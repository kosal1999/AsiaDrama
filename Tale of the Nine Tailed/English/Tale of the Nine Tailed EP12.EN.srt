1
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:56,974
TALE OF THE NINE TAILED

2
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,060
MANCHURIA

3
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:01,353
Lord Lee Yeon!

4
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:04,023
You have a letter from Gyeongseong.

5
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:09,945
-Who is it from? Read it.
-Let's see.

6
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:14,742
"Flowers are falling.
That means it's almost my time to return.

7
00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:18,454
Being thrown into this era,
I went through a ton of trouble."

8
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:22,333
"Being thrown into this era,
I went through a ton of trouble,"

9
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,876
is what I wanted to write.

10
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:27,087
But looking back,
I feel like I dreamt a great nightmare.

11
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:30,299
You're merely high on opium
in the year 1938,

12
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:33,260
but I have quite a lot over there.

13
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:36,013
A platinum card, the latest massage chair,

14
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,225
and a high-frequency facial device.
The essence of anti-aging.

15
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:42,019
Oh, and I even have
a home theater in my house.

16
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:47,608
-What is he talking about?
-I'm not sure.

17
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:50,611
You don't know what it is,
but just feel the deprivation.

18
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,822
Because I'm just bragging.

19
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:54,824
This guy is a total lunatic, huh?

20
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,786
-He is Lord Lee Yeon too.
-Damn it.

21
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,746
The world will change like crazy.

22
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:05,251
Gyeongseong becomes an apartment complex,
and gods will lose their nesting grounds.

23
00:02:05,835 --> 00:02:07,962
People will no longer believe in legends.

24
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:12,925
We occasionally appear in TV series.

25
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:17,429
So don't regret it when the time comes,
and come back home.

26
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:21,809
This era still needs the nine-tailed fox,
their mountain god.

27
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,564
Come back and stay by Rang's side.

28
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,984
Rang doesn't have much time left.

29
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:33,362
So protect that kid in my place.

30
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,492
Gosh, forget it. How dare he lecture me.

31
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:42,621
Wait a minute.
I think you should take a look at this.

32
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:44,373
Geez.

33
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,835
"Postscript.

34
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:51,046
By the way, I forgot to say one thing.

35
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:55,926
She is there, back home."

36
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,100
She? She? Wow, what in the world?

37
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,186
Lady Ah-eum must have been reborn!

38
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,024
SHE IS THERE, BACK HOME.

39
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:15,195
Shin-ju, pack my bags.

40
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:21,660
Let's go back.

41
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:24,038
To Gyeongseong.

42
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:28,375
D-DAY
9 HOURS BEFORE THE LUNAR ECLIPSE

43
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:34,590
Are you scared?

44
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,642
I'm not scared.

45
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,146
Because Madame Ryu
has never abandoned us before.

46
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:53,817
She will come.

47
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,821
I'm sure she will.

48
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,622
FINAL EPISODE

49
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:27,309
Would you like to wear it to the venue?
Or shall I wrap it up for you?

50
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:31,188
-I should try it on, no?
-The fitting room is this way.

51
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:43,951
I think the pants are a bit long.

52
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:49,164
Maybe you just have short legs.

53
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,255
So, it was you?
The prick known as the Chief Commissioner.

54
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:59,508
I told you that we'd meet again.

55
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,303
So what are you?

56
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:08,142
Daitengu.

57
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,728
A DEMON WORSHIPPED
AS A MOUNTAIN GOD OF JAPAN

58
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,272
A respected monk in my living years,

59
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,816
and the mainland's mountain god
before the war broke out.

60
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,609
A mountain god?

61
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:20,821
As a mountain god myself,
I'm quite interested in you.

62
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,158
Then come on.
It'll be the fight of the mountain gods.

63
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:26,994
I have a wedding to attend.

64
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:30,330
Hey, if you die,
I'll hold a posthumous wedding for you.

65
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:33,125
Aren't you here for the hostages?
Did you bring the treasures?

66
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,585
Of course I didn't.

67
00:05:37,755 --> 00:05:43,343
If you die, I can't find the treasures.
And if I die, you can't find the hostages.

68
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,888
Let's make an exchange, fair and square.

69
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,515
Didn't get a proper education, huh?

70
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:51,060
You must not know
the meaning of the word "fair."

71
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:54,354
Haven't you read the papers?
You lost your country 28 years ago.

72
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,191
If I say it's fair, then it's fair.

73
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,902
Bring me the ruler and stone.

74
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:04,031
Geez, you're so clueless.
I don't have the golden ruler anymore.

75
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,950
The northern mountain god used it up.
Only the stone remains.

76
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:10,120
-Give me that at least.
-Why do you even need it?

77
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,957
I hear it creates
the greatest barrier in the world.

78
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:18,003
Our empire is at war now,
and it is my duty to protect the mainland.

79
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,006
Well, my duty is to take it back home.

80
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:26,970
If you don't find the treasure today,
the hostages will die.

81
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:32,059
And if I find the hostages,
you will die today.

82
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:38,816
Catch the tail starts now.

83
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:41,985
It's already…

84
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,115
begun over here.

85
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:50,077
What did you just say?

86
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,704
Only one of the hostages can live.

87
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,623
-What?
-One is like…

88
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,333
another pair of Madame's hands,

89
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,710
while the other is this one's girlfriend.

90
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:01,630
We'll only let one of them live.

91
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:02,714
What do you want?

92
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:06,301
Fight the fox and retrieve the treasure.
Whoever comes first gets their hostage.

93
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:13,016
Don't Joseon pricks fight each other
all the time anyway?

94
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:16,854
-I'll kill you!
-That won't fix anything.

95
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:27,656
Let Jae-yoo go.
He has nothing to do with this.

96
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,953
We gave you many chances.
You stabbed us in the back every time.

97
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:37,666
But most of all,
I really wanted to see that expression.

98
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:51,430
I don't know if you have time for this.

99
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:57,227
Run like hell.
Because the two of you are rivals now.

100
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:10,490
What will you do? He wants you
to pick the stone or the hostages.

101
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,452
Lord Lee Yeon, please save our Yeo-hee.

102
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:17,122
The lunar eclipse is today.

103
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:19,583
Yield the stone and there's no way back.

104
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,420
We have less than six hours left.
Say something!

105
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:28,091
-Shin-ju, go and…
-Yes, sir. Where should I start?

106
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:32,512
-…get me a cup of iced Americano.
-Iced coffee? Amidst all of this?

107
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:36,141
Yeah, he's starting a battle of wits.
Caffeine is a must.

108
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,610
Gross, why is it so bitter?
What is it, poison?

109
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,070
You sure are picky, sir.

110
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,198
Let's go to Myoyeongak.

111
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:53,909
Water Snail Bride, go get the bride.

112
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,161
And you, gather everyone involved.

113
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:05,837
-You know where the treasure is, huh?
-You're willing to betray Lee Yeon?

114
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:08,173
I'm all Jae-yoo has.

115
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:10,801
That's what Jindos are like.

116
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,470
Foolishly serving one owner
for a lifetime.

117
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,640
Enduring everything,
believing I'll come for him.

118
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:19,977
What about Lee Yeon?
He can't go home without the stone.

119
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,896
Let's be honest.

120
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:28,610
Yeon remaining here
is what you and I both want, no?

121
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:37,286
Gosh. You must know when to let go.

122
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:41,957
-Yeon.
-I know you two have a lot on your minds.

123
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:45,252
So make up your mind right now.

124
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:49,923
Either get played on their grill
and become barbecued meat,

125
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,386
or turn that grill over with me.

126
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:59,099
D-5 HOURS 30 MINUTES

127
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:02,060
We have all gathered here with two goals.

128
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,105
First, rescue the two hostages safely.

129
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:09,818
Second, abolish the villain of the piece.
The Chief Commissioner's ring.

130
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,488
Our weakness is time.

131
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,867
The lunar eclipse will be over
at 7:00 p.m.

132
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,662
We must save them,
and catch the shits within the time limit.

133
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,332
We have five hours.

134
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,085
Someone could get hurt or die.

135
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,422
If you want to live, leave now…

136
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,679
is what I want to say with style.

137
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:42,142
But I really need you all.

138
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,898
Okay then. Let's move in teams now.

139
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,067
First, you guys search for the hostages.

140
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:52,402
How do we find them?

141
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:55,030
The estimated time of the kidnappings
is around ten o'clock.

142
00:10:55,864 --> 00:11:01,244
Since this is an era with no curfew,
there must be an eyewitness.

143
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:04,539
Anyone have their photos?
I'll need it to investigate.

144
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:06,249
-No.
-Me neither.

145
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:08,794
Raise your hand if you draw well.

146
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:11,797
Okay, Azalea.

147
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:19,930
Dogs have better hearing
and visual acuity than humans.

148
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,681
You can talk to animals, right?

149
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,518
Attention!

150
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,687
I hear you're the top three in this town.
Are you number one?

151
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,190
Then, you? Or you?

152
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:33,527
Tell all domestic and stray dogs
living in Gyeongseong

153
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,654
we are looking for this man.

154
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:40,575
This guy.

155
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,244
He is a kidnapped native Jindo.

156
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,329
Use your sense of duty
for one of your own.

157
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,499
What is it?

158
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:51,586
My goodness.

159
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,756
You're a mixed breed,
so you don't like native Jindos?

160
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:01,388
Even if the reward is this much?

161
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,390
Go! Off you go!

162
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,184
I'm counting on you.

163
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,860
Boss's missus has been kidnapped.
Find her, on the bandit gang's honor!

164
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:16,736
-Yes, sir!
-Are you the boss?

165
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,365
Yes, sir-- Oh, my apologies.
I was just in the moment.

166
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:21,908
We promise to bring her back.

167
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:23,785
-Let's go!
-Yes, sir!

168
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,831
You guys prepare to ambush the wedding.

169
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,041
I'll join as soon as we finish up here.

170
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:34,463
Problem is, we have bombs but no weapons.
They cleaned out the organization.

171
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:37,883
Follow me.

172
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,100
Are you going to war?

173
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,395
I collected them by selling gold.

174
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:52,564
I had a feeling
a day like this would come.

175
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,150
But how do we sneak all these in?

176
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:59,821
My face is already exposed,
and the hotel security will be tight.

177
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,782
We have them.

178
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:09,706
Your lives are as precious
as Joseon is to me.

179
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,085
Don't ever get hurt.

180
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,314
Inspection.

181
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:37,317
I am Ginko Tawara.

182
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,320
These are my bridal attendants.

183
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:43,448
My apologies.
There was an order to heighten security.

184
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,246
You, open it.

185
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,085
What is it?

186
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:57,462
A gayageum.

187
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,973
Jook-hyang, make rice balls
and feed the girls as they come.

188
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,558
-Yes, ma'am.
-Up top.

189
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:15,814
I'll go visit Taluipa.
We just need her thousand-mile eyes.

190
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:18,108
Hong-joo.

191
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,028
You know, right?
We've never been defeated as a team.

192
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,031
We'll find them safely.

193
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:27,117
I believe you.

194
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:57,105
Yes, their movements are unusual.
The hotel security should be heightened.

195
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,149
-Please give me the chance--
-Do it then.

196
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,734
Yes, sir. All right.

197
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,486
Everyone, attention!

198
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,699
We received intel the enemy dares to raid
a wedding the Governor will be attending.

199
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,827
-Stop them with your lives!
-Yes, sir!

200
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:21,630
They say
he's on a frantic hunt for the hostages.

201
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:24,132
Probably.

202
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,052
Shall we move the hostages?

203
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,680
That won't be necessary.

204
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:34,684
If they find the hostages,
our plan will come to nothing.

205
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,064
Go there immediately.

206
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:40,732
You'll do as I say.

207
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:49,949
Yes, sir.

208
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,900
Everyone, please hurry a bit more.

209
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:07,694
D-3 HOURS 15 MINUTES

210
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,750
-Grandpa Hyunuiong!
-Hong-joo! Here to see the old hag?

211
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:25,211
-Yes. She's at the office, right?
-Don't go now. She has a guest coming.

212
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:26,838
A guest? Who?

213
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:30,675
Well, I don't know who,
but I'm to stay away until it's dark.

214
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:33,261
Whatever, I have no time for that.
Step on it.

215
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:39,559
Geez, that temper of hers.

216
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:44,647
She's just like the old hag!
Goodness gracious me.

217
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,280
Old hag, let me borrow your eyes!
It's urgent!

218
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:41,246
What is it?
Why are you just standing like that?

219
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:53,633
Wh-- What's wrong with your eyes?

220
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,889
The original mountain god. He is back.

221
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,893
I failed to seal him off. As a result…

222
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:09,023
my thousand-mile eyes
have fallen into his hands.

223
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:15,071
The original mountain god?
What do you mean?

224
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:17,991
We must send
the guardian stone to the future.

225
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:25,748
Tell Yeon that he must be back
on time today, no matter what.

226
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,960
Take charge of returning the stone.

227
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:35,008
If he collects all four treasures,
it will be the end of the world.

228
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:38,928
The end of the world?

229
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:44,767
Where is Moo-yeong? If he was revived
using the ruler, then where's Moo-yeong?

230
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,562
It's best you don't know for now.

231
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:52,942
The truck that took them
vanished by the Independence Gate.

232
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:56,195
The neighboring dogs say
the trucks moved independence activists.

233
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,531
Independence Gate, independence activists.

234
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,035
-Seodaemun prison!
-Seodaemun prison! Let's go.

235
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:05,872
-Hold on. Something's off.
-What is?

236
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,832
We found them too easily.

237
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:11,502
We don't have more time to think.
The wedding is starting soon, no?

238
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:14,088
Leave this to me.
You finish the Chief Commissioner.

239
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:16,758
-Come on.
-What? Yes, ma'am.

240
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,594
-I'll get going.
-Rang.

241
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:22,847
Years ago, Father told me this.

242
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:29,687
"You have a younger brother,
and he may surpass you someday."

243
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:31,898
Geez, you liar.

244
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,777
The thing is,
even if you are a half-breed,

245
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:39,447
you are my little brother
and a member of the pack.

246
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:41,866
If you ever have to risk your life,

247
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:45,620
believe in yourself,
just like I believe in you.

248
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,334
Well, that isn't so bad to hear.

249
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,422
You must come back alive too.

250
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,007
No, wait.

251
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:00,885
The thing is…

252
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:04,597
there's something I've never said before.

253
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:08,559
-I love--
-Shut up!

254
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:09,644
Yeah.

255
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:13,982
-Hey, Mi-yeon! Hey!
-What?

256
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,651
Give me your shoes and take these.

257
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:21,990
Wear those and if you think you might die,
run away as fast as you can.

258
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,742
Isn't this a limited edition or whatever?

259
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:28,371
Limited editions or not,
you were my limited editions here.

260
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,455
Dear friend!

261
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,670
-Hurry and go!
-Start the car.

262
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:40,091
-Hey. I'll see you!
-Go on.

263
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,342
We should go too.

264
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:58,484
D-2 HOURS 10 MINUTES

265
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:01,320
Search thoroughly!

266
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:14,500
Where do we plant the bombs?
Somewhere out of sight?

267
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:17,754
No, somewhere in plain sight.

268
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,006
Right under their nose.

269
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:28,639
Hey!

270
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,601
What are you doing here?

271
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,024
Miss Eun-ho requested
that I be her wedding helper.

272
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,151
What about you?

273
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:43,821
Oh, I'm taking charge of security
for the Chief Commissioner.

274
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:47,033
If I do well,
I might become a police chief.

275
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:48,993
Ouch!

276
00:22:56,918 --> 00:23:00,171
Hey, why is your hand trembling so much?

277
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:03,174
She has hand tremors.

278
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:10,223
Guys, we have much to do.
So let's hurry and go.

279
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:30,284
-It's the chief's orders.
-What's this?

280
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:32,787
The gwiso tree. Inject it right now.

281
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,372
GWISO TREE:
A HAUNTED WHISTLING TREE

282
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:35,790
WHERE THOSE WHO HEAR IT GO MAD

283
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,009
Why, you bastard!

284
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:53,599
Damn it. One is shattered!

285
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,480
Which one should we go with? This one?

286
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:04,360
No, go with that one.
The female mountain god cherishes him.

287
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:13,870
Let go! Let go!

288
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:26,215
You should play your part too.

289
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:38,895
Yeo-hee!

290
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,363
They're all empty!

291
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:58,789
-Yeo-hee!
-You're late! I almost got bored to death.

292
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:01,083
Yeo-hee.

293
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:02,877
Stop right there.

294
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:06,797
Oh, my? How handsome.

295
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:08,966
You're still alive?

296
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,593
Damn, that bitch is here too.

297
00:25:11,636 --> 00:25:13,304
Can you not talk to me, please?

298
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:16,724
-You dare lay a finger on her--
-Oh, no?

299
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,185
-I already did.
-I'll kill you!

300
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,270
Take one more step.

301
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:37,912
I took one step. Now what?

302
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:41,749
Where's Jae-yoo?

303
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:45,795
-I'm going!
-Let's go together!

304
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,338
-I don't need you.
-Hey!

305
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,720
I'm so sorry. I should've come sooner.

306
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:01,686
I thought I lost my whole world overnight.

307
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:20,037
Jae-yoo!

308
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:22,790
Jae-yoo!

309
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:25,876
Jae-yoo, answer me!

310
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:27,962
Jae-yoo!

311
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:30,756
She fell for our trap, huh?

312
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,719
She must've come looking for you?

313
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,264
Jae-yoo! If you can hear me, answer me!

314
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:41,559
-Answer.
-No.

315
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,691
Jae-yoo! Can you hear me?

316
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:53,696
Jae-yoo!

317
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:04,248
Well, then.
Have a great time with your owner now.

318
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:19,055
Jae-yoo! Jae-yoo!

319
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:21,974
Jae-yoo. Jae-yoo.

320
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,436
Hey, open your eyes. It's me. Jae-yoo!

321
00:27:26,354 --> 00:27:27,355
Madame?

322
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,359
You're alive. Indeed, you are.

323
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:34,987
You can't.

324
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:37,531
Don't untie me.

325
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:41,369
-If you do--
-Are you okay? Are you hurt?

326
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:53,964
You shouldn't be here.

327
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:56,634
-Let's--
-You can't!

328
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:23,911
Jae-yoo!

329
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:28,999
What's with you?

330
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:31,794
It's me, Hong-joo.

331
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:33,921
Die.

332
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,590
-Die. Die!
-Yoo Jae-yoo!

333
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:38,509
Get ahold of yourself!

334
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:49,687
It's okay.

335
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:52,982
Everything will be okay.

336
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,865
Madame?

337
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:04,452
Yes. Yes, it's me.

338
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:07,621
Did I do that?

339
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,667
How could I do this to you, Madame?

340
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,419
What did they do to you?

341
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:17,256
Jae-yoo.

342
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:19,467
Jae-yoo.

343
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:24,180
Someone keeps whistling in my head.

344
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:25,806
A whistle?

345
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,565
No way. The gwiso tree?

346
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:40,070
Please go. I can't resist it any longer.

347
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:42,740
Not without you.
I'm bringing you, even if I die.

348
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:46,660
I can't go. They said it's irreversible
once I hear the whistling.

349
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:49,830
There must be a way, right?
I'll find a way.

350
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:53,501
-Jae-yoo.
-Please! Please get away!

351
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:55,127
Jae-yoo! Jae-yoo!

352
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:58,130
Jae-yoo.

353
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:03,302
I will serve one master
until the day I die.

354
00:30:16,357 --> 00:30:17,733
Don't cry.

355
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:20,486
No, Jae-yoo!

356
00:30:23,072 --> 00:30:24,323
No, you can't!

357
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:28,327
No, you can't. No!

358
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,413
No!

359
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:36,252
Jae-yoo!

360
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:41,799
Your mom is asleep.

361
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:44,426
She took a sleeping pill
thinking it was a headache pill.

362
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:48,389
I swapped them.

363
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:51,809
-What?
-Mother doesn't deserve to be here.

364
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:55,980
Why you little brat!
How dare you speak of your mom that way!

365
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:00,568
The Governor-General has arrived.

366
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:18,586
Koo Shin-ju and Lee Yeon.
Why aren't they here yet?

367
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:29,680
Shin-ju,
how long will it take to go to Taluipa?

368
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:32,474
It's a 15 minute drive.
We must leave by 6:40 p.m.

369
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:35,853
-Let's go.
-Lord Lee Yeon.

370
00:31:36,437 --> 00:31:38,897
Tell me one thing.
That we'll make it back alive.

371
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:43,986
I brought you here.
I'll take you back home safely.

372
00:31:52,453 --> 00:31:56,332
Goodness. How will we get through that?

373
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:59,168
Hey, I'm a nine-tailed fox.

374
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:06,008
Damn it.

375
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:11,513
Fool. I lured the female mountain god
to have you isolated.

376
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:14,767
-Take Yeo-hee and go.
-No, Boss. Let's go together.

377
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:17,061
-Get out!
-Damn it!

378
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:18,812
Okay, let's go.

379
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:21,899
What the hell?

380
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:25,569
No one can leave
without Yuki's permission!

381
00:32:37,665 --> 00:32:40,084
Oh, my. You're a weak one, huh?

382
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:48,217
I was expecting more from another fox,
but you're not much.

383
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,512
No need to use our skills.
Just play with him.

384
00:33:00,104 --> 00:33:01,605
Boss!

385
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:16,662
Damn it. You okay, sir?

386
00:33:30,718 --> 00:33:31,802
Hey, you!

387
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:55,743
-Boss!
-Don't come!

388
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:57,786
Don't come. Protect Yeo-hee!

389
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:45,459
How is he related to that nine-tailed fox?

390
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:47,085
I have an older brother too.

391
00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:50,047
His name is Akira,
and he's much weaker than me.

392
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:54,426
I saved him a few times,
but one day I thought,

393
00:34:55,803 --> 00:34:59,097
"How bothersome.
Weak pricks should just be culled."

394
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:05,020
Though he hasn't said it, your brother
is probably thinking the same thing.

395
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,815
So, he's a half-breed, huh?

396
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:12,736
A piece of trash who couldn't become
a full nine-tailed fox or a full human.

397
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,862
Illegitimate child!

398
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:16,824
-That's the illegitimate child of a fox!
-Kill him! Kill him!

399
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,786
Die! Die! Die! Die!

400
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:24,498
You should not have been born.

401
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:28,001
I did everything I could to eliminate you
from my womb.

402
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:33,215
You are a monster, my baby.

403
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:44,226
No, Jae-yoo. No, Jae-yoo.

404
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:51,066
Even if I'm gone,
don't go around with blood on you.

405
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,404
No. No, Jae-yoo!

406
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,700
It was an honor to serve you, ma'am.

407
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:07,541
You were a great comfort to us
who had been abandoned by the world.

408
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,638
Are you alone? Wanna come with me?

409
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:28,312
Don't do this, Jae-yoo. Don't leave me.

410
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:33,859
I've already lost too much blood.

411
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:38,238
No, you said you'd serve one master
until the day you die.

412
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:41,491
You said you'd do whatever I say!

413
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:43,785
So wake up. Wake up!

414
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,208
Don't speak that way to my boss!

415
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,296
Oogama.

416
00:37:02,346 --> 00:37:03,388
No.

417
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:06,475
Don't look.

418
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:28,080
No.

419
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:31,208
Die.

420
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:33,418
Die!

421
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:39,591
You're wrong.

422
00:37:40,968 --> 00:37:42,511
Even if you're a half-breed,

423
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:45,764
you are my little brother
and a member of the pack.

424
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:47,849
If you ever have to risk your life,

425
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:52,688
believe in yourself,
just like I believe in you.

426
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:54,606
I can't.

427
00:37:58,402 --> 00:38:00,529
Oogama, finish him!

428
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:05,450
Rang!

429
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:38,066
Both his eyes have changed?

430
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:14,102
Years ago, Father told me this.

431
00:39:14,895 --> 00:39:20,567
"You have a younger brother,
and he may surpass you someday."

432
00:39:45,509 --> 00:39:46,885
Oogama!

433
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:12,035
You're just a half-breed.

434
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:22,546
I am a nine-tailed fox.

435
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:34,349
Boss.

436
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,187
Boss, are you okay?

437
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:41,606
-Boss!
-Let's go.

438
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:47,028
Gosh, we survived. We're alive!

439
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:48,530
Goodness.

440
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:06,464
Someone keeps whistling in my ear.

441
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:11,970
It's so noisy, I'll just kill them all.

442
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:37,495
The real Lee Yeon is here.

443
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:46,046
Yoo Jae-yoo, I order you to wake up!

444
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:49,216
Wake up, so we can go home.

445
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:53,386
Home.

446
00:41:55,388 --> 00:42:00,143
Born as a stray dog,
that was the first home I ever had.

447
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:03,271
But now…

448
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:07,484
there's no way back.

449
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,779
Jae-yoo, how can you…

450
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:13,573
How can you do this to me?

451
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:16,868
You crying?

452
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,832
Wow, you're crying a lot.

453
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,002
It's been a while.

454
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:29,798
-He looks like he's dying.
-Get lost.

455
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:33,343
I thought I'd give you something good,
but not if you don't want it.

456
00:42:35,804 --> 00:42:38,765
I won this in a difficult bet
with the Willow Boy.

457
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:42,769
The Willow Boy?

458
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:46,773
-No way.
-The pisali flower.

459
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:49,109
PISALI FLOWER:
A FLOWER FROM THE TALE

460
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:50,527
"YEON AND THE WILLOW BOY"

461
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,612
ENABLES ONE'S BLOOD TO FLOW AGAIN

462
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:06,042
D-1 HOUR

463
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:07,711
Everyone, please be seated.

464
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:14,259
The Governor-General
will soon announce the wedding

465
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:17,595
of Chief Commissioner Ryuhei Kato
and Miss Ginko Tawara.

466
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:22,267
Please welcome the groom
with a big round of applause.

467
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:37,866
Please welcome the bride.

468
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:57,719
Follow me.

469
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:15,779
Now, a congratulatory message
will be given by the Governor-General.

470
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:17,572
Everyone, please stand.

471
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:32,128
I am the aforementioned
Governor-General, Tamura.

472
00:44:32,212 --> 00:44:36,341
This marriage is a testament
to the union of Joseon and Japan.

473
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:39,511
As the Chief Commissioner
of the Governor-General of Korea,

474
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:42,889
this man went to war
to protect the security of Joseon.

475
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:44,599
Mr. Ryuhei Kato.

476
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:48,436
And she is the daughter

477
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:52,857
of a family who love their country so much
that they donated two airplanes.

478
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:54,984
Miss Ginko Tawara.

479
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:58,613
We hope this marriage will serve
as a foundation for the great undertaking

480
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:02,659
of the establishment of a new East Asia.

481
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:06,704
I wish your marriage all the best
from the bottom of my heart.

482
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:09,374
-And now--
-Hold on.

483
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:11,543
May I say something too?

484
00:45:16,423 --> 00:45:19,384
Thank you to all the guests
who came to this wedding.

485
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:23,388
-You all being here is convenient.
-What the hell are you doing?

486
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:28,268
I hope you all rest in peace, in advance.

487
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:31,646
Fortunately, this place will be your tomb.

488
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:34,774
Ginko!

489
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:38,695
Hey.

490
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:40,196
What are you?

491
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:42,407
Me?

492
00:46:01,593 --> 00:46:04,387
Me? I'm Joseon's last mountain god.

493
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:20,737
Protect the Governor-General!
The Governor-General!

494
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:21,988
-Protect him!
-Here!

495
00:46:34,209 --> 00:46:35,585
Ambush!

496
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:38,087
Been a while. Jirisan crazy fox returns!

497
00:46:39,047 --> 00:46:41,216
-Hey, run!
-Run!

498
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:52,810
Hurry! Close the door!

499
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:54,020
Close the door!

500
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:35,186
Why do you defy the empire?

501
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:37,647
I'm sort of setting an example.

502
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:44,404
Because I think we should show you guys
that we will fight to the end.

503
00:49:57,286 --> 00:49:58,496
Ginko.

504
00:50:00,248 --> 00:50:01,666
Wait, wait!

505
00:50:15,096 --> 00:50:16,180
Ginko Tawara.

506
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:21,102
Born as Sho Tawara's daughter
on this land of Joseon.

507
00:50:21,728 --> 00:50:25,898
You could've been anything,
but why of all things--

508
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:27,358
I could've been anything.

509
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:31,070
The first female newspaper reporter,
the owner of this hotel,

510
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:33,114
or a gold mining big shot.

511
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:37,910
But Dad, I decided
to become an independence activist.

512
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:42,582
Not as Ginko Tawara, but as Sunwoo Eun-ho.

513
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,377
I really like that name you gave me.

514
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:04,479
You're not my daughter!

515
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:11,486
Run away, Eun-ho!
The bomb will go off soon!

516
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:26,793
Our Governor has been shot!

517
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:29,128
It wasn't me.

518
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,964
But why?

519
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:18,261
Hey, let's draw the line here.
I have important plans at seven o'clock.

520
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:23,891
You're laughing?

521
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:28,062
That's why I've prepared
something for you.

522
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:37,446
Is this what you're looking for?

523
00:52:44,954 --> 00:52:46,289
Geez, damn it.

524
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:59,802
Thankfully, it's just a graze.
Hurry and go to the hospital.

525
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:06,309
We won't meet again, will we?

526
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:15,401
No one may remember the name
Sunwoo Eun-ho in the future.

527
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:18,571
But I won't ever forget…

528
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,241
how hard you fought.

529
00:53:28,664 --> 00:53:30,166
That's all I need.

530
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:35,796
It was nice meeting you, comrade.

531
00:53:39,342 --> 00:53:41,010
You too, comrade.

532
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:55,733
Oh. My goodness.

533
00:53:58,194 --> 00:54:01,322
Why did you detonate the-- Oh, shit.

534
00:54:24,971 --> 00:54:27,390
Geez. This was expensive, you know.

535
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,293
Will you alone be able to change Joseon?

536
00:54:58,337 --> 00:55:02,299
Will catching me alone
make this country independent?

537
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:04,218
You…

538
00:55:05,678 --> 00:55:06,762
want a spoiler?

539
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:12,309
On August 15, 1945…

540
00:55:14,854 --> 00:55:19,442
Japan is defeated in the war,
and Joseon becomes independent.

541
00:55:21,277 --> 00:55:26,741
You won't even be able to
lift your flag up for a while,

542
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,452
or even sing your national anthem.

543
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:30,578
What?

544
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:48,596
Nevertheless…

545
00:55:51,057 --> 00:55:53,142
you won't live to see that future.

546
00:55:53,642 --> 00:55:54,977
You know why?

547
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:57,897
Because you will die here today.

548
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:02,151
By my hands.

549
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:25,925
-Where are you going in that state, Boss?
-I have something to tell Lee Yeon.

550
00:56:26,008 --> 00:56:27,051
No, wait.

551
00:56:32,848 --> 00:56:35,976
It's about time we finished this, no?

552
00:56:58,165 --> 00:57:01,919
You are not the owners of this land.

553
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:07,466
How dare a mere mountain god of Joseon…

554
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:30,531
Damn, that stings!

555
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:33,492
-Don't move!
-Wait, wait a minute.

556
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:38,706
Gosh, why can't things go easy for once?

557
00:57:45,254 --> 00:57:50,259
You may not know this but I'm not
the only mountain god on this land.

558
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:11,405
Listen up, everyone.
I'm having a crappy day, okay?

559
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:14,867
So none of you will make it out alive.

560
00:58:18,454 --> 00:58:20,623
-Lord Lee Yeon! Hurry!
-Okay.

561
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:23,918
-Go, leave this to me.
-And the others?

562
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,670
Everyone's fine, even your brother.

563
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,717
-I'll get going then.
-Goodbye.

564
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:35,512
You helped me decide
which name to live by.

565
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:38,390
Ryu Hong-joo, mountain god of the west.

566
00:58:39,725 --> 00:58:42,686
That name suits you better than
the Madame of Myoyeongak.

567
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,569
I'm going to miss you, Lee Yeon.

568
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:54,990
Thanks.

569
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:58,786
Hurry, go.

570
00:59:21,642 --> 00:59:22,643
What's wrong?

571
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:24,270
-The car won't start.
-Damn it.

572
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:25,813
Get them!

573
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,860
Hey, we don't have time. Hurry up!

574
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:33,988
Come on. Please start!

575
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:37,825
Shoot!

576
00:59:46,292 --> 00:59:49,586
The lunar eclipse is about to end.
Why the hell aren't they here?

577
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:50,921
Yeon will come.

578
00:59:52,631 --> 00:59:53,966
I keep getting a bad feeling.

579
00:59:55,217 --> 00:59:57,219
Where did the original mountain god go?

580
00:59:58,262 --> 01:00:00,889
That's enough. It's out of your hands now.

581
01:00:00,973 --> 01:00:04,268
You've lost your eyes,
so stop if you don't want to lose me too.

582
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:05,561
You'll get hurt!

583
01:00:16,155 --> 01:00:17,156
Go take a look.

584
01:00:31,462 --> 01:00:35,257
-Am I too late?
-No, your timing's perfect.

585
01:00:36,884 --> 01:00:37,885
Moo-yeong.

586
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:42,514
Moo-yeong. Moo-yeong.

587
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:51,899
The fortune god has come to keep her word.

588
01:00:54,943 --> 01:00:56,570
By any chance…

589
01:00:58,822 --> 01:00:59,990
can you save him?

590
01:01:02,034 --> 01:01:04,203
His soul hasn't left
the world of the living yet.

591
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:06,413
Shall I call his soul?

592
01:01:09,917 --> 01:01:10,959
What did she say?

593
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:14,004
She says to save your wish,

594
01:01:14,088 --> 01:01:17,049
because you will still lose your way.

595
01:01:23,097 --> 01:01:27,184
I'll find my own way. So, please.

596
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:28,435
Shoot!

597
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,068
Hurry and go. I'll handle this.

598
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:39,071
Thank you, Cheon Moo-yeong!

599
01:01:53,252 --> 01:01:54,253
Let me ask this.

600
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:57,214
Why did you save me?

601
01:01:58,257 --> 01:02:00,634
Do we need a reason to save one another?

602
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:06,098
We're friends again, right?

603
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:19,903
Thank you.

604
01:02:45,012 --> 01:02:46,180
Hurry!

605
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:01,361
Oh, honey! The kids are here!

606
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:04,490
-Great work till the end. Goodness!
-Old man.

607
01:03:05,157 --> 01:03:06,575
Thank you for everything.

608
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:11,955
So, does Joseon achieve liberation?

609
01:03:18,879 --> 01:03:19,963
Go, now.

610
01:03:22,174 --> 01:03:25,052
-Is your eye okay?
-You resent me, don't you?

611
01:03:26,637 --> 01:03:28,639
I've done horrible things
to you and Moo-yeong.

612
01:03:29,389 --> 01:03:32,017
I'll do the resenting,
so stay out of it, old hag.

613
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:35,646
I know you hated doing it.
Don't put a lid on your heart's burdens.

614
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:37,814
Let me just ask one question.

615
01:03:38,524 --> 01:03:41,777
Was I a good parent to you all?

616
01:03:42,778 --> 01:03:44,029
Not a chance!

617
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:50,577
But the three of us
really liked you, old hag.

618
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:57,125
Hey, Yeon! You only have two minutes.

619
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:08,011
I haven't said farewell to Rang yet.

620
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:14,726
Lord Lee Yeon, we must go.

621
01:04:33,996 --> 01:04:35,080
Lee Yeon!

622
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:43,797
Rang.

623
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:47,926
You're a mess.

624
01:04:49,678 --> 01:04:50,679
I won.

625
01:04:52,264 --> 01:04:56,643
Even without you,
I can fight vigorously on my own now.

626
01:04:57,978 --> 01:05:01,940
So, I will be fine.
I really wanted to tell you that.

627
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:10,490
Good job. I knew you'd make it.

628
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:12,909
And here.

629
01:05:14,453 --> 01:05:18,123
It's nothing much,
but they say it brings good fortune.

630
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:20,876
So you don't forget me.

631
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:32,262
How could I?

632
01:05:34,181 --> 01:05:36,141
You're my one and only little brother.

633
01:05:37,643 --> 01:05:41,813
I wanted to send you off with a smile,
but I'm sorry…

634
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:47,819
I don't think I can keep that promise.

635
01:05:54,326 --> 01:05:55,577
You a little kid?

636
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:01,124
I'll get going.

637
01:06:37,285 --> 01:06:39,705
Goodbye, brother.

638
01:06:47,087 --> 01:06:48,463
Goodbye.

639
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:18,952
You think Yeon got back safely?

640
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:22,998
Probably.

641
01:07:25,292 --> 01:07:26,710
Where are you headed now?

642
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:32,966
Anywhere is good,
if it's an era you're living in, Hong-joo.

643
01:07:34,259 --> 01:07:35,427
Shall we go together?

644
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:37,846
Yeah.

645
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:41,933
I would love to.

646
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:46,062
But I might live
as a wandering doctor for a while.

647
01:07:48,273 --> 01:07:49,274
A doctor?

648
01:07:49,357 --> 01:07:53,653
Even at the brink of death,
all I could see was your face.

649
01:07:54,696 --> 01:07:55,697
So I made up my mind.

650
01:07:58,158 --> 01:08:02,871
For once, I want to live
as the person you know me as.

651
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:10,670
Until the world rules out the need
to cut anyone or anything.

652
01:08:13,381 --> 01:08:16,051
-Will you come back?
-Of course.

653
01:08:17,928 --> 01:08:21,264
-No matter how hard I try--
-You can't…

654
01:08:25,477 --> 01:08:26,895
get that far from me anyway.

655
01:09:12,566 --> 01:09:15,986
Lord Lee Yeon asked me to give you this
before he left.

656
01:09:27,455 --> 01:09:30,250
He learned from the girls
and embroidered it himself.

657
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:35,881
RYU HONG-JOO

658
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:59,946
Ages ago, I tore up your favorite daenggi.

659
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:05,285
You beat the living hell
out of me that day.

660
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:10,040
Back then,
that girl had that self-absorbed look.

661
01:10:10,916 --> 01:10:15,462
But she always risked her life
to protect Moo-yeong and I.

662
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:17,672
You haven't changed at all.

663
01:10:18,506 --> 01:10:22,010
You still fight to protect others.

664
01:10:22,844 --> 01:10:25,055
That's called an oldest child syndrome.

665
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:28,475
From the receiving end,
it was quite reassuring.

666
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:31,770
I owe you a lot, Hong-joo.

667
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:37,609
Though I knew how you felt, forgive me
for being shameless until the end.

668
01:10:39,653 --> 01:10:42,822
Hoping that you won't hurt because of me,

669
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,242
I have included this bribe.

670
01:11:23,989 --> 01:11:25,198
Yeon has left.

671
01:11:26,241 --> 01:11:29,703
It felt as if an era had come and gone.

672
01:11:31,246 --> 01:11:34,708
But surprisingly,
the world didn't change much.

673
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:38,503
Paper, paper!
A new Governor-General will be appointed!

674
01:11:38,586 --> 01:11:39,629
Paper, paper!

675
01:11:40,839 --> 01:11:44,509
Paper, paper!
A new Governor-General will be appointed!

676
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:46,219
Paper, paper!

677
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:51,349
Who are we?

678
01:11:51,433 --> 01:11:52,684
-Listen up.
-Yes, sir!

679
01:11:52,767 --> 01:11:54,269
The food should not get cold!

680
01:11:54,352 --> 01:11:55,729
-Yes, sir!
-Where are you going?

681
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:57,272
-Chungmuro, sir.
-Chungmuro.

682
01:11:57,355 --> 01:11:58,565
-Jingogae, sir.
-And you?

683
01:11:58,648 --> 01:12:00,650
-Seodaemun, sir.
-And you! Paw!

684
01:12:02,152 --> 01:12:03,153
Let's go!

685
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:05,864
Let's deliver this!

686
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:07,490
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

687
01:12:08,366 --> 01:12:10,160
We are the ones who have changed.

688
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:16,291
I hope to build a Korean school here.

689
01:12:21,379 --> 01:12:23,923
Where does it hurt?

690
01:12:25,467 --> 01:12:26,843
Pretending to be sick?

691
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:29,262
You need acupuncture!
Let me get out a huge needle!

692
01:12:49,157 --> 01:12:52,535
Funds for the war chest? All of them?

693
01:12:53,787 --> 01:12:56,790
You can't light a fire
if you put in the big firewood first.

694
01:12:56,873 --> 01:12:58,208
There must be a kindling.

695
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:00,919
Give it your best.

696
01:13:13,598 --> 01:13:14,891
-One.
-One!

697
01:13:17,268 --> 01:13:18,478
-Two.
-Two!

698
01:13:20,647 --> 01:13:23,399
-Madame, welcome back.
-Welcome back.

699
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:28,613
-Again, one.
-One!

700
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:32,534
-Two.
-Two!

701
01:13:34,119 --> 01:13:35,203
-Three.
-Three!

702
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:42,627
Hey, mermaid lady.
Heard anything about our family?

703
01:13:44,254 --> 01:13:46,464
Speaking of my lineage.

704
01:13:46,548 --> 01:13:48,925
Of the four mountain gods,

705
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:51,678
it's one that produced
the Baekdudaegan mountain god--

706
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:53,805
Gosh, stop repeating yourself!

707
01:13:56,057 --> 01:13:58,184
I only said it 13 times. Geez.

708
01:13:58,768 --> 01:13:59,936
Gosh, spit it out!

709
01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:02,564
-No, just--
-You smoke everything in sight!

710
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:06,317
Myoyeongak's newest guests
are fighting withdrawal symptoms.

711
01:14:07,026 --> 01:14:11,239
Lee Rang is taking care of his brother
as if he's paying off his childhood debt.

712
01:14:11,739 --> 01:14:13,908
But he doesn't seem to hate it at all.

713
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:22,125
-Bring me more rice.
-Yes, ma'am!

714
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:29,924
What do we do?
Madame has gone on a binge again.

715
01:14:30,008 --> 01:14:32,343
She's lonely
after Lord Lee Yeon's departure.

716
01:14:34,095 --> 01:14:36,806
Yesterday, she ate a whole cow.

717
01:14:41,227 --> 01:14:44,105
Rumors say it was due to the shock
of a broken heart.

718
01:14:46,274 --> 01:14:48,484
But if you believe that, you are mistaken.

719
01:15:17,347 --> 01:15:20,433
You the newly appointed
Governor-General of Korea?

720
01:15:21,976 --> 01:15:24,229
What is this? What are they?

721
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:30,985
Let's stomp on them.

722
01:15:33,238 --> 01:15:34,239
Open fire!

723
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:52,882
You said time flows differently
where you're from, right?

724
01:15:54,217 --> 01:15:57,762
What time flow are you treading right now,

725
01:15:58,680 --> 01:15:59,681
Yeon?

726
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:33,232
Am I too late?

727
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:42,075
No, I knew you would come back.

728
01:17:42,909 --> 01:17:44,202
As you always have.

729
01:17:45,787 --> 01:17:48,956
I missed you like crazy.

730
01:18:16,442 --> 01:18:21,072
TALE OF THE NINE TAILED

731
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:46,097
SPECIAL THANKS TO JO BO-AH
FOR HER APPEARANCE

732
01:19:14,167 --> 01:19:20,131
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
TALE OF THE NINE TAILED

733
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:26,304
So this is Joseon?

734
01:19:26,387 --> 01:19:29,390
