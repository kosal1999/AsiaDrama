1
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:56,974
TALE OF THE NINE TAILED

2
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,815
-One of them shows up at last.
-What are you?

3
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:10,529
Enemies passed water in fear
when hearing my name on the battlefield.

4
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:13,240
Don't be surprised.

5
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,661
Shinigami Mercenaries.
My name is Ushiuchibo.

6
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:20,164
USHIUCHIBO:
DEMON FROM JAPANESE FABLES

7
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,625
WHO HUNTS ANIMALS
WITH DEADLY POISON

8
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:26,212
What's that?

9
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:28,839
Just some pricks hunting Joseon demons.

10
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:34,094
-Doesn't seem like much in person.
-Whatever you are, go sit over there.

11
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:36,555
The Joseon mountain gods are mingling now.

12
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:39,141
Why is his head shaped like that?

13
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:41,352
You shits dare look down on me?

14
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:54,657
You all breathed in
a fog full of deadly poison.

15
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:56,325
You have a death wish?

16
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:58,118
You're the ones who will be dying!

17
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,038
Only I can neutralize my poison.

18
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:05,584
I heard there was a poison bender,
so I guess that's you, huh?

19
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:09,797
-You poisoned the Gyeongseong wells too.
-I see you've heard of my reputation.

20
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,925
Hand over the treasures.
Then, I'll spare their lives.

21
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,176
Don't be ridiculous.

22
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,431
Wh--

23
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,731
You have an hour at most.

24
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:31,235
Your body will be bled white,
and you will die in pain.

25
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,154
-Not to a wuss like him!
-Well?

26
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,950
-Will you give it up to save them? Or--
-Take it.

27
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:40,369
No, Yeon!
You can't give him the treasures!

28
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:41,662
What choice is there?

29
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,831
To catch the hare, you enter its burrow.

30
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,209
-A hare?
-Here you go.

31
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:48,669
Just like that?

32
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,841
The antidote.

33
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:55,467
Give it.

34
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:59,471
Now that I think about it,
the easiest way to get an antidote…

35
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:05,227
Is to use violence.

36
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,906
For ages,
we've called this, "hare and hounds."

37
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,785
Oh, gosh. Sumimasen.

38
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,622
We all have trust issues, you know.

39
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,374
-Shall we begin?
-Yes.

40
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:37,968
-Geez. You packed all that?
-Shall I slice him, shred him or peel him?

41
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,890
-Let's just chop him up.
-No. Then he'll die too soon.

42
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,518
I don't like his face,
so let's touch up his chin and nose.

43
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:47,811
That should fix him up.

44
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,605
You crazy bastards!

45
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:52,733
-Go with that one.
-Sure!

46
00:03:56,779 --> 00:04:02,117
Now I'll break your bones one at a time,
until we get the antidote.

47
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:10,000
Where did Ushiuchibo go?

48
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:13,128
EPISODE 10

49
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:14,755
I hear a sound.

50
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,508
It's Ushiuchibo.

51
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,636
There's someone next to him.

52
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:26,016
That punk wants
to take the treasures for himself!

53
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,102
That selfish prick.

54
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:29,895
I'll go take a look.

55
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:31,897
Yuki, wait for me!

56
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,161
Shall we take turns?

57
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:48,330
I haven't even started yet.

58
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:55,963
Hey.

59
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,508
-I'm the strongest mountain god.
-True, true.

60
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,719
It's harder not to hit you at full force.

61
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,265
For a mountain god who lost her country…

62
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,684
That sure is a lot of talk.

63
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:13,355
Starting now, I'll hit you thrice.

64
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,649
Provide the antidote by then
or I crack your head.

65
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:23,282
Squirm all you want.

66
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:27,494
Because you will all die here today.

67
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:29,663
Is that a laugh?

68
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,501
Hong-joo.

69
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,421
Move away!

70
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:44,511
I couldn't move my body.

71
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,683
This is his specialty.

72
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:52,853
Get out of my way.

73
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,825
-Strike one.
-Wait!

74
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:09,995
Strike two.

75
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,081
Boss!

76
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,296
Strike three.

77
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:32,017
He's dead. You shouldn't have killed him.

78
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,144
He kept pissing me off.

79
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,063
Now there's three of them left.

80
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:41,401
You knew from the start, didn't you?
That he spits poison when cornered.

81
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:42,903
Yeah.

82
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:44,780
Why didn't you tell us?

83
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,408
You two weren't interested in anything
but my treasure in the first place.

84
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,661
Gosh, you evil bastard.

85
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,371
We must get out of here now.

86
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,416
-The mercenaries will come at his call.
-We'll kill them all.

87
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,751
Not in our state.

88
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:01,505
Let's get out, and find a way
to neutralize the poison. Come on.

89
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,135
Wait for me!

90
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,303
I'm the only one unscathed anyway.

91
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:32,286
Please save me. Save me! It's here!

92
00:07:58,812 --> 00:07:59,897
Lord Lee Rang!

93
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,028
Over here, you bastards! Boss!

94
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,405
Be careful!
They can withstand blade slashes!

95
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,741
Hey, get Mrs. Boss to the room first!

96
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,833
Hurry and go upstairs! Leave this to me!

97
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,713
Come here! Die! Die!

98
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:27,674
-Hurry! We have to go too!
-Die, you all!

99
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,225
Geez! Why you--

100
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:39,144
Quick!

101
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,195
I'm scared. Gosh, I'm scared!

102
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:54,243
Whatever happens here tonight,
stay out of it.

103
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:58,664
Don't come, you shit!

104
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:08,340
-Jae-yoo!
-Our roommate's the best!

105
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,636
Please help me!

106
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:21,061
-What do we do?
-What do you mean "what"?

107
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,273
Please open the door!

108
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:25,691
He'll die out there!

109
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,610
Hey! Have you lost your mind?

110
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:33,824
Is anyone there?

111
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,597
-Don't ever come out of my room.
-And you?

112
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:58,682
I'll get the others.

113
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,476
Let me come with you.

114
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:04,938
I'll be back soon.

115
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:14,364
No!

116
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:21,538
Yeo-hee!

117
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,463
This is unbelievable!

118
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,132
Ushiuchibo is dead?

119
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:35,093
Joseon's mountain gods are this strong?

120
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:37,929
Gosh. The more I know,
the more fascinating he is.

121
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:42,267
Don't be ridiculous!
Ushiuchibo is the weakest of us all!

122
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:45,520
I wonder where
that lovely nine-tailed fox went.

123
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:48,398
Was it west?

124
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:51,777
Yuki, you can't act alone!

125
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,363
-I'll just go look around!
-Yuki!

126
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:57,032
Damn. Where the hell are they?

127
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,826
Hong-joo, hang in there. Okay?

128
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:11,505
Is it just me,
or did we pass here earlier?

129
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:13,799
What the hell is this forest?

130
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,176
It's from the picture in Room 404.

131
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,929
One of them can use an illusion charm.

132
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,681
They have someone
with such notable skills?

133
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,600
I guess he must be the boss.

134
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:32,901
-What's wrong with him?
-It's the poison.

135
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,612
My sight has been getting blurry
for some time too.

136
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,573
Hey, you okay?

137
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:39,991
Get your hands off me.

138
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:42,953
Oh, you prefer my feet then?
Hey, you okay?

139
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:46,790
Hey, Moo-yeong! Hey!

140
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,543
Yeon.

141
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,966
This poison is much more lethal
than I thought.

142
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,969
No, no. You can't collapse here, okay?

143
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:03,807
Hold on.

144
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,852
I don't like this at all.

145
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:08,728
You're a mercenary, huh?

146
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,608
-Is she your lover?
-She's my friend. Why?

147
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,861
She's not your girlfriend then?
What a relief.

148
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,572
I'm Yuki.

149
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:20,991
One moment.

150
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:25,120
What's that?

151
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,042
-Do you like snowmen?
-What?

152
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:33,920
Because Yuki gifts snowmen to her lovers.

153
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,009
Oh, whoa!

154
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,552
This represents my love.

155
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,763
-Hey, hey!
-Sheesh!

156
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,975
Why you little brat. This one's mine!

157
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:49,769
You crazy bitch! Yuki will have him!

158
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,815
-Wanna fight?
-Winner gets to have him.

159
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:57,986
Hey, don't discuss
my ownership with each other.

160
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,404
-Stay out of it!
-Stay out of it!

161
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,631
-Stop it. Enough.
-So unfair.

162
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,550
You're the one being unfair.
This one drank a bunch of poison.

163
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,054
Yuki!

164
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,224
-Yuki!
-It's Oogama.

165
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,019
-I have to go.
-Why is that?

166
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:33,980
This would be your chance
to take the treasures, no?

167
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,275
You're right.
But boss hates when I move on my own.

168
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:39,402
I see.

169
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:42,489
So where is that boss of yours?

170
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,617
You'll see him soon.

171
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:49,621
Yeon! You have to catch her!

172
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,178
Ice.

173
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:06,304
Oh, shit!

174
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:08,223
Damn it.

175
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:10,934
Geez, you almost got me!

176
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,271
-You know about me?
-Yeah.

177
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,733
I heard the rumor, all right.
The ice cream-like demon mercenary.

178
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,614
My real name is Yuki-onna.

179
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,866
YUKI-ONNA: SNOW LADY, SNOW
SPIRIT FROM JAPANESE FABLES

180
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,785
Yuki-onna, want to strike a deal with me?

181
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:30,954
A deal?

182
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,998
You…

183
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,917
-You came looking for these treasures, no?
-That's…

184
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,254
-Will you give them to Yuki?
-Be patient.

185
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:45,135
I'll give you one treasure.
If you'll exchange it for the antidote.

186
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,020
-Stop! If something happens to you--
-I don't care.

187
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,445
That's enough.

188
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,407
I'm dying, right?

189
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,201
You won't die.

190
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:14,789
What if I turn into one those monsters
and I don't even recognize you, Rang?

191
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:17,876
I won't let you.

192
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,382
I have a question.

193
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,137
Why did you save me back then?

194
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:32,474
You know,
the first time you came to the club.

195
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:38,188
That day…

196
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,400
I was feeling so miserable.

197
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,987
I thought about just dying.

198
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,409
But then I saw you on stage.

199
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,537
You were singing a song
no one was hearing…

200
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,666
with such a happy face.

201
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,926
I don't know why,
but when I heard you singing…

202
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,429
I thought I should live.

203
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:13,348
Thank you.

204
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:18,186
For staying here by my side
this very moment.

205
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,731
If I were alone…

206
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:25,735
I would've been so scared.

207
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:28,905
I'll stay by your side,
for the rest of my life.

208
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:37,997
Lee Yeon gave it.

209
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,548
I've dreamt of this moment so many times.

210
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,009
But why today?

211
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,512
I…

212
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,433
I was perverse from birth.

213
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:00,812
I used to stumble
at the pettiest misfortunes.

214
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,105
All my life…

215
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,860
I lived running from my past.

216
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:18,037
But don't intend to stumble
or run anymore.

217
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:20,999
Because I have you.

218
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,507
Yeo-hee, what's wrong?

219
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:32,635
I'm cold.

220
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,474
You're burning up!

221
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,278
What should I do, Yeon?

222
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:02,165
Smile a little.

223
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,500
Don't touch me.

224
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:09,506
Until our wedding,

225
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,717
I'll save your dignity.

226
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,765
-I'll get off here.
-You aren't going home, ma'am?

227
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:20,475
I'd like to walk.

228
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:21,643
Let her off.

229
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,610
Why is Yeo-hee running so late?

230
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,530
I hope nothing's happened to her.

231
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:35,448
No way.

232
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,535
Lord Lee Yeon and Lee Rang are
at the hotel too.

233
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,798
Eun-ho!

234
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:12,318
-Eun-ho.
-Ma'am! What are you doing here?

235
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:14,779
Who was that man just now?

236
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:19,367
-Ryuhei Kato, the Chief Commissioner.
-Your brother-in-law?

237
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,537
Yeah, but he's about to become my husband.

238
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,997
Now what's that about?

239
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,708
They want me to marry that man.

240
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,626
Eun-ho.

241
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,421
You, listen to me carefully.

242
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:35,466
That man…

243
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,511
isn't human.

244
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:44,934
What do you mean
the Chief Commissioner isn't human?

245
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,269
I saw him.

246
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:48,855
With my own eyes.

247
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,482
-Lord Lee Yeon!
-Don't come!

248
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,738
If he's not human, what is he?

249
00:19:57,989 --> 00:19:59,824
I don't know his original form.

250
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:04,370
But Eun-ho, don't ever get close to him.

251
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:08,499
Could this be the secret my sister saw?

252
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:15,632
She knew.
That's why that bastard killed her.

253
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,593
Forget it, okay? You must forget.

254
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,971
-He's not someone you can deal with.
-Then what should I do?

255
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:27,101
Get married to the enemy of my sister
and my country,

256
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:28,728
and live deceiving myself?

257
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,069
What the hell did we fight for?

258
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,789
-This…
-What about this dynamite?

259
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,251
I will do it.

260
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:56,547
-Even if I must grab and die with him--
-Why would you, ma'am?

261
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:57,632
I…

262
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:01,803
I've lived much longer
than you can imagine.

263
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:05,515
I suffered all kinds
of storms of life on this land.

264
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:08,226
But what can I do?

265
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:13,064
I still find Joseon to be beautiful.

266
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,192
And you fighting to protect it…

267
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:20,071
is seemingly beautiful to me.

268
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,121
You can't do it alone.

269
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:32,709
I have an idea.

270
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:44,178
I'll do it.

271
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:47,265
What?

272
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:50,059
I said, I'll get married.

273
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:54,272
-Here.
-The antidote?

274
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:58,234
-That girl gave it to you?
-Yeah.

275
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,486
-Why?
-In exchange for the ruler.

276
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,740
-What? Gosh.
-You yielded it to a Japanese demon?

277
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,285
Well, yeah.
I needed to save you guys first, no?

278
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:11,330
Do you think it's really an antidote?

279
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:13,750
I wouldn't know.

280
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,252
What do you think it is?

281
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,629
I say it's an antidote.

282
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,968
Don't eat it.

283
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:29,849
-You wouldn't save us. I don't trust you.
-Same here.

284
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:33,311
At the very least,
don't gamble with Hong-joo's life.

285
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,481
If we're gambling.

286
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:40,151
-Hey!
-This would be one, right?

287
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,445
-Yeon!
-Goodness.

288
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:45,907
If I don't wake up, it's poison.

289
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,533
Crazy fool.

290
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:48,993
What do we do?

291
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,162
Yeon.

292
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:55,958
Oh, shit.

293
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,638
Let's go, let's go!

294
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:12,058
Hey, hey, I saved you. I did!

295
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:20,441
I saved you this time! I did!

296
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:22,318
Gosh, you idiot!

297
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:25,905
You ran over to us earlier, like, all--

298
00:23:27,532 --> 00:23:29,492
It was super cool, right?

299
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:32,537
I just happened upon you two, that's all.

300
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:34,455
Don't get the wrong idea.

301
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:36,541
Way to ruin a good compliment.

302
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:38,501
We each serve a different boss.

303
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:41,754
If they become enemies,
we have no choice but to fight.

304
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:43,506
Say that when that actually happens.

305
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:46,676
Now, we're one big family of roomies.

306
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,177
Me, Jae-yoo, and…

307
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,556
Hey, what's your name?

308
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,644
Well, just call me whatever.
I'm fine with "hey" or "underboss."

309
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:59,021
-You don't have a name?
-Just tell us.

310
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,316
-I don't want to say.
-You serious?

311
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,444
Why not? We survived death together, no?

312
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,241
-Lee M-- Yeon.
-A what? "Yeon"?

313
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,245
-Wh--
-Lee! Mi-yeon!

314
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,043
Well, you have a pretty name
for a bandit gang member.

315
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:23,796
Hey! Boss gave me that name.

316
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,508
"Lee" after boss' surname.
"Mi" for rice. "Yeon" for relationships.

317
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:30,428
It means to eat rice heartily
and live a long life. Geez!

318
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:33,264
-All right, Mi-yeon.
-Mi-yeon, paw!

319
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:37,560
Mi-yeon or Lee Yeon: potato potahto!
And Hong-joo is even tackier, you--

320
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,353
-But Lord Lee Rang--
-Wait!

321
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:42,773
-You think boss and his missus is safe?
-Oh, right!

322
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:45,359
Lord Lee Yeon will kill me
if something happens to him!

323
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:50,156
Yeon…

324
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:51,824
Yeon!

325
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:55,786
Moo-yeong, what do we do?

326
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:56,954
Yeon is--

327
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:01,250
Hey! Why, that's nothing to joke about!

328
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:06,172
Sorry. This was an antidote after all.

329
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:11,469
-Moo-yeong, let's hurry and take it.
-Oh, no.

330
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:14,597
Not for free.

331
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:17,308
What do you mean?

332
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:18,684
What are they like?

333
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:22,271
Aside from the fox,
the others are weak from drinking poison.

334
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:25,024
-Is that so?
-But I gave him the antidote.

335
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:30,488
-Why, you crazy--
-Yuki always has a reason.

336
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:32,114
What reason, what?

337
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:34,992
Ta-da!

338
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:38,955
I exchanged the antidote for this.

339
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:42,416
Wow!

340
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:45,753
It's the real deal!

341
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:49,340
It's really it!

342
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:54,470
-What are they plotting?
-Guess they need an ally.

343
00:25:56,681 --> 00:25:59,058
And the other two? How were they?

344
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,019
I fought the female mountain god.

345
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,772
She was pretty tough, despite the poison.

346
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:07,900
Yet you still gave them the antidote?

347
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:10,945
Well, they don't know
what you can do, Nyudo.

348
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:14,573
More excellent bodies the better.

349
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:18,202
You've got a point.

350
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:20,538
Hold on to this, Yuki.

351
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:29,755
Give me the antidote.

352
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,759
-On one condition.
-A condition?

353
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:37,638
You two made it this far
for my treasures, huh?

354
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:41,559
But we have a mutual enemy now.

355
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,228
The mercenaries.

356
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:50,109
I'll give you the antidote
and you catch them with me.

357
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:53,279
-That's my condition.
-Geez. I'm all in.

358
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:02,204
Cheon Moo-yeong.

359
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,334
I don't need your help.

360
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:10,463
You think I'm doing this
because you're so adorable?

361
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:13,299
Even if we end each other,
we must get out first, no?

362
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:17,720
And one of the treasures
you're so obsessed with is in their hands.

363
00:27:20,181 --> 00:27:21,432
Swallow your ego and take it.

364
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:25,936
Mercenaries or not, if I were Yeon,
I'd have left you to die.

365
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,813
You're red-white mask.

366
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,525
Why would you try to save me too?

367
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:40,117
I need your talents.

368
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,203
The girl we saw earlier.

369
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:46,332
She's a demon who controls snow and ice.
You control fire.

370
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:00,971
And what if the mountain gods chip in?

371
00:28:01,055 --> 00:28:04,016
Four Japanese demons
and two mountain gods, it's six to one.

372
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:07,353
That's the real goal of this operation.

373
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:13,067
But what if Hong-joo
and Moo-yeong sides with us?

374
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:18,864
What if this becomes a battle between
the mercenaries and the mountain gods?

375
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,964
How many wishes do I have left?

376
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,050
Wishes?

377
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,845
I still have some left, right?

378
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:45,307
This is my last wish.

379
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,643
Get out of this room.

380
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,272
And stay as far away as you can.

381
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:54,733
No.

382
00:28:56,444 --> 00:28:58,154
Then promise me one thing.

383
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:01,615
If I change…

384
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,035
Kill me with your own hands.

385
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:11,876
No.

386
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:14,545
I'll die with you.

387
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:22,344
Foxes only love one woman
until the day they die.

388
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:29,852
You know, I really liked Gyeongseong.

389
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,023
The lights at the club.

390
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:37,318
The gorgeous stage costumes.

391
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:42,031
The jewels at our boutique.

392
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,619
It was filled with sparkles everywhere.

393
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,332
But what shined the brightest
in Gyeongseong was…

394
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:57,963
It was you, Lee Rang.

395
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:18,400
Yeo-hee. Yeo-hee!

396
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:23,197
She's still breathing but-- No, don't die!

397
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,824
Yeo-hee, wake up. Wake up!

398
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:27,159
Lord Lee Rang.

399
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,745
-Boss.
-Lord Lee Rang.

400
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:36,252
Honey, I cooked some jeon for you!

401
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,925
My goodness!
Don't drink on an empty stomach!

402
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:53,143
I find your unconditional kindness
quite frightening at times.

403
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:54,228
I'm frightening?

404
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:59,567
I wonder how a kind person like you
can endure living with me.

405
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:02,319
I'm proud of myself too.

406
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:07,992
I still find you amazing.

407
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,287
If not you, who else could endure it?

408
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:15,332
Being the owner of the Stream of the Dead.
A job that is heavy as hell.

409
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,879
An owner in name only.

410
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,716
I'm more like a powerless warden.

411
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:26,760
Neither allowed to interfere
in the human world,

412
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:28,804
nor completely neglect it.

413
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:32,641
I can't fight nor protect anyone.

414
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:34,935
But you raised those kids instead.

415
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,772
Though Moo-yeong got a bit crooked
in the very end.

416
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,943
They were all good mountain gods.

417
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:45,321
And you were a good teacher.

418
00:31:47,448 --> 00:31:50,993
A good teacher, you say?

419
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:56,999
That's why I believe they'll make the
right choice in the end. They will win.

420
00:32:01,337 --> 00:32:02,338
Am I drunk?

421
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,633
You look handsome for some reason.

422
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:08,093
Really? Have another drink.

423
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,972
We're out of drinks.
I'll go get some more.

424
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:14,892
-Honey.
-Yes?

425
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:16,769
Want to go to the theater tomorrow?

426
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:20,481
-To the theater? You will?
-Yeah.

427
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:22,316
Yeon once told me this.

428
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:26,320
To go out and see the world
instead of just being pent-up in here.

429
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:30,449
Well, I'd love to! I'll be right back.

430
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:40,167
I wonder if the King of Five Paths
will come to the theater.

431
00:32:42,503 --> 00:32:49,009
I must find out what's unfolding
around the stone and ruler.

432
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:52,096
This guy knows how to cure her?

433
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:54,473
Hurry and tell him, Mr. Jindo.

434
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:59,061
Tell me!
Or else, you're coming with me to die!

435
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:02,731
An innocent mermaid can't be sacrificed
in a fight between our bosses, no?

436
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:04,400
You don't want that either, huh?

437
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:07,903
I just happened to hear something.

438
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,321
A Yacha?

439
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:14,493
What if we get unlucky
and one of our guys get hurt?

440
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:18,038
Don't leave the room if possible.
But if someone gets bitten…

441
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:21,083
Give them some brewed iris pistil.

442
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:25,212
A pistil of an iris. Will that work?

443
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:28,507
Moo-yeong created the demon,
so it should work.

444
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,218
How do we get that at this hour?
Even if we go outside--

445
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:33,095
We must save her before it's too late.

446
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:36,265
-You're sleeping?
-It's in the hotel restaurant!

447
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:39,017
Bonjour, mademoiselle. Bonjour, monsieur.

448
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:45,774
It's a French restaurant.
I saw saffron in the cupboard.

449
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:48,110
-Sharp?
-It's a type of spice in the iris family.

450
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:50,362
I'll go get it.

451
00:33:50,446 --> 00:33:53,115
You're going there
when it's full of Yachas now?

452
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,908
-I must go.
-Take me with you then!

453
00:33:54,992 --> 00:33:56,869
-I'll go too.
-Hey!

454
00:33:57,453 --> 00:34:00,706
-Why should I go there?
-We're a family.

455
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:05,335
I'm sorry, but my life isn't mine.

456
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:08,005
-It's Madame Ryu's.
-We have no time. Let's go.

457
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:09,965
Take care of Mrs. Boss.

458
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:15,345
Please hang in there until I get back.

459
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:53,509
They're having a damn feast, huh?

460
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:55,844
How do we get past them?

461
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:04,978
Their movements are slower than before.

462
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:07,898
Where do you think you're going?

463
00:35:09,525 --> 00:35:10,901
Lord Lee Rang!

464
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:39,388
They can't even see that?

465
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:01,994
They can't see us without the light.
They only react to noises.

466
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,204
So we approach them in silence?

467
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:07,291
No. We'll use that to our advantage.

468
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,752
Shin-ju, get the iris from the restaurant.

469
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,755
We'll lure them to one side
in the loudest way possible.

470
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,593
Should I just scream with all my might?

471
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:20,053
-If you do, Shin-ju will be in danger.
-Then?

472
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,231
The record player.

473
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:38,614
Let's move it over there and lure them.

474
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:42,159
At the sound of music,
they'll swarm there.

475
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:43,994
Let's go.

476
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:46,914
So what's the plan now?

477
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:53,003
Look here. Out of the four mercenaries,
the poison bender is dead.

478
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:54,254
So he's a goner.

479
00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:57,049
Now it's the three of them
and the three of us.

480
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:58,550
What are their powers?

481
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:02,971
The first one is Yuki-onna, the snow lady.

482
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:04,598
You guys saw her earlier.

483
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:10,646
The second guy's name was,
Gamma-ray. Something with "gamma."

484
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:13,982
-Oogama, that's what she said.
-She's right. It's Oogama.

485
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:15,692
And what's that?

486
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:18,570
A centuries-old Japanese toad demon.

487
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:20,197
I've read about it.

488
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,907
He's an airhead who's just strong.

489
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,784
OOGAMA: A GIANT TOAD DEMON
FROM JAPANESE FABLES

490
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:25,035
-I'll take care of him.
-Sure.

491
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:30,332
The problem is the third guy.
Gosh, I don't know his name or power.

492
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:32,709
And he seems to be the boss.

493
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,213
Oh, well. I'll deal with this one.

494
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:37,798
How will you catch all three?

495
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:43,053
Well, I gave them the golden ruler,
so they should come for the stone now.

496
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:44,805
I'll be the bait.

497
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:48,642
Is that necessary?
They must be looking for you too.

498
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:50,852
-They'll come find you.
-Gosh.

499
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:53,855
I don't have time
to sit back and wait, you hear?

500
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:57,693
Because some prick let
a Yacha loose at the hotel.

501
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:03,031
-Damn it. Then let's all go together.
-It's fine.

502
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:06,910
Even if you took the antidote,
it'll take some time to take effect.

503
00:38:06,994 --> 00:38:09,871
I'll lure them in.
In the meantime, you guys recover.

504
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:15,836
-Yeon.
-Yeah?

505
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:21,049
-Just in case.
-Wh-- Goodness.

506
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:22,426
Really?

507
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:28,515
Hey, why give me a gun
when they aren't even humans, huh?

508
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:30,434
If things go awry, you must call me.

509
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:34,062
I'm not a kid. Here, take this back.

510
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:35,605
-Yeon!
-Yeah?

511
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:37,065
Just one last thing.

512
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:42,154
Yeah, all right. I'll be back.

513
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,869
Excuse me!

514
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,749
-Please take me with you.
-Get lost.

515
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:39,211
You beat me up earlier, remember?

516
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:40,462
-You not sorry?
-Get lost.

517
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:43,048
Don't be like that.
Let's make it out together.

518
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:44,758
-I'll help out.
-Don't touch it!

519
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:46,343
Shush!

520
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:53,850
I'll kill you.

521
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:56,728
I'll be invisible.

522
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:29,094
President?

523
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:33,849
President, it's me.

524
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:49,197
Hurry, hurry!

525
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:50,740
Don't come here, you!

526
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:58,623
Boss, quick! Turn it on!

527
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:04,546
I'm not the kind
to die in a place like this!

528
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,299
Stop pushing!

529
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:20,562
Geez.

530
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:28,904
Where the hell are they? Damn it!

531
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:35,327
What's this smell?

532
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:38,663
I definitely know this smell.

533
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:42,751
What's this now?

534
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:47,797
Who are you?

535
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,844
Please help me.

536
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:57,933
-I've seen this old man somewhere.
-At Myoyeongak, sir.

537
00:42:02,646 --> 00:42:05,440
Oh, right! I remember you.

538
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:07,984
You're an indigenous god?

539
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:13,531
Yes, sir. But where on earth are we?

540
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:17,494
-Why am I suddenly in the woods?
-Why don't you tell me?

541
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:20,580
-How did you get in here?
-Well.

542
00:42:20,664 --> 00:42:24,167
I was at the hotel until a while ago.

543
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:28,338
But monsters started chasing me,
so I jumped into an open room and…

544
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:31,299
Goodness, how pathetic.

545
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:34,094
This place is more dangerous.

546
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:35,887
It's teeming with Japanese demons.

547
00:42:37,931 --> 00:42:40,308
Sir! Could you please take me with you?

548
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:44,479
I sprained my ankle
while running from the monsters.

549
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:47,524
Gosh, I'm too busy
for you to bother me like this.

550
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:50,402
Geez. Get on.

551
00:42:53,697 --> 00:42:56,491
-Thank you, sir.
-Geez.

552
00:43:11,131 --> 00:43:12,382
How?

553
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:14,718
The poison bender from earlier
smelled just like you.

554
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:16,845
A strangely unpleasant sweet smell.

555
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:26,229
This?

556
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:29,107
Caramels? You're one of the mercenaries.

557
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:33,069
-You're quite fast.
-Are you the boss?

558
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:35,989
My name is Nyudo.

559
00:43:37,574 --> 00:43:39,492
Onyudo.

560
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:44,748
-I like you.
-You're not my type.

561
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,283
What?

562
00:44:22,494 --> 00:44:23,578
Why is my body there?

563
00:44:25,372 --> 00:44:26,915
You see, Onyudo has a meaning.

564
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:29,667
It means, I'm a body-switching demon.

565
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:31,711
ONYUDO: A BODY-SWITCHING DEMON
FROM JAPANESE FABLES

566
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:36,091
What do you think?
Do you like my new body?

567
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,344
My goodness.

568
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:42,972
Give me back my nice body.

569
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:46,768
Oh, dear.

570
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:51,189
You just had to stab me
with a sword, didn't you?

571
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,320
You think you're above us, huh?

572
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:03,993
Being a mountain god of Joseon
means nothing.

573
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:13,628
By the way, where is the treasure?

574
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:20,301
I'll never give it to you pricks.

575
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:23,555
What? Darn it.

576
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:26,641
Where did you put the treasure?

577
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:27,892
It's not there?

578
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:35,525
It can't be…

579
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:38,945
Hey, stop it.
It's just going to weigh me down.

580
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:42,866
Shit.

581
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:49,497
-The treasure's not with me.
-Is that so?

582
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:53,543
Guess the others have it then.

583
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:57,422
No!

584
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:01,718
You can't.

585
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:13,980
Boss, hurry and turn it on!

586
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:38,171
Where did that bastard go?

587
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:50,308
I will kill you with my own hands.

588
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:57,857
I wonder if Hong-joo
and Moo-yeong are safe.

589
00:46:58,525 --> 00:47:00,318
What if he pretends to be me?

590
00:47:13,623 --> 00:47:16,334
My treasure has been stolen,
and my body is in this state.

591
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,628
I don't even know if Rang is alive.

592
00:47:19,212 --> 00:47:22,966
Where did everything start to fall apart?

593
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:33,601
Is she still alive?

594
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:37,480
I can hear her breathing.

595
00:47:37,564 --> 00:47:40,358
What if she turns into a monster
and tries to eat us?

596
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:45,905
-It's fine, as long as she's breathing.
-This is getting me so anxious.

597
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:49,450
-What about Jae-yoo?
-He went to find Madame Ryu.

598
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:52,912
I want to leave!
I don't want to die in a place like this!

599
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,040
-Orchid!
-Just leave her be.

600
00:47:56,124 --> 00:47:57,458
He said not to go out.

601
00:47:57,542 --> 00:48:00,253
Move, you little brat.
Staying in here is terrifying!

602
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:02,338
You don't know what's out there!

603
00:48:06,175 --> 00:48:08,928
-Madame Ryu might be back.
-I'm not letting you out.

604
00:48:09,429 --> 00:48:10,597
Have you lost your mind?

605
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,474
Did you forget Lord Lee Yeon
and Lord Lee Rang saving you?

606
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:15,435
I owe them my life too!

607
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,189
-So annoying.
-Don't get too upset.

608
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,610
If she stops breathing, I'll finish her.

609
00:48:28,698 --> 00:48:31,034
We can't die in vain at a place like this.

610
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:45,465
Open the door!

611
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,998
Close it!

612
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:40,228
Saffron, saffron…

613
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:43,398
Saffron.

614
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:46,317
Okay, got it.

615
00:50:07,797 --> 00:50:10,258
I don't want to die! I don't want to die!

616
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:12,051
Hey, you prick! Get it together.

617
00:50:12,135 --> 00:50:14,053
Hey, get it together! Calm down!

618
00:50:14,137 --> 00:50:16,222
I'm sorry, but I'm going!

619
00:50:17,974 --> 00:50:19,100
No!

620
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,196
Go. Go!

621
00:51:07,774 --> 00:51:11,152
Do you think we'll get out of here?

622
00:51:13,863 --> 00:51:15,114
Why would you say that?

623
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:17,116
No reason.

624
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,535
Strangely, I have a bad feeling.

625
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:22,413
Just like the morning
of the mountain god exam.

626
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:28,294
-But you passed the exam.
-Instead, I lost what I loved the most.

627
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:31,923
You guys.

628
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:52,151
You didn't lose me.

629
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:55,029
I've only had eyes for you.

630
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:59,492
Hong-joo, you only had eyes for Lee Yeon.

631
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,579
But I only had eyes for you all along.

632
00:52:05,248 --> 00:52:06,332
I wanted you.

633
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,335
Though I knew you wouldn't be mine.

634
00:52:16,843 --> 00:52:19,637
Why do first loves always go wrong?

635
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:24,141
Because it's your first love?

636
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:31,274
What would you do if your first love
took the treasure for herself?

637
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:35,027
Well, that's a difficult one.

638
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:38,489
Better than losing it to Yeon.

639
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:46,664
-Guys.
-Yeon!

640
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:50,835
Why are you alone?
What about the mercenaries?

641
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:53,129
Well, I was ambushed by them.

642
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:55,548
Don't tell me you ran away.

643
00:52:57,049 --> 00:52:59,719
-Instead, I found their hideout.
-Where?

644
00:53:01,888 --> 00:53:06,475
But how are you guys feeling?
Has the poison been fully neutralized?

645
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:10,730
The bleeding has stopped,
but we're not fully recovered yet.

646
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:14,483
Good. I'll lure them to our hideout.

647
00:53:14,567 --> 00:53:17,278
Well, let's hurry. Now is our chance.

648
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:19,280
Let's go.

649
00:53:24,744 --> 00:53:25,828
Nyudo!

650
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:27,622
Nyudo!

651
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:29,498
It's the mercenaries.

652
00:53:29,582 --> 00:53:30,583
Nyudo!

653
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:33,210
Nyudo!

654
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:36,756
Nyudo!

655
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:41,761
If I attract their attention now,
I'll be dead meat.

656
00:53:43,012 --> 00:53:44,639
I can't fight them with this body.

657
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:46,140
Nyudo!

658
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:49,727
Hey, Nyudo isn't here.

659
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:50,811
How strange.

660
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:56,192
-I heard footsteps nearby.
-Maybe it's one of the mountain gods.

661
00:53:57,318 --> 00:53:58,819
I hope it's the nine-tailed fox.

662
00:54:04,325 --> 00:54:05,785
-Here.
-Please!

663
00:54:06,535 --> 00:54:07,703
Please go elsewhere!

664
00:54:09,705 --> 00:54:11,040
I don't think he's here.

665
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:13,542
Let's go.

666
00:54:21,133 --> 00:54:22,218
Thank goodness.

667
00:54:24,387 --> 00:54:25,388
Hold on.

668
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:29,934
Perhaps, this may be an opportunity.

669
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:33,437
They don't know our bodies switched.

670
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:36,399
But if they find out…

671
00:54:39,068 --> 00:54:40,069
Over here!

672
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:43,906
-Nyudo!
-Nyudo!

673
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:47,535
Hey, where were you?

674
00:54:58,629 --> 00:54:59,672
What's with you?

675
00:55:10,683 --> 00:55:13,060
Charge forward!

676
00:55:39,295 --> 00:55:40,463
Boss!

677
00:55:41,464 --> 00:55:42,757
Hang on to me!

678
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:46,343
-Lord Lee Rang.
-Shin-ju, you got it?

679
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:50,014
-Let's go.
-He was bitten!

680
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:53,225
-Let's go together.
-You son of a--

681
00:55:53,309 --> 00:55:54,810
I didn't mean to put you at risk!

682
00:55:55,478 --> 00:55:57,063
-Why you--
-We save the living!

683
00:55:57,146 --> 00:55:58,272
Yes, the living.

684
00:55:58,355 --> 00:55:59,648
What should we do, Boss?

685
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:06,781
-Come here, you bastard!
-Let's go together!

686
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:08,032
Just die!

687
00:56:16,624 --> 00:56:18,709
Help me, help me!

688
00:56:33,182 --> 00:56:35,518
-What are you doing?
-We've waited long enough.

689
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:37,353
-Lord Lee Rang isn't coming!
-He will!

690
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:38,896
What happens if he doesn't?

691
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:42,191
Madame always said to live or to die
is our own decision to make.

692
00:56:42,274 --> 00:56:44,485
-I want to live.
-Let's wait a little longer.

693
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:46,445
-Move!
-Stop it!

694
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:49,240
-Orchid!
-You stay out of this.

695
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:52,451
I'm sorry.

696
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:01,127
What's with you?

697
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,839
I asked you a question.

698
00:57:07,299 --> 00:57:08,425
What do you mean?

699
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:11,178
What's with the injury?

700
00:57:16,142 --> 00:57:17,476
The nine-tailed fox got to me.

701
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:24,650
Idiot. Nyudo's an idiot.

702
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:27,862
And after all that bragging.

703
00:57:28,696 --> 00:57:29,947
Shut up!

704
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:33,701
By the way, are you really Nyudo?

705
00:57:36,745 --> 00:57:40,583
-What?
-You can just switch bodies with the fox.

706
00:57:43,002 --> 00:57:44,170
Don't tell me.

707
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:47,214
It's been switched.

708
00:57:48,883 --> 00:57:54,305
Gosh. Without Ushiuchibo,
we can't tell his original form.

709
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:55,389
You're right.

710
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:01,729
If you really are Nyudo,
why didn't you switch bodies with him?

711
00:58:15,618 --> 00:58:19,205
That bastard
knows more about us than we thought.

712
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:22,958
-He even knows about my power.
-How did he know?

713
00:58:23,042 --> 00:58:24,043
That reminds me.

714
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:26,754
He did know about me too.

715
00:58:28,964 --> 00:58:31,133
Shouldn't we tell boss?

716
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:36,013
Boss?

717
00:58:36,597 --> 00:58:39,058
Where's the boss? You should know.

718
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:42,311
The bastard who stole my body
wasn't the boss?

719
00:58:43,938 --> 00:58:47,650
Shinigami Mercenaries
has five members, not four.

720
00:58:48,901 --> 00:58:50,402
Then where is--

721
00:58:53,072 --> 00:58:54,281
Don't tell me.

722
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,498
And the mercenaries?

723
00:59:03,374 --> 00:59:04,917
Still no word from them?

724
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:08,003
Their boss is at the Bando Hotel.

725
00:59:09,964 --> 00:59:11,006
Satori is?

726
00:59:11,674 --> 00:59:14,635
Yes. Now that Satori has joined the game,

727
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:17,972
for people and demons alike, that hotel…

728
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:20,808
will be a slaughterhouse.

729
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:56,969
Hurry up.

730
01:00:06,437 --> 01:00:11,150
TALE OF THE NINE TAILED

731
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:37,301
One, two, three.

732
01:00:37,384 --> 01:00:41,263
From now on,
you can't take one step out of this room.

733
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:42,931
Until you die.

734
01:00:43,432 --> 01:00:44,433
Hong-joo!

735
01:00:44,516 --> 01:00:45,768
How disappointing.

736
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:50,314
What is the reason Moo-yeong…

737
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:52,441
-Cheon Moo-yeong!
-…came to this era?

738
01:00:52,524 --> 01:00:54,193
Don't you have an idea?

739
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:57,321
He's trying to awaken something
with the golden ruler.

740
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:59,865
It can't be! He can't wake that up!

741
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:04,995
Don't even think of having hope.

742
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:06,246
Don't die, Moo-yeong.

743
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:09,750
Please have my back, so I can fight.

744
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:13,545
