00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:56,974
TALE OF THE NINE TAILED

2
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:00,436
EPISODE 2

3
00:01:03,606 --> 00:01:06,776
-And what's next for you?
-First time in Joseon?

4
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:07,985
SECOND CLASS

5
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,737
-How's your wife?
-I'm hungry.

6
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:11,530
Get out of my way.

7
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,366
Why, you little--

8
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:16,368
Buzz off.

9
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,045
FIRST CLASS

10
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:28,005
Gosh, it's packed.

11
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:29,924
Oh, over here.

12
00:01:50,236 --> 00:01:51,946
What are you looking at?

13
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,658
Hey, didn't you learn any manners?

14
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:00,412
Cigarettes?

15
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:04,875
Hey, how dare you smoke in here!
Put it out right now!

16
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:07,878
There's a kid and a dog here.
You wanna fight me?

17
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:10,130
Didn't you learn any manners?

18
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,049
Hurry up! Put it out!

19
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:18,597
Sorry for shouting.

20
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:21,559
VIP ROOM

21
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,562
Oh, goodness. I almost missed the train.

22
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:33,362
It's an important day,
so please decorate it nice.

23
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:34,572
Yes, ma'am.

24
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:38,284
I need to look pretty too.

25
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:41,036
I'm so nervous.

26
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:45,207
Everything look good?

27
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,016
CARGO COMPARTMENT

28
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,268
Where on earth is Lord Lee Yeon?

29
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,062
Did he leave me in this era
and return home alone?

30
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:15,779
Excuse me. Where is this train headed?

31
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:16,947
Manchuria.

32
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,075
Where in Manchuria?

33
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,036
Kamo Unit. Now, sit down!

34
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:30,628
Kamo Unit? I've heard of it somewhere…

35
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,588
Kwantung Army's
Epidemic Prevention department.

36
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,591
They are support troops
that supply water to the army.

37
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:38,010
Then it's not dangerous, right?

38
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,554
Thank goodness.

39
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,516
Manshu Detachment 731?

40
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,775
You're so beautiful.

41
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,403
By any chance, are you a movie star?

42
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,490
I'll become one soon.

43
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:02,993
I'm participating in the
Miss Joseon Pageant held by Seonwoo Daily.

44
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:04,870
What's that?

45
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:08,666
It's where Joseon's most beautiful woman
will be chosen.

46
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,339
-Here.
-You eat it.

47
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:18,425
I know how much you like eggs.

48
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:26,058
THIS MORNING

49
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:30,521
So you're saying
that my future self sent you here?

50
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:36,610
You completed your mission,
but much later than your allotted time.

51
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:38,320
My brother was dying.

52
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:39,947
Isn't that your choice, after all?

53
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,283
"Should I go back
or stay here and save my brother?"

54
00:04:44,994 --> 00:04:46,620
Let me go. Please?

55
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:50,457
-I have someone waiting for me at home.
-Try opening it, then.

56
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:57,256
Is there no other way to go home?

57
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,424
Well…

58
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:03,387
there's always a way, but…

59
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,724
-What is it?
-Go run an errand.

60
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:08,767
Then I'll tell you.

61
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:16,525
The Legendary Pipe is on the train
that left Busan this morning.

62
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:23,574
The Legendary Pipe fell
into the hands of the Japanese?

63
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:26,201
The old hag even sealed the item.

64
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:27,661
And they broke the seal?

65
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:29,830
So they're no ordinary guys.

66
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:34,168
If you play the pipe well enough,
you can even blow up an entire mountain.

67
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,130
We have an hour left to Gyeongseong.

68
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,966
Let's find it
before they get off and scatter.

69
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:44,094
So it's in this very compartment.

70
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,097
But we don't know who has it?

71
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:53,062
There are seven Japanese in first class.

72
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:56,190
We'll have to torture them one by one.

73
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,276
-Wait for it.
-What?

74
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:03,322
An overpass is coming up soon.

75
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,532
So, no one came back alive?

76
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:07,576
From Unit 731?

77
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:13,082
Please help me. I have to get out of here.

78
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:16,752
You all wish to risk your lives
by listening to some guy's story?

79
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:17,878
I want to go.

80
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,839
My mom and dad are sick.

81
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:22,174
I want to go too.

82
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,384
I don't want to die in Manchuria.

83
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:26,220
If I die, I'll die in my hometown.

84
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,388
Have you gone nuts?
You'll get us all killed.

85
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,434
I just need that door to open.

86
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,144
Just the door.

87
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,193
All right. Let's go!

88
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,445
Go!

89
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:51,120
We're almost at the overpass.

90
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:16,895
Hey, take all you can!

91
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,940
What's this? Hey, where are you touching?

92
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,525
What the-- Hey, you!

93
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:22,609
Help!

94
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,403
Hey, get your hands off me!

95
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,363
He's disappeared.

96
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,992
Fire! There's a fire!

97
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,410
Fire, fire!

98
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,120
What are you doing, you punks?

99
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,998
-It's a fire! It's a fire!
-Move aside!

100
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:39,585
Now!

101
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:51,180
-Hey, hey. What's going on?
-What?

102
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:53,307
Thieves! Thieves!

103
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,474
-What?
-There's a thief!

104
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:56,435
Hey, someone touched me here and--

105
00:07:56,518 --> 00:08:00,105
-Here too!
-Oh, dear. My Bok-sil! Bok-sil!

106
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:01,273
My bag's gone!

107
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:02,941
My jewelry!

108
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,110
Hey, someone touched me here too.

109
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:06,320
And over here!

110
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,030
Anyway, whoever it is--

111
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:12,034
I've lost my diamond ring!

112
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:15,329
Hey, your guys did this?

113
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,040
You said you needed the Legendary Pipe.

114
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,084
It's your reward for saving my life.

115
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,504
A fox always repays kindness, right?

116
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,340
Sure.

117
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:38,268
-What are you looking at? Get out!
-Get the hell out!

118
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:40,979
What is your deal, woman?

119
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,691
Me?

120
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:48,946
-A pretty girl who is good at fighting.
-I see.

121
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,454
Oh, don't bother helping me.
I'm just warming up here.

122
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:02,834
How fun.

123
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:04,586
Next, you.

124
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,756
First class was robbed.

125
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,549
-What?
-There's a riot at the back!

126
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,343
Block the exits!

127
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,763
From here on, no one gets off this train.
You guys, to the front.

128
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:15,847
Yes, sir.

129
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,267
-And you guys follow me.
-Yes, sir!

130
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:23,897
Come on. Let's go!

131
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,152
Grab my hand!

132
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,833
I'm going to be accused
of being a thief now.

133
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:46,920
-Pick something.
-Why steal the dog?

134
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:49,089
And why this stinky thing?

135
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:52,759
Once my guys start stealing,
they take every last thing, you know.

136
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:54,428
You say that like you're proud.

137
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,973
Sorry, I'm sorry.

138
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,641
Damn it.

139
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,019
Gosh.

140
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,067
Hey, let's go!

141
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:10,152
Let's go!

142
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,138
Did you just hit me?

143
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:40,849
I'm supposed to look my prettiest today.

144
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:43,226
The item belongs to the Empire of Japan.

145
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,604
No, it doesn't. It belongs to Hong-ju.

146
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,714
Not bad. You're not human, huh?

147
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:15,717
Demons posing as humans
aren't only in Joseon, you know.

148
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:18,178
Bring it on! Who the hell are you?

149
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,143
It's mine!

150
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,111
Shit!

151
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:39,616
Damn it.

152
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:42,452
Hey, the Legendary Pipe isn't here.

153
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,413
Boss! Boss!

154
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,207
The pipe-- It got stolen from me.

155
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,625
-By whom?
-By whom?

156
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,960
By me.

157
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:54,381
VIP ROOM

158
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,057
Welcome, sir!

159
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:09,938
What's all this?

160
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,531
Long time no see, fox.

161
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:22,951
RYU HONG-JU:
FORMER MOUNTAIN GOD OF THE WEST

162
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,661
AKA KING OF THE WILD,
THE EAGLE-OWL

163
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,955
No way. It can't be.

164
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,127
Ryu Hong-ju, what are you doing here?

165
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,211
I missed you.

166
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,714
Still haven't forgotten that human girl?

167
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:40,927
-Get your hand off my thigh.
-Sure. You're still modest.

168
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,888
Is she an ally or an enemy?

169
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,557
She's your future sister-in-law.

170
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:47,392
Sister-in-law?

171
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:49,978
Stop playing hard to get
and come live with me now.

172
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,109
I heard you're looking for this.

173
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,323
Yes, Hong-ju.
I'll be taking this appreciatively.

174
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,659
-But we can't get married.
-Why not?

175
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:08,497
You see, marriage requires
the consent of both parties, but I--

176
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,626
How dare you reject me?

177
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,586
I bought a dress just for today.

178
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,630
I even got my hair done.

179
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,591
And flowers-- I got all these flowers too.

180
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:24,012
But you humiliated me.

181
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,681
Rang, escape while you can.

182
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:28,808
Sure. You're on your own with this.

183
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,978
-Go get my wedding gift.
-Yes, ma'am.

184
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,857
And you, follow me.

185
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,834
Look! It's that guy over there.

186
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:55,961
That guy, that guy!

187
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:58,755
It's that guy! Grab every single one!

188
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,553
You shits must have a death wish.
Hurry, take care of 'em.

189
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,807
-Move it! Move!
-Lord Lee Yeon…

190
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:25,657
Who's the mastermind?

191
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,119
-Please spare--
-Tell me, you bastard!

192
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,039
No.

193
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,801
It's been a while.

194
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,013
The Jirisan crazy fox is back.

195
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,807
Why won't you give it to me?

196
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:53,560
Give you what?

197
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:56,313
You can give it to me once, right?

198
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,232
This body's taken.

199
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:02,360
And that woman is dead. Give it!

200
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:06,156
Hong-ju!

201
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:10,994
Let's be rational here, okay?

202
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,955
You were a former mountain god, after all.

203
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,292
Now, should you be
incurring damages upon humans?

204
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,003
I shouldn't.

205
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,880
-That's right.
-I'll be rational too.

206
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:23,381
Okay. Go on, tell me.

207
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:25,050
You, be mine.

208
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,217
Goodness!

209
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,595
I thought we were done with that!

210
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,388
You're rejecting me twice in a day?

211
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,440
Gosh. Why can't you be rational? Geez!

212
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,861
What's this?

213
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,364
-Get out!
-Move it!

214
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:00,919
-And you are?
-I'm a native Jindo.

215
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,487
Shoot!

216
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,338
Boss! I'm all out!

217
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:57,892
Not the dog!

218
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,191
My goodness!

219
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:06,568
Geez, that's enough.

220
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,990
Hong-ju, wait! Hold on!

221
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,118
"Hold on," my foot.

222
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,247
Darn it!

223
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:03,416
Damn it.

224
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,297
-Well, I liked it.
-No, it's not like that.

225
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,341
Grab your sword.

226
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,678
What? You playing me again?

227
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,222
Oh, no-- No! Don't grab it!

228
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:18,306
Hey, hey--

229
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:45,166
Wait, wait!

230
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,628
Oh, no. Hey, hey!

231
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,856
Hey, Rang. Rang!

232
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,065
Help…

233
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:14,571
That little-- That ungrateful bastard.

234
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,030
-Bring it.
-Yes, ma'am.

235
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,873
Seriously?

236
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,212
Geez.

237
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:32,630
My goodness.

238
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,148
Bye!

239
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,279
The train stopped.

240
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:41,407
This is our chance. Let's go!

241
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:43,493
-Okay, let's go.
-Let's go.

242
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,286
Come on. Go!

243
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,466
Oh, gosh.

244
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:04,263
What is this? A horror movie?

245
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:08,518
Goodness!

246
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,192
Hey, need a ride?

247
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,778
Oh, that not-so-ungrateful bastard!

248
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:22,991
He's still cute.

249
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:25,827
Hurry up!

250
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:28,496
-Come!
-Hey! Hurry up!

251
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:43,761
Who was that? Did she just stop the train?

252
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:47,223
Yeah, she tops all four mountain gods
when it comes to strength.

253
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,058
Let's hope I never see her again.

254
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:50,184
Geez. Giddyap!

255
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:06,492
We'll meet again soon, Lee Yeon.

256
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,879
No need to worry about
the police incident yesterday.

257
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:19,922
All right.

258
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:21,257
It's been a while.

259
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,886
There you are, Brother-in-law.

260
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:25,970
Yes.

261
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:38,066
I heard you were taken
to the police station yesterday.

262
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:40,109
Our Ginko was?

263
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,906
They say I'm, like, a bombing suspect.

264
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:48,409
I don't believe this.
How dare they blame our daughter?

265
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:50,161
It's not Ginko.

266
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:54,540
The suspect has a gunshot wound
on their left shoulder.

267
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:03,424
Let me see your shoulder.

268
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,178
Honey!

269
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:18,022
See? There's no wound.

270
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:22,652
The wound disappeared.

271
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:24,570
How?

272
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:31,369
This country will never be independent.

273
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:35,414
If you get involved with those movements,
you know what'll happen, right?

274
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:37,667
I'll shoot you even if you're my child.

275
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:42,463
It seems I've caused a scene
so early in the morning.

276
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:45,091
Well, you were worried about Ginko, right?

277
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:46,217
Yes, ma'am.

278
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:02,150
Wait a minute.

279
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,112
Where in the world is Lord Lee Yeon?

280
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:08,197
I'm hungry.

281
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:24,088
Excuse me.

282
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:26,716
Well, if you don't mind…

283
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:30,678
Gosh, you must be starved.

284
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:33,556
Come, come here. Come join us.

285
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:37,185
Hey, here.

286
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:42,857
I guess people still have empathy
in this era.

287
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:51,240
If you don't mind me asking,
what do you all do?

288
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:55,828
Well, to put it simply,
we're a bunch of guys who dream

289
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:59,457
of an equal and just world,
without a gap between the rich and poor.

290
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:05,504
So they're beggars.

291
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:08,341
It's must be hard for them too, and yet…

292
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:10,259
Here. Drink up.

293
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:14,055
No, no.

294
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:15,848
You have to empty it first.

295
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,446
Think of this as philanthropy, okay?

296
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,116
Let's get started.

297
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,369
Here, take his shoes.

298
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:38,955
And the meat. Pack the meat.

299
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,332
Oh, look. Take that thing on his finger.

300
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:46,212
Nice, nice.

301
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:49,173
You bought a car?

302
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:52,343
Well, I saved up for years
and finally bought one.

303
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:56,180
-Hey, I hear you're Yeon from the future.
-Yeah.

304
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:59,600
-I was wondering--
-You won't get that divorce. Ever.

305
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:03,604
You won't. Never!

306
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:07,733
What do you mean, "Never"?

307
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:12,113
How do I get home?

308
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:16,200
The Gate of Time only opens once:
on the day of the lunar eclipse.

309
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:19,245
-And when's that?
-Twenty-nine days from now.

310
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:21,080
A month?

311
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,710
I really have to go home.
My wife is going to worry about me!

312
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,044
Don't worry.

313
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:30,047
Time flows differently here
than the future you're from.

314
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:34,093
Even if you stay here for a month,
it'll only be a few days there.

315
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:36,804
-Well, that's good news.
-What about the guardian stone?

316
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:41,309
-Here.
-Don't ever lose it.

317
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:43,102
Without it, you'll never go home.

318
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,603
But who's the red-white mask?

319
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:48,774
That guy stole this guardian stone
and almost had my brother killed.

320
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:51,861
That's what I'm concerned about.

321
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:55,323
Something is going on…

322
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:58,367
someplace my eyes can't see.

323
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:02,121
So there are things you can't see,
even with your thousand-mile eyes?

324
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,414
I'll catch him for you.

325
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:06,167
Give me some money, and a car too.
It's been a hassle.

326
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:21,557
What's with the coffin?

327
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:24,352
Did someone die?

328
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,021
No.

329
00:27:28,189 --> 00:27:29,690
I'm going to kill someone.

330
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,153
Who are you, Mu-yeong?

331
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:37,281
How did my wound disappear in two days?

332
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:41,827
I was a mountain god
who ruled the northern forest.

333
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:44,914
I see.

334
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,624
You're a funny guy.

335
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,251
Here.

336
00:27:49,794 --> 00:27:51,337
I've paid off my debt now.

337
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:53,881
You're right.

338
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:58,052
There's no more debt between us.

339
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:04,517
Would you like to lie down?

340
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:09,105
-Me?
-Help me measure the length.

341
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:15,486
Fine, since my rescuer insists.

342
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:34,088
It's a strange feeling.

343
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:36,882
-What kind of feeling?
-Well…

344
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:39,301
I feel like I should leave a will.

345
00:28:40,678 --> 00:28:43,431
Leave one, then.
As if this is your last moment.

346
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:47,268
I had a sister
who was a year older than me.

347
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:50,479
With a quisling for a father

348
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,274
and a snob for a mother…

349
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:57,153
She was the only one on my side.

350
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,531
But she killed herself.

351
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:03,534
After being married off
to the chief commissioner in my place.

352
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:07,329
I miss her.

353
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:13,794
I had an older brother too.

354
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:18,674
He always carried me on his back,
treating me like a baby.

355
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:22,052
I vaguely remember his back feeling warm.

356
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:25,890
-But I can't seem to remember his face.
-You're speaking in past tense?

357
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:32,104
He was killed
at the hands of his best friend.

358
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:33,898
Did you get revenge?

359
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:37,610
I will.

360
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:41,530
Until I take away everything
he ever cared for.

361
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:50,039
So we have the same goal.

362
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,895
Oh, my clothes!

363
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:15,606
Gosh! My wedding ring!

364
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,068
My limited-edition sneakers!

365
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:20,694
Shit!

366
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:33,374
No words can explain how high I feel!

367
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:41,674
HANGMYEONOK NOODLES

368
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:00,985
-What's this?
-I don't like eggs.

369
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:04,029
You're being picky at that age?
How pathetic.

370
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:10,828
What if the past changes?
Will the future change as well?

371
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,329
Like Rang coming back to life?

372
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:16,250
Whatever you do,
the reality you'll return to won't change.

373
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,794
You're just a traveler
passing through this era.

374
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,006
You exist, but you don't belong here.

375
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:25,259
So I only have a month to spend with Rang.

376
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:31,140
Stay with me for the next month.

377
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:38,480
-No, thanks.
-At least think before you talk.

378
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:40,190
Thinking won't change my answer.

379
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:41,984
Who knows what you are?

380
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,781
What are you talking about?

381
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:53,370
No matter how I look at it,
you're not the Lee Yeon I know.

382
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:57,416
-Who are you?
-I saved you from death.

383
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:59,752
-Who do I look like to you?
-I'll ask again.

384
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:04,214
Who are you?

385
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:08,093
As a bandit,
I've seen all sorts of foreign things,

386
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:10,387
but never anything like this.

387
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,557
Why would that be?

388
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:28,489
If you stay with me for the next month,
I'll give you this cell phone.

389
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:29,657
"Cell phone"?

390
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:32,910
If you stay with me for the next month…

391
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:34,995
What? Why are you in there?

392
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:37,498
There's more to show. Look.

393
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,834
We can even take pictures together…

394
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:45,798
or listen to music.

395
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:48,467
This is the only one you'll find
in this era.

396
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:51,220
You want it or not?

397
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,890
Plus, the answer to your question
can also be found in here.

398
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:58,268
The choice is yours.

399
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:13,409
You lost the Legendary Pipe?

400
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,953
To a Joseon demon?

401
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,248
There was more than one of them.

402
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:33,470
I don't recall ever saying
excuses were allowed.

403
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:04,293
Why were you defeated by a Joseon demon?

404
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:11,925
For those who fail, there is only death.

405
00:34:13,177 --> 00:34:15,220
So please, go ahead.

406
00:34:23,437 --> 00:34:26,565
Search every corner of Korea.

407
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:32,029
Search for an item that's stronger
than the Legendary Pipe.

408
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:36,533
So we're dealing with a real demon, huh?

409
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:42,498
And that's why you came to Joseon.

410
00:34:49,046 --> 00:34:51,006
OBOK BOUTIQUE

411
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:53,717
All right.

412
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:56,428
Try this on.

413
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:01,058
Isn't there anything brighter?
The kid's got a cool-toned complexion.

414
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:02,518
A what tone?

415
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:06,522
I mean, don't you have anything brighter?

416
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,357
-Like a brighter color or…
-Oh, yes.

417
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:12,444
First you take me to a barber, then here.
What's all this about?

418
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:15,572
Want the world to know
that you're a bandit leader?

419
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:17,825
See? You clean up nice.

420
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,953
-This one?
-Yes, yes.

421
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:24,206
Oh, this is great.
The material is nice too. Try it on.

422
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,457
Come on. Hurry.

423
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:29,294
Get one for yourself too.

424
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:32,756
I've already chosen a few.
Put these on the old hag's tab.

425
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,066
Let me get that for you.

426
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:53,652
Don't touch me.

427
00:35:54,403 --> 00:35:58,407
I'll show you how to tie it.
Put the wider side into the ring.

428
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:02,411
Yes.

429
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,621
Now, cross it below the narrow side.

430
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:07,624
No, not above. Below.

431
00:36:13,714 --> 00:36:14,882
You do it.

432
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:56,506
All done.

433
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:05,307
It suits you well.

434
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:09,186
I think it'll be perfect
if you add one last touch.

435
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,856
A smile?

436
00:37:14,483 --> 00:37:15,525
Smile a little.

437
00:37:19,363 --> 00:37:22,032
I don't smile very often.

438
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:48,767
-Hey! A beggar!
-What?

439
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,435
-Where, where?
-Over here!

440
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:51,937
-There he is!
-A beggar!

441
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,065
-Beggar, beggar!
-Beggar, beggar!

442
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,776
Kids, I'm not a beggar.

443
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:00,445
-Yes, you are!
-You're a beggar!

444
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:01,780
I'm not a beggar…

445
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,617
I said, I'm not a beggar!

446
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:10,998
What's wrong?

447
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:12,624
I thought I heard Shin-ju.

448
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:19,631
Where the hell is he, anyway?

449
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,601
NAENGMYEON, 10 CENTS

450
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:32,686
Ten cents!

HANGMYEONOK NOODLES

453
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:41,028
Are you hiring a delivery man?

454
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:46,616
Do you even know how to ride a bicycle?

455
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,369
Of course. I can ride with no hands.

456
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:52,205
Delivery requires strength, you know.

457
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,174
Impressive.

458
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,431
Come on out. Is anyone in there?

459
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:12,934
MYOYEONGAK

460
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:20,984
Welcome, baby.

461
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:27,365
Come in, while I'm being nice.

462
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,370
Rang. Rang!

463
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,832
So you were the owner of Myoyeongak.

464
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,919
Well, I'll get going, then.

465
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:42,547
I think I was too harsh earlier.

466
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:45,008
I was just so happy to see you.

467
00:39:45,509 --> 00:39:47,010
I lost my mind, you know.

468
00:39:47,511 --> 00:39:50,597
No, it's fine.
That's how friends play, right?

469
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,599
-Feel free to stay.
-That's all right.

470
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:55,227
Stay, if you don't want me to lose it.

471
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:57,729
I'd love to stay,

472
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:00,148
but I prefer hotels, so…

473
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:02,275
-Then go.
-Really? You sure?

474
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:03,610
I'll just smash that hotel.

475
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,449
-Fine. I'll stay here.
-Really?

476
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:12,744
-I'll take extra good care of you.
-Don't.

477
00:40:12,828 --> 00:40:15,580
Treat me just like the other guests.
That's my condition.

478
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:18,750
Fine.

479
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:21,920
Promise?

480
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,631
Promise.

481
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:28,135
Gosh! That's enough!

482
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,179
It's a stamp.

483
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:34,599
What did I do to deserve this?

484
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:39,229
He's just so adorable.

485
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,526
Gosh.

486
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:48,947
Watch his every move from now on.

487
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,243
What will you do with him?

488
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:56,288
Jae-yu.

489
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:00,500
Have I ever lost prey I had my eyes on?

490
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:03,503
I'll make him mine.

491
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:07,674
Even if I have to kill and taxidermy him.

492
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:24,357
Oh, gosh.

493
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,654
Geez, do I have to tuck you in?

494
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:58,516
I promise I'll return.

496
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:16,534
Lord Lee Yeon…

497
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,372
Yoo-ri…

498
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:43,186
Your madam, is that prominent a figure?

499
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,896
Don't you read the news?

500
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:48,316
Among all the Gyeongseong gisaengs,
there's no other like our madam.

501
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,112
Rice, gold mines, bonds--
Everything she touched was a big hit.

502
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:55,156
Should I rob her?

503
00:42:56,408 --> 00:42:57,784
What's her secret?

504
00:42:57,867 --> 00:43:02,038
All information in Gyeongseong
is said to come from Myoyeongak.

505
00:43:02,122 --> 00:43:04,958
To be precise, it comes from our madam.

506
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:08,670
So Hong-ju is an informant…

507
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:18,138
So your father sold you
for a longer life span?

508
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:20,390
He didn't sell me…

509
00:43:21,558 --> 00:43:24,853
-My father had his reasons too.
-Throw her out or sell her.

510
00:43:25,437 --> 00:43:28,440
I hate it when they're poor, yet nice.
They irritate me.

511
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:30,567
The world isn't some magical garden.

512
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:34,988
I'll teach her well to do the chores.

513
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:37,824
-We have plenty who can do that.
-I'll stop.

514
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:40,160
I won't pretend to be nice anymore.

515
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:42,662
I just felt like I might die…

516
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:46,499
if I didn't forgive my father.

517
00:43:48,168 --> 00:43:49,502
Don't forgive so easily.

518
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:53,840
Then the world will throw anything
at you to forgive.

519
00:43:56,926 --> 00:43:59,179
Hey, I've been looking everywhere for you.

520
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:01,473
Who are you bothering
so early in the morning?

521
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:02,807
Oh, it's you.

522
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,144
Your new name is Jook-hyang.

523
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:07,729
Oh, Jook-hyang.

524
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:08,813
Go on.

525
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:12,067
Okay, go on.

526
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:18,073
-Did you sleep well?
-Why are you acting cute?

527
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:19,657
Find someone for me.

528
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:22,369
He appeared three days ago
wearing a red-white mask.

529
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:25,121
-Why not?
-Really?

530
00:44:25,205 --> 00:44:26,206
On one condition.

531
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:29,834
There's an important event held
in Gyeongseong today.

532
00:44:29,918 --> 00:44:32,253
Make your bet!

533
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:35,757
Make your bet on who will become
Miss Joseon!

534
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:39,135
1938 MISS JOSEON PAGEANT

535
00:44:41,638 --> 00:44:44,099
SPONSORS
BANDO HOTEL, SEONWOO DAILY

536
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:51,898
Welcome, reporter! It's been a while.

537
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,067
Is your father doing well?

538
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:06,704
Hey, Ki Yoo-ri. What are you doing
in this era? You come with Shin-ju?

539
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:09,457
You got the wrong person.

540
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:14,754
-Damn it! Give them to me!
-Yoo-ri.

541
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:16,464
-Give me the ground cherries!
-No!

542
00:45:16,548 --> 00:45:17,966
You're not her?

543
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:20,718
You saw me at Gyeongseong Station, right?

544
00:45:21,386 --> 00:45:23,012
I've never met you before.

545
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:31,396
Geez, they're just copy-and-pasting
people's faces now, huh?

546
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:35,483
You're the spitting image of her.

547
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:38,069
By the way, who are you?

548
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:41,781
That's Myoyeongak's President Ryu's seat.

549
00:45:41,865 --> 00:45:44,409
I'm here on her behalf.
She went to find gold mines.

550
00:45:49,456 --> 00:45:51,833
You've all been waiting a long time!

551
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:56,754
Introducing the contestants
for today's pageant!

552
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:34,834
-Oh, dear!
-Goodness!

553
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:39,756
Miss Joseon?

554
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,758
A gisaeng preparing for the pageant

555
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:45,011
caused a scene in the room
of a guest who was asleep.

556
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:46,721
She bit off an arm

557
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:49,474
-and went missing.
-And the guest?

558
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:53,436
He barely escaped death,
but he wants his left arm back.

559
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,523
This sounds like a familiar repertoire…

560
00:46:56,606 --> 00:46:59,067
An abnormal appetite for food
and carnal desire.

561
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,527
Could it be the three worms?

562
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:03,655
THREE WORMS:
CREATURES CONTROLLING "DESIRES"

563
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:07,450
If one controls the three worms,
one can't be an ordinary guy.

564
00:47:07,534 --> 00:47:09,410
Contestant number seven!

565
00:47:09,953 --> 00:47:14,541
From a town of many beauties, Pyongyang,
Miss Song Eun-sil, 22 years old.

566
00:47:14,624 --> 00:47:17,627
She usually enjoys listening to Schubert.

567
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,754
If you listen to Schubert's
"The Wild Rose…"

568
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,423
Her collarbones are slightly off, no?

569
00:47:23,091 --> 00:47:25,593
Oh, gosh. Her earlobes are too thin.

570
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:28,805
How ridiculous.

571
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:30,682
I am Song Eun-sil, the wild rose.

572
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:33,309
Contestant number ten.

573
00:47:33,393 --> 00:47:37,188
Miss Yang Young-Ae,
who came all the way from Busan by train.

574
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,816
Her dream is to become a movie star.

575
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:41,526
-Wow!
-I can be cute.

576
00:47:43,987 --> 00:47:45,196
I can also dance.

577
00:47:45,822 --> 00:47:48,741
-A radiant smile, and an all-rounder.
-She looks familiar.

578
00:47:48,825 --> 00:47:50,827
I'm Yang Young-Ae.

579
00:47:58,334 --> 00:47:59,961
What about the score?

580
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:02,922
Leave me out of it.
It's not like I'm grading Korean beef.

581
00:48:04,132 --> 00:48:06,968
They say the lady from Busan
is the prettiest!

582
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:08,428
You sure it's Busan?

583
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:12,098
-You bet on Busan?
-Oh, dear. Busan might win, then.

584
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:17,854
You sure it's not Hamgyong?

585
00:48:22,025 --> 00:48:26,237
Hosted by Seonwoo Daily,
the first Miss Joseon Pageant.

586
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:29,866
With the exception of one abstention,
all judges unanimously voted for her.

587
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:31,534
The winner of Miss Joseon is…

588
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:37,624
Miss Yang Young-Ae from Busan.

589
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:43,129
Hwashin Department Store's sponsorship
now goes to Miss Yang Young-Ae.

590
00:48:51,471 --> 00:48:53,723
Thank you all so much!

591
00:48:55,058 --> 00:48:57,769
Although they were against
my participation,

592
00:48:57,852 --> 00:49:00,938
I want to share this joy with my family.

593
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:07,362
Why is it so hot?

594
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:11,741
I'm sorry.

595
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:16,454
I would like to thank

596
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:20,375
the director
of the Choi Seung-ja Hair Salon.

597
00:49:26,089 --> 00:49:27,382
Can I take off my clothes?

598
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,551
My body feels burning hot.

599
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:37,100
We will now take a commemorative photo.

600
00:49:38,393 --> 00:49:40,019
On the count of three.

601
00:49:40,937 --> 00:49:42,480
One, two…

602
00:49:57,704 --> 00:49:59,414
What's wrong? Young-Ae…

603
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:23,062
You okay?

604
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:31,237
Damn.

605
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:15,698
Aside from Miss Joseon and the gisaeng
from Myoyeongak, there's more?

606
00:51:15,782 --> 00:51:20,244
I heard a rumor that Gyeongseong's
beauties have turned into Yachas.

607
00:51:20,328 --> 00:51:22,163
YACHA: A DEMON THAT COVETS
HUMAN FLESH AND BLOOD

608
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:24,499
Only beautiful women are targeted.

609
00:51:26,209 --> 00:51:28,544
If so, the suspect must be…

610
00:51:29,629 --> 00:51:31,005
Must be…

611
00:51:31,631 --> 00:51:32,715
Super ugly.

612
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:38,679
You're calling that reasoning?
Are you a real detective?

613
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:39,764
Goodness.

614
00:51:41,474 --> 00:51:44,560
Can't you tell from my costume?
Obviously I'm a detective.

615
00:51:44,644 --> 00:51:47,146
By the way, I'm also the one
who saved your life.

616
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:52,109
So?

617
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:54,821
What is it you want to know?

618
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:58,366
A common link between the Yachas.

619
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:04,247
They've all been to the same beauty salon:
Choi Seung-ja Hair Salon.

620
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:06,332
Okay.

621
00:52:07,083 --> 00:52:11,462
CHOI SEUNG-JA HAIR SALON

622
00:52:11,546 --> 00:52:13,130
No, I don't want to!

623
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:16,676
You're the best at disguises.

624
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:19,053
But never a human woman. I'm out.

625
00:52:21,556 --> 00:52:24,350
If we solve this case,
we can catch the guy who stabbed you.

626
00:52:24,934 --> 00:52:26,227
-Red-white mask?
-Exactly.

627
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,895
It's for information exchange.

628
00:52:27,979 --> 00:52:29,438
Will you seek revenge?

629
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:36,195
Who are we? Foxes always repay kindness
and repay their debt.

630
00:52:36,279 --> 00:52:38,322
Fine. But I'll go as a customer instead.

631
00:52:38,406 --> 00:52:41,909
-They don't take male customers.
-Damn, I don't want to turn into a girl…

632
00:52:44,537 --> 00:52:46,873
You should just work here.

633
00:52:46,956 --> 00:52:48,666
HELP WANTED

634
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:55,464
Ma'am!

635
00:52:55,548 --> 00:52:57,300
What do you want?

636
00:52:57,383 --> 00:52:59,260
-They're waiting.
-Cut it out.

637
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:02,597
What will a male employee say
about Choi Seung-ja Hair Salon?

638
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,099
-Tell them to go home.
-Just take one look at him.

639
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,435
Why are you pestering me
at such an early hour?

640
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:09,729
-Just stay still!
-Just a minute, please.

641
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:10,980
You go tell them…

642
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:16,110
Our hair salon
will never hire male employees.

643
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:25,119
Tastes just right.

644
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:44,347
Beautiful male sculptures
from the Louvre in Paris.

645
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,645
It's a pity that you won't hire men.

646
00:53:52,188 --> 00:53:53,481
Let's go.

647
00:53:54,023 --> 00:53:55,274
Monsieur!

648
00:53:58,945 --> 00:54:00,571
You're hired.

649
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:07,328
Shampooing is your most popular treatment?
You mean hair washing?

650
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:11,874
Even if it's a bit expensive,
most customers come here for a shampoo.

651
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:14,043
Can't they just wash their hair at home?

652
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:17,254
First, brush thoroughly
for about 20 to 30 minutes.

653
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:18,965
-And then--
-I know.

654
00:54:19,048 --> 00:54:22,635
You rub the shampoo on their head,
just like how you wash your hands.

655
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:24,679
Gosh, how manly.

656
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:33,270
You want me to make coffee?

657
00:54:33,354 --> 00:54:35,564
This is canned coffee.

658
00:54:35,648 --> 00:54:37,233
And this is ssanghwa tea.

659
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:38,943
This is green tea.

660
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:40,611
One question.

661
00:54:41,821 --> 00:54:45,241
I'd like a rich cup of coffee
made by Monsieur Lee…

662
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:51,372
Two spoonfuls each of coffee,
cream and sugar?

663
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:54,125
Oh, merci!

664
00:54:54,709 --> 00:54:56,585
-Oh, my. Auntie.
-Yes?

665
00:54:56,669 --> 00:55:00,256
The mirror outside is broken.
Why aren't you rushing to clean it up?

666
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:03,592
-I'm sorry, Director--
-You always say you're sorry!

667
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:05,469
Oh, my.

668
00:55:05,553 --> 00:55:08,723
I've seen a broken mirror
for the umpteenth time since the opening!

669
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:11,892
Are you sure you didn't do it, Auntie?

670
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:18,649
You think this is your house?

671
00:55:18,733 --> 00:55:20,484
Do you know of the three worms?

672
00:55:20,568 --> 00:55:22,611
None of the doctors
at Gyeongseong University do.

673
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:26,532
-Who told you about that?
-A guy who calls himself a detective.

674
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:29,368
I think his name was Lee Yeon…

675
00:55:31,871 --> 00:55:36,959
The three worms control humans
once they sink into the human head.

676
00:55:37,043 --> 00:55:38,335
What do they control?

677
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:42,006
One's physiological desires for food
and sexual intercourse.

678
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:43,799
It's not contagious, is it?

679
00:55:43,883 --> 00:55:45,259
No, it's not.

680
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:49,430
Once its eggs hatch in the body,
the infected becomes the worms' host.

681
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:51,390
How do the eggs get into the body?

682
00:55:51,474 --> 00:55:54,477
You can eat them,
drink them or apply them to skin.

683
00:56:02,193 --> 00:56:03,235
Is there someone here?

684
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:05,071
I have a guest.

685
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,141
Please come again.

686
00:56:34,225 --> 00:56:35,434
-Delivery!
-Oh, my goodness!

687
00:56:35,518 --> 00:56:37,353
-Gosh!
-What's this?

688
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:39,897
How dare you come here looking like that?

689
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:42,399
You ordered naengmyeon.

690
00:56:42,483 --> 00:56:45,319
Me? No, I didn't.

691
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:46,737
Oh, just leave it outside.

692
00:56:46,821 --> 00:56:49,907
This is a sophisticated hair salon.

693
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:51,492
So stinky…

694
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:56,705
All the mirrors here are broken.

695
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:00,417
Come this way, please.

696
00:57:02,545 --> 00:57:04,130
Take a seat here, please.

697
00:57:07,216 --> 00:57:09,802
She's a special customer.
Take good care of her.

698
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:10,928
Yes, ma'am.

699
00:57:16,517 --> 00:57:17,560
What's this?

700
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,564
Three worms! Worms, worms!

701
00:57:23,983 --> 00:57:25,776
Were you the host, Granny?

702
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:27,403
You a disguised demon?

703
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:31,323
Goodness. The lice in my hair
have been bothering me lately.

704
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:33,200
Lice?

705
00:57:36,245 --> 00:57:39,707
Gosh. Please don't touch me, ma'am.

706
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:42,960
We're natives of this town for 20 years.

707
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:46,088
If you get on our bad side,
you won't be able to work here.

708
00:57:46,172 --> 00:57:47,756
You want to get on my bad side?

709
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,217
Three worms. It's those ladies.

710
00:57:50,301 --> 00:57:52,803
No, they're just hitting on you.

711
00:57:52,887 --> 00:57:55,264
You said it was either the director
or the employees.

712
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:57,850
The employee I'm marking is just pathetic.

713
00:57:57,933 --> 00:57:59,518
Mine's just chatty.

714
00:57:59,602 --> 00:58:01,645
It's the director, then. Let's get her.

715
00:58:01,729 --> 00:58:05,191
I heard there's a very special item here.

716
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:14,742
This is the cream I told you about.

717
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:17,244
You put this cream on your face, right?

718
00:58:18,037 --> 00:58:22,249
Then your skin becomes as bright
as a Western porcelain doll.

719
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:26,170
-Where's Yeon?
-He's undercover at the beauty salon.

720
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:27,379
It must be worth watching.

721
00:58:28,047 --> 00:58:32,259
You scour all over Gyeongseong
and find a guy known as red-white mask.

722
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,470
Are you trying to help Lee Yeon?

723
00:58:34,553 --> 00:58:38,641
I'm not sure.
Should I help Lee Yeon or him?

724
00:58:38,724 --> 00:58:41,894
-If you need, spend some money.
-How much?

725
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:43,812
Obviously…

726
00:58:46,482 --> 00:58:48,651
until I get the answer I want.

727
00:58:51,612 --> 00:58:52,988
It's broken here too.

728
00:58:53,072 --> 00:58:54,740
Every mirror in here is broken.

729
00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:55,950
SHAMPOO, THREE CENTS

730
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:57,326
Broken mirrors…

731
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:02,414
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

732
00:59:02,498 --> 00:59:04,166
Let's get new mirrors here.

733
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:06,835
It's a beauty salon,
but only with broken mirrors.

734
00:59:06,919 --> 00:59:09,213
-Oh, you're right.
-I'll find some suppliers.

735
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:13,300
How reliable. Please take care of it.
Let's get going, then.

736
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:17,972
-Well, thank you for your hard work.
-Goodbye.

737
00:59:19,515 --> 00:59:21,517
Goodbye, ma'am.

738
00:59:22,268 --> 00:59:23,727
Not much of a reaction.

739
00:59:25,688 --> 00:59:27,982
You even cleaned up for me.

740
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:30,943
I feel so bad. Please have some.

741
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:33,070
-He's in a bandit gang.
-Pardon?

742
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:34,989
He means, "Is the drink poisoned?"

743
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:37,283
No, of course not.

744
00:59:37,992 --> 00:59:39,493
Take a sip first.

745
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:43,956
Oh, okay. Thank you. Go home now. Bye.

746
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:45,374
Out you go.

747
00:59:51,005 --> 00:59:54,842
Hey, come here.
There's a cream the size of your palm…

748
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:58,929
-You mean they put the worms in there?
-Yeah. Go check it out.

749
00:59:59,722 --> 01:00:00,931
Where are you going?

750
01:00:01,015 --> 01:00:03,392
Something's bothering me.
I'll go check it out.

751
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,063
-Who is it?
-Damn it.

752
01:00:08,147 --> 01:00:09,231
Hey, hide, hide!

753
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:20,576
-Return the bowls, please!
-Fresh eggs! Fresh eggs!

754
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:24,204
-I'm here for the bowls--
-Fresh eggs have…

755
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:27,333
Gosh, that scared me.

756
01:00:29,043 --> 01:00:30,461
You check that out, okay?

757
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:34,715
What did you expect me to do
if you close without putting the bowl out?

758
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:36,842
Why condescend and scorn a person…

759
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:46,435
Something's strange about this place.

760
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:50,314
-What about it?
-I don't see any indigenous gods.

761
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:53,942
It's a new building.
Maybe there's nowhere for them to nest.

762
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:58,655
Hey, give these to me.
Tell your guys to get some mirrors.

763
01:00:59,406 --> 01:01:00,407
Mirrors?

764
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:02,201
CHARLES RICK

765
01:01:02,284 --> 01:01:05,037
The director sells this cream
to her special customers.

766
01:01:06,872 --> 01:01:09,666
My father owns a pharmaceutical company.
I'll check the ingredients.

767
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,420
Hey, be careful.

768
01:01:15,381 --> 01:01:16,715
You worried about me?

769
01:01:18,509 --> 01:01:22,262
If you get hurt with that face,
there's this guy who'll lose it.

770
01:01:27,226 --> 01:01:30,020
You sure nothing's in the cream?

771
01:01:30,104 --> 01:01:31,146
Yeah, nothing.

772
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:34,066
Then we're doing that shit again?

773
01:01:35,651 --> 01:01:36,652
Let's do it again.

774
01:01:42,491 --> 01:01:45,202
Oh, my. Why are you two so late?

775
01:01:45,285 --> 01:01:47,371
Come on in. This is them!

776
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:57,214
Gosh, why don't you wash
your hair at home…

777
01:01:57,297 --> 01:01:59,842
Hello? This is Choi Seung-ja's Hair Salon.

778
01:01:59,925 --> 01:02:03,846
Oh, ma'am.
I'm sorry, but reservations are full.

779
01:02:05,764 --> 01:02:07,266
-Oh, my goodness!
-Oh, my.

780
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:18,861
Lower yourself.

781
01:02:20,112 --> 01:02:21,447
Lower!

782
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:25,868
What's this?

783
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:28,537
Who dares order our boss to serve tea?

784
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,038
I'll kill them all!

785
01:02:30,831 --> 01:02:32,875
What's that? Oh, my!

786
01:02:36,044 --> 01:02:38,505
-For goodness sake!
-What's wrong?

787
01:02:39,631 --> 01:02:41,425
Gosh, stop it!

788
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:45,345
You have the mirrors?

789
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:49,766
We got it. Here you are, boss!

790
01:02:56,315 --> 01:02:57,941
I said, "A full-length mirror."

791
01:02:58,942 --> 01:02:59,943
Now,

792
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:05,866
if you just take three steps back,
you can see your whole body.

793
01:03:07,493 --> 01:03:08,619
My goodness…

794
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:12,956
But why are you caught
at a place like this, boss?

795
01:03:13,665 --> 01:03:15,209
How strong are they?

796
01:03:15,876 --> 01:03:17,920
I'm not caught. Just go away.

797
01:03:18,504 --> 01:03:20,464
Then what should we do?

798
01:03:21,882 --> 01:03:24,801
Just give us your order, boss!

799
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:28,222
Be a rickshaw worker or something.

800
01:03:30,933 --> 01:03:31,934
Yes, boss!

801
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:52,621
Hey, you can't kill her!

802
01:03:53,664 --> 01:03:54,748
Gosh, such a hassle.

803
01:04:26,905 --> 01:04:28,115
Here!

804
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:46,216
So they just went crazy out of nowhere?

805
01:04:47,134 --> 01:04:48,302
It was the shampoo.

806
01:04:48,969 --> 01:04:51,597
Someone put the three worms
in the shampoo at night.

807
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:53,807
If not the director or employees,
then who?

808
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,434
Geez. This is such a mess.

809
01:05:03,275 --> 01:05:04,610
-It was you?
-Don't go near her!

810
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,613
She's an indigenous god.

811
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:13,952
The mirror!

812
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:17,956
Why are you siding with the mortals?

813
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,000
Why?

814
01:05:35,807 --> 01:05:36,892
Let go of me.

815
01:05:37,643 --> 01:05:39,561
She couldn't have done it alone.

816
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:43,982
Are you the kitchen god?

817
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:46,234
You know me?

818
01:05:46,318 --> 01:05:50,030
You were burned to death in a furnace.
You're the first kitchen god.

819
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:51,573
KITCHEN GOD:
DEITY OF WOODEN STOVES

820
01:05:51,657 --> 01:05:52,783
Don't look at me.

821
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:54,951
All sympathies aside,

822
01:05:55,035 --> 01:05:58,413
a ball of inferiority complexes
should never be appointed as a deity.

823
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:00,540
Why did you release the worms?

824
01:06:00,624 --> 01:06:05,587
I was living a quiet life, but they built
this salon with mirrors all over.

825
01:06:06,213 --> 01:06:08,757
And people used to hide mirrors
to serve me!

826
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:11,385
That why you're letting it out
on those pretty girls?

827
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:14,805
They've destroyed everything,
from the stoves to the furnaces…

828
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:19,434
They don't even offer purified water now.

829
01:06:22,646 --> 01:06:26,066
I'm telling you this
because I can see into the future a bit.

830
01:06:27,275 --> 01:06:30,904
In less then 50 years,
Gyeongseong will stop using wooden stoves.

831
01:06:33,198 --> 01:06:35,367
-What of the embers?
-They'll use gas--

832
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:37,577
-Details aren't important.
-They must cook rice, no?

833
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:39,913
Instant rice. It's really good too.

834
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:42,833
Instant rice? My goodness!

835
01:06:46,294 --> 01:06:48,505
Times have changed
and will continue to do so.

836
01:06:48,588 --> 01:06:50,173
You must make a choice too.

837
01:06:50,257 --> 01:06:53,051
Learn how to live in harmony
or just disappear.

838
01:06:54,302 --> 01:06:55,846
Aren't you going to kill her?

839
01:06:55,929 --> 01:06:57,764
They're very conservative beings.

840
01:06:57,848 --> 01:07:00,726
The indigenous gods need time to adjust,
you know.

841
01:07:00,809 --> 01:07:02,477
This isn't like you.

842
01:07:05,105 --> 01:07:06,398
Where did you get the worms?

843
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:09,276
Someone gave them to me
so I can claim my territory.

844
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,236
-Who?
-He said not to tell.

845
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:12,654
Then die.

846
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:17,325
A mask--

847
01:07:17,409 --> 01:07:18,660
It was a man wearing a mask.

848
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:21,079
A red…

849
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:25,208
and white mask.

850
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:39,890
She was ordered to die
if she opened her mouth.

851
01:07:39,973 --> 01:07:41,433
Red-white mask,

852
01:07:43,143 --> 01:07:44,811
who the hell are you?

853
01:08:01,787 --> 01:08:05,832
You're the only one
who survived the three worms.

854
01:08:09,961 --> 01:08:12,005
I'll turn you into the perfect Yacha.

855
01:08:39,574 --> 01:08:40,742
Hong-ju?

856
01:08:40,826 --> 01:08:41,910
Red-white mask…

857
01:08:43,787 --> 01:08:45,080
was you?

858
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:00,303
You haven't changed one bit.

859
01:09:04,891 --> 01:09:06,685
Why are you the red-white mask?

860
01:09:08,812 --> 01:09:10,480
-Why meddle with Lee Yeon--
-Hong-ju.

861
01:09:10,564 --> 01:09:13,358
I'm no longer
the Cheon Mu-young you once knew.

862
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:14,860
The same goes for Lee Yeon.

863
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:23,910
I've missed you.

864
01:09:34,754 --> 01:09:36,172
I can't believe…

865
01:09:39,217 --> 01:09:40,677
you made it back alive.

866
01:09:50,729 --> 01:09:53,356
Gross. Damn it! My shoes!

867
01:09:54,149 --> 01:09:55,984
Geez. Let me see.

868
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:02,157
Pass! Next!

869
01:10:04,659 --> 01:10:06,661
-Wrap it up nicely.
-Yes, boss!

870
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:11,374
What on earth happened here?

871
01:10:11,458 --> 01:10:13,627
-Next, next. Come on!
-What's going on?

872
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:16,212
How did you know?

873
01:10:16,296 --> 01:10:18,423
That burning mugwort
will shoo the worms off.

874
01:10:18,506 --> 01:10:22,260
I didn't know.
This is an organic bug repellent.

875
01:10:22,344 --> 01:10:24,721
And the three worms are bugs, after all.

876
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:30,810
-Can it get rid of you?
-Respect your older brother, you punk.

877
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:02,884
Koo Shin-ju!

878
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:05,804
Lord Lee Yeon!

879
01:11:44,009 --> 01:11:45,343
Geez, sir.

880
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:51,182
Where have you been all this time?
Why did you leave me behind?

881
01:11:51,266 --> 01:11:55,186
-Hey, I'm so sorry.
-I made so many deliveries a day…

882
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:56,896
-Do you even know?
-Great work--

883
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:58,398
Forget it.

884
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,654
-Lord Lee Rang?
-Koo Shin-ju…

885
01:12:08,033 --> 01:12:09,034
Rang…

886
01:12:09,784 --> 01:12:12,996
-I missed you so much, Rang!
-Take this--

887
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:17,709
-Stop acting like we're friends.
-Gosh, stop being so harsh.

888
01:12:18,293 --> 01:12:19,294
Gosh.

889
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:22,881
I came here to see Lord Lee Rang and you.

890
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,301
Going through that shit was all worth it!

891
01:12:27,886 --> 01:12:29,095
Good job.

892
01:12:31,598 --> 01:12:32,599
Let's go.

893
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:23,483
TALE OF THE NINE TAILED

894
01:13:47,507 --> 01:13:49,968
They're not the guys I used to know.

895
01:13:50,051 --> 01:13:52,637
If it's not Lee Yeon, then who?

896
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,472
Show Lee Yeon your pretty eyes.

897
01:13:55,306 --> 01:13:57,308
I feel like I saw something
I shouldn't have.

898
01:13:57,976 --> 01:14:01,229
Say the word, and I might side with you.

899
01:14:01,312 --> 01:14:03,898
You saw what was behind that mask,
didn't you?

900
01:14:03,982 --> 01:14:05,900
I have a bad feeling.

901
01:14:05,984 --> 01:14:07,986
You'll be stuck in the past forever.

902
01:14:08,069 --> 01:14:09,988
-Help!
-Seeing everything you cared for

903
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:11,489
die before your eyes.

904
01:14:11,573 --> 01:14:13,366
Red-white mask, you bastard!

905
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:15,451
I'm never going to let you live.

906
01:14:16,119 --> 01:14:18,788
Go spread some rumors
to the demons of Gyeongseong…

907
01:14:20,582 --> 01:14:22,250
that Lee Yeon went blind.
