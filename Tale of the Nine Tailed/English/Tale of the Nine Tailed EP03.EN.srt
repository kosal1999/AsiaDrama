1
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:56,974
TALE OF THE NINE TAILED

2
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,268
That's good, give me more.

3
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:02,438
Hey, drink up.

4
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,148
That's not it!

5
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,108
Hey, come here!

6
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:08,819
Want to try it? Drink it.

7
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,404
You can drink it.

8
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:11,864
Cheers.

9
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:13,407
Why? Hey, you.

10
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:17,161
What is it? What's wrong?

11
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:18,245
Do you hate me?

12
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:20,456
Just do it!

13
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,525
What's this?

14
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,324
You'd like to buy her for the night?

15
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,203
So, you're the Madame?

16
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:03,290
Talking to her is like talking to a wall.

17
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,543
You speak Korean very well.

18
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:10,673
That's because I've spent many nights
with Joseon bitches.

19
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:12,842
And tonight, it'll be her.

20
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,011
They're not prostitutes.

21
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,721
They are artists.

22
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,099
If I say I'll be paying,

23
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:24,603
you'd better sell art and your bodies too.

24
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:26,146
And if we don't?

25
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,400
Then, there will be a hole in her head.

26
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,297
How about me?

27
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:53,674
If you'll have me, instead of that girl.

28
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,885
Wow. Amazing!

29
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,304
How much are you worth?

30
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,473
Even better. I'm free.

31
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:06,478
You're a cheap one, huh?

32
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,525
Strip her.

33
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,235
Yes, sir.

34
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,075
On one condition.

35
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,201
A condition?

36
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,123
If you defeat me in a drinking contest,

37
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,625
do whatever you'd like with me.

38
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:32,004
You're an interesting bitch.
If I win, I'll have you…

39
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:36,050
and I'll take this wrist too.

40
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,141
-If it pleases you, sir.
-On one condition.

41
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,727
I will set the rules.

42
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:53,442
Goodness, eat slowly.

43
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,735
EPISODE 3

44
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:00,115
You have quite the colorful life, huh?

45
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:03,285
You only just got here,
but you already got drafted, hired,

46
00:04:03,369 --> 00:04:04,495
and even robbed?

47
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:06,997
Please buy me a gun.

48
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,542
What for?
You've always been afraid of guns, no?

49
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,420
I'm going to fight for independence.

50
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,465
We are here…

51
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,511
on a mission
to protect the era we're from.

52
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,597
Catch the red-white mask,

53
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:25,683
find the Guardian Stone,
and return safely.

54
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,935
-That's our mission.
-But still--

55
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:31,647
If you insist on fighting,
don't think about returning home.

56
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,649
Stay here and take responsibility.

57
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:37,277
Humans in this era are risking
their bloody lives fighting.

58
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:41,573
Are you sure we can go back?

59
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:43,742
We must.

60
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:45,577
They don't even have Wi-Fi here.

61
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:47,329
No mint chocolate either.

62
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:50,874
Nor my Ji-ah.

63
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,876
But you have Lord Lee Rang here.

64
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:57,089
Hey, I saw him almost die
as soon as I got here.

65
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,716
I thought my heart would explode.

66
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,426
But you saved him.

67
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:03,595
I hope he does well without me.

68
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,682
But he's playing boss of some bandit gang.

69
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,727
I don't know if I could leave him behind.

70
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,937
When are you going to tell him?

71
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:13,355
Tell him what?

72
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,483
That I'll disappear after a month?

73
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:19,987
You have to give him time
to accept that you're not here to stay.

74
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,453
Oh, dear.

75
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,247
-Eat up.
-What if she loses?

76
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,624
-Gosh, what should we do?
-Oh, no. This is bad.

77
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:33,709
Rang.

78
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,211
Rang.

79
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,886
Goodness, what do we do?

80
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,180
Shouldn't we stop her?

81
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,401
Let's begin!

82
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:45,697
Oh, no.

83
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,659
She might die doing this!

84
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:50,661
What do we do?

85
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,341
Incompetent fools.

86
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,817
I'm okay. I can still drink.

87
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,913
Get me a jar.

88
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,458
Hey! Bring us a jar!

89
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,613
Oh, my! Oh, wow!

90
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,658
Yeah. That's more like it, Ryu Hong-joo.

91
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:57,162
But where did this punk go? Rang? Rang!

92
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,334
Your men are so weak.

93
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,461
Can they even do a man's deed properly?

94
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,547
You wretched geisha!

95
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,648
It's broken.

96
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:27,359
Will you give it to me?

97
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,072
Gosh.

98
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:45,043
You bitch, next time I'll definitely--

99
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:49,006
Who are you?

100
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,389
You like the gayageum, no?

101
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:23,081
You're alive. You're alive in this era.

102
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,709
I will never give up on you.

103
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,337
Plus, the answer to your question
can also be found in here.

104
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,921
He is Lee Yeon…

105
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,257
And yet, he's not.

106
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,553
Then what is he?

107
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:19,971
A mermaid?

108
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,057
I'll show you how to tie it.

109
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,232
What's this? A circus?

110
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:33,318
What's with the tail?

111
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:35,070
Shut up!

112
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,279
Hear, hear!

113
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,286
Do it!

114
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,498
Shall we see if that's a real tail?

115
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:51,628
-What the hell!
-Be quiet, will you?

116
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,221
Damn it!

117
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:21,825
-You're a real mermaid, aren't you?
-A half-blood. Father's a human fisherman.

118
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,453
-And you're here because?
-I want to become a singer.

119
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:27,497
Whether you become a singer
or a spectacle,

120
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,958
just do one or the other.

121
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:45,849
Hold on!

122
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:52,481
This is my scale.

123
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,357
-If you ever need me--
-I don't need it.

124
00:12:58,528 --> 00:12:59,779
Take it.

125
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:01,490
I said no need.

126
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:07,287
Goodbye.

127
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:14,461
The tie suits you well.

128
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:29,643
Why did you do all that,
for someone like me?

129
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,940
Because I only distinguish
the world into two categories.

130
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,859
Those on my side, and those who are not.

131
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:42,989
I'll either risk my life to protect,
or risk my life to destroy.

132
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:45,617
You're the first person.

133
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,328
The first person to treat gisaengs
like human beings.

134
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:50,539
Did you cry earlier?

135
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,500
No, I didn't cry until the end.

136
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,127
Just as you taught me not to, Madame.

137
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,130
Good job.

138
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:04,427
-Are you full?
-Not even.

139
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,639
I drank so much without a snack,
my stomach feels empty.

140
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,599
Shall I grill some neobiani for you?

141
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,935
Where can he be at this hour?

142
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:14,938
Gosh, that brat.

143
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:40,880
Aren't you sleeping?

144
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,384
-What've you been up to?
-I was drinking. Why?

145
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,012
Your new curfew is 10 p.m.

146
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:48,972
Crazy fool.

147
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:50,515
I don't trust you.

148
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,206
Who is there?

149
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,214
You must be the gatekeeper.

150
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:09,803
You reek of blood.

151
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,597
As a descendant of the Siberian tiger,

152
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:15,642
how can you covet such impious things?

153
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,936
Because I am impious.

154
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,521
Go back.

155
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:23,525
All that's left in that jar

156
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,319
is resentment and regret.

157
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:29,864
That's also what's left inside of me.

158
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:33,535
The seal hasn't been broken
in over 500 years.

159
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:34,786
But today…

160
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,623
it will be broken.

161
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:20,457
Take this!

162
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,328
That's enough, sir.

163
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:01,372
My stove's boiling nurungji,
so I better go before it burns.

164
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:02,457
Strike him!

165
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,254
It's a fire.

166
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,927
You poor little thing.

167
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,179
Go.

168
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,224
Show Lee Yeon your pretty eyes.

169
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,400
What do you want?

170
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:13,444
This?

171
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,115
It must be special to you.

172
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:51,900
Where are you?

173
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:53,610
Where are you?

174
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,295
Found you.

175
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,058
Look at me.

176
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:29,437
Look at me.

177
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:34,025
Why did you do it?
Why did you break your promise? Why?

178
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:40,365
-What? What's going on?
-Someone is in our room.

179
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,042
I don't see anyone. Did you have a dream?

180
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,086
I'm sure someone was here.

181
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,171
What? Who was here?

182
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:57,382
I don't know.

183
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,509
I don't know what it is, but…

184
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,595
I feel like I saw something
I shouldn't have.

185
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:17,235
Gosh.

186
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:22,115
Look who it is.

187
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:27,078
What are you doing here, Master?

188
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,998
Because I own this place.

189
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:35,044
Oh, no wonder.
I-- I couldn't sleep well last night.

190
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:39,298
How dare you run from me
to go serve Lee Yeon?

191
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:42,468
-You tried to kill me!
-I told you to stay out of my sight, no?

192
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,053
Come here! Koo Shin-ju!

193
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:46,973
No. Everything that comes
into my forest is mine.

194
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,518
Koo Shin-ju.

195
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:52,603
Mark my words.

196
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:54,355
Next time I see you,

197
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,483
consider your arms and legs gone.

198
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,278
Please have mercy!

199
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,822
Let's start with a beating.

200
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:06,200
No! No!

201
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:07,744
Shin-ju, you there?

202
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,413
Lord Lee Yeon!

203
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,751
-Hey.
-So great to see you again, Shin-ju!

204
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,670
Gosh, you've gotten even cuter.

205
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:18,880
You two know each other?

206
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:24,844
Oh, that's right!

207
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:32,477
Eat some more.

208
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:34,812
I don't want to. I'm full.

209
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:37,106
Gosh, you look so thin and weak.

210
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,276
-Eat. You should gain some weight.
-Who are you to tell me what to do?

211
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:45,448
-Stop acting up or else…
-Then what? What will you do?

212
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:52,914
In goes the airplane!

213
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:55,166
Damn, you're childish!

214
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,460
Then eat up already.

215
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:00,004
Baby, I'll be back soon.

216
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:03,382
-Geez, she's deeply sick.
-Hey, what about the red-white mask?

217
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:09,347
-You idiot.
-You find the bastard?

218
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,431
I'm not sure.

219
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:14,644
-I'll tell you if you treat me well.
-Geez. Hey!

220
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,437
But I'm a little busy right now.

221
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,486
-So did she find him or not?
-Who knows what she's thinking.

222
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,154
I'm curious.

223
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:27,740
What exactly is your relationship
with that crazy woman?

224
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:40,378
Let's swear to protect each other
no matter what.

225
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:43,339
Let's become mountain gods
and reunite again.

226
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:46,050
Hey, Cheon Moo-yeong!

227
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:53,307
Promise!

228
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:54,892
Promise.

229
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,657
Well, what is it?

230
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,993
It's something like a broken oath.

231
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:14,495
Eat, eat.

232
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,208
There's someone here to see you.

233
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,043
Who?

234
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,642
Ta-da.

235
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,270
What's with the flowers?

236
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,941
Well,

237
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:45,985
because those are your favorite flowers.

238
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:47,862
You remember that too?

239
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:50,198
You are the Cheon Moo-yeong I know.

240
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,035
I have a ton of questions.

241
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,914
Rumor says that
Taluipa removed you from your post

242
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:00,166
and turned you into stone.

243
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:05,755
-It's true.
-But the old hag liked you the most.

244
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,090
So, why?

245
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:12,678
-I did something deserving it.
-You were punished for hundreds of years?

246
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:15,181
I turned into stone and was imprisoned!

247
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,061
I survived, thinking of you.

248
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:22,146
Our beautiful Hong-joo.

249
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:28,861
I hoped that you'd be living happily,
with your seven younger brother owls.

250
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:31,781
Perhaps you don't know.

251
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:38,412
My parents and siblings…

252
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:40,665
all starved to death.

253
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,418
When I got home, they were corpses.

254
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:47,964
After all that pestering that
I become a mountain god to support them…

255
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:55,263
Those incompetent and weak, yet nice,
can't even protect their own.

256
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:57,807
I'm sorry.

257
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,852
I wasn't there for you as a friend.

258
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:03,312
Nothing to be sorry about.

259
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:05,940
Let me just ask one thing.

260
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:09,902
You and Lee Yeon.
What happened between you two?

261
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:12,363
How did you,
who couldn't even kill an ant,

262
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:14,615
think to stab Yeon's brother?

263
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:20,955
Because I want Yeon
to feel the same pain I felt.

264
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:24,375
Like when I lost my only brother.

265
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:27,128
What's this about?

266
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:30,006
Yeon is on his way.

267
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:36,220
Your identity is a secret, no?

268
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:39,557
I want to check something.

269
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:50,067
It was you who wanted to see me?

270
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,570
You left like that earlier,

271
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:55,781
but what's with the flowers, huh?

272
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:17,345
What's going on?

273
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:20,598
It suddenly became dark.

274
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:23,809
What are you doing?

275
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:31,275
I can't…

276
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:40,493
Hong-joo. Where are you, Hong-joo?

277
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:42,244
What's wrong with him?

278
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:45,748
Yeon.

279
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:48,417
Yeon, what's wrong? You okay?

280
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:50,711
Hong-joo. Why am I like this?

281
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:52,671
What's happening to me?

282
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:02,890
What's going on?

283
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:04,558
Did something happen?

284
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:06,769
Someone's here.

285
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:08,437
Who?

286
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:14,402
The flower merchant.

287
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,030
Hong-joo.

288
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:20,658
What's happening to me, huh?

289
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:25,996
Let's go. I'll take you home.

290
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:41,011
You still…

291
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,347
have feelings for Lee Yeon.

292
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,266
Like back then.

293
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:47,059
And until now.

294
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,353
Perhaps I should have checked.

295
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,617
My eyes… What's wrong with my eyes?

296
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:05,578
Lord Lee Yeon, take a deep breath.

297
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,083
Open your eyes.

298
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:15,588
Do you see anything?

299
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:19,884
No, I don't.

300
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:22,219
The lighter, please.

301
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:27,224
I'll check your pupil reflex.

302
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:36,525
Well…

303
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:38,444
There's no response.

304
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:41,572
What do you mean?

305
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:45,326
Tell me!

306
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:47,786
I think you've lost your sight.

307
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:54,001
Look at me, look at me.

308
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:55,294
That girl from last night.

309
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:58,088
What?

310
00:29:58,756 --> 00:29:59,757
It's that thing.

311
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,842
It all started after I met its eyes.

312
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:13,646
What's that bell?

313
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,607
Someone gave it,
saying I did something nice.

314
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,359
You used to be human?

315
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:22,446
My name.

316
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,031
Guess my name.

317
00:30:25,074 --> 00:30:26,075
Name?

318
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:31,413
What does that matter?
When you're so special right now.

319
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:33,707
No! The nine-tailed fox knows!

320
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,210
-What?
-What are you trying to do?

321
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:39,255
Don't look! You can't make eye contact.

322
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:43,425
Who is that kid?

323
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,719
I am Saetani.

324
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:48,973
Saetani?

325
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,475
A monster created by a Yeommae ritual.

326
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,060
Go inside.

327
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:55,271
YEOMMAE - STARVING A CHILD
TO PRACTICE DIVINATION

328
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:02,611
Have you lost your mind?

329
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,823
You released a cursed monster
into this world.

330
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:07,992
How is Yeon doing? Is he distressed?

331
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:10,869
Is he writhing in the dark?

332
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:12,746
Is this what you wanted?

333
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,957
Lee Yeon must be punished
for breaking the oath.

334
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,041
The oath?

335
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,172
We swore to protect each other
even if we died.

336
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:25,009
But one guy falls for a human
and abandons his duties.

337
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:28,053
The other commits a heinous crime
to have been turned into stone

338
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:30,598
at Taluipa's hands
who was like a mother to him.

339
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:35,686
There was no one by my side.

340
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:37,771
Even when I needed you guys.

341
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,316
-Hong-joo--
-Finally.

342
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,027
The three of us have finally reunited.

343
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:46,989
But why is it like this?

344
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:50,075
Come to me.

345
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:52,286
Whatever you want,

346
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:55,164
I'll give it to you.

347
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:04,423
Just in case,
try to minimize eye irritation.

348
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,426
I wonder what that girl was?

349
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:11,013
I don't know about that,
but it's a powerful kind of curse.

350
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:15,434
Just looking at it puts a curse on you?
I've never heard of a demon like that.

351
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:16,852
That's not the problem.

352
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,229
Who would think to deliver a curse to me

353
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:23,442
in the year 1938,
to the exact address of Myoyeongak?

354
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:25,486
Red-white mask.

355
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:28,697
Shin-ju, fix my eyes.

356
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:30,366
I don't have time for this.

357
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:33,285
I'll try to find a way.

358
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:35,287
Give him porridge. He'll need the energy.

359
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:52,388
You still hate me, huh?

360
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:57,309
I kept you with me for selfish reasons,

361
00:32:57,393 --> 00:32:59,228
but you're confused as to why,

362
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:00,896
and whether you can even trust me.

363
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:04,733
You think my eyes haven't been
watching you these past few days?

364
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:06,694
You're not the Lee Yeon I know.

365
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:09,822
That's the only reason I kept you alive.

366
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:11,031
No.

367
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:13,325
You needed family.

368
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,203
Whether I'm real or fake.

369
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:20,708
Shut up. I could kill you right here,
if I wanted to.

370
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:24,545
I've met many monsters throughout my life.

371
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:29,091
Many times have I barely survived death,
but not once was I ever afraid.

372
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,219
I'm a little afraid now.

373
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:39,351
-You're afraid?
-I can't protect anyone like this.

374
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:43,522
-Even if something happens to you.
-Quit the older brother act.

375
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,607
No matter what others say,
I'm your older brother.

376
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:49,153
-I fed, dressed, and raised you.
-So what?

377
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:50,612
Want me to repay kindness?

378
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:53,532
-Give it. I'll eat it myself.
-Fine. Here.

379
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:18,974
Geez, I can't watch this any longer.
Just give it to me.

380
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:21,769
Say, "Ah."

381
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,021
Geez.

382
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:26,440
Again.

383
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:31,820
Gosh, be a little nicer. I'm a patient.

384
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,577
You happy?

385
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:40,412
Damn, it tastes bad.

386
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:44,208
-Next time, bring mung bean porridge.
-Who do you think you are?

387
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:52,466
Where are you going in that state?

388
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:56,970
The red-white mask will come.

389
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,973
-Go on.
-Think about it.

390
00:35:00,057 --> 00:35:03,185
I can't see a thing.
Would you miss this opportunity?

391
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,312
So, you'll do what without sight?

392
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:10,567
I have to try something.
I should at least walk on my own.

393
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:16,198
Wait, stop there.

394
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:17,324
Five steps to the left.

395
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:24,832
One, two, three, four, five.

396
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:26,542
There, now turn right.

397
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:30,879
That's a flower bed, you idiot.

398
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,465
Oh, a flower bed.

399
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,226
Nine.

400
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:46,270
Ten.

401
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,356
Seventeen.

402
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:54,903
Seventeen steps from the flower bed.

403
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:02,786
What's this?

404
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:05,080
-It's gangjeong. Have one.
-Gangjeong?

405
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:07,374
Shit-- What's this? It smells weird.

406
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:10,711
-It's dog poop.
-Hey, you prick! Seriously!

407
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:13,130
Where are you?

408
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:15,716
Wait till you get caught. Okay?

409
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:18,719
Hey, damn it! You little--

410
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:22,264
What's so exciting?

411
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,142
-Where are you?
-Over here, here!

412
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:29,605
I, Sho Tawara,

413
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:35,027
and my wife Seiko, a native noble.

414
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:42,326
Today, we have dedicated two airplanes
to the Imperial Forces,

415
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:45,454
and it burns our heart with patriotism.

416
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:50,083
The peace of the 24 million subjects
is solely attributable

417
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:52,377
to the brave Imperial Forces

418
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:55,505
and His Majesty, the emperor!

419
00:36:58,258 --> 00:36:59,509
What do you think?

420
00:36:59,593 --> 00:37:02,054
It's for when he receives
his Order of Military Merit.

421
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,723
It's nice, but at the end…

422
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:10,062
"Long live the Emperor!
Long live the Empire of Japan!"

423
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:13,023
How about adding this in?

424
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:14,816
Perfect!

425
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,068
How wonderful!

426
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:22,658
Those who listen will naturally
have their patriotic spirits soar.

427
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:28,080
-If it's two planes, how much is it?
-Ten thousand won.

428
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:30,165
10,000 WON AT THE TIME

429
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,084
IS APPROXIMATELY
FIVE BILLION WON NOW

430
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:35,629
The Government-General is calling.

431
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:38,548
-Oh, please go ahead. Yes.
-Yes.

432
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:48,392
Why don't you lighten up
on a glorious day like this?

433
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:53,271
People might see you
and think you're an independence activist.

434
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:00,487
I'm the only daughter of Sho Tawara,
who's being awarded by the Emperor.

435
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:03,991
People might hear you
and think you've gone mad.

436
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:07,619
When you're this sharp,

437
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:10,205
I find it very charming.

438
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,759
Keep an eye on her.

439
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:27,806
See what she's been up to
with that pretty face.

440
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:29,975
You have a vague idea, no?

441
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:32,811
If I'm going to keep up the human act
and devour Joseon,

442
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,022
I need this family.

443
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:40,777
And I wish for my adorable new bride
to have not one speck of dirt on her.

444
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:49,828
-Lift your arms.
-Geez.

445
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:52,247
-Here we go.
-What's this?

446
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,876
Damn it, you freak.
Do you really want to die?

447
00:38:58,211 --> 00:38:59,588
-Let's have an exorcism.
-What?

448
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:02,632
Exorcism? Will it work?

449
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:06,636
Well, it's a traditional method
but it'll get rid of most curses.

450
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,930
Give me your eye mask.
I need something of yours.

451
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:10,015
Sure.

452
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:18,940
-We'll be back soon!
-Be careful.

453
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:26,490
Oh, gosh.

454
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:53,683
Grapes?

455
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:57,437
When I think about my childhood,
I still smell grapes.

456
00:39:57,521 --> 00:39:59,689
Geez, that damn temple.

457
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:02,234
It teemed with grapevines,
hence it's name, Temple Vino.

458
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:06,279
For us, it's our hometown and orphanage.

459
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:09,574
What's so great about a mountain god?

460
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:11,993
We put our lives on the line for it.

461
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:17,165
Sometimes I want to turn back time.

462
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:22,045
So you don't have a human that
you can't get over.

463
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:26,299
Back to when you didn't have Shin-ju
or your brother.

464
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:29,803
When all we had were…

465
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:33,223
each other to rely on.

466
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,353
But we are no longer
those children from that time.

467
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,775
I hope your sight never returns.

468
00:40:44,693 --> 00:40:45,902
Why the sudden curse?

469
00:40:45,986 --> 00:40:48,280
Being the only one living
in the past irks me.

470
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:51,700
I'm dying to see you helpless without me.

471
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,619
You know that's not my thing.

472
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,040
Yeon.

473
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:03,253
I'm giving you a chance right now.

474
00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:06,256
A chance?

475
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:10,010
When you close your eyes,
you can see more than you think.

476
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:12,929
You must figure it out yourself.

477
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:15,098
What to look for.

478
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:17,809
What you missed with your eyes open.

479
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:22,689
You saw him.

480
00:41:23,565 --> 00:41:27,110
You saw what was behind
that red-white mask, didn't you?

481
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:30,155
-You saw him too.
-What?

482
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:33,158
Say the word,

483
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,494
and I might side with you.

484
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:39,080
Or else…

485
00:41:39,623 --> 00:41:41,917
I could be a worse enemy than him.

486
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,087
-Damn it. Let go of me.
-Answer me. Say you're mine.

487
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:48,381
-Why are you doing this?
-Because I like you.

488
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:57,849
Wrong.

489
00:41:57,933 --> 00:42:01,645
You just always have to get what you want.

490
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,439
You just can't stand it if you don't.

491
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,525
So, what's your answer?

492
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,946
A fox never betrays his mate.

493
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:13,531
That's my answer.

494
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:24,709
Jae-yoo.

495
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:29,381
Go spread some rumors
to the demons of Gyeongseong.

496
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:31,299
What sort of rumors?

497
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,136
That Lee Yeon went blind.

498
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:43,144
CLOSED TODAY

499
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:45,355
It's been so long since we last closed.

500
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:47,565
I might go to the bathhouse
and soak in the hot tub.

501
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:48,900
Really?

502
00:42:48,984 --> 00:42:51,778
But will it be all right?

503
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:53,613
Do we really leave the guest alone?

504
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:58,326
It's the Madame's orders.
And for us, that's the law.

505
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,023
Damn it.

506
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:34,946
Is-- Is there anyone out there?

507
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:37,240
Can I get some water?

508
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:40,493
Yes, sir. Did you need something?

509
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:43,079
Who are you? I've never heard your voice.

510
00:43:43,163 --> 00:43:45,623
They call me Sudol who carries firewood.

511
00:43:45,707 --> 00:43:49,002
-The gisaengs all went to the bathhouse.
-I see…

512
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:52,672
-Are you alone?
-Yes, sir.

513
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:58,553
-Give me a hand.
-Yes, sir.

514
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:04,017
Are you going someplace?

515
00:44:12,776 --> 00:44:14,402
Your name's Sudol, right?

516
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:16,613
And what do you do here?

517
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:19,199
I'm the guy who carries the firewood.

518
00:44:20,075 --> 00:44:21,159
Is that so?

519
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,244
How strange.

520
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:26,122
What do you mean, sir?

521
00:44:34,506 --> 00:44:36,591
Because you have the hands of a swordsman!

522
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:03,410
I'm guessing there are about 15 guys.
Who the hell are you all?

523
00:45:03,493 --> 00:45:07,580
You know how many demons you've killed
since working for Taluipa?

524
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:10,458
You think I'll keep track in my diary?

525
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:13,211
So much talk for a guy
who can't even use his eyes.

526
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:20,009
You think foxes only hunt with their eyes?

527
00:46:17,484 --> 00:46:20,028
Exorcism or whatever--
Must we do it at a place like this?

528
00:46:21,196 --> 00:46:23,156
It must be a path that humans frequent.

529
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:26,034
-What's with the red beans?
-To chase away ghosts.

530
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:28,036
You know they love rice cakes.

531
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,120
Go away!

532
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:34,876
What time is it?

533
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:40,173
-Five to midnight.
-It's almost time. Please, come in.

534
00:46:46,513 --> 00:46:49,807
-Lord Lee Yeon's hair, please.
-Here.

535
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:53,144
Please burn it at midnight.

536
00:46:53,228 --> 00:46:55,396
Don't forget to pour alcohol
north, east, west, and south.

537
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,732
Okay. For the millionth time.

538
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:01,778
From here on, you're on your own.

539
00:47:02,362 --> 00:47:03,988
Leave as soon as you're done.

540
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:06,866
Don't look back or talk until you arrive.

541
00:47:12,247 --> 00:47:13,873
-Don't ever look back!
-Just go.

542
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:20,064
-Get him!
-Why you--!

543
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:23,776
Jae-yoo.

544
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,238
Let's impair Yeon's hearing too.

545
00:48:27,322 --> 00:48:28,323
Yes, ma'am.

546
00:48:57,602 --> 00:48:58,770
Shit…

547
00:49:25,797 --> 00:49:27,298
How embarrassing. You running away?

548
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:33,137
Take this!

549
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:38,893
Get him!

550
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,280
Wait, stop there. Five steps to the left.

551
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,870
One, two, three, four…

552
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:00,373
Five!

553
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:05,002
It's here.

554
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:28,192
Now, both parties are equally in the dark.

555
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:35,908
Well, this is no fun.

556
00:50:52,008 --> 00:50:53,217
Are you going out?

557
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:58,181
Taluipa summoned me.
I killed a human yesterday.

558
00:51:00,308 --> 00:51:03,770
You sure you'll be okay,
leaving Yeon behind by himself?

559
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:07,190
Cook him up however you want.

560
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:11,027
Let's see what you've got.

561
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,309
If you feel like something's chasing you,
it's probably the creature.

562
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:46,020
Don't ever look back. Never.

563
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:50,316
It's a much more dangerous creature
than I'd expected.

564
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:53,319
I have a bad feeling.

565
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:57,114
At this rate, it'll catch me.

566
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:06,791
Where are you headed, boss?
Let's go together.

567
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,378
What's going on? Why are you
pretending not to know me?

568
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:14,549
No way--

569
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:16,968
Are you embarrassed that
I'm a rickshaw worker now?

570
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:22,014
Gosh, why aren't you saying anything?

571
00:52:23,558 --> 00:52:24,559
What?

572
00:52:26,435 --> 00:52:28,145
You mean, you have to go?

573
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,481
Get on, then.

574
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:57,633
MYOYEONGAK

575
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:02,972
Ta-da!

576
00:53:09,979 --> 00:53:11,731
Why did you buy so much?

577
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:15,067
You haven't smelled the ocean
in so long, no? Have one.

578
00:53:23,826 --> 00:53:26,621
-Does it taste good?
-Even better than crucian carp!

579
00:53:28,998 --> 00:53:31,459
Wait, but what's all this?

580
00:53:32,585 --> 00:53:33,586
It's a gift.

581
00:53:33,669 --> 00:53:35,630
Remember the brothers from a few days ago?

582
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:38,132
Oh, the older one? Lord Lee Yeon?

583
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,842
No, the younger one.

584
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:41,844
Lee Rang?

585
00:53:41,928 --> 00:53:43,054
So his name is Rang.

586
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:46,015
Don't do it, Yeo-hee.
Don't get close to him.

587
00:53:46,098 --> 00:53:48,184
-Is he a bad guy?
-A very…

588
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:52,563
He has a lot of wounds.

589
00:53:52,647 --> 00:53:55,191
He has one human parent, just like you.

590
00:53:56,484 --> 00:53:59,528
You know very well
about those neither human nor demon,

591
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:02,323
and the path they end up taking.

592
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:08,329
But it was love at first sight.

593
00:54:09,205 --> 00:54:10,373
I…

594
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:13,918
I'm going to love that guy.

595
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:20,341
Ma'am.

596
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:30,851
There will be a bomb coming in
from Shanghai soon.

597
00:54:32,645 --> 00:54:34,730
I'll leave the back door open.

598
00:54:34,814 --> 00:54:36,190
Oh, what's the password?

599
00:54:40,653 --> 00:54:43,239
Do-re-mi-re-do.

600
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:48,369
-Be careful.
-You too, ma'am.

601
00:54:57,044 --> 00:55:02,341
OBOK BOUTIQUE

602
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,150
Was the exorcism a success?

603
00:55:33,205 --> 00:55:34,623
At last,

604
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,793
Yeon is all alone.

605
00:55:50,056 --> 00:55:51,766
Hey, what's this?

606
00:55:52,475 --> 00:55:53,809
Wow!

607
00:55:53,893 --> 00:55:58,647
Isn't this the castella from Jingogae
that sells out like hot cakes?

608
00:55:58,731 --> 00:56:00,441
Whoa, amazing!

609
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:07,406
The bread is as fluffy as cotton candy!

610
00:56:13,746 --> 00:56:16,624
Hey, Hong-joo!
Why do you keep killing people!

611
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:20,044
Why can't I kill them? They'll die anyway.

612
00:56:20,961 --> 00:56:25,257
-You were a mountain god once!
-Why are you so tough on me?

613
00:56:25,341 --> 00:56:27,885
Yeon killed tons of soldiers,
but why go easy on him?

614
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:30,262
That's because the Yeon in Myoyeongak is--

615
00:56:30,346 --> 00:56:31,639
Hey!

616
00:56:34,683 --> 00:56:35,684
Yeon is what?

617
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:42,399
What is it? What aren't you telling me?

618
00:56:42,483 --> 00:56:44,902
So much talk for someone
who's to be punished for murder!

619
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:46,070
Send her to Ice Hell.

620
00:56:46,946 --> 00:56:49,949
Hong-joo is getting old too.
Why not send her somewhere warm?

621
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:54,995
Let's go.

622
00:56:57,164 --> 00:56:58,541
Oh, that's right.

623
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:01,544
-You know Moo-yeong is here, right?
-What?

624
00:57:02,378 --> 00:57:04,588
What do you mean? Moo-yeong is alive?

625
00:57:06,382 --> 00:57:09,051
-You weren't the one who saved him?
-Hong-joo.

626
00:57:09,677 --> 00:57:13,514
Why do you think I turned him,
who I treated like my own, into stone?

627
00:57:15,224 --> 00:57:20,688
He is the one who annihilated everything
from the mountain he ruled

628
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:21,897
with his own hands.

629
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:24,942
There's no way.

630
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:28,529
Why would he do something like that?

631
00:57:30,573 --> 00:57:34,034
Do you think I would've forgiven him,
after all he's done?

632
00:57:36,579 --> 00:57:37,580
No.

633
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:39,498
You would never.

634
00:57:40,082 --> 00:57:41,500
Take her away.

635
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:58,809
Who in the world saved him?

636
00:58:00,311 --> 00:58:02,062
And for what?

637
00:58:08,152 --> 00:58:09,153
Rang.

638
00:58:10,321 --> 00:58:11,322
Shin-ju!

639
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:12,948
Anyone there?

640
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:26,879
Rang's pocket watch.

641
00:58:29,924 --> 00:58:31,508
And Shin-ju's handkerchief.

642
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:37,389
Damn it.

643
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:47,524
For goodness' sake!

644
00:58:51,946 --> 00:58:52,947
Is anyone there?

645
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:57,284
Anybody is welcome, so just help me.

646
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:00,746
Please, please!

647
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:04,500
Please.

648
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:07,878
Who are you?

649
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:12,800
A kid?

650
00:59:14,093 --> 00:59:15,719
Can you read this letter for me?

651
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:20,432
"Your brother and Shin-ju are dying.

652
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:22,851
If you wish to save them,

653
00:59:22,935 --> 00:59:25,437
come to the hermitage
at the east foot of Mt. Bukhan.

654
00:59:25,521 --> 00:59:27,523
I'll give you an hour.

655
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:30,401
You know who I am, don't you?"

656
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:34,321
Red-white mask, you bastard.

657
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:39,451
Hey, kid. Please help me out.

658
00:59:39,535 --> 00:59:42,246
-Carry me.
-Sure.

659
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:48,961
-This way.
-This way?

660
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:55,801
Help!

661
00:59:55,884 --> 00:59:57,845
Please save us!

662
00:59:57,928 --> 00:59:59,638
Is anyone there?

663
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:01,682
Please save us!

664
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:06,395
If they wanted to save us,
would they have put us in here?

665
01:00:06,478 --> 01:00:08,939
We're about to die.
I must try whatever I can, no?

666
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:10,774
Untie the rope first.

667
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:21,076
I can't do it by force.

668
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:30,502
-Lord Lee Yeon will come to save us.
-The guy who can't even see? You wish.

669
01:00:30,586 --> 01:00:34,923
Even if he loses all his hands and feet,
Lord Lee Yeon will come to save you.

670
01:00:35,007 --> 01:00:36,467
And you will do the same for him.

671
01:00:37,051 --> 01:00:38,427
How would you know that?

672
01:00:39,094 --> 01:00:41,263
Stop talking like you know me.

673
01:00:41,347 --> 01:00:45,893
I can't explain it, but I just know.
I know how kind you are.

674
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:47,853
You even bought me a kimchi fridge!

675
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:51,815
Who the hell are you guys?
Is that also a secret?

676
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:55,110
After living like strangers
for hundreds of years, suddenly--

677
01:00:56,028 --> 01:00:58,238
you both enter my life,
pretending to be nice.

678
01:00:58,322 --> 01:01:00,199
Cut it out. It's disgusting.

679
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:04,870
I think the water level is rising!

680
01:01:06,914 --> 01:01:08,082
Lord Lee Yeon!

681
01:01:10,209 --> 01:01:11,585
Lord Lee Yeon!

682
01:01:12,961 --> 01:01:14,171
Thank you, kid.

683
01:01:17,883 --> 01:01:19,468
The sound of a moktak.

684
01:01:21,804 --> 01:01:22,805
This way.

685
01:01:38,821 --> 01:01:40,447
It's the stride of an adult man.

686
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,972
It's not human. It's him!

687
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:33,792
Damn it.

688
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:39,631
He's missing on purpose.

689
01:02:40,299 --> 01:02:43,469
He's messing with me,
like we're playing hare and hounds.

690
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:02,070
Shit.

691
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:05,032
If only I could see…

692
01:03:05,866 --> 01:03:07,493
If only I could see!

693
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:22,007
You know me, don't you?

694
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:24,301
How do you know me?

695
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:26,595
Why the hell are you doing this to me?

696
01:03:28,013 --> 01:03:29,014
Take it.

697
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:38,690
I don't know what it is,
but it's all my fault.

698
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:43,529
I have no intention of fighting you.
So, please…

699
01:03:43,612 --> 01:03:46,281
Just spare Rang and Shin-ju, please.

700
01:03:54,957 --> 01:03:56,500
That's a lightning rod for you.

701
01:03:59,253 --> 01:04:01,797
Damn it. Geez.

702
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:06,051
Just a little more!

703
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:14,977
We got it! We got it!

704
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:16,645
We got it.

705
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:18,772
What?

706
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:22,025
What's that rope?

707
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:36,039
No. No, no!

708
01:04:36,123 --> 01:04:38,834
At this rate, we'll both die.

709
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,128
What do we do?

710
01:04:41,962 --> 01:04:43,338
Lord Lee Rang!

711
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:52,931
Lord Lee Rang!

712
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:10,449
Rang!

713
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:12,659
Shin-ju!

714
01:05:21,877 --> 01:05:23,754
Please return my eyes.

715
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:26,214
Please give me back my sight. Please!

716
01:05:32,512 --> 01:05:34,598
Guess who.

717
01:05:38,602 --> 01:05:41,063
This voice. Are you the kid from earlier?

718
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:44,274
-No way. Are you--
-Saetani.

719
01:05:44,358 --> 01:05:47,444
It was you. You took my eyes!

720
01:05:47,527 --> 01:05:49,988
-Give them back!
-You broke your promise first!

721
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,912
Guess my name.

722
01:05:56,995 --> 01:06:00,040
Your name? How the hell would I know?

723
01:06:00,123 --> 01:06:01,875
-Die!
-Where are you?

724
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:05,045
There you are.

725
01:06:10,342 --> 01:06:11,593
The sound of bells.

726
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,263
This sound…

727
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:25,065
This is the forest I used to rule.

728
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:36,118
The carp you just saved
is a descendant of the owner of this pond.

729
01:06:37,369 --> 01:06:39,162
I'll give you this as a reward.

730
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:50,424
What's this?

731
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:52,342
I'll grant you a wish, just once.

732
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:56,680
What's your name?

733
01:06:57,597 --> 01:06:58,724
My name is…

734
01:07:01,268 --> 01:07:02,436
I am…

735
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:11,278
Tell me.

736
01:07:12,821 --> 01:07:14,406
Say it. What is your name?

737
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:17,159
Tell me. Tell me right now!

738
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:19,661
Say it!

739
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:39,723
I'm hungry.

740
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:42,601
-We're almost home. Hang in there.
-Okay.

741
01:08:05,332 --> 01:08:06,458
I'll go with this child.

742
01:08:11,546 --> 01:08:15,425
I don't want to go, Sis.

743
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:17,719
I'm scared.

744
01:08:23,058 --> 01:08:26,311
Let's swap our clothes.

745
01:08:35,904 --> 01:08:37,572
Don't go.

746
01:08:43,662 --> 01:08:45,330
Sis…

747
01:08:56,383 --> 01:08:58,093
I want to go home.

748
01:09:00,011 --> 01:09:01,680
I'm thirsty.

749
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:04,933
I don't want to die.

750
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:09,271
Please save me, mountain god.

751
01:09:10,772 --> 01:09:12,941
I shouldn't have swapped clothes with her.

752
01:09:14,818 --> 01:09:16,027
I hate you all.

753
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:21,449
My father, my sister, and the gods.

754
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:25,036
I want to go home.

755
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:29,499
I don't want to die.

756
01:09:30,292 --> 01:09:31,501
Mountain god.

757
01:09:31,585 --> 01:09:34,421
Help me. Please help me.

758
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:37,382
Please save me. Save me, please.

759
01:09:37,465 --> 01:09:40,635
Please, sir, mountain god. Please.

760
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:43,346
Please save me.

761
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:46,516
Help me. Please help me…

762
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:53,148
Why didn't you come?

763
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:54,941
By then, I was no longer…

764
01:09:55,984 --> 01:09:57,944
a mountain god.

765
01:10:01,114 --> 01:10:04,326
I abandoned my duty to save a woman.

766
01:10:04,409 --> 01:10:06,578
Now you can't save anyone!

767
01:10:14,085 --> 01:10:15,378
I'm sorry…

768
01:10:16,463 --> 01:10:17,756
for being too late.

769
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:20,091
I'm so sorry.

770
01:10:23,094 --> 01:10:24,512
My name is…

771
01:10:31,603 --> 01:10:33,647
I remembered your name.

772
01:10:34,606 --> 01:10:35,690
My name?

773
01:10:36,316 --> 01:10:37,359
Your name…

774
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:41,029
"Lea," as in Azalea flowers.

775
01:10:43,949 --> 01:10:45,033
…is Lea.

776
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:47,661
As in Azaleas.

777
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:49,496
My name…

778
01:10:50,038 --> 01:10:51,498
is Lea.

779
01:11:28,535 --> 01:11:31,037
Nothing can lock you up now.

780
01:11:31,705 --> 01:11:33,581
You don't have to live as a Saetani.

781
01:11:33,665 --> 01:11:35,583
I'm not Saetani.

782
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:39,879
I am Lea.

783
01:11:39,963 --> 01:11:42,549
Yes, you're Lea.

784
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:50,598
You were scared, weren't you?
Dying in there, all alone.

785
01:11:57,397 --> 01:11:58,982
In your next life,

786
01:11:59,733 --> 01:12:01,151
be born as a normal child.

787
01:12:02,152 --> 01:12:04,029
Whether a shaman or a Saetani,

788
01:12:04,112 --> 01:12:06,781
let's not live as someone else's object.

789
01:12:09,993 --> 01:12:11,161
You did well.

790
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:14,289
Enduring in this small body.

791
01:12:18,043 --> 01:12:21,796
Thanks for making my wish come true.

792
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:27,761
Your brother is in the west well.

793
01:13:04,506 --> 01:13:05,548
Shin-ju.

794
01:13:06,049 --> 01:13:07,425
You're almost up.

795
01:13:10,637 --> 01:13:12,180
Shin-ju.

796
01:13:13,431 --> 01:13:15,433
Are you okay? What about Rang?

797
01:13:16,101 --> 01:13:17,227
He still in there.

798
01:14:30,842 --> 01:14:36,890
ICE HELL

799
01:14:49,402 --> 01:14:51,946
So the old hag didn't save Moo-yeong.

800
01:14:53,865 --> 01:14:58,661
But Moo-yeong and Yeon showed up
in Gyeongseong on the same day…

801
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:04,250
You two…

802
01:15:05,877 --> 01:15:07,378
What the hell are you?

803
01:15:17,555 --> 01:15:19,682
Rang, can you recognize me?

804
01:15:20,808 --> 01:15:22,101
Oh, what a relief.

805
01:15:38,243 --> 01:15:40,912
It's still fun messing with Yeon.

806
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:45,917
Yeon.

807
01:15:48,378 --> 01:15:50,421
You'll be stuck in the past forever…

808
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:56,219
seeing everything you cared for
die before your eyes.

809
01:15:57,971 --> 01:16:01,975
That day, I made my first bucket list.

810
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:03,977
Can you move your legs?

811
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:08,523
Even if I were to leave,
I'd wish Rang had someone by his side.

812
01:16:10,775 --> 01:16:12,568
And at the very least,

813
01:16:12,652 --> 01:16:14,904
I won't allow something
like the red-white mask live

814
01:16:16,281 --> 01:16:18,366
in an era they're living in.

815
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:33,214
TALE OF THE NINE TAILED

816
01:16:57,113 --> 01:16:59,490
Red-white mask, who is it?

817
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:02,744
-He knows me, no?
-Shush.

818
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:05,538
You guys have already drawn me
into your dog fight.

819
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:06,998
The item revives the dead,

820
01:17:07,081 --> 01:17:09,208
when you measure
the length and width of a corpse.

821
01:17:09,292 --> 01:17:11,169
-Baby.
-Let's knock it out.

822
01:17:11,252 --> 01:17:12,295
Hey, it's damp.

823
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:14,380
-Is this human?
-Get him!

824
01:17:14,464 --> 01:17:15,965
Isn't it a demon in disguise?

825
01:17:16,549 --> 01:17:18,801
-What's your ideal type?
-Someone stronger than me.

826
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:21,679
Why did you come to this era?

827
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:23,890
You think I'm fake?

828
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:26,392
I may have to kill one of them
with my own hands.

829
01:17:26,476 --> 01:17:27,810
Please, don't go.

830
01:17:29,937 --> 01:17:32,940
