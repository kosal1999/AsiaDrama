1
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,974
TALE OF THE NINE TAILED

2
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,350
Cheon Moo-yeong?

3
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:03,606
-Is it really you?
-Yes, it's me.

4
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,941
-How are you--
-Alive?

5
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:11,906
Cut the crap. Moo-yeong is dead.
I saw it with my own eyes.

6
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:14,950
Who exactly are you?

7
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:18,829
It's me.

8
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:21,749
Your friend, Moo-yeong.

9
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:29,590
This is proof that
the three of us are one.

10
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:35,012
Whoever betrays this pact
dies at my hands.

11
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,514
What if I lose it?

12
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:39,850
I'll feed you deer poop.

13
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:43,813
-Deer poop, deer poop, deer poop--
-Hey!

14
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,732
How do you have that?

15
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:52,863
Because I don't want to eat deer poop.

16
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,493
-No way.
-I missed you.

17
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:11,632
Are you red-white mask?

18
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,301
What do you mean?

19
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,518
You haven't changed at all.
You and your temper.

20
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,103
Who are you?

21
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,192
The Governor-General has me as a target.

22
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:34,363
I won't be able to hide my identity
for much longer.

23
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:37,950
Please punish me!
My brother did this because of me--

24
00:02:38,868 --> 00:02:42,621
No, I put you in danger, ma'am.

25
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:44,206
Don't cry.

26
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:48,669
A gisaeng must become not a flower,
but a weed in times like this.

27
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,758
Don't let the pesticides phase you.

28
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,263
I promise I will.

29
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,853
Jae Yoo, keep an eye
on the Governor-General.

30
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,105
And…

31
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:10,649
Don't get hurt.

32
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:12,902
Yes, ma'am. I'll do as you say.

33
00:03:22,328 --> 00:03:26,332
What will happen to Myoyeongak now?

34
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,792
Run the business as if nothing happened.

35
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,670
I will protect Myoyeongak.

36
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,175
Madame, you'd better come outside.

37
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:41,889
What the hell are you two doing?

38
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:08,499
Please stop.

39
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,428
What kind of fool do you two take me for?

40
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:04,346
Ryu Hong-joo.

41
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,182
Are you insane?

42
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:11,145
You better not do that.

43
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:16,275
-You've been struck on a vital point.
-By a mountain god's sword, at that.

44
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,073
What are you trying to do?

45
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,451
There are two of you.

46
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,912
And the opium addict in Manchuria
is the real one.

47
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:32,291
Damn, you caught me.

48
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,168
But…

49
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:40,674
-I'm the real Lee Yeon too.
-Except, you don't belong in this era.

50
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:53,979
He lost a lot of blood.

51
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:57,941
I wonder how you ever came back?

52
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:01,987
Taluipa never revives those she kills,
since she's all about principles.

53
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:07,451
I'm looking for answers too.
As to who awakened me.

54
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,914
As to what I am,
if I'm neither living nor dead.

55
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:18,962
What happened on the day
the four mountain gods were chosen?

56
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:22,341
Tell me! What the hell did you do
to ruin our friendship?

57
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:24,176
I killed…

58
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,971
Moo-yeong's older brother.

59
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:31,433
That's insane.

60
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,399
But…

61
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,529
I don't regret doing it.

62
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:48,742
Shut your mouth.

63
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,631
I can't die here.

64
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,596
I must go back.

65
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:13,892
-He's out of breath.
-What will it be?

66
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:15,978
The only one who can save him…

67
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,107
is you.

68
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:36,957
EPISODE 6

69
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,709
HANGMYEONOK NOODLES

70
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,587
I think they're closed.
Shall we go somewhere else?

71
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,923
No. I eat where I want to eat.

72
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,181
Bring me two bowls of naengmyeon.

73
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:55,309
We're closed. No more customers.

74
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:00,814
I want naengmyeon.

75
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,671
You're full eating like that?

76
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,049
I'm full.

77
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:30,969
Men like mysterious women.

78
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,846
Women who eat as little as birds

79
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,849
and don't even go to the toilet.

80
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:41,980
Why? Is there something on my face?

81
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,777
You're a curiosity.

82
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:50,822
I am?

83
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:53,992
A sales girl who turns out
to be a mermaid in disguise.

84
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:58,205
A half-blood with weak legs
who's really a master of destruction.

85
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:01,041
-Master of destruction?
-You destroy all with your singing.

86
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,378
Did you inherit your voice
from your mother?

87
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,590
I hate my voice.

88
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:12,469
I only sing to make people happy.

89
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,055
But I do that sometimes.

90
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:18,100
Quit complaining. That's a blessing.

91
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:22,229
You have the power
to fight the world and protect yourself.

92
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,648
Is that so?

93
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:28,902
Then I will protect you.

94
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,615
Why would you protect me?

95
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:37,244
Because you still have
five more wishes to grant me.

96
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,331
Quite the woman of tenacity, huh?

97
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:45,002
Check, please.

98
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:06,106
-Go home.
-You're not dropping me off?

99
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:11,653
-Would that be another wish?
-No. I'll use it sparingly.

100
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,700
-Good night.
-Yeah.

101
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,543
OBOK BOUTIQUE

102
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:27,312
The one who did this to you…

103
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:30,857
is that nine-tailed fox?

104
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:31,942
Yes, sir.

105
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:36,196
It could disguise itself.
The Madame of Myoyeongak is one of them!

106
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,281
We must get rid of them now!

107
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:43,870
Lee Yeon.

108
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,624
How wonderful.

109
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:54,756
Joseon seems to be filled
with utilizable demons.

110
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:00,804
Expedite the work at the gold mines.

111
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:03,598
Give them the orders.

112
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,477
You will do nothing about Myoyeongak?

113
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:11,898
We are in the middle of war.
Military expansion takes priority.

114
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:16,361
As for us, we're going to the laboratory.

115
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:22,242
We have secured new Joseon demons
to be our prey.

116
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,411
No!

117
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,206
They are not prey.

118
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,088
They are new war weapons for the Empire!

119
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:37,799
Yes, sir.

120
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:48,602
Did you find anything?

121
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:52,355
-They won't be raiding Myoyeongak yet.
-And the Chief Commissioner?

122
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,609
I hear he's going to some laboratory
with his right-hand man.

123
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:59,446
-A laboratory? What's that?
-Well…

124
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,247
It's top secret, so I don't know much.

125
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:12,667
But there's a rumor that
the hostages there aren't human.

126
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,353
You're here.

127
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,732
Let me introduce you to our newest member.

128
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:41,363
Whoa! These are your other members?

129
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,615
Let's see the goods from Manchuria first.

130
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:49,412
This is what I picked up
from Gyeongseong Station?

131
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:52,541
-A real bomb?
-I'm sure you know.

132
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,919
Both importing and carrying bombs
is a serious crime.

133
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:59,005
So from now on,
we must protect each other.

134
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:04,135
Even if we get exposed,
I will claim that I did everything alone.

135
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,138
-Me too.
-Same here.

136
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:12,644
And we are
the Independence Volunteer Corps.

137
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:17,899
When's the date?

138
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,361
We will receive an order
from Manchuria soon.

139
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,197
Excuse me for a moment.

140
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:34,249
-Why are you here, sir?
-I'm the keeper of the Stream of the Dead.

141
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:37,544
I've witnessed infinite deaths,
but this has gone too far.

142
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:42,382
War, torture, and even forced labor.
These lives don't deserve such a fate.

143
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:43,883
Does Taluipa know about this?

144
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,220
She'd go berserk.
Not to get involved in human affairs.

145
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,097
It's a secret.

146
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,517
Well, Lord Lee Yeon doesn't know
I'm here either.

147
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:54,352
It's good to have you.

148
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,230
We are Joseon demons, after all.

149
00:14:57,314 --> 00:15:00,567
We can't have our country taken
on our watch, no?

150
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:04,654
You all are admirable, comrades.

151
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,477
Still have your talents, huh?

152
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,313
He'll be up in half a day.

153
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:40,357
Why are you saving him?

154
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:44,778
You said you died because of him, no?

155
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,448
I brought Yeon to the past
to restore everything…

156
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,869
-to its rightful place.
-"Rightful place"?

157
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,503
Both my family and the forest I ruled.

158
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,297
I intend to get them all back.

159
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,883
And to do so, I need him.

160
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:13,056
Because this one has something
that the one from this era doesn't.

161
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,100
And what's that?

162
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,020
You'll find out soon.

163
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:23,274
Does he know you're red-white mask?

164
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,319
Shush.

165
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:09,070
-Yeon, I'm scared.
-A starving demon lives in this forest.

166
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:13,825
The creature that feeds on humans
and animals, regardless!

167
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,456
-Hey, stop tormenting him.
-Fine.

168
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:24,919
-Taluipa should know we're gone by now.
-Let's go back now.

169
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:27,422
If we decided to run,
we must see it to the end.

170
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:29,174
Just show me everything you have.

171
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,976
You here to open a tavern or something?

172
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,395
I can't stand being hungry.

173
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:44,272
What's that?

174
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:48,109
-I should still study, you know.
-Geez, Cheon Moo-yeong.

175
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:51,321
You brought underwear?

176
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:54,449
I must have clean underwear,
no matter what.

177
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:56,493
Oh, and this.

178
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,330
Ta-da!

179
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,625
-Isn't that Taluipa's favorite comb?
-It's revenge for tormenting us.

180
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:20,350
This is proof that
the three of us are one.

181
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:25,772
Whoever betrays this pact
dies at my hands.

182
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,273
What if I lose it?

183
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:29,984
I'll feed you deer poop.

184
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:34,572
-Deer poop, deer poop, deer poop--
-Hey!

185
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:57,887
I'm sorry, Yeon.

186
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:02,684
To be honest,

187
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,646
I don't care
if you're from the past or future.

188
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,233
I'm going to protect you.

189
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,069
And Moo-yeong.

190
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:15,446
In my own way.

191
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,659
Even if we end up in shreds.

192
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,043
We're hiring new gisaengs?

193
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:30,753
At a time like this?

194
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,257
Myoyeongak is open
until Madame Ryu says otherwise.

195
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,341
Gosh.

196
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:39,304
-How many are there?
-We have six candidates.

197
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,056
Madame will decide after she sees them.

198
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:45,059
How old? Are they pretty?

199
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:48,688
She sure does hate the pretty ones,
except for Madame Ryu.

200
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:51,983
Shut it. You're not one of them.

201
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:57,030
-You! Stand guard and report back to me.
-Yes, miss.

202
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:17,675
-What is this?
-It's a kind of invitation.

203
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:22,347
Place this in an inconspicuous place,
and it'll come to you.

204
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,892
-If you want your body fixed, catch it.
-"It"?

205
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:29,228
That thing is-- Gosh, I'm sure being kind.

206
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:32,523
Come closer.

207
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,989
-How can something like that?
-Forget it, then.

208
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:45,370
-Never mind, sir.
-But can you even catch it in that state?

209
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:48,289
It doesn't have to be me
that catches it, no?

210
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,086
A guest is coming.

211
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:57,757
Yeon, this is a game fraught with danger.

212
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:00,385
So, please be my pawn.

213
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,460
Wow, so pretty.

214
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:49,183
How strange.

215
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:53,146
How come there are seven, and not six?

216
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:08,578
Honey?

217
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:30,349
-The ice melts in my mouth like snow.
-That's right!

218
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,103
This is what they call bingsu.
It's big in Gyeongseong nowadays!

219
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:37,273
You went out to eat this every night?

220
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,859
I mean, the lines are extremely long--

221
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,489
Since when did they sell bingsu
at a boutique?

222
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:48,993
Whatever schemes you're a part of,
you better do it in moderation.

223
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,205
Humans write their history. Not us.

224
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,248
But we're the gods of Joseon--

225
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:56,626
Was there ever a death without a story?

226
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:59,295
Joseon survived
amidst all those foreign invasions.

227
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,174
They'll survive this too.

228
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,846
Damn it! Those pricks are back?

229
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:10,973
Gosh, those darn petty gods!

230
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,601
This was our home for thousands of years!

231
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:15,978
-I'll let them have it!
-Off with those foreigners!

232
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:18,189
You're all dead meat!

233
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,357
TALUIPA MUST BE ENLIGHTENED!

234
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,735
Off with Taluipa for turning a blind eye
to the indigenous gods!

235
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:24,695
Off with Taluipa! Off with Taluipa!

236
00:23:27,532 --> 00:23:28,658
Sheesh.

237
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:31,911
TALUIPA MUST BE ENLIGHTENED!

238
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,538
Why those little…

239
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:41,629
Sir, please let us meet Taluipa!

240
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:45,424
Do you not know her temper?

241
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:48,845
-You'll be punished for this!
-Damn it!

242
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:52,473
-If I get punished, I'll get punished!
-It's the outsiders.

243
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:56,853
They're butchering our forests,
and destroying our totem poles!

244
00:23:56,936 --> 00:24:01,315
So many gods are lost out there.
We don't know if they're dead or alive!

245
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,609
You poor things.

246
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:15,163
Huh?

247
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:33,514
-You awake, babe?
-Huh?

248
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:39,770
You pierce me like a skewer,
and you're calling me "babe"?

249
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:43,232
-You're the one who used me all along.
-"Used" you?

250
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:45,359
You sure played hard to get for a fake.

251
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,945
You're all the same underneath.

252
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:49,906
Oh, shit!

253
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:53,951
-What'd you do while I was asleep, huh?
-Someone did do something…

254
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:57,914
But it wasn't me.

255
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,250
No way.

256
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,674
He really is Moo-yeong, huh?

257
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:11,677
He really came back to life.

258
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:16,557
I remember hearing a rumor.

259
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:20,603
That you passed the mountain god exam
without striking a single demon!

260
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,605
You just treated them? Why?

261
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,399
Well, to get in the easy way?

262
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:28,236
My gosh. "Get in easy"?

263
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:32,114
His blood is as rare as they come.
Once every hundreds of years.

264
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:35,743
Draw some of it for me before you go.
Or you can just sell it to me.

265
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:39,705
-For how much?
-At a bargain for being Yeon's buddy?

266
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:40,915
Wow.

267
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:44,669
You sure are a dead ringer for him.

268
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,797
We look nothing alike. Apologize.

269
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:49,966
Oh, Lord Lee Yeon!

270
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:52,176
Are you okay now?

271
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:55,680
Let's talk.

272
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:02,478
Still can't believe it?

273
00:26:04,105 --> 00:26:08,693
No, I believe that you are Moo-yeong.

274
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:13,948
But I need to know one thing.

275
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:16,617
Why did you come see me at this time?

276
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:18,286
And how did you find me?

277
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,621
Why do you think?

278
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:22,623
Well.

279
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:27,878
For this?

280
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:36,220
What's that?

281
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:40,016
I thought you might know better than me.

282
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:43,811
Now that makes me want to have it.

283
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:53,446
Just kidding. I don't need this stuff.

284
00:26:58,492 --> 00:26:59,577
How did you find me?

285
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:03,581
Half of my body…

286
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:10,963
is still no different from stone.

287
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:21,390
I don't know who revived me,
but Taluipa's curse is still with me.

288
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:28,314
I went looking for a cure
at the pawnshop for demons.

289
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:29,607
That's when I met them.

290
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:31,984
VICTIMS' CLUB
FOR DEMONS VICTIMIZED BY THE FOX

291
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:34,278
The raccoon couple?
Were those pricks released?

292
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:38,699
I heard about you from them,
and came straight here.

293
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:47,666
You are welcome, friend.

294
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:58,010
Why don't you go visit the old hag?
Ask her to return your body to normal.

295
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:00,805
She'll never forgive me.

296
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:03,349
The mountain god
who annihilated the forest he ruled.

297
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:09,063
-Why did you do it?
-To save my brother.

298
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,735
Even if it cost me everything I cared for.

299
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:23,202
Looking good, you two.

300
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:26,872
Go change into something nice.

301
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:30,126
-What for?
-Let's play, the three of us.

302
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:31,919
Just like our carefree old days.

303
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:35,506
Excuse me. Didn't you stab us yesterday?

304
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:37,007
Just do as I say.

305
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:38,968
We leave in an hour.

306
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:55,484
Will you come…

307
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:09,748
Become a star and fill this night

308
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:21,427
How did you do that?
You never learned the piano, no?

309
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,679
I don't know. I just pressed what I heard.

310
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,182
Rang, I think you might be a genius!

311
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:31,061
Well, they did say I was a fast learner
ever since I was little.

312
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:35,274
-So cute.
-I'm the boss of a bandit gang.

313
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:37,318
Wishes or not. I can quit, you know.

314
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:40,738
Let's keep going.

315
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:45,910
You know this song.

316
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:01,277
Someone there?

317
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,487
Who's there?

318
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:09,887
Gosh, you scared me!

319
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:15,768
-The cook said the paste tastes strange.
-Which paste?

320
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:18,062
Soybean, red pepper and soy.
So all of them.

321
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:31,116
-Disgusting!
-Yuck, huh?

322
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,079
It is true.
It tastes different, like it's gone bad.

323
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:38,290
They say pastes change taste
if trouble occurs in the house.

324
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:40,000
Don't say such things.

325
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:43,545
-Did it get cursed in the making?
-But we picked a lucky day.

326
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:45,756
PASTE WAS MADE ON A 'LUCKY DAY'
WITH CURSE PREVENTION RITUALS

327
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,758
-We had a proper ritual too.
-Then, what happened?

328
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:21,291
Is someone there?

329
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:27,005
Have you seen my ring?

330
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:31,593
Azulea? You lost your ring?

331
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,682
But how did you get under there?

332
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:39,977
Can you help me look for it?
It's special to me.

333
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:52,990
-Is this it?
-Let me see.

334
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:57,286
Just a little closer. Closer!

335
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:12,176
-Apricot! Azulea is--
-What about me?

336
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:16,138
Weren't you just below the floorboard?

337
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,723
What are you talking about?

338
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:21,977
Oh, dear.
You seeing delusions in broad daylight?

339
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:30,569
Thank you.

340
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:35,866
Let's go.

341
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:40,954
Here he goes again.

342
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,499
Okay, I'll go. I'll go.

343
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:47,085
I mean,
why dress up to watch a darn movie.

344
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,096
What the hell!

345
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,401
Why?

346
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,243
Will you guys be quiet?

347
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,164
You should've just given them!

348
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:45,769
-Are you crying?
-Don't start.

349
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:41,491
You don't need to know.

350
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:44,953
-What? What the--
-It's raining!

351
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:48,248
-Why is it suddenly raining? Damn it!
-Hey!

352
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:51,043
He gets so serious when he runs.

353
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:53,837
Well, he hates getting his fur wet.

354
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:58,800
How was it?
Seeing Yeon with your mask off?

355
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:05,390
He's still honest and wise,
yet filled with confidence.

356
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:08,352
All the things I liked about him.

357
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:22,407
-It's starting to rain heavily.
-Hey!

358
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,245
Let's share it.
I don't want you getting rained on.

359
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:28,997
Then your other arm will get wet.

360
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:32,334
You haven't changed at all.

361
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:35,712
Damn it! Hey, give me that!

362
00:37:35,796 --> 00:37:38,924
-Hey, Lee Yeon!
-Hey, come closer. Come, come.

363
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,385
We should share,
even if we all get a little wet.

364
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:42,928
He hasn't changed either.

365
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:59,820
"Both Cheol-su's and Yeong-hui's house
is 10km away from the bakery.

366
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:02,072
Cheol-su walked 5km per hour,

367
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:05,701
and Yeong-hui walked 3km per hour
to the bakery.

368
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:11,498
When should they each leave their house
if they were to meet at 2 p.m."

369
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:14,835
Let's go over what we learned previously.

370
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:18,213
What're they eating?
If it's gomboppang, I'm not going.

371
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:22,259
-It's castella.
-Gosh, I can't pass up on castella.

372
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:25,512
Is Cheol-su handsome?

373
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:28,432
He's young, handsome, owns a car,
and a cultural house.

374
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:32,019
Then, I can't go at 2 p.m.
I have to stop by the hair salon.

375
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:35,939
Is there anyone who solved the problem?

376
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:42,070
Cheol-su needs to leave at 12 p.m.
and Yeong-hui at 10:40 a.m.

377
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:43,989
-Correct!
-What?

378
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:45,991
You never went to school, right?

379
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,080
Shall we solve another problem?

380
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:56,126
"There are 40 male
and female employees at the bakery.

381
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:58,503
How many men work
at the bakery this year?"

382
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:00,338
Eighteen.

383
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,052
Correct. "How long did it take
Yeong-hui to get to the bakery?"

384
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:09,973
-Thirty-two minutes.
-Correct!

385
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:12,184
Wow!

386
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:16,646
-You have an aptitude for math.
-She's a genius.

387
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,236
Ms. Sunwoo.
I think the light's are going out.

388
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,866
Then let's call it a day,
and have some drinks instead?

389
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:29,117
-Yes!
-Yes!

390
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,497
-Juk Hyang, time for bed.
-Okay.

391
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:02,859
Cheers!

392
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,782
-Uh-oh.
-Huh?

393
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:12,244
-It's a blackout.
-Here we go again.

394
00:40:13,954 --> 00:40:15,872
It does this everyday.

395
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:18,250
-Drink this too.
-No, you have it.

396
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,918
-That's your loss.
-Oh.

397
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,045
Thank you, Apricot.

398
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:28,176
The corner game
is best for blackouts, right?

399
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,386
What's a corner game?

400
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:32,139
It's a game of call.
To a ghost living in corners.

401
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:37,644
She thinks the ghost will tell her
about her future husband.

402
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:43,108
-It sounds fun.
-Shall we give it a try? Let's do it!

403
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:50,157
First, say your name out loud
to tell it that you're playing the game.

404
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,200
Then, say it backwards to end it.

405
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:55,203
To start, you say Eun-ho.
To end, you say Ho-eun.

406
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:58,790
When the person behind you taps your back,
you move to the next corner.

407
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:03,420
So we're just going around in circles?
It sounds boring.

408
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:09,384
We'll continue until someone doesn't move,
because that will be the ghost.

409
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,886
The most important thing.

410
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:13,054
Don't ever talk, while playing the game.

411
00:41:14,014 --> 00:41:15,932
Let's begin. Azulea!

412
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:17,434
Eun-ho.

413
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:19,769
-Apricot.
-Orchid.

414
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:32,717
What's this?

415
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:36,346
One.

416
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:38,348
Two.

417
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:41,393
Three.

418
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:43,603
Four.

419
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:45,981
Five?

420
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,276
There are five people in the room.

421
00:42:50,694 --> 00:42:52,153
Can't we just stop now?

422
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:54,739
I'm scared.

423
00:42:56,866 --> 00:43:00,120
It wasn't me!
There's someone else in this room!

424
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:03,581
Turn the light on!

425
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:12,382
-Huh?
-Ms. Sunwoo?

426
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:16,261
-Ms. Sunwoo!
-She disappeared.

427
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:18,763
She's gone!

428
00:43:29,441 --> 00:43:32,861
Hong-joo, do you remember
when Yeon fell in the toilet?

429
00:43:34,446 --> 00:43:36,323
Geez, that's out of the blue!

430
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:40,076
Of course, I remember.
We were playing hide-and-seek blindfolded.

431
00:43:41,036 --> 00:43:42,454
You pulled him out, Moo-yeong.

432
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:46,416
Nothing could make you cry,
but you wept through the night.

433
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:49,711
Gosh, you pricks.
Stop laughing at someone's painful past.

434
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:52,630
I've become a germaphobe
since that day, okay?

435
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:56,551
Damn.

436
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,263
What happened to Black bear?

437
00:44:00,347 --> 00:44:03,558
He was so tactless and quiet,
I thought he'd never be a mountain god.

438
00:44:04,726 --> 00:44:08,730
He part-times
at a folk village in the futur--

439
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:12,609
-He's working.
-What "village"?

440
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:15,570
"Part" what?

441
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:19,908
"Part" what?

442
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:24,746
By the way, it's a strange feeling.

443
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:27,957
Who would've thought
us three would be drinking together?

444
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:30,585
In the year 1938, at that.

445
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:34,047
Ages ago, I made a wish.

446
00:44:35,924 --> 00:44:38,551
That time would just stop.

447
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:44,516
That nothing would ever be taken
from the three of us.

448
00:44:50,063 --> 00:44:52,023
But my wishes never come true.

449
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:55,360
Damn it.

450
00:44:57,404 --> 00:44:59,364
Darn, I'm out of spirits.

451
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:03,701
I'll make that wish come true.
I'll be right back.

452
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:13,336
Boo!

453
00:45:17,257 --> 00:45:19,968
How did you live in the future world?

454
00:45:21,261 --> 00:45:22,762
I watched Yeon.

455
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:26,182
In that era, he has so much.

456
00:45:28,977 --> 00:45:33,648
Working for Taluipa,
with his family and friends at his side.

457
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,526
And even the woman he loves.

458
00:45:40,572 --> 00:45:41,739
Goodness.

459
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:56,171
-Tell me about you, not Yeon.
-Me?

460
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:10,810
…has excellent thermal conductivity
and look how sturdy it is.

461
00:46:10,894 --> 00:46:13,521
-All three types--
-…just like a brand new knife.

462
00:46:14,189 --> 00:46:15,231
Brother!

463
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:22,780
-You're literally designing a fight scene.
-That's right.

464
00:46:22,864 --> 00:46:24,782
As in this is a good place to fight--

465
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:27,619
Now, that blunt blade is--

466
00:46:28,203 --> 00:46:29,204
I am…

467
00:46:31,331 --> 00:46:32,790
living…

468
00:46:33,917 --> 00:46:37,337
I'm living so, so, so good!

469
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:45,178
That's good to hear.

470
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:03,530
Apricot? Orchid? Where did you all go?

471
00:47:11,621 --> 00:47:12,622
Where is everyone?

472
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:15,750
Apricot!

473
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:37,605
Excuse me.

474
00:47:48,658 --> 00:47:50,159
They're dead.

475
00:47:55,498 --> 00:47:57,834
Hello? Hello? Anyone there?

476
00:48:01,254 --> 00:48:02,297
Hello?

477
00:48:03,715 --> 00:48:05,800
I'm in here! Hello?

478
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:07,594
Is anyone out there? Hello?

479
00:48:07,677 --> 00:48:10,305
-Do you know what you've done?
-We're sorry.

480
00:48:11,014 --> 00:48:13,099
We only did it for fun.

481
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:14,851
What? Fun?

482
00:48:16,019 --> 00:48:18,980
That game calls
for the worst kinds of demons!

483
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:20,690
We really didn't know.

484
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:23,651
What happened to Ms. Sunwoo?

485
00:48:25,278 --> 00:48:28,156
I'll take care of it.
Go discipline yourselves in your room.

486
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:32,493
Oh, dear. Go along.

487
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:40,543
I can never understand why humans
continue to create such vile games.

488
00:48:41,294 --> 00:48:44,797
Corner games or ouija boards.
They can't even handle it.

489
00:48:44,881 --> 00:48:46,549
Curiosity for what lies beyond.

490
00:48:46,633 --> 00:48:48,635
Gosh, I'm so pissed.

491
00:48:48,718 --> 00:48:51,471
How dare some damn ghost
show its face in my area!

492
00:48:52,472 --> 00:48:55,516
Wouldn't it be a residual ghost living
in corners or thresholds?

493
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,436
It must be a twisted one,
but I doubt it's a powerful one.

494
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:01,648
I've never seen one take a human.

495
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:04,692
Let's catch it and ask
"Why did you take her?"

496
00:49:04,776 --> 00:49:07,236
-Geez, it's so bothersome.
-Gosh.

497
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:12,617
Slow down. Stop being so impetuous.

498
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:15,912
It's here.

499
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:19,457
But…

500
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:22,210
Why did it take a human?

501
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:25,129
Hello? Anyone out there?

502
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:45,066
-You want to play the corner game?
-You want to save Sunwoo Eun-ho, no?

503
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:49,070
-We need one for each corner.
-Gosh, I'm really afraid of ghosts.

504
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,825
Don't be so rude
in front of us three mountain gods.

505
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:56,327
You think we became gods
playing golf at Baekdudaegan?

506
00:49:56,411 --> 00:49:59,747
Stay out of this, Hong-joo.
We don't know what we're up against.

507
00:49:59,831 --> 00:50:02,792
Thanks for your concern,
but this is my home.

508
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:04,210
And I can protect myself.

509
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,257
You're not worried about me at all?

510
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:12,343
Just start.

511
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:15,179
Show yourself and I'll slice you, ghost.

512
00:50:17,807 --> 00:50:21,394
Everyone get in position.
Don't talk until it comes out.

513
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:24,188
-Yeah, yeah.
-Especially the one behind me.

514
00:50:27,567 --> 00:50:29,986
Kids, let's hurry and get this over with,

515
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:32,447
-so we can get more drinks.
-Sure, sure.

516
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:35,158
Let's start by saying our names.

517
00:50:36,826 --> 00:50:37,827
Koo Shin-ju.

518
00:50:38,828 --> 00:50:40,371
-Cheon Moo-yeong.
-Lee Yeon.

519
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:42,123
Ryu Hong-joo.

520
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:59,432
Where do you think Eun-ho disappeared to?

521
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:02,518
It's not our first time playing it.
So, why did this happen?

522
00:51:02,602 --> 00:51:06,981
Gosh, I have goosebumps!
Let's sprinkle salt first.

523
00:51:11,027 --> 00:51:13,613
Apricot.

524
00:51:17,325 --> 00:51:18,826
I'll go get it.

525
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:27,251
Guys, open the door.

526
00:51:28,878 --> 00:51:31,881
-Just come in.
-My hands are full.

527
00:51:31,964 --> 00:51:35,051
Gosh, did she bring a whole sack of salt?

528
00:51:39,972 --> 00:51:42,725
-What?
-I don't think that's her.

529
00:51:43,226 --> 00:51:45,353
-What do you mean?
-Come on, guys.

530
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:47,313
Open up. Hurry.

531
00:51:48,773 --> 00:51:51,275
-That's not Apricot.
-Huh?

532
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:54,153
What? No way.

533
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:20,221
Blood, blood!

534
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:25,685
Wait a minute.
Did we say our names backwards earlier?

535
00:52:26,269 --> 00:52:28,855
-I forgot to do that!
-What do we do?

536
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,483
The corner game isn't over yet!

537
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:57,717
It's here!

538
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:04,015
What're you doing with the lights off?

539
00:53:06,309 --> 00:53:09,228
-Rang, is that you?
-What are you doing still up?

540
00:53:09,979 --> 00:53:12,440
-Hey, turn the light on.
-That's not your brother!

541
00:53:13,024 --> 00:53:14,525
-Is it the ghost?
-Yeah, I'm certain.

542
00:53:14,609 --> 00:53:16,444
Strike him, Lee Yeon. Hurry!

543
00:53:20,615 --> 00:53:22,325
No!

544
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:24,619
Geez.

545
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:27,705
-Rang!
-You crazy bastard!

546
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:31,500
Sorry.

547
00:53:31,584 --> 00:53:33,669
Sorry, I thought you were the ghost.

548
00:53:35,296 --> 00:53:37,340
-Hey, Moo-yeong! You said--
-Said what?

549
00:53:37,423 --> 00:53:38,799
You said it was the ghost.

550
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:43,095
I haven't said a word since we started.

551
00:53:44,597 --> 00:53:45,598
What?

552
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:54,607
-You sure it wasn't you?
-Why do you think it was me?

553
00:53:57,777 --> 00:53:59,236
I'm sorry to interrupt.

554
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:01,656
But where did Madame Ryu go?

555
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:18,464
Apricot! Did you see anything outside?
A little while ago…

556
00:54:21,217 --> 00:54:22,301
I didn't see anything.

557
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,389
Open it.

558
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:34,897
Gosh, I'm so scared.

559
00:54:47,118 --> 00:54:50,204
No. This isn't what I wanted.

560
00:54:50,705 --> 00:54:51,789
Hong-joo…

561
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:54,291
Hey, Cheon Moo-yeong! Moo-yeong!

562
00:54:57,837 --> 00:55:00,089
Look at this. The salt has turned black.

563
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:07,680
We were mistaken. It's no ordinary ghost.

564
00:55:09,432 --> 00:55:13,185
If it can take Hong-joo, it's a demon.
One that's lived much longer than us.

565
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:17,231
All of you. Don't step out of here
until the rooster crows.

566
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:23,237
-Oh, no.
-I'm scared.

567
00:55:23,863 --> 00:55:25,364
My goodness.

568
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:28,868
-You're back.
-I found a witness.

569
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:31,037
-A cat?
-Yeah, it's Shin-ju's specialty.

570
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:34,373
What's it saying?

571
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:36,917
It came in hidden among the new gisaengs.

572
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:38,044
Wearing old sandals.

573
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:41,547
-What is it?
-What is it?

574
00:55:43,466 --> 00:55:44,717
What?

575
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:47,178
Why?

576
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:50,139
-What? Tell me.
-Jang San-beom.

577
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:55,978
Jang San-beom.
No wonder it kept mimicking voices.

578
00:55:56,937 --> 00:55:59,231
-He's quite a big shot, no?
-She hasn't got much time.

579
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:03,319
-And we know nothing about him.
-Let's find a way to catch him first.

580
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:05,112
Let's do that.

581
00:56:07,198 --> 00:56:08,199
Jang San-beom?

582
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:14,705
Hey, Rang.

583
00:56:15,206 --> 00:56:17,583
-Let me borrow your guys, huh?
-Not a chance.

584
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:19,502
I'll buy you 10 bowls of naengmyeon.

585
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:22,296
I already had some.

586
00:56:23,422 --> 00:56:24,423
Hey, just--

587
00:56:25,466 --> 00:56:28,010
What is it you want? Just tell me.

588
00:56:30,596 --> 00:56:32,932
-Get me your friend's blood.
-Are you a damn mosquito?

589
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:35,309
-Forget it, then.
-No, no, no. Fine.

590
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:37,728
I'll try talking to him.

591
00:56:44,693 --> 00:56:45,820
Boss!

592
00:56:57,248 --> 00:57:00,000
Hey, I told you not to do that
when you make an entrance.

593
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:04,213
I'll fix it, sir!

594
00:57:05,297 --> 00:57:08,342
But what did you summon me for, boss?

595
00:57:11,804 --> 00:57:12,805
You…

596
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:18,477
-You'd like to break the deal?
-Jang San-beom has…

597
00:57:19,854 --> 00:57:22,606
-taken the mountain god of the west.
-What?

598
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:25,943
So what? Didn't you ask for it?

599
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:28,946
I can't have it take her.

600
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:32,283
-Hong-joo.
-I pity your situation,

601
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:37,830
but a deal with a god is non-refundable.

602
00:57:39,874 --> 00:57:42,626
Just-- Just tell me the way!

603
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:45,963
-Where should I go? Please--
-The Path of the Damned.

604
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:48,841
It's somewhere
even Taluipa can't peek into!

605
00:57:51,302 --> 00:57:52,428
Don't go!

606
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:57,016
Don't do anything.

607
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:00,311
How come? Huh?

608
00:58:04,148 --> 00:58:07,401
I see endless darkness in your eyes.

609
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:12,364
Guys like you are perfect prey
for a world like that.

610
00:58:15,034 --> 00:58:16,702
I will return alive at all costs.

611
00:58:18,037 --> 00:58:19,330
With Hong-joo safe by me.

612
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:26,295
What a fool.

613
00:58:38,224 --> 00:58:42,102
She's the sole person who returned alive
from Jang San-beom's grasp.

614
00:58:42,186 --> 00:58:44,355
Granny, you were caught by Jang San-beom?

615
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:51,237
My sisters, just the four of us.

616
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,863
It was the winter solstice.

617
00:58:52,947 --> 00:58:55,741
The night grew long,
so we played the corner game and--

618
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:57,576
Yes. Cut to the chase.

619
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:58,786
Well, I talked out loud.

620
00:58:59,912 --> 00:59:01,247
By mistake.

621
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:02,665
So where did he take you?

622
00:59:03,499 --> 00:59:06,877
-I couldn't see because it was so dark.
-Are you kidding me.

623
00:59:09,672 --> 00:59:14,468
Aside from me,
many maidens were taken by him.

624
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,554
-Maidens?
-Yeah.

625
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:21,267
I hear they're all his wives.

626
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:25,938
So that's why he only takes women, huh?

627
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:28,899
If he searches for maidens,
why did he take you?

628
00:59:28,983 --> 00:59:34,488
In the olden days,
I was the beauty of this village.

629
00:59:37,533 --> 00:59:39,910
When I went out to work in the fields,

630
00:59:39,994 --> 00:59:43,956
the bachelors all over town would drool.

631
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:45,708
Hey, stop, stop.

632
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:48,961
-What's wrong with her?
-I hear her mind comes and goes.

633
00:59:49,044 --> 00:59:51,839
So how did you return alive?

634
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:55,467
-I followed Ttotto.
-Ttotto? What's a "Ttotto"?

635
00:59:55,551 --> 00:59:58,345
So what I'm saying is-- Well, that's--

636
01:00:03,309 --> 01:00:05,602
-I don't remember.
-Gosh. Damn it.

637
01:00:06,312 --> 01:00:09,356
-Did you get to see Jang San-beom?
-I-- I did.

638
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,608
-I saw him.
-What did he look like?

639
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:16,697
-I need paper and a brush.
-Paper and brush, go.

640
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:32,212
What? Is that all?

641
01:00:35,341 --> 01:00:37,259
Is this a butt?

642
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:41,930
This. What's this?

643
01:00:42,014 --> 01:00:44,850
-Our Ttotto.
-This is Ttotto?

644
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:49,396
A stray cat gave birth to Ttotto
in front of my house.

645
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:51,648
It would follow me everywhere.

646
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:53,108
A cat?

647
01:00:57,988 --> 01:01:01,492
-Hey.
-Gosh, its claws hurt.

648
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:04,912
It was holding onto
the warm fireplace for dear life--

649
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:08,499
-Why the cat?
-Cats are creatures that can see ghosts.

650
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:10,542
This one will pave the way to that world.

651
01:01:11,543 --> 01:01:12,795
This is a weapon.

652
01:01:13,504 --> 01:01:15,506
Made of wood grown
on human blood and flesh.

653
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:19,468
Wow, there's nothing better
to catch old demons like Jang San-beom.

654
01:01:20,552 --> 01:01:22,679
The duduri tree? How did you find this?

655
01:01:22,763 --> 01:01:24,390
DUDURI- TREE GROWN
ON HUMAN BLOOD AND FLESH

656
01:01:24,473 --> 01:01:25,557
Paid a hefty sum.

657
01:01:25,641 --> 01:01:28,018
Great, we're all ready then.

658
01:01:28,102 --> 01:01:30,479
Now, all we have to do is wait
for the sun to set.

659
01:01:32,064 --> 01:01:33,357
I'm counting on you.

660
01:01:35,484 --> 01:01:38,654
If you go in, you might not get out.
Just send your friend.

661
01:01:38,737 --> 01:01:41,115
-I have to go.
-I mean, why?

662
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:46,537
Hong-joo would've done the same for me.

663
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:48,497
Then take me, not Cheon Moo-yeong.

664
01:01:49,248 --> 01:01:52,626
I can go with anyone, but you!
How could I send you to your death!

665
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:53,961
Do you trust him?

666
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:56,463
An old friend or whatnot.
That was centuries ago.

667
01:01:59,842 --> 01:02:03,262
Ironically though,
as soon as I met Moo-yeong,

668
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:05,305
Jang San-beom showed up.

669
01:02:06,598 --> 01:02:09,852
Even when playing the corner game,
he wanted to leave Hong-joo out.

670
01:02:11,186 --> 01:02:12,187
You mean…

671
01:02:13,272 --> 01:02:14,606
He brought Jang San-beom?

672
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:19,236
I'm not sure. I still want to trust him.

673
01:02:20,612 --> 01:02:21,613
How pathetic.

674
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:23,824
What if this is a trap?

675
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:28,370
At least, we'll know
why Moo-yeong came to see me.

676
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:36,670
-Go tell Taluipa about this.
-That you're off to catch Jang San-beom?

677
01:02:37,713 --> 01:02:41,341
It's a place her eyes can't reach.
She's old, so she might worry.

678
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:44,887
Please be careful.
And please save Eun-ho too.

679
01:02:45,471 --> 01:02:48,432
Okay. Take good care of Rang
and the others.

680
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,366
-We'll start at eight o'clock sharp.
-Okay.

681
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:16,835
Hey, tie it.

682
01:03:18,712 --> 01:03:20,088
Is this my way back?

683
01:03:21,089 --> 01:03:22,382
Just in case.

684
01:03:23,675 --> 01:03:27,054
-Thanks for worrying about me.
-Don't ever die.

685
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:30,224
You know if you die there,
you can't even save your soul, right?

686
01:03:35,354 --> 01:03:36,730
Let's go.

687
01:03:48,534 --> 01:03:50,369
I'll buy you naengmyeon when I'm back.

688
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:54,224
Hey.

689
01:04:55,726 --> 01:04:56,935
Hey!

690
01:05:53,617 --> 01:05:54,618
Gwanghwamun?

691
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:07,881
-What? We're in the Joseon Dynasty period?
-Whenever this is, we find Hong-joo first.

692
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:11,176
Geez, seriously.

693
01:06:14,262 --> 01:06:16,682
Gosh, where the hell do we find her?

694
01:06:23,522 --> 01:06:28,568
-Hey, hold on. Isn't it a little strange?
-What is?

695
01:06:28,652 --> 01:06:31,363
There's not a single person,
let alone any sound.

696
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:34,658
Hong-joo!

697
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:37,077
Ryu Hong-joo!

698
01:06:40,038 --> 01:06:42,207
This won't do. Let's split up and look.

699
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:07,190
Hey, Moo-yeong! Cheon Moo-yeong!

700
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:20,996
-Are they all human?
-Yeah.

701
01:07:21,705 --> 01:07:23,540
How long do you think they've been dead?

702
01:07:28,462 --> 01:07:30,839
-At least, three days.
-Geez.

703
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:36,845
Who's that?

704
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:46,980
Who are you? Answer me.

705
01:07:51,026 --> 01:07:52,068
Who did this?

706
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:55,906
Jang San-beom.

707
01:07:58,492 --> 01:07:59,701
Do you know where he is?

708
01:08:05,665 --> 01:08:06,833
Where is he?

709
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:09,252
Tell me. We'll catch him.

710
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:16,051
Want to get out of here?

711
01:08:17,886 --> 01:08:20,347
Can you take us to Jang San-beom?

712
01:08:58,426 --> 01:09:00,554
-What the?
-Where did she go?

713
01:09:05,225 --> 01:09:08,979
Moo-yeong, no! Don't breathe!

714
01:09:21,867 --> 01:09:23,243
What's this? Hey!

715
01:09:24,035 --> 01:09:26,538
-Hey, Moo-yeong!
-I can't untie the ropes!

716
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:27,622
Oh, gosh.

717
01:09:40,468 --> 01:09:42,888
No, no, no! Go away, go!

718
01:09:43,722 --> 01:09:47,267
Ladies, no. Let's talk it out, huh?

719
01:09:47,976 --> 01:09:49,185
Let's talk! Come on!

720
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:03,658
What?

721
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:08,705
Hey, Moo-yeong!

722
01:10:09,581 --> 01:10:12,042
We're not dead. What is this?

723
01:10:15,587 --> 01:10:17,297
This is fake blood.

724
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:19,007
Goodness.

725
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,678
And cut! Okay!

726
01:10:24,596 --> 01:10:27,515
-Let's get up. We'll resume in ten!
-Huh?

727
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:37,317
Let's change for the next scene. Hurry!

728
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:41,655
IN SUPPORT OF TV SHOW
"JANG SAN-BEOM'S BRIDE"

729
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:48,036
What the hell is this?

730
01:10:57,420 --> 01:11:02,133
TALE OF THE NINE TAILED

731
01:11:26,032 --> 01:11:27,033
How is this possible?

732
01:11:28,493 --> 01:11:31,371
Once upon a time,
there lived a tiger at Jangsan,

733
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:33,957
that had a knack for imitating others.

734
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,126
This is the world you've created.

735
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:38,086
So this stage was made
from stealing my memories?

736
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:40,797
-Why are they spinning?
-I'm Kim Du-han.

737
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:42,799
Gosh, I'm losing my mind!

738
01:11:42,882 --> 01:11:45,093
One hour left.
We must find Hong-joo in time.

739
01:11:46,011 --> 01:11:48,263
Try to save this woman, if you can.

740
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:50,557
I'm going to kill him.

741
01:11:51,266 --> 01:11:53,685
-I…
-Cut the string!

742
01:11:53,768 --> 01:11:55,478
Why can't I let go of this?

743
01:11:56,604 --> 01:11:59,983
He intended for us to fight each other.

744
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:04,320
