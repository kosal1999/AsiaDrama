1
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:56,974
TALE OF THE NINE TAILED

2
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:02,772
Should I stomp him?

3
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:04,732
Let's stomp.

4
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:09,403
EPISODE 5

5
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,011
Why, you--

6
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,430
Do you even wash your hands after you pee?

7
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:38,599
You know how germy our hands are, huh?

8
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:41,727
E. coli, norovirus, and so much more!

9
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,278
Not the stroller!

10
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,948
-Don't kill him.
-Why not?

11
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:56,951
A Green Mothers' Society should
set an example for a child.

12
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,828
Geez, you're spoiling her.

13
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:02,706
Attention, everyone.

14
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:07,336
Allow me to get rid
of your traumatic experience today.

15
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,338
Goodness.

16
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:20,266
Today, we did not beat you up
nor did you come to Myoyeongak.

17
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:46,041
Look what we have here.

18
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:48,961
We have another Yeon, huh?

19
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:54,508
Ah-eum.

20
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:01,181
You're the one
who still grieves for that woman.

21
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,477
While I stand here facing you.

22
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:08,772
Just die.

23
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,941
Wait.

24
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:22,912
Please don't go.

25
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,542
I missed you.

26
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:33,172
I missed you so much,
I thought I'd lose my mind.

27
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:42,514
Don't ever leave me again…

28
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:46,727
Ah-eum.

29
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,067
Damn it.

30
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,236
What was I expecting?

31
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:06,622
Moo-yeong has returned.

32
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,167
Do you remember?

33
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:14,797
When the three of us used to race,
you always came in first.

34
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,258
I always watched you as I ran.

35
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:20,719
Only you.

36
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:24,306
Just like then…

37
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:35,234
I only seem to be watching you walk away.

38
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:40,364
Hong-joo?

39
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,464
Good night, Yeon of the year 1938.

40
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:05,180
You're him, aren't you?

41
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,894
-Wait. What do you mean?
-You can't fool me.

42
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,022
You stole all the jewelry from my house!

43
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,734
You have proof?
You don't have CCTV here, no?

44
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,444
CC… Oh.

45
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,863
So that's how you want to play?

46
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,993
You'll be on the front page tomorrow.

47
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,704
"The thief who robbed
seven homes of gold mining royalty."

48
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,582
-No, the other houses weren't me!
-Did you just confess?

49
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,666
Damn it.

50
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,419
Give me the camera.
You don't have my image rights!

51
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,422
-Give me this shirt!
-Give me the camera!

52
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,798
Give me the--

53
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:42,468
-Gosh, what are you doing?
-Give it. Give it to me!

54
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:43,677
Damn it!

55
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:51,602
What are you?

56
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:53,896
How are you fine after getting shot?

57
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,483
Well, it's something like…

58
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:02,446
It's like my specialty.
I don't seem to die from gun shots.

59
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,032
This gun wound…

60
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:08,202
I don't believe you,
but if you're speaking the truth…

61
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,289
What's your opinion
on Japanese imperialism?

62
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:15,375
What?

63
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:18,504
Why would the Governor-General want Mi-ho?

64
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:22,174
If the reward is enough to buy a house,
this is serious, right?

65
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,051
Want to see something?

66
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,721
Now, guess where it is.

67
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,356
-What the-- Huh?
-Okay. One more time.

68
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,286
What's this? She gets it right every time.

69
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,249
They say a foundling brings fortune,
but she's a natural gambler.

70
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,586
You'll bring me
a mountain of wealth, right?

71
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,214
Wait a minute…

72
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,258
Wealth and fortune…

73
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:06,760
Could she be a "fortune god"?

74
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,178
FORTUNE GOD -
INDIGENOUS GOD BRINGING FORTUNE

75
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,806
They say a fortune god chooses
where they will nest.

76
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,268
Whenever we left her elsewhere,
she kept coming back.

77
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:21,316
Don't they usually nest underground?
As a snake or a toad with no face.

78
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:26,071
Who are you? Huh? Tell me.

79
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,913
It's only a matter of time
before the Governor-General finds us.

80
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:37,249
Red-white mask is coming, too.

81
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,420
Is staying here the best choice
for her well-being?

82
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,506
Jung Dae-seung from Jongno Station?

83
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:48,051
That snake tried
to use us as human shields.

84
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:51,180
With Madame Ryu absent,
where did you go in all this mess?

85
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:56,560
What's this? Did Apricot report on us?

86
00:07:57,186 --> 00:08:00,397
No. I didn't tell anyone about the baby.

87
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,025
You fool. Do you think she's you?

88
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,485
Don't insult me, you idiot!

89
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:06,987
-Did you just pinch me?
-Ouch!

90
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:09,990
Why do you all look like hell?

91
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:14,119
We ran into an enormous tiger,
while on the baby search.

92
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:17,539
It said, "Give me some tteok,"
so I gave it some but it didn't want it.

93
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:18,957
It preferred honeyed flavors…

94
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,463
-Have you gone mad?
-I'm telling the truth, sir.

95
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:26,381
Right, guys?

96
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:29,218
-Yes, he's right.
-That's what happened.

97
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:30,302
It was a tiger, sir.

98
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:35,182
You must have been possessed by something.

99
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,227
Something that's not a human.

100
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:43,148
Who are you?

101
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:52,491
I found the baby's location.
She's at Myoyeongak.

102
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,619
-I'll go get her right away.
-Not on your own.

103
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:59,623
There's a pretty strong
Joseon demon there.

104
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,208
I'll go there myself.

105
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,002
You shouldn't be seen
entering a gisaeng house.

106
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:05,712
Your identity could be compromised…

107
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:10,509
The owner of Myoyeongak,
she's the woman you met on the train?

108
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,886
-Yes, sir.
-Use her.

109
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:18,100
I know that bitch's weakness.

110
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,644
My sister is a gisaeng there.

111
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,104
Confirm his statement.

112
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:28,527
Oh, I also heard that someone gave out
a ton of gold in the slums.

113
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,406
Where?

114
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:35,367
Where will you go, ma'am?

115
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,829
-To Lord Lee Yeon or Lord Moo-yeong?
-I'm not sure.

116
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,584
They were the only friends
I had my entire life…

117
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:49,172
-My dear friends are about to start a war.
-Please don't interfere.

118
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:52,759
One way or the other,
you'll end up getting hurt, ma'am.

119
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:55,178
No. I must be the one to do it.

120
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,555
Perhaps…

121
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,685
I may have to kill one of them
with my own hands.

122
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:08,567
Have a drink.

123
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:19,369
Isn't it hard working for me?

124
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,414
It's already been 17 years,
since I first met you, ma'am.

125
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,465
If it weren't for you, I would've died
at the hands of those Japanese soldiers.

126
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:35,719
Many native dogs continue to be killed,
due to the Stray Dog Slaughter Act.

127
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,054
STRAY DOG SLAUGHTER ACT

128
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,140
ACT THAT SLAUGHTERED 1.5 MILLION
DOGS FOR FUR AND LEATHER IN WAR

129
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,808
When I was a mountain god,

130
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,146
humans used to come bearing grain
to invoke my favor.

131
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:49,024
At first, I granted every wish
just to look good.

132
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:54,446
But getting everything for nothing was
what made humans so weak and evil.

133
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:57,032
You always said so,

134
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:00,410
"We are not the protagonists
in the human world."

135
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,247
We must fight our own battles.

136
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:08,085
Humans, and us likewise.

137
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:11,088
My battlefield is here.

138
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:13,965
I will serve one master
until the day I die.

139
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,859
-Look everywhere!
-Yes, sir!

140
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,072
Search everywhere!

141
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:40,700
Hey, have you searched there yet?
What about here?

142
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,411
Hurry up!

143
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,542
-Searched here yet?
-Search thoroughly.

144
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:50,419
Please have mercy!

145
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:56,425
Have mercy.

146
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:13,150
The fragrant smell of blood.

147
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:20,449
Lord Lee Yeon!

148
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,164
Did you run around all shirtless?
It's disgusting--

149
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,876
-Look who I brought.
-You guys work together?

150
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,045
Why would you bring our victim here?

151
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:36,882
I got caught, but we made amends.

152
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:42,596
I thought you were a detective.
Do detectives steal too?

153
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:46,057
Well, it was an inevitable situation.
I hope you try to understand.

154
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,728
Where's your modesty?

155
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:53,023
-I saved your life.
-Whoa, whoa.

156
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:57,444
-Hand over the stolen jewels.
-Oh, wait here a moment.

157
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,697
-Hey, not the golden ruler.
-Yes, I know.

158
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,116
And the police are scouring
for Mi-ho right now.

159
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,076
We can trust her.
She fights for independence.

160
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:13,585
You thieves raise a baby too?
You steal her too?

161
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,634
-You a martial arts master?
-What are you on about?

162
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,344
Then don't push it with me.

163
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:25,013
-I'll make mincemeat out of you.
-What did you say, punk?

164
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:32,437
The ruler made of gold is gone.
I wonder where it went?

165
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,023
I'll make up for it.

166
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,869
Gosh, I love Gyeongseong the most.

167
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,379
Look at their demeanor.
They're from an organization.

168
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:01,800
You the Madame of Myoyeongak?
The Governor-General has summoned you.

169
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:04,302
I'll be back.

170
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,784
Have you thought about my proposal?

171
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,037
Let me just ask one thing:
Why the independence movement?

172
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:36,376
With this much wealth, you can shop
and golf for the rest of your life, no?

173
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:41,298
At first, I started to dig
into my sister's death.

174
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:43,883
Then, I wanted my patriotism

175
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,219
to repay for my father's treacheries.

176
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,263
Eventually, I made comrades,

177
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,974
and heard of a comrade's death
almost every day.

178
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:56,688
Even with all this wealth,
I'm still in debt.

179
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:58,565
Because I survived.

180
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:02,319
Why did you pick me?

181
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,074
I'm in the spotlight
due to family circumstances, and you…

182
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,288
REWARD: ONE-MILLION-WON

183
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,748
…have a secret to keep.

184
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:19,669
You in or out?

185
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,882
In this era of Joseon's disarray,

186
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:26,926
I was merely busy taking care
of an opium addict.

187
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,012
That always bothered me.

188
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,264
Who knew I'd arrive in the year 1938,

189
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:33,975
and meet an activist
who happens to look just like my wife.

190
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,936
It must be fate.

191
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,693
Gyeongseong Station tonight.

192
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:46,571
A man will come,
holding a white chrysanthemum.

193
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,409
Since I've already been robbed,
let's just fund our war chest.

194
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:14,057
What do I do…
I think I might get neurosis.

195
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:36,538
Can you play the piano?

196
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,334
Not really, I…

197
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,504
I can only play do-re-mi-re-do.

198
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,385
Handle it carefully, comrade.

199
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:57,851
Comrade?

200
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:04,899
Comrade…

201
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:23,209
Pleasure to meet you.
I am Chief Commissioner, Ryuhei Kato.

202
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:32,427
-The reason for this is--
-I heard it on my way.

203
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:36,014
I hear it's because of a wanted baby.
And she's at Myoyeongak.

204
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,392
It seems we'll get along well.

205
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,313
A bothersome jerk seems to have it.

206
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,106
But will Madame Ryu hand it over?

207
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,983
How much do you know about me?

208
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:54,032
The woman wielding Gyeongseong's funds
and information in her palm.

209
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,575
But strangely so…

210
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:59,287
Someone who never seems to age.

211
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,080
The very woman of such whispers.

212
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:05,335
Well, you see…
I have a pretty intense beauty regimen.

213
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,712
Well, I heard something different.

214
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,598
We met on the train, no?

215
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:20,809
Damn it.

216
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,230
What did you want with me?

217
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:28,733
As you can see, she's a demon.

218
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:32,237
-I already knew what you were.
-If so…

219
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:36,991
You must know
you can't threaten me like this.

220
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:38,201
That's why…

221
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:41,621
we've prepared a small gift.

222
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,420
-Who are you?
-You like the gayageum, no?

223
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,633
That's a familiar face.

224
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:57,011
The wound is presumed to be caused
by an instrument string.

225
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:58,972
A gayageum, perhaps?

226
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:03,351
I hear he got into a dispute
with a gayageum-playing gisaeng that day.

227
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:05,478
Her name was…

228
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:08,815
Orchid, I believe?

229
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:11,276
She confessed
before we even plucked her nails.

230
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,820
-That she killed him.
-What?

231
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:20,702
She killed a soldier,
so she'll be shot to death.

232
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,370
And Myoyeongak will be shut down.

233
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,792
Where is Orchid?

234
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,593
Bring the baby
and make the fortune god talk.

235
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,137
If I don't have the gold mine map
by noon tomorrow,

236
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:41,598
that girl will die.

237
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:44,202
-Start the car.
-Is this the only way?

238
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:47,538
Everything I've built
in the human world is here.

239
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:52,418
I will save Orchid and protect Myoyeongak.

240
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:04,764
The woman has the baby.

241
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:10,853
Head over to Myoyeongak
and check on their reaction.

242
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,525
As long as we have the hostage,
they won't move carelessly.

243
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:23,616
That woman is not to be underestimated.

244
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:31,708
-Mi-ho!
-Mi-ho!

245
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:34,377
Mi-ho!

246
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:39,340
-She's not here. Where did our Mi-ho go?
-Maybe Lord Lee Rang took her out?

247
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:41,634
No, he went to gather his men.

248
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:45,096
-I don't see Orchid, either.
-What?

249
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,682
She went to the bath house,
but she never returned.

250
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:50,935
What the hell is--

251
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:04,032
Say it again.

252
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:07,577
If you find the kidnapped Orchid,
she'll tell you the baby's location.

253
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,037
Where is Hong-joo right now?

254
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,622
-Tell me!
-Please find Orchid.

255
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:13,708
That's all I have to say.

256
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,335
Whoa! Lord Lee Yeon!

257
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:23,217
Move. I'm going to make him talk.

258
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:31,934
Move the gisaeng, Orchid.
If you don't hear from me by noon--

259
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:35,021
You're telling me to shoot her, right?

260
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,532
The gold mines…

261
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:50,411
How bitter!

262
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,252
I'm going to count to three.

263
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,546
Tell me where the gold mine is.

264
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:03,633
One. Two…

265
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,263
-Three--
-Move.

266
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:25,988
I don't know how you lost her,

267
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,534
but she was loved.

268
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,413
The three men staying
at my home may be clumsy,

269
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:36,958
but they took care of her sincerely.

270
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:50,513
A human's life depends on you.

271
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:02,817
Please help.

272
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,083
Thank you.

273
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:22,753
Here.

274
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:25,715
That's not a mine?

275
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,385
Gold can also be found in the river.

276
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:31,888
-Check if it's there.
-Yes, sir.

277
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:35,224
Come with us.

278
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:38,394
-Why should I?
-Whether humans or demons,

279
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:41,606
I can't trust you Joseon pricks.

280
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:53,159
-Where is Orchid right now?
-Hey! Do you want to see me get fired?

281
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:54,911
Who do you think I'm doing this for?

282
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:57,622
-You killed her!
-That's not it!

283
00:24:58,664 --> 00:24:59,665
Goodness.

284
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:05,213
Fine. Watch your only sister die
and live a good life.

285
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:08,299
-Give that to me!
-Where is Orchid?

286
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:12,845
-Gosh, we're in a pickle.
-Why Jongno Police Station of all places?

287
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:14,805
Should we just force ourselves in?

288
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:17,225
Roughly how many people are
inside a police station?

289
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:20,228
-I don't know. At least 250 people?
-250?

290
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:23,773
We have 45 minutes until noon.

291
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,317
-We've no time for this.
-What about Lord Lee Rang?

292
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,694
-He's going to help Hong-joo.
-Then what do we do?

293
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:31,322
How about this?

294
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:35,701
No, even if my life depended on it!

295
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:38,329
Shall I do it then?
Me, the former mountain god?

296
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:41,540
-I must save my dignity!
-On about that again, huh?

297
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,671
-You idiot!
-Stop right there!

298
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:57,390
-Just be confident.
-Right. We're taking over Jongno Station.

299
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:06,816
Hey, can you speak Japanese?

300
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,068
-I studied at an academy for six months.
-Oh?

301
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:13,322
-It means?
-"Can I get a refund?"

302
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:17,034
-Geez.
-Don't be scared. Half of 'em are Korean.

303
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:31,424
You two look unfamiliar.

304
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:33,342
Oh, we're new here, sir.

305
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:36,971
-Are you two Korean?
-Yes, sir!

306
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:38,931
-I am Korean too.
-Yes, sir…

307
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:44,437
But have we met before?

308
00:26:46,314 --> 00:26:47,440
Well…

309
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,944
I often hear that I have a common face.

310
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:55,197
-Your face is common?
-Yes.

311
00:26:58,326 --> 00:27:00,745
Anyway, keep up the good work.

312
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:03,748
Wait.

313
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,380
You're new, so I guess you wouldn't know.

314
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:22,558
I-- I have to shave my head?
Why? Hair's everything to a man.

315
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,018
The war is to be prolonged.

316
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:25,603
A SHAVING DECREE WAS MADE
TO POLICEMEN IN 1938

317
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:27,772
An expression of our devotion
even on the home front.

318
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,483
It means to establish your resolve.

319
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:33,444
Oh, my resolve…

320
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:38,240
Here. Allow me, sir!

321
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:41,160
I was an intern
at Choi Seung-ja Hair Salon.

322
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,329
Not this time, sir.

323
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:47,500
Take a seat.

324
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:03,849
Okay.

325
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,814
Oh, look. I snipped it off.

326
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:14,568
20 MINUTES UNTIL NOON

327
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:15,653
Let's go. Go.

328
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:22,410
Take a close look. Okay?

329
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:23,994
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir!

330
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:29,291
-If you see anything sparkle, tell me!
-Yes, sir.

331
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:33,254
-You see anything?
-No, no. There's nothing here.

332
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:35,756
For goodness' sake.

333
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:41,887
I can't believe I'm only here to babysit.

334
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:44,390
You sure you're related to Apricot?

335
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:49,437
Why? Is she ashamed
that her brother is a sellout?

336
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:54,108
I know policemen don't earn much,
but you send her money every month, no?

337
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:58,654
-It's so endearing, I can't stand it.
-Hey, that's enough!

338
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,157
If it wasn't for her,
I'd have raided your place a dozen times!

339
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,034
If you weren't her brother,
this would be your grave.

340
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:13,544
Look at you all smiling,
without a clue in the world. Goodness.

341
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:17,590
Don't smile, kid.

342
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:21,385
If they don't find any gold today,
you and your dad are dead, you punk.

343
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:23,220
My goodness.

344
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:29,101
Why this little brat!

345
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:32,980
Look here! She just flicked me off, no?

346
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:34,857
You have no filter, indeed.

347
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:40,112
There's no gold, sir!

348
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:52,458
Get up.

349
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:55,586
You dare fool me?

350
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,703
-What?
-Huh?

351
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:23,382
What are you all doing? Go check it out!

352
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:25,843
Hey, hurry up and just--

353
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:28,762
-Whoa!
-Oh-- Oh!

354
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:30,472
What's that?

355
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:33,559
Come here!

356
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:41,609
It's gold…

357
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:44,612
I found gold!

358
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:49,158
Hey, carrot!

359
00:31:50,284 --> 00:31:51,785
Is it really gold?

360
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:11,221
Hey, get up!

361
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:13,349
Wake up, wake up!

362
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:18,479
The governor's office offered a deal.

363
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,857
If I don't bring the baby,
Orchid will die.

364
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:26,862
So what's your choice?

365
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:29,948
I've already made my choice.

366
00:32:33,077 --> 00:32:35,037
Hey, go to sleep.

367
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:39,291
Then, how about this?

368
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:44,755
Why don't you do the disguise?

369
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:49,677
Please hang in there until we save Orchid.
You've been doing the disguises anyway.

370
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:53,347
Only the three of us know
about this operation, okay?

371
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,897
Hey, your hair looks fine.

372
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:06,402
-Where the hell are we?
-We're the police, so march down and ask.

373
00:33:06,944 --> 00:33:10,155
-Over there!
-I only need to ask, right? Hey.

374
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:15,703
Where's the geisha from Myoyeongak?
I have orders to move her.

375
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:17,621
-To where?
-The Governor-General.

376
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:20,040
I see. Check the interrogation room.

377
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:26,588
We go downstairs?
Hey, we have 10 minutes left!

378
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:28,757
Move it!

379
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:31,343
You, come here.

380
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:35,055
Lee Yeon? Aren't you Lee Yeon?

381
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:37,891
-Who were they again?
-The disguised raccoon couple.

382
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:40,811
Why are you here pretending
to be the police?

383
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:42,354
It's all your fault!

384
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:44,815
-We got detained handing this out!
-Silence!

385
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:46,108
-You--
-You know them?

386
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:49,445
Yes, they were mine to catch,
so they seem to have a grudge on me.

387
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:52,114
-Why you nine-tailed fox--
-Hey!

388
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,992
-A fox?
-He's hallucinating. He's an opium addict.

389
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:57,578
Look at his eyes. Look here!

390
00:33:57,661 --> 00:34:00,456
-You're the addi--
-That's enough. Take them away!

391
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:06,754
The new guys are quite passionate, huh?

392
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:21,894
Orchid, are you okay?

393
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:24,855
-Wake up.
-Gosh, those bastards.

394
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,607
How could they do this to her?

395
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,234
Lord Lee Yeon?

396
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:31,487
-Shin-ju's here too?
-Yeah.

397
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:35,073
-Can you get up? Let's go.
-No.

398
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:37,451
If I run away,
Madame Ryu will be in danger.

399
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:40,537
Do you know what she's done to save you?

400
00:34:42,498 --> 00:34:44,333
Get up. We don't have much time.

401
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:52,508
This way.

402
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:54,676
Walk straight!

403
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:01,391
-Where's this geisha named Orchid?
-Governor-General's orders to move her.

404
00:35:01,475 --> 00:35:04,645
Some other guys
already came for her, though.

405
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:06,939
Hmm…

406
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:10,192
-Hey. Hey!
-Hey!

407
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:14,446
Hey, stop right there!

408
00:35:17,825 --> 00:35:20,494
Stop them!

409
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:23,497
All that comes up is sand.

410
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,374
-Keep your eyes open!
-Yes, sir.

411
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,793
Tell me if you see anything sparkle!

412
00:35:28,669 --> 00:35:30,379
Hurry and dig!

413
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:33,090
Excuse me, sir.
I think we need more people.

414
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:36,635
-Then we--
-You'll finish by today, no matter what.

415
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:37,803
-Understood, sir.
-Yes!

416
00:35:38,554 --> 00:35:39,555
Hurry up!

417
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:42,891
Where did the baby go?
You're not even watching her. Gosh!

418
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:47,688
Where are you going, huh?

419
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:50,566
Goodness, there you are.
Where'd you think you're going?

420
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,818
Put me down, you damn cop.

421
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:57,823
Can you… talk?

422
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,867
It's a secret. Come closer.

423
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,497
-Screw you!
-Ouch!

424
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,374
Ow, that hurts!

425
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:10,836
Goodness.

426
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:13,672
Come here, you.

427
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:20,679
-Hey, control your temper.
-It's all your fault.

428
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:22,639
Will there be more gold?

429
00:36:22,723 --> 00:36:25,934
-This baby bites people!
-Yeah, kids are like that.

430
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:28,770
-No, I mean she called me a cop!
-Stop being ridiculous.

431
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:30,731
But she talks so well!

432
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:31,815
Hey.

433
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:35,611
Point out all the gold mines.

434
00:36:57,341 --> 00:36:59,509
Oh-- Oh, wait. Slow down.

435
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:06,975
-Are you sure?
-Yes, sir.

436
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:11,647
It includes a gold mine
being developed in secret.

437
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,190
This guy is the real deal.

438
00:37:14,608 --> 00:37:15,609
Is that so?

439
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:36,254
No, not yet.

440
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,340
We must save Orchid first.

441
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:45,347
Yeon, hurry up.

442
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:54,147
-Stop there!
-Get 'em!

443
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:59,528
-Hold on!
-Don't let them get away!

444
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:01,697
Catch 'em!

445
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,991
-Stop, stop!
-Catch them!

446
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,369
Get 'em!

447
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,874
-Go on ahead. I'll distract them.
-Okay.

448
00:38:16,003 --> 00:38:17,295
Hey, arrest me.

449
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:02,174
Where do you think
you're touching, you bastard!

450
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:04,468
What the hell are you?

451
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:07,471
Die!

452
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,307
Die, die!

453
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:13,310
Geez. Die, just die!

454
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:17,147
Gosh, you make my skin crawl!

455
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:20,150
Damn it.

456
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:23,361
This is why I hate disguises.

457
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:29,618
-Lord Lee Yeon!
-Those pricks touched my-- Forget it.

458
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:33,455
But how do we tell them Orchid is safe?
We don't even have cell phones.

459
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,126
Hold on.

460
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:57,479
What the hell?
What's with the weather, huh?

461
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,108
It's a sign from Yeon. Orchid is safe.

462
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:05,487
-Give this to the Chief Commissioner now.
-Yes, sir.

463
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,781
With this much gold,
a Hundred-Year-War sounds cheap!

464
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:17,374
-If we're done here, I'll be off.
-Not interested what happens to the kid?

465
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,335
I'm not really a humanist, you know.

466
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:25,549
That bitch dares to betray me?

467
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:29,678
Sorry, but I can't have the map
fall into their hands.

468
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:38,854
Your dad is dead.
So you'd become a begrudging demon, no?

469
00:40:45,986 --> 00:40:48,446
Geez. Thought I'd suffocate,
all squished in there.

470
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,490
-Who are you?
-Me?

471
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:53,368
I'm Joseon's nine-tailed fox.

472
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:26,359
Everyone, freeze!

473
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:32,908
One more step
and this will be your cemetery.

474
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:38,205
Hey, fox-in-law.
I'll have your back. Go for it.

475
00:41:46,755 --> 00:41:49,591
-Will Lord Lee Rang be okay?
-He has Hong-joo.

476
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:54,721
I'll take Orchid to Myoyeongak.
What about our Mi-ho?

477
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:57,265
I left her with Water Snail Bride.
I'll go get her.

478
00:42:13,073 --> 00:42:14,074
What's this?

479
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,409
He reeks of blood.

480
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:22,457
Was there a demon in Joseon
with this much power?

481
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:34,886
What're you looking at?

482
00:42:35,804 --> 00:42:39,349
-What's your name?
-Lee Yeon.

483
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:46,064
My name is Ryuhei Kato.
Remember it. We'll meet again.

484
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:53,571
You better stop eating humans.

485
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:56,783
Or else your head might fly off.

486
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,292
-Lord Lee Yeon!
-Don't come!

487
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:57,969
Lee Yeon.

488
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:23,870
You did well.

489
00:44:24,454 --> 00:44:28,124
Madame, I'll never forget
what you've done for me.

490
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,294
It was nothing.

491
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,881
You almost lost everything because of me.

492
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:37,550
You idiot.

493
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:41,096
Why did you say you killed him?
You should've said it was me.

494
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:44,224
I wanted to protect you, ma'am.

495
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:47,060
As you've always protected us.

496
00:45:16,798 --> 00:45:18,383
You're back, ma'am.

497
00:45:20,427 --> 00:45:21,886
Perhaps, our Mi-ho is--

498
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,722
-She is the fortune god.
-Huh?

499
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:27,934
-She's not your daughter?
-I just pull petty tricks,

500
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:30,603
but it's my duty to protect her.

501
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:32,939
Why the form of a baby though?

502
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:36,818
As the god who controls desire,
she is born in the purest form of a baby,

503
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:39,028
and never grows old.

504
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:41,030
That's too harsh on the child.

505
00:45:41,114 --> 00:45:43,116
It's her destiny as an indigenous god.

506
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:46,453
-Where will you go now?
-I don't know.

507
00:45:46,536 --> 00:45:50,957
She is the one who decides
where to stay or whom to bless.

508
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,794
-I packed baby supplies in the bag.
-Thank you.

509
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,967
-Geez. Off you go.
-Can I just…

510
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:03,136
Can I hold her one last time?

511
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:07,515
Mi-ho.

512
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:12,187
I thought my back would break
from washing your diapers.

513
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:14,147
It's already farewells, huh?

514
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:17,442
Wherever you go
and whatever name you live by,

515
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:21,696
please remember us.
But I don't think she will.

516
00:46:22,322 --> 00:46:23,865
Geez, stop being ridiculous.

517
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:25,867
Farewell, okay?

518
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:30,079
It's good to give good fortune to humans,
but you be fortunate too.

519
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:32,290
Lord Lee Rang, say something too.

520
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:36,252
I'm good.

521
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:41,883
Here, here.

522
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:48,306
Yes? Oh, I see.

523
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:52,227
What's she saying?

524
00:46:53,186 --> 00:46:57,106
She says she prefers the bandit
over the doctor.

525
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:00,026
Gosh, I knew it.

526
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:03,196
Well-- You're not too bad yourself.

527
00:47:06,115 --> 00:47:07,367
Yes?

528
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:11,538
She says you will meet someone
you've been grieving.

529
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:17,794
But because of your pure nature,
you will lose your way.

530
00:47:21,089 --> 00:47:22,090
What do you mean?

531
00:47:31,808 --> 00:47:33,768
Could you roll up your sleeves?

532
00:47:44,946 --> 00:47:47,991
She hopes this will help you
find your way.

533
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:59,877
I'll get going now.

534
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:16,477
Goodbye.

535
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:19,439
Back when we were all poor,

536
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:24,110
Joseon people used to take in foundlings
to raise as their own.

537
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:27,530
-A child who brings good fortune.
-Stop crying.

538
00:48:27,614 --> 00:48:31,326
That name saved the lives of many babies
from starving to death.

539
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:36,039
But we met the real foundling.

540
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:48,843
Excuse me…

541
00:48:51,054 --> 00:48:54,098
-Geez, seriously.
-May I ask something, sir?

542
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:57,602
I hear there's a pawnshop for demons.
Do you know of it?

543
00:48:57,685 --> 00:49:00,021
The pawnshop? Of course.

544
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:05,193
I bought this there.
A fan that lengthens the nose.

545
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:08,446
Don't blabber your mouth to a stranger.
This is a harsh world.

546
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:11,199
VICTIMS' CLUB
FOR DEMONS VICTIMIZED BY THE FOX

547
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:14,077
Do you know Lee Yeon?
I'm here to catch him too.

548
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:18,456
Oh, my, my! He's on our side!

549
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,042
-Are you good at fighting?
-Pardon?

550
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:23,961
What are you doing?
Tell him anything at all!

551
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:27,131
Perhaps, you know the location…

552
00:49:27,215 --> 00:49:31,302
The pawnshop for demons only opens
on the last day of the month.

553
00:49:31,386 --> 00:49:32,387
The last day?

554
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:36,015
I don't have much time…
Do you know who owns the place?

555
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:39,519
Well, there's a rumor
that he's a big shot.

556
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:41,604
-But we're not sure.
-Shall we dig around?

557
00:49:41,688 --> 00:49:44,232
We've got a social butterfly
at our meeting.

558
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,567
Please do. I'll compensate handsomely…

559
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:48,027
-No need!
-No need!

560
00:49:48,528 --> 00:49:49,904
Excuse me…

561
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:31,446
Not yet… I still have work left to do.

562
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:57,513
Father, what's wrong?

563
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:03,978
Mother, you're awake.

564
00:51:07,482 --> 00:51:09,233
The King of Five Paths, right?

565
00:51:09,317 --> 00:51:10,318
KING OF FIVE PATHS

566
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:14,322
THE TENTH KING OF HELL
WHO RULES OVER DARKNESS HELL

567
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:17,992
I hate people talking to me
when I'm watching movies.

568
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:20,453
I have something to tell you.

569
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:23,080
You can tell me after the movie.

570
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:25,249
It's an urgent matter.

571
00:51:27,752 --> 00:51:28,961
I'm not in a hurry.

572
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:37,136
I already watched this movie.
They all die in the end.

573
00:51:39,806 --> 00:51:40,932
Why you crazy--

574
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:42,892
-Hey, be quiet!
-Gosh.

575
00:51:45,937 --> 00:51:47,355
I'm sorry.

576
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:48,981
My apologies…

577
00:51:52,485 --> 00:51:54,612
You're one heinous being.

578
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,907
Want to roll around in Darkness Hell?

579
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:59,575
For what crime?

580
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:02,745
The crime…

581
00:52:04,163 --> 00:52:05,540
of spoiling a movie…

582
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:08,668
That's nonchargeable.

583
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:14,006
A child who shouldn't live
has returned alive.

584
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:16,008
From the future, at that.

585
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:18,636
Who do you think did it?

586
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:21,430
Impossible.

587
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,017
Are you questioning the Kings of Hell?

588
00:52:27,687 --> 00:52:31,816
-To be precise, I'm questioning you, sir.
-Wh--?

589
00:52:32,525 --> 00:52:36,404
Always playing hooky, dipping in and out
of the World of the Living.

590
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:38,489
Playing hooky? Playing hoo--?

591
00:52:38,573 --> 00:52:40,408
-What's with him?
-Be quiet!

592
00:52:46,831 --> 00:52:48,040
It's not me.

593
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:52,336
I must watch movies, run my business.
I'm a very busy man.

594
00:52:53,754 --> 00:52:55,715
If not the kings, then who?

595
00:52:56,632 --> 00:53:00,052
-The only being with that much power--
-Is you.

596
00:53:02,013 --> 00:53:05,808
There was one other guy too, no?

597
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:17,069
There's no way he could've done it.

598
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:24,994
Who's there?

599
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:29,874
You looking for the pawnshop for demons?

600
00:53:33,336 --> 00:53:34,629
I am…

601
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:37,757
the owner of that pawnshop.

602
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:42,011
You're the former mountain god
of the north, correct?

603
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:46,849
By the looks of it,
you're not from this era.

604
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:49,810
And you're no ordinary merchant.

605
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:52,229
May I ask for your name?

606
00:53:53,272 --> 00:53:57,151
I'm the--
Gosh. Do I have to say it myself?

607
00:53:59,487 --> 00:54:00,738
There.

608
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:02,907
Five…

609
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:04,116
What's "five"?

610
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:07,161
Gosh, you're frustrating.

611
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,040
The King of Five-- Paths!

612
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:14,001
One of the Ten Kings of Hell is here?

613
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:16,879
Forgive me. I didn't recognize you.

614
00:54:21,342 --> 00:54:25,262
I wonder how such a proper guy
has been challenging Taluipa?

615
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:29,558
I cannot enter your shop, sir.
Since you already know everything.

616
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:32,061
You're mistaken.

617
00:54:32,979 --> 00:54:34,230
Pardon?

618
00:54:35,982 --> 00:54:39,318
This is purely a hobby of mine.
Let's leave politics out of it.

619
00:54:39,402 --> 00:54:42,363
-You mean…
-It means I quite like you.

620
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:46,701
So, what is it you want?

621
00:54:49,161 --> 00:54:50,997
I want to reclaim my body.

622
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,418
Come closer.

623
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:05,261
Taluipa's work, huh?

624
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:11,767
-This may be quite a hassle.
-If you can fix it, I'll do anything.

625
00:55:11,851 --> 00:55:14,854
If so, let's take a look.

626
00:55:16,022 --> 00:55:18,274
Where was it?

627
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:19,734
Oh, here it is.

628
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:22,737
Cut the yeot, cha, cha, cha
Ja-ga-jang, jang, jang!

629
00:55:24,363 --> 00:55:28,075
You don't smile at all.
Geez, such an uptight fella.

630
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:35,666
Here.

631
00:55:39,045 --> 00:55:40,463
What will you give me in return?

632
00:55:44,008 --> 00:55:45,301
Anything, sir.

633
00:55:46,886 --> 00:55:47,887
Even my soul.

634
00:55:55,895 --> 00:55:58,981
You really don't know
who red-white mask is?

635
00:56:00,024 --> 00:56:02,693
How many times must I tell you?
I can't see him either!

636
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:06,781
-Then, why have those eyes at all?
-Gosh, you make my blood boil.

637
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:10,242
Hey.

638
00:56:10,743 --> 00:56:14,038
So, I'm stuck with you in the future, huh?

639
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:18,501
Give the future me a heartfelt consolation
when you get home.

640
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:21,712
But I'm saying that
I might not be able to go home.

641
00:56:21,796 --> 00:56:23,964
The fortune god said I'll lose my way!

642
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:26,008
Why? Because of the red-white mask!

643
00:56:26,092 --> 00:56:29,887
The Guardian Stone will pave the way,
and the gate will open in time!

644
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:32,389
Just take care of the stone, you brat.

645
00:56:33,808 --> 00:56:35,559
Why are you so indifferent to me?

646
00:56:36,185 --> 00:56:37,812
Are you some cyborg in 1938?

647
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:40,606
Cy-- What?

648
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:42,733
Gosh, never mind.

649
00:56:42,817 --> 00:56:46,362
If I don't get home,
watch me destroy worlds, Living and Dead!

650
00:56:46,862 --> 00:56:50,658
Gosh, seriously.
I can't believe I traveled here for this.

651
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:55,871
Why are you lying to Yeon?

652
00:56:57,998 --> 00:57:01,877
Because it's Moo-yeong…
behind that damn red-white mask.

653
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:08,259
A child born with the fate of a Gemini…

654
00:57:11,387 --> 00:57:15,141
They say it's either a blessing
or a disaster to the world.

655
00:57:15,224 --> 00:57:16,725
But I was confident.

656
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:21,730
That he would become
a benevolent mountain god.

657
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:26,026
Yet, you turned him into stone,

658
00:57:27,695 --> 00:57:32,074
and you were heartbroken
for a very long time.

659
00:57:32,575 --> 00:57:35,119
You wept bitter tears. I know that.

660
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:39,373
I tried so hard not to get attached.

661
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:43,794
You want to save Moo-yeong, right?

662
00:57:44,753 --> 00:57:46,213
I'm not sure.

663
00:57:47,131 --> 00:57:50,092
I'm just counting on this situation.

664
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,846
The fact that my future self sent Yeon

665
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:58,809
all the way here to catch Moo-yeong…

666
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:04,940
must be with good reason.

667
00:58:16,368 --> 00:58:17,536
I'll be back, brother.

668
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:25,753
OBOK BOUTIQUE

669
00:58:36,597 --> 00:58:38,015
Going on another date today?

670
00:58:39,767 --> 00:58:41,227
He says he'll come to the club.

671
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:47,233
-I plan to win his heart over today.
-Oh? How so?

672
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:54,114
Magazines say men like women
who are good listeners.

673
00:58:54,198 --> 00:58:55,532
Why? What did that punk say?

674
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:00,871
Something like, "If you want to sing,
stand firm on both legs."

675
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:04,375
"And not to become a spectacle."

676
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:07,253
That's a first.

677
00:59:08,754 --> 00:59:10,089
For Lee Rang, that brat…

678
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:17,012
Gosh, it's uncomfortable.
It's way too uncomfortable.

679
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:19,515
-My neck hurts so much.
-I'm going.

680
00:59:20,516 --> 00:59:21,642
Where are you going?

681
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:27,147
-Where are you going at this hour?
-I know where he's going.

682
00:59:28,232 --> 00:59:29,316
He's going on a date.

683
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:31,610
A date?

684
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:34,363
I want to go too.

685
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:41,287
Oh, my. What's the occasion?

686
00:59:42,997 --> 00:59:46,792
You said to come to the club with
a bouquet of flowers. As your second wish.

687
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:48,752
Right…

688
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:52,172
-Well, thank you anyway.
-Okay. Bye, then.

689
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:53,382
Hold on.

690
00:59:53,966 --> 00:59:57,261
You have to watch my show.
That's included in the wish.

691
00:59:57,344 --> 00:59:59,888
Really? Sure, why not.

692
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:17,823
-Wow, flowers?
-Lord Lee Rang must like her too.

693
01:00:17,906 --> 01:00:19,783
Hey, doesn't she looks so kind?

694
01:00:20,326 --> 01:00:23,662
She wants to be a singer,
but she's the queen of part-time jobs.

695
01:00:23,746 --> 01:00:26,874
That's great!
So they'll be a working married couple.

696
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:30,044
-How old is she?
-She's 40 years older than Lord Lee Rang.

697
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:33,505
That's nothing between demons.
They're a perfect match.

698
01:00:40,179 --> 01:00:41,597
You sure you can leave him?

699
01:00:45,684 --> 01:00:46,894
Honestly, no.

700
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:51,523
He's only going to think
I abandoned him again.

701
01:00:53,859 --> 01:00:55,778
He never knows how I feel, huh?

702
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:51,417
Drinks from the lady over there.

703
01:01:54,002 --> 01:01:55,254
So it's free, right?

704
01:01:59,591 --> 01:02:01,176
What do you do for a living?

705
01:02:03,011 --> 01:02:04,096
Why do you ask?

706
01:02:05,264 --> 01:02:07,808
You stole a girl's heart.

707
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:10,144
Perhaps you're a thief?

708
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:14,189
Are you a cop? You raiding my bandit gang?

709
01:02:17,025 --> 01:02:19,987
Oh, my. You're funny, too!

710
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:10,621
Did she do this?

711
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:14,500
Wow. If they quarrel,
Lord Lee Rang will be beaten hollow.

712
01:03:16,418 --> 01:03:17,711
-Whoa.
-Wow.

713
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:23,717
CLUB PARADISE

714
01:03:33,352 --> 01:03:35,062
Is this how it ends for us?

715
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:38,774
Why did you lie?

716
01:03:39,483 --> 01:03:41,652
Sorry, you must be disappointed in me.

717
01:03:42,528 --> 01:03:44,988
-I can't believe I did that…
-I liked it.

718
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,742
It's much stronger than I thought.
Your combat power!

719
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:49,910
Combat power?

720
01:03:50,661 --> 01:03:52,663
-It's cool.
-Really?

721
01:03:53,372 --> 01:03:55,082
You're the first one to tell me that!

722
01:04:00,879 --> 01:04:02,548
-Careful!
-He didn't hear it!

723
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:06,468
Can you run?

724
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:08,929
Some annoying guys have caught up with us.

725
01:04:10,681 --> 01:04:12,474
I can run.

726
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:25,631
Gosh, where did they run off to?

727
01:05:26,131 --> 01:05:30,218
-They're completely out of sight.
-I can't find them at all!

728
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:35,098
Are they gone--

729
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:56,536
They're gone.

730
01:06:07,422 --> 01:06:08,799
Shall we go eat together?

731
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:12,552
I'm not sure.

732
01:06:13,512 --> 01:06:15,514
Only if we're having naengmyeon.

733
01:06:18,433 --> 01:06:21,770
-We got caught because of you.
-I can't believe I sneezed right then.

734
01:06:21,853 --> 01:06:26,316
-But they're all set to go, right?
-Yes. We're done here. Done.

735
01:06:28,443 --> 01:06:30,153
I need to see someone real quick.

736
01:06:30,946 --> 01:06:33,448
-Who?
-I have a private life too.

737
01:06:33,532 --> 01:06:36,076
-Don't wait up. Bye!
-Hey, where are you going?

738
01:06:37,577 --> 01:06:39,329
Gosh, these punks--

739
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:45,544
Geez. I miss Ji-ah too.

740
01:07:07,607 --> 01:07:09,067
He will definitely come…

741
01:07:10,068 --> 01:07:11,862
for this treasure.

742
01:07:13,613 --> 01:07:17,659
Yeon. Lee Yeon. Come play with me.

743
01:07:27,836 --> 01:07:28,837
What's this?

744
01:07:47,439 --> 01:07:48,440
Cheon Moo-yeong?

745
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:53,487
-Is it really you?
-Yes, it's me.

746
01:07:56,364 --> 01:07:58,492
-How are you--
-Alive?

747
01:08:19,304 --> 01:08:20,555
Are you red-white mask?

748
01:08:22,641 --> 01:08:27,354
TALE OF THE NINE TAILED

749
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:52,796
It's no ordinary demon.

750
01:08:55,674 --> 01:08:59,219
I'm going to protect you,
even if we end up in shreds.

751
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:01,888
Let's play,
just like our carefree old days.

752
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:04,474
There's someone else in this room!

753
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:07,936
-Where did Madame Ryu go?
-I must find Hong-joo.

754
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:09,855
What if this is a trap?

755
01:09:09,938 --> 01:09:13,149
At least, we'll know
why Moo-yeong came to see me.

756
01:09:13,233 --> 01:09:15,151
The Path of the Damned.

757
01:09:15,235 --> 01:09:18,238
It's somewhere
even Taluipa can't peek into!

758
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:20,031
Yeon, please be my pawn.

759
01:09:20,115 --> 01:09:21,783
I can't die here…

760
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:25,495
