1
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:56,974
TALE OF THE NINE TAILED

2
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,393
EPISODE 9

3
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:03,397
-Tastes just right.
-By the way, where is it?

4
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:07,777
The guardian stone and the golden ruler.

5
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,492
I'm only asking because I'm worried.

6
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:16,285
They'll be rushing in any day now.

7
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:22,500
Red-white mask and the Governor-General.
I'd hate to get caught up in all that.

8
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:28,380
Fine. I'll leave Myoyeongak
with the stone and the ruler, then.

9
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:34,261
So… where did you put it?

10
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,197
You…

11
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:56,325
hid those in my room?

12
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:58,327
Is there a safer place in Myoyeongak?

13
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:10,089
Can you give that to me?

14
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,219
My time travel started…

15
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,598
with this guardian stone.

16
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:23,519
Hong-joo, I can't go home without this.

17
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:28,482
That's why I will wipe out anyone
who gets in my way.

18
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:31,151
-Even me?
-Even you.

19
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:34,864
Can you handle it?

20
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:38,993
I'm going to the Bando Hotel.

21
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,287
Either Moo-yeong or the Governor-General,

22
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,748
tell whoever wants this
that I'll be at the Bando Hotel.

23
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,628
Because I don't intend to hide or run.

24
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:01,891
Hey, Moo-yeong.

25
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,853
You seem well, drinking in dire times.

26
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,813
Lee Yeon, how are you here?

27
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:10,608
Enough of that.
Let's give you a beating first.

28
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:17,072
You bastard.

29
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:00,449
Gosh, damn it.

30
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:08,958
How does it feel?

31
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,836
How does it feel to beat each other
with these hands we once used

32
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,338
to support each other with?

33
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:15,923
You here to preach?

34
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:21,845
I'm here to see how I'd feel doing this.
It's not as refreshing as I imagined.

35
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,722
That makes two of us.

36
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,143
Just pour me a drink.

37
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:29,561
-What?
-For your information,

38
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:32,189
I didn't bring the treasures
you're looking for.

39
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:33,857
Safety comes first.

40
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,828
-You have a guest, sir.
-Who is it?

41
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:49,164
It's been a while, demons.

42
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:57,881
To what do I owe the pleasure
of having Myoyeongak's Madame here?

43
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:00,843
I hear four new kids are sweeping
the Gyeongseong grounds.

44
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,137
-They're called Shinigami.
-Shinigami?

45
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:06,140
Which means the god of death?

46
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,725
Gosh, I don't like it.

47
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:12,938
But why come to me
instead of paying them a visit?

48
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:16,400
-Well, you brought them here.
-Oh, my.

49
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,902
You truly are the most informed in Joseon.

50
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,321
What do you want?

51
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,700
Mercenaries or whatever.
I'm not interested in all that.

52
00:05:26,452 --> 00:05:28,328
You're looking for the treasures,
aren't you?

53
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:33,167
If I help you get them,
what will you give me in return?

54
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:38,130
-What is it you want?
-Don't mess with Myoyeongak, or my girls.

55
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:41,967
So you're willing to join hands
with me to protect Myoyeongak?

56
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,887
So much for a mountain god of Joseon.

57
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:47,056
I never start a losing fight.

58
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,022
I'll ask you just once.

59
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,941
You in or out?

60
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,834
You plan to revive your brother
with the treasures?

61
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:19,838
-You crazy fool.
-Didn't your brother die in the year 2020?

62
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:22,800
If you had those items then,

63
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,762
-what choice would you have made?
-I would've been tempted.

64
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:33,644
But I'd make the same decision
if I were to face that moment again.

65
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,272
I'd wait for him to reincarnate,
and fight to gain virtue.

66
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:38,774
That's nothing new to me.

67
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,234
You always play by the book.

68
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:46,031
But that's exactly why
I became a mountain god.

69
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,785
I don't cross the line at any cost.

70
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,704
Say you turn into stone,
neither alive nor dead for centuries.

71
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:54,706
Then, that sort of crap is useless.

72
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:57,793
You chose that path.

73
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:01,964
If you break the taboo
and annihilate an entire mountain,

74
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,133
you should be prepared to pay.

75
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:11,181
-I am prepared. Back then and now.
-That's what matters.

76
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:16,603
Do your best to take the guardian stone
and the golden ruler from me.

77
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:18,939
And save your brother.

78
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:29,283
I'll risk my life to protect the treasures
and fight against you.

79
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,165
So today's the last time…

80
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:38,667
we drink together.

81
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:44,965
Thanks for the drinks.

82
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:52,806
-I'm going to the Bando Hotel.
-Let me ask you one thing.

83
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,562
What was I to you?

84
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:04,026
As you know, I was a perverse kid.

85
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:06,111
So self-centered too.

86
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:12,159
You taught me
how to fight to protect someone.

87
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,704
I wanted to be a mountain god like you.

88
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:22,753
How funny.
You always seemed to shine back then.

89
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:26,423
You were fearless
and always made your own decisions.

90
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:30,052
You… were my dream.

91
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,387
I guess that's why we were friends.

92
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:41,480
I'll get going.

93
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:03,210
-Will you hand over the treasures?
-Do you think I'm out of my mind?

94
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:05,796
The treasures are mine.

95
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:11,176
-Then why cooperate with him, ma'am?
-I'm trying to buy some time.

96
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:14,680
I want him to sit tight
while I take the treasures.

97
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,431
-Do you think he fell for it?
-No.

98
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:19,017
He's stronger and cleverer than expected.

99
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:23,188
-I might even take a hit.
-Are they worth all that trouble, ma'am?

100
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:26,608
Is it worth antagonizing the governor,
involving Lord Lee Yeon and--

101
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:30,404
Jae-yoo, say I get my hands on them.

102
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,906
Then, Yeon can't go home.

103
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,743
If all else fails,

104
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:42,416
we will leave this dreadful era
with the guardian stone,

105
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,334
and run off to a new world.

106
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,086
So starting now…

107
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,090
let's enter the eye of the storm.

108
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:02,728
Father.

109
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,189
Where have you been?

110
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,693
I got some clothes
at the department store. Oh, right.

111
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,780
I also got a tie for you.

112
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:17,909
Good. I'll wear that to your wedding.

113
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:21,955
My wedding? What are you talking about?

114
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,957
Get married and quit being a reporter.

115
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,543
Whom will I marry?

116
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:31,214
Your brother-in-law.
The ceremony will be this Sunday.

117
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:35,344
That's insane.
You must've lost your mind, Father.

118
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,764
Sis killed herself
after getting married to him!

119
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,518
Answer me.

120
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:50,233
The day the commander died
in the Gyeongseong Station bombing,

121
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,651
where were you?

122
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:01,661
Answer me!

123
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,539
Don't you already know?

124
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,210
You're right. I was there.

125
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:17,010
If only I had both my daughters…
I wouldn't have missed.

126
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,266
Honey, honey, please!
Please, let's talk instead!

127
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:35,320
No activists are welcome in my house!

128
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:44,454
Why did you do it?

129
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:47,958
We did everything for you, and yet--
The independence movement?

130
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,713
He's mistaken, huh? Tell me it's not true!

131
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,591
Sorry, Mother.

132
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,011
Ginko.

133
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,640
I'm not Ginko.

134
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,936
My name is Sunwoo Eun-ho.

135
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,154
Are we getting anywhere?

136
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:22,659
There are no survivors yet.
The longest to endure was about two days.

137
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,536
All their eardrums burst, so…

138
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:28,331
-Is it due to the gwiso tree?
-Yes, sir.

139
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,333
GWISO TREE
A HAUNTED WHISTLING TREE

140
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:31,835
WHERE THOSE WHO HEAR IT GO MAD

141
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:40,135
Injecting them with the sap of this tree
messes with their heads.

142
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:45,390
The problem is that they die
when they hear the whistles, no?

143
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:47,642
I apologize, sir.

144
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:53,106
If you don't obtain good results,
the next test subject…

145
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,651
will be you, Akira.

146
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,780
I will definitely make it a success, sir!

147
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:08,538
Did you call for us?

148
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:14,377
You have a new mission.
Bring me the nine-tailed fox's treasures.

149
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:19,883
Can I bring you the treasures
and keep the nine-tailed fox perhaps?

150
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,970
She's speaking nonsense, sir.

151
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:27,057
You saw him up close. What was he like?

152
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:31,228
He uses his head
like a well-oiled machine.

153
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:35,398
He was fighting a losing battle,
but he turned the tables in an instant.

154
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,484
He is a mountain god of Joseon.

155
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:39,736
You think you can handle him?

156
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:42,489
Leave it to me, sir.

157
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:49,412
-He'll be going to the Bando Hotel.
-Yes, sir!

158
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,998
HANGMYEONOK NOODLES

159
00:13:57,796 --> 00:14:00,840
You dare summon the owner
of the Stream of the Dead?

160
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,134
Have a bowl of naengmyeon.

161
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:05,303
Here, try some.

162
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,357
What do you think?

163
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,985
It's nice and refreshing, but…

164
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:24,030
What is your motive?

165
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:28,243
Japanese demons are wiping out
our indigenous gods.

166
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:32,581
You think my thousand-mile eyes
are just for decoration?

167
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,045
Let's be honest.
You're frustrated too, aren't you?

168
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:44,259
You hate that you can only watch as
the invaders turn everything to ruins, no?

169
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,180
We do not interfere in human affairs.

170
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,350
That is the rule.

171
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:56,730
But, like you said, I don't belong here.

172
00:14:57,314 --> 00:15:00,025
I'm just a traveler
passing through this era.

173
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,154
What are you planning now?

174
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:07,866
I'm going to kill all the Japanese demons
before I go home.

175
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:12,621
You only need to hush yourself
until you return, but how--

176
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:16,666
It's something only I can do.
And something I should've done before.

177
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:22,964
I have a debt to settle
in this era, old hag.

178
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,969
I'll take that as a "yes."

179
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:35,644
Is this it?

180
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:41,608
The reason my future self
sent Yeon to this era.

181
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:55,497
Gosh. It's almost time to say farewell
to this landscape too.

182
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:05,632
D-4 DAYS

183
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,968
You're suddenly going to a hotel?
What about me?

184
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:12,514
-You don't need to come.
-What?

185
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:16,184
Everyone will swarm to the place
for the guardian stone and golden ruler.

186
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,478
It's safer to stay away from me for now.

187
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,731
-Damn it.
-You're so annoying.

188
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,275
You also looking down on me
because I'm a half-fox?

189
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:29,572
-Me?
-Then, why don't you turn to me once?

190
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,705
I want to. I'd like to depend on you too.

191
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,082
But you're my only weakness here.

192
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,501
If you get hurt again,
I will lose it this time.

193
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,839
I'm not the kid you used to piggyback.

194
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:50,885
The least you can do
is let me decide my own path.

195
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:57,684
You don't have much time left, no?
Don't regret it later on.

196
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:02,397
Fine, let's go together.
You stick right next to me.

197
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,442
-All right! Let me go!
-Lord Lee Yeon!

198
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:06,901
-Go away!
-Yeah?

199
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:11,990
How nice.

200
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:15,410
-She says to have a farewell party.
-Hong-joo?

201
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,828
Yes, and this is for you.

202
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,832
-Information on the Japanese demons.
-Right.

203
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:29,132
-Why me?
-I picked you to marry from the start.

204
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:33,720
But your sister brought it on herself,
when she said she'd marry me instead.

205
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,972
I don't know where,
and what rumor she heard,

206
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,433
but she already knew

207
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,020
that I'm not one of the good guys.

208
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:46,357
That's why she married you in my place?

209
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:49,068
Perhaps she wanted
to protect her only sister, though…

210
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:51,946
she couldn't protect her own life.

211
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:54,240
You killed her, huh?

212
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:13,676
Well, your sister saw things
she shouldn't have.

213
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:19,808
That's why she died.

214
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:23,102
I'll kill you!

215
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,610
A new bride shouldn't be carrying guns.

216
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,695
I won't marry you to save my life.

217
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:41,496
But you will.

218
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:55,510
What's with the long face?

219
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:59,264
-I got cut before the preliminary rounds.
-How come?

220
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:03,560
A gisaeng from Pyongyang, and an actress
who models for some soap, got picked.

221
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,439
But they said they wanted a singer…

222
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:19,784
-Get in.
-I don't feel like watching a movie.

223
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:24,163
Let's go see something else, then.

224
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,462
Wow, it's the ocean!

225
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:41,055
It's been so long
since I've smelled the ocean.

226
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:47,979
You like it that much?

227
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:52,233
I missed it.

228
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,155
So much that I even heard the sound
of waves in my dreams.

229
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:01,409
How did you think to bring me here?

230
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:06,331
I may not know much about women,
but I felt a mermaid would miss the sea.

231
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:10,585
Like how I sometimes miss the forest
from when I was with Lee Yeon.

232
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:18,801
I've forgotten all about getting cut.

233
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:24,557
Let's walk together.

234
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:34,984
Must you really fight?

235
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,236
Unlike you, I don't like Joseon.

236
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:42,241
I don't have many good memories of
being born as a half-blood, either.

237
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:48,581
But for the first time, there's something
I want to protect on this ravaged land.

238
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,544
Then let's fight together.

239
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:55,797
-You can't.
-Rang.

240
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,759
If something happens to you,
I won't be able to live a single day.

241
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:02,303
I've been on the brink of death
countless times.

242
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,347
And I survived every time.

243
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,142
As long as Lee Yeon's with me,
I will never die.

244
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:11,270
That's what it must feel like
to have a sibling.

245
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,566
I, too, had a family once.

246
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:20,405
I'll be your family, then.

247
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:23,491
Really?

248
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:29,872
Once everything is solved,
I'll quit the gang and find a new job.

249
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,795
Well, should I just open a record label?

250
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,424
I'll hold you to that.

251
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:18,087
-What are you asking me to sell?
-A Myoyeongak brunch.

252
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,966
To increase sales,
you must diversify the menu.

253
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,761
Give off a trendy vibe.
Offer delivery services too.

254
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,554
This is a high-end restaurant.

255
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:31,350
In the future where I'm from,
even Michelin restaurants deliver food.

256
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:33,811
-Who's doing the deliveries?
-Yeah, who?

257
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:38,858
Use my guys from the bandit gang.
They're fleet-footed, you know.

258
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:41,319
-You're quitting the bandit gang?
-It's a thought.

259
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:43,738
Wow, I'm so proud. Here, have a drink!

260
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:47,033
There's a good boy.

261
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:56,793
Who came during the day?

262
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:03,424
-I had a drink with Lee Yeon.
-What?

263
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:07,345
To declare war.
We've really become enemies now.

264
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:09,222
Don't get swayed, Moo-yeong!

265
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,226
If that were possible,
I wouldn't have come so far.

266
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:17,355
You must kill Lee Yeon
and get your hands on the treasures.

267
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:19,941
But Ho-yeong…

268
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:23,569
Back then…

269
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,198
Why did you try to kill me?

270
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:30,868
I told you, I wasn't in my right mind.
It was all Taluipa's doing.

271
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:32,912
To prevent our tiger clan
from gaining power.

272
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,331
-To annihilate us--
-No, I don't understand.

273
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,542
Taluipa dearly cared for me.

274
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,211
Then, would she have turned you
into stone to rot?

275
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:44,715
She needed a hostage from the start.
That's why she raised you to be a god.

276
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:52,598
Okay. I'll retrieve all that we've lost.

277
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:55,101
That's my little brother.

278
00:23:57,145 --> 00:24:00,565
I'll bring the guardian stone
and the golden ruler.

279
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,122
Move. That's my seat.

280
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:19,709
-What are you doing?
-There are seats in the back.

281
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,464
Let's go.

282
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:28,426
Didn't we have
a farewell party last night?

283
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:32,054
I spent all night thinking,
and concluded I can't let you go just yet.

284
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,599
-It rips my heart to shreds.
-Say that again.

285
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:37,977
What about Myoyeongak?

286
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,313
Temporarily closed.
Everyone's coming to the hotel.

287
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,982
I booked your rooms too.

288
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:45,484
Let's get going.

289
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,879
-I'll check us in. Take a look around.
-All right.

290
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:08,090
This looks better than I thought.

291
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:14,931
-Your name, ma'am?
-Don't you know me? It's Ryu Hong-joo.

292
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,684
Four rooms for ten guests, correct?

293
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:23,105
I want them all next to each other.

294
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:25,358
The upper floor looks cool too.

295
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:27,777
I'm so sorry, sir.

296
00:25:30,655 --> 00:25:32,365
What's this?

297
00:25:33,658 --> 00:25:35,451
"The technique of hypnotism"?

298
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:38,412
We're the best hypnotism society
in all of Joseon.

299
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:42,583
This book is where our president
exposes the secrets of the Heavens.

300
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,337
-Buy me one.
-It's all a scam, you brat.

301
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,257
It's not a scam!
If you learn the art of hypnosis,

302
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:53,386
you can heal all diseases
and even communicate with ghosts.

303
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,889
You can even create
a thunderstorm in the clear sky.

304
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:59,600
-Gosh.
-This guy can do that, you know.

305
00:25:59,684 --> 00:26:02,687
-Pardon?
-Who would ever believe this stuff?

306
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:04,605
Hey, get back to work.

307
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:21,831
Stop!

308
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,836
Geez, you ignorant bastard.
It's your damn shoes!

309
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:29,880
Why are you cursing, all of a sudden?

310
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:32,466
No, I'm telling you. It's your shoes!

311
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:36,512
It's good manners to take off your shoes
when entering a hotel, you know?

312
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:41,350
I knew that, okay?

313
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,859
-No, wait--
-Oh, boss! Boss!

314
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:52,111
Damn it.

315
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:56,574
-Why did you take off your shoes?
-Is this your first time in a hotel, huh?

316
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:58,117
These are proper manners.

317
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,203
Look. They're all wearing shoes,
except for you.

318
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:03,039
-Who told you that?
-Koo Shin-ju…

319
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:08,002
Why you sly little-- Come here!

320
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:09,962
Hey, everyone.

321
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:17,762
-The fox brothers are in Room 304.
-Okay.

322
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:20,639
-And you?
-Room 301.

323
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:24,018
See you later, baby.

324
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:30,441
Well, she came here determined.

325
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:33,861
Don't let your guard down.
It will be a bloody night.

326
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,075
HAIR SALON

327
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:49,085
The Bando Hotel, please.

328
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,597
OBOK BOUTIQUE

329
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:04,767
How do I look?

330
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,061
Yuki is pretty.

331
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:08,604
Is that all you can say?

332
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,024
Isn't there anything raunchy and dramatic?

333
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:14,985
I'm going to a hotel today
to meet a freakin' handsome demon.

334
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:18,364
What exactly are you guys?

335
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:21,200
What do you mean "what"?
We're demons just like you.

336
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,495
What is her original form?

337
00:28:30,418 --> 00:28:31,502
A water snail bride.

338
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,967
Water snail bride, what are your talents?

339
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,139
Sewing and cooking. That's all.

340
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,723
Should I drag her out?

341
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:52,606
Did I practice singing too much?
My throat is burning.

342
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:00,614
Ma'am!

343
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,952
-What's going on? What happened?
-I was almost taken by a Japanese demon.

344
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:06,662
A Japanese demon?

345
00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:10,416
For the time being,
don't go out recklessly.

346
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:18,090
-Where did they go?
-They've all flocked to the Bando Hotel.

347
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:20,843
The Bando Hotel? Rang is there.

348
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:22,845
I'll be right back.

349
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:24,889
You can't go!

350
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:26,891
Yeo-hee!

351
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:31,312
Oh, wow!

352
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:34,356
Wow! It's a bed, a hotel bed!

353
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,524
BANDO HOTEL, ROOM 302

354
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:37,067
-Wow.
-This hotel!

355
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:39,195
There's even soap in the room!

356
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,697
You think that's all?
This room costs a fortune!

357
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,034
-How much is it?
-I'm guessing around a month's salary.

358
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,544
What's that? Is it kimchi?

359
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:58,672
Apricot, who brings kimchi to a hotel?

360
00:29:58,756 --> 00:30:01,759
I heard they only sell Western food,
so I packed some just in case.

361
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:05,971
Gosh, it's not my fault
if they treat us like hillbillies.

362
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,559
Hey, hey! This is theft!

363
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:11,852
BANDO HOTEL, ROOM 303

364
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:15,231
-My job is to thieve. Let go!
-Gosh, what are you doing?

365
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,441
Let go. I'm just doing my job.

366
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:20,277
That's right. Wow!

367
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:21,904
Stop it. That's enough!

368
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:25,824
The painting.
Hey, leave me be-- The painting-- Whoa!

369
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:29,495
-Oh, why can't I take this off?
-Paintings aren't amenities, seriously!

370
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:32,164
-I'll be in the Madame's room.
-Jae-yoo, help!

371
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:35,501
Hey, you bastard!

372
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:38,337
Let go. Let go. Let go.

373
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:43,425
Hey, don't forget our objective here.

374
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:47,263
-You think I'm stupid?
-Yeah.

375
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,315
Was it right to bring the gisaengs here?

376
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,650
BANDO HOTEL, ROOM 301

377
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:03,112
The Governor-General would've got to them
if they knew I left Myoyeongak.

378
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:07,157
-You all should stay right by me.
-What is your plan?

379
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:12,997
I'll snatch the treasure
while Yeon and Moo-yeong are fighting.

380
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:17,418
Until then, you go and have fun.

381
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:31,307
-What's this?
-It's an invitation to our society's--

382
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,391
Get lost.

383
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:46,238
Lee Yeon, it's over now.

384
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:48,449
BANDO HOTEL, ROOM 403

385
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:49,950
Nyudo.

386
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:53,746
Nyudo! Let's hurry and go catch them.

387
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:55,581
Let's go! Let's go!

388
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:59,752
We start work at sundown.
Those are the boss's orders.

389
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:05,007
In that case,
maybe we should rest while we can?

390
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:13,390
Coming in.

391
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:43,545
Rang. Do you want to come with me?

392
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:48,258
-Where to?
-Where I come from. The future of Joseon.

393
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:52,054
There is no gunfire or war there.

394
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:54,473
-No Japanese invaders either.
-I can't go.

395
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:58,394
Because of the mermaid lady?

396
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:04,817
Be good to that mermaid lady.

397
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,695
Protect her with your life.

398
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,574
A nine-tailed fox's first love
is their last and final love.

399
00:33:19,707 --> 00:33:21,333
All right, here.

400
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,962
I wanted to give it to you before I left.

401
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:32,970
-Rings?
-Yes.

402
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,848
It's my wedding gift to you
as your brother.

403
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:37,474
One for each of you.

404
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:50,446
We have quite a number
of uninvited guests.

405
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,952
I wonder how many of them
will make it out alive?

406
00:33:57,578 --> 00:34:00,247
Do I look merciful to you?

407
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:09,339
D-3 DAYS

408
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:12,176
Gosh, this is so fun.
Let's go one more time.

409
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:15,095
-Hey, get back in.
-I can't-- I just can't.

410
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:17,806
-Jae-yoo, what's wrong?
-This man right here.

411
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:21,268
He thinks riding elevators is so fun,
he's made me ride it ten times!

412
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:24,104
Look here. He's weaker than he looks.

413
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:26,482
-Are you here for the lecture?
-No.

414
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:28,442
But you should come.

415
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:30,861
We're giving out free drinks, too.

416
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:32,446
Hypnotism?

417
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:36,408
They're giving free coffee.
Why don't we drink a cup each, huh?

418
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:39,912
-Let's drink. Drink.
-Come in.

419
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,790
You can sit right over there.
There at the end.

420
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:45,417
Whoa, so this is where you all were?

421
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:48,462
-The lecture started.
-Fine. I get it.

422
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:50,047
HYPNOTISM SOCIETY OF JOSEON

423
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,966
Bonjour, mademoiselle. Bonjour, monsieur.

424
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,468
Do you know who I am?

425
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:58,222
I'm the Hypnotism Society of Joseon's
president, Christian Park.

426
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:00,474
I'm glad to meet you all

427
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,309
-at a rendezvous like this.
-Bravo.

428
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:12,820
You are a torchbearer in the Olympics.

429
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:16,698
Amidst the ardent cheers of the crowd,
you appear with the torch…

430
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:23,372
to relay it right now!

431
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:29,211
-What?
-Oh, wow!

432
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:36,760
Okay, look here.

433
00:35:36,844 --> 00:35:41,306
As you can see,
hypnotism isn't some lousy technique.

434
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,724
It's not magic either.

435
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:46,520
It's a medical practice for the psyche
all the way from Europe.

436
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:47,604
Wow.

437
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:50,607
All right.

438
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:54,653
What happened?

439
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:59,950
When you are under hypnotism,
you can become anything.

440
00:36:00,868 --> 00:36:03,912
You become someone that you are not!

441
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:07,207
-They're all in on it.
-What do you know?

442
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:09,960
He says it's a new medical practice
from Europe.

443
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:13,088
Now, who wants to try it out
for themselves?

444
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,923
Oh, me!

445
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:23,807
What should I transform
these beautiful mademoiselles into?

446
00:36:30,731 --> 00:36:34,401
-Put all your valuables in here, now!
-What's all the fuss?

447
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:37,070
I'll cut your throat
if I find you hiding anything.

448
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,489
Honey, call the police!

449
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,951
Her brother is a cop, damn it!

450
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:46,121
Boss, you should cut her finger off
to set an example.

451
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,831
-You crazy bitches!
-Hey, hey!

452
00:36:47,915 --> 00:36:51,376
Hey, hey! What's wrong?
Are you girls drunk?

453
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,337
-Okay, let's go inside.
-Please help!

454
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:56,632
They must be drunk. Sorry about that.

455
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:57,883
This is our turf.

456
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:01,303
This isn't the place
for the Madame's chick to butt in.

457
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:04,389
-Chick? Huh?
-Don't interfere, or else!

458
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:07,142
-I might just bury you alive.
-Hey, got a smoke?

459
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:09,895
-Say wh--
-You're still wet behind the ears!

460
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:14,566
Can you see it?
Can you see if it's still wet or not, huh?

461
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,526
-Oh, my.
-I think they've all lost it.

462
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:19,655
I can't teach them a lesson either.
Just go get Hong-joo.

463
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:22,282
-Yes, Hong-joo.
-Just wait until she gets here.

464
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:26,286
-How dare you ask for a smoke!
-She's not here.

465
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:30,207
-Find Jae-yoo. Guys, will you stop!
-Jae-yoo. Find Jae-yoo!

466
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:32,918
Hey, come out here!

467
00:37:35,796 --> 00:37:37,255
Hello?

468
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:49,685
I'm floating, I'm floating--
Float, float, float!

469
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:50,978
Are you levitating?

470
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:54,231
Man, this is weird.

471
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:58,485
I've hypnotized everyone I've seen today,
but how come I can't do this?

472
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:02,531
Maybe you used up too much energy.

473
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:06,618
Whatever the case, I think you're right.

474
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,915
We could have a good run today,
since the hotel's built on expensive land.

475
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:17,337
You must've gotten a spiritual awakening,
while scamming everyone.

476
00:38:17,421 --> 00:38:20,215
-I'm floating, floating--
-Yes, you're floating.

477
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:23,510
-You're floating, floating.
-I'm floating, floating!

478
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:27,889
Did you mess with my henchman?

479
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:29,933
Who are you to talk so rudely--

480
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:31,643
-You prick!
-Let's talk!

481
00:38:31,727 --> 00:38:35,022
-Now who the hell are you?
-Please, let's talk instead!

482
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:37,274
-I'm the only son in the family line.
-Damn it!

483
00:38:38,692 --> 00:38:40,652
Hypnosis or not, just undo it.

484
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,615
Wait! Look at this pocket watch closely.

485
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:48,035
Why? You going to hypnotize me too?

486
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:50,120
You are now afraid of me.

487
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:52,289
Why would I be?

488
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:57,085
Since I've taken away your courage
through hypnosis. Three, two, one. Bam!

489
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:02,549
Gosh, seriously?

490
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:05,927
You think that will work on me?
Hurry up and undo it.

491
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:15,145
Since today's a special day,
the hotel's running wild with peddlers.

492
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:17,272
-Peddlers?
-Something like that.

493
00:39:19,608 --> 00:39:22,986
-Are the preparations going well?
-You didn't have to come.

494
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:29,493
We're on the same side, no?
I'll help you with your treasure hunt.

495
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:31,203
No, you stay out of this.

496
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:33,705
I don't like you getting hurt.

497
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:39,419
I appreciate your concern,
but like I said, don't tell me what to do.

498
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:44,257
So how do we take the treasures?

499
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:46,635
I doubt Yeon will give it to us
without a fight.

500
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:49,888
I have a plan.

501
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:52,224
And what's that?

502
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:56,186
When the sun sets today…

503
00:40:08,532 --> 00:40:09,616
You heard him, right?

504
00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:13,245
Whatever happens here tonight,
stay out of it.

505
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,373
Take care of the girls.

506
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:19,084
Can't you take me with you?

507
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,091
Don't risk your life so easily.

508
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:28,969
Find someone worth risking your life for.

509
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:42,107
My apologies.

510
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,191
Excuse me.

511
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:12,304
-Are you here to play?
-Our excessive greed caused this disaster.

512
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:16,683
That's-- That's right.
We were on the lookout for anyone fishy.

513
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:20,687
-Just remove the damn makeup.
-Quickly. I can't look at you both.

514
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:25,275
-Oh, my-- Take them off over there.
-Sir.

515
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:27,444
MOO-YEONG - MERCENARIES
HONG-JOO - GIRLS - SHIN-JU

516
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:28,528
Let's gather.

517
00:41:28,612 --> 00:41:29,613
JAE-YOO - LEE YEON

518
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:34,576
As expected,
everyone's here for the treasures.

519
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:38,413
Not just the Japanese demons,
but also Hong-joo and Moo-yeong.

520
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:42,459
-Anything on Hong-joo?
-She met Lord Moo-yeong earlier,

521
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:43,793
and hasn't left her room since.

522
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:46,046
-And Moo-yeong?
-He left just now.

523
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,799
-To where?
-How would I know?

524
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:53,762
The Japanese demons seem
to be staying put in their rooms.

525
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:58,892
Okay, our first target
is the Shinigami mercenaries.

526
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:03,021
The Japanese demons wreaking havoc
in Joseon these days.

527
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:04,189
MOO-YEONG 403 - MERCENARIES 404

528
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:05,774
Room 404.

529
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,487
I haven't gotten physical in so long.

530
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:14,824
-No. I do the hunting alone.
-What?

531
00:42:14,908 --> 00:42:17,744
Research tells me they're quite strong.
You can't do it alone.

532
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:21,164
And what if the mountain gods chip in?

533
00:42:21,248 --> 00:42:24,042
Four Japanese demons
and two mountain gods. It's six to one.

534
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,129
That's the real goal of this operation.

535
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:32,050
I'm not following at all.

536
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:36,763
Well, like you just said,
the mercenaries are strong.

537
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:41,184
It might be impossible for me
to face the four of them overnight.

538
00:42:41,268 --> 00:42:42,560
But what if…

539
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:47,023
Hong-joo and Moo-yeong…

540
00:42:49,276 --> 00:42:50,360
side with us?

541
00:42:51,528 --> 00:42:52,612
What if this becomes

542
00:42:52,696 --> 00:42:56,116
a battle between the mercenaries
and the mountain gods?

543
00:42:56,825 --> 00:43:00,287
They're all going rabid for the items,
while Cheon Moo-yeong is out to kill you.

544
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:04,416
And Madame Ryu's priority is Myoyeongak.
She'd never oppose the Governor-General.

545
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:05,834
How's that even possible?

546
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:09,212
I will make it possible.

547
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:13,008
When will you begin?

548
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:14,384
When Moo-yeong comes back.

549
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:30,734
You may eat to your heart's content today.

550
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:43,538
What--

551
00:43:44,706 --> 00:43:48,418
-Why are you here?
-Did you die too, comrade?

552
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:51,546
Well, that's quite a long story.

553
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,548
What happened to you?

554
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,176
That's not the problem.
Comrade Eun-ho is in danger.

555
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,220
She's being forced
to marry the Chief Commissioner.

556
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:03,183
-The man from the Government-General?
-That man knows everything.

557
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:08,646
-You know this man?
-No.

558
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,442
Stop slacking off and let him in.
The dead will come swarming in soon.

559
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:13,860
Yes, honey.

560
00:44:34,214 --> 00:44:35,340
Wear this as you go.

561
00:44:35,924 --> 00:44:39,386
It'll be fairly cold on your way
across the Stream of the Dead.

562
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:42,013
Who are you, comrade?

563
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:45,183
Whoever I may be…

564
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:51,314
It doesn't change the fact
that we fought for Joseon together.

565
00:44:52,482 --> 00:44:57,362
My only regret is not seeing
the independence of Joseon.

566
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:00,990
You've had a good run.

567
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:11,876
Are you crying?

568
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,796
A god that oversees the dead
is crying over a human crossing?

569
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:18,341
I know, right?

570
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:23,847
I should be getting used to this by now.

571
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:37,402
These are difficult times.
For both the gods and the humans.

572
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:39,154
Still, keep yourself out of it.

573
00:45:42,574 --> 00:45:43,741
Yeon will do it.

574
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:49,789
What? Yeon will? And you allowed it?

575
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:55,086
I doubt the world will turn upside down.

576
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:59,549
But for once, I want to place my bet.

577
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:05,388
That Joseon will win.

578
00:46:31,873 --> 00:46:33,291
Cheon Moo-yeong is back.

579
00:46:36,044 --> 00:46:39,839
Shin-ju, go outside now
and shut off the electricity at 7:00 p.m.

580
00:46:39,923 --> 00:46:42,258
-Why?
-So the other guests stay in their rooms.

581
00:46:43,092 --> 00:46:44,844
-The innocent should stay safe.
-Sir.

582
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:48,806
And the treasures?

583
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:51,434
Here.

584
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:55,438
I just tell the two mountain gods
that you wish to see them in Room 404?

585
00:46:56,272 --> 00:46:59,692
Also, forget about fighting them.

586
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:03,905
-If you see that happening--
-Okay, I'll avoid them at all costs.

587
00:47:05,198 --> 00:47:06,199
You.

588
00:47:06,908 --> 00:47:10,078
If your boss gets so much as a nosebleed,
I will go berserk.

589
00:47:10,912 --> 00:47:11,913
I understand, sir.

590
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,033
Lee Yeon wants to see you in Room 404.

591
00:49:15,078 --> 00:49:16,412
Rang.

592
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:18,831
I looked everywhere for you.

593
00:49:18,915 --> 00:49:22,919
-Why are you here?
-The Japanese demons came to the boutique.

594
00:49:23,503 --> 00:49:25,713
What? Are you hurt?

595
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:29,092
I'm fine, but I heard they all came here.

596
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:31,844
I was worried about you, so…

597
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,514
You can't be here.

598
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:41,896
No.

599
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:05,753
Excuse me.

600
00:50:47,712 --> 00:50:50,548
They were definitely here.

601
00:50:51,174 --> 00:50:52,884
They never left this room either.

602
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:46,813
One of them knows
how to use the illusion charm, huh?

603
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:49,273
ILLUSION CHARM - CHARM CREATING
AN ILLUSION LIKE REALITY

604
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:52,902
Where are you?

605
00:51:53,903 --> 00:51:55,363
You cunning bastard.

606
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:21,013
What's with the power outage
in such an expensive room?

607
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:25,101
What's that noise?

608
00:52:29,856 --> 00:52:32,817
Apricot, you go ask the concierge
to switch our rooms.

609
00:52:53,421 --> 00:52:54,964
The hallway lights are out too.

610
00:53:08,978 --> 00:53:12,189
Excuse me.
Is the power out in your room too?

611
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:34,253
-Hey, why is it so dark?
-Watch your step.

612
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:37,381
Oh, dear.

613
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:49,977
President, sir!

614
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:54,190
Get off, off!

615
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,151
What's going on?

616
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:01,155
-Those things respond to noise.
-What was that girl just now?

617
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:02,949
A Yacha.

618
00:54:04,492 --> 00:54:08,412
The demon that feeds on humans?
Why is such a thing in this hotel?

619
00:54:10,498 --> 00:54:11,999
You will be fine.

620
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:15,336
Do not leave this room until I call you.

621
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:08,097
-Sir, please wait--
-Move.

622
00:55:10,683 --> 00:55:12,518
What's that? You okay, miss?

623
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:02,109
What on earth is that monster?

624
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:07,948
A human that fed on a Yacha's flesh
and blood for a fortnight.

625
00:56:09,909 --> 00:56:12,995
With her memories gone,
she's like any other Yacha.

626
00:56:13,496 --> 00:56:17,625
-A monster that only thirsts for blood.
-Why sacrifice the innocent?

627
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:18,709
If Taluipa finds out--

628
00:56:18,793 --> 00:56:22,004
I'll deal with that.
You didn't know about this, okay?

629
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,344
Yeon is in that room.

630
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:49,258
Damn it, where are you?

631
00:57:49,758 --> 00:57:51,260
Gosh, seriously.

632
00:57:57,391 --> 00:57:59,518
You came alone? Where's Hong-joo?

633
00:58:01,604 --> 00:58:04,315
This forest. Is this your doing?

634
00:58:05,149 --> 00:58:07,693
Not me, no.
The hotel's got some uninvited guests.

635
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:12,198
Do you even have time for this?
Clueless about your brother, huh?

636
00:58:13,741 --> 00:58:16,035
What did you do to him, huh?

637
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:19,163
-I freed a Yacha at the hotel.
-A Yacha?

638
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:20,915
Your brother must be quite busy now.

639
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:24,168
He bumped into his girlfriend
as the guests turned into Yachas.

640
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:30,799
-Gosh. How did you become so twisted?
-Well, I have nothing to protect.

641
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:34,553
Hand over the treasure
if you want to save your brother.

642
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:36,972
-No.
-What?

643
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:39,266
Though he's a half,
he's still a nine-tailed fox.

644
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:41,393
He's not as weak as you think.

645
00:58:41,477 --> 00:58:43,562
Especially with a woman to protect.

646
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:48,400
It can't be helped then.

647
00:58:49,485 --> 00:58:51,570
I'm not here to fight you.

648
00:58:51,654 --> 00:58:54,114
But who cares who I fight first, right?

649
00:58:56,242 --> 00:58:57,618
Bring it on.

650
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:05,209
A hibari.

651
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:06,919
It's a hibari chirping.

652
00:59:08,462 --> 00:59:10,297
What was it in Korean?

653
00:59:10,381 --> 00:59:11,674
Skylark, you idiot.

654
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:17,388
You just had to choose this picture, huh?
We can't even see where he is.

655
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:20,766
-Lee Yeon must've fell for it, right?
-This is the boss's illusion charm.

656
00:59:21,517 --> 00:59:24,895
He may be a clever nine-tailed fox,
but he won't be escaping this.

657
00:59:26,522 --> 00:59:28,691
Let's go catch the nine-tailed fox.

658
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:32,653
Wait for the boss to come.

659
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:36,573
Hey, can I have one?

660
00:59:36,657 --> 00:59:40,744
We're letting the boss have all the fun?
But we waited all day!

661
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:45,833
The target isn't him.
It's the treasures he has.

662
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:48,794
Must we yield such valuables
to the Governor-General?

663
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:51,880
We have to follow orders.

664
00:59:51,964 --> 00:59:54,675
Treasures or whatever, I don't care!

665
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:57,011
I want to play with the nine-tailed fox!

666
00:59:57,094 --> 01:00:00,139
-I'm telling the boss on you.
-So petty.

667
01:00:07,396 --> 01:00:08,647
Ushiuchibo?

668
01:00:09,982 --> 01:00:11,358
Where are you going?

669
01:00:12,026 --> 01:00:13,193
Number one.

670
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:45,684
Kids.

671
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:47,770
The treasures are mine.

672
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:52,941
Damn it, really!

673
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:55,819
My goodness!

674
01:01:08,957 --> 01:01:11,126
Oh, shit-- Hey, you go that way.

675
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:13,295
What am I, your underling?

676
01:01:13,379 --> 01:01:14,963
You and your complexes.

677
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:20,677
Ouch!

678
01:01:23,305 --> 01:01:25,557
Hey, stay down for a while.

679
01:01:29,061 --> 01:01:30,729
-Hey!
-Sorry.

680
01:01:33,107 --> 01:01:34,566
Hey!

681
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:38,946
Hong-joo!

682
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:41,031
Hey, what's wrong? What is it?

683
01:01:41,115 --> 01:01:43,158
My leg. I think my leg is broken.

684
01:01:43,242 --> 01:01:45,869
You're hurt? Where?
Your leg or your ank--?

685
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:50,040
Our dear Moo-yeong's weakness is me!
Sorry about this.

686
01:01:58,632 --> 01:01:59,883
Thank you.

687
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:03,804
No! Oh, shit!

688
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:08,475
Damn it.

689
01:02:09,268 --> 01:02:11,770
Damn it! Hey, you little--

690
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:19,528
-Damn it! Whose side are you on?
-You just smashed my head with a boulder.

691
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:23,657
Why the timid attitude, tiger?

692
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:26,910
Hey! Bring it.

693
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:30,205
As if! You really wanna try me, huh?

694
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:34,626
Guys.

695
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:36,503
Don't breathe!

696
01:02:37,171 --> 01:02:40,299
-Quit playing games.
-Hurry. Look behind you!

697
01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:31,433
One of them has crawled out at last.

698
01:03:36,188 --> 01:03:40,901
TALE OF THE NINE TAILED

699
01:04:04,091 --> 01:04:05,551
Hand over the treasures.

700
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:07,594
Yeo-hee!

701
01:04:07,678 --> 01:04:09,471
Then I'll spare their lives.

702
01:04:09,555 --> 01:04:11,890
You won't die. I won't let you.

703
01:04:11,974 --> 01:04:13,475
The mercenaries will come on his call.

704
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:15,477
I'll be the bait.

705
01:04:15,561 --> 01:04:18,021
-This represents my love.
-Hey, hey!

706
01:04:18,105 --> 01:04:19,481
The pistil of an iris.

707
01:04:19,565 --> 01:04:20,566
Will that work?

708
01:04:20,649 --> 01:04:22,109
It's in the hotel restaurant!

709
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:24,778
Now we rattle them from this side.

710
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,530
Strangely, I have a bad feeling.

711
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:29,366
-Are you the boss?
-I like you.

712
01:04:30,117 --> 01:04:31,451
-What?
-It means,

713
01:04:31,535 --> 01:04:32,953
I'm a body-switching demon.

714
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:34,997
I got you.

715
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,666
Being a mountain god of Joseon
means nothing.

716
01:04:38,292 --> 01:04:41,295
