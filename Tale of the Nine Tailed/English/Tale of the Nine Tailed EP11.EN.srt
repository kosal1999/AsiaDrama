1
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:56,974
TALE OF THE NINE TAILED

2
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:04,356
The Shinigami Mercenaries
have five members, not four.

3
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,858
Then where is--

4
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:09,069
Don't tell me…

5
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:13,115
What are you doing?
Quick, let's go to Boss.

6
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:29,381
We're back up to four mercenaries,
and the boss is a powerful illusionist.

7
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:33,844
If I don't return to my body
before he joins them…

8
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:40,601
Let's catch them ourselves.
The fox and the mountain gods.

9
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:43,062
What? But why?

10
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:45,689
They killed Ushiuchibo and got me too.

11
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,025
And we only have one treasure.

12
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:52,196
What would Boss say to that?

13
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:55,241
It's scary when Boss gets mad.

14
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,369
Gather around.

15
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:04,792
From now on, you guys…

16
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:09,463
Wait. Where's the guardian stone?

17
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:10,673
EPISODE 11

18
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:14,802
You said they attacked you.
You lost it to them?

19
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:19,014
That's what I should be asking.
What did you do to my guardian stone, huh?

20
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,146
What? I mean,
the one who got it stolen is the fool, no?

21
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:29,358
It was you, huh?

22
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,696
-Give it.
-Give what?

23
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:34,905
Give me my treasure.

24
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:37,241
You said
let's catch the mercenaries first!

25
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:40,035
-Where did you hide it? Hand it over!
-Gosh, it's mine!

26
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:41,495
-No, it's mine!
-Give it!

27
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,455
Where do you think you're touching?

28
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,504
Why are they fighting each other?

29
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:54,300
What does it matter?
Nyudo will take care of the fox.

30
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:57,803
You take the girl
and I'll take him over there.

31
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,474
I told you, it's mine.

32
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,481
They're here.

33
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:23,454
What's this now?

34
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,756
-Your opponent is me.
-Bring it.

35
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:39,678
We have another fine young man.
But Yuki is no child!

36
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:51,440
I already know of your talents, Yuki-onna.

37
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:24,682
I want that body too.

38
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:38,195
You shit!

39
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:44,910
Darn it!

40
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:46,996
Why you--

41
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,708
Why, why?

42
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:57,423
-You idiot! I'm Nyudo!
-Nyudo is with us!

43
00:04:57,506 --> 00:05:01,427
-That guy is the nine-tailed fox!
-You liar. I'm not stupid!

44
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,262
Gosh, you freakin' idiot.

45
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:08,600
Yeon, strike him!

46
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:19,862
No!

47
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:22,781
Ice.

48
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,499
Yeon.

49
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,251
Why would you--

50
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:40,257
I'm not Lee Yeon.
I'm Nyudo of the Shinigami Mercenaries.

51
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:11,914
Thanks. You all can go now.

52
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:33,310
Here you go.

53
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:53,247
How come she's not waking up?

54
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,290
Lord Lee Rang, you drink it too.

55
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,043
You've been hurt badly!

56
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:01,171
-I don't need it.
-Please just drink. Damn it!

57
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,549
You must live for Mrs. Boss to live.

58
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:06,844
Koo Shin-ju and I risked our lives
to save you.

59
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,304
So, damn it! Just drink it!

60
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:29,533
My goodness.

61
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,620
Please.

62
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,206
Please wake up.

63
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:47,217
So this one is on our side?

64
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:52,014
-Must I repeat myself, darn it?
-What? So Nyudo was actually the fox?

65
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,725
Yes, I'm Nyudo.

66
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:59,479
Hong-joo, Moo-yeong.
Please hang in there a little longer.

67
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:01,023
It's three against one. Just give up.

68
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,734
She's quite strong.

69
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,738
Bring it!

70
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,292
Ice.

71
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,211
I got you.

72
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,465
I hate you.

73
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:29,801
I'll especially freeze up
the insides of your lungs too.

74
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:48,278
I found it!

75
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:06,004
How dare you hurt Yuki!

76
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,633
That prick. How did he unfreeze my ice?

77
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:15,389
-Have your skills gone stale?
-There's no way.

78
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,216
No, don't!

79
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:57,264
It's gonna take some time. My body
is pretty battered from the poison.

80
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,522
Damn.

81
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:19,745
So that guy controls fire?
Gosh, I want that skill too.

82
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:23,957
That's why my skills didn't work.
Nyudo! Switch bodies with him!

83
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,376
Darn it.

84
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,380
Before I do,
let's destroy this body first!

85
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,175
Damn, it's such a waste.

86
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,387
Damn it!

87
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,686
Hurry. Hurry and melt!

88
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,232
No, no!

89
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,450
Now's the time!

90
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,478
Darn, prick. How dare you!

91
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,064
I'm back in my own body.

92
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:34,569
Oogama, I'll try again. Hold him tight!

93
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:40,117
Please move!

94
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,996
Yeon!

95
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,848
Oh, no. Nyudo-- Nyudo is--

96
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,105
Let go!

97
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,654
-Moo-yeong.
-I'm fine.

98
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:56,735
-Are you awake?
-I'm not dead, right?

99
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:59,988
It was close, but you're still alive.

100
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,993
Did you get hurt because of me?

101
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,954
-You're a mess.
-I'm fine.

102
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,584
You're awake, so nothing else matters.

103
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:20,300
I was so scared

104
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,178
that I'd never get to see you again.

105
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:27,015
I promised to follow you to the afterlife.

106
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:30,477
I love you.

107
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,235
What?

108
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:41,321
I love you, Rang.

109
00:13:58,088 --> 00:13:59,089
Goodness.

110
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,592
Gosh, the three of us are a complete mess.

111
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:08,890
But still, we won.

112
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,674
We're back at the hotel.

113
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,555
It truly was one hell of a night.

114
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:52,851
Gosh. Let's go to Myoyeongak
and treat our wounds first.

115
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:57,564
Hold on. I need to check on Rang first.

116
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,527
Oh, my-- My goodness.

117
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,741
All the Yachas are gone.

118
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:12,829
Gosh, that punk.
I knew he'd take care of it.

119
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:25,759
What's for lunch today?

120
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,436
-Madame, there's a reservation call.
-We're not taking guests this week.

121
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,023
-Say your boss was stabbed.
-It's a group reservation, ma'am.

122
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,068
A group reservation? How many?

123
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:48,531
A group? I should take them in then.

124
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:50,784
Is that prick Cheon Moo-yeong here?

125
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,663
Oh, my. He had his reasons.

126
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:57,290
Reasons, my foot.
We almost died because of him.

127
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,167
I'll take care of it.

128
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:01,795
Don't let him go alive.

129
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,255
-I won't let it slide.
-Okay.

130
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:09,177
-Gosh, who the hell is it?
-Who?

131
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,346
The one who killed all the Yachas at once.

132
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,808
There was another one of them.
It was probably him.

133
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:16,810
The Shinigami Mercenaries' boss.

134
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:25,151
-Hey, you're bleeding!
-Oh, gosh. I hope it's not infected.

135
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,907
-Rang.
-Yeah?

136
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:35,704
Why don't you have a shadow?

137
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:38,790
What do you mean?

138
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:44,587
The sunlight is this bright, yet…

139
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:50,969
Guys!

140
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,763
You scared me. Why?

141
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:56,683
Do you guys happen to remember
how we got back to Myoyeongak?

142
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,227
-What are you suddenly on about?
-Tell me!

143
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,897
After fighting all night,
we got back to Room 404, and…

144
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,237
-Huh? How did we get here?
-Why don't we remember anything?

145
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,573
Wait. Be quiet.

146
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,372
-Can you hear that?
-This music.

147
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,505
Wh-- What's that doing in my room?

148
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:31,134
-This isn't Myoyeongak.
-What?

149
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:33,803
We are…

150
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,265
still in Room 404.

151
00:17:58,578 --> 00:17:59,579
Oh, shit.

152
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:09,547
-Gosh.
-Who are you?

153
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:18,973
The Hypnotism Society.

154
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:22,519
Please, let's talk instead!
I'm the only son in the family line.

155
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:29,234
I'm the boss of the Shinigami Mercenaries.

156
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:32,529
The name is Satori.

157
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:40,328
From now on,
you can't take one step out of this room.

158
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:43,164
Until you die.

159
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,597
-You can try.
-Oh, before that…

160
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:03,268
give me your treasures.

161
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,730
You crazy prick, you make me laugh.

162
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:12,318
One, two, three.

163
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,869
-Yeon!
-Have you lost your mind?

164
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,162
Don't be surprised.

165
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,792
Because this one was charmed
from the very beginning.

166
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:32,547
One, two, three.

167
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,969
Gosh, what's the rush?

168
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:45,894
-Yeon.
-What the--

169
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:51,900
-What did I just do?
-I woke you to show you something special.

170
00:19:54,944 --> 00:20:00,408
You see, I wish you'd strangle each other.

171
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,120
One, two, three.

172
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,425
Moo-yeong, don't do it!

173
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:18,760
Hong-joo!

174
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:22,013
No, don't! Let go!

175
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:25,892
It's no use, because I charmed them too.

176
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,143
One, two, three.

177
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:28,811
One, two, three.

178
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,815
Guys, please!

179
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:39,906
How do you feel now?

180
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:47,372
How disappointing.

181
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:57,048
You killed two of us with these skills?

182
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:58,383
That's enough.

183
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:03,596
Now that I've given you the treasures,
please just stop.

184
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:08,851
How great.
The mountain god of Joseon is pleading.

185
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,062
But that's too bad.

186
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:16,734
Not a single being has ever
left my battlefield alive.

187
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,203
-Please stop.
-Are you surrendering?

188
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:29,622
No.

189
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:31,874
Hooray.

190
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,793
What are you trying to say?

191
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:37,797
I said, "Hooray."

192
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,426
Hooray.

193
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:47,098
You crazy fool-- What's this?
What are you doing?

194
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:51,269
Ice.

195
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,062
What the hell are you--

196
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:07,493
You may not know it,
but a nine-tailed fox has similar skills.

197
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,167
From now on, you guys…

198
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:17,920
When I say "hooray" thrice,
the guy before me is the enemy.

199
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:22,925
Don't ask, don't argue.
Just finish him off.

200
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,197
-Moo-yeong.
-Hong-joo.

201
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:51,287
Don't ever slight
a mountain god of Joseon again, kid.

202
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:54,082
Throw him off the roof.

203
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:01,631
Oh, geez.

204
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,300
You okay?

205
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:14,435
-Hey, you guys just jump off with him.
-Yes, sir.

206
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:23,611
What? Cheon Moo-yeong!

207
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:36,165
Hey!

208
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:41,087
Damn it.

209
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:53,349
D-2 DAYS

210
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:18,749
People died at the Bando Hotel?

211
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:24,922
-What bastard would dare that at my hotel?
-What about Ginko's wedding?

212
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:29,093
Honey, how can we hold a wedding
where people died?

213
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:30,511
-Goodness.
-Oh, dear.

214
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:32,180
I'm fine with that.

215
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:38,686
All the more reason
to show that the Bando Hotel is thriving.

216
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:41,480
That we, the Tawaras, are unshakable.

217
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:43,482
Well said!

218
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:47,111
We just need to stop the reporters
and get rid of the bodies!

219
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,573
You're more like my daughter now.

220
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:02,418
My wedding will be attended by
the Governor-General's key figures,

221
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,004
and Joseon's most notorious
pro-Japanese groups.

222
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:07,715
Don't tell me
you're targeting your wedding?

223
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,345
I'll gather them all in one place,
and boom!

224
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:15,598
We blow them up.

225
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,670
I hear you tailor the best suits
in all of Gyeongseong.

226
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,214
We're closed.

227
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:52,635
Don't you know who I am?

228
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:56,555
My bride is a regular here, Ginko Tawara.

229
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:01,852
I've heard a lot about you, sir.

230
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:05,773
Our wedding is this Sunday,
so I'm here to get a suit fitted.

231
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:09,402
It's an honor, sir.

232
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,697
Isn't Ginko such a charming woman?

233
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:15,950
What do you like about her?

234
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:21,497
Her flame withstands all tramples,
just like any other Joseon girl.

235
00:26:22,707 --> 00:26:26,502
As the one doing the trampling,
it's extremely exhilarating, you know.

236
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,840
That's why I like Joseon.

237
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:36,178
Smile a little.

238
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:43,060
I said, smile.

239
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:49,984
Fourth Branch of Gyeongseong's
Independence Volunteer Corps, no?

240
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:56,032
Most of the war chest funds
going to Manchuria moves through you.

241
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,077
Why are you so surprised?

242
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:03,622
As of today,
the first three branches don't exist.

243
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:07,043
All its members were shot dead.

244
00:27:16,761 --> 00:27:17,845
But…

245
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,639
why do you think this place still stands?

246
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:28,522
-If you want to kill me, just do it.
-Well.

247
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:33,027
That's no fun, is it?

248
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:37,031
Tell this to my bride.

249
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:42,203
Don't even think of having hope.

250
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:45,915
And that I know everything.

251
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:54,006
I'm counting on you for my suit,
Water Snail Bride.

252
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:17,738
-Geez! That movie sucked, huh?
-Yeah.

253
00:28:18,948 --> 00:28:23,119
Still, it's been ages since we did this.
Has it been 300 years?

254
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:24,370
-Honey.
-Yeah?

255
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,956
Can you get me some bingsu or whatever?

256
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,457
-Bingsu?
-Yeah.

257
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:30,584
Okay, I'll be right back.

258
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:58,863
I must go to my brother.

259
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,620
Moo-yeong! Hey, Moo-yeong!

260
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:10,624
Wake up, Moo-yeong!

261
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:15,004
I gather you're the one
who had Cheon Moo-yeong's back, sir?

262
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,840
Well, I wouldn't say I had his back.

263
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:24,013
No political statements please.
All I did was pure business.

264
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,765
-Business, indeed.
-Shut up, sir!

265
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,021
Shut-- Shame on you.
You shut that mouth of yours!

266
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:35,316
Seniority exists, even in the afterlife.

267
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:40,404
Well. I guess I'll just go tell
the King of the Dead.

268
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,323
Don't tell on me!

269
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:47,161
My intentions were pure, okay?

270
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:53,209
-Pure?
-The world is in shambles these days.

271
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:56,128
It teems with the innocent dead, no?

272
00:29:56,212 --> 00:30:02,092
It's already in shambles.
Is it so bad to turn it upside down?

273
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:07,264
Turn the world upside down?

274
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:15,564
What is the reason
Moo-yeong came to this era?

275
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:19,109
Don't you have an idea?

276
00:30:21,362 --> 00:30:26,534
He is dead. I saw it with my own eyes.

277
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:37,127
Who is he?

278
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:42,049
I raised him as my own.
Please take good care of him.

279
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:44,093
He's injured all over.

280
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:47,763
I'm not sure if he's going to make it.

281
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:51,392
Even so, he's a descendant
of the Siberian tigers.

282
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:54,311
I'm sure he'll wake up.

283
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,482
What did the Chief Commissioner say?

284
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:00,818
He came to warn you.

285
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:04,154
-That he knows everything.
-And the bombs?

286
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:10,369
I didn't get caught, but I'm anxious.
Wouldn't it be better to change our plans?

287
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:14,164
No, this is our only chance.
We must push ahead.

288
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:16,709
The organization has fallen.
You can't do it alone.

289
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,545
Isn't there one left?

290
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:23,299
The perfect reinforcement for the job.

291
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,759
Your life sure is dynamic.

292
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:29,555
You're here for less than a month,
and you survived death how many times?

293
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,311
Excuse me.

294
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:39,940
You're getting married?
Do you even know what he is?

295
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:42,318
I know that he's not human.

296
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:45,946
-If you know, then why?
-I'll set off a bomb at my wedding.

297
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:49,783
-Then what about you?
-I was ready since I entered the corps.

298
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:52,703
Why do all women who look like this
go big or go home?

299
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:55,080
Let's say you sacrifice your life.

300
00:31:55,164 --> 00:31:58,834
-But will it kill a demon of that caliber?
-That's why I need you, Koo Shin-ju.

301
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,837
-When is the wedding?
-This Sunday at 6:00 p.m.

302
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,632
Who the hell gets married at night?

303
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:08,636
The Governor will attend
after his Gyeonggi inspection tour.

304
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,555
Wait, if it's Sunday…

305
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:14,642
It's in two days.
The day of the lunar eclipse.

306
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:16,185
A lunar eclipse?

307
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:18,771
I'm sorry, Eun-ho,
but I can't go on that day.

308
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:20,689
I'll go.

309
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,986
-Lord Lee Yeon!
-I don't know about anything else,

310
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:29,490
but we're a nation that never fails
to attend celebratory events, no?

311
00:32:30,074 --> 00:32:33,744
I heard you were against Shin-ju
being an independence activist. So why?

312
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:37,581
Because I have some debt to settle
with your soon-to-be husband.

313
00:32:37,665 --> 00:32:38,749
That wedding.

314
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:42,544
I'll make it the funeral of the century.

315
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:54,223
The Shinigami Mercenaries lost
to the nine-tailed fox?

316
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,518
-And the treasures?
-They've lost them.

317
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:02,356
I send five of the greatest talents,

318
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:05,025
but I get neither the fox's neck
nor the treasures?

319
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:08,237
-I wonder why that is.
-The mercenaries were being sloppy.

320
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,407
That damn mentality
is why we got played by that fox!

321
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:18,872
-He's a master of schemes.
-No, this has nothing to do with that.

322
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:25,254
The moment he sent Madame Ryu here
to lure the mercenaries to the hotel,

323
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:27,631
he was painting a picture.

324
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:30,259
One that would rattle the tables.

325
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:32,678
You're overestimating the enemy, sir.

326
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:38,225
When you're at war,
the one who respects the opponent wins.

327
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:43,564
If I were the nine-tailed fox,

328
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:49,069
how would I counterattack?

329
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:56,368
Now we rattle them from our side too.

330
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:11,300
Hey! My foot's asleep.

331
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:13,969
Be a bit patient!

332
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:17,014
I thought we were ambushing a wedding.

333
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:19,433
Why make dumplings?
Are we fighting with them?

334
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:21,435
I won't be here after two days.

335
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:24,313
That's what I'm saying.
Why waste your time on this?

336
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,482
Your body's still a mess too.

337
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:29,735
Hey, it looks like I'll be fighting
until the moment I leave.

338
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:33,155
Can't I just make some dumplings
with my only brother for today?

339
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:39,536
Gosh, what kind of person
says their good-byes with dumplings?

340
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:43,874
It'll only make us sad,
if it's too extravagant a farewell.

341
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,586
Even if I'm not here,

342
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:51,256
just think I went on a trip
after making some dumplings.

343
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,720
I'll live just fine without you.

344
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:01,475
Now that I've spent a month with you,
I'm already sick of you.

345
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:04,561
Always creating trouble,
getting hurt, and tricking me.

346
00:35:04,645 --> 00:35:08,982
Gosh, I don't like you either.
You're a picky eater and you talk back.

347
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:13,028
Not once have I ever seen you
come home by your curfew, geez.

348
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,822
You're an awfully restless sleeper.

349
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:16,198
-Picky eater!
-Opium addict!

350
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:22,996
Yes, that's how you do it.

351
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,168
If you miss me by any chance,

352
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:31,588
just remember the ugly things, like now.

353
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:33,799
I'll do that too.

354
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:45,227
Let's make a promise. To never cry.

355
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:49,022
Send me off with a smile until the end.

356
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:55,612
I promise.

357
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:59,324
-Hurry up.
-No, I don't want to!

358
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:01,702
-You must wash it to heal faster.
-But it--

359
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:03,871
-Hey, just sit!
-But it's going to sting!

360
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:06,415
-You're the one to talk!
-Take off-- That's cold!

361
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:10,836
-Hey, hey!
-You do it then!

362
00:36:12,296 --> 00:36:15,465
He's over a thousand years old
but he's playing so heartily.

363
00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:19,219
This is the first time
I've seen Boss smile like that.

364
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:25,058
Will they never see each other
after tomorrow?

365
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:30,147
Yeah.

366
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:32,190
Never.

367
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:38,447
-I don't want to!
-Hey, damn it! Hey!

368
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:48,749
That's still on your arm?

369
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:52,878
Oh, this? You're right.

370
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:56,965
But because of your pure nature,
you will lose your way.

371
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:02,763
She hopes this will help you
find your way.

372
00:37:03,347 --> 00:37:06,683
Since the fortune god gifted me this,
I guess it must be something good.

373
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:10,771
Give me my present you call a cell phone.
You said you'd give it after a month.

374
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:13,148
Damn, you haven't forgotten.

375
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:21,865
Here. You can have it,
but you can't use it here anyway.

376
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:25,410
-No battery, no cell tower.
-You scammed me again?

377
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,331
So I've prepared something else.

378
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:31,750
Ta-da!

379
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:35,629
-A golden ax?
-What do you think? So cool, huh?

380
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:40,467
If you pull them out during fights
you'll look super rich and trendy!

381
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:43,428
-You idiot, you know how weak gold is?
-It's gold-plated.

382
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:47,933
Geez. My goodness.

383
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:57,526
Up until a month ago,
I thought to kill you if I ever met you.

384
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:05,450
Well, the world tends to stab you
in the back like that.

385
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:09,579
A diner will suddenly change its name
once you're done saving its coupons.

386
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:13,125
Stock information from a friend
will always tank.

387
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:14,918
What are you on about?

388
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:19,881
The world may stab you in the back.

389
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:24,928
But by having the right person by you,
either a lover or a family member,

390
00:38:25,012 --> 00:38:26,221
you will never fall.

391
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:29,099
I'm saying, live a good life.

392
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:33,562
Even if I'm not here, live briskly.
With your Little Mermaid.

393
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,484
Whatever. I'm going to sleep.

394
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,641
You're okay.

395
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:15,187
You'll get better, ma'am.

396
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,423
-When did you wake up?
-Just now.

397
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:51,598
How can you be smiling?
You were on the brink of death, Madame!

398
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:55,018
But it all just feels fruitless.

399
00:39:57,187 --> 00:40:00,065
-I lost the treasure.
-Does that even matter right now?

400
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,692
Why put yourself in harm's way?

401
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:10,075
I won't die so easily.
How could I die with you holding on to me?

402
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,329
Promise me that you won't get hurt again.

403
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:18,708
Let me get hurt instead,
since I'm okay with dying!

404
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:20,001
Why would you die, brat?

405
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:22,379
You're mine.

406
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,055
Don't cry.

407
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:38,311
After Yeon leaves,
let's take the girls to the hot springs.

408
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,193
Apricot.

409
00:40:47,571 --> 00:40:49,072
They have something to say to you.

410
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:52,701
You go first.

411
00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:55,412
No, you first.

412
00:40:55,912 --> 00:41:02,377
About trying to kill that girl
at the hotel, and pushing you and stuff.

413
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:08,258
-Sorry about that.
-And thanks for not telling Mr. Lee Rang.

414
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:11,261
They said they did it
because they were so scared.

415
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:19,227
Life isn't so easy, huh?

416
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,689
Seeing all that,
working for a non-human Madame.

417
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:26,318
But the last thing I want
is for you to have blood on your hands.

418
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:30,405
It's the first time that's hard.
After that, it gets easier.

419
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:32,908
My brother said so.

420
00:41:38,038 --> 00:41:40,081
Apricot.

421
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,503
Is that Madame's medicine?
Here, we'll do it.

422
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:49,758
Thank you for everything, ma'am.

423
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,934
You seem full of stories but I won't pry.

424
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:02,729
Instead, can you sell something for me?

425
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:04,606
This boutique…

426
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:07,525
will be closing soon.

427
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:11,154
It seems to be doing well, so why?

428
00:42:11,238 --> 00:42:15,325
These are such times, no?

429
00:42:38,932 --> 00:42:42,852
By any chance, do you make deliveries too?

430
00:42:46,982 --> 00:42:47,983
What pretty shoes.

431
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:52,696
-Who's it from?
-I was told not to reveal the name.

432
00:42:53,947 --> 00:42:55,782
But they left a message.

433
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:59,452
"These shoes are expensive and pretty,

434
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:02,289
but they look like
they'll hurt your toes."

435
00:43:03,415 --> 00:43:07,002
The paths I took all my life
were all headed towards you.

436
00:43:08,295 --> 00:43:09,421
I tried…

437
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:15,468
running away,
in case my misfortune rubbed off on you.

438
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:18,888
But I couldn't get too far.

439
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:22,183
So, Hong-joo.

440
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:27,063
Wear these shoes,
and by the time you get a callus…

441
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:32,319
think of me a little too.

442
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,619
It's a perfect fit.

443
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:45,457
He didn't say where he was going?

444
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:47,584
No, Madame.

445
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:52,172
It's fine.

446
00:43:53,173 --> 00:43:57,302
He won't be able to get too far
from me anyway.

447
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:09,022
Delicious as always.

448
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:15,403
Ta-da.

449
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:19,324
Pretty, huh? Moo-yeong bought them for me.

450
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:23,244
Looks like the watermelons
from Mt. Mudeung.

451
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:24,329
Wanna fight?

452
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:26,873
I'm leaving tomorrow.

453
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:32,921
What if you miss the lunar eclipse?
You can never go, right?

454
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:36,257
Should I just smash the moon into two?

455
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:40,261
I'll go, even if the sky falls. I must.

456
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:47,060
You're looking calmer than I imagined.
After losing the ruler to Moo-yeong.

457
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:53,274
Right. You can still go home
as long as you have the stone.

458
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:57,112
Before I go, I'll get the Governor's head.

459
00:44:58,321 --> 00:44:59,447
The Chief Commissioner?

460
00:45:00,407 --> 00:45:01,408
Let's do it together.

461
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:06,246
I'm the only one who belongs in this era.

462
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:10,500
You were high on opium,
and Moo-yeong was turned to stone.

463
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:13,962
You think I haven't fought back?

464
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:21,719
I'm sure you did.
Alone, with all your might.

465
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:24,139
No matter how hard I tried,

466
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:27,559
they hunted anything,
whether animal or human.

467
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:30,061
Their blood forming rivers
in all of Joseon.

468
00:45:32,272 --> 00:45:33,398
But nothing changed.

469
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:43,533
Hong-joo, I know the future.
And what happens to Joseon.

470
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:48,663
I'm dying to know, but don't spoil it.

471
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:51,583
I hate foul play.

472
00:45:54,294 --> 00:45:57,755
Well, it's not like what I do
will make a big difference to the future.

473
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:04,929
But still,
I'll do what I can in my place right now.

474
00:46:06,723 --> 00:46:08,475
As the last mountain god of Joseon.

475
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,478
I'd love be swayed to join you.

476
00:46:13,313 --> 00:46:17,025
But you are bound to leave,
while I'm the one who'll be left behind.

477
00:46:19,736 --> 00:46:20,904
Leave me out of it.

478
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:30,830
D-1 DAY

479
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:38,922
-You okay? Let me see.
-Gosh, seriously. What are they doing now?

480
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:45,720
Oh, my. Who is this handsome guy?

481
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:50,058
Remember that a man is defined by
his hair, fashion, and eyebrows.

482
00:46:50,934 --> 00:46:54,103
You're such a stylish man
since you're from the future, huh?

483
00:46:56,189 --> 00:46:59,901
But who will trim my brows once you leave?

484
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:03,947
I promise to look for you
in that era, Mi-yeon.

485
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,365
After all, we're friends.

486
00:47:06,658 --> 00:47:07,700
Geez.

487
00:47:08,952 --> 00:47:12,205
-Gosh, I'm gonna--
-Hey, Mr. Jindo!

488
00:47:13,915 --> 00:47:16,876
-Where are you going?
-To get some seolleongtang for Madame.

489
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:20,797
Have some sikhye first.

490
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:23,716
Thank you.

491
00:47:25,677 --> 00:47:27,178
You like Madame Ryu, huh?

492
00:47:30,223 --> 00:47:31,349
Am I wrong?

493
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:34,936
No wonder. I heard him wailing
in her room this morning.

494
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,897
Well, that's not-- You heard wrong!

495
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:40,567
I clearly heard it with my own ears too.

496
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:42,527
Gosh, that's not what happened!

497
00:47:56,708 --> 00:47:57,709
Ho-yeong.

498
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:07,760
And the treasures?

499
00:48:11,598 --> 00:48:13,850
That's the first thing you ask?
How disappointing.

500
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,565
Were you hurt badly?

501
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:25,945
It's no big deal.

502
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:36,873
But I could only get this one.

503
00:48:36,956 --> 00:48:41,753
When my body's fully recovered,
I'll get the guardian stone from Lee Yeon.

504
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:43,838
-When is Lee Yeon leaving?
-Tomorrow.

505
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,049
We don't have time. Let's do it now.

506
00:48:46,758 --> 00:48:47,759
Right now?

507
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:51,471
With just the golden ruler?
What if it fails?

508
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:55,183
It's not your fault, but only my fate.

509
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:07,362
Ho-yeong, answer me one question.

510
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,198
What will you do first,
when you're revived?

511
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:13,117
What about you?
What did you come all the way here for?

512
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:15,036
My dream…

513
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,121
is to…

514
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:22,835
live a normal life with you.

515
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:28,883
In a normal house, driving a normal car.

516
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:32,387
Wondering what to eat
for lunch tomorrow with you.

517
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:38,768
We'll go to the bathhouse on weekends.

518
00:49:40,103 --> 00:49:41,104
Seriously.

519
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:46,275
Like a very, very normal…

520
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:48,820
Like any other family.

521
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:55,326
So, Ho-yeong.

522
00:49:58,162 --> 00:49:59,664
Please come back to me.

523
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:06,754
So you lost the golden ruler?

524
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:13,678
Just tell me honestly. What is all this?

525
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:16,013
I'm thinking
nothing was ever a coincidence.

526
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:19,559
My coming to this era
to retrieve this stone,

527
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,271
and the ruler falling into my hands.

528
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:49,255
What's this? He doesn't have a face.

529
00:50:50,298 --> 00:50:55,553
In the beginning,
there was only one mountain god, not four.

530
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:00,183
The original mountain god?

531
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:06,856
But I heard he lost it,
so demons began to be born on this land.

532
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:08,399
The King of the Dead killed him.

533
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:15,406
After which, the king divided
the original's power into four gems.

534
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:19,911
Sealing them all in different eras.
The stone and the ruler being one of them.

535
00:51:22,455 --> 00:51:26,375
That's why the guardian stone was
in the future, where I came from,

536
00:51:26,876 --> 00:51:28,586
and why the golden ruler was here.

537
00:51:30,213 --> 00:51:33,925
Those two should not exist
in the same era.

538
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:37,220
Because they attract each other
like magnets.

539
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:39,263
To become one, like it originally was.

540
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:43,601
I'll take the stone back to the future.
So what's the worry?

541
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:45,812
The ruler Moo-yeong took.

542
00:51:45,895 --> 00:51:50,191
He's trying to awaken something
with the golden ruler.

543
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:52,735
I know, it's his older brother.

544
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:07,959
It's…

545
00:52:09,377 --> 00:52:10,378
not his brother?

546
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:14,882
If it's not him, then…

547
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,761
It can't be!

548
00:52:55,965 --> 00:52:58,342
REVIVE

549
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,383
No, Moo-yeong!

550
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:40,801
He can't wake that up!

551
00:53:46,015 --> 00:53:47,099
Then we must stop him.

552
00:53:47,183 --> 00:53:48,351
Why just observe?

553
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:52,313
Because he's just an empty vessel now.

554
00:53:53,064 --> 00:53:58,861
The only way to catch him
is to wake him up.

555
00:53:58,945 --> 00:54:01,489
Why make things so dangerous, huh?

556
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,372
Because it's my duty to protect this era.

557
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:12,083
Then what about Moo-yeong?
Who will protect him?

558
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:14,043
You seem to forget at times.

559
00:54:14,919 --> 00:54:19,882
But old hag, we're not your pawns.
We feel pain when we get hurt.

560
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:23,094
We feel hurt when a parental figure
like you abandons us.

561
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:24,845
That child you turned to stone!

562
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:31,852
He wants to live. Even if
he has to beg for time, he wants to live!

563
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:01,716
It's a gift.

564
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:07,179
Paper cranes?

565
00:55:13,978 --> 00:55:16,480
I folded all one hundred of them
thinking of you.

566
00:55:16,564 --> 00:55:18,524
Then your love comes true, they say.

567
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:23,946
Forever.

568
00:55:28,576 --> 00:55:30,244
I always seem to be receiving.

569
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:35,583
From you.

570
00:55:36,584 --> 00:55:37,710
And from Lee Yeon.

571
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:51,474
-One seolleongtang to go, please.
-Me too.

572
00:55:52,141 --> 00:55:54,727
Give us a bowl each, okay? He'll pay.

573
00:55:55,311 --> 00:55:57,271
-It's been a while, sir.
-Indeed.

574
00:55:57,772 --> 00:56:01,859
Did you guys follow me here?
But why should I pay?

575
00:56:03,611 --> 00:56:06,530
I have no money.
I got fired from my part-time job here.

576
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:11,952
I don't either. Boss banned robbery,
arson, and even pickpocketing.

577
00:56:16,499 --> 00:56:17,666
Oh, gosh.

578
00:56:31,097 --> 00:56:32,765
Jae-yoo, have a bowl too.

579
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:40,648
No, I have to get it to Madame Ryu.
She has to eat it warm.

580
00:56:43,818 --> 00:56:47,947
Geez, that damn Jindo.
He only thinks about his owner.

581
00:56:49,073 --> 00:56:50,407
A virtuous man indeed!

582
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:07,466
No, no, no.

583
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:21,355
You promised to come back.

584
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:25,526
You promised, but why?

585
00:57:32,825 --> 00:57:35,286
Why did you leave me behind?

586
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:40,583
I don't have anyone now.

587
00:57:43,502 --> 00:57:45,087
I only have you, Ho-yeong.

588
00:57:46,755 --> 00:57:51,719
No, no, no, no.

589
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:55,097
No!

590
00:57:58,434 --> 00:57:59,977
No, no, no.

591
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:03,189
Moo-yeong.

592
00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:17,620
Ho-yeong.

593
00:58:28,756 --> 00:58:30,007
You did it, brother.

594
00:58:32,885 --> 00:58:35,054
Ho-yeong, you did it.

595
00:58:38,057 --> 00:58:39,308
We did it, Ho-yeong.

596
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:42,811
Ho-yeong.

597
00:58:45,481 --> 00:58:46,690
You did it.

598
00:58:46,774 --> 00:58:49,276
Thank you for coming back.

599
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:54,156
Thank you for coming back alive, Ho-yeong.

600
00:59:12,591 --> 00:59:14,093
Don't die, Moo-yeong!

601
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:16,720
Not yet, no!

602
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:22,142
Gosh, Ho-yeong. I can't breathe.

603
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,479
-I'm not your brother.
-Huh?

604
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:38,617
Thanks for your hard work,
mountain god of the north.

605
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:42,037
Your role ends here.

606
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:55,134
Oh, goodness.

607
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:24,246
Can't muster your strength, can you?
It's because your heart stopped.

608
01:00:25,873 --> 01:00:29,251
What the hell have I awakened?

609
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:33,130
People called me
"the original mountain god."

610
01:00:34,882 --> 01:00:38,594
It is because of me
that your brother went batshit crazy.

611
01:00:38,677 --> 01:00:41,764
It was me who told you
how to save your brother too.

612
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:45,517
I had to find my scattered powers.

613
01:00:47,478 --> 01:00:51,523
Everything's turning dark, no?
It's the light of death.

614
01:00:53,901 --> 01:00:55,444
And it suits you better.

615
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:07,998
Is this the end for me?

616
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,877
In this deserted place…

617
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,547
with not one person to grieve for me…

618
01:01:16,924 --> 01:01:18,300
Dying here alone.

619
01:01:19,385 --> 01:01:20,677
Is that my ending?

620
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:23,347
I'm screwed.

621
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,267
Where did it all go wrong?

622
01:01:29,645 --> 01:01:31,605
What kind of person do you know me as?

623
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:34,274
You wanted to be a doctor
instead of a mountain god.

624
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,277
You cherished every single blade of grass.

625
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:39,696
You got back up when you got hurt.

626
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,909
But you cried your eyes out
when Yeon or I got hurt.

627
01:01:47,121 --> 01:01:48,580
We were young then.

628
01:01:49,957 --> 01:01:51,208
And I've changed.

629
01:01:52,793 --> 01:01:54,169
Ta-da.

630
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:58,048
But still, Hong-joo.

631
01:02:00,092 --> 01:02:03,720
There are things in the world
that don't change.

632
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:08,767
I miss you.

633
01:02:10,853 --> 01:02:12,938
If it means I'd see you one last time…

634
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:33,667
I want to live too.

635
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:48,724
Moo-yeong! Cheon Moo-yeong!

636
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:54,354
Hey, can you hear me?

637
01:02:54,897 --> 01:02:57,649
Wake up! Come on, Moo-yeong.

638
01:03:07,493 --> 01:03:09,328
Wake up, Cheon Moo-yeong.

639
01:03:11,872 --> 01:03:13,123
You have to fight me.

640
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:16,376
You didn't get revenge on me yet.

641
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:22,925
I wonder why Yeon looks like
he's about to cry?

642
01:03:28,514 --> 01:03:29,515
Moo-yeong.

643
01:03:31,433 --> 01:03:35,187
You're not going to die.
You can't die yet.

644
01:03:38,398 --> 01:03:40,943
So stop playing weak and get up,
you bastard!

645
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:50,494
You're giving me this, so what?

646
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:52,454
I have…

647
01:03:56,792 --> 01:03:58,043
wronged you so much.

648
01:03:58,126 --> 01:04:00,796
Don't apologize. I won't accept it.

649
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:04,633
You think I'll forgive you
if you go like this?

650
01:04:04,716 --> 01:04:05,801
Don't be ridiculous!

651
01:04:06,385 --> 01:04:09,972
Please protect Hong-joo.

652
01:04:34,496 --> 01:04:35,497
Wake up.

653
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,041
Hey, wake up.

654
01:04:40,919 --> 01:04:42,004
Don't die.

655
01:04:43,755 --> 01:04:45,173
Please don't die, Moo-yeong.

656
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:51,096
Don't die!

657
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,974
-Perhaps…
-Moo-yeong.

658
01:04:54,641 --> 01:04:56,268
…they were always there.

659
01:04:58,103 --> 01:04:59,104
My family.

660
01:05:00,939 --> 01:05:02,316
My real brother.

661
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:11,158
Selling Park's powder!
Pretty norigaes too!

662
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:13,744
Selling Park's powder!

663
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:16,038
-Hold this real quick.
-Where are you going?

664
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:17,664
I'll be right back.

665
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:45,108
This one and…

666
01:05:45,901 --> 01:05:51,198
Well, a man's going some place far.
Which one's the sturdiest?

667
01:05:58,580 --> 01:05:59,956
Rang.

668
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:02,125
Rang!

669
01:06:11,635 --> 01:06:12,636
Who are you?

670
01:06:20,394 --> 01:06:23,438
Hello, tasty and nutritious mermaid lady.

671
01:06:56,805 --> 01:06:57,806
Moo-yeong!

672
01:07:39,306 --> 01:07:40,390
No.

673
01:07:54,112 --> 01:07:55,197
Jae-yoo!

674
01:07:57,449 --> 01:07:58,450
Jae-yoo?

675
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:08,043
The blood amount tells me it wasn't fatal.

676
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,171
-She was taken alive.
-Who did this?

677
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:25,435
The mercenaries are still alive.

678
01:08:44,788 --> 01:08:46,873
-Rang.
-It's all my fault.

679
01:08:47,666 --> 01:08:53,129
I shouldn't have left her alone.
I left her there.

680
01:08:55,090 --> 01:08:58,260
-Let go. You'll get hurt.
-Aren't I pathetic?

681
01:08:59,094 --> 01:09:00,679
I can't even protect anyone.

682
01:09:02,848 --> 01:09:05,392
I'm neither human nor a fox,
but just a half-breed.

683
01:09:07,811 --> 01:09:09,396
Why was I born like this?

684
01:09:10,897 --> 01:09:13,567
-Rang, that's enough.
-Just go.

685
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:17,195
-You leave in a few hours anyway.
-How could I leave you like this?

686
01:09:18,113 --> 01:09:19,364
Don't worry and just go…

687
01:09:20,574 --> 01:09:22,242
to your home where the human is waiting.

688
01:09:23,243 --> 01:09:27,747
I was never one of your options
from the start.

689
01:09:28,999 --> 01:09:31,209
You know how many sword-cuts
I have right now?

690
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:33,712
I got cut so much,
it doesn't even hurt now!

691
01:09:33,795 --> 01:09:34,796
But--

692
01:09:35,755 --> 01:09:38,341
Even a splinter in your finger
breaks my heart.

693
01:09:38,425 --> 01:09:41,678
When I think about leaving you,
I feel like I might lose my mind.

694
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:48,268
Yeo-hee's not here.

695
01:09:50,478 --> 01:09:53,523
But if you leave too, I'm…

696
01:09:58,028 --> 01:10:00,947
I promise I won't leave you alone.

697
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:04,618
I promise.

698
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:09,247
Don't go.

699
01:10:09,998 --> 01:10:15,086
Please have my back, so I can fight.

700
01:10:17,923 --> 01:10:24,054
D-DAY 11:00 A.M.

701
01:10:29,517 --> 01:10:34,189
TALE OF THE NINE TAILED

702
01:10:57,545 --> 01:11:00,840
If you don't find the treasure today,
the hostages will die.

703
01:11:01,675 --> 01:11:03,551
He's starting a battle of wits.

704
01:11:03,635 --> 01:11:04,970
Our weakness is time.

705
01:11:05,053 --> 01:11:08,223
We must save them,
and catch the shits within the time limit.

706
01:11:09,099 --> 01:11:11,226
You're a weak one, huh?

707
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:13,269
Jae-yoo. Jae-yoo!

708
01:11:14,646 --> 01:11:18,066
Will you alone be able to change Joseon?

709
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:21,236
I'm sort of setting an example.
That I will fight to the end.

710
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:24,030
Believe in yourself,
just like I believe in you.

711
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:27,450
You are not the owners of this land.

712
01:11:28,576 --> 01:11:31,579
