1
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:56,974
TALE OF THE NINE TAILED

2
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,192
EPISODE 4

3
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:07,735
Why won't Rang get up?

4
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:10,112
Is he really sick?
He went through nothing, no?

5
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:11,989
As far as I can tell, he's awake.

6
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,824
He's just too ashamed to get up.

7
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:16,327
So, he's pretending to be asleep?

8
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,538
I'll get some ice water.

9
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:21,290
-All right.
-That looks heavy.

10
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:23,083
-It's fine.
-Oh, dear.

11
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:24,710
Thanks for your help. Go on.

12
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:32,843
Hey, wake up. Hurry, come on!

13
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:35,221
Get up.

14
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:37,097
Gosh, I even practiced lines for you.

15
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:38,766
-How about a rehearsal?
-Shall we?

16
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:42,186
What? She's a mermaid?

17
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:46,982
How dare you bring seafood
into our lineage of nine-tailed foxes!

18
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:50,820
There you go again.
You always talk about lineage.

19
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:54,114
Always on about becoming a mountain god,
building a family legacy!

20
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:56,367
How dare you!
You know I went through hell raising you!

21
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,118
You bastard!

22
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:01,288
-How dare you rebel against me?
-B-- Brother.

23
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:04,124
Can't you just let me be in love?

24
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,378
You brat. After all I've done for you!

25
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,463
Geez! Both of you, get lost!

26
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:11,048
-Get lost!
-Okay, okay.

27
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,008
Bye.

28
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:18,806
You're awake.

29
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:24,728
As you can see, I'm fine.

30
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,901
You still have a slight fever.

31
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:34,405
Don't touch me.

32
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:37,741
Why did you jump into the well?

33
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,535
Because you were dying.

34
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,538
I have unnecessary debt.

35
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:45,249
This is when you say thank you.

36
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,877
A fox must repay kindness,
regardless of its will.

37
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,962
Especially, when its life has been saved.

38
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:52,423
What do you want?

39
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,133
Well, I…

40
00:02:57,887 --> 00:02:59,722
I want to fall in love.

41
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,767
That came out naturally enough.

42
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:05,895
Being a half-bood,

43
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:09,189
I was always rejected
by both humans and demons.

44
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,816
But that ends now.

45
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:13,444
Finally, I can find true love.

46
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,988
-Not in your right mind, huh?
-It didn't work?

47
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:18,824
-Do I look like a matchmaker?
-He didn't even get my point.

48
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:22,703
Just tell me who you want killed.
I can easily blow up a village.

49
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:23,954
That's all right.

50
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:28,250
Then, can you grant me a wish?

51
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,544
-A wish?
-Little ones.

52
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,796
Maybe about seven of them?

53
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,431
Are you crying?

54
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:45,976
I was tossed into the year 1938
and worked my ass off.

55
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:50,773
But for the first time,
I'm actually glad I came here.

56
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,067
I get to see a new side of Lord Lee Rang.

57
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:56,528
You're right.

58
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:00,908
I always hoped for Rang
to go on normal dates,

59
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,077
to build a family,

60
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,455
and to live a normal life.

61
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:10,417
The problem is that
he's never dated anyone.

62
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:13,087
Hell, he's a virgin
who's never held a woman's hand.

63
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:15,798
-Do you have a plan?
-Well, first of all,

64
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,967
we check their compatibility
with their names.

65
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,345
-Gosh, but it's all wrong.
-This is science.

66
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,055
My wife and I got 99 points.

67
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,140
Hey, but Ji-ah and I only scored 25.

68
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:29,311
Geez. This couple only scores 23 points!

69
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:30,604
See?

70
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:33,065
Gosh.

71
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,443
I miss Ji-ah too.

72
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:39,655
Are you worried?
Hyunuiong's probably kept her protected.

73
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:42,616
Before I came here,
the forecast said it's monsoon season.

74
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:48,622
My Ji-ah always loses her umbrella.

75
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,419
I hope she's not getting rained on.

76
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,212
Cuckoo.

77
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:58,716
-Cuckoo.
-There's a cuckoo here?

78
00:04:58,799 --> 00:04:59,800
It's a cuckoo I know.

79
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:00,884
Cuckoo.

80
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,223
Cuckoo. Cuckoo.

81
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,350
-What are you doing up there?
-Oh, my…

82
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,895
Hello, my boss's brother.

83
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,856
Must you leave the front gate hanging?

84
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:17,818
"Bandits don't use the front gate!"

85
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,279
-That's what boss said--
-Just come down already.

86
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,366
So, did you look into it?

87
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:29,204
Here's the thing.
I handed this out to all my guys.

88
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:30,414
And?

89
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,626
There's this cultural mansion
behind Joseon Bank.

90
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,422
It's owned by a man named Park Ga,
who's made a fortune from gold mining.

91
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,721
Red-white mask robbed him?

92
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,098
Heard of Gyeongseong's
seven gold mining royalty?

93
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:53,103
He only targets them
and has robbed six of them already.

94
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,522
What did he steal?

95
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,316
That's what I find strange.

96
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,944
Cash, gold, and property deeds.
All were left behind,

97
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,279
except the jewelry box.

98
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:04,656
The jewelry box?

99
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,210
It's not here either.

100
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,090
Sis!

101
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,304
Oh, my!

102
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,389
-It's gold.
-Gold.

103
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:30,641
It's gold!

104
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,935
It's gold! It's gold!

105
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:35,604
It's gold!

106
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:47,699
This is Sunwoo Chan's house,
also known as the "King of Gold."

107
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,620
-And the owner?
-On a business trip to Gyeonggi-do.

108
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,997
Only his wife and daughter are home.

109
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:57,334
That's good.
Go in and steal the jewelry box.

110
00:06:58,127 --> 00:07:01,880
Me? Come on.
I've never stolen anything in my life.

111
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:06,718
Then, shall I do it?
A former mountain god?

112
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:10,347
Let's say I go in there
and steal the jewelry box.

113
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,099
You think that makes any sense?

114
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:16,395
But I don't want to.
Let's just stake out and catch the guy.

115
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,565
We'll catch him and keep the goods.
Now hurry and go.

116
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:22,401
Stop mentioning your former post
when you're at a disadvantage.

117
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,918
Nobody's looking. Just walk straight.
Why that little--

118
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:43,881
Wh-- What the?
Geez. He's watched too many movies.

119
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,876
Put both hands over your head.

120
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,711
Now turn around.

121
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,134
It's not what you think.

122
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,721
Honey! Yoo-ri!

123
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:35,098
You came here looking for me?

124
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:38,685
-Don't play any tricks.
-That hurts.

125
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:42,481
-I missed your violent nature.
-What does this look like to you?

126
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:46,318
Obviously, the beginning of our love.

127
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,154
When we first met, you were like--

128
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:52,324
You threatened me with a gun,
and even pecked me here.

129
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:56,662
Yoo-ri, give me a hug.

130
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,918
You're not the first to break in here.

131
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,503
You're the thirty-sixth.

132
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:06,421
You're not Yoo-ri?

133
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:08,215
My name is Sunwoo Eun-ho.

134
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:12,469
You should at least know the name
of the woman who put a hole in you.

135
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:14,554
Apologies, ma'am.

136
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,725
Apologies? For what?

137
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:22,854
I'm not doing this
because I want to either!

138
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,332
Ouch! This really--

139
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,213
Oh, my! W-- Wait!

140
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:03,145
How can he run like that
after getting shot?

141
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:19,995
Hong-joo, it's a flower that only blooms
in the boiling Fiery-Cauldron Hell.

142
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,372
Goodness.

143
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,458
I feel warm already.

144
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,128
You're the best, old man.

145
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,672
Gosh. If you like warm things so much,

146
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:33,383
why do you keep punishing
and tormenting yourself?

147
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,512
That's the only way I feel alive.

148
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:39,514
Do you still have trouble sleeping?

149
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,017
You dream about your siblings?

150
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,101
My siblings…

151
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,855
They wait for me, even in my dreams.

152
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:50,734
I put raw rice in the mouths
of my dead siblings, and incant this:

153
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,487
"I never abandoned you."

154
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,784
Even if I die soon,
I want to tell them that.

155
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:03,497
But I'm always too late.

156
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:11,755
Even we, who are called gods,
live grieving the loss of someone.

157
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,590
I, too, lost my son.

158
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:17,427
I was able to survive raising you guys.

159
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:21,181
Yeon, Moo-yeong, and you.

160
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:27,854
Old man, if Yeon and Moo-yeong fought,
whose side would you take?

161
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,191
I'm not sure.

162
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:33,068
It's a tough question.

163
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,529
I liked Yeon from the start.

164
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,489
But I can't abandon Moo-yeong again.

165
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,282
His bodily scars…

166
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,577
are all because of me.

167
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:48,708
They were good kids.

168
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,752
But why?

169
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,506
Both of them.

170
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:59,344
They're not the guys I used to know.

171
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,436
Hey, hurry up.

172
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:13,775
-A woman in there looks just like Yoo-ri.
-Right, the reporter. I saw her too.

173
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:16,361
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Who knew it'd be her house?

174
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:18,697
-And red-white mask?
-He's been following us.

175
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:41,344
You're strong.

176
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,105
Wow.

177
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:53,899
Great balance too.

178
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:18,548
But not so experienced
at hand-to-hand combat.

179
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,426
Shit.

180
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:24,971
Why? You have another talent?

181
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,143
Well, damn it.

182
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:39,903
Let me see my stalker's face.

183
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,038
A demon using an assassin weapon?

184
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:56,836
Rang!

185
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,975
You tried to kill me twice.

186
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,186
My brother and I plan to go all out today.

187
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,531
Get him!

188
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,117
There's no path there anyway!

189
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:33,123
Boss!

190
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:30,388
Who are you people?

191
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:32,182
With the gold he gave us,

192
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,643
I bought enough food
for the whole village.

193
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:37,520
-Good for you.
-They're human shields.

194
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:41,232
Who the hell is this prick?
Is the suspense really necessary?

195
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:44,986
-Let's take off all their masks.
-It's no use. He's already gone.

196
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,571
What about the item?

197
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:55,914
It's yeot.

198
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,169
I'll come for it soon, Lee Yeon.

199
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,054
And this.

200
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,234
This is a valuable original.

201
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,695
Even so, it's just jewelry.

202
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:31,199
-What is that bastard looking for?
-Hold on.

203
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,910
There's one last thing.

204
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:37,664
-Where are you pulling it out from?
-My goodness.

205
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,250
-Geez.
-Disgusting.

206
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:51,678
What is this?

207
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:55,890
-What? Is this really the golden ruler?
-Is it really?

208
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:57,434
GOLDEN RULER
TREASURE OF HYEOKGEOSE OF SILLA

209
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,270
-Is it something good?
-Haven't you heard about the legend?

210
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:03,732
"He who beholds the golden ruler will
revive the dead and make his name known."

211
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:05,859
The item revives the dead

212
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,153
when you measure
the length and width of a corpse.

213
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,071
Why would such a thing be here?

214
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:13,158
No one probably knew what it was used for.

215
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,784
There was a rumor before:

216
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,746
That the King of Silla's ruler was found
in a gold mine up north.

217
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,623
I thought it was just a rumor.

218
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,127
A treasure that revives the dead?

219
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,089
Just who is he trying to revive?

220
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,852
Long time no see.

221
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,729
Old hag.

222
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:46,149
Did I come too early?

223
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:49,736
I wanted to watch you run amok some more.

224
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:53,281
But it's been a while since I saw you,
so I thought I'd drop by.

225
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,866
How about a cup of tea?

226
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,244
Who exactly are you, old hag?

227
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:03,917
Being raised by you, and almost dying,
got me a bit confused.

228
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:09,422
Me? I'm a typical bureaucrat.

229
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:16,054
I raised you three out of necessity,
and removed you out of necessity.

230
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,764
I like how simple it is for you.

231
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,934
Puts me at ease to do just about anything.

232
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,228
I'm here to make you feel uneasy.

233
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:36,074
There's only one reason
I'm letting you be.

234
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,368
You need answers.

235
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,663
How did someone you turned
to stone come back to life?

236
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,958
Who dares shake the boundary
of the world of the Living and Dead?

237
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:50,505
Our Moo-yeong sure has changed.

238
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,509
You dare challenge me
with your eyes wide open too.

239
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:55,760
You're the one…

240
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,847
who abandoned me.

241
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,895
You're the one
who decided to play the villain,

242
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,565
so you shouldn't look so hurt.

243
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,191
Should you?

244
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:14,612
That's why…

245
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,617
you needed a mask, huh?

246
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:23,329
Why did you come to this era?

247
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:25,206
For what?

248
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,295
To bring my brother back,

249
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,799
and take back everything I lost
from you and Lee Yeon.

250
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:38,970
If you wish to do bad things…

251
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:41,973
eat well.

252
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:52,358
It seems you're not fully recovered yet.

253
00:19:57,989 --> 00:19:59,616
You'll regret this.

254
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:03,494
You'll regret not killing me today.

255
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:24,807
Oh, goodness.

256
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,978
I dug into Lee Yeon's whereabouts
as you requested.

257
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,272
There is a strange witness in Gunsan.

258
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:35,818
Is that so?

259
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,112
Okay.

260
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,963
-You did well.
-What if the old hag sees you?

261
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:56,631
We've already met.

262
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:58,216
Ta-da.

263
00:20:58,925 --> 00:20:59,926
Here. Have some tofu.

264
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:02,428
Gosh.

265
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:19,195
It still feels like a dream
that you're by my side.

266
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,408
Can I be honest?

267
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:26,202
I don't recognize you.

268
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,081
You seem like the Moo-yeong I know.

269
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:31,499
But I'm not so sure.

270
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,419
What kind of person do you know me as?

271
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,008
You wanted to be a doctor
instead of a mountain god.

272
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,927
You cherished every single blade of grass.

273
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,430
You got back up when you got hurt.

274
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:49,642
But you cried your eyes out
when Yeon or I got hurt.

275
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:52,687
What about now?

276
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,065
What am I like now?

277
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:59,610
I don't see you,
even when you're so close.

278
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:03,031
I don't recognize you anymore.

279
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:06,868
I shouldn't have become…

280
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:10,830
a mountain god.

281
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,168
I should've just stayed
by your side as Cheon Moo-yeong.

282
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,672
But your dreams eventually became mine.

283
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:22,091
-Do you intend to kill Yeon?
-What if I do?

284
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,720
Will you kill me?

285
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:34,103
You guys have already drawn me
into your dog fight.

286
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:39,984
You know better than anyone,
I'm not the type to sit back and watch.

287
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:13,267
What the hell?
You said it'll come back to life.

288
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:15,144
You call this the treasure of all time?

289
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:17,730
Maybe there's a manual.

290
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:20,566
The guardian stone is just a rock
if it leaves its place.

291
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,446
You're right.

292
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:27,949
This was how it all started.

293
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,993
The stone that creates a barrier,

294
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,038
and a treasure that awakens the dead.

295
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:35,623
What was he trying to do?

296
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:39,043
The golden ruler was never spotted
since the Japanese colonial era.

297
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:41,587
It disappeared from the world
after this period.

298
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:43,965
That's why he traveled through time.

299
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,594
Let's wait.

300
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:51,472
-What?
-He'll come back for it.

301
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,899
What's with the horse?

302
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:04,026
The mermaid asked for a ride.

303
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:06,154
Oh, my.

304
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:08,364
Aren't you going too fast
for a first date?

305
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:12,201
She'll hug him from behind and say,
"Baby, you're going too fast."

306
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:15,580
Don't worry.
The traffic laws can't stop my passion.

307
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:17,790
Goodness. Your chest is so hot.

308
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:19,167
Quit whispering!

309
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,545
I'll show you the bandit's passion.
Clip-clop, clip-clop.

310
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:26,632
-Should I kill him?
-Let's run!

311
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:58,748
Such a handsome horse. What's its name?

312
00:24:58,831 --> 00:24:59,999
Oh, it's Lee Yeon.

313
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:01,667
Your brother's name?

314
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,836
Because he's a tough one.

315
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:06,339
But why a horse?

316
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:11,344
Since my legs are actually a tail,
I can't walk or run for long.

317
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,512
It's always been my wish!

318
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:17,725
I've always wanted
to ride a horse through the fields.

319
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:20,937
If you want to enjoy speed,
why don't we ride a car?

320
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,773
No. It has to be a horse.

321
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,192
YEO-HEE'S IMAGINATION

322
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:28,778
Physical contact is essential
when riding horses.

323
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:32,490
The warmth you feel on your back
will make a man's heart flutter.

324
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:37,078
We will inevitably fall in love today.

325
00:25:38,246 --> 00:25:40,456
Put your center of gravity behind you.

326
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,209
-I told you to maintain your posture.
-Posture?

327
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:45,878
-Align your head, shoulders, and butt!
-Align--

328
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:48,923
Don't provoke it with strange noises.

329
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:50,424
Horses have sensitive ears.

330
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:55,554
Excuse me, but my legs hurt so much.
My thighs won't stay still.

331
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:58,140
Now, imagine this.

332
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:00,559
Say the enemy is coming
for your head right now.

333
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:02,186
Is this the time to talk?

334
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,814
Are we supposed to in battle?

335
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:12,822
Don't be scared. Use more force.

336
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:16,284
Put your center of gravity behind you.

337
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:33,634
Giddyap!

338
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,734
Wow, you're quite talented.

339
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,610
Really?

340
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:56,198
Do you want to join our bandit gang?
You'll make a good warrior.

341
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:57,742
A bandit gang…

342
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:06,000
How could I lose them? Geez.

343
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:10,254
Where on earth did they go to ride horses?

344
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:13,007
Do you intend to tail them
every time they go on dates?

345
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,300
I'm sure they'll be fine.

346
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:22,475
We should host their wedding
at a hotel, yeah?

347
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:26,520
-What about a small wedding?
-Nonsense. I want only what's best.

348
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:28,189
The venue, and everything else!

349
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:30,191
We'll cast the best singers too!

350
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:32,234
-Let me be the host!
-Sure, sure.

351
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:38,949
What's that?

352
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:43,704
Oh, dear.

353
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:47,416
-Baby!
-It's alive.

354
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,592
Who would abandon such an adorable baby?

355
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:59,428
This blanket is made of the finest silk.

356
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:01,055
So she's from a wealthy family.

357
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:04,100
I know! She's the child of a mistress.

358
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:07,019
Maybe she was abandoned
for being a girl, just like me.

359
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:09,105
Or the result of a Western-style love.

360
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:10,606
It's trendy these days.

361
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:15,528
Thank you for your opinions
I could care less about.

362
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:17,822
So what now? You girls gonna raise her?

363
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:21,617
This is the gisaeng's home.
We'll be in trouble if Madame finds out.

364
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:25,121
You heard her.
Put her back where we found her.

365
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:28,082
-No. She's a foundling.
-So what?

366
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,668
It means "a child of good fortune."

367
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:35,297
Foundlings bring good luck,
so it's customary to bring them inside.

368
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:38,717
You heard her. I'll take care of her
until we find her parents.

369
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,428
Hey!

370
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:53,149
Want some?

371
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:08,205
How is it?

372
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:10,332
Well, it's not bad.

373
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:12,835
What kind of food do you like?

374
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,840
I'm not picky, but if I had to choose,
I'd say naengmyeon.

375
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:20,718
What's your ideal type?

376
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:23,554
My type?

377
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:28,726
I mean, what kind of person do you like?

378
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,605
That would be someone stronger than me.

379
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:38,068
Find a common ground, no matter what.

380
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:40,112
What are your hobbies?

381
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:42,781
Nowadays, I'm into robbery.

382
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:48,162
Why do you want to be a bandit?

383
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:50,831
Because Yeon wouldn't approve of it.

384
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,960
You brothers are more complicated
than it seems, huh?

385
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:57,505
I've never even met my father.

386
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:02,468
And my human mother called me a monster.

387
00:30:03,052 --> 00:30:05,179
Lee Yeon was my only family.

388
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:08,933
Though he tossed me like trash,
once he was seduced by a human.

389
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:11,310
At least you have family by your side.

390
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,148
What about your parents?

391
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:20,569
Why don't you go back to the sea?
You can live as a mermaid.

392
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:25,866
I like Gyeongseong and singing on stage.

393
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:31,539
I like the shining lights
and the chattering voices--

394
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:32,623
Don't be mistaken.

395
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:36,293
There's no place for a half-demon

396
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:38,462
on this Earth.

397
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:42,925
I'm off.

398
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:25,092
I already have a lot on my plate
with this one.

399
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:27,011
I hate human children.

400
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:31,140
-You liar. Soo-oh liked you the most!
-Who the hell's Soo-oh?

401
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:34,143
Forget it. Just take it to the Baby Box.

402
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,811
There's nothing like that here.

403
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,230
-Why don't we have our guys sell it?
-Come on.

404
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:42,276
I don't believe you two.
You have no humanity at all!

405
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,485
-Are we human?
-Are we human?

406
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,322
No, that's not food.

407
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:49,074
I told you to stop lifting weights.

408
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:51,744
Are you hungry? You want munchies?

409
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:55,331
Off you go.
I'll go buy some baby formula and diapers.

410
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:59,918
Hey, let's go together.
I have an urgent errand to run downtown.

411
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:02,004
You want to die?

412
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:05,174
I'll be right back.
Let's get you some munchies.

413
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:06,759
Gosh.

414
00:32:07,343 --> 00:32:09,386
Hey. Wh-- What should we do?

415
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,389
-Let's discreetly get rid of her.
-We can't do that.

416
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,478
What about casually losing her?

417
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:30,741
I'm sorry it turned out this way,
but this is for your own good. Okay?

418
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:32,660
Find nice parents and live a good life.

419
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:34,036
Gosh, all right!

420
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,170
These are snakeberries.

421
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:45,297
Hong-joo goes crazy for them.

422
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,676
-Let's go.
-Gosh, all right.

423
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:51,762
-Why is she here?
-Did she come looking for us?

424
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:55,391
Wh-- She can't even walk yet!
Which prick did this?

425
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:58,686
-Hurry, before Shin-ju gets back.
-Hurry, hurry!

426
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,563
For goodness' sake!

427
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:06,193
Have a good life, okay?

428
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:17,371
Shit.

429
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:33,178
Hey…

430
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:38,434
Hey, tell me. How do you keep coming back?

431
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,103
Is this even human?

432
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:43,313
Isn't it a demon in disguise?

433
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:45,858
Gosh. I don't believe this.

434
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:48,777
Lee Yeon was an opium addict?

435
00:33:49,403 --> 00:33:51,155
Yes, he was a huge fan.

436
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:53,407
Every demon in Gunsan knew of it.

437
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:56,785
-Ever seen him smoke it?
-He doesn't even smoke cigarettes.

438
00:33:57,286 --> 00:33:59,079
-Did he quit suddenly?
-No way.

439
00:33:59,163 --> 00:34:01,999
Shin-ju stopped by recently,
looking for more opium.

440
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:04,752
You were also victimized by Yeon, right?

441
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:09,506
-I wouldn't say I was victimized--
-We recently formed

442
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,092
a Lee Yeon victims' club.

443
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:14,261
We meet three times a week.

444
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:16,096
VICTIMS' CLUB
FOR DEMONS VICTIMIZED BY THE FOX

445
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,307
We offer therapy sessions
and pumpkin juice for the swelling

446
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,850
to those who took a beating.

447
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:21,685
He beat you?

448
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:24,855
Yes.

449
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:30,319
Just because he didn't like her name,
he beat us like this, and this--

450
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:31,695
What's your name?

451
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:34,490
-Bae Ah-eum.
-Ah-eum.

452
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:36,784
Lee Yeon's girlfriend's name?

453
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:39,369
Ah-eum, Ah-eum, Ah-eum!

454
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:41,121
Ah-eum!

455
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,502
She hates that name the most.

456
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:51,799
So? Where did you say you last saw him?

457
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:58,597
Yeon got on a train to Manchuria?

458
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:04,061
Maybe he got off in Gyeongseong.
It coincides with when he left Gunsan.

459
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:07,105
Jae-yoo.

460
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,858
Go get some opium.

461
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:16,198
What could it be?

462
00:35:17,825 --> 00:35:19,535
The moles on her forehead…

463
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:23,872
-It's the Big Dipper.
-So?

464
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:25,541
It's an asterism that controls death.

465
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,584
But it also means to bring wealth.

466
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:30,671
Geez, something feels off.

467
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:32,798
She keeps coming back,
no matter what we do.

468
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,261
Wh-- Why is it crying?

469
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:38,971
I-- I don't know.

470
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,681
Stop crying.

471
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:43,934
You little brat.
If you want something, just say so.

472
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:46,562
Geez. You think that will make her talk?

473
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:52,818
Okay. Hey, hey.
Don't cry. I'll give this to you.

474
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:54,653
Stop crying.

475
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,031
-Let's knock it out.
-Oh, stop.

476
00:36:01,285 --> 00:36:05,873
She'll die if you do.
You have any opium or sleeping pills?

477
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:08,834
It stopped.

478
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:16,592
Just keep holding her.

479
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:22,055
Come here.

480
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,352
Hey, it's damp.

481
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:29,021
-Gross.
-She must've pooped.

482
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,105
Hey, I'm a germophobe.

483
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,733
-You're the ones who brought her.
-It wasn't me.

484
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:35,736
Let's make a bet. Loser raises her alone.

485
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:41,241
You only have two left, but I have four.

486
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:45,078
-No!
-Goodbye.

487
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:48,957
-It's not over yet.
-No, no!

488
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:51,835
Oh, no!

489
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:55,297
I'm giving you exactly 30 minutes.

490
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,890
Let me tell you something.

491
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,726
I hate humans the most in the world.

492
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:11,480
Especially, the pathetic ones
who can't do anything on their own.

493
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,401
It's no use acting pitiful.

494
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:24,993
Don't cry, or I'll eat you up.

495
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,580
What's so funny?

496
00:37:29,623 --> 00:37:31,458
Are you laughing at me?

497
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:35,754
Wow, what a nice view.

498
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:44,680
Why is it so quiet?

499
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:52,938
-How'd you put her to sleep?
-Didn't take much.

500
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:57,901
-What's that?
-It's nothing.

501
00:37:57,985 --> 00:37:59,152
-Why you--
-Nothing…

502
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:06,284
How could you give her makgeolli?
My goodness.

503
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:09,579
Emergency! It's an emergency!

504
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:12,833
-What's all the fuss about?
-Madame Ryu is back.

505
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:15,293
-Who? Hong-joo?
-She wants to see you.

506
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:17,546
Lord Lee Rang, take the baby and hide! Go!

507
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:20,632
-Why?
-If we get caught, we'll get kicked out!

508
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,052
Gosh, just go.

509
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,805
-Lord Lee Rang.
-Geez.

510
00:38:31,852 --> 00:38:34,396
I think Madame Ryu's scarier than
the red-white mask,

511
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:35,939
so don't make her your enemy.

512
00:38:36,023 --> 00:38:39,276
-Doing what?
-Can't you just pretend to like her?

513
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,486
-No.
-Why not? It's just an act.

514
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:44,364
Because I know her feelings are real.

515
00:38:44,448 --> 00:38:48,160
Even if I make her my enemy,
I don't want to lie to her.

516
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:49,286
She's my friend.

517
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:55,333
Well, he can be so cool sometimes.

518
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:02,591
It stinks!

519
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:08,722
-You're here.
-What's this? You smoke opium?

520
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:11,725
I heard it's good money,
so I might start selling.

521
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:15,812
Are you a thug?
Don't do it, even if it's big money.

522
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:19,816
-I guess I'll smoke it then.
-What? Have you lost your mind?

523
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,152
What if you get addicted?

524
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,030
His eyes are clear.

525
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:26,281
And his hands are steady.

526
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,575
He didn't even flinch at the smell.

527
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:30,577
So why did you call for me?

528
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:36,458
-I have a question.
-Me too.

529
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:39,169
To be fair:

530
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,173
Three questions each.

531
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,010
What if I can't give an answer?

532
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:51,014
-We strip one layer at a time.
-Oh, goodness.

533
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:53,600
First question.

534
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:57,729
Do you remember when we first met?

535
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:01,274
She's testing me.

536
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,319
That's what the opium was about?

537
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,322
Does she know something?

538
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:10,283
How could I forget?

539
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,702
You stabbed me as soon as you saw me.

540
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:18,333
My turn.

541
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,044
Red-white mask. You met him, no?

542
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:24,548
-I did.
-Where is he now?

543
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:27,008
One question at a time.

544
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:29,094
My turn.

545
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:33,765
We swore to protect each other
with our lives…

546
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:36,309
And if we break it?

547
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:40,939
-We die by each other's hands.
-Yeon…

548
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:45,735
I intend to keep that promise.

549
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:49,823
-Why did you choose him over me?
-I haven't made my decision yet.

550
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:52,284
Last question.

551
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:58,165
What am I to you?

552
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:04,462
I can't give you the answer you want.

553
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:08,049
I would never trick you

554
00:41:09,176 --> 00:41:11,344
to get you on my side.

555
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:13,430
Over my dead body.

556
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:21,354
You just had to say one word.
Even then and now, you're so uptight.

557
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:25,150
Who's behind the mask? He knows me, right?

558
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:28,028
Perhaps, I know him too.

559
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,289
H-- Hey! Cut it out.

560
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,627
The more layers, the prettier you look.

561
00:41:44,294 --> 00:41:48,256
Oh, right. Take this.

562
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,217
I don't know if you still like them.

563
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:52,302
I'm off, then.

564
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,872
Hong-joo, what's wrong?

565
00:42:22,082 --> 00:42:23,625
I got a letter from home.

566
00:42:24,376 --> 00:42:26,169
My youngest brother is very sick.

567
00:42:26,253 --> 00:42:28,755
Then tell Taluipa and go home.

568
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:34,344
She said, if I leave this place,
I won't ever become a mountain god.

569
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:36,763
That evil old hag!

570
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,812
Hold on.

571
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,868
Here. Snakeberries.

572
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:01,454
They make sad thoughts go away.

573
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,250
This is what snakes eat.

574
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,836
So you have to pluck one eyelash
before you eat one.

575
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:10,088
It purifies the poison.

576
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:26,229
What do you think? Am I right?

577
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:01,139
Jae-yoo.

578
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,391
Yes, ma'am.

579
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:08,313
We're going to Manchuria.
Pack your things.

580
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:13,902
On the count of three. One, two, three!

581
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:18,448
JAMI GOLD MINE

582
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:32,754
Mother's bawling her eyes out, Father.
All her jewelry were stolen.

583
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:36,800
That's not important right now.
We have another gold mine!

584
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:38,468
Put it on the front page.

585
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:42,097
I, Sunwoo Chan,
may have been robbed thirty-six times,

586
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,515
but I'm good as ever!

587
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:46,810
As you, the owner of the paper,
use the press for personal reasons?

588
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:51,147
I'm also promoting the Governor-General's
new gold production policies.

589
00:44:51,231 --> 00:44:54,234
It's all for the good of the country.

590
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:56,820
There's over 5,000 mines
under development.

591
00:44:57,821 --> 00:45:01,116
Whether children or women,
the whole country's nuts over gold mines.

592
00:45:02,951 --> 00:45:04,661
Look at this.

593
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:08,873
This is the era of gold bringing in money.

594
00:45:08,957 --> 00:45:11,376
Hello, Mr. Sunwoo Chan.

595
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:16,172
Miss.

596
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,009
I'm from Jongno Station.

597
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:25,056
-What is this?
-I heard an interesting rumor recently.

598
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:28,560
Unsan Gold Mine from Pyongan,
Jiksan Gold Mine from Cheonan,

599
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:30,103
and Gahak Gold Mine from Gwangmyeong--

600
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:33,440
I heard a man appeared
wherever the gold mines did.

601
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:38,069
-Who?
-The Joseon people call him a fortune god.

602
00:45:39,154 --> 00:45:40,155
A fortune god?

603
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:42,657
He's an indigenous god
that brings good fortune.

604
00:45:43,992 --> 00:45:46,786
You came all the way here
because of some superstition?

605
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:50,206
With all due respect,

606
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:55,462
have you seen a man wearing
a bamboo hat with a Taoist Hermit's beard?

607
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:58,131
I hear he munches on carrots,
like a rabbit.

608
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:15,773
Father.

609
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:19,986
C-- Catch that guy.

610
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:22,322
-Get him!
-Yes, sir.

611
00:46:35,418 --> 00:46:36,961
Lord Lee Rang!

612
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:40,507
Lord Lee Rang!

613
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:45,512
Lord Lee Rang!

614
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:57,023
Make a bet!

615
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:02,195
Which one will it be? Where could it be?

616
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:04,739
-It's not there!
-Damn it!

617
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,951
-Damn, my money! My mo--
-Thank you, sirs.

618
00:47:08,535 --> 00:47:09,661
Boss!

619
00:47:12,664 --> 00:47:13,665
Come here.

620
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:16,376
Twelve months in a year,
thirteen the past year,

621
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:19,796
365 days in a year.
This doesn't come every day or month.

622
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:22,674
Don't be picky. Just pick one.

623
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:24,884
-You done reciting?
-Number two!

624
00:47:24,968 --> 00:47:27,262
-Number two.
-Okay, I'll bet.

625
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:29,430
-Number two.
-Anyone else?

626
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:32,642
Here we go. Will it be number one?

627
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:35,812
-What? You pick number three?
-Oh, dear. It's not there.

628
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:38,648
-The tiny brat's already gambling?
-Which one will it be?

629
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:40,400
-Oh, no. It's not two!
-No!

630
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:42,735
-It's in number three.
-Yes!

631
00:47:42,819 --> 00:47:44,821
-Gosh.
-Thank you.

632
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:46,197
Hey, hurry up. Next bet.

633
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:48,074
One nyang becomes two,

634
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:49,909
two nyangs to four, four to eight,

635
00:47:49,993 --> 00:47:51,786
eight nyangs to ten, then a hundred.

636
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,997
Look here. Where could it be?

637
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,624
Here we go. Where is it?

638
00:47:56,708 --> 00:47:58,668
-It's over here.
-No, number two.

639
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:00,545
-I got it.
-Number two.

640
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:01,713
Number two.

641
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:04,632
Number three again?

642
00:48:04,716 --> 00:48:06,342
-I'm sure.
-I told you so.

643
00:48:06,426 --> 00:48:09,262
Is it number two? Oh, dear. It's not!

644
00:48:09,345 --> 00:48:11,347
It's number three. Congratulations.

645
00:48:11,431 --> 00:48:14,892
-Take that, then.
-That's strange.

646
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:18,521
-You're pretty good.
-Here. Thank you, sir.

647
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,523
Dongdaemun? Where will we go?

648
00:48:20,607 --> 00:48:23,067
Pick one, pick one.

649
00:48:23,151 --> 00:48:26,362
-Pick and choose one.
-I won't fall for it again.

650
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:30,199
Do it again. Which one is it?

651
00:48:31,284 --> 00:48:34,662
-Number one? Okay.
-Number three.

652
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:39,000
Okay, then. Let's go backwards this time.

653
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:42,003
-It's not there.
-What? Oh, no!

654
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:43,880
It's not here either.

655
00:48:45,173 --> 00:48:47,342
-It's in number one, sir.
-Wow, what are you?

656
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:50,386
Here you go. Thank you.

657
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:52,972
Where'd it go? Where could it be?

658
00:48:54,223 --> 00:48:55,558
Number two?

659
00:48:55,642 --> 00:48:58,227
-Number one.
-Okay, number one.

660
00:48:58,311 --> 00:49:01,064
-I'll go with the baby!
-Me too. Number two.

661
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:03,941
-All right.
-What does the baby know?

662
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:06,069
It's not in number one.

663
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:08,446
Number two.

664
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:11,574
It's in here. Congratulations.

665
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:16,329
Go away, kid. Go away, kid.

666
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:20,416
Where will my hand go? Look carefully.

667
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,378
If you look close enough,
your fate may change.

668
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:27,006
Now, where is it? Where is it?

669
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:28,633
One more time.

670
00:49:32,929 --> 00:49:33,971
Number three?

671
00:49:35,765 --> 00:49:36,891
Number three.

672
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:40,019
I bet everything.

673
00:49:40,687 --> 00:49:42,772
Well, let's see.

674
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,026
Number two.

675
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,697
-It's not there!
-It's number three!

676
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:51,781
Wow!

677
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:55,243
You really bring good luck.

678
00:49:55,326 --> 00:50:00,039
Lucky baby! Lucky baby!

679
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:08,715
Fur, pearls, and expensive bananas.
What is all this?

680
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:10,591
I was in a good mood, so I splurged.

681
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:15,930
-What happened downtown?
-Nothing happened.

682
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,102
Why?

683
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:25,148
Oh, sheesh.

684
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:29,110
-What's all this?
-I won it!

685
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:33,781
-You gambled in front of a baby?
-She's no joke. Let's keep her!

686
00:50:34,657 --> 00:50:35,658
Really?

687
00:50:37,577 --> 00:50:40,163
-You see this?
-We'll raise you, baby.

688
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:42,290
Gosh, my head hurts.

689
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:44,375
Goodness.

690
00:51:11,277 --> 00:51:12,987
I wonder what's in Manchuria.

691
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:16,282
You said the man
at Myoyeongak is Lee Yeon.

692
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:18,785
So what do you wish to check?

693
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:23,289
-That one's not an opium addict.
-What do you mean?

694
00:51:24,457 --> 00:51:25,792
I must see it with my own eyes.

695
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:28,252
The other nine-tailed fox
who went to Manchuria.

696
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:31,714
Excuse me, ma'am.

697
00:51:33,633 --> 00:51:35,384
Why do you like Lord Lee Yeon?

698
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:48,648
I never got to play house as a kid.

699
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:51,692
Because my life was a constant battle.

700
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:54,487
But when I'm with him, I feel comforted.

701
00:51:57,907 --> 00:51:58,908
It's strange.

702
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:02,245
He doesn't even know how
to say kind words.

703
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:24,684
CHEON HO-YEONG

704
00:52:27,979 --> 00:52:29,063
Brother.

705
00:52:30,398 --> 00:52:31,566
Have you been well?

706
00:52:39,991 --> 00:52:41,826
Will Dad scold me?

707
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:47,039
-So why did you run away?
-I don't want to be a mountain god.

708
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:49,292
You should be one.

709
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:53,337
A child qualified to be one
is chosen by Taluipa.

710
00:52:53,421 --> 00:52:56,591
I don't like fighting and I find it scary.

711
00:52:59,427 --> 00:53:03,389
I'm sure you'll become
a great mountain god.

712
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:05,892
You're my little brother, after all.

713
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:28,831
Brother, tell me I'm on the right path.

714
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:36,923
Let me sleep.

715
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:47,391
Why does she need a name?

716
00:53:47,475 --> 00:53:50,019
Even abandoned pets have names.

717
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:55,191
Then what about Kim Du-han?
He grew up to be strong.

718
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:57,735
Du-han? But she's a girl.

719
00:53:58,945 --> 00:54:01,405
How about a hip name?
She's from the streets, you know.

720
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:04,575
-What about Coco?
-Coco! Wait--

721
00:54:04,659 --> 00:54:07,828
Please be more sincere.
Humans' fates depend on their names.

722
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:11,916
Gumiho for nine-tailed?

723
00:54:13,709 --> 00:54:16,045
How about Lee Mi-ho,
taking your family name?

724
00:54:18,089 --> 00:54:20,049
Lee Mi-ho?

725
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:25,388
Hey, Lee Mi-ho.

726
00:54:31,394 --> 00:54:34,689
-Don't touch me.
-I think Mi-ho likes it too.

727
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:35,773
Hey, Mi-ho!

728
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:38,901
Hey, Koo Shin-ju. Come here.

729
00:54:41,654 --> 00:54:44,532
Mi-ho, Mi-ho, Mi-ho!

730
00:54:50,997 --> 00:54:53,124
What'll you do with her once time's up?

731
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:55,376
-You going to take her with you?
-Oh, can I?

732
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:59,171
I know you can't even pass up a stray dog.

733
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:04,301
But it's a completely different thing
to take responsibility for a human.

734
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:07,805
Do you hate Mi-ho that much?

735
00:55:08,848 --> 00:55:12,935
It's not that I hate her.
You know I raised Rang.

736
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:18,190
It's all my fault that he joined
a bandit gang and that he died.

737
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:20,276
Because I failed to protect him.

738
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:23,070
But you did your best.

739
00:55:23,154 --> 00:55:26,073
Find proper parents
who can raise her, for her sake.

740
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:43,215
We were able to catch him,
but torture and blackmail won't work.

741
00:55:43,299 --> 00:55:45,009
He just eats carrots all day.

742
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:47,845
And he's the fortune god of Joseon?

743
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:50,556
He's been sighted in gold mines
all over the country.

744
00:55:51,307 --> 00:55:55,019
Whether he's the fortune god or not,
I'm sure he knows how to find gold.

745
00:55:56,062 --> 00:55:57,897
Do whatever you can to make him talk.

746
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:01,233
For military expansion,

747
00:56:01,317 --> 00:56:03,861
our priority is to secure
the only international currency: gold.

748
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:05,196
Yes, sir.

749
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,417
Can we even use a man like him?

750
00:56:18,501 --> 00:56:25,091
He is flaunting his useless power
over those who are weaker than him.

751
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:29,095
Who better to use than him.

752
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:32,890
Any movement from Ginko?

753
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:35,142
Though I am a little worried,

754
00:56:35,226 --> 00:56:38,062
she hasn't gone anywhere
other than the tennis court.

755
00:56:40,189 --> 00:56:41,941
She regularly goes to this boutique store.

756
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,443
Is that so?

757
00:56:51,659 --> 00:56:53,452
Look at the map properly!

758
00:56:53,536 --> 00:56:55,704
Locate the gold
if you want to get out alive!

759
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:04,797
What I do best,
is sever tendons of someone like you.

760
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:08,551
-Must be hard work.
-You bastard!

761
00:57:18,978 --> 00:57:20,479
All right. Fine.

762
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:25,067
Tell me, tell me. What is it you want?

763
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:31,532
Please find a baby for me.

764
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:38,122
-Excuse me.
-What's wrong?

765
00:57:38,706 --> 00:57:40,082
-Stop that!
-It's not her. Shit.

766
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:41,667
Find her, quick!

767
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,502
-Yes, sir.
-Scour the place!

768
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:48,048
REWARD: ONE MILLION WON
JONGNO POLICE STATION

769
00:57:50,885 --> 00:57:52,511
-Out of the way!
-Out, out!

770
00:57:52,595 --> 00:57:55,014
What is this?

771
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:00,769
Is it an orphanage?

772
00:58:01,854 --> 00:58:05,816
The Government-General runs the place.
It's a facility for orphans.

773
00:58:06,609 --> 00:58:10,487
-I'm telling you not to send her.
-All you do is gamble with her.

774
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:12,573
Mi-ho, how could I send you off?

775
00:58:16,869 --> 00:58:17,870
Is there a spectacle?

776
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:22,124
Oh, that?
Jongno Station is looking for a baby.

777
00:58:22,208 --> 00:58:24,293
The reward is enough to buy a house.

778
00:58:28,172 --> 00:58:32,509
If I catch her,
I can turn my life around in one go!

779
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:37,932
Wait a minute.

780
00:58:38,974 --> 00:58:39,975
L-- Look.

781
00:58:40,059 --> 00:58:41,685
-It's her!
-I found the baby!

782
00:58:41,769 --> 00:58:43,729
-Lord Lee Yeon, go!
-Over here!

783
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:51,153
Stop right there!

784
00:58:51,654 --> 00:58:52,780
Get him!

785
00:58:55,491 --> 00:58:57,993
-Shit!
-Get 'em! Go, get him!

786
00:58:58,077 --> 00:58:59,411
To the right! Turn right!

787
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,461
-Stop right there!
-Stop, you bastards!

788
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:10,130
-Come here, you--
-I got him!

789
00:59:10,965 --> 00:59:12,007
Let go!

790
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:17,304
-Oh, no!
-Hey!

791
00:59:20,307 --> 00:59:22,685
-Goodness gracious!
-Oh, dear.

792
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,698
Stop! Don't lose him!

793
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:36,782
Catch him!

794
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:50,963
-How old is your baby?
-I wouldn't know.

795
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:58,304
-Right?
-I think it's her.

796
00:59:59,847 --> 01:00:01,015
May I see the baby?

797
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:04,935
-Why do you ask?
-I think it's her.

798
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:07,062
Get him!

799
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:10,357
Damn.

800
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:14,987
-Get him!
-Wait, damn you!

801
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:21,744
-You're blocking the screen.
-Move.

802
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:28,709
-Go! Get him!
-Hey, stop!

803
01:00:34,423 --> 01:00:36,508
Hey, get out of the way.

804
01:00:41,263 --> 01:00:42,639
Get him!

805
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:52,107
Get out of here!

806
01:00:53,484 --> 01:00:55,778
-Get out!
-What?

807
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:57,821
Have you never cried before, huh?

808
01:00:58,572 --> 01:00:59,948
Oh, I'm sorry.

809
01:01:03,744 --> 01:01:05,412
You!

810
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:11,460
Go, get him!

811
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:15,839
Shoot!

812
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:23,931
You're okay.

813
01:01:25,641 --> 01:01:29,103
Here. Wait here a second.

814
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:32,106
I'll be right back. I won't be long.

815
01:01:34,108 --> 01:01:35,317
Get him!

816
01:01:35,401 --> 01:01:38,821
I wanted to refrain from using violence
for the baby, but damn it!

817
01:01:56,505 --> 01:02:00,384
Let go! You bastard!

818
01:02:02,261 --> 01:02:05,889
I'm sorry! Let me go!
Let me go! I'm sorry!

819
01:02:05,973 --> 01:02:07,057
I'm sorry!

820
01:02:07,141 --> 01:02:09,226
How dare you shoot when a child's present?

821
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:12,187
-I'm sorry!
-What the hell are you saying?

822
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:24,283
How dare you bastards shoot
at a child, huh?

823
01:02:25,033 --> 01:02:26,034
Mi-ho!

824
01:02:26,118 --> 01:02:27,870
Mi-ho.

825
01:02:31,123 --> 01:02:33,167
Mi-ho. Mi-ho?

826
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:39,631
Where's the basket?

827
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:41,800
Oh, shit.

828
01:02:41,884 --> 01:02:45,679
Mi-ho. Hey, Mi-ho!

829
01:02:49,475 --> 01:02:50,809
Are they gone?

830
01:02:53,604 --> 01:02:54,646
Welcome.

831
01:02:57,191 --> 01:02:58,484
You know who I am, right?

832
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:02,196
I'm here to buy some clothes.

833
01:03:12,456 --> 01:03:13,457
It's just my style.

834
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,597
Put it on Lord Lee Yeon's tab.

835
01:03:40,275 --> 01:03:41,443
MYOYEONGAK

836
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:46,865
Oh, my-- Mi-ho. I'm sorry.

837
01:03:46,949 --> 01:03:49,034
It's my fault. I'm so sorry.

838
01:03:58,418 --> 01:04:02,130
Gosh. She's burning up.

839
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:05,759
-Let's call a doctor.
-No. I don't trust anyone.

840
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:09,221
You sure the gisaengs will keep quiet?

841
01:04:09,304 --> 01:04:10,305
Yes.

842
01:04:11,515 --> 01:04:14,017
Mi-ho, why are you sick?

843
01:04:20,274 --> 01:04:21,692
Goodness.

844
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:23,610
Let's get the fever down.

845
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:28,407
Were you like this when I was sick?

846
01:04:30,659 --> 01:04:34,496
You always fell ill when you were little.
Do you know how troubled I was?

847
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:36,582
I fed you everything
that was good for you.

848
01:04:37,249 --> 01:04:38,709
Well, I don't remember.

849
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:41,628
This is why they say
you get no credit for raising a kid.

850
01:04:44,548 --> 01:04:49,720
Why did you take me in?
You didn't even know you had a brother.

851
01:04:51,263 --> 01:04:52,389
Father told me.

852
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:54,850
What?

853
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:59,104
When I was little,
he left me with the old hag.

854
01:04:59,187 --> 01:05:00,981
I never knew if he was alive or dead.

855
01:05:02,107 --> 01:05:03,650
One day, he just showed up and said,

856
01:05:03,734 --> 01:05:06,236
"I forgot to tell you,
but you might have a brother."

857
01:05:06,862 --> 01:05:09,698
-I'll kill him if I ever see him.
-What a good son.

858
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:11,408
I'll help out.

859
01:05:14,745 --> 01:05:17,414
What was he like? Our so-called father.

860
01:05:18,332 --> 01:05:19,666
I don't even know his face.

861
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:23,003
He'd use me as an archery target,
feed me poisonous mushrooms,

862
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:25,005
and tie me to a rock
to throw me in the river.

863
01:05:26,673 --> 01:05:29,301
So you turning out this way
is no coincidence.

864
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,057
Why isn't her fever going down?

865
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:49,071
Hey. You're here.

866
01:05:55,911 --> 01:05:57,162
Mi-ho.

867
01:06:10,175 --> 01:06:11,176
Her fever went down.

868
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:12,386
Yeah, I'm so glad.

869
01:06:14,262 --> 01:06:18,141
From now on,
I'm in charge of raising Mi-ho.

870
01:06:21,228 --> 01:06:22,604
You're doing a good job.

871
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:25,524
Make sure it's spotless, okay?

872
01:06:25,607 --> 01:06:26,942
-Yes, sir.
-Okay. Good work.

873
01:06:31,071 --> 01:06:33,407
Great work, everyone.

874
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:36,493
Don't leave any traces of gambling.

875
01:06:37,244 --> 01:06:39,955
Make sure there's not
a single speck of dust.

876
01:06:40,038 --> 01:06:43,166
-It's bad for her bronchial tubes, okay?
-Yes, sir.

877
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:47,129
What the? What's that smell?

878
01:06:47,212 --> 01:06:49,131
Who the hell is smoking?

879
01:06:49,214 --> 01:06:50,841
Give this to me.

880
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:52,217
Put that cigarette out.

881
01:06:52,801 --> 01:06:54,678
-Hey, you!
-No smoking. Starting today.

882
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:57,472
-Why you--
-Only use nice words.

883
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:05,856
-Is that baby lotion?
-I'm not sure.

884
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:07,315
Check for parabens.

885
01:07:07,399 --> 01:07:08,650
Here.

886
01:07:08,734 --> 01:07:11,903
-Hey, it's organic, right?
-What's "organic"?

887
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,197
Never mind.

888
01:07:16,867 --> 01:07:17,868
Mi-ho.

889
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:20,370
Let's eat lunch when you're all done.

890
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:25,959
Put her down now. You'll spoil her.

891
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:29,713
Attachment forms at this age.
Don't question my infant care philosophy.

892
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:31,715
How long should I recite this?

893
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:33,925
Until Mi-ho falls asleep.

894
01:07:34,009 --> 01:07:36,511
I'm going to send her
to Seoul National University.

895
01:07:36,595 --> 01:07:38,638
Geez, you're so dramatic.

896
01:07:48,148 --> 01:07:50,108
You like this, don't you?

897
01:07:51,443 --> 01:07:52,694
Look here.

898
01:08:27,229 --> 01:08:29,731
OBOK BOUTIQUE

899
01:08:30,482 --> 01:08:35,654
Gosh, where did that shirt go?
I'm certain I hid it here.

900
01:08:36,363 --> 01:08:37,656
The codes are written on it.

901
01:08:37,739 --> 01:08:40,242
If it gets out, the whole organization
will be compromised.

902
01:08:40,325 --> 01:08:42,202
Exactly.

903
01:08:44,246 --> 01:08:46,331
-What are you looking for?
-Yeo-hee.

904
01:08:46,414 --> 01:08:48,291
Have you seen a floral shirt here?

905
01:08:48,959 --> 01:08:50,460
It was sold yesterday.

906
01:08:53,255 --> 01:08:54,339
To who?

907
01:08:54,422 --> 01:08:57,634
Where on earth can I buy baby powder?

908
01:08:58,718 --> 01:08:59,761
What in the--

909
01:08:59,845 --> 01:09:01,513
Gosh. This is driving me crazy.

910
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:09,646
Excuse me.

911
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:13,567
-Me?
-I had that shirt custom-made.

912
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:15,652
It's mine.

913
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:19,447
Name the price.
I'll pay however much you want.

914
01:09:19,531 --> 01:09:21,616
Apologies, but I won't sell.

915
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:26,037
Apologies, ma'am.

916
01:09:26,121 --> 01:09:27,163
You're him.

917
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:35,589
MANCHURIA

918
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:18,006
Look what we have here.

919
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:35,941
Wow!

920
01:10:47,661 --> 01:10:50,789
Let's see. Seven moles on the forehead.

921
01:10:50,872 --> 01:10:52,415
-It's her.
-Who are you?

922
01:10:52,499 --> 01:10:54,918
I'm Detective Jung Dae-seung
from Jongno Station.

923
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:57,087
-So what?
-Give me the baby.

924
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:58,630
What?

925
01:11:03,969 --> 01:11:04,970
Hurry up.

926
01:11:07,722 --> 01:11:08,723
Geez.

927
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:11,184
How typical.

928
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:17,607
-Let them go.
-The baby comes first.

929
01:11:17,691 --> 01:11:20,110
-Please help us.
-Then I have no choice.

930
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:23,738
Mi-ho.

931
01:11:26,408 --> 01:11:28,660
-Here.
-Are you out of your mind?

932
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:33,832
Usually, the protagonists end up
losing the baby like idiots.

933
01:11:33,915 --> 01:11:37,127
-But we're no ordinary humans.
-Who the hell are you guys?

934
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:40,630
Something like the Green Mother's Society.

935
01:11:41,923 --> 01:11:45,677
-Anyway, you're all screwed today.
-You crazy bastard.

936
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:49,931
Watch your language in front of the baby.

937
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:51,182
You bastard.

938
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,811
Oh? All right.

939
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:01,651
Should I stomp him?

940
01:12:02,569 --> 01:12:03,570
Let's stomp.

941
01:12:04,154 --> 01:12:05,363
Take this!

942
01:12:20,545 --> 01:12:21,546
Shoo--

943
01:12:32,474 --> 01:12:37,187
TALE OF THE NINE TAILED

944
01:13:02,504 --> 01:13:04,089
What's this?

945
01:13:04,756 --> 01:13:05,882
He reeks of blood.

946
01:13:09,552 --> 01:13:11,096
The governor's office offered a deal.

947
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:14,557
-If I don't bring the baby--
-Where is Hong-joo right now?

948
01:13:14,641 --> 01:13:16,392
I won't forgive you.

949
01:13:16,476 --> 01:13:17,769
The gold mines…

950
01:13:17,852 --> 01:13:19,187
I found gold!

951
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:22,315
-If I bring the kidnapped Orchid…
-Don't be scared.

952
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:24,025
…he'll tell me the baby's location.

953
01:13:24,526 --> 01:13:26,945
Lee Yeon and I will fight to the death.

954
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:30,073
My dear friends are about to start a war.

955
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:31,991
Who are you?

956
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:33,868
It's me.
