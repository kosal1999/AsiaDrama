1
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:56,974
TALE OF THE NINE TAILED

2
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,686
EPISODE 7

3
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,232
Gwanghwamun?

4
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,577
What? We're in the Joseon Dynasty period?

5
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:18,829
Whenever this is, we find Hong-joo first.

6
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,291
Geez, seriously.

7
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,507
What the--

8
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:37,473
Moo-yeong, no! Don't breathe!

9
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:51,529
What's this? Hey!

10
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:54,156
-Hey, Moo-yeong!
-I can't untie the ropes!

11
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:55,908
Oh, gosh--

12
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:05,334
No, no, no!
Ladies, no. Let's talk it out, huh?

13
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:06,877
Let's talk! Come on!

14
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:25,646
Hey, Moo-yeong!

15
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:28,607
We're not dead. What is this?

16
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:33,904
This is fake blood.

17
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:40,619
It's a waste to throw away
an expensive knife that's become blunt.

18
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:42,580
Here we go.

19
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,795
Just push and pull a few times
with this versatile knife sharpener.

20
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:52,131
Wow! It's like a brand-new sword!

21
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,215
MAGIC SWORD SHARPENER

22
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:55,801
The ergonomic design ensures a secure grip

23
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:58,178
-with no slippage.
-And cut! Okay!

24
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,062
Change for the next scene. Hurry!

25
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:08,480
IN SUPPORT
OF JANGSAN TIGER'S BRIDE

26
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,235
Let's get up. We'll resume in ten!

27
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,320
Give me that.

28
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:18,032
"Jangsan Tiger's Bride"?

29
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:23,370
It's a TV series set.
It's not even the Joseon Dynasty period.

30
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:25,372
So this is the world he created?

31
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:27,458
First, let's get off this damn set.

32
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,927
Is this a TV series or a damn commercial?

33
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,971
The script is crap,
and it's not even complete!

34
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:44,516
-We need an extra bucketful of blood.
-Get me corn syrup and pigment.

35
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,355
Look at the details.
It looks like an actual set.

36
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:51,774
But how is this possible?

37
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:55,653
No matter how powerful a demon,
he can't cross over time.

38
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:58,280
-Where on earth could Hong-joo be?
-Gosh. Damn it.

39
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:02,326
-Hey, is the female lead late again?
-She just arrived, sir.

40
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,829
A-listers think they're everything, huh?

41
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:10,709
Damn it. How do we find her?
Let's go look over there.

42
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,339
Welcome, ma'am.

43
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:30,062
-Hong-joo!
-I'm so glad you're safe.

44
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,314
What's this?

45
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,149
Who are they?

46
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:37,194
This is male number four and five.

47
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:42,741
Since when do supporting actors
get to talk to me?

48
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,996
Apologies, ma'am. They're new. Sorry.

49
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,415
-Remove 'em.
-No, Hong-joo. That's not…

50
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,208
-Hey!
-Please move.

51
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,459
I'm so sorry, ma'am…

52
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,256
-That's Hong-joo, right?
-Why can't she recognize us?

53
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,425
Is she bewitched by Jangsan Tiger?

54
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,428
This won't do. Let's drag her out.

55
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,516
But why is she the main lead,
while I'm some minor supporting role?

56
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,852
Why are you number four
when I'm number five, huh?

57
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,896
-Does that matter now?
-Of course it does!

58
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,981
Jangsan Tiger, that prick…

59
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,068
Ready, action!

60
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,492
-Where are we now?
-Why are we here?

61
00:05:26,452 --> 00:05:31,248
Hey, your clothes--
Hat-- Geez, what's this now?

62
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,626
Who's there?

63
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,089
Hong-joo.

64
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:43,927
Hong-joo.

65
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,929
-It's me, Moo-yeong.
-It's Moo-yeong.

66
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:49,141
-Moo-yeong?
-Why can't you remember me, your friend?

67
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:54,480
I got amnesia after I fell in the lake.

68
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:57,983
Now I've seen everything.
Hey, forget this crap and come with us.

69
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:02,071
-I won't go. No, I can't.
-Why not?

70
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:04,990
Because he is my only groom.

71
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,329
Get a grip, you brat!
You're bewitched by Jangsan Tiger. Come.

72
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,206
Cut! Stop filming!

73
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,874
-Gosh, seriously!
-Hey!

74
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,167
-Oh, my!
-What's this now?

75
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:19,046
What agency are you from, huh?
How dare you smack an actress!

76
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,507
My goodness.
Where did you find these pricks?

77
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,551
-Sorry, ma'am. Let's do another take.
-I'm so annoyed!

78
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,261
Says who?

79
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:28,931
I won't go. No, I can't.

80
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:31,975
Because he is my only groom.

81
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,144
-Is this the scene from earlier?
-So it seems.

82
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:37,856
-Shit-- Enough with this crap!
-Cut! Take three!

83
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:42,653
-I won't go. No, I can't.
-Sheesh.

84
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,321
Cut! Take four!

85
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:47,324
I won't go. No, I can't.

86
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:51,703
Because he is my only groom.

87
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:54,039
This is driving me nuts!
Why are we repeating lines?

88
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,875
Hey, there's a script.

89
00:06:57,543 --> 00:07:00,129
-Because he is my only groom.
-"Sure.

90
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:03,298
Jangsan Tiger is stronger
and more beautiful than us.

91
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,596
-But we're here to save you."
-What's with the script? Seriously.

92
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,681
Just read it.

93
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:16,603
"Moo-yeong, shouldn't we leave,
for Hong-joo's happiness?

94
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:19,439
Open parenthesis.
Speaks in tears. Close parenthesis.

95
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:21,692
-Hong-joo, you belong here."
-That's so not…

96
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,195
You may have been my friends,

97
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:30,033
but you're a fake and you're a villain.

98
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,329
You think I'm a fake?

99
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,332
There are two of you.

100
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,544
And the opium addict in Manchuria
is the real one.

101
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:41,962
There are two of you.

102
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:45,174
And the opium addict in Manchuria
is the real one.

103
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:51,805
HONG-JOO: THERE ARE TWO OF YOU…

104
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,474
What? How is this line in the script?

105
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,312
That bastard knows more about us
than we imagined.

106
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,230
This feels bad. Let's get her out.

107
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,238
The pain of sending them off--

108
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,741
I should comfort myself
with this makgeolli.

109
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:14,870
MOUNTAIN GOD MAKGEOLLI
MADE FROM 100% DOMESTIC RICE

110
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:17,581
Long-term, low-temperature
ripening-fermentation method

111
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,665
preserves fresh yeast.

112
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:20,626
Plus, no burping or hangovers!

113
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,672
-And cut! Okay!
-Great.

114
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:30,260
-Great work, ma'am!
-Gosh, it's seriously so heavy! Move it.

115
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,764
Great work, ma'am.

116
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,974
-Hurry up!
-I'm hungry. Out of my way!

117
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:37,059
What do we do?

118
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:40,520
Hong-joo's in such a state.
Plus, we can't get out of here on our own.

119
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:45,317
-He's much stronger than I thought.
-Hey, let's just burn this whole set.

120
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,237
-Will that be okay?
-Of course, it's an illusion anyway.

121
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,321
Light 'em up.

122
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,582
-What are you doing?
-I can't start a fire.

123
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,084
-You try.
-Gosh.

124
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,589
Damn it! What's going on?

125
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:10,801
-Lightning, thunder-- Nothing works.
-Our skills mustn't work here.

126
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,181
Wait, hold on.

127
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:19,601
The show's called Jangsan Tiger's Bride.

128
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:21,770
If Hong-joo is the bride…

129
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,231
he must be in here too.

130
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:27,734
Let's catch the prick first.

131
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,865
Yeon and Moo-yeong did what?

132
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:36,785
How dare they recklessly jump
into such a place?

133
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:38,954
-What kind of place is it?
-Look.

134
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,707
This is the Living, and this is the Dead.

135
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,001
The Path of the Damned lies
between the two.

136
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,128
It seems like reality at first glance,

137
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,922
but it's a playground
for demons thousands of years old!

138
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,717
It's a place neither we, nor the gods,
carelessly enter!

139
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,593
On top of that, it's Jangsan Tiger.

140
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,139
And who exactly is this guy?

141
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,224
An impersonator.

142
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,569
Once upon a time,
there lived a tiger at Jangsan,

143
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:14,239
that had a knack for imitating others.

144
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:18,118
At first, it imitated the sound of beasts.
Then, the sound of humans.

145
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:21,330
And finally, it began imitating the gods.

146
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,667
-By god, you mean--
-It coveted the place of a mountain god.

147
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:30,547
-He wanted to become a mountain god?
-He doesn't only imitate voices.

148
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,259
He can imitate
everything one sees, hears, or says.

149
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,845
Including one's memories.

150
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:39,514
How does Yeon intend to return?

151
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:43,268
He has a silk thread tied to him,
and Lord Lee Rang has the skein.

152
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:44,644
The path remains open?

153
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,897
-You imbeciles!
-Why? What's wrong?

154
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:49,983
He'll try to cross over from that world.

155
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,194
Lee Rang is in danger!

156
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,237
What?

157
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:13,006
Hello? Hello?

158
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:16,551
-Koo Shin-ju?
-Lord Lee Rang! He's coming!

159
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:20,138
-What are you talking about?
-There's no time. Listen to me carefully.

160
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,892
Put your blood on the thread. Hurry!

161
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:41,910
Okay. I did it.

162
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,705
So everything's prepared, huh?

163
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,542
Prepared for what?

164
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:50,877
For me to enter that world.

165
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:54,965
He's not Shin-ju!

166
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:15,694
-He's not picking up?
-The line's busy. I'll go check.

167
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,781
Go tell him that whatever he does,
he mustn't get blood on the thread.

168
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:22,325
-It's like an invitation to them!
-Yes, sir.

169
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,119
If he lets go of the thread,

170
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:27,873
-the way back will disappear.
-Lord Lee Rang won't let go of it. Ever.

171
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:34,671
I can't believe it's Jangsan Tiger.

172
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:39,551
-Is it a coincidence they encountered him?
-I'm sure it was Moo-yeong.

173
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:42,929
He needs Jangsan Tiger to fix his body.

174
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:47,684
While oblivious to his deep resentment
of mountain gods…

175
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,728
Honey, what should we do about the kids?

176
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,899
They have no choice
but to figure it out for themselves.

177
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,693
To bring Hong-joo back from that world,

178
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,279
eventually,

179
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,699
they'll have to save each other.

180
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,953
-I'll take one.
-Yes.

181
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:08,163
Excuse me.

182
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:12,209
So, I was wondering.
Who wrote this script?

183
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,919
The director wrote it himself.

184
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,296
-The director?
-Yes.

185
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,474
-Director, sir.
-Yeah?

186
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:32,395
-Well, are you Jangsan Tiger?
-What are you talking about, punk?

187
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:37,234
If you don't know,
then let's have a beating first.

188
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:39,736
What, punk?

189
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,035
You earned this.

190
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:52,040
Who told you to write this crap? Huh?

191
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:57,128
-Sir, I just did what I was told.
-Who told you to do it?

192
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,047
It was…

193
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,466
Who was it again?

194
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,428
-Who the hell is Jangsan Tiger?
-Jangsan Tiger?

195
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,475
Hey, hey!

196
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:26,950
Rang, are you there?

197
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:33,623
Lee Yeon?

198
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:45,343
Lee Yeon?

199
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:50,807
-No. You're not Lee Yeon, are you?
-It is me!

200
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,812
Pull me in. Hurry!
Moo-yeong's been attacked.

201
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,816
-Prove that you're him.
-I said I'll buy you naengmyeon!

202
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,568
I don't have much time. Hurry!

203
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:40,899
Where are you?

204
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,551
Playing with food brings bad fortune.

205
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,178
It's for my darling.

206
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:14,933
Wow. Kids these days will say anything
in front of a widow, huh?

207
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:22,524
What kind of person was your husband?

208
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:27,987
They say a man's feelings change
like the colors of a rainbow tteok,

209
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,825
but his love for me never changed.

210
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,868
Then, what happened?

211
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,997
I fell for a demon's trickeries.

212
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,168
He cared for me so dearly,

213
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,214
but I couldn't protect him.

214
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,719
Yeo-hee.

215
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:53,596
Don't you lose him like I did.

216
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:55,974
Yes, ma'am.

217
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:09,612
-This must be an expensive shoot.
-Yeah.

218
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:26,588
It's you, huh?

219
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,341
-Pardon?
-Jangsan Tiger.

220
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,761
Whatever that is, it's not me.

221
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:36,973
In these genres,
the first person you meet is the suspect.

222
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:38,975
Plus, the rice puffs you're eating--

223
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,479
That's what Hong-joo was eating
during the corner game.

224
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:49,694
One of the staff over there
gave it to me earlier.

225
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:51,237
You liar.

226
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:52,530
I'm not lying.

227
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:55,825
It's not a lie!

228
00:17:58,703 --> 00:17:59,704
Hong-joo?

229
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:07,670
What the hell are you?

230
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,843
Since the ancient times,
I was called an impersonator.

231
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,012
I can become anything.

232
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,647
You bastard. How dare you!

233
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,571
Let's play some more.

234
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:36,324
This is the world you've created.

235
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:52,423
-That's…
-I stole some of your memories.

236
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,094
You die in the Joseon era,
but wake to an unfamiliar future.

237
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:58,471
No friends or family by your side.

238
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:07,397
Was it called a television?
You started imitating the people on it.

239
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:11,484
-Fake crying and laughing.
-Shut your mouth.

240
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:14,988
-You're just like me. The same monster.
-No!

241
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:21,536
-No. I'm nothing like you--
-You're the one who called for me.

242
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:24,497
This woman…

243
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:31,671
-will die because of you.
-No!

244
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:37,844
Now, no one will be left by your side.
You'll wander in the dark forever.

245
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,638
Like when you became stone.

246
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,731
Don't torture my friend with that face.

247
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,529
Well, look at you?

248
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:03,411
What? The duduri doesn't work on you?

249
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:11,461
You don't know much
about your friend, huh?

250
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:13,713
Don't insult us.

251
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:17,842
You're a mere impersonator too afraid
to show your face, so don't you dare.

252
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:25,934
Still arrogant as always, Lee Yeon.
Mountain god of Baekdudaegan.

253
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:29,228
At one point, I wanted to be you.

254
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:35,568
You could never in a million years.
You're just a clown.

255
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:36,778
Moo-yeong!

256
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,830
I'll give you an hour from now.

257
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,584
Try to save this woman, if you can.

258
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:55,964
You're not gods in this world.

259
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,133
I am.

260
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:07,475
What's this?

261
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:08,559
EDEN BOUTIQUE

262
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:10,478
The setting's changed to Gyeongseong.

263
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,861
One hour left.
We must find Hong-joo in time.

264
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,698
How did you find that bastard?

265
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:24,409
The rice puffs Hong-joo was eating.

266
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,204
He say anything else?

267
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:30,915
He can peek into our memories.

268
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:35,670
So this stage was made
from stealing my memories?

269
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:38,673
Since you and Hong-joo
haven't been to the future.

270
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,842
But Moo-yeong…

271
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:45,805
Why didn't my duduri work
on Jangsan Tiger?

272
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:51,269
I'm not sure.

273
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,939
Since it wasn't the main body?

274
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:05,199
You guys the Mountain God gang?

275
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:12,540
Yeah, you're right. But who are you guys?

276
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:14,709
I said who are you?

277
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:26,512
I'm Kim Du-han.

278
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,809
-Kim Du-han of Jongno.
-Mr. Ahn Jae-mo--

279
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:34,562
No way.

280
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:36,773
Gosh, I'm losing my mind!

281
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:40,735
-Get them.
-Out of the blue?

282
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:48,326
Oh, dear. Why are they spinning?

283
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:52,246
Why are they spinning?

284
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,279
You have some lousy skills.

285
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:08,322
What's he saying?

286
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:12,994
I've practically won this fight.

287
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:17,623
I was already reading your moves.

288
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,710
Bring it on.

289
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,325
Shit. Why's he so good?

290
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,721
Spinning again? He keeps spinning!

291
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:30,321
I wonder if their teeth are intact
after getting beat like that.

292
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:36,494
Stop worrying about your teeth.
You have Gyeongseong dental insurance!

293
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:37,912
DENTAL PROCEDURE COSTS
DON'T WORRY!

294
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:39,413
FOR IMPLANTS, CROWNS
CALL 0001-2570

295
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:42,708
Not only prosthetic treatment,
but also implants, bridges and dentures.

296
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:45,795
Gyeongseong dental insurance
for costly procedures.

297
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:52,343
Early termination fees:
less than the insurance premium if none.

298
00:25:57,932 --> 00:25:59,475
Where the hell are you? Come out!

299
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:17,410
-Boss, please save me…
-Who's there?

300
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,163
Is that you, Underboss?

301
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:24,417
Yes, sir. It's me.

302
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,930
Please cut this thread.
It's choking my neck…

303
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,975
I can't breathe…

304
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,436
How funny. Your height doesn't match.

305
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:46,939
Please… Cut this!

306
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:48,107
You bastard!

307
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,818
-Rang, let go of the thread!
-Shut up!

308
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,237
You must let go to live!

309
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:55,323
Lord Lee Yeon is using you.

310
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:59,035
Get a grip! He'll just use you,
only to abandon you again!

311
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,787
-Just cut the silk thread!
-Just stop!

312
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:19,305
Why…

313
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,391
Why can't I let go of this?

314
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:24,852
Are you that thing?

315
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:27,813
The thing that's born
between my father and a human?

316
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,816
Are you a fox too?

317
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,111
Whether you live as a human or a fox,
it's your choice.

318
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:35,571
But remember this, kid:

319
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:39,658
There's no salvation for those
who don't save themselves.

320
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:00,763
Wait for me!

321
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:04,475
Wait for me, my brother.

322
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:06,060
Ages ago…

323
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:13,401
the hand that held mine,
who was abandoned by a human mother,

324
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:17,071
was annoyingly warm…

325
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:19,990
That's why this…

326
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:22,535
felt like…

327
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,163
the last link I had to Lee Yeon.

328
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:28,916
I won't let go…

329
00:28:30,418 --> 00:28:32,169
Try all you want.

330
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:36,090
I won't ever, ever let go!

331
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:37,633
YEON TALK - LEE YEON

332
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,510
"ASPIRING TALK SHOW HOST"
CHEON MOO-YEONG

333
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:43,347
CHALLENGE
QUIZ KING

334
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:44,765
The setting's changed again.

335
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:48,477
So, it's a quiz show this time.

336
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,857
He's playing games with us,
switching between TV channels.

337
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:55,401
Well, the rules are simple.

338
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,237
Whether we win or lose,

339
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,073
we do what we must
to move on to the next level.

340
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:02,908
You'll dance to his tune again?

341
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:07,329
All we have to do is save Hong-joo.
You don't have other ideas, no?

342
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:09,165
Let's give it a try.

343
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:12,960
Great. Who will it be this time?

344
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:17,214
Nice to meet you.

345
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:20,509
Yes, hello, hello.

346
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:24,472
Hello there.
It's a pleasure to meet you both. Hello?

347
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:31,729
Ho-yeong?

348
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:35,191
-Are you here to solve the quiz?
-Moo-yeong, that's not your brother.

349
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:38,360
Why that sick little…

350
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,948
I'm going to kill him.

351
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:46,827
Will you give up on the quiz?

352
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:51,415
When your girlfriend is dying
at this very moment?

353
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,417
Cheon Moo-yeong, no!

354
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:56,253
-Don't fall for his provocation.
-How dare you.

355
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:59,673
How dare you!

356
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:03,385
Let's sit down, okay?
We don't have much time.

357
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:13,604
Today's show is a "best friends" special.

358
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:15,606
I'll ask you one thing before we start.

359
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:19,235
You two were best friends, right?

360
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,946
If so, why did you kill his older brother?

361
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:34,375
Gosh, is this too delicate a question?

362
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:46,595
Because we swore to protect each other,
no matter what.

363
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:50,933
That was the only way
I could protect you that day.

364
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:54,270
Oh, my. Do you agree with his words?

365
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:34,518
Ho-yeong.

366
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:58,000
Something's wrong. This isn't right.

367
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:00,961
Don't kill him, please!

368
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:03,422
No!

369
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:19,563
No…

370
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:40,334
Do you agree with your friend's words?

371
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:44,254
I disagree.

372
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:49,802
Why? But your brother tried to kill you?

373
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:52,638
You pricks.

374
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,101
What makes you think
you can speak about my brother?

375
00:32:57,685 --> 00:32:59,395
-Stop it!
-This is all your fault!

376
00:33:00,938 --> 00:33:03,607
I asked you to give him a chance.

377
00:33:03,691 --> 00:33:05,693
That he must have a good reason.

378
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:08,195
But you didn't believe me.

379
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,084
This is it.

380
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:24,920
-This is what he wants from us.
-What?

381
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,339
I'm talking about this stupid show!

382
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:32,636
He intended for us to fight each other.

383
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,432
Moo-yeong, he is afraid of mountain gods.

384
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,475
Come on, I doubt it.

385
00:33:41,729 --> 00:33:43,021
You stay out of this.

386
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:49,486
Hey. You're watching me, no?

387
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:51,697
We are your inferiority complex.

388
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:54,742
We are the mountain gods
you could never become.

389
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:56,952
And the reaper's here for your neck.

390
00:33:58,287 --> 00:33:59,830
Have your will ready.

391
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:16,513
CHANGE CHANNEL

392
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,436
I'll kill you.

393
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:26,273
-Boss, cut this silk thread for me!
-You're the one who'll be killed.

394
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:29,026
-Too bad you won't get your naengmyeon.
-Shut up!

395
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,320
-Boss!
-Shut up, all of you!

396
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,535
Are you inside? It's me, Yeo-hee.

397
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:45,334
Bullshit. You think you can fool me again?

398
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,587
I made late-night snacks for you.

399
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,672
Snacks or whatnot, get lost!

400
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:01,225
Come in. I'm waiting for you.

401
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:03,352
Don't come. That voice isn't me!

402
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,355
-I told you to come in.
-Don't come in!

403
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:08,357
I'll kill you if you do!

404
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:11,777
I'm going in, okay?

405
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:17,491
I don't need you, so please just leave!

406
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:43,767
Are you okay?

407
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,371
I told you not to come in.

408
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:06,707
I promised, remember?

409
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,835
I promised I'd protect you.

410
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:16,091
I'm unnecessarily indebted to you again…

411
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:22,431
This time, repay me all at once.

412
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,435
How?

413
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:53,522
This is the thing.

414
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:59,486
I thought Jangsan Tiger had taken a peek
into my head to make this TV show.

415
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:00,570
But?

416
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:05,367
I like rom-coms, so I didn't even watch
the legendary TV show, Rustic Period.

417
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,077
What are you trying to say?

418
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:12,374
Can I trust you?

419
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:16,336
If you can't, cut me.

420
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:23,176
-You'll die a meaningless death here?
-In return, save Hong-joo at all costs.

421
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,138
My life doesn't matter one bit.

422
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:34,146
What did you want to check?

423
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:37,065
If you're the Moo-yeong I know.

424
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:42,362
So? Do you have an answer?

425
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:44,823
Yeah.

426
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:48,869
You laid down your life to save Hong-joo.

427
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:50,620
Just like the Moo-yeong I know.

428
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:53,331
Whatever I may be to you,

429
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:56,918
I don't intend to give up
on either of you.

430
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:02,466
There was one moment…

431
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:06,511
I wanted to hear those words
from you before.

432
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:26,198
There are rice puffs here too.

433
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:32,037
-Isn't this too Hansel and Gretel?
-What if Hong-joo left them?

434
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,082
Okay, let's go then.

435
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:37,626
Who cares if a witch shows up now.

436
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,039
When the wedding is over,

437
00:40:17,124 --> 00:40:20,502
you will be my bride forever.

438
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:04,504
We will perform the hapgeun ceremony
signifying the bride and groom's union.

439
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:07,507
HAPGEUN CEREMONY - CUP TRADING
RITUAL TO UNIFY A COUPLE

440
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:29,946
Drink it.

441
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:34,576
If you drink this,
you can live in your fond memories…

442
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:37,370
forever.

443
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:17,202
Hong-joo.

444
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:21,122
Hong-joo, you're safe.

445
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:23,625
-Are you not injured?
-Hey-- No, stay away!

446
00:42:28,672 --> 00:42:30,173
Wake up, Hong-joo.

447
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,592
Her eyes are blank.

448
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:37,138
We took our matrimonial vows, you see.

449
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:43,103
So it was you?

450
00:42:44,271 --> 00:42:46,022
She belongs to this world now.

451
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:49,109
She is Jangsan Tiger's bride now.

452
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:50,610
Bullshit!

453
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:58,576
Wow.

454
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:06,084
If you wish to kill me,
you will have to strike her first.

455
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:10,005
Or you can live out your life
in this damned world forever.

456
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:11,423
I'm going home.

457
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:13,967
I promised to eat naengmyeon
with my brother.

458
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:18,722
Moo-yeong, take your sword out.

459
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:22,892
Just like he said,
we must take her down to get to him.

460
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:29,524
I can't do it.

461
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:34,446
We have to. We're the only ones who can.

462
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,072
Let's leave here with her.

463
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,414
I give you my word.

464
00:44:26,498 --> 00:44:30,293
I, Lee Yeon, promise to protect you both
with this sword, no matter what.

465
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:32,337
-Just trust me.
-You idiot.

466
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,672
We protect each other.

467
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:40,178
I, Hong-joo, will soil this sword
with the blood of hundreds and thousands

468
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,180
to protect Yeon and Moo-yeong.

469
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:48,937
Well, I wish to protect the both of you
without slaying anyone or anything.

470
00:45:27,434 --> 00:45:28,435
Let's swear

471
00:45:28,518 --> 00:45:31,771
to protect each other no matter what.

472
00:45:54,461 --> 00:45:56,629
Hey, stop tormenting him.

473
00:45:58,882 --> 00:46:00,425
I can't do it.

474
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:03,052
I couldn't cut you to save my life.

475
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:17,192
I came back for you.

476
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:22,489
I'm alive because of you, Hong-joo.

477
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:34,667
Die.

478
00:46:39,923 --> 00:46:40,924
Stop this, Hong-joo.

479
00:46:42,342 --> 00:46:43,343
Please stop.

480
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:49,057
Stop this.

481
00:46:50,892 --> 00:46:52,143
And come with us.

482
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:36,062
Gosh, how pathetic.

483
00:47:37,105 --> 00:47:39,941
Do they still believe such things
will get through to her?

484
00:47:43,111 --> 00:47:44,237
End them for good.

485
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:52,287
Will I die here?

486
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:55,248
At a lousy place like this?

487
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:58,376
By the hand of a best friend at that?

488
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:02,213
I'm not afraid to die by your hand.

489
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:06,342
Even if I die…

490
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,470
you must live on, Hong-joo.

491
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:12,807
You must survive to return…

492
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:15,226
to where you belong.

493
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:34,245
This is proof that
the three of us are one.

494
00:48:42,712 --> 00:48:43,713
Hey…

495
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:48,551
Unlike Moo-yeong.
I don't intend to die by you.

496
00:48:53,723 --> 00:48:56,017
Come back, Ryu Hong-joo.

497
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,727
Come back to us.

498
00:49:00,188 --> 00:49:02,899
Geez, what the hell are they doing?

499
00:49:03,483 --> 00:49:04,484
Let's go together…

500
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:08,237
As we always have.

501
00:49:08,905 --> 00:49:10,156
The three of us together.

502
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,209
Hey.

503
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:23,961
Don't make Hong-joo cry.

504
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:28,549
Don't make Hong-joo cry!

505
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:31,094
Guys, get up!

506
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:40,728
Don't make her cry--
Don't make Hong-joo cry!

507
00:49:40,812 --> 00:49:41,813
Stop that!

508
00:49:43,773 --> 00:49:44,941
Bite me instead!

509
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:53,950
Moo-yeong!

510
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:14,095
Hong-joo, wake up.

511
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,472
Come with us, okay?

512
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,817
Kill them. Kill 'em both!

513
00:50:31,279 --> 00:50:32,739
That's right!

514
00:50:36,117 --> 00:50:37,326
Hong-joo…

515
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:54,635
What?

516
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:57,805
How could you?

517
00:51:01,309 --> 00:51:04,312
You dared to play me like a puppet?

518
00:51:09,317 --> 00:51:12,570
Damn it, you crazy bitch.

519
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:21,037
Do not insult her.

520
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:34,842
We never lose
when the three of us are together.

521
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:57,949
-You still get hurt on my behalf.
-Your safety is all that matters.

522
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:00,660
That's all I need.

523
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,454
We have no time. Let's hurry.

524
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:05,915
Wait.

525
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:23,516
Where am I? I lost my memory,
while playing the corner game.

526
00:52:25,268 --> 00:52:27,728
-Mr. Cheon!
-We'll talk after we leave this place.

527
00:52:27,812 --> 00:52:29,522
-Let's go.
-Come on.

528
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:34,193
Careful, guys.

529
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:09,604
Oh, my!

530
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:13,691
Having no cars or taxis
is driving me nuts!

531
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,905
Oh, hey! Ta-- Taxi!

532
00:53:20,615 --> 00:53:22,658
-Let's go to Myoyeongak.
-What?

533
00:53:22,742 --> 00:53:24,118
-Myoyeongak!
-Myoyeongak.

534
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,453
Departing to Myoyeongak!

535
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:27,705
-Go! To Myoyeongak!
-Go!

536
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:39,175
Excuse me, where did you get those shoes?

537
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:43,054
A young man gave it to me as a gift.

538
00:53:43,638 --> 00:53:44,722
As a gift?

539
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:48,100
He probably thinks of it as philanthropy.

540
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:55,274
Think of this as philanthropy, okay?

541
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:09,538
Hey, you know me, right?

542
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:13,709
-Wow.
-So it is you?

543
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,634
Hey! Damn you!

544
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:23,427
-Come here, you prick!
-Stay away!

545
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:31,894
You bastard!

546
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:38,025
You little thief.
Give me back my shoes and wedding ring!

547
00:54:38,109 --> 00:54:40,611
They're mine that I stole fair and square!

548
00:54:40,695 --> 00:54:42,613
You little bastard, die!

549
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:47,868
Those muscles! Boss!

550
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:50,955
Why are you looking for your boss now,
you pervert?

551
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,418
Where's the way out?

552
00:55:03,384 --> 00:55:04,385
This way.

553
00:55:16,689 --> 00:55:17,690
Come now.

554
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,041
-Go inside.
-Hurry.

555
00:55:39,128 --> 00:55:41,589
Moo-yeong? Cheon Moo-yeong!

556
00:55:42,298 --> 00:55:43,299
Moo-yeong?

557
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,718
Moo-yeong!

558
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:07,281
Where's Lee Yeon?

559
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:15,247
The door is closed.

560
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:20,211
You left him there. Why?
Why are you the only one back?

561
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:21,337
We came together!

562
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:24,507
We were all there…

563
00:56:25,508 --> 00:56:28,135
Cheon Moo-yeong. This is his doing.

564
00:56:28,636 --> 00:56:30,012
He did this on purpose.

565
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:34,558
It can't be.

566
00:57:11,387 --> 00:57:12,555
So it was you.

567
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:18,811
You were the one
who called on Jangsan Tiger.

568
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:23,315
I needed this.

569
00:57:23,399 --> 00:57:25,442
A demon's essence
of over thousands of years.

570
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:29,280
It's like medicine for my body.

571
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:57,975
At last.

572
00:58:00,269 --> 00:58:04,607
I reclaim my body at last, Lee Yeon.

573
00:58:05,191 --> 00:58:06,358
And you are Red-white mask.

574
00:58:06,442 --> 00:58:08,027
I am indeed.

575
00:58:08,694 --> 00:58:10,321
The one who threw you into this era,

576
00:58:11,155 --> 00:58:13,741
and tried to kill you
and your brother countless times.

577
00:58:14,909 --> 00:58:17,745
-That was all me.
-I was hoping otherwise.

578
00:58:20,206 --> 00:58:23,167
-That it'd be anyone but you.
-I lost everything because of you.

579
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:26,170
My family, friends, and my mountain!

580
00:58:28,214 --> 00:58:29,757
Including myself.

581
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:34,511
I hate those who blame others
after living for over a thousand years.

582
00:58:34,595 --> 00:58:37,806
Lee Yeon, you can't go home.

583
00:58:38,474 --> 00:58:41,352
You will never see
the woman you love either.

584
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:42,728
Cheon Moo-yeong.

585
00:59:00,496 --> 00:59:02,915
I will kill you, if that's your wish.

586
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:15,511
You had the wrong look from the start.
I expected you'd pull something like this.

587
00:59:15,594 --> 00:59:16,679
Rang.

588
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,058
I told you not to trust him.

589
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:23,727
I'm okay, but you're in danger.
Get out of here.

590
00:59:26,522 --> 00:59:29,024
Lay a finger on him, and I'll kill you.

591
00:59:29,108 --> 00:59:30,985
What harm can a half-fox do?

592
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:34,196
If you want to kill him, kill me first.

593
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:37,366
Don't you lay a finger
on my little brother.

594
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:43,789
After butchering my brother to pieces,
you sure do play the sibling act, huh?

595
00:59:56,135 --> 00:59:58,053
Let me tell you a funny story.

596
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:00,222
You…

597
01:00:06,687 --> 01:00:09,148
Why did Moo-yeong leave
without killing me?

598
01:00:10,482 --> 01:00:11,984
It was his golden opportunity.

599
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:16,238
What did he tell you?

600
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:19,199
Gibberish.

601
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:22,328
Let's go. Buy me naengmyeon.

602
01:00:25,372 --> 01:00:28,000
Hey, did you come running here
because you were worried?

603
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,336
Sheesh. Don't be ridiculous.

604
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:33,464
Goodness, my brother sure is the best.

605
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:35,549
Stop that. You're heavy.

606
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:38,552
Can't you walk straight?

607
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,679
Geez. Look at the state of you.

608
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:09,166
About Jangsan Tiger…

609
01:01:11,752 --> 01:01:12,961
I called him on.

610
01:01:13,545 --> 01:01:17,674
I had no idea he'd target you.
I'm sorry, Hong-joo.

611
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:21,261
I wasn't asking for a confession.

612
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:23,722
You get what you want?

613
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:29,645
-What's your plan now?
-I intend to revive my brother.

614
01:01:31,772 --> 01:01:32,940
Your dead brother?

615
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:38,028
No matter what you say,
Lee Yeon and I will fight to the death.

616
01:01:40,072 --> 01:01:41,073
Then, give it up.

617
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:45,577
Act all you want,
but you don't make a good villain.

618
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,627
Can't you just stay by my side?

619
01:01:54,253 --> 01:01:56,380
-As my precious friend?
-Hong-joo.

620
01:02:00,175 --> 01:02:01,718
I don't care if he does it.

621
01:02:03,429 --> 01:02:04,847
But don't you try to sway me.

622
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:08,225
If you try to sway me…

623
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:23,991
-Damn it. My side is narrower!
-What are you on about? My side's wider.

624
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:26,410
What the hell are you saying?
Just shut up.

625
01:02:28,704 --> 01:02:31,790
Hey, Jae-yoo!
You must be coming from some place far?

626
01:02:31,874 --> 01:02:33,500
What are you doing in my room?

627
01:02:33,584 --> 01:02:37,671
Now it's our room.
The higher-ups gave permission.

628
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,381
-Who do you mean?
-Madame Ryu.

629
01:02:39,965 --> 01:02:42,718
Geez. Lord Lee Yeon kicked me out,
because of my snoring.

630
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:47,097
-Hey, you even snore?
-Did I not tell you not to cross the line?

631
01:02:47,181 --> 01:02:49,766
Seriously! Look how petty this man is.

632
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:52,478
Jae-yoo.
Mind your stuff. This prick's a thief.

633
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:55,898
Hey, you bastard. I'm proud of my job!

634
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:58,650
-You'd be dead if not for Lord Lee Rang!
-Both of you!

635
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:02,821
I don't mind you guys fighting,
but please don't speak to me.

636
01:03:04,448 --> 01:03:06,825
What? Well, he's a sassy punk.

637
01:03:08,327 --> 01:03:09,953
What's your MBTI?

638
01:03:10,037 --> 01:03:11,538
-What?
-What's an em-bi-tae?

639
01:03:11,622 --> 01:03:12,873
MBTI.

640
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:14,833
Is it Japanese?

641
01:03:15,918 --> 01:03:19,588
-Man, I'm dying!
-Oh, you mean Mandarin.

642
01:03:21,006 --> 01:03:23,425
-Please save us!
-Is no one there?

643
01:03:24,051 --> 01:03:25,761
Honey, where on earth is this?

644
01:03:25,844 --> 01:03:29,223
-What crime did we even commit?
-Someone's coming!

645
01:03:31,725 --> 01:03:33,936
How many demons did we secure?

646
01:03:34,603 --> 01:03:37,189
We have a decent number,
but they are all weaklings.

647
01:03:37,272 --> 01:03:40,526
We must complete the experiment
to send them off to war.

648
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:42,611
Increase the number of captures.

649
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:50,202
And secure the stronger ones.

650
01:03:51,245 --> 01:03:53,539
Joseon demons are more cunning
than expected.

651
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:56,583
They know where to hide on their turf.

652
01:04:00,254 --> 01:04:01,880
The Shinigami Mercenaries.

653
01:04:04,633 --> 01:04:05,884
Summon them.

654
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:09,429
The Shinigami Mercenaries?

655
01:04:10,597 --> 01:04:14,309
They are the best in the field,
but they're uncontrollable.

656
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:18,063
I will do the controlling.

657
01:04:22,693 --> 01:04:23,694
But, sir!

658
01:04:25,821 --> 01:04:27,781
Experiment? What are they talking about?

659
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:31,743
Honey, I don't like this.
We have to get out of here!

660
01:04:33,912 --> 01:04:36,665
-Save us!
-Please save us, please!

661
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:47,676
I won't forgive you, Cheon Moo-yeong.

662
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:17,039
Let me tell you a funny story.

663
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:18,915
You…

664
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:22,002
will die before you live a century.

665
01:05:22,794 --> 01:05:27,633
In the year 2020, you sacrifice yourself
on your brother's behalf.

666
01:05:30,886 --> 01:05:33,972
You will only die
after being used your whole life.

667
01:05:49,655 --> 01:05:54,368
TALE OF THE NINE TAILED

668
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:20,686
Search the Gyeongseong grounds,

669
01:06:20,769 --> 01:06:22,729
and find out who's behind this.

670
01:06:22,813 --> 01:06:24,773
Your brother must be quite busy now.

671
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:26,608
Why risk your life on a stupid bet?

672
01:06:26,692 --> 01:06:29,444
I, too, wanted to live.

673
01:06:29,528 --> 01:06:32,698
If I win, revert his life span.

674
01:06:33,323 --> 01:06:36,034
We must uproot the spirit of Joseon.

675
01:06:36,535 --> 01:06:37,828
This isn't going to work.

676
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:39,538
We're on the same side, no?

677
01:06:39,621 --> 01:06:40,789
I'll help you.

678
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:43,375
I wonder how many of them
will make it out alive?

679
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:45,877
It will be a bloody night.

680
01:06:47,379 --> 01:06:50,382
