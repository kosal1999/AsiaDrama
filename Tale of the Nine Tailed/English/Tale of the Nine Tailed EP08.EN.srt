1
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:56,974
TALE OF THE NINE TAILED

2
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,234
Emergency! Wake up!

3
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:09,195
-It's an emergency! Wake up!
-Ax!

4
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:15,242
-Is it an ambush?
-Madame Ryu's summons.

5
00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:17,453
I don't know why, but she's gone wild.

6
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:21,499
EPISODE 8

7
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,125
What? Why?

8
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,841
The cabbage from the seas
are firm and hearty.

9
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:34,678
-Taste all good with the shrimps?
-It's refreshing, without a fishy smell.

10
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,890
-Please save me, boss.
-What are you doing there?

11
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:40,267
I thought there was an emergency?

12
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:43,813
One of Myoyeongak's biggest events
is obviously an emergency.

13
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:46,440
-Sit down, the three of you.
-It's gimjang season?

14
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:49,819
-I'm a former mountain god.
-I'm the boss of a bandit gang.

15
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:52,321
I'm a victim of the bandit gang.

16
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:55,658
-A former god never makes kimchi. Geez.
-Hold on.

17
00:01:57,368 --> 00:02:00,788
I've calculated your lodging expenses.
You've been indulging free of charge.

18
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:04,542
It sums up to
at least the cost of a house!

19
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:09,171
-How is it so expen--
-I told you not to eat full course meals!

20
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:10,381
You ate most of it!

21
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:13,259
Oh, well…

22
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,846
Don't I get a discount?
We're friends and I'm a former god, no?

23
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:19,265
Not a chance, you punk.

24
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:21,851
Geez,
it's not like I've ever done this before.

25
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:23,435
Seriously.

26
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:26,730
Gosh, my back.

27
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:31,527
Do we really need to make
500 cabbage heads worth of kimchi?

28
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,489
I'm a bandit, but I have red pepper
instead of blood on my hands.

29
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:37,449
-Well, I'll say!
-Kimchi tastes best homemade.

30
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:38,826
Make sure to fill it up.

31
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:43,539
-Hey, but isn't this a bit too salty?
-Really? Let me try.

32
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:52,631
It's just right. It should be salty
to ferment it in a crock.

33
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:54,300
-Is that so?
-Be meticulous.

34
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,260
-It should be salty.
-It's delicious!

35
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:25,873
Hey, you two!

36
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,042
Gosh, seriously.

37
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:33,047
Sir, I can't share rooms with him.
We're so incompatible.

38
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,465
Gosh, you're gonna rat me out?

39
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:38,344
So why did you rob him of all people?
He can be really vindictive, you know.

40
00:03:38,928 --> 00:03:42,222
How could he have known?
Just commend him for his professionalism.

41
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:47,645
Exactly. Who's the idiot taking drinks
without knowing what's in it?

42
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,938
You thief.

43
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:55,903
Hey,
blaming the victim is still uncalled for!

44
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,656
-Don't yell at my henchman!
-Don't talk back to your brother!

45
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,824
Don't tell my boss what to do!

46
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,701
-Shut up and kimjang!
-Get your hands--

47
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,344
Even Gyeongseong's changed quite a bit.

48
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,429
Speak in Korean, you idiot.

49
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,976
K-- Korean. H-- Hard.

50
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,478
It's been twenty years
since you've learned Korean.

51
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,650
You guys the Shinigami Mercenaries?

52
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:39,738
-I'm on orders to pick you up.
-You work for Kato, but you don't know us?

53
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:44,284
This is Gyeongseong.
I don't care about you hillbillies.

54
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,955
Shall we tell you who we are?

55
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:54,336
There are many eyes watching.

56
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:24,575
-Are you waiting for Lee Rang?
-No, ma'am.

57
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,536
If not, what's all this?

58
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:33,500
Magazines say folding paper cranes
will make your love come true.

59
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:36,295
Goodness. You like him that much?

60
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:42,301
-Go meet him then.
-Can I do that?

61
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,887
Then I'll be back in an hour.

62
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:48,640
My gosh.

63
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:53,562
Damn! There's caramel on my clothes.

64
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:57,900
-Nyudo. You did this, huh?
-So noisy…

65
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,985
Disgusting! Give me my clothes!

66
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,207
-What are you looking at?
-I wasn't looking.

67
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,209
Yes, you were. Just now.

68
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:33,185
Oh, goodness. Finally, we have some space.

69
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,983
-It's a demon. There's a demon here.
-What kind?

70
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:48,534
-A mermaid.
-Doesn't mermaid flesh grant immortality?

71
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,494
I want to eat it.

72
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,247
Yuki, I'll catch it for you.

73
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,750
That's enough.
The mission comes first for now.

74
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,685
Yum! It's so delicious.

75
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,771
You look free.
Aren't you going to catch Red-white mask?

76
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,107
I already went looking for him,
but he's gone.

77
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:24,319
-Want my guys to look for him?
-No. He'll come on his own.

78
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,993
You will die before you live a century.

79
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:36,165
In the year 2020, you sacrifice yourself
on your brother's behalf.

80
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,960
How are things with the mermaid?
Is it going well?

81
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,087
-I hear you see her daily.
-Not daily.

82
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:44,798
Let's set a date for us to meet.
Where should we meet?

83
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,968
Korean cuisine or Western cuisine?
Seafood's off the table, right?

84
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:52,055
-The bride is a similar species after all.
-Are you crazy? Engagement, my foot.

85
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:56,852
-My wish is to see you get married.
-That's none of your business.

86
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,690
Hey! Why are you drinking makgeolli
on an empty stomach, huh?

87
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,902
-Here. Have some suyuk too.
-Seriously, cut it out.

88
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,115
-Is this so upsetting to you, huh?
-Stop being nice. It's annoying.

89
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:16,163
What's the problem this time, huh?
Why are you being perverse?

90
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,167
Hey!

91
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,503
Geez, that little…

92
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:28,800
Gosh, that brat.
We haven't even much time left together.

93
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:04,980
Akira!

94
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,444
Didn't you want to see Yuki?

95
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:15,198
-I'm not so sure.
-Yuki missed Akira so, so much.

96
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,576
I heard you got bitch-slapped
by Joseon demons.

97
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,245
Don't laugh!

98
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,790
I'll get you your revenge.

99
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,376
Just do as you're told.

100
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,213
Don't give Yuki orders!

101
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:35,218
Akira, you sure look dapper now
since quitting the group?

102
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,389
Is it 'cause it's a white-collar job?

103
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:40,974
Don't touch me.

104
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,227
You came.

105
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:54,237
Shinigami Mercenaries.
Arriving from Manchuria.

106
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:57,574
Everyone,
thank you for your efforts in battle.

107
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:02,162
-Where's your boss?
-You haven't seen him?

108
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,666
-He left for Gyeongseong before us.
-Boss only shows up when he feels like it.

109
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:11,213
Just tell us the mission.
I might lose my mind from impatience.

110
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:14,883
-We're conducting an experiment.
-An experiment?

111
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:18,720
To convert Joseon demons
into the Empire's war weapons.

112
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:21,515
Oh, my. That sounds like so much fun.

113
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,267
Your mission is
to capture the Joseon demons.

114
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:28,772
Can I kill them
and bring back only a body part?

115
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:34,277
It'll be difficult to capture them alive.

116
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,781
And how will you be paying?

117
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:40,659
By the number of heads.

118
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:42,786
Yes, sir!

119
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,380
Was it a good idea to call them?

120
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:56,007
-They move arbitrarily.
-The experiments aren't everything.

121
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,011
We must wipe them out.

122
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:05,517
Uproot the Joseon demons,
and their folk beliefs.

123
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,813
We must uproot the spirit of Joseon.

124
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:15,193
-I looked into the one named Lee Yeon.
-And?

125
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,028
He's at Myoyeongak.

126
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:20,782
Just like the Madame,
he's also a mountain god of Joseon.

127
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:25,996
A mountain god of Joseon, you say.

128
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:39,217
CHEON HO-YEONG

129
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:41,303
It was a long wait.

130
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:23,553
-Old man.
-Yeah.

131
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:32,229
-How did you find me?
-You weren't home, so…

132
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:39,236
-Isn't your brother buried here?
-Yes, he used to be.

133
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,031
But he's there now.

134
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:51,206
Moo-yeong,
what on earth are you trying to do?

135
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:57,045
I'm boiling his bones with dirt.
Plus, a weasel, snake, and spider.

136
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:58,630
Don't tell me…

137
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,551
Do you intend to work the banhon charm?
No, you can't. You mustn't wreck…

138
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,219
BANHON CHARM -
CHARM THAT REVIVES THE DEAD

139
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:09,182
-…the realm of the Living and the Dead.
-I know. I may never be forgiven for it.

140
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:13,270
-But I have to do it.
-Don't turn the old hag into your enemy.

141
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,982
Neither she nor I…
We haven't given up on you.

142
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,735
This is why I didn't want to see you.

143
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,615
You kept my company
even when I became stone.

144
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:30,453
When it was snowing, you'd put clothes
on an immobile piece of stone.

145
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,754
You were always sensitive to the cold.

146
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:45,343
I'm no longer the Moo-yeong you knew.
No. I must not be.

147
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:51,141
Moo-yeong, you think I don't know you?

148
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,186
Just let me be the villain.

149
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,940
Don't come looking for me anymore.

150
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,950
I bought this for you.

151
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,206
Don't skip meals.

152
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:55,163
-When are you leaving?
-I have less than a week left.

153
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,044
-Do you have to go?
-Yes, I do.

154
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,296
I have someone waiting.

155
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,674
Geez, you jerk.

156
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,885
I heard she was reincarnated? That woman.

157
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,554
Moo-yeong tell you that?

158
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:17,852
Why didn't you say anything
about Moo-yeong's identity?

159
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:19,562
You knew, didn't you?

160
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,817
Perhaps, I hoped to dream.

161
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:29,072
That maybe
we could return to the old days.

162
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,827
Just a silly dream that only I have.

163
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:38,623
I don't know if you'll believe me,
but I never abandoned either of you.

164
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,752
That's why I can't forgive him.

165
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,214
I'll end this with my own hands.

166
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:48,925
You're just like him.

167
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,886
You both risk your lives to save me…

168
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,223
yet steal each other from me again.

169
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,725
I'm sorry, Hong-joo.

170
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,769
For never giving you
the answer you wanted.

171
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:03,148
But I have something to protect.

172
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:07,444
Both here, and the future where I'm from.

173
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:12,699
Fine, then.
If that's how you guys want to be.

174
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:18,371
I quit being
the pathetic damsel in distress.

175
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,835
I, too, will do whatever it takes
to protect Myoyeongak and my girls.

176
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:27,464
You left one out.

177
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:32,427
You. Be sure to protect yourself too.

178
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:35,972
I want a hug.

179
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,145
I won't play fair from now.

180
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:54,199
SAFETY AND SECURITY
SAY NO TO WAR

181
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:04,375
Wait! Hold on!

182
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:09,255
I mean, this isn't a barbershop.
It's useless if we do this ourselves.

183
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:11,925
We must get Taluipa to come out!
The Talui-- Hey, hey!

184
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,094
-You should be fasting right now.
-Geez.

185
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:16,721
-Hey!
-This is why-- Oh, gosh.

186
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,557
Oh, my.

187
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:22,185
Now you decide to show your face?

188
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:26,731
I'm here to watch
the sedentary deity shave his head.

189
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,858
SEDENTARY DEITY - A
HOUSE-PROTECTING TUTELARY DEITY

190
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,194
Well, I don't know.

191
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:35,907
If I bid farewell to my hair,
I expect it'll make things tougher on you.

192
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,827
Go for it. You have a nice shaped head.

193
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,996
-Should I cut it--
-Gosh! Hold on! Geez.

194
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,999
Let me knock some sense into you.

195
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:49,963
Wait, wait-- Hold on!
Let's talk! We'll settle this with words.

196
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,090
You might die if you keep this up!

197
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:56,094
Whose side are you on?

198
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,515
The indigenous gods
have been disappearing for no reason.

199
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:04,686
-We don't have a place to live right now.
-So?

200
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:07,188
What? You want me to buy you a house?

201
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:12,360
Oh, honey.
It's a matter of their survival.

202
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:15,780
Our job is to oversee life and death,
not to look after these pricks!

203
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:19,492
You see this? I knew this would happen!

204
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,328
If this problem remains unresolved,

205
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:27,000
know that all the provincial gods
will gather here to go on strike!

206
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,837
-Destroy him first!
-Oh, no.

207
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:35,717
Come on, honey. Don't be like that.
Let's help them out however we can.

208
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:45,059
Honey, drag all those pricks out of here.

209
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,563
And do as I say.

210
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,486
It's a demon. There's a disguised demon.

211
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,032
It's original form?

212
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:02,201
One is an eagle-owl,
and the other is a nine-tailed fox.

213
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:05,622
Hey, hey! He's super cute!

214
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:09,709
That man! To think such
a beautiful demon was in Joseon.

215
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,630
-Don't touch him. I'll take care of it.
-Yuki!

216
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:16,925
-Gosh, what!
-You can't.

217
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:21,971
Here.

218
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,812
Gosh, you sure are a fox.

219
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:33,024
What are you, a girl?
Slapping all that on your face.

220
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:36,277
Says the guy slapping oil on his sheets.
Want to fight again?

221
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:37,445
You little--

222
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:40,365
Both of you. Let's talk for a minute.

223
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:44,410
We're sharing rooms
due to inevitable circumstances,

224
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:46,621
but communal life entails responsibility.

225
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:49,165
I can't sleep because of you two fighting!

226
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:53,461
-Just last night--
-This thief used my chamber pot.

227
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:56,631
We shared some potty pan,
so what's the big deal? Geez.

228
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,885
You should at least not poop
in someone else's chamber pot!

229
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:04,639
-Why not?
-Let me tell you the rules of this room.

230
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:06,849
First, don't fight after 9 p.m.

231
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:11,145
Second, live a regular lifestyle.
We wake up at six in the morning.

232
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:15,984
-What? Is this the military?
-Third, take turns cleaning once a day.

233
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:21,239
-Be sure to hang your sheets in the sun.
-Gosh, you sure do nag a lot.

234
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:25,410
May I ask what you are
behind your disguise?

235
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:26,953
I'm a Jindo.

236
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,373
Natural monument no. 53.

237
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:34,752
THE JINDO WAS DESIGNATED
AS A NATURAL MONUMENT IN 1938

238
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:35,837
Paw.

239
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:41,801
Don't do that!

240
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:45,138
We're an endangered species too, you know.

241
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:47,098
Bang!

242
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:50,351
Usually, dogs play dead if I do this.

243
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:51,978
-Bang!
-Bang!

244
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:54,856
Do you two…

245
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:56,983
wish to go extinct?

246
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,318
Water. Water!

247
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:02,822
Eat up.

248
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:06,576
Gosh, seriously.

249
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:11,247
You want us to resolve
all those civil complaints? Why?

250
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,667
You have no choice. You refuse, you
can't go home and you're going to hell.

251
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,962
-Seriously, this old hag--
-I get him, but why me?

252
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:20,965
She commuted your jail sentence
for killing that salt merchant, no?

253
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:23,843
-I knew it.
-I actually bribed her for that. One cow!

254
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:27,764
Whatever, I don't know!
Anyway, I'm leaving her to you.

255
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:30,058
-Old man, how can you leave like this?
-Old man!

256
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:31,142
Gosh.

257
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:34,103
Whatever, you take care of it.
It's your house.

258
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:36,564
Let's do it together. Sheesh!

259
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,317
Stop eating!

260
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:46,199
No cutting in line!

261
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,540
Hey, stand in line!

262
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:56,375
Hey!

263
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:00,755
Attention, everyone.

264
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:05,510
We made kimchi today, so we're exhausted.
I'd like to avoid violence, if possible.

265
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:07,970
-So let's keep this neat.
-Come in one at a time.

266
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:11,099
Make your story short and brief.
Within a 20 word count.

267
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:14,310
-Who are you and where are you from?
-I own the well by that intersection.

268
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,145
A well god? What brings you here?

269
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:18,231
WELL GOD - AN INDIGENOUS GOD
WHO STOPS WELLS FROM DRYING OUT

270
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:19,607
My well produces medicinal water.

271
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,026
People all the way from Incheon
to draw water from it.

272
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,611
But they say it tastes different now.

273
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:26,239
You think we're here
to replace your water purifier filters?

274
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:30,118
-What's a water purifier?
-You want to clean the well or move out?

275
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:31,869
Gosh, I can't use that well anymore.

276
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:35,957
Someone put chemicals in the water,
so I need a new place to nest.

277
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:39,377
Then, find her an unclaimed well
and let her nest there.

278
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,628
Next!

279
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:43,756
I'm the crock god,
and my crock jar was stolen.

280
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,510
I don't know who did it, but I hear
they were dressed like Japanese soldiers.

281
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,804
Maybe they were stolen
because the crock god left his post.

282
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,597
CROCK GOD - AN INDIGENOUS GOD
WHO PROTECTS CROCK JARS

283
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:53,683
-You're right.
-Why did you go wandering around?

284
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:57,061
I gained some weight
so the jar felt a little tight.

285
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:58,855
-Buy him one.
-Yes, ma'am.

286
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:02,900
Well, might as well buy me
quality earthen pots from Yeoju--

287
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:04,777
Get out of here!

288
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:07,113
Who are you?

289
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:12,785
Oh, dear.

290
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:15,538
Why? What is it?

291
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:16,914
She's the ancestral god.

292
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:19,458
Her landlord doesn't hold ancestral rites,
so she's famished.

293
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:20,543
ANCESTRAL GOD -
A GOD WHO PROTECTS

294
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:21,627
ONE'S DESCENDANTS

295
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:24,380
-Is that something to whisper about?
-She's a bit shy.

296
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:28,301
-So what does she want?
-She wishes to demolish her house.

297
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:33,222
This is the problem with tutelary deities.
You guys don't own the house, okay?

298
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:36,058
You share it with the descendants.
Like "home sharing."

299
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:39,395
Feed her ritual leftovers
and send her off.

300
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:40,897
Next.

301
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:44,525
He's the Great General of all Under Heaven
placed below Bukhansan.

302
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:47,653
But the Female General of the Underworld,
has gone missing.

303
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:49,488
-Oh, dear.
-You hit the boredom rut.

304
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:50,573
Next!

305
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,454
-I'm home.
-Where have you been off to lately?

306
00:24:57,914 --> 00:25:00,249
Maybe my dad's forgotten,
but I'm a journalist.

307
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:03,794
A reporter at my newspaper company.

308
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,298
And your boss is telling you to sit down.

309
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:15,598
I'm not hungry.

310
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:18,768
Your dad's worried you've lost weight.

311
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:22,480
The daughter of Gyeongseong's richest man
looking like barley hump

312
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:25,024
will have me become a laughingstock.

313
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:29,153
-Ginko is just busy.
-What do you know about me?

314
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:34,700
Why you brat. How rude!
He's even brought you a present.

315
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,036
What for?

316
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:44,752
Look at it alone.

317
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,515
Since I've already been robbed,
let's just fund our war chest.

318
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:00,017
Why does the Chief Commissioner have this?

319
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:03,104
I'm sure I gave it to a member
of the organization.

320
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,357
Well? Do you like it?

321
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:08,901
What kind of present is it?

322
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,783
-Why are you giving this to me?
-We're family.

323
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:20,413
I'm always keeping an eye on you, Ginko.

324
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:26,002
What can you even do with this?

325
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,629
You need my family background, no?

326
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:31,173
You are where you are thanks to that.

327
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:45,730
CLUB PARADISE

328
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:11,714
Thank goodness.

329
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,051
Your heart is beating,
and you're breathing just fine.

330
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:17,845
You're alive, my brother.

331
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:35,404
Please hang in there until I get back.

332
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,867
I will never give up on you.

333
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:43,287
Stay with me for the next month.

334
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:45,247
Then take me, not Cheon Moo-yeong.

335
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:49,085
I can go with anyone, but you!
How could I send you to your death!

336
00:27:49,794 --> 00:27:51,837
I had a rough idea.

337
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:54,507
Because during our time together…

338
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:57,343
he was getting ready to leave.

339
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,470
Eat. You should gain some weight.

340
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:01,222
Do I have to tuck you in?

341
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:04,558
But…

342
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:09,146
He did all that out of guilt.

343
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:11,315
I will…

344
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:16,237
die because of Lee Yeon.

345
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,633
Now that I think about it…

346
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:23,095
I have nowhere to return to.

347
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:58,714
I still have more songs to sing.

348
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:04,220
I don't need this.

349
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:11,060
-Did something bad happen?
-Don't follow me for pity's sake.

350
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:15,272
Who is it? Who upset you?
Tell me and I'll take care of it.

351
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:18,317
-Rang--
-Stop it!

352
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,323
Are you mad at me?

353
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:27,493
Or do you need someone to vent to?

354
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,620
Yes, I'm upset because of you.

355
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:32,248
What did I do wrong?

356
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:37,628
After being abandoned by my parents
and my brother,

357
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:40,005
I wandered alone for hundreds of years.

358
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:43,175
I…

359
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:48,305
I'm just a stain in their lives.

360
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,599
I was pissed, I started killing humans.

361
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,477
I became a bandit
to loot and set fire to things.

362
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:55,563
That was my normal.

363
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,441
But…

364
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:02,695
But what?

365
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:06,699
You. All of you.

366
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:11,078
You all keep making me weak.
It's annoying.

367
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:18,752
I keep feeling tickles over here.

368
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:24,883
The world wasn't so bad to live in.

369
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:31,015
It was warm. Even to someone like me.

370
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:37,187
I hate feeling such pathetic feelings.

371
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:43,277
So? What's your conclusion?

372
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:45,029
I…

373
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:48,324
I don't need anyone anymore.

374
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:54,079
Neither you nor Lee Yeon.

375
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:56,749
Or the bandit gang.

376
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:03,422
You coward.

377
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:13,682
-What?
-Neglecting is always the easiest.

378
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:16,268
Breaking up and forgetting,
all on your own.

379
00:32:16,352 --> 00:32:18,646
Stop using the world's easiest shield.

380
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:20,898
Face your fears
like the boss of a bandit gang!

381
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:24,193
What the hell do you know?
Who do you think you are?

382
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:27,112
I'm not unimportant,
and I'm not being careless.

383
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,241
We kissed.

384
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:37,373
And I'm going to marry you.

385
00:32:45,673 --> 00:32:49,760
So you can't run away anymore.

386
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:13,117
Everyone, we're calling it a day.
Come tomorrow if you haven't had your say!

387
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,660
-What?
-Huh?

388
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:18,747
-But isn't it a bit strange?
-What is?

389
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:21,667
I think someone's
after the tutelary deities.

390
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:25,212
So many of them suddenly disappeared.

391
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:30,426
I ordered Jae-yoo to look into something.

392
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:35,097
-You know that raccoon couple?
-Damn, how could I not?

393
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,516
They recently got kidnapped in an alley.

394
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:42,521
Kidnapped? By whom?

395
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:47,276
Orders from the Governor-General.
Chief Commissioner, Ryuhei Kato.

396
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:49,903
He's running some experiment.

397
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:56,076
Kato. Where have I heard that name?

398
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:02,332
My name is Ryuhei Kato.
Remember it. We'll meet again.

399
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:06,253
It's that guy!

400
00:34:09,465 --> 00:34:11,508
Shall I destroy it?
The Governor-General of Korea.

401
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:15,262
If you kill them, what happens then?

402
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:19,475
A new Governor.
A new Chief Commissioner will come.

403
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,018
I'll fight them too!

404
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:27,399
Who will?
You have less than a week left, no?

405
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:32,863
Don't forget that you're merely
an uninvited guest in this era.

406
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:44,208
Can I just put these on?

407
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:46,585
I'll deduct it from my salary.

408
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:51,340
Were you always this rough-spoken?

409
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:56,261
Don't stop me.
I'll be Mrs. Bandit Gang soon.

410
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:02,893
Don't marry me.

411
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:07,606
-Why not?
-If I die, you'll be left alone.

412
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:10,984
You're not going to.
I'll fight the Grim Reaper.

413
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:13,987
How reassuring.

414
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,618
OBOK BOUTIQUE

415
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:25,666
Where should we go for our honeymoon?
The mountain or the sea?

416
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,543
Shall we go to both?

417
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:34,007
Let's go to Mt. Geumgang first.

418
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:38,846
They say not to discuss scenery
without seeing Mt. Geumgang.

419
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:41,849
After that, let's go to the East Sea.

420
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:46,520
You will die before you live a century.

421
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,899
In the year 2020, you sacrifice yourself
on your brother's behalf.

422
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:48,749
You smell the blood, huh?

423
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,001
Don't rush me.

424
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:55,505
Once I finish this,
I'll get you some food.

425
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,750
-Wait! Move.
-Let go!

426
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:35,921
Move, you bastard!

427
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:52,813
Wh-- Darn it.

428
00:37:55,357 --> 00:37:56,858
Gosh, that's refreshing.

429
00:38:02,823 --> 00:38:03,824
Hey--

430
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:06,660
Hey!

431
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,290
Move!

432
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,584
That prick!

433
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:17,963
Man, that felt good.

434
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,195
Gosh, my shoulder.

435
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:47,284
Is it from making kimchi?

436
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:58,837
-You too?
-The clams we had for dinner

437
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,172
must've been spoiled.

438
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:22,819
Will this help with the smell?

439
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,537
-Just this once.
-All right, let's go.

440
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:35,040
-Let's go.
-If you win this one…

441
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:36,124
That's right.

442
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,922
Come on in, come on.

443
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:52,182
There it comes!

444
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:58,146
Want to play a game?

445
00:39:58,688 --> 00:39:59,815
I'll pass.

446
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,362
How much is on the line?

447
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:07,239
They're not playing for money.

448
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:10,700
This is the Dokgakgwi's game, after all.

449
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:15,455
That man is the Dokgakgwi?

450
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:17,999
If not money, then what?

451
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:19,960
DOKGAKGWI -
AN ANCIENT WORD FOR GOBLIN

452
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:21,086
Life span.

453
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:37,435
Go Dokgakgwi! Go Dokgakgwi!

454
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:43,150
I heard Jae-yoo fell into the the toilet.

455
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:48,071
Serves him right for being a germophobe.

456
00:40:48,155 --> 00:40:49,698
You sit, and make some poo tteok.

457
00:40:52,868 --> 00:40:54,119
What's a poo tteok?

458
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:56,621
POO TTEOK - WARDS OFF MISFORTUNE
WHEN SOMEONE FALLS IN THE TOILET

459
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:59,416
It blocks off misfortune.
Even great shamans

460
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:01,418
can't treat illnesses
from falling in toilets.

461
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:04,004
Try-- Try this.

462
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:05,714
Eat as many as your age.

463
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:09,968
Man, it stinks.

464
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:12,888
He's not just a dog anymore.
He's a poop dog now.

465
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:24,733
Please don't tell Madame Ryu. I beg you.

466
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:28,862
Hang tight.

467
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:33,783
It may not seem like it,
but I'm known for being tight-lipped.

468
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,454
He fell in the toilet? How?

469
00:41:38,038 --> 00:41:41,583
According to him,
someone pulled him down from below.

470
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,335
He's too ashamed to tell the truth.

471
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:47,172
The point is, he's stinking up the room.
So if you will grant us another room--

472
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:48,965
You.

473
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:51,301
Shut up and take the lead.

474
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:04,022
-Close it.
-Close it? Okay.

475
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:15,200
-My goodness!
-Open it.

476
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:18,745
I'm scared. Do I open-- I'll open it.

477
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:25,168
-Don't come in!
-Yeah, I won't.

478
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:30,715
-Oh, geez!
-What?

479
00:42:35,095 --> 00:42:36,096
What's this?

480
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:40,600
What's what?
It's filth straight from the toilet.

481
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:43,186
Get hit, you get jinxed.

482
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,989
Quite the temper, huh?

483
00:42:57,826 --> 00:43:01,162
-You're the toilet god, aren't you?
-A toilet god?

484
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:05,250
They say evil mistresses
become toilet gods after they die.

485
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:06,876
So it's true.

486
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:11,464
-What the hell are you doing?
-Just let her be.

487
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:14,426
She'll only be satisfied
when she finishes counting your hair.

488
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:18,138
Damn it.
I lost count because of you, wench!

489
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:22,183
Wench?

490
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:25,645
All right, let's get started.

491
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:27,731
Let's see, let's see.

492
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:32,527
LEE RANG - 82 YEARS OF LIFE SPAN

493
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,280
DOKGAKGWI - 963 YEARS
OF LIFE SPAN

494
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:36,990
-I can't watch this.
-Seriously.

495
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:47,834
-There it is, there!
-You poor boy.

496
00:43:48,335 --> 00:43:49,461
All right.

497
00:43:50,337 --> 00:43:51,838
I bet 50 years.

498
00:43:56,051 --> 00:43:58,053
-Call. Show me your hand.
-Yours first.

499
00:44:00,764 --> 00:44:01,765
Pair of threes.

500
00:44:04,059 --> 00:44:06,644
-He got pair of fives!
-I win!

501
00:44:06,728 --> 00:44:08,188
Dokgakgwi wins!

502
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:10,607
As expected of Lord Dokgakgwi!

503
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:12,942
Give me your 50 years.

504
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,579
-One more game.
-Wait.

505
00:44:25,914 --> 00:44:27,457
Oh, it's heavy. Here, sir.

506
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,875
Let me have my night snack.

507
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:33,963
Memilmuk, my love.

508
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,969
Oh, wow! Give me a bite.

509
00:44:42,055 --> 00:44:43,139
It's mine!

510
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:46,643
-A lump!
-He has a lump.

511
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:48,395
He got a lump!

512
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:56,194
Next round.

513
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:58,613
All right, fine.

514
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:05,703
Here we go.

515
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:21,386
What are you doing in my house?

516
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:24,722
When I arrived,
I didn't see any house deities here so…

517
00:45:24,806 --> 00:45:27,392
So you were planning
to nest in our toilet?

518
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:29,477
Why did you pull Jae-yoo in?

519
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:33,940
He brought me flowers at night.

520
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:36,776
It'd been ages,
since I'd gotten flowers from a man.

521
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:39,446
So I wanted to spend eternity with him.

522
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,323
I support this love.

523
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:44,868
-Cut the nonsense. Get lost!
-Yes, ma'am.

524
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:49,414
You too!

525
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:52,709
Wait! Will you allow me to nest in here?

526
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:56,379
Don't try to play me.
I hate tutelary deities.

527
00:45:56,463 --> 00:46:00,925
You bless, you curse.
I know how fickle you all are. Just go.

528
00:46:01,009 --> 00:46:02,552
Wait!

529
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:06,931
If you let me nest here,
I'll tell you about the treasure.

530
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:10,393
The treasure?

531
00:46:12,187 --> 00:46:15,315
I heard it from the house deities
of the gold mining royalties.

532
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:19,694
That the Baekdudaegan mountains god
has the guardian stone and golden ruler.

533
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,534
What?

534
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:29,871
Boss' brother! We have bad news!

535
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:31,873
What is it again?

536
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:34,000
Boss is on a betting gamble!

537
00:46:35,168 --> 00:46:36,503
Man, he's addicted.

538
00:46:36,586 --> 00:46:39,464
-How much has he lost?
-It isn't money. That's not it.

539
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:41,716
Over here, here.

540
00:46:43,885 --> 00:46:44,886
Hey.

541
00:46:46,763 --> 00:46:47,972
What happened?

542
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:50,767
It's my remaining life span.

543
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:53,186
I've less than a day to live.

544
00:47:00,944 --> 00:47:02,070
Who did this to you?

545
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,239
-A pair of tens!
-Yes!

546
00:47:06,783 --> 00:47:08,660
You rude bastard!

547
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:11,329
Shut up
and revert what you did to my brother.

548
00:47:12,247 --> 00:47:13,498
Your brother?

549
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:15,124
The nine-tailed fox from earlier?

550
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:21,214
Dokgakgwi won them.

551
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:23,758
Give it back.

552
00:47:25,218 --> 00:47:28,304
What makes you think you can take
my brother's scant life span?

553
00:47:28,972 --> 00:47:30,682
A bet is a bet.

554
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:31,975
I'll kill you.

555
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:34,269
Why don't you try?

556
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:37,105
Let's see if that'll bring
his life span back.

557
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:39,524
Assertive as always, sir!

558
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:41,651
Lord Dokgakgwi is never scared.

559
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:47,407
Come on. Let's see you try.

560
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:49,951
Hurry up and stab me. Go on.

561
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:54,581
What do you want?

562
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:58,042
I'll give you anything you want,
so revert his life span.

563
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:02,505
Really? Then gamble against me.

564
00:48:02,589 --> 00:48:05,258
You can beat me
and win his life span back, right?

565
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,347
I don't gamble.

566
00:48:11,431 --> 00:48:13,141
Then it can't be helped.

567
00:48:14,142 --> 00:48:17,812
-Let's set up for another game!
-Yes, sir. Set the table!

568
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:22,483
Quickly, quick.

569
00:48:25,737 --> 00:48:29,032
Boss, what do I do?
What will happen to you?

570
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:30,366
Quit being noisy.

571
00:48:31,034 --> 00:48:34,495
You can lead the gang when I'm gone.

572
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:40,668
Boss, don't die.
We promised to take all of Gyeongseong!

573
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:42,253
Stop whining.

574
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:44,422
Do me a favor.

575
00:49:06,778 --> 00:49:07,987
Why did you do that?

576
00:49:09,364 --> 00:49:11,491
Why risk your life on a stupid bet?

577
00:49:13,326 --> 00:49:14,619
It's my life.

578
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:17,330
Who cares what I do with it.

579
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:20,291
You pathetic bastard.

580
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:23,586
You take responsibility
for your own actions.

581
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:27,340
You're finally showing your true colors.

582
00:49:29,342 --> 00:49:34,263
-Fine, this is you after all.
-You get sick and hurt day in, day out.

583
00:49:35,056 --> 00:49:37,517
And now you go so far as
to lose your own life span?

584
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,852
How much longer must I clean up after you?

585
00:49:39,936 --> 00:49:41,187
It's your fault!

586
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:44,899
It's you who made me this way.

587
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:47,443
Why are you acting like this? Huh?

588
00:49:48,528 --> 00:49:51,864
Please, can't you just live a decent life?

589
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:57,954
How am I supposed to leave now? Damn it.

590
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:05,962
-Hey.
-Geez.

591
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:10,258
You're crying? Because of me?

592
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:14,220
-I wasn't crying!
-I didn't want to die!

593
00:50:15,471 --> 00:50:18,766
I, too, wanted to live.

594
00:50:24,856 --> 00:50:25,857
You…

595
00:50:28,151 --> 00:50:29,318
What do you mean?

596
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:34,365
You would know better, no?

597
00:50:42,457 --> 00:50:44,542
Lord Lee Yeon is gambling
with his life span!

598
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,058
-Begin.
-Before we do that,

599
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:03,311
I must check how much you have.

600
00:51:07,607 --> 00:51:10,610
Fifty-two years? You're kidding?

601
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:12,945
What kind of mountain god has this little?

602
00:51:13,029 --> 00:51:14,989
When I have this much.

603
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,450
I decided to die on the same day
as a human woman.

604
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:20,286
-Pathetic bastard.
-Fine.

605
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:22,205
Give him 52 candles.

606
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:26,667
What an embarrassing amount.

607
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:40,598
All right, I bet 10 years.

608
00:51:42,225 --> 00:51:43,559
Call.

609
00:51:46,062 --> 00:51:47,355
Show me.

610
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:50,191
It's a high seven.

611
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:53,653
-I got a high nine!
-That's right!

612
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:54,737
As expected!

613
00:51:57,114 --> 00:52:00,701
Dokgakgwi! Dokgakgwi!

614
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:03,162
That's 10 years off your life span.

615
00:52:21,931 --> 00:52:25,309
All right. I bet 12 years.

616
00:52:31,566 --> 00:52:32,692
Here we go.

617
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:35,528
Pair of ones.

618
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:37,989
Pair of twos!

619
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:39,532
-That's right!
-All right!

620
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:45,580
Dokgakgwi is better at cards
than a mountain god. How's that?

621
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:47,832
You feeling all jittery?

622
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:53,337
What? Did you just laugh?

623
00:52:54,589 --> 00:52:56,173
Fine, then.

624
00:52:57,008 --> 00:52:58,217
Do you want to shuffle?

625
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:11,772
Oh, goodness.
Looks like he's never gambled before.

626
00:53:11,856 --> 00:53:15,067
You're risking your life span
with such petty skills?

627
00:53:15,151 --> 00:53:17,904
-Exactly my point!
-Guess we're holding a funeral today.

628
00:53:17,987 --> 00:53:20,072
-Oh, my goodness.
-What a pity.

629
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:23,451
This time…

630
00:53:24,911 --> 00:53:26,913
I bet 20 years.

631
00:53:26,996 --> 00:53:28,664
How's that? Are you scared?

632
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:31,125
Call.

633
00:53:31,918 --> 00:53:35,171
If you lose this time,
you'll only have ten years left.

634
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:37,381
Your hand.

635
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:44,263
My hand, my hand!

636
00:53:44,764 --> 00:53:46,015
Oh, my hand!

637
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:50,978
My hand, my hand.

638
00:53:51,604 --> 00:53:52,647
A three bright.

639
00:53:54,315 --> 00:53:56,192
That cunning little--

640
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:57,652
Give me back my hand!

641
00:53:57,735 --> 00:54:00,112
That evil bastard cheated!

642
00:54:00,196 --> 00:54:03,199
This was the first time.
Believe me. I swear.

643
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:04,825
Bullshit.

644
00:54:05,368 --> 00:54:06,786
Let it slide this once, okay?

645
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:11,040
I can't gamble with a hand missing.

646
00:54:14,377 --> 00:54:15,503
Fine, then.

647
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:19,215
-But all our previous games are invalid.
-Yes, yes, of course.

648
00:54:19,298 --> 00:54:22,551
Now you will play fair against me.
Let's say I win.

649
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:28,224
Then, you return my brother's life span,
and all that belongs to these gods.

650
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:32,937
Yes, that's right. Rightfully so.

651
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:37,692
Though poor and powerless,
they are still tutelary deities.

652
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:40,736
You've no right to take their lives.

653
00:54:41,529 --> 00:54:43,030
Answer me!

654
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:50,955
Whatever. Fine. Bring it on!

655
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:57,253
We have him now.

656
00:55:08,848 --> 00:55:10,141
What is Yeon up to?

657
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:12,018
He's gambling with Dokgakgwi.

658
00:55:14,437 --> 00:55:15,646
Has he lost it or what?

659
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:18,733
I've never seen anyone
beat Dokgakgwi in gambling.

660
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:23,988
I searched everywhere, ma'am.
There's no guardian stone or golden ruler.

661
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:26,365
He's more careful than you'd think.

662
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:30,244
-Shall I continue searching?
-That's okay.

663
00:55:32,121 --> 00:55:33,998
We'll make him give it to us himself.

664
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:50,389
All right.

665
00:55:50,473 --> 00:55:52,391
I'm going all in.

666
00:55:53,893 --> 00:55:56,479
-Is he crazy?
-Playing aggressive from the start?

667
00:55:56,562 --> 00:56:00,816
It's all or nothing now.
The Dokgakgwi is terrifying when angered.

668
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,444
-Terrifying.
-So, so terrifying!

669
00:56:06,197 --> 00:56:10,951
If you call,
I'll valuate yours to the price of mine.

670
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:14,622
One of us dies here.

671
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:17,625
This is too scary. I can't watch.

672
00:56:26,008 --> 00:56:27,176
I fold.

673
00:56:29,512 --> 00:56:31,013
It's a high zero!

674
00:56:32,223 --> 00:56:34,183
You went all in with that awful hand?

675
00:56:34,809 --> 00:56:37,061
Why didn't you call then?
You would've won.

676
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:41,941
All in.

677
00:56:42,775 --> 00:56:43,859
Fold.

678
00:56:43,943 --> 00:56:45,778
-All in.
-Fold.

679
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:48,030
-Oh, gosh!
-Geez.

680
00:56:48,656 --> 00:56:50,074
-All in.
-Fold.

681
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:51,158
All in!

682
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:58,165
-Fold.
-Mountain god is such a chicken.

683
00:56:58,249 --> 00:56:59,500
Mountain god is scared.

684
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,014
It's worth betting this time.

685
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:17,810
Should I bet?

686
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:19,562
All in.

687
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:23,482
Will you call or not?

688
00:57:24,316 --> 00:57:28,070
The problem is… is he bluffing?

689
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:31,657
No, let's fold this time.

690
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,242
One last time.

691
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:38,080
-What's wrong?
-Is he dead?

692
00:57:38,164 --> 00:57:39,456
I'm warning you.

693
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:41,750
You leave the seat, game's over.

694
00:57:42,418 --> 00:57:43,586
No second chances.

695
00:57:49,508 --> 00:57:54,138
Rang, hang in there a little longer.
Trust me, I'll save you.

696
00:57:56,432 --> 00:57:59,643
So much big talk
for someone losing every game.

697
00:58:09,528 --> 00:58:11,739
All it takes is a single round.

698
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:16,952
If I lose, Rang and I will both die here.

699
00:58:17,036 --> 00:58:18,370
Will you call or not?

700
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:24,960
-Say call, say call.
-Will he be okay?

701
00:58:25,044 --> 00:58:29,381
He's the great mountain god, after all.
Everyone, let's support him.

702
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:32,760
Say call, say call!

703
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:35,971
-Say call!
-No. Please, don't do it.

704
00:58:36,472 --> 00:58:41,018
It's not a bad idea to take out a demon
of that caliber in advance.

705
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:48,067
-Say call! Say call!
-Say call! Say call!

706
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:50,653
Fine.

707
00:58:52,321 --> 00:58:53,822
Bring it on.

708
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:59,828
Fine, I'll open my hands.

709
00:59:00,913 --> 00:59:02,039
PAIR OF TENS

710
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:03,540
Are you sure you won't regret this?

711
00:59:03,624 --> 00:59:04,833
I'm not the regretting type.

712
00:59:04,917 --> 00:59:06,335
A PAIR OF EIGHTS

713
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:08,879
One, two, three!

714
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:17,638
What's this?

715
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:25,729
He lost?

716
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,877
Thank you for sparing my life.

717
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:50,754
Hey!

718
00:59:51,422 --> 00:59:54,008
-Thank you.
-Thank you, sir.

719
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:56,844
I'll live doing good now.

720
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:59,638
No more gambling.
Don't wrestle anyone either.

721
00:59:59,722 --> 01:00:00,848
Yes, sir!

722
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:03,142
-Let's go.
-Okay.

723
01:00:03,225 --> 01:00:04,893
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you, sir.

724
01:00:04,977 --> 01:00:05,978
Go on, you.

725
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:10,065
We're grateful.

726
01:00:10,149 --> 01:00:12,192
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you so much.

727
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:13,277
No need to thank me.

728
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,195
Just stop bothering the old hag.

729
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:18,991
But why did you
retrieve our life spans too?

730
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,286
It's a chaotic time
for the indigenous gods.

731
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:23,871
And it will continue.

732
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:27,207
If you want to survive,
find yourself a grounding.

733
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,336
Learn to live among the humans
in the new world.

734
01:00:30,419 --> 01:00:32,838
-Yes, sir.
-Thank you.

735
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:34,465
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

736
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:41,805
If the governor's office had this,
something's happened to the guy I met, no?

737
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:45,142
He's off the grid?

738
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:47,436
Not only him.

739
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:51,398
All our contacts based in Gyeongseong
went off the grid.

740
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:55,027
-Just how far have we been compromised?
-We don't have time.

741
01:00:56,862 --> 01:00:58,781
The Governor-General's moving too.

742
01:00:59,615 --> 01:01:02,826
Are you saying we should proceed
with this few of us?

743
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:06,163
Moving with the fewest
may be for the best.

744
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:10,501
First, I'll find out the time and place.

745
01:01:11,752 --> 01:01:12,878
You should all go home.

746
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:18,926
You should stay safe.

747
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:23,806
-Shin-ju, please protect Eun-ho.
-Yes, ma'am.

748
01:01:29,812 --> 01:01:31,480
I need an answer today.

749
01:01:32,106 --> 01:01:34,566
Koo Shin-ju, what are you?

750
01:01:36,068 --> 01:01:37,361
What do you mean by that?

751
01:01:37,444 --> 01:01:41,323
I was captured by the Jangsan Tiger.
I met a self-proclaimed mountain god too.

752
01:01:41,407 --> 01:01:43,742
Don't you think it's time
I knew about my comrade…

753
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:46,745
who lives through gun shot wounds?

754
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:50,332
You--

755
01:01:51,542 --> 01:01:53,710
You intend to remarry with whom?

756
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:57,548
Ginko Tawara, my sister-in-law.

757
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:02,344
Have you lost your mind?
I don't care how many times you marry.

758
01:02:02,428 --> 01:02:04,805
But I can't let my Ginko marry a divorcee.

759
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:07,599
-You know how I raised her!
-You will change your mind

760
01:02:07,683 --> 01:02:08,976
when you see this.

761
01:02:10,436 --> 01:02:11,478
Come in.

762
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:22,156
He's a member of the Manchuria-based
Independence Volunteer Corps,

763
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:25,784
responsible for the recent bombings
at Gyeongseong station.

764
01:02:25,868 --> 01:02:30,330
Are you saying that
he's the one who robbed my house?

765
01:02:30,414 --> 01:02:32,916
That's what we thought at first.

766
01:02:35,878 --> 01:02:37,671
But there's a catch.

767
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:44,887
PLEASE USE THIS
FOR THE INDEPENDENCE OF JOSEON

768
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:48,682
Written with a typewriter.

769
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:53,520
How many people do you think could afford
to use a typewriter in Gyeongseong?

770
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:04,740
You're trying to bring Ginko into this
with this lousy note?

771
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:10,078
-Go ahead!
-Sit back down.

772
01:03:12,706 --> 01:03:13,790
Father-in-law.

773
01:03:15,334 --> 01:03:16,960
We're only getting started now.

774
01:03:23,842 --> 01:03:24,843
We have a witness.

775
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:29,890
I saw it with my own two eyes.

776
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:33,727
I saw Ms. Ginko Tawara at the station
when the bombing occurred.

777
01:03:35,103 --> 01:03:36,146
A fox?

778
01:03:37,898 --> 01:03:39,107
You're a fox?

779
01:03:40,484 --> 01:03:42,736
It's top secret on our side of things.

780
01:03:44,071 --> 01:03:45,697
That's why you said that.

781
01:03:45,781 --> 01:03:48,325
That the world I know
may not be everything.

782
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:49,493
You believe me?

783
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,746
Normally, humans are disbelieving
even after witnessing all.

784
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:53,997
I want to believe you.

785
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:56,375
Do ghosts exist too?

786
01:03:57,918 --> 01:03:59,211
Why do you ask?

787
01:04:08,262 --> 01:04:09,388
That's my sister.

788
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:16,019
It's the anniversary of her death soon,
so I wondered if she'd come to her ritual.

789
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:19,064
How did she pass?

790
01:04:19,147 --> 01:04:23,026
The Chief Commissioner says it's suicide.
But I don't believe that bastard.

791
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:24,736
On the day she died,

792
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:28,282
we promised to go see the azaleas
at Changgyeongwon.

793
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:33,996
Don't tell me your sister was…

794
01:04:34,705 --> 01:04:39,751
I think she was murdered
by my brother-in-law.

795
01:04:42,671 --> 01:04:43,714
Man, it's breezy.

796
01:04:44,298 --> 01:04:45,299
How did you win?

797
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:50,929
Like this.

798
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:52,514
A three bright?

799
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:54,308
Don't tell me you…

800
01:04:58,020 --> 01:04:59,730
My hand, my hand!

801
01:05:00,439 --> 01:05:02,357
Oh, my hand!

802
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:07,821
Though I can't gamble,
I'm a quick learner.

803
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:10,324
Wow! And you cut off his wrist
for playing dirty.

804
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:12,868
It's called having double standards.

805
01:05:17,372 --> 01:05:22,210
Tell me what happened to us
in the future you are from.

806
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:29,134
Want to see yourself?

807
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:38,393
All right, look at this.

808
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:42,147
It's me.

809
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:44,107
I'm going to die soon.

810
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:47,611
If you were here,
you would come to save me.

811
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,614
But I have no one to depend on.
I'm totally doomed.

812
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:53,283
I'm going to be reborn
as a Dokdo humpback shrimp.

813
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:55,702
So don't eat them, just in case.

814
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,080
I hope…

815
01:05:58,163 --> 01:05:59,831
you are reborn too.

816
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:02,417
But still,

817
01:06:03,752 --> 01:06:05,170
if we can…

818
01:06:07,881 --> 01:06:09,383
let's meet again.

819
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:14,262
Yeon.

820
01:06:22,062 --> 01:06:23,397
Can you forgive me?

821
01:06:23,939 --> 01:06:27,317
You protected me,
but I couldn't protect you.

822
01:06:31,405 --> 01:06:35,909
Forget about me.
How come you die so early?

823
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:38,537
-Did that human ask you to die with her?
-No.

824
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,331
It was my decision.

825
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:45,836
I've been living for infinite years
neither aging nor dying.

826
01:06:46,837 --> 01:06:49,923
-This isn't so bad either.
-Nothing good about it either.

827
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:54,219
The feeling of cherishing every second
of my life like a normal human.

828
01:06:54,302 --> 01:06:58,181
Living as a mortal, I finally
saw the beauty filling this world.

829
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:03,937
By the way…

830
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:08,442
Did you cry?

831
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:14,156
Did you cry a river after I died?

832
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:26,001
Not really.
I don't have tears to cry, you rascal.

833
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:27,085
Why you--

834
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:29,796
Rang!

835
01:07:33,258 --> 01:07:35,051
I thought you were going to die!

836
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:41,391
-I'm not dead.
-I told you! I knew it!

837
01:07:41,475 --> 01:07:44,770
-You're so mean, really.
-Sorry.

838
01:07:44,853 --> 01:07:48,565
Still, I guess the last thing
you wanted to see was my face?

839
01:07:52,486 --> 01:07:55,447
I mean-- My boss
is such a hopeless romantic.

840
01:08:03,497 --> 01:08:06,625
If I could,
I would've folded him into my suitcase

841
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:09,419
to take him to the era that I belonged to.

842
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:12,839
However, my little brother

843
01:08:13,548 --> 01:08:16,551
grew up and found his own place.

844
01:08:16,635 --> 01:08:19,012
Living a life of his own.

845
01:08:24,142 --> 01:08:25,310
Who would've imagined?

846
01:08:25,977 --> 01:08:28,021
The Japanese colonized Joseon!

847
01:08:28,522 --> 01:08:29,815
Wanna know what's more?

848
01:08:29,898 --> 01:08:32,442
Future Joseon will split
into North and South,

849
01:08:32,526 --> 01:08:35,237
so I can't even willingly go
to Baekdusan, our home!

850
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:43,578
I want to go home with you.

851
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:49,334
I wonder if the persimmon tree
we planted is well.

852
01:08:51,878 --> 01:08:55,507
So Ho-yeong, hurry and wake up.

853
01:08:56,925 --> 01:08:57,926
Moo-yeong.

854
01:08:59,094 --> 01:09:03,640
To be fully revived, I need
the guardian stone and golden ruler.

855
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:04,933
Okay.

856
01:09:07,102 --> 01:09:08,103
I'll bring them.

857
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:24,452
Who is it?

858
01:09:25,245 --> 01:09:27,747
Who poisoned my well?

859
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:32,252
It's me.

860
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:37,966
Please save me!

861
01:09:39,968 --> 01:09:42,095
Save me!

862
01:10:00,906 --> 01:10:05,952
The demons of Joseon
are all a bunch of cowards.

863
01:10:21,468 --> 01:10:23,136
They were to be captured alive.

864
01:10:23,887 --> 01:10:25,722
But I can't control my strength!

865
01:10:27,474 --> 01:10:28,892
I'm hungry.

866
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:30,852
Buy me a meal.

867
01:10:31,519 --> 01:10:32,646
I'm busy.

868
01:10:33,355 --> 01:10:36,107
I heard an interesting rumor.

869
01:10:38,068 --> 01:10:39,945
What could it be?

870
01:10:42,948 --> 01:10:47,702
They say there's a treasure in Myoyeongak.

871
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:53,291
A treasure?

872
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:15,814
-They're dead.
-Lord Lee Yeon!

873
01:11:17,524 --> 01:11:20,944
The well god, crock god,
and even the totem pole disappeared.

874
01:11:21,027 --> 01:11:25,073
Search the Gyeongseong grounds,
and find out who's behind this.

875
01:11:25,156 --> 01:11:26,157
Yes, sir.

876
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:28,952
Rang.

877
01:11:32,998 --> 01:11:34,833
-Have our guys on this.
-Yes, sir!

878
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:51,224
I was going to let things slide
to prepare to leave,

879
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:52,684
but that's not going to work.

880
01:11:58,023 --> 01:12:02,652
TALE OF THE NINE TAILED

881
01:12:26,593 --> 01:12:27,802
I'm going to kill

882
01:12:27,886 --> 01:12:29,971
all the Japanese demons before I go home.

883
01:12:30,055 --> 01:12:32,849
Four Japanese demons
and two mountain gods, it's six to one.

884
01:12:32,932 --> 01:12:34,434
I'll be the bait.

885
01:12:35,477 --> 01:12:37,062
It's over now.

886
01:12:37,145 --> 01:12:40,231
Hand over the treasure
if you want to save your brother.

887
01:12:40,315 --> 01:12:43,735
I'll snatch the treasure
while Yeon and Moo-yeong are fighting.

888
01:12:43,818 --> 01:12:46,029
I never start a losing fight.

889
01:12:46,112 --> 01:12:49,199
What if Hong-joo
and Moo-yeong sides with us?

890
01:12:50,241 --> 01:12:52,494
Catch them with me.

891
01:12:52,577 --> 01:12:54,537
As the last mountain gods of Joseon.

892
01:12:56,039 --> 01:12:59,042
