1
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:56,974
TALE OF THE NINE TAILED

2
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:27,880
It's you.

3
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:30,508
The Korean who threw a bomb
at Gyeongseong Station.

4
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,759
Which organization sent you?

5
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:34,720
The commander is dead!

6
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,350
Damn it.

7
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:42,770
Geez.

8
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:46,398
This damn alarm.
It's ringing even decades into the past.

9
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:48,818
Did you see that?

10
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:52,071
Music played
from that matchbox-looking thing.

11
00:01:52,655 --> 00:01:54,657
-What is that thing?
-Oh, my!

12
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,075
Answer me!

13
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:57,535
I'm going to school.

14
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,453
The box just spoke.

15
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:01,247
Is there someone inside the thing?

16
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:05,459
Are there any tasty restaurants
around here?

17
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,628
Geez. Forget it.

18
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,047
Don't move!

19
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,299
I don't understand a word you're babbling.

20
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:14,510
I'm undereducated.
I didn't even take the CSAT.

21
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:16,804
By the way, have you guys seen my stuff?

22
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,807
It looks like a small rock,
but it's very important to me.

23
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,646
I said don't move!

24
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:37,908
Damn it.

25
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,077
You made a hole here.

26
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,580
I'm on a day trip,
so this was my only outfit!

27
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:57,177
-What the hell are you?
-Speak in my language.

28
00:02:58,137 --> 00:02:59,763
Who-- Who are you?

29
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:02,600
Me?

30
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:11,525
I'm Joseon's nine-tailed fox.

31
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:13,485
LEE YEON: A NINE-TAILED FOX
WHO LOVED A HUMAN

32
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:14,695
FORMER GOD OF MT. BAEKDUDAEGAN

33
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,655
LIKES: MINT CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM
DISLIKES: DENTIST

34
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,575
Shoot! Shoot and kill him!

35
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:19,760
Give me your gun.

36
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:22,429
I said give it to me!

37
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:26,100
Stay still.

38
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,018
Don't even breathe.

39
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,874
Quit smoking, you punk!

40
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:59,341
I'm his older brother.
Smoking's bad for you, right?

41
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,474
Wait a minute.

42
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,832
Brother, you still alive?

43
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,045
LEE RANG: HALF-FOX, HALF-HUMAN

44
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:37,963
LIKES: HIS BROTHER
DISLIKES: HIS BROTHER

45
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:39,506
DIED IN 2020 TO SAVE HIS BROTHER

46
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:45,679
THIS GUY'S HALF-BROTHER

47
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,948
-You called the Japanese Army on me?
-Yeah.

48
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,117
"The Gyeongseong Station bomber
is my brother."

49
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:08,994
Do I look like a bomber to you?

50
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:11,288
You're a walking bomb yourself.

51
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,415
Damn, it's annoying just to see your face.

52
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:16,919
So my brother's a scumbag
even in the Japanese colonial period, huh?

53
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,629
All thanks to my shitty upbringing.

54
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,512
Are you baffled? I get it.

55
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:29,515
Because that's exactly
how I feel right now.

56
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,978
Why am I back
in the Japanese colonial era of Joseon,

57
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,189
filming some fake Western movie?

58
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:40,526
Moreover, why has my deceased brother
become a heavy smoker,

59
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,444
roaming the Gyeongseong grounds?

60
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:18,105
They say brotherhood is like a film noir.

61
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:22,776
But there's a more complicated story
behind why our family is such a mess.

62
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,999
I'm a nine-tailed fox
who fell in love with a human.

63
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,586
And I paid a heavy price for that.

64
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,713
You abandoned your duty
as the mountain god

65
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,548
and left the mountains for a human and--

66
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:45,716
Yes.

67
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:47,968
I abandoned you.

68
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,555
For a long time,

69
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,682
we were each others' foes.

70
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,353
-Did you miss me?
-Want to die, brother?

71
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:01,481
After crossing the boundary
between life and death…

72
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:04,359
I've never abandoned you.

73
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:07,321
…we reconciled as brothers again.

74
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,785
You better make it out alive.

75
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:18,123
In 2020, I died once.

76
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:21,418
But I was reincarnated,

77
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,546
fulfilling my lifelong wish
to become human, but…

78
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,800
I've been giving you a hard time
for many years,

79
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:31,178
but I won't apologize.

80
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:35,599
But still, if we can…

81
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,895
let's meet again.

82
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:46,485
My brother.

83
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:49,363
My younger brother, Lee Rang,

84
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:54,076
sacrificed his life to save me
and left my side forever.

85
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:55,702
4 MONTHS LATER

86
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:57,412
Why can't Lee Rang reincarnate?

87
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,748
DISROBING OLD WOMAN
OWNER OF THE STREAM OF THE DEAD

88
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,584
That's the law of the afterlife.
It's the law!

89
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:03,919
Man, that damn law!

90
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,003
EPISODE 1

91
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:07,005
He died to save me, you hear?

92
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:13,011
He may have saved you, but you know
how many more he's killed, right?

93
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:15,305
Fine.

94
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,227
I'll yield my custody rights,
so bring him back.

95
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,730
Custody rights, my foot.

96
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:27,401
Hey, you think I want to change
the diapers of a 1,600-year-old man?

97
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:30,320
I'll do whatever you say, old hag.

98
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,366
I see you've finally learned your place.

99
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,248
Damn you.

100
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:48,588
Ever since my best performer retired,
I've been having a hard time.

101
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:51,341
"On the condition
that Lee Rang reincarnates,

102
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:54,094
Lee Yeon will punish everyone
that disturbs the living

103
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,971
and repay the kindness received."

104
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,181
-Sign it.
-Hold on.

105
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,310
What's written here? Why is it so tiny?

106
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:06,732
"Your term as a nine-tailed fox will last
until the Disrobing Old Woman says so."

107
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:09,735
An indefinite contract?

108
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:13,196
Even insurance contracts are audited
against such dubious clauses.

109
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,656
You-- You--

110
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,743
Old age hasn't affected your vision, huh?

111
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,120
You can have me. Fine.

112
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:23,415
But I don't want immortality
or indefinite contracts.

113
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:26,251
Let me die on the same day as Ji-ah.

114
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,628
That's my only condition.

115
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,717
They say a fox never abandons its mate
until the day it dies.

116
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,012
I see your love for her remains unchanged.

117
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,772
YOUR TERM AS A NINE-TAILED FOX
WILL END ON YOUR WIFE'S DEATH

118
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,069
LEE YEON

119
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:58,450
It seemed as if this story
would have a happy ending.

120
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,119
However…

121
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:03,038
AFTERLIFE IMMIGRATION OFFICE

122
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,248
Was it because of the lunar eclipse?

123
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:07,834
Or…

124
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:12,297
because of the uninvited guest
who slipped in during the eclipse?

125
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,194
Since the disaster
at the Stream of the Dead,

126
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,989
the boundary between the living
and the dead,

127
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:44,413
everything associated with me and my life
began to go awry.

128
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,874
Mint chocolate chip, right?
Will that be to go?

129
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,085
For here. I'd like to order two today.

130
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,379
The other one's for your wife, huh?

131
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,345
-Yeon! Yeon!
-That scared me.

132
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:02,848
-We're in trouble!
-What brings you here?

133
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,101
My gosh--
Some guy wearing a red-white mask…

134
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:07,936
CLOTHES-HANGING OLD MAN

135
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,896
…came and stole the guardian stone!

136
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,817
-What's that?
-The precious stone on our roof.

137
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,902
The King of the Dead made it himself

138
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,155
to protect the boundary
between the living and the dead.

139
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,658
If it's so special,
why put it on the roof and not in a safe?

140
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,203
That's because it marks the boundary
of the Stream of the Dead.

141
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,289
The boundary?

142
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,709
Then that means--

143
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,795
Yes, evil spirits are flocking in!

144
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,256
Goodness-- Hurry, let's go!

145
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,927
Honey, don't come. Yeah, yeah.

146
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:47,601
I just need to find
the guardian stone, right?

147
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,352
Where did that thief run off to?

148
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:52,189
Of all places…

149
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:57,319
Here?

150
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,906
This leads straight to hell, right?

151
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,866
Fiery-Cauldron Hell? Ice Hell?

152
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,826
It doesn't lead to hell…

153
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,208
Been a while, Disrobing Old Woman!

154
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:16,087
Gosh, you've been occupying
the Stream of the Dead for too long!

155
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,298
What a crowd you've mustered.

156
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,429
I was going to give you this
when your term ended.

157
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:28,308
-A watch?
-You will eventually go blind and deaf.

158
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,143
Can she not hear me?

159
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,354
Disrobing Old Woman!

160
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:40,028
When that happens, look into this watch.
Don't forget you're on borrowed time.

161
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,658
-Yes, sir.
-Disrobing Old Woman--

162
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:49,913
-Good.
-Attack!

163
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,039
My goodness.

164
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:56,253
Go!

165
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:01,216
Find the stone and return
before the Hour of the Tiger.

166
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:04,386
Hour of the Tiger…
So just before sunrise: 5:00 a.m.

167
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,140
Oh, how do I come back?

168
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,518
Through the same cabinet.

169
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:17,899
Remember, the gate will close
at the Hour of the Tiger.

170
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:18,984
Where is he going?

171
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,402
Stop him!

172
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,240
Go!

173
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,077
I'll be back.

174
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,045
Lord Lee Yeon!

175
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,757
-Oh, gosh!
-Shin-ju?

176
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,634
Where's Lord Lee Yeon?

177
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,929
-Hurry!
-Yes, ma'am.

178
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,098
Just a minute--

179
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:02,694
It's so bright.

180
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,702
What's this? Where the hell…

181
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:13,580
What the…

182
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,420
What?

183
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,007
What's going on?

184
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,512
Wait…

185
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:36,436
-Shall we go to Mitsukoshi?
-Okay.

186
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:40,523
My face powder has run out.
What do you want to buy?

187
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:54,120
Extra! Extra!

188
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,122
Extra!

189
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,124
Extra!

190
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,461
Year 13 of the Showa era…

191
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,881
Year 1938?

192
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,717
Japanese colonial period?

193
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,058
Damn, I don't believe this!

194
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:18,436
Oh, geez!

195
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:24,234
D-16 HOURS

196
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:29,239
UNTIL THE STREAM OF THE DEAD'S
"GATE OF TIME" CLOSES

197
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,199
Lord Lee Yeon?

198
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:33,827
Water Snail Bride?

199
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,746
What brings you here?
You haven't been here in a while.

200
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,374
Oh, I haven't?

201
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:42,711
Didn't you go to Gunsan
with Shin-ju last year?

202
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:45,547
-What in the world are you doing there?
-Right.

203
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,383
So I just got back from Gunsan…

204
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:52,178
It's not like I'm running a restaurant.
I'm just running errands and such…

205
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:53,513
What time is it?

206
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:56,015
It's 1:10 p.m.

207
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:59,102
Wow, that meticulous old hag.
She even set the time difference.

208
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,479
-Time difference?
-Never mind.

209
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:03,440
For goodness' sake.

210
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,358
Someone over there--

211
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,278
That masked man is staring straight at us.

212
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,150
Who are you?

213
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:39,494
GYEONGSEONG STATION

214
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,538
Popsicles!

215
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,042
Pay before you eat! Damn, you brat.

216
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,883
I'm sorry.

217
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:01,808
Thief! Thief!

218
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,174
Move!

219
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,365
Who are you people?

220
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:00,825
Protect the commander!

221
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:02,952
Freeze!

222
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,037
Damn it.

223
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:11,461
What?

224
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,801
Ki Yoo-ri?

225
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:43,952
Chiyorika? Chiyorika!

226
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,205
For Korea's independence!

227
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:48,706
Hooray!

228
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,714
Where's the bitch who threw the bomb?
Find her!

229
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,843
Hooray!

230
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:04,722
For Korea's independence! Hooray! Hooray!

231
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:06,849
Shit.

232
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,230
Damn it!

233
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,779
Hey.

234
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,158
-Hey, hey! Hey, you!
-Shoot 'em!

235
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:55,106
Long live Korea!

236
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,865
Hooray!

237
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:09,162
Spy alert! Run!

238
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,748
-Hide! Hide!
-Get out of here! Run!

239
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:14,709
The horse!

240
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:18,171
One, two, on you go!

241
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,713
What the heck?

242
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,381
They're not human.

243
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:09,013
Giddyap!

244
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:16,896
Stop, you punk!

245
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:19,982
Don't come near! Giddyap!

246
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:41,963
Boss!

247
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,466
Boss! Boss!

248
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:48,803
Boss!

249
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,352
How dare you touch my stuff?

250
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:03,317
Oh, boss…

251
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:28,759
-Rang.
-Lee Yeon?

252
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:30,845
You're alive.

253
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,056
You're alive…

254
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:36,809
in this era.

255
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,146
Die!

256
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:46,611
Thank goodness.

257
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:50,323
Your heart is beating,
and you're breathing just fine.

258
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:54,952
You're alive, my brother.

259
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:56,996
-I'm so glad.
-Get lost, you bastard.

260
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,832
Did you take opium or what?

261
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:04,045
I'm sorry.

262
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:06,088
We don't have much time, Rang.

263
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:07,673
Hand it over.

264
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:09,759
Here.

265
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:12,261
It's right here.

266
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,849
Oh, my-- Goodness!

267
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,394
Oh, gosh. That was nauseating.

268
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:24,482
Lord Lee Yeon!

269
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,609
Lord Lee Yeon!

270
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:31,405
Lord Lee Yeon!

271
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,117
Why isn't anyone passing by?

272
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:37,536
How long have I been walking?

273
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:44,001
Excuse me! Here! Over here!

274
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:45,628
Stop, stop!

275
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,214
-Can I get a ride?
-Get in.

276
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:50,258
Get in? Okay. Great!

277
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,682
KOO SHIN-JU - A NATIVE FOX
LEE YEON'S RIGHT-HAND FOX

278
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:59,934
SPECIALTY:
ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND ANIMALS

279
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,901
-What's up with your hair?
-Don't touch me! I'll kill you.

280
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:11,028
I can't believe you're a bandit leader.

281
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,031
You've been doing this for 30 years?

282
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:16,826
Yeah. Stealing, plundering and killing.

283
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:20,538
It's my fault.

284
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:24,834
After I lost my beloved,
I couldn't afford to care for you.

285
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:28,170
You… You know you disgust me, right?

286
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:32,174
I know, but…

287
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,885
I really wanted to tell you this.

288
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,267
I…

289
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:43,686
did you wrong.

290
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,443
Let me go.

291
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:55,031
Can't you see that
I'm trying to believe your bullshit?

292
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,456
You sure this is okay, boss?

293
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:05,750
He's family.

294
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:11,297
Wow. No wonder. You sure are strong, sir.

295
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:15,217
Get off me!

296
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:17,928
What are they? If not human, what?

297
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:20,723
-A pack of wolves.
-I see.

298
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:23,768
We used to have a different boss,

299
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:26,437
but Lord Lee Rang slit his throat
in one go, so--

300
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:30,358
-You turned coats?
-But I prefer Boss Rang.

301
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:32,735
Is Rang good to you?

302
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:33,861
No.

303
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:38,366
Even so, a whole bunch of guys
are lined up to join our gang.

304
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:39,450
Why?

305
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:43,579
Boss divides the stolen goods
equally among us every time.

306
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,332
-That's not easy, you know.
-Cut the crap and get out.

307
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:47,792
Yes, sir.

308
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,252
Oh, stop that.

309
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:52,588
Let's go.

310
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,719
Have some.

311
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:01,305
I'll just have one drink.

312
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:05,684
What is that thing, anyway?

313
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:13,109
Something that shouldn't be in this era.
I must return it to its rightful place.

314
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:17,822
You have no idea

315
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:21,242
how much I longed to see you again

316
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:24,161
and how much I missed you.

317
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,040
Drink.

318
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,342
I had so much to tell you.

319
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:43,556
But now, just seeing you breathe
makes me happy.

320
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:47,768
Say something.

321
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:53,065
After today,
you might not see me for a while.

322
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:56,777
So say whatever you have in mind.

323
00:28:58,154 --> 00:28:59,530
Let me hear your voice.

324
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:06,162
Hang on.

325
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:08,706
What's that in your mouth?

326
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,334
You have something in your mouth.

327
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:22,720
You bastard.

328
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:33,898
Run, run, run!

329
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:37,359
-Run, run!
-Move it.

330
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:38,903
Go! Get her!

331
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,586
Bring her.

332
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:56,921
My beer…

333
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:05,346
My beer, you bastard!
Give me back my beer! My beer!

334
00:30:06,764 --> 00:30:09,642
That hurts! It hurts!

335
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:13,187
Watch out for fire.

336
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,147
The fire, fire… Watch out for fire.

337
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:17,441
What's this crazy prick saying?

338
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:25,699
I said, "Watch out for fire."

339
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:36,961
Fire!

340
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:40,881
It burns!

341
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:02,236
You're awake.

342
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:07,533
Who are you?

343
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:09,285
"Who are you"?

344
00:31:11,412 --> 00:31:15,416
I'm the one you owe money to.
You'll have to pay for my beer.

345
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,881
I don't have money right now,
but I will pay you back.

346
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:26,260
I'm Sun-woo Eun-ho,
a reporter for the Seonwoo Daily.

347
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:27,511
If you're a reporter,

348
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:31,557
why are you being chased
by armed detectives in broad daylight?

349
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,684
You smell of gunpowder too.

350
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:42,443
Then don't go saving women
who reek of gunpowder.

351
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:44,903
Can I have some?

352
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:53,871
Wait.

353
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:57,041
Your name?

354
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,794
I should at least know
who I'm indebted to.

355
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:03,797
Mu-yeong. I'm Cheon Mu-yeong.

356
00:32:09,345 --> 00:32:10,679
Are you a doctor?

357
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,641
You've treated my wounds
like a professional.

358
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:16,435
Well, I was only trying my best.

359
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,230
So I can collect beer money
from the injured.

360
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:24,360
As a reporter,
I've met my share of swindlers.

361
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:26,070
But you're not one.

362
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:29,531
Well, what am I, then?

363
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,577
You're either very kind

364
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:37,665
or someone petty criminals like swindlers
can never measure up to:

365
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,292
someone lethal.

366
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:47,591
What are you filming?

367
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:52,054
Are you guys film extras?
I part-timed as one a couple times too.

368
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:54,723
But where's this truck headed?

369
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,851
-To a mine, of course.
-A mine?

370
00:32:57,935 --> 00:32:59,978
We're definitely not headed there.

371
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:05,234
I haven't heard a word from anyone
who left to earn money.

372
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,985
All gone without a single trace.

373
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:09,363
What happened to your forehead?

374
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:13,701
Oh, this? I was smacked
for saying I wanted to go home.

375
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:15,160
Smacked?

376
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:19,456
They assaulted an extra?
You should report them already!

377
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,625
To the Human Rights Commission!
Or just petition--

378
00:33:21,709 --> 00:33:23,210
Silence!

379
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:34,304
Shit, my arms are numb!

380
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,600
What the…

381
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:41,478
Geez, that bastard.

382
00:33:43,147 --> 00:33:44,648
Hold on.

383
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:48,777
Five o'clock? I slept for three hours?

384
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:59,538
This is the scene you all saw
at the beginning.

385
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:00,914
It's you.

386
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:01,999
Fast forward!

387
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:06,128
FAST FORWARD

388
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:38,952
You could have dodged it, right?
Why didn't you?

389
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:40,913
It was the only way you'd believe me.

390
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,290
About how sorry I am.

391
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,961
Now that you've defeated me,
let's call it even.

392
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:52,716
So don't waste your precious time
resenting me.

393
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,093
Quit being a bandit or whatever.

394
00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:00,265
Just find a bit of happiness, okay?

395
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,019
You speak as if you'll die soon.

396
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:07,356
-You can't die from this, right?
-I'm not dying.

397
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:10,818
But I have to go.

398
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:12,861
Where to?

399
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,283
Have a good life, you brat.

400
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,828
Show me what you've got.

401
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:37,302
Hey, you evil bastard.

402
00:35:37,386 --> 00:35:39,429
You say all you want
is just to leave again?

403
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:43,684
Why did you show up pretending to be nice
just to abandon me as you please?

404
00:35:46,687 --> 00:35:48,313
Who says I'm abandoning you?

405
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,457
Rang!

406
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,342
You okay?

407
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:22,890
You. Listen to me carefully.

408
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:30,105
Foxes always repay kindness
and repay their enemy, no matter what!

409
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,446
No, Rang. Wake up.

410
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:39,698
Myoyeongak.

411
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,700
Take me to Myoyeongak…

412
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:46,580
Rang-- Rang!

413
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,999
D-11 HOURS

414
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:56,465
Identification!

415
00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:00,177
Pass!

416
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:07,643
Aren't you that bitch from earlier?

417
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:13,148
You have the wrong person.

418
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:21,698
No one can fool me. Okay?

419
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,913
My identification is legitimate.

420
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,873
What's important isn't you.

421
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,626
I'm Jung Dae-seung of Jongno.

422
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,336
Do you know who I am?

423
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:36,588
Jung Dae-seung…

424
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,174
You hear how I deal with the likes of you?

425
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:42,427
You cut every bodily tendon…

426
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:47,140
I even got a medal for my torture skills.

427
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:49,810
Please spare me.

428
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:51,728
It really wasn't me.

429
00:37:54,523 --> 00:37:57,609
I swear on my dead parents
you have a gunshot wound on your shoulder.

430
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:01,405
You little shit!

431
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:08,120
-Don't move!
-No! No!

432
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:12,749
What the hell?

433
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:18,005
Ryuhei Kato,

434
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:20,340
government-general of Korea's
chief commissioner.

435
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,184
What are you doing?

436
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:35,063
I was investigating a suspect
in the bombing incident.

437
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:36,648
And who is this person?

438
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:39,234
She says she's a reporter
from the Seonwoo Daily.

439
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,319
I'll find out who's pulling her strings.

440
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:44,990
This woman is Seonwoo Daily.

441
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,871
-What?
-Her father is the head of Seonwoo Daily.

442
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:52,664
Sho Tawara.

443
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:55,959
Her mother is an aristocrat
of the Japanese Empire.

444
00:38:56,043 --> 00:38:57,669
Sho Tawara?

445
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:01,006
Do you mean Seon Woo-chang,
the richest man in Gyeongseong?

446
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:12,309
That's his daughter, Ginko Tawara.

447
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:14,436
She's also…

448
00:39:15,479 --> 00:39:16,646
my sister-in-law.

449
00:39:21,735 --> 00:39:24,696
My apologies, sir. I must've lost my mind.

450
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,990
-Please forgive me, miss.
-Get up.

451
00:39:32,746 --> 00:39:36,374
-Do you see the reason for my actions?
-Of course I do.

452
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:40,754
But that's too bad.
I have a habit of repaying my debts.

453
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:44,800
Cut his tendon, please.

454
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,384
The one on his right leg.

455
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:03,693
Goodbye, sir.

456
00:40:05,821 --> 00:40:07,322
I've had a good time.

457
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,200
MYOYEONGAK

458
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,461
Where is it? Where do I go, damn it?

459
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:25,966
Pardon me.

460
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:29,845
Geez.

461
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:34,766
Cheers to a lovely night!

462
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:37,394
Lovely!

463
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:48,363
I need to think.

464
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:51,158
Why did Rang want to come here?

465
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:53,785
Excuse me.

466
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:03,420
-Should I call a doctor?
-What is this place?

467
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:06,423
It's Gyeongseong's finest restaurant,
aside from Myongwolgwan.

468
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:08,633
-Is that all?
-Pardon?

469
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:10,594
Watch him for a second.

470
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:12,095
My goodness.

471
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:25,275
Hey.

472
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:30,906
You were an old man a moment ago, right?

473
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:35,619
Pardon me.

474
00:42:05,649 --> 00:42:07,067
It says "family."

475
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:10,779
I can live longer
if I sacrifice my daughter, right?

476
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,239
Father…

477
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,991
Is living a longer life

478
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,620
worth exchanging your child for?

479
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:21,998
Take her away.

480
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,417
So that…

481
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:26,836
is your choice.

482
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:08,253
Thank you, sir.

483
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:10,672
Thank you!

484
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:14,843
Father! Father!

485
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,344
Father!

486
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:18,722
Father…

487
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:29,774
Don't cry.
All that's severed are your worldly ties.

488
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:34,946
Now you will never have to cry again.

489
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,793
Who are you?

490
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,554
People call me this…

491
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:06,895
Long-Living Dong Bang-sak.

492
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:09,522
Dong Bang-sak…

493
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:12,359
The one with the longest life span
in Eastern tales?

494
00:44:14,361 --> 00:44:15,987
So that's why Rang--

495
00:44:17,447 --> 00:44:20,075
Hey, I'm glad I ran into you.
Let me borrow your life span.

496
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:23,953
Why would someone who isn't a mortal
desire my life span?

497
00:44:24,037 --> 00:44:25,705
My brother is dying.

498
00:44:25,789 --> 00:44:28,750
You must know, sir,
a deal with a demon comes with a price.

499
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:33,380
-That's why you made this rule?
-You shouldn't covet life so easily.

500
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:37,092
I usually make up the rules myself.

501
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:43,640
-Save my brother, this instant.
-Strike me.

502
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:47,685
If you do, you can have my life span.

503
00:44:56,486 --> 00:44:59,239
-What the hell is this?
-I can't even die as I please.

504
00:45:15,672 --> 00:45:17,507
Who are you? And where's Lee Yeon?

505
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:20,885
Can't you hear me?

506
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:30,562
What?

507
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:32,439
Am I dead?

508
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:37,819
Hey! Hey! Hey!

509
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,128
What's going on?

510
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:56,754
I have to find Lee Yeon.

511
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:19,360
Lee Yeon.

512
00:46:20,487 --> 00:46:21,571
Lee Yeon!

513
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,948
Hey!

514
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:33,541
So you want me to draw a ball
out of this box?

515
00:46:33,625 --> 00:46:37,212
If you bring me what you pick,
I'll trade my life span for it.

516
00:46:39,339 --> 00:46:42,675
-What are the choices?
-Things worth someone's life:

517
00:46:42,759 --> 00:46:45,470
money, fame, family, luck

518
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:48,014
and Uturi's sword.

519
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,141
Uturi?

520
00:46:50,225 --> 00:46:51,601
UTURI
THE LEGENDARY BABY GENERAL

521
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:52,977
Why the baby general's sword?

522
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:57,273
Because it's the only thing
that can cut me.

523
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:01,110
Are you perhaps…

524
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:03,071
trying to die?

525
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:05,532
All I have left is loneliness.

526
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:08,284
I've lived for thousands of years.

527
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:12,330
Everything I cared about,
and everyone who cared for me,

528
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:15,375
have vanished like dust.

529
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:21,506
All right.

530
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:23,883
Let's do it.

531
00:47:23,967 --> 00:47:26,261
What will it be?

532
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:30,223
How much longer will you take?

533
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:32,016
Shit!

534
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:34,394
Here.

535
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:38,982
UTURI'S SWORD

536
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:41,025
-The sword of Uturi.
-My goodness!

537
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:45,738
Hey, can't I trade it for something else?

538
00:47:45,822 --> 00:47:49,075
I know for certain it's
in the worst place possible in this era.

539
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:51,911
If you don't want my life span,
you may give up.

540
00:47:52,495 --> 00:47:53,496
Fine.

541
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:58,084
If I bring you the sword,
you promise to save my brother?

542
00:47:58,167 --> 00:47:59,419
Of course.

543
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,547
Fine. I'll go get it.

544
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:05,550
If by any chance

545
00:48:06,426 --> 00:48:08,595
my brother dies before I return,

546
00:48:09,429 --> 00:48:10,430
I'll cut you up.

547
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:28,615
Hey, can't you hear me?

548
00:48:28,698 --> 00:48:30,533
I'm here. I'm right behind you!

549
00:48:36,873 --> 00:48:37,999
Geez.

550
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:43,338
Damn it.

551
00:48:45,298 --> 00:48:46,299
Oh, goodness…

552
00:48:48,301 --> 00:48:49,844
-Hold on.
-Yes.

553
00:48:50,887 --> 00:48:52,430
Do I have a sinus problem?

554
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:54,015
Wow, you idiot.

555
00:48:55,016 --> 00:48:56,100
Why, you…

556
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:02,899
You'd always fall sick as a kid too.

557
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:05,443
Were you born just to torture me?

558
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:07,737
This bastard.

559
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:10,698
That's what you say to your dying brother?

560
00:49:11,783 --> 00:49:13,951
Please hang in there until I get back.

561
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:17,705
I will…

562
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:20,291
never give up on you.

563
00:49:49,529 --> 00:49:50,571
What's this?

564
00:50:15,388 --> 00:50:17,598
D-9 HOURS 20 MINUTES

565
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:19,851
Will I be able to save Rang in time?

566
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:24,814
GUNSAN

567
00:50:25,898 --> 00:50:27,316
The problem is this:

568
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,236
The creature wielding
the sword of Uturi in this era

569
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:32,822
happens to be me.

570
00:50:35,283 --> 00:50:36,284
Ah-eum.

571
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:39,495
Where in the world are you?

572
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,583
Why can't you be reincarnated?

573
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:51,841
What's wrong with him?

574
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,469
Well, that's embarrassing.

575
00:50:55,303 --> 00:50:57,680
Lord Lee Yeon! Lord Lee Yeon!

576
00:50:57,764 --> 00:50:59,766
Lord Lee Yeon!

577
00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:02,226
Kneel before him! I found them, sir.

578
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,897
You raccoons in disguise.

579
00:51:09,776 --> 00:51:10,943
I know of your sins.

580
00:51:11,027 --> 00:51:14,739
-What do you mean, "sins?"
-Your wife's name-- What is it?

581
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:16,908
-I'm Bae Ah-eum.
-Ah-eum.

582
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:18,201
Ah-eum!

583
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:20,787
-Who said you could use that name?
-Wait, wait-- Sir!

584
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:25,082
It's Lord Lee Yeon's first love's name,
who passed before her time!

585
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:28,252
-How should we know that?
-She'll change her name.

586
00:51:29,629 --> 00:51:32,548
You've no need to altercate
with Lord Lee Yeon!

587
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:33,716
What, you prick?

588
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,593
What'd you just say? Ah-eum-hate?

589
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:38,888
-Ah-eum-hate?
-No, altercate. Altercate, sir!

590
00:51:38,971 --> 00:51:41,265
-Alter--
-Come here. Come here.

591
00:51:43,518 --> 00:51:44,894
Hey, you!

592
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:47,480
What? Ah-eum-hate?

593
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:50,441
-How dare you?
-Lord Lee Yeon, that's enough!

594
00:51:50,525 --> 00:51:51,692
-Stop it.
-Ah-eum-hate?

595
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:53,945
-Just go, go.
-What's wrong with him?

596
00:51:54,904 --> 00:51:57,698
-Ah-eum-hate, huh?
-Sir, no!

597
00:51:57,782 --> 00:51:59,909
We all feel lost at times.

598
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:04,121
This is precisely one of my worst moments.

599
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:09,961
What the hell? I'm all out.

600
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:14,173
Lord Lee Yeon, please quit smoking opium.
You're already addicted!

601
00:52:14,257 --> 00:52:15,466
Hey.

602
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:18,719
If I don't do this…

603
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,347
I can't stop crying.

604
00:52:25,518 --> 00:52:28,563
Okay, just get some sleep.
I'll go find some more.

605
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:27,914
What's this?

606
00:53:28,915 --> 00:53:30,416
Was there always a mirror here?

607
00:53:49,185 --> 00:53:52,229
Man, why did Shin-ju put a mirror here?

608
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:05,409
Hey!

609
00:54:05,493 --> 00:54:08,788
-Die, you opium addict!
-I'm here to get revenge, you jerk!

610
00:54:09,664 --> 00:54:12,333
-Who the hell are you all?
-You struck me with lightning!

611
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:15,795
How could you break my leg
because my face displeases you?

612
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:18,506
I'm truly sorry, okay?

613
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:20,758
-I'm busy. Gotta go.
-You're going nowhere!

614
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:22,009
Hey, you!

615
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,682
Hey, retreat, retreat!

616
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:30,726
-You want another one, huh?
-Just you wait and see.

617
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:33,729
Damn, how tiring.
I should've lived a little more nicely.

618
00:54:33,813 --> 00:54:34,897
Lord Lee Yeon?

619
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:37,191
Shin-ju.

620
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:40,486
D-6 HOURS

621
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:50,371
Why are you doing this?

622
00:54:51,247 --> 00:54:52,331
What's going on?

623
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,007
What do you think you're doing?

624
00:55:10,725 --> 00:55:13,394
What if you'd choked her to death?

625
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:18,107
You can't let my precious food
vanish on me, can you?

626
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:19,316
What?

627
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:50,389
He wasn't sharing his life span.

628
00:55:51,307 --> 00:55:52,641
He was taking them.

629
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:55,561
I have to tell Lee Yeon.

630
00:55:58,773 --> 00:56:00,024
Wait a minute…

631
00:56:01,317 --> 00:56:03,194
-Can you see me?
-There you are.

632
00:56:15,623 --> 00:56:18,584
He can't see me. He can hear me.

633
00:56:25,091 --> 00:56:27,343
Darn. I lost him.

634
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:30,763
His body. Bring his body to me.

635
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:31,931
Yes, sir.

636
00:56:43,692 --> 00:56:44,860
You going somewhere?

637
00:56:44,944 --> 00:56:47,446
I'm going for a walk-- or stroll.

638
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:50,407
-I'll escort you out.
-No.

639
00:56:50,491 --> 00:56:53,536
I should go by myself…

640
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,454
to develop my independen--

641
00:56:55,538 --> 00:56:57,540
-You just go inside. Go inside.
-What?

642
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:12,471
Lord Lee Yeon, wake up! Lord Lee Yeon!

643
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:45,129
Don't you think the thunder
on your tail is a bit much?

644
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:48,174
How dare you disguise yourself as me?

645
00:57:48,257 --> 00:57:51,218
Besides, that's mine.

646
00:57:51,302 --> 00:57:53,762
Well, yes. It is.

647
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:56,974
Strictly speaking,
what's yours is mine and--

648
00:57:57,057 --> 00:57:58,058
Shut up.

649
00:57:58,142 --> 00:58:00,561
No one has ever touched what's mine

650
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:02,479
and survived.

651
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:05,316
I know. Better than anyone.

652
00:58:06,025 --> 00:58:09,153
But I'm a little busy right now.

653
00:58:42,061 --> 00:58:44,188
-Damn it! Oh, that head.
-That head.

654
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,701
What? You shit!

655
00:59:14,176 --> 00:59:15,511
Let this--

656
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:17,888
Oh, darn it!

657
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:30,359
Hey, you prick. This is called an arm bar.

658
00:59:30,442 --> 00:59:32,403
How's that? You didn't know, huh?

659
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:40,411
Hey, stop. You…

660
00:59:49,962 --> 00:59:51,046
You little prick!

661
01:00:00,431 --> 01:00:01,432
Ah-eum.

662
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:07,730
Ah-eum was reborn.

663
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:13,485
Where? Where is she?

664
01:00:15,988 --> 01:00:17,239
Oh, I think she's in…

665
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:18,949
Manchuria?

666
01:00:20,701 --> 01:00:23,120
I'll find you, Ah-eum.

667
01:00:28,459 --> 01:00:29,460
Ah-eum…

668
01:00:31,712 --> 01:00:33,922
I'm so sick of this.

669
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:37,926
D-4 HOURS AND 50 MINUTES

670
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:39,345
Will Rang be okay?

671
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:41,221
Please be okay.

672
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:02,576
What? Where did my body go?

673
01:01:16,924 --> 01:01:19,510
Find him, no matter what.

674
01:01:31,814 --> 01:01:33,190
Is anyone there?

675
01:01:41,824 --> 01:01:43,492
How may I help you?

676
01:01:43,575 --> 01:01:46,578
I'm looking for someone,
and I've only one room left to search.

677
01:01:46,662 --> 01:01:49,456
These are gisaengs' quarters.
Please leave.

678
01:01:55,421 --> 01:01:58,257
That's too bad,
because I must search this room.

679
01:02:02,344 --> 01:02:04,054
Are you sure?

680
01:02:04,138 --> 01:02:06,223
Even if I say I'll call Madam?

681
01:02:13,188 --> 01:02:16,150
Scour the place. I'm certain he…

682
01:02:17,526 --> 01:02:18,819
is here at Myoyeongak.

683
01:02:39,131 --> 01:02:41,300
Why is my body here?

684
01:02:43,594 --> 01:02:45,762
Are you sure we can do this?

685
01:02:47,556 --> 01:02:51,059
It's a customer's request.
And Madam gave us permission.

686
01:02:51,143 --> 01:02:55,647
If I'm not back by midnight, can you move
my brother to a different room?

687
01:02:56,523 --> 01:02:57,983
May I ask why?

688
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:01,320
I have a hard time trusting others.

689
01:03:07,159 --> 01:03:08,410
You ruthless bastard.

690
01:03:12,623 --> 01:03:14,166
I knew it.

691
01:03:20,047 --> 01:03:24,927
D-1 HOUR

692
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:36,188
-Did anything happen?
-Yes!

693
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:37,397
Nothing happened…

694
01:03:38,524 --> 01:03:39,775
at all.

695
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:42,152
-Tell him the truth!
-Thanks.

696
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:55,958
No! Don't fall for it!

697
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:01,755
What do I do? What…

698
01:04:04,049 --> 01:04:05,175
Damn it!

699
01:04:24,987 --> 01:04:26,738
You can see me, huh?

700
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:32,369
Really? You can see me?

701
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:34,162
Mister, are you a ghost?

702
01:04:35,706 --> 01:04:39,084
-How come only you see me?
-My grandma is a shaman.

703
01:04:42,754 --> 01:04:45,257
THE PRESENT

704
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,259
-Is Yeon back?
-Not yet.

705
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:49,970
Time's almost up.

706
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:52,806
Where in the world is that punk?

707
01:04:55,142 --> 01:04:56,226
Hurry.

708
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:58,228
You must hurry, Yeon.

709
01:05:03,025 --> 01:05:04,026
Open the door!

710
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:09,406
Damn it!

711
01:05:13,994 --> 01:05:16,246
-Where's the sword?
-Here.

712
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:19,416
-We have a deal.
-Wait.

713
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:22,669
-You cheated, right?
-What do you mean?

714
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:25,422
This raffle box.

715
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:27,883
-You messed with it.
-Not a chance.

716
01:05:29,718 --> 01:05:31,762
There were a total of 44 marbles in there.

717
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:37,601
But every single one had
"Uturi's sword" written on it.

718
01:05:38,769 --> 01:05:40,228
Do I look like a fool?

719
01:05:40,312 --> 01:05:43,523
If you knew, why did you get the sword?

720
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:45,108
Same reason as you.

721
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:48,779
Because it's the only thing
that can kill me?

722
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:51,281
You lied about wanting to die, right?

723
01:05:51,365 --> 01:05:53,075
You wanted to destroy this sword.

724
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:55,494
I've been living forever
off of humans' life spans.

725
01:05:56,745 --> 01:05:58,163
What of those you made younger?

726
01:05:59,331 --> 01:06:01,833
It's a simple trick.
They age back in three days.

727
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:04,711
But by then, I won't be here.

728
01:06:05,587 --> 01:06:06,922
You brat.

729
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:11,593
-But still, you can't kill me.
-Why not?

730
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:18,308
Because your brother is my hostage.

731
01:06:24,231 --> 01:06:25,941
What do I do?

732
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:27,025
25 MINUTES LEFT

733
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:28,443
I don't have time.

734
01:06:28,527 --> 01:06:31,530
If I don't kill him now
and jump into the cabinet…

735
01:06:32,406 --> 01:06:35,200
All right. Let's see who dies first.

736
01:06:49,548 --> 01:06:50,632
Oh, shit.

737
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:54,928
What went wrong?

738
01:06:57,973 --> 01:06:59,975
I've lived longer than you for a reason.

739
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:27,586
He's one of the Ten Longevity Symbols:
a leatherback turtle!

740
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:30,046
Don't be ridiculous.

741
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:32,632
You think I don't know
they're working with him?

742
01:07:32,716 --> 01:07:36,136
I'm Lee Rang. I borrowed this body.

743
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:39,014
Stop that nonsense!

744
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:45,604
How can I tell him
that my soul borrowed this girl's body?

745
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:57,991
There's no salvation for those
who don't try to save themselves.

746
01:07:58,575 --> 01:08:00,994
Whether you live as a human or a fox,
it's your choice.

747
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:03,455
But remember one thing, kid:

748
01:08:03,538 --> 01:08:07,417
There's no salvation for those
who don't try to save themselves.

749
01:08:11,296 --> 01:08:12,798
Turtle, turtle.

750
01:08:13,465 --> 01:08:14,591
Give me your head.

751
01:08:15,175 --> 01:08:17,928
If you don't,
I'll roast you and eat you up.

752
01:08:19,387 --> 01:08:20,555
Turtle, turtle.

753
01:08:21,306 --> 01:08:25,185
Give me your head.
If you don't, I'll roast and eat you up.

754
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:26,728
Turtle, turtle.

755
01:08:26,812 --> 01:08:28,647
Give me your head.

756
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:32,234
If you don't,
I'll roast you and eat you up.

757
01:08:32,317 --> 01:08:35,320
Turtle, turtle. Give me your head.

758
01:08:35,403 --> 01:08:38,740
If you don't,
I'll roast you and eat you up.

759
01:09:51,855 --> 01:09:53,148
Kill him!

760
01:10:14,628 --> 01:10:16,296
-Oh, goodness!
-My gosh!

761
01:10:19,466 --> 01:10:21,217
-Oh, my shoulder.
-My legs!

762
01:10:21,301 --> 01:10:22,761
-Oh, my, my.
-Oh, gosh.

763
01:10:34,606 --> 01:10:39,819
THE GATE OF TIME HAS CLOSED

764
01:10:51,915 --> 01:10:55,794
Remember, it's by the Hour of the Tiger.
Return before the door closes.

765
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:15,438
Ji-ah must be waiting.

766
01:11:51,975 --> 01:11:53,935
Dong Bang-sak is dead?

767
01:11:58,231 --> 01:12:00,900
What a shame.
He was quite the money-maker.

768
01:12:02,402 --> 01:12:04,529
-Let's do this later.
-Yes, ma'am.

769
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:11,870
By the way, is Lee Yeon still handsome?

770
01:12:14,289 --> 01:12:17,500
I've spent hundreds of years
chasing after him.

771
01:12:19,878 --> 01:12:21,171
You get what I'm saying?

772
01:12:22,047 --> 01:12:23,298
I understand, ma'am.

773
01:12:24,883 --> 01:12:25,884
Then…

774
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:29,846
bring me the largest and prettiest one.

775
01:12:33,141 --> 01:12:35,268
We haven't seen each other in a long time.

776
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:44,087
Someone has locked me in the past.

777
01:13:45,547 --> 01:13:47,382
However, they know nothing.

778
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,927
In an era without a woman to protect,

779
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:54,597
the nine-tailed fox
is far more ruthless than they'd expect.

780
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:01,771
It's time to hunt.

781
01:14:06,609 --> 01:14:11,239
TALE OF THE NINE TAILED

782
01:14:35,388 --> 01:14:37,765
Long time no see, fox.

783
01:14:39,642 --> 01:14:42,687
What exactly is your relationship
with that crazy woman?

784
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:44,147
You, be mine.

785
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:48,484
I'll make him mine,
even if I have to kill and taxidermy him.

786
01:14:49,194 --> 01:14:51,654
Only beautiful women are targeted.

787
01:14:51,738 --> 01:14:54,949
Once we solve this case,
we can catch the guy who stabbed you.

788
01:14:55,033 --> 01:14:56,284
Will you seek revenge?

789
01:14:56,367 --> 01:14:59,078
I'm not sure.
Should I help Lee Yeon or him?

790
01:14:59,162 --> 01:15:00,371
Who are we?

791
01:15:01,206 --> 01:15:03,791
A fox always pays his debts.
