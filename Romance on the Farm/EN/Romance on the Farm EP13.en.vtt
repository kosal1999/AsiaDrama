[This drama comes with BM subtitles]

01:29.500 --> 01:35.160
[Romance on the farm]

01:35.830 --> 01:37.910
[Episode 13]

02:06.960 --> 02:07.650
good.

02:08.949 --> 02:10.259
Mrs. Zhang, I'm back.

02:10.259 --> 02:10.949
of.

02:12.060 --> 02:12.710
I'll come back first.

02:14.790 --> 02:16.410
Mrs. Zhang, there’s a lot of wine.

02:38.380 --> 02:38.829
that's right.

02:39.390 --> 02:40.110
Put a little more.

02:51.770 --> 02:53.110
Shen Nuo, get another bucket of water.

03:09.220 --> 03:09.850
wheat,

03:11.240 --> 03:12.080
Where did dad go?

03:12.100 --> 03:13.150
Why don't you see him?

03:13.860 --> 03:14.500
Isn't he

03:15.170 --> 03:16.050
to make

03:16.579 --> 03:17.390
wine distillation equipment

03:17.390 --> 03:18.420
For you?

03:19.980 --> 03:20.860
I forgot because I was busy.

03:22.100 --> 03:22.579
It doesn't matter.

03:23.700 --> 03:26.090
Tam, let's milk it quickly.

03:26.530 --> 03:27.370
So there is Brother Heng

03:27.410 --> 03:28.320
Can ferment more.

03:34.410 --> 03:35.020
Let me do it.

03:44.470 --> 03:44.950
Mali.

03:59.390 --> 03:59.980
man,

04:00.860 --> 04:01.700
Shen Nuo left.

04:02.390 --> 04:03.650
What are your future plans?

04:06.660 --> 04:08.020
What do you mean?

04:08.540 --> 04:10.250
Just one less person to chat with.

04:10.650 --> 04:11.440
Fewer and fewer people offer ideas

04:11.590 --> 04:12.660
One less person to talk business with, right?

04:13.210 --> 04:14.180
No big deal.

04:18.140 --> 04:19.010
I can help you.

04:21.250 --> 04:22.330
You always help me.

04:23.250 --> 04:24.070
I mean,

04:24.680 --> 04:25.790
I can help you more.

04:28.400 --> 04:28.960
quote,

04:29.470 --> 04:29.990
blush,

04:30.540 --> 04:31.020
Fermentation.

04:31.670 --> 04:32.700
Doesn’t all this require manpower?

04:35.030 --> 04:35.900
Thank you Brother Heng.

04:38.170 --> 04:39.850
But you're not cut out for all of this.

04:41.020 --> 04:41.530
you

04:41.780 --> 04:43.390
Study your medical books carefully.

04:44.110 --> 04:45.060
if i really need help

04:45.390 --> 04:46.270
I will tell you

04:49.150 --> 04:50.540
How do you know I'm not suitable?

04:51.080 --> 04:52.870
I can do everything Shen Nuo can do.

04:56.150 --> 04:56.780
OK

04:57.700 --> 04:59.340
I will take you to a place tomorrow.

06:02.460 --> 06:04.160
If the herbal collector says so

06:04.460 --> 06:05.910
There is indeed a bandit stronghold nearby,

06:06.690 --> 06:08.030
It feels like it's close.

06:09.270 --> 06:10.110
we don't know yet

06:10.150 --> 06:10.780
About the situation there.

06:11.580 --> 06:12.670
If you are in a hurry to go there

06:13.140 --> 06:14.080
Success may not be easy.

06:14.790 --> 06:15.660
Looking for help?

06:16.710 --> 06:17.250
No need to rush.

06:18.090 --> 06:19.270
Berdasarkan sikap Yu Xiangjin,

06:20.550 --> 06:21.350
He cannot be fought with violence.

06:22.060 --> 06:23.180
He grabbed the balance book

06:23.700 --> 06:24.350
because he remembers

06:24.390 --> 06:25.440
This spreadsheet is very useful.

06:25.860 --> 06:26.810
He could get something with it.

06:28.180 --> 06:28.950
Let's go investigate first.

06:30.110 --> 06:30.740
maybe we really can

06:30.760 --> 06:31.680
deal with him.

06:32.230 --> 06:32.710
hurry up.

06:45.340 --> 06:46.300
It feels like this is the place.

06:49.810 --> 06:50.720
There are many doormen here.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.680
Let’s take a look around first.

06:54.290 --> 06:55.020
We split up.

06:55.150 --> 06:55.820
OK

07:23.460 --> 07:25.100
Isn't this my brother and your brother?

07:25.150 --> 07:26.090
Look, we're here

07:26.110 --> 07:26.760
There are many destinies.

07:26.780 --> 07:27.810
Let's meet soon.

07:27.900 --> 07:28.460
correct?

07:28.890 --> 07:30.540
Don't pretend to be close to us.

07:30.900 --> 07:32.440
If you two don't cause trouble

07:32.580 --> 07:33.760
We transferred gold, silver, calligraphy and paintings

07:33.780 --> 07:34.770
From Song Mansion to here.

07:35.380 --> 07:36.450
Why do you say that?

07:36.590 --> 07:37.880
Didn’t we get that too?

07:37.900 --> 07:39.350
Our stuff, right?

07:39.530 --> 07:40.560
According to your situation,

07:41.150 --> 07:42.460
You're waiting for us here, right?

07:42.920 --> 07:44.280
Our leader said,

07:44.640 --> 07:45.770
He took your stuff

07:46.030 --> 07:47.140
You will definitely come to him.

07:47.659 --> 07:48.780
Whether you can find it or not,

07:49.159 --> 07:50.400
Depends on your ability.

07:51.030 --> 07:51.700
Didn't expect that

07:53.080 --> 07:54.390
You can really come to Black Tiger Castle.

07:54.909 --> 07:56.020
Okay, let's go.

07:57.390 --> 07:58.100
please.

09:09.490 --> 09:10.010
go ahead.

09:10.390 --> 09:11.750
The leader is ahead.

09:17.340 --> 09:17.950
faster.

09:18.220 --> 09:19.230
Come quickly.

09:20.580 --> 09:21.750
Everyone, relax.

09:26.820 --> 09:27.570
Run slowly.

09:28.100 --> 09:28.830
Don't fall.

09:31.180 --> 09:31.940
So beautiful again.

09:38.280 --> 09:38.870
Main leadership.

09:39.860 --> 09:40.340
Bro, isn't it?

09:42.190 --> 09:42.860
Eldest sister, eldest brother.

09:44.100 --> 09:44.820
Bro, isn't it?

09:47.740 --> 09:48.640
You can really find it here.

09:51.460 --> 09:52.340
Hello, Director Yu.

09:53.870 --> 09:54.920
How are you two doing?

09:55.220 --> 09:56.350
Can you find it here?

10:02.950 --> 10:03.870
Quite smart.

10:04.710 --> 10:05.360
Ketua Yu.

10:05.820 --> 10:07.130
Why are there so many frail old women and children?

10:07.250 --> 10:08.010
In this fortress?

10:08.330 --> 10:08.740
Why?

10:09.400 --> 10:10.530
you really feel it

10:10.820 --> 10:12.420
Is this a bandit den?

10:18.950 --> 10:20.280
most people here

10:20.760 --> 10:21.710
They are all ordinary people

10:21.750 --> 10:22.590
Who is homeless.

10:23.530 --> 10:25.530
Some people's fields were robbed

10:25.570 --> 10:26.290
noble lord

10:27.380 --> 10:28.780
Some of their families are in trouble

10:29.040 --> 10:29.900
until losing identity

10:30.070 --> 10:31.100
and family registration information.

10:31.470 --> 10:33.110
They go up the mountain because they don't know where to go.

10:34.350 --> 10:35.250
finally,

10:35.300 --> 10:36.580
everyone gathers here

10:37.100 --> 10:37.590
and form

10:37.630 --> 10:39.060
black tiger fort

10:39.710 --> 10:40.340
What you see now.

10:41.100 --> 10:41.580
so,

10:42.460 --> 10:43.470
Why are you

10:43.510 --> 10:44.580
Pretending to be a troupe and robbing someone on the street?

10:45.300 --> 10:46.050
What's wrong with robbing someone on the street?

10:46.640 --> 10:47.480
we robbed

10:47.500 --> 10:48.760
Rich businessman who makes excessive profits

10:48.800 --> 10:49.560
and corrupt officials.

10:49.580 --> 10:50.420
we never

10:50.440 --> 10:51.300
Even ordinary people are grabbing it.

10:51.980 --> 10:52.400
You two can see for yourselves.

10:52.420 --> 10:53.110
Where is this place?

10:53.490 --> 10:54.750
This is a very poor place.

10:55.340 --> 10:56.830
If sister doesn't arrange for us

10:56.850 --> 10:57.960
Go down the mountain and rob a little bit,

10:58.490 --> 10:59.480
There are so many people here,

10:59.620 --> 11:00.360
Do you want to support them?

11:09.940 --> 11:10.710
You came on time.

11:11.950 --> 11:13.110
Come together you two.

11:18.970 --> 11:20.060
This is easy to manage.

11:20.310 --> 11:21.680
Take action when they come.

11:23.530 --> 11:24.050
Where is this place?

11:24.490 --> 11:25.210
This is a government road.

11:25.940 --> 11:27.310
There are always government soldiers standing guard there.

11:27.830 --> 11:28.860
There are also government soldiers patrolling.

11:29.350 --> 11:30.820
I'm telling you, it's too dangerous to continue acting.

11:31.340 --> 11:31.740
that's right.

11:32.350 --> 11:33.320
If so, we act now

11:33.340 --> 11:34.910
Government troops do not patrol.

11:34.940 --> 11:35.820
Doesn't this work?

11:36.300 --> 11:37.430
Why am I afraid of the government?

11:37.860 --> 11:39.350
I really want to defeat the government!

11:39.580 --> 11:40.500
The boss of this business team

11:40.520 --> 11:41.680
An escort agency was established.

11:41.700 --> 11:42.560
People were taken out

11:42.580 --> 11:43.950
Surely everyone is good at fighting.

11:44.070 --> 11:44.430
wait,

11:44.470 --> 11:45.400
We need to talk again.

11:45.520 --> 11:46.870
You are a coward.

11:47.140 --> 11:47.870
Who is Black Tiger Fort afraid of?

11:47.900 --> 11:49.010
You are a coward!

11:49.030 --> 11:50.210
Should Black Tiger Fortress be afraid of him?

11:50.250 --> 11:51.000
Go...to the side.

11:51.070 --> 11:51.740
What does this have to do with you?

11:51.760 --> 11:52.850
you are stupid.

11:52.870 --> 11:53.740
Who are you calling stupid?

11:53.740 --> 11:54.640
I said you are stupid.

11:54.680 --> 11:55.390
You are a fool.

11:59.830 --> 12:00.580
Everyone shut up!

12:10.500 --> 12:11.110
Bro, isn't it?

12:12.350 --> 12:12.830
here

12:13.520 --> 12:14.810
It's a great place for action.

12:14.950 --> 12:15.420
OK

12:15.880 --> 12:16.670
Everything looks good.

12:16.860 --> 12:17.370
OK

12:17.580 --> 12:18.670
As soon as Boss Hu comes out

12:18.710 --> 12:20.310
Appear from here...

12:21.210 --> 12:22.010
Andak, Art.

12:22.180 --> 12:22.580
of.

12:22.600 --> 12:23.800
You're blocking their way out

12:24.190 --> 12:25.310
From the right rear direction.

12:25.430 --> 12:26.060
- OK.
- OK.

12:26.230 --> 12:26.820
Yasue,

12:27.600 --> 12:28.610
You were here then.

12:28.940 --> 12:29.950
Well, leave it to me.

12:30.430 --> 12:31.480
It's obviously Yu Xiangjin

12:31.630 --> 12:32.200
knew we were coming

12:32.220 --> 12:33.310
Take a balancing book,

12:33.710 --> 12:34.800
But he said nothing.

12:35.500 --> 12:36.510
Instead, he asks us to listen

12:36.530 --> 12:37.410
They planned to rob in the street.

12:37.870 --> 12:38.900
Do you know why?

12:39.570 --> 12:40.100
certainly.

12:40.350 --> 12:42.160
Of course they want to be nice, let's see.

12:44.680 --> 12:45.980
He is observing our attitude

12:46.290 --> 12:47.560
Let’s see if we are allies.

12:48.060 --> 12:49.230
Does everyone understand?

12:49.300 --> 12:50.180
- Understood!
- Understood!

12:50.500 --> 12:51.900
Everyone must concentrate when the time comes!

12:51.970 --> 12:52.950
OK

12:54.630 --> 12:55.310
for.

12:56.460 --> 12:58.480
This unscrupulous trader

12:58.520 --> 13:00.030
Who deliberately robbed your property?

13:00.430 --> 13:01.710
And cause your family to break up.

13:02.340 --> 13:04.460
In a few days, you will

13:04.990 --> 13:05.770
Lead us!

13:06.100 --> 13:06.630
cannot.

13:18.580 --> 13:19.340
brothers and sisters,

13:20.330 --> 13:21.170
I want to say something.

13:22.820 --> 13:23.660
a few more days,

13:23.690 --> 13:24.950
Boss Hu, you know how to rob?

13:25.300 --> 13:26.250
Be a member of an escort agency.

13:26.590 --> 13:27.800
He is very capable.

13:28.500 --> 13:29.670
If you really fight him

13:30.580 --> 13:31.840
In addition to being able to grab things,

13:32.570 --> 13:33.200
On the contrary, it is easier for you

13:33.220 --> 13:34.400
suffered serious losses.

13:35.110 --> 13:35.950
both sides of the road

13:35.980 --> 13:37.070
Suffering such serious injuries,

13:37.470 --> 13:37.970
in my opinion,

13:39.840 --> 13:40.570
useless.

13:40.700 --> 13:42.550
Are you saying my sister is useless?

13:42.760 --> 13:44.080
- I'll rip your mouth off.
- well.

13:46.690 --> 13:47.320
Let him speak.

13:50.470 --> 13:51.370
I can help you

13:52.340 --> 13:53.430
solve this matter

13:54.540 --> 13:55.490
Sacrifice no one.

13:57.990 --> 13:59.750
Really, sister?

14:00.950 --> 14:02.210
Don't brag.

14:06.330 --> 14:07.170
Ketua Yu.

14:07.820 --> 14:09.770
Since you knew we were coming,

14:10.220 --> 14:11.620
Anyway, you let us hear about your robbery on the street.

14:12.500 --> 14:13.700
You're testing our attitude, aren't you?

14:14.820 --> 14:15.930
You want to see it too

14:16.350 --> 14:17.650
Can we give you an idea.

14:18.140 --> 14:18.830
in this case,

14:19.630 --> 14:20.870
I don't want to hide anymore

14:22.460 --> 14:23.810
I hate corrupt officials too

14:24.180 --> 14:25.450
and wealthy businessmen who plunder the interests of others.

14:26.620 --> 14:27.920
I am willing to do my best to help Director Yu.

14:28.490 --> 14:29.270
As for the method,

14:30.000 --> 14:31.160
I have a good idea.

14:31.980 --> 14:33.470
The condition is that after success,

14:34.060 --> 14:35.360
I want my ledger back.

14:39.230 --> 14:39.830
Ketua Yu.

14:40.820 --> 14:41.470
main leaders,

14:42.400 --> 14:43.220
Do you have any opinion?

14:59.830 --> 15:00.340
main leaders,

15:01.110 --> 15:02.500
The backgrounds of the two boys are unclear.

15:03.090 --> 15:04.540
Leave this important matter to them,

15:05.340 --> 15:06.220
Not safe.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.230
He deliberately arranged thirteen

15:10.250 --> 15:11.320
Join our opera company.

15:12.060 --> 15:13.700
He also introduced me to the subordinates of the Song family

15:14.540 --> 15:16.890
Then we can perform at the Song House

15:17.500 --> 15:18.990
And help him sneak into the residence.

15:20.570 --> 15:22.060
After sneaking into Song Mansion,

15:22.830 --> 15:23.740
He didn't get a penny.

15:24.700 --> 15:25.990
He just took the book.

15:27.830 --> 15:29.300
It doesn't feel easy.

15:31.850 --> 15:33.460
Coincidentally, we can take advantage of this opportunity

15:34.100 --> 15:35.350
Check his background.

15:58.460 --> 15:59.720
It’s been a long time since I went up the mountain to collect herbs.

16:00.060 --> 16:00.580
but i didn't notice

16:00.580 --> 16:01.740
This is a thermal pool cave.

16:05.710 --> 16:06.230
man,

16:06.780 --> 16:08.380
We grow leafy greens.

16:08.860 --> 16:10.230
But, winter is coming.

16:10.940 --> 16:11.680
Can it be done?

16:12.830 --> 16:14.660
As long as the temperature and humidity are right.

16:16.130 --> 16:17.790
I don't even know if it will work.

16:18.460 --> 16:19.180
try it.

16:20.410 --> 16:21.530
Okay, let's try it.

16:28.690 --> 16:29.450
elder sister!

16:30.830 --> 16:31.250
elder sister.

16:33.420 --> 16:33.860
Why?

16:34.300 --> 16:34.820
Laojin...

16:35.430 --> 16:36.440
Uncle Lao Jin said...

16:36.820 --> 16:37.470
Speak slowly.

16:38.310 --> 16:39.190
Uncle Jin said

16:39.590 --> 16:41.820
He has told the villagers

16:42.240 --> 16:43.460
You and brother Youheng

16:43.710 --> 16:44.740
Will get married.

16:46.420 --> 16:47.110
what else?

16:47.340 --> 16:49.590
He said the date had been set.

16:49.760 --> 16:51.800
Wait until you two hug each other in three years.
(Meaning to have two children within three years)

16:54.340 --> 16:54.950
elder sister,

16:55.430 --> 16:56.990
What is "Two Hugs in Three Years"?

17:01.940 --> 17:03.120
Meaning, a guy named Tiga

17:03.670 --> 17:04.670
Another one named Dua

17:05.069 --> 17:05.980
Embrace

17:07.910 --> 17:09.380
What happens after the hug?

17:11.710 --> 17:12.280
Then...

17:12.300 --> 17:12.990
For that reason.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.619
It feels like there are crickets in it.

17:15.980 --> 17:16.710
Go find it.

17:21.750 --> 17:22.260
man,

17:23.310 --> 17:24.109
sorry.

17:24.950 --> 17:26.750
I think it's because my father saw us both

17:26.770 --> 17:27.740
We are always together these days

17:28.140 --> 17:29.060
And then my father said this.

17:29.860 --> 17:30.620
But if this matter

17:31.180 --> 17:32.400
scattered in the village,

17:32.660 --> 17:33.430
Your reputation will be damaged.

17:34.340 --> 17:36.060
I'll explain it to him now.

17:36.180 --> 17:36.710
Brother Heng.

17:37.380 --> 17:39.460
Shisanli Village is actually not big.

17:39.740 --> 17:41.270
After everyone chatted,

17:42.070 --> 17:44.150
In less than two hours, word of the incident spread throughout the village.

17:45.010 --> 17:45.780
Let them chat.

17:46.460 --> 17:47.510
Don't be angry with Uncle Jin

17:47.550 --> 17:48.580
because of this.

17:49.710 --> 17:50.430
you do not mind?

17:51.230 --> 17:51.940
This is not true,

17:51.980 --> 17:52.970
Why do I care?

18:05.320 --> 18:06.160
Brother Heng.

18:07.700 --> 18:09.170
I've been having a problem.

18:11.220 --> 18:11.900
Why Uncle Jin?

18:12.630 --> 18:14.080
Not letting you study medicine?

18:16.940 --> 18:17.740
I don't know either.

18:19.250 --> 18:21.540
I've asked him several times.

18:22.310 --> 18:23.140
He just said,

18:23.850 --> 18:24.330
Compared to becoming a doctor,

18:24.940 --> 18:26.310
Working in a bank is lucrative.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.130
finally,

18:28.700 --> 18:29.940
I don't even argue with him anymore.

18:30.720 --> 18:32.120
I secretly read medical books

18:32.630 --> 18:34.230
And treat the villagers well.

18:35.230 --> 18:36.120
If Uncle Jin

18:36.140 --> 18:36.940
It's fun to disagree,

18:37.710 --> 18:38.680
you can

18:38.700 --> 18:39.840
Keep doing it secretly.

18:40.550 --> 18:42.150
Don't you want to own your own medical center?

18:45.990 --> 18:46.660
Definitely want it.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.770
But what I have learned now

18:50.230 --> 18:51.470
Just the basics.

18:52.630 --> 18:53.510
Still far

18:53.950 --> 18:54.810
rather than proficiency.

18:56.950 --> 18:57.800
This is better

18:58.780 --> 18:59.710
If one day,

19:00.500 --> 19:01.390
I can become a student of a famous doctor

19:02.230 --> 19:03.320
openly

19:03.950 --> 19:04.790
And study medicine seriously.

19:07.250 --> 19:07.940
Obviously,

19:08.260 --> 19:09.060
Brother Heng

19:09.100 --> 19:10.610
There are admirable teachers.

19:12.020 --> 19:13.030
Gao Yang dari Beichuan,

19:13.440 --> 19:14.600
He Zhixiang dari Lingnan.

19:15.570 --> 19:16.600
They all come from famous medical families.

19:17.180 --> 19:18.950
Dr. Hu from Imperial Medical Center

19:19.220 --> 19:20.710
He is an expert in traditional Chinese medicine.

19:21.470 --> 19:23.230
But it’s hard to meet

19:23.660 --> 19:24.640
Famous therapists like them

19:25.060 --> 19:25.960
No recommender needed,

19:26.810 --> 19:27.730
Not to mention treating me as a student.

19:29.070 --> 19:29.980
Now that you have a goal,

19:30.780 --> 19:31.700
What do you mean to try?

19:32.770 --> 19:34.140
Maybe you will succeed.

19:36.970 --> 19:37.750
This is it, Brother Heng.

19:38.460 --> 19:39.030
you

19:39.370 --> 19:40.900
Read a book in this cave.

19:41.260 --> 19:42.330
No one messes around here.

19:42.710 --> 19:44.180
After all, this place is backed by a mountain.

19:44.540 --> 19:45.480
maybe you can find it

19:45.500 --> 19:46.510
Many traditional herbal medicines.

19:48.150 --> 19:48.670
OK

19:49.320 --> 19:50.100
If I read here

19:50.630 --> 19:51.800
I can also help you take care of your vegetables.

19:51.990 --> 19:52.790
Drink water while diving.

19:54.300 --> 19:55.180
Thank you Brother Heng.

20:07.050 --> 20:07.830
This cave,

20:07.850 --> 20:08.990
I need to take advantage of it too.

20:09.870 --> 20:10.500
You must help me.

20:13.340 --> 20:13.990
promise me.

20:17.700 --> 20:18.840
Wrap your little finger and make a promise.

20:18.880 --> 20:19.800
It won't change in a hundred years.

20:19.810 --> 20:21.090
If it changes, that person is a fool.

20:43.710 --> 20:44.780
Let's eat.

20:54.260 --> 20:55.200
Tan, remember.

20:55.700 --> 20:56.630
Then there were only four people eating.

20:56.940 --> 20:57.700
In our house.

20:58.290 --> 20:58.730
elder sister,

20:58.940 --> 21:00.910
Where has Brother Shen Nuo gone?

21:01.900 --> 21:02.550
My sister doesn't know.

21:03.390 --> 21:04.000
Come and eat.

21:06.940 --> 21:07.470
Maner.

21:08.430 --> 21:09.300
Actually it's been a long time

21:09.680 --> 21:10.720
I want to ask you.

21:11.140 --> 21:11.940
Shen Nuo ini

21:12.260 --> 21:13.900
Leave without even saying goodbye.

21:14.510 --> 21:15.750
Is something happening?

21:17.220 --> 21:17.990
He has grown up,

21:17.990 --> 21:18.900
what happens?

21:19.270 --> 21:19.950
after all,

21:20.470 --> 21:21.710
He has nothing to do with me.

21:22.070 --> 21:23.460
We have no control over where he goes.

21:26.630 --> 21:27.700
Can't say that.

21:28.790 --> 21:30.870
Shen Nuo ini

21:31.730 --> 21:33.030
Nominally your mother's nephew.

21:33.480 --> 21:34.360
even your grandparents

21:34.670 --> 21:35.620
I asked him where he was

21:35.980 --> 21:36.940
repeatedly.

21:38.010 --> 21:39.310
He has been living with us for a long time.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.770
He is also half a member of the Lian family.

22:02.950 --> 22:03.300
Oh,

22:04.420 --> 22:04.980
mark.

22:05.620 --> 22:06.220
sorry.

22:07.550 --> 22:08.540
All that's left is about Shen Nuo.

22:10.030 --> 22:10.990
Already worried you

22:13.470 --> 22:13.980
Maner.

22:15.010 --> 22:16.730
Actually, mom and dad

22:16.980 --> 22:18.050
Don't worry

22:18.090 --> 22:18.770
Because Shen Nuo left.

22:19.730 --> 22:20.550
reason

22:21.500 --> 22:22.420
After he left,

22:23.030 --> 22:23.950
Man'er, not always

22:23.970 --> 22:24.790
smile again

22:31.540 --> 22:32.740
In this life,

22:34.020 --> 22:34.860
There must be something for a man

22:35.230 --> 22:36.370
incomprehensible

22:36.790 --> 22:38.780
And overcome it mentally.

22:39.790 --> 22:40.460
but,

22:41.810 --> 22:43.530
When rice grows in the fields,

22:43.870 --> 22:44.540
This live broadcast

22:44.940 --> 22:46.450
Must continue as usual.

22:46.980 --> 22:47.940
three meals a day

22:48.130 --> 22:49.960
You also need to eat as usual, right?

22:50.190 --> 22:51.330
After all, our wine

22:51.540 --> 22:52.540
Do you still need to continue?

22:52.860 --> 22:53.470
correct?

22:53.910 --> 22:54.390
of.

22:54.650 --> 22:56.950
So, anyway,

22:57.460 --> 22:58.430
We must look forward.

23:04.430 --> 23:05.060
Why?

23:11.300 --> 23:12.140
there is nothing.

23:13.510 --> 23:14.540
I just don't think so

23:14.900 --> 23:15.500
my father

23:15.820 --> 23:17.460
So many facts can be told.

23:24.580 --> 23:25.590
Let's eat.

23:25.780 --> 23:26.550
Eat a little more.

23:26.700 --> 23:27.140
Mom, thank you.

23:27.540 --> 23:28.610
Finally I see you smiling.

23:34.750 --> 23:35.310
This is enough.

23:37.860 --> 23:38.950
Eat a lot, Tan.

24:07.430 --> 24:07.790
WHO？

24:18.750 --> 24:19.220
brother?

24:20.880 --> 24:22.390
what are you doing here?

24:24.740 --> 24:25.250
I...

24:28.230 --> 24:28.780
Just pass by here.

24:29.990 --> 24:30.480
Just pass by here.

24:31.860 --> 24:32.220
no.

24:32.910 --> 24:33.860
A room on the east side,

24:34.220 --> 24:35.240
A room on the west side.

24:35.790 --> 24:37.030
Can you pass by here too?

24:40.310 --> 24:40.870
Just pass by here.

24:41.760 --> 24:42.200
Just pass by here.

24:49.630 --> 24:50.350
Obviously,

24:51.020 --> 24:51.630
us

24:52.260 --> 24:53.630
Be careful in the future.

24:54.150 --> 24:55.200
many people want it

24:55.220 --> 24:56.000
Our house wine.

24:56.550 --> 24:57.070
It doesn't matter.

24:57.430 --> 24:58.080
That

24:58.100 --> 24:59.300
Just a jar for fermenting wine.

24:59.510 --> 25:00.430
It's not over yet.

25:00.750 --> 25:02.150
This final secret procedure...

25:06.780 --> 25:07.220
no.

25:07.450 --> 25:08.290
Why did dad run away?

25:11.380 --> 25:11.990
Yes

25:12.200 --> 25:12.720
He was scared when he found out

25:12.740 --> 25:13.900
how you make wine,

25:13.980 --> 25:15.010
He can't keep secrets.

25:15.220 --> 25:16.860
Forced by your grandmother, she continues to reveal secrets.

25:17.450 --> 25:18.620
It would be better if he didn't know.

25:26.330 --> 25:27.760
If so, don't tell him.

25:28.030 --> 25:28.980
Yes.

25:32.470 --> 25:34.230
He was supposed to run so fast.

26:54.370 --> 26:55.950
Finally, the distillate is ready.

26:56.490 --> 26:56.810
Mali,

26:57.310 --> 26:58.640
Check out the barrel your father made.

26:58.660 --> 26:59.450
See how it turns out.

27:23.910 --> 27:24.640
first fermentation period

27:24.660 --> 27:25.380
too short.

27:26.030 --> 27:26.990
Texture is affected.

27:27.790 --> 27:28.460
Let me try.

27:34.180 --> 27:34.660
child,

27:35.020 --> 27:36.240
Why do I taste this wine?

27:36.260 --> 27:36.950
Is it delicious?

27:37.270 --> 27:38.090
Let me try.

27:43.150 --> 27:43.690
how?

27:45.270 --> 27:46.220
I really don't understand,

27:46.610 --> 27:48.250
But I think it's pretty good.

27:48.700 --> 27:49.370
That's very good.

27:50.710 --> 27:51.720
I've got a bit of a handle on it

27:51.740 --> 27:52.790
The fermentation period of the wine.

27:53.570 --> 27:54.340
This group of wine

27:54.700 --> 27:55.980
It will ferment quickly.

27:56.470 --> 27:57.310
OK

27:57.430 --> 27:58.740
Mom, I want to try it too.

28:00.120 --> 28:01.680
Just smell it and you'll know.

28:05.520 --> 28:06.800
He still felt dizzy after inhaling.

28:07.710 --> 28:08.460
Apparently the alcohol content of this wine

28:08.500 --> 28:09.320
enough

28:09.990 --> 28:10.410
child,

28:10.630 --> 28:12.660
Did you name this drink?

28:12.830 --> 28:14.340
This wine is distilled from grape juice.

28:14.740 --> 28:15.600
Shouldn't it be called?

28:15.620 --> 28:16.460
Distilled liquor?

28:16.950 --> 28:18.060
cannot.

28:18.380 --> 28:19.110
Try to think about it.

28:19.130 --> 28:21.210
例如，Arak Merah Johan 和 Arak Merah Puteri。

28:21.680 --> 28:22.750
The name of each wine

28:22.770 --> 28:23.500
too delicious

28:24.030 --> 28:24.510
so,

28:24.530 --> 28:26.320
If you want this wine to sell,

28:26.630 --> 28:28.310
Must have a good name.

28:29.470 --> 28:30.390
make sense.

28:31.230 --> 28:31.700
that's right.

28:32.430 --> 28:33.460
What should this wine be called?

28:35.220 --> 28:36.550
Brandi?

28:50.470 --> 28:51.060
how?

28:56.990 --> 28:57.660
Is alcohol a problem?

28:58.540 --> 28:59.230
there is a question.

28:59.990 --> 29:02.180
And, this is a very big problem.

29:03.980 --> 29:05.470
Very good.

29:07.320 --> 29:08.350
That's very good!

29:08.420 --> 29:11.140
This wine is really good.

29:11.940 --> 29:14.340
But around this area,

29:14.360 --> 29:15.660
never existed

29:15.830 --> 29:16.670
Arak brandy.

29:17.220 --> 29:17.910
feel like

29:18.730 --> 29:19.630
Hard to sell

29:20.470 --> 29:21.230
Regarding the issue of selling alcohol,

29:21.270 --> 29:21.980
I've already thought about it.

29:22.380 --> 29:22.990
Sir, listen.

29:25.510 --> 29:27.130
Now the district examination is approaching,

29:27.870 --> 29:29.710
We named this wine

29:29.990 --> 29:31.310
Brandi Red John

29:31.650 --> 29:32.570
And make it famous.

29:32.990 --> 29:34.040
I came up with a slogan.

29:34.570 --> 29:35.950
After drinking John's wine,

29:36.020 --> 29:37.340
It must be johan in the test!

29:37.680 --> 29:38.770
This is a good idea.

29:39.150 --> 29:40.280
Whenever regional exams are approaching,

29:40.430 --> 29:41.230
everyone is fighting

29:41.270 --> 29:42.820
Buy asparagus porridge,

29:42.910 --> 29:43.900
Pig's trotter book (pronounced the same as pass), etc.

29:43.980 --> 29:45.620
Just to get good luck.

29:45.990 --> 29:46.810
that's right.

29:46.980 --> 29:48.160
After buying John's wine,

29:48.310 --> 29:49.060
We give Kuih Johan.

29:49.100 --> 29:50.180
This means good things come in pairs.

29:50.180 --> 29:51.420
I bought three big jars,

29:51.500 --> 29:52.860
Give a small jar.

29:52.890 --> 29:54.460
We also offer financial aid for education.

29:54.500 --> 29:56.580
I gave another bowl of Bubur Lulus

29:56.600 --> 29:58.350
There are also some side dishes.

29:58.390 --> 29:59.290
we also give

29:59.310 --> 30:00.450
bowls, plates,

30:00.490 --> 30:01.440
settings or other.

30:01.160 --> 30:02.670
[Restoran Fuchun]

30:03.180 --> 30:04.020
Eventually it was sold.

30:04.460 --> 30:05.700
Soon, I will make a profit of 1,000 gold coins.

30:30.110 --> 30:31.580
I feel something is wrong.

30:32.130 --> 30:32.670
group.

30:33.110 --> 30:34.020
Turn left onto the government road.

30:34.230 --> 30:35.590
There are government soldiers patrolling the roadside.

30:35.630 --> 30:36.470
This is safer.

30:36.850 --> 30:37.900
but we need it

30:37.920 --> 30:39.060
It will take at least one day and one night to cross the mountain.

30:39.230 --> 30:40.720
If the road ahead is straight, we can take a shortcut.

30:40.950 --> 30:41.540
Very short trip.

30:42.020 --> 30:43.220
But compared with before,

30:43.470 --> 30:44.620
Thieves always show up.

30:44.830 --> 30:46.450
There are so many of us, what are we afraid of?

30:46.620 --> 30:47.140
that's right.

30:47.710 --> 30:48.620
In this area,

30:48.640 --> 30:49.880
Who doesn't face us?

30:50.320 --> 30:51.200
then,

30:51.220 --> 30:52.100
We used to help magistrates

30:52.120 --> 30:53.260
Destroy the castle seven or eight times.

30:53.660 --> 30:54.860
At that time we were using attacks...

30:54.860 --> 30:57.420
help!

31:02.250 --> 31:03.720
What will happen in the future?

31:03.990 --> 31:05.300
There are robbers on the highway.

31:05.570 --> 31:07.140
Then run away quickly.

31:07.160 --> 31:07.690
hurry up!

31:07.790 --> 31:09.470
Come on, let's go!

31:10.150 --> 31:11.660
What do we say about taking shortcuts?

31:15.020 --> 31:15.740
heartless.

31:16.410 --> 31:17.350
I support you in vain.

31:17.370 --> 31:18.280
It's all useless!

31:18.820 --> 31:19.540
You follow the ways of heaven.

31:20.230 --> 31:21.660
If you see a robber, stop him!

31:22.080 --> 31:22.750
You go too!

31:23.210 --> 31:24.220
Others carry things

31:25.380 --> 31:26.260
Take the shortcut with me.

31:28.680 --> 31:30.040
What are you afraid of? I'm here.

31:30.100 --> 31:31.150
Come on, come on, let's go.

31:42.140 --> 31:43.020
Come on, come on.

32:07.900 --> 32:08.550
Trapped.

32:24.510 --> 32:25.250
brother,

32:25.790 --> 32:27.680
I know you are a kind person.

32:25.880 --> 32:27.980
???When I open it???

32:28.020 --> 32:30.310
???My blood is burning???

32:29.300 --> 32:30.600
can you let me go?

32:30.920 --> 32:34.170
???After the smoke clears, what is the battle? ? ?

32:31.210 --> 32:33.520
I am willing to pay this amount.

32:35.270 --> 32:37.980
? ? ? This is me? ? ?

32:37.890 --> 32:39.740
agree.

32:38.380 --> 32:40.100
???After going through the challenges???

32:40.290 --> 32:42.740
???Use instinctive movements???

32:42.910 --> 32:43.460
attack!

32:42.930 --> 32:46.320
???Hide a huge attack barrier???

32:44.990 --> 32:45.710
brother!

32:46.340 --> 32:48.440
? ? ? I have no limits? ? ?

32:46.440 --> 32:48.020
Don't run!

32:48.770 --> 32:51.130
? ? ? Cross this level? ? ?

32:49.890 --> 32:51.520
brother!

32:51.150 --> 32:52.740
? ? ? try best? ? ?

32:51.710 --> 32:52.430
Do not move!

32:52.760 --> 32:54.650
???This is the belief I strive for???

32:54.320 --> 32:56.040
- Let me go!
- Do not move!

32:54.800 --> 32:57.260
???When your destiny is put to the test???

32:56.800 --> 32:57.910
Listen here, friends!

32:57.280 --> 32:59.380
???Bring my desire???

32:58.140 --> 32:59.300
Take and plunder what is due!

32:59.400 --> 33:01.610
? ? ? Fight to the end? ? ?

33:01.500 --> 33:02.050
brother,

33:01.630 --> 33:05.180
???Come back after the challenge???

33:02.910 --> 33:04.190
You read it wrong.

33:11.380 --> 33:13.180
Boss Hu is indeed weak.

33:13.330 --> 33:14.420
When we draw our swords

33:14.590 --> 33:16.350
He kept peeing because he was scared!

33:18.180 --> 33:19.380
I tell you,

33:19.420 --> 33:21.900
This time it's Brother Shen's service.

33:22.910 --> 33:24.900
Brother Shen, you are such a handsome guy

33:24.930 --> 33:25.680
it's great

33:26.310 --> 33:27.550
He pointed there with his finger,

33:27.700 --> 33:29.190
And five fingers.

33:29.710 --> 33:30.810
Boss Hu still remembers

33:30.830 --> 33:32.070
He succeeded

33:32.260 --> 33:34.020
This is not good for you, try saying it!

33:34.860 --> 33:35.740
How bad you are!

33:38.660 --> 33:40.370
Even sir can't see...

33:40.390 --> 33:43.010
who is my brother

33:44.170 --> 33:45.990
Use tactics to lure the enemy,

33:46.310 --> 33:48.140
Then the tactics confuse the enemy.

33:48.500 --> 33:49.020
at last,

33:49.420 --> 33:50.360
Causing enemies to fall into traps.

33:50.370 --> 33:51.350
No one was killed,

33:51.390 --> 33:52.910
Keep catching enemies!

33:54.020 --> 33:55.030
great!

33:55.030 --> 33:55.990
Let's drink together!

33:56.020 --> 33:56.770
Let's drink together!

33:56.980 --> 33:57.700
Mali!

33:57.930 --> 33:58.410
Already very happy!

33:58.540 --> 34:00.380
Come and drink!

34:00.470 --> 34:02.190
Come on, hurry up!

34:04.460 --> 34:05.300
Mali!

34:06.940 --> 34:08.330
You are really talented.

34:08.889 --> 34:10.800
Before that, we didn't know, we didn't love.

34:11.449 --> 34:13.370
We became friends from now on.

34:13.850 --> 34:14.420
friends.

34:20.870 --> 34:22.110
this is my pride

34:22.610 --> 34:23.739
Because you can be appreciated by the leader.

34:25.550 --> 34:26.900
What I promised before...

34:30.150 --> 34:31.889
This fort has rules.

34:32.900 --> 34:34.350
This time counts

34:34.770 --> 34:36.199
Brother Shen gave us a reunion gift.

34:37.100 --> 34:38.550
It was just a little theft.

34:39.750 --> 34:41.409
not enough to change

34:41.980 --> 34:43.110
Something my boss promised, right?

34:45.860 --> 34:46.870
you mean

34:48.090 --> 34:49.080
Do you want to break your promise?

34:49.980 --> 34:51.469
Our leader is shy.

34:52.170 --> 34:53.530
Some things were not suitable for him to say.

34:54.179 --> 34:55.460
So, I would say.

34:59.100 --> 35:00.270
what is the point

35:01.430 --> 35:02.560
Do you want that thing?

35:08.150 --> 35:08.930
I want to use this thing

35:09.600 --> 35:10.720
Just to get cash for a cow.

35:11.340 --> 35:12.020
I think

35:13.780 --> 35:15.400
It's not easy, right?

35:38.590 --> 35:39.540
Mali!

35:40.100 --> 35:41.030
Today is a happy day.

35:41.240 --> 35:43.490
We just have a drink and don't talk about anything else.

35:44.260 --> 35:44.770
Mali.

35:46.990 --> 35:47.770
Brother Shen,

35:48.460 --> 35:51.090
I'm very impressed

35:51.190 --> 35:52.220
Brave people like you.

35:53.860 --> 35:54.530
What is the word?

35:54.930 --> 35:55.980
Do you want to stay here for a few more days?

35:56.630 --> 35:58.500
Let's have a nice drink and chat.

35:58.670 --> 36:00.500
Coincidentally, some of my people are leaders

36:00.610 --> 36:02.410
You can also come to us for guidance.

36:03.270 --> 36:04.470
Let's drink.

36:05.580 --> 36:06.550
Mali.

36:07.900 --> 36:09.470
Come on, Brother Shen,

36:09.980 --> 36:10.580
Saudara Thirteen.

36:11.150 --> 36:12.310
Just stay here.

36:12.620 --> 36:13.860
Tomorrow I

36:13.880 --> 36:15.310
Take you to try soy sauce roasted pork leg

36:15.350 --> 36:16.020
di Restoran Yuefeng.

36:16.470 --> 36:17.280
Really too fat
