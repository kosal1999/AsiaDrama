WEBVTT

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.360
hey

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.320
Hahahahahahaha laugh at it

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.720
Hey, the date of this wedding is too tight.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.560
if not

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.360
It’s more expensive if my mother decides to go out and dress you.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.160
It's a pity to think about it

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.560
Just those new fabrics

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.000
I didn’t even have time to make some more clothes for you.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.160
Oh my mother, Liu Fu doesn’t lack these at all.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.600
Keep it for yourself and make nice clothes.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.480
Good-looking, good-looking

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.600
Oops

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.840
Listen to my brother

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.960
My sister-in-law is getting married, right?

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.320
look at this

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.240
They are all new girls

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.200
Your sister-in-law was so scared that she was so scared that you looked at her a lot.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.600
That would be the case too

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.000
Haha, I have something that I don’t mean to say.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.960
Oh, tell me quickly.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.960
My dear sister-in-law

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.320
Can't answer

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.800
What are you talking nonsense about?

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.640
You don't like my sister-in-law, right?

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.000
Where do you start talking about this?

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.200
Tell the truth

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.720
This is Liu Fugui’s family

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.200
He doesn't have a son

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.560
Lianmai, forget it if you like to meddle in other people's business.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.240
You even have to take care of my marriage

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.760
How can you not see me like this?

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.440
I just think that this matter has some time to think about

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.000
That’s why I came to remind you

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.040
Yes, yes, I think my sister is right.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.720
This important wedding event should not be taken too hastily.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.600
How about we ask around first?

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.840
The boss also said that he would pass at 15.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.720
I think it's a bit too rushed

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.200
It's better to figure it out. Oh daddy.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.360
You agreed to this marriage

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.320
You said you would go and inquire now

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.200
What if someone from the Liu family finds out?

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.480
I thought we couldn’t trust people

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.480
What should I do if it messes up the marriage?

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.760
that is

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.800
Tell me, if there is no Mr. Liu, who is this person?

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.000
Do you think Liu's Mansion is a small courtyard?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.920
How many people are there in the family?

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.400
How is it possible to explain this clearly to ordinary people like us?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.960
Moreover

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.680
This is the beauty that my eldest brother has guaranteed to me personally.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.000
Can't Big Brother destroy us?

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.400
My sister-in-law is so guarded against others.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.760
You don’t even know An Niang

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.080
I will marry this husband Liu Xiu

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.240
It’s not easy to agree on such a marriage

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.280
Let's talk about this big family.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.680
listen

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.520
Who would mess up this marriage for me casually?

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.560
I'm not done with him

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.320
Okay, let's go, let's go

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.720
Grandma is gone. It’s too urgent. Shut up.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.440
Go back and rest, shut up

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.440
go back

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.680
Then sit down and be obedient

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.040
don't listen to him

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.680
Then you are lying to your parents and Xiu.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.960
Who is Mr. Liu?

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.520
The government has to give him some thin noodles.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.160
Is this what he said?

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.440
In our family, we have to marry even if we are showing off.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.280
Even if you don’t want to marry, you have to marry

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.080
The implication

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.600
It's not a matter of whether I lose my official position or not.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.320
If you don't say it, you'll lose your life.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.680
Then this gold foreign company

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.920
We can't forgive you

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.040
I have difficulty with the left side

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.160
I dare not say a word no to Boss Liu

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.880
Our parents here need to know how to sit down with their sleeves bent

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.520
He can't nod either.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.400
blindness

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.880
It can only be a lie

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.800
You said that if you knew about this show

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.680
He must not make trouble

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.040
Then if you don't want to get married later,

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.040
Mr. Liu, I can’t control that much anymore.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.960
As long as it's before getting married

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.880
There was no failure in this matter

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.880
As soon as the person was carried into Liu's house

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.560
I'll do the job

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.120
But he still has to know after he goes in

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.440
You said Xiuer him?

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.680
Can we start from this point, people with brains are alive, right?

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.880
Once married to the Liu family

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.040
After a few good days, he will naturally think about it.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.960
Hey, Mr. Liu said it

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.280
Just show off and get married

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.000
Luxurious food and clothing

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.560
Popular and spicy drinks

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.680
Hey, I think this is not a bad thing.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.560
Oh, may the Buddha bless you.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.640
Don't go on any business trip, okay, okay, okay

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.680
Stop being so verbose.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.240
How much money does our family have?

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.000
You can't take away all that verbosity, right?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.680
This may not be high

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.720
Anyway, give Xiu some points.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.680
It's Liu Jiaju who he wants to marry

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.800
In case things slip up, hey

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.440
I don’t think he hates me that much.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.560
This this

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.080
This, this, this

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.400
What's going on?

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.320
I'm helping you in front of Fifth Master

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.040
Said a lot of good things

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.920
Master Liu, I'm already in there

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.000
Those with seals

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.240
Don’t rush in and take a look at this errand.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.880
optimistic

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.480
Why not salt?

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.320
go inside

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.800
Everything is here

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.120
Boss Cao

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.240
Just follow the route on this map

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.600
Send the goods over

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.240
Be sure to pay attention to safety on the road

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.880
After taking you to the place

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.600
Take this jade sign

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.520
Someone will come to pick up the goods

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.040
If you save it and come back, you have to return it to me.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.400
Feel free to leave a message

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.560
One more thing I want to remind you

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.560
Never open the box

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.120
What should and should not be done?

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.480
I have my own sense of proportion

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.800
why it should be a wild cat running around

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.520
Once it’s done, my next cup of tea will still be yours.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.120
Can't handle it well

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.600
Song Haikun is a good example

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.840
I understand

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.360
The boss in this business

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.320
Everyone is staring at this big deal that Wu Ye rewarded

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.080
Please rest assured Mr. Liu

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.680
I definitely don't experience any fatigue

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:40.800
It's eating iron ore

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.520
Eat iron ore

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.880
Hematite is a rare stone used for forging weapons.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.720
Moreover, the imperial court strictly prohibited the folk temples with four colors

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.080
Why did this middle-aged man send grass?

00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.920
Is it possible that I would rather lean back?

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:00.720
That's right

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.160
The only way to circumvent the imperial court is to seize the heavyweights privately.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.080
Mining and breaking weapons

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.240
I would rather be Hou Langzi

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.080
Afraid of rebellion

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.840
I thought that Jingyang Company was only involved in reselling Siyan

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.240
I didn’t expect to resell Siyan

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.040
just a layer of smoke

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.200
Boss Cao is not a delivery person at all.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.120
It's his middle-aged five-year-old mine transporter

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.320
Mingxiu plank road

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.600
Darkness Chencang

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:29.880
OK

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.760
It's enough for you to think deeply about it

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.080
It would have been like this a long time ago

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.040
We should continue to follow Boss Cao

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.000
Go and have a look at the garrison station behind Ningyuan.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.720
Don’t look at it if our Wood Temple breaks into the military camp without permission

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.000
was discovered

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.160
He also knows how to kill green snakes

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.760
It's more difficult to stab in the back

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.920
So what should we do in the hot summer?

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.320
If you can escape

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.400
Once he does, the military consequences will be disastrous

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.960
Would rather the queen is powerful

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.200
If there is no governance

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.560
It would be difficult for officials to punish him publicly

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.520
This is urgent

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.960
We still have to start from this unparalleled experience

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.880
Only found the mine

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.560
Only then do you have a chance to find the municipal government

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.640
What's wrong

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.440
sad-faced

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.760
But have you settled the matter for your sister-in-law?

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.160
what happened

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.320
Where are the collaborators?

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.960
Promised marriage to his sister-in-law

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.520
The person to be married is Liu Fugui’s son

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.160
But you also know how Liu Fugui has a son.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.200
Your uncle is really quite capable.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.040
Hui Hui cheats his own family

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.840
Grandma is not very thoughtful

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.160
Since you have advised me

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.640
There's nothing they can do if they don't listen.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.280
Let's play demon chess

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.200
yes

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.000
It's not safe. They blame you for being nosy.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.000
You were right

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.800
My little sister-in-law has hit the south wall.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.560
at this point

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.560
can only hope for things

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.560
Not as bad as I thought

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.560
What about after marrying into the Liu family?

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.560
It can't be like home.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.360
You have to pay more attention to everything

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.040
Wait until the Liu family

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.840
Don't get off the sedan in a hurry

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.280
Don't rush into the house either

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:11.040
Wait until you finish spreading the beans, mother.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.680
I'm all about to get married.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.200
Not a child anymore

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.720
Are you in your mother's eyes?

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.760
Always a little girl hum

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.840
You said you were going to get married soon

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.200
Mother

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.000
I just married into the town

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.520
Not far from our home

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.120
We can still walk around each other when we have time.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.400
Can the Liu family allow you to come and go as you please?

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.200
I am Mrs. Liu Jiashao

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.440
Don't talk about walking around

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.200
Even if I take your two elders to live here,

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.440
That won't be a problem either

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.920
That’s my daughter, she’ll be Mrs. Shao, look.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.800
Come on hahahaha

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.360
up

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.360
A little higher, a little higher would be better

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.280
congratulations

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.200
Your family is very happy today, hahahaha

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.560
Is it behind?

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.440
Why

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.760
Xipo, all the bridesmaids are here.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.800
Where is the groom?

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.240
Oh right

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:13.360
My senior officials are waiting for their daughter-in-law at home.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.640
Ha ha

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:19.880
this

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.640
oops

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.600
Where is this groom's official?

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.040
You can't see the groom for the first time. Oops.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.040
This happy day

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.440
Guys, please don’t misunderstand and get angry, haha

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.240
We definitely don’t mean to neglect the girl.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.200
just because of mom

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.840
Although our family is not a big one,

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.360
But there should be no lack of rules in a married family.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.880
If the groom doesn’t come, we won’t get married.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:48.920
Hello

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.520
Our small door and small household

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.840
Who knows the rules of a wealthy family?

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:55.880
perhaps

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.280
Is there something particular about it?

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.280
Or do masters and servants know better?

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:02.880
This is not like the previous one

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.080
My senior official went to Taiyi Temple to find the Taoist Priest.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.600
I took a look at the horoscopes

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.760
The Taoist priest said

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.080
Our girls

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.920
Is born to be rich and auspicious

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.040
Hahaha

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.920
That's for sure, haha, but that's it

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.640
What a coincidence

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.440
It just so happens that my family is a high-ranking official.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.520
He is too old this year

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.520
I'm afraid I'll bump into the girl

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.560
This happy event is not beautiful

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:32.440
So Zhuo Laoshen brought him to the house to welcome the bride.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.600
Haha, but don’t worry, everyone

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.400
My high-ranking official has not expressed his sincerity

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.080
Except for betrothal gift

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.680
In addition, several boxes of gold and silver silk and satin were presented.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.560
Haha come and see

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.800
Hahaha

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:47.960
Hahahaha oops

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:52.360
So much, oh, that’s a lot of money, hahahaha

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.840
Silently

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.440
Although the gift from this noble lady is expensive,

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.360
But my sister-in-law is also the apple of the family’s eye.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.200
How could the marriage be so hasty?

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.280
It’s better to invite Mr. Liu to come and pick up the bride.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:07.880
Man is right

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.680
This matter has nothing to do with gold, silver and satin

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.880
We don't sell our daughters

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.160
That

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.920
Grandma has made it very clear

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.880
You, a junior, are still contradicting your elders here

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.040
Can you bear the thought of missing your sister-in-law’s time?

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.280
Isn’t it?

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.240
Our Liu family is a big and respectable family.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.120
Can you still praise the girl?

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.040
Haha, don’t worry, guys

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.480
Our senior officials have said

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.120
Waiting for the return home

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.400
I will also prepare a big gift

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.240
Send it to the girl's house

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.160
simply ridiculous

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.600
Okay, stop talking.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.320
You junior

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.520
Talking about elders

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:50.880
Is this true?

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.920
Ah, that's right

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.800
Look at how many betrothal gifts they have given me

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.720
Which girl from all over the country can compare with me?

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.920
Did you look at what I said?

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.360
Don't delay, hurry up, mother.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:09.120
Serve tea hahahaha

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.040
Recompense from confidants

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.080
Thank you dad for your years of upbringing.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.120
Waiter

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.560
You don’t have to stay at home after you get married

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:47.200
These four words, virtuous and kind, must never be forgotten.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.680
Hope your husband will raise your son

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.200
Peace and happiness for a lifetime

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.360
Daughter urgently asks for advice from father

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.280
you know hey

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.000
daughter in law

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.720
Mom has nothing to say

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.360
It would be nice to get married

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.200
Mom feels at ease

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.240
Mom, take care of yourself too

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.280
My daughter will get married now

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.160
The auspicious time has arrived

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.760
The bride comes out of the cabinet

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.240
Just get married like this

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:20.880
ah

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.480
Hibo

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.200
Have you seen this Mr. Liu?

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.240
You are a friendly person who is easy to get along with.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.200
Mr. Liu is a kind man.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.000
He's a very easygoing person

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.960
I promise to love you very much, my wife, from now on.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.040
Hahaha

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.720
Isn’t this spirit going to spread its bones?

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.480
What kind of bones are you throwing away?

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.240
Wow, these are the rules of a wealthy family.

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.480
It’s really different from our village.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.480
Oh right

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.080
I haven't worshiped yet, so why should I go to the bedroom first?

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.960
Just stay here for now

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.760
You should let me rest here first.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.160
oops

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.280
who are you

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.800
Who are you marrying now?

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.720
who am I

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.800
You're not that eh

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.800
The one I want to marry is Young Master Liu.

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.320
what are you doing here

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.000
Let you be Liu Pu directly

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.560
Grandpa’s legacy is not better

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:35.600
ah

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:39.160
ah ah me you

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:41.360

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:45.720
ah

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.480
at my place

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.320
Where do you want to run?

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.440
Don't come here

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.800
Come here again

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.960
I will die for you

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:15.920
Ahhh

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.120
Ahhh

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:20.360
ah

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.680
Ahhh

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.640
Ah ah ah ah help people

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.200
Ahhh

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.040
let me go

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.080
I won't go, I don't love

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.360
I don't I don't refuse

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.680
Let me go and save my life

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:42.200
Help, let me go

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.120
Just a country girl

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.120
I got so many benefits from me

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.160
Still pretending in front of me

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.760
Stay here for me

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.840
Think it over before you go out.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.840
Lock me up, right?

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:03.800
Grandpa, don’t send people over there to cause trouble.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.280
I want your mistress to come over quickly

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.680
Hmm hmm

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.200
Fifth Master is so late

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.080
What's the emergency if you take my place?

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.240
sit

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:10.960
What's wrong with the hand?

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.080
Oh, Wu Yuan, you are laughing.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.920
Xin Na's concubine has a bit of a fierce temper

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.600
I just taught you a lesson.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.920
Shangfeng gave instructions from the heart

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.600
Said our shipment was too slow

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:30.920
to speed up progress

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.560
Are you so urgent all of a sudden?

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:45.480
May

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.680
It's not that we are lazy

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.200
Our current mining route

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.160
But just to avoid the crowd

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.320
I took the mountain road that loops northwest

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.840
Come down this time

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.320
Say less for half a month

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.080
don't speed up progress

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:08.280
Then we can only go to the eastern front where there are many people.

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.760
But there is no way to avoid the villages there.

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.200
Just this thing

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.960
Don’t avoid people’s eyes and ears anymore

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.520
What if this is revealed?

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.960
But it's a big deal

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.640
If there is no one here

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:45.040
There is no need to avoid it

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.360
What does Wu Ye mean?

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.560
Bring people in the guild

00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.280
Call everyone

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:00.920
clear

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.720
right here

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.160
Mr. Wu, you plan to move the area east of Jinyang County

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.600
Buy everything within a 20-mile radius.

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.440
That's a house thirteen miles away

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.200
Hutao Xingsheng and other dozens of villages

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.840
Mr. Wu is really a generous person.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.640
What kind of deal is this?

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:28.280
How about using such a big place?

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.640
Mr. Wu invites everyone here today

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:38.000
I just want to see who can take the initiative to acquire land.

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:44.200
Several villages in this area of ​​Wuye

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:47.800
Where have the villagers here lived for generations?

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.160
Let these people take them away

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.920
sell you the village

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.040
Easier said than done

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.880
Even if we have these

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.600
There's no such benefit

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:01.680
Dare to ask Mr. Wu

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.240
What will you use it for after you collect it?

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.320
You just need to reply to me

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.640
Can you please take this matter down?

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:20.720
No need to ask anything else

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:30.240
Who can handle this matter?

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.240
next cup of tea

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.160
It's also his

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.600
Hmm, that's a good thing

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.600
Boss Zhang, why don't you give it a try?

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.800
I want to kill Wu Yan

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.520
I am willing to serve you

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:55.360
good

00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:00.040
Then let me see what the boss is capable of.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:02.880
Wait for my good news

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.560
Can any young person be qualified?

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.000
Should you do it, or should I do it?

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.000
We are ready to transform our industry

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.200
Dad, let's think about it carefully.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.320
You go and fight for one like this

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:21.680
if i don't go

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.440
Someone will still go

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:29.480
Only when you become a new spouse will you have the opportunity to receive airdrops.

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.560
It's easy for us

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.760
Is it just to drink this cup of tea?

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:35.960
What do you think?

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:37.400
Report from the balcony

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:39.920
After all, that is Miss Lian’s home.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.800
But I would feel uncomfortable if I knew

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.320
So you can’t help but love

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:56.800
oops

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.000
yeah

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.040
Come on, what are you doing?

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.840
Wait for your sister-in-law to come back.

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.360
You said this has been going on for three days?

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.360
Mom

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.080
Is there anything going on?

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.280
Uncle

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.160
Hey, come here

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.120
Mother

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:54.000
You guys are chatting here

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:57.000
Xiu, why didn't he come back?

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.880
Ah, maybe she just got married

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.040
Busy etiquette

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:03.320
I'll come to see you after I finish my work in a few days

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.120
Let's talk in the house

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:08.080
I have to finish such a big thing before returning home.

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:10.400
This Liu Fu doesn’t really understand you, tell me.

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.880
Children answer questions on everything

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:15.160
This is all the elders' business. Why are you meddling in it?

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.880
Go get water

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:21.480
Mom, please don’t interrupt me and your old man.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.000
Give me a chance

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.800
But when will the show come back?

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.680
Didn't I tell you?

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.880
I'll come back and see you after you're done with these few days.

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.200
Hey mother, watch this movie

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.440
The Liu Mansion gave it to me. Oops.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:34.560
These are all good things

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:35.240
People have said

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.640
When I came back, I brought all the gifts back.

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:40.800
The Fulin Party is obedient and returns to duty

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.120
It’s not a waste of money

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:45.720
This gift house is really nice to us.

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:48.200
Can't stand the grievance hahaha

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:55.520
Why

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.600
Delivering food, yes

00:32:58.600 --> 00:32:59.840
Shopkeeper Ai Lin

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.680
Why haven’t I seen Boss Shen come to the restaurant recently?

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.880
Okay, does he want anything else?

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.040
Do you have anything to do with him?

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:10.120
Er, this is what he promised to boss Jing Yanghang before

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:12.960
The food delivered is for Mr. Cao, who runs the shop.

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.880
This is for Boss Liu’s house

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.480
This is Boss Liu’s dish

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.720
I'll go with you to see him off, okay

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.520
This is the shopkeeper's

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:47.880
Hey stop stop stop stop

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.240
What are you doing

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:51.320
one move

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:54.160
First, the restaurant guy comes to deliver hot spring vegetables to Boss Liu.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.080
How did I not hear it being said

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.680
Then I need the boss to send a message.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.240
Yeah, boss

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:23.960
It's from North Korea, right?

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:26.480
Yes, this is our shopkeeper

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:30.680
One look at the girl and it turns out she is not a servant doing menial work.

00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:33.000
It turns out that the head shopkeeper is here.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:36.840
I need Lao Lian, the shopkeeper, to go there in person. Big brother is here to see me

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:40.360
Our boss Shen and Liu Ye were traveling together in Jingyang.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.400
Just some side dishes

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.920
It's nothing hahaha, take it to the kitchen

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.800
Yes, wait a minute

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.840
Just put this dish here.

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.120
I'll ask them to come and move it in a while

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:53.160
Don't go in any further

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:01.240
Hey, our tourist resort is really weird.

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:05.640
Your courtyard is better than other ordinary courtyards hahaha

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:09.360
Hey, I heard that our tourist office has a happy event recently.

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:12.400
Can I ask for some wedding candy from my eldest brother to cheer you up?

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.360
happy event

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.240
Um

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:18.880
Oh hi this is

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.360
Oh, what kind of happy event is this? Uh-huh.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:25.560
Isn't it just that my grandpa married another woman outside?

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.360
The little girl is just back

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.000
Not surprised anymore

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:32.360
puss

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:38.360
That's the one who infiltrated on the 5th.

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:46.280
I just want there to be something happy for our Liu family

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.400
You must be inviting people from the guild to a wedding banquet.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:52.600
It doesn't look like a serious affair

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.480
Hahaha, that’s why

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.680
Why would my master do such a thing?

00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:57.680
There's a big banquet

00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.680
Right? Well, what's more?

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:05.160
She's still a country girl who doesn't know how to appreciate others.

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:06.520
Listen to your tone

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:09.960
The new girl has spent money, so don’t leave a message.

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:12.280
Just the first day after entering the house

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.760
It was a row all night long

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.040
Grandpa is angry

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:18.360
Throw him directly into the woodshed

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:21.040
Are you still tearing things apart now?

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:22.640
But this girl

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:23.960
What a stubborn person

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.920
He doesn't have enough food and salt.

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:29.120
Everything that was given to him to eat and drink was smashed out.

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:32.880
Wouldn't that implicate those of us who work?

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.520
Who says it's not?

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.320
I like this dish

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.560
Is the delivery almost done?

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:44.800
The shopkeeper is so small that he doesn't keep any distinguished guests.

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:45.800
Go to hell

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.040
Hey, who comes over, comes over, comes over?

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:53.120
What you spend all day long is either peanuts or beans.

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.520
Can you give me something meaty?

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:56.960
Go, go, go

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:01.000
Oh, I have to eat this too

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.360
Want to come back?

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:08.840
Come to our house for dinner

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.000
mom

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.280
Sister Yan

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.000
Neither of them are here

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.400
Are you looking for 13?

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:31.960
Yes, it’s the cold season right now

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:34.280
I took some medicine and asked him to keep it by his side.

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:38.480
Why haven't you seen a girlfriend with this face recently?

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:42.240
Didn’t you just join a few banks? Maybe you are busy?

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:45.400
2500 Sister

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.600
Something happened to my sister-in-law

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.360
Do you remember what I told you before?

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:53.280
This Liu Fugui probably doesn’t have a son.

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:54.880
I think it's a coincidence

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.400
Just in the name of delivering food

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.000
I went to Liu Fu and asked about it.

00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:59.200
really

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:03.240
Little story: I was tricked by my uncle into giving it to Liu Fugui

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:05.840
My little girl

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.720
My sister-in-law made a fuss when she found out what happened.

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.600
Offline has been locked up

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:11.040
Uncle

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.200
How could you deceive our whole family?

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:14.760
Tell grandma quickly

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.040
Let’s go to the Liu Mansion to ask for someone. Oh no, no, no.

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.760
Let's bite people rashly now

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.800
It will definitely not be given to us

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.080
Don't let us go over and make things worse.

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.200
No one wants it

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.840
Instead, he angered Liu Fugui's sister-in-law.

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:32.000
Liu Fugui, can he still kill his sister-in-law?

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:34.920
That's impossible to say

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.720
That Liu Fugui can make his uncle cheat into marriage?

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.000
He can also run rampant in Jing Bank.

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.720
Definitely not a camellia

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.280
This little girl is my lifeblood

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.920
Grandma will definitely go to Liu Fu to make trouble if she finds out.

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:50.760
So don't tell anyone else in the family

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:52.120
Wow

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:56.680
Mom, we can't just let it go.

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.440
I haven't figured it out yet

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:40.800
I want to go home

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.600
Want to be so stingy

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:47.240
I thought his strong temper was quite interesting.

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:48.960
oops

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:10.840
ah

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:13.960
I don’t have idle people in my house.

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:17.280
Either you take good care of me

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:20.760
Either you will risk your life, think about it yourself

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:26.800
Don't leave. I want to go home. I don't want to be a young lady.

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:29.960
ah

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:32.120
Home is almost gone

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:35.040
Where are you going? What do you mean?

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:37.480
When you come back, make it clear

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.280
Why is the holiday gone?

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:42.960
You come back and tell me clearly

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:45.120
Why is my home gone?

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:50.080
Ahhhhh

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:52.960
ah

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:57.120
What is this? Please write it quickly.

00:40:59.040 --> 00:40:59.840
listen

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.120
Send to the government

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.840
What is this

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.360
What is written here?

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:06.880
Write about foreign trade

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.360
It's the big chamber of commerce in town

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:10.200
Want to buy land in our village?

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.360
Buy a piece of land and have a look.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.520
Not only land

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:15.360
Let’s also talk about our courtyard house

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.040
How will we live from now on?

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:21.000
Hey, hey, people said it was bought with money.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.320
If we have money, we can live in the town.

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.040
Isn't this a good thing?

00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:28.080
You don't understand, don't make fun of me

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:32.360
We farmers, what do you rely on to make a living in the town?

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:33.920
Yes, oh, yes

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:37.080
It’s not enough to buy a new house just by buying a bungalow.

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:40.120
You have to give them enough money to live and do business.

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:42.200
Then I will sell my house and basement

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.800
I don't care enough about this money

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:46.520
No matter how much money you give me, I won’t go

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.760
Our ancestors have been here for generations

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:49.840
Follow me here too

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.120
well said

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:54.320
Ah, well said

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:56.240
You don't go this day

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.840
If you want to go, you can go

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:07.160
Oh, daddy, hey, you are finally back.

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:09.640
Sister Yue'er told me what's going on?

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:12.080
As soon as the land acquisition notice came out today,

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:13.880
The folks have no idea

00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:15.320
This is agreed

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:17.120
There are also people who won’t do it even to death.

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:19.120
I tore this notice right up.

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:20.840
Why don't I call you back quickly?

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:23.040
Let's discuss together what to discuss

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:25.080
Nothing to discuss

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:26.080
Not for sale

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:30.200
During the day, I heard that we would split a large sum of money.

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:39.200
Dad, please think about it

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.480
When we have money

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:43.720
You can also go to town and manage a house, right?

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:47.160
Dad, we didn’t even get together last time Big Brother took office, right?

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:49.160
Let's go to town together this time

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:50.680
Everyone is gathered

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:51.720
Don’t you often say

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:53.800
This whole family needs to be gathered together

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:54.800
shit

00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:58.200
If you go to town with your elder brother, you will be moving to your own home.

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:00.760
It’s because of your anchor brother

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:03.160
Now the land is sold

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:06.040
If someone kicks you out, your roots will be gone.

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:08.120
This is called becoming homeless and leaving one's homeland.

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:09.760
Can this be the same?

00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:14.720
The third child says a few words

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:18.000
Of course I listen to dad

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.240
Sell ​​it if dad says to sell it

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:20.360
Dad said not to sell

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:21.880
I won't sell it

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:24.240
Second child

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:26.560
Several generations of our family have relied on this

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:27.880
land revenue

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:30.360
Although this is not considered rich

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.080
But life can be considered peaceful

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:38.600
You can't destroy your roots

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:42.440
OK

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.720
Since what dad said

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:46.400
I also listen to my father.

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:49.440
I just went to inquire about it

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:51.200
This is not just our village

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:53.760
Several villages nearby are also fighting over each other.

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:56.880
I heard that Jingyangxing's methods are very good.

00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:59.000
Many are unwilling to sell

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.360
They were forced to sell all the land.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.080
It's Jing Yangxing who's throwing it away

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.080
on

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:16.720
god of

00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.720
wine that becomes spring rain
