00:09.560 --> 00:10.200
from

00:15.000 --> 00:15.680
go out

00:24.120 --> 00:24.960
Captain Yu

00:27.000 --> 00:27.840
Come on, stay safe

00:44.840 --> 00:45.640
why are you here

00:47.520 --> 00:48.120
Don't worry

00:49.240 --> 00:50.560
I'm not here to steal your business.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.320
Who are you?

00:56.280 --> 00:56.960
it's not important

00:58.040 --> 00:58.840
What matters is what's behind you

00:59.000 --> 01:00.040
There is a mechanism in the wooden box

01:02.480 --> 01:03.120
You robbed the Song family

01:03.320 --> 01:04.200
Not once or twice

01:05.400 --> 01:06.120
I don't want to this time either

01:06.280 --> 01:07.480
fell into their hands

01:11.320 --> 01:12.200
Could he be Team Leader Yu?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.200
These are the bandits

01:15.280 --> 01:16.120
Pretend they're a band

01:16.280 --> 01:17.120
come to this area

01:17.560 --> 01:18.640
Check various news

01:19.120 --> 01:20.280
How dare you steal something from the Song family?

01:21.120 --> 01:22.480
With such courage and strategy

01:22.920 --> 01:23.560
The captain should be

01:23.760 --> 01:25.120
Not an ordinary robber, right?

01:30.120 --> 01:30.760
Captain Yu

01:31.280 --> 01:32.640
This is the territory of the Song family

01:33.400 --> 01:34.320
If the noise is too loud

01:35.200 --> 01:36.120
This doesn't do any of us any good

01:46.920 --> 01:48.200
Leave the Song family alone and the Tang family alone

01:49.030 --> 01:49.680
today

01:50.560 --> 01:51.400
I originally planned

01:51.640 --> 01:52.400
Do something big

01:53.560 --> 01:54.200
I have no expectations

01:54.840 --> 01:56.400
I met Brother Shen here.

01:57.920 --> 01:59.400
Now that I have the opportunity to get in touch with the market here,

01:59.750 --> 02:00.320
not quality

02:00.920 --> 02:02.240
My jade is inlaid with gold, I want to kneel down

02:02.400 --> 02:04.120
Brother Shen invites you to chat

02:05.840 --> 02:07.360
After we get the money

02:08.840 --> 02:10.160
Two plus one is five

02:13.880 --> 02:14.560
brother

02:16.520 --> 02:17.440
how do you feel

03:28.400 --> 03:29.000
warn

03:41.000 --> 03:42.680
Turns out this is what you want

03:55.840 --> 03:56.400
Oh no

03:56.680 --> 03:57.560
There seems to be a thief in the backyard

03:57.800 --> 03:58.840
Someone has been sent to check

03:59.070 --> 04:00.400
What's this

04:00.680 --> 04:01.400
what happened?

04:02.840 --> 04:04.400
How was this meeting organized?

04:04.880 --> 04:06.120
Let thieves break in

04:07.440 --> 04:08.080
go catch him

04:08.160 --> 04:09.360
Guys, come with me

04:11.560 --> 04:12.280
What will you do when you're done?

04:12.720 --> 04:13.480
Xinnuo

04:26.400 --> 04:27.480
all friends

04:27.800 --> 04:30.000
stand with hands raised

04:30.600 --> 04:31.240
he jumps very high

04:31.800 --> 04:32.920
he sings

04:33.360 --> 04:35.400
The river flows eastward

04:35.600 --> 04:38.000
The stars in the sky join the Beidou

04:39.150 --> 04:40.240
Participate in Bidu

04:40.560 --> 04:42.800
A bowl of wine between life and death

04:43.150 --> 04:45.480
If you say let’s go, then let’s go

04:45.840 --> 04:46.800
go away

04:46.800 --> 04:47.360
Step down

05:01.720 --> 05:02.240
at home

05:02.240 --> 05:03.480
Don't let them escape quickly

05:03.480 --> 05:04.040
OK

05:25.160 --> 05:26.720
get out of the way, get out of the way

05:27.480 --> 05:29.480
OK

05:29.720 --> 05:31.480
Come again, come again

05:34.120 --> 05:35.000
Catching one is one

05:35.360 --> 05:35.840
arrest that woman

05:36.040 --> 05:36.600
Yes

05:53.920 --> 05:55.120
Since you want it so much

05:55.560 --> 05:56.560
this must be a good thing

05:57.040 --> 05:57.560
Thanks

06:01.720 --> 06:02.360
stop fighting

06:03.280 --> 06:04.000
withdrawal

06:05.240 --> 06:07.480
The river flows eastward

06:07.720 --> 06:10.160
The stars in the sky join the Beidou

06:11.160 --> 06:12.280
Participate in Bidu

06:12.680 --> 06:14.720
A bowl of wine between life and death

06:15.240 --> 06:17.400
If you say let’s go, then let’s go

06:18.720 --> 06:19.240
let's go

06:19.400 --> 06:21.000
People stood on stage with them.

06:21.480 --> 06:22.040
How many of you are there?

06:22.040 --> 06:23.000
the girl singing on stage

06:23.160 --> 06:23.800
Pull it down for me

06:24.160 --> 06:25.240
go! go! go

06:27.360 --> 06:29.560
Roar when you see injustice on the road

06:30.920 --> 06:32.360
OK

06:36.600 --> 06:37.480
This is Manier

06:39.560 --> 06:40.280
The overall situation is more important

06:40.720 --> 06:41.400
Waiting for other nursing homes to arrive

06:41.600 --> 06:42.720
we really can't leave

06:43.400 --> 06:43.840
She did it on purpose

06:44.040 --> 06:44.720
delay for us

06:45.360 --> 06:46.150
if we leave

06:46.680 --> 06:47.480
she will be in danger

06:49.280 --> 06:51.240
Everyone, stop her now.

06:52.150 --> 06:54.360
Come again, come again well

07:00.160 --> 07:01.240
waste

07:04.040 --> 07:04.800
What are you doing standing there?

07:05.000 --> 07:05.920
Run for your life quickly

07:06.120 --> 07:07.000
Burned to death, wait a minute.

07:08.480 --> 07:09.680
Come on, come on, come on, take a few people with you.

07:23.160 --> 07:23.800
Go first

07:36.920 --> 07:38.120
This wound is not superficial

07:38.400 --> 07:39.560
Let's go to the hospital tomorrow

07:41.480 --> 07:42.040
beautiful

07:45.040 --> 07:46.360
Thank you so much today, Mrs. Manner.

07:46.920 --> 07:47.920
If you don't cover us

07:48.120 --> 07:48.920
attract these people's attention

07:49.400 --> 07:50.000
we won't do that

07:50.000 --> 07:50.800
How could he escape so smoothly?

07:51.120 --> 07:51.720
You're welcome

07:52.800 --> 07:53.360
but

07:53.600 --> 07:54.240
She went to Song's house

07:54.400 --> 07:55.240
what are you looking for

07:55.920 --> 07:56.800
Until I had an argument with someone

07:57.400 --> 07:58.560
When I'm outside watching the wind

07:58.920 --> 07:59.720
I'm almost nervous

08:00.800 --> 08:01.800
You still know how to be afraid

08:04.840 --> 08:05.360
I let you go today

08:05.560 --> 08:06.280
why don't you go

08:07.840 --> 08:08.720
I am worried about you

08:12.680 --> 08:14.160
If today were not the Song Dynasty hall meeting,

08:14.920 --> 08:16.560
If the church gathering is not crowded

08:17.160 --> 08:18.160
If Thirteen and I hadn’t passed by

08:18.160 --> 08:19.360
i saved you

08:19.920 --> 08:20.800
You are still safe and sound

08:21.000 --> 08:21.720
Are you sitting here?

08:23.720 --> 08:25.280
I've told you many times it's dangerous

08:25.600 --> 08:26.080
Why you

08:26.080 --> 08:26.840
Just don't listen to me

08:27.000 --> 08:27.640
Are you determined to stay?

08:27.760 --> 08:28.600
Xinnuo

08:30.200 --> 08:32.120
I saved you, but you still blame me

08:32.720 --> 08:33.480
What's the purpose of this?

08:34.080 --> 08:35.120
Ryan Manner, let me tell you

08:36.360 --> 08:37.600
Full employment, losses and modest interest

08:38.360 --> 08:40.080
If you were here I could protect you

08:41.360 --> 08:42.480
If I am no longer here in the future

08:42.760 --> 08:43.360
I still

08:43.520 --> 08:44.600
If you weren't here where would you be?

08:56.440 --> 08:57.360
I'm just telling you

08:58.720 --> 09:00.320
when any decision is made in the future

09:01.720 --> 09:02.880
Please think before you act

09:05.360 --> 09:06.720
I think you're out of your mind

09:07.480 --> 09:08.240
Is it good or bad

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Confusing

09:11.520 --> 09:12.120
Miss Lian

09:12.440 --> 09:13.080
Miss Lian

09:31.840 --> 09:32.760
Why are you standing there staring at me?

09:34.240 --> 09:34.840
there is nothing

09:35.320 --> 09:36.480
I just feel weird

09:36.720 --> 09:37.720
Langjun, tell me

09:38.320 --> 09:38.840
How can you prepare?

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
I lived there for a long time

09:40.240 --> 09:41.880
Like this simple house?

09:44.080 --> 09:45.640
Is this still the Shin Nu I know?

09:51.640 --> 09:52.240
Mr. Lang

09:52.760 --> 09:55.960
Do you like Miss Lian?

09:56.120 --> 09:56.720
What are you talking nonsense about?

09:57.000 --> 09:57.480
then only you

09:57.640 --> 09:59.120
Why are you so angry?

10:02.600 --> 10:03.520
Even if I tell you you won't understand

10:06.320 --> 10:07.120
I really do not understand

10:22.960 --> 10:24.080
Today, gold and jade are in the Song Mansion

10:24.240 --> 10:25.120
caused such a big disturbance

10:25.840 --> 10:26.640
should be a band

10:27.120 --> 10:28.120
I won't stay in the city

10:29.600 --> 10:30.760
so they took their books

10:31.600 --> 10:32.880
We have to find a way to get it back

10:33.760 --> 10:35.200
I'm going to a big car shop tomorrow

10:35.640 --> 10:36.840
Let's see if we can discover anything.

10:37.240 --> 10:38.640
OK, I'll go with you

10:39.080 --> 10:39.600
No

10:40.760 --> 10:41.720
it has good comfort

11:22.520 --> 11:23.320
Mr. Liu

11:32.760 --> 11:34.600
it's great

11:38.720 --> 11:39.480
little teacher

11:46.240 --> 11:47.000
Master Wu, please save my life.

11:47.880 --> 11:48.360
today

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
This is the old lady at home

11:50.240 --> 11:50.840
Buddha Day

11:51.600 --> 11:52.480
my parents follow

11:52.760 --> 11:53.720
arranged a meeting

11:54.520 --> 11:55.480
But who would have thought

11:55.880 --> 11:56.600
these are opera singers

11:56.760 --> 11:57.960
This is a bunch of bad people

11:58.520 --> 11:59.000
Both

11:59.600 --> 12:00.520
They can't steal money

12:01.520 --> 12:02.440
So he stole the book

12:03.360 --> 12:04.200
This is all a long follow-up

12:04.600 --> 12:05.480
This was an accidental arrangement

12:05.760 --> 12:06.600
It's him who is incompetent

12:07.320 --> 12:08.360
I tie it up

12:09.120 --> 12:10.000
i apologize to you

12:27.720 --> 12:28.880
I'm watching

12:30.200 --> 12:32.000
Refer to Miss Xiao’s hesitation

12:33.200 --> 12:34.360
After Liu Chan was arrested

12:34.760 --> 12:35.520
under house arrest

12:35.720 --> 12:37.720
Luoyang, the capital of Weizhou

12:38.840 --> 12:41.000
Sima Zhao, General of Wei State

12:42.120 --> 12:43.120
Call Liu Chan

12:43.520 --> 12:45.000
Watch Shaw dance

12:45.760 --> 12:48.480
When Xu officials saw this, they burst into tears.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.640
Only Liu Chan can forget his worries

12:52.640 --> 12:54.120
laugh freely

12:57.840 --> 12:58.640
Song Gongzi

13:00.960 --> 13:03.080
What do you think?

13:05.480 --> 13:06.120
Lord Wu

13:06.600 --> 13:08.240
Really knowledgeable and rich

13:10.040 --> 13:11.120
Thank you for your suggestion

13:11.840 --> 13:12.840
tell you the truth

13:13.480 --> 13:15.080
Because the book is lost

13:15.480 --> 13:16.720
I am afraid

13:17.000 --> 13:18.120
No consideration for food and tea

13:18.480 --> 13:19.480
This guy lost a lot of weight

13:20.080 --> 13:20.600
but

13:20.840 --> 13:22.480
The story I just told is about Liu Chan

13:22.960 --> 13:25.000
I suddenly realized

13:25.600 --> 13:26.720
Very correct

13:27.440 --> 13:28.760
It doesn't matter where we are

13:29.000 --> 13:30.120
in any case

13:30.600 --> 13:33.440
stay optimistic and open

13:41.120 --> 13:42.080
you are in vain

13:43.120 --> 13:45.000
Named after the character Kon

13:49.640 --> 13:51.840
Please also ask Mr. Wu to clarify this matter

13:56.640 --> 13:58.960
The only one who has no choice is Adou.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.240
Wu Ye Wu Ye

14:01.480 --> 14:02.600
Know

14:03.320 --> 14:04.000
The book is missing

14:04.480 --> 14:05.480
Big things will affect you

14:06.520 --> 14:07.720
I really deserve to die

14:08.760 --> 14:10.000
I

14:12.000 --> 14:13.240
no problem

14:14.120 --> 14:15.720
You have been following me for many years

14:17.000 --> 14:18.760
I understand your sincerity

14:24.000 --> 14:24.880
let's go back

14:32.480 --> 14:33.440
she says

14:41.440 --> 14:42.480
little teacher

14:47.720 --> 14:49.080
Mr. Song stays

14:59.760 --> 15:00.480
this

15:10.520 --> 15:11.440
I still don't understand

15:22.520 --> 15:24.000
let's do it

15:35.440 --> 15:37.720
The eldest young master doesn't want this.

15:37.840 --> 15:38.640
look at me when i follow you

15:38.720 --> 15:39.760
more than twenty years

15:40.960 --> 15:41.960
little teacher

15:47.240 --> 15:47.760
big deal

15:49.360 --> 15:50.240
big deal

15:53.120 --> 15:54.120
little teacher

17:12.560 --> 17:13.040
Mother

17:13.560 --> 17:14.280
you early in the morning

17:14.760 --> 17:16.960
Make such a luxurious meal

17:17.680 --> 17:18.720
my mother didn't do this

17:20.640 --> 17:21.040
dad

17:24.280 --> 17:25.240
don't eat anything

17:26.720 --> 17:27.480
you did it

17:28.640 --> 17:29.720
You even swept the yard

17:30.880 --> 17:32.240
You can also feed pigs and cows

17:33.280 --> 17:34.160
me and no equipment

17:34.200 --> 17:34.720
this is not what you did

17:34.720 --> 17:35.720
Are you kind enough to receive him?

17:36.000 --> 17:37.080
I thought I had to do something

17:37.280 --> 17:38.080
He repays your kindness

17:38.680 --> 17:40.240
You're so polite, aren't you?

17:40.560 --> 17:41.440
I said they are all sons of our country

17:41.760 --> 17:42.880
A diligent and lovely person

17:43.280 --> 17:43.880
Last

17:44.920 --> 17:45.680
Forget it, you're done

17:46.240 --> 17:47.000
Miss Manier

17:47.280 --> 17:48.080
In fact, the original intention of No Gear

17:48.240 --> 17:49.920
This is not the case with him

17:50.200 --> 17:50.880
I put it aside

17:52.720 --> 17:54.000
Auntie, it’s so cold this morning

17:54.040 --> 17:54.480
Something like this will happen again in the future

17:54.680 --> 17:55.480
Just leave it to me

17:56.200 --> 17:57.080
No need for me to wash it myself

17:57.240 --> 17:57.720
beautiful

17:57.920 --> 17:58.720
I'm good at doing laundry

17:58.880 --> 17:59.440
You believe me

17:59.440 --> 18:00.000
No I'm fine

18:00.000 --> 18:00.480
I can do it

18:00.480 --> 18:01.160
No

18:01.240 --> 18:02.000
you give me

18:08.200 --> 18:08.960
Mom, let's eat

18:09.000 --> 18:09.720
this

18:11.400 --> 18:12.200
this child

18:49.000 --> 18:49.480
girl

18:49.880 --> 18:51.080
Your skin and hair belong to your parents

18:51.280 --> 18:52.400
How could one surrender willingly?

18:52.720 --> 18:53.400
I'm not

18:53.720 --> 18:54.640
what you are not

18:55.800 --> 18:57.480
Girls need to calm down

18:57.800 --> 18:58.280
in this world

18:58.480 --> 18:59.480
There is no obstacle that cannot be overcome

18:59.680 --> 19:00.680
Even if there are truly insurmountable obstacles

19:00.920 --> 19:01.560
We are near Aqaba

19:01.720 --> 19:02.200
stay a little

19:02.400 --> 19:03.520
This may not be an option.

19:03.720 --> 19:04.560
I don't

19:04.760 --> 19:05.400
there is nothing

19:05.560 --> 19:06.880
Why are you so naughty?

19:07.240 --> 19:08.440
Jumping into the river on such a cold day

19:08.680 --> 19:09.720
What if you don't die?

19:09.960 --> 19:11.160
you will lose half your life

19:11.480 --> 19:12.240
Even if I die

19:12.480 --> 19:12.880
you are in the river

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
I would also act like a half-human being.

19:14.160 --> 19:14.680
very scary

19:14.800 --> 19:15.480
do you know

19:15.920 --> 19:17.040
I won't die

19:17.480 --> 19:19.000
My clothes fell into the river

19:19.240 --> 19:20.480
Don't make such unreasonable excuses

19:21.040 --> 19:22.240
Where are you?

19:32.040 --> 19:32.680
sorry girl

19:33.080 --> 19:33.720
this is my misunderstanding

19:34.160 --> 19:35.000
wait a second

19:58.920 --> 19:59.480
girl

20:01.920 --> 20:02.560
your clothes

20:05.160 --> 20:06.000
thank you, sir

20:15.080 --> 20:15.680
little teacher

20:16.480 --> 20:17.640
Where do you live?

20:18.080 --> 20:18.640
How could I never do this?

20:18.760 --> 20:19.640
i have never seen you

20:20.480 --> 20:21.520
Do you know Xinnu?

20:24.400 --> 20:25.080
i am a country boy

20:25.400 --> 20:27.000
I am temporarily living in Shisanli Yingzi.

20:31.440 --> 20:31.880
Which

20:32.440 --> 20:33.680
May I have your name

20:34.200 --> 20:34.760
My name is Changfeng

20:35.160 --> 20:36.080
Others call me Thirteen

20:36.560 --> 20:37.680
please call me thirteen

20:38.920 --> 20:39.960
Changfeng

21:28.760 --> 21:29.400
Little brother

21:29.960 --> 21:30.440
Just wanted to ask

21:31.040 --> 21:32.280
Wasn't there a theater troupe before?

21:32.640 --> 21:33.560
Are you preparing the stage for singing here?

21:34.000 --> 21:34.720
where are they?

21:36.000 --> 21:36.680
forgotten

21:37.040 --> 21:37.640
those people

21:37.760 --> 21:38.960
Not a good person

21:39.240 --> 21:40.560
He robbed the Song family and then escaped.

21:42.240 --> 21:43.000
Yes

21:45.720 --> 21:46.640
That's unfortunate

21:47.000 --> 21:47.760
I prefer to listen

21:47.920 --> 21:48.640
they sing opera

21:49.320 --> 21:49.720
then you know

21:49.920 --> 21:50.640
Where did they go?

21:51.240 --> 21:52.480
How do I know this?

21:52.760 --> 21:53.320
I would like to know

21:53.640 --> 21:55.160
I went to the government early to collect my award.

21:55.400 --> 21:56.040
look

21:56.640 --> 21:57.920
The government people are coming

21:58.040 --> 21:59.040
it comes one after another

21:59.280 --> 22:00.480
Turn this upside down

22:01.280 --> 22:02.200
this is a disaster for us

22:02.480 --> 22:02.960
Who will dare to come in the future?

22:03.080 --> 22:04.000
Stop at a large car store

22:04.720 --> 22:05.640
impossible

22:06.160 --> 22:08.000
Come here and let me help you

22:08.240 --> 22:08.720
Where do you put this?

22:09.040 --> 22:09.800
just put it there

22:13.080 --> 22:13.880
This wine jar

23:27.240 --> 23:28.240
second wife

23:28.480 --> 23:30.240
There are nails in your ass

23:30.240 --> 23:31.560
Did you get the bed?

23:31.760 --> 23:32.800
Everything has come to this point

23:32.960 --> 23:34.520
Why don't you come and cook?

23:36.320 --> 23:36.880
Yes

23:37.560 --> 23:38.040
Yes

23:38.800 --> 23:39.560
This woman smells so bad

23:40.440 --> 23:41.800
Why haven't you come back yet?

23:43.240 --> 23:43.960
Mother

23:44.480 --> 23:46.000
Doing laundry takes a long time

23:46.720 --> 23:47.760
Your grandmother, your great-grandmother, asks you to cook.

23:47.960 --> 23:48.520
Go quickly

23:49.080 --> 23:49.720
Mother

23:50.480 --> 23:51.640
I want to go home and rest for a while

23:51.880 --> 23:53.000
Ashar suffered a lot

23:53.640 --> 23:54.320
so cold

23:55.920 --> 23:57.000
Where is this water?

23:57.880 --> 23:58.520
No one brings water

23:59.320 --> 24:00.000
You pour water

24:00.240 --> 24:01.640
Hurry up and get your dad some water.

24:03.040 --> 24:03.720
How is this going

24:04.640 --> 24:06.000
I went out to do laundry and it was very cold.

24:06.400 --> 24:07.040
come over

24:11.320 --> 24:11.880
The wind is very cold

24:12.760 --> 24:13.720
I can not

24:14.040 --> 24:15.400
How can you be so sensitive?

24:15.760 --> 24:16.200
you want to be cool

24:16.320 --> 24:17.160
She went home and added some clothes

24:17.440 --> 24:18.280
Then go and cook quickly

24:18.880 --> 24:19.640
Help yourself

24:26.240 --> 24:27.480
It feels a little burning to the touch

24:28.480 --> 24:29.680
How about we find a doctor?

24:31.160 --> 24:31.760
stop

24:32.920 --> 24:34.200
Just what little money we have

24:34.760 --> 24:36.480
It's not enough for my stepdad to fix it next month.

24:37.160 --> 24:37.800
Say it again

24:38.560 --> 24:39.720
There is a lot of life at home

24:40.160 --> 24:40.680
Just in case you can find a doctor

24:40.800 --> 24:41.640
does it look good or bad

24:42.160 --> 24:43.000
Who will do the work?

24:44.160 --> 24:44.800
return

24:45.640 --> 24:46.560
Just take it with you and it will pass

24:46.880 --> 24:47.680
Yes

25:26.800 --> 25:27.320
Lang Jun

25:27.960 --> 25:28.720
I will be back soon

25:29.080 --> 25:30.000
Did you discover anything?

25:33.760 --> 25:34.240
Come

25:37.440 --> 25:37.960
this band

25:38.240 --> 25:39.200
when you panic and run away

25:39.480 --> 25:40.320
Leave a lot of fashion

25:41.240 --> 25:42.640
All fashion has this flavor

25:43.280 --> 25:43.800
and

25:44.200 --> 25:44.920
Last time I talked about gold inlaid with jade

25:45.040 --> 25:45.720
during battle

25:46.240 --> 25:46.720
accidentally touched

25:46.880 --> 25:47.720
powder in her bag

25:48.160 --> 25:49.040
They all taste the same

25:50.000 --> 25:50.640
smells like

25:51.000 --> 25:52.320
Made from specific medicinal plants

25:53.240 --> 25:54.200
Check in this direction

25:54.800 --> 25:55.920
maybe i can get some ideas

26:14.920 --> 26:17.200
Sister Yi'er

26:18.080 --> 26:18.760
Manier

26:20.960 --> 26:21.920
Why don't you sit down?

26:22.080 --> 26:22.800
take a break

26:23.520 --> 26:24.280
I completed

26:31.640 --> 26:33.000
Put it down, Manier

26:38.480 --> 26:39.520
Why are you so hot?

26:40.480 --> 26:40.960
go to hospital

26:42.000 --> 26:42.480
I don't plan to

26:42.720 --> 26:43.880
I haven't finished all the work yet

26:44.160 --> 26:45.160
Well you have to have a life to do that.

26:46.520 --> 26:47.480
It just so happened that I had something to do at the hospital.

26:48.000 --> 26:48.720
with me

26:49.000 --> 26:49.920
Manier

26:50.640 --> 26:51.760
Thirteen is gone

26:52.080 --> 26:52.960
go to the doctor

26:54.880 --> 26:55.680
Thank you, Mrs. Marner

26:56.000 --> 26:57.240
It's not a big problem for me anymore

26:57.240 --> 26:58.000
this

26:59.160 --> 27:00.240
Lian Man'er will take you to see him

27:00.720 --> 27:02.160
He is a doctor named Wang Yuying

27:02.640 --> 27:03.880
Wang Youheng often goes to the mountains to collect medicine.

27:04.240 --> 27:05.280
Maybe these are medicinal plants

27:05.520 --> 27:06.160
completely familiar

27:06.800 --> 27:07.560
Give it to him to get to know her

27:08.240 --> 27:09.520
Miss Manner, please wait for me

27:10.560 --> 27:11.280
not together?

27:13.760 --> 27:14.400
I dont go

27:15.320 --> 27:16.720
Manier must be angry with me

27:17.000 --> 27:17.720
Go quickly

27:18.880 --> 27:19.400
Yes

27:20.720 --> 27:21.480
Then I'll go there first

27:32.920 --> 27:33.520
This is cold wind

27:34.320 --> 27:35.000
I'm going to get medicine

27:35.800 --> 27:36.440
Brother Yang

27:37.320 --> 27:38.480
I don't need to take medicine

27:42.480 --> 27:44.680
Although the wind and cold are always present,

27:45.080 --> 27:45.920
But if you don't pay attention

27:46.240 --> 27:47.240
The consequences can be big or small

27:48.000 --> 27:48.480
and

27:48.720 --> 27:50.000
You have a high fever again

27:50.280 --> 27:50.920
It is very likely that this will result in

27:51.040 --> 27:51.760
from other diseases

27:52.080 --> 27:52.760
Not to be underestimated

27:53.240 --> 27:54.000
beautiful

27:55.680 --> 27:56.920
Brother Heng, go get the medicine.

27:58.800 --> 27:59.240
correct

27:59.520 --> 28:01.000
There's someone there who's my friend

28:01.240 --> 28:01.720
His name is No. 13

28:02.240 --> 28:03.000
There is some damage to the body

28:03.400 --> 28:04.200
Please help me

28:04.760 --> 28:05.560
OK

28:09.920 --> 28:10.480
What’s wrong with you

28:10.920 --> 28:11.480
Injuried

28:11.960 --> 28:12.800
Which one is injured?

28:13.000 --> 28:13.280
here

28:14.480 --> 28:15.720
Then take off your clothes first

28:15.800 --> 28:16.480
I'll bring you medicine

28:18.400 --> 28:19.040
Sister Ye

28:19.720 --> 28:20.640
What are you looking at

28:23.880 --> 28:24.480
Please introduce yourself

28:25.160 --> 28:25.680
home business

28:25.920 --> 28:26.960
You are the one who does the most

28:27.400 --> 28:28.040
it keeps getting called

28:28.240 --> 28:29.320
just like a server

28:30.320 --> 28:31.520
you can't keep it anymore

28:32.320 --> 28:33.000
you must resist

28:34.560 --> 28:35.240
Manier

28:35.800 --> 28:37.640
I know you do this for my own good

28:38.440 --> 28:39.720
But look at me like this

28:40.160 --> 28:41.160
What capabilities do I have?

28:41.320 --> 28:42.240
bear

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
everyone has a destiny

28:45.720 --> 28:46.920
This is my life

28:47.160 --> 28:48.520
What is inanimate?

28:49.760 --> 28:50.960
if you are ready

28:52.720 --> 28:53.960
I can make money with you

28:54.760 --> 28:55.880
After economic independence

28:56.680 --> 28:58.000
There will be capital resistance

28:58.400 --> 28:59.640
No one dares to bully you anymore

29:01.160 --> 29:02.480
Independent Golden Rooster Award

29:04.800 --> 29:05.480
under any circumstances

29:05.760 --> 29:07.240
i will be with you forever

29:10.720 --> 29:12.200
Thank you Munir

29:20.080 --> 29:20.760
Brother Yang

29:21.560 --> 29:23.560
I don’t know if I can see it

29:23.760 --> 29:25.200
What is this incense made of?

29:32.720 --> 29:34.200
This is not spice

29:34.880 --> 29:37.400
Mainly fennel and wormwood

29:37.760 --> 29:39.000
calamus lemongrass

29:39.760 --> 29:41.200
How to make these common condiments

29:41.880 --> 29:42.480
Then say it

29:42.680 --> 29:43.520
Can't everyone do it?

29:43.720 --> 29:44.520
these spices

29:44.720 --> 29:45.440
it's not personal

29:46.160 --> 29:46.800
This is not necessarily the case

29:47.560 --> 29:48.880
There are some herbs in it

29:49.040 --> 29:49.720
Call cloud

29:50.240 --> 29:50.800
this herb

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
Still relatively rare

29:52.520 --> 29:53.960
This herb is mainly used for

29:54.080 --> 29:55.560
Get rid of an insect called a pincer beetle

29:56.560 --> 29:57.720
This insect is only found in a handful of...

29:57.920 --> 30:00.080
The area is infested and likes to suck blood.

30:00.680 --> 30:01.280
Once a person is bitten

30:01.560 --> 30:02.480
You will develop a rash all over your body

30:02.720 --> 30:03.520
severe itching

30:04.080 --> 30:04.640
serious time

30:04.880 --> 30:05.920
It may even be life-threatening

30:06.440 --> 30:06.960
so

30:07.280 --> 30:08.320
Only if you suffer from such insects

30:08.520 --> 30:09.200
people in trouble

30:09.520 --> 30:10.960
Only then can we use the cloud to repel insects

30:13.080 --> 30:13.920
cloud

30:14.680 --> 30:15.240
Brother Yang

30:15.720 --> 30:17.480
Do you know this insect?

30:17.760 --> 30:18.560
Where do they appear most often?

30:19.160 --> 30:20.280
if you want to find it

30:20.680 --> 30:21.720
Just walk south along Hualing

30:21.920 --> 30:22.480
five or sixty miles

30:23.000 --> 30:24.440
There is a cloud over there

30:24.760 --> 30:25.720
Ask the person who has received the most medicine

30:26.000 --> 30:27.040
maybe i can ask

30:28.800 --> 30:29.640
i did well

30:30.480 --> 30:31.320
Sorry for causing you trouble

30:31.480 --> 30:32.240
Polite

30:32.680 --> 30:33.000
counting

30:36.040 --> 30:37.560
Drink the Spirit of Wind twice a day

30:37.680 --> 30:38.440
Just drink it for three days

30:39.400 --> 30:40.320
I brought you a few more pairs

30:41.160 --> 30:42.000
This way you will

30:42.200 --> 30:42.960
when the rain comes

30:43.240 --> 30:44.160
You can also drink it as soon as possible

30:44.400 --> 30:45.200
It also has a protective effect

30:46.240 --> 30:46.760
Manier

30:47.240 --> 30:49.240
It is said that this came from the Western Regions

30:49.520 --> 30:50.480
What is wine?

30:50.880 --> 30:51.720
Take it back and try it

30:54.000 --> 30:55.400
High quality

30:56.000 --> 30:57.680
There's wine for sale here

30:58.240 --> 30:58.960
We don't have it here

30:59.400 --> 30:59.960
this is my father

31:00.160 --> 31:01.000
When going out to collect debts

31:01.240 --> 31:02.320
Reposted from elsewhere

31:07.000 --> 31:07.640
So here we are

31:08.000 --> 31:09.040
There will be one soon

31:10.480 --> 31:11.960
Fifty or sixty miles south of Hualing

31:12.320 --> 31:12.960
correct

31:15.480 --> 31:16.040
very good

31:17.000 --> 31:18.280
This will lock the position

31:19.560 --> 31:20.640
Then we'll set off tomorrow

31:21.000 --> 31:22.480
Find Jin Xiangyu and retrieve the book

31:22.720 --> 31:23.880
we can go back

31:26.000 --> 31:26.520
tomorrow

31:28.000 --> 31:28.720
What's wrong

31:34.000 --> 31:34.640
Lang Jun

31:36.080 --> 31:36.760
you

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
I can't give up Miss Manner

31:44.560 --> 31:45.440
Let’s go back this time

31:46.040 --> 31:47.240
I'm afraid I won't come back

31:48.080 --> 31:49.400
Do you want to spend the day with her first?

31:52.880 --> 31:53.920
give me a day

31:55.000 --> 31:55.920
Go the day after tomorrow

33:00.680 --> 33:01.320
how

33:03.000 --> 33:03.880
You can't afford it either

33:26.560 --> 33:27.080
Ryan Manner

33:36.480 --> 33:37.480
where are you going?

33:37.960 --> 33:38.480
Where am I going?

33:38.640 --> 33:39.480
What does she have to do with you?

33:41.720 --> 33:43.960
I was very worried yesterday

33:45.000 --> 33:45.880
Worried that you are in danger

33:46.640 --> 33:48.080
So I'm a little smug

33:48.480 --> 33:49.720
Can you call it smaller?

33:50.000 --> 33:51.240
Almost ate me

33:52.480 --> 33:53.280
We have Mr. Xin

33:53.760 --> 33:55.040
Yesterday I was talking sensibly

33:55.400 --> 33:57.000
Be cheerful today

33:58.320 --> 34:01.040
So moody

34:01.560 --> 34:02.200
sorry

34:02.680 --> 34:03.400
Manier

34:10.040 --> 34:11.520
Sorry, let's go.

34:15.760 --> 34:16.920
i have something to tell you

34:31.960 --> 34:33.000
I just want to ask you

34:34.360 --> 34:35.440
where are you going?

34:36.600 --> 34:37.800
Go up the mountain to find grapes

34:38.190 --> 34:39.000
I'm looking for grapes

34:40.120 --> 34:41.560
What other crazy idea did you come up with?

34:42.600 --> 34:43.920
Brother Youheng yesterday

34:44.080 --> 34:45.150
He gave me a box of wine

34:45.800 --> 34:46.400
I would like to know

34:46.480 --> 34:47.480
This thing is all around us

34:47.480 --> 34:48.480
But there are some rare things

34:49.080 --> 34:50.190
I plan to go up the mountain

34:50.480 --> 34:51.600
find some blueberries

34:52.440 --> 34:53.150
Looking for a home?

34:53.150 --> 34:54.630
wash and dry

35:02.680 --> 35:04.000
What are your thoughts on the idea of ​​winemaking?

35:04.000 --> 35:04.760
What's up with her

35:04.760 --> 35:05.480
not too good

35:08.880 --> 35:10.040
If you like wine

35:10.440 --> 35:12.000
Not to mention the complicated process

35:12.280 --> 35:13.200
Just the sales side

35:13.600 --> 35:14.480
difficult to develop

35:15.440 --> 35:16.000
what do you think?

35:16.600 --> 35:17.600
This poor man can't afford it

35:18.160 --> 35:19.200
You can't reach the rich

35:20.920 --> 35:22.480
What about distilled wine?

35:23.640 --> 35:24.520
distilled wine

35:26.120 --> 35:27.600
Just use the distillation method

35:27.600 --> 35:29.280
Reduce fermentation difficulty

35:29.400 --> 35:30.760
retain fruity aroma

35:31.040 --> 35:32.160
It can also reduce the price of wine

35:32.280 --> 35:33.080
cheaper

35:33.840 --> 35:34.560
looks like this

35:34.560 --> 35:35.400
You can have a try

35:36.760 --> 35:37.920
This is the height of emperors and generals

35:38.000 --> 35:38.800
Literary and elegant guests

35:39.360 --> 35:40.440
Reach out to the public at large

35:40.800 --> 35:41.760
they all drink

35:42.200 --> 35:43.440
that's cheap

35:44.040 --> 35:44.920
again very rare

35:45.320 --> 35:46.440
Don’t worry about running out of sales

35:50.000 --> 35:51.280
But why are you right?

35:51.440 --> 35:52.280
About VIP

35:52.440 --> 35:53.880
you know clearly

35:55.800 --> 35:56.880
i just heard

35:57.360 --> 35:59.600
Listen, listen, listen again

36:00.080 --> 36:00.760
What other secrets do you have?

36:01.000 --> 36:01.840
This is something I don't know

36:47.760 --> 36:49.400
I didn’t expect that in this deep mountain and ancient forest

36:49.960 --> 36:52.120
There is also a hot spring cave.

36:53.360 --> 36:55.360
hole hole hole hole

36:55.480 --> 36:56.480
Look, there's an echo

36:57.840 --> 36:59.000
This Jinyang County belongs to the southeast

36:59.200 --> 36:59.920
surrounded by mountains

37:00.800 --> 37:01.640
I've heard about it for a long time

37:01.880 --> 37:02.480
There are quite a few here

37:02.600 --> 37:03.320
hidden hot spring

37:03.920 --> 37:05.480
It was indeed like this when I saw it today

37:11.640 --> 37:13.480
This winter is very warm

37:13.840 --> 37:14.800
There is sunshine during the day

37:15.280 --> 37:16.200
Next to the hot spring

37:17.080 --> 37:18.520
Constant humidity throughout the seasons

37:19.840 --> 37:21.600
It's the right time, the right place and the right person

37:22.200 --> 37:23.440
What is the right time, place and people

37:24.440 --> 37:25.120
Where is the weather good?

37:25.600 --> 37:27.880
Today I will go to the mountains with you

37:28.560 --> 37:29.360
What a convenient location

37:29.880 --> 37:31.480
This is a hot spring cave

37:32.480 --> 37:33.560
Where is the harmony between people?

37:34.000 --> 37:35.480
This is a hot spring cave

37:35.760 --> 37:36.480
Smart Ryan Mannier

37:36.600 --> 37:37.320
found it

37:41.360 --> 37:42.160
echo loudly

37:42.920 --> 37:43.440
Have you given it another thought?

37:43.600 --> 37:44.520
What was your idea?

37:46.440 --> 37:46.880
trustworthy

37:47.360 --> 37:48.600
I will give you a surprise later

37:58.000 --> 37:58.480
everyone is here

37:58.600 --> 37:59.560
have fun and enjoy it

38:00.280 --> 38:00.680
The difference is

38:01.120 --> 38:01.880
i just feel ashamed

38:01.920 --> 38:02.840
gift from god

38:02.840 --> 38:03.680
hurry up

38:26.840 --> 38:27.680
Are you really with another girl?

38:27.880 --> 38:28.600
Not the same thing

38:42.400 --> 38:43.000
Ryan Manner

38:46.360 --> 38:47.200
If one day

38:48.400 --> 38:49.080
I gotta go

38:50.160 --> 38:51.080
Will you keep me?

38:52.760 --> 38:54.120
If I keep you, you won't leave

39:01.000 --> 39:02.080
say goodbye to this

39:02.760 --> 39:03.840
I am the most absent

39:06.840 --> 39:08.680
if you want to leave

39:09.520 --> 39:10.400
Then I must

39:10.760 --> 39:12.080
I can't say hello to people around me

39:13.640 --> 39:15.040
It doesn't make any sense to say this.

39:16.200 --> 39:18.200
Only fear remains

39:19.080 --> 39:19.640
This is worse than...

39:19.920 --> 39:21.360
I say goodbye quietly in my heart

39:24.000 --> 39:24.840
do you really think so

39:29.960 --> 39:31.000
How many times have you said that in the past few days?

39:31.160 --> 39:31.760
I'm leaving I'm leaving

39:32.280 --> 39:33.000
do you really want to leave

39:33.600 --> 39:34.400
where are you going?

39:35.000 --> 39:35.880
when

39:40.920 --> 39:42.120
you asked for this

39:42.800 --> 39:43.800
Are you chasing me away?

39:46.480 --> 39:47.440
I'm just thinking

39:47.880 --> 39:49.280
You can't stay at Lian's house forever

39:49.560 --> 39:50.360
Also for the future

39:50.360 --> 39:51.080
plan to plan

39:52.160 --> 39:53.280
Our family

39:53.760 --> 39:55.160
But no one will fire you

39:55.760 --> 39:56.360
you

39:56.680 --> 39:58.840
A perfect match for our Lianjia woodshed.

40:00.280 --> 40:00.840
besides it

40:01.280 --> 40:02.480
Garlic and peanut trade ends

40:03.040 --> 40:03.960
we have to hurry

40:04.200 --> 40:05.000
Find a new job

40:05.760 --> 40:06.680
can't waste time

40:07.160 --> 40:08.040
And you?

40:09.880 --> 40:11.440
Although the work is not easy

40:12.280 --> 40:13.400
My brain is not as smart as mine

40:14.200 --> 40:15.640
But getting help is better than none

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
stay calm

40:23.280 --> 40:23.920
OK

40:26.200 --> 40:26.880
what you just said

40:27.200 --> 40:28.280
distilled spirits trade

40:29.000 --> 40:29.960
I think it's really good

40:31.120 --> 40:33.160
I will ask my father later

40:33.480 --> 40:34.600
See if he can come up with something

40:34.640 --> 40:36.600
Is it distillation or something?

40:37.080 --> 40:37.560
my father is very convenient

40:37.760 --> 40:38.400
absolutely no problem

40:39.040 --> 40:40.640
Where will the two of us be tomorrow morning?

40:40.800 --> 40:42.880
Continue up the mountain to pick grapes

40:43.760 --> 40:44.400
OK

40:44.920 --> 40:46.560
Wine trade rebounds after

40:47.000 --> 40:48.320
we can save a lot of money

40:48.480 --> 40:50.000
Then you can start working in the industry

40:51.160 --> 40:51.800
this cave

40:52.000 --> 40:53.160
I have to make good use of it too

40:54.000 --> 40:54.920
you must help me

40:56.680 --> 40:57.320
OK

40:59.080 --> 41:01.120
I haven't even told you what I need you to do.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.080
you just know it's good

41:04.640 --> 41:07.400
How would you like me to help you in the future?

41:08.280 --> 41:08.960
I promise you everything

41:10.320 --> 41:10.960
Which

41:11.840 --> 41:13.320
All the money you make belongs to me

41:18.440 --> 41:19.120
Real or fake?

41:20.000 --> 41:20.760
That's it

41:24.320 --> 41:26.280
The comments on the hook will not change in a hundred years

41:26.440 --> 41:27.880
If you change, you'll be a big fool

41:35.360 --> 41:37.440
Dongshi City has a good location

41:38.080 --> 41:39.320
Let's go take a look when we have time.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
maybe in the future

41:41.160 --> 41:42.320
business can be done there

41:42.920 --> 41:43.680
he makes money

41:43.880 --> 41:45.000
Buy another piece of land for your parents

42:12.600 --> 42:13.280
Xinnuo

42:22.760 --> 42:23.440
Xinnuo

42:25.080 --> 42:25.920
Xinnuo

42:27.520 --> 42:28.560
I'm going to look for grapes

42:38.320 --> 42:39.120
nobody

43:04.120 --> 43:05.960
if you want to leave

43:06.640 --> 43:07.600
Then I must

43:07.840 --> 43:09.160
I can't say hello to people around me

43:10.480 --> 43:11.920
It doesn't make any sense to say this.

43:13.280 --> 43:15.280
Only fear remains

43:16.320 --> 43:16.880
This is worse than...

43:16.920 --> 43:18.400
I say goodbye quietly in my heart

43:46.200 --> 43:47.280
Slow down, slow down, what are you doing?

43:47.480 --> 43:48.000
hurry

43:48.320 --> 43:48.880
Have you seen Xinnuo?

43:48.880 --> 43:50.080
La, Xinnuo?

43:54.440 --> 43:55.040
Have you seen Xinnuo?

43:55.480 --> 43:56.320
I did not see it

44:00.760 --> 44:01.160
uncle

44:01.480 --> 44:02.360
Have you seen Xinnuo?

44:02.480 --> 44:03.080
No uh

44:04.320 --> 44:05.040
Thanks
