【Farm Romance】

01:35.759 --> 01:37.970
[Episode 18]

01:38.180 --> 01:39.900
Did Black Tiger Village give you wine?

01:41.190 --> 01:41.920
If you have no money,

01:41.940 --> 01:43.030
How do you recycle the wine?

01:43.539 --> 01:44.100
This is a secret.

01:46.600 --> 01:48.030
Well, I don't want to know either.

01:51.729 --> 01:52.210
Incidentally,

01:52.910 --> 01:53.910
Have you thought about the name of the dish?

01:54.520 --> 01:56.000
Soon you will be able to purchase a store.

01:56.690 --> 01:57.950
If you want to run a good restaurant,

01:58.410 --> 01:59.479
There must be some star dishes.

01:59.840 --> 02:00.990
I remember when I was wearing a hat...

02:04.480 --> 02:05.450
I remember all the goodies

02:05.470 --> 02:06.860
Something to eat when I went there.

02:08.660 --> 02:09.270
I already have this thing.

02:10.530 --> 02:11.140
That?

02:12.340 --> 02:12.900
This is a secret.

02:15.890 --> 02:17.000
Now everything is ready,

02:17.320 --> 02:18.140
We just need stores.

02:19.790 --> 02:20.360
do you think this

02:20.380 --> 02:21.310
pink

02:21.329 --> 02:22.500
Is this color good-looking or this color good-looking?

02:24.079 --> 02:25.110
I think

02:25.760 --> 02:26.730
As long as you draw it

02:27.130 --> 02:27.800
This is great.

02:30.510 --> 02:32.130
Any color you paint will look beautiful.

02:36.180 --> 02:37.590
I employ several employees.

02:37.780 --> 02:39.000
I already had an idea for an accounting firm.

02:39.160 --> 02:40.050
That's good!

02:40.740 --> 02:42.130
Tomorrow morning we go to the city

02:42.540 --> 02:44.140
Buy stores and open restaurants.

02:44.420 --> 02:45.760
[On sale]

02:47.230 --> 02:47.780
As?

02:48.130 --> 02:48.930
Are they booked?

02:49.500 --> 02:50.590
we woke up

02:50.610 --> 02:51.329
3 days is the deadline.

02:51.430 --> 02:52.540
Three days haven't come yet,

02:52.570 --> 02:53.800
Why let others book it?

02:54.010 --> 02:55.420
Are you two traders too?

02:55.680 --> 02:56.790
Asaphen

02:56.829 --> 02:57.610
First comer rule.

02:57.860 --> 02:58.740
Moreover, between us,

02:59.270 --> 03:00.150
no deposit

03:00.360 --> 03:01.240
We don't have a contract either.

03:01.660 --> 03:02.400
This three-day period

03:02.420 --> 03:03.590
This is a verbal agreement.

03:03.930 --> 03:05.090
So why can't we change?

03:05.250 --> 03:06.890
You didn't keep your promise, did you?

03:06.930 --> 03:07.940
- Why don't I obey...?
-Mana.

03:08.820 --> 03:09.390
boss,

03:10.340 --> 03:11.560
Can we talk somewhere else?

03:12.630 --> 03:13.030
OK

03:23.280 --> 03:23.930
boss,

03:25.270 --> 03:26.450
I tell you the truth.

03:28.360 --> 03:30.100
My cousin and I have been devoted to each other since childhood.

03:30.130 --> 03:31.240
We have been planning to get married for a long time.

03:32.040 --> 03:33.050
But recently,

03:35.210 --> 03:36.010
The doctor said...

03:42.160 --> 03:43.070
It's hard to explain.

03:48.860 --> 03:51.090
It seems this is not easy for you.

03:53.190 --> 03:54.700
But what does it matter

03:54.730 --> 03:55.520
Buying a store?

03:55.860 --> 03:57.079
He doesn't know about my cousin's family

03:57.100 --> 03:58.150
He has only given birth to one child in 4 generations.

03:58.590 --> 03:59.280
But at this point,

03:59.540 --> 04:00.820
It's just a girl.

04:01.050 --> 04:02.330
your greatest wish

04:03.250 --> 04:04.960
Just open a tavern like this.

04:05.540 --> 04:07.010
So you can spread the word about your family wine

04:07.060 --> 04:07.940
all over the world.

04:08.510 --> 04:09.790
But now he can't buy the store.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.150
So what should you do?

04:11.780 --> 04:12.310
Mr. Señorito,

04:12.790 --> 04:14.110
I understand your difficulty.

04:14.530 --> 04:16.130
But I accepted someone else’s deposit.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.200
If I regret it now

04:17.680 --> 04:18.420
I will offend him

04:18.440 --> 04:20.079
The compensation deposit will be tripled.

04:20.459 --> 04:21.950
Sir, this...

04:22.310 --> 04:24.430
You'd better think differently.

04:24.700 --> 04:25.460
sorry.

04:25.900 --> 04:26.700
sorry.

04:30.290 --> 04:30.900
Prima.

04:36.070 --> 04:36.970
I'm just a useless person

04:38.000 --> 04:38.880
I can't help you achieve it

04:38.900 --> 04:40.220
You want to open a tavern.

04:43.230 --> 04:44.260
Primo,

04:45.060 --> 04:46.090
this is not your fault.

04:47.490 --> 04:49.450
You have done everything possible.

04:49.760 --> 04:51.210
But now we can't buy the store

04:51.840 --> 04:53.290
And there is a lot of wine at home.

04:54.010 --> 04:54.800
So what should we do?

04:54.820 --> 04:56.380
it's my Life.

04:57.810 --> 04:58.820
cannot

04:59.360 --> 05:01.150
Develop and make wine famous

05:01.610 --> 05:02.640
my ancestors.

05:03.670 --> 05:05.600
cousin, future

05:05.830 --> 05:06.990
let us live again

05:07.030 --> 05:08.230
our own lives.

05:09.000 --> 05:09.910
unnecessary

05:11.420 --> 05:12.660
Let's mention these things.

05:13.020 --> 05:14.530
But I feel bad.

05:15.280 --> 05:16.480
I feel really bad.

05:17.660 --> 05:18.330
Your dad?

05:19.190 --> 05:20.310
Yes.

05:20.940 --> 05:21.880
This fact

05:22.360 --> 05:24.320
How do I explain this to my dad?

05:25.220 --> 05:26.840
If my dad knew

05:27.640 --> 05:31.400
It definitely drives us apart.

05:33.620 --> 05:34.190
Prima,

05:35.580 --> 05:36.900
Maybe today, after leaving here

05:38.390 --> 05:39.380
it's time

05:39.400 --> 05:40.370
Our farewell.

05:42.110 --> 05:43.080
I'm thinking

05:44.360 --> 05:45.870
when the tavern opens

05:47.550 --> 05:48.159
let's make money,

05:49.060 --> 05:49.740
we can go find

05:49.780 --> 05:50.700
Where there is a lake.

05:52.170 --> 05:53.290
Where there are mountains

05:53.850 --> 05:54.610
and fish in the lake.

05:55.620 --> 05:56.960
Let's cut rice together

05:57.590 --> 05:58.470
Let's roast taro together.

05:59.500 --> 06:00.640
We do housework together.

06:03.220 --> 06:04.760
we argue about money

06:05.280 --> 06:06.650
Until our faces were red.

06:05.970 --> 06:09.310
♫The wind blows through the rice fields♫

06:09.520 --> 06:12.910
♫Take the cigarette with you♫

06:14.400 --> 06:18.160
♫The birds stay next to the branches♫

06:18.520 --> 06:22.360
♫Looking from a distance♫

06:22.780 --> 06:25.410
♫Ir a contracorriente♫

06:26.790 --> 06:29.500
♫My origin♫

06:29.770 --> 06:31.670
Why do you eat so much?

06:30.050 --> 06:33.720
♫Rotating Pen♫

06:31.900 --> 06:33.140
And you do nothing.

06:34.520 --> 06:35.620
What happens if you take more?

06:39.400 --> 06:43.159
♫See you in the cloud♫

06:41.810 --> 06:42.380
There is a fish.

06:43.220 --> 06:43.700
Pez.

06:43.280 --> 06:46.640
♫I light incense to fulfill my wish♫

06:45.590 --> 06:46.480
liar.

06:47.780 --> 06:51.310
♫A puff of smoke♫

06:52.130 --> 06:53.700
It's very hot. What are you doing?

06:56.240 --> 06:59.790
♫Residual memory♫

07:01.750 --> 07:03.430
♫Keep it in your heart♫

07:04.580 --> 07:05.260
Mannar.

07:07.340 --> 07:08.390
Life is short.

07:09.620 --> 07:10.610
If the last day has been decided

07:11.790 --> 07:12.990
Much better than before coming here

07:14.650 --> 07:15.720
We don't talk about life and death

07:16.330 --> 07:17.100
We don't talk about the future

07:17.310 --> 07:18.430
Let us live in harmony.

07:20.990 --> 07:21.580
Although

07:21.790 --> 07:22.670
Let's just stay for one day.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.810
Even if it's only a few hours,

07:26.320 --> 07:27.460
we must be together

07:27.480 --> 07:28.170
Carefree.

07:32.330 --> 07:32.860
OK?

07:34.540 --> 07:35.460
I still want

07:35.480 --> 07:36.450
local identity.

07:37.330 --> 07:38.380
under certain circumstances

07:38.400 --> 07:39.050
Without alerting the enemy,

07:40.150 --> 07:41.790
I am waiting for the opportunity to approach Jinyang Bank.

07:44.770 --> 07:45.290
mannar,

07:49.790 --> 07:51.620
I really need your help.
I promise you.

08:08.530 --> 08:09.120
All right?

08:12.250 --> 08:13.740
What a beautiful couple!

08:22.040 --> 08:22.900
so me too

08:22.940 --> 08:24.260
I should call you cousin, shouldn't I?

08:26.700 --> 08:27.310
Shen Dong,

08:28.080 --> 08:29.050
since when

08:29.070 --> 08:30.350
Are you and Marner committed?

08:31.000 --> 08:31.400
this...

08:31.780 --> 08:32.880
what are they doing?

08:33.740 --> 08:34.600
this performance

08:34.620 --> 08:37.080
It's all about buying a store for a man in love.

08:37.580 --> 08:38.900
I'm afraid Man'er even believed it herself.

08:39.909 --> 08:41.440
I just came to shop with my cousin.

08:41.659 --> 08:42.580
I saw the boss was in trouble

08:42.830 --> 08:43.840
so i'm excited

08:44.090 --> 08:45.310
I spoke my mind.

08:46.210 --> 08:47.180
Right, cousin?

08:51.970 --> 08:52.620
I go first.

08:57.300 --> 08:58.130
OK

08:58.460 --> 08:59.550
They let me

08:59.590 --> 09:00.560
A play?

09:01.070 --> 09:02.830
I am even touched by your love.

09:03.330 --> 09:04.240
It doesn't matter what you say or how many words you say

09:04.740 --> 09:06.130
this store

09:06.300 --> 09:07.350
I won't sell it to you.

09:08.940 --> 09:09.550
Mr. Song,

09:10.310 --> 09:11.060
please come in.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.250
Let's go to negotiate today

09:13.440 --> 09:13.960
Property Contract.

09:14.450 --> 09:16.080
Did you two buy this store?

09:18.210 --> 09:18.730
Yes.

09:19.220 --> 09:19.830
Primo.

09:21.060 --> 09:21.460
Thanks.

09:21.570 --> 09:22.010
please.

09:39.150 --> 09:39.680
Miss Marner.

09:40.470 --> 09:41.820
Why did you come back alone?

09:45.410 --> 09:47.360
How was the purchase from that store?

09:49.300 --> 09:51.060
We didn't get it, it was taken away by others.

09:51.460 --> 09:52.490
then we can

09:52.510 --> 09:53.560
Check out other stores?

09:54.210 --> 09:54.800
have no idea.

09:55.940 --> 09:56.350
No.

09:57.280 --> 09:58.080
This matter is very important

09:58.100 --> 09:58.830
For Mr.

09:58.860 --> 09:59.440
How did you...?

09:59.460 --> 10:00.110
Why can't I do it?

10:01.420 --> 10:02.030
Now that your Lord has come

10:02.070 --> 10:03.270
al Pueblo Yingzi

10:03.290 --> 10:04.570
I've helped him a lot.

10:05.030 --> 10:06.140
Now you can’t buy it in the store

10:06.230 --> 10:07.190
Do you blame me?

10:07.470 --> 10:07.950
Yo...

10:08.180 --> 10:09.250
in your heart,

10:09.500 --> 10:10.450
in the heart of your Lord,

10:10.580 --> 10:11.730
the most important

10:11.750 --> 10:12.400
They are your stuff.

10:13.770 --> 10:14.720
In the meantime, you can use

10:15.030 --> 10:16.060
and deceive others.

10:17.700 --> 10:18.470
It doesn't matter

10:18.730 --> 10:19.780
What do others think?

10:27.950 --> 10:28.690
Miss Manner,

10:30.340 --> 10:31.440
what is more important

10:31.630 --> 10:33.070
For Mr.

10:33.750 --> 10:35.360
Don’t you know yet?

10:39.310 --> 10:40.590
Before returning from Black Tiger Village,

10:41.830 --> 10:43.050
This person has a chance

10:43.070 --> 10:44.020
Restore the ledger.

10:45.810 --> 10:46.670
but when he found out

10:46.830 --> 10:48.180
That wine is yours,

10:49.350 --> 10:50.090
he asked him

10:50.110 --> 10:51.440
Yu Xiangjin returned it.

10:52.130 --> 10:53.470
Yu Xiangjin made things difficult for him

10:53.910 --> 10:55.190
and let him make a choice

10:55.220 --> 10:55.850
Ledgers and wine.

10:56.180 --> 10:57.590
He chose wine without hesitation.

10:58.870 --> 10:59.940
He gave up the test

10:59.960 --> 11:00.970
He achieved this through his own hard work.

11:01.980 --> 11:02.550
is now

11:02.590 --> 11:03.560
We'll get the ledgers,

11:03.700 --> 11:05.110
We had long since returned to the capital to report this fact.

11:05.720 --> 11:06.350
we will not

11:06.370 --> 11:07.900
I had to go around a lot.

11:12.460 --> 11:14.860
He never told me any of this.

11:16.810 --> 11:17.880
it has many things

11:17.920 --> 11:19.100
Who can't be honest with you.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.690
I know it's because you care

11:22.590 --> 11:23.700
That's why you're so angry right now.

11:24.120 --> 11:24.690
real?

11:27.710 --> 11:28.850
Don’t you know anything yet?

11:28.870 --> 11:30.000
Does the host feel it?

11:59.460 --> 12:00.060
Lian Man'er,

12:03.400 --> 12:04.470
Has anything happened to you before?

12:05.190 --> 12:06.030
I'm about to convince

12:06.070 --> 12:06.790
To that boss.

12:07.350 --> 12:08.300
Why did you leave like this?

12:11.850 --> 12:12.980
Now we can't buy the store,

12:13.510 --> 12:14.070
I missed

12:14.100 --> 12:15.110
Have the opportunity to contact Jinyang Bank.

12:15.710 --> 12:16.320
Looking at the eastern market,

12:16.340 --> 12:17.480
Currently only available in this store.

12:17.520 --> 12:18.090

14:06.130 --> 14:07.600
eat more.

14:09.740 --> 14:10.220
Mannar.

14:11.100 --> 14:11.970
Try this.

14:14.630 --> 14:15.220
Thoma.

14:16.310 --> 14:16.820
eat more.

14:17.760 --> 14:19.530
The chicken smells amazing.

14:19.550 --> 14:21.140
Come on, be careful, be careful.

14:21.920 --> 14:22.800
Also try this.

14:22.930 --> 14:24.440
This eggplant is your favorite.

14:25.810 --> 14:26.570
eat vegetable.

14:26.820 --> 14:27.430
Are you OK

14:27.450 --> 14:28.600
What if we eat them separately?

14:36.770 --> 14:37.910
I heard your mother say

14:38.580 --> 14:40.280
Which store do they want to buy from

14:40.340 --> 14:41.460
Was it bought by Hua'er?

14:43.030 --> 14:43.430
so,

14:43.850 --> 14:45.260
What will they do once the restaurant opens?

14:45.580 --> 14:46.310
the entire eastern market

14:46.330 --> 14:47.760
Available in only one store.

14:48.160 --> 14:49.250
I think in a very short time,

14:49.820 --> 14:50.810
It's hard to find another one.

14:51.310 --> 14:52.300
Why didn't they tell me before?

14:52.590 --> 14:53.940
I remember Chun Zhu’s family,

14:53.960 --> 14:55.970
They have an empty store in Eastern Market.

14:56.200 --> 14:57.150
It shouldn't be far.

14:57.820 --> 14:58.830
How big is that store?

14:59.310 --> 15:00.550
Are there tables and chairs?

15:00.910 --> 15:02.320
I only know

15:02.340 --> 15:03.980
They have an empty store.

15:04.310 --> 15:05.340
I have no idea

15:05.340 --> 15:06.180
About the details.

15:06.670 --> 15:08.030
Pero Huaer

15:08.070 --> 15:09.290
It seems he is going to open a restaurant too.

15:09.310 --> 15:11.230
I'm afraid it wouldn't be good for them to drive next to each other.

15:12.460 --> 15:13.680
There used to be two famous restaurants.

15:14.190 --> 15:14.900
One of them is called Yuqingtang.

15:14.920 --> 15:15.780
The other room is called Qingyu Palace.

15:16.220 --> 15:17.480
The two locations are very close to each other.

15:17.950 --> 15:18.750
For 100 years,

15:19.020 --> 15:20.740
Both restaurants are doing very well.

15:21.370 --> 15:22.420
I think in business

15:22.610 --> 15:23.740
One person cannot become a monopoly.

15:23.980 --> 15:25.420
It also depends on comparison

15:25.990 --> 15:26.980
competing with,

15:27.000 --> 15:27.610
compete with each other

15:27.880 --> 15:29.160
It makes business better.

15:29.690 --> 15:30.320
I agree.

15:30.950 --> 15:32.320
Even if you want to open a restaurant,

15:32.340 --> 15:33.200
Sure

15:33.240 --> 15:34.080
I will do better than her.

15:34.630 --> 15:35.510
No matter which store it is,

15:35.930 --> 15:37.480
I can make that place the best and the biggest.

15:38.390 --> 15:38.770
dad,

15:39.020 --> 15:40.130
Where is this store?

15:40.760 --> 15:48.240
【Changle Tavern】

15:40.760 --> 15:48.240
[House for sale]

15:48.760 --> 15:49.390
You'd better delete

15:49.420 --> 15:50.630
What I said before.

15:50.930 --> 15:51.730
I take it back too.

15:55.760 --> 15:56.560
no problem.

15:56.960 --> 15:58.280
now we have

15:58.320 --> 15:58.970
It’s already the venue.

15:59.100 --> 15:59.810
We just lack staff.

16:00.700 --> 16:02.230
They are here and they are who they are.

16:05.130 --> 16:05.740
where are you going?

16:05.780 --> 16:07.420
The last one opened a store here,

16:07.440 --> 16:08.530
Destroyed in two months

16:08.700 --> 16:09.830
And they didn't even pay wages.

16:10.210 --> 16:11.300
They'd better find someone else.

16:14.410 --> 16:15.040
what are we going to do?

16:16.510 --> 16:17.420
no problem.

16:18.090 --> 16:19.080
Finding good workers is easy.

16:19.500 --> 16:20.630
But it's hard to find someone

16:20.710 --> 16:21.450
Do the math.

16:21.830 --> 16:22.480
Mira,

16:22.520 --> 16:23.780
Our good accountant

16:23.850 --> 16:25.400
Preparations have begun.

16:25.710 --> 16:26.280
OK

16:26.300 --> 16:27.020
very good.

16:35.590 --> 16:36.070
This is...?

16:37.020 --> 16:37.860
Did he make an effort to escape?

16:41.300 --> 16:42.420
Since we have this store,

16:43.380 --> 16:44.310
most urgent

16:45.060 --> 16:46.340
It brings everyone together.

16:49.580 --> 16:50.590
Contador?

16:51.910 --> 16:53.070
I've heard about uncle

16:53.110 --> 16:54.850
He is very good at calculating accounts and abacus.

16:54.980 --> 16:56.220
no one can compare

16:56.380 --> 16:57.620
Miles away from you.

16:58.230 --> 16:59.470
Although I saw it in our family

16:59.470 --> 17:00.710
They were separated.

17:00.940 --> 17:01.780
But my dad said this

17:01.930 --> 17:02.500
you

17:02.520 --> 17:03.610
That's exactly it

17:04.890 --> 17:05.780
Of course it is this one.

17:06.660 --> 17:08.530
As for the use of abacus,

17:08.990 --> 17:10.190
If your uncle dares to say that he is second

17:10.190 --> 17:11.380
No one dares to say that he is number one.

17:11.569 --> 17:12.540
No one dares to say that he is number one.

17:23.270 --> 17:23.710
uncle,

17:24.240 --> 17:25.329
I'll tell you directly.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.430
If you become my accountant.

17:27.619 --> 17:28.380
In the first three months,

17:28.440 --> 17:30.040
I will give you one tael of silver every month.

17:30.460 --> 17:31.530
When business gets better,

17:31.550 --> 17:32.350
I'll raise another 10 copper coins.

17:32.980 --> 17:34.220
If that's not enough for you,

17:34.700 --> 17:35.880
you can use your free time

17:35.900 --> 17:37.390
and bring in more customers.

17:37.490 --> 17:38.080
that moment,

17:38.380 --> 17:39.930
I will give you money

17:40.060 --> 17:40.860
Depends on the patrons entering the premises.

17:41.250 --> 17:41.840
Anyway,

17:42.620 --> 17:44.030
The better the business,

17:44.130 --> 17:45.350
The more money you make.

17:45.710 --> 17:46.820
Don't worry.

17:46.860 --> 17:47.980
In town, your uncle

17:48.000 --> 17:48.900
He has many friends.

17:49.170 --> 17:50.390
When that moment comes,

17:50.410 --> 17:51.420
Let them eat in our store.

17:51.950 --> 17:52.470
OK

17:53.190 --> 17:54.400
Right, Shouyi?

17:54.550 --> 17:55.460
Yeah.

17:59.380 --> 18:00.540
Ignore him.

18:00.670 --> 18:01.670
Get some pipes.

18:06.780 --> 18:07.320
uncle,

18:07.950 --> 18:08.820
We won't talk about other things.

18:09.220 --> 18:10.850
I also did my part to help you.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.040
To get you out of jail.

18:13.460 --> 18:14.840
This debt...

18:17.930 --> 18:18.480
mannar,

18:19.840 --> 18:21.290
Since my uncle doesn't want to,

18:21.610 --> 18:22.850
Let’s go back first.

18:23.500 --> 18:24.470
I still have many friends

18:24.470 --> 18:25.500
Who wants to work with us.

18:26.500 --> 18:26.900
let's go.

18:26.900 --> 18:27.450
brother.

18:27.910 --> 18:29.070
I'm leaving, Aunt He.

18:29.090 --> 18:29.950
We went back first.

18:30.330 --> 18:30.790
this...

18:32.700 --> 18:34.050
He didn't say he didn't want to either.

18:34.090 --> 18:34.760
this...

18:34.970 --> 18:35.540
Keep righteousness.

18:35.930 --> 18:36.840
say something.

18:37.890 --> 18:38.940
look look look.

18:38.940 --> 18:39.460
arts.

18:42.720 --> 18:43.540
It’s not that I don’t do it,

18:43.790 --> 18:45.030
If I don’t do it if I have money, wouldn’t I be stupid?

18:45.770 --> 18:46.290
do not you know

18:46.310 --> 18:47.240
How is our family doing?

18:47.550 --> 18:48.980
You are separated from your family.

18:49.420 --> 18:50.830
Uncle Lao and Aunt Gu are not here.

18:50.980 --> 18:52.320
With your grandma’s temperament,

18:52.450 --> 18:53.770
Can you allow us not to work from home?

18:53.810 --> 18:54.610
And work in the city?

18:56.460 --> 18:57.870
This is mostly because of your grandmother.

18:59.090 --> 19:00.050
Don't worry.

19:00.810 --> 19:02.320
If it's grandma's problem

19:02.780 --> 19:04.060
I have a solution.

19:05.180 --> 19:06.310
The premise is

19:06.540 --> 19:07.450
you two

19:07.910 --> 19:09.020
You must cooperate with me and take action.

19:10.220 --> 19:10.680
Behavior?

19:12.190 --> 19:12.740
Xiuer,

19:12.740 --> 19:13.960
Your brother said that

19:13.980 --> 19:14.990
when you take office

19:15.130 --> 19:16.580
He will find you a good husband.

19:17.020 --> 19:17.860
former teacher

19:17.860 --> 19:19.150
He said it would be soon.

19:19.310 --> 19:21.230
When I went to the city to be a rich wife,

19:21.500 --> 19:22.490
i will take you there

19:22.530 --> 19:23.490
For your enjoyment, what do you think?

19:24.230 --> 19:26.120
I know you are very filial.

19:27.380 --> 19:27.990
Mother!

19:29.880 --> 19:30.450
Mother!

19:30.870 --> 19:31.350
Mother!

19:31.390 --> 19:31.940
help me!

you have promised me

28:17.610 --> 28:19.040
No matter what business you do,

28:19.380 --> 28:20.660
One tael of silver per month

28:20.660 --> 28:21.730
You can't miss it.

28:22.740 --> 28:23.540
If I had known earlier,

28:23.560 --> 28:24.540
I would have gone to the flowers.

28:24.710 --> 28:25.470
one way or another,

28:25.470 --> 28:26.770
At least I can eat good food.

28:26.770 --> 28:27.480
this...

28:27.690 --> 28:28.680
You only tell the truth.

28:31.880 --> 28:33.530
Why am I so unlucky?

28:34.000 --> 28:34.750
I open a restaurant at the same time

28:34.790 --> 28:35.780
que Huaer.

28:36.540 --> 28:37.420
and its location

28:37.420 --> 28:38.200
and the scenes he created,

28:39.060 --> 28:40.170
How can I compete with her?

28:42.170 --> 28:43.430
It's time to come up with a solution.

28:45.110 --> 28:47.670
[song]

28:47.630 --> 28:48.570
The sheep belly is big,

28:48.740 --> 28:49.420
19 cents.

28:50.510 --> 28:52.190
Sugar cane, 14 cents.

28:53.870 --> 28:55.590
Chenzhou fruits cost 15 cents.

28:56.160 --> 28:57.520
Business has been very good recently.

28:58.220 --> 28:59.410
You have great taste.

28:59.750 --> 29:00.550
my mom and my brother

29:00.550 --> 29:01.870
Look how good our business is

29:01.890 --> 29:02.990
They complimented me on my success.

29:03.410 --> 29:04.160
tomorrow,

29:04.270 --> 29:05.630
I will invite people from the guild to come.

29:06.260 --> 29:06.730
Yes.

29:07.310 --> 29:08.070
Mr. Wu,

29:08.300 --> 29:09.390
Boss Wu will also come.

29:10.800 --> 29:11.410
Oh, really?

29:11.980 --> 29:13.660
When did I lie to you?

29:16.220 --> 29:17.730
Although the Song family runs a family business,

29:17.860 --> 29:18.740
But so is my brother

29:18.740 --> 29:20.380
It depends on Director Wu

29:20.380 --> 29:20.970
for your business

29:20.970 --> 29:21.890
getting bigger and bigger.

29:25.670 --> 29:26.280
Honey,

29:27.480 --> 29:28.680
I have a word

29:29.030 --> 29:30.440
I don't know if I should say it.

29:31.770 --> 29:32.940
I was just thinking

29:33.720 --> 29:35.000
If Boss Wu comes tomorrow

29:35.570 --> 29:37.560
We must treat it well.

29:38.650 --> 29:39.200
and then,

29:40.480 --> 29:41.720
see an opportunity

29:41.910 --> 29:42.820
Meet Director Wu and get closer.

29:44.660 --> 29:45.730
That's not good, don't you think?

29:47.120 --> 29:48.320
never.

29:49.120 --> 29:49.940
if you could get closer

29:49.940 --> 29:50.990
Director Wu,

29:51.150 --> 29:52.370
heads of guilds

29:52.390 --> 29:53.630
I believe they will give you face.

29:54.240 --> 29:55.190
At that time, not only

29:55.210 --> 29:56.700
They come to our restaurant often.

29:56.740 --> 29:57.790
maybe in the future

29:57.790 --> 29:59.140
we can work together

30:00.100 --> 30:01.240
Do other things.

30:04.810 --> 30:06.620
As long as you have real ability,

30:06.910 --> 30:08.230
You will be able to establish your position in the family and house.

30:08.700 --> 30:09.850
everyone in the family,

30:09.870 --> 30:10.880
He will be able to respect you and treat you well.

30:15.330 --> 30:16.170
you're right.

30:23.630 --> 30:24.740
So many days have passed.

30:26.630 --> 30:27.540
name changed

30:27.870 --> 30:28.990
Board twice.

30:29.830 --> 30:31.150
Why isn't business improving?

30:32.560 --> 30:33.440
Not in a hurry.

30:34.570 --> 30:35.290
what happened?

30:35.390 --> 30:36.300
it's out of the question

30:36.300 --> 30:37.140
Everything is fine if you hurry up.

30:40.790 --> 30:41.590
If there is blame,

30:42.410 --> 30:43.420
You should blame your dad and me.

30:43.840 --> 30:44.800
we are farmers

30:45.500 --> 30:46.300
and within a short period of time,

30:46.320 --> 30:46.990
we cannot propose

30:46.990 --> 30:48.150
a good idea.

30:48.150 --> 30:49.590
Mom, that's not what I meant.

30:50.880 --> 30:51.970
I just want to say

30:52.730 --> 30:54.050
Our store location

30:54.090 --> 30:55.250
It's just too far away.

30:56.130 --> 30:58.630
Business may not pick up.

30:59.990 --> 31:01.150
I do not think so.

31:02.470 --> 31:03.230
Know?

31:04.260 --> 31:05.980
When you were a child,

31:05.980 --> 31:07.510
Your father and I went to the city once.

31:08.440 --> 31:09.850
I saw a place called

31:10.370 --> 31:12.030
Mrs. Wang's shop sells pickles.

31:12.350 --> 31:13.250
the location of that store

31:13.290 --> 31:14.170
It's also very remote.

31:14.420 --> 31:15.660
I was in an alley

31:16.930 --> 31:18.670
and those who buy their vegetables in salt water

31:18.670 --> 31:20.470
They lined up on the street outside.

31:20.900 --> 31:21.590
indeed

31:21.610 --> 31:22.980
If the wine is good, you will not be afraid of deep alleys.

31:23.080 --> 31:24.800
As long as the food is delicious,

31:24.910 --> 31:26.060
No matter how far the place is,

31:26.130 --> 31:27.780
Customers will come because of its popularity.

31:30.890 --> 31:32.810
If the wine is good, you will not be afraid of deep alleys.

31:34.670 --> 31:36.040
First there has to be wine.

31:40.140 --> 31:40.700
Mother,

31:41.840 --> 31:43.010
if your daughter

31:44.150 --> 31:45.830
Lose all your money?

31:47.910 --> 31:49.110
So what should you do?

31:49.380 --> 31:50.790
Dad and I will take care of you.

31:51.400 --> 31:53.080
Would I let my daughter skip meals?

32:00.220 --> 32:01.230
some days ago,

32:02.010 --> 32:03.330
your grandmother and your grandfather

32:04.320 --> 32:05.600
They asked people to write to me.

32:06.210 --> 32:07.240
They said they missed me.

32:08.890 --> 32:10.010
so i want

32:11.460 --> 32:12.150
this time,

32:12.630 --> 32:13.980
I shouldn't have let them come.

32:14.420 --> 32:15.260
i should come back

32:15.360 --> 32:16.350
Go and see them.

32:17.630 --> 32:18.260
that's why,

32:18.810 --> 32:20.160
before i leave,

32:20.640 --> 32:21.670
I have to extract all

32:21.710 --> 32:22.550
These radishes.

32:23.260 --> 32:24.420
Place them in salt water as soon as possible.

32:25.870 --> 32:27.230
in winter,

32:27.650 --> 32:29.170
No fresh vegetables either.

32:29.540 --> 32:30.300
your dad

32:30.660 --> 32:32.420
Waiting for my pickles

32:32.550 --> 32:33.560
Eat with rice.

32:36.940 --> 32:37.440
Mother,

32:38.700 --> 32:39.780
What did I just say?

32:40.470 --> 32:41.460
I said your dad,

32:41.500 --> 32:42.570
Still waiting for my pickled radish

32:42.610 --> 32:43.370
Eat with rice.

32:43.620 --> 32:44.270
previous sentence.

32:44.900 --> 32:46.100
in winter,

32:46.220 --> 32:47.740
No fresh vegetables either.

32:49.560 --> 32:50.260
Excellent!

32:51.750 --> 32:52.720
I already know what wine is.

32:53.770 --> 32:54.710
I already know.

32:54.860 --> 32:56.180
I already know what wine is.

32:56.180 --> 32:56.750
you you……

32:58.240 --> 32:59.160
What did I say?

33:06.470 --> 33:08.260
No business, no business.

33:09.710 --> 33:11.500
Why is there no business?

33:12.900 --> 33:13.470
Shisan.

33:13.910 --> 33:14.690
tomorrow morning,

33:14.710 --> 33:16.030
Taking some villagers up the mountain with me.

33:16.520 --> 33:16.980
yes,

33:17.250 --> 33:17.920
Needed tomorrow

33:17.960 --> 33:18.870
your blush and lip balm

33:18.970 --> 33:19.980
Come with me to the restaurant.

33:21.010 --> 33:21.710
it's time

33:22.020 --> 33:23.170
Use my last tactic.

33:28.180 --> 33:29.250
Finally someone went crazy.

33:41.090 --> 33:41.600
Are you already here?

33:42.820 --> 33:43.260
arts.

34:14.710 --> 34:15.270
arts.

34:21.570 --> 34:22.620
thanks for your help.

34:22.810 --> 34:23.800
When everything is done,

34:24.030 --> 34:26.130
I will invite you to the restaurant for dinner.

34:26.380 --> 34:28.040
OK, OK, OK.

34:53.989 --> 34:55.770
Where do these fresh vegetables come from?

34:55.790 --> 34:56.550
allow.

34:57.330 --> 34:58.940
There are fresh vegetables here.

34:58.970 --> 34:59.760
allow.

35:00.060 --> 35:01.420
There are fresh vegetables here.

35:02.030 --> 35:03.440
come and see.

35:04.010 --> 35:05.410
Permission, permission.

35:12.830 --> 35:13.990
This fresh cucumber.

35:14.010 --> 35:14.780
Excellent!

35:15.500 --> 35:16.780
We could use something fresh.

35:16.970 --> 35:18.190
come and see.

35:18.460 --> 35:19.570
The freshest vegetables.

35:20.160 --> 35:21.130
I've never heard of it.

35:21.300 --> 35:21.950
Where do so many come from?

35:21.950 --> 35:22.470
Are there any fresh vegetables in winter?

35:22.470 --> 35:23.750
Come on, let's go and see.

35:24.110 --> 35:24.780
Since the beginning of winter,

35:24.930 --> 35:26.320
We haven’t had fresh vegetables in our house yet.

35:26.480 --> 35:27.530
We'll see.

35:34.910 --> 35:36.060
I am coming.

35:36.340 --> 35:37.320
fresh vegetables.

35:37.490 --> 35:38.350
allow.

35:39.570 --> 35:40.810
fresh vegetables.

35:41.460 --> 35:42.450
This is the place.

35:43.790 --> 35:45.790
Welcome to Yizhaoxian.

35:45.920 --> 35:47.950
Please come in.

35:50.390 --> 35:51.900
let's go.

35:51.900 --> 35:52.620
well.

35:52.620 --> 35:53.980
Zhao, come on, come on.

35:53.980 --> 35:55.350
Come in, sir.

35:55.430 --> 35:56.750
Come and get your number.

35:56.780 --> 35:57.910
If someone misses his turn,

35:58.100 --> 35:59.050
Then you have to wait for 3 tables.

35:59.050 --> 35:59.760
all,

36:00.030 --> 36:00.870
listen to me.

36:00.870 --> 36:02.340
All the people who come to the restaurant to eat are girls.

36:02.360 --> 36:04.440
They have free makeup and manicure.

36:04.470 --> 36:05.830
Colorful

36:05.870 --> 36:06.350
And today's most popular makeup.

36:06.360 --> 36:07.390
let me see.

36:07.740 --> 36:08.580
What is manicure?

36:08.620 --> 36:09.110
I am coming.

36:09.460 --> 36:10.510
Spicy soup!

36:10.510 --> 36:11.710
Spicy soup!

36:11.860 --> 36:14.380
Have a bowl of spicy soup in winter

36:15.280 --> 36:17.990
Warm your stomach and your body will feel better.

36:18.030 --> 36:18.980
What is spicy soup?

36:19.990 --> 36:20.830
friend,

36:21.580 --> 36:22.720
This is a special dish

36:22.740 --> 36:23.500
from our store.

36:23.620 --> 36:25.110
Hot vegetables in spicy soup.

36:25.390 --> 36:26.420
We chose fresh vegetables

36:26.440 --> 36:27.090
Not in winter.

36:27.110 --> 36:27.910
It is made from fire.

36:28.100 --> 36:29.500
Spicy and hot.

36:30.390 --> 36:30.910
all,

36:31.500 --> 36:32.840
yes winter

36:32.870 --> 36:33.470
they eat one

36:33.540 --> 36:34.690
Hot and spicy soup,

36:34.970 --> 36:36.630
Not only do they fill your stomach, they also warm your stomach.

36:36.650 --> 36:38.580
This is the best thing to do to warm your body this season.

36:39.060 --> 36:40.070
not only,

36:40.090 --> 36:40.930
yes everyone loves it

36:40.950 --> 36:42.150
Hot vegetables from here,

36:42.170 --> 36:43.310
You can book now.

36:43.370 --> 36:44.940
Main store

36:45.050 --> 36:46.180
He will deliver them to your home for free.

36:46.310 --> 36:47.260
well.

36:47.510 --> 36:47.990
Thanks.

36:48.260 --> 36:49.500
Apoenos, Apoenos.

36:49.940 --> 36:50.760
Let them take advantage.

36:51.770 --> 36:52.740
eat more.

36:53.260 --> 36:54.100
They opened a new store in the front.

36:54.500 --> 36:55.380
They said it wasn't bad.

36:55.470 --> 36:56.430
let's go.

37:22.650 --> 37:23.490
Where is Yi Zhaoxian?

37:24.440 --> 37:25.070
Mr. Wu,

37:25.700 --> 37:27.150
In front is Chunhuaixuan.

37:27.610 --> 37:28.450
We'll arrive soon.

37:28.470 --> 37:29.350
come on.

37:32.020 --> 37:33.470
Their dishes are weird.

37:33.740 --> 37:35.470
Yes, there was a long queue at the door.

37:36.890 --> 37:37.760
what happened?

37:39.310 --> 37:40.360
We have to eat a lot in a while.

37:41.180 --> 37:42.190
come on.

37:46.620 --> 37:47.750
It's coming, it's coming.

37:49.060 --> 37:50.020
How lively!

37:52.780 --> 37:54.180
A lot of people.

37:56.510 --> 37:58.620
Hurry up.

37:58.620 --> 37:59.750
just in front.

38:01.070 --> 38:01.790
quickly.

38:03.470 --> 38:04.030
There are so many people.

38:04.030 --> 38:04.940
How long do we have to wait?

38:04.940 --> 38:05.550
Honey.

38:06.740 --> 38:07.730
Didn’t Mr. Wu say that?

38:07.750 --> 38:08.720
Who will come to our restaurant?

38:09.850 --> 38:10.650
Why did he leave?

38:16.300 --> 38:17.290
Ten geese.

38:17.310 --> 38:18.130
Gentlemen.

38:18.130 --> 38:19.470
350 cents.

38:20.780 --> 38:22.310
Six hares.

38:22.790 --> 38:23.400
980 cents.

38:23.420 --> 38:24.500
Come on, I'm sorry.

38:25.020 --> 38:26.030
Ten chickens.

38:26.390 --> 38:26.990
allow.

38:27.820 --> 38:29.010
There is no problem with my account.

38:29.450 --> 38:30.340
Thanks, man.

38:30.460 --> 38:31.180
You're welcome.

38:32.420 --> 38:33.190
no problem.

38:39.100 --> 38:39.640
Mr. Wu,

38:40.610 --> 38:41.300
This place is too noisy.

38:41.740 --> 38:43.300
Let's go to Song's Restaurant.

38:49.910 --> 38:50.590
Not in a hurry.

38:52.860 --> 38:54.530
Waiter, private room.

38:58.080 --> 38:58.930
waiter.

39:00.730 --> 39:01.300
gentlemen,

39:02.310 --> 39:03.360
terribly sorry.

39:03.860 --> 39:04.680
here

39:04.700 --> 39:06.150
We didn't have a private room, just this big room.

39:07.540 --> 39:08.670
Although a bit simple,

39:08.670 --> 39:09.660
But we have exotic dishes

39:09.660 --> 39:10.840
and vegetables not in season.

39:11.260 --> 39:12.310
Do you want to try it first?

39:13.940 --> 39:15.750
Mr. Wu, why don't you...?

39:17.580 --> 39:19.390
Neither of you look like normal people.

39:19.660 --> 39:20.840
Must be used to it

39:20.860 --> 39:21.510
Seafood and very delicious stuff.

39:21.870 --> 39:22.430
Hey,

39:22.520 --> 39:23.820
why not

39:23.940 --> 39:24.660
Try something new in our store?

39:29.090 --> 39:29.620
OK

39:30.770 --> 39:31.490
Then I'll give it a try.

39:32.600 --> 39:33.100
forward.

39:33.460 --> 39:34.830
Gentlemen, here it is.

39:50.770 --> 39:51.650
Mr. Wu?

39:52.140 --> 39:53.160
Is it that one?

39:53.190 --> 39:55.030
Wu Zhonglian, president of banco de Jinyang?

39:56.300 --> 39:56.900
this is possible.

39:59.640 --> 40:00.640
Then let's take action based on the situation.

40:02.510 --> 40:03.980
Go ahead and give it a try.

40:17.580 --> 40:18.810
Here, sir.

40:19.910 --> 40:20.830
I've only heard of it

40:21.400 --> 40:23.310
This kind of delicacy exists in Sichuan.

40:24.340 --> 40:25.730
People who know this food

40:25.980 --> 40:27.050
Must be a very wise man

40:27.070 --> 40:27.700
who reads a lot

40:27.830 --> 40:28.500
And comes from a wealthy family.

40:29.340 --> 40:30.070
I have no idea

40:30.300 --> 40:31.750
What's this person's name?

40:33.770 --> 40:36.710
Mr. Wu, Wu Zhonglian, is the richest man in Jinyang County.

40:39.420 --> 40:40.660
It turns out to be Boss Wu.

40:41.520 --> 40:42.360
Nice to meet you.

40:43.600 --> 40:44.550
I was lucky enough to meet him today,

40:44.820 --> 40:46.140
It’s an honor for my little place.

40:46.980 --> 40:47.890
Very good boy.

40:48.870 --> 40:50.550
Do you know Mr. Wu?

40:51.100 --> 40:52.280
Mr. Wu is

40:52.300 --> 40:53.470
There is a very famous person here.

40:53.500 --> 40:54.950
everybody knows.

41:00.260 --> 41:01.860
Although the family is wealthy

41:02.230 --> 41:03.710
they store for winter

41:03.730 --> 41:04.610
In the vegetable cellar.

41:05.180 --> 41:06.270
But in this season,

41:06.420 --> 41:07.320
make people normal

41:07.340 --> 41:08.580
I can eat fresh vegetables.

41:09.730 --> 41:10.530
Chico,

41:11.180 --> 41:12.510
You are very capable.

41:13.310 --> 41:14.150
Thank you Mr. Wu.

41:14.880 --> 41:15.700
You walk around,

41:15.720 --> 41:16.880
I'm sure you've seen it all.

41:17.490 --> 41:18.620
Our tips

41:18.640 --> 41:19.330
in front of you,

41:19.610 --> 41:21.040
They are just childish coincidences.

41:25.240 --> 41:26.670
Doing business is not easy

41:26.710 --> 41:28.010
In this remote alley.

41:28.430 --> 41:29.590
do business

41:29.630 --> 41:30.620
How can it be so good?

41:30.800 --> 41:31.870
That's even harder.

41:32.360 --> 41:34.460
Attract customers with fresh vegetables

41:34.980 --> 41:37.300
And retain customers through makeup and manicure.

41:38.510 --> 41:39.230
Hey,

41:39.770 --> 41:41.310
I was impressed by them.

41:46.540 --> 41:47.340
Don't worry.

41:47.720 --> 41:49.960
I will come often in the future.

41:50.680 --> 41:51.620
Thank you Mr. Wu.

41:54.140 --> 41:54.860
Yo,

41:55.590 --> 41:56.470
I want to ask you a favor.

41:57.040 --> 41:58.760
Tell me nothing happened.

42:00.990 --> 42:01.980
I have heard

42:02.290 --> 42:03.570
Boss Wu takes control

42:03.600 --> 42:04.840
The only guild in Jinyang County.

42:05.020 --> 42:05.650
Jinyang Bank.

42:06.300 --> 42:07.480
it's an honor for me

42:07.880 --> 42:08.850
I was able to see him today.

42:09.580 --> 42:10.630
But as we say goodbye today

42:11.280 --> 42:12.670
Mr. Wu will be very busy,

42:12.920 --> 42:14.220
It is estimated that it will be difficult to meet again in the future.

42:15.110 --> 42:16.200
but if we have a chance

42:16.390 --> 42:17.330
Join a guild,

42:17.900 --> 42:18.850
we will have many opportunities

42:18.850 --> 42:19.860
Go see Mr. Wu.

42:20.800 --> 42:21.620
I was just thinking

42:21.790 --> 42:23.150
Learn more from you.

42:30.270 --> 42:30.820
Chico,

42:31.870 --> 42:33.280
You are very ambitious.

42:33.970 --> 42:35.440
so suddenly

42:35.480 --> 42:36.320
And you ask for this in return.

42:37.580 --> 42:38.720
Sir, you have misunderstood me.

42:39.470 --> 42:40.270
yes

42:40.310 --> 42:41.550
Just small villagers.

42:42.270 --> 42:43.340
it's not easy

42:43.360 --> 42:44.200
Open this restaurant.

42:44.940 --> 42:46.430
Since we opened this location,

42:46.930 --> 42:48.050
We haven't done business yet.

42:48.800 --> 42:49.870
This is because we have no other choice.

42:49.910 --> 42:50.860
We've thought of this solution.

42:51.910 --> 42:53.340
But these news

42:53.550 --> 42:54.260
I can't think of them

42:54.260 --> 42:55.100
all the time.

42:56.010 --> 42:57.480
If no one supports me in the future

42:57.980 --> 42:59.470
Business will not be easy.

43:02.160 --> 43:04.580
But today I met Mr. Wu.

43:05.120 --> 43:06.660
Anyone who is so lucky,

43:06.800 --> 43:07.960
You won't let him go, right?

43:11.870 --> 43:12.650
Chico,

43:14.320 --> 43:15.420
May I have your name?

43:16.820 --> 43:18.090
I'm from Yingzi Town,

43:18.420 --> 43:19.030
Shen Nuo.

43:19.930 --> 43:20.750
¿ Shen Nuo?

43:29.620 --> 43:31.190
I wonder if I can give you an address.

43:32.520 --> 43:34.280
I will choose some high-quality vegetables

43:34.390 --> 43:35.540
I will take them to his mansion.

43:36.170 --> 43:37.050
what do you think?

43:37.680 --> 43:39.720
I will cook more fresh dishes

43:39.890 --> 43:41.020
I'll bring it to you together.

43:49.340 --> 43:50.330
Thank you Mr. Wu.

43:50.860 --> 43:52.940
Please support me in the future.

43:59.510 --> 44:00.060
goodbye.
