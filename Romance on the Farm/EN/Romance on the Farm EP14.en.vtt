09:46.630 --> 09:47.910

09:47.940 --> 09:49.070
Already arrived at the mansion.

09:50.200 --> 09:50.790
this is unreasonable

09:50.830 --> 09:52.110
Have the bride's family come to the party.

09:52.750 --> 09:53.800
She is indeed a farmer

09:53.820 --> 09:54.470
Born in a small family,

09:54.510 --> 09:55.790
Although he married into our Song family,

09:55.830 --> 09:57.070
Still so rude.

09:57.220 --> 09:58.350
Not only is it impolite,

09:58.820 --> 10:00.060
But also shameless.

10:00.430 --> 10:01.670
have you seen someone

10:01.710 --> 10:02.700
Is shouting a business at a banquet?

10:03.100 --> 10:04.610
Also, today is the wedding.

10:08.500 --> 10:09.510
stop.

10:10.180 --> 10:11.780
I'm embarrassed to even say it.

10:47.990 --> 10:48.500
Mr. Wu.

10:52.430 --> 10:54.740
Song Haikun wanted to see him outside.

Mr. Wu,

11:08.470 --> 11:09.310
Prubelo.

11:20.090 --> 11:22.760
Due to the loss of the ledger,

11:23.070 --> 11:23.940
It is worth noting that

11:24.120 --> 11:25.340
He was always nervous.

11:26.480 --> 11:27.130
Now,

11:27.510 --> 11:28.890
You don't let him distribute the goods.

11:29.380 --> 11:30.410
Now he can't sit still

11:30.570 --> 11:34.140
That's why I used this wine to please him.

11:35.510 --> 11:38.450
If Master Song is so careful

11:38.490 --> 11:39.610
on important matters,

11:40.660 --> 11:41.650
i won't lose

11:46.480 --> 11:49.440
Since Mr. Song worked so hard

11:49.480 --> 11:50.640
To make up for it,

11:51.660 --> 11:55.150
We will give you this opportunity.

12:02.950 --> 12:03.700
Mr. Liu.

12:05.820 --> 12:07.740
Mr. Wu said the wine was very good.

12:09.230 --> 12:11.310
He asked for a hundred ships to sail to the capital.

12:11.850 --> 12:12.460
this time,

12:13.150 --> 12:14.500
Be careful.

12:14.920 --> 12:16.220
If you make another mistake...

12:16.580 --> 12:17.480
Mr. Wu, don't worry.

12:17.730 --> 12:18.410

You have lost the jade pendant he gave you

13:14.330 --> 13:15.610
Before you marry into our Song family

13:15.820 --> 13:17.710
You also bought fake ones to fool us.

Not only was he in debt when he got married,

13:20.550 --> 13:21.510

I know what I did wrong.

14:08.590 --> 14:09.700
Why do you say that?

14:10.040 --> 14:11.170
i have always been loyal

14:11.460 --> 14:12.980
To my husband.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.530
Even if you give me ten courages

14:14.830 --> 14:16.300
I dare not set a trap for my husband.

14:16.320 --> 14:17.330
did you know

14:18.040 --> 14:20.810
Isn’t your husband my son?

14:31.300 --> 14:31.910
have no idea.

14:33.360 --> 14:35.140
You marry into the Song family,

14:35.730 --> 14:38.160
Is it to support your big family?

14:39.050 --> 14:40.350
Mother-in-law, that's not what happened.

14:40.350 --> 14:41.420
Didn't your mother teach you?

14:41.670 --> 14:43.840
Aren't you going to disturb the ancestors?

14:46.990 --> 14:48.650
But you are happy too early

14:48.710 --> 14:50.140
for your plans.

14:51.190 --> 14:53.290
Although Shanghai Long is my son in name,

14:53.810 --> 14:55.690
In terms of talent and learning,

14:56.110 --> 14:57.280
She is just like her mother,

14:57.300 --> 14:58.710
He is very humble.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.810
He is mediocre and accomplishes nothing.

15:04.150 --> 15:05.310
Nor vying for the spotlight

15:05.350 --> 15:06.480
and his brothers.

15:07.510 --> 15:08.410
that's why,

15:08.810 --> 15:09.570
Although he wants

15:09.590 --> 15:11.290
Marry a country girl,

15:11.750 --> 15:12.910
I accepted.

15:17.070 --> 15:18.220
Below,

15:18.580 --> 15:20.220
As long as they live peacefully

15:21.100 --> 15:24.090
I will protect your food and clothing.

15:29.690 --> 15:30.790
I know, mother-in-law.

15:31.560 --> 15:33.670
Our lady is a kind person.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.070
But not me.

15:35.930 --> 15:36.880
Young master.

15:37.260 --> 15:38.290
Think wisely.

15:38.750 --> 15:41.190
What else are you hiding from this woman?

15:42.950 --> 15:43.920
have no idea.

15:45.160 --> 15:46.350
please tell me.

15:46.860 --> 15:47.630
Since you don't know,

15:47.720 --> 15:48.600
starting today,

15:49.150 --> 15:51.140
Monthly salary will be reduced by half

15:51.250 --> 15:52.260
And coal for the young owner.

15:52.680 --> 15:53.560
There will be three or four left

15:53.810 --> 15:55.470
Servant, that is.

15:55.870 --> 15:57.630
I really don't know, mother-in-law.

15:58.180 --> 15:59.460
please tell me.

16:04.670 --> 16:05.990
you will come back

16:06.020 --> 16:07.650
What does your cousin earn from your family?

16:07.820 --> 16:09.210
At the wedding reception.

16:09.670 --> 16:10.450
dongxiang,

16:10.910 --> 16:12.400
He took the young master to her room.

16:12.950 --> 16:13.580
Yes.

16:21.730 --> 16:22.320
Honey,

16:23.160 --> 16:24.310
when you get home,

16:24.330 --> 16:25.170
Remember to tell Maner

16:26.010 --> 16:27.150
The wine my brother ordered

16:27.420 --> 16:28.680
Commissioned by Section Chief Wu

16:28.930 --> 16:30.050
sent to the capital,

16:30.910 --> 16:31.830
Be especially careful

16:32.210 --> 16:33.470
And don't make any mistakes.

16:33.790 --> 16:34.960
Otherwise, eldest brother will blame me.

16:44.560 --> 16:45.340
What happened to the flowers?

16:49.650 --> 16:51.490
Did my mother give you a hard time?

16:53.050 --> 16:53.660
Honey,

16:53.680 --> 16:55.150
you told me

16:56.870 --> 16:57.800
you are son

16:57.820 --> 16:59.500
The most admired person in the Song family?

17:05.720 --> 17:06.829
My mother already told you.

17:07.630 --> 17:09.270
Then why did you lie to me?

17:09.670 --> 17:10.720
Today is the first day

17:10.740 --> 17:11.660
I married into the Song family,

17:12.780 --> 17:14.460
Have you already made me suffer so much?

17:20.839 --> 17:21.810
This is real

17:22.710 --> 17:23.910
I'm telling you this.

17:25.170 --> 17:26.109
but that is

17:26.109 --> 17:27.710
This way you will respect me.

17:30.080 --> 17:31.950
Although no one in the house said it

17:32.250 --> 17:33.510
They support me outside

17:33.510 --> 17:34.220
Have a good reputation,

17:34.260 --> 17:36.470
I know

17:36.790 --> 17:37.520
in a mansion

17:37.540 --> 17:38.630
They don't appreciate me very much.

17:39.680 --> 17:40.800
My mother despises my origin

17:40.820 --> 17:41.950
He doesn't want to be near me.

17:42.540 --> 17:43.450
My brother won't let me

17:43.490 --> 17:44.480
Managing a family business.

17:46.470 --> 17:47.370
He saw that I was bored,

17:47.750 --> 17:49.100
So he commissioned me to do something inconsequential

17:49.290 --> 17:50.210
For me to pass the time.

17:53.070 --> 17:53.590
did you know

17:53.630 --> 17:54.710
how much have i done

17:55.020 --> 17:56.150
marry you?

17:56.810 --> 17:58.130
Of course I know.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.480
So you have to trust me.

18:00.840 --> 18:01.550
I did not do it on purpose

18:01.570 --> 18:02.620
Betrayed you.

18:03.000 --> 18:03.460
but,

18:04.720 --> 18:06.800
It's hard to say.

18:13.230 --> 18:14.300
Honey, are you really angry?

18:17.860 --> 18:18.460
Honey,

18:19.030 --> 18:20.020
Don't worry.

18:20.540 --> 18:21.990
As long as we live peacefully

18:22.270 --> 18:22.900
and have our own lives

18:22.920 --> 18:24.120
behind closed doors,

18:24.390 --> 18:24.870
we can live well

18:24.870 --> 18:26.190
Inside the mansion.

18:34.980 --> 18:35.940
I'm not angry.

18:38.110 --> 18:41.360
All I've ever wanted is you

18:42.410 --> 18:43.950
But your identity.

18:54.550 --> 18:55.390
By the way, dear.

18:55.940 --> 18:56.800
You said that before

18:57.700 --> 18:59.130
Brother asked about Maner’s wine

18:59.170 --> 19:02.120
Commissioned by Section Chief Wu.

19:03.020 --> 19:04.260
Who is Boss Wu?

19:15.850 --> 19:16.380
Mannar.

19:17.470 --> 19:18.060
Youheng.

19:20.060 --> 19:20.770
this is my father

19:20.790 --> 19:21.990
Withdrawn from the bank.

19:22.130 --> 19:23.650
He said he would lend you the money without interest.

19:24.530 --> 19:25.310
Thank you, Youheng.

19:25.980 --> 19:27.430
Even though they are brothers, they still have to settle accounts.

19:27.620 --> 19:28.860
I can't break Mr. Kim's rules.

19:29.150 --> 19:30.750
I will pay the interest due.

19:31.130 --> 19:32.050
only you,

19:32.470 --> 19:33.390
You take it so seriously.

19:38.650 --> 19:39.590
Why is garlic added to peanuts?

19:39.610 --> 19:40.830
Are they tied up in alcohol containers?

19:40.940 --> 19:41.900
The recipe is already sold, right?

19:42.990 --> 19:44.030
Although the formula has been sold,

19:44.170 --> 19:45.750
peanut garlic

19:45.910 --> 19:47.240
they are more famous

19:47.260 --> 19:48.140
Than the alcohol just released.

19:48.790 --> 19:50.310
If I give peanuts to a customer buying wine,

19:50.600 --> 19:51.840
It doesn't cost me much.

19:52.030 --> 19:53.920
But I could use the fame of Garlic Peanuts

19:53.940 --> 19:54.990
to increase alcohol sales.

19:55.870 --> 19:56.710
You Heng, you are here.

19:57.450 --> 19:58.100
Mr. Lien.

20:03.430 --> 20:05.940
How much money did you borrow?

20:07.010 --> 20:07.740
Two hundred taels.

20:09.820 --> 20:12.030
Why should we do less?

20:12.760 --> 20:15.030
You also borrowed sixty taels

20:15.070 --> 20:16.060
to other lenders, right?

20:16.190 --> 20:18.370
That adds up to quite a bit.

20:18.900 --> 20:19.500
Apart from,

20:19.880 --> 20:21.310
Manager Liu

20:21.350 --> 20:22.280
And Manager Qin

20:22.400 --> 20:24.630
They are difficult to treat.

20:24.670 --> 20:25.740
What are you doing

20:25.760 --> 20:26.960
What if I can't get my money back?

20:27.240 --> 20:27.740
Mannar.

20:28.350 --> 20:29.110
Do you also borrow money from them?

20:29.130 --> 20:30.010
Give it to Manager Liu and the others?

20:32.780 --> 20:33.900
I have to buy raw materials.

20:34.480 --> 20:35.810
There are not enough wild grapes in the mountains.

20:36.390 --> 20:38.500
Also, I need more people.

20:40.550 --> 20:42.420
But you ask to do business on credit,

20:42.440 --> 20:43.870
I don't feel at peace.

20:43.960 --> 20:44.610
dad.

20:45.320 --> 20:46.630
Song Haikun

20:46.670 --> 20:48.160
He asked me for a hundred ships

20:48.200 --> 20:49.500
and said he would send them to the capital.

20:49.540 --> 20:50.220
must be for

20:50.240 --> 20:51.540
officials and nobles.

20:51.860 --> 20:53.960
If officials and nobles like to drink,

20:54.100 --> 20:55.490
They will demand a thousand ships from me,

20:55.510 --> 20:56.160
Or two thousand later.

20:56.460 --> 20:57.950
Then I can

20:57.970 --> 20:59.290
Earn a thousand taels of gold.

20:59.820 --> 21:01.160
Also, as long as I deliver wine

21:01.180 --> 21:02.630
to the person who picked it up

21:02.700 --> 21:03.620
Let's sign,

21:03.890 --> 21:05.450
Song Haikun gave me the money right away.

21:05.490 --> 21:06.220
Don't worry.

21:07.420 --> 21:08.560
Mr. Lian

21:08.890 --> 21:09.980
is right.

21:10.190 --> 21:11.310
Better to be careful.

21:11.710 --> 21:13.140
I will accompany you to deliver it later.

21:13.450 --> 21:14.100
unnecessary.

21:14.370 --> 21:15.210
After passing Pingfeng Mountain,

21:15.240 --> 21:16.080
Someone will pick it up.

21:16.390 --> 21:17.820
I have a day trip, which is more than enough time.

21:19.460 --> 21:20.150
Mannar.

21:20.190 --> 21:20.700
dad.

21:21.120 --> 21:22.710
Don't worry.

21:22.780 --> 21:23.260
Nothing will happen.

21:56.770 --> 21:57.880
where you want to stay

21:57.900 --> 21:58.990
This is very far away.

21:59.810 --> 22:00.400
I have no idea

22:00.440 --> 22:02.920
If you want to buy a house, rent land

22:02.940 --> 22:04.220
Or do you want bulls, horses, exotic animals?

22:06.120 --> 22:07.160
I don't buy anything.

22:07.730 --> 22:10.130
I want you to send me a message.

22:12.750 --> 22:13.470
they said

22:13.630 --> 22:15.550
You have a connection with the mountain people.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.440
Can you help me get there?

22:25.730 --> 22:26.550
in three days,

22:26.870 --> 22:28.990
A batch of goods will pass through Pingfeng Mountain.

22:29.980 --> 22:33.530
[Unlock location: Black Tiger Village]

22:41.220 --> 22:41.780
Throw.

22:44.940 --> 22:45.420
Are you OK?

22:45.900 --> 22:46.810
Have you asked clearly?

22:46.950 --> 22:47.640
Yes.

22:47.670 --> 22:48.700
As expected, it is the product of the Song family.

22:48.910 --> 22:50.500
But the runner didn't want to say anything more.

22:50.770 --> 22:52.080
Where did this news come from?

22:52.710 --> 22:53.610
Is there a queue at the back?

22:53.720 --> 22:54.470
Absolutely not.

22:54.510 --> 22:54.980
they do not know

22:54.980 --> 22:55.980
The location of our Black Tiger Village.

22:56.030 --> 22:57.180
we always meet

22:57.180 --> 22:57.980
The outpost at the foot of the mountain.

22:59.430 --> 23:00.270
It's the Song family again.

23:00.820 --> 23:02.180
How small the world is to the enemy!

23:02.850 --> 23:03.900
many of our colleagues

23:03.950 --> 23:05.230
They were forced up the mountain by the Song family.

23:05.880 --> 23:07.580
How can we steal from them this time,

23:08.130 --> 23:09.510
We must not miss this opportunity.

23:17.770 --> 23:19.260
Mr. Shen, what do you think?

23:20.390 --> 23:21.840
Work with us again.

23:23.400 --> 23:24.110
Throw.

23:24.700 --> 23:25.310
because of you...?

23:29.660 --> 23:30.710
we have lived here for a long time

23:30.710 --> 23:31.740
My friend and I

23:31.910 --> 23:33.500
We provide them with a lot of help.

23:34.340 --> 23:35.940
What you promise to return to us

23:35.980 --> 23:37.390
It is delayed.

23:37.790 --> 23:38.840
Now you let us

23:38.860 --> 23:39.890
May we rob the Song family again.

23:40.350 --> 23:40.750
It is not

23:40.770 --> 23:41.700
Appropriate?

23:47.980 --> 23:48.750
how about this?

23:50.580 --> 23:51.740
We will work with you one last time,

23:51.900 --> 23:52.430
Throw,

23:52.560 --> 23:53.840
Give things back to us.

23:54.190 --> 23:54.740
How about it?

23:56.550 --> 23:57.890
OK

23:58.980 --> 24:00.410
Shen, how are you?

24:01.710 --> 24:02.870
this time,

24:03.420 --> 24:04.700
what do you think?

24:15.900 --> 24:17.180
Last time we used distraction.

24:18.140 --> 24:18.690
this time,

24:19.800 --> 24:20.660
We will replace the false with the true.

24:21.460 --> 24:22.220
How about it?

24:29.170 --> 24:31.630
[Song Home]

24:29.550 --> 24:30.390
Urgent report!

24:36.420 --> 24:36.970
hurry up.

24:37.380 --> 24:38.710
The old gentleman was angry in the hall.

24:39.150 --> 24:40.390
Tell others to take care of him.

24:47.870 --> 24:48.390
Honey.

24:52.950 --> 24:54.060
Something happened?

24:54.590 --> 24:55.950
why do i feel like this

24:55.980 --> 24:57.190
Everyone in the house is panicking?

24:57.890 --> 24:58.900
that alcohol

24:58.920 --> 24:59.840
My brother asked Mana,

25:00.430 --> 25:01.460
Unfortunately

25:02.030 --> 25:03.710
It was lost in transit.

25:04.460 --> 25:05.890
Why is alcohol lost?

25:07.010 --> 25:07.910
According to insiders,

25:08.310 --> 25:09.920
The government took control of the wine and confiscated it.

25:10.720 --> 25:11.840
But my brother just asked,

25:12.590 --> 25:14.080
There is no government control.

25:14.230 --> 25:14.940
Not clear so far

25:15.660 --> 25:17.090
Who stole the wine.

25:18.920 --> 25:19.800
so,

25:20.220 --> 25:21.600
Will this matter affect Maner?

25:22.650 --> 25:23.180
certainly.

25:24.360 --> 25:25.170
The alcohol is lost,

25:25.550 --> 25:26.230
Sure

25:26.230 --> 25:27.300
Brother refuses to pay

25:27.490 --> 25:28.960
He would let Manner handle the matter himself.

25:30.870 --> 25:31.880
I'll tell you the details when I get back.

25:32.460 --> 25:33.930
Be careful on the road, my dear.

25:50.150 --> 25:50.870
Yes.

25:51.460 --> 25:52.860
Tang Jin.

25:52.990 --> 25:54.460
We don't want to go out.

25:54.500 --> 25:55.220
This is real.

25:55.660 --> 25:56.980
The boss is urging us.

25:59.710 --> 26:00.990
The boss can't pay the bills.

26:01.470 --> 26:02.150
Tang Jin.

26:03.830 --> 26:04.670
Man'er, you're back.

26:07.670 --> 26:08.390
Mr. Jin,

26:08.430 --> 26:09.270
Why are you here?

26:09.370 --> 26:10.720
Coincidentally,

26:10.740 --> 26:12.460
I met with two managers.

26:12.500 --> 26:13.550
They were going to find you.

26:14.080 --> 26:14.820
so

26:15.300 --> 26:16.310
I've talked to them.

26:17.330 --> 26:18.110
Miss Manner,

26:18.700 --> 26:20.510
Today we are here to settle accounts.

26:21.010 --> 26:23.660
Today you must return the money as agreed.

26:24.500 --> 26:25.150
Yes.

26:26.450 --> 26:27.440
Dear managers, I...

26:31.330 --> 26:33.110
They need to wait a little longer.

26:33.320 --> 26:34.330
Still have to wait?

26:34.880 --> 26:36.030
If you don't pay me back

26:36.220 --> 26:37.290
how should i explain to him

26:37.310 --> 26:38.300
To the boss?

26:38.380 --> 26:39.430
We can't.

26:39.980 --> 26:40.860
Don't worry.

26:41.470 --> 26:42.650
I will raise funds as soon as possible

26:42.670 --> 26:43.510
I'll give it back to you.

26:44.140 --> 26:44.750
solo...

26:45.060 --> 26:46.980
Give me a few more days, okay?

26:48.030 --> 26:49.690
They've given you many days.

26:50.380 --> 26:50.990
Look at you.

26:51.560 --> 26:53.070
Don't make it difficult for them

26:53.090 --> 26:54.080
to a girl

26:54.310 --> 26:56.430
There must be a reason why she can't refund the money.

26:56.870 --> 26:58.190
He didn't want to deny the debt.

26:58.550 --> 27:00.650
Moreover, it is only a few dozen taels.

27:00.800 --> 27:03.090
Why are you in such a hurry?

27:03.570 --> 27:05.230
We have to pay our bills.

27:05.270 --> 27:07.230
Listen to me, Miss Marner,

27:07.560 --> 27:09.160
I've seen her grow.

27:09.430 --> 27:10.710
I know what kind of person she is.

27:10.990 --> 27:11.620
Don't worry.

27:11.700 --> 27:12.940
All money will be returned to you.

27:12.980 --> 27:13.990
But Tang Jin,

27:14.540 --> 27:16.300
The boss is urging us.

27:18.700 --> 27:19.220
but...

27:20.940 --> 27:21.510
so,

27:22.940 --> 27:23.700
Within half a month,

27:25.060 --> 27:26.700
If Mannar cannot refund the money,

27:28.090 --> 27:29.600
I'll pay you, okay?

27:29.940 --> 27:32.100
Mr. Jin, you said so.

27:32.270 --> 27:34.620
Don’t deny it at that moment.

27:34.750 --> 27:36.220
When did I break my promise?

27:37.730 --> 27:38.400
Mr. King.

27:39.430 --> 27:40.880
I already owe you several hundred taels.

27:40.900 --> 27:41.570
Quiet.

27:42.180 --> 27:42.900
In business, this is normal

27:43.500 --> 27:44.870
This liquidity takes several days.

27:45.420 --> 27:45.980
of.

27:46.450 --> 27:48.190
Well, it's too late now.

27:48.190 --> 27:49.550
Leave first.

27:49.550 --> 27:49.950
but...

27:50.230 --> 27:51.220
Come to my house for a drink another day.

27:51.220 --> 27:52.620
Come on, now, now.

27:52.830 --> 27:53.460
in my place

27:53.610 --> 27:55.580
I keep the champion cognac

27:55.980 --> 27:57.750
From Miss Marner.

27:58.060 --> 27:59.200
Come and drink some other time.

27:59.220 --> 27:59.740
Yes, let's go.

27:59.790 --> 28:00.730
How will you explain it when you come back?

28:00.860 --> 28:01.910
We have agreed.

28:12.220 --> 28:12.790
you...

28:13.380 --> 28:14.990
Didn't you go deliver the wine today?

28:16.970 --> 28:18.520
Didn't the Song family give you money?

28:20.250 --> 28:21.720
The police took away the wine.

28:22.180 --> 28:23.270
Did the police take him away?

28:23.900 --> 28:24.620
what happened?

28:25.520 --> 28:26.380
tell me.

28:27.980 --> 28:29.510
This thing is very strange.

28:30.270 --> 28:31.440
I'm delivering goods.

28:31.670 --> 28:32.390
I just left town,

28:33.120 --> 28:34.910
controlled soldier

28:34.950 --> 28:35.660
I was arrested.

28:35.900 --> 28:36.610
they said

28:36.840 --> 28:38.520
The government is investigating the smuggling.

28:38.710 --> 28:39.360
but my alcohol

28:39.380 --> 28:40.540
There is already an official document.

28:41.150 --> 28:42.470
I haven't explained it yet

28:42.790 --> 28:44.550
These fierce

28:44.550 --> 28:45.140
they took away the alcohol

28:45.140 --> 28:46.020
Nothing was said.

28:47.470 --> 28:48.460
Contraband?

28:52.180 --> 28:53.120
some days ago,

28:53.770 --> 28:55.180
I was drinking with some officers.

28:55.940 --> 28:57.300
I didn't hear it.

29:00.430 --> 29:01.940
I'll take you to the administrative office tomorrow to inquire.

29:02.150 --> 29:03.390
Maybe we'll spend a little money,

29:03.410 --> 29:04.510
We can recycle alcohol.

29:06.460 --> 29:07.990
I just asked the administrative office.

29:08.650 --> 29:09.890
They told me nothing.

29:10.660 --> 29:11.900
All officials can say is:

29:11.990 --> 29:13.210
"I do not know I do not know".

29:14.130 --> 29:15.370
damn it!

29:18.100 --> 29:19.090
don't you think

29:19.230 --> 29:20.280
Is there anything strange about this?

29:21.630 --> 29:23.310
that moment,

29:23.330 --> 29:24.910
Did they produce any seizure documents?

29:29.530 --> 29:30.140
No?

29:30.620 --> 29:31.630
No, Mr. King.

29:32.800 --> 29:34.110
If they are not from the government

29:34.130 --> 29:34.780
Who will they be?

29:38.460 --> 29:39.670
Let me ask.

29:40.390 --> 29:41.060
Don't worry.

29:43.660 --> 29:44.990
I will not be able to take back this shipment

29:45.030 --> 29:46.180
For a while.

29:46.560 --> 29:48.290
Now I just have to make another batch.

29:49.060 --> 29:50.510
Pay back the money I'm owed.

29:51.180 --> 29:51.790
OK

29:52.470 --> 29:54.230
If you have any needs, please call Youheng

29:54.460 --> 29:55.430
to help you.

29:56.790 --> 29:58.500
Come back early and rest.

29:58.850 --> 30:00.110
Your parents are waiting for you anxiously.

30:00.470 --> 30:01.390
Thank you Mr. Kim.

30:01.940 --> 30:02.990
Okay, here I go.

30:03.980 --> 30:04.840
slowly.

30:04.860 --> 30:05.240
OK

30:05.830 --> 30:06.290
leave.

30:19.140 --> 30:20.380
It's great to be a civil servant.

30:21.620 --> 30:22.880
Look at my clothes,

30:23.070 --> 30:25.050
I feel most arrogant.

30:25.090 --> 30:26.120
Oops!

30:26.850 --> 30:27.930
Very good, San.

30:28.410 --> 30:29.670
you know these officials

30:29.710 --> 30:31.220
Do they always do things without conscience?

30:31.390 --> 30:33.220
Are you proud to wear this dress?

30:33.910 --> 30:34.880
But if you...

30:35.300 --> 30:35.970
you're right.

30:37.080 --> 30:37.990
Let me enjoy it a little bit.

30:38.030 --> 30:38.870
I'll take it off later.

30:38.890 --> 30:39.560
Yeah yeah.

30:39.860 --> 30:40.530
Do not make jokes.

30:40.950 --> 30:41.470
Open the box.

30:44.080 --> 30:45.150
Be careful.

30:50.630 --> 30:51.710
Why no gold, paratha or jewellery?

30:52.230 --> 30:53.220
Why only alcohol?

30:53.760 --> 30:55.440
Are we short of wine in Black Tiger Village?

30:56.100 --> 30:56.980
where did you get it

30:57.020 --> 30:57.840
Damn news?

30:57.940 --> 30:58.870
how could I know?

31:03.070 --> 31:03.700
this...

31:06.280 --> 31:06.810
OK

31:07.900 --> 31:08.530
All right.

31:09.410 --> 31:10.130
San, yes.

31:10.260 --> 31:10.950
Although

31:10.990 --> 31:12.380
This stuff isn't worth anything.

31:12.710 --> 31:13.180
us

31:13.380 --> 31:14.770
It can make the Song family angry,

31:14.790 --> 31:17.140
Our work is not in vain.

31:17.500 --> 31:18.470
But, Thirteen, you...

31:19.060 --> 31:19.860
you're right.

31:20.630 --> 31:21.770
is right.

31:22.020 --> 31:22.820
That is.

31:22.860 --> 31:23.700
is right.

31:24.460 --> 31:25.060
gentlemen.

31:25.130 --> 31:26.450
Yes, you are a bit fierce today.

31:26.660 --> 31:27.980
She's just a girl.

31:28.380 --> 31:29.500
Even though I'm a girl,

31:29.810 --> 31:31.200
Work for the Song family.

31:33.190 --> 31:34.220
Incidentally,

31:34.710 --> 31:36.580
Why is the Song family like a big family?

31:36.600 --> 31:37.480
ask

31:37.500 --> 31:38.990
to a weak girl

31:39.010 --> 31:39.710
Will that transport cargo?

31:40.150 --> 31:41.180
How do we know?

31:41.640 --> 31:44.370
What is that girl like?

31:44.710 --> 31:45.860
She is very beautiful.

31:45.900 --> 31:46.240
Yes?

31:46.260 --> 31:47.060
How is she beautiful?

31:47.610 --> 31:48.950
You and Shen Dong didn’t go,

31:49.030 --> 31:50.100
So they didn't see the scandal.

31:50.800 --> 31:51.510
When we steal goods,

31:51.530 --> 31:52.770
She scolded us, which made me angry.

31:53.380 --> 31:54.310
If I wasn't a gentle man to girls

31:54.330 --> 31:55.230
I originally wanted to take her to the village.

34:11.139 --> 34:12.659
The batch of wine that was stolen yesterday

34:17.820 --> 34:18.500
Shen.

34:19.820 --> 34:21.580
Although the wine is not valuable,

34:22.150 --> 34:22.989
my colleagues

34:23.030 --> 34:24.460
They stole it with great difficulty.

34:25.070 --> 34:25.980
if you could ask for anything

34:26.020 --> 34:27.530
de la Aldea Heihu,

34:27.969 --> 34:29.420
How do I explain this to my colleagues?

34:29.719 --> 34:31.210
How can I make people in the village respect me?

34:31.650 --> 34:32.469
Throw.

34:33.389 --> 34:35.030
This batch of wine is not from the Song family.

34:35.929 --> 34:37.070
But from a friend of mine.

34:37.860 --> 34:39.460
I didn't know anything before stealing.

34:42.150 --> 34:43.310
But this batch of wine is important.

34:43.330 --> 34:44.020
for me.

34:45.659 --> 34:46.420
Even if you don't want to give it to me

34:47.380 --> 34:48.260
You must give it to me.

34:50.550 --> 34:51.830
I'll take it.

35:01.430 --> 35:02.250
Shen Nuo.

35:02.720 --> 35:04.270
Even if you take away the ledger,

35:04.650 --> 35:05.890
I have many companions outside,

35:06.160 --> 35:07.090
Do you think

35:07.780 --> 35:08.720
You can leave this village

35:08.740 --> 35:10.090
Then, immediately?

35:12.510 --> 35:13.320
Today, alcohol

35:13.700 --> 35:16.180
As for the ledger, you can only choose one.

35:16.850 --> 35:17.880
Which one do you choose?

35:33.810 --> 35:35.230
It seems you chose alcohol.

35:37.230 --> 35:37.950
Throw.

35:39.370 --> 35:40.150
Please don't break your promise.

35:42.120 --> 35:42.880
Shen Nuo.

35:44.620 --> 35:47.190
Is there a problem with the Song family?

35:47.540 --> 35:49.460
Or Jinyang Bank?

35:54.180 --> 35:54.980
Jinyang Bank?

35:55.420 --> 35:56.660
I've seen the ledger.

35:58.320 --> 35:59.100
The record is

35:59.120 --> 36:00.270
owner's

36:00.280 --> 36:01.680
del banco de Jinyang.

36:03.170 --> 36:03.800
they are all celebrities

36:03.820 --> 36:05.670
In the county seat.

36:09.350 --> 36:10.320
thank you boss.

36:11.430 --> 36:12.380
I am a commoner,

36:12.670 --> 36:13.490
How could I have a problem

36:13.530 --> 36:14.290
With an important man?

36:16.830 --> 36:17.980
I just wanted to rip them off.

36:21.220 --> 36:21.890
you're right.

36:22.920 --> 36:24.260
you spent so much money

36:24.290 --> 36:25.080
to here

36:25.690 --> 36:26.890
You fight with me.

36:27.500 --> 36:28.550
I did not expect

36:29.030 --> 36:30.730
You will have a few glasses of wine.

36:32.410 --> 36:33.020
Is it worth it?

36:39.240 --> 36:39.810
Yes.

36:41.680 --> 36:42.960
She is very important to me.

36:45.690 --> 36:47.410
Is it the girl carrying the goods?

36:49.910 --> 36:50.690
See you later.

37:02.620 --> 37:03.530
Finally we came down from the mountain.

37:06.470 --> 37:07.370
gentlemen.

37:08.590 --> 37:09.830
Yu Xiangjin te ha dado

37:09.870 --> 37:10.690
Ledgers and alcohol, right?

37:13.950 --> 37:14.950
I traded my ledger for alcohol.

37:15.670 --> 37:16.680
We will return in a few days

37:16.700 --> 37:17.660
Take away any remaining alcohol.

37:17.710 --> 37:18.110
but...

37:20.020 --> 37:21.550
So what about returning to the capital?

37:24.200 --> 37:24.760
Shisan...

37:25.160 --> 37:26.510
I know you like Miss Lian.

37:26.800 --> 37:27.750
but now

37:27.920 --> 37:29.570
You don't care about the general situation.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.090
you know very well

37:31.110 --> 37:31.990
The importance of this ledger.

37:32.310 --> 37:33.590
Transport route recorded

37:33.630 --> 37:35.100
From wealthy local merchants who resell privasa salt,

37:35.140 --> 37:35.810
member list

37:35.830 --> 37:36.860
and the point of contact.

37:38.060 --> 37:38.940
we have been so long

37:38.940 --> 37:39.490
In Jinyang County,

37:39.510 --> 37:40.180
so that?

37:40.580 --> 37:41.470
Just to get the evidence as soon as possible

37:41.490 --> 37:42.910
Are you going back to Beijing to report to the court?

37:47.240 --> 37:47.910
sorry.

37:55.830 --> 37:57.140
Everything we do now is in vain.

37:58.020 --> 37:59.170
what are we going to do?

38:02.770 --> 38:04.170
Me dijo Yu Xiangjin que

38:04.870 --> 38:06.500
All persons registered on this account book

38:06.970 --> 38:08.270
They came from a local bank.

38:08.310 --> 38:09.380
It's called Jinyang Bank.

38:10.010 --> 38:10.730
¿ Banco de Jinyang?

38:11.380 --> 38:11.950
Yes.

38:13.540 --> 38:14.510
I don't have a household registration book

38:15.470 --> 38:16.550
But there is another way.

38:21.100 --> 38:22.570
I have to go back to Yingzi Village.

38:24.170 --> 38:25.080
maybe someone

38:26.340 --> 38:27.300
can help me.

38:30.410 --> 38:31.960
The boss has already said

38:31.990 --> 38:33.460
Mr. Shen is a very caring person.

38:34.150 --> 38:35.910
The boss has given him the account book.

38:36.480 --> 38:37.430
He replaced it with alcohol.

38:37.760 --> 38:38.710
He drank all the wine.

38:39.170 --> 38:40.470
What's the point of leaving a damn book behind?

38:40.750 --> 38:42.550
winter is here.

38:42.760 --> 38:44.460
So many people waiting to eat.

38:44.510 --> 38:45.120
what are we going to do?

38:47.450 --> 38:48.120
mulberry.

38:49.740 --> 38:51.060
It seems that the ledger is really useful.

38:51.480 --> 38:52.150
what is the usage?

38:56.350 --> 38:57.190
we can blackmail

38:57.200 --> 38:58.600
That young man from the Song family.

38:59.040 --> 39:00.070
The boss said so

39:00.530 --> 39:01.500
This book is written

39:01.520 --> 39:02.420
List of senders.

39:02.660 --> 39:03.920
What Shen wants

39:04.150 --> 39:05.240
The Song family also looked at him covetously.

39:05.620 --> 39:06.310
what does that mean?

39:07.110 --> 39:08.260
This shows that ledgers are very important.

39:08.480 --> 39:09.460
we can ask

39:09.480 --> 39:10.280
a lot of money.

39:10.490 --> 39:11.600
never!

39:11.630 --> 39:13.140
and temperament

39:13.160 --> 39:13.850
Of the two leaders,

39:13.870 --> 39:14.760
They won't agree.

39:14.820 --> 39:16.480
No, they cannot agree.

39:17.260 --> 39:18.370
With the temperament of the boss,

39:19.250 --> 39:20.300
I believe he cannot lose his dignity.

39:20.340 --> 39:20.930
Want money.

39:21.140 --> 39:22.380
But the ledger

39:22.420 --> 39:23.180
This doesn't work for us.

39:23.680 --> 39:24.760
Better to change it into money.

39:25.070 --> 39:26.560
when we invest money

39:26.580 --> 39:27.630
in front of them,

39:28.470 --> 39:29.540
Will they blame us?

39:30.700 --> 39:32.550
you're right. hurry up.

39:33.030 --> 39:34.730
Now I'm going to find runners.

39:34.920 --> 39:35.760
To get the word out

39:35.930 --> 39:36.940
Song Haikun found out about her.

39:37.700 --> 39:38.560
i will understand

39:38.580 --> 39:39.520
if we have left

39:39.540 --> 39:40.260
Something about that outfit.

39:40.470 --> 39:41.230
we have to dress up

39:41.250 --> 39:42.320
We can't let him identify us.

39:42.840 --> 39:44.040
We have to look for more people.

39:44.190 --> 39:45.640
Song family bodyguard

39:45.780 --> 39:46.410
They are very powerful.

39:46.580 --> 39:47.420
come on.

39:56.100 --> 39:57.020
Miss Marner.

40:01.310 --> 40:01.940
Gerente Qian.

40:02.150 --> 40:03.030
Why are you here?

40:03.620 --> 40:04.140
I'm here

40:04.270 --> 40:05.890
Asking you for the money you are owed.

40:06.710 --> 40:07.950
we have agreed

40:08.160 --> 40:11.010
You can give me more time, right?

40:11.270 --> 40:12.670
Not much time has passed yet.

40:14.160 --> 40:14.710
Apart from,

40:14.750 --> 40:16.770
Mr. Jin answered it for me.

40:17.360 --> 40:18.760
Forgive me, miss.

40:18.970 --> 40:20.610
I don't want to break my promise.

40:21.310 --> 40:22.960
Indeed, our boss

40:22.970 --> 40:24.210
He blames me.

40:24.690 --> 40:25.950
say what

40:26.070 --> 40:27.230
I borrowed more and more money.

40:27.380 --> 40:28.450
if i can't collect it

40:28.780 --> 40:30.110
I will lose

40:30.150 --> 40:31.470
Manager position.

40:32.610 --> 40:33.510
Apart from,

40:33.760 --> 40:35.720
Mr. King also borrowed money.

40:36.160 --> 40:37.960
This is never reasonable

40:37.980 --> 40:39.250
Participate in collecting payments from co-workers.

40:40.760 --> 40:41.240
Hoy

40:41.350 --> 40:42.820
I had to bring money to get the job done.

40:44.140 --> 40:45.510
When you sell wine,

40:45.630 --> 40:46.830
I will have money to pay you.

40:47.100 --> 40:49.410
If you don't have money, pay with this.

40:49.870 --> 40:50.380
work.

40:51.770 --> 40:53.210
These grapes are worthless.

40:53.240 --> 40:54.690
I got to make wine with them.

40:55.500 --> 40:56.600
Don't take them away.

40:56.620 --> 40:58.320
These grapes are indeed worthless.

40:58.340 --> 40:59.140
They are worthless.

41:00.060 --> 41:01.580
These grapes are worthless.

41:01.600 --> 41:02.160
manager,

41:02.190 --> 41:03.800
These grapes are indeed worthless.

41:05.970 --> 41:06.790
Gerente Qian.

41:07.000 --> 41:07.730
Youheng.

41:08.090 --> 41:10.020
Paying down debt is reasonable.

41:10.310 --> 41:11.320
Your father is Mr. King.

41:11.370 --> 41:12.330
I don't want to be angry with you.

41:13.070 --> 41:14.260
Don't get involved.

41:17.390 --> 41:18.040
I will refund the money

41:20.940 --> 41:21.760
for her.

41:30.650 --> 41:32.540
Wouldn't it be solved if you asked someone to return it for you?

41:32.640 --> 41:33.460
come on.

42:02.330 --> 42:02.850
Mannar.

42:04.470 --> 42:05.480
in your memory,

42:05.880 --> 42:06.840
what

42:07.080 --> 42:08.190
Does this make you happy?

42:19.850 --> 42:20.410
Comer.

42:22.050 --> 42:22.700
make money.

42:26.820 --> 42:27.620
And watch fireworks.

42:29.470 --> 42:30.270
once,

42:30.730 --> 42:32.160
I saw a lot of fireworks.

42:33.650 --> 42:34.190
so i ask

42:34.220 --> 42:35.180
a small wish

42:36.060 --> 42:36.990
I did not expect

42:37.660 --> 42:38.590
This will happen the next day.

42:42.350 --> 42:44.030
It would be great if I could see them again.

42:47.950 --> 42:48.460
forget it.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.040
There will be no fireworks here.

42:57.180 --> 43:02.680
[Task: One thousand taels of gold]

42:57.180 --> 43:02.680
[Income: Selling alcohol, borrowing money from Mr. Jin and taking out a house loan of 620 taels]

42:57.180 --> 43:02.680
[Cost: The cost of mass production of alcohol is 728 taels]
