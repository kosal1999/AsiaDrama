00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.240
Sister Hua

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.240
Sister Hua

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.320
Stop showing off your face

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.840
come home with us

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.400
I don't want your charity

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.560
Is it called charity when your family lets you go home?

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.880
Even Mai is at this time

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.160
Stop saying these high-sounding words

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.160
My parents and I

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.520
Did so many hurtful and cheap things

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.720
Talk about you in all fairness

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.040
And the whole family

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.680
you

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.840
You can really pretend that nothing has happened

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.640
?

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.040
Can you really forgive us?

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.680
We can really still be calm

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.680
Are you going to sit together again?

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.960
I never said I would forgive you

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.120
But grandpa is very worried about breaking

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.840
Although the rest of the family didn’t say anything,

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.880
But I also miss you very much in my heart

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.960
I know you won't be able to do it for a day

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.360
this home

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.320
It won't be complete

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.280
I choose to continue to make you angry

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.120
Or give each other a chance

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.680
I believe that whether it is me or other family members

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.080
Will choose the latter

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.160
so go home

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.080
Even if it's just

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.440
Have a New Year's Eve dinner

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.640
this is me

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.240
It is also the wish of the whole family

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.400
small 7

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.560
Come and take it and share it with everyone

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.240
I'm here. I'm here. Oh, it's great.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.920
Come and give it to your sister.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.360
Let’s divide these first. Your father still writes them?

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.760
Come to Xiaoqi

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.400
Boss lady eh

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.320
Wow, these shoes are so pretty

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.080
Home page

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.560
Come and see

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.960
How about the word laosan?

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.360
Oh, Xiang is so lazy

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.760
good looking good looking

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.280
It’s Chinese New Year. It’s Chinese New Year.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.680
Big brother, big brother

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.440
Second brother, sister, sister-in-law, you are back, you are back

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.840
Happy New Year, happy New Year, happy New Year, happy New Year

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.160
Slow down for the New Year

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.760
New Year's Eve when I was a kid

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.800
My eldest brother likes to buy paper flowers and bring them to me.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.240
I didn't expect him to remember

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.200
Mom went to town to buy a pair of shoes for your uncle.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.560
Look how pitiful he looks like that

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.920
Grandpa, grandpa

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.600
This writing is really good, really good

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.520
Happy Chinese New Year. I'll come back.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.080
Just come back

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.600
adhesive clothing

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.320
oops

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.160
Hahaha my good

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.040
Hahaha

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:15.920
perhaps

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.240
This is home, right?

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.440
There is sadness

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.200
Good or bad

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.480
meaning of family

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.960
It is to make people in this world

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.160
no longer lonely

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.320
I'm coming

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.480
The food is here. The food is here. Oh, it’s all here so quickly.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.400
So fragrant

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.680
Sister-in-law did it here

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.400
My skills are not good either

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.600
Everyone, give it a try

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.480
It’s delicious, hahaha

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.240
This, this, this

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.600
I never thought I would be able to eat grass one day

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.280
He's hungry

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.320
Hahahaha okay

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.480
Then

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.720
That's fine. Don't do it even after you say it.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.960
Also, it is really inconvenient to pay for rent.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.080
We'll dismantle it when the police are old enough.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.520
Hahaha

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.480
ha

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.800
Xiao Guo, this is for me, what else?

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.880
I know you spend the most ambiguous time, I guess

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.600
Remember to clean up after yourself, okay, it's okay

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.000
Lady

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.800
Eat vegetables

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.400
Yan'er

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.320
That piece of paper of yours

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.520
How's it going?

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.680
I don’t know how good it is that I’ve simply lost weight.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.520
What's wrong

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.800
It's okay. I'll give you a surprise later.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:47.960
Come hahaha

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.760
Well, you are here, you are now 30

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.800
Let me say a few words.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.120
not easy

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:04.360
It’s rare that our family can sit together again

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.240
Have a reunion dinner

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.680
I feel indescribably happy in my heart

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.800
in the past period

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.440
We made many appointments cheaply

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.440
Each of you

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.120
I also suffered a lot

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.160
Oops, ok

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.440
What are you talking about on New Year's Eve?

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.840
No, I mean tell the children, tell us

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.040
No matter what happened in the past

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.120
All of us are safe and sound

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.000
bustling

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.720
Haha, be safe

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.960
Qiqi is growing up hahaha oops

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.640
My mother

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.840
Really good at talking hahaha

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.400
That girl

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.320
I'll toast you

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.120
How can the elders respect the younger ones?

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.120
I respect you and can’t say that.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.400
without you

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.040
I guess in my whole life

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.320
I won’t get together with everyone anymore

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.920
This cup should be served to my sister-in-law

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.240
Ouch, what the hell?

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.840
Hahaha

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.320
Your brandy is more bitter than yellow face, hahaha

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.280
Sister, how about you make wine with my mother after the new year?

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.800
Seriously, seriously, what you said, haha, let me teach you

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.040
Good hahaha

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.520
I mean sister-in-law

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.560
I toast you this cup

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.200
Uh I shouldn't

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.000
Not when you came to us

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.800
Said so many cruel words to you

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:34.920
sorry

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.520
It was really our fault first.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.800
My sister-in-law also feels guilty

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.320
Then let's drink this cup together

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.120
Put it away after drinking

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.400
What should be forgotten?

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.400
Come

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.440
Talk about me again

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.680
Give me a chance

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.800
give me a chance

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.120
you say

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.920
Why do you want to say something about our cheap New Year’s Eve dinner?

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.760
Dear elders

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.920
Taking advantage of the fact that today is New Year’s Eve

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.520
I would like to ask all the elders to bear witness

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.720
I think

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.880
Officially propose marriage to a cheap person

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.200
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.560
What's the matter?

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.360
I have opened my mouth. This is 13. This is

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.720
Uh-huh, that 13

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.480
Although you and Ye'er are in love with each other.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:49.000
But this important matter of marriage is three coins and six betrothals.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.240
The rules must not be bad

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:50.760
Right, right, right

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.680
I agree, uh, I came in a hurry this time.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.480
Uh, I haven't prepared the betrothal gift yet, but

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.800
I have all these things with me

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.640
Here is my metric waist tag

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.360
And my house equipment and ground atmosphere in Yingjiang

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.320
Someone asks for marriage

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.280
They all give money and gifts

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.080
I want everything about me

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.480
Leave it all to Ye'er

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.240
Wow haha

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.360
ha

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.640
Hello

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.720
I will definitely let Ye'er live a stable life

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:27.440
Well, I plan to take her back to my hometown after the new year.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.480
meet parents

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.560
I also let everyone in my family know that I am married.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.640
Such a nice girl

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.080
This betrothal gift is secondary.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.480
The important thing is to ask us what we mean by one or two.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.400
Haha, right, right

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.160
One or two

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.320
would you like

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.440
Yeah, I'm willing to agree. I agree.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.200
He agreed hahaha, who do you want?

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.720
Hahaha

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.560
Hahaha, eat vegetables, eat vegetables, hahaha

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.520
You must be nice to Yan

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.760
I can't spare our uncle

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.960
Don't worry, second uncle

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.360
What are you doing to others?

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.560
You have to talk to people properly.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.160
Call me uncle

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.080
Yes, yes, dad

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:37.400
Mother, good, good, good, good

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:39.840
well

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.040
good

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.360
Hahaha let’s toast everyone together

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.080
Come on, come on, come on, come on

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.840
It's snowing

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.640
It's snowing. It's snowing. Oops.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.920
It's really snowing. It's really snowing. It's really nice.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.280
Oh, good, so good

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.360
Oh, Lian family has a happy new year

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.400
Auspicious snow and good harvest

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.720
Auspicious snow and good harvest

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.640
Auspicious snow and good harvest

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.280
Congratulations on getting rich hahaha

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.280
Hahaha

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.160

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:31.320
Kneel down and wear Yuanbao to enjoy the sunset and enjoy the mood and automatically

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.320
sometimes get

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.240
galloping dragon

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.000
color

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.520
grateful

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.840
among old people

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.640
little woman

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.320
Who weaves love into the snow

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.840
brew spring wine

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.080
I wish there were two people in one house

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.640
Three meals and four seasons

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.120
Wish to be as light as autumn water

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.480
Silence and compassion

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.040
May this life be your companion

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.200
Hey Ma, what did you write?

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.360
not tell you

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.600
You write a word and put a lamp, and yet you are so mysterious?

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.320
Come

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.760
One, two, three, go

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.680
Browsing through the sea of ​​people

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.480
No longer

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:13.920
exist

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:15.720
I am leaving

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:36.560
Hahahahahahahahaha come on

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.200
Happy New Year, Grandpa and Sister-in-law. Happy New Year.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.960
Everything is fine. Sit down.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:48.120
Oh, another year, oh, oh, oh!

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.280
Such a great gift

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.320
Get the red envelope for the Happy New Year

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.880
Hahaha, grandpa has already prepared it for you.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.960
11 years ago

00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.960
Come on, thank you grandpa

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:04.320
Hahahaha thank you so much grandma

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.840
Well, the one who raised me

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:09.480
Ouch, hahaha, just one, oh, really

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.800
Thank you, sister-in-law

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:20.440
Then I wish my grandparents and my aunts a happy new year.

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.720
Come and next year, all your wishes will come true

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:24.960
Safe and healthy

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.680
May all go well with you

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:32.280
I also wish us ladies all the best.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.360
Yeah hahaha

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.880
You really have to leave the restaurant to us

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.600
The second uncle was originally in charge of accounts in the restaurant.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.640
The second aunt is also familiar with those chefs and regular customers.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.440
It's best to leave the restaurant to you two.

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.120
You left it to us

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.640
Then what are you going to do?

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.400
I have other things to go

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.960
Are you thinking about making money again?

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.680
A new business is about to start

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.400
You said this thing of ours is just a brain?

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.800
A steady stream of business would be smart, huh?

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.680
Before I hand over the restaurant to you, I have one more thing to ask of you.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.520
Just speak up

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.800
Did I say that I would climb mountains of swords and descend into seas of fire?

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.160
Just one word from you

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:32.200
Well, our restaurant is getting bigger and bigger now.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.040
There is also a bit of a shortage of manpower.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.320
I wonder if I can spend it as a couple

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.080
I also called the restaurant to help.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:43.000
I will give you this experience just like I gave it to you before.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.440
Of course that's good

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.440
Don’t worry, this matter will be taken care of by the second uncle, haha

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.480
Thank you, uncle

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:53.040
Thank you, Second Auntie, for visiting this kid again after class.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.480
Throw it down

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.560
Hahahahahahaha oops

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.960
Mom, it's too cold. Go back quickly.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.120
We are all here

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.440
Okay, send it here

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.760
Remember to write a letter back when you arrive in Yingjiang

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.240
Take good care of yourself

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.960
Don't worry, I will

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.080
Don't just focus on the restaurant business, either.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.160
You must take good care of your body

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.600
I’ll leave it to you, Sister Ye’er.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.880
I will definitely take good care of her

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.120
I won't let her say that she will be wronged later.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.600
Okay

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.280
I'm only going away for a few months and will be back soon

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.080
When the time comes, I will make a lot of beautiful rouges

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.000
I'll give them all to you.

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:47.120
Um

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.080
Don't wait for me to come back

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.200
Um

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.320
I will definitely wait for you to come back

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:57.200
Let's go

00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:58.600
Let's go

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.760
Be careful hehe

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.040
Then let's go

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.800
Be careful on the road

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.640
How many times have I told you

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.080
pout

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:51.720
Look ahead Look ahead

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:53.680
Uncle Jin

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.880
Didn’t you already agree to be transected to study medicine?

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:56.840
How do you pay back

00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.320
stop

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.080
What are you standing for?

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:05.240
Hahaha, old Uncle Jin, hey, here he comes, this is

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.440
This is my distant nephew

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.280
I'm teaching him self-defense techniques

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:10.400
how

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.520
Hahaha, you really have a bit of style, haha

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.360
Much smarter than temptation

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.800
You're bored, why are you here?

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.560
I'm here to deliver a letter

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:25.560
Come

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.840
Look forward and don't panic.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.160
do you know come

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.320
Look ahead and take it

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.640
There are wise men, so don’t panic.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:39.760
Minsu

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.120
Dr. Hu from Tai Hospital

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.480
Ouch, his handwritten letter

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.280
Shen Nuo married you to Hu Yuyi

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.160
He has agreed to take you on as his disciple

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.560
In the future, you can study medicine with famous teachers

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.360
I will definitely be admitted to Tai Hospital soon.

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.760
Hahaha

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.440
I just said that we, Lao Wang, don’t have men.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:03.600
No, come and have a look

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.360
Oh thank you

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.120
Thank you also Shen Nuo

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.600
I ward off evil spirits

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.600
After you get married

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.080
Take care

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.360
May your heart desire

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:24.440
bright future

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.600
OMG

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.840
I haven't left yet. Why did I say it as if I wanted to say goodbye?

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.240
Haha, will you say this sooner or later?

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.000
This is what you said about saying goodbye.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.960
Hurry up and buy some elbows

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:41.560
clear clearly

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:42.360
I'm happy today

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.800
I won’t eat here after that.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.680
I have something to do at home. I have to go back. You can eat by yourself.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.360
No, I'm leaving first, Mom

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:56.800
Okay, you, hahaha, are much better than your father.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.480
Niu Fu’s most powerful meaning is dad

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:03.160
You are so good, hahaha. Your father is much better.

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.320
Really promising

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:07.920
Hahaha, let me see what you are reading. You are illiterate.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.760
Dad, we need to have a drink tonight.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.280
Brother Heng

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:19.960
Bye now

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.280
receive

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.480
Come on, let’s write 2

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.320
Our little 7

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.440
In the next year, I can go to the dead rat in town to study.

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:53.000
The teacher is a very knowledgeable gentleman.

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.920
Xiao Qi will surely learn from him if he follows him

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.800
That's great, sister, I can have sex with my fourth uncle.

00:24:58.800 --> 00:24:59.920
please don't be happy

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.920
I need to practice this word well before meeting my husband.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.480
Well, practice hard

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.760
Hahaha

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:12.280
only

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:16.120
One is for a restaurant and the other is for a new residence.

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.120
I bought you a new house

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.480
Then you can just go and live there

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.320
Restaurant monthly profit

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.200
The second uncle will give it to you on a monthly basis

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.560
Ensure parents have a worry-free life

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:32.240
Wang'er, what are you doing if you don't cook?

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:36.920
I'm going to open a bigger restaurant

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.200
So I gave this small restaurant to my parents.

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.280
Hahahahaha boo

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.600
Keep your voice down

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.200
Sister

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:49.120
My parents still have the energy to make money.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.120
Don't make yourself miserable

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:53.960
How angry is this?

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.440
Mom will help you keep it first

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:59.000
When you need money, just tell your mother, you know?

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.760
Yeah. I know

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:08.000
Come and grab some foam

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:14.520
Keep it

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.040
Hey 15

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.080
What is this word?

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.000
What is the word 2?

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:31.160
Ding ding hahaha

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.080
Wait until the next year

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.480
Xiao Qi will be able to learn many, many words after going to private school.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.520
Are you happy hahaha?

00:26:59.000 --> 00:26:59.800
mom

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.600
Ha ha

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.120
I want to give you a new quilt

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:08.720
Let's try it and see if it feels comfortable when covered with it.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.960
They are all made of new cotton.

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.000
If you feel comfortable covering it?

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.800
Mom will make you two new beds.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.040
How is it so soft?

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.560
OK

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.880
It's good for you to be covered up and comfortable, mother.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.560
You sleep with me tonight

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.920
How old is the child?

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.680
No matter how old she is, she is still her mother’s daughter.

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.400
Hahaha good

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:41.840
Mom will sleep with you now

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.040
Yeah hahaha come on

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.040
oops

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:47.760
Come

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.280
Oh, in the blink of an eye

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.160
My sister has grown so big

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.680
It's time to get married.

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:04.320
Mom, well, will you miss me when I'm gone?

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.400
Of course mom misses you

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.600
Mom doesn’t want to let you go either

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:12.960
but

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:16.040
As long as you live in peace and harmony

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.520
happily

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.400
Mom is content, okay?

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.720
Mother, please sing a song for me

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:27.520
good

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.000
The wolf is coming

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.160
coming

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:46.200
Something happened to my sister

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.040
Go to the fields and have a look

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.080
What's the matter?

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:52.360
You'll know once you go there. Hey, slow down.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.720
Oh, hurry up, hurry up, slow down

00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.440
You'll know what you're doing there

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.960
Sister, hurry up!

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.920
Don’t say it. Slow down.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.680
This is nothing

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.320
You lied to my sister again. Look

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.640
You, me, you

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:53.160
Miss Mai Er

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.800
Did you wake up, Miss Mai Er?

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.160
Miss Ma'er

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:07.880
Miss Ma'er

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.720
There's nothing uncomfortable about it, right?

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.320
No congratulations on successfully completing all missions

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.320
Are you OK

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:33.840
Just feel

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:38.840
had a dream

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.400
This is a cheap courtyard

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:56.960
This circle is Dahuang’s range of action

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.120
And some other people's lines of action

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.760
You can view it here

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.680
You said it was like a dream

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:07.440
This is the wonderful thing about our game

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.040
Give you 360 degrees

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.360
All directions without blind spots

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.480
Immersive experience of the game world

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.400
So everything we go through

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.040
It's all designed

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:23.120
It’s not, uh, after the task is triggered.

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:25.560
All your actions are under your subjective control

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:28.120
But the main mission and the clearance ending

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:29.560
It's all set

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.360
Ending of the game

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.560
Just make enough to earn 1,000 pounds.

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.800
You also completed a hidden mission

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.880
Just defeated the biggest boss Wu Zhonglian

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.720
Let the villagers return to the village

00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:47.880
Then the people we meet are actually MPCs

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:54.160
Is it a game? One true and one false is your experience.

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.720
I need you to fill this in, please.

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.440
Uh, what else?

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.200
We will be there within 7 working days

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.920
Send you your game winnings OK

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:07.800
Then fill it out first

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.320
13Tell me before you leave

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.680
He is going back to his hometown of Yingjiang with Sister Yi'er

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.120
I also want to drink the peach blossom juice made by Sister Yi'er

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.720
That's where they sell milk, cream, etc.

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:28.160
Are you still angry with Sister Yi'er?

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.000
Is this guy not planning to be reinstated?

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.480
Hey, I'm so lucky to have a sister

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.240
how about you

00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:58.520
When are you leaving?

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.240
celebrate festivals

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.400
That's pretty fast

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.400
In a few days

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:10.840
There was a shooting in Liaoyang County

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.280
How about I take you there

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:20.720
what do you mean

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:28.320
mom

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:30.640
I want to be with you all the time

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:33.920
I want to accompany you in spring plowing and autumn harvest

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:37.320
Accompany you to do whatever you want to do

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.360
Maybe there will be many twists and turns in the future.

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.560
I can't promise you stability for the rest of your life

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:47.640
But I will never give up

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.160
Never be separated from you again

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.360
Look at what my little pony has become.

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:03.640
I'd better do it

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.680
Let me take a look first

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.520
Then you have to work harder in the future

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:15.320
My family doesn’t support idlers

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:19.560
Don't forget that I am now a man with a fenglu

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:24.280
Then can you give me more of your money?

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:26.640
Not willing anymore

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:29.680
please me he asks you

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:31.080
Well, I don't want to

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:35.960
Everyone listens to you, but who cares about you?

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.600
deciduous flowers
