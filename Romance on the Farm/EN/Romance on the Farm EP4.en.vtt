01:54.680 --> 01:55.280
Second aunt

01:57.120 --> 01:57.840
Second aunt

01:59.030 --> 02:00.840
Second aunt, second aunt

02:01.200 --> 02:02.160
Second aunt

02:06.000 --> 02:06.560
Eat chicken

02:08.240 --> 02:08.720
Where is she?

02:09.120 --> 02:10.000
Where?

02:10.600 --> 02:11.160
Second aunt

02:11.400 --> 02:12.560
Grandpa wants to borrow money

02:12.560 --> 02:13.280
Why don't you take a look?

02:14.960 --> 02:16.280
What's there to see?

02:16.680 --> 02:18.360
The money borrowed was not for me.

02:19.880 --> 02:21.720
Second aunt, listen to me

02:22.560 --> 02:23.400
Yesterday I agreed

02:23.440 --> 02:24.560
After borrowing money from Uncle Jin,

02:25.400 --> 02:26.800
I tossed and turned all night

02:27.120 --> 02:27.800
I will think about it

02:28.160 --> 02:30.000
If Lian Huaier marries into the Song family,

02:30.440 --> 02:31.680
Are they the Song family?

02:32.120 --> 02:33.070
certainly

02:33.440 --> 02:35.560
But on this IOU

02:35.880 --> 02:37.400
This is my handprint

02:39.560 --> 02:40.280
The Song family borrowed money

02:41.070 --> 02:41.840
Even family members left their fingerprints

02:42.720 --> 02:43.960
Second aunt, are you comfortable?

02:44.400 --> 02:45.000
even on the ground

02:47.000 --> 02:48.440
He still feels uncomfortable

02:49.240 --> 02:50.960
No, what do you mean?

02:51.280 --> 02:52.000
I mean

02:53.160 --> 02:54.000
Just this IOU

02:54.160 --> 02:55.360
They are the fingerprints we leave on our families

02:56.400 --> 02:57.120
If later

02:57.280 --> 02:58.680
Hua'er said she was from the Song family

02:59.120 --> 02:59.600
Why

02:59.600 --> 03:00.960
pay us and our families

03:01.280 --> 03:02.840
Do we have to get our money back?

03:05.280 --> 03:06.680
If Uncle Jane wants to collect the bill

03:07.080 --> 03:09.000
Our room is here too

03:09.160 --> 03:09.960
The land is here too

03:10.120 --> 03:12.080
You can't even escape.

03:14.680 --> 03:15.280
an old man

03:15.800 --> 03:17.160
Find out if there is a problem

03:17.360 --> 03:18.440
Just sign and commit

03:18.840 --> 03:20.280
Then the world married me

03:20.520 --> 03:21.070
exchange money

03:21.680 --> 03:22.560
no problem

03:23.000 --> 03:23.800
What kind of person are you?

03:24.120 --> 03:25.160
my father knows

03:26.070 --> 03:26.560
Then it

03:30.720 --> 03:31.840
I'll mention my grandfather in a moment

03:32.280 --> 03:33.240
Would you assist me?

03:34.360 --> 03:35.280
I'm still waiting for you

03:43.560 --> 03:44.070
I'm waiting

03:46.360 --> 03:46.840
dad

03:47.400 --> 03:48.560
The handprint of this IOU

03:49.120 --> 03:50.280
Flowers must be pressed tightly

03:53.400 --> 03:54.120
this flower

03:54.400 --> 03:56.120
She is still a girl who has not yet left the courtroom.

03:56.440 --> 03:58.000
Where can I do something like this?

03:58.160 --> 03:59.840
Father should have pressed the button

04:00.280 --> 04:02.080
The father is the head of the family, right?

04:02.720 --> 04:04.800
Although this is true

04:05.240 --> 04:06.120
But what about words?

04:06.280 --> 04:07.520
But you can't say that

04:08.280 --> 04:10.160
Sister-in-law, that’s all

04:10.280 --> 04:11.560
Everything is in good condition

04:12.240 --> 04:14.400
Although Hua'er's words sound nice

04:14.840 --> 04:16.600
But if you can’t get the money in the future

04:17.480 --> 04:18.040
This must be taken

04:18.040 --> 04:20.240
Even the land and house at home are worth it.

04:20.480 --> 04:21.360
then we

04:21.360 --> 04:23.040
But how do we live?

04:23.240 --> 04:24.040
How do you live?

04:25.600 --> 04:27.680
This chief protects children

04:28.040 --> 04:29.480
Although this is human nature

04:30.040 --> 04:30.800
Shan Lian's family

04:31.040 --> 04:32.920
Hua'er is not just a daughter

04:33.480 --> 04:35.120
I also have Ye'er and Ji Zu.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.600
Where is our half-brother?

04:38.040 --> 04:39.040
It's even a flower

04:39.150 --> 04:40.600
She is just a daughter after all

04:40.920 --> 04:42.360
Our grandfather is a grandson

04:43.240 --> 04:44.840
From now on we will have to rely on these family assets.

04:44.920 --> 04:46.150
Study and marry

04:46.840 --> 04:47.720
Today’s footprints

04:48.150 --> 04:49.040
Flowers must be pressed tightly

04:53.000 --> 04:53.800
Second aunt

04:54.680 --> 04:56.360
This money was lent to me

04:56.920 --> 04:58.800
I will definitely pay

04:59.680 --> 05:00.840
Okay, okay, push it again, push it again

05:00.840 --> 05:01.360
Come and click on it

05:01.920 --> 05:02.480
Ryan Manner

05:03.920 --> 05:04.840
There are elders here

05:05.480 --> 05:06.600
Is it your turn to interrupt?

05:08.120 --> 05:08.480
third child

05:08.840 --> 05:09.800
You still don’t discipline me

05:09.800 --> 05:10.600
your inspiration

05:11.400 --> 05:12.920
More and more disrespectful

05:15.720 --> 05:16.280
Manier

05:17.400 --> 05:19.160
Let your father decide

05:20.840 --> 05:21.920
our flowers

05:22.240 --> 05:23.800
I certainly won't default on my debt.

05:24.360 --> 05:25.000
besides it

05:25.360 --> 05:27.800
So where is the old man now?

05:28.280 --> 05:29.360
Let the granddaughter come forward

05:29.360 --> 05:30.480
He is the one who makes the decision to borrow money.

05:30.920 --> 05:31.720
If this thing spreads

05:31.800 --> 05:32.840
let strangers know

05:33.480 --> 05:34.040
after that

05:34.360 --> 05:35.920
How come you miss our family?

05:36.150 --> 05:37.680
Uncle Jin is not a talkative person.

05:38.040 --> 05:39.120
Don't even tell your family

05:39.280 --> 05:40.000
who knows

05:40.150 --> 05:41.040
How dare you say so much?

05:43.150 --> 05:45.040
This young master of the Lian family is extremely powerful.

05:46.400 --> 05:47.800
It seems that even the head of the family cannot communicate

05:48.720 --> 05:49.720
He is your eldest son

05:52.040 --> 05:53.240
I'm not dead yet

05:53.800 --> 05:54.280
dad

05:55.040 --> 05:56.480
That was not what I meant

06:03.680 --> 06:04.160
dad

06:05.480 --> 06:06.240
or

06:06.800 --> 06:08.160
Let's discuss it some more

06:09.920 --> 06:10.680
Xiucai Xianggong

06:11.120 --> 06:12.720
We made an agreement before

06:13.120 --> 06:14.800
I said let me write this thank you letter

06:14.800 --> 06:15.360
brought here

06:15.680 --> 06:16.720
now look at this

06:16.920 --> 06:17.560
look at your family

06:17.560 --> 06:18.480
He also said we would discuss it later

06:19.720 --> 06:20.400
I, Lao Jin, am not

06:20.400 --> 06:21.280
Everything you say is nonsense

06:21.720 --> 06:23.160
People who borrow money from our bank

06:23.360 --> 06:25.160
You can queue from the village head to the city head

06:25.720 --> 06:26.600
five hundred taels of silver

06:27.280 --> 06:28.800
There is a lot of gold every day

06:29.240 --> 06:30.600
Do you want to be insincere?

06:31.120 --> 06:31.920
Don't block my money path either

06:35.240 --> 06:36.600
dad

06:44.720 --> 06:45.280
I press

07:23.720 --> 07:25.600
The problem of forced marriage was finally solved

07:26.240 --> 07:27.800
No one should bother me anymore

07:28.160 --> 07:28.600
correct

07:31.400 --> 07:33.360
You should think fast to make money

07:33.720 --> 07:35.560
Although this place is beautiful, I can't stay here for long.

07:36.480 --> 07:37.000
rhubarb

07:37.240 --> 07:37.800
You feel

07:38.000 --> 07:38.920
Can I earn a thousand gold coins?

07:40.000 --> 07:40.360
capable

07:41.150 --> 07:41.720
able

07:42.800 --> 07:44.400
I feel relieved after listening to your words

07:50.920 --> 07:51.240
he goes

08:16.240 --> 08:17.240
I know

08:17.720 --> 08:18.480
Make money selling Pyracantha

08:18.600 --> 08:19.600
very slow

08:20.160 --> 08:21.600
But this is only a temporary measure

08:22.160 --> 08:23.040
I investigated

08:23.560 --> 08:25.280
What lipstick and red makes a pig wet?

08:25.600 --> 08:26.600
Everyone is selling

08:27.200 --> 08:28.360
Let you work hard

08:28.480 --> 08:29.600
Too big, too qualified

08:33.320 --> 08:33.880
so

08:34.720 --> 08:35.840
Go write a letter to yourself

08:36.240 --> 08:37.520
Writing a letter suits you

08:38.000 --> 08:39.080
Also, you’re missing out on the market

08:39.120 --> 08:40.120
don’t worry.

08:44.600 --> 08:47.240
Why not reject it quickly?

08:47.600 --> 08:48.360
I have considered

08:48.600 --> 08:49.960
This business does not require funds

08:50.120 --> 08:51.240
no technical content

08:51.840 --> 08:52.360
you

08:52.840 --> 08:54.000
just sit there

08:54.480 --> 08:55.600
With your handsome face

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
This girl can't catch up

08:57.000 --> 08:57.840
Will I spend money on you?

09:01.360 --> 09:02.240
I'm not talking about you

09:02.320 --> 09:03.120
What does beautiful face mean?

09:03.720 --> 09:04.480
I mean

09:04.880 --> 09:05.840
This god gave me food

09:06.000 --> 09:06.880
feed into mouth

09:07.120 --> 09:08.840
It would be rude if you don't eat again

09:10.440 --> 09:11.320
besides it

09:11.480 --> 09:13.000
You still owe me one hundred taels

09:13.480 --> 09:15.480
Paying off debt is normal

09:22.480 --> 09:23.440
In addition to writing letters

09:24.200 --> 09:25.000
Everything else can be considered

09:29.840 --> 09:31.840
Okay, then you can tell me

09:32.240 --> 09:32.760
what can you do?

09:33.480 --> 09:34.480
My heart doesn't want to move

09:35.000 --> 09:35.760
Face reluctant to sell

09:36.360 --> 09:37.480
Pick a piece of Pyracantha and grind it up.

09:37.600 --> 09:38.520
Xiaoqi is more capable than you

09:39.880 --> 09:40.600
Sunset

09:41.440 --> 09:42.240
Not satisfied with this basket

09:42.600 --> 09:43.120
Don't come back

09:57.440 --> 09:57.880
Xiao Qi

10:02.840 --> 10:03.760
strangeness

10:04.000 --> 10:05.480
Brother Shen Nuo is cool

10:08.880 --> 10:10.720
It's filling up quickly, so let's go.

10:11.120 --> 10:11.720
We go home

10:18.120 --> 10:25.840
good

10:26.400 --> 10:28.360
Like this

10:28.480 --> 10:37.000
Recurring thoughts and common dreams in daily life

10:37.240 --> 10:43.120
Could it have been arranged five hundred years ago?

10:43.760 --> 10:51.240
This body must belong to him

10:56.840 --> 10:59.000
Someone calls the door

10:59.840 --> 11:01.240
Listen to audio

11:01.600 --> 11:03.440
she is female

11:03.720 --> 11:06.840
Turns out he's not a thief

11:07.240 --> 11:11.240
Wait for me to open the door

11:12.480 --> 11:13.360
OK

11:13.520 --> 11:15.080
All right

11:15.600 --> 11:19.760
good

11:20.480 --> 11:22.200
Like this

11:22.360 --> 11:30.360
Recurring thoughts and common dreams in daily life

11:30.360 --> 11:30.840
Thirteen

11:32.120 --> 11:32.600
Thirteen

11:33.640 --> 11:35.080
Go in, grab your stuff, then get out quickly

12:13.600 --> 12:14.120
Thirteen

12:14.600 --> 12:15.120
Lang Jun

12:15.240 --> 12:15.600
you

12:19.880 --> 12:20.360
Lang Jun

12:22.720 --> 12:23.720
Why are you dressed like this?

12:24.360 --> 12:25.760
I'm getting ready to perform on stage

12:26.600 --> 12:27.120
monitor

12:27.520 --> 12:28.200
you are not restricted

12:28.200 --> 12:29.000
Are you in danger?

12:29.120 --> 12:29.880
i am tied

12:29.960 --> 12:30.880
i am tied

12:31.240 --> 12:32.360
Tonight's band

12:32.440 --> 12:33.520
He grabbed me on stage to make up the numbers.

12:37.240 --> 12:37.880
That band is in the basement

12:38.000 --> 12:39.080
Do you know where it comes from?

12:40.520 --> 12:41.360
On the surface they are

12:41.840 --> 12:42.840
They are the people who walk in the villages and alleys.

12:42.840 --> 12:43.320
road technician

12:44.360 --> 12:46.240
But his skills are really impressive

12:46.840 --> 12:48.240
After I promised to meet you that day

12:48.360 --> 12:49.240
I got here first

12:49.720 --> 12:50.760
I happened to meet them as an occupier

12:50.840 --> 12:51.640
This is a big car shop

12:52.000 --> 12:53.360
It has been converted into a temporary building

12:54.200 --> 12:55.200
Waiting for you to come

12:55.360 --> 12:56.320
I'm attracted to this band leader.

12:56.360 --> 12:57.240
detained without reason

12:58.000 --> 12:59.120
So why did it take so long to arrive?

13:01.360 --> 13:02.360
I was hit by a poisonous arrow

13:02.840 --> 13:04.080
He also allowed officials to see his face

13:04.480 --> 13:05.240
They were sending additional manpower

13:05.440 --> 13:06.360
Look for me everywhere

13:06.720 --> 13:07.480
I can only temporarily

13:07.840 --> 13:09.000
Live in a farmer's house

13:09.120 --> 13:10.200
Are you safe there?

13:10.720 --> 13:11.360
All right

13:11.520 --> 13:12.880
Don't worry, it's no big deal

13:13.480 --> 13:14.640
I made a deal with that family

13:15.760 --> 13:16.120
Now

13:16.200 --> 13:17.360
He is their distant nephew

13:17.960 --> 13:19.080
Do odd jobs for them on weekdays

13:19.360 --> 13:20.200
Even if someone investigates

13:20.600 --> 13:21.200
that family

13:21.440 --> 13:22.480
It will also help me cover

13:23.440 --> 13:24.640
Last time I came to see you

13:25.240 --> 13:25.840
meet your guard

13:25.840 --> 13:26.840
They are all practitioners

13:27.760 --> 13:28.720
The injuries on my body at that time

13:28.760 --> 13:29.480
he has not recovered yet

13:30.000 --> 13:31.120
I can only leave now

13:31.960 --> 13:32.960
But with your skills

13:33.360 --> 13:34.440
Why not find an opportunity to escape?

13:35.480 --> 13:36.480
because i found

13:44.240 --> 13:45.840
How great is brotherly love

13:45.840 --> 13:47.360
Plot synopsis of Never Leaving · · · · · ·

13:50.440 --> 13:53.720
This man is handsome

13:54.640 --> 13:55.320
not quality

13:55.960 --> 13:57.520
Just stay with us at Shengde.

14:10.200 --> 14:12.120
The world's No. 1 please take the dental floss whip

14:17.120 --> 14:18.480
Then it depends on whether you can keep it.

14:19.120 --> 14:19.600
the best

14:32.600 --> 14:36.200
This king will not recruit a spouse

14:54.000 --> 15:07.000
All right

15:07.120 --> 15:09.120
Please Nianzi give us a chain pestle (please give money to the audience to stop)

15:09.760 --> 15:13.320
All right

15:41.520 --> 15:42.120
It's him

15:42.360 --> 15:43.360
I've seen this villain with my own eyes

15:43.360 --> 15:44.360
Kill Mr. Sun

15:50.240 --> 15:53.520
OK

15:57.200 --> 16:01.000
OK

16:09.360 --> 16:11.240
Don't run, I haven't paid you yet

16:11.720 --> 16:12.320
give me money

16:15.360 --> 16:16.120
give me money

16:31.480 --> 16:32.880
If you want someone, just say so.

16:33.600 --> 16:35.120
Why play the "hard to get" game?

16:35.480 --> 16:37.120
Dealing with your boss is very difficult.

16:38.120 --> 16:39.880
The note stabbed Qing Ziqing (cut with gun and knife)

16:40.480 --> 16:41.840
For me, doing anything is an illusion (for me running away is an illusion).

16:45.760 --> 16:47.000
The palace is full of spring (full of slander)

16:47.720 --> 16:49.120
Can he become a carefree person? (Could he be a liar?)

16:49.360 --> 16:50.600
Just a friend in Chinese characters (Just a friend on the road)

16:51.840 --> 16:52.720
Since we met (Since we met)

16:54.120 --> 16:55.000
Why don't you give me a threshold (Why don't you give me your name)

16:55.000 --> 16:56.240
It took me two days to pack up the pestle (the troupe came to perform here)

16:56.240 --> 16:57.320
Start a business (do something bad)

16:57.760 --> 16:59.000
I have ten thousand tiger heads (I am the king)

16:59.320 --> 17:01.040
It’s just that the last name is Yu

17:02.200 --> 17:03.800
look at your appearance

17:04.000 --> 17:05.680
Even if you don't want to, you are still a person on the road

17:08.520 --> 17:09.310
my brother

17:09.720 --> 17:11.000
Since being arrested by Commander Yu,

17:11.920 --> 17:13.000
He must have offended the monitor

17:15.280 --> 17:16.280
I apologize first.

17:17.880 --> 17:18.960
Do I dare to ask the squad leader to detain someone?

17:19.400 --> 17:20.040
Why

17:25.310 --> 17:27.240
Your brother doesn't know the rules

17:27.720 --> 17:28.920
I sit on my bag

17:29.960 --> 17:31.080
masculinity

17:31.440 --> 17:32.760
Household items intended for human consumption

17:33.400 --> 17:34.400
good luck

17:35.720 --> 17:36.480
actually

17:38.000 --> 17:39.080
Team Leader Yu, you'd better tell me your number

17:39.920 --> 17:41.640
Give me a chance to make friends

17:42.280 --> 17:43.160
You and I both know

17:43.680 --> 17:44.720
Do you want my brother to go?

17:44.720 --> 17:46.200
It's just a matter of your words

17:46.720 --> 17:47.200
OK

17:49.280 --> 17:50.720
lose tonight's show

17:51.000 --> 17:52.560
Plus the fact that your brother abused me

17:53.560 --> 17:54.280
Two hundred taels

17:54.720 --> 17:55.880
Lion, open your mouth

17:56.000 --> 17:57.520
Isn't this against traffic rules?

17:57.720 --> 17:58.440
shut up

17:59.040 --> 17:59.760
a base

18:00.320 --> 18:01.440
I am the rule

18:03.640 --> 18:04.280
Two hundred taels

18:09.000 --> 18:10.520
This is so embarrassing.

18:11.320 --> 18:12.080
seems just

18:12.440 --> 18:13.800
leave my brother here

18:14.680 --> 18:15.200
bid farewell

18:16.480 --> 18:17.160
One hundred taels

18:20.240 --> 18:21.240
fifty taels

18:25.520 --> 18:26.640
Two hundred taels is two hundred taels

18:27.000 --> 18:27.720
within a month

18:28.080 --> 18:29.240
I will pay enough to redeem people

18:30.920 --> 18:32.200
How dare you harass me?

18:34.480 --> 18:36.000
Boss Yu, don't you like these things?

18:36.240 --> 18:37.520
Is it a trick to stimulate others?

18:41.400 --> 18:42.400
Then my little brother

18:43.000 --> 18:43.640
Just leave it to Boss Yu

18:43.640 --> 18:44.640
take good care of yourself

18:46.320 --> 18:47.000
before leaving

18:47.280 --> 18:48.200
I have a few words

18:48.480 --> 18:49.240
You want to give him an order?

18:50.080 --> 18:50.560
I have no idea

19:00.880 --> 19:01.320
Thanks

19:07.200 --> 19:07.760
Are you OK

19:08.080 --> 19:08.560
Out of the way

19:08.920 --> 19:09.400
I ask you

19:10.240 --> 19:10.680
forward

19:10.680 --> 19:11.760
Follow the rich

19:12.480 --> 19:13.280
Why did it appear suddenly?

19:13.440 --> 19:14.080
in a large car store

19:14.560 --> 19:16.000
I don't have time to explain

19:16.880 --> 19:17.640
I met this guy

19:17.960 --> 19:19.240
Have a drink here and listen to the show

19:20.000 --> 19:21.160
That's why I took a chance

19:21.160 --> 19:22.200
Get news here

19:22.760 --> 19:24.520
I heard it mentioned by chance at the Opera House

19:25.760 --> 19:27.280
This man is the owner of Yuelai Restaurant

19:29.440 --> 19:30.080
Yu Lai Restaurant

19:32.440 --> 19:32.800
OK

19:33.720 --> 19:34.880
I will go to this restaurant for a walk

19:35.520 --> 19:37.000
You can stay and continue asking

19:37.280 --> 19:37.720
OK

19:55.000 --> 19:55.640
Come again next time

19:57.000 --> 19:57.400
I walk slowly

19:59.000 --> 19:59.720
The president is back

20:01.520 --> 20:02.160
guest official

20:02.440 --> 20:03.240
Really sorry

20:03.520 --> 20:04.440
Where is our restaurant located?

20:04.560 --> 20:05.200
one is hard to find

20:05.240 --> 20:06.320
Today's reservations are fully booked

20:06.480 --> 20:07.200
come back next time

20:08.400 --> 20:11.200
Write a Contract Complaint Letter

20:11.640 --> 20:12.760
Cross-thesis

20:20.320 --> 20:22.000
Come and make room

20:23.000 --> 20:24.720
Come and make room

20:33.280 --> 20:34.080
This basket is made of firebush

20:34.240 --> 20:35.440
Only a few copper plates were replaced

20:36.680 --> 20:37.720
I want to earn enough gold coins

20:39.000 --> 20:40.320
This won't last eight lifetimes

20:41.960 --> 20:43.000
OK, thanks

20:53.720 --> 20:55.000
Cross one or two

20:56.160 --> 20:57.640
It feels weird when someone comes to your door

21:02.520 --> 21:03.040
Gentlemen

21:03.720 --> 21:04.720

21:05.000 --> 21:06.240

21:17.880 --> 21:19.320
The girl wrote this

21:19.720 --> 21:20.160
Gentlemen

21:20.400 --> 21:21.240
Don't just write

21:21.440 --> 21:22.080

21:22.240 --> 21:22.960
See if there are any problems

21:24.640 --> 21:25.640
read it, read it, read it

21:25.680 --> 21:27.000
There is another cost to this thinking.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.280
Now is the time to read it, right?

21:29.480 --> 21:30.040

21:31.320 --> 21:31.720

21:32.800 --> 21:33.480
That's enough for now, isn't it?

21:33.720 --> 21:34.480
You can read it now, right?

21:34.520 --> 21:35.920
Come on, read it, read it.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.040
Yes sir, please read.

21:39.520 --> 21:40.160
Speed ​​Reading

21:42.520 --> 21:44.080
yes just read it

21:44.200 --> 21:44.920
Just finished reading

21:44.920 --> 21:45.960
Xianyun is deceiving herself

21:46.240 --> 21:47.240
Fei Xingquan hates

21:47.760 --> 21:49.240
The darkness of the Yin-Han distance

21:50.000 --> 21:51.480
Enduring the journey back to Magpie Bridge

21:52.080 --> 21:53.880
If love lasts forever

21:54.480 --> 21:56.080
How are things like in the morning and evening?

21:56.160 --> 21:56.760
Xinnuo

21:56.760 --> 21:57.760

21:58.200 --> 21:59.080
Very talented

21:59.920 --> 22:00.920

22:00.920 --> 22:01.720
Yes

22:03.720 --> 22:04.240
it's my turn

22:04.480 --> 22:05.200
it's our turn

22:05.400 --> 22:06.000
Don't press

22:06.000 --> 22:06.440
Gentlemen

22:07.000 --> 22:07.560
Who is this gentleman?

22:07.720 --> 22:08.480
Who's carrying the basket here?

22:08.480 --> 22:09.280
say something say something

22:10.280 --> 22:11.920
Don’t you use your face to make money?

22:14.040 --> 22:15.160
I don't want to be with you

22:15.480 --> 22:16.240
I didn't say I wouldn't do it

22:16.320 --> 22:17.720
But you used my idea

22:17.880 --> 22:18.560
money you earn

22:19.160 --> 22:19.960
He must be half as good as me

22:21.760 --> 22:22.880
Who who? This is it

22:23.080 --> 22:23.880
this girl

22:25.160 --> 22:26.080
What do you want to write about?

22:28.400 --> 22:28.960

Do you want to write?

22:30.520 --> 22:33.320
I want to be with you

22:33.760 --> 22:34.800
fly together

22:35.680 --> 22:38.760
Flying in the world will always be with you

22:39.200 --> 22:39.720
This section is good

22:39.960 --> 22:40.800
This part is better

22:41.160 --> 22:42.200
This paragraph is much better than what I wrote

22:42.240 --> 22:42.560
write down

22:44.920 --> 22:46.080
I will also write to you later

22:47.640 --> 22:49.640
Then you have to make good arrangements

22:49.880 --> 22:50.560
don't stand in front of me

22:52.320 --> 22:52.720
sisters

22:52.800 --> 22:53.400
listen to me

22:53.680 --> 22:55.320
Let's line up and come one by one

22:55.520 --> 22:56.760
I guarantee everyone will have a copy

22:57.640 --> 22:58.480
Really really really

22:58.680 --> 22:59.280
Come on, come on, everyone, line up

22:59.280 --> 23:00.560

23:03.080 --> 23:03.960
Come one by one

23:04.000 --> 23:04.880

23:05.000 --> 23:06.400
Come back, come back

23:06.760 --> 23:08.000
Sisters, let’s talk later.

23:08.240 --> 23:09.520
Be careful, be careful not to hit

23:13.720 --> 23:14.200
ETC。

23:16.240 --> 23:17.080
I'm not done yet

23:19.680 --> 23:20.040
this

23:20.320 --> 23:21.640
This is the cost of your usual stay

23:22.240 --> 23:22.680
this

23:22.800 --> 23:23.920
This is the cost of your usual food and drink

23:24.080 --> 23:25.440
Your mother doesn’t want my meal money

23:28.640 --> 23:29.000
Yes

23:30.960 --> 23:32.320
It's amazing how you can flatter others.

23:34.200 --> 23:34.680
this is my mother

23:34.680 --> 23:35.520
The cost of pony hairpins

23:35.720 --> 23:36.480
Brother Heng is here to treat you

23:36.480 --> 23:37.080
medical expenses

23:44.000 --> 23:44.480
correct

23:45.240 --> 23:47.160
Have you underestimated your ability to make money?

23:47.640 --> 23:48.680
Why did you suddenly set up a stall?

23:52.240 --> 23:53.760
I met my compatriots two days ago

23:54.400 --> 23:55.280
he was arrested

23:56.000 --> 23:57.240
You need two hundred taels of silver to redeem yourself

23:57.960 --> 23:58.880
I need to save money for him

23:59.080 --> 24:00.480
I just went into town to write a letter for me.

24:10.960 --> 24:11.720
Real or fake?

24:16.280 --> 24:17.400
So why do you think I am?

24:24.480 --> 24:25.000
And you?

24:25.000 --> 24:26.200
very honest

24:27.480 --> 24:29.240
Well, the money is clearly divided.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.720
for your compatriots

25:16.560 --> 25:17.200
Manier

25:18.480 --> 25:19.640
Where did this hairpin come from?

25:21.320 --> 25:22.760
The money you made selling Pyracantha

25:23.280 --> 25:24.040
Bought for my mother

25:26.960 --> 25:28.000
Manel does have the ability

25:28.800 --> 25:30.000
But there are many insects and snakes on the mountain

25:30.440 --> 25:31.520
Don't go there next time

25:32.680 --> 25:34.560
Karat Varti Debs Sher Melhar

25:34.680 --> 25:35.480
He gave it to grandma

25:36.520 --> 25:37.440
But it doesn't matter

25:38.000 --> 25:39.200
I will make money in the future

25:39.800 --> 25:42.280
Buy my mother something with gold and silver.

25:42.880 --> 25:43.640
alarm

25:44.520 --> 25:45.760
despite this

25:47.080 --> 25:47.920
looks a bit simple

25:48.480 --> 25:50.480
But it would definitely look good on my mom.

25:51.720 --> 25:52.280
Not wearing it yet

25:53.400 --> 25:54.760
I was worried that if I saw my milk, something would happen again.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.880
Mom, save it for later.

26:00.000 --> 26:00.640
my mom loves it

26:05.000 --> 26:06.320
I just washed the dates

26:06.720 --> 26:07.160
a taste

26:09.800 --> 26:10.240
Sweet?

26:13.240 --> 26:13.680
taste

26:15.200 --> 26:15.800
Mom eats it too

26:16.920 --> 26:17.280
OK

26:17.520 --> 26:18.520
You eat, you eat

26:28.720 --> 26:29.680
What's wrong

26:30.000 --> 26:31.080
With a tiger face

26:31.560 --> 26:33.080
I just saw Leanne Mannner

26:34.200 --> 26:35.680
I still have the money bag in my hand

26:36.400 --> 26:38.080
The money bag is still full of money

26:39.040 --> 26:39.520
Mother

26:40.400 --> 26:41.760
Where do you think she got the money?

26:44.720 --> 26:46.440
I also saw her giving it to her third aunt

26:46.720 --> 26:48.160
I'll give you a new hairpin as a gift

26:48.800 --> 26:50.200
Look at this hair clip style

26:50.480 --> 26:51.720
Why not say one tael of silver?

26:52.240 --> 26:52.960
this is correct

26:53.320 --> 26:53.640
Mother

26:54.320 --> 26:55.200
Milk is collected every year

26:55.200 --> 26:56.720
Here's how much you can save

26:57.920 --> 26:59.560
If we allow two and three bedrooms

26:59.680 --> 27:00.240
stolen

27:00.240 --> 27:01.680
then we will suffer losses

27:04.440 --> 27:05.080
Mom will go as soon as possible

27:05.080 --> 27:06.240
Look at your third aunt’s tone

27:07.040 --> 27:07.920
Look at Ryan Mannier

27:08.640 --> 27:09.480
In the end what happened?

27:13.040 --> 27:13.720
That's right, Mom

27:14.200 --> 27:15.000
Do you take any medicine?

27:15.800 --> 27:16.720
My mom can definitely give it to me

27:16.800 --> 27:17.720
he has a younger brother

27:18.240 --> 27:19.800
Let the second aunt shut her stinky mouth

27:35.960 --> 27:36.640
Good morning, brother Nuo

27:37.400 --> 27:38.480
Early bird gets the worm

27:38.720 --> 27:39.240
Go out to the stall

27:41.040 --> 27:44.240
You and I are inseparable

27:44.480 --> 27:45.440
fly together

27:46.080 --> 27:47.400
Flying over the human world

27:47.720 --> 27:49.280
always with you

27:50.000 --> 27:51.480
The industrial chain was formed so quickly

27:52.440 --> 27:53.960
Who said it was the early bird?

27:53.960 --> 27:54.760
There are bugs to eat

27:55.480 --> 27:56.000
I read

27:56.480 --> 27:57.240
Be an early bird

27:57.240 --> 27:58.240
Was it eaten by bugs?

28:02.280 --> 28:04.040
How fast these girls can climb walls

28:04.040 --> 28:05.480
high speed

28:06.760 --> 28:08.160
To understand is to understand

28:09.720 --> 28:10.920
But I'm still picky anyway.

28:16.640 --> 28:17.920
What do these people look like?

28:20.640 --> 28:22.400
Having a good job is also a problem

28:30.720 --> 28:31.400
what do you mean

28:33.080 --> 28:34.520
Give them two, give me one

28:47.640 --> 28:48.240
little beggar

28:48.680 --> 28:50.000
Would you like to have dinner at Yuelai Restaurant?

28:51.480 --> 28:52.080
you have money

28:53.240 --> 28:53.880
Feel free to continue

28:54.400 --> 28:54.880
he goes

28:56.240 --> 28:57.400
Here you two are invited.

29:02.200 --> 29:02.640
please sit down

29:04.800 --> 29:06.280
What do you two want to eat?

29:07.480 --> 29:08.040
take a look

29:11.240 --> 29:12.400
If you have something nice to say, click on it

29:12.680 --> 29:13.080
You're welcome

29:13.560 --> 29:14.240
I'll come as soon as I leave

29:14.440 --> 29:15.280
Conscience discovered

29:15.720 --> 29:16.560
Then I won't be polite

29:17.920 --> 29:18.400
girl

29:18.640 --> 29:19.560
I'll tell you the name of the dish

29:19.920 --> 29:21.040
Our signature dishes include

29:21.240 --> 29:23.160
Steamed mutton, steamed bear feet, steamed deer tail.

29:23.320 --> 29:24.480
Roast duck, roast chicken, roast goose

29:24.720 --> 29:25.800
Braised pork, braised duck, chicken, bacon

29:25.880 --> 29:26.320
Songhua Xiaoduer

29:26.320 --> 29:26.880
dried meat sausage

29:27.000 --> 29:27.920
White Smoked Chicken Su Bao Platter

29:27.960 --> 29:28.720
Steamed papaya pig

29:28.960 --> 29:30.040
Glutinous rice duck

29:35.760 --> 29:36.320
Song Gongzi

29:36.760 --> 29:37.560
Mid-Autumn Festival tomorrow

29:38.000 --> 29:39.200
I gave you a small portion just for you

29:39.400 --> 29:40.200
I prepared some small gifts

29:44.680 --> 29:45.440
Then this batch of goods

29:45.800 --> 29:46.760
Mr. Song, is that okay?

29:46.760 --> 29:47.800
Give your children 10% more

29:48.480 --> 29:49.720
It’s not easy for you to ship your goods

29:51.760 --> 29:52.520
you mean

29:52.720 --> 29:54.000
I was not good to you before

29:55.240 --> 29:56.000
Song Song Gongzi

29:56.240 --> 29:57.560
what are you saying?

29:58.280 --> 29:58.920
Children don't dare

30:09.160 --> 30:10.160
Small, that's what people

30:10.240 --> 30:11.320
I'll give you a new pot of tea

30:23.240 --> 30:24.640
My brother came early

30:24.880 --> 30:25.720
I searched again

30:26.080 --> 30:27.440
These are just ordinary diners

30:27.760 --> 30:28.480
This leader was very moved

30:28.720 --> 30:30.040
I still need to rely on you to do things

30:30.680 --> 30:32.240
Give him ten guts

30:32.560 --> 30:33.720
He didn't dare to go behind his back

30:34.000 --> 30:34.880
listen to your news

30:36.680 --> 30:37.640
this idiot

30:38.920 --> 30:39.720
Yesterday I heard the wind

30:40.240 --> 30:41.000
This is money

30:41.560 --> 30:43.160
It's unfair to say that I shipped goods behind my back

30:44.720 --> 30:45.760
The killer is here today

30:46.040 --> 30:46.960
You're disturbing me again

30:48.400 --> 30:49.240
What bad luck

30:52.320 --> 30:53.960
Look at this beautiful laurel

30:53.960 --> 30:55.280
Already split in half

30:55.400 --> 30:57.000
Give this money to your boss and them

30:57.800 --> 30:59.280
We can only eat leftovers

31:00.040 --> 31:01.680
These people are indeed

31:01.720 --> 31:03.240
I bought it very cheaply and it works great.

31:04.640 --> 31:06.000
Who gets one or two, who gets five or six?

31:06.480 --> 31:07.400
they know very well

31:07.720 --> 31:09.240
It can't just be like this

31:09.240 --> 31:10.160
I don't remember black and white

31:11.520 --> 31:12.480
Don't worry

31:12.760 --> 31:14.040
The time of your delivery

31:14.080 --> 31:14.800
and missionaries

31:15.200 --> 31:16.520
everything is in this book

31:16.800 --> 31:18.480
Records are clear at a glance

31:19.320 --> 31:20.560
these leaders

31:20.880 --> 31:21.960
They are also in this book

31:22.200 --> 31:23.880
Registered and stamped

31:24.240 --> 31:26.000
Someone once asked him this question

31:26.560 --> 31:28.320
He can't rely on anyone

31:30.680 --> 31:31.240
OK

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
About next delivery

31:34.000 --> 31:34.720
How are arrangements going?

31:35.680 --> 31:36.520
Prince, don't worry

31:36.800 --> 31:38.280
everything is in order

31:43.280 --> 31:44.080
Click together, click together

31:51.240 --> 31:51.880
This is still a flower

31:51.880 --> 31:53.240
Which Song family do you want to marry into?

31:56.320 --> 31:56.960
That's the Song family

31:58.080 --> 31:58.640
any

31:59.480 --> 32:00.000
Which

32:02.520 --> 32:03.880
We opened many restaurants in the city

32:03.960 --> 32:04.720
The one in the bank

32:04.920 --> 32:05.440
Yes

32:06.200 --> 32:07.160
Don't you know better?

32:08.480 --> 32:09.320
this is a big family

32:09.400 --> 32:10.480
There is a second one

32:13.080 --> 32:13.720
then you will get married

32:13.720 --> 32:14.960
Who is the son of the Song family?

32:16.000 --> 32:17.480
I don't know and I don't care

32:18.640 --> 32:19.480
Why do you ask so many questions?

32:22.000 --> 32:23.960
Just ask when nothing happens

32:25.480 --> 32:26.400
Total gossip

32:30.720 --> 32:31.200
let's go

32:31.640 --> 32:32.240
I haven't eaten yet

32:33.280 --> 32:33.960
do you have money

32:34.680 --> 32:35.520
Won't you wait for me?

32:37.760 --> 32:38.520
When did you say that?

32:38.520 --> 32:39.440
i am in treatment

32:39.720 --> 32:40.760
I'm just taking you to see

32:41.160 --> 32:42.080
This is the most profitable restaurant

32:42.320 --> 32:43.080
Expand your horizons

32:43.960 --> 32:44.640
Let's go now

32:44.880 --> 32:45.920
After a while, the food was ordered.

32:46.160 --> 32:46.960
you have to pay

32:53.640 --> 32:54.480
i was cheated

32:59.760 --> 33:02.280
Who should I send this to?

33:03.200 --> 33:03.680
grandmother

33:04.680 --> 33:06.040
Manier came back at the right time

33:06.480 --> 33:08.000
Tomorrow is the Mid-Autumn Festival

33:08.640 --> 33:10.000
You can give it to Uncle Jin later.

33:10.160 --> 33:11.320
I send some packages there every month

33:11.640 --> 33:12.480
Send a message by the way

33:13.000 --> 33:14.240
Just say you owe him money

33:14.240 --> 33:15.400
make people feel comfortable

33:15.720 --> 33:17.320
The Lian family will not default on their debts

33:18.760 --> 33:19.240
this matter

33:19.480 --> 33:20.560
It would be more convenient for my uncle to go there.

33:22.040 --> 33:23.920
If your uncle goes to deliver gifts

33:23.960 --> 33:24.440
On the contrary, I think

33:24.440 --> 33:26.000
There seems to be something important

33:26.440 --> 33:27.200
Vice versa is not good

33:27.760 --> 33:29.640
More suitable for children

33:30.200 --> 33:30.720
Help yourself

33:32.560 --> 33:33.400
Go ahead, okay

33:42.480 --> 33:43.000
Finish

33:43.680 --> 33:44.640
Take what you want to eat

33:45.000 --> 33:46.240
Don't be polite to Uncle Jin.

33:46.960 --> 33:48.160
Treat this place as your own home

33:49.080 --> 33:50.080
really at home

33:50.480 --> 33:51.560
I can't think of anything to eat

33:51.560 --> 33:52.440
Take them all

33:54.920 --> 33:55.880
Why didn't I see it?

33:56.000 --> 33:56.720
Brother Yang

33:57.400 --> 33:58.440
He went to Lao Wu Tou in the west of the village

33:58.440 --> 33:59.040
He went to collect debts

33:59.240 --> 34:00.240
Will be back soon

34:01.040 --> 34:01.520
he

34:02.000 --> 34:02.520
debt collection

34:02.560 --> 34:03.000
correct

34:04.000 --> 34:04.800
Then I have to take a look

34:05.080 --> 34:05.480
Help yourself

34:09.520 --> 34:10.360
Come and get more

34:10.600 --> 34:11.880
Munir, Munir

34:26.080 --> 34:26.400
here

34:26.670 --> 34:27.400
Good sweep

34:33.480 --> 34:34.960
Put this firewood away

34:41.520 --> 34:42.760
This table is garbage

34:48.880 --> 34:51.320
my life is difficult

34:51.880 --> 34:52.520
this religion

34:53.080 --> 34:54.190
I'm only a minute and a half away

34:54.440 --> 34:55.150
not yet

34:56.440 --> 34:57.680
The next few days

34:58.480 --> 35:00.000
How should I live?

35:02.920 --> 35:03.440
Yes

35:04.600 --> 35:07.040
It's really hard for you.

35:10.480 --> 35:10.920
Brother Heng

35:12.160 --> 35:12.640
Manier

35:13.360 --> 35:14.000
How did you get here?

35:14.840 --> 35:15.280
ETC。

35:15.360 --> 35:16.320
The water used to wash the chicken is dirty

35:16.560 --> 35:17.480
I'm going to change clothes first

35:46.800 --> 35:48.480
I got this for you

35:49.320 --> 35:49.960
not much

35:51.040 --> 35:52.120
this this this

35:52.120 --> 35:52.600
he remembers

35:53.480 --> 35:54.280
you are a debt collector

35:54.280 --> 35:55.040
Not to pay off debts

35:55.480 --> 35:57.000
Why are these ears so soft?

35:57.960 --> 35:58.360
beside

35:58.800 --> 35:59.360
What if you are

35:59.360 --> 36:00.600
If you meet such an uncontrollable person again,

36:00.880 --> 36:01.560
Remember to contact me

36:01.800 --> 36:02.560
deal with this kind of person

36:03.440 --> 36:04.280
i have many ideas

36:05.000 --> 36:05.480
Manier

36:07.200 --> 36:08.000
as the saying goes

36:08.840 --> 36:10.320
I don't know whether to say it or not

36:10.760 --> 36:11.480
You're welcome

36:14.160 --> 36:14.600
No

36:16.040 --> 36:18.120
Well, I have to thank you too

36:19.480 --> 36:20.000
but

36:20.480 --> 36:22.000
This family is actually in trouble

36:23.000 --> 36:23.960
their old lady

36:24.400 --> 36:25.280
time is limited

36:26.400 --> 36:27.480
Don't look at it, this is killing chickens again

36:27.480 --> 36:28.280
Another goose massacre

36:28.840 --> 36:30.560
All this is just because we want to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival

36:31.320 --> 36:32.760
I want to leave a message to the old lady

36:33.480 --> 36:34.800
There are cows and sheep in the yard

36:36.840 --> 36:37.560
They're all borrowed

36:39.480 --> 36:40.000
compiled

36:40.400 --> 36:40.920
leave the old lady

36:40.920 --> 36:41.880
I felt comfortable when I left.

36:43.280 --> 36:44.080
Debts you have collected

36:45.200 --> 36:45.800
appreciate

36:47.160 --> 36:48.080
This is the old lady

36:48.120 --> 36:49.000
Money to buy a coffin

36:53.000 --> 36:53.480
All right

36:56.440 --> 36:57.120
When you need debt

36:57.200 --> 36:58.640
I've never seen you talk so well.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.160
Didn't make any money

37:08.560 --> 37:09.560
I also paid a dime in compensation.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.800
Manier, you are so kind.

37:12.120 --> 37:12.480
You will be in debt in the future

37:12.480 --> 37:13.320
leave me alone

37:13.640 --> 37:14.800
Please sing a song tomorrow

37:15.040 --> 37:15.560
Go together

37:15.960 --> 37:16.640
I will not go

37:17.000 --> 37:18.320
I have to make more money as soon as possible.

37:18.800 --> 37:19.600
Not bad today

37:35.440 --> 37:37.280
good weather

37:37.760 --> 37:40.160
bumper harvest

37:42.960 --> 37:44.960
good weather

37:45.360 --> 37:47.480
bumper harvest

38:30.680 --> 38:31.680
Brother Youheng, I have been waiting for a long time.

38:32.000 --> 38:32.880
I've only been here a while

38:35.160 --> 38:35.800
I have no expectations

38:36.000 --> 38:37.120
Brother Shen is also interested in this

38:37.560 --> 38:38.480
country dance

38:39.160 --> 38:39.920
but that's it

38:41.840 --> 38:42.280
Brother Yang

38:42.640 --> 38:44.160
Why sing during this Mid-Autumn Festival?

38:44.160 --> 38:45.920
All the people here are young men and women.

38:46.480 --> 38:47.640
There are many couples in the village

38:48.280 --> 38:49.840
We got to know each other when we sang together.

38:51.480 --> 38:52.480
exhibit

38:53.960 --> 38:55.600
Although it looks like square dancing

38:55.920 --> 38:56.680
but it's fun

38:57.600 --> 38:58.320
Square dance

39:01.160 --> 39:02.840
This is the kind of dance that is performed on the dam

39:12.480 --> 39:14.120
you are all ready

39:32.480 --> 39:33.000
Manier

39:39.600 --> 39:41.880
Then I'll show off my skills

39:43.880 --> 39:44.320
Together

39:48.440 --> 39:49.960
I think Brother Shen is not good at dancing

39:50.320 --> 39:50.920
Don't embarrass him

39:51.160 --> 39:51.600
let's go

40:45.080 --> 40:46.000
Won't you come?

40:47.160 --> 40:47.960
Better than nothing

41:30.640 --> 41:31.560
No matter you stay with Maner

41:31.560 --> 41:32.280
for what purpose

41:32.560 --> 41:34.320
When you're done with your work, leave quickly.

41:36.320 --> 41:37.280
Brother Ewing v. Lienman

41:37.400 --> 41:38.400
really worried

41:40.440 --> 41:41.560
Just remember my words

41:46.520 --> 41:47.600
What if I don't leave?
