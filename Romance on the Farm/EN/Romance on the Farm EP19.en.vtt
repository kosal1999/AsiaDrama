01:47.150 --> 01:47.840
young woman

01:51.350 --> 01:52.280
I saw Boss Wu

01:52.400 --> 01:53.710
We just went to Lian Man Er restaurant

01:54.150 --> 01:54.870
That vegetable cart

01:54.870 --> 01:56.280
She also took him to her restaurant.

01:57.310 --> 01:58.479
Yeah, yeah, I understand

01:58.560 --> 01:59.200
come down

02:03.470 --> 02:04.080
Mrs.

02:05.190 --> 02:06.120
your sister

02:06.190 --> 02:06.910
very smart

02:07.470 --> 02:08.520
Where did you get so much?

02:08.520 --> 02:09.680
Off-season vegetables

02:10.590 --> 02:11.080
No

02:11.560 --> 02:12.960
How do you get others to be more ambitious?

02:12.960 --> 02:14.150
destroy your prestige

02:15.630 --> 02:16.470
I'm not talking about you

02:16.910 --> 02:17.870
Why don't you come up now?

02:18.000 --> 02:18.840
Boss Cai Boss Wu

02:19.560 --> 02:21.190
How dare I do this?

02:22.280 --> 02:23.000
What should you be afraid of?

02:23.470 --> 02:24.400
Isn’t this just a few words?

02:24.400 --> 02:25.400
Is it about polite language?

02:27.870 --> 02:28.280
Rose

02:28.470 --> 02:29.680
What’s wrong with you?

02:37.079 --> 02:38.750
I'm just worried about the official

02:39.710 --> 02:41.120
I forgot what I told you

02:41.710 --> 02:42.590
Then as long as we

02:42.590 --> 02:44.030
She had a relationship with Boss Wu

02:44.590 --> 02:46.360
Not only will I be able to gain a foothold in the government in the future,

02:46.840 --> 02:47.630
that girl and brother

02:47.680 --> 02:49.560
I can look up to you too

02:50.400 --> 02:52.120
Flowers are okay

02:52.520 --> 02:53.470
There will be opportunities in the future

03:09.030 --> 03:09.560
Lord Wu

03:10.800 --> 03:12.190
These two are indeed human beings

03:12.190 --> 03:12.910
some tips

03:13.870 --> 03:16.150
Especially the young man named Shen

03:17.400 --> 03:20.470
Even though this man said he was a farmer

03:21.520 --> 03:22.360
But from the appearance

03:23.190 --> 03:25.190
Unlike ordinary people in the market

03:26.150 --> 03:28.280
He is also very experienced in what he does.

03:29.240 --> 03:30.520
he still sees me

03:32.190 --> 03:33.120
I read

03:34.520 --> 03:35.590
not simple

03:37.079 --> 03:39.190
I understand, I'll check it now

03:43.030 --> 03:43.870
What exactly?

03:44.000 --> 03:44.840
I can't tell clearly either

03:45.000 --> 03:45.840
Stop asking around

03:46.430 --> 03:47.120
It's just a store anyway

03:47.280 --> 03:48.120
things suddenly got worse

03:48.190 --> 03:48.910
Come on

03:49.360 --> 03:50.000
let me tell you

03:50.280 --> 03:51.360
Mr. Long's aunt

03:51.430 --> 03:53.360
Fresh vegetables are in high demand

03:53.590 --> 03:54.190
really

03:54.360 --> 03:55.590
Mr. Bellon's restaurant business

03:55.680 --> 03:56.710
I don’t know how many times better

03:57.430 --> 03:58.560
Heard about our restaurant

04:12.800 --> 04:13.390
flowers

04:14.040 --> 04:16.040
At least you should keep your nerves in check.

04:16.920 --> 04:17.480
then look at them

04:17.510 --> 04:18.600
You have to be in front of your mother-in-law again

04:18.680 --> 04:19.600
Say you are not

04:25.390 --> 04:28.120
Well, don't be angry all the time.

04:28.680 --> 04:30.040
this makes me angry

04:30.240 --> 04:30.950
Not worth it or not worth it

04:32.000 --> 04:33.360
Mom, what are you doing here?

04:37.040 --> 04:37.830
you are a child

04:38.560 --> 04:39.830
Mom can't come to see you yet

04:46.270 --> 04:46.950
All right

04:48.800 --> 04:50.159
Mom has thought of a way for you

04:50.720 --> 04:52.240
Let's get rid of this bad breath

04:55.120 --> 04:55.800
what to do

05:05.560 --> 05:06.040
taste

05:06.310 --> 05:09.430
The elbows are coming, the elbows are coming.

05:10.120 --> 05:11.680
Come, come, come

05:14.830 --> 05:16.870
Look, I took them all away

05:19.560 --> 05:20.070
Which

05:20.680 --> 05:21.480
let me say a few words

05:21.950 --> 05:23.240
Manier wanted to say a few words.

05:23.430 --> 05:23.920
All right

05:24.600 --> 05:25.310
thank you all

05:25.830 --> 05:27.480
Help us harvest hot spring vegetables

05:28.190 --> 05:29.240
Only suitable for our small shop

05:29.560 --> 05:30.720
attracted many customers

05:31.310 --> 05:32.480
I have promised everyone before

05:32.680 --> 05:34.000
Let's have dinner together when this is all over

05:34.480 --> 05:35.310
It wasn't until recently that I had some free time

05:36.070 --> 05:36.560
although

05:36.630 --> 05:37.680
We are a small shop

05:38.040 --> 05:38.920
Far below

05:39.000 --> 05:40.600
No other restaurant has this size

05:40.920 --> 05:41.680
but i believe

05:42.120 --> 05:42.560
us

05:42.800 --> 05:44.159
will get better and better

05:44.390 --> 05:46.240
OK OK

05:46.360 --> 05:47.720
Come on, come on, have a drink

05:47.870 --> 05:48.510
drink a bottle

05:48.830 --> 05:51.000
Come, come, come

05:51.070 --> 05:51.630
All right

05:51.870 --> 05:53.000
Thank you all, thank you all.

05:53.240 --> 05:54.120
Come, come, come

05:57.720 --> 05:59.159
Come on, come on, keep eating, eating, eating

05:59.270 --> 05:59.720
Manier

06:00.310 --> 06:01.480
Why are you so polite?

06:01.870 --> 06:03.120
We are all from the same village

06:03.560 --> 06:04.480
everyone comes to help

06:04.800 --> 06:05.480
Everything is as it should be

06:05.680 --> 06:06.070
Then it

06:06.120 --> 06:06.720
besides it

06:07.070 --> 06:08.310
Your job needs to be done well

06:08.510 --> 06:09.120
future

06:09.360 --> 06:11.310
She opened another restaurant and hotel

06:11.680 --> 06:13.070
Unemployed people in our village

06:13.360 --> 06:15.160
everyone goes there to find a job

06:15.360 --> 06:16.120
Yes

06:16.240 --> 06:17.600
What you said to my father was right.

06:18.040 --> 06:18.870
my father was right

06:19.240 --> 06:19.720
I've said it before

06:19.830 --> 06:21.750
This restaurant could definitely do well, though.

06:22.000 --> 06:22.560
That's it, that's right

06:22.630 --> 06:23.510
Watch the door now

06:23.630 --> 06:24.390
that threshold

06:24.630 --> 06:25.720
It's almost crushing.

06:25.870 --> 06:26.800
not good

06:27.270 --> 06:28.040
I'm talking about our store

06:28.390 --> 06:29.630
Open at this angle

06:29.800 --> 06:30.160
alley

06:30.270 --> 06:31.070
Very good workmanship

06:31.360 --> 06:32.680
We're going to drive to that popular store down the street

06:33.070 --> 06:33.920
this work

06:34.800 --> 06:35.270
Nothing can compare to flowers

06:35.360 --> 06:36.430
a hundred times better

06:36.560 --> 06:37.950
real, real, real

06:38.720 --> 06:39.600
Yes

06:40.750 --> 06:41.310
I say Munir

06:42.120 --> 06:42.830
Where are your parents?

06:43.159 --> 06:44.159
Why don't you contact them here?

06:44.390 --> 06:45.040
my mother said

06:45.070 --> 06:46.360
winter my grandma

06:47.000 --> 06:47.800
Always eat pickles

06:48.120 --> 06:49.830
so follow me

06:50.040 --> 06:51.870
I sent a lot of hot spring vegetables there

06:52.070 --> 06:53.190
I think it will take a few days to come back

06:54.120 --> 06:54.830
Very filial

06:55.600 --> 06:56.070
shop owner

06:56.390 --> 06:56.950
The yard is full

06:57.040 --> 06:58.070
Tomorrow's dish

06:58.310 --> 06:59.510
Let’s take stock quickly.

07:00.070 --> 07:00.430
OK

07:00.630 --> 07:01.830
There are still many dishes in the kitchen that have not been served.

07:01.950 --> 07:02.800
Everyone eat slowly

07:02.950 --> 07:03.800
All right

07:04.000 --> 07:05.480
Just get busy, get busy.

07:09.430 --> 07:09.950
Manier

07:18.920 --> 07:19.390
royal

07:24.240 --> 07:24.920
it's beautiful

07:28.310 --> 07:30.160
this looks expensive

07:30.560 --> 07:31.240
i can't accept

07:32.040 --> 07:32.510
he accepts

07:33.159 --> 07:33.560
look

07:34.040 --> 07:35.040
Only the white jade box

07:35.240 --> 07:36.750
Only then can I match that color

07:37.120 --> 07:38.159
I made it specially for you

07:38.560 --> 07:39.630
If you draw it, it will definitely look good.

07:45.360 --> 07:45.920
Thanks

07:46.360 --> 07:47.800
let me sell red here

07:48.680 --> 07:50.390
you gave me a lot of money

07:50.920 --> 07:51.830
I gave you nothing

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
What a decent gift?

07:54.430 --> 07:55.430
i must thank you

07:56.159 --> 07:57.070
A customer walks into the store

07:57.680 --> 07:59.560
Maybe I'm here for your lipstick.

08:00.040 --> 08:00.750
it was you who helped me

08:01.040 --> 08:01.600
No

08:03.830 --> 08:04.240
Thanks

08:05.160 --> 08:05.680
admiration

08:06.720 --> 08:07.190
look

08:09.560 --> 08:10.560
what are you doing here?

08:10.870 --> 08:11.310
No

08:13.870 --> 08:14.600
What's this?

08:15.510 --> 08:16.510
This is Manier

08:17.800 --> 08:19.000
this is very beautiful

08:21.510 --> 08:22.000
Yes

08:22.510 --> 08:23.680
You can also make one for your mom.

08:28.790 --> 08:29.390
What a dexterous hand

08:31.390 --> 08:32.630
Make the most of everything

08:34.600 --> 08:35.000
No

08:36.030 --> 08:36.480
you

08:36.870 --> 08:38.150
My mother didn't mean it

08:38.549 --> 08:40.150
Yeah yeah yeah

09:38.600 --> 09:39.840
I squatted all morning

09:40.080 --> 09:40.840
I'm not done yet

09:41.600 --> 09:43.080
Mother

09:43.870 --> 09:45.200
my stomach hurts

09:45.720 --> 09:47.120
I can't stand mom

09:47.480 --> 09:49.000
Who asked you to eat alone?

09:49.150 --> 09:49.670
you deserved

09:49.840 --> 09:51.480
What's wrong with me?

09:55.000 --> 09:56.840
Who has milk in it?

09:56.960 --> 09:57.870
I want to go to the hut

09:58.030 --> 09:58.440
your mother

09:58.670 --> 10:00.000
Squat, squat, squat, squat every morning

10:08.200 --> 10:09.550
I had frequent vomiting and diarrhea.

10:12.240 --> 10:13.750
Open the door, Leanne Manier

10:14.080 --> 10:15.390
Leanne Mannner, get out of here

10:16.200 --> 10:17.440
Come out

10:17.440 --> 10:18.550
Ryan Manner

10:19.510 --> 10:20.200
Ryan Manner

10:21.840 --> 10:22.440
Ryan Manner

10:22.510 --> 10:23.000
go out

10:23.670 --> 10:24.200
Ryan Manner

10:25.480 --> 10:26.670
uncle and aunt

10:27.080 --> 10:28.000
What’s wrong with you?

10:28.150 --> 10:29.150
What happened to us, you ask?

10:30.030 --> 10:31.150
at the restaurant last night

10:31.600 --> 10:32.630
What do you give us to eat?

10:32.750 --> 10:33.120
Yes

10:33.240 --> 10:33.670
What do you want to eat?

10:33.790 --> 10:34.510
nothing to eat

10:34.870 --> 10:35.670
Dongpo Pork Knuckle

10:35.960 --> 10:36.550
fish soup

10:36.790 --> 10:37.360
Fried mountain bamboo shoots

10:37.670 --> 10:38.150
small vegetables

10:38.270 --> 10:38.840
Manil Manil

10:39.200 --> 10:39.840
you still have time

10:39.840 --> 10:40.720
Are you reporting the name of the dish here?

10:41.120 --> 10:42.030
Your second uncle is very nice

10:42.150 --> 10:43.120
The bottom is almost leaking.

10:43.240 --> 10:43.960
They all have diarrhea

10:44.120 --> 10:45.150
I took everything out

10:45.320 --> 10:46.670
I just returned to the village last night

10:47.030 --> 10:48.440
I have vomiting and diarrhea

10:48.750 --> 10:50.120
I couldn't go on that morning

10:50.390 --> 10:51.120
You just came to my door

10:51.360 --> 10:51.630
No

10:51.630 --> 10:52.240
impossible

10:52.440 --> 10:53.390
I've had this meal too

10:53.670 --> 10:54.030
look

10:54.150 --> 10:55.360
I have no problem at all

10:55.550 --> 10:56.030
is that possible

10:56.440 --> 10:57.670
Or should we lie to you?

10:58.030 --> 10:59.550
There's just something wrong with your food

11:00.320 --> 11:00.720
return

11:00.910 --> 11:01.550
you treat us

11:02.150 --> 11:02.720
return

11:03.200 --> 11:04.600
I will notify the official immediately

11:05.320 --> 11:06.240
Notify administrator immediately

11:06.240 --> 11:06.790
have something to say

11:06.910 --> 11:07.960
How do we get there?

11:10.270 --> 11:10.910
what happened

11:11.870 --> 11:12.840
They said they ate our food

11:12.960 --> 11:13.600
Vomiting and diarrhea

11:13.960 --> 11:14.670
Poisoned

11:15.150 --> 11:16.030
Fix it quickly

11:16.720 --> 11:17.550
Please stay calm everyone

11:18.150 --> 11:18.870
this matter

11:19.200 --> 11:20.120
we will find a solution

11:20.630 --> 11:21.080
if this is true

11:21.200 --> 11:22.120
There's something wrong with our meals

11:22.670 --> 11:23.550
We must be responsible to the end

11:26.750 --> 11:27.150
look

11:27.550 --> 11:28.550
This is a huge delay

11:29.390 --> 11:30.600
hurry up

11:34.670 --> 11:35.240
listen to me

11:35.440 --> 11:36.030
Miss Manier

11:36.510 --> 11:37.600
I want to treat you to a nice meal

11:37.840 --> 11:38.240
Manier

11:38.600 --> 11:39.270
Find Wang Youheng quickly

11:42.000 --> 11:42.270
Don't worry

11:42.320 --> 11:43.240
Manil, don't go

11:43.240 --> 11:43.960
I have to give you an explanation

11:44.600 --> 11:45.510
I have to give you an explanation

12:07.510 --> 12:08.480
Brother Heng, come with me

12:09.510 --> 12:10.550
Where is Manier going?

12:10.910 --> 12:11.720
Many people in the village are sick

12:11.870 --> 12:12.390
Go and have a look

12:12.750 --> 12:13.200
Manier

12:15.150 --> 12:15.670
I

12:16.910 --> 12:17.720
I dont go

12:19.240 --> 12:19.960
you go to town

12:21.870 --> 12:23.120
Find a real doctor

12:28.840 --> 12:30.200
Are you still worried about this?

12:34.320 --> 12:34.750
Brother Heng

12:37.150 --> 12:37.670
so now

12:38.000 --> 12:39.030
someone else died

12:39.150 --> 12:39.960
lie in front of you

12:40.080 --> 12:40.790
Will you save?

12:44.120 --> 12:45.000
if you say no

12:45.440 --> 12:46.030
I will leave immediately

12:46.150 --> 12:46.870
Find another doctor

12:48.030 --> 12:48.550
but if you have

12:48.670 --> 12:49.600
A trace of hesitation

12:51.440 --> 12:52.720
This proves that you haven't given up yet

13:13.630 --> 13:14.270
where are people

13:32.440 --> 13:33.240
come over

13:36.960 --> 13:37.840
Yes, are you still in pain?

13:38.910 --> 13:39.670
Feeling better

13:41.670 --> 13:42.120
beautiful

13:42.480 --> 13:43.270
I put you down

13:49.440 --> 13:50.120
I am actually

13:50.720 --> 13:52.440
Don't worry, sit down first

13:55.790 --> 13:56.270
Xinnuo

13:57.000 --> 13:57.440
Come quickly

14:02.000 --> 14:03.240
The eldest son is here

14:03.630 --> 14:04.750
Let me show it to your second aunt first.

14:05.080 --> 14:05.630
OK

14:06.750 --> 14:07.790
Come on, second aunt

14:08.030 --> 14:08.480
let me take your pulse

14:09.030 --> 14:10.150
Come on, come on, take a look

14:10.360 --> 14:11.320
I told you

14:11.790 --> 14:13.030
Why did you want to see it first?

14:13.390 --> 14:13.910
go! go! go

14:14.120 --> 14:14.790
this is my baby

14:16.440 --> 14:16.840
Ewing

14:17.600 --> 14:18.200
Come one by one

14:18.440 --> 14:19.670
everyone will be treated

14:19.870 --> 14:20.480
look at yourself

14:20.840 --> 14:21.200
All right

14:21.320 --> 14:23.480
I've suffered a lot.

14:25.080 --> 14:25.510
What's up with her

14:26.240 --> 14:27.120
I'll give the needle first

14:28.510 --> 14:29.870
This time I went to the hut again and again

14:30.030 --> 14:30.600
I really can't stand it anymore

14:30.720 --> 14:32.440
Poke me first, poke me first.

14:33.510 --> 14:34.790
I'm anxious too

14:34.960 --> 14:35.550
Don't be messy, don't be messy

14:35.720 --> 14:36.320
don't worry don't worry

14:36.510 --> 14:37.320
don't worry don't worry

14:39.750 --> 14:40.200
hurry up

14:40.750 --> 14:42.000
I'm anxious too

14:42.150 --> 14:42.750
successively

14:42.910 --> 14:43.510
successively

14:44.440 --> 14:44.840
successively

14:46.440 --> 14:46.750
All right

14:46.870 --> 14:47.360
successively

14:47.440 --> 14:47.840
successively

14:48.240 --> 14:48.840
everything can be treated

14:49.030 --> 14:49.720
Don't worry

14:50.510 --> 14:51.150
Don't be messy, don't be messy

14:51.550 --> 14:52.030
successively

14:52.270 --> 14:53.150
Don't mess around, don't mess around, don't mess around

14:54.510 --> 14:55.000
hurry up

14:55.720 --> 14:56.480
All right

15:01.480 --> 15:02.510
What's the situation now?

15:05.630 --> 15:06.200
dad

15:08.080 --> 15:08.600
Both

15:16.720 --> 15:17.550
Don't panic everyone

15:18.320 --> 15:19.150
severe acupuncture

15:19.750 --> 15:20.510
If the condition is mild, you can take medicine

15:21.270 --> 15:22.030
Stop diarrhea immediately

15:22.510 --> 15:23.000
Manier

15:23.600 --> 15:25.150
Can you find a way to buy fresh garlic?

15:25.750 --> 15:27.750
Sear the garlic, peel and serve

15:28.080 --> 15:29.630
It can relieve diarrhea and abdominal pain

15:29.910 --> 15:30.320
Go quickly

15:30.910 --> 15:31.200
OK

15:31.360 --> 15:32.200
Is this garlic useful?

15:32.390 --> 15:33.360
Is it useful?

15:33.630 --> 15:34.240
hurry up

15:37.910 --> 15:38.720
What are you doing so quickly?

15:38.840 --> 15:39.270
I am not in a hurry

15:42.000 --> 15:42.720
Why are you still standing there?

15:44.150 --> 15:44.870
Take off your shoes first

15:44.870 --> 15:45.150
Come

15:45.150 --> 15:45.390
no no

15:45.550 --> 15:46.270
Don't bully me

15:50.750 --> 15:51.120
No, no

15:51.240 --> 15:52.000
Don't bully me

15:52.630 --> 15:53.440
No, no

15:56.960 --> 15:57.510
they treat us

15:58.270 --> 15:59.080
Believe in Lao Jin

16:00.080 --> 16:00.480
give others

16:02.270 --> 16:02.840
How is it going

16:03.270 --> 16:03.870
Are you OK

16:11.720 --> 16:12.720
The doctor gave him an injection

16:13.000 --> 16:14.270
Zaha, you

16:14.910 --> 16:15.240
OK

16:21.720 --> 16:22.440
Don't be messy, don't be messy

16:22.630 --> 16:23.000
presentable

16:23.120 --> 16:24.030
They will all be healed.

16:28.870 --> 16:29.630
Can I leave?

16:29.720 --> 16:30.670
It would be nice to be able to walk

16:30.670 --> 16:31.720
thank you very much doctor

16:31.870 --> 16:32.510
Slow down, slow down

16:44.750 --> 16:45.240
dad

16:49.080 --> 16:49.600
How can you

16:53.790 --> 16:55.120
Your father and I are both fourteen or fifteen years old

16:55.550 --> 16:56.960
I studied medicine with my teacher.

16:58.440 --> 16:59.110
only

16:59.880 --> 17:00.830
Later he surrendered

17:09.069 --> 17:09.640
son

17:11.240 --> 17:12.000
you know

17:13.109 --> 17:15.640
What do doctors fear most?

17:19.640 --> 17:20.310
perhaps

17:21.750 --> 17:22.829
he faces death

17:27.270 --> 17:29.830
Death is inevitable in life

17:31.480 --> 17:32.510
The scariest thing is

17:33.590 --> 17:35.240
It's the pain of falling into death

17:36.750 --> 17:37.590
destroyed

17:39.920 --> 17:42.000
That's why your father and I

17:42.960 --> 17:44.000
He gave up practicing medicine

17:47.310 --> 17:49.030
I didn't agree with you studying medicine before

17:50.110 --> 17:51.200
I believe in practicing medicine

17:51.550 --> 17:52.550
It's better to charge interest

17:53.310 --> 17:55.400
really comfortable

17:58.070 --> 17:58.880
My father doesn't want you either

17:59.000 --> 18:00.270
Walking my old path again

18:03.440 --> 18:04.440
but i have never seen you

18:04.590 --> 18:06.270
Save people without hesitation

18:07.680 --> 18:08.400
I know

18:09.310 --> 18:10.550
Your son is better than me

18:11.790 --> 18:13.200
If you really like this job

18:14.200 --> 18:14.830
do not give up

18:16.510 --> 18:17.750
not because of accident

18:18.350 --> 18:19.200
lose it and move on

18:19.270 --> 18:20.550
Opportunity to save a life

18:25.270 --> 18:26.200
If one day

18:26.880 --> 18:27.960
if you don't want to do this anymore

18:29.310 --> 18:30.350
Daddy takes care of you, kid.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.510
Uncle Jin, brother Heng

18:49.720 --> 18:50.830
thank you very much today

18:51.310 --> 18:51.830
without you

18:51.830 --> 18:52.720
I don't even know what to do anymore

18:53.750 --> 18:54.270
but

18:54.640 --> 18:55.640
I'm lucky today

18:56.070 --> 18:57.790
I saw Uncle Jin showing off his skills

18:58.310 --> 18:59.200
And Brother Yang

19:02.880 --> 19:03.510
Can you judge?

19:03.640 --> 19:04.400
these villagers

19:04.510 --> 19:05.640
What did you eat that caused the emergency?

19:07.310 --> 19:08.270
Now, emergency personnel are called

19:08.640 --> 19:09.590
I forgot to tell you in detail

19:10.400 --> 19:11.030
when i take my pulse

19:11.200 --> 19:12.510
He found that these people had irregular pulses

19:13.030 --> 19:13.920
Manier called the villagers yesterday

19:14.030 --> 19:14.680
that meal

19:14.960 --> 19:15.880
These are home-cooked dishes

19:16.400 --> 19:17.030
Speak logically

19:17.510 --> 19:17.880
will not cause

19:17.880 --> 19:18.790
causing such serious consequences

19:19.510 --> 19:19.830
so

19:20.160 --> 19:20.790
There is only one possibility

19:22.310 --> 19:22.920
that meal

19:23.550 --> 19:24.680
Because someone dropped something

19:27.640 --> 19:29.590
They have obvious symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea

19:30.960 --> 19:31.640
This is rhubarb

19:32.790 --> 19:34.680
Rhubarb is weakly toxic and slow to take effect

19:35.310 --> 19:36.030
So the villagers

19:36.200 --> 19:37.160
Eat Maha meal

19:37.550 --> 19:38.550
Will not be poisoned immediately

19:39.400 --> 19:40.480
smells good

19:40.880 --> 19:42.030
not easily noticed

19:42.920 --> 19:45.000
Excessive consumption can cause diarrhea

19:46.590 --> 19:47.030
Ewing

19:47.310 --> 19:48.960
You go to the restaurant with Maner

19:49.510 --> 19:50.960
See if you can find anything

19:51.880 --> 19:53.310
I'm going to walk around these people's houses.

19:53.790 --> 19:54.880
make sure they are ok

19:55.160 --> 19:55.510
OK

19:55.880 --> 19:56.640
I will go with you

20:11.200 --> 20:11.680
look

20:12.640 --> 20:13.200
This is from a wet bucket

20:13.310 --> 20:13.920
refining

20:14.510 --> 20:15.400
It is also mixed with some other vegetables

20:15.880 --> 20:16.590
Can you find out anything?

20:25.920 --> 20:26.400
in

20:39.750 --> 20:40.270
found it

20:42.350 --> 20:42.880
What

20:44.200 --> 20:45.030
Rawand Hakkar

20:45.720 --> 20:46.480
this is a big leak

20:46.790 --> 20:48.030
Mild abdominal pain and diarrhea after eating

20:48.030 --> 20:48.680
anorexia

20:49.400 --> 20:50.350
In severe cases, it can be life-threatening

20:53.880 --> 20:54.920
This is such a brutal attack

20:55.400 --> 20:55.790
he goes

20:59.000 --> 21:00.110
Mr. Yamen, you are right

21:00.110 --> 21:00.640
Someone notified the official

21:00.790 --> 21:01.640
tell me about your restaurant

21:01.750 --> 21:02.590
Food is not clean

21:03.030 --> 21:04.110
They ordered us to check

21:04.640 --> 21:06.160
All products in our store

21:06.160 --> 21:07.160
Never allowed to be taken away

21:08.160 --> 21:08.960
This is the file

21:09.590 --> 21:10.310
you listen to me

21:10.590 --> 21:11.480
we were framed

21:11.920 --> 21:12.310
have you seen

21:12.480 --> 21:13.350
There's rhubarb on this spoon

21:13.400 --> 21:14.000
is evidence

21:14.350 --> 21:16.480
This alone does not prove anything

21:16.720 --> 21:17.310
Mr. Yamen

21:17.920 --> 21:18.830
Please treat this issue fairly

21:19.350 --> 21:20.030
Give us back our innocence

21:20.310 --> 21:21.070
innocent

21:21.240 --> 21:22.880
Let’s wait until we adults know about it.

21:23.160 --> 21:23.720
You guys go out first

21:23.880 --> 21:24.750
We'll put our stamp on it.

21:25.030 --> 21:26.030
fraternity seal

21:26.310 --> 21:26.750
Yes

21:34.400 --> 21:35.240
Who reported this case?

21:36.960 --> 21:37.720
Our store is very popular

21:38.480 --> 21:39.310
Who is the most jealous?

21:53.880 --> 21:54.830
Take the money and leave immediately

22:29.270 --> 22:30.070
Stop looking for it

22:30.920 --> 22:32.790
This restaurant has been closed by the government

22:33.240 --> 22:34.310
The door cannot be opened

22:36.680 --> 22:38.030
It turned out to be the owner Lian

22:38.790 --> 22:39.440
Even the shopkeeper

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
it spreads everywhere

22:41.270 --> 22:43.310
Your hot spring vegetables are poisonous

22:43.680 --> 22:45.400
You said you wouldn't run away from the spotlight

22:46.160 --> 22:47.440
what are you doing here?

22:47.790 --> 22:48.200
aunt

22:48.590 --> 22:49.400
My food is not poisonous

22:51.070 --> 22:51.680
non-toxic

22:51.880 --> 22:52.830
The government also took away your house

22:52.920 --> 22:54.640
This store is closed

22:56.350 --> 22:57.350
we were framed

22:58.510 --> 22:59.270
but we found it

22:59.350 --> 23:00.240
Evidence of being framed

23:00.830 --> 23:01.720
But officials don’t believe it

23:03.480 --> 23:04.160
no chance to explain

23:04.240 --> 23:04.830
Not even for us

23:05.590 --> 23:06.680
God knows what you did

23:07.400 --> 23:08.070
I will definitely put this down

23:08.110 --> 23:08.680
Discover

23:09.110 --> 23:10.590
Let this store reopen

23:26.590 --> 23:27.270
Sister Munir

23:28.790 --> 23:29.270
Sister Hoyer

23:30.030 --> 23:31.270
where are we going?

23:32.200 --> 23:32.720
go home

23:33.640 --> 23:34.350
It's better to go home

23:34.750 --> 23:35.440
Do you want to go home?

23:35.510 --> 23:36.680
it can be calm and quiet

23:37.480 --> 23:38.400
How do I look?

23:38.790 --> 23:39.400
A life of hard work

23:39.920 --> 23:40.440
look

23:41.270 --> 23:42.000
I am very busy

23:49.310 --> 23:50.480
I am sister

23:50.790 --> 23:52.480
I still have to give you some advice.

23:53.590 --> 23:54.440
this is work

23:54.720 --> 23:56.310
I still don't know how to do a lot of tricks

23:56.680 --> 23:57.720
Are you saying there's something in this?

23:57.830 --> 23:59.440
Looks new and strange

23:59.750 --> 24:01.270
But it’s also easy to have problems

24:02.030 --> 24:03.030
Doing business still requires this

24:03.200 --> 24:04.070
Sister is like this

24:04.510 --> 24:05.350
safety and health

24:05.510 --> 24:06.720
Only in this way can you have the last laugh

24:08.200 --> 24:10.440
It's work

24:11.590 --> 24:12.830
you will be fine

24:16.790 --> 24:17.350
Sister Hoyer

24:18.750 --> 24:19.750
I hope

24:21.240 --> 24:22.640
you didn't do this

24:47.750 --> 24:48.960
Are you really thinking about this?

24:50.030 --> 24:50.920
It was Lian Hua'er who did it

24:52.920 --> 24:53.440
uncertain

24:54.720 --> 24:55.680
The means are very evil

24:56.200 --> 24:56.920
I hope it's not her

24:58.750 --> 24:59.640
It just happened

25:00.960 --> 25:02.000
Yemen brings official documents

25:02.110 --> 25:02.830
Lai Fung Restaurant

25:03.400 --> 25:05.070
This speed is indeed doubtful

25:06.480 --> 25:07.400
This is the person who informed the official

25:08.200 --> 25:09.110
Eighty percent are poisonous

25:09.240 --> 25:10.030
we are in a group

25:13.640 --> 25:14.920
Regardless of whether Lian Hua'er did it or not

25:15.480 --> 25:16.750
I'll look into this matter

25:19.640 --> 25:20.350
Brother Heng said

25:21.160 --> 25:22.070
He accidentally ate rhubarb

25:22.480 --> 25:23.640
In severe cases, it may be life-threatening

25:25.110 --> 25:25.880
because of mistakes

25:26.640 --> 25:27.350
many villagers

25:29.720 --> 25:30.750
Just thinking about it scares me

25:40.550 --> 25:41.070
Don't worry

25:42.480 --> 25:43.160
it will disappear

25:46.200 --> 25:46.720
at the moment

25:46.960 --> 25:47.960
The restaurant is closed

25:48.880 --> 25:50.400
Rumors about poisonous restaurant food

25:51.790 --> 25:53.000
will spread soon

25:54.640 --> 25:55.880
Such a bad reputation

25:56.480 --> 25:57.310
This is impossible for us

25:57.350 --> 25:58.200
in a short period of time

25:58.640 --> 26:00.960
Create new stores and start new businesses

26:02.400 --> 26:03.790
Then go to Jinyang

26:07.590 --> 26:08.830
Is there no hope?

26:09.640 --> 26:10.310
not to mention

26:11.480 --> 26:12.480
In order to get close to Wu Zhonglian

26:16.790 --> 26:17.720
The matter remains unresolved

26:18.750 --> 26:19.680
Maybe everything is not so hopeless

26:21.640 --> 26:22.350
How to say

26:23.920 --> 26:24.830
Do you remember Wu Zhonglian?

26:24.830 --> 26:25.790
When you come to our restaurant

26:26.430 --> 26:28.110
Do you agree to let me deliver food?

26:31.920 --> 26:33.310
But the food in our restaurant

26:33.350 --> 26:34.160
Everything is poisonous

26:35.240 --> 26:36.240
Is now the right time?

26:38.590 --> 26:39.480
Instead of sitting and waiting to die

26:40.790 --> 26:41.790
It's better to strike first

27:11.790 --> 27:12.400
Brother Shen

27:17.640 --> 27:18.480
Brother Shen

27:19.640 --> 27:20.640
What does it mean?

27:21.830 --> 27:22.590
Sorry to bother Mr. Wu.

27:23.550 --> 27:24.880
This used to be in my restaurant

27:25.400 --> 27:26.430
The food I promised you

27:26.750 --> 27:27.510
I have sent you

27:32.550 --> 27:33.440
as far as I know

27:34.590 --> 27:36.400
Brother Shen’s hot spring dishes

27:36.790 --> 27:37.720
has a problem

27:38.830 --> 27:40.070
Seized by the government

27:41.720 --> 27:42.680
how dare you

27:43.000 --> 27:44.070
Give me

27:46.440 --> 27:47.000
What happened?

27:47.070 --> 27:48.000
I can't even hide it from Mr. Wu.

27:49.030 --> 27:50.480
But King Wu had foresight

27:51.070 --> 27:52.480
They are incomparable to ordinary people

27:53.400 --> 27:55.240
Is there something wrong with my dish?

27:56.350 --> 27:57.000
i think you'll have it

27:57.070 --> 27:57.790
special judgment

28:01.510 --> 28:02.920
Brother Shen is here

28:04.000 --> 28:05.350
Not just for food delivery, right?

28:08.160 --> 28:08.880
again

28:10.440 --> 28:11.510
I want to join Jinyangxing

28:13.640 --> 28:14.920
But your store

28:15.680 --> 28:16.750
closed

28:18.240 --> 28:18.750
Lord Wu

28:19.720 --> 28:20.960
I'm in trouble today

28:21.550 --> 28:23.000
It's because I'm in this place

28:23.480 --> 28:24.160
no supporters

28:24.680 --> 28:25.640
I will make those who hate me

28:25.680 --> 28:26.510
Autocratic

28:32.110 --> 28:32.590
Lord Wu

28:33.880 --> 28:35.270
I don't want you to help me

28:36.000 --> 28:37.160
but if i could find out

28:37.750 --> 28:39.110
Can you let me join Jinyangxing?

28:40.310 --> 28:41.480
From now on, I will rely on Mr. Wu to make a living.

28:54.640 --> 28:55.240
vegetable

28:56.480 --> 28:57.240
I accept

29:00.070 --> 29:02.680
As for can I join Jinyangxing?

29:05.030 --> 29:07.030
This time it depends on your ability

29:12.070 --> 29:13.240
Then I would first like to thank Teacher Wu.

29:16.270 --> 29:16.790
bid farewell

29:38.350 --> 29:38.830
Manier

29:39.640 --> 29:40.400
Manier

29:41.640 --> 29:42.200
Manier

29:44.790 --> 29:45.350
Manier

29:46.240 --> 29:46.640
Manier

29:47.240 --> 29:48.680
As soon as I entered the hospital, I heard Yer say

29:48.880 --> 29:49.960
Your restaurant is closed

29:50.310 --> 29:51.110
How is this going

29:51.400 --> 29:52.270
I am anxious

29:53.550 --> 29:55.160
just a few days ago

29:55.750 --> 29:57.680
She asked the villagers to help pick vegetables

29:57.880 --> 29:58.480
Have a meal

29:59.440 --> 30:00.070
I have no expectations

30:00.590 --> 30:02.960
Everyone has vomiting and diarrhea

30:04.070 --> 30:05.200
The government also knows

30:05.590 --> 30:06.510
So it was banned

30:06.960 --> 30:07.440
He knew it early

30:07.720 --> 30:08.200
we won't go

30:08.200 --> 30:09.200
I brought food to your grandma

30:09.550 --> 30:10.000
At least

30:10.310 --> 30:11.550
Mom can help you monitor this

30:11.790 --> 30:12.200
Manier

30:13.160 --> 30:13.830
If this government

30:14.000 --> 30:14.880
If you want to find someone

30:15.240 --> 30:16.590
You blame this on my father

30:16.920 --> 30:17.590
Dad will take care of it

30:18.310 --> 30:19.070
It's okay, dad

30:20.110 --> 30:20.480
this matter

30:20.720 --> 30:22.400
The restaurant is closed when the sky is high

30:23.480 --> 30:24.880
Someone was obviously framed

30:25.830 --> 30:26.720
Wait until the government finds out

30:27.240 --> 30:28.830
Can be opened normally again

30:29.200 --> 30:29.830
That's not it

30:30.070 --> 30:30.790
All right

30:31.350 --> 30:32.070
How many times have you encountered

30:32.070 --> 30:32.830
that kind of thing

30:33.310 --> 30:33.920
every time

30:34.310 --> 30:35.480
I tried my best to solve everything

30:35.880 --> 30:37.550
It will be fine this time too

30:38.750 --> 30:39.160
but

30:39.400 --> 30:40.550
Go get some rest.

30:40.720 --> 30:41.720
Manier, let me tell you.

30:42.200 --> 30:43.350
My parents believe in you

30:43.960 --> 30:45.160
but if something happens

30:45.480 --> 30:46.680
You should tell your parents promptly

30:46.960 --> 30:48.110
I can't bear it alone

30:48.400 --> 30:48.960
Okay, okay, okay

30:49.200 --> 30:49.550
Then it

30:49.720 --> 30:50.310
Go home, go home

30:51.480 --> 30:52.920
Is there anything else I want to say?

30:53.070 --> 30:54.200
All right

30:55.070 --> 30:56.200
This time they are all back

30:56.590 --> 30:57.240
Go to bed quickly

31:05.310 --> 31:05.830
Where is Hinnu?

31:06.510 --> 31:07.110
to gaze

31:07.750 --> 31:08.750
Who are you looking at? Lian Huaier?

31:09.790 --> 31:11.160
If as we expected

31:11.830 --> 31:13.680
Lian Huaier was the one who poisoned her

31:14.110 --> 31:15.880
So do you think she will be stupid?

31:16.070 --> 31:16.790
do it yourself

31:19.440 --> 31:20.310
So if I were her

31:20.790 --> 31:22.110
I sent someone to do it

31:23.070 --> 31:24.640
What will you do next?

31:26.750 --> 31:27.440
certainly

31:28.070 --> 31:29.680
I can't let people stay with me anymore.

31:30.510 --> 31:31.110
To keep him away

31:31.480 --> 31:31.880
correct

31:32.830 --> 31:33.400
Mr. Lang

31:33.550 --> 31:35.160
We found out who left the Song family

31:35.640 --> 31:36.480
He is staring at this person

31:36.750 --> 31:38.160
See what you can touch

31:39.510 --> 31:40.070
beautiful

31:41.000 --> 31:42.350
Although Shen Nuo is already investigating

31:42.920 --> 31:44.110
But the truth is still unclear

31:44.790 --> 31:45.750
We cannot stand idly by and wait for death

31:55.070 --> 31:55.920
Want to use your rewards?

31:55.920 --> 31:57.310
Find the person who framed the restaurant

31:59.510 --> 32:00.550
Will this trick work?

32:00.960 --> 32:02.240
What I want is a fight

32:02.790 --> 32:04.350
The more people know, the better

32:04.720 --> 32:06.960
Even if someone rewards you with money

32:07.270 --> 32:08.200
It is also through these people

32:08.480 --> 32:10.070
Spread the word about rewards

32:10.920 --> 32:12.200
Just like that, the wind blows together

32:12.480 --> 32:13.030
the person who started

32:13.110 --> 32:14.720
I found that all the plants around me were surrounded by soldiers.

32:15.270 --> 32:16.920
When you are stressed, your shortcomings are exposed.

32:18.920 --> 32:19.270
Which

32:19.680 --> 32:20.440
that's what you said

32:20.440 --> 32:22.070
Are there any mistakes in what you wrote?

32:23.200 --> 32:23.790
what is the problem?

32:24.200 --> 32:25.030
look here

32:29.830 --> 32:31.110
One piece of news fifty taels

32:31.480 --> 32:31.960
such a high price

32:32.070 --> 32:32.960
Who would believe it?

32:33.480 --> 32:34.480
You don't understand that, do you?

32:34.830 --> 32:35.240
look

32:35.440 --> 32:36.270
You write these rewards

32:36.480 --> 32:37.720
You'll be surprised if you see it with your own eyes

32:37.920 --> 32:39.160
What if I post this?

32:39.350 --> 32:40.640
When the others saw this scene, they went crazy with excitement.

32:40.830 --> 32:41.350
more useful

32:41.510 --> 32:42.480
Did we achieve our goals?

32:42.480 --> 32:43.030
correct

32:43.590 --> 32:44.480
make sense

32:46.110 --> 32:46.680
Not very good

32:47.110 --> 32:48.070
Take these fifty taels

32:48.750 --> 32:49.510
Change it to one hundred taels

32:49.960 --> 32:50.680
This is better

32:57.750 --> 32:58.590
Very refreshing

32:59.000 --> 33:00.270
There is indeed someone now

33:00.350 --> 33:01.640
Are you saying you pay for information?

33:01.830 --> 33:02.960
He also gave the main characters

33:03.000 --> 33:03.680
This is a very high reward

33:03.920 --> 33:04.590
Is this really fake?

33:04.880 --> 33:05.920
The notice is posted throughout the city

33:06.480 --> 33:07.350
This is probably not a joke, right?

33:07.590 --> 33:08.160
Probably not

33:08.790 --> 33:09.350
Probably not

33:09.440 --> 33:10.590
This meal is poisonous

33:10.790 --> 33:11.640
I just heard

33:11.830 --> 33:13.110
I just don't know who the murderer is

33:13.310 --> 33:13.790
pity

33:13.830 --> 33:15.400
You don't know, I know

33:15.590 --> 33:16.400
I will get the reward now

33:17.550 --> 33:17.830
I'm coming too

33:17.830 --> 33:18.550
wait for me wait for me

33:18.640 --> 33:19.680
So I can have it too

33:20.790 --> 33:21.400
wait for me wait for me

33:21.440 --> 33:21.920
One hundred taels

33:22.310 --> 33:23.270
go! go! go

33:25.750 --> 33:27.920
Shopkeeper Zhang often encounters strange things

33:28.070 --> 33:29.000
molar

33:29.350 --> 33:30.720
Complaining that you took away his business

33:31.750 --> 33:33.640
The noodle shop next door talks about your Malatang

33:33.750 --> 33:35.070
Not as delicious as their noodles

33:36.160 --> 33:36.790
several days ago

33:37.000 --> 33:38.680
He saw a tall man

33:38.920 --> 33:40.400
he stands on the wall

33:42.510 --> 33:42.960
Thanks

33:43.400 --> 33:44.160
Remember when the time comes

33:44.200 --> 33:45.000
tell me something

33:45.480 --> 33:46.000
Next

33:46.070 --> 33:47.270
I don't have time to claim the reward.

33:48.920 --> 33:49.550
you know

33:49.790 --> 33:51.030
Who hurt our restaurants?

33:51.310 --> 33:51.830
nature

33:52.200 --> 33:53.240
i really saw it

33:53.640 --> 33:54.400
Very good and very fast

33:54.510 --> 33:55.110
Say it quickly

33:55.480 --> 33:56.070
i saw someone

33:56.070 --> 33:57.160
I drugged your food

33:58.160 --> 33:59.310
When and where were you?

33:59.830 --> 34:00.830
That day

34:01.030 --> 34:01.680
Promote your food

34:01.750 --> 34:03.030
The day before eating someone else's stomach

34:03.320 --> 34:03.960
i saw someone

34:04.150 --> 34:05.230
In the back alley of your kitchen

34:05.920 --> 34:07.070
maybe i take it with me

34:07.280 --> 34:07.920
That's a big bag of medicine, right?

34:08.510 --> 34:09.280
this is a big bag

34:09.480 --> 34:10.000
then from you

34:10.070 --> 34:11.030
Enter from the back door of the kitchen

34:11.190 --> 34:11.800
This is the medicine I gave you

34:12.150 --> 34:13.110
So who is this person?

34:13.630 --> 34:14.320
What is the body shape like?

34:14.360 --> 34:15.070
What is it like?

34:15.960 --> 34:16.360
man

34:16.840 --> 34:18.550
Approximate height

34:19.070 --> 34:19.630
Is it that high?

34:20.480 --> 34:21.440
Then

34:21.840 --> 34:22.590
The face is too big

34:22.840 --> 34:23.280
So the president

34:23.320 --> 34:24.030
And a beard

34:24.670 --> 34:25.150
It's dark

34:25.360 --> 34:26.360
I didn't see clearly either

34:26.920 --> 34:27.510
but i swear

34:27.920 --> 34:29.400
I've really seen this guy

34:29.800 --> 34:30.920
At first glance, this person is not a good person.

34:31.630 --> 34:32.110
That makes sense

34:32.190 --> 34:32.800
we must have this

34:32.800 --> 34:33.400
keep good records

34:33.630 --> 34:34.110
Record

34:35.190 --> 34:36.880
Can I get a bonus?

34:39.000 --> 34:40.110
maybe not now

34:40.590 --> 34:41.840
But wait until we catch someone

34:42.110 --> 34:43.440
Send money to your home as soon as possible

34:43.880 --> 34:44.710
So let's talk about this first

34:45.190 --> 34:46.000
the person you caught

34:46.190 --> 34:46.840
follow me

34:46.880 --> 34:48.630
This is almost the same as described

34:48.840 --> 34:49.550
All credit must go to me.

34:49.630 --> 34:50.190
All right

34:50.920 --> 34:52.280
May I have your name

34:52.280 --> 34:52.760
Where do you live?

34:52.760 --> 34:53.800
Mr. Dong's back alley

34:53.920 --> 34:54.440
all

34:56.960 --> 34:57.510
Manier

34:58.000 --> 34:58.800
These people were not found

34:58.800 --> 34:59.880
Is this all a lie to you?

35:00.400 --> 35:01.150
they don't know at all

35:01.230 --> 35:02.360
Who hurt our restaurant?

35:02.590 --> 35:03.880
Just to cheat the bonus

35:04.150 --> 35:04.800
I know

35:05.110 --> 35:06.630
Then let's waste this time

35:06.880 --> 35:07.190
look behind you

35:07.360 --> 35:08.400
There are many people queuing up

35:09.110 --> 35:10.280
maybe in your eyes

35:10.920 --> 35:11.710
i am a victim

35:13.230 --> 35:14.320
But in the eyes of others

35:17.070 --> 35:18.230
Have you heard of bonuses?

35:19.110 --> 35:19.920
Can you not know?

35:20.280 --> 35:21.030
when he comes

35:21.440 --> 35:23.030
I've seen a lot of people report bonuses.

35:23.280 --> 35:24.230
This is the queue

35:24.800 --> 35:26.110
Invest large amounts of money to offer bonuses

35:26.550 --> 35:27.280
her restaurant

35:27.440 --> 35:28.710
No matter how good the previous works are

35:29.030 --> 35:30.230
Can you make that much money?

35:30.630 --> 35:32.190
She is doing everything she can to lose all her money.

35:32.590 --> 35:33.670
We must also root out those behind the scenes

35:33.670 --> 35:34.360
catch them

35:34.710 --> 35:35.480
so

35:35.960 --> 35:37.150
Really framed

35:37.590 --> 35:39.440
I think it's possible

35:40.150 --> 35:41.280
I said if this is her food

35:41.360 --> 35:42.230
If it's really poisonous

35:42.630 --> 35:43.670
Can she have this confidence?

35:43.960 --> 35:44.800
Can you spend a lot of money?

35:44.800 --> 35:45.510
Are you here to reward me?

35:46.030 --> 35:47.360
What's the matter, young lady?

35:51.840 --> 35:53.960
Awang, right?

35:54.150 --> 35:55.400
Why did we all leave it?

35:55.510 --> 35:56.320
Why are you asking him?

35:56.840 --> 35:57.800
please keep your voice down

35:59.150 --> 36:00.150
He is very greedy for money

36:00.960 --> 36:01.670
if he saw

36:01.710 --> 36:03.030
Leanne Manier's bonus

36:03.840 --> 36:04.510
grandfather

36:04.760 --> 36:05.840
What should I do if he cheats on me?

36:07.070 --> 36:08.800
if he leaves

36:09.150 --> 36:10.280
You should no longer see the reward.

36:14.440 --> 36:14.880
No

36:16.550 --> 36:17.960
You still have to take me to his house

36:18.840 --> 36:19.670
I have to see it with my own eyes

36:19.670 --> 36:21.070
You really left Jinyang Province

36:21.190 --> 36:21.840
i feel very comfortable

36:22.440 --> 36:22.920
OK

36:25.230 --> 36:26.880
Okay, okay, keep doing your job.

36:45.150 --> 36:46.000
some people are skeptical

36:46.190 --> 36:47.760
The guy selling steamed buns is right at the door

36:48.110 --> 36:49.630
Firewood is often stolen from restaurants

36:50.150 --> 36:50.840
No wonder

36:50.880 --> 36:51.920
Recently we have firewood in the store

36:51.920 --> 36:52.840
Very fast to use

36:53.510 --> 36:55.070
It turns out someone benefited from it

36:55.320 --> 36:55.590
look

36:55.960 --> 36:57.400
This second brother reports to Li Laosan

36:57.800 --> 36:59.150
He secretly drugged us in our store.

36:59.440 --> 37:00.030
There is another one

37:00.550 --> 37:01.920
Li Laosan reports on Zhang Laoer's situation

37:02.110 --> 37:03.150
Secretly drugged our store

37:03.400 --> 37:04.150
How is this going

37:04.710 --> 37:06.150
So who gave the medicine?

37:07.360 --> 37:08.320
dog eat dog

37:15.070 --> 37:15.710
Reply to this credit

37:15.800 --> 37:16.630
Not small indeed

37:17.630 --> 37:18.510
The response is not small

37:18.800 --> 37:19.800
But it's no use

37:21.110 --> 37:21.800
of course not

37:22.670 --> 37:24.360
This notification helps a lot

37:25.760 --> 37:26.400
What was found?

37:28.280 --> 37:28.710
correct

37:29.440 --> 37:31.070
I've been staring at her these days

37:31.320 --> 37:32.190
Nga Wang, a courtier of the Song Dynasty

37:33.800 --> 37:36.070
hot cake

37:36.760 --> 37:37.280
Come two

37:37.590 --> 37:38.440
All right

37:40.880 --> 37:41.320
Come

37:41.880 --> 37:42.440
Credit first

37:43.150 --> 37:44.000
Awang, what's wrong?

37:44.550 --> 37:45.840
I lost again and even lost my underwear.

37:46.920 --> 37:49.400
Hot selling buns Selling buns

37:49.510 --> 37:52.440
Fresh hot cakes

37:53.480 --> 37:54.630
This Ngawang is a gambler

37:55.440 --> 37:56.190
he does this

37:56.630 --> 37:57.920
All just to get money to pay off debts

38:02.760 --> 38:04.550
Know that I lost the bet

38:04.760 --> 38:05.710
shortage of silver

38:06.030 --> 38:07.440
You came here specifically to give me money.

38:08.710 --> 38:10.150
Once your reward notification is sent

38:10.880 --> 38:11.840
Today I pay attention to Awang

38:12.360 --> 38:13.550
There is a new discovery

38:15.070 --> 38:15.760
but

38:16.320 --> 38:17.630
Leanne Manier's bonus

38:17.840 --> 38:18.960
But that's not all

38:19.280 --> 38:20.960
you are too greedy

38:21.280 --> 38:21.840
forward

38:21.840 --> 38:22.760
I gave you some money

38:22.800 --> 38:23.920
Let you leave Jinyang County

38:24.230 --> 38:25.320
Forget it if you don’t leave

38:25.550 --> 38:26.590
Now I'll give you another sum of money

38:26.800 --> 38:27.670
you think this is not enough

38:27.960 --> 38:29.630
if you're really passionate about it

38:30.030 --> 38:31.550
Let's go talk to the government.

38:33.440 --> 38:34.230
I was given medication

38:34.630 --> 38:34.920
mention

38:34.920 --> 38:35.760
What's in it for you?

38:36.190 --> 38:36.880
Talking without logic

38:37.590 --> 38:39.360
Madam, please nod to me again.

38:39.800 --> 38:40.760
if you don't give

38:41.320 --> 38:42.800
I will expose this

38:43.440 --> 38:45.320
The government rewards me with prison meals every day

38:45.550 --> 38:46.710
I'm not too worried

38:47.510 --> 38:49.280
Madam, I'm afraid you won't be used to it.

38:53.670 --> 38:54.800
It turns out they really are flowers.

38:55.510 --> 38:56.510
unacceptable

38:56.800 --> 38:58.190
Let’s take Awang to meet the officials.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
Such a gangster

39:00.510 --> 39:01.320
before the government

39:01.510 --> 39:02.510
