00:49.430 --> 00:50.200
Is it possible?

00:51.030 --> 00:52.030
he was buried

00:54.640 --> 00:55.520
I don't play

00:55.790 --> 00:57.470
I don’t want to play anymore, I don’t want to play anymore.

00:57.600 --> 00:58.480
I don't play this

00:58.790 --> 01:00.280
I don't play anymore

01:00.710 --> 01:01.680
Let me go

01:02.430 --> 01:03.950
please let me go

01:04.120 --> 01:05.590
Very hot, very hot, very hot, very hot

01:08.840 --> 01:10.310
I don't play anymore

01:20.710 --> 01:21.950
What about the agricultural system you're talking about?

01:22.350 --> 01:23.150
Tian didn't look at her

01:23.760 --> 01:24.789
As soon as I entered, someone chased me.

01:25.120 --> 01:25.870
he will be burned to death

01:26.400 --> 01:28.310
There was something wrong with the system just now

01:28.510 --> 01:29.480
Each delivery time

01:29.590 --> 01:30.310
Inaccurate

01:30.680 --> 01:31.640
Let's fix the equipment

01:32.310 --> 01:32.870
OK

01:33.070 --> 01:33.680
restart

01:34.000 --> 01:35.039
Less anxiety, less anxiety. Less anxiety, less anxiety.

01:37.280 --> 01:37.870
let me tell you

01:38.400 --> 01:39.479
You are in testing phase

01:39.560 --> 01:40.509
The first batch of experienced

01:40.870 --> 01:41.789
After completing the task

01:41.920 --> 01:42.759
Not only can you get rewards

01:42.950 --> 01:44.640
It can also contribute to game development

01:45.120 --> 01:45.759
Here it is this time

01:46.280 --> 01:47.680
Only execute people

01:48.200 --> 01:48.950
i don't think you are

01:48.950 --> 01:49.920
Game experience

01:50.840 --> 01:51.840
I want to send people away

01:53.229 --> 01:54.120
if you come again

01:54.310 --> 01:55.070
can you

01:55.789 --> 01:56.229
pain

01:56.789 --> 01:57.560
Lower it a little

01:58.150 --> 01:58.680
no problem

01:59.350 --> 02:00.480
But I must remind you

02:01.000 --> 02:02.310
Relatives are a stumbling block

02:02.520 --> 02:03.800
You have to go through what you have to go through.

02:04.400 --> 02:05.120
something similar

02:05.360 --> 02:07.000
After you receive the in-game mission and download it,

02:09.560 --> 02:10.470
He said it fifty times

02:11.520 --> 02:12.080
grandfather

02:12.280 --> 02:13.910
Your grandson called you

02:14.400 --> 02:15.630
I'll go out and take a call

02:18.150 --> 02:19.520
Made a lot of phone calls

02:19.630 --> 02:20.680
What is urgent?

02:21.000 --> 02:21.430
Mother

02:21.870 --> 02:23.590
The school will soon start collecting tuition fees

02:24.030 --> 02:25.470
Why don't you ask your father?

02:26.110 --> 02:27.120
My father said money is tight

02:27.240 --> 02:27.910
let me ask you

02:28.750 --> 02:29.910
Your sister is taking piano lessons

02:29.910 --> 02:31.240
spent a lot of money

02:31.590 --> 02:33.310
Your Uncle Li is not in good health

02:33.750 --> 02:35.190
Food, nutritional supplements and pharmaceuticals

02:35.400 --> 02:36.430
This costs a lot of money

02:37.000 --> 02:38.150
After your father and I broke up

02:38.430 --> 02:39.400
I have always been responsible for you

02:39.750 --> 02:40.630
I really tried my best

02:41.710 --> 02:42.310
ask your father

02:42.750 --> 02:43.630
go tell your father

02:44.310 --> 02:45.240
You are already a sophomore

02:45.840 --> 02:46.840
He paid tuition for two more years

02:46.840 --> 02:47.680
you can be free

02:48.190 --> 02:49.520
There is no need to be stingy to save this little money.

02:49.680 --> 02:51.190
but my mother

04:17.510 --> 04:18.630
The second eldest brother is here too

04:27.160 --> 04:27.800
Ryan Manner

04:29.040 --> 04:31.160
Didn't your mother tell you to choose vegetables?

04:31.430 --> 04:32.680
How dare you be lazy here

04:36.750 --> 04:37.750
sister in law

04:39.360 --> 04:41.600
Who is lazy in the pigsty?

04:43.630 --> 04:44.270
leave me alone

04:47.480 --> 04:48.800
This non-player character is very contrived

05:01.310 --> 05:01.870
elder sister

05:08.680 --> 05:10.040
this looks real

05:16.750 --> 05:18.000
so cute

05:52.040 --> 05:54.510
Where do you pour it?

05:56.630 --> 05:57.360
second wife

05:58.360 --> 05:59.510
Did you steal the eggs?

05:59.830 --> 06:00.480
Mother

06:00.830 --> 06:02.190
Don't blame me for being wrong

06:02.430 --> 06:04.040
I've been working all morning

06:04.430 --> 06:06.480
How can I have time to steal your treasure?

06:07.240 --> 06:08.270
Yeah yeah yeah

06:08.600 --> 06:09.160
Yes

06:09.600 --> 06:10.430
Come and help me

06:11.160 --> 06:11.630
sweep the floor

06:11.680 --> 06:12.240
this old lady

06:12.240 --> 06:13.390
Why do you keep touching chicken butts?

06:14.000 --> 06:15.190
How many eggs can a hen lay?

06:15.480 --> 06:16.240
a precise touch

06:16.270 --> 06:17.040
I said

06:17.800 --> 06:18.560
What not to do?

06:18.950 --> 06:20.040
No matter what you eat, there will be nothing left.

06:20.190 --> 06:21.600
You do not work

06:21.830 --> 06:22.830
Do you take a walk around here?

06:23.870 --> 06:24.720
are you still there?

06:25.830 --> 06:27.240
Long teeth and short hands

06:27.510 --> 06:28.480
goodbye

06:31.680 --> 06:32.600
Why did you run?

06:32.600 --> 06:33.720
Why did you hit someone?

06:33.870 --> 06:34.750
Why not boil water when cooking?

06:34.920 --> 06:36.120
go away

06:37.830 --> 06:38.720
third daughter-in-law

06:39.310 --> 06:40.270
Is this you

06:40.800 --> 06:41.950
I took my eggs

06:42.830 --> 06:43.360
Mother

06:43.870 --> 06:44.750
What did you say?

06:45.920 --> 06:47.360
I observe carefully every day

06:47.830 --> 06:48.750
Touch chicken butt in the morning

06:48.800 --> 06:50.120
Exactly five

06:50.190 --> 06:51.870
I just picked up four.

06:52.040 --> 06:52.830
If no one takes this

06:52.830 --> 06:53.800
How can it be less?

06:54.870 --> 06:55.560
say something

06:57.000 --> 06:57.680
Mother

06:58.360 --> 06:59.360
I didn't steal her father.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.630
What happened to my mother?

07:02.070 --> 07:03.190
Just in time for your return

07:03.560 --> 07:05.070
Your wife is good enough

07:05.680 --> 07:07.040
If you say a few words, she won't be happy.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.040
look like this

07:08.800 --> 07:09.480
Mother

07:09.800 --> 07:11.870
The family has been together for many years

07:12.360 --> 07:14.070
you must have a clear mind

07:14.190 --> 07:15.000
your daughter-in-law

07:15.070 --> 07:16.120
She doesn't look like that person

07:18.000 --> 07:21.120
You really raised a good son

07:21.190 --> 07:22.750
How dare you take a wife

07:23.120 --> 07:25.560
Just say I am immortal

07:26.310 --> 07:28.160
Jing said I'm not

07:28.720 --> 07:30.560
Thank you for such a big improvement

07:30.800 --> 07:32.560
How eye-opening?

07:33.190 --> 07:35.600
They are simply the descendants of disloyalty.

07:35.920 --> 07:36.480
Queen

07:36.870 --> 07:37.750
This is his son, isn't it?

07:38.040 --> 07:39.310
I said third brother and third sister

07:40.040 --> 07:41.560
Didn't I just eat an egg?

07:41.750 --> 07:42.920
Just admit it

07:43.070 --> 07:45.070
Mom, the most I can say is a few words from you.

07:46.120 --> 07:47.800
Second sister-in-law, me, me

07:48.040 --> 07:48.750
Yes

07:49.630 --> 07:50.510
Why not just eat an egg?

07:50.920 --> 07:51.720
Just admit it

07:52.270 --> 07:53.070
I admit

07:53.510 --> 07:54.159
Second aunt

08:03.680 --> 08:04.560
Yes

08:04.720 --> 08:05.430
Queen

08:06.600 --> 08:07.120
Mother

08:07.630 --> 08:08.630
Mom, listen to my explanation

08:08.630 --> 08:10.360
What are you doing here?

08:12.950 --> 08:13.920
Mom, you ran away again

09:39.720 --> 09:40.840
It really hurts

09:53.750 --> 09:55.720
Who are in this family?

09:59.870 --> 10:00.670
I've been here a long time

10:01.840 --> 10:03.080
Why haven't I seen the quest yet?

10:49.240 --> 10:50.510
it's a beautiful view

10:51.120 --> 10:51.910
Don’t take photos and post them on Moments

10:52.120 --> 10:52.910
Unfortunately

11:11.030 --> 11:14.080
Get one thousand taels of gold

11:16.510 --> 11:17.270
have no idea

11:17.840 --> 11:18.150
elder sister

11:18.150 --> 11:18.550
elder sister

11:20.750 --> 11:21.750
go home quickly

11:22.200 --> 11:22.960
I want to scold you

11:23.270 --> 11:25.000
Just scold her and leave her alone.

11:25.790 --> 11:26.790
checkout counter

11:28.870 --> 11:30.390
Can you see the words inside?

11:33.080 --> 11:33.510
seems to be just there

11:33.670 --> 11:34.670
I can see it myself

11:36.790 --> 11:37.670
Sister Xiaoqi asks you

11:38.200 --> 11:39.000
Here we have a choice

11:39.150 --> 11:40.030
how much does it cost?

11:40.670 --> 11:42.240
An option I didn't know about

11:42.600 --> 11:43.270
but I know

11:43.510 --> 11:44.910
Five articles about candied hawthorns

11:45.480 --> 11:46.360
this means

11:46.630 --> 11:47.600
an article in this world

11:47.790 --> 11:49.390
equivalent to a part of the real world

11:49.870 --> 11:51.320
One thousand taels of gold

11:51.670 --> 11:52.790
This is equivalent to ten thousand taels of silver

11:52.960 --> 11:54.270
One tael of silver is equal to one thousand penny.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.630
The total is ten million

12:02.440 --> 12:03.440
Ten million

12:05.000 --> 12:06.030
There are stains on my clothes

12:06.240 --> 12:06.840
Where do you want me to go?

12:07.000 --> 12:08.080
Go get 10 million

12:10.230 --> 12:11.440
Ten million

12:12.320 --> 12:13.320
Ten million

12:14.390 --> 12:15.390
Doesn't this embarrass me?

12:16.120 --> 12:16.720
elder sister

12:17.550 --> 12:18.550
Are you OK

12:19.670 --> 12:20.670
Ten million

12:32.910 --> 12:33.390
Sister Ye

12:34.080 --> 12:34.960
do you know

12:35.320 --> 12:37.320
How can I earn a thousand gold coins?

12:38.150 --> 12:39.030
One thousand gold

12:40.000 --> 12:40.790
you are crazy

12:41.360 --> 12:42.200
Don't say you made money

12:42.630 --> 12:43.720
We have dozens of lives

12:43.960 --> 12:45.630
I can't see that much money.

12:48.670 --> 12:49.910
How many acres does your family own?

13:49.240 --> 13:50.480
The cupboard must be opened to put milk in

13:52.550 --> 13:53.080
What's wrong

13:53.670 --> 13:54.550
Only uncle's family

13:54.750 --> 13:55.510
Back from the city

13:55.840 --> 13:57.080
Only girls can open lockers

13:58.270 --> 13:59.000
Have a child

14:09.150 --> 14:09.790
Yes

14:10.000 --> 14:12.080
Come on, I'm hungry

14:35.670 --> 14:36.480
large fat meat

14:38.480 --> 14:40.790
Fatty meat tastes better

14:47.790 --> 14:48.270
one slice

14:50.510 --> 14:51.550
two slices

14:53.630 --> 14:54.750
three slices

14:56.720 --> 14:57.510
four slices

14:59.480 --> 15:00.200
five slices

15:00.840 --> 15:02.910
During the Chinese New Year, I only cut four slices.

15:03.510 --> 15:04.440
six pieces

15:07.720 --> 15:08.240
seven slices

15:12.630 --> 15:13.510
eight slices

15:40.150 --> 15:41.120
almost

15:48.270 --> 15:48.870
Mother

15:49.840 --> 15:50.510
Let's give it to Manier

15:50.720 --> 15:51.790
This is what I call marriage

15:52.150 --> 15:53.390
Nothing can go wrong, right?

15:54.030 --> 15:55.440
After all, they are a family

15:55.790 --> 15:57.150
But take it easy

15:57.600 --> 15:58.600
this is marriage

15:58.960 --> 16:00.270
this is your grandmother

16:00.600 --> 16:01.720
and three uncles and three aunts

16:02.030 --> 16:03.320
Everyone nods

16:07.200 --> 16:08.080
child's father

16:09.440 --> 16:10.200
her dad

16:12.240 --> 16:13.080
what are you saying?

16:16.790 --> 16:17.750
if

16:18.510 --> 16:20.550
Your second uncle is sneaky

16:21.120 --> 16:22.840
complications may occur

16:24.150 --> 16:24.910
Your third uncle

16:25.600 --> 16:26.470
honest family

16:27.630 --> 16:28.510
No need to worry at all

16:30.960 --> 16:33.120
You see, your father said so

16:33.790 --> 16:34.600
Wait for tomorrow

16:34.960 --> 16:36.600
The matchmaker picks up the man

16:37.080 --> 16:38.320
That's five hundred taels of silver

16:39.120 --> 16:40.200
I just got it

16:42.550 --> 16:43.480
i got the money

16:43.960 --> 16:45.150
And Lian's family

16:47.000 --> 16:47.790
unless

16:48.550 --> 16:49.360
Only when the flowers bloom can things go well

16:49.600 --> 16:50.240
He married well

16:51.150 --> 16:52.200
I can make a formal donation

16:52.720 --> 16:54.030
the day i took office

16:54.630 --> 16:55.720
This is our family, Lian

16:56.000 --> 16:56.840
The good times have arrived

16:58.240 --> 16:58.960
Yes

16:59.350 --> 17:00.160
remember them all

17:00.750 --> 17:01.830
in front of grandma

17:02.550 --> 17:03.880
No one is allowed to reveal even a word

17:04.720 --> 17:05.829
Dad, look

17:06.160 --> 17:08.160
This is good wine

17:08.440 --> 17:09.510
white pear

17:10.720 --> 17:12.270
this would be better

17:12.589 --> 17:13.829
This is a great snack

17:14.000 --> 17:15.109
Calling for scent

17:15.750 --> 17:16.920
governmental agents

17:17.200 --> 17:18.750
I like this one better

17:19.160 --> 17:20.640
I'll bring it back for you to try

17:22.720 --> 17:24.240
Please introduce yourself

17:24.270 --> 17:25.829
It would be great if this person could come back

17:26.109 --> 17:27.510
I always bring a lot of stuff

17:28.030 --> 17:29.400
This is not a waste of money.

17:29.680 --> 17:30.510
I don't spend money

17:30.720 --> 17:31.680
No money

17:32.550 --> 17:34.000
This might be a gift from someone else

17:34.790 --> 17:36.000
Son, how have you been these past few years?

17:36.830 --> 17:38.640
Bad luck, often failing exams

17:38.880 --> 17:39.400
but

17:39.590 --> 17:41.440
After all, I am knowledgeable.

17:41.750 --> 17:42.750
I'm preparing for the exam

17:43.000 --> 17:44.070
While in private school

17:44.310 --> 17:45.240
classroom teaching

17:45.680 --> 17:46.790
students treat me

17:47.310 --> 17:48.790
Like very much

17:49.680 --> 17:50.200
dad

17:51.720 --> 17:52.920
Are you still busy in the fields?

17:54.440 --> 17:56.550
It's been easy these days

17:57.640 --> 18:00.920
I'll be busy with the autumn harvest in a few days

18:02.440 --> 18:03.030
dad

18:03.440 --> 18:04.550
I put all the firewood in the backyard

18:05.750 --> 18:06.590
Don't tell her here

18:06.790 --> 18:07.720
dinner is ready

18:08.000 --> 18:08.590
tasty food

18:08.830 --> 18:09.640
All right

18:09.880 --> 18:10.310
Come

18:10.920 --> 18:11.960
eat eat eat

18:13.960 --> 18:14.550
Come and give

18:15.000 --> 18:16.480
pour on top

18:19.480 --> 18:21.110
Tree kernels, eat more

18:22.110 --> 18:22.680
all

18:51.240 --> 18:51.720
pour wine

18:52.200 --> 18:52.790
Sher

18:53.440 --> 18:54.270
Look what you are wearing

18:54.480 --> 18:55.200
gold plated hairpin

18:55.680 --> 18:56.480
so hot

18:57.550 --> 18:58.480
This hairpin

18:58.720 --> 19:00.070
Flowers are always reluctant to wear

19:00.200 --> 19:01.350
I have to leave it to you

19:02.640 --> 19:03.790
Come to the flowers

19:04.310 --> 19:06.160
This fat meat is very aromatic and delicious.

19:39.110 --> 19:39.790
eat more

19:50.240 --> 19:51.030
this is for you

19:51.960 --> 19:53.440
What are you chewing in your mouth?

19:54.830 --> 19:55.400
meat

19:56.880 --> 19:57.550
take a look

19:57.720 --> 19:59.000
This is the good daughter I raised

19:59.550 --> 20:00.640
Born from the ghost of greed

20:01.590 --> 20:02.920
The meat is stuffed in piece by piece

20:03.720 --> 20:04.750
Don't think I can't see it

20:04.750 --> 20:06.510
This little thought of yours

20:06.790 --> 20:08.160
I don’t even know how to eat meat myself

20:08.480 --> 20:09.240
stop making noise

20:09.550 --> 20:10.350
It’s not easy to cultivate people

20:10.510 --> 20:11.030
counting

20:11.240 --> 20:12.550
You have meat for your children to eat

20:13.480 --> 20:13.920
This meat

20:14.200 --> 20:16.000
I can't bear to take a bite

20:16.480 --> 20:17.200
What do you mean by this man?

20:17.350 --> 20:18.720
Are you trying to be rude?

20:20.310 --> 20:21.200
Can be eaten by two people

20:21.830 --> 20:22.750
Why can't I eat?

20:23.480 --> 20:24.440
I gave him flowers

20:24.830 --> 20:25.720
Why do you eat it?

20:27.270 --> 20:28.830
I washed seven eggplants

20:29.350 --> 20:30.070
eight cabbage

20:30.200 --> 20:31.240
twenty-nine long beans

20:31.640 --> 20:32.240
why should i

20:32.830 --> 20:35.000
you damn girl

20:35.680 --> 20:36.920
You thought you were going to marry a rich man

20:37.110 --> 20:38.510
Your waist is stiff, isn't it?

20:38.720 --> 20:39.880
repeatedly

20:39.880 --> 20:41.200
Are you contradicting your elders?

20:41.310 --> 20:43.030
Look at the good daughter you raised

20:44.750 --> 20:45.680
I am married

20:47.960 --> 20:48.750
Manier

20:49.480 --> 20:50.160
you say you

20:50.790 --> 20:51.790
I will follow you soon

20:51.790 --> 20:53.200
The young master of the Sun family is married

20:53.510 --> 20:55.030
Such a popular person will eat spicy food from now on

20:55.110 --> 20:56.070
Days of wearing gold and silver

20:56.240 --> 20:57.000
Can it be any less than this?

20:57.510 --> 20:58.590
Why don't I live at my parents' house?

20:58.880 --> 20:59.880
for a piece of meat

21:00.240 --> 21:01.350
Are you angry with grandma?

21:01.640 --> 21:02.270
Then it

21:03.590 --> 21:04.480
Sun family

21:11.750 --> 21:12.680
That is, the Sun family

21:14.400 --> 21:14.920
Sun Li

21:15.480 --> 21:16.000
Yes

21:16.400 --> 21:17.200
you know too

21:17.510 --> 21:18.400
This Sun family is from our local area

21:18.590 --> 21:19.480
great escort

21:20.270 --> 21:20.880
Manier

21:21.240 --> 21:22.310
What a great day for you

21:22.640 --> 21:23.590
What's behind?

21:25.720 --> 21:27.030
Why is this Sun family here again?

21:27.830 --> 21:29.680
If you get married, you may end up buried.

21:31.750 --> 21:32.480
I won't get married

21:36.510 --> 21:37.070
nothing to say

21:37.590 --> 21:38.680
Marriage is a big deal

21:39.240 --> 21:39.880
this is a big thing

21:40.590 --> 21:43.160
As a beginner you have to decide

21:43.680 --> 21:45.510
I want to marry you, not you

21:46.160 --> 21:47.310
Why can't I make a decision?

21:48.240 --> 21:48.830
Third brother

21:49.400 --> 21:50.030
this marriage

21:50.200 --> 21:51.270
I begged someone

21:51.640 --> 21:53.400
I just want to save face

21:53.960 --> 21:55.640
After searching here and there, I finally found the Sun family.

21:55.960 --> 21:57.200
What a wonderful family

21:57.640 --> 21:58.720
first is my father

21:59.030 --> 22:00.000
And you

22:00.510 --> 22:01.590
But they are all exaggerated.

22:01.960 --> 22:02.440
tomorrow

22:02.880 --> 22:04.070
The matchmaker came to pick me up.

22:04.720 --> 22:05.550
Just back and forth like this

22:05.960 --> 22:07.550
How should I face others?

22:07.680 --> 22:09.510
Where should my face be?

22:10.880 --> 22:12.480
rich young man

22:12.750 --> 22:14.750
Why do you have to be so impatient?

22:14.750 --> 22:16.200
Marry me a country girl

22:18.270 --> 22:19.200
Twists and turns in the middle

22:19.350 --> 22:20.030
Who do you know?

22:20.440 --> 22:21.000
perhaps

22:21.790 --> 22:22.830
Drag me to bury

22:24.680 --> 22:25.440
Manier

22:26.150 --> 22:28.030
I don't dare talk to my uncle like this

22:30.310 --> 22:31.030
Manier

22:31.550 --> 22:33.160
Look, you're worried, aren't you?

22:33.510 --> 22:35.350
Then why does the Sun family love you?

22:35.550 --> 22:36.830
Isn’t it because you live a good life?

22:37.440 --> 22:38.960
These horoscopes are very similar to Mr. Sun’s predictions

22:39.160 --> 22:40.400
This is a perfect match

22:41.480 --> 22:42.270
This woman?

22:42.590 --> 22:44.310
Sooner or later, you will get married.

22:44.920 --> 22:46.160
If I could marry into the Sun family

22:46.440 --> 22:46.920
this

22:47.070 --> 22:48.720
opportunity of a lifetime

22:48.880 --> 22:50.070
Wouldn't it be a pity to miss it?

22:50.310 --> 22:51.160
my aunt

22:51.960 --> 22:52.830
Such a good marriage

22:53.480 --> 22:54.830
It's time for Sister Hua'er to get married.

22:55.000 --> 22:55.590
you

22:57.110 --> 22:58.830
What stupid thing did you say?

22:59.240 --> 23:00.160
Your sister Wile

23:00.510 --> 23:02.200
Didn’t you recognize the Song family a long time ago?

23:02.680 --> 23:04.000
No boss at work

23:04.790 --> 23:05.680
this is a good thing

23:06.000 --> 23:07.590
Can it fall on your head?

23:08.440 --> 23:09.960
This is a wealthy family

23:10.310 --> 23:11.960
You are still very picky

23:12.240 --> 23:13.110
Is this possible in the future?

23:13.350 --> 23:14.880
I want to marry Uncle Guoguo

23:15.750 --> 23:17.400
You really don't know what's wrong with you

23:18.680 --> 23:19.270
Sanal

23:19.880 --> 23:21.400
what do you think?

23:24.750 --> 23:27.110
Although the marriage has been decided

23:27.680 --> 23:28.830
But look at Mannar's situation

23:29.510 --> 23:31.000
I really don't want to get married

23:32.920 --> 23:33.920
Fortunately, the Sun family

23:34.310 --> 23:35.440
Haven't picked up Man'er yet

23:36.480 --> 23:37.680
With a family like the Sun family

23:38.240 --> 23:39.480
Find people who match your zodiac sign

23:39.790 --> 23:40.750
It's not hard to be afraid

23:41.590 --> 23:42.110
Big brother

23:45.200 --> 23:45.830
Mother

23:46.960 --> 23:47.640
Mother

23:49.590 --> 23:52.480
What crime did our family commit?

23:53.070 --> 23:53.550
successively

23:53.750 --> 23:55.440
Leave the good old times behind

23:55.790 --> 23:57.640
What a waste of time

23:58.030 --> 24:00.160
Thank you President

24:00.310 --> 24:02.270
all this is for you

24:02.720 --> 24:03.550
But you are like this

24:03.750 --> 24:05.160
Embarrassed in front of the president

24:05.680 --> 24:08.440
You are such a heartless thing

24:09.960 --> 24:10.480
Mother

24:10.590 --> 24:11.000
Mother

24:11.110 --> 24:11.510
Mother

24:11.960 --> 24:12.590
Mother

24:13.070 --> 24:13.880
look

24:14.240 --> 24:15.110
this is a good thing

24:15.400 --> 24:16.590
When you say you're falling, you're falling

24:16.750 --> 24:18.110
Look how girly you are

24:24.750 --> 24:26.350
I won't get married, I won't get married

24:26.550 --> 24:28.720
I won't get married

24:29.310 --> 24:30.440
Who wants to force me to get married again?

24:30.720 --> 24:32.590
I'll jump into the well

24:32.750 --> 24:33.550
I won't get married

24:33.830 --> 24:35.960
let her jump

24:36.070 --> 24:37.680
Manier doesn't want to get married

24:37.880 --> 24:39.310
I was trying to force her to die.

24:39.830 --> 24:40.920
Why is he like this?

24:41.590 --> 24:42.720
wilderness

24:43.160 --> 24:45.160
If you don't dance, you marry me

24:45.680 --> 24:47.240
Do you dare to bring Joe to me?

24:51.880 --> 24:52.350
Yes

24:52.920 --> 24:53.640
I'd like to see

24:54.240 --> 24:55.110
you and your family

24:55.310 --> 24:56.830
Word spread of forced marriages and the sale of girls.

24:57.440 --> 24:58.550
Do you make people laugh?

24:59.480 --> 25:00.110
who stopped her

25:00.400 --> 25:02.110
I will cook meat for anyone who can stop her.

25:03.790 --> 25:04.960
I am coming

25:09.680 --> 25:10.920
Manier, don't do anything stupid.

25:11.200 --> 25:11.790
child

25:11.960 --> 25:12.720
don't come here

25:13.000 --> 25:13.830
Come here and I'll jump down

25:14.070 --> 25:14.590
you can't come

25:14.590 --> 25:15.240
I still have to eat meat

25:15.400 --> 25:16.110
You, don't come here

25:16.270 --> 25:16.790
come over

25:17.160 --> 25:18.400
Manil, don't jump.

25:22.030 --> 25:22.680
do not come

25:24.550 --> 25:25.310
Manier

25:26.960 --> 25:28.200
Why are you unlucky?

25:28.750 --> 25:29.880
He was burned to death for the last time

25:30.160 --> 25:32.750
I don't think this drowning will be comfortable either.

25:34.070 --> 25:34.750
Manier

25:43.400 --> 25:44.000
Manier

25:44.790 --> 25:45.440
Manier

25:47.400 --> 25:48.070
Manier

25:53.350 --> 25:55.270
hold mom's hand tightly

25:55.350 --> 25:56.350
hurry up

25:57.240 --> 25:58.240
Manier

26:13.790 --> 26:14.640
Manier

26:15.440 --> 26:17.720
Manil Manil Manil

26:19.030 --> 26:19.790
Manier

26:25.310 --> 26:26.150
Manier

26:30.510 --> 26:32.110
You can't do stupid things anymore

26:51.680 --> 26:52.160
Mother

26:54.480 --> 26:55.200
Do you mean Munir?

26:55.200 --> 26:56.350
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

26:59.200 --> 27:00.000
don't worry too much

27:00.720 --> 27:02.160
nothing will happen

27:02.590 --> 27:03.680
Waiting for the matchmaker to arrive tomorrow

27:03.880 --> 27:04.720
i picked it up

27:05.440 --> 27:07.550
That's how he decided

27:11.830 --> 27:12.590
mom, tell me

27:13.350 --> 27:13.880
How did Mannar know?

27:14.070 --> 27:15.310
She married into the Sun family

27:20.400 --> 27:21.960
I won't go I won't

27:21.960 --> 27:22.680
walk to

27:22.680 --> 27:23.550
I don't

27:23.590 --> 27:24.110
he goes

27:24.110 --> 27:25.000
I don't

27:27.790 --> 27:28.510
Serve

27:31.590 --> 27:32.720
let me out

27:33.200 --> 27:34.310
let me out

27:53.070 --> 27:55.270
you can't hurt me

27:57.160 --> 27:58.240
Who dares to force me again?

27:59.160 --> 28:01.160
I'll put ginger juice on his face

28:06.350 --> 28:07.000
from

28:11.110 --> 28:11.790
from?

28:24.920 --> 28:25.720
Xiao Qi

28:33.400 --> 28:34.720
Well, a few times.

28:35.200 --> 28:36.480
Sister follow me

28:37.160 --> 28:37.590
For what purpose?

28:37.880 --> 28:38.400
My sister won't get married

28:38.510 --> 28:40.000
I will protect my sister from now on

28:42.030 --> 28:42.590
Lovely

28:47.000 --> 28:47.790
Go quickly

28:56.440 --> 28:57.160
Manier

29:00.110 --> 29:00.750
Manier

29:02.480 --> 29:02.960
Manier

29:03.480 --> 29:04.070
Xiao Qi

29:04.680 --> 29:05.790
Why are you hiding here?

29:06.960 --> 29:08.510
He put a wood seal on me

29:11.310 --> 29:11.830
Manier

29:12.550 --> 29:13.510
Quick baggage claim

29:13.920 --> 29:15.400
Go hide at your uncle's house for a few days

29:16.270 --> 29:16.830
Go quickly

29:24.590 --> 29:25.350
Being a mother means nothing

29:26.310 --> 29:27.550
failed to protect you

29:28.510 --> 29:29.270
these years

29:29.880 --> 29:31.790
Mom is responsible for everything at home

29:32.400 --> 29:34.310
But now this marriage

29:34.790 --> 29:36.440
This is related to your life's happiness

29:37.350 --> 29:39.070
Mom, I can never go on like this.

29:41.440 --> 29:42.160
Let's go now

29:42.960 --> 29:43.510
quickly

29:44.200 --> 29:44.680
he goes

29:55.110 --> 29:56.240
If grandma knew

29:57.440 --> 29:58.790
Just say I will go by myself

30:02.400 --> 30:03.680
Be careful on the road

30:26.880 --> 30:28.350
good agricultural system

30:28.920 --> 30:30.720
I have yet to winnow down the best set of relatives.

30:31.960 --> 30:33.240
What bastard prepared this?

30:34.350 --> 30:35.440
Let me go find my uncle

30:35.960 --> 30:36.550
no one told me

30:36.720 --> 30:37.590
Where is my uncle?

30:44.350 --> 30:44.830
rhubarb

30:45.240 --> 30:46.070
run, run, run

30:47.440 --> 30:48.400
How did you get here?

30:49.350 --> 30:50.680
How long have you been following?

30:51.790 --> 30:53.350
What a wonderful dog.

30:53.640 --> 30:54.110
let's go

30:54.590 --> 30:55.030
he goes

30:55.480 --> 30:56.160
here

31:35.440 --> 31:37.030
You, you are porcelain

31:37.240 --> 31:38.310
No technical content at all

31:38.480 --> 31:39.720
I'm eight feet away from you

31:50.030 --> 31:51.200
Is it a system?

31:51.400 --> 31:52.550
The rhythm of kicking your friends out from the start

31:54.480 --> 31:55.200
unnecessary

31:59.240 --> 32:00.310
Why did you faint?

32:02.880 --> 32:04.240
Possibly hypoglycemia

32:10.550 --> 32:11.550
strange and mysterious

32:11.720 --> 32:12.440
non-player character

32:13.070 --> 32:13.830
If after saving

32:14.350 --> 32:15.830
What hidden plot was touched upon?

32:16.110 --> 32:16.960
that would be annoying

32:18.480 --> 32:19.750
I still have to run for my life

32:21.480 --> 32:22.440
Sorry brother

32:51.070 --> 32:52.240
I don't believe it anymore

32:57.920 --> 32:58.880
Can you still play like this?

33:06.720 --> 33:10.880
are you still there

33:14.160 --> 33:14.790
beautiful

33:16.720 --> 33:17.590
Although I have never done this

33:19.510 --> 33:20.920
But the basic knowledge is still there

33:42.070 --> 33:43.480
What’s wrong with you?

34:02.710 --> 34:03.710
do what do do what do do

34:03.960 --> 34:05.150
How to do how to do

34:09.280 --> 34:10.280
I need to make bigger moves.

34:11.440 --> 34:12.070
rhubarb

34:20.880 --> 34:21.320
hurt

34:37.320 --> 34:38.360
what are you going to do

34:45.760 --> 34:46.800
I just woke you up

34:47.550 --> 34:49.000
Raise your hands and squeeze my neck

34:49.320 --> 34:50.150
repay kindness with hatred

34:55.710 --> 34:56.550
you just want to save me

34:57.670 --> 34:58.280
if not

35:00.320 --> 35:00.880
You do not understand

35:01.710 --> 35:02.480
Since you are the protagonist

35:03.670 --> 35:04.400
There must be a way to help me

35:07.880 --> 35:08.550
let me ask you a question

35:09.670 --> 35:10.190
my uncle

35:10.840 --> 35:11.840
They want to sell me and bury me

35:13.000 --> 35:13.800
what should I do

35:14.550 --> 35:15.480
bury people alive

35:16.320 --> 35:17.110
Contempt for human life

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
According to the law, the perpetrators must be executed

35:19.670 --> 35:20.920
The accomplices were exiled three thousand miles away

35:21.320 --> 35:22.480
Who dares to do this to you?

35:23.280 --> 35:24.070
Just notify the administrator

35:29.920 --> 35:30.590
I thought you had

35:30.590 --> 35:31.760
What is a good idea?

35:33.320 --> 35:35.480
But I have no basis for this

35:35.920 --> 35:37.920
It was useless for me to report this to the authorities.

35:40.360 --> 35:40.880
people from government

35:40.880 --> 35:41.880
You must be looking for me everywhere

35:43.030 --> 35:43.960
maybe you can seize this opportunity

35:44.840 --> 35:45.480
change identity

35:46.070 --> 35:47.280
This way we can find Thirteen as soon as possible

35:52.230 --> 35:53.070
maybe i can help you

35:55.670 --> 35:56.510
If you have something to say, it's best to say it directly.

36:04.630 --> 36:05.590
I'm tired

36:06.920 --> 36:08.000
How can I find it?

36:08.710 --> 36:09.480
this is a stupid errand

36:09.630 --> 36:10.880
Where can I easily find it?

36:11.630 --> 36:13.070
There are a lot of bandits these days

36:13.710 --> 36:14.960
Could he have been robbed?

36:15.510 --> 36:17.510
Yes, let's look for it tomorrow.

36:17.840 --> 36:18.550
Look how tiring this is

36:18.550 --> 36:19.230
my waist

36:20.150 --> 36:21.030
are you tired?

36:22.070 --> 36:23.400
How can this be good?

36:24.920 --> 36:25.840
hydrated rice

36:26.190 --> 36:26.710
That king is a matchmaker

36:26.920 --> 36:28.480
I will choose someone tomorrow

36:28.590 --> 36:29.840
Anyway, today should be

36:29.840 --> 36:30.960
We have to find Manir again

36:35.110 --> 36:35.760
Is this you

36:35.760 --> 36:37.400
Let the dead girl escape

36:38.280 --> 36:39.030
Yes or no

36:42.070 --> 36:43.110
He said

36:50.150 --> 36:50.920
Yes

36:51.710 --> 36:53.880
It's really you, loser.

36:54.400 --> 36:55.670
If you want to kneel, kneel

36:56.150 --> 36:56.960
Even that damn girl

36:57.000 --> 36:57.550
Before return trip

36:57.840 --> 36:58.510
all kneel down

37:18.230 --> 37:18.800
Manier

37:19.360 --> 37:20.800
What noise is there in the middle of the night?

37:21.630 --> 37:22.280
Ryan Manner

37:23.000 --> 37:23.760
you didn't run away

37:24.840 --> 37:25.630
Where can I escape to?

37:26.230 --> 37:27.000
I can't sleep in the shed

37:27.030 --> 37:28.150
Just lie somewhere else

37:29.590 --> 37:30.510
Big belly

37:30.630 --> 37:31.630
Why are you always kneeling?

37:32.000 --> 37:32.710
granny track

37:33.150 --> 37:34.480
How embarrassing that would be

37:37.880 --> 37:38.400
how

37:39.440 --> 37:39.960
all

37:40.590 --> 37:41.510
This baby is good

37:41.760 --> 37:42.510
I feel relieved now

37:43.590 --> 37:44.880
Let's all go home and rest.

37:53.190 --> 37:55.280
you are an overlooked thing

37:56.030 --> 37:57.400
Sleep like a dead pig

37:57.800 --> 37:58.760
Are you squeaking?

37:58.760 --> 38:00.230
empress, empress

38:00.360 --> 38:01.920
It’s hard for big men to come to you

38:03.000 --> 38:03.960
Do not be angry

38:04.400 --> 38:05.480
What’s wrong with you?

38:06.070 --> 38:07.230
Don't worry, I won't leave

38:08.030 --> 38:08.840
I have a better way

38:09.440 --> 38:10.550
Fuck this marriage

38:11.920 --> 38:12.480
let's go

38:20.400 --> 38:21.840
a set of hairy shoulders

38:22.400 --> 38:24.150
lazy bastard man

38:24.440 --> 38:26.110
The sun hits my ass

38:26.400 --> 38:27.800
Why aren't you awake yet?

38:27.960 --> 38:29.070
I wish I had done that

38:29.360 --> 38:30.630
daughter in law

38:30.880 --> 38:33.030
This is not suitable yet

38:33.360 --> 38:34.480
elder sister

38:34.920 --> 38:35.590
Get up quickly

38:36.000 --> 38:37.190
Nai was scolded outside

38:37.480 --> 38:38.510
elder sister

38:41.070 --> 38:42.280
Where is the phone?

38:45.440 --> 38:46.150
no mobile phone

38:46.190 --> 38:47.550
Days without air conditioning

38:51.030 --> 38:52.400
Not human at all

38:54.190 --> 38:55.110
what time is it

38:55.800 --> 38:56.400
When will that be?

38:56.800 --> 38:57.590
sesh

38:59.590 --> 39:01.590
Purple Bamboo Silver Mao Qin

39:02.630 --> 39:03.510
sesh

39:05.760 --> 39:06.840
That time has passed

39:07.480 --> 39:08.510
Why hasn't that person come yet?

39:08.630 --> 39:09.920
I am coming

39:10.150 --> 39:11.320
Please enter quickly

39:11.840 --> 39:12.960
hydrated rice

39:13.440 --> 39:14.880
The matchmaker is here

39:15.280 --> 39:17.000
Mom and dad, please go out quickly.

39:19.230 --> 39:20.280
Then there's the acting.

39:25.150 --> 39:25.880
Manier

39:27.000 --> 39:27.710
Manier

39:33.550 --> 39:34.230
patient

39:34.360 --> 39:35.230
Take it easy

39:36.440 --> 39:36.960
host

39:37.960 --> 39:38.550
grandmother

39:39.760 --> 39:40.550
Granddaughter is disobedient

39:41.400 --> 39:43.150
I had a cold a few days ago

39:43.960 --> 39:46.030
I thought it would be fine in a few days

39:47.800 --> 39:48.550
I have no expectations

39:49.030 --> 39:50.070
Very serious

39:51.110 --> 39:52.510
I'm worried I won't be so lucky

39:52.960 --> 39:54.150
Marry into the Sun family

39:59.710 --> 40:01.320
This is not an incurable disease

40:01.710 --> 40:02.360
It doesn't matter

40:03.000 --> 40:03.960
Wait until we arrive at Sun's house

40:04.190 --> 40:05.000
The Sun family will definitely meet

40:05.030 --> 40:07.000
Ask the best doctor to see you

40:07.400 --> 40:08.360
maybe another day

40:08.510 --> 40:10.280
Medicine can cure diseases

40:15.710 --> 40:17.000
That's great

40:18.360 --> 40:19.000
but

40:19.670 --> 40:20.510
if it's not good

40:21.110 --> 40:22.190
The Sun family said

40:22.710 --> 40:23.550
We will keep in touch

40:24.070 --> 40:25.510
Throw the disease vaccine to others

40:26.070 --> 40:26.800
Which

40:27.400 --> 40:29.480
This will not only bring shame to the family

40:30.320 --> 40:32.400
It will also ruin the uncle's reputation.

40:36.630 --> 40:37.710
Manier is right

40:38.590 --> 40:40.320
Now the girl is very sick

40:40.670 --> 40:41.510
marriage is important

40:41.670 --> 40:42.960
If not, then take your time.

40:43.670 --> 40:44.400
dad

40:44.670 --> 40:45.280
dad

40:46.480 --> 40:47.840
my son believes

40:48.230 --> 40:49.110
this is karma

40:49.440 --> 40:50.480
even if you stay at home

40:50.840 --> 40:51.880
The most we can do is

40:52.110 --> 40:53.960
Find a doctor to take a look

40:54.280 --> 40:55.030
All that's left is

40:55.190 --> 40:56.000
resign yourself to fate

40:56.590 --> 40:58.150
The Sun family is very wealthy.

40:58.360 --> 40:59.280
If you go to Sun's house

40:59.800 --> 41:01.590
You will definitely get better care

41:04.440 --> 41:04.960
Manier

41:05.670 --> 41:06.480
Manier

41:07.110 --> 41:07.800
Manier

41:08.320 --> 41:10.280
The Sun family is far away from our village

41:10.760 --> 41:12.070
Manier is very ill

41:12.510 --> 41:13.920
I'm afraid I can't stand the torture of the road.

41:14.360 --> 41:15.070
behind

41:15.400 --> 41:17.190
Who among us doesn’t have a headache or a fever?

41:17.840 --> 41:18.880
How could she be so sensitive?

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
grandma is right

41:22.230 --> 41:23.550
How could she be so sensitive?

41:26.070 --> 41:26.840
host

41:27.800 --> 41:29.000
now that i agree

41:29.800 --> 41:30.670
That's it anyway

41:31.710 --> 41:32.630
I have to go

41:34.190 --> 41:35.800
Even if you die on the road

41:36.800 --> 41:38.760
This is also the fate of my granddaughter

41:40.030 --> 41:40.630
just afraid

41:41.880 --> 41:43.230
Granddaughter is here

41:45.800 --> 41:47.230
impossible

41:48.960 --> 41:51.070
goodbye

41:53.480 --> 41:54.960
grandfather

41:59.960 --> 42:00.630
Manier

42:02.480 --> 42:03.150
Manier

42:11.030 --> 42:12.110
in this case

42:14.230 --> 42:15.400
Is it from Ye Shuren?

42:19.150 --> 42:20.320
Good, good, good, good

42:20.670 --> 42:21.550
Hurry up

42:22.150 --> 42:24.550
Walk around and blah blah blah.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.030
I have something else to say

42:26.030 --> 42:26.750
I have something else to say

42:26.960 --> 42:28.230
Etc., etc

42:28.480 --> 42:29.510
Wait until I have more to say

42:29.630 --> 42:30.230
I have something else to say

42:30.280 --> 42:31.150
she feels uncomfortable

42:31.440 --> 42:32.400
Manier

42:34.550 --> 42:35.480
Is Leanne Manner home?

42:44.630 --> 42:46.280
You must be Mr. Lian, right?

42:47.030 --> 42:47.760
I'm very polite

42:49.110 --> 42:50.190
Who are you

42:52.800 --> 42:53.710
Leanne Mannier's husband

42:54.920 --> 42:55.630
this child

42:56.400 --> 42:56.800
dad

43:16.150 --> 43:16.880
this child

43:18.800 --> 43:19.670
This is indeed a way

43:20.070 --> 43:20.840
impossible

43:21.230 --> 43:22.670
Manier didn't even move from the door.

43:23.230 --> 43:24.550
Where did such a brat come from?

43:25.550 --> 43:27.000
where do you come from?

43:27.360 --> 43:28.110
you are not like that

43:28.190 --> 43:29.760
Will it ruin our family's reputation?

43:31.150 --> 43:32.880
My home is located in Shengya Village, Qingshan District

43:33.320 --> 43:34.550
Three years ago, I followed my father and brother

43:34.670 --> 43:35.670
Rush to Lotus City

43:36.630 --> 43:37.840
Later I passed by here

43:38.230 --> 43:39.630
Falling in love at first sight with Maner

43:40.440 --> 43:41.800
Later we often met alone

43:42.440 --> 43:43.630
This is not a vigilant move

43:44.030 --> 43:44.880
She is pregnant

43:45.670 --> 43:46.880
Xinnuo

43:48.000 --> 43:49.670
Manier, you are finally here

43:51.320 --> 43:52.400
Does it look like this?

43:53.070 --> 43:53.920
this is not your fault

43:54.590 --> 43:55.070
Commitment time

43:55.230 --> 43:56.110
Why did you come now?

43:56.880 --> 43:57.400
look

43:58.550 --> 43:59.670
I took our kids with me

44:00.710 --> 44:01.150
Come

44:01.630 --> 44:02.320
our

44:04.070 --> 44:05.030
us
