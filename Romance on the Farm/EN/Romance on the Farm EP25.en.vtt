WEBVTT

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.560
Ahhhhhhh

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.640
ah

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.120
Um

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.720
Um

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.080
Uh-huh

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.400
Um

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.800
go to hell

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.040
Shameless

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.160
Get out of here, mom

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.120
yeah

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.320
Zhao Liyun

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.160
What?

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.200
Break it open for us

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.560
Don't leave a single hole in the tiger's mouth, right?

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.120
sorry

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.280
I'm late

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.840
I'm sorry

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.400
If I hadn't gone to the mine and been arrested,

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.720
You got away long ago

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.400
Is this right?

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.360
This is the evidence I've been looking for

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.240
It's you who have been helping me

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.360
cooperative therapy

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.480
he is serious

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.200
Are you OK

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.560
I once promised you

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.800
we want to stay together

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.440
Soon a lifetime or a day

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.960
Even if it's just a few hours

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.760
did not expect

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.760
Now it can't be fulfilled

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.640
Woods Road

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.760
Get them all for me

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.080
Don't stop him

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.640
kill my brother

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.000
I want to marry you today. Spare your life.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.880
Are you okay?

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.200
Goodes is here

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.520
Take it easy

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.760
Otherwise, shoot without mercy

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:19.600
Get hurt

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.200
if i die

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.080
Even if you know the location of the mine

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.920
without me as witness

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.280
You still can't win Ninghou

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.400
You thought it helped your wish

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.320
He can help you achieve your great goals

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.120
Stop dreaming

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.680
You are just a little wife

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.960
Anyone without four orders

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.360
Still working for him

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.400
How long has it been and I’m still obsessed with it?

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.360
What do you know

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.120
I have also

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.280
Ten years of cold window

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.120
I once embraced Buddha in my heart

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:06.760
I also wanted to have a fist fight in the court hall

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.200
But what about the result?

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.720
involved in partisanship

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.320
Slandered

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.240
Like a bereaved dog left in the wilderness

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.080
If the Marquis hadn't come to his aid,

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.520
I am already a body in the wilderness now

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.360
Bone Wolf

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.480
so

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.000
Even Hou will turn this whole world upside down

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.200
I will definitely do it too

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.400
go all out

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.840
no matter what

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.680
Stop kidding yourself

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.400
From the time Mr. Lin started to capture Boss Cao,

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.040
He already knew

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.960
Mining is just exposure

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.960
To destroy the human staff

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.760
The beauty of your waking up

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.480
Cleaning up the portal has already started

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.440
you

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.360
All must die

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.520
impossible

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.480
possible

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.040
Mr. Hou and I

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.080
It's a life-long acquaintance

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.960
I know all his plans

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.480
He will not give up Jin Yangxin easily

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.640
won't give up on me easily

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.640
Liu Fugui’s facts are a warning

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.360
He just

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
I want to remove your hand from me

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.680
Understand what I mean

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.120
you are next

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:35.960
you

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.040
Desperate

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.120
No

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.320
i will die

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.920
Mr. Hou will not treat me like this

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.480
He will definitely keep me loyal

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.120
Don't talk nonsense

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:35.960
Wu Shaolin

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.200
you are in darkness

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.000
Although the world in your eyes is also dark

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:43.480
but

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.800
you have lost

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.480
walk

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.240
make

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.000
sure

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:28.320
The wind blows and blows through the strong wind

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.720
Is there anyone?

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.840
I want I want

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.400
A few more trips

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.200
I would rather Hou Chao Chao Gang

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.440
Form a party and rebel

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.760
Ye has been thrown into the sky prison by Qin

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.360
However, the fishing party still exists

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.640
unforgivable sin

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.720
Kill with all your strength

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.320
Jinyang County Magistrate is vacant

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.880
I personally appoint nosy matters

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.000
Soon the blade will be used

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.600
I have many people here

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.360
Jinyang County is raging due to rebellion against the party

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.360
causing the people to suffer

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.880
Minru Town

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.400
I am very informed

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.400
Now we are exempt from taxes in Jinyang County for three years.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.520
Return grain fields to the people

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.360
Build water conservancy

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.960
Revitalize farming

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.440
Go to the prosperity of Jingyang

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.000
Keep the people safe and happy

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.320
A piece of white separation

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.280
Hey, your family is back too

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.080
Why don't you come back early?

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.520
This is bleeding

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.120
It's better to live at home

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:45.640
After you finish cleaning up, why don’t you go to my house to eat Bole?

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.600
Hey, daddy, come and make peace with me

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:31.560
right

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.640
Order it up

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.440
None of this golden nest is as good as my own doghouse

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.560
It's better to go home

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.440
Oh no

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.720
I used to curse people and said

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:52.040
When I get rich in the future, I will go to the town to get a house.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.440
If you ask me, our old home is pretty good.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.400
Although dull

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.680
But my heart is always at peace

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:01.880
yes

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.040
Yo three younger brothers and sisters

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.240
Second brother and second sister-in-law

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:07.760
This is back

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.080
It's the elbow made by Mai Restaurant today.

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.080
This is closed

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:13.120
We were afraid that it would be a pity, so we brought him back.

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.120
Let’s eat together in a while

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.960
Hey, we just got back and we still have some work to do.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.720
It will pass in a while

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.280
You said it would be nice if nephew Shen Nuo was here

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:24.400
You can leave all these jobs to him.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.880
It's better to pull him down than to be a 13-year-old nephew.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:27.880
I'm scrambling to do any job.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:28.840
thanks, thanks

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.200
The third child

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.040
When can Shen Nuo and the others come back?

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:37.400
Hey hey

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.520
Not to mention, I really miss them.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.560
Thanks to Shen Nuo, the entire camp was saved.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.360
Only then can we move back safely

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.720
Oh, you said you have never seen such a battle when you were so old?

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:52.280
Haha, I didn’t expect him to be a court official.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.720
Big brother, I have to do it when he sees me

00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.880
Yes, yes, come on, chase the elbow

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.000
Ha ha

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.160
After a while, my sister is done with her work and I will come to your room. Hey, OK.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:18.320
thank you

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.000
mom

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.800
Has Shen Nuo sent you a message?

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.200
No

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.200
Count the days and come back soon

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.880
I don’t know if he and 13 have recovered from their injuries.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.200
Have you taken your medicine on time?

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.760
How are things going?

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.040
You tell me this 800 times a day

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.520
You forgot where I am now

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.440
Aren't I worried?

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.440
It would be bad if the root of the disease is left behind.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.320
You said they have been gone for so long

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.240
Why don't you want to come back?

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.880
13. I don’t want to stay in Beijing.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:03.240
Marry a 456-room house and never come back, right?

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.760
If he said he would come back, he would definitely come back.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:07.560
don’t worry

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.440
I kiss you

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.240
I'll pack it up and go back to rest. Call me if you need anything.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.040
Um

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.320
Dad, don’t go now

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.760
Oh, don't worry about it. Oh, daddy.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.120
father

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.480
It's okay. Your second aunt will give you some elbows.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.080
Go and eat

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.000
Let's go, mother

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:55.680
What's going on

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:57.200
Why

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.400
Ever since your aunt came here

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.120
He and your uncle have no opposite sex.

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.960
I don’t know where he went.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.920
Your grandfather goes out looking for people every day

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.040
Your father advised you not to go looking for him

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.320
He went without listening

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:14.080
Why

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:26.760
daughter

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.440
what happened

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:29.600
Didn't sleep so late

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.720
I don't want to have sex with your father

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.440
It's like he's possessed

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:37.280
If you don't have a home in the cold weather, you'll know how to find the boss.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.600
What's going on? Give it to me this late at night.

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.480
Why are you here in such a hurry?

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:45.960
That's not it

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.920
The person who joined forces is his son, aren't you two?

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.760
I want to show

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.400
Being harmed like that by that boss

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.680
It's like sticking a needle into my heart

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.120
ah

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.000
Your father is good

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.240
I have to get the person back

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.080
In fact, I can’t show off myself

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.480
You can show off whatever I made.

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.120
grandmother

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.280
You have been with grandpa for so many years

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.640
Don’t know him yet

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:25.120
If I can't find my uncle

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.120
He definitely won't give up

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.440
What if something happens to the uncle?

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.400
He must feel guilty for the rest of his life

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.120
Could it be

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.760
You two are going to be at odds with each other for the rest of your life.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:41.680
Moreover

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:44.800
I think it’s not just grandpa who wants to find his uncle at home.

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:49.640
My second uncle, my father, is a member of a large family.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.160
Talking about opportunities

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.440
In fact, I miss my uncle in my heart.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.360
It was this big brother who ended up in this situation

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.240
He must have suffered a lot

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.120
Um

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.560
It’s almost the New Year now

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:08.480
The uncle's family is still outside

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:12.320
What do you think the family members can do in their hearts?

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.200
I don't care if you look for him

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.800
But who will bully me again?

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:22.480
If Xiu and Xiu can't get along, it won't work.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.240
look

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.760
It's okay dad

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:36.480
grandmother

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.040
It’s just that I’m still holding back my energy.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:41.240
In fact, he is also very worried about his uncle

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.520
That being said

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.440
Oops, no one can persuade you now

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.120
or

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.560
Let's go out and look for it tomorrow.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:56.280
At least know the situation of uncle's family first

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.480
OK

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:01.800
Listen to you

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.280
Oh, I'm confused

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.120
Mom is confused

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:22.600
Oops

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:42.600
What's wrong with you?

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.080
Still angry with dad?

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.560
Ah, are you hungry?

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.920
Eat, eat quickly

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:51.680
Why

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:02.560
daughter

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.080
Actually I thought about it for a long time

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.840
If I hadn't been attracted by Liu Fugui

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.200
Big brother won’t suffer like this either

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.080
The eldest brother was forced into desperation by Liu Fugui

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.840
If I hadn't married

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:19.320
He is probably not going to die.

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.200
In fact, I have already thought about it

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.560
What kind of empress is destined to be rich and noble?

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.200
It's all a lie to oneself

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:31.840
Count it to the end

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.440
Still suffered the crime that I least wanted to suffer

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.280
I no longer blame my elder brother in my heart.

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.120
Mom, don’t complain

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.280
But you have suffered so much

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:52.640
Mom can’t get over this hurdle in her heart.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.480
I know you feel sorry for your brother

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.120
Feel sorry for me too

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.480
It's just that both sides are in a dilemma over this matter.

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:07.120
Now my eldest brother is also driven crazy

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.000
Mom and Dad must feel uncomfortable

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:15.760
If the eldest brother, father and mother can’t untie their hearts,

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.880
Then my whole life

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:20.880
That's why I can't live a peaceful life

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.560
Mother

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.960
I hope we can all start over

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:42.640
Let this be bygones be bygones

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.080
ah

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:04.160
Bring this pancake to your father quickly.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.520
Madam, have you seen that person?

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.280
What, have you seen this person?

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.360
This is not the joint housing department. He used to live here.

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.320
Not seen recently

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:55.920
How is the craftsmanship?

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:56.960
Did you find it?

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.720
Not found, not found

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.800
What are you doing? Don't look for it.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.080
Oh My God

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:04.840
Official

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:08.040
Have you ever been here before?

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.800
How many times have you been here?

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:13.520
No, no, do you know where he went?

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.800
Oops, I don’t know. Hurry up. Hurry up.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.720
Have you seen this person? This one?

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.440
Never seen it before, no, it's okay

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.800
have you seen this person

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:37.720
Have you ever seen this person?

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.240
Well you haven't seen it

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.000
give it to me

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.800
Sister-in-law, why are you here?

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.520
I didn’t want to find my elder brother.

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:49.840
But you are too stupid

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.520
I haven't found it after searching for so long.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:54.440
I just couldn't stand it anymore, so I decided to help you.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.320
Then it's up to you

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:01.560
So ugly

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.280
Go find Brother Ugly

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.880
Hey, Master, have you seen this person?

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.240
no apology

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:15.000
Brother, have you seen this person?

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.880
Why don't you take a rest earlier, dad?

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.520
It's almost dawn

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.640
Well, you go and have a rest. I'll paint a few more pictures.

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.440
I'll be with you

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:39.080
Have you seen this person?

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.320
Ah, never seen it

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:44.200
Thank you very much. Have you met this person?

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.200
Never seen this

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.320
Thank you, Sister Yan. How about it?

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:51.480
I didn’t go and take a look, okay okay?

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.760
Searched all over this town

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.920
Where did the uncle go?

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:03.760
Let's look for it tomorrow

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:06.560
I'll go to another town tomorrow and ask.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.400
This is 13

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:17.040
13

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:22.360
yeah

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:23.560
yeah

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:36.920
let me see

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:42.280
Why did you come back?

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.920
I thought you weren't coming back. Why did you come back?

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.400
Idiot, stop crying

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.160
Mal girl

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.320
Where is Shen Nuo?

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:17.960
13 In these days when you are not around

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:21.360
We and the people in the village have all moved back

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.120
And our family decided to get my uncle back

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.720
I just went to town with Ma Er to find my uncle.

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.480
Yan'er

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.680
I have a few words to say to Ma

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:39.240
Okay, then shall I wait for you at home?

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:48.840
Mal Gui ah

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.560
The husband is troubled by the public

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:53.440
So it’s forgetfulness

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.600
May not be able to come back

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.920
The promised date

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.280
ah

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.000
After the death of Yu Anhou

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.080
Chaos in the DPRK

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.560
Lang Jun, when the zombies haven’t recovered yet

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:10.080
Just start becoming a member of the party

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:11.600
He really can't get away

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.280
Don't misunderstand me, I know

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:15.960
I understand

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.280
Ah yes

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000
This is what he asked me to forward to you.

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.240
This madman

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.400
It's for ghosts

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.160
Then did he tell you?

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:38.960
When exactly will he come back?

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.960
Go find Sister Yan quickly

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.480
When you were away, he talked to me about you every day

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.720
Miss you

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:02.520
Then how about you, um, and I go for a walk alone?

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.960
Okay, then I'll go back first

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.320
Mal

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.960
A word is separated by several years

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.480
The two places are mysterious

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.760
Very concerned

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.000
Today I am in the countryside

00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.920
Look up and see the stars

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.320
Enjoy this view alone

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.640
Frequent sweating

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:06.480
The horse came down from the court just now

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.000
Rice fields are everywhere

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.280
I miss you sweetly

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:15.120
Whip-Smash Pony

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.640
Minghuan Benxiao

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.960
See you someday

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.800
I will control your hand

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.120
to wait for my wishes

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.920
Everyone is tolerant

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.280
It should be me

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.240
originally thought

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.080
See you again

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.040
I have to go now

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.280
Have you seen this person before?

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:21.440
Have you seen this person?

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.040
Have you seen this person?

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.840
Chasing the past is empty

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.160
talk

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:45.960
worry

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.760
chasing after

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.880
strands of hair

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:01.960
Third shift dentist

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.680
Seating on both sides

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.320
The madman hit someone

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:07.960
A madman is beating someone. A madman is beating someone.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:10.040
Go, go, go, go, go

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:14.760
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:17.480
Let's go to the folk holy place to go to the snow.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:20.840
Where have you been? Where have you been?

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.880
Looking for you

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.040
who are you

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:28.360
I don’t recognize you anymore

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.240
I am the Great Master Qingtian

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:33.800
imperial official

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:37.320
I want to see the mountain, I have a problem that I want to beat

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.000
Sir, let’s go home today

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:43.040
When you get home, your whole family will come looking for you.

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.800
Let's go back, let's go back

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.200
elder

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.960
Where do you think this boss has gone?

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.360
Then the whole town was searched

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:04.200
If there is no letter at all

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:08.760
I'm going down to talk to you.

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.280
Then the guests are gone. What are you doing here?

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:14.040
Hey, I did the math.

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:16.120
If only I could give it to the restaurant again this month

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:17.680
How many heads should I pull?

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.440
Plus what we saved before

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:21.160
Find some space for me

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.600
You thought about it

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:24.720
Think about it

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:28.840
Oh, you said you haven't given Ye'er anything after all these years.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.240
Who can really take over that shop?

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:32.760
Ye'er, be a good-looking person

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.440
It would be worse to do something else

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.640
Just pretend it's good

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.800
Wait until that Bodhisattva is really enlightened.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.120
I'm going to do some chores for our daughter.

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:45.200
This side of Nawan

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.200
Just stay here by yourself

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:52.600
Wife ah ah ah ha ha ha ha

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:57.160
Hey, what are you doing? Mom has been gone all morning.

00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:58.960
Not a single letter is okay

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:00.720
Then take a break quickly.

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:02.680
I'll go with your second uncle in the afternoon.

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.920
Go up, go up, go up

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:09.000
Stop running

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:10.640
Who is it?

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.200
Who is this?

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.920
Hey, is this clearly dad’s voice?

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:21.360
Yes I heard it too

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:24.320
Go up, go up, go up

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:27.240
It's high tide. It's high tide.

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:28.840
Hello everyone, brother

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.440
Hey, a little bit

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:34.360
Where can I find Brother Yamen? Don’t be nagging and chase me.

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:35.960
pursue craftsmanship

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:39.080
Ah, chase, yes

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.520
What are you yelling about?

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.400
saint

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:48.720
ah

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:50.200
saint

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:55.040
The sound is not working anymore. It is not working anymore.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.000
Almost out of breath

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.360
Caught up immediately

00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:00.200
The eldest brother is so capable of running that he left first after a while.

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:02.000
Come and go

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:03.360
Walk

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:04.920
Walk

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.280
Go doctor doctor

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.200
Big sister, big sister

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:13.360
Big brother, big brother, you are quite healthy

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:14.520
You can also feel at ease

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:16.840
Then forget it, okay?

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:19.800
big brother big brother

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.280
Where has he gone?

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:27.680
Uncle

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:30.200
Uncle, can we stop running away?

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:31.680
Going to court

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:33.600
Going to court

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:41.000
Go up, go up, go back, go up, go up

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.600
Going to court

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:50.240
Uncle, do you live here?

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:53.520
Why does eldest brother live here in Shengtang?

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.280
Flower, your father is coming back

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:29.680
sister-in-law

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.640
Why are you here?

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.240
ah

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:51.920
Dad happened to meet my eldest brother at the Yamen Gate today.

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.760
We'll chase you all the way

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.400
otherwise

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:58.680
I didn’t know you were leading such a life

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:00.560
oops

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.760
It's freezing cold today

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:05.040
How do you survive the winter?

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:07.440
sister-in-law

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:11.480
Why do you live here?

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:24.920
Hai Long's eldest brother helps Wu Zhonglian do things

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:26.600
Although people are dead

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:27.880
Guilt is still inevitable

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:30.800
The Song family’s mansion and property

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:33.040
They were also confiscated by the government.

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.960
How many people have received the front

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:37.680
Fortunately, the Song family’s mistress said so

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.760
Hai Long is not his biological son

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:41.440
I'm not like his big brother

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:43.520
Did all those outrageous things

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:47.440
Only then did the government leave the sea dragon as a creature.

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:56.280
Look at your elder brother

00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:58.960
He's crazy

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:02.480
Naturally, I lost my official position.

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.160
We don't have any money

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.000
you say

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:09.200
where can we go

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.320
Now I can have this thin porridge to drink

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.280
Are you lucky?

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.840
All aunties are like this

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:29.720
Why don't you tell your family?

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:32.600
My mother asked you to help take care of her before.

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:33.760
when my dad

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:35.640
No one came to help

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.280
I'm back

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.080
Don't

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.480
Slow sister, second uncle and second aunt

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:55.880
Why are you here?

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.920
Don’t buy the borrowed medicine again.

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:09.440
Too much money

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:10.520
It doesn't matter

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:13.680
The doctor says it's possible to cure it, so let's cure it

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:24.320
We didn't know you would come

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:27.480
There is nothing to entertain at home.

00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:29.720
Sorry everyone

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.680
Hey, go, go, go, hey Bozi

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.040
What's the situation at your house?

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:38.600
Your mother-in-law just said it

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:43.240
What are your plans from now on?

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:46.720
I want to find a job

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:50.480
But now the people in the town

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:53.440
Everyone is afraid that I am from the Song family

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:55.000
No one dares to use me

00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:57.360
But it's okay

00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:00.200
I'm sure they'll forget about it soon.

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:01.840
By the time

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:04.200
I can make money to support my family

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:06.680
work

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:09.960
You can do it

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:12.480
What's wrong with this

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:17.000
For the flower daddy

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:19.720
I have to do it too, right?

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:27.040
go home

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:33.280
As long as I have something to eat

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:36.440
I can’t make you hungry

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:40.640
No

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:47.600
We are doing well now

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.440
It's not too early

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:52.560
You guys should go back early and rest.

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:54.440
flower

00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:57.120
Brother-in-law, let me have a few words with Sister Hua.

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:07.320
on

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.040
got a room

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:53.120
wine that becomes spring rain
