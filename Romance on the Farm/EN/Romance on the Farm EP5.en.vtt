[Episode 5]

01:38.979 --> 01:39.820
Mana is by my side

01:39.820 --> 01:40.539
no matter what the purpose is

01:40.710 --> 01:42.420
When you're done taking care of your business, leave quickly.

01:46.270 --> 01:47.360
What if you still want to stay with me?

01:52.100 --> 01:52.900
You're welcome

01:52.920 --> 01:53.560
I won't let you get hurt.

01:58.380 --> 01:59.180
I was joking

01:59.660 --> 02:00.620
take it easy

02:04.280 --> 02:04.850
suananga

02:09.100 --> 02:09.960
king

02:10.139 --> 02:11.220
Sua

02:11.240 --> 02:12.370
I won't even look at you

02:12.660 --> 02:14.190
He is like a lotus flower

02:14.220 --> 02:15.820
Because I want to marry into a rich family.

02:15.980 --> 02:16.500
you

02:16.530 --> 02:18.180
I'm not someone you can ignore

02:18.210 --> 02:19.220
wake up from dream

02:20.440 --> 02:21.440
i just need to know

02:23.060 --> 02:24.340
But what should I do?

02:24.480 --> 02:25.740
Who does Su Ah like?

02:25.800 --> 02:27.030
Because the other person doesn't like it

02:27.579 --> 02:28.470
every day

02:28.500 --> 02:29.260
find a man

02:29.579 --> 02:30.660
I have no choice but to go to town

02:31.660 --> 02:32.670
Stop talking nonsense

02:32.710 --> 02:33.510
Is it bullshit or not?

02:33.540 --> 02:34.870
you know best

02:35.290 --> 02:36.320
Tung Fu Inn

02:36.340 --> 02:36.800
This Confucius

02:36.829 --> 02:37.910
This is what I said to my brother.

02:38.680 --> 02:39.170
he is

02:39.220 --> 02:39.950
Arriving in front of this Confucius Mansion

02:39.980 --> 02:40.940
I'll go find it

02:40.980 --> 02:42.340
This Confucius didn't even look at me.

02:42.710 --> 02:44.600
I pretended to be arrogant and did all this alone.

02:44.630 --> 02:45.829
I do all sorts of things behind the scenes.

02:46.070 --> 02:47.310
Meanwhile, Yan Manya escapes.

02:47.340 --> 02:49.420
Are you saying you can't get married?

02:50.460 --> 02:51.680
Beside Yanmana

02:51.700 --> 02:52.740
surrounded by men

02:53.030 --> 02:53.710
but you...

02:54.860 --> 02:55.690
This is indeed a big deal

02:55.940 --> 02:57.710
We all come from the same family.

02:57.820 --> 02:58.590
Even ten thousand

02:58.820 --> 03:00.780
you look beautiful and smart

03:01.190 --> 03:02.450
Why is our show...

03:02.940 --> 03:03.570
ugly?

03:04.850 --> 03:05.380
ugly

03:06.070 --> 03:07.130
etc.

03:07.370 --> 03:08.210
Okay, I'll wait.

03:08.380 --> 03:08.980
He must be very angry

03:11.780 --> 03:12.540
I fell

03:14.980 --> 03:15.700
Auntie, please hold my hand.

03:16.890 --> 03:18.829
go away don't worry

03:20.520 --> 03:20.980
move

03:29.220 --> 03:31.380
Let's start the first month

03:35.700 --> 03:37.820
The moon is very bright tonight

03:38.500 --> 03:40.260
The wind is very cold

03:41.220 --> 03:42.540
The aura of the moon

03:43.340 --> 03:45.020
in the sky

03:45.680 --> 03:47.490
it comes with the wind

03:47.860 --> 03:49.640
it's a beautiful night

03:50.100 --> 03:52.230
countless stars

03:52.380 --> 03:54.150
light up the river

03:54.710 --> 03:56.500
beautiful moon

03:57.140 --> 03:58.950
it lights up the sky

03:59.660 --> 04:01.000
Clean as a mirror

04:01.650 --> 04:03.300
The weather is as cold as ice

04:04.220 --> 04:05.970
countless people

04:06.470 --> 04:08.510
I'm looking at the moon

04:09.270 --> 04:11.060
rare

04:11.700 --> 04:13.310
for this opportunity

04:14.060 --> 04:16.250
I'll try to be polite.

04:17.019 --> 04:19.540
thank god

04:44.100 --> 04:45.050
Let us bow to the moon

04:49.140 --> 04:50.020
let us kneel down

04:53.020 --> 04:53.780
wake up

04:57.030 --> 04:57.900
let us kneel down

05:01.450 --> 05:02.220
wake up

05:05.340 --> 05:06.630
Please bow your head

05:30.340 --> 05:31.090
rural activities

05:31.110 --> 05:31.990
It's interesting

05:49.580 --> 05:50.100
Thanks

06:22.940 --> 06:24.050
I say thank you

06:34.260 --> 06:34.980
come help me

06:47.140 --> 06:47.840
That's it, right?

06:52.900 --> 06:53.700
rice

06:53.900 --> 06:54.700
Eat so much

06:55.070 --> 06:56.350
Aren't you going to do your job well?

06:57.690 --> 06:58.800
put more

06:58.890 --> 06:59.540
Is it difficult?

07:05.340 --> 07:06.310
sacrificial fruit

07:06.330 --> 07:07.410
share with them

07:07.780 --> 07:08.220
Go to grandma's place

07:08.220 --> 07:09.710
Go get the fruit for ancestor worship.

07:09.900 --> 07:10.140
ruler

07:10.610 --> 07:12.210
take this mat away

07:13.060 --> 07:13.680
good harvest

07:14.960 --> 07:17.110
What if I touch the altar?

07:17.140 --> 07:17.860
Mother

07:18.410 --> 07:19.180
Mom, that's...

07:19.410 --> 07:20.140
The tone has not returned yet

07:20.140 --> 07:21.480
You can't eat too little food

07:21.570 --> 07:22.430
If I bring food to your room

07:22.460 --> 07:23.310
Do you want to stay?

07:23.540 --> 07:24.290
please give me a pomegranate

07:26.060 --> 07:26.900
thanks Mom.

07:27.380 --> 07:27.900
sochir

07:30.090 --> 07:30.450
Mother

07:32.010 --> 07:34.300
Could it be that this man was possessed by a ghost and starved to death?

07:34.510 --> 07:35.909
Is the moon really round today?

07:37.180 --> 07:37.659
Mother

07:42.960 --> 07:43.610
thanks Mom.

07:43.980 --> 07:44.550
I have to say hello to grandma

07:44.580 --> 07:45.170
thank you grandma

07:50.340 --> 07:50.980
thanks Mom.

07:51.010 --> 07:52.550
thank you grandma

07:58.820 --> 07:59.340
I have to say hello to grandma

08:01.940 --> 08:04.280
Maybe I like gluttons

08:12.530 --> 08:13.230
Mother

08:13.520 --> 08:14.470
your grandmother might

08:14.820 --> 08:16.380
You may still be angry about what happened last time.

08:17.580 --> 08:18.840
If you are angry, you can be angry.

08:19.540 --> 08:20.340
Just oranges

08:20.340 --> 08:20.970
Serve with some pomegranates

08:21.660 --> 08:23.220
Are you paying attention?

08:23.340 --> 08:24.220
That's the kind of person your grandmother was.

08:24.630 --> 08:25.310
let's go back

08:30.940 --> 08:31.820
Mom, please go back first.

08:34.220 --> 08:34.860
Aunt

08:36.500 --> 08:37.179
How is this going?

08:37.460 --> 08:38.620
Yanman baby

08:38.860 --> 08:39.610
When answering

08:39.630 --> 08:40.740
with many men

08:40.820 --> 08:41.650
I dance

08:41.970 --> 08:43.690
Yeonman-ah is a bad girl.

08:44.420 --> 08:46.060
he

08:46.210 --> 08:47.360
make fun of me

08:48.460 --> 08:49.440
when i have the chance

08:49.980 --> 08:51.340
I need to take a look

08:58.510 --> 08:59.590
You know, Auntie.

08:59.620 --> 09:00.220
come over

09:08.390 --> 09:09.670
is this real?

09:11.740 --> 09:12.180
Sweet?

09:12.250 --> 09:13.290
if you swallow the seeds

09:13.420 --> 09:14.590
Bean sprouts will grow in your stomach

09:15.490 --> 09:16.370
spit out seeds

09:16.740 --> 09:17.300
Spit it out

09:19.850 --> 09:20.340
grandmother

09:20.580 --> 09:20.820
Mother

09:21.060 --> 09:21.940
what are you doing here?

09:24.800 --> 09:25.270
Sua

09:26.940 --> 09:27.460
grandmother

09:30.460 --> 09:30.940
grandmother

09:32.410 --> 09:33.680
Mom, what are you doing now?

09:33.980 --> 09:34.940
Grandma, what are you looking for?

09:37.580 --> 09:38.090
Mother

09:38.280 --> 09:39.350
Mom, why are you like this?

09:39.850 --> 09:40.330
grandmother

09:40.740 --> 09:41.550
Why are you doing this?

09:41.580 --> 09:42.300
Mom, what are you doing?

09:42.320 --> 09:43.160
Grandma, why are you like this?

09:43.420 --> 09:43.850
grandmother

09:44.420 --> 09:44.880
Mother

09:44.900 --> 09:46.460
What if you took my money?

09:46.700 --> 09:48.580
This is the money you earned, give it to me.

09:49.050 --> 09:50.720
I haven't even moved out yet.

09:50.930 --> 09:52.380
Already hiding your emergency fund?

09:52.410 --> 09:53.250
Are you rebellious?

09:53.290 --> 09:54.020
Then let's break up.

09:54.670 --> 09:55.400
money i earn

09:55.570 --> 09:56.500
I can't give it to grandma.

09:57.660 --> 09:59.930
bad

10:00.010 --> 10:00.840
Do you want to expand your business?

10:01.340 --> 10:02.060
OK

10:02.280 --> 10:05.340
Kill me and your grandfather first.

10:05.980 --> 10:06.580
you

10:06.600 --> 10:09.160
How do you educate your children?

10:09.640 --> 10:10.840
Mom, please calm down.

10:10.870 --> 10:11.300
mana

10:11.320 --> 10:13.160
What kind of habit is this?

10:13.190 --> 10:14.320
Please forgive me

10:15.000 --> 10:15.940
Mom, please calm down.

10:15.940 --> 10:16.940
Myrna is still young.

10:16.960 --> 10:18.140
- He doesn't know anything.
- Stay out of the way.

10:18.590 --> 10:18.950
Mother

10:18.980 --> 10:19.580
Honey

10:20.060 --> 10:20.820
Mother

10:21.220 --> 10:21.740
Honey

10:22.010 --> 10:23.630
Mom, are you okay?

10:23.890 --> 10:25.100
Mom, are you okay?

10:25.140 --> 10:25.580
I am fine

10:25.580 --> 10:26.450
Mom, are you okay?

10:26.450 --> 10:27.700
I am fine

10:28.180 --> 10:28.970
Go to your mother first

10:30.220 --> 10:32.220
sit here

10:34.660 --> 10:35.780
please give me the money back

10:36.860 --> 10:37.420
What are you doing?

10:39.390 --> 10:40.570
What did you do to your aunt?

10:40.590 --> 10:41.550
if you don't refund the money

10:41.580 --> 10:42.300
Don't even think about leaving here.

10:42.450 --> 10:43.170
leave this

10:43.820 --> 10:44.620
- Let go of my hand
- Mana

10:44.820 --> 10:45.460
let go of your hand

10:45.640 --> 10:47.070
leave this

10:47.100 --> 10:47.460
mana

10:48.700 --> 10:49.700
our mothers and daughters

10:50.020 --> 10:50.950
How are you doing now?

10:50.980 --> 10:52.470
How do you educate your children?

10:52.870 --> 10:54.350
- Myrna
- How are you doing now?

10:55.410 --> 10:57.190
Why are you like this?

10:57.220 --> 10:58.100
Why don't you listen?

10:58.740 --> 10:59.850
Are you saying I won't listen?

11:00.470 --> 11:01.490
Those people make me sad

11:01.520 --> 11:02.430
I took the money I earned

11:02.460 --> 11:03.460
Do you still say such things now?

11:03.980 --> 11:04.980
This is no different from knife robbery.

11:05.650 --> 11:07.290
What if I called your grandmother a robber?

11:07.700 --> 11:08.700
Because we are a family

11:09.180 --> 11:11.070
Give the family money to your grandmother

11:11.100 --> 11:12.100
Naturally, leave it to me.

11:17.580 --> 11:18.100
sochir

11:18.460 --> 11:19.030
There is money in my room

11:19.050 --> 11:19.860
Who told grandma?

11:20.580 --> 11:21.580
my aunt

11:21.980 --> 11:22.980
Located in Daqing

11:23.580 --> 11:24.980
I told my grandma

11:43.220 --> 11:44.580
Brother Mana

11:45.060 --> 11:46.300
How is this going?

11:48.820 --> 11:50.660
if something happens

11:50.690 --> 11:51.340
I need to discuss this with my grandmother and grandfather.

11:51.410 --> 11:52.140
stay away

11:52.180 --> 11:52.820
If you take one step closer

11:52.980 --> 11:53.980
I'm going to scream

12:10.220 --> 12:10.740
I am Hua again

12:10.740 --> 12:11.820
i thought this would be great

12:12.420 --> 12:13.460
Are you afraid too?

12:15.980 --> 12:17.460
this time

12:18.510 --> 12:19.860
I can only say it's because I'm unlucky.

12:20.940 --> 12:22.120
But in the future, Hua ah

12:22.150 --> 12:23.920
If you did something behind the scenes again

12:24.540 --> 12:25.730
I am here to tell you that I will not remain silent either.

12:28.500 --> 12:29.340
Brother Mana

12:30.050 --> 12:31.440
Now what does this mean?

12:32.210 --> 12:33.700
I don't even know what you're talking about

12:34.580 --> 12:35.580
My aunt does hate me, but

12:36.460 --> 12:37.500
I'm not very smart

12:38.170 --> 12:39.680
People who look at me every day and try to hurt me

12:41.220 --> 12:42.270
in this house

12:42.290 --> 12:43.600
I have only one sister

12:44.020 --> 12:45.610
I didn't expect them to use such despicable means.

12:46.180 --> 12:46.940
I seduced my aunt

12:46.960 --> 12:47.800
You want me to tell my grandma...

12:49.820 --> 12:50.700
my aunt is very slow

12:50.740 --> 12:51.550
grandma likes money

12:51.980 --> 12:53.420
Because my father is a good and filial son.

12:53.760 --> 12:54.680
I thought you wouldn't take my side.

12:56.860 --> 12:57.340
Sister Hua

12:57.820 --> 12:59.340
You really use your brain very well.

13:00.220 --> 13:01.180
However

13:01.490 --> 13:02.120
That smart head

13:02.150 --> 13:03.190
I rarely use it for things like this

13:03.220 --> 13:04.220
Isn't this a waste?

13:05.820 --> 13:07.010
Now, if you marry into the Song family,

13:07.650 --> 13:08.900
My sister will definitely grow up.

13:12.810 --> 13:13.700
Brother Mana

13:15.820 --> 13:16.790
i must misunderstand

13:17.220 --> 13:18.270
I told my aunt

13:18.300 --> 13:19.740
I never mentioned the money bag.

13:19.980 --> 13:21.100
that's my grandmother

13:21.100 --> 13:22.130
Let your aunt do it

13:22.220 --> 13:23.740
I let you see it

13:24.100 --> 13:24.700
Sister Hua

13:25.000 --> 13:26.220
i have already done

13:27.980 --> 13:29.500
Have you ever said the word "money bag"?

13:32.580 --> 13:33.180
Did you do this on purpose?

13:34.100 --> 13:34.830
even when i come here

13:34.860 --> 13:36.220
I'm not sure

13:37.980 --> 13:38.980
now I understand

13:41.460 --> 13:42.180
I'm sure that's what my sister said.

13:44.620 --> 13:45.890
in front of me from now on

13:47.100 --> 13:47.700
you don't have to act

13:49.770 --> 13:51.050
Don't worry,
I won't hit you.

13:53.100 --> 13:53.740
bad guy

13:55.310 --> 13:56.300
Heaven will take care of it.

14:32.800 --> 14:33.810
you are relaxed

14:38.760 --> 14:40.050
Don't you ask me what's wrong?

14:40.500 --> 14:41.820
If you want to talk, you will talk.

14:44.180 --> 14:45.040
Your favorite grandma Yan

14:45.060 --> 14:46.300
They took all the money we made

14:48.580 --> 14:49.220
I wish I knew it would be like this

14:49.710 --> 14:50.190
give you money

14:50.220 --> 14:51.300
I didn't give them all...

14:52.980 --> 14:53.940
Are you laughing now?

14:54.330 --> 14:55.340
we had a hard time

14:55.340 --> 14:56.060
This is the money I earn

14:56.700 --> 14:57.390
grandmother

14:57.420 --> 14:58.340
you took it all

14:59.860 --> 15:00.820
But what's even more ridiculous is

15:01.060 --> 15:02.580
My dad thinks it’s okay.

15:03.430 --> 15:04.510
Does this make sense?

15:05.000 --> 15:06.360
You
grew up in Yanjia.

15:06.860 --> 15:07.460
this kind of thing

15:08.060 --> 15:09.220
Aren't you used to it now?

15:09.580 --> 15:10.460
I am...

15:13.970 --> 15:14.980
I won't talk about unnecessary things.

15:19.050 --> 15:20.410
Your grandmother thinks you are beautiful.

15:21.580 --> 15:22.980
you

15:24.100 --> 15:25.180
I say nice things next to grandma

15:25.300 --> 15:26.700
that money

15:27.450 --> 15:28.890
Can't I give it back to you?

15:32.100 --> 15:33.070
I'm not even from the Yan family.

15:33.580 --> 15:35.220
You regard money as life

15:35.490 --> 15:36.820
to your grandmother

15:37.100 --> 15:37.940
If I asked you for money, would you give it to me?

15:39.060 --> 15:40.190
Well, really

15:40.220 --> 15:41.980
Do you just want to see it?

15:45.220 --> 15:46.700
Thought it was a good experience

15:47.740 --> 15:48.880
I have lost my money now

15:49.230 --> 15:50.710
better

15:51.420 --> 15:52.470
Later when you make a lot of money

15:52.500 --> 15:53.580
Better than being taken away

15:54.220 --> 15:55.620
I learned a big lesson with very little money

15:56.100 --> 15:57.100
That's never a bad thing

15:57.560 --> 15:58.200
Yes or no?

15:58.840 --> 15:59.350
that's right

16:02.480 --> 16:03.520
I feel like I made some money

16:07.460 --> 16:08.580
I am always thinking

16:10.100 --> 16:11.380
when i look into the distance

16:12.180 --> 16:13.700
There's only one way to live our lives

16:16.980 --> 16:17.420
It's Benga.

16:18.340 --> 16:19.000
Need to branch out

16:19.220 --> 16:20.320
money we make

16:20.460 --> 16:21.220
Complete land

16:23.170 --> 16:23.640
become ours

16:23.820 --> 16:24.820
easy to say, hard to do

16:25.380 --> 16:26.880
Of course your grandfather and grandmother

16:27.220 --> 16:28.030
if your parents knew

16:28.060 --> 16:28.870
Everyone will object

16:29.180 --> 16:29.770
However, I still have to live separately.

16:30.610 --> 16:31.490
now I understand

16:32.290 --> 16:33.300
My dad and mom are not stupid.

16:33.860 --> 16:35.060
What keeps happening is

16:35.460 --> 16:36.580
my heart is so soft

16:36.580 --> 16:37.580
Because I'm full of loyalty

16:38.500 --> 16:40.100
I sacrifice a lot for my family .

16:40.820 --> 16:41.580
but some people

16:41.580 --> 16:42.220
You don't consider us family

16:42.220 --> 16:43.220
my parents don't know

16:45.220 --> 16:46.460
Have you ever wondered how to grow your business?

16:48.940 --> 16:49.580
Do you have any good ideas?

16:49.940 --> 16:50.420
I?

16:51.940 --> 16:52.740
i am a stranger

16:53.460 --> 16:54.690
you are my family

16:55.100 --> 16:56.260
I don't want to get involved in your household chores.

16:56.580 --> 16:57.300
It's too late

16:57.460 --> 16:57.900
Go in and sleep.

16:59.780 --> 17:00.140
Hey

17:00.500 --> 17:01.690
You are really smart

17:01.710 --> 17:02.430
Think quickly.

17:04.880 --> 17:05.540
simrak

17:05.980 --> 17:06.589
simrak

17:06.609 --> 17:07.339
Brother Simrak

17:07.980 --> 17:08.619
simrak

17:09.220 --> 17:10.140
think quickly

17:43.910 --> 17:45.300
If you cut rice with your bare hands

17:45.920 --> 17:47.240
In what time did you accomplish all this?

17:54.860 --> 17:56.020
everyone is working

17:56.340 --> 17:57.500
they are looking at us

17:57.920 --> 17:58.700
you can't be lazy

18:08.680 --> 18:10.350
never...

18:10.390 --> 18:11.270
Tina?

18:13.510 --> 18:15.320
You are a farmer in Xinjia Village.

18:15.390 --> 18:16.310
People whose families have a lot of land

18:17.220 --> 18:18.490
Don't you know how to cut rice?

18:22.540 --> 18:23.060
I will teach you

18:26.020 --> 18:26.700
grab rice

18:27.220 --> 18:28.830
five fingers off the ground

18:28.860 --> 18:29.370
Just cut the rice

18:30.140 --> 18:31.460
Be careful not to hurt your hands

18:32.920 --> 18:33.690
you have big hands

18:34.530 --> 18:36.000
You can catch many things at once

18:36.060 --> 18:36.540
look

18:37.700 --> 18:38.260
Is it simple?

19:11.060 --> 19:11.900
Mother

19:13.040 --> 19:14.150
Be careful

19:14.180 --> 19:15.180
You almost fell.

19:15.540 --> 19:16.810
If you have a baby in your belly, be careful.

19:16.830 --> 19:17.630
What?

19:18.540 --> 19:19.060
I also have a child in my belly

19:19.080 --> 19:20.870
Be careful.

19:21.900 --> 19:22.660
The third

19:23.500 --> 19:24.220
you stop working

19:24.900 --> 19:26.110
superior

19:26.140 --> 19:27.820
tie up the rice

19:28.300 --> 19:28.740
Let's go quickly

19:36.590 --> 19:37.590
But I still have a conscience

19:48.260 --> 19:48.700
This is the first one

19:49.780 --> 19:50.260
me a few days ago

19:50.260 --> 19:51.220
what i talked about

19:51.240 --> 19:52.400
Have you thought about it seriously?

19:53.380 --> 19:54.280
former father's

19:54.660 --> 19:56.500
I will do what I want.

19:56.780 --> 19:59.140
Would your wife do the same thing?

19:59.500 --> 20:00.220
certainly

20:02.260 --> 20:03.490
After the rice harvest

20:04.220 --> 20:05.700
I will tell my family

20:08.860 --> 20:09.680
federal

20:10.790 --> 20:12.840
Although the prisoner was a brilliant man;

20:13.140 --> 20:14.690
Do you come back to work every year?

20:15.110 --> 20:15.710
I `m coming out

20:15.740 --> 20:17.150
Not working

20:17.180 --> 20:18.460
They asked me to study at home

20:18.700 --> 20:19.420
Not listening

20:19.700 --> 20:20.700
They said they would come to work.

20:21.280 --> 20:21.720
Father

20:22.380 --> 20:23.700
I am

20:23.870 --> 20:24.800
I can't even express my filial piety.

20:24.980 --> 20:25.900
of course i should do this

20:26.450 --> 20:27.900
He is a filial son

20:28.300 --> 20:28.970
That's very good

20:29.720 --> 20:30.950
My uncle doesn't have much work

20:30.980 --> 20:32.700
What kind of trouble is this?

20:33.790 --> 20:34.960
Although I'm late

20:35.230 --> 20:36.520
Where is the time to talk?

20:37.170 --> 20:37.700
Go quickly

20:37.980 --> 20:39.220
get to work

20:39.780 --> 20:40.700
Are you going to work?

20:41.060 --> 20:41.460
Yes

20:42.290 --> 20:43.590
What is a filial son?

20:43.890 --> 20:45.050
Drag my son out

20:45.140 --> 20:45.930
Just pretending to be working

20:46.110 --> 20:47.630
You are bragging to the villagers.

20:49.680 --> 20:50.440
soon

20:51.000 --> 20:52.030
The first son who couldn't even do that job

20:52.160 --> 20:53.520
I'm sure they're going to make a fuss because it hurts

21:00.980 --> 21:01.540
What's wrong?

21:02.060 --> 21:03.050
Uncle, why are you doing this?

21:03.580 --> 21:04.710
I sprained my ankle

21:05.070 --> 21:06.410
I sprained my ankle

21:06.430 --> 21:07.270
sit here

21:08.390 --> 21:09.260
I will take a look

21:09.290 --> 21:09.900
No

21:10.430 --> 21:12.150
Dad, it's okay.

21:12.870 --> 21:13.930
Rest in the shade

21:15.320 --> 21:16.320
Shipping rice later

21:16.340 --> 21:17.130
Because the car is coming

21:17.460 --> 21:18.380
You ride it home

21:18.400 --> 21:19.350
You don't have to come tomorrow

21:20.130 --> 21:20.970
- No
- Come on.

21:21.220 --> 21:22.540
Dad, I'm fine.

21:22.540 --> 21:23.060
Go and take a rest quickly

21:23.060 --> 21:24.140
Dad, I'm fine.

21:24.220 --> 21:24.650
elder brother

21:24.980 --> 21:25.460
elder brother

21:25.980 --> 21:26.980
Do as your father says.

21:27.360 --> 21:28.090
This is

21:28.110 --> 21:29.110
Leave it to me and my brother.

21:30.530 --> 21:31.050
go

21:31.510 --> 21:32.950
That is...

21:35.270 --> 21:35.940
sorry

21:36.220 --> 21:37.080
sorry

21:37.700 --> 21:38.780
Thank you to my two brothers

21:39.380 --> 21:40.050
Be careful

21:41.220 --> 21:42.140
Take care, uncle.

21:47.590 --> 21:48.870
Another person limped home

21:53.780 --> 21:55.140
Did you sprain your ankle too?

21:57.250 --> 21:58.220
Father, why are you doing this?

21:58.860 --> 21:59.350
OMG

22:00.010 --> 22:00.760
shroud

22:00.940 --> 22:01.410
Father

22:01.740 --> 22:03.020
Father, look at this man.

22:03.780 --> 22:05.260
Work as long as you have breath

22:06.180 --> 22:07.870
I have to harvest all the rice in the next few days.

22:08.540 --> 22:10.550
When the rice is ripe, the wind blows

22:10.570 --> 22:11.080
when it fell to the ground

22:11.120 --> 22:12.510
Are you and your wife going to pack it all in?

22:12.610 --> 22:13.750
But if the elder brother stumbles

22:14.210 --> 22:14.840
Why can't I rest?

22:14.880 --> 22:15.760
that's right

22:15.780 --> 22:16.900
How do you compare to your big brother?

22:17.500 --> 22:18.150
your big brother

22:18.180 --> 22:19.580
I am a learning genius

22:19.890 --> 22:22.390
you know how to fool around

22:22.420 --> 22:22.980
when you go back

22:23.000 --> 22:24.440
like before

22:24.620 --> 22:25.220
go to casino

22:25.220 --> 22:26.330
It's obvious I'm going to lose my money

22:27.700 --> 22:29.020
Why do you say that?

22:30.150 --> 22:31.190
i can work

22:36.140 --> 22:36.990
- Is your ankle sprained too?
- Mother

22:37.010 --> 22:37.660
No

22:37.680 --> 22:38.580
Already ruined

22:41.020 --> 22:41.630
Father

22:41.780 --> 22:42.980
What's wrong with you?

22:43.340 --> 22:44.730
I think I need to go home and use the bathroom.

22:45.870 --> 22:46.300
Mother

22:46.930 --> 22:47.510
I go to the bathroom

22:47.540 --> 22:48.220
Can I find you a seat?

22:48.240 --> 22:49.040
don't block my way

22:49.070 --> 22:49.510
move

22:50.780 --> 22:53.540
That's what lazy people say.

22:59.790 --> 23:01.740
In your family, people who are good at their jobs
work more.

23:08.360 --> 23:09.260
I have sunflower seeds at home

23:09.300 --> 23:10.740
Why is everything moldy?

23:15.620 --> 23:16.130
You came

23:17.740 --> 23:18.220
Father

23:19.090 --> 23:20.470
walk slowly

23:21.440 --> 23:21.850
Wow ah ah

23:22.360 --> 23:23.800
Help your dad into the room

23:24.580 --> 23:25.430
Dad, why are you like this?

23:25.450 --> 23:26.600
i lost my foot

23:29.220 --> 23:30.980
This year is a good harvest

23:42.060 --> 23:43.180
What are you doing?

23:43.450 --> 23:44.930
If you're not working, just go over there and sit.

23:45.100 --> 23:45.870
Because you might accidentally cut it.

23:46.740 --> 23:47.240
Hey

23:47.350 --> 23:48.630
Sua

23:48.980 --> 23:50.360
Because Mana didn't mean it.

23:50.650 --> 23:51.580
do not be angry

23:51.890 --> 23:52.540
also very hot

23:52.540 --> 23:53.130
hurry

23:53.200 --> 23:54.040
Go in and take a rest

23:58.550 --> 23:59.260
Aunt

23:59.690 --> 24:00.220
Aunt

24:00.530 --> 24:01.460
Don’t you peel sunflower seeds?

24:01.860 --> 24:02.500
I have no appetite

24:03.220 --> 24:04.060
Look at Yanmanya

24:04.260 --> 24:05.700
It was obvious that he had done this on purpose before.

24:07.660 --> 24:09.020
Mana's aunt

24:09.040 --> 24:10.000
People tend to look at it in a funny way.

24:10.500 --> 24:11.190
a few days ago

24:11.220 --> 24:12.740
When mom took Yan Maner's money

24:13.080 --> 24:13.860
Yan Manya grabbed my hair.

24:13.880 --> 24:14.910
I just moved on

24:14.930 --> 24:15.640
but he

24:15.740 --> 24:17.180
Fight me in a hostile manner

24:18.860 --> 24:19.420
Aunt

24:20.060 --> 24:21.280
Auntie is broad-minded and understands, but

24:21.330 --> 24:22.030
Even ten thousand

24:22.060 --> 24:23.140
This is different.

24:24.060 --> 24:25.870
The problem is that auntie is too gentle.

24:26.300 --> 24:27.420
if you continue to do this

24:27.610 --> 24:29.030
something young

24:29.050 --> 24:30.000
I will fight back without fear

24:31.220 --> 24:31.780
you're right

24:32.060 --> 24:33.420
It's because I'm so nice

24:34.850 --> 24:35.840
But that's what Mana did.

24:35.860 --> 24:36.700
what should I do?

24:37.220 --> 24:37.900
Aunt

24:38.540 --> 24:40.110
Because my aunt is too soft.

24:40.940 --> 24:41.500
we find another way

24:42.020 --> 24:43.260
Even ten thousand

24:43.840 --> 24:44.770
How about scolding him?

24:46.420 --> 24:47.220
still

24:47.620 --> 24:49.540
This is a Korean family.

24:49.940 --> 24:51.130
Already gone too far

24:51.260 --> 24:52.660
If you are an enemy of Mana,

24:53.180 --> 24:54.460
My father won't leave me alone

24:58.220 --> 25:00.660
Your aunt is right.

25:02.180 --> 25:03.460
But it's still Korean...

25:44.900 --> 25:46.380
I'll be behind you,
please be careful.

26:08.220 --> 26:10.020
Friends, please take a look

26:10.700 --> 26:11.260
I am

26:11.900 --> 26:12.730
I prepared a small gift

26:14.540 --> 26:15.260
please accept this

26:17.020 --> 26:17.900
Please take a look

26:25.370 --> 26:26.520
If it's still like before

26:26.940 --> 26:28.820
If you do, I'll accept it.

26:29.940 --> 26:30.700
Today I

26:32.020 --> 26:33.460
I took care of a lot of kids.

26:34.080 --> 26:35.960
Even if I said I would allow it

26:36.230 --> 26:37.910
My kids wouldn’t agree.

26:40.180 --> 26:40.870
our

26:40.900 --> 26:41.740
don't break the rules

26:42.200 --> 26:42.910
rule?

26:46.700 --> 26:48.180
I am the rule

26:48.590 --> 26:49.190
start

26:49.270 --> 26:49.670
it's here

26:49.700 --> 26:50.300
Go quickly

27:04.900 --> 27:06.820
everyone stop

27:06.910 --> 27:08.130
you...

27:09.580 --> 27:10.450
you took it

27:10.630 --> 27:11.850
Do you know who this item belongs to?

27:12.220 --> 27:13.460
He is from the Song family.

27:13.640 --> 27:15.430
that's what i want

27:18.620 --> 27:20.580
If you have nothing to fear,
say your name.

27:22.380 --> 27:24.090
Do you want to know my name?

28:50.140 --> 28:51.820
Bandits stole the Song family's belongings?

28:52.220 --> 28:52.660
that's right

28:55.830 --> 28:56.940
one step ahead of us

28:56.960 --> 28:58.000
I didn't expect anyone to move so fast

28:59.880 --> 29:00.980
What are these people doing?

29:01.110 --> 29:02.520
Did you discover anything?

29:03.660 --> 29:04.590
To the intersection where I walked

29:04.620 --> 29:05.460
I follow

29:06.410 --> 29:07.940
They tied branches to the wagon

29:08.470 --> 29:09.800
By erasing wheel marks

29:10.070 --> 29:11.070
I can't keep up

29:12.220 --> 29:12.980
but their

29:12.980 --> 29:13.940
If you look at behavior

29:14.420 --> 29:15.600
Not an ordinary person

29:16.020 --> 29:16.740
if you listen to me

29:17.660 --> 29:19.250
I think the Song family is the target.

29:20.990 --> 29:21.830
Song family

29:21.860 --> 29:22.740
Others took aim at it.

29:24.140 --> 29:25.030
Song family

29:25.680 --> 29:26.700
One of the best in the area

29:26.720 --> 29:27.630
Because I come from a wealthy family

29:28.110 --> 29:29.390
There must be a lot of people targeting them.

29:30.980 --> 29:31.940
So are we

29:31.960 --> 29:33.350
caught a big fish

29:33.540 --> 29:34.740
like this

29:35.540 --> 29:37.190
This time,
I was caught in the middle by someone else.

29:37.990 --> 29:39.230
Still, you are aware of their presence.

29:40.550 --> 29:41.680
The items carried by the Song family are

29:42.130 --> 29:42.900
like a pine forest

29:43.740 --> 29:44.380
It turns out to be salt

29:46.540 --> 29:47.720
It was indeed a big fish.

29:49.380 --> 29:50.620
What was our purpose last time?

29:50.620 --> 29:51.460
President Julu

29:52.860 --> 29:54.260
It is indeed related to the Song family.

29:55.830 --> 29:57.790
Not long after, the Song family's belongings were stolen.

29:58.650 --> 29:59.750
for the time being

30:00.770 --> 30:01.720
I won't bring anything in there.

30:02.460 --> 30:03.220
Master, don't worry.

30:03.460 --> 30:04.180
Mr. Song family

30:04.180 --> 30:05.260
I often come here to watch theater these days.

30:05.700 --> 30:06.220
I'm here

30:06.220 --> 30:07.180
let us know more

30:12.910 --> 30:13.350
Why are you doing this?

30:13.670 --> 30:14.690
What's wrong?

30:19.140 --> 30:19.910
Where

30:19.940 --> 30:21.460
I think I saw those robbers

30:24.480 --> 30:25.290
Now is not the time to worry about this.

30:25.980 --> 30:27.980
As before, if there is any new information

30:28.390 --> 30:29.820
A piece of red cloth tied in front of the hotel door

30:30.300 --> 30:30.980
when i see

30:31.000 --> 30:31.870
i will come to see you

30:34.740 --> 30:35.380
Government agency personnel

30:35.700 --> 30:36.460
these days

30:36.540 --> 30:37.770
Very quiet but

30:37.940 --> 30:39.380
I won't leave you alone, sir.

30:39.890 --> 30:41.460
Pay attention to your surroundings

30:41.700 --> 30:42.740
Even when hiding in the Yan family

30:42.760 --> 30:44.080
you need to be more careful

30:45.300 --> 30:46.380
This is harvest season.

30:47.220 --> 30:48.420
There is another person working in the Yan family.

30:48.440 --> 30:49.200
you will like it

30:50.220 --> 30:50.740
You do not have to worry about

30:51.400 --> 30:52.640
they won't doubt me

30:53.100 --> 30:53.500
Yes

31:07.210 --> 31:07.780
The third

31:08.130 --> 31:09.180
Today you

31:09.200 --> 31:10.140
cut the rice

31:10.180 --> 31:11.320
tie them together

31:11.350 --> 31:12.080
tonight

31:12.100 --> 31:13.050
I have to drag it.

31:14.650 --> 31:15.200
elderly

31:22.500 --> 31:23.900
You've never had a job before, right?

31:28.310 --> 31:28.820
that's right

31:29.840 --> 31:31.040
What seems easy at first glance

31:31.250 --> 31:32.510
It's not easy when you try

31:33.310 --> 31:34.530
My hands are all scarred

31:35.020 --> 31:35.460
elderly

31:35.480 --> 31:36.370
You notice it right away.

31:36.400 --> 31:38.080
I didn't recognize you because of the wound.

31:38.540 --> 31:40.140
people who farm

31:40.260 --> 31:41.850
Even your hands can get hurt

31:42.060 --> 31:43.060
This is how everyone learns things.

31:44.150 --> 31:45.970
But the farmers

31:46.020 --> 31:47.180
I tried farming

31:47.970 --> 31:49.890
I know the importance of rice

31:50.420 --> 31:52.530
I'm not as harsh on rice as you are.

31:52.560 --> 31:53.970
fell to the floor

31:54.060 --> 31:54.890
look at the rice fields

31:56.980 --> 31:57.900
Come here and take a rest

32:05.220 --> 32:06.420
You are from our Yan family.

32:07.290 --> 32:08.620
I've been here for a while

32:11.450 --> 32:13.120
Flooding occurred in Castle Peak.

32:13.460 --> 32:15.540
Your aunt takes you home

32:16.220 --> 32:16.980
man

32:17.700 --> 32:18.980
The backbone of the family

32:19.440 --> 32:20.760
at my house

32:20.950 --> 32:22.560
you won't last long

32:23.290 --> 32:24.610
What do you plan to do next?

32:27.780 --> 32:28.460
Help old people and aunties

32:29.310 --> 32:31.360
when the harvest is complete

32:31.700 --> 32:33.010
I'm going to the city to find a job.

32:37.060 --> 32:37.700
elderly

32:38.500 --> 32:39.970
I think the harvest is good this year.

32:40.800 --> 32:41.870
If you take the remaining rice to the village,

32:42.260 --> 32:43.700
You can get beef and lamb, right?

32:46.130 --> 32:47.540
you

32:47.540 --> 32:50.140
That's so naive.

32:50.620 --> 32:51.210
I am a fool

32:51.780 --> 32:52.740
Please teach me, senior

32:55.130 --> 32:56.120
farmers

32:56.860 --> 32:58.620
small agricultural equipment

32:59.220 --> 33:00.380
Of course straw sandals

33:00.910 --> 33:02.670
land and

33:02.700 --> 33:03.780
even beasts

33:03.800 --> 33:04.520
pay taxes

33:04.550 --> 33:06.300
There's nothing I wouldn't pay for

33:07.140 --> 33:10.350
Nowadays, peasants are divided into five classes.

33:10.700 --> 33:11.950
The more wealth you have

33:11.980 --> 33:13.860
Have to pay a lot of taxes

33:14.250 --> 33:16.370
But who dares to bring animals in?

33:19.100 --> 33:19.760
everyone just

33:19.820 --> 33:22.110
My life is roughly

33:24.260 --> 33:25.220
But as far as I know

33:25.420 --> 33:26.860
Wars often occur in border areas.

33:27.080 --> 33:28.480
Temporarily in mediation

33:28.510 --> 33:29.430
They say they charge a lot of taxes

33:30.060 --> 33:30.700
in government office

33:30.740 --> 33:31.740
Peasants were divided into five classes.

33:31.980 --> 33:33.180
Don’t you want to make sure your taxes are paid fairly?

33:34.140 --> 33:35.500
I don't need to know this

33:36.300 --> 33:37.380
in my eyes

33:37.780 --> 33:39.680
Farmers’ classification rights

33:39.710 --> 33:41.590
All I can see is that the local governor is saying all this.

33:42.220 --> 33:43.190
These few years

33:43.220 --> 33:45.380
local governor and injured

33:45.400 --> 33:46.770
hold hands

33:47.220 --> 33:48.670
After expropriating farmers’ land

33:48.700 --> 33:50.660
They even call it a revolution

33:50.930 --> 33:52.880
Because local officials have great power

33:53.120 --> 33:54.360
people

33:54.390 --> 33:56.480
It's really hard to live

34:05.370 --> 34:05.900
The third

34:06.900 --> 34:07.380
third

34:08.280 --> 34:08.889
You go home

34:08.909 --> 34:10.230
Grab some bottles of water.

34:15.350 --> 34:15.820
Father

34:16.190 --> 34:18.199
Westerners are good at cutting rice.

34:18.230 --> 34:18.750
certainly

34:18.770 --> 34:19.850
I have to work in the fields

34:20.179 --> 34:20.580
I will be back

34:22.820 --> 34:23.120
Father

34:23.270 --> 34:24.540
I'm a fast runner
, so I'll go for it.

34:25.050 --> 34:25.650
No

34:27.880 --> 34:28.630
Got a house

34:28.659 --> 34:29.530
Because the distance is so far

34:29.670 --> 34:30.840
Because if you leave, you're going to have a hard time

34:31.179 --> 34:32.460
I will go

34:32.889 --> 34:34.250
You have suffered a lot because of your husband's incompetence .

34:34.280 --> 34:35.320
This time you take a break

34:35.340 --> 34:35.820
I will go

34:35.960 --> 34:36.650
you...

34:36.670 --> 34:37.909
let go of your hand

34:37.949 --> 34:38.340
I will go

34:38.370 --> 34:39.400
You've been to the bathroom several times.

34:39.440 --> 34:40.480
- I'm going to
- stop.

34:41.810 --> 34:42.489
you go

34:48.550 --> 34:49.310
OK

34:51.900 --> 34:52.380
ruler

34:58.140 --> 34:58.890
Where should I go?

35:17.240 --> 35:17.720
Sua

35:18.080 --> 35:18.720
It's not hot now

35:19.300 --> 35:19.980
eat slowly

35:34.650 --> 35:35.900
Why are you here?

35:37.230 --> 35:38.290
Grandpa asked me to get some water.

35:42.190 --> 35:42.560
grandmother

35:43.300 --> 35:43.950
our lunch

35:43.980 --> 35:44.860
It's a sumptuous feast.

35:44.880 --> 35:46.080
There was even a land battle...

35:47.390 --> 35:48.390
Dreams are also big

35:48.780 --> 35:49.880
I made this for me and my brother

35:49.900 --> 35:50.660
This is a land war

35:50.690 --> 35:51.230
There's nothing for you to eat

35:52.180 --> 35:53.940
Mana has been working for a few days.

35:54.370 --> 35:55.800
It's really troublesome

35:56.140 --> 35:57.540
Is he in any trouble?

35:57.760 --> 35:59.400
A country girl goes to the rice fields

35:59.620 --> 36:00.460
this is a familiar thing

36:00.900 --> 36:01.980
your uncle

36:02.240 --> 36:03.820
I sprained my ankle while cutting rice.

36:03.840 --> 36:05.140
He said he wanted to eat meatloaf.

36:05.630 --> 36:07.540
You're like a hungry ghost attached to your body

36:07.540 --> 36:08.440
No need to worry about physical confrontation

36:08.590 --> 36:09.470
I bake pancakes

36:09.500 --> 36:10.580
take it to the grave

36:10.740 --> 36:11.870
Don't talk on the field

36:13.650 --> 36:15.300
look in the mirror

36:16.010 --> 36:17.380
Do you think you are suitable for eating meatloaf?

36:24.820 --> 36:25.460
What are you looking at?

36:26.940 --> 36:27.660
nothing

36:28.010 --> 36:29.260
just my aunt

36:29.280 --> 36:30.270
Holding Yutian in hand

36:30.300 --> 36:31.170
It looks very tasty

36:31.660 --> 36:32.670
Can you please give me a bite?

36:32.980 --> 36:34.570
I speak so fast

36:35.340 --> 36:35.980
Mother

36:36.000 --> 36:37.070
Look at him.

36:37.100 --> 36:38.020
This girl...

36:38.040 --> 36:39.100
girl...

36:39.130 --> 36:39.960
grandmother

36:40.750 --> 36:41.400
do not be angry

36:41.420 --> 36:42.200
i will talk to you

36:57.100 --> 36:57.660
mana

36:58.180 --> 36:58.900
my father

36:59.020 --> 37:00.860
You have never worked in the fields.

37:01.330 --> 37:03.210
But you sprained your ankle.

37:04.260 --> 37:05.670
I want to eat something delicious.

37:06.580 --> 37:08.070
grandma told me

37:08.100 --> 37:08.940
You can't send too much.

37:09.300 --> 37:11.020
you take this

37:11.260 --> 37:12.020
Eat it while it's hot

37:12.500 --> 37:13.180
after eating everything

37:13.410 --> 37:14.230
go to the fields

37:14.940 --> 37:16.420
Don't talk after eating the pancakes

37:16.980 --> 37:18.380
If you speak I will rip your mouth off

37:19.230 --> 37:20.110
Don't worry,
I'll never tell you.

37:20.770 --> 37:21.440
if i speak

37:21.750 --> 37:22.820
He died of poisoning while drinking water.

37:22.920 --> 37:23.750
When it rains, you will die if you are struck by lightning

37:24.020 --> 37:24.770
When going out

37:24.790 --> 37:25.710
There are four horses at the entrance of the village

37:25.740 --> 37:26.590
Hit by a car

37:26.620 --> 37:27.420
you will die

37:34.130 --> 37:35.610
This land battle

37:36.350 --> 37:37.580
Where did you get it?

37:43.060 --> 37:44.240
I can't speak

37:45.420 --> 37:45.900
explain

37:46.720 --> 37:47.620
There is a grandpa

37:50.820 --> 37:52.410
I went to get water

37:53.340 --> 37:54.530
with grandma

37:55.260 --> 37:55.740
Wow ah ah

37:55.760 --> 37:56.600
And my aunt

37:57.460 --> 37:58.900
I saw a pot full of beef stew.

37:59.580 --> 38:00.260
I am

38:00.480 --> 38:01.060
certainly

38:01.060 --> 38:02.270
I thought you were going to give it to my family.

38:03.380 --> 38:05.260
But my aunt
refused to give it to me.

38:05.510 --> 38:06.180
OMG

38:10.140 --> 38:10.930
Sister Hua

38:11.020 --> 38:11.980
I tell other family members

38:11.980 --> 38:12.940
I'm afraid we'll be talking about land warfare

38:13.750 --> 38:15.550
He gave me one.

38:16.580 --> 38:17.890
But I have to get over my neck.

38:18.330 --> 38:18.870
tome

38:18.900 --> 38:20.300
Just a land battle

38:21.740 --> 38:23.770
Still, I'm going to give it to my grandfather.

38:23.930 --> 38:24.470
that's right

38:25.660 --> 38:27.590
Your grandfather was in the most trouble.

38:28.530 --> 38:29.440
But grandpa

38:30.330 --> 38:31.780
I really do not understand

38:31.900 --> 38:32.780
family

38:32.940 --> 38:34.170
let us overcome difficulties together

38:34.190 --> 38:35.230
Isn’t it just about sharing happiness?

38:36.210 --> 38:37.700
Have we branched out yet?

38:37.850 --> 38:38.670
Who said we should divide the houses?

38:39.020 --> 38:39.500
How could this happen?

38:39.530 --> 38:40.780
Wouldn't this be fair?

38:41.590 --> 38:41.990
second child

38:42.620 --> 38:43.270
to your mother

38:43.300 --> 38:44.500
Let's say we have beef stew for dinner tonight.

38:45.360 --> 38:45.770
Wait a moment

38:47.010 --> 38:49.330
Dad, go ahead and tell this.

38:49.360 --> 38:50.140
If I leave, my mother

38:50.160 --> 38:51.020
It's obvious they'll kick you out

38:51.600 --> 38:52.200
Then I'll go

38:53.230 --> 38:54.650
We're having beef stew for dinner tonight.

38:54.680 --> 38:54.960
Yes

38:55.220 --> 38:55.780
I can eat everything.

38:55.900 --> 38:56.490
great

38:59.100 --> 38:59.890
let's go

38:59.910 --> 39:01.040
They say you can eat until you are full.

39:01.480 --> 39:02.260
OMG

39:24.790 --> 39:26.260
thanks mana

39:26.450 --> 39:28.290
The day has come for beef stew

39:29.020 --> 39:29.620
uncle

39:29.830 --> 39:30.780
That's not it

39:31.660 --> 39:32.620
Because my grandpa is there

39:33.020 --> 39:34.180
You can eat stew.

39:34.620 --> 39:35.340
that's right

39:41.620 --> 39:42.340
Do not leave blank

39:43.380 --> 39:43.900
Eat quickly

39:50.420 --> 39:51.370
Incorporate into this meal

39:52.470 --> 39:54.700
flour and pork

39:55.390 --> 39:57.750
These are ingredients that my family can eat for 15 days.

40:01.030 --> 40:02.760
i don't even know

40:03.190 --> 40:04.100
house

40:04.130 --> 40:05.000
I'm going crazy trying to waste it.

40:05.590 --> 40:06.710
Who are you saying this to?

40:07.300 --> 40:08.460
I do not work

40:09.060 --> 40:10.820
Are you the only one working?

40:11.870 --> 40:12.950
my family

40:12.980 --> 40:14.100
what do i eat for every meal

40:14.700 --> 40:16.300
Is it food falling from the sky?

40:16.940 --> 40:17.910
I am at home

40:17.940 --> 40:18.940
Are you still there?

40:24.100 --> 40:24.980
Mom, don't be angry

40:25.260 --> 40:26.340
us

40:27.020 --> 40:27.980
my family...

40:28.400 --> 40:28.800
is that so

40:29.860 --> 40:32.100
It was you who sent the message to your family.

40:32.310 --> 40:33.180
After sending jeon

40:34.180 --> 40:35.700
You're the one who nags

40:37.100 --> 40:39.980
I don't care day or night

40:40.300 --> 40:41.310
for my family

40:41.460 --> 40:42.140
I'm busy moving around

40:42.600 --> 40:43.500
What will eventually be returned

40:43.520 --> 40:44.510
All I have is your curse

40:48.770 --> 40:50.140
all because of you

40:50.880 --> 40:52.710
I took it to my grave

40:53.400 --> 40:54.920
But can you tell me right away?

40:55.300 --> 40:55.980
you

40:56.100 --> 40:57.420
Do you have no conscience?

40:58.010 --> 40:59.530
Who was the person who swore just now?

40:59.680 --> 41:00.900
Even after eating the pancakes, you're still conveying the message.

41:01.130 --> 41:02.020
Aren't you afraid that what you say will come true?

41:02.580 --> 41:04.310
I didn't even eat pancakes

41:04.940 --> 41:05.890
What is there to be afraid of?

41:06.700 --> 41:07.790
i will pray to god

41:07.810 --> 41:08.690
Come on, you'll either get struck by lightning or die.

41:08.980 --> 41:09.740
Let me be hit by a carriage.

41:10.100 --> 41:10.980
Can't you shut up?

41:12.290 --> 41:13.410
Are you human?

41:13.620 --> 41:14.570
my aunt loves her nephew

41:14.570 --> 41:16.460
Where is the curse?

41:17.930 --> 41:19.430
How can I be like you?

41:19.460 --> 41:20.620
Did she give birth to a poisonous child?

41:20.890 --> 41:22.250
It's all your mother's fault

41:22.620 --> 41:23.180
Father

41:23.660 --> 41:24.990
It's all because of Yanman.

41:25.020 --> 41:25.460
look

41:25.620 --> 41:27.180
Are you talking back now?

41:27.410 --> 41:27.980
No

41:28.000 --> 41:29.570
Why do you hit your child?

41:30.030 --> 41:30.460
Do you know how to stay still?

41:30.460 --> 41:30.980
I...

41:30.980 --> 41:31.820
I won't stand still

41:34.190 --> 41:34.550
Mother

41:34.880 --> 41:35.200
Mother

41:35.330 --> 41:35.820
go in

41:36.760 --> 41:37.720
walk into room

41:40.610 --> 41:41.090
go in

42:03.890 --> 42:05.770
【Guest Cup】

42:19.340 --> 42:19.620
let's go

42:25.290 --> 42:25.700
go

42:27.010 --> 42:28.290
an old man

42:28.850 --> 42:29.850
He is the son of the Zhang family.

42:30.300 --> 42:31.060
people are nice

42:33.060 --> 42:34.700
Why are government officials here?

42:35.310 --> 42:36.060
I know

42:36.220 --> 42:36.750
Wait a moment

42:39.240 --> 42:39.610
let's go

42:39.630 --> 42:40.400
Why are you like this today?

42:43.940 --> 42:44.380
over there

42:50.500 --> 42:51.100
where are you from?

42:52.890 --> 42:54.910
[Arrested]

42:58.140 --> 42:59.100
I am from 13li Village.

43:01.060 --> 43:02.420
I often go to Shisanli Village.

43:02.910 --> 43:03.910
Is this the first time I've met you?

43:06.390 --> 43:08.420
My hometown is Xinga Village, Qingshan County.

43:09.100 --> 43:10.380
Floods occurred at the beginning of the year

43:10.620 --> 43:11.510
Go south

43:11.570 --> 43:12.700
I live at my aunt's house.

43:13.460 --> 43:15.460
Are there any signs on the way south?

43:15.890 --> 43:16.710
No

43:17.010 --> 43:17.980
Because a natural disaster occurred

43:18.450 --> 43:19.810
Government officials also fled.

43:20.390 --> 43:21.190
Can there be a signboard?

43:21.860 --> 43:22.540

This is real

43:26.710 --> 43:28.550
I'm catching a robber in a government office.

43:28.870 --> 43:30.410
this is a picture

43:30.430 --> 43:31.400
Not only do they look alike;

43:31.720 --> 43:32.500
government agencies

43:32.740 --> 43:34.050
I don't have a certificate

43:34.620 --> 43:35.780
If you put the wrong person

43:36.060 --> 43:37.060
Of course you

43:37.540 --> 43:38.740
So are we

43:39.140 --> 43:40.220
You will not be able to escape responsibility.

Reply on the same day

43:57.460 --> 43:58.980
with you

43:59.300 --> 44:01.100
I saw them talking together.

44:01.530 --> 44:02.980
It looks like we are friendly.

44:03.460 --> 44:04.260

44:04.710 --> 44:05.460
