01:38.200 --> 01:39.560
It's okay if you want peanuts

01:40.030 --> 01:40.680
Get the prescription in exchange

01:41.200 --> 01:43.640
You, mother-in-law, you

01:43.750 --> 01:45.320
Something big happened to their family again

01:45.560 --> 01:46.560
Do you still remember the prescription?

01:47.000 --> 01:48.840
The trouble was caused by themselves

01:49.120 --> 01:50.000
I'm an old woman

01:50.200 --> 01:51.120
What can I help you with?

01:51.470 --> 01:53.470
Besides, he is my son

01:53.640 --> 01:54.280
I want a recipe from him

01:54.400 --> 01:55.030
what happened again

01:55.470 --> 01:56.920
When a black-hearted person makes money

01:57.200 --> 01:58.680
You left your parents aside

01:58.920 --> 01:59.840
have you asked

02:00.760 --> 02:01.920
Something's wrong now

02:02.280 --> 02:03.240
It comes in handy

02:03.560 --> 02:05.520
Come close to me with a stern look on your face

02:08.000 --> 02:08.960
My son has never

02:09.120 --> 02:10.160
Never thought about it that way

02:10.520 --> 02:11.400
If you say you won’t give it, you won’t give it.

02:11.560 --> 02:12.440
Don't even think about it

02:14.840 --> 02:15.400
San'er

02:16.360 --> 02:17.120
You go back first

02:18.520 --> 02:19.720
I have something to tell your mother

02:21.960 --> 02:23.160
loser

02:25.840 --> 02:26.560
No matter what

02:26.840 --> 02:28.680
She is also your biological son and granddaughter.

02:29.560 --> 02:31.400
They encountered such a big difficulty

02:31.960 --> 02:33.400
How can we not help?

02:34.120 --> 02:35.560
Being able to look at my own granddaughter

02:35.840 --> 02:36.600
Go to jail

02:37.520 --> 02:38.240
This peanut

02:38.400 --> 02:39.440
It's a precious thing

02:40.160 --> 02:41.070
You gave it to the third child

02:41.400 --> 02:42.600
When will he give the money?

02:43.120 --> 02:44.160
What if I don’t want to give you money?

02:44.560 --> 02:45.680
You let this big family

02:45.840 --> 02:46.880
Drink the northwest wind

02:47.560 --> 02:48.560
San'er and his family

02:48.560 --> 02:50.160
He is not such a person

02:50.560 --> 02:52.680
All in all, it’s all divided.

02:52.680 --> 02:54.120
You are not allowed to have any ideas about them anymore

02:54.360 --> 02:55.070
Why?

02:55.560 --> 02:56.680
He came from my belly

02:56.840 --> 02:57.680
jumped out

02:58.070 --> 02:59.560
I can't handle him yet

03:00.280 --> 03:01.080
Your mother back then

03:01.240 --> 03:02.560
That's how you handle it

03:02.800 --> 03:04.080
I'm so good at it too

03:04.840 --> 03:05.680
grandpa

03:06.600 --> 03:08.560
Don't be angry. I'm here to persuade you.

03:10.200 --> 03:11.520
It’s not that I haven’t finished talking yet.

03:11.800 --> 03:12.400
Start to open, start to open

03:13.400 --> 03:15.520
Damn, don't be angry

03:16.400 --> 03:17.560
You're so frivolous

03:17.880 --> 03:19.400
You thought I would listen to you

03:21.160 --> 03:21.840
Milk

03:22.360 --> 03:22.880
we want

03:23.120 --> 03:24.680
This garlic peanut recipe

03:25.000 --> 03:25.840
There are many ways

03:26.280 --> 03:27.000
We don't need it either

03:27.240 --> 03:28.280
Asking for it in person

03:28.800 --> 03:29.520
Moreover

03:29.840 --> 03:30.680
That girl Lian Man'er

03:30.840 --> 03:31.560
So many thoughts

03:32.000 --> 03:33.280
We can't go hard with her

03:33.600 --> 03:34.400
What do you think we should do?

03:36.600 --> 03:38.400
There is a way

03:39.120 --> 03:40.360
that is

03:41.400 --> 03:42.800
If you have something to say, say it quickly

03:42.800 --> 03:44.720
Don't dawdle, dawdle, dawdle

03:47.280 --> 03:47.800
Milk

03:48.120 --> 03:48.680
come here

03:56.280 --> 03:56.800
Man'er

03:57.120 --> 03:57.680
Man'er

03:59.000 --> 04:00.280
Your mother agreed

04:01.840 --> 04:02.600
Actually agreed

04:03.680 --> 04:04.560
Give us the market price

04:04.880 --> 04:05.680
ten cents per catty

04:06.000 --> 04:07.360
Pay it back after making money

04:09.000 --> 04:10.120
By the way, your breasts

04:10.360 --> 04:11.120
I'm afraid we won't be able to make it

04:11.280 --> 04:12.720
Send your second uncle to come over and help.

04:15.600 --> 04:16.390
Dad, I have enough manpower.

04:16.829 --> 04:17.360
What

04:18.600 --> 04:19.240
fine

04:19.600 --> 04:21.269
I just said we have enough people.

04:21.600 --> 04:22.360
No need to trouble you

04:22.800 --> 04:23.840
Look, look at this child

04:24.240 --> 04:25.600
Just be polite to me

04:26.000 --> 04:27.600
Multiple people, multiple efforts

04:27.720 --> 04:29.480
Your second uncle, I am already very capable.

04:31.360 --> 04:32.120
Come on, hurry up

04:32.560 --> 04:33.360
Bring up all that basket

04:33.680 --> 04:34.280
Come on come on

04:35.150 --> 04:35.720
Is there any basket?

04:36.040 --> 04:36.600
No more, no more

04:36.600 --> 04:37.680
Come on, come on, second uncle

04:37.840 --> 04:38.800
Come on, come on

04:38.920 --> 04:40.120
Third brother, come forward

04:40.720 --> 04:41.280
You pull me here

04:41.720 --> 04:42.600
Man'er, put it behind you and push it.

04:43.000 --> 04:43.480
right

04:43.840 --> 04:44.480
Walk

04:45.560 --> 04:46.600
Can you resist me?

04:49.150 --> 04:49.920
Forget it, let me go

04:49.920 --> 04:51.150
You've gone too far, Second Auntie

05:11.360 --> 05:12.240
Miss Maner, this money

05:12.680 --> 05:13.480
How about we come out?

05:13.720 --> 05:15.000
In case she is really in danger

05:21.600 --> 05:22.240
inappropriate

05:23.840 --> 05:24.680
So much money to pay now

05:24.840 --> 05:25.800
will be suspected

05:26.800 --> 05:27.800
The overall situation is the most important thing

05:30.400 --> 05:31.000
The fifteenth of this month

05:31.480 --> 05:33.040
The troupe will go to the Song Mansion to sing in the hall

05:33.560 --> 05:34.920
We can use this to enter the Song Mansion

05:35.360 --> 05:36.040
steal books

05:36.680 --> 05:37.720
There will be too many people at that time

05:38.120 --> 05:38.840
Easy to get started

05:40.480 --> 05:41.360
is a good time

05:42.600 --> 05:43.920
How did you convince jade to be inlaid with gold?

05:44.120 --> 05:45.150
Went to the Song Mansion singing hall

05:45.800 --> 05:47.400
Let’s listen to the play while Song’s parents are here

05:47.920 --> 05:48.600
I will call this person

05:48.720 --> 05:50.040
Recommended to Jade Inlay Gold

05:50.400 --> 05:51.600
I wanted to do it in front of the two of them

05:51.840 --> 05:52.800
contributed to this

05:53.720 --> 05:55.480
Unexpectedly, I haven’t spoken yet

05:55.800 --> 05:57.720
That leader Jade actually took the initiative to mention

05:58.400 --> 05:59.480
And in a few words

05:59.720 --> 06:00.920
He persuaded Song’s parents to follow him

06:01.160 --> 06:02.480
A date has been set for the singing hall

06:03.360 --> 06:04.160
But think about it

06:05.240 --> 06:05.920
Not surprising

06:06.360 --> 06:07.400
She is a money-loving person

06:07.920 --> 06:08.560
Whenever there is a chance

06:08.800 --> 06:09.840
Can make money from rich people

06:10.160 --> 06:11.160
How could she let it go?

06:13.040 --> 06:13.800
Actually followed us

06:14.000 --> 06:15.120
I thought of going together

06:18.240 --> 06:19.000
One more thing

06:20.600 --> 06:21.160
that day

06:21.560 --> 06:23.240
Song's parents and easy-going people met here

06:23.840 --> 06:24.720
i secretly heard

06:25.280 --> 06:26.120
they are discussing

06:26.600 --> 06:27.400
The future of the church meeting

06:27.720 --> 06:29.160
We also need to transport a batch of salt

06:36.600 --> 06:37.720
It must have been prompted by superiors

06:41.560 --> 06:42.150
No matter what

06:43.150 --> 06:44.000
Must succeed this time

06:44.560 --> 06:45.360
good

06:57.150 --> 06:58.720
Almost almost

07:09.040 --> 07:10.120
Dad, why are you here?

07:27.600 --> 07:28.160
grandfather

07:28.480 --> 07:29.480
It's enough for us to be here

07:29.840 --> 07:30.600
You go back to your house and have a rest.

07:31.240 --> 07:33.480
One hundred taels of silver will be paid for ten days

07:34.560 --> 07:36.120
A whole hundred taels

07:37.040 --> 07:38.240
I think about it in my heart

07:38.400 --> 07:39.280
So anxious

07:41.150 --> 07:42.720
By selling these peanuts

07:43.800 --> 07:45.150
Can this be put together?

07:46.600 --> 07:48.150
There is no other way now

07:48.680 --> 07:50.150
We can only make more and sell more

07:51.600 --> 07:54.150
How about I find your elder brother?

07:55.040 --> 07:56.560
See if he has any connections

07:56.800 --> 07:57.360
help you

07:57.480 --> 07:58.480
Don't bother uncle.

07:59.400 --> 08:00.160
Let's find some more

08:00.360 --> 08:01.040
How to sell peanuts

08:01.480 --> 08:02.920
Of course I can earn enough with this money.

08:22.480 --> 08:23.160
second wife

08:23.600 --> 08:25.120
You didn't pick this one

08:25.600 --> 08:26.520
The one I picked doesn’t work.

08:26.720 --> 08:27.720
You're so moldy like this

08:27.880 --> 08:28.240
OK OK

08:28.360 --> 08:29.000
You can't put this in there

08:29.120 --> 08:29.720
As deflated as this

08:29.840 --> 08:30.480
like these things

08:30.640 --> 08:31.440
It's not a choice

08:31.440 --> 08:32.320
What's for sale

08:32.520 --> 08:33.600
Have to pick carefully

08:33.840 --> 08:34.320
if not

08:34.360 --> 08:35.360
It doesn't sell for the price

08:36.240 --> 08:36.760
father

08:37.120 --> 08:38.240
I'm working

08:38.520 --> 08:39.640
Always clumsy

08:40.080 --> 08:40.600
Such delicate work

08:40.760 --> 08:41.880
I don't know much

08:42.240 --> 08:43.320
you like this you

08:44.120 --> 08:44.640
You come

08:45.360 --> 08:45.840
you pick

08:46.200 --> 08:47.000
I'm going to help Man'er

08:50.360 --> 08:51.000
let me help you

08:51.480 --> 08:53.000
Look, it's weird

08:55.760 --> 08:56.520
fine

08:59.080 --> 08:59.600
Second aunt

09:00.000 --> 09:00.440
Come and help

09:00.600 --> 09:01.480
It won't delay the work at home, right?

09:01.840 --> 09:02.840
Don't let grandma scold you in the end

09:03.240 --> 09:03.640
Won't

09:03.960 --> 09:04.840
Your milk has already said it

09:05.320 --> 09:06.120
As long as I come to help

09:06.360 --> 09:07.360
She gave me stewed chicken

09:14.000 --> 09:14.480
Man'er

09:14.960 --> 09:16.720
Your garlic peanuts are so delicious

09:17.520 --> 09:18.760
What did you do?

09:26.080 --> 09:27.200
Has exclusive formula

09:29.240 --> 09:30.240
What recipe?

09:31.120 --> 09:32.360
I can't tell you that

09:55.200 --> 09:55.600
Second aunt

09:55.840 --> 09:56.640
Bring me the candy

09:57.520 --> 09:58.120
good

09:58.720 --> 09:59.880
Come on

10:00.240 --> 10:01.360
How much to put

10:02.080 --> 10:02.720
you say

10:03.360 --> 10:05.000
So many ingredients

10:05.360 --> 10:06.480
Can you remember it all?

10:07.360 --> 10:08.480
Sometimes I really can’t remember

10:08.720 --> 10:09.240
right

10:09.600 --> 10:10.640
But I wrote it down

10:13.960 --> 10:15.360
There is a recipe for this

10:21.520 --> 10:23.240
Then your prescription is so valuable?

10:23.520 --> 10:24.840
You have to put it away

10:25.720 --> 10:27.480
Don't let anyone steal it

10:28.080 --> 10:28.840
Don't worry, Second Auntie

10:29.320 --> 10:30.120
Just put that recipe

10:30.320 --> 10:30.840
On the left hand side of my house

10:31.080 --> 10:32.240
The third cabinet on the second floor

10:32.720 --> 10:33.720
No one can steal it

10:36.360 --> 10:36.960
Yeah

10:37.320 --> 10:38.320
Just put it away

11:25.640 --> 11:26.480
no

11:36.720 --> 11:38.120
Found it again

11:41.360 --> 11:42.320
is not

12:39.840 --> 12:41.200
Why is the cabinet door open?

12:50.240 --> 12:51.120
Fortunately, I'm on the second floor

12:51.320 --> 12:52.480
The baby I left is still there

13:04.840 --> 13:05.480
Second floor

13:12.480 --> 13:13.720
Found it

13:16.200 --> 13:17.960
Garlic Peanut Recipe

13:20.440 --> 13:22.080
I'm so smart

13:49.480 --> 13:50.240
Your second aunt

13:50.600 --> 13:51.840
I really stole that fake recipe

13:52.120 --> 13:52.880
That's not the case

13:53.480 --> 13:54.200
Fortunately, I saw through it

13:54.360 --> 13:55.200
her little tricks

13:55.360 --> 13:56.600
Used tricks to change pillars

13:57.000 --> 13:58.440
He showed her another way

13:58.720 --> 13:59.360
otherwise

13:59.720 --> 14:00.240
My second aunt

14:00.480 --> 14:01.880
Received the task of my breast

14:02.440 --> 14:03.720
Still unable to steal it

14:03.960 --> 14:05.000
I feel so sad for her

14:06.120 --> 14:06.760
This is not afraid of thieves

14:06.960 --> 14:07.840
I'm afraid that thieves will miss me

14:09.200 --> 14:10.120
A fake recipe

14:10.480 --> 14:11.360
Even if sold

14:11.960 --> 14:12.960
Nothing will happen

14:14.320 --> 14:15.360
You are quite clever

14:16.840 --> 14:17.480
This is called wisdom

14:18.240 --> 14:18.720
Be a good person

14:18.880 --> 14:20.120
Why do you have a long mouth?

14:43.120 --> 14:43.760
Lian Man'er

14:45.840 --> 14:46.840
If one day I leave

14:47.880 --> 14:49.200
Will you always think of me?

14:51.480 --> 14:52.120
You are alone

14:52.320 --> 14:53.120
Where are you going?

14:55.760 --> 14:56.720
I mean if

15:00.360 --> 15:00.840
What do I miss you for?

15:01.240 --> 15:02.000
I want you to tease me

15:03.120 --> 15:04.000
you left

15:04.840 --> 15:06.520
I'll be quiet

15:22.600 --> 15:23.720
Did I say something wrong?

15:24.880 --> 15:25.760
Hurry up and collect the peanuts

15:29.360 --> 15:30.240
Be careful

15:33.360 --> 15:34.480
The weather was fine just now

15:34.840 --> 15:36.080
Why did it suddenly start raining?

15:36.360 --> 15:37.080
Hurry up

15:39.840 --> 15:41.360
Quickly

15:41.720 --> 15:42.480
Be careful with your legs

15:43.240 --> 15:43.880
Be careful, dad

15:56.480 --> 15:57.360
Watch out for your legs

15:58.840 --> 15:59.480
Come

16:14.880 --> 16:16.360
It will be sent to the restaurant tomorrow

16:17.000 --> 16:18.880
But now these peanuts are all wet

16:19.880 --> 16:21.440
It must be too late to make it

16:22.120 --> 16:22.640
These restaurants

16:22.840 --> 16:23.600
It's the first time to cooperate

16:24.240 --> 16:25.480
If it cannot be delivered on time

16:25.760 --> 16:26.360
Eighty percent of them won’t want it

16:26.440 --> 16:27.240
Our peanuts

16:28.640 --> 16:29.200
That

16:29.720 --> 16:31.720
I want to collect one hundred taels of silver in ten days

16:32.000 --> 16:32.840
Wouldn't it be more difficult?

16:33.480 --> 16:34.240
That's not okay

16:35.000 --> 16:36.080
If you can't collect one hundred taels,

16:36.520 --> 16:38.720
Then Man'er is going to jail.

16:40.080 --> 16:40.600
this

17:04.440 --> 17:06.000
Okay, let me go to the restaurant first.

17:06.310 --> 17:07.440
Convince them to wait and see for a few days

17:08.310 --> 17:08.960
etc.

17:11.720 --> 17:12.200
father and mother

17:12.480 --> 17:13.240
You go and borrow some braziers

17:13.800 --> 17:14.440
brazier

17:14.720 --> 17:15.520
what you up to

17:16.720 --> 17:17.800
I couldn't tell clearly for a moment

17:18.160 --> 17:18.920
Anyway, the more the better

17:19.040 --> 17:19.480
good

17:19.880 --> 17:20.960
Shen Nuo went to chop some bamboo.

17:20.960 --> 17:22.310
Go quickly, let's go

17:36.200 --> 17:36.680
look

17:37.000 --> 17:38.560
This is all we have left at home

17:39.280 --> 17:40.280
Isn't there another one?

17:40.520 --> 17:41.520
This is all broken

17:42.040 --> 17:42.480
fine

17:42.720 --> 17:43.200
fine

17:43.440 --> 17:44.000
Can do it

17:44.240 --> 17:44.720
Come, come, come

17:45.000 --> 17:45.960
Then slow down

17:58.800 --> 17:59.480
Sorry to trouble you

17:59.720 --> 18:00.960
I'll send it back to you when I get back

18:01.480 --> 18:02.880
Slow down, it's raining

18:03.040 --> 18:03.760
good

18:08.520 --> 18:09.000
Man'er

18:09.240 --> 18:10.200
Mom borrowed two more braziers

18:10.520 --> 18:11.160
Take a walk

18:11.520 --> 18:12.680
Xiao Qi, please slow down.

19:02.680 --> 19:03.280
OK

19:07.440 --> 19:07.880
daughter

19:08.240 --> 19:08.720
father

19:09.320 --> 19:10.040
Take advantage of this charcoal fire

19:10.760 --> 19:11.680
Let's bake some taro

19:17.080 --> 19:18.000
also

19:51.480 --> 19:52.720
Why are you so hot?

19:54.560 --> 19:55.240
Come to Xiaoqi

19:55.800 --> 19:56.280
Eat first

19:57.800 --> 19:58.480
Such a big potato

19:58.680 --> 19:59.520
It's all baked

20:00.400 --> 20:01.280
I believe so many peanuts

20:01.480 --> 20:02.440
Can also be dried

20:03.760 --> 20:04.560
don't worry

20:06.240 --> 20:06.800
Come

20:07.960 --> 20:08.720
You taste one

20:16.320 --> 20:16.920
thank you

20:35.680 --> 20:36.200
Come

20:36.720 --> 20:37.520
Xiaoqi eats

20:38.440 --> 20:39.680
Be careful not to burn it

20:40.680 --> 20:41.400
Come

20:47.200 --> 20:47.800
do not know either

20:48.480 --> 20:49.480
Let's do this now

20:49.880 --> 20:51.040
Is it too late?

20:54.680 --> 20:55.720
Whether it's too late or not

20:57.280 --> 20:58.400
We have all tried our best

22:00.720 --> 22:02.000
Sister, father and mother

22:02.280 --> 22:03.000
Brother Shen Nuo

22:03.240 --> 22:04.320
Come and see

22:09.720 --> 22:10.480
What's up, Xiaoqi?

22:25.000 --> 22:25.760
Done

22:26.400 --> 22:27.160
All done

22:35.440 --> 22:36.240
Done, done

22:43.480 --> 22:44.240
Shopkeeper Zhang

22:44.280 --> 22:45.480
We follow our previous agreement

22:45.720 --> 22:46.280
Delivered on time

22:46.760 --> 22:48.000
Look at the quality of these peanuts

22:53.520 --> 22:54.760
This tastes good

22:54.920 --> 22:55.720
The shopkeeper's

22:57.000 --> 22:57.480
All tested

22:57.800 --> 22:58.800
Two hundred pounds hanging zero

23:00.040 --> 23:01.520
Wait a moment, those two

23:01.880 --> 23:02.920
I'm going to get the money

23:03.240 --> 23:03.720
Thank you for your hard work

23:03.920 --> 23:04.440
The shopkeeper's

23:05.240 --> 23:07.000
Could you please hurry up a little bit?

23:07.480 --> 23:08.320
We need money urgently

23:08.800 --> 23:09.760
Want to go home quickly

23:10.080 --> 23:10.920
Make another batch of peanuts

23:11.080 --> 23:12.040
Either two

23:12.480 --> 23:13.960
Let's rest in this room for a while.

23:14.240 --> 23:16.160
It's going to rain outside

23:16.520 --> 23:17.520
It's still raining

23:18.560 --> 23:19.440
This can't be the case

23:20.280 --> 23:21.200
Don't believe it

23:21.560 --> 23:23.080
My old cold legs are very accurate.

23:23.480 --> 23:24.200
If it rains

23:24.480 --> 23:25.440
It only hurts for half a moment

23:25.960 --> 23:27.720
But my leg has been hurting for a few days

23:28.200 --> 23:28.760
I guess it’s raining

23:29.200 --> 23:30.720
It has to last for a while

23:31.320 --> 23:32.440
Wait in your room for a while.

23:32.880 --> 23:33.760
Slow down, shopkeeper

23:40.240 --> 23:41.000
If that's the case

23:41.640 --> 23:42.280
It must be too late to make it

23:42.480 --> 23:43.240
So many peanuts

23:44.280 --> 23:45.960
If you need to collect enough one hundred taels of silver,

23:47.040 --> 23:48.440
We have to think of something else

23:50.520 --> 23:51.520
There's only one way left

23:54.480 --> 23:55.440
You don't mean

24:00.200 --> 24:00.720
Eighty taels

24:01.160 --> 24:01.760
What we decided at the time was

24:02.000 --> 24:02.680
One hundred and twenty taels

24:03.680 --> 24:05.400
Today is different from the past

24:06.000 --> 24:07.760
Who can guarantee this garlic peanut

24:08.080 --> 24:09.000
Always hot

24:10.800 --> 24:12.760
Is this recipe of yours genuine?

24:13.160 --> 24:14.000
Of course it's true

24:14.520 --> 24:15.680
why do you ask

24:18.040 --> 24:18.720
nothing

24:19.320 --> 24:20.080
i do

24:20.440 --> 24:21.880
Interested in your recipe

24:23.200 --> 24:24.200
But one hundred taels

24:25.000 --> 24:26.480
I will never come out

24:27.480 --> 24:28.480
Currently selling garlic peanuts

24:28.680 --> 24:29.320
more than one

24:30.000 --> 24:31.560
Everyone said they were the first

24:32.480 --> 24:33.680
But why did you fall in love with it?

24:33.720 --> 24:34.920
Where are our peanuts?

24:35.880 --> 24:36.880
Because for now

24:37.480 --> 24:38.440
Peanuts made at home

24:38.520 --> 24:39.080
The most delicious

24:39.520 --> 24:40.560
Most popular among guests

24:40.880 --> 24:41.640
Yes, shopkeeper Zhang

24:42.080 --> 24:42.920
our peanuts

24:43.080 --> 24:44.400
The market is not generally good

24:44.720 --> 24:45.680
If you don't need money urgently

24:46.080 --> 24:47.400
We will definitely not sell it

24:47.720 --> 24:48.480
Moreover

24:48.480 --> 24:49.200
If you buy

24:49.320 --> 24:50.040
Our recipe

24:50.480 --> 24:52.000
Not only can it be sold in your own restaurant

24:52.400 --> 24:54.080
It can also supply various food shops in the town.

24:54.480 --> 24:55.880
It's less than half a year

24:56.000 --> 24:56.720
This one hundred taels of silver

24:56.920 --> 24:57.560
You can earn it back

24:58.000 --> 24:58.720
Shopkeeper Zhang

24:58.720 --> 24:59.960
This opportunity can't be missed

25:00.480 --> 25:01.560
Time will never come again

25:03.520 --> 25:04.240
That's true

25:04.800 --> 25:05.560
But as a store owner

25:06.080 --> 25:08.080
You have to consider all kinds of risks, right?

25:09.280 --> 25:12.040
This price really can't be any higher

25:19.200 --> 25:19.640
In this case

25:19.760 --> 25:20.440
Forget it

25:23.640 --> 25:24.760
We won't bother you anymore

25:32.080 --> 25:34.080
The shopkeeper really doesn’t want to buy it?

25:35.640 --> 25:36.080
No hurries

25:36.720 --> 25:38.000
They are more anxious than us

25:40.720 --> 25:41.480
Go quickly and don't look back

25:42.200 --> 25:42.720
Then what

25:43.000 --> 25:43.480
Nothing more

25:44.000 --> 25:44.720
no

25:45.640 --> 25:46.520
You don’t want to wait for shopkeeper Zhang

25:46.720 --> 25:47.720
Call us back again

25:48.000 --> 25:48.560
yes

25:49.080 --> 25:50.640
Wouldn't we be able to

25:50.760 --> 25:52.080
Have you taken back the initiative?

25:59.160 --> 25:59.720
You shouldn't

26:00.920 --> 26:01.760
I used to buy things

26:01.960 --> 26:02.440
When using this trick

26:02.560 --> 26:03.480
Tried and proven

26:06.640 --> 26:07.520
Why doesn't it work?

26:21.520 --> 26:22.200
follow me

26:30.440 --> 26:31.520
Need to book ten tables

26:32.400 --> 26:33.000
Sir, please wait a moment

26:33.400 --> 26:34.640
I'm going to call the shopkeeper right away.

26:35.280 --> 26:35.760
The shopkeeper's

26:36.240 --> 26:37.200
There's going to be a big deal

26:37.960 --> 26:38.480
In your gourd

26:38.680 --> 26:39.760
What kind of medicine are they selling?

26:45.160 --> 26:46.560
After a while, you came again and the shopkeeper came.

26:47.160 --> 26:47.880
No matter what we talk about

26:48.480 --> 26:49.440
As long as we have a warm conversation

26:49.720 --> 26:50.680
It's good to have a pleasant conversation

26:51.760 --> 26:52.440
rest assured

26:52.960 --> 26:54.720
I'm good at acting

26:55.640 --> 26:57.480
These ten tables have quite a lot of seats.

26:58.480 --> 26:59.560
May I ask you two?

27:00.040 --> 27:01.680
What kind of banquet is this?

27:03.280 --> 27:03.800
us

27:04.200 --> 27:05.440
Have a wedding banquet

27:06.800 --> 27:07.320
right

27:07.800 --> 27:08.320
us

27:09.240 --> 27:10.240
There's a wedding banquet coming up

27:12.160 --> 27:14.720
There might even be a wedding banquet for the children.

27:16.040 --> 27:16.520
The shopkeeper's

27:16.960 --> 27:18.200
Do you want to make more concessions?

27:20.400 --> 27:21.000
Shopkeeper

27:21.640 --> 27:23.000
How can this wedding banquet be enough?

27:23.280 --> 27:24.480
I’m watching this full-moon wine and 100-day banquet

27:24.680 --> 27:25.560
Everything has to be put on the agenda

27:26.040 --> 27:26.560
Otherwise

27:27.240 --> 27:28.240
Give me your sixtieth birthday

27:28.480 --> 27:29.440
It's all done in advance

27:29.920 --> 27:30.720
What do you think?

27:32.080 --> 27:33.440
Brother Bao

27:33.760 --> 27:35.000
Why are you so good at talking?

27:35.160 --> 27:35.960
I'm even shy

27:41.480 --> 27:42.640
like you

27:45.560 --> 27:46.720
like you

27:47.000 --> 27:48.720
A young couple who came to book a table in person

27:49.880 --> 27:51.240
It’s really rare

27:53.240 --> 27:54.080
Me and my baby brother

27:54.400 --> 27:56.640
I grew up in a village

27:57.880 --> 28:00.160
Childhood sweethearts and childhood sweethearts

28:01.000 --> 28:01.520
Is this a marriage?

28:01.760 --> 28:03.240
The two families have already agreed

28:03.520 --> 28:04.520
So it’s not so particular

28:05.000 --> 28:05.720
Right, Brother Bao?

28:06.320 --> 28:07.200
That's natural

28:08.320 --> 28:09.000
The shopkeeper's

28:09.200 --> 28:10.680
So what kind of dishes do you have here?

28:11.200 --> 28:11.880
What dish?

28:29.080 --> 28:29.520
The shopkeeper's

28:30.080 --> 28:30.640
The shopkeeper's

28:31.520 --> 28:32.640
The shopkeeper's fault is bad

28:32.760 --> 28:33.440
Something big happened

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
I just saw it

28:35.720 --> 28:36.880
Miss Lian and Mr. Shen

28:36.880 --> 28:37.880
Want that recipe

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
After selling it, you came to the restaurant again

28:39.920 --> 28:40.520
you heard

28:41.480 --> 28:42.160
did not hear

28:42.720 --> 28:43.400
roll roll roll

28:43.520 --> 28:44.680
I'm not the shopkeeper. Listen to me.

28:45.000 --> 28:45.800
The two of them followed

28:46.480 --> 28:47.520
Jun came again to chat with the shopkeeper.

28:47.760 --> 28:48.680
Very happy

28:51.440 --> 28:52.480
Then why are you still leaving it here?

28:53.000 --> 28:53.440
Don't hurry up yet

28:53.480 --> 28:54.160
Find me the person

28:54.480 --> 28:54.960
Go

28:55.280 --> 28:56.560
I'm going to go right now

29:03.040 --> 29:03.760
Shopkeeper Zhang

29:04.480 --> 29:05.440
Don’t you think it’s expensive?

29:06.040 --> 29:07.320
Why did you change your mind?

29:07.720 --> 29:09.240
You, please stop making fun of me

29:09.720 --> 29:10.680
I don’t think so too

29:11.040 --> 29:12.480
Can I save a little?

29:13.440 --> 29:15.000
You two can have some refreshments first.

29:15.320 --> 29:16.720
I'm going to draw up a contract right now

29:17.000 --> 29:18.400
Let's pay with one hand

29:18.920 --> 29:19.720
hand in hand

29:28.200 --> 29:28.880
It’s done

29:40.320 --> 29:41.880
Thank you for your hard work, Brother Nuo.

29:44.640 --> 29:45.720
Come on guys

29:45.880 --> 29:47.720
Give me an old lady a review

29:47.960 --> 29:49.920
Look at such a big restaurant

29:50.280 --> 29:51.440
Reluctant to give money

29:51.680 --> 29:53.160
If he doesn't give me money today,

29:53.240 --> 29:54.720
I'm not done with him, my mother

29:54.880 --> 29:56.200
I showed this recipe to the chef

29:57.040 --> 29:57.880
In this garlic peanut

29:58.040 --> 29:59.000
There must be fennel

29:59.240 --> 30:00.560
But it’s not in your prescription.

30:00.960 --> 30:01.760
If not, it’s fake

30:02.320 --> 30:03.480
How can I pay you if you are fake?

30:03.520 --> 30:04.760
Our recipes are all passed down from our ancestors.

30:04.760 --> 30:05.720
How could it be fake

30:06.520 --> 30:07.240
Did you read it?

30:07.240 --> 30:08.080
You have to pay if you see it

30:08.240 --> 30:09.080
Walk

30:10.000 --> 30:11.440
No wonder shopkeeper Zhang asked you

30:11.720 --> 30:12.920
Is this recipe true or false?

30:13.160 --> 30:14.160
You have to pay if you see it

30:17.000 --> 30:17.880
daughter

30:18.800 --> 30:19.280
daughter

30:19.280 --> 30:20.240
I am fifty-eight years old

30:20.480 --> 30:21.800
kind old woman

30:22.000 --> 30:23.440
You bully me like this

30:23.520 --> 30:24.240
big girl

30:24.240 --> 30:25.520
I'm still one year older than you

30:25.520 --> 30:26.240
What are you

30:30.880 --> 30:32.320
My girl

30:32.880 --> 30:34.400
I told you before

30:34.520 --> 30:36.440
Be careful of these profiteers cheating

30:36.640 --> 30:37.040
You still don’t believe it

30:37.040 --> 30:37.720
daughter

30:37.720 --> 30:38.440
give money

30:38.440 --> 30:39.040
daughter

30:39.480 --> 30:40.560
Mom, don’t go there, Mom

30:40.880 --> 30:43.640
I can’t live anymore, mother.

30:43.960 --> 30:47.000
I returned to my mother by riding a crane to the west.

30:47.280 --> 30:48.720
I don’t live anymore, grandma

30:49.000 --> 30:49.640
Second uncle’s mother Second uncle

30:49.800 --> 30:50.720
Why are you here?

30:51.000 --> 30:51.680
Man'er

30:52.160 --> 30:52.800
You came just in time

30:53.480 --> 30:54.080
Let me tell you

30:54.480 --> 30:55.160
This restaurant

30:55.320 --> 30:56.480
The recipe that deceived our Lian family

30:56.960 --> 30:57.760
And beat people

30:58.480 --> 30:59.240
Milk

31:00.240 --> 31:00.880
The shopkeeper's

31:01.240 --> 31:01.960
You bully my grandma

31:02.080 --> 31:02.920
I won't agree

31:03.040 --> 31:04.000
I I'm not

31:04.240 --> 31:04.720
Milk you up

31:04.920 --> 31:05.400
Report to the official

31:05.560 --> 31:06.240
Come

31:07.040 --> 31:08.680
Get up, get up slowly, get up slowly

31:08.720 --> 31:09.800
Be careful with your breasts

31:10.160 --> 31:11.080
Our recipe is fake

31:11.480 --> 31:12.880
But it’s true that they beat people

31:13.080 --> 31:13.440
right

31:13.440 --> 31:14.640
There are so many of us watching

31:15.080 --> 31:16.640
We let him walk around without food

31:16.880 --> 31:17.520
Walk around

31:17.640 --> 31:18.240
Carrying around

31:19.720 --> 31:20.240
Wait a minute

31:21.440 --> 31:22.680
The prescription is fake

31:24.680 --> 31:25.720
impossible

31:25.920 --> 31:27.040
That's what I've been through

31:27.200 --> 31:28.080
Second Auntie is on the left side of my house

31:28.320 --> 31:29.040
The second cabinet

31:29.240 --> 31:31.000
Taken secretly from the third drawer

31:32.200 --> 31:33.160
You damn girl

31:33.400 --> 31:34.000
Are you cheating on me?

31:35.480 --> 31:36.200
Grandma Lian

31:36.720 --> 31:37.640
In this public place

31:37.880 --> 31:38.480
Keep making trouble

31:38.920 --> 31:40.280
If someone from the government sees it

31:40.680 --> 31:41.920
But it won't end well

31:43.520 --> 31:44.880
It’s all because of these flowers.

31:45.040 --> 31:45.760
Bad idea

31:46.160 --> 31:47.480
I'll go back and take good care of her

31:47.960 --> 31:49.320
I told you to listen carefully

31:49.720 --> 31:51.240
Even if this recipe is fake

31:51.480 --> 31:52.880
I also make trouble with you. I make trouble every day.

31:53.000 --> 31:53.920
I made a fuss

31:54.800 --> 31:56.000
Brother Yamen

31:56.240 --> 31:57.280
What kind of government officer?

31:57.480 --> 31:58.000
daughter

31:58.240 --> 31:59.320
There is still life in our fields

31:59.640 --> 32:00.280
Yes, there is still work to do

32:01.560 --> 32:02.640
I'm here to make trouble

32:02.680 --> 32:04.480
I will come to the door every day to make trouble with you

32:04.680 --> 32:06.080
Empress, empress, come, come

32:08.240 --> 32:08.920
what happened

32:11.320 --> 32:12.240
No, no, no

32:12.560 --> 32:13.280
Just

32:13.320 --> 32:14.160
several guests

32:16.160 --> 32:16.800
The fight started

32:17.080 --> 32:17.560
yes

32:17.720 --> 32:19.040
It's okay, let's go, let's go

32:19.040 --> 32:20.280
It's okay already

32:20.760 --> 32:22.000
Nothing happened, everything is over

32:22.440 --> 32:22.920
fine

32:23.160 --> 32:23.640
girl

32:24.560 --> 32:25.240
Let's go

32:25.320 --> 32:26.000
Gone, gone

32:26.880 --> 32:27.640
It's all gone, it's all gone

32:27.800 --> 32:28.480
It's okay, it's okay

32:29.000 --> 32:30.240
It's time to eat and drink.

32:30.640 --> 32:31.080
fine

32:31.320 --> 32:32.240
It's time to eat and drink.

32:32.560 --> 32:33.280
I just couldn't bear it

32:33.760 --> 32:35.080
It's time to eat and drink.

32:35.800 --> 32:36.680
Inappropriate greeting Inappropriate greeting

32:36.920 --> 32:37.720
walk you slowly

32:38.960 --> 32:39.880
It's okay, it's okay

32:49.240 --> 32:50.040
This matter now

32:50.160 --> 32:50.920
Finally solved

32:51.040 --> 32:51.960
Where is my life?

32:51.960 --> 32:52.560
It’s considered saved.

32:53.440 --> 32:54.720
But this recipe was sold

32:55.080 --> 32:56.000
I have to think of other things quickly.

32:56.000 --> 32:56.880
ways to make money

32:57.920 --> 32:58.480
Man'er

32:59.720 --> 33:00.240
Brother Youheng

33:02.440 --> 33:03.560
I've been borrowing money from various places these days

33:04.480 --> 33:05.240
Finally got enough

33:06.880 --> 33:07.480
No

33:08.280 --> 33:08.960
why

33:09.720 --> 33:10.640
Just now Lian Maner

33:10.960 --> 33:11.920
Garlic peanut recipe

33:12.160 --> 33:12.800
sold

33:13.240 --> 33:14.000
I have enough money

33:15.240 --> 33:16.000
You sold the recipe

33:17.040 --> 33:17.520
That

33:17.960 --> 33:18.920
Can I redeem it again?

33:23.320 --> 33:24.080
If I could

33:24.880 --> 33:26.000
It would be better if it were faster

33:26.920 --> 33:27.880
It's okay, look

33:28.000 --> 33:28.720
I don't have to go to jail

33:28.880 --> 33:30.000
It’s great that you don’t have to dig for salt.

33:33.080 --> 33:35.680
Pay the tax tomorrow on the 15th

33:36.000 --> 33:36.920
I'll be fine

33:38.000 --> 33:38.520
let me tell you

33:39.080 --> 33:40.080
My milk today

33:40.680 --> 33:41.720
My second aunt and uncle

33:41.760 --> 33:42.640
It's embarrassing to be in a restaurant

33:42.920 --> 33:43.680
Lian Man'er

33:52.280 --> 33:52.880
You want it tomorrow

33:53.040 --> 33:53.720
I went to the Yamen to pay the money.

33:54.680 --> 33:55.440
can you do it alone

33:55.920 --> 33:56.560
all right

33:58.160 --> 33:58.920
Are you alright

34:00.960 --> 34:01.560
nothing

34:02.320 --> 34:03.080
Just not for restaurants

34:03.320 --> 34:03.920
Peanuts are available

34:04.560 --> 34:06.600
I'll at least go and let you know.

34:18.150 --> 34:18.760
Let's go

34:20.670 --> 34:22.520
Then they wanted to make that recipe

34:22.800 --> 34:23.600
Sold to a restaurant owner

34:25.080 --> 34:25.920
Which recipe

34:26.360 --> 34:27.920
This is the recipe for garlic peanuts.

34:28.190 --> 34:29.600
But actually that recipe is fake

34:29.840 --> 34:30.400
Fake

35:12.400 --> 35:17.600
Tell sir not to ask for it

35:19.560 --> 35:25.800
Worry about everything

35:28.160 --> 35:33.000
I treat you like a girl

35:34.560 --> 35:37.160
Not looking for money, not looking for money

35:37.400 --> 35:39.760
A picture of you alone is enough

35:40.040 --> 35:42.960
A picture of you alone is enough

35:43.080 --> 35:45.600
Poor days and rough food

35:46.080 --> 35:49.800
Don’t talk about consistency

35:57.760 --> 35:58.160
Miss

35:58.160 --> 35:59.680
Your rouge is so pretty

36:00.520 --> 36:01.760
Come, come, miss, go, go

36:02.200 --> 36:03.800
Thank you for being so polite

36:06.280 --> 36:07.280
The stage over there

36:08.040 --> 36:08.960
It must be wonderful

36:11.040 --> 36:11.840
Go over and have a look

36:22.640 --> 36:23.480
what are you doing here

36:25.040 --> 36:25.800
There is a meeting in the Song family

36:25.960 --> 36:26.720
You didn't even tell me

36:27.640 --> 36:28.880
Missed such a good business opportunity

36:29.160 --> 36:30.040
But it’s a loss

36:31.480 --> 36:32.600
How did you get in without an invitation?

36:33.480 --> 36:34.040
Use peanuts

36:34.480 --> 36:35.760
Bribed them to come in

36:38.680 --> 36:39.200
Walk

36:40.560 --> 36:41.000
where to

36:41.320 --> 36:42.160
Go back quickly

36:44.480 --> 36:45.480
Drive me away in such a hurry

36:46.040 --> 36:46.640
what do you want to do

36:47.560 --> 36:48.680
If I shouldn’t ask you, don’t ask.

36:49.400 --> 36:50.760
If you don't tell me, I won't leave.

36:56.480 --> 36:57.200
I'm coming to Song Mansion today

36:57.320 --> 36:58.680
It's to take something very important

36:59.560 --> 37:00.280
I can't guarantee

37:00.280 --> 37:01.120
what happens in a while

37:01.760 --> 37:03.360
But if you don't leave, what if something happens?

37:04.520 --> 37:06.000
I don't have time to protect you

37:08.080 --> 37:08.600
Walk

37:09.640 --> 37:10.360
Go back quickly

38:04.880 --> 38:05.480
what's the situation

38:05.880 --> 38:06.480
Where is the accounting office?

38:06.960 --> 38:07.680
backyard west wing

38:08.080 --> 38:09.120
When they set up the stage before,

38:09.400 --> 38:10.000
I've touched it

38:10.600 --> 38:11.040
good

38:11.480 --> 38:12.200
Be sure to get it today

38:13.080 --> 38:14.160
As long as we get the books

38:14.440 --> 38:15.000
You can leave as soon as possible

38:15.120 --> 38:15.840
Jinyang County

38:19.040 --> 38:19.680
What's wrong

38:21.600 --> 38:22.120
fine

38:22.880 --> 38:24.200
Everyone in the mansion is watching a show right now

38:24.480 --> 38:25.320
Let's move faster

38:25.800 --> 38:26.480
Good to go

39:38.880 --> 39:39.880
Before the meeting

39:40.400 --> 39:41.520
I saw with my own eyes that Song’s parents followed

39:41.680 --> 39:43.000
He took the books and entered the accounting room.

39:43.520 --> 39:44.640
When I went out, I was empty-handed.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.280
Why can't I find it now?

40:42.200 --> 40:43.200
Finished singing so quickly

40:43.760 --> 40:44.360
don't worry

40:44.760 --> 40:45.880
Wait a minute, there will be a new drama.

40:46.440 --> 40:47.360
You must see it

40:48.000 --> 40:49.160
Why don't you go take a look around the backyard first?

40:49.400 --> 40:50.120
It's not too late to come back

40:50.480 --> 40:51.520
walk walk walk

40:51.680 --> 40:52.320
good

40:57.880 --> 40:58.520
backyard

40:59.600 --> 41:00.680
You won't be caught, right?

41:14.040 --> 41:15.040
Oh my god

41:17.320 --> 41:17.920
Do business

41:38.320 --> 41:38.920
do not move

41:40.480 --> 41:41.200
There is an agency

41:43.360 --> 41:44.360
Hurry up and stop grinding

41:44.840 --> 41:46.120
I know it's coming, it's coming

41:55.680 --> 41:57.320
Take a look

41:57.920 --> 41:59.000
I'll just say it's a fat sheep.

41:59.320 --> 41:59.960
You still don’t believe it

42:00.800 --> 42:02.000
Now we can build a big house

42:02.280 --> 42:02.840
Third brother

42:03.160 --> 42:04.280
What's so good about building a house?

42:04.600 --> 42:06.120
The village is not big enough for you to live in

42:06.280 --> 42:08.000
If you ask me, it’s better to marry your wife

42:08.480 --> 42:10.120
Is it okay for a wife to have a big house?

42:10.360 --> 42:11.160
Build a house

42:11.600 --> 42:12.880
It is easier to find a wife than to build a house

42:13.000 --> 42:13.560
Build a house

42:13.760 --> 42:14.200
marry a wife

42:14.360 --> 42:14.840
build a big house

42:14.960 --> 42:15.320
marry a wife

42:15.480 --> 42:16.480
Build a big house and shut up.

42:19.040 --> 42:19.680
I don’t want people outside to

42:19.840 --> 42:20.480
heard all

42:22.440 --> 42:23.040
Take action

42:35.000 --> 42:35.440
eldest sister

42:35.480 --> 42:36.840
Mi Douzi brought it

42:38.840 --> 42:39.480
Young Master

42:39.800 --> 42:41.640
The next drama will have to wait a while.

42:42.040 --> 42:43.280
Gentlemen, don't be anxious first.

42:43.520 --> 42:44.520
Let's have some tea first

42:46.280 --> 42:47.080
we wait

42:52.600 --> 42:53.320
Here it comes

42:53.320 --> 42:54.080
Why so fast

42:54.520 --> 42:55.360
so fast

43:19.800 --> 43:21.560
Dear fellow citizens,

43:21.960 --> 43:22.880
Let's go next

43:22.880 --> 43:24.320
I will bring you one

43:24.520 --> 43:27.920
The new play is called Hao Han Play

43:28.400 --> 43:29.000
hope everyone

43:29.400 --> 43:31.400
You can sing with us

43:31.560 --> 43:32.120
Yes or no

43:32.440 --> 43:33.080
Sing together

43:33.680 --> 43:34.160
Come

43:34.960 --> 43:37.800
The river flows eastward

43:37.880 --> 43:40.520
The stars in the sky join the Beidou

43:41.560 --> 43:42.920
Beidou

43:43.040 --> 43:45.120
A bowl of wine between life and death

43:45.560 --> 43:46.640
Come, everyone, join me

43:47.120 --> 43:49.680
The river flows eastward

43:50.000 --> 43:52.120
The stars in the sky join the Beidou

43:52.320 --> 43:53.440
here we go

43:55.800 --> 43:56.840
Take a look

43:57.160 --> 43:57.560
Walk

44:06.280 --> 44:06.760
eldest sister

44:17.320 --> 44:17.920
Not as good as

44:18.480 --> 44:19.920
Just stay in our Shengde class

44:20.160 --> 44:21.840
It’s your Song family that I’m robbing

44:35.000 --> 44:35.640
who
