01:59.190 --> 01:59.670
Xiaoqi

02:00.190 --> 02:00.630
A letter for you to send

02:00.670 --> 02:01.670
You didn't deliver it, did you?

02:02.070 --> 02:03.430
Leave it to the salesman

02:03.670 --> 02:04.990
Will give it to grandma and grandpa

02:07.670 --> 02:08.830
We are going to separate today

02:09.669 --> 02:10.669
Should have come long ago

02:16.790 --> 02:17.710
Third brother

02:18.430 --> 02:19.550
continuous belief

02:19.990 --> 02:20.990
with the head of the family

02:21.990 --> 02:22.829
Lianfang

02:23.710 --> 02:24.870
Inconvenient to live together

02:25.950 --> 02:27.510
Want to separate now

03:39.670 --> 03:40.110
daughter

03:41.710 --> 03:42.950
How much should I give to the third child?

03:43.790 --> 03:44.390
one acre of land

03:44.950 --> 03:45.990
One chicken and one duck

03:46.110 --> 03:46.710
one acre

03:47.110 --> 03:47.950
Not mother

03:48.270 --> 03:49.270
That moment was right

03:49.390 --> 03:50.430
To provide circumstantial evidence

03:50.550 --> 03:51.270
you you

03:51.430 --> 03:52.950
Isn't this too ugly?

03:53.350 --> 03:53.950
Too little

03:54.710 --> 03:55.950
Give your wife’s dowry

03:56.110 --> 03:56.829
Supply the third child

03:58.150 --> 03:58.990
Look at you

04:00.110 --> 04:00.870
OK OK OK

04:01.390 --> 04:02.870
Your Majesty, everything you said is right.

04:02.990 --> 04:03.510
We are all

04:04.670 --> 04:06.110
Who are those at the entrance of this village?

04:06.510 --> 04:07.390
Scary to death

04:07.990 --> 04:08.990
Isn't that Lian Fang's in-laws?

04:10.110 --> 04:12.030
Lian Fang, your relatives are here

04:16.589 --> 04:17.350
Mom, let me go there

04:20.110 --> 04:20.910
It's broken, it's broken

04:30.230 --> 04:30.590
Xiaoqi

04:30.590 --> 04:31.150
grandma grandpa

04:31.230 --> 04:32.230
First uncle, second uncle and third uncle

04:32.350 --> 04:33.030
Let uncle hug you

04:33.710 --> 04:34.550
Grow taller again

04:34.830 --> 04:35.390
Do you miss your third uncle?

04:35.590 --> 04:36.030
think

04:36.350 --> 04:37.350
Come, come, uncle, give me a hug

04:37.550 --> 04:37.830
Come

04:40.030 --> 04:41.230
Grow so tall

04:41.390 --> 04:42.230
Grandpa

04:42.670 --> 04:43.230
Man'er

04:44.270 --> 04:44.790
grandma

04:49.030 --> 04:49.909
Man'er

04:54.470 --> 04:55.230
wronged

04:58.230 --> 04:58.710
Not wronged

04:59.150 --> 05:00.830
Come and take me to see your mother

05:05.350 --> 05:05.910
Brother

05:06.470 --> 05:06.910
relatives by marriage

05:07.670 --> 05:08.470
in-laws in-laws

05:10.150 --> 05:11.030
The boss, the second and the third

05:11.350 --> 05:12.030
move things in

05:12.550 --> 05:13.030
and some mud

05:13.590 --> 05:14.150
Put that wall around

05:14.270 --> 05:15.030
And the kitchen stove

05:15.350 --> 05:16.150
Build it all up

05:16.350 --> 05:16.790
Okay daddy

05:16.990 --> 05:17.590
Take a walk

05:17.710 --> 05:18.470
The second oldest and the third oldest are leaving.

05:19.150 --> 05:19.790
This this

05:19.830 --> 05:20.350
Brother

05:20.910 --> 05:22.270
I'm here to see my daughter

05:22.390 --> 05:23.390
Bring her something by the way

05:24.470 --> 05:24.910
Nana

05:25.670 --> 05:26.830
Let's sit in the room

05:26.830 --> 05:27.350
Not in a hurry

05:27.830 --> 05:29.470
I heard you had a bumper harvest this year

05:30.030 --> 05:30.990
Can you take me to see it?

05:31.150 --> 05:32.350
I want to be a little happy

05:34.590 --> 05:35.909
They're all in the barn

05:36.470 --> 05:37.390
I'll take you to have a look

05:37.470 --> 05:37.830
Walk

05:39.470 --> 05:40.350
work on your businesses

05:47.150 --> 05:47.909
second wife

05:50.230 --> 05:50.390
What's wrong

05:50.390 --> 05:51.150
second wife

05:51.350 --> 05:52.790
What didn't you see?

05:53.350 --> 05:53.909
What did you see?

05:54.230 --> 05:54.670
At once

05:56.909 --> 05:57.550
Saw

05:57.909 --> 05:58.909
You mean the third wife?

05:59.550 --> 06:00.790
Here comes a whole bunch of family members

06:01.030 --> 06:02.150
Why haven't you seen this before?

06:02.270 --> 06:03.150
Such a big battle?

06:03.590 --> 06:04.590
No need to ask

06:05.150 --> 06:07.150
It must be for that mourning star lady

06:07.590 --> 06:08.350
Support is coming

06:08.390 --> 06:08.910
Yes

06:09.150 --> 06:10.550
She is bullying me and there is no one left in my family.

06:10.990 --> 06:11.670
Not good

06:11.910 --> 06:12.390
Go quickly

06:12.790 --> 06:13.990
Call the people from that village

06:14.110 --> 06:15.590
Comment on your mother

06:17.150 --> 06:17.710
go quickly

06:17.830 --> 06:18.830
Wait a minute, mother

06:19.110 --> 06:20.470
It's your own family's business

06:20.710 --> 06:22.110
Why do you want others to judge?

06:22.470 --> 06:23.670
Family scandals should not be made public

06:24.230 --> 06:25.150
You call people over

06:25.590 --> 06:26.390
Mom will make this big pot for you

06:26.470 --> 06:27.110
braised chicken

06:27.790 --> 06:28.350
a big pot

06:32.470 --> 06:33.790
Look at you

06:39.390 --> 06:40.710
How honest is the third child?

06:40.909 --> 06:42.030
Make the old man so angry

06:42.790 --> 06:43.350
yes

06:43.470 --> 06:45.030
How did it become like this?

06:45.030 --> 06:45.670
How honest he was before

06:45.710 --> 06:47.030
There are so many other things

06:47.110 --> 06:48.150
If it weren't for you,

06:48.230 --> 06:49.790
How could I know so many things?

06:49.790 --> 06:50.590
But no

06:51.110 --> 06:51.550
yes

06:51.710 --> 06:52.350
let me tell you

06:52.710 --> 06:54.350
How do I get this thing to take the lead?

06:54.590 --> 06:55.350
heartbroken

06:55.790 --> 06:56.030
unlucky

06:56.150 --> 06:56.909
Seeking death and survival

06:56.990 --> 06:57.590
Tell you

06:57.909 --> 06:58.990
I heard he was the one from the Lian family

07:02.230 --> 07:02.910
My braised chicken

07:04.230 --> 07:06.030
Braised Chicken Braised Chicken Braised Chicken

07:06.470 --> 07:06.910
Fight

07:07.710 --> 07:08.230
What are you muttering about?

07:08.470 --> 07:09.470
You do your job

07:10.390 --> 07:11.030
Yes

07:17.550 --> 07:18.710
The in-laws are here

07:19.590 --> 07:21.150
What are we talking about? Are you so happy?

07:21.590 --> 07:23.590
My sister-in-law, you came just in time.

07:23.830 --> 07:24.350
Isn't that right?

07:24.670 --> 07:25.830
Let’s talk about our family affairs.

07:28.230 --> 07:28.990
You

07:29.270 --> 07:31.590
He has little contact with our Lian family

07:32.030 --> 07:32.990
It's about my family

07:33.230 --> 07:34.390
I need to say a few words

07:37.230 --> 07:37.710
right

07:40.230 --> 07:42.270
You don’t know?

07:42.670 --> 07:44.670
Ever since the third child in my family said we wanted to separate the family

07:46.230 --> 07:47.030
The second oldest person in the family

07:47.350 --> 07:48.790
Washing my face with tears every day

07:49.230 --> 07:51.230
Crying and begging the third child not to move out

07:51.590 --> 07:52.270
But where is the third child?

07:52.670 --> 07:54.230
After eating the weight, I became determined.

07:55.110 --> 07:55.590
Say it again

07:56.230 --> 07:58.270
How can any of my parents still be alive?

07:58.790 --> 08:00.230
I'm going to break up with my family.

08:00.670 --> 08:02.390
It's really a crime

08:02.470 --> 08:03.270
This won't work

08:03.590 --> 08:04.910
But then again

08:05.350 --> 08:06.150
That matter of family separation

08:06.670 --> 08:07.910
What does the third child know?

08:08.550 --> 08:09.910
My wife didn’t teach me

08:10.150 --> 08:11.230
It’s just that my wife doesn’t teach me

08:11.350 --> 08:13.470
How can a man disobey his parents?

08:13.910 --> 08:16.350
Even the second elder in the family is quite pitiful.

08:16.470 --> 08:17.470
Pitiful

08:17.790 --> 08:18.790
It's pitiful

08:19.230 --> 08:20.110
Pity my sister

08:20.230 --> 08:21.910
When I was pregnant with Xiaoqi

08:22.470 --> 08:24.030
Have to work in the fields every day

08:24.670 --> 08:25.830
Counting nine cold days

08:26.190 --> 08:27.950
I still have to wash clothes and cook for my mother-in-law.

08:28.430 --> 08:30.310
Now I am pregnant with Xiaoba and I fell down.

08:30.630 --> 08:31.950
It doesn’t matter if the child is gone

08:32.110 --> 08:33.070
She is walking through the gate of hell

08:33.070 --> 08:33.830
When I'm on the edge

08:34.110 --> 08:34.830
This is for mother-in-law

08:35.230 --> 08:36.590
Don't even buy her a medicine

08:37.110 --> 08:38.830
Let her fend for herself

08:39.429 --> 08:40.470
This and other things

08:40.710 --> 08:42.710
The two elders of the Lian family are not human beings.

08:42.830 --> 08:44.110
even so

08:44.710 --> 08:46.070
Then we can't separate the families.

08:46.630 --> 08:47.510
Let me tell you

08:48.470 --> 08:49.750
It's been planned for a long time

08:50.710 --> 08:51.590
The matter of family separation

08:51.830 --> 08:52.830
But the fourth girl Lian Maner

08:52.950 --> 08:54.110
Talk about it every day

08:54.590 --> 08:55.070
That's not even a mention

08:55.190 --> 08:56.190
Once or twice

08:56.710 --> 08:58.110
This time I'm just borrowing

08:58.230 --> 08:59.710
The reason for the miscarriage of the third brother and sister

09:00.350 --> 09:01.990
Forcing the second elder to nod

09:03.230 --> 09:03.990
That's it

09:05.830 --> 09:08.510
Every family has scriptures that are difficult to recite.

09:08.830 --> 09:09.830
I know it's not easy

09:11.430 --> 09:12.470
Everyone knows

09:12.870 --> 09:15.230
Our family is not rich to begin with

09:15.990 --> 09:17.590
Asking for scientific examination for the eldest son

09:18.070 --> 09:19.230
Pull the whole family together in the future

09:20.110 --> 09:21.470
Money for my daughter-in-law’s medical treatment

09:21.830 --> 09:22.710
It’s not that I won’t take it

09:23.230 --> 09:24.830
I can't take it out

09:25.190 --> 09:26.070
I we know

09:26.230 --> 09:27.110
Understand, understand, understand

09:27.310 --> 09:27.990
people say

09:28.830 --> 09:29.590
Take care of one person

09:30.110 --> 09:31.230
Or take care of the whole family

09:32.110 --> 09:32.830
second elder

09:34.710 --> 09:36.110
How difficult

09:36.110 --> 09:38.110
Isn't it? It's not easy.

09:38.430 --> 09:40.430
It’s really not easy even for the second oldest person in the family.

09:40.470 --> 09:40.870
Not easy

09:42.230 --> 09:43.590
Don’t mention it to your in-laws

09:43.710 --> 09:44.990
I actually forgot

09:45.350 --> 09:46.230
Your eldest brother

09:46.430 --> 09:48.110
How much money did the family spend?

09:48.590 --> 09:49.470
Let the whole family

09:49.630 --> 09:51.470
Don’t talk about tightening your belt and living a good life

09:51.990 --> 09:52.990
Still making up my mind now

09:53.230 --> 09:54.830
It hit me, Maner.

09:55.710 --> 09:56.870
This shameless Lian Shouren

09:56.870 --> 09:57.750
And Na Gushi

09:58.230 --> 09:58.990
Give it to our family

09:58.990 --> 09:59.750
What kind of marriage is arranged?

09:59.870 --> 10:00.870
Want me to give some to my sister too?

10:00.950 --> 10:01.470
Nagging?

10:01.630 --> 10:02.710
tell us

10:03.190 --> 10:04.110
Look, look, look

10:04.350 --> 10:05.230
That's what you said

10:05.590 --> 10:06.470
How many rooms does anyone have?

10:06.470 --> 10:07.470
No bumps or bruises

10:07.590 --> 10:08.630
Who hasn't had any quarrels yet?

10:08.750 --> 10:10.430
Who doesn’t have enough time to celebrate the festival?

10:10.590 --> 10:11.190
Want them all to look like

10:11.510 --> 10:12.870
Your sister is like your niece

10:13.110 --> 10:14.470
When there is a quarrel, we break up.

10:14.710 --> 10:15.710
When there is a quarrel, we break up.

10:15.870 --> 10:17.750
Are the ancestral tablets still available?

10:17.990 --> 10:19.230
I can't live this day anymore

10:23.230 --> 10:23.590
yes

10:24.230 --> 10:25.710
Why did it fall down?

10:26.230 --> 10:27.190
Really are

10:34.710 --> 10:35.830
You said my brain

10:36.110 --> 10:37.510
There is still soup simmering at home.

10:37.750 --> 10:38.830
I just forgot

10:40.590 --> 10:40.870
sister

10:41.470 --> 10:42.710
Let’s talk another day

10:42.990 --> 10:43.710
Let’s talk another day

10:43.830 --> 10:44.310
Stop it

10:44.470 --> 10:45.110
I'm about to arrive

10:45.110 --> 10:46.110
Are you going to your in-laws’ house?

10:46.350 --> 10:47.110
Let's go for a walk together

10:47.230 --> 10:47.950
You don't

10:48.070 --> 10:49.990
You walk there slowly and leisurely

10:50.230 --> 10:51.350
I'm in a hurry for my soup

10:51.510 --> 10:52.230
Stop it

10:52.590 --> 10:54.470
Hurry up and stop catching fire

10:57.750 --> 10:58.950
you silly boy

11:00.310 --> 11:01.590
Such a big thing happened

11:01.990 --> 11:02.590
Why don't you know?

11:02.710 --> 11:03.950
Let your family know

11:05.830 --> 11:06.590
If it weren't for Man'er

11:06.750 --> 11:08.230
Send me this message

11:09.230 --> 11:10.710
My mother is still kept in the dark

11:11.510 --> 11:13.590
Are you trying to feel sorry for your mother?

11:15.230 --> 11:15.990
I am

11:17.190 --> 11:18.350
Afraid of worrying my mother

11:18.510 --> 11:19.230
Afraid of mother worrying

11:19.430 --> 11:20.710
Look at you now

11:22.230 --> 11:24.830
So thin that there is only a handful of bones left

11:28.750 --> 11:29.990
I am the daughter of the Zhang family

11:30.630 --> 11:31.990
so bullied

11:32.470 --> 11:32.950
spread the word

11:32.990 --> 11:34.190
Where to put my face

11:35.310 --> 11:36.470
It’s all my mother’s fault

11:37.750 --> 11:40.710
Always teach you to be gentle and filial

11:41.590 --> 11:42.710
Heart for heart

11:44.310 --> 11:45.630
I thought even my family

11:45.830 --> 11:47.230
It should be reasonable

11:48.750 --> 11:49.070
did not expect

11:49.230 --> 11:51.070
You suffered such a big loss

11:59.110 --> 11:59.590
daughter

12:04.230 --> 12:05.070
Mother

12:05.430 --> 12:06.990
Isn't this good for me?

12:09.870 --> 12:11.230
For his dad's sake

12:12.750 --> 12:13.830
Don't make it too tense

12:16.470 --> 12:17.590
grandma

12:18.590 --> 12:20.630
Daddy is tough this time

12:21.070 --> 12:22.350
No matter how much grandpa and grandma cry and make trouble

12:22.470 --> 12:23.350
He just wants to separate the family

12:25.230 --> 12:26.430
He is just afraid of his mother

12:27.230 --> 12:27.990
Don't feel wronged anymore

12:29.310 --> 12:30.190
If there is no father

12:30.990 --> 12:31.830
This time we separate

12:33.190 --> 12:34.350
I'm afraid it will be difficult

12:47.470 --> 12:48.190
Silly boy

12:49.190 --> 12:50.350
Mom is not here to make trouble

12:50.990 --> 12:52.590
Mom is here to support you

12:56.990 --> 12:57.590
Keep one's word

12:59.470 --> 13:00.310
We'll separate soon

13:00.710 --> 13:02.470
Just stand next to me and don't talk.

13:03.470 --> 13:04.830
Everything is at my disposal

13:05.350 --> 13:06.350
would you like

13:15.110 --> 13:16.110
It all depends on my mother's arrangements.

13:19.430 --> 13:20.230
grandma grandma

13:20.710 --> 13:21.590
I want to be strong

13:22.110 --> 13:23.190
Who is Dali?

13:23.710 --> 13:25.590
It’s the family’s cow

13:26.630 --> 13:27.070
grandma

13:27.590 --> 13:29.430
I want rhubarb

13:29.950 --> 13:31.350
Who is Dahuang?

13:31.510 --> 13:32.710
the dog at home

13:36.190 --> 13:38.310
Don't worry, grandma is here

13:38.710 --> 13:40.430
All of them are here for you to come over.

13:42.110 --> 13:43.710
And the meat in grandma’s cabinet

13:45.110 --> 13:45.990
Just half and half

13:46.230 --> 13:46.710
half

13:47.710 --> 13:48.230
rest assured

13:50.950 --> 13:51.470
Brother

13:52.590 --> 13:53.070
You

13:54.190 --> 13:55.990
Don't be too dissatisfied, brother, I speak straightforwardly

13:56.350 --> 13:57.190
No, no

13:58.190 --> 14:00.070
You said our two families

14:00.230 --> 14:01.470
It’s not like we live far apart from each other.

14:01.590 --> 14:02.470
Such a big thing happened

14:02.630 --> 14:03.990
You have to tell me

14:04.470 --> 14:05.310
If Man'er hadn't told me

14:05.350 --> 14:05.830
are you planning

14:05.870 --> 14:06.470
Hidden from me forever

14:06.470 --> 14:06.950
no no no

14:06.990 --> 14:08.630
Yes, I lost my etiquette

14:09.190 --> 14:10.630
Just in time for the autumn harvest

14:10.830 --> 14:12.430
I need to get this thing back

14:12.830 --> 14:13.470
Brother

14:14.630 --> 14:16.070
Do you still remember us?

14:16.230 --> 14:17.350
How did we meet?

14:19.190 --> 14:21.190
I worked as a vendor when I was young

14:21.470 --> 14:23.470
Sold fur goods and silk

14:24.590 --> 14:25.310
even

14:26.190 --> 14:27.470
I also sold salt

14:29.230 --> 14:30.070
Brother, what about you?

14:30.350 --> 14:32.750
He's the big shopkeeper in the county shop.

14:33.310 --> 14:34.070
I remember the two of us were

14:34.190 --> 14:35.590
We met in your shop, right?

14:38.470 --> 14:40.870
It’s okay not to mention the past.

14:42.070 --> 14:45.470
Brother, you are honest

14:45.710 --> 14:46.590
Treat our merchants

14:46.750 --> 14:47.710
That's childlike innocence

14:47.990 --> 14:49.110
I admire you from the bottom of my heart

14:49.350 --> 14:50.830
So no matter what you lack

14:51.070 --> 14:51.590
what do you want

14:51.710 --> 14:52.350
I'm thinking about the law

14:52.470 --> 14:53.630
I'll find them all for you

14:54.070 --> 14:55.230
Yep

14:55.470 --> 14:57.190
Later we both became a family

14:57.710 --> 14:58.350
You lost your place

14:58.830 --> 14:59.470
Prosperous children

15:00.470 --> 15:01.510
Just because I take it seriously

15:01.710 --> 15:02.590
Admire my brother

15:02.590 --> 15:03.590
So I put my daughter

15:03.710 --> 15:04.470
Married into your family

15:04.590 --> 15:05.630
I think this is correct

15:05.990 --> 15:06.830
But I didn’t expect you, brother

15:06.870 --> 15:07.350
no no

15:07.830 --> 15:10.350
Normally, this is what happens at home

15:10.510 --> 15:11.590
I rarely care

15:12.110 --> 15:13.190
I really didn't expect that

15:13.350 --> 15:14.510
This bitch can take care of the house

15:14.710 --> 15:16.110
it's so out of control

15:16.350 --> 15:16.990
Separate the family today

15:18.590 --> 15:21.110
I will never let her do this again

15:22.230 --> 15:22.590
Well

15:23.110 --> 15:23.990
There are words like "old brother"

15:24.470 --> 15:25.510
Brother, I'm relieved

15:32.350 --> 15:32.990
Where to go?

15:33.830 --> 15:34.630
Go find Thirteen

15:35.750 --> 15:36.750
Why are you looking for fellow villagers every day?

15:37.590 --> 15:38.990
Let’s separate today and go back tomorrow.

15:39.710 --> 15:40.830
What am I doing here after separation?

15:41.430 --> 15:42.470
I'm not from your family

15:44.230 --> 15:44.830
nephew

15:46.950 --> 15:47.310
How about it

15:47.590 --> 15:48.230
How good these days are

15:51.510 --> 15:51.950
I

15:53.070 --> 15:53.630
Who are you

15:53.950 --> 15:54.630
Uncle has forgotten

15:54.870 --> 15:55.470
I'm your uncle

15:55.950 --> 15:56.430
Uncle

15:57.470 --> 15:57.950
It's not just me

15:58.230 --> 15:58.950
This is your second uncle

15:59.230 --> 15:59.830
That's third uncle

15:59.990 --> 16:00.590
Remember it

16:01.110 --> 16:01.710
I am your second uncle

16:02.190 --> 16:02.590
I am your third uncle

16:02.590 --> 16:03.230
Let me tell you

16:03.590 --> 16:04.350
your business

16:04.470 --> 16:05.230
Your aunt just now

16:05.350 --> 16:06.350
Everything has been explained to us

16:06.870 --> 16:07.590
Don't worry

16:07.990 --> 16:08.470
from now on

16:08.990 --> 16:09.350
no

16:09.630 --> 16:11.310
You have long been part of our Zhang family

16:11.310 --> 16:11.830
is not that right

16:12.110 --> 16:12.990
Go, go, go

16:13.230 --> 16:14.230
Where to go

16:14.590 --> 16:15.590
Help me with the mud

16:15.750 --> 16:16.990
How could we not have you at the top of the wall?

16:16.990 --> 16:17.350
I

16:17.710 --> 16:18.510
Gone, gone, quickly, quickly

16:18.590 --> 16:19.350
no no

16:21.870 --> 16:22.470
Let's go

16:26.950 --> 16:27.350
Here it is

16:27.350 --> 16:28.590
Do the math, do the math

16:29.830 --> 16:30.590
Second child

16:30.830 --> 16:31.230
let me tell you

16:31.350 --> 16:32.830
Open your eyes for a while

16:33.310 --> 16:34.590
Carefully, carefully, seriously

16:34.750 --> 16:35.830
Calculate it for me

16:36.430 --> 16:37.710
That year of yours

16:37.830 --> 16:39.350
Show off your ability to make false accounts

16:39.990 --> 16:40.430
daughter

16:41.110 --> 16:42.310
When did I make false accounts?

16:43.470 --> 16:44.590
The gambling house lost the bet

16:44.950 --> 16:45.630
You made false accounts

16:46.590 --> 16:47.350
How much money was stolen

16:47.510 --> 16:48.590
Do you think your wife doesn’t know?

16:48.590 --> 16:49.430
Your mother-in-law

16:49.870 --> 16:50.350
let me tell you

16:50.630 --> 16:51.190
do not worry

16:51.430 --> 16:52.710
I promise to give you the money

16:52.950 --> 16:54.830
It all goes into your pocket

16:56.350 --> 16:56.870
Second child

16:57.830 --> 16:58.230
father

17:01.390 --> 17:03.270
That’s all the fields in this house

17:04.230 --> 17:05.310
Ask the second child to do the math

17:06.030 --> 17:07.430
You made a mistake and I can't forgive you

17:07.990 --> 17:08.710
Don't worry dad

17:09.030 --> 17:10.869
I have long heard that the second son of the Lian family

17:11.150 --> 17:12.310
He is good at settling accounts

17:13.069 --> 17:13.710
Just right

17:13.990 --> 17:15.710
The old woman was also an accountant before.

17:16.710 --> 17:17.869
Today I will help Shouyi

17:17.990 --> 17:18.510
Do the math

17:20.670 --> 17:21.550
Just an old woman

17:21.670 --> 17:22.630
Getting older

17:23.069 --> 17:23.710
Slow on hand

17:23.910 --> 17:25.990
I hope Shouyi will take care of you a lot.

17:26.630 --> 17:27.550
The situation at home

17:27.710 --> 17:29.710
Shouyi is the clearest

17:29.950 --> 17:31.390
You don't need to worry about it

17:31.430 --> 17:31.750
Right

17:32.070 --> 17:32.710
Yep

17:33.310 --> 17:33.950
mother-in-law

17:34.430 --> 17:35.310
Do you think I am an old woman?

17:35.470 --> 17:36.230
Getting older

17:36.390 --> 17:37.150
Confused

17:37.270 --> 17:38.070
I'm afraid I made a mistake for you

17:38.510 --> 17:40.070
How can this be meant?

17:40.390 --> 17:42.230
That's another reason

17:42.470 --> 17:44.190
This account can only be settled by observing justice.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.390
Can’t others touch you?

17:45.710 --> 17:46.430
No, no, no

17:47.270 --> 17:50.030
You might as well ask your in-laws to help you do the math.

17:50.790 --> 17:52.790
In case there is an error or omission between the two

17:53.230 --> 17:54.230
This is also good for reconciliation

18:01.990 --> 18:02.630
Share it

18:03.870 --> 18:04.670
Home field

18:04.710 --> 18:06.430
A total of thirty-three acres

18:07.030 --> 18:08.670
Nineteen acres of prime farmland

18:09.230 --> 18:10.310
Double cropping rice

18:11.230 --> 18:13.190
Harvesting grain per mu is six stones

18:13.990 --> 18:15.630
Land tax is six taxes and one tax

18:16.190 --> 18:17.510
The medium field has six acres

18:18.910 --> 18:21.150
Harvesting grain per mu is four stones

18:21.670 --> 18:22.870
Xia Qianqiumi

18:23.390 --> 18:24.990
The tax is four cents

18:25.270 --> 18:26.750
The tax rice is one bucket

18:27.390 --> 18:28.750
There are two acres of low-grade fields

18:29.150 --> 18:30.630
Harvesting grain is three stones

18:31.150 --> 18:32.550
稅錢三文三文

18:32.750 --> 18:34.870
The tax meter is four pieces

18:35.710 --> 18:37.710
In addition, there are some vegetable fields

18:37.910 --> 18:38.670
peanut field

18:39.510 --> 18:40.710
and some additional consumption

18:41.430 --> 18:42.230
And that's all

18:59.070 --> 19:00.710
This low-grade land is two acres

19:00.910 --> 19:01.990
Not five acres

19:02.710 --> 19:04.310
Such poor craftsmanship

19:04.750 --> 19:05.470
No wonder before

19:05.550 --> 19:06.950
Lost my accounting job

19:17.030 --> 19:17.550
aunt

19:18.030 --> 19:19.710
You're missing a whole season of rice

19:19.750 --> 19:21.270
A total of four taels of silver were missing.

19:23.670 --> 19:24.070
come over

19:24.550 --> 19:24.990
real

19:24.990 --> 19:26.230
Just four taels short of silver

19:26.270 --> 19:26.710
Yes or no

19:27.150 --> 19:29.150
Still better at keeping justice?

19:29.310 --> 19:30.790
The old woman admires her

19:31.670 --> 19:33.670
Please abide by the rest.

19:33.990 --> 19:34.910
Please help me again

19:36.630 --> 19:38.070
Just take a look and take a look

19:38.230 --> 19:39.630
Let me take a look

19:42.230 --> 19:42.950
Look here

19:43.670 --> 19:45.150
You lost two hundred coins

19:45.710 --> 19:46.270
Look here

19:46.990 --> 19:48.470
I was exempted from tax for a quarter the year before last.

19:48.710 --> 19:49.790
Why isn't this included?

19:50.950 --> 19:51.470
And here

19:52.030 --> 19:53.430
Grandma, you are so majestic

19:53.870 --> 19:55.390
If mother were half as good as you

19:55.710 --> 19:55.990
look

19:55.990 --> 19:57.150
Then you won't be bullied

19:57.470 --> 19:57.870
sharp

19:58.230 --> 19:59.230
Don't learn from your mother

19:59.870 --> 20:01.230
Take a good look at grandma's

20:02.710 --> 20:04.070
See if you calculated it wrong again?

20:04.310 --> 20:06.190
Six taels missing

20:21.190 --> 20:21.870
I said nephew

20:22.510 --> 20:23.190
You are not Shenjiacun

20:23.270 --> 20:24.230
Are you from a farmer's background?

20:24.990 --> 20:26.270
How can you still make the wall crooked?

20:27.030 --> 20:28.270
Uncle, you don’t know

20:28.990 --> 20:30.390
I haven't done this kind of work since I was a child.

20:30.990 --> 20:31.510
These are really

20:31.710 --> 20:32.990
I have enough heart but not enough strength.

20:37.310 --> 20:37.750
That's okay

20:38.470 --> 20:39.470
Then stop doing it, stop doing it

20:39.870 --> 20:40.990
You pick that piece of dirt over there

20:41.230 --> 20:41.790
Come with me and Mud

20:56.630 --> 20:57.070
Uncle

20:58.150 --> 20:59.470
I have been frail and sickly since I was a child.

20:59.710 --> 21:00.870
I flashed my waist just now

21:06.230 --> 21:07.710
Forget it, stop doing it

21:08.230 --> 21:08.990
You go to the kitchen

21:09.230 --> 21:10.030
Bring us some water

21:10.630 --> 21:10.990
okay

21:16.950 --> 21:17.470
Uncle Qingnian

21:18.550 --> 21:19.470
Second uncle and third uncle

21:19.670 --> 21:20.710
Brother Heng is here

21:21.990 --> 21:22.430
several uncles

21:22.550 --> 21:23.630
I came here specially to help my aunt separate the family.

21:23.870 --> 21:24.670
Yes, yes

21:25.470 --> 21:25.910
Brother Heng

21:26.190 --> 21:27.310
Why do you have time to come here today?

21:28.070 --> 21:28.990
I asked for leave from my employer

21:29.230 --> 21:29.710
Come and help too

21:30.030 --> 21:30.430
good

21:30.630 --> 21:31.390
Come on

21:31.470 --> 21:31.710
Come

21:32.950 --> 21:33.310
help

21:36.750 --> 21:37.230
uncle

21:38.430 --> 21:39.630
Who was working here just now?

21:41.070 --> 21:41.950
That Shen Nuo

21:42.550 --> 21:43.950
He can't do anything

21:44.430 --> 21:45.230
Still weak

21:45.510 --> 21:46.230
Your uncle

21:46.390 --> 21:47.310
We can only send him to fetch water

21:48.790 --> 21:50.630
Then he probably won't come back

21:51.230 --> 21:51.710
I come

21:52.790 --> 21:53.990
It’s still our Brother Heng

21:53.990 --> 21:54.710
Reliable

21:55.270 --> 21:56.910
Look at this handy job

21:57.190 --> 21:58.230
This is what work looks like

22:06.230 --> 22:06.750
came back

22:24.990 --> 22:26.230
I think you've lost your mind

22:26.790 --> 22:27.430
I'll let you go home

22:27.510 --> 22:28.630
You'd better deliver it outside

22:28.790 --> 22:29.710
You piss me off so much

22:29.870 --> 22:31.670
When a woman makes a mistake, a horse makes a mistake

22:31.710 --> 22:31.910
no

22:32.030 --> 22:32.470
do not worry

22:32.670 --> 22:33.230
That belongings at the back

22:33.310 --> 22:33.870
I promise

22:33.910 --> 22:34.910
Don't give them an extra penny

22:35.030 --> 22:35.470
OK

22:36.150 --> 22:37.510
When I came back from the county

22:37.710 --> 22:39.070
I brought an old elm table

22:39.230 --> 22:39.910
It's three

22:40.310 --> 22:41.710
There are five pairs of folding back chairs

22:42.230 --> 22:43.190
Ten drums

22:43.750 --> 22:45.030
Depending on how many lines there are, six each

22:45.390 --> 22:46.710
simple screen

22:46.750 --> 22:47.750
Isn’t this all kept here?

22:48.630 --> 22:49.190
See what else

22:49.190 --> 22:50.070
Nothing is left behind

22:52.790 --> 22:53.190
alright

22:54.390 --> 22:54.750
alright

22:57.430 --> 22:58.190
three tables

22:58.470 --> 22:59.070
Five pairs of chairs

22:59.710 --> 23:00.670
Dozens of pieces

23:01.990 --> 23:03.190
silver balance

23:03.710 --> 23:04.870
Three bedrooms only cost 300 yuan

23:05.230 --> 23:05.710
Yes

23:06.630 --> 23:07.270
Every month

23:07.470 --> 23:08.550
I want to give my elder brother three taels of silver

23:08.750 --> 23:09.030
right

23:09.230 --> 23:10.270
Five Hundred Essays on the Successor of the Ancestor

23:10.630 --> 23:11.470
This is what dad decided

23:11.910 --> 23:13.230
Your father and mother also recognize it

23:13.710 --> 23:14.230
Your mother's one

23:14.430 --> 23:15.910
Expenses for medical treatment are not included.

23:16.910 --> 23:18.430
Just eat and drink during this time

23:18.670 --> 23:19.910
spent too much money

23:20.070 --> 23:20.470
yes

23:20.710 --> 23:22.470
What about Linlin Zongzong's dunk?

23:22.950 --> 23:23.670
Three hundred words left

23:24.630 --> 23:26.230
Then fold down two stools

23:26.990 --> 23:27.630
Second uncle

23:27.790 --> 23:28.990
How can this account be calculated like this?

23:30.430 --> 23:31.910
The calculation is correct

23:33.990 --> 23:34.510
only

23:38.230 --> 23:39.030
only

23:39.710 --> 23:40.910
And my mother’s dowry?

23:41.230 --> 23:41.470
No

23:41.470 --> 23:42.270
Mother said it

23:42.710 --> 23:43.510
her dowry

23:43.790 --> 23:44.990
Worth at least fifty taels

23:45.430 --> 23:47.030
After giving birth to me, I did the confinement at home

23:47.910 --> 23:48.230
my grandma

23:48.430 --> 23:48.990
I also brought a dozen more

23:49.150 --> 23:50.230
Wild ducks and pheasants are coming

23:50.430 --> 23:51.630
She didn't eat any of them.

23:52.390 --> 23:53.790
These must be worth five taels, right?

23:54.190 --> 23:54.670
wrong

23:55.030 --> 23:56.070
How can it be calculated like that?

23:56.310 --> 23:56.990
You put the old account

23:57.190 --> 23:57.950
Take it all out and count it all

23:58.230 --> 23:59.990
I gave birth to him and raised him for so many years

24:00.150 --> 24:00.710
How to calculate this account?

24:00.870 --> 24:01.230
Count one for me

24:01.430 --> 24:01.950
old sister-in-law

24:02.630 --> 24:03.550
Do as you say

24:03.950 --> 24:05.310
Then we have raised our daughter for more than ten years

24:05.550 --> 24:06.990
Now she is paralyzed in bed for half her life

24:07.230 --> 24:08.070
How to settle this account?

24:11.270 --> 24:12.230
Man'er is right

24:12.750 --> 24:13.270
you say

24:13.470 --> 24:14.990
This third daughter-in-law

24:15.470 --> 24:16.190
Marry over

24:16.470 --> 24:18.030
Dowry given by mother’s family

24:18.710 --> 24:19.310
should return

24:19.710 --> 24:21.030
It should be paid back

24:21.390 --> 24:22.710
Take it early to exchange for silver

24:22.990 --> 24:24.390
Supplement family expenses

24:26.510 --> 24:28.070
Grandma, you forgot

24:28.710 --> 24:29.710
You give the dowry to your mother

24:29.790 --> 24:30.550
Keep it well

24:31.310 --> 24:32.470
Sister-in-law’s jewelry box

24:33.070 --> 24:33.990
I brought it over

24:36.910 --> 24:38.150
My daughter’s dowry

24:38.430 --> 24:39.910
I prepared it myself

24:40.430 --> 24:41.710
So they're all here

24:43.190 --> 24:44.550
Thank you, mother-in-law

24:46.310 --> 24:47.230
remaining dowry

24:47.390 --> 24:48.390
No more detailed calculations

24:49.430 --> 24:50.190
Fold some belongings

24:53.150 --> 24:53.710
Man'er

24:54.470 --> 24:56.190
Send the jewelry to your mother

24:56.550 --> 24:58.230
Call your uncles over again

24:58.510 --> 25:00.230
Move the belongings to the west wing

25:00.990 --> 25:01.510
okay

25:03.630 --> 25:04.070
Man'er

25:51.190 --> 25:52.470
It's great to be young

25:53.070 --> 25:54.030
It's great to be young

25:56.270 --> 25:57.990
There are still these livestock

25:58.630 --> 26:00.470
The livestock are all here

26:01.430 --> 26:02.470
This is it

26:02.950 --> 26:04.190
The livestock are not here

26:06.230 --> 26:06.710
No

26:08.550 --> 26:09.510
Didn't I tell you?

26:09.710 --> 26:11.150
Don't let the livestock out today

26:11.390 --> 26:12.630
What are you yelling about?

26:13.910 --> 26:14.750
cow last night

26:14.750 --> 26:15.550
Didn't come back

26:15.710 --> 26:16.230
Then it it

26:16.390 --> 26:17.030
How?

26:17.030 --> 26:17.870
When did you find it?

26:17.950 --> 26:18.950
When will we separate?

26:19.150 --> 26:20.150
Why are you so anxious?

26:24.790 --> 26:26.430
In-laws, look

26:26.790 --> 26:27.270
this

27:04.070 --> 27:04.630
Our Xiaoqi

27:04.790 --> 27:05.670
And what about this ability?

27:07.150 --> 27:07.670
relatives by marriage

27:07.990 --> 27:08.910
Now that they're all back

27:09.150 --> 27:09.710
Then let's divide it

27:10.990 --> 27:13.150
Divide chicken, duck and goose into quarters

27:13.710 --> 27:15.510
That's awesome

27:16.430 --> 27:17.230
grandma

27:18.910 --> 27:19.310
relatives by marriage

27:20.470 --> 27:21.510
The account just now

27:21.710 --> 27:22.430
What happened to the accounts

27:22.990 --> 27:25.270
Didn't you just say you were right?

27:26.550 --> 27:27.230
Before

27:27.430 --> 27:28.710
I really want to endure it and give up

27:29.310 --> 27:30.510
But now I still feel

27:30.710 --> 27:31.710
I’m not happy if I don’t vomit.

27:32.710 --> 27:34.750
Your eldest son Shouren

27:34.950 --> 27:35.950
Although he is a scholar

27:36.470 --> 27:37.550
But most of the money in the family

27:37.710 --> 27:38.630
All for his use

27:38.870 --> 27:39.990
Your bowl of water

27:40.270 --> 27:41.470
It's so unfair

27:41.630 --> 27:41.990
no

27:43.750 --> 27:44.230
relatives by marriage

27:44.750 --> 27:45.470
I wanted to

27:45.990 --> 27:47.670
Offer Shouren out

27:48.070 --> 27:50.470
Pull the second child, the third child, and the others

27:51.030 --> 27:52.470
You said Shouren is in town

27:52.710 --> 27:55.150
Manage some relationships in career

27:55.950 --> 27:57.870
So I spent some more money

27:58.430 --> 27:59.070
Can't you?

27:59.390 --> 28:01.670
Now that the in-laws have spoken,

28:02.150 --> 28:03.790
Then that's it

28:03.790 --> 28:04.750
Then kill the cow

28:06.390 --> 28:06.790
separated

28:08.870 --> 28:11.150
Grandma is too strong to kill

28:11.390 --> 28:11.870
old sister-in-law

28:12.630 --> 28:13.750
You have a bad tone

28:14.230 --> 28:15.230
Today's official law

28:15.630 --> 28:16.670
Suicide cow and horse person

28:17.150 --> 28:18.070
One year in prison

28:18.430 --> 28:19.230
Are you afraid of going to jail?

28:19.510 --> 28:19.950
What then?

28:20.270 --> 28:20.950
This cow

28:21.070 --> 28:22.430
If you get sick at our house

28:22.550 --> 28:24.150
Then who can know, right?

28:24.390 --> 28:25.790
No, I can't kill you with great force.

28:25.990 --> 28:26.710
Why can't you kill it?

28:26.990 --> 28:27.870
It has been with us for so many years

28:27.990 --> 28:28.990
What happened to following you for so many years?

28:29.230 --> 28:29.710
How about this

28:31.390 --> 28:33.150
As for the cattle, Xiaoqi should still herd them.

28:33.990 --> 28:35.230
If the in-laws need it

28:35.430 --> 28:36.670
When cultivating the land

28:37.030 --> 28:38.150
Tell Xiao Qi

28:39.070 --> 28:39.630
All right

28:41.190 --> 28:41.510
Milk

28:42.190 --> 28:43.310
We have already given in on this cow.

28:44.190 --> 28:45.230
Can we take the rhubarb away?

28:46.870 --> 28:48.230
This is my dog

28:48.430 --> 28:49.190
is my baby

28:49.390 --> 28:50.510
My lifeblood

28:50.710 --> 28:51.630
Then let it choose

28:53.270 --> 28:53.710
rhubarb

28:54.390 --> 28:54.990
rhubarb rhubarb

28:55.550 --> 28:56.470
Rhubarb comes here

28:56.910 --> 28:57.630
Rhubarb

29:09.870 --> 29:10.390
Brother Youheng

29:10.910 --> 29:12.150
No, don't hold on.

29:12.710 --> 29:14.070
I go to the mountains all year round to collect herbs

29:14.390 --> 29:15.310
Good physical strength

29:15.710 --> 29:17.510
This little bit of life is no big deal

29:24.990 --> 29:25.750
Finally finished moving

29:27.750 --> 29:28.430
great nephew

29:28.750 --> 29:30.030
Where did this go?

29:30.670 --> 29:31.710
There's still a bunch of things that haven't been moved yet.

29:32.470 --> 29:32.910
hurry up

29:33.190 --> 29:33.870
besides

29:35.550 --> 29:36.630
Go and get the chickens, ducks, cows and geese

29:36.750 --> 29:37.270
Come here

29:37.510 --> 29:38.310
There is also a kitchen to divide.

29:38.630 --> 29:39.230
I go first

29:39.430 --> 29:39.990
Hurry up

29:47.190 --> 29:48.030
Thank you for your help

29:48.510 --> 29:48.990
You're welcome

29:49.470 --> 29:49.990
should

29:50.670 --> 29:51.070
Let's go

29:51.150 --> 29:51.510
Walk

29:59.310 --> 29:59.750
Brother Heng

30:00.470 --> 30:00.870
quick

30:00.910 --> 30:01.430
Start to open, start to open

30:15.510 --> 30:15.990
Man'er

30:19.750 --> 30:20.470
Man'er

30:32.870 --> 30:33.230
Milk

30:33.550 --> 30:34.070
what to do

30:35.190 --> 30:35.550
aunt

30:35.790 --> 30:36.910
You don’t want this thing, right?

30:37.150 --> 30:37.870
Then I took it

30:38.430 --> 30:39.990
Second daughter-in-law, please watch carefully.

30:41.310 --> 30:41.750
this

30:42.790 --> 30:43.390
daughter

30:44.470 --> 30:44.990
daughter

30:45.670 --> 30:46.790
Go, let's go, get out of the way

30:48.510 --> 30:48.990
daughter

31:12.630 --> 31:13.310
Don't move

31:14.430 --> 31:15.030
Why not move

31:17.230 --> 31:17.910
look

32:53.230 --> 32:53.750
father

34:00.870 --> 34:03.270
Start the stove, start the stove

34:03.990 --> 34:04.990
Come over to grandpa

34:10.469 --> 34:10.949
Never seen it?

34:33.670 --> 34:35.989
Heavenly official blesses wealth and prosperity

34:36.469 --> 34:37.389
It’s time to start cooking

34:37.469 --> 34:39.270
well

34:39.350 --> 34:39.830
start the fire

34:40.389 --> 34:42.550
Xiaoqi came to see me set off firecrackers

34:42.830 --> 34:43.469
Nothing formal

34:43.989 --> 34:45.310
What should I do if my child is pregnant? Stay away

34:45.590 --> 34:46.790
Be careful, be careful

35:14.150 --> 35:15.030
Sugar cake is coming

35:15.830 --> 35:16.510
OK OK

35:16.670 --> 35:17.430
This is good, this is good

35:17.510 --> 35:18.950
Come, come, have a drink, have a drink

35:18.990 --> 35:20.150
drink drink drink

35:22.470 --> 35:22.830
good

35:23.270 --> 35:23.750
Brother Heng

35:24.150 --> 35:25.950
How is the medical clinic's business lately?

35:26.590 --> 35:27.310
It's okay, it's okay

35:27.430 --> 35:27.990
Where is Wang Laojin?

35:28.110 --> 35:29.390
Wang Lao, Wang Lao Jin, are you okay?

35:29.510 --> 35:30.910
My dad said I'll wait for you next time

35:30.950 --> 35:32.030
I'll definitely have wine and food waiting for you

35:32.110 --> 35:32.510
OK

35:32.990 --> 35:33.830
I'll go meet him another day

35:34.110 --> 35:35.390
Come on, come on, uncle three, come on

35:39.670 --> 35:40.110
Keep your word

35:42.070 --> 35:43.470
Don't forget the promise you gave me

35:43.990 --> 35:44.750
this life

35:44.950 --> 35:46.430
Don't let my daughter suffer anymore

35:46.750 --> 35:47.910
You remember everything

35:49.070 --> 35:50.070
Father-in-law’s teachings

35:50.630 --> 35:52.550
My son-in-law will keep it in mind

35:52.950 --> 35:54.110
Just remember it

35:54.510 --> 35:55.110
Come and have a sip

35:55.950 --> 35:56.310
Dry

35:56.510 --> 35:57.390
Come here, come here

35:57.430 --> 35:58.110
Thank you, second uncle. Thank you, second uncle.

35:58.110 --> 35:58.470
eat

36:01.350 --> 36:01.590
Come

36:01.670 --> 36:02.430
Come to my second uncle

36:02.550 --> 36:02.910
good

36:06.430 --> 36:06.950
Man'er

36:07.790 --> 36:08.630
Been busy these days

36:08.790 --> 36:10.110
Our kitchen at home

36:10.270 --> 36:11.830
The woodshed and pigsty have also been built.

36:11.990 --> 36:12.990
Finish the meal in a while

36:13.110 --> 36:13.830
Let's go first

36:17.070 --> 36:18.830
I can't bear to leave my aunt and grandma

36:19.190 --> 36:19.910
you are here

36:20.150 --> 36:21.510
I feel much more at ease

36:22.750 --> 36:24.270
I can only stay until today

36:24.630 --> 36:25.630
Before winter comes

36:25.950 --> 36:27.270
I still have to go into the mountains and hunt two more times.

36:27.790 --> 36:29.110
Otherwise, wait for the snow to come down

36:29.190 --> 36:30.150
It’s time to close the mountain

36:31.470 --> 36:31.990
Man'er

36:33.190 --> 36:34.350
Although the family is separated

36:35.070 --> 36:36.990
But after all, the bloodline is still there.

36:37.470 --> 36:38.470
How is it possible for two families?

36:38.510 --> 36:40.030
It’s really a clean break

36:41.150 --> 36:41.990
your parents

36:42.310 --> 36:44.030
They are all kind-hearted and soft-tempered.

36:44.910 --> 36:45.390
so many years

36:45.470 --> 36:46.870
It's hard to change again

36:48.990 --> 36:49.630
Don't worry, grandma

36:50.110 --> 36:50.790
As long as I'm here

36:51.350 --> 36:51.950
I will never let my mother

36:51.990 --> 36:52.990
No more grievances

36:54.830 --> 36:55.190
good

36:55.750 --> 36:57.470
Grandma can rest assured that Man'er is here

36:59.030 --> 36:59.870
only

37:07.390 --> 37:08.190
If you can at home

37:08.510 --> 37:10.110
Add another person who can take charge

37:10.470 --> 37:11.870
The days ahead for Man'er

37:12.310 --> 37:13.790
Then you can live better

37:15.950 --> 37:17.030
Why are grandma chatting?

37:17.870 --> 37:19.310
Start urging me to get married

37:19.990 --> 37:21.630
You are an open-minded old lady

37:21.990 --> 37:22.310
Can't be like

37:22.430 --> 37:23.470
Just like other old ladies

37:23.990 --> 37:24.510
Moreover

37:25.430 --> 37:26.470
What's so good about getting married?

37:27.070 --> 37:27.990
Look at my mother

37:28.670 --> 37:29.950
Always bullied by my grandma

37:30.670 --> 37:31.670
I feel so free now

37:31.830 --> 37:32.550
Isn't it good?

37:32.990 --> 37:35.070
So we have to find a good family.

37:35.750 --> 37:36.750
Grandma, look at that Shen Nuo

37:36.870 --> 37:37.630
is a good one

37:38.190 --> 37:39.270
His house was flooded

37:39.470 --> 37:40.870
Now he is the only one left

37:41.350 --> 37:42.470
It's better to recruit him as a wife

37:43.190 --> 37:44.670
I don’t know if he is willing or not.

37:45.030 --> 37:45.670
I saw Youheng

37:45.830 --> 37:47.350
That kid's not bad either

37:47.830 --> 37:48.630
Mild-tempered

37:48.990 --> 37:49.630
We got married later

37:49.750 --> 37:50.550
Definitely for us Man'er

37:50.590 --> 37:51.190
Be obedient and obedient

37:51.310 --> 37:52.310
aunt aunt

37:52.470 --> 37:53.150
aunt

37:53.990 --> 37:56.470
It's impossible for me and him both

37:56.830 --> 37:58.470
I have to leave after making money

38:01.830 --> 38:04.670
Where do you want to go after you make money?

38:08.470 --> 38:09.190
Where can I go?

38:09.270 --> 38:10.070
I mean

38:10.950 --> 38:12.350
I want to make a lot of money, a lot of money

38:12.430 --> 38:13.510
lots, lots, lots of money

38:15.550 --> 38:16.390
this child

38:39.310 --> 38:41.470
Nuo Geer, what are these days?

38:41.830 --> 38:43.190
Although you are busy before and after

38:43.350 --> 38:44.030
But I found out

38:44.150 --> 38:45.750
That look in your kid's eyes

38:46.630 --> 38:48.110
I have never left Man'er

38:48.470 --> 38:49.190
What's the matter

38:49.950 --> 38:50.510
Yes or no

38:50.830 --> 38:52.150
Falling in love with our Man'er

38:54.310 --> 38:55.470
What did uncle say?

38:56.630 --> 38:57.030
Big man

38:57.190 --> 38:58.270
What are you ashamed of?

38:58.590 --> 39:00.350
Once you fall in love with it, you fall in love with it

39:01.870 --> 39:02.430
You

39:03.030 --> 39:03.790
good looking

39:04.270 --> 39:04.990
and diligent

39:05.550 --> 39:06.070
has hope

39:06.670 --> 39:08.910
Uncle, I am optimistic about you

39:09.430 --> 39:10.030
Optimistic about you

39:10.350 --> 39:10.790
Uncle

39:11.110 --> 39:12.430
Nephew, here’s a toast to you

39:13.350 --> 39:13.870
Eat

39:17.110 --> 39:17.630
Pour it for you

39:19.430 --> 39:19.870
Brother Heng

39:21.670 --> 39:22.790
You

39:23.350 --> 39:23.950
good looking

39:24.470 --> 39:25.270
and diligent

39:25.990 --> 39:26.790
has hope

39:27.470 --> 39:28.350
Uncle is optimistic about you

39:28.790 --> 39:29.270
boss

39:29.470 --> 39:30.670
Everyone is optimistic about you

39:33.030 --> 39:34.190
My dad is right

39:35.550 --> 39:35.990
Come

39:51.150 --> 39:51.670
Come, come, come

39:51.750 --> 39:52.430
drink one drink one

39:52.910 --> 39:53.150
Come

39:53.430 --> 39:53.990
Got it done

41:12.630 --> 41:13.470
Either say it

41:13.950 --> 41:15.470
Is it still comfortable for the eldest brother?

41:17.110 --> 41:18.630
The scholar and husband don’t have to work

41:19.390 --> 41:20.150
What a life

41:20.870 --> 41:21.990
All done to the talented lady

41:29.550 --> 41:30.030
Lian Shouyi

41:31.270 --> 41:31.990
What time is this?

41:32.070 --> 41:33.310
We are still wasting our time with this

41:34.070 --> 41:34.990
Go talk to your mother

41:35.470 --> 41:36.110
I dont go

41:37.750 --> 41:38.870
So many families were divided

41:38.990 --> 41:40.510
Mom must be angry there

41:41.150 --> 41:41.830
If you want to go you go

41:43.350 --> 41:44.510
I get angry when I mention this

41:45.110 --> 41:46.630
Our family’s property land

41:46.990 --> 41:48.270
That's what I sent away

41:48.910 --> 41:49.630
Give away so much

41:49.870 --> 41:51.190
I don't have time to reason with you yet.

41:51.830 --> 41:52.510
Look at her again

41:53.270 --> 41:54.950
I can't compete with the few from Laosan's family.

41:55.470 --> 41:56.510
Just know how to rub us

41:57.150 --> 41:57.990
The nest is full

42:03.590 --> 42:04.470
I'm pregnant with the baby

42:05.790 --> 42:06.950
I'm pregnant with the baby

42:07.830 --> 42:08.470
I don't sleep

42:09.150 --> 42:10.110
He has to sleep too

42:11.270 --> 42:12.150
I'm so stiff today

42:12.310 --> 42:13.590
It's just a hard time

42:13.990 --> 42:15.270
I won’t do any more work

42:15.430 --> 42:16.550
I'll see what she can do to me

42:25.190 --> 42:25.910
what

42:28.550 --> 42:30.190
If you don't work, you're just wandering around here.

42:52.350 --> 42:53.550
No one can sleep until we finish fucking.

42:57.990 --> 42:58.590
Step aside
