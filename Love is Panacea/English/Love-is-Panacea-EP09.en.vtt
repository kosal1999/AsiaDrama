13:29.820 --> 13:30.820
sorry.

13:31.300 --> 13:33.940
I happen to want
to ask you for help.

13:33.940 --> 13:35.420
When I'm in the lab,

13:35.420 --> 13:39.060
Her background of false positive chromosomes
was severe.

13:39.060 --> 13:40.580
I remember it wasn't like this before.

13:42.460 --> 13:43.660
There are many possibilities.

13:44.220 --> 13:45.540
How long does it take to separate serum?

13:45.820 --> 13:46.820
half an hour.

13:46.940 --> 13:48.180
Try adding an hour.

13:50.220 --> 13:51.180
That's true.

13:51.220 --> 13:52.700
Back to the lab

13:52.700 --> 13:54.180
The teacher once said.

13:54.460 --> 13:56.580
You see, I've been so busy lately
that I've forgotten.

13:57.900 --> 13:59.900
Master never said that.

13:59.980 --> 14:00.980
I said that.

14:04.420 --> 14:04.740
[Su Wei'an]

14:08.820 --> 14:10.180
I still think you were bullied again

14:10.180 --> 14:10.980
By this cunning girl.

14:11.380 --> 14:12.140
In the past, he had

14:12.140 --> 14:13.580
Make you suffer a lot.

14:14.220 --> 14:16.220
With you here, who else can I bully?

14:16.460 --> 14:19.180
You are my
only friend in this world.

14:19.580 --> 14:20.940
No need to say more.

14:21.620 --> 14:22.620
pain

14:23.660 --> 14:25.300
Sorry, did I hurt your wound?

14:25.460 --> 14:26.420
let me see.

14:26.420 --> 14:27.300
quickly.

14:28.380 --> 14:29.220
It's enough.

14:29.420 --> 14:31.500
Don't expect to touch me.

14:32.220 --> 14:32.780
I...

14:33.940 --> 14:34.980
You really like teasing me, don't you?

14:35.420 --> 14:37.260
Look at what delicious food you brought me
.

14:39.620 --> 14:41.220
Big dumplings.

14:43.380 --> 14:44.380
you do not know,

14:45.060 --> 14:47.060
I'm so bored outside alone

14:47.260 --> 14:48.780
Fortunately, you are by my side.

14:48.780 --> 14:50.780
Soon I
won't be able to accompany you anymore.

14:50.980 --> 14:52.660
On weekends
we will go to free therapy

14:52.660 --> 14:54.020
In Labei Village with Dr. Gu.

14:54.340 --> 14:55.340
Rabe Village?

14:57.460 --> 14:58.260
you're not here,

14:58.420 --> 14:59.780
So I have to bear it alone

14:59.980 --> 15:01.980
All translation tasks for the entire medical team.

15:02.580 --> 15:03.580
If so, I will accompany you.

15:03.780 --> 15:04.460
cannot.

15:04.620 --> 15:05.940
Your wounds haven't healed yet.

15:06.540 --> 15:08.100
So
heal your wounds here.

15:08.780 --> 15:09.780
Jiang.

15:10.380 --> 15:12.220
The people of Lakaya Village,

15:12.420 --> 15:14.180
Their French has an accent.

15:15.260 --> 15:17.740
In addition, there are
people who only speak in tongues.

15:17.740 --> 15:19.260
You
definitely can't handle it alone.

15:21.140 --> 15:22.100
This is also true.

15:24.780 --> 15:25.700
You can't go either.

15:25.700 --> 15:27.700
What if your wound becomes infected?

15:27.700 --> 15:28.700
Too dangerous.

15:28.700 --> 15:30.260
I brought gauze
and disinfectant.

15:30.420 --> 15:31.980
Besides,
if something really happens,

15:31.980 --> 15:34.020
Don’t we have the greatest surgeon?

15:34.140 --> 15:35.580
There will be no problem.

15:37.340 --> 15:39.300
that's right. Dr. Xu had no choice but
to provide free treatment.

15:40.340 --> 15:41.900
Besides,
I'm not calm about leaving you either.

15:41.900 --> 15:42.860
alone in hospital

15:43.460 --> 15:44.020
OK

15:47.180 --> 15:48.180
Is Wei An still online?

15:48.500 --> 15:49.420
It has been closed since then.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.100
Looks like he's very busy.

15:54.980 --> 15:57.020
So, did he just say

15:57.300 --> 15:58.820
What part of Rakaya is he in?

15:59.220 --> 16:00.220
I didn't ask.

16:01.100 --> 16:02.860
I don't know why he
would go to such a place.

16:08.140 --> 16:09.100
Lakaya.

16:10.700 --> 16:11.980
Why did it happen in Lakaya?

16:16.220 --> 16:19.060
[Su Wei'an]

16:19.060 --> 16:19.780
(Wei'an)

16:20.180 --> 16:22.060
(Which area of ​​Lakaya are you in?)

16:22.380 --> 16:23.540
(In which hospital?)

16:39.020 --> 16:40.020
Doctor Fang.

16:40.660 --> 16:42.660
This French bread is as hard as a rock.

16:43.860 --> 16:44.820
I won't eat.

16:45.100 --> 16:46.740
I'd better keep it for self-defense.

16:46.740 --> 16:48.340
Free treatment this time
is far away.

16:48.420 --> 16:50.060
if you don't eat now

16:50.140 --> 16:51.580
From now on there will be nothing there.

16:52.060 --> 16:53.220
OK

16:53.220 --> 16:54.620
Eat breakfast.

16:54.620 --> 16:55.980
You know you're tired of free therapy,

16:55.980 --> 16:57.980
I asked the cafeteria aunt
to make steamed buns.

16:58.220 --> 16:59.220
Meat buns.

17:02.220 --> 17:03.980
There are buns.

17:04.500 --> 17:05.500
wait.

17:05.860 --> 17:06.860
Can everyone please stop eating?

17:08.980 --> 17:10.380
There is such good in the world.

17:10.780 --> 17:12.780
Translator Su
is full of careful planning

17:12.780 --> 17:14.660
Everyone is still invited
to enjoy the free breakfast.

17:14.660 --> 17:15.780
There must be an element of deception in this.

17:16.300 --> 17:17.260
Any tips?

17:18.260 --> 17:19.460
If you really think you have a trick

17:19.460 --> 17:20.500
You can also give me money.

17:21.700 --> 17:22.660
One tea egg,

17:22.660 --> 17:23.700
Two steamed buns,

17:23.700 --> 17:24.940
A cup of soy milk,

17:25.980 --> 17:27.540
The price is 20 US dollars.
It’s not expensive, right?

17:28.860 --> 17:29.980
I told you, right?

17:30.060 --> 17:31.900
Such a breakfast set
costs 100 yuan.

17:31.900 --> 17:33.340
What crazy money.

17:33.580 --> 17:34.780
What did you say?

17:34.780 --> 17:35.900
Who is crazy about money?

17:35.900 --> 17:36.900
You are the one who is crazy about money.

17:38.060 --> 17:39.300
I can't even close my mouth to eat.

17:39.300 --> 17:40.300
Fang Mingfan.

17:40.300 --> 17:41.740
Our Vian is beautiful and kind.

17:41.740 --> 17:43.140
He paid with his own money.

17:43.140 --> 17:46.060
However, these buns
really shouldn’t be wasted.

17:46.060 --> 17:49.020
Overtime pay must be paid for weekend overtime
work.

17:49.020 --> 17:51.020
Sooner or later he will
be replaced by Dr. Gu.

17:53.820 --> 17:54.700
OK

17:54.700 --> 17:55.940
Gandiya Ganti.

17:59.060 --> 18:00.020
Mali.

18:00.540 --> 18:01.500
Mali.

18:04.340 --> 18:05.340
No coriander leaves.

18:06.220 --> 18:07.180
What?

18:07.620 --> 18:10.300
Especially for those who
don't have coriander leaves.

18:13.020 --> 18:15.020
How do you know
I didn't eat cilantro?

18:15.460 --> 18:17.260
That time when we were eating hot pot,

18:17.460 --> 18:19.060
I saw you
took out the coriander leaves.

18:21.740 --> 18:23.460
Even at this age,
he is still picky about his food.

18:27.460 --> 18:28.460
Thanks.

18:50.640 --> 18:52.080
Just add a little more medicine.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
what's wrong with you?

19:01.200 --> 19:02.600
OMG it smells so bad.

19:03.840 --> 19:05.320
I told you
not to drink too much water.

19:05.680 --> 19:07.080
You will never get enough of the toilets here
.

19:10.840 --> 19:11.360
Why?

19:19.800 --> 19:21.160
You stepped on dirt.

19:21.920 --> 19:23.160
Still talking. Hurry and help clean up.

19:23.160 --> 19:24.160
It follows.

19:26.600 --> 19:27.280
Why?

19:28.200 --> 19:29.080
Kakiku.

19:29.120 --> 19:29.920
Ayo.

19:30.760 --> 19:31.600
sit down.

19:32.560 --> 19:33.400
A little plan.

19:35.320 --> 19:36.000
Thanks.

19:36.160 --> 19:36.840
It doesn't matter.

19:43.720 --> 19:44.560
Good seats.

19:44.560 --> 19:45.560
What happened to him?

19:46.840 --> 19:47.720
her mother

19:47.720 --> 19:49.320
I haven't been able to speak
or move for three months.

19:49.680 --> 19:51.200
He wanted to ask a doctor to come to
his house to check it out.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.720
However, you can only go to his house on foot,
not by car.

19:55.280 --> 19:56.960
The kid
walked for hours before getting here.

20:01.560 --> 20:04.000
I beg you, please, my mother.

20:06.480 --> 20:09.480
I'll go with you, don't panic.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.000
You need to treat him first.

20:15.360 --> 20:16.960
Doctor Gu, please wait for me.

20:17.360 --> 20:18.520
I accidentally sprained my foot.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.080
However,
I can go with you after a short break.

20:20.400 --> 20:21.360
enough.

20:21.680 --> 20:22.360
Don't leave.

20:22.360 --> 20:23.440
This is what your feet look like.

20:23.440 --> 20:25.000
It will also take a lot of time for you to go
.

20:25.320 --> 20:26.200
No, I have to go.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.440
Doctor Gu, please wait for me.

20:27.440 --> 20:28.120
Jiang Muying.

20:28.480 --> 20:29.440
Don't leave.

20:29.640 --> 20:31.040
I'll just go alone.

20:31.080 --> 20:32.080
How did that happen?

20:32.080 --> 20:33.080
I will go with you.

20:33.920 --> 20:34.920
However, your injury...

20:36.000 --> 20:37.400
It's getting better now, don't worry.

20:40.680 --> 20:41.480
Is it there?

20:41.480 --> 20:42.560
Right there.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Be careful.

20:56.480 --> 20:58.080
Mom, the doctor is here.

20:58.080 --> 20:59.640
You'll be fine.

21:17.080 --> 21:18.080
Look at my fingers.

21:18.440 --> 21:19.480
Look at my fingers.

21:35.200 --> 21:37.200
Try to hold my fingers.

21:37.520 --> 21:38.520
Hold your fingers.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.160
hold onto.

21:42.280 --> 21:43.160
hold onto.

21:53.960 --> 21:56.000
I think these symptoms are

21:57.400 --> 21:58.880
You can also make a diagnosis.

22:00.200 --> 22:01.200
paralyzed,

22:01.680 --> 22:02.680
Speech disorder.

22:04.240 --> 22:05.280
most likely

22:06.200 --> 22:07.200
It's a stroke.

22:08.280 --> 22:09.920
His condition is already very serious and
it should be difficult for him to recover.

22:15.400 --> 22:16.880
Is there anyone else at home?

22:22.480 --> 22:23.760
I will prescribe medicine later.

22:23.840 --> 22:24.880
You tell him first.

22:25.520 --> 22:26.520
do this action

22:27.400 --> 22:28.240
every day,

22:28.960 --> 22:30.040
20 kali per set.

22:30.880 --> 22:32.120
Do three sets every day.

22:32.720 --> 22:33.720
do this action

22:34.200 --> 22:35.320
every day,

22:35.320 --> 22:36.200
20 kali per set.

22:36.200 --> 22:37.200
Do three sets every day.

22:37.280 --> 22:38.760
Legs too

22:39.640 --> 22:40.640
20 kali per set.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.200
Do three sets every day.

22:43.080 --> 22:44.080
Legs too

22:44.640 --> 22:46.240
20 reps per set.
Do three sets every day.

22:47.160 --> 22:48.160
No need to rush.

22:48.720 --> 22:50.160
ensure patient

22:50.360 --> 22:52.680
The joints are sufficiently stretched.

22:53.040 --> 22:54.640
Can't go too fast, okay?

22:55.680 --> 22:58.720
This way you can help
your mother recover.

22:59.960 --> 23:03.000
Will my mother recover faster if I do this every day?

23:04.360 --> 23:06.520
Will my mother recover faster if I do this every day?

23:07.080 --> 23:08.040
Mali.

23:16.280 --> 23:17.160
I believe,

23:17.480 --> 23:19.000
Your mother knows you won't give up

23:19.920 --> 23:22.280
He will continue to work hard

23:23.280 --> 23:24.440
and will be restored.

23:30.920 --> 23:32.920
Take it easy and don't step on rocks.

23:33.040 --> 23:35.040
The rocks are slippery, so be careful.

23:42.360 --> 23:43.040
Why?

23:44.040 --> 23:45.040
I'm thinking.

23:45.720 --> 23:47.080
While in the hospital,

23:47.200 --> 23:48.000
you keep begging me

23:48.000 --> 23:49.880
Explain the patient's condition honestly
.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.160
However, why is it different today?

23:53.400 --> 23:55.080
I clearly know there will be no results

23:55.080 --> 23:56.280
Why do you have to teach me over and over again?

23:56.840 --> 23:58.440
How is the patient's daughter recovering?

24:13.680 --> 24:16.120
Instead of letting them despair
and wait for death,

24:16.440 --> 24:17.240
better one

24:19.160 --> 24:20.480
Let’s try it together again.

24:24.480 --> 24:25.480
sometimes,

24:26.800 --> 24:27.800
like

24:28.440 --> 24:30.000
Maybe it can work wonders.

24:33.400 --> 24:34.760
What if your efforts are fruitless?

24:36.120 --> 24:37.120
Is it worth it?

24:39.440 --> 24:40.840
with loved ones,

24:41.680 --> 24:42.680
Do whatever it takes.

24:50.080 --> 24:52.080
Come on, let's find a place to take shelter.

24:57.200 --> 24:58.200
There is a cave here,

24:58.480 --> 24:59.480
Take shelter inside.

25:00.640 --> 25:01.200
quickly.

25:08.720 --> 25:09.760
What now?

25:10.400 --> 25:11.200
It rained too much.

25:12.560 --> 25:14.840
We can only wait here first.

25:15.160 --> 25:16.200
We left after the rain stopped.

25:17.040 --> 25:18.040
That's all.

25:27.400 --> 25:28.680
No signal?

25:28.680 --> 25:29.720
No.

25:29.720 --> 25:31.200
Unable to contact
Jiang et al.

25:31.440 --> 25:32.000
how?

25:35.200 --> 25:37.320
First light a bonfire
to dry the clothes.

25:45.720 --> 25:46.720
What’s wrong with you?

25:47.920 --> 25:48.920
It doesn't matter.

25:49.440 --> 25:51.600
Maybe my wound was soaked by the rain,

25:52.040 --> 25:52.920
So it's a little uncomfortable.

27:09.960 --> 27:11.480

'm a doctor

Let's make it like this.

42:21.200 --> 42:23.080
We are looking for a safe place
to wait.

42:23.640 --> 42:24.520
At least until morning.

42:24.840 --> 42:25.360
OK

42:26.160 --> 42:26.720
Ayo.

42:27.600 --> 42:28.200
I can do it myself.

42:28.920 --> 42:29.960
Your wounds haven't healed yet.

42:31.640 --> 42:32.400
slowly.

42:38.760 --> 42:39.400
Slowly, yes.

42:44.040 --> 42:44.920
Fang Mingfan, tunggu aku.

42:44.920 --> 42:45.640
This is a mountain road.

42:45.960 --> 42:46.960
Are you still afraid?

42:48.080 --> 42:49.080
I'm not afraid.

42:52.600 --> 42:53.720
You have to come here.
