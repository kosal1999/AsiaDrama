25:45.700 --> 25:46.820
Why do not you say it,

25:46.860 --> 25:48.780
If Godzilla hadn't
saved the world

25:48.900 --> 25:49.980
Then Su Wei'an won't be injured?

25:51.940 --> 25:52.740
It also makes sense.

25:52.900 --> 25:53.860
Can be added next time.

26:00.980 --> 26:01.500
Thanks.

26:02.220 --> 26:03.540
You still come to comfort me.

26:13.060 --> 26:13.780
(Oh yes!)

26:15.220 --> 26:16.380
(current moment)

26:16.620 --> 26:18.100
(Coincidence is the best opportunity)

26:18.100 --> 26:19.580
(Wei An and Dr. Gu develop a relationship.)

26:20.300 --> 26:22.180
(Slightly different from the script)

26:22.180 --> 26:23.420
(The hero saves the beauty,)

26:23.540 --> 26:25.380
(But the results
look much better.)

26:26.100 --> 26:28.700
(Jiang Muying,
your words are unlucky.)

26:29.500 --> 26:31.580
(You are Cupid in love.)

26:52.100 --> 26:53.100
Gu Yunzheng.

27:09.660 --> 27:10.970
Why are you here?

27:11.970 --> 27:12.900
Where is Jiang?

27:13.180 --> 27:14.580
Did you just call me by my name?

27:16.260 --> 27:16.970
Did you dream about me?

27:20.420 --> 27:21.380
No.

27:23.260 --> 27:24.700
If so,
why did you call me by my name?

27:28.930 --> 27:29.530
I...

27:30.660 --> 27:33.530
I want to say that I
still owe you money now.

27:33.860 --> 27:34.780
What?

27:37.450 --> 27:39.970
Didn't you help me pay the fine at the police station?

27:40.300 --> 27:42.820
This time, my representation failed;

27:43.140 --> 27:45.860
The down payment and balance were gone,
and even I was hurt.

27:47.450 --> 27:48.530
Enough to pay off all my debts.

27:49.380 --> 27:50.180
if not you

27:50.180 --> 27:51.980
Who definitely wants to collect
coffee beans and what are they?

27:53.380 --> 27:54.740
Impossible
to be chased by bad guys.

27:54.980 --> 27:55.980
That...

27:57.620 --> 27:58.620
Be careful.

27:59.700 --> 28:01.980
Even if all the bad guys come to
attack you.

28:13.500 --> 28:14.500
you

28:15.740 --> 28:17.220
Sacrifice his life to protect me.

28:19.620 --> 28:20.980
Is it because my life is precious?

28:34.740 --> 28:35.980
Oh, Bernal.

28:36.860 --> 28:38.820
Your life is more valuable than mine.

28:39.620 --> 28:41.620
If you are still alive, you can save
many more people.

28:45.140 --> 28:46.140
Su Wei'an.

28:46.980 --> 28:47.980
Don't do this again.

28:49.340 --> 28:51.300
no one's life

28:51.300 --> 28:53.300
This is
worth more than other people's lives.

29:10.180 --> 29:11.180
Jiang.

29:11.460 --> 29:12.380
Do you know?

29:16.180 --> 29:17.460
Doctor Gu.

29:17.460 --> 29:19.860
Will you continue to stay with Wei An here?

29:20.300 --> 29:22.460
Sorry to bother you, you are very considerate.

29:22.980 --> 29:24.740
What precautions?

29:25.220 --> 29:26.980
He is my primary doctor.

29:26.980 --> 29:28.540
Isn't this how it should be?

29:29.540 --> 29:30.620
Understand the patient's condition?

29:35.940 --> 29:36.580
Later you

29:37.180 --> 29:39.180
Clean up all the weird stuff

29:39.620 --> 29:40.580
in his mind

29:40.980 --> 29:41.980
To avoid wound infection.

29:44.380 --> 29:45.500
This is medical advice.

29:46.820 --> 29:47.300
OK

30:01.620 --> 30:02.620
Wei'an.

30:03.980 --> 30:05.700
I really hope it's me who gets hurt.

30:05.980 --> 30:08.740
You must be very sick
because you lost a lot of blood.

30:08.980 --> 30:09.980
It doesn't matter.

30:10.580 --> 30:12.540
You know I'm not afraid of pain.

30:12.980 --> 30:14.100
It will never happen again.

30:14.460 --> 30:16.540
Don't go anywhere,
just stay here.

30:16.660 --> 30:17.860
I know.

30:18.660 --> 30:19.700
Oh yes.

30:19.780 --> 30:21.980
Don't tell my mom
I'm hurt.

30:22.620 --> 30:23.780
He will be anxious.

30:25.980 --> 30:26.980
I know.

30:28.980 --> 30:30.580
The medical advice given by Dr. Gu
is very good.

30:30.980 --> 30:32.140
Haven't liked it for a long time

30:32.140 --> 30:33.740
Look at that weird ponytail of yours.

30:33.940 --> 30:36.980
Give me back the beautiful, smart woman from my medical department.

30:37.460 --> 30:38.540
Jiang Muying.

30:39.420 --> 30:40.420
Who do you support?

30:40.980 --> 30:42.180
Dr. Gu

30:42.460 --> 30:44.340
Keep waiting for you to wake up.

30:44.660 --> 30:45.780
He really cares about you.

30:48.260 --> 30:50.140
Doctors pay attention to patients,

30:50.500 --> 30:52.020
Isn't this a natural thing?

30:56.900 --> 30:57.540
And you?

30:58.340 --> 30:59.700
Blocked the villain's blow for Dr. Gu

31:00.020 --> 31:00.980
Is this normal?

31:01.180 --> 31:02.980
What did I do to save
him from getting hit?

31:03.700 --> 31:04.700
That was not what I meant.

31:04.980 --> 31:05.860
This is his name,

31:06.380 --> 31:07.300
It's too late for me to escape.

31:09.100 --> 31:10.100
I'm telling you, yes.

31:10.380 --> 31:11.860
This time I suffered heavy losses.

31:13.460 --> 31:15.460
I feel that Gu Yunzheng and I are not suitable for each other.

31:16.220 --> 31:17.620
Every time I meet him,

31:17.980 --> 31:19.340
The lightest thing is loss,

31:19.740 --> 31:20.980
The worst thing that can happen is getting injured.

31:21.820 --> 31:22.500
is this real?

31:24.700 --> 31:27.620
But maybe Dr. Gu
doesn’t think so?

31:30.460 --> 31:31.460
save life,

31:32.260 --> 31:34.300
Shouldn't we
repay it with wedding vows?

31:35.780 --> 31:37.420
What are your wedding vows?

31:38.420 --> 31:38.980
no.

31:39.180 --> 31:40.140
It's me who's hurt now

31:40.140 --> 31:41.500
Why are you so stupid?

31:42.500 --> 31:43.940
Still reciting the wedding vows.

31:44.420 --> 31:45.980
I'm so angry that my head hurts!

31:49.820 --> 31:51.860
Okay, I won't say anymore.

31:52.100 --> 31:53.100
It hurts, doesn't it?

31:58.060 --> 31:58.940
Wei'an.

31:59.340 --> 32:00.220
do you know?

32:00.660 --> 32:02.900
A person has a chance
to meet true love in his life,

32:02.900 --> 32:04.500
Only three to a billion.

32:05.140 --> 32:07.900
Therefore, since you have met,
you must cherish it.

32:07.900 --> 32:08.980
do not give up.

32:09.220 --> 32:10.980
Only three to a billion?

32:14.300 --> 32:15.460
that opportunity

32:16.060 --> 32:17.700
Much less severe than acute illness.

32:20.340 --> 32:21.700
When it comes to love and death, it's natural,

32:22.180 --> 32:24.220
remains
a theme in human life.

32:26.980 --> 32:29.500
What are you, dead
and seriously ill?

32:29.660 --> 32:30.660
Just talk every day!

32:30.980 --> 32:31.980
It's enough.

32:32.580 --> 32:33.980
I shouldn't talk nonsense.

32:34.980 --> 32:36.660
You're talking nonsense again,
let's break up!

32:39.340 --> 32:42.500
[Friendship RS]

32:53.820 --> 32:54.820
Gu Yunzheng.

32:56.860 --> 32:58.420
I've tried
various types of word combinations,

32:59.140 --> 33:01.460
But
the complete meaning cannot be assembled.

33:01.580 --> 33:02.140
It's all over.

33:08.700 --> 33:09.580
There is dust.

33:38.380 --> 33:39.020
you

33:40.180 --> 33:42.740
Are you sacrificing your life to protect me
because my life is precious?

33:43.260 --> 33:44.740
Your life is more valuable than mine.

33:45.900 --> 33:47.900
If you are still alive, you can save
many more people.

33:56.740 --> 33:57.780
Damn, this crazy woman.

33:58.740 --> 34:00.740
What on earth was he thinking?

34:09.740 --> 34:10.940
go to hell?

34:12.500 --> 34:13.980
The heroine
sacrificed a lot for him,

34:15.020 --> 34:17.020
In the end, he died for him.

34:18.260 --> 34:19.220
how come?

34:20.740 --> 34:22.740
Until his death, he did not
confess his love to the male protagonist.

34:23.260 --> 34:24.460
according to.

34:28.180 --> 34:29.180
Doctor Gu.

34:29.340 --> 34:31.580
We're not slacking off.

34:31.740 --> 34:33.340
It's time to go home from get off work.

34:33.420 --> 34:36.260
Please
don't tell the head nurse, Doctor Gu.

34:36.740 --> 34:37.740
I asked you.

34:39.740 --> 34:40.380
that woman,

34:42.380 --> 34:45.100
Why is he willing to die for the hero?

34:48.180 --> 34:49.100
because of love.

34:49.580 --> 34:52.220
She really likes
the hero.

34:52.220 --> 34:53.780
I couldn't bear to see him
get hurt in the slightest.

34:54.020 --> 34:56.740
She chose to sacrifice herself
to protect the male protagonist.

35:00.740 --> 35:03.740
The heroine
has done a lot of things for the hero.

35:05.180 --> 35:07.740
But
why didn't he admit it?

35:07.740 --> 35:08.740
Gu Yunzheng.

35:08.780 --> 35:10.500
Did you just call me by my name?

35:10.740 --> 35:11.420
No.

35:13.180 --> 35:14.300
That's because women are

35:14.300 --> 35:16.300
There is another creature in the mouth and another creature in the heart.

35:16.300 --> 35:18.780
I want to say that I
still owe you money now.

35:18.860 --> 35:20.340
No matter how deep her
love for a man is,

35:20.340 --> 35:21.740
Will not admit it proactively
.

35:21.900 --> 35:24.260
Whoever admits it first
loses.

35:25.580 --> 35:26.060
is this real?

35:26.060 --> 35:28.740
certainly.
All drama scripts are written like this.

35:29.260 --> 35:30.020
Doctor Gu.

35:30.260 --> 35:32.740
I'm more professional than you on this matter.

35:36.940 --> 35:37.900
So that’s it, yes.

35:39.860 --> 35:41.540
Doctor Gu, let’s go first.

35:52.180 --> 35:53.420
afraid of losing?

36:00.080 --> 36:01.040
good smell.

36:51.760 --> 36:53.440
Dr. Gu, what a coincidence.

36:55.400 --> 36:56.600
Why are you here?

36:57.760 --> 36:58.440
I...

36:59.600 --> 37:00.600
I just finished my work.

37:02.760 --> 37:04.040
Have you been here long?

37:06.760 --> 37:08.280
I don't want to disturb your interest

37:09.600 --> 37:10.920
Go to enjoy the flowers in the evening.

37:13.760 --> 37:14.440
very beautiful.

37:14.760 --> 37:16.280
Do you like jacaranda flowers too?

37:18.360 --> 37:19.360
I mean,

37:20.280 --> 37:22.760
You are beautiful like this.

37:33.880 --> 37:34.400
That...

37:36.520 --> 37:37.160
It's getting late.

37:37.640 --> 37:39.080
Go back and rest quickly.

38:06.800 --> 38:07.800
(I mean,)

38:09.040 --> 38:11.760
(You look so beautiful like this.)

38:17.880 --> 38:20.040
(Su Weian,
what stupid disease do you have?)

38:20.440 --> 38:21.920
(Whether Jiang Muying is infected)

38:22.240 --> 38:24.800
(Or experiencing the side effects of a concussion?)

38:37.800 --> 38:41.440
Did you
see Sue at the Hospital de l'Amitie at that time?

38:41.760 --> 38:44.160
Yes, he
hid in the hospital by working as a translator.

38:44.840 --> 38:47.240
Friendship Hospital has a special status.

38:47.400 --> 38:49.320
We dare not act rashly.

38:50.120 --> 38:51.160
My head is going to explode

38:51.160 --> 38:52.200
Still need to deal with this issue.

38:52.200 --> 38:53.560
Fake wine gives me
a headache.

38:58.160 --> 38:59.160
Call in the Guard.

38:59.640 --> 39:00.480
OK

39:05.160 --> 39:06.040
However, General

39:06.160 --> 39:07.160
Dr. Elliot has said,

39:07.160 --> 39:08.440
All inspection reports

39:08.440 --> 39:10.240
It means
there is nothing wrong with your brain.

39:10.240 --> 39:11.720
There were no tumors or bleeding.

39:12.400 --> 39:13.880
Medical equipment and resources at the French National Hospital

39:13.880 --> 39:15.400
Always the best in Lakaya.

39:15.400 --> 39:16.160
It shouldn't be wrong.

39:16.680 --> 39:19.640
Well, hope
is the Chinese doctor at Amity Hospital

39:19.640 --> 39:21.480
Not so incompetent.

39:33.160 --> 39:34.160
Good morning, Dr. Gu.

39:34.160 --> 39:34.880
Good morning.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.080
I heard you were almost injured

39:43.280 --> 39:44.640
Then translation will save you.

39:44.840 --> 39:45.840
You must know how to repay kindness.

39:46.160 --> 39:49.000
Now you buy more supplements
and take good care of him.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.840
When your term ends
and you return,

39:51.120 --> 39:52.840
Grandpa must be very grateful to him
.

39:57.520 --> 39:58.320
Okay, grandpa.

39:58.840 --> 40:01.520
I will try my best to bring him
home.

40:08.520 --> 40:09.960
Are you still your normal self today
?

40:10.400 --> 40:11.400
Oh, Bernal.

40:12.040 --> 40:12.560
Bibi.

40:13.520 --> 40:15.840
Please help me make
another breakfast today.

40:16.240 --> 40:17.200
Great, no problem.

40:17.520 --> 40:19.080
And this millet porridge.

40:19.520 --> 40:20.560
Give me some millet porridge.

40:21.120 --> 40:23.240
Don't you like to eat
millet porridge?

40:24.080 --> 40:25.640
This millet porridge is made for me.

40:26.040 --> 40:26.880
Isn’t this nutritious?

40:27.440 --> 40:28.440
Great, no problem.

40:28.520 --> 40:29.440
Add some pickles.

40:29.520 --> 40:30.520
OK

40:34.080 --> 40:35.040
Bibi.

40:35.600 --> 40:38.560
Fill the dumplings with filling and peel them

40:38.560 --> 40:40.520
Aren't you going to sell it?

40:40.680 --> 40:42.680
Those dumplings don't belong in our cafeteria.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.280
From skin to content

40:44.520 --> 40:46.120
Not
a penny of the organization's money is used.

40:46.400 --> 40:48.520
I made some myself
to quench my thirst.

40:49.520 --> 40:51.440
The content looks very delicious to me.

40:52.320 --> 40:52.960
That's right, right?

40:56.840 --> 40:57.840
Look at that small part.

40:57.840 --> 40:59.480
Not even enough for me.

41:02.760 --> 41:03.760
Bibi.

41:06.800 --> 41:08.040
OK

41:09.880 --> 41:11.440
How do you feel today?
do you feel better now?

41:11.520 --> 41:13.760
A nutritious breakfast per person.

41:14.120 --> 41:14.760
Eat quickly.

41:14.960 --> 41:15.320
Ayo.

41:15.360 --> 41:16.760
However, I haven't ordered a meal yet.

41:16.880 --> 41:18.960
No purchase required, it's free.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.960
Free? Since when has this been the case?

41:21.080 --> 41:22.760
One copy per patient in neurosurgery.

41:22.960 --> 41:23.960
Are you a patient?

41:24.200 --> 41:25.520
Is breakfast free for patients?

41:25.880 --> 41:28.520
This was the special service the doctor recommended for patient number two.

41:29.520 --> 41:30.520
special service?

41:31.520 --> 41:32.800
Come on, Vian, while it's hot.

41:33.120 --> 41:34.520
So there are also small dumplings?

41:35.600 --> 41:37.360
Auntie, I really miss this dish.

41:37.520 --> 41:38.520
I also want to eat dumplings.

41:38.680 --> 41:39.520
There is only one bowl.

41:39.760 --> 41:40.520
Doctor Fang.

41:40.760 --> 41:41.760
your breakfast

41:41.760 --> 41:42.640
In the cafeteria.

41:43.080 --> 41:45.480
Wait, my heart hurts.

41:45.520 --> 41:46.760
Come and see me now.

41:46.760 --> 41:48.240
I also want to eat dumplings.

41:49.960 --> 41:52.560
Eat
it while it's hot, as recommended by your doctor.

41:54.880 --> 41:56.360
It turns out you can eat dumplings in Lakaya.

41:56.360 --> 41:57.480
This can't happen.

41:58.560 --> 41:59.360
These little dumplings are

41:59.360 --> 42:00.520
Which doctor did you recommend?

42:00.840 --> 42:01.520
Boss,

42:02.000 --> 42:02.520
do you know?

42:03.960 --> 42:05.520
All I know is
that you don't have enough work right now.

42:06.040 --> 42:07.520
Hurry up and go through the procedures for extending the hospitalization time for Patient No. 2.

42:07.800 --> 42:08.800
Extend the course of treatment?

42:09.160 --> 42:10.120
Why extend?

42:10.440 --> 42:12.000
I just had a mild concussion.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.440
You can be discharged from the hospital tomorrow
, right?

42:14.520 --> 42:15.520
Continue to monitor

42:15.640 --> 42:17.520
Prevent delayed intracranial hemorrhage.

42:19.680 --> 42:21.240
However, I have recovered.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
I'm a doctor.

42:23.320 --> 42:24.240
This is what the doctor recommends.
