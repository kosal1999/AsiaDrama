14:26.120 --> 14:26.800
I lied.

14:26.960 --> 14:27.840
What is my boss saying?

14:30.000 --> 14:31.120
I want you to stay,

14:32.640 --> 14:33.880
Not because we need a translator,

14:35.080 --> 14:37.840
Not even because you know French and medicine.

14:40.240 --> 14:42.080
When I first met you in Lakaya

14:45.440 --> 14:48.000
I thought you were a
person who only pursues your own interests.

14:49.600 --> 14:52.840
medical deserter

14:57.880 --> 14:58.560
but

14:59.920 --> 15:03.080
When you talk about medical terminology,
you are familiar with it.

15:04.880 --> 15:06.400
you can do anything

15:07.280 --> 15:08.120
To save Saquon.

15:09.760 --> 15:10.600
Even you are in the way

15:11.520 --> 15:13.280
Between me and the stick,
between me and the gun.

15:20.480 --> 15:21.360
Su Wei'an.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.840
Do you remember that night at the pharmacy?

15:27.280 --> 15:29.960
It was as dark as it was now.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.400
You help me
arrange the letters on the bracelet.

15:36.320 --> 15:37.680
You look really beautiful

15:38.160 --> 15:39.880
Under the jacaranda tree

15:41.440 --> 15:42.440
When you take off your makeup.

15:46.160 --> 15:47.000
Doctor Gu.

15:48.720 --> 15:49.760
Don't be too sentimental.

15:50.840 --> 15:53.240
I did the things you said without thinking.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.800
If I saw someone today
in the situation you describe,

15:57.080 --> 15:59.080
I would do the same thing, I would put myself
between them and the danger.

16:04.840 --> 16:05.400
Wei'an.

16:06.720 --> 16:07.920
That New Year's kiss

16:09.760 --> 16:10.990
It wasn't just a kiss.

16:12.640 --> 16:13.600
I don't want to be just your friend.

16:13.600 --> 16:14.320
Basta.

16:24.910 --> 16:26.080
I know what you're going to say.

16:28.990 --> 16:30.080
Since the New Year's dance,

16:31.760 --> 16:32.720
I already know.

16:38.640 --> 16:39.680
I'm not stupid.

16:40.990 --> 16:42.520
I can see it in your eyes

16:43.680 --> 16:45.080
And hear it in your words.

16:46.390 --> 16:47.840
But I'm glad you didn't say it.

16:49.990 --> 16:50.990
so

16:53.950 --> 16:55.200
I can continue to act stupid.

16:57.760 --> 16:59.520
I have no patience for anything

17:00.200 --> 17:01.200
in medicine

17:01.200 --> 17:02.200
and in love.

17:03.160 --> 17:05.440
So, no matter
what impression I gave you before,

17:06.520 --> 17:08.120
Now I like Eliot,

17:08.800 --> 17:09.880
I will go to Paris with him.

17:11.920 --> 17:12.880
you understand?

17:15.080 --> 17:16.320
Do you like Eliot?

17:21.400 --> 17:22.240
Oh, really?

17:30.040 --> 17:31.200
It's not good to force things.

17:32.240 --> 17:33.880
For someone like me, it's not worth it.

17:36.480 --> 17:37.760
Stop wasting your time on me.

17:42.680 --> 17:44.080
Jiang, open the door.

17:44.600 --> 17:45.600
I know you're out there.

17:58.360 --> 17:59.120
Jiang.

18:00.200 --> 18:01.120
Are you asleep?

18:27.040 --> 18:28.480
The recorder is smart.

18:29.080 --> 18:30.760
I tagged
common terms used in neurosurgery

18:31.520 --> 18:33.040
in the dictionary.

18:35.400 --> 18:36.400
And that cream

18:37.200 --> 18:38.240
It's to relieve itching,

18:39.640 --> 18:40.640
People who have used it say
it works very well.

18:42.480 --> 18:43.280
Jiang.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.400
Fang Mingfan is very kind to you.

18:48.760 --> 18:50.120
You should appreciate it.

18:57.880 --> 18:58.800
(River.)

18:59.840 --> 19:00.600
(sorry.)

19:01.960 --> 19:04.240
(There's something I don't know how to tell you.)

19:05.680 --> 19:07.160
(I have to find a cure)

19:07.200 --> 19:08.480
(Before my condition worsened.)

19:10.120 --> 19:11.480
(I have to go to France.)

19:17.540 --> 19:21.140
【Friendship Hospital】

19:25.400 --> 19:26.240
Hilo.

19:27.120 --> 19:27.840
Hilo.

19:41.200 --> 19:42.200
Hemostatic gel.

19:43.480 --> 19:44.400
Hemostatic gel.

20:14.120 --> 20:15.280
The bleeding has stopped.

20:15.720 --> 20:16.360
Fang Mingfan.

20:17.600 --> 20:18.200
Close up of skull.

20:18.680 --> 20:19.360
OK

20:20.980 --> 20:21.600
boss.

20:22.380 --> 20:24.810
This is the last surgery of the day.

20:25.100 --> 20:26.240
I'll take care of the rest.

20:26.360 --> 20:26.880
You can go first.

20:27.280 --> 20:27.880
Where should I go?

20:29.280 --> 20:31.080
Wei An is probably already
on his way to the airport.

20:44.880 --> 20:46.200
Wei An, are you feeling uncomfortable?

20:48.320 --> 20:49.640
We are about to arrive at the airport.

20:50.880 --> 20:53.600
No, I'm thinking

20:54.320 --> 20:55.840
Significant changes in mice

20:55.840 --> 20:57.720
People who have received cell transplants
,

20:58.800 --> 20:59.720
As the material you showed me shows
.

21:01.480 --> 21:02.960
Dr. Marta should be ready

21:03.640 --> 21:05.520
Move your research
into clinical trials, right?

21:08.320 --> 21:09.160
perhaps.

21:11.680 --> 21:12.600
what happened?

21:13.600 --> 21:15.000
Is there any progress in research?

21:16.840 --> 21:17.680
oh

21:18.720 --> 21:19.880
Are they stagnant?

21:22.600 --> 21:24.720
In fact, in Paris,
there are many top laboratories.

21:25.400 --> 21:26.800
Dr. Marta is also studying

21:26.800 --> 21:28.720
Brain-computer interface
has huge potential.

21:29.160 --> 21:31.280
If you are interested,
I can help you coordinate.

21:32.160 --> 21:32.840
What do you mean?

21:35.040 --> 21:36.040
you know.

21:36.240 --> 21:38.360
I just want to join
the Huntington's Disease Project.

21:40.800 --> 21:41.800
Project Progress

21:41.800 --> 21:43.600
Huntington's disease develops
very slowly.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.880
You can join other
research groups

21:47.160 --> 21:48.510
While you wait for
the Huntington's Disease Project

21:48.510 --> 21:49.970
Entering the clinical stage,

21:50.200 --> 21:51.000
Then you join their team.

21:51.280 --> 21:51.760
No.

21:52.760 --> 21:53.800
I can't wait any longer.

21:58.200 --> 21:59.080
Because you can't wait?

21:59.760 --> 22:02.160
Why only Huntington’s disease?

22:32.680 --> 22:33.680
Why are you following me?

22:38.400 --> 22:39.600
This is what Wei An left for you.

22:43.040 --> 22:47.840
Immediately perform
an enhanced CT scan of the head.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.000
There is a mass in the brainstem.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.160

22:50.160 --> 22:52.120

22:55.240 --> 22:58.320

22:58.800 --> 23:00.200
This is a smart voice recorder.

23:00.560 --> 23:01.720
When you say a keyword,

23:01.720 --> 23:03.480
Autoplay with
corresponding French translation.

23:04.200 --> 23:06.200
Wei An has compiled your most commonly used phrases

23:06.280 --> 23:07.760
According to your work manual,

23:08.120 --> 23:09.400
And spent several nights recording them.

23:18.160 --> 23:20.600
There may be traffic jams on the way to the airport now.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.400
I think you'd get there faster on a motorcycle.

23:24.960 --> 23:25.960
What do you mean?

23:26.120 --> 23:27.200
I mean,

23:27.200 --> 23:29.600
If you don't leave soon, you won't find her.

23:32.200 --> 23:34.520
She said she must
go to France with Elliot.

23:35.800 --> 23:37.000
Why should I go to her?

23:38.640 --> 23:41.640
This is a question only you can answer
.

23:44.040 --> 23:45.240
Doctor Gu, do you know?

23:45.680 --> 23:47.680
Wei An once filled in a textbook

23:47.680 --> 23:49.080
And your name.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.040
After I found out, he explained to me

23:52.480 --> 23:55.600
She wants to be a doctor like you.

23:56.200 --> 23:58.600
But do you believe this?

24:00.240 --> 24:01.720
I have never seen any doctor

24:01.720 --> 24:04.240
Fill a book with the name of Hippocrates.

24:07.200 --> 24:08.040

I can't take you to Paris.

30:21.120 --> 30:21.720
he's gone.

31:04.160 --> 31:05.840
I found your motorcycle.

31:09.440 --> 31:10.640
When I found her,

31:11.800 --> 31:12.840
I was completely devastated.

31:13.680 --> 31:16.440
I fixed it piece by piece.

31:20.040 --> 31:21.280
you can fix

31:22.600 --> 31:23.800
Is something broken?

31:24.480 --> 31:25.400
if I could.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
I can fix anything that's broken.

31:30.640 --> 31:31.840
Even to me?

31:35.480 --> 31:36.320
That?

31:43.200 --> 31:43.800
anything.

31:53.520 --> 31:54.160

32:01.800 --> 32:02.680
I returned it to its owner.

32:03.230 --> 32:03.800
from now on,

32:04.200 --> 32:05.350
Don't lose it again.
