【Love is a panacea】
【Episode 8】

01:25.980 --> 01:27.980
[Works funded by Sichuan Province Major Literary Project in 2022]

01:27.980 --> 01:29.980
[Adapted from the Ningmeng language novel "Love is the Panacea"]

01:34.100 --> 01:35.980
Su Wei'an already has it

01:37.300 --> 01:39.020
Have you had any illnesses before?

01:41.980 --> 01:42.900
No.

01:46.460 --> 01:47.340
Where is her family?

01:49.460 --> 01:50.700
Are there genetic diseases?

01:50.700 --> 01:52.500
In her family?

01:55.540 --> 01:56.300
No.

01:57.500 --> 01:59.460
Before going to college, Wei An and I

01:59.460 --> 02:01.020
We did a physical exam together.

02:01.140 --> 02:02.300
She is in good health.

02:02.700 --> 02:05.540
His father died in a car accident.

02:06.060 --> 02:08.180
Before his death, he
ran a marathon every year

02:08.180 --> 02:09.300
and enjoy good health.

02:09.940 --> 02:11.940
Her mother
participates in square dancing every day

02:12.300 --> 02:13.300
It's also very healthy.

02:14.940 --> 02:16.140
why do you ask?

02:20.540 --> 02:21.220
anything.

02:26.140 --> 02:26.580
Dr. Xu.

02:26.580 --> 02:27.140
How is it going?

02:27.300 --> 02:27.740
How is it going?

02:28.060 --> 02:28.660
Don't worry.

02:29.220 --> 02:30.180
No damage to organs.

02:31.580 --> 02:32.260
only

02:32.540 --> 02:34.300
The wound was deep
and there was a lot of blood loss.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.300
I gave him
800 ml of blood transfusion.

02:36.300 --> 02:37.300
She remains in a coma.

02:38.300 --> 02:39.340
She will be transferred
to the infirmary for observation.

02:39.980 --> 02:41.340
Can we go see her now?

02:42.580 --> 02:43.300
It's so late.

02:43.780 --> 02:44.860
Let her rest well.

02:45.340 --> 02:46.580
There is a nurse on duty in the ward

02:47.180 --> 02:47.980
Who will take good care of her.

02:50.940 --> 02:51.860
By the way, Dr. Xu,

02:52.740 --> 02:54.940
please do this

02:55.300 --> 02:56.460
Whole body CT scan

02:56.860 --> 02:57.940
or MRI.

02:58.300 --> 02:59.700
Also, check out
your heart ultrasound,

03:03.100 --> 03:05.340
Blood routine
, tumor markers, etc.

03:07.180 --> 03:08.660
Give him a complete physical exam.

03:10.300 --> 03:11.260
some problems?

03:14.220 --> 03:15.540
Do you doubt
my medical skills?

03:15.740 --> 03:16.300
No.

03:18.740 --> 03:19.980
And one more thing

03:20.460 --> 03:21.500
I need to confirm this.

03:23.940 --> 03:24.580
OK

03:25.180 --> 03:26.180
I will issue
the medical examination documents.

03:30.300 --> 03:30.940
PhD. Gu.

03:31.980 --> 03:33.820
Why do you need to
come to Wei'an for a physical examination?

03:35.300 --> 03:36.940
You are with her every day.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.940
Has she been acting strangely lately?

03:41.620 --> 03:42.340
No.

03:44.140 --> 03:45.300
Doctor Gu, don't scare me.

03:45.780 --> 03:46.820
What happened to Wei An?

03:48.100 --> 03:49.100
She is sick?

03:53.060 --> 03:54.020
Hope not.

04:04.620 --> 04:06.140
(I'm not dead yet.)

04:07.770 --> 04:09.050
(I am saved.)

04:10.780 --> 04:12.500
(I must live a good life.)

04:15.060 --> 04:16.180
Sue, you wake up.

04:16.740 --> 04:17.380
how are you feeling?

04:18.180 --> 04:18.820
much better.

04:21.180 --> 04:22.580
Thank you Dr. Xu.

04:23.860 --> 04:25.820
Your superb medical skills
saved my life again.

04:26.260 --> 04:27.540
You don't need to thank me.

04:28.260 --> 04:30.780
Just thank you Dr. Gu.

04:31.380 --> 04:32.900
He was very anxious when he saw something happened to you.

04:33.820 --> 04:35.700
neurosurgeon

04:35.700 --> 04:37.140
They've seen it all.

04:37.660 --> 04:40.100
Why
was he so panicked when he saw blood?

04:49.180 --> 04:51.460
But he didn't come to see me.

04:52.020 --> 04:52.900
last night

04:53.180 --> 04:55.220
He waited until
the operation was over

04:55.740 --> 04:57.660
It was good to see you before he comes back.

05:14.780 --> 05:15.620
Where is my bag?

05:17.340 --> 05:18.620
Have you seen my bag?

05:18.820 --> 05:19.380
What bag?

05:19.620 --> 05:21.060
My carry-on bag.

05:22.180 --> 05:23.180
All my stuff...

05:23.460 --> 05:24.220
Do not move.

05:24.420 --> 05:25.220
You just had surgery.

05:26.180 --> 05:26.820
listen.

05:26.820 --> 05:29.060
This way the wound
will open easily.

05:29.380 --> 05:30.180
I remember that lady Jiang

05:30.660 --> 05:33.020
I was holding that bag yesterday.

05:33.380 --> 05:34.780
It won't be lost. Don't worry.

05:35.260 --> 05:36.500
Take a good rest first.

05:36.820 --> 05:37.540
Thanks.

05:42.580 --> 05:44.110
(Su Weian’s test results
were all normal.)

05:44.380 --> 05:45.700
(A hard copy
will be sent to you this afternoon.)

05:47.860 --> 05:49.380
(What's up with her?)

05:50.940 --> 05:51.740
Cefinho.

05:52.980 --> 05:53.660
Cefinho.

05:55.460 --> 05:56.380
And Sirta. they are

05:58.420 --> 05:58.940
Sim.

06:02.260 --> 06:02.780
Cefinho.

06:03.940 --> 06:05.180
Did you hear me?

06:05.940 --> 06:07.180
And Sirta. they are

06:07.300 --> 06:07.980
He remembers.

06:10.900 --> 06:11.780
Don't you want to see her?

06:12.100 --> 06:13.820
The brain tumor patient we admitted yesterday

06:13.820 --> 06:15.180
Surgery is expected tonight.

06:15.780 --> 06:17.100
Are you prepared before the surgery?

06:18.260 --> 06:19.180
Cefinho.

06:19.460 --> 06:20.900
miss. Sue is hurt

06:21.020 --> 06:21.940
And a lot of blood was shed.

06:22.180 --> 06:23.780
You were too anxious last night.

06:24.300 --> 06:25.540
Why do you
act like nothing happened today?

06:25.900 --> 06:26.660
I've thought about this.

06:27.060 --> 06:28.660
She eventually committed suicide.

06:29.340 --> 06:30.340
I don't want to see her now.

06:36.060 --> 06:37.980
(Vian, have you ever thought about it)

06:38.420 --> 06:40.100
(What should I do if you die?)

06:42.420 --> 06:42.980
River,

06:43.820 --> 06:44.740
I have good news for you.

06:45.060 --> 06:45.860
miss. Awakened.

06:46.100 --> 06:47.220
What does this have to do with me?

06:49.860 --> 06:51.420
Aren't you best friends?

06:52.260 --> 06:54.460
Why don't you take care of her?

06:56.700 --> 06:57.460
I don't plan to.

06:57.780 --> 06:59.260
She doesn't need
anyone's attention.

06:59.260 --> 07:01.220
I have work to do.
Don't block my way.

07:06.180 --> 07:07.180
What's wrong?

07:07.200 --> 07:09.040
【Friendship Hospital】

07:09.980 --> 07:10.620
take this medicine

07:11.700 --> 07:13.460
Twice a day.

07:14.020 --> 07:14.860
that's it.

07:16.180 --> 07:17.660
Will Eastow of Vian.

07:18.620 --> 07:19.580
Stop this.

07:19.780 --> 07:21.180
Inside is
Vivian's underwear.

07:22.660 --> 07:23.620
Why did you give them to me?

07:23.780 --> 07:24.740
I don't think it's appropriate for me to have them handed to me.

07:24.740 --> 07:25.980
Just give it to her!

07:45.980 --> 07:46.620
Cefinho.

07:52.060 --> 07:53.860
What a guy you are.

07:54.420 --> 07:55.780
You said you don't care,
Miss Sue,

07:56.420 --> 07:57.380
So what are you doing here?

07:58.820 --> 07:59.460
lips

08:00.660 --> 08:01.660
They are a bit dry.

08:03.180 --> 08:04.180
Prepare a box of cotton swabs.

08:06.740 --> 08:07.780
Everything is there.

08:28.500 --> 08:29.380
Are you awake?

08:30.180 --> 08:31.180
Because is you?

08:32.660 --> 08:34.420
Some people say your lips
are dry

08:34.940 --> 08:35.780
and ask

08:36.540 --> 08:38.460
Let me rub them.

08:38.460 --> 08:39.180
anyone there?

08:40.540 --> 08:41.340
WHO？

08:44.060 --> 08:45.460
I can't say.

08:46.420 --> 08:47.180
Gu Yunzheng?

08:49.540 --> 08:52.180
I can't help
you think this way.

08:57.820 --> 08:58.340
That...

09:00.740 --> 09:01.780
all these are

09:02.180 --> 09:03.180
Your personal clothes.

09:05.180 --> 09:06.020
Don't get me wrong.

09:06.020 --> 09:07.980
I was asked
to give them to you.

09:08.180 --> 09:09.180
Someone else?

09:10.500 --> 09:11.180
Jiang?

09:14.340 --> 09:15.420
I did not say anything.

09:19.580 --> 09:21.180
Why these
people who commissioned it

09:22.220 --> 09:23.820
Won't you come to see me?

09:24.740 --> 09:26.220
This is because they are
too busy working

09:28.220 --> 09:29.660
Or don't you want to see me?

09:32.180 --> 09:33.180
I have no idea.

09:34.340 --> 09:35.460
get well soon.

09:36.020 --> 09:36.740
and then

09:36.900 --> 09:37.860
Ask them yourself.

09:39.820 --> 09:40.740
in this case,

09:41.380 --> 09:43.420
do something for them

09:43.780 --> 09:44.740
for me.

10:25.820 --> 10:26.860
Is anyone?

10:26.940 --> 10:27.860
Socorro!

10:27.900 --> 10:29.140
Jiang, it’s me.

10:29.820 --> 10:30.500
it's me.

10:33.700 --> 10:34.620
Fang Mingfan!

10:35.540 --> 10:36.580
Are you crazy?

10:36.940 --> 10:38.620
Why did you break into the girls' dormitory in the middle of the night?

10:38.820 --> 10:40.060
Do you want to scare me to death?

10:41.020 --> 10:41.860
someone said

10:42.660 --> 10:44.020
Who's afraid you'll forget
to turn off the fan?

10:44.540 --> 10:45.700
and let me take a look

10:46.020 --> 10:47.020
In case you catch a cold.

10:47.460 --> 10:48.380
anyone there?

10:48.580 --> 10:49.620
WHO？

10:51.620 --> 10:53.380
Just one person.

10:57.040 --> 10:59.200
【Friendship Hospital】

11:11.180 --> 11:12.180
Fang Mingfan!

11:16.940 --> 11:18.580
What did you give me to drink?

11:20.060 --> 11:21.500
What a dark thing.

11:21.500 --> 11:23.420
Is it mud?

11:26.180 --> 11:27.380
I know.

11:27.380 --> 11:30.500
This is
a rare coffee bean from someone's private collection.

11:30.860 --> 11:32.660
But I don't know how to grind
coffee beans or brew coffee.

11:32.940 --> 11:33.940
It's like being spoiled.

11:35.940 --> 11:37.180
You guys are so annoying.

11:37.500 --> 11:38.900
Serving them is very difficult.

11:39.180 --> 11:41.020
I had to
enter the service industry as a surgeon

11:41.540 --> 11:42.740
And keep your secrets.

11:43.820 --> 11:44.580
It's too difficult for me.

11:50.660 --> 11:52.180
She may
have had her stitches removed.

11:53.340 --> 11:54.220
Congratulations.

11:54.780 --> 11:56.180
Your career in the service industry

11:56.420 --> 11:57.860
It must end here.

11:58.220 --> 11:59.860
Wei An's report
will come to fruition as soon as possible.

12:01.620 --> 12:04.540
All indicators are normal.

12:04.540 --> 12:05.940
Not just normal,

12:06.260 --> 12:08.100
But she is healthier than me.

12:14.220 --> 12:14.980
PhD. Gu.

12:18.460 --> 12:19.220
Take your medicine.

12:21.820 --> 12:23.060
How could you give me
such medicine?

12:28.100 --> 12:28.740
This is

12:30.020 --> 12:31.180
This is your medical report.

12:31.700 --> 12:32.420
Take a look.

12:36.220 --> 12:37.700
When did I have a physical exam?

12:38.660 --> 12:39.700
Su Wei'an.

12:42.020 --> 12:44.020
I thought you had
a terminal illness

12:44.660 --> 12:46.900
Do whatever it takes to die.

12:47.620 --> 12:48.740
It seems I was wrong.

12:49.940 --> 12:50.940
You are very healthy.

12:55.180 --> 12:56.660
I saw your insurance policy.

13:04.220 --> 13:05.460
Everyone is doomed.

13:06.340 --> 13:07.460
Or you can get 100,000 yuan
in compensation,

13:07.860 --> 13:08.860
Or you could receive a million.

13:09.700 --> 13:11.220
I want to see how much I can get
in return.

13:11.540 --> 13:13.540
You won't get a penny.

13:13.540 --> 13:14.420
Who said that?

13:15.100 --> 13:15.940
Su Wei'an.

13:17.060 --> 13:18.980
If you commit suicide like this again

13:19.540 --> 13:21.660
I will definitely report it to the insurance company

13:21.660 --> 13:22.500
To cheat.

13:22.500 --> 13:23.620
I'll do what I'm told.

13:23.860 --> 13:25.940
What is a lie?

13:28.500 --> 13:29.380
also,

13:30.340 --> 13:31.780
Who said I committed suicide?

13:32.180 --> 13:33.780
But this is not
helping others for righteous reasons.

13:34.460 --> 13:35.740
You just want to die.

13:38.900 --> 13:41.500
Ever since you dropped out of school
and came to Lacaha

13:41.940 --> 13:43.180
until everything happened

13:43.620 --> 13:45.540
Ever since I met him,

13:46.140 --> 13:47.460
i finally realized

13:47.460 --> 13:49.060
what are you up to.

13:49.780 --> 13:51.780
Instead of watching you try to commit suicide every day,

13:52.020 --> 13:54.180
I make better use of my expertise

13:56.810 --> 13:57.810
Come and help her.

13:58.580 --> 13:59.460
what do you want to do?

14:03.300 --> 14:05.620
You just want to be euthanized
.

14:06.370 --> 14:09.140
Now you no longer need to think about
going to Switzerland.

14:09.940 --> 14:11.330
The medicine I just gave you

14:11.980 --> 14:13.620
Will make your wishes
come true.

14:15.100 --> 14:16.100
Wait for you...

14:18.780 --> 14:19.460
it's no use.

14:20.100 --> 14:22.460
It dissolves as soon as you take it.

14:23.020 --> 14:24.500
Have I angered you?

14:24.810 --> 14:25.580
this medicine

14:26.300 --> 14:28.940
Made from resin mixture

14:29.300 --> 14:30.330

14:30.740 --> 14:31.740

and rooster's blood.

14:36.220 --> 14:37.740

the pain of illness.

Just eat it

14:44.660 --> 14:47.100
You will
die peacefully in your sleep,

14:47.660 --> 14:48.980
without having the disease.

14:49.340 --> 14:51.060
What a mystery.

14:52.340 --> 14:53.420
It's obviously witchcraft,

14:54.300 --> 14:55.740
Not poison.

14:56.540 --> 14:57.660
It's not actually poison.

14:58.540 --> 15:01.100
This is the medicine for happiness

15:02.180 --> 15:02.900
This can help
people who want to have euthanasia.

15:07.460 --> 15:10.460
you feel hot

15:12.540 --> 15:13.620
and a little

15:14.540 --> 15:15.740
Headquarters

15:16.380 --> 15:17.380
Want to drink water?

15:23.660 --> 15:24.380
It's working.

15:25.180 --> 15:26.540
You're going to kill me.

15:27.300 --> 15:28.660
For a healthy person,

15:28.660 --> 15:30.180
Drogamata

15:30.300 --> 15:31.540
But for you,

15:32.180 --> 15:33.020
that's just

15:33.660 --> 15:34.820
help.

15:37.180 --> 15:38.100
You must be lying to me.

15:39.460 --> 15:40.180
I'm not telling lies.

15:41.100 --> 15:41.820
Su Wei'an,

15:43.020 --> 15:43.900
idea

15:44.660 --> 15:45.900
You will die for me.

15:47.380 --> 15:48.980
But now I understand.

15:50.100 --> 15:51.500
You can die anytime, anywhere
,

15:51.500 --> 15:53.020
a strange child,

15:53.460 --> 15:55.100
Or anything.

15:55.820 --> 15:56.700
What's important

15:57.460 --> 15:58.260
You didn't do this
for no reason

15:59.860 --> 16:01.340
But he just wanted to die.

16:02.780 --> 16:03.420
Don't worry.

16:04.660 --> 16:05.980
after you die,

16:07.220 --> 16:08.220
I will dissect it

16:08.860 --> 16:11.100
I'll sell all your organs

16:11.580 --> 16:13.100
Not a black market.

16:13.820 --> 16:15.060
In view of our friendship,

16:15.660 --> 16:17.180
I'll transfer all the money

16:17.180 --> 16:18.340
To your mother.

16:25.820 --> 16:26.260
OK

16:27.780 --> 16:28.660
Anyway,

16:29.500 --> 16:30.660
After I die, you will not be able to escape the punishment of the law.

16:30.980 --> 16:33.540
So I'm giving up my life

16:33.700 --> 16:34.380
For you.

16:43.780 --> 16:44.860
Su Wei'an, what are you doing?

16:45.220 --> 16:46.380
Don't do that!

16:46.540 --> 16:48.100
See you!

16:50.140 --> 16:51.060
See you!

16:51.820 --> 16:52.940
There are still six hours until the game.

16:54.220 --> 16:54.860
He listens to me.

16:56.380 --> 16:57.580
The best thing about this medicine
is,

16:57.580 --> 16:59.260
After taking it,

16:59.260 --> 17:02.060
His organs will soon fail,

17:02.580 --> 17:04.540
Unless you
drink a lot of water now

17:04.980 --> 17:06.420
To dilute toxins in the body.

17:15.580 --> 17:16.380
Don't you want to die?

17:21.820 --> 17:23.220
say loudly

17:24.220 --> 17:25.340
You don't want to die.

17:29.380 --> 17:29.860
explain!

17:35.660 --> 17:36.340
explain!

17:39.260 --> 17:40.100
I don't want to die.

17:40.420 --> 17:41.500
I want to live. all good?

17:45.260 --> 17:46.380
Why do you want to live?

17:47.940 --> 17:48.660
tell me why.

17:49.220 --> 17:49.860
Once you tell me,

17:50.700 --> 17:51.660
I'll give you water.

17:52.380 --> 17:53.220
I'll give you the antidote too.

17:59.220 --> 18:00.260
An extra year of life is a victory.

18:01.260 --> 18:03.580
Wouldn't it be such a waste to die so quickly?

18:04.500 --> 18:05.980
And my mother is still
waiting for me at home.

18:08.340 --> 18:08.780
OK

18:10.700 --> 18:12.460
I admit that I am afraid of death.

18:13.460 --> 18:14.100
everything is fine?

18:26.900 --> 18:27.540
Antidote.

18:31.560 --> 18:33.000
[iron-containing tablets]

18:36.140 --> 18:37.140
Iron sheets.

18:37.780 --> 18:39.460
Gu Yunzheng,
is it so fun to lie to me?

18:44.660 --> 18:45.340
Su Wei'an.

18:46.540 --> 18:47.620
you haven't thought about it

18:47.620 --> 18:49.020
What happens after you die?

18:50.100 --> 18:50.820
you organized

18:51.900 --> 18:54.100
Your last words,
bank card

18:55.460 --> 18:57.580
And the insurance policy is clear.

18:59.700 --> 19:00.700
but

19:01.900 --> 19:03.020
what would you do

19:03.300 --> 19:05.380
if these are

19:06.980 --> 19:07.780
The last six hours of your life?

19:11.380 --> 19:12.140
that is not...

19:13.460 --> 19:14.580
No matter if,

19:15.220 --> 19:17.220
I hope you remember
what I said today.

19:18.140 --> 19:19.140
You don't want to die.

19:19.700 --> 19:20.540
You want to live.

19:23.020 --> 19:25.380
I saved your life.

19:26.900 --> 19:28.340
I hope to start from today

19:28.820 --> 19:30.220
You can take care of
yourself.

19:31.540 --> 19:33.580
Stop despising your life like this.

19:36.820 --> 19:39.220
Bring an umbrella when it rains.

19:40.780 --> 19:41.460
wear more clothes

19:42.260 --> 19:43.460
When it's cold.

19:45.580 --> 19:47.220
if you are sick,

19:48.580 --> 19:49.580
I won't let her go.

20:08.780 --> 20:09.780
have a good rest.

20:18.820 --> 20:21.660
Remember to take
iron tablets.

20:22.660 --> 20:23.660
You are anemic.

20:31.220 --> 20:32.100
PhD. Gu.

20:32.660 --> 20:33.820
How about Vian?

20:35.380 --> 20:36.460
I think she is very good.

20:37.340 --> 20:38.060
I hope

20:38.260 --> 20:40.340
She actually listened to me.

21:00.460 --> 21:01.460
Jiang.

21:02.140 --> 21:03.540
You finally came to see me.

21:05.020 --> 21:06.220
I miss you.

21:15.700 --> 21:18.020
Do you feel pain?

21:20.260 --> 21:21.900
There is a hole in my stomach.

21:24.100 --> 21:25.780
I need a beautiful woman
to hold me.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.380
you know what you told me

21:29.380 --> 21:30.540
That evening?

21:32.220 --> 21:33.460
European Union...

21:35.340 --> 21:37.540
Did I tell you my bank card password?

21:40.980 --> 21:42.340
Can you forget her?

21:53.660 --> 21:54.340
Wei'an.

21:56.340 --> 21:57.700
When we were still in school,

21:58.460 --> 21:59.460
you told me,

22:00.460 --> 22:02.820
Let’s go to Iceland together
to see the Northern Lights in the future

22:03.260 --> 22:06.140
We will go to
all the milk tea shops in Gimhae together.

22:07.220 --> 22:08.580
No matter
who gets married first,

22:08.780 --> 22:11.100
We will be each other's bridesmaids

22:11.900 --> 22:13.380
and godmother to the children.

22:14.980 --> 22:16.140
When we get old,

22:16.700 --> 22:18.780
Let's retire together

22:19.100 --> 22:21.540
In a place facing the sea.

22:24.100 --> 22:25.820
I take it seriously

22:26.300 --> 22:27.740
Everything you said.

22:30.340 --> 22:31.220
But what about you?

22:32.820 --> 22:35.100
You arrived at Lakaha without saying a word.

22:35.500 --> 22:38.140
He went to the police station
and was stabbed.

22:38.260 --> 22:40.500
He told me he was going to run away with Elliot.

22:40.660 --> 22:41.380
Jiang.

22:41.380 --> 22:42.740
hang on. Listen to me first.

22:42.900 --> 22:44.260
I just want to ask

22:44.500 --> 22:46.060
If you consider my feelings

22:46.060 --> 22:47.900
Before making a decision?

22:48.260 --> 22:49.100
You still consider me a friend

22:50.540 --> 22:52.220
in your heart?

22:56.220 --> 22:57.700
You feel

22:57.700 --> 22:58.740
what would i do

22:58.980 --> 23:00.220
and

23:02.100 --> 23:03.540
will you die?

23:04.730 --> 23:07.100
What do I say to your mother?

23:07.100 --> 23:08.020
Jiang.

23:09.620 --> 23:10.540
Really sorry.

23:13.900 --> 23:14.900
I know I'm stupid

23:15.500 --> 23:16.220
it's useless,

23:17.380 --> 23:19.740
I'm with you every day,

23:20.740 --> 23:21.900
There is absolutely nothing I can do.

23:22.380 --> 23:24.100
I am your burden.

23:28.380 --> 23:29.020
Jiang.

23:30.140 --> 23:31.140
This is not true.

23:34.020 --> 23:34.780
He listens to me.

23:34.780 --> 23:36.020
Parley, Vian.

23:36.740 --> 23:38.140
I made a decision.

23:40.860 --> 23:43.220
I will buy a ticket and
return to China in a few days.

23:47.260 --> 23:48.540
We have all grown up.

23:50.860 --> 23:52.100
I won't be attached to you anymore.

23:54.860 --> 23:55.780
River!

24:27.500 --> 24:28.340
So you're afraid you won't wake up

24:28.740 --> 24:30.100
If not, are they?

24:32.900 --> 24:34.140
I've been lying down for a long time

24:34.460 --> 24:35.500
I want to breathe some air.

24:40.980 --> 24:41.740
let's go.

24:42.780 --> 24:44.020
I will go with you.

24:47.500 --> 24:48.220
no need.

24:49.020 --> 24:50.220
Things weren't that dramatic.

24:50.380 --> 24:51.740
It’s not that I can’t walk.

25:12.860 --> 25:13.980
What are you doing?

25:18.780 --> 25:19.780
I'll take you to a place.

25:50.780 --> 25:51.780
you know

25:52.220 --> 25:53.340
What does a glioma specialist do?

25:53.780 --> 25:55.140
What does it mean for me?

25:57.740 --> 25:59.740
So you
pushed me here in the middle of the night

26:46.620 --> 26:47.620
But I don't dare.

26:48.620 --> 26:50.380
Because there's always a voice in the background

26:50.380 --> 26:51.620

26:52.380 --> 26:54.620
They will leave this world soon .

27:32.540 --> 27:33.540
Its
NMR results

27:34.220 --> 27:35.740
showed
a particularly poor prognosis.

27:57.620 --> 27:58.620
Actually,

27:59.380 --> 28:00.500
There are many other examples

28:00.620 --> 28:02.780
people like this

28:02.780 --> 28:04.380
Those who refuse to surrender to death.

28:05.220 --> 28:06.660
No matter
how critical the situation is,

Some people never give up.

take your life seriously?

the red oil hotpot.

32:38.580 --> 32:40.180
Cook the tripe seven times upwards
and eight times downwards.

32:40.940 --> 32:42.620
The longer it goes,
the more difficult it becomes.

32:45.460 --> 32:46.580
It is difficult to chew
and tastes bad.

32:46.580 --> 32:47.900
Better to throw it away.

32:51.740 --> 32:52.860
I'll eat it myself

33:02.460 --> 33:03.180

and minced garlic

it will be difficult to digest

34:13.700 --> 34:14.420

34:14.740 --> 34:17.740
Coca-Cola and hotpot go well together,
just like us.

34:18.700 --> 34:20.900
The bubbles of Coca-Cola
add to the pain of spice.

42:27.780 --> 42:28.940
So we won't buy it.

Sim.

42:46.860 --> 42:47.620
How much?

42:47.700 --> 42:48.700
$280.

42:49.740 --> 42:51.620
Your boyfriend is so nice.

42:52.860 --> 42:55.940
No, he is not my boyfriend.
