to arrive at the hospital smoothly,

27:25.000 --> 27:25.800
Fang Mingfan,

27:26.320 --> 27:27.880
Where is the blood test report I asked you to get?

27:28.480 --> 27:29.040
Give me that.

27:33.960 --> 27:34.960
Wei 'an!

27:35.920 --> 27:36.640
River!

27:36.640 --> 27:37.960
Oh my god. How are you?

27:37.960 --> 27:38.560
I am fine.

27:38.560 --> 27:39.640
I am anxious!

27:39.640 --> 27:40.600
Where is the doctor I asked you to find?

27:40.840 --> 27:41.800
over there.

27:42.400 --> 27:44.040
I didn't even waste a minute.

27:44.640 --> 27:46.120
He is a very handsome Chinese doctor.

28:03.880 --> 28:04.920
PhD. Gu.

28:05.600 --> 28:08.760

have been received.

28:09.200 --> 28:10.240
You're ready to go.

28:10.440 --> 28:11.480
That gentleman,

28:11.480 --> 28:13.240
Is he okay now?

28:13.240 --> 28:14.440
you are wrong.

28:14.840 --> 28:16.080
She is not a gentleman.

28:16.200 --> 28:18.480
It's that crazy woman over there.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
It's you!

28:30.560 --> 28:31.560
Dr. Gu, the world is really small.

28:34.200 --> 28:35.720
Thank you for vouching for me.

28:46.120 --> 28:47.120
Are you a doctor?

28:48.440 --> 28:49.440
She is a medical student studying

28:49.600 --> 28:51.880
Studied at Huaren Medical University for eight years
and obtained a doctorate. Cool, right?

28:53.240 --> 28:54.720
Are you a doctoral student at Huaren?

28:55.200 --> 28:56.320
Yes.

28:57.080 --> 28:58.960
But why are you
working as an unlicensed taxi driver here?

29:03.120 --> 29:04.120
What year did you go to school?

29:04.880 --> 29:06.120
How long has it been since you graduated?

29:10.440 --> 29:11.800
I didn't graduate.

29:11.960 --> 29:13.040
I dropped out of school.

29:13.120 --> 29:15.280
What? Why?

29:17.440 --> 29:20.480
Then you have no clinical experience

29:21.400 --> 29:23.160
and did not receive

29:23.160 --> 29:25.480
Provide remote professional guidance in first aid earlier.

29:25.520 --> 29:27.080
I obtained
my medical license.

29:27.160 --> 29:28.880
I have
specialized training in neurosurgery.

29:28.920 --> 29:30.280
That means no experience.

29:33.640 --> 29:35.800
Aren't you afraid of
making mistakes?

29:35.800 --> 29:36.920
In your previous actions,

29:37.040 --> 29:38.680
Caused the patient to die on the spot?

29:40.680 --> 29:41.760
If that's the case,

29:41.760 --> 29:43.200
How will you take responsibility?

29:43.400 --> 29:45.000
He's still alive, isn't he?

29:45.360 --> 29:46.680
You're just lucky.

29:50.280 --> 29:51.280
No wonder you dropped out of school.

29:53.240 --> 29:55.000
I think you have no respect

29:55.240 --> 29:56.600
For medicine or human life.

30:00.040 --> 30:01.400
Don't worry!

30:01.600 --> 30:03.360
If he dies,
I will compensate him with my life.

30:04.160 --> 30:05.880
Isn’t your life life?

30:06.080 --> 30:08.000
What is human life for?

30:08.120 --> 30:09.160
What does it mean to you?

30:09.640 --> 30:10.800
Is this the case with Huaren Medical University?

30:10.800 --> 30:12.080
Teach you to be responsible

30:12.720 --> 30:14.160
For human life?

30:22.720 --> 30:25.160
Just sign your name and you're good to go.

30:39.560 --> 30:41.360
Are you that Gu Yunzheng from Huaren?

30:42.920 --> 30:43.880
Thanks.

Isn’t Gu Yunzheng your teacher...

30:54.680 --> 30:56.240
What happened to that man?

30:56.240 --> 30:57.200
Did he pass out?

30:57.200 --> 30:58.200
He had a seizure.

30:58.400 --> 31:00.080
He is lucky
to have young Dr. Su here.

31:00.080 --> 31:01.560
He is now taken to hospital.

31:01.640 --> 31:02.880
PhD. yes?

31:04.560 --> 31:05.440
This is not accurate.

31:05.640 --> 31:07.520
She is a student at Huaren Medical University.

31:17.440 --> 31:18.960
She forgot to bring her book.

31:20.400 --> 31:22.400
This was the last subject for her final exam.

31:58.720 --> 31:59.720
You still remember me.

I haven't seen many
students who are absent from exams

32:04.320 --> 32:05.640

32:11.640 --> 32:13.760
I thought you would make
an excellent doctor

32:14.720 --> 32:16.360
But I didn't expect you to drop out of school.

32:19.040 --> 32:20.160
Why did you drop out of school?

32:23.920 --> 32:25.760
Studying medicine is too difficult and
there is no money.

32:26.040 --> 32:27.400
So I gave up.

32:35.560 --> 32:37.320

OK?

Are you bargaining?

32:48.200 --> 32:48.680
OK?

Hey guy,

34:35.360 --> 34:37.120
Do you still have Maotai in your store?

34:37.190 --> 34:38.920
Those bottles of Moutai I ordered for you last month,

34:39.280 --> 34:40.230
Can I buy it back?

34:40.600 --> 34:42.040
Have you finished all three boxes?

34:42.040 --> 34:43.040

- My fault.

35:27.280 --> 35:28.880

35:30.640 --> 35:31.320
- Now I...
- Stop.

36:11.960 --> 36:13.200

36:15.240 --> 36:16.760
It’s hard work and not profitable, right?

36:16.760 --> 36:17.440
Yes.

36:17.880 --> 36:20.400

36:20.440 --> 36:21.600
Don't lie to me!

36:23.000 --> 36:26.840
You've wanted to be a doctor since you were a kid.

36:27.080 --> 36:28.320

36:28.320 --> 36:29.640
Do you think you have no money to buy medicine?

36:29.640 --> 36:30.640
So you want to give up.

36:30.760 --> 36:32.480
Su Wei'an, do you think I really believe it?

36:33.000 --> 36:34.600
And you, Su Wei'an,

36:34.680 --> 36:36.280

person who loves money.

36:36.360 --> 36:37.440
I do love money,

and risk your life.

36:43.080 --> 36:44.920

what happened to your thesis that year?

36:45.080 --> 36:46.360
of course not.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.720
Or is it because of your father's accident?

37:01.040 --> 37:02.440
People will change.

37:03.800 --> 37:05.720
I just want to make money now.

37:05.720 --> 37:07.000
I want to enjoy life.

37:07.280 --> 37:09.520
I don't want
to suffer every day in that medical school

37:09.560 --> 37:11.200
And working hard
but not making much money.

37:11.480 --> 37:12.320
you should not

37:12.320 --> 37:13.880
It’s such a hard struggle here. All right?

37:13.920 --> 37:15.000
Come back to China with me.

37:20.400 --> 37:21.120
Jiang, I know

37:21.120 --> 37:22.400
You care about me.

37:25.760 --> 37:26.840
but

37:28.160 --> 37:30.280
I need a lot of money now

37:30.280 --> 37:31.520
The more the better.

37:31.520 --> 37:33.840
Okay, I'll make money with you.

37:34.080 --> 37:37.080

37:37.480 --> 37:38.320
This time is no exception.

37:38.640 --> 37:41.400
I bought a one-way ticket.

37:42.640 --> 37:44.640
Either you go back with me

37:45.040 --> 37:46.760
Or I can stay here with you.

37:47.200 --> 37:48.920
I won't leave without you.

37:48.960 --> 37:50.160
Won't you take me away?

37:51.840 --> 37:52.840
Are you kidding me?

37:52.840 --> 37:54.840
Can your company give
you such a long vacation?

37:57.440 --> 37:58.440
Excellent,

37:59.440 --> 38:00.280
I resigned.

38:01.480 --> 38:02.480
again?

38:04.040 --> 38:05.040
OMG.

38:06.920 --> 38:08.080
Our family’s real estate income

38:08.640 --> 38:10.640
Just renting money allows me
to make money easily and effortlessly.

38:10.640 --> 38:13.040
Why endure the humiliation for a salary?

38:13.800 --> 38:14.800
Only a few thousand?

38:14.800 --> 38:15.800
I don't want that,

38:16.160 --> 38:17.160
So I quit.

38:27.240 --> 38:28.440
In two days?

38:28.880 --> 38:29.600
That won't work.

38:30.040 --> 38:31.280
If I don't get it today,
I'm dead.

38:33.800 --> 38:35.080
So what happened to Wei An?

38:35.080 --> 38:37.080
Is there enough Maotai for the general?

38:37.640 --> 38:39.760
You only got so many bottles for your hard work tonight.

38:40.640 --> 38:42.400
Have you asked the airport duty-free shop?

38:42.720 --> 38:44.040
We can have people come in and buy it.

38:44.280 --> 38:45.560
It's not that easy.

38:46.040 --> 38:48.040
He is an expert on China.

38:48.040 --> 38:50.640
All goods in duty-free shops
are exported.

38:50.640 --> 38:52.040

38:54.040 --> 38:55.040
what can we do?

38:55.840 --> 38:56.840
Here we are.

39:03.000 --> 39:03.640

39:03.880 --> 39:05.320

Why don't you buy a ticket
and go back?

39:16.200 --> 39:17.040
I don't want you to get involved.

39:17.040 --> 39:18.800
The general's people are terrible.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.400
I just got here. I will not leave.

39:22.520 --> 39:24.040
Go away. get lost!

39:24.040 --> 39:25.040
What's wrong?

39:26.720 --> 39:27.720
hurry!

39:29.680 --> 39:30.440
No.

39:30.440 --> 39:31.000
What's wrong?

39:32.080 --> 39:34.880
Go away!

39:34.880 --> 39:35.760
Go there now!

39:35.760 --> 39:36.680
who are they?

39:36.680 --> 39:37.480
General's people.

39:37.880 --> 39:40.520
Go there now!

39:40.520 --> 39:41.600
There is a box here.

39:41.600 --> 39:42.600
A lot of people!

39:45.560 --> 39:46.640
There is only one carton.

39:47.880 --> 39:49.960
you! Carry this cardboard box into the car.

39:51.040 --> 39:52.680
Get that woman.

39:53.960 --> 39:55.040
Hide yourself.

39:56.040 --> 39:57.040
Break the door open!

40:11.480 --> 40:12.440
No!

40:12.760 --> 40:14.120
All my money is in it.

40:14.200 --> 40:15.240
Is your money more important than your life?

40:20.880 --> 40:21.920
where are you going?

40:22.800 --> 40:24.200
My snacks and hot sauce!

40:24.720 --> 40:26.520
seriously? chili sauce?

40:26.520 --> 40:28.480
Your mother asked me to bring it to you.

40:53.520 --> 40:54.520
you,

40:58.360 --> 40:59.160
Stand there.

40:59.160 --> 40:59.800
Yes.

40:59.800 --> 41:01.280
Notify all locations

41:01.400 --> 41:02.960
If Su Weian is found,
report it to the general immediately.

41:03.440 --> 41:04.160
move!

41:04.640 --> 41:05.360
let's go.

41:12.040 --> 41:14.040
my money! My shop!

41:14.240 --> 41:15.280
This is too terrible!

41:21.960 --> 41:22.680
River,

41:22.920 --> 41:24.400
We can't go back today.

41:26.040 --> 41:27.720
The general's people just said

41:27.880 --> 41:29.600
Said I ruined his party today

41:30.040 --> 41:31.880
They will catch me.

41:34.920 --> 41:36.000
why his people

41:36.840 --> 41:38.440
Acting like a gangster?

41:40.040 --> 41:42.040
We can only pay him back.

41:42.040 --> 41:44.160
How could they smash and rob your home?

41:44.320 --> 41:45.200
I'll call the police.

41:46.520 --> 41:47.880
What can the police do?

41:48.000 --> 41:49.920
He is like an emperor here

41:50.240 --> 41:51.240
Don't be afraid of anyone.

41:54.280 --> 41:55.720
where are we going

41:56.200 --> 41:57.320
Staying the night tonight?

41:58.480 --> 42:00.240
We can only find a hotel.

42:00.440 --> 42:02.040
The general has ordered

42:02.040 --> 42:04.400
There was no facility to accommodate me.

42:04.400 --> 42:06.160
They grab me as soon as they see me.

42:08.600 --> 42:09.840
Where can we go?

42:10.200 --> 42:12.040
Hello!

42:12.040 --> 42:14.040
Are you here
to apply for a job as an interpreter?

42:14.560 --> 42:16.040
I know a safe place to go.

42:16.760 --> 42:18.440
you do? This is your first day here.

42:18.440 --> 42:19.040
let's go.

42:20.680 --> 42:21.520
Come with me.

42:21.520 --> 42:22.140
【Friendship Hospital】

42:24.720 --> 42:26.040
what are you waiting for? let's go.

42:26.160 --> 42:28.720
I'd better go back
and apologize to the general.

42:29.680 --> 42:31.240
He won't really kill me.

42:31.640 --> 42:32.640
No.

42:33.520 --> 42:34.480
You are not even afraid of the general.

42:34.480 --> 42:35.480
Are you afraid of coming to the hospital?

42:36.760 --> 42:39.040
Your store is destroyed
and your business is gone.

42:39.040 --> 42:41.280
This is your safest and best place.

42:41.440 --> 42:43.640
Aren't you just here to make money?

42:43.640 --> 42:45.040
They pay you every week

42:45.040 --> 42:46.040
And the pay is good.

42:46.440 --> 42:48.040
what might be better for you

42:48.040 --> 42:48.840
Than this French translator works?

42:49.160 --> 42:50.040
never.
