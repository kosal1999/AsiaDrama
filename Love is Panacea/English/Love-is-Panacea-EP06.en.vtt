29:22.900 --> 29:24.140
I will return to Paris next month.

29:25.620 --> 29:27.690
Do you want to go to
Henri Mondor's laboratory?

29:28.570 --> 29:30.340
Can you take me to see Dr. Marta?

29:31.380 --> 29:32.420
Not just a visit.

29:33.300 --> 29:34.740
I'm asking you,

29:35.020 --> 29:36.860
Would you like
to work in Henri Mondor's laboratory?

29:37.060 --> 29:38.100
Oh, really?

29:38.100 --> 29:39.340
You will be able to work with Dr. Marta.

29:39.820 --> 29:41.180
Will you go to Paris with me?

29:41.220 --> 29:43.220
Can I participate in
Huntington's disease research?

29:47.780 --> 29:48.980
but I...

29:49.820 --> 29:52.060
I only have a bachelor's degree from China Medical University.

29:52.740 --> 29:53.740
Is this acceptable?

29:53.940 --> 29:54.940
I checked it out specifically.

29:55.500 --> 29:57.780
In France, degrees from Huaren Medical University are recognized.

29:57.860 --> 29:58.980
In Dr. Marta's laboratory,

29:59.300 --> 30:01.020
There are
research assistants with a bachelor's degree.

30:02.620 --> 30:03.300
¡ Amiable!

30:03.780 --> 30:04.380
great!

30:04.580 --> 30:05.820
But you have to be prepared.

30:06.860 --> 30:08.780
Huntington's disease is very rare.

30:09.260 --> 30:11.380
Research on new drugs
will be a long-term endeavor.

30:11.700 --> 30:12.620
who knows,

30:14.340 --> 30:15.940
You may have to
stay in Paris for many years.

30:20.940 --> 30:21.820
no problem.

30:23.700 --> 30:25.100
I would do anything if Huntington's disease could be cured .

30:35.460 --> 30:36.020
Su Wei'an.

30:42.740 --> 30:43.180
come over.

30:49.540 --> 30:52.060
You leave during work hours.

30:52.540 --> 30:53.740
I told you

30:53.740 --> 30:55.500
What are the consequences of leaving your position, remember?

30:55.860 --> 30:57.260
I have to rest today.

30:58.180 --> 30:58.980
It was Jiang's turn to go to work.

30:59.740 --> 31:01.420
Besides, Jiang can handle it himself now.

31:02.740 --> 31:04.020
Yes, she did a great job.

31:05.300 --> 31:07.460
Intracranial aneurysm removal

31:07.460 --> 31:08.980
as an intracranial tumor

31:09.500 --> 31:12.740
and
cerebral arterial malformations such as cerebral arterial adhesion,

31:13.500 --> 31:14.700
Other translations are acceptable.

31:15.180 --> 31:16.420
At least in comparison

31:16.420 --> 31:18.260
And those who fall in love during working hours,

31:18.260 --> 31:19.780
She is more responsible.

31:20.540 --> 31:21.980
Who are you implying?

31:22.660 --> 31:24.660
Who takes up work time to fall in love?

31:25.660 --> 31:26.540
Su Wei'an.

31:26.980 --> 31:27.980
french man

31:28.300 --> 31:30.100
They have always been known for their pursuit of romance and novelty.

31:30.740 --> 31:32.420
They can speak sweet words effortlessly.

31:32.580 --> 31:33.740
You shouldn't take it seriously.

31:33.860 --> 31:35.420
I just want to remember you.

31:36.260 --> 31:38.260
Don't be anxious about love,

31:38.580 --> 31:41.140
Lest your dreams
be shattered and your work affected.

31:43.820 --> 31:44.980
Professor Gu, don't worry.

31:45.860 --> 31:47.260
As a temporary translator,

31:47.740 --> 31:49.180
I won't cause any problems

31:49.180 --> 31:50.500
to the medical team.

31:52.780 --> 31:53.860
That was not what I meant.

31:54.420 --> 31:55.340
That's what I mean.

31:58.740 --> 32:00.580
And, in the future, this situation
will never happen again.

32:04.140 --> 32:04.980
I'm resigning.

32:06.140 --> 32:07.140
give up?

32:09.100 --> 32:10.260
Espera, Su Wei'an.

32:10.940 --> 32:12.460
I'm just reminding you.

32:12.460 --> 32:14.340
You don't need to get angry
and quit.

32:14.700 --> 32:15.700
I'm not angry.

32:16.300 --> 32:18.740
This is a carefully considered decision.

32:23.740 --> 32:24.860
Was it because of that kiss?

32:28.660 --> 32:29.180
Yo...

32:31.580 --> 32:32.860
There's no need to take it so seriously.

32:33.060 --> 32:33.740
that kiss

32:35.300 --> 32:37.620
This is just a local New Year custom.

32:38.580 --> 32:39.660
you are close

32:39.980 --> 32:41.980
At that time, so I...

32:43.660 --> 32:44.980
You...shouldn't take it seriously.

32:53.060 --> 32:53.980
Professor Gu,
there is no need to remind me about this.

32:54.340 --> 32:55.300
It's just a kiss.

33:00.260 --> 33:01.300
Of course I don't take it seriously.

33:04.100 --> 33:05.340
so,

33:05.980 --> 33:07.260
Why did you resign?

33:13.980 --> 33:14.700
for money.

33:16.980 --> 33:18.740
I found a more lucrative job.

33:22.460 --> 33:23.740
I'm leaving here and going to Paris.

33:25.980 --> 33:26.740
So please,

33:29.060 --> 33:30.420
Don't get in my way of
making money.

Are you going to France?

34:03.700 --> 34:05.060
So suddenly?

34:05.380 --> 34:06.580
Suddenly I received a big order.

34:06.700 --> 34:07.660
I have to go there.

34:07.900 --> 34:08.620
I'm going to Paris.

34:09.620 --> 34:10.220
All right.

34:10.220 --> 34:11.980
Wherever you go, take me with you.

34:11.980 --> 34:12.740
OK?

34:14.980 --> 34:15.660
Jiang.

34:16.660 --> 34:18.180
If you follow me, you'll just be at a loss

34:19.020 --> 34:20.140
And you don't need money.

34:21.060 --> 34:22.860
listen to me. Go home quickly.

34:23.020 --> 34:23.500
No.

34:23.900 --> 34:25.660
I came all the way here just to find you.

34:25.660 --> 34:27.340
You can't leave me alone anymore.

34:27.780 --> 34:28.700
never.

34:30.780 --> 34:32.740
Plus, I've never been to Paris.

34:32.740 --> 34:33.980
Take me with you.

34:38.660 --> 34:40.980
Are you really going to leave me alone
and go away?

34:42.060 --> 34:43.380
listen. impossible.

34:43.940 --> 34:45.780
Three years ago, I didn't see it coming.

34:45.940 --> 34:46.700
But this time,

34:46.700 --> 34:47.660
I won't let you go alone.

34:47.820 --> 34:49.500
Otherwise, please let me know.

34:49.780 --> 34:51.980
Because you're leaving? where are you going?
How long will you stay there?

34:52.260 --> 34:52.860
and,

34:53.700 --> 34:54.980
Why did you
suddenly give up your studies?

34:55.340 --> 34:57.100
Why did you give up
your dream of becoming a doctor?

34:57.700 --> 34:59.700
You have to explain all this to me clearly.

35:07.980 --> 35:08.740
Yo...

35:11.700 --> 35:12.980
I'm going to run away with Elliot

35:13.140 --> 35:14.260
Escape?

35:15.300 --> 35:15.980
precise.

35:16.980 --> 35:18.340
So, Jiang, you can't follow me.

35:18.580 --> 35:20.060
Are you going to elope with Elliot?

35:20.340 --> 35:21.180
Su Wei'an.

35:21.180 --> 35:22.340
I know you like Gu Yunzheng.

35:22.340 --> 35:23.260
You can hide it from others,

35:23.260 --> 35:24.300
But not me.

35:25.260 --> 35:28.060
You
've liked him since you were in college, right?

35:28.060 --> 35:30.060
And, you two
kissed at that New Year's party.

35:30.660 --> 35:31.740
now you tell me

35:32.060 --> 35:32.700
you want to run away

35:32.700 --> 35:34.980
With a
French man you barely know?

35:36.020 --> 35:36.700
Su Wei'an.

35:37.100 --> 35:38.180
I'm actually not stupid.

35:39.660 --> 35:40.540
Jiang.

35:41.340 --> 35:42.660
El besoque le di a Gu Yunzheng

35:43.380 --> 35:45.100
It's just a New Year gesture

35:45.540 --> 35:46.900
Doesn't have any special meaning.

35:47.460 --> 35:49.100
It was love at first sight with Eliot.

35:49.540 --> 35:50.780
He is the love of my life.

35:51.660 --> 35:52.740
I'm going to France with him.

35:54.140 --> 35:55.300
and know,

35:55.570 --> 35:58.260
Love has no logic

35:59.180 --> 36:01.060
It also doesn't obey orders.

36:05.660 --> 36:06.540
What are you doing?

36:10.460 --> 36:11.020
arts.

36:11.900 --> 36:13.340
Explain this.

36:16.060 --> 36:17.700
Why do you study euthanasia?

36:20.340 --> 36:22.180
Someone asked me for help before;

36:22.180 --> 36:24.020
Promises very high commissions.

36:25.620 --> 36:26.340
The commission is very high.

36:26.340 --> 36:28.180
So I saved
the files but didn't throw them away.

36:34.660 --> 36:36.260
Do you think I want to die?

36:37.180 --> 36:38.660
I'm still alive and well.

36:38.980 --> 36:39.820
Su Wei'an.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.340
Did you tell the truth?

36:43.340 --> 36:45.100
Do you really consider me your friend?

36:45.420 --> 36:46.260
you are my best friend.

36:52.980 --> 36:53.780
Wei'an.

36:54.380 --> 36:55.980
no matter what happens,

36:56.860 --> 36:58.140
If you have something painful tormenting you,

36:58.140 --> 36:59.740
you can tell me.

36:59.980 --> 37:02.860
I know there are some things
you can't tell your mother.

37:03.420 --> 37:04.700
But you can tell me.

37:04.700 --> 37:06.100
I will definitely keep it a secret.

37:06.100 --> 37:06.660
Oh, really.

37:06.980 --> 37:07.700
Mira.

37:07.980 --> 37:08.980
I have been coming to Lakaya for a long time.

37:08.980 --> 37:10.740
I haven't revealed anything about you to Mi-ran.

37:10.740 --> 37:11.940
I'm very reliable.

37:13.380 --> 37:15.260
And we are like family,

37:15.260 --> 37:16.380
best friend.

37:16.460 --> 37:17.980
I can help you share a lot.

37:24.740 --> 37:26.060
Pero, Jiang, yo...

37:26.060 --> 37:27.620
I did not lie to you.

37:27.900 --> 37:30.380
I'm really going to run away with Elliot

37:31.260 --> 37:32.540
real.

37:33.500 --> 37:34.380
And you

37:34.860 --> 37:36.660
You want me
to find love too, right?

37:36.860 --> 37:38.020
That amulet in my bag

37:38.180 --> 37:39.300
You put it in, right?

37:40.900 --> 37:42.340
Trust me, Chiang.

37:44.100 --> 37:45.540
You are so stubborn.

37:45.540 --> 37:47.740
You went to France without
telling me the truth, did you?

37:49.020 --> 37:49.500
Bueno.

37:49.940 --> 37:51.860
If you leave, our friendship is over.

37:52.180 --> 37:53.580
I don't need a friend like you.

37:54.620 --> 37:55.460
Jiang.

38:14.860 --> 38:15.860
I'm resigning.

38:17.460 --> 38:18.460
give up?

38:21.900 --> 38:23.100
Was it because of that kiss?

38:23.700 --> 38:24.980
There's no need to take it so seriously.

38:25.180 --> 38:25.820
that kiss

38:25.940 --> 38:28.300
This is just a local New Year custom.

38:34.340 --> 38:37.860
You were nearby at the time,
so I...

38:40.340 --> 38:41.340
You...shouldn't take it seriously.

38:42.900 --> 38:44.260
Professor Gu,
there is no need to remind me about this.

38:44.340 --> 38:45.540
It's just a kiss.

38:46.340 --> 38:47.340
French kiss

38:48.340 --> 38:50.340
This is as normal as eating or drinking.

38:51.940 --> 38:53.060
Of course I don't take it seriously.

39:11.420 --> 39:12.220
(Gu Yunzheng.)

39:12.740 --> 39:13.900
(You
are a wonderful person in every way.)

39:13.900 --> 39:15.620
(Why do you only have that stupid mouth?)

40:02.540 --> 40:04.500
No, it's too forced.

40:10.100 --> 40:11.100
Su Wei'an.

40:12.340 --> 40:14.540
This is the glutinous rice balls from the canteen.

40:14.900 --> 40:15.900
Very sweet and sticky.

40:16.340 --> 40:17.500
I bought it for you.

40:18.740 --> 40:19.540
Al,

40:20.540 --> 40:21.700
I did not mean that.

40:22.820 --> 40:23.820
actually, I...

40:26.340 --> 40:26.940
No,

40:27.820 --> 40:28.860
I said too much.

40:33.340 --> 40:34.220

40:41.540 --> 40:42.740
At Huaren Hospital in China,

40:42.740 --> 40:44.340
He is the youngest associate doctor.

40:44.780 --> 40:46.020
Although he looks a little reserved

40:46.020 --> 40:47.100
and distant,

40:47.420 --> 40:48.780
Very responsible

40:48.780 --> 40:50.100
with every patient.

40:51.180 --> 40:52.100
So, don't worry.

40:52.220 --> 40:54.220
This operation will definitely be successful.

40:58.660 --> 40:59.860
Genial, Su Wei'an.

41:01.340 --> 41:02.740
You are so aggressive in front of me.

41:03.340 --> 41:04.980
But behind my back,
you praised me.

41:05.860 --> 41:07.180
You are hypocritical.

41:16.140 --> 41:17.100

41:24.020 --> 41:25.740
Although this is a temporary job,

41:25.820 --> 41:27.260
I think it should be formal.

41:31.020 --> 41:32.420
I appreciate your time helping me.

41:33.820 --> 41:35.500
I hope you find it soon

41:54.460 --> 41:56.700
You want to make money,

41:57.500 --> 41:59.100
There is no need to go to France.

41:59.860 --> 42:01.100
I can give you a raise.

42:02.860 --> 42:03.420
It's not necessary

42:04.220 --> 42:05.340
It's not just about money.

42:06.740 --> 42:07.780
so give it to me

42:07.780 --> 42:09.340
a reason that satisfies me

42:09.900 --> 42:11.340
Reasons why you should give up on something again

42:11.340 --> 42:12.780
Half.

42:19.460 --> 42:21.060
You said it's not about money.

42:22.330 --> 42:23.700
Are you doing this for Elliot?

42:26.220 --> 42:28.090
Do you really like Eliot?

42:30.130 --> 42:31.130
Is it for him?

42:36.500 --> 42:38.060
If there's nothing more to say,
I'll leave first.

42:38.340 --> 42:40.140
I need to go to the embassy
to apply for an emergency visa.

42:42.140 --> 42:43.700
According to our contract,

42:44.460 --> 42:46.660
Resignation must
be submitted one week in advance.

42:47.220 --> 42:50.340
The resignation will be effective one week after submission.

42:51.100 --> 42:52.140
During this time,

42:53.900 --> 42:54.940
You have to keep working.

42:55.420 --> 42:56.100
if you are missing,

42:57.140 --> 42:58.020
They will deduct your wages.
