[Episode 5]

01:25.980 --> 01:26.760
[The play is a major
literary and artistic support project]

01:26.760 --> 01:27.980
[In Sichuan Province in 2022]

01:27.980 --> 01:29.980
[Adapted
from the Ningmeng language novel "The Healer"]

01:55.420 --> 01:56.740
Come on, something's happening.

01:59.020 --> 02:00.660
General Kouyate is here!

02:00.660 --> 02:01.980
He had a team of heavily armed soldiers.

02:06.540 --> 02:08.860
What's the point?
Just two cases of wine?

02:56.540 --> 02:57.500
Let's go talk to the general.

02:58.820 --> 02:59.540
Average!

02:59.780 --> 03:01.860
I lost alcohol. I'll pay for it.

03:02.420 --> 03:03.420
Please don't
cause trouble in the hospital.

03:03.740 --> 03:05.300
What are you doing?

03:05.420 --> 03:07.420
I will take responsibility for my mistakes
.

03:08.460 --> 03:09.420
little girl,

03:09.980 --> 03:11.500
You chose a good place

03:11.500 --> 03:12.740
hide.

03:15.420 --> 03:16.420
Average.

03:17.420 --> 03:18.180
Can you speak Chinese?

03:18.420 --> 03:21.420
The general studied at Shijiazhuang Military Academy.

03:21.900 --> 03:22.900
He even knows the local dialect.

03:24.260 --> 03:25.020
You bad girl!

03:25.060 --> 03:27.540
Do you know the consequences of selling me fake wine?

03:27.620 --> 03:28.620
Fake wine?

03:29.420 --> 03:30.020
This is impossible.

03:30.020 --> 03:31.100
I never sell fake wine.

03:32.180 --> 03:34.620
Maybe you replaced the alcohol yourself

03:34.660 --> 03:36.660
and knowingly claimed it was false.

03:36.860 --> 03:38.820
As a respected general,

03:39.900 --> 03:41.780
Do I need to frame you?

03:43.140 --> 03:44.140
You arrogant girl,

03:44.900 --> 03:46.420
Let's settle the score later.

03:47.780 --> 03:49.540
I'm not here for you

03:50.220 --> 03:51.100
But for him.

03:52.180 --> 03:53.140
Wait, General,

03:53.420 --> 03:54.860
You have completed the inspection.

03:55.420 --> 03:56.820
No tumors or bleeding points.

03:56.820 --> 03:58.420
How to prove that you are sick?

03:59.420 --> 04:00.900
My instincts are never wrong.

04:01.180 --> 04:02.420
It's up to him to prove it.

04:03.140 --> 04:04.140
Generally,

04:05.140 --> 04:07.420
Why are you so sure
you are sick?

04:11.220 --> 04:11.980
in the past,

04:13.540 --> 04:15.020
stand right here,

04:15.500 --> 04:16.500
I could shoot you in the head

04:17.140 --> 04:19.260
When you are standing downstairs.

04:19.700 --> 04:20.740
But now I can't.

04:21.020 --> 04:22.860
This may be due to a decrease in your vision

04:22.860 --> 04:24.140
Or just because you're getting older.

04:25.820 --> 04:28.020
In any case, you should
consult your primary care physician.

04:31.780 --> 04:34.180
[Elliot]

04:34.540 --> 04:35.540
Elliot?

04:38.420 --> 04:39.420
I'm not afraid of death.

04:40.260 --> 04:41.260
What I'm afraid of is death

04:41.260 --> 04:43.420
I don’t know who my enemy is.

04:44.220 --> 04:45.340
Elliot had no guts.

04:45.980 --> 04:46.700
And you?

04:52.660 --> 04:53.460
if you don't help me

04:53.460 --> 04:55.060
Figure out what's wrong with my brain

04:55.420 --> 04:56.460
I will kill her.

04:58.420 --> 05:00.900
Selling counterfeit alcohol in Lakaya
is a serious crime

05:01.820 --> 05:02.860
now i doubt

05:02.860 --> 05:04.740
It was her fake wine
that caused my headache.

05:04.820 --> 05:06.020
I'm not selling fake wine.

05:09.420 --> 05:10.420
Put your gun down.

05:10.740 --> 05:12.020
I can perform surgery on you

05:12.180 --> 05:13.740
but can you believe me

05:13.820 --> 05:16.020
with your life?

05:25.420 --> 05:27.340
I'm not afraid of bullets.

05:28.140 --> 05:29.740
Not to mention the scalpel.

05:30.820 --> 05:31.500
certainly,

05:33.460 --> 05:34.420
if you dare

05:34.860 --> 05:36.180
take any action,

05:36.180 --> 05:38.340
Don't expect
to leave the operating table alive.

05:44.780 --> 05:45.420
beautiful.

05:46.860 --> 05:48.860
I will perform surgery on you in a month.

05:50.580 --> 05:51.580
I can

05:52.780 --> 05:54.420
You will definitely find your enemy.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.740
OK I've found the right person.

06:01.300 --> 06:02.420
You are a good doctor.

06:08.180 --> 06:08.780
Are you okay?

06:08.940 --> 06:09.420
Yes, I am fine.

06:12.420 --> 06:13.460
Why do you agree with him?

06:14.260 --> 06:15.860
The hospital has examined him.

06:16.140 --> 06:17.940
And it is clearly written on the medical record

06:18.260 --> 06:19.420
There's nothing wrong with him.

06:24.980 --> 06:26.180
or

06:26.740 --> 06:27.700
do you agree with him

06:27.700 --> 06:29.220
Just to dispel his suspicions?

06:31.900 --> 06:33.740
Not because of the general's threats

06:33.740 --> 06:34.860
if you don't

06:35.220 --> 06:36.860
He's going to kill me, right?

06:40.860 --> 06:42.500
You can't be that stupid, can you?

06:43.260 --> 06:45.140
I can buy a ticket to leave the country
or go to another country,

06:45.140 --> 06:46.340
Then there was nothing he could do to me.

06:50.860 --> 06:51.860
PhD. Gu.

06:52.180 --> 06:53.260
what will you do

06:53.260 --> 06:54.420
If after surgery,

06:54.460 --> 06:55.420
Still can't find anything?

06:57.900 --> 06:59.220
will be considered

06:59.420 --> 07:01.420
major medical accident,

07:03.420 --> 07:05.420
You might not even be
a doctor anymore.

07:09.820 --> 07:11.060
You can't take such a risk.

07:18.420 --> 07:19.420
Su Wei'an.

07:21.700 --> 07:22.700
Are you really worried about me?

07:26.420 --> 07:27.420
Absolutely not.

07:29.340 --> 07:30.140
I...

07:31.140 --> 07:32.420
I'm just worried about
getting into trouble.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.740
If the operation fails

07:35.700 --> 07:36.940
As a translator I would not be able to escape.

07:43.740 --> 07:44.460
wait. Why are you

07:44.460 --> 07:45.820
Is this surgery necessary?

07:48.140 --> 07:49.220
Because if I don't someone will die.

07:51.860 --> 07:54.420
Do you know
what happened to the general?

07:57.660 --> 07:58.540
I mean,

07:58.540 --> 08:00.700
If I don't do this I will die.

08:02.420 --> 08:02.980
Do you think

08:03.420 --> 08:05.060
we could have
left this room

08:05.060 --> 08:06.420
if i don't agree

08:06.420 --> 08:08.580
Operate on him?

08:12.420 --> 08:13.220
either way.

08:13.860 --> 08:15.420
Why don't you buy a
ticket back to China?

08:15.740 --> 08:16.780
I'll help you delay.

08:17.660 --> 08:19.580
The general cannot return to China.

08:24.140 --> 08:24.820
Su Wei'an.

08:25.820 --> 08:27.100
you do not trust me?

08:31.140 --> 08:32.140
I believe in science.

08:33.420 --> 08:34.300
CT scan

08:34.300 --> 08:35.180
and MRI

08:35.180 --> 08:36.420
Both parties confirmed
there were no issues.

08:40.900 --> 08:42.900
General Kouyate is not sick!

08:45.060 --> 08:45.860
Who are you...

08:47.420 --> 08:48.220
Elliot.

08:48.620 --> 08:50.300
General Kouyate's physician.

08:50.540 --> 08:51.420
Elliot.

08:52.500 --> 08:53.420
Do you know Chinese?

08:53.540 --> 08:55.220
My grandmother is from Beijing.

08:55.700 --> 08:57.060
I learned some from her.

08:58.260 --> 08:59.420
I've heard about you.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.900
Dr. Gu Yunzheng from Huaren Hospital.

09:02.420 --> 09:04.420
Don't you want zero table mortality records?

09:05.900 --> 09:07.900
There is zero mortality at the table.

09:09.060 --> 09:10.460
What a proud record!

09:12.260 --> 09:13.900
It shows that Dr. Gu is still too young.

09:14.260 --> 09:15.460
And too few surgeries are performed.

09:16.420 --> 09:19.020
Newcomers are always eager
to prove themselves.

09:19.140 --> 09:21.140
I can understand that, Dr. Gu.

09:21.740 --> 09:22.740
But remember,
patients are more than just tools

09:23.420 --> 09:25.420
Earn fame and wealth for doctors.

09:25.700 --> 09:26.700
You are talking nonsense!

09:27.820 --> 09:28.820
In China, Dr. Gu’s

09:28.820 --> 09:30.420
Weekly
outpatient visits and surgeries

09:30.980 --> 09:32.860
Dozens of times more than your French doctors.

09:33.420 --> 09:34.700
From clinical experience,

09:35.020 --> 09:36.260
You are not necessarily better than him.

09:36.660 --> 09:37.420
is that so?

09:38.220 --> 09:40.460
How do patients like you understand
the clinical experience?

09:45.420 --> 09:47.900
General Kouyate
has been a patient of mine.

09:48.180 --> 09:50.420
The diagnosis result is
the result of remote consultation

09:50.420 --> 09:52.060
Work with a team of French experts.

09:52.420 --> 09:53.060
Excuse me,

09:53.060 --> 09:55.820
Without the diagnosis of a mass,

09:56.060 --> 09:58.180
Why did Dr. Gu insist
on doing this surgery?

09:58.180 --> 09:58.900
Does it constitute provocation?

09:58.900 --> 10:00.740
Against the French National Hospital?

10:00.860 --> 10:01.860
Dr. Elliot.

10:03.060 --> 10:04.060
your hospital

10:04.860 --> 10:06.420
It's not that important to me.

10:07.340 --> 10:08.980
I just want to provide

10:08.980 --> 10:10.420
The best treatment for this patient.

10:11.420 --> 10:12.140
Now,

10:13.220 --> 10:15.180
I am the patient's primary care physician.

10:27.010 --> 10:29.420
If you insist on having surgery

10:31.420 --> 10:34.220
I will invite
experts from the Lakaya Health Commission

10:34.300 --> 10:35.300
to oversee the entire process.

10:35.300 --> 10:36.780
Doctor Gu, I warn you:

10:36.860 --> 10:37.900
If confirmed after surgery

10:37.900 --> 10:39.820
Say you had fake surgery

10:40.420 --> 10:41.660
i will sue you

10:41.660 --> 10:43.420
Until you never get a chance
to pick up the scalpel.

10:49.140 --> 10:50.580
Miss Radical.

10:50.860 --> 10:52.420
I hope you won't regret it.

11:02.900 --> 11:03.940
Damn poker face.

11:04.420 --> 11:06.100
He has a high nose and is arrogant.

11:12.420 --> 11:13.620
Look no further.

11:13.620 --> 11:14.420
he's gone.

11:15.060 --> 11:16.060
He is so handsome.

11:16.940 --> 11:18.780
As handsome as a Roman statue.

11:21.220 --> 11:22.220
What's the use of being handsome?

11:22.780 --> 11:24.420
The patient has switched to our boss.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.220
do you know him?

11:30.260 --> 11:32.180
He was General Kouyate's
physician.

11:32.420 --> 11:33.420
I asked around.

11:34.140 --> 11:36.900
He is the director of neurosurgery at the French National Hospital

11:37.740 --> 11:40.060
He is also
Professor of Neurosurgery at the University of Paris VI.

11:40.980 --> 11:44.060
He can be considered
an authority in the field of neurosurgery.

11:45.140 --> 11:46.140
authority?

11:48.780 --> 11:50.980
So, who is better, him or Dr. Gu?

11:53.060 --> 11:54.460
Well, it's hard to say.

11:56.340 --> 11:57.340
University of Paris VI

11:57.420 --> 12:00.420
It is the largest scientific and medical institution in France

12:01.220 --> 12:03.820
It is also one of the top five research universities in the world.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.460
Since this authority says that
General Kouyat was not ill.

12:08.660 --> 12:10.340
Why did he insist on
finding the problem?

12:13.420 --> 12:15.420
I also hope that the boss can find
a reason to refuse.

12:16.100 --> 12:17.420
These people are heavily armed and very dangerous.

12:18.420 --> 12:19.460
They are not to be underestimated.

12:19.460 --> 12:20.900
What happens if treatment fails?

12:21.420 --> 12:22.420
Bullets don't discriminate.

12:24.180 --> 12:25.180
So what should we do?

12:25.580 --> 12:27.380
Has Dr. Gu changed his mind?

12:30.840 --> 12:33.160
[doctor's office]

12:35.100 --> 12:35.900
What are you doing?

12:37.580 --> 12:39.260
If my objections are overturned, please join the fight.

guard

12:42.260 --> 12:44.100
Our boss has zero mortality on the operating table.

12:45.740 --> 12:47.900
Zero mortality on the operating table?

12:49.500 --> 12:50.660
Is this a competition?

12:51.340 --> 12:52.340
touching?

12:54.140 --> 12:56.700
Maybe it’s competition with myself.

12:57.420 --> 12:58.500
which doctor

12:58.500 --> 13:00.780
Don’t want
zero mortality on the operating table?

13:01.180 --> 13:02.180
And you?

13:04.180 --> 13:04.980
I?

13:06.220 --> 13:07.100
I have no records.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.420
Help me find it.

13:10.020 --> 13:10.780
I don't have much time.

13:10.780 --> 13:12.260
I must read
them all tonight.

13:14.420 --> 13:15.420
This is...

13:16.820 --> 13:17.700
Very.

13:17.780 --> 13:20.140
How long will it take both of us to finish?

13:20.420 --> 13:21.460
Maybe an all-nighter

13:22.740 --> 13:24.660
It was enough for the two of us.

13:24.740 --> 13:25.740
Pulling an all-nighter?

13:26.300 --> 13:26.980
never!

13:27.420 --> 13:28.740
Staying up late gives me acne.

13:30.220 --> 13:31.420
beautiful.

13:38.420 --> 13:39.420
Let's just do it.

13:42.780 --> 13:43.620
tell me.

13:44.100 --> 13:45.100
What should I do?

Why did you agree
to operate on the patient ?

15:18.580 --> 15:20.420
Without knowing the disease?

30:29.300 --> 30:30.780
breakfast.

30:31.300 --> 30:33.620
Are you still in the mood for breakfast?

30:34.780 --> 30:36.620
You drank a lot,

30:36.700 --> 30:38.300
Why can't I eat?

30:38.820 --> 30:39.420
I...

30:39.420 --> 30:42.620
I know you did it for me.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.760
You don't want
my reputation to be tarnished.

30:47.800 --> 30:48.760
But Su Wei'an,

30:49.720 --> 30:50.640
Let me ask you something.

30:51.280 --> 30:51.920
why do you think

30:52.600 --> 30:55.040
I gave it to General Kouyate

30:55.040 --> 30:56.360
Operation?

30:56.720 --> 30:57.640
how could I know?

30:59.200 --> 31:02.120
Is it because the general
pointed a gun at you ?

31:02.200 --> 31:04.720
Or because you want to compete

31:05.080 --> 31:05.880
With Eliot?

31:09.240 --> 31:09.920
Su Wei'an,

31:11.280 --> 31:12.600
I'm a doctor.

31:12.880 --> 31:15.600
I had one reason for surgery.

31:16.160 --> 31:18.480
The patient has indications for surgery

31:18.760 --> 31:20.600
and required surgery.

31:20.920 --> 31:22.240
Why can't you believe me?

31:22.360 --> 31:23.320
I trust you.

31:25.160 --> 31:27.360
But I've been through all the medical cases

31:27.360 --> 31:28.840
The image is not clear,

31:29.880 --> 31:31.600
None
resembled the general's situation.

31:32.160 --> 31:33.600
So, you gave up?

31:35.440 --> 31:37.440
Does Huaren Medical University
only teach you?

31:38.560 --> 31:39.800
How can you give up?

31:44.840 --> 31:45.760
What?

31:45.760 --> 31:46.720
She is indeed a silly girl.

31:47.400 --> 31:48.400
No wonder you are an undergraduate.

31:48.960 --> 31:50.240
I'm not an undergraduate.

31:51.360 --> 31:52.560
I have a bachelor's degree.

31:53.560 --> 31:54.600
Bachelor's degree?

31:57.280 --> 32:00.120
In college classes,

32:00.120 --> 32:01.680
Mr. Gu taught you something.

32:01.960 --> 32:03.720
But I guess you forgot all about it.

32:04.040 --> 32:05.160
I really do not know

32:05.160 --> 32:07.240
How did you get your bachelor's degree.

32:09.080 --> 32:10.080
everyone,

32:10.080 --> 32:11.160
today,

32:11.880 --> 32:14.280
We need to learn
the diagnostic thinking of brain tumors

32:14.560 --> 32:17.240
Combined with practice.

32:17.240 --> 32:18.480
very clear

32:18.480 --> 32:20.080
We can't see obvious lesions

32:20.280 --> 32:22.280
CT from patient.

32:22.560 --> 32:24.560
Then, let's check out the MRI.

32:24.560 --> 32:26.720
We can clearly see some lesions

32:26.720 --> 32:28.560
On the patient's brainstem, right?

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
gentlemen. Gu,

32:34.160 --> 32:37.360
If the lesion still cannot be seen on MRI,

32:37.360 --> 32:38.560
What should the doctor do?

32:39.200 --> 32:41.200
He should do clinical follow-up

32:41.600 --> 32:44.080
Judging the development of the disease based on experience
,

32:44.200 --> 32:46.160
and confirm the follow-up intervals.

32:46.400 --> 32:50.040
So what must doctors believe,

32:50.040 --> 32:51.560
Clinical experience
or precision instruments?

32:51.960 --> 32:53.280
When a doctor cures a disease,

32:54.560 --> 32:55.720
Guidance is his rule,

32:56.280 --> 32:57.480
Knowledge is his foundation,

32:58.400 --> 33:00.040
Experience is his tool.

33:01.160 --> 33:02.600
With rigorous examination results,

33:02.720 --> 33:03.560
Doctors can figure it out

33:04.160 --> 33:06.080
Detailed description of lesions quickly and accurately

33:06.880 --> 33:08.280
To avoid delays or misdiagnosis.

33:09.040 --> 33:10.880
So, I want you all to keep that in mind.

33:10.880 --> 33:12.400
only by using instruments

33:12.400 --> 33:14.040
and develop
their own clinical thinking

33:14.320 --> 33:16.200
Can you
truly be responsible for your patients?

33:17.480 --> 33:18.560
you remember me.

33:20.120 --> 33:23.200
So you keep asking questions in class

33:23.400 --> 33:25.120
Just so I can remember you?

33:25.160 --> 33:26.600
of course not.

33:29.280 --> 33:31.000
This is the question you asked,

33:31.000 --> 33:32.560
But you forgot the answer.

33:33.560 --> 33:35.480
Use instruments.

33:35.960 --> 33:36.560
but...

33:36.560 --> 33:38.440
Why are you sure you
can see the abnormality within a month?

33:40.080 --> 33:42.560
What is the patient's walking problem?

33:47.560 --> 33:49.040
He swaggers,

33:49.040 --> 33:50.200
swaying,

33:50.480 --> 33:51.560
And shuffle the cards.

33:51.560 --> 33:53.840
What disease do these symptoms indicate?

33:53.840 --> 33:54.720
He looks like a drunkard,

33:55.560 --> 33:56.560
Leg weakness,

33:57.280 --> 33:58.920
and cerebellar ataxia.

33:59.080 --> 34:00.560
Is there anything wrong with his speech?

34:02.560 --> 34:03.560
He has slurred speech

34:03.560 --> 34:04.560
and stammered.

34:05.680 --> 34:06.560
Dysarthria.

34:06.920 --> 34:08.080
What is he complaining about?

34:08.560 --> 34:09.560
While you're downstairs,

34:09.560 --> 34:11.560
I could shoot your head off.

34:12.230 --> 34:13.670
But now, I can't.

34:13.670 --> 34:14.560
His skills declined.

34:18.150 --> 34:20.440
Decreased flexibility of limbs.

34:20.920 --> 34:22.040
so?

34:23.400 --> 34:25.880
Therefore, the disease may be in...

34:29.710 --> 34:30.560
in his brainstem.

34:31.960 --> 34:32.760
not bad.

34:33.440 --> 34:34.960
You haven't completely forgotten it.

34:39.150 --> 34:41.560
Today's imaging technology
is very advanced.

34:42.960 --> 34:45.120
Why can’t we see the lesions?

34:45.230 --> 34:47.040
Maybe it's in a weird position.

34:47.280 --> 34:49.120
Or maybe it's the initial stages.

34:50.630 --> 34:51.670
But anyway,

34:52.150 --> 34:53.440
doctors like us

34:53.440 --> 34:55.230
Don’t ignore every tiny signal

34:55.560 --> 34:58.320
from the patient's body.

【Friendship Hospital】

35:01.700 --> 35:02.340
[One month later]
General,

35:02.620 --> 35:04.180
MRI shows some abnormalities

35:04.180 --> 35:05.060
In your brainstem.

35:05.620 --> 35:06.500
Next,

35:06.780 --> 35:07.760
Trust Dr. Gu.

35:08.340 --> 35:09.340
Please trust him.

35:09.550 --> 35:10.740
Knock it off?

35:16.140 --> 35:17.140
What are you doing here?

35:17.140 --> 35:19.320
On behalf of
the local health board,

35:20.720 --> 35:23.620
I will supervise the entire operation.

35:25.100 --> 35:26.380
MRI shows

35:26.380 --> 35:29.140
Some abnormalities in the brainstem.

35:30.100 --> 35:30.900
Next,

35:31.620 --> 35:33.900
Chinese doctors will demonstrate
their superb medical skills.

35:43.440 --> 35:44.200
they are.

35:44.560 --> 35:46.320
Gu Yunzheng is so young.

35:47.240 --> 35:48.520
How dare he do brain stem surgery?

35:49.560 --> 35:50.200
you are wrong.

35:51.160 --> 35:52.560
We should believe Dr. Gu.

35:57.100 --> 35:59.660
【Friendship Hospital】

36:00.240 --> 36:01.240
Average!

36:01.840 --> 36:02.840
What are you doing?

36:02.880 --> 36:04.560
I'll go in now.
Wherever the general is, I will be there.

36:04.680 --> 36:06.560
He said he would stay wherever the general was.

36:07.680 --> 36:08.560
Let him in.

36:11.040 --> 36:12.520
The doctor said we can go in.

36:12.520 --> 36:13.480
but you must obey

36:13.480 --> 36:14.200
Sterility rules.

36:14.200 --> 36:14.800
follow me.

36:17.560 --> 36:18.360
boss,

36:18.600 --> 36:19.680
Wherever you go, I will go.

36:19.920 --> 36:21.360
I will even die with you.

36:21.840 --> 36:24.000
No one dies unless your hands tremble.

36:24.920 --> 36:25.400
you...

36:25.600 --> 36:26.920
Die with you?

36:27.560 --> 36:29.320
Then my life would be tragic.

36:53.800 --> 36:54.800
It has been a long time.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.560
Can he succeed?

36:59.320 --> 37:00.320
I told you.

37:01.400 --> 37:03.120
He couldn't have brainstem surgery.

37:03.640 --> 37:04.600
PhD. Gu

37:05.000 --> 37:07.360
Persistence risked the general's life.

37:08.720 --> 37:11.000
before irreparable damage is caused,

37:11.120 --> 37:12.560
It's not too late to close his skull.

37:16.480 --> 37:17.800
The operation is not over yet.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.120
Don't jump to conclusions.

37:23.200 --> 37:25.320
Blood pressure is falling.

37:26.120 --> 37:27.240
Blood pressure is falling.

37:29.800 --> 37:30.560
PhD. Gu,

37:30.560 --> 37:32.080
Put down the scalpel immediately.

37:32.080 --> 37:32.960
Otherwise I will hold you accountable

37:32.960 --> 37:34.000
I represent the Board of Health.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.280
Leave it all to Dr. Elliot.

37:36.360 --> 37:38.280
Go away. Otherwise I will kill you.

37:44.320 --> 37:45.720
Get out now!

37:58.720 --> 38:00.960
You are not approaching Dr. Gu

38:00.960 --> 38:02.160
Unless I die.

38:06.880 --> 38:09.360
No one can stop Dr. Gu's surgery.

38:09.520 --> 38:11.920
No one is allowed to disturb the surgeon.

38:12.040 --> 38:12.920
Miss Su,

38:12.920 --> 38:14.080
You are just a translator.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.160
You are not qualified
to comment on surgery.

38:16.320 --> 38:18.440
It's not too late to stop it.

38:18.440 --> 38:20.080
I graduated with a major in clinical medicine

38:20.080 --> 38:21.280
from Huaren Medical University.

38:21.280 --> 38:22.560
I have a medical certificate.

38:22.560 --> 38:24.720
Whatever I say, I will answer.

38:24.960 --> 38:26.280
If something happens to the general

38:26.280 --> 38:27.800
None of you can survive.

38:39.560 --> 38:40.560
The lesion was located in his medulla.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.640
The lesion was located in his medulla.

38:44.720 --> 38:46.040
It's incredible.

38:57.280 --> 38:58.640
Do you understand?

38:59.280 --> 39:00.880
I think you should consider

39:00.880 --> 39:03.120
How to apologize to Dr. Gu later.

39:12.400 --> 39:13.640
Let go of values.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.900
Why isn't the general awake yet?

39:16.900 --> 39:18.060
It's been so long since the surgery.

39:18.420 --> 39:20.020
You are not allowed to leave!

39:20.020 --> 39:21.620
You quack!

39:23.000 --> 39:24.480
The general won't wake up so soon.

39:24.480 --> 39:25.960
But the operation was very successful.

39:25.960 --> 39:28.240
Dr. Gu did a perfect job.

39:28.320 --> 39:29.920
The lesion was also perfectly resected.

39:29.920 --> 39:31.200
I underestimated him.

39:31.640 --> 39:33.160
you are wrong?

39:45.320 --> 39:46.120
Dr. Elliot.

39:49.200 --> 39:50.200
Now,

39:51.040 --> 39:51.840
You promised.

39:56.760 --> 39:58.360
as you said,

39:58.360 --> 39:59.720
Dr. Gu is a very good doctor.

40:00.720 --> 40:02.800
I will apologize to him

40:02.800 --> 40:04.040
For everything I do.

40:04.560 --> 40:05.680
PhD. Gu,

40:06.280 --> 40:07.080
sorry.

40:07.600 --> 40:09.160
You're just worried about the general.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.040
When we get the biopsy results

40:11.040 --> 40:12.560
We will keep you posted.

40:13.040 --> 40:13.920
Thanks.

40:29.800 --> 40:30.800
what do I do?

40:32.560 --> 40:33.560
What should we do now?

40:34.200 --> 40:35.720
In the operating room,

40:36.040 --> 40:37.880
You risked your life
to protect me again.

40:40.320 --> 40:41.360
tell me.

40:41.960 --> 40:44.000
When I owed a girl my life twice

40:44.560 --> 40:45.480
How can I repay her?

40:47.080 --> 40:49.120
I don't. do not think too much.

40:50.280 --> 40:51.840
You protected me from the gun.

40:52.480 --> 40:53.560
I have to think too much.

40:54.640 --> 40:55.560
Now,

40:56.560 --> 40:58.720
You tell the health commission representative

40:59.560 --> 41:01.040
I am your idol

41:01.560 --> 41:03.680
You will die for me.

41:04.560 --> 41:06.320
(Idol?)

41:07.360 --> 41:08.360
I see.

41:09.200 --> 41:10.840
I am very touched.

41:11.560 --> 41:14.080
When have I ever said such a thing?

41:14.560 --> 41:15.560
Don't pretend you understand.

41:16.040 --> 41:17.040
you have not?

41:18.280 --> 41:21.880
Maybe I heard what you were saying.

41:33.040 --> 41:34.040
Su Wei'an.

41:36.160 --> 41:37.160
no way

41:37.960 --> 41:40.240
Making fun of your life again.

41:40.960 --> 41:43.160
You can't risk your life.

41:44.560 --> 41:46.120
Not even for me.

41:48.560 --> 41:50.160
while you are still alive,

41:50.560 --> 41:52.200
You can save more people.

41:54.560 --> 41:56.560
It's worth trading my life for yours.

41:56.880 --> 41:57.720
I told you.

41:58.080 --> 41:59.560
Never say this again.

42:00.560 --> 42:02.400
no one's life

42:02.400 --> 42:04.240
Can
be more valuable than others.

42:13.920 --> 42:15.560
Wait a moment.

42:21.440 --> 42:23.120
What? Do you know you are wrong?

42:24.560 --> 42:26.320
Didn't you just say

42:27.720 --> 42:29.440
Don't you know how to repay me?

42:35.440 --> 42:36.440
Give me a raise

42:43.920 --> 42:44.920
Su Wei'an!

42:45.560 --> 42:47.400
Money is better than death, isn't it?

42:52.560 --> 42:55.280
do you know that person

42:55.480 --> 42:57.160
Didn't you even release the safety lock?
