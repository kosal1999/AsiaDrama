05:19.100 --> 05:20.100

who are unwilling to participate in therapy.

visited him in the hospital.

That's why you're
so special to Saquon.

15:03.260 --> 15:04.300
after that,

15:04.580 --> 15:06.500
he suddenly said

15:06.500 --> 15:07.740
He wants to study in France,

15:07.740 --> 15:08.700
go to paris

15:09.940 --> 15:11.420
I'm serious this time

15:11.420 --> 15:13.220
I can no longer accompany him.

15:14.500 --> 15:15.300
when i found out

15:15.980 --> 15:18.740
If Wei An really didn’t go to Paris

15:18.940 --> 15:20.220
And also dropped out of school.

15:20.940 --> 15:23.540
He gave up on the dream he had held on to for so long.

15:23.660 --> 15:24.740
I was completely panicked.

15:24.940 --> 15:26.260
Even Wei An was willing to give up.

15:26.260 --> 15:27.460
What should I do?

15:31.500 --> 15:32.780
Do you think I'm disappointed?

15:33.380 --> 15:34.420
No.

15:36.300 --> 15:37.580
Life is so long.

15:38.660 --> 15:40.500
One day you won't
just follow.

15:40.900 --> 15:42.700
You'll know
what you want to do.

15:43.220 --> 15:44.220
However, what makes me panic

15:44.220 --> 15:45.980
It's that I don't know
what I can do.

15:48.220 --> 15:50.100
Everyone has
their own skills

15:50.100 --> 15:51.580
and preferred areas.

15:52.260 --> 15:53.460
It's just a matter of time.

15:56.300 --> 15:58.700
For example, although Su Weian
is very smart,

15:59.300 --> 16:00.300
I think

16:00.460 --> 16:02.300
You have
advantages that he doesn't have.

16:03.380 --> 16:04.260
What are the advantages?

16:04.380 --> 16:05.220
Try saying it.

16:07.940 --> 16:09.940
You are good to your friends.

16:10.940 --> 16:12.540
What are the benefits of doing this?

16:12.540 --> 16:13.940
I guess what you would say.

16:13.940 --> 16:15.180
Of course this is an advantage.

16:16.300 --> 16:17.820
There are many people who are friendly to their friends.

16:18.460 --> 16:20.420
However, only a few people

16:20.420 --> 16:23.220
He puts the interests of his friends
before his own.

16:23.660 --> 16:25.460
I remember your eyes were already red that day.

16:26.420 --> 16:27.740
You still don't give up on the Boss.

16:28.580 --> 16:29.300
You forced me

16:29.620 --> 16:31.380
Go to the police station
to save Su Wei'an

16:31.700 --> 16:32.460
Very cool.

16:33.340 --> 16:35.420
In addition, I think Su Weian is
also very lucky.

16:35.940 --> 16:37.540
Because he has a friend like you.

16:39.740 --> 16:41.700
Your words almost made me cry.

16:45.460 --> 16:45.900
OK

16:46.700 --> 16:47.940
So, starting from today,

16:49.420 --> 16:51.060
In my friends list,

16:51.660 --> 16:53.500
Added a
male friend named Fang.

17:12.780 --> 17:13.540
higher.

17:21.380 --> 17:22.540
More on the right.

17:39.740 --> 17:40.660
already.

18:17.580 --> 18:18.180
you...

18:19.660 --> 18:21.060
Are you OK?

18:24.020 --> 18:25.380
You tripped on a flat surface

18:26.060 --> 18:27.020
Because of ataxia?

18:27.740 --> 18:29.460
Who suffers from ataxia?

18:31.420 --> 18:32.060
Hypoglycemia.

18:33.540 --> 18:34.460
Is it really possible?

18:38.180 --> 18:38.580
Are you OK?

18:39.460 --> 18:41.460
Check again to see if anyone is injured.

18:44.020 --> 18:44.700
Are you following me?

18:48.060 --> 18:48.740
No.

18:50.740 --> 18:51.740
Calm down.

18:52.260 --> 18:53.580
There are no wounds on my body.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.260
We all have to take PEP medication.

19:06.460 --> 19:07.180
I'm hungry.

19:08.300 --> 19:09.060
Ayo,

19:09.060 --> 19:11.260
Let's go have a meal together

19:43.980 --> 19:44.460
Mali.

19:45.300 --> 19:46.140
Taste it.

19:51.420 --> 19:52.260
Came late today

19:53.460 --> 19:54.500
This is the only thing in the cafeteria.

20:02.900 --> 20:03.540
Su Wei'an.

20:04.820 --> 20:06.060
What’s wrong with you?

20:10.020 --> 20:11.500
my father was

20:12.540 --> 20:13.580
he also likes

20:14.580 --> 20:15.940
Top with two fried eggs.

20:17.700 --> 20:18.500
Your father?

20:21.500 --> 20:22.260
so...

20:24.580 --> 20:25.500
Three years ago, he

20:27.580 --> 20:28.940
Became a star in the sky.

20:35.460 --> 20:39.100
Is this the reason why you don't go to school?

20:39.100 --> 20:40.100
of course not.

20:40.900 --> 20:41.980
It has nothing to do with my father.

20:43.500 --> 20:44.820
I just want to make money.

20:45.260 --> 20:46.420
Earn more money.

20:47.900 --> 20:49.900
There are many opportunities for Lakaya;

20:50.260 --> 20:51.180
Make money fast.

20:51.460 --> 20:52.500
Money comes from everywhere.

20:53.220 --> 20:54.500
Besides, you don't know

20:55.260 --> 20:56.500
Europeans are very generous when it comes to giving

20:57.180 --> 20:58.500
There was no hesitation in tipping.

21:00.460 --> 21:01.460
Su Wei'an.

21:02.180 --> 21:03.220
Is it your family?

21:03.980 --> 21:04.940
Are you really short of money?

21:06.460 --> 21:08.100
Who would think that
money is too much?

21:10.580 --> 21:12.460
People who value money so much...

21:13.220 --> 21:15.980
You can
save people by postponing final exams.

21:17.260 --> 21:18.540
you can help others

21:19.180 --> 21:21.420
Almost considered a murderer.

21:22.820 --> 21:23.500
Do you believe?

21:24.900 --> 21:25.940
Anyway, I don’t believe it.

21:30.460 --> 21:31.740
Make money while studying medicine

21:32.940 --> 21:33.780
I choose to make money.

21:38.020 --> 21:38.740
Su Wei'an.

21:39.500 --> 21:41.460
Did you
make a lot of money in Lakaya?

21:41.820 --> 21:44.300
So much so that it helps Saquon
pay for his medical bills.

21:46.540 --> 21:48.900
I'm like,
why are you so confused?

21:53.740 --> 21:54.460
Guru teacher.

21:55.580 --> 21:56.460
you...

21:57.460 --> 21:59.500
Do you support
Darwin's theory of evolution?

22:00.740 --> 22:01.540
Do you mean...

22:02.300 --> 22:03.460
Living things compete for survival,

22:03.740 --> 22:04.500
The survival of the ruler.

22:06.700 --> 22:09.380
The defective gene
must be removed naturally.

22:11.820 --> 22:12.740
I only believe

22:13.220 --> 22:14.940
About the Hippocratic Oath.

22:16.180 --> 22:18.780
Maintain respect and treatment wherever possible

22:18.780 --> 22:20.460
For every life.

22:21.020 --> 22:21.900
so you

22:23.780 --> 22:26.420
Never experienced a
moment of despair

22:27.180 --> 22:30.020
In what areas are the patients you are treating
not getting better?

22:32.060 --> 22:34.700
We as doctors
have no right to despair.

22:35.220 --> 22:35.900
us

22:36.300 --> 22:38.660
Must survive to the end.

22:39.020 --> 22:40.260
Can not give up.

22:44.460 --> 22:45.060
All because of you.

22:45.060 --> 22:46.460
Who asked
you to chat with me for so long?

22:46.820 --> 22:48.260
There is no one in the cafeteria now.

22:48.340 --> 22:49.220
Who makes dinner?

22:52.820 --> 22:53.420
Su Wei'an.

22:53.700 --> 22:54.260
What are you doing?

22:54.260 --> 22:55.980
Can't let anyone
see us together.

22:55.980 --> 22:57.260
Why can't you just let nature take its course?

22:57.260 --> 22:58.020
Does anyone else see us together?

22:58.220 --> 22:59.420
Yes, why?

22:59.500 --> 23:00.740
What are you guilty of?

23:01.220 --> 23:02.260
I've been hiding

23:02.260 --> 23:03.460
Now that it's out, it's really weird.

23:03.820 --> 23:05.460
Not even a ghost.

23:06.740 --> 23:07.100
look.

23:07.500 --> 23:08.260
There is a boss.

23:09.780 --> 23:10.460
boss.

23:10.700 --> 23:12.180
Doctor Gu, why are you here too?

23:13.460 --> 23:15.220
I...I'm hungry.

23:18.460 --> 23:19.900
Who eats noodles with you?

23:22.060 --> 23:22.500
Where is that person?

23:26.780 --> 23:27.620
nobody.

23:27.860 --> 23:28.620
only myself.

23:30.020 --> 23:31.740
So why are there two bowls of noodles?

23:35.100 --> 23:36.500
I want to eat two bowls of noodles.

23:37.220 --> 23:37.900
Isn't it possible?

23:39.340 --> 23:41.020
Have you used these two pairs of chopsticks ?

23:52.020 --> 23:53.260
I like

23:53.260 --> 23:55.540
A bowl
and a pair of chopsticks.

23:56.260 --> 23:57.460
Isn't it possible?

23:59.580 --> 24:00.460
able.

24:02.260 --> 24:02.900
boss.

24:02.980 --> 24:04.260
Where are you going today?

24:04.860 --> 24:05.980
It seems this is the first time

24:05.980 --> 24:07.260
Were you on vacation after coming here?

24:07.820 --> 24:09.780
I haven't seen you all day,
I'm so...

24:09.780 --> 24:10.820
I'm not used to this.

24:11.700 --> 24:12.700
Me too.

24:12.700 --> 24:14.220
I didn't see Wei An all day.

24:14.420 --> 24:15.460
I'm not used to it either.

24:17.660 --> 24:18.260
boss.

24:18.940 --> 24:19.940
you...

24:28.700 --> 24:29.500
Why us?

24:30.740 --> 24:32.020
I'm not with Su Wei'an.

24:32.220 --> 24:33.940
It’s rare to have an afternoon break

24:33.940 --> 24:35.580
So just take a walk.

24:36.980 --> 24:39.460
Boss, I didn’t ask
you and Su to translate.

24:40.020 --> 24:41.460
Let me ask you and translator Jiang,

24:41.660 --> 24:43.460
Would you like to eat
scallion pancakes or dumplings?

24:46.500 --> 24:47.460
I eat noodles.

24:50.020 --> 24:50.860
Take a seat, Jiang.

24:51.460 --> 24:52.500
I made scallion pancakes for you.

25:00.820 --> 25:01.500
Doctor Gu.

25:03.260 --> 25:04.260
Are you OK?

25:06.780 --> 25:09.340
Why do I feel like
you look nervous?

25:12.300 --> 25:14.220
I...I'm not nervous.

25:14.460 --> 25:15.780
Am I nervous?

25:17.020 --> 25:17.740
No.

25:21.260 --> 25:22.460
good smell.

25:23.780 --> 25:25.460
Mari, cicipi. Jiang Muying.

25:25.740 --> 25:26.940
Scallion pancakes made by the aunt in the cafeteria

25:26.940 --> 25:27.740
very delicious.

25:31.220 --> 25:32.820
what time is it?

25:32.940 --> 25:34.940
Why do you think
Wei An hasn’t come home yet?

25:39.300 --> 25:40.740
Why haven't you gone home yet?

25:43.900 --> 25:45.460
You contact him.

25:46.460 --> 25:47.220
If you can't,

25:47.740 --> 25:48.940
I'll accompany you to pick him up.

25:55.460 --> 25:57.460
What is that sound?

26:04.740 --> 26:06.460
That's...my text message.

26:12.780 --> 26:13.660
short message.

26:17.500 --> 26:18.420
It's hot.

26:21.700 --> 26:22.620
I am too careless.

26:22.740 --> 26:23.420
just me.

26:25.700 --> 26:26.700
just me.

26:36.460 --> 26:38.060
Not hot either.

26:40.980 --> 26:42.420
My hands are relatively sensitive.

26:46.540 --> 26:47.100
Jiang Muying.

26:47.980 --> 26:50.220
Su Wei'an is becoming more and more courageous, isn't he?

26:50.900 --> 26:52.820
You dare to go out alone at this time of night .

26:53.460 --> 26:56.180
Has General Kouyate's anger
subsided?

26:57.100 --> 26:57.660
so...

26:57.740 --> 26:58.220
bad.

26:58.220 --> 27:00.500
The phone only rang once
and then turned off, right?

27:01.260 --> 27:04.220
So, he couldn't have been
captured by General Kouyate, right?

27:04.700 --> 27:06.460
cannot.
I had to... I had to look for it.

27:07.500 --> 27:08.460
Fang Mingfan.

27:09.220 --> 27:11.780
Jiang Muying
went out alone at night

27:11.780 --> 27:12.820
Go find Su Wei'an.

27:13.460 --> 27:15.500
Lakaya is too dangerous

27:16.020 --> 27:17.460
Are you calm?

27:23.660 --> 27:24.500
Wait for me, Jiang.

27:42.100 --> 27:43.260
Why do you want to scare Jiang?

27:44.300 --> 27:45.500
He really came out to me.

27:45.820 --> 27:47.180
If I don't kick him out

27:47.500 --> 27:49.900
Do you still have a chance to blame me now
?

27:50.460 --> 27:51.660
You call him quickly.

27:51.740 --> 27:52.900
It can also call him back.

27:53.820 --> 27:54.500
This is also true.

27:58.740 --> 27:59.460
Hello, Teacher Jiang.

28:01.180 --> 28:01.780
I...

28:02.220 --> 28:02.940
I am fine.

28:03.740 --> 28:05.540
Just on the road

28:06.060 --> 28:07.020
Meet old customers

28:07.020 --> 28:08.260
and had dinner with him.
that's right.

28:10.940 --> 28:11.700
I'm back.

28:11.700 --> 28:12.500
Wait for me in the room.

28:15.060 --> 28:15.500
Until it was discovered.

28:18.020 --> 28:18.780
I go first.

28:21.900 --> 28:22.900
slowly.

[Moutai buying price (official) 42,710 francs,

29:06.020 --> 29:08.020
Why don't you
look at other people's stuff carefully?

29:08.780 --> 29:09.780
I don't know whose it is.

29:10.220 --> 29:11.940
If you don't know who it is from
, you shouldn't watch it.

29:12.260 --> 29:13.300
Don't know whose it belongs to

29:13.300 --> 29:15.020
So you have to look at
who it actually belongs to

29:15.300 --> 29:16.220
Return it to its owner.

29:18.220 --> 29:19.780
Then, what did you see?

29:22.020 --> 29:23.020
What did I see?

29:25.700 --> 29:28.220
I see other people
's obsession with making money.

29:28.460 --> 29:30.180
And the ability to calculate everything.

Su Wei'an,

29:38.220 --> 29:39.500
I started to really believe it

29:39.500 --> 29:41.820
You would give up studying medicine to make money.

Dad, Mom, I still have a project book
to read.

I'll go up first.

Go to bed early and
don't stay up late.

42:07.920 --> 42:08.600
