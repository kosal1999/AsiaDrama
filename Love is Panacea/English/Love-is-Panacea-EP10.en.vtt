[Panakea Cinta]
[Vol. 10]

01:25.980 --> 01:27.980
[2022 Sichuan Provincial Literature and Art Project Funded Works]

01:27.980 --> 01:29.980
[Adapted from
the lemon language novel "Panakea Cinta"]

01:32.340 --> 01:32.980
slower.

01:37.620 --> 01:38.500
Slow down, Fang Mingfan.

01:38.500 --> 01:39.220
This is a mountain road.

01:39.540 --> 01:40.540
scared?

01:41.660 --> 01:42.660
I'm not afraid.

01:46.180 --> 01:47.300
You still want to go with me.

01:51.100 --> 01:52.620
If
something happens to us,

01:53.180 --> 01:54.620
How can we
save Vian and the Doctor? Gu?

01:56.980 --> 01:58.540
If you follow our
very slow pace...

01:58.740 --> 01:59.420
slower.

02:01.060 --> 02:02.620
We thought it would be nice if we could arrive before dawn.

02:04.660 --> 02:05.660
What should we do?

02:06.180 --> 02:07.860
Their cell phones
must be out of battery.

02:08.860 --> 02:11.860
I called them earlier
but that also failed.

02:14.420 --> 02:15.060
cannot.

02:16.540 --> 02:17.980
The young boss never
gave up on me.

02:18.660 --> 02:19.980
I can't live without him either.

02:20.660 --> 02:21.540
What does "give up on you" mean?

02:21.540 --> 02:22.620
Why should I give up on you?

02:24.180 --> 02:25.420
Didn't you ask?

02:25.780 --> 02:27.180
What is the mortality rate for the surgery I have
?

02:29.100 --> 02:30.420
I said before that I didn't record.

02:33.300 --> 02:35.300
In fact, during
my first surgery...

02:38.300 --> 02:39.980
The patient died
on the operating table.

02:42.540 --> 02:43.540
That night...

02:46.620 --> 02:47.580
The patient's vital signs are unstable.

02:47.980 --> 02:48.980
Blood pressure 82/48 mmHg.

02:48.980 --> 02:49.980
Blood oxygen saturation is 70%.

02:52.300 --> 02:53.420
This is a blood blister aneurysm.

02:53.780 --> 02:55.300
Bleeding spots must
be treated immediately.

02:55.780 --> 02:57.540
How long until the Doctor arrives?

02:57.540 --> 02:58.740
PhD. He still has diarrhea.

02:58.820 --> 03:00.100
Director Zhang is also
performing another operation.

03:00.740 --> 03:02.340
Blood oxygen saturation
is below 70%.

03:02.340 --> 03:03.820
The amount of bleeding has exceeded 1000 ml.

03:04.340 --> 03:05.660
Can't wait any longer.

03:05.660 --> 03:06.660
Perform surgery immediately.

03:06.980 --> 03:07.780
PhD. He just asked you

03:07.780 --> 03:08.980
Maintain patient's vital signs.

03:09.260 --> 03:10.100
If you operate now,

03:10.180 --> 03:11.700
You must
take responsibility for this operation.

03:12.260 --> 03:13.420
Blood vesicle aneurysm.

03:13.940 --> 03:15.500
This is the most difficult and risky surgery
.

03:15.860 --> 03:16.460
Can you do it?

03:17.420 --> 03:18.460
if i don't try

03:19.220 --> 03:20.460
He will definitely die.

03:21.620 --> 03:22.340
Perform surgery immediately.

03:22.740 --> 03:23.580
Absorbent gelatin sponge.

03:31.020 --> 03:32.660
The patient was in shock and
required immediate blood transfusion.

03:34.540 --> 03:35.700
The patient's heart stopped.

03:35.700 --> 03:36.940
Perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) immediately.

03:58.060 --> 03:59.420
PhD. It's funny if he doesn't come

03:59.420 --> 04:00.220
The patient is dying,

04:00.220 --> 04:01.180
what can I do?

04:01.500 --> 04:02.940
Don't you want me to let him die?

04:03.820 --> 04:05.020
You only had surgery.

04:05.020 --> 04:06.460
Never had
aneurysm surgery.

04:06.460 --> 04:07.940
How can you do this without permission?

04:08.300 --> 04:10.300
Fortunately, the patient's family members
are reasonable and do not blame you.

04:10.300 --> 04:12.940
Take a good look at yourself.

04:16.540 --> 04:18.620
No matter what you say, he
can't even deal with an aneurysm.

04:18.620 --> 04:20.340
How dare he perform surgery without waiting for the attending doctor.

04:20.340 --> 04:21.620
Why should he perform well?

04:21.740 --> 04:22.700
PhD. He said that some people

04:22.700 --> 04:24.340
No talent.
Just become a surgeon.

04:24.940 --> 04:25.980
I think in our unit,

04:25.980 --> 04:27.620
No medical team
dared to admit him.

04:41.060 --> 04:42.980
(Try what you say, he can't even
handle an aneurysm.)

04:42.980 --> 04:44.700
(How dare he perform surgery without waiting for the attending doctor.)

04:44.940 --> 04:46.220
(Why does he have to act so well?)

04:46.380 --> 04:47.340
(Dr. He said that some people)

04:47.340 --> 04:48.980
(There is no natural talent for being a direct surgeon
.)

04:49.580 --> 04:50.620
(I think in our unit,)

04:50.620 --> 04:52.260
(No medical team dares to admit him now .)

05:00.580 --> 05:01.780
(You only had surgery.)

05:01.780 --> 05:03.220
( Aneurysm surgery has never been performed .)

05:03.220 --> 05:04.700
(How can you
do this without permission?)

05:05.060 --> 05:07.060
(Fortunately, the patient’s family members
are reasonable and don’t blame you.)

05:07.060 --> 05:09.620
(Take a good look at yourself.)

05:13.300 --> 05:15.220
(Try what you say, he can't even
handle an aneurysm.)

05:15.220 --> 05:16.940
(How dare he perform surgery without waiting for the attending doctor.)

05:17.180 --> 05:18.460
(Why does he have to act so well?)

05:18.940 --> 05:20.260
(Why did he die?)

05:24.860 --> 05:26.460
At that time everyone thought
my career was over,

05:28.020 --> 05:29.020
Including myself.

05:31.180 --> 05:32.900
So, dr. Can I help you in the future?

05:35.900 --> 05:37.900
Do you know why I
keep calling him little boss?

05:40.460 --> 05:41.820
He's only two levels above me.

05:43.940 --> 05:45.780
But he and I are completely opposite people.

05:47.060 --> 05:49.180
His first surgery
made him famous.

05:49.780 --> 05:52.300
Presided over thalamic tumor surgery when he was young

05:53.660 --> 05:55.660
Become
a legend in the Neurosurgery Department of Huaren Hospital.

05:56.660 --> 05:58.260
I just don't think so

05:58.940 --> 06:00.660
He will tell useless people

06:00.660 --> 06:01.900
So that everyone ignored it,

06:03.300 --> 06:05.780
About to resign
and change fields...

06:09.380 --> 06:10.380
"You're unhappy."

06:12.660 --> 06:13.900
"I need an assistant."

06:24.660 --> 06:25.580
Fang Mingfan.

06:29.020 --> 06:29.580
why are you back

06:31.300 --> 06:31.780
What?

06:32.420 --> 06:34.500
I mean since you
have decided to give up

06:34.500 --> 06:35.780
Why are you still coming to the hospital?

06:37.060 --> 06:38.060
I am used to it.

06:40.780 --> 06:41.940
Maybe this is also instinct.

07:35.800 --> 07:36.440
Fang Mingfan.

07:38.600 --> 07:40.720
Regarding transnasal sphenoidal approach to pituitary tumor surgery,

07:40.840 --> 07:41.640
How much do you understand

07:43.040 --> 07:44.120
I used to study video

07:44.600 --> 07:45.640
And have seen
some lecturers do this.

07:47.160 --> 07:48.880
So, I'm sorry to upset you.

07:50.360 --> 07:51.360
I need a senior assistant.

07:55.880 --> 07:56.600
I can.

07:58.800 --> 08:01.120
Then the little boss
also came to help with the charity work here.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.200
I don't want it either

08:03.200 --> 08:04.720
Face those
who point fingers at China.

08:05.600 --> 08:06.640
So, I followed him here.

08:09.320 --> 08:10.280
So from that point on, Dr. Gu,

08:10.280 --> 08:12.320
From a senior boss to
a young boss?

08:14.600 --> 08:16.200
So, why is he
so partial to you?

08:16.720 --> 08:18.640
I once asked him why he chose me.

08:19.360 --> 08:20.560
He is not partial.

08:21.440 --> 08:24.040
He said he didn't want to see
defectors.

08:25.680 --> 08:26.360
He doesn't like defectors.

08:29.920 --> 08:30.360
after that?

08:30.640 --> 08:32.120
When will you
start again?

08:32.120 --> 08:33.150
Second surgery?

08:41.640 --> 08:42.840
I'm not ready yet.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.120
I know I'm useless.

08:50.640 --> 08:51.640
Do not say.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.120
You are useless, not as bad as me.

08:57.840 --> 08:58.560
If you are not ready yet,

08:58.560 --> 08:59.840
So it takes time to prepare.

09:00.880 --> 09:03.320
Life is so long,
there will definitely be a next time.

09:09.640 --> 09:10.360
There will definitely be a next time.

09:12.280 --> 09:14.360
I think the mobile charity clinic
is just ahead,

09:14.840 --> 09:16.360
We are here waiting for them.

09:16.520 --> 09:17.600
Wait until it gets a little lighter
before continuing the search.

09:24.600 --> 09:25.040
Mali.

09:25.880 --> 09:26.320
Be careful.

09:32.040 --> 09:32.640
May I?

09:33.640 --> 09:34.360
I have nothing.

09:53.600 --> 09:54.120
Gu Yunzheng.

09:55.120 --> 09:55.840
Gu Yunzheng.

09:56.880 --> 09:57.680
Bangun, Gu Yunzheng.

10:01.680 --> 10:02.680
Don't fall asleep.

10:04.320 --> 10:05.120
Don't worry.

10:06.600 --> 10:07.600
I didn't pass out.

10:07.880 --> 10:09.040
I'm just sleepy.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.560
Doing charity therapy all day

10:12.400 --> 10:13.680
The road is so long.

10:14.440 --> 10:15.320
Really tired.

10:18.680 --> 10:19.880
If you feel uncomfortable,

10:20.560 --> 10:21.400
must tell me yes

10:23.920 --> 10:24.640
Su Wei'an.

10:25.880 --> 10:26.840
to be honest,

10:28.120 --> 10:30.840
I'm glad you took care of me.

10:31.640 --> 10:32.640
so,

10:33.800 --> 10:35.600
If you feel uncomfortable,

10:35.880 --> 10:37.280
I'll just say it.

10:40.120 --> 10:41.040
Rest first.

10:45.960 --> 10:46.960
This cannot go on.

10:47.440 --> 10:48.200
I went to the rescuers.

10:48.200 --> 10:48.920
wait for me here.

10:56.160 --> 10:57.360
Be careful, Su Wei'an.

10:59.600 --> 11:00.640
quickly.

11:06.160 --> 11:06.640
hurry up.

11:25.960 --> 11:26.720
Situ.

11:30.360 --> 11:31.040
Gu Yunzheng.

11:32.040 --> 11:32.760
Gu Yunzheng.

11:33.480 --> 11:34.000
Gu Yunzheng.

11:35.160 --> 11:35.760
wake up.

11:37.200 --> 11:37.680
Gu Yunzheng.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.440
I was shocked.

11:46.440 --> 11:48.240
You are really strong.

11:49.640 --> 11:50.120
How are you?

11:53.960 --> 11:56.040
I really don't want to wake up.

11:56.960 --> 11:59.160
If only you'd wake me up in two seconds

12:00.400 --> 12:01.720
i can kiss you

12:03.040 --> 12:04.400
so far.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.440
Next time if you have
this kind of dream again, don't involve me anymore.

12:10.960 --> 12:11.400
how?

12:12.760 --> 12:14.000
You are busy with everything,

12:14.640 --> 12:16.040
Get ready to get busy again and figure out
other people's dreams.

12:22.200 --> 12:22.720
Wei'an.

12:24.440 --> 12:24.840
quickly.

12:25.000 --> 12:25.800
Please carry him inside.

12:25.800 --> 12:26.760
What happened to the young boss?

12:28.000 --> 12:28.760
what happen?

12:28.760 --> 12:29.280
What’s wrong with you?

12:29.540 --> 12:32.660
【Friendly Hospital】

12:44.960 --> 12:45.960
you're awake.

12:47.000 --> 12:47.880
How do you feel now?

12:49.240 --> 12:49.720
Thirsty.

12:57.640 --> 12:58.160
Drink water first.

12:58.680 --> 13:00.040
Drinking plenty of water
can boost your metabolism.

13:09.440 --> 13:09.760
hungry.

13:10.960 --> 13:12.240
Do you want to eat porridge?

13:19.720 --> 13:20.320
Unable to wake up.

13:21.240 --> 13:22.160
It doesn't matter. I don't want to eat it.

13:22.440 --> 13:23.280
I bribe you.

13:27.120 --> 13:27.720
Mali.

13:27.840 --> 13:28.720
You picked me up.

13:36.840 --> 13:38.160
am I wrong?

13:38.800 --> 13:41.640
Wei'an sedang suap Dr. Gu.

13:47.560 --> 13:48.400
both of them

13:48.400 --> 13:50.480
What to do in Kampung Rabe at night
?

13:52.720 --> 13:54.240
Vian looked like
a different person.

13:54.240 --> 13:55.240
PhD. me too.

13:57.040 --> 13:58.240
While in the village, they would not

13:59.320 --> 14:00.760
eat any kind of fruit

14:01.520 --> 14:02.480
Will it be poisoned like this?

14:44.960 --> 14:45.760
Good morning, Sister Lan.

14:46.240 --> 14:47.840
Why are you
making a video call to your mom?

14:48.240 --> 14:50.000
I'm
already late for dancing in the square.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.400
Square dance?

14:52.520 --> 14:54.120
Isn’t it Beijing time now?

14:54.120 --> 14:55.000
Is it only eight o'clock in the morning?

14:56.000 --> 14:57.440
Workers don’t even get up that early.

14:58.640 --> 15:00.200
Well, I
chatted with you for a while.

15:01.480 --> 15:02.480
wrong.

15:03.280 --> 15:04.560
Today is the weekend,

15:04.560 --> 15:06.800
You're just sitting in the hospital.

15:06.920 --> 15:08.400
If there is no class,
you take a test.

15:08.480 --> 15:09.960
At least,
go to the library and sit.

15:10.920 --> 15:12.400
You came to France in vain,

15:13.400 --> 15:15.720
I don’t want to just enjoy life.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.680
Who said I
am in the hospital every day?

15:18.440 --> 15:20.920
Last week, I went to
the village for a charity therapy session.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.240
Feel the experience and atmosphere of the French countryside

15:23.240 --> 15:24.800
and the customs and habits of the local people.

15:25.760 --> 15:28.440
You treat villagers
instead of going to the hospital,

27:17.200 --> 27:19.400
This is something that modern medicine cannot explain.

27:19.800 --> 27:21.520
Therefore, we need to find another way.

27:23.640 --> 27:25.360
Go all the way to the end
and turn right.

27:26.800 --> 27:29.040
As I said before,
the fare is doubled.

27:32.600 --> 27:33.960
Great, no problem.

27:48.560 --> 27:50.160
Is this the shaman's house you're talking about?

27:54.840 --> 27:55.840
Yes, it's a bit unique.

27:56.960 --> 27:58.320
Did he go outside for treatment?

28:02.240 --> 28:03.040
look,

28:03.960 --> 28:05.000
Navigation brought me here.

28:07.480 --> 28:08.280
OK

28:08.720 --> 28:10.040
I also want to find a shaman

28:10.400 --> 28:11.440
Open a branch here.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.080
Mesra Hospital
Untreatable Diseases,

28:13.080 --> 28:14.960
Asking for help Dr. Gu
brought them here yes.

28:15.040 --> 28:16.360
You will definitely be able to make a lot of profits.

28:19.240 --> 28:20.200
I have no idea,

28:20.400 --> 28:21.800
This tree has a soul.

28:22.840 --> 28:23.640
you do not say,

28:24.440 --> 28:25.240
my leg

28:27.080 --> 28:29.280
I no longer feel pain.
Look at this.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.120
hurry up.

28:42.760 --> 28:43.880
I'll take you to a place.

28:50.760 --> 28:51.560
Look at that.

28:57.040 --> 28:58.200
really beautiful!

29:01.400 --> 29:04.000
This bridge was built by the Chinese.

29:04.640 --> 29:06.160
I have been in
Lakaya for more than a year

29:06.840 --> 29:08.640
I have passed through so
many bridges built by the Chinese.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.080
Every time I think like this,

29:12.880 --> 29:13.840
In all this
there is not one or the other

29:13.840 --> 29:15.400
Built by my mom.

29:20.640 --> 29:21.680
Of course there is.

29:22.840 --> 29:26.040
Your mother is
a respectable woman.

29:31.960 --> 29:32.640
that's right.

29:33.480 --> 29:34.760
if she wasn't my mother

29:35.440 --> 29:36.240
perhaps

29:37.480 --> 29:38.920
i will love him

29:48.000 --> 29:49.320
Let's ask him how he is.

29:52.920 --> 29:53.720
Hello!

30:00.800 --> 30:02.000
Hello!

30:02.000 --> 30:03.280
Are you OK?

30:17.440 --> 30:19.440
Is this a replica bridge?

30:21.880 --> 30:24.400
It is said that
a light festival is held here every year.

30:25.160 --> 30:27.000
It’s just that I’ve lived in Lakaya for so long,

30:27.200 --> 30:28.440
There is no chance to join yet.

30:29.720 --> 30:30.520
that's right.

30:31.680 --> 30:34.440
Maybe it's because you
are too busy looking for money.

30:40.160 --> 30:41.880
You ran so fast just now,

30:42.960 --> 30:44.200
Are your legs no longer sore?

30:44.800 --> 30:47.120
sick. Still uncomfortable.

31:11.200 --> 31:12.000
Do you want to try it?

31:27.880 --> 31:28.880
Nothing wrong?

31:29.800 --> 31:30.680
Nothing wrong?

31:31.480 --> 31:32.520
I tell you,

31:33.240 --> 31:36.000
This game
releases the hormone dopamine in us,

31:36.000 --> 31:37.320
let's get excited

31:37.880 --> 31:39.320
The same goes for having sex.

31:40.240 --> 31:42.280
It seems that I am
more effective than the shaman.

31:42.440 --> 31:44.000
Your leg seems
to be healed.

31:44.960 --> 31:45.640
Pay.

31:47.000 --> 31:47.840
Why?

31:48.160 --> 31:50.760
The hostage
demands money from the kidnapper.

31:50.880 --> 31:52.360
You look more like a hostage than me
.

31:54.760 --> 31:55.840
If you want money, there isn't any.

31:56.240 --> 31:58.000
If you want this person,
you can change it to yours.

31:59.480 --> 32:00.240
What did you say?

32:00.240 --> 32:01.240
I didn't hear it.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.840
You stopped
performing again.

32:05.080 --> 32:05.960
Didn't you hear?

32:06.280 --> 32:07.080
You guessed it.

32:08.640 --> 32:09.440
We are dizzy again.

32:10.640 --> 32:11.440
hurry up!

32:33.840 --> 32:35.800
Suddenly out of nowhere,

32:37.840 --> 32:39.240
When will this all be available?

32:39.440 --> 32:40.680
That day was mountain time,

32:41.600 --> 32:43.760
I'm hungry, thirsty, and
scared.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.080
So
I prepared a little earlier this time.

32:46.080 --> 32:47.240
Be prepared for any eventuality?

32:47.840 --> 32:48.840
this thing

32:48.840 --> 32:51.640
Essential for outdoor survival.

32:55.840 --> 32:57.880
Is this also important for
surviving outside?

33:00.440 --> 33:02.440
You shouldn't underestimate
this picnic mat.

33:03.200 --> 33:05.680
It is moisture-proof, waterproof
and wear-resistant.

33:05.880 --> 33:07.360
This is a must-have item

33:07.360 --> 33:08.440
Go travel.

33:09.960 --> 33:10.760
brother,

33:11.760 --> 33:13.160
We are in the desert now .

33:13.160 --> 33:14.520
You talked to me
about waterproofing and moisture-proofing.

33:15.360 --> 33:16.520
Be prepared for any eventuality?

33:20.000 --> 33:20.800
This one too?

33:23.360 --> 33:26.440
Do you remember our time in the mountains?

33:26.440 --> 33:28.240
Our cell phones are
running out of battery, right?

33:28.240 --> 33:32.200
This type of battery will
last longer. look.

33:33.560 --> 33:34.360
oh.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.720
So what you mean is,

33:37.160 --> 33:38.600
We'll hang it on ourselves later

33:39.080 --> 33:39.880
For lighting?

33:40.840 --> 33:42.360
You can hang it
high.

33:42.840 --> 33:45.120
Try looking at it this way.

33:47.600 --> 33:49.320
It would look beautiful if hung on a tent.

33:50.840 --> 33:51.640
tent?

33:57.440 --> 33:58.920
Are you ready to bring your tent?

34:05.040 --> 34:06.600
Wei An, are you thirsty?

34:06.960 --> 34:10.190
I saw you
finished your drink.

34:13.960 --> 34:14.760
no.

34:15.360 --> 34:16.320
where is my water

34:18.880 --> 34:20.360
Who turned it into alcohol?

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
where is my water

34:26.080 --> 34:26.880
no.

34:39.230 --> 34:40.600
(Alcohol gives people courage.)

34:41.000 --> 34:41.840
(You two are cowards.)

34:42.280 --> 34:43.760
(I can only help so far.)

34:45.260 --> 34:46.580
【Friendly Hospital】

34:59.440 --> 35:00.240
Obviously,

35:02.040 --> 35:03.160
Only drink.

35:06.120 --> 35:06.920
Quench your thirst.

35:08.280 --> 35:09.360
Have some wine to quench your thirst.

35:23.360 --> 35:24.720
Very comfortable.

35:26.600 --> 35:28.000
It feels like a long time ago

35:28.280 --> 35:29.520
Not enjoying the tranquility of the night

35:29.520 --> 35:31.000
comfortably.

35:34.040 --> 35:35.400
No need to think about anything.

35:37.040 --> 35:38.120
Just need to be quiet

35:38.120 --> 35:39.760
Enjoy the beauty of the night sky.

35:40.280 --> 35:41.120
me too.

35:42.240 --> 35:43.600
I used to do this every day

35:43.600 --> 35:45.560
Busy as a machine.

35:46.240 --> 35:48.720
But never
stop and think for a moment

35:50.040 --> 35:51.600
What do I work for?

35:58.520 --> 35:59.320
Oh yes.

36:00.240 --> 36:03.000
I've finished the wine and
can't go back.

36:05.680 --> 36:06.680
Don't worry.

36:06.840 --> 36:09.520
As long as I'm here,
you're safe.

36:11.480 --> 36:12.880
However, I also think that

36:13.200 --> 36:15.080
You are the source of danger.

36:19.080 --> 36:20.600
Do you think I
've reached that point?

36:20.960 --> 36:22.280
Although I love you,

36:22.720 --> 36:24.240
I won't take advantage of you either.

36:27.240 --> 36:28.920
But I will.

36:30.440 --> 36:31.360
What did you say?

36:33.040 --> 36:34.080
No.

36:38.240 --> 36:39.040
OK

36:41.760 --> 36:43.320
you are great too.

36:43.320 --> 36:44.120
must be.

36:45.440 --> 36:46.040
Taste it first.

36:46.040 --> 36:47.080
odor.

36:51.280 --> 36:52.320
use this.

36:53.040 --> 36:54.800
No, I'm not cold either.

36:55.280 --> 36:56.400
Drinking alcohol can warm the body.

36:58.040 --> 36:58.840
OK

36:59.840 --> 37:00.640
Hurry up and give it a try.

37:05.440 --> 37:06.320
let's go

37:07.840 --> 37:09.480
Cheers to beauty tonight.

37:10.240 --> 37:11.040
OK

37:12.560 --> 37:13.360
drink!

37:30.200 --> 37:31.320
Why do we fight?

37:32.280 --> 37:35.480
The winner may make one request.

37:36.680 --> 37:37.600
Against what?

37:41.040 --> 37:42.320
Opponents look for zodiac signs.

37:42.840 --> 37:44.560
Whoever can find the most people
wins.

37:45.240 --> 37:46.040
how?

37:47.040 --> 37:49.600
I was in an astronomy club in college.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.000
Do you really want
to fight me?

37:51.200 --> 37:52.800
Is it really great?

37:53.640 --> 37:56.080
I once took
a tour group to the desert.

37:56.080 --> 37:58.640
Clients taught me and
I also learned Chinese and French.

37:58.640 --> 38:01.240
Are these hearsays of yours
credible?

38:04.480 --> 38:06.920
Believe it or not,
your opponent knows first.

38:08.480 --> 38:09.400
Why?

38:09.760 --> 38:12.560
Or do you think that
lecturers lose to students?

38:12.640 --> 38:13.920
Is your face watering?

38:16.400 --> 38:17.280
Classmate Su.

38:18.040 --> 38:21.280
What kind of strange desire to win is this?

38:21.960 --> 38:24.760
Let's get in the car
and go fight.

38:33.840 --> 38:34.640
Bintang Orion.

38:40.440 --> 38:41.240
how is it like?

38:43.960 --> 38:44.840
do you know?

38:45.640 --> 38:47.000
Betelgeuse is a star

38:47.000 --> 38:49.560
Bright orange,
a thousand times larger than the sun.

38:50.440 --> 38:51.280
Betelgeuse...

38:52.040 --> 38:54.040
The stars of Ursa Major and Ursa Minor.

38:59.880 --> 39:00.760
Su Wei'an.

39:01.640 --> 39:02.880
Do you really want to fight?

39:03.240 --> 39:05.200
Aren't you afraid of losing and
crying behind you?

39:05.560 --> 39:06.760
If you haven't started looking yet,

39:06.760 --> 39:08.160
You will definitely lose.

39:10.040 --> 39:10.840
OK

39:12.040 --> 39:13.880
Now that I can find
those two stars,

39:14.240 --> 39:15.600
Not hard to find...

39:16.160 --> 39:16.800
Draco star.

39:17.200 --> 39:17.960
Cassiopeia star.

39:22.200 --> 39:25.080
Gemini, Auriga.

39:25.240 --> 39:26.080
Auriga?

39:26.080 --> 39:26.760
of.

39:27.600 --> 39:28.640
Did you come up with this name?

39:28.640 --> 39:30.160
Why should I create?

39:30.280 --> 39:31.840
Skilled driver.

39:31.880 --> 39:33.120
Where? Let me get closer.

39:35.400 --> 39:36.120
Situ.

39:36.680 --> 39:38.760
Have you seen
the brightest star?

39:39.240 --> 39:40.720
Its name is Capella,

39:41.360 --> 39:44.520
It is one of the main stars in the constellation Auriga.

39:46.880 --> 39:49.000
A lonely star.

39:51.280 --> 39:53.200
what you see is

39:54.560 --> 39:55.760
A pair of major stars.

39:57.440 --> 39:59.760
They are a pair of twin stars.

40:00.440 --> 40:02.880
They are very close together in orbit
.

40:03.040 --> 40:05.800
They
revolve around the same center of mass.

40:07.840 --> 40:08.640
it mean,

40:09.960 --> 40:11.600
They are not alone.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.440
I said four stars before.

40:19.640 --> 40:21.760
You just said three, so I win.

40:26.240 --> 40:27.360
Where could that be?

40:27.640 --> 40:29.040
I haven't finished speaking yet.

40:29.040 --> 40:29.840
Did you say that?
