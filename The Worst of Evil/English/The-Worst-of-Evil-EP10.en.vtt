00:01.793 --> 00:08.591
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS OF THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL.

00:21.479 --> 00:22.480
Boss.

00:23.106 --> 00:24.399
Let's drink soju.

00:33.658 --> 00:36.703
Why didn't you tell me

00:39.539 --> 00:40.790
What about the Japanese?

00:40.874 --> 00:42.667
You handled the situation with China.

00:43.168 --> 00:44.502
Me, with the Japanese.

00:45.962 --> 00:47.589
Anyway, everything went well.

00:48.173 --> 00:49.924
Sorry for not telling you sooner.

00:51.926 --> 00:53.219
Regarding Lee Haeryun,

00:53.303 --> 00:54.596
How is everything going with her?

00:55.263 --> 00:56.639
She just is

00:57.724 --> 00:58.767
a business partner.

00:59.642 --> 01:00.769
Nothing else.

01:01.519 --> 01:05.148
Come on man.
You know you can tell me everything.

01:14.574 --> 01:18.036
Now that I think about it, everything turned out well.

01:19.245 --> 01:21.039
The Chinese trust you,

01:22.248 --> 01:25.210
and the old man he traded with
is already dead.

01:26.461 --> 01:28.379
We have new Japanese contacts,

01:30.173 --> 01:32.342
It will be a good starting point.

01:35.595 --> 01:37.138
A starting point?

01:38.515 --> 01:39.849
What do you mean, sir?

01:39.933 --> 01:41.643
When all this is closed,

01:42.185 --> 01:43.937
I'm getting out of this business.

01:44.020 --> 01:45.021
That?

01:45.105 --> 01:50.401
You will be in charge.

01:51.945 --> 01:52.862
Boss.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.739
Now I have a new goal.

01:57.700 --> 01:58.910
A normal life.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.288
I want to be a normal man

02:03.248 --> 02:04.916
with a safe and quiet life.

02:09.796 --> 02:12.132
I had never thought about it like that.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.386
But since I met Euijeong again,

02:17.595 --> 02:21.057
I was thinking what it should be

02:21.141 --> 02:22.976
someone worthy of her.

02:24.853 --> 02:27.814
So from now on
I'll show him that I've changed

02:28.731 --> 02:30.859
and I will live an honest and decent life.

02:30.942 --> 02:31.985
Boss.

02:39.868 --> 02:40.994
In shop

02:41.828 --> 02:44.330
that Euijeong is a police officer. He knows.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.709
Will he continue dating a police officer?

02:50.420 --> 02:51.421
Yes, he is a police officer.

02:52.714 --> 02:55.383
That's why I want to be
a person worthy of her.

03:01.973 --> 03:03.683
Boss Seo is very irritable,

03:04.851 --> 03:07.270
and Heesung had a son
and has a lot of worries.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.690
Seungho, you're perfect for this.

03:17.113 --> 03:18.281
I'm sure you'll do well.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.200
I believe in you.

03:34.589 --> 03:40.845
THE WORST OF EVIL

03:43.806 --> 03:44.807
Boss.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.978
Are you seriously going out of business?

03:49.771 --> 03:51.356
That's why I go here.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.442
Is this not good for you?

04:12.919 --> 04:14.295
Are you waiting for someone?

04:16.798 --> 04:17.799
Euijeong.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.054
I see. She invited Euijeong.

04:23.137 --> 04:24.472
Little by little, I will show you

04:25.265 --> 04:26.557
how I have changed.

04:28.810 --> 04:29.811
Hello, you came.

04:30.603 --> 04:31.813
Seungho also came.

04:32.563 --> 04:33.564
Yeah.

04:33.648 --> 04:35.900
How is your wound? Are you OK?

04:37.735 --> 04:38.778
Yeah.

04:39.153 --> 04:41.239
-Let's go in.
-Good.

04:46.703 --> 04:49.580
The Free International City
and airport planning

04:49.706 --> 04:53.418
Aim to make Yeongjong
the center of East Asian trade

04:53.501 --> 04:57.088
as the largest port of the 21st century.

04:57.672 --> 05:01.050
The total estimated cost of the project
is 132.9 billion won,

05:01.134 --> 05:06.973
and construction
will last from 1995 to 2001.

05:07.432 --> 05:10.018
Now I will show you current photos

05:10.101 --> 05:12.270
from the islands Yeongjongdo,
Yongyudo and Muuido.

05:12.353 --> 05:14.272
You will also see conceptual plans

05:14.355 --> 05:17.442
of the Free International City
and the new airport completed

05:17.525 --> 05:20.945
on the comparison slides.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.280
Slides, please.

05:25.366 --> 05:26.993
There we went, to Muuido Island.

05:29.454 --> 05:33.249
And next door is Yeongjongdo Island.

05:34.125 --> 05:37.295
Now there is only occupancy
during the summer,

05:37.378 --> 05:40.590
but when this deal is closed,
people will visit her...

05:41.132 --> 05:43.676
And the Marine Tourist Complex
is next door.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.680
Secondly,
if you look at the illustrations,

05:48.598 --> 05:50.808
the International Fishing Village

05:50.892 --> 05:54.354
It is in the center
of the Marine Tourist Complex.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.314
must have made a fortune

05:56.397 --> 05:58.775
to invest in this type of business.

06:01.110 --> 06:02.653
By the way, what are you going to do?

06:04.364 --> 06:05.615
I'm talking about Yankees.

06:07.700 --> 06:11.329
Where did you hide it?
It forces me on a useless search.

06:11.412 --> 06:12.413
Let's go.

06:13.414 --> 06:15.375
If you continue without saying anything,

06:16.209 --> 06:18.336
I won't stop following him like now.

06:24.634 --> 06:27.637
Wait. Did he also get rid of the Yankees?

06:28.596 --> 06:29.806
Same as with Cho?

06:31.265 --> 06:34.143
Could it be located,
given the circumstances?

06:37.522 --> 06:40.024
Clear. I will speak low.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.236
Listen.

06:43.319 --> 06:44.320
What a pity.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.614
I know

06:47.198 --> 06:50.076
who is the owner of the Gangnam Crystal.

06:51.160 --> 06:54.831
The punishment for a drug crime
is less than for homicide.

06:55.665 --> 06:59.043
Why don't you quit drug trafficking
and turn yourself in?

07:00.336 --> 07:03.965
If you do, I will turn a blind eye
to Manager Cho's murder.

07:04.799 --> 07:05.967
I won't investigate further.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.055
I do not know what is he talking about.

07:16.185 --> 07:18.729
I'll give you some advice.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.191
Stop drug trafficking

07:22.775 --> 07:25.319
to the unsuccessful.

07:25.403 --> 07:27.405
He's too good for that.

07:28.531 --> 07:30.074
Leave it to the losers.

07:38.916 --> 07:40.334
Do what I tell you.

07:41.085 --> 07:44.172
And I will find out why Mr. Cheon died

07:44.964 --> 07:48.092
as a thank you gift.

07:57.977 --> 08:00.271
We are making history,
so to speak.

08:01.147 --> 08:05.818
Now I present
to you our main investor

08:05.902 --> 08:08.488
in the
tourism and entertainment district.

08:08.571 --> 08:11.657
Jung Gicheul, director
of Gangnam Industries, will say a few words.

08:15.745 --> 08:16.913
Let's go.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.168
Mr. Jung Gicheul!

08:23.377 --> 08:26.005
Mr. Jung!

08:26.088 --> 08:28.132
Here it comes!

08:28.216 --> 08:31.594
Mr. Jung!

08:35.973 --> 08:37.391
Hola.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.185
What is this?

08:40.186 --> 08:41.854
¿"Grande Joie"?

08:41.938 --> 08:43.481
It looks good.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.067
¡Bravo!

08:49.070 --> 08:50.404
Let's go.

08:50.488 --> 08:53.199
Did you take their faces?

08:53.282 --> 08:54.909
Yes, I took photos of all of them.

08:54.992 --> 08:55.993
Genial.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.079
This one is very good.

09:02.583 --> 09:03.876
Hola.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.170
My name is Jung Gicheul
from Gangnam Industries.

09:06.796 --> 09:10.132
Our host gave
an excellent explanation,

09:10.216 --> 09:12.635
so I'll be brief.

09:13.553 --> 09:18.474
The Free International City,
as a commercial district and...

09:19.517 --> 09:22.895
Will they let Hwang Mingoo
continue to meddle in everything?

09:22.979 --> 09:26.148
He just saw Euijeong's face.

09:27.066 --> 09:30.194
Shouldn't we control
that crazy shit?

09:32.154 --> 09:35.241
If that bad boy Hwang Mingoo

09:35.324 --> 09:37.285
stop Jung Gicheul before us,

09:38.369 --> 09:40.997
all our work will be in vain.

09:41.747 --> 09:44.542
We'll be screwed! They understand?

09:45.167 --> 09:46.294
Let's act quickly.

09:49.880 --> 09:53.092
Doesn't it seem like Jaegeon's people
warned Hwang Mingoo

09:53.676 --> 09:55.845
about Jung Gicheul's drug trafficking?

09:55.928 --> 09:56.929
Yeah.

09:58.306 --> 10:00.266
That guy is insufferable.

10:02.977 --> 10:04.562
Hi sir.

10:04.645 --> 10:06.314
It's because of Inspector Hwang Mingoo.

10:06.397 --> 10:07.315
Yes sir.

10:07.398 --> 10:09.859
It continues to interfere with our work.

10:11.319 --> 10:13.988
How can I help you with that, sir?

10:14.071 --> 10:17.241
Keep me up to date
with your daily activities.

10:17.325 --> 10:21.495
And tell him to take it easy.

10:21.579 --> 10:23.205
Understood?

10:23.706 --> 10:24.999
Yes sir.

10:25.082 --> 10:26.626
I will keep you informed. Bye bye.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.720
They all arrived early.

10:42.183 --> 10:45.311
This is Seungho's girlfriend,
Miss Lee Haeryun.

10:46.187 --> 10:49.398
And this is my girlfriend, Miss Yu Euijeong.

10:49.482 --> 10:50.816
Enchanted.

10:58.074 --> 10:59.283
We know each other, right?

11:01.369 --> 11:02.411
Enchanted.

11:04.038 --> 11:06.082
I heard they went to the same school.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.291
Sit down please.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.170
They told me he's a police officer.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.714
Is it corrupt then?

11:20.930 --> 11:22.098
It was a joke.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.768
He even fired a gun
to save Mr. Jung's life.

11:26.644 --> 11:27.895
You must love him very much.

11:29.772 --> 11:31.565
What do you do, Haeryun?

11:31.649 --> 11:33.484
It's not rude to ask, right?

11:34.985 --> 11:36.320
I manufacture drugs.

11:45.037 --> 11:46.247
It was a joke.

11:49.667 --> 11:50.876
He believed it?

11:51.419 --> 11:52.795
But you are a police officer.

11:52.878 --> 11:53.879
How adorable.

11:54.296 --> 11:56.340
Haeryun's father is Korean-Chinese.

11:56.424 --> 11:57.633
And we have a good relationship.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.428
Seeks to invest
in Seoul's restaurant business.

12:00.511 --> 12:02.430
Korean-Chinese, I understand.

12:02.513 --> 12:03.472
From what part of China?

12:05.015 --> 12:06.600
De Beijing.

12:06.684 --> 12:10.604
Haeryun helps her father with finances.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.231
And with the time,

12:12.314 --> 12:14.692
hopes to invest in real estate
here in Korea.

12:14.775 --> 12:15.693
Is right.

12:16.610 --> 12:19.655
The only thing I have is money.

12:20.197 --> 12:22.616
It must be nice to be rich.

12:24.827 --> 12:26.871
You must be very in love.

12:26.954 --> 12:30.708
It's not easy to be a couple again
after dating in high school.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.547
The first time
must have left a mark.

12:43.053 --> 12:44.054
Don't you find it funny?

12:46.807 --> 12:48.017
What a difficult audience.

12:48.809 --> 12:50.060
It must be because he's a police officer.

12:56.358 --> 12:58.736
It must be because he works
in a family business.

12:58.819 --> 13:00.029
She is very funny.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.909
Are they in a relationship now?

13:09.413 --> 13:11.957
Well, we are...

13:12.041 --> 13:14.710
In commercial terms,

13:14.794 --> 13:16.837
-We are very...
-I like him a lot.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.224
And you, Seungho?

13:36.398 --> 13:38.484
Do not say it. It's cheesy.

13:41.028 --> 13:42.238
And you, Euijeong?

13:44.114 --> 13:45.950
Don't you have a problem
dating Mr. Jung?

13:46.033 --> 13:47.910
-He's a police officer.
-Why not?

13:49.662 --> 13:51.705
You know what Mr. Jung does.

13:53.165 --> 13:54.583
Don't they judge her for that?

13:55.417 --> 13:56.418
What is it referring to?

13:58.712 --> 14:00.589
What Gicheul does or has done

14:02.299 --> 14:05.386
I don't mind.

14:06.136 --> 14:07.888
He promised he would change.

14:10.724 --> 14:11.976
And I believe him.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.402
What fun.

14:21.735 --> 14:22.987
But I have to go.

14:23.529 --> 14:25.531
I don't like to measure my words.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.367
Let's go have a drink?

14:30.744 --> 14:32.329
It was fun, Euijeong.

14:46.051 --> 14:48.470
Honestly, I'm not interested
in real estate.

14:52.433 --> 14:54.560
It is my grandfather's homeland,

14:55.978 --> 14:58.022
I want to study, work,

14:59.690 --> 15:02.860
date men and succeed.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.863
Like any Korean.

15:09.325 --> 15:10.576
It's the only thing I want.

15:12.703 --> 15:13.746
And I hope to do it with you.

15:29.428 --> 15:30.429
Hola.

15:31.221 --> 15:32.181
How much they cost?

15:32.264 --> 15:34.016
Three thousand won for five.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.353
I want this.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.563
I like the red one better.

15:39.647 --> 15:41.482
Five red apples.

15:42.232 --> 15:45.235
In China, people love
receiving apples as gifts.

15:46.403 --> 15:47.404
Because?

15:47.488 --> 15:51.075
Because they are a symbol of peace.

15:55.913 --> 15:57.665
Tome.

15:57.748 --> 16:01.502
Do you remember when Mr. Jung
gave me a watch

16:01.585 --> 16:03.170
I just arrived in Korea?

16:03.253 --> 16:05.255
In China, we never give watches as gifts.

16:08.008 --> 16:11.220
It means you will die when it stops.

16:21.814 --> 16:22.815
It's delicious?

16:24.525 --> 16:26.944
It's very rich. Thank you.

16:31.782 --> 16:32.783
Sorry.

16:33.951 --> 16:35.119
That?

16:35.202 --> 16:37.079
Por Lee Haeryun.

16:37.162 --> 16:38.288
She was very rude.

16:40.708 --> 16:41.709
No problem.

16:42.251 --> 16:43.335
I understand.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.380
But we won't have to see it again.

16:49.383 --> 16:50.384
As you say?

16:51.051 --> 16:52.511
You saw the investment talk.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.975
From now on,
I will only introduce you to good people.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.067
I promised you I would change

17:08.193 --> 17:09.445
and I want to keep that promise.

17:39.975 --> 17:40.976
Haeryun.

17:42.186 --> 17:45.689
I would like ours to last.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.317
And for that,

17:49.943 --> 17:53.238
How about we keep our distance?

17:53.947 --> 17:55.074
At least, for now.

17:55.699 --> 17:56.909
Distance?

17:58.994 --> 17:59.995
That's OK?

18:02.372 --> 18:03.373
Or better

18:04.208 --> 18:05.250
that far?

18:09.922 --> 18:12.382
Very good.
We will see each other for a long time.

18:17.971 --> 18:19.932
From now on, I will live in Korea.

18:24.394 --> 18:25.813
My father gave me permission.

18:29.483 --> 18:30.484
Where did you get this from?

18:30.567 --> 18:31.693
RESIDENT CARD

18:31.777 --> 18:34.363
From now on,
I am not Lee Haeryun, Korean-Chinese.

18:34.446 --> 18:36.198
I'm Lee Sunyoung, Korean.

18:40.410 --> 18:41.537
What are you thinking?

18:47.084 --> 18:49.545
When you're with me, you seem distracted.

18:52.047 --> 18:53.048
Oh really?

18:53.132 --> 18:54.133
Yeah.

18:57.219 --> 18:58.428
Do you think about work?

18:59.263 --> 19:00.264
Or do you think

19:02.224 --> 19:03.392
on someone else?

19:07.521 --> 19:08.814
I'm not sure.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.360
Maybe I'm bad
at expressing my feelings.

19:16.363 --> 19:17.781
Do you feel something for me?

19:21.285 --> 19:22.828
If you didn't notice,

19:22.911 --> 19:25.330
It's just that I'm terrible at expressing it.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.085
Seungho, when you are with me,

19:31.879 --> 19:33.714
I want full attention.

19:35.799 --> 19:36.884
Know?

19:40.137 --> 19:43.223
I like you a lot.

19:53.984 --> 19:55.861
Do I have your attention yet?

20:00.574 --> 20:03.660
I'm very confused.

20:04.578 --> 20:05.579
What's happening?

20:09.249 --> 20:10.334
The thing is...

20:11.210 --> 20:12.711
Believe

20:13.879 --> 20:15.047
that maybe I like you

20:16.924 --> 20:18.508
More than I thought

20:21.011 --> 20:22.346
hereinafter.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.613
Hello. Sit down.

20:39.738 --> 20:40.781
Come on, sit down.

20:41.531 --> 20:44.952
Let's put this puzzle together.

20:45.535 --> 20:47.663
Manager Cho, Yankees,

20:48.121 --> 20:50.332
Mr. Cheon, Gangnam Syndicate.

20:50.707 --> 20:53.001
-What do they all have in common?
-That?

20:53.085 --> 20:54.086
The drug.

20:56.296 --> 20:58.882
I'm glad you're here.

20:59.299 --> 21:03.679
You must know
all the heavyweights

21:03.762 --> 21:05.889
of drug trafficking better than me.

21:06.682 --> 21:07.683
Is right.

21:10.102 --> 21:10.978
TRUE?

21:11.061 --> 21:13.522
Write your names, damn it!

21:13.605 --> 21:14.773
Whatever comes to mind.

21:14.856 --> 21:17.567
Think of all the names
you remember.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.945
-Yes sir!
-You have to find Manager Cho.

21:20.028 --> 21:22.114
-Yes sir!
-Very good.

21:22.197 --> 21:25.409
Write everything about those who manufacture,
sell and buy drugs.

21:25.492 --> 21:26.868
Their names, nicknames,

21:26.952 --> 21:28.870
addresses and even relatives.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.372
-Alright?
-Yes sir!

21:30.455 --> 21:32.916
-Everything that comes to mind.
-Yes sir!

21:33.917 --> 21:35.752
Those names are great.

21:35.836 --> 21:38.672
"Gullebang Bridge". Carajo. "Godori".

21:39.381 --> 21:40.590
Meth Park.

21:41.216 --> 21:42.718
They forgot Meth Park.

21:43.260 --> 21:44.553
-Mr. Meth Park.
-Clear!

21:45.971 --> 21:47.472
-¿Meth Park?
-Se dice

21:47.556 --> 21:49.850
That all the gangnam dope

21:49.933 --> 21:52.853
arrives at Meth Park
before going to the clients.

21:52.936 --> 21:54.146
That's how famous he is.

21:54.229 --> 21:57.190
Surely not even the Yankees can sell it

21:57.274 --> 21:58.525
without him trying it.

21:58.608 --> 22:02.696
That Meth Park guy
should meet with the Yankees, right?

22:02.779 --> 22:04.114
That's how it is.

22:04.197 --> 22:05.449
What are you doing?

22:05.532 --> 22:08.118
-That?
-Call Meth Park!

22:08.869 --> 22:10.954
-Call it!
-Come on.

22:11.580 --> 22:12.789
Call him right now.

22:13.749 --> 22:15.917
Hello. It's me, Dodgers.

22:16.585 --> 22:20.630
I have ten packages of imported snacks.

22:20.714 --> 22:23.050
Would you be interested in trying some?

22:23.842 --> 22:26.970
They're delicious.

22:27.596 --> 22:29.056
Call me if you are interested.

22:31.141 --> 22:32.225
You finished?

22:32.309 --> 22:34.770
Can I call my girlfriend, Mingoo?

22:36.855 --> 22:39.900
Lock him up until Meth Park
contacts us.

22:39.983 --> 22:41.651
Yes sir. Get up.

22:49.284 --> 22:50.369
Kwon Seungho.

22:50.452 --> 22:51.453
Yes sir?

22:51.536 --> 22:54.539
How was your date with Lee Haeryun?
All good?

22:54.623 --> 22:56.458
Unfortunate. You slept with her, didn't you?

22:56.541 --> 22:57.667
Of course he went to bed.

22:58.502 --> 23:00.879
That's why I wanted to go.

23:01.421 --> 23:02.756
Let's eat.

23:05.467 --> 23:06.468
Sit down.

23:07.135 --> 23:09.554
We already solved the problem
of the Chinese and the Japanese.

23:09.638 --> 23:11.390
Let's cheer to that.

23:15.811 --> 23:18.146
Hell, I was really popular too.

23:19.314 --> 23:20.315
Oh really?

23:21.191 --> 23:22.192
Be careful.

23:22.776 --> 23:24.736
If you get her pregnant, you'll end up like me.

23:34.830 --> 23:37.833
I'll tell you how things are,
so listen carefully.

23:38.792 --> 23:41.211
Jinpo Port, Jeolla Province.

23:41.294 --> 23:43.964
We set sail from there, we load the drugs,

23:44.047 --> 23:45.465
Let's go straight to Pohang

23:45.549 --> 23:48.301
and we deliver it to our people.

23:48.385 --> 23:51.638
Half of the money we earn from this
goes to the company,

23:51.721 --> 23:53.473
and we share the rest.

23:54.057 --> 23:56.893
The boss got 40%,
and Jungbae and I got 30.

23:56.977 --> 23:58.562
But now we are four,

23:59.896 --> 24:01.064
how do we divide it?

24:01.815 --> 24:03.358
You and I keep 30%.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.610
And the other two will receive 20%.

24:07.070 --> 24:08.280
You already heard it.

24:09.281 --> 24:12.242
Wait, you'll get 10% less.

24:13.785 --> 24:16.163
Seungho is the one who contributes the most, he deserves it.

24:17.247 --> 24:18.415
Gracias.

24:21.710 --> 24:22.794
That...?

24:24.463 --> 24:27.007
Who is our man in Pohang?

24:27.090 --> 24:31.094
A guy we know, captain of a ship
traveling between Korea and Japan.

24:31.511 --> 24:33.472
When will the Chinese send the drugs?

24:33.847 --> 24:35.432
They said that soon,

24:35.515 --> 24:36.933
They will let me know.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.314
Okay, Chief SEO.

24:43.690 --> 24:45.025
Do you remember Hwang Mingoo?

24:45.484 --> 24:46.485
Yes sir.

24:46.568 --> 24:48.945
Is he chasing us again?

24:51.281 --> 24:52.866
Maybe we should get rid of him.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.076
That shitty cop.

24:57.996 --> 24:59.164
I'll keep it in mind.

25:13.345 --> 25:14.346
Señor.

25:14.846 --> 25:15.764
Hello, LA.

25:15.847 --> 25:18.934
Are you serious, brat?

25:19.017 --> 25:20.143
Do you believe

25:21.269 --> 25:24.147
What will you fix me with crumbs?

25:24.397 --> 25:28.151
Hello, LA.

25:29.819 --> 25:31.530
Soy Dodgers.

25:31.613 --> 25:34.616
Is the same.

25:34.699 --> 25:36.618
It doesn't change much.

25:37.994 --> 25:41.581
Where are the imported snacks?

25:42.707 --> 25:44.626
Come on, sir.

25:44.709 --> 25:46.127
You're weird.

25:46.211 --> 25:47.963
You know I like you, right?

25:50.173 --> 25:53.927
Sueltame.

25:54.511 --> 25:55.971
Crazy shit.

25:56.054 --> 25:58.223
You're high, right?

25:58.306 --> 26:00.058
You're the one who's high.

26:01.685 --> 26:02.769
Who are you?

26:03.270 --> 26:06.147
I? A drug addict hunter

26:06.231 --> 26:07.566
who came to catch one.

26:07.649 --> 26:10.068
PARK JAEMAN

26:10.151 --> 26:12.571
CRIMINAL RECORD

26:12.654 --> 26:17.701
You're older than I thought.

26:18.243 --> 26:20.120
Sorry if I was rude.

26:20.203 --> 26:21.997
It was very dark,

26:22.080 --> 26:24.207
I didn't recognize you, sir.

26:24.291 --> 26:25.709
Have a cigarette, please.

26:25.792 --> 26:26.626
I apologize.

26:27.335 --> 26:29.546
I don't usually behave like that.

26:29.629 --> 26:30.922
I know I shouldn't,

26:31.006 --> 26:34.384
but sometimes it happens,
since I deal with a lot of people.

26:36.344 --> 26:38.513
Don't call me "sir", I don't like it.

26:39.931 --> 26:43.101
My son and daughter-in-law are police officers.

26:43.184 --> 26:44.728
If that's true,

26:44.811 --> 26:47.689
My son is an Olympic medalist.

26:48.565 --> 26:50.984
Drug addicts always lie.

26:52.319 --> 26:55.196
I don't know where Yankees is.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.032
GOOD.

26:57.532 --> 26:58.533
So, sir,

27:02.746 --> 27:04.831
Who cooks the Gangnam Crystal?

27:04.914 --> 27:07.083
I thought he was looking for the Yankees.

27:07.167 --> 27:09.794
I don't care about that idiot.

27:10.378 --> 27:12.964
I want to catch the big fish.

27:13.048 --> 27:14.049
A Jung Gicheul.

27:16.551 --> 27:19.596
Drug addicts
don't work with gangsters.

27:19.679 --> 27:21.640
I guess I didn't know,

27:23.391 --> 27:24.851
fucking idiot

27:34.402 --> 27:37.030
I love it.

27:37.113 --> 27:39.032
He has guts.

27:40.575 --> 27:42.994
What a charmer.

27:43.912 --> 27:47.957
That's why I call you "sir."

27:50.502 --> 27:51.503
Señor.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.964
What if we become friends?

27:57.884 --> 28:00.136
Good things could happen.

28:01.930 --> 28:03.139
At a business level, of course.

28:10.105 --> 28:11.106
Alright?

28:18.321 --> 28:20.907
Mr. Lee called me.

28:20.990 --> 28:23.702
Hwang Mingoo detained
a drug addict last night and questioned him.

28:23.785 --> 28:25.203
His name is Park Jaeman.

28:26.371 --> 28:30.250
Does it mean Hwang Mingoo
is getting into drug trafficking?

28:32.711 --> 28:33.795
One moment.

28:35.046 --> 28:36.297
What's the guy's name?

28:36.381 --> 28:37.549
Park...

28:38.508 --> 28:39.509
"Park Jaeman".

28:42.679 --> 28:43.722
Do you know him?

28:45.640 --> 28:47.308
Inspector Park's father

28:48.017 --> 28:49.227
His name is Park Jaeman.

28:50.895 --> 28:53.314
Let's not say anything to Inspector Park.

29:10.915 --> 29:11.791
Señor.

29:13.418 --> 29:15.712
Why did you go to the Gangnam Police Station?

29:16.629 --> 29:18.465
They arrested me and took me away.

29:18.548 --> 29:20.258
I didn't go voluntarily.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.260
Why was he released?

29:23.803 --> 29:27.640
They wanted to know about someone else,
not me.

29:28.892 --> 29:31.811
I didn't say anything,
so they can't do anything.

29:33.354 --> 29:36.649
Did the inspector tell you anything else?

29:38.735 --> 29:43.907
Sir, I want to ask you a favor.

29:44.324 --> 29:46.993
That detective who arrested him, Hwang Mingoo,

29:47.994 --> 29:49.454
Don't meet him again.

29:49.996 --> 29:53.291
Even if he forces you, don't tell him anything.

29:53.374 --> 29:55.710
Especially about Junmo and his wife.

30:03.384 --> 30:04.594
I would appreciate.

30:09.432 --> 30:15.605
DAEJI HOSTEL

30:44.467 --> 30:45.718
Hello, Dohyung.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.137
¿Yankees?

30:49.764 --> 30:51.808
He disappeared from the face of the earth
a long time ago.

30:52.350 --> 30:54.853
Some say
he stowed away to China.

30:55.311 --> 30:57.021
And others say he was stabbed to death.

30:57.105 --> 30:59.774
for involvement in a homicide.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.901
Are you sure you don't know anything?

31:01.985 --> 31:04.028
You know I've never lied to you.

31:04.112 --> 31:05.947
You even helped me stop using

31:06.030 --> 31:08.324
to be able to live
as a decent human being.

31:08.408 --> 31:10.910
Where did you hear about the homicide?

31:13.621 --> 31:17.792
That hurts!

31:18.418 --> 31:19.419
Wendy told me.

31:22.171 --> 31:24.883
That's the name of Yankees' girlfriend.

31:25.508 --> 31:27.677
It seems that he told Wendy

31:27.760 --> 31:30.847
that he was involved in a homicide,
that he had to comply and leave.

31:32.640 --> 31:33.975
Where is he now?

32:14.682 --> 32:16.684
¡Sueltame!

32:16.768 --> 32:17.769
I am Police.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.690
If you tell me where Yankees is,

32:22.774 --> 32:24.484
I will not accuse you of manufacturing drugs.

32:25.568 --> 32:27.987
I am the one who is looking for it,

32:28.613 --> 32:30.490
please tell me where to find it.

32:32.450 --> 32:35.078
That cretin ran away
with all the money we made.

32:37.246 --> 32:39.165
Do you know Manager Cho?

32:39.707 --> 32:41.793
I know that son of a bitch.

32:42.669 --> 32:44.837
We make quite a bit of money from this.

32:45.505 --> 32:47.173
But after he died,

32:47.256 --> 32:48.466
I had to take care of everything.

32:49.050 --> 32:50.301
Did you know?

32:50.385 --> 32:51.427
What thing?

32:51.511 --> 32:54.013
That Manager Cho died
or the Gangnam Syndicate?

32:55.556 --> 32:56.891
What a cheesy name.

32:57.183 --> 32:58.893
Tell them everything you know.

32:59.644 --> 33:01.437
You have to tell the police

33:01.521 --> 33:03.898
that's the man

33:03.982 --> 33:05.149
who killed Manager Cho.

33:08.236 --> 33:12.156
What if I get screwed
after getting involved in this case?

33:13.032 --> 33:15.910
You don't seem to be
in a good situation here either.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.453
I'm not talking about prison.

33:18.746 --> 33:20.248
I'm talking about a psychiatric hospital.

33:22.291 --> 33:24.419
I don't want to give birth in prison either.

33:25.503 --> 33:27.213
I guess a hospital would be better.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.719
Psychiatric or not, it's a hospital.

33:43.062 --> 33:45.815
CASE: HOMICIDE
ACCUSED: SEO JONGRYEOL

33:47.066 --> 33:49.068
You must keep your promise, okay?

33:49.902 --> 33:53.239
Cops always lie,
I can't trust you.

33:59.287 --> 34:02.832
If this goes well,
I'll send you there instead of a mental hospital.

34:02.915 --> 34:03.750
WOMEN'S HOUSE

34:03.833 --> 34:07.045
It will be easier to start from scratch there.

34:10.590 --> 34:11.966
And please stop using.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.468
For the sake of your baby.

34:15.720 --> 34:18.723
If everything goes as planned,
you will be arrested.

34:18.806 --> 34:20.600
The prosecution already knows about this,

34:21.517 --> 34:24.979
so you will come out
when they send you to them.

34:26.647 --> 34:27.732
GOOD.

34:28.149 --> 34:30.651
Anyway, my life is already ruined.

34:30.735 --> 34:32.278
I guess I'll trust you.

34:33.279 --> 34:34.655
Leave.

34:36.199 --> 34:37.200
I have to relax.

34:45.458 --> 34:49.921
GANGNAM POLICE STATION

34:56.052 --> 34:57.303
-Mingoo.
-Hola, Dodgers.

34:57.386 --> 34:59.180
-But you promised...
-We have a guest.

35:01.599 --> 35:02.683
Wendy.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.770
Mingoo, she is Yankees' girlfriend.

35:05.853 --> 35:07.480
Look at this fucking idiot.

35:07.563 --> 35:09.315
So long, Dodgers.

35:10.817 --> 35:13.569
I heard someone
sucking the police officers' cocks.

35:13.653 --> 35:14.862
It was you.

35:14.946 --> 35:17.240
With everyone here, this is a disaster.

35:17.323 --> 35:20.284
Is it a reunion of drug addicts or what?

35:21.828 --> 35:22.912
Oye, Wendy.

35:26.541 --> 35:29.293
Why the hell
does everyone have those names?

35:29.794 --> 35:34.423
They told me they're looking
for the son of a bitch from the Yankees.

35:34.507 --> 35:36.050
That's how it is.

35:36.134 --> 35:38.886
If you know that I'm looking for Yankees,

35:39.720 --> 35:42.932
You should know what information I need.

35:43.015 --> 35:45.309
I know. That's why she came.

35:45.393 --> 35:46.644
Bien, Wendy.

35:47.728 --> 35:50.064
What do I want to know?

35:50.148 --> 35:52.733
You want to know who killed Manager Cho.

35:55.236 --> 35:58.197
You are good.

36:00.449 --> 36:01.534
But, you will see,

36:03.578 --> 36:05.621
what I have now is so tasty,

36:05.705 --> 36:08.124
which attracts many more flies.

36:09.500 --> 36:11.419
Why should I believe

36:11.502 --> 36:13.254
your fucking lies

36:13.713 --> 36:16.257
if you appear at such a convenient time?

36:16.340 --> 36:18.217
If you don't want to trust me, don't.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.225
Lend me your lighter.

36:28.811 --> 36:31.564
What do I do with this beauty?

36:32.481 --> 36:34.650
With the damn civil government,

36:34.734 --> 36:37.612
fucking Gen X kids
don't respect the police.

36:37.695 --> 36:39.071
Damn, am I going to have

36:40.156 --> 36:41.490
than beat you up?

36:45.620 --> 36:46.621
What is this?

36:47.413 --> 36:48.623
The jacket.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.918
It's the one Yankees used
the day Manager Cho died.

36:53.211 --> 36:54.670
Do you see the blood stain?

36:56.881 --> 37:00.968
He did it when Manager Cho
gave him a tremendous beating.

37:01.510 --> 37:04.096
And since they beat him so much,

37:04.889 --> 37:07.683
The Gangnam Union eliminated Cho
because he supports the Yankees.

37:07.767 --> 37:08.768
I know.

37:08.851 --> 37:11.229
I know that too.

37:11.312 --> 37:12.980
But there is no proof.

37:13.773 --> 37:16.150
It brings me trouble to the Yankees.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.735
Not this crap.

37:21.447 --> 37:22.657
Seo Jongryeol.

37:26.327 --> 37:27.453
How do you know him?

37:29.705 --> 37:33.042
Yankees said that Seo Jongryeol
killed Manager Cho.

37:34.168 --> 37:36.170
And that he had already killed before.

37:36.254 --> 37:37.838
What the fuck?

37:38.464 --> 37:41.175
This gets interesting.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.266
-Hey.
-Don't come near me.

37:50.559 --> 37:52.353
Why do you cooperate?

37:53.896 --> 37:55.147
If we add that idiot,

37:56.315 --> 37:59.110
Everyone is looking for the idiot from the Yankees.

37:59.193 --> 38:02.029
But since they can't find him,
they all come looking for me.

38:03.447 --> 38:05.700
They told me that you were looking for me too.

38:05.783 --> 38:07.868
Stop it, you fucking whore.

38:08.577 --> 38:11.539
What if those thugs
are looking for me too?

38:11.622 --> 38:14.250
I don't want to end up like Manager Cho.

38:15.584 --> 38:17.044
And I'm tired of this life.

38:23.509 --> 38:25.553
-What is this?
-It's glass.

38:26.846 --> 38:30.266
The jerk from Yankees
left me these few bags.

38:31.851 --> 38:33.060
Why do you smell them?

38:33.144 --> 38:34.103
As if you knew.

38:34.645 --> 38:36.689
Are these all Yankees?

38:39.275 --> 38:41.193
How will I know?

38:41.277 --> 38:43.446
It's drugs, nothing more.

38:44.405 --> 38:45.614
Mingoo.

38:46.949 --> 38:48.701
By possession of this amount,

38:49.201 --> 38:51.037
Lock me up until this case is over.

38:51.746 --> 38:53.331
And give me spending money.

38:55.458 --> 38:57.084
What the hell...?

38:57.168 --> 38:58.836
In gratitude.

38:58.919 --> 39:01.922
You had everything planned, right?

39:02.256 --> 39:05.343
I think they call it a reward
for passing on information about a crime.

39:05.843 --> 39:07.386
or whatever.

39:09.430 --> 39:11.098
As you will see, I am pregnant.

39:13.642 --> 39:17.521
I don't want to get involved
in this case, Mingoo.

39:22.276 --> 39:24.236
Do you promise to testify as a witness?

39:37.208 --> 39:38.751
Fucking thugs.

39:38.834 --> 39:41.212
Are they off to cause trouble again?

39:42.463 --> 39:44.215
Didn't I tell you to get situated...?

39:44.298 --> 39:46.842
This is how the Government is positioned, idiot.

39:46.926 --> 39:48.219
-Son of a bitch...
-What?

39:48.302 --> 39:51.347
Hey, blind man. You will come with us.

39:51.889 --> 39:52.890
Handcuff him.

39:52.973 --> 39:54.725
You're dead, son of a bitch.

39:54.809 --> 39:56.352
hope

39:56.977 --> 39:58.229
Why do this?

39:58.312 --> 40:01.774
Wasn't the beating I gave you enough for you?

40:02.691 --> 40:04.819
Wait your turn. You are next.

40:10.282 --> 40:11.784
Stop acting tough.

40:12.410 --> 40:13.619
You're a...

40:14.286 --> 40:17.957
You are detained for the murder
of drug trafficker Manager Cho.

40:18.040 --> 40:22.128
You can remain silent
or do whatever the hell you want.

40:22.503 --> 40:24.004
But I warn you that you are screwed.

40:24.505 --> 40:25.506
Take it away.

40:28.259 --> 40:29.927
Young Gicheul.

40:30.010 --> 40:33.556
It's strange that he wasn't caught,
so I'll keep investigating.

40:34.348 --> 40:37.643
I told him what he should do
if he wanted to have a peaceful life.

40:37.726 --> 40:38.727
He remembers?

40:39.854 --> 40:41.105
He doesn't have much time left.

40:42.565 --> 40:43.566
See you.

40:45.109 --> 40:46.277
That damn...

40:46.360 --> 40:47.445
Let's go.

40:52.741 --> 40:55.161
Bad fucking birth!

40:55.619 --> 40:57.037
Good. We're in prison.

41:03.127 --> 41:04.128
What did he say?

41:06.380 --> 41:07.798
I was asking,

41:08.841 --> 41:11.469
and it seems
that Yankees' girlfriend cooks drugs

41:12.052 --> 41:14.972
and told the police
everything he told her.

41:16.223 --> 41:18.476
But why did he
only snitch on Chief Seo?

41:20.561 --> 41:22.271
Yankees was not there that day.

41:22.354 --> 41:24.148
How did you know that Chief Seo killed him?

41:26.901 --> 41:28.194
Jungbae.

41:28.527 --> 41:30.362
Find out what he's up to now.

41:30.446 --> 41:31.614
Why Jungbae?

41:31.697 --> 41:34.658
He's the only one who was there
that day and now he's not here.

41:39.288 --> 41:40.289
Seung Ho.

41:41.582 --> 41:42.541
Yes sir?

41:42.625 --> 41:44.960
ask your girlfriend

41:45.044 --> 41:46.378
if we can get more

41:46.462 --> 41:48.506
16 kilos this time.

41:48.589 --> 41:51.091
If they have more in stock, let's buy everything.

41:51.383 --> 41:52.885
Can I ask why?

41:52.968 --> 41:53.969
It is not obvious?

41:54.678 --> 41:57.264
We don't know how Chief Seo will respond,

41:57.348 --> 41:59.558
nor what will Hwang Mingoo do.

41:59.642 --> 42:01.060
Nothing is certain now.

42:01.143 --> 42:03.145
We have to win a lot while we can.

42:03.229 --> 42:04.522
Don't you think so?

42:04.605 --> 42:06.273
The fucking mother.

42:11.987 --> 42:14.281
Can we trust Seo Jongryeol?

42:14.823 --> 42:17.868
What if he names Jung Gicheul,
Hong Heesung and you ?

42:18.661 --> 42:20.538
and everything gets worse?

42:20.621 --> 42:21.664
No.

42:21.747 --> 42:24.583
He won't speak easily. Don't worry.

42:25.876 --> 42:27.711
That jerk Hwang Mingoo will leave everything

42:27.795 --> 42:30.172
when you get tired of wasting time.

42:30.297 --> 42:32.466
Also, Seo Jongryeol

42:34.176 --> 42:37.972
He is not an original member of the band,
so they will continue the business without him.

42:40.182 --> 42:41.183
But those bullies

42:42.226 --> 42:45.062
They must be very nervous
with the police so close.

42:45.604 --> 42:48.190
I think they're planning a big last hit.

42:48.857 --> 42:51.485
They want to import everything they can.

42:52.903 --> 42:54.613
That's good for us.

42:55.948 --> 42:57.324
Dohyung.

42:57.408 --> 43:00.244
This business will be
our last chance.

43:02.121 --> 43:03.122
Junmo.

43:05.082 --> 43:06.083
That?

43:06.208 --> 43:07.334
Do not exaggerate.

43:07.418 --> 43:09.503
What are you saying?

43:09.878 --> 43:11.755
We did a lot to get here.

43:13.257 --> 43:15.718
Sung Kisoo's retirement from Jaegeon Group,

43:16.677 --> 43:18.679
the death of Kanemoto and Lee Haeryun.

43:22.349 --> 43:23.684
Don't forget that you are a police officer.

43:24.435 --> 43:25.811
So you can go back to your work.

43:29.732 --> 43:30.816
Don't worry.

43:32.109 --> 43:33.193
I can return.

43:35.404 --> 43:36.614
I can return.

43:50.419 --> 43:52.338
I'm from Yeoksam High School,
31st class.

43:52.421 --> 43:54.423
Mr. Jung sent you a message.

43:55.049 --> 43:57.843
"Don't worry
and invoke the right not to declare.

43:58.010 --> 43:59.595
The police always lie.

44:00.179 --> 44:01.930
We were the only ones there.

44:02.556 --> 44:04.683
I will hire the best lawyer in the country.

44:05.267 --> 44:07.478
Don't worry." That's what he said.

44:16.987 --> 44:17.863
Hola.

44:17.946 --> 44:19.740
Hola.

44:19.823 --> 44:21.784
I'm from the Seoul Metropolitan Police.

44:23.369 --> 44:26.705
I heard you caught Manager Cho's murder suspect
.

44:26.789 --> 44:28.916
We are also interested in that case.

44:29.792 --> 44:31.585
I came to see how everything was going.

44:32.294 --> 44:36.382
You didn't kill Manager Cho, did you?

44:41.303 --> 44:44.473
Right not to declare.

44:46.850 --> 44:47.851
Hey, blind man.

44:49.311 --> 44:51.063
Cut her with that if you don't want to die.

44:57.319 --> 44:58.320
Bueno.

45:00.614 --> 45:01.907
Let's start over.

45:03.325 --> 45:04.743
You know Manager Cho, right?

45:09.164 --> 45:10.374
Right

45:10.457 --> 45:11.750
a no

45:11.834 --> 45:14.044
-to declare.
-Bad fucking birth!

45:14.128 --> 45:16.588
-Motherfucker!
-High!

45:16.672 --> 45:18.966
-Bring that down.
-Let go.

45:19.049 --> 45:20.050
Aside.

45:20.592 --> 45:23.011
Good. Let's see how far we can go.

45:23.303 --> 45:24.263
What is your name?

45:24.346 --> 45:27.099
No. What is your last name?

45:29.727 --> 45:32.646
Right not to declare.

45:32.730 --> 45:33.647
Motherfucker!

45:33.731 --> 45:36.233
-High.
-Son of a big whore!

45:36.316 --> 45:37.359
That's what it's called?

45:37.443 --> 45:40.487
Son of a big whore!

45:40.571 --> 45:43.031
Right not to declare? Motherfucker!

45:44.283 --> 45:45.868
Hey, go look...

45:45.951 --> 45:47.619
Where is the fucking whore?

45:48.245 --> 45:51.331
That Wendy, Yankees' girlfriend.
Bring it right now.

45:53.083 --> 45:55.210
Yesterday they sent her to the prosecutor's office.

45:55.294 --> 45:56.920
The Narcotics Division took her.

45:57.296 --> 45:58.672
Why Narcotics?

45:58.756 --> 46:02.050
It seems that she is also accused
of drug manufacturing.

46:02.134 --> 46:03.677
The fucking mother!

46:03.761 --> 46:07.890
It just can't be! What the fuck!

46:09.433 --> 46:12.311
Everything goes wrong, damn it!

46:12.394 --> 46:14.980
-How did it go?
-Won't say anything

46:15.063 --> 46:17.024
and invokes his right not to testify.

46:19.026 --> 46:20.402
Keep watching him.

46:20.486 --> 46:22.237
Yes sir. I will keep you informed.

46:58.857 --> 47:00.400
We decide the delivery date.

47:02.277 --> 47:04.238
-When it will be?
-In two days.

47:09.535 --> 47:10.828
There are chances

47:12.788 --> 47:16.250
to increase imports?

47:17.209 --> 47:19.586
It takes a week
to manufacture the product.

47:21.296 --> 47:24.550
That? Did something happen to Mr. Jung?

47:25.717 --> 47:27.553
No, nothing strange.

47:30.430 --> 47:32.099
The thing is

47:32.766 --> 47:35.686
There is a police officer harassing the boss.

47:36.728 --> 47:40.315
And he thinks it can
impede our business.

47:41.233 --> 47:42.818
He's very sensitive these days.

47:43.151 --> 47:44.152
That does not mean

47:45.195 --> 47:47.197
What could something similar happen to me?

47:49.533 --> 47:50.909
Haeryun.

47:52.786 --> 47:54.663
Don't worry.

47:55.497 --> 47:56.748
I'm here.

47:57.457 --> 47:59.751
If something were wrong,

47:59.835 --> 48:01.545
I would tell you right away.

48:02.170 --> 48:04.923
This way you can return to China for a while
to rest.

48:05.424 --> 48:06.800
But for now,

48:07.843 --> 48:08.927
stay calm

48:10.012 --> 48:11.430
and enjoy your stay in Korea.

48:14.057 --> 48:15.559
You know what I think

48:17.728 --> 48:19.187
when I look at you?

48:23.150 --> 48:24.151
"What a good man

48:25.736 --> 48:26.653
is he".

48:34.077 --> 48:35.370
Thirty kilos.

48:36.580 --> 48:37.706
My father

48:38.957 --> 48:43.045
He had bought extra from his suppliers
in case it was necessary.

48:45.797 --> 48:47.424
I'll give you all that.

48:47.507 --> 48:51.094
I will take care
of transporting the product in good condition.

48:52.346 --> 48:53.555
I promise you.

48:57.684 --> 48:59.353
Take it away.

49:09.947 --> 49:10.948
Lady.

49:11.531 --> 49:12.741
This is good?

49:12.824 --> 49:15.077
Everyone in the town is exhausted.

49:20.749 --> 49:24.211
That's why we gave them a roof!

49:29.758 --> 49:31.885
We must fulfill the quantity
within the deadline.

49:33.053 --> 49:34.346
They are father's orders.

49:40.394 --> 49:41.728
Understood?

49:42.562 --> 49:43.814
Yes ma'am!

49:46.316 --> 49:47.776
What an idiot.

49:51.947 --> 49:53.407
Some will go to Jinpo port,

49:53.490 --> 49:55.033
and the rest, to Pohang.

49:55.701 --> 49:58.662
No matter what happens,
our goal is not to be seen

49:59.371 --> 50:01.957
and take photos for evidence.

50:04.584 --> 50:05.627
Very good.

50:06.461 --> 50:08.630
Make the maximum effort today and tomorrow.

50:09.214 --> 50:12.801
This investigation
can go down in history.

50:13.468 --> 50:15.929
When all this is over,
I'll buy you drinks.

50:18.056 --> 50:19.057
I count on you.

50:19.141 --> 50:20.183
Yes sir!

52:11.920 --> 52:14.381
FISHING BOAT

53:54.856 --> 53:56.358
Heavens.

53:58.818 --> 54:01.196
Gicheul, brother.

54:02.948 --> 54:06.785
I told you that fucking police officer
was going to screw you.

58:39.140 --> 58:41.142
