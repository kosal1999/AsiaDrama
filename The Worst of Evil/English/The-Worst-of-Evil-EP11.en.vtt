00:01.626 --> 00:08.633
THE CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS AND
EVENTS OF THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

00:28.153 --> 00:31.197
TWO DAYS BEFORE

00:32.657 --> 00:33.658
Hey,

00:33.742 --> 00:36.411
can your boss get him back up?

00:37.412 --> 00:39.497
Yes, he feels better.

00:39.581 --> 00:40.999
It would be humiliating

00:41.082 --> 00:43.168
to become impotent over something like that, right?

00:43.251 --> 00:44.252
And.

00:46.087 --> 00:47.088
By the way,

00:47.630 --> 00:50.300
I
saw a girl like that next to Jung Gicheul.

00:50.717 --> 00:51.968
Do you know who she is?

00:52.052 --> 00:54.262
When your gangs fought,

00:54.345 --> 00:55.972
there was supposed to be a girl there.

00:56.389 --> 00:58.808
-Correct.
-Who the hell is that?

00:59.142 --> 01:00.477
Our men say

01:02.187 --> 01:03.480
she is a police officer.

01:03.563 --> 01:05.690
From the SMPA or something.

01:06.858 --> 01:08.151
The SMPA?

01:08.943 --> 01:11.154
Nonsense, you idiots.

01:11.237 --> 01:12.530
No really.

01:12.822 --> 01:14.991
SMPA. Kiss my ass.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.995
Why should I
come all this way?

01:19.079 --> 01:20.497
You could have come to me.

01:20.580 --> 01:21.748
Hey.

01:21.831 --> 01:23.041
I'll keep it short.

01:23.541 --> 01:26.920
Could you check
if this person is with the SMPA?

01:29.422 --> 01:30.423
I know you.

01:31.049 --> 01:32.842
She is the daughter of one.

01:32.926 --> 01:33.927
From whom?

01:34.177 --> 01:36.679
What was the name of the former commissioner?

01:36.763 --> 01:37.764
Yu Dukhoon?

01:37.847 --> 01:39.182
This is his daughter.

01:39.265 --> 01:40.642
-Real?
-Yes.

01:41.267 --> 01:43.186
A well-known police family.

01:43.269 --> 01:45.271
Commissioner Yu's two sons,

01:45.355 --> 01:48.316
his daughter, even the son-in-law.
All police officers.

01:48.399 --> 01:50.902
Son in law? Then she is married.

01:52.153 --> 01:53.279
Or divorced?

01:53.363 --> 01:55.406
In a police family? Never.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.242
What do you say about that?

01:58.201 --> 02:00.453
A married policewoman
and a gangster?

02:00.537 --> 02:01.538
How?

02:01.621 --> 02:03.039
Are you quite sure?

02:03.123 --> 02:04.666
No confusion? That is her?

02:04.749 --> 02:05.750
Look.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.838
Do you want to live here?

02:13.133 --> 02:14.592
This will be our house.

02:16.469 --> 02:18.346
Once this deal is completed,

02:19.597 --> 02:21.266
I'll start over here.

02:21.683 --> 02:22.851
Will you be there?

02:24.060 --> 02:25.061
Gicheul.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.283
Isn't it nice here?

02:38.658 --> 02:39.659
Gicheul.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.495
Because of this deal...

02:44.831 --> 02:45.957
Does it still have to be there?

02:47.250 --> 02:48.835
I have to see it through.

02:48.918 --> 02:50.879
Everything will be fine. No worries.

02:57.135 --> 03:00.138
Junmo, can't you stop here?

03:00.930 --> 03:03.224
If you prevent trade...

03:04.350 --> 03:05.894
If you just stop now,

03:07.187 --> 03:09.480
then nothing will happen to us.

03:10.356 --> 03:11.524
Who is “us”?

03:15.778 --> 03:17.113
Euijeong, is it...

03:25.455 --> 03:26.664
... because of Jung Gicheul?

03:28.416 --> 03:29.667
Junmo.

03:30.585 --> 03:31.711
I can ...

03:34.672 --> 03:35.673
...don't stop here.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.596
I will close this case.

04:17.590 --> 04:24.138
THE WORST OF EVIL

05:27.201 --> 05:28.286
The number is correct.

05:29.912 --> 05:30.913
Let's finish it.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.922
Hello. Did you find out anything?

06:21.005 --> 06:22.465
-Yes.
-The name again?

06:22.548 --> 06:23.633
Officer Park Junmo.

06:23.716 --> 06:26.219
- Park Junmo.
-Ja.

06:26.302 --> 06:28.012
-POLICE CHIEF?
-Yes.

06:28.096 --> 06:29.764
-Next time it's my turn.
-What?

06:29.847 --> 06:30.932
Thanks.

06:32.475 --> 06:33.476
Who is this?

06:33.559 --> 06:34.936
A clueless policeman,

06:35.019 --> 06:37.397
whose wife
cheats on him with a gangster.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.565
"Park Junmo"?

06:39.649 --> 06:41.943
Jung Gicheul, you son of a bitch.

06:42.527 --> 06:46.322
I will have you at any cost

06:47.240 --> 06:49.033
put behind bars.

06:59.961 --> 07:01.337
You have the material.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.506
Good. Stay
close on their heels.

07:07.927 --> 07:08.928
Well done.

07:09.011 --> 07:10.721
I quickly go to the toilet.

07:21.190 --> 07:22.275
WC

07:44.714 --> 07:45.798
We're leaving, sir.

08:29.383 --> 08:33.721
Captain, the black limousine
has been there the whole time.

08:33.804 --> 08:36.307
Don't jump to conclusions.

08:36.390 --> 08:39.227
We arrest the suspects
when they load the boat.

08:51.322 --> 08:52.448
Yongdae, it's me.

08:54.325 --> 08:55.326
Hallo, Boss.

08:55.952 --> 08:57.703
Find out if Chief Seo is in Gangnam.

08:58.412 --> 08:59.413
Yes, boss.

09:05.461 --> 09:08.172
Why are you taking
this all personally?

09:10.758 --> 09:11.926
Because it's dangerous.

09:13.553 --> 09:14.971
That's why I have to do this.

09:15.721 --> 09:17.515
Plus, I started it.

09:19.058 --> 09:22.061
I saw it as the only way
I could live my life

09:22.144 --> 09:24.313
and could change that of my men .

09:25.940 --> 09:28.818
But you keep that a secret from them.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.821
If they knew
drug money paid for their stores,

09:33.364 --> 09:35.199
they would feel guilty.

09:39.161 --> 09:40.329
Seung Ho.

09:43.207 --> 09:44.875
At some point I started

09:46.919 --> 09:48.087
to recognize myself in you.

09:50.339 --> 09:52.550
You pursue your goals

09:53.050 --> 09:54.844
stubborn and unyielding.

09:57.221 --> 09:59.348
That's why I trust you with this.

10:03.936 --> 10:05.229
It will not be easy,

10:06.522 --> 10:08.065
but I wish you luck.

10:09.066 --> 10:10.234
Ok, Sir.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.991
But if it gets too dangerous,

10:19.076 --> 10:20.494
then you have to stop.

10:39.805 --> 10:42.933
By the way, where does
the trading actually take place?

10:50.983 --> 10:52.276
Here.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.402
Port Seven.

10:54.111 --> 10:56.530
Is the dealer Japanese?

10:56.614 --> 10:58.699
A Korean-Japanese skipper.

10:58.783 --> 11:02.244
He speaks Korean fluently,
you can talk to him directly.

12:20.322 --> 12:21.657
He just got out.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.325
Is the car already at the entrance?

12:23.409 --> 12:24.869
I don't see anyone yet.

12:25.494 --> 12:26.787
Shin, look at it.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.831
OK, sir. I'll drive over.

12:48.726 --> 12:49.935
Seung Ho.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.482
Wake up.

12:56.317 --> 12:57.443
Kwon Seungho.

13:26.180 --> 13:28.766
Captain, I think
we missed her.

13:28.849 --> 13:30.267
Crap.

13:30.351 --> 13:31.310
Captain.

13:31.393 --> 13:33.896
A car exploded on the street
near the harbor.

13:33.979 --> 13:35.147
Exploded?

13:36.398 --> 13:38.442
Check it out on site.

13:39.985 --> 13:41.153
Damned.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.199
Come on. Wake up.

13:54.667 --> 13:55.668
Boss.

13:56.585 --> 13:59.213
What just happened?

14:07.221 --> 14:08.222
Boss.

14:09.723 --> 14:12.560
What about our fabric?

14:13.060 --> 14:14.144
He is gone.

14:15.646 --> 14:16.856
Damned.

14:23.571 --> 14:24.947
What's going on here?

14:27.658 --> 14:28.659
What happened?

14:28.742 --> 14:30.035
Are you OK?

14:31.453 --> 14:32.663
Get on.

14:32.746 --> 14:33.747
Kyungjin?

14:34.498 --> 14:36.292
How did he know
you were here?

14:36.375 --> 14:37.960
That must have been Jungbae.

14:38.460 --> 14:39.837
Nobody knows this route,

14:40.296 --> 14:42.172
except him, you and me.

14:42.256 --> 14:44.341
That was 30 kilograms.

14:44.425 --> 14:45.843
These bastards.

14:46.468 --> 14:48.429
I spare them
and they betray me.

14:50.347 --> 14:52.474
-Let's go to the hospital.
-No.

14:52.558 --> 14:53.893
Let's go to Seoul.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.561
Seoul? Why?

14:55.644 --> 14:57.438
We have to find the material first.

14:57.521 --> 14:59.023
Go ahead, go ahead!

15:00.149 --> 15:01.650
Back to Seoul.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.360
And gather the boys.

15:03.444 --> 15:05.738
-What happened?
-I was there.

15:05.821 --> 15:08.157
The exploded car
was our target.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.910
But there was no one inside.

15:12.077 --> 15:13.078
What should we do?

15:15.623 --> 15:17.791
We're retreating
to Seoul for now.

15:19.001 --> 15:20.002
Yes, Captain.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.171
What did he say?

15:22.880 --> 15:24.006
Back to Seoul.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.719
Damned!

15:31.096 --> 15:32.431
What the hell is going on?

15:35.643 --> 15:37.770
Boss, are you okay?

15:37.853 --> 15:40.105
Choi Jungbae and Oh Kyungjin
betrayed us.

15:41.523 --> 15:43.275
- Byungwoo.
-And, Sir?

15:43.359 --> 15:45.778
What is Kyungjin up to today?

15:46.278 --> 15:48.906
I don't know, sir.
He disappeared without a trace.

15:48.989 --> 15:51.617
Search every corner
and find these motherfuckers.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.496
Why are you standing there so stupid?

15:56.163 --> 15:58.999
Come on! Move your asses!

15:59.083 --> 16:00.501
-Yes, sir!
-Let's go.

16:07.841 --> 16:09.969
This is the list of
dealers we know.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.721
We start
grilling them immediately.

16:13.514 --> 16:15.849
Find out by any means possible
whether they have recently

16:16.725 --> 16:18.143
had contact with Jungbae.

16:18.769 --> 16:19.770
Yes, boss.

16:45.421 --> 16:47.214
One day you realize

16:47.297 --> 16:49.466
that you were blind.

16:56.265 --> 16:58.517
All dealers from Gangnam Crystal.

16:58.600 --> 17:01.437
Jung Gicheul has his people
search all of Gangnam,

17:01.520 --> 17:04.606
so I think
they will find Choi Jungbae soon.

17:08.193 --> 17:10.029
When Choi and Oh
were in our gang,

17:10.904 --> 17:13.323
Those were their phone numbers.

17:13.407 --> 17:15.200
Check their call logs.

17:16.160 --> 17:19.872
I made a risky decision
and trusted you.

17:20.456 --> 17:22.416
You disappoint me, Mr. Jung.

17:23.625 --> 17:25.586
This will cause great damage,

17:26.295 --> 17:28.922
not only for me,
but also for you.

17:29.548 --> 17:30.591
I am very sorry.

17:31.967 --> 17:33.719
I will send it to you at any cost.

17:33.802 --> 17:35.012
I'll give you a week.

17:35.679 --> 17:37.598
I can't wait any longer.

17:38.348 --> 17:39.641
I understand.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.268
I will
show no more mercy.

17:45.731 --> 17:46.732
What did he say?

17:46.815 --> 17:47.900
One week.

17:51.528 --> 17:53.280
We really need to find this stuff.

17:53.822 --> 17:54.823
Naturally.

17:55.949 --> 17:59.119
That was our lifelong dream.
Of course we have to find it.

18:00.913 --> 18:01.914
I'll go then.

18:07.711 --> 18:08.879
However, Gicheul...

18:10.172 --> 18:11.548
... to be honest,

18:11.632 --> 18:14.718
I don't see any point in it.
We already own all of Gangnam.

18:15.511 --> 18:16.553
I mean,

18:17.763 --> 18:21.058
Every day there is new trouble
and it becomes more and more dangerous.

18:22.226 --> 18:23.977
The boys express their concerns.

18:24.061 --> 18:26.396
Are you saying
we should give up now?

18:26.480 --> 18:27.773
And?

18:27.856 --> 18:29.775
I'm just saying,
we can sure...

18:29.858 --> 18:31.485
Fuck it safe!

18:39.952 --> 18:41.453
Gut.

18:41.537 --> 18:42.538
I understand.

18:46.083 --> 18:49.878
POLICE OFFICE EUMSEONG
DEPARTMENT FIGHTING CRIME

18:49.962 --> 18:51.505
Definition of province, what?

18:54.716 --> 18:57.010
Good afternoon, gentlemen police officers!

18:57.094 --> 18:58.971
Oh, you're all alone.

18:59.054 --> 19:01.807
Man, you need to clean this place up.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.393
How can I help you?

19:04.476 --> 19:07.896
I am an investigator
with Gangnam Police in Seoul.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.189
Understand.

19:09.273 --> 19:13.026
Is Detective Park Junmo here?

19:13.110 --> 19:14.695
I would like to visit him.

19:15.195 --> 19:16.738
He is currently ill.

19:16.822 --> 19:17.823
Was?

19:17.906 --> 19:18.907
Written in sick?

19:19.658 --> 19:21.785
Is he very sick?

19:22.536 --> 19:25.205
No, I
don't think it's that serious.

19:26.039 --> 19:27.332
What could be going on?

19:28.250 --> 19:31.170
His wife
certainly cooks well for him and everything.

19:33.505 --> 19:36.300
I know trusting me
was a hard decision.

19:37.676 --> 19:39.678
And then
my first trade goes wrong.

19:41.763 --> 19:42.890
I apologize.

19:42.973 --> 19:46.143
At least my judgment of character is
confirmed.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.353
You didn't run away

19:48.979 --> 19:50.606
you told me everything honestly.

19:53.358 --> 19:56.195
Producing the material again is easy,

19:58.989 --> 20:01.575
not finding a trustworthy person .

20:02.618 --> 20:05.746
Haeryun, I will do everything I can
to find the material

20:07.581 --> 20:09.291
and save this trade.

20:14.630 --> 20:16.757
Somehow I'm
always in your debt.

20:17.466 --> 20:18.884
Then pay them.

20:28.101 --> 20:29.102
I trust you.

20:30.687 --> 20:32.940
I know you'll
make everything okay.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.251
Seung Ho.

20:53.460 --> 20:54.544
How depressed you are.

20:56.421 --> 20:58.674
I like you
because you are confident.

21:00.050 --> 21:01.760
Don't burden yourself with everything alone.

21:03.345 --> 21:05.013
Tell me if you need help.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.977
Your worries are mine too.

21:15.899 --> 21:19.820
Your father in China
must be very upset too.

21:20.862 --> 21:21.947
I'm just ...

21:23.156 --> 21:26.285
...worried that I'm
getting you in trouble.

21:26.368 --> 21:28.036
That concerns me.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.038
I do this because I want to.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.498
So don't feel bad.

21:32.207 --> 21:33.208
Thanks.

21:38.714 --> 21:41.174
I like the smell of the water.

21:42.384 --> 21:44.511
I smelled that every morning.

21:46.471 --> 21:48.307
Did you live by a river?

21:49.599 --> 21:51.643
Ja, am Yitong.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.106
In Changchun. It's beautiful there.

21:59.776 --> 22:00.902
Changchun?

22:03.572 --> 22:04.740
And.

22:06.074 --> 22:07.117
It's peaceful there.

22:07.200 --> 22:10.454
Quieter than here.

22:32.976 --> 22:34.436
-Hello?
-It's me.

22:35.228 --> 22:36.521
Hallo, Boss.

22:36.605 --> 22:38.357
Something happened?

22:40.192 --> 22:43.528
Is Haeryun objective
about this boy, Kwon Seungho?

22:47.741 --> 22:50.077
This weak girl
was bound to cause problems.

22:51.787 --> 22:53.747
She has to take responsibility.

22:55.540 --> 22:56.541
Damned!

23:23.985 --> 23:24.986
Haeryun.

23:28.448 --> 23:30.117
Do you want to wait in China?

23:30.659 --> 23:33.537
The situation in Korea
doesn't seem very good.

23:34.746 --> 23:36.373
When looking for the material,

23:37.082 --> 23:38.208
who knows what will happen.

23:38.875 --> 23:39.918
When it's clarified,

23:42.546 --> 23:43.839
we go together.

23:52.222 --> 23:53.223
Let's drive.

24:16.079 --> 24:17.122
Dohyung.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.796
I now know
where the Chinese are.

24:27.841 --> 24:28.925
Changchun, Jilin.

24:29.968 --> 24:32.387
From Korea we know
of their base in Changchun

24:32.471 --> 24:38.059
and questioned the local police about
the Korean-Chinese gangs.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.395
The gang is called Donghobang.

24:41.021 --> 24:42.898
Your boss is Lee Oson.

24:43.815 --> 24:47.110
Our Korean source
has been confirmed

24:47.194 --> 24:50.113
his daughter is Lee Haeryun.

24:50.947 --> 24:53.325
We leave for Changchun immediately.

24:53.992 --> 24:58.413
We locate their drug factory
with the help of the police there

24:58.497 --> 25:03.627
and wait for Korea and Japan
to give us the signal to arrest.

25:03.710 --> 25:04.711
Understood?

25:04.794 --> 25:06.087
Yes, sir!

25:06.171 --> 25:07.547
Good. Listen again.

25:09.841 --> 25:13.136
OK. The Chinese are ready.

25:15.555 --> 25:17.098
All thanks to Detective Park,

25:17.182 --> 25:19.226
who plays with Haeryun's heart.

25:19.309 --> 25:20.393
Sir.

25:20.477 --> 25:22.270
Now let's find Choi Jungbae...

25:23.647 --> 25:27.400
No, let's make the entire investigation public now .

25:29.653 --> 25:30.820
You're joking, right?

25:30.904 --> 25:33.823
Things are getting riskier
for Detective Park.

25:33.907 --> 25:35.408
Officer Yu is also worried.

25:35.492 --> 25:36.910
-And?
-What do you mean by "and"?

25:36.993 --> 25:38.245
Captain!

25:38.995 --> 25:40.121
We are nearly there.

25:41.289 --> 25:44.793
Please keep the focus
until it's over.

25:46.044 --> 25:48.046
-Sir.
-I'm serious.

25:49.047 --> 25:51.091
And calm down Officer Yu.

25:52.175 --> 25:54.636
We cannot reveal
the couple's private feelings

25:54.719 --> 25:56.846
allow the investigation to be compromised.

26:02.769 --> 26:03.770
Welcome back, sir.

26:06.147 --> 26:08.066
Would you like me to drive you to the office, sir?

26:09.442 --> 26:11.486
I wonder
why things keep happening.

26:12.946 --> 26:15.574
Why does shit like this keep happening to us
?

26:17.659 --> 26:18.910
Sir.

26:19.536 --> 26:22.789
The boss told me
to do something first.

26:22.872 --> 26:23.873
Was?

26:23.957 --> 26:26.710
The document is in the glove compartment.

26:38.221 --> 26:40.807
Yongdae, drive me back
to Gangnam Police.

26:41.891 --> 26:43.685
Yes, sir.

26:43.768 --> 26:45.604
SEOUL POLICE DEPARTMENT

26:45.687 --> 26:47.147
I was always with the SMPA,

26:47.230 --> 26:48.773
just not the security department.

26:50.442 --> 26:51.776
Something happened, right?

27:04.372 --> 27:07.959
Guys who used to
work for Jung Gicheul stole the meth.

27:09.669 --> 27:11.254
Then the trade stopped?

27:11.338 --> 27:12.422
How is Junmo?

27:12.505 --> 27:14.215
Junmo is safe and well.

27:14.299 --> 27:17.469
But why did these police officers want
to find Junmo in Eumseong?

27:17.552 --> 27:18.762
What do you mean by that?

27:18.845 --> 27:20.388
Detective Hwang Mingoo.

27:20.472 --> 27:23.183
He was
at Eumseong Police Station yesterday.

27:29.397 --> 27:30.398
Detective Hwang.

27:32.525 --> 27:33.985
I heard you're looking for me.

27:34.611 --> 27:35.612
Who are you?

27:38.782 --> 27:40.992
Park Junmo of Eumseong Police.

27:43.620 --> 27:46.206
Understand. Detective Park Junmo.

27:49.668 --> 27:52.295
I think
I've seen that one before.

27:53.004 --> 27:53.963
Wen?

27:54.047 --> 27:55.048
Maybe not.

27:56.216 --> 27:57.217
Was?

27:57.300 --> 27:58.635
Oh Mann.

27:59.928 --> 28:01.805
Why did you want to see me?

28:02.847 --> 28:05.767
I was told
you were on leave due to illness,

28:05.850 --> 28:08.061
but you seem healthy.

28:08.937 --> 28:10.063
Alongside,

28:10.772 --> 28:15.276
Inspector Yu Euijeong is your wife, right?

28:15.360 --> 28:16.361
Yes. And?

28:16.444 --> 28:18.738
Yu Euijeongs Ehemann, Park Junmo.

28:19.364 --> 28:21.491
Why does he come
and meet Hwang Mingoo here?

28:21.574 --> 28:22.659
Park Junmo?

28:24.577 --> 28:27.414
Is he the husband
of our boss's girlfriend?

28:27.497 --> 28:30.375
Well, I don't even know
where to start.

28:31.668 --> 28:33.336
Did you know,

28:33.420 --> 28:35.797
that your wife is cheating on you?

28:37.507 --> 28:39.384
Of course not.

28:39.467 --> 28:43.138
This handsome boy's name is Jung Gicheul.

28:43.221 --> 28:44.472
A gangster in Gangnam.

28:44.556 --> 28:47.809
The lady next to him
is your wife, right?

28:48.435 --> 28:49.728
Yes. And?

28:50.395 --> 28:53.606
What do you mean by saying,
"Yes, and?"

28:53.690 --> 28:55.191
This is strange.

28:55.275 --> 28:58.653
Your wife is having a good time
with another man.

28:58.737 --> 28:59.821
Doesn't that bother you?

29:00.280 --> 29:02.699
Stay out of
our family matters

29:02.782 --> 29:04.909
and take care of your own.

29:04.993 --> 29:06.870
What? How can you say that?

29:06.953 --> 29:08.955
I'm telling you this for your own good.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.417
My family is my business.

29:12.500 --> 29:13.501
Was?

29:13.585 --> 29:15.253
You still look quite young.

29:15.336 --> 29:16.880
Do you want to retire yet?

29:16.963 --> 29:19.090
How can you talk to me like that?

29:19.174 --> 29:21.593
It makes me sick
to see you playing detective.

29:22.427 --> 29:23.595
I will go now.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.026
Exactly!

29:38.109 --> 29:39.986
I know it again!
I saw him.

29:41.070 --> 29:42.071
Wo?

29:42.155 --> 29:44.407
When I went to get the document
for the boss,

29:44.491 --> 29:45.492
that's when I saw him.

29:45.575 --> 29:46.618
I am certain.

29:46.701 --> 29:48.411
I'm smart.

29:50.371 --> 29:52.207
What the hell is going on here?

29:54.083 --> 29:58.213
We can't find this meth park on the list .

30:00.173 --> 30:01.508
If we don't fix this,

30:02.759 --> 30:04.177
we'll have big problems.

30:04.260 --> 30:07.430
I called his pager.

30:07.514 --> 30:08.848
He will definitely contact us.

30:08.932 --> 30:10.809
What? He contacts us?

30:11.309 --> 30:12.310
You piece of shit.

30:14.103 --> 30:15.438
Come with me.

30:15.522 --> 30:17.565
Come with me, you son of a bitch.

30:17.649 --> 30:21.653
You go now and do
what the fuck you have to do,

30:21.736 --> 30:24.197
and bring me that bastard Meth Park.

30:25.156 --> 30:26.825
-Go get him!
-Seungho.

30:28.076 --> 30:29.327
Can we talk for a moment?

30:34.624 --> 30:36.000
In such times

30:36.084 --> 30:38.336
we have to
keep a cool head.

30:38.920 --> 30:40.922
The lost material was millions...

30:41.005 --> 30:42.882
No, worth billions of won.

30:43.508 --> 30:45.176
That can destroy everything.

30:45.260 --> 30:46.970
We know this!

30:47.053 --> 30:49.764
Our boys are working their
asses off to find him!

30:49.848 --> 30:52.725
Who did they
find with their worked asses?

30:52.809 --> 30:54.644
What did you just say?

30:54.727 --> 30:55.728
Enough.

30:55.812 --> 30:56.813
Say that again.

30:57.522 --> 30:59.399
Moderate yourself.
I'm Hong Heesung.

31:00.316 --> 31:01.442
Hong Heesung.

31:02.485 --> 31:05.738
Check
all our graduates,

31:06.573 --> 31:09.033
whether anyone is in contact
with Jungbae or Kyungjin.

31:09.117 --> 31:10.368
You asshole ...

31:10.451 --> 31:12.036
What are you doing?

31:12.787 --> 31:13.788
Go.

31:16.958 --> 31:18.084
We will talk later.

31:32.807 --> 31:36.728
Boss, I
met Haeryun a few days ago.

31:37.729 --> 31:40.273
Because we lost all the material

31:41.482 --> 31:43.067
and they didn't pay,

31:44.444 --> 31:45.904
They seem to have problems.

31:47.739 --> 31:48.740
It's all gone.

31:49.741 --> 31:50.742
Was?

31:50.825 --> 31:52.660
When we got the material,

31:53.995 --> 31:56.706
Choi Jungbae came to our office
and took everything with him.

31:59.208 --> 32:01.294
Holy shit!

32:01.377 --> 32:04.005
Choi Jungbae, that damn bastard.

32:10.053 --> 32:13.473
Boss, does he have family or relatives?

32:14.599 --> 32:17.393
Shouldn't we take them on?

32:17.477 --> 32:19.395
and find out where he is?

32:20.855 --> 32:22.106
Seung Ho.

32:23.691 --> 32:24.692
Kwon Seungho.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.282
Stay behind the line.

32:37.997 --> 32:38.998
You can go now.

32:57.725 --> 32:58.726
Hallo?

33:02.438 --> 33:04.190
What's up?

33:04.273 --> 33:05.400
Is it urgent?

33:06.734 --> 33:09.153
I said I'll call
when it's all over.

33:09.237 --> 33:11.239
Dohyung told me everything.

33:13.074 --> 33:14.409
Let's meet to talk.

33:20.665 --> 33:22.417
Hello. do you remember me?

33:23.042 --> 33:24.293
And.

33:25.169 --> 33:28.589
The captain of our crime unit
wants to ask a few questions.

33:28.673 --> 33:30.008
He is here in person.

33:30.717 --> 33:32.343
Do you have a moment?

33:33.594 --> 33:36.264
Oh, sure.

33:36.347 --> 33:37.473
This direction, please.

33:40.768 --> 33:42.562
It does not take long.
Get on.

33:50.528 --> 33:51.696
There he is.

33:56.617 --> 34:00.038
These are the communication protocols
of the people on your list.

34:01.247 --> 34:04.542
Jungbae and Kyungjin
haven’t called the number yet.

34:05.918 --> 34:08.880
Here is the address
of Choi Jungbae's parents.

34:11.716 --> 34:14.260
These bastards
need to be in touch,

34:14.343 --> 34:15.344
to sell it.

34:16.304 --> 34:18.473
Dohyoung, check
the logs regularly.

34:20.141 --> 34:21.350
Aside from that,

34:21.434 --> 34:24.645
You could have told me that
on the phone.

34:25.688 --> 34:28.691
You know we don't have time.

34:31.611 --> 34:32.737
I have to go.

34:35.823 --> 34:36.908
Junmo.

34:39.243 --> 34:40.244
What did he say.

34:43.873 --> 34:45.541
Junmo, are you ok?

34:47.585 --> 34:48.586
Am I ok?

34:50.588 --> 34:51.631
Euijeong, you know

34:52.548 --> 34:54.967
what situation
am I in or not?

34:55.968 --> 34:57.136
Do I look okay?

34:59.305 --> 35:00.973
Say if it's too much.
I help ...

35:01.057 --> 35:02.975
Help me with what?

35:04.060 --> 35:06.938
What can you
do about this investigation?

35:09.065 --> 35:11.400
Stop showing up
and distracting me.

35:11.484 --> 35:13.486
Just stay out of here,

35:14.362 --> 35:15.738
if you really want to help.

35:17.240 --> 35:18.407
Junmo...

35:19.992 --> 35:21.119
He said he was a police officer.

35:21.911 --> 35:23.371
He had to exchange the documents.

35:23.454 --> 35:24.455
Damned.

35:25.289 --> 35:29.085
Say it very clearly.
Word by word.

35:30.461 --> 35:32.547
He said he was a drug detective,

35:32.630 --> 35:34.257
so I did as he said.

35:34.799 --> 35:37.385
He said he needed
help with his investigation.

35:38.302 --> 35:39.303
A drug investigator?

35:40.388 --> 35:41.389
Detection?

35:41.472 --> 35:42.557
Park Junmo.

35:42.640 --> 35:44.642
Why have you changed so much?

35:44.725 --> 35:46.561
You are a police officer.
Pull yourself together.

35:46.644 --> 35:47.979
I know that myself!

35:48.062 --> 35:50.022
That's why I'm doing this investigation.

35:50.523 --> 35:51.566
Ok?

35:52.567 --> 35:54.360
Why have I changed so much?

35:55.403 --> 35:58.156
Who pushed me
to this point?

35:59.615 --> 36:03.911
Who
dragged not only me but also Euijeong into this?

36:03.995 --> 36:06.247
Who the fuck was that?

36:07.874 --> 36:10.626
-Junmo, please.
-Who has me mind

36:10.710 --> 36:13.588
and cost someone else their life?

36:15.173 --> 36:17.133
It was you
and fucking Cho Changsik.

36:17.216 --> 36:18.426
Hey.

36:18.509 --> 36:20.303
-Am I not right?
-Junmo.

36:20.386 --> 36:21.429
You know it yourself.

36:21.512 --> 36:23.222
I know how much this bothers you.

36:24.557 --> 36:26.350
But you have to stay strong now.

36:30.938 --> 36:32.190
Junmo.

36:42.158 --> 36:45.077
He's going through a lot right now.

36:45.912 --> 36:47.163
Please understand.

36:54.795 --> 36:56.255
Hello, this is Seok Dohyung.

36:56.339 --> 36:59.425
Hello, detective. Here is
the hall of the police pensioners.

36:59.508 --> 37:01.719
Hello. What is it about?

37:01.802 --> 37:04.639
I should call you
if the person comes back.

37:05.181 --> 37:06.265
He was back?

37:06.682 --> 37:07.683
And.

37:07.767 --> 37:11.145
He asked me to show him the document and others again .

37:11.229 --> 37:12.647
But I wasn't sure.

37:13.773 --> 37:15.775
He'll be back tomorrow morning.

37:15.858 --> 37:18.110
I'll come to you immediately.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.366
He's coming now.

37:24.909 --> 37:26.410
Something happened?

37:26.494 --> 37:30.164
Gangnam Union has become active again.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.042
It's where
private detective Cheon Jinpyung

37:33.125 --> 37:35.294
Junmo's identity was revealed,

37:35.378 --> 37:38.172
and Gangnam Union's people
were back.

37:39.548 --> 37:41.259
I'm going there straight away.

37:41.342 --> 37:44.762
Please keep an eye on Jung Gicheul.

37:46.764 --> 37:47.765
Dohyung.

37:51.018 --> 37:52.019
Be careful.

37:55.106 --> 37:56.107
You too.

37:57.400 --> 37:58.359
Excuse me, sir,

37:58.442 --> 37:59.652
Chief Seo?

38:00.194 --> 38:02.321
Shouldn't we report this to the boss?

38:02.989 --> 38:06.701
We can do that
once we confirm it.

38:10.788 --> 38:14.709
But is it okay
to meet police officers so personally?

38:15.668 --> 38:16.752
What's up with them?

38:18.212 --> 38:19.213
Are they different?

38:20.298 --> 38:21.382
No, sir.

38:22.466 --> 38:24.552
If you stab them,
they die like us.

38:37.940 --> 38:38.941
Hey, Euijeong.

38:44.363 --> 38:47.199
-Hello.
-Oh, hi.

38:47.283 --> 38:49.118
-You'll definitely pass this time.
-Thanks.

38:49.201 --> 38:51.495
-Good luck!
-Thanks.

38:51.579 --> 38:54.081
My goodness, he must be
working really hard.

38:55.791 --> 38:58.085
RELATIONSHIP
SON: CHOI JUNGBAE

39:06.385 --> 39:07.386
Hallo?

39:07.470 --> 39:08.471
Hey, it's me.

39:08.554 --> 39:10.389
Chief Seo, are you on your way?

39:10.473 --> 39:11.515
Where are they?

39:11.932 --> 39:14.226
We have
a fucking emergency at the office.

39:14.310 --> 39:15.770
Choi Jungbae, that bastard...

39:16.896 --> 39:18.272
Let's meet to talk.

39:19.106 --> 39:21.067
I have to catch a rat first.

39:21.567 --> 39:23.235
Come here. And alone.

39:23.903 --> 39:24.862
Was?

39:25.696 --> 39:27.281
What are you talking about?

39:28.115 --> 39:29.158
Write that down.

39:30.701 --> 39:34.538
It is in 361-5, Nokbeon-dong,
Eunpyeong-gu.

39:34.955 --> 39:37.208
Nokbeon dong? Where is that?

39:39.001 --> 39:40.378
Hall of police pensioners.

39:41.295 --> 39:42.421
Come now.

39:49.929 --> 39:50.971
Fuck.

39:59.730 --> 40:00.731
Gicheul.

40:01.982 --> 40:03.692
Do you remember how you said

40:04.193 --> 40:05.945
when someone visits Gangnam,

40:06.028 --> 40:08.948
that they had to come to one of your stores
?

40:10.408 --> 40:12.076
Your dream has come true, right?

40:15.371 --> 40:19.375
Couldn't you stop
what you're doing now?

40:20.584 --> 40:21.752
It's too dangerous.

40:24.338 --> 40:27.967
Euijeong, my dream
hasn't quite come true yet.

40:30.302 --> 40:32.471
I said
I would be the "Emperor of the Night",

40:33.848 --> 40:36.308
and that I would marry you.

40:38.686 --> 40:40.521
Man, that was really cheesy.

40:42.523 --> 40:45.443
You're right.
I could stop now.

40:47.403 --> 40:49.363
But I'm so close to the goal now,

40:50.072 --> 40:51.532
it would be a shame to give up.

40:56.162 --> 40:57.329
Do not worry.

40:58.247 --> 40:59.331
I'll take care of everything.

41:03.210 --> 41:04.211
One second.

41:06.505 --> 41:08.924
-Hello?
-They caught Choi Jungbae.

41:09.008 --> 41:12.303
-What? Where?
-Our boys will take him to the office.

41:12.386 --> 41:13.804
Okay, I'll be there soon.

41:14.972 --> 41:16.474
Sorry, Euijeong, I have to go.

41:16.557 --> 41:17.558
What's up?

41:17.641 --> 41:19.018
I'll explain later. Sorry.

42:16.325 --> 42:17.326
Crap.

42:29.296 --> 42:30.381
Detective Park Junmo.

42:34.260 --> 42:36.011
Yu Euijeong's husband, right?

42:42.601 --> 42:44.937
Why are you following us
like a rat?

42:49.316 --> 42:50.484
Seo Jongryeol?

42:54.530 --> 42:55.948
So you know me.

43:35.404 --> 43:36.405
Hey.

43:37.323 --> 43:39.450
"Hightech-Industriebezirk."

43:42.119 --> 43:44.288
"New airport in Yeongjongdo."

43:46.874 --> 43:49.418
"International Business
and Residential District."

43:50.085 --> 43:51.795
"Sports facilities."

43:54.882 --> 43:56.425
"Entertainment
and tourism complex."

43:57.468 --> 43:59.386
"Maritimer Tourismuskomplex."

44:06.018 --> 44:07.019
Sir.

44:07.853 --> 44:09.229
Where is Chief Seo?

44:09.313 --> 44:11.106
Hey, I found the cop,

44:11.190 --> 44:13.609
who followed us and had us in his sights.

44:14.234 --> 44:15.819
-I found him.
-Who is this?

44:15.903 --> 44:17.946
The boss's girlfriend's husband.

44:19.031 --> 44:20.366
-Open up.
-What?

44:20.449 --> 44:21.659
Open the fucking door!

44:25.454 --> 44:26.580
What should I do?

44:26.664 --> 44:27.873
Until I call you,

44:28.666 --> 44:29.958
-hide somewhere.
-What?

44:30.042 --> 44:32.461
The guy in there is a cop,
so hide!

45:18.549 --> 45:19.925
Crap.

45:31.186 --> 45:32.980
You motherfucker.

45:38.402 --> 45:40.028
Damned.

45:44.742 --> 45:45.743
Hey.

45:49.163 --> 45:51.707
Chief, was ...

45:53.751 --> 45:55.878
What's going on here?

46:06.972 --> 46:07.973
Park Junmo.

46:09.850 --> 46:11.393
Boss's girlfriend's husband.

46:12.144 --> 46:13.145
You know him, right?

46:14.104 --> 46:16.190
You said you know Yu Euijeong.

46:17.399 --> 46:18.901
Then you also know your husband.

46:22.321 --> 46:23.238
Or not?

46:23.614 --> 46:25.282
Yes, I know him.

46:26.325 --> 46:28.410
But he's a police officer.

46:28.494 --> 46:31.288
I thought
Yu Euijeong and her husband

46:32.706 --> 46:34.917
had a plan
to catch us.

46:35.584 --> 46:36.710
I thought that.

46:38.212 --> 46:40.297
But there was more
to this shit.

46:46.804 --> 46:50.265
Seok Dohyung
from the SMPA Drug Squad.

46:54.686 --> 46:58.273
Why did he pretend
to be Park Junmo?

47:00.734 --> 47:01.735
Hey.

47:03.987 --> 47:05.948
You know something about it, right?

47:13.705 --> 47:14.706
Well, maybe not.

47:18.669 --> 47:20.462
Then we can just ask him.

47:22.256 --> 47:23.757
He had this with him.

47:24.675 --> 47:25.843
Because he's a police officer.

47:28.804 --> 47:30.180
Wait, Chief.

47:30.264 --> 47:31.265
Damned.

47:32.266 --> 47:36.728
If we
kill a police officer in the current situation,

47:37.437 --> 47:39.898
Everything gets even more complicated.

47:40.607 --> 47:42.276
Let's find another way.

47:58.292 --> 48:00.043
I'll make it easy.

48:06.133 --> 48:07.134
They finish it.

48:09.928 --> 48:10.929
Listen, Kwon Seungho.

48:14.099 --> 48:15.517
I don't want to doubt you.

48:17.269 --> 48:18.353
Was ...

48:20.856 --> 48:21.940
Chief,

48:23.066 --> 48:24.568
Do you now have...

48:26.737 --> 48:27.905
... suspect me?

48:31.867 --> 48:35.996
My gut feeling is one of us
is in cahoots with the cops.

48:39.207 --> 48:40.459
Let's see who's right.

48:42.419 --> 48:43.420
Stab him.

48:45.130 --> 48:46.256
What the ...

48:50.052 --> 48:51.136
Stab him.

48:58.393 --> 49:00.103
Stab him, you bastard!

49:04.149 --> 49:05.484
Damned.

53:12.772 --> 53:14.774
