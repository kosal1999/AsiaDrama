(The characters, locations,
organizations and events in the play are purely fictitious)

00:10.927 --> 00:14.264
(China Donghao Gang's Nest)

00:19.019 --> 00:20.562
Do you like Korean food?

00:21.855 --> 00:23.148
When are you coming back?

00:23.648 --> 00:25.191
Why is it longer than expected?

00:25.692 --> 00:27.819
Dad, there are so many fun things here

00:28.361 --> 00:30.697
Can I stay longer and observe these two groups?

00:30.780 --> 00:31.865
sure

00:31.948 --> 00:35.118
Whether it's gold or tin, you have to weigh it to see if it's gold or iron.

00:36.077 --> 00:37.579
this kind of discovery

00:37.662 --> 00:39.330
There must be a way to spend time with others

00:43.418 --> 00:44.753
Useless mess

00:45.378 --> 00:46.379
sorry

00:49.883 --> 00:53.553
Hae Ryeon must be having a great time in Seoul

00:56.765 --> 00:58.475
Korean connector

00:59.184 --> 01:00.393
Have you decided on a good candidate?

01:03.104 --> 01:04.064
Zheng Qitie

01:05.315 --> 01:07.567
We show him mercy

01:07.650 --> 01:09.778
Let him get rich off our trust.

01:12.781 --> 01:15.325
So he has to pay for screwing up the deal.

01:18.453 --> 01:19.621
-Jinhua
-in

01:20.205 --> 01:21.372
Serve some tea for brother

01:21.915 --> 01:22.916
yes

01:51.444 --> 01:52.445
Toast

01:59.244 --> 02:02.372
This is dad's flesh and blood

02:03.081 --> 02:04.374
The sweat of brothers

02:05.708 --> 02:07.252
Drink it all in one gulp

02:09.212 --> 02:11.381
We are a family connected by flesh and blood

02:11.881 --> 02:14.300
If you abandon this place

02:15.593 --> 02:17.053
The family should be exterminated

02:17.846 --> 02:19.264
obey

02:19.347 --> 02:20.682
obey

02:37.949 --> 02:43.329
"Evil of Evils"

02:48.209 --> 02:49.711
Hooligan hospitality

02:51.004 --> 02:53.006
what did she say?

02:55.300 --> 02:56.467
correct

02:56.551 --> 02:59.637
Your father and the Japanese boss

02:59.721 --> 03:02.473
They are all characters worthy of writing a book to record their lives.

03:02.557 --> 03:05.268
I really don't understand

03:05.351 --> 03:08.146
Why do those big shots talk to Zheng Qitie?

03:08.229 --> 03:10.064
This kind of cooperation

03:10.148 --> 03:11.816
30 million per kilogram

03:11.900 --> 03:12.942
ten kilograms

03:13.735 --> 03:15.069
Are you willing to accept this deal?

03:16.196 --> 03:19.240
I don't usually deal in drugs

03:22.243 --> 03:23.828
Okay, 20 million per kilogram

03:24.871 --> 03:26.748
I was just speaking Korean, right?

03:27.248 --> 03:28.583
twenty-five million

03:30.585 --> 03:34.047
Miss, how dare you look me in the eyes?

03:35.048 --> 03:37.425
- Funan
- Yes

03:37.508 --> 03:39.928
Can our country accept this kind of etiquette?

03:40.553 --> 03:43.640
Her father probably deserves a book of his own
, but he didn't teach her good manners.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.559
You are so greedy for money

03:46.643 --> 03:48.770
Love of money is an incurable disease

03:49.812 --> 03:50.980
Do you want me to go to the pharmacy?

03:51.064 --> 03:53.483
Go buy some medicine for her

04:23.763 --> 04:26.432
Am I now in business with a mom-and-pop grocery store?

04:29.435 --> 04:31.688
Don't know what's good or bad

04:33.481 --> 04:34.857
It's also a disease

04:38.611 --> 04:40.405
Okay, thirty million

04:40.488 --> 04:42.949
Thirty million is thirty million, okay?

04:46.828 --> 04:48.997
We need to get rid of Zheng Qitie

04:49.622 --> 04:51.833
He won't let us cut off his financial resources

04:51.916 --> 04:54.669
We must take advantage of him first and get rid of him

04:57.005 --> 04:59.382
This is what he owes me too

04:59.966 --> 05:03.094
you want to cause a ruckus

05:03.177 --> 05:04.512
Do you want everyone to know you are selling drugs?

05:06.681 --> 05:08.850
Drug trafficking in China is punishable by death

05:10.351 --> 05:13.146
My father told me to keep a low profile and have fun

05:16.274 --> 05:17.275
but this place

05:19.819 --> 05:21.237
too noisy

05:27.160 --> 05:28.244
help me

05:36.336 --> 05:39.964
(Superintendent Park Joon-mo)

05:57.899 --> 05:58.983
Damn it

06:04.489 --> 06:08.534
Please press one to page and press two to leave a message.

06:11.454 --> 06:12.789
I am Zheng Qitie

06:13.373 --> 06:14.707
You can't even get through on the phone

06:15.500 --> 06:17.001
I'll wait for your call

06:24.509 --> 06:26.219
He asked someone to investigate Yi Zhen

06:26.594 --> 06:28.262
hateful

06:30.014 --> 06:33.393
Did Zheng Qitie discover something?

06:33.476 --> 06:35.812
I checked Qian Zhenping's communication records

06:36.521 --> 06:39.273
He did not speak to Zheng Qitie before the accident

06:39.357 --> 06:40.274
(communication record)

06:40.358 --> 06:42.527
Zheng Qitie didn’t know about this

06:43.069 --> 06:45.696
That means our investigation is going well.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.198
If the investigation goes well

06:47.281 --> 06:50.493
How could Qian Zhenping find out about us?

06:50.576 --> 06:53.621
Yi Zhen and I might have died a long time ago!

06:53.704 --> 06:55.581
Toshisue, calm down!

06:56.833 --> 06:58.126
- it's my fault
- damn

07:01.212 --> 07:02.046
hateful

07:02.547 --> 07:05.967
We really didn't know he would go that far.

07:06.968 --> 07:10.847
But if he confirms his suspicions

07:10.930 --> 07:13.057
I won’t let Yi Zhen go like this

07:13.850 --> 07:17.979
Fortunately, you made a decisive decision

07:18.354 --> 07:20.440
If he were to inform Zheng Qitie,

07:20.523 --> 07:22.859
We had to interrupt the investigation

07:49.135 --> 07:50.261
Who are you?

07:50.636 --> 07:52.096
I am Mr. Qian’s client

07:52.180 --> 07:54.682
We received a report that Mr. Qian had an accident.

07:54.765 --> 07:55.975
What accident?

07:56.309 --> 07:59.020
He fell to his death

08:05.151 --> 08:06.152
boss

08:07.195 --> 08:08.863
I received a call from Li Hailian

08:09.530 --> 08:11.449
She wants to see me tomorrow

08:12.158 --> 08:16.537
I will find a way to negotiate a deal with the Chinese

08:18.664 --> 08:20.708
What did Zhengpei ask you to check?

08:20.791 --> 08:22.835
Check if Liu Yizhen has lived in Wonju

08:22.919 --> 08:25.755
Did Quan Chenghao go to the same school?

08:25.838 --> 08:27.381
- is it her neighbor
- and

08:28.799 --> 08:30.009
The Chinese and Japanese side

08:30.635 --> 08:33.638
It is possible to find a new Korean connector

08:36.015 --> 08:38.184
We should pay attention to the Japanese

08:41.062 --> 08:42.772
See if they make any moves

08:43.523 --> 08:44.607
Chenghao

08:44.690 --> 08:45.525
yes

08:46.150 --> 08:48.528
You seem to care more about this deal than I do

08:57.328 --> 08:58.454
boss

08:58.829 --> 09:00.706
Remember what I told you before?

09:03.793 --> 09:05.253
I want to succeed

09:06.003 --> 09:07.004
the deal

09:08.089 --> 09:09.674
I will be more active

09:09.757 --> 09:13.302
Don't worry, trust me

09:14.011 --> 09:15.513
I will handle it

09:18.099 --> 09:20.810
Qian Zhenping is Zheng Qitie’s accomplice

09:20.893 --> 09:22.812
Therefore he is also the target of our investigation

09:22.895 --> 09:25.690
Do you mean that he was related to Zheng Qitie,
so he deserved his death?

09:26.399 --> 09:28.776
Detective Park’s identity was almost exposed

09:30.152 --> 09:34.448
Anyway, he saw someone die.

09:34.532 --> 09:36.158
Must be in shock

09:36.242 --> 09:39.328
Please call him often to keep him focused

09:39.870 --> 09:41.163
until the end of the task

09:41.247 --> 09:44.250
Sir, this can't be solved with a phone call.

09:44.333 --> 09:46.586
After you put him in danger

09:46.669 --> 09:48.170
Do you still expect that everything will be over with just a few words of comfort?

09:48.879 --> 09:52.675
What Junmo needs now is more police support.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.468
Do you think I don't know?

09:54.552 --> 09:56.554
So how can you let him fight alone?

09:56.637 --> 09:59.473
Undercover operations cannot be conducted as a team!

10:11.485 --> 10:12.486
Hello

10:12.778 --> 10:14.113
It's me, Qitie

10:14.196 --> 10:15.448
Yizhen

10:16.866 --> 10:19.994
Why are you calling so late? What happened?

10:20.077 --> 10:22.038
I want to know if you got home safely

10:24.415 --> 10:25.750
Will you be free tomorrow?

10:25.833 --> 10:27.043
tomorrow?

10:27.126 --> 10:28.461
I take a day off tomorrow

10:30.254 --> 10:31.797
I'm free

10:33.841 --> 10:35.009
Want to come out and meet?

10:36.927 --> 10:38.220
that…

10:38.929 --> 10:41.849
You seem to have a lot to say

10:42.183 --> 10:45.353
I just think that I feel a little sorry

10:46.771 --> 10:48.105
great, see you tomorrow

10:48.939 --> 10:49.940
Oh well

10:51.233 --> 10:52.568
Let's talk tomorrow

11:03.579 --> 11:05.998
It's you who hangs out with the police, not me

11:06.582 --> 11:08.709
There have been strange things going on in our meeting

11:08.793 --> 11:10.419
You didn't even doubt him

11:17.635 --> 11:18.886
Hello

11:18.969 --> 11:20.096
Long Da, it’s me

11:21.013 --> 11:21.847
boss

11:21.931 --> 11:24.767
Come to my office tomorrow morning and don't tell anyone

11:25.685 --> 11:26.852
Yes, boss

11:48.082 --> 11:49.333
Boss, what are you doing?

11:50.543 --> 11:51.919
There are guests today

11:52.712 --> 11:53.921
The office is dirty

11:54.922 --> 11:55.965
guest?

11:56.048 --> 11:58.676
-Give me the broom and I'll sweep it
. -No, I've finished sweeping it.

11:59.093 --> 12:00.469
Go and get ready

12:00.553 --> 12:02.304
Aren’t you going to see Li Hailian today?

12:02.388 --> 12:03.472
Yes, boss

12:03.556 --> 12:05.891
Must make a deal

12:05.975 --> 12:06.976
yes

12:10.563 --> 12:11.564
correct

12:14.942 --> 12:15.943
Wear that suit

12:16.402 --> 12:17.486
What's this?

12:22.408 --> 12:23.409
Thanks

12:28.581 --> 12:29.623
you said before

12:31.417 --> 12:32.918
won't let me down

12:33.919 --> 12:35.129
I really hope not

12:36.589 --> 12:37.590
I can't, boss

12:51.479 --> 12:54.231
you are handsome today

12:55.149 --> 12:56.484
Thanks

12:56.567 --> 12:57.568
Mr. Zheng is not bad either.

12:58.652 --> 12:59.653
you look good

13:00.446 --> 13:01.489
Are you coming alone?

13:01.572 --> 13:04.200
Yes, it's a date after all

13:04.658 --> 13:05.910
- Let's go?
-good

13:09.205 --> 13:11.040
Qitie, are you waiting for me?

13:12.625 --> 13:13.626
You came

13:14.794 --> 13:15.795
Hello

13:16.462 --> 13:18.130
Chenghao, do you want to go out?

13:18.923 --> 13:20.090
right

13:20.174 --> 13:22.593
Why are you here?

13:24.720 --> 13:26.847
Open the door, this is our first date

13:27.848 --> 13:28.849
good

13:35.189 --> 13:37.149
I wish you both a happy date

13:37.233 --> 13:39.068
Have fun, call me if you need anything

13:39.652 --> 13:40.653
I will, boss

13:44.740 --> 13:45.950
- let's go
- okay

13:50.621 --> 13:52.081
Mr. Zheng’s girlfriend?

13:52.706 --> 13:55.125
Where do you want to go today?

14:00.756 --> 14:04.468
Who is the lady next to Chenghao?

14:04.969 --> 14:07.596
is our client, she runs a liquor business

14:08.097 --> 14:11.308
That's it, it turns out we're talking about business

14:14.228 --> 14:15.312
She likes Chenghao

14:18.482 --> 14:19.483
how do you know?

14:20.234 --> 14:22.236
Really like someone

14:23.571 --> 14:24.572
I can tell

14:29.034 --> 14:30.035
bring it on

14:41.881 --> 14:43.757
This is where my employees work

14:45.050 --> 14:46.927
There's a sofa there

14:47.011 --> 14:49.138
There are also sports fitness equipment

14:54.602 --> 14:56.353
Do you live here?

14:56.437 --> 14:58.147
No, this is where Chenghao lives.

15:05.446 --> 15:06.864
- Yi Zhen
- What?

15:08.490 --> 15:09.700
-Come here
-Okay

15:13.537 --> 15:15.456
this is my office

15:17.708 --> 15:18.709
Please sit down

15:18.792 --> 15:19.960
good

15:28.969 --> 15:30.054
how do you feel?

15:31.138 --> 15:32.264
not bad

15:32.348 --> 15:33.432
Want something to drink?

15:35.100 --> 15:36.268
Hello boss

15:36.352 --> 15:38.479
Pei Longda reports in

15:39.605 --> 15:40.606
Wait a moment

15:43.859 --> 15:44.944
follow me

15:45.027 --> 15:46.028
yes

15:50.407 --> 15:51.659
Who is that person outside?

15:52.034 --> 15:53.410
none of your business

15:54.119 --> 15:55.120
Longda

15:56.372 --> 15:58.123
I'm going to give you a job

15:58.207 --> 15:59.208
Can you?

16:01.168 --> 16:02.127
yes

16:02.211 --> 16:03.712
I will do it properly

16:04.546 --> 16:05.506
good

16:06.048 --> 16:06.924
Got it, boss

16:52.761 --> 16:55.222
Sorry, I asked him to do something

16:55.305 --> 16:57.224
Am I disturbing your business?

16:57.683 --> 16:59.018
No, I'm not busy

17:00.394 --> 17:03.355
It's a pleasure every time I meet you

17:05.607 --> 17:07.818
What are we going to do today?

17:12.281 --> 17:16.160
Today is your rare day off.
I want to take you to a place

17:16.243 --> 17:17.244
OK?

17:18.454 --> 17:19.997
good

17:20.664 --> 17:21.498
caught you

17:26.420 --> 17:30.215
There are so many great places in Seoul,
why come here?

17:30.924 --> 17:32.760
I want to invest in land

17:33.761 --> 17:35.596
I heard that this area needs to be updated

17:37.264 --> 17:42.269
This place is shabbier than where I lived when I was a kid

17:45.981 --> 17:48.525
I grew up in a place like this

17:49.443 --> 17:50.652
I've long been used to it

17:51.862 --> 17:52.780
That's it

17:52.863 --> 17:54.198
It is said that

17:54.948 --> 17:57.659
Mr. Zheng had a very hard childhood just like me.

17:57.743 --> 18:00.037
Some people are desperate for dangerous business

18:00.120 --> 18:02.164
There must be some reason

18:03.707 --> 18:06.001
What games did you play when you were a kid?

18:06.085 --> 18:07.086
me?

18:08.545 --> 18:10.089
Why do you ask this suddenly?

18:10.631 --> 18:13.342
"If you want to know a person, you must predict his events."

18:15.636 --> 18:16.929
This is a Chinese proverb

18:18.013 --> 18:21.767
To understand a person, you must first know his past

18:22.726 --> 18:25.354
I want to know your childhood life

18:30.943 --> 18:33.153
(Pun sugar, 300 won)

18:35.072 --> 18:37.908
Now use a toothpick

18:37.991 --> 18:39.201
or needle

18:40.327 --> 18:42.579
Successfully poke the pattern along the lines

18:42.663 --> 18:43.872
will get another piece

18:44.832 --> 18:45.791
Get another slice?

18:46.333 --> 18:48.335
Did you play with candy canes when you were a kid?

18:52.756 --> 18:56.093
In this way, the film will be considered a failure.

19:04.601 --> 19:05.811
So dirty

19:05.894 --> 19:08.230
(Please do not enter during investigation)

19:14.903 --> 19:18.073
"International Free City, Tourism and Entertainment Special Zone"

19:20.367 --> 19:23.453
I've been trying to get development rights

19:24.204 --> 19:26.206
We're about to sign a contract

19:27.374 --> 19:30.878
I don’t want my childhood dreams to stay in Jiangnan

19:38.719 --> 19:41.889
Can you imagine there are restaurants here?

19:41.972 --> 19:45.184
Casinos, pools and amusement parks?

19:47.102 --> 19:49.521
There is also the successful entrepreneur Zheng Qitie

19:52.816 --> 19:54.151
And you are by my side

20:00.824 --> 20:03.076
I didn't know you were doing this too

20:04.411 --> 20:06.330
Hope it goes well

20:08.332 --> 20:10.167
So what do you think I'm doing?

20:21.261 --> 20:22.846
I want to tell you the truth

20:24.223 --> 20:25.641
I hope you can be honest with me too

20:31.521 --> 20:33.023
I will not lie to you

20:57.714 --> 20:58.715
Are you busy?

21:00.467 --> 21:02.135
not busy

21:02.636 --> 21:03.929
People…

21:05.597 --> 21:07.099
a little angry

21:07.516 --> 21:08.767
sorry

21:14.231 --> 21:15.232
Did I poke well?

21:16.692 --> 21:17.693
right

21:18.694 --> 21:19.945
That pattern is difficult

21:32.082 --> 21:33.250
The chunk is mine

21:37.546 --> 21:42.009
Sorry, what does this brand say?

21:42.551 --> 21:45.512
"Police Friends Club, Local Police Friends Club, Police Friends News"

21:47.097 --> 21:49.808
Police Alumni Club, Xinbao…

21:50.976 --> 21:51.810
police friend

21:52.519 --> 21:55.522
Brother, wait, where is this place?

21:56.398 --> 21:58.233
Looks like a retired police club

21:58.317 --> 21:59.860
Police

22:01.778 --> 22:02.779
Thank you bro

22:03.822 --> 22:05.657
Why do you keep calling me brother?

22:05.949 --> 22:08.785
Anyone who knows more than me deserves to be called big brother

22:28.805 --> 22:29.723
Wait a moment

22:36.772 --> 22:37.939
OK, tell me

22:38.148 --> 22:40.650
I went to Enping Police Station to ask

22:40.734 --> 22:43.445
They said the man accidentally fell from the top floor

22:43.528 --> 22:44.821
Accident?

22:44.905 --> 22:46.156
What was he doing on the top floor?

22:46.865 --> 22:50.035
that…

22:50.118 --> 22:51.703
I am not sure

22:52.329 --> 22:53.413
Where is his cell phone?

22:53.497 --> 22:55.707
He doesn't have a cell phone on him, just his wallet

22:56.291 --> 22:57.292
no mobile phone?

22:57.376 --> 23:00.087
I asked twice and they both said they didn't have a mobile phone

23:00.670 --> 23:02.005
And you tell me

23:02.089 --> 23:04.800
What’s so special about Chalufen Cave?

23:04.883 --> 23:08.220
There is a community service center and a casino here

23:08.804 --> 23:11.807
There is also a place called the Police Friends Club.

23:11.890 --> 23:15.310
- Police Friends Club?
-Yes, it seems to be some kind of police club.

23:19.356 --> 23:21.274
Listen carefully and do as I say

23:33.620 --> 23:34.621
What's the matter?

23:38.500 --> 23:40.127
I'm from Gangnam Police Station

23:44.756 --> 23:45.924
Qitie

23:46.967 --> 23:49.261
When my mother passed away

23:50.512 --> 23:52.681
And during my mother's farewell ceremony

23:53.140 --> 23:56.435
I found that you really care about me

23:59.604 --> 24:00.939
you sure?

24:02.441 --> 24:03.567
What's the meaning?

24:07.362 --> 24:09.114
Have you ever lived in Wonju?

24:13.535 --> 24:15.370
I have never lived in Wonju

24:16.538 --> 24:18.123
But I go there very often

24:18.874 --> 24:20.917
my father used to work there

24:24.546 --> 24:28.341
My mother has been sick for a long time

24:29.176 --> 24:32.179
She has to go to Seoul Hospital for regular check-ups

24:33.305 --> 24:36.099
My parents had to live separately

24:36.892 --> 24:41.688
So I often travel between Seoul and Wonju

24:44.566 --> 24:47.569
How do you know I lived in Wonju?

24:48.820 --> 24:50.947
I never told you

24:51.740 --> 24:53.241
Chenghao told me

24:55.035 --> 24:57.162
He said you two were very close when you were little.

24:57.245 --> 24:59.289
Then you moved to Seoul when you were in middle school

25:01.416 --> 25:02.918
But the church people

25:03.418 --> 25:05.795
I seem to remember you when you were in elementary school

25:07.255 --> 25:08.924
I feel strange

25:09.591 --> 25:11.593
I moved back when I was in elementary school

25:13.220 --> 25:16.223
Chenghao must have remembered something that happened so long ago.

25:19.935 --> 25:24.648
Will that affect our relationship?

25:39.621 --> 25:40.622
how?

25:40.705 --> 25:42.958
I got the documents, boss.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.126
The lady ignored me at first

25:45.210 --> 25:48.505
I had to resort to the tricks I used to pretend to be cute when I was little

25:49.297 --> 25:53.134
Anyway, the documents Qian Zhenping got yesterday

25:53.593 --> 25:56.388
I got a copy

25:56.846 --> 25:58.223
Do you want me to read it to you?

25:58.306 --> 26:00.267
- OK
- wait a minute

26:02.561 --> 26:04.729
"Liu Dexun, experience"

26:12.445 --> 26:13.446
Okay, thank you

26:27.586 --> 26:28.587
Yizhen

26:29.963 --> 26:31.423
Could you please turn around?

27:28.480 --> 27:29.981
I'm sorry if I offended you.

27:30.190 --> 27:31.775
Just a misunderstanding

27:33.943 --> 27:35.236
this necklace

27:36.029 --> 27:37.781
It's a promise I made in high school

27:38.657 --> 27:40.492
I said I would give you something better

27:49.542 --> 27:50.835
The sea breeze is very cold

27:52.045 --> 27:53.588
Get back in the car

27:57.300 --> 28:01.554
"Address, No. 512-9, Bongsan-dong, Wonju"

28:02.972 --> 28:04.224
interesting

28:19.322 --> 28:20.657
What's the matter?

28:27.122 --> 28:28.748
you are pretty

28:33.878 --> 28:35.171
What did you say?

28:35.672 --> 28:37.173
sorry

28:38.842 --> 28:42.053
Okay, Pei Longda, "You can't be beaten to death when the doomsday comes."

28:42.554 --> 28:43.972
give it a try

28:45.974 --> 28:47.809
Thank you for your cooperation

28:48.476 --> 28:52.313
That person or someone else wants to ask for information

28:52.772 --> 28:54.524
Notify me

28:54.607 --> 28:55.817
I will

29:16.546 --> 29:17.464
that…

29:18.465 --> 29:20.008
Is he your boyfriend?

29:21.885 --> 29:22.969
Isn't it?

29:23.595 --> 29:24.721
no

29:27.140 --> 29:30.268
The flower shop had the last bunch of flowers left, so I bought them on the way.

29:31.352 --> 29:32.937
-Give it to me?
-right

29:33.229 --> 29:34.272
- Please accept it
- Okay

29:34.355 --> 29:35.356
Senior
Senior

29:36.149 --> 29:37.942
-Senior
-What are you doing?

29:40.111 --> 29:42.238
You know that Mr. Qian Zhenping, right?

29:42.739 --> 29:43.740
He died yesterday

29:44.574 --> 29:45.658
Who is that?

29:45.742 --> 29:47.827
He used to be a subordinate of the Namdaemun Police Chief.

29:48.661 --> 29:51.873
The one who was fired for accepting bribes and changed his career to become a private detective

29:51.956 --> 29:53.541
I caught him forging documents last year

29:54.000 --> 29:54.959
How is he?

29:55.043 --> 29:58.922
Did you know that he works for Zheng Qitie’s Jiangnan Society?

30:16.272 --> 30:17.524
Where did he die? How to die?

30:19.859 --> 30:23.530
I couldn't play like this when I was a kid

30:24.030 --> 30:26.741
You know that arrogant guy who follows me around all the time, right?

30:27.617 --> 30:29.869
He never leaves

30:29.953 --> 30:31.538
I don't even have any friends

30:32.872 --> 30:35.667
Can you imagine how frustrating this must be for a child
?

30:37.669 --> 30:38.837
Do you understand now?

30:39.629 --> 30:41.172
Play with you like this

30:44.008 --> 30:45.718
What should I think?

30:49.097 --> 30:51.933
I'm trying to understand your past.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.020
A bit earthy, right?

30:56.688 --> 30:58.273
you said before

30:59.440 --> 31:00.859
You want to know how I grew up

31:02.402 --> 31:04.779
What do you think?

31:13.872 --> 31:15.999
-Take it
-Thank you sister

31:18.293 --> 31:20.962
loyal to one's life

31:22.130 --> 31:23.673
Not afraid of danger

31:25.091 --> 31:27.135
Now I understand why

31:31.389 --> 31:34.434
My father would love to see you

31:36.603 --> 31:37.604
are you hungry?

31:39.022 --> 31:40.189
Let's go eat

31:41.691 --> 31:43.234
Now you have to do what I want

31:48.072 --> 31:49.032
Big brother

31:54.370 --> 31:55.788
Those stinky guys

33:10.488 --> 33:11.572
Why don't you eat?

33:13.074 --> 33:16.953
Watching you eat makes me full

33:23.835 --> 33:26.337
The woman next to Mr. Zheng this morning

33:27.588 --> 33:28.589
who is she?

33:30.008 --> 33:30.967
His girlfriend?

33:32.093 --> 33:33.219
Probably not

33:34.303 --> 33:35.388
definitely is

33:36.055 --> 33:38.182
They look at each other very affectionately

33:40.893 --> 33:41.811
Qitie

33:44.647 --> 33:45.732
Are you doubting me?

33:47.233 --> 33:48.317
Because I'm a police officer?

33:51.529 --> 33:52.905
I thought you already knew

33:53.489 --> 33:54.824
what i'm doing

33:55.825 --> 33:56.868
I know

33:57.535 --> 33:59.454
I know what you do is unusual

34:00.371 --> 34:01.622
-But...
-Rogue

34:04.167 --> 34:05.668
Everyone calls me that

34:07.170 --> 34:09.338
That's not wrong.

34:12.258 --> 34:13.259
Initially

34:14.761 --> 34:16.971
I thought it was fate that we would meet again

34:18.514 --> 34:20.349
I always hope to see you

34:21.225 --> 34:23.102
So I often go to the places we used to go

34:25.813 --> 34:27.607
But since I saw you again

34:28.107 --> 34:29.776
A lot of things happened

34:31.944 --> 34:33.946
You know Chenghao

34:35.740 --> 34:37.450
And the timing of your appearance

34:39.410 --> 34:40.953
you know what happened

34:41.037 --> 34:44.040
I met Chenghao because his father abused drugs

34:44.665 --> 34:47.251
And the case of his cousin Kwon Tae Ho

34:50.254 --> 34:52.840
I'm also surprised that we meet again

34:53.299 --> 34:55.510
Maybe this is all more than a coincidence

34:56.135 --> 34:58.638
Maybe we are destined to meet again

34:58.721 --> 35:00.181
This is our fate

35:00.556 --> 35:03.184
I know it's silly of me to still think this way

35:03.684 --> 35:06.604
I'm as flustered as you are

35:08.314 --> 35:10.942
Mr. Zheng is a bit...

35:11.901 --> 35:14.320
I want to talk about our affairs, not people who are not present

35:17.115 --> 35:19.784
I want to hear your answers to the questions you asked

35:21.202 --> 35:22.245
Speaking of work

35:23.621 --> 35:25.373
Which one do you think is more important?

35:26.290 --> 35:27.250
Your heart or money?

35:28.835 --> 35:29.877
Xiong Mao

35:35.049 --> 35:36.175
new quote

35:37.135 --> 35:39.929
According to Mr. Zheng, we want double the price

35:40.555 --> 35:41.764
30 million per kilogram

35:42.431 --> 35:44.934
Need to double the quantity

35:45.935 --> 35:47.353
Meaning 16kg per delivery

35:48.229 --> 35:51.858
It's very risky to suddenly add so many goods.

35:51.941 --> 35:53.651
Both for us and Japan

35:55.570 --> 35:57.738
I want a good reason

35:57.822 --> 35:59.740
to please my father

36:03.369 --> 36:05.204
Okay, I'll ask the boss

36:05.580 --> 36:06.789
no

36:06.873 --> 36:08.124
You decide

36:08.207 --> 36:10.042
You said that one day you would be on your own

36:11.586 --> 36:13.796
You asked me which one is more important when it comes to work?

36:15.756 --> 36:17.091
Of course it's money

36:18.634 --> 36:20.011
But I like you, Chenghao

36:21.846 --> 36:24.140
So this time I will follow my heart

36:29.562 --> 36:31.230
Start working with me now

36:34.066 --> 36:36.903
Okay, I'll tell you the truth

36:38.362 --> 36:40.239
To be honest, after meeting you

36:40.781 --> 36:43.034
I checked your criminal record

36:44.744 --> 36:47.121
Chenghao's cousin Quan Taihu was killed

36:48.372 --> 36:49.749
I heard he is your friend

36:50.499 --> 36:53.294
The number one suspect, Zhang Jingzhe,

36:53.836 --> 36:55.171
Missing and unaccounted for

36:55.254 --> 36:57.798
You've worked with him before...

37:05.723 --> 37:07.183
So after meeting me

37:09.018 --> 37:10.686
You know I'm a suspect

37:12.980 --> 37:15.566
You just kept seeing me, is it the same today?

37:15.942 --> 37:17.109
It's not like this

37:18.194 --> 37:20.029
I know you best

37:20.696 --> 37:23.199
I know you have nothing to do with that disappearance case

37:26.035 --> 37:27.370
How can you be so sure?

37:30.206 --> 37:31.916
Even if you are involved in the case

37:33.542 --> 37:34.669
I don't care either

37:38.714 --> 37:39.882
I trust you

37:42.927 --> 37:44.136
This is the truth

37:46.430 --> 37:48.182
when your father died

37:50.059 --> 37:51.978
I shouldn't have let you leave like that

37:53.187 --> 37:55.314
No matter what, I should stay by your side

37:58.109 --> 37:59.402
Your Dream…

38:01.445 --> 38:03.572
I will stay with you until your dream comes true

38:04.657 --> 38:06.117
What I can do as a police officer

38:07.201 --> 38:10.288
The information that can be obtained and the protection that can be provided

38:12.748 --> 38:13.916
I'm willing to give it to you

38:23.843 --> 38:25.428
You must trust me

38:32.727 --> 38:33.728
Why?

38:37.106 --> 38:38.357
Why should I trust you?

38:42.611 --> 38:43.696
because…

38:46.282 --> 38:47.658
I love you

39:29.658 --> 39:31.410
I'll try

39:31.786 --> 39:33.204
Call the boss immediately

39:46.384 --> 39:47.343
Hello

39:47.426 --> 39:50.429
The Japanese went to the Zaijian Gang's lair. What should they do?

39:51.138 --> 39:53.474
I have to go back to the office. Let’s talk about it later.

39:54.683 --> 39:55.768
good

39:57.561 --> 39:58.604
what did he say?

39:58.687 --> 40:00.231
He told us to go back to the office

40:00.689 --> 40:02.733
So why are we waiting here?

40:03.484 --> 40:05.152
Do you want to go back to the office?

40:06.112 --> 40:07.363
follow me

40:07.446 --> 40:09.281
I want to introduce you to my staff

40:10.783 --> 40:12.368
I want to spend more time with you

40:22.211 --> 40:23.379
Decide quickly

40:29.427 --> 40:31.679
OK, I accept your proposal

40:32.179 --> 40:34.849
I hope Mr. Zheng will not make you regret it

40:34.932 --> 40:36.267
you know me

40:37.518 --> 40:38.769
Don't worry

40:43.274 --> 40:45.651
Tell dad that I chose Boss Zheng

40:46.485 --> 40:47.486
but…

40:48.654 --> 40:49.655
Change someone

40:50.364 --> 40:51.407
it's him

41:45.211 --> 41:46.212
master

41:50.799 --> 41:52.343
-Master
-Nobita

41:52.801 --> 41:55.012
The lady chooses Boss Zheng’s company

41:56.472 --> 42:01.435
But the person doing the transaction was replaced by a young man named Quan Chenghao.

42:02.728 --> 42:05.898
If there are cracks in the cup, it will be unsightly.

42:06.315 --> 42:07.733
Although inappropriate

42:07.816 --> 42:09.860
but i like getting new things

42:11.070 --> 42:12.738
Take good care of Hailian

42:13.405 --> 42:16.951
Also, definitely don’t go near Boss Zheng tonight.

42:21.205 --> 42:22.289
call sister-in-law

42:22.373 --> 42:23.832
She is my future wife

42:26.293 --> 42:27.336
-Sister-in-law
-Sister-in-law

42:30.548 --> 42:31.549
Qitie

42:31.924 --> 42:33.509
Is she the woman from before?

42:35.302 --> 42:37.012
When I see my sister-in-law, I want to call someone

42:37.429 --> 42:39.932
You have to be polite to your sister-in-law, you know?

42:40.015 --> 42:41.100
-Yes
-Yes, boss

42:42.601 --> 42:43.769
Let's go

42:47.940 --> 42:48.941
Sort it out

42:49.608 --> 42:50.734
give me a cigarette

42:53.195 --> 42:54.655
What happened?

42:58.200 --> 42:59.952
Why didn't you take me to see the fish this morning?

43:02.371 --> 43:03.539
It's very dirty here

43:06.125 --> 43:07.459
How can it be dirty

43:08.711 --> 43:09.878
Can I take a tour?

43:09.962 --> 43:10.963
Please see

43:13.382 --> 43:15.759
I heard you worked as a DJ before

43:16.635 --> 43:18.804
You have loved music since you were a child

43:19.513 --> 43:21.348
I knew you could be a DJ

43:23.434 --> 43:25.144
Did you ever care about how I was doing?

43:28.689 --> 43:29.898
Can you listen to this?

43:38.574 --> 43:39.825
Qitie, can we have a chat?

43:41.535 --> 43:42.536
Wait a moment

43:47.041 --> 43:48.459
Is she a police officer?

43:48.834 --> 43:51.170
Are you going to gather your younger brothers to introduce her?

43:53.464 --> 43:54.506
right

43:54.923 --> 43:58.218
I know you like her.
Even if you like her, you can't bring the police here.

44:00.596 --> 44:02.973
Don't worry, nothing will happen

44:04.141 --> 44:05.392
How do we know?

44:06.310 --> 44:08.062
Is it because of her that you drove away Zhengpei?

44:09.396 --> 44:10.481
Hong Xicheng

44:15.569 --> 44:17.613
This is really inappropriate

44:18.405 --> 44:20.366
What should I do if she wants to take advantage of you?

44:20.449 --> 44:21.867
What are you using me for?

44:22.576 --> 44:25.287
I can't tell

44:25.371 --> 44:27.414
But anyway, what we did was very risky.

44:27.498 --> 44:28.582
And I hate the police

44:28.666 --> 44:31.001
Just thinking about the police makes me tremble all over

44:31.085 --> 44:32.544
you do not trust me?

44:34.088 --> 44:35.547
I trust you

44:37.216 --> 44:39.426
I'm just not sure if this is right

44:42.680 --> 44:43.681
It's okay

44:45.557 --> 44:46.684
I am measured

44:51.313 --> 44:52.523
boss

44:53.482 --> 44:55.609
What should we do about the Japanese joining forces with the Zaijian Gang?

44:57.695 --> 45:00.614
Chenghao is meeting with the Chinese, let’s see what happens.

45:01.365 --> 45:04.910
Anyway, those Japanese can't cause trouble if they don't have the goods.

45:06.495 --> 45:07.871
The goods are in the hands of the Chinese

45:08.914 --> 45:10.666
You let Chenghao handle it all.

45:14.878 --> 45:16.547
Go and pick up girls by yourself?

45:17.172 --> 45:19.007
This is my choice and my decision

45:20.134 --> 45:21.719
Just trust me, Nisei

45:23.011 --> 45:24.179
Okay?

45:25.556 --> 45:26.557
All right

45:30.519 --> 45:34.022
Now that the official business is over, let's continue dating

45:45.743 --> 45:48.787
Still remember our feelings

45:50.122 --> 45:51.498
Sudden disconnection?

45:55.377 --> 45:56.628
after we separated

45:59.047 --> 46:01.925
I became very confused

46:03.010 --> 46:04.511
My mother goes to jail

46:05.345 --> 46:07.014
Minzhu is so small

46:09.516 --> 46:11.101
We live in an orphanage

46:12.311 --> 46:15.230
The kids in the courtyard bullied me
, saying I was the son of a murderer.

46:16.482 --> 46:18.358
So I ran away with Minjoo

46:19.067 --> 46:21.111
can you come to me

46:21.987 --> 46:23.155
No, it can't be like that.

46:28.243 --> 46:31.038
You are brave and loyal

46:31.497 --> 46:32.748
Kind

46:33.123 --> 46:34.458
the most important is

46:37.211 --> 46:38.420
Very handsome

46:50.516 --> 46:51.642
Want to go to bed with me?

46:54.770 --> 46:55.771
In no mood?

46:59.358 --> 47:00.943
Then the transaction will be cancelled.

47:16.208 --> 47:19.086
I will do whatever it takes to survive

47:21.630 --> 47:23.173
Dream and plan for the future

47:24.341 --> 47:25.676
It's a luxury for me

47:28.136 --> 47:29.721
I have nothing and have read few books

47:30.430 --> 47:32.057
You can only do this kind of thing

47:38.981 --> 47:40.691
you made me regret it

47:43.819 --> 47:45.821
Now I really want to be a good person

47:47.030 --> 47:49.408
You said you would help me and protect me

47:51.285 --> 47:52.661
You said you trust me

47:57.332 --> 47:58.709
you said you loved me

48:03.672 --> 48:05.007
Those are all true words, right?

51:04.519 --> 51:05.520
What's wrong?

51:14.446 --> 51:16.448
The master has decided to choose to form a gang again

51:17.949 --> 51:19.951
And we will build a gang again tonight...

51:23.830 --> 51:25.457
Will attack Boss Zheng

51:37.260 --> 51:38.303
What's wrong?

51:45.185 --> 51:46.686
tell me something?

51:55.320 --> 51:56.696
Maybe this is best

52:01.451 --> 52:02.452
Chenghao

52:06.081 --> 52:08.166
You don't need Mr. Zheng, right?

52:09.334 --> 52:11.336
There will be good news soon

52:12.379 --> 52:15.549
Let's wait while we drink.

52:24.766 --> 52:25.934
Jiangnan Society

52:27.102 --> 52:28.103
today

52:29.020 --> 52:30.313
we will kill them all

52:55.380 --> 52:56.715
hateful

52:57.465 --> 52:58.884
This tastes really bad

52:59.759 --> 53:00.760
Do not you think so?

53:02.470 --> 53:03.430
I think it is ok

53:14.316 --> 53:16.860
How was your conversation with the Chinese?

53:16.943 --> 53:19.404
Brother Xu, the Jian Gang is out again.

53:19.487 --> 53:20.947
You have to guard the office

53:22.657 --> 53:23.783
What's wrong?

53:25.785 --> 53:27.787
He said that the people who formed another gang came to kill him.

53:28.246 --> 53:29.456
What are you talking about?

53:40.550 --> 53:41.760
Damn it

53:44.137 --> 53:45.764
There is an attack

53:48.600 --> 53:50.435
What is it called?

53:57.442 --> 53:59.486
Son of a bitch, guys get ready

53:59.569 --> 54:00.695
-Yes, bro
. -Go get the dick.

54:01.821 --> 54:03.365
Let's help these bastards again

54:03.448 --> 54:05.283
They must be here to die.

54:05.700 --> 54:07.369
How dare you be so arrogant?

54:07.953 --> 54:09.537
Call someone from outside to come over

54:10.163 --> 54:11.331
These bastards

54:11.790 --> 54:13.083
A bunch of bastards

54:13.166 --> 54:14.751
Qitie, the war has begun

54:18.672 --> 54:19.798
Qitie, what's wrong?

54:19.881 --> 54:21.049
Step aside

54:21.132 --> 54:23.593
Come here, bastard

54:34.896 --> 54:36.523
What are you guys doing here?

54:38.441 --> 54:39.943
You said you trusted me, right?

54:40.026 --> 54:41.361
I want you to understand

54:41.778 --> 54:44.030
Believe in what is in front of you from now on

54:45.323 --> 54:46.324
Okay?

54:48.660 --> 54:50.036
damn guy

54:50.829 --> 54:51.830
Dekun

54:52.664 --> 54:55.208
What are you doing here? This is not your place

54:55.625 --> 54:57.210
Come and chop off your head

55:04.509 --> 55:05.635
Never come out

55:12.475 --> 55:13.977
hateful

55:18.023 --> 55:19.065
Start killing

55:20.317 --> 55:21.318
Son of a bitch

55:48.762 --> 55:49.763
Qitie

59:38.032 --> 59:40.034
