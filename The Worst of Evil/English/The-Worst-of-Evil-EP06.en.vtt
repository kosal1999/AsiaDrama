00:01.751 --> 00:08.717
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS OF THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL.

00:13.972 --> 00:16.016
You must be very busy, Mr. Jung.

00:20.228 --> 00:22.647
I came here by boat

00:24.566 --> 00:26.860
and I don't even know if I'll be able to see it.

00:27.736 --> 00:29.571
I'll go straight to see her.

00:31.614 --> 00:33.074
See you at the bar.

00:34.159 --> 00:36.369
My man is in the hall,

00:36.453 --> 00:38.705
ask him what you need.

00:40.790 --> 00:41.791
Well goodbye.

00:47.380 --> 00:48.381
Sorry.

00:48.798 --> 00:50.508
Isn't this place very elegant?

00:50.592 --> 00:52.677
Good food will give you energy.

00:52.761 --> 00:55.513
I'm sure your mother wants
you to feel well soon.

00:55.597 --> 00:57.474
Do not talk about it.

00:57.891 --> 00:58.933
Euijeong.

00:59.684 --> 01:00.727
When we were kids,

01:02.020 --> 01:04.189
I fled without saying anything.

01:04.272 --> 01:05.106
I'm sorry.

01:06.149 --> 01:07.150
Why did you do that?

01:07.400 --> 01:08.985
I didn't want to cause you problems.

01:10.904 --> 01:14.032
The entire neighborhood would have
denounced us as murderers.

01:18.286 --> 01:20.747
Do you remember the dream we were talking about?

01:21.081 --> 01:22.082
More or less.

01:22.165 --> 01:23.666
It almost came true, didn't it?

01:24.793 --> 01:27.045
How many locations do you have?

01:27.670 --> 01:32.383
Most are run by my employees.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.010
All together...

01:36.304 --> 01:37.430
I have many.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.891
How did you manage to open so many stores?

01:40.683 --> 01:43.019
It seems like you work with your old friends.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.479
Are they your partners?

01:44.562 --> 01:46.272
Or your employees?

01:46.356 --> 01:48.066
You make a lot of questions.

01:50.276 --> 01:54.197
I want to know what happened to your life.

01:56.366 --> 01:58.034
I also want to know about you.

01:58.910 --> 02:00.286
So, you fulfilled your dream.

02:02.455 --> 02:03.915
Now I should keep my promise.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.292
What promise?

02:44.247 --> 02:45.248
What is your dream?

02:45.665 --> 02:46.666
My dream?

02:47.625 --> 02:48.626
Have a nightclub?

02:49.836 --> 02:52.046
It's the most specific dream I ever heard.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.090
Not just a nightclub.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.427
I want to open a restaurant and cafe
next to the nightclub.

02:57.510 --> 03:00.513
And a cinema, a Chinese restaurant,
a bar and a Korean restaurant.

03:01.639 --> 03:05.059
So, whoever visits Gangnam,
will come to all my stores.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.811
And everyone will respect me.

03:08.146 --> 03:10.899
You would be like a "tycoon of the night."

03:11.441 --> 03:12.942
A tycoon?

03:13.026 --> 03:14.444
I like it.

03:14.944 --> 03:16.738
If I become this famous,

03:16.821 --> 03:19.699
I won't have to go to expensive universities
to marry you.

03:20.700 --> 03:21.784
What are you saying?

03:22.785 --> 03:24.370
I will become a tycoon.

03:24.454 --> 03:27.040
I will become a tycoon and marry you.

03:27.582 --> 03:28.708
I promise.

03:38.968 --> 03:44.933
THE WORST OF EVIL

04:00.949 --> 04:02.075
Where are the Chinese?

04:02.367 --> 04:03.451
Now they are up.

04:04.202 --> 04:05.203
Any problem?

04:05.495 --> 04:06.496
No, boss.

04:08.414 --> 04:09.624
Where was it?

04:12.627 --> 04:14.045
Hello, this is Jung Gicheul.

04:14.712 --> 04:15.713
I arrived.

04:42.365 --> 04:43.992
Thank you for coming here.

04:45.243 --> 04:46.953
You can use it during your stay.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.667
Are you fucking with me?

05:17.233 --> 05:18.234
What is this?

05:18.609 --> 05:19.610
A gift for you.

05:27.243 --> 05:29.078
Professor Yoon used the same one.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.915
Is that how you handle everything?

05:40.506 --> 05:41.341
Man...

05:41.424 --> 05:43.343
You don't even have a fucking lighter?

05:44.093 --> 05:45.094
Oye.

05:51.059 --> 05:53.811
With the losses we suffer

05:54.145 --> 05:56.481
in getting the boat
and crew ready...

05:59.108 --> 06:01.277
Don't you owe me at least a gold watch?

06:05.907 --> 06:07.241
I apologize again.

06:07.325 --> 06:08.368
I'm sorry.

06:08.451 --> 06:09.827
It will not happen again.

06:11.579 --> 06:14.832
I only work
with people I can trust.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.962
That's what my father always says.

06:21.255 --> 06:23.549
So that we can trade again as before,

06:24.467 --> 06:26.594
We will regain confidence.

06:26.677 --> 06:29.097
Restore confidence?

06:30.473 --> 06:32.809
As they say here,

06:33.810 --> 06:35.103
keep dreaming, Mr. Jung.

06:39.273 --> 06:40.650
What else can I do for you?

06:44.112 --> 06:47.490
The Japanese
must have many contacts.

06:49.242 --> 06:52.120
I don't know how they did it,
but they called my father

06:54.664 --> 06:56.916
to suggest
that the three of us meet in Korea.

06:57.333 --> 06:58.459
That's why I'm here.

07:01.129 --> 07:04.715
But why meet in person
if we can talk on the phone?

07:06.509 --> 07:08.010
I think I know why.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.599
I'm tired. Leave.

07:15.768 --> 07:16.936
Haeryun.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.857
We want to increase imports

07:21.566 --> 07:22.817
8 to 10 kilos.

07:23.860 --> 07:27.613
We will pay
the extra charge, not Japan.

07:32.910 --> 07:35.997
He became very generous
when he learned that the Japanese were coming,

07:36.080 --> 07:37.039
Mr. Jung.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.215
Too late.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.022
-This is Oyama.
-Hello.

08:01.439 --> 08:03.900
See you tomorrow at 2:00 pm

08:04.317 --> 08:05.443
Are you in Korea?

08:07.195 --> 08:08.571
Did father come too?

08:09.280 --> 08:11.782
Tomorrow I will inform you of the location.

08:20.166 --> 08:23.002
Mr. Murayama from Japan called.

08:23.085 --> 08:27.798
He said that the bosses of the Yokohama branch
of the Yoshioka-gumi

08:27.882 --> 08:30.593
They are heading to Korea.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.762
Se llama Oyama Tsuyoshi.

08:33.471 --> 08:35.932
You will also stay
at the Grand Plaza Hotel in Gangnam,

08:36.015 --> 08:37.850
just like the Chinese.

08:38.559 --> 08:39.936
You will occupy room 608.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.395
And the Chinese?

08:41.479 --> 08:43.564
In rooms 850 and 851.

08:43.648 --> 08:46.150
Maybe they will come to talk about the attack

08:46.234 --> 08:47.985
who interrupted the purchase.

08:50.071 --> 08:52.865
It would be nice to put microphones
in the rooms.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.951
Then we asked for the court order.

08:55.368 --> 08:59.247
Inspectors will monitor cameras
in the hotel hallways.

08:59.330 --> 09:02.917
When we see them enter
the same room or go somewhere,

09:03.000 --> 09:05.002
we will plant microphones in every room.

09:05.294 --> 09:08.422
If Jung Gicheul meets them,

09:08.506 --> 09:11.008
It would be ideal if Inspector Park
was also there.

09:11.092 --> 09:12.718
If so...

09:13.469 --> 09:15.012
Toma.

09:15.096 --> 09:17.515
This microphone covers
a radius of one kilometer.

09:18.266 --> 09:20.434
Inspector Park will carry this.

09:20.518 --> 09:22.645
I will listen to everything that happens

09:22.770 --> 09:24.355
and I will record in real time.

09:24.438 --> 09:25.273
Finished?

09:26.983 --> 09:28.276
I'm leaving then.

09:29.485 --> 09:31.112
The triangle of three countries.

09:31.779 --> 09:33.281
The international poster.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.410
By the way, Mr. Cho,

09:39.245 --> 09:44.041
When can Inspector Yoo
stop seeing Jung Gicheul?

09:44.959 --> 09:48.588
We don't want to do this either.

09:48.671 --> 09:51.757
We can't let
it disappear suddenly.

09:52.216 --> 09:55.428
Let's arrest them all
with the evidence we get now

09:55.511 --> 09:56.887
and let's close the case quickly.

10:02.143 --> 10:05.271
GANGNAM POLICE STATION

10:15.990 --> 10:17.366
What is the name of the missing person?

10:17.450 --> 10:18.743
Cho Janghyun.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.996
But they call him Manager Cho.

10:22.079 --> 10:23.581
Manager of what company?

10:25.416 --> 10:26.584
Which was?

10:27.627 --> 10:28.753
Of our company.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.302
When did you lose contact with him?

10:37.470 --> 10:38.596
-Well...
-Jeez...

10:39.764 --> 10:42.266
That's not what happened.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.101
Was it last Monday?

10:44.727 --> 10:45.728
I do not know.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.521
Last Monday

10:47.605 --> 10:50.566
They kidnapped him before our eyes.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.942
This is very frustrating.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.027
He was kidnapped?

10:58.949 --> 11:00.159
Cho, the drug addict?

11:00.409 --> 11:01.410
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

11:04.413 --> 11:06.082
-Roll up your sleeves.
-That?

11:06.165 --> 11:07.291
Let's go. ArremÃ¡nguense.

11:08.959 --> 11:11.003
Why is your arm so dirty?

11:11.379 --> 11:13.047
They are Manager Cho's henchmen.

11:13.130 --> 11:14.006
Sorry?

11:16.384 --> 11:17.593
So, to Manager Cho

11:19.470 --> 11:20.513
he was kidnapped?

11:22.890 --> 11:25.101
There is something called Gangnam Crystal.

11:25.184 --> 11:28.688
It is a popular type of methamphetamine.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.106
Who's your boss?

11:30.940 --> 11:33.192
There is a drug dealer called Yankees,

11:33.275 --> 11:34.985
We told him to bring his boss.

11:35.069 --> 11:37.947
We brought that guy in,
and three took Manager Cho.

11:38.030 --> 11:39.740
We have to catch that Yankees guy,

11:39.824 --> 11:41.492
but we don't know where to start

11:41.575 --> 11:43.869
-and we don't have...
-Hey!

11:43.953 --> 11:46.497
Are you high? Why do you ramble?

11:46.872 --> 11:48.999
Tell me about that Yankees guy.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.042
And stop crying.

11:50.835 --> 11:53.713
We took him in, beat him up
and asked him questions.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.047
-To Yankees?
-Yeah.

11:55.131 --> 11:58.259
-AND?
-All the names he said

11:58.342 --> 12:00.052
They were fake.

12:01.679 --> 12:04.056
But we noticed
that they are all from Yeoksam High School.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.182
Yeoksam High School.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.017
As?

12:07.101 --> 12:07.977
Dime.

12:08.185 --> 12:09.311
How did they know?

12:11.814 --> 12:13.149
I checked his pockets.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.320
An entrance
to Dongdaemun Baseball Stadium.

12:19.572 --> 12:20.573
Â¿Y?

12:21.490 --> 12:22.825
That day, there was a game

12:23.617 --> 12:24.785
entre Yeoksam

12:24.869 --> 12:25.995
the Gwangju Jail.

12:28.414 --> 12:29.790
-The game that day?
-Yeah.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.208
Â¿Yeoksam versus Gwangju Jeil?

12:31.292 --> 12:32.126
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

12:32.668 --> 12:34.170
-That's why Yeoksam High School.
-Yeah.

12:36.422 --> 12:39.175
How retarded.

12:40.718 --> 12:42.094
We solved it.

12:42.178 --> 12:44.805
Yeoksam High School graduates
are very close-knit

12:44.889 --> 12:46.223
-in Gangnam.
-Yeah.

12:46.307 --> 12:47.266
Clear.

13:07.953 --> 13:08.954
Â¿Hola?

13:09.038 --> 13:10.915
Come to the Grand Plaza Hotel.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.542
Bring the Chinese.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.669
Good. I will go with them.

13:15.753 --> 13:19.256
Then I'll tell you where in the hotel.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.383
Can I go with my men?

13:22.134 --> 13:23.677
Bring only one bodyguard.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.060
Kwon Seungho.

13:31.727 --> 13:33.312
Yes Boss?

13:33.395 --> 13:34.396
accompany me

13:34.814 --> 13:36.899
The rest wait at the hotel door.

13:36.982 --> 13:37.817
With discretion.

13:56.001 --> 13:57.711
What the fuck?

13:58.671 --> 14:00.130
Hey, cum!

14:01.006 --> 14:02.675
Fool.

14:02.758 --> 14:05.010
Where are you going in such a hurry?

14:05.302 --> 14:06.679
You almost ran him over.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.973
-Excuse me, sir.
-You almost ran him over.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.434
You believe yourself more for having a Mercedes.

14:12.768 --> 14:13.811
Get out of the car.

14:13.936 --> 14:15.104
-Damn...
-Come on.

14:15.396 --> 14:17.773
Low. I am Police.

14:19.483 --> 14:21.277
What an idiot.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.031
Drive better, bad boy.

14:26.782 --> 14:29.577
Hello, Mr. Jung. So long.

14:29.660 --> 14:30.828
Wait.

14:30.911 --> 14:31.912
Oh, the back.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.164
Low. I want to talk to you.

14:34.498 --> 14:37.334
What the fuck?

14:38.002 --> 14:39.295
Listen.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.422
What are you doing now?

14:41.505 --> 14:42.631
Do you have an order?

14:42.798 --> 14:46.719
Where did you get that from the order?

14:46.802 --> 14:48.721
I asked if you have a fucking order.

14:49.179 --> 14:50.472
You're a...

14:51.765 --> 14:53.684
I've never seen this face.

14:54.101 --> 14:56.520
You are new?

14:57.813 --> 14:59.356
Bad fucking birth.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.191
Isn't it going to go down?

15:02.359 --> 15:04.028
Curse.

15:06.071 --> 15:07.948
-What's happening?
-Mr. Jung.

15:08.449 --> 15:10.367
You know Yankees, right?

15:10.451 --> 15:13.370
Looks like he got rid
of a drug addict named Manager Cho.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.874
I wanted to talk to him,
but I can't reach him.

15:16.957 --> 15:19.084
It's one of yours. He should know where she is.

15:19.168 --> 15:20.085
Where is?

15:20.252 --> 15:21.462
Do not know him.

15:21.545 --> 15:22.588
Listen.

15:22.671 --> 15:24.131
Are you serious?

15:24.214 --> 15:27.009
They are both in Gangnam night.

15:27.134 --> 15:29.178
And they all went
to Yeoksam High School.

15:29.261 --> 15:31.305
Hola, inspector.

15:31.388 --> 15:33.223
What brings you here?

15:33.307 --> 15:34.600
Are you okay, inspector?

15:34.683 --> 15:35.976
Hello, Jungbae.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.103
No, because of you, idiots.

15:38.812 --> 15:41.231
Jungbae, Heesung.

15:41.315 --> 15:43.484
-Yeah.
-Do you know Yankees?

15:43.901 --> 15:45.694
That? Yankees?

15:45.778 --> 15:47.529
I don't know who it is.

15:47.613 --> 15:50.824
Come on. They must know it.
He went to his school.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.786
I went to Yeoksam High School,
the worst school ever.

15:54.203 --> 15:57.206
I know that you take care of the alumni.

15:57.289 --> 15:58.832
Come on, inspector.

15:58.916 --> 16:02.044
In our school,
there are 12 courses for each year.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.838
And more than 50 students in each one.
We don't know them all

16:05.547 --> 16:09.259
I can question them to see if it's true.

16:09.343 --> 16:10.719
Inspector.

16:11.178 --> 16:12.930
Excuse me, but we're busy.

16:14.306 --> 16:15.349
Let's go.

16:19.019 --> 16:20.187
Hey, Jung Gicheul.

16:20.312 --> 16:23.732
If his henchman Yankees
killed Manager Cho,

16:23.816 --> 16:25.401
It will not be a drug crime.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.319
It will be a violent crime.

16:27.778 --> 16:29.238
What do you think it means?

16:32.741 --> 16:34.743
That you will see me often.

16:36.745 --> 16:37.746
See you.

16:39.832 --> 16:40.916
Here is your key.

16:46.046 --> 16:49.550
What is your name?

16:54.722 --> 16:55.764
Â¿Yankees?

17:00.853 --> 17:01.854
Viejo...

17:02.938 --> 17:04.773
We'll see each other more often.

17:12.740 --> 17:15.200
That? He said he was busy.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.202
Keep going.

17:18.078 --> 17:19.204
You don't have to accompany me.

17:27.921 --> 17:31.050
They won't go straight to that Yankees guy

17:31.133 --> 17:33.552
just because he named it

17:33.719 --> 17:35.512
Why do we follow them?

17:36.055 --> 17:38.140
We have nothing to do.

17:38.223 --> 17:39.224
Are you busy?

17:40.225 --> 17:42.478
Let's follow them for today

17:42.561 --> 17:44.521
Let's see where they come together

17:44.605 --> 17:46.523
and what are they doing these days.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.067
I think we lost them.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.694
Alright. It's a fucking Mercedes.

17:50.778 --> 17:53.072
A Mercedes can be seen from 100 meters.

18:05.167 --> 18:08.545
-Hello.
-Come to room 1203.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.593
The security office
is clear, over.

18:56.677 --> 18:58.679
Good. All areas are clear.

18:58.762 --> 19:00.597
There are no signs of intruders.

19:00.681 --> 19:02.182
The parking lot is clear.

19:11.525 --> 19:12.985
Park Junmo. Good.

19:15.445 --> 19:17.656
Jung Gicheul arrived at the hotel.
Pay attention.

19:17.739 --> 19:20.450
Proceed only when we have the evidence.

19:26.456 --> 19:28.917
The microphone covers
a radius of one kilometer.

19:29.543 --> 19:31.461
Inspector Park will carry this.

19:31.545 --> 19:33.422
I will listen to everything that happens

19:33.505 --> 19:35.090
and I will record in real time.

19:45.851 --> 19:48.103
They are taking the elevator.

19:50.731 --> 19:52.691
The Koreans entered the lobby.

19:52.774 --> 19:53.942
They'll be up to one soon.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.694
What floor is it on?

19:55.777 --> 19:56.778
On the 12th floor.

20:05.162 --> 20:07.581
It's Hwang Mingoo, the policeman.

20:08.999 --> 20:10.584
There's someone in the hallway.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.701
The Koreans reached the 12th floor.

20:50.540 --> 20:52.793
Before entering, curl them.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.378
Â¿Cachearlos?

21:47.848 --> 21:49.349
One of the Koreans passed by.

21:49.433 --> 21:50.809
It's the second's turn.

21:53.895 --> 21:55.022
It just can't be.

22:31.683 --> 22:34.102
Are you fucking with me?

23:04.174 --> 23:06.385
You are very meticulous.

23:23.777 --> 23:25.445
-Activate the fire alarm.
-That?

23:25.529 --> 23:27.781
Activate the fire alarm
right now!

23:27.864 --> 23:30.909
Stop touching me. Perhaps you like?

23:31.743 --> 23:33.453
Come on. The fire alarm!

23:47.175 --> 23:49.302
I'll go see what's going on.

24:18.039 --> 24:19.666
Dohyung.

24:19.749 --> 24:22.627
The Japanese are frisking us.

24:22.711 --> 24:24.463
I'll have to throw away the microphone.

24:24.880 --> 24:25.881
I'm going to throw it away.

24:28.633 --> 24:29.718
Wait.

24:32.762 --> 24:34.598
I think I can handle it.

24:51.448 --> 24:53.033
It was a false alarm.

25:34.491 --> 25:36.660
Take them to the room and wait.

26:11.695 --> 26:12.696
Curse.

26:13.446 --> 26:15.532
Down the volume. It's very high.

26:22.539 --> 26:23.582
Motherfucker.

26:25.750 --> 26:28.878
Hey, can't you talk?

26:36.803 --> 26:39.848
You must be very shy.

26:40.348 --> 26:44.060
The Japanese police began to monitor us.

26:45.520 --> 26:46.896
Father couldn't come?

26:48.481 --> 26:49.858
If possible,

26:50.775 --> 26:53.987
I would like to meet his father in China.

26:55.405 --> 26:56.948
You can meet me.

26:58.992 --> 27:03.163
Aren't you the boss in Japan?

27:04.581 --> 27:06.458
How is Professor Yoon?

27:06.541 --> 27:09.294
Splendid. We treat her very well.

27:09.961 --> 27:11.171
Do you know her well?

27:12.005 --> 27:16.384
We bought a lot of product from them 20 years ago.

27:17.302 --> 27:18.386
What's that?

27:19.679 --> 27:21.473
It's the advance they gave me.

27:22.223 --> 27:23.558
Why do you return it?

27:23.642 --> 27:25.226
Are you going out of business?

27:26.144 --> 27:27.228
No.

27:28.563 --> 27:31.107
We will resend the product,
and when it arrives well,

27:31.191 --> 27:32.525
They will pay us.

27:32.609 --> 27:35.320
Then you will get paid later.

27:36.404 --> 27:38.281
Isn't that a lot of formality?

27:39.991 --> 27:40.992
And the traitor?

27:41.743 --> 27:43.078
They found him?

27:43.161 --> 27:44.329
Yeah.

27:44.829 --> 27:45.997
Who was?

27:46.289 --> 27:48.041
One of our members.

27:48.917 --> 27:50.669
Did you have direct involvement in this?

27:50.960 --> 27:51.961
No.

27:53.171 --> 27:56.216
Do you know about our business?

27:56.883 --> 27:57.884
No.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.136
Like I just said,

28:00.220 --> 28:01.721
the police are watching us.

28:01.846 --> 28:05.016
Could it be because of Song Donghyuk?

28:05.100 --> 28:06.768
He must have told his gang

28:07.727 --> 28:10.021
that he was going to meet father.

28:11.064 --> 28:13.942
But he never came back,
maybe they reported him missing,

28:15.026 --> 28:17.153
and the Japanese police found out.

28:17.445 --> 28:20.365
So, it's not for you,
but for us?

28:22.701 --> 28:26.204
It's possible that you too

28:26.287 --> 28:30.083
be watched because of the traitor.

28:37.799 --> 28:41.010
The bag you brought.

28:41.553 --> 28:45.473
Put it down, stand there for five minutes and come back

28:46.433 --> 28:49.853
as if you were waiting for the drug dealer.

28:50.979 --> 28:52.897
So I can see from here

28:52.981 --> 28:55.608
if the police follow you.

28:55.692 --> 28:59.070
And whether you're with a drug dealer or not.

29:01.239 --> 29:03.199
Is it a father's order?

29:03.283 --> 29:04.492
You do not want to do it?

29:05.702 --> 29:08.288
Then, the deal is over.

29:15.044 --> 29:17.338
Is it the end of our business?

29:18.548 --> 29:20.133
What a pity.

29:59.923 --> 30:02.801
Those morons are planning to get us.

30:04.636 --> 30:05.804
We still waiting?

30:07.180 --> 30:08.139
That?

30:09.390 --> 30:10.850
They wait too.

30:13.728 --> 30:15.772
Hwang Mingoo, how damn.

30:16.898 --> 30:19.025
Why does he always screw us?

30:42.298 --> 30:43.383
What's happening?

30:52.934 --> 30:54.519
I think it just came out.

31:00.066 --> 31:03.194
In fact, I made it go down

31:03.278 --> 31:05.655
so we could talk alone.

31:07.532 --> 31:10.952
You want to deal directly
with us, right?

31:17.083 --> 31:18.543
Because without intermediaries,

31:19.460 --> 31:23.256
We can divide the money
that goes to Mr. Jung.

31:37.478 --> 31:38.938
Maybe something went wrong.

31:52.827 --> 31:55.872
I'm with the woman from China.

31:56.664 --> 31:57.790
I'll let them talk.

31:58.416 --> 31:59.542
Damn.

31:59.626 --> 32:01.419
Those idiots always complicate everything.

32:04.255 --> 32:06.466
Captain, are you waiting
for a drug dealer?

32:06.674 --> 32:08.801
Should we arrest him when he sees someone?

32:20.146 --> 32:21.648
Do not move. Let's wait for now.

32:21.731 --> 32:23.024
They wait...

32:31.032 --> 32:35.119
What do you think is
in the bag that criminal is carrying?

32:38.623 --> 32:39.791
Something stolen?

32:41.334 --> 32:42.669
Drugs?

32:46.089 --> 32:47.840
Can I call you Miss Lee?

32:48.758 --> 32:50.802
Soy Kim Hwaseong.

32:50.885 --> 32:52.637
He must be Mr. Jung's father.

32:54.222 --> 32:55.765
My last name is Kim.

32:56.349 --> 33:01.020
He asked me if we wanted
to deal directly without Jung Gicheul.

33:01.104 --> 33:05.233
Do you know why I used Gicheul
as a carrier

33:05.316 --> 33:07.193
and I made him rich?

33:08.152 --> 33:10.822
I'm about to become

33:11.572 --> 33:13.491
in the Yoshioka-gumi boss.

33:13.616 --> 33:17.620
I don't want to get involved
in drug trafficking.

33:22.125 --> 33:23.251
Curse.

33:23.793 --> 33:25.962
We are about to witness an exchange.

33:27.547 --> 33:30.633
That means I need
to be invisible in this business.

33:31.175 --> 33:34.137
So that,
even if the Japanese police investigate me,

33:34.262 --> 33:38.516
It seems like everything was the work
of a Korean band

33:38.599 --> 33:41.394
that sells illegally imported merchandise
from China in Japan.

33:42.103 --> 33:43.396
That's why.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.859
The Korean band
will be solely responsible.

33:49.485 --> 33:53.865
What do you want to do now?

33:56.325 --> 33:57.910
What a bummer.

33:59.370 --> 34:02.623
We can replace Gicheul.

34:02.707 --> 34:04.834
I have many friends in Korea.

34:04.917 --> 34:07.211
We can choose one of them.

34:07.295 --> 34:08.588
My question is

34:08.671 --> 34:11.007
If you could produce
a product of the same quality

34:11.424 --> 34:14.844
and send it in perfect condition,
just as you have been doing.

34:16.304 --> 34:18.723
Do you think you could do that?

34:18.806 --> 34:20.933
I decide that.

34:22.727 --> 34:25.146
I decide which Korean

34:26.230 --> 34:27.982
I want to sell you our product.

34:28.691 --> 34:32.820
From what Gicheul pays him,

34:32.904 --> 34:37.533
I will pay you 15% more.

34:52.215 --> 34:54.425
We came to look for Yankees,

34:54.509 --> 34:55.968
and we have a bigger one.

35:24.747 --> 35:26.707
Who are these cretins?

35:27.125 --> 35:28.626
Damn.

35:34.632 --> 35:35.633
Where did they go?

35:38.719 --> 35:40.179
They are very fast.

35:41.514 --> 35:43.266
Detenlos.

35:45.309 --> 35:46.769
-Stop there.
-Inspector.

35:46.894 --> 35:49.021
We have something to do here.

35:49.105 --> 35:50.815
I said stop.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.404
Everything is alright now?

35:56.654 --> 35:58.865
That's for Miss Lee to decide.

36:05.037 --> 36:06.330
Hey, Chinese.

36:09.625 --> 36:10.835
Don't you speak Korean?

36:11.878 --> 36:13.129
You do not speak

36:14.755 --> 36:15.756
Korean?

36:16.883 --> 36:19.135
Your boss speaks fluent Korean.

36:23.806 --> 36:26.976
Do you understand me or not?

36:29.020 --> 36:31.814
Why is there so much silence?

36:38.237 --> 36:40.239
Do you still use matches?

36:41.032 --> 36:42.950
Are you from the Qing dynasty or what?

36:45.494 --> 36:47.163
Take. Keep him.

36:47.622 --> 36:49.290
I give it to you. Take it.

37:10.561 --> 37:11.854
The police came.

37:13.105 --> 37:14.815
A policeman comes.

37:14.899 --> 37:16.943
I take care of everything there.

37:17.026 --> 37:18.486
You flee with those inside...

37:18.569 --> 37:19.779
Â¡Oye!

37:22.823 --> 37:25.576
I said the police came. Understood?

37:26.244 --> 37:27.578
Take them and run. Now.

37:30.706 --> 37:31.791
Inspector.

37:33.334 --> 37:34.418
What brings you here?

37:34.502 --> 37:35.753
What do you think?

37:36.420 --> 37:37.797
I told you you'd see me again.

37:38.422 --> 37:40.216
What is Jung Gicheul doing there?

37:42.677 --> 37:44.220
He is doing business.

37:44.303 --> 37:47.473
Business, of course? Cum.

37:48.849 --> 37:49.850
I said cum.

37:50.393 --> 37:51.269
You heard me?

37:52.270 --> 37:55.106
Stop looking at me and cum.

37:55.189 --> 37:57.566
-Hey.
-I'm sorry.

37:57.650 --> 37:59.735
Did you go crazy? Cum.

37:59.819 --> 38:02.113
Â¡Oiga, Sr. Jung!

38:02.738 --> 38:05.866
Â¡Young Gicheul!

38:05.950 --> 38:07.910
There is.

38:07.994 --> 38:10.830
Â¡Oiga, Sr. Jung!

38:10.913 --> 38:12.665
Jung Gicheul, come here.

38:12.748 --> 38:15.334
Mr. Jung. Listen!

38:15.418 --> 38:17.962
-Let's finish our conversation.
-What were they doing?

38:18.045 --> 38:19.547
Did they play poker?

38:19.880 --> 38:20.840
Come here.

38:20.923 --> 38:22.091
Â¡Alto!

38:22.174 --> 38:24.635
Stop there, you bastard!

38:25.720 --> 38:27.263
Did you go crazy?

38:30.766 --> 38:32.601
Come on, inspector.

38:32.685 --> 38:34.520
-Do not be like that.
-You hit me?

38:34.603 --> 38:35.896
Are you spotting me?

38:52.079 --> 38:53.664
Come here, you bad boy.

39:25.863 --> 39:28.574
Mr. Jung, does
that mean our deal is off?

39:32.078 --> 39:33.204
I think so.

39:34.038 --> 39:37.541
It seems like she trusts her man a lot.

39:41.962 --> 39:44.340
Go help Mr. Jung's man.

39:45.174 --> 39:46.175
Let's go.

39:51.806 --> 39:53.682
Inspectors, go to the 12th floor.

39:54.725 --> 39:56.102
-Where are they?
-Here.

39:58.312 --> 40:00.064
-We found them.
-Arrest him.

40:00.147 --> 40:01.565
To which of the two?

40:01.649 --> 40:03.484
Who the hell are you?

40:03.901 --> 40:05.778
-To the big guy.
-Good.

40:05.861 --> 40:07.696
-Want to die?
-Fuck off.

40:07.780 --> 40:09.031
Motherfucker.

40:09.115 --> 40:10.866
-High!
-What do they do?

40:10.950 --> 40:11.909
Who are you?

40:11.992 --> 40:13.202
He is arrested.

40:13.285 --> 40:15.704
-Let go of me, you bastards.
-Stop moving.

40:15.788 --> 40:19.458
I'm a policeman, you idiots!

40:20.459 --> 40:23.337
I'm a real cop,
for God's sake!

40:23.421 --> 40:25.464
Sons of bitches!

40:25.548 --> 40:26.674
The fucking mother!

40:33.889 --> 40:36.225
Captain, you really are a police officer.

40:36.308 --> 40:37.435
Police?

40:37.726 --> 40:39.353
And the other guy?

40:39.437 --> 40:40.438
He escaped.

40:42.690 --> 40:44.066
Back off right now.

40:59.457 --> 41:04.587
The fucking mother. Idiots!

41:07.006 --> 41:08.007
Are you OK?

41:08.215 --> 41:09.633
Yes I'm fine.

41:09.967 --> 41:12.136
Let's go out when everything calms down.

41:12.470 --> 41:13.554
Yes Boss.

41:35.701 --> 41:37.745
Fucking police!

41:37.828 --> 41:39.914
You should have bribed him.

41:39.997 --> 41:41.457
Damn.

41:54.720 --> 41:56.764
We could let the policeman in.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.603
Chatting is not illegal.

42:02.686 --> 42:05.272
That policeman would have found something for us.

42:05.356 --> 42:07.191
And your passport

42:09.401 --> 42:10.778
Isn't it fake?

42:12.446 --> 42:13.989
were you protecting me

42:15.366 --> 42:16.492
of an arrest?

42:22.081 --> 42:24.041
It sounds like you had an intense fight.

42:28.546 --> 42:30.548
Does it mean everything will get worse?

42:31.799 --> 42:34.969
Making everything worse must be a quality of yours.

42:39.640 --> 42:42.434
Mr. Jung, you have a very wild way
of doing business.

42:44.520 --> 42:46.021
It is very dangerous to work with you.

42:46.230 --> 42:48.232
I got this injury recently.

42:48.315 --> 42:49.984
It's not serious.

42:50.067 --> 42:50.943
And until now,

42:51.026 --> 42:54.154
We never had problems
caused by issues like that.

42:54.238 --> 42:55.573
I assure you.

42:55.656 --> 42:56.532
I understand.

42:58.993 --> 43:01.120
For you, it's not even a problem.

43:04.081 --> 43:07.209
Could you at least do something
about the wound on your back?

43:07.918 --> 43:10.170
Someone could report you
for murder.

43:12.798 --> 43:13.799
Come here.

43:20.681 --> 43:22.308
Heal the wound.

43:24.476 --> 43:27.104
He risked his life to take responsibility,

43:27.354 --> 43:29.857
which is a good quality
in a business partner.

43:32.318 --> 43:34.945
That heavy!

43:35.029 --> 43:38.198
How many times do I have to repeat it?

43:38.282 --> 43:41.327
From room 1203

43:41.410 --> 43:44.038
a group of people came out.

43:44.121 --> 43:45.289
Men and women.

43:45.372 --> 43:46.707
And the room was huge!

43:46.790 --> 43:49.376
It doesn't make sense
that no one has booked it!

43:49.460 --> 43:52.838
No one booked room 1203 today.

43:53.088 --> 43:54.673
And who were those people?

43:54.757 --> 43:55.841
Were they ghosts?

43:57.009 --> 43:59.637
Tell me the truth, ma'am.

44:00.346 --> 44:02.473
Or you will have a criminal record.

44:02.556 --> 44:03.599
Show me the book.

44:03.807 --> 44:05.726
Do you think I'm not serious?

44:05.809 --> 44:07.019
SeÃ±or.

44:07.895 --> 44:09.563
-I looked for them.
-AND?

44:09.647 --> 44:10.898
I can't find anyone.

44:11.815 --> 44:13.776
Damn.

44:14.443 --> 44:15.486
Let's go then.

44:37.424 --> 44:41.679
The Japanese suggested
that we change Korean carrier.

44:44.348 --> 44:48.143
And they will pay me 15% more
than you pay me.

44:49.812 --> 44:51.188
We will pay you double

44:51.814 --> 44:53.691
of what we paid per kilo.

44:58.904 --> 45:00.656
Money is not the problem here.

45:03.617 --> 45:06.078
What will you do to regain my trust?

45:12.084 --> 45:15.713
It will be a difficult decision for us
to start over with another one.

45:16.672 --> 45:17.840
What do we do?

45:27.683 --> 45:30.602
You have a good man
willing to sacrifice himself

45:31.353 --> 45:33.021
for you.

45:34.273 --> 45:37.609
I know that the Korean government
is also very powerful.

45:38.652 --> 45:40.946
Now that the police got involved,

45:41.029 --> 45:42.781
Let's see how everything turns out.

45:50.622 --> 45:53.000
Why are you trying so hard?

46:02.468 --> 46:06.764
Because I trust my boss.

46:09.683 --> 46:12.686
You value trust too, don't you?

46:14.062 --> 46:17.065
We are equal.
Trust is our priority.

46:17.858 --> 46:21.904
Especially in this deal.

46:23.739 --> 46:24.907
What do you think

46:26.116 --> 46:27.242
of this madman?

46:30.120 --> 46:31.371
He seems loyal.

46:36.752 --> 46:38.045
He seems like a good guy.

46:51.141 --> 46:52.184
Hola.

46:52.768 --> 46:54.520
I want to speak to room 608.

46:56.480 --> 46:58.190
-Hello.
-This is Miss Lee.

46:58.982 --> 46:59.983
Hola.

47:02.319 --> 47:03.570
Should I decide today?

47:19.086 --> 47:20.838
I'll take a few days to think.

47:39.022 --> 47:40.858
It's been a while since I've been to Korea.

47:43.318 --> 47:45.153
I want to go out for a walk.

47:49.366 --> 47:50.951
And let's see properties.

47:52.536 --> 47:55.998
Maybe I should stop
sneaking money into China.

47:56.915 --> 47:58.500
You are likely to invest here.

48:02.379 --> 48:04.006
I'll need a tour guide.

48:09.219 --> 48:10.470
I guess you can't, right?

48:12.264 --> 48:14.725
You hit a police officer,
you shouldn't draw attention to yourself.

48:23.775 --> 48:24.776
Â¿Hola?

48:25.819 --> 48:27.738
Are you with Miss Lee?

48:29.448 --> 48:30.699
Yeah.

48:39.166 --> 48:40.375
Sr. Lee.

48:41.668 --> 48:43.587
How impatient.

48:43.670 --> 48:45.297
I didn't expect him to call so soon.

48:45.631 --> 48:47.799
The boss gave me

48:48.342 --> 48:49.676
a message.

48:50.260 --> 48:53.889
He says he will accept
the decision you make.

48:54.222 --> 48:57.643
But no matter what your decision,

48:58.352 --> 49:03.023
wants to suspend this deal for now.

49:03.106 --> 49:07.277
And as for the
police interruption during the meeting,

49:07.361 --> 49:08.695
he is furious.

49:08.779 --> 49:10.614
The police didn't come for this.

49:10.697 --> 49:12.532
Whatever the reason,

49:12.824 --> 49:16.203
He came for you, didn't he?

49:16.411 --> 49:19.790
Only when everything is safe again

49:20.749 --> 49:23.293
We will resume the deal.

49:23.752 --> 49:24.962
Miss Lee.

49:25.462 --> 49:28.382
I hope you make a sensible decision.

49:32.427 --> 49:33.720
Damn!

49:45.816 --> 49:47.359
Mr. Jung, can we talk?

50:19.307 --> 50:22.019
Without customers, there is no point in producing.

50:24.479 --> 50:27.232
That will weigh on my decision.

50:30.819 --> 50:32.320
What can I do to help her?

50:32.487 --> 50:34.031
Can not do nothing.

50:36.408 --> 50:40.704
His Japanese father thinks he is a king.

50:54.051 --> 50:56.970
Assault on a police officer
and obstruction of justice.

51:00.182 --> 51:03.018
Will you have gray hair when you get out of prison?

51:04.644 --> 51:07.647
I will also see you with gray hair.

51:13.570 --> 51:14.863
If everything goes well,

51:15.864 --> 51:18.033
I want you to be my tour guide.

51:29.544 --> 51:31.421
-Odd.
-Curse.

51:44.935 --> 51:46.228
Who are you?

51:46.311 --> 51:47.854
I can help?

51:47.938 --> 51:49.106
We are police.

51:52.234 --> 51:54.361
Jung Gicheul is back, right?

51:58.532 --> 52:00.450
Â¡Gicheul!

52:00.534 --> 52:02.244
Come out while I ask you nicely.

52:04.287 --> 52:05.372
What the fuck?

52:05.455 --> 52:07.624
Â¡SeÃ±or!

52:07.749 --> 52:09.626
What the fuck is happening?

52:09.709 --> 52:11.294
Can you come see the cameras?

52:11.545 --> 52:13.922
If you are going to investigate,
bring a warrant.

52:14.965 --> 52:16.299
Like I always say,

52:17.217 --> 52:19.386
these subordinates never listen.

52:27.227 --> 52:28.812
Sons of bitches.

52:29.187 --> 52:30.647
Here they come.

52:30.730 --> 52:32.065
-Did they close the door?
-That?

52:32.190 --> 52:34.651
-The door.
-Close the door, idiots!

52:40.365 --> 52:41.658
Â¿"Industria Gangnam"?

52:42.117 --> 52:43.535
Of course.

52:47.747 --> 52:50.083
Open. Police.

52:53.587 --> 52:55.589
Police. Open!

52:55.672 --> 52:57.841
What do we do, sir?

52:58.049 --> 52:59.718
We did not commit any crime.

52:59.801 --> 53:00.760
-I'm sorry
-Did we do it?

53:00.844 --> 53:02.179
Aside.

53:03.096 --> 53:03.972
Bad births.

53:04.055 --> 53:05.265
Hey!

53:07.100 --> 53:08.518
Aren't they going to open?

53:10.562 --> 53:13.273
I'll give you three seconds.

53:16.276 --> 53:17.527
Three.

53:19.905 --> 53:21.323
Of the!

53:21.406 --> 53:22.782
Sons of bitches.

53:23.783 --> 53:27.329
One! Open the door, idiots!

53:31.374 --> 53:32.375
The fucking mother.

53:33.668 --> 53:37.005
Bad fucking births!

53:37.088 --> 53:38.715
Open!

53:39.341 --> 53:41.051
Open up, motherfuckers!

53:41.843 --> 53:43.094
Damn!

53:45.931 --> 53:48.516
Damn.

53:48.892 --> 53:50.810
Bad births!

53:52.520 --> 53:53.605
The fucking mother!

53:55.649 --> 53:56.983
Fools.

53:59.903 --> 54:02.447
What do you think it does?

54:05.158 --> 54:08.495
He looks like a construction worker.

54:12.374 --> 54:16.419
Being a police officer does not give you the right to act like that.

54:17.837 --> 54:19.089
Shit.

54:23.385 --> 54:25.762
A police officer can act like that, son of a bitch.

54:26.012 --> 54:27.138
That...?

54:27.222 --> 54:29.015
Enough, brutes.

54:30.225 --> 54:33.561
Back. Get in line.

54:33.645 --> 54:37.065
-Curse.
-In line, I said! Move!

54:38.566 --> 54:39.734
Where is Jung Gicheul?

54:40.151 --> 54:42.112
I said he's not here.

54:45.073 --> 54:46.866
So, call him.

54:46.950 --> 54:48.827
We don't know where he went.

54:52.914 --> 54:55.500
Call him on his cell phone, idiot.

54:55.667 --> 54:58.670
He didn't give us his phone number.

55:00.046 --> 55:01.006
What the fuck?

55:02.716 --> 55:03.633
He

55:03.717 --> 55:04.718
didn't give you

55:04.801 --> 55:06.511
his phone number?

55:06.594 --> 55:08.346
So,

55:08.430 --> 55:10.598
Do you deserve some slaps?

55:10.682 --> 55:11.766
Fool!

55:11.850 --> 55:13.268
Do you deserve some slaps?

55:13.351 --> 55:15.437
A few?

55:15.520 --> 55:16.813
That you say?

55:16.896 --> 55:18.189
Is that right, son of a bitch?

55:22.569 --> 55:23.653
Hey!

55:24.404 --> 55:27.032
I guess you don't
know his phone number either.

55:28.616 --> 55:29.868
I will help you

55:32.454 --> 55:34.164
to remember

55:34.581 --> 55:35.623
GOOD.

55:36.374 --> 55:37.375
Understood.

55:39.919 --> 55:42.964
They destroyed the office and left.

55:43.423 --> 55:45.508
-What do we do?
-The fucking mother.

55:45.592 --> 55:47.969
Why Hwang Mingoo,
who is a fucking lunatic?

55:49.220 --> 55:50.263
SEO Boss.

55:50.347 --> 55:51.931
Call emergency contacts

55:52.015 --> 55:54.225
and tell them to close the premises
and not show their heads.

55:54.642 --> 55:55.769
All the premises?

55:56.811 --> 55:58.855
Do what I tell you, you bastard.

55:59.022 --> 56:00.357
I will surrender.

56:01.566 --> 56:03.068
That?

56:03.151 --> 56:05.945
Someone needs to take responsibility
and resolve this.

56:06.571 --> 56:08.073
I caused this problem,

56:08.448 --> 56:10.450
so I'll put an end to it anyway.

56:18.083 --> 56:19.376
Understanding, Kwon Seungho.

56:19.459 --> 56:20.877
Unfortunate.

56:22.003 --> 56:24.881
Do you think I'll let you go to jail?

56:25.298 --> 56:26.299
Boss.

56:27.258 --> 56:28.760
I will put an end to this

56:28.843 --> 56:30.970
so nothing bad happens
to you or the company.

56:36.267 --> 56:37.310
In return...

56:41.106 --> 56:42.774
If I can make everything calm down,

56:45.985 --> 56:47.612
I want you to do me a favor.

56:53.743 --> 56:56.204
Business with Japan and China.

56:57.247 --> 56:58.957
I want to participate.

57:02.502 --> 57:04.337
I'll go finish this.

57:11.010 --> 57:13.805
Answer me now, you bad boy.

01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:44.432
