ADMISSION TICKET
TITLE: SONAGI

00:59.184 --> 01:00.185
What is this?

01:00.477 --> 01:01.978
Do you have time this weekend?

01:02.062 --> 01:03.563
Let's go watch a movie.

01:05.231 --> 01:06.691
I have something for you.

01:07.108 --> 01:08.485
What?

01:09.360 --> 01:10.612
What is this?

01:13.948 --> 01:15.658
I bought it because I liked it.

01:15.742 --> 01:16.743
Is beautiful.

01:19.370 --> 01:22.248
Euijeong, Gicheul. Look here.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.501
There's no need to.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.169
Next. Let's do one.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.463
One two Three.

01:29.339 --> 01:31.966
Can you do one more thing?

01:32.050 --> 01:33.510
So that we both have our own.

01:33.593 --> 01:37.055
Gicheul. You don't even try to hide it.

01:38.556 --> 01:39.557
One two...

01:39.641 --> 01:40.725
Wait a minute.

01:42.685 --> 01:43.770
I'll strap it on for you.

01:46.064 --> 01:47.565
-Please.
-Thanks.

01:49.192 --> 01:51.444
One two Three.

01:54.405 --> 01:55.490
One more thing?

01:57.033 --> 01:57.867
Come closer.

02:01.996 --> 02:02.914
Ready?

02:05.416 --> 02:07.752
ABSOLUTE EVIL

02:07.836 --> 02:09.629
One two Three.

02:17.512 --> 02:20.014
I haven't seen Junmo in a long time.

02:21.349 --> 02:23.351
He's very busy.

02:23.434 --> 02:25.311
Why? You miss him?

02:25.562 --> 02:27.605
Of course.

02:27.689 --> 02:30.066
He's my only son-in-law.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.318
I'll tell him to check here.

02:33.820 --> 02:36.531
Tell him to go
on TV shows

02:36.614 --> 02:38.366
like other detectives do.

02:38.867 --> 02:41.744
I also want to brag about my son-in-law,
like other ladies here.

02:45.290 --> 02:48.168
Mom, do you remember that kid

02:48.251 --> 02:51.379
Jung Gicheula, from my church choir?

02:52.380 --> 02:54.257
Of course.

02:54.340 --> 02:56.092
Apparently he became a gangster.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.553
Did you know about that too?

02:59.137 --> 03:01.222
Living in one place for 20 years,

03:01.306 --> 03:03.057
you hear different things.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.812
I can't believe he ended up like this.

03:26.539 --> 03:29.334
Stop taking photos! There are children here.

03:29.584 --> 03:31.920
It's too cruel.

03:32.003 --> 03:33.421
Good heavens!

03:33.504 --> 03:34.422
Damned writers!

03:35.798 --> 03:37.884
Is Gicheul finishing school already?

03:37.967 --> 03:39.219
No, he's just getting started.

04:31.437 --> 04:33.481
BIO - KWON SEUNGHO

04:33.940 --> 04:35.650
"Kwon Seungho".

04:36.276 --> 04:38.486
FACT CHECK
CHECK YOUR FATHER'S RECORD

04:42.824 --> 04:44.409
YU EUIJEONG
DEPARTMENT SAFETY?

04:44.492 --> 04:46.911
A POLICEMAN'S WIFE?
NAME, PHOTO, DEPARTMENT

04:50.832 --> 04:51.916
„Yu Euijeong”.

04:53.626 --> 04:54.794
A photo of your husband?

05:03.094 --> 05:05.763
I said it was
about my father's arrest

05:05.847 --> 05:07.515
and they didn't pursue the topic.

05:07.598 --> 05:09.225
But I'm not sure,

05:09.309 --> 05:11.019
whether they believed me or not.

05:14.814 --> 05:16.190
By the way,

05:19.152 --> 05:23.698
Were you and Jung Gicheul
close?

05:23.781 --> 05:25.783
For a while in high school.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.577
I haven't seen him since then.

05:28.244 --> 05:30.163
-Why do you ask?
-It's nothing.

05:30.246 --> 05:32.248
I'll call you later.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.042
Don't worry.

05:35.251 --> 05:36.419
All right.

05:42.550 --> 05:45.011
Sorry we didn't mention
Detective Park.

05:45.094 --> 05:46.804
Safety considerations.

05:47.055 --> 05:50.099
Dohyung, I'm disappointed in you.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.060
How do you, of all people,

05:52.143 --> 05:54.854
Could you involve Junmo
in such a dangerous operation?

05:54.937 --> 05:56.731
I do not understand this.

05:56.814 --> 05:58.649
I'm sorry, Euijeong.

05:58.733 --> 06:00.068
I'm so sorry,

06:00.151 --> 06:02.570
but this is something
only Junmo can do.

06:02.653 --> 06:03.696
Dohyung.

06:10.286 --> 06:11.746
YOUNG GICHEUL

06:11.829 --> 06:14.957
Jung Gicheul found out
that Junmo and I know each other.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.210
He also knows I'm a cop.

06:17.293 --> 06:20.338
Are you really going to keep him there?

06:20.421 --> 06:25.259
For now, we should wait
for Jung Gicheul's next move.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.762
I'll keep an eye on him

06:27.845 --> 06:29.555
-so don't worry.
-Dohyung.

06:29.639 --> 06:32.683
You know Junmo much better than I do.

06:32.767 --> 06:35.144
Once he starts something, he will never give up.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.312
Inspector Yu.

06:37.313 --> 06:40.149
You want Detective Park
to close this case quickly

06:40.233 --> 06:41.567
and he came home, right?

06:42.860 --> 06:46.030
To make this happen,
we need your help.

06:46.114 --> 06:47.490
Sir, no.

06:49.450 --> 06:50.952
I would be very grateful.

07:06.426 --> 07:10.138
Did you really have to tell me
to come to the office at the crack of dawn?

07:11.556 --> 07:14.392
Please. Share with your people.

07:14.475 --> 07:15.768
These are American donuts.

07:16.853 --> 07:17.687
Hold.

07:27.989 --> 07:29.323
Thanks for the sweets.

07:29.407 --> 07:30.616
No problem. Enjoy your meal.

07:34.537 --> 07:35.872
Good morning sir.

07:35.955 --> 07:36.789
Hi.

08:00.813 --> 08:02.648
Kwon Seungh's father, Kwon Jangseok,

08:02.732 --> 08:06.027
he was convicted four times
for violating the drug law.

08:06.235 --> 08:07.862
As for his schools,

08:07.945 --> 08:09.280
I'll check it out in Wonju.

08:10.990 --> 08:14.076
Yu Euijeong's father
is the former commander of APMS,

08:14.160 --> 08:16.287
Yu Dukhoon.
Retired since last year.

08:17.288 --> 08:20.875
Her mother is undergoing cancer treatment
at Yeongdong Severance Hospital.

08:23.377 --> 08:24.712
He's in the Security Department,

08:24.795 --> 08:27.924
and her husband is a detective
at Eumseong Police Station.

08:28.007 --> 08:29.300
I have a picture of him here.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.154
Kwon Seungho.

09:09.549 --> 09:10.925
When you met Euijeong,

09:12.301 --> 09:13.886
did she mention her husband?

09:14.470 --> 09:15.513
NO.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.941
“Eumseong Police,
Criminal Affairs Department.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.360
Senior Officer Park Junmo.”

09:48.170 --> 09:51.048
EUMSEONG POLICE STATION
DETECTIVE PARK JUNMO

09:52.216 --> 09:53.759
Have you seen him before?

09:56.012 --> 09:56.929
NO.

09:57.138 --> 09:58.514
Take a good look.

09:59.515 --> 10:01.017
You saw him?

10:03.352 --> 10:05.563
I have not seen.

10:06.564 --> 10:07.940
Say.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.777
Who is more handsome? Me or him?

10:14.113 --> 10:15.114
You, boss.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.244
Let's go wash up.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.121
Yes sir.

10:25.708 --> 10:26.709
Something else.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.839
Is Euijeong from Wonju?

10:34.884 --> 10:40.306
From what I know, she moved there
because of her father's job.

10:40.389 --> 10:43.768
Then, when she was in middle school,
she returned to Seoul.

10:51.067 --> 10:55.988
You didn't know that the police intranet
saves your search history,

10:56.072 --> 10:58.199
when you log in to the system?

10:59.325 --> 11:00.826
I knew.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.828
Then how could you be so reckless

11:03.120 --> 11:04.705
to sell this information?

11:04.789 --> 11:06.040
I'm sorry, sir.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.501
I know your children
haven't gotten married yet.

11:09.543 --> 11:12.463
-Do you want to get into the newspapers?
-No, sir.

11:15.716 --> 11:18.928
From today you will do
what I tell you.

11:19.011 --> 11:23.015
If you keep up, I'll turn a blind eye to it.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.768
But if you mess up even a little,

11:25.851 --> 11:27.645
you're going straight to jail.

11:27.812 --> 11:29.271
Yes Sir.

11:29.605 --> 11:31.399
You can go now.

11:31.482 --> 11:33.150
And always answer my phone.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.787
And he thinks he's the boss.

11:45.538 --> 11:49.625
If it weren't for the prior preparations,
we would have had problems.

11:49.750 --> 11:50.751
Right.

11:53.212 --> 11:56.132
After he scammed the Busan thugs
at a rock club

11:56.215 --> 11:59.260
and did a background check
right after meeting Inspector Yu,

11:59.468 --> 12:03.764
it seems that Jung Gicheul is smarter
and more meticulous than I thought.

12:05.099 --> 12:07.685
Let's see who is smarter.

12:08.352 --> 12:09.520
How?

12:12.732 --> 12:14.442
Let's pick up the pace.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.569
How?

12:22.575 --> 12:25.953
By the way, where do you go
during the day instead of sleeping?

12:26.370 --> 12:29.457
I ride the subway and sleep on the seats.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.584
It helps me sleep.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.711
Don't say things like that.

12:33.794 --> 12:35.212
I feel bad about it now.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.505
That's not the point.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.216
Everyone does what they like.

12:41.260 --> 12:42.928
That actually sounds pretty cool.

12:43.012 --> 12:45.973
Why did you start working here?

12:46.348 --> 12:48.893
Because I wanted to have my life combed.

12:48.976 --> 12:51.395
The world will end in 1999 anyway.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.189
Nostadamus predicted so.

12:53.272 --> 12:54.398
Was that the guy's name?

12:59.403 --> 13:01.864
I'm going to have four awesome years

13:01.947 --> 13:05.284
and I will watch the world end.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.453
What is?

13:07.536 --> 13:11.832
Za bardzo trącę Pokoleniem X?

13:12.917 --> 13:15.753
Czemu ludzie w tym aucie mają maski?

13:16.504 --> 13:18.881
To cholernie podejrzane.

13:20.049 --> 13:21.634
-Co nie?
-Co oni robią?

13:22.051 --> 13:23.135
Po co mają maski?

13:33.062 --> 13:34.021
Co za bydlak.

13:35.981 --> 13:37.316
Szlag!

14:06.554 --> 14:07.930
Dorwać Jung Gicheula!

14:08.013 --> 14:10.683
-Hej!
-Jung Gicheul, ty bydlaku!

14:10.766 --> 14:12.351
-Wyłaź!
-Gdzie Jung Gicheul?

14:12.726 --> 14:14.895
Wychodź, palancie!

14:15.229 --> 14:16.564
Wyłaź stamtąd!

14:25.364 --> 14:26.282
Wyłączone światła.

14:27.032 --> 14:28.659
Co to za dupki?

14:30.244 --> 14:31.203
Szef jest w środku.

14:37.293 --> 14:38.544
Kurwa.

14:40.838 --> 14:43.048
Szefie, atakują nas.

14:43.132 --> 14:44.174
Weź go ze sobą.

14:44.258 --> 14:45.342
Szefie, chodź ze mną.

14:47.261 --> 14:48.846
-Szefie!
-Tam jest!

14:53.142 --> 14:54.184
Dorwać Jung Gicheula!

14:54.268 --> 14:55.644
Ja jestem Jung Gicheul!

14:57.563 --> 14:58.689
Chodź tu, sukinsynu!

15:01.442 --> 15:02.443
No chodź!

15:40.648 --> 15:42.066
Chyba wszyscy uciekli.

15:50.282 --> 15:51.325
Szefie, jesteś cały?

15:51.951 --> 15:52.952
A ty?

15:53.452 --> 15:54.286
Tak.

15:56.163 --> 15:58.749
Co za skurwysyny.

16:02.294 --> 16:05.089
PRZYCHODNIA LEKARSKA SEONGMO

16:05.381 --> 16:07.049
-Daj mi papierosa.
-Tak jest.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.472
-Ja też chcę.
-Proszę.

16:26.318 --> 16:27.444
Boli?

16:28.278 --> 16:29.863
Nie, wszystko w porządku.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.156
To tylko draśnięcie.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.329
Co robimy z tym gnojem, Song Donghyukiem?

16:37.413 --> 16:39.415
Bo jeśli nic, będzie nas miał za tchórzy.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.751
Może pojedźmy do Busan
i zetrzyjmy ich w proch.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.211
Ja się tym zajmę.

16:52.970 --> 16:55.055
Proszę pilnować, by rana była sucha.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.433
-Szwy zdejmiemy za tydzień.
-Doktorze.

17:06.900 --> 17:07.901
Dobra robota.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.030
Zrobiłem tylko to, co należało.

17:13.699 --> 17:17.119
Od jutra w pokoju obok

17:17.202 --> 17:19.580
będzie czuwał szef Seo.
Przepraszam, szefie.

17:22.416 --> 17:23.834
Ja jestem Jung Gicheul!

17:27.171 --> 17:28.505
Chcę przy sobie Seungho.

17:34.762 --> 17:38.015
Szefie, on dopiero co do nas dołączył.

17:38.807 --> 17:41.685
Sądzisz, że inni chłopcy tego nie zauważą?

17:45.981 --> 17:50.110
I nie możemy trzymać blisko ciebie gościa,
który zadaje się z glinami.

17:50.194 --> 17:52.488
A gdzie byłeś ty albo inni członkowie,

17:53.822 --> 17:55.491
gdy działo się to wszystko?

17:57.826 --> 17:59.286
Powiedz.

18:00.829 --> 18:02.206
Rób, co mówię.

18:04.124 --> 18:05.125
Tak, szefie.

18:17.012 --> 18:18.180
-Yongdae, spocznij.
-Tak.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.600
Załatw mu telefon.

18:21.683 --> 18:23.352
-Tak jest.
-Hej.

18:23.435 --> 18:24.436
Tak?

18:24.520 --> 18:25.729
I nowy garnitur.

18:26.230 --> 18:27.231
Tak jest.

18:27.314 --> 18:29.149
Wygląda jak bezdomny.

18:29.441 --> 18:30.567
Sobie też kup.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.111
Tak...

18:32.194 --> 18:33.278
Tak jest! Dziękuję!

18:51.964 --> 18:55.384
Dohyung. Nasz plan się powiódł.

18:56.802 --> 19:00.430
Tak. Od teraz będę
jego osobistym ochroniarzem.

19:01.306 --> 19:02.307
Dobrze.

19:02.391 --> 19:03.392
Przy okazji,

19:03.475 --> 19:05.519
uważam, że byłoby lepiej,

19:06.645 --> 19:10.065
gdybyś nie mówił innym,
że Jung Gicheul miał broń.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.985
Dobra. Dzięki za cały twój wysiłek.

19:13.068 --> 19:14.361
A wtedy ten wielki gość...

19:16.655 --> 19:18.031
-Dobry wieczór.
-Dobry wieczór.

19:18.115 --> 19:19.867
Świetna robota. Usiądźcie.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.076
Gładko zaczęliście.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.579
Zatrzymaliście się obok ich auta
w idealnym momencie.

19:23.704 --> 19:26.415
Ale ten koleś był naprawdę niezły.

19:26.498 --> 19:27.833
Udawał, że nas uderzał,

19:27.916 --> 19:29.668
ale trafiał w ścianę albo podłogę.

19:29.793 --> 19:32.671
Na udzie mam tylko siniaka. Niesamowite.

19:32.754 --> 19:34.590
Czym on się zajmował?

19:34.673 --> 19:37.801
To tylko zbir. Zwykły kapuś.

19:37.885 --> 19:38.886
Smacznego.

19:38.969 --> 19:39.845
Dziękujemy.

19:42.556 --> 19:43.390
Tak jest.

19:43.932 --> 19:45.184
W porządku.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.188
Człowieku, nie tam. Tutaj.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.524
-Widzisz tamten pokój?
-Tak.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.902
Łóżko nad sofą jest twoje. Dobra?

19:54.985 --> 19:56.278
Tak jest.

19:56.361 --> 19:57.487
Za mną.

20:00.991 --> 20:02.659
Biuro ma zamek na kod.

20:02.743 --> 20:03.577
Dobrze.

20:07.122 --> 20:08.123
Jeden, dwa, zero, sześć.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.541
Data moich urodzin.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.628
Co? Nie pasuje ci coś?

20:13.212 --> 20:15.255
Nie, proszę pana. Zapamiętam go.

20:16.798 --> 20:18.008
Tylko zastanawiam się...

20:19.676 --> 20:21.803
Co z innymi kodami w drzwiach...

20:21.887 --> 20:24.806
Boże, jeszcze więcej pytań.

20:26.183 --> 20:27.726
-Słuchaj.
-Tak jest.

20:27.935 --> 20:30.103
To jedyny kod, który powinieneś znać.

20:30.938 --> 20:32.064
Tak jest.

21:05.430 --> 21:08.684
Cześć, tu Seungho. Jak tam sprawy?

21:09.768 --> 21:12.646
Tak, u mnie w porządku.

21:13.355 --> 21:15.774
Dostałem telefon.

21:20.779 --> 21:24.116
Even if they check your chat history,

21:24.199 --> 21:26.827
will turn a blind eye to conversations with "Euijeong".

21:27.160 --> 21:29.997
Call this number from now on.

21:35.252 --> 21:37.170
You said your father beat you.

21:37.421 --> 21:38.505
Yes sir.

21:38.588 --> 21:39.589
Was he addicted to meth?

21:39.798 --> 21:40.799
So.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.677
It must have been hard for your mother.

21:44.469 --> 21:46.179
She left when I was seven.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.350
People like us have similar stories.

21:51.768 --> 21:53.729
What was it like seeing her after such a long time?

21:54.396 --> 21:56.773
What do you mean...

21:56.857 --> 21:59.401
Is Euijeong
still laid-back and cool?

22:00.694 --> 22:01.695
So.

22:01.778 --> 22:04.990
She should have married a rich man
and lived comfortably.

22:05.365 --> 22:08.076
Why did she marry
an ordinary village detective?

22:12.748 --> 22:13.749
Come with me.

22:17.419 --> 22:19.379
I'm going out for a while.

22:19.463 --> 22:21.048
Eat dinner without me.

22:21.673 --> 22:22.883
Hello.

22:23.717 --> 22:25.427
Where are you going?

22:25.510 --> 22:27.429
The threat may not have passed yet.

22:27.512 --> 22:30.307
We're not done with those bastards from Busan yet .

22:30.390 --> 22:32.267
It would be risky to separate.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.311
See you.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.188
Boss.

22:38.148 --> 22:42.069
We ordered food.
Maybe we can talk over dinner?

22:46.114 --> 22:48.075
-See you.
-See you later, boss.

23:05.133 --> 23:06.593
Can I ask where we're going?

23:07.594 --> 23:08.678
Do Yeongdong Severance.

23:14.142 --> 23:19.314
SZPITAL YEONGDONG SEVERANCE
SZPITAL YEONGDONG SEVERANCE

23:24.569 --> 23:25.529
Let's go.

23:26.655 --> 23:28.907
Euijeong's mother is said to be very sick.

23:29.533 --> 23:30.575
We'll say hello.

23:32.828 --> 23:34.246
I will stay here.

23:34.329 --> 23:36.415
You lived next door to them.

23:36.498 --> 23:37.666
You should go too.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.627
She probably wouldn't remember me anyway.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.338
Plus she's sick.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.841
If I join,
she will feel awkward.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.677
Go. I'll wait here.

23:55.058 --> 23:59.020
YOKOHAMA, JAPAN

23:59.896 --> 24:02.899
Your painting skills
are amazing.

24:03.650 --> 24:06.236
I will definitely frame this painting

24:06.319 --> 24:08.780
and I will hang it in a visible place.

24:09.281 --> 24:10.866
By the way,

24:12.993 --> 24:14.578
with Jung Gicheul in Seoul...

24:15.829 --> 24:17.664
What is he doing?

24:24.379 --> 24:28.300
From what I know,
he invested in the bars there.

24:32.095 --> 24:36.266
Well, after we get rid of him,

24:36.349 --> 24:39.102
I plan to take Gangnam for myself.

24:39.269 --> 24:41.688
But it shouldn't harm my brother.

24:41.897 --> 24:43.231
Young Gicheul

24:43.982 --> 24:46.902
he treats Boss Kanemoto like a father.

24:47.986 --> 24:49.863
I suggest you revise this plan.

24:52.866 --> 24:55.035
We are righteous criminals.

24:55.118 --> 24:59.498
But this stray out of nowhere
has no respect for order or loyalty

24:59.581 --> 25:01.791
and is chasing money.

25:01.875 --> 25:07.255
Is there any other way?

25:09.508 --> 25:12.802
First of all, I've already decided.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.348
Secondly,

25:17.057 --> 25:18.892
If I make a decision, I implement it.

25:20.810 --> 25:25.065
Please convey
these words carefully to my brother.

25:26.983 --> 25:27.984
All right.

25:30.904 --> 25:32.531
So I will.

25:32.614 --> 25:35.325
Once you make a decision,
you must act on it

25:36.743 --> 25:38.328
so as not to regret anything.

25:41.748 --> 25:42.791
Oh well...

25:44.918 --> 25:47.379
Sometimes you let dogs in
and sometimes you let them out.

25:48.046 --> 25:49.047
Exactly.

25:55.887 --> 25:59.349
Oh my, it's cashmere.

26:00.141 --> 26:02.394
You didn't have to buy
such an expensive gift.

26:03.311 --> 26:06.648
Even on a short walk
you should feel warm in it.

26:06.773 --> 26:07.649
Mimo to...

26:08.441 --> 26:11.653
Gosh, but beautiful.

26:12.862 --> 26:15.532
Not only
is your son-in-law tall and handsome,

26:15.615 --> 26:18.618
but he also has a heart of gold.

26:22.122 --> 26:23.707
Is everything okay with your mom?

26:25.250 --> 26:26.543
So.

26:28.670 --> 26:32.340
What happened to her
certainly caused a stir in the church.

26:32.424 --> 26:33.925
Of course not.

26:35.635 --> 26:40.140
Your mother was
so devoted to our church.

27:00.994 --> 27:02.370
Gicheul.

27:02.454 --> 27:03.538
So?

27:03.622 --> 27:06.750
Couldn't you find another job?

27:08.209 --> 27:10.754
So you also think
I'm a gangster?

27:12.047 --> 27:15.634
There are always these rumors
about people in the night business.

27:15.717 --> 27:16.760
Gossip?

27:17.218 --> 27:18.345
So.

27:21.848 --> 27:23.975
What I do...

27:24.684 --> 27:26.811
It's like an association.

27:27.687 --> 27:30.565
When young people are
in the nightclub industry,

27:30.649 --> 27:32.901
many people start fights with them

27:32.984 --> 27:34.110
or looks down on them.

27:34.778 --> 27:37.197
I thought we should
help each other.

27:37.280 --> 27:38.990
That's why I started my company.

27:39.407 --> 27:42.243
So you're not doing any bad things?

27:42.661 --> 27:45.330
Of course not. No worries.

27:48.541 --> 27:49.626
Sorry.

27:52.504 --> 27:53.505
Halo.

28:01.930 --> 28:03.014
Yes, father.

28:04.933 --> 28:05.934
There's no other way.

28:07.102 --> 28:09.229
Please continue with your plan.

28:11.272 --> 28:12.440
All right.

28:15.860 --> 28:18.279
Kanemoto, what are you doing?

28:18.863 --> 28:20.907
Gicheul earns money for me,

28:20.990 --> 28:23.076
and you, bastard, want to kill him?

28:29.499 --> 28:31.209
Kanemoto...

28:34.212 --> 28:35.672
You bastards.

28:36.464 --> 28:37.716
Damn bastards.

28:38.883 --> 28:40.009
Step back, you motherfuckers!

28:40.218 --> 28:42.137
Hey, you. Drop the weapon.

28:42.220 --> 28:45.140
He's Japanese,
so he doesn't understand Korean.

28:45.390 --> 28:46.683
It's too dangerous.

28:47.642 --> 28:48.643
Shoot him.

29:09.122 --> 29:10.373
Kurdish.

29:23.678 --> 29:24.679
Song Donghyuk.

29:25.722 --> 29:27.515
His father took care of him.

29:29.225 --> 29:30.435
Co?

29:30.518 --> 29:32.395
I said I would take care of it. Do you remember?

29:34.856 --> 29:37.859
Petty old bastard. Serves him right.

29:42.322 --> 29:43.323
Good morning.

29:45.950 --> 29:47.952
-Newbie, come here.
-Yes Sir.

29:48.745 --> 29:50.371
I see you had a good sleep.

29:52.081 --> 29:53.958
Your skin is glowing.

29:54.292 --> 29:55.460
Cholera.

29:55.543 --> 29:56.711
How shiny it is.

29:57.587 --> 29:58.713
Come in, idiot.

30:00.006 --> 30:01.800
I don't sweat.

30:09.098 --> 30:10.517
-Did you pack everything?
-Yes.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.060
Everything packed.

30:17.148 --> 30:18.525
-Take it.
-Yes Sir.

30:25.490 --> 30:26.741
Take it.

30:31.704 --> 30:33.748
Today is a good day, assholes.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.792
-Company dinner.
-Yes Sir.

30:35.875 --> 30:37.585
-Understand?
-Yes Sir!

30:38.044 --> 30:39.546
We will do our best.

30:40.255 --> 30:41.297
Enjoy your meal.

30:41.381 --> 30:43.091
-Thank you.
-Thank you, boss.

30:43.550 --> 30:45.134
Sorry. Please.

30:48.638 --> 30:49.639
Enjoy your meal.

31:09.576 --> 31:10.743
Can I ask you something?

31:11.077 --> 31:15.331
How often does your boss go fishing?

31:16.791 --> 31:18.293
Several times a month.

31:19.210 --> 31:20.378
I see.

31:21.546 --> 31:23.965
What should I do when my boss is away?

31:24.883 --> 31:28.344
Why? Do you want to go on a date?

31:29.804 --> 31:31.472
Stay at the damn precinct.

31:31.598 --> 31:32.849
I'm going to have a drink.

31:33.516 --> 31:34.893
Call me if anything happens.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.982
What an asshole.

32:02.253 --> 32:03.630
How are the waves?

32:04.005 --> 32:05.089
Today is quiet.

32:19.437 --> 32:22.774
When the boss goes fishing,

32:23.149 --> 32:24.984
when does he usually come back?

32:25.526 --> 32:27.695
Sometimes he stays one night.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.405
Sometimes for two.

32:30.281 --> 32:31.491
He definitely won't come back today.

32:34.619 --> 32:36.371
It's late. You're not going to sleep?

32:36.913 --> 32:37.914
What's that to you?

32:39.248 --> 32:40.583
Sweep there.

32:43.711 --> 32:45.254
Let's go somewhere to drink.

32:45.338 --> 32:46.714
-Yes Sir.
-Yes Sir.

32:46.798 --> 32:48.257
Come on.

32:48.341 --> 32:50.468
The bastard is already drunk.

32:55.139 --> 32:56.015
Do you want to go too?

32:56.265 --> 32:57.558
NO.

32:58.226 --> 33:00.228
-Watch this place.
-Yes Sir.

33:00.311 --> 33:01.312
Have fun.

34:27.148 --> 34:28.608
BIRTHDAYS OF MEMBERS OF THE GANGNAM UNION

34:45.083 --> 34:46.459
Cholera.

34:58.012 --> 34:59.347
Euijeong's birthday.

35:08.773 --> 35:10.608
I don't sweat.

35:12.777 --> 35:14.153
Fucker.

35:37.844 --> 35:40.346
Nothing exceptional was found with Jung Gicheul ?

35:40.888 --> 35:41.931
Correct.

35:43.474 --> 35:45.977
But isn't that weird?

35:46.519 --> 35:50.148
The bastards go fishing
several times a month,

35:50.815 --> 35:53.276
but there is no fishing rod in the room.

35:54.110 --> 35:56.529
So he may not go fishing.

36:00.408 --> 36:03.327
I'll try to convince him
to take me on such a trip.

36:05.246 --> 36:06.789
METROPOLITAN POLICE, TOKYO

36:06.873 --> 36:08.499
Korean boss Song Donghyuk.

36:08.583 --> 36:10.668
According to our Korean sources

36:10.751 --> 36:12.587
may be involved in the meth trade.

36:12.712 --> 36:16.340
He landed in Japan on the 15th
at Narita Airport and is now missing.

36:16.424 --> 36:19.343
His papers were found
on the Miura Coast of Kanagawa.

36:19.427 --> 36:21.095
We suspect he died nearby

36:21.179 --> 36:23.306
and his body was thrown into the sea.

36:23.806 --> 36:24.849
From today

36:24.932 --> 36:26.893
we will focus on observation

36:26.976 --> 36:29.729
gangsters from Yoshioka-gumi
in Tokyo, Chiba and Kanagawa.

36:29.812 --> 36:30.855
Understood?

36:30.938 --> 36:31.939
-Yes Sir!
-Yes Sir!

36:49.457 --> 36:50.458
Hi.

37:00.343 --> 37:01.928
DRESSING ROOM

38:06.200 --> 38:07.660
Tomatoes.

38:07.743 --> 38:09.161
Gangnam Crystal.

38:12.248 --> 38:14.292
Is it really 99% pure?

38:14.375 --> 38:15.835
Spread the word.

38:15.918 --> 38:16.752
All right.

38:24.719 --> 38:26.012
I rach!

38:26.971 --> 38:28.014
And chop!

38:33.060 --> 38:34.562
What fun.

38:35.062 --> 38:37.356
-Turn down the gas?
-Turn down the gas.

38:38.482 --> 38:39.734
Don't kill me!

38:41.277 --> 38:42.153
I'm begging you!

38:47.658 --> 38:49.493
Please don't kill me!

38:49.577 --> 38:50.619
Stop.

38:54.290 --> 38:56.542
Whose goods were you selling until recently?

39:03.424 --> 39:04.717
Who could it be?

39:07.178 --> 39:08.679
This man.

39:10.639 --> 39:12.099
What are you selling now?

39:13.225 --> 39:14.477
The Gangnam Crystal?

39:36.916 --> 39:38.209
Who is your boss?

39:40.044 --> 39:41.462
I have to meet him.

39:45.424 --> 39:47.218
Come here. Raise your head.

39:47.301 --> 39:49.595
Keep it up and your mouth shut.

39:49.678 --> 39:51.180
Closed!

39:52.723 --> 39:56.268
Just a moment.

39:56.519 --> 39:58.771
Closed!

39:58.854 --> 40:00.064
The last blow.

40:10.282 --> 40:12.785
This huge flashlight is useless.

40:16.372 --> 40:19.917
Instead of hanging around all day,
you could have replaced the batteries.

40:37.518 --> 40:38.978
You didn't buy it, did you?

40:43.941 --> 40:46.110
Maybe those bastards in Busan dropped it

40:46.193 --> 40:48.028
when they attacked us in the office.

40:49.029 --> 40:51.949
Are you saying they were cops?

40:52.032 --> 40:53.200
Why would they do that?

40:55.077 --> 40:56.412
I don't know.

40:58.664 --> 41:00.499
The cops pretended to be thugs

41:00.583 --> 41:02.418
and destroyed our office?

41:03.794 --> 41:04.879
But why?

41:12.928 --> 41:14.054
Sorry.

41:16.682 --> 41:18.058
What's up?

41:18.142 --> 41:19.101
So.

41:21.770 --> 41:23.022
All right. Wait there.

41:31.447 --> 41:32.406
Smith.

41:32.531 --> 41:33.866
Yes, Manager Cho?

41:33.949 --> 41:35.326
Do you think he came alone?

41:36.118 --> 41:37.161
It looks.

41:37.953 --> 41:39.079
Wake up the Kid.

41:41.248 --> 41:44.502
-Cholera.
-Where is...

41:52.051 --> 41:54.094
-Get out of the car.
-Get the fuck out.

41:54.178 --> 41:56.597
Come on. Move your ass.

41:57.306 --> 41:58.557
Idiot.

42:06.148 --> 42:07.358
You have a nice watch.

42:08.692 --> 42:09.693
Right.

42:10.528 --> 42:11.737
Did you come here alone?

42:11.820 --> 42:12.905
So.

42:14.490 --> 42:15.491
Child.

42:16.700 --> 42:18.160
Hi. Hands.

42:18.911 --> 42:20.412
Let's see...

42:24.166 --> 42:25.668
Wait a minute.

42:25.751 --> 42:26.627
I just...

42:32.758 --> 42:35.678
We can't talk here.
Let's go to a secluded place.

42:40.641 --> 42:42.142
Sorry.

43:02.705 --> 43:05.249
We can't leave a dead body
at the elementary school.

43:06.834 --> 43:08.586
The children would be scared.

43:09.545 --> 43:10.546
True?

43:11.839 --> 43:13.048
You are right.

43:23.100 --> 43:24.101
Take him away.

43:36.697 --> 43:38.407
What a great watch.

43:38.490 --> 43:40.576
Man, I'm jealous!

43:44.913 --> 43:46.206
Damn it.

43:47.374 --> 43:49.710
Hold. Try it on.

43:50.628 --> 43:51.503
And how is it lying?

43:54.757 --> 43:55.758
What the hell is going on?

43:55.883 --> 43:57.009
What is he doing?

43:57.551 --> 43:59.053
Manager Cho.

43:59.136 --> 44:02.014
Hi! What the fuck are you doing?

44:07.186 --> 44:09.688
What the fuck?

44:10.314 --> 44:12.107
Child. Go check it out.

44:14.568 --> 44:16.362
My neck hurts.

44:17.112 --> 44:18.238
Go to hell!

44:26.497 --> 44:27.665
Hey, miss!

44:28.082 --> 44:31.877
Get out of the car! My neck was hurting!

44:31.960 --> 44:33.045
Miss!

44:34.672 --> 44:35.881
What?

44:39.635 --> 44:40.803
What the fuck?

44:41.387 --> 44:42.930
I can not see!

44:45.432 --> 44:46.517
Fight!

44:47.434 --> 44:49.561
You fucking...

45:18.173 --> 45:19.341
Kwon Seungho.

45:19.425 --> 45:20.592
So?

45:21.301 --> 45:22.302
Hello.

45:24.012 --> 45:24.972
Come with me.

45:27.182 --> 45:28.183
Come on.

45:58.255 --> 45:59.465
Hello.

45:59.548 --> 46:03.594
Who let you wear
such fancy pants, dickhead?

46:04.428 --> 46:05.763
You fucking bastard.

46:07.014 --> 46:08.140
Hello.

46:09.349 --> 46:10.517
Skurwysyn.

46:10.976 --> 46:12.311
Come on.

46:12.394 --> 46:13.896
Reply.

46:13.979 --> 46:14.980
Who's that?

46:16.064 --> 46:17.316
Hi.

46:19.443 --> 46:21.153
What an ass he is.

46:21.236 --> 46:22.654
He tried to kill the boss

46:22.738 --> 46:23.864
and ruin our business.

46:23.947 --> 46:25.449
What will we do with him?

46:28.076 --> 46:29.077
Zabijmy go.

46:29.369 --> 46:30.829
Which did not? Do you think so too?

46:32.539 --> 46:34.124
Ty sukinsynu.

46:37.795 --> 46:38.796
It is not you?

46:39.880 --> 46:41.256
So why are we doing this?

46:42.090 --> 46:43.967
You think there's no reason?

46:44.760 --> 46:46.595
-NO?
-Stop shaking, bitch.

46:48.055 --> 46:49.723
You son of a bitch.

46:49.807 --> 46:51.099
Raise your head.

46:51.183 --> 46:53.060
Fucking shit.

46:55.145 --> 46:56.146
Hold him.

46:59.566 --> 47:00.609
Hello.

47:00.692 --> 47:01.527
Come on.

47:01.610 --> 47:03.403
Raise your hands.

47:03.487 --> 47:04.571
Hold him tight.

47:04.655 --> 47:05.864
One two Three.

47:08.242 --> 47:10.661
And this was supposed to kill him?

47:10.744 --> 47:12.037
Then try it yourself.

47:12.120 --> 47:13.413
Do you like it or what?

47:13.747 --> 47:15.290
Then do it yourself, son of a bitch.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.085
Pick it up.

47:19.753 --> 47:21.296
I'll hit him here.

47:21.797 --> 47:22.631
Into this place.

47:26.260 --> 47:27.845
Jebana likes it.

47:31.765 --> 47:32.641
You son of a bitch.

47:33.892 --> 47:35.018
Don't tense up, bitch.

47:39.439 --> 47:42.234
This bitch deserves a spanking
for her nice underwear.

47:42.317 --> 47:43.318
Come here.

47:45.696 --> 47:46.780
Time to spank, bitch.

47:48.365 --> 47:49.408
Once.

47:50.701 --> 47:51.702
Two.

47:53.662 --> 47:55.497
Once again.

47:55.581 --> 47:58.125
-Three.
-Enough.

48:00.586 --> 48:02.254
Enough of this fun. We're finishing this.

48:03.797 --> 48:04.798
Yes sir.

48:22.816 --> 48:24.109
You finish it.

48:27.362 --> 48:28.780
So that I can trust you.

48:52.304 --> 48:53.305
Shoot him.

49:04.149 --> 49:05.150
Shoot.

49:07.319 --> 49:08.403
Cholera.

49:44.523 --> 49:45.607
Shoot!

49:49.236 --> 49:50.654
Fighting.

53:17.319 --> 53:19.321
