00:01.835 --> 00:08.717
PERSONS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

02:09.504 --> 02:16.427
THE WORST OF EVIL

02:20.473 --> 02:23.518
2 YEARS AGO, 1994
SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA

02:30.817 --> 02:32.193
- Hello.
- Hello.

02:33.903 --> 02:35.029
You best.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.657
Did you feel sorry for the street vendor again?

02:38.199 --> 02:40.618
No, I bought it because it tastes good.

02:40.702 --> 02:41.870
- It does.
- Yes.

02:43.246 --> 02:44.497
What's with the uniform?

02:44.581 --> 02:47.000
I told you,
I'm transferring to the security department.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.002
Was it today?

02:53.923 --> 02:55.175
Let us eat.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.095
She transfers to the security department,

02:59.179 --> 03:02.932
marking the official start
of her elite career.

03:03.808 --> 03:05.018
You know that, right?

03:05.101 --> 03:06.477
Yes of course.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.397
It is worth celebrating

03:09.480 --> 03:10.607
with the whole family.

03:11.649 --> 03:13.651
Your wife has been selected for Seoul

03:13.735 --> 03:15.862
and promoted to police assistant.

03:17.197 --> 03:20.116
Have you spoken to your father recently?

03:20.950 --> 03:22.869
No.

03:23.369 --> 03:25.747
Well, he's getting old,

03:25.830 --> 03:27.540
so he should pull himself together

03:27.624 --> 03:29.250
and live healthy.

03:30.251 --> 03:31.294
And.

03:32.128 --> 03:33.296
Okay.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.674
How are the preparations
for the promotion exam going?

03:36.758 --> 03:39.886
I should prepare,
but it's hard to find time.

03:39.969 --> 03:42.764
So give yourself time for it.

03:42.847 --> 03:45.183
Your wife is an elite cop.

03:45.266 --> 03:48.269
And you're just
a low-level detective.

03:48.770 --> 03:51.064
- What?
- Now stop that nonsense.

03:51.147 --> 03:52.023
Nonsense?

03:52.232 --> 03:55.026
Don't be so condescending.
As if you are much older.

03:55.109 --> 03:57.737
Your new title doesn't mean
you're mature.

03:57.820 --> 03:58.738
As I always say,

03:58.821 --> 04:01.950
if KNPU accepted women
when I applied to university,

04:02.033 --> 04:03.368
I would also be the boss now.

04:03.451 --> 04:04.285
Then that's enough.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.080
Enjoy your drink

04:08.039 --> 04:10.083
and stay as long as you want.

04:10.166 --> 04:12.293
I'm going to the hospital to visit your mother.

04:12.377 --> 04:13.836
- I'll drive you.
- No thank you.

04:14.295 --> 04:16.506
It didn't help you to close the case.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.384
If you wanted to go to Seoul,
you should have come to

04:19.467 --> 04:20.843
retirement ceremony,

04:20.927 --> 04:22.136
have socializedâ€¦

04:48.204 --> 04:49.914
My brothers are such idiots.

04:50.581 --> 04:52.000
We don't need to come again.

04:52.875 --> 04:54.836
I'd rather visit my mother
than come here.

04:58.548 --> 05:00.508
How's your mother? Is she okay?

05:01.801 --> 05:03.636
Yes, she's okay.

05:08.850 --> 05:12.228
Just forget what my father said about your father.

05:12.812 --> 05:14.314
I forgot about it too.

05:24.407 --> 05:26.492
It is from my church in high school.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.703
I should take it home.

05:38.629 --> 05:41.132
GANGNAM, SOUTH KOREA

05:41.215 --> 05:42.592
Come to our club!

05:43.092 --> 05:46.179
Come to All Night Club!
Free beer for the ladies.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.056
Stop. Damn.

05:48.139 --> 05:49.640
You bitch!

05:49.724 --> 05:51.976
Why aren't you working? Come here.

05:52.268 --> 05:53.603
- Hello.
- It's annoying.

05:53.978 --> 05:57.231
Friends, it's: "Come to the All Night Club."

05:57.315 --> 05:58.941
Are you there?

05:59.025 --> 06:00.526
Seriously, what are you doing?

06:00.985 --> 06:02.653
Want to make Gicheul go crazy?

06:02.737 --> 06:04.447
DJ CHEOLI

06:27.845 --> 06:29.097
Hey, Superstar Lee!

06:29.180 --> 06:30.181
Hey what's up?

06:30.515 --> 06:31.808
How are you?

06:31.891 --> 06:33.559
- Well?
- The girls are hot today.

06:33.976 --> 06:35.478
Just look.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.524
- Hello!
- He is so sweet!

06:44.529 --> 06:47.448
She was right in front of us!

07:10.596 --> 07:11.848
He stepped on me first!

07:13.141 --> 07:14.392
Hello.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.937
If you want to show muscle,
do it in your hometown.

07:18.020 --> 07:20.356
In Gangnam you clap and drink.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.734
If you don't want to die.

07:25.486 --> 07:28.448
Let's change the mood with something gentle.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.452
Okay. Let's lead these gentlemen outside.

07:36.205 --> 07:38.291
Next round.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.461
Rumor has it,

07:41.544 --> 07:43.296
that you were born and raised here,

07:43.379 --> 07:46.424
has a good network and can fight.

07:46.507 --> 07:48.301
So why do you work as a DJ?

07:51.929 --> 07:53.514
Let's work together.

07:54.891 --> 07:58.519
I want to work with
real locals from Gangnam.

07:59.437 --> 08:01.856
Why be a DJ in a nightclub,

08:01.939 --> 08:04.025
when you could own one?

08:05.443 --> 08:06.819
I can make it happen.

08:09.739 --> 08:10.740
Do you think so?

08:12.408 --> 08:14.535
When will you make me the owner?

08:15.620 --> 08:18.789
- Are you busy?
- I want to make money quickly.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.667
Are you poor?

08:22.251 --> 08:24.045
Do you think everyone in Gangnam is rich?

08:24.128 --> 08:25.963
You fucking rich.

08:26.047 --> 08:27.465
Speak nicely.

08:33.012 --> 08:34.430
Young Gicheul.

08:34.514 --> 08:39.060
If you get all your friends
to work here,

08:40.978 --> 08:42.438
I make you the owner.

08:43.439 --> 08:44.524
Does that sound good?

08:49.153 --> 08:50.488
Do I have your word?

08:51.906 --> 08:53.032
My word?

08:54.867 --> 08:56.077
Is that what you want?

08:56.410 --> 08:57.537
Is it?

09:11.926 --> 09:15.179
A YEAR LATER, 1995
GANGNAM, SOUTH KOREA

09:15.263 --> 09:16.722
- Hello, Mr.
- Hello.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.099
- Enjoy it.
- Yes.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.952
Good day, boss.

09:38.035 --> 09:39.036
Did you find her?

09:39.161 --> 09:41.205
It's Professor Yoon.

09:41.289 --> 09:43.457
I hear she's the best.

09:44.458 --> 09:45.501
Have you met her?

09:46.294 --> 09:49.672
Yes, but I was told
she is retired.

09:51.173 --> 09:53.175
Money can solve everything.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.304
Keep in touch with her.

09:56.387 --> 09:57.888
Bleach, boss.

10:07.481 --> 10:09.150
Gicheul!

10:10.359 --> 10:12.528
We need you down below.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.487
What happens?

10:13.571 --> 10:15.656
Pardon. Come down.

10:24.415 --> 10:26.834
Get up you damn bitch.

10:27.418 --> 10:29.503
- Hello.
- Seriously, stop!

10:37.595 --> 10:38.721
Vent...

10:38.804 --> 10:40.306
You little...

10:40.514 --> 10:41.682
Let go of me!

10:41.766 --> 10:43.142
You annoying bitch.

10:43.225 --> 10:45.061
Pour it up, I said!

10:45.144 --> 10:46.437
No, don't.

10:47.355 --> 10:48.773
He is from a rich family.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.067
Beat me.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.194
Hit me now, you pig.

10:53.277 --> 10:56.864
That idiot can't even beat me.

10:57.698 --> 10:59.241
Who are the losers?

11:01.243 --> 11:03.287
How dare you?

11:05.331 --> 11:06.415
Hey.

11:08.209 --> 11:09.627
Do you know who I am?

11:10.961 --> 11:13.547
Take them here and step.

11:16.926 --> 11:17.968
Step.

11:18.302 --> 11:20.638
Din nar.

11:27.144 --> 11:30.147
Do you think our boss brought you in
so you could do this?

11:30.481 --> 11:32.316
Your lousy DJ.

11:37.571 --> 11:38.698
Light my cigarette.

11:52.294 --> 11:54.922
And what's wrong with you?

11:55.005 --> 11:56.132
Are you Gen X or what?

11:57.550 --> 11:59.218
You and your stupid style.

12:00.219 --> 12:03.472
No one here will take you seriously
if you dress like that.

12:04.181 --> 12:05.141
Gicheul.

12:06.934 --> 12:09.937
You gotta get up, okay?

12:10.020 --> 12:11.021
Do you see...

12:11.605 --> 12:13.399
Your asshole...

12:15.067 --> 12:18.070
It seems
losers can have tempers too.

12:21.198 --> 12:24.493
A year has passed.
Can you keep your promise now?

12:30.875 --> 12:32.626
Damn it.

12:32.710 --> 12:36.130
Have some patience, you poor ass.

12:36.714 --> 12:40.926
If it's hard,
let me make money my own way.

12:41.010 --> 12:42.219
I know how

12:42.303 --> 12:44.597
we can all make a fortune.

12:44.805 --> 12:46.265
How then?

12:49.852 --> 12:50.895
Go.

12:55.816 --> 12:59.487
I have worked in the night life for a long time
and I know

12:59.570 --> 13:01.822
who distributes
marijuana and amphetamines.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.325
If we get the little ones out of the way

13:04.408 --> 13:05.993
and takes over the distribution,

13:06.076 --> 13:07.495
can we make good money.

13:09.288 --> 13:10.581
If you fund the plan,

13:10.664 --> 13:12.625
then I do the legwork.

13:12.708 --> 13:14.001
Are you asking me to

13:16.170 --> 13:18.005
to become a junkie?

13:18.088 --> 13:19.215
We only sell it.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.968
We just have to make sure
our boys stay clean.

13:24.637 --> 13:25.930
Bleach.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.224
Aha.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.270
You fucking rich.

13:33.896 --> 13:37.817
You are crazy.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.905
I am Korea's biggest boss
Song Donghyuk's right hand.

13:42.988 --> 13:44.824
And you say I have to sell drugs?

13:45.366 --> 13:48.619
Do you think I'm a lousy bully?

13:49.328 --> 13:51.497
I'm Sergeant Jang.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.583
Not a drug dealer.

13:54.667 --> 13:58.087
I'm the president of Gangnam,
Sergeant Jang, you idiot.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.798
Do you have a death wish or what?

14:01.882 --> 14:03.300
You there.

14:03.968 --> 14:06.387
Be careful what you say.

14:09.181 --> 14:10.599
I'm warning you.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.229
What an annoying guy.

14:30.119 --> 14:31.161
Jang, that pig.

14:31.245 --> 14:32.997
He promised us a Mercedes.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.374
Damn it!

14:36.250 --> 14:38.502
We're fucking rich
so he can treat us like shit.

14:38.752 --> 14:40.963
But he can't treat Gicheul like that.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.340
We are all here because of Gicheul.

14:43.424 --> 14:46.135
But those assholes don't respect him.

14:47.678 --> 14:48.762
Is your face okay?

14:49.471 --> 14:50.514
are you ok

14:53.058 --> 14:54.393
With living like this.

14:54.602 --> 14:56.478
We're okay, dammit.

14:57.271 --> 14:59.732
We were rooting for you no matter what.

14:59.815 --> 15:00.858
He is right.

15:00.941 --> 15:04.069
We would even follow you to Hell.

15:04.737 --> 15:07.448
We'd even dig up shit for you.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.533
It's sticky, you freak.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.917
Come on, let's do it.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.418
Do what?

15:19.501 --> 15:20.961
Damn it!

15:21.545 --> 15:24.173
- Hello.
- Honey, I'll be ready tomorrow.

15:24.256 --> 15:25.841
Let's do it tomorrow, okay?

15:25.925 --> 15:27.217
Treasure.

15:27.301 --> 15:29.011
I'll make you happy tomorrow.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.347
So just rest today, okay?

15:32.306 --> 15:34.808
Tomorrow you better...

15:50.532 --> 15:51.367
Damn bitch!

16:16.809 --> 16:17.977
Hey what's up?

16:18.060 --> 16:20.688
Your favorite hotel in Jeongseon for holidays.

16:21.105 --> 16:22.272
Is it in the mountains?

16:22.731 --> 16:25.067
Yes, it's in the middle of a forest.

16:25.150 --> 16:26.610
It has lots of fresh air.

16:29.738 --> 16:31.240
Give me their information.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.158
He killed a man in middle school

16:33.242 --> 16:34.743
and has been inside for five years.

16:36.036 --> 16:37.037
It's him.

16:44.586 --> 16:46.505
I already told him about us,

16:46.588 --> 16:48.424
so I'll let you two talk alone.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.676
RECRUIT KNIVES

16:51.468 --> 16:52.511
I am Jung Gicheul.

17:02.396 --> 17:03.814
You have something inside.

17:10.487 --> 17:11.739
You have something too.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.622
What can you do for me?

17:21.874 --> 17:23.250
Two clubs in Gangnam.

17:25.502 --> 17:26.503
Appointment.

17:27.546 --> 17:30.257
Let's exterminate those pigs

17:33.135 --> 17:34.803
and take over Gangnam.

17:40.642 --> 17:43.270
THE NEW JEONGSEON HOTEL

17:49.568 --> 17:50.527
Is it here?

18:00.996 --> 18:02.915
PRESIDENT JANG'S
TRIP FOR THE RELIEF ASSOCIATION

18:06.085 --> 18:08.295
- Eat up.
- Thank you sir.

18:10.589 --> 18:11.799
Hr. Jung Gicheul.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.135
You are terrible at football!

18:17.054 --> 18:19.473
It is okay. There is always a next time.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.684
You were really miserable.

18:23.435 --> 18:24.937
Enjoy the food, friends.

18:29.608 --> 18:30.901
Ten, Kwon Taeho.

18:31.485 --> 18:32.569
Year.

18:36.031 --> 18:37.616
Where is the owner?

18:37.783 --> 18:41.286
He said he wouldn't interrupt
and that we should enjoy ourselves.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.539
He will come tomorrow morning
to say hello.

18:44.748 --> 18:45.833
Bleach?

18:47.459 --> 18:48.418
By the way,

18:49.586 --> 18:51.213
why are there no other guests?

18:52.005 --> 18:54.133
He said that is normal in the off season.

18:54.716 --> 18:58.428
So the owner was
your middle school baseball coach?

18:58.512 --> 19:00.722
Yes, his family is very rich.

19:00.806 --> 19:03.392
He said if you like the place,

19:03.475 --> 19:05.686
he would like some help next year

19:05.769 --> 19:07.938
with the new hotel construction in Gangnam.

19:09.064 --> 19:11.483
Okay.
Say I'll keep it in the back of my mind.

19:11.692 --> 19:12.734
Bleach.

21:12.938 --> 21:13.772
Next.

21:15.899 --> 21:17.025
You assholes!

21:45.220 --> 21:46.054
Shit pigs!

21:50.767 --> 21:51.768
Before hell!

21:52.769 --> 21:56.898
You little rats! I'll kill you all!

22:01.028 --> 22:02.029
You assholes!

22:05.282 --> 22:06.116
Before hell!

22:09.286 --> 22:10.620
Shit pigs.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.586
You assholes!

22:17.669 --> 22:18.962
Move, you pig!

22:29.264 --> 22:31.224
What the hell is all this?

22:54.664 --> 22:58.835
Do people from Seoul never sleep at night?

23:01.671 --> 23:02.923
Kill them all.

23:03.632 --> 23:04.800
Wipe them out!

23:06.301 --> 23:07.969
Kill them all!

23:08.053 --> 23:09.346
Kill them!

23:42.712 --> 23:44.172
Skidrich!

24:12.367 --> 24:14.035
Chef!

24:16.580 --> 24:17.622
Chef!

24:20.834 --> 24:22.002
Chef!

24:35.557 --> 24:36.558
Damn it.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.149
Celebrate...

24:45.066 --> 24:45.901
Before hell!

25:00.248 --> 25:01.249
Come on!

25:34.115 --> 25:35.033
Okay.

25:36.117 --> 25:37.410
Fine.

25:38.578 --> 25:40.205
Before hell.

25:41.206 --> 25:42.499
So that's enough, okay?

25:43.375 --> 25:44.501
You can have Gangnam.

25:45.377 --> 25:46.628
Take it.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.672
I've taken care of things outside.

25:48.755 --> 25:50.840
Thanks. Then finish.

25:50.924 --> 25:52.175
Okay.

26:00.100 --> 26:02.435
What now?

26:02.519 --> 26:04.563
Fine.

26:09.693 --> 26:10.902
Get your hands off me.

26:10.986 --> 26:12.487
Hands off, I said.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.782
Move, you pig!

26:16.700 --> 26:17.534
You little...

26:20.954 --> 26:23.123
Hey, asshole.

26:23.206 --> 26:25.959
Do you have a death wish?

26:31.798 --> 26:34.175
Can't you see what's going on?

26:36.636 --> 26:38.013
Taeho, no. Do not!

26:39.764 --> 26:40.974
You fucking rich.

26:41.057 --> 26:42.892
I told you to get your hands off.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.312
- Taeho!
- You bastard.

26:46.688 --> 26:49.232
Let go, you pig!

26:49.316 --> 26:51.067
Let go of me, you asshole!

26:51.735 --> 26:54.529
I will kill you all.

26:56.114 --> 26:58.408
You are all dead now.

27:01.828 --> 27:04.164
My men from Busan are coming for you!

27:05.165 --> 27:06.166
In assholes.

27:09.919 --> 27:11.588
Give me the damn watch

27:11.671 --> 27:14.466
what dead pigs have.

27:15.050 --> 27:16.635
It's my damn watch, yourâ€¦

27:25.185 --> 27:26.436
I said...

27:33.318 --> 27:35.403
What...

27:35.987 --> 27:39.199
You fucking...

27:45.914 --> 27:47.290
Your damn...

27:47.374 --> 27:49.000
You miserable asshole!

27:49.084 --> 27:51.461
Die, you miserable asshole!

28:32.627 --> 28:35.797
BUSAN, SOUTH KOREA

28:39.759 --> 28:41.261
I am pleased, Mr.

28:41.344 --> 28:42.804
My name is Jung Gicheul.

28:43.930 --> 28:47.934
Sergeant Jang became blood brothers with
the Jaegeon group's Sung Kisoo recently.

28:48.226 --> 28:51.020
I overheard their conversation while they were drinking.

28:51.563 --> 28:53.314
He cuts all ties to Busan

28:53.398 --> 28:56.025
and will start over
under Sung Kisoo in Seoul.

28:57.485 --> 28:59.112
If you wouldn't believe me,

28:59.195 --> 29:00.447
I have taken a picture.

29:03.450 --> 29:06.411
It wouldn't be so complicated
if he were here.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.080
But I can't get hold of him.

29:14.919 --> 29:17.714
What did you do to him?

29:19.799 --> 29:22.677
Did you bury him on a mountain

29:22.802 --> 29:23.928
or...

29:26.389 --> 29:27.807
Did you throw him into the sea?

29:27.891 --> 29:30.435
While we brought him to Seoul,

29:30.518 --> 29:31.770
he suddenly ran away.

29:32.437 --> 29:34.731
We don't know where he is either.

29:34.814 --> 29:36.775
He killed his own family.

29:37.692 --> 29:40.236
I just came from the funeral.

29:41.279 --> 29:43.490
Whether he betrayed or killed someone,

29:43.573 --> 29:45.325
is he still one of mine

29:45.575 --> 29:48.953
If you wanted to get rid of him,
you should have asked for permission.

29:49.746 --> 29:52.999
It doesn't work the other way around.
It is wrong.

30:01.674 --> 30:02.842
And yet

30:03.843 --> 30:05.678
you came here of your own free will.

30:11.976 --> 30:13.311
What was your name?

30:13.394 --> 30:14.771
Young Gicheul.

30:15.897 --> 30:16.898
Young Gicheul.

30:19.609 --> 30:23.446
Jung Gicheul is A, an idiot,

30:23.530 --> 30:26.199
or B, a madman.

30:29.244 --> 30:32.372
What if there is a C?

30:34.707 --> 30:36.501
If you take me in,

30:37.460 --> 30:38.545
then I promise

30:38.628 --> 30:41.631
only taking Nonhyeon-dong
and Yeoksam-dong.

30:41.714 --> 30:43.091
And...

30:43.174 --> 30:46.010
I send you
50 million won every month.

30:46.094 --> 30:47.262
You have my word.

31:01.818 --> 31:04.612
Do you even know what you are talking about?

31:04.696 --> 31:06.865
If you send me
50 million every month,

31:07.949 --> 31:10.451
how will you pay your men?

31:41.733 --> 31:43.109
You must be Professor Yoon.

31:43.192 --> 31:45.528
Are you from
the prosecution or the police?

31:48.197 --> 31:50.575
I am the one
who sent you the travel guide to China.

32:06.466 --> 32:07.800
It came with some gold.

32:09.093 --> 32:10.762
My name is Jung Gicheul.

33:24.836 --> 33:27.213
SEOUL CENTRAL PROSECUTOR'S AUTHORITY

33:30.216 --> 33:31.217
Hello.

33:35.346 --> 33:38.933
I'm Murayama Hideaki. Tokyo Police,
Narcotics Control Division.

33:41.269 --> 33:44.355
Cho Changsik, Chief Prosecutor,
Serious Crime Division.

33:48.234 --> 33:50.278
- I am pleased.
- You too.

33:50.361 --> 33:53.156
When I said the drugs were too expensive,

33:55.658 --> 33:57.410
said the drug dealer

33:58.911 --> 34:00.038
that he gets the drugs

34:00.955 --> 34:04.459
fra yakuzaerne i Yoshioka-gumi,

34:04.542 --> 34:06.294
so he couldn't make it cheaper.

34:07.962 --> 34:12.300
Because the premium quality product
with 99% purity

34:12.717 --> 34:14.552
is imported from Korea.

34:15.803 --> 34:17.722
But just calm down.

34:18.473 --> 34:20.850
They say we are going to get

34:20.933 --> 34:23.186
over 10 kg every month from Korea.

34:23.311 --> 34:26.147
- "Over 10 kg every month from Korea."
- Of course it will

34:27.523 --> 34:29.609
result in a price drop.

34:29.692 --> 34:31.819
"This will naturally
result in a price drop."

34:33.821 --> 34:35.073
We let that drug dealer go

34:35.156 --> 34:37.241
in return for these statements,

34:37.325 --> 34:39.202
but he was murdered three days ago.

34:39.285 --> 34:42.288
We suspect it was revenge
from those in Yoshioka-gumi.

34:45.374 --> 34:47.418
Drug trade with Japan.

34:49.754 --> 34:52.006
It's probably a Korean gang.

34:54.133 --> 34:55.760
Getting the Korean Amphetamine Cook

34:55.843 --> 34:59.222
and the smuggler arrested is not enough.

34:59.305 --> 35:02.308
There are many
Yoshioka-gumi members throughout Japan.

35:02.391 --> 35:05.228
We must find out
which member in which part and region,

35:05.311 --> 35:07.063
that imports and distributes amf.

35:07.146 --> 35:08.981
And to ensure hard evidence,

35:09.315 --> 35:12.360
may we catch the smugglers in the act.

35:13.986 --> 35:15.113
Captured.

35:15.279 --> 35:17.740
Do you have someone who fits this case?

35:17.824 --> 35:19.033
EUMSEONG, SOUTH KOREA

35:19.117 --> 35:20.785
One who is tenacious.

35:20.868 --> 35:22.328
Which does not stick out.

35:22.787 --> 35:25.248
I know a guy.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.291
He's a little wild,

35:27.792 --> 35:28.751
men...

35:29.168 --> 35:30.628
He is perfect for the job.

35:33.214 --> 35:34.215
Your asshole.

35:35.299 --> 35:36.300
Let go of me!

35:37.844 --> 35:39.595
Don't interfere.

35:57.572 --> 35:58.698
So refreshing.

36:04.203 --> 36:05.955
Don't want to go to Seoul?

36:06.205 --> 36:08.249
I come home a few times a month.

36:09.500 --> 36:10.710
That was not what I meant.

36:13.087 --> 36:15.756
Do you want to do something new in Seoul?

36:19.719 --> 36:22.180
Something you haven't done before.
Something a little dangerous.

36:25.558 --> 36:27.059
So that's why you're here.

36:27.560 --> 36:28.728
You will never come here.

36:32.857 --> 36:34.609
You must infiltrate their group,

36:34.692 --> 36:38.404
and if you see, hear about,
and participate in amphetamine trafficking,

36:38.487 --> 36:40.698
then we can also catch the Japanese.

36:41.574 --> 36:44.619
So I have to be a dirty guy
to catch the dirty guys.

36:44.702 --> 36:45.661
Preach

36:46.871 --> 36:50.166
Have you ever
researched this way before?

36:56.172 --> 36:57.757
Come now.

36:57.840 --> 37:00.218
If you want to catch thugs,

37:00.301 --> 37:03.054
then you track them.
You don't become one of them.

37:05.139 --> 37:07.934
Come on, we're cops.
It is degrading.

37:08.684 --> 37:11.520
And when my wife's family hears about it,

37:11.604 --> 37:13.689
they will say I do crazy things

37:14.649 --> 37:17.026
instead of studying
for the promotion exam.

37:18.653 --> 37:22.448
Amphetamine in the billions, enough to
make 330,000 people affected,

37:22.531 --> 37:24.450
must spread across the country.

37:24.867 --> 37:26.077
Think of your father.

37:33.334 --> 37:36.254
When you hate something so much,
you can't even look at it.

37:40.091 --> 37:42.218
Forget it. I will not do it.

37:42.468 --> 37:45.930
There are many other officers
who can do that.

37:56.565 --> 37:57.775
How can I help?

37:57.900 --> 38:00.278
Is Officer Park Junmo here?

38:00.361 --> 38:01.862
Junmo.

38:05.992 --> 38:07.368
He's over there.

38:07.868 --> 38:08.703
What is it?

38:11.205 --> 38:16.085
I heard you and NCID's
Captain Seok Dohyung are like brothers.

38:16.168 --> 38:19.839
A difficult high school student from Daejeon
who was known for fighting.

38:20.464 --> 38:24.135
And a friendly police officer
who steered him in the right direction.

38:24.218 --> 38:25.636
I asked Captain Seok

38:25.720 --> 38:29.682
to recommend someone
suitable for this investigation,

38:30.224 --> 38:31.851
and he said your name right away.

38:31.934 --> 38:34.437
But I have said no.

38:36.105 --> 38:38.149
All the police chiefs

38:38.232 --> 38:41.402
obviously knows about
the incidents at your wedding.

38:42.945 --> 38:46.949
Even I wouldn't give a promotion

38:47.033 --> 38:48.826
to the son of a drug addict.

39:02.965 --> 39:04.800
If this case ends well,

39:04.884 --> 39:07.470
you get a significant bonus
and a special promotion.

39:08.804 --> 39:10.931
You can't stay
in the low ranks forever.

39:14.185 --> 39:15.895
Attendant Park,

39:15.978 --> 39:19.523
chances like this don't come around every day.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.610
You can rise through the ranks

39:23.486 --> 39:25.404
with the help of the prosecution.

39:27.990 --> 39:29.950
Your wife has been selected for Seoul

39:30.034 --> 39:32.161
with his promotion to police assistant.

39:32.828 --> 39:33.829
Isn't that wonderful?

39:52.556 --> 39:54.058
SOUTHERN SEOUL PLAZA

41:01.125 --> 41:02.126
Come now.

41:26.275 --> 41:27.693
I do so on one condition.

41:27.776 --> 41:28.694
A condition?

41:28.986 --> 41:30.154
Forget the bonus.

41:33.115 --> 41:35.409
But I want to move up two rows.

41:39.079 --> 41:40.664
- Two rows?
- Yes.

41:42.416 --> 41:46.253
I'm the only one
who puts life on the line.

41:47.546 --> 41:49.423
I think I deserve it.

41:52.426 --> 41:54.595
If it ends well,

41:54.678 --> 41:56.680
Aren't you also rising in the ranks?

41:57.765 --> 41:58.891
Why...

42:00.851 --> 42:05.397
...don't you ascend
with the help of a subordinate officer?

42:13.447 --> 42:14.823
Is there any precedent?

42:14.907 --> 42:16.784
In 1989 to capture Im Jongseok.

42:16.867 --> 42:19.995
The head of the Students' National Council.

42:28.295 --> 42:29.296
Okay.

42:41.058 --> 42:43.477
Recently, amphetamine
with over 95% purity

42:43.561 --> 42:47.106
been widespread in Gangnam as in Japan.

42:47.189 --> 42:48.899
Specifically, Gangnam Crystal.

42:48.983 --> 42:51.694
We thought
it was connected to gangsters in Gangnam,

42:51.777 --> 42:53.862
so we did a little digging.

42:53.946 --> 42:54.989
Before was Jang Kyungchul,

42:55.072 --> 42:57.950
also known as "Sergeant Jang",
commander of the area.

42:58.033 --> 42:59.702
But Jung Gicheul overthrew him,

42:59.785 --> 43:02.329
which Busan's Song Donghyuk disregarded.

43:02.413 --> 43:05.165
Jung Gicheul is now the leader of Gangnam Union,

43:05.249 --> 43:08.627
and the main members of the new
gang are students from Yeoksam High School.

43:09.128 --> 43:11.797
They have been like brothers
since they were very young,

43:11.880 --> 43:13.632
so they have a bond like a family.

43:13.716 --> 43:16.802
Therefore, we did not rely on our
usual investigative methods,

43:16.927 --> 43:19.388
and so we planned this.

43:20.514 --> 43:22.308
When Jung wanted to get rid of Jang,

43:22.391 --> 43:24.310
a member was stabbed to death.

43:24.602 --> 43:25.853
His name was Kwon Taeho.

43:25.936 --> 43:28.564
He was Jung Gicheul's
best friend from high school.

43:29.398 --> 43:32.693
The members of Gangnam Union said
that Sergeant Jang was the killer,

43:32.776 --> 43:35.946
but since he disappeared,
the case has never been solved.

43:37.156 --> 43:38.157
Gangnam Union...

43:38.699 --> 43:41.243
Is there anything else special about them?

43:41.327 --> 43:43.996
Gangnam Union took power
in Gangnam really fast.

43:46.457 --> 43:47.458
From the outside

43:47.541 --> 43:50.919
it almost looks like a social club
for young entrepreneurs.

43:52.254 --> 43:55.883
But over
the past six months in Gangnam

43:55.966 --> 43:58.385
they have almost taken over all the nightclubs.

43:59.345 --> 44:00.971
Where did they get all that money from?

44:01.055 --> 44:02.514
KARAOKE, LUCKY DISCO

44:02.598 --> 44:05.267
It probably has
something to do with Gangnam Crystal.

44:06.727 --> 44:09.647
Junmo, you will now be
Kwon Taeho's fake cousin

44:09.730 --> 44:11.857
of the same age named Kwon Seungho,

44:11.940 --> 44:13.734
and you need to be close to Gangnam Union.

44:13.817 --> 44:16.695
This is the backstory
we made up for Kwon Seungho.

44:16.779 --> 44:18.739
He works as a fisherman.

44:19.156 --> 44:20.115
Kwon Seungho.

44:20.199 --> 44:23.077
I'll take care of
his backstory beforehand.

44:23.160 --> 44:24.161
Do not think about it.

44:24.244 --> 44:26.246
Do you know Sikgaek in Yeoksam-dong?

44:26.914 --> 44:29.583
They recently took over that business.

44:30.042 --> 44:33.003
Some of the members
eat dinner there several times a week,

44:33.087 --> 44:34.963
and we suppose they are high-ranking.

44:35.881 --> 44:38.342
Safety is key
to the success of this operation.

44:38.425 --> 44:41.553
There may be cops
who are close to the gangsters,

44:41.637 --> 44:43.722
so let's be discreet from the start.

44:43.806 --> 44:44.723
Hello.

44:46.058 --> 44:48.644
Do you take sick leave when you look so healthy?

44:50.396 --> 44:51.271
Junmo.

44:52.022 --> 44:52.981
Are you okay?

44:53.065 --> 44:53.982
Hello.

44:55.526 --> 44:57.361
- Take care of yourself, okay?
- Okay.

44:57.444 --> 44:58.904
Get well.

44:58.987 --> 45:00.030
Asthma?

45:01.865 --> 45:04.201
Gangnam Unions chef, Jung Gicheul.

45:06.662 --> 45:08.539
According to his travel records,

45:08.622 --> 45:10.290
within the last six months,

45:10.374 --> 45:12.543
he has visited Japan and China twice.

45:15.587 --> 45:16.588
Depth?

45:17.131 --> 45:19.800
If they manufacture Gangnam Crystal themselves,

45:19.883 --> 45:23.971
then maybe they buy the
ingredient ephedrine in China.

45:25.848 --> 45:27.850
Gangnam Union and Jung Gicheul.

45:29.435 --> 45:32.396
The worst drug crime
in Korean history.

45:36.108 --> 45:37.234
Now let's think about,

45:38.193 --> 45:40.237
how Kwon Seongho should

45:40.320 --> 45:42.656
go to Jung Gicheul first time.

45:44.283 --> 45:45.826
Let me try my way.

45:49.538 --> 45:51.498
GANGNAM UNION
JUNG GICHEUL

46:16.648 --> 46:19.026
SIKGAEK

46:32.498 --> 46:35.000
You must order something, Mr.

46:35.375 --> 46:37.044
I'm not here to eat.

46:38.712 --> 46:40.380
I want to talk to the owner.

46:40.464 --> 46:42.591
I am the owner.
I don't know what you mean.

46:44.009 --> 46:46.804
I know
Gangnam Union took over this place.

46:46.887 --> 46:48.597
Isn't Jung Gicheul the owner?

46:49.097 --> 46:50.474
Get me Jung Gicheul.

46:51.975 --> 46:52.976
Hurry up.

46:53.560 --> 46:54.561
He's over there.

46:59.066 --> 47:00.067
Who are you?

47:00.567 --> 47:03.237
We have customers, so get up and go.

47:05.155 --> 47:08.242
If I get up,
you'll end up on the floor, you rats.

47:09.284 --> 47:11.703
Now just get me Jung Gicheul.

47:12.538 --> 47:13.664
What?

47:14.998 --> 47:17.167
Damn it. Fine.

47:19.169 --> 47:20.254
You fucking...

47:24.883 --> 47:25.717
Before hell.

47:28.053 --> 47:31.682
Boss, shouldn't we eat
somewhere other than Sikgaek today?

47:31.765 --> 47:33.058
Why?

47:33.433 --> 47:35.477
Download Jung Gicheul.

47:35.811 --> 47:37.396
Get the owner.

47:38.313 --> 47:39.648
Can you hear me?

47:39.731 --> 47:41.483
Then get Jung Gicheul.

47:41.692 --> 47:44.278
There is obviously a madman
in the making.

47:44.361 --> 47:47.030
I'll take care of it after dinner.

47:48.282 --> 47:49.241
Who is he?

47:49.324 --> 47:53.370
SIKGAEK

47:57.833 --> 47:59.501
No, stop!

47:59.585 --> 48:00.878
Don't throw it away.

48:02.588 --> 48:04.256
He wants to talk to Gicheul.

48:05.757 --> 48:06.884
Me?

48:06.967 --> 48:08.010
Yes, boss.

48:08.468 --> 48:09.553
Why?

48:09.636 --> 48:11.597
Those kinds of guys never say why.

48:11.680 --> 48:12.764
Just forget it.

48:14.224 --> 48:15.809
Who the hell is that?

48:19.730 --> 48:20.981
Fucking idiots.

48:21.607 --> 48:22.858
Get the boss.

48:29.031 --> 48:30.115
Let's examine it.

48:31.199 --> 48:33.535
Crazy people need a lesson.

48:36.330 --> 48:38.040
Get Jung Gicheul!

48:44.212 --> 48:45.505
Come on.

49:18.914 --> 49:20.540
I heard you were looking for me.

49:25.170 --> 49:28.131
Why are you so hard to meet?

49:33.971 --> 49:34.846
Hello.

49:37.432 --> 49:38.850
Are you Jung Gicheul?

49:50.529 --> 49:52.447
Let me go, you asshole.

50:04.501 --> 50:05.669
Who are you?

53:50.060 --> 53:52.062
