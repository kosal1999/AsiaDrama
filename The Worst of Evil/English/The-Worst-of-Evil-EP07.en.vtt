00:01.710 --> 00:08.717
CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

00:12.554 --> 00:14.764
I confirmed that he entered the police station.

00:15.015 --> 00:18.018
If he obstructed justice
and assaulted a police officer,

00:18.226 --> 00:19.310
it won't be simple.

00:20.437 --> 00:22.063
Seek more information.

00:22.147 --> 00:23.148
Yes, boss.

00:23.231 --> 00:26.067
And discover the suspicions
that motivated Hwang Mingoo.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.152
Yes sir.

00:39.497 --> 00:40.707
No...

00:40.832 --> 00:44.502
Apparently, you were once an athlete.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.046
But today he is a marginal.

00:46.129 --> 00:48.256
If you cross the line with the police,

00:48.339 --> 00:50.216
you could end up dead.

00:53.219 --> 00:54.304
You laughed?

00:55.263 --> 00:59.559
Are the South Korean police
a joke to you?

00:59.976 --> 01:01.102
I already know.

01:01.186 --> 01:03.813
I'll take off the badge.
How about solving it by beating it up?

01:03.897 --> 01:06.733
-Calm down, sir.
-Come up, son of a bitch!

01:06.816 --> 01:08.068
Come on, bastard!

01:08.151 --> 01:10.028
-Let me go.
-Calm down, sir.

01:10.111 --> 01:11.905
Get rid of that arrogance.

01:11.988 --> 01:13.740
Or do you want to go straight to jail?

01:13.823 --> 01:15.075
As you can see,

01:15.575 --> 01:17.577
I came to surrender.

01:19.746 --> 01:20.997
Skirt. And even?

01:21.581 --> 01:23.333
If you came to surrender,

01:23.416 --> 01:27.128
lift your head
and list all your crimes.

01:28.880 --> 01:33.635
I lost control and crossed the line

01:33.718 --> 01:35.762
when attacking a public servant.

01:35.845 --> 01:36.846
Sorry.

01:38.473 --> 01:41.851
I told you to list the crimes,
not apologize, damn it.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.315
I accept any punishment.

01:47.440 --> 01:48.775
Enough chit-chat.

01:49.818 --> 01:53.404
Who were those people
in the hotel room?

01:53.488 --> 01:55.532
Listen here.

01:55.657 --> 02:00.036
I'm not interested in fucking
a nobody like you, okay?

02:00.787 --> 02:03.748
Who were those sons of bitches?

02:03.832 --> 02:06.793
Those who left the hotel room
with Jung Gicheul.

02:06.876 --> 02:07.919
Who is this?

02:08.002 --> 02:09.254
Who are these fuckers?

02:09.337 --> 02:10.880
-I don't know.
-Then...

02:11.422 --> 02:14.175
Don't try to take the blame.
Just tell me the truth.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.844
Who are they?

02:15.927 --> 02:18.847
I'm a fucking nobody,
so I don't know anything.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.223
I just know...

02:20.306 --> 02:22.934
that they invest in my boss.

02:23.017 --> 02:24.185
Just that.

02:24.269 --> 02:27.355
As if! Who invests in a criminal?

02:27.438 --> 02:30.066
And why did investors run away?

02:30.859 --> 02:32.152
Just look...

02:33.903 --> 02:35.655
It would be strange not to run away

02:35.738 --> 02:38.199
of a police officer who arrives screaming
like a crazy person.

02:38.283 --> 02:40.243
What the fuck did you say?

02:40.326 --> 02:41.953
Repeat what you said.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.207
It seems that you were also an athlete.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.711
Truth be told. Who was once an athlete,

02:49.794 --> 02:52.172
You just become a criminal or a police officer, right?

02:52.255 --> 02:53.256
AND?

02:54.799 --> 02:57.343
We are practically the same.

02:57.427 --> 03:00.054
Just had a little more luck

03:00.138 --> 03:02.807
for holding this position today.

03:03.683 --> 03:06.895
Police officer, just look at one thing.

03:06.978 --> 03:09.355
He's acting like a criminal.

03:09.439 --> 03:10.773
Damn!

03:10.857 --> 03:12.942
Don't you feel ashamed, you worm?

03:13.026 --> 03:14.903
Seriously, sir. Let me go!

03:14.986 --> 03:16.446
It's done, bastard!

03:16.529 --> 03:19.115
Son of a bitch!

03:19.199 --> 03:21.242
Come here, son of a bitch!

03:21.326 --> 03:24.954
-Sir.
-Fucking hell!

03:25.038 --> 03:26.372
-Sir.
-Take it here!

03:27.248 --> 03:28.416
Son of a bitch!

03:28.499 --> 03:29.626
Stop, sir.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.002
-Stop.
-Let me go!

03:31.085 --> 03:33.254
Stupid son of a bitch!

03:33.755 --> 03:35.006
Damned hell!

03:35.089 --> 03:37.342
Let go of me, idiot!

03:37.425 --> 03:39.219
Take it here.

03:39.302 --> 03:43.598
You think you can escape
my punches, you fucker?

03:43.681 --> 03:46.684
Fucking scoundrel!

03:49.020 --> 03:52.649
Do you think you'll escape
my punches, scoundrel?

03:52.732 --> 03:54.317
How dare you?

03:54.400 --> 03:58.029
Fucking scoundrel!

03:58.112 --> 04:01.282
-How dare you?
-I already asked you to stop!

04:07.121 --> 04:09.707
Let go of me, idiot!

04:25.932 --> 04:32.522
THE WORST OF EVIL

04:40.613 --> 04:44.033
Very good. Let's continue.

04:44.951 --> 04:45.952
Then...

04:47.996 --> 04:49.247
Who were those?

04:49.330 --> 04:51.332
Fuck, I don't know.

04:52.542 --> 04:57.088
Holy shit, you piece of shit!

04:57.880 --> 05:00.675
Do you still think I'm joking?

05:00.758 --> 05:04.345
What? Are you going to hit me again?

05:05.847 --> 05:07.765
You can hit.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.350
Kill me already, asshole.

05:09.434 --> 05:12.729
It can leave. Die, motherfucker.

05:12.812 --> 05:14.314
What's going on here?

05:34.792 --> 05:38.963
Is this kind of thing common
in the Gangnam Police Station?

05:39.047 --> 05:40.465
No sir.

05:40.548 --> 05:42.759
No way.

05:42.842 --> 05:44.427
Sir,

05:44.510 --> 05:47.847
May I ask the reason
for your surprise visit?

05:47.930 --> 05:51.726
I came to bring information
about a homicide case.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.689
I heard they were
in the middle of an investigation.

06:00.943 --> 06:03.696
Yes sir.
Involves a missing drug dealer

06:03.780 --> 06:05.323
known as Manager Cho.

06:06.449 --> 06:08.242
Maybe it's the same case.

06:10.036 --> 06:13.206
But I can't help a police officer
who commits violence.

06:14.957 --> 06:18.086
I need to report the assault
that just happened, right?

06:18.795 --> 06:20.880
Please sir.

06:20.963 --> 06:22.757
We are sorry for what happened.

06:27.845 --> 06:31.516
I will take strict measures
to discipline my officers.

06:31.891 --> 06:34.060
I ask you to let it go just this once.

06:36.020 --> 06:36.938
He heard?

06:37.522 --> 06:39.232
I'll be more careful.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.217
Take it.

07:11.013 --> 07:13.516
What the hell...

07:13.599 --> 07:14.684
What it was?

07:15.017 --> 07:18.688
They asked me to sign something
saying I won't sue them.

07:18.771 --> 07:21.149
They said they would release me if I forgot

07:21.232 --> 07:22.442
the aggression.

07:26.070 --> 07:27.613
Listen...

07:27.697 --> 07:28.698
Say.

07:29.031 --> 07:30.616
You know everything, right?

07:32.869 --> 07:33.786
What?

07:33.870 --> 07:35.496
You saw everything at the hotel.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.498
What does the boss do?

07:38.040 --> 07:39.459
What's the deal with China?

07:40.084 --> 07:43.337
Why the fuck did he take you
instead of me?

07:49.051 --> 07:50.970
It's related to drugs.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.848
My father is an addict, you know.

07:55.016 --> 07:57.351
So it's an area that I dominate.

07:58.102 --> 07:59.770
I suspected this shit.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.900
Only the three heads are involved.

08:04.275 --> 08:06.027
Let's join them, Boss Seo.

08:06.944 --> 08:08.196
You wanted to get rich.

08:08.279 --> 08:11.115
I'll only earn big
if they let me participate.

08:11.199 --> 08:13.534
We need to participate no matter what.

08:14.702 --> 08:15.995
If you don't have space,

08:16.746 --> 08:17.955
we take someone out.

08:21.626 --> 08:22.835
Are you serious?

08:22.919 --> 08:25.463
You deserve to be part of this.

08:27.089 --> 08:29.133
Nobody cares more than you.

08:29.967 --> 08:31.969
Seriously, it's a complete injustice.

08:32.762 --> 08:35.389
You deserve to get rich.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.360
Tome.

08:49.445 --> 08:50.446
Good job.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.365
Thanks.

08:57.578 --> 08:59.914
He was very lucky, really.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.583
He was being beaten by Hwang Mingoo,

09:02.667 --> 09:05.836
and the chief prosecutor showed up just in time.

09:05.920 --> 09:09.173
Does your police friend

09:09.298 --> 09:12.385
Did you touch him?

09:12.760 --> 09:15.346
Were you upset
because Seungho was released?

09:15.805 --> 09:19.725
There were plainclothes police officers
inside that hotel.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.894
What are you talking about?

09:21.978 --> 09:23.312
Did you happen to see it?

09:23.396 --> 09:26.274
It was just my intuition.

09:26.357 --> 09:28.276
Did you have that intuition?

09:30.820 --> 09:33.698
Your intuition always gets it right.

09:33.781 --> 09:36.117
Why didn't you unmask the police officer?

09:36.242 --> 09:39.579
I can't come up and ask,
"Are you a police officer?"

09:40.288 --> 09:41.497
You're right.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.332
You can notice their presence.

09:45.334 --> 09:48.462
Wherever you go,
there are always some public servants.

09:48.546 --> 09:51.632
Plainclothes police, prosecutor

09:51.716 --> 09:53.467
and that friend of yours.

09:53.551 --> 09:55.553
The police officer from the Security Division.

09:56.762 --> 09:57.930
Jungbae.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.015
Yes sir.

09:59.098 --> 10:00.725
What are your suspicions?

10:01.684 --> 10:02.852
Well, then...

10:03.436 --> 10:05.980
No one gets away
with attacking a police officer.

10:06.063 --> 10:08.524
So the cops
are protecting Seungho?

10:09.650 --> 10:12.028
This is certainly not the case,

10:12.111 --> 10:14.030
but there is something strange.

10:15.114 --> 10:17.408
Seungho went there in your place.

10:20.953 --> 10:23.331
Leave it there. Let's enjoy the drink.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.087
-Jungbae.
-May I help?

10:30.963 --> 10:33.841
There are several inconsistencies
in this month's accounting.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.676
Need to tidy up.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.638
Sure, boss. It can leave.

11:01.619 --> 11:04.038
Jungbae takes care
of the company's accounting.

11:04.747 --> 11:06.957
He is very meticulous.
I hope he understands.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.091
Boss,

11:15.174 --> 11:17.677
What did you decide with the Chinese?

11:18.719 --> 11:20.179
We are still at an impasse.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.558
What if you talked to them?

11:25.685 --> 11:26.686
Forgiveness?

11:26.769 --> 11:28.688
The Chinese woman was interested in you.

11:29.730 --> 11:31.357
Why don't you go out and talk?

11:31.440 --> 11:33.025
Like this?

11:33.776 --> 11:36.362
Seungho is smart and solves things,

11:36.445 --> 11:38.406
but he is still a newbie.

11:40.157 --> 11:43.577
Especially for something of this relevance.

11:44.161 --> 11:47.331
I think this role is yours.

11:48.332 --> 11:51.085
The conversation only flows as equals.

11:51.585 --> 11:55.214
These ingrates from China and Japan forget

11:57.049 --> 11:59.343
who only became rich because of me.

12:00.678 --> 12:02.471
They despised me and insulted me.

12:04.014 --> 12:05.850
They're sons of bitches.

12:05.933 --> 12:09.270
I'll handle it, boss.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.440
I can fix these scoundrels

12:13.232 --> 12:15.234
who insulted you.

12:17.695 --> 12:19.447
Let's talk about this later,

12:19.530 --> 12:21.949
when Jungbae is here.

12:22.032 --> 12:24.368
Okay, let's drink.

12:24.452 --> 12:27.079
Kwon Seungho did very well.

12:36.797 --> 12:40.009
And whether you're with a drug dealer or not.

12:42.511 --> 12:44.096
There's no way to help.

12:44.513 --> 12:48.684
His Japanese godfather
thinks he is the king himself.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.105
Will you disobey?

12:54.398 --> 12:57.067
So our agreement came to an end.

13:07.036 --> 13:08.037
Hello?

13:11.081 --> 13:12.249
Oi, Euijeong.

13:13.125 --> 13:17.087
LEE AND BODYGUARDS

13:17.630 --> 13:20.841
I informed the Chinese police
about the fake passports.

13:20.925 --> 13:23.093
They will start an investigation too.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.473
We are almost there.

13:28.265 --> 13:30.810
We discovered the intentions
of the Chinese and the Japanese.

13:31.143 --> 13:32.978
We already know what they plan.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.482
Why don't we arrest them soon?

13:36.565 --> 13:38.025
We can not do that.

13:39.109 --> 13:43.072
And if this Miss. Lee
close the drug factory?

13:43.656 --> 13:47.660
What if the Japanese insist
that they only bought fake glasses and watches?

13:48.744 --> 13:53.123
In that case, our only option
would be to accuse Jung Gicheul of murder.

13:54.041 --> 13:56.961
We just need one more thing.

13:59.588 --> 14:02.675
Catch them red-handed
at the time of negotiation.

14:02.758 --> 14:05.344
The problem is that their agreement
is hanging by a thread.

14:06.428 --> 14:09.765
We can't let it break.
We need them to negotiate again.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.308
Drug...

14:11.392 --> 14:15.855
All good. I'll talk to the Chinese woman.

14:17.398 --> 14:21.318
I want them to fix Choi Jungbae.

14:21.402 --> 14:23.195
He's the one who suspects me the most.

14:23.612 --> 14:25.739
I have no idea how he will react.

14:27.449 --> 14:30.369
Let's get him away from Jung Gicheul
as quickly as possible.

14:35.165 --> 14:37.084
I noticed you're worried.

14:41.547 --> 14:42.506
Can you notice?

14:42.590 --> 14:45.426
In difficult times,
you were always quiet.

14:48.470 --> 14:50.598
Whatever it is,

14:50.681 --> 14:52.516
I know it will turn around.

14:53.392 --> 14:55.269
As he always did.

14:55.352 --> 14:58.689
In the old days,
we would meet at night

14:59.732 --> 15:03.068
and talked about everything. Remember?

15:05.321 --> 15:07.615
I remember. And truth.

15:13.203 --> 15:14.914
I know by chance...

15:17.041 --> 15:19.919
need help, let me know.

15:21.086 --> 15:22.463
Why?

15:22.546 --> 15:23.547
As?

15:24.089 --> 15:25.549
Do you want to help me?

15:29.094 --> 15:30.095
You helped...

15:30.846 --> 15:32.097
Seungho too?

15:33.807 --> 15:35.184
Like this?

15:38.103 --> 15:38.979
Anything.

15:42.232 --> 15:44.902
Talking to you makes me feel good.

16:00.334 --> 16:01.752
Euijeong.

16:04.755 --> 16:05.965
How do you cope

16:06.966 --> 16:08.509
Missing your mother?

16:09.051 --> 16:10.177
I don't read.

16:11.095 --> 16:14.390
I let the sadness take over.

16:17.893 --> 16:20.396
It was nice talking to you.
Be careful on the way back.

16:21.522 --> 16:22.815
Goodnight.

16:39.915 --> 16:41.083
Hey.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.719
-Have you eaten yet?
-Good...

16:51.802 --> 16:53.178
Not yet.

16:53.804 --> 16:54.847
For you ma'am.

16:55.681 --> 16:58.308
Our!

17:08.819 --> 17:09.945
Thanks for the food.

17:15.242 --> 17:16.243
Very good.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.043
Why don't you go to church anymore?

17:28.547 --> 17:29.673
Ashamed of me?

17:30.716 --> 17:33.427
Don't say that.

17:33.510 --> 17:35.637
What kind of mother is ashamed of her son?

17:42.811 --> 17:44.354
Can you do me a favor?

17:59.203 --> 18:01.038
TAKE AWAY

18:50.295 --> 18:51.797
How can I help you?

20:24.223 --> 20:25.891
Hello?

20:25.974 --> 20:27.601
Hey.

20:27.684 --> 20:28.727
Say.

20:28.810 --> 20:30.896
It's Kwon Seungho.

20:30.979 --> 20:33.607
We saw each other that day at the hotel.

20:33.690 --> 20:36.360
Clear! So you managed to get away with it?

21:08.558 --> 21:09.893
What are you doing?

21:12.396 --> 21:14.982
Do you think I hid a damn bomb?

21:18.151 --> 21:21.071
I remembered. He doesn't speak Korean.

21:32.958 --> 21:35.627
Damn, so that's how
you got away with it?

21:37.838 --> 21:39.589
Was a beating enough to solve it?

21:47.014 --> 21:48.015
No.

21:54.813 --> 21:58.525
Take good care of her, you hear?

22:03.697 --> 22:07.951
So this bastard speaks Korean.

22:11.955 --> 22:13.457
Are you coming from the hotel?

22:14.791 --> 22:17.336
Maybe yes maybe no.

22:17.419 --> 22:18.337
I understood.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.214
Where do you want to go?

22:21.548 --> 22:24.676
Somewhere with lots of land and houses.

22:33.935 --> 22:34.936
Who is it?

22:35.020 --> 22:37.147
I came to request your services.

22:37.522 --> 22:38.648
We are closed.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.484
You know me.

22:40.567 --> 22:42.194
I work with Jung Gicheul.

22:50.660 --> 22:52.037
What do you want?

22:52.704 --> 22:55.707
I didn't come to ask for anything complicated.

22:55.791 --> 22:59.669
You know that woman
my boss asked for information from?

22:59.753 --> 23:01.963
I just wanted to know

23:02.756 --> 23:04.091
a little more about her.

23:05.425 --> 23:06.426
In what sense?

23:06.510 --> 23:10.138
A newbie named Kwon Seungho arrived.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.849
He says he went to
the same school as Yu Euijeong.

23:12.933 --> 23:14.976
I want to know if it's true.

23:15.060 --> 23:17.562
I also need to know
if she really lived in Wonju.

23:18.522 --> 23:21.525
If she lived there,
was she Kwon Seungho's neighbor?

23:28.490 --> 23:31.284
I noticed you didn't like my order.

23:36.164 --> 23:39.000
If you confirm the information,
I will pay triple.

24:24.546 --> 24:25.839
Hello? It's Cheon speaking.

24:26.923 --> 24:28.592
One of your guys came here.

24:28.675 --> 24:29.676
Choi Jungbae?

24:29.759 --> 24:31.428
Yes, that's him.

24:32.012 --> 24:33.513
Did you mention the other accounting book?

24:34.514 --> 24:37.058
I only do what you say.

24:37.684 --> 24:39.019
I did not say anything.

25:09.591 --> 25:11.384
Your job is to be a tour guide.

25:11.468 --> 25:13.762
Aren't you going to explain things to me?

25:15.096 --> 25:17.432
Well, then...

25:22.354 --> 25:23.605
That is...

25:24.314 --> 25:26.483
a roofed house from the Joseon Dynasty.

25:27.150 --> 25:28.235
I understood.

25:34.616 --> 25:35.575
And those fish...

25:36.785 --> 25:38.370
Are carps from the Joseon Dynasty?

25:39.788 --> 25:42.666
It's a lake from the Joseon Dynasty, so...

25:51.550 --> 25:54.719
Didn't you say you wanted
to look at real estate?

25:54.803 --> 25:57.430
Houses with old roofs
are also real estate.

26:02.310 --> 26:04.437
Didn't stop here just to find out

26:04.521 --> 26:05.981
if someone followed us?

26:13.697 --> 26:16.157
I thought you only had muscles,

26:17.450 --> 26:18.743
but it has a brain too.

26:19.536 --> 26:21.204
Have you finished the inspection?

26:27.460 --> 26:29.296
How about we eat something nice?

26:31.631 --> 26:33.341
Something very tasty and typical.

27:27.062 --> 27:30.649
Seungho, you don't look like a gangster.

27:30.732 --> 27:32.192
Looks more like a soldier.

27:34.527 --> 27:37.113
Don't see me as a gangster.

27:37.906 --> 27:39.532
see me

27:39.616 --> 27:43.078
as an aspiring entrepreneur.

27:45.497 --> 27:46.498
May I ask...

27:48.166 --> 27:50.335
What part of China are you from?

27:53.380 --> 27:54.381
Guess.

27:56.383 --> 27:57.384
Shanghai?

27:59.094 --> 28:00.095
Beijing?

28:02.222 --> 28:03.640
Then...

28:05.892 --> 28:07.477
When we see each other again,

28:07.560 --> 28:10.146
I will be sharp in China's geography.

28:15.318 --> 28:17.779
Why are you so loyal to Mr. Jung

28:18.780 --> 28:20.281
to the point of risking your life?

28:27.914 --> 28:28.915
Clear.

28:30.834 --> 28:31.835
I don't know.

28:32.877 --> 28:33.878
Simply...

28:36.464 --> 28:37.549
it comes from within.

28:39.551 --> 28:40.760
Inside?

28:41.511 --> 28:43.513
-Yes.
-I thought...

28:43.596 --> 28:45.849
that was in exchange for some property or asset.

28:46.641 --> 28:47.767
No.

28:50.353 --> 28:52.897
I really admire him

28:52.981 --> 28:54.107
and I like him.

28:54.899 --> 28:57.527
And my body follows my heart.

28:58.778 --> 29:00.488
What a romantic guy!

29:01.448 --> 29:03.158
This is bad?

29:04.117 --> 29:09.164
No, on the contrary. I just found it curious.

29:10.623 --> 29:12.000
It's unusual.

29:19.007 --> 29:20.175
Then,

29:20.258 --> 29:22.927
I still don't know your name.

29:28.183 --> 29:29.350
Lee Haeryun.

29:31.644 --> 29:34.522
What form of treatment should I use?

29:34.606 --> 29:36.983
You can call me whatever you want.

29:47.577 --> 29:49.120
Haeryun,

29:49.204 --> 29:51.331
Will you continue to negotiate with Mr. Jung?

29:52.373 --> 29:54.959
The accident that happened
will never happen again.

29:55.460 --> 29:58.463
I will be by Mr. Jung's side
to ensure it doesn't happen again.

30:01.716 --> 30:03.218
Can bring.

30:17.232 --> 30:20.109
We have some Korean informants
who work nights.

30:20.193 --> 30:22.487
They told us
where to buy meth.

30:51.391 --> 30:52.725
If it sinks, it's bad.

30:53.893 --> 30:55.895
If it bubbles, it is of high quality.

30:55.979 --> 30:58.523
The quality of this one is excellent.

30:58.606 --> 31:01.025
Only we offer this quality.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.736
And what does that mean?

31:03.820 --> 31:04.863
Here is a typical dish.

31:05.738 --> 31:06.948
Try it.

31:28.511 --> 31:31.306
Mr. Jung embezzled our products,

31:31.389 --> 31:34.058
that should arrive in Japan,

31:34.142 --> 31:36.686
to sell them here in South Korea.

31:38.021 --> 31:41.983
How to negotiate with someone
who doesn't inspire trust?

31:44.027 --> 31:45.528
My apologies.

31:45.612 --> 31:47.989
I don't know how my boss works.

31:48.072 --> 31:48.907
And that?

31:50.617 --> 31:52.452
Don't you have anything else to say?

31:54.871 --> 31:58.207
No suggestions?

32:14.390 --> 32:16.517
Wait, I have a proposal.

32:16.601 --> 32:18.227
If you don't trust my boss...

32:20.355 --> 32:21.648
you can trust me.

32:22.649 --> 32:23.733
I'll take it to Japan,

32:24.692 --> 32:25.818
in my boss's place.

32:28.488 --> 32:29.864
Give me a chance.

32:30.740 --> 32:33.576
So you're going to betray Mr. Jung?

32:33.660 --> 32:35.536
I will not betray you.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.705
I will ask his permission

32:38.247 --> 32:41.167
to officially participate in the operation.

32:41.459 --> 32:43.211
If I help you make a profit,

32:43.294 --> 32:45.129
there is no reason for him to object.

32:48.383 --> 32:49.509
However,

32:50.802 --> 32:53.137
what difference does it make to me

32:54.472 --> 32:56.140
for you to be the intermediary?

33:02.981 --> 33:04.107
The difference is that...

33:07.527 --> 33:09.237
if we work together,

33:12.907 --> 33:15.076
will spend more time with me.

33:17.662 --> 33:19.038
Seung Ho.

33:21.624 --> 33:23.084
When it comes to work,

33:24.252 --> 33:26.087
What do you think is worth more?

33:27.171 --> 33:28.840
The heart or the money?

33:42.145 --> 33:44.981
Gicheul diverts products
that go to Japan.

33:45.064 --> 33:47.275
The Chinese discovered
that it sells here.

33:47.734 --> 33:51.904
Cum! The agreement with the Chinese company
could end up going down the drain.

33:54.365 --> 33:55.366
We need to act.

33:56.284 --> 33:58.870
Let's stop these drugs
from being sold here.

33:58.953 --> 34:00.538
When we resolve this,

34:00.955 --> 34:04.042
I will find a way to convince the Chinese.

34:06.210 --> 34:09.380
They said they sell the drug
at Tae-ho Rock Cafe.

34:12.759 --> 34:15.094
Let's set up bait for Choi Jungbae

34:15.178 --> 34:16.512
and deliver us from it.

34:19.682 --> 34:21.809
Let's go!

34:21.893 --> 34:23.394
Hey, how are you?

34:23.478 --> 34:26.522
Okay, let's do it.

34:29.859 --> 34:34.238
Shouldn't they dress better here?
What outfit is that?

34:35.281 --> 34:36.282
Good evening, sir.

34:36.365 --> 34:38.868
OK let's go.

34:38.951 --> 34:39.994
Let's go.

34:46.042 --> 34:47.668
NARCOTICS DIVISION

34:52.507 --> 34:55.927
As for Tae-ho Rock Cafe...

34:56.010 --> 34:57.678
I'm fucking talking to you.

34:57.804 --> 34:58.930
Right.

34:59.972 --> 35:02.266
Rumor has it that there's a new drug there.

35:02.350 --> 35:04.727
-I understood.
-"Gangnam Crystal."

35:04.811 --> 35:06.437
-And you are the owner of the nightclub.
-I am.

35:06.521 --> 35:07.897
Then you must know something.

35:11.150 --> 35:12.318
Can I have a cigarette?

35:32.713 --> 35:33.714
Do not know?

35:35.424 --> 35:37.093
Cum...

35:37.176 --> 35:38.678
What is this?

35:40.179 --> 35:41.180
Are many.

35:41.264 --> 35:43.766
You are a very curious guy.

35:43.850 --> 35:45.893
-It is written in Chinese.
-Chinese?

35:45.977 --> 35:48.062
Bring a Chinese dictionary.

35:48.688 --> 35:50.898
Do you want some time to reflect alone?

35:51.607 --> 35:53.025
Are we supposed to wait outside?

35:53.943 --> 35:56.237
Of course, no problem. We leave.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.406
Get back to work!

35:59.157 --> 36:02.160
Feel free to read everything and think.

36:14.714 --> 36:18.092
The Chinese woman doesn't stop talking
about trust.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.635
They are considering

36:19.719 --> 36:22.221
ask the Japanese
to cancel the operation.

36:25.725 --> 36:26.934
Boss,

36:27.643 --> 36:29.520
Instead of standing still, we...

36:30.062 --> 36:32.190
Don't let them open their mouths.

36:33.733 --> 36:36.235
Gicheul, Jungbae was arrested.

36:36.903 --> 36:38.362
-What?
-And now?

36:39.447 --> 36:41.824
Damn cops!

36:47.496 --> 36:49.248
Circling!

36:49.332 --> 36:50.458
Get out of the way.

36:51.083 --> 36:52.877
Get out of the way.

36:52.960 --> 36:54.378
Get out of here.

36:55.129 --> 36:57.965
Get down from there!

36:58.049 --> 36:59.467
Turn off the music.

37:01.010 --> 37:04.180
-Let's get them out there.
-Group everyone on one side!

37:05.681 --> 37:07.183
-Fast!
-Get down from there!

37:10.228 --> 37:11.812
This is the police.

37:11.896 --> 37:12.772
Like this?

37:18.736 --> 37:20.696
If you cooperate, we won't be long.

37:20.780 --> 37:22.281
Stop now!

37:23.074 --> 37:25.326
Tramp, don't do anything.

37:25.409 --> 37:26.869
Turn around and stand still.

37:26.953 --> 37:27.954
Get him!

37:29.288 --> 37:30.414
Come here!

37:30.498 --> 37:32.083
-Hold on tight.
-Let me go!

37:33.292 --> 37:35.211
What the fuck are you doing?

37:36.295 --> 37:37.713
Well, what do you think?

37:37.797 --> 37:38.839
Treasure hunt.

37:42.343 --> 37:43.511
Here it is.

37:45.054 --> 37:46.055
Shit.

37:52.103 --> 37:53.020
Cum...

38:06.784 --> 38:07.743
Officer Choi.

38:13.332 --> 38:17.253
Man, I'm so envious
of these famous people's lives.

38:18.045 --> 38:18.879
Damn...

38:26.804 --> 38:28.139
Excuse me sir.

38:28.222 --> 38:29.056
Chord.

38:29.765 --> 38:31.183
What...

38:31.267 --> 38:32.768
Chord.

38:36.814 --> 38:38.107
What?

38:40.318 --> 38:41.444
We're from the police.

38:41.527 --> 38:43.279
You logo!

38:43.362 --> 38:44.947
-How dare you?
-Cum!

38:45.031 --> 38:46.657
-What?
-Get your hands off me.

38:46.741 --> 38:48.117
I already told you to get out of the way.

38:48.909 --> 38:50.202
Holy shit!

38:56.208 --> 38:58.252
-Come on, come on.
-Son of a bitch.

38:59.462 --> 39:01.213
Ignore people.

39:01.297 --> 39:02.381
Continue thinking.

39:06.469 --> 39:08.971
-What?
-Collect your urine.

39:11.390 --> 39:13.768
Who told you about me?

39:13.851 --> 39:17.104
Who was the idiot that told on me?

39:17.438 --> 39:19.190
In that other room,

39:19.273 --> 39:22.526
is the owner of Tae-ho Rock Cafe,
Choi Jungbae.

39:23.152 --> 39:24.153
You know who you are.

39:24.570 --> 39:27.073
He also attended
Yeoksam High School, right?

39:29.408 --> 39:30.242
Shit!

39:32.495 --> 39:33.788
Sir, we're done.

39:35.331 --> 39:38.125
If you're not going to talk,
you'd better go home and rest.

39:42.421 --> 39:43.923
What it was?

39:44.006 --> 39:46.217
You're not a suspect, you're just a witness.

39:46.300 --> 39:48.177
If you don't have anything to say, you can go.

39:51.889 --> 39:53.641
-Give me a cigarette.
-There is no more.

39:53.724 --> 39:55.684
Go buy. You're rich.

40:11.075 --> 40:12.576
What did you tell the police?

40:13.244 --> 40:16.914
What could I have said?

40:18.874 --> 40:20.376
They were the ones who brought it up.

40:21.293 --> 40:23.921
They talked about rumors
of meth sales

40:24.004 --> 40:25.589
and they asked me about it.

40:26.048 --> 40:27.049
And there?

40:31.846 --> 40:33.264
I did not say anything.

40:38.978 --> 40:40.771
Then they ransacked the nightclub.

40:48.195 --> 40:49.196
So that means...

40:51.031 --> 40:52.700
that I am to blame for this?

40:58.414 --> 41:00.166
Get out! I need to talk to him.

41:00.958 --> 41:02.126
What the hell is that?

41:02.376 --> 41:04.837
Gicheul!

41:04.920 --> 41:07.673
-Choi Jungbae, bastard!
-What is it?

41:07.756 --> 41:09.592
How dare you tell on me?

41:09.675 --> 41:11.260
Son of a bitch!

41:11.343 --> 41:14.722
How dare you fuck up the life
of a former colleague, you asshole?

41:14.805 --> 41:17.558
What bullshit is this?
I didn't tell on anyone, idiot!

41:17.641 --> 41:20.269
You told the police
that I use drugs, you bastard!

41:20.352 --> 41:22.646
Did you go crazy or smell glue?

41:23.105 --> 41:24.940
I didn't tell on shit!

41:25.024 --> 41:26.734
Yeah, I went crazy, broke in!

41:26.817 --> 41:28.319
If it weren't for my lawyer,

41:28.402 --> 41:31.071
I would have fucked myself today, asshole!

41:32.406 --> 41:33.657
Gicheul,

41:33.741 --> 41:35.993
fix this bastard!

41:38.829 --> 41:40.748
Everyone leave except Jungbae.

41:42.666 --> 41:43.792
Get out!

41:55.721 --> 41:57.473
Now that we're alone,

41:58.974 --> 42:00.309
tell me the truth.

42:05.272 --> 42:09.818
Didn't think it was strange
when they released Kwon Seungho,

42:09.902 --> 42:12.363
But do you find it strange when they let me go?

42:18.410 --> 42:20.371
I did not say anything.

42:21.247 --> 42:23.582
And why did they release you?

42:24.291 --> 42:26.794
Seriously, Gicheul, it's done.

42:28.045 --> 42:30.839
You know I never lied to you.

42:31.298 --> 42:32.466
He is sure?

42:32.550 --> 42:33.926
Gicheul.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.436
It's a second accounting book for the nightclub.

42:47.648 --> 42:48.857
Explain.

42:52.403 --> 42:53.779
-Jungbae.
-Say.

42:55.239 --> 42:57.199
Were you pocketing money?

42:58.742 --> 43:00.578
Did you look for my information?

43:00.661 --> 43:01.745
Did you really think...

43:03.706 --> 43:06.959
that I wouldn't find out
that you're selling my stuff?

43:07.042 --> 43:08.127
Your things?

43:08.210 --> 43:09.211
Our things.

43:09.545 --> 43:10.629
What?

43:10.713 --> 43:14.091
When the drug runs out,
addicts turn away.

43:14.174 --> 43:17.011
I only stocked up a little as a precaution.

43:19.597 --> 43:21.181
You should have told me.

43:21.265 --> 43:23.767
As if you would agree
if I had spoken.

43:24.268 --> 43:25.978
Was it for that reason?

43:28.022 --> 43:30.190
Then bring what you missed.

43:33.944 --> 43:35.446
Bring it to me.

43:38.824 --> 43:42.161
Did you think I wouldn't know
you were pocketing it?

43:53.464 --> 43:58.302
Take all your money.
Go to some very distant interior.

43:59.470 --> 44:01.347
And stay away from the police.

44:22.785 --> 44:23.869
Why?

44:25.245 --> 44:31.710
Can't I want
to make money too?

44:33.087 --> 44:34.963
I also have ambitions.

44:36.548 --> 44:38.717
Why can't I be successful like you?

44:44.890 --> 44:46.642
You can do whatever you want,

44:47.976 --> 44:49.853
But you can't lie to me.

44:51.772 --> 44:53.023
I understood.

45:11.709 --> 45:13.544
Serious? After 20 years?

45:22.886 --> 45:26.181
Are you going to kick me out for this?

45:27.766 --> 45:30.227
It's me you need
by your side now.

45:32.604 --> 45:33.605
Gicheul...

45:35.190 --> 45:39.528
Your perception is distorted.
It's Yu Euijeong's fault, the disgusting police officer!

45:39.611 --> 45:40.612
I am wrong?

45:41.613 --> 45:42.990
Come to mouth.

45:44.950 --> 45:46.577
Otherwise I'll kill you.

45:47.995 --> 45:51.790
I don't hang around cops.
Different from you!

45:52.624 --> 45:55.961
And she still insists on Kwon Seungho
just because he's close to her!

46:00.841 --> 46:02.926
There are strange things happening here,

46:03.010 --> 46:04.678
but you never suspected him!

46:06.805 --> 46:10.142
I'm not the one who should be expelled!

46:10.225 --> 46:12.019
It's Yu Euijeong and Kwon Seungho!

46:30.078 --> 46:32.414
One day, you will realize that you were blind.

46:33.874 --> 46:34.917
I guarantee.

47:03.195 --> 47:04.571
Look into my eyes.

47:07.491 --> 47:09.785
You're thinking about a lot of things, right?

47:11.161 --> 47:13.664
Go in peace, sir.

47:20.921 --> 47:22.506
You look good in that suit.

47:27.928 --> 47:29.596
Let's go in and take care of the boss.

47:30.472 --> 47:31.515
Where are you going?

47:33.809 --> 47:37.062
He said we needed to move forward
or expel someone.

47:37.855 --> 47:38.939
Got it, sir.

48:16.977 --> 48:17.978
Who is it?

48:19.229 --> 48:20.397
It's Kwon Seungho.

48:21.481 --> 48:22.482
In between.

48:39.124 --> 48:40.167
Boss.

48:44.379 --> 48:46.048
Must be upset

48:47.841 --> 48:49.301
because of Jungbae.

48:51.303 --> 48:54.431
I know how you feel,
but shouldn't we go back...

48:56.642 --> 48:58.143
the negotiations from before?

49:07.361 --> 49:08.528
I need to remain firm.

49:10.697 --> 49:11.782
Yes sir.

49:17.454 --> 49:18.497
Answer.

49:20.082 --> 49:21.500
Hello? Kwon Seungho speaking.

49:21.583 --> 49:23.251
Hi, it's Haeryun.

49:25.921 --> 49:26.964
Oi, Haeryun.

49:27.089 --> 49:29.007
You are with Mr. Jung, right?

49:29.424 --> 49:30.425
I am.

49:34.930 --> 49:36.974
I was about to call you.

49:37.265 --> 49:38.600
I thought we'd get together

49:38.684 --> 49:41.520
to clear everything up
and talk about future plans.

49:42.104 --> 49:44.439
How can we think about the future?

49:45.357 --> 49:47.484
with such an uncertain gift?

49:48.026 --> 49:51.446
All this confusion started from here.
My apologies.

49:51.530 --> 49:55.283
Aren’t others usually the
ones apologizing on your behalf?

49:55.701 --> 49:57.244
If I have time left,

49:58.370 --> 50:00.831
I will personally accept
Seungho's apology.

50:01.248 --> 50:02.749
Could it be?

50:04.501 --> 50:05.794
Just schedule the time.

50:06.753 --> 50:08.755
Wouldn't that be nice, Seungho?

50:11.508 --> 50:14.636
Clear. Just tell me the time,
and I'll be there.

50:16.138 --> 50:17.681
I'll call again later.

50:20.017 --> 50:21.393
Let's go out together.

50:25.439 --> 50:27.315
What does she want?

50:27.399 --> 50:30.360
Whatever it is, it's positive for us.

50:30.444 --> 50:33.321
Lee Haeryun is giving us
an opportunity.

50:34.990 --> 50:36.033
Boss,

50:36.908 --> 50:38.577
I will do whatever it takes

50:39.202 --> 50:43.290
to make her change her mind.

50:43.915 --> 50:45.459
I promise

50:47.878 --> 50:49.463
that I won't disappoint you.

50:53.759 --> 50:54.843
Right.

50:57.637 --> 50:59.765
I also don't want any more disappointments.

51:39.346 --> 51:41.264
You seem happy.

51:43.016 --> 51:44.976
Can I at least leave in peace?

51:45.268 --> 51:46.436
Hey, chubby.

51:47.479 --> 51:50.232
You always take the easy way out.

51:50.315 --> 51:52.484
That's why he gained so much weight.

51:53.777 --> 51:55.153
Go down the stairs.

51:57.322 --> 51:59.616
Oh no! The elevator broke.

52:12.838 --> 52:14.673
Holy shit, you piece of shit!

52:26.643 --> 52:28.019
Son of a bitch!

52:28.103 --> 52:29.229
Fucking asshole!

53:00.719 --> 53:02.762
Boss Seo, wait!

53:25.952 --> 53:27.829
Shit!

53:29.915 --> 53:31.583
You needed a good spanking

53:32.918 --> 53:36.880
to never think
about coming back here again, you piece of shit.

53:51.770 --> 53:52.896
Listen.

53:54.522 --> 53:57.317
Never set foot in this neighborhood again.

54:28.139 --> 54:34.145
Son of a bitch!

54:53.540 --> 54:54.541
Hey.

54:54.624 --> 54:56.126
What is in the church today?

54:57.252 --> 55:00.463
How about going in alone?
I stay here waiting.

55:01.715 --> 55:05.552
It's not good to see us together, right?

55:07.262 --> 55:08.596
What is happening?

55:09.639 --> 55:12.392
She was very quick in the kitchen.

55:14.394 --> 55:17.397
He got the reputation of being an incredible person.

55:18.273 --> 55:20.650
When they suggested creating a petition

55:20.734 --> 55:23.486
to bar the institution
for people with disabilities,

55:23.570 --> 55:25.572
Theresa didn't mince words.

55:25.655 --> 55:27.240
And truth.

55:27.657 --> 55:31.411
Whenever she saw a child,
she would give them a pencil as a gift.

55:31.494 --> 55:32.912
She had this sweet way.

55:34.080 --> 55:36.583
The Theresa Hwang Jinsook I knew

55:36.666 --> 55:39.336
shone like a jewel,

55:39.419 --> 55:43.548
but he always gave room
for others to shine.

55:43.631 --> 55:46.384
And where is dear Theresa now?

55:47.969 --> 55:50.430
In everyone's memory.

55:50.513 --> 55:52.265
Her daughter is here today.

55:53.391 --> 55:56.978
Then, take a moment
to talk to her.

55:57.062 --> 55:59.606
Share memories of Theresa with her.

56:00.899 --> 56:05.362
That way, she will live forever.

56:08.365 --> 56:10.658
We ask that you pour out your mercy

56:10.742 --> 56:13.828
about those who mourn
the loss of their loved ones.

56:13.912 --> 56:16.998
Surround them with your love and compassion

56:17.082 --> 56:19.584
and wipes your tears.

56:20.377 --> 56:23.797
As believers in your life and resurrection,

56:23.880 --> 56:26.299
we affirm that death is not the end,

56:26.383 --> 56:30.011
but the beginning
of a new and eternal existence.

56:33.264 --> 56:35.600
They didn't need to have done that.

56:35.683 --> 56:37.560
Of course we needed it.

56:37.644 --> 56:41.356
We have attended church together
for over 20 years.

56:42.565 --> 56:44.484
How is your older brother?

56:44.859 --> 56:48.071
He and my son Changdae
said they were going to the library,

56:48.154 --> 56:49.572
but they would always get ready.

56:50.907 --> 56:52.826
He is fine.

56:52.909 --> 56:55.870
You haven't changed a bit.
She looks like the same young woman as always.

56:56.788 --> 57:00.208
I was sad that I couldn't
go to her funeral.

57:00.291 --> 57:02.627
But Gicheul asked us

57:02.710 --> 57:04.462
that we organized this.

57:10.593 --> 57:12.011
Thank you, ma'am.

57:14.848 --> 57:17.809
You haven't changed a bit.
She looks like the same young woman as always.

57:19.561 --> 57:21.271
How is your older brother?

57:21.855 --> 57:25.066
He and my son Changdae
said they were going to the library,

57:25.150 --> 57:26.651
but they would always get ready.

57:28.111 --> 57:29.779
He is fine.

57:38.746 --> 57:39.747
Hello?

57:40.165 --> 57:41.541
It's Jung Gicheul speaking.

57:41.666 --> 57:43.042
Hello, Mr. Jung.

57:43.126 --> 57:44.919
What did Jungbae want to know?

57:45.295 --> 57:47.297
If Yu Euijeong lived in Wonju,

57:47.630 --> 57:49.883
if he studied at the same school
as Kwon Seungho

57:51.050 --> 57:52.385
and whether they were neighbors.

57:52.927 --> 57:54.387
I want you to discover this.

57:54.512 --> 57:55.513
Now?

57:55.597 --> 58:00.101
I don't think she ever moved to Wonju
and always lived in Seoul.

58:00.185 --> 58:01.895
Sim, Sr. Jung.

58:18.620 --> 58:19.787
Thanks.

58:40.475 --> 58:41.476
Euijeong.

58:42.727 --> 58:44.229
Let's stay another hour.

58:45.647 --> 58:46.814
Why?

58:47.565 --> 58:48.942
I want to be at peace...

58:50.652 --> 58:52.654
admiring your face for an hour.

58:56.491 --> 58:57.784
Captain Seok called.

58:58.451 --> 59:00.328
He said they are in a cafe.

59:01.955 --> 59:03.414
And where were they before?

59:03.498 --> 59:06.125
He mentioned a church,
but I'm not sure.

59:15.969 --> 59:17.929
-Hello?
-Hello, sir. It is me.

59:18.012 --> 59:19.180
Oh, Sr. Lee.

59:19.264 --> 59:21.015
That detective Cheon came here.

59:22.308 --> 59:24.102
He asked me to check

59:24.185 --> 59:27.021
whether retired police officer Yu Dukhoon
worked in Gangwon.

59:27.855 --> 59:29.816
When I said I couldn't,

59:29.899 --> 59:33.027
He said he would find out
at the Retired Police Officers Association.

59:33.403 --> 59:35.905
Will Gicheul
take Euijeong hostage...

59:44.706 --> 59:46.207
PRESS

59:51.212 --> 59:55.425
I'm writing an essay
about former police officer Yu Dukhoon.

59:55.508 --> 59:57.385
I need a lot of information.

59:57.468 --> 59:59.846
RETIRED POLICE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION

59:59.929 --> 01:00:01.514
My workday will end.

01:00:02.307 --> 01:00:03.850
Is it urgent?

01:00:03.933 --> 01:00:07.061
I understand. You need to go home, right?

01:00:08.187 --> 01:00:09.981
By the way, it seems...

01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:13.860
that he was never...

01:00:14.986 --> 01:00:16.946
in Gangwon Province.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:24.203
It's a great discovery.

01:00:48.227 --> 01:00:50.104
Hello.

01:00:50.188 --> 01:00:53.900
Is your name Cheon Jinpyung by any chance?

01:00:53.983 --> 01:00:54.984
It is me.

01:00:55.068 --> 01:00:56.110
You know me, right?

01:00:57.445 --> 01:00:59.530
Mr. Jung sent me here.

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:07.455
Can we talk for a moment?

01:01:07.538 --> 01:01:08.539
Clear.

01:01:18.007 --> 01:01:20.510
Why talk in the rain?

01:01:22.011 --> 01:01:25.431
By the way, what documents are these?

01:01:26.015 --> 01:01:28.685
These? Why the question?

01:01:28.768 --> 01:01:30.937
I'm just following orders from my boss.

01:01:31.938 --> 01:01:34.774
I'd better ask him.

01:01:37.443 --> 01:01:38.695
Do not wait.

01:01:39.278 --> 01:01:40.405
What are you doing?

01:01:40.488 --> 01:01:43.241
I want to see the documents first.

01:01:45.576 --> 01:01:48.413
I already said there's nothing.

01:01:48.496 --> 01:01:49.497
Drugs!

01:01:58.005 --> 01:01:59.006
Holy crap!

01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:01.759
What the hell is that?
Give me these documents right away.

01:02:02.176 --> 01:02:05.596
Who are you, anyway?

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:07.473
The order came from my boss!

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:09.225
Give me those documents now!

01:02:09.308 --> 01:02:10.768
Not even fucking that came from him.

01:02:11.477 --> 01:02:13.396
This is bullshit. Listen.

01:02:13.479 --> 01:02:16.774
What makes a police officer pretend
to work for a criminal?

01:02:19.193 --> 01:02:20.862
Veteran police officer Park Junmo.

01:02:20.945 --> 01:02:22.196
Genro do Yu Dukhoon.

01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:25.783
What confusion are you creating?

01:02:38.045 --> 01:02:40.923
Cheon Jinpyung,
if you continue to be a doormat for bandits,

01:02:41.007 --> 01:02:43.217
will end up in prison.

01:02:43.301 --> 01:02:46.929
I will protect you sir

01:02:47.013 --> 01:02:48.431
if you cooperate with the police.

01:02:49.223 --> 01:02:51.058
"Cooperar"?

01:02:51.142 --> 01:02:53.770
Of course I will cooperate.
I'll go the fuck!

01:02:56.397 --> 01:02:57.440
Son of a bitch!

01:03:16.751 --> 01:03:18.628
Son of a bitch!

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:22.423
Cum!

01:03:47.114 --> 01:03:48.157
Fuck!

01:04:43.462 --> 01:04:44.463
Help me.

01:04:46.465 --> 01:04:47.633
Get off of me.

01:04:55.141 --> 01:04:58.352
VETERAN POLICE PARK JUNMO

01:05:06.527 --> 01:05:07.987
Gicheul.

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:09.488
I must go now.

01:05:13.826 --> 01:05:16.787
See you. Thanks for today.

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:50.279
The number you dialed...

01:09:47.892 --> 01:09:49.894
