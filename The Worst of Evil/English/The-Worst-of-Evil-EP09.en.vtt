14:53.767 --> 14:55.769
You had a hard time, kids?

14:55.853 --> 14:58.731
We are mainly treating those in critical condition.

Today's work

I couldn't help it either

17:22.458 --> 17:23.459
our investigation

17:26.170 --> 17:27.963
It's a dangerous investigation that requires risking one's life.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.131
So please

17:30.257 --> 17:32.634
I'm asking you to stay out of this case.

will quickly conclude the investigation.

Well, I couldn’t eat dinner.

18:22.851 --> 18:23.852

(Kichul) Come in

18:39.493 --> 18:40.702

we?

19:00.722 --> 19:01.890
go in first

19:02.683 --> 19:03.934
Let's see each other for a few days

[Japanese] Should a father
apologize to his child?

19:13.986 --> 19:15.571
You're bold

What are you going to say to Oyabun?

19:25.080 --> 19:26.165
[Sound of putting it down]

19:35.883 --> 19:38.343
(Gi-cheol) [Korean] China
plans to double the volume

19:39.052 --> 19:40.262
Why did you accept it?

19:40.345 --> 19:43.724
During the last transaction,
we were unable to process the quantity due to a mistake on our part.

19:44.558 --> 19:46.560
I heard there is a lot of stock left .

19:46.685 --> 19:47.519
[Junmo’s sigh]

19:47.603 --> 19:49.938
(Junmo) This time we
have to accept that amount.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.024
Won't broken trust
be restored?

19:53.442 --> 19:55.694
But the volume has increased so much
that I have to process it all.

19:56.987 --> 19:58.739
It wouldn't be easy if it weren't for Japan.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.241
president

20:03.785 --> 20:05.787
Aren't you speaking too strongly to Japan ?

20:09.208 --> 20:11.376
All this time, I called Kanemoto
my father.

20:12.127 --> 20:13.212
[sigh]

20:13.295 --> 20:15.464
(Kichul) But because of that bastard,
not only us

20:16.465 --> 20:18.133
Even Uijeong’s older sister almost died.

20:19.259 --> 20:20.260
I did this

20:21.428 --> 20:22.804
I can never just get over it

20:22.888 --> 20:25.098
No, Uijeong-i watched the whole thing.
Is this okay?

20:25.182 --> 20:26.808
But I'm still a police officer

20:26.892 --> 20:28.268
You don't have to worry

20:30.520 --> 20:31.897
Now you're mine

20:33.941 --> 20:35.943
[Meaningful music]

[Whispering] Oh, what a surprise.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.396
(Democrat) Ah…

21:13.647 --> 21:14.815
What is it, the brother I haven’t seen before?

21:14.898 --> 21:16.858
Oh, I'm the boss' subordinate.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.027
(Minjoo) Ah, yes

21:25.367 --> 21:26.576
Isn't that strange?

21:27.619 --> 21:30.205
There is no one this handsome around my brother.

21:31.373 --> 21:32.499
[Minjoo’s light laughter]

21:32.582 --> 21:34.960
Ah, humor
[laughter]

21:35.043 --> 21:36.962
Oh, except for my brother Taeho.

21:37.045 --> 21:39.381
I've never brought anyone home before.

21:40.716 --> 21:41.800
that's interesting

21:48.181 --> 21:49.182
Mr. subordinate

21:51.351 --> 21:52.519
(Junmo) Yes

21:53.979 --> 21:56.148
Please be careful not to get stabbed by my brother.

21:57.899 --> 21:59.318
(Minjoo) Although we only see each other occasionally

22:00.152 --> 22:02.821
I don't want to hear about you on the 9 o'clock news.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.157
then

22:05.782 --> 22:06.867
I'm done

22:06.992 --> 22:09.578
I'm going to study before my brother wakes up.

22:16.668 --> 22:19.087
[Sound of door opening and closing]

22:19.921 --> 22:20.922
[Junmo’s sigh]

22:33.894 --> 22:35.687
(Chang-sik) You know, Chief, right?

22:36.480 --> 22:40.108
There was a war between the Gangnam Union and the Reconstructionists.

22:41.318 --> 22:44.696
Don't make it into an incident for now.

22:44.780 --> 22:45.781
quietly

22:45.864 --> 22:47.574
Please bury me quietly.

22:51.119 --> 22:54.790
I
will make a special request for your cooperation to the chief.

22:54.873 --> 22:55.874
ruler

23:03.423 --> 23:05.467
(Jongryeol) If you don’t send the goods to Japan,

23:05.550 --> 23:08.011
Do we
have to digest all 16 kg?

23:08.095 --> 23:11.348
(Heesung) Hey, look at the Rok Cafe Taeho getting robbed last time.

23:11.932 --> 23:14.184
I'm scared to death to even spray 1kg in Gangnam.

23:14.267 --> 23:15.769
As long as Ganttaeng doesn't come out of his stomach

23:15.852 --> 23:17.771
Where and how do you spread 16kg?

23:18.271 --> 23:20.273
How to dispose of things is a problem later.

23:20.857 --> 23:22.567
Yesterday we all almost died

23:23.652 --> 23:26.405
I really need to get an apology from that bastard Kanemoto.

23:27.906 --> 23:29.658
(Hee-seong) That, Yoo Yu-jeong

23:29.741 --> 23:32.077
I thought they were police because of this incident.

23:32.160 --> 23:33.662
How should I explain it?

23:33.745 --> 23:34.913
(Kichul) Tell the truth

23:35.747 --> 23:37.082
It's okay, don't worry

23:37.916 --> 23:39.251
(Junmo) Me, boss

23:40.001 --> 23:42.838
Do you mind if I meet the Japanese people in the hotel
first?

23:42.921 --> 23:44.339
Didn't you hear me?

23:45.549 --> 23:48.760
No, even when you chase away rats,
don’t you give them a hole to escape?

23:48.844 --> 23:50.637
(Junmo) So, Japanese bastards,
to Oyabung

23:50.720 --> 23:52.722
Tell the story well
[Meaningful music]

23:52.806 --> 23:55.225
Couldn’t someone
lighten the mood a bit?

23:55.308 --> 23:57.018
Hey, it's a matter of your boss' pride.

23:57.102 --> 23:58.186
What's important about the atmosphere?

23:58.270 --> 24:00.439
No, does your pride give you food? yes?

24:01.648 --> 24:03.525
(Junmo) We
made a mess like this

24:03.608 --> 24:05.735
The whole of Gangnam was eaten in one day.

24:06.278 --> 24:09.406
Everyone is watching us from all directions right now .

24:10.532 --> 24:13.452
In this case , how can you quietly dispose of the item without being noticed ?

24:13.535 --> 24:15.203
Fuck, really, it's only Japan.

24:16.413 --> 24:19.458
Receive the apology and complete the transaction.

24:19.541 --> 24:22.169
Shouldn't we go in a direction where both are possible ?

24:23.128 --> 24:24.129
president

24:26.006 --> 24:27.507
This is business

24:33.680 --> 24:35.056
(Mingu) Boss Jeong!

24:35.807 --> 24:38.018
Boss Jeong is good at fighting!

24:38.935 --> 24:41.354
Are you there today? huh?
[sound of kicking]

24:41.438 --> 24:42.355
hey!

24:43.523 --> 24:45.192
If you don't come out, we'll attack you!

24:46.359 --> 24:48.111
(Mingu) [Taking a breath] Hey…

24:48.987 --> 24:51.114
What does our boss Jeong
like?

24:51.198 --> 24:53.200
Even when I get stabbed like this, I hiss

24:53.283 --> 24:54.993
I don't know if they're trying to cover for each other.

24:55.076 --> 24:56.953
President Jeong, what, did you graduate from the Military Academy?

24:58.288 --> 24:59.331
how

24:59.998 --> 25:02.584
Did you pay a lot in condolences to our president Cheon Jin-pyeong
?

25:04.044 --> 25:05.504
Errand Center

25:05.587 --> 25:06.838
I

25:07.756 --> 25:11.885
I pulled up the phone call records from our late President Cheon’s office.

25:12.761 --> 25:15.180
Who was the last person you spoke to?

25:17.057 --> 25:19.476
It's you, fuck, Jeong Ki-cheol

25:19.559 --> 25:20.644
huh?
[Kichul laughs]

25:20.727 --> 25:21.895
what do you think about it?

25:22.229 --> 25:24.231
[dark music]

25:30.570 --> 25:32.489
No, I
had to run an errand because I needed to find out something.

25:33.657 --> 25:34.991
What's wrong with that?

25:35.075 --> 25:36.493
Wow, what

25:36.576 --> 25:40.914
Rather than being wrong,
it's just fucking scary, huh?

25:41.581 --> 25:44.334
President Chun died after I hung up the phone with you , huh?

25:44.960 --> 25:47.712
(Mingoo) Your junior
drug dealer, Yankee, has disappeared.

25:48.296 --> 25:50.257
His rival, Assistant Manager Cho, also died.

25:51.216 --> 25:52.467
Well, at this point

25:52.551 --> 25:54.135
What is happening around President Jeong?

25:54.219 --> 25:56.263
I wonder if there is a violent crime vending machine or something.

25:56.346 --> 25:57.889
I have reasonable doubt.

25:57.973 --> 25:59.140
fuck

26:02.352 --> 26:04.521
This is yours too, this

26:04.604 --> 26:05.605
huh?

26:12.320 --> 26:13.822
No, fuck it

26:16.199 --> 26:17.325
[Mingu’s sigh]

26:17.951 --> 26:19.661
No, but it's so fucking weird again

26:20.704 --> 26:23.331
The cell phone disappeared from President Cheon's belongings ?

26:25.834 --> 26:27.794
Did the person who sent the errand
take it too?

26:30.171 --> 26:31.673
or not

26:31.756 --> 26:33.425
Did the Yankees take it?

26:34.384 --> 26:36.303
Find the lighter's owner and ask him.

26:38.138 --> 26:40.265
That'll work, huh?

26:41.224 --> 26:42.267
(Mingoo) That’ll be fine then

26:43.351 --> 26:46.062
That'll work, huh?

26:47.188 --> 26:48.857
That'll be fine.
[Sound of door closing]

26:50.191 --> 26:52.319

[Meaningful music]

27:43.161 --> 27:44.204

Why did your boss chase CEO Cheon, who ordered him to work, to the rooftop?

27:55.674 --> 27:57.384
Why did you take President Cheon’s cell phone again?

27:59.010 --> 28:00.261
What do you mean?

28:00.970 --> 28:01.971

bring the fucking Yankees, huh?

killed CEO Cheon.

Can you tell me what's going on ?

29:14.335 --> 29:16.421
(Gi-cheol)
Because of the international free city business license

29:16.504 --> 29:17.964
They were competing kids.

29:19.674 --> 29:21.509
I guess they wanted to solve it their own way.

I'm really sorry

29:24.846 --> 29:27.098
I really wanted to show my sister a good side.

Should we continue with that risky business ?

quickly.

my name is engraved on it

will call me a thug

[Korean] We decided to receive double the quantity from China

31:27.010 --> 31:29.220
(Junmo) Well, because of this incident,
both Japan and us are affected.

31:29.804 --> 31:31.347

Oh my, if there is 500g of heroin

Even if you oil this thing, it
will last for ten years.

34:36.240 --> 34:37.283
Are you screwed?

34:37.366 --> 34:40.661
Mingu, I just
sold it.

I know, you bastard.

You know that's why I came, man

34:47.126 --> 34:49.921
Ah, for simple sales.

34:50.004 --> 34:52.340
(Mingu) The amount I possess is one hundredth.

34:52.423 --> 34:53.883
If it's 5g

34:54.884 --> 34:56.761
That's just a misdemeanor, isn't it?

34:57.929 --> 34:59.388
Hey Dodgers

36:26.184 --> 36:28.644
Mingu hyung, I’m really sorry.

Why on earth are you
doing such a sorry thing?

If you just tell me where it is,

36:50.458 --> 36:52.210
They say they will release you so you can fly freely.

36:52.293 --> 36:53.753
Why the fuck

Oh, and the Yankees, that bastard too

37:23.741 --> 37:25.952
You're pregnant and
need money, huh?

37:26.035 --> 37:28.037
Oh, just increase the number of things.

37:28.120 --> 37:31.582
They say they take all their customers away and
don't do business with them.

is also a druggie.

Very crazy bitch

37:45.096 --> 37:47.265
I guess drug addicts
are attracted to each other.

37:48.099 --> 37:49.141
(Mingu) Right?

37:49.475 --> 37:50.309
(Dodgers) Ah, boy…

Shouldn’t you have been there to meet me?

39:11.140 --> 39:12.391
I'm a little busy

39:12.475 --> 39:15.603
Are you going to insult me ​​now?

39:15.686 --> 39:17.396
Is it an insult?

[Dark music]
[Oyama's sigh]

49:08.487 --> 49:10.656
Now you can do business with me.

49:12.032 --> 49:13.158
[Haeryun laughs]

49:14.242 --> 49:16.954
(Haeryun) What is this situation now?

49:17.746 --> 49:18.830
With President Jeong

49:19.706 --> 49:21.166
The talk is over

49:21.249 --> 49:22.501
[sigh]

49:27.464 --> 49:29.007
(Junmo) No, this now

49:30.467 --> 49:33.804
Have you discussed this with our boss ? yes?

49:34.638 --> 49:35.764
(Ohyama) Now I

49:36.807 --> 49:38.976
I'll be President Jeong's new tomodachi.

49:40.435 --> 49:41.436
huh?

49:41.979 --> 49:42.980
How can I believe it?

49:43.063 --> 49:44.940
[laugh]

49:46.775 --> 49:48.193
I have to believe it

49:50.487 --> 49:51.530
Can you help me?

50:04.251 --> 50:05.293
[Oyama’s light laughter]

50:09.965 --> 50:11.967
[nervous music]

50:27.816 --> 50:28.817
It's neat

50:28.900 --> 50:31.111
You can believe it now, right?

50:33.405 --> 50:34.781
Thank you for your hard work

50:36.908 --> 50:39.077
(Kichul) Now that I’ve sorted out all the troublesome things,

50:40.328 --> 50:41.496
Let's start trading again.
