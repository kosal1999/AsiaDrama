(The characters, locations,
organizations and events in the play are purely fictitious)

00:13.013 --> 00:14.347
Who are you?

00:24.983 --> 00:27.235
How come you have this watch?

00:27.318 --> 00:30.739
I heard that Taihu would die if he messed around with you.

00:44.669 --> 00:46.880
Taihu never said he had a cousin

00:48.089 --> 00:52.343
Have you found Taihu's murderer?

00:52.427 --> 00:54.012
Is this what you came here to ask about?

00:55.055 --> 00:56.389
We are also looking for someone

00:56.473 --> 01:00.643
That's enough

01:00.727 --> 01:01.853
What did you just say?

01:01.936 --> 01:03.646
Really

01:03.730 --> 01:04.731
Don't do anything

01:14.365 --> 01:18.745
Why do you suddenly want to find Taihu when you have nothing to do?

01:18.828 --> 01:20.288
none of your business

01:21.623 --> 01:25.919
What the hell are you doing?

01:26.002 --> 01:27.879
My friend died

01:28.713 --> 01:32.217
Just looking at you bunch of losers makes me angry.

01:32.300 --> 01:34.552
Goddamn

01:34.636 --> 01:38.139
how?

01:38.223 --> 01:41.309
Are you really Taihu’s friends?

01:41.392 --> 01:42.644
Yes or no?

01:48.233 --> 01:50.777
What else are you scum doing?

01:51.277 --> 01:52.278
Is it right?

01:57.951 --> 01:59.202
where are you going?

01:59.869 --> 02:02.330
Of course we are looking for the bastard who killed Taihu.

02:02.914 --> 02:03.915
Then what?

02:03.998 --> 02:05.416
Cut him into pieces

02:13.883 --> 02:16.136
Come to my office another day

02:16.219 --> 02:17.387
Let’s talk about Taihu

02:24.561 --> 02:26.146
go away

02:31.818 --> 02:34.070
Do you really want to let him go like this?

02:47.125 --> 02:48.251
How about it?

02:48.918 --> 02:50.378
He asked me to go to his office

02:53.214 --> 02:54.465
Yeah?

02:54.549 --> 02:57.135
I acted very well

02:58.011 --> 02:59.345
Fool

03:04.434 --> 03:08.897
"Evil of Evils"

03:15.570 --> 03:18.114
I went to see Taihu last week

03:18.198 --> 03:20.450
The new tower is well maintained

03:21.159 --> 03:22.493
makes me very happy

03:23.203 --> 03:25.455
correct

03:26.623 --> 03:29.542
Why didn't Taihu mention that he had a cousin?

03:42.222 --> 03:44.432
Why don't you keep your gold watch?

03:45.475 --> 03:47.227
What should I do with a gold retention watch?

03:49.687 --> 03:51.898
I didn’t see half of their photos together

03:53.233 --> 03:54.234
Chenghao…

03:55.318 --> 03:58.363
There was no news about him after he went to work as a fisherman.

03:58.446 --> 04:00.949
He recently came back and asked me about Taihu

04:01.491 --> 04:04.244
My brother lives in Wonju

04:04.327 --> 04:07.038
When Taihu was in primary school

04:07.121 --> 04:10.124
Every summer, I go to Wonju to find Chenghao.

04:10.667 --> 04:13.711
They stick together all day like twins

04:13.795 --> 04:14.796
It is conceivable

04:16.256 --> 04:21.469
How shocked was he when he heard the news of Taihu's death?

04:27.183 --> 04:28.226
(Anti-Narcotics Division Shi Daoheng)

04:33.731 --> 04:35.984
I haven't used half of the money you gave me.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.443
Take the money and leave

04:45.326 --> 04:46.869
besides…

04:48.371 --> 04:51.124
Don't come back again

04:51.791 --> 04:53.793
When I see you, I think of Taihu

04:55.128 --> 04:59.007
will make me hate you

05:12.520 --> 05:16.024
The variable in the mission is that they may find Taihu's father

05:16.107 --> 05:18.067
Ask me something

05:18.526 --> 05:19.861
Please get ready

05:20.403 --> 05:23.031
(Karaoke bar, massage)

05:26.701 --> 05:27.952
(Zheng Qitie)

05:43.259 --> 05:45.470
Those little punks

06:04.781 --> 06:05.948
Hello

06:07.742 --> 06:09.786
Don't just stand, come and sit

06:25.051 --> 06:26.844
I am always thinking

06:28.971 --> 06:32.100
A cousin with whom I had no contact suddenly appeared

06:32.183 --> 06:34.394
Noisy restaurant

06:34.977 --> 06:37.063
What do you think the situation is?

06:40.983 --> 06:42.276
I see through your intentions

06:46.864 --> 06:47.949
take it

06:49.242 --> 06:51.869
Stop using his name to scam money.

06:52.495 --> 06:55.706
Even if you are his cousin, my patience has limits

06:57.291 --> 06:58.793
Take the money and get out

06:58.876 --> 07:01.838
You scumbags are really just hooligans

07:01.921 --> 07:02.964
What did you say?

07:04.590 --> 07:06.759
Do you think

07:08.469 --> 07:12.765
Will I be happy if I just take the money and leave?

07:12.849 --> 07:14.517
Son of a bitch

07:14.600 --> 07:15.852
do not get excited

07:15.935 --> 07:17.645
I can't stand it, come here

07:17.728 --> 07:19.147
-Please...
-How?

07:19.439 --> 07:21.607
You can't stand it? Come if you have the guts

07:23.484 --> 07:25.528
Want to know what happens next?

07:28.489 --> 07:30.825
Fuck you, second-rate gangster.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.417
Real or fake, are you blocking me again?

07:40.293 --> 07:41.752
Go away, asshole

07:48.009 --> 07:49.385
Don't do it all, idiot

07:49.469 --> 07:50.636
We are not punks

07:56.392 --> 07:57.435
Longda

07:57.518 --> 07:58.352
yes

08:04.609 --> 08:05.985
go to hell

08:06.986 --> 08:08.154
Son of a bitch

08:20.416 --> 08:21.876
hateful

08:30.676 --> 08:31.844
Damn thing

08:34.805 --> 08:36.349
hateful

08:37.725 --> 08:39.018
Everyone clean up

08:40.394 --> 08:41.479
yes

08:41.562 --> 08:43.564
What are you talking about?

08:50.655 --> 08:52.657
Who kicked me just now?

09:02.875 --> 09:03.960
asshole

09:05.920 --> 09:06.921
come down

09:07.004 --> 09:08.464
Kick you to death

09:11.801 --> 09:12.885
Son of a bitch

09:14.595 --> 09:16.681
Flesh feet

09:16.764 --> 09:20.643
useless waste

09:27.233 --> 09:28.734
asshole

09:30.236 --> 09:31.362
Damn it

09:34.574 --> 09:35.741
Go to hell

09:43.249 --> 09:46.419
Let me go, asshole

09:48.504 --> 09:50.756
Damn thing

09:50.840 --> 09:52.174
scrap material

09:52.258 --> 09:53.843
you this…

09:54.635 --> 09:56.470
little waste

09:56.554 --> 09:57.638
enough

10:13.821 --> 10:15.781
I don’t think you’re here to cheat money.

10:17.491 --> 10:20.870
Son of a bitch

10:25.916 --> 10:27.668
listen to me

10:27.752 --> 10:29.420
When my uncle helped me put on Taihu’s watch,

10:30.463 --> 10:33.257
Do you know what he said?

10:34.592 --> 10:37.678
He said wearing this watch feels like Taihu is with him

10:37.762 --> 10:40.014
don't take revenge

10:41.515 --> 10:42.683
But you know what?

10:44.685 --> 10:47.480
Thank you Taihu for treating you as friends

10:47.563 --> 10:49.899
I really feel sorry for him

10:53.444 --> 10:54.570
I…

10:56.030 --> 10:59.075
He will avenge Taihu at all costs

11:01.619 --> 11:03.788
You guys are a bunch of bastards

11:05.247 --> 11:09.377
Just clean this place and stay here

11:10.878 --> 11:12.129
I will find the murderer

11:12.213 --> 11:15.049
bring his head

11:26.352 --> 11:28.312
A bunch of unloyal bastards

11:48.332 --> 11:50.000
His name is Quan Chenghao?

11:50.084 --> 11:51.377
Yes, how?

11:52.628 --> 11:54.088
Do you want to join him?

11:55.047 --> 11:57.007
Just treat it as the reincarnation of Taihu

11:58.718 --> 11:59.885
What are you talking about?

12:00.720 --> 12:02.304
You also saw that he is good at fighting.

12:03.139 --> 12:05.015
One more person like Brother Xu

12:05.099 --> 12:07.601
Wouldn’t it be nice to have a strong thug?

12:07.685 --> 12:08.728
How can you trust him?

12:08.811 --> 12:11.856
He said he was Taihu’s cousin

12:11.939 --> 12:13.441
Nishinari

12:13.566 --> 12:17.027
When did you trust people so easily?

12:17.486 --> 12:18.654
Stop making trouble

12:19.196 --> 12:20.531
What did you say?

12:23.284 --> 12:24.493
you know what I mean

12:25.119 --> 12:27.413
Our business is not simple

12:27.496 --> 12:28.956
It's better to be careful

12:29.039 --> 12:30.624
Stop being so brainless

12:31.167 --> 12:32.543
No matter how big or small the guy is

12:36.005 --> 12:38.632
You love to pick on me lately

12:38.716 --> 12:41.260
Otherwise, what else is there to find? damn it

12:41.343 --> 12:42.470
damn it?

12:42.553 --> 12:44.430
damn it?

12:47.308 --> 12:48.893
Go do something quickly

12:52.813 --> 12:54.648
Okay, whatever you want to do

13:20.633 --> 13:23.219
Hello, have you seen this person?

13:25.012 --> 13:26.472
-Hello
-Hello

13:26.555 --> 13:27.473
Have you ever seen…

13:27.556 --> 13:31.227
Wasn't it great yesterday? Super cool

13:31.310 --> 13:32.311
yesterday…

13:32.394 --> 13:33.521
how?

13:35.940 --> 13:37.191
Isn’t that Quan Chenghao?

13:37.733 --> 13:39.443
That bastard

13:40.027 --> 13:42.613
-what? Don't pull me
- forget it

13:43.030 --> 13:44.365
follow me

13:46.325 --> 13:48.244
-Boss
-Hello

13:48.744 --> 13:50.287
What did he just ask you?

13:50.371 --> 13:54.333
Ask me if I have ever seen this person

13:54.416 --> 13:56.252
(Wanted murder suspect)

13:56.669 --> 13:59.088
- Call the police if you see him.
- Please give me a bowl of soup.

13:59.171 --> 14:00.339
-thank you
-go

14:00.422 --> 14:01.715
goodbye

14:01.799 --> 14:02.842
Hello

14:02.925 --> 14:04.426
Have you ever seen this person?

14:04.510 --> 14:06.971
If you see him please call the police

14:07.054 --> 14:08.889
That bastard

14:10.432 --> 14:12.685
Please call the police, thank you

14:19.650 --> 14:23.279
(Busan, South Korea)

14:50.180 --> 14:51.348
- Give it to me
- Yes, boss.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.275
very good

15:02.484 --> 15:03.485
Take it for lunch

15:04.236 --> 15:05.237
Thank you boss

15:09.158 --> 15:10.242
Walk

15:31.639 --> 15:32.681
haven't seen you for a long time

15:32.765 --> 15:34.099
asshole

15:35.976 --> 15:37.227
Son of a bitch

15:37.311 --> 15:38.771
Wait a moment

15:39.688 --> 15:41.815
Calm down and listen to me

15:43.317 --> 15:45.235
I came here without telling Qi Tie

15:45.319 --> 15:47.029
I have something important

15:50.074 --> 15:52.201
I hit it off with you

15:52.284 --> 15:54.286
I really wish we were friends

15:55.371 --> 15:57.498
But at that time, classes were clearly defined

15:58.791 --> 16:00.084
I'm talking about you

16:00.709 --> 16:04.964
If you have something to say, say it directly and don't talk in circles.

16:05.047 --> 16:08.467
After listening to this, I will see if I want to stab you with this knife.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.552
Have you heard the rumors in the world?

16:10.636 --> 16:13.263
Is Qitie making a fortune recently?

16:13.347 --> 16:17.810
Don't ask around, just fart quickly

16:17.893 --> 16:20.396
He sends tens of millions in cash to the boss every month

16:20.479 --> 16:22.189
Think about how much he actually makes

16:22.815 --> 16:24.858
He will become arrogant after making a little money

16:25.484 --> 16:26.986
Now he looks down on people

16:27.069 --> 16:28.821
Thinking you are superior

16:28.904 --> 16:32.199
We have been friends for ten years, and he calls me back and forth

16:32.282 --> 16:34.493
Poor waste

16:35.536 --> 16:37.705
So embarrassing

16:39.123 --> 16:40.124
Han Tu

16:41.083 --> 16:43.085
Let's work together to get rid of Qi Tie

16:45.295 --> 16:48.215
You have a chance to take it back domineeringly

16:48.298 --> 16:50.217
previous territory

16:50.300 --> 16:52.928
We discouraged him so he couldn't work

16:53.012 --> 16:55.514
Take away his business

16:55.597 --> 16:57.808
I am familiar with all operations

16:58.434 --> 17:00.352
useless things

17:00.436 --> 17:03.480
You came all the way to betray your friends?

17:09.778 --> 17:13.741
We didn't have a wedding and my girlfriend is eight months pregnant

17:14.366 --> 17:18.162
I want to support my family, don’t people need to have great ambitions?

17:19.580 --> 17:22.666
You can ask the boss first

17:22.750 --> 17:24.710
Gather the old Busan gang again

17:24.793 --> 17:27.504
Then I will take care of the Jiangnan side

17:28.297 --> 17:29.673
It shouldn't be difficult

17:42.019 --> 17:45.272
To leave a message please press two

17:45.939 --> 17:47.483
Please leave a message

17:48.150 --> 17:50.569
Yi-jeong, I’m in Daegu

17:51.904 --> 17:54.656
A murder suspect fled here

17:55.240 --> 17:58.327
I'm going to stay and watch him until I catch him.

17:59.453 --> 18:01.080
don't worry too much

18:03.415 --> 18:05.209
I will leave another message

18:14.510 --> 18:15.719
Why so slow?

18:16.678 --> 18:18.305
Traffic jam on the road

18:23.435 --> 18:24.853
Pour me a drink

18:36.448 --> 18:39.118
Please nod, we promise not to fail

18:39.201 --> 18:41.411
We are direct descendants of the gang

18:41.495 --> 18:43.914
They are just street gangsters from Jiangnan

18:45.082 --> 18:47.167
There's no need to get angry over a few street gangsters

18:47.751 --> 18:51.505
You are born stupid

18:51.588 --> 18:55.634
Or were you being particularly stupid that day?

18:59.388 --> 19:02.516
You are your direct descendants, right?

19:03.058 --> 19:05.936
Qitie sends me money on time every month

19:06.395 --> 19:07.938
My Japanese sworn brothers also admire him

19:08.730 --> 19:11.066
Said no one was allowed to touch him

19:13.819 --> 19:15.237
to be honest

19:16.488 --> 19:18.365
You take over that area

19:19.658 --> 19:21.827
It doesn't make much difference to me

19:22.828 --> 19:24.621
You know Hong Xicheng, right?

19:24.705 --> 19:27.624
He is one of ours now, he will definitely get it done this time

19:28.709 --> 19:30.335
You let us take over Jiangnan

19:31.170 --> 19:33.255
We give you twice the money every month

19:37.467 --> 19:38.468
Zheng Qitie

19:38.552 --> 19:40.846
(Zheng Qitie)

19:43.056 --> 19:44.057
Zheng Qitie

19:55.986 --> 19:57.821
I'm Zheng Qitie, come out and meet me

20:13.420 --> 20:15.380
Wasn't there a rock and roll nightclub here before?

20:15.797 --> 20:19.301
It was left empty when it went bankrupt, and we later took it over.

20:20.510 --> 20:22.930
Qitie said that this area needs more young people to drive business

20:23.013 --> 20:24.473
He plans to open a new nightclub

20:24.556 --> 20:27.726
That stupid DJ really loves to dance and have carnivals

20:30.187 --> 20:32.231
Every time you sign a contract

20:32.314 --> 20:35.275
It is our tradition to celebrate together

20:36.276 --> 20:37.736
Just tonight

20:38.445 --> 20:40.030
Is everything ready?

20:41.031 --> 20:42.658
certainly

20:42.741 --> 20:44.451
Guaranteed to be foolproof

20:45.285 --> 20:48.622
The younger brother hid in three motels

20:49.248 --> 20:52.417
wait until the time is right

20:52.501 --> 20:55.379
They'll rush in in droves

20:57.214 --> 20:58.632
To deceive others

20:58.715 --> 21:00.175
Only one person can lead a guy, right?

21:00.717 --> 21:01.843
certainly

21:04.054 --> 21:05.847
Or should I bring the guy in first?

21:05.931 --> 21:07.683
What about hiding them inside?

21:10.978 --> 21:12.104
That's fine if you want

21:13.188 --> 21:14.481
Listen

21:14.564 --> 21:17.401
There is a small bar near the stage

21:17.484 --> 21:19.027
I'll put the weapons down there

21:20.445 --> 21:21.446
good

21:23.240 --> 21:24.366
And one more thing

21:25.117 --> 21:26.118
What's up?

21:28.453 --> 21:31.123
They are all my brothers

21:32.082 --> 21:33.250
please

21:34.209 --> 21:36.044
Don't be too harsh

21:36.128 --> 21:37.963
Don't kill anyone

21:38.880 --> 21:40.382
What words?

21:41.466 --> 21:42.968
That depends on how you arrange it

21:43.051 --> 21:46.388
We have no way to guarantee

21:46.471 --> 21:47.597
drive

21:47.681 --> 21:48.849
yes

22:37.105 --> 22:38.190
What are you doing?

23:00.879 --> 23:03.340
Han Tu, please

23:06.468 --> 23:08.053
You've found the right place

23:10.514 --> 23:11.848
What is this place?

23:12.307 --> 23:13.642
What tricks do you want to play?

23:13.725 --> 23:15.560
We're going to party here tonight

23:16.895 --> 23:18.105
In memory of Taihu

23:19.314 --> 23:22.776
I don't have time to listen to your nonsense

23:22.859 --> 23:23.819
carnival?

23:27.948 --> 23:31.785
I heard you are looking for Taihu’s murderer

23:33.745 --> 23:34.996
Keep the change, please

23:35.914 --> 23:37.541
join my gang

23:38.542 --> 23:41.378
I only opened my mouth because you are Taihu’s cousin.

23:58.311 --> 23:59.896
Want me to join your gang?

24:04.609 --> 24:05.652
Yeah?

24:08.029 --> 24:09.656
Then who wants to avenge Taihu?

24:11.783 --> 24:12.784
Let's go

24:34.347 --> 24:36.349
Qitie

24:39.436 --> 24:40.812
who are they?

24:41.605 --> 24:44.065
Brother Zhang killed Taihu, those are his people

24:47.360 --> 24:49.946
Where is the party going?

24:51.823 --> 24:53.116
That bastard Xicheng

24:53.909 --> 24:55.035
Han Tu

25:09.299 --> 25:11.551
damn it

25:13.345 --> 25:14.554
Seize Qitie

25:15.013 --> 25:16.431
beat them to death

26:08.149 --> 26:09.609
Son of a bitch

26:13.488 --> 26:14.489
waste

26:17.450 --> 26:20.036
Get that bastard, you loser

26:25.292 --> 26:26.626
go to hell

26:34.134 --> 26:35.218
asshole

26:35.302 --> 26:36.720
Who is this brat?

26:40.640 --> 26:43.268
That bastard...get up

26:43.351 --> 26:44.853
hurry up

27:01.620 --> 27:02.912
Good night

27:10.211 --> 27:12.380
Are you annoyed?

27:13.632 --> 27:14.966
kill them all

27:15.425 --> 27:16.593
Kill

28:09.354 --> 28:10.438
Offal

28:10.522 --> 28:11.981
Son of a bitch

28:14.484 --> 28:18.238
waste

28:18.321 --> 28:19.656
-I'm going to beat you to death
-That's enough

28:54.149 --> 28:55.275
You choose

28:56.901 --> 28:58.153
I'm going to die here

29:12.667 --> 29:14.335
Or don't let me see you again?

29:26.848 --> 29:28.057
tidy up

29:30.685 --> 29:32.103
I have no strength left, call it a day.

29:33.480 --> 29:36.065
Do not touch me

29:36.149 --> 29:37.901
Let it go, asshole

29:37.984 --> 29:39.986
take your hands away

29:40.069 --> 29:42.197
Told you not to touch me, you damn bastard

29:42.280 --> 29:43.281
let me go

29:43.364 --> 29:44.741
Han Tu

29:44.824 --> 29:47.243
- let me go
- bastard

29:58.713 --> 29:59.756
Han Tu

30:20.735 --> 30:21.778
Walk slowly without seeing anyone off

30:24.989 --> 30:26.032
asshole

30:26.115 --> 30:27.450
friend

30:28.785 --> 30:30.912
Get lost, asshole

30:33.623 --> 30:35.208
I see you were beaten badly

30:35.291 --> 30:37.335
Jiangnan is our home

30:38.169 --> 30:39.629
Don't come again

30:40.964 --> 30:42.215
sorry

30:42.799 --> 30:44.425
asshole

30:44.509 --> 30:46.427
- Han Tu, he's leaving
- bastard

30:46.511 --> 30:49.806
Don't come to our territory again, you country bumpkin.

30:51.850 --> 30:54.310
The blood stains are all gone. Wipe them off quickly.

30:54.394 --> 30:55.520
-Jae Hoon
-very good

30:55.603 --> 30:57.272
- mop it off
- good

30:57.355 --> 30:58.731
- do things quickly
- yes

31:00.316 --> 31:02.026
As expected, you expected it

31:02.110 --> 31:03.903
They all took the bait

31:05.488 --> 31:06.489
Thanks

31:06.573 --> 31:10.410
-Han Tu...
-Just asking out of curiosity

31:10.827 --> 31:13.621
Why did you call me here?

31:14.289 --> 31:15.748
Force me to fight?

31:17.125 --> 31:19.002
Would you like to tell him personally?

31:20.879 --> 31:22.171
Yes, boss

31:23.214 --> 31:24.632
I am Zheng Qitie

31:24.757 --> 31:27.677
So annoying

31:28.720 --> 31:31.097
I heard that you nodded to Brother Zhang’s younger brother

31:31.180 --> 31:32.348
sneak attack on me

31:35.351 --> 31:38.605
It’s a shame that I gave you so much money

31:39.397 --> 31:41.482
Isn't this very kind?

31:42.775 --> 31:44.652
I will never send money there again.

31:47.113 --> 31:48.698
Take care of yourself

32:01.044 --> 32:04.923
Go to Seoul and find Zheng Qitie

32:06.591 --> 32:10.803
Cut open his intestines and throw him into the sea of ​​Incheon

32:11.512 --> 32:13.056
No, wait

32:13.806 --> 32:19.479
Capture him, disembowel him in Busan, disembowel him and throw him into the sea

32:25.360 --> 32:26.694
one way or another

32:27.737 --> 32:29.739
Should I contact you?

32:29.822 --> 32:31.282
Kanemoto Rodai?

32:38.790 --> 32:42.043
You must be good at acting

32:42.126 --> 32:44.253
Only those bastards in Busan would believe it

32:49.926 --> 32:54.180
I want to get rid of the useless parasites in the gang

32:54.263 --> 32:55.264
Just use a trick within a trick

32:57.141 --> 32:59.018
There's a good reason for everything here

33:01.980 --> 33:03.606
So what?

33:04.524 --> 33:07.068
It's not my business?

33:08.361 --> 33:09.737
Where is Brother Zhang?

33:11.531 --> 33:13.533
Brother, it's all done

33:16.285 --> 33:17.328
Let’s talk after we go out

33:29.841 --> 33:30.842
yes

33:30.925 --> 33:32.176
lit

33:34.595 --> 33:38.558
(Taihu Rock Cafe)

33:39.308 --> 33:41.436
Taihu wanted to open a shop here during his lifetime

33:42.729 --> 33:45.982
It should have opened earlier, no one is here now

33:48.192 --> 33:49.235
Too tiger…

33:51.446 --> 33:53.448
like my brother

34:02.248 --> 34:05.835
I want you to help him fulfill his last wish

34:14.886 --> 34:15.928
i killed him

34:18.848 --> 34:21.392
That bastard Brother Zhang killed Taihu

34:22.351 --> 34:23.936
I chopped him into mincemeat

34:30.401 --> 34:33.529
My name is Quan Chenghao. Please give me your advice.

34:58.846 --> 35:01.766
Those who were dissatisfied with him are now wiped out

35:02.683 --> 35:05.728
He is the most junior, so he should be nicer to others, you know?

35:07.313 --> 35:08.439
-yes
-yes

35:10.191 --> 35:11.484
do you know?

35:11.567 --> 35:12.693
yes

35:14.237 --> 35:15.988
applause

35:19.325 --> 35:20.535
applause

35:52.984 --> 35:56.863
About Hyeon-dong and Yeoksam-dong

35:56.946 --> 35:58.197
Only these two areas belong to us

35:58.281 --> 35:59.657
Can't cross the line

35:59.740 --> 36:01.450
There is a boss in every district

36:01.534 --> 36:05.246
The job of the newcomer is to patrol the territory

36:05.329 --> 36:07.456
From five o'clock in the evening to five o'clock the next morning

36:07.540 --> 36:10.042
like a patrolman

36:10.126 --> 36:13.880
Check to see if there are any accidents or if anyone is causing trouble

36:13.963 --> 36:17.758
When you see people from other gangs, report it immediately, that's it

36:18.718 --> 36:19.802
Do you understand?

36:19.886 --> 36:21.470
Turn left over there

36:26.851 --> 36:32.690
By the way, why are you speaking so politely to me?

36:33.399 --> 36:36.569
I'm very polite to anyone who can fight.

36:36.652 --> 36:39.530
I've seen your skills

36:39.614 --> 36:44.619
Even Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee have to bow down.

36:44.702 --> 36:47.622
You are awesome

36:49.707 --> 36:51.876
Fight well

36:52.001 --> 36:53.586
Do you want to learn Taekwondo?

36:54.921 --> 36:57.590
-Are you sick?
-Who are you?

36:57.673 --> 36:59.425
I have the guts to fight

36:59.508 --> 37:01.886
Son of a bitch

37:01.969 --> 37:03.346
What's wrong with you?

37:16.025 --> 37:17.109
Don't be impulsive

37:18.444 --> 37:20.404
Damn thing

37:27.286 --> 37:29.997
- That bastard
- let's go, let's go

37:31.958 --> 37:33.417
What did you say?

37:35.461 --> 37:36.879
Good night

37:41.259 --> 37:42.343
Hello boss

37:43.177 --> 37:44.553
Long Da, keep up the good work

37:47.390 --> 37:49.725
How long will we be patrolling the streets like this?

37:50.643 --> 37:53.145
We don't have to patrol the streets until new people arrive.

37:54.146 --> 37:55.273
When was that?

37:55.356 --> 37:58.234
After graduating from high school

37:59.277 --> 38:00.528
It will take some time

38:02.071 --> 38:03.072
Hello

38:07.034 --> 38:09.161
-Hello, big brother
-Longda

38:09.245 --> 38:10.454
yes

38:10.538 --> 38:11.831
do things well

38:11.914 --> 38:13.207
do you know?

38:13.291 --> 38:14.500
Good night

38:18.504 --> 38:20.881
it hurts

38:21.632 --> 38:24.051
If you stay undercover until the end

38:24.135 --> 38:25.720
What if driving skills only get better?

38:26.554 --> 38:28.597
who knows

38:30.558 --> 38:33.894
I need to take a nap, call me later

38:33.978 --> 38:37.148
I have to patrol the streets again

38:39.066 --> 38:43.029
Most gangs charge so-called protection fees

38:43.112 --> 38:45.698
Each of our members runs a store

38:45.781 --> 38:48.409
Half of the profits are turned over to the company

38:48.492 --> 38:49.577
The system is quite advanced

38:49.702 --> 38:52.955
Do you sell catering or anything else?

38:54.165 --> 38:55.624
Something else? what?

38:56.042 --> 38:59.879
Gambling or other business

39:00.671 --> 39:04.925
You are the best in the gang, I am the second best

39:05.009 --> 39:06.427
How could I know

39:06.552 --> 39:09.013
I only know which nightclub has hot girls

39:09.096 --> 39:10.973
(Seoul Provincial Police Agency, South Korea)

39:11.057 --> 39:12.975
(Security Division)

39:41.670 --> 39:42.713
Mr. Cha Fengzhu

39:43.464 --> 39:47.593
If you violate the National Security Law, you will face three to five years in prison.

39:47.676 --> 39:49.345
Will be kicked out of university

39:49.428 --> 39:52.807
You will also have a criminal record when you go out to find a job.

39:52.890 --> 39:54.183
I do not know anything

39:57.061 --> 40:00.022
I just heard you say you were from Jeonju

40:02.024 --> 40:04.360
Me too, I go to Jeonju Girls' High School

40:06.904 --> 40:08.280
take it

40:08.364 --> 40:09.532
smoke one

40:10.366 --> 40:12.618
Asking a fellow countryman to smoke a cigarette is just a token of appreciation

40:20.668 --> 40:23.003
I rarely say this

40:29.093 --> 40:31.554
You know we asked your friends too

40:33.180 --> 40:37.309
Everyone says Bong-joo, you are the boss

40:38.727 --> 40:40.146
Not true?

40:47.445 --> 40:49.238
Can't you go home and sleep?

40:49.321 --> 40:53.576
Yes, my parents moved to Yishan

40:53.659 --> 40:55.870
So I have to move out

40:56.203 --> 40:57.580
Then please go take a shower

40:57.663 --> 40:59.457
Washed in the morning

41:00.416 --> 41:02.084
That was yesterday morning

41:02.168 --> 41:04.837
What the hell, it's still morning anyway

41:05.921 --> 41:08.090
Very hungry

41:26.442 --> 41:27.526
Hello

41:28.027 --> 41:29.487
Is it you who knocks 2473?

41:30.738 --> 41:32.490
Hello, Yingbi, this is Liu Yizhen.

41:32.573 --> 41:33.824
Junmo's wife

41:33.908 --> 41:36.660
Yi Zhen, hello

41:36.744 --> 41:37.828
How is it going?

41:37.912 --> 41:39.288
I'm fine, thank you for your concern

41:39.747 --> 41:42.500
There is no news about Junmo from yesterday to now

41:42.583 --> 41:43.959
I'm a little worried

41:45.377 --> 41:46.670
What?

41:46.754 --> 41:47.922
What's wrong?

41:49.381 --> 41:52.468
He had an asthma attack and called in sick.

41:58.140 --> 41:58.974
So hot

41:59.099 --> 42:01.018
To listen to the message please click

42:02.061 --> 42:03.687
Is it me, busy?

42:03.771 --> 42:06.649
I know you have asthma,
can we still have a meal together, right?

42:22.248 --> 42:23.165
that…

42:23.916 --> 42:27.086
My friend is in a hurry. I'll go have a meal and come back.

42:32.299 --> 42:33.384
It's only a woman

42:34.301 --> 42:35.302
It's a woman

42:35.636 --> 42:37.555
OK, who is it?

42:39.098 --> 42:40.432
Going on a double date with my girlfriend?

42:42.893 --> 42:44.478
Handsome ones are the most popular

42:44.562 --> 42:45.896
I don't eat instant noodles

42:46.855 --> 42:50.317
Yes, it’s better to eat with a woman

42:51.235 --> 42:53.988
I can eat instant noodles alone

43:01.203 --> 43:03.455
Yi Zhen, I'm sorry for not telling you earlier.

43:16.844 --> 43:18.220
Say it now

43:19.388 --> 43:20.889
What are you doing these days?

43:23.058 --> 43:25.436
Who bought you a suit without letting your wife know?

43:25.519 --> 43:26.687
you misunderstood

43:31.358 --> 43:36.739
To tell you the truth, I want to catch drug smugglers.

43:36.822 --> 43:38.824
Just go undercover and join the gang.

43:44.288 --> 43:46.749
they really said that

43:46.832 --> 43:48.709
What a nonsense

43:52.796 --> 43:53.714
Hello

43:54.882 --> 43:55.799
Chenghao

43:55.883 --> 43:57.426
-Yes
-What are you doing?

44:02.556 --> 44:04.808
Just eating with friends

44:05.351 --> 44:08.479
Wait, I saw her in high school

44:09.396 --> 44:10.898
Didn't expect to see you here

44:10.981 --> 44:12.274
haven't seen you for a long time

44:14.318 --> 44:15.319
haven't seen you for a long time

44:16.695 --> 44:18.906
She is my friend from elementary school

44:18.989 --> 44:20.741
We used to learn Taekwondo together

44:22.493 --> 44:23.702
Who is this…

44:24.328 --> 44:26.955
I recently joined the company as president

44:28.791 --> 44:30.042
Really?

44:30.459 --> 44:33.671
Qi Tie is a junior classmate of my high school church.

44:36.840 --> 44:38.092
Are you OK?

44:38.759 --> 44:40.636
Very good, thank you for your concern

44:41.887 --> 44:43.097
How are the police doing?

44:43.180 --> 44:44.807
Did you hear that?

44:46.975 --> 44:48.519
Which subject are you in?

44:49.561 --> 44:51.146
Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency Security Section

44:54.525 --> 44:56.110
Have you finished eating?

44:56.193 --> 44:57.194
Finished

44:58.487 --> 45:00.114
Can I take Chenghao away?

45:09.456 --> 45:12.793
I'm leaving. I'll call you later.

45:19.800 --> 45:22.219
How dare you meet with the policeman, bastard

45:22.302 --> 45:23.429
you misunderstood

45:23.512 --> 45:25.806
We have had a good relationship since elementary school

45:26.348 --> 45:28.308
My dad is a poisonous insect

45:28.392 --> 45:30.269
If he takes drugs, he will beat me

45:30.352 --> 45:33.063
I used to hide in her house

45:33.147 --> 45:35.691
Why are you contacting her, asshole?

45:36.191 --> 45:37.276
Go away

45:37.359 --> 45:39.403
I didn't contact her

45:40.696 --> 45:42.656
It was she who contacted me first

45:44.366 --> 45:47.161
Why did that female police officer contact you?

45:47.244 --> 45:49.121
My dad was caught taking drugs

45:51.206 --> 45:53.167
Now being held in the police station

45:57.045 --> 45:58.213
boss

46:00.257 --> 46:02.009
I really do not know

46:02.092 --> 46:04.261
You will meet Yi Zhen

46:04.344 --> 46:06.430
Do you have to blame me for this?

46:10.392 --> 46:11.560
Let's go

46:11.685 --> 46:13.145
-Chenghao
-Yes

46:20.986 --> 46:23.322
Have some respect for the boss, you bastard

46:25.657 --> 46:26.825
sorry

46:42.925 --> 46:44.676
It's me Yi Zhen

46:44.802 --> 46:47.763
Do you all know about Jun Mo’s drug investigation case?

46:53.060 --> 46:55.813
Chenghao, do you think I will believe you?

46:58.232 --> 47:00.567
I hate notes

47:00.651 --> 47:02.277
enough

47:10.327 --> 47:11.662
you need to know

47:12.621 --> 47:14.540
A cousin suddenly appeared in Taihu

47:14.873 --> 47:17.793
His neighbor happens to be…

47:17.876 --> 47:19.962
Oldest friend from high school church

47:20.587 --> 47:22.589
Don't you think it's strange?

47:25.342 --> 47:28.762
South Korea is really small, isn’t it?

47:31.431 --> 47:36.562
Qi Tie, where does she and you like the spicy fried rice cake?

47:40.274 --> 47:41.692
I think so

47:41.775 --> 47:44.695
She is his first love, they do everything together

48:16.560 --> 48:18.437
It's a necklace given by the high school church.

48:19.021 --> 48:20.606
should take it home

52:16.007 --> 52:18.009
