00:01.584 --> 00:08.591
THE CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS AND
EVENTS OF THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

00:10.760 --> 00:12.512
Stab him, you bastard!

00:14.931 --> 00:16.016
Damned.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.020
You know what?

00:21.021 --> 00:23.106
When Yongdae was here
on behalf of the boss,

00:23.189 --> 00:25.400
The bastard was already waiting here.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.569
And apparently, damn it,

00:27.652 --> 00:30.739
When you
were released from the hospital, he was there too.

00:31.489 --> 00:32.490
Hey.

00:33.533 --> 00:34.951
What is it with you two?

00:35.035 --> 00:36.036
Chief Seo.

00:38.788 --> 00:40.707
He has nothing to do with me.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.751
I really don't know anything. OK?

00:42.834 --> 00:44.502
Then it doesn't matter if he dies.

00:54.345 --> 00:55.972
Fucking asshole.

00:57.974 --> 00:59.684
You Hurensohn!

01:04.606 --> 01:06.316
Asshole!

01:07.150 --> 01:08.443
Of ...

01:09.444 --> 01:10.570
Motherfucker.

01:11.696 --> 01:13.073
You Hurensohn.

01:17.285 --> 01:18.953
It was you. You were the traitor.

01:19.496 --> 01:20.997
You lousy pig!

01:21.498 --> 01:22.499
Die!

01:28.880 --> 01:30.465
At three. One two three!

01:34.010 --> 01:35.887
- You dirty pig!
Son of a bitch!

01:35.970 --> 01:38.181
-Stand up!
-Let go, you bastard!

01:39.057 --> 01:41.309
-Seo Jongryeol, you wanker!
-Let go, you pigs!

01:41.392 --> 01:42.602
No! Drop them!

01:42.685 --> 01:44.729
-Out of the way!
-You asshole!

01:44.813 --> 01:46.689
-Let go of me, damn it!
-Stop!

01:48.149 --> 01:50.110
-Take him away!
-Let me go!

01:50.193 --> 01:53.154
-Kwon Seungho! You asshole!
-You bastard!

01:56.241 --> 01:59.202
Dohyung, are you ok?

01:59.285 --> 02:00.286
Dohyung!

02:00.870 --> 02:03.957
Dohyung! No!

02:04.791 --> 02:08.753
Call a damn ambulance! Come on!

02:10.130 --> 02:11.339
Dohyung.

02:11.422 --> 02:12.549
Junmo.

02:14.217 --> 02:16.427
You are a police officer.

02:18.096 --> 02:19.222
Never forget that.

02:19.305 --> 02:22.267
Yes OK. And now we're taking you
to a hospital.

02:22.350 --> 02:24.644
Put him on my back!

02:24.727 --> 02:26.312
Fuck!

02:28.773 --> 02:29.774
No!

02:33.820 --> 02:37.282
Hey, stay with us!
Hold on!

02:38.199 --> 02:44.956
THE WORST OF EVIL

02:51.337 --> 02:52.714
"Sports facilities."

02:52.797 --> 02:54.382
"Maritimer Tourismuskomplex"

02:57.051 --> 02:59.679
"Urbaner GrÃ¼npark."

02:59.762 --> 03:01.598
"Hightech-Industriebezirk."

03:02.265 --> 03:03.641
Choi Jungbae, you shithead.

03:03.725 --> 03:05.018
"Investitionsaufruf."

03:05.852 --> 03:09.022
"CEO Jung Gicheul."

03:10.315 --> 03:15.445
So you want to start over
as a clean businessman?

03:16.988 --> 03:18.865
We can't live like this forever.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.202
We also have to
live like decent people.

03:22.702 --> 03:25.580
I said there's no "we",
you lousy bastard.

03:28.541 --> 03:29.542
We?

03:31.753 --> 03:34.172
Are we also included
in this plan?

03:49.020 --> 03:50.104
Gicheul.

03:53.524 --> 03:55.193
Do you know our boys' names?

03:55.860 --> 03:58.446
Do you know them all?

04:02.700 --> 04:03.952
Hey, Kwangryul.

04:04.994 --> 04:08.164
Your dream is a barbecue restaurant, right?

04:08.248 --> 04:09.249
I'm sorry for that.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.793
If I die today,
I won't be able to help.

04:12.710 --> 04:13.711
Jaehoon.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.713
Congratulations on
your sister's wedding.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.382
My gift was too simple.

04:18.424 --> 04:20.677
Kyuhyung, you said
your father has diabetes.

04:21.177 --> 04:23.680
I bought medicine for him.
Take her with you.

04:31.354 --> 04:32.355
Shoot.

04:34.774 --> 04:35.775
Shoot!

04:36.567 --> 04:38.528
That's
what Jung Gicheul would do.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.534
Listen, asshole.
Clean or dirty,

04:45.618 --> 04:47.161
Rags remain rags.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.956
You fucking son of a bitch.

04:50.707 --> 04:54.252
Kill me. I'm going
to die anyway, why not by you.

05:00.341 --> 05:01.342
Gicheul.

05:02.677 --> 05:04.178
It's enough.

05:05.430 --> 05:06.431
Everything is over.

05:14.897 --> 05:16.441
If it wasn't for me,

05:18.776 --> 05:20.403
you would never have made it this far.

05:23.781 --> 05:25.283
If it wasn't for me,

05:30.705 --> 05:32.957
you couldn't live like that.

05:33.499 --> 05:35.168
You didn't achieve this alone.

05:36.294 --> 05:38.421
We all risked our lives for this.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.089
You smug bastard!

05:42.842 --> 05:44.552
We are all friends.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.430
Let's end it here.

06:12.288 --> 06:14.040
A nice catch here!

06:19.337 --> 06:20.338
Guys, I'm here,

06:21.047 --> 06:24.008
because I have a very incriminating
complaint about someone

06:24.092 --> 06:25.968
for aiding
and abetting murder.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.762
Who made the ad?

06:28.262 --> 06:29.347
Are you here?

06:31.891 --> 06:33.726
Well, I see

06:33.810 --> 06:36.104
You have
quite a heated confrontation here.

06:39.649 --> 06:41.109
So this is how it ends.

06:42.151 --> 06:44.987
What a disastrous ending to the novel.

06:45.696 --> 06:46.739
Gicheul.

06:47.615 --> 06:50.201
Oh, illegal possession
of a firearm too?

06:51.494 --> 06:53.704
This story pulls out all the stops.

06:53.788 --> 06:54.997
Completely.

06:57.583 --> 06:58.626
What you up to?

06:59.210 --> 07:02.922
Are you now playing spy
under the eyes of the police?

07:04.424 --> 07:06.884
This is a massive deal,

07:07.760 --> 07:10.555
so we were very careful.

07:19.021 --> 07:22.108
That's 30kg of meth.

07:26.863 --> 07:27.780
Hey.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.366
What is this supposed to be about?

07:30.950 --> 07:33.369
I have a friend
in the Jaegeon group.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.914
I asked him
what kind of person you are.

07:36.998 --> 07:37.999
And?

07:38.666 --> 07:43.087
I was told it was safe
to contact you.

07:43.171 --> 07:44.672
And I did.

07:45.590 --> 07:48.217
And?

07:49.719 --> 07:51.095
What do you want to tell me?

07:52.597 --> 07:54.474
Take care
of Jung Gicheul for us.

07:58.936 --> 07:59.937
How?

08:00.021 --> 08:04.108
Let him
rot in prison for the rest of his life.

08:05.359 --> 08:07.737
Hey, come here.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.670
Closer, you bastards.

08:25.421 --> 08:27.507
We can provide you with the evidence.

08:28.049 --> 08:31.385
They imprison a criminal
to help this chaotic world.

08:32.261 --> 08:35.640
From now on you will be
provided with ample compensation.

08:36.474 --> 08:37.725
Just one.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.435
How? Something else?

08:41.521 --> 08:43.648
The Jaegeon group
is a shambles,

08:44.315 --> 08:46.275
cover us for it.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.277
Mann.

08:49.403 --> 08:52.365
This is crazy.

08:52.448 --> 08:53.699
Sir.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.826
I want
to lay out a larger plan.

08:59.413 --> 09:00.957
I do not believe it.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.458
How large?

09:04.502 --> 09:05.586
My goodness.

09:05.670 --> 09:09.257
We should give you at least a house
the size of Gangnam Police.

09:25.439 --> 09:26.899
That's life.

09:27.942 --> 09:30.570
In the end you are alone.

10:39.764 --> 10:40.848
This is Yu Euijeong.

10:42.391 --> 10:44.352
I'm just following Hwang Mingoo's car.

10:45.269 --> 10:49.440
OPERATING ROOM

10:49.523 --> 10:52.109
Captain Seok will pull through.

10:52.693 --> 10:53.819
Do not worry.

10:54.445 --> 10:56.280
Inspector Yu just called me.

10:56.822 --> 11:00.576
Hwang Mingoo has arrested Jung Gicheul
and is taking him to the station.

11:01.619 --> 11:04.372
Hwang Mingoo? Why he?

11:05.164 --> 11:07.917
Apparently the members
of the Gangnam Union have revolted.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.211
Why the hell are you telling me...

11:11.212 --> 11:13.506
Why are you telling me this now?

11:13.589 --> 11:17.885
You know his arrest
is the end of our investigation, right?

11:43.577 --> 11:45.037
-Hey, Detective Ko.
-Ja, Sir?

11:45.121 --> 11:46.622
How much do you get for that?

11:49.291 --> 11:51.085
10 million won?

11:51.168 --> 11:54.088
You can't earn that much
in life.

11:54.171 --> 11:55.339
10 million. My dear.

11:55.423 --> 11:56.757
Right, Mr. Jung?

11:58.718 --> 12:00.928
I said
I would lock you up.

12:04.432 --> 12:07.476
At least it's not for adultery,

12:07.560 --> 12:08.978
so not quite as embarrassing.

12:13.149 --> 12:15.901
That's why you should have listened to me.

14:06.971 --> 14:07.972
How did it go?

14:23.904 --> 14:25.114
How is Dohyung?

14:26.323 --> 14:29.034
He's recovering,
don't worry too much.

14:30.452 --> 14:31.745
How is Jung Gicheul?

14:33.706 --> 14:35.165
I was able to free him.

14:36.250 --> 14:37.459
I think he's ok.

14:37.543 --> 14:40.296
We found traces of meth
in Hwang Mingoo's car.

14:41.255 --> 14:44.800
Apparently Choi Jungbae
and Hwang Mingoo have made a pact.

14:49.805 --> 14:50.806
How do you feel?

14:51.473 --> 14:52.474
What happened?

14:57.187 --> 15:01.066
Choi Jungbae and Hwang Mingoo.
The bastards got together.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.152
All our boys

15:03.944 --> 15:04.945
turned against me.

15:07.990 --> 15:11.327
But does Choi Jungbae know

15:12.620 --> 15:15.122
who is our business partner in Japan?

15:16.248 --> 15:17.249
Only I know that.

15:18.959 --> 15:21.086
We have to get our material back first .

15:21.962 --> 15:23.839
How? The police support him.

15:23.923 --> 15:24.924
Do you have any idea?

15:27.176 --> 15:28.552
Our main focus now is,

15:29.094 --> 15:31.555
to put pressure on the Gangnam Union.

15:32.348 --> 15:36.936
Let's make sure Captain Seok's death
wasn't in vain.

15:38.354 --> 15:39.939
To catch these guys

15:40.022 --> 15:42.107
will that create enough pressure?

15:42.191 --> 15:44.902
We don't want to eliminate the Gangnam Union
.

15:45.778 --> 15:49.657
We want to narrow down your potential partners
to just one.

15:52.534 --> 15:54.370
Air Meth Jordan.
It's been a while.

15:54.453 --> 15:55.579
mr. Lee Hokwang.

15:55.663 --> 15:58.540
You are under arrest
for violating the BTM Act.

15:58.624 --> 15:59.750
Damned!

16:01.502 --> 16:02.503
You bastard!

16:04.505 --> 16:06.548
-Damned.
-Come with me.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.267
Hello Sir!

16:19.019 --> 16:21.105
-What's up?
-Jungbae.

16:22.314 --> 16:23.482
We're finished.

16:23.565 --> 16:25.192
What are you talking about?

16:25.275 --> 16:27.236
Those who should buy our material

16:27.319 --> 16:28.821
suddenly everyone disappeared.

16:28.904 --> 16:30.364
What the hell are you saying?

16:30.447 --> 16:32.616
All our customers are dried out.

16:33.742 --> 16:34.743
Damned ...

16:34.827 --> 16:38.288
All dealers relevant to Choi Jungbae
have been taken out of circulation.

16:38.372 --> 16:41.375
Now they should go
with their remaining partner

16:42.167 --> 16:44.378
successfully conclude a deal.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.381
Japan and China
are ready for their arrest.

16:48.257 --> 16:50.968
Everything is in your hands now,
Detective Park.

16:51.885 --> 16:52.970
Besides that, ...

16:55.389 --> 16:56.807
...how is Dohyung now?

17:00.811 --> 17:02.271
He is in a normal ward.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.314
He is recovering.

17:11.071 --> 17:12.072
Where do you want to go?

17:12.156 --> 17:13.323
Get our stuff.

17:14.199 --> 17:16.952
You shouldn't do that.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.663
They're looking for you.
It is dangerous.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.290
You and me,

17:22.207 --> 17:23.792
we risked everything.

17:24.543 --> 17:26.670
We can't
waste our time here.

17:26.754 --> 17:27.838
Boss.

17:28.547 --> 17:30.549
It is as you say.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.428
I risked everything too.

18:07.419 --> 18:08.420
Boss.

18:10.714 --> 18:12.591
Remember
how you said

18:15.344 --> 18:18.931
Should I stop
if it gets too hard?

18:24.812 --> 18:26.855
Why didn't you stop?

18:31.819 --> 18:33.403
I wanted a normal life.

18:36.657 --> 18:38.200
Let's be honest.

18:39.576 --> 18:42.830
For shits like us
to live a normal life...

18:46.291 --> 18:47.960
Aren't you expecting too much?

18:51.255 --> 18:52.923
"Could I turn back time,

18:55.050 --> 18:57.136
"I would have the most normal life in the world."

19:01.140 --> 19:02.724
Have you never had that thought?

19:07.479 --> 19:08.480
I don't know.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.283
Become normal...

19:25.873 --> 19:27.749
I went too far for that.

19:49.354 --> 19:51.732
That's all?
What about his lackey?

19:52.274 --> 19:56.195
I said I wanted a manhunt
for all three, including the blind man.

19:56.278 --> 19:58.155
I found out,

19:58.238 --> 19:59.865
that bastard Seo Jongryeol

19:59.948 --> 20:02.993
is being questioned in protective custody at the SMPA .

20:03.076 --> 20:04.953
Suddenly he's in protective custody?

20:05.037 --> 20:08.415
Damn, the bastard
can't even get arrested right now.

20:08.498 --> 20:10.667
What about the other lackey,
Kwon Seungho?

20:11.210 --> 20:15.130
I wanted to put the bastard
on the wanted list,

20:15.214 --> 20:16.256
but it didn't work.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.508
Damned. Why not?

20:18.592 --> 20:22.095
I entered his name
on the police intranet, but to no avail.

20:22.179 --> 20:23.513
Maybe it was deleted.

20:23.597 --> 20:24.640
That does not make sense.

20:24.723 --> 20:27.226
He's not exactly dead.
Why doesn't this work?

20:30.312 --> 20:31.480
Moment.

20:32.147 --> 20:33.398
Stop the manhunt.

20:35.359 --> 20:36.360
Stop the search?

20:45.327 --> 20:46.328
Who are you?

20:48.580 --> 20:50.165
What's the point of staring?

20:50.249 --> 20:51.625
Hey, wait a minute.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.586
You're probably the Chinese boss.

20:56.463 --> 20:58.298
You have accepted our material,

20:58.632 --> 21:00.300
so you have to pay him.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.345
Ask Jung Gicheul
about the money.

21:04.554 --> 21:07.808
You made the deal with him,
not me.

21:08.350 --> 21:09.434
Is that so?

21:10.227 --> 21:12.229
According to your logic

21:12.312 --> 21:14.606
So can I get our product back like this?

21:15.482 --> 21:18.110
like you got it from him.

21:23.615 --> 21:25.951
You motherfucker, do you want to die?

21:26.034 --> 21:27.869
Stop. That's just how he expresses himself.

21:28.578 --> 21:29.621
Stop.

21:29.705 --> 21:31.039
It's ok.

21:45.178 --> 21:47.723
Let me meet with Lee Haeryun.

21:49.391 --> 21:51.935
I have something to say to her.

21:52.019 --> 21:53.854
You can tell me.

21:53.937 --> 21:55.314
Nun ...

21:55.397 --> 21:59.484
The fact that the material flows into the market
also benefits you, right?

22:00.152 --> 22:03.363
We eliminated Jung Gicheul
and the Jargon group.

22:03.447 --> 22:07.409
And we have a big bull
to cover us.

22:08.869 --> 22:11.246
So why don't you work with us?

22:13.415 --> 22:15.667
We want
you to connect us with Japan.

22:16.710 --> 22:18.420
Only then can we
do business.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.681
Did you really have to go that far, sir?

22:30.349 --> 22:33.685
At least he'll be
buried in the national cemetery.

22:38.982 --> 22:42.527
Nothing good happens without sacrifice.

22:43.612 --> 22:47.282
Please don't tell
Detective Park about this.

22:48.116 --> 22:49.868
He's having a hard time anyway.

22:50.369 --> 22:53.372
You
don't want to make it any harder for him, do you?

23:32.077 --> 23:33.078
Hey, Euijeong.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.497
Hi, Gicheul.

23:43.547 --> 23:44.965
Why didn't you ever answer?

23:45.882 --> 23:47.175
I was worried.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.552
I'm sorry.

23:49.511 --> 23:50.637
Something came up.

23:51.388 --> 23:52.431
Are you OK?

23:52.514 --> 23:53.640
Naturally.

23:53.723 --> 23:58.311
Is Seungho with you?

23:59.938 --> 24:01.731
Are you both safe?

24:02.357 --> 24:03.358
And.

24:05.735 --> 24:06.903
When I'm done with this,

24:07.988 --> 24:10.657
I'll come back to you.
Just wait a little longer.

24:14.202 --> 24:15.370
Next time I'll call.

24:24.129 --> 24:25.630
Dieser Bastard Kwon Seungho.

24:25.714 --> 24:27.215
What about him?

24:27.299 --> 24:29.050
We can't check him.

24:29.134 --> 24:30.844
How did he even get to you?

24:31.344 --> 24:34.347
Jung Gicheul's girlfriend,
the fucking policewoman.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.434
It says he has known her since she was little.

24:37.517 --> 24:40.770
You monkeys!
Why are you telling me this now?

24:41.771 --> 24:42.772
At I...

24:42.856 --> 24:44.107
Sir.

24:45.108 --> 24:47.110
I think I know how we do

24:47.194 --> 24:49.529
Kwon Seungho
and Jung Gicheul can catch.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.909
Yu Euijeong und Lee Haeryun.

24:55.035 --> 24:56.828
Your people are supposed to pursue both.

25:04.377 --> 25:09.925
Jung Gicheul and Kwon Seungho
will definitely follow them.

25:10.008 --> 25:10.926
Why?

25:11.593 --> 25:13.512
Kwon Seungho and Lee Haeryun.

25:13.595 --> 25:15.305
Jung Gicheul and Yu Euijeong.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.016
So they formed as couples.

25:18.099 --> 25:20.435
They are simply dangerous.
What they have to get.

25:31.821 --> 25:33.865
You guys can
be really smart sometimes.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.879
Seriously? Coffee at this time?

25:48.755 --> 25:49.756
My goodness.

25:51.716 --> 25:54.052
Hello. I'm really looking forward
to meeting you.

25:57.639 --> 25:59.933
We've heard a lot about you.

26:00.016 --> 26:03.019
They are even more beautiful
than I expected.

26:09.484 --> 26:10.902
You are funny.

26:10.986 --> 26:13.405
Yes, I'm pretty funny.

26:15.448 --> 26:16.449
Where is the material?

26:17.367 --> 26:18.702
First

26:18.785 --> 26:21.454
we would like to introduce ourselves.

26:22.539 --> 26:23.540
Please.

26:42.142 --> 26:43.518
They are very suspicious.

26:44.436 --> 26:47.689
Anyone who has betrayed their boss
shouldn't be surprised.

26:48.773 --> 26:50.900
Deceived?

26:50.984 --> 26:52.485
What do you mean by that?

26:53.403 --> 26:56.031
The weak are weeded out.

26:56.114 --> 26:57.782
That's how it is in our business.

26:57.866 --> 27:00.535
The strong like us
should join forces.

27:01.411 --> 27:02.829
They're planning pretty big.

27:03.622 --> 27:06.750
We are indeed planning big.

27:07.250 --> 27:11.379
It was even my suggestion
that we take 30kg.

27:14.132 --> 27:16.968
We must act quickly
and compensate the Japanese.

27:17.052 --> 27:18.136
And the place.

27:19.179 --> 27:20.472
You know where, yes?

27:20.555 --> 27:21.556
And.

27:22.474 --> 27:23.767
I roughly know the area

27:23.850 --> 27:27.145
But I drank a lot yesterday,
so I'm not sure right now.

27:27.228 --> 27:28.229
Where else was it?

27:57.133 --> 27:58.301
Go there,

27:59.386 --> 28:01.596
and deliver the material on time.

28:03.932 --> 28:07.477
And send us the money immediately
if you have it from Japan.

28:14.651 --> 28:15.819
Oh yes, there.

28:16.611 --> 28:17.612
Ok.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.280
There will be no setbacks,

28:20.323 --> 28:22.033
as was the case with Mr. Jung?

28:22.951 --> 28:26.246
There were always problems
when the guy was there, right?

28:26.329 --> 28:28.790
It was me who constantly
had to clean up his mess.

28:32.168 --> 28:33.169
Let's get this done.

28:34.921 --> 28:36.047
Let's do this.

28:38.550 --> 28:39.551
Miss.

28:39.634 --> 28:41.344
You don't know her very well.

28:41.845 --> 28:42.846
Why were you

28:43.638 --> 28:45.014
so amicably?

28:57.152 --> 28:58.153
Hallo?

29:00.488 --> 29:02.073
Seungho, I did it like this.

29:04.617 --> 29:06.244
The deal is in Pohang tomorrow.

29:06.911 --> 29:08.288
Thank you very much, Haeryun.

29:09.330 --> 29:11.875
But we don't know
what Choi Jungbae is planning,

29:12.876 --> 29:13.877
so be careful.

29:14.711 --> 29:15.712
Ok.

29:23.511 --> 29:25.221
They know
you are close to her.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.348
Do you think they trust her?

29:27.432 --> 29:29.809
With a huge fortune
at your fingertips,

29:29.893 --> 29:32.312
these fools can
no longer see clearly.

29:43.448 --> 29:46.534
Choi Jungbae is sending
the material to the Japanese in Pohang tomorrow.

29:46.618 --> 29:47.786
Jung Gicheul plant,

29:48.661 --> 29:51.664
To take the money
he receives from Choi Jungbae.

29:51.748 --> 29:53.666
When the ship leaves tomorrow,

29:54.250 --> 29:56.544
Oyama will receive it in two days.

29:56.628 --> 29:57.754
That will happen.

29:57.837 --> 30:01.090
I'm putting China and Japan
on standby.

30:01.841 --> 30:03.760
This time it has to work.

30:04.511 --> 30:05.553
Alongside, ...

30:08.223 --> 30:10.934
...how can I contact Dohyung?

30:11.768 --> 30:13.269
Is he really okay?

30:13.853 --> 30:15.063
No worries.

30:15.146 --> 30:17.232
His injury requires further rest.

30:18.817 --> 30:19.984
We'll soon be there.

30:20.610 --> 30:22.237
Let's focus on the deal.

30:24.113 --> 30:29.160
ATTORNEY
CHO CHANGSIK
ATTORNEY
CHO CHANGSIK

30:30.703 --> 30:32.705
TO THE LATE
SEOK DOHYUNG

30:39.128 --> 30:41.798
I'm from the Gangnam Police Department
and I have a few questions.

30:43.341 --> 30:44.342
Also ...

30:52.100 --> 30:54.727
Are you the wife of the deceased?

30:55.603 --> 30:56.604
And.

30:57.772 --> 31:00.108
What was the name of the deceased?

31:00.650 --> 31:01.860
Seok Dohyung.

31:01.943 --> 31:04.737
What is it about?

31:08.533 --> 31:10.451
Do you know Detective Park Junmo?

31:14.038 --> 31:15.415
Tomorrow they'll try again

31:15.957 --> 31:17.959
to meet the Japanese in Pohang.

31:18.459 --> 31:19.502
Go to Pohang.

31:26.217 --> 31:27.218
Should the deal

31:27.719 --> 31:29.262
fail again this time,

31:29.804 --> 31:31.848
Your father wo
n't just watch it.

31:33.641 --> 31:34.767
No worries.

31:35.351 --> 31:38.187
He calls himself my father
even though he uses me,

31:38.855 --> 31:40.607
but I trust Kwon Seungho more.

32:12.555 --> 32:13.556
Hey, what's up?

32:14.891 --> 32:15.892
Here?

32:16.851 --> 32:17.977
I'm on the 12th floor.

32:21.689 --> 32:22.732
Are you here?

32:23.816 --> 32:24.943
Sir.

32:25.026 --> 32:26.819
Why did you come
all this way?

32:27.403 --> 32:31.115
It's like you said.
We won the jackpot.

32:32.075 --> 32:33.159
What do you mean by that?

32:36.579 --> 32:37.580
What is that?

32:48.883 --> 32:50.510
Excuse me.

32:50.593 --> 32:51.594
Can we talk?

32:53.888 --> 32:55.598
I know you're in there.

33:00.144 --> 33:01.771
Let's talk about Kwon Seungho.

33:02.772 --> 33:03.773
It does not take long.

33:07.944 --> 33:10.446
We're busy people,
I'll get straight to the point.

33:11.364 --> 33:14.200
Where are Jung Gicheul
and Kwon Seungho now?

33:14.993 --> 33:16.869
I would like to know that.

33:23.126 --> 33:24.502
You know this woman, yes?

33:25.795 --> 33:27.213
Mr. Jung's girlfriend.

33:27.296 --> 33:30.466
More like a lover.

33:31.050 --> 33:32.343
She is actually married.

33:33.094 --> 33:34.470
With a Park Junmo.

33:35.763 --> 33:37.557
What a disaster her life is.

33:38.766 --> 33:40.226
She is married?

33:42.311 --> 33:43.354
He's a police officer too?

33:43.438 --> 33:44.439
But you know,

33:45.481 --> 33:47.108
what's even more amazing?

33:49.360 --> 33:52.405
This man is not that man.

33:52.488 --> 33:53.489
Do you understand?

33:54.032 --> 33:55.241
What are you talking about?

33:55.324 --> 33:59.829
Park Junmo is not Park Junmo.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.082
Here.

34:07.211 --> 34:09.839
Ta-da!

34:17.263 --> 34:19.474
The Kwon Seungho you know.

34:20.183 --> 34:23.770
Kwon Seungho. The bastard is Park Junmo.

34:24.645 --> 34:27.607
Police Chief Park Junmo
of the Eumseong Police Department.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.113
You were played something.

34:45.917 --> 34:48.461
Just tell me
where Kwon Seungho is.

34:49.253 --> 34:51.631
I'll put him in handcuffs immediately.

34:52.256 --> 34:53.633
So tell me.

34:55.635 --> 34:57.345
We are on the same page.

34:58.471 --> 35:00.681
Even if he is a police officer,

35:00.765 --> 35:04.102
what he did as an undercover cop
is enough

35:04.185 --> 35:06.270
that he will spend life in prison.

35:07.897 --> 35:08.898
Haeryun.

35:08.981 --> 35:11.317
Do you want to wait in China?

35:12.610 --> 35:13.736
Die Situation

35:15.446 --> 35:17.281
in Korea is quite unsafe.

35:18.449 --> 35:22.078
When searching for the substance,
who knows what will happen.

35:25.498 --> 35:28.417
If the deal
fails again this time,

35:29.210 --> 35:31.212
Your father won't just watch.

35:37.969 --> 35:38.970
Hallo?

35:39.762 --> 35:40.972
It's me, Haeryun.

35:41.305 --> 35:42.723
Hello, Haeryun.

35:42.807 --> 35:44.725
I was just going to call you.

35:45.810 --> 35:47.687
We're leaving now.

35:48.437 --> 35:49.730
Don't worry too much.

35:50.523 --> 35:51.566
Everything will be fine.

35:51.649 --> 35:53.317
Can I ask you something?

35:59.365 --> 36:01.534
You've been very nice to me all this time.

36:03.786 --> 36:05.121
Did you mean that honestly?

36:07.999 --> 36:09.000
Was?

36:09.458 --> 36:11.210
This is such a...

36:12.879 --> 36:14.881
Answer me.
Did you mean that honestly?

36:40.781 --> 36:43.618
And? Have you considered it?

36:44.410 --> 36:46.746
If I tell you
where Kwon Seungho is,

36:46.829 --> 36:48.456
will you keep your word?

36:48.539 --> 36:51.667
Come!
Of course I will.

36:51.751 --> 36:52.793
Can you see it,

36:53.502 --> 36:56.380
Kwon Seungho -
The Best Of Park Junmo,

36:56.464 --> 36:59.008
I'll have him in the bag
before he even notices.

36:59.091 --> 37:00.509
No worries.

37:02.011 --> 37:03.137
You know what?

37:09.060 --> 37:12.605
I'm getting tired of this business too.

37:17.526 --> 37:18.945
My father called.

37:21.656 --> 37:23.449
I should come back.

37:24.825 --> 37:25.826
What should I do?

37:27.954 --> 37:29.747
Should I go to Changchun?

37:31.874 --> 37:33.292
Or stay in Korea?

37:37.088 --> 37:38.089
Listen,

37:39.382 --> 37:40.383
Haeryun.

37:43.678 --> 37:45.137
Neither in Korea nor in China.

37:48.015 --> 37:50.184
Until it's all over,

37:53.396 --> 37:55.273
you should stay in Hong Kong.

38:27.888 --> 38:29.348
What happened?

38:29.432 --> 38:30.516
Why did you do that?

38:31.058 --> 38:32.059
Because I have someone

38:32.768 --> 38:34.353
I want to protect in my heart.

38:35.104 --> 38:36.314
This is our last chance.

38:37.815 --> 38:39.191
Will everything work out?

38:40.651 --> 38:41.777
Everything will work.

38:45.948 --> 38:46.991
Boss.

38:50.411 --> 38:51.412
Nothing.

38:56.334 --> 38:57.335
I drive.

39:21.817 --> 39:23.778
There's a police officer out there.

39:24.153 --> 39:26.322
Have you forgotten
that there are always two of them?

39:26.405 --> 39:27.907
I'll do it.

39:28.407 --> 39:29.408
You should go.

39:30.576 --> 39:31.660
I lure him away.

39:32.328 --> 39:35.164
Run before reinforcements arrive.

39:36.791 --> 39:38.876
Lee Haeryun, pull yourself together.

39:39.710 --> 39:40.711
Listen to me.

39:40.795 --> 39:42.088
Don't go to China.

39:42.588 --> 39:44.715
If they find out
you blew it,

39:45.800 --> 39:48.302
you are no longer sure.

39:49.887 --> 39:50.930
Why?

39:53.140 --> 39:54.767
So are we.

39:57.812 --> 40:00.981
You have to survive, no matter what.

40:02.441 --> 40:03.442
And then

40:04.151 --> 40:05.403
go to the man,

40:08.114 --> 40:09.281
that you trust.

40:45.901 --> 40:46.944
You bastard.

40:54.535 --> 40:55.619
Damn bastard.

42:02.311 --> 42:03.437
Let's go.

42:09.818 --> 42:10.819
Hallo.

42:14.823 --> 42:15.908
Here is the material.

42:51.610 --> 42:53.070
Fuck.

43:03.706 --> 43:05.082
The product has been handed over.

43:05.165 --> 43:06.625
Boat name is Blue Dragon.

43:06.709 --> 43:07.918
Repeat: Blue Dragon.

43:08.877 --> 43:12.840
This is Korea. The freighter
Blue Dragon has left Pohang.

43:13.716 --> 43:15.676
Yes, the captain is the courier.

43:16.135 --> 43:17.011
Ok.

43:18.512 --> 43:19.513
Let's go.

43:20.139 --> 43:21.181
Boss.

43:23.142 --> 43:24.143
Was?

43:24.226 --> 43:26.520
I think you should stay here.

43:26.812 --> 43:28.022
What are you talking about?

43:28.689 --> 43:30.482
I'll take care of myself

43:31.817 --> 43:32.818
about the guys.

43:32.901 --> 43:35.321
You can't do this alone, you crazy.

43:37.448 --> 43:38.449
I know.

43:38.949 --> 43:39.950
Young Gicheul.

43:43.120 --> 43:44.163
Let's stop here.

43:44.747 --> 43:45.914
What are you doing?

43:49.877 --> 43:50.878
Kwon Seungho.

43:50.961 --> 43:52.880
It's all over, you bastard.

43:56.967 --> 43:58.510
What the hell are you doing?

44:01.889 --> 44:03.015
Listen, Jung Gicheul.

44:05.684 --> 44:07.394
You wanted a normal life,

44:09.772 --> 44:11.231
but you didn't have a chance?

44:13.025 --> 44:14.026
No.

44:15.944 --> 44:16.945
That is not true.

44:19.281 --> 44:20.407
That's just an excuse.

44:22.826 --> 44:23.827
I hope,

44:26.789 --> 44:28.916
that in the end you
will pay for everything,

44:30.334 --> 44:31.627
what you have done.

44:36.548 --> 44:37.591
Kwon Seungho.

44:38.384 --> 44:40.094
Let's end it here.

44:59.071 --> 45:00.239
Hey, Choi Jungbae.

45:10.040 --> 45:12.918
Why are you alone?
Where is Jung Gicheul?

45:13.961 --> 45:15.963
You're not even bringing people with you anymore?

45:16.547 --> 45:18.716
Let's end this all here, okay?

45:19.758 --> 45:21.009
Everything is over.

45:23.679 --> 45:25.389
He's really alone here.

45:28.142 --> 45:30.185
What the hell is this damn monkey saying
?

45:30.269 --> 45:32.438
Is this a bluff?

45:33.522 --> 45:35.607
You motherfucker. Come here.

45:38.402 --> 45:39.570
Damned.

45:41.155 --> 45:43.365
What do you want to do alone?

45:43.449 --> 45:44.450
I mean, shit,

45:44.533 --> 45:47.828
Do you want
to fight against the three of us all alone?

45:51.498 --> 45:52.499
What the hell ...?

45:54.918 --> 45:56.295
Let's disappear.

45:59.465 --> 46:00.549
Let's get out of there!

46:00.966 --> 46:02.259
You were a cop?

46:02.885 --> 46:06.597
You fucking motherfucker.
You had to be a cop!

46:07.931 --> 46:09.224
Damned!

46:10.601 --> 46:11.852
Drop the knife!

46:12.311 --> 46:13.312
Drop!

46:13.395 --> 46:14.897
Drop the knife!

46:20.903 --> 46:22.154
Arrest her.

46:22.237 --> 46:23.238
On the ground!

46:24.698 --> 46:25.616
Crap.

46:27.409 --> 46:28.410
Put on the ground!

46:29.036 --> 46:30.537
Okay, you asshole!

46:31.079 --> 46:32.915
Kwon Seungho, you bastard!

46:40.798 --> 46:42.090
Asshole!

46:43.842 --> 46:45.260
Fuck!

46:45.344 --> 46:47.387
Kwon Seungho, du Hurensohn!

46:48.931 --> 46:50.307
Ok, enough now.

46:50.766 --> 46:53.101
Kwon Seungho, du Mistkerl!

46:58.565 --> 46:59.942
Ok!

47:03.320 --> 47:05.447
Anyone who doesn't want to listen
gets slapped.

47:05.781 --> 47:06.615
Invite them.

47:06.698 --> 47:07.741
Out of the way, please!

47:20.295 --> 47:25.133
YOKOHAMA, JAPAN

47:54.204 --> 47:57.374
We have news from Korea.
The operation can begin.

47:57.457 --> 48:00.586
Captain, Donghobang's boss
Lee Oson is inside.

48:00.669 --> 48:02.546
They could offer fierce resistance.

48:04.923 --> 48:06.758
When the law fears the underworld,

48:07.593 --> 48:08.760
become our children

48:10.220 --> 48:12.055
have to live in barbaric times.

48:22.816 --> 48:25.527
We quickly relocate their hiding place.

48:25.611 --> 48:30.365
Remember, this operation
is intended to completely destroy Donghobang.

48:40.417 --> 48:42.586
Drop your weapons and surrender!

48:43.754 --> 48:44.796
Anyone who resists

48:44.880 --> 48:46.256
will be killed!

48:47.174 --> 48:48.592
Father, please save me.

48:54.306 --> 48:55.515
Yoon Wongil?

49:08.070 --> 49:09.196
Good job.

49:09.613 --> 49:10.781
Thanks sir.

49:10.864 --> 49:12.991
Now you have something to say to the gang.

49:15.619 --> 49:16.620
Oyama!

49:18.497 --> 49:20.958
You should be a drug dealer,
not a murderer.

49:21.667 --> 49:23.794
Call your family.
say,

49:24.461 --> 49:26.630
They'll never come home again.

49:36.348 --> 49:39.643
The authorities in Korea, Japan and China

49:40.018 --> 49:41.520
have been successful together

49:41.603 --> 49:45.565
an international drug investigation
was carried out.

49:45.899 --> 49:48.902
The bosses of the Seoul-
based Gangnam Union,

49:48.986 --> 49:50.612
Choi Jungbae and Hong Heesung,

49:50.696 --> 49:52.614
sent meth maker

49:53.490 --> 49:59.246
also known as Professor Yoon,
to Changchun in Jilin, China.

49:59.329 --> 50:02.833
With the support
of the local gang Donghobang

50:02.916 --> 50:05.585
They set up a drug factory.

50:05.836 --> 50:09.214
They turned to Yoshioka-gumi,
a Yakuza gang

50:09.297 --> 50:11.341
in Yokohama, Japan,
and their underboss,

50:11.425 --> 50:13.969
den Korea-Japaner
namens Oyama Tsuyoshi,

50:14.052 --> 50:16.221

50:16.304 --> 50:19.307
They agreed to a meth deal
at 10 million yen per kilogram,

50:19.391 --> 50:21.935
equivalent to
80 million Korean won...

50:42.706 --> 50:46.293
PLAN FOR INTERNATIONAL FREE CITY FAILS
FOLLOWING FINANCING

50:53.008 --> 50:54.926
STOP AT THE RAILWAY CROSSING!

51:12.527 --> 51:14.613
SEOK DOHYUNG

51:22.621 --> 51:23.705
Dohyung

51:25.165 --> 51:26.958
would be very proud of you.

51:32.798 --> 51:33.799
So much has happened

51:36.093 --> 51:37.844
during the investigation.

52:07.624 --> 52:08.625
Do you think we can?

52:11.169 --> 52:12.754
be who we were again?

52:37.904 --> 52:39.072
Euijeong.

53:07.976 --> 53:10.979
You two look good together.

53:21.573 --> 53:22.616
Put the gun down.

53:25.243 --> 53:26.244
Drop them.

53:26.786 --> 53:27.787
Gicheul.

53:28.788 --> 53:30.624
Don't make any
more wrong decisions.

53:31.249 --> 53:32.334
Wrong decisions?

53:36.379 --> 53:38.048
To protect you two,

53:40.217 --> 53:42.135
I gave up on everyone
who stuck by me.

53:48.600 --> 53:50.435
That was a wrong decision.

53:51.811 --> 53:52.938
Young Gicheul.

53:56.399 --> 53:57.400
That is not true.

54:00.528 --> 54:03.406
All your decisions
were simply wrong.

54:04.241 --> 54:05.367
So drop them.

54:07.285 --> 54:08.620
Drop the weapon immediately!

54:11.706 --> 54:13.083
Answer me a question.

54:15.961 --> 54:17.128
Why was I spared?

54:19.214 --> 54:20.215
Why?

54:24.261 --> 54:25.512
And you, Euijeong?

54:28.139 --> 54:30.016
Have you ever been honest with me?

54:32.560 --> 54:34.062
Do you just have me?

54:36.439 --> 54:37.816
used for the investigation?

54:39.484 --> 54:41.152
Whether I was honest or not,

54:42.237 --> 54:43.947
doesn't change anything.

54:48.660 --> 54:49.661
Gicheul.

54:51.079 --> 54:52.872
I believed the best thing would be

54:54.249 --> 54:57.252
to stop you from further crimes.

55:10.140 --> 55:11.558
I may be a wicked man,

55:12.600 --> 55:15.270
but you have betrayed my trust
and deceived me.

55:16.688 --> 55:18.064
Isn't that a crime?

55:19.566 --> 55:20.567
That's it.

55:22.193 --> 55:24.237
And we will certainly
have to pay for it.

55:25.613 --> 55:27.073
If not in lifetime,

55:29.617 --> 55:30.618
then after death.

55:45.008 --> 55:46.968
You will pay
in your lifetime.

55:48.261 --> 55:49.554
The rest of your life

55:50.972 --> 55:52.807
you won't be happy anymore.

56:01.483 --> 56:02.484
Gicheul!

56:09.949 --> 56:11.868
Gicheul.

56:26.633 --> 56:27.634
No.

56:42.774 --> 56:44.818
Wake up, Gicheul.

56:54.119 --> 56:56.413

56:57.539 --> 56:58.540

57:38.621 --> 57:39.789

57:42.000 --> 57:43.084
