00:01.835 --> 00:08.425
THE CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS AND
EVENTS OF THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

00:12.637 --> 00:13.680
Bloody hell!

00:23.023 --> 00:24.065
Kill her!

00:24.149 --> 00:25.150
Kill her!

00:25.233 --> 00:26.234
What are you doing?

00:26.317 --> 00:27.569
Go ahead, kill him!

00:41.791 --> 00:43.084
Damned!

00:48.757 --> 00:50.717
Find out what Jung Gicheul is up to

00:51.176 --> 00:52.761
and where he goes with whom.

00:53.011 --> 00:55.722
Keep us informed about it.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.142
Dirt pigs!

01:13.198 --> 01:14.407
Damn son of a bitch!

01:18.745 --> 01:20.413
You motherfuckers!

01:26.002 --> 01:27.003
Fuck!

01:34.094 --> 01:36.012
Hyeok is in the emergency room.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.972
I can't go fishing tomorrow.

01:38.056 --> 01:39.432
You two go alone.

01:39.516 --> 01:40.600
Hi, Boss.

01:40.683 --> 01:42.977
I have a flat tire
and am stuck.

01:43.061 --> 01:44.145
Excuse me.

01:44.479 --> 01:45.980
Can you move on already?

01:49.150 --> 01:50.568
What are you fucking doing?

01:54.197 --> 01:55.198
Young Gicheul.

01:55.865 --> 01:57.700
You Hurensohn!

01:57.784 --> 01:58.910
Fuck!

02:09.921 --> 02:13.258
Do I look like
a sneaky traitor, you son of a bitch?

02:21.307 --> 02:22.142
Seung Ho.

02:28.773 --> 02:29.649
Get in quickly.

02:29.732 --> 02:30.817
You shit!

02:45.707 --> 02:47.792
Damned!

02:48.459 --> 02:49.586
Seung Ho.

02:49.669 --> 02:50.545
Kwon Seungho!

02:51.629 --> 02:53.089
Come on. Wake up.

02:55.758 --> 02:56.885
Seungho, stay with me.

02:59.470 --> 03:00.805
Go ahead!

03:08.688 --> 03:15.361
THE WORST OF EVIL

03:17.947 --> 03:21.743
OPERATION

03:23.786 --> 03:26.497
-We need a lot of bandages.
-Yes, doctor.

03:26.581 --> 03:27.832
-It's bleeding a lot.
-Yes.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.542
-Do not touch the wound.
-OK.

03:29.626 --> 03:30.627
-Mortgage.
- Ok.

03:30.710 --> 03:37.675
OPERATION

04:08.331 --> 04:10.458
Something happened on the way to the port.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.293
I am fully responsible.

04:25.056 --> 04:27.308
Was that China, boss?

04:27.392 --> 04:30.520
The Japanese should also be called.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.564
Wait outside.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.278
Yes, boss.

04:47.996 --> 04:48.997
Chief Seo.

04:49.789 --> 04:50.790
Yes, Boss.

04:54.585 --> 04:56.462
You know who knew besides the three of us

04:57.630 --> 04:59.340
that I went fishing, right?

05:00.758 --> 05:02.385
Yes, Sir.

05:02.468 --> 05:04.345
Heesung, Jungbae, Kyungjin, Byungwoo.

05:06.347 --> 05:09.058
Find out who
is in cahoots with Jaegeon.

05:10.226 --> 05:12.353
You're the only one
I can trust.

05:14.063 --> 05:15.064
Yes, boss.

05:27.910 --> 05:29.078
Hallo.

05:30.413 --> 05:33.750
Were you recently
called by a Mercedes with a flat tire?

05:34.876 --> 05:36.085
Ah, that one.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.463
I'm there,

05:38.546 --> 05:41.257
and the guy was totally
unfriendly and just pushed.

05:43.593 --> 05:44.886
There he is.

05:45.386 --> 05:47.013
Must have driven very aggressively.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.349
An unusual crack.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.529
Is Seungho okay?

06:04.447 --> 06:06.074
Is Gicheul still in the hospital?

06:08.326 --> 06:09.494
And.

06:09.577 --> 06:12.121
These pigs will pay for it.

06:15.625 --> 06:16.709
Thanks.

06:19.545 --> 06:22.340
I was
in the office the whole time that day.

06:22.423 --> 06:24.133
I watched a video with him,

06:24.300 --> 06:26.761
and that night
we had a drink in his bar.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.097
Before that we played pool.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.766
Exactly. We also went
to a pool hall.

06:48.116 --> 06:49.742
Dont move. Hold still.

06:49.826 --> 06:50.827
I'll get help.

06:53.538 --> 06:57.375
Captain Seok talks to the doctors.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.128
-Worry...
-You are irresponsible.

07:00.211 --> 07:03.381
They knew about the turf war
with Song Donghyuk's gang.

07:03.464 --> 07:08.428
Did he really have to be alone there?

07:09.887 --> 07:11.973
Couldn't you take any precautions?

07:12.056 --> 07:14.183
Have local support available?

07:15.059 --> 07:17.437
We cannot
predict every scenario.

07:18.312 --> 07:21.190
It is normal
for unexpected situations to arise.

07:23.568 --> 07:26.988
And you want to go through with it
after everything that's happened.

07:30.241 --> 07:32.702
Did it help Junmo in any way...

07:32.827 --> 07:36.330
... that I met Jung Gicheul?

07:37.373 --> 07:39.834
If so, I want to help more actively.

07:41.085 --> 07:44.213
If I
can get my husband out of there unharmed,

07:45.047 --> 07:47.216
I meet Jung Gicheul and play along.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.969
Anything to
end this crazy operation quickly!

07:57.643 --> 08:00.980
That was the second time
you saved my life.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.568
I trust you now.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.408
Boss.

08:13.784 --> 08:14.785
If so,

08:17.413 --> 08:18.998
can I have a cigarette?

08:27.924 --> 08:29.133
No product for us?

08:29.550 --> 08:32.220
We didn't even meet
the Korean captain.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.680
No news from them?

08:34.931 --> 08:37.266
No. His phone is turned off.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.978
The payment was in advance, right?

08:41.062 --> 08:42.063
Yes, Boss.

08:45.816 --> 08:47.151
Tried to reach her.

08:47.443 --> 08:48.444
Yes, boss.

08:50.154 --> 08:51.572
Because of the fishing trip...

08:52.949 --> 08:54.325
Are you really going fishing?

08:56.160 --> 08:57.537
Middle of the night?

08:58.037 --> 08:59.914
At least the sailing part, yes.

09:01.666 --> 09:02.667
For what?

09:07.755 --> 09:10.424
After all that
, I have a right to know.

09:11.342 --> 09:13.553
Is it some kind of smuggling at sea?

09:14.011 --> 09:15.263
Everything in its time.

09:24.814 --> 09:25.815
Found out what?

09:26.107 --> 09:27.275
Not yet, sir.

09:28.067 --> 09:29.527
I think I know who it is.

09:30.278 --> 09:31.279
Who is it, sir?

09:32.863 --> 09:34.490
Send everyone back to Seoul.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.411
They are supposed to gather at the office at 9:00 p.m.

09:39.078 --> 09:40.121
Every single one.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.123
Yes, boss.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.377
And first tell them

09:48.212 --> 09:50.673
we would know who
sold our gang to Jaegeon.

09:52.091 --> 09:55.011
And that I
will punish the rat in front of everyone.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.264
Yes, boss.

10:18.409 --> 10:20.828
Bon Voyage. See you there.

10:23.205 --> 10:27.460
JEIL HOSPITAL

10:29.045 --> 10:31.047
Moment. I have a question.

10:31.756 --> 10:35.676
How are the guys
who got shot doing?

10:37.845 --> 10:40.931
They're all alive,
don't worry.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.059
Instead, worry about yourself.

10:52.943 --> 10:53.944
Give me the key.

11:00.326 --> 11:01.369
Boss.

11:20.054 --> 11:22.181
INTERNATIONAL, JAPAN

11:26.977 --> 11:29.230
-Hello.
-You son of a bitch.

11:29.313 --> 11:31.565
You dare
to ignore our call?

11:31.732 --> 11:34.652
Do you think
we can't find you with our money?

11:34.777 --> 11:35.820
Do you think that?

11:49.417 --> 11:50.626
It's me.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.045
What happened?

11:53.129 --> 11:54.213
On the way to the sea

11:54.422 --> 11:56.340
Song Donghyuk's men attacked us.

11:58.509 --> 12:00.594
One of us almost died.

12:00.678 --> 12:01.637
An ambush?

12:02.012 --> 12:04.265
That means they knew

12:04.473 --> 12:07.268
which route you would take.

12:12.940 --> 12:16.902
I also just noticed
that I was being watched.

12:17.153 --> 12:20.448
There must be a rat

12:20.531 --> 12:23.284
under your command.

12:23.951 --> 12:25.369
Do you have anything to say about that?

12:25.453 --> 12:26.328
No.

12:26.620 --> 12:30.958
Either way, you are
responsible for what happened.

12:40.801 --> 12:41.635
What do we do?

12:41.719 --> 12:42.887
Start the car!

13:07.244 --> 13:09.121
So really.

13:09.205 --> 13:10.122
Hey.

13:11.415 --> 13:12.333
Is not it ...

13:12.416 --> 13:14.043
... really tight in here for you?

13:14.752 --> 13:16.921
You can make yourself comfortable.

13:17.213 --> 13:20.216
Do you want to emulate Chow Yun-fat
or what?

13:20.591 --> 13:22.593
Wherever you go, there is war.

13:23.677 --> 13:26.263
But somehow you never die doing it.

13:27.181 --> 13:28.974
Just like in A Better Tomorrow.

13:37.775 --> 13:39.819
Man, Chow Yung-fat is so cool.

13:40.027 --> 13:42.822
It would have been perfect with sticks.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.909
You probably fought like that too.

13:47.576 --> 13:49.036
Total irre.

13:55.251 --> 13:59.129
RASTHOF JINJONG

14:03.300 --> 14:05.094
I'm going to the bathroom.

14:05.177 --> 14:06.262
Ok.

14:14.645 --> 14:16.146
It seems you have to too.

14:17.773 --> 14:19.942
I'll do it very quickly.

14:20.776 --> 14:21.902
Ow, my stomach.

14:27.992 --> 14:28.993
That hurts!

14:44.508 --> 14:45.926
Junmo.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.306
Are you OK?

14:50.389 --> 14:52.641
I almost died.

14:53.392 --> 14:54.393
I'm sorry.

14:55.269 --> 14:56.186
It's ok.

14:59.440 --> 15:02.860
Gicheul actually seems
to be smuggling when he goes fishing.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.029
And tonight

15:05.112 --> 15:07.156
he wants to kill the gang's traitor.

15:07.239 --> 15:08.782
We have to prevent that.

15:09.283 --> 15:11.577
OK. Take care.

15:11.660 --> 15:12.620
I'll do it.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.399
INCOMING CALL

15:45.319 --> 15:46.320
Hallo?

15:48.572 --> 15:50.157
Incheon port in two days?

15:52.743 --> 15:54.119
Are you coming here?

15:59.541 --> 16:00.709
In order.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.605
I'll make the salutation easier for you.

16:21.689 --> 16:23.899
Seungho is the oldest here,

16:23.983 --> 16:25.943
From now on you will call him "Sir".

16:26.360 --> 16:27.361
Ok?

16:27.444 --> 16:28.570
Yes, boss.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.155
Louder, you bastards!

16:30.739 --> 16:31.865
Yes, boss!

16:49.091 --> 16:50.759
Do you know who sold us...

16:54.346 --> 16:55.639
... to the Jaegeon group?

17:02.813 --> 17:03.814
Good to meet you.

17:08.444 --> 17:11.780
If you decline, someone
else will accept our offer.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.116
Think about it carefully.

17:14.908 --> 17:16.076
Look around

17:16.785 --> 17:18.495
and look who isn't here,

17:19.329 --> 17:20.914
because they don't want to die.

17:27.379 --> 17:30.007
Kyungjin, Byungwoo und Chief Seo.

17:30.090 --> 17:31.717
I don't see the three.

17:40.934 --> 17:43.228
Sorry. I couldn't get a taxi.

17:53.572 --> 17:54.782
Who is the traitor?

17:56.575 --> 17:58.494
I think
not Heesung or Jungbae.

17:59.536 --> 18:02.581
They're all alive,
don't worry.

18:03.707 --> 18:04.750
Oh Kyungjin.

18:05.542 --> 18:08.337
We should find him
and get him away quickly.

18:09.505 --> 18:12.299
He was the only one who knew
the situation in the Jaegeon group.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.343
Oh Kyungjin.

18:21.767 --> 18:22.768
Hallo?

18:24.478 --> 18:25.729
Kyungjin?

18:27.064 --> 18:28.190
Yes, Boss.

18:35.906 --> 18:36.907
Oh Kyungjin.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.452
Oh Kyungjin!

18:52.756 --> 18:54.007
Damned.

18:56.343 --> 18:58.428
Fuck.

19:01.849 --> 19:03.517
Fuck ...

19:09.231 --> 19:12.693
Kyungjin, why did you do it?

19:13.110 --> 19:15.237
Why are you asking me this?

19:17.072 --> 19:19.032
It's shameful for me.

19:24.705 --> 19:26.331
Yeah, that's not important, is it?

19:27.833 --> 19:30.085
What matters is
you caused this mess.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.466
I want you to see

19:36.842 --> 19:38.927
what happens
when you cheat on your family.

19:41.889 --> 19:42.890
Chief Seo.

19:59.406 --> 20:00.866
Fuck.

20:06.914 --> 20:07.915
Boss.

20:08.040 --> 20:08.916
Fuck!

20:08.999 --> 20:10.459
What are you planning to do now?

20:12.753 --> 20:14.838
That bastard
almost cost you your life.

20:21.386 --> 20:22.638
He has to pay for that.

20:30.479 --> 20:31.605
Try to endure it.

20:32.814 --> 20:33.815
Because it will hurt.

20:45.118 --> 20:47.663
You fucking son of a bitch.

20:50.624 --> 20:51.625
Let's see it.

20:53.460 --> 20:56.797
Damn son of a bitch.
Mieses Dreckschwein.

20:57.297 --> 21:00.509
Damn sneaky rat.

21:01.051 --> 21:02.636
Stupid trash bag.

21:05.973 --> 21:08.058
Damn son of a bitch.

21:09.768 --> 21:10.602
You piece of shit.

21:15.399 --> 21:18.527
I almost died because of you,
you fucker.

21:19.069 --> 21:21.571
OK? Fucking traitor.

21:28.078 --> 21:29.079
Boss.

21:30.497 --> 21:33.709
That should be enough for
him almost killing me.

21:36.586 --> 21:37.963
-Hey, Yongdae.
-Ja, Sir.

21:51.852 --> 21:53.312
Stay out of my sight.

21:54.896 --> 21:57.232
If I see you again,
I'll kill you.

22:02.029 --> 22:03.989
Heesung, Jungbae, Chief Seo, follow me.

22:04.072 --> 22:04.948
You too, Seungho.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.705
Consider yourself lucky, you bastard.

22:14.124 --> 22:15.208
Clean up here.

22:15.334 --> 22:16.460
Yes, Sir!

22:17.627 --> 22:19.087
Throw him far away.

22:19.421 --> 22:20.714
Yes, Sir.

22:30.265 --> 22:32.476
The Chinese are coming in two days.

22:33.769 --> 22:34.853
Why all of a sudden?

22:37.731 --> 22:40.150
Why don't we talk
about this more privately, sir?

22:40.233 --> 22:43.195
No, we need
more than just the three of us now.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.450
You already know what's going on, right?

22:50.243 --> 22:51.995
I'll take care of her.

22:52.788 --> 22:55.332
Prepare something
that will brighten her mood.

22:55.624 --> 22:56.792
Yes, Boss.

22:57.834 --> 22:58.835
And Heesung,

22:59.503 --> 23:01.755
find out if Kyungjin is up to something.

23:03.048 --> 23:04.049
Ok.

23:04.591 --> 23:05.759
Seo, take care of Seungho.

23:06.718 --> 23:07.719
Yes, Boss.

23:09.096 --> 23:10.097
You can go.

23:11.473 --> 23:15.352
HIDEOUT IN DONGHOBANG
CHINA

23:58.645 --> 24:00.856
SEOUL, DISTRICT ATTORNEY

24:00.981 --> 24:03.233
DRUG MANUFACTURERS
CONVICTED DRUG OFFENDERS

24:04.943 --> 24:06.570
Among those convicted of meth

24:06.653 --> 24:08.655
we examined all the meth cooks.

24:10.907 --> 24:11.908
YOON WONGIL

24:11.992 --> 24:13.660
Yoon Wongil.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.122
Why did she still go to China?

24:17.205 --> 24:18.707
To travel.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.125
She's not back?

24:20.208 --> 24:21.042
No.

24:22.210 --> 24:24.546
Traveling in China for half a year?

24:29.092 --> 24:30.218
Get the interpreter.

24:30.302 --> 24:31.595
Ich rufe Mr. Murayama an.

24:31.678 --> 24:32.679
Yes, Sir.

24:37.893 --> 24:39.311
-Captain Seok?
-Hallo, Sir.

24:39.394 --> 24:41.396
Do you know Professor Yoon?

24:41.480 --> 24:42.856
Die grauhaarige Dame.

24:43.982 --> 24:45.525
I have something big here.

24:45.609 --> 24:48.236
This trade could
not only Korea and Japan,

24:48.320 --> 24:50.989
but affect Korea, China and Japan.

24:51.740 --> 24:54.367
The Chinese are now
among our suspects.

24:55.285 --> 24:59.122
If Detective Park
attends the meeting with the Chinese tomorrow,

24:59.206 --> 25:01.374
we can better evaluate this theory .

25:02.042 --> 25:03.460
Do we ask him for help?

25:05.504 --> 25:08.882
NATIONAL DRUG COMMISSIONER
BEIJING, CHINA

25:19.434 --> 25:25.232
WANTED
YOON WONGIL, KOREAN, 73

25:35.450 --> 25:36.451
Hallo?

25:36.910 --> 25:38.537
Hi, Gicheul. It's me, Euijeong.

25:40.747 --> 25:41.748
Hi, Euijeong.

25:42.290 --> 25:44.000
I should have called you.

25:44.167 --> 25:46.503
How are you doing? Are you OK?

25:46.711 --> 25:48.046
Yes, thank you.

25:50.632 --> 25:52.968
Thank you for
coming to the funeral.

25:53.051 --> 25:55.428
You don't have to thank me,
that was my duty.

25:55.845 --> 25:57.389
Speaking of which,

25:57.472 --> 25:58.848
are you free tomorrow?

25:58.974 --> 26:00.100
Morning?

26:00.559 --> 26:03.019
Yes, tomorrow is the only day
I have free.

26:03.353 --> 26:04.604
Can we meet?

26:10.777 --> 26:13.280
Yes that works.
Let's meet tomorrow.

26:14.739 --> 26:16.199
Say Seungho please

26:17.325 --> 26:19.661
that I would also
like to thank him for his visit.

26:20.537 --> 26:21.538
I will do.

26:41.349 --> 26:43.268
I have an important appointment tomorrow.

26:43.351 --> 26:45.312
You take care of the Chinese.

26:47.606 --> 26:48.607
What happened?

26:51.151 --> 26:52.152
Yes, boss.

26:54.571 --> 26:56.072
Have you checked hospitals?

26:56.906 --> 26:57.907
Boss.

26:58.617 --> 27:01.286
Can I
answer that with Chief Seo?

27:04.706 --> 27:05.874
Finish eating first.

27:06.291 --> 27:07.292
Yes, Boss.

27:10.712 --> 27:11.671
Heesung.

27:12.631 --> 27:13.798
What's your baby's name?

27:15.133 --> 27:16.176
Jaeyoung.

27:17.344 --> 27:18.386
Hong Jaeyoung.

27:19.012 --> 27:20.221
That's a great name.

27:20.305 --> 27:21.306
I'm coming to visit.

27:21.556 --> 27:23.016
Secure. The baby is so sweet.

27:23.099 --> 27:24.726
Doesn't look like me at all.

27:25.560 --> 27:27.020
It looks like Hyeok.

27:29.773 --> 27:31.608
What did you want to say in confidence?

27:32.400 --> 27:33.652
Chief Seo.

27:34.319 --> 27:37.822
You investigated
where Oh Kyungjin was that day, right?

27:38.365 --> 27:39.324
Naturally.

27:39.616 --> 27:40.617
I'm just wondering

27:41.785 --> 27:43.912
how to locate our car

27:43.995 --> 27:45.372
and could inform them.

27:46.206 --> 27:50.085
He didn't chase our car.

27:51.169 --> 27:53.338
Jungbae followed us that day.

27:55.423 --> 27:56.925
Do you suspect Jungbae?

28:00.720 --> 28:02.138
You too, Chief Seo?

28:02.430 --> 28:05.141
Yes, I have that suspicion too.

28:05.850 --> 28:06.851
Boss.

28:14.067 --> 28:15.777
Let's do one final check.

28:17.654 --> 28:18.655
Boss.

28:19.406 --> 28:21.408
Our guests from China

28:21.491 --> 28:23.952
seem important
to our business.

28:25.954 --> 28:29.666
How about sending Seungho
while I check on Jungbae?

28:31.126 --> 28:32.585
You should be careful

28:32.669 --> 28:35.380
until we
are sure about Jungbae and Heesung.

28:45.390 --> 28:47.308
Jungbae is like my little brother.

28:49.227 --> 28:50.437
Do it professionally.

28:52.939 --> 28:53.940
Yes, Boss.

28:56.317 --> 28:57.360
Chief Seo.

29:05.994 --> 29:07.829
You can leave. Do it right.

29:07.912 --> 29:08.913
Yes, Boss.

29:24.596 --> 29:25.597
Hallo, Boss.

29:26.055 --> 29:28.808
You have the information
on all of my people, right?

29:29.184 --> 29:30.435
Yes, I have.

29:30.852 --> 29:32.896
I need to do some
research.

29:42.947 --> 29:44.491
If everything goes right,

29:44.574 --> 29:47.035
The old goes out
and the new comes in.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.087
You called, sir?

29:58.171 --> 29:59.714
Do you have any gifts for the Chinese?

30:00.131 --> 30:02.175
Yes, I have something expensive ready.

30:03.343 --> 30:04.344
Good job.

30:05.428 --> 30:06.554
Thanks, boss.

30:11.726 --> 30:12.727
Also ...

30:14.479 --> 30:15.730
... I would like to drink something,

30:17.023 --> 30:19.442
but I don't want to drink alone.

30:21.861 --> 30:22.862
And.

30:25.031 --> 30:27.867
Great. I was just about
to grab a drink myself.

30:28.576 --> 30:31.496
Should I prepare the drinks outside?

30:32.997 --> 30:34.123
Sounds good.

30:34.207 --> 30:35.208
Ok, Sir.

30:41.381 --> 30:43.299
PATROL PROTOCOL

31:14.998 --> 31:15.999
Sir.

31:17.292 --> 31:18.167
Sir?

31:22.839 --> 31:24.090
A simple survey.

31:24.173 --> 31:27.218
You can
answer my questions with a nod.

31:29.596 --> 31:32.015
Our investigation is stuck here.

31:32.682 --> 31:36.060
How did you know
which route Jung Gicheul would take?

31:37.270 --> 31:39.898
Did someone track his car
and tell them?

31:43.318 --> 31:44.527
Then how did you know?

31:48.489 --> 31:50.700
Did your gang follow his car,

31:50.783 --> 31:52.577
all the way from Seoul?

31:58.333 --> 32:00.168
With the car you were in?

32:10.887 --> 32:11.888
Aber Sir, ...

32:15.475 --> 32:17.352
... You were shot,

32:18.603 --> 32:20.605
but that you
don't recognize my face?

32:36.454 --> 32:37.830
I'm Seo Jongryeol.

32:42.710 --> 32:44.545
Nice to talk to you alone,

32:44.629 --> 32:45.797
without the other boys.

32:47.548 --> 32:48.466
It's been a while.

32:49.842 --> 32:50.802
Please.

32:52.178 --> 32:53.221
And.

32:53.304 --> 32:55.014
I'm sending Kwon Seungho

32:55.098 --> 32:56.808
tomorrow morning to Icheon port.

32:57.100 --> 32:58.559
Get some rest.

33:00.019 --> 33:02.772
Yes, Boss.

33:22.875 --> 33:24.085
That's life.

33:27.588 --> 33:29.799
It always gets you in the end.

33:31.259 --> 33:32.343
Take it like that.

33:33.761 --> 33:34.762
And this,

33:38.307 --> 33:39.976
like sinking into peaceful sleep.

34:02.165 --> 34:05.293
Since you bring it up...

34:05.960 --> 34:06.919
Also ...

34:09.922 --> 34:11.007
Just in case...

34:12.383 --> 34:13.593
Just to be sure,

34:14.969 --> 34:21.601
You didn't
suspect me or Heesung, did you?

34:24.854 --> 34:26.230
What are you talking about?

34:26.564 --> 34:27.690
Correct.

34:27.774 --> 34:29.192
Sorry. Forget it, boss.

35:00.640 --> 35:01.516
Hallo?

35:01.599 --> 35:02.809
Boss, this is Jongryeol.

35:03.601 --> 35:05.061
As per your instruction

35:05.186 --> 35:06.521
I killed Kang Geon.

35:07.396 --> 35:08.564
Heesung and Jungbae...

35:11.275 --> 35:12.360
...they are clean.

35:13.653 --> 35:15.822
Well done. Take a break.

35:19.534 --> 35:21.410
Who was that, boss?

35:22.995 --> 35:23.996
Nobody.

35:26.582 --> 35:27.583
Prost.

35:36.968 --> 35:38.177
If you think about it...

35:38.261 --> 35:39.137
Yes, Boss?

35:40.012 --> 35:43.808
You and me.
We were always together, right?

35:44.767 --> 35:48.646
Don't we both know that for sure, boss?

35:50.439 --> 35:54.318
Son of
pre-school stationer, Choi Jungbae.

35:54.443 --> 35:59.490
Why are you talking about the old days?
It is strange.

35:59.574 --> 36:01.617
Are you drunk?

36:02.368 --> 36:03.619
As the only student

36:04.996 --> 36:06.122
Yeoksam High

36:06.289 --> 36:08.207
Did you have an apartment?

36:09.584 --> 36:12.128
I was the only one living
in half a basement.

36:13.045 --> 36:14.046
The poor.

36:22.597 --> 36:25.391
Since it's just the two of us here,

36:26.475 --> 36:31.522
do not meet
with the Chinese yourself,

36:32.481 --> 36:34.609
because there is something important?

36:36.277 --> 36:37.361
There is nothing.

36:39.530 --> 36:42.408
Boss, like you said,

36:43.284 --> 36:46.913
I have
accompanied you all my life.

36:47.288 --> 36:49.665
I can read your mind pretty well.

36:50.666 --> 36:52.418
Is it because of that woman,
Yu Euijeong?

36:57.924 --> 36:59.675
-Jungbae.
-Ja, Boss?

37:01.385 --> 37:03.346
If you can read my mind,

37:04.680 --> 37:06.641
you should be able to look away too
.

37:11.896 --> 37:16.108
You're right.
But it doesn't make any sense.

37:16.984 --> 37:20.655
You can't marry a police officer.

37:22.365 --> 37:23.491
I can not?

37:24.909 --> 37:26.035
Please?

37:26.327 --> 37:27.536
They marry?

37:30.039 --> 37:31.415
Oh.

37:34.460 --> 37:38.130
Honestly,
I'm a little scared.

37:39.507 --> 37:41.759
What if
something bad happens because of her?

37:42.218 --> 37:44.178
I just want you to be clear

37:44.804 --> 37:49.433
that you
are starting something very dangerous.

37:55.564 --> 37:57.149
Some things are dangerous

37:59.110 --> 38:00.611
but worth a try, right?

38:03.739 --> 38:04.657
And.

38:06.033 --> 38:07.034
True.

38:08.202 --> 38:09.495
Let's drink to that.

38:46.574 --> 38:47.783
Hey.

38:58.586 --> 38:59.837
How are you?

39:23.194 --> 39:24.195
Choi Jungbae.

39:25.780 --> 39:26.781
And, Sir?

39:28.699 --> 39:29.700
Do you trust me?

39:37.249 --> 39:38.417
I trust them.

39:42.046 --> 39:43.506
I trust you too.

39:44.048 --> 39:46.342
Jung Gicheul is starting to trust me.

39:46.717 --> 39:48.677
From now on, whenever I'm free...

39:48.761 --> 39:52.139
Stop. Let's
not talk about it now.

39:54.767 --> 39:58.771
I don't want to think about it.

39:58.854 --> 39:59.772
Ok.

40:01.190 --> 40:02.691
I just want to think about us.

40:04.276 --> 40:05.569
Correct.

40:08.489 --> 40:09.365
Your mother.

40:11.492 --> 40:12.827
Was the funeral okay?

40:18.207 --> 40:19.333
I'm sorry.

40:23.587 --> 40:24.713
And your injury?

40:26.632 --> 40:27.675
Are you all right?

40:29.427 --> 40:30.886
Yes I'm fine.

40:34.014 --> 40:35.516
Eat up.

40:53.200 --> 40:55.327
You asshole.

40:58.914 --> 41:01.167
You're distracting me, you asshole.

41:01.459 --> 41:04.003
Think about it.

41:08.132 --> 41:13.846
Don’t you think
Gicheul trusts Seungho too much?

41:15.181 --> 41:16.182
What's wrong now?

41:16.265 --> 41:18.225
Does it bother me that he sent it?

41:18.309 --> 41:20.936
to the important meeting,
and not us.

41:23.147 --> 41:25.065
But you have a little free time.

41:28.402 --> 41:30.446
When he said "important appointment"

41:30.529 --> 41:32.656
Did he mean a date
with the policewoman, you know?

41:36.744 --> 41:38.787
However, that bothers me too.

41:38.871 --> 41:39.914
Or?

41:41.540 --> 41:43.709
Doesn't matter. It's his business.

41:45.377 --> 41:46.795
Let's take care of ours.

41:55.304 --> 41:59.058
Yoon Wongil. Did time for meth
and went to China.

41:59.975 --> 42:03.395
Check if she
is this Chinese guest.

42:04.188 --> 42:08.442
INCHEON PASSAGIER-TERMINAL

42:19.370 --> 42:21.247
Dear passengers...

42:32.550 --> 42:33.592
Are you from Mr. Jung?

42:34.176 --> 42:36.387
Yes that's me.

42:41.934 --> 42:42.935
Let's go.

42:58.367 --> 43:00.119
I said somewhere
nice.

43:01.203 --> 43:03.539
I wanted to visit the church.
It is a long time ago.

43:03.872 --> 43:04.999
Is that ok?

43:05.082 --> 43:07.418
Naturally.

43:20.097 --> 43:21.515
It would be nice,

43:21.974 --> 43:24.476
when your mother
went to church again.

43:44.788 --> 43:46.248
As far as I know,

43:46.874 --> 43:48.208
if you are from China,

43:48.334 --> 43:51.128
Only Korean Chinese
over 55 can enter Korea.

43:51.211 --> 43:54.381
That's why I did
n't expect anyone so young.

43:59.470 --> 44:01.472
We don't do something like this unprepared.

44:02.806 --> 44:04.350
I wasn't expecting a Korean woman.

44:06.477 --> 44:08.020
I am Korean-Chinese.

44:10.648 --> 44:13.525
And I didn't
expect someone so naive.

44:22.826 --> 44:26.205
Does the person
you came with take a taxi?

44:37.675 --> 44:39.551
Because of the recent breakdown...

44:39.635 --> 44:41.053
I would like to apologize.

44:41.929 --> 44:42.930
We are very sorry.

44:49.770 --> 44:50.813
Is this typical Korea?

44:52.189 --> 44:54.191
let others
apologize for you?

44:59.196 --> 45:00.948
One makes a mistake,

45:02.074 --> 45:03.450
the other apologizes.

45:28.350 --> 45:29.518
Very interesting.

45:55.169 --> 45:56.378
Get some rest.

45:57.212 --> 45:58.255
Your name?

45:58.338 --> 45:59.798
I'm Kwon Seungho.

46:33.332 --> 46:35.250
They are Korean Chinese.

46:35.375 --> 46:38.587
Their passports must be fake,
investigations are pointless.

46:39.213 --> 46:41.965
I wonder why they
came to Korea.

46:43.091 --> 46:45.427
To hand the material over to land now ?

46:46.178 --> 46:49.014
Customs in Incheon
would not be easy to get through.

46:50.015 --> 46:51.183
It has to be something else.

46:51.266 --> 46:52.518
Let's watch them.

46:52.601 --> 46:54.436
What are you actually doing here?

46:55.854 --> 46:57.648
Shouldn't you be with Gicheul?

46:57.731 --> 46:58.982
I'll do this here.

47:01.151 --> 47:02.736
Jung Gicheul is currently

47:02.820 --> 47:04.404
with Inspector Yu.

47:04.863 --> 47:07.699
Why is Euijeong meeting him?

47:07.783 --> 47:10.994
Didn't you see
what the bastard did at the funeral?

47:11.245 --> 47:13.914
Since you were injured,
she wanted to help us.

47:14.122 --> 47:15.207
Why ...

47:16.208 --> 47:19.086
Why is Euijeong helping us now?

47:20.003 --> 47:22.256
Damn, I should be
faced with such a decision

47:22.339 --> 47:24.341
not be asked first?

47:24.675 --> 47:27.177
It was urgent,
there was no time for it.

47:27.261 --> 47:29.096
We couldn't just watch.

47:29.263 --> 47:31.932
-Inspector You see it well too.
-Verdammt.

47:32.015 --> 47:35.310
She insisted on
doing everything she could to help you.

47:39.314 --> 47:40.941
You trust her, don't you?

47:41.149 --> 47:42.609
Don't think too much about it.

47:43.443 --> 47:46.488
Thanks to her, these are potential
Chinese drug producers

47:46.572 --> 47:47.906
right before our eyes.

47:47.990 --> 47:49.032
Damned.

47:58.917 --> 47:59.877
Excuse me.

52:02.035 --> 52:04.037
