00:01.668 --> 00:08.466
THE PERSONS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THE SERIES ARE FICTIONAL

00:20.186 --> 00:21.187
A long time ago!

00:29.612 --> 00:30.780
Let Satan ring.

00:33.408 --> 00:34.242
Oh boys.

00:35.452 --> 00:36.494
Hell no.

00:40.373 --> 00:43.626
This is your fault, asshole.

00:44.252 --> 00:45.545
His first time.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.924
Calm down and try again.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.511
Aim well, you bastard.

00:54.137 --> 00:55.472
Kill him.

00:55.555 --> 00:56.556
Hey.

00:57.432 --> 00:58.683
Hey!

00:58.767 --> 01:01.644
Do you miss on purpose?

01:11.946 --> 01:12.947
At the ready?

01:15.950 --> 01:17.160
No damn.

01:20.747 --> 01:22.248
Damn it.

01:26.628 --> 01:27.712
Damn...

01:28.838 --> 01:30.048
Son of a bitch.

01:51.653 --> 01:53.530
Killing is not easy.

01:55.031 --> 01:56.282
You need experience.

02:14.968 --> 02:19.264
THE WORST OF EVIL

02:43.705 --> 02:47.876
Seungho Kwon attended
Chudong Elementary School, which was closed in 1984.

02:47.959 --> 02:51.254
Then Sanguni Middle School,
which was closed in 1987.

02:51.337 --> 02:53.173
So there are no alumni groups.

02:53.256 --> 02:54.883
Gwangju Jeil High School

02:54.966 --> 02:58.595
he dropped out,
so he can't be found in the student lists.

02:59.053 --> 03:00.263
Interesting.

03:00.346 --> 03:01.890
Nothing can be verified.

03:01.973 --> 03:03.892
I guess so.

03:04.434 --> 03:05.435
Thank you.

03:08.146 --> 03:09.355
JANGSEOK KWON

03:09.439 --> 03:11.024
RIKOSREKISTERI
WONJU

03:11.107 --> 03:13.735
DRUG CRIME

03:16.446 --> 03:17.614
Pomo.

03:17.864 --> 03:21.701
That woman you met, Euijeong Yu.

03:23.161 --> 03:25.079
You said he was in SKPL.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.540
He's in the protection division.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.542
Why would they be watching us?

03:29.626 --> 03:33.213
Well, that's what he said.

03:33.296 --> 03:37.050
And who does he know? Seungho.

03:37.133 --> 03:40.178
What if Seungho SPIES on us
in his bread?

03:40.261 --> 03:41.763
In that case, oh damn...

03:41.846 --> 03:43.806
We would already be under arrest for murder.

03:43.890 --> 03:46.476
- Am I wrong?
-His father is a drug addict.

03:47.685 --> 03:48.895
That's why they met.

03:49.520 --> 03:51.606
So do you believe it?

03:51.689 --> 03:54.943
And the guys in Busan left this one.
Was that a coincidence too?

03:55.610 --> 03:57.820
The boss, after Seungho Kwon's arrival

03:58.029 --> 04:01.658
first police officer Euijeong Yu appears,
and then this.

04:01.741 --> 04:04.744
When we were attacked,
he hit the spot

04:04.827 --> 04:06.162
and took care of it.

04:06.663 --> 04:08.998
- Isn't there anything strange about that?
-Hey.

04:09.082 --> 04:12.168
He spotted them by chance
while patrolling with Yongdae.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.254
Right, again by chance.

04:14.712 --> 04:17.882
Don't you have too many coincidences
to think about at all?

04:17.966 --> 04:20.760
Damn it. What do you want us to do?

04:21.427 --> 04:23.054
If one thing rots, everything rots.

04:23.179 --> 04:24.931
Isn't that our motto?

04:44.242 --> 04:45.451
Where are you going?

04:45.910 --> 04:47.203
You can't go out today.

04:47.578 --> 04:48.705
Why not?

04:49.330 --> 04:50.331
What?

04:54.627 --> 04:55.712
What did you say?

05:00.967 --> 05:02.135
Nothing.

05:03.636 --> 05:04.637
I understand.

05:26.701 --> 05:27.535
Hey.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.750
Have you been drinking?

05:36.836 --> 05:38.171
Why couldn't you shoot?

05:44.052 --> 05:45.094
I am sorry.

05:47.263 --> 05:48.306
Hey.

05:49.140 --> 05:51.184
Do not worry. You did well.

05:54.312 --> 05:58.900
Just in case,

05:58.983 --> 06:01.569
you don't call the police

06:01.652 --> 06:03.821
because of guilt or something?

06:03.905 --> 06:05.782
Should I call the police?

06:06.240 --> 06:09.911
Well, that female police officer is a dictionary.

06:09.994 --> 06:14.499
I thought you could
call him and hang out.

06:14.874 --> 06:19.087
"Those bastards ordered someone to be killed."

06:19.504 --> 06:22.382
Stop it. I don't want to listen to that.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.926
You think you get to choose, abscess?

06:25.426 --> 06:26.552
Listen.

06:27.678 --> 06:31.182
So that I can wear gold watches on my wrists
instead of handcuffs,

06:31.265 --> 06:33.684
I've had to use my brain all my life
.

06:35.019 --> 06:38.064
You're Taeho's cousin, okay.

06:41.692 --> 06:43.611
But you're not one of us.

06:46.489 --> 06:49.075
What do you mean?

06:51.494 --> 06:53.621
Why not? Because I'm not from Gangnam huh?

07:04.006 --> 07:05.508
Oh boys.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.428
Chief Seo.

07:08.511 --> 07:09.887
Command him back to patrol.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.264
Mr.

07:19.814 --> 07:20.815
Hey, Seungho Kwon.

07:21.983 --> 07:23.109
Sir?

07:25.945 --> 07:27.613
I'm not from Gangnam either.

07:37.331 --> 07:39.459
If we arrest them for this,

07:39.625 --> 07:41.461
the investigation must be suspended.

07:42.336 --> 07:44.338
Let's identify the victim

07:44.422 --> 07:45.840
and let's hide this for now.

07:49.302 --> 07:52.930
Didn't Detective Park cause
quite a stir?

07:54.390 --> 07:56.267
He is apparently under suspicion again.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.978
Trust must be restored.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.231
Just this once.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.774
Could you help us?

08:06.152 --> 08:08.029
With what?

08:08.196 --> 08:12.241
Commissioner Yu, you are the only police officer,

08:12.325 --> 08:13.743
who can meet Gicheul Jung.

08:31.761 --> 08:32.929
ACCUSES AGAINST JUNG

08:33.012 --> 08:35.389
THE MURDERS OF KYUNGCHUL JANG AND AN UNKNOWN MAN

08:35.473 --> 08:36.641
ILLEGAL POSSESSION OF WEAPONS

09:11.008 --> 09:13.052
- Here is a list of companies.
-Clear.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.650
Hello?

09:27.733 --> 09:29.318
Hi Gicheul. Euijeong here.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.242
I asked Seungho for your number.

09:36.325 --> 09:37.451
I see.

09:39.870 --> 09:41.289
Would you like to go alone?

10:11.569 --> 10:12.903
Who do you meet?

10:42.933 --> 10:44.143
Wait here.

11:14.090 --> 11:15.049
Let's sit down.

11:19.887 --> 11:21.055
What the heck?

11:22.765 --> 11:25.685
Dohyung, what's going on?

11:25.768 --> 11:27.937
Why does Euijeong meet Gicheul Jung?

11:28.020 --> 11:29.689
Your wife will help us.

11:29.772 --> 11:31.148
With what?

11:31.232 --> 11:33.359
He tells Gicheul,

11:33.901 --> 11:37.071
that Seungho Kwon is trustworthy
and worth keeping around.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.698
Why should Euijeong...

11:40.241 --> 11:42.743
This investigation is dangerous.

11:43.452 --> 11:44.954
Why did you bring Euijeong along?

11:45.037 --> 11:46.580
This is wrong.

11:47.248 --> 11:48.708
He agreed himself.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.501
-Dohyung.
-Listen.

11:50.584 --> 11:52.795
We didn't ask your wife to come along.

11:52.878 --> 11:55.506
We asked for help
from SKPL's talented inspector,

11:55.589 --> 11:57.508
From Euijeong Yu.

11:59.176 --> 12:03.639
Junmo, we can trust Inspector Yu.

12:13.023 --> 12:15.401
How did you know my mother was sick?

12:15.484 --> 12:16.986
I know a police officer.

12:19.905 --> 12:21.532
The day we met

12:22.908 --> 12:24.827
was so surprising that I was rude.

12:25.286 --> 12:26.245
And you weren't.

12:27.329 --> 12:30.875
By the way, you're even more handsome.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.046
Ta-daa.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.011
Did you keep this?

12:42.094 --> 12:45.556
I thought you'd like
to have it sometime.

12:47.183 --> 12:48.225
Euijeong.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.188
Do you remember?

13:03.157 --> 13:04.116
Do you like it?

13:04.617 --> 13:05.743
I like.

13:05.993 --> 13:08.245
If you find something nice in the church shop,

13:08.329 --> 13:09.497
buy me too

13:09.580 --> 13:11.707
I'll buy you something better.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.167
More expensive.

13:13.417 --> 13:14.752
When?

13:19.423 --> 13:20.591
-Wait a minute.
-What now?

13:38.192 --> 13:39.985
What would have happened to us?

13:40.069 --> 13:41.403
without what happened to mom?

13:52.790 --> 13:54.416
I hope you are kind to Seungho.

13:59.004 --> 14:01.423
He suffered a lot as a child.

14:01.507 --> 14:03.092
Take good care of him.

14:12.351 --> 14:14.478
It must be hard to take care of your mother.

14:14.854 --> 14:15.980
It does not matter.

14:16.772 --> 14:18.858
I try to fit in whenever I can.

14:18.983 --> 14:21.193
Thanks, but you don't have to.

14:21.277 --> 14:22.695
You're busy too.

14:26.615 --> 14:30.995
Does your husband ever visit your mother?

14:32.746 --> 14:37.167
The nurse thought I was her son-in-law.

14:45.426 --> 14:47.094
If she asks about your husband,

14:47.177 --> 14:48.512
just say you broke up

14:49.597 --> 14:51.473
and leave it at that.

14:55.102 --> 14:56.604
Actually, I quit.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.650
But only part of my family knows.

15:02.443 --> 15:03.736
I only know cops.

15:03.819 --> 15:06.572
I was afraid that the information would spread
and problems would follow.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.992
I didn't even tell mom.

15:15.414 --> 15:18.042
Everything hurts and happens.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.085
No worries.

15:27.134 --> 15:29.345
Did you know that Euijeong broke up?

15:29.428 --> 15:30.471
In.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.850
Don't tell anyone I met him.

15:35.851 --> 15:38.562
We have known him for a long time,
so it suits us.

15:39.688 --> 15:41.482
However, others will not like it.

15:42.232 --> 15:43.400
He's a policeman.

15:45.319 --> 15:46.612
All right, boss.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.198
Welcome, boss.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.756
I guess I'll see him often from now on,

16:06.465 --> 16:07.675
just so you know.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.136
All right, boss.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.014
Patrolling is enough for now.

16:56.265 --> 16:57.683
Hello?

17:01.270 --> 17:02.396
Hi dad.

17:07.735 --> 17:08.777
Clear.

17:49.485 --> 17:50.319
Seung Ho.

17:51.820 --> 17:52.821
Yeah, boss?

18:00.954 --> 18:02.039
Get dressed.

18:03.874 --> 18:05.626
What now?

18:06.085 --> 18:08.128
Euijeong's mother has passed away.

18:23.102 --> 18:28.398
CHAPEL

18:59.388 --> 19:00.931
Hold on, boss.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.142
I've thought about it.

19:03.225 --> 19:05.394
I think you should go alone.

19:06.520 --> 19:10.023
It looks better if you go alone

19:10.107 --> 19:11.608
to comfort Euijeong.

19:11.692 --> 19:14.903
I'll go pay
my respects later.

19:26.039 --> 19:29.543
REST IN PEACE
GICHEUL JUNG

20:03.118 --> 20:04.203
Are you okay?

20:18.842 --> 20:20.802
We went to the same church.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.471
He knew the mother well.

20:41.198 --> 20:43.450
- This is my wife.
- Day.

20:47.829 --> 20:49.248
Thank you for coming.

20:51.291 --> 20:53.919
I am sure he is resting in heaven now.

21:06.181 --> 21:08.350
How did you know? I didn't inform you.

21:09.893 --> 21:12.604
I told you I know the police.

21:19.987 --> 21:21.571
Seungho, thanks for coming too.

21:26.660 --> 21:27.661
Of course.

21:31.248 --> 21:32.749
Uncle.

21:33.458 --> 21:35.460
Can you solve this for me?

21:56.773 --> 21:58.358
Uncle is here.

21:58.442 --> 22:00.736
Let's go figure it out.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.953
EUMSEONG POLICE STATION
DETECTIVE JUNMO PARK

22:12.914 --> 22:16.251
Gicheul, shall we go get some oxygen?

22:16.960 --> 22:17.961
Sure.

22:25.302 --> 22:28.847
It breaks my heart to see you alone.

22:30.307 --> 22:31.767
You shouldn't be lonely.

22:34.936 --> 22:36.980
I'm starting to hate your ex-husband.

22:38.732 --> 22:40.442
Will he appear now?

22:48.200 --> 22:49.201
This is my husband.

22:51.536 --> 22:52.746
Here is my friend from church.

22:53.163 --> 22:55.540
I have met fellow church members at our wedding

22:55.624 --> 22:56.917
and in our homesickness.

22:57.793 --> 22:59.252
I haven't met you before.

23:13.475 --> 23:15.185
Since you immediately came to visit,

23:15.602 --> 23:17.604
you must be a very close friend.

23:18.271 --> 23:21.066
I went to see his mother
in the hospital a while ago.

23:21.483 --> 23:23.652
And he told me

23:25.070 --> 23:29.032
that he likes his son-in-law more
than his two sons.

23:33.495 --> 23:36.206
When was the last time you
visited him in the hospital?

23:38.208 --> 23:41.211
I know you broke up,
but did it even cross your mind,

23:41.294 --> 23:44.339
that he would like to see his son-in-law
before he dies?

23:51.888 --> 23:54.307
Do you even have the right to mourn him?

23:55.016 --> 23:56.017
Gicheul, stop it.

23:58.311 --> 23:59.312
Hey.

24:00.480 --> 24:03.024
We don't talk about other people's family matters,

24:03.108 --> 24:05.110
especially a grieving family.

24:05.193 --> 24:06.778
You should stop too.

24:15.495 --> 24:18.415
There will still be guests,
so say goodbye and come back inside.

24:39.519 --> 24:40.520
I will go.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.647
Thank you for visiting.

24:44.191 --> 24:45.442
Thanks to you too, Seungho.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.114
I am praying for your mother.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.706
If you need, call anytime.

25:32.697 --> 25:34.991
I'm going to the bathroom.

25:48.463 --> 25:49.464
Junmo.

25:49.965 --> 25:51.007
Hei, Junmo!

25:52.676 --> 25:54.261
Why didn't you report to us?

25:57.681 --> 26:01.977
At least I have to pay
my last respects to my mother-in-law.

26:08.650 --> 26:11.820
Do you want to abandon our operation?

26:15.574 --> 26:16.866
I'm really sorry, Junmo.

26:17.826 --> 26:18.827
I...

26:20.328 --> 26:22.622
I'll stay until he's buried.

26:22.914 --> 26:24.082
Damn damn.

26:24.708 --> 26:25.917
I'm really sorry.

27:06.249 --> 27:08.335
Does the food taste good?

27:08.960 --> 27:13.131
Yes ma'am. It is delicious.

27:17.052 --> 27:18.345
How is your work going?

27:18.637 --> 27:24.100
Very. I try my best.

27:25.518 --> 27:29.022
That's how it should be. Trust yourself.

27:29.105 --> 27:31.024
- I will do that.
-Do what you must...

27:31.107 --> 27:32.567
-Yes.
-...and what you want.

27:32.651 --> 27:33.735
Yes ma'am.

27:34.402 --> 27:36.529
Euijeong's father and brother do not tolerate,

27:36.613 --> 27:38.114
but don't worry about it.

27:42.744 --> 27:45.997
Euijeong likes you a lot, Junmo.

27:46.414 --> 27:49.042
And I like that you smile.

27:49.709 --> 27:51.670
That's the most important thing, isn't it?

27:57.509 --> 28:00.220
When we laugh and spend time together,

28:00.303 --> 28:01.805
we become a family.

28:03.306 --> 28:04.391
That's right.

28:04.474 --> 28:05.600
Thank you.

28:43.346 --> 28:47.058
Seungho, do you know how your mother is?

28:51.479 --> 28:52.355
Yes.

28:53.606 --> 28:58.361
She reportedly had a baby
with some guy

28:59.821 --> 29:01.573
and live contentedly.

29:04.242 --> 29:06.453
Don't you hate him
when he didn't look for you?

29:06.536 --> 29:07.454
Do I hate him?

29:08.288 --> 29:09.581
I'm not sure.

29:12.417 --> 29:13.418
Instead of him

29:15.336 --> 29:18.214
I wouldn't even want to think about our family.

29:24.888 --> 29:25.722
Deuce.

29:26.765 --> 29:31.853
My father often beat my mother.

29:33.855 --> 29:37.275
During high school, we ran away from home
with my siblings and mother.

29:39.360 --> 29:41.571
I said I'd kill dad
if he looked for us.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.618
That bastard...

29:49.037 --> 29:50.580
He still came, undeterred.

29:55.251 --> 29:56.419
So he died.

30:02.509 --> 30:04.177
Not by me, but by my mother.

30:16.397 --> 30:17.607
Pomo.

30:21.778 --> 30:23.488
I want to succeed.

30:26.282 --> 30:27.367
At first

30:28.076 --> 30:31.037
I came to work for you
to get revenge for Taeho.

30:33.248 --> 30:34.249
But now

30:37.544 --> 30:39.963
I want to be successful just like you.

30:41.589 --> 30:43.800
I don't want to live as the son of a drug addict.

30:44.509 --> 30:45.385
Do you understand?

30:45.593 --> 30:46.886
In Gangnam.

30:48.179 --> 30:50.056
The man who succeeded in Gangnam,

30:52.892 --> 30:54.310
Seungho Kwon.

30:56.980 --> 30:58.606
I want to be him.

31:09.784 --> 31:10.827
I will help you.

31:12.412 --> 31:13.580
Help me, boss.

31:16.332 --> 31:18.167
But I want a return favor.

31:18.251 --> 31:22.255
I'll do anything.

31:22.338 --> 31:23.339
What do you want?

31:26.718 --> 31:28.845
I want the me and Euijeong thing to work.

31:30.013 --> 31:31.639
I need your help with that.

31:33.349 --> 31:34.350
And your support.

32:06.716 --> 32:10.011
Alright. I'll do it.

32:15.266 --> 32:16.225
I will help you.

32:25.818 --> 32:26.945
Pomo.

32:27.278 --> 32:28.321
I am

32:29.322 --> 32:32.158
sailed the Pacific
for a year at a time.

32:33.284 --> 32:34.953
Now I'm starting to feel queasy.

32:35.912 --> 32:37.622
I miss the smell of the sea.

32:40.416 --> 32:42.585
The next time you go fishing,

32:45.213 --> 32:46.923
could i come along?

32:47.256 --> 32:48.883
Just like in that picture.

32:49.801 --> 32:52.428
I would like to go on a fishing trip with you.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.686
It is the hobby of our three leaders.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.689
And you would like to join already?

33:09.862 --> 33:12.907
Why not?

33:13.157 --> 33:14.075
No...

33:15.159 --> 33:17.620
Didn't Euijeong ask
to take care of me?

33:21.249 --> 33:22.875
Let me come along.

33:30.174 --> 33:31.634
Wait and see.

33:36.347 --> 33:37.223
All right, boss.

33:46.566 --> 33:47.734
Thank you.

33:55.116 --> 33:56.117
Pomo.

33:57.827 --> 33:59.287
I'll do my best.

34:10.548 --> 34:11.674
Call, press one.

34:12.008 --> 34:13.092
Leave a message,

34:13.176 --> 34:14.969
press two.

34:16.012 --> 34:17.388
Please leave a message.

34:19.057 --> 34:20.308
Hey, Euijeong.

34:24.562 --> 34:25.563
Me here.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.985
I'm really sorry.

34:33.029 --> 34:35.573
Sorry I couldn't visit your mom.

34:41.996 --> 34:43.247
I just...

34:45.458 --> 34:49.212
Sorry to cause this mess.

35:01.432 --> 35:05.812
Sorry I was so stupid.

35:08.314 --> 35:09.524
And...

35:13.319 --> 35:15.113
I just...

35:17.073 --> 35:18.991
Sorry I'm not good enough.

35:28.918 --> 35:30.503
Sorry for everything.

35:35.216 --> 35:36.384
Sorry.

35:40.221 --> 35:41.430
Euijeong.

35:48.855 --> 35:50.064
I love you.

36:04.912 --> 36:06.289
Does anyone have a fire?

36:25.892 --> 36:27.143
No thanks.

36:35.276 --> 36:36.277
Hard, huh?

36:36.903 --> 36:39.071
Always have to follow the boss's schedule,

36:39.864 --> 36:43.409
and at night there is no place of your own
to stay.

36:44.660 --> 36:45.703
It does not matter.

36:47.371 --> 36:48.664
Do not worry.

36:48.748 --> 36:49.874
Around next spring

36:49.957 --> 36:52.418
the boss will probably give you your own place.

36:52.710 --> 36:53.961
Thank you.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.925
You look cute when you smile.

37:00.426 --> 37:01.802
- Seungho.
-So?

37:02.386 --> 37:03.471
I'm younger than you.

37:03.554 --> 37:06.057
Do you mind if I speak casually?

37:07.350 --> 37:08.851
None.

37:08.935 --> 37:10.019
Really?

37:11.938 --> 37:13.940
What did you and the boss do yesterday?

37:14.523 --> 37:16.359
Where did you go?

37:18.945 --> 37:20.613
Didn't he tell?

37:23.199 --> 37:24.367
Told.

37:24.450 --> 37:25.534
What he said?

37:30.748 --> 37:32.541
Should I tell you

37:32.625 --> 37:34.418
what did the boss say to me?

37:38.381 --> 37:41.592
He told it all, so you can tell it.

37:48.724 --> 37:50.309
We visited Taeho's urn vault.

38:01.070 --> 38:05.241
Why is it such a big secret?

38:05.366 --> 38:09.495
Tell me about
all such things. Is it clear?

38:37.398 --> 38:38.649
Thank you.

38:38.733 --> 38:41.360
When you were driving that night.

38:48.492 --> 38:53.289
I hope we will continue to get along.

38:59.587 --> 39:01.047
Choose your leaders wisely.

39:03.549 --> 39:05.051
I believe I will.

39:07.595 --> 39:10.514
Neither of us are from Gangnam.

39:18.898 --> 39:21.609
The higher ups seemed to have a way
of making big bucks.

39:23.152 --> 39:24.820
We should figure it out soon too.

39:26.364 --> 39:27.573
True, sir.

40:15.204 --> 40:16.414
JAEGEON LOGISTICS

40:19.417 --> 40:20.960
I was going to tip over.

40:21.043 --> 40:23.087
-Sorry.
- Focus.

40:23.170 --> 40:24.672
Corotan.

40:25.923 --> 40:28.008
Are you paying? You have hand cards.

40:28.884 --> 40:30.177
I'll pay and see.

40:30.803 --> 40:31.971
Who are you?

40:32.680 --> 40:33.889
Who the hell are you?

40:33.973 --> 40:35.433
Is that Geon Kang from Busan?

40:36.434 --> 40:38.811
Hi Geo. Did you come alone?

40:44.942 --> 40:46.026
What brings you here?

40:53.284 --> 40:54.743
Let's start a war, together.

41:05.212 --> 41:06.088
Am I there?

41:07.131 --> 41:09.091
I've never seen this bastard before.

41:09.175 --> 41:10.009
What?

41:11.844 --> 41:14.221
The picture has probably been edited.

41:15.014 --> 41:18.058
Who the hell did this?

41:18.142 --> 41:22.062
What kind of fool would dare to do that?

41:22.146 --> 41:23.772
Gicheul Jung Gangnam Unionist.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.026
Help me,

41:27.109 --> 41:29.111
then you get Nonhyeon-dong
and Yeoksam-dong.

41:38.329 --> 41:39.163
Fine.

41:40.456 --> 41:41.457
What the hell?

41:44.919 --> 41:45.920
I'm sure you know me.

41:46.962 --> 41:47.880
We need to talk.

41:47.963 --> 41:50.090
-Damn...
-Wait.

41:50.174 --> 41:52.134
I haven't finished yet.

41:54.553 --> 41:55.763
Have you eaten yet?

41:55.846 --> 41:58.182
When playing billiards,
Chinese food is a must.

42:03.938 --> 42:05.147
I can offer.

42:06.190 --> 42:07.775
- How much?
-18,000 won.

42:07.900 --> 42:08.984
- 18 thousand?
-So.

42:09.985 --> 42:11.111
Wait.

42:15.616 --> 42:17.493
You're in Gangnam Union right?

42:17.910 --> 42:18.953
What do you want?

42:23.249 --> 42:24.625
Nice to meet you.

42:29.380 --> 42:32.091
When there are no parents in the organization,

42:32.216 --> 42:34.927
but all are the same age,

42:35.010 --> 42:37.221
there will certainly be a lot of disagreement.

42:39.890 --> 42:41.809
Because you are so successful,

42:41.892 --> 42:44.186
my boss wants to talk to you.

42:48.315 --> 42:50.651
You'll be fine, young man.

42:50.734 --> 42:51.944
Nice bar.

42:56.824 --> 42:59.785
How long do you think you can maintain
your rich lifestyle?

43:00.244 --> 43:02.371
Imagine yourself two, three

43:02.871 --> 43:04.873
or ten years from now.

43:05.833 --> 43:07.418
Nothing has changed.

43:09.211 --> 43:12.047
You still bow down to your own age

43:12.381 --> 43:14.341
and you are looked down upon.

43:16.010 --> 43:18.554
This whole gang is abnormal.

43:19.179 --> 43:21.432
It depends on one man,
Gicheul Jung,

43:21.515 --> 43:22.850
and his charisma.

43:24.810 --> 43:28.063
What do you do if he gets stabbed to death?

43:28.147 --> 43:30.441
Our gang controls 50% of Seoul,

43:31.400 --> 43:33.819
and we are ready to take you along.

43:36.113 --> 43:40.868
Our organization is nationwide
and growing rapidly.

43:42.244 --> 43:44.413
You are not the only one,

43:44.496 --> 43:45.748
which we are trying to recruit.

43:47.333 --> 43:50.711
If you refuse,
someone else will accept our Offer.

43:51.629 --> 43:52.963
Consider carefully.

43:53.964 --> 43:56.634
For now, we just want to

43:57.509 --> 43:59.803
that you are observing what Gicheul Jung is doing.

44:00.888 --> 44:03.307
Where does he go and with whom.

44:04.266 --> 44:08.228
We want to know it in real time.

44:16.445 --> 44:18.030
- I'm pissed.
-Hey.

44:18.489 --> 44:21.241
Gicheul, I need to
get to the hospital right now.

44:22.034 --> 44:23.827
Hyeok was forced into action.

44:23.911 --> 44:26.163
I hear bleeding from the vagina.

44:26.246 --> 44:27.706
What if the baby is in danger?

44:27.790 --> 44:28.957
What do you mean?

44:29.124 --> 44:32.419
I don't think I'll be able to go fishing tomorrow.
Go without me.

44:32.503 --> 44:33.671
-Hey...
-I'm sorry.

44:33.754 --> 44:34.838
Wait.

44:36.048 --> 44:37.091
Keep us updated.

44:37.633 --> 44:38.509
Oh shit.

44:40.219 --> 44:44.598
Boss, I don't think we can do it alone.

44:44.682 --> 44:48.102
We need someone
to keep watch at the port.

44:51.146 --> 44:52.898
Let's take one of the men with us.

44:52.981 --> 44:54.733
- We don't say what we do.
-Alright.

44:54.817 --> 44:56.902
- He can wait at the port.
-Clear.

44:56.985 --> 45:00.114
I ask Chief Seo to get ready.

45:00.614 --> 45:01.615
Seunghoa.

45:04.618 --> 45:06.328
Don't bother, boss.

45:07.079 --> 45:08.997
I said we won't tell him.

45:14.628 --> 45:16.588
It's way too early.

45:21.301 --> 45:22.636
Jungbae.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.138
Yeah, boss.

45:24.847 --> 45:26.306
If we include Seungho,

45:27.599 --> 45:29.476
we will find out

45:30.811 --> 45:32.229
is he in touch with the driver.

45:33.647 --> 45:35.482
All right, boss.

45:41.864 --> 45:42.865
Seung Ho.

45:43.282 --> 45:44.408
-Mr?
-Have you washed?

45:44.491 --> 45:45.325
I am.

45:45.409 --> 45:47.286
Don't drink today. Go to bed early.

45:47.786 --> 45:49.580
Is there something going on?

45:50.122 --> 45:52.291
You're asking too much again.

45:53.917 --> 45:55.919
We're going fishing, so be ready.

45:56.837 --> 45:59.047
I understand.

47:01.485 --> 47:04.196
May I ask why we changed cars?

47:07.950 --> 47:09.868
Are we making sure we are not tracked?

47:19.837 --> 47:23.382
Can you even fish in the middle of the night?

47:33.517 --> 47:35.227
-Hello?
-Hello, boss.

47:35.310 --> 47:38.730
Flat tire, I'm stuck here.

47:38.814 --> 47:39.690
Sorry.

47:40.232 --> 47:43.068
That slip almost killed me.

47:44.403 --> 47:47.948
I'm calling for help.

47:49.157 --> 47:50.784
Could you go ahead?

47:52.160 --> 47:53.245
Alright.

48:18.312 --> 48:19.438
What the hell?

48:19.980 --> 48:21.523
Let them go ahead.

48:56.391 --> 48:57.559
Oh shit.

49:10.697 --> 49:12.240
-Stick to the board!
-Damn it.

49:41.353 --> 49:42.437
Damn it!

49:42.938 --> 49:44.147
That big head!

Satan!

49:56.159 --> 49:57.119
Are you okay?

50:00.372 --> 50:02.457
What the hell is this?

50:03.166 --> 50:04.209
Work now.

50:08.880 --> 50:09.881
Movement!

50:14.469 --> 50:15.387
There!

50:16.263 --> 50:17.222
Help!

50:19.391 --> 50:20.767
You assholes!

50:33.238 --> 50:34.740
Son of a bitch!

50:38.326 --> 50:39.369
Let go!

50:39.494 --> 50:40.912
Catch them!

50:54.051 --> 50:54.926
Speed ​​up!

50:55.010 --> 50:56.303
God!

50:56.386 --> 50:57.304
Short!
