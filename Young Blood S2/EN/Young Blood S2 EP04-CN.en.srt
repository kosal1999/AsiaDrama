1
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,413
I will arrange it for you

2
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:54,581
Sneak back to Xingqing Mansion

3
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:55,982
Brother Ning Ling will never do it

4
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:57,684
Let your son and son be in danger

5
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:00,854
How can we live up to our comrades in life and death?

6
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:03,123
This is me, brother Ning Ling

7
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,424
The bottom line of being a human being

8
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:05,291
Thank you, Your Highness

9
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,300
Thank you, Your Highness, for planning for them

10
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,170
no way

11
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,372
No preparation before

12
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,040
they can't escape

13
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,743
Now that it's been seen, it's useless

14
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,082
Kill it

15
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,470
Wang Kuan and the others are already in the market.

16
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,172
you are already safe

17
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:03,983
Yuan Zhongxin

18
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:07,620
Xiao Xue

19
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:09,789
Xiao Xue

20
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,224
Chief

21
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,893
You escaped

22
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:16,529
Who let you go?

23
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,366
Didn't you listen to what Yanei said?

24
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,568
We escaped

25
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:23,503
It is absolutely impossible for Yuan Hao

26
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:24,971
Let you escape from the military camp

27
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:26,506
What else?

28
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:28,107
Are we ghosts?

29
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:29,609
Don't talk nonsense

30
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,411
The shadows are all there

31
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:34,147
Whatever

32
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,182
I'm still thinking about conscription and crusade

33
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,383
To avenge you?

34
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:37,884
Then do I still have to

35
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:38,718
I was deeply moved.

36
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:40,019
Yuan Zhongxin

37
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,822
You should know about your father, right?

38
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,624
What he does has nothing to do with me

39
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:47,560
But your last name is Yuan too.

40
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,729
Shaodu unified the army

41
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,697
Trouble

42
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,167
Your father said

43
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,002
Listen to me everything

44
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:03,843
what do you want to do

45
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:05,278
The Yuan family rebelled

46
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,480
The opening of the examination for the capture of Yuan Zhongxin

47
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:08,948
Yuan Zhongxin said it all

48
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:09,882
Nothing to do with him

49
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:11,618
And Yuan Zhongxin refused

50
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:12,285
He is from Song Dynasty

51
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,620
Is he from Song Dynasty?

52
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,188
It doesn't matter what you say

53
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:18,925
Princess Zhao

54
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,527
I have with me a secret order from the Privy Council

55
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:22,462
Do you want to see it?

56
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:24,664
I'm fine

57
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,601
He said he would go back to Kaifeng and be tried.

58
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,970
On the way back, I am not a criminal.

59
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,308
For the sake of Princess Zhao,

60
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,576
You are allowed to travel together

61
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,810
please

62
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,121
Let you go

63
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,622
But Wei Zhuoran

64
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,026
No wonder

65
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,096
After arriving in Lingnan, there was no trace

66
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,766
You Qizhai

67
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,267
It's really extraordinary

68
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:02,969
six people

69
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,203
Half have problems

70
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,039
Who else

71
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,609
Zhao Jian, Wang Kuan and you

72
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,210
I can still trust it

73
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,079
What happened to Xiao Jing?

74
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,285
The rescuer

75
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:20,987
All dead

76
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:22,388
yes

77
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:23,456
Three people in total

78
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,491
Save the Song people and kill their colleagues

79
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:26,559
after

80
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,761
He was killed again in the corner of the camp

81
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,030
It should be the Song people who killed people and silenced them

82
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:33,599
This person has been saved

83
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,101
What else are you trying to say?

84
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,703
Song people were cruel

85
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,204
They can do anything

86
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,374
really

87
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:43,142
this has arrived

88
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:45,545
It's outrageous

89
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,013
Father

90
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:49,615
Since someone rescued

91
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,617
It shows that there is another mastermind behind the assassination.

92
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:52,985
This matter must be investigated strictly

93
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:55,488
Yes

94
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,623
I'll leave this to you

95
00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:58,958
I

96
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,528
Who else can I trust but you?

97
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,430
yes

98
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:05,932
Go ahead

99
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:26,419
Qing Tianzi

100
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,888
It was done by the prince.

101
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,159
I actually don’t really hope to be the prince

102
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:34,827
I intercepted

103
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,929
However, the three young men were still

104
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:37,897
Let it go

105
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:40,066
I heard about it

106
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,468
Mr. Wei's son

107
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:43,936
and those young men

108
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:45,104
A close friend

109
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:45,571
Right

110
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:48,007
Please forgive me, Lord Qingtian

111
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,344
Those young men

112
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:53,212
Life or death is not important

113
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,083
Important

114
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:58,217
I know Brother Ning Ling

115
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:59,886
It would be fine if he was the mastermind behind it

116
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,487
Mr. Wei

117
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,589
It depends on you

118
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,459
This Yuan Zhongxin and Zhao Jian

119
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,661
Look

120
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:09,862
Sincere and sincere

121
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:19,338
Born in Song Dynasty

122
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,908
If you grew up in the Song Dynasty, you are a Song Dynasty person.

123
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,046
I also feel that way

124
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:30,550
Sometimes

125
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,285
ignorance

126
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,521
Not necessarily a bad thing

127
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:38,090
what do you mean

128
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:39,459
Not interesting

129
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,028
Feel free to express your feelings

130
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,198
The affairs of the Song Dynasty have nothing to do with me

131
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,769
So what should the prince do?

132
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:51,137
take it easy

133
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,105
First give him his military power little by little

134
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:53,973
take it back

135
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,210
After all, he is his son

136
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,778
It can't be the end of the world, right?

137
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,226
Sister Zhao, are you okay?

138
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,134
No more delay

139
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,204
Set off overnight to return to the Song Dynasty

140
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,280
It's time for us to go

141
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,147
Shaodu unified the army

142
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,015
thank you

143
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,251
Why should my father help you?

144
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,889
Maybe one day we will meet again

145
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:44,824
Set off

146
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,125
I heard about it

147
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:23,496
Yuan Zhongxin

148
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,199
You are a member of Qizhai

149
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:28,200
this matter

150
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:29,802
will never change

151
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:09,442
Let's go

152
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,684
Shaodu unified the army

153
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,052
your father is here

154
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:31,297
father

155
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,404
Why do you want Yuzhou Army?

156
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:39,772
Listen to that Lu Nanshan

157
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,407
Aren’t we going to kill Yuan Hao?

158
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:47,947
Yuan Hao

159
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:49,849
Of course, kill

160
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:53,719
Then why stop it?

161
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:54,854
Wang Kuan and others

162
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:56,922
Yuan Hao is going to die

163
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:58,824
But you can't die on the altar

164
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:01,427
I ask you

165
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:03,963
Who will succeed Yuan Hao if he dies?

166
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:06,565
Brother Ning Ling

167
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,401
How is Ning Lingge like a person?

168
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,770
Naturally cunning and vicious

169
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,838
If Yuan Hao died

170
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,408
Will Brother Ning Ling take revenge for him?

171
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,143
That's natural

172
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,078
He wants to be justified

173
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,579
This revenge must be avenged

174
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,050
are you worried

175
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:25,918
A young man from the Song Dynasty was killed by him

176
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,021
Who cares whether they live or die?

177
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,423
I ask you

178
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:31,757
If Wang Kuan and the others

179
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:33,359
Assassination on the altar

180
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:34,760
What identity will you use?

181
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,562
They pretend to be our Youzhou Army

182
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,164
If Yuan Hao died

183
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:38,864
Just those few

184
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,666
Song Dynasty Youth

185
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,001
Not enough

186
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:42,968
Brother Ning Ling wants to

187
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,370
After working with us

188
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:46,972
Destroy our Yuzhou army together

189
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,441
Yuan Hao is going to die

190
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,710
But you can’t catch up with our Youzhou Army

191
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:54,880
Then why believe it

192
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,082
Where is Lu Nanshan?

193
00:11:58,584 --> 00:11:59,585
buy and sell

194
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,088
Lu Nanshan borrowed trade routes

195
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:03,522
Gave us military rations

196
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,291
Lu Nanshan was from the Song Dynasty

197
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:06,892
He gave us military rations

198
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,296
Could the Song Dynasty still do such a thing?

199
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:11,931
Do you think their court

200
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,365
Can you agree to such a thing?

201
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:15,668
so

202
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,803
Lu Nanshan was not following orders

203
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,506
He adjusts the food in private

204
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,408
Help other countries’ armies

205
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,410
Such a big deal

206
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,579
Why is he doing this?

207
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,347
One

208
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,584
If the Song Dynasty goes to war with us

209
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,085
He wants our Youzhou Army

210
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:33,919
join forces with him

211
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:35,888
one more

212
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,824
Why do I always feel

213
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:39,959
He's staring at those

214
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,627
Where is the assassin?

215
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:43,562
shouldn't

216
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,030
They have no grudges

217
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,867
who cares

218
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:58,444
Years of fierce fighting in Daxia

219
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,979
Almost at the end of the rope

220
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:01,847
With this military ration

221
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:02,581
can alleviate

222
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:04,817
The urgent need of our Youzhou Army

223
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:06,919
Girl

224
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,889
As long as we can keep our Youzhou Army

225
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:11,524
others

226
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:13,459
None of it matters

227
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:17,463
What about Yuan Hao?

228
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:23,469
Take it easy

229
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:26,772
Kill Yuan Hao in no hurry

230
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:28,140
Important opportunity

231
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:29,642
Waiting for the sky

232
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,310
As long as we Yuzhou Army

233
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,478
Strong military power

234
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:34,613
us

235
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,816
I can wait

236
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:38,784
yes

237
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:34,306
Land Adult

238
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:39,278
Yuan Zhongxin

239
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:40,779
Get off the car

240
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:51,457
Stay

241
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:53,893
That's it

242
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:57,830
Where are we sending people to?

243
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,465
The Privy Council took over

244
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:00,733
Imprisoned

245
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,734
How to interrogate

246
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:03,736
Princess Zhao

247
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,738
Your father's funeral

248
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,339
Still waiting for you to go back to take charge

249
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:08,641
Go home quickly

250
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:21,720
Go ahead

251
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:23,422
I'm fine

252
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,286
Princess Zhao

253
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,421
Please help yourself

254
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,158
I still have questions to ask about the rest.

255
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,094
Do not worry

256
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:12,504
where are we going

257
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,240
Secret Pavilion

258
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:35,461
How did it become like this?

259
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,164
Now the Secret Pavilion

260
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,300
There is no longer any six or seven fasts

261
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,369
I won't stay here again

262
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:44,570
Where did it move to?

263
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,604
Military camp outside the city

264
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,306
Born to fight

265
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:49,008
Why bother making it look like an academy?

266
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,576
My father's way of doing things

267
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:51,844
It should have been thrown away long ago

268
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:53,812
The current secret pavilion

269
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:55,381
There are no more teachers to teach

270
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:57,649
what's the function

271
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,818
Learning martial arts and combat skills is enough

272
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:01,987
If you don’t read, you don’t understand

273
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:02,588
How can I understand

274
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:03,722
The meaning of the Secret Pavilion

275
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,090
If you only know how to kill

276
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,358
But I don’t know how to be determined

277
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,293
Sooner or later your eyes will be covered with blood

278
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:09,862
soldier

279
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:12,164
Just obey military orders

280
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,466
So you don't understand at all

281
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:15,801
Why does Lu Zhangyuan

282
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:17,169
Choose a young man to enter the Secret Pavilion

283
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,306
battle of ideas

284
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:22,908
No need to waste words

285
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,703
The surrounding area has been fortified

286
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,338
No one is allowed to leave here

287
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:56,442
Why

288
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,610
First

289
00:17:58,844 --> 00:17:59,611
you have to

290
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,080
What Yuan Zhongxin said and did

291
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,181
Write it all down

292
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:03,682
I need to use it in my case

293
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:04,817
second

294
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:07,853
Xinmi Pavilion was established

295
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,054
You want to join

296
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:10,856
Still need to investigate

297
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,324
Can't you go home?

298
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,961
Please stay in this courtyard for a few more days.

299
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:17,529
The time has come

300
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:18,897
Nature will let you go

301
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:21,533
Is there anything else you want to say?

302
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:24,503
Do you have pen and paper?

303
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:27,940
Writing or painting

304
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,441
write memorial

305
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:30,776
What memorial

306
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:31,810
Impeach

307
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:32,678
Who to impeach

308
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:33,545
you

309
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:35,414
Impeach me for what?

310
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:36,849
Lu Zhangyuan died in battle

311
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:39,084
According to the ancestral system, you should live in mourning, Ding You

312
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:40,786
Three years of mourning at the grave

313
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,187
Impeach you for disregarding ethics and morality

314
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:43,622
Disobeying human ethics

315
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:47,493
He is indeed a scholar

316
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,462
I'll ask someone to bring the pen and paper later.

317
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:02,174
I'm going to get water

318
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,442
clean up here

319
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:05,811
Let's do it together

320
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:11,683
Yuan Family Affairs

321
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:13,452
not that simple

322
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:15,287
What

323
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:18,323
Lu Nanshan handle

324
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,691
Former Nakashin Oshiri Prison

325
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,627
Lock us here again

326
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:23,829
We should be waiting for someone to come find us.

327
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,598
who will come to us

328
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:29,067
have no idea

329
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,470
But this person

330
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:33,572
It should be related to the Yuan family

331
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,640
go in

332
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,013
This is waiting for me

333
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:37,703
I heard you have the means

334
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:39,738
Not pinned

335
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,739
I'm afraid you'll run away

336
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:50,616
What's your surname?

337
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:53,518
The compound surname is Yuchi

338
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,420
One source per name

339
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:56,989
Source of Origin

340
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:58,890
Members of the secret court

341
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:59,758
Secret Pavilion

342
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:00,826
Which day

343
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:04,730
Lu Nanshan’s New Secret Pavilion

344
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:06,965
This time I went to Yingtian Mansion to search for the Yuan family.

345
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:09,334
This is the team I lead

346
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,078
The Yuan family escaped but left a trap

347
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,015
Xiao Li's Knife

348
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,816
He was stabbed to death with a flying spear

349
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:28,920
Lao Gu

350
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:30,589
die from sting

351
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,526
We are a team of four

352
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,128
The strongest one is Xiao Zhao

353
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,096
he uses sword

354
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,399
This was cut off by a sharp blade

355
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,367
A swordsman wearing a hat

356
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:43,735
The knife is carried diagonally on the back

357
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,103
A knife is unsheathed

358
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:46,571
Cut off Xiao Zhao's sword

359
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,540
It also took away Xiao Zhao’s life

360
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,381
Aren’t the Yuan family all gone?

361
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:58,417
Why is there still someone left?

362
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,319
I don't think so

363
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,989
Someone behind the Yuan family is helping them

364
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:05,290
All are good hands

365
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,658
But the origin is unknown

366
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,961
This swordsman is one of them

367
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:12,297
Xixia people

368
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,901
Search the Yuan family this time

369
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:17,803
It's a top secret operation

370
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,237
We just arrived at Yingtianfu

371
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:20,238
The Yuan family is empty.

372
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:21,306
they moved away

373
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:22,641
Leave us to Yingtianfu

374
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:24,209
Only one day passed

375
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:26,078
Someone leaked the news

376
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:28,146
Someone in the court is helping the Yuan family

377
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:35,887
answer my question now

378
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:39,324
Who is helping the Yuan family?

379
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:41,860
I do not know

380
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:43,895
Who is that swordsman?

381
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,198
I very much support your revenge for your subordinates.

382
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,766
But I really don't know

383
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,768
Your father is the clan leader

384
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:50,969
Yuan Family Affairs

385
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:53,538
you do not know

386
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,173
I never called him daddy

387
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:01,646
give me answer

388
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:05,617
I really can't give it

389
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:12,491
For the Yuan family

390
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:14,860
How many people died?

391
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,469
I didn’t even listen to what dad said.

392
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:25,971
if you said

393
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,239
Everything is correct

394
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,174
Why do you need to teach me how to read?

395
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,777
Reading is for understanding

396
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,646
What understanding reason seeks is to be able to distinguish between right and wrong

397
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:38,216
Ah Jian Na

398
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:39,918
Dad asked you to get married

399
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,053
Dad won't harm you

400
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,022
If I listened to you today

401
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,224
Just get married like this

402
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:48,059
Is to put oneself

403
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,327
Hidden in the boudoir

404
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:51,863
That kind of me

405
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,299
How is it different from the dead?

406
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:57,102
father

407
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,138
I am leaving

408
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:02,407
I'm leaving today

409
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,510
It’s to seek the path in my heart

410
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:08,547
Everything in the world stops me

411
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,449
Undying

412
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:12,684
Unyielding

413
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,289
Just father-daughter love

414
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,858
never dare to forget

415
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:21,426
Take care of yourself

416
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:49,788
father

417
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:53,024
I'm home

418
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:03,869
How did you open the lock?

419
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:13,945
just kill me

420
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,547
People are dead

421
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:17,215
Just nothing

422
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,488
Why did you send everyone away?

423
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,157
Lu Nanshan didn't let you do anything to me

424
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:28,026
The Yuan family killed my colleagues

425
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,428
I shall take revenge

426
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:33,765
understand

427
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:34,900
goodbye

428
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:50,215
The subordinate just wanted to teach him a lesson

429
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,950
Well taught

430
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,852
No one has taught me a lesson

431
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:55,420
Dean

432
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:58,423
This subordinate will lead a search throughout the city.

433
00:25:58,857 --> 00:25:59,758
Kaifeng city is so big

434
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:00,926
Can you find it?

435
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:06,765
But in fact

436
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:08,900
Where Yuan Zhongxin can go

437
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,368
Not many

438
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:45,570
Lu Nanshan said

439
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,041
Talk about Xiao Jing’s family

440
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,810
I have been in contact with Han Duanzhang for a long time.

441
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,079
I do not know

442
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:56,982
impossible

443
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:58,149
Our family is disconnected from Han

444
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:59,284
It does not matter

445
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:04,322
Not in a hurry

446
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:05,590
Check slowly

447
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:10,528
Xiao Xue

448
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:12,731
Why are you saying it now?

449
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,403
Lu Nanshan issued a military order

450
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:20,972
Let me not tell you

451
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:23,375
Then why did you say it again?

452
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:28,346
Because I think you

453
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:31,650
More important than military orders

454
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,720
What's happening now

455
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:37,922
You can't check it from Lu Nanshan.

456
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:39,290
To check

457
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:41,426
We have to do it ourselves

458
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,361
But there are people watching around

459
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:44,429
can not go out

460
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:45,730
There's nothing we can do

461
00:27:58,143 --> 00:27:59,444
Coach Liang

462
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,620
what's the matter

463
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,721
Do you need my help

464
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,023
Coach Liang

465
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:12,891
how do you know

466
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:13,892
we are here

467
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:15,660
It's Zhao Jian

468
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:17,028
She found me

469
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,745
The chief looked for you before going home.

470
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:34,846
Zhao Jian said

471
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:36,014
You guys are in trouble

472
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,248
As expected of the chief

473
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,249
Thoughtful

474
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:39,918
Someone is guarding outside

475
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:40,919
how did you get in

476
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:41,519
I told them

477
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,288
Come and see your students

478
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:44,456
Just let me in

479
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:45,056
Say it

480
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:46,324
What trouble

481
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:47,525
Long story short

482
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:48,927
Yuan Zhongxin was arrested

483
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:50,061
You Qizhai

484
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,329
He is the sickest one.

485
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,164
Actively caught

486
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:54,566
Should have been caught long ago

487
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,167
Good catch

488
00:28:57,936 --> 00:28:59,370
Afraid of life and death

489
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,377
Is it that serious

490
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:11,683
What do you need me to do

491
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:12,450
We can't stay here

492
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,418
Equal results

493
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:14,686
our own business

494
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,387
We need to check it ourselves

495
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,126
When I came in just now

496
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:22,494
There are many guards outside

497
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:23,928
Fight out

498
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:25,697
Too much noise

499
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:26,564
No need to use your hands

500
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:28,566
Then what do you want me to do?

501
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:30,535
Today's date is just right

502
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,403
Just bring me a letter

503
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:33,972
Good date

504
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:35,840
A letter

505
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:03,301
You guys go down first

506
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:07,972
Princess, you

507
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:09,541
I want to be alone

508
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,975
Talk to my dad for a while

509
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:20,084
let's go

510
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:04,229
I suffered a lot when I was a child

511
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,133
I think I know something

512
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,401
The truth of this world

513
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,404
what truth

514
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:15,773
Just one person

515
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:18,843
As long as it's bad enough and ruthless enough

516
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:22,447
Don't care about anything

517
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:24,883
You'll live a pretty good life

518
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,252
It's not unreasonable

519
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:30,121
But such a person is like

520
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,490
Sinking underwater

521
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,895
Sinking to the deepest bottom of the water

522
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:39,998
So lonely

523
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:41,966
alone in the mud

524
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:43,701
Trek forward

525
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,005
Seems like he can't stand the injury

526
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:50,742
But it's hard to breathe

527
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:52,777
Hard to move even an inch

528
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:56,981
People shouldn't live alone

529
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:00,451
uncle

530
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:01,886
The first half of the road

531
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:03,321
It was you who accompanied Zhao Jian

532
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:05,490
second half of the road

533
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,460
I will accompany her until the end

534
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:14,766
Actually I didn't plan to

535
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:15,700
Ran out

536
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,603
But I am restless

537
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,606
I was just thinking

538
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:24,242
Maybe kneel here

539
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:25,710
Take these few words from your heart

540
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,078
Tell your uncle

541
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,415
He can also be at peace

542
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,420
Just to make my dad feel at ease

543
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:38,122
also for you

544
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:22,867
Everyone in charge is here

545
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:23,735
Let's go get someone

546
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,304
Liang Zhu went to see Wang Kuan

547
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:29,240
He also took a letter away with him

548
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,777
Who is Liang Zhu?

549
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:37,448
I used to teach boxing in Mi Pavilion

550
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:40,218
This is Wang Kuan’s secret move.

551
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:44,055
The troops are divided into two groups

552
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:45,723
I'm going to find Yuan Zhongxin

553
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:47,091
You follow Liang Zhu

554
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,629
I want them to understand

555
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,698
All their calculations

556
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:55,333
All in vain

557
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:01,339
what are you doing

558
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,207
Dean

559
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:05,176
I thought about it

560
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:06,544
Yuan Zhongxin escaped

561
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:08,346
It's my misfortune

562
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,948
I went to Buddhist temples and Taoist temples to worship.

563
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,317
This willow leaf sweeps the body

564
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:14,452
Can remove bad luck

565
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:17,855
Nonsense

566
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:19,457
You lost someone

567
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:20,458
What bad luck should I sweep away?

568
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,899
How can we forget the good thing about Zhang Yuan?

569
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:37,341
open the door open the door

570
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:38,509
Open the door quickly

571
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:39,177
open the door

572
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:40,845
Open the door quickly

573
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,216
There is a funeral in the courtyard

574
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,086
A funeral is no greater matter than a state affair

575
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:49,454
Then smash

576
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,622
Chasing the rebels

577
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:52,824
yes

578
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,175
Xiaolu Zhangyuan is such a coincidence

579
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,643
I just wanted to find you

580
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:14,345
Yuan Zhongxin escapes from the dungeon

581
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,647
May I ask where the county master is?

582
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:18,349
I know

583
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,818
I was about to hand someone over to you

584
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:27,859
meet again

585
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:29,527
Xiaolu Zhangyuan

586
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,297
He came to find you

587
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,732
He came to pay homage to my father

588
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,568
Then express your heart in front of the soul

589
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:39,403
It is to soothe the dead

590
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:40,705
It's also comforting me

591
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:42,206
Then what

592
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,441
I am very touched

593
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:45,643
Then tied him up

594
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,080
why

595
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,048
The origin of funeral etiquette is filial piety

596
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:52,950
How dare you let a fugitive

597
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,418
Disturbing the mourning hall

598
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:56,621
But he did it for you

599
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:57,655
The dead are the greatest

600
00:35:58,055 --> 00:35:59,023
How dare I let my late father

601
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:00,725
There is no peace under the Nine Springs

602
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:07,265
Take it away

603
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:09,867
The justice of the princess

604
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:11,569
I should also pay my respects

605
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:12,470
No need

606
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,744
what do you want to say

607
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:24,048
I miss him a little

608
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,886
I mean Yu Chiyuan

609
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:44,802
Pull over, pull over

610
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,284
Xiaolu Zhangyuan

611
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:01,786
Xiao Xue

612
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:03,387
Pour the tea quickly

613
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:05,089
where is tea

614
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,524
look

615
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:08,326
It's miserable for us here

616
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,461
What to write

617
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:11,862
Hold on

618
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:34,285
Memorial to your impeachment

619
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:35,620
Please hand it over

620
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:38,055
You really wrote it

621
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:39,690
I always do what I say

622
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:49,533
Yuan Zhongxin escaped

623
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:52,370
Fleeed to Zhao Mansion

624
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:55,339
Zhao Jian handed him back again

625
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:57,842
impossible

626
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:00,011
Anyway, the person has been escorted back to the dungeon

627
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:01,979
There is no chance of escape

628
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,682
I know you Qizhai

629
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:06,284
There is always some cleverness

630
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,019
Actually

631
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:09,887
Just a group

632
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:12,623
A young man who doesn't know his place

633
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:18,062
Dare I ask Mr. Lu?

634
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:20,698
How high the sky is, how thick the earth is

635
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:21,999
Do you have a real number?

636
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:25,136
It turned out that I didn’t know either

637
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:25,970
The sky is high and the earth is thick

638
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,573
I know Liang Zhu has been here

639
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:30,441
so what

640
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:31,742
Wang Kuan

641
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:33,277
do you know

642
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:34,645
All your means

643
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:36,647
I can guess it

644
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:37,548
Really

645
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,098
Go find out whose mansion this is

646
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:54,799
yes

647
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,638
You asked Liang Zhu to leave with the letter

648
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:02,840
Just want to take the opportunity to escape from here

649
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,408
Help Yuan Zhongxin investigate the case

650
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:07,244
Guessed right

651
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:09,613
But the Yuan family is in a lot of trouble

652
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:13,084
I checked that he has a Privy Council Order

653
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:14,652
You feel

654
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,520
What kind of person

655
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:19,290
To break today's situation

656
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,958
Not many people like this

657
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:22,727
Asked clearly

658
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,095
It's a mansion bought by a tea merchant.

659
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:27,998
There are many official residences around here.

660
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:29,333
Tea merchants will buy it here

661
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:30,501
I heard that I bought a petty official

662
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:31,969
It seems to be the son of the city

663
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:33,003
Or the coach

664
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:34,205
Sesame Mung Bean Big Posts

665
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,573
In fact, he is just a petty official.

666
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:37,007
Sure

667
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:37,808
I asked many people

668
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:38,642
can't be wrong

669
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:50,688
Deputy Purpose of the Privy Council

670
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:52,289
Acting under Lu Nanshan

671
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:54,258
able to disobey

672
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:56,494
There are not many people with military orders in the Privy Council.

673
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,296
But by your side Wang Kuan

674
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:00,164
But there is one

675
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,199
Can change today's situation

676
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:06,303
Let your distinguished officials pay homage to the government affairs

677
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:07,838
It can be called the name of Xianggong

678
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:09,774
You turn to him for help

679
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:11,976
This is your plan, right?

680
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:15,479
I am Lu Nan

681
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,348
I am Lu Nanshan

682
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:18,849
I'm Lu Nan Shantou

683
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,584
me

684
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:21,585
me

685
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:24,655
me

686
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:34,298
I

687
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:36,767
I'm Lu Nanshan's subordinate

688
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:38,002
I am Lu Nan

689
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:39,570
I am Lu Nan

690
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:40,571
I

691
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:41,972
I

692
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:47,044
me

693
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:58,823
I

694
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:03,461
me

695
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:04,495
Well played

696
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:05,463
beat

697
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,298
Well played

698
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:08,532
beat

699
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:19,443
Lu Zhangyuan had expected it

700
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:20,277
Variables here

701
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:24,215
I dare to ask, but it will be in front of Wang Xianggong

702
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:26,884
Lu Nanshan, deputy commissioner of the Privy Council

703
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:28,819
Let us pay our respects to Mr.

704
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:42,666
See Wang Xianggong

705
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:44,902
His Majesty is in a high position

706
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:45,402
He said something

707
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:47,171
Of course I'll let him go.

708
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:47,805
But Wang Kuan

709
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:49,340
have you ever thought about

710
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:51,408
You are the royal son.

711
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,544
I lock you here

712
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:55,346
Wouldn’t your father know?

713
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:58,883
The story behind Qizhai

714
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:01,519
Am I really the only one like me?

715
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,454
A small new courtyard?

716
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:06,690
to be honest

717
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:08,359
lock you here

718
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,894
This is exactly what your father meant.

719
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:12,296
You also wrote to him

720
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:15,299
such a pity

721
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,468
All your efforts were wasted

722
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:23,307
no way no money

723
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,910
How to be so calm

724
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,344
have to say

725
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:29,280
Your qi-nurturing efforts

726
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,048
I really admire

727
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:35,019
I've thought about it

728
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:36,820
What

729
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:38,422
I'm locked up here

730
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:39,790
My father should know

731
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,725
Of course I've thought about such a thing

732
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:43,127
so

733
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:44,828
put all one's eggs in one basket

734
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:46,030
take a gamble

735
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,298
Now that I've thought about it

736
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:48,732
That would ruin the situation.

737
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,100
I can't rely on my father

738
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,203
Not relying on your father

739
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,706
Then the big shot in the court

740
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:57,575
Who else can you ask?

741
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:00,611
I didn't invite

742
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:02,680
Just asking for directions

743
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:05,449
so

744
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,985
Liang Zhu is the stone you threw

745
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:10,621
How can he find a way out?

746
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:11,488
No

747
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:13,557
Your men

748
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:16,126
It's the stone that's thrown
