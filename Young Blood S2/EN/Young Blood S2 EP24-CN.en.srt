1
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:49,109
Brother Wang, you are awake.

2
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,878
I was rescued by you

3
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:14,467
do not Cry

4
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:17,370
I

5
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,682
I don't actually feel pain

6
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,223
How could it not hurt?

7
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,058
you know too

8
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:41,060
my life

9
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,428
never lie

10
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:45,398
I'm a very stubborn person

11
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,600
How could I break myself?

12
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,968
Bottom line and persistence

13
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,438
So you believe me, Xiao Jing

14
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:54,841
I am okay

15
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:56,743
I don't feel any pain

16
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:12,625
Wang Kuan

17
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:18,164
Wang Kuan

18
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:20,366
you're awake

19
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:38,551
what do you mean

20
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,687
I'm thinking of advising you again

21
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,089
Do you still want to persuade me to leave?

22
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:44,490
alive

23
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:47,160
Anything is possible

24
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,628
People donâ€™t live just to live

25
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:49,896
you are wrong

26
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:52,265
People start from birth

27
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,866
Just struggle to survive

28
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,568
Just survive

29
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,503
To prove that you are still there

30
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,405
after death

31
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,275
The so-called persistence of faith

32
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,043
All in vain

33
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:05,678
But it is precisely because there is

34
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,680
Thousands of beliefs and perseverance

35
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,982
Changed the world

36
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:10,149
If not

37
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:11,284
From ancient times to the present

38
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,019
The world is still a pool of stagnant water

39
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:16,689
you are all crazy

40
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:17,790
maybe

41
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,026
They're crazy and you're with them

42
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,761
Do you care?

43
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:22,662
you

44
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,897
different from them

45
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:25,898
What

46
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,668
You are different from the others in Qizhai

47
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:30,403
Not a fellow traveler

48
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,138
You're doing this to me again, right?

49
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,806
Xianbei bloodline, right?

50
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,777
The one inside woke up

51
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:43,383
rest assured

52
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,153
I'm watching for you outside

53
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:50,156
If your father wants to take action

54
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:51,057
Already moved

55
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,793
The little girl is sensible

56
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,646
I heard your father is outside

57
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:15,882
We quarreled again

58
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:17,383
It's time

59
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:18,751
You still have time to take care of this matter?

60
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:20,386
Don't use this expression

61
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:22,922
Didn't I agree before coming here?

62
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:24,657
Regardless of life or death

63
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:26,926
Besides, I'm not dead either

64
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:30,763
How is he injured?

65
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:34,767
Just save your life temporarily

66
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,737
He just comforted me and said

67
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:38,638
He doesn't feel any pain

68
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:44,877
Not a comfort

69
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:46,746
It's true

70
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:48,948
You treated it well.

71
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:50,750
I'm all right

72
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,223
I'm going to ask Hua Cishu

73
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:59,625
Let him arrange for you to evacuate here

74
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:02,395
where to

75
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:03,629
Return to Song Dynasty

76
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,465
I think it's OK

77
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:07,500
Let Wang Kuan go back to recuperate first

78
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:10,336
No

79
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,271
Don't be brave anymore

80
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:13,740
you are hurt too badly

81
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:16,242
My injury

82
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,511
I'm afraid I can't stand running thousands of miles

83
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:22,882
Better to stay first

84
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,485
Always helpful with suggestions

85
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:26,886
Forget it, forget it.

86
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,721
You stay.

87
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:31,157
This guy is very strong

88
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:32,058
what did you tell him

89
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:32,992
He won't listen

90
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,061
My temper is okay

91
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:36,963
It's not like I don't know you

92
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,365
I'm going to make another medicine

93
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,067
Don't be too tired

94
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:43,903
I know

95
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,823
Don't you lie?

96
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:08,027
No pain

97
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,300
she cried

98
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,702
Been holding on to it all my life

99
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:23,309
I will avenge you

100
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:24,377
I will definitely give it to you

101
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:25,445
Kill Yuan Hao

102
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:29,682
Can't

103
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,717
Letâ€™s kill Yuan Hao

104
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:33,085
It is to eliminate the war

105
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:34,954
It can't be for personal vendetta

106
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,222
You are like this

107
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,228
I said it all

108
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:44,797
I'm a very stubborn person

109
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,601
Don't cry and look sad, either

110
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:50,203
Affect my mood

111
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:54,240
I am in a bad mood

112
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:56,209
How to heal

113
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,078
Do you want me to do this at this time?

114
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,580
Do you still smile at you?

115
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:02,682
Tell me about it

116
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,084
What is the current situation?

117
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:15,962
No hidden lies

118
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,196
Join forces with Brother Ning Ling again

119
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:19,699
Brother Ning Ling still dares to believe him?

120
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,601
Yuan Hao will be getting married in a few days

121
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,669
The bride is from the Meiyi clan

122
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,538
I was engaged to Brother Ning Ling before.

123
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,441
There is no hidden false suggestion

124
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,177
On his wedding day

125
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,078
replace the bride

126
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,346
Assassination on the spot

127
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:37,583
How to change the bride?

128
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:38,951
Arranged by Ning Lingge

129
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,821
Who should I replace it with?

130
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,222
Who will do it

131
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:44,957
I

132
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:47,760
Too dangerous

133
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:48,761
yes

134
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:50,196
Isn't this a dead end?

135
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,034
There's someone hanging over Yuan Hao's side.

136
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:56,435
what

137
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:10,583
This is the Yuan clan

138
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,584
hung on a shelf

139
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,586
I saw someone hanging on the shelf

140
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:14,987
I'll report it as soon as possible.

141
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,589
You're looking for me

142
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:17,823
gentlemen

143
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:23,062
You just sit here like this

144
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,967
Do I still have to rush over?

145
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:30,503
Yuan clan members

146
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,837
With a patriarch like you

147
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,307
It can be said that the whole family is unlucky.

148
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:35,741
People

149
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,979
You have to live for yourself

150
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,586
Not all the people hanging here are members of the Yuan clan.

151
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,421
Who else

152
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,103
Sorry, Mr. Wei

153
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:06,238
Qing Tianzi

154
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,341
What do you mean by this?

155
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,476
This is not about your son

156
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:11,577
Please come out?

157
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,479
You are father and son after all

158
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:15,881
Failed assassination attempt at banquet

159
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,718
I'm afraid they have escaped long ago

160
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:21,721
It's possible

161
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:23,322
But what if

162
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,224
Gotta try it

163
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,993
Show your sincerity

164
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,204
This knife cut a little deep

165
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,139
If this doesn't stop bleeding

166
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,742
Mr. Wei, I'm afraid

167
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:43,976
Can't make it through the night

168
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:47,580
But don't worry

169
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,281
I think

170
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:50,816
Your son will definitely come

171
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:53,953
His character is pretty good

172
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,322
them

173
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,991
He really ran away.

174
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,526
Then you'd have died in vain.

175
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,961
Qing Tianzi

176
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,063
You act this way

177
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,365
How to win people's hearts

178
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,368
If you really die

179
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,104
I will definitely follow the etiquette of the Song Dynasty

180
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,005
Bury you with honor

181
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,142
The first seven days

182
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,444
I can definitely cry my eyes out

183
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:20,479
No need

184
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,581
I can't bear it

185
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:26,152
I have to save him

186
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:27,953
Isn't this nonsense? Let's go

187
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:28,988
I'll go alone

188
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,190
Go alone, you're crazy

189
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,857
Xiao Xue

190
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:33,125
listen to me

191
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,261
My dad told me

192
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:37,463
His taking refuge in Xixia was a bitter trick

193
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,764
He is not treasonous

194
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:41,801
after i leave

195
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:43,235
You leave here immediately

196
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:44,704
Find a hiding place again

197
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,039
I'm afraid I can't stand it

198
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,642
I'm afraid I won't be able to withstand the torture

199
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:51,077
As long as I don't know

200
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:51,744
where are you

201
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,279
The secret will not be leaked

202
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,313
What did you say

203
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:57,950
Chu Niao died in front of my eyes

204
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,885
Wen Wuqi followed the crane into the fire

205
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:01,921
Both of them were dead

206
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:03,089
I ask you

207
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,957
Wen Wuqi went to rob Chu Niaoshi

208
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:06,459
Why didn't I call you?

209
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:07,960
why did he go alone

210
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,961
Because he assassinated

211
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:09,995
Yuan Hao's mission

212
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:11,764
entrusted to us

213
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,235
I'm going to do what I have to do now

214
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,237
The hope of killing Yuan Hao

215
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:19,805
Entrusted to you

216
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:23,909
help me take revenge

217
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:29,949
Let him go alone

218
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:31,183
I am the chief

219
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,219
It's not his turn to give orders

220
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:35,888
We can't leave the office alone

221
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:36,789
face all this

222
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:37,723
That's natural

223
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,158
Xiaojing, guard Wang Kuan

224
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:42,128
gentlemen

225
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:43,395
what should we do

226
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:46,999
what would you do

227
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:48,801
not my business

228
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,224
Yanei

229
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:13,425
Didnâ€™t we all agree?

230
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:14,727
What do you want to do?

231
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,628
who is the chief

232
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:16,629
you

233
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,696
Then stop talking nonsense

234
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:19,498
Don't take action

235
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,433
With Yuan Hao

236
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:22,468
No one can escape

237
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,236
I want to save people.

238
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:28,707
Say it

239
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:30,309
What conditions are required?

240
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,377
You are willing to take action

241
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,448
if i was hung there

242
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,552
I wouldn't want him to show up

243
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:40,786
if you were hung there

244
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:41,921
Definitely not going to show up in Yanei

245
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:42,521
And you

246
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:44,523
will you come

247
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:46,859
I didn't think about it

248
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:55,434
All stay here

249
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,469
Don't come over and cause trouble

250
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:58,237
Mr. Yuan

251
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,142
I owe you a life

252
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,380
What did you say just now?

253
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,749
I take action

254
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,685
What conditions are required?

255
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,021
No conditions

256
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,560
what's the situation

257
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,697
Do you want to repair the relationship with you?

258
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:02,234
Mr. Wei

259
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:03,235
did you see it

260
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,536
Yuantian Pass is coming

261
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,206
To cast oneself into a trap for the sake of oneâ€™s own people

262
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,540
I didn't expect this

263
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,276
Still a little bit human

264
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,511
I was wrong.

265
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:14,713
superior

266
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,205
father

267
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:50,809
Yanei

268
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:52,711
Yanei

269
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:54,046
Calm inside the office

270
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,347
Yanei

271
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:18,604
kill him

272
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,787
What's going on?

273
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,755
Yuchi is here too

274
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,825
Mr. Yuchi will help you

275
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:01,847
All lives are gone

276
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:03,248
What are you laughing at?

277
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:13,659
Pity

278
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:18,030
Bury it

279
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,498
Remember to give a generous burial

280
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:20,566
I promised him

281
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:42,821
Yanei

282
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:43,589
Yanei

283
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:44,623
Yanei

284
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:47,726
calm

285
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:49,528
let me go

286
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,163
let me go

287
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,936
Why did he kill my father?

288
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:05,244
Yanei Yanei

289
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:06,912
Yanei Yanei

290
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,046
Yanei

291
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,185
Dad believes in you

292
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:15,220
Good

293
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:17,189
grown up

294
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:37,943
My dad said

295
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,380
He believes in me

296
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:44,249
I grew up

297
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,718
So I won't rush out

298
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:50,789
I want him to see

299
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,061
He didn't believe his son wrongly

300
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:07,472
come up

301
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:16,582
gone

302
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:18,217
I want to live

303
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:20,752
Live to avenge my father

304
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,563
I have no idea

305
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:39,638
I do not know why

306
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,073
why did he kill him

307
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:58,924
Shiboâ€™s life and death still need to be confirmed

308
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:00,225
Nothing to confirm

309
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:00,993
Dead

310
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:05,831
why did you kill him

311
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:07,766
You risked your life to come to Xixia

312
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,835
Donâ€™t you just consider yourself a member of Qizhai?

313
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,071
I am

314
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:14,306
Say it again

315
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:15,741
you

316
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,743
different from them

317
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:19,911
Look at Wei Zhuoran

318
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:21,913
Eighty percent of it is a secret line from the Song Dynasty

319
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:23,081
Serve the country wholeheartedly

320
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,151
Not to mention the Zhao family

321
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:27,519
royal blood

322
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,554
Xue Yingâ€™s father was a military householder

323
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:30,555
Destiny to guard the territory

324
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,591
Wang Kuan is a member of a famous family

325
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:34,393
Although Pei Jing is a foreigner

326
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:35,961
But he has a grudge against Liao State

327
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:37,462
Pei family surrenders to Song Dynasty

328
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,031
It's also natural

329
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,166
what do you want to say in the end

330
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,401
They kill thieves for the country

331
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:43,068
Emphasis on love and justice

332
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,870
That's how we were born

333
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:47,139
Family history and bloodline inheritance

334
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,107
A real story

335
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:51,376
And you

336
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:52,577
Yuan Zhongxin

337
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:54,780
You are rotten from the root

338
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,116
With a dad like me

339
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,719
You have nothing to pass on

340
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,823
You know it yourself

341
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,058
so

342
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,593
You follow them and risk your life

343
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:09,761
Isn't this stupid?

344
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:11,830
They have heritage and foundation

345
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:13,899
and I

346
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,102
A selfish little person

347
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,238
Why are you joining in the fun with them?

348
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,141
Wake up, Yuan Zhongxin

349
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:26,078
You are not the same type of person as them

350
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,746
I'm a bad person

351
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,649
My son should be born like this

352
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,318
How sad!

353
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:37,289
That's how things are.

354
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:39,124
Lao Tzu enters the prison camp

355
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:40,158
My son was called a thief

356
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:42,227
You should have seen this kind of thing too often

357
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:44,830
He grew up with fine clothes and good food

358
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,765
You're crawling in the mud

359
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,800
Born in the mire

360
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:50,769
All are corrupt things

361
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,472
Actually I'm fine

362
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:54,906
Taking care of your feelings

363
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:56,508
Logically speaking

364
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:57,843
I'll kill you directly

365
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,277
Just these friends

366
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:00,779
it's good now

367
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,881
I kill Wei Zhuoran

368
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:05,016
There is a gap between you and Qizhai.

369
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,688
Just find a step and escape completely

370
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:12,190
Yuan Zhongxin

371
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,160
A choice you can't make

372
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:16,862
I'll do it for you

373
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:18,597
This situation now

374
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,632
You guys can't do it either.

375
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,568
Letâ€™s part ways and go back to the Song Dynasty as soon as possible.

376
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:31,009
You can go together

377
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:34,780
No need

378
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,981
Are you going to persuade him?

379
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:37,682
it's useless

380
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,819
He has a father like me

381
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:42,888
It's destiny

382
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:43,822
I don't advise him

383
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:46,825
real

384
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,260
Yuan Zhongxinâ€™s decision

385
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,395
No one needs to persuade him

386
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:51,296
you're right

387
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:58,870
I have neither

388
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:00,605
Family inheritance

389
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:01,239
nor

390
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:02,240
Loyalty of fathers

391
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,278
I'm different from them

392
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:11,817
I really want to understand

393
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:13,585
Figured it out

394
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:18,423
Just figure it out

395
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,859
Everything must have a beginning

396
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:25,764
Since I have no inheritance

397
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:28,834
Then letâ€™s start the inheritance from me

398
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:30,268
Since there is no door tradition

399
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:32,504
That Yuan family tradition started from myself

400
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,041
i want you to know

401
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:39,744
In the abyss and mire

402
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:42,547
It can also produce flowers

403
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,597
Let me see how you face Wei Yuan

404
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:25,757
What happened in Yanei?

405
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,159
My uncle was murdered

406
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:30,462
It's Yuan Hao

407
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,164
Yuan Tianguan's moving hand

408
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:37,469
How could it be Yuantian Pass?

409
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:40,438
I also want to know

410
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:46,511
I gonna go see

411
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:38,630
How did you get hurt like this?

412
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:40,298
Is Pei Jing here?

413
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:42,500
i want to see her

414
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:49,474
His Excellency Dragon Dragon God

415
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:52,077
do not move

416
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,578
Let me help you treat your wounds first

417
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:55,313
Xue Ying helped me pack the
medicine

418
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:02,153
His Excellency Dragon God

419
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,558
You use your magic

420
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:08,460
my injury

421
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:12,397
Will it be fine in a moment?

422
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,343
Can't I use my magic power?

423
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:29,881
cannot

424
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:34,552
I know

425
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:38,089
Western Xia territory

426
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,858
They are all local gods

427
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,829
Mana cannot be tampered with

428
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,504
How did you get hurt like this?

429
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:56,074
I saved Mr. Yuan

430
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,113
Small Scene

431
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:08,687
You feel

432
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:11,523
Is what my father said true?

433
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:12,824
What did uncle say?

434
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:16,227
It was he who came to Xixia

435
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,663
It's actually a trick

436
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,032
I think it's true

437
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:27,706
That

438
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:29,674
when he died

439
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:32,077
Is he a hero?

440
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,179
Of course it counts

441
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:38,183
That's good

442
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:42,387
I said it a long time ago

443
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:46,925
My dad is number one in the world

444
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:00,271
But I can't even collect his body

445
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:05,977
Wang Kuan

446
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,118
Why is this world

447
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,287
It is always the hero who suffers the most

448
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:24,195
cry it out

449
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:27,265
no

450
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:30,602
I can't embarrass him

451
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:34,038
I can't cry

452
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:40,478
I can't cry

453
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:55,794
Yuan Zhongxin

454
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,597
Have you seen Mr. Yuan?

455
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:01,232
tell me quickly

456
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:03,001
Did he escape?

457
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:06,337
You blocked the pursuers for him

458
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:12,577
he's fine

459
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:20,118
That's great

460
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:22,187
Very good

461
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,957
He left you, you don't hate him

462
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,595
I am Yuchiyuan

463
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,797
Mr. Changyuan's life

464
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:35,800
Not a loss

465
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:39,604
Moreover

466
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:42,674
Am I not dead yet?

467
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:47,045
It surprised me that

468
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,515
I actually killed him

469
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,285
Also saved a life

470
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,524
Am I strong or not?

471
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:16,207
What did he do for you?

472
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,609
Make you willing to die for him

473
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,245
For Mr. Yuan

474
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,114
Haven't done anything

475
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:25,750
for me

476
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,585
A great favor

477
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:36,227
I was born in the army

478
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,129
Military household

479
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,098
Poor life

480
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:42,567
When I first joined the army

481
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,136
The military leader doesn't like me

482
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:48,072
Withheld military pay

483
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:50,208
Want to take the blame on me

484
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:54,879
I thought I was dead

485
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:58,049
It was Mr. Yuan who saved me.

486
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,586
and took me under his command

487
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,356
He's trying to take advantage of you

488
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,265
Can be used by Mr. Yuan

489
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,067
Is it not good

490
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,043
dragon dragon god

491
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:27,478
Dragon God

492
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:39,357
How is Yanei?

493
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,226
Wang Kuan is with me

494
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:44,228
Where is the chief?

495
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:46,998
Miss Zhao

496
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:48,800
Miss Zhao, this is the palace.

497
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,702
We're still planning an assassination

498
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:52,537
Just stop running around

499
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:53,905
In case someone discovers

500
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,106
We all have to die

501
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:57,909
Do you need some medicine?

502
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:59,043
I said it all

503
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:01,179
I'll send it over in person later

504
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,582
I heard they want me to pretend to be the bride

505
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,018
Assassination of Yuan Hao

506
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,519
You can't do it forcefully

507
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:09,153
Can

508
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:12,223
Miss Zhao understands justice well

509
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:13,858
I want Wei Zhuoran's body

510
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:15,159
What

511
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:18,329
Miss Zhao

512
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:19,397
Calm down first

513
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:22,066
The reason why Yuan Hao buried Wei Zhuoran generously

514
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,267
Send someone to guard the tomb

515
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:24,602
I just guessed Wei Yuan

516
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:25,670
Go to worship before the meeting

517
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:27,138
There's really no way around it

518
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:27,939
good

519
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,441
Then don't assassinate

520
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:31,442
Miss Zhao

521
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,579
Yuan Hao prepared his troops vigorously

522
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,647
We will send troops again within a few years

523
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:37,949
This person can't stay.

524
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:39,584
This is justice

525
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,220
Never do it because of personal selfishness

526
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,521
Shake the righteousness

527
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,689
Do you want some face?

528
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,858
I also want Wang Kuanâ€™s arm

529
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:49,193
I really can't do it

530
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:50,595
We think of something

531
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:56,701
There's no reason to talk about righteousness

532
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,369
Just let others suffer

533
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:00,004
Miss Zhao's assassination

534
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:01,472
It's going to blow your head off

535
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:03,307
Let's help with something

536
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:04,709
as a matter of course

537
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:07,145
OK

538
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:09,147
saw the body

539
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:10,581
I'm the bride

540
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:13,584
Prime Minister as soon as possible

541
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:15,720
do you mean

542
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:17,922
Your father killed my father

543
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:19,524
Essentially

544
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:21,025
Itâ€™s to get you to leave Qizhai

545
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:23,461
He doesn't want his bloodline to be cut off

546
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:27,165
Then why should my father die?

547
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:29,367
Your father doesn't deserve to die

548
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:31,769
He is dead

549
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:35,239
Zhao Jian went to find Zang Pang.

550
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,042
She will help you find it

551
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:38,976
your father's body

552
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:54,425
do what

553
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:57,261
I swear to God

554
00:34:58,362 --> 00:34:59,430
What Yuan Tianguan did

555
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,598
I didn't know beforehand

556
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,868
But after all, there is such a relationship

557
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:05,470
Yanei

558
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,672
if you are angry

559
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:09,640
Take my revenge

560
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:19,917
What are you doing for revenge?

561
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:22,520
It's not you who did it.

562
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:26,557
what are you doing

563
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:29,627
this life

564
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:31,129
I owe you

565
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:32,597
If you want to take

566
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:33,598
can be taken away at any time

567
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:35,399
stand up

568
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:39,003
You get up first

569
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:44,942
Get up

570
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,179
I don't want your life

571
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:51,482
I want to kill

572
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:53,751
It's Yuantianguan

573
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:06,364
Yanei

574
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:08,566
where to

575
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,602
Feeling depressed

576
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:13,271
Go out and sit

577
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:15,339
I'll go with you.

578
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:17,608
No

579
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:19,510
I want to be alone for a while

580
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,754
Xue Ying

581
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:31,589
Help press

582
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:34,859
Too much blood loss

583
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:36,427
Can it still be saved?

584
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:40,064
you promised me

585
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:42,033
grant me eternal life

586
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,337
I'll keep your soul

587
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:48,406
Back to Song Dynasty

588
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:51,075
I will give you eternal life

589
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,682
Thank you Dragon God

590
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,219
And there's more

591
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:03,020
I my that

592
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,021
Gong

593
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:05,656
Praying for a child

594
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:08,125
Iâ€™d rather trouble the Dragon God to worry about it.

595
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:08,926
he is

596
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:10,928
His name is Yuan Tianguan

597
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:11,963
yuantianguan

598
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:13,364
Itâ€™s come to this point

599
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:15,066
Are you still thinking about this?

600
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,702
Mr. Yuan

601
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,805
Mr. Yuan must not have expected

602
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:22,640
I'll be seriously injured

603
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:26,277
Fortunately, the Dragon God is here

604
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:29,146
Otherwise I'll really die

605
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:31,282
Mr. Yuan

606
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:34,719
I will also feel sad and blame myself

607
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:38,689
what you do

608
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:43,794
I want to kowtow to the Dragon God

609
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:46,464
have you ever thought about

610
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,674
will i

611
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:58,976
Not the Dragon God

612
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:13,024
Of course I thought about it

613
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:14,859
just in case

614
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:15,860
Both

615
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,728
What should I do if he lied to me?

616
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:24,702
Figured it out

617
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:26,070
I can't figure it out

618
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:28,406
forget about it

619
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:34,679
forget about it

620
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:38,082
Why

621
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:41,419
this world

622
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,587
Not good for me

623
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:49,727
In addition to Mr. Yuan

624
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:53,597
no one needs me

625
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:09,780
Believe in the protection of the dragon god

626
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:15,586
I'm not so scared anymore

627
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:19,623
Mr. Yuan is in danger

628
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:21,792
I also

629
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:23,361
Dare to stand up

630
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:33,337
you have to be real

631
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,078
Otherwise I can't bear it

632
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:43,481
Can't stand it

633
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,122
Except Dragon God

634
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,124
I have nothing to rely on

635
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,064
this world

636
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,299
Not good for me

637
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:16,914
Dragon God's Protection

638
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:20,351
How lucky I am

639
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:17,908
You know me

640
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:19,710
What do you hate most about gods?

641
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:26,917
Blind believer

642
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:29,420
hope for everything

643
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:31,088
Entrust external things

644
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:34,225
But always forget

645
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:37,962
The one who crosses the world

646
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:41,866
Only people

647
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,236
Maybe they are just afraid

648
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:47,805
no support

649
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,875
Facing the world on their own

650
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:53,978
Too weak

651
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:55,079
so

652
00:41:57,381 --> 00:42:00,217
Courage is the rarest thing

653
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,061
By order of the Blue Emperor

654
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:13,230
I asked Wei Zhuoran

655
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,965
People familiar with Yuan Tianguan

656
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:17,601
All returns are gathered here

657
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:18,969
I'm too lazy to look

658
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:20,337
Just tell me the result

659
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:21,872
Wei Zhuoran and Yuan Tianguan

660
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,140
After each surrendered

661
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,075
have no contact with each other

662
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,745
Everyone has asked

663
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:29,079
indeed

664
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:30,180
These two people

665
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,715
Almost never spoke

666
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:35,185
Then this is ridiculous

667
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:37,888
Leave it at Yuantian Pass

668
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,590
I donâ€™t care about my family members

669
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,458
Take the risk to kill Wei Zhuoran

670
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,994
Then where did this killing come from?

671
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:47,364
Perhaps these two people were together during the Song Dynasty

672
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:48,399
There is hatred

673
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:52,236
Even if he doesn't take action

674
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:54,338
Wei Zhuoran will die as well

675
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:56,273
Why risk revenge?

676
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:58,075
Too

677
00:42:58,275 --> 00:43:00,744
Wei Zhuoran was laughing when he died

678
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:04,181
This smile

679
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:05,583
I really don't understand

680
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:08,686
I thought about it.

681
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:10,588
Yuan Tianguan ignores

682
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,222
The life and death of the Yuan clan

683
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:13,123
Logically speaking

684
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,225
The Yuan clan should hate him

685
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,661
That's the truth

686
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:19,263
That's better

687
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:21,365
Save the Yuan clan

688
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:23,467
They should be better than us

689
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:24,902
I want to kill Yuan Tianguan even more

690
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:26,103
Also for Qingtianzi

691
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,339
Leave a name for cherishing talents

692
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:36,447
Good

693
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:38,282
Let go of that

694
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,583
Let the Prime Minister arrange it

695
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:40,484
yes

696
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:44,154
I have another plan

697
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:46,190
I don't know if it's feasible

698
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:46,957
explain

699
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:50,394
Even if Wei Zhuoran is dead

700
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:52,496
Can also be used as bait

701
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:54,632
People in the Song Dynasty paid great attention to matters after death

702
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:55,499
Not as good as

703
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,034
Take Wei Zhuoran's body

704
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:58,068
Leave it to Wei Chen

705
00:43:58,168 --> 00:43:59,303
Carefully arranged

706
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,205
Force his son to show up

707
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:25,496
Prime Minister

708
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:27,064
Things about Wei Zhuoran

709
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:28,232
let me think again

710
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,034
yes

711
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:32,503
I'll take my leave first.

712
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:38,075
We're getting married in a few days

713
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,543
Serve some snacks

714
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:40,678
I understand

715
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:41,545
Go ahead
