1
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:56,549
Prime Minister

2
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,318
Things about Wei Zhuoran

3
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,519
let me think again

4
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:01,187
yes

5
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,523
I'll take my leave first.

6
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,062
We're getting married in a few days

7
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:10,463
Serve some snacks

8
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:11,564
I understand

9
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:12,432
Go ahead

10
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,004
Just one step away

11
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:19,172
You've got the body

12
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,208
Why did you change your mind again?

13
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:23,610
God knows he heard it again

14
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,477
what news

15
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,579
I can't snatch the body by force

16
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,118
Don't panic

17
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,787
At least you saved the Yuan family.

18
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:36,589
There is an explanation

19
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:41,628
The Yuan family was saved

20
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,129
But the Wei family

21
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:44,697
My father is dead

22
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,400
It's really urgent.

23
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:48,668
Something bad happened

24
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,170
What should I do?

25
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,140
yes

26
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:56,309
Revenge for killing father

27
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:58,478
Irreconcilable

28
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:19,399
You show up on your own initiative

29
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,601
Is there anything you want to tell me?

30
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,574
I'm only talking to you

31
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,909
You all go down

32
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:31,945
yes

33
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:40,587
alright

34
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:42,188
There are only two of us left

35
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,257
Have something to say?

36
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:49,629
I want my father's body

37
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,100
what would you like

38
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,368
unimportant

39
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,804
your father's body

40
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,239
Not important

41
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,574
Important

42
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,442
I

43
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,143
what to get

44
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:05,678
I'll cooperate with you

45
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,414
Take your companions

46
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,415
Leave it to me

47
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:10,216
No

48
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:12,252
Qizhai Tongxin

49
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,120
I will never betray my companions

50
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,256
Then why are you cooperating with me?

51
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:18,658
I want to kill Yuan Tianguan

52
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:21,628
Don't you want to

53
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:25,531
You have to cooperate with me to kill Yuan Tianguan

54
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,533
Revenge for killing father

55
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:28,935
How can you not repay it?

56
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,203
Makes sense

57
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,142
You Song people are really

58
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:37,477
So interesting

59
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:39,812
Your father's death

60
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,414
I also have a responsibility

61
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,016
Still want to cooperate with me

62
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,387
Kill the first culprit first

63
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,023
As for you

64
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:52,558
I won't let it go either

65
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,128
Good

66
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:56,929
Then you know

67
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,331
Where is Yuantianguan?

68
00:04:58,898 --> 00:04:59,532
have no idea

69
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:02,568
But you can force him out

70
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:05,972
his weakness

71
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:08,408
It's his son's life

72
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,109
Yuan Zhongxin

73
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,045
As long as you set a trap

74
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,547
Put a few of us in dire straits

75
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,283
Yuantianguan must take action

76
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,185
Didn't you just say that?

77
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:20,853
Won't you betray your companions?

78
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:23,222
you have to promise me

79
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,025
Only kill Yuantianguan

80
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:27,560
Don't move them

81
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,762
I can promise you

82
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,564
Can you believe it?

83
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,299
That's my thing

84
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:35,168
good

85
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:39,238
Tell me about it

86
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:42,141
How do you want to set a trap?

87
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:43,576
How to force them out?

88
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,545
Wang Kuan’s broken arm

89
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:46,946
still there

90
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:50,316
Body hair and skin

91
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,718
Received from parents

92
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,387
Don't dare to damage

93
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:55,788
Takayuki

94
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,525
The most taboo thing in life

95
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:01,761
Just dead without a whole body

96
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,297
use this arm

97
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,200
You can fish people out

98
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:16,776
Kid

99
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,445
you mean it

100
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,548
Revenge for killing my father

101
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,141
Condolences to Mr. Wei

102
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:24,410
Where is my father's body?

103
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:25,845
I'm thinking of a solution

104
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,421
Excellent wound medicine

105
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:36,856
Prince Wang worked hard

106
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,704
And the Yuan clan

107
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:52,972
I was also rescued

108
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:53,806
They are all rebellious

109
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,142
Somehow they are related

110
00:07:58,945 --> 00:07:59,846
Where is Miss Zhao?

111
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,547
At this moment

112
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,216
Stop wandering around

113
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:04,584
In case of discovery

114
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:05,651
We're all finished

115
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,719
What are you panicking about?

116
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,788
Aren't I worried about Miss Zhao?

117
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,857
You're not worried about me

118
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,125
Are you afraid that I will leak the news?

119
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:14,861
what news

120
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:20,500
What's wrong

121
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:25,171
Yuan Hao wants to kill Wang Kuan

122
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,339
My arm is burned

123
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:27,507
Can't

124
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:30,176
Don't be impulsive

125
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,178
This is forcing you to die

126
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,646
It’s not certain who will die.

127
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,582
This is clearly a trap.

128
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,656
If Mr. Yuan wants to take action

129
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,024
Maybe there's still a chance

130
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:46,726
It's no use begging him

131
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,060
You still have to rely on yourself

132
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,129
Too

133
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:51,564
Asking others is better than asking yourself

134
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:52,398
etc.

135
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:55,668
There's a wedding assassination coming soon.

136
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:56,335
at this time

137
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:57,770
Don't take any chances

138
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:58,738
Small Scene

139
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:04,544
I am disabled

140
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:06,212
classified as disabled

141
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:07,580
Disability

142
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:08,948
Duji third grade

143
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,784
People like me who lose one limb

144
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,619
It's a second-class disease

145
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,655
The disabled are not allowed to take the imperial examination

146
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,657
No official career in life

147
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:19,525
I'm sorry for wronging you.

148
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,328
I didn’t expect you to be an official

149
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:23,262
real

150
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,665
I know you are talented and knowledgeable

151
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,134
But I don't care if you are an official or not

152
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,136
As long as it's you

153
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:31,704
No matter what

154
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,139
It doesn't matter if you break an arm

155
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:34,006
It doesn't matter

156
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,107
That means

157
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,043
I am more important than a broken arm

158
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:37,810
certainly

159
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,612
Then what's the use of it?

160
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:00,299
Let’s come to Xixia during Qizhai

161
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,702
Is it for an arm?

162
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:05,972
we still have each other

163
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,541
Only each other

164
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,078
In this palace

165
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,280
The remaining

166
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:16,482
All can be discarded

167
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,124
The prince is well-versed in everything

168
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,425
Teach people to admire

169
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:36,602
The Prime Minister is right

170
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:39,205
The wedding is coming soon

171
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:41,974
That was the one who assassinated Yuan Hao

172
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,042
The best chance

173
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,078
It's also our last chance

174
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,642
No one is coming

175
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:17,677
Won't come

176
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:20,446
Want me to say

177
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,048
It doesn't have to be so troublesome at all

178
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:23,849
You lead the way

179
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,452
Rushed over and caught the person

180
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,187
Yuan Zhongxin was arrested

181
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,089
Yuantianguan will naturally take action

182
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,557
Then I will join forces with you

183
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:33,025
They would have discovered it

184
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,894
So what do you have to hide?

185
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,328
You only look at now

186
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:37,963
What's the meaning

187
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,367
After killing Yuantianguan

188
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,203
I will go back to Song Dynasty with them

189
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:45,438
Then what

190
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:47,173
If the family property had not been taken away

191
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:48,941
Distributed to Lingnan

192
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:51,677
My father wouldn't be here today either

193
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,346
The hatred of the Song Dynasty court

194
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,848
I haven't forgotten

195
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:58,884
Wait until I return to Song Dynasty

196
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,121
I will climb up at all costs

197
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:04,724
By the time

198
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:07,760
I will contact you secretly

199
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:10,296
If a war breaks out

200
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,798
I can also help spread some news

201
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,842
You want to join forces with me to destroy Song Dynasty

202
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,009
With your help

203
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,479
It's easier for me to climb up

204
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:31,484
one day

205
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:33,319
I will sit

206
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,887
A higher position than my father

207
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:37,923
I won't let him down

208
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:43,763
Are there any torches?

209
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:44,897
what to do

210
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:48,434
That arm is useless

211
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:50,703
you can take it back

212
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:54,640
How do I explain

213
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,602
I can't do it anymore

214
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:26,972
Where is my father's body?

215
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:27,973
Buried

216
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:28,974
You Song people

217
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,876
Isn’t it important to pay attention to burial?

218
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:31,977
foreign land

219
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:33,546
No refuge

220
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,148
I'll send him on his last journey

221
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:55,201
father

222
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:58,370
won't let you die

223
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,058
How about someone else lights the fire?

224
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,024
I'll give it to you

225
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,359
Prepare a jar

226
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:54,593
No

227
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,198
My dad loves the sky and the sea the most

228
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,468
Can't stand the cramped conditions

229
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:05,104
Collect in the altar

230
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,573
He will feel wronged

231
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,453
Today's wind

232
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,589
It was blowing towards the Song Dynasty

233
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:26,358
He is going home

234
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,198
Kid

235
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:35,734
You will definitely be a person in the future

236
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,136
On their wedding day

237
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:38,070
Make a move on you

238
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:40,940
Join forces with them

239
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,075
It's Brother Ning Ling

240
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,190
Originally the Crown Princess

241
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:33,192
Now she has become a princess

242
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,094
Are you happy?

243
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:47,573
Prime Minister

244
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:48,741
vassal

245
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:49,942
before wedding

246
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,877
The placement and protection of the imperial concubine

247
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:53,178
Take it up here.

248
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:54,179
yes

249
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,650
The new princess who has not moved to the clan is coming

250
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:32,785
what do you want me to do

251
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,353
Do you think Brother Ning Ling trusts you?

252
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,455
Your identity as a member of the Yeli clan

253
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:37,856
Will there be any hidden dangers?

254
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:49,668
Yuan Hao

255
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,063
Noriyoshi

256
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,132
I heard you this time

257
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,633
Always with the Queen

258
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:22,901
With the prince

259
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:24,369
Not the Queen anymore

260
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:27,940
Your wild family

261
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,708
It's endless.

262
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,376
There's always talent coming up

263
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,815
Why are you still carrying this?

264
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:37,649
used to sleeping

265
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:38,450
nostalgia

266
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,423
It’s good to miss the past

267
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,657
Nostalgic person

268
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,459
Only then will he be loyal to his old master

269
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,961
only

270
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:50,362
Pity

271
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,069
You should ask me now

272
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,637
What a pity

273
00:18:58,770 --> 00:18:59,738
What a pity

274
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,442
What a pity for your last name

275
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,078
Shame on your clan.

276
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,513
Where to start

277
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:08,947
The Yeli Clan

278
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:10,949
Once glorious

279
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:12,751
Decline now

280
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,821
You bear the surname of Yeli

281
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:17,823
shouldn't it

282
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,492
Should we shoulder the burden of reviving our clan?

283
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,661
Be a guard

284
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,463
obscurity

285
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,199
Doesn’t this count as letting down the family’s kindness?

286
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:32,237
look

287
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,039
If you have anything to say, just say it

288
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,841
If you say so, you will be punished by death.

289
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,442
I'll spare you the death penalty

290
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,411
The decline of the Yeli clan

291
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,714
It's because your butcher knife is sharp

292
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:51,190
Good boy

293
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:52,958
Have courage

294
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:54,760
well said

295
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,530
I can destroy a clan

296
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,831
I can too

297
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:02,067
Let a surname rise

298
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,371
I'll give you a chance now

299
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,273
Take control of military power

300
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:09,942
why me

301
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,811
Because you are loyal

302
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,280
I like loyal ministers

303
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,550
I also know

304
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:19,985
You are loyal to your old master

305
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,353
I promise you

306
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,255
Although I deposed the queen

307
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:24,823
But I will never kill her

308
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:25,891
This can be considered

309
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,759
The terms of your service to me

310
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:28,493
how

311
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:46,612
It is most rare for young people to understand current affairs

312
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:47,779
Get up

313
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:52,818
After the wedding

314
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:54,386
I'll let you take control of the military

315
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:56,455
But before the wedding

316
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,357
You have to do something for me first.

317
00:20:59,057 --> 00:20:59,758
What is it?

318
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:00,993
Not urgent

319
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:05,597
You guys from the Nori family?

320
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,732
Too much

321
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:09,067
I can't tell who is who

322
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,703
I haven't seen you before

323
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:13,438
So identity

324
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,540
Still need to confirm

325
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:18,744
I know

326
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,279
Superfluous

327
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,314
Blame me

328
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,216
think too much

329
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,653
I heard you have a best friend

330
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,388
Selling horses in the capital

331
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,456
I sent for him

332
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:34,493
Get your friends together

333
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:38,897
bring people in

334
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:39,331
yes

335
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:51,510
Meet the Qingtianzi

336
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:53,745
you know me

337
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:54,746
The army returns to the city

338
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,381
I’ve seen your heroic appearance from afar

339
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,952
I heard you have a friend

340
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,554
Yeli Langlie

341
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:03,989
The Little Man and the Yeli Clan

342
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:04,756
No relationship

343
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:05,824
I have absolutely no sympathy for you

344
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,993
What am I asking you?

345
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,194
Villain

346
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,829
I know Nouriro Retsu

347
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:11,663
But with him

348
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:12,731
Just talk about horses

349
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:14,232
Never involved anything else

350
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:15,867
look up

351
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:19,071
look at this man

352
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:36,722
Who is he?

353
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:44,296
Isn't he

354
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,033
Noriro Retsu?

355
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:50,535
Did he commit something?

356
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:51,636
The villain must

357
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:53,038
Tell everything you know

358
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,306
Won't cover up

359
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:57,275
young people

360
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,344
Be cautious when making friends

361
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,513
This friend of yours is not good

362
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:03,315
Does he still want to live?

363
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:05,851
Finally making friends

364
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:06,985
Kicked out of the palace

365
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:11,857
I'll just say it

366
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,592
It's just superfluous, right?

367
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,460
Okay, let's get down to business.

368
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,195
Actually it's very simple

369
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:18,897
Before the wedding

370
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:20,799
You keep an eye on Brother Ning Ling for me

371
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,534
His every move

372
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:24,603
Just tell me everything

373
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,672
rest assured

374
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,274
Even a tiger won't eat its own cubs

375
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:30,942
I won't kill him

376
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,612
It's just that this kid is very ambitious

377
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:35,080
Gotta be on guard

378
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,116
I'm also afraid that he will make mistakes

379
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,651
This is also for his own good

380
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:40,519
minister

381
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:41,787
Take orders

382
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,355
Do your job well

383
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:45,390
The Revival of the Nori Clan

384
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,025
It's on you.

385
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,461
how do you

386
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:58,396
So simple

387
00:24:58,864 --> 00:24:59,798
got used to

388
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:01,266
people alive

389
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,902
There are always some preferences

390
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:06,438
like you

391
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:08,640
Nothing can be seen

392
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,774
Either

393
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:11,543
Calm as water

394
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,211
Either

395
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:15,347
ulterior motives

396
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:17,582
My beloved horse

397
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,818
So I got acquainted with the horse dealer just now

398
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:30,695
Another Day

399
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:32,664
Give you some good horses

400
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:36,735
Thank you Qingtianzi

401
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:55,153
Where are you hiding?

402
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,421
Cliff outside the window

403
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:58,590
Yuan Hao is here to win people's hearts

404
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:59,558
i heard

405
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:01,860
That horse dealer is also from Song Dynasty

406
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:02,561
no

407
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:04,863
Then why did he hide his identity for you?

408
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,831
I choose the name Noriro Retsu

409
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:07,499
that's because

410
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,000
He doesn't have many acquaintances in Xingqing Mansion

411
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:10,468
three years ago

412
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:12,304
I'm approaching this horse trafficker

413
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,039
In fact, he is not the only one

414
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,774
three years

415
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:17,642
I have a lot of so-called friends

416
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,344
All for this moment

417
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:20,178
so

418
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:21,079
Just asking

419
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,547
Yeli Langlie's acquaintance

420
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:23,982
It's all your fault for the past three years

421
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:25,317
Created connections

422
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:26,651
almost

423
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:28,653
Not afraid of anything unexpected

424
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,621
We know each other in Xingqing Mansion

425
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:30,789
A wild and fierce person

426
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:31,756
All gone

427
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:34,559
Cruel enough

428
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:35,694
Not all of them will be killed.

429
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:37,662
Some found reasons to move away.

430
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:38,863
Don't show your weakness

431
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,899
Wen Wuqi disdains joining the world

432
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,134
But secretly planning for me

433
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:44,269
My side

434
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:45,937
no trace to be found

435
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:22,273
If there is no war

436
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:24,442
they should be able to

437
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:25,410
Keep living

438
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:26,945
Become an old man and an old woman

439
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,815
The way those guys are getting older

440
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:33,652
I can't imagine it at all

441
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:38,623
quite funny

442
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:02,514
I remember that time in the Secret Pavilion

443
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:03,782
Just take it with you

444
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:05,784
yes

445
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:08,586
I heard

446
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,389
You fall asleep as soon as you enter class

447
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,091
It made even the captain angry.

448
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:14,559
People are lazy

449
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:17,629
But leave this quilt

450
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:18,930
I can't sleep no matter what

451
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:20,298
recognize the bed

452
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:21,399
In this case

453
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,269
Why don't you put this quilt on the bed?

454
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:28,373
How long has it been since you closed your eyes?

455
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,145
After Wen Wuqi and Chu Niao left,

456
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,115
You never rested

457
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:40,919
Yuan Hao is not dead yet

458
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:44,589
You are the only one left in Bazhai

459
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:48,359
So I have no way out

460
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,531
Why are you looking for me?

461
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:56,735
For Brother Ning Ling

462
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:05,744
The imperial concubine will stay here for the time being.

463
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,011
If needed

464
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:08,146
Just look for me

465
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,416
I'm not the princess yet

466
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:13,251
We're getting married in a few days

467
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,986
It doesn't hurt to call in advance.

468
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,491
The Queen is tired

469
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:20,792
Please step back first.

470
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:52,290
Be alert everywhere

471
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,491
Remove my order

472
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:55,093
No one is allowed to touch the princess

473
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:57,495
You two stay here

474
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:58,496
Always listen to orders

475
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:00,298
yes

476
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,595
Zhao Jian changed people

477
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:31,496
unnoticed

478
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:32,797
Guarding the imperial concubine

479
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:34,399
They are all my soldiers

480
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:35,900
God is helping me

481
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:37,902
wrong

482
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,772
It should be God helping you and me

483
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:43,942
Qing Tianzi has an impatient temper

484
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,877
Planning to get married before the New Year

485
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,879
Then there are only a few days left

486
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:49,147
Poisoned wine and sharp swords

487
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,015
Everything is ready

488
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:24,515
When

489
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:25,383
I will arrange

490
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:26,985
Those young men from the Song Dynasty

491
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:28,152
Stay outside the door

492
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,320
Responding to Zhao Jian

493
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:40,331
Walk

494
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:43,868
after

495
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:46,871
It was the prince who was ordered to do so in danger

496
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:48,306
Taking over Daxia

497
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:51,576
It’s me and the Prime Minister

498
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:52,944
Sharing power

499
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:54,178
Don't dare

500
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:55,546
Prince

501
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:57,015
The Lord of Daxia

502
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:58,082
Prime Minister

503
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:00,118
This arrangement is very appropriate

504
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:01,219
Thus

505
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:02,820
Those Song Dynasty boys

506
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,322
will escape safely

507
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:05,223
It's all cooperation

508
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:06,624
Each one takes what he needs

509
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,626
Only looking forward to the prince

510
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:10,895
Take control of Daxia as soon as possible

511
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:13,398
Prime Minister

512
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:14,866
You have worked hard

513
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:22,934
These are the personal guards stationed at the palace.

514
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:24,035
so are they

515
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:26,170
People who are secretly loyal to me

516
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,940
The prince also has secret chess in the palace

517
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:31,476
Hidden until now

518
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:32,977
just for this moment

519
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,013
You gather them secretly

520
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,347
wedding day

521
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:37,515
let them together

522
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,783
Follow me outside the temple

523
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,352
When the time comes, raise your troops and attack

524
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:44,322
In the name of revenge for the Qingtianzi

525
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:45,990
Kill those young men

526
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:47,592
Then

527
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:50,361
No more hidden lies

528
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,733
Just let these thieves

529
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:59,270
Sacrifice to my father’s spirit in heaven

530
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:01,672
Let all the ministers see it

531
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:04,509
I would rather your brother respect filial piety and love

532
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,778
It’s good that everyone will return to their hearts

533
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:08,946
Prince's good plan

534
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,518
After all, the love between father and son is deep

535
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,586
avenge father

536
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,322
as a matter of course

537
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:08,099
Qing Tianzi

538
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,235
Since we are getting married in a grand ceremony,

539
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:12,503
now

540
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:14,472
It’s time to worship the gods of heaven and earth

541
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,074
What god do you worship?

542
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:20,178
It's time for the gods to come and worship me

543
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:22,113
Qing Tianzi

544
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:25,550
Already killed the angel

545
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,251
And brought about divine punishment

546
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:29,754
Now the whole world knows

547
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:31,122
The Sheep Guardian is angry

548
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,190
In this case

549
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,624
What's the point of worshiping him?

550
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,861
The goat god wants to kill me

551
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:38,462
OK

552
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,798
Let him come

553
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:45,836
today

554
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:48,706
I slander God

555
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:50,942
Just want to see

556
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:53,277
What can God do to me?

557
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,148
If I don't die

558
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:59,450
It is God's will

559
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:02,186
Even the gods will avoid my sharp edge

560
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:04,255
henceforth

561
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:05,489
All the gods

562
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:07,225
Everyone will kneel at my feet

563
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:19,437
Qingtianzi Shengming

564
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:23,507
Qingtianzi Shengming

565
00:37:58,709 --> 00:37:59,377
sons and ministers

566
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:00,911
Congratulations, Father

567
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:03,681
Brother Ning Ling

568
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,584
I married your bride

569
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:08,953
I owe you one

570
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:10,921
Sooner or later, I'll just give you one back.

571
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:12,056
Everything in Daxia

572
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,624
They all belong to the father

573
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:15,793
well said

574
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:17,561
You spend the New Year here

575
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:18,996
Let’s go back to Xingqing Mansion

576
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:19,930
Sons and ministers obey orders

577
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:21,399
Take a look

578
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:23,267
the two of us

579
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:25,269
It's clearly a loving father and a filial son.

580
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:27,071
But how could there be

581
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:28,973
So many people think

582
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:31,475
You and I are not in harmony

583
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:32,109
Father

584
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,282
