1
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,242
Yuantianguan’s purpose of coming to Tanzhou

2
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:50,443
Not just looking for

3
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,478
What about Polaris?

4
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:52,078
Nayuan Tianguan

5
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:53,012
Why do this?

6
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:54,114
What about natural disasters?

7
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,215
how could I know

8
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:56,516
Will it

9
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,084
This is how to find Pollux

10
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:00,420
Right

11
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:05,492
I don't understand

12
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:06,793
What does this have to do with finding someone?

13
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,461
According to the dead ghost uncle

14
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,463
This Polaris star is not easy to find.

15
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,198
Yeah, and then what?

16
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:13,800
Looking for someone in Yuantianguan

17
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,635
The details he cares about

18
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:16,769
Will it

19
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,238
It’s all related to Polaris

20
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,410
Have you searched every room?

21
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,212
There are books in the house

22
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,047
I found them all.

23
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:29,015
Not in the book either

24
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,083
With a secret message or something?

25
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,251
What kind of books do you have?

26
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:32,819
There are all kinds of books

27
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:34,053
poetry

28
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,054
Annotation

29
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:35,922
Miscellaneous notes

30
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:36,756
Wu Jin

31
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:38,491
How many are there?

32
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,492
What is the proportion

33
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:40,660
I didn't count this

34
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:42,695
Among ten books

35
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:44,364
Five of them are witchcraft books

36
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:44,931
don't you think

37
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,232
Is this a bit much?

38
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:48,735
The Theory of Disasters in the Five Elements

39
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:49,602
and sorcery

40
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:50,703
Originally from the same lineage

41
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:53,072
You said this Yuantian Pass

42
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,040
He did it for no reason

43
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,275
What are you doing all this for?

44
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,115
What does Xiao Jing want to say?

45
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,417
I'm afraid of saying something wrong

46
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,286
It's okay, it doesn't matter if you're right or wrong

47
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,620
If you have an idea, say it

48
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,523
Would it be less complicated?

49
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:11,291
Maybe

50
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,459
He just likes these things

51
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:14,394
Only then can I read these books

52
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:15,495
get these objects

53
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:16,563
Yes

54
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,364
What Xiaojing said makes perfect sense

55
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:18,965
we started

56
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:19,832
That's what I thought too

57
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:20,700
but not like this

58
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:22,235
why

59
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:24,304
Because in every room

60
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:25,205
All these books

61
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,040
A person can be said to be a preference

62
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,074
Everyone has

63
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,609
It's more like a collective effort

64
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:30,610
Looking for clues

65
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:32,645
and

66
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:34,814
Yuan Tianguan is surrounded by Xixia people

67
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,183
The Xixia people had their own gods

68
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,351
They can't

69
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,352
Run to the territory of the Song Dynasty

70
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:40,820
to study these things

71
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:44,123
Take a look

72
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:44,857
Small Scene

73
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:46,259
I can already draw inferences from one instance.

74
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,362
Research disasters

75
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:51,598
Related to Polaris

76
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,099
That is to say

77
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,969
Beihexing is also studying this

78
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,071
Or

79
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,408
Where the star Pollux appears

80
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,810
There are natural disasters

81
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:06,446
Yes

82
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,514
If we talk about cutting off the dragon's head

83
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:09,916
Related to Polaris

84
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:10,917
So the Xixia people

85
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,685
Worship these five evil elements

86
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,053
You can guess why

87
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,054
Treat disaster with disaster

88
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:15,888
That's right

89
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:17,957
Pollux is related to natural disasters

90
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,459
And the Xixia people were also superstitious

91
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:20,393
So they are afraid

92
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,662
So worship this five-element vision

93
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:23,596
I want to borrow

94
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,031
The so-called power of disaster

95
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:25,965
Resist crisis

96
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:27,000
I see

97
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,601
Sacrifice habits of the Goat God

98
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,502
It's also the same truth

99
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,604
Please be more safe.

100
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:33,806
There is progress in the office

101
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,077
What about Yuantianguan people?

102
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:39,512
Why are you missing?

103
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,980
It’s the same problem just now

104
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,282
Yuantianguan comes here

105
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,216
for what

106
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,119
Find the Northern Star

107
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,354
Has he already

108
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:49,689
Found the whereabouts of Beihexing

109
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,090
So just left here

110
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:52,492
there is a question

111
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,060
A natural disaster is a natural disaster

112
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,094
There is no evil in the world

113
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:55,928
I know this

114
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:56,796
The Northern Star

115
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,398
There is disaster wherever you go

116
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,499
Why?

117
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,567
because because

118
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,037
because

119
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,005
Depends on human effort

120
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,808
Pollux is causing man-made disasters

121
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:13,513
So scary

122
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,817
The one who cut off the dragon's head was also Beihe.

123
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:20,086
Just returned to the village

124
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:21,087
The faucet is missing

125
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,055
Yu Chiyuan was frightened

126
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,489
I just found a chance to knock him out.

127
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:24,757
The faucet is missing

128
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,292
Isn't that dangerous?

129
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,760
Nothing will happen to the damn uncle, right?

130
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,032
River Star

131
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:07,800
If Yuantianguan

132
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,535
The whereabouts of Polaris have been found

133
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:10,403
Doesn't that mean

134
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:11,771
Is he faster than us?

135
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,039
People in the village said

136
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,440
Who cut that dragon statue?

137
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,409
A student from Yuelu Academy

138
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:17,143
in ten books

139
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,511
Five of them are witchcraft books

140
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,445
What about the rest?

141
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:20,780
There are all kinds of miscellaneous books.

142
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,280
yuantianguan

143
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,482
Why do you need to read these miscellaneous books?

144
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,117
He can watch whatever he likes

145
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,152
But there are books in every room

146
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,353
so

147
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,822
Xixia people also read these miscellaneous books

148
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:32,458
Think about it carefully

149
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,060
What about these books?

150
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,061
All have one thing in common

151
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,398
I just flipped through it casually

152
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:39,532
Didn't look carefully

153
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,969
Chief, you know

154
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:44,170
I am destined to commit a crime

155
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,271
I feel dizzy when I read the words

156
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:46,939
So just tell me

157
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:47,640
Is the answer good?

158
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,342
all these books

159
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,144
All come from Tanzhou literati

160
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,812
And these people who write books

161
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,447
There is also one thing in common

162
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,249
They all came from Yuelu Academy

163
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,650
It’s Yuelu Academy again

164
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,452
Yuan Tian Guan is at Chabei River Star

165
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,753
every book found

166
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,121
All from Yuelu Academy

167
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,357
This direction couldn't be clearer

168
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,125
Cutting off the dragon's head will bring disaster

169
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:07,894
They are also students of Yuelu Academy.

170
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,162
all clues

171
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,396
They all point to Yuelu Academy

172
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:11,264
That's right

173
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:12,965
Then we also have to enter the academy

174
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:16,302
Pretend to be a student

175
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:17,036
No

176
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,405
not just students

177
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,040
if we

178
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,041
I want to take Yuelu Academy

179
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:22,942
Check it thoroughly

180
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,011
Just by being a student

181
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:25,845
I'm afraid not

182
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,114
What are their identities?

183
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,417
Wang Kuan, you are here to give lectures

184
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:32,552
Directly serve as a teacher

185
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:33,486
Wollu Academy

186
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:34,654
There is a plaque inscribed by the late emperor himself

187
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:35,621
Extremely strict in academics

188
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:36,956
It is not easy to fake the position of lecturer

189
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,758
There must be nothing wrong with your knowledge

190
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:39,559
question of identity

191
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,726
Leave it to Lu Nanshan

192
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:41,561
Then I'll try

193
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,129
And me

194
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:43,930
Small Scene

195
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,898
Wolulu Academy and Secret Pavilion are different

196
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:47,300
They don't accept female students

197
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,601
Would you like to go to the kitchen?

198
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:50,436
Okay, I'm good at this

199
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,939
Xue Ying takes a nursing home position

200
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:54,173
good

201
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,843
Nursing home lectures and kitchen

202
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:57,977
All aspects are available

203
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,312
Then the three of us

204
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,849
when a student

205
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:05,651
No way

206
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:07,053
Yanei

207
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:09,956
You are the only one who is a student

208
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,791
What about you?

209
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,292
Actually about the academy

210
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:14,527
have a place

211
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,562
Already used by all of us

212
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:17,096
Ignored

213
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:17,997
Didn't take care of it

214
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:18,998
Which

215
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:21,734
parents

216
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:26,873
What's the meaning

217
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:27,974
We Qizhai do things

218
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:29,175
Always

219
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,142
Watertight

220
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:31,444
Zhao Jian

221
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:32,712
sacrifice something

222
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:33,980
Both of us

223
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:36,649
be a parent

224
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:38,885
This is interesting

225
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,052
You two actually

226
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:42,522
its not right

227
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:44,757
Whose parents are you two?

228
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:45,491
Yanei

229
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:46,926
You are the only one who is a student

230
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,094
No way

231
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,262
I am your father

232
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:52,565
this

233
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:53,966
It's your mother

234
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,737
We are a family of three

235
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:58,671
Have fun

236
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:00,406
This makes it very real

237
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:01,240
your age

238
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,542
How can you be my parents?

239
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,043
This is very unreasonable

240
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,511
Will anyone believe me if I tell you?

241
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,013
It is completely reasonable

242
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,481
How is it reasonable?

243
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:09,815
Suppose there is a student

244
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,250
You are this student

245
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,519
your biological mother

246
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,153
Leave early

247
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:17,490
So your biological father

248
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,724
Renewed the string

249
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,459
Reasonable or unreasonable

250
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,329
Zhao Jian is so beautiful

251
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,130
Your father married her

252
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:25,231
Reasonable or unreasonable

253
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:26,365
Chief

254
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:27,433
Don't be so happy first

255
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,367
how about you

256
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,102
Then your father passed away too

257
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,271
The girl you have now

258
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:33,639
Also played a new chord

259
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,374
So the two of us

260
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:36,008
Although with you

261
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,777
There is no direct blood relationship

262
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:39,478
But they are still your parents.

263
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:40,646
Reasonable or unreasonable

264
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,849
Your biological mother died early

265
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:45,451
Then your father passed away too

266
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:46,619
So the two of us

267
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:47,286
Although with you

268
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:48,955
There is no direct blood relationship

269
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:49,855
But still

270
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:50,756
Your parents

271
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:51,657
Reasonable or unreasonable

272
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:53,759
This is wrong

273
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:54,760
look

274
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,796
Wang Kuan found it unreasonable

275
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,631
To remarry after losing one's wife is to renew the relationship

276
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,300
If I find you again, I will remarry.

277
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:02,902
right

278
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,537
Wang Jianshu said this

279
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,973
All the loopholes are plugged.

280
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,543
Why do you have to pretend to be a parent?

281
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:11,711
It's not necessary

282
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:12,712
child

283
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,880
Think about it carefully

284
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,915
Should North River

285
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,416
The same generation as the dead ghost uncle

286
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:18,651
his age

287
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:19,518
Even if you are young

288
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:20,086
It is impossible

289
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,053
Young like us

290
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:23,723
That's true

291
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:24,991
Since you are this age

292
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,659
It has to be related to the academy

293
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:27,393
is it possible

294
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,461
Is the student’s parent

295
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:29,895
possible

296
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:31,263
Does that mean someone has to

297
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,331
Pretending to be a student’s parent

298
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:33,933
How about investigating from this angle?

299
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:37,436
It seems to make sense

300
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:38,104
Yanei

301
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,375
I know you feel awkward

302
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,843
It's really awkward

303
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:45,845
Zhao Jian and I are also very awkward

304
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,380
this kind of thing

305
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,814
It really makes it difficult for us

306
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:49,982
Very sad too

307
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:50,616
but

308
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,451
Forced by the situation

309
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,053
We are also for

310
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,287
Investigate the North River star

311
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,023
It’s also for the sake of righteousness

312
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,098
We all have to hold on

313
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,136
Then the good thing is settled like that

314
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,005
But I always feel

315
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:13,839
It still doesn’t seem right

316
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:14,740
next topic

317
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,575
Before we entered the academy

318
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:17,543
First you have to

319
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,011
Yu Chiyuan’s situation is clarified

320
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:20,980
What happened to Yu Chiyuan?

321
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:23,082
First

322
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,517
we need to know

323
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,918
Is Yuchiyuan lying?

324
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:27,119
if he starts from the beginning

325
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,254
Just lying to us

326
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,455
Then all our calculations

327
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:30,523
There may be defects

328
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:32,558
That

329
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:33,793
Of course it's unlikely

330
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:34,960
second

331
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:35,995
That dad of mine

332
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:37,396
It might be a bit difficult to deal with

333
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,432
So just to be on the safe side

334
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:40,833
if possible

335
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:42,435
Still have to make a secret move

336
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:43,736
Buy Yu Chiyuan

337
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:45,171
but he looked

338
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,439
Very loyal to your father

339
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,174
But he is afraid of ghosts.

340
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,644
You have to pretend to be a ghost

341
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,979
The word "yanei" is used correctly.

342
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:05,458
Small Scene

343
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,259
Do you want to be a fairy?

344
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:09,962
Everyone in the yamen held on.

345
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:10,996
I can do it too

346
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:12,732
I

347
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,735
Everyone deserves the name Qizhai

348
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,013
its not right

349
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:29,615
I suffered a loss

350
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,717
Is it the same thing?

351
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:56,342
Xue Ying

352
00:12:58,844 --> 00:12:59,478
Xue Ying

353
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:12,391
I didn't break your head

354
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,965
There is no trace of Yuantian Pass now

355
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:20,966
perhaps

356
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,102
There will be clues if you go to Yuelu Academy

357
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:26,806
We really have to sneak into the academy

358
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:28,607
Just need to change my identity

359
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:32,578
Change identity

360
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:33,979
How can it be that easy?

361
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,713
yes

362
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:35,714
We are in Tanzhou

363
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:36,582
No acquaintances

364
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:37,416
Difficult

365
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,253
I'll arrange it

366
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,391
Xiaolu Zhangyuan has close friends all over the world

367
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,493
At least I have one

368
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,395
The identity of the Deputy Privy Councilor

369
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,096
I must go there myself

370
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:52,298
Guiyuan Army Camp

371
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,165
Not difficult

372
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:58,370
What about us?

373
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,072
You just stay here

374
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,474
If traces of Yuantian Pass are found

375
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,043
Get it now

376
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,445
Rest assured, Xiaolu Zhangyuan

377
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,480
I'm sure I'll kill my relatives out of justice

378
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,455
Better remember what you said

379
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:23,329
adult

380
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,165
I'm in town on business

381
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:27,366
you stay here

382
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:28,300
yes

383
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,170
Si Weixing and Yu Chiyuan

384
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,137
mysteriously missing

385
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:33,138
I hope not

386
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:34,440
What's wrong with you again?

387
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:35,741
Definitely stay here

388
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:39,044
Qizhai and others

389
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,779
What was said and done

390
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,281
Remember to tell me when you come back

391
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:43,449
clear

392
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:46,886
Pei Xuan

393
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,155
Han Duanzhang's incident

394
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:51,924
without me

395
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,125
your whole family

396
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,560
Everyone will be involved

397
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,463
Your kindness is unforgettable

398
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,499
Tanzhou is done

399
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,302
The so-called kindness is wiped out in one stroke

400
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:04,770
Do you agree?

401
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:07,039
What's the name of the Commander-in-Chief?

402
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:08,440
Even if there is no kindness

403
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:10,409
The villain is also willing to follow the leader

404
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,278
My Pei family has prospered

405
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:13,812
All hope is on the head of the academy

406
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:18,484
Just have this idea

407
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:20,886
very good

408
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,751
Mr. Pei didn't follow him into the city.

409
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:54,086
What is this for?

410
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:54,820
Second place

411
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,521
Mr. Lu this time

412
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:56,488
Take me to Tanzhou

413
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:57,923
You should use my identity

414
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:58,857
after all

415
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,092
My sister is also a member of Qizhai

416
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,060
I am here

417
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,461
Mr. Lu can control my sister

418
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,862
Control my sister

419
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,130
You can threaten Wang Kuan

420
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,966
You see it quite clearly.

421
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,033
The villain follows here

422
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,168
It’s also a helpless move

423
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,503
After all, with my status

424
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:12,972
I can't afford to offend Mr. Lu

425
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,774
Of course I can't afford to offend you either.

426
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:17,476
so what

427
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:18,978
Mr. Lu has entered the city now.

428
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:21,080
No matter what you do

429
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,414
I'm here

430
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:23,649
You will be a little worried to some extent

431
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:27,853
Please take a look, you two

432
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,421
This is a water bag

433
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:30,422
This is a magic trick

434
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:31,323
Look again,

435
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:32,725
This is sweat medicine

436
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,893
Why do you bring this?

437
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,929
Be prepared when you go out

438
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,481
What are you doing?

439
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:56,682
I'll take a nap first

440
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,283
Don't bother everyone

441
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,291
Xiao Xiaojing, this younger brother

442
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,293
A bit interesting

443
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:14,400
completion

444
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:16,201
completion

445
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:17,569
It's over. It's over.

446
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:18,704
completion

447
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:23,475
Dragon God is angry

448
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,044
The Dragon God is definitely angry

449
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:26,645
Mr. Yuan is gone

450
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,213
Xue Ying is gone too

451
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:30,582
what should I do

452
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:36,889
sorry Sorry

453
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:37,756
sorry

454
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,091
Excuse me. Excuse me.

455
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:40,492
sorry

456
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:41,293
sorry

457
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,361
sorry

458
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:44,196
sorry

459
00:17:58,877 --> 00:17:59,812
Huang Wei

460
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,459
Lord Huang Wei bless you

461
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:14,393
Get rid of rats

462
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,061
I am most afraid of big rats

463
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:17,996
You're welcome

464
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,928
Just ran away

465
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:51,296
Wait a minute

466
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:52,731
There are two more words

467
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:55,200
Go fast

468
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:18,824
who

469
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:29,735
Wang Kuan

470
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:32,771
Why are you in Tanzhou?

471
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:38,210
Are you stalking us?

472
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:40,379
What are you asking for?

473
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:00,432
No breath

474
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:02,534
died

475
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:16,982
Pei Jing

476
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,651
Why did you come to Tanzhou?

477
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,392
How did you find this place?

478
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:37,102
Xue Ying

479
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,775
Wasn't it Wang Kuan just now?

480
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,383
No way

481
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:09,635
Just ran away

482
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:10,969
Really scared

483
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,841
Something bad is happening.

484
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:19,478
Haunted

485
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:20,912
What's wrong, don't be afraid

486
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:21,847
speak slowly

487
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,814
Wang Kuanren

488
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,249
Crack!

489
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:37,596
died

490
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,398
The so-called life and death

491
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:42,968
But in one thought, I

492
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,241
Are you Pei Jing?

493
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:51,943
Why did you come to Tanzhou?

494
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:58,383
Where is Xue Ying?

495
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:04,323
How come you can still talk like this?

496
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,692
Why are you back?

497
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,760
Didn’t you go to worship God?

498
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:12,698
That's right

499
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:15,334
Has the Dragon God not forgiven you?

500
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,035
That must be because he is ungrateful

501
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:17,903
It hurts us

502
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:19,237
become like this

503
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,241
Don't, don't, don't come here

504
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:24,943
do not come

505
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,516
who the hell are you

506
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,252
Give me my head back

507
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:40,525
I see

508
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,129
Xue Ying said he saw a dragon shape appear

509
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:45,530
obviously

510
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:48,367
Are you possessed by the Dragon God?

511
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:56,942
I swear to God

512
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:59,010
I didn't take your head off

513
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,245
I didn't take it either.

514
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:04,316
at this point

515
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:07,052
You should know very well

516
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:09,755
Could it be

517
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:12,457
You want me to get the faucet back?

518
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,693
Otherwise it will

519
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,795
receive the same treatment as them

520
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:18,897
punish

521
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,433
but

522
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,202
But you have great powers

523
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:27,439
Why did you choose me?

524
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:30,142
Yes, why?

525
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:31,777
why

526
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:33,311
why

527
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:36,681
I see

528
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:38,016
What do you unserstand

529
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:44,122
Mortal things must be done by mere mortals

530
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,892
I have believed in various gods since I was a child

531
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:47,926
at this point

532
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,561
No one else can compare to me

533
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:50,996
So you look for me

534
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:53,198
It's a test for me

535
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:54,699
Choose me again

536
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:56,234
is not it

537
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,337
You are quite smart

538
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,777
My greatest characteristic is that I am smart

539
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,367
Reversal of life and death

540
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,336
Manipulate the time

541
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:33,371
Then you now

542
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:34,639
know what to do

543
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:38,743
eyes closed

544
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:58,530
fainted

545
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:03,201
Small Scene

546
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:04,369
You did a good job

547
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:06,671
In fact, most of it is him

548
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:07,772
Guessed

549
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,808
People

550
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,943
It’s easiest to lie to yourself

551
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:13,678
sharp

552
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:30,328
Xue Ying

553
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:34,032
Xue Ying

554
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:51,116
dragon

555
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:53,552
dragon dragon god

556
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:55,687
What dragon god?

557
00:25:58,523 --> 00:25:59,558
Xue Ying

558
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,192
Why is he here?

559
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:03,128
where is this

560
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:04,996
This is Tanzhou

561
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,332
Tanzhou

562
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,534
Why did it appear in Tanzhou?

563
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:13,138
What do you think

564
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:17,776
I was still in Kaifeng just now

565
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:19,911
How did you end up in Tanzhou?

566
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:25,450
Then do you remember

567
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,118
how did you come

568
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:31,890
I don't remember at all

569
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,292
God's Power

570
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:36,294
It's really otherworldly.

571
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,166
woke up

572
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:47,038
Xiaojing, why are you here?

573
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:48,139
I do not know

574
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:49,741
Appeared here in the blink of an eye

575
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:53,244
suddenly appeared

576
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:54,279
you are crazy

577
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:55,880
People are thousands of miles apart in Kaifeng

578
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,015
Why did it suddenly appear?

579
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:58,516
Just that

580
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:00,352
What

581
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:03,955
Shut up

582
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,126
What's wrong

583
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,295
you didn't hear her

584
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:13,031
hear something

585
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:15,533
Keep your mouth shut

586
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,402
I know

587
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,137
What do you know

588
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,171
nothing

589
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:26,244
Small Scene

590
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:27,879
How did you get here?

591
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,248
I do not know

592
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:34,119
Stop asking

593
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,353
people suddenly appear

594
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:36,254
Why can't you ask

595
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:38,757
let me tell you

596
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:39,724
She is possessed by the dragon god

597
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:40,659
Do you believe it?

598
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:42,560
you ate the wrong thing

599
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:17,262
Why are you sleeping here?

600
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:22,367
The Mongolian sweat medicine is pretty strong

601
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,735
Slept pretty well

602
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:34,512
Mr. Lu is back

603
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:35,380
Not back yet

604
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,650
But before he comes back

605
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,151
Let's discuss it

606
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:41,619
If he comes back

607
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,054
what are you going to say

608
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,156
nothing happened

609
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,891
Then why are you helping us?

610
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,160
After all, my sister is also in Qizhai

611
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:51,663
Then follow Lu Nanshan all the way

612
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:52,897
What do you want to do?

613
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:54,999
nothing

614
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:56,367
Just timid and obedient

615
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:58,737
Are you afraid of Lu Nanshan?

616
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:01,139
Taking into account the relationship between siblings

617
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,374
Just in case, always choose one

618
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:05,243
What should you do?

619
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:11,516
Find Yuantian Pass

620
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,251
Find the leader

621
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:18,022
The faucet was broken by Mr. Yuan

622
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,659
Mortal things must be done by mere mortals

623
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:23,862
If you can accomplish this

624
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:25,663
I will give you eternal life

625
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:28,967
do not worry

626
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:30,535
Let’s come to Tanzhou

627
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:31,636
I'm looking for Mr. Yuan.

628
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:33,638
you go alone

629
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:36,040
Myself

630
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,979
Row row row

631
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,047
It's not good if there are too many people doing this kind of thing

632
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:43,715
I know

633
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:45,383
I'll go find it myself

634
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:47,652
My business

635
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:49,654
Do not tell others

636
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:51,489
clear

637
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,258
Especially Yuantianguan

638
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:54,592
OK

639
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:00,231
His Excellency Dragon God

640
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:03,635
Can I replace

641
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,903
Mr. Yuan, please give me a favor

642
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,138
If he really cut off the dragon's head

643
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:08,840
I have one anyway.

644
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,742
A small feat in retrieving the faucet

645
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:12,010
or

646
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,779
Please forgive Mr. Yuan for once

647
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:18,249
After finding Yuantian Pass

648
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:20,518
See you at Yuelu Academy

649
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,054
Wollu Academy

650
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:26,991
Row Row

651
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,377
Quite easy to deceive

652
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:48,880
He is afraid of ghosts.

653
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,814
so these things

654
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:50,982
I really can't believe it.

655
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,851
Xiaojing, you did a good job

656
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:53,651
real

657
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,722
But it was all taught to me by Brother Wang.

658
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,057
for example

659
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:00,525
Action

660
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,126
And your expression should be more serious

661
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:03,862
I studied very seriously at that time

662
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:06,231
Wang Kuan is a person who can’t lie

663
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:07,365
teach you these

664
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:09,400
your relationship

665
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:11,236
What happened to the relationship?

666
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:13,872
Quite clever

667
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:21,379
Yu Chiyuan took the initiative to find Yuan Tianguan

668
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,248
Even if this secret move has been made,

669
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:25,516
After Lu Nanshan comes back tomorrow,

670
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:26,684
We should be able to successfully

671
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:27,852
Infiltrate Wolulu Academy

672
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:30,221
but

673
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,756
They can’t all be students

674
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,724
it's simple

675
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:33,892
Xiao Xue

676
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,360
You go back and pretend to be my book boy

677
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:39,063
Am I not a nurse?

678
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,165
Nursing home is unreasonable

679
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,901
It is only right for a scholar to lead a scholar

680
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:45,536
Does it fit

681
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:47,639
Just don't draw the knife randomly

682
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:51,242
besides

683
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:53,044
Be careful

684
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:54,379
I changed my name

685
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,380
Don't make a mistake

686
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,648
what is it call

687
00:31:58,716 --> 00:31:59,584
Wayne

688
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,502
OK Wayne

689
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:18,503
You are confused

690
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,371
Call me Master Wayne

691
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:23,007
OK, Master Wayne

692
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,411
Mainly because they are too senior

693
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,046
Otherwise you will call me master

694
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,352
They are all temporary status

695
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:35,353
No matter what you call it, it’s the same

696
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:36,254
no the same

697
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:37,288
happy to hear

698
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:40,525
One final explanation

699
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,260
This trip south

700
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,728
You must find Yuantian Pass

701
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:44,595
otherwise

702
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:47,765
Yuan Zhongxin’s crime

703
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:48,900
But it can't be washed off

704
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:53,638
And don’t forget

705
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,373
The mission to kill Yuan Hao

706
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:56,541
we are not done yet

707
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,376
If you can convince Yuan Tianguan

708
00:32:58,376 --> 00:32:59,711
Let him help us eradicate Yuan Hao

709
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:00,511
eliminate war

710
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:01,980
Not a bad idea

711
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,282
I'm afraid that he will be determined to serve Xixia

712
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:08,353
Of course it would be best if we can cooperate

713
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:09,854
But all our things

714
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:10,722
Still have to go first

715
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:12,023
Think about the worst

716
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:12,890
Another point

717
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:15,259
Polaris has not appeared yet

718
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,961
If you really encounter

719
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:18,363
Don't take it lightly

720
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:20,164
Let’s not let Beihexing

721
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:21,766
Fall into the hands of Yuan Hao

722
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:22,734
That's what it means

723
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:24,035
clear

724
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:25,236
besides

725
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,772
The whereabouts of the dead uncle are unknown now

726
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,240
He is so skilled

727
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,775
also disappeared without a trace

728
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,276
It can be seen that the road ahead is difficult

729
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:41,052
As the name suggests

730
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:42,754
Wollu Academy

731
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:44,422
Built at the foot of Yuelu Mountain

732
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:47,692
At first there were only about sixty students

733
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:50,395
Fortunately, Shan Changzhou style

734
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:51,696
Valued by the late emperor

735
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:52,296
Therefore

736
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:53,731
Middle gate plaque

737
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:55,800
Four characters of Yuelu Academy

738
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,435
It is the late emperor’s personal inscription

739
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,973
The academy became famous as a result

740
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,542
The number of students has already exceeded 100

741
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:08,379
Tell you so much

742
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,014
Just hope you

743
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:11,482
able to act with caution

744
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,017
Don't make a big mess

745
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:15,053
Don’t worry, Xiaolu Zhangyuan

746
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:16,154
Our Qizhai

747
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,422
He is the least likely to cause trouble

748
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:18,856
Nothing will go wrong

749
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,604
Handwritten by the late emperor

750
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,239
It's really rare

751
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:37,408
You should be able to sell it for a lot of money

752
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:39,544
This can also be sold

753
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:40,878
Someone will definitely collect it

754
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:44,982
It's not easy to take

755
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:45,783
It's not impossible

756
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:47,852
Go back and find a fake to hang up

757
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:52,256
Isn’t this just small talk?

758
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:53,991
Pay attention to your identity

759
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:54,892
We are now

760
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:56,527
After all, I am also a parent.

761
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,296
Evil Son

762
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,298
You want to piss me off

763
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:01,766
This is obviously what you said

764
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:02,600
You still talk back?

765
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,234
Go Go

766
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:04,569
Stop it

767
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:06,938
Go in first

768
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:08,806
make preparations

769
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,809
If Beihexing is really hiding in it

770
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:13,845
I'm afraid it's very hidden

771
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,413
Never easy to find

772
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:38,302
what to write

773
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:40,938
real or fake

774
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,206
What did you just say?

775
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,841
How can there be such a thing?

776
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,727
This little girl is not very old either

777
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,195
Willing to work in the kitchen

778
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:06,931
Pay off debts at home

779
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:08,499
It's not easy either

780
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,135
What about the job of the kitchen?

781
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:12,170
will you do it

782
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,671
I'm used to it all

783
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:15,473
That's good

784
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:17,975
This kitchen is too much work

785
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,343
I was saying there is a shortage of people

786
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:20,678
what to do

787
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,280
Just tell me directly

788
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:26,284
There's no water in the tank

789
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:27,451
Go get some water

790
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:28,519
Brush that pot

791
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:29,320
good

792
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:48,239
What's wrong? I can't carry it.

793
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:49,140
No

794
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:05,122
you just said

795
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:07,191
There are quite a lot of students in this academy.

796
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:08,526
That's quite a lot.

797
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,528
The daily food

798
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,796
I guess it's quite a lot.

799
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,098
This is delivered every morning

800
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,933
This is all our work

801
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,301
yard

802
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:19,203
What don’t you raise?

803
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:20,771
For example, chicken

804
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:22,607
Naturally, they are raised

805
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:25,343
No wonder I just saw one at the door

806
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:27,578
Did you see it

807
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,719
There are many scholars in this academy

808
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:36,921
Our chicken can't be outside

809
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:38,089
I have to go check it out

810
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:51,335
Uncle, do you know Beihexing?

811
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:03,414
What's the meaning

812
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:05,283
he can't hear

813
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:08,286
Who are you?

814
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:12,256
Dare to ask

815
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,158
Is this Mr. Wayne Wei?

816
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:18,963
it's me

817
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,098
Brother Wei, my surname is Yu

818
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:22,166
both students

819
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:23,768
He is also the Secretary of Zhaishe

820
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:24,835
Inside the house

821
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:25,603
One matter

822
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:26,671
You can tell me anything

823
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:29,006
Come, let me take Brother Wei to Zhaishe

824
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,409
You just said he couldn't hear you

825
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,178
Your Excellency is

826
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:36,213
this

827
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:37,682
It's the dog

828
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:39,984
Please also take care of Yu Sijian

829
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:41,852
You are his father

830
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,854
No, I'm not his father.

831
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:46,057
I am him

832
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:47,491
Father

833
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:52,763
The academy is rigorous in scholarship

834
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,999
The position of lecturer is not easy to arrange

835
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:57,835
We can only let Wang Kuan temporarily take charge of the book.

836
00:38:58,135 --> 00:38:59,804
Worked at Yushu Pavilion

837
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,238
Benefits are

838
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:02,039
No one restraint

839
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,040
Easy to move

840
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:21,726
I see

841
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,661
First the stepmother and then the stepfather

842
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:26,364
Although not biological

843
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:27,131
But at least

844
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:28,366
He is also our son

845
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,568
I just want to find a good way out for him

846
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:31,635
So I sent him to

847
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:32,903
This academy is here

848
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:35,039
Rest assured,

849
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:37,808
The academy has its own responsibility to teach and educate people

850
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:39,944
Zhou Shan has a long history of learning from ancient to modern times

851
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:42,813
I will definitely help your son to change his mind.

852
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:45,583
Who is this

853
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:46,751
book boy

854
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:52,490
It’s better to take it first

855
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,358
Mr. Wei went to settle down in his residence.

856
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:56,727
You just

857
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,396
Said he couldn't hear

858
00:39:59,363 --> 00:39:59,997
yes

859
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:01,732
If you are interested

860
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,167
Just put money on the table

861
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:04,568
The academy doesn't care

862
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,103
Elders from surrounding villages

863
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:07,338
Set up a stall here by yourself

864
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:09,540
Disaster in the village at the foot of the mountain

865
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,341
Mountain people have no way

866
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:12,343
Chief Zhou Shan said

867
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:13,911
As long as you don't enter the lecture hall

868
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:14,879
Not entering the house

869
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:16,080
harmless

870
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:18,716
How much money can you make from this?

871
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:21,118
What happened to Polaris?

872
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,654
Beihe is a star official

873
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:25,089
Affiliated to Jingjuku

874
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,323
I know this

875
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:27,792
I just want to ask

876
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:28,359
you know here

877
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:29,493
What are you selling?

878
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:31,862
This is not clear

879
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:32,997
I haven't bought it

880
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:34,999
How long has this stall been here?

881
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:36,100
This uncle comes often

882
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,168
Just keep it there

883
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:38,169
Isn't it?

884
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,072
Wayne

885
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,681
replace old with new

886
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:52,116
old number 210,000

887
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,051
Four thousand seven hundred and sixty four

888
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:55,352
The old number is 360,000

889
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:57,354
Eight thousand eight hundred and ninety seven

890
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,524
New number 3.86 million

891
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:02,326
Seven thousand nine hundred and forty

892
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:05,763
Old number fifty-three thousand nine hundred and seventy

893
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:09,200
New number fifty-five thousand five hundred and forty

894
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:12,002
The old number and the new number are all sixty

895
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:15,473
Pollux returns to its place

896
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:18,876
This sounds like some kind of calculation

897
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:21,412
I feel dizzy just listening to it

898
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:22,680
I don't understand either.

899
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:37,595
this

900
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:38,395
This is rich

901
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:40,097
I can’t bear such flowers either.

902
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:40,831
fine

903
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,099
It's not my money anyway

904
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:43,701
Just treat it as disaster relief

905
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:45,169
So pitiful

906
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,250
it's the same

907
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,852
It feels like some kind of puzzle

908
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,021
who knows

909
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,956
Maybe it's just written to deceive people.

910
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:09,326
Let's go

911
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:11,128
Send our son to Zhaishe first

912
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:14,565
Over there is the lecture hall.

913
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:16,567
The daily teaching sessions are all there

914
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,402
Go further inside Yushu Pavilion

915
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:20,337
Come to the Zhaishe

916
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:22,172
Most of the houses here are shared

917
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:23,941
Since Mr. Wei loves Jing,

918
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:24,975
Pay more

919
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:25,543
Yes

920
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,877
Arrange a separate room

921
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:28,312
only

922
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:30,381
It would be a waste to live alone

923
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:31,382
not alone

924
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:32,850
Even if you add the book boy

925
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:33,851
Only two people

926
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:34,852
We both live there too

927
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:37,321
I'm mainly worried.

928
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:39,657
Don't worry about him

929
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:41,091
Can I stay with him for a while?

930
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:43,127
There is precedent for this

931
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:45,329
I'm mainly worried about him.

932
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:49,533
Okay, it's just ahead.

933
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:51,569
Let's go

934
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:52,836
Gone Wayne

935
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:08,519
why are you here

936
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:10,287
How could it suddenly disappear?

937
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:15,459
What's wrong

938
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:16,193
Stop looking for it

939
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:17,728
What

940
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,698
Leave here and don't look for Pollux

941
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:21,699
have you met him

942
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:22,533
you at this moment

943
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:23,968
Shouldn't meet Pollux

944
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:25,235
Why

945
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:26,737
It's not you who are looking for him

946
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:28,138
It's him looking for you

947
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:30,808
I do not understand
