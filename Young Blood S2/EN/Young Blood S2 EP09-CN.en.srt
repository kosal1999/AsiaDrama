1
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,373
Which way to go next?

2
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,276
The post house is this way

3
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:58,518
what sound

4
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:06,893
Where does this lead to?

5
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,362
a village

6
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,698
Let's leave quickly

7
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:12,632
He sounded very nervous

8
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,902
Is this village far away?

9
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:17,337
Not far

10
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:19,439
It's not far

11
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,874
It has nothing to do with us

12
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:25,478
Going Around

13
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:27,280
Take a look

14
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,448
why

15
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,482
No sense

16
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:31,518
Taught by the Headmaster

17
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,653
Everything in the world may be related

18
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,654
Can not be ignored

19
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:36,689
What's the meaning

20
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:49,936
This road looks

21
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,171
No one has repaired it in a long time

22
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,373
It must be because the people in the village are too lazy

23
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:55,008
Let's go back

24
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,045
just in front

25
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,523
My son

26
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:15,662
Just say it

27
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:16,663
Weeping at the grave

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,535
Isn't this sacrifice put on display?

29
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:27,006
Son, my life is so miserable

30
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:29,809
How come so many people died?

31
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,213
This village is old

32
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,480
Maybe they're all buried here

33
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,983
These tombs look quite new.

34
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,119
The village should be right ahead

35
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,655
Go and have a look

36
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,460
Curiosity kills

37
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,206
Go go go go

38
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:22,528
this way

39
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:24,497
interesting

40
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:25,898
Look at horse hoof prints

41
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:27,834
It should be going to the right

42
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,837
This Yu Chiyuan has also learned to be smart.

43
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,438
He's still raising suspicions

44
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:33,840
It's not easy for him either.

45
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,275
We are surrounded by people

46
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,485
Already arrived at Jinghu South Road

47
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,821
Maybe it’s not far from Yuantian Pass

48
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:52,925
Look what I'm doing

49
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:54,560
Now that the mark has been found

50
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,695
let's go

51
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:57,930
gentlemen

52
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,966
We've all come this far

53
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:02,368
your chicken

54
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:03,736
Can you stop barking?

55
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,537
so

56
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,408
Tell it yourself

57
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,845
In fact, just don't let it open its mouth.

58
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:05,331
This specification

59
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,200
It definitely doesn’t look like a wild house.

60
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,402
This is the highest level post house

61
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,038
I set up a post office in the Song Dynasty

62
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,606
Such a standard inn

63
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,074
It must be built on the official road

64
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:17,210
Why are you in the mountains?

65
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:26,552
too quiet

66
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,117
What's going on here

67
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:00,086
There used to be a lot of people in this village.

68
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,564
There was no such thing before

69
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,575
Is this the person just now?

70
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:29,182
No sacrifice at the grave

71
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:30,983
Instead, it is used here

72
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:34,554
I see

73
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,123
This is the Dragon God

74
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,561
What happened to this village?

75
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:43,496
Maybe it's the dragon god appearing.

76
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:45,298
Set Tulong

77
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:46,399
What

78
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:47,767
Set Tulong

79
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,136
Sculpture dragons out of clay for worship

80
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,337
Usually used to pray for rain

81
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:52,638
how do you know

82
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:53,673
heard before

83
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,408
Use the method of earth dragon

84
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:56,776
There was it in the Han and Tang Dynasties

85
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,211
It has been circulating for a long time

86
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,112
It’s just that in our Song Dynasty

87
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,481
This method is rare

88
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:02,782
Basically use

89
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,050
How to draw a dragon to pray for rain

90
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,053
I've heard of dragon painting

91
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,721
soil

92
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,490
Three years of drought in Jingde

93
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:11,257
Useful

94
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,859
This is how to draw a dragon and pray for rain.

95
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:14,594
Then the earth dragon takes shape

96
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:15,795
Less and less

97
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:17,964
Maybe here in Tanzhou

98
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,198
Still using the old heritage

99
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:20,700
No, no, no, no

100
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:22,835
I was here two years ago

101
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,303
Absolutely not this

102
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:26,839
This village is not like that either.

103
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,040
It's really not right

104
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,977
Since ancient times, earth dragons have been worshiped

105
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:32,111
But never seen

106
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,613
Which one cut off the dragon's head?

107
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,215
Be careful

108
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:57,763
No one

109
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,501
It's normal that no one lives there

110
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:04,770
But even

111
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,472
There are no postmen or post officials.

112
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,674
It's very strange

113
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:16,582
Why are these all books?

114
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:30,329
Crap

115
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:31,998
What's wrong

116
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:34,433
This house is attacking me from all sides

117
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,542
I get a headache when I see the book

118
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,262
Yuan Zhongxin and others

119
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:04,530
We should have taken the fork on the right.

120
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:06,732
But why the mark

121
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,434
But they all stayed on the left side

122
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,136
The post house is the end point

123
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,003
That should be right

124
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:12,071
They go to the fork in the road

125
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:12,838
K

126
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,006
What happened temporarily?

127
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:16,976
is the enemy

128
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:19,578
probably not

129
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:22,448
No signs of struggle

130
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,016
So it’s not a big problem

131
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:31,424
This station

132
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:32,925
Looks like it's been abandoned for a long time

133
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,328
This inn is extraordinary

134
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:38,964
Such specifications look like

135
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,200
Like the old customs of the Chu people

136
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:49,775
There is something

137
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:52,878
What did you see?

138
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,553
There seems to be something in there

139
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,393
The dragon heads were cut off

140
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,761
How much I hate this dragon

141
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,396
Think about it the other way around

142
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:13,799
Plastic dragon prays for rain and then beheads and destroys eyes

143
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,202
Maybe he wanted to ruin the sacrifice

144
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:18,804
There's something missing here

145
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:20,773
Are there any sacrifices?

146
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,008
From a style point of view

147
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,677
It feels like a sacrifice

148
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,579
Sacrifice with the dragon

149
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:28,481
Is the thing very precious?

150
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,448
snatched away

151
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:30,683
this ceremony

152
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,418
Want to be sacrificed together with the dragon

153
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,220
unless

154
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,020
Unless something

155
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:37,890
Unless there's a real dragon inside

156
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,125
real dragon

157
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:41,393
Such a small box

158
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:42,528
Can pretend to be a dragon

159
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:44,396
There really is a dragon

160
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,631
have

161
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,133
There was in ancient times

162
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,434
Not just ancient times

163
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,568
The late emperor had it at that time

164
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:50,903
Let me think about it

165
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,338
The third year of Dazhong Xiangfu

166
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:53,639
Still four years ago

167
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,775
The late emperor sent his servant to find the real dragon

168
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,209
Made a prayer for rain

169
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,111
If your guess is correct

170
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:00,112
in a box

171
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,213
That should be it

172
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:04,650
Stop talking. Stop talking.

173
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:06,218
I figured it out.

174
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,020
You will know what

175
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,455
The truth is right before our eyes

176
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,457
Dragon statue damaged

177
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,458
Dragon God is angry

178
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,126
disaster from heaven

179
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,127
Village Finished

180
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:17,196
Not fluent

181
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:18,764
Is it reasonable?

182
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:21,700
I understand everything.

183
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:23,769
Let's go quickly

184
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:24,970
It's better to spend less time in this place

185
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,138
want to know the truth

186
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,339
Just ask if you can

187
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,474
Who to ask?

188
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:30,142
That old lady just now

189
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,011
It seems to be going in that direction

190
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,018
Has she always been this bold?

191
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:40,252
Aren't you curious?

192
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:43,022
Ask less about gods and Buddhas

193
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,090
In case you encounter something strange

194
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,459
It's not something we mere mortals can control.

195
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,128
Even if it was caused by gods and Buddhas

196
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:50,729
That also needs to be taken care of

197
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,132
What did you say

198
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,196
It's a mouse

199
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,999
Rat in clothes

200
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,801
It's for children to play with

201
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:30,903
no

202
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:33,339
This mouse costume

203
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,573
Not the dress of this dynasty

204
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,009
So what are you wearing?

205
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:44,783
Han Dynasty clothing

206
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:48,888
Not a mouse

207
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:51,657
It's evil

208
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,369
People found

209
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,537
Just in the village

210
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,072
Opened his mouth

211
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,008
Silent at first

212
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,676
Just leave some money and let's talk.

213
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:11,810
Where is the family?

214
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:13,312
Almost dead

215
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,080
living people

216
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,015
They all fled

217
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:16,982
What happened

218
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,384
I'll make a long story short

219
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,119
This village suffered a disaster

220
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:21,086
drought

221
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,088
Not only the disease

222
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,363
Not that scary

223
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,898
The epidemic has passed

224
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:39,204
Praying for rain

225
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:40,739
It is also a way to eliminate disasters

226
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:42,241
It seems

227
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,475
Didn't succeed

228
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,077
Drought is rampant

229
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:46,578
disease outbreak

230
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,214
Most of the people fled

231
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:50,983
Only the old people are left

232
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,218
Almost starved to death

233
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,020
Then use food as a sacrifice

234
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,323
It is said that some villain broke the dragon statue

235
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,325
So all the disasters

236
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,260
Because of this, they are all out of control

237
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,729
They just want to worship devoutly

238
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,130
Ask the Dragon God for mercy

239
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,599
What's there to worship an earth dragon?

240
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:08,801
Separate Separate

241
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:09,768
Don't talk nonsense

242
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:10,636
Pah pah pah

243
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:12,972
Who cut off the leader?

244
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,373
Students from Yuelu Academy

245
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:15,474
Wollu Academy

246
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:17,876
Aren’t they all scholars?

247
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,713
Why do scholars destroy dragon statues?

248
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,314
Are you bringing disaster to the world?

249
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,317
Why do students want to behead dragons?

250
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:28,554
It doesn't make sense

251
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:33,092
The luggage and clothes are all there.

252
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:36,495
People can't disappear into thin air

253
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:37,963
broken

254
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,734
What's wrong? What are you doing?

255
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:43,502
I want to put it out

256
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:45,204
it is aware

257
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:46,138
What's wrong?

258
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,141
Are you crazy

259
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,610
Chickens will sense something is wrong

260
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:52,678
Then you suddenly

261
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,712
Why did you let it out?

262
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:56,482
It's going to poop

263
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,485
There is a hole in my basket

264
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,353
Shit has been leaking out of me these past two days.

265
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,021
we want to be here

266
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,255
Been here for a while

267
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:05,524
Let it out and move it around

268
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,497
What if Yu Chiyuan sees it?

269
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,499
Is there any problem with raising chickens in the post house?

270
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:17,369
No

271
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,011
Yanei

272
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:27,780
what is that

273
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,021
have no idea

274
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:38,957
Someone is worshiping this thing

275
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,737
Is there such a strange snail in the world?

276
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,238
Definitely not

277
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,040
Who would worship a conch?

278
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,543
then what is it

279
00:17:58,644 --> 00:17:59,478
Don't understand

280
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:00,712
Ask Wang Kuan

281
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,449
Wang Kuan may not know everything

282
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,453
i know what this is

283
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,354
look

284
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:10,856
What did I say?

285
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,358
It's just as evil as this one

286
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:14,860
It seems like this

287
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:16,728
There should be more than just these two

288
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:17,863
besides

289
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:18,730
besides

290
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:25,137
There is no one at the inn

291
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:26,605
But find these two things

292
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,007
Someone set up an altar to offer sacrifices

293
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:44,123
really

294
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:45,591
Is there any more?

295
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:46,959
Gone

296
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,661
We also found it here

297
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:51,663
its not right

298
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:53,432
There should be one more

299
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:55,434
Where will it be?

300
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,075
Don't think too much about it

301
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:04,543
The village is so close to the inn

302
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:05,244
Academy people

303
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:06,578
Why destroy the dragon statue?

304
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,247
Mr. Yuan may know the reason

305
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,119
that is not

306
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,493
Chicken?

307
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,368
Common things that happen when raising chickens and ducks in a post house

308
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:30,769
What's all the fuss about?

309
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,205
I have little knowledge

310
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:38,844
Is the cock's mouth tied?

311
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,485
Why tie the chicken's mouth?

312
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:50,756
Yes

313
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:52,558
why

314
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:53,792
Understood

315
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,895
Mr. Yuan thinks it's noisy

316
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,463
So I tied it up

317
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,633
Then why keep it?

318
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:06,605
Eat to gain weight

319
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:08,607
This is not simple

320
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:10,375
so smart

321
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,210
Never mind it

322
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,377
Mr. Yuan

323
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,279
They won't run into your father, right?

324
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,847
Let’s see what surprise I bring you

325
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:17,015
Mr. Yuan

326
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:18,317
gentlemen

327
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:21,019
Mr. Yuan

328
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:24,957
Where are the people?

329
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:26,992
There's no way there's no one there

330
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,462
Brother, don't worry

331
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,763
Let's find it together

332
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:33,565
Mr. Yuan

333
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:37,569
gentlemen

334
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:40,539
Sir

335
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:44,543
gentlemen

336
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:01,493
what sound

337
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,928
anyone there

338
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:04,263
no one

339
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,598
no one

340
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:18,043
The posthouse is empty

341
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,451
send him away

342
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:35,761
What a ghost

343
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,332
Why is there no one?

344
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,605
Have you found anything there?

345
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:48,640
Indeed no one

346
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:52,711
Could it be that this dragon's head has been cut off?

347
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:54,179
It affects here

348
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,082
It's possible.

349
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,084
Not far away after all

350
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:00,719
If you want to say so

351
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,522
Aren't we also in danger?

352
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,090
It's so possible

353
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,958
The faucet is broken and you still touch it?

354
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:08,727
In this yard

355
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:10,495
There are no heads left either.

356
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:11,496
Excuse me then

357
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,432
what do we do

358
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:15,834
How can we eliminate the crisis?

359
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,002
yes

360
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,004
what should we do

361
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:21,206
I see

362
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,076
Worship sincerely

363
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:25,711
Please forgive me Dragon God

364
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:27,713
As long as you sincerely offer sacrifices

365
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:29,715
Maybe we can save the day

366
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,616
Is there such a good way?

367
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:33,618
Why didn't I think of that?

368
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:34,553
yes

369
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:35,454
We still

370
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:36,021
Not as good as

371
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,055
Mr. Yuchi

372
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:38,123
far-reaching wisdom

373
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,692
Can't say that either

374
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:42,728
Everyone has their own strengths

375
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:44,596
I'm just good at thinking

376
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:45,497
Then this will be easy to handle

377
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:46,131
Let's find someone to go back to

378
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:46,965
Just light some incense

379
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:47,599
OK

380
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:48,500
I go

381
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:50,001
OK

382
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:50,969
Then we'll wait for you here

383
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:52,003
Go quickly and come back soon

384
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:53,205
etc.

385
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:56,341
you know

386
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:57,609
How to burn incense and worship?

387
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:58,777
of course I know

388
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:00,645
Isn’t it just to bow and burn incense?

389
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,381
How can that be done?

390
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:03,849
If you are not sincere

391
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,384
Might even anger the Dragon God

392
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,052
Makes sense

393
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,620
Then let's find someone who is sincere

394
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,354
Go with him

395
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:10,355
Then I'll go.

396
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:13,091
You can forget it.

397
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:14,559
You just go

398
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,394
if not

399
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:17,295
I just washed my face this morning

400
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:18,697
You didn't even wash up

401
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:20,298
dirty

402
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:21,933
How to worship God

403
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:26,238
dirty

404
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:29,274
Can't you be sincere?

405
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:41,286
This is the attitude

406
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:45,090
never mind

407
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:46,792
None of you can do this

408
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:49,494
Look at it this way

409
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,263
I need to take him for a trip

410
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:53,331
Who else would I be?

411
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,341
He said I was dirty

412
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,677
Let's go wash up

413
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:19,257
People left

414
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:20,792
How did you let him go?

415
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,060
Went to worship the dragon

416
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:23,094
Bailong

417
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:24,496
Let’s talk about the key points first

418
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:25,363
Yu Chiyuan said

419
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:27,232
Yuantian Pass is in this post house

420
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:29,434
But there is no one in this posthouse

421
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:30,735
Any vision?

422
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:31,503
have

423
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:37,976
What's this

424
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,578
It feels a bit familiar

425
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,049
Just four?

426
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:45,717
Is there one missing?

427
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:48,253
Wang Kuan also said there is another one

428
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:49,554
You know this thing

429
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:50,555
Of course

430
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:51,556
Old thieves and the others

431
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:53,091
I believe these ghosts and gods the most

432
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:55,694
This is called Five Elements Evil

433
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:58,563
No wonder it looks familiar

434
00:24:58,563 --> 00:24:59,731
Saw it in books

435
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,901
Disasters in the world are divided into five elements

436
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:05,303
This is Huang Yi soil

437
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:06,771
Late Han Dynasty and Three Kingdoms Period

438
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:07,739
Someone from Wei has seen it

439
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,975
Spoken words determine life and death

440
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:13,211
This is just one of the earth-type evils

441
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:14,479
There are also formless and formless

442
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,715
It is said that when Emperor Zhaolie of the Han Dynasty conquered Wu

443
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,517
When I met in Zigui, the ground was filled with yellow air.

444
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,484
Stretching for more than ten miles

445
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:20,952
That's also Huang Wei's vision

446
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,654
Then came the great defeat of Yiling

447
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,489
So Yiling was defeated

448
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:24,923
Because of

449
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:26,191
Emperor Zhaolie meets Xie Yi

450
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:28,460
It's ominous.

451
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:31,263
It's just far-fetched

452
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:32,197
All major events

453
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,732
Always looking for some so-called secrets

454
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:35,000
In fact, there is no evil

455
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,334
All heaven’s secrets are determined by man

456
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:37,969
However, some people would rather believe

457
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:39,170
These evil theories

458
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,406
I don’t want to believe that everything is man-made

459
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,242
What about the others?

460
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,481
This is the turtle tree

461
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:50,649
right

462
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,251
I found this in a tree hole

463
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:55,921
Isn't this a snail?

464
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:57,022
What do you call a turtle?

465
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:59,257
In ancient times, snails were classified as turtles

466
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,960
It is said that Jin minister Wei Guan saw this object

467
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,395
The following year, Wei Guan's family of nine

468
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:04,930
Then he was killed by people sent by Empress Jia

469
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,298
So this thing

470
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,532
Represents the disaster of weapons

471
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:09,734
Bad luck

472
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,672
Wei Guan's death stemmed from Empress Jia's abuse of power

473
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:14,539
Nothing to do with this

474
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:17,375
Caterpillar's evil is metal

475
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,277
Nanyang appeared during the reign of Emperor Wu of Jin Dynasty

476
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:20,879
After that, the royal family was in chaos

477
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:22,013
The world is in turmoil

478
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:26,017
Chi Yi belongs to fire

479
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:28,720
When Gongsun Yuan claimed to be King of Yan

480
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,921
Xiangping appeared

481
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,023
After that, the Wei army captured Xiangping

482
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:33,058
Liaodong Pingding

483
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:34,159
Disaster of the Five Elements

484
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,160
Jin Wei becomes a monster

485
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,161
Wood is auspicious

486
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:37,329
Earth is a disaster

487
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:38,496
Fire is a disaster

488
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:41,333
Metal, wood, earth, and fire still lack water.

489
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,301
Water is a disaster

490
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,804
Four have been found now

491
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:48,006
It feels like the fifth one is coming soon.

492
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:49,641
I've looked for it twice.

493
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:52,844
I found this in a tree hole

494
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,279
Xiaojing, which one is yours?

495
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,581
Huang Yi is the earth

496
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:57,983
Found it in a stone statue

497
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:00,452
One is offering sacrifices by the stove

498
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:02,087
There is a weapon in a house

499
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:04,723
Fire and Gold

500
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:07,692
That water

501
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,494
Could it be in the pond?

502
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,329
possible

503
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:12,797
Have to look for

504
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:15,400
I still need to find all these things.

505
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,636
But these things

506
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,237
They are all images of disaster

507
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:20,739
Affiliated to Xieyi

508
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,574
Who will come to worship?

509
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:23,441
yes

510
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:24,809
How unlucky

511
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,511
Not as good as

512
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,583
Xiao Lu Zhangyuan said something

513
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:33,351
After all, this journey

514
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:34,653
It was you who brought us here

515
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:35,820
Presumably Xiaolu Zhangyuan

516
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,255
More enlightened than us

517
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:42,727
do something

518
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:43,995
Pushing the envelope

519
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,096
wasting time

520
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:46,965
Let's find a pond first.

521
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,008
Did you bring any sacrifices?

522
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,043
What do you think?

523
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:00,645
That's inappropriate

524
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,280
Can't be empty-handed

525
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:03,915
I have to go get something

526
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,751
Knives cannot be used as sacrifices

527
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:07,719
Meat is best

528
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,055
The faucet is gone

529
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:18,997
who is there

530
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,498
If there is anyone in this village

531
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:21,332
If you stay

532
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:22,434
Must be very pious

533
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,235
You shouldn't dare to touch this

534
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,738
you mean

535
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:28,339
something has been here

536
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:33,011
who

537
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,781
What happened?

538
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:40,452
Maybe I'm seeing things.

539
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,320
What did you see?

540
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:44,522
Just behind that

541
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:46,458
A dragon flashed across

542
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:48,059
Dragon shape

543
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:51,896
Could it be

544
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:53,031
The true dragon appears

545
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:55,500
It flashed by and I didn’t see clearly

546
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:03,742
Don't get me wrong

547
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,276
We didn't break your head

548
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,047
This is bad

549
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:10,882
What if this confuses my mind?

550
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,884
It would be bad if he got possessed again.

551
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:15,153
Or we

552
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:25,930
Who goes down

553
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,573
The hero volunteered

554
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,011
The time has come

555
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:43,915
I have to feed the chickens

556
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:47,552
If I had known I would have raised something

557
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:48,920
As early as in front of the secret pavilion

558
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,155
Didn’t you have two dogs?

559
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,723
What kind of dog is it? Is it cute?

560
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:54,459
Five elements of disaster

561
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:55,193
maybe with

562
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:56,594
The whereabouts of Yuantianguan are connected

563
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,164
Just this pond

564
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:00,698
It's really dirty

565
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:07,071
Otherwise, you can look for it again.

566
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:07,539
Are there any other

567
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:08,540
Clean pond

568
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:09,674
Makes sense

569
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:12,277
If you want to do big things, you still have to be afraid of getting dirty.

570
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:14,078
The Chief

571
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:20,718
Change over time

572
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,154
How can we look forward and backward?

573
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:55,687
I thought about it again

574
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:57,455
In fact, the last one is as disastrous as

575
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,424
Not necessarily in the pond

576
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:03,494
Didn’t you say that the last one is water?

577
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:05,163
It’s true that it belongs to water

578
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,232
But look around this pool

579
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:08,333
no altar

580
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:10,635
The remaining four disasters were sacrificed

581
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:11,536
Then if the last one

582
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,537
In this water

583
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:13,872
How to offer incense and worship?

584
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:16,274
Yuan Zhongxin, what you said makes sense.

585
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:18,176
I knew it

586
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:19,344
Impossible in a pond

587
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,285
Is there any other place

588
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:28,219
Didn't notice

589
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:30,488
words related to water

590
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:32,257
water tank teapot

591
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:35,059
Didn't you tell me earlier?

592
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:37,528
Xiao Lu Zhangyuan works

593
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:39,731
I'm a little too anxious.

594
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,250
Don't worry, Commander

595
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:00,952
Look everywhere again

596
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,654
It can't be in a pond anyway

597
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:04,088
Dean

598
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:04,889
Come

599
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:06,391
Headmaster, be careful

600
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:12,664
There are fish on the roof

601
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:14,632
Do you want to take a look?

602
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:17,735
There are fish on the roof

603
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:19,537
Drying salted fish?

604
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:04,115
It's all done now

605
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,021
Why on the roof?

606
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:11,756
There is no water on the roof again

607
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:14,125
Are you waiting for rain?

608
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:15,860
This is fish evil

609
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,162
Fish are born in the abyss and thrive in the house

610
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,764
It is extremely yin covering yang

611
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:21,132
Lord evil and disaster

612
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:22,934
During the reign of King Wei Qi

613
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:24,302
Then there is this image in the world

614
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:26,371
That year there was the defeat of Dongguan

615
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:27,772
okay

616
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,240
The five evil elements are gathered together

617
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,074
Then what

618
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,175
No or I don’t know

619
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,276
Where is Yuantianguan?

620
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:34,479
at least we know

621
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:35,980
What was he worshiping?

622
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,181
And also know

623
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:39,617
who are the people around him

624
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:47,091
There's something underneath the fish

625
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:48,192
Then why don't you take it down?

626
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,128
If you don't take it off, it means you can't take it.

627
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:50,928
correct

628
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,400
Xixia Sacrifice

629
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,436
Sheep Guardian

630
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:44,449
What is the Goat God?

631
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:47,251
It is the god worshipped by the Xixia people.

632
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,255
Yuan Tianguan betrayed

633
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,290
There is a Xixia man next to me

634
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,257
It's normal

635
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,359
Xixia people feared ghosts and gods

636
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:57,929
Even the changes in the sky are awe-inspiring

637
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:58,963
So worship this

638
00:34:59,063 --> 00:34:59,964
Not surprising

639
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,101
That makes sense

640
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:05,236
But he didn't come here

641
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:06,671
The whereabouts of Pollux?

642
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,840
But why don't you get down to business?

643
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,842
Should we let the Xixia people do this?

644
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:12,477
Think differently

645
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:13,778
This disaster

646
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:14,912
Since you are not from Xixia

647
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:16,013
Worshiped

648
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,049
Then why do Xixia people use

649
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,383
How to worship the Sheep Guardian God

650
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:20,451
Come to worship it

651
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,654
Fear of disaster

652
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,157
Use Xixia gods to suppress

653
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:29,894
fear of suppression

654
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:31,929
Yuantianguan and Xixia people

655
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:33,531
Not getting along well

656
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:35,233
You mean they're fighting among themselves?

657
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:40,204
They left the inn

658
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,140
This is also the reason

659
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,378
Where is Yuchiyuan?

660
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:49,514
Something unexpected happened

661
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,448
What an accident

662
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:52,083
The faucet is gone

663
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,118
It's the broken faucet

664
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:55,453
right

665
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:57,755
Yu Chiyuan noticed something was wrong

666
00:35:57,855 --> 00:35:58,723
Chased into the jungle

667
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:00,925
I didn't catch up and the person disappeared.

668
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:04,529
What is this situation?

669
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:06,397
Could it be

670
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:07,498
yuantianguan

671
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:09,767
Then we have to check it out.

672
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:13,471
But we haven’t finished searching here yet.

673
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:15,673
I'll go check it out.

674
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:19,277
thank you

675
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:23,314
No need to say thank you

676
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:25,883
I'm just curious

677
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:27,919
That's thanks too

678
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:32,523
I said you're welcome

679
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,258
Go south to Tanzhou

680
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:36,294
The friendship between you and me has become clear

681
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:38,763
What will I do next

682
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:40,531
It has nothing to do with Xiaolu Zhangyuan

683
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:51,075
Actually I think

684
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:52,443
You can't blame the dead uncle.

685
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:54,712
after all

686
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:56,414
He who keeps company with the good becomes good.

687
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:58,883
He who is near mud is mud

688
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,021
Xiao Lu Zhangyuan's body

689
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:04,822
It really makes people

690
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:07,258
Not easy to get close to

691
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:08,960
Everyone

692
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,894
Xiaolu Zhangyuan

693
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:11,729
Don't take it too seriously

694
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:14,298
This person Yuan Zhongxin

695
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:15,766
Just a little out of tune

696
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:24,141
Set here

697
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:24,675
Dean

698
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:26,277
Let's change clothes

699
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:33,217
There must be something hidden here

700
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:34,051
other clues

701
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:35,720
Please continue searching

702
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,255
Don't be impetuous

703
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:39,624
Follow the teachings of Xiao Lu Zhangyuan

704
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,442
Where is Yuchiyuan?

705
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,343
Knocked out

706
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:00,645
I won't wake up for a while

707
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:01,779
Where is the person hiding?

708
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,481
In the woods next to the post house

709
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:04,482
tied up

710
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:06,450
look

711
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:08,452
Poems and essays by students in the state

712
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,354
They are all books printed by Tanzhou itself.

713
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:19,530
so what

714
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:22,900
Avoid Lu Nanshan

715
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:23,834
Call everyone together

716
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,102
The chief has gone

717
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:28,272
What are you looking at?

718
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:32,410
Chief

719
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,279
Are there any other clues in this yard?

720
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,281
Lu Nanshan asked us to search

721
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:38,683
Let's help him find it

722
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:42,720
I just saw

723
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,821
something passed

724
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,458
I seem to have seen it too

725
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:48,492
right

726
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:51,529
It should be in a stone box

727
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:52,763
The lost dragon

728
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:54,332
What a real dragon?

729
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,102
There is a stone box in front of the dragon statue in the village

730
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:00,037
The real dragon inside ran away

731
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:01,772
Are you serious

732
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:04,975
It's the right thing to be here

733
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:06,877
what is right

734
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:21,692
Come

735
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,060
Come and see the real dragon

736
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,076
Chief, you lied to me

737
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:40,211
This is a lizard

738
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,580
Also called Xiaolong

739
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:45,049
real or fake

740
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:47,518
During the reign of Dazhong Xiangfu

741
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:48,719
The late emperor sent his servant

742
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,020
Go to Maoshan to find the real dragon

743
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,255
This is what I'm looking for

744
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:53,257
I found two and ran away with one.

745
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:53,924
After praying for rain

746
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:54,792
Sent back again

747
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:55,793
Run so far

748
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:56,794
Catching lizards

749
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,763
This method existed in the Tang Dynasty

750
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,297
The emperor believed it.

751
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:01,832
At that time, it was Yang Yi’s book

752
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:03,100
This is what is recommended

753
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,602
Lizard's Rain Prayer

754
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:06,137
Yang Wengong

755
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:07,438
Yang Wengong opposed it all his life

756
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,807
The late emperor built buildings and sought immortality

757
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,841
I was praying for rain

758
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,276
They want to carry out large-scale construction projects

759
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:13,844
As a result, he recommended this method

760
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:15,112
It did save a lot of money

761
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:15,813
In the end, people

762
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:16,781
Just a trip

763
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:18,716
You said that even officials believe in ghosts and gods?

764
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:20,084
Not to mention the people

765
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:21,886
Officials all believe

766
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:23,754
Will it be really useful?

767
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,796
The real dragon was eaten by the chicken

768
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,298
This is the god they believe in

769
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:35,332
etc.

770
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:37,168
This lizard

771
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:38,702
He was brought back from the village

772
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:41,172
The five disasters of the dragon statue are related to each other

773
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,807
The disappearance of Yuantian Pass

774
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,608
It should be inseparable from these

775
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:45,209
You just now

776
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:46,177
That's not what you said

777
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:49,113
You said that inference just now?

778
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:49,814
A set of

779
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,815
That makes sense.

780
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:53,517
all wrong

781
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:56,053
Tell it to Lu Nanshan

782
00:40:57,321 --> 00:40:58,255
Or our office

783
00:40:58,255 --> 00:40:59,557
Look carefully for clues

784
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:01,859
no

785
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:03,160
What you just said

786
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,328
It's all wrong

787
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:06,330
It sounds pretty reliable to me.

788
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,200
Are you saying that the Xixia people were affected by disasters?

789
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,434
Internal strife with Yuan Tianguan

790
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,370
That's all bullshit.

791
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,739
Yuantianguan surrendered to Xixia

792
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:16,674
Belongs to a surrendered general

793
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:17,975
If the Xixia people were because of

794
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,043
Words of disaster and dissatisfaction

795
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:20,377
Just do it directly

796
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:21,479
Why bother

797
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,713
What statue of a goat guardian should you draw?

798
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,820
But we all believed it

799
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,322
Actually I don't believe it

800
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:33,457
Why

801
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:34,258
Just now

802
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:35,960
When they are talking about this

803
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,595
Brother Wang pulled my sleeve

804
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:38,529
And shook his head

805
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:38,996
I knew it

806
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,297
Can't believe what they say

807
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:43,567
You pull her sleeve

808
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,370
Already so familiar

809
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:48,739
As soon as I heard it, I knew it was nonsense.

810
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:49,940
then why do you

811
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,041
Don't pull my sleeve.

812
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:52,943
unwilling

813
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:54,278
Everyone is a vegetarian

814
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:55,980
What's the difference between me and Xiaojing?

815
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:00,017
You are so unfaithful

816
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,419
What you said is a bit too much.

817
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:12,730
I'm just talking

818
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:14,965
It doesn't matter

819
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,835
Those evil things

820
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:19,203
Is there another explanation?

821
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,038
Not just an explanation

822
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,072
maybe we can know

823
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:23,440
Where did Yuantian Pass go?

824
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:24,808
No way

825
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:27,511
change direction

826
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:29,647
Think about Yuantianguan coming to Tanzhou

827
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:30,915
what is his purpose

828
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:34,285
adult

829
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:35,152
Will it

830
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:36,921
Yuan Tianguan noticed something was wrong in advance

831
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,255
Just ran away

832
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:41,058
This trip south

833
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,326
Why few people know

834
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:43,561
Just afraid of leaks

835
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:46,063
Yuan Tianguan

836
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,032
Will it be unpredictable?

837
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,834
Here in Tanzhou

838
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:52,536
There should be troops stationed there, right?

839
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:54,038
More than Xiangjun

840
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:56,874
Tanzhou is a stronghold in Xiangling

841
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,410
It has been a battleground for military strategists since ancient times.

842
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:02,813
Under the Imperial Guard

843
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:05,115
The main camp of the Guiyuan Army is in Tanzhou

844
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:08,652
Your Excellency is the Head of the Secret Pavilion

845
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:10,454
It’s another deputy commission of the Privy Council.

846
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:13,023
Why don't we use the Imperial Army to investigate this place?

847
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:15,693
You are not unaware of our dynasty's system.

848
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:18,062
Military commander

849
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:20,531
All are civil servants

850
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,434
Want to borrow troops in a big way

851
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,136
Impossible

852
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:29,673
Obviously working

853
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:32,409
How could it be so difficult

854
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:34,445
This is why

855
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:35,646
i will let you

856
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,014
Contact Han Duanzhang

857
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:41,051
My late father and I have never had the same ideas.

858
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:42,519
But this is the only thing

859
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:44,054
I've always been behind you

860
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,323
Just want to take advantage of the war

861
00:43:46,323 --> 00:43:48,492
Reversing the situation of the wealthy and the powerful

862
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:52,096
It's a pity that the success failed

863
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,633
After the Liao-Xia war, both sides suffered losses

864
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,702
In recent years, I have wanted to use the military again.

865
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:05,809
unless

866
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:07,611
Unless something

867
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:11,982
Yuan Zhongxin said

868
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:14,752
Sooner or later Yuan Hao will raise another army

869
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:15,552
What do you think

870
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:18,422
Yuan Hao should be this kind of person

871
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:22,059
Qizhai kills Yuan Hao

872
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:24,361
As a secret agent of the Song Dynasty

873
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:25,696
It's natural

874
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:29,733
But as long as Yuan Hao is not dead

875
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:31,835
There will be war in the future

876
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:37,574
A military commander wants to gain fame

877
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:40,411
Still need to rely on war

878
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:43,514
Many people will die

879
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:48,452
Everyone is mortal.

880
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:51,955
But if your mind is as strong as iron

881
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:54,091
Why be afraid of blood flowing into a river?
