1
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:10,763
Your Highness

2
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,831
Everyone is here

3
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:16,836
very good

4
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,351
It's almost time

5
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:35,555
Ready to kill

6
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,094
remember

7
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,731
I am waiting for King Qin to escort you.

8
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,003
Revenge for Qingtianzi

9
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:26,839
You go down

10
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,142
yes

11
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,637
about there

12
00:03:58,972 --> 00:03:59,606
Walk

13
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,849
Yuan Zhongxin and Wu Zangying Pang

14
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,083
Didn't you come to answer the call?

15
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,962
Qing Tianzi is in danger

16
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,331
Kill the thieves

17
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:00,600
Save my father

18
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,081
My son is filial

19
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,783
It’s really touching.

20
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,618
Not even for a moment

21
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:19,752
separate from me

22
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:25,992
stop looking

23
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,093
By seniority

24
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:28,561
You have to call me mother now

25
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,782
Sons and ministers heard

26
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,484
He didn't hide anything and blackmailed Pang to cause trouble.

27
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:52,418
Came in a hurry

28
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,220
Keep your father and king safe

29
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:57,156
real

30
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:00,293
otherwise

31
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:03,363
How dare I bring a sword to see you?

32
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,301
I always believe in my son

33
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:09,969
Come

34
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:12,572
Come closer

35
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,074
You and I, father and son, are united in our hearts

36
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:16,743
let's go out together

37
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,211
Kill the rebels

38
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:30,690
Why don't you come over?

39
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,398
There is no hiding the traitor Pang

40
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,766
He actually killed his father

41
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,602
I swear to God

42
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,705
This beast must be killed

43
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,341
To avenge my father's death

44
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,476
Come in and escort

45
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,208
The prince is drunk

46
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,043
Send the prince back to rest.

47
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:58,544
yes

48
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:18,898
do not worry

49
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,399
Brother Ning Ling doesn’t know

50
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,601
It was you who made his every move

51
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:22,501
told me

52
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,437
I only hope that the Qingtianzi will give it to the Yeli clan

53
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:25,338
a chance

54
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:26,739
Of course

55
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,174
I promised you

56
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,076
Give the Yeli clan a future

57
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:31,344
me

58
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,879
Always keep your word

59
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:37,850
No hidden lies

60
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,918
arrange escort

61
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,119
Arrange a banquet

62
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:40,853
No change

63
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:41,854
Not really

64
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:46,893
Call him over

65
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:47,860
yes

66
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,054
I have seen the Qingtianzi

67
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,622
Have you ever seen the imperial concubine?

68
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:20,593
Drank too much

69
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,195
I am terrified

70
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,831
Did you see the corpse outside?

71
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,667
They are all traitors

72
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,068
Minister dereliction of duty

73
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,271
It has nothing to do with you

74
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:33,773
The prince's handwriting

75
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,176
divine punishment

76
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,878
Turmoil in the court

77
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,947
Then I ask myself

78
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:44,517
If I want to kill myself

79
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,185
What's the best time

80
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:50,423
Of course now

81
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,892
Now in the palace

82
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,560
who can be closest to me

83
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,663
Of course she is the newly married princess

84
00:09:58,664 --> 00:09:59,732
People who want to kill me

85
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,400
I need this wedding

86
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,036
Then I will give them this big wedding

87
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:08,874
I thought

88
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,109
That girl from Song Dynasty

89
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,911
Will I change the bride?

90
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,379
Princess's Guard

91
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,514
I have always been the one arranging it.

92
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,016
How do they change it?

93
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,551
So the Prime Minister

94
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,453
You have lived up to my trust

95
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,256
I have no second thoughts

96
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,025
It is even more impossible to be with those Song people

97
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:26,759
Cooperation

98
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,261
Believe it now

99
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,196
Get up

100
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,035
What a pity, Prince.

101
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:37,737
Didn't pass this level

102
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,872
Over there with the prince

103
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:42,441
The position of the prince cannot be moved lightly

104
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,580
these days

105
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,148
punish god

106
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,017
Move it to the prince

107
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,153
The prince is immoral

108
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,255
Only then did he attract the wrath of the gods

109
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:57,890
accumulate some public grievances

110
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,091
Destroy him again

111
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,894
Qingtianzi's methods of governing the country

112
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,162
breathtaking

113
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:04,797
tell your sister

114
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,198
put her at ease

115
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:08,234
her son

116
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,069
I will take the place of Brother Ning Ling

117
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,072
Xie Qingtianzi

118
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,574
Okay, go down quickly.

119
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,076
My wedding is not over yet

120
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,477
Yes Yes Yes

121
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:19,779
yes

122
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:45,304
Yuan Hao actually

123
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,906
be prepared

124
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,080
Yuan Hao used his weapons to appear and disappear

125
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:55,347
very smart

126
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,416
Last night's assassination was a great opportunity

127
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:58,551
all we can think of

128
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,785
He can also think of

129
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:00,986
so

130
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,655
You didn't change your identity

131
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:03,656
Think about it now

132
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:04,690
It's right to be careful

133
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:06,258
Be careful

134
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,360
But he didn’t tell Brother Ning Ling

135
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:10,563
Prime Minister, look at the current situation

136
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:12,098
Brother Ning Ling wants to kill him

137
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,532
It's not just Yuan Hao

138
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:15,401
you

139
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:16,268
I

140
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:17,937
He won't let it go

141
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,338
After this incident

142
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:20,072
Yuan Hao should

143
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,440
I trust the Prime Minister more

144
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:23,876
After these days

145
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:24,877
Assassination

146
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,278
But there is no chance

147
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,781
Wait a little longer

148
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:29,815
What are you waiting for?

149
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:31,016
Waiting for transfer

150
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,754
This is the situation now

151
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,158
Will there be any turning point?

152
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:04,517
As long as people live

153
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,952
It’s not the end yet

154
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,427
What are you panicking about?

155
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,464
It’s come to this point

156
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,834
The building is about to collapse

157
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,536
Life in the World

158
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,338
There are always more setbacks than good times

159
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,374
you have to remember

160
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,743
Only Death

161
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,978
Can really defeat you

162
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,586
Hope you give me a chance

163
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,322
Let me go back to Xingqing Mansion

164
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,625
Then I can still gather the old troops

165
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,897
How are you still alive?

166
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,736
Yuan Hao imprisoned us in the dungeon

167
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,238
There was no way to survive

168
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:33,439
But I never expected it

169
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,274
Those Song boys sneaked into the dungeon

170
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,842
rescued me

171
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,211
Yuan Zhongxin and others

172
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,679
And the Prime Minister secretly helps

173
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,781
What do they want to do?

174
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:47,653
Everything was ruined by them

175
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:50,322
Brother Ning Ling

176
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,258
Don't be anxious

177
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:05,671
where are they

178
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,874
Qizhai asked me to bring a message to His Highness

179
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:09,875
explain

180
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,810
say what

181
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,980
Said His Highness is too murderous

182
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,015
Wedding

183
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:16,882
Not only to kill Yuan Hao

184
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:18,017
Also kill Qizhai

185
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,718
They are grateful

186
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,023
So they are afraid, right?

187
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,593
They don't dare to take action, right?

188
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:28,894
they said

189
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:30,996
Yuan Hao still wants to be killed

190
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:37,303
I'm like this

191
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:38,337
How else to kill?

192
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,638
That Yuan Zhongxin said

193
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:40,673
There is still a transfer

194
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,474
Where did this turn of events come from?

195
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:45,778
newspaper

196
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:48,948
newspaper

197
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:50,783
Qingtianzi

198
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:51,550
Emergency report from the army

199
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:52,651
Hurry up and hurry up

200
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:53,986
Youzhou Military Supervisory Department mobilizes cavalry

201
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,120
Now close to leaving the palace

202
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:56,522
Youzhou Army

203
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,358
Liang Gewei's daughter

204
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:03,562
Headquarters Cavalry

205
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:04,797
Already close to Helan Mountain

206
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,198
Du Tongjun

207
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:07,833
If there is a dispute

208
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,335
The consequences are unimaginable

209
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,305
I'm waiting for training

210
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:17,476
Where did the dispute come from?

211
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,012
If the Qing Emperor ordered

212
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,347
Let the cavalry return to Youzhou

213
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:22,514
Then go back.

214
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,952
Youzhou Military Supervision Department

215
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:28,821
Always loyal to Qingtianzi

216
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:31,223
Then let's train here

217
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,491
What's the point?

218
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,830
Youzhou Army rectified military discipline before

219
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,898
But we caught a lot of traitors

220
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:41,633
I remember

221
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,103
They are all the confidants of Brother Ningling

222
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,105
Brother Ning Ling is hateful

223
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:48,474
But now I heard

224
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,875
People have been imprisoned

225
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:52,878
Those traitors

226
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,414
Still saved a few lives

227
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:01,153
yes

228
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,955
Du Tongjun is kind

229
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:04,823
Let them go

230
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,561
Release

231
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:11,997
Brother Ning Ling is in our Youzhou Army

232
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:12,998
Have a confidant

233
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,034
But what about the other military supervisory departments?

234
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,469
Do you think he will let it go?

235
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,704
How much is that

236
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,106
They all were bribed, right?

237
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,416
Give these letters to those traitors

238
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,151
Then let him go

239
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,987
Youzhou pigeon

240
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,757
Mountains and water

241
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:13,358
two inseparable

242
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:16,995
I don't want them to separate either

243
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:18,530
If there is news

244
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,599
You can leave it to it to bring the letter back

245
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,704
Remember with your companions

246
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:27,106
In Daxia

247
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,575
You will never be at the end of your rope

248
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,477
Because of the Youzhou Army

249
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,613
It will always be your retreat

250
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:50,963
I can help you

251
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:52,798
There's only so much left

252
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:01,640
Qing Tianzi

253
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:03,175
The military situation is urgent

254
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,910
In addition to the Yuzhou Military Supervision Department

255
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,512
Other military supervision departments

256
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,480
All soldiers and horses left the headquarters

257
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:12,618
The scene is so big

258
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:14,419
nominally

259
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,255
It’s the same as the Yuzhou Military Supervisory Department

260
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:17,556
It's said to be a training exercise for soldiers and horses

261
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,191
But actually I heard

262
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,226
I heard that I received everything

263
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:22,594
The Prince's Clothes Order

264
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:24,363
Said to be

265
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,031
Prince and Qingtianzi

266
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:27,266
Confrontation in the Imperial Palace

267
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,268
It's about to be replaced.

268
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,970
Let his subordinates raise troops to serve the king

269
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:38,877
these individuals

270
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,013
It should be Brother Ning Ling

271
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,614
Last resort

272
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:43,582
Qing Tianzi

273
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:44,383
or

274
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,418
Let’s go back to Xingqing Mansion first.

275
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:47,920
No need

276
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,856
Once they all jump out, it will be easy to clean up.

277
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,659
I'm just afraid things will change.

278
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,993
What are you afraid of?

279
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:57,930
you and

280
00:19:58,263 --> 00:19:59,598
The garrison who left the palace said

281
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,266
Camp at the foot of the mountain and wait for our military orders

282
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:02,701
Qing Tianzi

283
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:03,635
still

284
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,537
Let’s mobilize the garrison of Xingqing Mansion first.

285
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,506
If the palace guards are moved,

286
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:08,440
Afraid it will affect

287
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:09,775
Palace guard

288
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,745
The defenders of Xingqing Mansion must not be moved lightly

289
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,414
Just do it

290
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,549
The garrison of the palace is enough

291
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:19,251
this is a good thing

292
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:21,186
take this opportunity

293
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:23,021
The military power of these supervisors and military commanders

294
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:24,189
Take it all back

295
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,891
Raise for a year and a half

296
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,492
Then we can send troops to Song Dynasty

297
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,494
Less worries

298
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,431
But the people's livelihood in Daxia was in decline

299
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:33,832
Not one for a year and a half

300
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:35,400
I'm afraid I won't be able to recover.

301
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,537
I protect the people of Daxia

302
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:39,638
so many years

303
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,641
It's not an exaggeration to feel wronged to them, right?

304
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,109
That's natural

305
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,514
A man’s meritorious deeds should come from troubled times

306
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,216
If the world is peaceful

307
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:53,185
Then kill him and bring chaos out of the world

308
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:56,355
one day

309
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,657
Our Great Xia flag shakes the mountains and rivers

310
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,225
When I leave my name in the history books

311
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:01,159
These dead people

312
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:02,494
It's nothing

313
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,229
Qingtianzi Shengming

314
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,636
What did you just say the prince used?

315
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:11,903
Clothes edict

316
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:14,239
The edict hidden in the belt

317
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,741
There is also some literary talent

318
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,811
It's just too much of a belt.

319
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,347
Where did I get so many belts?

320
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,550
I'm not a clothing store owner.

321
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,052
I am the prince

322
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,556
This is all from my time in the military

323
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:32,791
last resort

324
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:37,029
How could they be so impulsive?

325
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:38,730
I heard about one

326
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:39,998
There are clothes and belt edicts

327
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:41,400
one more

328
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,701
See the Youzhou Military Supervision Department

329
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:43,802
So loyal

330
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:44,970
Someone takes the lead

331
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,672
Naturally, some people are unwilling to be second to others.

332
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:51,543
Where did the Youzhou Army get its loyalty and bravery?

333
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,480
All my people were plucked clean

334
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:57,349
Do not worry

335
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:58,583
Queen Mother

336
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,652
head-to-head confrontation

337
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,021
How can they be the rivals of their father?

338
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,824
I've been hiding it for so many years

339
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,593
Now it is destroyed in one day, the Queen Mother

340
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,496
At least it's a variable

341
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,332
The queen is right

342
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,512
You actually have the nerve to come see me

343
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,252
The garrison at the Imperial Palace has gone down the mountain to set up camp.

344
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:35,721
Currently in the Imperial Palace

345
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,222
Only ordinary guards remain

346
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:42,160
so what

347
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:44,363
Guard dispatch

348
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:46,498
The Prime Minister personally controls

349
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,266
So tomorrow afternoon

350
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:50,068
There are very few guards around Yuan Hao

351
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,105
Go there again

352
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,874
Join forces to assassinate

353
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,275
We agreed

354
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,077
Assassination on wedding day

355
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:00,879
Isn’t that what we agreed to do?

356
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:02,514
Now is a better time

357
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,616
My father’s military power is superb

358
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,918
Even if we join forces to attack

359
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:08,620
Can't kill him either

360
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,390
In fact, the layout of the wedding

361
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,424
no waste

362
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:14,559
We actually met the new princess

363
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:16,194
What

364
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,294
There's something wrong with the wine

365
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:50,595
Drugged

366
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:51,630
What medicine

367
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:00,338
This medicine can save Wang Kuan's life

368
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,674
Just drugged

369
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:04,709
Drugged

370
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:08,980
Can't we just poison it directly?

371
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:10,682
Yuan Hao takes the guard to test the poison

372
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,018
The amount of drugs in alcohol is very small

373
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,020
It's not a big deal if you drink one or two pots

374
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:16,822
But if you drink it for a long time

375
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:17,923
Unavoidable confusion

376
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:19,024
Weak hands and feet

377
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:20,792
Yuan Hao takes the guard to test the poison

378
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,427
Won't cause any trouble

379
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,700
this arrangement

380
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:31,636
why didn't you tell me in advance

381
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:35,740
Don’t you understand this yet?

382
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:39,311
People can't trust you at all

383
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:45,183
Then we don't have to

384
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:46,384
Collaborate again

385
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,256
If you don’t assassinate Yuan Hao

386
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,458
Is there any way to survive?

387
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:58,797
Battle tomorrow

388
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:00,298
It's the end

389
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,268
It’s also your last way to survive.

390
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:15,881
There's poison in the wine

391
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:18,049
Not highly toxic

392
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,518
Drink for a long time

393
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:20,519
Only effective

394
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,294
This wine

395
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:31,830
Still haven’t moved the gift from the imperial concubine’s house?

396
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:32,931
But drugged

397
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:34,299
It's Qizhai

398
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:39,037
Invisible

399
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:40,438
Now Ning Lingge

400
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:41,373
Supervising military departments in various places

401
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,307
mobilize means

402
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:43,842
They did it too

403
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:45,777
they just want you

404
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:46,678
Lead troops to fight

405
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:47,546
this medicine

406
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:49,915
It makes me exhausted

407
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,182
maybe

408
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:53,151
Died in front of the two armies

409
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:54,519
Since we want to cooperate

410
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:55,954
You can't die

411
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:04,496
what is this

412
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:05,997
Don't believe me

413
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:07,499
I often drink

414
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,635
I drank a lot these days

415
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:11,503
so what

416
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:12,571
so

417
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,273
If your body feels wrong

418
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:17,576
I can detect it

419
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,114
stop looking

420
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:24,516
All changed

421
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:26,952
You are alert

422
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,522
You really want to cooperate with me

423
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:33,091
After the wedding

424
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:35,026
I'm afraid I won't have the chance to kill you again

425
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:37,062
I want to go back to Song Dynasty with them

426
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:40,599
Danyuan Tianguan

427
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,000
Not dead yet

428
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:45,070
I'll always find him

429
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:48,506
After returning to the Song Dynasty

430
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,908
I also want to lend you this place

431
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:50,842
Climbing up

432
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:52,344
So you

433
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:53,511
The identity of the ruler of Western Xia

434
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:54,913
Better hold still

435
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:57,983
what do you want to say

436
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:59,517
I heard that on the wedding day

437
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:00,919
you despise gods

438
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:04,756
divine punishment

439
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:06,091
Not you yet

440
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:07,559
What a good thing

441
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:09,027
have you ever thought about

442
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:11,229
What if the gods surrendered to you?

443
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:16,001
Shibuyuan has been suppressed by you

444
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,370
And those costumes of the Sheep God

445
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:19,904
It should be in your hands too

446
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:21,906
In the past, divine messengers had their own lineage

447
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,108
Unrestricted

448
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:24,576
but you can let

449
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:25,777
A new angel appears

450
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,512
Even the gods are shocked by you

451
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:28,780
Willing to surrender

452
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:30,782
If the gods are also at your disposal

453
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,384
Who else can threaten

454
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:33,585
Your throne of the blue emperor

455
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:42,560
Within the palace

456
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:43,895
reset altar

457
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,397
Fake Messenger of God

458
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,067
God this thing

459
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:50,702
Who can use it?

460
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,506
Since people's hearts are now in turmoil

461
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,341
Then let the gods speak

462
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,142
Admit this to me

463
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:58,610
The Power of the Blue Emperor

464
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:01,112
enemy means

465
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,347
for my use

466
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:03,581
Wonderful

467
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:05,350
When to arrange

468
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,852
It’s urgent to win people’s hearts

469
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:08,753
Tomorrow

470
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:10,622
Yes, sir.

471
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:02,574
Poisoning in wine

472
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:04,843
You told Yuan Hao

473
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:10,815
He noticed it himself

474
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,818
Sister Zhao said it a long time ago

475
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:16,254
This long-term method of drugging

476
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,355
Actually it’s not easy to use

477
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:19,357
Especially those who lead troops all year round

478
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,192
Something strange about the body

479
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:22,427
There will always be something noticed

480
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,195
There is no medicine in this world

481
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:24,662
It really can

482
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:26,064
No early symptoms

483
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:26,831
Then one day

484
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:27,999
It broke out suddenly

485
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,334
If you really want to be useful

486
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:30,835
Still have to take some strong medicine temporarily

487
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,337
Yuan Hao has already decided

488
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:33,671
Fake Messenger

489
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:34,672
hold a ceremony

490
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,375
Wonho Present

491
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:39,210
I should already trust you

492
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:42,380
Revenge for killing father

493
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:44,315
How could you not believe it?

494
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:50,922
If it weren't for Wang Kuan that day,

495
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,191
I can't get through it either

496
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:54,459
this life

497
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:56,060
I owe you

498
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,030
If you want to take

499
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:02,233
You can take it anytime

500
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:03,301
I don't want your life

501
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:07,739
I want to kill

502
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:09,974
It's Yuantianguan

503
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:11,075
Yanei

504
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,111
I have a question

505
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:15,680
Yuantianguan kills uncle

506
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,715
Is it really for Yuan Zhongxin?

507
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:23,354
sudden change

508
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:24,756
emotionally charged

509
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:26,191
Actually calm down

510
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:28,259
Of course you can think of it

511
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,194
what comes to mind

512
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:34,532
You also heard what Yuan Zhongxin said

513
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:36,501
Those explanations of Yuantianguan

514
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,139
Actually I'm fine

515
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:42,640
Taking care of your feelings

516
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:44,175
Logically speaking

517
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:45,376
I will kill directly

518
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:46,878
Just your friends

519
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,881
it's good now

520
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,616
I kill Wei Zhuoran

521
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:53,852
There is a gap between you and Qizhai.

522
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,854
If it is really to make Yuan Zhongxin

523
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:57,555
Cut off contact with Qizhai

524
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,224
He admitted directly at that time

525
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:00,225
Killed Prince Zhao himself

526
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:00,959
It's over.

527
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,094
Now kill my uncle again

528
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:04,662
unnecessary

529
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,332
If not for Yuan Zhongxin

530
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:08,867
Then why did he start?

531
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,201
What we want is

532
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:12,170
Yuan Tianguan and his uncle

533
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:13,938
What kind of relationship is it?

534
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:15,273
What does this have to do with

535
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,374
Yanei

536
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:17,775
Let me explain first

537
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,612
The relationship between Yuan Tianguan and his uncle

538
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,180
This is just my guess

539
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:23,214
no evidence

540
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:24,616
You speak first

541
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:25,850
you should remember

542
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,352
Yuantian Pass was once

543
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:28,786
Lu Zhangyuan’s Demon Star

544
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,756
The spy back then

545
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:33,892
In addition to the twenty-eight constellations

546
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,794
There are also some named after demon stars

547
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:40,598
Yuan Zhongxin

548
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:41,900
Your father was

549
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:43,701
It is known as

550
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:45,470
Chiyou Flag

551
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:48,339
I know this

552
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,241
But what does this have to do with my dad?

553
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:51,709
Si Weixing also said

554
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:53,611
Where did the spies come from back then?

555
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,282
Long before the Secret Pavilion

556
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,449
Lu Guannian

557
00:31:58,449 --> 00:31:59,951
Create your own spy

558
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:01,452
Select people at that time

559
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:03,154
Or choose among the military

560
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,356
Or choose a strange person among the people

561
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,225
Or

562
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:09,761
Prisoner

563
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,696
With training, you can meet the enemy

564
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:13,665
Remember

565
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,199
when saying this

566
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,067
I am here

567
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:17,468
What is the first rule of selection?

568
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:19,437
Military selection

569
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:20,972
If there is no military order from the Privy Council

570
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,273
How can you select people from the army?

571
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,841
That's the case

572
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:24,876
There should be people in the army

573
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,144
Familiar with Lu Zhangyuan

574
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,278
Exchange what is needed

575
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:28,513
you mean

576
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:29,747
My dad

577
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:31,215
Yanei

578
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,051
do you remember

579
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:34,319
Why did you enter the Secret Pavilion?

580
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:37,322
Because I met you and Yuan Zhongxin

581
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:38,823
Why did Master Lu choose you?

582
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:39,991
because

583
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,627
My father is the palace commander

584
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,028
If so

585
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,296
The head of the hospital should be the general

586
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,531
Children of important civil and military officials in the court

587
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:47,832
Just search them all and bring them in.

588
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:48,733
Aren't you the same?

589
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,268
I got him involved.

590
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:52,136
I stay in the Secret Pavilion

591
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,438
It's my own free will

592
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,273
what about you

593
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:56,774
The dean summons you

594
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:58,242
Is it just a coincidence?

595
00:32:58,876 --> 00:32:59,510
That

596
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:01,512
Why did the Chancellor choose me?

597
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,014
Now it seems

598
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:04,615
Uncle's cruel plan

599
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:05,984
There was a plan at that time

600
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,386
Now that I'm ready to lose my reputation

601
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,521
The only thing I can't let go

602
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:12,557
It's just you

603
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:15,893
entrust

604
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,997
It was he who handed me over to the governor

605
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,331
Act in this way

606
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:22,066
Not a close friend

607
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:24,802
My father and the dean are old friends.

608
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:29,474
At that time, the commander-in-chief organized secret agents

609
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,709
Military selection

610
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:34,779
My father is also helping him.

611
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:36,080
cause and effect

612
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:37,715
Is it appropriate?

613
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:39,550
Makes sense

614
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:42,387
What about Yuantian Pass?

615
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,188
Lu Zhangyuan established a secret agent that year

616
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:46,024
With the full support of the Privy Council

617
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:47,091
What do you think of the Privy Council?

618
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:48,292
To the person chosen by the Chancellor

619
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:49,694
Can you really ignore it and not ask?

620
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,397
My father and Yuan Tianguan have known each other for a long time

621
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,431
Yanei

622
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:55,466
Your father was kidnapped

623
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,701
Do you think he was

624
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,835
What are you most afraid of?

625
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:00,271
What is my dad most afraid of?

626
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:01,506
Uncle pretends to surrender

627
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,574
Nature has long put life and death at risk

628
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:05,076
He is not afraid of death

629
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,711
My father is not afraid of death

630
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,212
But Yuanhao wants to force you to show up

631
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:11,182
My dad is afraid

632
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:14,519
It's me showing up

633
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:15,787
If it were you

634
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:18,556
What should you ask for then?

635
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:24,429
Wish to die

636
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:28,533
So he killed my father

637
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:30,668
It's to save me

638
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:31,702
Yuantianguan if

639
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:33,104
I have known your father for a long time

640
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:36,107
They want to kill Yuan Hao

641
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,142
Not necessarily impossible to cooperate

642
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:49,754
Say it again

643
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:51,522
Just a guess

644
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:52,657
no evidence

645
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:55,693
Nayuan Tianguan

646
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:56,894
why not tell the truth

647
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:01,232
wrong

648
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,336
He wanted Yuan Zhongxin to leave Xixia

649
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:07,839
This is also true

650
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:12,677
Connect it like this

651
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:15,680
And it does make sense

652
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:19,183
let me see

653
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:22,220
let me think again

654
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:25,823
let me think again

655
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,934
What is the truth?

656
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:38,769
You still have to ask Yuan Tianguan

657
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:41,272
This is Jean Yuanhao

658
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:42,507
Opportunity to relax your guard

659
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:43,641
I avenge my father

660
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:44,909
Reasonable

661
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:47,378
First round of wedding

662
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:48,813
Exposing Brother Ning Ling

663
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:50,748
This round of mutiny

664
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:52,583
Another reminder of drunkenness and drug addiction

665
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,018
After all, who would have thought

666
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:56,654
You will do it with your own hands

667
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,222
Burned Webster's body

668
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:00,892
besides

669
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:07,899
a broken arm

670
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:09,400
Make the best use of everything

671
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:11,502
Better than decaying into dust

672
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:14,305
who would have thought

673
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:15,840
We are so hard on ourselves

674
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,508
Especially in Yanei

675
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:19,377
Go and see Yuan Hao in person

676
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,479
It's very likely that he'll come back alive.

677
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:22,947
So he won't doubt it

678
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:24,815
Who would take their own life?

679
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:25,650
Come for adventure

680
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,417
yes

681
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:29,253
how could they know

682
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:31,155
Now that we are here

683
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:35,226
I never thought about going back alive again

684
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:02,620
look

685
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:04,822
no difference

686
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,259
Everyone

687
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:13,197
Tomorrow's Road

688
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:14,799
Maybe it's the end

689
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,271
I'm very happy

690
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:21,505
can meet you

691
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,616
Seven fasts in one

692
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,584
life and death together

693
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,592
Why didn't the other two follow?

694
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:15,860
Broken arm

695
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:16,994
How else to fight?

696
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,796
My arm is broken and I'm alone

697
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:19,530
Where is the other one?

698
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:20,998
You have to stay and take care of me

699
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,601
Not bad for them

700
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:26,937
Now in this palace

701
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:28,706
There are not many guards left.

702
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:29,940
Most of them were transferred by me

703
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,641
If it is a guard

704
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:31,976
What should I do if I hear the noise and come back?

705
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:34,512
The passage in front of the palace gate is narrow

706
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:35,880
If there are reinforcements

707
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,148
I'll stop

708
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:41,619
good

709
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,455
Loyalty of the Yeli Clan

710
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:46,557
never let me down

711
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:49,560
my family

712
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:50,661
friend

713
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:51,796
partner

714
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:53,831
All died on this land

715
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:55,733
their will

716
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:57,601
I'll inherit

717
00:38:58,102 --> 00:38:58,969
yes

718
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:02,306
How many heroes are there in the Yeli clan?

719
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:03,674
Died at the hands of Yuan Hao

720
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:06,711
I understand you

721
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:10,081
I'll go check it out again

722
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:11,515
Can you protect these people?

723
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,550
Move further

724
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:13,784
Wish you all

725
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:15,219
Immediate success

726
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,577
There is no hiding the insidiousness and cunning of Pang

727
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:40,711
Immortal

728
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,981
I will never let you go

729
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:46,350
On insidiousness

730
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:48,452
You won’t lose to Mu Zang either

731
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:53,691
I only have this one subordinate now

732
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:57,261
No threat

733
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,532
Kill or hide Pang?

734
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,835
The way to coexist

735
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:05,936
rest assured

736
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,840
If you don’t hide it, you won’t die.

737
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,475
He will definitely not let us go

738
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:13,677
So we will definitely kill him

739
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:15,479
After all, we ourselves

740
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:18,015
I still want to find a way out.

741
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,184
talk to smart people

742
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:22,420
It's just peace of mind.

743
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:41,539
What's this

744
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,240
help you wake up

745
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,582
Isn't the drug in the wine?

746
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,028
Let's go

747
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:06,497
Go see Yuan Hao for the last time

748
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,441
Wait and push them out first

749
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:19,210
It’s better to lose both sides

750
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:24,114
They all say he is Qing Tianzi

751
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:27,551
It’s not appropriate to never return to heaven.
