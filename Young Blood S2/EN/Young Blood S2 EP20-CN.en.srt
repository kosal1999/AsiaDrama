1
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,440
Tomorrow's camp

2
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,641
You mother and son

3
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:50,376
Come with me to the Rikyu Palace.

4
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,612
Stay for two days to enjoy the mountain view

5
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:53,947
That's great

6
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,548
this child

7
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:56,850
Always hope

8
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,418
I am being filial under your knees

9
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,620
This time I got my wish

10
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:02,422
It's good to be filial

11
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:03,990
Just don't try your best

12
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,158
Become a send-off

13
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:06,459
Father

14
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,895
You can't say such things

15
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,964
My son's heart will hurt when he hears this

16
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,222
You didn't make a move on the wooden platform

17
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:38,458
done right

18
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:42,262
I think he is basically

19
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:44,030
Playing cat and mouse game

20
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,198
enjoying the moment

21
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,134
He is indeed strong

22
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:49,903
but it doesn't matter

23
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,371
as long as you live

24
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,040
There will definitely be a chance

25
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:55,608
I see

26
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,978
Mi Qinmubei's corpse

27
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,014
Just hang it outside

28
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:03,850
Warn me?

29
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,886
He can be considered loyal

30
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:10,089
How about I find a reason?

31
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,691
Buried him too

32
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,425
No

33
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:16,963
Mi Qinmu Bei is indeed loyal

34
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,266
But it’s meaningless when people die

35
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,803
Who would risk a dead man?

36
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:51,624
what you up to

37
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,960
Set fire to the wooden platform

38
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,029
Let Chu Niao return to heaven and earth

39
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,263
What are the consequences?

40
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:58,531
I'll be more careful

41
00:04:58,731 --> 00:04:59,999
Just don't let anyone see it

42
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,403
Why did Yuan Hao put the corpse

43
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,237
On wooden table

44
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:10,777
Destroy the morale of the troops

45
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:12,578
anything else

46
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,149
Say I know you can guess

47
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,251
Miqinmu has been a leader in the North for many years

48
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,019
There will always be people loyal to him

49
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,622
Yuan Hao hopes to use rice bird's body

50
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,257
Fish these people out

51
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,659
I know I'm going to die even though I know it

52
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,728
You can't hang around like this

53
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,296
Your identity as a Yeli clan member

54
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,597
Will be of great use in the future

55
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,132
So you can't die

56
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,135
Even if you can't bear it anymore, you have to endure it

57
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,137
More than one Chu Niao died in Bazhai

58
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,641
Now there's only two of us left

59
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:43,710
for what

60
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,118
Kill Yuan Hao

61
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,025
So you are not qualified to take risks

62
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,028
If the mission fails, you have to live.

63
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,134
where did you go

64
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:10,002
You can't control me

65
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:10,970
Put down the torch

66
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,574
Please keep your voice down

67
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:17,210
Didn't you say the mission failed?

68
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:18,845
Do you have to live?

69
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,386
I've been showing up too much over the years

70
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,822
Since Yuan Hao wants to get rid of the divine envoy

71
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:31,090
I don't have a chance

72
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:31,958
Return to Xingqing Mansion

73
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:34,093
But it's okay

74
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:35,862
Become a god these years

75
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,897
In fact, it all relied on Qizhai's help.

76
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,600
It's perfect to leave it to them

77
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,102
The ones from Qizhai

78
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:44,737
Although not as smart as me

79
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:46,105
But it's okay

80
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,774
They have friendship with Brother Ning Ling

81
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,375
I also know Yuzhou Army

82
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:50,777
Things I haven't done yet

83
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,646
You can also rest assured

84
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:54,480
entrusted to them

85
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,483
So you're a loser now

86
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:58,851
No matter what, I'm better than you

87
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,119
Since there is nothing to do

88
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,288
Just leave Xixia honestly

89
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:03,856
Return to Song Dynasty

90
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,496
I brought Chu Niao to Xixia

91
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:12,765
I brought it

92
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,767
I have to send it away

93
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,284
You don’t have to look at me like this

94
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,286
I don't have to die.

95
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,520
No one noticed after lighting the fire

96
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,455
I turned around and ran away

97
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,459
But I warn you Hua Ci Shu

98
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:44,330
If things change

99
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:46,933
You must not take action

100
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,838
I know my identity is useful

101
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,440
Yuan Hao is not dead

102
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,443
i must live

103
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,821
Have you ever regretted it?

104
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:09,889
What do you regret?

105
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:12,325
Join Secret Court

106
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,060
Join Bashai

107
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,330
there has never been

108
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,130
That's not it

109
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,037
you

110
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:27,940
Have you ever regretted it?

111
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,308
Bring Chu Niao and the others to Xixia

112
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,184
If there is no war

113
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:40,386
they should be able to

114
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:41,320
Keep living

115
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:42,989
Become an old man and an old woman

116
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:46,959
The way those guys are getting older

117
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:49,662
I can't imagine it at all

118
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,700
quite funny

119
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,640
Chu Niao after today

120
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,408
You are no longer a member of Bazhai

121
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:10,743
What you call kindness

122
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:11,544
Already paid off

123
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:13,646
The overall situation has been determined

124
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:15,414
I don't need you here anymore

125
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:17,683
then where should i go

126
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:20,886
Go the way you like

127
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:19,945
Didn't expect that

128
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,814
There really is a pair of rice birds in the north

129
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:22,948
So loyal

130
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,887
This person is dead

131
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,090
hung there and burned

132
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,658
What's the difference

133
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,927
Just for this fire

134
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,662
Put yourself in it too

135
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,131
Opponent

136
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,600
no the same

137
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,903
You will be dead soon

138
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,905
Are you stupid for doing this?

139
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,507
A bit silly indeed

140
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:49,942
But it does not matter

141
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:51,143
What's the meaning

142
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,678
I have been smart for so many years

143
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,346
Be silly once in a while

144
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:56,382
Understandable

145
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,285
This answer is interesting

146
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:31,050
Unexpectedly, Mi Qin Mu Bei

147
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,418
There are also subordinates like this

148
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:36,722
give you a chance

149
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,224
kneel down

150
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:39,492
I'm considering not killing you

151
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:42,862
Come

152
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,297
I won him over

153
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,457
This means you are ignorant

154
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,092
No matter what, I am too

155
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,360
The Lord of Daxia

156
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,929
Do everything yourself

157
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,830
what is your name

158
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:58,450
What are you looking at

159
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:00,986
fine

160
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:03,722
Let's continue

161
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:11,597
How about I give you another chance?

162
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,077
No

163
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,045
good

164
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,384
I just do not understand

165
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,652
What's the point of this?

166
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,963
because you are stupid

167
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:27,039
Know it earlier

168
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,309
No more cranes

169
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,571
In the end, I don’t even know what your name is.

170
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,263
Too busy too busy

171
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,298
That's just a little time

172
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:36,702
Sorry, sorry.

173
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:39,371
Are you hungry?

174
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:52,985
Eat freely

175
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:56,922
Where is this

176
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:59,458
You guys go down first

177
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,777
This is the palace

178
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:20,979
Qingtianzi's palace

179
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,048
Tired of staying in Xingqing Mansion

180
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:25,517
Just have fun here

181
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:26,618
Who are you

182
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,819
No hidden lies

183
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,821
Current Prime Minister of Daxia

184
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:30,889
correct

185
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:32,357
My sister

186
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:34,293
He is the owner of this palace

187
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,460
now

188
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:38,130
Qing Tianzi's favorite woman

189
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,065
The widow married by Yuanhao

190
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:40,799
That's her

191
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,135
Do you have anything else to ask?

192
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,305
why brought us here

193
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,373
Of course I will save your lives.

194
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,042
Yuan Hao deployed heavy troops

195
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,376
Guarding Helan Mountain

196
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,145
Direction to Xingqingfu

197
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:54,813
If I hadn't arrived early

198
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,281
at this moment

199
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:57,983
I'm afraid you're all dead

200
00:21:58,850 --> 00:21:59,584
rest assured

201
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,821
I put three corpses in the carriage

202
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,897
Qing Tianzi should also feel at ease.

203
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:13,332
why do you want to save us

204
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:15,901
you are dead

205
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,303
Who killed Yuan Hao?

206
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:20,238
I do not know what you're talking about

207
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,140
This is boring

208
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:23,508
you see me

209
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,377
Always so honest

210
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:27,079
Then you might as well be more honest

211
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:27,846
Can

212
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:34,286
I know you are from Song Dynasty

213
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:35,687
Also know

214
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,222
You cooperate with Brother Ning Ling

215
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:39,057
The purpose is to assassinate Yuan Hao

216
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:41,560
Eat quickly

217
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,527
Otherwise it will get cold

218
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:45,464
I'm saving you

219
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:49,501
Just want to help you

220
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:51,803
You help us kill Yuan Hao

221
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:53,138
That's what it means

222
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,740
You are the Prime Minister of Xixia

223
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:55,974
No hidden lies

224
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:57,042
Your sister is Yuan Hao

225
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:58,310
The most favored concubine

226
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,278
I just gave birth to a son for Qingtianzi

227
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:01,580
To tell you the truth

228
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,082
Now Qingtianzi spends most of his time

229
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,384
stay here

230
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,685
The Royal Palace of Xingqing Mansion

231
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:07,819
Almost deserted

232
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:10,055
then why do you

233
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,323
Help us kill Yuan Hao?

234
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:16,261
I am kind by nature

235
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:17,829
What

236
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:21,366
Brother Ning Ling is the prince

237
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,202
But Qingtianzi was on guard against him

238
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:25,303
Lift military power

239
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:26,538
He did nothing wrong

240
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:28,540
But was treated like this

241
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,542
I really can't stand it

242
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:34,045
People always have to be reasonable

243
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:35,580
Be humane

244
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,283
Otherwise, he would become a beast, right?

245
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:43,255
You want to kill Yuan Hao for Brother Ning Ling?

246
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,024
Do you think we will believe it?

247
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:47,859
Otherwise, what would I do to save you?

248
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,828
If I harm you

249
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:50,829
Take you directly

250
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,464
If you leave it to Qing Tianzi, it will be over.

251
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,499
Isn’t that true?

252
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:01,573
Not surprisingly

253
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:03,375
these two days

254
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,444
Qingtianzi will return to the palace

255
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,479
I'll make arrangements then

256
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,081
Let you assassinate Yuan Hao

257
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,750
Believe it or not

258
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,819
We won’t know until then

259
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:14,820
what chance

260
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:16,822
you

261
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,758
How do you plan to kill Yuan Hao?

262
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,326
A reminder

263
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,763
Qingtianzi's fighting power is unparalleled

264
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:26,331
It's not okay to use force

265
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:30,268
Use poison

266
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:34,806
good idea

267
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:36,374
I'll give you the chance to poison

268
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,743
Arrange for you to sneak into the apse

269
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,879
Wait for the poison to take its toll and kill it

270
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,283
Then we should thank you

271
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:47,285
Then don't bother me

272
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,820
To show sincerity

273
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,121
I have withdrawn all my guards.

274
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:53,024
If you don’t want to assassinate Qingtianzi

275
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:55,026
You can leave on your own

276
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,495
Candid enough?

277
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:58,930
farewell

278
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:37,569
The guards are gone

279
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:40,772
This should really be the palace

280
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,629
There seems to be no poison in the food

281
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,734
Prime Minister of Xixia

282
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,503
Fight the injustice for Ning Lingge

283
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:12,971
Do you believe it?

284
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:13,905
Do not believe

285
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,378
It must be fake to defend oneself

286
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,214
Maybe it was a borrowed knife to kill someone

287
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:24,783
power struggle

288
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:26,184
possible

289
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:27,485
Not quite right

290
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,487
If he is really the prime minister

291
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,222
Want to keep position and power

292
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:33,124
The prerequisite is that Yuan Hao is alive

293
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:34,559
No matter how hard we fight

294
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:36,227
Nor will you dig your own grave

295
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:38,129
That's right too

296
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:41,399
Then his identity is lying

297
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,737
Too little information to judge

298
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,506
What the Prime Minister just said

299
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,908
None of it is credible

300
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:52,210
Go or stay

301
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:53,945
Leave

302
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:54,846
That's right

303
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:56,982
This may be the one who killed Yuan Hao

304
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:58,016
great opportunity

305
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,818
But we can't completely

306
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:01,019
Follow his arrangements

307
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:14,799
Let’s eat first

308
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,134
Really hungry

309
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,045
Yanei

310
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,481
I've never heard of it in my life

311
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:06,117
Words that make people happier than before

312
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:15,927
another

313
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:45,824
woke up

314
00:28:58,169 --> 00:28:59,771
So anxious to die

315
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:02,607
You are still useful

316
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,397
Come and check

317
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,535
come over

318
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:54,125
You pushed this car

319
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:55,560
Scared my beast, you

320
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:21,319
Take care

321
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:24,455
Is this this?

322
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:25,423
Yes, this is it

323
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:26,257
okay

324
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,228
No money, no money, no money

325
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:33,965
I'll give you money

326
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:36,467
Let me ask you something

327
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:38,970
Officials of the Song Dynasty who served the Qing Emperor

328
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,138
Where do you usually live?

329
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:41,973
The west side of the city

330
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:43,141
All the people from Song Dynasty lived there

331
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:43,942
Go forward

332
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:44,976
Just turn around and you'll be there

333
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:57,288
Are you okay?

334
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:58,389
just in front

335
00:30:58,389 --> 00:30:59,157
You go ahead

336
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:21,946
Where is my wallet?

337
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:23,281
Is this yours

338
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:26,050
Picked up on the road

339
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:26,651
thank you

340
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:28,653
Please ask about that

341
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,622
Where did the officials of the Song Dynasty live?

342
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:32,090
In the west of the city

343
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:33,458
It's just past three alleys

344
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:34,325
Song people

345
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:35,493
Basically everyone lives there

346
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:37,088
Yuan Zhongxin

347
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:42,727
Save Yanei

348
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:44,629
what on earth are you going to say

349
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:47,265
Come

350
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:48,466
Come

351
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:33,678
Where are my things?

352
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:38,583
How long have I been unconscious?

353
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,284
Three days

354
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,220
Three days

355
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:47,091
what happened

356
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:49,494
There is news from Helan Mountain

357
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:52,330
Yuan Hao killed the Sheep Keeper

358
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:54,866
This news is like a bolt from the blue

359
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,335
Today's Xingqing Mansion

360
00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:59,137
It's an undercurrent

361
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:00,571
Everyone has their own agenda

362
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:02,940
Isn’t Yuan Hao very prestigious?

363
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:04,308
No higher than gods

364
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,177
three years

365
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:08,946
The Sheep God spreads throughout Daxia

366
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,149
Although Daxia mainly believes in Buddhism

367
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:12,617
But the sheep god

368
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:14,052
Some foundation

369
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:15,420
Moreover

370
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:16,788
White Crane Throws Fire

371
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,057
There are signs of divine punishment

372
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:20,925
Believers in God

373
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,293
Why not be afraid

374
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,295
White Crane Throws Fire

375
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:29,700
A divine envoy died in battle in Yuanhao camp

376
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:31,169
Died in fire

377
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:32,737
Immediately

378
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,339
A white crane cries sadly and descends from the sky

379
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:38,109
Throw yourself into the fire and die with it

380
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,344
Wen Shao

381
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:46,984
The white crane is a noble bird in Daxia

382
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:48,719
Died in fire

383
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,656
It became even more clear that the gods were in trouble

384
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:55,326
wrong

385
00:34:58,629 --> 00:34:59,464
Why did Yuan Hao want to

386
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:00,398
The crime of killing the angel

387
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:01,599
Take it to yourself

388
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:03,668
The news travels too fast

389
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:05,169
He couldn't stop him even if he wanted to

390
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:07,839
Things like white cranes throwing themselves into fire

391
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,440
Unless you see it with your own eyes

392
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:11,642
Otherwise it would be difficult to spread the word

393
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:13,978
There is someone around Yuan Hao

394
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,079
The news leaked

395
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:18,616
should be

396
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:19,851
Who is the one

397
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,653
There are so many people who believe in God

398
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:24,388
God knows

399
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:29,227
How should Yuan Hao cope?

400
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:32,230
Now it’s not just Xingqing Mansion

401
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,699
News that Qingtianzi killed the divine envoy

402
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:36,467
Has spread throughout Daxia

403
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:39,003
There are people everywhere whose hearts are floating

404
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,771
Passed pretty fast

405
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,707
But until now

406
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:44,041
Haven't found who it is

407
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,409
spread the word

408
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:46,978
What about the prince and queen?

409
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:49,947
Guarded by personal guards

410
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:53,417
The prince shouldn't have a chance

411
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,086
spread the word

412
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:58,256
This situation now

413
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,958
Should we still stand still?

414
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,126
Why move?

415
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,929
Is it possible that people who have heard of it

416
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:05,963
Kill them all

417
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:08,199
Wait a little longer

418
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,303
Are you saying that Yuan Hao went to the palace?

419
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:13,771
Never showed up

420
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:15,706
he did nothing

421
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:19,477
He is waiting

422
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:20,778
Yeah

423
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,046
What are you waiting for?

424
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:24,682
Someone around me leaked the news

425
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:26,417
Waiting to find out who it is

426
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:27,418
It’s easier to deal with it

427
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:29,520
Provoking the Gods

428
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:30,688
Panic

429
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:32,657
Be quiet and wait.

430
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:34,325
Let time eliminate fear

431
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:35,826
Right

432
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:37,929
Kill the Guardian Angel

433
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,497
It doesn’t necessarily mean disobeying the gods.

434
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,132
Wait for a while

435
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:43,868
Everyone looked at the gods and never got angry

436
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:45,403
Divine Punishment did not appear either

437
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:46,637
panic

438
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:48,172
It will slowly fade away

439
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:49,440
yes

440
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,842
Everyone will think that the gods are not angry

441
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:53,978
Maybe the messenger really made a mistake

442
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:55,413
And Yuan Hao killed him

443
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,215
It was really the order of the gods.

444
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,617
Will the gods be angry?

445
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:02,687
There is no god

446
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,790
That means there will be no response

447
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:08,693
Although there is no god

448
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:11,762
But someone

449
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,165
God is not angry

450
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:15,700
I'm angry for him

451
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:17,168
God does not punish

452
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:18,402
I'll punish

453
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:20,171
I have no control over whether you are punished or not.

454
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,138
Yuan Zhongxin

455
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:23,741
you asked me so many questions

456
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,576
I replied the same thing

457
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:27,411
Now it's my turn to ask you something

458
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,047
Where is my son?

459
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:59,210
I thought you were going on a hunger strike

460
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,478
I have to survive

461
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:03,147
want revenge

462
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:04,282
Good

463
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:07,785
Only when people have desire can life be lively

464
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:08,986
why don't you kill me

465
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:10,054
nonsense

466
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,489
You are still useful

467
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,458
You eat and drink well first

468
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,494
Let's wait for the news together slowly

469
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:17,662
What news are you waiting for?

470
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,065
Or put him in a dungeon

471
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:22,300
Need not

472
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,335
They are guests

473
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,103
Treat well

474
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,339
Don't worry, King

475
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:30,107
Good wine and good meat

476
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:32,743
Where's your sister?

477
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,647
Guarding the prince

478
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,749
After all, I'm still young

479
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:58,703
or

480
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,005
I asked her to come down and accompany the king

481
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:03,140
No need

482
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:05,976
It's fine for me to drink alone.

483
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,411
No need for anyone to accompany you

484
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,253
I didn't even panic

485
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:17,922
Why are you sighing?

486
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:19,290
I am guilty.

487
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:20,825
these three years

488
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:22,460
Chen also spread the news

489
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,128
The Grace of the Sheep Guardian

490
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:25,463
If not

491
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:27,798
There won’t be any disaster like today

492
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:31,502
This has nothing to do with you

493
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:32,770
these three years

494
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:34,638
I also use the Sheep Guardian

495
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:36,707
Only then did he establish the name of Qing Tianzi

496
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:38,776
spread the word for them

497
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:40,244
That's what I mean too.

498
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:41,979
Now it seems

499
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,082
It's drinking poison to quench thirst and bind oneself in a cocoon

500
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:50,054
The methods of these young men

501
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,455
It's really ok

502
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,559
It's a pity that it was too late to kill

503
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:58,462
It's already like this

504
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,565
I happened to take a look too

505
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:03,267
Under this disaster

506
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:05,069
Who is hiding evil intentions

507
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:07,171
The king is wise and far-sighted

508
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:09,039
Must be fine

509
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,641
Okay, get up quickly

510
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:11,242
Add wine

511
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,212
As merciful as the king

512
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:16,647
I don't believe it.

513
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:18,749
Someone really has a bad conscience

514
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,452
Conspiracy to rebel

515
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:23,921
My brother brought you here to watch

516
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:26,190
Just to make you believe

517
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:28,259
His identity

518
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:30,127
It's not a lie

519
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,010
Yuan Hao's son

520
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:52,683
Look at his eyes

521
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,118
Looks so much like him

522
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:55,252
Yes or no

523
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,858
That's your child's father down there

524
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:02,460
your husband

525
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:04,328
He is also the king of Daxia.

526
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:06,397
All your futures, brothers and sisters

527
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:07,698
All bets on him

528
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:10,134
I do not understand

529
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,669
Why do you want to help us kill him?

530
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:14,505
What did my brother say?

531
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:16,507
He said he was kind-hearted

532
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:18,042
Is this a bad reason?

533
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,416
You are brave enough

534
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:26,851
let us in

535
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:28,619
Not a single guard was left around.

536
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:29,820
kind person

537
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:32,723
You will feel that others are also kind

538
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:38,963
When to take action

539
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:40,130
Wait a little longer

540
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,267
Don't you want to poison me?

541
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:45,669
Yuan Hao is a very careful person

542
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:47,972
If you want to poison

543
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:50,407
You have to wait for the big banquet

544
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,743
There is opportunity for chaos

545
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:54,578
He is in the palace every day

546
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:56,213
No one is seen

547
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:57,448
How to throw a big banquet

548
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:59,049
He won't stay like this forever

549
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,284
When do you think he

550
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:01,118
There will be movement

551
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:03,921
Then we have to see

552
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,857
What is he waiting for now?

553
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,743
what am i waiting for

554
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,782
I'm just asking casually

555
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:33,784
Your Majesty, don’t take it seriously

556
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,222
I'm waiting for something to happen

557
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:40,858
Waiting for transfer

558
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:42,726
Waiting for mountain flood discharge

559
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,562
Waiting for someone to kill

560
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,965
There must be a follow-up to this divine disaster

561
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:51,335
This is the follow-up I'm waiting for

562
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:52,336
or

563
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:55,105
Arrange some cronies to join the army

564
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:56,440
after all

565
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,709
Stabilizing the morale of the military is the top priority

566
00:42:58,709 --> 00:42:59,577
No need

567
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:01,845
What news is there from the Yuzhou Army?

568
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:03,247
these days

569
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,149
But I didn’t see the Youzhou Army.

570
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:06,050
What happened?

571
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,020
The death of Liang Gewei

572
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,455
It's just so silent

573
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:14,458
The Yuzhou Army is now stabilized

574
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:18,162
This is quite rare

575
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:21,732
The Liang family has no male offspring

576
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:26,270
He had already thought about it

577
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:28,172
Let me take over the Yuzhou Army

578
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:31,442
You have to think about the consequences
