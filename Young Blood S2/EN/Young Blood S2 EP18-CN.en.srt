1
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:47,207
Long time no see Hua Cishu

2
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:50,343
haven't seen you for a long time

3
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:52,145
As the chief of Hachisai, I

4
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:53,313
Representing Bazhai

5
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,148
Welcome to Helan Mountain

6
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:56,549
You can't represent

7
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:57,817
I am the chief

8
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:58,785
The surname is Wen

9
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,053
You are just the deputy chief

10
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:01,855
okay

11
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:03,790
You two deputy chiefs of Bazhai

12
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,458
It's like no one knows

13
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:06,626
Funny

14
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,594
It's my turn to say this

15
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:08,661
Talk about something serious

16
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:09,462
ok

17
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,899
Our Bazhai is in the hands of Lu Zhangyuan

18
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:14,067
Picked up and sneaked into Xixia

19
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,468
The mission to kill Yuan Hao

20
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:16,803
we know this

21
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:17,570
Then wenwuqi

22
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,838
Come up with the plan to become a god

23
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,140
Want to borrow the will of God

24
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,841
The foundation of the bad Yuan Hao, the Lord of Xixia

25
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,076
We also know this

26
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:24,277
Then what else are you asking?

27
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:25,411
you

28
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:27,580
what's wrong with you

29
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:29,215
I ask you

30
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:30,416
Wenwuqi's plan

31
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:31,251
Do you think it's okay?

32
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,754
Not bad

33
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,856
Xixia people are quite superstitious.

34
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,192
No wonder you can't be the chief of the meal

35
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,161
What does this have to do with anything?

36
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:43,363
Zhao Zhaichang

37
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:44,831
What do you think

38
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,434
Do you think this plan won't work?

39
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:50,703
have a look

40
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,739
This is the vision of our chief priest

41
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:53,873
exactly the same

42
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,112
Yanei

43
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,315
Do you want to come to Bazhai and be the deputy chief?

44
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:06,653
Can I do that too?

45
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,188
This guy can do it

46
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,255
why can't you

47
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:10,323
The surname is Wen

48
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,691
Can you speak well?

49
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:13,092
It's not meant to be insulting.

50
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:14,260
etc.

51
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,862
Why is it insulting?

52
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,963
Wait a moment

53
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,464
Don't be impatient, everyone.

54
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:19,632
Let’s talk about business first

55
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:27,040
I don’t think it’s possible to become a god

56
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,841
Just take the people with lofty ideals in Bazhai

57
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,543
Made a new plan

58
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,180
Isn't this just a quarrel and separation?

59
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,415
Then six people are divided into two teams?

60
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,217
Go on

61
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:38,585
What's your plan?

62
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:39,452
Joining the WTO

63
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:41,754
Yuan Hao's power is overwhelming

64
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,190
If you want to kill him, you have to get close to him

65
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,259
How can I get close to him?

66
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,094
Of course they are from Xixia

67
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,298
To be fair to you all

68
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:53,666
Now I am

69
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,101
Queen Yeli's bodyguards

70
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:56,102
That's okay too

71
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:58,504
I took on the identity of the Yeli clan

72
00:03:58,638 --> 00:03:59,572
People of the same race are easy to talk to

73
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,441
If i remember correctly

74
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,077
Xiaoluo and Jinnian from Bazhai

75
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,678
I should be following you

76
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,280
They both also have new identities

77
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:11,784
People are gone

78
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,160
Bazhai

79
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:22,895
There are only three of you left.

80
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:26,633
That's about it.

81
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:27,734
What's almost the same

82
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,302
he means

83
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:30,837
sad regret

84
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,071
That's about it.

85
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,673
We don't have that much time to be depressed

86
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,907
Yuan Hao is still there

87
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:35,975
The task is not completed

88
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,343
Before coming to Xixia

89
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:38,211
we all know

90
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,178
what will be the result

91
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:42,081
How could it be possible to escape intact after killing Yuan Hao?

92
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,616
It’s just who comes first and who comes last

93
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:44,717
At that time we

94
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:45,652
Just tell ourselves

95
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,253
There is no need for tears in Yashi

96
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:48,721
Just keep moving forward

97
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:53,593
you two together

98
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,628
Must be the best chief

99
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,299
impossible

100
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:00,500
With him and without me

101
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:04,137
honestly

102
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,471
Listen to their names

103
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,674
One becomes a god and the other joins the world

104
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:08,908
Put these two together

105
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,276
A match made in heaven

106
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:11,678
Not a vegetarian

107
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:12,912
It's better not to talk nonsense

108
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,515
After all, my eyesight and ability are still lacking.

109
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,817
Can I hit someone?

110
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,451
Separate Separate

111
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:19,986
They are all classmates and old classmates

112
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:20,720
When I was in the Secret Pavilion

113
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,654
The two of them are the ones I want to fight the most.

114
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,222
I know I know

115
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:24,590
Who comes first and who comes last?

116
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:25,391
What

117
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,626
Do you want to hit me or him more?

118
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,828
I want to fight you both

119
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,029
tied for first

120
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,332
After all, he's not the chief

121
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,333
Limited vision

122
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,435
Not as good as Yanei

123
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,203
What does it have to do with me?

124
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:37,870
Separate Separate

125
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,504
Separate Separate

126
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,572
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

127
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,175
Still need to cooperate?

128
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,653
You've always been by Queen Yeli's side

129
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,188
There is a chance to assassinate Yuan Hao

130
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:56,222
never seen

131
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:58,257
Why

132
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:00,793
Queen Yeli has two brothers

133
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,695
Wild profit is prosperous, wild profit meets beggar

134
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:04,731
Yeli meets beggar

135
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,134
Yuan Hao killed Yeli Yuqi brothers

136
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:10,002
From then on, the twelve captains led the army

137
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,571
Only these ten are left

138
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:13,773
The left wing army and the right wing army

139
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,675
Now he has become Yuan Hao's personal guard

140
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:17,677
Yuan Hao killed

141
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,145
The Queen's Brother

142
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,781
Queen Yeli has since lost power

143
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,383
Yuan Hao rarely sees her either

144
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,851
Only her position as queen remained

145
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:26,753
No wonder you want

146
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:27,787
Persuade Queen Yeli

147
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:28,988
Assassination of Yuan Hao?

148
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:29,856
not only that

149
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,657
The concubine that Yuan Hao loves now

150
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:32,892
Born into the Wuzang clan

151
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,594
Just gave birth to a son for Yuan Hao

152
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,195
The position of Prince Ning Lingge

153
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,397
Precarious

154
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,433
Brother Ning Ling's life isn't that good either.

155
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:41,701
That one has no Zang family

156
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:42,502
It was still before

157
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:43,836
Yeli Yuqi's Wife

158
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:44,637
What

159
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,507
Wait a minute, let me sort it out.

160
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:48,775
It's a bit messy

161
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:50,777
Yeli Yuqishi

162
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:51,944
Queen Yeli's brother

163
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:54,147
Yuan Hao killed

164
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,214
Queen Yeli's brother

165
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:56,783
And then married this widow

166
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,217
That is to say

167
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:59,752
This Muzo clan and Queen Nori

168
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,187
Since we are sisters-in-law,

169
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,457
And they both married Yuan Hao at the same time

170
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,359
That's it

171
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:09,862
This is too messy

172
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,280
Have everyone been killed?

173
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,281
Brought back to camp

174
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:29,782
brought back to camp

175
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:31,651
I didn't tell you everything.

176
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:33,619
Do all people have to be eliminated?

177
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,987
They said they were familiar with His Highness

178
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:41,394
Familiar with me

179
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,196
Subordinates do not dare to do whatever they want

180
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,897
So he was escorted back

181
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,232
Bring it here and see

182
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:47,200
yes

183
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:06,619
So many people

184
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:07,753
meet again

185
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:09,822
Why are you

186
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,058
you know

187
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,626
Of course I know

188
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,662
Especially this girl Zhao

189
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,999
We're already engaged. Don't think about it.

190
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,868
Pity

191
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:23,936
Princess

192
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:25,438
I chose this one

193
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:28,307
Princess

194
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:29,976
What are these?

195
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,344
What kind of person

196
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,349
Yeli Langlie, you should go down too.

197
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,590
Persuading Queen Yeli about this matter

198
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,591
I think it's feasible

199
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:47,627
But the flower tree

200
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:48,628
Your identity

201
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:49,896
There is no need to disclose it for the time being.

202
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:52,098
In case everything goes wrong for everyone

203
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,400
You will be the last chance

204
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:59,338
What is the name of the identity you bought?

205
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:00,673
Noriyoshi

206
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:02,341
So ugly

207
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:03,843
I can’t pick one that sounds good.

208
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:04,977
Can I choose this?

209
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:05,778
Separate Separate

210
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,314
You two, please don't quarrel later.

211
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,149
OK

212
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,521
Just think of it as giving

213
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,656
Chief of Qizhai

214
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:17,557
a face

215
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,064
You are from Song Dynasty

216
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,300
absolutely true

217
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,734
The matter of guarding the sheep god

218
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,002
It's the Song people's conspiracy

219
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:30,903
Not a conspiracy

220
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,171
Isn't it a conspiracy?

221
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,239
it's for him

222
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,142
for you

223
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,578
I don't understand this at all

224
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,278
you forgot us

225
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:40,613
The agreement made three years ago?

226
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:43,950
You two still have an agreement

227
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,754
Very good

228
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,323
Everyone is here

229
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:52,425
Let me introduce it first

230
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,026
Song Dynasty

231
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:55,628
Want to kill my father

232
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:56,796
Xiaren

233
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,297
I also want to kill my father

234
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,232
You actually cooperated with Song Ren

235
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:01,500
sincerely

236
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,336
Lessons from the sun

237
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:04,737
We agreed then

238
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:06,872
I'll kill your father for you

239
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,441
But you failed

240
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,308
Sheep Guardian

241
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,077
It was our second assassination

242
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:11,978
Wrong?

243
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:13,613
Three years ago you

244
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,147
First time visiting Helan Mountain

245
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:16,682
The Apparition of the Sheep God

246
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:17,783
Already appeared

247
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:20,052
Did you remember the wrong order?

248
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:21,654
good

249
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,255
Let me introduce to you

250
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,291
this

251
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,226
Deputy Chief of the Secret Pavilion Bazhai

252
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:28,194
Wenwuqi

253
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,830
This Chu Niao Chu girl

254
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,834
The Sheep God is originally the layout of Bazhai

255
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,435
But now I think

256
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:37,703
we can totally

257
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:38,671
Let's work together

258
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,840
Anyway, everyone has the same goal

259
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:42,274
Kill Yuan Hao

260
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:43,776
Different paths to the same destination

261
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:45,678
Temporarily deputy chief

262
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,279
Soon he will be the chief

263
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,749
There's really no need to explain this

264
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:50,549
besides

265
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,351
Guarding the Sheep God

266
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,853
I made the layout alone

267
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,121
It has nothing to do with Chu Niao

268
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:58,858
Chu Niao

269
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:01,193
after today

270
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,895
You are no longer a member of Bazhai

271
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:03,963
What you call kindness

272
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:04,830
Already paid off

273
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:06,298
The overall situation has been determined

274
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,100
I don't need you here anymore

275
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,869
then where should i go

276
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,107
Let's go back to Song Dynasty

277
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,376
Go the way you like

278
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:18,711
your affairs

279
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,513
I have no interest in listening at all.

280
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,715
Since it is a Song Dynasty

281
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:24,650
Why did you kill my father?

282
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,852
It’s true that God’s blessing is true

283
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:28,454
With divine power

284
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,223
This will make everyone fear Yuan Hao

285
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,758
But the other way around

286
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,493
given by gods

287
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:35,795
Nature can also be deprived

288
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:37,997
Makes sense

289
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:39,598
but not enough

290
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:40,599
Of course it's not enough

291
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:41,867
Don't hide it from the queen

292
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,103
We have united the army with the capital of Youzhou

293
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,104
forge an alliance

294
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:47,473
Conspiracy

295
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,041
Now it’s up to you, the Queen

296
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,776
You mean Liang Gewei?

297
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,311
It was Liang Du who commanded the army

298
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,280
Do you mean Liang Gewei?

299
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,149
Cooperate with you guys

300
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,784
I knew the Queen wouldn't believe it.

301
00:11:59,118 --> 00:11:59,985
To be fair to you all

302
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:01,587
Liang Du's army is already here

303
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:02,655
On the way here

304
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:04,423
True or False

305
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:05,958
The queen knew in a blink of an eye

306
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:10,162
Queen Yeli

307
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,931
Already in alliance with you

308
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:12,932
Exactly

309
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:14,600
Queen Yeli and us

310
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,468
Feel like old friends at first sight

311
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:18,070
Immediately join forces to work together for great things

312
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:19,972
Now it's you

313
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:24,443
Queen

314
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,579
It’s so easy to get involved

315
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,615
The queen's tent is just ahead

316
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:30,883
True or False

317
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,752
Liang Du's army knew in a blink of an eye

318
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:39,492
Horse exploration report

319
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:40,993
Liang Gewei, the commander of the Youzhou capital

320
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,228
Approaching the camp

321
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:43,829
It's actually true

322
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,736
You actually convinced Liang Gewei

323
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:52,905
Prince

324
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:53,839
Queen

325
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,708
Youzhou Military Supervisory Department has strong combat effectiveness

326
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,042
Can be a helping hand

327
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,312
Come

328
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,815
Quickly untie these young heroes

329
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:03,783
Have a banquet

330
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:08,320
the door is open

331
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,156
Someone came out

332
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,866
Why did the Dutong Army come?

333
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,668
The queen has already set up a banquet

334
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:23,636
Waiting for you

335
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:25,738
It's actually true

336
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,340
He actually convinced the queen

337
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,584
All the troops have arrived

338
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:53,899
Du Tongjun

339
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:56,101
Her Imperial Highness the Empress

340
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,137
His Royal Highness

341
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,638
Liang Gewei

342
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:01,173
late

343
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,441
Please get up quickly, the Tongtong Army

344
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,312
Dutongjun is loyal and courageous

345
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,113
All the troops are here

346
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:09,949
My young descendant

347
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,317
I have someone to rely on.

348
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,054
Seeing this scene of yours

349
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,224
My death is worth it

350
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,096
One is better at acting than the other

351
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:25,497
Okay, okay.

352
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:26,332
Don't say it anymore. Don't say it anymore.

353
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,601
Congratulations Queen

354
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:29,268
Congratulations Prince

355
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,035
Congratulations to Du Tongjun

356
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,904
The weather is finally sunny in Xixia

357
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:41,714
Her Imperial Highness the Empress

358
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,787
Yeli meets beggar

359
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,158
Have a grudge against Liang

360
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,027
pity

361
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,732
The benefactor died young

362
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,801
Fortunately, the queen is still alive

363
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,037
This is ok

364
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:06,672
I can finally apply

365
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:13,879
This happened

366
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:17,082
Brother Yeli and I are like brothers

367
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:23,822
But

368
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:25,958
My two brothers

369
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,761
Already returned to the Holy Mountain

370
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,864
Qing Tianzi

371
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,666
too harsh

372
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,134
Summer

373
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:36,869
What is needed is His Highness

374
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:37,836
Such a king

375
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,242
son

376
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:44,743
Queen Mother

377
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,812
Liang Du commanded the army

378
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,181
Be like brothers with your uncle

379
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,916
There is a brotherly love

380
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,718
According to that

381
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,920
They can also be considered your parents.

382
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,457
I would like to worship Tongjun as my adoptive father

383
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:00,993
Your Highness

384
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:02,861
This old minister can't bear it

385
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:04,997
Calling foster father shows how close he is to you

386
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:05,931
Your Highness

387
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:07,733
Your Highness is the Prince

388
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,601
The prince has a foster father

389
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:10,803
this

390
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,671
this is inappropriate

391
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,040
Murphy

392
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:16,942
Liang Du commanded the army

393
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:18,711
Do you dislike me?

394
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:19,945
Not this or this

395
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,514
This this

396
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:24,783
this

397
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,352
It’s okay to have individual righteousness

398
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,255
How about the foster uncle?

399
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,292
Ashamed Ashamed

400
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:36,895
Father-in-law

401
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:38,430
Your Highness

402
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:40,899
Brother-in-law

403
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:42,334
Sister-in-law

404
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,170
No, I'm going to vomit.

405
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,305
Hold on a little longer

406
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,474
Brother, please take a seat quickly

407
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,942
Participate in the grand event

408
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:51,710
uncle

409
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:52,978
please

410
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:54,613
please

411
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,748
please

412
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:57,082
please

413
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:00,419
Everyone

414
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:01,787
Please take a seat too

415
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:05,824
Finally let’s talk about business

416
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:12,798
I won't talk anymore.

417
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:14,500
Where are you going?

418
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:16,668
I have something to tell her

419
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:20,305
Go ahead

420
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:40,759
take this as faith

421
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,261
There are no taboos in the tent

422
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:43,896
You can go wherever you want

423
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,735
Is there a quieter tent?

424
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,111
The tent over there is piled with luggage.

425
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:00,412
With it

426
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,713
Just go in directly

427
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:03,582
thank you

428
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,132
What did Wen Wuqi say just now?

429
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,500
I don’t want you to be in danger again

430
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,302
I didn’t really drive you out of Bazhai.

431
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:24,703
I know

432
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,971
you know

433
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,641
The Death of Old Tang

434
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,543
Mr. Wen is more sad than me

435
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,979
He is thinking about all the dangers that will follow

436
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:35,681
I carried it all by myself.

437
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:37,883
Actually quite good

438
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:38,417
look

439
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,152
Now there are so many people in the alliance

440
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,187
On the army side, there is the Yuzhou Military Supervisory Department

441
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:43,388
Where is the court?

442
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:44,456
There is the prince Ning Lingge

443
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:45,757
Tribal side

444
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,559
The Yeli clan still has some power left

445
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,429
In addition, the Sheep God rebuked Yuan Hao

446
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,197
Four parties work together

447
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:53,599
Eradicating Yuan Hao is no longer a big problem

448
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,101
so

449
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,302
The big thing is settled

450
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:58,670
You don't have to take risks anymore

451
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,339
Just like Wen Wuqi said

452
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,040
The favor you want to repay

453
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:02,975
It has been paid off long ago

454
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:05,677
I am

455
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,679
I don't know where to go all of a sudden

456
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:08,881
what to do

457
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:11,517
I now

458
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:13,185
Have your own business

459
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:14,753
If you really have nowhere to go

460
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:16,321
Don't dislike it

461
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:17,789
You can come to me in the future

462
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:18,824
Help me with the accounts

463
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:22,394
Didn't you say

464
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,196
your favorite

465
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:25,430
Just clothes to reach out

466
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:26,465
The kind that opens your mouth after eating

467
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:27,266
Leisure days?

468
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,069
Actually I like it too

469
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:36,575
But I'm already disabled

470
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,377
It's alright

471
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,079
Mr. Wen also said that I was mentally immature.

472
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,181
This counts

473
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,482
I'm pretty handicapped too.

474
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:45,184
You see we are all disabled

475
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:46,018
Then

476
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:47,920
That's quite appropriate

477
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,656
Wen rarely says that people are mentally retarded

478
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:51,690
Not talking about you specifically

479
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:54,660
I'll pay for some thugs

480
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:55,827
Turn around and beat him up

481
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:56,995
OK

482
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,498
That's settled

483
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:00,933
Wait till Yuan Hao dies

484
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,201
We all went back to Song Dynasty

485
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:03,535
I'll just spend some money to buy some thugs

486
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:04,836
If nothing happens, beat Wen Wuqi

487
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:05,837
Let's have fun

488
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,339
Don't let Hua Shao go either

489
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:08,674
Don't let the two deputy mayors go.

490
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:10,676
Both of them are quite annoying.

491
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:11,510
no problem

492
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,277
Fight together

493
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:18,517
Thank you Yanei

494
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:20,919
I am serious

495
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,421
Don't because

496
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,156
You feel sorry for yourself when you see me hurt

497
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,257
this is not good

498
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,158
Not a grievance

499
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,026
really not

500
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,163
I don’t know what to say either.

501
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:33,298
Anyway, I'm serious

502
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:37,669
Is your business profitable?

503
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:38,403
Quite profitable

504
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:39,738
It's OK to eat meat every day

505
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:41,940
You will never be poor if you eat for the rest of your life

506
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:44,977
But I’m not very good at accounting.

507
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,311
It doesn't matter

508
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,279
Looking for a cashier?

509
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,580
Just name it

510
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:50,515
Is that appropriate?

511
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:51,583
Suitable

512
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:52,751
Is there anything inappropriate?

513
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:54,052
You are the hostess.

514
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:55,587
Let's get there

515
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,155
Eat delicious food and drink spicy food every day

516
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,590
Traveling around

517
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,159
Be as happy as you want

518
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:02,694
sounds great

519
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:03,495
That's settled

520
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:05,797
OK

521
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,532
good

522
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:12,938
What's wrong

523
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,185
This halberd

524
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,054
I have seen

525
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,458
I've seen it too

526
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,066
This is Yuan Hao's weapon

527
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,801
How could it appear in

528
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,669
Baggage camp tent

529
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:45,837
Yuan Hao has been hiding in the camp

530
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:47,306
how come

531
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,240
He deliberately let Brother Ning Ling

532
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:48,840
Queen Yeli

533
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,641
Coming to Helan Mountain

534
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,042
quick

535
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:50,876
Reminder

536
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:19,037
After all, she is her own queen

537
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:20,772
Another biological son

538
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:24,109
Why did I come secretly with you?

539
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,611
Because I value feelings

540
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:28,747
Sheep Guardian

541
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,315
Youzhou Army

542
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,550
All ready

543
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:34,386
Good

544
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:37,856
Yanei

545
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:41,760
I've never heard of it in my life

546
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,196
Words that make people happier than before

547
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,836
This man loves my concubine.

548
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:54,172
another

549
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:17,629
Chu Niao

550
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:20,499
Chu Niao

551
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,140
Chu Niao

552
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:49,828
You idiot

553
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:52,063
How can I ask for it if I don’t know how to manage accounts?

554
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:53,498
Except for you.

555
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:54,699
You're welcome

556
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:51,509
You all have been following me for many years

557
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:52,611
go through fire and water

558
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:54,779
No more nonsense

559
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,348
things are simple

560
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,750
Someone is plotting rebellion in the camp

561
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,518
You follow me and fight in

562
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,854
Except for the Queen and the Crown Prince

563
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:04,022
You can kill them all

564
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:04,856
yes

565
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,091
If it becomes a big thing

566
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:07,659
Daxia Military and Political Affairs

567
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,494
Divide and conquer with uncle

568
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:11,162
Don't dare

569
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:29,514
what happened

570
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:35,620
The king appears in the camp

571
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:37,155
Leading the team to attack here

572
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:40,959
Yuan Hao

573
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:42,894
Isn't he in Xingqing Mansion?

574
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,162
How many people did he bring?

575
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:45,230
Dozens of armor

576
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,398
Dozens of armor

577
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,733
I checked the tent many times

578
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:50,135
There's no way we can hide so many people

579
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:50,869
Imperial villa

580
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,103
He is from the palace

581
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,171
They sent people and horses here

582
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:54,939
That seems to have been planned.

583
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:58,109
Just dozens of people

584
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,344
Have the opportunity

585
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:00,979
The soldiers in the camp saw the king

586
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:02,881
Throw away your armor and lose your fighting power

587
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:04,949
To advance or to retreat

588
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:06,151
Make your decision early

589
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,786
Isn't this a good opportunity to kill him?

590
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:10,822
let's go

591
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:13,858
uncle

592
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,363
He's right

593
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,132
This is a good opportunity to kill Yuan Hao

594
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:22,100
Walk

595
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:24,102
Aren’t you contradicting yourself?

596
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:26,738
The entire camp is filled with Yuan Hao’s old troops.

597
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,106
Can't stop him at all

598
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,542
Good thing it's around here

599
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,877
I have a Yuzhou army

600
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:37,315
It turns out that Liang Du commanded the army

601
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:38,616
Always have military horses on hand

602
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:41,119
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

603
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:46,424
Taking precautions before they happen is a matter of course

604
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:47,992
Nothing to say hello to

605
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:50,095
Yuan Hao left the army

606
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:52,497
This is a good opportunity to kill him

607
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:55,033
I'm going to mobilize my troops and come back quickly.

608
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:58,136
Take this opportunity to change the national destiny of Daxia

609
00:28:58,703 --> 00:28:59,304
etc.

610
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,674
uncle

611
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:05,376
Go through the back door

612
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,778
I left a way out

613
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:08,813
The wooden fence behind the tent

614
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:09,414
There is a gap

615
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,381
Can leave camp directly

616
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:12,383
Uncle is right

617
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,852
I hold my father back

618
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:15,653
Come back as soon as possible

619
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:17,756
His Royal Highness

620
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:19,157
You can't stay here either

621
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:20,391
i must stay

622
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:20,992
No

623
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:22,627
Why should those who do great things regret their lives?

624
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:25,497
Everything depends on

625
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:26,865
Liang Du took over the army

626
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:28,299
I stay too

627
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:30,468
Queen Mother

628
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:32,670
You might as well go together

629
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:35,039
I am still the queen of Daxia

630
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:36,741
Stop dawdling and leave

631
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:43,615
Yanei and Chu Niao haven't come back yet

632
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,016
The two of them went to the supply camp

633
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,384
Go find someone

634
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:48,153
The king came from that direction.

635
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:50,622
can not go

636
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:51,856
Save Yanei

637
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:53,992
We can't all be stuck here

638
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:06,437
Walk

639
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:37,635
You are not afraid

640
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:38,736
Life and death

641
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:42,941
This is the boy from the Nori family

642
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:45,376
Noriyoshi

643
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:46,411
Follow me soon

644
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:48,746
Can be of great use

645
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:54,752
take it easy

646
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,322
If you really want to kill me

647
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,390
We won’t just take dozens of people with us

648
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:05,063
wait for him to come

649
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:24,549
Where to go now?

650
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:27,151
advanced mountain

651
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:27,819
etc.

652
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,854
Current situation

653
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:31,589
The Youzhou Army plays an important role

654
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:33,658
I'll keep an eye on Liang Gewei first.

655
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:34,626
OK

656
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:36,261
Let Xue Ying go with you

657
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:38,029
good

658
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,330
Xue Ying

659
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,332
let's go now

660
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:43,034
This is definitely not to leave the office alone.

661
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:46,905
I understand the chief

662
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:48,506
Wait for the Youzhou army to come back

663
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:49,474
can save Yanei

664
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:50,875
current situation

665
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:51,876
The most taboo is hesitation

666
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:52,911
Must make a prompt decision

667
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:26,911
Going up the mountain

668
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:30,014
Walk

669
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,031
Liang Du commanded the army

670
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:52,103
I told you to disperse earlier

671
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:53,171
what to do with me

672
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,539
Are you afraid that I will break my promise?

673
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:57,041
We want to help the capital unify the army

674
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:57,976
A helping hand

675
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:02,613
Keep up

676
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,615
The barracks is not far from here

677
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:05,984
Walk

678
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,495
The shouts of killing in the camp have stopped

679
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,682
After all, it is the left wing army

680
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:39,550
My father has been in charge for many years

681
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:40,852
As soon as he appears

682
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,522
In all likelihood, it will drop.

683
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:46,758
He did this on purpose

684
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,394
Let’s come to Helan Mountain

685
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:09,013
Where is the father?

686
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:18,156
He's not in the camp

687
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:18,116
Kings

688
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:22,653
Brother Ning Ling looks like me

689
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,921
ambitious

690
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:25,556
After all, he is my son

691
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:32,363
Liang Gewei

692
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,498
stop looking

693
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:34,699
just me

694
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,236
How long have we not seen each other?

695
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:43,274
a year or two

696
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,011
you always refuse to leave

697
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:48,546
The camp of Youzhou Army

698
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:50,781
It’s really hard to meet you

699
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:51,983
Being involved in military affairs

700
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:53,184
Also helpless

701
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:55,319
What a coincidence today

702
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:56,854
I am in Helan Mountain

703
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,590
I learned that the Queen and His Highness were also there

704
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:01,459
Just wanted to say hello

705
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:03,261
what hello

706
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:04,262
how to fight

707
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:06,664
All of them

708
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:07,999
commonplace

709
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:10,701
What I hate the most is ordinary speech

710
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:14,906
People should be blazing and crazy when they are alive

711
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:16,874
commonplace

712
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:18,643
Just nonsense

713
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:20,878
Liang Gewei

714
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,713
between the two of me

715
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,415
Why not be frank?

716
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:25,983
Kings

717
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,752
How to confess

718
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,590
I am going to kill you

719
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:36,427
Youzhou Army

720
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:38,596
It has always been my biggest worry.

721
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:40,464
I want to kill you directly

722
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:42,833
There is no good excuse for civil unrest

723
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:45,937
I think about it day and night

724
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:48,506
I finally figured it out

725
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:50,775
I will release Brother Ning Ling

726
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,276
This is the best fishing bait

727
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:55,513
That's your son

728
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:58,883
biological fishing bait

729
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:00,251
Very easy to use

730
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:06,490
Yuan Zhongxin

731
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:08,059
meet again

732
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:10,228
Thank you

733
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,431
Bring Liang Gewei to me

734
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,802
If I conspire with him

735
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,303
He can't say this

736
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:23,307
I set up camp

737
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:24,909
Not far ahead

738
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,277
Let's try it first

739
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:28,312
It's best to kill

740
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:30,081
Xiao Xue

741
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:31,482
If you can't kill

742
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:33,351
The two of us hold Yuan Hao down

743
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:35,052
Let Liang Du lead the army to mobilize troops

744
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,722
Have you finished talking?

745
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:38,456
Xiao Xue

746
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:49,533
Return to camp and move troops

747
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:51,035
quick

748
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:04,815
you become stronger

749
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:20,197
Have you been seriously injured before?

750
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:19,957
What are you doing here?

751
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:22,026
There's something hidden in there

752
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:24,061
Who is buried?

753
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:25,429
have no idea

754
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,464
Whatever you choose

755
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:29,266
You really don't believe in ghosts.

756
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,202
I said hello

757
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:33,671
what hello

758
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:35,306
I burned incense

759
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:36,774
I said it was love that had to be done

760
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:38,576
If there is really a bad ghost that is alarmed,

761
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:40,411
The wrongdoer has his head, and the debtor has his owner

762
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:41,912
Secret Pavilion Bazhai of the Great Song Dynasty

763
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:42,980
The life of the flower tree

764
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:44,582
They just take it

765
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:47,017
Is this appropriate?

766
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:48,185
fine

767
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:49,720
usual flower tree

768
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,021
I swear on my life too

769
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:52,523
Come and help

770
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:21,585
Kid

771
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:23,421
Who prompted you?

772
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:25,122
Made a lot of progress

773
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:28,359
Not quite right

774
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:31,662
He didn't try his best

775
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:45,443
Just a few people

776
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:49,980
There are a little less people

777
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:52,416
As long as you can see and speak

778
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,261
Liang Du commanded the army

779
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:06,297
You should know

780
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:08,332
Battlefield Capture the Flag

781
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:09,733
most important

782
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:11,235
Why

783
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,772
Once the battle flag falls, the morale of the army will be in chaos

784
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:16,841
That's right

785
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:18,476
Military morale

786
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:19,944
most subtle

787
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,214
But the general of an army

788
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:25,583
Heavier than a military flag

789
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:31,655
He did it on purpose

790
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,257
What

791
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:34,625
He just wants to

792
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:35,392
In front of the Youzhou Army

793
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:36,060
kill you

794
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:38,028
Let the Youzhou Army see him from now on

795
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:39,430
Feeling fear

796
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:42,666
That's right

797
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,001
Xiao Xue

798
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:23,974
father

799
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:51,936
father

800
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:54,104
father

801
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:56,140
father

802
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:58,042
Dad, I'm here

803
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:01,145
Daddy

804
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:03,948
father

805
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,185
Daddy

806
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:10,854
father

807
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:13,090
father

808
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:19,797
father

809
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:21,899
father

810
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:23,500
father

811
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:29,873
Pity

812
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:31,875
Not a long sword
