1
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:00,353
Yanei

2
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:36,556
Go fast

3
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:37,457
Walk

4
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,002
Is it annoying?

5
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,573
It's okay, keep drinking

6
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,522
How many of you go over there?

7
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:17,824
Others follow me.

8
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:18,992
Yes Yes

9
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,515
There are no traces of assassins under the cliff

10
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:43,583
pursuing

11
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,192
It's me who killed

12
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:54,861
You're okay again

13
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,196
Eat and drink when you should

14
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:58,965
Be happy

15
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,306
Father is right

16
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,409
One or two assassins don't need to worry

17
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,511
sons and ministers

18
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,280
A toast to my father

19
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,561
You really drink it

20
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,363
Father's Order

21
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:32,265
Don't dare to disobey

22
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,767
You can't say that

23
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,836
What if the wine is poisonous?

24
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,038
You're not the one who poisoned me.

25
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,007
How do you know if it's poisonous?

26
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,075
Sons and ministers are stupid

27
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:43,509
heart

28
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,346
Only respect and love for the father

29
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,047
Didn't think so much

30
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,982
Life is still important

31
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,584
Children and ministers receive education

32
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:54,620
Where is the Prime Minister?

33
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:56,756
Go and find him for me

34
00:05:59,158 --> 00:05:59,826
Prime Minister

35
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,861
Yuan Hao this time

36
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:03,262
It will destroy Brother Ning Ling

37
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,297
The position of prince?

38
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,898
They were all poisoned and assassinated.

39
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:07,033
Not abolished yet

40
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,269
In fact, you and I have no grudges

41
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:11,604
these things i do

42
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,873
Itâ€™s all just for Brother Ning Ling

43
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,483
Afraid I'll kill you

44
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,156
Prime Minister Qing Tianzi is looking for you

45
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:57,316
Qing Tianzi

46
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:00,887
Prime Minister

47
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,791
You tell me before the banquet

48
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,026
Queen meets assassin

49
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,462
I didn't believe it at first

50
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:10,997
But who would have thought

51
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,799
There really is an assassin

52
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,902
Qingtianzi is protected by gods

53
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,036
Naturally fine

54
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,806
The queen knew the assassin

55
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,307
There is no such thing

56
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,645
That means you are talking nonsense.

57
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:27,113
Except for the minister

58
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,915
There are also guards who testified.

59
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,257
In my wine just now

60
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:39,559
Poisoned

61
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,527
Assassins deserve death

62
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,564
The rest of the wine

63
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:45,898
Do you dare to drink?

64
00:07:58,377 --> 00:07:59,912
My brother is not good at drinking

65
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:02,315
This wine minister and his concubine drink for him

66
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,191
Qingtianzi gives wine

67
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:14,060
Can't refuse

68
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,780
Someone attempted assassination at the banquet

69
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,121
Yuan Hao is sending people to search

70
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:53,593
why are you here

71
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,628
I still think about it

72
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,463
It's important to protect you first

73
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,002
Has anyone been caught in the assassination?

74
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,604
Maybe not

75
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,405
They all jumped off the cliff and escaped

76
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:09,308
Let's go first

77
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:12,078
Dragon God Dragon God

78
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,913
If you want to leave the palace

79
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,114
It's closer here

80
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:17,483
stay home

81
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:18,918
No

82
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,353
They all jumped off the cliff and escaped

83
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,198
The Prime Minister is not dead

84
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:33,966
This incidates that

85
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,002
Only the wine in the glass is poisonous

86
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,004
Is there any in the jug?

87
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,440
before this

88
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,542
Only the queen has ever poured me wine

89
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:46,078
Understood

90
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,314
The Prime Minister delivers the order for me

91
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:49,782
From today

92
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,717
Abolished the position of Queen Norishi

93
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,120
Your Majesty, please think twice.

94
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,489
The harem cannot be left without a master for a day

95
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,158
Queen's throne

96
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,960
Just leave it to your sister

97
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,602
Thank you Qingtianzi for the reward

98
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,478
Since I am no longer the queen

99
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:21,147
Naturally, without a face

100
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:23,115
Exit

101
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:47,940
Prince

102
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,578
I heard the Prime Minister say

103
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,046
Conspirators with assassins

104
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,181
And you

105
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:56,315
Absolutely no such thing

106
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,517
The Prime Minister must have made a mistake

107
00:11:58,684 --> 00:11:59,385
look

108
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,021
I just said you got it wrong

109
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,289
Okay, it's okay

110
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,297
Why are you still kneeling? Prime Minister

111
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,598
Find a place to sit

112
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:13,899
The party is still going on

113
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,235
I read that right

114
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:18,704
Prime Minister

115
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,741
How can a father and his son kill each other?

116
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,109
Unreasonable

117
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,044
Think about it again

118
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,183
What the king said is absolutely true

119
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:33,686
I may have seen it wrong.

120
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:35,821
Please forgive me

121
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:38,457
What crime have you committed?

122
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,025
You are also dedicated to serving the country.

123
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,430
The prince pays a toast to the prime minister

124
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:45,598
yes

125
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:58,444
The Prime Minister is coming

126
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,981
You really have a good idea

127
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:04,316
The younger generation must learn from you

128
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,385
The prince is serious.

129
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,487
The Prince's Deep Cunning

130
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,189
That's amazing

131
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:11,524
Invite the Prime Minister

132
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:12,258
Come

133
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,618
This is used for storage in the summer

134
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:40,719
No one in winter

135
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,621
There is a cliff behind

136
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,157
It is quite convenient to hide and escape

137
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,641
He and the others did not escape from the palace

138
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,510
Do the opposite

139
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,111
This is the hiding place

140
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:08,881
But Yuanhao's guard is extremely tight

141
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,950
How did they escape here?

142
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,386
Could it be that you used your magic power?

143
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,392
If I could use my magic power at will

144
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:22,328
Do you still need to hide?

145
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:26,699
clear

146
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,001
This is Helan Mountain

147
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:30,636
They have many gods

148
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:31,904
To control

149
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:33,439
Just stay down there for now

150
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,041
clear

151
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:51,924
Why did you do it?

152
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,926
Wasn't it Queen Yeli who poisoned her?

153
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,696
Failed

154
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,265
It doesn't matter

155
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,666
I'm also poisoned here

156
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:06,739
I have to thank Hua Shao

157
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,040
No arrangements for you

158
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,208
We're not that suitable either

159
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,276
Hiding Place

160
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,515
Why don't you say anything?

161
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:18,817
Where are Sister Zhao and Brother Wang?

162
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:33,632
Yanei

163
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,634
you were rescued

164
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,139
Brother Wang is injured

165
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,707
All because of saving me

166
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,275
I should save you

167
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,196
Is the person still alive?

168
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,464
alive

169
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:07,599
Can the bleeding be stopped?

170
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,469
Try to prevent the wound from getting too big

171
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,504
I'll stop the bleeding

172
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:15,341
Yanei

173
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:17,309
exist

174
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,478
Help me find some charcoal

175
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:21,347
good

176
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,417
Gotta keep the office busy

177
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,319
Can't let self-blame destroy him

178
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:29,288
Small Scene

179
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:30,990
Small Scene

180
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,858
I will definitely save Brother Wang

181
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:39,164
Prince

182
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,268
I remember to get you engaged

183
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:43,902
right

184
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,305
Returning to my father, this is indeed the case

185
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,140
The girl who didnâ€™t move home

186
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,874
Yes or no

187
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:49,942
Exactly

188
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,646
The wedding should be on these days, right?

189
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:55,581
That's right

190
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:56,682
In a few days

191
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,317
My son is about to return to Xingqing Mansion

192
00:16:58,751 --> 00:16:59,585
Getting ready for marriage

193
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:02,354
Don't go back to Xingqing Mansion

194
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:04,323
Let's go to the palace while the excitement is lively.

195
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:04,990
OK

196
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,459
Everything is up to the Father

197
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:08,827
good

198
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,864
I'll make the change

199
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,266
It's better to change the date

200
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,634
Father

201
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,670
In fact, my son is not in a hurry to get married.

202
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,272
The days won't change.

203
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:21,807
Change people

204
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:25,944
Previous stage time

205
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:29,281
I've seen that girl who hasn't moved home yet

206
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:31,216
feel happy

207
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:39,825
this bride

208
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,460
I'll marry her for you.

209
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,137
Being favored by the father

210
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,007
Itâ€™s the familyâ€™s luck that hasnâ€™t changed

211
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:01,113
good

212
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,148
You can't leave

213
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,584
You have to give a toast at the wedding

214
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:09,521
That's natural

215
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,358
I'll toast to the prince again

216
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,628
The prince's magnanimity is unparalleled

217
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:27,840
please

218
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:47,826
I want to find charcoal for Wang Kuan

219
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:49,228
Don't leave this building

220
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,729
Wang Kuan wants charcoal

221
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:51,663
let me go

222
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,665
I'll just come and find you

223
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:54,833
You wait

224
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,767
Wang Kuan is here to save me

225
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:56,802
Thatâ€™s why it hurt like this

226
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,141
I saw with my own eyes my colleague Yashiya

227
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,308
die in front of eyes

228
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:04,910
but can't do anything

229
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,712
We can't even die together

230
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:08,881
Wang Kuan is still there

231
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,315
Don't mess around

232
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:20,325
I see

233
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,793
I'm going to find charcoal

234
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:44,983
Tie shoulders with rope

235
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:46,218
Tie tight

236
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,954
Can the bleeding be stopped?

237
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:49,922
Or not

238
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,528
An injury like this can't stop the bleeding

239
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:58,897
he will die

240
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:11,276
Get out of here

241
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:26,658
Even if this is the case, he is still the prince.

242
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,399
Keep your voice down, the walls have ears

243
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:37,402
fine

244
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:39,905
I've seen it for you

245
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:42,608
No one but me

246
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:08,767
Someone coming

247
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:13,605
Drink it

248
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:15,007
yes

249
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:28,487
Carry away

250
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:31,790
come over

251
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,761
Where is Wei Zhuoran?

252
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,196
After the banquet, I have been kneeling in the snow

253
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:38,997
Refuse to get up

254
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:44,002
This is quite unbearable

255
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:47,472
first

256
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,876
First of all, I wish your sister to become the new queen.

257
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:53,312
You didn't escape

258
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:53,945
Prime Minister

259
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,148
Yuan Hao deposed the queen

260
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,116
But he retained Brother Ning Lingâ€™s

261
00:21:58,116 --> 00:21:59,117
The Crown Prince

262
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:00,919
Are you quite disappointed?

263
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:02,120
catch you

264
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,323
Ning Lingge's crime of collaborating with the enemy

265
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,424
You can sit down

266
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:06,758
Why should Yuan Hao keep it?

267
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:08,126
Ning Linggeâ€™s position as prince

268
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:11,363
Is it because of the deep love between father and son?

269
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:13,899
Qingtianzi announced in public

270
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,967
Seize Ning Linggeâ€™s newlywed wife

271
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,603
If the father and son love is deep

272
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,339
He would not humiliate Brother Ning Ling like this

273
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,307
He knows that Brother Ning Ling hates him

274
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:24,309
So I want to humiliate him in public

275
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,144
But why did he

276
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:27,713
Keep his position as crown prince

277
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:30,349
Prime Minister

278
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,918
all because of you

279
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:34,686
In fact, in your own heart

280
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,321
Already know the answer

281
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:37,756
My sister is now

282
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:38,790
become the new queen

283
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,726
Ning Linggeâ€™s position as prince

284
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:41,660
If it is deposed again

285
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:44,429
You donâ€™t have a hidden clan

286
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:47,199
No one will be able to control it

287
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,901
He just wants me to be with Brother Ning Ling

288
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,137
Mutual hatred

289
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:54,873
The more you fight, the more fierce you become

290
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:57,209
Yuan Hao felt even more pleased

291
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,344
So the Prime Minister

292
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,513
Even if you hand me over

293
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:03,849
He wonâ€™t cripple Brother Ning Ling either.

294
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:06,318
not necessarily

295
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,353
If the Prime Minister wants to arrest me

296
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:11,223
I've called someone a long time ago.

297
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,160
What's your last name?

298
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:16,962
Surname Yuan

299
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:18,163
Yuan Xiaoge

300
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,965
Don't you hate us?

301
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:21,266
why do i hate you

302
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,101
I hate my brother for betraying you

303
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:25,637
I'm not familiar with him.

304
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:27,105
Is it normal to betray?

305
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:30,842
The Song Dynasty was indeed a place of outstanding people

306
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,310
Look at the young people

307
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:33,645
More knowledgeable

308
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:35,313
Really clever and cute

309
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,149
There are quite a few people who compliment me on my cleverness.

310
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,351
I'm the first one to compliment me on how cute I am

311
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:40,318
Hate

312
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,321
you come here

313
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,624
Just to talk to me about Brother Ning Ling

314
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:46,425
Prime Minister

315
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:48,360
If you want to take charge

316
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:50,595
What do you think of Brother Ning Ling?

317
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,830
Is it your number one enemy?

318
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:52,831
if not

319
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:57,469
With Yuan Hao

320
00:23:58,403 --> 00:23:59,838
There's no chance for you or Brother Ning Ling.

321
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:03,341
I am loyal to Qingtianzi

322
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:04,743
I heard that Yuan Hao recently

323
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,144
Getting married again

324
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,879
This queen was ruined once

325
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:10,449
It will be useless the second time

326
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:14,986
Just alarmist

327
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:15,921
What do you think

328
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,323
How does Brother Ning Ling compare to Yuan Hao?

329
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,357
That's far from it

330
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:20,826
What if Yuan Hao died?

331
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,194
do you think you can

332
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,995
Ning Lingge took it from his hands

333
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:25,464
Is Xixia powerful?

334
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:31,203
Qingtianzi is not kind to me

335
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:32,904
do you want me to

336
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:34,940
Conspiracy?

337
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,808
Back then, the Yeli clan

338
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:38,477
How is the reputation

339
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:40,745
Far better than my brothers and sisters

340
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:41,980
What about now?

341
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:44,483
Almost genocide

342
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:45,116
Prime Minister

343
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,285
You might as well think about their fate

344
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,888
Think again about your fate

345
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:51,456
To put it bluntly, itâ€™s just one sentence

346
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:53,191
Yuan Hao's character

347
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:54,826
How much do you believe?

348
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:58,029
What are your plans today?

349
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,365
Are you sure Yuan Hao didn't see through it?

350
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:02,901
Even if I don't see through it now

351
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,136
Can you ensure that he

352
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,905
Don't you have any doubts?

353
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,474
Qingtianzi is the most powerful person in the world

354
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,042
If I plot against

355
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,879
I'm afraid of being criticized by thousands of people.

356
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:16,848
Xixia is full of talents

357
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:18,149
This pot

358
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:20,485
How can you let the Prime Minister memorize it alone?

359
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,989
What Yuan Xiaoge means is

360
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:26,024
Letâ€™s cooperate with Ning Lingge first

361
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,425
Eradicate Yuan Hao

362
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:30,195
Revenge for Qingtianzi again

363
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,796
Eradicate Brother Ning Ling

364
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:34,699
Prime Minister

365
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,101
Such a vicious strategy

366
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:37,702
Can't you see it yourself?

367
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:39,671
You have to force your sister to tell you.

368
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,476
Just today's matter

369
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,944
I'm afraid it's Brother Ning Ling

370
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:47,746
Hate me so much

371
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,147
Then apologize

372
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:51,683
Very offended

373
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:53,418
Brother, you can be more sincere

374
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:54,786
That's okay too

375
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:55,620
Why not try

376
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:10,402
Father seizes son's wife

377
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,670
I'm grateful he can do it

378
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,704
You don't like it

379
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:14,306
Didn't move that girl

380
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:16,308
Two different things

381
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:18,143
He is stepping on my face and humiliating me

382
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:19,711
This is not called humiliation

383
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:22,347
He just announced to the ministers of the Manchu Dynasty

384
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:24,316
Talk about you, the prince

385
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,017
The future is worrying

386
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:26,885
It's better to go directly

387
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:27,986
Get rid of this prince

388
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,321
Why not abolish it

389
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,356
Don't you know clearly?

390
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:40,799
He made me fight with Wu Zangpang

391
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,702
The more you two fight, the more fiercely you two become.

392
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:46,605
The happier your father will be

393
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,474
He can sit back and relax

394
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,643
The two of us keep spending this much

395
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:54,245
The turmoil of divine punishment in Xingqing Mansion

396
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:55,780
It will disappear

397
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,248
smooth over the waves

398
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:58,883
Take advantage of your fights

399
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:00,719
Attract attention from all parties

400
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:03,321
Then they said this is the Sheep God

401
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:04,990
punishment for you

402
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,525
Give you two what you deserve.

403
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:08,460
retribution

404
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:13,398
Me and I are fighting each other

405
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:16,101
The divine punishment also dissipated

406
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:18,236
This is a combination of elimination and defeat

407
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:20,405
He is safe and sound

408
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:21,940
you finally know

409
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:23,308
Your father

410
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:24,509
not only

411
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:25,977
Are you leading troops to fight?

412
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:28,780
He is waiting

413
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,985
Wait until the divine punishment subsides

414
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:38,256
This is the day when I, the prince, will be deposed.

415
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:41,760
we have no time

416
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:43,428
Your Highness

417
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:45,864
Seeking an audience with the Prime Minister

418
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:47,832
No hidden lies

419
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:49,401
why come again

420
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:52,237
explain

421
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:54,406
The Prime Minister looks arrogant

422
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:55,140
Look

423
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,642
Looks like he's here to scold you

424
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:59,177
quarrel

425
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:00,779
Come to the door and quarrel

426
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:13,458
This medicine can save Wang Kuan's life

427
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:15,360
Just drugged

428
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:17,195
He is already unconscious

429
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,264
I need to let Brother Wang sleep more deeply.

430
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:27,005
Where is the flower tree?

431
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,074
He was called by Queen Yeli

432
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,152
Met the queen

433
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,620
Met the prince

434
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:46,024
Why does the Prime Minister have time to visit?

435
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:48,326
I miss the prince.

436
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:51,996
Besides, I, the Prime Minister of the country,

437
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:53,298
Itâ€™s a life of hard work

438
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:55,266
I have to bear all the chores

439
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:57,235
Under the Prince

440
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,903
There are still several battalions of soldiers and horses

441
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:00,839
their dispatch supplies

442
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,708
It's better to leave it to me to worry about

443
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,745
This is what the father means

444
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:08,913
I figured it out myself

445
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:14,686
You are not afraid

446
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:16,755
I kill you

447
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:17,722
Prince

448
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:20,959
How about you kill me?

449
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:24,796
Get out of here!

450
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,501
Prime Minister

451
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:32,504
Come in and sit

452
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:42,313
Queen and Prince

453
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:49,821
Prime Minister

454
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:53,792
What are you doing here?

455
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:55,527
You and I fight

456
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:57,629
Qingtianzi is happy to hear and see

457
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,299
It was for outsiders to watch.

458
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,767
Isnâ€™t it?

459
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,303
The Prime Minister came here this time

460
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,604
true intention

461
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,605
What is it again?

462
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,310
what is this for

463
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,380
Today's banquet

464
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,116
I was the one who informed Qing Tianzi

465
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:20,418
I wanted to frame the queen and the prince

466
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:21,753
Such behavior

467
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,022
Hateful and shameful

468
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:25,423
Ask the prince for forgiveness

469
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:29,794
Prime Minister

470
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:32,397
Seek a future for your family

471
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:34,799
as a matter of course

472
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:36,301
Reasonable

473
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,904
If you make a mistake, you should be punished

474
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:45,844
What kind of punishment are you doing?

475
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:47,912
Do you have a stick?

476
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:51,683
A whip is also OK

477
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:55,620
It's the trick of asking for forgiveness.

478
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:57,488
What stands out is a word

479
00:30:58,389 --> 00:30:59,123
sincere

480
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,834
Burning the wound can stop bleeding

481
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:11,703
Stop the bleeding first, then save lives

482
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,297
Let me do it

483
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:41,699
I'm here to save

484
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,816
The wooden stick is fine without this

485
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:36,721
this

486
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:39,257
bring it on

487
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:41,926
Beat the prince to calm him down

488
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:48,032
Okay, okay.

489
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:49,367
let it go

490
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:52,403
Get up

491
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:54,205
I really won't fight anymore

492
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,039
hurry up

493
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:55,707
okay

494
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:59,844
Do you still dare to believe him?

495
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:02,880
I don't trust his character.

496
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,315
I believe in human nature

497
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:11,356
I wanted to overthrow the prince.

498
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:13,024
After all, my sister

499
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:14,325
Also gave birth to a prince

500
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,027
Prince, can you understand?

501
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,328
I understand.

502
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,763
but now i understand

503
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,832
This is wrong

504
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:22,767
Is there something wrong with this?

505
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:24,969
The Blue Emperor's Great Talent and Strategy

506
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:26,037
He is here

507
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,272
Those of us who are fighting for power

508
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:29,674
No way to survive

509
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:31,743
So you come to me

510
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,445
That change is a bit too fast, right?

511
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,680
no way

512
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:37,782
If you donâ€™t change quickly, you will die quickly.

513
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,351
I reconsidered

514
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:42,620
Blood is thicker than water

515
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:46,190
To be honest, the prince is the wise master

516
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:49,327
Why is blood thicker than water?

517
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:51,329
We are relatives

518
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:53,297
My sister

519
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:56,501
She was the wife of Yeli Yuqi.

520
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:57,435
And the Queen

521
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:00,138
She is the biological sister of Yeli Yuqi

522
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:01,305
Calculating it this way

523
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:03,941
The Queen and I are also siblings.

524
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:05,443
That His Highness

525
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,278
Wouldnâ€™t he become my nephew?

526
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:09,514
Is blood thicker than water?

527
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,584
Since the Prime Minister said so

528
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:16,921
That's okay

529
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,158
Then I have to call

530
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:22,360
The Prime Minister is called uncle

531
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,365
My uncle joins forces with my nephew

532
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,634
Isnâ€™t it natural?

533
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,836
Forget about the law of nature

534
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:34,405
uncle

535
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:36,707
what do you want

536
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:41,512
After the prince succeeds to the throne,

537
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:43,648
Keep the position of Prime Minister of our country

538
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:45,316
Also for my sister

539
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:47,385
stay alive

540
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:48,953
If I succeed

541
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:51,322
Daxia Military and Political Affairs

542
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,924
Of course with uncle

543
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,258
Divide and conquer

544
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,193
Don't dare

545
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:57,195
Just keep your wealth

546
00:34:57,361 --> 00:35:00,398
Brother Ning, I value family ties most.

547
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:01,999
never let down

548
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:03,234
Prince Benevolence

549
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:04,669
Great blessing of summer

550
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:05,403
Okay, okay.

551
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:06,504
Let's get down to business.

552
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:07,472
What's serious

553
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:08,906
Yuan Hao is not dead

554
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:10,308
How did he succeed to the throne?

555
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,345
Your Highness, you don't have much time.

556
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,481
There will be divine punishment at this time

557
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:17,715
People's hearts are in turmoil

558
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:18,883
Kill Qingtianzi

559
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:20,918
Only the prince has the chance to win over people's hearts

560
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:21,986
Control Daxia

561
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:25,323
If Qingtianzi is allowed to spend this period,

562
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:26,657
After that

563
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:28,926
Itâ€™s hard to find good opportunities

564
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:29,927
That uncle

565
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,363
Is there a clever plan?

566
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:36,200
In a few days, he will be Qingtianzi

567
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,835
To marry a new queen

568
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:40,104
That's not a girl from the Yi family

569
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:42,507
It was originally the prince's marriage contract

570
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:44,809
If you have something to say, say it

571
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,043
Prince

572
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,479
Is there any chance to meet this girl?

573
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,281
But I only have an engagement with her

574
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:51,349
Not affectionate

575
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,484
How could she help me with the assassination?

576
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:55,319
If the wedding day

577
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,688
Where is the bride changing?

578
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:02,026
Who would dare to assassinate my father?

579
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,596
I am a citizen of Daxia

580
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:06,264
Of course there will be no one

581
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:07,965
Dare to disobey Qing Tianzi

582
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:10,201
But we have friends from the Song Dynasty

583
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:13,237
I remember that Miss Zhao

584
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:14,739
Wisdom and courage

585
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,874
you mean

586
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:18,843
Let Zhao Jian replace the bride

587
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,578
Assassinate Yuan Hao on the wedding day

588
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,313
This is the only way

589
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:23,247
Do you know Zhao Jian

590
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:24,248
Does it have anything to do with me?

591
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:25,049
Love each other

592
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:26,617
Everyone can see this.

593
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,520
But the young hero wants to do great things

594
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:31,022
Then you have to make a choice

595
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,023
You take the benefits

596
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,391
Let's give up the price, right?

597
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:38,029
If I could just pretend to be the bride

598
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:38,529
That's so good

599
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,397
It's not impossible

600
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:40,965
I mean Zhao Jian

601
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:41,999
This matter can be discussed

602
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:43,000
Then hurry up

603
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:44,302
Just these few days

604
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:46,204
If you need medicine, a doctor

605
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:48,039
Just speak up

606
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,447
Wang Kuanâ€™s injury

607
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:58,349
you don't know yet

608
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:04,822
Wang Kuan is injured

609
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:19,804
how's it going

610
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:22,607
Still too hot

611
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:23,541
The danger is still there

612
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:24,408
I'll make some more medicine

613
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,144
who

614
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:40,524
Can it be saved?

615
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,027
Definitely

616
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:14,158
How is Wang Kuan?

617
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:19,397
Let me have a few words with Zhao Jianjian alone.

618
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:20,698
Very clear

619
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:23,234
I looked around to see the situation

620
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:28,873
His arm

621
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,474
Didn't get it back

622
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,577
I'll go tell Brother Ning Ling

623
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:36,047
Ask him to help get his arm back

624
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:36,947
it's useless

625
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,751
As long as we stay here

626
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:43,287
Wang Kuan will definitely survive

627
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:03,808
Qing Tianzi

628
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:07,478
Mr. Wei

629
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,047
I really need to say something to you

630
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:12,416
Why do you have to torture yourself like this?

631
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:14,085
Guilty

632
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,556
I tell you good news

633
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:21,625
Your son was rescued by his friend

634
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,229
He is young and ignorant

635
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:27,665
Mr. Wei

636
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:29,967
Let me ask you something

637
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:32,069
You feel

638
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,673
The so-called divine punishment before Xingqing Mansion

639
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,942
Was it planned by Yuan Zhongxin?

640
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:44,382
There is no god in the world

641
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,119
Letâ€™s not talk about whether there are gods or not.

642
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,087
I am surprised that

643
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:51,789
These things

644
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,625
Yuan Zhongxin can't do it alone

645
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,660
That's in Xingqing Mansion

646
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:59,063
Who is helping him secretly?

647
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:02,566
Han people in Daxia

648
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:03,667
I'm not the only one

649
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:06,470
Yuan Zhongxin's biological father

650
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,938
Also joined the Qing Emperor

651
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:10,474
The bond between father and son

652
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:14,378
Why didn't Prince Qingtian call him to ask?

653
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,183
Yuantian Pass has long disappeared

654
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,285
Xue Ying saw Yuantian Pass on the cliff

655
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,954
He said

656
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:25,790
Yuantianguan is always around

657
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:28,793
Watching us secretly

658
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:32,062
But he never showed up

659
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:33,798
He didn't take any action at the banquet

660
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:38,235
Right

661
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:40,638
If he took action

662
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,339
Wang Kuanâ€™s arm should not be broken

663
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,675
What does his broken arm have to do with me?

664
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:47,745
Yuantianguan is hidden

665
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:50,114
What about the Yuan clan?

666
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:51,682
They are all

667
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:53,984
He doesn't want his people anymore.

668
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,354
Where is this person Yuan Tianguan?

669
00:40:58,088 --> 00:40:59,924
Maybe you don't care about anything

670
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:02,059
Father and son

671
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:04,528
After all, they are father and son

672
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:07,665
He cares about his son

673
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:11,068
Actually I don't care about you either

674
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:14,538
I only care about my bloodline

675
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,240
remain in this world

676
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:18,008
You could have saved Wang Kuan

677
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:18,676
Can

678
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,979
To be honest, I still thought about it

679
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:24,682
Finally let it go

680
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:30,621
You donâ€™t always talk about yourself

681
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:32,857
No personality at all?

682
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:35,459
This shows that our father and son

683
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:37,161
In the same vein

684
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,430
Makes sense

685
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:42,132
So it seems

686
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:44,735
These actions of Xingqing Mansion

687
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:47,438
It was done with the help of Yuan Tianguan

688
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,139
pretty close

689
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:52,776
Ashamed

690
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:54,578
Ashamed Ashamed

691
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:56,213
before me

692
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:58,082
Have you ever doubted Mr. Wei?

693
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,718
It is also inevitable

694
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,422
That seems to be the biggest trouble now

695
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:07,091
Itâ€™s Yuantian Pass

696
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:24,775
Yuantian Pass disappeared

697
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:26,343
It's hard to find

698
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:29,980
I'm talking about the Yuan clan.

699
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,448
All arrested

700
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:34,585
Do you want him to throw himself into a trap?

701
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:37,454
a bit difficult

702
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:40,424
But I have to try anyway

703
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:43,327
Mr. Wei

704
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:44,695
Tomorrow

705
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,730
I need to work harder for you

706
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:49,199
What does Qingtianzi want me to do?

707
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:53,203
Mr. Wei is a great talent

708
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,573
You just said something

709
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:57,541
Very well said

710
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:00,578
Father and son

711
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:03,847
After all, they are father and son.

712
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:19,356
Brother Wang, you are awake.

713
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,139
I was rescued by you
