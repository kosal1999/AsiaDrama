1
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:49,576
father

2
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,024
Walk

3
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,996
Chase them all and kill Yuan Hao.

4
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:21,341
All go

5
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:31,184
can not go

6
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:33,319
I want revenge

7
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,854
Chasing Yuan Hao is impossible

8
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:35,722
I'm not afraid

9
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:37,123
Then your father died in vain.

10
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:46,866
Answer me a question first

11
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,202
Why are these cavalry

12
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,136
Coming so slowly

13
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:51,738
And there are so few people here

14
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,276
The deputy general in the camp said

15
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,277
There is no military order from my father

16
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:58,545
You can't leave the camp casually

17
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:00,113
I only adjusted the personal guards

18
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,681
The mobilization of troops and horses is too slow

19
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,949
I'm really too late

20
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:05,952
the person who said this

21
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:06,986
Definitely bought

22
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:12,659
you listen to me

23
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:14,394
Yuanhao is nearby

24
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:15,428
There must be soldiers and horses

25
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:16,162
if we catch up

26
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:17,063
It's just to die

27
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:18,731
what we have to do now

28
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:19,799
Just race against time

29
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:20,433
Back to the military camp

30
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:23,336
if you have no choice

31
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:23,836
To take over

32
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:24,871
The location of the Yuzhou Military Supervision Department

33
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:26,539
Your father's revenge

34
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:29,175
Maybe there will be no chance to apply again.

35
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,783
We all want to avenge your father

36
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:03,443
father

37
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:33,706
father

38
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:37,477
Among the people of Xixia

39
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:38,578
When building momentum for the goat god

40
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,380
Always dressed like this

41
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,582
who wears these

42
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:43,950
Who is the messenger of the sheep god?

43
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:46,185
when the time is right

44
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,454
You can also use this image of the sheep god to show people

45
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,155
Recreate the miracle

46
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,298
I raise cranes

47
00:04:58,865 --> 00:04:59,866
I usually use this crane whistle

48
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:00,667
call them

49
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:02,902
There are these cranes

50
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:03,870
It's easier to bluff people

51
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,171
What are you doing with this?

52
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,340
When in Xingqing Mansion

53
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:09,375
Chu Niao met Wei Zhuoran

54
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:09,976
I know

55
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:11,511
Wei Zhuoran in Xixia

56
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,280
Wei Zhuoran had met Chu Niao before

57
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,383
Meet in Xingqing Mansion

58
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,319
Chu Niao’s identity was not revealed

59
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:20,620
There are two possibilities

60
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:22,722
one

61
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:24,657
Wei Zhuoran misses old love

62
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,092
one more

63
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,028
Wei Zhuoran joins Xixia

64
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,130
Have other plans

65
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:32,932
You didn't test it

66
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,701
At that time in Xingqing Mansion

67
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:35,535
Yuan Hao keeps a close eye on

68
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,103
I dare not act rashly

69
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,440
Now Yuan Hao has come to Helan Mountain

70
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:41,908
Xingqing Mansion is empty

71
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:43,476
You rush there immediately

72
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:44,777
Want to kill Yuan Hao

73
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,779
You should explore Wei Zhuoran’s tone of voice

74
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:48,414
is it necessary

75
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:49,782
Seeing Liang Gewei

76
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,017
So he led his troops to kill him.

77
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:53,820
Yuan Hao will not die so easily

78
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,256
Do you want to count on Wei Zhuoran?

79
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,392
But what if he really

80
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,393
Took refuge in Xixia

81
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:02,428
Now the life and death of Yanei are unknown

82
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,063
Just say it

83
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:06,499
Yanei was harmed by Yuan Hao

84
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:09,635
No matter whether it is true or false

85
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:11,337
Son is dead

86
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:13,539
There is always revenge

87
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,778
You want to use your office to force the palace?

88
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:20,813
adapt to changing circumstances

89
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:22,782
how about you

90
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:24,584
This consecration ceremony

91
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:26,386
Originally, I was just making a start.

92
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:27,620
these three years

93
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:28,955
How to fake gods

94
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:30,556
Various technical details

95
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:32,091
Actually it's all you

96
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,192
Ask Xue Ying to deliver it to me

97
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,961
It should be said that this is a plan to enshrine the gods.

98
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:37,563
If it weren't for your Qizhai's help,

99
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:39,732
There will be no results today

100
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,467
should

101
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:43,603
We are creating gods in Tanzhou

102
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:44,771
Also inspired by you

103
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:46,272
Moreover

104
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,174
Same as Secret Pavilion

105
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:49,542
We should have been helping each other

106
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:50,977
What's more, we are

107
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:51,778
same goal

108
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:53,346
So the matter of deification

109
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,081
You continue to take over

110
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:56,816
you are not with us

111
00:06:58,618 --> 00:06:59,352
not going

112
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:00,620
what are you going to do

113
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:01,654
unimportant

114
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:02,321
No

115
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,189
Very important

116
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:04,657
tell me the answer

117
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:08,961
I'll go back to the camp at the foot of the mountain

118
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,464
Confirm the whereabouts of Chu Niao and Ya Nei

119
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:12,632
hear me out

120
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:16,269
Chu Niao and Yanei

121
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,036
Nine out of ten

122
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,704
Falling into Yuan Hao's hands

123
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,474
if they are still alive

124
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:22,775
Even if you all go

125
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:24,277
I don’t have the strength to save people either.

126
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,379
Why are you going back?

127
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,549
I am calmer and more ruthless

128
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,118
If both of them were still alive

129
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,120
You must be unable to help but save people

130
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:36,255
It is very likely then

131
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:37,423
It's a total annihilation

132
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:39,892
You don't save people

133
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:43,563
I am a smart person

134
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,832
Smart people are always ruthless

135
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:46,599
Only look at the pros and cons

136
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:50,703
How many of you

137
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,772
I am an old acquaintance with Brother Ning Ling

138
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,907
The Youzhou Army only recognizes you.

139
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,576
so you

140
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:58,110
More important than me

141
00:07:58,578 --> 00:07:59,479
No room for error

142
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,113
The situation is urgent

143
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:02,548
No time for this

144
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,016
A noisy game

145
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:04,951
Changes have occurred

146
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:06,786
When moving forward

147
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:08,354
Don’t be indecisive

148
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:29,175
Try the crane whistle

149
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:41,821
coming

150
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:53,799
If there is Chu Niao

151
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,800
News from inside the office

152
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:56,636
Please send message as soon as possible

153
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,337
certainly

154
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,307
Take care

155
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:05,945
Going Down the Mountain

156
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:51,824
It's obviously a bird

157
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:54,627
Why do you still recognize people?

158
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:16,282
If Liang Gewei didn't

159
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,149
Control Yuan Hao

160
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,551
The situation becomes difficult to handle

161
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,020
but we all know

162
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:22,555
This business won't go well

163
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:24,490
It doesn't matter

164
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:25,791
As long as we are still here

165
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,293
This battle is not lost

166
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:28,694
certainly

167
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,002
I know you are all worried

168
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,437
Are Yanei and Chu Niao okay?

169
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:41,507
I also want to rush there

170
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,242
Meet Yuan Zhongxin and Xue Ying

171
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:45,011
Look at the Yuzhou Army

172
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,145
Have you rushed to the rescue?

173
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:48,881
But we don't have time

174
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:50,983
We must race against time

175
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,118
Rush to Xingqing Mansion

176
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,053
Wen Wuqi is right

177
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:56,222
Yuan Hao is here

178
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:57,890
Xingqing Mansion is empty

179
00:10:58,424 --> 00:10:59,225
your decision is right

180
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,227
But this means

181
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,730
I left Yanei here

182
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,134
You just need to remember

183
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,603
This decision was made by me

184
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:12,638
if done wrong

185
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,674
It has nothing to do with you

186
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:23,416
I think

187
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,520
Wen Wuqi is not what he said

188
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:29,755
He is a ruthless person

189
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:41,834
Set off

190
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,269
Go to Xingqing Mansion

191
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:34,854
I killed Liang Gewei

192
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,425
Father is brave

193
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:43,863
Youzhou Army

194
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,898
There are generals who are loyal to me

195
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,666
Liang Gewei's death

196
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,503
within today

197
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:51,771
Youzhou Military Supervision Department

198
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,239
can be used by me

199
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:55,441
congratulations

200
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,109
My father’s magical power is unparalleled

201
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,677
Worthy of being called the Son of Heaven

202
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,681
Why doesn't the queen speak?

203
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:04,383
I'm waiting

204
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,051
A woman

205
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:07,920
Such a big thing

206
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:08,988
Don't quite understand

207
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:19,732
There is an injury on the back

208
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,834
Please Queen, please bandage me

209
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,402
yes

210
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:57,436
It looks like the camp is not big

211
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:00,239
Don't dare to move the army

212
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:03,709
My dad

213
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,865
My dad said

214
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,301
If all the troops are transferred from their bases,

215
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:33,672
A war is inevitable

216
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:50,956
The one who led the troops this time

217
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,958
There are only two lieutenants

218
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:56,395
When we mobilized our troops just now

219
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,663
Who is unwilling to cooperate?

220
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,632
Neither of them want to

221
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,668
The worst thing that could happen now is

222
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:04,136
I'm afraid these two

223
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:05,471
They have all surrendered to Yuan Hao

224
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:08,274
Now what

225
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,110
With just the strength we have now

226
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,746
I'm afraid it's impossible to charge directly into the formation.

227
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,429
How about we leave here first?

228
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,264
Rush back to the Youzhou Army Headquarters

229
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:33,699
no

230
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,334
One step slow, one step slow

231
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,072
Are you brave?

232
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:41,540
Shaodu unified the army

233
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:42,841
speak directly

234
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:45,210
I guess they should now

235
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:45,911
Waiting for you to return to camp

236
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:46,812
Find an opportunity to take action

237
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:50,816
It should be so

238
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,053
Then we'll deliver it to your door

239
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:58,390
Xiao Xue’s knife is very fast now.

240
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:15,941
newspaper

241
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:18,711
The Shaodu troops have returned to camp.

242
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,113
Hurry up and ask the young commander to lead the army.

243
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:21,780
yes

244
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:26,318
this

245
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:26,785
Wait

246
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:28,954
Try to make the crime of patricide and seizing power

247
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:30,656
Put it on Liang Maixiang

248
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,423
Then what

249
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:33,625
Captured alive or

250
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:34,593
Liang family control

251
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:35,961
Youzhou has been in charge of military affairs for many years

252
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:37,963
if she lives

253
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:39,832
There will be endless troubles

254
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,107
this

255
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:03,655
this

256
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,290
Du Tongjun

257
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:06,792
How could the Dutong Army be like this?

258
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,861
Dad was murdered

259
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:11,397
Also invite two generals

260
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,899
Make the decision for the Liang family

261
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,840
How did he die?

262
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,275
Shaodu unified the army

263
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:24,743
Please tell me more details

264
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:51,537
Brother Ning Ling

265
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:54,173
Son and minister are here

266
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,707
I'm waiting for your explanation

267
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,011
What does the father want to ask?

268
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,881
Two commanders of the left wing army

269
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:03,816
How did he die?

270
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:05,050
Liang Gewei

271
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:06,618
why here

272
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:07,586
besides

273
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:08,954
Sheep Guardian

274
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:09,955
Let's explain together

275
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:11,757
Return to Father

276
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:13,559
Liang Gewei's rebellion

277
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,694
Liang Gewei

278
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,463
He is an accomplice with the Sheep God Envoy

279
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,298
This person is very ambitious

280
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,133
He actually killed his guardian mother

281
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,267
two commanders

282
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:23,402
and

283
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:24,837
Also force my son

284
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,905
Turn against his father

285
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:27,739
Sons and ministers disobey

286
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,875
Liang Gewei actually had murderous intentions

287
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,345
The sheep guardian also plots rebellion

288
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:35,414
You can know a person's face but not his heart

289
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:39,518
these three years

290
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,987
The Goat God really helped me a lot

291
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,056
But recently I discovered

292
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:45,824
Something's wrong with the situation

293
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:47,759
Within Daxia

294
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,362
Worship God more than me

295
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:51,830
This is wrong

296
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:53,298
indeed

297
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:54,500
so you say

298
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,634
When killing the sheep guardian angel

299
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,635
I didn't stop you

300
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,803
I think you can make it happen

301
00:18:58,871 --> 00:18:59,438
Father

302
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,273
Where do these words come from?

303
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:02,741
I never thought about it

304
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:03,909
To kill the sheep guardian angel

305
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,111
Treason

306
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:07,813
Queen Mother

307
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,315
The Sheep Keeper is involved in many things

308
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,050
How can you let your father

309
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,185
Do it yourself

310
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,387
Say you killed

311
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:16,655
Just admit it and it's over

312
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:18,690
Could it be

313
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,826
You don’t listen to my father’s words either

314
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:23,362
I understand

315
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,632
I won't let him come yet

316
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:27,900
bear this charge

317
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,035
The Blue Emperor is Merciful

318
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:31,436
Fine

319
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,340
Let’s not talk about this first

320
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:37,142
Kill the sheep guardian angel

321
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:38,410
you say

322
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,078
The commander was killed by Liang Gewei

323
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,513
It's for rebellion

324
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:43,382
He still wants to kill you

325
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,751
Sons and ministers are loyal and courageous

326
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:47,352
Then why are you not dead?

327
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,522
My father is like a god descending from the sky

328
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,257
Liang Gewei fled in panic

329
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:53,659
The fate of sons, ministers and mother

330
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:54,693
It was my father who saved me.

331
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:57,062
That's it

332
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:58,797
It's all Liang Gewei's fault

333
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,601
The sons and ministers never discovered the treacherous plot

334
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:04,703
Also punished

335
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,539
Anyway, Liang Gewei is dead

336
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:09,241
Whatever you say is fine

337
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:10,242
Father

338
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,377
What your son said is absolutely true

339
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,178
Every sentence is true

340
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,414
Lift up

341
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,668
Spreading the will of the Goat God

342
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,036
It turned out to be a Song Dynasty

343
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:39,871
What's going on?

344
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:41,873
perhaps

345
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,277
It’s Liang Gewei, the thief

346
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,112
United with the Song Dynasty

347
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:50,983
Is it Liang Gewei's fault?

348
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:55,120
There are such vicious people in the world

349
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,191
I trust you

350
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:00,759
all conspiracies

351
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,027
All from Liang Gewei

352
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:05,130
Father Wang Shengming

353
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,599
After I came back, I asked the camp

354
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,534
After the two commanders died

355
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:10,736
It is true that you have never left the camp.

356
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:12,371
sons and ministers

357
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:14,306
Trapped by thieves

358
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:17,109
but there is one person

359
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,778
Have been preparing the army

360
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,513
Buy military morale

361
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,122
Explain it

362
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:33,892
I deserve to die

363
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:46,772
Shaodu unified the army

364
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:47,673
what happened

365
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:48,907
Everyone

366
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,376
These two unite with foreign enemies

367
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:52,711
Framing Du Tongjun

368
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:56,581
Now the traitor has been beheaded

369
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,018
the rest of you

370
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:01,720
not guilty

371
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,587
At this time

372
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:04,656
Don’t make the mistake of yourself

373
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:14,800
Foreign enemies covet

374
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:16,835
My father was murdered

375
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:19,938
I am the Yuzhou Army

376
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,973
There should be a concerted effort

377
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:23,475
Overcoming difficulties together

378
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:26,144
Everyone

379
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:29,548
The Liang family will never betray anyone

380
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:32,551
The Youzhou Army belongs to the Liang family

381
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,720
Also yours

382
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:45,297
Willing to lead the army for the young capital

383
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,064
Serve

384
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,403
Willing to serve the Shaodu Army

385
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,239
Willing to serve the Shaodu Army

386
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,575
Willing to serve the Shaodu Army

387
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,443
Willing to serve the Shaodu Army

388
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:01,880
Willing to serve the Shaodu Army

389
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,455
Let the whole army set off

390
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:12,257
Return to camp

391
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:13,291
yes

392
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:23,301
I'm still thinking about it at this time

393
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:24,469
Two more words

394
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:27,372
Is it because Xiaoxue’s knife is not fast enough?

395
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:33,578
Thanks

396
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,216
Do you really want to go back to camp?

397
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:41,019
How about rushing to kill Yuan Hao now?

398
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:43,355
What happened to the palace?

399
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:45,424
I checked the tent many times

400
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,591
There's no way we can hide that many people

401
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,359
Imperial villa

402
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,560
He is from the palace

403
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,694
They sent people and horses here

404
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:50,829
That seems to have been planned.

405
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,531
Yuan Hao in Helan Mountain

406
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:53,598
A separate courtyard built at the east foot of the mountain

407
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,201
A place for daily pleasure

408
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:58,904
It shouldn't be far from here then

409
00:23:59,137 --> 00:23:59,838
That's right

410
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:00,939
If you want to say that

411
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:02,674
The so-called dozens of people

412
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:04,342
I'm afraid it's just bait

413
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:06,211
Yuan Hao should have an army

414
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:07,078
Still leaving the palace

415
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:08,747
Kill it now

416
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:09,748
Ten deaths without life

417
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,183
If there is an ambush outside the palace

418
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:13,819
Then why didn't he directly

419
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:14,753
Take action on us

420
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:17,155
Your father has commanded the Youzhou Army for many years

421
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:19,057
If troops and horses are used

422
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:19,891
Youzhou army must rebel

423
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:21,660
best countermeasures

424
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:23,795
Just kill your father

425
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:25,997
Then use two deputy generals to seize power

426
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:27,899
what should i do now

427
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:29,301
You are now running as fast as you can

428
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:31,203
Rush back to the Youzhou Army Camp

429
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,505
As long as the Youzhou Army is still in your hands

430
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:35,240
You have a chance to take revenge

431
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,141
good

432
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:38,643
Wait until I take control of the military

433
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:40,779
Then he raised an army to kill Yuan Hao

434
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:41,513
no

435
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:43,615
Why not?

436
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:44,783
Those who raise an army must die

437
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:46,751
You can't beat Yuan Hao

438
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:48,587
As long as you don't raise troops

439
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:49,521
We can still maintain a stalemate

440
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:51,189
Yuan Hao at this time

441
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:52,257
Nor do we hope that in Xixia

442
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:52,891
There will be war again

443
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:54,493
I can't hold out much longer.

444
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,093
Wait for the opportunity

445
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:58,263
Believe me

446
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,233
I want to kill Yuan Hao more than you do

447
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:03,835
I wait

448
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:06,137
Wish you a safe journey

449
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:08,240
You have to leave

450
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,741
Xiao Xue stayed

451
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:10,642
I

452
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,010
You go back with Shao Du to lead the army.

453
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:14,079
I'm afraid Yuan Hao is in the Youzhou Army

454
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:15,080
Still have a backup plan

455
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,982
In case there is a critical moment

456
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:18,083
Remember to use the knife

457
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:19,818
Waiting for your news

458
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:29,694
Aren't you worried about him?

459
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:30,795
Worry

460
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,898
In Xixia territory

461
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:34,299
each time

462
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:36,334
Maybe it’s goodbye forever

463
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,737
Then why don't you leave with him?

464
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,039
act in desperate situation

465
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,440
We can only move forward courageously

466
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,276
what i want to do now

467
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:45,477
Just to protect you

468
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:47,279
Help you take over the Yuzhou Army

469
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:52,784
Our Liang family hates Yuan Hao

470
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:54,719
It's because I'm desperate

471
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:56,555
what about you

472
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,090
Why do you have to kill him?

473
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:02,661
Because people who have been hurt by war

474
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:04,462
out on a limb

475
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,399
Don't kneel down in a hurry yet

476
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,099
explain explain

477
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:10,302
minister

478
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:14,439
momentarily confused

479
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,474
Became bribed by Liang Gewei

480
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,276
make big mistake

481
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:19,878
hereby

482
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:22,013
Apologize to Qingtianzi

483
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:25,183
Betrayal of Father

484
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:26,618
Relying on Liang Gewei

485
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:27,786
It's you

486
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:30,455
That's right

487
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:33,959
Killed two commanders

488
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:35,260
also me

489
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:37,495
Recognized pretty quickly

490
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:40,665
at this point

491
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:43,068
Nothing to hide

492
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,136
Brother Ning Ling

493
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,237
you two

494
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:47,339
We have a good relationship, right?

495
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:50,075
Father

496
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:52,744
did not expect

497
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:55,714
He has deceived his son for so many years

498
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,218
Seizing power in the military

499
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:01,419
Imprisonment of the Prince

500
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,954
What is this crime?

501
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:04,155
capital offense

502
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:06,224
When to cut

503
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:10,562
what you think

504
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,397
Indeed a capital crime

505
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,699
They should be escorted back to Xingqing Mansion

506
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:16,201
Convicted by the Trial Division

507
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:17,836
No need to bother

508
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:18,837
Someone coming

509
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:24,376
Rice poultry north

510
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:25,710
Tied to the ordering platform

511
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:27,345
Tomorrow morning

512
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:28,279
Beheading in the camp

513
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:30,081
yes

514
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:49,868
Father

515
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:54,939
Don't be so anxious

516
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,542
Why is this so anxious?

517
00:27:58,243 --> 00:27:59,377
And I want to let you

518
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:00,712
Kill him with your own hands

519
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,148
Our father-son love is deep

520
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:04,315
He lied to you

521
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:06,117
I can't see it

522
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:07,552
How about it

523
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,120
I will give you a hand

524
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,954
chance for revenge

525
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:11,990
My son is so touched

526
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:18,930
Come

527
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:20,231
Hang this one up too

528
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:43,855
Step aside

529
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:52,731
Young people of the same race

530
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:53,865
Don't know the importance

531
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,667
Make Qingtianzi laugh

532
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:58,837
Quite loyal

533
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,039
What is your name

534
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,342
Noriyoshi

535
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:07,746
What are you carrying?

536
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:09,080
open me and see

537
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,121
The king has an order not to be violated

538
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:35,106
You take it with you

539
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,341
What are these things for?

540
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:37,842
I am young

541
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:38,710
Feel more

542
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,118
I know you are loyal and brave

543
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:49,020
But Qing Tianzi

544
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:50,922
To our wild family

545
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,157
I've never been very reassured

546
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:54,025
sometimes

547
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:55,827
You have to know how to bow your head

548
00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:58,229
clear

549
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:02,634
Such a loyal person

550
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:07,372
Now there are fewer

551
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:47,078
I don't know Brother Yuan.

552
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:47,812
With Xue Ying

553
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:48,346
how's it going

554
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:50,915
They can definitely catch up

555
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:52,417
But no one told him

556
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:53,418
Let’s go to Xingqing Mansion

557
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,020
Looking for a turning point

558
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,722
Xingqingfu is the only place to go

559
00:30:57,722 --> 00:30:58,423
He can think of

560
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:01,025
That's good

561
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:04,028
What are you looking for?

562
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,631
my herbs

563
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:07,866
What's wrong with you?

564
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,637
This is both medicine and poison

565
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,939
Used separately, they can cure diseases and save lives.

566
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,875
If mixed in proportion

567
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:18,343
Drug effects are mutually exclusive

568
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:19,711
That's extremely poisonous

569
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:21,546
Because taking the wrong medicine is

570
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,614
Taboos in practicing medicine

571
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:23,882
On the contrary, I remember it very clearly

572
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:25,950
I think

573
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:29,721
No matter how brave Yuan Hao is, he is invincible

574
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:31,522
After all, we are humans too

575
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:34,626
Makes sense

576
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:37,629
if we could get close

577
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:38,630
People around Yuan Hao

578
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,497
There is a chance of poisoning

579
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,533
Ning Lingge and Queen Yeli

580
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:44,936
The mother and son and Yuan Hao

581
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:45,837
Be wary of each other

582
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:47,138
Be more careful than your enemies

583
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:47,639
too difficult

584
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:52,744
Isn’t there someone beside Yuan Hao?

585
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,912
My new favorite concubine?

586
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:54,946
If I could find her way

587
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:55,747
Enough

588
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:56,347
Harder

589
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:58,149
None of us know her

590
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:58,983
not to mention

591
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:00,218
People may not be willing to help us

592
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:06,991
Is it Brother Yuan?

593
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:13,731
Xixia people

594
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,470
Where did the soldiers and horses come from?

595
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:25,076
Brother Yuan Haoning

596
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:25,944
Or the Youzhou Army?

597
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,792
Should I use my identity as a divine envoy to pass the test?

598
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:51,903
Can't leave

599
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:27,872
Zhao Jian

600
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:39,984
Zhao Jian

601
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,050
The troops are divided into two groups

602
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:47,385
Chase up the mountain

603
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:48,252
yes

604
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:16,180
Brother Ning Ling

605
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:17,915
You feel

606
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,318
Those people pretending to be angels

607
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:21,819
Where are you now?

608
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,255
Run away

609
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:26,991
if they were just for

610
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:28,392
Scam some money

611
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:30,962
Then you should run away now

612
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:32,497
Can't find it

613
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:34,265
possible

614
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:35,800
But if they were

615
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,201
Liang Gewei's subordinates

616
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:39,937
Then follow the Youzhou Army

617
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:43,341
That makes sense.

618
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:44,909
There is another possibility

619
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:48,179
These people are here for me

620
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:50,548
Then now they will

621
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:51,749
There's only one place to go

622
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:53,818
Xingqingfu

623
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:56,020
I'm not in Xingqing Mansion

624
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,388
The identity of the messenger

625
00:35:57,388 --> 00:35:58,589
Can deceive many people

626
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,226
I'm on the way to Xingqing Mansion

627
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:03,761
Dispatched the cavalry

628
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,531
Do you think I will gain anything?

629
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:09,834
Return to Father

630
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:11,202
sons and ministers

631
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:12,436
have no idea

632
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:20,678
Don't run

633
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:33,791
Ran up the mountain

634
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:34,358
Chase

635
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:35,493
Keep up

636
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,069
fine

637
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:46,837
step by step

638
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:50,908
Go and kill Mi Qin Mu Bei for me.

639
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,417
Is there a problem

640
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:16,193
Why rebel?

641
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,634
Born to be a rebel

642
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:31,709
Is there anything else you would like to say finally?

643
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:36,347
I failed

644
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:40,951
But there will definitely be people who come after you

645
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,855
i want to tell them

646
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,426
Yuan Hao is not scary

647
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:50,594
He is also a human being

648
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,135
How crazy!

649
00:38:58,602 --> 00:38:59,470
kill someone

650
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,172
No need to talk so much

651
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,109
After all, he has military exploits

652
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:06,143
Leave a whole body

653
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:11,749
Take action

654
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:31,629
Father's Mercy

655
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:33,431
Touching heaven and earth

656
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:35,032
okay

657
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:36,434
Give me back the knife

658
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:52,216
good

659
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:58,022
Hang up his body too

660
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:00,991
I want everyone to know

661
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:03,027
people who are my enemies

662
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,195
What's the end?

663
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:31,822
quick

664
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:37,461
Over there

665
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:49,139
Chase

666
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:49,673
quick

667
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,010
Walk

668
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:53,944
quick

669
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:54,311
quick

670
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:06,757
kill him

671
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:24,508
Where are the people?

672
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:30,714
four people

673
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:32,082
yes

674
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:33,250
Three of them were wearing

675
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,251
Sheep Guardian Dress Up

676
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:35,185
died on the carriage

677
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,253
How did you die?

678
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,221
Killed by a sharp blade

679
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:37,988
who killed

680
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:38,989
perhaps

681
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:39,990
It's internal strife

682
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:42,693
Then there is another one

683
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,761
Escape on horseback

684
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:44,828
Cavalry intercepts

685
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:45,696
In the end, the man was desperate

686
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:46,697
Jump off the glacier

687
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:49,333
There's just no body

688
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,467
Didn't catch it

689
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,476
Congratulations, Your Majesty

690
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:00,377
Kill all the angels

691
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:01,812
too late

692
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:05,082
Now those who believe in the goat god

693
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,150
I don't know how many

694
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:08,118
Or neglected

695
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:09,954
Just thinking

696
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,822
The benefits of God’s blessing

697
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,658
Ignore the harm he brings

698
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:17,428
Most of our people believe in ghosts and gods

699
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:19,263
There is no way

700
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,599
It’s because I believe too much in ghosts and gods

701
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,700
That gives people a headache

702
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:24,702
If they don’t believe in ghosts and gods

703
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,671
How can I respect you as the Son of Heaven?

704
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:29,440
Don't say it

705
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,708
Recalling God

706
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:31,775
People who do this

707
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,177
Really smart

708
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:35,946
It's a pity that not a single person was left alive.

709
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:38,749
spread out

710
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:40,751
Just say Liang Gewei

711
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:41,986
To kill the angel

712
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:43,354
That's why I killed him

713
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:44,788
Yes, sir.

714
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:45,856
Of course

715
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:47,758
Kill the Angel

716
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:49,593
How can you be the Qing Emperor?

717
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:51,829
Tomorrow's camp

718
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,230
You mother and son

719
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,698
Come with me to the Rikyu Palace.

720
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:56,834
Stay for two days to enjoy the mountain view

721
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:58,235
That's great

722
00:43:58,869 --> 00:43:59,737
this child

723
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,171
Always hope

724
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:02,539
I am being filial under your knees

725
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,742
This time I got my wish

726
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,744
It's good to be filial

727
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:08,545
Just don't try your best

728
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:09,713
Become a send-off
