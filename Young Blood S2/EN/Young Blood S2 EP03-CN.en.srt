1
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:58,651
Do you know me yet?

2
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:00,253
I must know you then

3
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:00,887
You Bazhai

4
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,021
There is no time limit for the deputy director’s article.

5
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,291
Mi Ge Shi Zhai

6
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:06,559
You are the only one who has eight fasts and no fasting chief

7
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:07,827
two deputy chiefs

8
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:08,761
Still not dealing with each other

9
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:10,230
It's famous

10
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,604
It turns out that you are pretending to be a ghost.

11
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:18,738
You still here

12
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:19,939
I am very pleased

13
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:20,573
What

14
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,108
There was a bet in Secret Pavilion back then

15
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:23,977
Everyone in Gambling Secret Pavilion

16
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:25,745
Who will take the first step

17
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:27,347
Yanei

18
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,249
You are at the top

19
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,085
See you persist till today

20
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,987
I feel a little happy

21
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,322
What does it mean to take the first step?

22
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:37,690
Do not misunderstand

23
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,325
Don't bet on life or death

24
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:40,827
indeed

25
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:42,929
Who will be kicked out of the Secret Pavilion first?

26
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,097
That's not a good thing either.

27
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:46,799
etc.

28
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:47,500
I do not know how

29
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,401
Is there such a bet?

30
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,171
no one told you

31
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,173
You guys worked together to hide it from us Qizhai

32
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,107
This bet

33
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,575
But your family Yuan Zhongxin did it

34
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:56,309
he

35
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:57,410
The village where he sits

36
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,012
He also bet that I would be removed first

37
00:02:59,012 --> 00:02:59,646
No

38
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,614
he bets on himself

39
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:06,486
I said

40
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,121
He was so noisy at that time

41
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,523
good guy

42
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:12,058
This guy is too weird

43
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,960
This kind of bet is possible

44
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:15,695
Quiet

45
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:18,097
sit

46
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:23,770
Are you training me like a dog?

47
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,139
Don't make any noise

48
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,507
You've had enough

49
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,142
Don't be angry, Yanei

50
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,144
Mr. Wen has been training birds recently

51
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:32,245
He didn't mean it.

52
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,649
He tamed those cranes

53
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,117
is not that right

54
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:39,252
why

55
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,621
The God of Sheep has the ability to herd cranes

56
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,256
Cranes accompanying them

57
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,491
It was daytime just now

58
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,527
everyone saw it

59
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:49,862
Or maybe it was domesticated from childhood

60
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:53,099
Crane is a noble bird

61
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,367
How dare you raise

62
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,003
The crane is a noble bird in Xixia

63
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,239
There is a saying

64
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,039
Have you heard of it?

65
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,341
Emperor of the World

66
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,309
Thousands of blackheads are lucky

67
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,578
on land

68
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:07,580
Wan Chi has different opinions

69
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:10,016
Can't understand

70
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,684
This is a Xixia proverb

71
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:13,886
Black heads in the world and red faces on the ground

72
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:14,854
Where are the blackheads?

73
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,422
Refers to the Xixia party aristocrats

74
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:17,957
The red face is the ordinary people

75
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,026
And blackhead also means white crane.

76
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:20,860
party nobility

77
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,262
Considers himself a descendant of White Crane

78
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:23,496
To them

79
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,698
Cranes are regarded as noble birds by gods

80
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:29,369
Why is the crane called Blackhead?

81
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,004
Just the top of the head

82
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:32,138
red

83
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:33,740
Isn’t that Hedinghong?

84
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,241
A bit dark brown

85
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,643
So the crane herder

86
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,380
Only God

87
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,015
But what is red face?

88
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,483
Refers to macaque

89
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,584
You all know this

90
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:46,085
We are in Xixia

91
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,186
Been here for a long time.

92
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,288
Read a lot of books again

93
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,057
I also read a lot of books

94
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:51,958
I do not know how

95
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:53,493
Yanei

96
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:55,561
Think it over before you speak

97
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:57,897
Okay I'm sorry

98
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:00,133
I can't read

99
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,701
I have a strange disease

100
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:02,535
I get a headache when I read

101
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:06,339
what

102
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:08,641
sit

103
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:15,948
People cannot be tamed

104
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:16,649
Wenwuqi

105
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,184
Get rid of the gas, get rid of the gas

106
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:18,618
Wen Shao

107
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:19,986
You should also restrain yourself.

108
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,360
Just by this sheep head

109
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,362
and tame cranes

110
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,496
You can pretend to be a god

111
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:31,998
There are two more preparations

112
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:33,866
The Appearance of the Goat God

113
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,370
should be accompanied by two visions

114
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:39,772
First, the gods of Helan Mountain are spiritual

115
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,175
Cliff Light

116
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:43,543
I did see the light on the cliff.

117
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,526
It's pretty.

118
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,229
What's the principle?

119
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,164
What is the principle

120
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:17,844
look

121
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:19,545
mica

122
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,880
Mica in bright light

123
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,215
Can stimulate light

124
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,249
That light just now

125
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:24,250
Just because of this

126
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:26,119
Someone is on the cliff

127
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,387
Inlaid with this stone

128
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:29,689
What about the second vision?

129
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,424
resurrection of the dead

130
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:32,892
It's me

131
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,896
I lay on the women's shed to load the body

132
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:37,830
It was preparation

133
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,564
Resurrection in public

134
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,332
For everyone to see

135
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:41,334
did not expect

136
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,735
Met you in Yanei

137
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,170
Cliff Light

138
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:45,705
It's embedded with mica

139
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:46,305
yes

140
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:48,775
You can see it

141
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:53,413
Where did you find all that mica?

142
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,547
Hard to find

143
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:55,982
Not from this mountain yet

144
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,283
It has to be shipped all the way here

145
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,087
It’s not convenient for horses to climb up this mountain.

146
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,423
carried up

147
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:06,159
How heavy is this?

148
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:09,929
The footprints are pretty deep

149
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,698
Looks like the same person

150
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,167
do you remember

151
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,535
Are we Bazhai Laotang?

152
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:16,202
Remember

153
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,372
The one who is strong enough to carry a stone mill

154
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:23,743
He was the one who carried it

155
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,011
Then embedded it

156
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,245
It's really impossible without him

157
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,382
Then you Bazhai

158
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:30,483
Everyone comes to Helan Mountain

159
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:31,617
Just the three of us

160
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,518
The other three are not here

161
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:34,921
Then you pretend to be the goat god

162
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:35,521
Any functions

163
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:36,989
The tasks we took on

164
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,524
It’s to kill Yuan Hao

165
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,293
But this has nothing to do with gods

166
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,060
What does it matter?

167
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,962
The gods appear during sacrifices

168
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,766
Explain that the Sheep God bestows blessings on Yuan Hao

169
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,935
No one is afraid of him now

170
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,903
In fact, this may not be a good thing

171
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,038
Backed by gods

172
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:53,139
Why is it bad

173
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,140
given by gods

174
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:55,908
Naturally, you can also take it back

175
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,143
You know the party members

176
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,044
Where does it come from?

177
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,379
Guqiang

178
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,149
I seem to have heard of the ancient Qiang people

179
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,518
The ancient Qiang people performed sacrifices by wearing sheepskin

180
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:06,886
Wearing sheep bones

181
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,988
Why do Xixia gods have sheep heads and human bodies?

182
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,023
This is also the source

183
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,158
Wen Shao discovered

184
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,126
Although the ancient Qiang clan has long since disappeared,

185
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:15,461
But check carefully

186
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:16,762
In fact, many ethnic groups now

187
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:17,830
All originated from ancient Qiang

188
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:18,898
Coming from the same lineage

189
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:20,867
yes

190
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,401
Maybe in tens of millions of years

191
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,569
people will find out

192
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,204
all different races

193
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,206
In the end, they all come from the same origin

194
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,609
All different wars

195
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,010
Until that day

196
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:32,778
Maybe they will all disappear

197
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,213
because of different languages

198
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:35,481
different customs

199
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,650
Return to one at last

200
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:40,286
Destiny is born together

201
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:42,488
But this is different from eradicating Yuan Hao

202
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:43,289
what is the relationship

203
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,758
The Dangxiang clan believes in gods

204
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:48,961
Yuan Hao is the king of Xixia

205
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:50,696
Claim to be a vulgar

206
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,398
That is Qing Tianzi

207
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,468
Ordinary slander or even power struggle

208
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,703
Can't even touch his foundation

209
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,437
yes

210
00:08:59,138 --> 00:08:59,939
What to do?

211
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:03,142
Unless the gods are angry

212
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:04,410
Take away the title of Wuzu

213
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,248
Xixia fears gods

214
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,417
Then start from the most fundamental point

215
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,286
Destroy Yuan Hao's foundation

216
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,021
Millions of soldiers

217
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,289
Machiavellian

218
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,925
Nothing can withstand the wrath of gods

219
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,460
Guardian God Ascension

220
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,162
It seems like a blessing

221
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,898
In fact, we have to wait until the time is right

222
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:27,934
Using superstition

223
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,169
Let all Yuan Hao rebel against their relatives and leave their relatives

224
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,240
this is my plan

225
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:37,843
Conferred God

226
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:13,079
alright

227
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,681
Let’s not talk about God for now.

228
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:16,616
Let’s talk about people

229
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,018
How are you doing now?

230
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,519
It's really hard for me

231
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,455
Speaking of which, we can be considered allies.

232
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:24,890
Especially Miss Zhao

233
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:26,759
You and I are even more in love with each other

234
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,227
Logically speaking, I should really let you go.

235
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:29,228
Get out of here

236
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:30,730
You're confused when you sleep

237
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,334
If I let you go

238
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:36,969
I can't explain it.

239
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:38,404
I won’t let you go

240
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,706
You can confess me later

241
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,407
also affects

242
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:42,842
The relationship between my father and son

243
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,310
Actually, there are other ways

244
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:45,645
Please enlighten me

245
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,445
kill us

246
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,547
There is no way to interrogate a person after he is dead.

247
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:49,682
You'll be safe

248
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:50,883
You are not afraid of death

249
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:51,684
afraid

250
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:54,687
But do you dare to kill me?

251
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,024
Yuan Hao asked you to interrogate us

252
00:10:58,424 --> 00:10:59,759
It's obvious that this is a test

253
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,228
If you kill us

254
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,163
Wouldn't it be a guilty conscience?

255
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:06,799
actually

256
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,135
There's only one thing I don't understand

257
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,306
Why doesn't my father kill you?

258
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,574
According to his character

259
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,376
It's impossible to leave anyone alive.

260
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:20,279
What did he say to you on stage?

261
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,247
Does it have anything to do with you?

262
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,549
Headache

263
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:28,020
What to do with you?

264
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,990
What should I do?

265
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:34,160
Father

266
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:44,403
what's the topic

267
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:46,138
Return to Father

268
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,009
Asking who is the mastermind behind the scenes

269
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:55,548
Do you even need to ask?

270
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,017
I guessed it all

271
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:15,735
Sons and ministers are dull

272
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:17,403
Unknown

273
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,005
Who did the father guess?

274
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,446
Not Song Dynasty

275
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:28,881
They are Liao people

276
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,421
It can’t be one of my own

277
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,655
Want to kill me

278
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:38,958
What do you say?

279
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,963
What my father said is absolutely true

280
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:46,265
You guys go down

281
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,067
I want to talk to them alone

282
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,043
Father

283
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:00,045
around you

284
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:01,847
Leave no guard

285
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:04,784
No need

286
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:10,990
yes

287
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:38,083
How could he be willing

288
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,685
Stay alone with Song people

289
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,588
What about Lu Nanshan?

290
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:44,890
Can't find it

291
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,026
He must be hiding something

292
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,229
Now it seems that this assassination

293
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,298
Unpredictable intentions

294
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,400
Lu Nanshan comes to Helan Mountain

295
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:55,734
Came to find you

296
00:13:59,038 --> 00:13:59,705
Right

297
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,207
When the cliff shines with light

298
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:02,174
He also chased after her

299
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,044
Then won't you see him?

300
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:07,780
Master Wen said

301
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,348
He only trusts the president.

302
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:11,684
Lu Zhangyuan passed away

303
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,520
Lu Nanshan now takes over as the new head of the academy

304
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,688
For me

305
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,089
There is only one branch

306
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,225
Do you think there is something wrong with Lu Nanshan?

307
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,526
Your assassination this time

308
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:21,961
did he ever tell you

309
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:22,895
Yuan Hao's strength

310
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,531
That means he didn't think about it

311
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:26,465
you will succeed

312
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:27,933
Then why did he

313
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,001
Will they arrange this assassination?

314
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:29,768
have no idea

315
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,103
you can ask him

316
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,807
Chu Niao

317
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:35,808
Send him down the mountain

318
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:37,776
Lu Nanshan should be looking for him

319
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:38,978
good

320
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:42,882
What about you?

321
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,050
Our mission is not finished yet

322
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,218
What should Xiao Xue and the others do?

323
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,386
Just ask Lu Nanshan

324
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,221
He should make his own arrangements

325
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,322
What if he doesn't save people?

326
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,260
If this is true

327
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:56,695
I will take action when the time comes

328
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:10,809
Wenwuqi

329
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:13,445
Lu Nanshan said

330
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,014
Sanzhai's entire army was annihilated

331
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:19,018
You should also be careful

332
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:26,692
Everyone is mortal

333
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,501
Let's go Yanei

334
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,468
I'll take you down the mountain

335
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,699
Does Brother Ning Ling want to kill me?

336
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:11,770
yes

337
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:14,740
Whoever you say is who

338
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,308
We help with certification

339
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,010
Just let us go then

340
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:20,946
Want to go

341
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:21,947
Yes Yes Yes

342
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:23,382
Search for a solution

343
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,250
I really want to kill you

344
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,286
You can't get off the altar

345
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,721
honestly

346
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:30,823
Do you want us to help you?

347
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,124
Identify Brother Ning Ling

348
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,292
We can get things done

349
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,963
You and your brother are really different

350
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:46,238
when you are during the day

351
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:47,439
Mentioned Yuan Da Ge

352
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:48,774
What's the meaning

353
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:01,987
Yanei

354
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,288
What's wrong

355
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,590
Ask you something

356
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,290
you say

357
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,026
your dad

358
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:08,260
Have you got engaged?

359
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:10,229
Why are you asking?

360
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,230
Just ask

361
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:13,165
deal

362
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,001
Whose family is it?

363
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,170
The daughter of a household minister

364
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:21,774
Deputy Envoy of the Three Departments

365
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:23,742
A wealthy family

366
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,611
Is it done?

367
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,347
The marriage was called off

368
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:29,615
Why

369
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:31,683
You knew me at that time

370
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,619
The first of the four great dandies in Beijing

371
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:34,286
bad reputation

372
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:36,722
That is not bad

373
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:40,292
What do you mean by okay?

374
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,328
Do you think I'm okay?

375
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,500
The Battle of Qichuan Village

376
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,202
Only your brother is left behind

377
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:51,403
Why

378
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:54,206
Because you want to use him

379
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,508
There were so many generals in the Song Dynasty

380
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:59,044
Why did you choose him?

381
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:00,245
Speak directly if you have anything to say

382
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,656
Can they listen to these things?

383
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,357
They all know about me

384
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:14,693
good

385
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,814
Come and sit

386
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:37,049
Have a drink with me

387
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,254
Let's go

388
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,624
what is he going to say

389
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,025
Let's just go on

390
00:18:58,504 --> 00:18:59,972
Pretty little girl

391
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:02,908
Come and sit

392
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:27,332
how do you

393
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:28,367
not talking

394
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,204
Why do you suddenly ask that?

395
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:33,739
Of course it's to express your feelings

396
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:36,975
Don't play tricks on me

397
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,044
why do you think so

398
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:43,949
Do you think I am capable?

399
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:45,684
Not really

400
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:51,223
Could it be

401
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,125
Just because I'm handsome

402
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,928
Actually

403
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,229
Quite cute

404
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,765
Neither capable nor handsome

405
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,133
Where did the intention come from?

406
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,467
Because you are honest

407
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,302
What

408
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:04,503
honest

409
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,138
I

410
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,840
The first of the four great dandies in Beijing

411
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:10,309
honest

412
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,978
It can't be considered honest.

413
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,013
How do I put it?

414
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,015
Can see clearly

415
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,184
What does it mean to be able to see clearly?

416
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:20,986
All over the Quanmi Pavilion

417
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,087
Can be seen clearly

418
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:23,388
It’s just you, Yanei

419
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,990
what are you thinking

420
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,558
Almost everything can be seen through at a glance

421
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,960
Just looking at it makes you feel at ease

422
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:29,161
no

423
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:30,429
what do i think

424
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:31,430
You seem to be cursing someone

425
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:33,365
And your family’s educational background

426
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:34,299
I'm envious

427
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:35,867
How can I have a homeschool?

428
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:37,135
Your family is rich

429
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,005
The house was raided

430
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,039
do not you know

431
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,641
I know

432
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,977
But your talent for making money is still there

433
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,011
future

434
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,646
It will definitely be no problem to settle down and start a business

435
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,615
Hire some maids then

436
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,650
Cleaning and cooking at home

437
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,985
Leave it all to them

438
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,386
Then eat every day when you are hungry

439
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:55,220
Go to sleep when you feel sleepy

440
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,455
Don't worry about anything

441
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,225
How beautiful such a day must be

442
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:04,363
Looking around the Secret Pavilion

443
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,664
Can do

444
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:06,732
It’s just you, Yanei

445
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:08,934
Just like you

446
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:10,702
Why are you still in the Secret Pavilion?

447
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:12,070
I was sold here

448
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:13,972
The family suffered a disaster

449
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:15,040
A family fleeing

450
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:16,908
Lost on the road

451
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,977
Almost robbed by bandits

452
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:20,012
Then what

453
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:21,613
Then he was rescued by the commander

454
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:22,848
Lu Zhangyuan

455
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:24,883
Didn't you find your family members?

456
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:26,685
found

457
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,187
when found

458
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:30,689
Everyone is gone

459
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,425
I see you are in the Secret Pavilion

460
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,027
Laughing all day

461
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,629
Seems quite happy

462
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:39,498
Yes, what's wrong?

463
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:40,699
did not expect

464
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,168
Have you ever encountered such a tragedy?

465
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,341
Everyone in the family is gone

466
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,443
I have to live happily for them

467
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:55,247
My dad

468
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,016
My mother

469
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:00,285
two sisters

470
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:02,120
a younger brother

471
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:09,761
I have to live up to the laughter of five people

472
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:12,064
It's even

473
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:27,979
Then you follow the leader

474
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:28,980
Back to Kaifeng

475
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,616
Later, the head of the court took charge of the secret pavilion.

476
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:32,651
I joined

477
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:34,119
But you said

478
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:36,288
You were sold into the Secret Pavilion

479
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,290
I sold it myself

480
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,926
The abbot saved my life

481
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:42,627
I can't forget this kindness

482
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:44,963
So I entered the Secret Pavilion

483
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,869
I just want to do more things

484
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,838
Pay off the debt to the Master

485
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:57,008
Lu Zhangyuan is dead

486
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:58,744
You don't have to pay anything back

487
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:00,679
That won't work.

488
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,181
what do i owe

489
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:04,783
Remember in my heart

490
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,453
Then how long do you want to pay?

491
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,488
Soon

492
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,623
Wait till Yuan Hao dies

493
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:12,657
It's almost paid off

494
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,292
then go

495
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:15,527
Go live my little life

496
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,463
I quite like what you said too

497
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:20,265
I have to work harder

498
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,167
Wait till I get my dad

499
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:23,268
Picked up from Lingnan

500
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:25,137
I can get through it

501
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,104
The day I want

502
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:29,775
Waiting for you and me

503
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:31,410
Get everything done

504
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,044
Think again

505
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:34,413
Do you want to spend time together?

506
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:37,983
I will consider it carefully

507
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:38,784
this answer

508
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:02,941
Below is the Youzhou Army Camp.

509
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,877
They are now teaming up with Lu Nanshan

510
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:06,845
I won’t embarrass you

511
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:09,981
how about you

512
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:12,984
Young Master Wen doesn’t trust Lu Nanshan

513
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,586
We Bazhai do things

514
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:15,821
He doesn't care.

515
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:16,988
I won’t see him anymore

516
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,424
your business

517
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:20,158
I won't tell him

518
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,798
We must meet again

519
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:30,735
Everyone has to live well

520
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,571
of course

521
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:37,175
That

522
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:39,277
I am leaving

523
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,481
I see you go

524
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:30,862
who

525
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,869
Do you know who I am

526
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:41,540
be honest

527
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:43,341
tap tap tap

528
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:48,980
Xiaolu Zhangyuan

529
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:06,164
where do you come from

530
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:08,066
I

531
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,335
I ran all the way down the mountain

532
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,973
Daytime assassination, no sign of you

533
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:17,208
I thought you had an accident

534
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,277
I'm timid

535
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:20,478
Escaped to the mountain

536
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:22,614
Who did you meet?

537
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:25,350
no one

538
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:26,785
I hide myself

539
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:31,990
What should Yuan Zhongxin and the others do?

540
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:33,491
You don't care about them anymore

541
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:36,761
You saw the daytime assassination, too.

542
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,330
Yuan Hao didn't kill him

543
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,497
what do you want to say

544
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:40,732
Yuan Zhongxin

545
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,336
Maybe he has already joined Xixia

546
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,104
You fart

547
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,143
Do you want another drink?

548
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:53,411
Let's talk business first

549
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:54,379
Good

550
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:57,048
Then I'll say it straight

551
00:26:58,183 --> 00:26:59,618
The Battle of Qichuan Village

552
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,786
Only your brother is left

553
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,388
It was predetermined.

554
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:06,057
Must be your brother

555
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:07,158
other people

556
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,493
Leave no one behind

557
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:11,029
Why

558
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,166
After all, the love between father and son is deep.

559
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:18,903
What's the meaning

560
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:23,341
your dad

561
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:25,710
Serving under my command

562
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,413
You don’t know yet

563
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:31,650
Yuan family surrenders to Xixia

564
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,051
do you have evidence

565
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,086
After Yuan Bo's fin incident

566
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:36,488
Jingxi East Road

567
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,056
Yingtianfu Yuan clan

568
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,090
overnight

569
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,291
disappear

570
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:41,459
No trace

571
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:43,528
People are missing

572
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,163
Why did you say you came to Xixia?

573
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:46,598
My guess

574
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:47,666
Guess

575
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:49,768
Can this kind of thing be guessed at?

576
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:51,936
Yuan Hao's surname is Yuan

577
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,172
Yuan Zhongxin also has the surname Yuan

578
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:57,108
Isn't it a coincidence?

579
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:58,777
are you crazy

580
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:00,278
What does this mean?

581
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:03,448
Your surname is Lu

582
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:05,183
That Lu Gui is also named Lu

583
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:06,685
Are you a family?

584
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:08,586
do you know

585
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:11,690
Yuan Hao's original surname was Tuoba

586
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:14,926
Now this Yuanzi

587
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:16,327
where does it come from

588
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:18,697
How would I know

589
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,134
Tuoba clan of Northern Wei

590
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:25,970
I changed my last name to Yuan

591
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,339
Just to tell the world

592
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,774
My Big Summer

593
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:32,544
It is the Tuoba inheritance of the Northern Wei Dynasty

594
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,878
Noble blood

595
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,481
Have the ambition to conquer the world

596
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:38,216
Put gold on your face

597
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,985
Little girl, don't talk nonsense

598
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:43,288
This inheritance is no lie

599
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:45,490
Yuan Zhongxin

600
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:49,294
Your clan is the Tuoba inheritance

601
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:52,731
Now understand

602
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:55,100
Why did your father surrender to me?

603
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,068
You are not a Song

604
00:28:57,469 --> 00:29:01,139
You and we are of the same origin

605
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,041
All are inherited from Xianbei

606
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:04,809
One spirit and one branch

607
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:07,378
That

608
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:08,446
Even if it is Yuan family

609
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:09,647
It is the inheritance of Tuoba lineage

610
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,649
It doesn't necessarily mean that they will surrender to Xixia.

611
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:13,985
So the assassination is the test

612
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:15,487
Yuan Hao will not kill Yuan Zhongxin

613
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,122
It proves that I guessed it right

614
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,089
so what

615
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:20,525
It shows that Yuan Zhongxin can no longer be trusted

616
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:21,926
Family name and bloodline are so important

617
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,328
Of course it's important

618
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,664
This is for people

619
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:28,700
The foundation

620
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,606
I originally wanted your father to persuade you

621
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:36,040
But unfortunately

622
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,575
He is not in Daxia

623
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,377
If he is not in Xixia, where is he?

624
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:41,613
He has his own things to do.

625
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:42,680
do what

626
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:44,149
test

627
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,084
What do you say about your father?

628
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:47,719
Even if it's him

629
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:50,088
Lead the entire Yuan clan to join me

630
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,489
I still can't

631
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:53,057
Trust him completely

632
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:54,959
Give him a job

633
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,895
Let him prove himself

634
00:29:58,530 --> 00:29:59,998
So you don't kill me because of him

635
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:00,999
That's right

636
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,269
Then do you think I will surrender?

637
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:06,738
You and I are of the same race.

638
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,039
Why did you come to lower the word?

639
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,175
Does my brother know about this?

640
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:13,144
After Qichuan Village

641
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,779
Your father wrote him a letter

642
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:15,980
Told the truth

643
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:19,517
Advise him to serve Xixia wholeheartedly

644
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:21,653
but he refused

645
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,588
I also do not understand

646
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:25,190
why did he refuse

647
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:28,259
Because he is a fool

648
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,895
I kind of know now

649
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:33,765
Why did he want to die?

650
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:36,534
own biological father

651
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,536
Let him betray the Song Dynasty

652
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,339
How desperate this must be

653
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,210
If it weren't for revenge for my colleagues

654
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:47,545
presumably

655
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:48,746
He doesn't necessarily

656
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:49,948
Can I last until then?

657
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:52,917
But even so

658
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:54,018
He still protects me

659
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,055
Didn't tell me those secrets

660
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:01,492
Going to a dead end alone

661
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,128
Actually he

662
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:05,897
There's no need to do this

663
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,765
You won't understand at all

664
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:09,934
Even if my brother knew

665
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:11,402
I am of Xianbei bloodline

666
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,938
He will still not hesitate

667
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:15,139
Choose to be loyal to the Song Dynasty

668
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:17,642
that kind of loyalty

669
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,777
It's engraved in his bones

670
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:21,045
That's right

671
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:28,620
Born in Song Dynasty

672
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:30,455
Growing up in the Song Dynasty

673
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:31,589
Song people

674
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:40,665
Achieve a person

675
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:41,766
It's the path he took

676
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,601
It's not his blood.

677
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:47,372
why are you laughing

678
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:49,707
I am telling the truth

679
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:51,910
Our Song Dynasty is a big country

680
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:53,945
vast territory

681
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:54,946
All ethnic groups have

682
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,081
That's not what I'm laughing at

683
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,518
Little girl, you have to think clearly

684
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:01,586
you

685
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:03,922
Can accept him

686
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:05,690
What about other Song people?

687
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:10,361
I am a Song

688
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,932
Don't even listen to your father's words

689
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:15,700
I only have my brother

690
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:18,536
I thought that with your temperament

691
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:20,371
Can you pretend to surrender?

692
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:21,372
Fake is fake

693
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:23,541
But you have to believe it.

694
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:25,843
That's true.

695
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:29,380
That

696
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,214
What do you want me to do

697
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:31,783
What to do with you three?

698
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:46,764
people

699
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:49,167
In times of drastic changes

700
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,169
what is the most important

701
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,340
choice

702
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:58,242
I'll give you one more night to think about it

703
00:32:58,576 --> 00:32:59,744
Will you kill me again tomorrow?

704
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:01,145
won't kill you

705
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,614
I have to take you back to Xingqing Mansion

706
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:05,216
Give your dad a surprise

707
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,252
If you don't serve me tomorrow

708
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:09,854
I killed both of them

709
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:13,491
That really scared me

710
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:20,999
Otherwise, lower it.

711
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,403
There must be some benefit, right?

712
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:27,338
Otherwise, I will treat you like this

713
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,239
The location of Qing Tianzi

714
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:29,207
Let me sit

715
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:33,811
sure, no problem

716
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:35,880
The premise is

717
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,982
You have to kill me

718
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:52,630
etc.

719
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:57,502
What's wrong

720
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,538
Yuan Family surrenders to Yuan Hao

721
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,572
Let’s not talk about whether this is true or not.

722
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,174
What to do with Zhao Jian and Xue Ying?

723
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:05,910
After all, Zhao Jian is of royal blood

724
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:07,845
She won't be complicit

725
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,280
But they were both caught too

726
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:11,349
I thought Yuan Zhongxin

727
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,683
Will take into account old feelings

728
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:13,851
did not expect

729
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:15,987
He is so cruel

730
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:18,189
It was you who planned the assassination

731
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,558
He can keep you from having to interfere

732
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,559
nonsense

733
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:23,895
If Yuan Zhongxin didn't know

734
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:24,695
What about the Yuan family?

735
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,964
What if you wronged him?

736
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:28,933
The result is the same

737
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:30,535
What do you mean the result is the same?

738
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:33,571
I say it again

739
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,607
Yuan Zhongxin is eighty-nine out of ten

740
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,376
Will serve Xixia

741
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:43,181
What about Zhao Jian and Xue Ying?

742
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:47,185
Zhao Jian is the princess

743
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,454
Even if it's just a branch

744
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:51,289
She is royalty after all

745
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:52,256
do not worry

746
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:53,891
This hatred

747
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:57,028
I, Da Song, will never forget

748
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:58,729
No one is dead yet

749
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:08,005
Yuan Hao

750
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:10,575
Zhao Jian will never be spared his life

751
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:12,577
The ending is decided

752
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:16,380
Waiting to return to the capital

753
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,149
I will ask for it personally

754
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:19,383
Begging the officials

755
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:21,619
Send troops for revenge

756
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:25,523
war again

757
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:26,958
What's wrong

758
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:30,294
You don’t want to avenge Zhao Jian?

759
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:32,130
You can save them now

760
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:33,464
How to save

761
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,702
Yuan Hao's camp is not far away

762
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,971
Be strong and tenacious

763
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,808
Tell me how to save

764
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:55,019
Don't take it

765
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:56,721
Then I took it

766
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,860
I'll ask you again tomorrow

767
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:15,406
Father

768
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,141
The people were locked up in the tents

769
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:18,009
yes

770
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:19,210
I will personally guard it

771
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:20,778
No need for you

772
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:22,980
Hold the camp

773
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:23,848
yes

774
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,400
It seems that the Song people did not betray us

775
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,068
But they are still alive

776
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:45,970
There's always a contingency for this kind of thing

777
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:47,705
Then we still have to silence them

778
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,841
Is there anyone available in the camp?

779
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:54,212
have

780
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,279
There are a few more in the camp

781
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:56,647
Brothers who grew up together

782
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:57,848
Comparable to brothers

783
00:36:58,182 --> 00:36:59,417
Then call them over

784
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:00,818
yes

785
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:17,702
it's useless

786
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:19,971
We are in the enemy's military camp

787
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:21,772
Even with a weapon in hand

788
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:22,773
Can't get out either

789
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:23,941
What should I do?

790
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:53,571
coming

791
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:56,741
Don't you want to take action?

792
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:24,735
Keep silent

793
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,105
They are all allies, so what are they talking about?

794
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:29,707
I can't silence my mouth, right?

795
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:32,343
Even if you can catch me by surprise

796
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:33,444
Kill the guard at the door

797
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:35,012
The three of us are not dumb

798
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:36,047
Really take action

799
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:37,014
we shout loudly

800
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:38,282
None of you can escape

801
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:41,118
Why does Miss Zhao have to be so transparent?

802
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:43,087
Since there is no way to silence

803
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:43,721
Afraid of us again

804
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:45,222
Shake you out

805
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,123
How to do it

806
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:48,225
It's better to save people

807
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:49,760
No trial

808
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,262
There is no mastermind anymore

809
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:53,698
In fact, there are emotional factors involved.

810
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:56,467
I really want to explain

811
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:58,502
But the timing is wrong

812
00:38:59,170 --> 00:38:59,904
or

813
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:03,607
I'll send you out first

814
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:06,043
there

815
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:30,401
Everyone

816
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:32,403
I hope you don't forget

817
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:35,139
Our cooperation is not over yet

818
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:36,507
Yuan Hao is not dead

819
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:38,008
This matter is not over yet

820
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:40,478
I thank you on behalf of my father

821
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:46,083
Miss Zhao

822
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:48,219
do not forget me

823
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:56,227
Really let them go

824
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:13,844
fine

825
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:15,579
There aren't many of them

826
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,547
we have a chance

827
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,028
haven't seen you for a long time

828
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:05,563
uncle

829
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:09,066
Aren’t you in Lingnan?

830
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,135
Escaped long ago

831
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:13,637
You have joined Yuanhao

832
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:15,339
Could it be

833
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:17,575
Let me be trapped in Lingnan for the rest of my life

834
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,618
But you are not using yourself as bait

835
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:29,587
Achieve the strategy of car and gun

836
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:30,588
Are you plotting against Xixia?

837
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:32,022
people like you

838
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:33,390
How could he serve Yuan Hao?

839
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:35,292
Counterfeit cars and guns

840
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:38,896
do you really think

841
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:39,763
Used several times

842
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:41,332
Damaged car and gun

843
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,100
It can really shake the morale of Daxia’s army

844
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,902
You can really deceive Yuan Hao

845
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,137
But your cruel plan at that time

846
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:48,172
We are all watching

847
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:49,940
Car and gun strategy

848
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:51,909
what is the end result

849
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:53,444
Yuan Hao's siege failed

850
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:54,478
Retreat

851
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:55,813
At that time, Daxia

852
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:57,815
Already at the end of the crossbow

853
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,483
Car and artillery

854
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:01,886
Just a reasonable excuse to retreat

855
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:02,620
actually

856
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,488
The result of this bitter plan is very simple

857
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:06,490
One of them, I was laid off

858
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:09,126
Many positions are vacant in the Imperial Guard

859
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,561
one more

860
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:11,929
My house was raided

861
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:14,565
All the money goes into the treasury

862
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:16,133
Up and down

863
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:17,568
From king to minister

864
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:19,069
All good

865
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:20,571
The Wei family was targeted

866
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:21,572
if not

867
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:22,239
Uncle, you

868
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:23,707
Why did you agree then?

869
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:25,142
that time

870
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,478
Wei Yuan has entered the Secret Pavilion

871
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:28,779
I disagree

872
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,214
What should he do

873
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,749
So the yamen went to the Secret Pavilion

874
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:32,883
To threaten you

875
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:34,685
Make a so-called bitter meat plan

876
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:36,320
At least save your life

877
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,689
Wei Yuan can also stay in Kaifeng

878
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,024
As for me, last

879
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:41,225
You can also give him one

880
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,459
A stalwart figure

881
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,695
Why not?

882
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:47,164
Yuan Hao heard about this

883
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:49,733
Personally send people to Lingnan

884
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,502
Save me here

885
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,003
I

886
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:56,040
Just got a chance to be reborn

887
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,208
So you really surrendered to Xixia

888
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,176
Song Dynasty

889
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:00,644
gave me such a result

890
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,947
What would you choose instead?

891
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,018
If Yanei knew

892
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:10,487
It should be quite sad

893
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:11,589
my business

894
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:13,057
Don't tell him

895
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,358
Just let him think

896
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:18,562
He also has an amazing father, right?

897
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:28,505
here

898
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:30,941
I thank you too

899
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:35,679
Always taking care of Wei Yuan

900
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:36,847
uncle

901
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:38,382
How about you come with us?

902
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:39,617
Let's go back to Song Dynasty together

903
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:41,619
It's all reached this point

904
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,187
Where is the chance?

905
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:43,854
It can be said that it is you

906
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:45,422
Saved us back

907
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:46,590
There is always a turning point

908
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:47,658
Thank you for your kindness

909
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:50,027
only

910
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,762
The prince passed away

911
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,430
Only rely on the princess

912
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:55,332
I'm afraid you can't save me

913
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:57,001
You know about my dad.

914
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:58,669
Of course I heard about it

915
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:00,571
Condolences to the princess

916
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:03,374
you two

917
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,776
Take care of yourself

918
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:09,847
What's the meaning

919
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:12,383
nothing

920
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,320
Leave the horse to you

921
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:18,222
Go with peace of mind

922
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:21,959
never come back
