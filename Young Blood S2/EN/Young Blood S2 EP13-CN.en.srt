1
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:04,190
Mr. Yuan

2
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,161
Yuchi is here too

3
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:10,230
How did he

4
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,965
Will find it near here

5
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,666
He is your subordinate.

6
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:14,167
or

7
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:16,069
Ask yourself

8
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,369
Are you there?

9
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,545
Afraid that I'll run away

10
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:01,648
I'm all tied up here

11
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,349
It's hurt like this and you're afraid that I'll run away

12
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:05,919
I swear on my character

13
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:06,986
I will never run, okay?

14
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,522
Don't give me any trust

15
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:43,990
Mr. Yuan

16
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:45,725
Only you

17
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:48,194
Who else

18
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,231
How did you find this place?

19
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,040
gentlemen

20
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,610
I was supposed to be in Kaifeng

21
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,445
but guess what

22
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:07,880
Lu Nanshan wants to kill Yuan Zhongxin

23
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,849
Thanks to me for responding in time

24
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:10,883
rescued people

25
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,385
Take it all the way to Tanzhou

26
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,455
This road is full of mountains and rivers

27
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:15,989
Cross mountains and ridges

28
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,290
Didn't ask you this

29
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,294
What do you want to ask, sir?

30
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:23,696
How did you find this place?

31
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,567
No trace of Mr. is found in the post house

32
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,269
I was at a loss

33
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:31,004
But think about Mr.

34
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,171
Aren’t there Xixia people?

35
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,906
Xixia people don’t understand food

36
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:34,841
Eat meat all day

37
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:36,109
This side of Jinghu South Road

38
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,277
Not in the mood for roasting

39
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:40,113
But I look at this mountain

40
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,481
There is smoke rising

41
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,216
touch near

42
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,083
in ashes

43
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,718
You can also smell some meat

44
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,054
Follow this path and touch it down

45
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,056
I found out that my husband was living in seclusion here.

46
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,562
Not too stupid.

47
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:57,830
gentlemen

48
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,133
Don't make fun of my intelligence

49
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,034
If it weren't for me

50
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,669
Yuan Zhongxin died in Kaifeng

51
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,172
This way

52
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,007
Dining in the open air, trekking through mountains and rivers

53
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:09,809
Tired of traveling over mountains and ridges

54
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,078
Why send Yuan Zhongxin to Tanzhou?

55
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,681
Of course it’s for Mr.

56
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:15,882
Father and son reunited

57
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:19,686
Wormwood

58
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:22,455
gentlemen

59
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,390
I use my wits

60
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,591
Rescue people

61
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:28,027
I just don't know

62
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:29,696
Where have people gone now?

63
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:32,999
gentlemen

64
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,668
What about the Xixia people around you?

65
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:37,403
died

66
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,272
died

67
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,009
Killed by the Dragon God

68
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:45,411
what

69
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:46,612
At once

70
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:49,949
Village near the post house

71
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:51,284
A statue of a dragon with a severed head

72
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:55,555
i know that

73
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:57,290
gentlemen

74
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,992
It was you who cut off the dragon head

75
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,428
not me

76
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,201
It wasn't Mr. who cut it off

77
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:10,436
What are you doing

78
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,306
It wasn't Mr. who cut it off

79
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:14,640
That'll be fine

80
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,009
What does it mean to be okay?

81
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:18,344
Then Dragon God won’t

82
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:19,412
Blame it on Mr.

83
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:23,316
gentlemen

84
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,084
Then you know

85
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:26,652
Where is the dragon head now?

86
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:27,954
Isn't it in the village?

87
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,188
It's not that the head is missing

88
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:30,323
If it’s gone, it’ll be gone.

89
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,391
gentlemen

90
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:32,892
How about we get the faucet back?

91
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,327
What are you looking for?

92
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:36,329
gentlemen

93
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,632
Do you want to live forever?

94
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,002
Immortality

95
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:46,873
Have you ever been hit in the head?

96
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:49,642
No

97
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,210
Mr.

98
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,311
Do you know who cut off the dragon head?

99
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:53,746
You're done with Longtou

100
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,449
Sir, do you know?

101
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,884
If you know, just tell me

102
00:06:58,551 --> 00:06:59,285
gentlemen

103
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,954
Made by the students of North River Star

104
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,156
River Star

105
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:04,390
Beihexing in recent years

106
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,425
On Jinghu South Road

107
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:06,292
Always with these

108
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:07,760
Disasters and disasters are implicated

109
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,394
result

110
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:09,896
Those Xixia people are afraid of ghosts and gods

111
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,731
I also found some disasters to worship

112
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,366
It made the place full of smoke and smoke

113
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,634
Later I traced

114
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,636
Beihe star may be in Yuelu Academy

115
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:17,770
I just chased you here.

116
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,438
gentlemen

117
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,705
Will the faucet be there?

118
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,073
In the hands of North River Star

119
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:22,275
have no idea

120
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:23,176
Mr.

121
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,044
Are you here to check?

122
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:26,078
The Fall of the Northern Star

123
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:27,947
Not easy to check

124
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:29,749
Tanzhou

125
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,150
From official office to garrison

126
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,185
Take out wealthy villagers

127
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,186
They're all catching him.

128
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,520
No results either

129
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:36,956
why

130
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,825
I also want to know

131
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,094
What on earth did he do?

132
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,065
Causing anger and resentment

133
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:59,011
Sir, this place is a paradise.

134
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,546
It's not a place for humans to live.

135
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,521
Yuan Zhongxin

136
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,146
How come it hurts like this?

137
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:12,952
coming

138
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,288
who hurt you

139
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,189
Don't panic

140
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,958
I'll take revenge for you

141
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,294
I chopped him alive

142
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:24,163
Go ahead

143
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:26,399
I move my hand

144
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,403
why

145
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:36,876
gentlemen

146
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,312
I've met people from Qizhai

147
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,065
They said they found the star Pollux

148
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,200
He also said he wanted to use it

149
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,568
Beihexing will replace you with someone

150
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:05,037
Who should I change?

151
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,208
Qizhai asked you to send a message

152
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,311
gentlemen

153
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,046
I think there's something fishy about this

154
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,216
You said that Polaris has excellent hidden potential

155
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,517
How are they

156
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:19,752
So easy to find

157
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:22,755
When to replace

158
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:24,123
Today

159
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:26,125
gentlemen

160
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,361
Maybe it's fake

161
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:29,395
unimportant

162
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:32,665
This deal is negotiable

163
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:01,360
Lu Zhangyuan

164
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,397
Something big is about to happen. Let's keep up.

165
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:04,997
etc.

166
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:06,999
Where are the rest of Qizhai?

167
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,535
There is no difference in where they live

168
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:11,504
Where is Zhao Jian?

169
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,172
It's the same

170
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,107
Wang Kuan's side

171
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,509
Please, Mr. He County Cheng, please follow me.

172
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,344
I'll go to Zhao Jian's place to have a look

173
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:24,483
this

174
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:26,519
The whereabouts of Yuantian Pass

175
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,687
Right before your eyes

176
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,587
This is Lu Zhangyuan

177
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:30,389
Why sacrifice the near for the far?

178
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:31,357
yes

179
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:33,993
baffling

180
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,002
Follow secretly later

181
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,104
Missing the other party’s whereabouts

182
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,807
Don't show your body

183
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:49,375
adult

184
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,277
Let me add two more words

185
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:56,882
After seeing Yuantian Pass

186
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,884
Don't be too harsh

187
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,286
Disabled at most

188
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:01,353
Unfatal

189
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,388
yes

190
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:08,627
Set off

191
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:17,870
Dean

192
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,805
Why don’t we go capture Yuantian Pass?

193
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:22,875
yuantianguan

194
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,145
Must be with Yuan Zhongxin

195
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:28,614
That should be

196
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,751
Related to Yuan Zhongxin

197
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,154
Why didn't Zhao Jian show up?

198
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:48,467
Won't you follow?

199
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,605
Just to deceive others

200
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,507
Your sister and these two guys

201
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:55,775
insignificant

202
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,410
Does Wang Kuan have any county magistrate following him?

203
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:00,746
The only thing Qizhai wants to keep an eye on

204
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,281
Zhao Jian is the only one

205
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:11,290
This Zhao Jian

206
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,526
He is as smart as Yuan Zhongxin

207
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:15,761
Where does this road lead?

208
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,196
This is

209
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:18,798
The mountain gate leading to the back stream

210
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:20,599
Keep up

211
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,318
Fan Chi asked

212
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:40,519
Confucius said

213
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:41,787
Serve the people

214
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,656
Respect ghosts and gods and stay away from them

215
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,090
It can be said that I know it

216
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:46,225
Ask Ren

217
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:47,092
say

218
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,328
A benevolent person first encounters difficulties and then gains

219
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:50,830
It can be said to be benevolent

220
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,079
Let's just say she's smart.

221
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,284
Fortunately, the hospital responded quickly

222
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,453
Want to get out of my control

223
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:15,521
Easier said than done

224
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,922
It's the master's clever plan

225
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,226
If we really go to see Yuantianguan

226
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,628
I'm afraid it won't work just with you and me.

227
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,367
We have to go to Guiyuan Camp to mobilize troops.

228
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,236
Then the Commander-in-Chief will mobilize troops.

229
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,237
I'm going to keep an eye on Zhao Jian

230
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:36,909
I'm afraid you can't keep an eye on it.

231
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:41,280
You go and mobilize troops

232
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:42,681
I'll keep an eye on it

233
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:44,283
yes

234
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,151
Then I'll go back soon.

235
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:47,586
How to find a director

236
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,624
follow it

237
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:52,892
Remember

238
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:54,760
No registration allowed after leaving camp

239
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,628
Don't use ordnance

240
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,296
Pay attention to hidden traces

241
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,864
To prevent Yuan Tianguan from noticing

242
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,934
Don't worry, sir.

243
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:03,269
i know what to do

244
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:16,649
The vegetables are washed

245
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:17,516
I'm here

246
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,485
You washed it all.

247
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:23,989
Some chores today

248
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,424
Can I take half a day off?

249
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,192
go Go

250
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:28,594
Thank you, aunt

251
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,611
why you

252
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:50,149
Where is Zhao Jian?

253
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,952
Sister Zhao’s whereabouts are restricted

254
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,153
A little person like me

255
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,354
won't be noticed

256
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,289
Do you want to use Polaris?

257
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,257
Exchange of Yuan

258
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,492
people brought

259
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:02,227
Mr. Yuan, please come with me

260
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:07,066
You stay

261
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:08,634
Protect Yuan Zhongxin

262
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:15,107
yes

263
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:46,405
Where are the soldiers and horses?

264
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:47,773
The adults ordered

265
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:48,874
I let them hide their tracks

266
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:49,875
Surround this place

267
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,410
Just wait for the adult's order

268
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:54,747
Pretty clever

269
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,015
It all depends on adult guidance

270
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,616
This matter

271
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:58,884
Your Pei family

272
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,652
No more worries

273
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:02,588
Han Duanzhang’s incident

274
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:04,289
That's it.

275
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,125
Grace

276
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,630
Isn't this the previous inn?

277
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:13,599
Why is there no one?

278
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:44,997
That's wonderful

279
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:47,633
What's wonderful

280
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,134
when we identify

281
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:52,171
Yuantianguan has abandoned this post house

282
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,772
Instead, he hid again

283
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,909
What a turnaround

284
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,144
If not for following Zhao Jian

285
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:00,879
I really didn't expect it to be here

286
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,015
It seems that it is really Yuantian Pass

287
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:05,784
Thank you sir

288
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,119
Mobilize the returning troops early

289
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,120
Surround this place

290
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,055
Let’s see where he can escape from Yuantian Pass

291
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,794
adult

292
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:17,763
What should we do next?

293
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,264
After all, Qizhai

294
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,467
He is a disciple trained by his late father.

295
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,870
Since the front yard is under the care of the Guiyuan Army,

296
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:26,972
Let's take a detour

297
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,607
Go to the backyard and watch

298
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,110
Mr. Lu is thoughtful and considerate.

299
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,474
adult

300
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:04,243
Zhao Jian went in

301
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:05,811
It seems that he has no intention of coming out

302
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:08,413
Wait a little longer

303
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:09,848
Yuan Family Father and Son

304
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:11,550
Maybe already on the way here

305
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,119
The Great Calculation of Adults

306
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:15,654
When the time comes, all troops and horses will be dispatched

307
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,356
There is no doubt that Yuantianguan will die

308
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,160
wrong

309
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:23,629
Go to the front yard again.

310
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:25,664
yes

311
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:56,161
coming

312
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,080
There's someone over there

313
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:17,716
I can see

314
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:20,719
Not a lot

315
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:22,654
Pollux is coming

316
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,256
Helping catch Mr. Yuan

317
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,424
Just sell him

318
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:26,558
compared with him

319
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,826
Brother Yuan is more important

320
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:29,728
but

321
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,130
Beihexing has many men under his command.

322
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,865
They are all Tanzhou elites

323
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,134
Yuan Tianguan is so stupid

324
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,036
Alone

325
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:39,838
who cares

326
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:43,175
Mr. Yuan is alone

327
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:46,144
I'm afraid he's not his match.

328
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:49,615
Get him for me

329
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,650
Remember to stay alive

330
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,684
superior

331
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:53,852
Come on, come on

332
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,654
Come on, come on, come on

333
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:56,688
quick

334
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:11,530
help me

335
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:14,933
help me

336
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:16,268
what are you going to do

337
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,402
I want to go home

338
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:18,570
Give me up

339
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:19,237
I want to go home

340
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:19,971
Get out of my way

341
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,073
Get out of my way

342
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,840
you

343
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:23,108
Let go of you

344
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,871
You also serve the Dragon God

345
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:00,245
yes

346
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:02,414
I didn’t believe in the Dragon God at first

347
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:03,849
But guess what

348
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:05,484
Just a blink of an eye

349
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,886
People went from Kaifeng to Tanzhou

350
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,054
You say God is not God?

351
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:12,157
Really powerful

352
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,562
but

353
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:19,331
I just don't get it

354
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:20,866
This Dragon God wants Yuan Zhongxin

355
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:21,833
what to do

356
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:24,936
It must be related to the faucet

357
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,875
You can figure this out

358
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:32,677
Ordinary people don't have the wisdom I have

359
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,714
How can we speculate on the psychology of the Dragon God?

360
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:37,149
Walk

361
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:38,884
Give you Yuan Zhongxin

362
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,081
So awesome

363
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:11,650
The name Chiyou Banner

364
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,685
Ordinary people don’t dare to accept it

365
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,825
Yuan Zhongxin is inside

366
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,495
Before Mr. Yuan goes out

367
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:24,896
And knocked people unconscious

368
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:26,231
Never seen it before

369
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:27,666
Doing this to your own son

370
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:38,944
impossible

371
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:40,545
How could there be in this world

372
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:41,713
Such a strong person

373
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:42,914
another

374
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:43,915
another

375
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:44,883
Don't come here

376
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,651
Don't, don't, don't come over

377
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:47,953
Don't, don't, don't come here

378
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:48,753
Don't come here

379
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:49,921
Don't come here Don't come here

380
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:50,722
do not come

381
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:51,890
do not come

382
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:53,425
do not come

383
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,427
He is Beihexing

384
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:57,629
To him it's Polaris

385
00:24:58,196 --> 00:24:58,930
you

386
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,600
You are complicit with him

387
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:02,868
There is a misunderstanding here

388
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:05,337
I am not Beihexing

389
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,172
I am the county magistrate of Fuya County

390
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:08,106
You in front of me

391
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:09,407
That's not what you said

392
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,677
I lied to you

393
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:13,945
I want to take advantage of you

394
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:16,014
Find the whereabouts of the Northern Star

395
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:17,949
You are Lu Nanshan’s subordinate

396
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,086
Lend me a hand

397
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:22,387
Fight against Lu Nanshan

398
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:28,627
It turns out I can’t hide it from Mr. Yuan

399
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:32,030
Even if it's not Beihexing

400
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,165
Can cut off Lu Nanshan’s men

401
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:35,166
It's also a good thing

402
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,034
Separate Separate

403
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:36,468
Mr. Yuan

404
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:37,802
you listen to me you listen to me

405
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:38,537
Lu Nanshan and I

406
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,437
Just a partnership

407
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:40,605
Not one of his men

408
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:41,306
actually

409
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:43,408
I have no ill intentions toward Mr. Yuan.

410
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:44,042
etc.

411
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:44,809
Separate Separate

412
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:45,944
He is also looking for Beihexing

413
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,345
Maybe it can help us

414
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,392
Zhao Jian never came out

415
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:01,793
Never came out

416
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,731
Something's not right

417
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:12,671
Go to the back door first

418
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:13,772
If there is a chance

419
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:14,906
Get Zhao Jian first

420
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:25,083
coming

421
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:27,652
You are here too

422
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:30,488
Xiaolu Zhangyuan

423
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:34,159
Where is Yuantian Pass?

424
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:36,428
I do not know

425
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,395
There are just three of us here

426
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:41,132
Lied to me

427
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:44,269
wrong

428
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,972
I must have lied to you.

429
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:51,576
unless

430
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:55,113
Unless you have seen through it

431
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,815
That Polaris isn't real

432
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,116
Just set up this game

433
00:26:58,316 --> 00:26:59,451
Hitting the mark

434
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:00,952
when will you

435
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,187
Found out he was fake

436
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:05,123
You said the wrong thing the first time you met me.

437
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:06,558
What did I say wrong?

438
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:08,793
Wang Kuan

439
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:11,596
Among the seven fasts and six sons

440
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:14,065
Whether it is knowledge or character

441
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:15,367
I

442
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:17,736
The one I trust most is you

443
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:20,572
What's wrong with this?

444
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:22,641
I know Qizhai

445
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,075
I heard your name again

446
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:25,877
This is not surprising

447
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,312
Actually

448
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:29,047
North River knows Wang Kuan

449
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,248
Not surprising at all

450
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:32,784
But Wang Kuan solved the mystery

451
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,953
Find Chongtian Calendar in Yushu Pavilion

452
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:36,788
What did he find in it?

453
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:38,590
clues point to

454
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:40,692
This is it

455
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:45,730
Wang Kuan

456
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,065
This puzzle is

457
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:48,800
Designed for you alone

458
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,201
River Star

459
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,437
He said this riddle

460
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:54,172
Only for Wang Kuan

461
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,707
You should believe Wang Kuan

462
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:57,575
Any questions

463
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:59,077
But the answer to the puzzle

464
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:00,879
I found it in Yushu Pavilion

465
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:03,648
You guided me to discover the Chongtian Calendar

466
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:04,716
leave a note

467
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,351
So this Chongtian calendar

468
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,053
It was hidden in Yushu Pavilion in advance.

469
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:09,320
Hiding in advance

470
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:11,556
Mr. Yuan also discovered

471
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:13,391
Actually the problem is very simple

472
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,160
Wang Kuan is in Yushu Pavilion

473
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,695
The post of Ren Zhangshu

474
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:17,495
you say

475
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,165
Who would know about this arrangement in advance?

476
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,767
Of course it’s you, Xiao Lu, Zhang Yuan

477
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:24,803
our identity

478
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:25,837
You arranged it all.

479
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:27,038
except you

480
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:28,173
No one can possibly know

481
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:29,574
Wang Kuan in Yushu Pavilion

482
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,643
So there are only two possibilities

483
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,445
Either he is fake

484
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:34,145
Either

485
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:35,814
Polaris has been hidden for many years

486
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:36,548
Actually it is

487
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,249
Xiaolu Zhangyuan, your subordinates

488
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:39,884
to this point

489
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:41,086
Whether true or false

490
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:42,654
We can't trust you anymore

491
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:43,555
Of course

492
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:45,890
From the facts, you are lying

493
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,625
What did you say just now?

494
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:50,228
Magistrate of Fuya County, right?

495
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:52,330
yes

496
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:54,399
My surname is He

497
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,368
He is the magistrate of Xiangning County

498
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,304
But all this

499
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,072
It was all under the command of Lu Nanshan

500
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:02,073
I didn't think about it

501
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,708
I am your enemy

502
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,076
You want to catch

503
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,311
Just the Northern Star

504
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:07,879
you do not say

505
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:08,913
Why arrest him?

506
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,482
This ruins people's wealth

507
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,383
Like killing parents

508
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:16,654
Just a small flaw

509
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:18,356
then identify that

510
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:20,125
The North Star is fake

511
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,193
Too arbitrary

512
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:38,443
Dean

513
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,411
The troops will not come

514
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:44,649
It's you

515
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,384
So let's talk

516
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:48,253
We can’t be arbitrary either.

517
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,054
Is there no witness to this?

518
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:55,994
Lu Nanshan wants to mobilize troops

519
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:57,395
how do you know

520
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,197
According to the orders of Xiao Lu Zhangyuan

521
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:01,199
I should be eavesdropping outside the window

522
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:02,400
I only learned about it by chance

523
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,802
But this is not the case

524
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:04,602
These words

525
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:06,204
It was Xiao Lu who taught me what he said.

526
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:07,806
I'm looking for your Polaris to be fake.

527
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:10,175
He wants to use you to follow the clues

528
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:11,576
Capture Yuantian Pass

529
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:13,711
I thought

530
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:15,647
You are loyal to Lu Nanshan

531
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,415
The letter to Han Duanzhang that year

532
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:19,651
It was also arranged by Xiao Lu Zhangyuan

533
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:21,152
The letter is in his hand

534
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:21,953
Our family's life

535
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:23,154
It's in his hands

536
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:24,656
Life is in other people's hands

537
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,891
Feeling uneasy after all

538
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:28,159
What happened back then

539
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,595
Lu Nanshan also participated

540
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:32,630
Lu Nanshan has always been ruthless

541
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:34,065
play hard

542
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:36,568
Pei Xuan, ah Pei Xuan

543
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,404
You really impress me

544
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:41,873
Don't dare

545
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:54,118
good

546
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:55,954
OK

547
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:58,990
You are all here, right?

548
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,225
There are many of you

549
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,693
I know current affairs

550
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,394
I surrender

551
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,075
Good knife skills

552
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:27,585
Carry out a sneak attack

553
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:30,855
Who doesn't know how to sneak attack?

554
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:51,109
How's it going over there?

555
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,811
The fake Beihe star is the county magistrate of Xiangning County

556
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,413
Yuantianguan gave people to us

557
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:56,614
So easy to talk to

558
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:58,883
All he wants is the Northern River Star

559
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,185
Where is the county magistrate now?

560
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:02,153
Locked up in academy

561
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:03,855
The kitchen lady is helping to watch.

562
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:05,123
Hard to fly with wings

563
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:07,892
Is it going well for you?

564
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:09,093
I met Yu Chiyuan

565
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,162
seen

566
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:13,331
Brother Yuan was rescued

567
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,366
How is he injured?

568
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:17,402
Yuan Zhongxin is missing

569
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:20,371
Where is Yuan Zhongxin?

570
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:21,439
I do not know

571
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,640
Was here just now

572
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:24,309
Could it be Yuantian Pass?

573
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:25,376
Hiding people

574
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:26,444
impossible

575
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:28,479
Mr. Yuan has always been with me

576
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:29,747
How can I have time to hide people?

577
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:30,615
What about that person?

578
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,852
Could it be the appearance of the Dragon God?

579
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:36,688
Saved people

580
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:39,157
I have no power

581
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:40,391
We also know this

582
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:41,392
Ke Yuan Zhongxin

583
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:42,493
Just disappeared

584
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,329
I doubt it

585
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:45,730
Is it ghosts?

586
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,132
Tanzhou Trip

587
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,233
The name Polaris

588
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:50,868
Always around

589
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:53,204
But this person never showed up

590
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:54,639
It will be Polaris

591
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,874
Why does he want Yuan Zhongxin?

592
00:32:59,010 --> 00:32:59,644
let's go back to

593
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,845
First question

594
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:04,816
Who is Polaris

595
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:08,886
Inexplicably disappeared and suddenly appeared again

596
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,355
And he rescued me

597
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:11,556
Dead Ghost Uncle

598
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:12,890
It's so mysterious

599
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:15,026
You were captured by Yuantianguan

600
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:16,427
We all see it

601
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:18,429
However, the force of Yuantian Pass is too high

602
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:19,630
I'm no match for him

603
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:20,398
you

604
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:22,834
who are you

605
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:24,535
River Star

606
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:25,803
want to see you

607
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,206
That's why you've been missing for so long

608
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:29,173
I saw Polaris

609
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,875
I told you at the beginning

610
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,677
I think what's going on in the world

611
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:34,412
boring boring

612
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:37,682
But what Beihexing does is different

613
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:38,649
what is the difference

614
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,485
Let him tell you himself

615
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,723
These days I ask

616
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:46,824
The puzzle of ten cents

617
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:48,393
Has been around for years

618
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:50,595
So the puzzle is real

619
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:52,597
But Wang Kuan has already solved it

620
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:53,931
The answer is Chongtian Calendar

621
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:55,266
I must have interpreted it wrong

622
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:56,834
Pei Xuan said

623
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,569
The county magistrate only learned about Chongtian Calendar

624
00:33:58,569 --> 00:33:59,203
There is no further content

625
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,071
so

626
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:01,839
Chongtian calendar is not the answer

627
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:04,108
wrong

628
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,145
Both old and new numbers can match

629
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:09,647
The puzzle must point to the Chongtian Calendar

630
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,115
But have you ever thought about it

631
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:12,550
The calendar is a commonly used book

632
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,318
Bookstores are often used as accompanies

633
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:15,586
The academy is full of students

634
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:17,155
Scholars have a calendar

635
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:18,056
Not surprising

636
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,191
Then everyone has a calendar

637
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:21,359
In which book is the answer?

638
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:23,394
No, not a certain one

639
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:25,897
is the answer to all Chongtian calendars

640
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,632
All Chongtian calendars

641
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:29,367
All are answers to riddles

642
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:31,602
So the answer

643
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:32,403
It must be nothing

644
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,371
paper clipped

645
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:35,406
But on every calendar

646
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:37,575
Here again

647
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,611
But saying

648
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:42,213
Our every move

649
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:43,514
you all know

650
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:46,651
Someone help him pay attention to you

651
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:48,252
Someone

652
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:50,455
College students

653
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:51,122
right

654
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:54,358
there are others

655
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:55,593
have

656
00:34:58,763 --> 00:34:59,764
Auntie in the kitchen

657
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:01,432
She is Beihexing

658
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:03,935
she is not

659
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,405
Then why is she helping you?

660
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:10,408
Disaster destroyed her village

661
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:11,843
ruined her family

662
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:13,144
It also ruined her life

663
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:14,312
But she didn't say

664
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:15,680
It’s because Pollux destroyed the idol

665
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,681
Did this happen?

666
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:18,082
If she didn't say that

667
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:19,684
The government office suspected her.

668
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:23,154
Then why are those victims

669
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:23,921
There are also students

670
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:25,189
Everyone is on the side of Polaris

671
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:28,626
Let him tell you

672
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:35,399
Why did you last time

673
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:36,667
Find that folder

674
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:38,669
Beihe star belongs to Jingsu

675
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:40,371
In the Chongtian calendar

676
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:41,672
Naturally recorded this calendar

677
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:42,907
The zodiac degree of Jingsu

678
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:43,708
right here

679
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:44,876
Well-house

680
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:46,711
Chongtian calendar is thirty

681
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:48,446
thirty

682
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:50,414
Since every Chongtian calendar

683
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:51,415
All are answers

684
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:52,884
That clue is

685
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,685
Well 30

686
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,188
thirty

687
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:00,892
This is the age of a person

688
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:02,994
impossible

689
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:04,028
if that is the case

690
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:05,429
The puzzles change every year

691
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:07,198
Moreover

692
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:09,033
He can't be that young, right?

693
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:11,135
Will it be on your body?

694
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:12,570
There are engraved with the number thirty

695
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,840
It's impossible to be so straightforward

696
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:19,510
I always feel like I need to change the question

697
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:20,945
River Star

698
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:22,613
Why is this puzzle given?

699
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,714
He is afraid of others

700
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:24,682
Can't find him?

701
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:26,350
zodiac degree

702
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,552
what does it mean

703
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:30,588
Wait a moment

704
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:32,123
River Star

705
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:33,424
Has been wooing college students

706
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:35,092
So the academy is also the key

707
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:35,693
But thirty

708
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,028
What does it have to do with the academy?

709
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,029
No

710
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,131
Thirty is not just a number

711
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:41,666
What else is that?

712
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,267
That’s the meaning from the beginning

713
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:44,468
Star sign

714
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,172
exactly

715
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:55,446
What did they both understand?

716
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:01,185
We are all human

717
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:02,987
Why is the difference so big?

718
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:04,956
What does Xingxiusiudu refer to?

719
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,091
Heaven

720
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:07,425
No

721
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:08,926
It’s also the human world

722
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:14,765
Just now

723
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:15,633
I saw inside the inn

724
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,235
The remaining pages of the book fell from the sky

725
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:21,706
i remember this book

726
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:23,107
Studying the art of witchcraft

727
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:24,675
There are also divination disasters

728
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:26,277
It is inevitable to also record celestial phenomena

729
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:28,012
Just reminded by Wang Kuan

730
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:28,946
I just remembered

731
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,083
Xingxiuxiudu is not just the starry sky

732
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:33,484
It’s also the human world

733
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:36,854
Don't understand

734
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:39,523
It is common for the stars to mark their directions

735
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:40,791
And the earthly place

736
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:41,926
Corresponding to the location of the constellations

737
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,194
It is also often mentioned

738
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:45,196
Heaven and man echo

739
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:46,998
So we put the stars

740
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:47,999
Move it to the ground and see

741
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,066
what would it be like

742
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:51,269
Above ground

743
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:52,803
Nothing

744
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:53,671
Academy

745
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:58,409
Academy corresponding constellation chart

746
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:00,945
Let go of the ground

747
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:02,513
Viewed from a height

748
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:05,082
The academy is a whole

749
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:19,563
What are the degrees of the zodiac like?

750
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:25,469
Just a circle

751
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,409
Substitute the academy into it

752
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,887
Well 30

753
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:44,355
Convert it

754
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:45,956
Where should it be in the academy?

755
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:03,274
It should be here

756
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:08,546
Xiao Xue

757
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:10,648
Can we still be friends?

758
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:14,318
When I practice swordsmanship

759
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:15,086
Some steps

760
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:16,520
Just follow the stars

761
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,355
So remember

762
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,760
I feel abandoned

763
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:31,769
That's where it turned out to be

764
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:36,507
Where is that?

765
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,077
You take a panoramic view of the academy

766
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:41,479
Put it into this circle

767
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,714
You can see where it is

768
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,588
Have no idea

769
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:08,839
It turns out to be you

770
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:15,446
Answers to puzzles

771
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:16,947
It's the starting point of the puzzle

772
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:19,150
The effect is the cause

773
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:20,651
person who asked the question

774
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:22,186
The answer is

775
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:25,456
to be honest

776
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,591
We also guessed it at first

777
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:29,126
but

778
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:32,797
You pretended to be deaf and there was no flaw

779
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:37,468
amazing

780
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:39,870
It is worthy of being the Northern River Star

781
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,244
he can't hear

782
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:49,847
he is deaf

783
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:52,216
Pollux is deaf

784
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:53,851
He cut his own ears with his own hands

785
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:54,852
Deaf

786
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:57,254
why

787
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:58,689
For the sake of being in Yuelu Academy

788
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:00,191
The secret of selling Polaris

789
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:02,359
To select students

790
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:04,762
In order not to let others doubt him

791
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,363
Do you know why the government office

792
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:07,465
Don't you doubt him?

793
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:08,966
Because he can't hear

794
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,434
no

795
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,003
Because he is in the next village

796
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,104
Have sons and daughters

797
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:16,307
There is land to grow and chickens to raise

798
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:19,043
Of course

799
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:20,044
Of course what

800
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:23,681
His cock is not as good as mine

801
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:26,717
But the trajectory of his life

802
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:27,918
All in the village

803
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:28,886
And he is a

804
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:30,287
Really deaf

805
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,689
If I hadn't seen him before

806
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:33,290
Who knew he was Polaris

807
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:34,492
So his children

808
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,159
all fake

809
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:36,126
real

810
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:38,496
How can it be

811
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,264
How long has he been preparing?

812
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:41,265
lifetime

813
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:43,934
He has been a farmer his whole life

814
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:48,439
so this place

815
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:51,575
It's his hometown

816
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:52,209
Yes

817
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:53,611
No wonder people

818
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:54,845
No flaws found

819
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:56,747
But why did he

820
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:58,249
To pierce your ears

821
00:41:58,649 --> 00:41:59,216
His identity

822
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:00,551
There is no flaw anymore

823
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:01,952
His old man said

824
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:03,454
The most difficult thing to control

825
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:05,289
It's just my subconscious reaction

826
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:07,024
if in ear

827
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,959
Suddenly heard a special secret

828
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,427
He was afraid he couldn't control himself

829
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:11,595
discovered by others

830
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:13,998
if deaf

831
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:15,633
It's really foolproof

832
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:18,602
As for that?

833
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,237
you know too

834
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,473
The whole Tanzhou is looking for him

835
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:23,574
Why

836
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:34,852
Just ask him

837
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:44,128
I'm going to patrol around

838
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:45,629
In case of accidents

839
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:11,755
Hello Yuan Zhongxin

840
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:13,991
I am Beihexing

841
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:17,094
In fact, I already knew

842
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,829
It’s about the secret pavilion

843
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:22,266
People are caught

844
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:24,268
But what to do next?

845
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:26,437
After all, he is an official

846
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:28,672
He not only has official status

847
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:30,240
On him

848
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,976
Maybe there's another secret hidden

849
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:34,645
The letter to Han Duanzhang that year

850
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:36,246
He also has a plan

851
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:37,314
I thought about it

852
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:39,149
maybe at that time

853
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:40,918
Unsolved riddles

854
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,553
There will be an answer now

855
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:44,121
Xiaolu Zhangyuan

856
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:46,256
You should be awake

857
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,665
What answer do you want?

858
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,066
You have a privy council

859
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:57,434
The Deputy Secretary's Mission

860
00:43:57,735 --> 00:43:58,602
so what

861
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:00,204
then

862
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:01,038
we are involved

863
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:02,272
Han Duanzhang case

864
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:04,775
Liu Sheng, the head of the Five Fasting Houses

865
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:06,043
died in prison

866
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,678
when he died

867
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:09,313
Obviously under the control of the Privy Council

868
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,347
under protection

869
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:11,815
His death

870
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:15,152
It was someone in the Privy Council who did it

871
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:19,890
Isn’t this case settled early?

872
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:25,429
Lu Nanshan

873
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:28,065
Did you kill Liu Sheng?
