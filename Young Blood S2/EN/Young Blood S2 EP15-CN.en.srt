1
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,720
You feel

2
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:03,756
Did I kill Bo Fin?

3
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,291
You have to ask yourself

4
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,399
Lu Nanshan did have someone look for me

5
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,735
Please let me kill your father

6
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:19,372
I also sneaked into Ning Lingge’s camp

7
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,112
Your father died of illness

8
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:29,516
You didn't take action

9
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,885
My son is dead

10
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:33,686
what does it matter

11
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:36,956
I look down on Yuan Zhongxin

12
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,125
so many years

13
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,760
I didn’t regard him as my son either.

14
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:42,929
Because I don't need him

15
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:46,199
but now

16
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,135
Yuan Zhongxin is my only son

17
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,071
At this moment

18
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,073
I should always think about him

19
00:02:58,411 --> 00:02:59,879
Based on your relationship

20
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,881
Why should I kill your father?

21
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,049
Empty words

22
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,350
Do you believe it?

23
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,618
I don't care

24
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:06,352
this matter

25
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,620
I will definitely get to the bottom of it

26
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:12,926
If it was your hand that moved it

27
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,363
I will definitely kill you for revenge

28
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,300
What you just said

29
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:21,768
why not

30
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:22,769
Yuan Zhongxin’s interview

31
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,637
Who should I tell him?

32
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,207
Did you just want to destroy him?

33
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,377
father

34
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,980
Disciplining your son is the right thing to do

35
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,551
You are afraid that he will go to Xixia

36
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,886
Died in Yuan Hao's hands

37
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,854
So you would rather destroy him

38
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,565
There's still a bit of a father-son relationship

39
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,399
you are wrong

40
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:56,035
I despise him

41
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,238
Don't let him go

42
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,607
I just don't want my Yuan family

43
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,175
bloodline cut off

44
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:05,178
If Bob Fin were still there

45
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:07,580
Even if he dies, I won’t

46
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,781
Take a closer look

47
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:09,916
As for hating him so much?

48
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,451
Because he is not good enough

49
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,553
What should I do if Yuan Zhongxin is really disabled?

50
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:16,823
Just don't die.

51
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:18,858
Unreasonable

52
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,294
What you can do now

53
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,696
Just give me Polaris

54
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:24,564
Then what

55
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,133
You give Beihe Star to Yuan Hao again

56
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,871
gain trust

57
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,940
Only then can we take the opportunity to kill him

58
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:35,808
Revenge for my son

59
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,543
I won't give you Polaris

60
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:40,213
child

61
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,616
Trade his life for Yuan Hao's life

62
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,851
This won't count

63
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,219
Qizhai kills Yuan Hao

64
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,420
Not for personal revenge

65
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:48,855
Why else?

66
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,056
Prevent war in the world

67
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,891
Keep the Song Dynasty peaceful in the future

68
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:52,959
Bao Da Song

69
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:55,595
Why are you guaranteed?

70
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,130
patriotism

71
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,165
patriotic

72
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:04,804
Your surname is Zhao

73
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:06,372
Of course I love it

74
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,008
But our Yuan family

75
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:10,777
It’s Xianbei bloodline

76
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,645
Tens of thousands of people in the Song Dynasty

77
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,846
Different bloodlines

78
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,649
But using the same language

79
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,052
Talking about the same love and hate

80
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:22,255
Joys and sorrows gather together, honor and disgrace

81
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,791
Hundreds and Thousands of Years

82
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:27,360
We are connected to this land

83
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,394
cannot be divided

84
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,898
Country is our common name

85
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,567
so-called patriotism

86
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:37,170
Just love ourselves

87
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:40,139
You want to impress me when you raise your profile

88
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,076
Who doesn’t know what to say?

89
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:44,510
I didn't want to impress you

90
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,582
I'm just a little sad

91
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,517
There is no need for you to feel sad

92
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:52,919
not for you

93
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,555
Actually I never thought about it

94
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:56,422
you will understand

95
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,591
It’s just that Yuan Zhongxin and Brother Yuan

96
00:05:58,591 --> 00:05:59,926
They all think so

97
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,694
They did the same

98
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,896
You never understood them

99
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,769
Young People

100
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,838
Only know blood

101
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,474
How can you understand worldly affairs?

102
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:15,641
Is there anything wrong?

103
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:29,522
I'm tired

104
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:36,496
correct

105
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:39,699
Before your father died

106
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,734
let me bring you something

107
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,142
May all things in the world

108
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:52,078
No longer stop you

109
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:43,596
yuantianguan

110
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,099
let's make a deal

111
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,370
I promise to let Yuan Zhongxin

112
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,339
Not to enter Xixia within three years

113
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:21,334
Walk

114
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,619
Why does he feel so much older?

115
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:54,734
Three years

116
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:56,435
so

117
00:08:58,237 --> 00:08:58,771
Is to agree

118
00:08:58,771 --> 00:08:59,872
The transaction of Beihexing

119
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,607
Three years

120
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,776
Another chance to kill Yuan Hao

121
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:04,844
Not a loss

122
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:06,779
What do you think?

123
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:09,482
Three Years of Business

124
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:10,416
I'm OK

125
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,251
I just don't know about Beihexing

126
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:13,052
What do you think

127
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:14,720
What if I lose money?

128
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,422
Three years of practicing swordsmanship

129
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:17,723
The one you want

130
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:19,992
OK

131
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:21,894
In this case

132
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,329
Let's meet Pollux again

133
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,363
Seal the deal

134
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:26,165
You go ahead

135
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:33,573
That He County Cheng

136
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,341
collude secretly to deceive

137
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:36,542
Steal people's property

138
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,878
I will take him back to Kaifeng

139
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,313
Discuss on national law

140
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:43,783
I've been thinking just now

141
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:44,817
The word choice

142
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,086
I am waiting for the Confucian scholar

143
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,922
How could you not know how to sacrifice your life for justice?

144
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:51,524
sacrifice one's life

145
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:54,927
I won't go with you

146
00:09:58,798 --> 00:09:59,899
I want to go back to Kaifeng

147
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:03,502
Finish my journey

148
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,329
Wang Kuan left

149
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,498
Wang Kuan won’t leave

150
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,001
Wang Kuan left

151
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:37,503
Wang Kuan won’t leave

152
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:40,606
Wang Kuan is gone

153
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:41,874
Qizhai is missing one

154
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,681
All good things come to an end

155
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:50,516
People

156
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,853
When we get together, there will be separation

157
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:57,323
But even at the ends of the earth

158
00:10:58,891 --> 00:10:59,892
Qizhai is still there

159
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,034
Brother Wang

160
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:10,403
have you ever had nightmares

161
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,407
The scariest dream I've ever had

162
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,143
Just go back to the past

163
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,979
But I didn't meet you

164
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,423
I once swore to myself

165
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:33,559
No matter what happens

166
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,927
setbacks and difficulties

167
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,563
I will always stand with you

168
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:46,972
Small Scene

169
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,875
You can go to Kaifeng with me

170
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:52,978
Of course I do

171
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,315
But I can't go

172
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:01,420
The word choice

173
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:03,456
Easier said than done

174
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:07,727
Brother Wang

175
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,930
You have to find your own way

176
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,765
I'm actually very proud

177
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,036
because you chose

178
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,238
It is a line that needs oneself

179
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,139
The road to completion

180
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:23,375
can meet you

181
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:24,877
I'm very lucky

182
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:27,980
But I won't give up on you

183
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,917
I will

184
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,853
Will make yourself better

185
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,621
Then one day

186
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,556
i will find you again

187
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:41,293
Brother Wang

188
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,531
I let go now

189
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:46,966
I'm not giving up on you

190
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,568
us

191
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:52,271
will always be together

192
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:54,874
I know

193
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:58,764
Sister Zhao

194
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:00,299
I'm fine

195
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:03,435
Brother Wang found his own

196
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:04,303
My own way

197
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,404
I'm very happy

198
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:07,606
real

199
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:53,819
What's going on here

200
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:56,555
Where is the Northern Star?

201
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:58,557
Went to the fields

202
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:00,259
fields

203
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:01,961
Weeding and fertilization

204
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:03,395
There is a lot of work in the fields

205
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,432
Shall I take you to see him?

206
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:10,903
can you

207
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:12,371
I have to go

208
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:14,206
Then let’s go

209
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:43,736
He does this every day

210
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,805
Is there farm work in this world?

211
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,073
Endless work

212
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:49,975
No wonder the government office couldn’t find it

213
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:50,843
He is Beihexing

214
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,713
If I hadn't grown up in this field

215
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,116
Who would have thought of exorcising demons for the world?

216
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,953
Tell me your decision

217
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,023
Don't discuss it with him.

218
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:05,057
Also available

219
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,326
But after talking

220
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:08,794
He will forget it tomorrow.

221
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:10,963
So serious

222
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,431
Otherwise, why are you looking for it?

223
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:13,565
Where is the inheritor?

224
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:19,838
three years later

225
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:21,440
The name of the Xixia spy

226
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,074
Give us

227
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:23,008
certainly

228
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:23,976
make a deal

229
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:25,811
Then start now

230
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:27,312
So fast

231
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:28,981
It has been prepared for you a long time ago

232
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:30,449
Wei Yuan

233
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:32,618
Follow the road to the west

234
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:33,552
There's a caravan there

235
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:34,753
He is waiting for you there

236
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,488
money earned in three years

237
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:37,556
Keep enough for your own use later

238
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,724
Send back the rest

239
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,160
Meet the caravan

240
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,094
Do you need any certificate?

241
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:42,861
unnecessary

242
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,363
What to do if you lose money

243
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,031
Beihexing believes in you

244
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:49,368
The old man is quite discerning.

245
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:54,440
these three years

246
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,775
We're afraid we won't see each other again

247
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:01,980
Still here three years later

248
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:04,383
Don't forget to come back

249
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,156
The End of the Earth

250
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:13,258
Seven fasts in one

251
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:16,328
gone

252
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:27,172
You stay to practice martial arts

253
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:28,974
His behavior is ridiculous

254
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:30,342
I'll accompany him for a while

255
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:32,511
Remember to come back

256
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:34,113
I'm here waiting for you

257
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,560
This is also considered a caravan

258
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,033
Not even a horse

259
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,437
It’s a caravan and it must have goods, right?

260
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,274
It's all straw.

261
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:03,242
under the straw

262
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,543
It's all cow dung

263
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:05,210
Yeah

264
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,012
Who wants these things?

265
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,914
Xiao Xue

266
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:10,616
That's the situation

267
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:11,283
Do you think three years

268
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:12,117
What can be the result?

269
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:13,952
Don't think about that

270
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,921
It would be nice not to starve to death

271
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:22,161
This is already the case

272
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:23,295
lets go

273
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:23,996
Where are you going?

274
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,165
have no idea

275
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:27,633
Think about it as you walk

276
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:32,738
boarding

277
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:41,847
Walk

278
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:48,020
Where is this caravan?

279
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,621
Isn’t this an escape?

280
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,138
The injury is serious

281
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:07,973
Maybe within ten years

282
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:08,874
Can't even stand up

283
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,577
we don't have that much time

284
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:13,845
Try your best

285
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:15,080
okay

286
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,482
Let's not talk about this now

287
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:19,685
These are the few of us left

288
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:21,220
What do I have to do

289
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:23,422
Each has its own arrangements

290
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:24,723
Pei Jing

291
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:27,492
You have two choices

292
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:28,260
First

293
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,362
Go out into the countryside and work alone

294
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:31,930
Secondly, follow them

295
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,198
How to do things alone

296
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:34,633
you don't want to follow them

297
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,603
I want to but I can't

298
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,404
Qizhai everyone

299
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,539
Everyone should be on their own

300
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,441
Even if it's me

301
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,610
We should move forward bravely

302
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,312
Good to work alone

303
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,815
Just rush to the place of disaster

304
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,183
Rescue victims

305
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,319
Disasters can also be divided into droughts, floods

306
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,622
Earthquake and storm disease

307
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:58,423
you choose one

308
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,858
The disease is also

309
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:00,459
yes

310
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:03,362
Then you can study medicine

311
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,329
certainly

312
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:05,998
I'll choose this

313
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:09,334
But I want to remind you

314
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:11,770
The epidemic has left corpses everywhere

315
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,972
It’s hard for disaster relief workers to come out

316
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:15,674
I can

317
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,078
Why don't you two persuade her?

318
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,453
Qizhai everyone

319
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,521
Can be independent

320
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:32,791
good

321
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:34,493
Pei Jing

322
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:36,495
You go east along this road

323
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,397
Entering the third room in the village

324
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:39,731
There is a country doctor there

325
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:40,766
Just follow him

326
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:47,673
I originally thought

327
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,342
We will always be together

328
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:51,476
will not be separated

329
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:55,380
It turns out that's not the case

330
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:56,882
Silly girl

331
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:58,950
Only three years

332
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:00,819
Then it's settled

333
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:03,889
See you in three years

334
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,094
Brother Yuan

335
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,496
I will definitely cure you

336
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,499
It's all up to you

337
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:19,604
See you or leave

338
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:37,322
Brother Wang mentioned

339
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:39,291
Master Fan said

340
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,927
Either a good appearance or a good doctor

341
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:44,896
He is going to take the path of good people and helping the world

342
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,232
Then I will go and heal the people in this world

343
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,969
Come on, Xiaojing

344
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,978
Xiao Jing, you can do it.

345
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:02,414
Qizhai everyone

346
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:03,482
Everyone should be on their own

347
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:05,450
Even if it's me

348
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:07,552
We should move forward bravely

349
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:20,699
he is injured

350
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,801
I can't separate from him

351
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:25,971
A letter from Pollux to you

352
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:26,805
You haven’t read it yet

353
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:27,572
No need to look

354
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:28,774
Just tell me

355
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:29,841
Whatever I do

356
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:31,410
You really don’t need to separate

357
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:33,078
Pollux said you two

358
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:33,912
able

359
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:35,414
Tacit Understanding

360
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,448
If we join forces

361
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,750
More useful than working alone

362
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:42,654
Uncle understands quite well

363
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:50,495
What's this

364
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:53,231
this is so many years

365
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:54,833
Inspired by Pollux

366
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,368
students in academy

367
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:57,602
List of writings

368
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:01,540
What to do for us

369
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:02,808
from now on

370
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,010
what are they going to do

371
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,912
It's up to you

372
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,680
We have the final say

373
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:10,816
No need to consult Beihexing

374
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:11,583
Need not

375
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:12,884
He is not afraid of us

376
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:14,019
sold them

377
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:17,088
He believes in you

378
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,325
Then I'll tell the truth

379
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,061
Beihexing wants to be in the academy

380
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:24,396
Find like-minded people

381
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:26,965
Indeed

382
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:29,000
But the road went astray

383
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:33,171
Reading makes sense

384
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:35,207
How can this be godless?

385
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:36,975
How can this be biased?

386
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:37,943
That's right

387
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:39,611
But their number

388
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:40,679
Far from enough

389
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:41,713
Who else are you looking for?

390
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:42,814
Anyone can do it

391
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:45,851
Juggler and restaurant owner

392
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,686
Farmer, trader

393
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:48,720
All these people can

394
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,355
Involved in his great cause of slaying demons

395
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,724
Many blind believers

396
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:53,925
Rely on a few students

397
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:55,093
How many people were saved?

398
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:55,961
There are many of them

399
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:57,095
There cannot be fewer of us

400
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:58,730
Otherwise it’s just a drop in the bucket

401
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,397
futile effort

402
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:01,533
But these people all believe in ghosts and gods

403
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:04,903
Then give them benefits

404
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,404
what's the use

405
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:08,607
As long as the benefits are enough

406
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:10,242
Don't say you believe in ghosts and gods

407
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:11,977
Even ancestral graves can be sold to you

408
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:12,911
People believe in ghosts and gods

409
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:13,845
There is comfort in my heart

410
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,213
What you do is useless

411
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,781
We can make a false god

412
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:17,849
Yuan Zhongxin

413
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:20,085
We are now exorcists of ghosts and gods

414
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:21,753
You want to create a ghost

415
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:22,954
One thing

416
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,923
Create a false god first

417
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:26,758
And then destroy it myself

418
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,059
always wakes people up

419
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,694
This is better than persuading and reasoning

420
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:30,562
Much more useful

421
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:33,732
Use extraordinary measures in extraordinary times

422
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,301
Dead Ghost Uncle

423
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:37,969
You might as well think about it

424
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,337
Beihe star for so many years

425
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:40,772
I just managed to win over a few students.

426
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:43,575
How did God create this?

427
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:45,343
We have experience in creating gods.

428
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:47,712
Do you know Bazhai's Wenwuqi?

429
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:49,080
do not know

430
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,417
Forget it if you don’t know him

431
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:54,019
This person

432
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:55,153
Quite annoying too

433
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,455
He is in Xixia now

434
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:58,523
Specialized in creating gods

435
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:01,059
I have to go to Xixia

436
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,394
Find this person here

437
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:03,929
They are all from the Secret Pavilion

438
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:05,964
If he can do it, so can I

439
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,832
Okay, okay, then let me ask you

440
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:08,533
Our first step

441
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:09,401
what should be done

442
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,002
First we have to make one

443
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:13,405
famous name

444
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,074
I get up

445
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:17,976
I have a way with naming.

446
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:31,256
Father Adult

447
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:33,925
Make a vow when you leave

448
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,362
I thought you wouldn't come back again

449
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:39,698
do you still remember yourself

450
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:40,832
Did you say that?

451
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,133
Remember

452
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,702
If you reach a dead end

453
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:45,837
I can only grit my teeth and move forward

454
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:47,939
There is no time to regret

455
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:48,974
Didn't expect it to be so soon

456
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:49,874
You will regret it

457
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:51,409
Actually, I don’t regret it either.

458
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:53,845
There's just a new way forward

459
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:54,779
what road

460
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:56,281
Those in high positions

461
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:58,717
Maybe it can save the people from fire and water

462
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:02,354
this road

463
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:04,823
I gave it to you a long time ago

464
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:06,691
Do you want to be loyal to the Song Dynasty?

465
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,995
Have you ever thought about that?

466
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:14,399
Only when you are in a high position can you do your best

467
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:15,967
There is always someone in a high position

468
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:17,702
There is no shortage of Wang Kuan

469
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,671
The words still ring in my ears

470
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,673
This changes the course

471
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,874
after i leave

472
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,210
The hope of the next generation of the Wang family

473
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:26,444
In whose hands?

474
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,681
Those cousins ​​of yours

475
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:32,217
On knowledge and character

476
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,852
I may not lose to you

477
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:34,953
i want to see them

478
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:36,287
Want to fight

479
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:38,723
It's not impossible

480
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:39,891
Wang Kuan

481
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,960
It is common for people to take the wrong path

482
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:44,195
But you have to learn to admit your mistakes

483
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:46,564
If you are in front of me

484
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:47,499
Can't even bow their heads

485
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:48,366
How can I take it back?

486
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:49,734
one's own position

487
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:52,470
How can I gain a foothold in the court?

488
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,172
As a Confucian scholar

489
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,174
The truth that is hard but easy to break

490
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,543
You should understand

491
00:27:58,743 --> 00:27:59,778
Hard and easy to break

492
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:01,379
Soft and permanent

493
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:03,281
This comes from Taoism

494
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:04,816
Not Confucian

495
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:05,717
you

496
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,729
Please father, give me a chance

497
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:19,931
Let me meet my cousin

498
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:27,539
so many years

499
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,742
I've never seen you like this

500
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:32,577
I thought

501
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,880
you will never bow your head

502
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:37,816
I used to be unwilling to bow my head

503
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:40,151
It’s the pride and self-respect in my heart

504
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,454
I always feel that scholars should be proud

505
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:43,354
what about now

506
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,523
Your pride is gone.

507
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,292
Someone asked me to choose

508
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,360
For the Song Dynasty

509
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:50,995
What am I willing to give up?

510
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:52,263
what is your answer

511
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:53,832
Everything can be given up

512
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:04,242
Be flexible

513
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,478
This is the first step to establish a foothold in the court

514
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,712
It's standing still.

515
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:09,714
correct

516
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:12,817
What about Pei Jing?

517
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:14,853
She didn't return to Kaifeng

518
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:16,688
Wouldn't you marry her only?

519
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,556
To return to the Wang family

520
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:20,158
Can't have her

521
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,797
good

522
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,365
I'll give you a chance

523
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:28,933
To take back what should have been

524
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,001
everything that belongs to you

525
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:31,369
Get up

526
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:38,810
I heard you brought someone back with you

527
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:41,279
Magistrate of Ning County, Jinghu South Road Township

528
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,281

Another witness

534
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:50,922
Should be dealt with according to national law

535
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,857
Recent rumors on Jinghu South Road

536
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:54,859
There is a new god in the countryside

537
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:57,262
Do you know the details of this?

538
00:29:58,163 --> 00:29:59,164
What new god

539
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:02,634

Let's talk

547
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:25,723
Why that place?

Opening Gate

549
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:28,159
Let me tell you this slowly.

550
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:31,296
Have you heard?

551
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:32,263
Give me back the money?

552

Secondary School

557
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:40,872
You don't understand this

558
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:41,840
Add a bowl of wontons

559
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,473
okay

560
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,942
Taoist temple

561
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:45,577
Don't touch this kind of place

562
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:46,811
Every town

563
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:48,079

You can smash it.

565
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,381
Many people have received money

566
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:52,717
What a good deal, right?

567
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,752
This smashing of the idol will kill the disaster

568
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,087
Will there be retribution?

569
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:56,955
Look, let me tell you

570
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:57,856
It's fine

571

It's a worship of the son

582
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,441
No wonder

583
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:17,642
I'll just say it

584
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:20,712
Pay homage to the current saint

585
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:21,379
yes

586
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:24,716
Some people believe this

587
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:27,719
In the eyes of the people

588
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,354
Holy lord, that is the emperor

589
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:30,822
How big is the emperor?

590
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:31,856
Pay homage to ghosts and gods

591
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:32,657
Not too much

592
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,926
This is the crime of deceiving the emperor.

593
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:38,663
Zhao Jian chose the name well.

594
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:41,432
Now the Privy Council

595
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:42,967
It's already a mess

596
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:45,169
Everyone is exhausted

597
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:46,404
This matter has nothing to do with the Privy Council

598
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,372
what is the relationship

599
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:50,541
Nanshan God has a good name

600
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:53,044
What's wrong

601
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:55,813
That god already has a portrait

602
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:57,849
Do you know whose face it is?

603
00:31:58,049 --> 00:31:58,816
whose face

604
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:05,423
Lu Nanshan

605
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,291
it's him

606
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:08,359
At least there is one

607
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,461
The Vice-Chairman of the Privy Council is here to

608
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:11,763
now

609
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:13,798
He actually put his own face

610
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:14,999
Painted as idols

611
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,501
This is not bad

612
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,203
The Privy Council has requested an order to seize him.

613
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:22,974
Dark enough

614
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,246
Minamiyama God

615
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:29,380
Minamiyama God

616
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,581
Minamiyama God

617
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:31,516
Minamiyama God

618
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:32,684
Minamiyama God

619
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:33,818
Minamiyama God

620
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:34,886
Minamiyama God

621
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:35,920
Minamiyama God

622
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,155
Minamiyama God

623
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:38,222
Minamiyama God

624
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:39,324
Minamiyama God

625
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:40,191
Minamiyama God

626
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:41,192
Minamiyama God

627
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:42,293
Minamiyama God

628
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,294
Minamiyama God

629
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,362
Minamiyama God

630
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:45,263
Minamiyama God

631
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:57,175
Nanshan God is just a transition

632
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:59,310
That is, use this name first

633
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,511
Sweep a batch of old gods

634
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:01,479
Turn back to ourselves

635
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,981
Destroy the Nanshan God again

636
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:04,716
This happens again and again

637
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:07,251
How much does someone understand?

638
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:09,053
The reason why ghosts and gods cannot be trusted

639
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,121
certainly

640
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:12,223
And the most important thing

641
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:13,191
Which point

642
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:15,393
If the government investigates it later,

643
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,362
The unlucky one is Lu Nanshan.

644
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,397
You are really black

645
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,099
Director Xiao Lu said it himself

646
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,568
If there is a chance to save the Song Dynasty from danger,

647
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:25,636
He is willing to dedicate everything to the Song Dynasty

648
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,207
i am willing to give everything

649
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:31,776
we just try our best

650
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:33,011
meet his needs

651
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:35,913
Shameless

652
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:37,248
You are too shameless

653
00:33:58,302 --> 00:33:59,370
I heard that you recently

654
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,738
I visited many temples

655
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:02,640
Excellent results

656
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,641
Everybody is a soldier

657
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:07,712
Didn't you meet some tough people?

658
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,914
you didn't notice

659
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:12,016
Haven't you seen Zhao Jian during this time?

660
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:24,729
Boss

661
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,365
Boss and the others are all here

662
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,299
On the way

663
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:29,567
To take the statue back

664
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:32,303
It's really strange.

665
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,005
I have letters and everything.

666
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:36,207
You said that if you believe in fox demons and tiger spirits

667
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:37,275
That's all

668
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:38,743
Damn it

669
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:40,211
Some people believe in millstones

670
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:41,012
God of Mopan

671
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:42,713
Have been in this village for several years

672
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:44,115
That’s why the village next door

673
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:45,383
Never dealt with them

674
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:46,217
Why

675
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:48,086
The next village worships the bean god

676
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,922
Bean rice, Jiwheat, bean sprouts

677
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:51,923
right

678
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,858
Isn't that the Soybean God?

679
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:54,892
No wonder

680
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:56,260
Can't deal with the God of Millstone

681
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,396
The boss is about to grab the millstone.

682
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,608
Don't hurt anyone

683
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:12,009
Call me back

684
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:15,446
Hit it back, hit it back

685
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:18,850
Hit it back, hit it back

686
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:22,086
Hit it back, hit it back

687
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:24,288
Zhao Jian's family is like this

688
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,289
Called

689
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,158
Sweeping holes in the courtyard

690
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:28,526
Rise to kill

691
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,695
Is it so smooth?

692
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:34,699
Participants

693
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,434
Everyone has copper coins to take

694
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:38,970
While Zhao Jian was taking action

695
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,738
I will also treat these liars

696
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:41,372
means of making money

697
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:42,406
exposed

698
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:43,774
since then

699
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:45,443
I'm afraid there are many people

700
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:47,011
I can't believe this scam anymore.

701
00:35:58,222 --> 00:35:59,257
come here

702
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:00,892
Come one or two

703
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:02,126
three

704
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,134
I still don't know something

705
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:11,402
You say

706
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:12,503
This is Wei Yuan’s business

707
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,738
No improvement yet

708
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:14,739
You guys

709
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,141
Money to make statues of gods and open temples

710
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:18,276
Where did it come from?

711
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:19,844
Found a sponsor

712
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:21,779
Who?

713
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:39,163
It is you

714
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:41,732
Where did you get the money?

715
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,367
My home is in Kaifeng City

716
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,368
Jieshen Lane

717
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,303
So what

718
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:46,971
you should know

719
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,439
Jieshen Lane Gold and Silver Trading

720
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:49,340
Lots of buying and selling

721
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:51,475
Give me

722
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:52,443
The numbers are correct, right?

723
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:53,211
That's right

724
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:54,912
People who do big business

725
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:56,581
Not short of this little money

726
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:57,715
what business to do

727
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:00,484
First, the middle line

728
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:02,887
Then I also do some business myself

729
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,488
So you are rich

730
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:06,257
Saved some property

731
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:07,358
Then why do you still want to take refuge?

732
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:08,392
That Lu Nanshan

733
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,497
one two three

734
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,236
If you have money, you must first have the life to spend it.

735
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:20,938
rich

736
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:22,139
If you have money, invest it

737
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:23,274
Come into this bottomless pit

738
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:25,042
Guaranteed by Wei Yuan’s personality

739
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,877
I will return it to him when I make money in the future.

740
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:30,615
Money or not is a trivial matter

741
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:32,883
I just want to ask Mr.

742
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:35,720
How is my sister doing now?

743
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:46,364
Why sleep in a coffin

744
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:49,300
In a plague-stricken area, nine out of ten houses are empty.

745
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:50,635
furniture in the house

746
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:51,736
All stolen and sold

747
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:53,037
What about the coffin?

748
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:55,840
What do you mean, sister?

749
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,675
It's time to prepare the funeral arrangements first.

750
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,543
If something unexpected happens

751
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:01,078
It is also more convenient

752
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:02,813
Why do you need this convenience?

753
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:04,282
Can you please bring my sister back?

754
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:05,850
This is what your sister means

755
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:08,619
Lime is now spreading on the streets

756
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,553
Burn the body

757
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:10,921
She's good at it all

758
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,391
The local doctor said

759
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:14,125
no holiday

760
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,493
Then she can consult independently

761
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:18,562
Why work so hard?

762
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:25,936
My sister is compared with before

763
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,938
The changes are really big.

764
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:28,739
yes

765
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,474
After entering Qizhai

766
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:31,742
Everyone has changes

767
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:32,910
including you

768
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:36,013
It's all them

769
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:37,682
Taught me bad

770
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:45,556
correct

771
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:46,724
Nanshan God builds momentum

772
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:47,725
The effect is almost the same

773
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:48,659
You can take Lu Nanshan

774
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:49,460
Back to Kaifeng

775
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:50,394
I

776
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:52,096
Zhao Jian and I

777
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:52,930
Too busy

778
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:54,699
Could you please make a trip?

779
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,334
Don't kill him

780
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,035
He killed Liu Sheng

781
00:38:58,836 --> 00:38:59,870
What was violated was the national law

782
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:02,873
There should be punishment by national law

783
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:05,810
But after all, he has a Privy Council status

784
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:06,610
Do not worry

785
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,045
Now the first one wants to take his

786
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:09,613
It's the Privy Council

787
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:11,916
Will you be surrendered?

788
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:12,817
Where is the evidence?

789
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:15,653
This face and this name

790
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:17,021
All that is available is his.

791
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:21,792
Then I'll leave now

792
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:23,694
Then I won't send it.

793
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:37,641
Aren't you afraid that he will

794
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:39,009
Let Lu Nanshan go

795
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,245
Xiaojing, the younger brother

796
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:42,680
Perseverance

797
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:44,281
If one day

798
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:45,616
If the Secret Pavilion is reorganized

799
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,718
Maybe he should be one of them

800
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:49,286
correct

801
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:51,455
Let me tell you something

802
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:53,491
Xue Ying

803
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:55,126
Never came back to me

804
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,162
maybe everyone

805
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:00,498
Everyone has their own path to take, right?

806
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:09,607
I'm going back to Kaifeng.

807
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:11,675
Xiao Luzhangyuan has good vision

808
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:14,678
Yuan Zhongxin

809
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:16,247
Hand me over

810
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:19,250
Brother Yuan said

811
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,484
You should be governed by the laws of the country

812
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,487
I can't die

813
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:24,889
Why

814
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:27,525
because of what i did

815
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:28,559
It's all right

816
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,563
I am the hope of the Song Dynasty

817
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:36,300
I admire you.

818
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:40,938
Even if you kill countless people

819
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:42,606
Rebellion and separation

820
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:44,608
You never doubted yourself

821
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,611
Sometimes I really can't help but think

822
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:49,680
Maybe you didn't deserve to die.

823
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,117
maybe one day

824
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,919
You can really make a comeback

825
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:58,255
It should be so

826
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:16,474
But I don't want that day to come

827
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,342
Because that day

828
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:19,477
You will never let it go

829
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,444
Our Pei family

830
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:26,016
I I swear

831
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,251
I swear

832
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:29,086
I don't believe this

833
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:04,255
hurry up

834
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:05,856
Wait for me

835
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,658
hurry up

836
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,131
I'm back

837
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,300
came back

838
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,234
are you tired

839
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:18,903
Sit together and eat

840
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:20,037
look at you

841
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:21,238
Been out for so many days

842
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:22,806
I don’t know how to write a letter back.

843
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,808
What are you still doing?

844
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:25,876
Mr. Wei said it all

845
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:26,977
Let you sit down

846
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:27,778
Come quickly

847
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:28,913
Wait a moment

848
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:31,181
You eat first

849
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:32,049
Let's go out

850
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:33,284
good

851
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:34,285
Walk

852
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,324
Why are you at my house?

853
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:41,659
Borrowing

854
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:42,593
Why borrow?

855
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:43,594
Save money

856
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:44,762
You don't take care of the caravan anymore

857
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,164
Why run a caravan?

858
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:48,165
You have to make money

859
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:49,166
That's too slow

860
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,534
so what

861
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:51,969
Gold and silver trading in Jieshen Lane

862
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:53,170
I also started

863
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,639
Do you want to do this too?

864
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:56,407
No, no, no

865
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,008
Not just a hand

866
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,643
I think gold and silver trading

867
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:00,277
not enough

868
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:02,012
What do you mean by not enough?

869
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:04,014
I think everything can be traded

870
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,418
silk jade

871
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:09,820
Even rice and vegetables

872
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:11,155
Jieshen Lane

873
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:11,922
Transaction exchange

874
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,257
impossible

875
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:14,758
Who would want such a thing

876
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:16,293
You do not understand

877
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:18,395
Everything in this world

878
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:19,897
All are sources of wealth

879
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,800
That's not right either

880
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:24,735
You can't always use specialties from different places

881
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:25,836
Bring them all to Kaifeng

882
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:26,770
No need to transport it

883
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,871
How to trade if you are not lucky?

884
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,607
Trading is an imaginary number

885
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,941
It is a symbol of goods

886
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:33,811
What imaginary number symbolizes

887
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:34,645
I dont understand

888
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:40,417
For example, ten kilograms of venison

889
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:42,620
This venison is not in Jieshen Lane

890
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:43,687
But we can start first

891
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:44,622
trading swap

892
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:45,422
For example

893
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,591
You exchanged rice wine for my venison

894
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:49,526
Then bring me the venison

895
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:51,662
Then you can't get it again

896
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:52,396
Ten pounds of venison

897
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:53,931
Go get this year’s new tea

898
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:55,933
But I actually got nothing

899
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:57,901
In exchange for the right to belong

900
00:43:58,769 --> 00:43:59,803
What about venison?

901
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:00,537
It doesn't matter anymore

902
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:01,639
How could it not be important?

903
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,873
The person who finally belongs

904
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:04,375
If you don’t want to change anything

905
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:05,776
I'll have the venison

906
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:06,777
Send to his house

907
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:09,246
this kind of transaction

908
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:10,414
once started

909
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,182
It's hard to stop

910
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:13,751
I do not understand

911
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:16,153
This back and forth exchange

912
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,287
How to make money

913
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:21,659
you do not understand

914
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,894
This is a cornucopia
