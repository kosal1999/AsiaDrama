1
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:48,741
It’s time for chicken soup too

2
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:49,542
Yeah

3
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,311
The chicken soup has been simmering until now

4
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,445
It's time

5
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:53,513
Yeah

6
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:55,615
That little scene, let’s go

7
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:56,850
Go help your mother with some work

8
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,351
Excuse me

9
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,452
Let's go out for a while

10
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:00,420
Walk, walk, walk fast

11
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,154
A Xuan

12
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:02,422
You accompany the prince.

13
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,756
I'm going to check out the chicken soup

14
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:05,024
Prince Wang

15
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:05,892
fine

16
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:06,860
Sit down

17
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:09,062
daughter

18
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:11,564
close close

19
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:13,533
Come

20
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,835
Come sit down baby

21
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:17,971
daughter

22
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:19,572
father

23
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:21,307
long time no see

24
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:26,446
thank you

25
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:30,783
father

26
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,285
You have gray hair again

27
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,053
This is not important

28
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:35,488
You and Prince Wang

29
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,623
What step have you reached?

30
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:39,826
No need to hide your family

31
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:40,793
Tell it like it is

32
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:43,296
Love each other

33
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,298
Have vision

34
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,468
The son who can catch Wang Xianggong

35
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,970
It is indeed our little scene.

36
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,740
Although it is impossible to tell that the matchmaker is marrying

37
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,375
You can always make an outdoor room

38
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:56,142
yes

39
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:57,610
A worry-free life

40
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:58,444
yes

41
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,146
What kind of outer room?

42
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,149
What is the identity of Wang Xianggong?

43
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,685
You can still be our in-laws

44
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:10,190
Yes, the Wang family has talked to us

45
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,592
People are also reasonable

46
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,861
Not trying to break you up

47
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:16,796
As long as you don't have a name

48
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,431
We can still be together

49
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,138
It doesn't have to be this way

50
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,140
Mr. Wang is too polite.

51
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:36,382
My parents are old.

52
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,619
Seeing that you can find a home

53
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:42,188
I'm also happy in my heart

54
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,657
The Wang family has sent word

55
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,427
He said that as long as you can take this step back,

56
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,795
can make your brother

57
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,530
Entered the Sixth Ministry as an official

58
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:51,931
There is a real seal

59
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,234
From now on, it will never be the same again

60
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,868
Official status without power

61
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,805
Reunion

62
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,175
That's all you tell me

63
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:02,976
this

64
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,144
This is business

65
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:05,979
right

66
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,747
Your brother's future

67
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,449
It's all on you.

68
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,250
yes

69
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:12,485
right

70
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:14,454
Your brother

71
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:15,822
It's all up to you

72
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:20,460
can hear

73
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:22,862
Good to go there

74
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:23,796
Come, come, come

75
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:24,664
Go over there and say

76
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:25,465
daughter

77
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,233
No

78
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,436
you agreed

79
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,672
actually

80
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,173
so-called status

81
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:35,508
I don't care

82
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,543
The legal wife is also good

83
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,045
Even the outer room

84
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,048
As long as I can be with Brother Wang

85
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:44,684
enough

86
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,453
Isn’t that the truth?

87
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,555
The children have grown up and become sensible

88
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:50,056
yes

89
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,428
Even if you have no status

90
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,263
I should call you brother-in-law

91
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:00,266
It really doesn't matter

92
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,669
But I can't promise you

93
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:04,704
Xiao Jing

94
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:06,673
Don't be confused

95
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:07,173
yes

96
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:08,574
Let's go, let's talk over there

97
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:08,975
Walk

98
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,677
Brother Wang told me

99
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,578
We want to come together

100
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,013
It won't be easy

101
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:15,748
I promised him

102
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:17,617
We have to face it together

103
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,152
The difficulties and obstacles in this world

104
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,256
He doesn't give in

105
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,791
I won't give in

106
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,195
child

107
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,030
You must understand

108
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:31,764
yes

109
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:32,565
You can't

110
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,867
Marry into the Wang family in a formal ceremony

111
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:36,569
Don't be too greedy

112
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:37,770
Make an outdoor room

113
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:38,905
Live peacefully

114
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:39,339
Yes

115
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,340
Is it not good

116
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:42,108
Xiao Jing

117
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,544
Think about your home

118
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:45,912
Think about your brother

119
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:46,379
right

120
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,014
If he can enter the six departments

121
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,183
Then he has unlimited prospects

122
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,050
yes

123
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,656
But I can't let down Brother Wang

124
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,925
How do you call this a letdown?

125
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:01,094
Can't you be together?

126
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:01,427
Yes

127
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:02,428
But this is different

128
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:08,701
Xiao Jing

129
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,903
We are all for your own good

130
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,506
The Wang family will not recognize you

131
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:13,873
right

132
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,174
Brother Wang recognizes me

133
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:16,309
enough

134
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:17,977
you

135
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,053
Parents

136
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:28,621
sorry

137
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,490
Even if you hate me and blame me

138
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,791
Only this thing

139
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:33,126
I will never give in

140
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:35,728
if not

141
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,264
I can't be with him

142
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:39,632
Standing side by side

143
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,009
Prince Wang

144
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:52,912
Prince Wang

145
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:11,631
Mr. Pei

146
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:12,732
Don't dare to take it

147
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:13,833
You and Han are broken

148
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,168
There has been correspondence

149
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:16,068
Had

150
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,145
I see

151
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,413
late night visit

152
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:28,648
Sorry to bother you

153
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:31,417
Small Scene

154
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:33,186
let's go

155
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,769
This little scene

156
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,504
How did she become like this?

157
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,172
She used to be so obedient

158
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:53,873
Really

159
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:53,232
Princess

160
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:54,066
Slower

161
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,104
Prepare some hot rice porridge for me

162
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,772
It's always hot

163
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,007
I'll bring it over right away

164
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,009
Prepare another carriage

165
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,413
It's not day yet

166
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:08,915
I have to go out now

167
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:10,850
hear me out

168
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,820
Put blankets on the carriage

169
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,790
When driving later

170
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,659
I will rest in the car

171
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:21,527
Wake me up when you arrive

172
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,698
It's better to get some rest before going out.

173
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,233
besides

174
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,669
I have to trouble you with some things

175
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,204
good

176
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:54,827
Princess

177
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:55,728
Here we are

178
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,355
Princess Zhao, the head of the court, is here

179
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,091
I see

180
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:53,953
It's really unexpected.

181
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,088
Princess Zhao actually came

182
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:57,957
I'm not in a good mood

183
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,625
I won't be polite with you.

184
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,332
Look at you like this

185
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,734
You should have a good rest

186
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,205
I Yuan Zhongxin

187
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:14,707
Leave it to you these days

188
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:16,509
What happened?

189
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:17,810
what do i want to ask

190
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:19,345
You catch him

191
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:21,580
Definitely trying to get it from him

192
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,648
get something

193
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,717
It doesn’t matter what it is.

194
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,252
But I believe

195
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,387
You don't have an answer yet

196
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:30,222
why do you think so

197
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,659
I know Yuan Zhongxin

198
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,395
His mind is beyond ordinary people

199
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,030
no matter what you want

200
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,231
If he doesn't want to answer

201
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:41,534
You won't get anything

202
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,270
Princess Zhao came to visit in person

203
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:45,604
Just to talk to me

204
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,206
Yuan Zhongxin's Mind

205
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,774
I can persuade him

206
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:50,309
you

207
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,545
I am the most suitable candidate

208
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:53,813
betray him

209
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:55,781
you can let me try

210
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:56,916
Excuse me then

211
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:58,484
what do you want

212
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:00,486
I want to help him

213
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,259
you do not need to worry

214
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:09,128
In my current state

215
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,731
How is it possible to rob a prison and save someone?

216
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,537
what we want is

217
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,072
Where are the Yuan family members?

218
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,274
Is there anyone in the court?

219
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:23,776
Cooperate with Yuanjia

220
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,344
The most important thing

221
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,980
Where is Yuan Zhongxin’s father?

222
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,354
good

223
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,390
I see

224
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:39,725
I'll ask him

225
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:41,227
Not urgent

226
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:43,329
Take a break first

227
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,131
Need not

228
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,533
Aren't you afraid that he will hate you?

229
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,704
Does he hate me?

230
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,072
What does it have to do with you

231
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,108
Please lead the way

232
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,415
The princess’s current physical condition

233
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,417
It's really not appropriate to come here

234
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:08,354
This kind of place

235
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,489
There is no suitable time to come

236
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,429
What is my original intention?

237
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:18,831
I don't want to execute

238
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,699
But this is the Privy Council

239
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,735
I can't interfere too much.

240
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,170
not to mention

241
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,272
The Yuan family is very involved

242
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:30,309
Yuan Zhongxin is now

243
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,510
the only clue

244
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,012
I see

245
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:34,213
maybe you will say

246
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,815
Yuan Zhongxin is innocent

247
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:37,216
But you know

248
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:38,117
This treason

249
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,052
But the crime of killing everyone

250
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,388
Even if he is innocent

251
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,490
He also has to admit his guilt and punishment

252
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:45,891
And this life

253
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,526
Time is running out

254
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:49,528
I know

255
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,496
so

256
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,931
Advise him well

257
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,233
Let him tell everything he knows

258
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,069
This is actually saving him

259
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:58,137
at least

260
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,738
How long are you going to keep talking nonsense?

261
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,111
Ready

262
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:08,214
You guys wait for me outside the cell

263
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,218
rest assured

264
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:13,886
Even if I'm crazy

265
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:14,954
I want to save him.

266
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,589
You can also rush in immediately

267
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:39,912
no way

268
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,814
I can only tighten his hand

269
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:43,949
Otherwise he will untie it himself

270
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,592
Yuan Zhongxin

271
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,164
Yuan Zhongxin

272
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:10,910
You came

273
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,125
If I had known I would have washed my face

274
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:30,529
I look ugly like this now

275
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,765
I washed him

276
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,100
Who asked you?

277
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:37,703
fine

278
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,372
God will wash your face for you

279
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:48,747
They asked me to ask you

280
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:50,582
Do you know where your father is?

281
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,017
I really do not know

282
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:53,585
I trust you

283
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,056
them

284
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,291
Let you ask me something

285
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:01,627
I want

286
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,696
Find a way to make it up a little bit

287
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,030
Make it easy for you to do business

288
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,500
the weather is nice today

289
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:13,005
yes

290
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,174
sunny

291
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,344
Quite suitable

292
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:20,145
suitable for what

293
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,547
After returning to Kaifeng

294
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,415
I have been kneeling before the soul

295
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,184
Never rested

296
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,419
Because I want to apologize to my father

297
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,054
What are you apologizing for?

298
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,327
Yuan Zhongxin

299
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,098
I'm too willful.

300
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:41,934
What about these days?

301
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:43,369
I asked my family to help me

302
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:44,837
Did a lot of things

303
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:46,805
they were all frightened

304
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,942
Because it's during the funeral

305
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,012
things i asked them to do

306
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,246
It's all against etiquette

307
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,749
Maybe you'll get struck by lightning.

308
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,619
What's so serious?

309
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,065
I redid two birthday posts

310
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,533
this is mine

311
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:15,834
this is yours

312
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,337
That's right

313
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,905
I made one for you too

314
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:21,740
If there are some in it

315
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,875
Errors and Omissions

316
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,510
You better not be angry with me

317
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,611
Just bear with it

318
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,181
Why do you make a birthday message?

319
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:32,751
Yuan Zhongxin

320
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,555
Let’s get married

321
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,426
What kind of method is this?

322
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,294
not my business

323
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:44,863
Just handed the person over

324
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,365
Why do we need to get married?

325
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:47,766
how could I know

326
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,935
Then I'll go in and stop you.

327
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,404
Listen to what they have to say

328
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,207
you

329
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,009
Say it again

330
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,578
I heard wrong

331
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,380
Yuan Zhongxin

332
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:05,751
Let’s get married

333
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:11,824
here

334
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:16,228
Now

335
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:19,531
Didn't I tell you?

336
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:23,702
The sun is very good today

337
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:29,708
natadogina levy

338
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,111
Welcome this

339
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,579
Nothing can be done

340
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:34,913
Save it

341
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,754
lifelong events

342
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,224
Just save it

343
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,692
Why not?

344
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,268
I thought it was normal

345
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,636
I am the best

346
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,672
unruly

347
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:01,707
What about that one?

348
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:04,543
I didn’t expect the critical moment

349
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:05,777
You are much crazier than me

350
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:10,149
Then you promised me

351
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,185
I want to think about it

352
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,654
What do I have in mind?

353
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:19,791
Of course I do

354
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,004
Look at what you look like now

355
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,407
You can’t even hold a scarf during worship, right?

356
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,209
Then you have the right

357
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:38,911
Just find a loser

358
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:40,712
Then I’m not at a loss

359
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:43,649
I owe you first.

360
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:50,589
Are there any scented candles?

361
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,393
What do you say?

362
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,829
No wine either

363
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,298
Forget it

364
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:01,333
Forget it

365
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,134
forgive them

366
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:03,268
What kind of broken cell is this?

367
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:05,370
Being married is so awkward

368
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,739
forgive them

369
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,345
Let me discuss something with you

370
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:15,547
All the property is yours to take care of

371
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:16,848
Isn't this nonsense?

372
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:17,749
you have nothing

373
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:18,884
It's definitely my responsibility

374
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,085
I owe it first

375
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,354
Let's talk business

376
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:27,726
My father passed away

377
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,262
I'm still in mourning period

378
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,030
So we are talking about this marriage?

379
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:33,232
It can only be considered tentative

380
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:35,234
After the period of mourning is over

381
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,235
Talent counts

382
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:39,738
Makes sense

383
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,543
So we are now

384
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,411
Not considered a couple yet

385
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:47,646
Not yet

386
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:52,017
Yayuki

387
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:54,286
This is going to suddenly make me change my tune.

388
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:55,754
I'm still a little used to it

389
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,791
It's true that I'm not used to it

390
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:02,594
This private contract is settled

391
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,331
According to the laws of the Song Dynasty

392
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:09,434
Even private deeds are subject to deed tax

393
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:11,703
How to collect this?

394
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:13,705
have no idea

395
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:15,741
Forty articles per pass

396
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:17,542
That's called the cattle and horse tax

397
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,579
How to calculate marriage deed tax?

398
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,180
Various laws of the Three Divisions

399
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,915
No tax on private marriage contracts

400
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,751
The Song Dynasty really wanted to collect this kind of tax

401
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,152
It should have been over long ago

402
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:28,754
Long live the Song Dynasty

403
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,624
Borrow a knife

404
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:35,394
Salary

405
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:36,728
give her

406
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:38,397
It's all been like this

407
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,865
Do you still care about a knife?

408
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:01,953
Birthday messages were also exchanged

409
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,355
The private contract has also been finalized

410
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,157
There has to be a witness, right?

411
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:27,346
look

412
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:29,781
concentric knot

413
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,150
Think of it as a wedding ceremony

414
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,653
The ceremony of bunking

415
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:37,422
It's for couples to worship each other.

416
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:38,790
In the bridal chamber

417
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:42,794
You only feel it now

418
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:44,229
Isn't it inappropriate for etiquette?

419
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,331
Too

420
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:53,405
Yuan Zhongxin

421
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:55,607
What about the keepsake?

422
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:57,342
I accepted it

423
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,414
This private contract cannot be changed.

424
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:05,851
Thousands of miles apart

425
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:09,588
The erosion of time cannot change it

426
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:12,224
In charge of this

427
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,411
Just take it as a witness

428
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:40,645
OK

429
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:43,715
The ritual has become

430
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:44,649
Kissed too

431
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,685
Mrs. Yuan

432
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:48,653
Should I persuade him to do something?

433
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:50,222
lied to you

434
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:51,957
Borrow an excuse

435
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:53,258
Otherwise, how could we see him?

436
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:00,131
Then you before

437
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:01,633
Why hand him back?

438
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,436
This matter is unreasonable

439
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:05,670
Ridiculous

440
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:08,607
I have a weird temper

441
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:09,908
Whatever you think, you will do it.

442
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:10,942
Please bear with me

443
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:18,583
OK

444
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:20,252
never mind

445
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,487
Seeing you two

446
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:24,389
For the sake of separation and death

447
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:25,457
I won't pursue

448
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:27,425
What do you mean

449
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,227
I said

450
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,730
Treason is a crime punishable by execution

451
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,832
Even the princess, you don’t care about him

452
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,333
What's the use of having him?

453
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:39,004
He will be taken to the execution ground soon

454
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:40,739
beheading

455
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:43,542
Is there anything else to say?

456
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:44,910
Xiaolu Zhangyuan

457
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,914
Aren't you afraid of long nights and many dreams?

458
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:51,917
What's the meaning

459
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:54,452
what do you think

460
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:56,154
I don't care

461
00:25:57,756 --> 00:25:59,257
Xiaolu Zhangyuan might as well hurry up

462
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:02,394
good

463
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:03,828
as you wish

464
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:05,196
three days later

465
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,464
Immediate execution

466
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:08,133
Sure enough it's fast enough

467
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:10,869
do me a favor

468
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:11,970
explain

469
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:14,573
I really don't want to die

470
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:17,275
three days later

471
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:18,610
Call Wang Kuan and the others

472
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:20,412
Rob a court

473
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:23,348
Call Wang Kuan and the others

474
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,584
The Jie Dharma Hall is crowded and lively

475
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:26,418
good

476
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:28,653
Three days

477
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,088
Can you hold it?

478
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:30,989
I try my best

479
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,261
Xiaolu Zhangyuan

480
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,996
Then see you in three days

481
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:38,997
Think it over

482
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:40,832
Privy Council Court

483
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:43,501
Any action is a capital offense

484
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:46,471
Nothing can be done

485
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:47,973
Who made the private contract?

486
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,644
I'll keep the birthday invitation for you.

487
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:15,033
You Qizhai

488
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:17,102
Are they all so lawless?

489
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:18,870
Laughing

490
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,149
Is the princess returning home?

491
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,218
Go to Wang Kuan's house

492
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:34,819
Wang Kuan

493
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:38,456
At the residence of Wang Bo, who participated in political affairs

494
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:39,424
yes

495
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:03,782
Thousands of miles apart

496
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,252
The erosion of time cannot change it

497
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:35,613
Yanei

498
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:36,981
Yanei

499
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,250
How about it

500
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,052
The government has asked

501
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:42,353
After Wang Kuan went out last night,

502
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:43,188
never came back

503
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:45,857
There's no one in Xiaojing's room either

504
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:49,894
Xiao Xue

505
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:50,895
Good thing

506
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,331
They must have eloped.

507
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:55,467
impossible

508
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:56,968
We still have to save Yuan Zhongxin

509
00:28:58,970 --> 00:28:59,738
What about that person?

510
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,507
This is the city of Kaifeng

511
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:03,975
How can people disappear like this?

512
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,177
two persons

513
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:07,312
Princess Zhao is here

514
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:14,419
Chief

515
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,654
last night

516
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:17,956
We're going to find you, you know?

517
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:21,693
I know

518
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:23,661
Then why don't you see us?

519
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,296
Is there anything to eat?

520
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:53,191
anything else

521
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:55,393
Slowly, slowly, slowly

522
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:57,228
Haven't eaten for a long time

523
00:29:57,228 --> 00:29:58,630
Not good to eat too eagerly

524
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,165
Haven't eaten recently

525
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:01,699
I have no appetite for the wake.

526
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:05,069
The cook of the Wang family

527
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:06,471
nice

528
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:09,174
The consistency of this porridge is just right

529
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:11,075
He really has a hand

530
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:11,910
Their bamboo shoot meat sandwich

531
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,211
The marrow cake is amazingly made

532
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:15,113
I was so full last night

533
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:15,647
Yeah

534
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,581
I'll try it later too

535
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,049
Said it was the cook

536
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:19,651
Vegetarian meat sandwich is better

537
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:20,985
Better than minced meat

538
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:22,754
There must be mushrooms inside.

539
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,255
mushroom

540
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:25,423
Talk about something serious

541
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:27,659
right

542
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:29,861
I was confused when I saw you eating porridge.

543
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:30,495
Chief

544
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:31,796
I have something to tell you

545
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:32,497
Just right

546
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,698
I also have something to tell you

547
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,034
Then you first

548
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:41,406
Yuan Zhongxin asked and beheaded three days later

549
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:46,978
Where is Wang Kuan?

550
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:47,545
call him over

551
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:48,613
Discuss it together

552
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:49,848
that's what i want to say

553
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:51,616
Wang Kuan is missing

554
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,051
Even with Xiao Jing

555
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:54,419
Why is it missing?

556
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:56,154
Wang Kuan went to Xiao Jing's house last night

557
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:57,288
Never came back again

558
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:04,062
Walk

559
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:04,996
where to

560
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,165
Didn’t you say you were going to Xiao Jing’s house?

561
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:08,533
Go and have a look

562
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:18,376
Let me tell you

563
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:19,544
this money

564
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:20,612
Be sure to watch it carefully

565
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,246
I know

566
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:23,214
That person

567
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:24,415
Unreliable

568
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,184
This is it

569
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:27,385
how do you know

570
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,586
Where is Xiaojing’s house?

571
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,288
When I lived in Secret Pavilion before,

572
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:31,556
I live in the same room with Xiao Jing

573
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,057
She mentioned it during chatting

574
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:34,425
You will remember this

575
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:35,860
is it hard

576
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:38,663
Why is there always someone in her house?

577
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:39,664
in and out

578
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,699
Not far from here is Jieshen Alley

579
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:42,934
A lot of gold, silver and silk

580
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:43,835
trading place

581
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,236
The Pei family has lived here for a long time

582
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,537
I know many shopkeepers

583
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:47,605
follow their path

584
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:48,873
Can deposit and withdraw gold and silver

585
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:50,742
This kind of method is needed to deposit and withdraw gold and silver.

586
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:52,844
There are thousands of transactions like this

587
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:55,046
Need to find a reliable dentist

588
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:55,847
Pei's family left

589
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:57,215
This is the way to introduce it

590
00:31:57,615 --> 00:31:58,549
I know this

591
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:01,219
Gold and silver prices fluctuate

592
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,754
If one fails, everything will go bankrupt.

593
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,656
If there is no reliable matchmaker,

594
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:06,524
Who trusts strangers trading?

595
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,426
you know too

596
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:09,794
Played before

597
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:11,095
Still making money

598
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:11,996
Then what

599
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:13,231
Then

600
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,766
I discovered that a young lady is worth more than gold and silver.

601
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:15,333
interesting

602
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,301
I won't play anymore.

603
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:25,877
What's wrong

604
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:30,848
Lu Nanshan said

605
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:32,417
Yuan Zhongxin ran out once

606
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:33,551
I asked you to hand it back

607
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:36,354
Everyone said it was impossible

608
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,188
This must happen

609
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:38,356
Are you still thinking about saving people?

610
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:40,725
That's true

611
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,093
it is true

612
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:45,663
This is also what Yuan Zhongxin meant

613
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:46,631
You discussed it

614
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:49,867
That's right

615
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:51,302
scared me

616
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:53,104
Don't you say it's fake?

617
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:54,505
If you lose, you'll have to twist your head off.

618
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:56,074
There's a secret behind this

619
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,508
Besides, why do you want my head?

620
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:58,710
Don't you say collection?

621
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,311
Can't you collect some good things?

622
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:01,713
you said it

623
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,392
There should be no one inside now

624
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:16,260
Then let’s go in and ask now.

625
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,128
Wang Kuan’s whereabouts

626
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,030
In case this goes missing

627
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,031
Is it related to them?

628
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:20,765
Ask honestly

629
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:21,699
There may not be any results

630
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,035
What should I do?

631
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:30,341
To ask

632
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,943
Just ask a little more boldly

633
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:52,030
Did I tell you?

634
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,164
Look left and right

635
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:54,298
Don't let anyone in

636
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:57,468
Why are you still pretending?

637
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:58,469
Robbing a house

638
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:00,104
It's so easy to tell the truth

639
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:02,974
That's not the only way, right?

640
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:04,308
Xiao Jing was taken by the Pei family

641
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:05,410
Sold to the owner

642
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,210
do you know

643
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:10,214
Do not worry

644
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,349
I'm just scared

645
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:12,116
Be sensible

646
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:13,851
Chief

647
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,353
Let me tell the truth

648
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:17,555
Since you met Yuan Zhongxin

649
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,690
There isn't much of a thing like proportion left.

650
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:23,694
Don't blame the chief

651
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:24,996
Blame Yuan Zhongxin

652
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,175
Hero Rong Zhen

653
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:39,343
Our family is really poor

654
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:40,545
Really no money

655
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:41,212
yes

656
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,447
Who are you lying to?

657
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:43,981
Don’t hide it from this big brother

658
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:45,583
Really short of money

659
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,218
but

660
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:48,953
Brother, you can’t come here in vain

661
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,354
There is a bowl of chicken soup on the table

662
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:52,490
For you, drink chicken soup first

663
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:00,298
or

664
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:01,833
I'll heat it up for you again

665
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:02,967
less nonsense

666
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:05,837
Do you think I am a hero?

667
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:07,105
I came to rob your house.

668
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:08,873
What else?

669
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,342
Did the hero go to the wrong door?

670
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:14,612
This hero sneaked into Kaifeng

671
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,547
Naturally, I want to make a big pen

672
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:19,117
Guess who I'm eyeing?

673
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:23,588
The son of Wang Bo, who was involved in political affairs

674
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,089
The one named Wang Kuan

675
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:26,224
You know?

676
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:32,263
Someone saw it last night

677
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:33,831
He came to your house

678
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:35,266
Never went out again

679
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:37,335
Say it

680
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:39,237
where are people

681
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,304
Hero

682
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,073
People did come

683
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:43,407
Left soon

684
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:45,943
Really gone

685
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:46,978
Didn’t drink much tea

686
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:47,411
yes

687
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,285
Why did my men say they didn't leave?

688
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:55,853
Hero

689
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:58,456
What if your men missed it?

690
00:35:58,456 --> 00:35:59,090
yes

691
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:06,430
Hero, please

692
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,465
Don't touch my son

693
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,333
If you want to kill me, then kill me.

694
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,334
Where is Wang Kuan?

695
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,936
He, he's gone

696
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:12,970
He really left

697
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:14,539
I dare not lie

698
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:15,940
The hero knows clearly

699
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,741
He really left

700
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,409
Our yard is so big

701
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:19,177
Do not believe

702
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,112
Hero, you can search it

703
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:22,113
Where have you gone?

704
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:24,015
Where has he been?

705
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:26,350
No

706
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:28,352
Definitely

707
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:30,421
Back home

708
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:33,524
Yes, yes, he is home

709
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:36,928
So Wang Kuan and Xiao Jing have been here

710
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:38,196
But left again

711
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,933
From here to Wang's house

712
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:43,067
People are just gone

713
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:45,236
Chief, it's just like you said

714
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:45,970
They treat their own sons

715
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:46,804
attach great importance to

716
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:48,206
Doesn't look like he's lying

717
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:49,607
I was thinking

718
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:51,209
There may be something wrong with the Pei family

719
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:52,343
if not

720
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:53,211
That would be difficult

721
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:54,579
Xue Ying

722
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,247
The Wang family is concerned about this matter

723
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:57,448
How do you plan to deal with it?

724
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,317
They didn't panic

725
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:00,685
Talk about Wang Kuan’s recent years

726
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:01,586
Never return home

727
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:02,587
Already used to it

728
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,188
I was still thinking about it

729
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:05,590
Borrowing the Wang family’s connections

730
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,591
Ask about Yuan Zhongxin

731
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:08,092
the exact place of execution

732
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:09,860
So what should we do now?

733
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:11,929
Now we can only wait for Yuan Zhongxin

734
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:13,030
Post your own message

735
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,832
Why did Yuan Zhongxin release the news?

736
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:15,733
Isn't he in jail?

737
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:18,169
last night

738
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:19,337
why don't i see you

739
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:21,706
Yes why

740
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:24,175
Because this matter of the Yuan family is very involved

741
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:26,110
I was thinking of finding a way on my own

742
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,345
Don't drag you into the water

743
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:28,713
Can you understand?

744
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:29,347
understand

745
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,084
But now Yuan Zhongxin said

746
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,285
let me find you

747
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:35,553
Let's help rob the prison together

748
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:36,621
Can you understand?

749
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:37,288
clear

750
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:41,993
I also understood

751
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:44,462
You don't understand

752
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,298
All the classes in the Secret Pavilion were in vain.

753
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:48,699
Think about it yourself

754
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:49,567
As a lesson

755
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:51,535
The secret pavilion is gone

756
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:53,170
Why do you still have homework?

757
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,572
Let's go to my house first

758
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:57,208
What do you unserstand

759
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:58,209
No need to understand

760
00:37:58,509 --> 00:37:59,410
Listen to the chief

761
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:00,578
That's okay too

762
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,063
sit

763
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:42,987
This house is

764
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:43,788
I live

765
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:47,825
Chief

766
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,828
You have so many hobbies?

767
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:52,430
When I was young, I was brave

768
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,464
Want to learn everything

769
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:55,333
Forget about hobbies for now

770
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,834
What should the chief do now?

771
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,235
Wang Kuan and Xiao Jing are gone

772
00:38:58,235 --> 00:38:59,103
Where was Yuan Zhongxin executed?

773
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:00,104
No whereabouts either

774
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:00,805
How to save people

775
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,073
Asking others is better than asking yourself

776
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:02,707
What's the meaning

777
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:04,542
Right now we do

778
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:05,876
Encountered some setbacks

779
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:06,844
But it doesn't matter

780
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:08,446
Yuan Zhongxin can save himself

781
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:12,316
You guys sit down first

782
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:16,887
I'll get you a pot of hot tea

783
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:28,499
Self-help

784
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:30,034
How to save yourself

785
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,302
Don't be nervous

786
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:33,104
take it easy

787
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,872
Yuan Zhongxin's side was heavily guarded.

788
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:35,740
locked in dungeon

789
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,574
How can he save himself?

790
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:37,308
I do not know

791
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:37,975
Aren't you panicked?

792
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,911
Yuan Zhongxin's accident

793
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:42,446
Who is the most nervous?

794
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:45,950
The chief is calm

795
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:47,952
It shows that things can turn around.

796
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:49,754
I don't know what the turnaround is.

797
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:51,355
But I believe in the chief

798
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:52,556
I also believe Yuan Zhongxin

799
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:53,824
this is trust

800
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:55,226
Aren’t you just breaking the pot?

801
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:57,194
What are you talking about?

802
00:39:58,028 --> 00:39:59,296
What do you mean?

803
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:01,332
Didn't you understand?

804
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:02,433
what am i talking about

805
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,068
If there's nothing wrong with my ears

806
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:05,569
You asked me to find Zhao Jian

807
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,804
Give me the time and place of your execution

808
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:07,538
Tell her everything

809
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:08,706
yes

810
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:11,575
Are you crazy

811
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:13,511
What is my relationship with you?

812
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:14,712
What is your relationship with me?

813
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:16,347
Blood feud

814
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:19,250
My colleague died tragically and his blood has not been avenged.

815
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:20,851
It’s all thanks to your Yuan family

816
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,789
That's what my dad did

817
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:26,257
I don't know

818
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,124
good

819
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:28,926
Even if it has nothing to do with you

820
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,728
The most I can do is not kill you with my own hands

821
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:32,496
How could I help save you?

822
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:33,964
You are so brave

823
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:34,865
It's absolutely impossible for me

824
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:35,499
Need not

825
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,501
No need for you to do anything

826
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:39,737
Just spread the news

827
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:40,871
Why

828
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:43,507
you want revenge

829
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:44,775
right

830
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:45,876
nonsense

831
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,344
What if I die?

832
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:48,512
The clue is broken

833
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,147
The Yuan family can't be found

834
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:51,582
How to avenge

835
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,785
Can I take revenge if you don’t die?

836
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:55,486
Of course

837
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:56,454
Why

838
00:40:58,189 --> 00:40:59,089
Xiaoyuan

839
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:01,659
Think about it

840
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,328
who is my father

841
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:07,698
Former Landlord

842
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:09,900
So what do you think if I get caught?

843
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:11,735
Will he come to save me?

844
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,606
Since they are father and son, they must be saved.

845
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:16,974
Then why am I

846
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:17,908
Being locked up here for so long

847
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:18,776
He didn't even come to save me

848
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:19,977
nonsense

849
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,979
This deep prison is heavily guarded

850
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:22,746
How to save

851
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:23,747
Looking for death

852
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:24,782
What if

853
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:26,217
The time and place of my execution

854
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,151
leaked out

855
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:28,452
He knows

856
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,588
Is it possible to come and save me?

857
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,089
Nonsense

858
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,625
It's possible

859
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:37,795
Then do you think it is one?

860
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:38,996
Good opportunity to catch him

861
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:39,797
but

862
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:41,365
No, but listen to me

863
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:44,969
Tell Zhao Jian the news

864
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:45,703
This thing is equal to

865
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:46,670
leaked

866
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:47,972
right

867
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:48,539
right

868
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:50,307
Then my father

869
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:51,675
It's possible to save me

870
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:52,309
right

871
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:52,810
right

872
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:54,245
You and Mr. Lu

873
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:55,613
Set up an ambush in advance

874
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:56,780
It's possible to catch him

875
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,348
right

876
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,115
Is it right

877
00:41:58,115 --> 00:41:58,782
so

878
00:41:58,983 --> 00:41:59,917
You wait a moment, wait a moment

879
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:00,751
I'll take a look

880
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:01,752
do you want revenge

881
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:02,486
think

882
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:03,954
Then there is no need to stroke it

883
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:06,056
Go directly to Lu Nanshan

884
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:08,292
I teach you

885
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,261
The first thing you say when you see him is

886
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:11,128
Dean

887
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,297
I thought of a clever idea

888
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,432
What do I say, do you still need to teach me?

889
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:20,304
Dean

890
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:22,306
I thought of a clever idea

891
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:24,208
clever plan

892
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:26,777
Former Zhongxin Chingqiqi

893
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:28,045
before killing him

894
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,413
Why not use it as bait

895
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,117
What's the way to make bait?

896
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:35,619
Where we can carry out executions

897
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:36,687
leaked out

898
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:38,422
If the Yuan family wants to save him

899
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:39,890
Must come

900
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,693
We can lay down a dragnet

901
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,431
Then we will set up a dragnet

902
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:49,233
Maybe we can catch the head of the Yuan family

903
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:50,668
you mean

904
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:52,570
The news of Yuan Zhongxin's execution

905
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,337
Let it go

906
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:54,171
no

907
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:56,373
Such an arrangement must be a bad thing

908
00:42:57,942 --> 00:42:59,209
What happened?

909
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:01,545
Because it's too fake

910
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:02,947
Not a big shot

911
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:04,381
Kill someone like me

912
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:06,216
The news spread throughout the city

913
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:07,818
Others will know it's a scam when they see it

914
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:09,219
Because it's too fake

915
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:11,255
He's not a big shot

916
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,756
Kill him for this news

917
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,191
Make it known throughout the city

918
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:15,059
Others look at

919
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:16,460
You will definitely think there is fraud in it

920
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:27,771
So kill me for this news

921
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,574
It must be spread out cleverly

922
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:32,977
So kill me for this news

923
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:34,778
It must be spread out cleverly

924
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:36,213
kill you

925
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:40,651
Kill him

926
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:41,485
Yuan Zhongxin

927
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:42,987
How to do it cleverly?

928
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:46,190
Dean

929
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:47,858
Can be leaked to Zhao Jian

930
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:49,460
Zhao Jian is so bold

931
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,894
I've been thinking about robbing jail all day long

932
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:53,364
We pass the news to her

933
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:55,299
She will be looking for help everywhere

934
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,067
The Yuan family will definitely be involved.

935
00:43:57,434 --> 00:43:58,535
When the time comes, the Yuan family will

936
00:43:58,535 --> 00:43:59,470
Together with Qizhai and the others

937
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,170
lawless

938
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,572
captured together

939
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:02,973
Wouldn't it be better to have the best of both worlds?

940
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:10,714
Dean

941
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:14,885
That's quite logical.

942
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:17,488
Carefully thought about

943
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:20,524
The key now

944
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:22,259
Just let someone tell this news

945
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:23,527
Leaked to Zhao Jian

946
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,996
It's me, of course.
