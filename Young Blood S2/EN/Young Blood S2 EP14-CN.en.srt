1
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,609
The Song Dynasty has been unfavorable in foreign wars in recent years

2
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,111
After all

3
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,580
This is the result of civilians taking charge of the army.

4
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:56,049
You say

5
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,551
Should this situation be changed?

6
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:00,820
Did you kill Liu Sheng?

7
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,690
If there is a chance to save the Song Dynasty from danger,

8
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,258
what are you willing to pay

9
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,626
you admitted it

10
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,095
i am willing to give everything

11
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:13,466
What do you plan to do with him?

12
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:18,671
You mean Lu Nanshan?

13
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:19,973
in his plan

14
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,408
Your life or death is not important

15
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:23,910
so

16
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,213
You want us to kill him

17
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,048
I'm afraid of him

18
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,517
Afraid of Lu Nanshan

19
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,085
Afraid of him killing someone

20
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,453
not just this

21
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:35,989
This person

22
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,658
Always looks calm

23
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:41,294
But in his heart

24
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,596
There is a flame that cannot be hidden

25
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:45,932
Once he has a goal

26
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:48,902
Even if everything is destroyed

27
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,570
I won't hesitate

28
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,973
Even if it's himself

29
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,977
do you understand

30
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,015
Of course I'm afraid of him

31
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,184
Everyone is afraid of crazy people

32
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,086
Then you still follow him?

33
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,488
His Orders

34
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,056
I dare not violate

35
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:12,792
Even every time with him

36
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:13,860
while talking

37
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,495
Have to think twice

38
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:17,964
God knows when

39
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:18,698
he will feel you

40
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,966
blocked his steps

41
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:22,669
As long as you are not careful

42
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,538
Maybe he will die

43
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,610
That's better than Lu Zhangyuan back then.

44
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,011
Even more extreme

45
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:33,980
Can't compare

46
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:36,649
Lu Guannian knew that he

47
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,084
standing in darkness

48
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:39,552
fight for light

49
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,290
And he thinks he is the light

50
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,429
You kill your compatriots

51
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,231
He also said that he was the rescuer

52
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,865
The Song Dynasty was in danger

53
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,669
Only when war breaks out can we save the Song Dynasty

54
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,404
The Song Dynasty was unfavorable in foreign wars

55
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:00,173
More battles are lost than won

56
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:01,274
The more you fight, the more you lose

57
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:02,709
Only officials will gradually understand

58
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,377
It is wrong to let civilians control the army

59
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:06,946
If you lose too much, it will hurt.

60
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:08,615
Only then can we have the opportunity to change the old system

61
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,250
How many people will die

62
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,586
It's worth it to kill someone

63
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,088
Then why don't you die?

64
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,089
if necessary

65
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,090
I can die too

66
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:18,625
But not now

67
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,393
Others can do it now

68
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,365
You all don't understand

69
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,301
Now is the best time

70
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:30,336
After the Liao-Xia War

71
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,871
Liao has been in decline

72
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,740
Although Yuan Hao from Xixia is brave,

73
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,174
But after all, the country is weak

74
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:36,676
How many more games will you lose at this time?

75
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:37,977
Will not shake the overall situation

76
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:38,911
Lose a few games

77
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:40,513
Change the old system

78
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,383
Haven't we lost enough?

79
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,684
Dead people

80
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,587
Anyway, the Song Dynasty has a vast territory

81
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:48,888
There are always enough people

82
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,524
Let them die a worthy death

83
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:52,925
Is it not good

84
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:54,394
Liao is in decline

85
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,595
Xixia's national power was weak

86
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:56,296
In this situation

87
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,664
Are they willing to fight?

88
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,565
You are wishful thinking

89
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:00,667
Planning here

90
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,102
All we get in return is a loss of life.

91
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:06,372
warmongers

92
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:07,974
There is always

93
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,976
Yuan Hao is warlike

94
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,179
So you don’t want to kill Yuan Hao at all

95
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:14,647
As early as in Helan Mountain

96
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,549
You concealed Yuan Hao’s combat power

97
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,017
Prevent the Yuzhou Army from rescuing

98
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:20,219
Birds are not exhausted, bows are not hidden

99
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:24,457
Let me ask you another question

100
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,491
why do you think that

101
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,492
Kill Yuantian Pass

102
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,130
Inconvenient to say

103
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,299
Let Yuan Zhongxin ask me

104
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:34,734
Why Yuan Zhongxin

105
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,307
I know

106
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,010
You have a lot to ask

107
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,546
but i can't hear

108
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,314
It doesn't matter

109
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:51,084
I'll try to answer first

110
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:53,886
You came to Tanzhou

111
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,990
Have you seen these disasters?

112
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:03,096
So are these things real?

113
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,131
of course not

114
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,867
In this world there is no

115
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:09,936
Diseases of the world

116
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,204
What is the disease in the world?

117
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,276
Godless Demon

118
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:20,146
Since there are no gods and demons

119
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,548
Why slay demons?

120
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,016
Yuan Zhongxin

121
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:26,386
You know I'm Da Song

122
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:29,889
How to deal with world disasters?

123
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,491
sue for disaster

124
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,993
It doesn't matter if you don't know

125
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,028
I tell you

126
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:39,465
In the Song Dynasty, we implemented the system of suing for disasters

127
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,300
Each state

128
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,903
If there are disaster victims reporting the disaster

129
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:48,708
Affected people reported the disaster to the government

130
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:53,813
The county official verified the disaster situation and reported it to the state official

131
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:57,450
Report to the court after re-examination

132
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,086
To determine relief strategies

133
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,488
I won’t go into details about these.

134
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,991
You probably don’t like to hear it either

135
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:05,825
Do I like to hear it?

136
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,059
You said it very carefully too.

137
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,095
these past few years

138
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:13,366
Jinghu South Road suffers from drought and floods

139
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:16,769
But the victims who reported the disaster

140
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,273
but

141
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:26,379
Far less than the number of people affected by the disaster

142
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:28,247
Why

143
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:33,352
Because they believe this

144
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:40,026
Real Buddhist temple

145
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,395
Whenever disaster strikes

146
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,764
Money and food will always be distributed

147
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,365
Compensate the people

148
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,769
And the people behind these disasters

149
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,805
But let the people think

150
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:55,575
The disaster is caused by strange things

151
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,811
It's God's punishment

152
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,947
It's a punishment from gods and demons

153
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:05,418
Disaster victims apologize to clay statues

154
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,654
But unwilling to report the disaster

155
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:09,689
think

156
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,224
This is God's will

157
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,259
Can't disobey

158
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:14,594
so

159
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,896
I'm going to set up a puzzle

160
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,065
looking for me

161
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,133
Like-minded students

162
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,369
what we have to do

163
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:26,272
Just to let the world understand

164
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:30,476
Disasters are natural disasters, not man-made disasters

165
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:34,013
Let the world no longer be afraid of clay statues

166
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,749
Only follow the law and human feelings

167
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,819
This is slaying demons

168
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:46,025
Many people are loyal to their country

169
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,427
Some are on the battlefield

170
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,496
Some in the court

171
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,566
They do big things

172
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,301
and I

173
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,704
I can only do this little thing

174
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,707
Let there be no superstition in the world

175
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:05,011
Let people in the world encounter disasters

176
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,213
can be rescued

177
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,715
Can trust the court

178
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,384
This is no small matter

179
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,987
There are so many disaster legends

180
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:17,223
Fight these superstitions

181
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,091
It's really difficult

182
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,260
We study disasters

183
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,896
Again in a disaster place

184
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,732
Destroy the so-called idols

185
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,467
Tell the people

186
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,970
These are all fake

187
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:32,505
And after that

188
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:36,375
I became the target of public criticism

189
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:40,513
Various families under the rule of Xiangning County

190
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:44,483
Using superstitious sacrifices as a way to make money

191
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:47,353
Let the villagers believe in gods and demons

192
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,055
Make money by taking advantage of disaster

193
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,457
The man from the academy, He County Cheng

194
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:54,460
share their interests

195
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,063
No wonder the government wants to arrest you

196
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,031
Natural disasters hurt people

197
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,233
People suffer

198
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,770
But was defrauded of money by scammers

199
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,273
deceive superiors and deceive inferiors

200
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,208
extortionate taxes

201
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,745
And the government and those liars

202
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,715
But he gets fat by sucking blood

203
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,183
This doesn't change

204
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,885
How should people live?

205
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:21,687
So you exorcise the demon

206
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,223
moved their interests

207
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:25,324
Yuan Zhongxin

208
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,593
You came to Tanzhou

209
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,261
I am very happy

210
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:32,565
Because I also want to see you

211
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:33,366
Why

212
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,501
because i'm sick

213
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,069
I'm old

214
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,105
I have to follow these

215
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,906
Read what is written

216
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:42,141
because every year

217
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,944
My memory is fading

218
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,747
Don’t write down a lot of things

219
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,450
I can't remember

220
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,388
I want to see you

221
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:59,992
Because I know I'm dying

222
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,062
But I am not afraid of death or aging

223
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,498
Not afraid of being caught by them

224
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,166
But I'm afraid of

225
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,669
Things that persist until now

226
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,470
die from then on

227
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,539
Nothing more

228
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:27,953
Yuan Zhongxin

229
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,023
i see you

230
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,293
it's actually really easy

231
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,212
I hope you inherit my mantle

232
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:55,715
become this world

233
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,617
New Demon Slayer

234
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:17,970
Yuan Zhongxin

235
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:35,087
where have you been

236
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:37,389
No matter how we look for you, we can't find you

237
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:39,725
Who rescued you?

238
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:43,229
Brother Yuan

239
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:44,663
Does it matter if you are injured?

240
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:49,835
I'm back

241
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:54,540
besides

242
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,009
Pollux wants to see you

243
00:12:57,176 --> 00:13:00,179
Exorcism has been in business for many years now

244
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:03,349
Working hard but achieving little results

245
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,951
Destroyed idols

246
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,853
They will rebuild

247
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,156
It often takes several years to pull

248
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,091
Falling short of success

249
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,193
Count every ten villages

250
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:16,829
The one who can finally get rid of inner demons

251
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,098
Maybe just one or two

252
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,233
But these two villages

253
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,135
If there is another natural disaster

254
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,071
There is a possibility of survival

255
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:29,074
With hope of continuation for future generations

256
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,076
Therefore

257
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,980
Even if decades are wasted

258
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,782
Old heart and disabled body

259
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,885
In the end, only one person was saved

260
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,621
Still worth it

261
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,269
But from the hearts of the world

262
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,072
Get rid of fear and ignorance

263
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:03,542
This is better than killing to save others

264
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:04,844
It's a hundred times harder

265
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:06,412
Exorcist

266
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:07,913
So bold

267
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:09,849
struggle in this

268
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,651
Maybe it’s harder than fighting on the battlefield

269
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,754
Fighting with gods and demons, fighting with people

270
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,423
It's quite magnificent

271
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:18,824
Use it for a lifetime

272
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:19,592
To complete a

273
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:20,826
almost impossible

274
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,428
I'm a little excited when I think about it.

275
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:23,329
But if there is no one

276
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,663
If the gods and demons are credible

277
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,965
Facing the vastness of the world

278
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:26,899
Will you be afraid?

279
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:27,933
Maybe

280
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,168
But it's okay

281
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:29,835
Why

282
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:30,870
I believe you

283
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,371
Xinyanei

284
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,773
Everyone who believes in Qizhai

285
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,176
I believe in Brother Wang more

286
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:38,444
You are here

287
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,613
I won't worry and be afraid

288
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,783
Instead of believing in mud and stone statues

289
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,652
It is better to trust people of the same faith

290
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:47,753
Someone you can trust

291
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,588
You can let go of God

292
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,064
Xiao Lu Zhangyuan meets again

293
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,467
I heard you have some problems

294
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,168
Just want to talk to me

295
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:05,371
let her out

296
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,106
Is this necessary?

297
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,174
No problem, I'll go out

298
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:10,709
You guys chat

299
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,845
If you need anything, come to me anytime

300
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:13,812
I was out

301
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:14,947
OK

302
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:22,021
In fact, it doesn’t matter if you follow me

303
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,222
say something

304
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,623
I'll tell her when I turn around

305
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:25,858
So you let her out

306
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:26,892
In fact, it’s unnecessary

307
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,093
That day in jail

308
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,129
Watching you two become united forever

309
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,766
I'm really touched

310
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:35,868
Then you can just give me a gift

311
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:39,171
That's why I let her out

312
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,340
Just to protect you

313
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:43,609
What's the meaning

314
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,210
Zhao Jian asked me just now

315
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,947
Why kill Yuan Tianguan?

316
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:49,915
The answer is simple

317
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:51,650
My father organized spies back then

318
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:52,885
Yuan Tianguan and I

319
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,286
Have cooperated many times

320
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,587
At that time

321
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:57,456
We can talk to your dad quite well.

322
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,125
Birds of a feather

323
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,493
So much so that we recently

324
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:02,594
There is also cooperation

325
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:04,396
So what he knew

326
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:05,264
Too much

327
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,367
Once something is leaked out

328
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,836
You and I

329
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,771
All will be doomed

330
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,673
What does it have to do with me

331
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,008
I don't want Yuan Hao to die

332
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,077
because he will become

333
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,712
The Whetstone of the Song Dynasty

334
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:23,248
so what

335
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:24,216
So when I see

336
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,684
You cooperate with Brother Ning Ling

337
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:26,819
I don't think so

338
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,154
Secretly protecting Yuan Hao

339
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,255
People don't know yet

340
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,724
Very touching

341
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,225
I would rather Lingge cooperate with you

342
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,593
It means the official

343
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,795
I can't stop it

344
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:38,230
so what

345
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:40,833
I can only invite your dad

346
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,635
Do some tricks for me

347
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,270
Do some tricks

348
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:53,545
Figured it out

349
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,248
You don’t want Brother Ning Ling

350
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:57,449
Cooperate with us

351
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,487
You let Yuan Tianguan obstruct it

352
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:02,454
Go on

353
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,127
explain

354
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,429
How did Prince Zhao die?

355
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:13,165
if

356
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:14,867
Zhao Jian knows

357
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,170
His father's death was caused by your father

358
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,373
You little couple

359
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,742
how to face each other

360
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,110
You let Yuan Tian pass

361
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,845
Attack Prince Zhao

362
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,981
I can help you hide it from her

363
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:30,816
you can continue

364
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,484
happy life

365
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,154
The premise is to let me go

366
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:37,256
Just let me go

367
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,191
Let me go

368
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:43,595
Release

369
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,810
You also have to worship this thing

370
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,181
Yuan Zhongxin is like this

371
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,415
disappeared

372
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:05,584
gentlemen

373
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,352
This is the power of the gods

374
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,255
He was rescued.

375
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,725
How can there be gods and demons in this world?

376
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:14,927
impossible

377
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,862
If there were no gods

378
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,530
How could so many people believe it?

379
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:23,902
gentlemen

380
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,572
There is a letter

381
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,107
Dead Ghost Uncle

382
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:29,902
You are Beihexing

383
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,270
Then you sell your own puzzles

384
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,271
He also charged ten cents

385
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:34,072
Is this transaction okay?

386
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,175
People can't hear

387
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,344
I'll also figure out a mystery inside the office later.

388
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:40,546
Make a vote for yourself

389
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,752
Finally met

390
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,453
Everyone, Qizhai

391
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:50,822
Hello Zhao Jian

392
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,193
Those who can be these people

393
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,295
what's up

394
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:57,596
Even the eyes don't work

395
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:04,736
Wei Yuan, your father is still alive

396
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:05,771
Isn't this nonsense?

397
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,773
Your father is now

398
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:10,576
Already joined Yuan Hao's army

399
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,745
Car and gun strategy

400
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,414
in the end

401
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:19,451
Just taking the opportunity to take away your father's authority

402
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,486
Confiscation of property

403
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,356
Your Majesty returns to Xixia

404
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,125
But you insist on killing Yuan Hao

405
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:31,063
How ridiculous it seems

406
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,066
You know that

407
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:37,669
Did he submit to Xixia?

408
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,404
I'll find out the answer myself

409
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,740
do you want to see him

410
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,111
what does it mean

411
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,514
I can give you this chance

412
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,450
You have good intentions

413
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,352
Don't care about money

414
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,454
It’s about the right value for money

415
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,889
I'll lend you a caravan

416
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:02,027
It can reserve funds for the business of eliminating demons

417
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,869
I see you don’t say much usually

418
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,170
Do things at critical times

419
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,171
Quite decisive

420
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:15,207
Want to get rid of Lu Nanshan

421
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,908
This is the only chance

422
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:19,211
We won't kill him

423
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,213
Even if he harmed Liu Sheng

424
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,848
secretly start a war

425
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:24,516
We can't use lynching either

426
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,251
Everything should be punished by national law

427
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:30,055
OK, I understand

428
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,794
we will protect you

429
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,196
Prevent Lu Nanshan from taking revenge

430
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:40,532
thank you

431
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,045
Finished chatting

432
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:55,914
What's wrong

433
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:58,150
What did you say?

434
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,058
I'll go into the house and watch you chat.

435
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:22,774
Dean

436
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:24,176
drink water

437
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:28,180
How could your Pei family survive to this day?

438
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:29,981
It's all my help

439
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:32,984
This is how you repay me

440
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:47,532
Xiaolu Zhangyuan

441
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,234
Let me just ask

442
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:50,869
Qizhai

443
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:52,104
Did you use it

444
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,538
The chess piece that killed Yuantianguan

445
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:55,607
Shouldn’t Yuantianguan be killed?

446
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,477
Actually, I don’t care who you kill.

447
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:00,645
After all, my sister is too

448
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:01,747
A member of Qizhai

449
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:03,849
Again

450
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,085
Our Pei family owes her enough.

451
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,755
What I want to kill is Yuantian Pass

452
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,423
Not Qizhai

453
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,625
After the death of Yuan Tianguan

454
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:15,660
Will Qizhai still be there?

455
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,964
They know a lot

456
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:21,633
That

457
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:24,536
It's really to protect your sister.

458
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:26,538
connected by blood

459
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:28,206
Pei Xuan

460
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:31,543
Ask yourself well

461
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,212
Is it a sister-brother relationship?

462
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,648
Or make excuses to protect yourself?

463
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,218
No conflict

464
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:41,787
All a little bit

465
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,656
The wound is not healed yet

466
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:46,091
Just stop moving

467
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,193
Look at the wound on your back

468
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:49,327
All cracked

469
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,341
Don't be too entangled

470
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,944
What Lu Nanshan told you

471
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:07,979
If you don't want to say it, don't say it

472
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,182
You can solve it yourself too

473
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:12,083
I trust you

474
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:19,324
He asked Yuan Tianguan to attack your father

475
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:26,965
My dad

476
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,969
Didn't he die of a sudden illness?

477
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:41,546
Dean

478
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,448
If you are thirsty and hungry

479
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:44,749
Just tell me

480
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:49,454
The president is a man who does great things.

481
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:51,857
You still have to love your body

482
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:58,230
This clothes is dirty

483
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:00,098
Let me dust you off

484
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:20,552
How did my father die?

485
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:26,224
Yuan Zhongxin

486
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,094
I thought you were a smart person

487
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,296
Wang Kuan will not lie

488
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:32,430
You don't have this problem

489
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,532
You can make up any reason

490
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:34,766
Wouldn't it be over if you lied to her?

491
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:35,300
If I were

492
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,434
Lying about this kind of thing

493
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:38,436
I'm ruined as a person

494
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,971
What are you asking for?

495
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,207
How did my father die?

496
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:43,775
Me and your dad

497
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:45,844
no grudge

498
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:48,113
But Yuan Hao cannot die

499
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,614
If there is no war

500
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,552
Our Song Dynasty has no chance to change the old system

501
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,892
He's been lying to us all this time

502
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,194
I just thought about it

503
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:38,930
My dad's business

504
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,432
Maybe it's just his family's opinion.

505
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:41,566
Not necessarily credible

506
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:44,836
Yuantian Pass is located in Yuelu Mountain

507
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:47,305
We can ask him face to face

508
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:49,007
Zhao Jian

509
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:51,309
If you ask him face to face now

510
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:52,410
He will definitely kill you

511
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:55,013
we can cooperate

512
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:57,248
We are at Yuelu Mountain

513
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:58,717
Kill Yuan Tianguan

514
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:00,819
Your surname is also Zhao

515
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,787
Also of royal blood

516
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,523
Kill the national traitors for our great Song Dynasty

517
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:08,493
Why do you want to kill him so much?

518
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,528
My cooperation with Yuan Tianguan

519
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:11,896
If it is spread

520
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:14,065
My future in the Privy Council

521
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:14,699
That's it

522
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:21,673
But I can't finish

523
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,775
I have to keep living

524
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:25,010
I have to keep walking

525
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,044
Because that's the only way

526
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:27,712
Only then can I have more opportunities

527
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:29,781
Save the Song Dynasty from danger

528
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:32,784
You've ended up in this situation

529
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:34,653
Still want me to help you

530
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:35,787
Zhao Jian is not helping me

531
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:37,055
It’s to help Da Song

532
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:39,924
Decisions should be made in order to achieve great things

533
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:41,660
Really disgusting

534
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:42,661
Zhao Jian

535
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:44,129
This is righteousness

536
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,432
What a big fool you are

537
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,169
I don’t need you to give me a chance

538
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:52,671
I will go to Xixia by myself

539
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:54,372
So you refused

540
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:55,707
Not really.

541
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:58,309
I can agree to take charge of the caravan.

542
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:02,514
Because of what Polaris did

543
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:03,948
A bit admirable

544
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,417
Then say you agree

545
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:06,785
That's not the case.

546
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:08,787
What do you want?

547
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:10,889
Do you agree or not in the end?

548
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,190
It depends on other people's decisions

549
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:13,725
Our Qizhai

550
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,126
Always inseparable from life to death

551
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:25,770
Xue Ying

552
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:30,075
You are the most powerful among Qizhai

553
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:32,310
But it's not enough

554
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:35,914
I will find you a good teacher

555
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,550
Take you to the next level

556
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,785
This teacher is me

557
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:43,388
I will teach you these three years

558
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,823
Why should he read the letter?

559
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,591
Can't you just say no?

560
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:48,193
he

561
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:49,994
Can't remember

562
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:03,775
I'll ask him now

563
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,245
Find the Northern Star

564
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:09,314
Deal with Yuantianguan

565
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,715
If you really take action

566
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:12,016
You and I are not enough

567
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,654
I can't fight.

568
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:17,956
Didn't let you fight

569
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:19,657
Watch him for us

570
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:21,426
This is no problem

571
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,577
Do they just believe you?

572
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:40,545
these days

573
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:42,580
Who can trust whom?

574
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:51,189
Pei Xuan

575
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,292
As long as you let me go now

576
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:57,295
I, Lu Nanshan, swear to God

577
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:00,265
You will definitely know how to do it in officialdom

578
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:01,366
rise to prominence

579
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:03,034
Your Pei family

580
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:05,537
He will surely make great progress

581
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:08,773
This thing of oath

582
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,175
I don't believe you

583
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:11,309
Then what do you believe?

584
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:12,811
Of course I believe you

585
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:14,646
Dean

586
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:16,314
You and I have been together long enough

587
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,049
your temperament

588
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:19,417
I know all

589
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,419
I betrayed you

590
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:23,655
You will definitely kill me

591
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:25,423
I

592
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:26,825
I can change

593
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,694
Hard to change nature

594
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:37,669
What is this for?

595
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,171
Let him eat something when he is tired

596
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:42,173
I'll finish reading it for him.

597
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:44,008
Next is to write to

598
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,476
Wang Kuan and Pei Jing's

599
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:47,245
The meaning is very simple

600
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,646
I won’t recite it accordingly.

601
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,015
Pollux is sorry

602
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,483
Wang Kuan Pei Jing

603
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,786
Because you never grow up

604
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,058
What does it mean not to grow up?

605
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:04,495
Those who enter the secret pavilion must protect the Song Dynasty

606
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:05,196
we have always been

607
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,064
That's what you did

608
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,165
Then you know

609
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,766
What does sacrifice mean?

610
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,668
Sacrificial animals

611
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:13,304
The word "sacrifice" has been around since Zhou Dynasty

612
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:16,374
What about this moment?

613
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:18,309
Want to kill the cow

614
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,511
have you ever thought about

615
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:21,779
offer yourself as a sacrifice

616
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,148
In exchange for the peace of the Song Dynasty

617
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:25,817
human sacrifice

618
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:26,784
yes

619
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:29,354
This offering is a trade-off

620
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,056
Are you willing to serve the Song Dynasty?

621
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,291
What to give up?

622
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:38,463
He deafened his ears

623
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:39,964
Give up fine clothes and food

624
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:41,666
Just to get rid of demons

625
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,301
This is what it means

626
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:44,969
We go deep into Xixia

627
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:45,937
Assassination of Yuan Hao

628
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:47,105
A narrow escape

629
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,107
Wang Kuan has a bright future

630
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:49,941
He let go

631
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:51,576
This is not called giving up

632
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:52,577
What is abandonment

633
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,344
what is this called

634
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,580
This is called willfulness

635
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:56,714
he was thinking

636
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:57,515
Can follow Qizhai

637
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:58,716
With Pei Jing

638
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:00,285
Give up everything and never look back

639
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:02,220
This is to satisfy oneself

640
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,221
brotherhood

641
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,455
Children's affair

642
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:05,590
Wang Kuan

643
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,125
You gave up your future

644
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,259
With Pei Jing

645
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,595
Have you ever felt wronged?

646
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:12,063
Never

647
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:15,967
What is this called giving up?

648
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:18,269
baffling

649
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:22,473
if not

650
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:23,908
Must be separated

651
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,376
Why do you feel so wronged?

652
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:27,445
The famous Wang family

653
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,980
He could have skyrocketed

654
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,014
But he gave up

655
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:31,816
Why should he give up?

656
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:34,419
The Song Dynasty was in turmoil

657
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:35,286
People's suffering

658
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:36,788
He could have used the power of the Wang family

659
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,789
Become a marquis and a prime minister

660
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:38,823
If there is such a day

661
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,024
He can do it for the world

662
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:41,125
How much to do

663
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:44,128
Wang Kuan

664
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,964
So you have to give up Pei Jing

665
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,165
Return to Kaifeng

666
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,067
Admit your mistake to your father

667
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:50,335
according to his wishes

668
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:51,970
Marry a well-matched person

669
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,671
A woman I have never met

670
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:54,505
as wife

671
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:56,674
Depressed ever since

672
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:57,976
Unable to love

673
00:32:58,776 --> 00:32:59,844
You have to give up your love

674
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:01,579
To find the way to become an official

675
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,381
You have to live for the world

676
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:05,516
This is the trade-off

677
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:10,788
As for

678
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:12,023
Pei Jing

679
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:17,061
Have you ever thought about leaving Wang Kuan?

680
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:19,430
Can you do anything for Da Song?

681
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,166
what is your value

682
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,236
Me and everyone

683
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:27,005
Too far apart

684
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:34,445
Then do you feel at ease?

685
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:35,713
enough

686
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:39,951
Don't get me wrong

687
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:41,652
This is the meaning of Polaris

688
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,087
I just convey

689
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:44,889
He wants us to work for him

690
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:45,990
This is inheritance

691
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:47,058
Also a transaction

692
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:48,026
What to trade

693
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:49,827
Aren’t you going to kill Yuan Hao?

694
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:51,195
That's how he helped us

695
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:54,699
this

696
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,534
is the condition

697
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:11,783
There were spies back then

698
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:14,252
Sneak into Xixia in batches at different times

699
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,888
This roster does exist

700
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,589
In the hands of Pollux

701
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:21,325
Three years later, the task is completed

702
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:22,927
He gave us the booklet

703
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,196
Lurking in enemy country

704
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,064
Keep a roster

705
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,065
Doesn't it leave a clue?

706
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:29,434
The so-called spy's life or death is uncertain

707
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:30,468
Those unilateral

708
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:31,536
people to contact them

709
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,172
Maybe it's also possible to die violently

710
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:36,574
Afraid of the Song Dynasty

711
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,009
forget these people

712
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:38,810
yes

713
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:39,377
if if not

714
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:40,578
If this roster

715
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,181
It is estimated that there are many hidden identities

716
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:44,649
no more chance

717
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:45,550
See the light of day again

718
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,819
Not a handle but a concern

719
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:50,822
As long as this booklet remains

720
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:53,424
Whether you live or die, you can go home

721
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,094
Pollux incognito

722
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,228
Hidden among the people

723
00:34:57,862 --> 00:34:58,596
maybe just for

724
00:34:58,596 --> 00:34:59,730
protect this roster

725
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:02,333
Roster to us

726
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:03,701
That is to say

727
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,103
Three years of hard work

728
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:06,704
There is a chance to make a comeback in Xixia

729
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:11,175
Do you need to make a decision now?

730
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:13,644
You can think about it slowly

731
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,513
I've thought about coming to him at any time.

732
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:44,509
Is it over?

733
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,045
gentlemen

734
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,248
You say

735
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:53,084
Could it be that this stone pillar has a spiritual effect?

736
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:55,653
What else do you believe besides these?

737
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,833
Thank you, Mr. Xinyuan.

738
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:17,408
What's wrong

739
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:19,777
somebody is coming

740
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:41,699
Everyone fled

741
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,702
And delivered it to your door yourself

742
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:47,371
Prince Zhao

743
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:49,941
It was you who killed

744
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,144
What Lu Nanshan said

745
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:54,645
There is such a thing

746
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:57,515
Want to know if I killed him?

747
00:36:58,616 --> 00:36:59,217
Can

748
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:02,086
Promise me a condition

749
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,955
Find the Northern Star

750
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:05,256
henceforth

751
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:08,326
Don’t appear in Xixia territory again

752
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:09,493
Why

753
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:12,430
Killing Yuan Hao is my business alone

754
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,166
Don't need anyone to mess with it

755
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,270
OK

756
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:21,505
I promise you

757
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:24,141
Now

758
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,177
give me answer

759
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:29,380
Did you kill Prince Zhao?

760
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,584
You have no intention of keeping your promise

761
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:34,986
impossible

762
00:37:35,252 --> 00:37:37,021
I'm not that kind of person at all

763
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:37,888
Change the conditions

764
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:41,926
fight with me

765
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:43,628
No matter win or lose

766
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,229
I gave her all the answers

767
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:46,364
OK

768
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:52,436
He is injured

769
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:54,472
I come

770
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:56,474
You are not qualified to negotiate terms

771
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:01,646
Others take action

772
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:04,949
You'll never get the answer

773
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:11,255
fine

774
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:13,090
let me

775
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:42,586
Yuan family

776
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,189
Those who are qualified to fight with me

777
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:48,326
Only your elder brother

778
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:54,131
You can't compare to him

779
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,259
You will never be as good as your big brother

780
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:28,165
know why i

781
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:29,834
Have you never regarded you as my son?

782
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:34,739
I go

783
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,384
If you can choose

784
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,220
I would rather you die

785
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:52,757
Leave your brother

786
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,565
But in the end, you were the one who forced brother to death

787
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:13,177
It was Brother Ning Ling who killed him

788
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:13,911
It's you

789
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,346
It's Brother Ning Ling

790
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:19,583
Why does brother want to die?

791
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,987
That's because he knows

792
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:24,855
own biological father

793
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:25,990
Joining the Western Xia

794
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,258
Loyalty and filial piety are difficult to achieve

795
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,325
He has no way to go

796
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:30,060
He died because of you

797
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:13,571
How could any father do this?

798
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:33,691
enough

799
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:34,825
The match is over

800
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:06,090
No more fighting. No more fighting.

801
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:06,857
do not fight

802
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:10,327
we gave in

803
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:22,473
I lost

804
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:24,909
The match is over

805
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:28,178
give her answer

806
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:34,218
you alone

807
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:35,452
come in with me

808
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:42,993
go

809
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:45,729
go

810
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,310
Chief

811
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:02,846
I'll go alone
