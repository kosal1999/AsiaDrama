Under the Great Song Dynasty

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,320
Hidden internal and external troubles

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,000
So the Song Dynasty won over young people from all over the world

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,519
Establish a secret court

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:14,800
Facing the secret war

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,960
Defend the Song Dynasty

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,440
There are ten rooms in the secret pavilion

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,600
Among them, the seventh fast

10
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,960
especially outstanding

11
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,359
Among the seven fasts

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,480
Lots of talents

13
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:25,399
Have noble character

14
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:27,199
The gentle Yuan Zhongxin

15
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:28,280
Virtuous and virtuous

16
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,199
The frail Zhao Jian

17
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:31,399
Domineering and heroic

18
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:33,039
Wang Kuan, a simple-minded person

19
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:33,640
this

20
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,399
It's your sister-in-law.

21
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,640
You are my uncle

22
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,719
Intelligent and astute

23
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,320
The calm and capable Pei Jing

24
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,679
Why don't you just run forward by yourself?

25
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,600
Yes

26
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,920
Then I have to catch up quickly

27
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,000
If you lose it, you have to pay for it.

28
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,399
Knowledgeable and gifted

29
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,159
Xue Ying, who values ​​harmony

Simple and honest

00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:53,240
Wei Yuan, who is clean and self-possessed

32
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:54,359
Let’s talk about Fengyue

33
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:56,039
Six people gathered together

34
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,280
A close friend

35
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:58,079
Event

36
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,359
Methodical

37
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,600
Be polite and courteous

38
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:02,280
that's all

39
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,240
Try harder

40
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,760
Don't worry, I'm definitely right

41
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:09,439
Dean

42
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,239
Secret Pavilion Teacher vs. Qizhai

43
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,560
Appreciate it very much

44
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,400
Much appreciated

45
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,480
You have been sick for seven days

46
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,079
After the Secret Pavilion was established

47
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,280
Qizhai cooperation

48
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,200
Complete various special tasks

49
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,560
Experience life and death

50
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,959
Solve the mystery

51
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,120
Car and artillery

52
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,760
It's a conspiracy

53
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:27,239
stop

54
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:29,519
Persevering in Qizhai

55
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:30,519
With efforts

56
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,519
Secret Pavilion

57
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,840
Unfortunately disbanded

58
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,640
The Secret Pavilion is broken up

59
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:34,840
Seven days of fasting

60
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,120
However, Qizhai Liuzi

61
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,599
Has not changed its original intention

62
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,239
Always defend the Song Dynasty

63
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,280
stop war

64
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,560
Struggle endlessly

65
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:42,599
Qizhai

66
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,599
All of them once sneaked into the prison camp

67
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,239
While breaking through the chaos

68
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,280
Met someone who called himself

69
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,159
Ding Er's Xixia Secret Agent

70
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:51,400
This person has great respect for Qizhai

71
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,879
Especially for Yuan Zhongxin

72
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,200
The relationship with Zhao Jian

73
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,480
Sincere blessings

74
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,400
No matter how much the price is, I won’t let you

75
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,400
Times have changed

76
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,599
Xixia and Song Dynasty

77
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,959
Peace talks in Pizhou

78
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,879
Just arrived in Pizhou City

79
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,719
They're all here to kill me

80
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,039
If this happens

81
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,000
The Song Dynasty will usher in

82
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,400
decades of peace

83
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,960
Save lives from suffering

84
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,199
Qizhai also went to the place of peace talks

85
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,840
And discovered Ding Er again

86
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,240
This person suddenly came here

87
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,560
I'm afraid it's not simple

88
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,680
Ding Er suddenly changed

89
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,840
Already the Xixia General Mi Qinmu Bei

90
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,159
This person is bent on sabotaging the peace talks

91
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,000
Intention to start another war

92
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,520
Qizhai Tongxin

93
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,400
Taking advantage of internal conflicts in Xixia

94
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:41,560
Finally defeated Mi Qinmu Bei

95
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,840
Put him in jail

96
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,439
where is my dad

97
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,240
I caught him

98
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,560
Let him go

99
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,400
However

100
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,400
Rice poultry and livestock

101
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,960
The reason for capturing Zhao Jian’s father

102
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,120
Your father's life is gone.

103
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,319
Force Zhao Jian

104
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,919
Take him out of jail

105
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,639
Go to Xixia

106
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:57,960
Everyone in Qizhai

107
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,120
Don’t believe Zhao Jian

108
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,719
would make such a choice

109
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,719
So he chased away

110
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:04,960
Take a trip

111
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,159
no matter what the truth is

112
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,680
They are all ready to meet Zhao Jian

113
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,960
shared responsibility

114
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,439
life and death together

115
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,800
Change to normal

116
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,919
of course i do

117
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,039
Walking alone with you

118
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,520
But now the heavy responsibility lies on my shoulders

119
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,919
Can we set off quickly?

120
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,840
Can you find me a horse?

121
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,680
Don't say you let him go

122
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,959
To save my father-in-law

123
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:19,879
this kind of thing

124
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,240
You can't do it

125
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,360
Yuan Zhongxin

126
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,040
The title of father-in-law

127
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,639
How can you use it randomly?

128
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,639
Have a task

129
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,759
Miss Zhao

130
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,120
Such a big deal

131
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,199
Remember to keep it confidential

132
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,279
You wait a moment

133
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,000
I will never forget my brother’s hatred

134
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,120
Do you believe it?

135
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,120
Sooner or later you

136
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,639
One day you will die in my hands

137
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,839
I really don't believe it

138
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,680
How about I sit in the bank?

139
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,920
Let's take a gamble

140
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,639
Okay

141
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,439
Life is a bet

142
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,279
You shouldn't have let me take charge

143
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,560
Why are you staring at me like this?

144
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,639
miss you

145
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:23,839
It's only been a few days since we separated

146
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,800
Just miss me so much

147
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,759
I'm that good

148
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:27,959
Then you still run

149
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:30,920
Miqinmubei proposed

150
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,879
Cooperation with the Song Dynasty

151
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,759
Who agreed?

152
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,879
The Privy Council felt

153
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:36,920
This idea works

154
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,800
How to cooperate

155
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,639
Zhao Jian

156
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,600
Help Ning Lingge

157
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,959
Kill Yuan Hao

158
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,079
It’s okay to kill Yuan Hao

159
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,319
But how can he believe it?

160
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:53,040
Killing Yuan Hao is my heart's wish

161
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,800
only this

162
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,600
I will never lie to you

163
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,279
Why did the Privy Council let you

164
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,199
Send him back to Xixia

165
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,920
My father is in his hands

166
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,959
It's reasonable for me to send him back

167
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,480
Yuan Hao won’t be suspicious either.

168
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,959
Then why don't you tell me

169
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,360
It was my father who was saved.

170
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,319
There is no reason to go with Qizhai

171
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,600
Moreover

172
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,279
Killing Yuan Hao will lead to ten deaths and no life.

173
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,240
Then if you have to die

174
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,240
We didn't die together

175
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,319
What a pity that would be

176
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,439
I don't want to involve you

177
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:28,839
Do you think you can drive me away?

178
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,959
Wang Kuan

179
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,720
Small Scene

180
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,199
They come anyway

181
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,439
Do you need me to get them away?

182
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,600
no

183
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,720
They were holding horses and holding hands

184
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,759
More than just holding horses and holding hands

185
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,560
He also held hands while riding on the road.

186
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,920
Isn't that dangerous?

187
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,639
My equestrian skills are okay

188
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,040
that

189
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,199
Everyone listen to me

190
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,639
I don't believe anything you say

191
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,319
Wang Kuan you

192
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,160
Seven fasts in one

193
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,720
Never give up

194
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,399
Wang Kuan just made a guess

195
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,199
no matter what the reason

196
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,759
You are definitely going to Xixia

197
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,639
Without my skills

198
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,639
How can you do it?

199
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,279
Yanei

200
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:30,879
Yanei

201
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:45,959
Xiao Xue

202
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,519
Your horse is too wild

203
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:48,439
Don't care at all

204
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,839
The handsome image of Benyanei

205
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,160
Yanei

206
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,879
What are you doing

207
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,360
The fall was beyond recognition.

208
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:54,639
Small Scene

209
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,720
What's your expression like?

210
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,160
Doubtful about my handsomeness

211
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,120
No no

212
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:58,839
Yanei

213
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:59,920
You look a bit

214
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,639
Not like you anymore

215
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,199
Men change at their 18th birthday

216
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,839
But still handsome

217
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:05,959
Right Wang Kuan

218
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,519
I don't lie

219
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,279
You are really willing

220
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,199
Is Xiaojing in danger?

221
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,040
unwilling

222
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,519
If it's really a desperate situation

223
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,759
At least I'll fall in front of her

224
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,439
I tried my best

225
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,360
I really can't get rid of it

226
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,319
Seven fasts in one

227
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,519
Never give up

228
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,240
Everyone

229
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,120
the road ahead

230
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,600
Maybe a dead end

231
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,159
Just come with me

232
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,799
Forget about life

233
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,480
I'm really going to die.

234
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,720
Can you not die?

235
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,799
Don't be so cowardly

236
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,320
Let's be lucky

237
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,519
Fight for a living

238
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:11,799
as long as i live

239
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,080
you won't die

240
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,159
Then you must not die

241
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,159
Living towards death

242
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,639
Defeating Xixia

243
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,240
border emergency

244
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:30,879
Liao Lord's Third Army

245
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:32,840
One hundred thousand elite soldiers invade Xixia

246
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,399
Battle of Hequ

247
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,799
Defeated by Yuan Hao

248
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,320
under great defeat

249
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,240
The Lord of Liao almost became a prisoner

250
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,039
Since Yuan Hao became famous

251
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,120
Almost no defeat

252
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,559
Everyone understands

253
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,960
Yuan Hao negotiated peace with the Song Dynasty this time

254
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,720
Just to recharge your batteries

255
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:51,559
He will eventually come back

256
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:58,000
This time we go west

257
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,039
privy council is hope

258
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:00,960
Use Ning Lingge to divide the general trend of Xixia

259
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,000
The court has its own right path and hopes for peace

260
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,360
But seeing the residual scene in front of me

261
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,279
We understand vaguely in our hearts

262
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:10,360
Yuan Hao must die

263
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,399
maybe his death

264
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,399
It cannot eliminate the war in the world

265
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,480
But for the people on the border

266
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,200
gain a bit

267
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,440
Possibility of recuperation

268
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,159
is enough

269
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,120
How nobody ah

270
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:28,000
All escaped

271
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,879
Why escape?

272
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,120
War between Song and Xia

273
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,440
This was a battlefield

274
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:38,159
Now the Song-Xia peace talks have ceased war

275
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,200
Then they can all go home

276
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,440
May not be able to come back

277
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,639
War in mountain towns

278
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:45,960
leave scars

279
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,960
It’s the same with people’s hearts

280
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,320
these scars

281
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,759
Maybe it will never be as good as before

282
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,600
What's wrong

283
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,879
I also had this one when I was a kid

284
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:03,879
My dad asked someone to sew it

285
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,120
Tiger Eats Five Poisonous Animals

286
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:07,320
Seek help to drive away poison and avoid disasters

287
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,240
No one had time to escape

288
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,159
Under the scourge of war

289
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,960
Human life is like grass

290
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,840
I said

291
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:29,399
Let's hurry up

292
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,120
There are people waiting in front

293
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,440
We are not from the same place

294
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,240
Surrounded by hatred and deceit

295
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,399
Threats of killing and fear

296
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:47,759
finally

297
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,960
You will all become like me

298
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:52,399
That won't

299
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,759
No matter how it changes

300
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:55,240
I'm even more handsome than you

301
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,080
Guests come like clouds

302
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:02,519
Just make an appointment here

303
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,159
This Ning Lingge

304
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:05,759
After all, he is the prince of Xixia.

305
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:07,399
Why didn't you lead the army yourself?

306
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,159
Maybe he is weak and incompetent

307
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,399
Failed to take military power

308
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,039
Or maybe

309
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,559
Go deep alone

310
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:14,559
No need for men and horses

311
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:15,919
Come and embolden yourself

312
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,600
This Ning Ling brother is too arrogant.

313
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,840
I'll meet him when I come to the office.

314
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:37,639
minister

315
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,519
Miqinmubei

316
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,240
Welcome His Royal Highness the Crown Prince back to Luan

317
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,000
Your Highness

318
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:50,399
You are finally back

319
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,399
Your Highness

320
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,200
Avoid accidents

321
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:03,759
introduce

322
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,399
this

323
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,120
This is the real Miqinmubei

324
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,840
A rare good general

325
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,399
Please get up quickly

326
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,960
Thank you, Your Highness

327
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,919
He is Miqin Mubei

328
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:16,919
how about you

329
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,360
You are Brother Ning Ling

330
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,000
I didn't mean to lie to you

331
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,399
after all

332
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,240
It was within the Song Dynasty

333
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,639
Identity or something

334
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,440
Still have to be cautious

335
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,840
You personally sneaked into the Song Dynasty

336
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
to be honest

337
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,879
I am safer in the Song Dynasty

338
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:35,519
Your Highness

339
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,519
You are worth a thousand dollars

340
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:39,720
How can you go into danger alone?

341
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,600
I have told you many times

342
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,639
you just don't listen

343
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,879
Am I okay?

344
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,000
It's okay

345
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,840
You let them catch you

346
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,879
At least still alive

347
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:52,759
Your Highness

348
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,919
The Holy Lord does not take advantage of danger but takes advantage of luck

349
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,639
Losing an official

350
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,279
If you are serious, you will lose your throne.

351
00:15:58,879 --> 00:15:59,240
Do you

352
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,600
Have you forgotten all your great things?

353
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:01,759
Yes Yes Yes

354
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:02,919
I understand too

355
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,120
You can no longer take risks alone

356
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,440
Look at your bad temper

357
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,519
Where's my dad?

358
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:14,840
Where's our dad?

359
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,120
Take less advantage

360
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:20,639
Prince Zhao

361
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,159
I'm all here

362
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:22,960
Get the person

363
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,000
Send it to Miss Zhao

364
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,080
take it easy

365
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,440
If you really regret it

366
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,720
Let's mobilize the army

367
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,519
What's wrong

368
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:01,960
Miss Zhao

369
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:05,000
Condolences

370
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:06,720
Condolences

371
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:09,480
Why should I express my condolences?

372
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:11,799
Where's my dad?

373
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,039
Your father passed away

374
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,319
I ask you again

375
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:42,599
Your father passed away

376
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,119
But don't get me wrong

377
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:47,079
My way

378
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,839
We are all together

379
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:51,119
this matter

380
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,680
I was also very sudden

381
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:53,720
cause of death

382
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,000
Death

383
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,200
Where did the disease come from?

384
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,720
What's wrong with your father?

385
00:17:58,359 --> 00:17:59,759
Don’t you know yourself?

386
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:07,640
This illness is too sudden, right?

387
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,799
Could your father be faking his illness?

388
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:10,640
Force you to get married

389
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,480
Will not

390
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,079
Changed Sanbo Langzhong

391
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:14,640
Don't know each other

392
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:16,359
Diagnosed results

393
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:17,359
all the same

394
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,960
My dad is really sick.

395
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,240
I advise you

396
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:25,960
Better put down your weapons

397
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,000
You also know

398
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,599
The Song Dynasty wants to cooperate with His Highness

399
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:32,920
Please put the overall situation first

400
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,119
What a fucking mess for you

401
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:36,839
Who can prove that it was due to illness?

402
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,839
I can prove

403
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:42,200
Who are you

404
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:50,559
Lu Nanshan

405
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,480
You know him

406
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:54,599
He is the son of Master Lu

407
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,599
I was nearby before your father died

408
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,359
There's something wrong with the heart

409
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,079
There is no cure

410
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,880
Where did he die?

411
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,079
Our military camp

412
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,359
Then I want to ask Mr. Lu Zhangyuan

413
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:09,279
Why in the Xixia military camp?

414
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,559
What's this

415
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,240
Privy Council orders

416
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,400
Restart the Secret Chamber

417
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:21,559
Lu was ordered to take over

418
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:25,079
It became the Head of the Secret Pavilion

419
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,680
I have been wandering around Xixia for several days

420
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:30,359
Meet Brother Ning Ling today

421
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:32,200
naturally for

422
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,640
Assassination of Yuan Hao

423
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:35,240
Didn't expect

424
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,880
Really Ning Lingge

425
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:41,319
It turned out that he had already been in Song Dynasty

426
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,039
should be true

427
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,440
Mr. Lu wants to inherit

428
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,119
The legacy of the Master

429
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,279
The secret pavilion created by my late father

430
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:43,599
I never agreed

431
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:45,319
So his legacy

432
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:46,480
I don't want to take it either.

433
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,720
in my hand

434
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,720
will be a

435
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,599
Brand new secret pavilion

436
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:57,119
Xiaolu Zhangyuan is really

437
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,720
Ambitious

438
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,240
My dad is now

439
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:05,079
where are you

440
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:08,240
Into the coffin

441
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,559
Sent back to Beijing

442
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:12,440
Why don't you wait for me

443
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:14,720
You are going to Xixia

444
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,759
Help me kill dad

445
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,079
His parents died and he died for three years

446
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,599
Even if you are an official, you should also be Ding You

447
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:23,319
How to continue

448
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:24,720
The principle of following orders

449
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,480
My Secret Pavilion

450
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,200
Put national affairs first

451
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,720
mourning

452
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,599
Wait until the task is completed

453
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,680
Unreasonable

454
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,160
The so-called New Secret Pavilion

455
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,720
It is to cut off human feelings and cut off common sense

456
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:45,720
No reason to rely on

457
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,960
How different from animals

458
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:50,960
If there is any doubt

459
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:53,079
Can exit the Secret Pavilion

460
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:05,720
Unknown situation

461
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,319
Your Highness

462
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,279
you go first

463
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,519
I made an appointment

464
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:42,440
coming

465
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:45,880
Your Highness

466
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,839
Very good

467
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,359
Everyone is here

468
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,559
Let me introduce it first

469
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:04,160
Song Dynasty

470
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,480
Want to kill my father

471
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:10,200
Xiaren

472
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,240
I also want to kill my father

473
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:15,799
Everyone say hello to each other

474
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,640
You actually cooperated with Song Ren

475
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,920
sincerely

476
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,799
Lessons from the sun

477
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,240
How to plan

478
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,559
Wait a minute

479
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,680
Let me ask first

480
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:38,759
Killing my father

481
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:41,079
Are you still participating?

482
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:43,079
Why did you choose me to assassinate?

483
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,039
There are two reasons

484
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:47,960
One

485
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,079
It's me who is in your hands

486
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,240
I have to save myself

487
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:54,240
two one

488
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,240
you have to ask him

489
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,880
He chose you

490
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:01,359
You are not the only one who chose

491
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:04,240
But the entire Qizhai

492
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,039
Why Qizhai

493
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:08,319
Now there is no one available in the Secret Pavilion

494
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,400
How many other fasts are there?

495
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,720
All scattered

496
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,599
some

497
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:15,680
Act according to old orders

498
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,680
elusive

499
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,279
some

500
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,319
disappear without a trace

501
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:19,319
No trace

502
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:20,880
There are more

503
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:23,960
Already completely wiped out

504
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,480
Can be mobilized now

505
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:30,319
It’s just you Qizhai

506
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,519
So

507
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,359
Let’s talk about the plan first

508
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,519
Everyone

509
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:42,720
look there

510
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,079
What to see

511
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:47,400
Pillar

512
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:51,640
There seems to be a flying insect

513
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:55,440
In this direction

514
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,160
Keep going forward

515
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,960
Keep moving forward

516
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,400
there is a holy mountain

517
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,039
its name

518
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:12,960
called Helan Mountain

519
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:29,880
This is crying

520
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,440
see holy mountain

521
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:34,279
Moved

522
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:35,720
Can't see

523
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,319
I saw it in my heart

524
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,039
How long has your highness been sick?

525
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:41,759
You are sick.

526
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:44,400
My Highness, this is the true nature of your heart

527
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:48,480
Your Highness

528
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,200
Let’s get down to business

529
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,799
Do you know

530
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,400
Helan Mountain

531
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,559
Why is it called

532
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,680
The first of the three mountains of Daxia

533
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,400
sacred mountain

534
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,720
Because the party members believe

535
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,960
After death, the soul will eventually return to Helan

536
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,359
The legendary soul of Dangxiang’s ancestor

537
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:17,119
Still on Helan Mountain

538
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:17,880
That's right

539
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:20,480
Even if you die in a foreign country

540
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:21,400
family

541
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,519
I will also go to Helan Mountain to offer sacrifices.

542
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:24,759
So the whole mountain

543
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:26,039
It is a place of sacrifice

544
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:28,960
Helan Mountain

545
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:31,160
It records my Daxia lineage

546
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,240
All hopes and inheritance

547
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:35,920
It is the beginning of all

548
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:39,000
It's also the end of everything

549
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,640
That is why

550
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:43,960
Yuan Hao will rush to Helan

551
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,160
for calendar years

552
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,119
in the war

553
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:47,920
Sacrifice to the Lost Xia People

554
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:49,799
on the holy mountain

555
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,519
Let the dead find peace

556
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:56,440
This is the best time to kill him

557
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,039
When did Yuan Hao go to Helan Mountain?

558
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,599
enough time

559
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,920
You must arrive first

560
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,279
How many soldiers and horses are around him?

561
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,599
The elite left wing army is responsible for escorting

562
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:06,759
besides

563
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:09,400
Guarding the Helan Festival

564
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,559
And me, Daxia

565
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:11,839
Youzhou Military Supervision Department

566
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,119
Headquarters troops

567
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:14,119
That's not easy to do

568
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,839
introduce

569
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,000
this

570
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,880
It’s the Commander-in-Chief of the Military Supervisory Department of Youzhou

571
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:22,680
Liang Gewei's daughter

572
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,039
daughter

573
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,200
daughter

574
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,519
I am Liang Maixiang

575
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:32,640
Youzhou Shaodu commanded the army

576
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,960
Youzhou Military Supervision Department responded

577
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,200
I dispatch from it

578
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:38,720
You all start to assassinate

579
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,319
You can do it yourself

580
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,240
Why do you need us to help you?

581
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,359
My father is the Lord of Daxia

582
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:46,519
I'll start here

583
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:47,599
It won't end well later

584
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,880
Sandpipers and clams fighting

585
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,000
No, no, no

586
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,079
It's what each needs

587
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:53,200
Specific steps

588
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,720
How to assassinate and escape

589
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:57,880
this

590
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,799
Have to wait for everyone

591
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,759
We’ll make arrangements when we get to Helan

592
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:01,799
When to set off

593
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:02,599
Me and Miqin Mubei

594
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:03,960
Set off now

595
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,599
Go back to Xingqing Mansion and be a good son

596
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,359
Heading to Helan Mountain with my dad

597
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,559
Just take a day off for the rest of you.

598
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,519
tomorrow

599
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:15,400
He Shaodu unified the army

600
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,400
Let’s go to the Holy Mountain together

601
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,640
Why delay

602
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,720
We'll set off immediately

603
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:23,319
I have to arrange

604
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:25,279
This road covers your journey

605
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:28,039
Can you give me one night?

606
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:32,799
That's it

607
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:33,960
Everyone

608
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,200
See you in Helan Mountain

609
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:44,359
I'm outside the door

610
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,960
Depart early tomorrow morning

611
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:49,079
Shaodu unified the army

612
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,359
There is a room at the back

613
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:55,960
Need not

614
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,640
Wait a minute

615
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,079
You haven't said it yet

616
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,319
Which fast was completely destroyed?

617
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:15,559
Sanzhai

618
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,319
Isn’t Fu Qingyu from Sanzhai?

619
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,119
That's right

620
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,960
Everyone is gone

621
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,240
yes

622
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:25,400
How did you die?

623
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,559
What I can tell you

624
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,279
It's them who finished it

625
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,519
mission Impossible

626
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,839
the price paid

627
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,640
That is, all members of Sanzhai died in the battle.

628
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,759
No one survives

629
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:42,960
You really like

630
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,319
That girl Zhao Jian

631
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:47,720
What's wrong with her?

632
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,599
you say it

633
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,039
I asked her to change

634
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:52,640
If Your Highness really likes her,

635
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,160
How could you agree?

636
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,279
She goes to Helan Mountain

637
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,279
As soon as they go

638
00:29:58,039 --> 00:29:59,480
Afraid of life or death

639
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,880
How can life and death be so unpredictable?

640
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:07,559
Rice Poultry

641
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:09,599
Not surprising

642
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:12,440
There is no life but death

643
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:14,039
do you mean

644
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,680
Their assassination failed

645
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:18,799
You think so

646
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,519
If they succeed in assassinating

647
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,079
Do I have to show up?

648
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:24,279
Avenge your father

649
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,559
Next

650
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:27,200
Gather his old troops

651
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,119
will be easier

652
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:30,079
So I have to kill those Song people for revenge.

653
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,119
What if the assassination fails?

654
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:34,960
Then there's no chance of leaving anyone alive.

655
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:36,799
What if they are caught by their father?

656
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:38,759
Wouldn't I be in danger?

657
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,480
So whether it succeeds or not

658
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,359
These Song people must die

659
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,559
It still hurts to think about it

660
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:48,680
to be honest

661
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,720
Really reluctant to part with it

662
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,359
But think about it carefully

663
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:53,960
For the great cause

664
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:56,720
I can give away my life at any time

665
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,599
What's more, my sweetheart

666
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:01,759
I arranged for her to die

667
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,039
I can still remember her in my heart

668
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,559
Also

669
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,960
Two hearts reflect each other

670
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,519
Is this how two hearts reflect each other?

671
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:13,119
Where is the horse hitch?

672
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:15,720
Front

673
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,160
Decide first whether to accept this mission or not.

674
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,400
others

675
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,200
Talk to you later

676
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,319
Sister Zhao, just decide

677
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,799
Listen to you

678
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:49,640
The chief's decision

679
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,400
It's Qizhai's decision

680
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:53,960
Said everything I wanted to say

681
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:55,240
I mean that too

682
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,559
we join

683
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,319
Set off tomorrow

684
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,599
have a good rest

685
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,160
Are you talking about Lu Nanshan?

686
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,400
He took over the Secret Pavilion

687
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:25,559
Must be an upstart from the military

688
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,440
I'll tell you another secret

689
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:32,400
He appears this time

690
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,680
Not to help Qizhai

691
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,640
Let's go

692
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,519
There's still a long way to go

693
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:44,920
Not this

694
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,680
You drink it while it's hot first.

695
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:02,720
Behind the Yanei

696
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,000
Light the fire and bake the pancakes?

697
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,920
You'll be able to eat it in a moment

698
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,079
Cooking in the office

699
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,240
He said he was good at cooking

700
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,240
Do you believe it

701
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:10,400
fine

702
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,319
Steamed cake

703
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:12,039
Eat something that won't kill you

704
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:14,880
or

705
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:16,240
I'm going to help

706
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:16,880
Need not

707
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:18,079
later

708
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,359
You still have to watch the first half of the night

709
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:21,039
Brother Wang said

710
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:21,920
He stayed late at night

711
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,400
today

712
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,759
None of us should disturb Sister Zhao.

713
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:30,119
She must be in a bad mood.

714
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:33,160
yes

715
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,079
or

716
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,079
You go accompany her

717
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:37,240
Brother Yuan is gone

718
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:38,640
Brother Wang said

719
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,079
at this time

720
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,759
Everything should be left to Brother Yuan

721
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,559
Too

722
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,519
Yuan Zhongxin is eloquent

723
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:47,960
Only him

724
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,199
when did you come

725
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,280
It's been a while

726
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,760
I didn't even notice

727
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,360
fine

728
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,519
very strange

729
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,719
I can't cry no matter what

730
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,519
Everyone is confused

731
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,079
fine

732
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,159
do not worry about me

733
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,039
People

734
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,440
Birth, old age, illness and death are inevitable

735
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,159
I'm fine

736
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:03,119
look

737
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:04,239
It's me

738
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:05,599
Very good at comforting myself

739
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,199
Yuan Zhongxin

740
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,119
It's me

741
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,599
Quite unfilial

742
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:16,599
why do you say so

743
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:19,400
It stands to reason that a relative dies

744
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,880
I should rush back immediately to mourn

745
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,159
But all I can think about is

746
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:26,920
Return to Beijing after completing the mission

747
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:30,519
If you spread the word, you will be scolded to death by others.

748
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:31,639
Who dares to scold you?

749
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:33,440
I just want to do something

750
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:35,679
Do something big

751
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,719
Make my dad proud of me

752
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,519
I know

753
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,280
Mr. Lu

754
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,199
I've been to your soup cake shop

755
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:07,960
The materials used are very practical

756
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,880
I remember

757
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:13,119
Your family is from a military household in Hebei Road.

758
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,760
What does Mr. Lu want to say?

759
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,960
speaking of

760
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,639
Your parents

761
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:19,800
Can you come to the capital to open a soup cake shop?

762
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:21,800
It was still the arrangement of my late father.

763
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,320
Now my father has passed away

764
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,519
Your soup cake shop

765
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:27,800
No one is protecting you

766
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,400
Can it still be driven?

767
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,880
Why can't I drive it?

768
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,320
Don't panic

769
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:42,880
Your family’s military status

770
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,079
My dad put it on.

771
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,880
I am the son

772
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:47,599
How can the verdict be reversed?

773
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:51,280
And as soon as the New Secret Pavilion is restarted,

774
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,559
Your business is my business

775
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,599
This soup cake shop

776
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,599
Drive on with peace of mind

777
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:06,360
Thank you Mr. Lu

778
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,599
The temple

779
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,519
Thank you, Manager

780
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:17,639
do you know

781
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:19,920
Among these seven fasts

782
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,599
You are the one that matters to me most.

783
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,119
I

784
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:25,599
Children of military households

785
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:28,480
Know the rules for following orders

786
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:29,400
Xue Ying

787
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:30,800
I want to ask you something

788
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,119
Do you think that among these seven fasts?

789
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,880
Who has any dissatisfaction?

790
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,119
alienation

791
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:38,559
Be more specific

792
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,519
Who will betray the Secret Pavilion?

793
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,880
No one knows

794
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,320
What if I said yes?

795
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:47,679
That's why you're wrong

796
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,280
This trip west

797
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,119
Give you a job

798
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,960
Keep an eye on them for me

799
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,880
look who's there

800
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,639
During this assassination mission

801
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,440
harbor dissent

802
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,079
Or act sneakily

803
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:08,679
Never

804
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,880
If there are any clues

805
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,199
You need to draw your knife

806
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:14,079
This is a military order

807
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,840
how

808
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,440
Don't take military orders

809
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,519
Xue Ying in Charge

810
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:33,559
so i said

811
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:35,639
You are the one that matters to me most.

812
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,559
These words

813
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:39,360
Do not tell others

814
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,039
Keep it in your heart

815
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,159
The wind is getting stronger

816
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,000
Did you hear that

817
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,760
It should be debris that fell from the eaves.

818
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,800
blown down by the wind

819
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:12,719
Touched the window lattice

820
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:19,679
Don't open the window

821
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:32,920
its me

822
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,880
Before entering the Secret Pavilion

823
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,440
live at home

824
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,360
I always quarrel with my father

825
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,480
He wants me to get married

826
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:46,800
I won't

827
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,960
I always feel that living is so boring

828
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,400
Chest tightness

829
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,159
Can't breathe

830
00:39:57,079 --> 00:39:58,440
Always quarreling with him

831
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,719
Then I put myself

832
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:05,920
shut in the house

833
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,480
My dad is worried about me

834
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,599
Just outside the window

835
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:17,000
open the window

836
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,880
Open a small gap and peek at me

837
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,199
See if I have eaten

838
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,000
Not happy

839
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:29,159
Did you sneak out of the house secretly?

840
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,559
He stood there for a long time.

841
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:35,960
thought i didn't know

842
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,639
Actually I know everything

843
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,719
Him

844
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,320
clumsy

845
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,360
Arms and legs

846
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,280
Always banging against the window

847
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:56,840
that voice

848
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,199
Exactly the same as this one just now

849
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,960
Actually I never believe in ghosts and gods

850
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:08,559
but don't know why

851
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,639
I feel it right now

852
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:16,119
He is the one who came to see me

853
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,840
My dad is always worried

854
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,039
I'm alone in this world

855
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:25,960
Can't stand it

856
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,480
The wind stopped

857
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,119
The wind stopped

858
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
He has been here

859
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,840
My dad is gone.

860
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,280
My dad is gone.

861
00:43:31,719 --> 00:43:34,360
I'm the only one left in this world

862
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,199
And I

863
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,079
And I

864
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:23,519
what is that

865
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,880
I just saw

866
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:28,559
There is a shadow on the cliff

867
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:29,679
Presumably high up

868
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,480
Someone is offering sacrifices to the dead

869
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,440
wrong

870
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:34,880
I saw that shadow

871
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,760
With horns

872
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,639
Sheep horns

873
00:44:37,639 --> 00:44:38,320
right

874
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:41,480
Either I saw it wrong

875
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,239
Either

876
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:45,320
It's the gods who show up.
