1
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:47,173
You two already knew

2
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:48,174
What’s the matter with Wang Kuan?

3
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:50,343
It's not too early

4
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,878
Then you should be in advance

5
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:52,979
Tell Xiao Jing

6
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:54,914
Is it still a surprise if you tell me in advance?

7
00:01:59,119 --> 00:01:59,853
you

8
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:01,721
Did we grow up together?

9
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:02,555
Not really

10
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:03,723
We've known each other for a few years

11
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:04,691
Only a few years

12
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,392
can be entrusted with life and death

13
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:08,361
Didn’t Wang Kuan just say that?

14
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,263
Prime Minister Bai knows that he still presses his sword

15
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:11,898
It doesn’t matter how long we’ve known each other

16
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:12,999
What is the white head?

17
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,301
Prime Minister Bai knows that he still presses his sword

18
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:16,870
Wang Mojie's famous sayings

19
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,772
Wang Mojie is also your friend

20
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:22,709
He is not

21
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,110
He was a poet of the Tang Dynasty

22
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:25,912
You Song people

23
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,747
Can everyone read and recite poetry?

24
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:30,617
Definitely not everyone

25
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,821
What about Xue Ying?

26
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,122
Him

27
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:37,857
He knows how to wield a knife and a gun

28
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,026
Memorizing poetry is a mess

29
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,463
But I think

30
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:44,697
Sword dancing is good.

31
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:12,825
My dad is here

32
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:15,361
Xiao Xue

33
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:16,296
calm

34
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,203
Go back and sit down

35
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,322
This is the commander-in-chief of the Youzhou capital

36
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,256
Liang Gewei

37
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:51,898
Xiao Xue

38
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:52,999
sit down

39
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,105
Aren’t your martial arts skills even higher?

40
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,907
Why was he arrested as soon as he showed his face?

41
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,175
No matter how high your martial arts skills are

42
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:03,443
There are too many people.

43
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,278
What did the commander-in-chief of Liang Du say?

44
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,280
I'll give you a moment to burn incense

45
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,314
tell me

46
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:09,349
why should i

47
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,817
Risking life and death with you

48
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,385
Enemy with Qingtianzi

49
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:13,853
Is the truth made clear?

50
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,388
I will cooperate with you

51
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,856
give him back to you

52
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,225
What if it doesn't make sense?

53
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,562
I'll give you his head back

54
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:24,197
sit

55
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,199
I can't get up

56
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:27,467
Then I sit and talk

57
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,037
If you don't cooperate, then don't cooperate.

58
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:32,672
Why kill people?

59
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,174
It makes no sense

60
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,377
Do you think I look like a reasonable person?

61
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:39,879
It doesn't really look like it

62
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:42,015
You should be more attentive in persuading me.

63
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:44,317
let's start

64
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:45,218
remember

65
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,020
The time of a stick of incense

66
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:53,493
Fragrant

67
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,494
What

68
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:56,496
You just said the time for one stick of incense

69
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:57,397
Don't light this fragrance

70
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:58,298
How do you calculate time?

71
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:02,201
You didn't bring any incense

72
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:03,870
OK

73
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,071
Yanei

74
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:19,319
What is he doing?

75
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:20,153
Going to look for incense

76
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,175
Don't be in a hurry. Don't be in a hurry.

77
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:43,109
Take it easy

78
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,360
The time of a stick of incense

79
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:01,461
The fragrance is ready

80
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,263
Why do you bring incense when you go out?

81
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:05,898
To tell you the truth

82
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:06,699
If not for this

83
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,934
The space in the car is not big enough

84
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:09,602
We even brought the coffin

85
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,904
Yes, that's what I use for sleeping.

86
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,973
Wouldn't that be very disturbing?

87
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,508
I have a mattress inside

88
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,077
That's okay

89
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:21,080
you listen

90
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,115
hurry up

91
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:23,983
You don't have much time

92
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,521
I'll do that

93
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:29,355
Go ahead

94
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:34,827
Let me confirm with you again

95
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,295
what you just meant

96
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,464
It takes a stick of incense to convince you

97
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:39,499
Cooperate with us

98
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:40,099
right

99
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,435
Then if it takes just one stick of incense

100
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:42,902
Exceed

101
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,872
Just chop off Xue Ying's head

102
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:46,439
Right

103
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:47,874
That's what it means

104
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,377
It's up to you whether you can save him or not.

105
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:52,945
OK

106
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:18,237
Went out

107
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:19,539
You kill Xue Ying

108
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,740
what are you doing

109
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:24,477
Kill you and kill Xue Ying

110
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:25,111
these words

111
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,112
Which word do you not understand?

112
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,613
Do you think I dare not?

113
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:33,920
what are you doing

114
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:34,987
Willing to admit defeat

115
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,355
Liang Du ordered the army to invite

116
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:49,635
father

117
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:00,213
You just can't keep calm

118
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:01,614
Look at other people

119
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,224
You really think I don’t dare to kill him

120
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:12,758
Of course you dare to kill him

121
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,627
Of course he dares to kill us

122
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:15,962
Then what

123
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:17,563
Are you waiting for Yuan Hao to kill you?

124
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:19,632
Why did Yuan Hao want to kill me?

125
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:20,666
The left wing commanded the army

126
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,601
and the right wing both commanded the army

127
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:22,468
has now become

128
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:23,536
Yuan Hao's personal guard

129
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:25,304
This situation now

130
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:27,173
Can't you see?

131
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:30,443
Did you really explain it to him?

132
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,313
I talked too much

133
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:36,182
Excuse me

134
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,252
What does Yuan Hao want to do?

135
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,320
Du Tongjun, you know best

136
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,122
so

137
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,624
We are not here to advise you

138
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:45,625
cooperate with us

139
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:47,860
Rather, you have now

140
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,895
No way back

141
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,464
Lu Nanshan

142
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,933
Anyway, walking in the Privy Council of the Song Dynasty

143
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:55,801
what about you

144
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,538
A bunch of common people brats

145
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,673
Lu Nanshan didn’t dare to kill Yuan Hao

146
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:02,341
we dare

147
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,541
I heard I have money now

148
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,678
I heard you are very good at fighting now.

149
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,614
amazing

150
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,818
Cooperation can

151
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,420
a condition

152
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:49,855
Convince Queen Yeli

153
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,791
The Queen Does Not Enter the Game

154
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,593
Youzhou Army stayed out of the matter

155
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,627
I know

156
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,963
I will take a trip to Helan Mountain myself

157
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:58,831
Waiting for your news

158
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,935
How about I send them to Helan Mountain?

159
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,503
you are with them

160
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,305
How can I stay out of it?

161
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,240
Walk

162
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:11,877
Let’s discuss later

163
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:46,746
We Qizhai are together again

164
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,547
very nice

165
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:50,816
Three years

166
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,052
Everyone has changed

167
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,554
yes

168
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:57,857
But you haven't changed

169
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:00,993
Even you have changed

170
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:03,696
Looks better

171
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:05,998
real or fake

172
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,099
real

173
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:08,334
Feeling particularly good

174
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,904
Maybe the rouge used is better

175
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,073
What rouge

176
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,107
I've prepared it for you too

177
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:15,775
No, no, no

178
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,076
This has nothing to do with rouge

179
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:18,611
The most important thing is to have a good foundation

180
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:19,979
How do you say that

181
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,213
Naturally beautiful

182
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:23,549
Yuan Zhongxin

183
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:24,984
You have changed too

184
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,052
How has he changed?

185
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:29,789
Become more fond of telling the truth

186
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:32,425
Makes sense

187
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,162
Okay everyone

188
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,431
Our current goal is simple

189
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,066
Go to Helan Mountain first

190
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,101
Meet up with Yasai

191
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:43,703
Then meet Queen Yeli

192
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,137
Convince Queen Yeli

193
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:46,439
Winning over the Youzhou Army

194
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:47,773
reuse at last

195
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:49,041
Bazhai's plan to become a god

196
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:51,610
Three-pronged approach to capture Yuan Hao

197
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:52,878
Now it seems

198
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,180
Sounds like the hardest level

199
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,681
This is the level of Queen Yeli

200
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,718
Ning Lingge’s mother

201
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,252
Yuan Hao's wife

202
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:02,455
Didn't know it would be

203
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,456
what kind of person

204
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,937
What are you doing up so early?

205
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,841
I really have a dream

206
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:25,878
Your Highness

207
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,146
Please go faster

208
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:28,681
Didn't wake up

209
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,716
What time is this?

210
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:32,918
I was so tired last night.

211
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,353
what did you do last night

212
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,189
hunt

213
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:37,823
beat

214
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,460
Helan Mountain is a holy mountain

215
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,962
How dare you hunt?

216
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:44,830
Keep your voice down

217
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,066
Not good to be heard

218
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:49,668
Then don't go

219
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:51,070
good

220
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,139
move

221
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,473
The Queen has been waiting for a long time.

222
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:55,708
Come on, your highness.

223
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:01,113
Please wake up

224
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:38,818
Queen Mother

225
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:43,823
Queen Mother

226
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:45,157
why are you crying

227
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:46,759
Queen Mother

228
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,095
This tastes terrible

229
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:54,600
How do you eat it?

230
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,868
The grass seeds from the East Wing are here

231
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,503
This is what the tribesmen eat because they have no choice but to eat it.

232
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,105
Fighting every year these years

233
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,174
In my territory of Daxia

234
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:04,243
Can you still eat this?

235
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,011
Already rare

236
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,980
You are the Queen of Daxia after all.

237
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,148
Not to the point

238
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,350
You silly boy

239
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,652
This is for others to see

240
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:15,988
Let's eat it every two days.

241
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:17,590
Those common people

242
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:19,658
I'll be moved to tears just by looking at it.

243
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,095
Let’s talk about eating grass seeds

244
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:24,864
able to win over people's hearts

245
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:26,232
Not a loss

246
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,737
But there's no one else here

247
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:38,377
Eat for you to see

248
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,314
The Queen just

249
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:43,716
Met several generals accompanying the army

250
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,451
No wonder

251
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:46,585
How about it

252
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,454
People's hearts are tightened

253
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,957
They are all the elites of the Left Wing Army.

254
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,893
Your father's confidant.

255
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,694
How can it be so easy?

256
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,363
take it easy

257
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:58,597
But everyone is gone

258
00:14:58,597 --> 00:14:59,865
Just stop eating it

259
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,701
I am short of food in Daxia

260
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,336
This is not a waste

261
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,472
Okay, okay, okay, I'll come

262
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:16,982
It really tastes terrible

263
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,075
I am the most loyal minister of Daxia

264
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,310
It has to be a rice bird

265
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:46,578
I heard

266
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,180
You went hunting last night

267
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:50,549
how do you know

268
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,750
What did you hit?

269
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:53,719
shot a dog

270
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,388
Are there wild dogs in Helan Mountain?

271
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,057
hounds brought

272
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,224
Why did you shoot it?

273
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:01,360
Missed the shot

274
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,540
I almost forgot

275
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,876
This kid, Mi Qin, is worried about you.

276
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,411
Talk about you these days

277
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,347
Either hunting or sleeping

278
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:23,949
I'm afraid you'll be depressed

279
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,586
Let your mother talk about you

280
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:29,788
I am now under your command

281
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,156
Just a few teams of soldiers

282
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,491
This time the sacrifice

283
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,393
In name, I am in charge of the army.

284
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,160
Generals who can lead troops

285
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,261
Some of them listen to me

286
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:38,497
Let’s talk about the court

287
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,832
I don't even have an errand

288
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:41,667
I don’t hunt and sleep every day

289
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,501
What else can I do

290
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:45,871
Right

291
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,241
It's right that it can't be

292
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,511
You have to find the opportunity yourself.

293
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,680
There is an old saying among the Han people

294
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,518
What an old saying

295
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:00,719
Sit down and taste courage

296
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,022
Taste the courage of lying down

297
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:04,590
Survival from desperate situation

298
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,395
Mi Qin, tell him yourself.

299
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:13,332
Your Highness

300
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:15,334
You are the prince of Daxia

301
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:16,835
Although the king is brave

302
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,303
But one day

303
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,072
you will replace

304
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:21,373
Before that

305
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,575
You must not be depressed or slack off.

306
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:29,314
This will replace your head with a beheading

307
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:30,516
If you can wake up His Highness

308
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:32,451
I will die without regrets

309
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:39,992
You get up first

310
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,062
stand up

311
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:48,100
Rice poultry

312
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,503
There is an old saying among the Han people:

313
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:53,872
It’s called hiding one’s strength and biding one’s time keeping a low profile.

314
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:55,841
You can't keep it up all the time.

315
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,943
Father is too strong

316
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:01,713
This rumor about the goat-keeper

317
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:03,315
have you heard of it

318
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:05,184
heard

319
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:06,919
Hasn’t it been spread all over the past few years?

320
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,422
Gods walk in the lower world

321
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,391
It's not ordinary.

322
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,158
yes

323
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:14,993
Frequent appearances of sacred sites

324
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,563
Although most people believe in Buddhism

325
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:18,597
But now look

326
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:19,832
This goat-keeper

327
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,100
In Daxia

328
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,334
There are also believers

329
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:23,936
Worse

330
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,637
They are from beginning to end

331
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,339
Keep telling the public

332
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,975
The father is blessed by the gods

333
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:31,877
He is good at fighting

334
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,113
Now I have the support of gods

335
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,881
His title of Qingtianzi

336
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,483
Now in Daxia

337
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:38,851
No one questions it anymore

338
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:40,219
That’s all

339
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,753
How can I fight?

340
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,224
Those angels should die

341
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:48,393
Damn it indeed

342
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,597
Divine protection

343
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:53,499
No taboos

344
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,300
If things go on like this

345
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,936
There is no way to survive

346
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,275
This time the sacrifice

347
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,278
The Sheep Guardian is also on the mountain

348
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:07,679
of course

349
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,348
Now worship

350
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,184
How to avoid the goat god

351
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,853
His Highness came to Helan Mountain this time

352
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:19,024
Could it be that he wants to take action against the divine envoy?

353
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,470
It turns out that His Highness is not depressed

354
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:32,738
Very good

355
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:34,573
Attack the angel

356
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:35,874
So bold

357
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,743
This is my prince of Daxia

358
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:40,712
What's the use of just having courage?

359
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,215
Now the left wing army is watching closely

360
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,583
I'm hunting

361
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:46,218
Everyone is staring at them

362
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,619
tied hands and feet

363
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,455
Not to mention killing the angel

364
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:09,374
go

365
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:11,877
Let those two commanders

366
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:12,978
Please come back

367
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,451
Don't you mean to tie your hands and feet?

368
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,387
Queen mother will help you to persuade them.

369
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:25,591
What's the use of persuading?

370
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,594
Try your best

371
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:38,403
Didn’t you just meet me?

372
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,138
Why are you summoning me again?

373
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,541
Who is this person?

374
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:45,043
The Queen's Guards

375
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,379
Looks like a young man from the Yeli tribe

376
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,081
Empress's family

377
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:51,350
No wonder

378
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:53,652
What is he carrying?

379
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:54,853
Who knows?

380
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:56,855
Let's go

381
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:58,423
After all, it was the Queen who summoned

382
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,658
Still have to go

383
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:01,293
Let's go

384
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:16,675
see queen

385
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:18,910
His Royal Highness the Crown Prince is also here

386
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,148
Invite two commanders to come

387
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:25,384
Also for my son

388
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,585
The Prince Has Ordered

389
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,153
We shall obey

390
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,222
Brother Ning Ling

391
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,557
I feel like the goat-keeper said

392
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,694
Maybe someone is pretending to be a god

393
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:37,696
He wants to eliminate traitors for the country

394
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,132
Eradicate those so-called angels

395
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,302
I don’t know what you two think

396
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,304
Qing Tianzi explained

397
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,739
The envoys of the sheep guardians should be honored with national courtesy.

398
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:49,741
Never take action

399
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,079
Orders from the Queen and the Crown Prince

400
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,147
Don't you listen too?

401
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,383
It’s really hard to disobey the king’s order

402
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:01,653
It seems hard to persuade

403
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,322
Queen Mother

404
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,424
I have the order from my father.

405
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:06,858
It’s not good to embarrass others

406
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:08,760
Thank you for your understanding, Prince.

407
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:11,196
OK

408
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:12,898
Then let's not talk about it.

409
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:14,900
look

410
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,202
These fresh fruits and meats

411
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,670
We can't finish eating either

412
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,238
Would you like to come over and try it?

413
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:21,440
I wouldn't dare

414
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,710
We don’t have so many rules in Daxia

415
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:25,744
It's fine

416
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:26,812
Moreover

417
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,381
Our mother and son

418
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:32,417
I still have to rely on the support of the two of them.

419
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,953
Eat some meat and some fruit

420
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,521
What does this mean?

421
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:38,757
You're welcome

422
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,629
Then obey.

423
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:57,242
You're welcome

424
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:58,243
Eat

425
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,022
Eat it

426
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,981
If it’s not easy to persuade, then don’t persuade.

427
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:57,736
Go Go Go

428
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:07,879
What should I do now?

429
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:16,555
or

430
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:17,956
Eat some more

431
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,358
It's time

432
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:21,660
We Daxia people

433
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,961
Not wasting food

434
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,431
Didn't you say that you were tied up?

435
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:27,899
it's good now

436
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,468
No more

437
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:31,736
You can't just go the other way, right?

438
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,271
That's definitely not possible.

439
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,173
Lead troops in war

440
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:37,476
Who can win over your father?

441
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:39,611
This is neither big nor small

442
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,179
There are also two commanders

443
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:42,881
How should I explain when I return to Xingqing Mansion?

444
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:45,750
Just say

445
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:48,186
They were the ones who made the first move

446
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:49,955
Kill the angel

447
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,090
Such a big thing

448
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,426
We definitely can't let it go

449
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:56,828
According to the law

450
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:58,830
Kill them

451
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:00,665
Revenge for the angels

452
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,267
how

453
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:09,140
People who believe in the Goat God are everywhere in the government and the public

454
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:10,842
Such a big crime

455
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:13,945
We can't bear it

456
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:15,013
But those soldiers outside

457
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:15,747
what to do

458
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:17,482
They all saw it

459
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:18,517
people die here

460
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:23,255
It's up to you

461
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:27,259
Two commanders died

462
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:28,860
The soldiers of this battalion

463
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,428
They're leaderless

464
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:32,063
or

465
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,899
Just accept them

466
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,234
If you can accept them

467
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:38,603
None of this is a problem

468
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,539
If you can't conquer

469
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:42,474
Let’s go back to Xingqing Mansion

470
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:44,309
All must be finished

471
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:51,816
I think you can do it

472
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:54,719
Queen Mother

473
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,922
I'll use the knife later

474
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:59,057
You still have to tell me in advance

475
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,594
Haven't you forgotten this?

476
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:04,496
Try your best to

477
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,098
Come and eat meat

478
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:23,515
The camp at the foot of the mountain is a bit messy.

479
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,959
Ning Lingge has been silent for three years

480
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,895
After all, I couldn't bear it anymore.

481
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:40,131
Do you think it was Brother Ning Ling who seized power?

482
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:41,533
pretty close

483
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:42,601
this is a good thing

484
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:45,837
Apart from Yuan Hao, we can’t do it without him.

485
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,274
How about we go down the mountain to meet him?

486
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:51,543
Wait for Qizhai to come

487
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,585
Will Yanei come too?

488
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:01,519
possible

489
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:11,229
What's wrong

490
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:17,102
He saw me

491
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,803
Will you be afraid?

492
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,148
Helan Mountain

493
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:36,454
Three years later

494
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:38,156
revisit old places

495
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:39,858
Or just a few of us

496
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:49,000
I don’t know Chu Niao and the others

497
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,834
Are you still there?

498
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,237
We can get there today

499
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:54,372
I'll go there first

500
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:57,909
I'm here too

501
00:27:58,843 --> 00:27:59,611
See Helan Mountain

502
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:34,879
Why are you still holding a sword?

503
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:38,917
I have to watch over you when you sleep

504
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:42,854
Why do you need to guard it yourself?

505
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:45,023
Isn't there one beside you?

506
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:46,825
The young guard of the Nori clan?

507
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,193
Going up the mountain

508
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,830
The God of Killing cannot hesitate

509
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:03,842
Rice poultry

510
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,277
He is also busy

511
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:07,779
seize military power

512
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:11,015
You believe him.

513
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,817
You can sleep peacefully here

514
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:19,891
Aren't you here?

515
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:22,093
I've already placed someone

516
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,361
By his side

517
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:24,796
A slight movement

518
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:26,498
Heads on the ground

519
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:28,700
But I have to say

520
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,002
He did a good job indeed

521
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:32,737
He has been good

522
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:33,938
I told you

523
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,142
Can't do it wholeheartedly

524
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:38,376
to trust someone

525
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,680
I know

526
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:45,817
You've always taught me this

527
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:48,720
This is your father's way of life

528
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:56,661
Mother, you say

529
00:29:58,263 --> 00:29:59,731
Can I really defeat my father?

530
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:00,832
He is a human

531
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:02,867
As long as it's human

532
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:05,637
Everyone makes mistakes

533
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:08,339
You these three years

534
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,375
Aren't you pretending to be depressed?

535
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,412
Didn’t I also deceive him?

536
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:15,814
yes

537
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:18,783
He is also a human being

538
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,053
Make mistakes too

539
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,432
The left wing army went up the mountain

540
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,101
murderous

541
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,577
Mr. Wen, look

542
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:47,412
let's escape

543
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:18,877
That is

544
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:20,912
Xue Ying

545
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,866
Xue Ying is so strong now

546
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:43,868
It used to be great

547
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,103
It's even scarier now

548
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:48,273
good

549
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:51,910
What do you mean by okay?

550
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,511
Can you beat him?

551
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:55,980
Yanei

552
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:03,922
What are you asking for?

553
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,123
Can you beat Xue Ying?

554
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:08,760
Can't beat

555
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:12,063
Just admitted it

556
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:13,431
Is there a problem

557
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:15,600
I thought you were going to say something

558
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,801
Animals are stronger than humans

559
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,603
People need to rely on wisdom and so on

560
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,537
Ridiculing Xue Ying?

561
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:21,072
Why should I mock him?

562
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:23,107
Don't you often mock me?

563
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:25,877
When have I ever ridiculed you?

564
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:28,012
You don’t always talk about me

565
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,213
Fighting is not allowed

566
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:30,748
Reading and fooling around

567
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:31,883
Are you mentally retarded?

568
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:35,186
I said

569
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,587
so

570
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,460
What I'm asking is

571
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:44,295
When have I ever ridiculed you?

572
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:45,396
Isn't this what it is?

573
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:48,066
never mind

574
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,500
Forget it

575
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:52,403
wait

576
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,440
Do you have any talents?

577
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,108
Why forget these two words?

578
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:57,875
come out of your mouth

579
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:59,077
So irritating

580
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:02,580
Yanei, don't be angry

581
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,015
Young Master Wen has always been like this

582
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:07,385
Aren't you angry too?

583
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:09,587
got used to

584
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:12,991
It won't be easy for you either

585
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:16,027
Should we go first?

586
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:17,095
right

587
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:18,830
The chief of my family is coming soon, too.

588
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:19,497
Let's go

589
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:59,270
I was just about to ask what you were carrying

590
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:08,880
Stronger again

591
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:33,171
Where is that old Tang from your Bazhai?

592
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:34,705
Very strong

593
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:35,873
The one who can carry rocks

594
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:41,813
What's wrong

595
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:45,616
died

596
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:47,852
How did you die?

597
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:48,719
die in battle

598
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,189
Aren't you just pretending to be a ghost?

599
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:52,590
How could he die in battle?

600
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:54,425
After becoming famous

601
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,194
Someone keeps checking our details

602
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:58,396
Old Tang accidentally found himself in Xingqing Mansion

603
00:34:58,396 --> 00:34:59,497
Revealed

604
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:01,032
he thinks

605
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:01,933
We keep the goat god

606
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,501
It’s not easy to pretend to this stage

607
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:05,203
Don't give up halfway

608
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,872
He rushed into the government office alone

609
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:10,141
Bring the few city guards who know the information

610
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:10,942
Kill them all

611
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:14,712
That you

612
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:16,514
when something goes wrong

613
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:18,783
Mr. Wen and I are not in Xingqing Mansion

614
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,521
The bones were buried

615
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:25,857
No

616
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:27,291
Why

617
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:31,262
Old Tang was furious when he was about to die

618
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:33,898
He burned down both the government office and himself.

619
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:36,334
All burned

620
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:38,703
No one knows it was him who did it

621
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,572
Mr. Wen and I are here

622
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,341
It's safe

623
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:44,675
When did it happen

624
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,411
More than a year

625
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:49,981
Young Master Wen even cried

626
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:53,351
I didn't cry

627
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,787
He cried

628
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:58,589
Crying while hiding from others

629
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:10,301
Yanei

630
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:15,640
have you already seen

631
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:34,592
Thank you Yanei

632
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:35,993
no need thank me

633
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,463
You even pretended not to see it

634
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:40,598
Didn't ask me either

635
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:41,799
Very attentive

636
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:51,442
This is

637
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:53,477
Injuried

638
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:54,745
blind

639
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:04,255
fake miracles

640
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,023
Being spotted by Shiboyuan

641
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,191
Shibuyuan

642
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,428
Here in Xixia

643
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:12,630
The First Divination Garden is in charge of divination.

644
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:15,132
Do you think it’s funny or not?

645
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,467
Ruling the country by divination

646
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:22,974
Young Master Wen leads us to create miracles

647
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,575
They definitely can't figure it out.

648
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:26,210
Isn't this embarrassing?

649
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:27,912
Just keep an eye on us

650
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,984
They suspect that you are not the messengers of God

651
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:33,918
That's not true

652
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,753
They're quite superstitious

653
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:36,754
Especially believe that we are

654
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:37,622
God's Messenger

655
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:38,823
Then I'll take action against you

656
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:41,993
Matters about wealth and future

657
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:43,628
God wants to kill too

658
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:48,466
Comments from Wen Shao

659
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,302
Everything in the world is for profit

660
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:55,773
Those guys don't dare to face the enemy head on

661
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,942
They're all using smoke and poison.

662
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:01,479
I got a poisonous needle

663
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:03,147
Would have died

664
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,182
Then I will

665
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:06,617
dig it out yourself

666
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:07,918
save your life

667
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,821
It hurts, right?

668
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,193
Very painful

669
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:18,829
I kept crying

670
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:20,865
I fainted once in the middle

671
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:22,199
Luckily I woke up quickly

672
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,709
Young Master Wen was besieged at that time

673
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:32,943
So it's just me

674
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:33,978
he's fine

675
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,546
He killed all the poisoners

676
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:36,814
Shi Bu Yuan was later frightened by him

677
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:37,982
I didn't dare to take action again

678
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:39,317
If it weren't for Wen Shao

679
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,118
The Sheep God cannot enter Xingqing Mansion

680
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:48,259
Yanei

681
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:52,697
sorry

682
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:53,931
Why are you apologizing suddenly?

683
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:55,199
last time we met

684
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,634
what I said

685
00:38:58,469 --> 00:38:59,704
Do you think I'm okay?

686
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:00,838
Waiting for you and me

687
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:02,573
Get everything done

688
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,708
Think again

689
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,109
Do you want to spend time together?

690
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,211
I will consider it carefully

691
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,079
this answer

692
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:12,316
I take it all back

693
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,151
Why

694
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:19,657
I'm so disabled now

695
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:25,196
I don't deserve you.

696
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:31,135
The wind is so strong

697
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:32,303
My eyes are blinded

698
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:45,282
actually, I

699
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,217
Yanei

700
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:49,820
Go quickly. There are people behind you.

701
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:58,195
Prince

702
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:02,500
The whole army conquered

703
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,034
Willing to serve the prince

704
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:05,903
So fast

705
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,371
Yes, it went well

706
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:09,974
After all, he is the elite of the Left Wing Army.

707
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:11,776
Unexpectedly, there were quite a few

708
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,110
People who are greedy for life and afraid of death

709
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:15,579
If I weren't trying to win over the military,

710
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,515
I'll have to chop off a bunch of his heads again

711
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:20,017
Let's chop off the head later.

712
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:21,118
Right

713
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,220
Before we go back to Xingqing Mansion

714
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:25,322
Need to be screened again carefully

715
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:26,390
certainly

716
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:27,825
We still need His Highness the Crown Prince

717
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:28,793
Giving both kindness and power

718
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:29,560
so

719
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:31,595
Even if we are in the left wing army

720
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:33,130
Put a nail in

721
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,001
This strength

722
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:39,069
In front of the Father

723
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:40,438
Simply not worth mentioning

724
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,274
Still have to take it slow

725
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:46,076
Still have to spend time finding allies

726
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:47,478
Can't slow down

727
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:49,780
You didn't see it

728
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,916
Your newly born brother

729
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:53,751
How much his father likes him

730
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:57,621
All the civil and military officials of the entire dynasty also saw it.

731
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:00,224
If you lose your position as crown prince

732
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:03,093
who will follow you

733
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:05,362
So can't wait

734
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:06,664
Take action quickly

735
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,600
Otherwise there will never be a chance

736
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:10,734
Not enough troops

737
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,737
One knife is enough to kill someone

738
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:14,705
Guarding the palace gate

739
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:16,340
But they are all soldiers of hundreds of battles

740
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,543
The prince can carry a sword when he enters the palace

741
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:20,344
Queen Mother

742
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:21,812
Could it be that you want me to

743
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,280
Do it yourself

744
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:25,749
He is my biological father

745
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:27,952
That is also my biological husband

746
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:30,120
but it doesn't matter

747
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:32,590
There is an old saying among the Han people

748
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:35,459
What's coming

749
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:38,362
Kill relatives for justice

750
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,096
right

751
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:41,131
They have all kinds of sayings

752
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:44,068
and can be used in any situation

753
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:45,469
But do we have righteousness?

754
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:48,105
who cares

755
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:52,243
coming

756
00:41:58,883 --> 00:41:59,550
Wen Shao

757
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:00,551
Chu Niao

758
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:10,661
Do you know Brother Ning Ling?

759
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:12,463
So ungrateful

760
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:13,731
Just say it directly

761
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:14,665
No polite words

762
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,335
have you eaten

763
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,303
hello

764
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,438
Do you know Brother Ning Ling?

765
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:23,040
know

766
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,041
very good

767
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:25,276
Let’s go see Brother Ning Ling

768
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:26,310
And Queen Yeli

769
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,879
Do you really want to convince Queen Yeli?

770
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:29,980
Betray Yuan Hao

771
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,515
They are a couple after all

772
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:38,322
