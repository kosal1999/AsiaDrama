1
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:11,097
I saw Brother Ning Ling

2
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:12,499
See you

3
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,002
why assassination

4
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:17,270
He also asked

5
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:18,438
he asked

6
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:19,973
I also answered

7
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,242
Revenge?

8
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:23,610
Human nature

9
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:24,777
He believed it

10
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,146
except revenge

11
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:27,680
He couldn't think of

12
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,982
What other reasons do we have

13
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:29,983
Want to assassinate Yuan Hao

14
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,622
What about those Song people?

15
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,056
Left behind by him

16
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,059
Arrange for someone to sneak into the back hall

17
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,961
How to poison

18
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,796
Naturally, I have to ask more carefully.

19
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,098
should

20
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,868
Think about this banquet

21
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,637
So many people are going to die

22
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:53,173
I still feel a little uncomfortable

23
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,076
In the mud and bones

24
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,512
can bloom

25
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,681
Then let more people die.

26
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:04,250
let this flower

27
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:06,920
Open more vigorously

28
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,057
You were saved by Wu Zangxuanpang

29
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,760
He also planned the assassination of Yuan Hao.

30
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,062
They are brother and sister

31
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,864
really for

32
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,065
Wild profit meets beggar's revenge

33
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,266
and take this risk

34
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,468
According to your situation in Xixia

35
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:23,870
Yuan Hao is dead

36
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,939
What good do they have as siblings?

37
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:29,876
No benefit at all

38
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,413
Then there is no reason

39
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,814
It can only be revenge

40
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:36,783
good

41
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,785
Then believe it for now

42
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,991
you are still alive

43
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:46,693
I am very happy

44
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:48,194
I'm happier than you

45
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:50,930
I'm getting married

46
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:52,699
what do you want to say

47
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:55,935
Congratulations

48
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:58,304
She is of the unimmigrant family

49
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,173
I am also a member of the Daxia clan.

50
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,675
Marriage between big families is reasonable

51
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,480
It’s a pity that men and women in this world

52
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,615
It's all fate

53
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,184
That doesn't mean

54
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:11,951
My engagement here

55
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,052
It's still perfect

56
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:17,390
It is said that

57
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,494
Yuan Zhongxin fell into the glacier

58
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:24,530
No bones left

59
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:26,199
He's not dead

60
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:29,335
I didn't dream about him

61
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:30,303
What

62
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:31,971
If he died

63
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,440
Will definitely come to my dream

64
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,375
say goodbye to me

65
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:38,878
Do you believe this?

66
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:39,879
You do not understand

67
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,482
This is the engagement

68
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,017
The order of life and death

69
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,785
Big things are happening now

70
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,820
Just cooperate wholeheartedly

71
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:49,922
The queen mother is right

72
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:55,962
wedding day

73
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,065
I'll take this girl to the back hall

74
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,074
I'd better do it

75
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,346
You arrange the maid

76
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,614
inconsistent with common sense

77
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,417
It will inevitably arouse suspicion

78
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,220
Okay, then I'll trouble my mother.

79
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:24,457
Everyone

80
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,459
Help my son take over Daxia

81
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,361
My mother and I are allies

82
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:32,131
There will be a big reward after the deed is accomplished

83
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:38,104
I heard Wei Zhuoran is coming

84
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,074
Yes, tomorrow morning.

85
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,508
I want to see him

86
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,428
There's no road ahead here.

87
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,467
The road must be walked by people

88
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,076
Yuanhao didn’t invite you

89
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,077
That's what you plan to do

90
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,011
Walked over swaggeringly

91
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:22,915
Watch the horse for me and don't lose it

92
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,385
It's not easy to tame it

93
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:26,919
Don't worry, sir.

94
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:28,121
I'll be there when I'm on horseback

95
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:32,392
You go your own way

96
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,227
I will dive into the darkness

97
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:41,267
Let's go

98
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:45,171
Take care sir

99
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,115
How many days have I left the palace?

100
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:29,982
We'll live here

101
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:33,119
This looks like the security is not tight.

102
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,122
Going further inside is the main hall of the Riigong Palace.

103
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:37,390
This is near the palace gate

104
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,758
It was built long ago.

105
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,059
Accommodation for accompanying officials

106
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,662
This Yuanhao wants to build another Wangjun

107
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,932
Helan Mountain is easy to defend but difficult to attack

108
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:46,899
perhaps

109
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,268
He really has this plan

110
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:56,836
I know you are still alive

111
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:44,584
Do not reveal my name

112
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,219
The gods in the outside world also have eyes and ears

113
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,221
Understand I understand

114
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,761
Why did you suddenly kneel down?

115
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,666
Didn't you hear what she said?

116
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,370
No one is talking in this room

117
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,371
I heard you alone

118
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,038
Talking to oneself

119
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,310
Xiaojing didn't say anything

120
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,281
did not hear it

121
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:20,786
Understood

122
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:22,655
This opportunity

123
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:23,956
Belongs only to me

124
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,594
It's a pity that you don't have this blessing

125
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:33,599
it's okay no problem

126
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,301
Just think I'm stupid

127
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,617
Qingtianzi summoned Mr. Wei

128
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:53,653
Please lead the way

129
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:25,518
Wei Sizheng

130
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:27,753
exist

131
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:29,989
We know each other

132
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:31,157
know

133
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,358
It's the dog

134
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,227
Sheep Guardian

135
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:38,264
Colluded with Liang Gewei to plot rebellion

136
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,999
Your son is here too

137
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,468
This child has been acting since he was a child

138
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,469
Out of place

139
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,738
I heard that Xingqingfu

140
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:47,840
Miracles have been reported frequently in recent days

141
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,908
Is this true?

142
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:49,875
really

143
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,511
There are sheep heads floating in the sky

144
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:53,713
What do you think

145
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,149
Is it really a miracle or man-made?

146
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,385
I guess it's people

147
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,355
I think so

148
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,025
Under the Helan Mountain

149
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,660
There are always fish that slip through the net.

150
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,261
The key is

151
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,430
These fish that slipped through the net

152
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,666
They are all friends with your son

153
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,902
You said they came to Daxia

154
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:18,738
Who will you ask for help?

155
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:21,841
I rebelled against the Song Dynasty

156
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,075
They hate me so much

157
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,110
Didn't come to me

158
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,519
I really don’t know whether I should believe you or not

159
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,253
Wei Sizheng

160
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,155
But it doesn't matter, it's not important

161
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,189
Believe it or not

162
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,092
The important thing is that the new year is approaching

163
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:41,627
before new year

164
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,162
You have to catch these fish that have slipped through the net

165
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,063
Catch it for me

166
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,198
But I don't have the power to arrest you

167
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,601
I don't care, I just want to see the result

168
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:50,269
remember

169
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,271
during the New Year

170
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:54,039
if i can't see

171
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,141
These fish that slipped through the net

172
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,442
I will kill your son

173
00:12:59,111 --> 00:12:59,879
That's it

174
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:00,946
you

175
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,681
Father and son may not have seen each other for a long time.

176
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:03,916
Have a good chat

177
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:04,850
I won't bother you

178
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,652
remember

179
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,988
Your son's life is in your hands

180
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:15,861
Daddy

181
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:21,200
father

182
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:22,802
you once said to me

183
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:24,904
The final army Changying

184
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:26,705
Weak crown surrenders to the country

185
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,175
The man defends the country regardless of life or death

186
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:31,544
Do you still remember these words?

187
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:35,147
father

188
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:37,783
I just want to ask

189
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,852
You surrendered to the enemy and treason

190
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:41,821
True or False

191
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:44,657
Fake

192
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:50,796
Vehicles and cannons are easily damaged

193
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:52,264
I can’t hide it from Yuan Hao

194
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,234
After that I was demoted and assigned

195
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:56,602
Confiscating the house

196
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,971
It's all taking advantage of the situation

197
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,842
Why send me to Lingnan?

198
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:04,977
Because it was discovered inside

199
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,547
Yuan Hao’s spy is hidden in Lingnan

200
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:10,816
Eyeliner hidden in Lingnan

201
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:13,352
Lingnan

202
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,388
Many of the criminal ministers and officials of the Song Dynasty were assigned to me

203
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,692
Although Yuan Hao was an enemy of the Song Dynasty,

204
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:21,227
but he is willing

205
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,028
Gather the people of Song Dynasty for his use

206
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,865
So this is the second bitter trick

207
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:33,339
Officials knew that Yuan Hao was murderous.

208
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,908
If he raises an army while I'm here

209
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,577
It might as well be reported to the court secretly

210
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:39,678
Be prepared early

211
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:40,613
father

212
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,915
I knew you wouldn't be treasonous

213
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,455
Shouldn't I be asking these questions?

214
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:50,456
originally

215
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,092
I should hide it from you

216
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,696
But if I hide it from you

217
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,599
How cruel to you

218
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:02,601
father

219
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,138
How can I bear it?

220
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:07,640
Don't worry, Dad.

221
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:09,708
I will never reveal this

222
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,677
Dad believes in you

223
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:15,314
You've grown up

224
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,985
Father Xingqing Mansion Divine Punishment

225
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,186
Do you know

226
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:22,855
Yuan Zhongxin did it

227
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,123
He looked for me

228
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:24,823
he's fine

229
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:26,959
Very good

230
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:30,195
father

231
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,464
You can't sell him

232
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,068
It doesn't matter whether I die or not

233
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:37,836
You can have another one, too.

234
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:38,971
father

235
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,241
won't let you die

236
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:43,442
father

237
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:49,882
Dad, please don't

238
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,340
Qing Tianzi

239
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:16,575
Finished chatting

240
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,110
How was the chat?

241
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,280
scolded me

242
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,015
It's shameful to say it's traitorous

243
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,752
Children are ignorant

244
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:27,987
I'll try to persuade him later

245
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,356
Good birds still choose trees to roost in?

246
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,424
Things about Xingqing Mansion

247
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,226
I'll give you an explanation

248
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:36,695
Okay, go down.

249
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,534
Wei Sizheng

250
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,372
Come early for the banquet tomorrow.

251
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,640
After all the fun, get down to business

252
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,470
Wei Yuan

253
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,472
In Yuan Hao's hands

254
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,241
It has been locked in the apse

255
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:28,180
Yuan Hao threatened me with his life

256
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,250
Find out the truth about the miracles in Xingqing Mansion

257
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:33,986
how much time do you have

258
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:34,620
Years ago

259
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:36,855
That's not a few days away

260
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:39,091
Yes, it's only a few days away

261
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,092
When to have a banquet

262
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:41,794
tomorrow

263
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:43,295
There's enough time

264
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,199
uncle

265
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,034
I don't know exactly

266
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,269
Why did we come to Xixia?

267
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,072
But please believe me

268
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,841
In the current situation, only Yuan Hao dies.

269
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,178
Only then can we ensure the integrity of the yamen

270
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,018
Before the time limit expires

271
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,456
I won't hand you over

272
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,239
There will be many guards at the banquet tomorrow

273
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,975
So I can only tonight

274
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:31,310
bring you in

275
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:34,680
understand

276
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:37,850
Poisoning success

277
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,984
Stand still

278
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:40,919
If there is an accident

279
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:41,920
Assassinate immediately

280
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:43,956
Where is the girl who poisoned me?

281
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,158
The queen has made arrangements

282
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:00,572
Anyway

283
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:03,041
I'm only responsible for taking you to the back hall

284
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,776
others

285
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,278
I can't control it.

286
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,516
certainly

287
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:12,618
remember

288
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,420
Open less and talk less

289
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:16,755
To avoid any flaws

290
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,092
After father's death

291
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:21,360
What are your plans

292
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,429
After the matter is completed, he will return to the Song Dynasty

293
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,298
Good

294
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:28,066
Fallen leaves return to their roots

295
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:30,669
Noriyoshi

296
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,040
Take her to the maid's house

297
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:36,341
yes

298
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:49,188
Wen Shao and Chu Niao

299
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,255
Are they okay?

300
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:55,827
died

301
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:01,300
Don't think so yet

302
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,936
at the beginning

303
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,304
They all say Brother Yuan

304
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:06,738
Death in the Ice

305
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:08,907
Aren’t you safe and sound now?

306
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:11,109
I watched them die

307
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,218
Flowers

308
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:20,819
Condolences

309
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:24,890
Start tomorrow

310
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,358
How can I help you here?

311
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:29,828
Sister Zhao said

312
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:31,897
Just pretend you don't know about this

313
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:33,832
if we lose

314
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,901
There is hope of completing the assassination

315
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:37,269
It's just you

316
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:43,675
That's what he said at the time

317
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,225
The sneaky one in the back

318
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:01,193
you know

319
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,067
Is it Yu Chiyuan?

320
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:15,874
I don't need you here

321
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,175
Then where should I go?

322
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,279
Go find those mortals

323
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:27,519
If you have something to say, say it so he can't hear you.

324
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:30,055
he can't hear

325
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:31,390
In Xixia

326
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,991
The dragon god has such magical powers

327
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:34,159
That's it

328
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:35,427
His Excellency Dragon God

329
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,230
Aren’t we talking about bestowing divine grace?

330
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,400
After Yuan Hao's death

331
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,834
I will give you eternal life

332
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,138
Thank you Dragon God

333
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,176
Could you please ask me one more question?

334
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:53,478
Is it okay to pray for a child?

335
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:01,853
no no

336
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:02,754
Don't get me wrong

337
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,589
No, I am my benefactor.

338
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:07,993
He urgently needs this kind of magical power.

339
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:13,899
Discuss later

340
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:17,436
yes

341
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:19,738
Then I'll say goodbye first

342
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:28,814
What are you asking for a child?

343
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:31,583
He thought I was the Dragon God

344
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:33,318
What do you think?

345
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:35,187
never mind

346
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:37,055
Secret Pavilion knew it right away

347
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:38,357
That guy Yuan Zhongxin

348
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,458
Can do any kind of scam

349
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,093
At that time, I loved cheating

350
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:42,194
He's not the only one

351
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:43,495
You and Mr. Wen also like to fuck

352
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:05,917
Think about that time in the Secret Pavilion

353
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,220
It seems like just yesterday

354
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:10,555
yes

355
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,192
Secret Pavilion had classes every day at that time

356
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,195
I felt tired and annoyed at first

357
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:19,998
But think about it now

358
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:23,869
It was great then

359
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:26,438
yes

360
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,861
There is no hidden truth. This person cannot be trusted.

361
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:51,696
You should be careful

362
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:20,759
Wei Sizheng

363
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:23,862
It turned out to be the Prime Minister

364
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,199
Si Zheng, please come this way

365
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:42,347
Qingtianzi said

366
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:43,682
Si Zheng and his son

367
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:46,351
Today's banquet can be shared

368
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:58,330
father

369
00:24:59,030 --> 00:24:59,865
I survive on my own

370
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:00,999
Don't hurt Qizhai

371
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,101
Qizhai assassinated Yuan Hao today

372
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,338
Yuan Hao has outstanding martial arts skills

373
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,272
How to kill?

374
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,307
And there are so many guards here

375
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:11,109
How to escape after the incident?

376
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:16,835
Mr. Yuan

377
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:18,336
why are you here

378
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:21,239
It's too noisy up there

379
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:22,741
Get some peace and quiet

380
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,343
what is this for

381
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:26,745
Life-saving

382
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:27,879
Whose life should I save?

383
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,714
You will know when you go up there

384
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:31,216
Won't you go?

385
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:46,231
Queen Arrives

386
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:18,530
Sit down, everyone.

387
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,500
The Queen Arrives

388
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,040
No Zangshi has ever seen the queen

389
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,074
Met the prince

390
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,148
They are all family members

391
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,218
Why does my sister need such a big gift?

392
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:16,054
Meet the Queen

393
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:17,222
should be respected

394
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:21,593
sit down

395
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:29,334
Everyone, please take a seat.

396
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:05,270
Kings

397
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:07,372
Everyone is here

398
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:08,473
Report to the King

399
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,908
Someone stabbed me

400
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,744
Be more detailed

401
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:14,946
There is a banquet today

402
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:16,714
There are many complicated things in the palace

403
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:17,382
I am afraid of chaos

404
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:19,050
So we arranged some more staff.

405
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,118
Be careful

406
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:20,852
result

407
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,995
What's the result?

408
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:32,397
As a result, I met a few

409
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:33,832
A boy I have never seen before

410
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:36,334
Secretly contacted the Queen and the Prince

411
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:38,870
At first, I didn’t dare to think too much.

412
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:39,971
Just sent some people

413
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:40,939
Quietly inquire

414
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:42,440
Then I learned

415
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,074
There are two people

416
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:45,076
Under the arrangement of the prince

417
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:47,879
Hiding on the beam of the banquet hall

418
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:49,814
Only then did I feel that something was wrong

419
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:50,748
Come and inform

420
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:55,420
Are you still there now?

421
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,222
It's still on the beam

422
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:59,157
The minister also sent guards

423
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:00,058
eavesdrop on conversations

424
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,227
These young men are from Song Dynasty

425
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,828
Except for the two on the beam

426
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:07,031
The queen also betrothed a girl from the Song Dynasty

427
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,700
Hidden in the passage of the apse

428
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,335
Prepare for the banquet

429
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:11,870
Kill the king with poison

430
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,388
Now that everyone is here

431
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,222
Let's have a banquet

432
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,224
Danger in the palace

433
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,360
Let's catch the assassin first.

434
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:37,762
How can we miss the wine and meat?

435
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,797
I'm going to a banquet

436
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:41,299
Go and kill the girl who poisoned her

437
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,133
Catch it for me

438
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:42,700
yes

439
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:48,940
The king arrives

440
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,233
No one is in the Prime Minister's house

441
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:18,870
Why is there no one?

442
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,104
Walk

443
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,842
Okay, no more time wasting

444
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:26,878
Serve wine and have a banquet

445
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:09,387
This is getting cold feet

446
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:12,857
The entire apse area

447
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:14,058
Search carefully

448
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:14,859
yes

449
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,812
Where have people gone?

450
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:42,620
Who are you?

451
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:46,691
In fact, if the Prime Minister suffers a loss, he will suffer a loss.

452
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:50,828
Never seen who I am

453
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:54,232
are you still thinking

454
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:55,733
Where did Xiaojing go?

455
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:58,069
You are also a Song

456
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:01,105
Don't misunderstand you and I are allies

457
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,874
I saved your companion's life

458
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:04,242
Actually we have thought about it

459
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,477
Why did you want to kill Yuan Hao?

460
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:07,745
that's because of me

461
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:09,280
Putting aside those kindnesses, let’s not talk about them

462
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:11,215
Yuan Hao is dead

463
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,350
what's in it for you

464
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,118
the answer is

465
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,120
No

466
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,755
Don’t kill Yuan Hao

467
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,557
What should I do to save you?

468
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,625
Yeah, what are you going to do to save us?

469
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:21,559
So we just

470
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,693
Changed my mind

471
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:25,296
Prime Minister and your sister

472
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:26,497
what do you want

473
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,332
And for these

474
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:29,901
what will do

475
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,306
Just had a baby

476
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,941
Another son

477
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:38,609
Mother

478
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,579
But there are still hidden dangers

479
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:42,814
Why

480
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,216
Because of the position of the Xixia Prince

481
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:47,251
Someone is already sitting

482
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,996
I sincerely wish my father happiness, longevity and health

483
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:00,298
never disaster

484
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,992
The queen doesn't have to do the work herself

485
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,230
We are all a family

486
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,866
This is what I should do

487
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,268
Why are you so polite?

488
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,504
Only the prince can be deposed

489
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,139
My sister’s son’s talent

490
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,173
Become the new prince

491
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:43,975
Then if you want to depose the prince

492
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,577
We must let Brother Ning Ling

493
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:47,879
And Queen Yeli

494
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,280
ruined

495
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,115
This is what you want

496
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:53,851
Prime Minister

497
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:56,354
You might as well think about it

498
00:35:57,388 --> 00:35:58,422
Where did Xiaojing go?

499
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:00,191
a reminder

500
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:03,027
Or poison

501
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:12,303
No, no, no

502
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:13,437
Not so vicious

503
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:14,472
After all, I still won’t

504
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:15,373
Attack children

505
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:46,037
Just always be wary of me

506
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:48,272
This is so chilling

507
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:50,474
on this banquet

508
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,176
No one will poison me anymore

509
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:53,978
The poison still has to be administered

510
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:00,518
Queen

511
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:02,954
Just heard

512
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:04,922
There is an assassin hiding in this hall

513
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,459
How about I settle this matter first?

514
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:10,228
So as not to drink later

515
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,295
lost interest

516
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,174
Take advantage of the situation

517
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,945
Your people are not on the beam either

518
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:02,513
How dare you?

519
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,881
Prime Minister

520
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:04,949
The clear path you pointed to

521
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,450
We really don't dare to leave

522
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:21,899
This is

523
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:55,199
fine

524
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:58,135
It seems the rumors are wrong

525
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,571
Everybody, get up and keep drinking

526
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:03,140
Don't let this little thing spoil your mood

527
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:13,317
your accomplice

528
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,786
Not above the palace at all

529
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:16,554
exist

530
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:18,656
But not entirely

531
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:19,557
you

532
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,425
What are you talking about? You really are

533
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,601
Chief

534
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:32,636
Xue Ying

535
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:33,571
why are you here

536
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:36,374
Waiting to see Yuan Hao die

537
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:39,543
You are the one who hung the chain

538
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,311
Made by Wang Kuan

539
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,552
This side corridor is locked

540
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:49,620
how did you get in

541
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:51,956
Don't make fun of me

542
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:52,857
There is a cliff outside

543
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:53,791
how did you get in

544
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:55,393
What to do if someone finds out

545
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:56,560
What's the meaning

546
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,395
Someone set a trap

547
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:58,896
We'll wait outside the trap

548
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:00,297
Advance, attack, retreat and defend

549
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:01,832
Although I don’t understand

550
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:03,267
Will you take action later?

551
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:04,135
possible

552
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:05,603
That's good

553
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:09,340
Don't kill me anymore

554
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,674
The Prime Minister is anxious to death

555
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:11,709
Not that anxious

556
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:16,180
That’s it

557
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:17,681
In fact, it means the same thing

558
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:19,550
Let bygones be bygones

559
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:21,919
We can still cooperate

560
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:23,154
What's the cooperation?

561
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:26,090
What do you think, Prime Minister?

562
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:27,224
Brother Ning Ling is one

563
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:28,058
what kind of person

564
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,162
Not as brave as Qing Tianzi

565
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:32,863
Cruel but cruel

566
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:35,800
What do you think

567
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:37,668
If Brother Ning Ling takes power

568
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:39,370
people like us

569
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,272
Can you leave Xixia alive?

570
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:42,339
actually

571
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,642
Let me tell you something from my heart

572
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,745
What does it have to do with me whether you die or not?

573
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,613
What if Yuan Hao died?

574
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:51,315
Brother Ning Ling takes over

575
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,350
Prime Minister and your sister

576
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:55,786
what will be the result

577
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:28,953
The matter of folk unearthed stone tablets

578
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:30,421
Return to the divination garden to take care of it

579
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:35,426
You read it to me

580
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:36,961
What is written on the stone tablet?

581
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:37,895
above this

582
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:39,630
They are all disobedient words

583
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:41,098
I dare not

584
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:43,667
taboo for the venerable

585
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:45,069
Loyalty can be learned

586
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:48,472
Shiboyuan recently

587
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:50,040
Contribution to calming the people

588
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:51,642
Wine should be given

589
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:54,345
Come

590
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:57,314
Xie Qingtianzi

591
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:20,771
Alcohol is highly toxic

592
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:22,439
There is a stone tablet on the beam

593
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:24,775
It seems there is really an assassin

594
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:27,578
What does the queen think?

595
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:29,079
Assassin Vicious

596
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,916
Please also ask Qingtianzi to avoid

597
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:33,717
hide

598
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,352
Then kill them

599
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:36,387
Otherwise it'll be fine

600
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:39,156
I'm afraid it's hard to find.

601
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:41,091
Still need to look for it

602
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:44,295
I let them come out on their own

603
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,236
I'll kill him now

604
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,304
Don't be Qing Tianzi

605
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,706
It's up to you whether to save me or not.

606
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,875
Calm the wrath of the blue emperor

607
00:42:58,742 --> 00:42:59,877
Qing Tianzi

608
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:02,346
Please don't kill my son

609
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:03,280
Pull it down

610
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:03,948
father

611
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:04,548
Qing Tianzi

612
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:06,550
Don't kill my son

613
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:07,918
father

614
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,219
father

615
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,321
Save Yanei

616
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:11,021
Just wait for this sentence

617
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:13,190
son

618
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,391
Daddy

619
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:16,026
You can't kill my son

620
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:17,861
You can't kill my son

621
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:32,042
Yanei

622
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:56,400
Go fast
