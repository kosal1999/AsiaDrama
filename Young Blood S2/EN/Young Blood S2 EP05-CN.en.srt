1
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:47,907
so

2
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,643
Liang Zhu is the stone you threw

3
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,313
How can he find a way out?

4
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,247
No

5
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,316
Your men

6
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,785
It's the stone that's thrown

7
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,453
I guess

8
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:01,654
Your men

9
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:02,355
Should follow now

10
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:03,656
Coach Liang, right?

11
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:08,795
Your Majesty’s Approval for Privy Council Affairs

12
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,164
Who else in the world can break the situation?

13
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:12,365
Saw my husband

14
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:14,200
We are following the Xuanwu Army in the capital.

15
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,235
Liang Zhu comes

16
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:16,769
Liang Zhu went to Qizhai

17
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,905
You may have a plan to come here now

18
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:20,807
Sir, please pay attention

19
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:22,709
Xianggong

20
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:24,711
We are really Lu Nanshan’s subordinates

21
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,447
Lu Nanshan, deputy commissioner of the Privy Council

22
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,086
Then drive people out

23
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:34,187
Word spread

24
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:36,089
Now that there's been a fuss

25
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,191
Just make things clear

26
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:46,366
Get up

27
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:47,634
Xie Xianggong

28
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,639
Someone just entered the backyard

29
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:54,474
yes

30
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,209
Warrant from Xianggong's Mansion for visitors

31
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,844
He only said that he was ordered to inspect the carriage.

32
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:58,945
This happens every day

33
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,280
Just let him come in and do some work

34
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:01,848
That person is Liang Zhu

35
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:03,516
Find people

36
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:04,517
yes

37
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,090
Lu Zhangyuan sent greetings to the Prime Minister

38
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,526
Mr. Ling has returned to Kaifeng

39
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,894
Please rest assured, Mr.

40
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,696
Wang is only involved in political affairs

41
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,964
Second rank official position

42
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:19,866
I dare not say the word "husband"

43
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,269
Sir, you are too modest

44
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,904
No one in the world knows

45
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:27,040
It is the prime minister's right to participate in political affairs

46
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,608
Now the Song Dynasty is peaceful and peaceful

47
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,443
It was all done by Mr. Wang alone.

48
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,412
It can be said that the Song Dynasty was lucky

49
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:33,713
How can it be considered as one person's strength?

50
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:35,715
Can be considered

51
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:40,787
it's him

52
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,225
Liangzhu, the capital of Xuanwu Army

53
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:46,893
I’ve met Mr. Xianggong

54
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,127
why did you come here

55
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:50,363
Your Majesty asked me to bring you a letter

56
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:51,197
Bring the letter

57
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:52,165
The son said

58
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:53,233
this letter

59
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,735
Want me to read it aloud to you in person?

60
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,737
No need to bring it over

61
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,239
Xianggong

62
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,376
You'd better listen to it

63
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:05,878
Read it

64
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:12,685
Trouble Coach Liang

65
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:13,720
this letter

66
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,488
Please read it out loud then

67
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:16,923
It's that simple

68
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:23,963
The one who bows down to me, my father,

69
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,465
Although my son is stupid

70
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,000
But I also know how to be a human being

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,368
Self-respecting and unconventional

72
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:29,636
Don’t be righteous within yourself

73
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,971
During the turbulent times of the Song Dynasty

74
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,840
The son threw himself into the Secret Pavilion

75
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,208
Just want to be a torch

76
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,843
In the gloomy place

77
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,811
Shine a ray of skylight

78
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:40,480
Qizhai was established

79
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,315
Although he has no achievements in the world

80
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:43,549
But with a clear conscience

81
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:44,851
I wait

82
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,753
Once in prison

83
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,488
Once surrounded by enemies

84
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,492
The line between life and death has not stopped

85
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:55,628
What Qizhai did

86
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,696
The heart of desire

87
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:57,964
Nothing but worthy of others

88
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,065
Not afraid of God

89
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,634
most critical time

90
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:02,669
My Heart

91
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,004
No worries

92
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,573
This life has been devoted to the Song Dynasty

93
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,075
You should sweat your heart out

94
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,010
Enter China again in the next life

95
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:12,345
Narrow escape

96
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,081
without regrets

97
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:17,116
Everyone in Qizhai

98
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:19,319
All like this

99
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,287
Prince Wang Kuan

100
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,490
Crying blood and stopping one's head

101
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:28,695
Such a boy

102
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,230
If you are still suspected by your own family,

103
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,000
What else is there to say?

104
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:48,081
Write to him

105
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:07,800
official

106
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,535
Kaifeng city

107
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,071
There is a person who is higher than my father

108
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,072
Who are you talking about

109
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:16,209
Mingdao 2nd year

110
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:17,777
After the officialdom is abolished, you know, right?

111
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,747
Why did you mention this matter?

112
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:21,948
The first year of Jingyou

113
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,050
The official family thought about establishing another queen

114
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:25,685
I know

115
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,086
The current Queen Cao?

116
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:28,654
At that time, His Majesty was interested in

117
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:29,789
Shouzhou Chen family

118
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,491
But the other party has a low status

119
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,692
The ministers advised and admonished

120
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,293
Finally let it go

121
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,629
Chen's father is a tea merchant

122
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,598
Bought the official position of city envoy

123
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:40,666
Officials are generous and affectionate

124
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,568
Although Chen did not enter the palace,

125
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,270
But it has never been forgotten by the officials

126
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:45,772
How do you know this?

127
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:46,873
Secret meetings between officials and their families outside the palace

128
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,074
It's all arranged by my father

129
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,675
I know it, of course.

130
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:51,411
Xiaolu Zhangyuan

131
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:52,879
do you know

132
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:54,614
Today is such a coincidence

133
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,149
Just in time

134
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,454
You are so brave

135
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,077
Dean

136
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,917
Liang Zhu entered the courtyard of a tea merchant

137
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:32,752
I also followed in

138
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:35,788
Then Mr. Wang came

139
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,124
The officials are also there

140
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:41,227
Dean

141
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,296
The officials have spoken

142
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,764
What did you say

143
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,868
Calculation

144
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:49,735
explain

145
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:50,670
Oral admonition

146
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:55,441
Official

147
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:57,510
Oral advice to you

148
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,747
Official oral instructions

149
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:02,748
You have to

150
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:14,727
Since the establishment of Qizhai

151
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,562
Although the behavior is absurd

152
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,065
But after all, young and energetic

153
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,066
Loyalty can be learned

154
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,667
No need for house arrest anymore

155
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:23,669
Let them do things

156
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:28,374
Who would have thought that the official family would be there?

157
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,548
What a Wang Kuan

158
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,083
no

159
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:38,951
I think it’s wrong

160
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,254
This official had a private meeting with the Chen family

161
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,588
Wang Kuan, you got him out

162
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:43,456
What if the official family

163
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:44,524
suddenly become angry

164
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,292
Then our brains are gone?

165
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:47,760
The official is kind-hearted

166
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:49,929
What if you are suddenly unkind?

167
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:51,297
Don't worry

168
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,932
My father is involved in political affairs

169
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:53,666
Officials won't kill me

170
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:56,936
What about us?

171
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:02,808
Based on the relationship between Xiaojing and me

172
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,076
Of course she's fine

173
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:09,248
Wang Kuanna

174
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:10,950
It's still too late

175
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,951
Xiao Xue and I are looking for your father

176
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:12,885
Become a foster father

177
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,354
That's okay too

178
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,890
An urgent and helpless act

179
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:19,358
What about the future

180
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,927
Just change your name to Wang Ying

181
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:22,528
I'll call it

182
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:23,529
Wang Yuan

183
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,577
You can go

184
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:40,146
There is a purpose

185
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,518
You are so brave

186
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,125
This is it

187
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,994
Even if the government is kind-hearted

188
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:56,729
What if we don't care about this little thing?

189
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:58,631
Lu Nanshan captures Yuan Zhongxin

190
00:09:58,631 --> 00:09:59,632
was supported by the Privy Council

191
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,367
And my father is involved in political affairs

192
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:03,736
My father and the Privy Council are working together

193
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,071
The officials don’t know

194
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:06,272
what would he think

195
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,274
What if the officials know?

196
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,611
The Yuan family disappeared

197
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,645
Before the case is settled

198
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:13,846
Who will inform the officials?

199
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:15,448
Unsolved troubles

200
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,949
It’s always a matter of incompetence

201
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,117
Will report back after resolution

202
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,385
That is to make a great contribution

203
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,053
The order before and after is correct

204
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:51,717
them

205
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,919
I'm punishing you again

206
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,588
I thought you would be the first

207
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:56,589
Do it to me

208
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,724
Beat him until he can't resist

209
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,226
Not interested in

210
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,096
Didn’t you make a move when we first met?

211
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,765
I was angry

212
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,034
My colleagues are all taken advantage of by your Yuan family

213
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:08,934
Killed

214
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:09,835
understand

215
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:11,904
So I took you

216
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:13,005
when dizzy

217
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,373
And put you on the grass

218
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,208
Let you lie down comfortably

219
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,209
calm down

220
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:19,478
I was careless.

221
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,047
honestly

222
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,315
It's no use catching me

223
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,352
The Yuan family won't come

224
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,056
Don’t speak too absolutely

225
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,124
blood is thicker than water

226
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:37,096
Where are Wang Kuan and the others?

227
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:39,799
Forget it

228
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,336
That kid is too brave

229
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:45,905
Alarmed the officials

230
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,307
Now

231
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:49,642
Fish returns to the sea

232
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,043
Break free from the cage

233
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:11,731
Your home is quite stylish

234
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:13,332
It looks better than mine

235
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:14,567
good

236
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,136
I'm almost lost

237
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,506
It doesn’t matter if I’m homeless

238
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:21,774
Why did you come to Wang Kuan's house?

239
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,008
Afraid of causing trouble to the family

240
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:24,610
Hello, sir

241
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:33,252
Our Dad

242
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,366
what does it mean

243
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:49,268
Should we go?

244
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,035
Say hello

245
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:54,073
Take three of them

246
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,808
Take me to the yard where I studied when I was young

247
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:56,809
Arrange accommodation for each

248
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:58,744
how about you

249
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:00,412
I'll come as soon as I go

250
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:03,516
don’t worry

251
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,160
You say

252
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,728
This father and son meet again after a long separation

253
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,363
Will you hold your head and cry?

254
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,232
Three of you, please come with me.

255
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,817
Why don't you tie it so tightly?

256
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,185
I drink it myself

257
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:40,553
Afraid you'll run away

258
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:43,489
I already said that

259
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:44,156
I

260
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,391
No running

261
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:46,592
You don't run

262
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:48,928
Plan to stay here forever

263
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,032
Not long

264
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:54,767
how

265
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,969
Thinking that Wang Kuan and others will come to rescue you

266
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:58,838
Where is Zhao Jian?

267
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:00,206
There's a wake

268
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,974
Just give up.

269
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,476
She tied you up and handed you over

270
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,412
I've made it clear that I don't want to talk to you.

271
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,416
You Qizhai

272
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,685
How did it come together?

273
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,922
to be honest

274
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:21,327
It was Zhao Jian who forcibly captured me.

275
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,394
Then what

276
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,230
Then these idiots

277
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:26,966
Just drag me into the ditch

278
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:30,569
You know the most fatal thing

279
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:31,470
What is it?

280
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:32,972
What

281
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:34,006
follow them

282
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,674
We've been together for a long time

283
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,878
I've become as stupid as them

284
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:40,479
How to call stupid

285
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,082
Just believe

286
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:46,685
Good in the Heart

287
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:50,890
believe

288
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,626
This world still has meaning

289
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,464
I believe it’s better to be together than alone

290
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:00,132
Is there anything wrong

291
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,667
if a person

292
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,204
I have been involved in intrigues and deceptions since I was a child.

293
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,372
Come out after being beaten and beaten

294
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:07,473
he will know

295
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:09,808
These things

296
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:11,744
How childish is that?

297
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,544
How stupid

298
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:15,814
But you still believed it

299
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:19,785
I've become stupid too

300
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,321
So joined them

301
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:24,156
Do you regret it?

302
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,932
have you ever thought about

303
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,200
You may live a lifetime

304
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,669
I can't live without this prison.

305
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,705
I can no longer see the outside world

306
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,808
Your companions are helpless

307
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,677
No one can get you out

308
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:46,445
If it weren't for you and them

309
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,413
Getting too close

310
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,548
Maybe it won't be today

311
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:50,950
Maybe

312
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:54,887
even so

313
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:56,689
No regrets

314
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:03,963
never regret

315
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,932
you should regret

316
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,267
What do you regret?

317
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:09,468
know these people

318
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,569
You said Qizhai

319
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:12,771
you are a scholar

320
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,107
There should be a bright future

321
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,308
where are they

322
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,744
Who are they?

323
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,113
for these people

324
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,414
You plan to

325
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:23,682
The fate of the Wang family

326
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:24,917
Are you all on board?

327
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:35,627
Why did you come around in a circle to get here?

328
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:36,829
The master said

329
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,130
I want you to listen

330
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,466
The so-called Qizhai

331
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,968
They are all people who act ridiculously

332
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,771
Then Zhao Jian is still a royal relative

333
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,873
A bit like a lady

334
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:48,640
nothing

335
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,776
Zhao Jian looks like Zhao Jian

336
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:52,444
Why be the same as others

337
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:53,479
a princess

338
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,881
With someone like Yuan Zhongxin

339
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:56,815
Come together

340
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:57,950
They match each other very well

341
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,486
You also know about the Yuan family

342
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,788
Yuan Zhongxin is finished

343
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,094
Can you let me see him?

344
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:10,529
What's the use of meeting each other?

345
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:12,364
Or

346
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,266
You want to find the location of the prison

347
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,801
Find a chance to rescue him

348
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:18,704
Who else

349
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:20,606
Xue Ying

350
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,509
A son of a military family

351
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,210
Afraid of even reading the sages’ books

352
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,311
Haven't read it yet

353
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,881
The words engraved on the back of his hand

354
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,116
You may not be able to wash it off in this life

355
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:33,786
Except for brute force

356
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:34,686
What else can he do?

357
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:39,158
Don’t you have anything to say?

358
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,292
You finish first

359
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:41,794
Who is left

360
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,095
Scenery in Yanei

361
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:45,431
Wei Yuan

362
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,967
Unlearned, unskilled and stubborn

363
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,569
The character is also low

364
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:51,970
People like him

365
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,073
How can I be with you?

366
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,078
Uncle is right

367
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,314
The last Pei Jing

368
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:06,118
Let's go and stop listening.

369
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:19,164
Look at the signature first

370
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:28,474
Han Duanzhang

371
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,908
Let’s see who we write to

372
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,278
Pei Xuan

373
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:34,146
Pei Xuan

374
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:35,747
My brother

375
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:38,884
Still remember Han Duanzhang

376
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:39,918
Is this the name?

377
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:42,187
Remember

378
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,690
The Liao people killed his father

379
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,424
Dayanlin

380
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,292
Killed all his relatives

381
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,762
Han Duanzhang, Superintendent of Tiyin in the Great Liao Dynasty

382
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,332
Bohai Survivor Liao Kingdom Secret Agent

383
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,033
Want to provoke war between Song and Liao

384
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:58,170
Long before Han Duanzhang went to Beijing

385
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,506
The Pei family had correspondence with him

386
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:02,875
See for yourself

387
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,077
The letter made it very clear

388
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,147
The Pei family already knew about Han Duanzhang

389
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,448
Have revenge

390
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,517
What do you think this means?

391
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:20,359
The Pei family and Han may be accomplices

392
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,631
I do not know

393
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:27,666
Of course we believe you

394
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,667
Have you met Han Duanzhang?

395
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:31,436
seen

396
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,905
Pei Jing was also there at that time

397
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:33,672
That's right

398
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:35,774
Han Duanzhang once blocked others

399
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:36,875
Attack Xiaojing

400
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:37,910
Is this true?

401
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,245
Died

402
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,252
Don't hurt innocent people

403
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:51,523
have

404
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,824
why not kill her

405
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,194
Just because they are both Bohai people

406
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:56,828
That's what I just said

407
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:58,363
They were accomplices

408
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:01,266
Where did the letter come from?

409
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,267
Found out

410
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,268
Where are the Pei family?

411
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,437
Didn't catch them

412
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:06,872
It's also for your accomplices

413
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,173
Save some face

414
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:09,975
Why did you think of searching the Pei family?

415
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:14,046
Because of the relationship between Xiaojing and me

416
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,451
This letter is not a fake after all

417
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:20,552
a letter

418
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:21,954
How can we convict

419
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,691
Pei Jing is of Bohai bloodline

420
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:27,526
Another old case with Han Broken Chapter

421
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:28,627
unclear

422
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,495
What is your identity?

423
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:33,765
You are my royal son.

424
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:35,801
Both character and knowledge are of the highest quality

425
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:36,802
Now

426
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,471
Even the officials know your name

427
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,107
Your life has unlimited potential

428
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,243
A woman like Pei Jing

429
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,712
How can I be worthy of you

430
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:01,193
Three

431
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:02,694
I've heard everything I need to hear.

432
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:03,629
please

433
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:05,030
where to

434
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,832
Of course I will settle you down

435
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:07,766
thank you

436
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:08,967
please

437
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:26,652
Can you give me this letter?

438
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:28,053
You keep it

439
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:29,721
You said so much

440
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,690
what do you want me to do

441
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,325
with your wisdom

442
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,693
Will you not understand?

443
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:35,894
I still want to ask

444
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,564
You were with them

445
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:41,400
Not from the same world

446
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,069
Released

447
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:45,570
Let go of friends

448
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:47,406
Teenager's friend

449
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,274
How many people can stay the same with each other?

450
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,843
Mostly parting ways

451
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:53,278
There is always someone who goes with you all the way

452
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:56,548
Wang Kuan

453
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,485
What is called growth as a person walks in the world

454
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,320
sometimes

455
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,089
Just learn to give up

456
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:05,157
What to give up

457
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:06,925
past self

458
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,264
Don’t let go of your past self

459
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:13,665
How can I cope with this world?

460
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,000
Frost Sword

461
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,668
Wakubun Wakuwa

462
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,170
The world is changing

463
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,805
Dynasties also changed

464
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,206
What's more, people

465
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,009
Kuan'er

466
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,879
Everyone has their youth

467
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:29,848
Juvenile

468
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,150
Sometimes it's a sweet dream

469
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:35,554
Now I have woken up from my dream

470
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,456
It's time for you to grow up too

471
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,524
the father i know

472
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:41,626
All human beings

473
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:43,328
will eventually change

474
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:47,199
I hope you understand

475
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:49,067
maybe one day

476
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,370
I will betray who I am now

477
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,405
Live in a way that you hate

478
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,307
but not now

479
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,010
Of course people change

480
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:01,346
But have some thoughts

481
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:02,214
have some persistence

482
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,115
should not waver

483
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,117
if you grow up

484
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,319
Just kill yesterday's self

485
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:08,920
Abandon the light in your heart

486
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,690
Then I would rather spend my life

487
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:13,959
always young

488
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,264
You make me very disappointed

489
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:20,165
me too

490
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,336
What's the point of your insistence?

491
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:25,871
Persistence is meaning in itself

492
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,317
See how filial you are

493
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:41,486
I don’t even want to leave

494
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:44,322
You can't leave either

495
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,358
Now there are three floors inside and three floors outside.

496
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:47,893
There are people trampling outside

497
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,728
They were all scared by you

498
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:51,496
learn from mistakes

499
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,165
I'll know later

500
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:54,866
Zhao Jian ties you up

501
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:56,468
You don't hate her

502
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:57,969
In this life

503
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:00,172
You will always meet someone special

504
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,106
What's special

505
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,975
No matter what she does to you

506
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:07,345
You won't blame her or hate her

507
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,047
are you willing to do it for her

508
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:10,148
Climb all the mountains

509
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:12,884
Even willing to do it for her

510
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:14,319
Give your life

511
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:25,964
That's not stupid.

512
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:27,732
And you

513
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,134
in life

514
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:30,735
Is there such a special person?

515
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:33,305
indeed there is one

516
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,506
How far has it developed?

517
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,874
What step

518
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:38,176
Have you ever held hands?

519
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:39,277
Have you made an appointment?

520
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,280
Which hand do you hold and what is your marriage?

521
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:43,949
The one I'm talking about

522
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:45,784
He is an upright man

523
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,225
It's not what you think

524
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,094
The one I'm talking about is my benefactor

525
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:58,897
no matter what he does to me

526
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,399
I won't blame him or hate him

527
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:04,402
Even willing to cross mountains and ridges for him

528
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:06,404
Killing and stealing goods

529
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:07,639
even

530
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:08,874
Give your life

531
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:14,813
Roughly the same

532
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,081
Who?

533
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:18,316
You will know later

534
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:19,384
I will know later

535
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:20,552
Looks like I know him

536
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:23,488
What nonsense are you talking about?

537
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:24,689
What did I say

538
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:25,657
what did you say

539
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,159
My benefactor did it to me

540
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,227
cruel training

541
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:30,695
Not from my mouth

542
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:31,496
Reveal secrets

543
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:33,431
underwent brutal training

544
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:34,399
Could it be

545
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,801
Lu Nanshan Bar

546
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:37,869
How can that be?

547
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,806
Isn’t it the current head of the Secret Pavilion?

548
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:43,408
Lu Nanshan?

549
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,045
It looks like it is indeed Lu Nanshan

550
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,916
Stop guessing

551
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,212
How about it

552
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:23,214
How about what

553
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:25,417
The rooms are cleaned

554
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:26,985
Scanned

555
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:28,920
All good

556
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:31,489
Your yard is not bad either

557
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:35,727
these books

558
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:37,696
You read them all when you were a child

559
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:40,465
That's not bad

560
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:42,167
No wonder he is knowledgeable

561
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:52,844
My dad gave it to me

562
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:54,312
Talk about your home

563
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,348
I had exchanged letters with Han Duanzhang

564
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:08,126
Just show it to Xiao Jing directly.

565
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,094
Why not?

566
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:10,562
normal person

567
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,197
Why don't you just keep it a secret for now?

568
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,031
No need

569
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,033
If you have something to say, you should be honest

570
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,468
hide concealment

571
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,736
It will only breed suspicion

572
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,071
The so-called misunderstanding between people

573
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,573
Often this arises from

574
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:24,275
maybe it's true

575
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:26,478
Small Scene

576
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,147
Think about it carefully before speaking

577
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:35,286
There's a date on this letter

578
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:37,956
Think back to that time

579
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,358
My family does often meet with people

580
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:41,693
There is correspondence

581
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,596
And help deliver letters

582
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:46,798
They are all caravans heading north to Liao.

583
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:48,867
I asked my dad at that time

584
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,069
He said he was in contact with his fellow tribesmen

585
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,270
But never said his name

586
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:55,240
Looking at it now

587
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:59,277
It should be Han Duanzhang

588
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:00,345
this

589
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:01,946
How did they know each other?

590
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:02,847
Han Duanzhang ah

591
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:05,950
I don’t know that either.

592
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:07,786
But this matter

593
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:08,687
You don’t have to do this either

594
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:09,587
Admit it honestly

595
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:11,289
Brother Wang treats me with sincerity

596
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:14,759
I don’t have to lie

597
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:17,962
What did I say

598
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:19,464
Did I just meet you?

599
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:20,865
Let's just say they are a perfect match.

600
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:21,800
No

601
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,068
You take care of others as soon as you meet them

602
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:24,002
Call me little lady

603
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,371
Why are you talking about this?

604
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:27,505
I also want to be honest

605
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,873
Why don't you shut up?

606
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,278
My dad said something to me

607
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:34,612
Generally

608
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:36,715
Just say that you are all cunning friends.

609
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,316
You want me to cut off contact with you

610
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:46,891
to be honest

611
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:48,993
actually

612
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:50,995
we all heard it

613
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:53,465
Yeah

614
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:58,169
My father arranged for you to listen

615
00:28:58,870 --> 00:28:59,671
if not

616
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:08,546
Xue Ying

617
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:11,950
In addition to force, you also have courage

618
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,284
can be your friend

619
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:14,853
it's my honour

620
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:19,557
me too

621
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:24,496
Small Scene

622
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:27,465
My father will not marry you

623
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:29,367
What

624
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:32,003
I am the one who will marry you

625
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,005
So what does he think of you?

626
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:35,306
Doesn't matter

627
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:40,512
what about me

628
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,481
no no

629
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:45,550
Don't think about the previous sentence

630
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,551
I mean

631
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,053
Your father also said that I am uneducated and have no skills.

632
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:50,588
What are you going to tell me?

633
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:52,690
My dad is right

634
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:54,893
Wang Kuan

635
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,162
You don't have to be so straightforward

636
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:58,496
I don't lie

637
00:29:58,496 --> 00:29:59,597
Then you don’t have to say it

638
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:00,398
you asked

639
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:02,734
Then I was wrong

640
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:03,601
It doesn't matter

641
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:04,803
what

642
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,171
You start to forgive me

643
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:08,373
You are indeed ignorant

644
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:09,240
naughty

645
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,409
But to say you have low moral character

646
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:12,911
absolutely wrong

647
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,146
Yanei

648
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:17,015
You have a pure heart

649
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:18,349
Almost Tao

650
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:22,487
Although I didn’t understand

651
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,490
But you should be complimenting me, right?

652
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,991
I just read too few books

653
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:29,294
No need to add the last sentence

654
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,531
I won't leave you

655
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:34,599
Isn't that nonsense?

656
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:36,668
Our seven fasts are one body

657
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:41,673
Let's all settle in first

658
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:43,074
Small Scene

659
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:45,176
Come with me later

660
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,411
where to

661
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:47,679
Go to your house

662
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,648
Are you so direct?

663
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:51,449
good

664
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:53,685
You agreed now

665
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,554
Why do you talk so much about other people's affairs?

666
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,492
Fortunately, Xiao Jing fell in love with Wang Kuan

667
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:02,994
What if Xiao Jing was

668
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:03,895
It's me

669
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:05,496
I can't stand it

670
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:06,664
Such a straightforward person

671
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:07,565
okay

672
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:08,466
No one likes you

673
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:09,067
Walk

674
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:10,735
What do you know

675
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:12,003
Do you know Bashai Chuniao?

676
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,104
Do you know what she thinks?

677
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:15,807
never mind

678
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:17,108
With a rigid person like you

679
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:18,243
It doesn't make sense

680
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:31,456
Everything is mine

681
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:35,960
Go a little further

682
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,495
We're almost there after passing Jieshen Lane

683
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:39,464
Not urgent

684
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:41,833
Walk Slowly

685
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:47,238
Your home is not far from Jieshen Lane

686
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:48,806
yes

687
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:50,408
I can be considered around that area

688
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:50,975
grown up

689
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:53,511
Remember Jieshen Lane

690
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:54,879
There seem to be more gold and silver shops

691
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:57,715
My parents also did that business

692
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,285
But later I got into debt

693
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:01,719
All paid off

694
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,720
Returned

695
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,123
It was the manager who helped pay it off.

696
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,091
Lu Zhangyuan

697
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:10,228
Mr. Lu is familiar with your parents

698
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:11,963
Not really

699
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:13,364
At that time, Lu Zhangyuan

700
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:15,133
I need my Bohai identity

701
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,067
Go north to Liao

702
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:17,335
My parents took me

703
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:18,403
Sent to the Secret Pavilion

704
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,071
The governor settled the debt

705
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:23,474
Isn't this just selling you?

706
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:25,009
There's nothing we can do

707
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:29,647
Where's your brother?

708
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:31,282
My parents asked the dean

709
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:31,916
Gave him a patch

710
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,251
The vacancy of the right guard

711
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:36,688
Later, it seemed that I was in the Planning Department of Beijing North

712
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:37,755
Sending

713
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:39,724
It's what you got in exchange for it.

714
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:44,195
How long has it been since you last seen them?

715
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,735
After entering the secret pavilion

716
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,371
Not seen much anymore

717
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:55,907
they never came to see you

718
00:32:58,242 --> 00:32:59,210
They are also busy

719
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:03,748
It's okay, Brother Wang

720
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:04,749
Do not be angry

721
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:08,252
What can I do for my family?

722
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:09,387
it's always good

723
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:10,555
Moreover

724
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,390
How nice it is to be in the secret pavilion

725
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,092
I also met you

726
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,213
Let's go

727
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:36,748
Keep leading the way

728
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:45,957
Xiao Xue

729
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:47,392
Xiao Xue Xiao Xue

730
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:49,127
What's wrong

731
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:51,195
Go out for a walk

732
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:52,096
Something

733
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,998
Aren’t we going to help Yuan Zhongxin?

734
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:55,400
yes

735
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,734
Then you have to tell the chief.

736
00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:58,469
Right

737
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,204
Tell us about the current situation

738
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,106
Also discuss what to do next

739
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:03,908
Let me tell you

740
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,276
To save Yuan Zhongxin

741
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:06,811
The chief is definitely interested

742
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:08,679
But Lu Nanshan didn’t say

743
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:09,814
Before the chief, Yuan Zhongxin

744
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:10,681
Handed it over

745
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:12,617
Can you believe this?

746
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:14,318
I bet you

747
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,087
If this is true

748
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,655
I'll take my head off and play with it for you

749
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:20,358
What's so funny about your head?

750
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:22,794
Just treat it as a collection

751
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:23,961
Really

752
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:26,030
Let me tell you

753
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,799
Just Zhaizhang and Yuan Zhongxin

754
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:29,567
impossible

755
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:31,335
Go Go Go

756
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,850
Why don't you close your eyes and sleep?

757
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:50,755
What if someone saves you?

758
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,490
Maybe for colleagues

759
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:53,558
chance for revenge

760
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,193
Quite persistent

761
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:57,895
When you went to Yuan's house

762
00:34:57,895 --> 00:34:59,130
How did you get ambushed?

763
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,431
Ordered to search your home

764
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:03,134
After arriving, the house was empty.

765
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:04,869
The whole clan is gone

766
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,270
And after that

767
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:08,473
After that, I searched at Yuan’s house.

768
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,075
Let's see if there are any clues

769
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:13,811
Then they were ambushed

770
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:15,113
That's how it goes

771
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:17,315
The Yuan family is gone.

772
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,317
Obviously someone tipped off the news

773
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:20,485
Left early

774
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:23,287
How many of your group were injured or killed?

775
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:24,655
Except me

776
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,524
All died

777
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:27,725
Talk about it in detail

778
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:29,827
Didn’t you say everything?

779
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:31,095
Search your home

780
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:34,465
When you are ambushed

781
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:35,566
Are they all together?

782
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:37,802
That's not the case

783
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,404
Searched separately

784
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:41,472
But not far away

785
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,040
first

786
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:45,276
Xiao Li was ambushed near the ancestral hall

787
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:48,012
Xiao Zhao also rushed there quickly

788
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:50,214
Lao Gu also joined the siege

789
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,718
It’s just the martial arts of the ambusher

790
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:55,319
Very strong

791
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:59,524
Hidden weapons also make people skilled

792
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:04,695
The whole plan was almost flawless

793
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:07,064
They even set traps in advance

794
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:09,167
Even if there are a hundred secrets and a few sparse places

795
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,602
It's hard for them to fly even if they have no wings.

796
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:13,571
so smart

797
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,040
amazing

798
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:18,876
What's wrong

799
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:22,113
Any questions

800
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,216
When they were searching Yuan's house

801
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,651
Did you find anything?

802
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,453
Only some furniture and clothing left

803
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,689
All the letters and the like are gone.

804
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:34,192
The clues were also burned away

805
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:35,693
no trace

806
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:40,464
why are you laughing

807
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:43,367
I understand it basically.

808
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:44,669
What did I say

809
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:45,770
What do you understand?

810
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,672
What does the ambusher look like?

811
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,373
Didn't I say it?

812
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:51,409
Wearing a bamboo hat

813
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,011
The knife is carried diagonally on the back

814
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:57,415
The knife is very fast

815
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,285
Swordsman with bamboo hat

816
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:41,626
strangeness

817
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:42,793
Why is it so late at night?

818
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:44,028
Still wearing a hat?

819
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:45,496
Have you seen it before?

820
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:51,135
Go to your house

821
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,266
Princess

822
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,135
Someone wants to see you

823
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:27,805
who

824
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,274
Said to be the companion of the princess

825
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:32,677
One named Wei

826
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:34,078
A person named Xue

827
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:49,827
Sorry, both of you.

828
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:52,296
The princess is still keeping vigil

829
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,831
Can't see guests

830
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,033
Did you say what our name is?

831
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:58,235
Naturally said

832
00:38:58,469 --> 00:38:59,203
Princess

833
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:00,971
I also know who you two are.

834
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:03,207
Then did you say that we

835
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:04,308
It’s about Yuan Zhongxin

836
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:06,477
All said

837
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:09,013
Then why don't you see us?

838
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,841
Why

839
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:39,110
Wake up

840
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,612
A wake is not a closed door to thank guests

841
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:43,214
It stands to reason that we should also

842
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,215
Go in and worship

843
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:46,717
Don't ask me

844
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:47,685
How do I know

845
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:51,789
The chief doesn't care about Yuan Zhongxin anymore

846
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:55,226
Will Yuan Zhongxin be handed over?

847
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,293
It's also true

848
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:58,295
Won't

849
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:00,064
The chief is in mourning

850
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:01,665
This situation is special

851
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:04,769
Then what about

852
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:06,203
We save people ourselves

853
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:09,440
How to save?

854
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:14,345
you say

855
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:16,414
Our Qizhai

856
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,215
It won't break up, right?

857
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,318
Didn’t you just say you still don’t know how to do it?

858
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,554
I'll just say that

859
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:25,456
it's okay no problem

860
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,291
Go back to Wang Kuan to discuss it.

861
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:28,159
Not a big problem

862
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:58,355
blood stains

863
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:01,125
not much

864
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:02,893
It's been some time

865
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:04,128
Small Scene

866
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,096
Which room does your parents have?

867
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:25,850
It's bolted inside

868
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,051
what to do

869
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,326
There seems to be a slight movement

870
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,428
There's someone inside

871
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:42,199
Breaking through the window

872
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:42,933
You answer

873
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:43,567
good

874
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:58,449
Hero, spare your life

875
00:41:58,682 --> 00:41:59,450
How many are

876
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:02,953
A Xuan

877
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,559
Parents

878
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:09,793
what are you doing

879
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:11,896
sister

880
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:16,867
Could this be the prince?

881
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,170
I'm Wang Kuan

882
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:23,240
Finally waited for the prince

883
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,108
Prince Wang

884
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:27,144
You get up first

885
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:30,648
Never kneel

886
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:35,886
can we sit down and talk

887
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:43,994
sorry

888
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:46,964
I'll go back and find someone to fill this window.

889
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:48,866
Don't think about smashing it early.

890
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:49,667
Breathable

891
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:51,669
It's so open

892
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:53,270
Yes Yes

893
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:55,839
father

894
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:58,108
Why is there blood in the yard?

895
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:00,411
The chicken I killed for lunch today

896
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,478
Stewed until now

897
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:02,947
Just waiting for the prince.

898
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:05,549
how do you know

899
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:06,850
Brother Wang is coming

900
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:11,522
My dad told me

901
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,757
What kind of person is Mr. Wang?

902
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:14,391
Find a servant

903
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:15,492
Just a little reminder is enough

904
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:16,727
Why explain it in person?

905
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:18,829
What happened to the money?

906
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:21,732
Xiao Jing

907
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,335
Our family is quite broad.

908
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:25,869
Can help people do some business

909
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:27,404
They just come to the door

910
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:28,906
Don't tell me yet

911
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:30,174
Where is this person who comes to the door?

912
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:31,842
He is a generous person

913
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,711
Is it legal?

914
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,116
How can you collect that money?

915
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:42,086
First time is first time

916
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:43,721
If you don’t believe me, ask your parents

917
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:44,655
Yeah

918
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:45,489
Just the first time

919
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:47,324
But there’s more than one box, right?

920
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:55,633
The one who was wearing a hat just now

921
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:57,434
I'm also here to do business with you.

922
00:43:57,668 --> 00:43:58,669
is not that right

923
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:00,004
What a weirdo

924
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:01,171
Arrived at the house

925
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:02,873
Don't take off the hat.
