1
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:32,986
alright

2
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:37,423
The new armor suits you well

3
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:43,630
My dad said

4
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,633
If the new armor has no blood

5
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,335
Finally less angry

6
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,448
Do you, the Youzhou Army, abide by the Goat God?

7
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,517
How much confidence

8
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:05,952
Na Yuanhao's response to the divine envoy

9
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:06,986
unfavorable rumors

10
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,755
It has been passed down long ago

11
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:11,891
The soldiers were talking a lot

12
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,159
To Yuan Hao

13
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,528
Quite a bit respectful

14
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:17,764
The soldiers are stable

15
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,505
Only the uncles are left.

16
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:30,843
Let's go

17
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,118
It’s a condolence

18
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,654
Why don't we see the Shaodu Commandery Army?

19
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,290
Matters of Life and Death

20
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,492
How can we neglect

21
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,428
Uncles, you have been waiting for a long time.

22
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:30,637
Nonsense

23
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:32,972
you are a close relative

24
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,675
How can you come here wearing armor?

25
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:49,922
This armor

26
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:51,724
My father prepared it for me

27
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,561
The Liang family has no male offspring

28
00:04:58,665 --> 00:04:59,966
He had already thought about it

29
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:01,934
Let me take over the Yuzhou Army

30
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,006
Do the funeral first

31
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:09,075
Military affairs

32
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:10,877
Let’s talk later

33
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:26,826
I'm afraid to talk slowly

34
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,696
The Youzhou Army no longer has the surname Liang.

35
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,160
after i come back

36
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,363
All uncles present

37
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,064
They are all mobilizing their troops and horses.

38
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,400
Never took it again

39
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,634
Commander-in-Chief of the Supervisory Army

40
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:10,436
how

41
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,271
Everyone wants to sit in this seat

42
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:17,710
Shaodu unified the army

43
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,545
you are junior

44
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,647
Not familiar with military affairs

45
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,151
Everyone here

46
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,153
But they are all your elders

47
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,188
You should also buy more

48
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,065
Who is behind you?

49
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,667
Shaodu unified the army

50
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,370
Before this question

51
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,007
You have to think about the consequences

52
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:04,991
I really don't understand

53
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,360
Invite all uncles today

54
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,561
Come to the mourning hall

55
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:13,466
You guys really dare to come

56
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:39,759
This mourning hall is so big

57
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,208
Your soldiers and horses

58
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,109
Can you squeeze in?

59
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:12,465
How can anyone show their filial piety without wearing armor?

60
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,035
Shaodu unified the army

61
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,204
I was wrong

62
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,172
I asked just now

63
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,075
Who is behind you?

64
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:26,879
It seems that no one present answered.

65
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,687
Someone in Xingqing Mansion spread the news

66
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:37,523
If there is a change in the Youzhou Army,

67
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:40,793
We can gather military power in a moment

68
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,133
Shaodu unified the army

69
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,369
I know I was wrong

70
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,037
Yuanhao taught

71
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,910
Yuan Hao is not

72
00:12:58,677 --> 00:12:59,745
Not Yuanhao

73
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,815
It’s Prince Ning Lingge

74
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,284
Have been communicating secretly

75
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,121
Brother Ning Ling

76
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,159
Good plan

77
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:15,327
If no accident

78
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,397
The Liang Family will help Brother Ning Ling get rid of Yuan Hao

79
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,733
Once an accident occurs

80
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,269
The Youzhou Army will also fall into

81
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,503
In Brother Ning Ling’s hands

82
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,007
This father and son are really shady.

83
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,282
More calculations

84
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:47,827
The Youzhou Army still has the surname Liang

85
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,233
See Dutongjun

86
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,226
What do you want to do next?

87
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:22,094
I just said it

88
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,163
I want to be angry for God

89
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,065
fake miracles

90
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:30,603
Don't hide it from uncle

91
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:32,004
I can say this is

92
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,005
Easy to use

93
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,640
Already have three years of experience

94
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,842
You can do it alone

95
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,611
You can't do it alone

96
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,212
So I want to ask my uncle

97
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:41,313
Do you have any

98
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:42,248
trustworthy person

99
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:43,349
No

100
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,484
Go find someone else

101
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,721
But I’m not familiar with this place.

102
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,722
Who am I looking for?

103
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,090
uncle

104
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:53,893
uncle

105
00:14:58,464 --> 00:14:59,765
meet again

106
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,508
Need someone to find me

107
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:13,879
nice to see you again

108
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:16,715
News about the Helan Mountain Incident

109
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:17,650
After spreading

110
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,484
Your father sent me

111
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:19,885
Keep an eye on Wei Zhuoran's side

112
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,321
He said you just need to come to Xingqing Mansion

113
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:23,889
I will definitely find Wei Zhuoran

114
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:25,624
what is this called

115
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:27,226
Magical plan

116
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:30,429
Yuantianguan is also there

117
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,133
Your Majesty doesn't want to see you

118
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,602
He said you are a fool

119
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:39,271
I've warned you so

120
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,073
How dare you come to Xixia to die?

121
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,009
no way

122
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,111
You are now Mr.’s only bloodline

123
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:48,881
Before his efforts come to nothing

124
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,350
I still want to protect your life

125
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:53,352
No matter how hard you try, what will be the result?

126
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,523
The husband bought several concubines

127
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:01,827
Mr.’s original words

128
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,798
As long as I have another son

129
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,566
Love and immortality

130
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:11,704
Does this sound right to you?

131
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,374
I think sir did the right thing

132
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,242
Think about it

133
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,644
gentlemen

134
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,713
A man of great martial arts and a scholar of heaven

135
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,214
Extremely intelligent

136
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,084
How many lives will this last?

137
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,285
Otherwise what a pity

138
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:28,721
It's a pity it's not done yet

139
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:34,760
I think

140
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:36,729
You are quite suitable to be his son

141
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:37,963
Separate Separate

142
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:39,531
How can I match it?

143
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,641
It’s better if you can’t give birth

144
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,491
what are they doing

145
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:06,592
Watching the moon

146
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:09,228
It’s all Mr. Yuan’s past three years.

147
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:10,896
Under Xixia Shou's command

148
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,399
Look at those bald ones

149
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,367
They're all ruthless.

150
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,204
The bald the stronger

151
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:24,476
Mr. Yuan's meaning

152
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:25,611
Just don't show up

153
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:27,413
Something is really going to happen

154
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,348
It's not easy for them to catch you here either.

155
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,884
You have to live safely

156
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,019
Yuan Tianguan said

157
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,287
Protect his bloodline, right?

158
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:36,422
That's what it means

159
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:39,825
What do you need

160
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:40,893
You tell me

161
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,928
Just one word for murder and arson

162
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:43,562
No, no, no

163
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:45,464
No need to kill and set fire

164
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:47,399
Can you commit petty theft?

165
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,300
No problem

166
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:49,468
Can you carve stones?

167
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:50,536
No problem

168
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,639
But there is no difficult task

169
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,407
Will there be any Kongming lanterns?

170
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:58,577
i can teach them

171
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,046
But here in Xixia

172
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,548
Kongming lanterns are not common

173
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:04,917
But you can do

174
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:05,918
How big can it be

175
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:06,652
How big do you want

176
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:24,336
Take a look

177
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,171
Wood carving Wood carving

178
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,539
Take a look

179
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,277
The goat-keeper flew away

180
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:07,646
more than

181
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:10,549
I heard that Xingqing Mansion

182
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,184
Big and small

183
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,019
Dozens of goat-keeping statues

184
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:17,022
disappeared overnight

185
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,323
Where is the thing I asked you to steal?

186
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:20,692
All smashed

187
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:23,762
Buried in Shibuyuan

188
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,665
Then this is

189
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,168
The gods walked away

190
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,204
There are still people in the river

191
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,806
Several stone tablets were uncovered

192
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,042
It is written on the stone tablet

193
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,945
Yuan Hao's blasphemy

194
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,281
Said it was the wrath of the gods

195
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,417
One set after another

196
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:48,720
The stone tablet is carved

197
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,023
It will be unearthed today

198
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:56,328
Now Xingqing Mansion is punishing God

199
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:58,964
Fear is growing

200
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:01,533
You shouldn't stay in the palace

201
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,368
You should go back quickly

202
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:07,005
Now is the time when people's hearts are wandering

203
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,877
This is also a perfect opportunity for you

204
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,012
What was the reaction from the father's side?

205
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,615
daily drinking

206
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:18,817
No action

207
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:25,257
What on earth is he waiting for?

208
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,126
The stone tablets on the river

209
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:29,328
What text was written?

210
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,964
It is the Daxia Wen founded by Qing Tianzi

211
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:33,498
What about the content?

212
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,268
It's all street talk

213
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,237
I dare not repeat it

214
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,639
Since the founding of Daxia Wen

215
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:41,740
Less than ten years

216
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,641
How old is that stone tablet?

217
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,643
Said to be an ancient stone tablet

218
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:46,245
yes

219
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,614
Where did the Daxia literature come from in ancient times?

220
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,482
Your Majesty, this is a flaw

221
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:51,516
This can be used

222
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:52,784
Refute the theory of gods

223
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,486
Can't refute

224
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:56,722
This is obviously unreasonable

225
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,156
Why can't I refute it?

226
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:00,425
I feel it too

227
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,760
Should not use Tangut

228
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:03,762
It doesn't make sense.

229
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:05,931
There is no need to speak common sense in front of gods

230
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,400
Why did Xixia script exist in ancient times?

231
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,569
Because of the gaze of the Goat God

232
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:11,536
Beyond the Past and Present

233
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,005
It is enough to illustrate the divine power

234
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,306
no trace to follow

235
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,975
Even gods can’t curse.

236
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:17,576
How about you stipulate

237
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:18,443
What should the gods say?

238
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,279
I dare not

239
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,416
Rebuke mortals with the tone of God

240
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,285
Do mortals have any reason to say?

241
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,386
That opponent

242
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,121
You have to be invincible

243
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:33,158
Miracles are all man-made

244
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:36,628
The key is people

245
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:37,696
But

246
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,931
Can't find who fabricated it

247
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:41,400
And these miracles

248
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,934
appear more frequently

249
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:45,237
People’s hearts are getting more and more frightened.

250
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:46,638
so many miracles

251
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,041
One or two people can't create it

252
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:50,042
right

253
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,443
Inside Xingqing Mansion

254
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:52,778
Someone must be secretly supporting

255
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,280
Yuan Zhongxin

256
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:56,882
tell me the truth

257
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:58,216
Over there at Sibu Garden

258
00:21:58,216 --> 00:21:59,318
Is there someone like you too?

259
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:00,919
It’s my first time to come to Xingqingfu

260
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:02,120
How come there are acquaintances?

261
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:03,622
That's wrong

262
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:06,058
Shibuyuan has also been secretly and openly

263
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:08,060
Rumors driving the wrath of the gods

264
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:09,561
It's normal

265
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:10,929
no no

266
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,064
Look

267
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,266
It was previously preached that the goat-keeper god

268
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:16,301
Shibuyuan has been obstructing it

269
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,203
Why is it reversed now?

270
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,638
Helping spread the miracles

271
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,641
Once upon a time there was a sheep guardian angel

272
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:23,508
This benefit is not available

273
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,509
On top of Shibu Garden

274
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,346
benefit

275
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,415
There is a god now

276
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:31,583
No miracles

277
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,251
You can all take it on your own head

278
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:34,486
The status of Nashibo Garden

279
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:35,821
Naturally, a rising tide lifts all boats

280
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:37,589
There are many benefits

281
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:43,161
It’s the gods who say this.

282
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,530
In the end, it all became a benefit

283
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,399
Where is the god?

284
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:48,700
It's all human heart

285
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,171
There is no match for this

286
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:55,307
How to deal with it?

287
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,679
I keep him till now

288
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:03,048
Just for this moment

289
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:06,084
he

290
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:10,655
How long has it been since I left the palace?

291
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:11,957
No more banquets

292
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:17,229
Banquet outside the palace

293
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:18,563
Yuan Hao's order

294
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,199
Important ministers transferred from Xingqing Mansion

295
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,467
Shared Feast

296
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:24,336
this feast

297
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,438
It's the best time to poison

298
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:28,974
Is the medicine ready?

299
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,410
Poisonous and fatal upon entry

300
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,077
good

301
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:33,812
Very poisonous

302
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:37,215
Yuan Hao has extremely high martial arts skills

303
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:39,384
Extremely poisonous so there won’t be any accidents

304
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,822
Where is your brother named Wang?

305
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,516
What is there to see in the Imperial Palace?

306
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,585
You are not afraid of being discovered

307
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,687
Never been fresh

308
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:16,788
rest assured

309
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,323
I won’t run away if I’m here.

310
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:21,259
Then prepare first

311
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,328
The banquet has only been held for a few days.

312
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,096
I'm looking for a chance

313
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:25,864
Take you first

314
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:27,165
Walk around the hall

315
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,733
To avoid accidents

316
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:30,802
Why do I feel

317
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,337
The prime minister’s intention to kill Yuan Hao

318
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:33,738
More eager than us

319
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,576
It’s urgent to be kind to others

320
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:38,677
move

321
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:41,079
Then let's do this first

322
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,048
You guys are waiting for my news

323
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:43,982
Prime Minister

324
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,085
Yuan Hao came from Xingqing Mansion

325
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:48,186
Who are you calling?

326
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:50,021
Sixteenth Division Chief

327
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:51,923
Most of them have high authority

328
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:53,124
correct

329
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:54,860
There is also a Song Dynasty person

330
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:56,895
you know

331
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:05,370
Yuan Hao summons you to leave the palace

332
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:08,373
Rumors of divine punishment circulate endlessly

333
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:10,775
Yuan Hao always has to find a way to deal with it

334
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,216
Uncle, when you surrendered to Xixia

335
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:20,652
What position did Yuanhao give you?

336
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:22,721
He served as the director of the Mokansi

337
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:24,189
Mokansi

338
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:25,690
The Song Dynasty also had a Mokansi

339
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:27,459
Same here

340
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,495
In charge of the transfer of examinations for officials in various places

341
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,197
Account verification duties

342
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:33,732
Very important

343
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,467
Just a job

344
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,935
I am from Song Dynasty

345
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:38,236
Where can I find out?

346
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:40,171
Performance examination course for Daxia officials

347
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:42,707
Just getting paid and doing nothing

348
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:44,643
Yuan Hao often looks for me

349
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:46,411
Asked about the Forbidden Army of the Song Dynasty

350
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:47,345
Various matters

351
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:48,980
Another thing is

352
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,182
Famous generals of the Song Dynasty

353
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:52,984
What are their personalities and hobbies?

354
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,687
Sure enough, he was trying to find out the truth about the Song Dynasty.

355
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:57,689
That's what I mean

356
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:00,525
But this is wrong

357
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:02,160
uncle your position

358
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:03,929
It has nothing to do with the rumors of divine punishment

359
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:05,697
Why did Yuan Hao

360
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:06,798
Are you summoned to leave the palace?

361
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,200
Who knows?

362
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:12,370
I'll go with you

363
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:13,438
can not go

364
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:16,441
Too dangerous

365
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:18,476
You are Mr. Yuan’s only bloodline

366
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:19,778
Can't take risks

367
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:22,080
Yanei and Zhao Jian

368
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,682
They all lost their traces in Helan Mountain

369
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:24,683
Maybe in the palace

370
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:25,450
There is an answer

371
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:26,885
Their last name is not Yuan

372
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:28,219
It has nothing to do with me whether I die or not.

373
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:30,121
You don't have to go

374
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:30,689
Yuan Zhongxin

375
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,626
Zhao Jian and the others are absolutely safe

376
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,133
how do you know

377
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,180
Pei Jing is not

378
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,147
Are you with them?

379
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:58,883
what do you want to say in the end

380
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:01,286
I told you, don’t believe it

381
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,420
Pei Jing

382
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:04,456
It's possessed by the dragon god

383
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:07,926
You still don’t believe it

384
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:10,729
The Dragon God also said he would grant me eternal life.

385
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,601
You saw me with your own eyes

386
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:18,236
Performed so many miracles

387
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:20,138
Saw what happened?

388
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:20,905
fine

389
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:24,009
I mean

390
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:24,776
If Xiao Jing is really

391
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:25,777
If the dragon god is possessed

392
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:26,678
You should go more

393
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:27,779
Why?

394
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,547
You seem pious

395
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:31,650
Maybe I'll grant you eternal life?

396
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,119
That makes sense.

397
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:43,461
How long has he been like this?

398
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:00,478
Yuan Hao held a banquet in the palace

399
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:02,380
We also invited various supervisory and military departments to

400
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:03,682
Will anyone go?

401
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:05,183
no one will go

402
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:08,453
theory of divine punishment

403
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:10,288
It has spread to all the military supervisory departments

404
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,224
These soldiers killed a lot of people

405
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,726
More and more afraid of ghosts and gods

406
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:17,228
not to mention

407
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:19,731
Everyone is talking about my father's death

408
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,800
It was also Yuan Hao who seized military power.

409
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,600
One step conspiracy

410
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,503
Now the commander in chief

411
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:27,572
I am somewhat suspicious of Yuan Hao

412
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,040
Chilling

413
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,942
See the truth about Yuan Hao

414
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:36,247
Youzhou Army has no second thoughts

415
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:37,582
Next

416
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:38,516
Just looking for opportunities

417
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:39,617
In various military supervision departments

418
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:40,852
Just look for allies

419
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:44,255
You want to leave

420
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:45,223
Banquet outside the palace

421
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:46,524
I have to see

422
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:47,659
Danger

423
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:49,561
My companion

424
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:51,529
Missing

425
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:56,868
Then I

426
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:57,769
You can't go with

427
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,039
Youzhou Army cannot do without you

428
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:04,142
still coming back

429
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:05,610
if alive

430
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:08,446
I'll come to you again to compete with swords

431
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:11,382
I can't beat you

432
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:12,484
I give you a hand

433
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:13,918
left hand right hand

434
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,053
The right hand cannot be given

435
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:17,522
Then I still can’t win

436
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:33,938
Youzhou pigeon

437
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,041
Mountains and water

438
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:38,810
two inseparable

439
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:42,480
If there is news

440
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:44,582
You can leave it to it to bring the letter back

441
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:52,090
good

442
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:55,126
Then you and your companions should remember

443
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,528
In Daxia

444
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:58,596
You will never be at the end of your rope

445
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,198
Because of the Youzhou Army

446
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,700
It will always be your retreat

447
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:22,720
I've thought about it

448
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:24,989
I give you your right hand

449
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:00,825
Yuan Zhongxin

450
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,026
You said the Dragon God is in Xixia

451
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:02,760
Will you get used to it?

452
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:04,529
Will it be acclimatized?

453
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:07,966
Will the gods adapt to the climate?

454
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:09,334
I think this problem

455
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,369
You'd better go and ask yourself

456
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:12,837
I'm still a little nervous

457
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:14,539
It's okay, don't be nervous

458
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:15,740
gentlemen

459
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:25,617
I have to tell Mr. Yuan about this.

460
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:28,386
My hands and feet are all healed

461
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:31,222
If you want to stop me next time

462
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:32,357
It is better to go directly

463
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:33,725
It's easier to cut it off

464
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:36,361
Do you think I dare not?

465
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:37,962
If you dare, come, come, come

466
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:39,297
gentlemen

467
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:40,498
Everyone is in Xixia

468
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:41,766
It's not necessary. I can't do it.

469
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,067
do not talk

470
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,404
Can't stop people from dying

471
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,607
I heard you were in Xingqing Mansion

472
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:50,408
Found a concubine

473
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:52,477
Then I really wish you

474
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:54,212
It is a blessing to have children early and have many children.

475
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:03,721
I asked people to inquire

476
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,057
The whereabouts of Zhao Jian and others were not found.

477
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,228
You have been in Xingqing Mansion for so many days

478
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,063
Never mentioned this either

479
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,399
Not worried about their safety

480
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,801
I believe they are safe and sound

481
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:18,102
why to believe

482
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:20,305
If I don't believe it

483
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:21,606
I can't hold on at all

484
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,608
idiot

485
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,945
Only yourself is the most important in this world

486
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:29,047
understand this

487
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:30,548
to live longer

488
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:32,483
Not affected by foreign objects

489
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:34,719
You don't know

490
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:35,787
what do i want to do

491
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:37,388
Just make sure you live

492
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,457
Do you know what the meaning is?

493
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:44,929
I really thought

494
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:47,198
You will cripple me again this time

495
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,268
You won't go if you're disabled

496
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:51,502
You have to climb

497
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:52,937
So say it

498
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,106
Can't stop people from dying

499
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:56,841
Since you know I'm going to die

500
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:58,676
Then why are you following me?

501
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:02,447
Follow along and take a look

502
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:05,249
If I could save you

503
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,684
if not

504
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:08,519
Collect the body for you

505
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:11,789
Mr. Dragon God is also here

506
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,561
what

507
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:19,063
The Dragon God may be in the palace

508
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:20,865
When the time comes, I will help you make a wish together

509
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:22,000
Guarantee you more births

510
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,067
A few fat boys

511
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:24,135
Don't worry

512
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,506
What is this all about?

513
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,942
Yu Chiyuan is a dragon and a phoenix among men.

514
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:32,944
Can you take him under your wing?

515
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,746
It’s true that the ancestors of the Yuan family have accumulated virtues.

516
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:37,582
Too much praise

517
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:38,616
Too much praise

518
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:40,685
gentlemen

519
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:44,055
gentlemen

520
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:47,058
gentlemen

521
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:49,060
gentlemen

522
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:08,679
Officials from various departments are on their way

523
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,481
The place for banquet is right here

524
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:11,349
Look

525
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:14,519
That’s where Yuan Hao’s main seat is

526
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,255
Isn't it poisoning?

527
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:18,423
Let’s take a look at the banquet seats

528
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:19,290
Any functions

529
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:22,060
Although there are many people and chaos

530
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,961
You can't do it in the kitchen, either.

531
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:26,197
I still have to be wary of this.

532
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:27,765
Don't poison the kitchen

533
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:28,933
Then how to play

534
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,735
Arrive before the banquet

535
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,203
Poisoning in front of Yuan Hao

536
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:33,504
Of course not.

537
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:34,772
The kitchen is not good

538
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:36,240
Even banquets are not allowed

539
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:37,508
Then only

540
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,343
On the way to the palace

541
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:40,344
Make an article

542
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:44,782
Your little brother named Wang

543
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:45,450
Why not?

544
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:47,585
Today we're talking about something important.

545
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:48,686
coming

546
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:50,221
what's coming

547
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:53,057
Where can I pick him up?

548
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,372
This side corridor is locked

549
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:09,540
how did you get in

550
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:12,677
Don't make fun of me

551
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:13,644
There is a cliff outside

552
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:14,612
how did you get in

553
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,047
What should I do if someone finds out?

554
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:17,348
Not joking

555
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:20,785
Didn’t the Prime Minister say that just now?

556
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:22,453
The journey of bringing dishes to the palace

557
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,621
There is a chance to poison

558
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:24,989
yes

559
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:26,290
By the time

560
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:28,292
Miss Pei can pretend to be a maid

561
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:31,529
Poisoning outside the palace gate

562
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:32,330
No

563
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:33,931
Yuanhao's Meals

564
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:35,967
Escorted here alone from the apse

565
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:37,368
Poisoned by the queen

566
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:38,536
No, no, no

567
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:40,505
Heavily guarded all the way

568
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:41,806
There are armored guards again

569
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:44,775
That means there's nothing we can do

570
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:45,776
No, no, no

571
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,278
Sneak into the apse

572
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:49,347
Except for the maid dress

573
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:51,449
I need to find another noble person

574
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:54,285
The Prime Minister is that noble man

575
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:55,186
No, no, no

576
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:58,723
It's not convenient for me to interfere in the affairs of the apse.

577
00:35:58,923 --> 00:35:59,724
Who is that

578
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:00,625
Not urgent

579
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:04,328
Let's find another trouble first

580
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:07,565
Ruo Yuanhao

581
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,500
See through poison

582
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:10,801
What should I do?

583
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:12,336
Does the Prime Minister think so?

584
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:15,506
Hidden on the beam

585
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:24,582
Blade Assassination

586
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:27,385
Although Yuan Hao is brave

587
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,419
After all, we are human

588
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,588
Assassination from the sky

589
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:32,223
He can't react

590
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:32,757
good

591
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:34,525
Just do it

592
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:36,727
Wang Kuanliang and I ambush

593
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:37,695
Xiao Jing poisoned

594
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:39,764
If this is true

595
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,766
The person who assassinates him will definitely die.

596
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,736
I'm so kind

597
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:46,938
How can I just watch

598
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:48,339
Look at you teenagers

599
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:49,740
Are you looking for death?

600
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:51,576
so

601
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:53,778
I'll give it to you again

602
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:55,246
Found a way out

603
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,450
Falling from the sky

604
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:00,685
Assassination of Yuan Hao

605
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:01,719
There is a way out

606
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:03,120
If Yuan Hao dies

607
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,489
Who is the Lord of Daxia

608
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:08,459
Prince Ning Lingge

609
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:11,696
Brother Ning Ling is a noble man

610
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:15,299
It is also a way to survive

611
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,369
Wu Zang asked to see the prince

612
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,941
This Prime Minister and I

613
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,843
It's just a nod of acquaintance

614
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:28,946
His sister

615
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:30,781
Won the favor of Qingtianzi

616
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:33,784
He's not here to show off

617
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,254
You're still here to humiliate me.

618
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:38,489
It's hard to say

619
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,093
let him in

620
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:04,982
Let's all go down

621
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:08,419
Prime Minister

622
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:11,122
Why are you free to come here today?

623
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:15,926
There is no secret that Pang has met the queen

624
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,361
Met the prince

625
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:19,730
The status of the Prime Minister is so noble

626
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:22,366
Why do you do this great gift?

627
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:25,569
Hurry up and help the Prime Minister up.

628
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,809
Please get up quickly, Prime Minister

629
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:34,378
Beg the prince to spare his life

630
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,347
beg queen for mercy

631
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:39,850
Prime Minister

632
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:42,687
Where did you start talking about this?

633
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:47,625
I have a word to say, and I will die if I say it

634
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:49,327
But I have to say

635
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:51,028
Prince

636
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:53,731
The Qingtianzi resorted to military violence

637
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:54,732
Several years of war

638
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:56,200
Within Daxia

639
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,535
People have long been living in poverty

640
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:58,602
All industries are in decline

641
00:38:59,036 --> 00:38:59,837
My Big Summer

642
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:02,239
It's been a long time since I've been suffering from Qing Tianzi

643
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:10,548
I sincerely request the prince

644
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:12,850
For the sake of millions of people in Daxia

645
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:14,218
as soon as possible

646
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:16,821
Instead

647
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:18,089
absurd

648
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:21,559
I am so happy today

649
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,961
All thanks to my father’s unparalleled achievements

650
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:25,763
Now the war is decided

651
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:26,964
Peace on earth

652
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:28,332
How can we talk about resorting to militarism?

653
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:29,667
Prince

654
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:31,302
Today's Taiping

655
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:33,804
It's just Qing Tianzi's plan to delay the war

656
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:35,172
After the peace treaty was signed

657
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:37,375
All supervisory departments are working hard to prepare their troops

658
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,342
Recuperate and recuperate

659
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:40,544
Your Highness, you don't know

660
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:42,580
Within five years

661
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:45,049
As long as the national power has eased

662
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,318
The Blue Emperor will certainly send out troops again

663
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:48,886
Causing chaos in the world

664
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:52,857
Citizens of Daxia

665
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:55,826
Unable to fight for years

666
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:05,970
But he is my father.

667
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:07,772
Citizens of Daxia

668
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:09,840
personal relationship

669
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:12,243
Which one is more important?

670
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,546
Of course, livelihood is the most important thing

671
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:17,648
Since the livelihood of the people is the most important thing

672
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:21,252
How can it be done for one's own sake?

673
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:23,087
Personal Affection

674
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:25,523
Is this the right word to use?

675
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:27,625
Just bear with it

676
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:32,496
Prime Minister

677
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:34,532
You get up first

678
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,108
What does the Prime Minister want to do?

679
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:45,609
Your Highness

680
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:49,046
you can get to know them

681
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,260
never seen

682
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:06,497
Several of them are from the Song Dynasty

683
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:08,499
they come here

684
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:10,801
Just to assassinate Qing Tianzi

685
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:12,570
Bold

686
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:15,739
Your Highness, the livelihood of the people is the most important thing.

687
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,542
I absolutely won't

688
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:20,211
He attacked my father

689
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:23,047
This is my bottom line

690
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:25,850
No need to use your hands

691
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,818
I'm here to plead

692
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:28,819
plead

693
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:31,622
These young people from the Song Dynasty

694
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:33,557
Have a loyal and brave heart

695
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:35,893
If something unexpected happened to Emperor Qing

696
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,762
It must be His Highness who is in control of the situation.

697
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:39,597
When

698
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:41,165
I also hope that Your Highness

699
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,967
Give them a way to live

700
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:44,668
besides

701
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:47,771
what else do you want

702
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,440
One more thing

703
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,242
If you want to poison

704
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:53,878
Someone must be sent to sneak into the apse

705
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,079
This matter

706
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:57,581
We still need help from Your Highness and the Queen.

707
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,985
Isn’t your sister the princess?

708
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:03,387
she takes care of children

709
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,789
And he doesn’t care about the chores in the back hall all year round

710
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:07,525
If you suddenly arrange someone

711
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:09,226
too abrupt

712
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:19,503
Queen Mother

713
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:21,639
Queen Mother

714
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:26,677
The Prime Minister is still there

715
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,614
Not feeling well lately

716
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,616
Fell asleep instantly

717
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:34,919
what are you talking about

718
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:36,687
Empress Hui

719
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:37,888
Your Majesty and the Prince

720
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,156
Talk about national affairs

721
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:39,857
As the saying goes

722
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:41,158
National affairs

723
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:42,459
I won't listen anymore

724
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:43,894
I don't understand either

725
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:45,229
correct

726
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,897
Your sister recently

727
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,533
A prince was born to Qing Tianzi

728
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:52,503
Born very strong

729
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:53,637
Here I am

730
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:55,573
Prepared some goldware for children

731
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,242
I'll send someone to deliver it to you later.

732
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,344
It's also a celebration

733
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:01,579
Queen Xie

734
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:03,080
Prime Minister

735
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,249
To make the brothers and sisters have today

736
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,650
It all depends on my father

737
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:09,219
assassination now

738
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,655
Wouldn’t it be self-destructive?

739
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,726
There has to be an explanation for this.

740
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:19,763
Kind

741
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:22,700
How about this answer

742
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:23,867
What do you say?

743
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,438
Let's tell the truth then

744
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:29,173
Your Highness

745
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,908
In fact, the reason is very simple

746
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:32,743
We brother and sister

747
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,211
Heavy feelings

748
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:36,080
Heavy feelings

749
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,616
Kill brother-in-law

750
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:42,853
The prince should know

751
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:45,122
My sister's previous husband

752
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,091
Yeli, the King of Tiandu, meets a beggar

753
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:48,959
He died at the hands of Yuan Hao

754
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:51,095
Husband-killing hatred

755
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:53,063
How can I forget

756
00:43:57,067 --> 00:43:59,136
She's out for revenge
