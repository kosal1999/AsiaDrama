1
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,184
We are lacking sacrifices.

2
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:32,919
Just a few of you are here

3
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,791
Brother Ning Ling is here too

4
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:41,594
The two of us are really

5
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,129
A loving father and a filial son

6
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:44,998
good

7
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:48,368
Give you a ride

8
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,836
No hidden lies

9
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:42,849
Xiao Xue

10
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,265
Such a big divorced palace

11
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,167
Hide some troops

12
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,069
It's not a difficult thing, right?

13
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,305
in this world

14
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,840
I only believe in myself

15
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:10,710
Retreat first

16
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:24,924
Leave it to you

17
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:04,731
your time is running out

18
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,432
If something cannot be done

19
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,135
Don't blame me for turning around and leaving

20
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,120
Sheep Guardian

21
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,315
Stop looking at it

22
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,117
The world's fundamental

23
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:26,552
There is no god

24
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:27,687
all fake

25
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,390
Killer of thieves

26
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:33,492
Bounty knighthood

27
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:23,442
Tomorrow's Road

28
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,244
Maybe it's the end

29
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,349
Just come with me

30
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,051
Forget about life

31
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,321
Seven fasts in one

32
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,956
life and death together

33
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:38,524
kill

34
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,314
you can't kill me

35
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,617
I just want everyone in the world

36
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,651
all know

37
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:07,186
Even God

38
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,255
You have to kneel at my feet too

39
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,423
Bow down to me

40
00:13:54,066 --> 00:14:04,310
Divine Punishment Divine Punishment

41
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:29,568
Divine Punishment Divine Punishment

42
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,134
good chance

43
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:40,933
Success

44
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:53,245
Where is the flower tree?

45
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:32,197
You deserve to sit here too

46
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,038
Prime Minister

47
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:22,314
Prime Minister

48
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:26,685
kill him

49
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,988
Kill him and it'll be over

50
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:37,029
Prime Minister

51
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:39,965
Prime Minister

52
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,434
Wonho is currently seriously injured

53
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,002
Kill him now

54
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:44,836
best time

55
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,405
Do it

56
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,096
Prince Conspiracy

57
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:46,832
I should work hard to kill him

58
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,634
Qingtianzi, please rest assured

59
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:02,614
I said something wrong

60
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,284
It must be that the gods are disgusted

61
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:08,720
He encountered the assassination of his own son again

62
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,789
It can be said that the sky is angry and the people are resentful.

63
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:12,557
from now on

64
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,494
There is no more Qingtianzi

65
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:22,834
No hidden lies

66
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:03,675
Eliminate evil

67
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,477
Catch up with Brother Ning Ling

68
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:07,712
revenge for the king

69
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:08,980
yes

70
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:18,256
Queen Mother

71
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,057
Queen Mother

72
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:22,661
Queen Mother

73
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:24,396
Queen Mother

74
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:26,631
Queen Mother

75
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,400
I killed him

76
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,534
you sure

77
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:31,136
you already

78
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:32,337
Kill him

79
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:33,972
So seriously injured

80
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:34,973
No way to survive

81
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:36,241
Then you are at this moment

82
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:37,409
He should be taking over the throne

83
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:38,777
why would you

84
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:39,644
run back to me

85
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:41,480
There is no hidden secret and Pang wants to kill me

86
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:43,248
Hurry back to Xingqing Mansion

87
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:44,783
Gather the old troops to reverse the situation and break the situation

88
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,284
Mother, go!

89
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:49,554
That's too late

90
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:09,875
No hidden lies

91
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,546
Do you dare to kill the prince?

92
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:17,048
The prince's crime of regicide is heinous

93
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:18,416
Only death

94
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:24,422
Prime Minister

95
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:26,391
Prime Minister

96
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:28,994
I am willing to give up my position as prince

97
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:31,530
When Yuan Hao dies, there will be disputes

98
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:34,499
I have some prestige in the military

99
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:37,469
I am willing to help the Prime Minister take charge of power

100
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,005
to find a way to survive

101
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,173
How about just talking?

102
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:54,252
standing

103
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,392
Queen Mother

104
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:02,661
Did not you say

105
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,596
Is living the most important thing?

106
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:05,697
You feel

107
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,167
Does he give you a way to survive now?

108
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:21,546
He is giving it to you now

109
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:23,014
Humiliation before death

110
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:25,350
Brother Ning Ling

111
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,653
If we have a way to survive

112
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,823
to kowtow

113
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:34,492
That's no problem

114
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:38,396
But if we

115
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:39,831
There is only one way to die

116
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,767
So dignified

117
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,503
Stay in the moment

118
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:48,707
ok

119
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:54,980
The queen mother is right

120
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:13,031
She is worthy of being the Queen of Daxia.

121
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,335
It's not anymore.

122
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:42,661
Farewell, Prince

123
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,044
Queen, rest assured

124
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,012
It is only the prince who is plotting rebellion

125
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,116
I will not be rude to the Queen

126
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,185
It’s just that this world is chaotic

127
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:16,154
Too dangerous

128
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,957
Thinking about the queen's safety

129
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,525
from now on

130
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:23,261
Just don't leave this house

131
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:28,500
Thank you to the Prime Minister for your love

132
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,436
But don't worry

133
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,273
I will definitely live well

134
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:38,543
Because I still want to watch

135
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:41,412
What about the ending without a collector?

136
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:23,615
Queen

137
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:26,751
You go back and rest first.

138
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:28,586
Qingtianzi's side

139
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,687
I'll take care of it

140
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:43,334
Didn't expect that

141
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:44,936
No medicine, no treatment

142
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:46,571
That's it, Your Majesty

143
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,972
I can still persist to this day

144
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:50,942
How long

145
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:53,811
It's been more than ten days, right?

146
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:57,215
Are you worried about the state affairs of Daxia?

147
00:31:57,949 --> 00:31:59,384
There is a minister here

148
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:02,453
Qing Tianzi can rest assured

149
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,422
after you die

150
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:07,392
My son is the prince

151
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,393
absurd

152
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:10,128
What prince?

153
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:12,397
The new Lord of Daxia

154
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:14,432
Qing Tianzi

155
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:15,833
You can relax

156
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:17,635
Brother Ning Ling is dead

157
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,170
From now on

158
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,806
No one will fight with my son anymore

159
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,112
Qing Tianzi

160
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,183
Go with peace of mind

161
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:21,466
Farewell to the passing of the Qing Emperor

162
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:02,407
You should at least pay your respects.

163
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,844
Brother Ning Ling will die these days

164
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,179
No twists and turns, right?

165
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:09,380
Brother Ning Ling

166
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,715
Assassination of Qingtianzi

167
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:12,817
Saw by a group of guards

168
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,085
I kill him

169
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:15,253
as a matter of course

170
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:26,230
from now on

171
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:27,231
Summer

172
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,233
It’s just that I don’t have a hidden clan

173
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,268
The world

174
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:36,207
correct

175
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:38,142
Where are those young men?

176
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:43,848
Yuan Hao and Brother Ning Ling are dead

177
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,018
did not expect

178
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:48,886
Such a difficult thing

179
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:51,355
It was actually done by you guys

180
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:56,727
The Prime Minister does not have to be humble

181
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:58,529
without you

182
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:00,164
Nor are we today

183
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:02,500
without you

184
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:03,968
I won't make up my mind either

185
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,069
go on this road

186
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:07,672
history will remember

187
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:09,907
Death of the Tyrant Yuan Hao

188
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:11,876
Died by Ning Lingge

189
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:13,744
Died because I didn't hide the truth

190
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,113
Maybe

191
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,849
There will also be your names

192
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:28,426
there won't be us

193
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,461
Because we don't exist at all

194
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:32,063
Congratulations to the Prime Minister

195
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:33,698
take charge

196
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:36,868
Now I know the truth

197
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:39,971
we are the only ones left

198
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:40,738
yes

199
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:43,374
Only

200
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,510
You guys

201
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:42,953
Go further

202
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:44,455
It is within the Song Dynasty

203
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,090
I won't send it.

204
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:48,859
The Prime Minister will not kill us

205
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,529
The day of the assassination

206
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:53,030
Japanese Red Cross Society

207
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:55,566
how did you do it

208
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,368
calculated

209
00:38:57,735 --> 00:38:58,903
Just happened to meet him

210
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:00,905
Which country believes in

211
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,374
How can this be counted?

212
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:04,809
It seems

213
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,978
It is God's will that Yuan Hao should die.

214
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:10,381
If it weren't for this celestial phenomenon

215
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,350
Even if you kill Yuan Hao that day

216
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,217
He will also be

217
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:14,585
The soldiers under his command beheaded

218
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:17,088
We all know this

219
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:18,556
so

220
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:20,524
Except for this celestial phenomenon

221
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,426
Where is the way you arranged to survive?

222
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:25,029
No

223
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,533
Just kidding

224
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:31,936
How could someone go to the road of death?

225
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,171
I just want to say something

226
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:36,107
Just because this celestial phenomenon is abnormal

227
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,576
The Prime Minister will let us leave alive.

228
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:40,811
I'm not that lunatic Yuan Hao

229
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:42,980
Daxia is just a small country

230
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:44,048
Unable to fight

231
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:45,216
from now on

232
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:46,984
We still have to rely on Da Song to live

233
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:48,185
If I kill you

234
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:49,754
Wouldn’t that mean being an enemy of the Song Dynasty?

235
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,055
Not worth it

236
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:53,257
kill us

237
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:54,425
It means being an enemy of the Song Dynasty

238
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:56,060
You go through life and death

239
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:57,595
Assassination of Yuan Hao

240
00:39:58,295 --> 00:39:59,029
On

241
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,332
There must be an order from the Privy Council of the Song Dynasty

242
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:02,099
Not good

243
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:04,068
It was arranged personally by the Emperor of the Song Dynasty

244
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:05,369
this kind of thing

245
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:06,771
Can't hide it from me

246
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,506
Have you ever thought about it?

247
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:10,474
We want to kill Yuan Hao ourselves

248
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:11,976
It has nothing to do with the court

249
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:14,044
Absolutely impossible

250
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,780
If it weren't for the secret order from the court

251
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:17,348
Threats from family members

252
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:18,182
How could there be someone

253
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:19,817
risking death

254
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:21,085
Doing such a big thing

255
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:22,987
If it is to eliminate war

256
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:24,655
To protect the peace of the world

257
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:25,556
Just for this

258
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,057
I don't want my life anymore

259
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:29,493
Who would believe it?

260
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:33,864
yes

261
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:36,333
Who would believe it?

262
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:39,770
Only a fool would believe it.

263
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,144
You young people are promising

264
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:48,179
Go back this time

265
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:49,547
He must be a high-ranking official with a generous salary

266
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,515
Congratulations in advance from my side

267
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:52,450
look forward to

268
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,552
Goodbye

269
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:01,986
It's really stupid to think about it

270
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:03,487
Come along this way

271
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:04,755
No benefit gained

272
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:06,257
This has to be postponed until now

273
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,625
I won't wade into this muddy water

274
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:45,095
You and Webster

275
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:46,497
Have you known each other for a long time?

276
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:49,333
So you kill him

277
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:51,769
Is it to help him escape?

278
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:53,604
My new concubine

279
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:55,806
Already pregnant

280
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,308
Yuan Zhongxin

281
00:42:58,709 --> 00:42:59,944
from now on

282
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:02,646
You and I have nothing to do with each other anymore

283
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:04,848
answer me

284
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:14,858
He doesn't answer

285
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:18,329
Wait until I'm healed

286
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:20,064
I still want to kill him

287
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:21,065
To avenge my father

288
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:23,968
I'll help you then

289
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:28,339
That

290
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:29,773
After we return to the Song Dynasty

291
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:30,674
what to do

292
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:32,776
Of course, I need to recuperate first.

293
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,180
What about after the injury heals?

294
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:37,448
Can't live forever

295
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,449
There is no goal anymore

296
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:40,250
There are ten rooms in the secret pavilion

297
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:41,785
There are several other fasts

298
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:42,853
Missing

299
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:43,854
maybe we should

300
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:44,855
get them back

301
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:45,889
Makes sense

302
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:48,092
When I was in the Secret Pavilion before

303
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:49,059
Other fasts

304
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:50,628
Several people owe me gambling debts.

305
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:52,196
You have to get this money back, right?

306
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,544
Why don't you go see Liang Mixiang?

307
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:08,812
Let's talk privately

308
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:10,447
No

309
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,716
She is the Commander-in-Chief of the Young Capital of Youzhou

310
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:14,785
I am a child of a military household in the Song Dynasty

311
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:17,554
I just hope we won’t see each other on the battlefield in the future

312
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:19,556
I'm satisfied

313
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:21,392
Then it's settled

314
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:23,327
After recovering from the injury

315
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,695
Let's search together

316
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:25,996
The whereabouts of the rest of the group

317
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:27,665
Not good

318
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:28,766
They still have a mission

319
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:31,535
It's quite interesting when I think about it.

320
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:33,303
Chief

321
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:34,471
What do you think

322
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,107
Let’s get married first

323
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:38,709
What first?

324
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:44,348
After we recover from our injuries

325
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,382
Yuan Zhongxin and I

326
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:46,583
Xiao Jing and Wang Kuan

327
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:47,951
Give me your kiss first

328
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:49,286
Then think about other things

329
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:52,489
Chief

330
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,924
Are you so direct?

331
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:56,794
For me

332
00:44:56,794 --> 00:44:58,128
That's the top priority
