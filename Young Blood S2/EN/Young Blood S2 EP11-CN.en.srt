1
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,341
servants employed by the academy

2
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,409
Enthusiastic

3
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,811
The academy is dealing with some debris

4
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:53,279
If you have any needs

5
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,414
You can also ask them for help

6
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:55,882
Very thoughtful

7
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:59,185
He looks kind and kind-hearted.

8
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,655
The academy thinks a lot about its students.

9
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,290
You are also a student

10
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:05,091
yes

11
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,093
The post of director is all filled by students

12
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:09,896
He is the same generation as Nizi.

13
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,066
Those are all classmates

14
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:13,766
That

15
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,268
what do we call

16
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:19,372
Webster

17
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:21,307
And me

18
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:23,710
aunt

19
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:27,614
you are too polite

20
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,182
In fact, just call me Shibo

21
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:30,350
My surname is not Wei

22
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,318
But brother Wei

23
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,588
It's a masterpiece at first glance

24
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,090
so much

25
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:39,359
Are you biological?

26
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,663
Less than asking you something

27
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,165
Sir, please speak

28
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:47,600
Within our academy

29
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,335
In addition to normal regulations

30
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:51,971
Are there any special taboos?

31
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,309
That's it.

32
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:00,280
some rumors

33
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,181
but

34
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,882
Scholars should not talk about these things

35
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:04,984
I'm not a scholar

36
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,386
You can tell me

37
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,389
Actually it's nothing

38
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,057
There are rumors in the academy

39
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:13,660
Said it was late at night

40
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,128
Don't leave the house

41
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:17,530
If someone knocks on the door after dark

42
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:19,532
Don't open the door casually

43
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:21,467
If I

44
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,136
What will happen if you leave the house?

45
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:26,005
If you go out at night

46
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,841
Afraid of losing money

47
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,544
Even encounter unexpected events

48
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,448
How could there be such a rumor?

49
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:36,249
So scary

50
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,884
I’m not sure about this either.

51
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:40,320
But after all, the academy is built on a mountain

52
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,287
Weak students

53
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,389
It will inevitably attract the covetousness of animals

54
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,125
It's better to stay indoors when it gets dark

55
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:47,927
That's natural

56
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,975
This is the studio arranged by the academy

57
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:02,942
All cleaned

58
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,099
Safety

59
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,368
This is

60
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,469
book boy

61
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:30,570
All like this

62
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,405
Are they all like this?

63
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,441
That

64
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,443
I'll take Brother Wei to the lecture hall tomorrow

65
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,579
If there's nothing else, I'll take my leave now.

66
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,382
What are you going to do in the lecture hall tomorrow?

67
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:43,182
Class

68
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,083
Still have to go to class

69
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:46,586
Didn’t you come to the academy to study?

70
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,520
he will go

71
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:48,521
sorry to bother you

72
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,188
I

73
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,790
It's okay. See you tomorrow.

74
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,068
Really want to go

75
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:02,869
nonsense

76
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,103
Aren't you pretending to be a student?

77
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,338
How can you pretend not to listen to the class?

78
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:06,839
I dont go

79
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,441
I can't stand it

80
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,277
How about I become a book boy?

81
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:12,545
That's too late

82
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:13,413
Okay, okay.

83
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,081
I think you shouldn't be too angry

84
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,082
I'm not angry

85
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,450
Then you have to do a good job of pretending

86
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,120
Pretend to be sick

87
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:23,823
yes

88
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,426
I can be sick

89
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:28,328
Just get used to him

90
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,930
He's really not good at reading.

91
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,332
I'm really not

92
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:39,605
Say less.

93
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,307
make her angry

94
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:52,385
what

95
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,022
They really look like a family of three.

96
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:11,804
nobody

97
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:19,545
Come

98
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,382
Brother Wang, let me tell you

99
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:23,950
I'm in the backyard today

100
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,051
saw a chicken

101
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:26,319
And the dead uncle

102
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,587
That one looks particularly similar

103
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,256
But then it disappeared

104
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:31,657
I saw Si Qixing

105
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:32,859
Where is it?

106
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:33,659
Right here

107
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,095
Really in the academy

108
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:36,863
Where are the people?

109
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:39,098
If you don't see me, I'll wait here

110
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,800
See if he will show up again

111
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:41,868
Didn't he?

112
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,771
Never appeared again

113
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,006
So what did he say?

114
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,107
He advised us

115
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,009
Leave the academy

116
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,778
Why

117
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:52,845
have no idea

118
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,281
This thing is weird

119
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,450
or

120
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,185
Let’s meet up with Sister Zhao and the others first.

121
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:00,286
Let's discuss together

122
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:02,054
Good

123
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,068
Fear

124
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:19,539
This yard is weird

125
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,807
As soon as the sun sets

126
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,608
There are no students in the dormitory

127
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,777
My aunt also told me not to go out at night

128
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:32,819
I am here

129
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:36,622
Let's go

130
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:07,887
Scared

131
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,623
It's too dark

132
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,124
I'm too timid

133
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,129
Sorrow and sorrow are common to all people

134
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:18,564
It's fine

135
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,868
Brother Wang, are you also afraid?

136
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:22,668
Yes

137
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,606
So what are you afraid of? Can you say it?

138
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:29,642
Say it further

139
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,377
Afraid of the suffering in the world

140
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:32,578
People's livelihood is difficult

141
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,281
Let’s talk about it closer

142
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,253
Afraid of life and death

143
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,188
especially you

144
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:45,858
You don't have to be afraid of this

145
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,293
I won't leave

146
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,349
cool enough

147
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:15,588
Yanei

148
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:19,559
Yanei

149
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,460
what are you doing

150
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,262
Leave me alone I'm going to get sick

151
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,164
Why

152
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:26,265
Otherwise tomorrow

153
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:27,366
I want to go to the lecture hall to study

154
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,868
It's better to let me die

155
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:30,803
You guys go in first

156
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:31,637
I will try again

157
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:33,573
Yanei

158
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:36,242
you don't like reading

159
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,376
Maybe it's not the book's fault

160
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:38,978
The so-called gentleman is not vigilant

161
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:39,946
The tall building will collapse

162
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,614
You should be comfortable from within

163
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,123
Wet from within

164
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,628
Come, come, come

165
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:56,929
Lift it slowly, lift it slowly

166
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,598
Does it hurt?

167
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:00,099
came back

168
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:02,201
Is it better?

169
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,837
What's wrong with Sister Zhao?

170
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:06,839
Angry at the office

171
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,041
Is it because of illness?

172
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:11,377
Let him take a lesson

173
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:12,845
It's like it's killing him.

174
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:16,682
really

175
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,718
There's no need to really pour cold water on it

176
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,453
Just pretend to be sick and you'll be fine

177
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,254
Don't talk nonsense

178
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:29,562
He said

179
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,063
Afraid of being seen through by others

180
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,000
Sometimes there are times in the office

181
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,368
Really stubborn

182
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,003
Yeah, don’t listen to anything you say

183
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:39,238
Xue Ying

184
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:40,806
Aren’t you able to talk to Yanei?

185
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,174
How about you go and persuade him?

186
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:43,843
I don't advise

187
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:45,845
Why

188
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:47,947
I was going to persuade him

189
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:48,848
Result Question

190
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,282
The book boy also has to follow the class

191
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:52,918
I support Yanei on this matter

192
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,121
Listen

193
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:57,123
Take a look

194
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,458
You should say something

195
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:00,960
say something

196
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,298
I'm in Yushu Pavilion

197
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:07,867
I saw Si Weixing

198
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,573
from internal dampness from internal dampness

199
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,978
Isn’t it better to wear less clothes?

200
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,183
Who?

201
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,823
Didn’t you say you shouldn’t go out at night?

202
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:43,335
Dead Ghost Uncle

203
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:44,537
Just so mindlessly

204
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,371
Said a few words

205
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,572
Then the person disappeared

206
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,207
Didn't show up again after that

207
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,209
I guess I saw Pollux.

208
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:51,043
I think so

209
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:52,278
River Star

210
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,446
If you really want to see us

211
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:54,947
Just show up and it'll be fine

212
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:58,417
The Mystery of Pollux

213
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,052
Bought by a prodigal

214
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,761
What are these?

215
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,563
these numbers

216
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:14,500
he knows what it is

217
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:17,536
have no idea

218
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:19,405
completion

219
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:20,840
Wang Kuan doesn’t even know

220
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,774
Can't figure it out

221
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:22,541
But I always feel

222
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,409
these numbers

223
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,810
deja vu

224
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:31,684
Can not remember

225
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,222
Such complex numbers

226
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,223
If you have seen it

227
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:38,858
It should be a deep memory, right?

228
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,862
Explain that when I see these numbers

229
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,163
It feels normal

230
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:45,364
Only then will it be swept away

231
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:46,332
never remembered

232
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:47,299
The key is

233
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:47,933
who would think

234
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,168
These numbers are normal

235
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,336
yes

236
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,171
why

237
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:54,807
Chief

238
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,541
what

239
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:58,144
Someone is looking for you outside

240
00:12:58,477 --> 00:12:59,211
Who to look for

241
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:02,681
Find parents

242
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:07,419
Came to your door so quickly

243
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,426
Come here so late

244
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:15,861
clean

245
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:18,898
I'm waiting to do some chores in the academy

246
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:19,932
heard about you

247
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,767
A family of three only came to the academy

248
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:23,969
Came here specially to see you

249
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,908
Don’t leave your house after late at night

250
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,677
If someone knocks on the door after dark

251
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,412
Don't open the door casually

252
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,383
Since I came here specially

253
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:38,984
Something has to happen

254
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:42,721
Dare I ask if the three of them are locals?

255
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:46,492
It’s not that we came here because of its reputation

256
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:47,860
That'll be easy

257
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,399
Have those three people ever heard of it?

258
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:55,534
Jinghu South Road

259
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,269
There is always disaster

260
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,772
That's a demonic disaster running rampant

261
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,008
So scary

262
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:06,579
this

263
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,881
All those who come to the academy are talented people

264
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,150
That is also the future of the Song Dynasty

265
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:13,219
Those of us who are servants

266
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:14,887
Just thinking about it every day

267
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,655
We should protect these students

268
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:19,859
Only worthy of being born in the Song Dynasty

269
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:25,931
amazing

270
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:29,401
This gentleman

271
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,371
Although there are disasters in this world

272
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,206
But there are ways to deal with it

273
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,108
Our side

274
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,244
Can you have an adventure?

275
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:39,845
Unknown

276
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,146
Master and Madam

277
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,015
I would like to go and have a look together

278
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:45,851
At this moment

279
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:50,122
If you go out at night, you will lose money.

280
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,424
Even encounter unexpected events

281
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,127
Master and Madam

282
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,863
We can go whenever we want

283
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:59,498
It doesn't have to be today.

284
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:01,967
That's it for now

285
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:05,638
I just heard you say so much

286
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,039
I'm really curious

287
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:08,774
Is it convenient now?

288
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:10,743
convenient

289
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:13,979
Of course convenient

290
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:15,347
only

291
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,717
The young master still has homework tomorrow

292
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,120
I don’t want to disturb you two from resting.

293
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:26,458
he's fine

294
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,893
Let him stay here and read

295
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:29,962
Can we go together?

296
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,966
That's the best

297
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:43,342
That's it for both of them

298
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,410
Go with these people

299
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,477
Something's wrong with these people

300
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:47,746
Really no need

301
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,214
Are you following Sister Zhao and the others?

302
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:50,382
Still worried about them

303
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:51,884
To say something is wrong

304
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:53,519
They won't lose to anyone

305
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,121
Too

306
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:00,960
I have this puzzle

307
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,162
See if there is a way to crack it

308
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,399
Why do you two have to dress up like this?

309
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,701
Bought everything

310
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:08,968
that is

311
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,135
I always have to find a chance to wear it.

312
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,204
Do you two believe in gods and demons?

313
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:14,640
Do you believe in gods and demons?

314
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,141
Not a big problem

315
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:18,243
Then we believe

316
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,246
That's right

317
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,147
Where is this academy?

318
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:22,948
Everything is fine

319
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:23,983
These are the students

320
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,117
for such things

321
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:26,652
No sense of awe

322
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,253
Students don’t believe it

323
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,254
Who says it's not?

324
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:30,122
so

325
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:31,390
Find us

326
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,825
Be a father and a mother

327
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:36,462
Really accurate

328
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:37,529
We especially believe

329
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:38,697
special letter

330
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,299
That's great.

331
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:41,800
You two, please come with me

332
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:42,267
Walk

333
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,103
now please allow me

334
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,205
A grand introduction to the two of you

335
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,907
The real god in this academy

336
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,847
Please take a look, you two

337
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:03,789
One worship

338
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,494
Two bows

339
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:12,564
Three Prostrations

340
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,439
Dare those heads in the Inn

341
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:21,807
Everyone is waiting here

342
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,386
We have searched all over the world for this

343
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:35,621
Just found these

344
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,656
Spiritual stone figurine god

345
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,091
Don't hide it from both of you.

346
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,826
Eliminate disaster and avoid disaster

347
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,094
Bless all living beings

348
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:43,729
As the saying goes

349
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:45,864
Whatever you ask for

350
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,807
awesome

351
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:59,211
There is no proof for what you say. Please take a look.

352
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,584
What about this person?

353
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,585
Come to the academy too

354
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,853
A handyman

355
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,987
But since he was a child

356
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,222
these legs

357
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:11,757
I can't walk

358
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,063
It should be treated

359
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,934
But how to cure a stubborn disease born from birth?

360
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:23,469
Moreover

361
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:24,903
He grew up in a poor family

362
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,405
He can't afford it.

363
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:31,610
Poor

364
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,878
It's too awful

365
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,246
Fortunately, fortunately

366
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,415
He has found faith now.

367
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:37,483
Ready to sacrifice

368
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:39,384
Please watch

369
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,488
What miracle happened after the sacrifice?

370
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:43,222
Wait a minute

371
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:45,757
Since that

372
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,292
he can't walk

373
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,328
What did the academy hire him to do?

374
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,866
The academy is so compassionate

375
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,100
Yeah

376
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,536
The Academy Master is kind-hearted

377
00:18:58,403 --> 00:18:59,838
Does he live near here?

378
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,040
no no

379
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,909
Live quite far away

380
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,144
He lives so far

381
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,478
How did the academy find him?

382
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,813
And hired him

383
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,450
this this

384
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:13,719
The academy is world-famous

385
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,255
He admires this in his heart

386
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:17,489
Came by myself

387
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,359
Just to do some work

388
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:22,528
I also want to take this opportunity to learn how to read and write.

389
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:24,229
right

390
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,464
Came by myself

391
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:26,498
awesome

392
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,300
you do not say

393
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:30,269
how come

394
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:32,237
this

395
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:33,338
Take a carriage?

396
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:34,773
How can it be

397
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,441
Everyone said that my family is poor

398
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:37,342
How is it possible to ride in a carriage?

399
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,577
This is not important

400
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:39,278
I see

401
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:39,878
What

402
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,346
He crawled here by himself

403
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:42,614
Have perseverance

404
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:43,482
Really

405
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:45,384
Yes, yes, that's it

406
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:46,518
Look at the one in our family again

407
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,853
Look at other people's attitudes

408
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,922
What a sin

409
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:50,789
Anxious

410
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,224
What about those two people?

411
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:53,425
sacrifice

412
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,928
Sacrifice can usher in a turning point

413
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,129
Awaken the Miracle

414
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:58,997
The so-called sacrifice

415
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,466
Close relatives should be used

416
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:03,001
fortunately

417
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,102
There are

418
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,904
Holy objects can be substituted

419
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,639
This is the holy thing

420
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,443
In exchange for three thousand strings

421
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:16,815
Not expensive

422
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:17,883
Not expensive

423
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:18,784
That's right, that's right

424
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,286
Such grace is priceless

425
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:27,459
Please take a look, you two

426
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,887
So green

427
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,422
This is the fire of the gods

428
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:59,258
The sacrifice came true

429
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,926
awesome

430
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:06,665
There is a reaction

431
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,599
There is a reaction

432
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:20,879
How about it

433
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:34,760
Seems like there's a reaction

434
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:35,861
have a feeling

435
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:53,378
This is good

436
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,348
I stood up

437
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:57,983
stood up

438
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,290
My legs are healed

439
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,125
God is obviously enlightened

440
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:08,927
The sacrifice came true

441
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:11,963
The sacrifice came true

442
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,933
Well, this is the power of sacrifice

443
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,201
fulfilled

444
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:18,970
Eiko

445
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:20,005
fulfilled

446
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:20,972
fulfilled

447
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,210
Good good good

448
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:26,812
spinner

449
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:30,949
Shuangfeiyan

450
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:32,918
good

451
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:33,919
well

452
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,421
My legs are healed

453
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:38,724
Thank God

454
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:41,493
Can we make a sacrifice?

455
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:43,061
all right

456
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:45,263
Just exchange money for holy objects

457
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,565
After the sacrifice

458
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:49,601
Can be exchanged for children’s gold list title

459
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:50,769
academically successful

460
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,505
It doesn't sound interesting

461
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:56,842
Can I change it to another one?

462
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,844
Immune to all diseases

463
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:00,379
Immortality

464
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,748
OK

465
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,317
This and such a wish

466
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,619
Requires three holy objects

467
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,988
Let me do the math on this.

468
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,858
Nine thousand strings is enough

469
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:15,527
If there is no cash

470
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,562
You can offer gold, silver, and jade

471
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:19,931
Why use money?

472
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:21,299
This is the rule

473
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:22,868
Didn't you just say

474
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:23,602
holy object

475
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:24,803
Better to sacrifice

476
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:26,004
A close relative

477
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,006
It can be

478
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:29,641
But it's not necessary

479
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:31,743
How about I sacrifice my son?

480
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,278
Good idea

481
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:35,814
Why are you two doing this?

482
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,583
It's okay, you don't have to be reluctant

483
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,018
He is not my biological child

484
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:40,485
Not biological

485
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:41,787
Why can't I bear it?

486
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:42,587
this

487
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:44,689
After all, it’s a human life

488
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:47,058
Holy objects can be used in place of living people

489
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:49,461
There is really no need to burn the son.

490
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:51,029
This this

491
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,664
Can holy objects be used?

492
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:53,365
OK

493
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,138
The sacred objects are burned with my son.

494
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,774
Will the effect be doubled?

495
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:05,377
confused

496
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,012
Look at that stove

497
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:08,680
too small

498
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,215
Our Wayne can't fit it in

499
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,983
You can chop him into pieces first

500
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,688
It's totally unnecessary

501
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:21,493
as far as I know

502
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:22,260
Second place

503
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,328
In the academy

504
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:24,129
To the son

505
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:25,230
Ordered one

506
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:26,731
The most expensive house

507
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:28,667
visible

508
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:30,001
Rich family fortune

509
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,370
Look at it like this in exchange for a holy object

510
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:34,172
The best strategy

511
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:41,746
so be it

512
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:42,614
So be it

513
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:47,652
Let me ask one more question

514
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:49,020
Please say

515
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:52,157
Was the academy responsible for the sacrifice?

516
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,326
No, no.

517
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,694
Such a big thing

518
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:58,296
It was created by a great sage

519
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:00,265
This person's name is unknown

520
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:01,766
But there is a nickname

521
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:02,734
Name

522
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,804
Beihe Xingjun

523
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:10,509
Then can we see with our own eyes

524
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,878
Go meet this North River Star Lord

525
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,380
Then it depends on fate

526
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,616
As long as two of you buy and exchange holy items

527
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:18,884
Sacrifice sincerely

528
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:21,987
There's always a chance

529
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:26,358
All your wishes come true

530
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:27,759
Thinking about Polaris

531
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:28,860
The news is coming

532
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:31,463
Do you think it’s Polaris?

533
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:32,397
A scam?

534
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,333
It has something to do with the disaster gods and demons.

535
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,168
But before I saw Polaris

536
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:38,803
It's hard to draw a conclusion

537
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,170
no trace to be found

538
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,238
Extremely skilled

539
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:15,574
What's wrong

540
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,210
Your father's letter

541
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:29,421
Co-authored now one by one

542
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,855
Did you jump out by yourself?

543
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:48,373
This is the academy

544
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:49,341
To the kitchen helper

545
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:50,709
temporary accommodation

546
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:55,981
Okay, Brother Wang.

547
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:57,882
You should go back quickly too

548
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:23,908
You should go back soon

549
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:25,210
Let's see you tomorrow

550
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:27,846
go to bed early

551
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:13,091
Brother Wang

552
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:17,962
This residence

553
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,197
Only you

554
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:22,400
Auntie doesn’t live in the academy

555
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:23,935
Since I'm afraid

556
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:25,170
Why don't you tell me

557
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:28,840
I am also a member of Qizhai

558
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:30,208
You have to bear it yourself

559
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,100
Lie down

560
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:32,971
I'll wait until you fall asleep before leaving

561
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,038
Can I fall asleep?

562
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,415
Why don't you sit down for a while?

563
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,167
I can chase away nightmares here

564
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:37,602
Sleep peacefully

565
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,578
The man recovered from his leg injury

566
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,281
Pretend to be a fool and cheat people out of money

567
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:25,183
But it's all green fire

568
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,285
means of playing tricks

569
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:28,486
From the bones of old graves

570
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:29,287
you can find out

571
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:31,322
If you give it a little heat, there will be green fire

572
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,657
Used to scare people

573
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,458
It won't hurt anyone at all.

574
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:34,759
Find it from the bones

575
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:35,860
Hard to find

576
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:37,128
but

577
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:38,897
There are other ways

578
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:39,864
any solution

579
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:43,268
never mind

580
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:44,535
Even if I tell you, you don’t want to know.

581
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:45,904
Tell me about it

582
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,240
Steaming human urine

583
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,642
You can also find this thing

584
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:52,343
Steaming human urine

585
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:53,444
this method

586
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:54,812
Who discovered it first?

587
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:56,080
Probably a doctor

588
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:57,615
Why

589
00:31:58,349 --> 00:31:59,384
After all, it’s a medicine.

590
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:01,085
Urine can be used as medicine

591
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,055
It is recorded in medical books

592
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:05,123
It can cure many diseases.

593
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:07,091
Pain due to colic, fatigue, thirst, irritability

594
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:08,426
Both are useful

595
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:09,560
You know this

596
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,096
When I was a kid, I had to learn everything.

597
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,097
You have to know everything

598
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:15,533
Otherwise, I really wouldn’t be alive now

599
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:17,602
Then when will you

600
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,670
Take me to play too

601
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:19,771
Green fire

602
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:21,839
Then you have to start now

603
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:22,707
Just start collecting

604
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:23,908
All kinds of human urine

605
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:26,077
Let's get down to business.

606
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,480
What happened to your father's letter?

607
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:39,190
Let me see

608
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,731
I’ll meet you at Yuelu Mountain tomorrow

609
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:48,066
Not necessarily true

610
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,101
You'll know it when you see it

611
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:51,936
Okay, I'll go with you.

612
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:52,470
Need not

613
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:53,504
I'll go with Zhao Jian

614
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:54,572
Just you two

615
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,007
No need to use your hands

616
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:57,008
After all, it is still

617
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:58,543
Want to borrow his identity

618
00:32:58,543 --> 00:32:59,777
Find an opportunity to get close to Yuan Hao

619
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:00,979
So there is no need to show up

620
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,480
Things tonight

621
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,182
Be sure to tell Wang Kuan and Xiao Jing

622
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:05,917
Also

623
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:07,719
Continue well tomorrow

624
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:08,820
Pretending to be a student

625
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:12,290
What time is it and we are still chatting?

626
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,625
There will be no class tomorrow

627
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:18,896
Can't chat anymore. Can't chat anymore.

628
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:19,998
Long nights and many dreams

629
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:21,265
Xiao Xue

630
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:22,333
Let's tell now

631
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,101
Wang Kuan and Xiao Jing

632
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:24,502
Let's go

633
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,281
They won't be here tomorrow

634
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,082
Just pretending to be sick

635
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,217
Have you figured out how to dress it up?

636
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:41,586
What kind of illness are you pretending to be?

637
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:46,157
I'm most afraid of this thing

638
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:47,358
Protect me, Xiao Xue

639
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,264
Why is it so dark?

640
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:54,132
Go fast

641
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:12,784
Go do your own thing

642
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,760
Want to learn to cook

643
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,266
I have someone I like

644
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:29,400
I want to make it for him to eat

645
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:32,804
yes

646
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,205
Wait a moment while I cut the meat

647
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:35,173
You help

648
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,574
Thank you, aunt

649
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:38,509
It was the same when I was young

650
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,411
Have someone you like

651
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:41,579
Just learned to cook

652
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:42,747
I want to make it for him to eat

653
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,282
So are you married?

654
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:44,982
It's done

655
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:47,018
have a daughter

656
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:50,388
bigger than you

657
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:51,722
That's great.

658
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:54,292
you live near here

659
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:56,360
Right, that village in the mountains

660
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,895
No wonder I go home every day

661
00:34:58,463 --> 00:34:59,864
It's quite hard, right?

662
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:01,265
Gotta take care of the house

663
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,600
There is no work at home

664
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:04,302
Quite relaxing

665
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:07,138
It's my uncle who is taking care of the house.

666
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,439
Not really

667
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,775
Everyone in the family is dead

668
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,110
There is only one mother-in-law left

669
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,377
There's nothing to do

670
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,614
how come

671
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:17,782
Be in trouble

672
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:19,851
drought disease

673
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:22,120
When I came to the academy

674
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,654
passing a village

675
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,723
I saw someone worshiping the Dragon God

676
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:27,024
This is our village

677
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,860
I saw the faucet fell off

678
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,361
Was cut off

679
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:31,829
It turned out that when I worshiped God

680
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:34,165
Praying for rain to ward off disasters has been quite successful.

681
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:35,867
But this dragon's head was chopped off

682
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,468
The disaster cannot be controlled

683
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:39,537
Everyone in the village is gone

684
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,974
Who would do such a thing?

685
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,009
College students

686
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:47,612
What do college students do when they chop off the dragon's head?

687
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:49,447
heard about it

688
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,249
Is that the devil from Polaris?

689
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:52,984
Him

690
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,218
Bewitch students

691
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:55,653
Dedicated to destroying gods

692
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:57,522
caused this disaster

693
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:01,459
Why does Pollux do this?

694
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:05,863
He is a devil

695
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,331
born bad

696
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:10,268
You have to keep an eye out

697
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:12,370
In our academy

698
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,638
Too many students

699
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:15,406
They were all bewitched by him

700
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,241
You can't tell on the surface

701
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:19,744
You should pay more attention to yourself at ordinary times

702
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:58,816
It's time for Mr. Wei to go to class

703
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:06,157
where to

704
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,364
book boy

705
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:14,098
it's me

706
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:19,971
The young master is sick

707
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:22,306
Kill the chicken and make soup

708
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:52,270
Brother Wei, what's going on?

709
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:58,542
Si Jiu

710
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:00,811
Why is this so sick?

711
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:04,382
Are you going to attend a lecture?

712
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:05,483
Don't show off

713
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:06,317
Health is important

714
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,818
Stayed up late last night reading

715
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:09,053
Scared by bats

716
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,588
I still have a headache now

717
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:14,458
I'm so distraught that I don't want to live anymore.

718
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:17,161
What about your father and mother?

719
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:18,863
Go out for a walk

720
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:20,331
Wander around

721
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:22,333
You are so sick now

722
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:25,069
After all, they are not biological parents.

723
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:28,372
What a blessing

724
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:30,141
What did you say

725
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:33,244
I mean

726
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:35,680
Brother Wayne's ill-fated

727
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,182
Biological parents are no longer alive

728
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:40,484
If I get bitten by a bat again

729
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,888
Fortunately, I was just scared

730
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:44,689
Nothing serious

731
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:47,358
I feel bad

732
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:49,960
splitting headache

733
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:51,429
Si Jiu

734
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:53,164
I'm afraid I won't be able to read today

735
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:54,899
There is a doctor in the academy

736
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:56,100
How about I invite you?

737
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:57,301
Get a pulse for the young master

738
00:38:58,202 --> 00:38:58,769
Need not

739
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,372
Have taken medicine

740
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,407
Don't take this medicine randomly.

741
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,377
My scholar boy is very knowledgeable in medical skills

742
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,086
Where can I find such a book boy?

743
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:18,889
Taught by my family since childhood

744
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:21,959
Brother Wayne really has a family background.

745
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:25,629
such a pity

746
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:27,998
I can't get up

747
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,600
Why do you want to get up?

748
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:31,769
I want to go to the lecture hall

749
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:33,971
I want to attend class

750
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:35,539
There is actually something in this world

751
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,241
Such a studious person

752
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:40,344
If you don’t study, you’d rather die.

753
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:49,420
What a pity

754
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:50,988
Really can't get up

755
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:53,124
Come

756
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:54,558
Let's take one side

757
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,494
Carry Brother Wei to the lecture hall

758
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:57,928
I'm afraid it's inappropriate.

759
00:39:58,629 --> 00:39:59,964
After all, I'm still sick

760
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:02,500
Didn't you listen to your young master?

761
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,502
If you don’t study, you’d rather die.

762
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:06,137
So eager to learn

763
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:07,405
How can I live up to it?

764
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,839
Come on, let's carry it

765
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:10,775
this

766
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:11,509
how

767
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,677
I want to go

768
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:14,979
only

769
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:18,549
I'm a little heavy

770
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:19,817
Not afraid

771
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:27,625
I really want to go

772
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,260
But I'm really heavy

773
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,361
The two of us carry it

774
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:31,462
I'm weak

775
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:35,499
Can't help

776
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:37,701
I want to study

777
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,403
I'm afraid it's not possible now.

778
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:46,577
Okay, I'll carry you.

779
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:47,378
Come

780
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:53,717
help me

781
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:08,566
The scenery is pretty good

782
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,868
Nervous

783
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:15,372
A little bit

784
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,141
I know

785
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:18,843
After all, they are father and son

786
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:21,412
He never took me

787
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:22,213
Been a son

788
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:26,217
That's what he owes you

789
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:12,429
This is the head of the Yuan family

790
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:16,100
Yuantianguan of Chiyou Banner in those days

791
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:20,905
Shouldn't have met on the mountain

792
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:24,441
I’m too old to climb mountains.

793
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,679
I heard that you defected to Xixia

794
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:31,615
how

795
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:35,819
met father

796
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:38,389
Shouldn't I say hello first?

797
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,825
Just because you surrendered to Xixia

798
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:42,693
Almost hurt me

799
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:43,928
The head was chopped off

800
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:46,163
Not only are you not dead

801
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:48,766
Also came to Tanzhou

802
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:49,667
Came for you

803
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:51,368
Desperate

804
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:53,504
You have to find a way out by yourself

805
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:55,339
Want to rely on me

806
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:58,509
Save your life

807
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:00,678
Take her with you

808
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:02,379
No way

809
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:04,048
Engaged

810
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:05,215
Have to follow

811
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:08,085
Engaged

812
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:15,426
good taste

813
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,293
Okay

814
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:18,562
There's no need to be modest

815
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:21,765
Anyway

816
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:24,468
It's always a good thing when father and son reunite

817
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:26,337
I won’t embarrass you either

818
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:28,305
you killed her

819
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,108
I believe you

820
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:34,645
how

821
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,782
Don't play the trick of pretending to be dead

822
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:40,117
Fool me

823
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:44,822
Change the conditions

824
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:08,245
Xixia people
