1
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:51,177
I am a witness

2
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:53,780
who is he

3
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,381
Why did he appear in the Yuan family?

4
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:56,683
How do you know Yu Chiyuan?

5
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:57,650
How can I follow you?

6
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,351
Come together

7
00:01:58,351 --> 00:01:59,953
I was also entrusted

8
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,188
The Yuan family who followed Yu Chiyuan

9
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:04,457
Who asked for it?

10
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:05,792
Yanei

11
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,527
Have you ever thought about a question

12
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:08,361
What

13
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:09,929
I said

14
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,832
Treason is a crime punishable by execution

15
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,101
Even the princess, you don’t care about him

16
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,603
What's the use of having him?

17
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,472
He will be taken to the execution ground soon

18
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,241
beheading

19
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,842
Xiaolu Zhangyuan might as well hurry up

20
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,245
You have to be quick

21
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:27,847
As you wish

22
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:29,582
Is there a problem with this?

23
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:30,850
The death penalty of my Song Dynasty

24
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,352
The process is very complicated

25
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:33,786
It can't be done in three days

26
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,588
Right, so I went out of the city to kill him.

27
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,023
There is a law

28
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:38,591
Whether in the city or outside the city

29
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,927
It's impossible to kill people at will

30
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,030
So this is

31
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,465
A lynching in Lu Nanshan

32
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:46,900
Rikunanzan Present

33
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,034
The new president

34
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:49,435
Entered the Privy Council again

35
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:50,837
It can be said that the future is bright

36
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,138
do you think he will

37
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:53,339
Are you so easily impulsive?

38
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:55,341
Besides, things like lynching

39
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,242
Once revealed

40
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:57,844
What's his future?

41
00:02:58,144 --> 00:02:59,712
There's no benefit in killing me

42
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:00,847
yes

43
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,682
Think about it again

44
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:03,683
Why would he let

45
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,018
Yuchiyuan looked at me

46
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:06,886
Mingming Yuchiyuan’s testimony

47
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:07,687
Already said

48
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,688
He has a grudge against the Yuan family

49
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,089
Isn't he afraid?

50
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,457
Wei Chiyuan in prison

51
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,126
Take revenge on me

52
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,227
Kill me

53
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,029
Then after I die

54
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:17,730
How else can the Yuan family investigate?

55
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,033
So this is unreasonable

56
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:21,801
Yanei

57
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,469
I give you those lessons

58
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:24,404
do you remember

59
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,273
last night

60
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:28,608
why don't i see you

61
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:29,909
Yes why

62
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:32,145
Because this matter of the Yuan family is very involved

63
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,147
I was thinking of finding a way on my own

64
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:35,348
Don't drag you into the water

65
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:36,583
Can you understand?

66
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,283
understand

67
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,386
But now Yuan Zhongxin said

68
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,354
let me find you

69
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:42,689
Let's help rob the prison together

70
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:43,823
Can you understand?

71
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:44,924
clear

72
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:50,196
I also understood

73
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,031
You don't understand

74
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,034
All the classes in the Secret Pavilion were in vain.

75
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:56,169
Think about it yourself

76
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:57,103
As a lesson

77
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,008
Such a big crime for Yuan Zhongxin

78
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,876
But he wants to drag everyone into the water together

79
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,745
This is not in line with his behavior

80
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:07,714
So from that moment on

81
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:08,581
I knew it

82
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,350
There is something wrong with this execution

83
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,351
The Law of Calamity

84
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:12,752
It won't hurt anyone

85
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,120
All the unreasonable

86
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:15,922
In fact, it is the same as

87
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,425
The same person who entrusted this gentleman to

88
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:21,794
is the same answer

89
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,119
So Headmaster Xiao Lu already knew

90
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,754
Yuchiyuan is a disciple of the Yuan family

91
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,322
So let Yuchiyuan guard you

92
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:50,790
this lynching

93
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,358
There will also be subsequent tribulation fields

94
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,861
All for one purpose

95
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,996
Let Yuchiyuan kidnap Yuan Zhongxin

96
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,364
use this opportunity

97
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:00,366
Find out the whereabouts of Yuan Zhongxin’s father

98
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:01,601
There are results

99
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,435
In Tanzhou

100
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,469
Tanzhou

101
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,139
Be more specific

102
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:06,839
the day after tomorrow

103
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,742
The day after tomorrow Yu Chiyuan

104
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:11,878
Take me to find someone in person

105
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:16,182
Go south to Tanzhou

106
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:17,950
I'm with you

107
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,859
Thanks a lot this time

108
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,263
The Lu family is kind to me

109
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,498
I want to repay this favor.

110
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,669
How many more favors do you owe me?

111
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,344
the last time

112
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,446
Go south to Tanzhou

113
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,714
Please come with us

114
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,049
Why do you let me go with you?

115
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:51,150
have you seen him

116
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,487
Finish helping this time

117
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:55,888
Neither owes each other

118
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:57,523
Can

119
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:03,863
The execution ground is indeed a lynching

120
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:06,766
But put you in jail

121
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:07,500
This up and down

122
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,668
But everyone knows

123
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:09,669
nonsense

124
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,071
People are put in prison and guarded by the military

125
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,306
It's strange that the above doesn't know

126
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:14,140
so

127
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,242
Cha Yuan's family plots rebellion

128
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:17,744
There has to be a result

129
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,112
Let’s go to Tanzhou together

130
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:20,480
is the result

131
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:22,882
The court is fake

132
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,117
But arresting you is real.

133
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,752
Report it to the police now

134
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:28,154
It was you who escaped from prison

135
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:29,555
Why

136
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,023
Threat

137
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,159
If I want to clear my name

138
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,661
You have to help him catch someone

139
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,463
You don't believe Yuan Zhongxin

140
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:38,398
certainly

141
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,800
Who named him Yuan?

142
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,404
Okay, there's no need to be angry.

143
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,007
I understand

144
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,714
If you run halfway

145
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,517
This charge of treason

146
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,485
I can't clean it up in my life

147
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:01,687
I see

148
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:07,527
very good

149
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,166
You are the son of Yuan Tianguan

150
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,233
you know him

151
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,568
Former colleague

152
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,471
May I ask what your identity is?

153
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,241
See you the day after tomorrow

154
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:26,646
Been making trouble for a long time

155
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:27,747
Everyone is in the pit

156
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:28,981
Yu Chiyuan is alone

157
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,617
Then you and Yuan Zhongxin

158
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,318
That time in the woods

159
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:33,486
He is also deceiving Yu Chiyuan.

160
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,156
If Yuan Zhongxin fails to gain trust

161
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,124
Me and Xiao Jing

162
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,592
Will take the opportunity to get close to Yu Chiyuan

163
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,363
Don't you lie?

164
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,499
I didn't lie in the woods

165
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,468
Didn’t he deceive Yuchiyuan?

166
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:50,470
You let him speak for himself

167
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:53,239
You do the math

168
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:54,841
I said a few words in total

169
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,610
you are hurt badly

170
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:58,478
Please explain

171
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,479
Give you a chance to explain

172
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:00,513
No need

173
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,114
Why don't you leave here with me first?

174
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,116
The chief does not have to be like this

175
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:04,984
This sentence is long

176
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:06,953
Don't you feel guilty for shouting?

177
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,087
I have a clear conscience

178
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,589
What did I say that I lied about?

179
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:13,726
Small Scene

180
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,361
you have to be careful

181
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:16,362
What's wrong

182
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,198
Your Wang Kuan is so bad

183
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,235
He is the best in the world

184
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:25,872
You are done

185
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:36,315
Wait a minute

186
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,118
You made an appointment with Mr. Lu

187
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:39,986
meet here

188
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:40,753
yes

189
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,722
How did Wang Kuan know that?

190
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:43,990
He was still waiting here in advance

191
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,625
I was reminded in the woods

192
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,859
What did you remind him of?

193
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:51,464
The human heart is more dangerous than Yu Yuan

194
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:52,798
Such people

195
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,200
God knows he will do it again

196
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,234
What kind of thing is coming

197
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:56,869
The sun enters Si of Yuyuan

198
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,237
Dawn at Menggu's Pond

199
00:08:58,337 --> 00:08:59,872
The place where Yu Yuan disappears

200
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,073
Isn't this night?

201
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,341
That's it

202
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:03,709
Yuan Zhongxin speaks

203
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,344
Never like rhetorical embellishments

204
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:07,380
Sudden elegance is inevitably abrupt

205
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,081
Why do you sound like you are scolding me?

206
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,483
He has another sentence

207
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:11,350
If it weren't for the

208
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,518
Someone tipped off the news

209
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,953
Lu Nanshan’s New Secret Pavilion

210
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,488
How could he fail in the Yuan family?

211
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,323
The Secret Pavilion has already changed

212
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:18,758
Such people

213
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:20,760
Stop talking about taking care of us

214
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,595
I'm afraid it's Qizhai's old place

215
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:23,829
I can’t even remember clearly

216
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,598
Suddenly mentioning the past and the old place

217
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:27,199
Not connected with the previous sentence

218
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,701
Plus Yu Yuan

219
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,636
I guess it just keeps me at night

220
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:31,871
Waiting in the old place of Qizhai

221
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,107
You can all guess this

222
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:38,110
How do you two usually talk?

223
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:39,478
It does not matter

224
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,714
First think about his crime of treason.

225
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,316
Yes, I’m going south this time

226
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:44,050
Must be washed out

227
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,217
His charge of treason

228
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:47,587
Actually

229
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:49,488
this is bad news

230
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:50,389
also good news

231
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:51,857
take the blame

232
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,326
How can this be considered good news?

233
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,728
The court is fake

234
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,363
That means your net worth

235
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,497
At least it's still innocent

236
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,200
To be honest, this time I went south

237
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,402
In fact, it's my own trouble

238
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:04,604
If you want to say

239
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,871
You go south alone

240
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:07,239
It's better not to say anything

241
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,241
That's not what I meant

242
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:10,876
I mean

243
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,244
Your net worth is still clean

244
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:13,145
What if I go south this time?

245
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:13,980
What trouble did you encounter?

246
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,181
Then it's up to you to support me.

247
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,716
Will I be safe this time?

248
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:17,883
It's all up to you guys.

249
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,128
I want to ask

250
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,196
Today's business

251
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,230
Is it finished?

252
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:32,298
Yes

253
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,767
I have a question that I have been holding back for a long time.

254
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,603
Sister Zhao heard that you are engaged

255
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:38,871
deal

256
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:43,009
But

257
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,644
Brother Yuan has been in prison all this time

258
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,245
Where did you make the appointment?

259
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:47,380
Right in the jail

260
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,316
From the beginning of the world to the present

261
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,585
No one gets engaged in prison, right?

262
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:53,886
That's not certain

263
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:55,321
If not

264
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:56,989
I'll set a precedent

265
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:02,595
Why don't you speak?

266
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:03,529
Excuse me

267
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,599
What's there to be embarrassed about?

268
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,367
We are not thieves

269
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:10,703
Sister Zhao

270
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:12,872
what happened

271
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,407
Please tell me in detail

272
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,077
What's there to say?

273
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:19,979
to be honest

274
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,347
I just love hearing this

275
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:05,991
Why aren't you sleeping yet?

276
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:08,527
Brother Wang

277
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,766
I'm really happy for them

278
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,868
Brother Yuan and Sister Zhao

279
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:16,569
both of them

280
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,570
experienced so much

281
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,738
Finally got the result

282
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:21,240
And Sister Zhao, she’s so awesome

283
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,008
Dare to think and do

284
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,111
I really envy them

285
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:27,046
do you know

286
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,647
Today I also begged Sister Zhao

287
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:29,715
I saw her and Brother Yuan

288
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:30,583
concentric knot

289
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,484
I think

290
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,319
That's nothing more than a rare treasure

291
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:34,487
All are precious

292
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:38,724
for you

293
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:51,237
Don't envy

294
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:53,639
You can also have

295
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,108
How did you get it?

296
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,209
Finger cut

297
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,577
But I can't

298
00:12:58,878 --> 00:12:59,879
You can also use a knife

299
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,315
Then I'll go find Sister Zhao to borrow a knife.

300
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:05,484
Then go to sleep

301
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:09,989
I have to travel far tomorrow

302
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,068
Do not be afraid

303
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,337
they are here to find me

304
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:09,508
come in

305
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:21,987
Which of you asks first?

306
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,424
You said Yuan Zhongxin’s father

307
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:27,226
I was your colleague

308
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,394
That year in Lu Guannian

309
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:29,828
Work under you

310
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,032
Is it convenient for you to tell me what I want to do?

311
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,669
Why was the Secret Pavilion established?

312
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:37,903
Fight against Xia Liao's spy

313
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:40,306
The Song Dynasty was founded for more than 80 years

314
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,440
have you ever thought about

315
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,641
before the secret pavilion

316
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,743
Who will fight against the enemy’s spies?

317
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:46,879
It's you

318
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,648
Long before the Secret Pavilion

319
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:50,950
Lu Guannian established

320
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,184
Your own spy

321
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,752
Select people at that time

322
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:55,587
Or choose among the military

323
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,589
Or choose a strange person among the people

324
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,359
Or

325
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:03,462
Prisoner

326
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,764
With training, you can meet the enemy

327
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,300
Your father and I are among them

328
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,104
and after

329
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:13,739
The so-called spy

330
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,709
Trapped in darkness and fighting endlessly

331
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,078
Years of fighting against the enemy

332
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,179
Countless casualties

333
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,581
Dead people

334
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:24,850
Can't even leave a name

335
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,319
It’s been a long time

336
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,355
People's hearts are floating

337
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:30,622
Some people think

338
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,791
Lu Guannian deliberately let us die

339
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,526
some people doubt

340
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,228
Lu Guannian is cruel and ruthless

341
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,130
Disregard for human life

342
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,065
so

343
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:42,501
Some have returned, some have reversed

344
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,873
Some want to kill Lu Guannian to vent their anger

345
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:50,075
What about you?

346
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:53,445
Of course I won't be right

347
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,114
Lao Zhangyuan did it

348
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,751
My life was given by him

349
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:03,188
you

350
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,524
He is also the son of Lu Zhangyuan

351
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:13,198
Just pretend he doesn't exist

352
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,002
That might be my misunderstanding

353
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,608
Fighting among colleagues

354
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,143
I got chills later

355
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,779
This is the result of fighting to the death

356
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,048
So I chose to quit

357
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,319
The commander has never said this before

358
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,021
Better to raise chickens

359
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:37,489
Not tired

360
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,024
Not tiring

361
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,130
Lu Guannian established the Secret Pavilion

362
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,699
Choose from teenagers

363
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,802
He is afraid of making the same mistake again

364
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,270
So to say

365
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,237
you are us

366
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,705
A true senior

367
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,507
I'm a useless person

368
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,210
What do you call your senior?

369
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,512
We used the stars as our sign

370
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,581
I belong to the Xusu Department

371
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:04,283
In the name of Si Wei

372
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,218
Si Weixing

373
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:06,952
That's right

374
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:08,987
Si Weixing

375
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,489
There is another name

376
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:11,590
Si Weixing

377
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,258
Also known as Si Gui in the Han Dynasty

378
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,326
devil

379
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:16,328
My cook used to

380
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:17,663
That’s how I call my housekeeper.

381
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,432
Don't tell me nonsense. It's not those two words.

382
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,770
Dead ghost is also good

383
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:26,038
right

384
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,806
I also feel like it’s called kindness

385
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,074
these two names

386
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:30,442
You can call me whatever you want

387
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:31,743
I will call you from now on

388
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:32,578
Dead Ghost Uncle

389
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:33,946
casual

390
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,117
I really have a talent for naming names.

391
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,620
Named after the stars

392
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:44,323
That

393
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,992
what is his name

394
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,193
The spy back then

395
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,529
In addition to the twenty-eight constellations

396
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,198
There are also some named after demon stars

397
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:58,303
Yuan Zhongxin, your father was

398
00:18:59,004 --> 00:18:59,905
It is known as

399
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,040
Chiyou Flag

400
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,275
Are you familiar with him?

401
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,043
Haven’t seen each other for many years

402
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:40,279
Yu Chiyuan said

403
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,948
Yuan Tianguan is looking for someone in Tanzhou

404
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,449
Who do you think he is looking for?

405
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:47,819
River Star

406
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,793
The Northern River Star

407
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:56,762
It's this one

408
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:57,796
Also a spy

409
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:58,664
That's right

410
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,366
This person is rarely seen

411
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:03,702
At that time Lu Guannian

412
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,903
Sent to Xixia and Daliao

413
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:06,038
Many hidden lines

414
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,473
After Lu Guannian's death

415
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,242
Who are these people?

416
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,276
What position did he hold?

417
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:12,711
Nobody knows

418
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,080
But as far as I know

419
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,181
In the hands of North River Star

420
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:17,983
There is a roster

421
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,987
Do you think he's looking for this roster?

422
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,922
So I agreed to go south

423
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,058
Yuantianguan took refuge in Xixia

424
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:27,259
this roster

425
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,528
We must not fall into his hands

426
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,748
All the spies back then were dead

427
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:51,516
Now our secret palace

428
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:53,018
Take up the mantle of our predecessors

429
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,754
If the roster really exists

430
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:57,556
We have the same answer

431
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,025
Never let this roster

432
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,526
fell into the hands of the Xixia people

433
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:05,631
Yuantianguan took refuge in Xixia

434
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:06,999
this roster

435
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,167
We must not fall into his hands

436
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:13,672
The so-called spy

437
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,042
Trapped in darkness and fighting endlessly

438
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:19,711
Years of fighting against the enemy

439
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:20,912
Countless casualties

440
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:23,181
Dead people

441
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:26,318
Can't even leave a name

442
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,278
We're going on a long journey tomorrow

443
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,580
Family in Beijing

444
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,282
Go say goodbye today

445
00:21:58,183 --> 00:21:59,318
Here we go

446
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:00,786
I don't know

447
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,287
When can I come back again?

448
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:24,309
Do you remember this place?

449
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:26,912
The old thief's residence

450
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:30,916
But look

451
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,084
It seems like a long time

452
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,318
No one has come back

453
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,187
No one knows where they are going

454
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:38,523
carefree

455
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:40,659
How nice

456
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:37,516
elder brother

457
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:41,987
I still cry when I grow up

458
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:45,190
Not afraid of being laughed at

459
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:48,460
Wait till I die

460
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,361
you won't die

461
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:51,029
you won't die

462
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:53,398
leave me here

463
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:55,500
You are Yuan Zhongxin

464
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,103
Who are you

465
00:23:58,403 --> 00:23:59,471
My name is Yuan Bo Fin

466
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:00,505
I am your big brother

467
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:03,909
Come home with me

468
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:06,445
People from the Yuan family have nothing to do with me

469
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:09,514
Now there is

470
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:13,285
I'll protect you from now on

471
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,986
With me you have a home

472
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:17,189
elder brother

473
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:27,699
Yuan Family Rebellion

474
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:31,803
The relics can only be hidden here

475
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:35,507
My brother was wronged

476
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:41,847
this world

477
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:43,081
will forget his name

478
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,518
you will remember him

479
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:49,688
I am also a guilty person

480
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:56,761
in this world

481
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:57,729
Except you and my brother

482
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:04,269
I have no one to say goodbye to

483
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,570
I now

484
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:08,306
There is no one left to say goodbye to.

485
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:09,541
Then we can't

486
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:10,709
Are you a miserable mandarin duck?

487
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,117
Not bitter

488
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:23,288
I never thought about it before

489
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,224
I'll be caught

490
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:31,029
Regret

491
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:32,898
Can I tell you if I regret it?

492
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:34,699
It's too late to regret

493
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,001
It's too late, it's too late

494
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:41,273
Yuan Zhongxin

495
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:44,609
I actually thought

496
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:46,511
Will you escape secretly?

497
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:48,079
Where to escape

498
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:49,848
leave us behind

499
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:51,783
Go south alone with Yuchiyuan

500
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:57,222
Me in the past

501
00:25:58,523 --> 00:25:59,524
No matter how big the incident is

502
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:00,992
I always want to carry it alone

503
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,562
If you don't ask for help, you won't owe anyone anything.

504
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:05,897
Always thinking about this life

505
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:06,998
No debt or debt

506
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:08,199
What now

507
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,368
Now I find that I actually

508
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:14,272
Quite afraid of being alone

509
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:20,045
In fact, I have always been afraid

510
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,847
Don’t be afraid anymore

511
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:37,529
No delay or arrears

512
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:40,065
How to face the human world?

513
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:06,825
Her father

514
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,827
Come and help me twist it

515
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:35,687
Father Adult

516
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:37,722
I came to say goodbye

517
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:51,469
This time I went

518
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:53,338
I don’t know when I can come back

519
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:55,473
Take care of yourself

520
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:58,076
Wang family’s generation

521
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,645
I originally regarded you as

522
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:01,913
Family hope

523
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,049
If you leave

524
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,118
From now on, the future has been cut off.

525
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,523
Father, forgive me

526
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:13,458
Do you want to be loyal to the Song Dynasty?

527
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:16,928
Have you ever thought about that?

528
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:19,698
in a high position

529
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,366
Only then can we try our best

530
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,235
There is always someone in a high position

531
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:26,037
There is no shortage of Wang Kuan

532
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:29,908
If one day

533
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,342
You've reached a dead end

534
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,278
Discover yourself

535
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:35,947
All it did was a joke

536
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,250
You can't save anything

537
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:41,286
Nothing can be done

538
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,989
You will regret your choice today

539
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:49,761
If you reach a dead end

540
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:52,030
I can only grit my teeth and move forward

541
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,199
There is no time to regret

542
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:40,311
this way please

543
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:45,350
Dean

544
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:52,924
How did you come

545
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:54,559
I'm leaving tomorrow.

546
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:56,394
I have to say goodbye to my family today

547
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,596
Then why did you come to me?

548
00:29:59,030 --> 00:29:59,964
in the capital city

549
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:01,599
I have no family anymore

550
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,035
What does it have to do with me

551
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:05,770
I'm just thinking

552
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:07,238
Should do something serious

553
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:08,740
What's serious

554
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:10,074
Xiaolu Zhangyuan

555
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,110
Going south this time

556
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:13,878
The journey is not close.

557
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:14,579
I know

558
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:16,381
We plan to split into two groups

559
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:18,550
Zhai Chang Yuan Zhongxin and Xue Ying

560
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:19,918
Along with Yu Chiyuan

561
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,553
I am Wang Kuan Xiaojing

562
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,987
The oriole is behind

563
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:23,755
Xiaolu Zhangyuan

564
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:25,223
Do you want to come with us?

565
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,257
Let's run together

566
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:27,225
All

567
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:29,527
Xiaolu Zhangyuan

568
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:30,829
you know too

569
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:33,832
This Yuan Zhongxin Xiaojing and Xue Ying

570
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:35,300
Basically a poor guy

571
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,068
My house was raided again.

572
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:38,903
Wang Kuan also had a falling out with his father

573
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,338
There is only one captain left

574
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:42,073
We still have to go with Yuchiyuan

575
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:44,442
What do you want to say

576
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,178
This time I went south to Tanzhou

577
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:49,480
Will I need to take a boat along the way?

578
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,883
Rent a carriage, eat and stay in a hotel

579
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:53,117
want money

580
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,586
We are also for

581
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,020
Mr. Xiao Lu, what are you doing?

582
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,688
right

583
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:09,868
Save some money

584
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:12,070
Xiaolu Zhangyuan

585
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,808
Jinghu South Road

586
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:18,543
More than three months

587
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:20,511
Really not enough

588
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,948
How much do you want?

589
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:29,020
How much property do you have in total?

590
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:31,489
Going south this time

591
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:32,724
But it's all for you

592
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:34,225
Is this true?

593
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:43,868
Here you go

594
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:48,006
This scabbard

595
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:49,007
sharkskin

596
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,909
There is a history

597
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,878
It is said to be a famous sword in the prosperous Tang Dynasty

598
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:55,546
Famous Swords of the Tang Dynasty

599
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:56,915
Your collection

600
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:58,182
Do you have a name?

601
00:31:58,182 --> 00:31:58,917
name

602
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:01,786
I really don’t know the name

603
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,121
It's a sword anyway

604
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:04,756
I've always been reluctant to use it

605
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,090
Always treasured

606
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:07,058
how

607
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,259
try

608
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,962
It is said that cutting iron is like clay.

609
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:23,741
This, this, this

610
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,044
I have treasured this for too long

611
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,714
It's okay, it's okay, Dad

612
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,349
Just apply some oil on it

613
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:32,917
The knife is still a good knife

614
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:41,426
One more and one more

615
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:47,465
Come

616
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:48,566
It seems to be rusty

617
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:10,555
Look at this

618
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,590
This knife is just like a human being

619
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,426
It's not like the older the better, right?

620
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,029
It's okay, it's okay, Dad

621
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,431
Doesn’t this also have a scabbard?

622
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:21,966
Shark skin is so valuable

623
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:22,834
I'll get there

624
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:23,801
Replaced mine

625
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:24,902
good

626
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:26,004
By the time

627
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:26,838
Dad

628
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:28,339
Clean the knife for you

629
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,341
son

630
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:32,810
Look, our shop is not open either.

631
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:34,579
or

632
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,914
Eat before leaving

633
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:38,182
good

634
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:42,320
Your mother is not at home either

635
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,022
Then just eat whatever you want

636
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:45,423
good

637
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:46,824
Drink the whole drink

638
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:47,859
I can do it all

639
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,763
My collection of fine wine

640
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:53,664
It is a treasure

641
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,667
Is this wine different from this knife?

642
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,802
I'll take it.

643
00:33:58,236 --> 00:33:58,903
I'll take it

644
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:04,308
What's wrong, dad?

645
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:09,280
son

646
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:10,915
This wine

647
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,418
I can't take them all out

648
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:16,554
I have to leave a jar

649
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,021
Keep it

650
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:18,523
I don't drink much either

651
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:20,825
This jar of wine

652
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,327
Can I drink it when you come back?

653
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:28,366
good

654
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:30,768
Keep your word

655
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:32,870
I'll take it. I'll take it.

656
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:40,144
Dead Ghost Uncle

657
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:41,679
You still need to reshape it?

658
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,781
I'm bored

659
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:46,517
Don't know what else to do

660
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:48,686
keep it

661
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:49,954
Keep it, keep it

662
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:51,589
There is emotion

663
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,627
You didn't find it

664
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:58,229
What you really want to do

665
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:08,873
Fame, wealth and power are all you want in the world

666
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,741
But that's it

667
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:13,778
boring

668
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:16,514
boring

669
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,983
You said goodbye to your family

670
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:23,788
I glanced at it from a distance

671
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:24,689
Didn't come in

672
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:27,258
they were

673
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:28,993
Exchanging letters with Han Han

674
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:30,394
If I leak it

675
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:31,796
News from the South to Tanzhou

676
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,631
It might hurt everyone

677
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,507
Think so carefully

678
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,750
Shouldn't we spend money along the way?

679
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:54,819
Where did the money come from?

680
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:00,124
Our Xiaolu Zhangyuan

681
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,425
Still have some family property

682
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:03,461
Save some money

683
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,596
Remember to come back if you don’t use it up

684
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,166
Don't worry

685
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,500
There are so many people

686
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,601
No more left

687
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,304
Dare to fall in love with so many people

688
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:14,705
I'm the only one spending money

689
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,641
You are the new president.

690
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:19,510
Where are Yuan Zhongxin and the others?

691
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,445
They went directly to the gate of Chenzhou

692
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:23,748
Then we are all here too

693
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:24,715
It's almost time to leave

694
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:25,716
Not urgent

695
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,752
There is one more person

696
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:28,953
Who else?

697
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:36,527
sister

698
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,447
Drinking

699
00:36:57,848 --> 00:36:59,250
Had two drinks with my dad

700
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:01,752
Drank too much

701
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:03,554
No

702
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:06,591
My father and mother drank too much

703
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,360
That's because I can't bear to leave you

704
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:11,662
I know

705
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:19,203
Xue Ying

706
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:20,638
actually

707
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:22,073
You don't have to go

708
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,674
Stay in Kaifeng and take care of your parents

709
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:24,842
It's also very important.

710
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:27,245
No

711
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,180
I have to protect you

712
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:31,682
We still need your protection

713
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:32,883
Can you beat me?

714
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:35,786
Sometimes people are not necessarily

715
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:37,488
It has to be solved by force

716
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:39,323
You have to rely on outsmarting, you know?

717
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:41,225
Then can you beat me?

718
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,393
Can't beat

719
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:43,628
But than you

720
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:44,996
There are so many people with strong military skills.

721
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:46,797
Not bad for you either

722
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:47,765
It's really not possible

723
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:48,899
We'll go back and pay for one.

724
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:50,968
That won't work.

725
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:52,870
except me

726
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:54,872
nobody

727
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,274
no one will

728
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,475
Risking my life to protect you

729
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:58,442
All right, all right

730
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,077
Stop talking about risking your life

731
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:00,678
ok

732
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,315
If I stay

733
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:07,551
I will never feel at ease in my life

734
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:08,786
Why are you so stubborn?

735
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:12,890
I definitely won't stay

736
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:13,224
OK

737
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:14,792
Go together

738
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,395
But don’t risk anyone’s life

739
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,363
We have to come back together

740
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:21,666
good

741
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:23,301
alright

742
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:24,402
Let's go

743
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:25,870
Walk

744
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:28,139
Where is Yuchiyuan?

745
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:30,908
What are you doing

746
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:34,912
Traveling far away

747
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:36,981
Pay homage to all the gods and lords

748
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:38,182
Bless peace

749
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:39,684
Quite particular

750
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,320
Sincerity leads to spirituality

751
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:43,421
Sincere

752
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:44,355
spirit

753
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:49,460
Let's go

754
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:51,395
Wait a moment

755
00:38:57,868 --> 00:38:58,602
What are you doing

756
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,071
Traveling far away

757
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:01,706
Say hello to Lord Ma

758
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:02,540
Bless peace

759
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:06,677
this is a horse

760
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,179
The horse is not the King of Horses

761
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,118
Lord Ma, I'm sorry

762
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:15,019
Young people are ignorant

763
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:15,886
Don't blame

764
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,432
Okay, stop trying to persuade me.

765
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:30,368
This kind of person believes everything

766
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,435
I just won't believe you

767
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:40,044
Why are you following Xiao Lu, the headmaster?

768
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,383
Xiaolu Zhangyuan was commissioned by the Privy Council

769
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,484
bright future

770
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:49,086
It's very dangerous, you know?

771
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:51,589
Seeking wealth through risk

772
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,758
How can you ask for this?

773
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,061
Don't ask him

774
00:39:57,194 --> 00:39:58,062
Not a word of truth

775
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:00,498
Sit down first

776
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:09,240
Why haven't they set off yet?

777
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,942
Why is Yuchiyuan still kneeling down?

778
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:24,488
baffling

779
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:29,193
Dead Ghost Uncle

780
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,828
You should take this with you too

781
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:31,762
No?

782
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:36,233
let me guess

783
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:38,602
Is this

784
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:39,170
What is your name?

785
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,638
particularly important friend

786
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,806
died suddenly

787
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:42,440
Then take this chicken

788
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,040
Entrusted to you

789
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,009
Your friend is dead and entrusted with this

790
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:49,146
Then it's been a bumpy road

791
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,347
It can't bear it

792
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,450
It's tougher than you.

793
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:02,793
They moved

794
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:03,761
Follow us

795
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:06,197
Let's go

796
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:14,138
Look at what I'm doing

797
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:16,040
You can't hear it from so far away

798
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,342
Be careful

799
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,148
It's not louder than me

800
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:30,988
Give it a moment, give it a moment

801
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:49,066
This mountain spring water

802
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,501
It's sweet

803
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,715
did you hear

804
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:06,584
hear something

805
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:07,818
The cock crows

806
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:09,153
What's wrong with the cock crow?

807
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:10,955
That's not the case

808
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:12,590
But do you feel

809
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,624
Along the way

810
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:15,125
Hear it every day

811
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,961
What's wrong

812
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:17,995
My people of Song Dynasty

813
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:18,963
Can’t you raise chickens?

814
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:20,197
That's not what I meant.

815
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:22,032
What do I want to say?

816
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,500
it's getting dark

817
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,001
Before Dark

818
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:25,169
Can we go to Tanzhou?

819
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,438
No need to go to Tanzhou

820
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,139
There is a posthouse in the woods ahead

821
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,040
Just get there

822
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:30,941
Wrong?

823
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:33,277
Our post house in the Song Dynasty

824
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,645
Always built on the official road

825
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:36,313
How could we be in the depths of this dense forest?

826
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,149
Abandoned post house in the early years

827
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:40,718
Now occupied by Mr. Yuan

828
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:42,152
If nothing unexpected happens

829
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:43,520
You can see Mr. Yuan in the post office

830
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:45,222
Generally speaking, it’s surprising

831
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:47,524
Stop talking nonsense

832
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:49,593
I came here to pay my respects

833
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:51,161
All gods and Buddhas will bless you

834
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:52,930
Do you believe in gods and Buddhas?

835
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:56,767
Is there anyone who doesn’t believe it?

836
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:58,702
have you seen

837
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:02,473
All these gods and Buddhas are in heaven

838
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,540
How can a mortal see it?

839
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,441
Then you haven't seen it

840
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:05,643
How do you know it's true?

841
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,044
How could it be if it wasn't?

842
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:07,911
So many people believe it

843
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:12,316
Logic genius

844
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,190
Hurry, go faster

845
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:25,963
Which way to go next?

846
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:28,899
The post house is this way

847
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,041
what sound
