01:49.070 --> 01:49.790
Young Master

01:51.350 --> 01:52.070
Young Master

01:52.230 --> 01:53.120
Taozi Chen Xing

01:53.640 --> 01:54.510
It’s been a hard journey

01:55.000 --> 01:56.070
How is your father's health?

01:56.430 --> 01:57.280
Report back to the young master

01:57.430 --> 01:59.000
Lord Shang was originally suffering from wind-cold disorder.

01:59.150 --> 02:00.280
When attacking Hanzhou

02:00.400 --> 02:01.430
Opened old wounds again

02:01.680 --> 02:02.230
so

02:02.230 --> 02:03.280
Recuperated for a while

02:03.480 --> 02:04.710
But it's no big deal now

02:04.840 --> 02:05.870
Don't worry, sir.

02:06.640 --> 02:08.430
My lord, I miss you and the captain very much.

02:08.560 --> 02:09.240
speak

02:09.310 --> 02:10.590
The young master has old wounds on his body

02:10.750 --> 02:12.470
There is no one around the captain to take care of him

02:12.630 --> 02:14.150
So I sent Chen Xing and me immediately

02:14.280 --> 02:14.870
Return to the army

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
The captain is missing

02:16.680 --> 02:17.430
What

02:18.630 --> 02:19.750
But fortunately

02:20.000 --> 02:21.280
You are back safely now

02:21.560 --> 02:22.710
I'm afraid this world

02:23.030 --> 02:23.630
Only you have a way

02:23.800 --> 02:24.870
Can find her

02:25.680 --> 02:26.750
Don't worry, sir.

02:27.080 --> 02:27.590
Only the captain

02:27.710 --> 02:29.030
Still using that powder

02:29.190 --> 02:30.520
I will definitely find her

02:35.310 --> 02:35.870
explain

02:36.280 --> 02:37.840
You two are sneaky

02:38.080 --> 02:39.080
What are you doing here on our mountain?

02:39.360 --> 02:39.910
Big brother

02:40.240 --> 02:41.120
I see these two people

02:41.240 --> 02:42.560
Wearing leather boots

02:42.680 --> 02:43.840
They must be two fat sheep

02:44.190 --> 02:45.590
This girl disguised as a man

02:45.710 --> 02:46.150
good looking

02:46.280 --> 02:46.840
Big brother

02:47.080 --> 02:48.360
You don’t have Mrs. Yazhai yet

02:48.630 --> 02:51.400
It's better to marry and be a wife

02:52.240 --> 02:53.560
Married as a wife

02:53.800 --> 02:54.590
Married to be a lady

02:54.590 --> 02:55.280
exchange money

02:55.430 --> 02:55.870
married

02:55.960 --> 02:56.840
exchange money

02:56.910 --> 02:57.280
married

02:57.280 --> 02:57.840
exchange money

02:57.960 --> 02:58.520
married

02:58.590 --> 02:59.360
Shut up

03:00.280 --> 03:01.310
who is the boss

03:01.470 --> 03:02.150
Big brother

03:06.000 --> 03:06.520
you

03:07.280 --> 03:08.360
tell me honestly

03:08.750 --> 03:09.800
who are you

03:11.190 --> 03:12.520
Let me tell you the truth

03:13.840 --> 03:15.190
actually i am

03:16.080 --> 03:18.190
The concubine of the emperor's grandson Li Ni

03:19.190 --> 03:21.190
My husband-in-law is not only the grandson of the emperor

03:21.470 --> 03:22.430
Still famous

03:22.560 --> 03:23.870
Counterinsurgency Marshal

03:24.120 --> 03:25.430
young

03:25.710 --> 03:27.240
Then he led the various prefectures in the west of Zhenxi

03:27.560 --> 03:28.910
Command an army of 100,000

03:30.840 --> 03:31.750
This is one hundred thousand

03:31.870 --> 03:32.750
real or fake

03:33.560 --> 03:34.470
My husband at this moment

03:34.560 --> 03:35.960
Inside Wangzhou City

03:36.960 --> 03:38.310
As long as you let me go

03:39.430 --> 03:41.520
I will definitely give you a lot of money

03:43.120 --> 03:44.430
Nonsense

03:45.190 --> 03:45.800
you

03:46.240 --> 03:47.030
you say

03:47.190 --> 03:48.430
Who is she?

03:49.280 --> 03:50.680
she is

03:53.120 --> 03:55.310
The concubine of the emperor's grandson Li Ni

03:55.630 --> 03:57.240
Then I will naturally be her guardian

03:57.870 --> 03:59.630
I'm on the order of the emperor's grandson

03:59.840 --> 04:01.360
Protect her to Wangzhou

04:03.960 --> 04:04.840
This emperor’s family

04:04.910 --> 04:06.080
Weren't they all killed?

04:06.400 --> 04:06.910
you are here

04:07.000 --> 04:08.080
Open your mouth and talk nonsense

04:08.240 --> 04:09.400
What are you talking about, the grandson of the emperor?

04:09.710 --> 04:11.190
Do you think we are easy to deceive?

04:11.280 --> 04:11.800
that is

04:11.960 --> 04:13.560
Lie to us, lie to us

04:13.680 --> 04:14.840
Want to lie to us

04:14.960 --> 04:15.590
Big brother

04:16.160 --> 04:18.070
This girl kept saying

04:18.190 --> 04:20.040
Her husband-in-law is Marshal of Zhenxi

04:20.240 --> 04:21.040
Our second brother Zhao

04:21.120 --> 04:22.750
Wasn't he once in the Zhenxi Army?

04:23.000 --> 04:23.190
Not as good as

04:23.270 --> 04:24.000
Let's invite Brother Zhao out

04:24.070 --> 04:24.800
Distinguish between true and false

04:25.120 --> 04:26.040
Go and invite the second brother to come

04:39.950 --> 04:41.430
Where did this little thief come from?

04:41.720 --> 04:43.600
Dare to pretend to be a member of our Zhenxi Army?

04:43.750 --> 04:45.070
Second brother

04:53.430 --> 04:53.950
Second brother, this

04:54.360 --> 04:55.430
Jushichiro

04:56.390 --> 04:57.510
It's really you, brother

04:59.270 --> 05:00.480
Untie it quickly

05:00.600 --> 05:01.560
Untie it quickly, quickly

05:01.630 --> 05:02.270
untie untie

05:03.070 --> 05:05.630
He turned out to be Li Ni, the seventeenth grandson of the emperor

05:05.630 --> 05:07.240
Are you okay? I'll do it.

05:08.000 --> 05:08.920
Slow down, slow down, slow down

05:09.240 --> 05:11.120
Tie this woman up tight

05:12.600 --> 05:13.920
Hurry up, tie it up tighter

05:14.000 --> 05:14.720
Tighter, tighter

05:14.800 --> 05:16.040
Don't let her run too hard

05:19.190 --> 05:20.270
This is my town's Western Army

05:20.510 --> 05:21.190
A member of the scout team back then

05:21.310 --> 05:22.000
brother

05:22.480 --> 05:23.800
Let’s go deep into Moxi together

05:23.920 --> 05:25.390
To spy on the military situation of the Tattoo Army

05:26.000 --> 05:27.070
Twelve people in total

05:27.160 --> 05:28.480
Before touching the king's tent

05:29.070 --> 05:30.190
last alive

05:30.720 --> 05:31.870
Just me and him

05:35.190 --> 05:36.680
I lost an arm

05:37.750 --> 05:38.800
It's Shishiro

05:39.000 --> 05:40.510
Carry me across the entire desert

05:40.630 --> 05:41.600
Back to camp

05:48.560 --> 05:49.920
Second brother, this second brother

05:50.040 --> 05:51.240
He is my savior

05:54.040 --> 05:54.680
benefactor

05:55.160 --> 05:57.190
benefactor benefactor benefactor

05:59.160 --> 05:59.480
Come

06:01.160 --> 06:01.870
All brothers

06:02.270 --> 06:03.720
Don't say such nonsense

06:05.920 --> 06:07.360
brother

06:08.830 --> 06:09.510
Come, come, come

06:09.600 --> 06:10.510
Go ahead

06:11.270 --> 06:12.560
dry dry dry

06:12.920 --> 06:13.680
happy

06:16.600 --> 06:17.390
Jushichiro

06:18.040 --> 06:19.600
You used to always brag to me

06:19.680 --> 06:21.510
He said your father is a landlord in Jiangbei

06:21.630 --> 06:23.480
The family has sixteen acres of fertile land

06:23.800 --> 06:25.310
And four top-quality oxen

06:26.430 --> 06:28.120
He said his father was a landlord in Jiangbei

06:28.240 --> 06:29.360
Do you really believe it?

06:29.480 --> 06:30.360
Of course I don’t believe it

06:30.830 --> 06:32.560
If he is the son of a landlord

06:33.120 --> 06:35.510
I am the emperor and his second uncle

06:36.870 --> 06:37.560
Second uncle

06:39.430 --> 06:41.160
You are really senior

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
You girl

06:43.120 --> 06:44.160
Don't be chirpy

06:44.560 --> 06:45.310
Talk again

06:45.390 --> 06:46.720
I'll shut your mouth

06:48.310 --> 06:48.920
brother

06:49.510 --> 06:50.510
What else did you say

06:51.830 --> 06:53.310
You said you won't be a soldier when you wait

06:53.680 --> 06:55.160
I have to go home and be a farm servant.

06:55.270 --> 06:56.680
Collect rent from people every day

06:57.680 --> 06:58.390
did not expect

06:58.560 --> 07:00.070
We can still meet here

07:00.630 --> 07:01.430
Jushichiro

07:02.040 --> 07:02.950
I, Huang Youyi

07:03.120 --> 07:04.070
The most respected in my life

07:04.160 --> 07:05.600
A kindhearted hero

07:05.950 --> 07:07.600
I heard what my second brother said today

07:07.800 --> 07:08.870
I just realized you were guarding the border

07:08.950 --> 07:10.430
The Zhenxi Army that fought against the Tattoo Army

07:10.720 --> 07:12.390
Saved my second brother’s life again

07:12.560 --> 07:14.680
It makes us want to join the Zhenxi Army even more

07:14.950 --> 07:15.510
today

07:15.870 --> 07:17.000
I can't wait

07:17.680 --> 07:18.390
here

07:19.000 --> 07:20.160
Make amends first

07:24.390 --> 07:25.000
Get up quickly

07:28.510 --> 07:29.600
Let the brothers also get up

07:30.430 --> 07:31.360
Get up, everyone

07:31.560 --> 07:32.120
Get up, everyone

07:34.040 --> 07:34.680
this time

07:35.000 --> 07:35.870
It's a misunderstanding

07:36.430 --> 07:37.510
I'd like to toast all brothers

07:37.950 --> 07:38.240
Come

07:38.600 --> 07:39.000
Dry

07:39.120 --> 07:39.560
Dry

07:45.240 --> 07:45.750
general

07:46.040 --> 07:46.630
This is the Cui family army

07:46.750 --> 07:47.800
He Xiaowei's horse

07:48.040 --> 07:49.270
Since the horse is here

07:49.600 --> 07:51.000
People must not have run far yet

07:51.310 --> 07:52.360
This mountain is densely forested

07:52.560 --> 07:53.920
Our army spent another tiring night

07:54.190 --> 07:55.360
I'm afraid it will be difficult to catch up

07:55.800 --> 07:56.310
general

07:56.510 --> 07:56.950
why us

07:57.070 --> 07:58.510
Not directly retaking Wangzhou City

07:59.000 --> 08:00.560
The army in Zhenxi is strong and strong

08:00.800 --> 08:02.270
Cui Jiajun is watching with eager eyes

08:02.390 --> 08:03.950
The enemy is strong and we are weak, so we cannot attack forcefully.

08:04.430 --> 08:05.830
The only way is to capture General Pei first.

08:05.950 --> 08:06.390
He Xiaowei

08:06.510 --> 08:07.630
These two important people

08:07.750 --> 08:09.360
Only then can we exchange for the city.

08:10.070 --> 08:11.430
At this time we are exhausted

08:11.830 --> 08:13.070
The camp was burned down again

08:13.270 --> 08:14.430
He also hurt many brothers

08:14.870 --> 08:15.830
Keep it like this

08:16.040 --> 08:17.630
Those two important people didn't catch up

08:17.870 --> 08:18.560
Everyone

08:18.680 --> 08:20.240
But I'm trapped in this mountain

08:20.680 --> 08:21.310
nearby

08:21.600 --> 08:22.120
Is there any place

08:22.240 --> 08:23.070
You can rest

08:23.190 --> 08:24.070
This Mingdai Mountain area

08:24.190 --> 08:25.040
There is a group of bandits

08:25.240 --> 08:26.070
Self-built cottage

08:26.240 --> 08:27.120
Be the king of the mountain

08:27.310 --> 08:28.600
I don’t usually disturb people.

08:28.720 --> 08:29.240
so

08:29.390 --> 08:30.430
Our Wangzhou garrison

08:30.560 --> 08:31.800
That's why we didn't wipe them out.

08:32.440 --> 08:32.870
Send an order

08:33.440 --> 08:34.550
Capture the mountain stronghold first

08:35.080 --> 08:36.240
Our army camp was burned

08:36.360 --> 08:37.670
There's no place to stay anymore

08:38.000 --> 08:39.870
Recuperate first, occupy the mountain and become king

08:40.000 --> 08:40.630
Waiting for Governor Sun

08:40.790 --> 08:41.720
Reinforcements are coming

08:41.870 --> 08:42.440
yes

08:54.270 --> 08:55.080
Jushichiro

08:55.440 --> 08:57.200
where did you come from this time

08:57.320 --> 08:58.320
Where are you going?

08:58.550 --> 08:59.320
Brother Zhao

08:59.440 --> 09:00.720
Seventeen Lang this time

09:00.840 --> 09:02.630
She is the concubine who is escorting the emperor's grandson

09:02.790 --> 09:04.030
Going to Wangzhou

09:05.960 --> 09:06.670
I'm just talking about the emperor's grandson

09:06.790 --> 09:07.840
Not a thing

09:08.390 --> 09:09.120
The enemy is now

09:09.240 --> 09:10.390
He still thinks about women

09:12.790 --> 09:13.550
after i got hurt

09:13.790 --> 09:14.840
The imperial court originally said

09:14.960 --> 09:16.510
Give me twenty acres of farmland

09:17.360 --> 09:18.270
I total it up

09:18.510 --> 09:20.150
Growing food at home is also a way to survive.

09:20.630 --> 09:21.150
But I didn't expect

09:21.240 --> 09:22.670
The imperial court actually tricked people

09:23.240 --> 09:24.080
They took the fields

09:24.320 --> 09:26.150
Gave it to the emperor's son as an imperial palace

09:26.840 --> 09:27.670
my old mother

09:27.910 --> 09:29.750
This is how he was starved to death

09:30.480 --> 09:31.600
I'm so angry

09:32.600 --> 09:34.000
So he defected to Mingdai Village

09:38.030 --> 09:38.960
There is such a thing

09:40.750 --> 09:41.960
After Sun Jing's rebellion

09:42.120 --> 09:44.150
Many villages were trampled by the army

09:44.550 --> 09:45.840
I don’t even know now

09:46.240 --> 09:46.870
our village

09:47.000 --> 09:48.270
Is there anyone alive?

09:48.510 --> 09:49.910
Seventeen Lang, you don’t know

09:50.320 --> 09:51.390
I originally

09:51.670 --> 09:54.080
I am a fortune teller in the village.

09:54.240 --> 09:54.720
I can do it

09:54.840 --> 09:55.960
You have to support your family, right?

09:56.630 --> 09:57.630
This court

09:57.790 --> 09:59.240
It was forced to do corvée work several times

09:59.390 --> 10:00.960
Several corvee expeditions

10:01.080 --> 10:02.790
I really can't live anymore

10:02.790 --> 10:03.120
I

10:03.240 --> 10:05.240
I just fell into the trap of others.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.360
Our brothers here

10:09.150 --> 10:10.840
Everyone has a bitter taste

10:11.360 --> 10:13.030
No matter who is surnamed Li, he will dominate the world

10:13.150 --> 10:15.000
Still the old thief named Sun

10:15.390 --> 10:16.750
They don't even give us a way to survive.

10:17.320 --> 10:18.030
We

10:18.870 --> 10:20.790
I had no choice but to go up the mountain and become a robber.

10:22.440 --> 10:23.360
Jushichiro

10:23.630 --> 10:24.750
Since you are here, you are here

10:24.910 --> 10:25.840
Why don't you just be the big brother?

10:25.960 --> 10:26.910
Take us

10:27.080 --> 10:28.120
Let's go to Zhenxi Army together

10:28.200 --> 10:29.000
OK

10:29.120 --> 10:30.200
Right, brother?

10:31.030 --> 10:31.480
right

10:32.200 --> 10:34.270
We regard you as our big brother

10:35.510 --> 10:36.960
Big brother big brother big brother

10:37.030 --> 10:37.630
no no no

10:37.790 --> 10:38.510
No need to be humble

10:38.670 --> 10:40.120
Today is a good day

10:40.390 --> 10:41.670
We just happened to burn incense and become sworn brothers

10:41.790 --> 10:43.080
OK OK

10:43.200 --> 10:45.270
Just kill this girl and sacrifice her to heaven.

10:45.790 --> 10:46.670
Can't kill, can't kill

10:47.790 --> 10:48.360
Can't kill

10:49.080 --> 10:51.240
Brother, why is this?

10:52.630 --> 10:53.360
who knows

10:53.600 --> 10:54.510
do you know

10:54.630 --> 10:55.790
I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know

10:56.000 --> 10:56.870
because

10:56.870 --> 10:57.270
Who knows?

10:57.480 --> 10:58.120
That's right

10:59.320 --> 10:59.910
do you know

11:00.840 --> 11:02.080
because she is

11:02.630 --> 11:03.960
The concubine of the emperor's grandson

11:05.240 --> 11:05.750
but

11:06.910 --> 11:07.790
She is my sweetheart

11:09.390 --> 11:10.480
We are both in love

11:10.480 --> 11:11.240
It's my sister-in-law

11:11.360 --> 11:12.670
It took a lot of effort to find the opportunity

11:13.200 --> 11:14.440
Make an appointment to elope

11:17.670 --> 11:19.440
Brother, why didn't you tell me earlier?

11:20.390 --> 11:21.750
This sister-in-law is still tied up.

11:21.910 --> 11:23.000
How cold it is on the ground

11:23.120 --> 11:24.120
Sister-in-law, Sister-in-law, Sister-in-law

11:24.200 --> 11:25.390
Sister-in-law, let me untie you

11:25.510 --> 11:27.030
Aren't I embarrassed?

11:27.390 --> 11:28.360
I'm so sorry

11:28.550 --> 11:29.840
Sister-in-law is so offended

11:30.200 --> 11:33.200
Laolan River Eighteen Bays

11:33.360 --> 11:37.120
The first bay is Silver Pine Beach

11:37.270 --> 11:41.240
Fish fat in Yinsongtan

12:07.320 --> 12:08.150
What's this

12:08.630 --> 12:09.360
Big brother

12:09.750 --> 12:10.910
We are humble in the mountains

12:11.150 --> 12:12.030
I can't do it for you and my sister-in-law

12:12.150 --> 12:13.030
Get married

12:13.440 --> 12:14.720
But this bridal chamber

12:14.840 --> 12:15.840
But it’s indispensable

12:16.030 --> 12:17.320
Entering the bridal chamber

12:17.440 --> 12:18.870
Brother, don't be embarrassed

12:18.960 --> 12:19.440
Come, come, come

12:19.550 --> 12:20.670
Come in quickly. Come in quickly.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.000
Come on, sister-in-law

12:22.320 --> 12:23.200
Come and go, come and go

12:23.360 --> 12:24.150
Let's go, let's go

12:24.240 --> 12:24.440
go ahead

12:24.550 --> 12:25.750
Brother, hurry up

12:26.150 --> 12:27.550
Brothers, good times are short

12:27.670 --> 12:28.360
Let's go first

12:28.630 --> 12:29.080
Go, go, go

12:29.200 --> 12:29.600
Go, go, go

12:30.960 --> 12:31.960
gone

12:34.240 --> 12:36.480
General Pei of the Zhenxi Army

12:36.960 --> 12:39.120
The concubine of the emperor's grandson Li Ni

12:41.550 --> 12:42.960
Jushichiro Jushichiro

12:43.550 --> 12:44.510
Jushichiro

12:45.630 --> 12:47.080
The brothers found it with great difficulty

12:47.200 --> 12:47.790
Flowers and candles in your bridal chamber

12:47.910 --> 12:48.960
How could we not have this?

12:49.150 --> 12:49.840
hold

12:50.030 --> 12:51.030
Don't keep my sister-in-law waiting.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.550
Thank you very much

12:52.960 --> 12:54.150
I'm leaving soon

12:55.670 --> 12:56.840
This town is in the Western Army

12:57.000 --> 12:58.360
The famous Seventeenth Lang

12:58.480 --> 13:00.200
That’s the emperor’s grandson Li Yi

13:01.440 --> 13:03.240
These bandits don't know

13:05.510 --> 13:06.720
But do I know

13:07.790 --> 13:08.510
Strange

13:08.630 --> 13:09.270
That Zhao Youde

13:09.440 --> 13:10.320
I was also in Zhenxi Army before

13:10.440 --> 13:11.960
why doesn't he know

13:14.360 --> 13:15.550
It turns out that some people

13:15.630 --> 13:16.840
I was in the military before

13:16.960 --> 13:18.240
incognito

13:18.390 --> 13:19.960
But later the military merits accumulated to

13:20.080 --> 13:21.600
When you want to be sealed for three generations

13:21.750 --> 13:23.510
I can no longer hide it

13:23.750 --> 13:24.790
But at that time

13:24.960 --> 13:25.360
Zhao Youde

13:25.510 --> 13:26.960
Already left the Zhenxi Army

13:27.080 --> 13:28.320
Am I right?

13:29.630 --> 13:30.440
so what

13:30.960 --> 13:32.200
You didn't expose me just now

13:32.390 --> 13:32.910
how

13:33.240 --> 13:34.750
Do you want to expose me now?

13:36.000 --> 13:37.200
I didn’t expect you would actually use it as a pretense

13:37.360 --> 13:39.030
General Pei's name

13:39.480 --> 13:41.030
Even I was almost deceived by you

13:43.910 --> 13:45.080
If not so

13:45.510 --> 13:46.630
How can I hear it with my own ears?

13:46.790 --> 13:48.030
some people say

13:48.150 --> 13:50.440
She is the concubine of the emperor's grandson Li Ni

13:52.390 --> 13:53.630
villain

14:00.270 --> 14:00.910
stand up

14:01.270 --> 14:02.870
I sleep on the bed and you sleep on the floor

14:03.480 --> 14:04.550
I've been struggling all day

14:04.720 --> 14:05.600
I need to take a good rest

14:05.750 --> 14:06.150
I can handle it

14:06.320 --> 14:07.030
You're so scheming

14:07.200 --> 14:08.750
A little liar who tells lies

14:08.960 --> 14:09.200
hurry up

14:10.150 --> 14:11.150
you are a gentleman

14:11.270 --> 14:12.320
You sleep on the floor

14:25.550 --> 14:26.480
what you do

14:27.440 --> 14:28.510
What to do

14:31.200 --> 14:32.720
Since you are my concubine

14:33.150 --> 14:33.390
Then we

14:33.550 --> 14:34.960
sleeping on a bed

14:35.270 --> 14:36.360
That's okay

14:39.080 --> 14:40.120
lecher

14:44.240 --> 14:45.150
You've already scolded me like this

14:45.390 --> 14:46.000
Then I definitely can't

14:46.150 --> 14:47.480
This false name is in vain

15:16.200 --> 15:17.480
My own peach

15:17.960 --> 15:18.790
school lieutenant

15:20.200 --> 15:21.150
Lieutenant, are you okay?

15:21.550 --> 15:21.960
fine

15:22.600 --> 15:23.630
This person is so rude

15:23.910 --> 15:25.240
I'll shoot him to death with one arrow to vent your anger.

15:25.840 --> 15:26.480
OK

15:26.790 --> 15:27.630
Your captain

15:27.630 --> 15:28.390
I've wanted to do this for a long time

15:28.910 --> 15:29.960
But until now she

15:29.960 --> 15:30.510
None of them succeeded

15:30.670 --> 15:31.630
Do you want to try it?

15:32.840 --> 15:33.240
you

15:33.840 --> 15:34.480
stop

15:38.510 --> 15:39.510
It's time for me to say this

15:40.030 --> 15:40.790
own people

15:43.360 --> 15:44.750
problem occurs

15:44.910 --> 15:46.320
Someone's calling

15:46.600 --> 15:47.720
big brother big brother

15:47.790 --> 15:48.600
big brother big brother

15:49.030 --> 15:49.960
big brother big brother

15:50.390 --> 15:50.750
Big brother

15:50.910 --> 15:51.390
What's wrong

15:51.750 --> 15:52.240
Big brother

15:52.360 --> 15:53.910
There is a brother outside bringing a message in

15:54.000 --> 15:54.720
Said there was a large team of people

15:54.840 --> 15:55.960
Come to the mountain immediately to fight

15:56.120 --> 15:57.120
What do you call yourself?

15:57.240 --> 15:58.600
To rebel against the governor's banner

15:58.720 --> 16:00.240
The army led by General Guo Zhi

16:00.360 --> 16:01.480
Said he wanted to take away our cottage

16:01.630 --> 16:02.550
kill us all

16:02.670 --> 16:03.750
Are we going to be sacrificed to heaven?

16:03.870 --> 16:05.000
listen to them fart

16:05.120 --> 16:06.000
It's okay, brother

16:06.200 --> 16:07.550
Our cottage is condescending

16:07.720 --> 16:08.510
Easy to defend but difficult to attack

16:08.720 --> 16:10.000
Brothers rely on the terrain

16:10.150 --> 16:11.630
You can also kill them without leaving a single piece of armor behind.

16:11.790 --> 16:12.480
Yeah

16:12.600 --> 16:13.200
Leave no trace behind

16:13.360 --> 16:14.390
Leave no trace behind

16:14.600 --> 16:17.150
Kill kill kill

16:17.270 --> 16:18.150
Don't lie

16:19.550 --> 16:19.910
Second child

16:20.030 --> 16:20.550
Second brother

16:20.840 --> 16:21.670
The one named Guo

16:21.840 --> 16:22.870
He's an old acquaintance of ours.

16:23.390 --> 16:24.000
Just before

16:24.150 --> 16:25.840
General Guo, who has been stationed in Wangzhou

16:26.790 --> 16:27.870
It turned out to be him

16:28.000 --> 16:28.550
did not expect

16:28.670 --> 16:29.960
He actually took refuge in Sun Jing

16:30.550 --> 16:31.790
That's really hard to do

16:32.750 --> 16:33.720
The one named Guo

16:33.840 --> 16:34.870
Birthplace: Inishi

16:35.120 --> 16:36.390
But when it comes to the world’s military

16:36.550 --> 16:37.480
Let’s hold down the Western Army

16:37.630 --> 16:39.030
Why are you afraid of other provinces?

16:39.510 --> 16:40.360
Yes, yes

16:40.510 --> 16:41.150
Yes, yes

16:41.270 --> 16:41.790
This is from my Zhenxi Army

16:41.910 --> 16:42.790
scout brothers

16:43.030 --> 16:44.360
He followed Guo Zhi all the way tonight

16:44.510 --> 16:45.440
He also came to report to me

16:46.240 --> 16:47.440
There are still many people in Guo Zhi's remnant army

16:47.600 --> 16:48.870
And they are skilled with bows and arrows

16:49.030 --> 16:49.750
head-on

16:49.910 --> 16:51.200
We will definitely suffer

16:51.960 --> 16:52.720
That Seventeenth Lang

16:52.870 --> 16:54.080
Take this lady with you quickly

16:54.120 --> 16:55.150
Let's go together

16:56.150 --> 16:56.720
school lieutenant

16:56.960 --> 16:57.790
You go back to the camp first

16:57.840 --> 16:59.000
The young master is waiting for you in Bingzhou

17:02.360 --> 17:03.960
To Shichiro, you should leave first.

17:04.110 --> 17:04.790
I'm here

17:07.550 --> 17:08.030
Too

17:08.590 --> 17:10.310
My brother who is a scout

17:10.480 --> 17:12.240
He is best at fighting in dense forests

17:12.400 --> 17:13.160
He will win

17:13.310 --> 17:14.790
Those remnant soldiers of Guo Zhi

17:16.440 --> 17:17.640
I'll stay and help too

17:19.480 --> 17:21.790
This female envoy of mine is very good at war.

17:21.920 --> 17:22.960
keep her

17:23.070 --> 17:24.750
I will definitely be able to help everyone

17:24.920 --> 17:26.350
Great. Thank you. Thank you.

17:26.480 --> 17:26.790
yes

17:27.480 --> 17:27.920
thank you

17:28.350 --> 17:29.240
thank you all

17:29.400 --> 17:29.750
thank you thank you

17:29.920 --> 17:30.790
thank you

17:43.030 --> 17:44.240
I really can't walk anymore

17:44.720 --> 17:45.270
You'd better hurry up

17:45.400 --> 17:46.720
Go back to your Wangzhou City

17:47.160 --> 17:47.920
Leave me alone

17:48.350 --> 17:49.400
How can that be done?

17:49.680 --> 17:50.350
You are my concubine

17:50.480 --> 17:51.790
How could I leave you alone?

17:52.790 --> 17:54.680
If you continue to be so arrogant

17:54.920 --> 17:56.200
Be careful I'll kill you

17:56.790 --> 17:57.350
look

17:58.070 --> 17:59.110
You have the strength to kill people

17:59.200 --> 18:00.550
But I don’t have the strength to walk.

18:10.070 --> 18:10.750
no

18:11.440 --> 18:12.550
I really can't walk anymore

18:13.110 --> 18:14.070
Think of something

18:14.310 --> 18:15.070
I won't leave

18:25.110 --> 18:26.310
I really have a way

18:27.200 --> 18:28.000
But

18:28.350 --> 18:29.510
You have to cooperate with me

18:46.550 --> 18:47.880
Let's go and change clothes.

18:48.030 --> 18:48.880
No one in the house

19:00.350 --> 19:01.440
Are you okay?

19:02.110 --> 19:02.640
immediately

19:03.200 --> 19:04.110
Why don't you just change your clothes?

19:04.200 --> 19:05.400
Why are you so lazy?

19:07.640 --> 19:08.350
I changed it

19:10.510 --> 19:10.790
alright

19:10.880 --> 19:11.200
Walk

19:11.640 --> 19:12.200
Let's go

19:15.680 --> 19:16.070
alright

19:23.920 --> 19:24.720
you

19:25.270 --> 19:26.480
So white and clean

19:27.110 --> 19:27.480
no

19:28.110 --> 19:28.400
come over

19:29.920 --> 19:30.510
What for?

19:33.830 --> 19:34.830
Don't move

19:35.030 --> 19:36.160
What are you doing?

19:36.350 --> 19:37.270
Are you going to pretend to be a village woman?

19:37.400 --> 19:38.960
Do you look like a village woman?

19:43.960 --> 19:45.110
What is this doing?

19:45.790 --> 19:46.830
You'll know later

19:59.750 --> 20:00.480
tie into clothes

20:00.880 --> 20:01.590
Why

20:01.720 --> 20:03.110
Of course I want you to pretend to be a pregnant woman

20:03.480 --> 20:04.160
You have a big belly

20:04.270 --> 20:05.510
So I can borrow a car

20:05.960 --> 20:07.160
Don’t you want to leave?

20:07.270 --> 20:08.030
That's the husband

20:08.200 --> 20:09.550
I'll take you into the city by car

20:10.590 --> 20:11.270
pregnant woman

20:11.350 --> 20:12.110
hurry up

20:16.720 --> 20:18.110
How can I stop this?

20:20.480 --> 20:22.270
can you hurry up

20:23.110 --> 20:24.750
It would be nice to have a car to sit in

20:24.880 --> 20:26.000
Too slow

20:26.200 --> 20:27.000
No hurries

20:27.200 --> 20:27.750
Afraid that people don’t know

20:27.830 --> 20:29.270
There is straw in your belly

20:31.640 --> 20:33.070
A gentleman talks but does not use his hands

20:33.350 --> 20:34.550
I'm not a gentleman

20:34.720 --> 20:36.240
I'm a lady

20:36.590 --> 20:37.640
you lady

20:37.750 --> 20:38.350
Look at you like this

20:38.480 --> 20:40.240
Which one of the virtuous and virtuous ones is related?

20:41.070 --> 20:42.200
I let you say

20:43.310 --> 20:44.350
I'm warning you not to fight

20:44.480 --> 20:45.200
I fought back

20:50.310 --> 20:52.030
Old lady, stop crying

20:52.440 --> 20:54.240
The mountain goods are gone, we can fight again

20:54.350 --> 20:55.480
Get angry with those people

20:55.590 --> 20:56.310
not worth it

20:56.830 --> 20:57.640
not worth it

21:03.270 --> 21:03.750
old man

21:04.270 --> 21:04.920
Excuse me

21:05.400 --> 21:06.720
How far is it from Bingzhou?

21:07.350 --> 21:08.440
Still far away

21:09.440 --> 21:10.880
There's still more than a hundred miles to go

21:11.960 --> 21:13.110
This injury on your face

21:13.480 --> 21:14.440
What happened?

21:16.440 --> 21:17.110
Forget it

21:17.680 --> 21:18.590
Hurry up

21:18.720 --> 21:19.240
Recently

21:19.310 --> 21:20.440
Don't know what's going on

21:20.680 --> 21:22.000
Officers and soldiers came from the mountain

21:22.590 --> 21:24.030
Still on the official road ahead

21:24.160 --> 21:25.830
Suddenly a checkpoint was set up

21:26.590 --> 21:27.350
My wife and I

21:27.440 --> 21:29.240
I was originally going to the market

21:29.240 --> 21:29.680
What to take

21:29.790 --> 21:31.400
Who knows that group of people

21:31.590 --> 21:33.240
Worse than bandits

21:36.240 --> 21:37.960
Eat roast rabbit tonight

21:40.110 --> 21:40.440
bring here

21:40.590 --> 21:41.590
This is what we got at the market

21:41.720 --> 21:42.510
for salt

21:44.030 --> 21:44.480
hold

21:44.590 --> 21:45.110
we all day long

21:45.110 --> 21:45.830
Follow Governor Sun

21:45.960 --> 21:46.720
General Guo Zhi

21:46.830 --> 21:47.680
crusade against rebellion

21:47.790 --> 21:49.440
What's wrong with eating some of your rabbits?

21:50.200 --> 21:50.640
roll

21:51.000 --> 21:51.830
Xiaolangjun

21:52.000 --> 21:53.790
Never take the official route

21:54.030 --> 21:55.640
Those people are so bad

21:56.000 --> 21:57.480
Big girl and little daughter-in-law

21:57.590 --> 21:59.310
They won't let it go

21:59.750 --> 22:01.680
Your wife is young

22:01.880 --> 22:02.270
Say it again

22:02.350 --> 22:03.830
Scared the baby in her belly

22:04.110 --> 22:06.000
That would be even more serious

22:06.920 --> 22:07.830
In addition to officialdom

22:08.110 --> 22:08.590
What other paths are there?

22:08.680 --> 22:09.750
Can it be bypassed?

22:11.240 --> 22:12.440
Go up the mountain from here

22:12.640 --> 22:14.960
There is a path going west

22:15.440 --> 22:17.030
But that's a long way around

22:17.400 --> 22:19.350
And the roads are all difficult to walk on.

22:19.750 --> 22:21.110
Wait until it gets dark

22:21.590 --> 22:23.200
It would be even worse to leave

22:24.880 --> 22:25.750
Thank you, husband

22:26.920 --> 22:28.590
Remember not to take the official route

22:29.240 --> 22:30.640
Don't take the official route

22:31.160 --> 22:32.550
Don't take the official route

22:44.030 --> 22:46.030
It’s been a long time since I’ve eaten your steamed melon cheese.

22:46.510 --> 22:47.400
I'll try it

22:53.960 --> 22:55.270
Not bad

22:56.000 --> 22:56.960
What do you think of that Shi7ro?

22:57.070 --> 22:58.200
Li Yi

23:04.510 --> 23:05.590
This person

23:08.510 --> 23:09.920
He is in the royal family

23:10.030 --> 23:11.110
Not obvious

23:11.550 --> 23:13.070
I heard

23:13.550 --> 23:15.550
He was very naughty at first

23:16.030 --> 23:18.000
Make the late emperor furious

23:18.200 --> 23:20.030
Demoted him to the army

23:24.030 --> 23:26.070
I asked someone to check the Ministry of War files.

23:26.720 --> 23:29.000
When he was demoted to suppress the Western Army,

23:29.440 --> 23:30.920
Pei Xian gave his youngest son

23:31.000 --> 23:31.750
Pei Yuan

23:31.920 --> 23:32.920
Conglong Wuwei

23:33.070 --> 23:34.960
Also transferred to the Zhenxi Army

23:36.030 --> 23:36.960
thereafter

23:37.240 --> 23:38.440
Pei Yuan has always been with Li Yi

23:38.550 --> 23:39.480
inseparable

23:39.720 --> 23:41.000
Always on the same team

23:41.880 --> 23:43.550
Pei Xian, the old fox

23:43.750 --> 23:45.070
eyes higher than head

23:45.440 --> 23:46.310
He let his son

23:46.440 --> 23:47.510
follower

23:47.640 --> 23:49.270
It must not be underestimated

23:51.110 --> 23:52.640
But I heard

23:53.200 --> 23:55.200
Pei Xian had ten sons in total

23:55.590 --> 23:57.000
Some are in the military

23:57.350 --> 23:58.830
Some gave up martial arts and followed literature

23:59.160 --> 24:00.880
Some became Taoist priests

24:02.920 --> 24:05.550
As well-planned as the Grand Governor

24:06.240 --> 24:07.480
How could Pei Xian know?

24:07.550 --> 24:09.680
Will the Grand Governor raise the flag of justice?

24:10.480 --> 24:11.680
Since I don't know

24:11.880 --> 24:13.830
How could he make plans so early?

24:14.070 --> 24:15.550
to pay attention to one

24:15.790 --> 24:17.240
Demoted to the army

24:17.480 --> 24:20.440
And what about the emperor’s grandson who has fallen out of favor?

24:34.510 --> 24:35.110
What's wrong

24:39.110 --> 24:40.240
Why are my hands so hot?

24:41.880 --> 24:43.400
It's okay, let's go

24:48.510 --> 24:49.720
Come and show me

25:06.310 --> 25:07.270
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

25:09.270 --> 25:10.160
this is nothing

25:10.680 --> 25:11.240
gone

25:11.440 --> 25:12.550
How do you go like this?

25:13.310 --> 25:14.350
Get up and carry you

25:18.000 --> 25:18.480
Come up

26:19.400 --> 26:19.920
woke up

26:20.350 --> 26:21.350
Do you want some water?

26:27.550 --> 26:28.590
where is this

26:29.830 --> 26:30.920
What about a place like this?

26:31.070 --> 26:32.440
Usually when hunters go up to the mountains to hunt,

26:32.550 --> 26:33.510
For resting feet

26:34.440 --> 26:35.550
It was getting late just now

26:36.110 --> 26:37.790
I only found one herbal medicine

26:37.960 --> 26:38.640
I put it on you

26:38.830 --> 26:39.830
I don't know if it will work or not.

26:42.640 --> 26:43.920
I'm not that squeamish

26:44.790 --> 26:45.400
old woman

26:45.400 --> 26:46.240
do not Cry

26:46.720 --> 26:48.550
The mountain goods are gone, we can fight again

26:48.550 --> 26:49.400
Get angry with those people

26:50.110 --> 26:50.960
not worth it

26:51.310 --> 26:52.160
not worth it

26:52.160 --> 26:53.510
Just don't think about it

26:53.830 --> 26:55.160
What should I do if I get sick from this anger?

26:55.270 --> 26:57.240
The trip is coming soon

26:57.480 --> 26:59.110
Old lady, please slow down a little bit.

26:59.270 --> 27:00.310
knew

27:00.790 --> 27:01.310
old man

27:01.720 --> 27:02.200
who

27:08.880 --> 27:09.110
old man

27:09.240 --> 27:10.510
Why is it you?

27:10.830 --> 27:12.310
Why are you here?

27:12.440 --> 27:13.110
who is it

27:13.240 --> 27:15.110
The young couple we met today

27:15.240 --> 27:16.310
You said it was a coincidence or not?

27:16.830 --> 27:17.590
Yeah

27:20.110 --> 27:20.960
It really is

27:21.110 --> 27:22.350
Sit down, sit down

27:24.510 --> 27:25.790
A little more generous

27:25.960 --> 27:27.400
Multi-point meat

27:27.510 --> 27:29.510
Taste the real pheasant

27:30.350 --> 27:30.720
Thank you, mother-in-law

27:30.880 --> 27:32.270
Drink more to warm yourself up

27:32.510 --> 27:33.240
have a taste

27:34.110 --> 27:35.000
This pheasant

27:35.110 --> 27:36.640
My old man just hit me

27:36.750 --> 27:38.110
The soup is delicious

27:38.240 --> 27:40.070
Serve more meat Serve some more meat

27:40.240 --> 27:41.270
Thank you, mother-in-law

27:41.440 --> 27:43.480
Eat more, eat more

27:45.000 --> 27:46.200
My old man

27:46.270 --> 27:47.960
I also like to drink the soup I cook.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.440
But it's a pity for me

27:49.640 --> 27:50.000
Couldn't give it to him

27:50.110 --> 27:51.550
Give birth to a son and a half daughter

27:52.640 --> 27:54.640
If only I had a daughter like you

27:55.030 --> 27:56.070
How nice

27:57.790 --> 27:59.310
Come on old man

28:00.240 --> 28:01.350
You have worked hard

28:04.070 --> 28:04.350
How about it

28:04.480 --> 28:05.350
Delicious to drink

28:05.720 --> 28:06.480
You young people

28:06.590 --> 28:07.510
Eat more meat

28:07.830 --> 28:08.590
I have to rush tomorrow

28:08.750 --> 28:10.240
long mountain road

28:10.400 --> 28:11.880
Only when you are full can you have strength

28:13.240 --> 28:14.000
By the way, husband

28:14.400 --> 28:15.270
It's so late

28:15.480 --> 28:16.680
Why did you suddenly come back?

28:19.000 --> 28:19.720
Forget it

28:20.200 --> 28:20.880
My wife and I

28:20.960 --> 28:22.440
I was originally going to the market

28:22.590 --> 28:23.440
The results of it

28:23.640 --> 28:24.680
The salt was not replaced

28:24.920 --> 28:25.510
thing

28:25.720 --> 28:27.350
They were also snatched away by those officers and soldiers.

28:27.750 --> 28:30.110
The old lady thinks about things and is unwilling to give in.

28:30.830 --> 28:31.680
Don't force me

28:31.920 --> 28:33.310
Go back to the mountains and wander around again

28:33.640 --> 28:35.920
Let's see if we can hunt a few more mountain tigers.

28:36.270 --> 28:37.070
The results of it

28:37.310 --> 28:39.000
I only caught this pheasant

28:40.030 --> 28:41.640
It's getting dark soon

28:42.110 --> 28:42.720
I know

28:42.790 --> 28:44.400
There's a place to stay here

28:44.750 --> 28:45.590
did not expect

28:46.000 --> 28:47.270
I also met you

28:48.070 --> 28:50.160
Do you think this is fate?

28:50.310 --> 28:51.070
Yeah yeah

28:51.200 --> 28:52.030
yes

28:52.160 --> 28:53.030
Just heard the noise

28:53.160 --> 28:54.070
I thought he was a bad guy

28:55.680 --> 28:56.310
And you

28:56.440 --> 28:57.960
Lead your wife on the way

28:58.310 --> 29:00.160
It is necessary to have multiple eyes

29:00.680 --> 29:01.640
This world

29:03.200 --> 29:04.070
Very messy

29:11.480 --> 29:12.550
yes

29:14.270 --> 29:15.240
drink soup drink soup

29:16.200 --> 29:16.920
drink soup drink soup

29:17.030 --> 29:17.510
drink soup drink soup

29:17.640 --> 29:18.550
eat more

29:19.110 --> 29:19.510
Come

29:23.550 --> 29:24.070
old woman

29:24.160 --> 29:24.720
You eat too

29:24.830 --> 29:26.400
You eat, you eat

29:28.240 --> 29:28.790
You eat some

29:28.920 --> 29:29.880
Come again, come again

30:53.680 --> 30:54.550
Someone is coming

30:55.830 --> 30:57.240
There are people riding horses

30:57.790 --> 30:58.830
Eighty percent of achievements are official.

30:58.960 --> 31:00.030
That group of officers and soldiers

31:02.680 --> 31:03.240
old woman

31:03.550 --> 31:04.400
old woman

31:04.590 --> 31:06.240
Get up, get up

31:06.350 --> 31:07.200
What's wrong

31:10.110 --> 31:11.920
Those two people might be hiding in front

31:12.440 --> 31:13.550
Surrounded by heavy arrows and crossbows

31:13.720 --> 31:14.110
yes

31:17.070 --> 31:18.680
This is what I was fine with in the past few years

31:18.790 --> 31:19.830
Dig your own cellar

31:20.000 --> 31:21.400
It was originally used to store mountain goods.

31:21.640 --> 31:22.200
size

31:22.310 --> 31:23.720
Just enough to hide two people

31:24.070 --> 31:24.510
you

31:24.680 --> 31:26.000
Take your wife with you immediately

31:26.110 --> 31:27.440
Hurry down and take shelter

31:27.920 --> 31:28.590
right

31:28.920 --> 31:29.400
no

31:29.790 --> 31:30.640
It’s you, my husband, who wants to hide.

31:30.750 --> 31:31.680
Hide in with your mother-in-law

31:31.830 --> 31:34.110
That group of people all know us.

31:34.110 --> 31:35.270
He won't do anything to us

31:35.510 --> 31:36.790
But you two are strangers

31:36.790 --> 31:38.240
If discovered by officers and soldiers

31:38.240 --> 31:39.480
On the contrary, it is more dangerous

31:39.480 --> 31:41.240
My wife and I can't escape either.

31:41.240 --> 31:41.480
Yeah

31:41.590 --> 31:42.270
Get down quickly

31:42.440 --> 31:43.200
Come on, come on, good boy

31:43.310 --> 31:44.550
Quick, quick, quick

31:44.720 --> 31:45.030
My daughter is not afraid

31:45.200 --> 31:45.550
hurry up

31:53.750 --> 31:55.240
Search if there is a stranger

31:55.240 --> 31:56.110
Kill immediately without mercy

31:59.750 --> 32:00.270
Come

32:01.440 --> 32:01.750
Shop here

32:01.920 --> 32:02.240
quick

32:14.240 --> 32:14.720
Junye

32:16.440 --> 32:17.920
We are hunters in the mountains

32:18.270 --> 32:19.480
Have you seen a young man?

32:19.590 --> 32:20.550
Look fair and clean

32:20.790 --> 32:21.640
like a scholar

32:22.240 --> 32:23.000
Junye

32:23.480 --> 32:25.160
Our ten miles and eight villages

32:25.310 --> 32:26.920
Where are the scholars?

32:27.030 --> 32:28.030
Mention reading

32:28.200 --> 32:29.720
Just Mr. Shan in town

32:30.160 --> 32:31.070
What are you talking about?

32:36.310 --> 32:37.030
Say or not

32:37.030 --> 32:38.310
Master, please spare your life, Master.

32:39.640 --> 32:41.830
We really don’t know anything

32:42.070 --> 32:42.920
take them out

32:43.030 --> 32:44.000
Take a walk

32:44.790 --> 32:45.510
Walk

32:56.510 --> 32:57.790
Junye Junye

32:57.920 --> 32:58.680
Spare your life, Master

32:59.110 --> 33:00.400
we don't know anything

33:01.440 --> 33:02.270
do not know anything

33:04.830 --> 33:05.200
Are you really

33:05.350 --> 33:06.350
Don’t know anything?

33:06.680 --> 33:08.110
Really don't know anything

33:08.790 --> 33:09.310
good

33:09.550 --> 33:11.200
Since you don't know anything

33:11.480 --> 33:12.750
Then let you go back

33:13.350 --> 33:14.030
loosen them

33:17.000 --> 33:17.480
Let's go

33:18.440 --> 33:19.350
Thank you, Junye

33:22.030 --> 33:22.480
Walk

36:07.190 --> 36:07.840
Where are they?

36:11.920 --> 36:12.880
died

36:13.880 --> 36:14.480
What

36:16.440 --> 36:18.000
I just went out to see

36:19.840 --> 36:21.280
Both men are dead

36:25.320 --> 36:26.360
Are you crazy

36:27.760 --> 36:29.110
Why did you sting me with a needle?

36:30.480 --> 36:32.150
If you hadn't stung me with a needle and knocked me out

36:32.280 --> 36:33.670
they won't die

36:33.840 --> 36:34.230
you know outside

36:34.400 --> 36:35.480
How many archers are there?

36:35.920 --> 36:37.230
Found out they were harboring us

36:37.230 --> 36:38.030
if we go out recklessly

36:38.150 --> 36:39.070
It's simply too late

36:39.360 --> 36:40.920
On the contrary, they will be killed immediately

36:41.070 --> 36:41.920
what about now

36:44.230 --> 36:45.230
If I had come out to save him at that time

36:45.230 --> 36:46.320
There's still a chance

36:47.710 --> 36:48.840
But you don't want to give it a try

36:49.800 --> 36:50.360
you

36:51.150 --> 36:52.880
He's just a rat who is greedy for life and afraid of death.

37:01.280 --> 37:01.880
people like you

37:01.880 --> 37:02.920
Still have the nerve to drink soup

37:03.800 --> 37:05.000
ungrateful villain

37:05.110 --> 37:05.710
I am

37:05.960 --> 37:06.670
just kill me

38:26.110 --> 38:26.920
benefactor

38:27.190 --> 38:28.480
I was wrong today

38:28.760 --> 38:29.550
someday

38:30.960 --> 38:33.110
I will definitely avenge you
