=Episode 24=

01:43.065 --> 01:45.472
(Boundary Barrel)

02:03.828 --> 02:04.947
Governor.

02:04.948 --> 02:06.268
Already sent them?

02:06.547 --> 02:08.156
When Mrs. Wei got into the vehicle,

02:08.157 --> 02:09.426
he was reluctant to leave here.

02:09.427 --> 02:10.747
He cried sadly

02:11.228 --> 02:12.866
and wanted to accompany the governor

02:12.867 --> 02:14.027
to remain on the Tong Border.

02:14.147 --> 02:15.426
I advise madam

02:15.427 --> 02:16.867
to take good care of the young master.

02:17.068 --> 02:18.667
After this war is over,

02:18.668 --> 02:20.391
they will be brought back here.

02:21.867 --> 02:22.947
Kali ini, Tentera Zhenxi

02:22.948 --> 02:24.828
conspired with the Cui Family Army.

02:25.027 --> 02:27.988
This war
will determine life and death.

02:28.668 --> 02:30.027
It will end.

02:30.828 --> 02:32.146
Somewhat

02:32.147 --> 02:34.067
we will not come back here again.

02:48.972 --> 02:53.253
(West Door)

02:58.581 --> 03:00.511
(West Door)

03:02.516 --> 03:03.835
Chang'er.

03:14.068 --> 03:15.708
Tuan Shiqi.

03:27.587 --> 03:30.307
One two three.

04:05.569 --> 04:08.577
(Boundary Barrel)

04:20.828 --> 04:22.947
Governor. The Zhenxi Army allied
with the Cui Family Army

04:22.948 --> 04:24.068
and attack here.

04:24.267 --> 04:25.708
We protect you first.

04:25.907 --> 04:27.027
As long as we live,

04:27.347 --> 04:28.600
we still have a chance.

04:31.027 --> 04:31.708
Go?

04:32.907 --> 04:34.587
Where else can we go?

04:35.628 --> 04:37.628
Exit the Capital City of Xichang

04:37.667 --> 04:39.227
and escaped from the Tong Border.

04:39.347 --> 04:41.467
Now, we're out
of the Barrel Border again.

04:41.748 --> 04:43.586
Where else can we go?

04:43.587 --> 04:44.747
Governor.

04:44.748 --> 04:46.666
The Zhenxi Army allied
with the Cui Family Army.

04:46.667 --> 04:48.388
The enemy is many times our number.

04:48.748 --> 04:50.067
If we stay at the Tong Border,

04:50.068 --> 04:51.226
we can still survive for a while.

04:51.227 --> 04:52.466
However, out of nowhere

04:52.467 --> 04:54.148
The Zhenxi army entered the border.

04:54.227 --> 04:55.748
How do we survive?

04:56.267 --> 04:58.227
Both armies are fighting
and now it is too late.

04:58.347 --> 05:01.148
Governor, let's go.

05:05.107 --> 05:07.346
During the Battle of the Han Sea,

05:07.347 --> 05:09.708
the Khagan's soldiers are ten times more
numerous than ours.

05:10.147 --> 05:12.067
I lead the army to resist

05:12.068 --> 05:13.708
and blood stained my battle shirt.

05:13.828 --> 05:15.748
I almost lost one of my arms.

05:15.868 --> 05:18.068
Didn't I still win?

05:19.068 --> 05:21.107
There are tens of thousands of soldiers in the city

05:21.227 --> 05:23.308
still against the enemy.

05:23.548 --> 05:25.628
I can't ignore them.

05:26.988 --> 05:28.587
I will not go

05:30.308 --> 05:31.948
Bring his great-grandson here.

05:32.271 --> 05:33.502
Of.

06:07.619 --> 06:08.896
Sun Jing.

06:09.068 --> 06:10.482
It's reached this stage,

06:10.587 --> 06:12.188
you still refuse to give up?

06:16.941 --> 06:18.138
Come on.

06:27.428 --> 06:29.107
Now, the Tong border has been invaded.

06:29.828 --> 06:31.107
You will definitely lose.

06:32.027 --> 06:33.587
If you release his great-grandson,

06:34.388 --> 06:35.547
i won't kill you

06:35.628 --> 06:36.507
On that day, your father

06:36.508 --> 06:38.547
crawling and pleading in front of me.

06:38.907 --> 06:41.388
If he didn't pretend to be dead
and run away,

06:41.628 --> 06:42.627
he has no chance

06:42.628 --> 06:44.628
to be the illegitimate emperor
in the capital.

06:44.988 --> 06:47.987
Today, his great-grandson
is in my hands.

06:48.068 --> 06:50.188
I am the rightful emperor.

06:50.388 --> 06:52.187
In your words,

06:52.188 --> 06:54.227
do you want me to hand over his great-grandson?

06:54.907 --> 06:56.347
What do you want?

06:58.267 --> 06:59.867
You and your army

06:59.868 --> 07:01.587
retreat from the Tong Border now.

07:01.787 --> 07:04.067
Tell the illegitimate emperor
in the capital to issue orders

07:04.068 --> 07:05.347
and tell everyone

07:05.388 --> 07:06.987
that he ascended the throne
in the wrong way.

07:07.027 --> 07:09.467
He will return the throne
to his great-grandson.

07:10.907 --> 07:13.628
Given the
current state of border warfare,

07:14.508 --> 07:15.187
it feels like you

07:15.188 --> 07:16.787
not worth negotiating with me.

07:19.068 --> 07:19.446
Mari.

07:19.447 --> 07:20.491
(West Door)

07:20.628 --> 07:21.667
Li Ni.

07:22.308 --> 07:23.906
This boy is the only one

07:23.907 --> 07:25.828
descendant of the late crown prince.

07:26.308 --> 07:27.627
In your Li Family,

07:27.628 --> 07:29.347
he is the only legitimate descendant.

07:29.748 --> 07:31.508
If he were killed today,

07:31.628 --> 07:32.867
how do you want to be responsible

07:32.868 --> 07:34.187
in front of everyone?

07:34.188 --> 07:36.068
how is your father,

07:36.388 --> 07:37.706
illegitimate emperor

07:37.707 --> 07:39.308
should be responsible?

07:39.508 --> 07:41.226
Do not mind me!

07:41.227 --> 07:42.507
Kill Rebel Sun!

07:42.508 --> 07:44.067
Restore the peace of the country!

07:44.068 --> 07:45.346
Kill him!

07:45.347 --> 07:46.388
Sun Jing!

07:47.147 --> 07:48.467
You are a famous warrior.

07:49.227 --> 07:51.508
I didn't think you considered a little boy
as your protector!

07:52.068 --> 07:54.146
You will be laughed at.

07:54.147 --> 07:56.068
No need to stimulate me.

07:56.707 --> 07:58.628
If you don't back down,

07:59.267 --> 08:00.906
I will act.

08:00.907 --> 08:02.268
Stop!

08:08.227 --> 08:09.828
I will save his great-grandson

08:10.667 --> 08:11.947
at the cost of my life.

08:11.948 --> 08:13.586
- Tuan Shiqi!
- Tuan Shiqi!

08:13.587 --> 08:15.587
Mr. Shiqi, you can't do that!

08:16.948 --> 08:18.146
- Tuan Shiqi!
- Tuan Shiqi!

08:18.147 --> 08:19.067
Do not mind me.

08:19.068 --> 08:19.867
Jangan, Tuan Shiqi.

08:19.868 --> 08:22.188
Kill Rebel Sun, recover...

08:33.308 --> 08:34.027
Tuan Shiqi!

08:34.028 --> 08:35.506
Don't be like that. Back here.

08:35.507 --> 08:36.988
Tuan Shiqi!

08:38.107 --> 08:39.588
Tuan Shiqi!

08:41.188 --> 08:42.348
Okay.

08:42.668 --> 08:44.748
King Qin is really brave.

08:45.028 --> 08:47.588
I will keep my promise.

08:48.268 --> 08:49.427
King of Qin.

08:49.747 --> 08:51.468
Kill yourself.

08:51.507 --> 08:53.027
Master Shiqi, don't be like that!

08:53.068 --> 08:53.586
Tuan Shiqi!

08:53.587 --> 08:54.947
Master Shiqi, don't be like that!

08:54.948 --> 08:56.228
- Master Shiqi!
- Just attack!

09:04.627 --> 09:07.588
Abang Shiqi. Jangan!

09:16.347 --> 09:20.307
Jangan, Abang Shiqi!

09:29.867 --> 09:30.307
Don't!

09:30.308 --> 09:32.268
Tuan Shiqi, jangan!

09:54.188 --> 09:55.468
King of Qin.

09:55.747 --> 09:58.027
His great-grandson on Sun Jing's side
is fake.

09:58.028 --> 09:59.667
The boy I brought here

09:59.668 --> 10:00.986
then his great-grandson is true.

10:00.987 --> 10:02.242
What?

10:04.587 --> 10:05.787
Li Ni.

10:06.028 --> 10:08.226
It's okay if you
refuse to save his great-grandchild.

10:08.227 --> 10:10.628
You don't have to play evil tricks.

10:10.867 --> 10:12.626
You want to use
a fake great-grandson

10:12.627 --> 10:13.986
to get a chance

10:13.987 --> 10:15.667
kill his great-grandson legally.

10:17.788 --> 10:19.067
Governor.

10:19.188 --> 10:21.547
You mean, this boy I brought
is his fake great-grandson?

10:21.548 --> 10:23.147
How do you prove it?

10:23.148 --> 10:25.868
that you
captured the real great-grandson?

10:28.148 --> 10:29.267
His great-grandson has

10:29.268 --> 10:31.228
seal of the late crown prince.

10:31.428 --> 10:33.427
I robbed people and their seals

10:33.428 --> 10:35.988
from Han Chang.

10:36.028 --> 10:37.866
If you're in doubt,

10:37.867 --> 10:39.868
no need to negotiate anymore.

10:40.148 --> 10:41.947
I will continue to kill him.

10:41.948 --> 10:43.707
Stop. Put down your knife!

10:43.867 --> 10:45.588
Take action. Governor.

10:46.028 --> 10:47.706
The governor never doubted

10:47.707 --> 10:49.400
Panglima Yunchang, Han Chang?

10:49.400 --> 10:51.986
He was the old nobleman of the late
crown prince who was so obedient.

10:51.987 --> 10:53.667
After you kidnapped his great-grandson,

10:53.668 --> 10:55.586
why is he not tracking you?

10:55.587 --> 10:57.626
and gather people
to save his great-grandson?

10:57.627 --> 10:59.787
The seal of
the late crown prince,

10:59.867 --> 11:01.147
mengapa Panglima Yunchang

11:01.148 --> 11:02.386
put it down

11:02.387 --> 11:03.586
on this boy?

11:03.587 --> 11:04.907
He won't know

11:04.908 --> 11:06.386
that you can identify

11:06.387 --> 11:07.827
the identity of this boy

11:07.828 --> 11:09.108
after getting this thing.

11:09.227 --> 11:11.468
There is indeed a possibility of that.

11:12.948 --> 11:15.746
All soldiers will be promoted and
given a reward of ten thousand tahil

11:15.747 --> 11:16.986
after killing Sun Jing!

11:16.987 --> 11:20.667
Attack!

11:21.987 --> 11:23.187
Attack!

11:23.707 --> 11:25.067
Take his great-grandson to go first.

11:25.068 --> 11:26.508
He's still useful.

11:39.467 --> 11:40.680
His great-grandson.

11:42.028 --> 11:43.352
His great-grandson.

11:59.148 --> 12:00.427
Fifth Han.

12:02.447 --> 12:03.703
It's ok.

12:03.718 --> 12:04.929
I came to save you.

12:04.930 --> 12:06.172
Come on.

14:17.227 --> 14:18.532
Sun Jing.

14:18.908 --> 14:20.827
On the day you killed the emperor,

14:20.828 --> 14:21.746
have you ever imagined

14:21.747 --> 14:23.813
that you
will be defeated badly?

14:27.308 --> 14:28.787
King of Qin.

14:28.908 --> 14:30.386
Keep killing

14:30.387 --> 14:31.868
just such a rebel.

14:45.507 --> 14:47.628
I am highly skilled.

14:48.347 --> 14:50.748
If I hadn't been poisoned,

14:50.867 --> 14:52.667
no matter how many people

14:52.668 --> 14:54.787
not comparable to me

14:57.908 --> 15:00.067
Ignorant boy.

15:00.227 --> 15:02.628
Don't you try to kill me.

15:03.227 --> 15:05.748
I won't let you do it.

15:43.188 --> 15:44.907
This pair of jed counters

15:44.908 --> 15:46.588
really smooth

15:47.987 --> 15:50.988
One person takes half.

15:52.268 --> 15:54.748
I will use it forever.

15:55.668 --> 15:57.228
I will not ignore you.

15:59.428 --> 16:00.947
We will not be separated.

17:20.548 --> 17:22.628
(In the first year of Tiantai,
Dayu Dynasty,)

17:22.748 --> 17:24.827
(Sun Jing is defeated at the Tong Border)

17:24.828 --> 17:26.348
(and killed himself.)

17:27.107 --> 17:28.827
(His wife, Mrs. Wei)

17:28.828 --> 17:29.787
(and his eldest son)

17:29.788 --> 17:31.987
(caught on the run.)

17:32.387 --> 17:35.267
(Since then, Sun Jing's rebellion)

17:35.427 --> 17:37.348
(completely sedated.)

17:41.190 --> 17:42.372
Be careful.

17:42.667 --> 17:44.076
Take it there.

17:45.028 --> 17:46.404
Mari.

17:46.947 --> 17:47.866
How?

17:47.867 --> 17:48.787
Mari.

17:48.788 --> 17:50.307
- Slowly.
- We go there.

17:50.308 --> 17:51.106
Save this.

17:51.107 --> 17:52.068
Put it there.

17:52.387 --> 17:53.186
Slowly.

17:53.187 --> 17:54.827
- Come on.
- Let me help.

17:54.828 --> 17:55.868
There's more there.

17:56.667 --> 17:57.772
Mari.

17:57.788 --> 17:59.067
Lieutenant.

17:59.068 --> 17:59.827
Why?

17:59.828 --> 18:02.515
Someone kidnapped his great-grandson
in the chaos earlier.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.426
- Quickly tell people to chase him.
- Yes.

18:04.427 --> 18:06.475
How about King Qin?

18:06.947 --> 18:08.067
Let me tell him.

18:08.068 --> 18:08.707
Go away.

18:08.708 --> 18:10.014
Good.

18:11.468 --> 18:12.842
Ying.

18:12.947 --> 18:13.987
You are struggling.

18:13.988 --> 18:14.707
With your help,

18:14.708 --> 18:16.146
only then did I find
his real great-grandson.

18:16.147 --> 18:17.426
Now, Sun Jing is dead.

18:17.427 --> 18:19.146
We just need to bring his great-grandson

18:19.147 --> 18:20.467
back to the palace

18:21.387 --> 18:22.386
Shiqi.

18:22.387 --> 18:23.426
I must reveal something

18:23.427 --> 18:25.108
against you

18:25.347 --> 18:27.027
The boy I brought

18:27.028 --> 18:28.427
is fake.

18:29.228 --> 18:30.586
His real great-grandson

18:30.587 --> 18:32.027
indeed the boy
kidnapped by Sun Jing.

18:32.028 --> 18:33.586
I have arranged people

18:33.587 --> 18:36.507
looking for an opportunity in the chaos
to save his real grandchild.

18:36.667 --> 18:38.866
However, I don't think
anyone acted first.

18:38.867 --> 18:40.146
We must think of a way quickly

18:40.147 --> 18:41.907
and chasing his real great-grandson.

18:46.667 --> 18:47.907
Shiqi!

18:48.613 --> 18:49.692
Wake up.

18:49.748 --> 18:50.990
Go away.

18:51.587 --> 18:52.386
Go away.

18:52.387 --> 18:54.108
Let's count.

18:54.228 --> 18:55.426
Strengthen again.

18:55.427 --> 18:57.028
Transport here. Go away.

19:01.907 --> 19:03.667
Master Shiqi, we can't catch up.

19:04.548 --> 19:06.626
They were able to save his great-grandson
in a chaotic situation.

19:06.627 --> 19:07.906
Their actions are very fast.

19:07.907 --> 19:09.987
Presumably they were Commander Han
and his subordinates.

19:09.988 --> 19:11.226
It seems that his great-grandson is safe...

19:11.226 --> 19:13.100
How can we be sure
that they are Han Chang

19:13.100 --> 19:13.847
and his subordinates?

19:13.847 --> 19:15.747
What if he was kidnapped
by the bad guys?

19:16.308 --> 19:17.586
I once made a promise with Mistress Xiao

19:17.587 --> 19:19.027
to save his great-grandson.

19:19.028 --> 19:20.666
However, you brought a fake majesty's great-grandson

19:20.667 --> 19:21.547
to trick Sun Jing earlier.

19:21.548 --> 19:23.707
Have you ever thought
that if he trusts you,

19:23.708 --> 19:25.440
he might do evil things
to his real grandchild?

19:25.440 --> 19:26.226
I used to think about it.

19:26.326 --> 19:27.920
Since you know
it's high risk,

19:27.920 --> 19:29.092
why are you doing it again?

19:29.947 --> 19:32.000
I have considered it
many times in my heart.

19:32.000 --> 19:32.987
I have 80 percent confidence

19:32.988 --> 19:34.267
to convince Sun Jing

19:34.268 --> 19:35.426
and save his great-grandson.

19:35.427 --> 19:36.868
80 percent?

19:36.988 --> 19:38.667
What about the other 20 percent?

19:41.468 --> 19:42.626
It's good if we

19:42.627 --> 19:44.227
can save his great-grandson.

19:44.468 --> 19:46.386
If an accident occurs,

19:46.387 --> 19:47.827
it's my fault,

19:47.828 --> 19:49.067
nothing to do with you

19:49.068 --> 19:50.946
An accident

19:50.947 --> 19:52.186
is your fault

19:52.187 --> 19:53.842
and have nothing to do with me?

19:56.028 --> 19:57.348
Shiqi.

19:57.627 --> 19:58.227
It must be me

19:58.228 --> 19:59.747
explain everything?

19:59.867 --> 20:01.868
Don't you understand it too?

20:01.947 --> 20:03.067
If you really

20:03.068 --> 20:04.467
brought his great-grandson back to the capital,

20:04.468 --> 20:05.906
state of the palace

20:05.907 --> 20:06.866
will experience turmoil,

20:06.867 --> 20:08.467
not?

20:10.068 --> 20:11.507
I understand your thoughts.

20:11.508 --> 20:14.106
You want him to appoint his great-grandson
as crown prince.

20:14.107 --> 20:15.426
However, have you ever thought about this?

20:15.427 --> 20:17.827
Our country has just become stable
and the people's situation is not guaranteed.

20:17.828 --> 20:18.747
Does everyone

20:18.748 --> 20:20.307
will agree with your thoughts?

20:20.308 --> 20:21.346
Can the palace

20:21.347 --> 20:22.307
experiencing turmoil

20:22.308 --> 20:23.588
one more time?

20:29.308 --> 20:31.588
You are full of justification and reason.

20:32.228 --> 20:34.420
Why didn't you consult
me ​​first?

20:34.788 --> 20:36.068
Because you know

20:36.387 --> 20:38.267
that I won't agree, right?

20:40.107 --> 20:41.106
Of.

20:41.107 --> 20:43.106
His Highness is very brave.

20:43.107 --> 20:43.906
I don't deserve it

20:43.907 --> 20:45.067
intervened earlier.

20:45.068 --> 20:46.307
I have to let you sacrifice yourself

20:46.308 --> 20:48.108
and praised by all.

20:48.228 --> 20:49.827
When I pass through here,

20:49.828 --> 20:50.707
I will too

20:50.708 --> 20:52.028
burn incense for you.

21:22.068 --> 21:23.146
Lieutenant.

21:23.147 --> 21:25.427
Everything is my fault.

21:25.508 --> 21:27.467
I could not
save his great-grandson.

21:28.708 --> 21:30.427
Nothing to do with you.

21:32.548 --> 21:33.626
I told you

21:33.627 --> 21:35.507
bring people
to save his great-grandson,

21:35.508 --> 21:37.148
but I didn't think so

21:37.587 --> 21:39.628
there's a scout there.

21:40.187 --> 21:41.654
Somewhat

21:42.107 --> 21:43.027
they are Han Commanders

21:43.028 --> 21:44.348
and his subordinates.

21:44.828 --> 21:46.747
Of course you can't fight them.

21:50.788 --> 21:52.148
How is your wound?

21:53.268 --> 21:54.828
I am fine.

21:56.228 --> 21:58.187
Kata Is Duo,

21:58.228 --> 22:00.346
King Qin scolded you
in front of everyone

22:00.347 --> 22:01.947
and argue with you.

22:06.228 --> 22:07.427
Don't mention his name.

22:13.667 --> 22:14.946
Sun Jing left in a hurry.

22:14.947 --> 22:16.067
He continued

22:16.068 --> 22:17.427
set fire to the entire reading room.

22:17.708 --> 22:19.868
Most of the items inside
were also burned.

22:19.988 --> 22:21.547
I bring people

22:21.548 --> 22:22.146
find all this

22:22.147 --> 22:23.788
under the rubble.

22:24.788 --> 22:27.186
Finally, I know
that there are people in the drawing room

22:27.187 --> 22:28.866
conspired with Sun Jing
secretly.

22:28.867 --> 22:30.667
They are often in contact.

22:30.708 --> 22:33.067
However, no name is written
on this letter.

22:33.068 --> 22:35.388
After all, they use secret terms.

22:35.427 --> 22:36.386
So, we haven't seen it yet

22:36.387 --> 22:37.907
this guy for a while.

22:38.508 --> 22:39.386
Shiqi.

22:39.387 --> 22:41.106
After returning to Xichang Capital,

22:41.107 --> 22:42.987
we still need to be careful.

22:44.587 --> 22:45.828
Of.

22:46.788 --> 22:48.720
Li Ni occupies the Tong Border

22:48.720 --> 22:50.576
and sent people to report him
to the palace quickly.

22:50.576 --> 22:52.866
He brought Sun Jing's body back again.

22:52.867 --> 22:55.426
All the dignitaries
praised him in the ballirung seri.

22:55.427 --> 22:58.108
He made another big contribution.

22:58.308 --> 22:59.386
As his brother,

22:59.387 --> 23:01.586
it's hard for me to compete with him.

23:01.587 --> 23:03.507
It feels like the Eastern Palace

23:03.508 --> 23:06.227
will fall into Li Ni's hands.

23:06.907 --> 23:08.348
There is an extraordinary person

23:08.867 --> 23:10.787
want to meet the noble.

23:10.788 --> 23:13.028
He sent people
to fetch the noble many times.

23:13.147 --> 23:14.467
I can't stand him

23:14.468 --> 23:15.666
and meet him once.

23:15.667 --> 23:16.426
He said,

23:16.427 --> 23:17.828
he has a great way

23:17.947 --> 23:19.947
and can help His Majesty.

23:22.107 --> 23:23.626
This person said his surname was Liu.

23:23.627 --> 23:25.467
He was once Cui Yi's adopted son.

23:25.468 --> 23:27.067
After I talked to him,

23:27.068 --> 23:29.586
I found that his thoughts were profound

23:29.587 --> 23:31.427
and have such a background.

23:31.828 --> 23:34.548
This person must
be hostile to the Cui Family.

23:34.587 --> 23:35.907
We can use it.

23:40.187 --> 23:42.467
I've been wanting to see you for a long time,
Young Master Liu.

23:45.228 --> 23:46.868
His Highness praised me too much.

23:46.947 --> 23:48.588
His Highness will not want to see me.

23:50.347 --> 23:51.547
Now, I'm just one

23:51.548 --> 23:53.186
which is nothing.

23:53.187 --> 23:55.067
Since you are nothing,

23:55.068 --> 23:56.946
how do you want to help me?

23:56.947 --> 23:59.106
The King of Qin took back the Tong Border

23:59.107 --> 24:00.667
and defeat Sun Jing.

24:00.828 --> 24:02.907
This is a great service.

24:02.988 --> 24:04.267
After he returned to the capital,

24:04.268 --> 24:05.507
it must be him

24:05.508 --> 24:06.946
want to get the East Palace.

24:06.947 --> 24:09.227
As his brother,

24:10.667 --> 24:13.146
doesn't the noble one feel the danger?

24:13.147 --> 24:15.307
My eldest brother is still there.

24:15.308 --> 24:16.586
Usually, the eldest son will be appointed.

24:16.587 --> 24:18.067
Li Ni didn't stand a chance.

24:18.068 --> 24:18.866
What if Li Ni

24:18.867 --> 24:20.346
married Cui Yi's only child,

24:20.347 --> 24:21.426
Cui Family Army

24:21.427 --> 24:22.906
will obey Li Ni's instructions

24:22.907 --> 24:25.108
seperti Tentera Zhenxi?

24:25.468 --> 24:26.707
At that time,

24:26.708 --> 24:28.106
even the emperor

24:28.107 --> 24:30.068
unable to handle King Qin.

24:30.387 --> 24:33.227
Even the noble can't
seize the Eastern Palace anymore.

24:33.708 --> 24:34.787
Even the honorable

24:34.788 --> 24:37.148
can't be

24:37.828 --> 24:40.348
the prince relaxed again.

24:41.187 --> 24:43.507
Li Ni will marry
Cui's only daughter?

24:43.508 --> 24:45.547
They are already in personal contact.

24:45.548 --> 24:47.308
If not,

24:47.468 --> 24:48.467
why the Cui Family Army

24:48.468 --> 24:49.987
go save Pei Yuan

24:49.988 --> 24:52.626
just with a letter
from King Qin?

24:52.627 --> 24:54.467
Why did Cui Yi surrender Changzhou

24:54.468 --> 24:56.227
just because King Qin promised

24:56.228 --> 24:58.388
to bestow the title of
Commander-in-Chief Weiyang worthless?

24:58.587 --> 25:00.027
Mengapa Tentera Zhenxi

25:00.028 --> 25:01.106
willing to attack the Tong Border

25:01.107 --> 25:03.227
with the Cui Family Army?

25:05.907 --> 25:07.467
Oh it's like that.

25:09.387 --> 25:11.907
Actually, His Highness
had already thought carefully.

25:12.228 --> 25:13.146
Is that noble

25:13.147 --> 25:14.747
want to send people

25:15.187 --> 25:16.547
to kill the King of Qin

25:16.548 --> 25:18.028
on his way to the capital?

25:18.907 --> 25:20.507
However, the noble taste

25:20.508 --> 25:22.707
is it hard

25:22.867 --> 25:25.108
to kill the King of Qin
who was below

25:25.508 --> 25:27.267
the protection of thousands of soldiers?

25:29.387 --> 25:31.828
Young Master Liu has a good way?

25:33.627 --> 25:35.788
His Highness can take
unexpected actions.

25:36.228 --> 25:38.348
Start with Cui Lin.

25:38.627 --> 25:41.548
Make him worry first.

25:41.587 --> 25:43.427
After he was worried,

25:43.468 --> 25:45.588
he will make mistakes.

25:45.788 --> 25:47.028
At that time,

25:47.947 --> 25:50.267
Your Honor can take this opportunity

25:50.347 --> 25:52.068
to kill the King of Qin.

25:54.308 --> 25:56.267
This is indeed a good way.

25:56.268 --> 25:58.186
However, it is difficult to

25:58.187 --> 25:59.787
implement it.

25:59.788 --> 26:01.267
Do not worry.

26:01.468 --> 26:03.267
Since I suggest this way,

26:03.268 --> 26:05.787
I will take people there

26:05.788 --> 26:08.747
to help the noble.

26:08.748 --> 26:10.346
Once this is done,

26:10.347 --> 26:12.907
How can I thank
Mr. Young Liu?

26:14.667 --> 26:16.267
I do want to

26:16.268 --> 26:18.346
serve the noble.

26:18.347 --> 26:19.907
I don't want anything else.

26:20.468 --> 26:21.787
I just hope the noble

26:21.788 --> 26:23.308
move a group of people

26:23.347 --> 26:24.907
for me to direct.

26:30.427 --> 26:32.267
Many days have passed.

26:32.788 --> 26:34.866
The King of Qin was inside the border

26:34.867 --> 26:36.907
and we are out of bounds.

26:37.147 --> 26:39.068
Logically,

26:39.147 --> 26:40.427
not far.

26:47.867 --> 26:50.267
King Qin is not making sense.

26:50.268 --> 26:52.146
He didn't come here

26:52.147 --> 26:53.987
and don't send people either.

26:54.867 --> 26:55.987
Lieutenant.

26:55.988 --> 26:57.186
Speak up.

26:57.187 --> 26:58.067
Is the King of Qin

26:58.068 --> 26:59.707
really angry?

27:02.107 --> 27:03.947
Why are you so worried?

27:04.107 --> 27:05.787
King Qin is angry or not,

27:05.788 --> 27:07.388
what does it have to do with me?

27:08.508 --> 27:09.868
Look at it.

27:11.867 --> 27:13.067
You are really close

27:13.068 --> 27:14.946
with the previous King of Qin.

27:14.947 --> 27:16.987
Aren't you

27:16.988 --> 27:18.626
have a misunderstanding

27:18.627 --> 27:20.186
for the sake of his great-grandson this time?

27:20.187 --> 27:21.868
Taozi, what's up with you today?

27:21.947 --> 27:23.907
You don't fly on a normal day.

27:25.947 --> 27:27.426
I just thought about this.

27:27.427 --> 27:28.626
Is the King of Qin

27:28.627 --> 27:30.108
become ill?

27:30.387 --> 27:32.386
The weather has been changing lately.

27:32.387 --> 27:33.788
It was suddenly cold and hot.

27:34.028 --> 27:35.507
I heard,

27:35.508 --> 27:37.947
many people fell ill
inside the border.

27:38.107 --> 27:39.747
Is Duo pun

27:39.748 --> 27:41.626
caught a cold.

27:41.627 --> 27:43.467
If you are worried about Xie Chang'er,

27:43.468 --> 27:44.987
send medicine for him yourself.

27:45.587 --> 27:46.707
So.

27:46.748 --> 27:48.346
I will not go

27:48.347 --> 27:49.267
Lieutenant.

27:49.268 --> 27:51.787
If you don't care about King Qin,

27:51.788 --> 27:52.866
I won't even care

27:52.867 --> 27:54.068
Is Duo.

27:56.068 --> 27:58.148
I will not care about him.

28:19.468 --> 28:20.775
Is Duo.

28:22.548 --> 28:23.915
Taozi.

28:24.308 --> 28:25.707
Taozi, you finally came.

28:25.708 --> 28:27.118
What did the lieutenant say?

28:27.788 --> 28:29.426
He is still the same.

28:29.427 --> 28:31.227
I have been advising him for a long time.

28:31.228 --> 28:33.507
He also refused to mention the King of Qin.

28:33.508 --> 28:34.866
What should we do?

28:34.867 --> 28:35.787
When I came here,

28:35.788 --> 28:37.388
Bao and everyone tell me

28:37.587 --> 28:38.747
to ask you

28:38.748 --> 28:40.267
reconciled the lieutenant and Mr. Shiqi.

28:40.268 --> 28:40.866
You don't know

28:40.867 --> 28:41.507
that Mr. Shiqi

28:41.508 --> 28:42.660
really angry now

28:42.660 --> 28:45.016
Before one o'clock every morning,
he would wake up and practice swordsmanship.

28:45.016 --> 28:46.227
He forced us to practice together.

28:46.228 --> 28:48.067
We practice sword
and spear every day.

28:48.068 --> 28:49.148
If not,

28:49.228 --> 28:50.666
we will practice formation
at the army camp.

28:50.667 --> 28:52.148
We can't take it anymore.

28:53.508 --> 28:55.507
It's useless for you to tell me.

28:55.508 --> 28:56.987
I also

28:56.988 --> 28:58.067
no other way

28:58.068 --> 28:59.308
to persuade you again.

29:01.347 --> 29:02.106
This is how.

29:02.107 --> 29:02.987
The King of Qin ordered

29:02.988 --> 29:03.747
pretending to be sick

29:03.748 --> 29:04.547
With that,

29:04.548 --> 29:05.787
I can ask ma'am

29:05.788 --> 29:07.308
to visit the King of Qin.

29:08.347 --> 29:09.946
If King Qin
is willing to pretend to be sick,

29:09.947 --> 29:12.267
he wouldn't even wake up early
to practice swordsmanship every day.

29:15.068 --> 29:16.907
What should we do?

29:21.427 --> 29:22.720
Bao.

29:22.937 --> 29:24.329
Bao.

29:28.788 --> 29:29.586
How?

29:29.587 --> 29:31.148
What did the Taoist say?

29:31.387 --> 29:33.267
Taozi gives an idea.

29:33.268 --> 29:34.507
However,

29:34.548 --> 29:36.267
it doesn't feel right.

29:36.268 --> 29:38.586
If he refuses to pretend to be sick,

29:38.587 --> 29:39.507
let's

29:39.508 --> 29:41.588
let him get a little sick.

29:44.667 --> 29:45.827
Give this to him.

29:45.828 --> 29:47.227
He will get sick after eating it.

29:47.228 --> 29:48.866
At that time, I will tell you

29:48.867 --> 29:51.068
that the King of Qin fell ill
and told him to visit the King of Qin.

29:52.187 --> 29:53.507
This is not appropriate.

29:53.508 --> 29:55.027
What is not appropriate?

29:55.028 --> 29:56.707
I think it fits perfectly.

29:56.708 --> 29:57.307
Bao.

29:57.308 --> 29:58.346
Is Duo.

29:58.347 --> 29:59.547
You don't know

29:59.548 --> 30:01.227
that Mr. Shiqi brought me

30:01.228 --> 30:02.507
patrolling late at night.

30:02.508 --> 30:03.747
At one o'clock this morning,

30:03.748 --> 30:04.946
he surprised me

30:04.947 --> 30:06.586
and told me
to practice swordsmanship with him.

30:06.587 --> 30:07.547
I don't want to live

30:07.548 --> 30:09.307
in this way again.

30:09.308 --> 30:10.267
Don't you want to take medicine?

30:10.268 --> 30:11.067
I will take medicine.

30:11.068 --> 30:11.906
Bao.

30:11.907 --> 30:12.906
It can't be like this. If...

30:12.907 --> 30:14.067
If what?

30:14.068 --> 30:15.547
If he doesn't get sick again,

30:15.548 --> 30:16.946
i will go crazy

30:16.947 --> 30:18.426
It's better if he gets sick.

30:18.427 --> 30:20.267
If not, I will really go crazy.

30:20.867 --> 30:22.707
Bao.

30:39.068 --> 30:40.707
Place a sign.

30:41.667 --> 30:43.586
Those who are pinched have medicine.

30:43.587 --> 30:45.547
What is not pinched has no medicine.

30:45.548 --> 30:46.507
Those who are pinched have medicine.

30:46.508 --> 30:48.028
What is not pinched has no medicine.

30:49.187 --> 30:50.588
Tuan Shiqi.

30:50.867 --> 30:51.987
Tuan Shiqi.

30:51.988 --> 30:53.027
You've been practicing for a long time.

30:53.028 --> 30:54.146
You must be hungry.

30:54.147 --> 30:55.707
I had the kitchen make this.

30:55.708 --> 30:57.308
Eat it.

30:59.828 --> 31:01.507
Are kitchen people good at making snacks like this?

31:02.187 --> 31:03.307
Isn't Sun Jing's cook

31:03.308 --> 31:04.426
still alive?

31:04.427 --> 31:05.386
I told him to do it.

31:05.387 --> 31:06.707
Try the cuisine.

31:06.788 --> 31:08.227
Look at this snack.

31:08.508 --> 31:10.467
Very delicate and beautiful.

31:10.468 --> 31:11.548
Try it.

31:14.446 --> 31:15.819
Look.

31:17.308 --> 31:18.588
Delicious.

31:24.107 --> 31:25.344
Delicious.

31:27.028 --> 31:28.360
Delicious, isn't it?

31:28.788 --> 31:30.055
It's delicious.

31:37.387 --> 31:38.727
Delicious, isn't it?

32:03.268 --> 32:04.828
Why, Bao?

32:04.867 --> 32:06.227
Are you not well?

32:13.548 --> 32:15.227
Delicious.

32:15.947 --> 32:17.547
We are good friends.

32:17.548 --> 32:19.507
How dare you mistreat me.

32:22.907 --> 32:24.588
Bao.

32:24.988 --> 32:26.626
Poisoning?

32:26.627 --> 32:28.267
I used to be a counselor.

32:28.268 --> 32:29.426
How dare you add poison

32:29.427 --> 32:30.586
in front of me?

32:30.587 --> 32:32.307
You forced me

32:32.308 --> 32:34.027
wake up early and sleep late.

32:34.028 --> 32:35.866
We only practice swords and spears.

32:35.867 --> 32:37.507
How dare you change it

32:37.508 --> 32:40.028
and tell me to eat a snack
laced with poison?

32:41.107 --> 32:42.747
I want to break up with you.

32:42.748 --> 32:44.507
I want to break up with you!

32:56.947 --> 32:57.947
Young master.

32:58.107 --> 32:59.907
Really want to poison the lieutenant?

33:00.028 --> 33:00.666
Orang Jiesuo

33:00.667 --> 33:02.426
give us just one.

33:02.427 --> 33:04.426
He said, this is
the most valuable secret medicine for them.

33:04.427 --> 33:05.307
After taking this medicine,

33:05.308 --> 33:06.667
no signs of poisoning.

33:06.907 --> 33:08.920
People who eat it
seem to get seriously ill.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.688
Even the greatest healer
cannot know for sure.

33:11.147 --> 33:12.866
Without a cure,

33:12.867 --> 33:14.828
the person who eats it will die
after a few days.

33:16.708 --> 33:18.588
If Ying didn't have any problems,

33:18.867 --> 33:20.467
Li Ni will not be confused.

33:20.468 --> 33:21.787
If Li Ni is not confused,

33:21.788 --> 33:23.788
we can't kill Li Ni

33:24.347 --> 33:26.148
and couldn't kidnap Ying.

33:28.748 --> 33:29.828
Go away.

33:30.268 --> 33:31.667
Be careful.

33:32.468 --> 33:33.427
Of.

34:00.788 --> 34:02.507
Why, miss?

34:03.468 --> 34:04.742
Let me see.

34:05.867 --> 34:07.828
I have been uncomfortable since this morning.

34:09.907 --> 34:11.827
My head hurts now.

34:13.347 --> 34:14.307
It's hot.

34:14.308 --> 34:15.628
Must be a fever.

34:16.748 --> 34:18.000
So,

34:18.387 --> 34:19.908
I have a fever.

34:38.027 --> 34:39.066
Bao.

34:39.067 --> 34:40.066
Why are your skills backwards?

34:40.067 --> 34:41.606
I couldn't beat you
since before.

34:41.606 --> 34:42.187
After all,

34:42.188 --> 34:43.707
I have had diarrhea for several days.

34:43.708 --> 34:45.908
I have become weak.
You didn't even let me go.

34:49.387 --> 34:50.466
You...

34:50.467 --> 34:52.107
Did you really do that?

34:52.108 --> 34:52.546
You...

34:52.547 --> 34:54.908
Tuan Shiqi.

34:55.427 --> 34:56.346
What?

34:56.347 --> 34:57.386
Taozi has come.

34:57.387 --> 34:58.627
He said, there is an emergency.

34:58.628 --> 34:59.387
I don't want to see him.

34:59.588 --> 35:00.986
Mr. Shiqi, he has an emergency.

35:00.987 --> 35:02.187
What's the anxiety?

35:02.188 --> 35:03.466
If it's about the military,

35:03.467 --> 35:04.267
tell him to write a letter

35:04.268 --> 35:05.466
and send it to our army.

35:05.467 --> 35:06.866
As an ally, would the King of Qin want to

35:06.867 --> 35:08.264
ignore it?

35:08.265 --> 35:09.838
Let me go!

35:13.067 --> 35:14.026
King of Qin.

35:14.027 --> 35:15.148
Why?

35:15.788 --> 35:17.147
The lieutenant fell ill.

35:17.148 --> 35:18.628
The situation is bad.

35:19.027 --> 35:19.906
The lieutenant fell ill?

35:19.907 --> 35:20.747
Find a doctor.

35:20.748 --> 35:21.640
Why do you want to see me?

35:21.640 --> 35:23.006
Since childhood,
I checked the lieutenant's pulse.

35:23.006 --> 35:24.588
I understand his body condition.

35:24.628 --> 35:25.587
This time,

35:25.588 --> 35:27.147
the situation is strange.

35:27.148 --> 35:28.986
He suddenly had a high fever.

35:28.987 --> 35:30.747
I do acupuncture
and give medicine,

35:30.828 --> 35:32.707
but not effective.

35:32.828 --> 35:33.988
Today,

35:34.027 --> 35:35.026
lieutenant already

35:35.027 --> 35:36.347
is in a coma.

35:36.507 --> 35:37.426
Honourable.

35:37.427 --> 35:38.866
Hurry up to see him.

35:38.867 --> 35:40.026
I've never seen it

35:40.027 --> 35:41.588
this strange terrible disease.

35:42.347 --> 35:43.426
You can't even treat him,

35:43.427 --> 35:44.627
so you should find a doctor.

35:44.628 --> 35:45.667
You...

35:46.347 --> 35:48.426
King Qin's coldness.

35:48.427 --> 35:49.587
Anything,

35:49.588 --> 35:50.667
Cui Family Army

35:50.668 --> 35:52.346
is an ally of
the Zhenxi Army, right?

35:52.347 --> 35:53.827
Since we conspired,

35:53.828 --> 35:55.548
you shouldn't treat him
like this.

35:56.748 --> 35:58.187
You are cruel.

35:58.188 --> 35:59.108
Tuan Shiqi.

35:59.547 --> 36:00.548
Taozi.

36:00.867 --> 36:02.211
Taozi!

36:04.507 --> 36:05.707
You...

36:05.708 --> 36:07.508
Why are you so cruel?

36:10.188 --> 36:12.066
Don't pretend anymore.

36:12.067 --> 36:12.667
I know

36:12.668 --> 36:13.906
about your tricks

36:13.907 --> 36:15.466
You want to make me sick,

36:15.467 --> 36:16.627
but did not succeed.

36:16.628 --> 36:18.026
So, you made him fall ill,

36:18.027 --> 36:18.587
not?

36:18.588 --> 36:20.747
Nothing to do with me this time.

36:21.268 --> 36:22.468
I swear.

36:57.268 --> 36:58.747
(It's good to go see him.)

36:59.268 --> 37:00.908
(What if he really is sick?)

37:20.748 --> 37:23.107
How much.

37:23.108 --> 37:24.546
You must survive.

37:24.547 --> 37:26.587
I told people to ride fast horses

37:26.588 --> 37:27.946
to report to the commander in chief.

37:27.947 --> 37:28.426
So...

37:28.427 --> 37:30.428
He will arrive soon.

37:30.708 --> 37:32.428
Miss must survive.

37:46.947 --> 37:48.307
Tuan Shiqi.

37:48.547 --> 37:49.867
I'm outside.

37:56.788 --> 38:01.068
The moon is shining
and there are less stars tonight.

38:01.628 --> 38:02.747
Master Shiqi, let's go.

38:02.748 --> 38:04.068
Go on patrol.

38:04.708 --> 38:05.986
Aren't you busy talking?

38:05.987 --> 38:06.787
that you want to sleep?

38:06.788 --> 38:08.747
You find various excuses
so you don't have to patrol.

38:08.748 --> 38:09.466
Why?

38:09.467 --> 38:10.948
You are very proactive today.

38:11.628 --> 38:13.667
Tonight is not the same.

38:13.748 --> 38:15.986
I am energetic.

38:15.987 --> 38:17.627
Let me accompany you on patrol

38:17.628 --> 38:19.867
so you don't do anything else.

38:21.268 --> 38:22.908
What will I do?

38:24.467 --> 38:25.747
If you don't want to do anything,

38:25.748 --> 38:26.866
it's still good.

38:26.867 --> 38:28.387
Let's go.

38:29.588 --> 38:32.267
I will be with you
all night.

38:32.268 --> 38:33.988
Check the presence of soldiers at six in the morning.

38:35.228 --> 38:36.426
Let's go.

38:36.427 --> 38:37.747
Go away.

38:37.748 --> 38:38.787
Tonight,

38:38.788 --> 38:40.506
we will patrol

38:40.507 --> 38:42.827
in all corners.

38:47.188 --> 38:48.508
How much.

38:49.387 --> 38:50.628
How much.

38:51.790 --> 38:52.984
Taozi.

38:54.027 --> 38:55.667
Taozi, I have cooked medicine.

38:55.668 --> 38:56.627
I obey what you say

38:56.628 --> 38:57.627
to buy this medicine

38:57.628 --> 38:58.506
at a nearby drug store.

38:58.507 --> 39:00.587
Then, I sat in the kitchen
and cooked this medicine myself.

39:00.588 --> 39:01.948
The timing is right.

39:02.067 --> 39:02.906
How much.

39:02.907 --> 39:04.387
The medicine is ready, miss.

39:05.347 --> 39:06.588
Give me.

39:08.427 --> 39:10.387
Miss, the medicine is ready.

39:10.547 --> 39:11.988
Miss will be cured after eating it.

39:18.308 --> 39:19.107
How much.

39:19.108 --> 39:20.307
Miss, please.

39:20.308 --> 39:21.546
Open mouth.

39:21.547 --> 39:23.787
Miss will be cured after eating it.

39:27.867 --> 39:28.787
How much.

39:28.788 --> 39:30.466
I really have no other way.

39:30.467 --> 39:32.747
Please take medicine, miss.

39:43.268 --> 39:44.588
How much.

39:47.427 --> 39:48.187
Taozi.

39:48.188 --> 39:49.827
I will call Mr. Shiqi now.

39:49.867 --> 39:50.546
I will force him

39:50.547 --> 39:51.867
come this time.

39:51.987 --> 39:53.347
Do not go.

39:53.788 --> 39:55.466
He's a cold person.

39:55.467 --> 39:57.267
Why did you call him to come?

39:58.228 --> 39:59.187
So.

39:59.188 --> 39:59.986
Surely he didn't know

39:59.987 --> 40:01.147
that Lieutenant He's condition is dire.

40:01.148 --> 40:02.908
Mr. Shiqi is not that kind of person.

40:11.228 --> 40:12.707
Please let me take care of you here.

40:12.708 --> 40:14.147
I will command the whole army

40:14.148 --> 40:15.548
to increase alertness.

40:16.188 --> 40:17.866
He is very sick now.

40:17.867 --> 40:19.026
Can't let outsiders know

40:19.027 --> 40:19.866
and take a chance.

40:19.867 --> 40:20.945
Good.

40:22.268 --> 40:23.148
Oh yes.

40:23.387 --> 40:24.707
After I got home,

40:24.708 --> 40:26.068
you can go back first

40:26.108 --> 40:28.148
Otherwise, you will miss
the attendance check in the army.

40:28.308 --> 40:28.986
So.

40:28.987 --> 40:29.946
I am with you here.

40:29.947 --> 40:31.588
You are from the Zhenxi Army.

40:31.867 --> 40:33.426
If the commander-in-chief returns

40:33.427 --> 40:34.866
and see the condition of the lady,

40:34.867 --> 40:36.908
I'm worried that
he will kill you.

40:47.027 --> 40:48.354
Young master.

40:49.748 --> 40:51.034
How?

40:51.788 --> 40:53.468
King Qin hasn't come out yet.

40:57.067 --> 40:58.948
I don't think it's right.

40:59.467 --> 41:00.906
I didn't think Li Ni

41:00.907 --> 41:02.747
so cold.

41:04.148 --> 41:06.267
Ying looked at him wrongly.

41:07.148 --> 41:08.440
Young master.

41:08.668 --> 41:10.548
The lieutenant had been poisoned
for three days.

41:10.987 --> 41:12.667
If he doesn't take the antidote tonight,

41:12.668 --> 41:13.946
his life will be affected

41:13.947 --> 41:15.508
even if he eats the cure
in the morning.

41:20.268 --> 41:21.628
Wait again.

41:32.205 --> 41:33.346
Tuan Shiqi.

41:33.347 --> 41:34.426
Do not go.

41:34.427 --> 41:35.747
It's only one o'clock in the morning.

41:35.748 --> 41:37.426
What are you doing back?

41:37.427 --> 41:39.546
We have patrolled all the places.
Why do you want to stay here?

41:39.547 --> 41:40.667
Patrolling again.

41:40.668 --> 41:41.627
Didn't we promise?

41:41.628 --> 41:42.946
I will accompany you until the morning.

41:42.947 --> 41:43.827
I have something else.

41:43.828 --> 41:45.307
What thing?

41:47.027 --> 41:48.066
I haven't read the letter

41:48.067 --> 41:49.307
sent from the capital.

41:50.268 --> 41:51.906
You can read it tomorrow.

41:51.907 --> 41:53.147
It is not an emergency letter.

41:53.148 --> 41:54.227
I want to sleep.

41:55.067 --> 41:58.107
How did you scold me
a few nights ago?

41:58.108 --> 41:59.267
Not tired.

41:59.427 --> 42:01.187
We are not sleepy.

42:01.668 --> 42:03.747
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

42:05.907 --> 42:07.587
You are right.

42:07.588 --> 42:09.307
I'm deliberately.

42:09.308 --> 42:10.787
Good. Let's continue.

42:10.788 --> 42:11.346
Proceed.

42:11.347 --> 42:12.320
- Go away.
- Go away.

42:12.320 --> 42:12.827
Go away.

42:17.188 --> 42:18.747
You can't stop me, can you?

42:28.387 --> 42:30.347
Young master, it's almost dawn.

42:31.188 --> 42:33.068
I don't think it's right.

42:33.588 --> 42:35.827
Ying is really smart,

42:37.108 --> 42:39.148
but he trusted the wrong person.

42:39.347 --> 42:41.667
Tonight, the Cui Family Army
has increased vigilance.

42:42.108 --> 42:43.627
If we wait until dawn,

42:43.628 --> 42:45.426
it's hard for me to enter.

42:45.427 --> 42:46.147
This is the cure.

42:46.148 --> 42:47.108
Go away.

42:47.228 --> 42:49.227
Let Ying take the medicine first.

42:49.547 --> 42:50.875
Of.

43:02.788 --> 43:04.289
Taozi.

43:09.387 --> 43:11.028
Why did King Qin come?

43:11.148 --> 43:12.227
Is your lieutenant

43:12.228 --> 43:13.506
did you fall sick?

43:13.507 --> 43:15.066
Only healthy lieutenant.

43:15.067 --> 43:16.267
No need to worry, your honor.

43:16.268 --> 43:17.747
Is he really sick?

43:17.748 --> 43:19.187
No lah.

43:20.427 --> 43:21.707
Your Highness, please keep your temper.

43:21.708 --> 43:23.307
This is the Cui Family Army camp.

43:23.308 --> 43:24.787
If the noble continues to do this,

43:24.788 --> 43:25.747
I will tell people

43:25.748 --> 43:26.827
drive away the noble.

43:28.148 --> 43:29.346
Taozi.

43:29.347 --> 43:30.827
Who are you talking to outside?

43:30.828 --> 43:31.867
How much.

43:32.748 --> 43:33.707
How much.

43:33.708 --> 43:34.908
Slowly.

43:35.507 --> 43:36.578
Mari.

43:38.467 --> 43:39.628
Let me see.

43:41.987 --> 43:43.428
I am fine.

43:46.188 --> 43:47.908
You must be worried.

43:48.467 --> 43:50.428
I am really worried.

43:54.628 --> 43:55.860
Ying.

43:56.867 --> 43:58.307
You did get sick.

44:00.708 --> 44:01.906
Which one hurts?

44:01.907 --> 44:03.347
are you ok now

44:06.947 --> 44:08.707
King Qin, don't be like that.

44:09.628 --> 44:11.187
It's just a mild illness.

44:12.507 --> 44:14.267
No need to worry.

44:18.067 --> 44:19.328
Taozi.

44:21.347 --> 44:22.988
You're out for a second.

44:23.108 --> 44:24.628
I want to talk

44:25.108 --> 44:26.506
with the King of Qin.

44:26.507 --> 44:27.627
How much.

44:27.628 --> 44:28.906
You just woke up.

44:28.907 --> 44:30.428
Let me accompany you here.

44:31.228 --> 44:33.267
It's ok. Do not worry.

44:34.828 --> 44:36.125
Go away.

44:52.268 --> 44:53.516
Ying.

45:00.148 --> 45:02.548
You hate me
because I cheated on you.

45:04.027 --> 45:05.548
These several days,

45:06.347 --> 45:08.148
I also think a lot.

45:09.828 --> 45:11.827
Even if this happens again,

45:12.467 --> 45:14.187
I will still do that.

45:15.987 --> 45:18.108
I don't regret it.

45:20.027 --> 45:21.628
Because I think

45:21.987 --> 45:23.707
whether he is the great-grandson of the real majesty

45:23.708 --> 45:25.307
or a fake one,

45:27.788 --> 45:30.347
It's not worth it
for you to sacrifice for him.

45:33.708 --> 45:35.108
You are sick now.

45:35.228 --> 45:36.948
Do not discuss this again.

45:41.427 --> 45:42.747
When I have a fever

45:42.748 --> 45:44.588
and didn't realize a few days before,

45:46.067 --> 45:48.548
I hope that you
can come visit me.

45:50.507 --> 45:52.428
When someone gets sick,

45:52.867 --> 45:54.628
he will become weak.

45:56.987 --> 45:58.787
My mother died
when I was little.

45:59.668 --> 46:01.948
I have less family members too.

46:03.947 --> 46:05.948
Now, besides dad,

46:08.867 --> 46:10.948
you are the closest to me.

46:14.067 --> 46:15.867
At that time, I thought

46:16.387 --> 46:18.588
that if you come to see me,

46:19.108 --> 46:20.667
then it proves that

46:21.788 --> 46:23.548
you care more about me

46:24.987 --> 46:27.187
from other things

46:27.188 --> 46:30.108
and others.

46:31.788 --> 46:33.187
If you come,

46:33.188 --> 46:34.587
I can explain

46:34.588 --> 46:35.906
that's up to you

46:35.907 --> 46:37.628
even if I'm angry.

46:37.867 --> 46:39.346
With this, you can too

46:39.347 --> 46:41.548
understand my feelings next time.

46:47.987 --> 46:49.548
However, you did not come.

46:51.788 --> 46:53.139
I know

46:54.427 --> 46:56.227
that you still scold me

46:56.308 --> 46:57.867
I'm not scolding you.

46:59.947 --> 47:01.307
In my heart,

47:02.228 --> 47:04.468
you are more important than anyone else.

47:07.108 --> 47:08.506
Honourable,

47:08.507 --> 47:10.187
don't fool me again

47:15.733 --> 47:17.026
I also want to tell you something

47:17.027 --> 47:18.347
honestly.

47:20.907 --> 47:22.347
I want to tell you

47:23.387 --> 47:24.787
that I don't care

47:24.788 --> 47:26.227
title of King of Qin

47:26.507 --> 47:27.906
or the commander in chief.

47:27.907 --> 47:30.587
I just want to finish
Concubine Xiao's order.

47:30.588 --> 47:32.466
Then,
I want to go back to Laolan Border

47:32.467 --> 47:34.187
with you

47:34.588 --> 47:36.387
We can enjoy the sky there.

47:39.268 --> 47:40.628
Shiqi.

47:41.027 --> 47:43.148
You can't go back.

47:43.907 --> 47:45.147
your father

47:45.148 --> 47:47.108
is the current emperor.

47:47.268 --> 47:49.707
Sun Jing is dead,
the situation is decided.

47:49.708 --> 47:51.227
Both your brothers

47:51.228 --> 47:53.227
just like a wild animal.

47:53.268 --> 47:54.707
Do you want to submit?

47:54.708 --> 47:56.466
our country to them?

47:56.467 --> 47:57.667
I have said.

47:58.308 --> 48:00.108
After I saved his great-grandson,

48:00.547 --> 48:01.840
I will persuade him

48:01.840 --> 48:03.627
to appoint his great-grandson
as crown prince.

48:03.628 --> 48:05.506
How old is his great-grandson this year?

48:05.507 --> 48:07.026
His great-grandson is still young.

48:07.027 --> 48:09.026
How are his qualifications and talents?

48:09.027 --> 48:10.227
If he becomes a talentless person

48:10.228 --> 48:11.426
after he grew up,

48:11.427 --> 48:13.346
how does he want to lead the country?

48:13.347 --> 48:15.107
His great-grandson is a legitimate descendant.

48:15.108 --> 48:16.867
He should inherit the throne.

48:17.628 --> 48:19.347
After all, he is talented.

48:19.547 --> 48:21.347
There are many more dignitaries

48:21.467 --> 48:22.787
will help him.

48:22.788 --> 48:24.428
He will succeed.

48:24.867 --> 48:26.667
Are both your brothers

48:26.668 --> 48:28.787
will let his great-grandson
live to adulthood?

48:28.788 --> 48:30.387
Anything,

48:30.668 --> 48:31.426
you feel that

48:31.427 --> 48:32.787
I have to compete for this throne.

48:32.788 --> 48:33.908
That's right.

48:34.907 --> 48:36.506
Because I think you are the most suitable

48:36.507 --> 48:38.667
to lead this country.

48:40.547 --> 48:43.468
You are generous and care
about this country.

48:43.867 --> 48:45.548
You have compassion for the people.

48:45.767 --> 48:47.360
You have
great military achievements

48:47.360 --> 48:48.428
and great in controlling the army.

48:48.507 --> 48:50.466
You restored the kingdom

48:50.467 --> 48:52.787
and put down the rebellion.

48:52.788 --> 48:54.267
If you are appointed
crown prince,

48:54.268 --> 48:55.187
magnifier in the balirung draw

48:55.188 --> 48:56.627
will not object.

48:56.628 --> 48:57.946
Without a dispute in the draw,

48:57.947 --> 48:59.908
people can live happily.

49:01.347 --> 49:02.667
Shiqi.

49:02.828 --> 49:03.627
You will be

49:03.628 --> 49:05.548
good and responsible emperor.

49:05.708 --> 49:08.026
If you become emperor,

49:08.027 --> 49:09.906
this country will be peaceful and prosperous

49:09.907 --> 49:11.908
for decades to come.

49:14.058 --> 49:15.823
Everyone
has their own ambitions.

49:16.947 --> 49:18.827
There are people who want
to control the whole country,

49:21.427 --> 49:23.787
but I just want to keep my promise.

49:25.268 --> 49:26.867
When the situation stabilizes,

49:27.148 --> 49:28.948
I want to protect

49:29.748 --> 49:31.946
Laolan border with you.

49:31.947 --> 49:32.827
What if I

49:32.828 --> 49:34.757
refused to follow you
to the Laolan Border?
