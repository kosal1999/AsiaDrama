=Episode 26=

01:43.268 --> 01:43.947
Shiqi.

01:44.160 --> 01:46.808
Through my secret investigation,
I didn't notice anything strange

01:46.928 --> 01:48.008
in Lord Xin's Residence.

01:48.209 --> 01:49.849
The usage of vegetable oil, sesame oil,

01:49.969 --> 01:51.288
firewood and coal

01:51.448 --> 01:53.168
doesn't differ much
from the usual usage.

01:53.329 --> 01:54.969
I also checked Lord Xin's account

01:55.129 --> 01:56.329
with the oil and coal suppliers

01:56.448 --> 01:57.928
in previous years

01:58.008 --> 02:00.209
and compared it
with the kitchen and woodshed.

02:00.329 --> 02:01.368
Everything seems normal.

02:03.969 --> 02:05.969
If there was no fuel for combustion,

02:06.728 --> 02:07.969
why would the fire be so strong?

02:08.769 --> 02:09.968
This is so strange.

02:10.088 --> 02:10.729
Exactly.

02:10.920 --> 02:12.590
I also investigated
the servants in the residence.

02:12.609 --> 02:13.289
However,

02:13.489 --> 02:15.169
I still didn't find any clue.

02:17.688 --> 02:19.088
Shiqi.

02:20.049 --> 02:22.289
See what Wan'niang brought you.

02:24.088 --> 02:25.928
Nanny, why are you here?

02:26.169 --> 02:27.729
Next time, send someone to inform me.

02:27.848 --> 02:28.648
I'll go over.

02:30.088 --> 02:31.169
It's just a short distance.

02:31.289 --> 02:32.408
I can still walk.

02:33.609 --> 02:35.848
Wan'niang purposely
went to Xiangji Temple

02:35.968 --> 02:37.368
and requested the Heart Sutra

02:37.449 --> 02:39.368
which the abbot copied by hand.

02:39.968 --> 02:40.769
It is believed

02:40.889 --> 02:43.009
that offering the Heart Sutra
before ancestral tablets

02:43.128 --> 02:45.009
is the best way to accumulate blessings

02:45.128 --> 02:46.209
and eliminate karma.

02:46.609 --> 02:48.049
We are here to give it to you

02:48.169 --> 02:50.410
so that you can offer it
in front of Madam Liu's tablet.

02:56.408 --> 02:56.808
Thank you.

03:02.440 --> 03:07.081
(Heart Sutra)

03:26.009 --> 03:26.729
Nanny.

03:27.088 --> 03:28.088
Let me put it for you.

03:28.329 --> 03:29.889
Beware of the fire.

03:39.528 --> 03:40.329
What happened?

03:40.330 --> 03:41.688
I wasn't paying attention just now.

03:41.688 --> 03:43.540
I accidentally burnt a hole
in the embroidered portrait.

03:43.569 --> 03:44.609
What should I do?

03:44.928 --> 03:46.368
This is all my fault.

03:47.209 --> 03:47.810
It's all right.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.489
It's just a tiny hole.

03:49.928 --> 03:51.729
Miss Gu, you don't
have to blame yourself.

03:52.009 --> 03:53.688
However, this is Madam Liu's portrait.

03:53.700 --> 03:55.140
It's all my fault for being careless.

03:55.848 --> 03:56.569
Miss.

03:56.688 --> 03:58.368
Since you burnt
a hole in the embroidery,

03:58.528 --> 03:59.928
why don't you fix it?

04:00.120 --> 04:01.648
You are such a nimble-fingered person.

04:01.769 --> 04:03.049
Last time, I accidentally dirtied

04:03.169 --> 04:04.528
the white silk fan.

04:04.688 --> 04:06.609
Then, you embroidered a butterfly on it.

04:06.808 --> 04:08.128
It was so exquisite.

04:08.270 --> 04:09.609
The stain couldn't be seen at all.

04:09.848 --> 04:10.528
Your Highness,

04:10.600 --> 04:12.329
please allow me
to take the portrait down

04:12.449 --> 04:13.848
and fix the embroidery.

04:14.688 --> 04:15.769
Shiqi,

04:16.249 --> 04:17.968
hurry up and take it down.

04:18.369 --> 04:20.848
Let Wan'niang embroider it here.

04:26.449 --> 04:28.488
Miss Gu, sorry to have troubled you.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.488
Your Highness, why did you say so?

04:30.728 --> 04:33.088
I'm just mending what I've done.

04:50.569 --> 04:51.449
Your Highness.

04:54.889 --> 04:56.728
General Han, it's time
to take your medicine.

04:58.320 --> 04:59.329
Thank you, Your Highness.

05:08.488 --> 05:09.929
Is your injury

05:10.048 --> 05:10.968
getting better?

05:11.168 --> 05:12.010
It's a lot better now.

05:13.209 --> 05:13.929
To be honest,

05:15.968 --> 05:17.769
from the moment I rescued Your Highness,

05:18.449 --> 05:19.968
I felt my injury

05:20.528 --> 05:21.889
was not serious at all.

05:23.968 --> 05:25.009
I also didn't expect

05:25.129 --> 05:26.608
that I would see you again.

05:26.848 --> 05:27.288
When I was

05:27.369 --> 05:29.209
taken captive by Sun Jing,

05:29.329 --> 05:30.129
I thought

05:30.249 --> 05:32.168
I must die with integrity
if I really had to.

05:32.288 --> 05:32.689
I must not

05:32.848 --> 05:34.488
bring disgrace to the Li's family.

05:34.809 --> 05:36.689
I never thought that I would be rescued.

05:42.920 --> 05:44.720
After we have rescued you,

05:45.528 --> 05:46.889
we were in a hopeless dilemma.

05:48.088 --> 05:49.569
Fortunately, Lord Qin's subordinates

05:49.569 --> 05:52.088
found us and informed Consort Xiao.

05:52.369 --> 05:55.689
Her Highness allowed us
to stay here for a few days.

05:56.260 --> 05:58.048
The situation
in the capital is complicated.

05:59.168 --> 06:01.569
The Cui family relied
on their military power

06:02.408 --> 06:04.528
just like how Sun Jing used to be.

06:05.048 --> 06:08.449
Although His Majesty is your uncle,

06:08.929 --> 06:11.408
there are also people
with vile characters around him.

06:12.088 --> 06:14.648
Lord Xin and Lord Qi

06:15.168 --> 06:17.168
are the current emperor's own sons.

06:17.889 --> 06:20.009
How they would see you

06:23.329 --> 06:25.048
is still unclear.

06:35.848 --> 06:40.608
Humans are born intrinsically
with a good and similar nature.

06:40.809 --> 06:46.009
However, their natures
will change based on what they learn.

06:46.209 --> 06:51.249
If a child does not receive proper
education, his good nature will change.

06:51.488 --> 06:56.449
The way to educate a child well is
through total commitment and devotion.

06:56.648 --> 07:01.929
Mencius' mother shifted three times to
find the best place to bring up her son.

07:02.129 --> 07:05.048
Once Mencius was absent from school,
she cut the cloth she was knitting.

07:05.209 --> 07:07.608
Have you got used to living here?

07:08.728 --> 07:09.889
In the private school,

07:10.449 --> 07:12.209
many children are coming in and out.

07:13.689 --> 07:15.329
The fact that we are hiding here

07:15.569 --> 07:17.009
won't be noticeable.

07:17.369 --> 07:18.488
This place is good.

07:18.520 --> 07:20.270
When I heard the sound
of reading yesterday,

07:20.288 --> 07:21.569
I felt at ease.

07:21.769 --> 07:23.369
I've been hearing about private schools.

07:23.528 --> 07:25.288
Now that I'm here,

07:25.290 --> 07:27.190
I finally know
what a private school looks like.

07:27.249 --> 07:29.009
It is good that Your Highness

07:29.569 --> 07:30.689
likes studying.

07:32.048 --> 07:34.209
I want to study more
and learn more skills

07:34.569 --> 07:35.968
so that my mother will feel happy

07:36.088 --> 07:37.449
when she sees me.

07:37.608 --> 07:38.968
I've grown taller.

07:39.129 --> 07:41.809
I've also learned more knowledge
compared to the past.

07:56.920 --> 07:58.369
It's all my fault for being careless.

07:58.848 --> 08:00.809
This type of silk is highly flammable.

08:01.160 --> 08:03.929
Just a short contact
with the incense stick could cause a hole.

08:04.420 --> 08:06.288
Even the golden threads
beneath were damaged.

08:06.848 --> 08:10.168
Authentic golden threads like this
would shrink to small beads

08:10.569 --> 08:11.889
when they are burnt and broken.

08:12.329 --> 08:13.488
They are not like silk threads

08:13.608 --> 08:14.728
that can be connected again.

08:14.870 --> 08:17.180
The entire thread has to
be removed to redo the embroidery.

08:17.320 --> 08:19.610
No wonder you asked me to
get this type of golden thread.

08:20.449 --> 08:23.088
I didn't know a small bundle like this
could weigh this much.

08:23.320 --> 08:25.380
The golden threads taken from
the Department of Clothing

08:25.408 --> 08:27.009
have premium quality.

08:27.129 --> 08:28.648
That is why they weigh so much.

08:29.249 --> 08:30.408
Speaking of this,

08:30.528 --> 08:32.608
a few years ago, the late emperor

08:32.640 --> 08:34.960
banned the commoners from
doing embroidery using golden threads.

08:35.209 --> 08:36.809
Everyone didn't dare to break the law.

08:37.128 --> 08:37.848
Hence, they pasted

08:38.008 --> 08:38.929
gold foil

08:39.088 --> 08:40.329
on the silk.

08:40.330 --> 08:42.470
These are not considered
embroidery using golden threads.

08:42.488 --> 08:43.710
Instead, these are gilded clothes,

08:43.728 --> 08:44.929
so, it wasn't against the law.

08:45.329 --> 08:47.848
In recent years, it has been
quite popular in the capital.

08:55.449 --> 08:56.128
Your Highness.

08:58.209 --> 08:59.289
You said

09:00.169 --> 09:01.728
this type of silk is highly flammable.

09:02.569 --> 09:03.449
Yes.

09:04.409 --> 09:05.968
If a lot of such silk were put together,

09:06.128 --> 09:06.888
wouldn't they be

09:07.449 --> 09:08.329
as flammable

09:08.608 --> 09:10.289
as the oil chamber?

09:11.128 --> 09:11.888
Of course.

09:12.520 --> 09:15.289
I heard that at silk fabric shops
in the capital, there are high walls

09:15.449 --> 09:17.768
and large tanks filled with water
outside the storeroom

09:18.120 --> 09:20.100
just in case their neighboring shops
catch fire.

09:20.169 --> 09:21.630
Otherwise, everything would be burned

09:21.649 --> 09:22.929
and nothing could be retrieved.

09:28.689 --> 09:30.728
Your Highness, are you all right?

09:31.409 --> 09:32.569
Just now, you also said

09:34.470 --> 09:36.608
that people in the capital
usually wear gilded clothes

09:37.569 --> 09:39.180
and they paste gold foils on the fabric.

09:39.649 --> 09:40.209
Yes.

09:40.529 --> 09:42.649
Although it's only a thin film,

09:42.720 --> 09:44.809
having it on the clothes
gives it a brilliant look.

09:45.008 --> 09:46.209
It looks really nice.

09:48.008 --> 09:50.728
When a real golden thread catches fire,

09:51.608 --> 09:53.128
it shrinks to a small size.

09:53.620 --> 09:54.790
When a real gold film catches fire,

09:54.809 --> 09:55.809
the same happens.

09:56.248 --> 09:58.649
Your Highness, what are you thinking?

10:00.128 --> 10:00.809
Nothing.

10:01.929 --> 10:02.569
Miss Gu.

10:02.888 --> 10:04.529
I just remembered that I need to

10:04.600 --> 10:06.008
tell Pei Yuan something important.

10:06.689 --> 10:07.488
Please excuse me.

10:27.248 --> 10:28.248
Shiqi.

10:28.649 --> 10:30.008
Why are there some golden beads

10:30.169 --> 10:33.248
in the soil taken from the backyard
of Lord Xin's Residence?

10:34.209 --> 10:35.088
Go and check

10:35.768 --> 10:38.289
whether the people
in Lord Xin's Residence

10:38.449 --> 10:39.968
bought gilded silk in bulk recently.

10:40.329 --> 10:41.569
Gilded silk?

10:42.128 --> 10:42.569
Also,

10:44.449 --> 10:46.049
investigate the confidants

10:46.368 --> 10:47.608
of Lord Xin.

10:48.209 --> 10:50.488
Check whether they
have also purchased gilded silk.

10:51.329 --> 10:51.809
All right.

11:05.529 --> 11:06.128
Young Master.

11:07.720 --> 11:08.860
A news from the secret agent.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.710
Lieutenant He, with only a troop of men,

11:11.120 --> 11:12.410
is coming in Xichang's direction.

11:13.820 --> 11:15.000
Is she coming to the capital?

11:15.420 --> 11:16.600
She doesn't look like she plans to.

11:16.649 --> 11:17.640
They are moving quite slowly.

11:18.608 --> 11:19.608
It's as if she's waiting

11:20.649 --> 11:21.449
for someone.

11:23.049 --> 11:24.728
She's probably waiting for Li Ni.

11:26.488 --> 11:27.809
Her infatuation for Li Ni

11:29.049 --> 11:30.809
will most probably be left unanswered.

11:31.809 --> 11:34.569
Li Ni is such a pedantic person.

11:35.248 --> 11:36.209
At this point,

11:36.329 --> 11:37.929
he still doesn't dare to tell Ying

11:38.488 --> 11:39.689
that he wants to marry her.

11:40.848 --> 11:43.209
As for Lord Xin and Lord Qi,

11:43.689 --> 11:45.409
who do they think they are?

11:45.848 --> 11:47.728
How dare they imagine marrying Ying?

11:49.449 --> 11:50.128
Young Master.

11:51.049 --> 11:52.649
Shall we give them a lesson?

11:54.329 --> 11:55.810
There's no need to give the game away.

11:56.288 --> 11:56.929
Yes.

11:58.649 --> 12:00.569
It's good that Ying is coming out

12:01.049 --> 12:02.248
from Luoyang.

12:03.248 --> 12:05.289
At least she's no longer
with the Cui Army.

12:06.169 --> 12:06.809
Otherwise,

12:08.320 --> 12:10.360
it will be difficult for us
to get in on the ground.

12:11.968 --> 12:14.128
I have sent people
to follow Lieutenant He secretly.

12:14.569 --> 12:16.088
Pick a good time

12:16.409 --> 12:18.169
and set up the maze secretly.

12:18.929 --> 12:22.008
Do not let Cui Yi realise.

12:22.289 --> 12:22.809
Understand.

12:24.968 --> 12:26.368
Everything is clear now.

12:27.289 --> 12:29.488
Indeed, Lord Xin
wanted to harm Consort Xin.

12:29.620 --> 12:31.230
He ordered people
to send numerous gilded silk

12:31.248 --> 12:34.049
to Consort Xin's room
for the reason of making clothes.

12:34.209 --> 12:34.970
Then, fire was set.

12:35.220 --> 12:36.768
Furthermore, on the night of the fire,

12:36.770 --> 12:38.670
they also delayed
the rescue process on purpose.

12:39.049 --> 12:40.649
One of them admitted that

12:40.848 --> 12:41.488
they drugged

12:41.608 --> 12:43.008
the food for Consort Xin

12:43.169 --> 12:44.248
and her servants.

12:44.569 --> 12:45.409
Therefore,

12:45.529 --> 12:46.848
none of them woke up that night.

12:47.289 --> 12:49.368
All of them were burned to death.

12:50.209 --> 12:51.169
Li Jun!

12:51.968 --> 12:53.128
Li Jun!

12:55.569 --> 12:57.289
How could he be so vicious?

12:59.608 --> 13:01.649
How could he be so vicious?

13:05.809 --> 13:07.649
Consort Xin was married
to him for many years.

13:08.650 --> 13:10.510
They had been through
difficult times together.

13:10.888 --> 13:11.968
Now, we have

13:12.008 --> 13:13.649
witnesses, material evidence,

13:13.768 --> 13:14.449
and statements,

13:14.640 --> 13:16.110
but we still need to
identify the witness

13:16.248 --> 13:17.529
who knows about the drugging.

13:18.209 --> 13:20.768
Lord Xin is indeed disappointing.

13:23.409 --> 13:24.728
Shiqi.

13:25.049 --> 13:27.008
Do you really plan to report him

13:27.368 --> 13:28.368
in front of His Majesty?

13:30.128 --> 13:31.608
Ever since Consort Dong passed away,

13:34.128 --> 13:36.649
only Consort Xin cared for me.

13:38.569 --> 13:40.248
She died so unjustly.

13:41.968 --> 13:44.128
I must seek justice for her

13:45.049 --> 13:46.608
in front of His Majesty.

13:49.929 --> 13:53.888
- Long Live Your Majesty!
- Long Live Your Majesty!

13:54.248 --> 13:55.488
Please rise.

13:56.088 --> 13:58.409
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

14:02.128 --> 14:03.209
Where is Lord Qin?

14:07.008 --> 14:07.768
Your Majesty,

14:07.888 --> 14:09.768
Lord Qin said he had
urgent military affairs.

14:09.929 --> 14:11.289
He left the capital
early in the morning,

14:11.290 --> 14:12.810
so he could not make it
to the morning meeting.

14:12.820 --> 14:15.049
He asked me to request
a day's leave from Your Majesty.

14:17.128 --> 14:19.289
He always claims to have
military affairs to handle,

14:19.888 --> 14:21.449
as if he is the only

14:21.608 --> 14:23.049
busy person.

14:28.488 --> 14:29.209
Your Majesty.

14:29.329 --> 14:30.329
Cui Yi submits a letter

14:30.449 --> 14:32.910
stating that he is willing
to marry his daughter to the prince.

14:33.008 --> 14:33.929
I think

14:34.049 --> 14:36.608
this matter should be
confirmed as soon as possible.

14:38.768 --> 14:42.329
It's not good to ask Cui Yi

14:42.728 --> 14:44.488
whether he wants to

14:44.649 --> 14:45.768
marry his daughter

14:45.929 --> 14:47.209
to Lord Qi or Lord Qin.

14:48.329 --> 14:50.248
Your Majesty,
since Lord Xin is a new widower,

14:50.409 --> 14:53.289
he could marry Miss Cui as well.

14:55.169 --> 14:56.888
You have a point.

14:58.368 --> 14:59.169
Your Majesty.

14:59.449 --> 15:00.888
Consort Xin has just passed away

15:01.049 --> 15:01.929
not long ago.

15:02.809 --> 15:05.968
I do not have the intention to remarry.

15:09.929 --> 15:11.768
Lord Xin

15:12.409 --> 15:15.049
is indeed a man
with affection and loyalty.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.280
Why would a man
with affection and loyalty

15:20.689 --> 15:22.248
plot a murder against his own wife

15:22.248 --> 15:23.600
and do something extremely tragic?

15:35.689 --> 15:36.329
Your Majesty.

15:36.888 --> 15:38.449
Lord Xin first drugged

15:38.728 --> 15:40.449
Consort Xin and her servants.

15:40.620 --> 15:43.008
Then, he placed bundles of silk
that are highly flammable in her room

15:43.120 --> 15:44.980
and set the room on fire,
making it like an accident.

15:45.169 --> 15:46.689
This caused the death of Consort Xin

15:46.780 --> 15:47.848
and everyone staying there.

15:49.649 --> 15:50.888
This is an unfounded accusation!

15:51.449 --> 15:54.128
Li Ni! What are you talking about?

15:54.368 --> 15:54.929
Your Majesty.

15:55.169 --> 15:56.929
I have all the witnesses and evidence.

15:57.120 --> 15:59.810
I left the capital early in the morning
to investigate this matter.

16:00.368 --> 16:01.728
The person who sent the silk

16:01.730 --> 16:03.310
and Lord Xin's confidants
who did the drugging

16:03.409 --> 16:04.529
have been captured by me.

16:04.689 --> 16:07.410
The testimony of the confidants
of Lord Xin as well as the evidence

16:07.649 --> 16:09.169
have been sent to Dali Temple.

16:11.929 --> 16:12.649
Your Majesty.

16:12.920 --> 16:14.409
He is making an unfounded accusation!

16:14.529 --> 16:15.449
I didn't do it!

16:15.608 --> 16:17.728
I really didn't do any of these!

16:17.929 --> 16:20.329
Father, please seek justice for me!

16:21.088 --> 16:21.689
Those witnesses

16:21.809 --> 16:23.169
are all serving in your residence.

16:23.370 --> 16:25.010
Many of them
were assigned by His Majesty

16:25.020 --> 16:26.510
and have been with you
since you were young.

16:34.569 --> 16:35.569
Jun.

16:36.169 --> 16:37.449
Jun!

16:37.728 --> 16:39.128
Father!

16:39.169 --> 16:40.049
I really didn't do it!

16:40.050 --> 16:41.809
Why did you do such actions?

16:42.008 --> 16:42.888
Why?

16:43.008 --> 16:44.409
Someone set me up!

16:44.569 --> 16:45.329
Father!

16:45.929 --> 16:47.449
Please seek justice for me!

16:47.649 --> 16:48.728
Consort Xin

16:49.199 --> 16:51.559
was such a good child with filial piety!

16:51.728 --> 16:53.768
Someone set me up!

16:53.929 --> 16:54.449
Father!

16:55.008 --> 16:56.728
Please seek justice for me!

16:56.820 --> 16:57.100
Father!

16:57.100 --> 16:59.110
Do you think he could bribe
so many people to set you up?

16:59.169 --> 17:00.128
Most of them

17:00.209 --> 17:01.488
are even your confidants!

17:01.608 --> 17:03.248
Do you think I'm stupid?

17:14.328 --> 17:15.089
Your Majesty.

17:15.248 --> 17:17.248
Lord Xin's action of
murdering his own wife

17:17.328 --> 17:19.169
is totally against humanity.

17:19.288 --> 17:20.968
Please give him a serious punishment.

17:21.048 --> 17:21.409
Father.

17:21.420 --> 17:24.070
- Please give him a serious punishment.
- Please give him a serious punishment.

17:26.089 --> 17:26.889
Father.

17:28.409 --> 17:29.409
Father.

17:29.889 --> 17:30.929
Father.

17:31.808 --> 17:32.889
Father.

17:33.488 --> 17:34.288
Father.

17:38.129 --> 17:40.129
Take this disobedient son out.

17:41.649 --> 17:43.129
Lock him up in his residence.

17:43.209 --> 17:45.209
He shall not leave the residence.

17:46.169 --> 17:48.008
Let him chant sutras

17:48.488 --> 17:51.568
and pray for Consort Xin every day

17:52.449 --> 17:55.568
to eliminate his karma.

17:55.728 --> 17:59.008
Father!

17:59.129 --> 18:00.169
I didn't do it!

18:00.248 --> 18:00.929
I didn't!

18:01.008 --> 18:02.048
Please seek justice for me!

18:02.169 --> 18:03.328
I really didn't do it!

18:03.409 --> 18:04.568
Fa... Father!

18:04.728 --> 18:06.889
Father!

18:07.129 --> 18:09.369
Father! I really didn't do it!

18:10.488 --> 18:11.728
I didn't!

18:11.808 --> 18:13.689
Please seek justice for me!

18:13.808 --> 18:16.929
Father! I really didn't do it!

18:18.048 --> 18:20.288
Father!

18:26.520 --> 18:28.480
One day of married life
breeds days of enduring affection.

18:28.649 --> 18:29.968
I never thought that Li Jun

18:30.728 --> 18:32.248
would murder his wife.

18:34.250 --> 18:37.070
Fights between husband and wife
and fights between brothers for property

18:37.089 --> 18:39.169
are not uncommon in my hometown.

18:39.689 --> 18:41.488
I didn't expect that
someone in the capital

18:41.768 --> 18:43.129
would murder

18:43.248 --> 18:44.248
his own wife

18:44.328 --> 18:45.728
to fight for power and position.

18:45.808 --> 18:47.528
How inhuman!

18:48.808 --> 18:50.209
When Consort Xin first got married,

18:50.689 --> 18:52.768
I was the most unwelcome person
in the residence.

18:53.120 --> 18:54.870
She knew that I lost
my mother since young,

18:54.889 --> 18:56.048
so she always treated me well.

18:56.849 --> 18:58.768
How could Li Jun

18:59.209 --> 19:00.808
kill a kind person like her?

19:02.728 --> 19:04.568
Before I came to Xichang,

19:05.089 --> 19:07.129
I thought this was
a lively and happening place.

19:07.808 --> 19:09.089
I wanted to enrich my experience.

19:09.120 --> 19:11.288
If I had known that I would
experience these incidents,

19:11.609 --> 19:12.968
I wouldn't have come.

19:21.929 --> 19:23.609
Now, I miss

19:23.849 --> 19:25.889
the mound at Laolan Pass.

19:26.328 --> 19:27.328
At that time,

19:27.449 --> 19:28.409
we suffered

19:28.528 --> 19:29.528
so much.

19:29.528 --> 19:30.540
We didn't have much money.

19:31.089 --> 19:33.089
We even had to fight with one another

19:33.120 --> 19:34.649
just to get a bite of the white bread,

19:34.649 --> 19:36.528
but our life was so happy.

19:38.689 --> 19:39.528
Yes.

19:40.449 --> 19:41.568
Those days,

19:42.209 --> 19:43.248
we were really happy.

19:50.728 --> 19:51.889
Mister Shiqi.

19:52.649 --> 19:55.008
People here in the capital
are so unpredictable.

19:55.689 --> 19:56.768
You once said

19:57.288 --> 19:59.248
that we would go back
to Laolan Pass one day.

19:59.568 --> 20:01.209
When will we be going back?

20:06.528 --> 20:08.008
There are things unsettled yet.

20:08.409 --> 20:09.889
When I settle them one by one,

20:10.248 --> 20:11.528
we shall go back.

20:12.609 --> 20:13.649
We won't need to care about

20:13.768 --> 20:15.849
the intrigues in this capital.

20:19.689 --> 20:20.568
Let's go.

20:24.328 --> 20:25.728
(Your Highness, as time goes by,)

20:26.488 --> 20:28.008
(perhaps you would realise)

20:28.929 --> 20:30.328
that you cannot go back

20:30.409 --> 20:31.609
to Laolan Pass

20:32.488 --> 20:34.129
as you wish

20:34.568 --> 20:35.849
and be Shiqi again.

20:36.169 --> 20:38.008
As Lord Qin, you cannot escape

20:38.568 --> 20:40.328
your role as the crown prince.

20:52.768 --> 20:54.449
Mister Shiqi, Taozi sent a letter

20:54.568 --> 20:57.000
stating that Miss Cui is waiting
to meet you at Wonderland.

21:33.498 --> 21:34.221
Ying.

21:34.808 --> 21:35.768
Can you submit a report

21:36.020 --> 21:37.110
to the emperor and marry me?

21:38.649 --> 21:39.689
Shiqi.

21:40.328 --> 21:41.889
Don't you understand?

21:42.129 --> 21:43.609
You shall be the crown prince

21:43.768 --> 21:44.808
in order to marry me,

21:44.929 --> 21:45.609
otherwise,

21:45.728 --> 21:47.089
you are left with nothing.

21:56.929 --> 21:58.248
Can't you trust me?

21:58.500 --> 22:00.328
Can you stop forcing me
and give me some time?

22:00.889 --> 22:02.649
Why are you deceiving
yourself and others?

22:02.728 --> 22:04.060
Then why did you come and meet me?

22:04.568 --> 22:05.048
Indeed.

22:05.520 --> 22:07.270
Everything went
like what you have expected.

22:07.528 --> 22:08.889
What else do you want to do?

22:10.288 --> 22:12.089
I'm not here to laugh at you.

22:12.609 --> 22:14.008
I know that you must be upset

22:14.020 --> 22:15.710
seeing your loved one
do something like this,

22:15.808 --> 22:17.849
so I just want to check on you.

22:21.968 --> 22:22.808
Indeed.

22:23.609 --> 22:25.129
He could do that

22:26.129 --> 22:27.209
to his wife.

22:28.568 --> 22:29.768
It's the Eastern Palace,

22:30.008 --> 22:31.528
it's the position of the crown prince.

22:31.649 --> 22:33.929
Power can make a person frenzied.

22:34.048 --> 22:35.728
That's why I don't want the position!

22:37.020 --> 22:39.200
I've known
that it has been a cage since I was young.

22:39.609 --> 22:41.209
Do you want our children

22:41.889 --> 22:42.849
to be born

22:42.849 --> 22:43.689
in this cage?

22:44.609 --> 22:45.129
Right.

22:45.649 --> 22:48.129
You do know
that power could make a person frenzied.

22:48.140 --> 22:48.849
With this in mind,

22:48.929 --> 22:50.409
do you still want our children

22:50.849 --> 22:52.409
to fight with one another

22:52.768 --> 22:54.328
for this position in the future?

22:55.288 --> 22:57.089
However, you are the emperor's son.

22:57.209 --> 22:59.048
You are Lord Qin
who recaptured two capitals.

22:59.120 --> 23:01.610
You are also the commander-in-chief
of the famous Zhenxi Army.

23:01.649 --> 23:02.689
Don't you think

23:02.808 --> 23:04.248
you are currently in a cage?

23:05.008 --> 23:06.728
I don't mind making myself the bait.

23:07.209 --> 23:08.849
Can't you tell?

23:13.129 --> 23:14.369
I don't want to fight with you.

23:38.108 --> 23:41.611
♪If I forget the fleeting of time♪

23:43.830 --> 23:48.463
♪Waiting for memories
to shatter and sink♪

23:51.065 --> 23:55.299
♪The emotional scars in your heart♪

23:57.197 --> 24:02.174
♪Are the entanglement
I find hard to let go of♪

24:04.869 --> 24:08.596
♪If longing is not forgotten♪

24:10.463 --> 24:15.776
♪I long to return
to the very first moment♪

24:17.369 --> 24:19.089
(Don't you understand?)

24:19.328 --> 24:20.808
(You shall be the crown prince)

24:20.929 --> 24:21.849
(in order to marry me,)

24:21.968 --> 24:22.808
(otherwise,)

24:22.929 --> 24:24.568
(you are left with nothing.)

24:27.048 --> 24:28.369
(Can't you trust me?)

24:28.689 --> 24:31.288
(Can you stop forcing me
and give me some time?)

24:33.170 --> 24:39.303
♪Despite going against fate
I have no regrets loving you♪

24:40.787 --> 24:44.040
♪I'm willing to sacrifice for you♪

24:44.959 --> 24:50.960
♪As I wait for your answer♪

24:54.850 --> 24:59.400
(Tang Confectionery)

24:59.409 --> 24:59.968
Come.

25:01.209 --> 25:03.008
Would you like some pastries?

25:03.889 --> 25:05.129
I want to eat...

25:05.968 --> 25:06.889
I want two of these

25:07.048 --> 25:08.089
and two of these.

25:08.248 --> 25:09.169
Sure.

25:13.488 --> 25:14.209
Ear.

25:14.689 --> 25:15.689
In your opinion,

25:15.808 --> 25:16.889
why did Young Lady

25:17.008 --> 25:18.288
go and meet Lord Qin alone

25:18.300 --> 25:19.450
without bringing me with her?

25:19.728 --> 25:21.409
Is she hiding something from me?

25:21.849 --> 25:22.689
That can't be it.

25:22.929 --> 25:24.209
Miss Cui treats you so well.

25:24.220 --> 25:25.660
She won't hide any secrets from you.

25:26.248 --> 25:27.409
Needless to say,

25:27.649 --> 25:29.488
she treats me very well.

25:30.649 --> 25:32.609
Then why didn't she allow me
to go with her?

25:33.849 --> 25:35.649
Could it be because

25:35.929 --> 25:37.849
she just wants to meet Mister Shiqi alone?

25:39.369 --> 25:39.968
It's just like

25:40.409 --> 25:41.889
me wanting to be

25:42.008 --> 25:43.089
with you alone.

25:43.209 --> 25:43.968
If both Miss Cui

25:44.089 --> 25:45.328
and Mister Shiqi were around,

25:45.449 --> 25:46.488
wouldn't it be difficult

25:46.968 --> 25:48.328
for us to talk?

25:49.288 --> 25:50.089
Perhaps

25:50.449 --> 25:51.728
that's what she thought.

25:54.209 --> 25:55.129
When did you

25:55.209 --> 25:57.169
become so honey-mouthed?

25:57.288 --> 25:58.568
I'm not honey-mouthed,

25:58.808 --> 26:00.328
I'm just telling the truth.

26:04.129 --> 26:04.649
Taozi.

26:06.209 --> 26:07.689
I want to ask you something.

26:08.209 --> 26:08.849
Go ahead.

26:10.728 --> 26:12.248
You haven't answered

26:12.689 --> 26:14.768
the question I asked you

26:15.129 --> 26:16.409
at Wonderland.

26:17.889 --> 26:19.488
Are... Are you...

26:21.288 --> 26:22.409
Are you willing to?

26:26.649 --> 26:27.689
You're such a fool.

26:28.369 --> 26:30.129
If I'm not willing to,

26:30.449 --> 26:31.609
will I still be sitting here

26:31.728 --> 26:33.089
and eating pastries with you?

26:35.568 --> 26:37.609
That's true though.

26:41.488 --> 26:41.929
Eat this.

26:44.169 --> 26:44.849
It's nice, right?

28:33.409 --> 28:34.008
Ying.

28:36.369 --> 28:37.008
You're awake.

28:43.409 --> 28:44.849
Was it you?

28:48.808 --> 28:51.169
I got someone to help you get changed
with clean clothes.

28:53.209 --> 28:53.728
Ying.

28:54.568 --> 28:55.528
It was me

28:55.649 --> 28:56.849
who brought you here.

28:58.288 --> 28:59.089
Don't worry.

28:59.929 --> 29:01.728
This place has beautiful scenery.

29:02.728 --> 29:04.689
It's just like a paradise.

29:05.409 --> 29:06.008
Both of us

29:06.089 --> 29:07.689
can live here.

29:07.968 --> 29:10.528
We don't have to
care about worldly affairs and just relax.

29:10.649 --> 29:11.409
There won't be

29:11.528 --> 29:12.808
people coming to disturb us.

29:16.288 --> 29:17.728
Isn't that a good idea?

29:18.048 --> 29:19.409
What drug did you give me?

29:22.129 --> 29:22.849
Ying.

29:23.169 --> 29:25.288
You shall not get angry.

29:25.849 --> 29:27.609
It's not good for your body.

29:30.089 --> 29:33.328
Your current condition is perfect.

29:34.048 --> 29:36.048
As long as you obey me,

29:36.849 --> 29:38.889
I won't harm you.

29:39.488 --> 29:41.409
I won't harm your father as well.

29:45.768 --> 29:48.248
You are a snob who colluded with Jieshuo.

29:48.849 --> 29:50.609
You even wanted to harm my father.

29:51.409 --> 29:53.209
You will be my sworn enemy!

29:53.369 --> 29:54.209
Look at you.

29:54.528 --> 29:56.209
Speak nicely.

29:57.209 --> 29:58.808
Why did you get angry?

30:04.849 --> 30:05.288
Ying.

30:06.968 --> 30:08.248
What do you want to eat later?

30:09.568 --> 30:11.889
I got them to cook
some of your favourite dishes.

30:12.728 --> 30:18.169
Later, shall we have a meal together?

30:19.409 --> 30:20.728
Get out of my way.

30:27.129 --> 30:27.849
Ying.

30:28.849 --> 30:30.328
From now on,

30:30.488 --> 30:31.849
we will eat together

30:32.409 --> 30:34.369
every single day.

30:35.488 --> 30:37.728
I'll be by your side all the time.

30:39.849 --> 30:40.528
All right?

30:43.089 --> 30:44.528
You'll promise me,

30:45.528 --> 30:46.248
won't you?

30:50.436 --> 30:54.520
(Lord Qin's Residence)

30:54.528 --> 30:55.008
Lord Qin.

30:55.288 --> 30:56.528
Young Lady is missing!

30:56.530 --> 30:58.089
That day, after you said that she had left,

30:58.090 --> 30:59.900
I searched along the route for fear
that I went a wrong way.

30:59.910 --> 31:01.990
I didn't see her at all
even when I reached Luoyang.

31:02.008 --> 31:03.129
Great General was worried

31:03.130 --> 31:05.110
and he sent people to search
for her everywhere but futile.

31:05.328 --> 31:07.248
That's why I came to see you with hope.

31:07.849 --> 31:09.689
Where could she have gone to?

31:10.160 --> 31:11.480
(Relief map)

31:11.528 --> 31:11.968
Taozi.

31:12.288 --> 31:13.728
How do you usually find her?

31:13.889 --> 31:16.169
She has been using
the same herbal spices since young.

31:16.288 --> 31:18.260
I could find her
with just a special ingredient,

31:18.288 --> 31:19.328
but this time,

31:19.488 --> 31:21.449
it didn't work no matter
how hard I tried.

31:22.689 --> 31:23.488
This means

31:23.929 --> 31:25.048
the person who took her

31:25.768 --> 31:27.328
knows these details very well.

31:27.330 --> 31:28.849
That's why he could prepare in advance

31:28.920 --> 31:30.089
so that you wouldn't realise.

31:31.129 --> 31:32.528
Then this person is...

31:34.288 --> 31:35.169
It's Liu Chengfeng.

31:38.728 --> 31:40.288
There is a vast terrain between Luoyang

31:40.649 --> 31:41.689
and Wonderland.

31:42.169 --> 31:43.768
There are many dense forests.

31:43.968 --> 31:45.328
It's not difficult to hide

31:45.449 --> 31:46.449
a person.

31:47.929 --> 31:49.328
If it was really Liu Chengfeng

31:49.449 --> 31:50.649
who held Miss Cui captive,

31:50.660 --> 31:51.728
it would be a big trouble.

31:52.008 --> 31:53.410
He probably didn't stay here for too long.

31:53.488 --> 31:55.889
He might have left for somewhere else
with Miss Cui.

31:56.528 --> 31:57.929
They wouldn't be too far away.

31:58.248 --> 31:58.849
Why?

32:00.808 --> 32:02.209
Ying is way too smart.

32:02.768 --> 32:05.488
If he wanted to go on a long journey
together with her,

32:05.808 --> 32:08.089
it would be very difficult
to not leave any clues behind.

32:10.209 --> 32:12.849
Liu Chengfeng
is very obsessed with Ying.

32:13.129 --> 32:14.248
A scheming person like him

32:14.768 --> 32:16.528
must have planned in advance

32:16.720 --> 32:18.540
and found a place
near Luoyang to settle down.

32:19.449 --> 32:20.449
On the map,

32:20.600 --> 32:22.449
there are so many places
other than Luoyang.

32:22.609 --> 32:23.568
Wouldn't it

32:23.968 --> 32:25.449
take a long time to locate her?

32:26.048 --> 32:26.609
The north.

32:27.288 --> 32:28.089
Only the northern parts.

32:28.528 --> 32:30.369
Since Liu Chengfeng
colludes with Jieshuo,

32:30.609 --> 32:32.089
he will definitely choose somewhere

32:32.160 --> 32:34.209
that he could get support
from the Jieshuo rangers.

32:34.570 --> 32:35.929
Only the northern area is possible.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.770
The northern area
is wide and scarcely inhabited.

32:37.808 --> 32:38.728
The forest is dense.

32:39.089 --> 32:40.089
Most importantly,

32:40.248 --> 32:41.180
going a little up north

32:41.660 --> 32:43.968
is the grassland
where the Jieshuo rangers could support.

32:44.320 --> 32:46.129
Since we have narrowed down
the search area

32:46.248 --> 32:47.288
to just this part,

32:47.300 --> 32:48.700
it will be much easier to look for her.

32:49.140 --> 32:50.048
Let's not waste time.

32:50.169 --> 32:51.089
Let's depart now.

32:51.420 --> 32:53.720
Without the military order,
I couldn't deploy the troops now.

32:53.889 --> 32:56.328
Chang'er, Bao, we shall disguise ourselves
and depart first.

32:56.340 --> 32:56.968
- Yes.
- Yes.

32:57.248 --> 32:57.808
Yuan.

32:57.929 --> 33:01.048
Bring some people to the hunting ground
and then catch up with us.

33:01.050 --> 33:03.110
If anyone asks, tell them we are going
hunting outside the city.

33:03.129 --> 33:03.968
I'll do it right now.

33:20.129 --> 33:20.929
How is it?

33:23.400 --> 33:25.020
We have searched
the hills on both sides.

33:25.030 --> 33:26.000
There's nothing strange.

33:26.010 --> 33:27.929
There are high mountains
and it is sparsely populated.

33:27.929 --> 33:28.980
It's not easy to find her.

33:29.089 --> 33:29.968
Mister Shiqi.

33:30.129 --> 33:31.369
I have an idea.

33:31.609 --> 33:32.288
What is it?

33:32.768 --> 33:35.008
Last time, we used to occupy a hill
and act as the lord.

33:35.160 --> 33:37.409
We were also worried
about the soldiers coming after us.

33:37.409 --> 33:39.840
Therefore, we would try our best
to be secretive in whatever we do.

33:39.929 --> 33:40.968
However, there was

33:40.968 --> 33:41.768
one thing

33:41.768 --> 33:42.849
that we could never hide.

33:43.209 --> 33:44.488
Every person needs salt

33:44.488 --> 33:45.728
to survive.

33:46.209 --> 33:47.328
People who sell salt

33:47.328 --> 33:48.248
wouldn't go

33:48.248 --> 33:49.609
deep into the forest.

33:50.089 --> 33:51.528
To hold Cui Lin hostage,

33:51.540 --> 33:53.210
Liu Chengfeng
must have many subordinates.

33:53.568 --> 33:54.649
This is a remote area.

33:54.649 --> 33:57.609
Salt sold at townships nearby
definitely has a fixed amount.

33:57.609 --> 33:58.328
Commoners

33:58.328 --> 33:59.369
cannot afford salt.

33:59.370 --> 34:01.089
Whenever they buy salt,
they would only buy little.

34:01.089 --> 34:02.328
They won't buy a lot.

34:02.328 --> 34:04.110
Let's investigate
the townships nearby separately.

34:04.120 --> 34:06.500
Ask them whether there were any outsiders
who came and bought salt

34:06.528 --> 34:07.528
at a large amount.

34:07.528 --> 34:08.720
We could follow up from there.

34:09.248 --> 34:09.768
All right.

34:11.288 --> 34:11.848
Here.

34:13.089 --> 34:14.169
Drink the medicine.

34:17.169 --> 34:18.169
Don't worry.

34:19.169 --> 34:20.288
This is not poison.

34:21.649 --> 34:22.969
It's not poison,

34:23.260 --> 34:25.169
but it's something
that could make me feel weak

34:25.169 --> 34:26.489
so that you could detain me, right?

34:26.489 --> 34:27.209
Ying.

34:27.728 --> 34:29.368
I'm doing this for your own good.

34:29.368 --> 34:31.089
Don't be a hypocrite
and tell me all this.

34:31.569 --> 34:33.529
If you had cared about my feelings,

34:33.530 --> 34:35.510
you wouldn't have
colluded with the Jieshuo people,

34:35.529 --> 34:37.209
let alone harming my father.

34:37.848 --> 34:39.368
I didn't have a choice.

34:40.649 --> 34:42.489
If you had married me in the beginning,

34:42.808 --> 34:44.288
I surely wouldn't have been in contact

34:44.288 --> 34:45.368
with the Jieshuo people.

34:45.808 --> 34:46.609
I would've

34:46.609 --> 34:48.049
cared for your father as well.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.288
Anyway, it's all right.

34:53.448 --> 34:55.448
As long as you're
willing to be with me now,

34:56.089 --> 34:57.609
I feel satisfied.

34:58.649 --> 35:01.328
No matter how you hit me and scold me,

35:01.969 --> 35:03.529
I'll enjoy it.

35:11.288 --> 35:12.768
If you refuse to drink it,

35:13.728 --> 35:14.888
I'll feed it to you.

35:19.808 --> 35:21.689
This time, Youren
has made great contributions.

35:21.808 --> 35:23.368
We asked around in the county town.

35:23.569 --> 35:25.368
They said no outsiders
ever came to buy salt.

35:25.370 --> 35:27.550
However, at Huanshan County
located dozens of li away,

35:27.569 --> 35:28.408
someone bought

35:28.408 --> 35:29.768
a lot of salt not long ago.

35:29.768 --> 35:31.009
Therefore, the salt in their county

35:31.009 --> 35:32.810
had been sent to Huanshan
to be sold there.

35:33.368 --> 35:34.848
Don't praise me like that.

35:34.848 --> 35:36.049
It was pure luck.

35:36.049 --> 35:36.649
Look at him.

35:36.649 --> 35:39.070
The salt in Huanshan County was not
necessarily bought by Liu Chengfeng.

35:39.089 --> 35:40.609
How could you say you are lucky?

35:40.620 --> 35:41.969
We haven't started investigating,

35:41.969 --> 35:42.848
but what if it was him?

35:42.848 --> 35:44.129
- What if it wasn't him?
- What if it was him?

35:44.129 --> 35:45.328
No, I said...

35:45.328 --> 35:46.009
Youde.

35:46.209 --> 35:46.649
No.

35:46.689 --> 35:47.649
Listen to Mister Shiqi.

35:47.969 --> 35:49.209
Let's continue searching

35:49.368 --> 35:50.288
every hill separately.

35:50.300 --> 35:51.740
This area is about a hundred li wide.

35:51.808 --> 35:52.689
Each of us

35:52.768 --> 35:53.808
shall bring more people.

35:53.810 --> 35:55.489
Bao, stay in the middle
as the contact point.

35:55.489 --> 35:55.969
All right.

35:56.649 --> 35:57.129
Let's go.

35:57.129 --> 35:57.969
- All right.
- Yes!

36:17.209 --> 36:17.848
Young Master.

36:17.850 --> 36:19.710
There seem to be strangers
in villages nearby.

36:20.009 --> 36:22.328
Our guards outside
also saw hoofprints on the ground.

36:25.089 --> 36:26.848
Li Ni is blamed.

36:27.448 --> 36:28.848
Li Ni's nose so sensitive.

36:29.448 --> 36:30.209
Now that

36:30.248 --> 36:31.728
he came to me himself,

36:32.848 --> 36:33.728
this is just right.

36:34.408 --> 36:36.009
I shall capture him

36:36.009 --> 36:36.969
and all his henchmen.

36:37.169 --> 36:39.368
Then I shall kill them in front of Ying.

37:04.489 --> 37:05.368
This is the place.

37:05.969 --> 37:07.689
Mister Shiqi, what do we do?

37:07.848 --> 37:08.969
Don't alert them first.

37:09.129 --> 37:10.220
You go and send the signal.

37:10.248 --> 37:11.410
I'll go in and check out the place.

37:11.448 --> 37:12.129
All right.

37:40.328 --> 37:41.169
Ying.

37:42.129 --> 37:43.089
What are you looking at?

37:43.800 --> 37:45.288
You seem to be deeply absorbed in it.

37:56.089 --> 37:57.089
Look.

37:58.768 --> 38:00.248
Look at what I've brought you.

38:04.089 --> 38:05.009
I know

38:05.848 --> 38:07.529
that you were also upset

38:08.089 --> 38:09.888
when our wedding at Changzhou

38:10.248 --> 38:11.848
was interrupted.

38:12.089 --> 38:13.288
Therefore, this time,

38:13.649 --> 38:14.969
I picked a few

38:14.969 --> 38:16.248
wedding gowns for you.

38:17.569 --> 38:19.009
Choose the one you like.

38:19.328 --> 38:20.888
Let's have our wedding

38:21.248 --> 38:22.609
happily.

38:22.928 --> 38:23.928
Liu Chengfeng.

38:25.489 --> 38:26.169
Do you know

38:26.169 --> 38:27.288
what you are doing?

38:27.288 --> 38:29.328
I'm getting ready to get married to you.

38:33.808 --> 38:35.248
You know very well

38:35.808 --> 38:37.689
that I won't ever marry you.

38:39.448 --> 38:41.169
You and I grew up together.

38:41.928 --> 38:42.768
I treat you

38:42.768 --> 38:44.248
like an elder brother.

38:44.569 --> 38:45.808
To me,

38:46.288 --> 38:47.448
you are my elder brother.

38:47.448 --> 38:48.049
Stop it!

38:48.969 --> 38:50.209
Stop saying things like this

38:50.209 --> 38:51.209
to prevaricate.

38:52.089 --> 38:52.928
Your father

38:52.928 --> 38:54.529
has never treated me like his son.

38:54.529 --> 38:55.408
I'm also not

38:55.408 --> 38:56.288
your elder brother.

38:56.768 --> 38:58.209
It was all because of Li Ni.

38:58.969 --> 39:00.728
If Li Ni hadn't existed,

39:01.408 --> 39:03.049
you would've been married to me already.

39:03.049 --> 39:04.248
You also wouldn't have said

39:04.248 --> 39:05.609
something so ruthless!

39:05.609 --> 39:08.210
Whether there was Li Ni or not,
I wouldn't fall in love with you.

39:11.928 --> 39:14.009
Father has asked me a few times

39:14.328 --> 39:15.728
whether I want to be married to you.

39:17.248 --> 39:18.009
He felt that

39:18.009 --> 39:19.368
since we grew up together,

39:19.420 --> 39:21.110
you've been caring
for me in every aspect.

39:22.649 --> 39:23.728
He was thinking

39:24.529 --> 39:25.928
if he passed away

39:26.848 --> 39:28.529
one day,

39:29.969 --> 39:30.928
would I be lonely

39:30.928 --> 39:32.049
when I was left all alone?

39:33.049 --> 39:34.808
If you could take care of me,

39:35.489 --> 39:37.009
he might not need to worry.

39:38.808 --> 39:40.209
However, I told him

39:41.209 --> 39:42.888
that I won't be married to you,

39:44.529 --> 39:45.768
or perhaps

39:47.049 --> 39:47.888
I didn't intend

39:47.888 --> 39:48.888
to get married at all.

39:53.089 --> 39:55.129
However, you submitted
a report to the emperor

39:56.368 --> 39:57.928
that you wish to marry

39:57.928 --> 39:58.969
one of the three princes.

40:00.649 --> 40:01.728
You're lying.

40:02.649 --> 40:04.888
It's not that you don't want
to get married at all.

40:05.368 --> 40:07.328
You don't want to marry me at all.

40:07.328 --> 40:08.820
There's no need for me to lie to you.

40:09.920 --> 40:12.110
At one point, I really didn't have
the intention to get married.

40:13.009 --> 40:14.808
A female has to
face so many difficulties.

40:15.888 --> 40:17.328
I only live once.

40:17.330 --> 40:19.009
If no one understands me
and knows me well,

40:19.009 --> 40:20.489
why must I be married to someone?

40:21.089 --> 40:24.689
Can't I live happily and freely alone?

40:24.689 --> 40:26.288
Do I not understand you

40:26.689 --> 40:27.689
and know you well?

40:31.209 --> 40:32.808
You used to respect me

40:33.408 --> 40:34.728
and treat me well,

40:35.928 --> 40:37.808
but that was neither understanding me

40:38.009 --> 40:39.569
nor knowing me well.

40:41.888 --> 40:43.368
Before I met Li Ni,

40:44.569 --> 40:45.649
I thought

40:45.808 --> 40:47.448
it's fine to be alone,

40:48.848 --> 40:50.529
but after I met him,

40:53.609 --> 40:55.689
I only want to be with him.

40:58.248 --> 40:58.969
Ying.

41:01.569 --> 41:02.529
My love for you

41:02.529 --> 41:03.848
has already reached this extent.

41:05.609 --> 41:08.009
Why did you say something like this
to hurt me?

41:08.728 --> 41:09.649
Is it because

41:09.649 --> 41:11.169
I'm associated with the Jieshuo people?

41:11.328 --> 41:13.049
Are you mad because of that?

41:13.209 --> 41:14.248
Do you hate me?

41:15.089 --> 41:16.848
I just want to survive.

41:18.209 --> 41:19.448
If I die,

41:21.288 --> 41:22.529
will you remember me?

41:23.848 --> 41:25.049
You won't!

41:25.209 --> 41:26.928
You'll forget about me immediately!

41:26.940 --> 41:28.368
You'll put everything
about me behind you!

41:28.368 --> 41:29.328
You'll marry Li Ni

41:29.328 --> 41:31.408
and live happily ever after!

41:31.969 --> 41:33.808
You'll forget about me forever.

41:33.969 --> 41:35.888
You'll forget about me forever.

41:36.888 --> 41:38.288
Therefore, I mustn't die.

41:38.288 --> 41:39.649
I mustn't die!

41:39.649 --> 41:41.209
I cannot allow you to marry Li Ni.

41:41.209 --> 41:43.368
That's why I approached
the Jieshuo people.

41:46.089 --> 41:46.928
Young Master.

41:50.569 --> 41:52.089
This might be the last time

41:52.089 --> 41:53.169
I'm calling you this.

41:55.129 --> 41:57.240
It's because the elder brother
who used to care for me

41:57.689 --> 41:59.328
and deserved my respect

42:00.529 --> 42:02.009
is dead.

42:04.569 --> 42:05.808
He is dead.

42:07.768 --> 42:09.489
He died in that river.

42:11.569 --> 42:12.768
Of course, you have the right

42:12.768 --> 42:14.448
to choose to survive,

42:15.020 --> 42:17.288
but you approached the Jieshuo people
for your survival.

42:17.288 --> 42:18.009
You cannot say

42:18.009 --> 42:19.649
that it was all for me!

42:23.328 --> 42:24.768
After all is said,

42:27.328 --> 42:28.689
now everything...

42:31.489 --> 42:32.888
Now everything

42:35.248 --> 42:36.368
seems to be

42:36.368 --> 42:37.689
all my fault.

42:41.169 --> 42:42.089
Ying.

42:44.489 --> 42:46.169
How cruel you are.

42:47.888 --> 42:49.569
I've done so much for you,

42:50.649 --> 42:53.609
but now you make it sound like
I have only myself to blame.

42:54.848 --> 42:56.089
To you,

42:56.248 --> 42:58.649
you see no one other than Li Ni!

43:02.408 --> 43:03.969
Anyway, it's all right, Ying.

43:04.969 --> 43:06.248
No matter what you say,

43:06.969 --> 43:07.969
you'll never

43:09.209 --> 43:11.489
get to see Li Ni
anymore in your entire life.

43:13.209 --> 43:14.089
I won't

43:14.089 --> 43:15.768
let him take you away from me.

43:17.248 --> 43:19.569
You'll surely become my wife.

43:19.728 --> 43:20.701
In your dreams!

43:21.368 --> 43:23.129
Never will I marry you!

43:23.569 --> 43:25.928
Not only Li Ni,
but also my father and his men

43:25.928 --> 43:27.089
will come and rescue me.

43:27.448 --> 43:28.808
You won't get away from this.

43:30.009 --> 43:31.808
The Cui Army has numerous cavalrymen.

43:32.169 --> 43:33.969
You've seen with your own eyes

43:34.129 --> 43:36.448
how the Cui Army's cavalrymen charge.

43:37.328 --> 43:37.928
My father

43:37.928 --> 43:39.569
will ride a horse here

43:39.888 --> 43:41.448
and crush your bones.

43:47.368 --> 43:48.209
Mister Shiqi.

43:48.328 --> 43:49.448
Bao is ready.

43:49.448 --> 43:50.480
Just wait for them to take the bait.

43:51.129 --> 43:52.209
Get ready.

43:52.649 --> 43:53.049
Yes.

43:53.049 --> 43:54.009
- Yes.
- Yes.

44:08.328 --> 44:09.049
Young Master,

44:10.129 --> 44:11.180
the rangers sent a message.

44:11.248 --> 44:12.248
At a hundred li away,

44:12.250 --> 44:13.870
they saw traces of
cavalrymen who might have passed by.

44:13.888 --> 44:16.060
Great General might be approaching
us with his cavalry.

44:16.328 --> 44:18.129
If he reaches here with his cavalry,

44:18.649 --> 44:21.728
all the decorations we've put up
will be useless.

44:21.930 --> 44:24.009
Furthermore, the cavalry even
have armored horses.

44:24.160 --> 44:26.240
When faced with them,
our strategy will not work.

44:26.320 --> 44:28.300
They will reach here
at the latest by tomorrow noon.

44:28.569 --> 44:29.328
Young Master.

44:29.330 --> 44:31.209
Please take our men
back to Jieshuo's territory first

44:31.209 --> 44:32.570
using the trail over the mountain.

44:32.728 --> 44:33.808
I will stay here

44:34.089 --> 44:36.009
as if you and Lieutenant He are still here.

44:36.009 --> 44:37.100
I will hold the Great General off.
