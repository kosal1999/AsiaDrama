02:03.840 --> 02:07.310
The Governor wins again

02:10.630 --> 02:12.750
It seems you are going to lose today

02:13.560 --> 02:14.800
That's not necessarily the case

02:25.520 --> 02:29.120
Concubine Xiao wins again

02:30.190 --> 02:30.910
all right

02:31.560 --> 02:32.870
Come and play again

02:32.870 --> 02:33.190
good

02:38.430 --> 02:39.120
Grand Governor

03:10.430 --> 03:11.560
Food is lost

03:11.910 --> 03:13.280
The city was also lost

03:13.680 --> 03:15.800
I didn’t expect Guo Zhi to be so useless.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.150
This is Li Ni, the grandson of the Seventeenth Emperor

03:19.400 --> 03:20.030
Quite a bit

03:20.280 --> 03:21.680
Let people treat their descendants of the Li family

03:21.800 --> 03:22.840
impressed

03:24.710 --> 03:26.080
The old slave deserves to die

03:26.190 --> 03:28.240
Dirty the governor's balls

03:28.360 --> 03:29.310
Call Liang Wang

03:29.960 --> 03:30.870
yes

03:31.430 --> 03:34.030
Biography of King Liang

03:43.190 --> 03:46.150
I met the great governor

03:47.310 --> 03:48.630
Help the king of Liang get up

03:56.590 --> 03:57.870
you are a prince

03:58.030 --> 03:59.280
I'm just a governor

03:59.630 --> 04:01.120
Why do you see me every time

04:01.240 --> 04:03.000
You have to give such a big gift.

04:08.280 --> 04:10.430
Princess Tai

04:10.800 --> 04:13.560
Xiao Wang pays homage to the Crown Princess

04:15.280 --> 04:17.240
The first prince was foolish and ignorant

04:17.600 --> 04:19.560
I have already committed suicide to thank the world

04:20.310 --> 04:22.190
I am no longer a princess.

04:22.480 --> 04:23.680
I also look forward to the future of King Liang

04:24.000 --> 04:25.190
Don’t compare it to this

04:25.720 --> 04:26.680
Yes Yes Yes

04:27.040 --> 04:28.310
Concubine Xiao

04:29.270 --> 04:30.510
Tell us about your son

04:31.070 --> 04:33.070
This was asked by the great governor

04:33.510 --> 04:35.560
Xiao Wang has three sons

04:35.800 --> 04:36.920
eldest son Li

04:37.480 --> 04:39.270
Who wants to listen to this nonsense?

04:40.800 --> 04:41.800
Let’s talk about Li Yi

04:42.680 --> 04:44.120
just just

04:44.680 --> 04:48.000
Seventeenth Seventeenth Lang Li Yita

04:48.950 --> 04:50.040
What's up with him

04:51.240 --> 04:52.480
King Liang, do you know your guilt?

04:53.310 --> 04:54.310
two months ago

04:54.390 --> 04:55.950
Pei Xian and others actually served Li Ni

04:56.120 --> 04:57.920
For the so-called counterinsurgency marshal

04:58.870 --> 05:00.390
A young Li Ni

05:00.510 --> 05:02.160
Being defeated by a rebel general like Pei Xian

05:02.270 --> 05:03.160
Become the commander

05:03.720 --> 05:04.480
Liang Wang

05:04.830 --> 05:06.120
You are doing this in secret

05:06.510 --> 05:07.390
Are you coveting a big position?

05:07.480 --> 05:08.040
This this

05:09.430 --> 05:10.600
rude to children

05:10.680 --> 05:12.390
Child is rude

05:12.920 --> 05:13.190
this

05:13.270 --> 05:14.870
Xiao Wang really doesn’t know this

05:14.950 --> 05:15.560
This Li Yi

05:15.630 --> 05:17.750
To be able to do such a thing

05:17.870 --> 05:19.510
I really don't know

05:19.720 --> 05:21.360
Seek guidance from the Governor

05:21.510 --> 05:22.160
okay

05:23.310 --> 05:24.480
This is Pei Xian

05:24.600 --> 05:26.000
Demagoguery

05:26.510 --> 05:28.240
Just tell me honestly

05:28.680 --> 05:29.800
Your son

05:29.870 --> 05:31.120
What did you like growing up?

05:31.240 --> 05:32.190
don't like what

05:32.430 --> 05:34.190
What is your personality and temper like?

05:36.270 --> 05:38.480
Xiao Wang’s son

05:40.830 --> 05:44.040
What an ominous son!

05:46.270 --> 05:47.310
seventeen

05:47.560 --> 05:48.830
Li Yi was born

05:49.040 --> 05:51.360
He killed his biological mother

05:52.390 --> 05:54.390
He has been naughty since childhood

05:54.390 --> 05:55.560
Unlearned and incompetent

05:55.950 --> 05:57.480
I am a father

05:57.600 --> 05:59.920
He also neglected to discipline him

06:01.600 --> 06:02.070
give me back

06:02.190 --> 06:02.800
The maid gives birth to a son

06:02.950 --> 06:04.480
Your mother is the humblest slave

06:04.600 --> 06:04.870
give me back

06:05.040 --> 06:06.040
sooner or later one day

06:06.310 --> 06:07.000
You will kill us

06:07.000 --> 06:07.480
give me back

06:08.630 --> 06:09.750
give me back

06:12.240 --> 06:13.630
Wait until he is older

06:13.750 --> 06:15.310
Even more idle

06:15.480 --> 06:16.870
Fighting and causing trouble

06:17.270 --> 06:18.240
This matter today

06:18.360 --> 06:19.560
You have to give me an explanation

06:19.680 --> 06:20.070
otherwise

06:20.560 --> 06:22.120
What are you doing?

06:22.480 --> 06:24.070
Breech baby

06:24.310 --> 06:24.800
stand up

06:25.510 --> 06:26.870
Xiao Wang’s son

06:26.870 --> 06:28.070
Really naughty

06:28.070 --> 06:29.600
Extremely badass

06:29.600 --> 06:31.870
What a bastard

06:32.190 --> 06:33.800
Just because he is like this

06:34.270 --> 06:35.070
father emperor

06:35.390 --> 06:35.830
No

06:36.240 --> 06:38.040
The late emperor was furious

06:38.510 --> 06:40.560
Demoted him to Zhenxi Army

06:40.560 --> 06:42.830
But Xiao Wang never expected

06:43.120 --> 06:45.310
He is so bold

06:45.630 --> 06:46.040
This this

06:46.160 --> 06:48.120
What kind of marshal do you dare to call yourself?

06:48.560 --> 06:50.800
Against the Governor

06:51.190 --> 06:53.430
It’s true that an evil moon gives birth to an evil son

06:53.430 --> 06:55.720
Li Yi is still young now

06:55.800 --> 06:57.950
You can use this trick to occupy my Wangzhou

06:58.070 --> 06:59.240
It's really unworthy

06:59.390 --> 07:00.600
Not worth it enough

07:01.510 --> 07:03.120
people like you

07:03.240 --> 07:04.120
How can it be born

07:04.240 --> 07:05.040
Like Li Yi

07:05.160 --> 07:06.920
The gifted son

07:19.920 --> 07:20.600
Lift it down

07:20.800 --> 07:21.360
yes

07:32.390 --> 07:33.750
This time we got a bargain

07:33.870 --> 07:34.950
Occupied Wangzhou City

07:35.800 --> 07:37.600
But Guo Zhi's army was not damaged

07:37.750 --> 07:39.430
Moreover, the merger of states and the establishment of states

07:39.630 --> 07:41.190
In the hands of Han Li again

07:41.360 --> 07:43.480
I'm just afraid that Sun Jing will send Han Li to send troops

07:43.630 --> 07:45.390
He and Guo Zhi attacked us from both sides.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.870
Then we will capture Wangzhou first

07:48.240 --> 07:49.390
Another plan to merge the states

07:50.040 --> 07:50.600
you guess

07:51.190 --> 07:52.920
What are the Cui family doing now?

07:53.560 --> 07:54.310
Cui family

07:57.310 --> 07:58.600
We're right under their noses

07:58.600 --> 07:59.120
Picked up Wangzhou City

07:59.240 --> 08:00.630
Such a big one is cheap

08:00.800 --> 08:03.070
Cui Yi's only son personally led the troops

08:03.560 --> 08:05.750
Raising troops and mobilizing people but returning in vain

08:06.040 --> 08:07.480
You'll definitely be furious

08:08.190 --> 08:09.480
you mean

08:09.870 --> 08:11.480
Guo Zhi's army hangs alone outside the city

08:11.600 --> 08:13.950
No city to occupy, no food to eat

08:14.430 --> 08:15.870
If I were from the Cui family

08:16.240 --> 08:17.190
I will definitely send someone

08:17.310 --> 08:18.920
Go to Guo Zhijun for peace talks

08:19.680 --> 08:21.800
Encircle and attack him

08:22.070 --> 08:23.800
Capture Wangzhou City in one fell swoop

08:24.120 --> 08:25.510
kick me out

08:26.920 --> 08:27.950
I don't allow you to go

08:28.560 --> 08:29.070
Young Master

08:29.190 --> 08:31.360
The two armies are fighting without killing the envoy

08:31.630 --> 08:32.550
As the envoy of Cui Jiajun, I

08:32.720 --> 08:33.240
Go to

08:33.440 --> 08:34.000
Guo Zhi, he can’t

08:34.150 --> 08:35.240
What to do to me

08:38.670 --> 08:39.270
Aying

08:39.750 --> 08:41.240
I don't want you to be in danger again

08:42.120 --> 08:42.790
Young Master

08:43.200 --> 08:44.080
you guess

08:44.270 --> 08:45.840
At this moment, the people in the Zhenxi Army

08:45.960 --> 08:47.030
doing what

08:48.200 --> 08:49.750
If I were in the Zhenxi Army

08:50.080 --> 08:50.510
knowing that

08:50.630 --> 08:52.080
It was Cui Jiajun who stole the food and grass

08:52.200 --> 08:52.790
Now I know

08:52.960 --> 08:54.390
Guo Zhi hangs alone outside the city

08:54.480 --> 08:56.480
No food to eat, no city to occupy

08:56.840 --> 08:58.120
I definitely want to go to Guo Zhijun Middle School

08:58.240 --> 08:59.000
Make peace with him

08:59.120 --> 09:00.150
give him benefits

09:00.240 --> 09:01.670
Discuss with him to encircle together

09:01.750 --> 09:03.120
Attack our Cui Jiajun from both sides

09:03.240 --> 09:04.550
So that I can get my food back

09:04.840 --> 09:06.440
Then let's strike first

09:06.550 --> 09:07.600
no no no

09:07.720 --> 09:10.000
The plank road was repaired in the open, but Chencang was buried in the dark

09:10.630 --> 09:12.390
I went out of the city to have peace talks with Guo Zhi

09:12.790 --> 09:14.440
When I get to Guo Zhijun,

09:14.790 --> 09:16.870
The Cui family will naturally consider it

09:17.120 --> 09:19.150
Is it a good deal to be my enemy?

09:19.550 --> 09:21.150
You'd better form an alliance with me first

09:21.360 --> 09:23.080
It's a good deal to deal with Guo Zhi

09:23.720 --> 09:24.670
Then how do you know

09:24.840 --> 09:25.870
Someone named Cui will definitely send someone

09:25.960 --> 09:27.270
Are you negotiating with Guo Zhi?

09:27.910 --> 09:29.030
Since the war

09:29.320 --> 09:30.440
Cui Yi was ambitious

09:30.550 --> 09:31.790
Send an army south

09:32.120 --> 09:33.360
It can be seen that he never misses an opportunity.

09:33.510 --> 09:34.510
smart people

09:35.320 --> 09:36.960
Such a big piece of cake

09:37.550 --> 09:38.390
Will he let it go?

09:38.750 --> 09:39.510
I'm planning to

09:39.790 --> 09:42.150
The plank road was repaired in the open, but Chencang was buried in the dark

09:42.320 --> 09:44.000
Wait until I get to Guo Zhi's army

09:44.200 --> 09:45.440
Presumably the Zhenxi Army

09:45.600 --> 09:47.200
Important people will definitely be sent out

09:47.390 --> 09:48.150
I guess

09:48.390 --> 09:49.150
Eighty percent of it is the one named Pei

09:49.320 --> 09:50.240
come forward in person

09:50.480 --> 09:51.870
Waiting to borrow Guo Zhi's territory

09:52.080 --> 09:53.270
I will talk to the people from the Zhenxi Army again

09:53.390 --> 09:54.390
The interview is

09:54.510 --> 09:55.630
But according to what you said

09:55.870 --> 09:57.440
Isn't the other party very difficult to deal with?

09:57.840 --> 09:59.750
That’s why I want to borrow Guo Zhi’s territory

10:00.200 --> 10:01.360
To show sincerity

10:01.600 --> 10:03.120
I'm sure I'll only bring my personal guards with me.

10:03.630 --> 10:04.480
By the time

10:04.630 --> 10:06.080
Surrounded by Guo Zhi's army

10:06.390 --> 10:08.030
Even if he wants to play some tricks

10:08.240 --> 10:09.550
It’s also difficult to cast

10:09.790 --> 10:10.120
But I think

10:10.270 --> 10:11.150
Still too dangerous

10:11.550 --> 10:12.670
You defend the city

10:12.870 --> 10:14.670
I went out of the city to talk to Guo Zhi

10:15.790 --> 10:17.670
Of course General Pei is going.

10:18.080 --> 10:18.630
And me

10:18.910 --> 10:20.440
Just write a handwritten letter at home

10:20.910 --> 10:21.720
Print again

10:21.960 --> 10:23.790
The seal of our counterinsurgent marshal

10:24.320 --> 10:25.870
to show our sincerity

10:26.670 --> 10:28.320
I plan to use you as a carrot again

10:28.550 --> 10:29.720
Carve one yourself

10:30.670 --> 10:32.600
Anyway, Guo Zhi and the Cui family

10:32.750 --> 10:34.320
never seen me

10:35.440 --> 10:36.320
handsome seal

10:55.720 --> 10:57.600
It turned out to be He Xiaowei from Cui Jiajun

10:57.840 --> 10:58.870
first meet

10:59.440 --> 11:00.550
Nice to meet you

11:02.080 --> 11:02.870
It turned out to be from the Zhenxi Army

11:03.030 --> 11:04.320
General Pei

11:04.720 --> 11:06.000
Your Majesty, General Pei

11:06.120 --> 11:07.360
Guarding the border for many years

11:07.510 --> 11:08.790
prestigious

11:10.240 --> 11:11.390
Admire for a long time

11:12.960 --> 11:14.630
Both are young talents

11:14.960 --> 11:17.390
Today is an eye-opener for Guo

11:17.960 --> 11:20.390
General Pei personally came to discuss peace

11:20.910 --> 11:22.670
Cui Gongzi sent He Xiaowei

11:22.790 --> 11:23.910
Also come to discuss peace

11:24.600 --> 11:26.510
Guo was really flattered

11:26.720 --> 11:28.000
Sincerely fearful

11:28.630 --> 11:29.200
Afraid of letting down

11:29.320 --> 11:31.240
Some kind words from General Pei

11:31.720 --> 11:34.550
And I was afraid of displeasing Mr. Cui

11:35.630 --> 11:38.510
It's really difficult for me

11:41.080 --> 11:42.360
General Guo is a heretic

11:43.630 --> 11:45.030
General Guo is polite.

11:46.840 --> 11:47.840
How about this?

11:48.030 --> 11:49.840
Each of our three parties will send one person

11:50.000 --> 11:51.030
Have a horse race

11:51.720 --> 11:53.320
If my people win

11:53.720 --> 11:54.550
Please two

11:54.750 --> 11:56.360
Everyone agrees to a condition

11:56.790 --> 11:58.630
If there are two people, who will win?

11:59.600 --> 12:01.150
Then who should I talk to first?

12:02.390 --> 12:04.960
I don’t know what you two think

12:09.840 --> 12:11.120
very fair

12:11.480 --> 12:13.360
Since General Pei is so generous,

12:13.600 --> 12:15.750
Of course I have nothing to say

12:16.360 --> 12:16.840
good

12:17.240 --> 12:18.750
Both of them are cheerful people

12:19.080 --> 12:19.720
please

12:25.670 --> 12:26.320
general

12:26.840 --> 12:27.790
go all out

12:27.960 --> 12:28.390
yes

12:28.910 --> 12:29.480
long ears

12:30.480 --> 12:31.360
Be cautious

12:32.000 --> 12:32.480
yes

12:34.270 --> 12:35.670
You are a good horse

12:36.150 --> 12:37.390
Your horse is pretty good too

12:38.000 --> 12:39.360
General Pei deserves the award.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.390
That little General Pei thinks

12:41.670 --> 12:43.240
Who will be the final winner?

12:43.630 --> 12:44.600
Never tried

12:44.750 --> 12:46.200
Who knows who will win?

13:25.960 --> 13:26.960
General Pei

13:27.080 --> 13:29.150
Have you ever met Captain He before?

13:29.960 --> 13:30.510
Never

13:30.790 --> 13:31.910
Your Majesty

13:31.960 --> 13:33.480
Seriously injured at Huya Pass

13:33.750 --> 13:34.750
Later every time it rained

13:34.870 --> 13:36.150
Old injuries will recur

13:36.510 --> 13:37.600
unbearable soreness

13:38.080 --> 13:40.320
I wonder if it has been better in recent years

13:41.550 --> 13:42.670
Thank you General for your greetings

13:43.150 --> 13:44.870
My father suffered from many old wounds

13:45.240 --> 13:47.360
The arrow wound under the ribs is the most dangerous

13:48.080 --> 13:48.630
Although so many years

13:48.750 --> 13:49.790
Always in the military

13:50.200 --> 13:51.360
But take good care of it

13:51.510 --> 13:52.480
Already much better

13:55.270 --> 13:56.550
That's good

13:57.840 --> 13:58.960
No limit to weapons

13:59.440 --> 14:00.550
Click till then

14:01.080 --> 14:02.270
Don't hurt your life

14:03.000 --> 14:03.790
after capture the flag

14:04.270 --> 14:05.750
Who returns here first

14:05.960 --> 14:07.670
Insert the small flag into this circle

14:08.870 --> 14:09.840
is the winner

14:12.080 --> 14:12.600
Set off

14:54.790 --> 14:56.670
Lieutenant He's bodyguards are really powerful

14:56.840 --> 14:57.870
It seems that this round

14:58.030 --> 14:59.720
Captain He is going to win

15:00.150 --> 15:00.720
where

15:01.120 --> 15:01.320
This person

15:01.390 --> 15:02.790
They are the bodyguards of our Mr. Cui.

15:02.870 --> 15:04.080
The young master sent me as an envoy

15:04.510 --> 15:06.150
He was specially sent to take care of one or two

15:06.480 --> 15:07.080
Moreover

15:07.440 --> 15:08.440
The end has not yet come

15:08.790 --> 15:10.320
How can we talk about winning or losing lightly?

16:19.670 --> 16:20.870
brothers brothers

16:20.960 --> 16:21.600
wake up

16:21.960 --> 16:22.360
brother

16:23.870 --> 16:24.390
Wake up

16:24.480 --> 16:25.240
Wake up

16:26.200 --> 16:27.600
brothers brothers

16:30.360 --> 16:30.720
brother

16:30.840 --> 16:31.200
Comrades

16:31.320 --> 16:32.390
brothers brothers

16:35.440 --> 16:35.840
brother

16:35.960 --> 16:36.510
Comrades

16:36.600 --> 16:37.200
brother

16:39.030 --> 16:40.080
I made a mistake

16:42.750 --> 16:44.440
With the skill of this strong soldier just now,

16:44.790 --> 16:46.200
You can completely avoid that arrow

16:46.960 --> 16:48.360
He is eager to win

16:48.750 --> 16:50.360
So I never dodge

16:51.120 --> 16:51.910
This person is loyal and brave

16:52.270 --> 16:53.200
We admire

16:53.630 --> 16:54.840
The general wins now

16:55.360 --> 16:56.270
According to the preface

16:56.600 --> 16:57.390
Me and Cui Jiajun

16:57.910 --> 16:59.480
Each agrees to a condition for the general

17:00.150 --> 17:01.550
Please also ask General Guo to speak frankly.

17:05.750 --> 17:07.200
It's getting late today

17:07.640 --> 17:08.880
I will continue to work for this comrade

17:09.000 --> 17:09.550
buried

17:10.920 --> 17:12.510
I'm so sad right now

17:13.200 --> 17:14.000
Two more please

17:14.480 --> 17:15.720
Stay in camp tonight

17:16.160 --> 17:17.350
Let’s talk tomorrow

17:18.400 --> 17:19.590
But according to the general's orders

17:21.000 --> 17:22.110
General's condolences

17:24.550 --> 17:25.200
general

17:25.920 --> 17:26.590
today

17:26.920 --> 17:28.160
Although I lost my comrades in the army,

17:28.200 --> 17:29.160
a life

17:29.550 --> 17:30.680
but always win

17:31.590 --> 17:32.480
The general feels

17:32.880 --> 17:34.160
Let the two of them be together tomorrow

17:34.550 --> 17:36.070
What conditions can we agree to?

17:37.240 --> 17:39.030
Pei Yuan is in crisis

17:39.160 --> 17:40.550
Instead, he rescued Captain He

17:40.750 --> 17:41.510
both of them

17:41.920 --> 17:43.830
It is clear that friends outweigh enemies

17:44.510 --> 17:46.070
Just in case the two of them have other plans

17:46.550 --> 17:47.160
Just afraid

17:47.510 --> 17:49.000
They agreed to our terms

17:49.310 --> 17:50.750
It's all just a trap

17:53.720 --> 17:54.720
today

17:54.790 --> 17:56.480
I must kill these two people

17:56.750 --> 17:58.070
in front of the governor

17:58.200 --> 17:59.880
With the heads of these two people

18:00.550 --> 18:02.240
Even if we lose our city and food

18:03.070 --> 18:04.550
You can also explain it to me

18:04.880 --> 18:06.270
What does the general mean?

18:09.270 --> 18:10.510
Last time Dr. Fan

18:10.640 --> 18:11.680
It’s not like we made a lot of them

18:11.790 --> 18:13.400
Special pastries?

18:14.070 --> 18:15.270
You go get two copies

18:16.000 --> 18:17.350
Find two smart people

18:17.830 --> 18:19.590
Send one to each of them

18:21.920 --> 18:22.830
This healthy soldier

18:23.110 --> 18:23.590
really one

18:23.680 --> 18:25.030
A rare brave man

18:25.310 --> 18:26.880
No wonder General Guo thinks so highly of him

18:27.030 --> 18:28.270
Hold his funeral in person

18:28.590 --> 18:29.720
Then the people from Cui Jiajun now

18:29.790 --> 18:30.880
I must regret it very much

18:31.270 --> 18:31.830
they missed

18:31.920 --> 18:33.510
General Guo lost a comrade

18:33.960 --> 18:34.680
Peace talks tomorrow

18:35.110 --> 18:36.480
They have lost the initiative

18:37.350 --> 18:38.160
of course not

18:39.310 --> 18:40.030
They were not originally

18:40.160 --> 18:41.310
Came to talk to Guo Zhi

18:41.640 --> 18:43.310
This Colonel He has always been cunning

18:43.750 --> 18:44.720
You won't suffer for sure

18:45.400 --> 18:46.790
So what should we do now

18:48.790 --> 18:50.160
Of course go

18:50.350 --> 18:52.350
Let’s meet Captain He for a while.

19:11.480 --> 19:12.000
Oops

19:19.830 --> 19:21.110
midnight

19:21.240 --> 19:22.000
General Pei

19:22.110 --> 19:23.070
It was the last time I took a bath in the well

19:23.160 --> 19:24.680
Very comfortable to wash

19:25.240 --> 19:26.590
So you came to me specially

19:27.400 --> 19:28.510
A well of grace

19:28.790 --> 19:29.960
Never forget

19:30.480 --> 19:31.880
Remember next time

19:32.000 --> 19:33.240
girl's kindness

19:34.790 --> 19:35.880
Don't think I don't know

19:36.200 --> 19:37.550
I think about you all the time

19:37.790 --> 19:38.400
Kick me in anytime

19:38.510 --> 19:39.200
In that well

19:39.310 --> 19:40.310
Good to pay back the grudge of that well

19:40.400 --> 19:41.000
right

19:41.400 --> 19:42.110
no problem

19:42.310 --> 19:42.920
I am waiting

19:49.680 --> 19:50.550
Return the property to its original owner

19:50.750 --> 19:51.310
Thank you very much

19:52.790 --> 19:54.030
you woman

19:54.720 --> 19:55.920
Why are you so rude?

19:56.400 --> 19:57.720
Then you stole my beads?

19:57.830 --> 19:59.070
Why don't you return the property to its original owner?

19:59.310 --> 20:00.790
You took my things

20:00.960 --> 20:02.310
I'll get it back based on my ability

20:02.510 --> 20:03.790
I take your stuff

20:04.200 --> 20:05.000
You can still do it

20:05.110 --> 20:06.110
Take it back based on your ability

20:08.030 --> 20:08.880
He Xiaowei

20:23.720 --> 20:25.310
What happened so late at night?

20:25.920 --> 20:26.680
He Xiaowei

20:26.790 --> 20:28.030
Our General Guo said

20:28.110 --> 20:29.920
There was supposed to be a banquet for guests tonight

20:30.160 --> 20:31.030
But it was delayed due to something

20:31.310 --> 20:32.510
This army is extremely crude

20:32.640 --> 20:33.590
Really poor hospitality

20:33.790 --> 20:35.110
I was specially ordered to deliver this snack

20:35.240 --> 20:36.240
Give He Xiaowei some food

20:36.680 --> 20:37.750
Thank you, General Guo Zhi

20:37.880 --> 20:38.350
Take the trouble

20:59.550 --> 21:00.000
Oops

21:07.640 --> 21:09.240
You said you are a little girl?

21:09.550 --> 21:11.240
Don't do embroidery properly in the boudoir

21:11.640 --> 21:13.000
He wants to get involved in military matters

21:13.640 --> 21:14.640
Just come if you come

21:15.030 --> 21:16.440
Still plotting against me at every turn

21:18.160 --> 21:18.550
you say

21:18.880 --> 21:20.160
I'm going to carry you now

21:20.270 --> 21:21.240
Throw it into the well

21:21.400 --> 21:21.880
Let you try it

21:21.960 --> 21:23.160
This crossbow is powerful

21:26.550 --> 21:27.480
want to talk

21:28.480 --> 21:29.110
Then you say it

21:32.310 --> 21:32.830
Can't say

21:33.200 --> 21:34.440
There are walnuts in your mouth, right?

21:36.480 --> 21:38.400
It's not impossible to talk if you want to

21:38.680 --> 21:39.590
But let’s talk first

21:40.160 --> 21:41.200
If I put the walnuts in your mouth

21:41.270 --> 21:41.510
take it out

21:41.640 --> 21:42.880
If you want to yell

21:43.030 --> 21:43.550
I'll let you taste it

21:43.680 --> 21:45.270
Your Cui family crossbow is very powerful

22:10.440 --> 22:12.110
There are organs in the mouth

22:25.310 --> 22:26.960
Is this needle poisonous?

22:27.640 --> 22:28.400
If you are not honest again

22:28.510 --> 22:29.790
I'll prick you with a needle

22:35.480 --> 22:37.240
Where are so many needles?

22:39.720 --> 22:41.110
Such a delicate thing

22:41.750 --> 22:42.240
Gave it to me

22:42.920 --> 22:44.440
Why are you not convinced?

22:44.510 --> 22:45.350
Stab you

22:47.640 --> 22:48.640
Just wait for me

22:54.440 --> 22:55.310
you two

22:55.440 --> 22:56.920
Lead a small group of troops respectively

22:57.070 --> 22:58.070
Send someone to inquire first

22:58.200 --> 22:59.510
What is their condition?

22:59.830 --> 23:00.720
If they had a snack

23:00.830 --> 23:01.510
Already unconscious

23:01.680 --> 23:03.070
That would be the best

23:03.200 --> 23:04.480
If they haven't been poisoned yet

23:04.830 --> 23:05.720
Get started now

23:06.160 --> 23:06.720
yes

23:07.790 --> 23:12.640
Laolan River Eighteen Bays

23:16.440 --> 23:17.720
General Pei

23:17.880 --> 23:19.270
Come to Guo Zhi's army

23:19.440 --> 23:20.350
Probably not sincere

23:20.480 --> 23:21.960
I want to have peace talks with Guo Zhi

23:22.270 --> 23:23.720
But he has other plans

23:25.440 --> 23:26.400
That being the case

23:26.830 --> 23:27.480
why not

23:27.550 --> 23:29.110
Open the skylight and speak frankly.

23:29.920 --> 23:31.550
Captain He is indeed a smart man

23:32.790 --> 23:33.680
only

23:33.960 --> 23:35.310
Who are you from the Cui family?

23:35.750 --> 23:36.590
Do you mean what you say?

23:36.880 --> 23:38.640
Little General Pei can take charge of things

23:38.880 --> 23:40.160
I can make the decision

23:40.550 --> 23:41.680
That's not a bad tone

23:42.030 --> 23:43.200
What's going on with your Cui family?

23:43.680 --> 23:44.590
You can do it for Mr. Cui

23:44.720 --> 23:45.350
Make the decision

23:45.480 --> 23:46.640
It will be all right

24:08.920 --> 24:10.110
There's a fire

24:11.880 --> 24:13.200
There's a fire

24:16.200 --> 24:18.160
It's bad to catch fire

24:18.240 --> 24:18.920
It's on fire. It's on fire. It's on fire.

24:18.920 --> 24:19.440
quick

24:24.200 --> 24:25.720
You should untie me first

24:26.550 --> 24:27.790
What did you deploy in advance?

24:27.920 --> 24:29.440
What else did you deploy?

24:30.480 --> 24:31.960
You are so scheming

24:32.070 --> 24:33.550
each other

24:43.110 --> 24:43.790
what are you doing

24:43.920 --> 24:44.240
kick

24:52.750 --> 24:53.830
It's not good. It's not good.

24:53.830 --> 24:55.110
The Zhenxi Army attacked the camp

24:55.240 --> 24:55.720
quick

24:56.720 --> 24:57.590
Quickly

24:57.750 --> 24:58.550
It's not good. It's not good.

24:58.590 --> 24:59.350
Attacked the camp

24:59.510 --> 25:00.480
The Zhenxi Army attacked the camp

25:00.830 --> 25:01.790
Attacked the camp

25:02.200 --> 25:02.920
The Zhenxi Army attacked the camp

25:03.790 --> 25:04.960
Zhenxi Army Attacks Camp

25:05.070 --> 25:07.310
Who framed us among these people?

25:12.000 --> 25:12.790
Bring more water

25:17.400 --> 25:18.550
Put out the fire quickly

25:33.920 --> 25:34.590
Thank you very much

25:34.880 --> 25:35.240
how do you know

25:35.310 --> 25:36.350
i can kill them

25:36.590 --> 25:37.310
You are so scheming

25:37.440 --> 25:38.350
one person

25:38.510 --> 25:39.110
Don’t hide it on your body

25:39.240 --> 25:40.830
Eight murder weapons out of ten

25:41.160 --> 25:42.480
I'm afraid I'll underestimate you

25:45.350 --> 25:48.880
Laolan River Eighteen Bays

25:53.510 --> 25:55.000
It's fun to set fire to it

25:56.350 --> 25:57.400
I watched you shoot an arrow

25:57.480 --> 25:58.790
It's quite fun to let it go.

26:00.030 --> 26:01.070
Then don't bother me

26:01.480 --> 26:02.200
Go on

26:08.510 --> 26:10.070
You keep going

26:23.550 --> 26:24.550
What is your plan?

26:24.790 --> 26:25.510
I have no plan

26:25.590 --> 26:26.680
I will follow you as you go

26:26.920 --> 26:27.270
You don't know how to draw a horse

26:27.350 --> 26:28.510
Not even prepared?

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
I thought you were ready

26:30.440 --> 26:31.830
Why are you so shameless?

26:31.920 --> 26:32.750
I just found out today

26:32.880 --> 26:33.590
It's too late

27:08.200 --> 27:08.880
Walk

27:12.030 --> 27:14.510
Be careful, the rocket is coming again

27:41.920 --> 27:42.240
careful

27:46.030 --> 27:46.550
quick

28:01.400 --> 28:01.880
my people

28:07.830 --> 28:08.440
You go back immediately

28:08.550 --> 28:09.000
Tell Pei Yuan

28:09.110 --> 28:09.920
things have changed

28:10.110 --> 28:11.550
Ask him to be sure to prevent Guo Zhi

28:11.680 --> 28:12.110
and Cui Jiajun

28:12.240 --> 28:13.590
Take advantage of the chaos to sneak attack on our Wangzhou City

28:13.880 --> 28:14.920
If Wangzhou City is lost

28:15.200 --> 28:16.400
Bingzhou City raised troops to attack again

28:16.510 --> 28:17.440
We will be passive

28:18.200 --> 28:19.200
Seventeen Lang, what about you?

28:19.310 --> 28:20.160
Food is in their hands

28:20.270 --> 28:21.030
I'll go after food

28:21.310 --> 28:21.750
quick

29:37.750 --> 29:39.160
I knew you would be fooled

29:45.750 --> 29:46.880
you just said

29:47.070 --> 29:48.640
It's the captain who ordered you to come back and report the news

29:49.270 --> 29:49.680
yes

29:50.510 --> 29:51.640
Ashu was derelict in his duty

29:52.720 --> 29:54.030
I've been running from pursuers

29:54.310 --> 29:54.790
After escaping

29:54.880 --> 29:56.160
Just came straight to the camp

29:56.680 --> 29:58.310
The captain said she would return to the camp after escaping.

29:58.680 --> 29:59.920
Sir, please follow the original plan

30:00.070 --> 30:01.400
Lead the army to attack Wangzhou

30:02.310 --> 30:02.880
Send an order

30:03.240 --> 30:03.920
strike camp

30:04.200 --> 30:06.110
The army went all out to search for Lieutenant He

30:06.440 --> 30:07.030
Young Master

30:07.160 --> 30:08.110
The captain said

30:08.400 --> 30:09.750
Wangzhou City is now on an unstable footing.

30:09.880 --> 30:10.590
leaderless

30:10.720 --> 30:11.880
Just the right opportunity

30:12.240 --> 30:13.680
Did the young master follow the original plan?

30:13.790 --> 30:15.030
Lead an army to attack Wangzhou

30:15.200 --> 30:16.400
If it is because of the attack on Wangzhou

30:16.510 --> 30:17.720
wasted the opportunity

30:17.960 --> 30:19.400
Did the captain make any mistakes?

30:19.480 --> 30:21.160
I will only regret it

30:22.720 --> 30:23.350
Young Master

30:24.000 --> 30:25.350
Since the captain has arranged it like this

30:25.720 --> 30:26.790
There must be some certainty

30:27.200 --> 30:28.440
Just pretend it's nothing

30:29.070 --> 30:29.550
Ashu

30:30.200 --> 30:31.240
You don't have to persuade me anymore

30:31.680 --> 30:32.400
Send an order

30:32.830 --> 30:33.790
Break camp immediately

30:36.310 --> 30:36.790
yes

30:41.550 --> 30:43.000
Don't be in a hurry and eat slowly

30:48.070 --> 30:49.440
It's okay, General Pei

30:49.920 --> 30:50.880
I am full

30:51.200 --> 30:52.270
Seventeen Lang emphasized again and again

30:52.440 --> 30:52.960
Let you be careful

30:53.030 --> 30:54.400
Cui Jiajun and Guo Zhi

30:54.510 --> 30:55.720
Take advantage of the chaos to attack Wangzhou City

30:56.440 --> 30:57.270
Then I'll leave the city first

30:57.440 --> 30:58.070
Go and pick up Shichiro

30:58.160 --> 30:58.550
OK

30:58.960 --> 30:59.880
When you meet Shichiro

31:00.000 --> 31:00.720
tell him

31:00.790 --> 31:01.510
reassure him

31:01.830 --> 31:03.030
I will definitely think of something

31:03.160 --> 31:04.110
To protect Wangzhou City

31:04.200 --> 31:04.590
good

31:35.830 --> 31:36.550
You're not going in that direction

31:36.680 --> 31:37.680
Did you chase him?

31:38.160 --> 31:39.550
I am a person who has a clear distinction between grudges and grudges.

31:39.680 --> 31:40.480
an eye for an eye

31:40.750 --> 31:41.680
Bastard

31:41.790 --> 31:43.200
Last time you kicked me into a well

31:43.400 --> 31:44.680
I didn't even scold you.

31:46.640 --> 31:47.350
Help

31:49.200 --> 31:50.790
Okay, little liar

31:50.880 --> 31:51.510
have you forgotten

31:51.590 --> 31:52.400
when we first met

31:52.400 --> 31:53.510
It's in the water

31:53.720 --> 31:55.350
You are very good at water, I remember

31:55.750 --> 31:57.240
My legs are cramped

31:58.070 --> 31:58.510
Help

31:58.640 --> 31:59.510
Someone like you

31:59.590 --> 32:00.960
You should learn a lesson

32:01.070 --> 32:01.880
Help

32:09.400 --> 32:10.350
little liar

32:16.750 --> 32:17.830
What if you don’t come out again?

32:18.240 --> 32:20.070
I'll take your horse away

32:22.440 --> 32:23.350
I'm really gone

32:50.070 --> 32:50.880
wake up wake up

33:06.640 --> 33:08.030
call me little liar

33:08.200 --> 33:09.510
And kicked me into the river

33:09.830 --> 33:10.720
I won't call you today

33:10.790 --> 33:12.000
Go and take a dip in the cold water in this river

33:12.110 --> 33:13.830
You call me a little liar in vain

33:20.240 --> 33:20.720
never mind

33:21.160 --> 33:21.720
See if you go to the river

33:21.830 --> 33:22.960
For saving my sake

33:23.270 --> 33:24.480
Let me help you one more time

33:24.680 --> 33:26.000
To prevent the pursuers from coming over

33:26.110 --> 33:27.550
I'll cut you off with one knife

35:00.800 --> 35:02.030
Xiaobai, run quickly

35:24.150 --> 35:26.000
Xiaobai, go quickly

35:27.480 --> 35:28.670
Go back and find someone

36:20.320 --> 36:21.630
so hungry

36:21.920 --> 36:23.070
I didn’t bring any dry food with me either.

36:23.190 --> 36:24.110
What a mistake

36:28.710 --> 36:30.480
Do you want to eat rabbit meat?

36:32.150 --> 36:33.440
It's you

36:33.550 --> 36:35.150
yes it's me

36:37.440 --> 36:38.710
The anesthetic on your needle

36:38.840 --> 36:39.760
Really awesome

36:39.920 --> 36:41.550
Let me sleep until late and then wake up

36:42.110 --> 36:43.030
I'll take a look when I wake up

36:43.150 --> 36:44.150
The horse is gone too

36:44.440 --> 36:45.550
You ran away too

36:47.480 --> 36:48.480
You said I worked so hard

36:48.550 --> 36:49.550
I walked for more than two hours

36:49.630 --> 36:50.320
walk here

36:51.070 --> 36:51.920
God has eyes

36:52.000 --> 36:53.400
Let me meet you here

36:54.070 --> 36:54.670
I knew it

36:54.800 --> 36:56.000
You are such a vicious person

36:56.110 --> 36:57.630
Only then could such a trap be designed.

36:57.760 --> 36:59.230
You are too good at wronging me, right?

36:59.440 --> 37:00.590
This is obviously a hunter hunting a bear

37:00.670 --> 37:01.710
hunting hole

37:01.880 --> 37:03.320
Look how deep the hole is dug

37:03.440 --> 37:04.960
You know it’s not a day’s work

37:05.030 --> 37:07.070
Did you see a wasp just now?

37:07.400 --> 37:08.400
So what

37:08.590 --> 37:09.510
Isn't this right?

37:09.710 --> 37:11.030
There are many bears in this mountain

37:11.150 --> 37:12.960
bear skin bear bile bear paw

37:13.070 --> 37:14.190
All are rare treasures

37:14.320 --> 37:15.550
Can be sold at a high price

37:15.710 --> 37:16.960
But hunting bears is extremely difficult

37:17.030 --> 37:17.590
But what about the bear?

37:17.670 --> 37:18.920
Love to eat mountain honey again

37:19.230 --> 37:20.070
So hunters are generally

37:20.190 --> 37:21.440
Will choose a place with honeycombs

37:21.550 --> 37:22.760
Set up such a trap

37:23.230 --> 37:24.630
It's just that the hunter didn't think of it

37:24.760 --> 37:26.150
I haven't hunted this bear yet.

37:26.280 --> 37:27.880
Little liar caught

37:33.960 --> 37:34.760
It smells so good

37:36.480 --> 37:37.880
How about we make a deal?

37:38.360 --> 37:39.000
And me

37:39.280 --> 37:40.400
Please eat rabbit legs

37:40.630 --> 37:41.150
And you

37:41.280 --> 37:42.150
Give me back the rations

37:42.280 --> 37:44.230
What do you mean by returning the military rations to you?

37:44.510 --> 37:45.280
That was obviously my trick

37:45.360 --> 37:46.710
Earned military rations

37:47.150 --> 37:48.280
It smells so good

37:54.190 --> 37:55.000
So delicious

37:55.590 --> 37:56.880
How about I make a deal with you?

37:57.280 --> 37:57.920
Where's the rabbit?

37:58.030 --> 37:59.320
There are four legs in total

37:59.760 --> 38:00.710
You won't let me put these four legs

38:00.840 --> 38:02.070
Eat them all

38:07.760 --> 38:08.440
He Xiaowei

38:08.840 --> 38:09.800
You have been there day and night

38:09.880 --> 38:11.110
Nothing to eat

38:11.550 --> 38:13.400
When I just roasted this rabbit

38:14.550 --> 38:16.630
The sizzling meat is dripping with oil.

38:16.760 --> 38:18.510
Do you know how fragrant it is?

38:20.190 --> 38:21.070
Tell you

38:21.400 --> 38:22.960
As long as you give me the military rations quickly

38:23.070 --> 38:23.590
And me

38:24.110 --> 38:25.800
I'll treat you to rabbit meat

38:33.550 --> 38:34.190
OK

38:34.710 --> 38:35.880
Since we want to talk

38:36.230 --> 38:37.510
There has to be some sincerity.

38:37.800 --> 38:38.880
You rescue me first

38:39.030 --> 38:39.840
Then I gave the army rations

38:39.960 --> 38:40.710
Give you half

38:40.840 --> 38:42.230
But this half of the army rations

38:42.360 --> 38:43.440
I have to wait until you escort me there

38:43.590 --> 38:44.920
After Cui Jiajun’s camp

38:45.030 --> 38:46.030
I can give it to you

38:47.590 --> 38:48.670
you little liar

38:48.960 --> 38:50.510
You think I'm a little fool, right?

38:50.800 --> 38:51.320
Say it

38:51.630 --> 38:52.960
How many of those bamboo tubes do you have on your body?

38:53.110 --> 38:54.320
How many of those poisonous needles are there?

38:54.480 --> 38:55.920
Why are you scared?

38:56.320 --> 38:57.800
Then don't save me from going out

38:57.920 --> 38:58.550
You go

38:59.190 --> 39:00.710
Let me die here alone

39:01.000 --> 39:02.150
Your military rations are gone too

39:02.440 --> 39:03.030
look back

39:03.150 --> 39:03.920
Waiting for our young master

39:04.070 --> 39:05.190
know about my death

39:05.320 --> 39:06.360
Will definitely be angry

39:07.110 --> 39:08.710
He will come to avenge me

39:09.000 --> 39:09.440
OK

39:10.440 --> 39:11.440
That being the case

39:11.760 --> 39:13.030
Then I will come down to accompany you

39:15.400 --> 39:16.110
you are crazy

39:16.400 --> 39:17.440
I'm the only one in there

39:17.550 --> 39:18.510
Can you still save me?

39:18.630 --> 39:19.630
Now you come down too

39:19.710 --> 39:20.920
How do we two get up there?

39:21.070 --> 39:22.070
Thanks to you

39:22.510 --> 39:23.550
I've been in the well too

39:23.670 --> 39:24.550
I've been in the river too

39:24.760 --> 39:26.030
You said we are so destined

39:26.230 --> 39:26.920
You've all fallen into a trap

39:27.110 --> 39:27.480
Can I come down?

39:27.590 --> 39:28.840
Will I live and die with you?

39:29.110 --> 39:30.710
Frivolous and dissolute

39:35.800 --> 39:37.630
You scolded me twice today

39:37.880 --> 39:39.230
I'm a very vindictive person

39:39.590 --> 39:40.110
I originally wanted to give it to you

39:40.230 --> 39:41.320
Two rabbit legs

39:41.510 --> 39:42.070
But you scolded me once

39:42.190 --> 39:43.150
I'll give you one less

39:43.280 --> 39:44.280
You scolded me twice today

39:44.320 --> 39:45.590
You haven't eaten a single thing

39:45.710 --> 39:46.840
You can only watch me eat

39:55.960 --> 39:56.550
So fragrant

40:07.190 --> 40:08.150
me

40:08.480 --> 40:09.920
Very clear-cut

40:10.670 --> 40:12.920
Even though you stung me with a needle and knocked me out

40:13.070 --> 40:13.960
But before you leave

40:14.070 --> 40:15.630
He piled straw on me out of kindness

40:16.280 --> 40:17.190
One yard owned by a yard

40:20.920 --> 40:22.190
hurry up

40:29.710 --> 40:31.110
how about my craft

40:32.800 --> 40:33.920
It's well roasted

40:34.800 --> 40:35.190
Can you

40:35.320 --> 40:36.510
tell me honestly

40:36.670 --> 40:38.440
How on earth are we two going to get there?

40:40.110 --> 40:41.320
how do you know

40:41.480 --> 40:42.800
I have a way to get up there

40:44.590 --> 40:45.920
Even though I’ve known you not long ago

40:46.110 --> 40:48.480
But you are a cunning person

40:48.630 --> 40:50.630
How can you do something that is impossible to do?

40:51.000 --> 40:52.230
Since you can come down

40:52.360 --> 40:53.710
There must be a way to get up there

40:54.960 --> 40:56.630
You think so highly of me

40:56.760 --> 40:57.920
You said so

40:58.030 --> 40:59.000
Let me tell you the truth

40:59.190 --> 41:00.190
Where am I tonight?

41:00.440 --> 41:01.710
Not planning to go up

41:02.840 --> 41:03.400
What

41:05.230 --> 41:06.510
It’s all so dark

41:06.880 --> 41:08.190
This deep mountain and dense forest

41:08.480 --> 41:09.630
Who knows except the bear

41:09.760 --> 41:10.840
What other beasts are there?

41:10.960 --> 41:11.480
Suddenly another one

41:11.590 --> 41:12.630
Tigers, leopards, etc.

41:12.710 --> 41:14.190
Wouldn't that be all over?

41:14.960 --> 41:15.630
I know

41:15.760 --> 41:16.670
You have powder on you

41:16.800 --> 41:17.550
Snakes and ants do not invade

41:17.710 --> 41:18.840
But those beasts

41:18.960 --> 41:20.320
I'm not afraid of your powder

41:21.320 --> 41:21.960
so what

41:22.070 --> 41:22.840
listen to me

41:22.960 --> 41:24.400
Just take a nap here

41:24.510 --> 41:25.280
Tomorrow morning

41:25.360 --> 41:27.230
I shall take Captain He hostage

41:27.360 --> 41:29.440
Go to your Cui family army in exchange for military rations

41:31.480 --> 41:32.800
Such a shameless trick

41:32.960 --> 41:34.440
And he said it so confidently

41:34.550 --> 41:35.880
Don't we have each other?

41:45.400 --> 41:46.070
somebody is coming

41:46.440 --> 41:47.510
You said it yourself

41:47.840 --> 41:50.000
Wild beasts roaming deep in the mountains and forests

41:50.110 --> 41:51.030
Where did this person come from?

41:54.760 --> 41:56.000
Quick, quick, quick, quick

41:56.110 --> 41:56.480
Got it

41:56.590 --> 41:57.230
Hurry up

41:57.280 --> 41:57.800
There must be good stuff

41:58.000 --> 41:58.440
that is

41:58.550 --> 41:58.920
Go quickly

42:00.480 --> 42:01.590
There must be good stuff

42:01.710 --> 42:02.510
Listen to me

42:02.840 --> 42:03.440
Take a look at me

42:03.480 --> 42:03.710
what

42:03.840 --> 42:04.550
Come and see

42:05.360 --> 42:06.710
I can't see clearly, that's wrong

42:06.960 --> 42:08.070
How can this be a human being?

42:08.190 --> 42:09.070
It's two people

42:09.230 --> 42:09.880
It's two people
