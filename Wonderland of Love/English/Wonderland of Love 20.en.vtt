01:43.179 --> 01:44.339
Do you think that

01:44.340 --> 01:46.499
Can you make Mr. Qin change his mind?

01:47.579 --> 01:49.180
Mr Qin,

01:49.219 --> 01:50.820
despite being strong,
he has a soft heart.

01:51.099 --> 01:53.458
Others look at him as
on countless battlefields,

01:53.459 --> 01:54.899
on countless battlefields.

01:54.939 --> 01:57.899
In fact, he is very kind,

01:57.939 --> 01:59.419
and nice.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.100
With the right words,

02:01.219 --> 02:03.300
I'm sure I can change his mind.

02:03.659 --> 02:06.298
His Majesty ordered Lord Qin
to reflect on his mistakes.

02:06.299 --> 02:09.259
The master said that many people
a letter of complaint

02:09.260 --> 02:11.260
from Mr. Qin, right?

02:11.499 --> 02:14.659
When the tree is tall and strong,
the wind will blow it.

02:15.140 --> 02:15.819
Lord Qin

02:15.820 --> 02:17.338
did a great feat this time.

02:17.339 --> 02:19.460
So others are jealous of him.

02:21.100 --> 02:23.499
Now His Majesty is angry.

02:23.820 --> 02:26.339
If Lord Qin refuses to bow to him,

02:26.700 --> 02:29.779
I fear they
among them.

02:30.660 --> 02:32.939
And this will greatly affect
Lord Qin's future.

02:36.299 --> 02:37.898
Greetings, Lord Qin.

02:37.899 --> 02:38.980
Srta. GU,

02:39.820 --> 02:42.298
I should have
visited Prime Minister Gu in person.

02:42.299 --> 02:43.899
But I can't just
leave the house.

02:44.100 --> 02:45.778
When you return,

02:45.779 --> 02:47.099
apologize for me.

02:47.420 --> 02:48.740
He's very polite.

02:49.019 --> 02:50.498
Actually, I didn't come today

02:50.499 --> 02:52.058
to defend my father.

02:52.059 --> 02:54.020
Today I came of my own free will.

02:56.420 --> 02:57.819
I have something

02:57.820 --> 02:59.339
to give you.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.260
Miss. GU is very friendly.

03:01.579 --> 03:03.139
I have everything I need.

03:03.140 --> 03:04.980
How can I accept a gift from you?

03:11.459 --> 03:13.619
This was embroidered by me.

03:13.660 --> 03:15.740
When I was in the capital,
with my old friends.

03:15.820 --> 03:17.738
Fortunately, some people

03:17.739 --> 03:19.619
they saw their biological mother.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.540
So I embroidered

03:21.660 --> 03:23.498
I made this portrait of Mrs. Liu

03:23.499 --> 03:25.779
According to the description.

03:26.260 --> 03:27.578
After finishing,

03:27.579 --> 03:28.659
I showed everyone that

03:28.660 --> 03:29.619
who knew Ms. Liu.

03:29.620 --> 03:31.460
I heard this portrait
is just like her.

03:31.660 --> 03:32.458
Lord Qin.

03:32.459 --> 03:34.139
Miss. GU took too long

03:34.140 --> 03:35.539
to look for people

03:35.540 --> 03:37.298
who have seen Ms. Liu.

03:37.299 --> 03:38.699
She also asked them to

03:38.700 --> 03:40.260
to describe Ms. Liu to her.

03:40.380 --> 03:41.778
So she made a sketch

03:41.779 --> 03:42.939
and worked on this portrait

03:42.940 --> 03:44.699
until your eyes were red

03:44.700 --> 03:46.379
until his eyes were red.

03:46.380 --> 03:48.980
Finally managed
to finish this portrait on time.

03:57.100 --> 03:58.140
Your Highness.

03:58.260 --> 03:59.618
It's really sad

03:59.619 --> 04:01.498
not grow

04:01.499 --> 04:03.219
grow up under the care of a mother.

04:03.619 --> 04:05.860
But Madam Liu

04:05.980 --> 04:08.498
you will find it very good

04:08.499 --> 04:10.180
you are so brave and capable.

04:11.860 --> 04:13.300
Thank you, Miss. GU.

04:14.940 --> 04:16.099
So I will accept

04:17.340 --> 04:18.579
this painting.

04:20.379 --> 04:23.019
You are an intelligent
and understanding person.

04:23.179 --> 04:24.298
You must know that

04:24.299 --> 04:26.138
Ms. Liu wouldn't like it

04:26.139 --> 04:27.698
because of his title,

04:27.699 --> 04:29.540
because of her.

04:35.379 --> 04:36.618
Look, Your Highness.

04:36.619 --> 04:37.738
I bordei is retrato

04:37.739 --> 04:39.619
to embroider this painting.

04:39.739 --> 04:42.019
If you want to hang her painting

04:42.020 --> 04:43.298
to be used for memorial purposes,

04:43.299 --> 04:44.019
the color will not fade

04:44.020 --> 04:46.220
it won't disappear
it won't disappear.

04:49.020 --> 04:51.180
Miss. GU is so attentive.

04:51.699 --> 04:54.220
Thank you very much.

04:54.699 --> 04:56.220
The princess is very nice

04:57.299 --> 04:58.378
I know that

04:58.379 --> 05:00.019
You can't have a guest here
for long.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.540
I'm leaving.

05:20.580 --> 05:21.698
Miss,

05:21.699 --> 05:23.579
Don't you want
to convince Mr. Qin

05:23.580 --> 05:25.259
to apologize to Her Majesty.

05:25.460 --> 05:27.178
Why don't you say anything?

05:27.179 --> 05:29.300
And he left in a hurry.

05:31.179 --> 05:33.100
I messed up.

05:33.540 --> 05:35.899
Mister Qin takes the title

05:35.900 --> 05:37.420
It is serious.

05:38.540 --> 05:40.819
Right now, seeing his expression,

05:40.900 --> 05:42.859
if I change his mind,

05:42.860 --> 05:44.740
he would be unhappy.

05:45.259 --> 05:46.300
And also,

05:46.340 --> 05:48.780
the portrait of Lady Liu.

05:49.259 --> 05:51.420
And every time he
portrays it,

05:51.460 --> 05:53.740
he will thank me.

05:54.139 --> 05:55.740
Since I got what I wanted,

05:55.900 --> 05:57.860
I can't be better than him.

05:58.379 --> 05:59.738
Will he really give up

05:59.739 --> 06:01.420
of Lord Qin's position?

06:01.619 --> 06:04.619
Will the king punish him again?

06:05.980 --> 06:07.660
He is the chosen king.

06:07.780 --> 06:10.059
Everything will go well for him.

06:10.780 --> 06:12.459
For someone like Lord Qin,

06:12.460 --> 06:13.779
others

06:13.780 --> 06:15.819
Maybe they can beat him in this fight,

06:16.020 --> 06:18.259
but they can't win
the game.

06:26.699 --> 06:27.780
You are back.

06:28.540 --> 06:29.660
I went back.

06:31.819 --> 06:33.178
Do not look at me.

06:33.179 --> 06:34.579
She did not respond to his letter.

06:34.580 --> 06:36.699
She didn't even open her letter.

06:36.860 --> 06:38.540
I won't wait for her answer.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.818
But to be honest,

06:44.819 --> 06:47.378
what did Miss Cui say

06:47.379 --> 06:49.180
you're right.

06:49.379 --> 06:51.058
She said that in the current situation,

06:51.059 --> 06:52.899
you should think we are at war.

06:52.900 --> 06:54.298
When will you attack?

06:54.299 --> 06:55.419
And when

06:55.420 --> 06:56.899
stop and regroup?

06:56.900 --> 06:57.698
In truth,

06:57.699 --> 06:59.619
you know what to do.

07:03.739 --> 07:04.860
What is that?

07:10.179 --> 07:11.860
It's my mother's portrait.

07:12.499 --> 07:15.499
They say this portrait
is just like her.

07:16.699 --> 07:18.059
I've never seen her before.

07:19.660 --> 07:21.220
This painting

07:21.340 --> 07:23.180
It is well embroidered.

07:23.619 --> 07:25.740
It almost looks real.

07:26.100 --> 07:26.939
Sim.

07:27.179 --> 07:28.320
Miss. GU sent.

07:28.320 --> 07:30.080
She said
for a long time.

07:30.220 --> 07:31.780
It's from Miss. GU?

07:33.499 --> 07:35.258
It seems that Miss GU

07:35.259 --> 07:36.939
cares a lot about you.

07:37.139 --> 07:38.339
Shiqi,

07:38.340 --> 07:39.899
Is she interested in you?

07:39.900 --> 07:40.539
She and I

07:40.540 --> 07:42.100
we are totally different people.

07:42.179 --> 07:43.660
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

07:44.059 --> 07:45.100
Eu

07:46.020 --> 07:47.819
at Miss Cui.

07:49.340 --> 07:51.019
Miss Cui

07:51.340 --> 07:53.019
Haven't read your letter yet.

08:10.660 --> 08:12.420
Is the governor of Biandu better?

08:12.780 --> 08:14.119
The doctor said acupuncture was used

08:14.119 --> 08:15.720
it is neutralizing the poison.
A secret medicine.

08:15.720 --> 08:18.220
He said the poison has already been neutralized
.

08:18.379 --> 08:19.220
This poison

08:19.619 --> 08:21.499
For a long time.

08:25.819 --> 08:26.780
Governor.

08:28.139 --> 08:30.619
Governor.

08:31.020 --> 08:31.900
Governor.

08:34.419 --> 08:36.620
(Qingyun Temple)
At that time, I promised Lord Qin

08:37.340 --> 08:41.378
if he swore to protect
the imperial great-grandson

08:41.379 --> 08:43.099
and put him on the throne,

08:43.499 --> 08:47.219
I would find a way
to poison Sun Jing.

08:47.779 --> 08:49.179
I was also prepared

08:49.180 --> 08:51.180
to die with him.

08:52.340 --> 08:53.900
But I never thought that

08:54.539 --> 08:56.500
that would fail.

08:57.100 --> 08:59.579
And he still fled to Tong Pass.

09:00.659 --> 09:02.540
I couldn't keep
my promise.

09:03.619 --> 09:04.498
Duque.

09:04.499 --> 09:06.140
You did your best.

09:06.659 --> 09:08.900
It was all in the hands of the gods.

09:11.779 --> 09:13.979
Lord Qin sent me a letter yesterday.

09:14.259 --> 09:16.459
He wrote that although Sun Jing
was defeated now,

09:16.580 --> 09:18.780
the threat remained unbreakable.

09:19.300 --> 09:21.540
We still have to be cautious.

09:22.259 --> 09:24.418
Write a letter to General Han

09:24.419 --> 09:27.258
for him to keep
keep hidden

09:27.259 --> 09:29.420
for now.

09:29.899 --> 09:30.859
Sim.

09:43.779 --> 09:44.780
Your Highness.

09:45.340 --> 09:48.459
We have a letter from Consort Xiao.

09:48.980 --> 09:50.459
How is my mother?

09:50.460 --> 09:52.498
Lord Qin claimed Xichang

09:52.499 --> 09:54.299
but I didn't receive
my mother.

09:54.300 --> 09:55.859
I was worried

09:55.860 --> 09:57.459
something had happened to her.

09:57.460 --> 09:58.778
Don't worry,

09:58.779 --> 10:00.300
Concubine Xiao is alive and well.

10:00.659 --> 10:01.579
She has

10:01.580 --> 10:03.300
No Templo Qingyun

10:03.379 --> 10:04.378
no Templo Qingyun.

10:04.379 --> 10:05.898
Since the capital
Biandu has been restored,

10:05.899 --> 10:08.059
Can we go back to the city?

10:13.860 --> 10:15.099
Your Highness.

10:15.779 --> 10:17.699
Consort Xiao sent us a letter

10:17.860 --> 10:20.059
to make us bear this
for a while longer.

10:21.100 --> 10:23.339
What can we trust

10:23.739 --> 10:25.020
we can trust

10:25.259 --> 10:27.140
with Lord Qin in the capital.

10:27.539 --> 10:29.898
But Lord Xin and Lord Qi

10:29.899 --> 10:31.699
have great ambitions.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.699
A concubina Xiao

10:34.820 --> 10:37.140
asked us
to hide.

10:37.419 --> 10:39.059
I fear there are still many

10:39.460 --> 10:41.540
who want to hurt you.

10:42.300 --> 10:43.699
I know.

10:46.139 --> 10:48.299
Does Lord Xin want to lead the Zhenxi army
to Changzhou?

10:48.300 --> 10:49.459
Sim.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.059
During today's court meeting,

10:51.060 --> 10:51.898
my father asked me to

10:51.899 --> 10:53.258
to lead our army to Changzhou

10:53.259 --> 10:55.258
to stop Sun Jing from summoning
to stop Sun Jing from summoning.

10:55.259 --> 10:57.099
And Lord Xin volunteered
to lead the army.

10:57.100 --> 11:01.059
And the pedantic ministers said that
since the founding of this country,

11:01.060 --> 11:03.440
Since the founding of this country,
it has always been in the hands of you.

11:03.440 --> 11:04.339
Therefore, they agreed that

11:04.340 --> 11:06.658
It is better to
let Lord Xin lead the army.

11:06.659 --> 11:08.420
How ridiculous.

11:09.580 --> 11:11.300
Have they forgotten how he lost Luoyang?

11:11.539 --> 11:13.059
If he leads the army,

11:13.259 --> 11:15.459
It's like sending the Zhenxi army
on a suicide mission.

11:16.180 --> 11:17.099
Furthermore,

11:17.100 --> 11:18.819
he involved Lord Qi in this.

11:18.820 --> 11:20.219
He said Mr. Qi can help you

11:20.220 --> 11:21.500
to help him.

11:21.659 --> 11:22.579
No final,

11:22.580 --> 11:24.500
they almost succeeded
in persuading the emperor

11:25.019 --> 11:26.300
Has the emperor already ordered?

11:26.499 --> 11:27.699
And still not

11:27.700 --> 11:28.859
to the Palace Secretariat.

11:29.300 --> 11:30.538
But the position of the emperor

11:30.539 --> 11:32.018
the position of the king.

11:32.019 --> 11:34.059
He will appoint Lord Qin
as the Commander-in-Chief,

11:34.060 --> 11:35.378
Lord Qi as general

11:35.379 --> 11:36.378
and me as vanguard.

11:36.379 --> 11:37.018
All three soldiers

11:37.019 --> 11:38.939
go to Changzhou
go to Changzhou

11:51.499 --> 11:54.660
Lord Xin is trying
to kill two birds with one stone

11:55.100 --> 11:57.420
He wants to stay in Changzhou
to wait until his opponent wears out.

11:58.419 --> 11:59.059
If he can

11:59.060 --> 12:00.819
the Jing troops that were sent to Baiyue,

12:00.820 --> 12:02.300
he can achieve a great feat.

12:02.499 --> 12:03.380
Second,

12:04.139 --> 12:06.579
he wants to seize the military power
of the Zhenxi army.

12:07.499 --> 12:09.300
My father also said that.

12:09.499 --> 12:10.618
My father also said that

12:10.619 --> 12:12.498
that Lord Xin is always looking
is already looking

12:12.499 --> 12:13.819
It's been a while.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.418
But he hasn't achieved anything yet.

12:15.419 --> 12:16.498
In terms of reputation,

12:16.499 --> 12:18.498
he cannot be compared to you.

12:18.499 --> 12:20.459
That's why he's looking forward to

12:20.499 --> 12:23.339
he wants to reach Changzhou.

12:24.139 --> 12:26.179
As tropes de Sun Jing para Baiyue

12:26.180 --> 12:28.339
It is made up of
battle-experienced veterans.

12:28.820 --> 12:30.380
Although they are tired,

12:30.659 --> 12:32.739
but it doesn't mean
being easily defeated.

12:32.860 --> 12:36.459
Lord Xin is arrogant and frantic,
he doesn't know how to lead troops.

12:36.460 --> 12:37.699
O Sr. Qi

12:38.779 --> 12:40.819
He's a little smart,
but he doesn't have enough courage.

12:41.499 --> 12:43.180
They can't fight together,

12:43.539 --> 12:45.339
win a battle together,

12:45.940 --> 12:47.418
their incompetence

12:47.419 --> 12:48.939
it will only lead the army to death.

12:50.980 --> 12:51.898
Maybe.

12:51.899 --> 12:53.219
Come, bite.

12:53.220 --> 12:56.020
Bite, bite.
- My God.

12:56.619 --> 12:57.660
Majesty.

12:58.860 --> 13:00.099
What it was?

13:00.100 --> 13:00.819
Skirt.

13:00.820 --> 13:01.780
Your Majesty.

13:02.379 --> 13:04.778
Mister Qin wrote you a letter.

13:04.779 --> 13:05.939
Please take a look

13:07.259 --> 13:09.658
I let him reflect
on his crimes, right?

13:09.659 --> 13:10.258
He knows

13:10.259 --> 13:11.979
what did he do wrong?

13:12.899 --> 13:14.339
Why are you writing me a letter?

13:14.340 --> 13:15.378
I won't read it.

13:15.379 --> 13:16.378
Take him away.

13:16.379 --> 13:16.939
Pai,

13:16.940 --> 13:18.418
Why don't you read it?

13:18.419 --> 13:19.018
See Li Ni

13:19.019 --> 13:20.498
ask for absurd things,

13:20.499 --> 13:22.180
you can reject it.

13:35.846 --> 13:39.046
(Letter to the Emperor)

13:40.499 --> 13:42.260
I've been thinking
about it all day.

13:42.460 --> 13:44.059
Plus, I can't sleep
well.

13:44.619 --> 13:46.260
I fought with you

13:46.300 --> 13:47.939
By my mother's title.

13:49.460 --> 13:50.900
She has already passed away

13:51.499 --> 13:53.059
and as your son,

13:53.220 --> 13:54.819
while she was alive,
while she was alive.

13:55.019 --> 13:56.739
Now I'm sad that
♪ She passed away.

13:57.060 --> 13:58.939
She will live forever in my heart.

13:59.700 --> 14:02.140
The other ministers feel sorry for me

14:02.659 --> 14:04.140
and considered my statement

14:04.419 --> 14:05.939
as an act of filial love.

14:07.139 --> 14:09.699
But the etiquette ritual

14:10.499 --> 14:12.720
It's to give to my mother
for my mother.

14:12.739 --> 14:14.859
I dare not disagree.

14:18.820 --> 14:20.660
I will respect
what you took.

14:29.239 --> 14:32.498
I will respect
I will respect.

14:32.499 --> 14:34.020
I have already sent a letter to the emperor

14:34.060 --> 14:36.140
to give to my mother
to calm the argument

14:36.300 --> 14:37.699
to calm the discussion.

14:38.139 --> 14:39.939
I believe the emperor
the imperial decree

14:40.100 --> 14:41.699
within the next few years.

14:42.899 --> 14:43.699
Your Highness,

14:43.700 --> 14:45.219
when you come back,

14:45.220 --> 14:46.660
Please, ask

14:47.460 --> 14:48.579
Prime Minister Gu

14:48.619 --> 14:50.939
to deliver the Ministry of Rites
to the tomb

14:50.940 --> 14:52.859
to deal with
of the late empress.

14:53.139 --> 14:54.660
You are...

14:56.580 --> 14:58.258
This wedding ceremony

14:58.259 --> 14:59.979
can lead this ceremony.

14:59.980 --> 15:02.658
Lord Xin won't want
Lord Xin won't want

15:02.659 --> 15:04.339
the prince.

15:04.700 --> 15:05.939
To speak the truth,

15:06.180 --> 15:07.658
I don't want to leave Lord Xin and Lord Qi

15:07.659 --> 15:09.180
lead the army to Changzhou.

15:09.899 --> 15:10.859
Understood.

15:11.220 --> 15:12.778
I will pass your message

15:12.779 --> 15:14.140
for my father.

15:25.539 --> 15:26.579
Pai,

15:26.700 --> 15:28.738
what Li Ni wrote

15:28.739 --> 15:30.459
in your letter?

15:30.580 --> 15:33.699
He said he did
n't want to harm me.

15:33.700 --> 15:34.579
So he asked me

15:34.580 --> 15:38.099
to give to the mother
to check on the mother.

15:38.820 --> 15:41.339
At first, he would rather give up
Lord Qin's throne

15:41.340 --> 15:43.219
because of his mother's title.

15:43.220 --> 15:45.459
And he embarrassed the Lady
during the court meeting.

15:45.460 --> 15:47.179
Why did he write an apology letter

15:47.180 --> 15:48.699
write you an apology letter?

15:49.700 --> 15:51.500
That's why,

15:51.980 --> 15:54.780
to warn others,
to warn others.

15:54.940 --> 15:55.979
Look.

15:56.019 --> 15:58.179
By asking him,
to reflect on his mistakes.

15:58.180 --> 15:59.900
To reflect on your mistakes.

16:01.460 --> 16:02.738
Li Ni may have been left with

16:02.739 --> 16:04.498
You may be sorry.

16:04.499 --> 16:05.739
But maybe

16:05.940 --> 16:08.180
He still has a grudge against you.

16:09.139 --> 16:11.498
As he has already admitted
his mistakes,

16:11.499 --> 16:13.898
I think
it's better to check

16:13.899 --> 16:15.219
to Mother.

16:15.779 --> 16:17.099
After all, you and Lai's mother

16:17.100 --> 16:18.898
They are the Empress.

16:18.899 --> 16:21.699
The ministers were also right.

16:21.700 --> 16:23.819
I only have three children.

16:23.820 --> 16:25.138
Just his mother

16:25.139 --> 16:27.819
received the title of
a goddess.

16:29.060 --> 16:31.660
It's really not appropriate.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.738
He already wrote this letter of apology

16:34.739 --> 16:35.658
right now,

16:35.659 --> 16:37.459
only for

16:37.460 --> 16:39.380
lead the army to Changzhou.

16:39.539 --> 16:40.778
If, as soon as he admits his mistakes,

16:40.779 --> 16:42.418
if you let him lead the army

16:42.419 --> 16:44.898
he will become even more arrogant.

16:44.899 --> 16:46.618
If you do,

16:46.619 --> 16:49.819
he will not be afraid
or respect you.

16:49.820 --> 16:51.138
Don't worry,

16:51.139 --> 16:53.780
since it is effective
to reflect on your mistakes,

16:54.019 --> 16:54.979
I will leave it

16:54.980 --> 16:58.059
for a while longer.

17:00.739 --> 17:01.780
Mr He,

17:02.019 --> 17:03.378
Mr Qin was arrested

17:03.379 --> 17:04.459
long time.

17:04.659 --> 17:05.099
Why are you going

17:05.100 --> 17:06.620
Did you just come see him now?

17:07.699 --> 17:09.259
He wrote a letter to the emperor

17:09.260 --> 17:11.458
to give to the emperor
for his mother.

17:11.459 --> 17:13.779
But since the Ministry of Etiquette
received the imperial decree,

17:13.820 --> 17:17.180
her mother was eventually named
as a worthy concubine.

17:17.820 --> 17:19.779
Now it's decided.

17:21.939 --> 17:23.539
Mister Qin relented.

17:23.540 --> 17:24.938
This subject

17:24.939 --> 17:26.539
this subject?

17:28.419 --> 17:30.380
It can resolve a dispute.

17:31.060 --> 17:34.140
But as soon as a heart gets hurt,

17:35.179 --> 17:37.060
cannot be cured easily.

17:42.060 --> 17:43.539
I have to go see him.

17:43.606 --> 17:45.762
(Lord Qin's Residence)

17:48.899 --> 17:49.739
Mr He,

17:49.740 --> 17:51.499
It's not easy for us to enter like this.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.138
But Mister Qin's mansion is huge.

17:53.139 --> 17:54.820
Where did he go?

17:55.979 --> 17:57.299
You have the whistle, right?

17:57.300 --> 17:58.779
Hurry up and ask Ear to guide us.

17:59.300 --> 18:00.180
You are sure,

18:15.300 --> 18:16.859
taozi, Tenente He.

18:16.860 --> 18:17.900
Why are you here?

18:17.979 --> 18:18.859
Take this girl

18:18.860 --> 18:19.898
to find Mr. Qin.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.140
Okay, let's go.

18:21.459 --> 18:22.060
Let's go.

18:28.340 --> 18:29.499
Bring me more drink.

18:30.379 --> 18:31.860
Bring me more drink!

18:33.540 --> 18:34.739
It can leave.

18:34.740 --> 18:35.779
You don't have to serve me.

18:35.780 --> 18:38.219
Don't you really want me to
serve you wine?

18:45.459 --> 18:47.860
It's sad to drink alone.

18:48.020 --> 18:49.219
I'll drink with you.

18:56.820 --> 18:58.060
Why are you here?

18:58.860 --> 19:00.978
I came to see if you are enjoying it

19:00.979 --> 19:02.978
enjoying the extravagant life of alcoholic beverage

19:02.979 --> 19:04.739
and beautiful ladies.

19:07.260 --> 19:09.259
It's not extravagant.

19:10.139 --> 19:11.380
But now I have

19:12.260 --> 19:13.939
a beautiful lady by my side.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.499
Shiqi.

19:23.300 --> 19:24.779
Are you well?

19:28.340 --> 19:29.340
No.

19:41.060 --> 19:42.340
My mom

19:42.540 --> 19:44.459
died during my birth.

19:46.820 --> 19:48.100
Since

19:48.300 --> 19:50.180
I came to this world,

19:50.899 --> 19:51.978
I never had a chance to

19:51.979 --> 19:53.140
to be filial to her.

19:54.419 --> 19:55.939
She comes from a humble background.

19:56.179 --> 19:58.259
She was like a weed

19:59.100 --> 20:00.860
It looked like a weed.

20:02.379 --> 20:04.140
Nobody cares about her,

20:04.379 --> 20:05.820
no one noticed.

20:06.659 --> 20:08.259
Even many years after his death,

20:09.979 --> 20:11.739
She doesn't even have a title.

20:13.780 --> 20:16.380
That day in court,

20:16.939 --> 20:19.418
even if it meant
a decent title, even if it meant

20:19.419 --> 20:21.059
I would lose my title of Lord Qin.

20:21.060 --> 20:22.100
Even if...

20:23.459 --> 20:25.580
Even if the title is just one.

20:31.860 --> 20:34.019
But they didn't give it to her

20:35.659 --> 20:37.499
an empty title.

20:39.060 --> 20:40.539
My father

20:41.780 --> 20:43.620
I didn't want to give him anything.

20:46.979 --> 20:47.898
In the past I knew

20:47.899 --> 20:49.539
My father didn't like me.

20:50.060 --> 20:52.779
And he blamed me for my mother's death.

20:54.500 --> 20:55.819
I thought that

20:55.820 --> 20:57.898
In fact, he was a little

20:57.899 --> 20:59.340
from my mother.

21:00.139 --> 21:02.019
But now I discovered that

21:03.979 --> 21:05.299
He does not care

21:05.300 --> 21:06.620
my mother's death.

21:08.179 --> 21:09.699
My mother's death.

21:11.619 --> 21:13.539
He despises her origins.

21:13.619 --> 21:15.299
She has no relationship with him.

21:15.699 --> 21:16.979
Say.

21:17.340 --> 21:19.779
My mother's death

21:20.619 --> 21:22.499
giving birth to me?

21:29.459 --> 21:31.539
She also suffered a lot

21:31.780 --> 21:33.580
for me too.

21:34.659 --> 21:36.099
According to others,

21:36.100 --> 21:38.060
she took so many medicines

21:38.340 --> 21:40.459
to accumulate waste
can be piled up.

21:41.860 --> 21:43.979
But when my mother was still alive

21:44.219 --> 21:45.820
always told me

21:46.179 --> 21:47.299
in this life,

21:47.300 --> 21:48.939
did in this life

21:49.979 --> 21:51.779
was giving birth to me.

21:54.129 --> 21:55.088
Shiqi,

21:56.179 --> 21:58.499
It's the saying about
for a month,

21:59.300 --> 22:00.339
It's an absurd.

22:00.340 --> 22:02.219
By stupid people.

22:02.939 --> 22:04.059
Your mother

22:04.060 --> 22:05.939
to save you.

22:06.699 --> 22:07.698
She doesn't want to see you

22:07.699 --> 22:09.820
Seeing you blaming yourself like that.

22:10.540 --> 22:11.739
She would like you to live

22:11.740 --> 22:14.100
you can live a free life.

22:18.820 --> 22:20.499
Freedom.

22:26.100 --> 22:28.580
It's freer.

22:30.899 --> 22:33.259
There is no such thing
as a free and easy life.

22:35.260 --> 22:36.340
At first I thought that

22:37.340 --> 22:39.259
after recovering Xichang,

22:39.659 --> 22:41.660
I could get out of this war.

22:43.619 --> 22:45.180
But now,

22:46.619 --> 22:48.380
everyone is plotting

22:50.139 --> 22:51.580
people are conspiring

22:53.459 --> 22:55.060
em Xichang.

22:57.780 --> 22:59.499
And even

23:00.820 --> 23:03.459
even in Lord Qin's Mansion.

23:04.780 --> 23:05.620
And me?

23:07.899 --> 23:10.100
I can't do anything so small.

23:16.060 --> 23:18.100
I can't even

23:19.699 --> 23:21.420
find a title

23:23.100 --> 23:24.380
for my mother.

23:28.979 --> 23:29.978
I don't know either

23:29.979 --> 23:31.380
what else can I do.

23:34.699 --> 23:35.939
I feel that

23:38.300 --> 23:39.580
so useless.

23:42.580 --> 23:44.259
I feel like crap.

23:56.300 --> 23:57.779
In fact, I'm very sad.

23:59.580 --> 24:02.140
I am very sad.

24:03.820 --> 24:04.620
I know.

24:05.020 --> 24:06.060
Shiqi.

24:18.300 --> 24:19.539
In truth,

24:21.580 --> 24:23.699
I'm very envious of General Cui.

24:26.219 --> 24:27.340
Because?

24:28.020 --> 24:30.340
Because he can always be with you.

24:36.260 --> 24:38.499
I'm here now, right?

24:41.379 --> 24:43.539
But you have to leave.

24:47.219 --> 24:48.420
Ok.

24:49.179 --> 24:50.660
I promise you

24:52.300 --> 24:53.820
I won't leave.

24:55.260 --> 24:56.699
I won't go tonight.

25:01.979 --> 25:03.019
Serious?

25:06.139 --> 25:06.900
Sim.

25:27.380 --> 25:28.341
Taozi.

25:31.180 --> 25:32.659
You haven't seen me in so long,

25:32.660 --> 25:34.219
because you

25:34.220 --> 25:36.020
To run away?

25:37.341 --> 25:38.460
Because I...

25:39.101 --> 25:40.700
Because I went to get this for you.

25:41.380 --> 25:42.581
What's that?

25:43.101 --> 25:44.659
(Astragalus spp.)
These are the medicinal herbs I have prepared for you.

25:44.660 --> 25:45.459
Look,

25:45.460 --> 25:46.821
This is astragalus,

25:46.980 --> 25:48.181
angelica,

25:48.821 --> 25:49.901
this is a Chinese peony.

25:50.061 --> 25:51.061
And these

25:51.101 --> 25:52.139
I bought some medicinal herbs

25:52.140 --> 25:53.580
I bought it at the pharmacy,

25:53.581 --> 25:54.379
and my dry parts

25:54.380 --> 25:55.580
to the mountains,

25:55.581 --> 25:56.740
in the mountains.

25:58.140 --> 25:59.581
In truth,

26:00.420 --> 26:02.020
whenever I think of you,

26:02.101 --> 26:03.861
I will collect herbs.

26:06.900 --> 26:09.500
Whenever you miss me?

26:10.220 --> 26:11.780
Look.

26:12.220 --> 26:14.341
You thought of me.

26:14.380 --> 26:17.740
One, two, four, six...

26:18.341 --> 26:21.381
You've thought of me
more than 30 times.

26:26.021 --> 26:27.141
Then,

26:27.501 --> 26:29.700
if you miss me next time,

26:29.900 --> 26:31.500
You can come see me.

26:31.741 --> 26:33.300
You can also write to me

26:33.420 --> 26:35.260
like Lord Qin

26:35.301 --> 26:36.740
and Lieutenant He like it.

26:37.261 --> 26:38.300
Serious?

26:38.940 --> 26:40.300
Clear.

26:42.741 --> 26:44.101
So, Tao Zi,

26:44.821 --> 26:47.061
you missed me

26:47.180 --> 26:48.700
all this time?

26:52.700 --> 26:54.540
Guess.

26:56.501 --> 26:59.580
Have you guessed yet?

26:59.581 --> 27:01.460
How can you be so sure?

27:02.061 --> 27:03.300
Because if you hadn't missed me,

27:03.301 --> 27:04.899
wouldn't have asked me to

27:04.900 --> 27:06.740
to see you see,

27:06.741 --> 27:08.979
you wouldn't have asked me
to write letters

27:08.980 --> 27:10.460
senhor shiqi.

27:15.261 --> 27:16.139
Right?

27:16.140 --> 27:17.381
I knew.

27:18.420 --> 27:19.700
You can say yes.

31:06.140 --> 31:07.421
Finally woke up.

31:07.980 --> 31:09.460
What time is it?

31:10.021 --> 31:11.700
It's already noon.

31:14.220 --> 31:15.141
I remember...

31:18.180 --> 31:20.500
I remember last night
in the pavilion last night,

31:21.660 --> 31:23.300
I got drunk.

31:26.301 --> 31:27.861
I had a beautiful dream.

31:28.420 --> 31:29.940
What dream?

31:32.220 --> 31:33.181
A dream

31:35.460 --> 31:37.300
a very happy dream.

31:38.620 --> 31:40.101
It looks so real.

31:42.581 --> 31:44.780
Did you dream about Lieutenant He?

31:46.861 --> 31:48.740
But she couldn't have come.

31:49.180 --> 31:50.580
Looks like you got it

31:50.581 --> 31:52.700
a serious case

31:52.900 --> 31:54.341
of love sickness.

31:54.380 --> 31:55.540
Last night

31:55.581 --> 31:57.780
drinking alone.

31:57.781 --> 31:58.740
I wanted to drink with you,

31:58.741 --> 32:00.381
but you kicked me out.

32:03.940 --> 32:04.700
Sim.

32:14.460 --> 32:16.181
Mr. He, comma.

32:16.541 --> 32:17.419
You can eat.

32:17.420 --> 32:18.621
I can not eat.

32:20.101 --> 32:21.421
It's understandable.

32:21.821 --> 32:23.500
You stayed up all night.

32:24.660 --> 32:25.780
Let's find a hotel

32:25.781 --> 32:26.699
a hotel in the village ahead,

32:26.700 --> 32:27.699
let's rest for half a day

32:27.700 --> 32:29.421
for us to continue?

32:29.861 --> 32:30.780
There is no necessity.

32:30.821 --> 32:31.820
i sleep

32:31.821 --> 32:33.020
I slept a little.

32:35.861 --> 32:37.061
Did you travel

32:37.420 --> 32:38.820
a long trip.

32:38.821 --> 32:39.939
Traveling day and night,

32:39.940 --> 32:41.300
to see Lord Qin,

32:41.341 --> 32:42.980
Why didn't you stay a little longer?

32:43.341 --> 32:44.419
Do you think that

32:44.420 --> 32:45.260
just a little

32:45.261 --> 32:46.101
to chat a little?

32:49.101 --> 32:50.740
Just see it,

32:51.021 --> 32:52.141
I will be at ease.

32:53.021 --> 32:54.581
If discovered by someone else,

32:54.861 --> 32:56.621
there will be many complications.

32:58.220 --> 32:59.700
I just do not know

33:00.420 --> 33:01.861
how long will it take

33:02.420 --> 33:03.700
your sadness and guilt

33:05.140 --> 33:07.101
your sadness and guilt?

33:08.301 --> 33:10.141
Anyway, I still think

33:10.180 --> 33:11.780
two lovers must always be

33:11.781 --> 33:13.861
forever.

33:14.460 --> 33:16.181
It is not enough

33:16.261 --> 33:17.500
it is not enough.

33:18.980 --> 33:20.459
I think someone

33:20.460 --> 33:22.260
want to keep her ear

33:22.261 --> 33:24.581
For a long time.

33:25.620 --> 33:26.661
Mr He,

33:28.541 --> 33:30.061
like this?

33:30.220 --> 33:31.940
I just stayed away from him for a while

33:32.180 --> 33:33.661
and I miss him already.

33:35.700 --> 33:36.421
And you,

33:36.741 --> 33:38.460
Do you miss Lord Qin?

33:42.261 --> 33:43.300
Sim,

33:44.220 --> 33:45.621
not see each other for a day,

33:47.021 --> 33:48.500
it's been months.

34:19.380 --> 34:20.541

34:21.380 --> 34:22.660
Taozi was here yesterday.

34:22.661 --> 34:24.939
She said she wanted dried fruit,
so I bought it this morning.

34:24.939 --> 34:26.810
I was looking for someone
to give it to her.

34:27.701 --> 34:29.300
Taozi came yesterday?

34:29.301 --> 34:29.899
Sim,

34:29.900 --> 34:31.420
she came with Lieutenant He.

34:32.301 --> 34:32.740
I don't know

34:32.741 --> 34:33.981

He said it would be bad

Mr He,

35:51.460 --> 35:52.539
we must reach Luoyang

35:52.540 --> 35:53.941
before dark.

35:58.020 --> 35:59.939
This place is very interesting.

35:59.940 --> 36:01.420
Do you give the flowers with tea?

36:02.301 --> 36:03.380
Enjoy.

36:06.540 --> 36:07.780
Lieutenant He, experiment.

36:10.380 --> 36:11.420
It smells so good.

36:15.020 --> 36:16.541
Why did you add another cup of tea?

36:18.141 --> 36:19.340
Haven't you left yet?

36:24.221 --> 36:25.541
I will disappear.

36:29.661 --> 36:30.740
Why are you here?

36:31.261 --> 36:32.740
I came to see you.

36:34.020 --> 36:36.420
Didn't you see enough last night?

36:38.701 --> 36:39.660
I was very drunk

36:39.661 --> 36:41.380
I couldn't see it clearly.

36:41.821 --> 36:42.740
Your journey was long.

36:42.940 --> 36:44.181

36:44.341 --> 36:45.621
I appreciate that.

36:46.821 --> 36:48.059
I'm happy to do that.

36:48.060 --> 36:49.220
I don't think it's a difficult task.

36:49.580 --> 36:50.661
Soon too

36:50.821 --> 36:52.141
look for you.

36:53.500 --> 36:55.061
You are not afraid that

36:55.100 --> 36:56.340
not afraid of being misunderstood

36:56.460 --> 36:58.459
I thought you would come with soldiers

36:58.460 --> 36:59.740
to claim Luoyang.

37:00.460 --> 37:02.019
My father always wanted

37:02.020 --> 37:03.099
fight with Lord Qin

37:03.100 --> 37:04.820
on the battlefield.

37:04.861 --> 37:05.620
Are you giving

37:05.621 --> 37:06.780
the oportunity?

37:07.940 --> 37:09.499
If he puts you as the vanguard,

37:09.500 --> 37:10.820
Maybe I'll lose.

37:10.980 --> 37:12.820

37:13.380 --> 37:14.820

37:14.821 --> 37:16.021
You must be merciful to me.

37:17.221 --> 37:18.700
Don't worry.

37:18.741 --> 37:20.059
If you are really in danger,

37:20.060 --> 37:21.740
I will come to help you.

37:22.380 --> 37:23.021
He is well.

37:23.940 --> 37:26.260
I appreciate your promise.

37:26.460 --> 37:27.939
But Lord Qin is really

37:27.940 --> 37:29.541
It's really very brave.

37:29.621 --> 37:30.379
Please don't give me

37:30.380 --> 37:31.380
This opportunity.

37:31.940 --> 37:33.260
I accept your auspicious words.

37:33.980 --> 37:34.499
Then,

37:34.500 --> 37:36.059
you always owe me a favor,

37:36.060 --> 37:37.581
and you won't be able to reciprocate.

37:45.301 --> 37:48.300
Li Ni is retreating
to advance.

37:48.460 --> 37:50.860
He sent his father
a letter to his father

37:50.861 --> 37:52.379
wishing
your biological mother

37:52.380 --> 37:53.621
like a godess.

37:53.661 --> 37:54.939
But my father was kind enough to

37:54.940 --> 37:57.181
he gave it to his mother
for his mother.

37:57.741 --> 38:00.140
Li Ni is not reflecting in seclusion.

38:00.141 --> 38:01.539
He is constantly planning

38:01.540 --> 38:04.501
regain control of the Zhenxi army.

38:04.781 --> 38:05.621
Jun,

38:05.781 --> 38:07.300
my father asked you to stay

38:07.500 --> 38:09.099
to oversee his mother's wedding.

38:09.100 --> 38:10.499
So he can only name her

38:10.500 --> 38:12.419
for you.

38:12.420 --> 38:13.459
He left General Pei Yuan

38:13.460 --> 38:15.220
take the troops to Changzhou.

38:15.261 --> 38:16.939
We have to be careful

38:16.940 --> 38:19.101
Li Ni's influence in Changzhou,

38:19.141 --> 38:20.420
or even

38:20.701 --> 38:22.740
take over the Zhenxi army.

38:24.500 --> 38:25.860
Don't worry,

38:26.621 --> 38:28.539
as the Commander-in-Chief,

38:28.540 --> 38:30.340
I won't let them have that chance.

38:30.741 --> 38:33.621
This time for Changzhou,
the situation was critical.

38:33.701 --> 38:35.059
I ordered Pei Yuan

38:35.060 --> 38:36.579
to lead 30% of the forces

38:36.580 --> 38:37.820
and food at the front.

38:37.821 --> 38:39.019
He must think that

38:39.020 --> 38:41.340
that there will be
Reinforcements arriving.

38:42.861 --> 38:44.340
That's what he wants.

38:45.060 --> 38:46.660
Pei Yuan only follows Li Ni's orders,

38:46.661 --> 38:48.300
it's not like this?

38:48.741 --> 38:50.661
If we lose for too long,

38:51.380 --> 38:52.941
verei se Li Ni

38:53.580 --> 38:56.461
protect him.

38:58.781 --> 38:59.780
Governor,

39:00.020 --> 39:01.400
You
recently recovered from poisoning.

39:01.400 --> 39:02.941
(Tong Pass)
Go rest.

39:04.940 --> 39:06.499
Li Ni

39:06.500 --> 39:08.101
It's very cunning.

39:08.500 --> 39:09.939
I suspect he is trying to intercept

39:09.940 --> 39:13.340
which I sent to Baiyue
I sent to Baiyue, who I am looking for.

39:14.861 --> 39:16.380
Biandu News.

39:16.741 --> 39:17.700
Li Ni was dismissed

39:17.701 --> 39:19.260
his rank of commander.

39:19.341 --> 39:20.700
And he asked to reflect in isolation.

39:20.861 --> 39:22.419
The court may send
Lord Xin and Lord Qi

39:22.420 --> 39:23.780
as commanders

39:23.861 --> 39:25.021
to the south.

39:27.341 --> 39:30.260
The incompetence of a General
for the three armies.

39:30.861 --> 39:31.899
Like Lord Liang,

39:31.900 --> 39:34.181
you take Li Ni,

39:35.100 --> 39:36.941
arrested Li Ni,

39:37.621 --> 39:39.181
he cut off his own arm.

39:39.500 --> 39:40.420
Mayor.

39:43.060 --> 39:45.220
Governor, what did you send?
To look for the emperor's grandson,

39:45.221 --> 39:46.140
said that

39:46.141 --> 39:48.099
It looks like he's hiding

39:48.100 --> 39:49.780
in a village near Xichang.

39:55.940 --> 39:58.541
Order to capture
the royal great-grandson alive.

39:59.261 --> 40:01.340
The others will be executed
without mercy.

40:01.341 --> 40:01.981
Sim.

40:07.341 --> 40:09.340
It's a really good opportunity.

40:09.341 --> 40:10.939
Destiny is here.

40:10.940 --> 40:12.541
I will have good luck.

40:24.141 --> 40:25.461
PEI Yuan

40:26.500 --> 40:28.700
sent an urgent message

40:29.380 --> 40:32.220
saying that Baiyue
has already crossed

40:32.580 --> 40:34.621
rio Han

40:34.741 --> 40:36.380
and goes straight to Changzhou.

40:36.580 --> 40:39.620
Therefore, he asked the court for
the situation in Changzhou.

40:39.621 --> 40:42.981
To send reinforcements,
ask for reinforcements.

40:44.301 --> 40:45.101
Pai,

40:45.341 --> 40:46.740
In my humble opinion,

40:47.141 --> 40:49.260
the expedition to Baiyue

40:49.261 --> 40:51.379
para Baiyue.

40:51.380 --> 40:52.979
Furthermore, with the long march

40:52.980 --> 40:54.660
there is no food on the way.

40:54.661 --> 40:56.380
They are only a few
tens of thousands of people.

40:56.500 --> 40:59.419
PEI Yuan, from a military family

40:59.420 --> 41:00.780
and leading the army for many years,

41:01.100 --> 41:02.140
must be able to

41:02.141 --> 41:03.420
be able to solve.

41:03.741 --> 41:04.620
A General Pei Yuan

41:04.621 --> 41:06.019
asked the court for help.

41:06.020 --> 41:07.899
If the court does not do this,

41:07.900 --> 41:09.899
the Pei family will be sad.

41:09.900 --> 41:10.900
to,

41:11.020 --> 41:13.061
you are showing compassion as a woman.

41:13.500 --> 41:14.979
The Pei family, even if it is powerful,

41:14.980 --> 41:17.501
They are still their father's subjects.

41:17.580 --> 41:18.860
If we appease them

41:18.861 --> 41:20.419
and we meet your requirements,

41:20.420 --> 41:23.181
What is my father's position?

41:23.580 --> 41:24.780
But the Imperial Court

41:24.781 --> 41:26.541
it only allocated
30% of military supplies to them.

41:26.580 --> 41:27.941
In fact, it's not much.

41:31.420 --> 41:32.101
Pai,

41:32.460 --> 41:35.101
in the past,
when Li Ni led the Zhenxi army,

41:35.141 --> 41:37.061
the court had no food.

41:37.181 --> 41:39.900
But even so, the Zhenxi army followed

41:40.020 --> 41:41.459
marched from Laolan Pass

41:41.460 --> 41:43.380
to recover these two cities.

41:43.580 --> 41:44.780
Now that

41:44.781 --> 41:46.380
the Zhenxi army returned

41:46.500 --> 41:48.780
30% of supplies.

41:49.261 --> 41:50.820
Call for reinforcements

41:50.821 --> 41:51.780
It's just a try

41:51.781 --> 41:53.099
to obtain benefit
without contributing.

41:53.100 --> 41:54.300
These are unspoken practices

41:54.301 --> 41:55.860
during the army.

41:56.020 --> 41:58.780
Don't be fooled, father.

41:59.141 --> 42:01.099
You are the leader of the clan.

42:01.100 --> 42:02.820
How do you think

42:03.580 --> 42:05.700
How do you think we should respond?

42:06.821 --> 42:08.220
In my humble opinion,

42:08.460 --> 42:09.981
the court has to give an order.

42:10.100 --> 42:11.941
Ordering Pei Yuan not to delay

42:12.141 --> 42:13.860
not to delay and attack
from Changzhou

42:13.861 --> 42:15.021
to end

42:15.181 --> 42:17.220
the solar rebels leading
the expedition against Baiyue.

42:21.380 --> 42:23.320
They have no idea
and don't know what they are doing.

42:23.320 --> 42:25.960
Where are the reinforcements that
General Pei Yuan and the Zhenxi army promised?

42:25.960 --> 42:27.059
When it's time to march,

42:27.060 --> 42:28.300
he only had 30%

42:28.301 --> 42:29.899
30% strength and food.

42:29.900 --> 42:31.820
Now if there is no food

42:31.821 --> 42:33.059
no reinforcements,

42:33.060 --> 42:33.939
they asked us to

42:33.940 --> 42:35.740
to leave Changzhou
to face the enemies.

42:35.741 --> 42:37.740
This is not just sending
our Zhenxi soldiers

42:37.741 --> 42:39.061
for their deaths?

42:40.380 --> 42:41.501
Hand this over to the Taozi.

42:42.020 --> 42:43.220
We are already in this state

42:43.221 --> 42:45.501
Are you still writing to Lieutenant He?

42:45.861 --> 42:47.539
The court does not want to send reinforcements

42:47.540 --> 42:48.581
to support Changzhou.

42:49.060 --> 42:50.600
Instead, they want Pei Yuan
to attack.

42:50.741 --> 42:52.061
I can't leave the capital now.

42:52.221 --> 42:54.300
The only solution now is
to ask the Cui army for help

42:54.301 --> 42:55.581
to help Changzhou.

42:55.980 --> 42:57.541
I'm leaving now.

43:00.060 --> 43:00.899
Sr. shiqi,

43:00.900 --> 43:01.740
Do you want the Cui Army

43:01.741 --> 43:03.260
in Changzhou.

43:03.301 --> 43:04.941
That will work?

43:04.980 --> 43:06.539
I just said in the letter that

43:06.540 --> 43:08.300
I'm stuck in Changzhou.

43:08.341 --> 43:10.021
She can't just abandon me, can she?

43:18.221 --> 43:19.340
What are you looking at?

43:20.020 --> 43:21.019
I'm looking

43:21.020 --> 43:23.499
the most handsome guy

43:23.500 --> 43:25.260
the most beautiful boy in the world.

43:26.261 --> 43:28.240
When the situation demands it,
you must be humble.

43:28.240 --> 43:30.260
A real man can adapt.

43:31.701 --> 43:33.099
I know this letter

43:33.100 --> 43:34.581
can save Changzhou,

43:35.261 --> 43:37.260
then you must be a man

43:37.261 --> 43:39.581
which has never been dominated by anyone.
I was never able to.

43:39.900 --> 43:42.300
I dare not accept that compliment.

43:53.380 --> 43:55.661
Just looking at this,

43:56.781 --> 43:58.780
I don't think His Highness Lord Qin
did the right thing.

43:59.980 --> 44:01.061
Why not?

44:01.261 --> 44:02.780
He must know that

44:02.781 --> 44:04.059
If you have time,

44:04.060 --> 44:06.820
when you have time.

44:06.821 --> 44:08.019
However, he chooses to do

44:08.020 --> 44:08.981
through straw.

44:09.181 --> 44:10.180
What if everything you do

44:10.181 --> 44:11.581
What are you going to do
in just two days?

44:11.701 --> 44:13.019
He should have done

44:13.020 --> 44:14.780
wooden.

44:14.781 --> 44:16.141
It's more resistant that way.

44:17.621 --> 44:19.579
Xie Chang 'er pensou no futuro.

44:19.580 --> 44:20.979
He wouldn't have had the idea

44:20.980 --> 44:22.520
the idea of ​​doing it for you
For you.

44:22.520 --> 44:24.061
After all, it never breaks.

44:24.181 --> 44:25.019
Seeing things this way,

44:25.020 --> 44:26.181
Mr. Qin really

44:26.580 --> 44:27.860
wasn't that attentive.

44:27.940 --> 44:29.300
Lieutenant He!

44:29.940 --> 44:30.820
Lieutenant He!

44:33.741 --> 44:34.620
If you talk about the devil,

44:34.621 --> 44:35.700
he must appear.

44:36.221 --> 44:37.560
An urgent letter from Mr. shiqi.

44:44.613 --> 44:46.035
If Changzhou is in danger,
no reinforcements.

44:46.036 --> 44:47.777
I can only ask you to stop
this situation.

44:50.420 --> 44:51.181
Your Majesty!

44:51.741 --> 44:52.419
Monarch.

44:52.420 --> 44:53.459
Urgent report from Changzhou!

44:53.460 --> 44:54.581
What is the situation?

44:54.661 --> 44:56.140
General Pei Yuan attacked.

44:56.140 --> 44:57.260
But they fought for two days.

44:57.261 --> 44:59.499
They were outnumbered
and surrounded by solar rebels.

44:59.500 --> 45:01.180
The Zhenxi army was almost wiped out.

45:01.181 --> 45:03.019
And General Pei Yuan
was seriously injured.

45:03.020 --> 45:04.501
What about the city of Changzhou?

45:04.821 --> 45:06.340
O General Pingliang Cui Yi

45:06.341 --> 45:07.539
arrived with the Cui Army

45:07.540 --> 45:09.220
to successfully eliminate it successfully
.

45:09.221 --> 45:10.800
General Pei Yuan seized the opportunity

45:10.800 --> 45:12.410
to lead the Zhenxi army
to cross the river

45:12.410 --> 45:14.160
we set up a military camp
in Changzhou.

45:14.621 --> 45:16.059
But...

45:16.060 --> 45:17.780
Cui Yi and Cui's army

45:17.781 --> 45:19.140
entered the city of Changzhou.

45:19.141 --> 45:19.899
What?

45:19.900 --> 45:21.661
Has Cuyi already taken the city of Changzhou?

45:21.741 --> 45:22.700
Pai,

45:22.701 --> 45:24.459
Changzhou city is
It is very important.

45:24.460 --> 45:25.740
Be in the hands of Sun Jing

45:25.741 --> 45:26.820
ou de Cui Yi,

45:26.821 --> 45:29.021
it will be very disadvantageous for us.

45:29.100 --> 45:30.061
Pai,

45:30.100 --> 45:31.579
Pei Yuan lost the city of Changzhou

45:31.580 --> 45:33.101
his crime
for his crime.

45:33.540 --> 45:34.340
Brother,

45:34.460 --> 45:36.860
Now is not the time
to discuss crime and punishment.

45:36.940 --> 45:39.220
Changzhou was lost
under Pei Yuan's command.

45:39.221 --> 45:40.780
Why can't we hold him accountable?

45:41.020 --> 45:43.300
The father rejected it.
The request for reinforcements

45:43.301 --> 45:44.780
call for reinforcements.

45:44.781 --> 45:46.499
The great general Peixian personally
came to the palace.

45:46.500 --> 45:48.099
And asked his father
to send reinforcements

45:48.100 --> 45:50.021
for the Zhenxi army.

45:50.100 --> 45:51.900
But, Jun, you said

45:52.181 --> 45:54.019
General Pei Yuan is afraid to fight

45:54.020 --> 45:55.220
and wanted to avoid it.

45:55.221 --> 45:57.740
Afterwards, three imperial decrees
for Changzhou,

45:57.741 --> 45:58.939
forcing him to fight.

45:58.940 --> 46:02.099
Now Changzhou is lost.

46:02.100 --> 46:03.019
We blame General Pei Yuan

46:03.020 --> 46:04.419
to General Pei Yuan,

46:04.420 --> 46:05.461
afraid

46:05.580 --> 46:07.220
the Pei family will not tolerate it.

46:10.540 --> 46:12.180
Do something!

46:12.181 --> 46:13.459
Cuyi!

46:13.460 --> 46:14.579
Last time he caught Dongdu,

46:14.580 --> 46:15.939
has now taken Changzhou.

46:15.940 --> 46:17.220
If it continues like this,

46:17.301 --> 46:19.300
What's the point of me being the Emperor?

46:19.301 --> 46:21.021
How can I face this world?

46:21.341 --> 46:22.220
Pai,

46:22.221 --> 46:24.180
there is someone I would like to recommend.

46:24.181 --> 46:24.899
If this person

46:24.900 --> 46:26.099
lead the army,

46:26.100 --> 46:27.501
they will definitely be able to capture Changzhou.

46:28.261 --> 46:29.059
Who?

46:29.060 --> 46:30.860
Li Ni.

46:30.940 --> 46:31.900
No way.

46:31.940 --> 46:34.180
Li Ni received an order to
keep an eye out.

46:34.181 --> 46:35.300
How can he lead soldiers?

46:35.301 --> 46:37.019
Since I was a child,
since I was a child.

46:37.020 --> 46:38.539
Since I was a child.

46:38.540 --> 46:40.899
And the Cui Army
never lost a battle.

46:40.900 --> 46:42.499
Furthermore, he is the only one

46:42.500 --> 46:43.660
who always had a close relationship

46:43.661 --> 46:44.700
with the Pei family.

46:44.701 --> 46:45.939
If we let Ni

46:45.940 --> 46:47.220
para Changzhou,

46:47.221 --> 46:49.499
maybe he can dispel
the chaos in the Pei family

46:49.500 --> 46:50.661
to revive the army.

46:53.781 --> 46:55.499
Li Ni is arrogant and reckless.

46:55.500 --> 46:57.461
Does yours

46:57.781 --> 46:59.220
shouldn't it be considered?

46:59.661 --> 47:01.539
In that case,

47:01.540 --> 47:02.941
in this situation?

47:03.020 --> 47:04.059
Will you yourself

47:04.060 --> 47:06.260
To the expedition?

47:06.341 --> 47:08.379
You are your father's eldest son.

47:08.380 --> 47:10.019
Even if my father agrees,

47:10.020 --> 47:11.140
the court and the ministers

47:11.141 --> 47:12.220
will not allow

47:12.221 --> 47:14.220
of being exported to such perigo.

47:15.781 --> 47:17.099
Ok.

47:17.100 --> 47:19.340
Lai is right.

47:19.621 --> 47:20.981
Issue a decree.

47:21.500 --> 47:24.420
Mister Qin reflected on his actions.

47:24.500 --> 47:26.181
Your punishment will be lifted.

47:26.261 --> 47:30.541
He will lead the troops
to help Changzhou.
