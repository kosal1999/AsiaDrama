01:49.310 --> 01:50.560
How about Miss Peach?

01:50.680 --> 01:51.760
Did I buy the right thing?

01:54.280 --> 01:55.680
The captain asked me to give it to His Majesty the Emperor

01:55.680 --> 01:56.280
The fake death medicine

01:56.280 --> 01:57.430
But it's very complicated

01:57.430 --> 01:58.070
If you can't find it

01:58.070 --> 01:59.310
All the medicinal materials

01:59.310 --> 02:01.000
This medicine just won’t work.

02:02.000 --> 02:02.640
inside

02:02.710 --> 02:04.280
I still need a lot of medicine.

02:05.710 --> 02:07.680
But the medicinal shop in the market

02:07.870 --> 02:08.910
I've been all over

02:09.400 --> 02:10.750
Those medicinal herbs you want?

02:11.030 --> 02:12.400
I really can’t buy it anymore

02:14.240 --> 02:15.590
Otherwise

02:15.800 --> 02:17.750
Let me accompany you to the mountains to collect medicinal materials.

02:19.120 --> 02:20.520
I was there some time ago

02:20.630 --> 02:22.360
Prepared a poison

02:22.430 --> 02:23.750
As long as someone gets it on you

02:23.870 --> 02:25.150
It will be extremely itchy

02:25.560 --> 02:26.150
I'd rather take the antidote

02:26.280 --> 02:27.310
Developed

02:27.630 --> 02:28.310
Just suffer from

02:28.430 --> 02:30.240
No one has tried it for me yet

02:30.430 --> 02:31.560
I don’t know if it’s useful or not.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.030
Then let me try

02:33.630 --> 02:35.080
This will be very itchy

02:35.280 --> 02:36.630
I'm not kidding you

02:36.910 --> 02:38.520
What if my antidote doesn't work?

02:38.630 --> 02:39.400
You'll at least get itchy

02:39.520 --> 02:40.680
Three days and three nights

02:41.470 --> 02:42.520
It's okay, peach girl

02:42.630 --> 02:43.310
I trust you

02:44.280 --> 02:44.680
OK

02:45.030 --> 02:45.750
That's it

02:45.910 --> 02:47.590
Since you helped me try the antidote

02:47.750 --> 02:48.910
The medicinal materials Shiqirou asked for

02:49.030 --> 02:50.240
I will definitely prepare it for you as soon as possible

02:50.910 --> 02:51.280
good

02:56.280 --> 02:57.400
I know you love sweets

02:57.560 --> 02:59.680
Come and try this Tang Cai Su

03:01.190 --> 03:02.800
Which store did you buy this from?

03:02.910 --> 03:03.840
This is not bought

03:03.960 --> 03:05.190
Miss Gu just sent it over

03:07.000 --> 03:09.190
She made it specially for you

03:09.470 --> 03:10.840
Of course not

03:11.030 --> 03:12.560
A Yuan Lao Bao and the others all have it

03:12.840 --> 03:13.710
I remember you like to eat

03:13.840 --> 03:15.190
I brought it here specially for you

03:15.430 --> 03:16.120
take a taste

03:17.190 --> 03:17.840
Put it here

03:18.000 --> 03:18.800
I'll eat it later

03:19.190 --> 03:19.710
Fine

03:21.590 --> 03:22.120
correct

03:22.630 --> 03:24.280
I've already contacted everyone in Kyoto.

03:24.430 --> 03:25.400
Everything is ready now

03:25.560 --> 03:26.360
I only owe east wind

03:27.870 --> 03:28.960
The medicine is at Taozi's place

03:29.120 --> 03:29.870
Not ready yet

03:30.000 --> 03:30.560
I know

03:31.000 --> 03:32.360
I let Chang Er follow her every day

03:32.470 --> 03:33.520
See what I can do to help

03:33.680 --> 03:35.680
Ask Xie Changer to help Taozi

03:35.960 --> 03:37.430
I think it would be better not to cause more trouble

03:37.560 --> 03:38.680
It's okay to cause chaos

03:38.840 --> 03:40.360
Save her from always being next to you

03:40.630 --> 03:42.280
I'm afraid she'll prick me with a poisonous needle

03:42.910 --> 03:43.710
good

03:43.840 --> 03:45.280
Why did she stab you with a poisonous needle?

03:49.560 --> 03:50.800
Because

03:57.680 --> 03:58.680
Let's break camp

04:00.030 --> 04:01.630
Live here with Zhenxijun

04:01.750 --> 04:02.800
Enough inconvenience

04:03.190 --> 04:05.030
Even if we set up camp outside today

04:05.870 --> 04:06.870
Have to move out too

04:09.000 --> 04:09.400
yes

04:16.950 --> 04:18.070
I suddenly remembered

04:18.240 --> 04:19.120
Our son

04:19.240 --> 04:20.160
I love this snack the most

04:20.430 --> 04:21.600
I will send it to the young master now

04:22.360 --> 04:23.480
I brought you snacks specially

04:23.600 --> 04:24.750
How do you give it to someone else?

04:26.120 --> 04:27.720
Isn't that someone else gave it to you?

04:27.800 --> 04:29.040
You just brought it to me

04:51.510 --> 04:52.190
Grand Governor

04:53.310 --> 04:54.720
Chinzei Army Hwa Choi Family Army

04:54.830 --> 04:56.390
Join hands to conquer the capital

04:57.430 --> 04:59.600
Fu Yuan'er died in the city

05:00.040 --> 05:00.430
this

05:01.070 --> 05:02.360
Cui Jiajun didn't immediately

05:02.480 --> 05:03.360
Return to Yingzhou

05:03.480 --> 05:04.560
Also joined forces with the Zhenxi Army

05:04.680 --> 05:05.720
Attack Luoyang

05:07.310 --> 05:09.160
Cui Yi's son Cui Lin

05:09.600 --> 05:11.390
Look at his past behavior

05:11.720 --> 05:13.920
You know he is very calm

05:15.190 --> 05:17.390
If the war situation at that time were me

05:17.480 --> 05:19.190
I will definitely attack Luoyang first

05:19.560 --> 05:20.870
Save Yingzhou again

05:22.190 --> 05:23.240
But Luoyang City is strong

05:23.390 --> 05:24.240
Sufficient food and grass

05:24.600 --> 05:26.480
Fu Yuan'er just needs to hold on and not come out

05:27.040 --> 05:28.070
Chinzei Army Hwa Choi Family Army

05:28.190 --> 05:29.630
That’s ten times more powerful

05:30.000 --> 05:30.830
It's absolutely impossible

05:30.950 --> 05:32.360
Destroy the city in a short time

05:32.600 --> 05:33.310
and

05:33.390 --> 05:34.950
Fu Yuan'er is a veteran on the battlefield.

05:35.070 --> 05:35.560
How could it be

05:35.600 --> 05:37.310
Defeated at the hands of two children

05:38.240 --> 05:39.510
Lost this battle

05:40.240 --> 05:42.120
It's my fault in hiring people

05:45.630 --> 05:47.120
This loss of Luoyang

05:47.950 --> 05:49.680
It gave me a wake-up call

05:51.120 --> 05:53.160
Strong enemies are nothing but external forces

05:53.750 --> 05:55.750
What can really destroy oneself

05:56.120 --> 05:57.560
Often it’s the inside

05:58.360 --> 06:01.600
This West Changjing seems to be impregnable

06:02.480 --> 06:04.160
I'm afraid there are also loopholes

06:06.160 --> 06:08.040
I'll send someone to check it out.

06:08.120 --> 06:09.270
Kyoto aristocratic families

06:09.510 --> 06:11.950
Be careful to prevent him from secretly colluding with the rebels

06:12.310 --> 06:14.190
The person who secretly colludes

06:15.270 --> 06:17.480
Not just in aristocratic families

06:19.360 --> 06:22.190
Seventeenth Lang Cui's army broke out of camp

06:22.750 --> 06:24.390
What break camp

06:24.560 --> 06:25.070
right

06:33.800 --> 06:34.510
school lieutenant

06:35.000 --> 06:36.360
It's almost all sorted out

06:36.870 --> 06:38.070
I'll go for a walk by the river

06:38.240 --> 06:39.270
I'll go with you

06:39.390 --> 06:39.870
No

06:40.000 --> 06:40.680
You should be busy first

06:40.920 --> 06:41.390
good

06:43.310 --> 06:44.510
Collect everything inside quickly

06:44.680 --> 06:45.560
Yes Yes

06:53.160 --> 06:54.390
No matter what you say, don't say a word

06:54.510 --> 06:56.310
I suddenly have to break camp and move out of the city.

06:58.680 --> 07:00.510
How does our Cui Jiajun behave?

07:01.360 --> 07:02.920
I have to report it to the emperor’s grandson.

07:05.310 --> 07:06.270
That's not true

07:07.510 --> 07:08.680
Just walking in a hurry

07:09.720 --> 07:11.190
I remember not being able to give you a ride

07:12.070 --> 07:13.040
Think of it again

07:13.430 --> 07:15.070
You will be returning to Yingzhou soon

07:15.830 --> 07:17.310
From now on, the mountains are high and the rivers are far away

07:17.870 --> 07:19.390
I don’t know when we can meet again

07:25.190 --> 07:26.240
Then I promise you

07:28.120 --> 07:29.750
Before I go back to Yingzhou

07:34.680 --> 07:36.510
I must come and say goodbye to you properly

07:39.270 --> 07:40.000
you said

07:45.600 --> 07:46.870
How did this happen?

07:50.240 --> 07:52.560
There are so many wolves in Laolan Guan

07:52.950 --> 07:54.680
Every time I go out of town and meet a wolf

07:54.870 --> 07:55.600
We will do it casually

07:55.750 --> 07:57.160
Pick up a stone to kill the wolf

07:57.390 --> 07:58.240
It’s been a long time

07:58.630 --> 08:00.360
Everyone has learned this skill

08:01.160 --> 08:02.510
Whenever I have free time

08:02.920 --> 08:03.830
will be by the Laolanguan River

08:04.000 --> 08:04.870
in vain

08:05.390 --> 08:06.270
Where's the winner?

08:06.390 --> 08:08.510
The first piece of roasted lamb belongs to him

08:10.310 --> 08:11.600
sounds really interesting

08:12.240 --> 08:13.070
Want to try it?

08:14.680 --> 08:15.070
Come

08:26.600 --> 08:27.240
not far enough

08:27.800 --> 08:28.430
I teach you

08:30.040 --> 08:31.120
I teach you

08:32.000 --> 08:32.360
hold

09:10.720 --> 09:12.030
It's done

09:12.270 --> 09:13.440
So that's it

09:42.910 --> 09:43.670
Jushichiro

09:48.960 --> 09:50.030
Cui Li came to see me

09:50.550 --> 09:51.200
Cui Li

09:54.480 --> 09:56.440
This person has great ambition but little talent

09:56.550 --> 09:57.960
And the villain has no moral integrity

09:58.480 --> 10:00.120
Do anything for power

10:01.550 --> 10:02.120
how

10:02.480 --> 10:03.630
What does he want from you?

10:04.200 --> 10:06.390
He wants to join forces with us to kill Cui Lin

10:07.670 --> 10:08.600
General Pei

10:08.960 --> 10:11.790
I intend to join forces with the Zhenxi Army

10:12.390 --> 10:14.080
Kill Cui Lin

10:15.960 --> 10:16.440
You are not afraid

10:16.600 --> 10:17.840
I tied you up

10:17.960 --> 10:19.550
Send it to Master Cui

10:20.480 --> 10:21.910
Please be honest

10:23.270 --> 10:25.390
On the matter of killing Cui Lin

10:25.510 --> 10:27.030
The positions of you and me

10:27.200 --> 10:28.840
It should be consistent

10:32.550 --> 10:34.440
From Wangzhou to Luoyang

10:35.150 --> 10:37.080
There should be quite a few of my cousins

10:37.240 --> 10:38.270
I'll cause you trouble

10:38.630 --> 10:40.000
without him

10:40.320 --> 10:41.790
You have the food and grass

10:41.960 --> 10:42.440
This city

10:42.550 --> 10:44.000
You have already taken it

10:44.270 --> 10:45.000
General Pei

10:45.600 --> 10:46.870
Haven't you ever thought about it?

10:47.030 --> 10:47.790
Cutting off the roots

10:47.910 --> 10:49.630
Get rid of this serious problem?

10:53.000 --> 10:54.480
I can assure you below

10:54.600 --> 10:55.870
Wait until Cui Lin dies

10:56.120 --> 10:57.840
This Cui family army is under my control

10:58.000 --> 11:00.030
When the time comes, I will definitely support the emperor’s grandson

11:00.320 --> 11:03.000
Take the lead of Zhenxi Army and look forward to it

11:07.440 --> 11:08.550
After it's done

11:08.870 --> 11:10.550
Luoyang is under my control

11:10.870 --> 11:11.550
how

11:13.320 --> 11:14.790
Open your mouth and ask for Luoyang

11:15.510 --> 11:16.870
You have a big appetite

11:18.390 --> 11:19.550
General Pei

11:19.960 --> 11:22.000
This Luoyang is after restraint

11:22.120 --> 11:24.080
Chinzei military service available for direct entry

11:24.200 --> 11:25.360
Go straight to Naxi Changjing

11:25.550 --> 11:26.440
By then

11:26.750 --> 11:28.120
You can kill Sun Jing

11:28.240 --> 11:29.030
That traitor

11:29.240 --> 11:31.630
The whole world belongs to the emperor's grandson

11:31.840 --> 11:33.840
Naturally, the Dayu Dynasty can be restored

11:34.270 --> 11:36.200
I will still care then

11:36.360 --> 11:37.600
Is it just a Hangdu?

11:38.870 --> 11:39.750
Yeah

11:42.200 --> 11:45.030
That's it, it's settled

11:46.240 --> 11:47.150
I'm bold

11:47.270 --> 11:49.720
I also want to ask the general for a token

11:51.030 --> 11:52.150
What token

11:54.030 --> 11:56.270
I would also like to trouble you to write a handwritten letter from the emperor’s grandson.

11:56.440 --> 11:57.670
After everything is done

11:57.840 --> 11:59.600
That Luoyang is controlled by me

11:59.750 --> 12:00.360
how

12:03.750 --> 12:04.720
Little General Pei

12:05.360 --> 12:06.360
What does this mean

12:07.120 --> 12:08.120
Cui Gongzi

12:09.000 --> 12:11.030
I want His Royal Highness’s handwriting

12:11.360 --> 12:13.240
We also have to see if we can kill Cui Lin.

12:13.910 --> 12:15.360
You didn't do anything

12:15.480 --> 12:16.790
I just want handwriting

12:17.240 --> 12:18.720
I'm afraid it's not appropriate.

12:20.440 --> 12:20.840
yes

12:21.150 --> 12:21.910
Yes Yes Yes

12:22.120 --> 12:23.080
The general is right

12:24.240 --> 12:25.000
Not as good as this

12:25.150 --> 12:25.600
Below

12:25.670 --> 12:27.630
Go and get Cui Lin’s men first.

12:28.630 --> 12:29.600
After everything is done

12:29.750 --> 12:31.440
Then ask for tokens from the emperor’s grandson

12:31.720 --> 12:32.670
How about this

12:33.790 --> 12:35.200
Let’s talk about it then

12:39.200 --> 12:40.270
Such a villain

12:40.550 --> 12:41.720
Cui Lin must be informed

12:41.960 --> 12:43.080
Let him be careful

12:43.360 --> 12:44.000
Jushichiro

12:44.150 --> 12:45.320
I know what you are going to say

12:47.750 --> 12:49.390
But I still want to be upright

12:49.840 --> 12:51.670
Fight him on the battlefield

12:52.360 --> 12:53.670
I don't want to see him

12:54.030 --> 12:55.600
Injured by a villain's hidden arrow

13:04.240 --> 13:05.080
peach girl

13:07.030 --> 13:07.630
peach girl

13:08.150 --> 13:09.120
This is Shishiro

13:09.270 --> 13:10.240
To Captain He

13:12.720 --> 13:13.870
There's also this

13:14.670 --> 13:15.720
This is what I give you

13:17.910 --> 13:19.030
What's this

13:19.870 --> 13:20.550
pig ear

13:20.910 --> 13:21.600
I ran several streets

13:21.750 --> 13:22.270
Just bought it

13:22.440 --> 13:23.200
Still hot

13:24.600 --> 13:25.480
I do not want

13:26.320 --> 13:28.510
But didn’t you say that last time?

13:28.630 --> 13:29.870
do you like eating it

13:30.750 --> 13:32.600
I don’t want to eat it now

13:38.270 --> 13:38.790
What's wrong

13:40.120 --> 13:41.600
I have been with the captain these days

13:41.750 --> 13:42.910
Lived outside the city

13:44.270 --> 13:44.840
You feel

13:45.000 --> 13:46.510
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

13:46.960 --> 13:48.000
No no

13:48.120 --> 13:49.200
The medicine you gave me is quite good

13:49.320 --> 13:50.720
I was itchy for two days and it was fine.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.120
this is for you

13:59.510 --> 14:00.750
Apply three times a day

14:01.000 --> 14:02.720
This time the medicine is guaranteed to be effective

14:03.390 --> 14:04.270
Thank you Miss Peach

14:12.000 --> 14:13.120
What what?

14:14.120 --> 14:15.200
Pig ears

14:15.720 --> 14:17.630
This girl suddenly wants to eat again

14:18.840 --> 14:19.360
Give

14:28.360 --> 14:30.670
The girl’s family is so strange

14:33.150 --> 14:33.750
school lieutenant

14:36.240 --> 14:37.440
Letter from His Royal Highness the Emperor

14:38.240 --> 14:39.750
Why are you so happy?

14:41.630 --> 14:42.270
No

14:42.550 --> 14:43.670
What do I have to be happy about?

14:43.910 --> 14:46.630
Isn't it because of the ears?

14:48.240 --> 14:49.870
What ears?

14:50.080 --> 14:51.320
Aren't those pig ears?

14:52.240 --> 14:53.200
school lieutenant

14:53.720 --> 14:54.440
make fun of me

14:54.600 --> 14:55.480
I won't let you eat

14:57.030 --> 14:57.790
Aying

14:58.480 --> 15:00.320
I heard there are rebels in the Cui family army

15:00.550 --> 15:01.960
Desire to kill Mr. Cui

15:02.390 --> 15:03.750
Possible conspiracy

15:04.270 --> 15:06.080
You and the young master, please pay more attention to your left and right sides.

15:06.750 --> 15:07.870
Cherish it again after farewell

15:08.480 --> 15:09.390
from today

15:09.510 --> 15:10.240
Add another bodyguard

15:10.390 --> 15:11.080
Protect the young master

15:11.360 --> 15:13.440
The march to Yingzhou is complicated.

15:13.630 --> 15:14.270
Be sure to protect it

15:14.440 --> 15:15.030
Prince's safety

15:15.200 --> 15:15.630
yes

15:15.790 --> 15:16.790
My subordinates will make arrangements now.

15:18.790 --> 15:19.320
Aying

15:19.910 --> 15:20.630
Why did I suddenly remember

15:20.790 --> 15:21.910
I need to increase my bodyguards

15:22.150 --> 15:24.000
The young master received a tip

15:24.200 --> 15:25.480
Cui Li wants to be unfavorable to the young master

15:25.870 --> 15:26.960
Our army is about to break camp

15:27.120 --> 15:28.000
The prince's safety

15:28.120 --> 15:29.150
It must be the top priority

15:29.320 --> 15:31.080
Ying, don’t worry about me

15:31.670 --> 15:33.000
Continuous marches are hard work

15:33.120 --> 15:34.390
You think too much

15:34.510 --> 15:35.720
You should take good care of yourself

15:35.870 --> 15:37.720
It is my duty to consider the young master

15:38.390 --> 15:39.080
You

15:41.630 --> 15:42.320
peach

15:42.480 --> 15:43.440
help me get this letter

15:43.600 --> 15:44.670
Leave it to Xie Changer

15:47.440 --> 15:48.000
What's wrong

15:48.440 --> 15:50.120
You've been making fun of me lately

15:50.440 --> 15:51.720
I won't send you any more letters

15:53.550 --> 15:55.030
You don’t want to send the letter?

15:55.150 --> 15:56.720
Still don’t want to see Xie Changer

15:57.030 --> 15:57.390
I

15:57.550 --> 15:57.870
I

15:59.150 --> 16:00.390
What if it's the latter?

16:00.550 --> 16:02.080
So I have it on the letter

16:02.240 --> 16:03.200
Add one more sentence

16:03.360 --> 16:04.080
tell them

16:04.240 --> 16:05.910
Let Lao Bao come to deliver letters from now on.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.150
Don't mess with our peach girl

16:07.320 --> 16:07.840
unhappy

16:10.000 --> 16:11.080
look at you

16:11.120 --> 16:13.320
Then they are all the same.

16:13.510 --> 16:15.030
It doesn’t matter who gives it to you

16:15.240 --> 16:16.270
Let me do it

16:16.440 --> 16:17.440
Then you go early and come back early

16:17.630 --> 16:18.840
Don't bully your ears

16:20.510 --> 16:22.030
Who bullied him?

16:24.550 --> 16:25.550
Hard-spoken

17:01.150 --> 17:03.480
The emperor's grandson is asleep

17:04.070 --> 17:05.590
Captain He will never come again

17:05.680 --> 17:06.680
I'm afraid I'll have to sleep until night

17:06.830 --> 17:07.640
Just woke up

17:08.510 --> 17:10.240
All over the place

17:10.400 --> 17:12.000
Where is Shi7ro really?

17:12.160 --> 17:13.440
You can all be at ease

17:13.590 --> 17:15.720
It’s because the breeze at this moment is like a fan

17:15.880 --> 17:17.160
Grass and trees are fragrant

17:44.960 --> 17:45.960
You fell asleep

17:46.590 --> 17:47.550
Fell asleep

17:51.440 --> 17:53.000
why do you want to remind me

17:53.750 --> 17:54.510
Cui Li

17:54.680 --> 17:56.480
It will be detrimental to our young master.

17:59.030 --> 18:00.640
Because I reminded you

18:00.790 --> 18:02.640
You will definitely reply and come to see me

18:07.240 --> 18:08.790
If I were to choose

18:08.960 --> 18:10.510
I won’t ask you to meet me

18:11.880 --> 18:13.680
Then I'll ask you to meet

18:42.070 --> 18:44.030
I'm going back to Yingzhou

18:44.590 --> 18:48.400
I promised you a good farewell

19:14.750 --> 19:15.750
It's raining

19:17.510 --> 19:18.440
take you somewhere

19:19.310 --> 19:19.720
OK

19:33.310 --> 19:34.110
Unexpectedly, the emperor's grandson

19:34.510 --> 19:35.880
We also prepared such a room

19:36.830 --> 19:38.480
That's natural

19:50.200 --> 19:51.510
Fortunately, I have this house to take shelter from the rain

19:51.680 --> 19:52.240
otherwise

19:52.350 --> 19:53.030
We will become drowned chickens

19:53.160 --> 19:54.680
The emperor's grandson looks like a drowned rat

19:54.790 --> 19:56.030
It's not like I haven't seen it before

19:56.960 --> 19:57.750
What a coincidence

19:57.920 --> 19:59.200
The girl looks like a drowned rat

19:59.350 --> 20:00.510
I've seen it a few times

20:20.440 --> 20:22.880
The fragrance is refreshing and slightly bitter in the mouth.

20:23.070 --> 20:24.270
A different flavor

20:24.830 --> 20:27.270
Is this bamboo leaf tea?

20:27.510 --> 20:28.240
That's right

20:28.880 --> 20:29.640
What about the folk?

20:29.790 --> 20:32.160
Bamboo leaves are often used as a decoction instead of tea.

20:33.640 --> 20:35.350
The status of the emperor's grandson is so valuable

20:35.510 --> 20:38.270
But he knows country life well

20:39.830 --> 20:41.110
Is this life alive?

20:41.550 --> 20:42.270
Identity or something

20:42.400 --> 20:43.440
least worth mentioning

20:44.240 --> 20:45.720
So what if you are the emperor?

20:46.160 --> 20:48.240
It’s not just a bowl of rice and a cup of tea

20:48.550 --> 20:49.110
I think

20:49.270 --> 20:50.510
Be a farmer here

20:51.200 --> 20:52.240
Live more happily

20:53.240 --> 20:54.550
but have you ever thought about

20:55.400 --> 20:56.790
If the emperor has no way

20:57.440 --> 20:59.240
Farmers are displaced

20:59.830 --> 21:00.830
Even a simple meal

21:01.030 --> 21:02.270
It has become a luxury

21:02.920 --> 21:04.480
What's the point of having fun?

21:14.480 --> 21:15.030
do not know either

21:15.240 --> 21:16.270
Is there a bowl of rice here?

21:16.480 --> 21:16.960
can fill

21:17.160 --> 21:18.680
The belly of our farmer

21:19.030 --> 21:20.240
All ready

21:22.720 --> 21:23.550
This is also good

21:29.070 --> 21:29.590
This won't work

21:32.640 --> 21:33.550
I'm not good at cooking

21:33.720 --> 21:35.030
If you don't mind

21:35.440 --> 21:36.240
I'll show you my hands

21:36.920 --> 21:38.510
Seventeen Lang cooks himself

21:38.720 --> 21:39.960
How dare I despise it?

21:40.510 --> 21:41.440
but

21:42.310 --> 21:44.440
I don't seem to know much about anything

21:46.240 --> 21:47.030
Make a fire

21:47.240 --> 21:48.400
I should be able to light a fire

21:48.480 --> 21:50.000
Okay, that's it.

21:51.590 --> 21:52.480
Let me take a look

21:59.880 --> 22:00.680
Unexpectedly, the emperor's grandson

22:00.680 --> 22:02.440
Prepared such comprehensive ingredients

22:03.240 --> 22:05.110
I'm afraid you're hungry

22:08.400 --> 22:09.920
You really know how to cook

22:10.270 --> 22:11.310
What's this

22:11.720 --> 22:12.880
We are at Laolan Pass

22:13.160 --> 22:14.880
Laundry, Hunting, Sewing and Cooking

22:15.030 --> 22:16.030
Don’t you do it all by yourself?

22:17.480 --> 22:19.160
Then when you were in Laolan Pass

22:19.310 --> 22:20.510
Didn't you bring a maid?

22:21.110 --> 22:22.510
If I want to bring a maid with me

22:22.680 --> 22:23.240
With me in Kyoto

22:23.310 --> 22:24.000
Life in the palace

22:24.160 --> 22:24.880
What's the difference

22:27.200 --> 22:28.510
As the grandson of the emperor

22:28.680 --> 22:29.720
But I don’t like the palace

22:29.880 --> 22:31.400
A life of luxury and good food

22:31.750 --> 22:32.920
That's interesting

22:38.790 --> 22:39.510
And me

22:39.720 --> 22:41.440
He is an evil son born in the evil moon

22:42.270 --> 22:43.720
Since childhood, the late emperor and his father

22:43.880 --> 22:44.880
don't like me

22:45.550 --> 22:46.920
Such fine clothes and fine food

22:47.680 --> 22:48.510
It’s okay not to

23:02.440 --> 23:03.590
Turn on the bellows and light the fire

23:05.240 --> 23:05.640
good

23:06.790 --> 23:08.000
set fire to fire

23:08.160 --> 23:09.350
It's what I'm best at

23:18.270 --> 23:19.590
Pulling boxes to light a fire

23:19.830 --> 23:21.350
You also need to pay attention to skills

23:21.960 --> 23:23.830
Push it in slowly

23:24.030 --> 23:25.240
Then slowly pull it out

23:25.440 --> 23:27.110
Push it in slowly and pull it out

23:27.160 --> 23:27.680
anything else

23:27.830 --> 23:28.270
Let me try

23:28.640 --> 23:29.790
The heat is very particular

23:29.960 --> 23:31.070
Don’t be big and small suddenly

23:31.270 --> 23:31.750
Dishes cooked like this

23:31.880 --> 23:32.550
It doesn't taste good

23:33.000 --> 23:33.960
Do not worry

23:36.510 --> 23:36.830
Come

24:15.920 --> 24:17.640
Here comes the rice.

24:19.750 --> 24:20.200
Eat

24:23.240 --> 24:24.440
Such a crude person

24:24.680 --> 24:25.750
You even went to pick wild flowers?

24:26.480 --> 24:29.030
This is a humble house, but I am virtuous and kind.

24:29.350 --> 24:30.110
Jushichiro

24:30.310 --> 24:32.440
You cooked this meal seriously

24:32.590 --> 24:34.400
How can you deal with it casually?

24:37.640 --> 24:38.590
The food is mediocre

24:38.960 --> 24:39.790
I feel wronged to you

24:44.510 --> 24:45.070
how

24:45.720 --> 24:46.200
tasty

24:47.400 --> 24:48.480
Then you should eat more

24:54.640 --> 24:55.110
You are not afraid

24:55.270 --> 24:56.200
I poisoned the food

24:56.680 --> 24:57.510
Of course I'm afraid

24:58.440 --> 24:59.270
So just now

24:59.550 --> 25:00.510
When I was lighting the fire

25:01.480 --> 25:02.720
Poisonous smoke has been released

25:04.960 --> 25:05.440
imperial grandson

25:06.640 --> 25:08.160
You are now poisoned

25:14.030 --> 25:14.750
this is delicious

25:16.550 --> 25:17.830
This is what I'm good at

25:18.110 --> 25:18.510
Come

25:20.070 --> 25:21.440
Eat more of this

25:24.270 --> 25:24.680
tasty

25:26.000 --> 25:26.310
Come

25:53.920 --> 25:54.720
Smash it for me

25:54.880 --> 25:56.310
Smash this vixen's nest

25:57.480 --> 25:58.070
stop

26:00.550 --> 26:01.400
Stop it

26:05.960 --> 26:06.750
Mrs. Wei

26:06.920 --> 26:07.960
This is the harem

26:08.110 --> 26:09.350
How can I allow you to be so presumptuous here?

26:09.550 --> 26:11.350
You also know this is the harem

26:11.750 --> 26:13.350
Then she, the former princess

26:13.550 --> 26:15.270
Why are you still in this harem?

26:16.200 --> 26:18.110
It's you vixen

26:18.350 --> 26:19.270
Charming Governor

26:19.440 --> 26:20.400
Disaster for the country and the people

26:20.550 --> 26:22.680
It was you who caused my brother to be captured

26:23.000 --> 26:23.920
I have to tear it apart today

26:24.070 --> 26:25.310
You vixen is not allowed

26:25.480 --> 26:26.510
Give me back my brother

26:26.680 --> 26:27.310
open

26:28.110 --> 26:29.270
I kill you

26:29.590 --> 26:30.350
Give me the governor and let me go

26:30.720 --> 26:31.680
Tell my brother to let me go

26:31.680 --> 26:33.550
I have to kill you today

26:34.350 --> 26:36.070
The governor has arrived

26:37.510 --> 26:38.350
let me go

26:55.000 --> 26:55.640
Someone coming

26:56.480 --> 26:57.590
Mrs. Wei is sick

26:58.070 --> 26:58.790
Help her down

26:59.110 --> 27:00.200
Call the doctor quickly

27:00.400 --> 27:00.960
yes

27:01.160 --> 27:01.830
Grand Governor

27:02.750 --> 27:03.350
let me go

27:03.510 --> 27:04.070
Grand Governor

27:05.000 --> 27:05.400
Grand Governor

27:05.590 --> 27:06.550
Everybody stand down

27:06.790 --> 27:08.200
Grand Governor

27:09.400 --> 27:10.310
how

27:11.510 --> 27:12.590
You are hurt

27:17.350 --> 27:18.640
I feel wronged to you

27:22.640 --> 27:24.070
I am not wronged

27:25.880 --> 27:27.960
I had known it would be today

27:29.200 --> 27:30.480
How could I be wronged?

27:35.110 --> 27:37.720
I've been thinking about it these days

27:39.070 --> 27:39.790
then

27:40.000 --> 27:41.830
If I take you away

27:42.550 --> 27:44.310
What would that be like?

27:47.440 --> 27:48.720
Think back to the beginning

27:50.070 --> 27:52.240
I am at the Ten Mile Pavilion outside the city

27:53.070 --> 27:54.830
I've been waiting for you all day

27:56.160 --> 27:57.640
until the sun goes down

27:58.070 --> 27:59.510
I didn’t see you coming either

28:01.160 --> 28:01.920
I knew it

28:02.110 --> 28:03.680
you will never come again

28:08.000 --> 28:08.880
Although at that time

28:09.070 --> 28:11.110
I have been chosen as the Crown Princess

28:13.480 --> 28:15.510
But as long as you are willing to take me away

28:16.240 --> 28:16.880
I can

28:17.030 --> 28:18.590
I'll fly away with you

28:19.480 --> 28:20.680
incognito

28:21.640 --> 28:23.920
Even if they are a poor and humble couple

28:24.960 --> 28:26.510
I'm happy with it too

28:35.270 --> 28:36.590
I failed you

28:36.790 --> 28:37.480
No

28:38.400 --> 28:39.640
I know too

28:40.310 --> 28:42.110
You have a noble mother

28:42.480 --> 28:44.240
I have a weak younger brother and younger sister

28:45.400 --> 28:47.590
If you really take me away

28:48.240 --> 28:51.270
That is the grave crime of being executed by a whole family.

28:52.640 --> 28:54.720
I am guilty now

28:56.790 --> 28:57.920
But just think of it

28:58.030 --> 28:59.790
the days with you

29:00.270 --> 29:01.750
Even if it's stolen

29:02.200 --> 29:03.960
As long as I can be with you

29:04.590 --> 29:05.830
No matter who scolds me

29:06.000 --> 29:07.070
Still spurn me

29:07.750 --> 29:09.720
I'm so happy

29:38.110 --> 29:39.070
General Han

29:41.960 --> 29:43.830
We are now far from West Changjing

29:44.000 --> 29:46.270
Is it already very far away?

29:49.550 --> 29:51.270
Already thousands of miles away

29:51.920 --> 29:53.510
Just a galloping horse

29:54.030 --> 29:55.510
It will take more than ten days

29:58.680 --> 30:00.720
The last thing my mother-in-law told me was

30:00.920 --> 30:02.640
Aze, run away quickly

30:02.830 --> 30:04.110
The further away the better

30:04.750 --> 30:06.310
But General Han

30:06.480 --> 30:07.880
I don't want to run away anymore

30:08.240 --> 30:09.920
I am the eldest son of the prince

30:10.070 --> 30:11.550
I am the grandson of the imperial dynasty

30:12.110 --> 30:13.110
but now

30:13.400 --> 30:15.750
I feel like a mouse every day

30:16.110 --> 30:17.880
Hiding in Tibet

30:24.960 --> 30:26.640
I told His Highness

30:26.830 --> 30:28.680
The story of General Han Xin

30:29.350 --> 30:31.510
I also told the story of Gou Jian, King of Yue.

30:32.310 --> 30:34.030
Your Highness is taking refuge now.

30:34.440 --> 30:35.510
endure humiliation

30:35.960 --> 30:37.030
Only then can we have a future

30:37.240 --> 30:38.790
A day to regain the mountains and rivers

30:39.030 --> 30:40.160
That day you said

30:40.350 --> 30:42.000
Commander of the Zhenxi Army Li Ying

30:42.200 --> 30:43.720
He's my seventeenth cousin

30:44.110 --> 30:46.550
The Zhenxi Army has already left Laolan Pass

30:46.720 --> 30:48.200
Killed all the way to Wangzhou

30:49.000 --> 30:50.200
Brother Seventeen leads the troops

30:50.400 --> 30:51.640
Still pretty awesome

30:51.880 --> 30:53.480
I really want to be like him

30:53.680 --> 30:55.070
Confront the enemy head on

30:55.270 --> 30:56.480
fight

30:58.310 --> 31:01.510
The seventeen emperors' grandsons indeed made remarkable achievements in battle

31:03.790 --> 31:05.830
But the Zhenxi Army was originally a government soldier

31:06.510 --> 31:08.750
Pei Xian was not close to the former prince

31:09.510 --> 31:11.240
Your Highness has a distinguished status now

31:11.640 --> 31:13.200
Even if they are blood relatives

31:13.880 --> 31:15.350
Don't believe it easily

31:16.510 --> 31:18.000
What's more, His Royal Highness the King of Liang

31:18.240 --> 31:20.310
He was also detained in West Changjing by Sun Jing

31:21.310 --> 31:23.400
I'm just afraid that Li Yi might have some concerns

31:24.160 --> 31:25.550
Thinking a lot

31:26.920 --> 31:27.920
General Han

31:28.270 --> 31:29.720
Then when will we

31:29.920 --> 31:31.640
Only then can we return to Xichangjing

31:32.200 --> 31:33.590
There will be that day

31:34.750 --> 31:36.440
I will definitely escort His Highness

31:36.750 --> 31:38.200
Return to West Changjing

31:38.830 --> 31:42.030
majestic and majestic

31:45.400 --> 31:46.960
Since Sun Jing raised his army

31:47.270 --> 31:48.920
After I left Pingliang

31:49.640 --> 31:50.240
never again

31:50.350 --> 31:51.750
Such an afternoon

31:52.480 --> 31:53.960
can be so comfortable

31:56.350 --> 31:58.400
Being able to be with my best friend under the roof

31:58.550 --> 31:59.790
Enjoy the leisurely mood of rain

32:00.160 --> 32:01.110
More rare

32:06.160 --> 32:07.110
few days ago

32:07.350 --> 32:08.920
I still dream about returning to Laolan Pass

32:09.350 --> 32:11.270
I shot a particularly fat yellow sheep

32:11.750 --> 32:12.510
It's roasting

32:12.790 --> 32:13.790
Awakened from the dream

32:17.270 --> 32:18.590
I'm curious

32:18.960 --> 32:22.240
Is Laolan Pass really that good?

32:22.640 --> 32:25.160
It’s worth remembering you so much

32:26.030 --> 32:27.480
traces of no-go

32:27.920 --> 32:29.110
Living without a house

32:29.510 --> 32:30.640
Isn't it satisfying?

32:32.200 --> 32:33.680
I invite you to join me in the future

32:33.830 --> 32:34.590
Go to Laolan Pass

32:34.790 --> 32:35.720
would you like

32:43.200 --> 32:44.880
You clearly know this is a dream

32:46.790 --> 32:49.750
The tree wants to be still but the wind doesn’t stop

32:52.270 --> 32:53.240
Jushichiro

32:54.400 --> 32:56.030
With your current status

32:56.720 --> 32:58.200
Can I leave everything behind

32:59.160 --> 33:00.550
Return to the frontier

33:01.400 --> 33:02.830
Do you live that kind of life?

33:22.790 --> 33:24.240
It's rare to have a good rain

33:24.480 --> 33:25.750
Trapping you and me here

33:26.200 --> 33:27.070
after the rain stops

33:27.590 --> 33:28.790
It's time to go our separate ways again

33:29.400 --> 33:30.440
let's talk about something else

33:36.510 --> 33:39.030
Okay then

33:39.550 --> 33:40.590
Tell me about you

33:41.720 --> 33:42.880
when you were little

33:43.070 --> 33:44.640
Are you particularly naughty?

33:46.830 --> 33:47.830
More than naughty

33:47.960 --> 33:49.160
Simply naughty

33:49.960 --> 33:51.160
My father beat me with the cane

33:51.270 --> 33:52.790
I don’t know how many roots were broken.

33:53.920 --> 33:55.440
It seems that His Highness Prince Liang

33:55.550 --> 33:56.960
This painstaking discipline

33:57.070 --> 33:59.110
This has little effect.

33:59.960 --> 34:01.240
I'm not afraid of getting beaten

34:01.510 --> 34:02.590
I'm afraid of nagging

34:04.310 --> 34:05.510
When my mother gave birth to me

34:05.960 --> 34:06.960
Died in childbirth

34:07.590 --> 34:08.920
Throughout the palace

34:09.070 --> 34:09.800
Only Princess Dong

34:09.920 --> 34:11.150
Take great care of me

34:12.070 --> 34:13.590
My father doesn’t like me

34:14.800 --> 34:16.000
my two brothers

34:16.550 --> 34:18.070
All relying on father's favoritism

34:18.360 --> 34:19.920
I always get beaten up

34:20.840 --> 34:21.920
It’s been a long time

34:22.280 --> 34:23.710
My father hates me even more

34:24.190 --> 34:25.510
You frown when you see me

34:26.590 --> 34:27.880
Unexpected

34:28.800 --> 34:30.280
Are you still being bullied like this?

34:32.840 --> 34:34.150
My two brothers

34:34.590 --> 34:36.190
All were born to Princess Dong

34:37.400 --> 34:38.070
My mother is Princess Dong

34:38.190 --> 34:39.440
The maid next to me

34:40.030 --> 34:41.440
I heard that I was not favored in the past.

34:42.070 --> 34:42.840
Fortunately, Princess Dong

34:42.960 --> 34:44.480
Take great care of my mother

34:45.400 --> 34:46.880
After my mother-in-law passed away

34:47.670 --> 34:49.320
It was Princess Dong who raised me again

34:50.190 --> 34:51.360
for the princess

34:52.190 --> 34:52.920
I'm okay with everything

34:53.000 --> 34:54.440
Don't argue with your brothers

34:59.440 --> 35:01.150
you are a kind hearted person

35:02.030 --> 35:03.710
Others are kind to you

35:05.550 --> 35:07.150
You will repay ten points

35:08.190 --> 35:09.000
later

35:11.320 --> 35:12.480
Princess Dong died of illness

35:16.800 --> 35:18.440
I'm at home with nothing to worry about

35:19.510 --> 35:21.230
I’m also tired of living in Kyoto

35:23.190 --> 35:25.190
I would rather guard the border and defend my homeland.

35:27.070 --> 35:28.630
So I thought of a way

35:29.000 --> 35:30.070
Went to Laolan Pass

35:32.190 --> 35:33.230
the day i left

35:35.230 --> 35:36.230
My father and brothers

35:36.360 --> 35:37.510
All very happy

35:39.150 --> 35:39.960
The wet nurse is the only one

35:40.070 --> 35:41.440
Send me with tears

35:42.550 --> 35:43.440
Where's the nanny?

35:43.960 --> 35:45.550
Are you still in the palace now?

35:47.550 --> 35:48.630
she is older

35:49.030 --> 35:50.070
As soon as I left the palace

35:50.360 --> 35:51.590
Then send her back to her hometown

35:51.710 --> 35:52.760
Enjoy your family in peace

35:54.760 --> 35:56.320
Fortunately, I left Kyoto

35:57.030 --> 35:59.760
Just long time no see

36:00.630 --> 36:02.630
I wonder if she is healthy and well

36:09.400 --> 36:11.190
Is there still someone I can remember?

36:12.400 --> 36:13.880
You won't feel lonely

36:17.880 --> 36:19.800
My grandma also passed away a long time ago

36:21.070 --> 36:22.030
I can barely remember it

36:22.150 --> 36:23.230
her look

36:24.960 --> 36:26.550
But every time I think of her

36:27.630 --> 36:29.280
I feel like she is accompanying me

36:31.030 --> 36:32.480
I won't feel lonely anymore

36:36.550 --> 36:38.000
What kind of person were you when you were a child?

36:38.510 --> 36:39.630
I really can't imagine it

36:40.400 --> 36:41.190
I guess

36:41.360 --> 36:42.960
You must be a big brat

36:43.280 --> 36:44.480
Extremely difficult, right?

36:49.150 --> 36:49.670
i grew up

36:49.760 --> 36:51.280
He was raised as a boy

36:52.030 --> 36:53.400
Reading and practicing martial arts

36:53.800 --> 36:55.510
No different from other boys

36:56.510 --> 36:57.760
What do boys learn?

36:58.480 --> 37:00.230
I will learn better than them

37:04.110 --> 37:05.510
Your parents forced you to

37:06.190 --> 37:06.590
No

37:07.440 --> 37:08.590
It's my own free will

37:11.630 --> 37:12.590
I am a girl

37:13.510 --> 37:14.960
The ambition is the same as that of a man

37:15.800 --> 37:17.400
Should have put in more effort

37:19.000 --> 37:20.710
OK OK

37:47.000 --> 37:49.960
OK OK

37:50.030 --> 37:52.150
They all wake up at three o'clock and go to bed at five o'clock.

37:52.590 --> 37:53.840
Sweat more than others

37:53.920 --> 37:55.360
Bleed even more

37:56.670 --> 37:57.840
sometimes too tired

37:58.030 --> 37:59.030
injured

37:59.590 --> 38:00.800
Even if it's very hard

38:00.920 --> 38:02.150
I will also endure it silently

38:02.510 --> 38:04.280
I don’t even want anyone to know

38:17.320 --> 38:18.440
what are you thinking about

38:23.230 --> 38:24.110
I'm thinking

38:25.150 --> 38:26.000
If only we had known each other earlier

38:26.110 --> 38:26.840
Enough

38:30.190 --> 38:30.960
Why

38:36.920 --> 38:38.800
This way we can practice martial arts together

38:39.320 --> 38:40.230
Read together

38:40.630 --> 38:41.550
fight together

38:42.070 --> 38:43.000
Nothing to do

38:43.510 --> 38:45.000
Can we still chat like this?

39:20.510 --> 39:21.550
The rain stopped so quickly

39:49.320 --> 39:50.070
Let's go back

39:52.110 --> 39:52.550
good

41:03.360 --> 41:05.960
I have to say goodbye after seeing you for thousands of miles.

41:06.480 --> 41:07.230
Let's go back

41:07.630 --> 41:09.110
I'll give you another ride

41:29.110 --> 41:29.840
Aying

41:30.360 --> 41:31.320
these twenty years

41:31.880 --> 41:32.670
i have never had

41:32.670 --> 41:34.150
Like this afternoon

41:34.150 --> 41:35.230
Peace and joy

41:36.190 --> 41:37.190
Me too

41:38.760 --> 41:40.030
Wait until the world is at peace

41:40.800 --> 41:43.400
You and I are traveling together side by side

41:44.320 --> 41:45.360
It’s a deal
