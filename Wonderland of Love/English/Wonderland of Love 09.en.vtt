01:48.790 --> 01:49.590
Luoyang

01:50.120 --> 01:51.120
The city has strong walls and high walls

01:51.430 --> 01:52.280
Easy to defend but difficult to attack

01:52.640 --> 01:53.840
And there's that Fu Yuan'er

01:54.150 --> 01:55.200
Although he is a general

01:55.350 --> 01:56.710
But he is Sun Jing’s old subordinate

01:56.950 --> 01:58.640
Always loyal to Sun Jing

01:59.120 --> 02:00.040
So Shichiro

02:00.230 --> 02:02.200
Siege is the next best strategy

02:02.920 --> 02:04.040
And our neighbors

02:04.230 --> 02:05.790
And Cui Jiajun is watching with eager eyes.

02:05.950 --> 02:07.480
What if our siege fails?

02:07.760 --> 02:09.080
Will be attacked from both sides

02:10.080 --> 02:10.960
Luoyang City is not

02:11.080 --> 02:11.960
No flaws

02:12.590 --> 02:14.560
Sun Jing’s brother-in-law Zheng Guogong

02:14.750 --> 02:16.280
Aren't you supervising the battle in Luoyang City?

02:17.030 --> 02:18.280
This person has great ambition but little talent

02:18.400 --> 02:20.080
And he has always been at odds with Fu Yuan'er

02:20.520 --> 02:21.150
I read

02:21.910 --> 02:22.710
He is Luoyang City

02:22.800 --> 02:24.080
The biggest flaw

02:26.960 --> 02:27.560
Jushichiro

02:28.000 --> 02:29.240
A secret envoy was sent to Luoyang City

02:29.520 --> 02:30.000
want to see you

02:34.190 --> 02:34.590
please

02:40.840 --> 02:42.430
Mr. Fu came here alone

02:43.000 --> 02:44.120
So brave indeed

02:48.430 --> 02:49.960
The emperor's grandson has received the award

02:50.400 --> 02:51.560
Fu Mou has no other

02:52.000 --> 02:53.520
Only be brave

02:57.680 --> 03:00.430
You must be Pei Xian’s youngest son, right?

03:00.680 --> 03:02.470
Thinking about your father and I back then

03:02.870 --> 03:04.310
Lead the troops together

03:04.430 --> 03:05.870
When conquering Yiluo

03:06.120 --> 03:07.800
Are you still breastfeeding?

03:09.150 --> 03:10.280
Fu Gong more than ten years ago

03:10.400 --> 03:11.590
During the expedition against Yiluo

03:12.120 --> 03:13.800
Break into the king's tent single-handedly

03:13.910 --> 03:15.400
Take the head of King Yiluo directly

03:16.030 --> 03:18.030
Li Yi was young at that time

03:18.310 --> 03:19.710
Just listen to it as a story

03:20.120 --> 03:21.520
Now I can see real people

03:21.680 --> 03:23.030
Only then did we know that Mr. Fu was brave

03:23.120 --> 03:24.520
Just like a story

03:24.960 --> 03:25.710
old

03:26.150 --> 03:27.400
Not to mention the courage back then

03:27.560 --> 03:30.710
The Seventeenth Lang is the young hero

03:30.840 --> 03:31.840
in front of seniors

03:32.030 --> 03:33.280
How dare you talk about Yingjie?

03:33.680 --> 03:34.190
please

03:40.840 --> 03:42.710
Zhenxi Army and Cui Jiajun

03:42.840 --> 03:44.400
Things in Bingzhou

03:45.000 --> 03:46.310
I've heard about it all

03:46.870 --> 03:47.710
This Han Li

03:48.190 --> 03:49.800
Since it was obtained by the emperor’s grandson

03:49.910 --> 03:51.750
Then why not build Jianzhou City

03:51.870 --> 03:54.190
Also filed into the bag together

03:54.470 --> 03:55.680
Instead, let the Cui family

03:55.800 --> 03:57.190
Got a big advantage

03:59.630 --> 04:00.520
Our Zhenxi Army

04:00.870 --> 04:01.630
Unlike Cui Jiajun

04:01.750 --> 04:03.030
So rich

04:03.310 --> 04:04.120
So we can only take Jianzhou

04:04.240 --> 04:05.150
in exchange for food and grass

04:05.560 --> 04:06.960
I'm helpless too

04:07.590 --> 04:10.560
The emperor's grandson doesn't want to vent his anger

04:10.630 --> 04:12.680
Bring the Cui family's food and supplies

04:12.960 --> 04:13.800
Take it away

04:14.560 --> 04:15.840
Mr. Fu is afraid he has forgotten

04:16.630 --> 04:18.630
Why did I come to Luoyang City with troops?

04:22.390 --> 04:26.390
The emperor's grandson wants Luoyang

04:28.190 --> 04:29.720
Fu knew it well

04:29.830 --> 04:30.560
only

04:30.750 --> 04:33.720
At present, the Zhenxi Army is short of food and grass.

04:34.160 --> 04:36.630
With no men and horses, they stormed Luoyang.

04:37.000 --> 04:37.920
But it is

04:38.430 --> 04:40.920
Making wedding clothes for Cui Jiajun in vain

04:41.510 --> 04:44.750
The emperor and grandson haven't had enough of this.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.680
Everyone in this world is Tao Fu Gong

04:48.800 --> 04:50.070
Brave and unrivaled

04:50.800 --> 04:51.830
did not expect

04:52.000 --> 04:53.310
This divorce plan is useful

04:53.430 --> 04:54.560
So clever too

04:55.070 --> 04:56.480
Although it is a estrangement

04:57.190 --> 04:58.560
It's also true

04:59.120 --> 05:01.190
The emperor's grandson is not taking action at this moment

05:01.480 --> 05:04.680
Should he just let Cui Yi become more powerful?

05:04.920 --> 05:06.600
reap the benefits of being a fisherman along the way

05:06.720 --> 05:08.430
Eventually become a thorn in his side

05:09.360 --> 05:13.190
Could it be that Cui Yi is better than the Governor?

05:13.310 --> 05:15.070
It's better to get along with him

05:15.630 --> 05:18.240
Mr. Fu, if you have something to say, you might as well say it directly.

05:21.560 --> 05:23.360
Now the two armies are on the border

05:23.870 --> 05:26.430
Fu was deeply favored by the Governor

05:27.510 --> 05:29.950
With the emperor's current military strength,

05:30.190 --> 05:32.000
To conquer Luoyang City

05:32.120 --> 05:33.480
no easy task

05:34.270 --> 05:35.600
Not within three days

05:35.720 --> 05:37.000
Defeat his Cui family army

05:37.240 --> 05:38.480
Once it's done

05:38.750 --> 05:40.360
Fu immediately offered it

05:40.480 --> 05:42.270
Half of the food and grass in the city

05:43.240 --> 05:47.120
The Zhenxi Army only needs to circle the city and pass by.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.560
Fu will never stop him

05:56.310 --> 05:58.040
The emperor's grandson may wish to consider

05:58.720 --> 06:00.920
It won’t be too late to give me an answer tomorrow

06:06.310 --> 06:06.800
good

06:09.070 --> 06:11.870
I'll take my leave first.

06:14.390 --> 06:15.390
I've ordered people to prepare it

06:15.480 --> 06:16.800
Thirty carts of grain and grass

06:17.040 --> 06:18.680
Can be delivered tonight

06:19.190 --> 06:21.950
As a gift for me during this trip

06:22.750 --> 06:23.720
Mr. Fu is not afraid

06:23.830 --> 06:25.160
After I collected the food and grass

06:25.480 --> 06:26.950
Turn around and attack Luoyang

06:30.240 --> 06:31.750
Thirty carts of grain and grass

06:31.870 --> 06:33.800
I can still afford it

06:34.270 --> 06:35.040
Farewell

06:46.160 --> 06:47.800
Han Li, this idiot

06:48.600 --> 06:49.560
Didn't expect it to be so fast

06:49.630 --> 06:51.430
Just throw it away and build two states

06:52.920 --> 06:54.870
I thought he had been in business for many years

06:55.430 --> 06:56.950
At least the energy consumption is enough to suppress the Western Army

06:57.070 --> 06:58.270
Great loss of vitality

06:58.800 --> 07:01.920
I didn't expect him to find it useful.

07:03.390 --> 07:05.310
Zhenxi Army and Cui Jiajun join forces

07:05.720 --> 07:07.040
Han Li is invincible

07:08.120 --> 07:08.830
now

07:08.950 --> 07:10.750
The Zhenxi Army must point its sword at the Luoshui River

07:10.950 --> 07:12.430
Let’s fight against Baiyue’s army

07:12.560 --> 07:13.750
Is it temporary

07:13.870 --> 07:15.120
Withdraw some first

07:17.680 --> 07:18.800
Southern Expedition to Baiyue

07:18.870 --> 07:21.000
It is a major event of opening up a new territory

07:22.000 --> 07:23.750
Li's Yu Dynasty for a hundred years

07:24.120 --> 07:26.510
After several expeditions over hundreds of countries, they were all defeated and returned.

07:26.800 --> 07:30.040
If I could pacify Baiyue

07:30.800 --> 07:32.750
Then the world will be convinced

07:33.480 --> 07:33.950
yes

07:34.360 --> 07:35.680
But now the war situation is critical

07:35.680 --> 07:36.510
Recruitment

07:37.560 --> 07:40.040
Then recruit more troops from all walks of life.

07:40.240 --> 07:41.360
Although Li Yi was able

07:41.630 --> 07:43.160
But his troops are limited

07:43.950 --> 07:45.070
It's Wai

07:45.560 --> 07:46.070
I want him too

07:46.240 --> 07:47.870
Trapped to death by the bank of Luoyang

07:52.000 --> 07:53.830
Or wine from the Western Regions?

07:54.870 --> 07:55.560
Jushichiro

07:55.950 --> 07:57.360
You said this Fu Yuan'er

07:57.720 --> 07:59.360
That's really cunning.

07:59.680 --> 08:00.630
This is a divorce tactic

08:00.750 --> 08:01.950
Use it openly and honestly

08:02.070 --> 08:02.950
We don’t even have room to refute

08:03.070 --> 08:03.870
nothing

08:07.720 --> 08:08.950
This Fu Yuan'er

08:09.720 --> 08:11.120
Such generals

08:11.430 --> 08:12.800
Courageous and resourceful

08:12.950 --> 08:15.000
But he is only loyal to Sun Jing

08:16.120 --> 08:16.870
it's a pity

08:18.430 --> 08:19.070
Jushichiro

08:19.510 --> 08:21.160
You say what he just said

08:21.430 --> 08:23.870
How much is true and how much is false?

08:27.510 --> 08:28.240
Tomorrow morning

08:29.510 --> 08:30.720
Reply to Fu Yuan'er

08:30.870 --> 08:31.800
Just say I agreed

08:32.390 --> 08:32.910
What

08:33.440 --> 08:35.120
You promised him to fight Cui Jiajun

08:35.720 --> 08:36.510
Take my place again

08:36.910 --> 08:38.550
Also reply to Cui Jiajun

08:39.870 --> 08:40.870
What are you going to do again?

08:41.960 --> 08:42.510
Don't take advantage of this

08:42.630 --> 08:44.270
Before the big fight

08:45.320 --> 08:46.630
Take advantage

08:46.750 --> 08:49.240
Even the capital and profits are taken back

08:50.790 --> 08:51.870
Lord, you can't go there

08:52.000 --> 08:52.510
I am Zheng Guogong

08:52.630 --> 08:53.150
Mr. Fu is sick

08:53.270 --> 08:53.790
You all get out of here

08:53.910 --> 08:54.390
dog slave

08:54.550 --> 08:55.120
Duke

08:55.360 --> 08:56.390
I want to see Fu Yuan'er

08:56.510 --> 08:57.080
Duke

08:57.360 --> 08:58.360
Hello Fu Yuan'er

08:58.480 --> 09:00.240
Defiant, rebellious and arrogant

09:00.360 --> 09:01.600
It’s been half a month since I returned to Luoyang

09:01.720 --> 09:02.870
You've been pretending to be sick and not seeing me

09:03.000 --> 09:04.120
what do you mean you

09:08.790 --> 09:10.480
I've got the tip

09:11.030 --> 09:12.150
Talk about a few days ago

09:12.270 --> 09:13.200
you alone

09:13.240 --> 09:14.720
Go to Zhenxi Army Camp

09:14.870 --> 09:16.120
I had a private meeting with Li Ni

09:16.480 --> 09:16.870
explain

09:17.550 --> 09:19.120
Are you carrying the Governor on your back?

09:19.270 --> 09:20.670
What's the deal with Li Yi?

09:21.120 --> 09:21.870
That's right

09:23.600 --> 09:24.870
three days ago

09:25.390 --> 09:28.390
I did go to the Zhenxi Army Camp

09:29.240 --> 09:31.000
I also met Li Yi

09:33.030 --> 09:33.750
good

09:34.360 --> 09:35.550
Since you confessed everything

09:35.720 --> 09:37.480
Then quickly hand over your handsome seal.

09:38.840 --> 09:39.750
General Fu

09:39.960 --> 09:40.910
You hold it in your hand

09:41.080 --> 09:42.630
Luoyang military and political power

09:43.200 --> 09:44.670
Wan Yi and Li Yi

09:44.790 --> 09:46.120
Is there anything that should be combined inside and outside?

09:46.240 --> 09:47.720
Wouldn't it be detrimental to the Governor?

09:50.390 --> 09:54.790
Marshal Yin was personally taught by the Grand Governor.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.790
Unless the governor comes in person

09:59.080 --> 10:00.390
Otherwise I wouldn't

10:00.510 --> 10:01.870
Hand over the handsome seal

10:02.000 --> 10:03.630
Clever words to seduce you

10:07.120 --> 10:08.360
I see Li Yi

10:08.510 --> 10:10.790
I want to force him to fight Cui Jiajun

10:11.320 --> 10:14.870
The two armies appeared and marched to Luoshui River

10:15.440 --> 10:16.790
If we join forces

10:18.030 --> 10:21.390
This Luoyang City is very dangerous.

10:24.510 --> 10:26.240
best way

10:27.630 --> 10:29.150
Just let Li Yi

10:29.670 --> 10:31.510
To defeat the Cui family army

10:38.000 --> 10:39.870
Na Zhaofu, old general

10:40.000 --> 10:41.120
If you say so

10:41.240 --> 10:42.720
You really have a way

10:42.840 --> 10:44.870
Let Li Yi defeat the Cui family army but fail

10:46.030 --> 10:47.240
What a coincidence

10:47.960 --> 10:50.030
Li Ning just sent someone to deliver a letter.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.200
It’s not time to say today

10:51.320 --> 10:52.910
Will attack Cui Jiajun

10:53.030 --> 10:55.200
Is Mr. Zheng willing to follow me?

10:55.440 --> 10:57.240
Go to the tower together

10:57.600 --> 10:59.440
Go and see the excitement

11:01.870 --> 11:04.030
Mr. Fu takes a lesson from you and makes a promise to you.

11:04.480 --> 11:06.270
The Cui family's army will attack at the end of the day.

11:06.600 --> 11:08.000
You'd better skim the formation from behind.

11:08.150 --> 11:09.720
How can any coach be a pioneer?

11:10.000 --> 11:11.270
If I don't show up in person

11:11.600 --> 11:12.840
How could Fu Yuan'er believe it?

11:13.630 --> 11:14.240
Moreover

11:14.870 --> 11:16.150
We have to let Cui Jiajun

11:16.320 --> 11:18.030
Look at the strength of our Zhenxi Army

11:36.080 --> 11:36.960
newspaper

11:38.000 --> 11:39.360
The Zhenxi Army has all come out

11:39.480 --> 11:40.550
Kill Cui Jiajun

12:25.510 --> 12:26.510
What are you two fighting here?

12:26.670 --> 12:28.720
Didn't Seventeen Lang say that he was fake?

12:28.840 --> 12:29.910
It makes a difference who you hit

12:30.000 --> 12:31.440
Are you talking nonsense and hitting your own people?

12:31.600 --> 12:32.240
Where to fight Cui Jiajun?

12:32.360 --> 12:33.440
Beat them

12:33.670 --> 12:34.390
Go

12:36.440 --> 12:37.030
hit them

12:39.480 --> 12:39.840
Walk

12:42.720 --> 12:43.030
you

12:56.480 --> 12:57.960
Where are you stepping?

12:58.240 --> 13:00.080
How dare you step on your grandfather's hand?

13:01.870 --> 13:03.120
Aren't you dead?

13:03.790 --> 13:04.840
Where's the fake corpse?

13:05.270 --> 13:06.550
It turns out that you suppressed the Western Army

13:06.670 --> 13:08.320
It's all this kind of bullying and fear of the strong

13:08.440 --> 13:09.750
You're a rat who only knows how to fake corpses.

13:11.080 --> 13:12.240
Brat

13:12.630 --> 13:14.790
Let’s see how grandpa treats you today

13:37.630 --> 13:38.670
It turns out to be you

14:09.910 --> 14:11.320
I saved you again

14:13.320 --> 14:13.750
good

14:13.840 --> 14:15.200
Then I'll pay you back once

14:40.030 --> 14:41.000
Why are these people trying to kill you?

14:41.120 --> 14:42.390
Although these people are all strangers

14:42.550 --> 14:43.270
And try their best to cover up

14:43.390 --> 14:44.480
But I have some guesses in my mind

14:44.630 --> 14:45.360
Jushichiro

14:47.960 --> 14:48.720
Are you okay?

14:49.670 --> 14:50.480
injured

14:51.150 --> 14:52.000
Cui

14:52.150 --> 14:53.080
Didn't you agree to fake a beating?

14:53.240 --> 14:54.030
what happened

14:56.000 --> 14:56.790
I see the fighting ends here

14:56.960 --> 14:57.480
about there

14:59.360 --> 14:59.870
Walk

15:03.320 --> 15:04.150
newspaper

15:06.320 --> 15:07.360
how

15:07.750 --> 15:08.550
Scouts come to report

15:08.720 --> 15:10.150
The Zhenxi Army has defeated the Cui Army

15:10.270 --> 15:11.320
Mr. Cui is injured

15:11.480 --> 15:12.510
Cui Jiajun retreated thirty miles

15:12.630 --> 15:13.360
rearrange

15:13.510 --> 15:14.440
Although the Zhenxi Army won

15:14.550 --> 15:15.550
But the damage was serious

15:15.670 --> 15:17.120
Marshal Li Ni was shot in the leg

15:17.240 --> 15:18.360
Has been carried back to the army

15:19.200 --> 15:19.790
good

15:22.510 --> 15:23.120
General Fu

15:23.550 --> 15:25.320
Everyone says this Li Yi is cunning

15:25.480 --> 15:26.510
Cui Jiajun is brave

15:26.670 --> 15:28.200
I can't see it like this

15:28.600 --> 15:29.200
Not as good as

15:29.360 --> 15:31.150
Let me lead the troops to defeat each one

15:31.270 --> 15:32.750
So that I can report the good news to the Governor

15:33.600 --> 15:34.270
Wait a minute

15:36.720 --> 15:38.320
I promised Li Yi

15:39.200 --> 15:41.240
As long as he defeats Cui Jiajun

15:41.360 --> 15:43.360
Then he gave him half the city's food and grass.

15:43.840 --> 15:46.030
Allow him to go around Luoyang

15:46.670 --> 15:47.440
What

15:48.960 --> 15:49.960
You give him food and grass

15:50.120 --> 15:51.550
You also let him go around the city

15:51.870 --> 15:53.270
Are you going to rebel?

15:53.630 --> 15:54.600
What do you know

15:56.720 --> 15:59.910
Luoyang is the capital of Deng

16:00.360 --> 16:03.360
The terrain and people's hearts are extraordinary

16:04.480 --> 16:05.910
At present, in Luoyang City

16:06.030 --> 16:08.120
Although the army has sufficient food and fodder,

16:08.360 --> 16:09.510
But if it is Cui Jiajun

16:09.670 --> 16:11.510
Join forces with the Zhenxi Army to attack the city

16:11.630 --> 16:13.150
Or besiege Luoyang

16:13.320 --> 16:14.510
Cut off food routes

16:14.720 --> 16:16.200
Isn’t it like setting up Kyoto?

16:16.440 --> 16:18.960
Putting the governor in danger

16:21.510 --> 16:23.030
I see you are afraid of fighting

16:23.200 --> 16:24.240
eloquent words

16:27.840 --> 16:30.600
I risked using tricks to drive a wedge between the Cui family

16:30.720 --> 16:32.080
and the two armies of Zhenxi

16:32.390 --> 16:34.790
Now they both lose

16:35.120 --> 16:39.240
I'm just afraid that there might be a scam here.

16:39.360 --> 16:41.550
They must be lured away from Luoyang first

16:41.910 --> 16:43.600
and then plan

16:43.750 --> 16:47.270
How to divide them and kill them all

17:00.000 --> 17:00.670
It hurts

17:00.790 --> 17:01.360
no pain

17:01.550 --> 17:02.550
Just got there

17:03.080 --> 17:03.750
Aying

17:04.440 --> 17:05.400
Why are you injured?

17:06.400 --> 17:06.880
Young Master

17:06.920 --> 17:07.440
Young Master

17:07.550 --> 17:08.110
fine

17:08.240 --> 17:09.000
I'm not hurt

17:09.640 --> 17:10.790
As long as it's not hurt

17:12.400 --> 17:12.920
Young Master

17:13.830 --> 17:14.750
People from Cui Jiajun

17:15.160 --> 17:16.310
someone wants to kill me

17:18.790 --> 17:19.310
wrong

17:19.550 --> 17:20.720
I was wearing a mask just now

17:20.880 --> 17:22.200
They thought I was you

17:23.480 --> 17:24.750
Someone wants to kill you

17:28.480 --> 17:29.400
What do you think

17:30.480 --> 17:31.550
Who did it?

17:33.830 --> 17:35.440
People from the Cui family army

17:36.270 --> 17:37.110
Can it always be like this

17:37.240 --> 17:39.000
Sparing no effort to target you and me

17:40.310 --> 17:41.350
Who else could it be?

17:44.270 --> 17:46.270
It seems that this Cui Li has been holding back for many years.

17:46.830 --> 17:48.310
I couldn't bear it anymore after all.

17:50.480 --> 17:51.310
Prince, don't worry

17:51.790 --> 17:52.680
I will find a way

17:53.110 --> 17:54.400
Let him not make waves

17:57.440 --> 17:58.030
Jushichiro

18:00.550 --> 18:01.270
Jushichiro

18:01.830 --> 18:02.920
Call me today

18:03.070 --> 18:03.920
No more drinking

18:04.070 --> 18:04.880
Drinking tea instead

18:05.030 --> 18:07.110
Drink a few cups of tea instead of wine

18:13.350 --> 18:14.310
Such good tea

18:14.480 --> 18:15.400
Have a few more drinks

18:16.480 --> 18:17.270
That's not right

18:18.070 --> 18:19.400
Why are you so happy today

18:19.750 --> 18:20.510
happy event

18:25.200 --> 18:27.720
You've got to the point

18:28.200 --> 18:29.510
Where is my friend?

18:29.720 --> 18:31.200
It turns out the girl he likes

18:31.720 --> 18:33.110
Not someone’s concubine

18:34.790 --> 18:36.200
Seventeen Lang you

18:37.960 --> 18:39.350
Your friend

18:39.680 --> 18:41.400
I haven’t let this matter go yet.

18:42.480 --> 18:44.350
A man can afford to take it and put it down

18:44.880 --> 18:46.510
I thought they had cut it off a long time ago

18:47.240 --> 18:47.750
You do not understand

18:48.590 --> 18:50.200
OK, I don’t understand

18:51.350 --> 18:53.030
But anyone with a discerning eye can see it

18:53.200 --> 18:54.830
That Colonel He and Mr. Cui

18:55.000 --> 18:56.110
Close contacts

18:56.270 --> 18:57.830
Even if she's not his concubine

18:58.000 --> 19:00.590
These two people must have an affair

19:04.590 --> 19:05.310
Jushichiro

19:05.550 --> 19:06.720
We and Cui Jiajun

19:06.880 --> 19:08.480
Although they are both teachers of King Qin

19:08.640 --> 19:09.550
But this Cui family

19:09.720 --> 19:11.310
There must be some dissent

19:11.510 --> 19:13.750
It will become a problem for the country and the dynasty in the future.

19:17.310 --> 19:19.240
when did you know

19:19.400 --> 19:20.510
When did you know

19:20.680 --> 19:22.110
Anyone with long eyes can see it

19:22.270 --> 19:23.400
Do you like that Captain He?

19:23.550 --> 19:24.070
Yes or no

19:26.590 --> 19:28.030
Is it so obvious?

19:28.200 --> 19:29.400
I'll be more restrained next time

19:30.510 --> 19:31.510
Why are you going?

19:52.240 --> 19:52.920
school lieutenant

19:53.270 --> 19:53.960
time to eat

19:56.480 --> 19:57.680
time to eat

19:58.070 --> 19:58.550
peach

19:58.960 --> 20:00.640
Help me get the most poisonous poison

20:01.240 --> 20:02.750
The kind that will kill you if you touch your lips

20:02.750 --> 20:03.110
you

20:03.310 --> 20:04.680
What do you want poison for?

20:05.590 --> 20:06.510
Just go get it

20:06.880 --> 20:08.400
Okay, I'll go right away

20:09.070 --> 20:09.750
poison

20:13.920 --> 20:15.240
The most poisonous poison

20:16.110 --> 20:16.640
how

20:17.030 --> 20:18.590
Lieutenant He knew I was coming

20:18.750 --> 20:20.070
You want to kill me and silence me?

20:20.550 --> 20:21.720
The emperor's grandson was injured

20:21.960 --> 20:23.110
Not recuperating in camp

20:23.640 --> 20:24.750
What are you doing here?

20:31.310 --> 20:32.240
before

20:32.400 --> 20:34.000
It's all you who took care of your son

20:34.270 --> 20:35.550
Going into battle to kill the enemy, right?

20:37.200 --> 20:38.350
Of course not

20:38.830 --> 20:40.350
My son is feeling unwell today

20:40.680 --> 20:41.880
I just fought for him

20:52.160 --> 20:53.510
I already know it all

20:54.880 --> 20:55.720
what do you know

20:56.310 --> 20:57.920
I know your identity

21:01.830 --> 21:03.310
Know who I am

21:04.400 --> 21:06.920
I know your identity is actually

21:11.880 --> 21:13.030
I know you actually don’t

21:13.200 --> 21:14.750
She's not Mr. Cui's concubine

21:18.960 --> 21:19.790
I'm not

21:21.000 --> 21:21.720
so what

21:23.750 --> 21:24.960
You're a liar

21:25.070 --> 21:25.750
little liar

21:26.790 --> 21:27.750
Let me discuss something with you

21:28.240 --> 21:29.750
If I catch Zheng Guogong

21:29.920 --> 21:31.110
How about leaving Luoyang to me?

21:31.640 --> 21:32.240
That won't work

21:32.880 --> 21:34.400
Even if you can catch Zheng Guogong

21:34.590 --> 21:35.590
Unless you suppress the Western Army

21:35.750 --> 21:37.160
We don’t need help from Cui Jiajun

21:37.270 --> 21:38.400
We can capture Luoyang

21:38.590 --> 21:41.030
Otherwise Luoyang cannot be yours

21:42.590 --> 21:44.240
The captain brought the poison

21:44.400 --> 21:44.960
we are going

21:45.110 --> 21:46.110
Poisoning the Zhenxi Army

21:46.480 --> 21:47.350
Poisonous?

21:52.790 --> 21:54.680
I'll talk to you about this later

22:04.480 --> 22:05.110
school lieutenant

22:05.680 --> 22:07.310
Why is this Emperor Li here?

22:08.030 --> 22:09.200
What did he tell you?

22:09.350 --> 22:10.880
Why don't we talk about it later?

22:11.240 --> 22:12.240
What happened to you before

22:12.400 --> 22:13.350
Don't hide it from me

22:13.640 --> 22:14.960
You won’t even tell me now

22:15.830 --> 22:17.310
Is this poison still useful?

22:33.790 --> 22:35.070
Cui Jiajun was defeated

22:35.240 --> 22:36.590
Back thirty miles

22:37.070 --> 22:38.070
Yesterday's battle

22:38.240 --> 22:39.790
Live up to Mr. Fu’s expectations

22:40.400 --> 22:42.350
It was a beautiful battle

22:42.920 --> 22:45.350
He is indeed your grandpa’s good son.

22:45.510 --> 22:46.750
Mr. Fu is overly praised

22:47.110 --> 22:48.200
Yesterday's battle

22:48.400 --> 22:49.480
The emperor's grandson was injured

22:49.680 --> 22:51.070
Can't come today

22:51.510 --> 22:52.920
Tell me specifically

22:53.070 --> 22:54.720
Thank you Mr. Fu for the food and grass.

22:55.030 --> 22:57.030
Fu keeps his word

22:57.240 --> 22:59.000
The food and grass promised to him

22:59.270 --> 23:01.240
I will definitely give it to him

23:01.640 --> 23:03.400
Then thank Mr. Fu.

23:03.590 --> 23:04.750
Tell Li Ni

23:05.000 --> 23:07.440
Let him take care of himself

23:08.510 --> 23:09.000
yes

23:26.720 --> 23:27.400
Jushichiro

23:27.590 --> 23:28.270
This is not Fu Yuan'er

23:28.480 --> 23:29.590
Did you promise to give us food?

23:29.750 --> 23:31.160
Why are we still lying in wait here?

23:31.720 --> 23:33.030
I will give it to you later

23:33.200 --> 23:34.350
Do a trick and see

23:35.310 --> 23:36.070
what trick

23:37.720 --> 23:39.240
Just from this food

23:39.750 --> 23:40.550
Change it for you

23:40.680 --> 23:41.880
Duke Zheng comes out

24:00.960 --> 24:01.750
rush

24:07.590 --> 24:08.000
come out

24:08.400 --> 24:09.590
come out faster

24:10.070 --> 24:10.830
Come out

24:11.510 --> 24:11.830
come out

24:16.550 --> 24:16.960
do not move

24:23.590 --> 24:24.200
General Pei

24:24.310 --> 24:26.000
How long will this last?

24:26.160 --> 24:27.000
Enough to eat for a while

24:27.110 --> 24:28.480
I also caught a big fish.

24:28.640 --> 24:29.590
This time, Luoyang City

24:29.790 --> 24:30.480
Safe

24:34.590 --> 24:36.030
This is Sun Jing’s brother-in-law

24:36.240 --> 24:38.000
Zheng Guogong, right?

24:38.160 --> 24:39.510
He doesn’t look very good either.

24:39.510 --> 24:40.110
That's right

24:40.160 --> 24:41.110
What does Sun Jing’s wife look like?

24:41.110 --> 24:41.880
It definitely doesn’t look good either.

24:42.830 --> 24:44.160
I haven't seen the Duke yet

24:44.160 --> 24:45.110
Such a high official

24:46.110 --> 24:47.440
This armor is good

24:47.640 --> 24:48.680
Not bad

24:50.270 --> 24:52.000
Such a high-ranking official can only be killed with a knife

24:52.160 --> 24:53.270
He cried so much

24:54.440 --> 24:56.030
A dear descendant of Luoyang City

24:56.270 --> 24:57.110
Hiding in this grain truck

24:57.310 --> 24:58.590
Want to sneak attack on us

24:58.750 --> 24:59.920
We are still the Seventeenth Lang

25:00.070 --> 25:00.790
Magical plan

25:00.960 --> 25:02.440
Caught them red-handed

25:03.070 --> 25:04.310
Now that Zheng Guogong has been captured,

25:05.160 --> 25:06.510
Then this Luoyang City

25:06.960 --> 25:08.510
It's like it's in our hands

25:09.110 --> 25:09.960
yes

25:09.960 --> 25:11.640
Very good

25:15.110 --> 25:15.960
let me go

25:18.640 --> 25:19.400
let me go

25:19.550 --> 25:20.070
general

25:20.590 --> 25:21.510
Li Ni, Zhenxi Army

25:21.680 --> 25:22.750
Cui Jiajun and Cui Lin encircled

25:23.110 --> 25:23.880
Take Zheng Guogong with you

25:24.030 --> 25:24.920
and his entourage are dear to him

25:25.070 --> 25:25.880
Come to the city

25:26.110 --> 25:27.510
He said he was willing to use Zheng Guogong

25:27.680 --> 25:28.750
and the captured relatives in the city

25:28.920 --> 25:29.720
exchange for city

25:29.830 --> 25:30.830
don't kill me help me

25:31.030 --> 25:31.790
What to change?

25:32.400 --> 25:34.070
Why is Zheng Guogong crooked?

25:34.270 --> 25:35.720
None can compare to Luoyang City

25:37.880 --> 25:39.350
Such rogue things

25:39.510 --> 25:40.510
Only you can control the Western Army

25:40.680 --> 25:41.480
Can do it

25:41.720 --> 25:43.000
Don't look at the scoundrels

25:43.200 --> 25:44.070
But it works

25:44.510 --> 25:45.830
Do you dare to make a bet with me?

25:47.550 --> 25:48.640
I won't bet with you

25:50.680 --> 25:51.960
Hu'er with the surname Fu

25:52.030 --> 25:53.310
Listen to me

25:53.790 --> 25:55.160
Our grandson

25:55.480 --> 25:56.720
Marshal Li said

25:57.240 --> 25:58.750
give you a chance

25:59.240 --> 26:00.240
as long as you open

26:00.400 --> 26:01.640
The gate of Luoyang City

26:01.790 --> 26:03.480
We let Zheng Guogong go

26:03.680 --> 26:05.440
and these dear children

26:05.750 --> 26:06.920
We promise

26:07.200 --> 26:08.920
Don’t take the city’s wealth

26:09.110 --> 26:11.160
Do not harm the people in the city

26:11.640 --> 26:12.440
how is everything

26:12.750 --> 26:15.240
Is this a good deal?

26:19.960 --> 26:23.200
Duke Guo of Zheng is Sun Jing’s brother-in-law

26:23.550 --> 26:25.110
If you don't save him

26:25.310 --> 26:26.720
Sun Jing, that great governor

26:26.880 --> 26:28.350
I won't let you go

26:28.640 --> 26:29.550
put

26:37.640 --> 26:38.510
Shoot an arrow

26:38.920 --> 26:40.310
Shot Zheng Guogong to death

26:40.480 --> 26:41.480
Look at Sun Jing

26:41.590 --> 26:43.070
I won’t chop off your heads

26:45.440 --> 26:46.110
Fu Yuan'er

26:46.960 --> 26:47.880
you are crazy

26:50.960 --> 26:52.550
Farewell Fu Yuan'er

26:54.590 --> 26:56.480
Farewell Fu Yuan'er

26:56.550 --> 26:57.480
Let it go

26:57.510 --> 26:58.640
don't don't don't don't

26:59.270 --> 27:00.110
let it go

27:01.640 --> 27:02.510
Fu Yuan'er

27:03.400 --> 27:04.920
Don't, don't, don't

27:11.920 --> 27:14.030
Fu Yuan'er, you bastard

27:14.550 --> 27:15.350
Fu Yuan'er

27:15.880 --> 27:17.640
You will avenge your private vengeance

27:18.200 --> 27:19.480
Thousands of people in the city

27:19.640 --> 27:20.640
But everyone is watching

27:20.790 --> 27:23.550
The Governor won't let you go

27:26.400 --> 27:27.440
Archery skills are good

27:27.830 --> 27:28.880
If it were a little more biased

27:29.030 --> 27:30.240
Shot Zheng Guogong in the heart

27:30.480 --> 27:31.720
That won't be useful

27:35.110 --> 27:37.030
I have sent people to attack Yingzhou

27:37.960 --> 27:39.720
We can no longer let that old man Cui Yi

27:39.880 --> 27:41.110
Sit back and enjoy the happiness

27:42.550 --> 27:43.680
A good move from the Governor

27:43.830 --> 27:44.830
Surround Wei and rescue Zhao

27:45.880 --> 27:46.640
So Cui Jiajun

27:46.830 --> 27:47.830
We must give up Luoyang

27:48.000 --> 27:48.920
Chijiu Yingzhou

27:49.110 --> 27:51.720
The Zhenxi Army is left alone and unable to fight.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.440
Just beat them all

27:56.030 --> 27:57.550
Send a message to Fu Yuan'er

27:58.240 --> 27:59.830
Zheng Guogong was greedy for power and harmed the country

28:00.000 --> 28:01.110
Death is not a pity

28:01.510 --> 28:02.750
Tell him not to worry

28:03.000 --> 28:04.310
Stick to Luoyang as the top priority

28:04.590 --> 28:05.110
yes

28:06.680 --> 28:08.960
But where is Mrs. Wei?

28:11.720 --> 28:13.270
woman noisy

28:13.440 --> 28:15.110
I'll just ignore it

28:18.160 --> 28:20.000
Li Yi’s two brothers

28:20.200 --> 28:21.790
Are you still in Jiangnan now?

28:22.790 --> 28:23.790
Li Jun and Li Lai

28:24.000 --> 28:25.030
None of them have the talent to lead an army

28:25.110 --> 28:26.550
Still trapped in Jiangnan at this moment

28:26.790 --> 28:27.790
nothing to fear

28:30.680 --> 28:31.960
Let them out

28:33.510 --> 28:34.920
Dadudu means

28:35.750 --> 28:38.000
Three brothers get together

28:38.160 --> 28:39.720
Only then do you know who Kunpeng is

28:39.880 --> 28:41.270
who is bird

28:42.200 --> 28:43.750
Those two birds

28:44.510 --> 28:45.590
How could you open your eyes?

28:45.750 --> 28:47.110
looking at his brother

28:47.350 --> 28:48.750
Spread your wings and fly high

28:50.310 --> 28:51.750
The Governor's clever plan

28:52.240 --> 28:53.110
Since ancient times

28:53.310 --> 28:55.270
There will be no shortage of brothers fighting against each other

28:55.510 --> 28:57.270
Li Yi should also try this

28:57.440 --> 28:58.510
It tastes good

28:58.750 --> 28:59.070
right

29:00.550 --> 29:00.880
Come

29:02.510 --> 29:03.400
Come, come, come

29:04.590 --> 29:06.160
This Sun Jing used his troops strangely

29:06.350 --> 29:07.960
Send a large army to attack Yingzhou

29:08.640 --> 29:10.110
But the main force of Cui Jiajun is here

29:10.310 --> 29:11.200
I'm just afraid of my father's side

29:11.400 --> 29:12.200
Can't last long

29:13.880 --> 29:15.640
Sun Jing is besieging Wei and rescuing Zhao.

29:16.030 --> 29:17.310
Force us to leave Luoyang

29:17.750 --> 29:19.030
I'd better leave and go back to Yingzhou.

29:19.510 --> 29:20.830
It's too late to go back now

29:21.400 --> 29:22.440
What should I do?

29:25.110 --> 29:26.310
The main camp is far away

29:26.720 --> 29:27.920
If we could use the road to Wangzhou

29:28.480 --> 29:29.680
It can be on the way

29:29.880 --> 29:30.960
save a lot of time

29:31.200 --> 29:32.680
It can not only relieve the siege of Yingzhou

29:32.790 --> 29:33.920
We can capture Luoyang again

29:35.350 --> 29:37.110
But Wangzhou is in Li Ni's hands

29:38.750 --> 29:39.960
I'm just afraid that he won't take advantage of it

29:42.750 --> 29:44.200
With our current strength

29:44.480 --> 29:45.270
this matter

29:45.510 --> 29:46.830
There is still room for negotiation

29:47.030 --> 29:47.550
What

29:48.070 --> 29:49.070
Yingzhou is in emergency

29:49.920 --> 29:51.240
The news is very reliable

29:51.440 --> 29:53.160
Sun Jing's army is already on the way

29:53.960 --> 29:54.880
It seems that Cui Jiajun

29:55.070 --> 29:56.070
There will definitely be some action

29:56.400 --> 29:56.920
But they may not

29:57.070 --> 29:58.110
Can you make it to Yingzhou?

29:58.480 --> 30:00.480
If you want to get back in time

30:00.960 --> 30:03.750
Cui Linde needs to take the road to Wangzhou

30:04.440 --> 30:05.310
What do you mean

30:05.750 --> 30:07.200
I want to lend Wangzhou to them

30:13.400 --> 30:14.920
I'll wait for them to change

30:23.920 --> 30:24.680
long ears

30:25.400 --> 30:27.640
You accompany Miss Taozi to find medical books

30:28.270 --> 30:28.750
yes

30:42.160 --> 30:43.440
The magnificence of the capital

30:43.790 --> 30:45.070
Only visible from high altitude

30:47.160 --> 30:48.510
Overlooking Luoyang River

30:49.310 --> 30:50.750
Hu Bing walks in confusion

30:52.880 --> 30:54.200
Blood painted on weeds

30:54.720 --> 30:56.310
The jackal is in full glory

30:59.960 --> 31:01.640
The emperor's grandson borrowed Taibai's poem

31:02.110 --> 31:03.400
Who are you mocking?

31:07.070 --> 31:08.640
I just suddenly felt emotional

31:09.400 --> 31:10.960
The extremely magnificent Dengdu

31:11.350 --> 31:12.790
Now also involved in the war

31:13.480 --> 31:14.550
There is no peace in the years

31:15.310 --> 31:16.590
I don’t know when I can rest

31:21.070 --> 31:22.590
Since the emperor's grandson raised his army,

31:23.030 --> 31:25.880
Then you know that the war is raging

31:26.400 --> 31:27.680
Thousands of bones

31:28.110 --> 31:29.880
Only war can end war

31:30.830 --> 31:32.750
Only then can the world be at peace

31:35.070 --> 31:36.030
I only hope

31:36.480 --> 31:37.200
can be recovered as soon as possible

31:37.400 --> 31:38.640
This half of the river and mountains

31:39.200 --> 31:41.920
Give peace to the people of the world

31:46.640 --> 31:47.640
I also hope that

32:06.550 --> 32:07.790
You told me that day

32:08.110 --> 32:09.480
Want to lend me Cui Jiajun

32:09.680 --> 32:10.680
People in Beijing

32:11.070 --> 32:12.310
Help you rescue Liang Wang

32:14.720 --> 32:15.590
Not impossible

32:18.240 --> 32:19.400
But you have to win me first

32:22.550 --> 32:23.720
Listen to your tone

32:24.110 --> 32:25.480
What other tricks did you come up with?

32:27.270 --> 32:29.480
Is the emperor's grandson willing?

32:30.000 --> 32:31.200
Take a gamble with me

32:35.070 --> 32:36.510
I know the emperor is cautious

32:36.920 --> 32:38.440
Let me make the bet then.

32:39.030 --> 32:40.310
if i win

32:41.200 --> 32:42.880
You want me to use the road to visit the state

32:43.830 --> 32:45.310
if you win

32:45.550 --> 32:46.790
Then I am Cui Jiajun

32:47.000 --> 32:48.110
I will help you rescue King Liang

32:50.200 --> 32:51.920
That sounds fair.

32:52.400 --> 32:53.000
How to bet

32:55.790 --> 32:56.750
How to bet

32:58.720 --> 32:59.750
it's actually really easy

33:00.310 --> 33:01.440
you close your eyes

33:01.680 --> 33:03.480
I count from one to ten

33:03.720 --> 33:05.270
before counting to ten

33:05.400 --> 33:06.110
if you can't help it

33:06.310 --> 33:07.350
opened eyes

33:07.720 --> 33:08.920
Then you lose

33:17.880 --> 33:18.640
You won't try to take advantage of me again

33:18.830 --> 33:19.160
close eyes

33:19.350 --> 33:20.590
Sting me with a needle

33:20.790 --> 33:21.640
rest assured

33:21.790 --> 33:23.070
I will never do anything

33:23.240 --> 33:24.110
things that hurt you

33:24.880 --> 33:25.510
how

33:34.030 --> 33:34.440
bet

33:35.240 --> 33:35.920
But

33:36.830 --> 33:38.160
I want to count myself

33:39.350 --> 33:40.550
Even if you prick me with a needle

33:40.750 --> 33:41.720
I will never open my eyes

33:42.680 --> 33:44.440
Okay, then close your eyes

33:44.640 --> 33:45.550
Count it yourself

33:52.680 --> 33:53.550
one

33:57.070 --> 33:57.880
two

34:02.960 --> 34:04.550
three

34:07.590 --> 34:08.880
Four

34:55.840 --> 34:56.400
you lose

35:23.360 --> 35:24.960
Can I just ignore it?

35:31.190 --> 35:33.710
Can I just ignore it?

36:01.070 --> 36:01.480
Taoist priest

36:01.760 --> 36:04.070
I heard that in the Sutra Collection Pavilion of Taiqing Palace

36:04.150 --> 36:05.840
There is a medical book that is the only one

36:05.960 --> 36:07.320
Can I borrow a list?

36:08.480 --> 36:09.710
The rules set by the ancestor

36:09.880 --> 36:10.760
Books in the Sutra Pavilion

36:10.880 --> 36:11.800
never loan

36:13.230 --> 36:13.880
Taoist priest

36:14.190 --> 36:14.800
I am willing to sincerely

36:14.880 --> 36:16.590
Carrying water and sweeping for the temple

36:16.710 --> 36:17.320
Only the Taoist priest is invited

36:17.400 --> 36:19.110
Can you allow me to borrow from the cabinet?

36:20.670 --> 36:22.320
Carrying water, cleaning, and cleaning are all heavy tasks.

36:22.440 --> 36:23.630
You are a girl's family

36:24.000 --> 36:24.320
I

36:24.480 --> 36:26.190
Taoist priest, I am willing to help her carry water.

36:26.360 --> 36:27.000
Taoist priest

36:27.840 --> 36:28.960
I'm also willing to help her sweep

36:29.030 --> 36:31.070
Taoist priest, I am also willing to help.

36:31.630 --> 36:33.030
Please also ask the Taoist priest for your convenience.

36:34.840 --> 36:37.440
Could you please go fetch some water?

36:38.000 --> 36:38.880
Please both of you

36:38.960 --> 36:40.150
Go to Sasou Tibetan Scripture Pavilion

36:51.630 --> 36:52.800
Miss Peach, let me help you.

36:53.110 --> 36:54.030
That's not okay

36:54.360 --> 36:55.840
You're here to help me work

36:55.920 --> 36:57.400
You're not here to work for me

36:58.110 --> 36:58.760
Also

36:58.880 --> 37:00.070
why do you want to help me

37:00.920 --> 37:02.070
I don't know either

37:02.230 --> 37:04.000
Anyway, as soon as I see you

37:04.070 --> 37:04.710
I just want to help you

37:18.960 --> 37:19.960
Look at the two of you

37:20.070 --> 37:21.320
They are all literate people

37:21.400 --> 37:22.710
I would also like to ask you two to clean up

37:22.880 --> 37:23.800
Cherish books

37:24.230 --> 37:24.710
yes

37:24.960 --> 37:25.480
yes

37:29.400 --> 37:30.320
You take a break

37:30.550 --> 37:31.230
I'll clean it up

37:31.710 --> 37:33.440
Let the emperor and grandson do the work himself

37:33.920 --> 37:35.000
This isn't appropriate, is it?

37:35.670 --> 37:36.840
Since I lost the bet

37:37.190 --> 37:38.710
Let me express my thoughts first

38:48.880 --> 38:49.710
lifelike

38:50.000 --> 38:50.800
What a great painting

38:51.400 --> 38:54.510
This painting is named Huang Sun Lao Tu

38:54.710 --> 38:55.670
how do you feel

38:55.960 --> 38:56.710
Title is better

39:13.800 --> 39:15.760
This must be given to me as a gift

39:19.480 --> 39:20.590
This is what I drew

39:20.840 --> 39:22.030
Why should I give it to you?

39:24.670 --> 39:26.000
But what you drew is clearly me

39:26.110 --> 39:26.920
Nature is mine

39:36.840 --> 39:37.630
why are you laughing

39:37.800 --> 39:38.510
nothing

39:38.760 --> 39:39.760
What are you laughing at me for?

39:39.920 --> 39:41.230
Nothing can be said

39:43.070 --> 39:43.590
Say it quickly

39:43.710 --> 39:44.630
What are you laughing at me for?

39:45.110 --> 39:46.000
If I had said

39:46.070 --> 39:47.030
Don't be angry

39:47.440 --> 39:48.710
Tell me first and listen

39:50.400 --> 39:52.760
And you, put me on your chest

39:53.000 --> 39:54.400
Carry it like this day and night

39:54.510 --> 39:55.000
When I miss you

39:55.110 --> 39:56.480
You can also take it out and take a look

39:56.590 --> 39:57.150
I'm naturally happy

39:57.280 --> 39:58.440
I smile when I'm happy

39:58.920 --> 40:00.320
Glib tongue

40:05.800 --> 40:06.670
Thank you for your gift

40:07.440 --> 40:08.510
you this person

40:09.150 --> 40:10.280
It's so pervasive

40:13.760 --> 40:14.230
alright

40:14.480 --> 40:15.400
Let's get down to business

40:16.230 --> 40:17.440
Since you won the bet

40:17.590 --> 40:18.000
Then I agree

40:18.110 --> 40:19.440
Let you use the road to visit the state

40:19.920 --> 40:21.760
Just how can you promise me

40:21.880 --> 40:22.760
rescue my father

40:23.630 --> 40:25.110
Then you might as well consider it

40:25.110 --> 40:26.320
Help me capture Luoyang

40:27.030 --> 40:28.000
easy to say

40:29.710 --> 40:31.630
Emperor Sun is so sure

40:32.030 --> 40:33.800
We can capture Luoyang now

40:36.590 --> 40:37.550
First of all

40:38.230 --> 40:40.280
You and I join hands with Chen Bing under Luoyang City

40:40.710 --> 40:42.070
There is already a five-point chance of winning

40:42.480 --> 40:43.480
Duke Zheng was captured

40:43.550 --> 40:44.550
7 points chance of winning

40:45.150 --> 40:46.230
Although Fu Yuan'er is brave

40:46.440 --> 40:48.190
But he did not know the political situation in the Ming Dynasty

40:48.630 --> 40:50.320
I don’t even know the plans of those aristocratic families.

40:50.710 --> 40:51.670
9 points chance of winning

40:52.710 --> 40:53.280
This is all already there

40:53.360 --> 40:54.280
Nine points chance of winning

40:54.880 --> 40:55.840
This Luoyang City

40:56.070 --> 40:57.400
Isn’t it all under control?

41:02.190 --> 41:04.030
The emperor and grandson planned for the king of Liang like this

41:04.480 --> 41:05.670
How lucky is the king of Liang

41:09.280 --> 41:10.360
He is my father

41:11.110 --> 41:12.030
Of course I will save him

41:13.920 --> 41:15.190
He is in Sun Jing's hands

41:17.280 --> 41:18.670
I'm afraid we can capture Luoyang

41:19.190 --> 41:20.710
Sun Jing may not be murderous

41:25.800 --> 41:27.070
That's not as good as

41:31.190 --> 41:34.760
Put yourself to death and survive

41:36.630 --> 41:38.360
Put yourself to death and survive

41:40.320 --> 41:41.920
Fu Yuan'er took advantage of the governor's orders

41:42.030 --> 41:42.550
Absolutely not

41:42.670 --> 41:43.920
Save our Duke Zheng Guo

41:44.510 --> 41:46.030
I'm just afraid of all the masters of the house.

41:46.150 --> 41:47.920
Fu Yuan'er won't be able to save him either.

41:48.000 --> 41:48.670
What should I do?

41:48.800 --> 41:49.400
What should I do?

41:49.480 --> 41:50.000
yes

41:50.000 --> 41:51.110
We can't count on Fu Yuan'er anymore

41:51.670 --> 41:52.480
we have to rely on ourselves

41:52.550 --> 41:53.670
Rescue the master

41:53.670 --> 41:54.320
That's right

41:59.510 --> 42:00.510
general general

42:00.590 --> 42:01.230
problem occurs

42:01.960 --> 42:02.550
Come in

42:03.800 --> 42:04.630
Zheng Guogong's family

42:04.630 --> 42:05.480
private army

42:05.510 --> 42:06.550
Knocked out the city gate guard

42:06.630 --> 42:07.360
Opened the city gate

42:07.510 --> 42:08.440
Lead the Western Army and Cui Jiajun

42:08.510 --> 42:09.030
Entering the city

42:09.110 --> 42:09.670
What

42:11.440 --> 42:12.230
completion

42:14.320 --> 42:15.630
It's all over

42:16.510 --> 42:18.400
these idiots

42:19.280 --> 42:21.760
I didn’t expect this Luoyang City

42:21.880 --> 42:23.760
perished in their hands

42:23.880 --> 42:26.110
I'm gonna kill these idiots

42:26.760 --> 42:28.440
Died in battle

42:32.960 --> 42:33.760
Get food first

42:33.880 --> 42:34.960
Don't worry, Shichiro

42:35.510 --> 42:38.070
Zhenxi Army Cui Jiajun surrounded and attacked Luoyang

42:38.400 --> 42:40.510
It is difficult to storm the city after being besieged for many days

42:40.710 --> 42:42.190
Li Ni used clever tactics

42:42.190 --> 42:44.480
Order Zheng Guogong to open the city gate privately

42:44.630 --> 42:47.480
Only then did Cui Jiajun of the Zhenxi Army sneak into Luoyang.

42:47.630 --> 42:49.230
Fu Yuan'er rose up to resist

42:49.360 --> 42:51.480
Leading the defenders to fight hard for two days and one night

42:51.800 --> 42:52.920
Finally lost

44:04.280 --> 44:06.670
I owe the governor my life

44:07.510 --> 44:09.670
Originally I wanted to defend Luoyang

44:11.760 --> 44:13.320
Come in exchange for this life

44:14.440 --> 44:15.480
did not expect

44:20.110 --> 44:21.400
Luoyang has been lost

44:23.800 --> 44:24.670
It seems

44:26.510 --> 44:28.480
Today I can only take this life

44:31.920 --> 44:33.630
Gave it back to the Governor

45:02.510 --> 45:03.590
very good

45:04.400 --> 45:05.760
Great

45:07.960 --> 45:09.800
The future world

45:12.030 --> 45:13.280
It's you who are waiting

45:13.400 --> 45:15.070
young heroes

45:19.150 --> 45:23.150
Wait until you and him

45:23.320 --> 45:25.670
When fighting for the world

45:27.070 --> 45:30.400
How wonderful that would be

45:34.840 --> 45:35.920
pity

45:38.000 --> 45:39.710
I can't see it anymore
