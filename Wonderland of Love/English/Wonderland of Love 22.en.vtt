01:46.495 --> 01:48.415
Anyone here?

01:51.536 --> 01:53.215
There is someone there?

01:53.935 --> 01:55.976
Anyone here?

01:58.495 --> 02:01.016
How could you tie me here
for three days and three nights?

02:03.176 --> 02:04.495
Who did it?

02:04.495 --> 02:06.295
Anyone here?

02:12.656 --> 02:13.336
Señor,

02:13.816 --> 02:14.895
I'm going to die of thirst

02:15.015 --> 02:16.216
give me some water, please.

02:24.936 --> 02:25.855
Señor,

02:27.096 --> 02:28.216
why guys

02:28.216 --> 02:29.096
bind this tree?

02:29.615 --> 02:31.015
As long as you leave me free,

02:31.415 --> 02:32.816
I give you

02:32.976 --> 02:34.096
all my family assets.

02:34.270 --> 02:35.695
The Cui Army led by my uncle is also

02:35.695 --> 02:36.656
known as the Army of Victory.

02:36.656 --> 02:37.256
Never...

02:43.455 --> 02:44.536
¿You?

03:04.336 --> 03:05.575
¿ Cui Lin?

03:07.575 --> 03:08.695
He didn't die, huh?

03:10.415 --> 03:11.816
I'm not Cui Lin.

03:13.895 --> 03:14.735
Lin,

03:15.615 --> 03:17.135
I'm glad you're still alive.

03:19.216 --> 03:20.056
Lin,

03:20.615 --> 03:22.015
I'm happy to see you alive!

03:23.096 --> 03:24.656
I already told you.

03:24.735 --> 03:25.895
I'm not Cui Lin.

03:26.256 --> 03:27.735
Yeah.

03:27.976 --> 03:28.895
No.

03:28.936 --> 03:29.895
You are not Cui Lin.

03:30.135 --> 03:31.256
You are not Cui Lin.

03:32.175 --> 03:33.656
My name is Liu Chengfeng.

03:34.976 --> 03:36.175
Have you remembered that?

03:37.455 --> 03:38.895
Yes, I do.

03:39.096 --> 03:40.615
You are Young Master Liu Chengfeng.

03:40.615 --> 03:41.455
Master Liu.

03:42.376 --> 03:43.376
Young Master Liu.

03:44.295 --> 03:45.695
Young Master Liu, I beg you.

03:45.816 --> 03:47.175
I'm willing to do anything.

03:47.175 --> 03:47.855
Young Master Liu.

03:48.455 --> 03:50.096
Young Master Liu, trust me.

03:50.096 --> 03:51.536
Please free me,

03:51.656 --> 03:52.656
Young Master Liu.

04:08.096 --> 04:08.976
they,

04:10.096 --> 04:11.376
¿ La gente de Jieshuo?

04:12.656 --> 04:13.895
You are not Cui Lin.

04:14.096 --> 04:15.575
You are definitely not Cui Lin.

04:16.950 --> 04:19.656
The Cui family has a deep resentment
against the Jieshuo people.

04:20.055 --> 04:21.615
Anyone with the last name Cui

04:21.620 --> 04:23.450
He will never make acquaintances
with the people of Jieshuo.

04:25.216 --> 04:25.896
It's true.

04:26.776 --> 04:28.136
Soy Liu Chengfeng.

04:28.776 --> 04:30.055
I'm not Cui Lin.

04:33.456 --> 04:35.495
Do you know
what you swallowed just now?

04:36.456 --> 04:37.776
It is a poison pill manufactured by

04:37.776 --> 04:39.576
the witch doctors of Jieshuo.

04:40.336 --> 04:42.295
If you don't follow my instructions,

04:42.696 --> 04:44.735
If you don't take
the antidote on time,

04:45.656 --> 04:47.495
your body will break.

04:53.096 --> 04:54.175
Young Master Liu!

04:55.735 --> 04:57.375
Please don't hold it against me!

04:57.615 --> 05:00.055
I'm willing to do anything for you

05:00.175 --> 05:02.896
as long as you let me live!

05:02.896 --> 05:03.495
Young Master Liu!

05:03.495 --> 05:05.656
I'm willing to do anything!

05:09.016 --> 05:10.976
As long as you obey my will

05:11.696 --> 05:13.615
and follow my instructions,

05:15.976 --> 05:18.055
I will give you the antidote.

05:20.536 --> 05:21.776
Thank you, Young Master Liu.

05:22.735 --> 05:23.896
Thank you, Young Master Liu.

05:24.576 --> 05:25.896
Thank you, Young Master Liu.

05:27.656 --> 05:28.295
Taozi,

05:28.815 --> 05:29.456
I gathered these

05:29.456 --> 05:30.456
in the mountains for you.

05:30.615 --> 05:31.255
They are nice.

05:31.255 --> 05:32.415
They smell very good.

05:34.255 --> 05:34.896
By the way,

05:35.016 --> 05:36.255
How is Mr. Shiqi?

05:37.336 --> 05:38.336
Don't mention that.

05:38.495 --> 05:39.576
Great General

05:39.576 --> 05:41.216
He has freed him from jail.

05:41.415 --> 05:42.656
However, he gave him 30 lashes

05:42.815 --> 05:44.216
(Wolong)
according to military rules.

05:44.255 --> 05:44.976
That?

05:45.096 --> 05:46.136
30 lashes?

05:47.336 --> 05:48.576
However,

05:48.576 --> 05:49.776
lord Qin

05:49.776 --> 05:51.175
He is a tough man indeed.

05:51.415 --> 05:52.855
I was not willing

05:52.976 --> 05:53.896
pray to Great General

05:53.896 --> 05:55.615
even after receiving
all that punishment.

05:56.615 --> 05:57.576
That's the way

05:57.576 --> 05:58.495
he is.

05:59.495 --> 06:01.016
He will never give up until death.

06:02.536 --> 06:04.055
Actually, Great General

06:04.055 --> 06:05.576
It's soft too.

06:05.735 --> 06:08.415
Lord Qin wouldn't need to suffer so much

06:08.415 --> 06:10.055
if you made an exception in the first place.

06:14.935 --> 06:16.536
Since you collected these,

06:17.656 --> 06:18.656
You should have some too.

06:19.175 --> 06:19.656
Alright.

06:19.656 --> 06:20.855
You can have them all if you want.

06:20.855 --> 06:21.815
This is good.

06:24.216 --> 06:24.735
GOOD.

06:27.656 --> 06:28.855
I see.

06:30.336 --> 06:31.576
What do you mean?

06:32.696 --> 06:33.696
The entire Cui army

06:33.696 --> 06:34.855
acts the same way.

06:35.120 --> 06:36.710
Hard on the outside,
but soft on the inside.

06:38.776 --> 06:40.055
Be careful, I'm very fierce.

06:40.336 --> 06:42.096
Yes Yes. You are fierce.

07:06.415 --> 07:07.249
Great General,

07:07.250 --> 07:09.270
We have already cleared
the front of the battlefield.

07:09.270 --> 07:10.255
We brought the prisoners back.

07:10.255 --> 07:11.640
Now, we are doing an inventory check.

07:20.656 --> 07:21.536
Yeah,

07:22.255 --> 07:25.096
Shouldn't I have done it?

07:26.615 --> 07:27.415
Padre,

07:27.855 --> 07:28.896
what's happening?

07:30.216 --> 07:31.536
When you were born,

07:31.815 --> 07:33.216
I told the imperial court

07:33.696 --> 07:35.255
that you were a boy

07:35.976 --> 07:36.976
When you grew up,

07:37.456 --> 07:39.696
Liu Chengfeng replaced you as Cui Lin

07:39.815 --> 07:41.136
and he became my son.

07:43.336 --> 07:44.935
You are a lady.

07:45.055 --> 07:46.615
But you ride horses

07:46.776 --> 07:48.216
and fight battles at my side.

07:48.855 --> 07:49.896
How I can

07:51.055 --> 07:53.175
get a husband in the future?

07:55.735 --> 07:57.375
Those who are willing to marry you

07:57.495 --> 07:59.456
It will definitely have all kinds of defects.

07:59.815 --> 08:00.855
Forget about you,

08:00.870 --> 08:02.230
I won't even like it.

08:02.935 --> 08:04.935
Father, what are you saying?

08:05.055 --> 08:06.415
I like going to war.

08:06.495 --> 08:07.776
I like to live this way.

08:08.230 --> 08:09.735
There are many men in the world.

08:09.896 --> 08:11.055
I can do everything

08:11.055 --> 08:12.295
They do it.

08:12.456 --> 08:14.016
Why should I get married then?

08:15.576 --> 08:16.896
You are a lady after all.

08:17.175 --> 08:19.096
They will get married
and give birth eventually.

08:21.735 --> 08:22.935
Actually,

08:23.935 --> 08:25.495
feng is pretty good too.

08:26.136 --> 08:27.255
He...

08:28.295 --> 08:29.175
Padre,

08:29.295 --> 08:30.576
the world is huge

08:30.576 --> 08:31.656
and vast.

08:31.815 --> 08:32.775
There are many places

08:32.775 --> 08:33.976
that I haven't been yet.

08:34.056 --> 08:35.015
There are many things

08:35.015 --> 08:36.495
I want to experience it for myself.

08:36.735 --> 08:38.735
Yes, get married and give birth

08:38.855 --> 08:40.655
It is one of the experiences,

08:40.816 --> 08:42.655
There is nothing wrong with omitting it.

08:42.830 --> 08:44.576
It's just one of thousands of experiences

08:44.576 --> 08:46.015
i will experience

08:46.495 --> 08:48.416
Someday I'm going to grow old.

08:48.470 --> 08:49.895
Eventually we will have to part ways.

08:50.015 --> 08:51.816
By then, you will be alone.

08:53.056 --> 08:54.456
I'll feel too embarrassed

08:55.615 --> 08:57.576
to face your mother in the afterlife.

09:00.735 --> 09:01.495
Padre,

09:01.855 --> 09:02.855
I have driven

09:03.015 --> 09:04.895
a happy and carefree life.

09:05.495 --> 09:06.816
When you see the mother

09:06.936 --> 09:08.296
in the other life,

09:08.456 --> 09:09.775
just tell her

09:10.895 --> 09:12.735
that this was my favorite way of life.

09:13.135 --> 09:13.976
I think that

09:14.096 --> 09:15.096
mom will be happy

09:15.255 --> 09:16.416
when he hears it.

09:16.775 --> 09:18.135
There is nothing more satisfying

09:18.416 --> 09:21.895
That leaving your daughter
leads a happy and carefree life, right?

09:32.735 --> 09:33.456
Great General,

09:33.470 --> 09:35.495
The scouts we sent
have discovered a suspect.

09:35.655 --> 09:38.015
They found Cui Li's footprints.

09:40.015 --> 09:41.135
Don't let

09:41.895 --> 09:43.696
Lieutenant He finds out.

09:44.416 --> 09:45.416
Deploy our troops.

09:45.570 --> 09:46.655
I'm going there personally.

09:47.015 --> 09:48.096
Yes, Great General.

09:56.936 --> 09:57.895
Young Master Liu.

09:58.056 --> 09:59.655
Cui Yi will be here later.

10:00.375 --> 10:01.495
Do you still remember

10:01.735 --> 10:02.615
what do you have to say?

10:02.735 --> 10:03.615
Yes, Young Master Liu.

10:03.615 --> 10:04.855
Yes I remember my verses.

10:05.615 --> 10:06.535
Young Master Liu,

10:06.936 --> 10:07.735
Yes, I do

10:08.015 --> 10:09.655
play my part in your act,

10:09.895 --> 10:11.696
will you give me the antidote

10:12.096 --> 10:13.375
so I can survive?

10:21.936 --> 10:22.615
Young Master Liu,

10:22.615 --> 10:23.216
Don't worry.

10:23.416 --> 10:24.976
I will definitely do my part well.

10:25.135 --> 10:25.976
Yeah.

10:26.135 --> 10:26.936
Don't worry.

10:28.535 --> 10:29.615
Reporting!

10:30.750 --> 10:32.495
Great General,
we have surrounded the forest.

10:32.495 --> 10:34.290
Cui Li has escaped
into the forest with his men.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.096
It completely surrounds the forest.

10:36.696 --> 10:38.096
Don't let him escape.

10:38.096 --> 10:38.696
Yeah!

10:43.535 --> 10:44.416
Do not get close to me!

10:45.056 --> 10:46.096
Everyone, stay!

10:46.220 --> 10:47.790
I'll kill him
if you take one step closer!

10:47.816 --> 10:48.696
Do not come here!

10:49.936 --> 10:51.255
Comes back!

10:59.576 --> 11:00.416
Uncle.

11:01.936 --> 11:02.655
Do not move!

11:15.296 --> 11:16.535
Uncle!

11:24.375 --> 11:25.936
Man, I had no choice!

11:26.816 --> 11:27.775
Let go.

11:28.096 --> 11:28.895
Uncle,

11:29.615 --> 11:31.056
I had no choice!

11:34.255 --> 11:35.696
Dude, don't come near me!

11:36.296 --> 11:37.576
Don't force me to do it!

11:38.895 --> 11:40.096
Lower your sword.

11:41.176 --> 11:43.216
He is still my nephew.

11:43.655 --> 11:44.735
But,

11:45.096 --> 11:47.816
You can't forgive yourself
for what you've done.

11:48.735 --> 11:49.696
Uncle,

11:50.255 --> 11:52.135
I had no choice!

11:52.375 --> 11:54.015
Li Ni forced me to do this!

11:54.176 --> 11:56.176
He said he would kill me
if I didn't kill Lin!

11:56.416 --> 11:57.456
That's why I put on an act

11:57.470 --> 11:58.976
and forced Lin to jump into the river.

11:59.775 --> 12:01.056
But once they were gone,

12:01.176 --> 12:02.216
I went downstream

12:02.216 --> 12:03.216
and saved Cui Lin.

12:03.336 --> 12:04.655
I even treated his wounds!

12:05.976 --> 12:06.855
Uncle!

12:07.015 --> 12:08.096
Uncle!

12:13.696 --> 12:14.895
Let go!

12:15.056 --> 12:16.976
Dude, don't make me!

12:35.216 --> 12:36.535
Let go!

12:53.655 --> 12:54.416
Fuego.

13:05.576 --> 13:07.096
I win!

13:07.495 --> 13:08.296
Padre,

13:08.296 --> 13:09.375
because I have

13:09.375 --> 13:10.696
to practice this all the time?

13:11.976 --> 13:13.816
Because you are my daughter.

13:14.230 --> 13:15.489
The people of Jieshuo are ruthless.

13:15.490 --> 13:17.110
If they take you
hostage one day,

13:17.336 --> 13:19.456
I hope I can save you

13:19.535 --> 13:20.456
with my bow and arrow.

13:28.096 --> 13:28.816
Come here.

13:32.535 --> 13:34.015
Father, can I join too?

13:34.015 --> 13:34.735
Clear.

13:34.735 --> 13:36.135
You are my son too.

13:36.296 --> 13:37.416
We can do this training

13:37.576 --> 13:38.816
for as long as you want.

13:39.135 --> 13:40.936
Thanks, Dad!

13:40.936 --> 13:42.936
Why do you thank me?
Come, let me show you.

13:46.615 --> 13:47.255
Fuego.

14:18.820 --> 14:19.380
Untie him.

14:19.390 --> 14:20.260
- Yes
Yes.

14:24.056 --> 14:25.216
I already told you.

14:26.535 --> 14:27.775
could save you

14:28.416 --> 14:30.936
if you step on the sword.

14:32.336 --> 14:33.296
But,

14:34.735 --> 14:36.976
I have to take you down
according to military rules.

14:38.855 --> 14:39.495
they,

14:46.535 --> 14:47.576
What did you say?

14:50.535 --> 14:51.176
they,

14:52.576 --> 14:53.135
they...

15:18.895 --> 15:19.576
Your Highness.

15:19.735 --> 15:21.056
Why don't you let me do it?

15:21.056 --> 15:21.980
You should resume your work.

15:22.015 --> 15:22.735
Don't worry.

15:22.936 --> 15:24.735
I'll make sure this soup doesn't boil over too much.

15:24.936 --> 15:25.855
But the heat is too much...

15:25.855 --> 15:26.456
Taozi.

15:27.456 --> 15:28.096
Come here.

15:28.096 --> 15:28.976
It's not that. I...

15:35.735 --> 15:36.535
Don't scratch it.

15:37.976 --> 15:38.775
will never heal

15:38.936 --> 15:40.456
if you keep scratching it.

15:40.920 --> 15:42.456
But you don't help me
apply medicine.

15:42.576 --> 15:43.696
I can't reach it myself.

15:43.696 --> 15:44.655
Of course it will sting.

15:44.895 --> 15:46.456
I'm doing it to teach you a lesson.

15:46.456 --> 15:48.270
I'll see if they dare
to repeat it next time.

15:48.416 --> 15:49.775
Next time? No, thanks.

15:50.135 --> 15:51.056
It's hard to say.

15:51.056 --> 15:52.056
You are a dense man.

15:52.056 --> 15:53.176
I am sure that Father

15:53.176 --> 15:54.456
He will be angry when he sees you.

15:54.456 --> 15:56.855
Maybe I'll hit you again next time.

15:58.775 --> 16:00.416
We can talk about it then.

16:00.696 --> 16:01.456
I think that

16:01.735 --> 16:03.296
The soup is almost ready.

16:04.375 --> 16:05.416
Try it.

16:08.976 --> 16:10.096
Let me get a big one.

16:11.615 --> 16:12.735
Blueberries.

16:15.296 --> 16:16.735
And red dates.

16:24.176 --> 16:24.816
All finished.

16:25.176 --> 16:25.855
Give him an oportunity.

16:34.775 --> 16:36.296
How is? It is sweet?

16:39.495 --> 16:40.495
It's pretty good.

16:40.936 --> 16:42.535
You should let me try it then.

16:43.135 --> 16:44.336
There's still a lot.

16:44.495 --> 16:45.576
Put on a bowl.

16:46.615 --> 16:48.895
Did I try your medicine to see
if it was bitter before you?

16:49.015 --> 16:51.895
Don't you think you should let me try
how sweet the soup is?

16:53.176 --> 16:54.096
Let me try it.

17:26.335 --> 17:27.176
Yeah,

17:27.295 --> 17:28.495
come to my room.

17:43.656 --> 17:44.656
- Young Master.
- Yeah.

17:44.720 --> 17:45.815
Young master, you are awake.

17:45.815 --> 17:46.735
Yeah.

17:50.295 --> 17:51.696
I'm not dreaming, am I?

17:53.856 --> 17:55.696
I could actually see you again.

17:57.216 --> 17:58.055
Yeah.

17:58.735 --> 18:00.575
Young Master, we are all happy

18:00.775 --> 18:02.335
that you returned safely.

18:02.936 --> 18:03.936
This is great.

18:04.176 --> 18:04.616
Yeah,

18:04.616 --> 18:05.815
we can be together again.

18:11.936 --> 18:12.535
Padre.

18:14.936 --> 18:15.735
Do not get up.

18:16.616 --> 18:17.880
You have to rest and recover.

18:19.616 --> 18:20.255
Padre,

18:21.335 --> 18:23.136
Cui Li captured Shu as well.

18:24.055 --> 18:25.936
I don't know where he hid it.

18:26.216 --> 18:26.976
I knew it.

18:27.335 --> 18:28.656
He was also rescued.

18:29.976 --> 18:30.976
Thanks, Dad.

18:33.095 --> 18:34.575
You are my son.

18:35.295 --> 18:36.775
Why are you being so polite now?

18:39.295 --> 18:40.176
Maybe...

18:42.696 --> 18:44.335
Maybe it's because
I've survived a disaster.

18:46.176 --> 18:47.456
I'm still stumped.

18:48.535 --> 18:50.535
I still feel like I'm in dreams.

18:58.055 --> 18:59.815
You were born with a weak constitution.

19:00.616 --> 19:02.376
When the doctor reads your pulse,

19:03.335 --> 19:04.656
he said you were healthier

19:04.696 --> 19:06.216
more than before.

19:07.535 --> 19:09.456
Maybe everything got better

19:09.920 --> 19:11.176
after surviving the disaster.

19:14.176 --> 19:14.976
Yeah.

19:17.335 --> 19:18.416
I hope so.

19:32.130 --> 19:34.015
Your Majesty.
Are you trying to kill someone?

19:38.095 --> 19:39.416
I'll go on a killing spree

19:39.535 --> 19:41.255
if you don't come back.

19:41.575 --> 19:43.295
My older brother survived a disaster.

19:43.456 --> 19:44.856
And, finally we rescued him.

19:44.976 --> 19:46.376
Shouldn't I see him?

19:46.775 --> 19:48.376
I do not care

19:48.575 --> 19:50.055
If he were your real big brother.

19:50.176 --> 19:51.535
But it's not like that.

19:52.136 --> 19:54.015
You even made him a set of chess pieces

19:54.015 --> 19:55.216
and your hands hurt.

19:55.856 --> 19:57.495
You always call him Brother.

19:57.616 --> 19:58.136
That?

19:58.136 --> 19:59.216
Don't you have a name?

20:00.815 --> 20:02.936
His real name is Liu Chengfeng.

20:03.055 --> 20:04.376
Although his last name is not Cui,

20:04.495 --> 20:05.456
it's my real

20:05.575 --> 20:06.936
eldest brother.

20:09.295 --> 20:10.575
Either way, I don't like it.

20:11.095 --> 20:12.575
It is disloyal and dishonest.

20:12.590 --> 20:13.735
At that time, he sold Tong Pass outside

20:13.735 --> 20:15.730
and caused the death of
many soldiers in the Zhenxi Army.

20:16.295 --> 20:17.216
Besides,

20:17.815 --> 20:18.456
even

20:18.456 --> 20:19.656
argued with me

20:19.775 --> 20:21.216
because I didn't save him in time.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.735
You never acted
like this in front of me

20:22.740 --> 20:23.670
for the good of other people.

20:24.535 --> 20:25.376
Now that it's back,

20:25.376 --> 20:27.136
you spent so much time
checking it.

20:27.140 --> 20:28.376
Even if it's your real brother,

20:28.376 --> 20:29.410
I think you went to the sea.

20:30.456 --> 20:31.856
You're so petty.

20:32.176 --> 20:34.216
I think I'll tell the kitchen
to send you a vat

20:34.216 --> 20:36.656
of vinegar to cure you of your jealousy tonight.

20:40.216 --> 20:42.575
We were interrupted
when we had dessert.

20:42.936 --> 20:43.575
That?

20:43.920 --> 20:45.110
Do you want me to drink vinegar now?

20:45.255 --> 20:45.896
GOOD.

20:46.095 --> 20:47.616
Drink vinegar with me.

20:47.616 --> 20:49.176
Let's try it together.

20:57.735 --> 20:58.735
We won't have the chance

20:58.735 --> 20:59.950
when Great General Cui is here.

21:20.976 --> 21:22.110
That was an excellent plan.

21:22.335 --> 21:23.815
Cui Li deserves to die.

21:25.416 --> 21:27.616
Many soldiers died because of him.

21:28.896 --> 21:30.535
It also caused Xing's death.

21:32.456 --> 21:34.295
I wanted to kill him a long time ago.

21:35.456 --> 21:36.656
I've kept it alive until now

21:37.575 --> 21:39.456
to be able to use it fully.

21:39.936 --> 21:40.616
young master,

21:41.520 --> 21:42.920
li Ni is in residence.

21:44.765 --> 21:45.723
Actually?

21:47.120 --> 21:48.710
Young Master, you poisoned the lieutenant

21:48.896 --> 21:50.575
to lure Li Ni to the residence.

21:51.055 --> 21:53.055
However, he did not expect that the Great General

21:53.120 --> 21:54.616
to let him take care of Lieutenant Him.

21:59.656 --> 22:00.216
Young master,

22:01.136 --> 22:02.055
is Great General

22:02.735 --> 22:03.456
going to parade

22:03.456 --> 22:04.976
lieutenant He to Li Ni?

22:07.696 --> 22:09.896
Everyone who stops me from marrying Ying

22:11.015 --> 22:12.295
they will have to die.

22:13.856 --> 22:16.055
Since Li Ni is already here,

22:17.416 --> 22:19.376
I'll get rid of him first.

22:25.095 --> 22:25.815
Padre,

22:26.550 --> 22:27.495
were you looking for me?

22:28.295 --> 22:29.136
Feng,

22:29.775 --> 22:30.535
take a sit.

22:33.055 --> 22:33.815
Padre,

22:34.770 --> 22:36.510
Now that you're addressing me
by that name,

22:37.055 --> 22:38.575
I feel like I'm not used to it.

22:39.616 --> 22:43.055
Feng, even since you were seriously injured
and fell into the water,

22:43.616 --> 22:45.136
I sent many of my men

22:45.255 --> 22:46.535
to look for you

22:47.030 --> 22:48.520
We can't find you
no matter what we do.

22:49.616 --> 22:52.335
I thought you were already gone.

22:53.335 --> 22:55.495
After that, Ying and I

22:55.815 --> 22:57.896
Went to pay our respects to you
at your grave.

22:58.616 --> 22:59.896
They reminded me of the past.

23:01.656 --> 23:02.856
In the past,

23:03.656 --> 23:05.335
I was too selfish.

23:06.015 --> 23:07.856
Although I asked you

23:08.120 --> 23:10.410
If you were willing to be my son
when you were young,

23:10.470 --> 23:12.335
you were still young
and callous back then.

23:12.656 --> 23:14.936
You couldn't fully understand
what I told you.

23:16.216 --> 23:16.976
Padre.

23:22.896 --> 23:24.095
I have decided.

23:25.216 --> 23:27.295
You can call yourself
Liu Chengfeng again.

23:28.495 --> 23:30.376
However, you will still be my son.

23:31.575 --> 23:33.255
I will tell everyone

23:33.456 --> 23:34.896
that you are my adopted son.

23:37.575 --> 23:38.416
Padre,

23:40.055 --> 23:42.136
Are you allowing me
to acknowledge my ancestry?

23:44.456 --> 23:45.335
Now,

23:45.575 --> 23:47.015
ying is all grown up.

23:47.735 --> 23:49.136
She was born as a deliberate girl.

23:49.575 --> 23:51.896
She doesn't need me to take care of her.

23:52.456 --> 23:53.456
you grew up

23:53.456 --> 23:54.856
in our residence since he was young.

23:55.015 --> 23:55.856
Really

23:55.856 --> 23:57.495
I saw you as my son.

23:58.656 --> 24:00.335
I want you to recognize your ancestry.

24:01.416 --> 24:02.456
After that,

24:03.015 --> 24:05.136
I will tell the matchmaker

24:05.255 --> 24:07.255
to find a virtuous wife for you

24:07.416 --> 24:08.976
and give birth to your descendants.

24:09.176 --> 24:10.535
In this way, the Liu family

24:10.976 --> 24:12.696
They will be able to maintain their lineage.

24:13.735 --> 24:14.616
Padre,

24:15.216 --> 24:16.856
are you abandoning me?

24:19.936 --> 24:21.856
Although you are changing your name,

24:22.055 --> 24:24.015
You are still my son.

24:32.815 --> 24:33.535
Padre,

24:34.456 --> 24:35.216
gracias.

24:44.535 --> 24:45.176
Padre.

24:45.920 --> 24:46.976
It's time to take your medicine.

24:48.775 --> 24:49.735
Why are you serving me

24:49.735 --> 24:50.936
with my medicine today?

24:51.015 --> 24:51.896
Padre,

24:51.896 --> 24:53.216
serve you

24:53.216 --> 24:54.416
it is my duty.

24:55.095 --> 24:56.335
Padre,

24:56.495 --> 24:58.376
I'm sure you were worried about me

24:58.390 --> 25:00.410
when I fell into the water
after suffering serious injuries.

25:01.255 --> 25:02.976
Even so, you still thought of me

25:03.130 --> 25:04.810
and allowed me
to recognize my ancestry.

25:05.295 --> 25:07.015
I am really grateful to you.

25:07.735 --> 25:09.416
Although I am not your real son,

25:10.335 --> 25:11.696
in my heart,

25:13.416 --> 25:14.176
padre,

25:15.216 --> 25:17.376
You will always be my real father.

25:18.575 --> 25:20.015
So these are the obligations

25:20.376 --> 25:21.735
should comply.

25:22.295 --> 25:23.216
In the future,

25:23.335 --> 25:25.976
I will serve you well.

25:26.980 --> 25:28.510
You just recovered from your condition.

25:28.520 --> 25:29.976
And, you just came back not long ago.

25:30.136 --> 25:31.570
You also have to rest and recover.

25:32.095 --> 25:33.495
I will tell Taozi to read your pulse

25:33.656 --> 25:36.335
and prepare some recipes
for you after this.

25:38.255 --> 25:39.216
Thanks, Dad.

25:44.416 --> 25:45.015
Here.

25:45.416 --> 25:46.535
Father, please take your medicine.

25:50.055 --> 25:50.976
Be careful. It's hot.

26:11.295 --> 26:12.015
Greetings,

26:12.416 --> 26:13.495
great General.

26:13.815 --> 26:15.575
Mr. Qin, what do you need?

26:16.136 --> 26:16.815
Great General,

26:17.255 --> 26:18.176
I want to discuss

26:18.176 --> 26:19.495
the Changzhou issue with you.

26:20.095 --> 26:21.095
Changzhou

26:21.095 --> 26:22.815
It is already part of our territory.

26:23.856 --> 26:25.815
Lord Qin, if you want
to retake Changzhou,

26:26.015 --> 26:27.976
We will see each other on the battlefield.

26:28.176 --> 26:29.656
Great General, you misunderstood me.

26:29.670 --> 26:31.370
Initially, I wrote a letter
to the Cui army

26:31.376 --> 26:34.216
to request your help
in resolving the emergency in Changzhou.

26:34.596 --> 26:36.535
Great General, you have stationed
your troops in Changzhou.

26:36.775 --> 26:38.255
Although I came here with my army,

26:38.696 --> 26:39.335
I wouldn't want

26:39.896 --> 26:41.976
get involved in a battle.

26:47.775 --> 26:49.015
Is that so?

27:01.136 --> 27:01.856
Great General?

27:02.616 --> 27:03.456
Great General?

27:03.976 --> 27:04.775
Great General!

27:04.936 --> 27:05.815
Great General!

27:23.255 --> 27:24.575
Don't let it escape!

27:24.815 --> 27:26.295
He hurt the Great General!

27:26.616 --> 27:27.176
¡Dinos!

27:27.295 --> 27:28.656
What exactly did you do

27:28.656 --> 27:29.775
to the Great General?

27:29.896 --> 27:30.936
I already told you.

27:31.095 --> 27:32.575
I talked to him

27:32.575 --> 27:34.330
when he vomited blood
and fell unconscious.

27:34.616 --> 27:36.255
That's why I went out to look for help.

27:36.976 --> 27:38.216
Why would I seek help?

27:38.735 --> 27:40.295
If I intend to hurt him?

27:47.055 --> 27:48.815
You did not go

27:49.270 --> 27:50.976
because you know
you couldn't escape.

27:52.416 --> 27:53.575
Bring the archers here.

27:54.136 --> 27:55.255
Don't let him escape.

27:56.055 --> 27:58.015
kill him

27:58.700 --> 27:59.976
if something happens to the Father.

28:06.815 --> 28:07.856
Great General!

28:09.295 --> 28:10.216
Great General!

28:13.775 --> 28:14.815
Taozi, how are you?

28:18.376 --> 28:19.335
Great General?

28:21.495 --> 28:22.376
Great General.

28:22.575 --> 28:23.376
Great General!

28:26.696 --> 28:27.616
Great General!

28:49.735 --> 28:50.656
kill him

28:50.815 --> 28:52.255
avenge Father!

28:52.775 --> 28:53.495
Wait!

28:58.030 --> 29:00.160
The truth behind the Great General's
murder has not yet been revealed.

29:00.176 --> 29:02.110
We cannot confirm if he was poisoned
or damaged by other methods.

29:02.216 --> 29:03.696
You shouldn't kill him.

29:03.696 --> 29:05.616
Even now, are you still
trying to defend him?

29:05.616 --> 29:06.696
I'm not defending him.

29:06.856 --> 29:08.656
My father is barely breathing now.

29:09.495 --> 29:11.136
You must have been under a spell.

29:11.255 --> 29:13.015
Lord Qin will never harm the Great General!

29:13.176 --> 29:14.295
For the sake of Changzhou,

29:14.535 --> 29:15.255
Mr. Qin

29:15.255 --> 29:16.416
will resort to anything.

29:17.255 --> 29:18.936
He is cunning and dishonest.

29:19.095 --> 29:20.376
If we don't kill him,

29:20.535 --> 29:21.696
will escape!

29:31.015 --> 29:31.976
¡Fuego!

29:31.976 --> 29:32.656
¡Deja!

29:33.095 --> 29:33.976
Release him!

29:39.216 --> 29:40.216
Let go!

29:42.055 --> 29:43.535
How dare you treat me like this?

29:44.335 --> 29:45.176
Lieutenant,

29:45.230 --> 29:46.710
are you trying to organize a revolt here?

29:54.216 --> 29:55.055
Let go.

30:00.696 --> 30:02.055
Let go!

30:23.456 --> 30:24.696
He's gone.

30:26.255 --> 30:27.535
With its capacity,

30:28.620 --> 30:30.710
I probably won't be able
to reach it.

30:33.416 --> 30:35.656
So, are you still going
to put your sword to my neck?

30:46.896 --> 30:47.896
Someone!

30:50.856 --> 30:52.535
Lieutenant was tricked by the villain.

30:53.616 --> 30:54.896
And he released the suspect.

30:55.936 --> 30:56.936
Send it...

30:59.656 --> 31:01.295
Send her to the water prison.

31:01.456 --> 31:02.535
Young Master!

31:02.656 --> 31:04.095
The life of the Great General is in danger.

31:04.095 --> 31:05.015
You must postpone

31:05.015 --> 31:06.095
my punishment for now.

31:06.255 --> 31:08.095
Let me first look
after the Great General.

31:08.616 --> 31:11.136
So, they still knew that
Great General's life was in danger?

31:13.295 --> 31:14.255
¡Sácala!

31:14.896 --> 31:15.616
Take her.

31:22.936 --> 31:23.656
Young master,

31:23.720 --> 31:25.136
I believe the Great General was poisoned.

31:25.335 --> 31:26.176
Lieutenant He, she...

31:26.815 --> 31:28.255
I was anxious.

31:28.416 --> 31:29.575
Why don't you let him stay?

31:29.775 --> 31:30.656
Be quiet!

31:31.670 --> 31:32.216
Young Master.

31:32.216 --> 31:32.856
Someone!

31:34.335 --> 31:35.015
Young Master!

31:35.176 --> 31:37.055
Arrest Taozi too.

31:38.055 --> 31:39.810
His punishment
will be announced in due time.

31:39.896 --> 31:40.616
Young Master!

31:41.136 --> 31:42.136
Young Master!

31:44.136 --> 31:45.136
Young Master!

31:58.295 --> 31:59.015
How can you...

32:00.230 --> 32:01.095
Where is Mr. Shiqi?

32:01.295 --> 32:02.376
He has already escaped.

32:03.015 --> 32:04.015
Where is the lieutenant?

32:04.070 --> 32:06.535
She is under close surveillance.
We can't rescue her for now.

32:06.535 --> 32:07.280
We will flee first.

32:07.376 --> 32:07.976
Let's go.

32:19.856 --> 32:21.820
Young master,
we have brought Lieutenant He here.

32:22.856 --> 32:23.970
- Yes, Young Master.
- Yes, Young Master.

32:30.416 --> 32:31.055
Yeah,

32:32.896 --> 32:33.936
you must have suffered.

32:35.216 --> 32:36.095
But today,

32:36.775 --> 32:38.136
you put your sword on my neck

32:38.575 --> 32:39.856
in public.

32:40.216 --> 32:41.376
It does not matter that,

32:41.616 --> 32:43.495
I had to punish you.

32:43.510 --> 32:45.270
Young master, you can stop
making excuses.

32:45.856 --> 32:47.456
He had a sudden change of attitude.

32:48.460 --> 32:50.976
I guess you want to take this opportunity
to get rid of Li Ni.

32:52.495 --> 32:53.335
Yeah,

32:54.656 --> 32:56.696
Why do you trust Li Ni so much?

32:57.936 --> 33:00.055
He harmed the Father to take Changzhou again.

33:00.535 --> 33:03.136
The truth is right in front of you.

33:03.140 --> 33:04.575
Why don't you want
to be willing to face the truth?

33:04.575 --> 33:06.055
TRUE? What is the truth?

33:06.176 --> 33:07.856
Why does Li Ni want to harm Father?

33:07.856 --> 33:09.575
In order to retake Changzhou!

33:11.856 --> 33:12.976
I have already ordered my men

33:13.416 --> 33:15.456
to investigate every detail.

33:16.255 --> 33:17.495
But now, Li Ni is

33:17.495 --> 33:18.535
the biggest suspect.

33:18.830 --> 33:21.176
You can't let him go
because you want to defend him.

33:29.136 --> 33:29.856
Yeah,

33:32.095 --> 33:33.255
let's drop the topic,

33:33.255 --> 33:34.015
Alright?

33:35.495 --> 33:37.055
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

33:38.070 --> 33:40.015
I have ordered my men
to prepare your favorite dishes.

33:40.950 --> 33:42.015
You should have something.

33:44.936 --> 33:46.136
I want to visit Father.

33:48.136 --> 33:48.815
Yeah,

33:50.936 --> 33:52.216
finish your meal,

33:53.015 --> 33:54.216
and I will take you there.

33:55.856 --> 33:57.456
You are so worried about Father

33:57.575 --> 33:59.015
that you can't sleep

33:59.095 --> 34:00.335
or eat.

34:01.295 --> 34:03.176
Father will be worried too

34:03.936 --> 34:05.656
if he sees you in this state, right?

34:18.655 --> 34:19.296
Young teacher.

34:19.575 --> 34:20.736
You guys can go first.

34:21.655 --> 34:23.416
Young master, what about
Lieutenant He...

34:23.615 --> 34:24.376
Alright.

34:25.430 --> 34:27.110
Lieutenant She was
deceived and bewitched.

34:27.736 --> 34:29.095
She has reflected on her actions.

34:29.630 --> 34:30.655
She knows her guilt now.

34:31.655 --> 34:32.296
You can go.

34:33.416 --> 34:34.256
- Yes
Yes.

34:50.816 --> 34:51.695
Padre,

34:53.695 --> 34:55.736
I will definitely find the culprit

34:57.055 --> 34:58.896
behind this incident

35:00.416 --> 35:01.456
and get revenge.

35:07.336 --> 35:08.896
Let me stay here and take care of Father.

35:09.015 --> 35:09.655
No.

35:15.256 --> 35:16.015
Yeah,

35:18.296 --> 35:19.695
we are all upset

35:21.936 --> 35:23.655
that Father ended like this.

35:24.376 --> 35:25.736
We are on high alert as well.

35:27.695 --> 35:30.135
I fear that someone is still trying
to harm Father.

35:31.816 --> 35:33.055
That's why we came

35:33.055 --> 35:34.456
with a shift schedule.

35:37.416 --> 35:38.055
Yeah,

35:38.896 --> 35:39.936
go back to your room

35:41.095 --> 35:42.296
and sleep.

35:43.535 --> 35:44.630
I will bring you to see Father

35:45.856 --> 35:47.615
tomorrow morning.

35:49.175 --> 35:50.495
Will you have your words?

35:50.615 --> 35:52.376
Clear.

36:13.776 --> 36:14.495
In my opinion,

36:14.495 --> 36:16.055
Why don't we load in Changzhou?

36:16.055 --> 36:17.416
We can kidnap Great General Cui first.

36:17.416 --> 36:18.456
After that, we can treat it.

36:18.456 --> 36:21.776
I will tell them that you were not the one
who harmed Great General Cui.

36:21.776 --> 36:22.936
Are you stupid?

36:22.936 --> 36:24.175
Yes we did it,

36:24.175 --> 36:25.655
we have to attack Changzhou first.

36:25.655 --> 36:26.535
If we do it,

36:26.535 --> 36:28.470
Mr. Shiqi will never be able
to explain himself.

36:28.535 --> 36:29.776
By then, the Cui Army

36:29.776 --> 36:31.615
He will definitely see us as sworn enemies.

36:33.416 --> 36:34.015
Señor Shiqi.

36:35.055 --> 36:35.736
Taozi.

36:35.950 --> 36:36.896
What are you doing here?

36:36.920 --> 36:37.816
Where is your lieutenant?

36:37.816 --> 36:38.495
How are you doing?

36:38.816 --> 36:40.055
Lieutenant is arrested.

36:40.070 --> 36:41.560
The young master keeps her under
heavy surveillance.

36:41.575 --> 36:43.095
I even wanted to lock myself up.

36:43.215 --> 36:44.816
I thought I should escape

36:44.816 --> 36:45.936
and come here with your ear.

36:46.055 --> 36:47.456
I should regroup with you

36:47.456 --> 36:49.360
and see if there is a way for you
to discover the truth.

36:49.376 --> 36:51.055
Who exactly injured Great General Cui?

36:51.220 --> 36:52.495
Did he have internal injuries?

36:52.615 --> 36:53.655
Or was he poisoned?

36:53.936 --> 36:55.416
It is likely that he was poisoned.

36:55.655 --> 36:56.615
What kind of poison?

36:56.936 --> 36:58.055
I read his pulse quickly.

36:58.175 --> 37:01.055
The young master sent his men to arrest me.
Before he could figure it out.

37:09.695 --> 37:10.416
Ying,

37:11.120 --> 37:12.816
my father had a conversation conversation
with me

37:13.256 --> 37:14.615
before he fell unconscious.

37:15.495 --> 37:17.175
It allowed me to recognize my ancestry

37:17.736 --> 37:19.535
and changed my name
back to Liu Chengfeng.

37:20.336 --> 37:21.336
Also he said

37:21.695 --> 37:23.296
that he was still his son.

37:24.175 --> 37:25.896
Has Father told you?

37:29.856 --> 37:30.856
At first, father thought

37:31.416 --> 37:32.936
you were dead

37:33.655 --> 37:35.015
I was heartbroken.

37:36.575 --> 37:38.015
He told me before.

37:38.856 --> 37:40.535
He thought I was going to disappoint you

37:41.095 --> 37:42.055
allow you

37:42.055 --> 37:43.376
bear the name Cui Lin

37:44.135 --> 37:45.215
All these years.

37:45.776 --> 37:47.055
Lament

37:47.520 --> 37:49.350
that didn't allow you
to be your true self.

37:52.376 --> 37:54.215
Father also mentioned one thing.

37:55.256 --> 37:56.535
My father said

37:57.095 --> 37:58.416
would you let me marry you

37:58.416 --> 37:59.695
after changing my name again

38:01.896 --> 38:03.135
a Liu Chengfeng.

38:05.615 --> 38:06.736
My father even said

38:07.890 --> 38:08.695
that our first child

38:08.695 --> 38:10.135
could take the surname Liu

38:10.336 --> 38:12.655
while the other children could take

38:13.015 --> 38:14.936
the surname Cui.

38:15.256 --> 38:17.495
In this way, both the
Cui and Liu family lineage

38:17.615 --> 38:18.976
will be preserved.

38:20.015 --> 38:20.776
Yeah,

38:21.376 --> 38:22.495
father had everything

38:22.495 --> 38:23.575
thought for us.

38:24.215 --> 38:25.215
It is a shame

38:25.416 --> 38:26.175
que Li Ni

38:26.175 --> 38:27.736
hurt him

38:28.095 --> 38:29.776
before I could do it.

38:33.575 --> 38:34.416
Young master,

38:36.336 --> 38:38.175
Are you sure Father said that?

38:38.296 --> 38:39.055
Clear.

38:49.535 --> 38:50.256
Yeah,

38:52.336 --> 38:54.296
let's get married.

38:55.336 --> 38:57.015
This way, you will be my wife.

38:57.896 --> 38:59.776
And no one will dare

39:00.535 --> 39:01.816
mention the incident

39:01.816 --> 39:03.510
where you put your sword
to my neck again.

39:04.736 --> 39:05.615
Once

39:05.615 --> 39:06.736
get marry,

39:07.215 --> 39:09.936
you can take care of Father properly.

39:10.976 --> 39:12.655
Father is unconscious

39:12.816 --> 39:14.055
and his life is in danger.

39:16.376 --> 39:18.095
Now, do you really want
to celebrate a wedding?

39:18.615 --> 39:20.095
What if Father regains consciousness?

39:20.336 --> 39:21.575
of happiness?

39:23.816 --> 39:25.296
It was the Father's disposition.

39:26.695 --> 39:27.495
Yeah,

39:29.495 --> 39:30.615
are you not willing to do it?

39:30.615 --> 39:31.695
No, I'm not willing.

39:32.896 --> 39:33.776
My father will not do such

39:33.776 --> 39:34.856
a fix.

39:35.776 --> 39:37.015
If you do not believe me,

39:38.215 --> 39:39.896
You can wait until father wakes up.

39:40.820 --> 39:42.215
You can ask him personally by then.

39:42.215 --> 39:43.256
I already told you.

39:43.695 --> 39:44.695
The father never

39:44.695 --> 39:45.736
make such an arrangement!

39:46.336 --> 39:47.256
I guess you've been

39:47.256 --> 39:48.856
too worried about Father's health

39:49.055 --> 39:50.655
that you are getting confused.

39:51.376 --> 39:52.376
Don't worry.

39:53.015 --> 39:54.256
I will make arrangements

39:54.456 --> 39:56.095
for our wedding.

39:57.456 --> 39:58.896
The only thing you have to do now

39:59.376 --> 40:01.336
is to become my girlfriend.

40:14.336 --> 40:16.215
Keep an eye on the lieutenant.

40:16.776 --> 40:19.015
Don't let her
leave the room.

40:19.456 --> 40:20.936
Bring the archers here.

40:21.695 --> 40:23.736
Maintain strict security.

40:25.296 --> 40:26.615
I don't even want

40:26.615 --> 40:27.976
see a fly here.

40:28.456 --> 40:29.256
- Yes
Yes.

40:42.055 --> 40:43.296
Councilor Wang is here.

40:43.296 --> 40:44.336
Congratulations.

40:53.256 --> 40:54.695
Bride,

40:54.896 --> 40:56.816
The auspicious hour is approaching.

40:56.816 --> 40:59.055
you have to dress

40:59.055 --> 41:00.095
Where is Liu Chengfeng?

41:00.695 --> 41:01.655
Tell him to come here.

41:02.695 --> 41:03.736
Bride,

41:04.215 --> 41:05.816
today is your wedding.

41:05.920 --> 41:08.015
You are going to marry
Young Master Cui soon.

41:08.015 --> 41:09.776
You have no idea how lucky you are.

41:09.776 --> 41:11.015
Bring Young Master Cui here.

41:11.015 --> 41:12.175
I need to talk to him.

41:12.535 --> 41:13.095
But,

41:13.416 --> 41:16.296
I won't let this wedding continue.

41:16.575 --> 41:17.575
But...

41:17.575 --> 41:18.575
Bring him here!

41:21.296 --> 41:22.135
Yeah.

41:29.695 --> 41:32.256
Congratulations.

41:32.290 --> 41:33.649
(Residence of the prefectural governor)

41:36.015 --> 41:37.336
Congratulations.

42:03.856 --> 42:04.615
Ying,

42:05.456 --> 42:07.296
Why haven't you dressed yet?

42:08.256 --> 42:09.449
It will be horrible

42:09.450 --> 42:10.936
if we miss the auspicious hour.

42:13.336 --> 42:14.175
It was you.

42:18.336 --> 42:19.695
It was you, right?

42:22.215 --> 42:24.376
What kind of poison
have you fed Father?

42:27.736 --> 42:28.416
Look to you.

42:29.190 --> 42:30.736
Have you forgotten all the joy?

42:31.336 --> 42:33.416
Why are you spewing nonsense?

42:36.120 --> 42:38.215
I was almost killed in Changzhou
not long ago.

42:38.936 --> 42:40.776
Someone imitated you to attract me.

42:41.095 --> 42:42.175
However, he only kidnapped me

42:42.175 --> 42:43.495
without harming me.

42:43.655 --> 42:45.296
I thought something was wrong back then.

42:46.095 --> 42:47.095
Was you

42:47.095 --> 42:48.376
who lured me out, right?

42:48.816 --> 42:50.870
It was you
who sent the assassin too, right?

42:51.215 --> 42:51.976
Ying,

42:52.976 --> 42:54.695
stop spilling nonsense.

42:57.055 --> 42:58.695
I've been waiting for this day

43:00.095 --> 43:02.095
since I was a teenager.

43:03.736 --> 43:05.655
Today is our wedding.

43:06.495 --> 43:07.575
You will

43:07.575 --> 43:08.856
my girlfriend soon

43:10.296 --> 43:11.896
Once we get married,

43:12.376 --> 43:14.135
I will definitely treat you well.

43:14.655 --> 43:16.495
I will also kill Li Ni

43:17.135 --> 43:18.655
to avenge Father.

43:21.695 --> 43:23.256
Revenge Father, huh?

43:24.695 --> 43:25.936
Liu Chengfeng,

43:26.470 --> 43:29.470
You may be able to fool others,
but you won't be able to fool me!

43:36.256 --> 43:37.416
It was you who

43:37.416 --> 43:38.695
who poisoned the father, right?

43:39.976 --> 43:41.416
Your father always treated you

43:41.416 --> 43:42.936
like his own son.

43:43.736 --> 43:44.976
Since young,

43:45.896 --> 43:47.736
I always treated you
like my older brother.

43:49.456 --> 43:50.936
How cruel are you

43:50.936 --> 43:52.976
why do you do something like this?

43:56.055 --> 43:56.816
Yeah,

43:58.655 --> 43:59.416
mira.

44:00.615 --> 44:02.856
I made this pin for you.

44:03.615 --> 44:05.456
Today, I finally have the chance

44:06.215 --> 44:07.776
give it to him

44:07.776 --> 44:08.816
as my symbol of love.

44:09.856 --> 44:10.776
Carry it.

44:14.936 --> 44:15.695
Yeah,

44:17.495 --> 44:19.256
It's better that you don't go.

44:20.215 --> 44:21.896
You could get hurt.

44:23.055 --> 44:24.456
What if Father finds out?

44:24.575 --> 44:25.816
that you are hurt?

44:29.336 --> 44:30.135
What if

44:30.135 --> 44:31.535
Is there something wrong with you?

44:31.695 --> 44:33.856
How dare you blackmail me
with Father's life?

44:34.495 --> 44:36.655
Father will be happy

44:37.336 --> 44:38.736
as long as you marry me.

44:41.135 --> 44:43.095
What if something bad happens to Father

44:46.376 --> 44:48.296
Why is he worried about you?

44:48.296 --> 44:49.416
Write immediately!

44:59.015 --> 44:59.695
Yeah,

45:01.456 --> 45:03.055
you should take a break.

45:05.856 --> 45:07.736
I need to invite father

45:08.896 --> 45:11.416
to witness our wedding too.

45:17.535 --> 45:18.535
How dare you?

45:19.215 --> 45:21.135
Touch Father if you dare!

45:27.776 --> 45:28.655
Yeah,

45:29.575 --> 45:31.816
father will be fine

45:33.095 --> 45:35.215
as long as you marry me.

45:36.976 --> 45:37.816
Someone.

45:41.336 --> 45:42.376
Yes, Young Master.

45:43.416 --> 45:45.456
Bring the lieutenant.

45:46.736 --> 45:48.055
Bring her to the wedding hall

45:48.816 --> 45:50.495
once the auspicious hour has arrived.

45:51.135 --> 45:51.896
Yes, Young Master.

46:14.770 --> 46:16.535
- Congratulations, Young Master.
- Congratulations, Young Master.

46:16.555 --> 46:17.508
(Which)

46:17.535 --> 46:19.575
We have to drink until we drop today.

46:19.620 --> 46:22.110
It is a shame that the Great General
has not recovered from his condition.

46:22.135 --> 46:23.736
If not, we will have twice as much happiness.

46:46.376 --> 46:47.215
Padre,

46:49.015 --> 46:51.456
Today is my wedding with Ying.

46:53.976 --> 46:55.976
Look at all the guests we have here.

46:56.535 --> 46:58.135
They are all here to congratulate us.

47:00.816 --> 47:01.575
Padre,

47:02.896 --> 47:04.296
although you are still sick,

47:04.535 --> 47:06.416
I still love you

47:06.416 --> 47:08.575
to witness our wedding.

47:17.256 --> 47:18.215
Padre,

47:19.736 --> 47:21.296
I have been your son

47:22.256 --> 47:23.495
for more than 20 years.

47:26.456 --> 47:28.416
You have never accepted

47:29.535 --> 47:31.015
let me marry Ying.

47:32.695 --> 47:34.376
That's why I can only

47:35.575 --> 47:37.175
depend on myself

47:38.456 --> 47:40.336
to fulfill my own wish.

47:42.695 --> 47:43.495
Padre,

47:45.376 --> 47:46.976
I brought you out

47:47.816 --> 47:50.376
to show you

47:52.776 --> 47:56.336
that both the Cui army

47:58.336 --> 48:00.736
and your precious daughter is mine.

48:03.976 --> 48:05.055
Padre,

48:05.816 --> 48:07.416
hereinafter,

48:09.055 --> 48:10.376
I will inherit

48:10.376 --> 48:11.896
the empire you built.

48:12.376 --> 48:13.776
I will also ensure

48:13.776 --> 48:15.535
your precious daughter.

48:19.495 --> 48:20.416
Shu.

48:43.135 --> 48:43.896
Lieutenant.

48:58.655 --> 48:59.135
Padre,

49:00.655 --> 49:03.135
I'm going to propose a toast to you.

49:04.456 --> 49:05.495
After that,

49:06.896 --> 49:11.296
I will marry Ying.

49:13.196 --> 49:13.695
