01:44.089 --> 01:46.190
(Han Residence)

01:57.630 --> 01:59.400
Sorry for keeping you wait.

02:00.350 --> 02:01.270
Greetings, Lord Han.

02:03.570 --> 02:04.830
I'm the envoy of Grand Governor.

02:04.990 --> 02:06.320
How dare you stop me?

02:12.839 --> 02:14.190
(Which)

02:15.480 --> 02:17.620
Do you know
that befriending Cui Yi privately

02:17.680 --> 02:19.960
without informing Grand Governor
is a crime?

02:26.200 --> 02:27.710
Please don't be mad.

02:28.150 --> 02:31.520
I was planning to invite you here

02:31.750 --> 02:32.870
to discuss together.

02:32.870 --> 02:35.960
I didn't expect you to arrive so quickly.

02:36.960 --> 02:38.590
You're from Cui Army?

02:39.400 --> 02:41.640
Why did General Cui send you here?

02:43.990 --> 02:44.640
Lord Han.

02:46.120 --> 02:47.430
Lieutenant He from Cui Army

02:47.430 --> 02:48.640
is in your residence.

02:48.920 --> 02:51.710
Please ask her out to meet me.

02:54.430 --> 02:56.750
Lieutenant He from Cui Army

02:56.960 --> 02:58.640
is in my residence?

03:00.640 --> 03:01.750
There's no such thing.

03:01.960 --> 03:04.590
Cui Army is right outside of Bingzhou.

03:04.960 --> 03:06.990
If you insist on not releasing her,

03:07.270 --> 03:09.710
don't blame us
for entering the city to look for her.

03:10.360 --> 03:11.150
Lord Han.

03:11.750 --> 03:13.310
This is your fault.

03:14.400 --> 03:15.920
Zhenxi Rebel is right at our doorstep.

03:16.240 --> 03:18.360
Not only you're
not working with Cui Army,

03:18.750 --> 03:19.430
you're detaining

03:19.590 --> 03:20.800
someone from Cui Army.

03:21.590 --> 03:23.360
You're oppressing our ally.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.920
I must report it to Grand Governor.

03:26.750 --> 03:28.400
Listen to yourself.

03:29.200 --> 03:29.960
Nothing as such

03:30.120 --> 03:31.150
happened here.

03:31.430 --> 03:32.240
We haven't even seen

03:32.360 --> 03:34.430
Lieutenant He you mentioned.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.080
You can fool Cui Army,

03:38.430 --> 03:39.920
but you can't fool me.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.220
The guest room
in the backyard is heavily guarded.

03:42.550 --> 03:44.750
Even Golden Guards
aren't allowed to get close.

03:45.430 --> 03:46.590
People from Cui Army

03:47.120 --> 03:48.480
must have been imprisoned there.

03:49.960 --> 03:50.480
Let's go.

03:51.120 --> 03:52.680
I'll take you to see Lieutenant He.

03:53.430 --> 03:54.520
Thank you.

03:57.830 --> 03:58.710
No need.

04:01.030 --> 04:01.640
I'll ask

04:02.080 --> 04:03.990
Young Master Cui
and Lieutenant He out.

04:33.870 --> 04:34.310
Let's go.

04:45.990 --> 04:46.800
Young Master.

04:48.750 --> 04:49.190
How are you?

04:49.510 --> 04:50.190
Can you hold on?

04:52.990 --> 04:53.600
Young Master.

04:54.680 --> 04:55.990
Why are you doing this?

04:56.240 --> 04:58.190
We only want to invite you to a banquet.

04:58.430 --> 04:59.800
If you see our guest,

04:59.920 --> 05:01.160
you'll surely be happy.

05:07.620 --> 05:08.140
Lead the way.

05:32.240 --> 05:34.190
Master, Young Master Cui is here.

05:52.430 --> 05:55.870
You really do
pamper the beauty, Young Master.

06:03.190 --> 06:05.480
It's a feast today.

06:06.390 --> 06:08.360
I'm so fortunate.

06:09.070 --> 06:09.920
Young Master Cui,

06:10.600 --> 06:12.950
this is the envoy

06:13.040 --> 06:14.720
sent by Grand Governor.

06:17.360 --> 06:19.390
I've long heard
that Young Master Cui is charming.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.600
Now that I see you,

06:20.840 --> 06:22.160
your reputation is well-deserved.

06:27.840 --> 06:28.920
Greetings, Young Master.

06:29.420 --> 06:30.990
Over ten thousand people
from Cui Army

06:31.070 --> 06:32.190
are standing by outside Bingzhou,

06:32.480 --> 06:33.920
waiting for your command.

06:35.360 --> 06:37.410
Lord Han is detaining me
and not letting me leave.

06:37.950 --> 06:38.550
Here.

06:39.280 --> 06:40.600
Tell the leader

06:41.510 --> 06:43.070
that they can march in,

06:43.920 --> 06:45.160
so everyone knows

06:45.600 --> 06:46.920
how great Cui Army is.

06:49.390 --> 06:51.070
You've misunderstood, Young Master Cui.

06:52.070 --> 06:54.040
Outside of the city is crude.

06:54.160 --> 06:55.070
It's not

06:55.240 --> 06:57.550
as comfortable as my mansion.

06:58.190 --> 06:59.480
I just wanted to

06:59.600 --> 07:01.720
make you stay

07:01.800 --> 07:03.240
for a few days more.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.120
Don't worry, Young Master Cui.

07:06.280 --> 07:07.480
If Grand Governor knows

07:07.600 --> 07:09.310
that you're a guest in Bingzhou,

07:09.680 --> 07:10.800
he'll surely have Lord Han

07:10.920 --> 07:13.160
send people
to escort you into the capital.

07:13.630 --> 07:16.310
Xichang is a prosperous place.

07:16.630 --> 07:19.510
You'll like it so much
that you don't want to leave.

07:19.510 --> 07:19.940
Still hurt?

07:30.070 --> 07:32.510
I'm inviting you to the capital
on behalf of Grand Governor.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.600
You're so impolite.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.410
Are you looking down
upon our Grand Governor?

07:36.480 --> 07:37.360
Calm down.

07:37.600 --> 07:38.630
Calm down.

07:39.040 --> 07:40.600
Young Master Cui cares for the beauty.

07:40.720 --> 07:42.480
It's the temperament of a young man.

07:42.990 --> 07:45.310
I'm the envoy of Grand Governor,

07:45.320 --> 07:47.390
equivalent to Grand Governor
on an inspection tour.

07:47.870 --> 07:49.160
You're so arrogant.

07:49.550 --> 07:50.800
You want to rebel?

08:03.550 --> 08:04.950
Don't be angry.

08:05.430 --> 08:06.870
You have no idea.

08:07.630 --> 08:09.040
Lady He

08:09.120 --> 08:11.600
is the lover of Young Master Cui.

08:12.360 --> 08:13.800
In that case,

08:13.920 --> 08:16.360
let's have Lady He
perform a dance in the capital

08:16.870 --> 08:18.430
to celebrate Grand Governor's birthday.

08:18.990 --> 08:20.390
What do you mean by that?

08:20.920 --> 08:22.480
Are you insulting Cui Army?

08:22.630 --> 08:23.510
Her foot is injured.

08:23.750 --> 08:24.430
She can't dance.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.990
Why don't I perform a sword dance

08:35.480 --> 08:36.480
for Grand Governor

08:36.720 --> 08:38.080
in her place?

08:38.630 --> 08:39.750
Great idea.

08:41.200 --> 08:42.360
I didn't expect

08:42.510 --> 08:44.270
to be so fortunate today.

08:45.150 --> 08:45.870
Listen up.

08:46.440 --> 08:47.270
Prepare a sword.

08:47.390 --> 08:47.960
No need.

08:50.120 --> 08:51.910
I shall borrow your sword.

08:53.120 --> 08:54.630
You have no idea.

08:54.720 --> 08:56.390
My sword

08:56.510 --> 08:58.240
is a gentleman's sword.

08:58.510 --> 09:00.240
It has never been used.

09:01.030 --> 09:01.720
It's okay.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.320
I'm just using it for a performance,

09:04.790 --> 09:05.720
not for killing.

09:08.670 --> 09:12.270
You're humorous.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.270
Young Master is performing in my place.

09:22.560 --> 09:23.870
I shall play the zither and sing

09:24.120 --> 09:25.320
as accompaniment.

09:26.510 --> 09:28.750
The beauty does live up to

09:28.960 --> 09:30.600
the kindness of Young Master Cui.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.630
Young Master Cui, here you go.

13:02.670 --> 13:05.670
Charge!

13:12.390 --> 13:13.270
Returning this to you.

13:14.150 --> 13:16.630
Your sword dance

13:17.270 --> 13:20.630
is performed to one's heart content.

13:20.750 --> 13:22.960
How breathtaking.

13:23.560 --> 13:24.750
You've been very hospitable.

13:24.960 --> 13:26.670
I'm glad to help you

13:26.790 --> 13:28.390
solve your problem.

13:32.080 --> 13:33.870
The envoy of Grand Governor

13:33.990 --> 13:35.630
found out that you're here.

13:35.720 --> 13:36.960
He insists to see you.

13:37.120 --> 13:37.600
Young Master.

13:37.750 --> 13:38.240
If this time

13:38.360 --> 13:39.960
you fall into the hands
of Grand Governor,

13:40.270 --> 13:41.990
I'm afraid it'll
be hard for you to escape.

13:42.480 --> 13:44.480
I only hope that
your army outside of the city

13:44.630 --> 13:47.840
can scare the envoy.

13:48.480 --> 13:50.030
I understand Lord Han's good intention.

13:50.750 --> 13:51.480
But your master

13:51.630 --> 13:52.600
is very cunning.

13:53.030 --> 13:54.320
He's unwilling to take action,

13:54.840 --> 13:56.320
and instead
he passes this problem to us.

13:56.910 --> 13:58.480
You're kidding.

13:59.030 --> 14:00.840
After I kill Sun Jing's envoy,

14:01.270 --> 14:02.390
will you just let us go?

14:04.560 --> 14:07.270
If I made a false promise
on behalf of Lord Han,

14:08.150 --> 14:09.840
I would be deceiving you.

14:12.840 --> 14:15.870
But if you kill the envoy,

14:16.240 --> 14:18.080
Lady He can go back.

14:18.960 --> 14:20.360
As for you,

14:20.910 --> 14:23.150
please stay for a few more days.

14:23.480 --> 14:24.390
After Cui Army

14:24.510 --> 14:25.960
retreats for 60 miles,

14:26.240 --> 14:29.670
you shall be allowed to return.

14:36.240 --> 14:36.750
Lord Han.

14:37.520 --> 14:39.700
Although the banquet is nice,
there'll still be an end.

14:39.960 --> 14:41.480
Should you stick to your promise

14:41.670 --> 14:42.270
and let her go?

14:42.270 --> 14:44.390
Of course.

14:46.670 --> 14:47.440
Be sure

14:47.790 --> 14:49.840
to have a physician
look at your wound closely.

14:50.120 --> 14:51.190
Don't leave a chronic pain.

14:55.390 --> 14:56.560
Let's go. I'll see you off.

15:06.440 --> 15:08.080
Here, be careful.

15:20.360 --> 15:21.030
For your luck.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.750
Look at my awesome head.

15:32.240 --> 15:33.560
If it's gone,

15:34.120 --> 15:34.480
I wonder

15:34.600 --> 15:35.630
if anyone will cry for me.

15:38.360 --> 15:39.560
I won't.

15:58.720 --> 16:01.030
Charge!

16:18.670 --> 16:19.240
Ying.

16:19.920 --> 16:20.380
Young Master.

16:20.390 --> 16:22.110
- What's wrong with your foot?
- It's fine.

16:22.320 --> 16:23.440
It's just a minor injury.

16:23.720 --> 16:24.480
No big deal.

16:28.480 --> 16:29.300
Where's your hairpin?

16:31.490 --> 16:33.430
It was chaotic just now,
I lost it accidentally.

16:33.440 --> 16:34.320
I didn't look for it.

16:35.030 --> 16:35.630
What a shame.

16:35.910 --> 16:36.960
It's your favourite thing

16:37.030 --> 16:37.840
growing up.

16:38.560 --> 16:39.320
But it's okay.

16:39.560 --> 16:40.840
I'll order you a new one.

16:41.150 --> 16:42.910
It's okay, Young Master. Forget it.

16:43.030 --> 16:43.910
Are you tired?

16:44.030 --> 16:45.320
Let's go back and rest.

16:45.560 --> 16:47.390
I ordered someone to cook a table

16:47.570 --> 16:48.670
full of your favourite food.

16:48.960 --> 16:49.320
Let's go.

16:51.440 --> 16:52.710
Where is Lieutenant He's hairpin?

16:54.240 --> 16:55.320
How would I know?

16:55.620 --> 16:56.220
When I arrived,

16:56.240 --> 16:57.790
Lieutenant's hairpin was already gone.

16:58.750 --> 16:59.840
You're lying.

17:00.150 --> 17:02.240
That hairpin is gifted to Lieutenant He

17:02.360 --> 17:03.030
by her mother.

17:03.480 --> 17:05.280
Even if she died,

17:05.470 --> 17:06.910
she wouldn't lose the hairpin.

17:07.520 --> 17:09.270
Are you hiding something
with Lieutenant He?

17:09.760 --> 17:11.390
No. It's really missing.

17:11.520 --> 17:12.560
She's very upset.

17:12.950 --> 17:13.840
I stopped her

17:13.950 --> 17:15.150
from looking for it.

17:15.270 --> 17:16.080
It was too dangerous.

17:17.470 --> 17:18.520
I don't trust you.

17:23.507 --> 17:25.241
(Palace of Xichang)

17:29.560 --> 17:30.080
Look.

17:30.190 --> 17:31.390
How beautiful.

17:32.430 --> 17:33.840
Can I fly it higher?

17:34.120 --> 17:34.870
You can.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.040
You can.

17:36.250 --> 17:37.120
Madam, you're amazing.

17:37.190 --> 17:37.840
Will it fall?

17:37.950 --> 17:38.630
Higher.

17:38.800 --> 17:39.600
No.

17:39.800 --> 17:40.670
Higher. It won't fall.

17:42.390 --> 17:44.120
Look. It's so high and far.

17:44.190 --> 17:45.600
It's so high, Madam.

17:48.910 --> 17:49.320
Fly it.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.040
It's raising.

17:57.520 --> 17:58.670
Will it fall?

17:59.120 --> 18:00.080
No.

18:00.420 --> 18:01.510
- So beautiful.
- So high.

18:01.630 --> 18:02.910
It's raising. So high.

18:06.720 --> 18:07.630
Madam, you're amazing.

18:07.760 --> 18:08.190
Yes.

18:08.320 --> 18:09.390
Whose kite is that?

18:10.840 --> 18:11.560
Indeed.

18:11.670 --> 18:11.910
What?

18:13.320 --> 18:14.670
- It doesn't move.
- Be careful, Madam.

18:17.630 --> 18:18.230
This...

18:18.390 --> 18:18.840
Let's go.

18:29.950 --> 18:31.430
It's you.

18:32.910 --> 18:34.080
I didn't expect

18:34.230 --> 18:36.410
(First wife of Sun Jing, Madam of Wei)
you to still have the mood.

18:36.410 --> 18:37.390
(First wife of Sun Jing, Madam of Wei)

18:37.390 --> 18:38.560
However,

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
your kite and my kite

18:41.120 --> 18:42.600
are entangled.

18:44.760 --> 18:45.910
Cut it off.

18:48.280 --> 18:49.950
Since you said so,

18:50.520 --> 18:51.710
then cut it off.

18:53.360 --> 18:53.840
Yes.

18:58.840 --> 19:00.040
What are you doing?

19:02.430 --> 19:03.760
My kite

19:03.840 --> 19:05.320
is gifted by Grand Governor.

19:05.430 --> 19:06.630
It can't be lost.

19:07.080 --> 19:07.910
Therefore,

19:08.280 --> 19:10.190
we can only cut the line

19:10.320 --> 19:11.670
of your kite.

19:12.800 --> 19:15.870
Please forgive me, Madam of Wei.

19:18.320 --> 19:18.800
You...

19:21.950 --> 19:22.530
Let's go!

19:32.670 --> 19:34.470
Consort Xiao is so rude.

19:34.870 --> 19:35.430
Does she think

19:35.560 --> 19:36.630
she's still Crown Princess?

19:36.870 --> 19:38.520
She didn't even greet you.

19:38.630 --> 19:40.870
You're the first wife
of Grand Governor.

19:41.870 --> 19:44.470
Consort Xiao is relying on
her past relationship with Master.

19:44.950 --> 19:45.800
Right now Master

19:45.910 --> 19:47.520
is sympathizing her.

19:48.950 --> 19:50.080
Such a capricious

19:50.190 --> 19:51.630
and fickle woman.

19:52.120 --> 19:53.710
I don't want to think like her.

19:54.800 --> 19:55.430
Your Highness.

19:55.670 --> 19:57.870
Madam of Wei is
the first wife of Grand Governor.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.710
You're in an awkward situation now.

20:00.080 --> 20:02.000
Why did you make her angry

20:02.120 --> 20:03.430
because of such a small matter?

20:04.520 --> 20:05.950
If I want to send
the pregnant Jiang

20:06.080 --> 20:07.430
out of the palace,

20:07.870 --> 20:09.320
I have to do it through

20:09.430 --> 20:10.560
Madam of Wei.

20:11.320 --> 20:13.320
Even a dull knife with a chipped edge,

20:14.080 --> 20:15.520
when it's used right,

20:16.320 --> 20:17.560
can cut open

20:17.670 --> 20:19.190
the tightest cage.

21:08.870 --> 21:09.560
Lieutenant He.

21:14.230 --> 21:15.190
Let me have a look at

21:15.320 --> 21:16.080
how your wound is.

21:16.760 --> 21:17.430
No big deal.

21:17.560 --> 21:18.470
I've applied medicine

21:18.600 --> 21:19.630
and bandaged it.

21:23.080 --> 21:23.800
Alright.

21:24.630 --> 21:25.760
But in the coming days,

21:25.870 --> 21:27.320
we have to keep applying medicine.

21:27.560 --> 21:28.150
Or else,

21:28.230 --> 21:29.470
it may cause chronic pain.

21:29.670 --> 21:31.280
Okay, I'll listen to you.

21:32.840 --> 21:33.600
By the way, Taozi,

21:34.230 --> 21:34.910
this time

21:35.320 --> 21:37.150
He met Imperial Grandson, Li Ni.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.190
He was the one who you wanted to

21:39.360 --> 21:41.080
shoot in the cottage.

21:42.430 --> 21:43.760
It's him?

21:44.870 --> 21:46.360
Didn't you tell me that

21:46.470 --> 21:47.040
Li Ni

21:47.190 --> 21:48.710
is the guise of Zhenxi Army

21:49.000 --> 21:51.150
and surely is a useless idiot?

21:51.910 --> 21:53.710
I was wrong.

21:54.280 --> 21:56.910
This person is capable

21:57.080 --> 21:58.040
and very intelligent.

21:58.390 --> 21:59.470
Instead, we shouldn't

21:59.630 --> 22:00.910
take him lightly.

22:02.950 --> 22:04.120
I didn't expect

22:04.280 --> 22:05.470
Li family

22:06.040 --> 22:07.950
to have such an outstanding offspring.

22:08.910 --> 22:10.560
I haven't heard about him.

22:14.430 --> 22:15.870
So what if he's great?

22:16.120 --> 22:18.040
Is he as smart and capable
as our lieutenant?

22:18.910 --> 22:20.390
Sweet-talker.

22:20.520 --> 22:21.670
When I wasn't around,

22:21.800 --> 22:22.710
what did you eat?

22:23.230 --> 22:24.800
They cooked me pork shoulder.

22:25.870 --> 22:26.870
I didn't expect

22:27.120 --> 22:27.840
Young Master Cui

22:27.950 --> 22:29.630
to be a sentimental person.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.040
He saw Lady He left.

22:33.710 --> 22:35.320
Tender melancholy.

22:35.600 --> 22:37.710
Deplorable and sad.

22:39.470 --> 22:40.910
A young hero

22:41.190 --> 22:42.470
is always sentimental.

22:44.950 --> 22:45.470
Master.

22:46.390 --> 22:46.910
Master.

22:47.120 --> 22:48.460
A letter from outside of the city.

22:48.520 --> 22:50.120
Young Master Cui wrote it to you.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.000
Young Master Cui?

22:52.560 --> 22:54.320
Isn't Young Master Cui in the residence?

22:57.470 --> 22:57.870
Leave.

22:58.710 --> 22:59.320
Yes, Master.

23:12.630 --> 23:14.080
Young Master, Lieutenant He is here.

23:16.430 --> 23:16.870
Ying.

23:17.800 --> 23:19.080
I said I'll go to your tent,

23:19.230 --> 23:21.320
so you don't have to walk around
with your injury.

23:21.390 --> 23:21.950
Be careful.

23:22.080 --> 23:22.670
It's okay.

23:22.840 --> 23:23.710
Just a minor injury.

23:23.920 --> 23:25.120
Since we're in the military camp,

23:25.190 --> 23:27.210
it's better for me to come
to your tent to discuss.

23:27.230 --> 23:27.950
Follow the rules.

23:28.080 --> 23:29.000
Fortunately,

23:29.120 --> 23:30.560
you're back safely.

23:32.040 --> 23:32.520
By the way,

23:33.190 --> 23:35.320
what do you think
about the current situation?

23:36.390 --> 23:37.360
Although Zhenxi Army

23:37.520 --> 23:38.670
took down Wangzhou,

23:38.800 --> 23:40.670
without Bingzhou and Jianzhou,

23:40.840 --> 23:41.840
they can't

23:41.950 --> 23:43.320
move a step closer to Tong Pass.

23:43.840 --> 23:44.910
As for Xichang,

23:45.230 --> 23:46.390
it's even more out of reach.

23:47.470 --> 23:48.630
You're right.

23:48.800 --> 23:49.630
I think so too.

23:50.150 --> 23:52.190
I think since we have the military power,

23:52.260 --> 23:53.430
why don't we attack Bingzhou?

23:54.040 --> 23:55.430
When we have Bingzhou and Jianzhou,

23:55.670 --> 23:58.320
it doesn't matter if it's Sun Jing or Li Ni,

23:58.320 --> 24:00.120
they'll have to act
according to Cui Army.

24:01.670 --> 24:02.320
Young Master.

24:03.000 --> 24:03.670
This time

24:03.950 --> 24:05.840
I actually met Li Ni.

24:06.840 --> 24:08.000
This person

24:08.800 --> 24:09.870
can't be taken lightly.

24:10.430 --> 24:12.430
He's a rare opponent.

24:12.840 --> 24:14.870
We're the one
who should be on guard instead.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.910
What kind of person is he?

24:20.280 --> 24:21.950
That he made you say such things.

24:27.560 --> 24:28.430
This person

24:29.320 --> 24:30.390
is great,

24:31.000 --> 24:31.910
but it's not that

24:32.080 --> 24:33.120
we have no way

24:33.230 --> 24:34.630
to take down Bingzhou.

24:35.120 --> 24:36.250
We need a perfect strategy.

24:36.470 --> 24:37.600
What good way do you have

24:37.870 --> 24:38.950
to take down Bingzhou?

24:39.670 --> 24:40.870
Isn't General Pei Yuan

24:41.000 --> 24:42.150
in Wangzhou?

24:42.470 --> 24:43.430
Why don't we

24:43.600 --> 24:44.910
reminisce with him first?

24:45.150 --> 24:47.280
But we rarely have contact
with Zhenxi Army.

24:47.430 --> 24:50.150
On the contrary, we argued
because of military rations.

24:50.390 --> 24:51.320
I'm afraid

24:51.470 --> 24:53.320
they won't form allies
with us so easily.

24:53.520 --> 24:54.470
Even if we do,

24:54.920 --> 24:56.620
I'm afraid
they'll have different intentions.

24:57.430 --> 24:58.430
Don't worry.

24:58.560 --> 24:59.710
I have a way

24:59.870 --> 25:01.390
for them to agree to form allies.

25:01.560 --> 25:02.360
I also have a way

25:02.520 --> 25:04.000
to avoid different intentions.

25:06.800 --> 25:08.510
(The one in your residence is not me.)
I'm so angry.

25:08.800 --> 25:11.800
Cui family has crossed the line.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.040
What happened, Master?

25:13.190 --> 25:13.800
Go!

25:14.120 --> 25:16.280
Go get the fake Young Master Cui

25:16.390 --> 25:17.870
imprisoned right now.

25:18.840 --> 25:19.360
Yes, Master.

25:20.080 --> 25:23.040
No. Kill him immediately!

25:26.910 --> 25:27.600
Take him.

25:33.430 --> 25:34.910
What else do you want to say?

25:36.000 --> 25:36.560
Lord Han.

25:36.910 --> 25:37.800
I'll be honest.

25:38.230 --> 25:40.040
I'm Young Master Cui's study partner.

25:40.430 --> 25:41.950
I got his order to come here

25:41.980 --> 25:43.600
and discuss something important with you.

25:44.910 --> 25:45.520
Unexpectedly,

25:45.910 --> 25:47.710
you mistook me as Young Master Cui.

25:48.420 --> 25:49.940
Under the instruction of Lieutenant He,

25:50.430 --> 25:51.710
I took advantage of the mistake.

25:52.280 --> 25:53.080
But I didn't intent

25:53.230 --> 25:54.670
to lie to you.

25:55.950 --> 25:57.950
I went through
fire and water for Cui family.

25:58.280 --> 25:59.390
But I didn't expect them

26:00.560 --> 26:01.840
to betray me today,

26:02.280 --> 26:03.800
let alone being abandoned.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.150
Since you know that you're abandoned,

26:11.000 --> 26:12.430
what other use do you have?

26:13.470 --> 26:13.950
Lord Han.

26:14.800 --> 26:16.100
Since Cui family is unkind to me,

26:16.470 --> 26:17.710
I'll return this injustice.

26:18.360 --> 26:19.280
I have a plan

26:19.840 --> 26:21.800
that can solve your urgency.

26:25.630 --> 26:27.230
I know that Cui Army has robbed

26:27.360 --> 26:28.800
the ration of Zhenxi Army.

26:28.910 --> 26:30.800
Zhenxi Army is desperate of ration.

26:31.150 --> 26:33.600
They hate Cui Army's guts.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.080
Why don't you send someone to Wangzhou

26:36.360 --> 26:39.630
to discuss an ally with Li Ni

26:39.800 --> 26:41.080
to destroy Cui Army?

26:41.600 --> 26:42.910
You'll be rescued

26:42.980 --> 26:44.470
and Zhenxi Army will get their ration.

26:49.760 --> 26:50.430
Master.

26:51.230 --> 26:53.080
He has got his points.

26:54.800 --> 26:55.840
Our spy

26:56.000 --> 26:57.320
has also reported

26:57.560 --> 26:58.630
about the robbed ration.

27:00.150 --> 27:00.760
I'm just someone

27:00.910 --> 27:02.190
abandoned by Cui family.

27:02.630 --> 27:03.760
I have nothing.

27:05.430 --> 27:08.360
Only you can give me a chance to live.

27:09.280 --> 27:09.910
Lord Han.

27:10.120 --> 27:12.470
Why don't you have someone
get the opinion of Zhenxi Army?

27:13.670 --> 27:14.470
As for me,

27:15.080 --> 27:16.390
you don't have to

27:16.560 --> 27:17.800
kill me instantly.

27:18.280 --> 27:19.800
If Zhenxi Army doesn't agree,

27:20.230 --> 27:22.470
it's not too late to kill me then.

27:23.430 --> 27:25.000
If this plan works,

27:25.470 --> 27:26.840
I'm willing to follow you

27:27.470 --> 27:28.800
and be at your service.

27:32.870 --> 27:34.080
Take him down

27:34.670 --> 27:35.520
and imprison him.

27:36.630 --> 27:37.070
Come along.

27:52.080 --> 27:52.950
The prisoner is here.

27:53.360 --> 27:54.230
Keep him in this cell.

28:10.240 --> 28:12.115
(Guo Residence)

28:18.080 --> 28:18.760
General Pei Yuan.

28:19.280 --> 28:20.190
Mister Shiqi is found.

28:21.000 --> 28:21.560
Really?

28:22.710 --> 28:23.230
Where is he?

28:23.760 --> 28:24.870
Cui Army reported

28:25.080 --> 28:25.870
that Mister Shiqi

28:26.080 --> 28:27.600
is in Han Li's residence in Bingzhou.

28:28.600 --> 28:29.490
What is he doing there?

28:30.670 --> 28:32.710
I asked, but she didn't want to answer.

28:33.150 --> 28:35.360
She wants to see you
and report the details in person.

28:35.630 --> 28:36.670
See me in person?

28:37.430 --> 28:38.120
Who is that?

28:39.390 --> 28:41.080
She's a very fierce young lady.

28:41.630 --> 28:42.950
She knows how to use poison

28:43.080 --> 28:44.000
and fight.

28:44.190 --> 28:45.600
She's fierce and formidable.

28:47.280 --> 28:48.800
Greetings, General Pei Yuan.

28:50.760 --> 28:51.470
Raise.

28:53.320 --> 28:54.360
Lieutenant He

28:54.520 --> 28:56.120
sent me here to see you.

28:56.710 --> 28:58.150
The whereabouts of Li Ni

28:58.320 --> 28:59.520
is a present

28:59.670 --> 29:01.600
from Cui Army to you.

29:01.950 --> 29:02.630
With this

29:02.760 --> 29:05.000
we would like to show
the sincerity of Cui Army.

29:05.360 --> 29:06.230
Speaking of which,

29:06.520 --> 29:08.120
Li Ni and Lieutenant He

29:08.280 --> 29:09.600
are quite fated.

29:09.950 --> 29:10.950
Awhile ago,

29:11.040 --> 29:13.190
Lieutenant He saved Li Ni
a couple of times.

29:13.390 --> 29:14.150
This time

29:14.320 --> 29:15.800
she also doesn't want to see him dead.

29:16.190 --> 29:17.560
Therefore, Cui Army

29:17.710 --> 29:19.390
is willing to form an ally with you

29:19.560 --> 29:21.000
to rescue Li Ni.

29:22.390 --> 29:22.870
Really?

29:26.870 --> 29:28.190
Lieutenant He said

29:28.320 --> 29:29.520
if I say this,

29:29.670 --> 29:32.000
you'll most likely not believe me.

29:32.230 --> 29:33.150
However,

29:33.320 --> 29:34.280
you can send someone

29:34.430 --> 29:35.950
to find it out in Bingzhou.

29:36.120 --> 29:38.560
Then you'll know
if we're speaking the truth.

29:38.710 --> 29:40.800
General Pei Yuan. Gen...

29:48.800 --> 29:50.520
Lieutenant He also said

29:50.670 --> 29:52.280
if I arrive at the right time,

29:52.600 --> 29:53.670
at this point

29:53.870 --> 29:55.280
Han Li from Bingzhou

29:55.470 --> 29:56.760
will also send someone

29:56.910 --> 29:59.600
to discuss an important issue with you.

30:00.000 --> 30:00.910
I wonder

30:01.080 --> 30:02.670
if Han Li sent someone over.

30:03.390 --> 30:04.150
This young lady

30:04.320 --> 30:05.760
is really accurate.

30:07.280 --> 30:09.670
Han Li really sent someone over?

30:14.390 --> 30:15.000
Yes.

30:16.320 --> 30:16.710
See.

30:17.280 --> 30:19.520
Our lieutenant has
taken everything into account.

30:34.320 --> 30:35.040
Mister Shiqi.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.120
We brought many people to save you.

30:37.520 --> 30:38.150
How many?

30:38.470 --> 30:39.430
Six.

30:40.190 --> 30:40.800
Go back.

30:46.630 --> 30:47.840
What's wrong?

30:49.560 --> 30:51.190
I don't know what happened,

30:51.840 --> 30:53.710
my stomach isn't feeling well.

30:54.560 --> 30:55.360
My stomach grumbles.

30:55.470 --> 30:56.470
Hurry back.

30:57.560 --> 30:58.230
Okay.

31:04.320 --> 31:04.950
Lieutenant He.

31:05.320 --> 31:06.190
Do you really think

31:06.390 --> 31:07.910
we can work with Zhenxi Army?

31:10.120 --> 31:12.120
The marshal of Zhenxi Army, Li Ni,

31:12.230 --> 31:13.630
is the smartest

31:13.800 --> 31:15.280
and trickiest person I've seen.

31:15.840 --> 31:16.910
Even if you restrain him

31:17.040 --> 31:18.320
with metal chains,

31:18.470 --> 31:19.470
(put him in a box,)

31:19.630 --> 31:21.950
(tie it to a rock
and then sink him into the river.)

31:22.760 --> 31:24.120
(In a blink of an eye,)

31:24.430 --> 31:25.840
(he'll float to the surface)

31:26.040 --> 31:26.710
and with a smile

31:26.870 --> 31:28.040
he'll trick you back.

31:28.950 --> 31:30.360
Of course we can

31:30.630 --> 31:32.280
work with such a smart person.

31:32.560 --> 31:34.230
Why are you so sure

31:34.390 --> 31:35.840
that Li Ni

31:35.950 --> 31:37.760
can persuade Han Li

31:37.910 --> 31:39.150
to send someone to see Pei Yuan?

31:40.560 --> 31:41.520
Li Ni

31:41.670 --> 31:42.150
is an expert

31:42.360 --> 31:43.560
in escaping death.

31:43.710 --> 31:45.150
I'm very sure

31:45.220 --> 31:46.670
that we'll be able to persuade Han Li

31:46.760 --> 31:48.630
and set up a double-trick trap for him.

31:48.950 --> 31:49.950
In that case,

31:50.080 --> 31:50.760
why don't we

31:50.870 --> 31:52.150
take advantage of his trap

31:52.320 --> 31:53.760
to make it our trap?

31:54.280 --> 31:56.360
You're quite capable.

31:57.430 --> 31:59.000
Pei Yuan actually agreed

31:59.360 --> 32:01.280
to work with us

32:01.430 --> 32:03.470
to attack Cui Army from both sides.

32:04.280 --> 32:05.280
However,

32:06.080 --> 32:07.760
he has one term.

32:08.520 --> 32:11.760
Other than keeping the food supplies
of Cui Army,

32:12.670 --> 32:15.760
he wants to take the passage
via Jianzhou to the south.

32:16.390 --> 32:17.150
To be honest,

32:17.710 --> 32:19.670
if Pei Yuan didn't have any terms,

32:20.670 --> 32:22.760
you shouldn't even believe him.

32:23.870 --> 32:25.390
Since he brought up a condition,

32:26.280 --> 32:27.190
I think

32:27.710 --> 32:29.430
this is most likely going to work.

32:30.520 --> 32:31.800
Tell me more.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.080
You can pretend to agree to his passage.

32:36.560 --> 32:38.080
Jianzhou has a dangerous terrain.

32:38.800 --> 32:42.710
Your garrison can make use of the terrain
to attack with lesser manpower.

32:43.870 --> 32:46.280
When Zhenxi Army is in Xialuo Valley,

32:49.230 --> 32:51.080
by clutching them from front and back,

32:51.670 --> 32:53.430
we can severely damage Zhenxi Army.

32:54.600 --> 32:55.800
First destroy Cui Army,

32:56.320 --> 32:57.710
then severely damage Zhenxi Army.

32:58.470 --> 32:59.320
Then,

33:00.560 --> 33:01.630
even Grand Governor Sun

33:01.800 --> 33:02.840
in the capital

33:03.520 --> 33:05.150
can no longer oppress you.

33:10.710 --> 33:12.280
You've read books on art of war?

33:13.120 --> 33:14.800
I'm the study partner
of Young Master Cui.

33:15.280 --> 33:16.560
The four arts of Chinese scholar,

33:16.720 --> 33:18.000
military leadership and strategy,

33:18.470 --> 33:19.390
I've studied them all.

33:21.840 --> 33:22.870
Very well.

33:24.150 --> 33:25.430
You're a talented person.

33:26.120 --> 33:27.080
I'm flattered, Lord Han.

33:27.560 --> 33:28.670
I'm born in a chaotic world.

33:29.560 --> 33:31.120
I just want to survive.

33:31.800 --> 33:33.120
I'm willing to

33:33.800 --> 33:35.280
be at your service.

33:37.910 --> 33:39.190
I still have to

33:39.600 --> 33:41.280
test your capabilities.

33:41.710 --> 33:44.390
I'm sorry
that you still have to stay in the prison.

33:45.320 --> 33:46.040
In the future,

33:46.390 --> 33:48.560
if I really am able
to damage Zhenxi Army,

33:49.360 --> 33:51.120
I'll release you

33:51.600 --> 33:53.430
and make you my adviser.

33:54.080 --> 33:55.190
Thank you, Lord Han.

33:57.910 --> 33:59.520
Why are you behaving oddly

33:59.670 --> 34:00.910
every time you mention Li Ni?

34:01.390 --> 34:02.520
How odd?

34:04.230 --> 34:05.320
You seem to hate him

34:05.470 --> 34:06.800
very much.

34:08.040 --> 34:08.960
Don't I?

34:09.400 --> 34:10.520
In that case,

34:10.790 --> 34:11.960
why must we save him?

34:16.920 --> 34:18.270
He's such an interesting person.

34:18.790 --> 34:20.270
It'll be a shame if he dies.

34:24.480 --> 34:25.350
That's true.

34:25.670 --> 34:26.600
I've never heard you

34:26.710 --> 34:28.120
describe someone this way.

34:28.400 --> 34:29.400
I've also not heard

34:29.520 --> 34:30.350
you call anyone

34:30.520 --> 34:31.400
as your opponent.

34:31.560 --> 34:32.520
Who's your opponent?

34:33.830 --> 34:34.520
Young Master.

34:40.120 --> 34:40.710
Nothing.

34:40.880 --> 34:42.190
I'm just chatting with Taozi.

34:42.560 --> 34:43.080
Ying.

34:43.600 --> 34:45.120
I have something for you.

34:45.960 --> 34:47.750
The hairpin your mother left you...

34:48.190 --> 34:48.750
I know

34:49.400 --> 34:50.830
you must be sad to have lost it.

34:51.920 --> 34:52.350
Look.

34:53.120 --> 34:54.940
Doesn't it look
very similar to your old one?

34:58.190 --> 34:59.270
It does.

34:59.710 --> 35:00.630
I made it myself.

35:02.790 --> 35:04.230
Let me put it on.

35:07.630 --> 35:08.440
Young Master.

35:09.230 --> 35:10.670
The old hairpin

35:11.520 --> 35:13.190
has a different meaning to me.

35:14.440 --> 35:15.560
Even if they look alike,

35:16.000 --> 35:17.350
I don't want to replace the old one

35:17.520 --> 35:18.630
with another hairpin.

35:21.230 --> 35:22.600
Thank you for your thought.

35:22.880 --> 35:23.630
I'll keep

35:24.000 --> 35:25.600
this hairpin safely.

35:28.350 --> 35:28.790
Okay.

35:35.270 --> 35:36.150
Ying.

35:37.750 --> 35:38.670
Don't you think

35:38.830 --> 35:40.440
I have no idea about your plan.

35:42.230 --> 35:43.630
When I'm out,

35:44.400 --> 35:45.830
I'll deal with you about this.

36:00.670 --> 36:02.150
Lord Han told me to visit you.

36:02.960 --> 36:05.520
He's afraid that you'll be upset.

36:06.190 --> 36:07.000
Lord Han is so kind.

36:07.400 --> 36:08.310
Thank you, Mister Lv.

36:08.790 --> 36:09.560
I'm not upset.

36:10.830 --> 36:12.190
I'm abandoned by Cui Army.

36:12.630 --> 36:13.920
Thanks to Lord Han

36:14.120 --> 36:15.150
for sparing my life

36:15.310 --> 36:16.750
and listening to my plans.

36:16.920 --> 36:18.040
I'm more than grateful,

36:18.230 --> 36:19.440
why would I be upset?

36:22.270 --> 36:22.830
Okay.

36:23.440 --> 36:25.120
I knew you're an open-minded person.

36:25.350 --> 36:26.710
I brought some good liquor along.

36:27.560 --> 36:28.310
Let's have a drink.

36:36.630 --> 36:37.670
This liquor smells good.

36:38.870 --> 36:40.220
This is a fine liquor of Lord Han,

36:40.270 --> 36:41.350
of course it smells good.

36:41.790 --> 36:42.520
You're right.

36:43.960 --> 36:44.960
The enemy is attacking.

36:44.960 --> 36:46.820
- Something bad happened.
- The enemy is attacking.

36:46.968 --> 36:49.359
(Zhenxi)

36:51.492 --> 36:54.976
(Li)

36:54.977 --> 36:58.843
(Which)

37:05.630 --> 37:06.270
Send my order,

37:07.000 --> 37:07.790
attack!

37:08.040 --> 37:10.270
In this war we're charging in on horseback.

37:10.320 --> 37:12.210
Even more fun
than attacking Wangzhou last time.

37:12.750 --> 37:14.630
Youren, have you ridden a horse before?

37:15.190 --> 37:16.520
When I learned to ride a horse,

37:16.710 --> 37:18.120
you were just a foolish child.

37:19.230 --> 37:20.790
Take down Bingzhou! Charge!

37:20.960 --> 37:27.230
Charge!

37:27.800 --> 37:31.031
(Zhenxi)

37:32.920 --> 37:34.230
I'll send someone to find out.

37:34.400 --> 37:34.830
Hurry.

37:35.000 --> 37:35.400
Yes.

37:42.350 --> 37:42.830
Here.

37:43.520 --> 37:46.040
Let's drink this up.

37:46.190 --> 37:47.310
Sorry for the past.

37:47.630 --> 37:48.270
In the future,

37:48.790 --> 37:49.960
please share your guidance.

37:50.080 --> 37:50.600
Here.

37:56.520 --> 37:57.120
Good liquor.

38:00.710 --> 38:01.830
Young man.

38:02.880 --> 38:05.750
We've known each other for awhile.

38:05.960 --> 38:08.520
It feels like we've
known each other all along.

38:10.080 --> 38:11.270
But I don't know

38:11.600 --> 38:13.080
what your name is

38:13.230 --> 38:14.310
and where you're from.

38:14.790 --> 38:16.400
How did you become

38:16.560 --> 38:18.120
Young Master Cui's study partner?

38:18.350 --> 38:19.750
Tell me about it.

38:21.880 --> 38:22.710
Well,

38:23.150 --> 38:24.230
it's a long story.

38:25.440 --> 38:28.560
I can only tell you
in details in awhile.

38:31.310 --> 38:32.750
Why

38:32.960 --> 38:34.480
in awhile?

38:53.150 --> 38:53.880
What's that noise?

39:12.000 --> 39:13.480
I can tell you now.

39:15.150 --> 39:16.190
My name is Li Ni.

39:16.880 --> 39:18.120
I'm the seventeenth one.

39:18.710 --> 39:20.040
The grandson of the late emperor.

39:20.350 --> 39:21.520
The son of Lord Liang.

39:22.190 --> 39:23.750
The marshal of Zhenxi Army.

39:24.600 --> 39:25.830
Bringing peace to the world

39:26.750 --> 39:28.270
and killing all the rebels.

39:29.670 --> 39:30.440
Remember that.
