=Episode 19=

01:56.770 --> 01:57.555
Don't worry, Dad.

01:57.560 --> 01:58.710
Ananda has prepared a fast horse.

01:58.720 --> 01:59.900
If the war situation
is unfavorable,

01:59.915 --> 02:02.035
Ananda will definitely accompany your father's
retreat to the south.

02:02.040 --> 02:04.310
As long as entering the banks of the Jiangnan River,
with the natural dangers there,

02:04.356 --> 02:05.835
we will definitely be fine.

02:05.850 --> 02:07.596
Father, if the war situation
is unfavorable,

02:07.716 --> 02:08.835
Ananda is willing to stay here

02:08.840 --> 02:10.610
lead the rearguard
to block the enemy's forces.

02:10.796 --> 02:13.756
At that time, please
go first with your father.

02:16.115 --> 02:17.115
Second Sister,

02:17.720 --> 02:19.310
Your loyalty and courage
are truly commendable.

02:19.875 --> 02:21.275
Brother is the eldest son.

02:21.555 --> 02:25.636
In the future, this country and your father
will have to rely on Big Brother.

02:25.796 --> 02:27.796
If I could stay here
to intercept the enemy forces

02:27.875 --> 02:29.395
and protect the safety
of your Father and Sister,

02:29.516 --> 02:31.516
even if I die, that is also worth it.

02:35.275 --> 02:38.956
Lai'er is really
a good, filial child.

02:41.115 --> 02:41.956
Second Sister.

02:42.196 --> 02:43.275
Second Sister, you can't...

02:43.356 --> 02:44.916
His Majesty!

02:45.356 --> 02:46.036
His Majesty!

02:46.675 --> 02:47.435
Report, Your Majesty!

02:47.555 --> 02:48.675
There's news from the front lines!

02:48.756 --> 02:49.316
Say it quickly!

02:49.675 --> 02:51.356
King Qin has captured
West Changjing.

02:52.236 --> 02:53.155
Congratulations, His Majesty.

02:53.196 --> 02:54.395
King Qin defeats Sun Jing

02:54.516 --> 02:56.995
and had charged into
West Changjing with his troops.

02:58.115 --> 02:59.636
What?

03:00.875 --> 03:02.316
- Congratulations, Father!
- Congratulations, Father!

03:02.636 --> 03:03.995
Your father is protected and blessed by Heaven

03:04.000 --> 03:05.780
so that the new King of Qin could
retake West Changjing!

03:05.796 --> 03:06.440
Congratulations, Dad!

03:06.620 --> 03:07.829
His father placed King Qin
in an important position

03:07.830 --> 03:09.380
so that the new King of Qin could
retake West Changjing!

03:09.395 --> 03:10.669
Your father looks far ahead

03:10.670 --> 03:11.800
and this is a
blessing for this country!

03:11.875 --> 03:13.555
Good! Very good!

03:15.875 --> 03:17.675
Counselor Wu's words were true.

03:17.875 --> 03:20.675
I am destined to be emperor.

03:21.076 --> 03:23.395
As long as I ascend the throne as emperor,

03:23.516 --> 03:27.196
all the people in this country
will be saved.

03:27.476 --> 03:29.476
- Congratulations, Father!
- Congratulations, Your Majesty!

04:07.510 --> 04:13.660
(Istana Chaoqian)

04:29.436 --> 04:30.876
That year, when he was 16 years old,

04:32.250 --> 04:33.380
according to tradition,
I must enter the palace

04:33.385 --> 04:34.950
to bid farewell
to the Former Emperor

04:35.035 --> 04:36.556
before leaving for Laolan Border.

04:38.915 --> 04:40.556
At that time, I made a mistake.

04:41.196 --> 04:42.795
The Former Emperor was furious

04:43.676 --> 04:44.715
and not willing to meet me.

04:46.035 --> 04:47.556
He sent someone
to convey a message to me

04:48.560 --> 04:50.116
so that I am satisfied with my fate,
do my duty,

04:50.996 --> 04:52.996
and stop tarnishing the reputation of
the descendants of the Li Family.

04:54.436 --> 04:56.395
His Majesty has now reclaimed
West Changjing.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.155
This will comfort
the soul of the Past Emperor in heaven.

05:07.076 --> 05:09.876
What about the person
chasing Sun Jing?

05:11.235 --> 05:12.835
After several times
of close combat,

05:12.996 --> 05:14.275
we still can't hold them.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.310
Sun Jing's trusted deputy general
protected him tooth and nail.

05:17.516 --> 05:20.235
Sun Jing should still be
unconscious now.

05:20.835 --> 05:22.076
They fought while retreating

05:22.155 --> 05:24.000
and had also retreated all the way
to the Tong Border that night.

05:24.676 --> 05:25.876
What about Great General Cui?

05:26.316 --> 05:27.395
After capturing the city,

05:27.410 --> 05:29.155
Great General Cui led troops
into the palace,

05:29.170 --> 05:30.556
then got off the horse
in front of Jianyuan Hall

05:30.560 --> 05:31.730
and entered Yunxiao Terrace
from the back.

05:31.956 --> 05:35.035
He said one sentence,
"My enthusiasm has faded, that's all",

05:35.180 --> 05:36.290
then led the troops
out of the palace

05:36.316 --> 05:38.355
and headed for the Cui Family Army headquarters
outside the city.

05:40.116 --> 05:41.395
"Just that".

05:42.835 --> 05:46.516
I also want to be the same as him,
after capturing the city and killing the enemy,

05:46.835 --> 05:50.235
then finally said "that's it"
and left.

05:52.756 --> 05:54.956
That was the style
of a true general.

05:56.076 --> 05:56.795
Honourable,

05:57.756 --> 05:59.915
You and him are not the same.

06:00.355 --> 06:03.355
However, I am currently
very jealous of him.

06:07.155 --> 06:08.530
His Majesty came out
of Laolan Border,

06:08.610 --> 06:10.770
leads an army to rescue
the emperor and quell the rebellion.

06:10.795 --> 06:12.636
Now, you have reclaimed
West Changjing.

06:13.076 --> 06:16.395
So, from now on,
you are different from everyone.

06:16.795 --> 06:19.436
You also can no longer say
you are jealous of other people.

06:21.475 --> 06:23.795
That's right, it's really boring.

06:28.395 --> 06:29.196
Di mana Ying?

06:29.956 --> 06:31.756
Was he out of town
with Great General Cui?

06:37.475 --> 06:39.516
It turns out this is the royal palace.

06:40.316 --> 06:41.196
Commander,

06:41.835 --> 06:44.155
here besides
the building is a little taller

06:44.235 --> 06:46.715
and the house is a little bigger,
nothing seems different.

06:47.556 --> 06:48.196
Look at it.

06:48.475 --> 06:49.996
Where we live now

06:50.355 --> 06:51.915
named Yuhui Pavilion.

06:52.475 --> 06:54.475
Ahead is the Jianyuan Hall,

06:55.116 --> 06:56.116
Aula Qianzheng,

06:56.355 --> 06:57.275
dan Aula Jingde.

06:58.610 --> 06:59.990
These were all the places
of the emperors of previous dynasties

06:59.996 --> 07:01.035
take care of governance.

07:03.155 --> 07:05.715
Behind the high wall
is the Palace of the Crown Prince,

07:06.076 --> 07:07.676
which borders
this Yuhui Pavilion.

07:07.835 --> 07:09.915
Further back
is the harem palace.

07:12.516 --> 07:15.475
How many people can live
in such a big house?

07:16.275 --> 07:19.395
The emperor had dozens of sons
and hundreds of grandchildren.

07:19.516 --> 07:20.756
There are many descendants.

07:20.915 --> 07:23.756
If the palace does not fit,
the respective kings will be given

07:23.835 --> 07:26.035
residence outside the palace
to live in after marriage.

07:27.116 --> 07:28.076
Sadly,

07:28.636 --> 07:29.835
Sun Jing rebelled

07:30.316 --> 07:33.915
and wiped out almost all of
the descendants of the Li Family.

07:40.116 --> 07:41.035
King Qin came.

07:45.676 --> 07:46.116
Ying,

07:46.915 --> 07:48.595
I want to ask for your help
on one thing.

07:49.116 --> 07:50.045
Which matter?

07:50.275 --> 07:51.676
The Previous Crown Princess, Madam Xiao,

07:52.200 --> 07:53.700
has endured humiliation
and carried heavy burdens.

07:53.915 --> 07:56.915
For the sake of poisoning Sun Jing,
he himself was also poisoned

07:57.835 --> 07:59.196
and now his life is in danger.

07:59.676 --> 08:01.395
I want to ask Taozi to treat him.

08:01.676 --> 08:02.876
Because I'm not free,

08:02.996 --> 08:04.355
please replace me
to take care of him.

08:08.556 --> 08:10.516
It turns out he was the one who poisoned Sun Jing.

08:15.516 --> 08:16.316
Don't worry.

08:16.636 --> 08:17.835
For someone who
upholds justice so much,

08:18.116 --> 08:19.436
I will definitely not disappoint you.

08:28.996 --> 08:30.436
This lip color box is the poison.

08:30.756 --> 08:31.795
Madam said,

08:32.235 --> 08:33.875
if he poisons food,

08:34.956 --> 08:36.796
afraid that Sun Jing would notice.

08:37.076 --> 08:38.875
So, he put poison
in the lip color.

08:39.676 --> 08:43.676
Madam also said that
this poison has a sweet aroma

08:43.995 --> 08:47.956
and only the floral scent of the lip color
can mask the scent.

08:48.396 --> 08:50.276
Besides, there is only
one chance.

08:50.475 --> 08:52.355
On the day the city was attacked,

08:52.835 --> 08:55.355
he immediately smeared the poison
on his own lips

08:55.635 --> 08:58.635
without caring at all, this poison
will also attack his heart.

08:59.916 --> 09:00.715
Mrs

09:01.875 --> 09:04.635
was determined to die with him.

09:35.918 --> 09:39.144
(Luoyang)

09:56.475 --> 09:58.715
- Greetings to your father.
- Greetings to your father.

10:00.036 --> 10:00.956
No need to be formal.

10:00.970 --> 10:02.510
- Thank you, Father.
- Thank you, Father.

10:03.715 --> 10:06.355
The King of Qin sent an army
outside the city to welcome.

10:07.396 --> 10:09.595
As emperor,

10:10.196 --> 10:13.515
I must appear grand
when I return to West Changjing

10:13.715 --> 10:16.276
to receive congratulations
from the officials.

10:18.515 --> 10:21.945
Father, there are several things

10:22.276 --> 10:24.041
which I don't know if I should
say it or not.

10:24.096 --> 10:25.916
You don't need to hesitate. Say.

10:27.436 --> 10:29.475
Now King Qin has reclaimed
West Changjing

10:29.530 --> 10:31.110
and make
unmatched contributions.

10:31.196 --> 10:34.636
How will your father reward
the King of Qin?

10:34.995 --> 10:35.705
This...

10:36.635 --> 10:38.588
He is my son.

10:39.036 --> 10:41.595
After all, isn't
sharing his father's burden

10:42.156 --> 10:43.635
is it an obligation?

10:43.755 --> 10:45.355
Why should you be rewarded?

10:45.715 --> 10:48.396
Your father has crowned
the Third Brother as the King of Qin.

10:48.715 --> 10:53.196
Among the kings,
only the title of King of Qin is the highest.

10:53.316 --> 10:55.396
If rewarded again,

10:55.715 --> 10:57.956
he could only be crowned
Crown Prince.

11:00.235 --> 11:02.355
You said you appointed him
Crown Prince?

11:02.835 --> 11:05.595
By direct line of descent,
he has no rights.

11:05.995 --> 11:08.916
Tell me, why should he be
appointed Crown Prince?

11:11.475 --> 11:12.676
If at this time your father

11:12.720 --> 11:14.515
did not intend to appoint the Third Brother
as Crown Prince

11:14.595 --> 11:16.515
while he is not rewarded

11:17.076 --> 11:18.196
even though he has made a great contribution,

11:18.316 --> 11:20.355
afraid that there would be people
with ulterior motives

11:20.475 --> 11:23.036
which incites the three forces
to rebel

11:23.156 --> 11:24.235
and the situation will be serious.

11:26.355 --> 11:28.115
This is... rebellion?

11:29.156 --> 11:30.835
This...

11:30.995 --> 11:31.956
Don't panic, Dad.

11:32.436 --> 11:33.635
After returning to the palace,

11:33.650 --> 11:35.110
Your father can open
the palace treasury.

11:35.316 --> 11:36.916
It is said that Sun Jing left
in a hurry

11:37.036 --> 11:39.835
and do not bring valuables
that are in the palace treasury.

11:40.556 --> 11:41.956
Treasury?

11:42.649 --> 11:43.635
Right, your father.

11:43.884 --> 11:46.036
What if your father
opened the palace treasury

11:46.120 --> 11:46.810
and provide rewards

11:46.810 --> 11:48.710
to the soldiers
who reclaimed West Changjing?

11:48.796 --> 11:51.956
The soldiers will surely be
grateful for His Majesty's gift.

11:52.196 --> 11:55.556
Even if someone incites,
they will not join in making trouble.

11:57.556 --> 11:59.635
Jun'er and Lai'er's methods are indeed good.

12:00.995 --> 12:04.595
Once I return to West Changjing,
I will open the palace treasury

12:04.916 --> 12:06.436
and give rewards
to all three teams.

12:09.635 --> 12:13.676
His Majesty's goodness is great,
beneficial for the country forever.

12:13.796 --> 12:16.715
Long live forever!

12:17.235 --> 12:19.595
(Chaoqian Palace)
His Majesty's virtue is great,

12:19.715 --> 12:21.156
beneficial to the country forever.

12:21.396 --> 12:23.595
Long live forever!

12:23.715 --> 12:24.396
Mrs.

12:24.715 --> 12:25.755
Madam, are you awake?

12:27.355 --> 12:28.433
Madam, you are awake.

12:28.475 --> 12:29.235
It's good to be aware.

12:29.355 --> 12:31.076
That means the effects of the poison have subsided.

12:31.875 --> 12:37.355
Long live His Majesty!

12:44.316 --> 12:45.755
Outside...

12:46.796 --> 12:48.355
What's that sound outside?

12:48.665 --> 12:49.676
Mrs,

12:49.744 --> 12:51.624
You've been unconscious
for days.

12:52.250 --> 12:53.510
By leading
the Western Border Army,

12:53.591 --> 12:55.591
His Majesty the King of Qin
has reclaimed West Changjing,

12:55.930 --> 12:57.311
then welcomed His Majesty
back to the palace.

12:57.792 --> 12:58.671
Today,

12:59.272 --> 13:01.032
He received congratulations
from the officials.

13:01.431 --> 13:02.551
That voice outside

13:03.591 --> 13:05.632
was the
grateful voice of the third team.

13:07.512 --> 13:10.619
We... we won.

13:11.752 --> 13:13.191
Be careful, madam.

13:13.632 --> 13:16.152
We... we won.

13:18.232 --> 13:19.992
We won.

13:21.054 --> 13:22.308
Don't worry, madam.

13:22.392 --> 13:24.912
We won.

13:38.010 --> 13:41.603
Who are these two ladies?

13:42.087 --> 13:45.392
Madam, this is Commander He
of the Cui Family Army.

13:46.101 --> 13:49.155
He was asked by King Qin
to come and treat his Lady.

13:49.399 --> 13:51.639
Thanks to Miss Taozi
brought by Commander He,

13:51.730 --> 13:53.272
who dispenses medicine
carefully every day,

13:54.232 --> 13:56.351
The poison in Madam finally disappeared.

14:06.529 --> 14:08.568
Thank you, Commander He.

14:11.002 --> 14:12.162
Madam upholds justice

14:12.790 --> 14:14.255
and save everyone
in this country.

14:14.926 --> 14:16.566
I should be the one
thanking Madam

14:16.591 --> 14:18.071
represents everyone in this country.

14:19.364 --> 14:21.324
I don't deserve
Madam's thanks.

14:34.493 --> 14:35.812
This palace is not bad.

14:38.396 --> 14:40.676
It's just that these curtains are a bit worn.

14:41.350 --> 14:42.450
Replace everything with new ones.

14:42.475 --> 14:43.036
Good.

14:57.595 --> 14:58.995
Greetings to your father.

14:59.120 --> 15:00.036
No need to be formal.

15:01.475 --> 15:03.240
King Qin, what a coincidence you came.

15:03.316 --> 15:07.036
This time, you made a huge contribution
in reclaiming West Changjing.

15:07.475 --> 15:09.835
Say, what gift
do you want?

15:10.076 --> 15:12.396
Gold and silver or fiefdoms?

15:13.001 --> 15:13.521
His Majesty,

15:13.956 --> 15:15.475
Ananda did not want
any gifts.

15:16.196 --> 15:17.438
Ananda wants to ask for orders.

15:17.810 --> 15:19.810
After Ananda sent people
to find the Emperor's First Grandson,

15:19.875 --> 15:22.276
please His Majesty agree to welcome
back the Emperor's First Grandson.

15:22.835 --> 15:23.796
The Emperor's First Grandson?

15:24.276 --> 15:25.635
When Sun Jing rebelled,

15:25.690 --> 15:27.635
he killed the First Emperor
and the First Crown Prince.

15:28.076 --> 15:29.755
Fortunately Han Chang, General Yunchang,

15:29.770 --> 15:31.380
protect the Emperor's First Grandson
to escape.

15:31.956 --> 15:32.515
His Majesty,

15:33.115 --> 15:33.916
The Emperor's First Grandson

15:34.156 --> 15:35.916
is a direct descendant
of the First Emperor.

15:36.420 --> 15:38.310
Please His Majesty agree to welcome
back the Emperor's First Grandson

15:38.515 --> 15:39.835
and set him as the crown prince.

15:42.316 --> 15:45.916
This is a big problem,
I have to consider it first.

15:45.956 --> 15:47.875
His Majesty, the First Emperor passed away

15:47.880 --> 15:49.330
and the Former Crown Prince
sacrificed for the country.

15:49.595 --> 15:52.475
The Emperor's First Grandson inheriting the throne
was a matter of course.

15:53.796 --> 15:57.475
I told you I would
consider it first.

16:02.436 --> 16:03.916
Go home first.

16:04.355 --> 16:06.115
You've been quite busy lately.

16:06.424 --> 16:07.983
Go home and rest.

16:08.305 --> 16:10.956
If there is no need,
do not enter the palace first.

16:15.956 --> 16:16.436
Good.

16:26.436 --> 16:27.076
Mrs,

16:28.115 --> 16:29.475
eat again

16:35.796 --> 16:36.676
Bibi Jin,

16:40.076 --> 16:42.036
is Sun Jing still alive?

16:53.235 --> 16:53.715
Mrs.

16:57.676 --> 16:58.115
Correct.

17:00.316 --> 17:01.595
Logically,

17:02.875 --> 17:04.396
I should be worried

17:06.836 --> 17:08.196
because of this big threat

17:09.876 --> 17:11.555
still not removed.

17:12.916 --> 17:14.596
However, when I remember

17:15.995 --> 17:18.356
how he rushed to the palace
covered in blood

17:19.676 --> 17:21.676
and hold my hand...

17:24.035 --> 17:26.075
What was I thinking at that time?

17:29.116 --> 17:31.075
I am the First Crown Princess.

17:33.515 --> 17:34.075
Mrs.

17:34.755 --> 17:36.995
During the days I spent
in the Crown Prince's Palace,

17:39.315 --> 17:40.555
I'm alive,

17:41.795 --> 17:43.795
but like an empty shell.

17:46.356 --> 17:48.876
Only when I'm with him,

17:50.755 --> 17:53.876
I feel like I really
am a human being.

17:56.396 --> 17:58.436
However, I am
the First Crown Princess.

18:01.356 --> 18:03.436
I'm not supposed to like it.

18:04.795 --> 18:05.515
Mrs.

18:07.035 --> 18:08.475
I know.

18:10.715 --> 18:12.235
I won't discuss it any more.

18:14.436 --> 18:16.035
No one will ever know

18:18.475 --> 18:20.275
the past between me and him,

18:23.275 --> 18:26.075
Nor will anyone else know
who I am now

18:29.836 --> 18:31.995
still love her.

18:45.116 --> 18:45.515
Mrs.

18:46.755 --> 18:47.315
Mrs.

18:57.916 --> 18:59.275
My relationship with Sun Jing

19:01.836 --> 19:03.755
insincere and full of hypocrisy.

19:06.876 --> 19:08.715
I've lost my reputation.

19:11.275 --> 19:13.356
It wouldn't be a pity if I died.

19:14.315 --> 19:15.075
Mrs,

19:16.315 --> 19:18.196
You can't say that.

19:23.396 --> 19:24.235
Stay cool,

19:27.876 --> 19:29.956
I won't die now.

19:35.956 --> 19:37.660
I still have to confirm
that the Emperor's First Grandson

19:37.676 --> 19:38.836
come back safely.

19:41.836 --> 19:42.995
I want to see it

19:44.795 --> 19:46.315
grow up well.

19:50.715 --> 19:51.956
At the time,

19:53.956 --> 19:58.075
I'll just be able to go to the afterlife

20:00.035 --> 20:02.196
to meet the Former Crown Prince.

20:07.156 --> 20:07.876
Mrs.

20:09.916 --> 20:10.876
Don't.

20:11.450 --> 20:14.458
(Residence of the King of Qin)

20:19.471 --> 20:24.339
(Legenda Jiang Ziya)

20:44.396 --> 20:45.876
Are you still willing to come visit me?

20:46.035 --> 20:48.795
I thought Big Miss Cui
had forgotten about me a long time ago.

20:48.995 --> 20:51.035
Why is His Highness the King of Qin
so forgetful?

20:51.196 --> 20:53.916
It was clearly His Majesty King Qin
who asked me to take care of Madam Xiao.

20:54.075 --> 20:56.715
Mrs. Xiao's health
has improved a lot today.

20:57.116 --> 20:59.235
He could already talk
after eating a bowl of porridge.

20:59.396 --> 21:01.436
So, I just had time to leave the palace
and visit you.

21:01.555 --> 21:04.315
I went straight to you
without having time to visit my father,

21:04.475 --> 21:06.974
but you don't appreciate it.
If that's the case, I'll just go.

21:07.035 --> 21:08.916
I want to go out of town
to meet my father.

21:09.284 --> 21:12.588
(Broad and Open Minded)
I'm just kidding.

21:12.836 --> 21:14.356
That's all, accompany me for a moment.

21:14.475 --> 21:15.935
Later I will go out of town with you

21:15.960 --> 21:17.596
to visit
Great General Cui. How?

21:17.755 --> 21:20.436
You're not afraid that my father
will tie you up again

21:20.555 --> 21:21.636
and put you in a box?

21:21.755 --> 21:23.356
You will definitely save me.

21:23.475 --> 21:24.715
That's not necessarily true.

21:27.315 --> 21:28.156
What's wrong with you?

21:28.475 --> 21:30.315
Is there anything that makes you
unhappy?

21:31.196 --> 21:33.196
Otherwise, why are you
lying here alone?

21:34.515 --> 21:36.876
No, I read books because I'm bored,

21:37.035 --> 21:39.356
then almost fell asleep
because he was so bored.

21:40.235 --> 21:42.715
I heard His Majesty opening
the palace treasury

21:42.956 --> 21:45.396
and use its contents to reward
all three teams.

21:45.715 --> 21:47.876
Logically speaking, you have made a great contribution,

21:48.116 --> 21:50.636
So the King of Qin's Residence
should have many guests.

21:50.876 --> 21:52.515
Why so quiet and lonely?

21:53.836 --> 21:55.356
I don't like those civil officials.

21:55.475 --> 21:58.916
After all, I am the King of Qin
who leads the Western Border Army.

21:59.035 --> 22:01.116
I am not free to make friends
with civil officials.

22:01.475 --> 22:02.755
If I were friends with the general,

22:02.770 --> 22:04.490
it will arouse suspicion
and be easily misunderstood.

22:04.715 --> 22:06.116
So, I thought

22:06.555 --> 22:07.755
to refuse guests.

22:08.079 --> 22:09.793
Civil and military officials
also know my nature

22:09.824 --> 22:11.315
so did not dare to come.

22:13.315 --> 22:14.475
It's okay if it's someone else.

22:14.636 --> 22:17.116
However, shouldn't you
visit Prime Minister Gu?

22:18.591 --> 22:21.715
During the day at the palace meeting,
the position of Prime Minister Gu was restored.

22:21.876 --> 22:23.995
His Majesty wanted to give him the title,

22:24.150 --> 22:26.350
but Prime Minister Gu knelt down
to thank him and refused.

22:26.755 --> 22:28.275
He is amazing.

22:28.836 --> 22:31.356
He also helped a lot
in reclaiming West Changjing.

22:32.396 --> 22:33.755
So, after the palace meeting that day,

22:33.900 --> 22:36.247
I went to Prime Minister Gu's Residence
and thanked him.

22:36.703 --> 22:38.582
You just visit
and thank you?

22:40.719 --> 22:44.207
Then... He didn't even want
a reward from His Majesty,

22:44.246 --> 22:45.596
what else can I do?

22:48.075 --> 22:52.795
Since you already went to the Gu Residence,
didn't you meet Gu Wanniang?

22:53.159 --> 22:56.620
(Broad and Open Minded)

22:57.916 --> 22:59.755
Why did I see Gu Wanniang?

23:01.315 --> 23:04.436
I don't care
why you met him.

23:10.156 --> 23:11.876
Ying, are you jealous?

23:12.676 --> 23:13.396
No.

23:13.596 --> 23:14.676
You're jealous.

23:14.876 --> 23:15.876
Absolutely not.

23:16.555 --> 23:18.636
I want to go out of town
to meet my father.

23:19.315 --> 23:21.475
I'm coming so you can rest easy.

23:22.916 --> 23:24.436
No need.

23:24.555 --> 23:25.475
Don't be jealous anymore.

23:33.409 --> 23:35.555
Ladies and Gentlemen,
please have a look and take your pick.

23:35.755 --> 23:37.356
Nuts in our shop

23:37.381 --> 23:39.778
dense, crunchy, and the delicious taste
lasts a long time in the mouth.

23:39.803 --> 23:41.196
You will definitely be satisfied.

23:41.210 --> 23:42.905
I want a pack of everything here .

23:43.164 --> 23:44.484
Please wait a moment.

23:44.509 --> 23:45.400
(Wollong)

23:45.425 --> 23:47.876
At that time you said in the letter
that after entering the capital,

23:47.930 --> 23:49.636
we have to come together
to this dried fruit shop.

23:49.725 --> 23:52.432
Today, it finally came true.

23:53.110 --> 23:55.995
I bought so much this time
it's enough for you to eat for a while.

23:57.475 --> 23:59.836
Why do you sound
a bit reluctant?

24:01.275 --> 24:02.636
I don't mind.

24:03.129 --> 24:05.916
I just thought who knows when
we will be able to meet again

24:06.035 --> 24:07.676
after parting today.

24:09.515 --> 24:11.995
Shiqi suddenly acted
childish.

24:12.082 --> 24:13.562
That was quite surprising.

24:15.335 --> 24:16.921
Initially, I wanted to buy
just a little.

24:17.200 --> 24:19.310
That way, you'll think of me
whenever it's over.

24:19.673 --> 24:22.432
However, I then thought
it would be a good idea to buy more.

24:22.681 --> 24:25.315
That way, you'll think of me
when you eat it. It is better.

24:26.536 --> 24:28.361
Who will think of you
when you eat dried fruit?

24:28.488 --> 24:29.000
Me.

24:30.035 --> 24:31.596
I will remember you
when I eat it.

24:32.356 --> 24:33.116
However,

24:33.275 --> 24:34.636
your favorite

24:35.127 --> 24:36.287
would also be my favorite.

24:40.795 --> 24:42.475
Sir, this is your dried fruit.

24:42.500 --> 24:42.995
Thank You.

24:46.574 --> 24:46.854
Ayo.

24:54.515 --> 24:57.676
Madam looks much better
and is also more stable when walking.

24:57.916 --> 25:00.356
Miss Taozi said,
as long as it is well maintained,

25:00.381 --> 25:02.062
Madam will be fine later.

25:04.836 --> 25:07.275
Commander He arrives!

25:13.316 --> 25:14.196
Mrs.

25:17.164 --> 25:19.911
Is Madam feeling
better today?

25:21.536 --> 25:22.576
It's much better.

25:24.116 --> 25:25.315
Come here and sit.

25:26.156 --> 25:26.995
Thank you Madam.

25:34.676 --> 25:36.715
Judging from the complexion of her face,
Madam was much better.

25:37.356 --> 25:39.995
Taozi told me
that Madam's body would be very weak

25:40.156 --> 25:41.396
after the poison is gone

25:41.916 --> 25:44.436
and need to consume snow ginseng
to improve health.

25:44.930 --> 25:46.156
I told King Qin about this.

25:46.457 --> 25:48.555
Then, King Qin chose some
good snow ginseng

25:48.956 --> 25:51.156
and asked me to take it to the palace
to give to Madame.

25:53.273 --> 25:54.753
Convey my thanks
to King Qin.

25:55.138 --> 25:56.378
Madam, there is no need to hesitate.

26:04.280 --> 26:05.359
Some time ago,

26:05.715 --> 26:09.035
I heard Miss say
that you are from the Cui Family Army.

26:10.116 --> 26:11.636
At the request of King Qin,

26:11.847 --> 26:13.960
You continue to stay in the palace
to look after me.

26:17.011 --> 26:18.771
I've really caused trouble for Miss.

26:20.035 --> 26:20.715
No.

26:21.156 --> 26:22.356
Madam is too shy.

26:22.555 --> 26:23.636
Talking about caring,

26:23.795 --> 26:26.275
Aunt Jin and the court ladies
did it.

26:26.436 --> 26:29.596
I just came here
and accompanied Madam to chat.

26:34.606 --> 26:37.636
Miss is King Qin's heartthrob, right?

26:46.692 --> 26:48.573
Despite never having met King Qin,

26:49.116 --> 26:51.196
I once sent
a secret letter to him

26:51.674 --> 26:53.113
in my most difficult situation.

26:54.156 --> 26:58.795
The character can be seen
from various details.

26:59.550 --> 27:01.870
I know he has no
female relatives in his residence.

27:02.335 --> 27:04.256
You must be his idol

27:04.995 --> 27:08.436
so that he can calmly
entrust me to you.

27:11.701 --> 27:13.461
Madam is truly very perceptive.

27:20.555 --> 27:21.755
I am a person

27:22.916 --> 27:24.436
unfaithful and immoral.

27:25.636 --> 27:26.836
Only death

27:27.436 --> 27:29.156
that could end my life.

27:30.956 --> 27:32.715
King Qin once promised me
that time

27:33.755 --> 27:35.836
he will help me find
the Emperor's First Grandson.

27:37.356 --> 27:38.676
I know King Qin

27:39.636 --> 27:41.916
is a person who keeps promises.

27:44.075 --> 27:46.116
My status is
as the Previous Crown Princess.

27:46.876 --> 27:50.795
Now in the palace, my situation
is very awkward and I don't feel free.

27:53.676 --> 27:55.156
I want to leave the palace,

27:55.876 --> 27:57.676
go to a remote place,

27:58.275 --> 27:59.995
and settle somewhere.

28:00.443 --> 28:02.804
Please Miss inform King Qin

28:04.275 --> 28:05.431
to grant my wish.

28:07.676 --> 28:08.676
Don't worry, madam.

28:09.356 --> 28:11.156
King Qin will definitely agree
to arrange it.

28:19.976 --> 28:21.496
Are you really surnamed He?

28:42.995 --> 28:44.396
Beautiful and appropriate.

28:44.941 --> 28:47.661
It turns out you are also talented
in flower arranging.

28:54.805 --> 28:56.404
King Qin came the other day.

28:56.734 --> 28:59.755
At first I wanted to ask you to come out
to meet him.

28:59.984 --> 29:02.555
However, after that I thought just forget it.

29:02.926 --> 29:06.515
Now is not the right time,
there will still be many opportunities in the future.

29:08.275 --> 29:08.916
Correct.

29:12.475 --> 29:14.075
After returning to the capital,

29:14.120 --> 29:15.596
His Majesty gave rewards
to all three teams.

29:15.876 --> 29:19.676
However, only King Qin
was not rewarded with anything.

29:19.956 --> 29:23.596
I think there must be bad people
on His Majesty's side.

29:23.995 --> 29:24.876
Most likely,

29:26.156 --> 29:27.836
He believed the slander
he heard.

29:28.916 --> 29:30.755
Things like this happen often.

29:30.920 --> 29:32.401
His merits were so great
that the Emperor felt threatened,

29:32.426 --> 29:33.660
don't know what to reward.

29:34.196 --> 29:37.196
Possibly, this is also something
that makes it difficult for His Majesty.

29:39.636 --> 29:40.836
Actually,

29:41.649 --> 29:44.568
the status of the King of Qin was already
the highest among the kings.

29:45.235 --> 29:49.396
However, King Qin was not rewarded
at all despite his great contribution

29:49.555 --> 29:53.116
by reclaiming the two capitals
and restoring the Yu Dynasty.

29:53.235 --> 29:54.956
That's ridiculous.

29:56.636 --> 29:59.396
Do you think Dad...

30:00.596 --> 30:02.515
He is in his prime

30:02.715 --> 30:05.515
and has no intention of appointing
a Crown Prince at this time.

30:05.676 --> 30:09.275
Otherwise,
the one appointed must be King Qin.

30:10.795 --> 30:12.436
However, King Xin is the eldest son

30:12.795 --> 30:15.396
and King Qi was
His Majesty's favorite son since childhood.

30:18.196 --> 30:21.636
Since ascending the throne,
His Majesty has not appointed a queen.

30:21.755 --> 30:24.436
The only son born to the empress
was a legitimate son.

30:25.515 --> 30:27.956
Tomorrow, I plan
to submit written suggestions,

30:28.116 --> 30:29.315
request His Majesty

30:29.370 --> 30:31.356
to bestow a posthumous title
on King Qin's biological mother.

30:31.636 --> 30:34.182
King Qin made such a great contribution,
that's as it should be

30:34.207 --> 30:36.331
his biological mother was given
the posthumous title of Empress.

30:38.555 --> 30:42.315
Reportedly, King Qin's biological mother
had a humble background.

30:43.515 --> 30:45.475
That is not important.

30:45.636 --> 30:48.396
She gave birth to King Qin,
such an extraordinary son.

30:48.555 --> 30:49.436
As his biological mother,

30:49.581 --> 30:52.075
didn't she deserve to be given
the posthumous title of Empress?

30:55.728 --> 30:57.485
(Istana Chaoqian)

30:57.596 --> 30:59.116
I've decided.

30:59.424 --> 31:02.103
Lady Dong, the biological mother of
King Xin and King Qi,

31:02.795 --> 31:05.075
given the posthumous title
of Empress of Zhaocheng.

31:06.235 --> 31:08.916
Lady Liu, King Qin's biological mother,

31:10.741 --> 31:12.741
given the posthumous title
of Consort Zhaoyi.

31:14.131 --> 31:15.572
- This...
- This...

31:16.075 --> 31:17.275
This is not correct.

31:19.795 --> 31:22.315
His Majesty, according to the servant this is not accurate.

31:24.342 --> 31:26.862
Servant agrees with Great General Pei.

31:26.931 --> 31:29.795
The posthumous title was given
because it was a gift from His Majesty

31:29.820 --> 31:31.916
and because of human ethical logic.

31:32.001 --> 31:34.196
After King Qin mobilized troops
from the Laolan Border,

31:34.246 --> 31:36.520
he crushed the rebellion
and retook two capitals.

31:36.606 --> 31:37.793
With such a large contribution,

31:37.818 --> 31:39.396
if his biological mother
had only been Concubine Zhaoyi,

31:39.421 --> 31:41.156
fear that it will be difficult to show
His Majesty's grace

31:41.181 --> 31:43.141
that shines in all directions.

31:43.755 --> 31:45.774
His Majesty, according to the servant,

31:46.116 --> 31:47.956
Mistress Liu gave birth to the King of Qin

31:48.116 --> 31:50.315
should have been given the posthumous title
of Empress.

31:51.396 --> 31:52.795
Servant agrees.

31:53.156 --> 31:54.636
Servant agrees.

31:54.836 --> 31:56.356
- Servant agrees.
- Servant agrees.

31:56.515 --> 31:58.116
All of you

31:58.275 --> 32:01.795
said that King Qin made a
great contribution to reclaiming the two capitals.

32:01.995 --> 32:03.075
What about the eastern capital?

32:05.567 --> 32:06.567
Do not be angry, Your Majesty.

32:06.916 --> 32:08.836
All because of the
useless Ananda.

32:08.861 --> 32:09.782
Shut up.

32:10.956 --> 32:13.196
Mrs. Liu had a humble background.

32:13.596 --> 32:16.356
Is it just because she is
King Qin's biological mother,

32:17.078 --> 32:19.477
should she be given the posthumous title
of Empress?

32:26.134 --> 32:29.275
His Majesty, regarding the slave's biological mother
from a simple background

32:29.796 --> 32:30.755
so that His Majesty does not like,

32:31.475 --> 32:34.035
request that the title of servant king be removed

32:34.631 --> 32:36.740
and send servants to Laolan Border
to guard the border.

32:37.475 --> 32:38.451
- This...
- This...

32:44.035 --> 32:47.156
You...

32:48.035 --> 32:49.396
Do not be angry, Your Majesty.

32:49.770 --> 32:51.515
As a child, it is appropriate

32:51.715 --> 32:54.836
King Qin was grateful to his biological mother
who had given birth to him.

32:54.995 --> 32:57.515
Please forgive the King of Qin.

32:59.831 --> 33:01.911
Get lost, get out of here!

33:02.555 --> 33:04.995
I don't want to see you
, this disobedient child again!

33:07.024 --> 33:07.864
Get out!

33:24.836 --> 33:26.715
He doesn't respect his father.

33:26.876 --> 33:29.075
He has no respect for his father!

33:44.448 --> 33:46.312
(A Virtuous Person Takes Great Responsibility)

33:46.396 --> 33:47.596
His Majesty's verbal command.

33:47.916 --> 33:50.035
Remembering that King Qin
had spoken harshly,

33:50.060 --> 33:52.755
insulted his father,
and made a fuss at the palace meeting,

33:52.956 --> 33:55.396
a special order was issued
to remove King Qin

33:55.555 --> 33:57.156
from his position
as chief military officer.

33:57.356 --> 34:00.229
He was ordered to introspect
at the Qin King's Residence.

34:00.230 --> 34:01.078
He must obey orders,

34:01.156 --> 34:02.755
can't leave
a single step from the house,

34:02.916 --> 34:04.555
cannot participate
in military affairs,

34:04.560 --> 34:06.490
and may not discuss
government affairs unilaterally.

34:06.596 --> 34:07.956
That's all.

34:10.916 --> 34:14.115
Servant, Li Ni,
is grateful for His Majesty's gift.

34:23.743 --> 34:28.219
(Calm and Focused

34:34.995 --> 34:38.756
When I was little,
my nanny aunt said,

34:39.515 --> 34:43.075
If I have a wish,
make a bamboo dragonfly.

34:44.756 --> 34:48.841
When he falls to the ground,
my wish will come true.

34:50.075 --> 34:52.356
At that time,
I really wanted to meet my mother.

34:52.675 --> 34:54.475
Everyone else has a mother,
only I don't have one.

34:55.716 --> 34:58.396
So, I folded
a lot of bamboo dragonflies.

34:58.872 --> 35:01.356
I climbed up the wall
and took them down one by one.

35:01.705 --> 35:02.426
Until

35:03.475 --> 35:05.675
everything was removed
then I knew

35:06.530 --> 35:08.290
that my nanny aunt
was just comforting me.

35:09.830 --> 35:11.230
No matter how much

42:24.555 --> 42:25.836
he will come to his senses sooner or later.

42:26.555 --> 42:29.756
The troops he sent towards Baiyue
were already on their way back.

42:29.770 --> 42:31.810
If those troops gathered
with Sun Jing at the Tong Border,

42:31.956 --> 42:32.916
that would be troublesome.

42:35.796 --> 42:36.396
Shiqi,

42:36.751 --> 42:37.475
so what do you mean?

42:37.890 --> 42:39.155
I've been pondering for the past few days.

42:39.956 --> 42:41.276
The best way is

42:41.916 --> 42:44.756
think of a way to get Grand General Pei
to send you to Changzhou.

42:47.030 --> 42:48.195
Here is Changzhou.

42:49.436 --> 42:50.356
Here is the Han River.

42:51.956 --> 42:53.595
From south to north,

42:54.316 --> 42:54.876
here

42:55.901 --> 42:59.716
is the best place to intercept
and kill the Baiyue expeditionary army.

43:00.436 --> 43:00.995
Stay cool,

43:01.555 --> 43:03.956
My father and I will definitely
sort this out.

43:05.838 --> 43:07.276
There is one more thing that needs your help.

43:08.756 --> 43:11.316
I will go to any lengths
to deal with your problems.

43:11.924 --> 43:12.964
No need to run into danger.

43:13.716 --> 43:15.276
You just have to help me with this.

43:16.316 --> 43:16.796
Stay cool.

43:45.195 --> 43:47.876
Is there a verbal message from King Qin?

43:50.080 --> 43:51.620
Then, thank you
for delivering the letter.

43:51.991 --> 43:53.951
Would Commander He
not read it?

44:00.515 --> 44:02.035
It turned out to be Young General Pei

44:02.276 --> 44:04.396
who came in person
to deliver King Qin's letter.

44:05.035 --> 44:07.515
Please deliver this letter
to Commander He.

44:07.956 --> 44:10.916
No, you also know
that she is now Miss Cui.

44:11.635 --> 44:14.035
He was outside Luoyang City,
at the Cui Family Army headquarters.

44:16.555 --> 44:17.316
Shiqi,

44:17.836 --> 44:20.356
You have important things to discuss
with the Cui Family Army

44:20.555 --> 44:22.916
Or have you found a way
to retake the eastern capital?

44:23.546 --> 44:24.436
Not both.

44:24.756 --> 44:25.675
This is a personal thing.

44:27.170 --> 44:28.830
Despite this enormous Qin King's Residence

44:28.930 --> 44:30.740
was surrounded by the Yulin Team
very tightly

44:30.756 --> 44:31.916
by order of His Majesty,

44:32.035 --> 44:34.488
I can't believe you couldn't
find anyone to deliver the mail.

44:34.513 --> 44:35.316
What about Erduo?

44:36.595 --> 44:38.829
You may not know that now
the Yulin Army is commanded

44:38.830 --> 44:41.010
to give tasks to
the people in the residence every day.

44:41.075 --> 44:42.316
No matter how great Erduo is,

44:42.876 --> 44:45.195
he wouldn't be able to go
and come home in a day.

44:46.475 --> 44:49.709
Shiqi,
I told you the Cui Family now...

44:49.710 --> 44:51.820
Who said earlier that he was willing
to go through danger without hesitation?

44:52.035 --> 44:53.310
You changed your mind so quickly?

44:59.436 --> 45:01.356
Also this box.
This is a newly purchased snack.

45:01.356 --> 45:02.995
You deliver it, this is his favorite food.

45:03.916 --> 45:04.396
Hurry up.

45:04.698 --> 45:06.268
(Tang Cake Shop)

45:06.396 --> 45:08.796
Shiqi is now locked up at home,

45:09.184 --> 45:11.475
but he always remembers
to write you a letter.

45:12.316 --> 45:14.356
You really won't
read that letter?

45:17.555 --> 45:19.075
Don't worry, Young General Pei.

45:19.916 --> 45:22.356
Even if all the bad people
in this world perish,

45:22.475 --> 45:24.675
King Qin will definitely be fine.

45:25.555 --> 45:28.595
His Majesty saved your life many times
despite the risks,

45:28.675 --> 45:30.276
but you don't care at all.

45:30.655 --> 45:31.255
It seems,

45:31.956 --> 45:33.876
you really have a heart of stone.

45:36.693 --> 45:38.373
The King of Qin did a great job this time.

45:39.115 --> 45:42.555
If he remains in government,
what reward can His Majesty give?

45:42.641 --> 45:44.635
If His Majesty does not reward him,

45:44.756 --> 45:47.995
whether his two older brothers, King Qin
and officials in the government

45:48.716 --> 45:49.995
will be afraid?

45:50.555 --> 45:52.236
The King of Qin left angrily
and was locked up.

45:52.396 --> 45:54.796
On the surface,
his military powers appeared to be revoked.

45:55.356 --> 45:56.236
But actually,

45:56.790 --> 45:58.910
had he really lost
the Western Border Army?

45:59.570 --> 46:01.930
Young General Pei is also the one
who leads the army to war,

46:02.155 --> 46:05.236
should know when to attack,
when to camp and rest,

46:05.836 --> 46:07.155
the principle is the same.

46:10.276 --> 46:10.956
It's late.

46:11.075 --> 46:14.195
Young General Pei was not free
to remain in the Cui Family Army.

46:14.450 --> 46:15.515
I won't take you.

46:18.075 --> 46:18.916
Until found.

46:28.595 --> 46:30.675
It wasn't Erduo who delivered the letter.

46:30.995 --> 46:32.475
Some are very disappointed, right?

46:34.035 --> 46:35.956
No.

46:36.316 --> 46:36.995
No.

46:38.870 --> 46:40.515
You must be hungry
at this time of night, right?

46:40.836 --> 46:43.276
Eat freshly delivered snacks.

46:44.796 --> 46:46.995
You're the best.
I'm a little hungry.

46:47.020 --> 46:47.876
Eat it.

46:54.220 --> 46:56.600
Commander, this snack
is not too sweet and will make you feel bad,

46:56.606 --> 46:57.565
really very delicious.

47:03.236 --> 47:05.716
You really won't
read that letter?

47:07.320 --> 47:08.710
How about you read it?

47:09.064 --> 47:10.439
(Tang Cake Shop)

47:22.035 --> 47:24.115
Why is there only blank paper?

47:26.902 --> 47:29.422
Commander, you expected that, didn't you?

47:30.014 --> 47:31.175
What does this mean?

47:32.719 --> 47:35.159
Li Ni asks Pei Yuan
to deliver the letter.

47:36.105 --> 47:38.745
That means even though he is locked up,

47:39.223 --> 47:40.710
there were still people he could use.

47:41.108 --> 47:44.515
Apart from that, the Western Border Army
also continued to listen to his orders.

47:45.756 --> 47:47.115
Anything else doesn't matter.

47:47.446 --> 47:48.846
Why waste ink?

47:50.916 --> 47:55.396
You two smart people
always go back and forth like this,

47:55.756 --> 47:56.995
aren't you tired?

47:57.091 --> 47:58.091
Correct.

47:58.236 --> 48:01.075
Unlike certain people
who just need to blow the whistle,

48:01.155 --> 48:04.075
then Erduo will immediately
rush over.
