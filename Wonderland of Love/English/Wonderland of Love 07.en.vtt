01:59.420 --> 02:00.970
- Lieutenant.
- What is the situation?

02:01.120 --> 02:02.900
The Bingzhou garrison
is about to collapse.

02:02.919 --> 02:04.520
Some soldiers left the city
and escaped to Jianzhou.

02:04.520 --> 02:05.820
The rest have mostly given up.

02:05.820 --> 02:08.320
Now we count the prisoners,
food supplies, stamps, letters

02:08.320 --> 02:09.480
and many other urgent things.

02:09.520 --> 02:10.559
Did you touch Han Li?

02:10.560 --> 02:11.700
When Han Li saw the situation,

02:11.700 --> 02:13.520
He escaped with the help
of his personal guards.

02:13.520 --> 02:15.319
But I have sent our men
to look for him.

02:15.730 --> 02:16.670
The city gate is closed.

02:16.680 --> 02:18.039
I'm sure he's still in Bingzhou.

02:19.039 --> 02:19.520
Listen.

02:19.759 --> 02:21.999
We have to capture Han Li
before the Zhenxi Army.

02:22.400 --> 02:22.839
See that.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.556
(Which)

02:32.920 --> 02:33.640
Guards!

02:34.159 --> 02:34.920
Guards!

02:35.680 --> 02:36.159
Mr. Lv.

02:37.439 --> 02:38.900
Mr. Lv fainted suddenly.

02:39.360 --> 02:39.999
Mr. Lv.

02:46.620 --> 02:47.400
Alú escapes!

02:59.039 --> 02:59.640
Señor Shiqi.

03:00.020 --> 03:01.319
This time I have brought many men.

03:03.039 --> 03:03.640
Where is Han Li?

03:03.730 --> 03:04.510
Have you caught it?

03:04.720 --> 03:06.080
I made a deal with the Cui family.

03:06.200 --> 03:08.370
Whoever catches Han Li first
will take over Bingzhou.

03:08.520 --> 03:10.420
Han Li fled
as soon as the battle began.

03:11.020 --> 03:12.170
But Bao chases after him.

03:12.480 --> 03:13.999
Let's go capture that cunning man.

03:20.680 --> 03:21.240
Chen Xing.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.879
Lieutenant,
Han Li is not in the car.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.080
In fact it is clever.

03:42.920 --> 03:44.800
Qiucui, don't worry.

03:45.319 --> 03:46.200
Our servants

03:46.279 --> 03:47.680
They are on guard below.

03:48.080 --> 03:49.520
Nobody can enter.

03:51.319 --> 03:53.220
Lady, they say

03:53.220 --> 03:55.220
that the army will break into the city
and sack it

03:55.240 --> 03:56.240
and do all kinds of evil.

03:56.360 --> 03:58.240
Will our servants be able to stop them?

03:58.640 --> 03:59.839
If they can stop them,

03:59.960 --> 04:01.599
We will be safe and healthy.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.400
If they don't stop them,

04:03.599 --> 04:05.960
What's the point
of being afraid right now?

04:06.999 --> 04:08.240
This is the Third Lady's fault.

04:08.360 --> 04:09.839
If he does not curse you with the Master,

04:09.960 --> 04:11.749
You wouldn't have to volunteer to come.

04:11.750 --> 04:13.260
to Bingzhou
for ancestor worship.

04:13.279 --> 04:14.800
If it weren't for the Third Lady,

04:14.879 --> 04:16.639
we wouldn't be here in Bingzhou

04:16.840 --> 04:19.275
(Prime Minister Gu's daughter,)
and we wouldn't be in danger now.

04:19.480 --> 04:21.720
(Gu Wan'niang)
Qiucui, that's not true.

04:22.439 --> 04:23.639
The third sister is right.

04:24.079 --> 04:25.840
My father has six daughters.

04:26.280 --> 04:29.280
I'm the only one who isn't smart

04:29.520 --> 04:30.800
and has no rescue qualities.

04:31.360 --> 04:32.840
If I don't work harder,

04:32.959 --> 04:34.840
I will be even more useless.

04:35.079 --> 04:36.639
Third Lady
was simply spouting nonsense.

04:36.759 --> 04:38.879
Don't take it personally.

04:40.879 --> 04:43.319
Great Governor Sun wanted to appoint
my father as prime minister.

04:43.680 --> 04:44.999
My father refused.

04:45.079 --> 04:46.720
Then, he was sent to jail.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.600
All royal families
in the capital city

04:48.720 --> 04:50.999
He admired him
for his incorruptible integrity.

04:51.840 --> 04:54.160
Now that he's finally free,

04:54.320 --> 04:55.810
You cannot leave the capital city.

04:56.680 --> 04:57.840
I am lucky to be able

04:57.850 --> 04:59.260
travel to Bingzhou to pay tribute

04:59.380 --> 05:00.720
to our ancestors in his name.

05:01.519 --> 05:02.639
If you are always like this,

05:02.879 --> 05:05.040
When can you live
with your head held high?

05:05.519 --> 05:07.360
Even those servants in the residence

05:07.480 --> 05:09.079
They dare to treat you rudely now.

05:19.210 --> 05:20.040
Don't worry, Master.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.870
Persecutors have been fooled
with that car.

05:25.439 --> 05:28.959
Is there somewhere to hide here?

05:32.450 --> 05:34.399
If you can seize
someone's private residence

05:34.519 --> 05:35.360
in broad daylight,

05:35.820 --> 05:37.710
Why don't you look
to hide?

05:38.999 --> 05:40.280
Mr. Han has always been a hero.

05:41.199 --> 05:41.920
Miss.

05:42.120 --> 05:44.079
But now, you are hiding
in a lady's room.

05:44.720 --> 05:45.639
Gives you no shame?

05:45.920 --> 05:46.519
Mr. Han.

05:47.079 --> 05:48.559
Don't you think you've fallen too low

05:48.720 --> 05:50.110
If you have to keep a weak lady kidnapped?

05:50.519 --> 05:52.160
You can't hit me.

05:52.480 --> 05:54.600
Since you are young master Cui
study partner,

05:54.920 --> 05:56.399
Now that Bingzhou has fallen,

05:56.519 --> 05:58.000
the Zhenxi Army has more power.

05:58.199 --> 06:00.840
Since you don't value
Young Master Cui,

06:01.079 --> 06:03.079
Maybe you should join
the Zhenxi Army instead.

06:03.280 --> 06:03.999
You are already

06:04.160 --> 06:05.480
in such a difficult situation.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.280
And yet,
you're worried about my future.

06:07.519 --> 06:08.519
I will never regret

06:08.639 --> 06:09.480
know you.

06:09.639 --> 06:10.319
And thanks

06:10.439 --> 06:12.360
for putting me in your good graces.

06:13.160 --> 06:16.879
What's the point of putting you
in my good graces?

06:17.240 --> 06:20.480
Will you let me go?

06:21.210 --> 06:22.510
You have misunderstood me, Lord Han.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.280
I can not thank you enough.

06:24.439 --> 06:25.559
Why would it bring you harm?

06:26.160 --> 06:27.519
Everyone in town says

06:27.680 --> 06:28.959
that you are good at business.

06:29.320 --> 06:30.559
And that you are a rich man.

06:30.720 --> 06:32.390
Now that I have been abandoned
by the Cui family,

06:32.399 --> 06:33.360
I don't have anything.

06:33.999 --> 06:35.999
Please be understanding

06:36.600 --> 06:38.040
and give me a hand.

06:40.800 --> 06:41.519
Take them.

06:47.600 --> 06:50.079
These pieces of jewelry
are very valuable.

06:50.480 --> 06:51.840
take them

06:51.999 --> 06:53.519
and join the Zhenxi Army.

07:07.920 --> 07:08.439
Miss!

07:08.559 --> 07:09.199
Do not stay!

07:09.559 --> 07:09.840
Miss.

07:09.920 --> 07:11.160
If she comes here, I will kill her.

07:11.199 --> 07:11.879
Miss.

07:12.559 --> 07:13.600
Miss!

07:15.680 --> 07:16.519
Miss.

07:35.480 --> 07:36.920
Miss, please forgive me.

07:39.399 --> 07:40.639
Thanks for saving my life.

07:42.800 --> 07:43.439
Do not move!

07:47.800 --> 07:49.600
Lieutenant,
should we fight them for him?

07:51.360 --> 07:52.360
I recognize defeat.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.600
I'm not anyone
who can't admit defeat.

07:55.439 --> 07:56.480
Are you okay, miss?

07:56.600 --> 07:57.240
Miss.

07:57.360 --> 07:57.999
Hurry up.

07:58.360 --> 07:58.959
Come here.

07:59.840 --> 08:00.519
Señor Shiqi.

08:00.520 --> 08:02.420
Finally, we managed
to capture this cunning man.

08:06.399 --> 08:07.959
It's too late for the Cui Army.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.680
Now Han Li belongs to us.

08:09.879 --> 08:11.040
Congratulations, Li Ni.

08:11.720 --> 08:13.840
Since you have managed to capture Han Li,

08:14.160 --> 08:16.840
I will honor our deal.

08:17.439 --> 08:20.319
Bingzhou belongs to the Zhenxi Army now.

08:24.559 --> 08:25.480
Gracias.

08:35.120 --> 08:36.770
Han Li has been captured
by the Zhenxi Army.

08:36.770 --> 08:39.240
According to our deal,
bingzhou belongs to them now.

08:39.360 --> 08:40.039
That?

08:40.500 --> 08:41.560
When did they make that deal?

08:41.679 --> 08:42.639
with the Zhenxi army?

08:42.759 --> 08:43.679
How will you be able to do it?

08:44.080 --> 08:45.960
Lieutenant,
why didn't you tell me?

08:46.020 --> 08:47.799
She already informed me
about it beforehand.

08:48.519 --> 08:49.919
She barely followed my order.

08:52.799 --> 08:54.440
The Zhenxi Army is short on food.

08:54.560 --> 08:55.279
Of

08:55.399 --> 08:56.840
informed Young Master about it.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.360
As soon as we entered the city,

08:58.410 --> 09:00.300
We sent our men to clean up
the food supplies.

09:00.600 --> 09:03.320
Now, although the Zhenxi army
has taken over Bingzhou,

09:03.639 --> 09:05.159
They still don't have food.

09:06.560 --> 09:07.840
I see.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.560
I would like to ask you
please, Li.

09:13.039 --> 09:15.039
Are you finally going
to let yourself help?

09:15.879 --> 09:16.840
We are Family.

09:16.850 --> 09:17.880
There is no need to be polite.

09:17.960 --> 09:19.320
You are the commander of our army.

09:19.340 --> 09:20.279
Just give me your order.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.120
Now that our army is in the city,

09:22.270 --> 09:24.080
We have to remain alert
in case the Zhenxi Army

09:24.519 --> 09:25.440
He has an ulterior motive.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.440
I hope you can

09:27.520 --> 09:28.890
stationing a troop
outside the city.

09:29.039 --> 09:30.519
If something happens in the city,

09:30.720 --> 09:32.519
You can support us from outside.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.080
Just in case.

09:37.120 --> 09:37.560
Season...

09:38.320 --> 09:39.440
Contribute a troop outside?

09:41.879 --> 09:43.919
I'm sure you have a reason
for this decision.

09:44.020 --> 09:46.110
I will lead one troop and one station
out of the city at a time.

09:47.440 --> 09:48.200
Gracias.

09:49.720 --> 09:50.759
We are Family.

09:50.860 --> 09:52.010
There is no need to be polite.

09:59.200 --> 10:00.560
I know you don't like it.

10:00.840 --> 10:01.519
That's why

10:01.799 --> 10:03.480
I sent him away from the city.

10:04.080 --> 10:05.200
Thank you, Young Master.

10:05.360 --> 10:07.080
No wonder Shu is nowhere to be found.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.560
You sent him outside the city
early in the morning

10:09.679 --> 10:10.679
to keep an eye on Cui Li.

10:10.799 --> 10:12.759
You know me well, Ying.

10:13.220 --> 10:13.820
Have some tea.

10:14.360 --> 10:15.320
Let me pour it out for you.

10:25.360 --> 10:26.879
Say it again if you dare.

10:27.360 --> 10:27.960
GOOD.

10:28.560 --> 10:30.879
Since you are slightly deaf,
I will say it again.

10:31.519 --> 10:32.679
The Cui Army

10:32.960 --> 10:33.720
must deliver

10:33.799 --> 10:35.240
the foods you have eaten

10:35.360 --> 10:36.879
and leave the city.

10:37.879 --> 10:39.200
The Zhenxi Army

10:39.480 --> 10:41.919
He is magnanimous and kind.

10:42.080 --> 10:42.879
Since we are both

10:43.039 --> 10:44.799
They are fighting for the same throne,

10:44.919 --> 10:46.720
we will let you rest in Bingzhou

10:46.879 --> 10:48.679
for one night before your departure.

10:48.710 --> 10:49.480
What do you think?

10:49.600 --> 10:52.200
The Zhenxi army
is generous enough, right?

10:52.879 --> 10:54.440
We are the ones who took down Bingzhou.

10:54.450 --> 10:56.390
The food supplies belong
to the party that entered the city first.

10:56.399 --> 10:58.039
Even though we made a deal with you,

10:58.120 --> 10:59.440
now you have taken over Bingzhou.

10:59.580 --> 11:01.420
Why do we have to
give you food supplies?

11:02.080 --> 11:03.600
Do you think I'll be afraid of you

11:03.720 --> 11:05.320
just because you slapped the table?

11:05.840 --> 11:08.759
We went down Bingzhou together.

11:08.879 --> 11:10.159
Without the Zhenxi Army,

11:10.320 --> 11:11.840
Han Li would have escaped to Jianzhou

11:11.960 --> 11:13.200
and tried to reclaim Bingzhou.

11:13.320 --> 11:14.200
How dare you say that.

11:14.279 --> 11:15.039
I said!

11:15.120 --> 11:16.310
Give back our food supplies!

11:16.320 --> 11:17.279
Say it again!

11:17.399 --> 11:19.039
Are you really deaf?

11:19.120 --> 11:20.250
If we don't attack the city,

11:20.260 --> 11:21.720
you wouldn't have time
to catch Han Li.

11:21.720 --> 11:22.679
Return our food supplies

11:22.840 --> 11:24.080
and get out of Bingzhou!

11:32.840 --> 11:33.320
Divina.

11:33.399 --> 11:34.240
Bro.

11:34.399 --> 11:35.480
I'll kill you.

11:35.600 --> 11:36.320
I'll kill you.

11:36.330 --> 11:37.520
Han Li does not have the tiger bead.

11:37.820 --> 11:38.770
Keep searching.

11:39.039 --> 11:39.560
Roger that.

11:40.440 --> 11:41.799
- That's complete nonsense.
- Bright.

11:41.919 --> 11:43.919
I'll kill you.

11:44.440 --> 11:45.519
They are looking for

11:45.639 --> 11:47.080
Han Li's residence completely.

11:51.399 --> 11:52.039
It seems that

11:52.879 --> 11:54.440
the tiger account is not with Han Li.

11:56.600 --> 11:57.960
Young Master Cui there

11:57.980 --> 11:59.720
has a fierce reputation
on the battlefield.

11:59.770 --> 12:01.200
But now that I've seen it in person,

12:01.360 --> 12:03.120
He is just a weak and weak man.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.420
Never judge a book by its cover.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.799
He's just a cute boy.

12:07.820 --> 12:09.679
How dare you say
I didn't join the fight.

12:09.799 --> 12:11.080
You were just a baby

12:11.200 --> 12:12.480
when I was fighting in battle!

12:12.600 --> 12:14.200
We will fight if they dare!

12:14.410 --> 12:15.320
- Let's go then!
- Come on!

12:15.720 --> 12:17.070
I'm not a coward who's afraid of you.

12:17.200 --> 12:17.639
Ven.

12:17.720 --> 12:18.999
I'm going to teach you a lesson,

12:19.080 --> 12:20.159
brother

12:20.166 --> 12:20.999
(Tang problem)

12:24.210 --> 12:24.799
Are you hungry?

12:25.320 --> 12:27.110
I asked someone
early in the morning.

12:27.279 --> 12:28.399
They are your favorites.

12:29.420 --> 12:30.360
Thank you, Young Master.

12:37.200 --> 12:38.480
You are quite strong.

12:43.120 --> 12:43.720
It's delicious.

12:44.919 --> 12:45.879
Where are you hitting?

12:45.960 --> 12:46.320
Yo...

12:47.480 --> 12:48.440
Let me help you clean.

12:49.519 --> 12:50.120
¡Detente!

12:58.279 --> 12:58.919
I'm hungry.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.110
Let's eat first.

13:00.600 --> 13:01.320
¿Comer?

13:01.999 --> 13:02.960
I'm not hungry.

13:04.279 --> 13:05.360
I say I'm hungry.

13:31.480 --> 13:32.200
Lieutenant.

13:32.759 --> 13:34.480
It seems that Li Ni found

13:34.600 --> 13:36.080
the pivot you have lost.

13:37.080 --> 13:38.080
I never thought

13:38.240 --> 13:39.200
that Imperial grandfather,

13:39.360 --> 13:40.600
the marshal of the Zhenxi Army,

13:40.799 --> 13:42.080
I would be so greedy.

13:42.120 --> 13:43.620
He found your nail
but refused to come back.

13:43.720 --> 13:45.720
And he even wears it openly in his head.

13:45.919 --> 13:46.960
How shameless of him.

13:47.320 --> 13:48.420
I'll go get it for you.

13:48.799 --> 13:49.159
No.

13:49.960 --> 13:50.840
Don't make trouble.

13:51.420 --> 13:52.370
Look at the big picture.

13:58.679 --> 13:59.600
I thought that the lieutenant

13:59.720 --> 14:00.799
lost its pivot.

14:02.560 --> 14:04.200
Why does Li Ni have it?

14:05.399 --> 14:08.320
Lieutenant He gave it to you.

14:11.420 --> 14:12.420
Qixi Lantern Festival

14:12.430 --> 14:14.470
It has always been an important festival
in Bingzhou.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.440
Now, we have
two large armies in Bingzhou.

14:16.840 --> 14:17.919
Who do you think

14:18.080 --> 14:19.999
Will you accept our invitation?

14:20.879 --> 14:22.720
I hope there is no fight.

14:23.120 --> 14:24.519
Ask that pretty face of yours

14:24.600 --> 14:25.440
to go out.

14:25.560 --> 14:26.440
Who is a pretty face?

14:26.759 --> 14:29.320
The Zhenxi Army is the pretty face
that wants a free ride.

14:29.440 --> 14:31.039
Both armies fight a lot.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.480
A fight will eventually break out.

14:32.840 --> 14:34.159
If the city cannot be at peace,

14:34.360 --> 14:36.120
It is we
who will be affected.

14:37.279 --> 14:38.240
I'm sorry for the wait.

14:38.639 --> 14:39.759
No need to apologize.

14:39.960 --> 14:41.159
According to our Young Master,

14:41.270 --> 14:42.910
Bingzhou has just begun
to settle down.

14:43.080 --> 14:44.360
Everyone continues to live in fear.

14:44.410 --> 14:46.560
We need to hold a lively
Lantern Festival celebration.

14:47.440 --> 14:48.519
Life can only go on

14:48.759 --> 14:50.039
when people feel safe.

14:50.170 --> 14:51.440
And bring peace to the people

14:51.560 --> 14:53.240
That's why we fight for the throne.

14:53.799 --> 14:56.080
Everyone in the Cui army,

14:56.140 --> 14:58.100
including the Young Master,
will attend the festival.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.399
Please take care of us on that day

15:01.279 --> 15:01.879
Of course.

15:04.879 --> 15:05.679
It seems that

15:05.840 --> 15:07.720
the Zhenxi army
is not attending.

15:08.440 --> 15:09.639
No, that's not true.

15:09.879 --> 15:11.399
Young Master Cui has said everything

15:11.519 --> 15:12.440
that my general transmits.

15:13.039 --> 15:14.840
The Zhenxi army
will attend the festival as well.

15:15.820 --> 15:16.279
Gracias.

15:16.440 --> 15:16.919
Gracias.

15:19.080 --> 15:20.919
What's the point of having good hearing?

15:21.320 --> 15:22.639
You speak so slowly,

15:36.639 --> 15:38.200
Why are you here, Imperial Grandfather?

15:38.620 --> 15:40.320
I need to ask the lieutenant something .

15:40.759 --> 15:42.159
She's just a lieutenant.

15:42.420 --> 15:43.620
If it concerns military matters,

15:44.279 --> 15:46.159
You can only talk to me about it.

15:46.679 --> 15:47.519
It's a minor matter.

15:47.919 --> 15:49.279
No need to bother you.

15:51.919 --> 15:53.080
I heard that Lieutenant He

15:53.480 --> 15:55.279
He was stranded in Han Li's residence
a few days ago.

15:55.519 --> 15:57.519
And she only came out alive

15:57.999 --> 15:59.560
because I was under your care.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.240
I should prepare a banquet

16:02.999 --> 16:05.279
to thank

16:05.480 --> 16:06.840
for your help.

16:07.620 --> 16:09.870
The Cui Army is the main army
fighting for the throne.

16:09.920 --> 16:10.470
It is my duty.

16:10.480 --> 16:11.080
You are too kind.

16:11.679 --> 16:12.440
I grew up

16:12.560 --> 16:13.799
with Lieutenant Him since he was young.

16:14.039 --> 16:15.639
We have a special relationship.

16:16.120 --> 16:18.159
So, taking care of the lieutenant,

16:18.720 --> 16:20.560
you have taken care of me too.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.159
I knew you would come.

16:31.159 --> 16:32.360
Why are you here, Young Master?

16:33.360 --> 16:35.679
I just want to visit you.

16:38.960 --> 16:40.080
Greetings, Your Majesty.

16:40.480 --> 16:41.240
You may be calm

16:42.159 --> 16:43.399
It was urgent today.

16:43.679 --> 16:44.840
You're not hurt, are you?

16:45.120 --> 16:46.600
Is a doctor needed?

16:46.759 --> 16:48.840
Right now, General Pei Yuan

16:48.860 --> 16:50.620
He has already sent a doctor
to see me.

16:50.799 --> 16:53.279
Fortunately, I only have some minor cuts.

16:53.440 --> 16:54.200
Nothing serious.

16:54.639 --> 16:56.799
I'm here to thank you.

16:57.159 --> 16:58.720
If it weren't for you today,

16:58.879 --> 17:00.679
I would have died.

17:01.480 --> 17:02.279
There's no need.

17:02.759 --> 17:03.799
It is not a big thing.

17:04.840 --> 17:06.280
Do not address me as Your Highness.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.080
Call me with my title in the army.

17:09.800 --> 17:10.520
Ven.

17:17.120 --> 17:18.320
The weather has turned cold.

17:18.330 --> 17:20.120
And you're not dressed properly
because of the cold.

17:20.130 --> 17:21.220
No wonder you cough.

17:21.520 --> 17:22.719
If Taozi discovers this,

17:22.879 --> 17:24.239
She will teach you again.

17:25.399 --> 17:25.959
I'm fine.

17:26.719 --> 17:31.000
Today, after keeping a close eye on Li Ni,

17:31.159 --> 17:34.600
In fact, he is an outstanding commander
as you said.

17:35.420 --> 17:36.770
We should never underestimate it.

17:40.639 --> 17:42.280
Indeed, Li Ni is a wise strategist.

17:42.760 --> 17:44.360
The Zhenxi Army is a formidable force.

17:44.679 --> 17:46.399
If we can fight together,

17:46.620 --> 17:48.420
We can achieve victory
with half the effort.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.479
But if we become enemies,

17:52.239 --> 17:53.120
to be honest,

17:53.439 --> 17:55.239
with an opponent like Li Ni,

17:56.080 --> 17:57.000
I fear that

17:57.159 --> 17:58.640
that we will not be able to defeat them.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.520
The Zhenxi Army is tied up
fighting for the throne.

18:03.080 --> 18:04.120
It does not matter that,

18:05.199 --> 18:06.679
They will not become our enemies.

18:07.399 --> 18:09.919
It's better to be safe than sorry.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.719
Do you have any family in this city?

18:13.040 --> 18:14.959
I can ask Bao to send someone
to take you home.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.399
I haven't introduced myself yet.

18:17.800 --> 18:18.879
My last name is Gu.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.080
Called Wan 'niang.

18:20.199 --> 18:21.719
I am from the capital city.

18:22.040 --> 18:23.639
Last month, I came to Bingzhou

18:23.660 --> 18:25.800
to pay tribute to my ancestors
in the name of my father.

18:26.560 --> 18:27.630
La familia Gu en Bingzhou.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.300
I remember that Prime Minister Gu

18:31.399 --> 18:33.080
It belongs to the Gu family in Bingzhou as well.

18:33.620 --> 18:36.239
I heard that he called Sun Jing out
for being a traitor in court.

18:36.760 --> 18:37.959
So, they sent him to jail.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.520
He is my father.

18:42.479 --> 18:44.879
In the end, to gain
the support of the people,

18:45.000 --> 18:46.719
my father was released from prison

18:46.879 --> 18:48.080
and confined at home.

18:48.479 --> 18:51.159
So I traveled to Bingzhou
to pay homage to our ancestors

18:51.320 --> 18:52.840
and pray for my father.

18:54.760 --> 18:56.399
So, you are
Prime Minister Gu's daughter.

18:57.120 --> 18:58.639
Our country was overthrown

18:58.800 --> 19:00.479
and my father almost lost his life.

19:01.239 --> 19:03.439
Fortunately, I ran into
the Zhenxi army today.

19:03.600 --> 19:04.879
And our army is really impressive

19:05.040 --> 19:06.159
y formidable.

19:06.719 --> 19:10.080
I am willing to donate our family's food
eaten in Bingzhou to the Zhenxi Army.

19:10.280 --> 19:11.800
May victory be yours

19:11.959 --> 19:13.399
and claim
the capital city soon.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.110
That way, you can not only
save people from this danger,

19:16.600 --> 19:18.199
You can save my father too.

19:19.760 --> 19:21.000
Prime Minister Gu is loyal

19:21.239 --> 19:23.239
and now, you are donating
the food for our army.

19:23.520 --> 19:25.110
You are indeed the offspring
of loyal family.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.000
I have a favor to ask.

19:28.239 --> 19:29.919
I hope you can give me a hand.

19:31.919 --> 19:33.159
Forward.

19:34.560 --> 19:36.000
Now the nation is in chaos.

19:36.120 --> 19:37.940
And Bingzhou is far
from the capital city.

19:37.959 --> 19:40.310
I'm afraid I won't be able
to return to the capital city alone.

19:40.320 --> 19:41.239
Please agree

19:41.399 --> 19:42.840
let me travel with the army.

19:43.130 --> 19:44.870
That way, I will be lucky
enough to witness

19:44.879 --> 19:46.919
the claim of Xichang
by the Zhenxi Army.

19:48.280 --> 19:50.040
It is not easy to march with the army.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.000
It is not advisable
to bring ladies with us.

19:52.479 --> 19:54.000
No matter how difficult it is,

19:54.120 --> 19:55.560
I can accept it.

19:55.840 --> 19:57.040
If you are worried about us,

19:57.159 --> 19:58.600
Qiucui and I can dress like men.

19:58.719 --> 20:00.239
We won't cause you any problems.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.360
It's better for me to send a team

20:04.520 --> 20:05.840
to accompany you back to the capital city.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.239
You are busy with military matters.

20:07.320 --> 20:09.719
I don't want you to lower
the size of your army to protect yourself.

20:09.879 --> 20:11.199
I just need to allow myself

20:11.360 --> 20:13.199
follow the army from behind.

20:23.760 --> 20:24.439
Okay then.

20:25.199 --> 20:26.360
You can dress like a man

20:26.879 --> 20:27.760
and join the army.

20:28.320 --> 20:29.280
Thank you, General.

20:34.900 --> 20:35.600
Stop there.

20:36.719 --> 20:37.280
Detente.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.399
You widow without education.

20:41.320 --> 20:44.760
Mrs. Shen. Teach them
about proper etiquette.

20:44.820 --> 20:45.510
Yes your Majesty.

20:46.199 --> 20:48.199
The crown princess
is from the inner court,

20:48.399 --> 20:49.040
in the front row.

20:49.050 --> 20:50.820
Lady of the country
is from the outer court,

20:50.840 --> 20:51.560
in the first rank.

20:51.719 --> 20:54.040
The crown princess has a higher rank.

20:54.280 --> 20:57.879
The lady of the country should greet
the crown princess with a serene.

20:58.560 --> 20:59.280
That?

20:59.760 --> 21:02.320
Are you saying I should
show my respect to her?

21:03.439 --> 21:05.639
Lady of Wei is the wife of the Great Governor.

21:05.800 --> 21:07.600
Great governor
has achieved great merits.

21:07.760 --> 21:08.719
So, Your Highness

21:08.879 --> 21:11.479
has exempted you from having
to greet her with a greeting.

21:13.360 --> 21:15.080
I am the personal lady of His Highness.

21:15.239 --> 21:16.000
I am in the sixth rank.

21:16.239 --> 21:17.800
You are the servant of the lady of Wei.

21:17.959 --> 21:18.760
You have no ranking.

21:18.959 --> 21:19.600
Which is it?

21:19.959 --> 21:21.719
A maid who has no ranking wants

21:21.770 --> 21:23.439
to hit a personal lady
in the sixth rank?

21:23.639 --> 21:25.600
It sounds like you're confused
about where you are.

21:25.760 --> 21:27.000
You have no manners at all.

21:27.560 --> 21:30.320
What a sharp tongue you have.

21:30.520 --> 21:32.020
Thank you for the compliment, Madam de Wei.

21:32.239 --> 21:34.199
The Great Governor is humble and courteous.

21:34.479 --> 21:36.320
Now that you have entered the palace,

21:36.479 --> 21:38.959
you have to follow the rules
and proper etiquette too

21:39.159 --> 21:40.720
so that you are not a laughing stock.

21:42.520 --> 21:43.639
A laughable resource.

21:43.959 --> 21:45.040
I want to see

21:45.280 --> 21:47.120
who dares to laugh at me now.

21:53.479 --> 21:56.679
You will be taught a lesson
if you have no manners.

21:58.159 --> 22:00.080
You...

22:01.040 --> 22:02.399
You're crazy!

22:04.800 --> 22:06.159
Stop crying.

22:06.320 --> 22:07.520
To be honest,

22:07.639 --> 22:10.280
(Duke Zheng)
rumors are quite unpleasant.

22:10.800 --> 22:12.120
Sin embargo, Xiao

22:12.280 --> 22:13.840
She is still the princess of the former crown.

22:13.910 --> 22:15.810
Since the former crown prince
committed suicide,

22:15.820 --> 22:16.919
I should have followed

22:17.080 --> 22:18.360
it made sense.

22:18.370 --> 22:19.040
Even if he didn't,

22:19.199 --> 22:21.679
she should have become a nun to remain loyal
to the former crown prince.

22:23.320 --> 22:24.159
great governor

22:24.320 --> 22:25.719
He is a wise man.

22:25.840 --> 22:26.320
Because

22:26.439 --> 22:28.000
so he took this woman?

22:29.879 --> 22:31.719
She must have put a spell on him.

22:34.679 --> 22:35.520
Think about it.

22:36.399 --> 22:37.520
With the years,

22:38.120 --> 22:39.959
Had married

22:40.120 --> 22:41.280
so many wives and concubines.

22:41.520 --> 22:43.399
But he had never hated anyone before.

22:44.560 --> 22:47.040
I can't allow this to continue.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.320
Don't panic.

22:48.840 --> 22:51.040
There are still countless battles
ahead of us.

22:51.199 --> 22:53.479
The Great Governor still needs
the Chenjun Yuan Clan

22:53.530 --> 22:55.030
fight for him and
call him food.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.479
He won't treat us badly.

22:58.760 --> 23:00.399
But this Xiao

23:00.959 --> 23:02.560
He is adamant about staying in the palace.

23:04.120 --> 23:04.840
Maybe

23:05.000 --> 23:06.840
He has an ulterior motive.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.600
We'll find out what it is eventually.

23:08.800 --> 23:09.239
So,

23:09.439 --> 23:10.879
I will discuss this with our relatives

23:11.080 --> 23:12.800
and convince the Great Governor
to kill this woman

23:12.959 --> 23:14.360
for what he did to you.

23:33.810 --> 23:34.360
You can go.

23:48.479 --> 23:50.320
The river appears clear and shallow.

23:50.879 --> 23:53.120
But how far apart are the river banks?

23:58.919 --> 24:00.600
The Qixi Festival will be here soon.

24:02.600 --> 24:05.479
we saw each other for the first time

24:06.320 --> 24:08.040
en la noche de Qixi.

24:10.879 --> 24:12.400
If I had known this would happen,

24:12.959 --> 24:14.800
We should never have known him.

24:15.439 --> 24:17.520
Why are you saying something
so negative again?

24:18.399 --> 24:19.439
Are you crazy yet

24:19.719 --> 24:21.919
Still crazy about Lady de Wei?

24:29.479 --> 24:31.360
I have lived in the palace for a long time.

24:31.800 --> 24:33.360
This kind of thing happens often.

24:34.280 --> 24:35.560
It's normal for others

24:35.879 --> 24:37.010
favor the one who has power.

24:37.639 --> 24:40.479
Once you lose power,
they will take a step for you.

24:41.280 --> 24:42.120
Hoy,

24:42.639 --> 24:44.879
Madam Wei slapped my personal lady.

24:45.159 --> 24:46.560
If I didn't retaliate,

24:47.360 --> 24:48.360
one day,

24:48.719 --> 24:50.959
I would kill myself with poison.

24:51.439 --> 24:52.560
Do you think that

24:53.080 --> 24:54.159
will punish his legal wife

24:54.159 --> 24:56.280
for me?

24:58.800 --> 25:00.320
I do not think it does.

25:01.800 --> 25:02.919
El Clan Yuan de Chenjun

25:03.080 --> 25:04.520
It's your wife's clan.

25:04.919 --> 25:06.600
And you have always trusted them.

25:06.760 --> 25:08.800
I have offended Madam Wei today.

25:09.040 --> 25:10.719
She should leave the palace
and become a nun.

25:11.159 --> 25:11.800
In that way,

25:11.850 --> 25:13.199
I won't be a thorn in someone's flesh.

25:15.439 --> 25:17.239
You're trying to hit me.

25:19.760 --> 25:21.959
I would not dare.

25:22.360 --> 25:24.439
I'm just afraid that
if I stay here,

25:24.719 --> 25:26.610
I will die one day without knowing
what killed me.

25:26.959 --> 25:28.399
I better become a nun

25:28.620 --> 25:29.959
and stay away from all curses.

25:31.679 --> 25:33.040
I want to see

25:33.360 --> 25:34.399
what monastery

25:34.560 --> 25:35.600
can handle you.

25:42.959 --> 25:45.320
You can build a monastery for me.

25:46.320 --> 25:48.280
In a quiet and beautiful place.

25:49.280 --> 25:50.800
I want him to be close to Xichang.

25:51.639 --> 25:54.520
That way,
it will be easy to visit me.

25:55.719 --> 25:59.120
But maybe after leaving the palace,

25:59.719 --> 26:01.040
you will forget everything about me

26:04.679 --> 26:06.320
In a few days.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.360
Do you really want to be a nun?

26:15.000 --> 26:16.710
I don't want to stay in the palace anymore.

26:17.399 --> 26:18.040
Lady of Wei

26:18.199 --> 26:19.959
He is not a magnanimous person.

26:20.600 --> 26:23.280
She likes to make things
difficult for me.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.360
Furthermore, everyone in the palace

26:26.520 --> 26:27.959
He has a sharp tongue.

26:28.679 --> 26:29.320
I don't want to

26:29.439 --> 26:31.000
be gossiped about by them already.

26:37.520 --> 26:40.080
Forget about being nuns.

26:42.320 --> 26:43.159
But

26:43.600 --> 26:45.199
your personal lady, Mrs. Shen,

26:45.639 --> 26:47.439
He seems like someone with a lot of fortune.

26:48.399 --> 26:50.879
Maybe she can become a
nun instead of you.

26:55.600 --> 26:57.399
Finally, you have told the truth.

26:57.720 --> 26:59.400
To preserve the dignity of the Lady of Wei,

26:59.520 --> 27:01.010
do you want to send my maid

27:01.239 --> 27:02.239
to become a nun.

27:02.679 --> 27:04.320
Just give me
a glass of poisoned liquor.

27:04.679 --> 27:05.600
Mrs. Shen and me

27:05.760 --> 27:07.320
will drink that poisoned liquor at once.

27:10.239 --> 27:11.560
She is your maid.

27:12.120 --> 27:13.479
She offended Madam Wei.

27:13.639 --> 27:14.959
I have no choice but to punish her.

27:16.320 --> 27:17.840
And the Lady of Wei's servant?

27:18.000 --> 27:19.159
I offended me.

27:19.399 --> 27:20.040
You'll

27:20.199 --> 27:21.479
ask her to become a nun too?

27:23.600 --> 27:24.399
Look to you.

27:24.919 --> 27:25.239
Are

27:25.439 --> 27:26.719
so eager to win at everything.

27:28.399 --> 27:31.560
If you act justly and punish
that servant too,

27:32.199 --> 27:34.120
I will send Mrs. Shen away
to become a nun.

27:34.600 --> 27:36.719
Otherwise, it's not an opportunity.

28:00.520 --> 28:01.710
Are you pinching your tunic?

28:02.239 --> 28:02.959
Let me help you.

28:03.120 --> 28:03.879
Forget it.

28:04.439 --> 28:05.600
I'm better at this than you.

28:06.310 --> 28:08.200
When you pack up
your torn tights last time,

28:08.320 --> 28:10.010
those points
were as long as centipedes.

28:13.470 --> 28:14.570
I want to ask you something.

28:15.159 --> 28:16.280
Listen

28:16.479 --> 28:17.840
you're going to let Miss Gu

28:17.920 --> 28:19.730
You travel with our army
in men's clothing, right?

28:20.159 --> 28:20.639
Yeah.

28:21.399 --> 28:22.000
She's alone

28:22.159 --> 28:23.080
with his maid.

28:23.120 --> 28:24.470
He wants to return
to the capital city.

28:24.479 --> 28:26.320
It is a battlefield everywhere.

28:26.719 --> 28:28.320
She can't survive the trip alone.

28:28.639 --> 28:29.280
Instead,

28:29.399 --> 28:30.879
can travel together with our army.

28:31.199 --> 28:32.080
This is the first time.

28:32.530 --> 28:34.959
This is the first time I see you
treating a lady so kindly.

28:35.959 --> 28:37.320
Are you going to become

28:37.520 --> 28:38.919
a resplendent old woman
when there is no war?

28:39.520 --> 28:40.199
No.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.120
I really think that

28:42.280 --> 28:43.760
that Miss Gu is a good woman.

28:43.919 --> 28:44.919
It's good enough for you.

28:45.239 --> 28:46.000
It's good for you.

28:51.520 --> 28:53.360
It seems that you have fallen in with Miss Gu.

28:53.879 --> 28:54.719
¿Yo?

28:54.840 --> 28:55.520
This is easy.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.479
I am going to write a letter to Great General Pei

28:57.639 --> 28:58.320
to propose to you.

28:58.360 --> 28:58.800
No.

28:58.920 --> 29:00.340
What nonsense are you talking about?

29:01.020 --> 29:02.239
You're the one he likes.

29:02.320 --> 29:03.290
For the first time,

29:03.320 --> 29:04.080
you allowed a woman

29:04.280 --> 29:05.360
travel with our army.

29:05.840 --> 29:07.320
So stop dragging me into this.

29:07.770 --> 29:09.040
What about being a woman?

29:09.719 --> 29:11.560
Look at Lieutenant He
of the Cui family.

29:12.040 --> 29:13.040
She is smart and cunning.

29:13.290 --> 29:14.720
And she's good at leading her troops.

29:15.320 --> 29:17.080
He's so much better than
so many men out there.

29:25.439 --> 29:27.000
From what you have said,

29:27.199 --> 29:29.120
It seems that
you are in love with the lieutenant

29:29.719 --> 29:31.320
instead of Miss Gu.

29:32.919 --> 29:34.000
Without sense.

29:34.800 --> 29:36.199
Has no sense?

29:49.879 --> 29:50.679
Lieutenant.

29:51.159 --> 29:52.239
Lieutenant.

29:52.919 --> 29:53.679
The paper mill.

29:53.820 --> 29:56.080
I recovered the paper mill
you left at the inn.

29:56.760 --> 29:57.520
Show me.

29:58.919 --> 29:59.520
But wait.

30:00.159 --> 30:01.879
This is just a paper mill.

30:02.080 --> 30:04.399
Why did you leave it
on the counter at the inn ?

30:04.620 --> 30:06.439
if you were going to
send me to look for him?

30:06.840 --> 30:07.399
Mira.

30:07.679 --> 30:08.679
This is just a toy

30:08.879 --> 30:09.840
that is sold in a market.

30:10.120 --> 30:11.959
It is not unique and has no value.

30:12.360 --> 30:13.040
And it has broken.

30:13.120 --> 30:13.959
Why do you keep it?

30:14.159 --> 30:14.760
It's broken?

30:15.719 --> 30:16.080
Mira.

30:18.320 --> 30:19.159
It wasn't broken

30:19.220 --> 30:20.520
when I gave it to the innkeeper.

30:20.719 --> 30:21.560
It seems that

30:21.660 --> 30:22.879
He didn't take good care of him.

30:24.199 --> 30:25.320
It's broken here too.

30:48.959 --> 30:50.080
This is not how you fix it.

30:50.239 --> 30:51.959
You will be cut by the bamboo strip.

30:52.879 --> 30:53.479
Let me do it.

30:53.820 --> 30:55.390
This type of work is not for you.

31:54.370 --> 31:54.800
It's fixed.

31:59.639 --> 32:02.479
Let's attend the Lantern Festival
tomorrow night together.

32:04.120 --> 32:05.620
Don't you have
to direct the program tomorrow?

32:05.630 --> 32:06.879
I already named someone else

32:07.080 --> 32:08.360
to do that kind of boring task.

32:08.690 --> 32:09.280
And you?

32:09.760 --> 32:11.520
Do you have to accompany you
, Young Master Cui?

32:12.399 --> 32:13.120
No.

32:14.639 --> 32:15.760
It's a deal then.

32:20.360 --> 32:21.159
See you then.

32:31.760 --> 32:32.439
Lieutenant.

32:32.800 --> 32:33.919
Did you fix the windmill?

32:34.399 --> 32:35.239
Yeah.

32:37.239 --> 32:37.919
Lieutenant.

32:37.920 --> 32:40.040
Let's enjoy the Lantern Festival
together at night.

32:40.370 --> 32:41.479
I have things to do tonight.

32:41.639 --> 32:42.239
I'll pass.

32:42.770 --> 32:43.810
Are you going to accompany

32:43.850 --> 32:45.320
Young Master to the Lantern Festival?

32:45.600 --> 32:47.040
Sitting under the well-lit shed

32:47.239 --> 32:48.040
Why do people gossip?

32:48.199 --> 32:48.959
I'll pass.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.800
What do you have to do then?

32:53.000 --> 32:53.639
Yo,

32:54.280 --> 32:55.520
I am afraid that the Zhenxi army

32:55.620 --> 32:56.710
I will do something secretly.

32:56.720 --> 32:57.990
So I have to keep an eye on them

32:58.000 --> 32:59.239
to find out what your plan is.

32:59.679 --> 33:01.360
Alright. I will go with you

33:01.520 --> 33:02.239
to help you.

33:02.370 --> 33:03.080
You do not have to do it.

33:04.679 --> 33:07.600
You can keep an eye on Xie Chang'er
of the Zhenxi Army for me.

33:07.879 --> 33:08.639
It's not just him

33:08.760 --> 33:10.159
the man Li Ni trusts,

33:10.160 --> 33:11.720
can gather intelligence
from the sound of the wind.

33:11.740 --> 33:13.159
You have to watch him closely.

33:13.679 --> 33:15.879
Don't give him any chance
to act secretly.

33:27.040 --> 33:28.000
Ear.

33:28.470 --> 33:29.919
Why are you pulling such a long face?

33:31.760 --> 33:34.080
Mr. Shiqi has ordered us
to behead Han Li in public.

33:34.120 --> 33:35.190
during the Lantern Festival

33:35.200 --> 33:36.510
to make a name for the Zhenxi Army.

33:36.560 --> 33:37.159
Yeah.

33:37.399 --> 33:39.040
We have done everything

33:39.239 --> 33:40.560
according to Mr. Shiqi's order.

33:41.719 --> 33:42.360
but he asked me

33:42.520 --> 33:43.479
to drive away Miss Taozi

33:43.919 --> 33:44.919
of the lieutenant.

33:45.080 --> 33:45.840
Because?

33:47.280 --> 33:48.280
Since someone

33:48.439 --> 33:50.320
Taozi does not want
to follow Lieutenant He,

33:50.479 --> 33:52.959
It means that another person
in your place wants to follow you.

33:53.159 --> 33:55.199
Just do what he said.

33:55.959 --> 33:56.600
But how can I

33:56.800 --> 33:58.280
Lure Miss Taozi out?

33:58.760 --> 33:59.679
Do they knock her out?

34:02.360 --> 34:04.159
She uses poison and is cunning.

34:04.360 --> 34:06.560
If he had to fight her,
he couldn't win.

34:07.479 --> 34:08.759
Your brain

34:08.920 --> 34:10.440
It is made of wood.

34:11.159 --> 34:12.120
You can just invite her

34:12.279 --> 34:13.080
to enjoy

34:13.279 --> 34:14.480
the Lantern Festival with you.

34:19.719 --> 34:20.199
Here you have.

34:20.639 --> 34:21.719
Think about it.

34:29.960 --> 34:30.839
Miss Taozi.

34:33.400 --> 34:34.040
Miss Taozi.

34:35.600 --> 34:38.400
What if we enjoy

34:38.600 --> 34:40.000
the Lantern Festival together today?

34:46.080 --> 34:47.880
Why do you invite me?

34:49.560 --> 34:53.080
Because I'm alone today.

34:53.440 --> 34:54.719
Others have other things to do.

34:55.120 --> 34:56.400
And it seems that

34:56.600 --> 34:57.319
you are alone too.

34:57.679 --> 34:58.319
And we

34:58.480 --> 34:59.839
so you are inviting me

35:00.000 --> 35:00.880
because you are bored.

35:01.040 --> 35:01.520
No.

35:01.719 --> 35:02.440
No, Miss Taozi.

35:02.639 --> 35:03.440
That's not what I was referring to.

35:05.799 --> 35:06.199
Forget it.

35:06.400 --> 35:07.319
Forget what I said.

35:08.159 --> 35:08.839
Stop there.

35:12.520 --> 35:13.880
Since you wanted to invite me,

35:14.080 --> 35:14.880
then you invite me.

35:15.120 --> 35:16.510
Why are you changing your mind now?

35:16.960 --> 35:18.120
Who do you think I am?

35:18.679 --> 35:19.799
No. Miss Taozi.

35:19.800 --> 35:21.110
- Let me explain.
- I'm with you.

35:23.400 --> 35:25.120
Enjoy
the Lantern Festival together.

35:26.679 --> 35:27.759
Thank you, Miss Taozi.

35:29.420 --> 35:30.120
No need to thank me.

35:30.319 --> 35:32.239
After all, you have saved me from trouble.

35:34.440 --> 35:35.359
What a problem?

35:37.000 --> 35:39.560
Come take a look.

35:47.600 --> 35:48.520
Be careful.

35:50.839 --> 35:52.440
Why are you dressing like that today?

35:52.440 --> 35:53.639
You look beautiful.

35:53.920 --> 35:55.239
Since I'm here to spy on someone,

35:55.319 --> 35:56.759
Of course I need to change.

35:57.040 --> 35:58.319
This is a trick

35:58.319 --> 35:59.799
make others let their guard down.

36:00.560 --> 36:01.480
Indeed, you are wise.

36:02.159 --> 36:04.319
Let's get down to business.

37:04.720 --> 37:05.810
You are so pretty today.

37:06.190 --> 37:07.440
I almost couldn't recognize you.

37:11.870 --> 37:12.319
Let's go.

37:34.600 --> 37:35.600
Amazing!

37:36.000 --> 37:36.719
Again!

37:36.960 --> 37:38.279
Incredible!

37:52.520 --> 37:53.440
That's great!

37:54.040 --> 37:55.040
Windmills,

37:55.440 --> 37:57.719
beautiful and fun windmills.

37:58.000 --> 37:58.400
Again!

37:58.600 --> 37:59.040
Genial.

37:59.359 --> 38:01.000
Give me a windmill, please.

38:01.279 --> 38:02.400
Choose one.

38:03.880 --> 38:04.679
I take this.

38:05.359 --> 38:05.920
Alright.

38:06.880 --> 38:07.359
Pay for it.

38:12.239 --> 38:13.120
Do you like windmills?

38:14.480 --> 38:15.560
Not really.

38:15.920 --> 38:17.759
But our lieutenant has a windmill

38:17.960 --> 38:18.759
in his notebook.

38:18.840 --> 38:19.299
GOOD!

38:19.340 --> 38:20.560
And he is always in a good mood

38:20.650 --> 38:21.880
when you see him every day.

38:22.319 --> 38:24.159
He refused to throw it away.

38:24.359 --> 38:25.400
when it broke out that day.

38:25.639 --> 38:27.239
She even fixed herself.

38:27.920 --> 38:29.400
But paper mills are not expensive.

38:29.570 --> 38:30.440
Only two copper coins.

38:30.799 --> 38:31.600
It's true.

38:32.040 --> 38:33.440
I told him the same.

38:33.920 --> 38:36.639
I told him we could
buy a new one together.

38:37.239 --> 38:39.319
But she said she wouldn't understand.

38:39.480 --> 38:40.239
She said

38:40.440 --> 38:42.639
than to buy a windmill yourself

38:42.839 --> 38:44.960
It wasn't as fun as getting
a windmill as a gift.

38:45.319 --> 38:47.319
So when I just saw that person,

38:47.520 --> 38:48.199
I told myself

38:48.560 --> 38:49.370
that I wanted someone

38:49.440 --> 38:50.199
to give me one too.

38:50.719 --> 38:52.319
I want to see

38:52.600 --> 38:54.359
how fun a windmill can be

38:54.560 --> 38:56.279
when it is a gift from someone else.

38:56.799 --> 38:58.639
Is that why
you asked me to buy it for you?

39:00.279 --> 39:01.920
I'm sure you feel honored

39:02.120 --> 39:04.080
to buy something for myself.

39:05.560 --> 39:06.359
Yes Yes.

39:10.400 --> 39:12.880
But what's so fun

39:13.120 --> 39:14.520
to get a windmill as a gift?

39:14.880 --> 39:16.319
Why don't I feel the same?

39:35.960 --> 39:38.759
Am I dreaming
or is the river full of stars?

39:39.799 --> 39:41.199
This place is beautiful.

39:41.920 --> 39:43.199
The stars at Laolan Pass

39:43.440 --> 39:44.600
They are much bigger

39:44.960 --> 39:46.000
and closer.

39:47.120 --> 39:48.820
When you're lying in the desert
at midnight,

39:49.319 --> 39:51.159
The sky is as dark as silk.

39:51.799 --> 39:52.920
Like you could touch the star

39:53.120 --> 39:54.560
just extending it.

39:55.359 --> 39:56.759
We have steppe

39:57.000 --> 39:58.639
as far as the eyes can see in Pingliang.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.120
When he was young,

40:00.319 --> 40:01.960
My father went hunting with me.

40:02.480 --> 40:05.120
Sometimes, I would fall asleep
on the back of the horse.

40:05.679 --> 40:07.480
When I woke up and opened my eyes,

40:07.759 --> 40:09.279
I could see every star

40:09.520 --> 40:10.600
in the sky.

40:11.159 --> 40:13.410
They looked like sugar crystals
that were about to fall.

40:15.120 --> 40:16.920
I grew up in the capital.

40:17.440 --> 40:18.839
After learning to walk,

40:19.440 --> 40:20.880
always rides alone to go

40:21.040 --> 40:21.839
al Wonderland.

40:23.220 --> 40:25.300
The Wonderland is a famous place
in the capital city.

40:25.880 --> 40:27.080
It is located on high ground.

40:27.520 --> 40:28.410
On,

40:29.000 --> 40:30.880
you can overlook the entire capital city.

40:33.420 --> 40:36.440
Hear the fox and the chirp in the forest,
see the rainbow on the other side.

40:36.719 --> 40:39.239
Feel the west breeze
in the wonders.

40:39.759 --> 40:42.679
Keep riding deep into the sunset.

40:42.880 --> 40:45.920
May the sun never set.

40:46.799 --> 40:48.440
So, you like this poem.

40:48.639 --> 40:49.639
But I like the other one.

40:50.159 --> 40:50.920
Wait.

40:52.040 --> 40:53.279
I know which one you like.

40:53.639 --> 40:54.199
That?

40:55.279 --> 40:57.080
There is grass everywhere
on the prairie.

40:57.359 --> 40:59.279
Each year, it will wither during the fall.

40:59.639 --> 41:01.080
But you can never burn it.

41:01.319 --> 41:03.040
Will be back again
when spring is here.

41:03.600 --> 41:04.639
Is that the only one?

41:10.320 --> 41:12.040
How do you know
I like that poem?

41:12.400 --> 41:14.920
Know your enemies well
so you can defeat them.

41:15.319 --> 41:15.839
See

41:15.880 --> 41:17.159
that Li Ni is someone like that.

41:17.359 --> 41:18.560
That's why I know

41:18.620 --> 41:19.639
that you like this poem.

41:23.040 --> 41:24.719
You're amazing, Lieutenant.

41:24.880 --> 41:25.839
You are my close friend.

41:26.880 --> 41:27.639
I like that.

41:28.759 --> 41:29.480
Without sense.

41:29.839 --> 41:30.960
I did not say

41:31.120 --> 41:32.210
I am your bosom friend.

41:32.239 --> 41:33.040
I did not say

41:33.279 --> 41:34.239
that you said that

41:40.319 --> 41:41.839
Why is my dress wet?

41:43.440 --> 41:45.239
This is bad. The boat is leaking.
