=Episode 23=

01:54.793 --> 01:55.721
Ayah.

01:56.634 --> 01:59.034
I offered a drink
to say congratulations to my father.

02:00.513 --> 02:01.754
After drinking,

02:02.953 --> 02:04.634
me and Ying will

02:05.834 --> 02:07.433
get married

02:09.229 --> 02:10.158
Drink it.

02:18.870 --> 02:19.910
The commander-in-chief is aware.

02:20.114 --> 02:20.433
Of.

02:20.753 --> 02:21.109
Good.

02:21.110 --> 02:21.690
He was aware.

02:21.794 --> 02:22.596
Commander.

02:34.593 --> 02:35.473
Controller.

02:37.794 --> 02:39.834
Bind this rebellious child.

02:40.794 --> 02:41.698
Commander.

02:42.633 --> 02:44.313
The poison in the father's body has not been offered.

02:44.994 --> 02:46.394
He was still confused.

02:47.033 --> 02:47.940
Controller.

02:49.033 --> 02:50.593
Send him back to the room.

02:50.670 --> 02:51.713
- Young master.
- Young master.

03:00.633 --> 03:01.674
Rebellious child.

03:03.753 --> 03:05.674
Didn't think so

03:06.554 --> 03:09.234
you will mistreat father.

03:20.234 --> 03:20.794
Young master!

03:21.820 --> 03:22.834
Be careful, commander-in-chief!

03:22.994 --> 03:23.713
Great Commander!

03:24.354 --> 03:24.873
Young master!

03:25.033 --> 03:25.913
What is the reason?

03:25.920 --> 03:27.340
Are there any misunderstandings?

03:27.354 --> 03:28.153
Yes, young master.

03:28.554 --> 03:30.114
This is the commander in chief, young master.

03:47.554 --> 03:48.753
The commander-in-chief was confused.

03:49.193 --> 03:50.234
Quickly grab his sword

03:50.520 --> 03:51.740
so that he doesn't hurt himself.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.234
Dream it.

03:55.354 --> 03:56.394
He is the commander in chief.

03:56.620 --> 03:57.633
Be careful, commander-in-chief!

03:57.650 --> 03:58.274
Great Commander!

03:58.954 --> 03:59.674
Young master!

03:59.794 --> 04:01.354
Are there any misunderstandings?

04:16.393 --> 04:17.474
Great Commander!

04:19.720 --> 04:21.340
Who dares
to hurt the commander-in-chief?

04:21.354 --> 04:22.554
Be careful!

04:28.554 --> 04:30.513
We will get married later.

04:31.234 --> 04:32.873
Don't hurt my wife.

04:33.354 --> 04:34.994
who is your wife

04:44.073 --> 04:45.313
Shu, stop!

05:05.234 --> 05:06.633
Orang Jieshuo.

05:15.120 --> 05:17.570
The young master let the Jieshuo people
sneak in on the pretext of marriage.

05:17.633 --> 05:19.114
We trusted him in vain.

05:48.474 --> 05:49.273
Young Master Cui.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.234
Do not try to escape.

05:51.354 --> 05:52.354
Mr. Shiqi has already said.

05:52.474 --> 05:52.953
Yes

05:53.073 --> 05:54.234
not Young Master Cui.

05:54.313 --> 05:55.433
Namanya Liu Chengfeng.

05:55.440 --> 05:57.300
It's not wrong
to call him Tuan Muda Cui.

05:57.313 --> 05:59.250
Now, he was still disguising himself
as Young Master Cui.

05:59.273 --> 06:00.250
Namun, namanya Liu Chengfeng.

06:00.273 --> 06:01.193
Young Master Cui.

06:01.234 --> 06:02.073
Liu Chengfeng.

06:02.120 --> 06:02.690
Young Master Cui.

06:02.753 --> 06:03.513
Liu Cheng...

06:29.714 --> 06:30.994
Rebellious child.

06:31.873 --> 06:33.674
How dare you
conspire with the Jieshuo people.

06:34.073 --> 06:34.633
Have you

06:34.714 --> 06:36.594
forget

06:36.674 --> 06:38.114
Cui Family revenge?

06:38.584 --> 06:39.464
Cui Yi!

06:40.663 --> 06:41.944
The situation has become like this.

06:42.504 --> 06:43.704
Do not pretend

06:43.784 --> 06:45.584
be a loving father.

06:46.863 --> 06:47.584
I asked you.

06:49.063 --> 06:50.504
Have you ever been sincere?

06:53.103 --> 06:54.743
You once considered me

06:54.760 --> 06:56.344
as your own child sincerely?

06:58.743 --> 07:00.103
You're just using me.

07:02.144 --> 07:02.784
What does it matter?

07:02.904 --> 07:04.824
grudge between the Cui Family and Jieshuo

07:05.344 --> 07:06.663
with me?

07:08.944 --> 07:09.983
Okay.

07:11.824 --> 07:13.904
I have no son.

07:15.863 --> 07:17.423
I only have one daughter.

07:23.663 --> 07:24.543
Ying.

07:25.824 --> 07:26.824
You don't have to

07:27.704 --> 07:29.024
keep your identity a secret again.

07:35.344 --> 07:35.983
All.

07:38.584 --> 07:39.863
This is my daughter.

07:43.344 --> 07:45.264
He is the real Cui Lin.

07:46.504 --> 07:47.144
He too

07:48.504 --> 07:49.784
using the name Cui Lin

07:49.904 --> 07:50.904
in a military camp.

07:52.183 --> 07:54.743
I also always considered him
as my own son.

07:56.704 --> 07:58.784
Today, he brought in our enemies

07:59.423 --> 08:01.144
and don't want to be my child anymore.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.264
So,

08:05.223 --> 08:06.944
I only have one daughter.

08:09.103 --> 08:10.264
Cui Lin

08:11.024 --> 08:13.183
my only child

08:14.663 --> 08:16.183
However, he is greater

08:17.183 --> 08:18.824
of men in this world.

08:22.303 --> 08:23.423
Liu Chengfeng.

08:24.620 --> 08:26.103
Since
you colluded with Jieshuo,

08:26.183 --> 08:27.543
poison me,

08:29.543 --> 08:31.663
rebel and bring in enemies,

08:31.743 --> 08:33.663
you are unfaithful,
immoral and disobedient.

08:35.823 --> 08:37.423
Your crime has been revealed.

08:38.624 --> 08:40.224
Give up quickly!

08:46.504 --> 08:47.024
You remember

08:47.144 --> 08:48.784
can you catch me today?

09:02.820 --> 09:04.320
There is a blue light
on the arrow head.

09:04.384 --> 09:05.663
Presumably it was coated with poison.

09:06.504 --> 09:07.264
Li Ni.

09:08.463 --> 09:09.984
Your identity limits you

09:10.784 --> 09:12.904
to bring in the military.

09:14.063 --> 09:15.463
You are just a few people

09:17.183 --> 09:18.703
can catch me?

09:19.144 --> 09:21.744
I want to kill you.

09:22.240 --> 09:23.303
- Dad!
- Commander in chief!

09:23.744 --> 09:24.384
Dad, are you okay?

09:25.063 --> 09:25.744
It's fine.

09:26.920 --> 09:27.463
Do not worry.

09:28.104 --> 09:29.504
The Zhenxi army was outside the city.

09:33.543 --> 09:34.543
If we fight again,

09:34.820 --> 09:36.570
both parties will definitely
suffer huge losses.

09:37.264 --> 09:38.504
Lepaskan Liu Chengfeng.

09:42.144 --> 09:42.864
Go away from here!

09:58.063 --> 09:58.703
Shiqi.

09:58.820 --> 10:00.780
Your men are hiding
to ambush outside the city.

10:01.144 --> 10:02.700
Liu Chengfeng had already
brought people out of the city.

10:03.063 --> 10:04.144
You can attack them.

10:22.620 --> 10:23.224
Slowly.

10:28.463 --> 10:28.984
Ayah.

10:29.583 --> 10:31.744
I told Taozi
to check dad's pulse.

10:31.864 --> 10:32.744
No need.

10:32.864 --> 10:33.543
Dad, it's okay.

10:33.943 --> 10:35.183
Taozi has already said.

10:35.663 --> 10:37.303
He himself provided this antidote.

10:37.310 --> 10:38.770
Poison will be offered
slowly.

10:38.784 --> 10:40.144
It's good, father, don't fight.

10:40.420 --> 10:41.800
When father found out
this was the crime of the disobedient son,

10:41.823 --> 10:43.024
Dad couldn't help himself.

10:44.504 --> 10:46.384
I didn't think
he conspired with Jieshuo.

10:49.224 --> 10:50.303
He knew the Cui Family

10:50.423 --> 10:52.144
berdendam dengan Jieshuo.

10:55.063 --> 10:56.104
I don't know why

10:56.104 --> 10:57.583
he became like this.

10:59.120 --> 11:01.010
It was in vain that his father thought of
him as his biological son

11:01.024 --> 11:02.264
many years.

11:07.663 --> 11:08.264
Ayah,

11:10.800 --> 11:11.703
don't be sad anymore.

11:19.104 --> 11:19.984
Ying,

11:21.780 --> 11:23.530
after your father and mother
have been married for ten years,

11:23.543 --> 11:24.663
you were just born.

11:25.504 --> 11:27.624
Although father announced

11:28.104 --> 11:29.504
you are a man

11:29.720 --> 11:32.463
so that the government
does not grant the father another wife,

11:34.063 --> 11:34.984
your father and mother

11:35.020 --> 11:36.640
have a
selfish mind,

11:37.040 --> 11:39.104
that is, we want to
leave everything in the Cui Family

11:39.343 --> 11:40.543
to you.

11:42.703 --> 11:45.904
Only sons
are important in this world.

11:46.303 --> 11:48.663
No daughter
ever inherits the family property,

11:49.144 --> 11:51.543
especially in the military.

11:51.904 --> 11:53.463
We announce you are a boy

11:54.183 --> 11:55.063
for you

11:55.224 --> 11:57.303
can have everything in the Cui Family.

12:00.543 --> 12:01.864
I understand, father.

12:02.784 --> 12:04.104
Ever since I was sensible,

12:04.543 --> 12:05.703
father told me

12:06.183 --> 12:08.183
about this clearly.

12:09.703 --> 12:11.264
This is my choice too.

12:11.904 --> 12:13.063
I don't find it difficult.

12:14.264 --> 12:15.543
Sadly.

12:16.264 --> 12:17.744
Sama ada Liu Chengfeng

12:18.183 --> 12:19.463
or Cui Li,

12:20.463 --> 12:22.543
how nice

12:23.504 --> 12:25.264
if they can help you.

12:26.543 --> 12:28.264
The human mind is unpredictable.

12:29.144 --> 12:31.343
Even though dad was alert,

12:32.183 --> 12:33.703
appear

12:34.663 --> 12:36.864
a traitor at last.

12:38.343 --> 12:39.384
Ayah.

12:39.943 --> 12:42.104
Dad has done
a lot for me.

12:44.423 --> 12:45.224
Ying.

12:47.264 --> 12:49.624
Dad revealed your identity
today.

12:50.984 --> 12:53.784
I am afraid that many more problems
will be caused in the future.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.384
I know you are wise
and do not hesitate.

12:58.390 --> 12:59.710
You are better than anyone else.

13:01.904 --> 13:03.183
As a father,

13:03.943 --> 13:05.663
Dad is still worried.

13:07.784 --> 13:09.744
If dad doesn't take good care of you,

13:11.024 --> 13:12.543
What kind of

13:14.024 --> 13:16.104
father want to face
your late mother later?

13:19.343 --> 13:20.104
Ayah,

13:20.784 --> 13:22.183
do not worry.

13:22.703 --> 13:24.303
I am my father's son.

13:24.703 --> 13:26.583
Although
many problems will befall me,

13:26.744 --> 13:27.784
finished?

13:28.663 --> 13:29.624
I am

13:29.744 --> 13:31.784
will not be shackled by the worldly.

13:33.823 --> 13:35.024
Good to say you.

13:36.104 --> 13:39.423
Now it's different.

13:42.384 --> 13:43.784
Even though everyone

13:43.784 --> 13:44.784
find our clause,

13:45.224 --> 13:46.744
we are children

13:47.904 --> 13:49.063
no need to be afraid

13:49.744 --> 13:50.303
Of.

13:52.343 --> 13:53.663
Don't worry, dad.

14:04.343 --> 14:05.784
Greetings to the young lady.

14:17.303 --> 14:18.663
Greetings to the commanders.

14:20.504 --> 14:21.624
During the old days,

14:22.120 --> 14:24.303
the government insists on
giving me another wife

14:24.744 --> 14:26.463
because I have no children.

14:28.024 --> 14:30.063
The love between me
and my wife is deep.

14:30.840 --> 14:32.784
After we gave birth to
a daughter,

14:33.320 --> 14:34.984
I said
I got a son.

14:36.303 --> 14:38.463
Then, the situation in
the draw changed.

14:38.943 --> 14:42.504
So, I didn't tell you

14:42.624 --> 14:43.784
about the truth.

14:48.264 --> 14:51.504
Actually, Cui Lin
is my only daughter.

14:52.303 --> 14:53.463
Oh it's like that.

14:54.984 --> 14:56.463
Even if you are young

14:56.703 --> 14:57.904
holding the position of lieutenant only,

14:58.463 --> 14:59.543
we watched

14:59.744 --> 15:01.224
his personal performance.

15:01.920 --> 15:03.280
Women are equal to men.

15:04.420 --> 15:06.110
We will definitely try our best
to help him.

15:06.303 --> 15:07.224
We will definitely obey.

15:08.343 --> 15:10.104
Don't worry, commander in chief.

15:17.423 --> 15:19.024
Me and Junior Commander Pei

15:19.144 --> 15:20.760
hide outside the city
according to your instructions.

15:20.784 --> 15:22.343
Kami memang nampak Liu Chengfeng

15:22.420 --> 15:23.303
membawa orang Jieshuo.

15:23.320 --> 15:25.343
We ambushed him
when he was not ready.

15:25.543 --> 15:26.463
However,

15:26.583 --> 15:28.264
their poison is too great.

15:28.423 --> 15:29.624
Even though many people are attacked,

15:29.823 --> 15:30.984
Liu Chengfeng

15:31.144 --> 15:32.423
still managed to escape.

15:34.984 --> 15:36.504
He's lost his mind.

15:36.820 --> 15:38.024
In fact, he conspired with the enemy.

15:38.520 --> 15:39.823
Jieshuo pandai menggunakan racun.

15:39.920 --> 15:41.063
Later, we must be careful.

15:41.784 --> 15:42.183
Of.

15:44.423 --> 15:46.343
That's Lieutenant He, right?

15:46.703 --> 15:47.063
Not.

15:47.224 --> 15:49.063
Young Miss Cui has arrived.

15:51.384 --> 15:52.703
Young Miss Cui is already struggling.

15:53.183 --> 15:54.224
Brother Bao is already struggling.

15:54.784 --> 15:55.904
We are our own people.

15:56.024 --> 15:57.224
Tentera Zhenxi

15:57.343 --> 15:59.583
willing to help Ms. Young Cui
eliminate the enemy.

16:02.144 --> 16:03.744
I circulated first.

16:03.864 --> 16:05.744
The young lady and Mr. Shiqi are chatting.

16:14.703 --> 16:15.943
Fortunately you are here today.

16:16.504 --> 16:17.543
We are our own people.

16:17.663 --> 16:18.864
Tentera Zhenxi

16:18.984 --> 16:20.904
willing to help Ms. Young Cui
eliminate the enemy.

16:21.024 --> 16:21.744
I'm willing too.

16:21.904 --> 16:22.784
Brash mouth.

16:24.224 --> 16:25.303
Bao said earlier,

16:25.320 --> 16:27.110
they had already wiped out
many Jieshuo people.

16:27.240 --> 16:28.864
However,
Liu Chengfeng managed to escape.

16:33.624 --> 16:35.784
Tak sangka Liu Chengfeng
bersubahat dengan Jieshuo.

16:37.543 --> 16:38.864
Keluarga Cui dan Jieshuo

16:38.984 --> 16:40.624
hold a grudge

16:41.423 --> 16:42.624
From now on,

16:44.504 --> 16:45.823
he's not my brother anymore

16:46.784 --> 16:48.543
He is an enemy of the Cui Family.

16:51.543 --> 16:52.744
I shouldn't say that,

16:52.943 --> 16:54.144
But

16:54.303 --> 16:56.543
after hearing this,
i feel relieved.

17:00.303 --> 17:01.463
You haven't told me yet.

17:01.620 --> 17:03.663
How did you find out
my father was poisoned.

17:03.720 --> 17:04.744
How did you find it?

17:04.863 --> 17:06.264
rancangan Liu Chengfeng

17:06.704 --> 17:08.424
and cooperate with my father?

17:10.424 --> 17:11.543
After I returned to camp,

17:11.560 --> 17:12.504
I thought about this.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.020
The more I think, the more I feel
there is something unfamiliar.

17:14.120 --> 17:15.903
So, Taozi and I
sneaked into the Cui Residence

17:16.024 --> 17:17.303
to investigate the commander-in-chief

17:17.424 --> 17:18.664
exposed to what poison?

17:26.143 --> 17:28.240
Er Duo, control it well
so that other people don't notice.

17:47.303 --> 17:48.184
Taozi is very confident

17:48.823 --> 17:50.424
Panglima besar terkena racun Jieshuo.

17:51.424 --> 17:53.224
Kebetulan awak
terkena racun Jieshuo juga.

17:54.103 --> 17:56.103
At that time,
you saw Liu Chengfeng.

17:56.504 --> 17:57.424
So, I suspect

17:58.120 --> 18:00.200
the incident of the commander-in-chief being poisoned
has something to do with him.

18:00.820 --> 18:01.823
At first, the commander-in-chief

18:01.823 --> 18:02.984
refused to believe it.

18:03.504 --> 18:04.224
Until then,

18:04.800 --> 18:06.218
he found it was indeed his crime.

18:09.664 --> 18:11.224
My father was very sad.

18:18.504 --> 18:19.103
my lord

18:19.120 --> 18:20.010
No need to be so polite.

18:20.464 --> 18:21.784
Do you know about it?

18:22.504 --> 18:23.543
I mean my lord...

18:23.664 --> 18:24.823
Everyone knows that

18:24.944 --> 18:26.024
Cui Yi

18:26.143 --> 18:27.303
have a son.

18:27.320 --> 18:28.970
(Empress, Lu)
Try to guess what happened.

18:29.984 --> 18:32.103
This boy is not his.

18:32.424 --> 18:33.583
Not his son?

18:33.704 --> 18:34.464
That's right.

18:34.664 --> 18:36.464
He has only
one daughter.

18:36.623 --> 18:38.543
Since childhood,
he was raised as a boy.

18:38.550 --> 18:40.560
His daughter
disguised herself as a man

18:40.570 --> 18:42.063
and served
in the Cui Family Army.

18:42.863 --> 18:44.543
Apparently, he is famous.

18:45.424 --> 18:46.704
What's his name?

18:46.984 --> 18:47.944
Leftenan He.

18:49.543 --> 18:51.623
I didn't think something like this existed.

18:55.063 --> 18:56.744
Cui Yi

18:58.143 --> 18:59.984
cheating beta

19:02.103 --> 19:04.303
However, the employees
at the hall said seriously,

19:04.424 --> 19:05.863
Cui Yi is very powerful.

19:06.343 --> 19:07.744
Furthermore, Sun Jing

19:07.863 --> 19:09.744
not dead
and still conquering the Tong Border,

19:09.750 --> 19:10.960
an important military base.

19:11.024 --> 19:11.984
Again,

19:12.103 --> 19:13.704
Cui Yi merampas

19:14.143 --> 19:15.704
Changzhou now.

19:17.184 --> 19:19.184
So, the officers

19:19.343 --> 19:20.383
advise beta

19:20.823 --> 19:23.224
to calm Cui Yi's heart.

19:25.024 --> 19:27.903
A good idea

19:28.424 --> 19:29.903
crossed my mind.

19:31.744 --> 19:33.024
My lord wants...

19:33.744 --> 19:36.343
Cui Yi doesn't have a son, right?

19:37.103 --> 19:39.343
Beta helps him
find an adoptive child.

19:39.863 --> 19:41.704
Until then,

19:41.863 --> 19:43.224
The Cui family has an heir.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.143
So, Commander Cui

19:46.264 --> 19:48.543
will listen to beta instructions later.

19:50.103 --> 19:50.823
my lord

19:51.343 --> 19:53.863
Who do you want to choose
as the heir of the Cui Family?

19:56.543 --> 19:58.744
That's why I
came to meet my sister.

19:58.944 --> 20:00.744
Beta wants to choose one

20:00.863 --> 20:02.024
from your sister's niece

20:02.120 --> 20:03.664
to become the adopted son of the Cui Family.

20:06.063 --> 20:06.704
my lord,

20:07.303 --> 20:09.823
I'm afraid this is not good.

20:10.143 --> 20:11.024
Why?

20:11.184 --> 20:12.623
Don't you want to?

20:14.063 --> 20:15.623
It's not that you don't want to.

20:16.103 --> 20:17.583
Try to think.

20:17.944 --> 20:20.303
Cui Yi Panglima Besar Pingliang,

20:20.704 --> 20:22.143
the commander in chief of the Cui Family Army.

20:23.024 --> 20:23.784
In that year,

20:23.920 --> 20:25.620
he led an army
to conquer Jieshuo.

20:26.024 --> 20:27.063
You have heard

20:27.143 --> 20:28.903
the greatness of Commander-in-Chief Cui.

20:29.504 --> 20:30.543
This kind of person

20:30.863 --> 20:33.543
refused to retreat from Changzhou.

20:34.543 --> 20:37.224
It is obvious that he cannot be
controlled by the government.

20:37.984 --> 20:40.024
Even though my lord has good intentions

20:40.784 --> 20:42.944
to choose an heir for his side,

20:43.143 --> 20:44.704
sister worried about his opinion,

20:45.184 --> 20:46.383
my lord

20:46.543 --> 20:48.383
wanted to seize the Cui Family's property

20:49.224 --> 20:51.424
and military power
against the Cui Family Army.

20:52.264 --> 20:54.184
Beta really thinks so.

20:55.024 --> 20:55.984
After all.

20:56.383 --> 20:59.464
There was no way Cui Yi could have guessed that.

21:02.863 --> 21:05.343
Cui Yi had been leading the military for many years .

21:05.520 --> 21:07.570
He asked his daughter
to disguise herself as a boy.

21:07.583 --> 21:08.944
In fact, his daughter is wise.

21:09.424 --> 21:12.504
Now, he revealed this.

21:12.984 --> 21:15.583
It is impossible that he intended
to find an heir.

21:15.903 --> 21:17.024
Impossible

21:17.303 --> 21:19.103
he could not guess my master's thoughts.

21:21.583 --> 21:23.543
If so, how?

21:29.103 --> 21:32.543
Should I
accept Cui Yi's daughter ?

21:32.704 --> 21:33.823
as an adopted child?

21:34.063 --> 21:36.103
Then, appointed her as a princess.

21:36.224 --> 21:37.664
After she became a princess,

21:39.024 --> 21:40.984
find him
a husband who obeys his word?

21:41.143 --> 21:42.343
Is it like this?

21:43.143 --> 21:44.704
new beta can be ordered

21:44.984 --> 21:47.184
The Cui Family Army?

21:47.704 --> 21:49.303
Cui Yi's daughter

21:49.464 --> 21:50.903
raised like a man.

21:51.543 --> 21:52.903
Presumably,

21:53.024 --> 21:54.224
he's not an ordinary person.

21:55.383 --> 21:57.063
Sister is worried
that she refuses to be a princess.

21:57.224 --> 21:58.784
If she refuses to be a princess,

21:58.903 --> 22:00.464
what does he want to be?

22:01.664 --> 22:03.303
This is just a guess.

22:04.024 --> 22:05.664
If my lord has this plan,

22:06.143 --> 22:07.784
It's good, sir, to send someone

22:07.944 --> 22:08.744
to find out

22:08.903 --> 22:10.383
Young Miss Cui's thoughts.

22:11.143 --> 22:13.823
See if
she wants to be a princess.

22:21.264 --> 22:22.103
Ayah.

22:23.063 --> 22:24.012
Sit down.

22:28.024 --> 22:29.143
In today's series hall,

22:29.343 --> 22:30.863
the occurrence of a matter.

22:31.224 --> 22:33.063
Cui Lin, son of Cui Yi

22:33.823 --> 22:35.024
is a girl.

22:35.664 --> 22:36.543
What?

22:36.944 --> 22:39.103
Cui Yi only has one
daughter.

22:39.583 --> 22:41.224
However, he lied

22:41.623 --> 22:43.184
that she had a son,

22:43.744 --> 22:45.063
namely Cui Lin.

22:45.490 --> 22:47.224
Later,
he received an adopted child.

22:47.623 --> 22:48.704
This adopted child

22:48.823 --> 22:50.704
using the name Cui Lin.

22:50.944 --> 22:52.543
His daughter as well

22:52.960 --> 22:54.143
uses the surname He.

22:54.383 --> 22:56.784
He was famous in the Cui Family Army.

22:56.944 --> 22:58.704
He was known as Lieutenant He.

22:59.543 --> 23:00.863
Apparently Lieutenant He

23:01.024 --> 23:02.464
Cui Yi's daughter.

23:04.224 --> 23:05.143
It should be.

23:07.623 --> 23:09.623
Do you still remember?

23:09.944 --> 23:10.944
Before this, the King of Qin

23:11.103 --> 23:12.623
sneaked into the Capital City of Xichang

23:12.823 --> 23:14.744
to meet father
at the silk shop,

23:15.063 --> 23:16.383
person by his side

23:16.543 --> 23:17.464
is Lieutenant He.

23:17.823 --> 23:19.383
In addition,

23:19.504 --> 23:20.863
Lieutenant He who helped the King of Qin

23:20.984 --> 23:22.063
plan the meeting.

23:26.063 --> 23:27.903
The girl is graceful

23:28.063 --> 23:29.063
and wise.

23:29.120 --> 23:30.910
He makes
a deep impression on people.

23:31.984 --> 23:34.184
Apparently she is Cui Yi's daughter.

23:35.903 --> 23:37.063
Wan'niang.

23:37.264 --> 23:38.464
Dad knows

23:38.583 --> 23:40.103
you have big ambitions.

23:40.784 --> 23:41.784
Considering Cui Lin

23:41.903 --> 23:43.224
Cui Yi's daughter,

23:43.504 --> 23:44.464
King of Qin

23:44.863 --> 23:46.863
maybe like him.

23:52.583 --> 23:53.562
Ayah

23:53.984 --> 23:55.424
will help me

23:58.103 --> 23:59.583
You are so clever.

23:59.784 --> 24:01.024
Dad for sure

24:01.143 --> 24:02.224
try your best

24:02.303 --> 24:03.343
to help you

24:05.784 --> 24:07.424
Cui Yi's daughter is not great either.

24:07.784 --> 24:08.744
His father

24:08.863 --> 24:10.664
commander-in-chief
wields military power.

24:11.063 --> 24:12.024
My father too

24:12.184 --> 24:13.704
chief civil servants.

24:14.424 --> 24:15.903
I just listen

24:16.024 --> 24:17.903
the emperor was afraid of the border officials

24:17.920 --> 24:19.240
who holds military power,

24:19.543 --> 24:21.504
but never heard of it

24:21.704 --> 24:22.944
the emperor is afraid of

24:23.103 --> 24:24.704
gentle civil servant.

24:26.303 --> 24:27.464
Good to say you.

24:27.823 --> 24:28.744
Dad knows

24:28.863 --> 24:30.024
father's daughter

24:30.184 --> 24:32.704
comparable to Cui Yi's daughter.

24:54.664 --> 24:57.303
The young lady looks beautiful
in this kind of dress.

24:59.143 --> 25:00.383
I'm just worried

25:00.583 --> 25:02.424
The young lady showed herself

25:02.543 --> 25:03.744
by wearing men's clothes.

25:04.063 --> 25:05.543
With clothes like this,

25:05.784 --> 25:06.984
will they feel

25:07.103 --> 25:08.063
not used to?

25:09.784 --> 25:10.784
Now,

25:10.944 --> 25:12.863
Dad already told everyone that

25:13.664 --> 25:15.224
I am his only daughter.

25:16.343 --> 25:17.303
In that case,

25:17.464 --> 25:19.264
I have to show

25:19.543 --> 25:20.944
my stripes

25:22.343 --> 25:23.664
As his daughter,

25:25.264 --> 25:26.664
I will definitely make him proud.

25:29.264 --> 25:30.224
Hurry up and see.

25:32.184 --> 25:33.024
So beautiful.

25:33.184 --> 25:34.464
Your taste is good.

25:36.320 --> 25:37.710
Very suitable for young lady's skin color.

25:37.800 --> 25:39.705
Li Ni greeted
the commander-in-chief.

25:40.504 --> 25:42.024
What business does the King of Qin have?

25:43.320 --> 25:44.543
Still about the Changzhou clause.

25:44.770 --> 25:46.264
I want to discuss the Changzhou clause

25:46.583 --> 25:47.504
with the commander in chief.

25:48.504 --> 25:49.424
The new King of Qin

25:49.504 --> 25:50.823
save me

25:51.784 --> 25:52.863
So,

25:53.424 --> 25:55.024
did you come to demand revenge?

25:55.810 --> 25:56.920
I don't dare to do that.

25:59.744 --> 26:00.784
Who sent the letter?

26:00.944 --> 26:02.303
to the Cui Family Army

26:02.903 --> 26:04.583
to save Pei Yuan?

26:04.944 --> 26:06.464
King Qin still remembers, right?

26:07.224 --> 26:08.664
The commander-in-chief held out his hand.

26:08.944 --> 26:10.224
I am very grateful.

26:10.944 --> 26:12.424
However, things have changed.

26:12.903 --> 26:14.303
The great commander conquered Changzhou.

26:14.583 --> 26:16.303
Not only criticized by the government,

26:16.320 --> 26:18.110
even the commander-in-chief
needs to be wary of Sun Jing.

26:18.343 --> 26:19.310
After all,

26:19.903 --> 26:21.303
distance between Changzhou and Luoyang,

26:21.424 --> 26:22.744
Jianzhou, Bingzhou

26:23.063 --> 26:24.504
and a military camp in Pingliang

26:24.664 --> 26:25.903
quite far.

26:26.224 --> 26:28.464
The Cui Family Army is here

26:28.704 --> 26:30.184
not even profitable.

26:31.464 --> 26:33.424
do you mean

26:33.784 --> 26:34.664
Changzhou

26:34.784 --> 26:35.784
useless

26:35.903 --> 26:37.303
for me,

26:37.520 --> 26:38.838
is it ok if i return it to you?

26:39.024 --> 26:40.071
Great Commander.

26:40.280 --> 26:41.810
Why don't I change
Luoyang and Changzhou

26:41.863 --> 26:43.984
dengan Weiyang?

26:44.984 --> 26:46.744
What does King Qin mean?

26:47.063 --> 26:48.984
Although Weiyang is not
in my jurisdiction,

26:49.383 --> 26:51.543
Weiyang is located
to the left of Pingliang.

26:51.823 --> 26:53.143
Civil and military affairs

26:53.303 --> 26:56.184
in my jurisdiction
as Commander-in-Chief of Pingliang.

26:59.383 --> 27:00.583
You want to exchange my stuff

27:00.704 --> 27:02.264
with my stuff?

27:02.664 --> 27:04.143
In fact, you theorized.

27:04.424 --> 27:06.664
Commander-in-chief needs real rights.

27:07.120 --> 27:08.910
Although Weiyang
is close to Pingliang,

27:09.343 --> 27:10.424
there is an army

27:10.430 --> 27:11.383
the administrative center of Youzhou
is based there.

27:11.760 --> 27:13.264
If the hall gives a series of orders,

27:13.623 --> 27:15.264
the great commander controlled Pingliang

27:15.383 --> 27:16.424
Dan Weiyang.

27:16.784 --> 27:17.623
So, great commander

27:17.784 --> 27:19.103
can control

27:19.623 --> 27:20.424
Pingliang's affairs

27:20.583 --> 27:21.823
and Weiyang officially.

27:22.120 --> 27:24.960
Later, the position of the Cui Family Army
will be strong and there will be no worries.

27:25.143 --> 27:27.543
What does the commander in chief think?

27:38.664 --> 27:40.103
In that case,

27:42.543 --> 27:44.464
as long as the ballroom is a draw

27:45.024 --> 27:46.664
hand over Weiyang to me,

27:47.863 --> 27:49.543
I will withdraw from Changzhou.

27:50.504 --> 27:51.944
However, I will not back down

27:52.944 --> 27:54.984
from Luoyang.

27:59.944 --> 28:01.264
The commander-in-chief's mind was firm.

28:01.944 --> 28:04.464
Even though I feel all wrong,

28:04.820 --> 28:06.960
I will ask the Balairung Seri
to issue the order immediately.

28:07.224 --> 28:09.303
I will only bring up Changzhou.

28:09.704 --> 28:10.984
Don't worry, commander in chief.

28:11.944 --> 28:13.143
Okay.

28:14.944 --> 28:16.103
King of Qin.

28:16.944 --> 28:18.504
After the Changzhou clause was settled,

28:19.024 --> 28:21.063
you can go back to the capital.

28:21.464 --> 28:22.744
Great Commander.

28:23.303 --> 28:25.784
I have one more request.

28:26.343 --> 28:27.224
What is he?

28:27.720 --> 28:30.280
I would like to have Young Miss Cui
lead the Cui Family Army

28:30.290 --> 28:31.640
go to the Tong Border with me

28:31.664 --> 28:32.720
to eradicate Sun Jing.

28:35.424 --> 28:37.063
You want to ask my son

28:37.184 --> 28:39.264
go against Sun Jing with you?

28:40.704 --> 28:41.543
King of Qin.

28:42.024 --> 28:43.024
Your request

28:43.143 --> 28:45.184
too many.

28:45.343 --> 28:46.744
If Sun Jing is not eradicated,

28:46.984 --> 28:49.063
not only government officials,

28:49.303 --> 28:51.623
even the commander-in-chief was worried.

28:52.120 --> 28:53.110
Originally, the commander-in-chief

28:53.120 --> 28:54.980
led the army
to the south waving the army flag.

28:55.180 --> 28:57.100
Now, the commander-in-chief is
temporarily based in Changzhou

28:57.224 --> 28:58.863
and defend Luoyang.

28:59.184 --> 29:01.143
Of course, the audience is buzzing.

29:01.320 --> 29:03.103
As long as the commander-in-chief agrees
the Cui Family Army and me

29:03.224 --> 29:04.623
go to the Barrel Border

29:04.630 --> 29:06.680
to defeat Sun Jing
and recapture the Tong Border,

29:07.184 --> 29:08.504
rumors in the draw hall

29:08.863 --> 29:10.343
will end.

29:10.664 --> 29:11.784
In fact, everyone

29:11.984 --> 29:14.264
will praise the obedience of the commander-in-chief.

29:15.024 --> 29:16.583
What if I don't agree?

29:16.720 --> 29:18.583
After I myself
recaptured the Tong Border,

29:19.143 --> 29:20.264
maybe a series hall

29:20.490 --> 29:21.419
will order me

29:21.420 --> 29:22.680
to fight with the commander-in-chief.

29:22.704 --> 29:23.744
Until then,

29:24.303 --> 29:26.424
I can't refuse it.

29:26.784 --> 29:29.543
Hall series

29:30.103 --> 29:31.583
will definitely recapture Dongdu first.

29:32.583 --> 29:34.504
Try the King of Qin.

29:36.063 --> 29:36.664
I am

29:36.823 --> 29:39.063
never fought with the King of Qin.

29:39.504 --> 29:41.343
I would like to witness

29:41.664 --> 29:43.944
the arrangement of the army of the King of Qin.

29:44.103 --> 29:45.464
I don't want to

29:45.903 --> 29:47.504
hostile to the Cui Family Army.

29:48.063 --> 29:49.543
The commander-in-chief knows too.

29:49.664 --> 29:51.784
The border of Tong locks the two cities.

29:51.840 --> 29:52.623
Besides the Barrel Border,

29:52.630 --> 29:54.380
there is no other place to
defend these two cities.

29:54.424 --> 29:56.360
As long as the commander-in-chief
agreed to the Cui Family Army

29:56.424 --> 29:57.944
go to the Tong Border with me,

29:58.583 --> 29:59.704
suspicion of the government

29:59.760 --> 30:01.704
against the Cui Family Army
will be reduced.

30:02.224 --> 30:04.823
Hopefully the commander-in-chief
can fulfill this request.

30:11.664 --> 30:13.103
In that case,

30:15.063 --> 30:16.623
My son does not need to go with you.

30:17.184 --> 30:19.903
I went to
the Tong Border with you.

30:20.063 --> 30:20.984
Indeed so.

30:21.903 --> 30:23.704
Before this,
I discussed with Ying.

30:24.303 --> 30:25.184
He told me.

30:25.623 --> 30:26.184
Great Commander

30:26.343 --> 30:27.823
will definitely say so.

30:28.024 --> 30:29.504
I asked Ying if it was appropriate for me to answer.

30:30.464 --> 30:31.418
Ying told me.

30:31.583 --> 30:32.660
Talk

30:33.640 --> 30:35.224
he and I have reached an agreement.

30:35.543 --> 30:37.383
He is willing to go with me.

30:38.264 --> 30:40.303
If you have reached agreement,

30:40.464 --> 30:41.823
why are you asking me again?

30:43.464 --> 30:45.303
Does this mean
the commander-in-chief has agreed?

30:46.504 --> 30:47.504
Thank you, sir.

30:48.063 --> 30:49.343
Who is your uncle?

30:49.944 --> 30:50.829
Go away from here!

30:52.863 --> 30:53.720
Of.

31:07.024 --> 31:10.024
Even though King Qin
extended his hand this time,

31:10.383 --> 31:11.583
Tentera Zhenxi

31:11.863 --> 31:13.343
still yearning for Changzhou.

31:13.504 --> 31:14.744
We need to be vigilant.

31:15.103 --> 31:16.143
He is the emperor's son.

31:16.200 --> 31:17.480
He came because he received orders.

31:17.760 --> 31:19.780
We cannot cooperate
with him so easily.

31:21.903 --> 31:22.823
Ying.

31:23.863 --> 31:25.543
There are many men in this world.

31:25.784 --> 31:28.063
Why do you admire him?

31:28.504 --> 31:29.383
Ayah.

31:30.464 --> 31:32.264
He is worth my admiration.

31:32.744 --> 31:35.103
It is difficult to predict the situation now.

31:35.320 --> 31:37.610
Even though Sun Jing lost,
he was still at the Tong Border.

31:37.704 --> 31:39.704
The three princes compete with each other.

31:40.024 --> 31:42.143
The King of Qin has great merit
and is easily overcome by problems.

31:42.264 --> 31:44.424
Although King Qin is unmatched,

31:44.664 --> 31:45.944
he is not an ideal partner.

31:48.543 --> 31:52.343
Ying, you need to think hard

31:53.063 --> 31:54.343
if you want to be with him.

32:02.424 --> 32:03.343
Ayah.

32:04.143 --> 32:05.464
I like Li Ni.

32:06.543 --> 32:08.063
He likes me too.

32:09.383 --> 32:10.464
Although

32:10.623 --> 32:12.424
there are many men in this world,

32:13.464 --> 32:15.303
he's the only one

32:16.583 --> 32:17.984
can capture my heart.

32:27.063 --> 32:29.143
I only have you as a child.

32:30.143 --> 32:31.810
Since
you've already thought about cooking

32:32.543 --> 32:33.903
and make decisions,

32:34.903 --> 32:37.264
I won't try to change your mind.

32:42.063 --> 32:43.143
Thank you dad.

32:50.343 --> 32:51.383
Mari.

32:51.504 --> 32:52.784
- Drink.
- Drink.

32:53.623 --> 32:55.310
The young lady is educated
and willing to fight.

32:55.664 --> 32:57.303
In fact,
she is the daughter of the great commander.

32:57.680 --> 32:58.464
In your opinion,

32:58.623 --> 32:59.583
who is worthy

32:59.704 --> 33:00.664
be his partner?

33:01.303 --> 33:02.224
In my opinion,

33:02.383 --> 33:03.383
The King of Qin suits.

33:03.623 --> 33:05.704
Since saving the emperor,

33:05.863 --> 33:08.343
King Qin led the Zhenxi Army
and never lost.

33:08.350 --> 33:09.160
Put other things aside.

33:09.170 --> 33:10.680
He is a rare commander-in-chief

33:10.784 --> 33:12.623
in the war on the Tong Border.

33:12.680 --> 33:13.744
Although King Qin was brilliant,

33:13.903 --> 33:15.543
he is the emperor's son.

33:15.704 --> 33:16.704
Miss

33:16.863 --> 33:18.704
should take a husband.

33:19.543 --> 33:20.184
That's right.

33:20.343 --> 33:21.583
She should take a husband.

33:21.704 --> 33:22.424
Mari.

33:22.543 --> 33:23.024
did you hear

33:23.143 --> 33:24.184
They think

33:24.303 --> 33:25.664
only i match you

33:26.264 --> 33:27.664
I just heard them say

33:27.784 --> 33:29.424
I should take my husband.

33:29.664 --> 33:31.024
As a prince,

33:31.070 --> 33:32.990
are you willing to marry
and live in the Cui Family?

33:33.003 --> 33:36.765
♪The sky is full of color♪

33:37.704 --> 33:39.343
The so-called Prince or King of Qin.

33:39.360 --> 33:41.280
I don't want to hold either of
these positions and I don't even care.

33:43.863 --> 33:46.543
Ying, let's go back to the Laolan Border.

33:46.823 --> 33:49.863
We got married there and gave birth to
seven or eight children.

33:49.870 --> 33:50.920
Half of them
go by your last name.

33:50.944 --> 33:51.910
Others go by my last name.

33:51.920 --> 33:53.010
I am not married
and you are not married.

33:53.024 --> 33:53.890
You don't marry
and I don't live in the Cui Residence.

33:53.903 --> 33:54.504
Good?

33:54.984 --> 33:56.224
Dream it.

33:56.230 --> 33:58.320
Who wants to give birth to seven
or eight children with you?

33:58.823 --> 33:59.903
Then, four people.

34:00.024 --> 34:01.343
At least four people.

34:01.350 --> 34:02.720
Two children
follow the surname Cui.

34:02.730 --> 34:03.784
Others go by the surname Li.

34:03.784 --> 34:04.200
What kind of?

34:04.224 --> 34:05.224
If you're bullshitting again,

34:05.383 --> 34:07.024
I will rip your mouth off.

34:07.184 --> 34:08.463
Do you want to tear my mouth?

34:08.863 --> 34:11.023
Of.

34:11.744 --> 34:12.664
Dream it.

34:14.254 --> 34:20.840
♪I miss you forever♪

34:22.320 --> 34:27.343

35:36.624 --> 35:37.863
It's been so long.

35:38.383 --> 35:40.784
Siege, pursuit,
contest of wisdom and courage.

35:41.104 --> 35:43.343
You manage to escape every time.

35:43.704 --> 35:44.823
Fortunately yesterday

35:44.943 --> 35:47.144
We didn't chase you
in Huayang Week on purpose

35:47.264 --> 35:48.624
so that you remember here is safe

35:49.064 --> 35:50.744
and we managed to surround you.

35:54.064 --> 35:55.023
Fifth Han.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.144
The governor respects you
for your obedience.

35:58.544 --> 36:00.624
As long as you hand over his great-grandson,

36:00.863 --> 36:02.463
you will not die

36:14.503 --> 36:17.303
Protect his great-grandson even if he dies!

Attack!

36:37.104 --> 36:38.943
Attack!

39:17.943 --> 39:21.264
Fifth Han!

39:42.064 --> 39:43.144
Governor.

39:54.383 --> 39:55.383
Li Xuanze.

39:55.823 --> 39:57.479
Say hello to the governor.

40:02.503 --> 40:05.144
You're the rebel who killed the emperor!

40:05.184 --> 40:05.503
Barbaric!

40:05.503 --> 40:06.104
Stop!

40:07.584 --> 40:08.784
Don't scare him.

40:35.264 --> 40:37.144
Han Chang
hid you for so long.

40:37.544 --> 40:39.023
At a critical moment,

40:39.184 --> 40:40.943
he still failed to protect you, didn't he?

40:45.943 --> 40:47.584
Even if he obeys,

40:47.784 --> 40:49.463
he could not resist the letter of destiny.

41:07.903 --> 41:08.573
Honourable.

41:08.704 --> 41:10.463
The letter to the King of Qin has been sent?

41:10.704 --> 41:12.064
Has been sent by speed horse.

41:12.320 --> 41:13.310
Don't worry, Your Highness.

41:13.440 --> 41:15.680
King Qin must have tried
to save his great-grandson.

41:15.983 --> 41:18.184
Although Sun Jin
managed to capture his great-grandson,

41:18.624 --> 41:19.544
I feel

41:19.784 --> 41:22.264
he wouldn't mind
his great-grandson so soon.

41:22.584 --> 41:24.823
May we still have time
to save his great-grandson.

41:25.224 --> 41:26.303
Commander Han has already spoken.

41:26.320 --> 41:27.480
He reorganized the rest of his army.

41:27.503 --> 41:29.210
He will try to
save his great-grandson as well.

41:29.224 --> 41:30.664
His great-grandson is blessed by God.

41:30.784 --> 41:32.064
He will definitely survive.

41:33.796 --> 41:34.771
(Dewan Chaoqian)

41:34.823 --> 41:36.343
Why my lord?

41:36.544 --> 41:37.704
sent down the order

41:37.744 --> 41:39.104
to rebuke King Qin?

41:40.720 --> 41:42.823
Beta ordered him to
Changzhou to solve the problem.

41:42.823 --> 41:43.943
He too

41:44.264 --> 41:45.343
forced beta

41:45.943 --> 41:47.463
bestow the title

41:47.470 --> 41:48.903
Panglima Besar Weiyang kepada Cui Yi.

41:49.184 --> 41:50.704
In fact, he said

41:51.544 --> 41:53.303
the Luoyang clause has become a reality

41:53.420 --> 41:54.744
and don't bring it up for a while.

41:55.584 --> 41:57.264
Itu Dongdu.

41:58.624 --> 42:00.423
He considered the affairs of the country

42:00.423 --> 42:01.664
as buying and selling.

42:02.264 --> 42:03.903
He also reported that

42:04.303 --> 42:05.943
after the Changzhou problem is solved,

42:06.144 --> 42:07.983
he and the Cui Family Army

42:08.023 --> 42:09.440
will go to recapture the Tong Border.

42:10.503 --> 42:13.423
The Cui Family Army was ambitious.

42:14.104 --> 42:15.104
What kind of

42:16.503 --> 42:18.423
if they colluded

42:18.423 --> 42:19.343
dengan Sun Jing?

42:19.660 --> 42:20.555
my lord

42:21.064 --> 42:23.544
This was agreed
in a meeting in the seri court.

42:23.744 --> 42:25.023
Considering Weiyang

42:25.064 --> 42:26.744
indeed in Cui Yi's jurisdiction,

42:26.823 --> 42:29.544
It is good that my lord
bestowed this title on him.

42:48.664 --> 42:50.423
Rumor has it, His Majesty issued an order

42:50.863 --> 42:52.144
to rebuke you.

42:53.264 --> 42:55.520
I already guessed that
your father would reprimand me,

42:55.784 --> 42:57.784
but I didn't think
this would happen so quickly.

42:58.544 --> 43:00.184
Even if you finish

43:00.320 --> 43:01.664
Changzhou problem without war,

43:01.720 --> 43:04.280
but the title of Grand Commander of Weiyang
was given to someone else.

43:04.290 --> 43:06.050
In fact, you promised
not to bring up Luoyang.

43:06.104 --> 43:07.584
Isn't this the title of the trial

43:08.224 --> 43:09.624
to your enemy in the draw?

43:10.184 --> 43:11.224
If I were them,

43:11.463 --> 43:13.303
I will criticize you too.

43:13.863 --> 43:14.704
You

43:14.903 --> 43:16.664
great service in the war.

43:16.903 --> 43:18.303
Most military officers

43:18.320 --> 43:19.970
in the hall series
comes from the Zhenxi Army.

43:19.983 --> 43:21.380
Of course
they will be on your side.

43:21.584 --> 43:23.023
If not,

43:23.144 --> 43:24.983
you are not just reprimanded.

43:25.264 --> 43:27.664
Instead, your position
as King of Qin will be stripped.

43:28.064 --> 43:28.983
I do not care.

43:30.463 --> 43:31.383
After all.

43:31.983 --> 43:33.463
After recapturing the Tong Border,

43:33.720 --> 43:35.110
I will return to the Laolan Border.

43:35.624 --> 43:38.744
It's better
than being bullied by people in the draw.

43:39.144 --> 43:40.940
Maybe you can't
go back to Laolan Border

43:41.104 --> 43:42.544
after recapturing the Tong Border.

43:42.704 --> 43:44.023
Not necessarily.

43:47.503 --> 43:48.264
Tuan Shiqi.

43:48.520 --> 43:50.144
There was an immediate report
from Concubine Xiao.

43:50.303 --> 43:52.184
He said, Sun Jing
had already held his great-grandson.

43:53.343 --> 43:53.983
What?

43:55.624 --> 43:57.423
Report!

43:58.120 --> 43:59.224
Immediate report from the Tong border.

43:59.704 --> 44:01.744
Sun Jing issued
a notice of rebellion

44:01.760 --> 44:03.200
at the Tong Border
in the name of his great-grandson.

44:04.224 --> 44:05.064
His great-grandson?

44:05.264 --> 44:05.823
Of.

44:06.420 --> 44:07.960
Rebel Sun has
found his great-grandson.

44:08.343 --> 44:09.664
In the notice,

44:10.544 --> 44:11.303
he criticized...

44:11.624 --> 44:12.503
Talk!

44:13.240 --> 44:14.880
He criticized my lord
the illegitimate emperor.

44:14.940 --> 44:16.420
and called for the army
that saved the emperor

44:16.584 --> 44:19.144
in the name of his great-grandson
to eliminate the illegitimate emperor

44:19.200 --> 44:20.520
so that his great-grandson can ascend the throne.

44:24.303 --> 44:24.943
Your father.

44:25.423 --> 44:27.064
Since Sun Jing was defeated and withdrew,

44:27.224 --> 44:28.784
he has no more effort.

44:29.023 --> 44:30.144
No one knows

44:30.200 --> 44:32.360
in case his great-grandson
is his real great-great-grandson.

44:32.463 --> 44:33.383
Patik suggested

44:33.560 --> 44:35.823
we find a boy
and claim that he is his great grandson.

44:35.943 --> 44:38.463
No one can distinguish
who is his real great-grandson.

44:39.983 --> 44:40.943
Honourable,

44:42.343 --> 44:44.503
Sun Jing dared to issue a notice,

44:44.664 --> 44:46.339
apparently he could prove
the boy's identity.

44:46.340 --> 44:48.100
If we look for
a fake great-grandson of his majesty,

44:48.104 --> 44:48.903
this will be

44:49.064 --> 44:50.624
people laugh

44:50.784 --> 44:53.544
and harm us?

44:54.383 --> 44:57.784
What is Sun Jing's evidence that can
prove the boy's identity?

44:58.144 --> 44:59.463
In Sun Jing's notice,

44:59.863 --> 45:01.264
His great-grandson brought

45:01.943 --> 45:03.264
seal of the late crown prince.

45:11.303 --> 45:11.983
my lord

45:12.320 --> 45:14.880
Sun Jing questioned the legitimacy
of this kingdom in the name of his great-grandson.

45:14.903 --> 45:16.624
This is unforgivable.

45:17.104 --> 45:17.983
Now,

45:18.144 --> 45:19.920
whether his great-grandson
is true or not,

45:19.930 --> 45:22.110
we should send an army
to fight against Sun Jing,

45:22.303 --> 45:24.624
restore
the Tong Border and his great-grandson.

45:25.120 --> 45:25.863
In my opinion,

45:25.943 --> 45:27.903
King Qin once
recaptured the Tong Border

45:28.343 --> 45:30.184
and fought with
Sun Jing repeatedly.

45:30.340 --> 45:32.784
Furthermore, King Qin proposed
to crack down on the Sun Rebels.

45:32.943 --> 45:34.664
So, King of Qin

45:34.823 --> 45:37.503
the most suitable candidate
to go to war.

45:42.463 --> 45:46.584
In that case, order the King of Qin
to lead the army

45:47.320 --> 45:49.960
go fight the Sun Rebels
and recapture the Tong Border.

45:51.544 --> 45:53.144
Doesn't he love to fight?

45:53.983 --> 45:56.264
This time, he can
fight to his heart's content.

45:56.423 --> 45:57.142
(Boundary Barrel)

45:57.184 --> 45:58.850
Sun Jing issued
a notice of rebellion

45:58.863 --> 46:01.463
to delay time on behalf of
the military forces attacking Baiyue.

46:01.463 --> 46:03.740
Actually, the strength of the army
defending the Tong Border is not enough.

46:03.863 --> 46:05.224
Do you have a plan?

46:05.224 --> 46:07.290
to take the opportunity
to attack into the Tong Border?

46:09.303 --> 46:11.110
How do you know
that I already have a plan?

46:12.144 --> 46:13.800
It's easy to defend the Tong Border,
but it's hard to attack it.

46:13.863 --> 46:15.383
However, you once attacked

46:15.420 --> 46:16.520
Bind border by force.

46:16.823 --> 46:18.423
Then, quite a while Zhenxi Army

46:18.430 --> 46:19.624
defending the Tong Border.

46:19.863 --> 46:20.943
According to your nature,

46:21.064 --> 46:22.383
you must be watching

46:22.503 --> 46:24.744
conditions outside and inside the boundary
carefully.

46:25.264 --> 46:25.943
Of.

46:26.423 --> 46:27.383
I left

46:27.664 --> 46:29.224
a secret passage in the Tong Border.

46:29.983 --> 46:30.943
Secret passage?

46:33.823 --> 46:35.224
Is it a ditch?

46:36.880 --> 46:37.784
How do you know?

46:39.520 --> 46:40.863
The texture of the soil Border Tong is hard.

46:40.920 --> 46:42.000
If you want to dig a tunnel,

46:42.064 --> 46:43.023
not easy either.

46:43.383 --> 46:44.463
So, this secret passage

46:44.624 --> 46:45.784
not newly built.

46:45.983 --> 46:47.184
It has been around for a long time

46:47.220 --> 46:48.503
and you can use it.

46:48.943 --> 46:50.624
As I remember, in the Ruijing Year,

46:50.784 --> 46:52.503
The Tong border
was once hit by a flash flood.

46:52.510 --> 46:54.010
The military armory was flooded with water.

46:54.120 --> 46:55.880
Then, the Ministry of Finance
allocates money

46:56.064 --> 46:57.863
to repair the ditch.

46:58.184 --> 46:59.983
The ditch was quite deep and wide.

47:00.184 --> 47:01.440
It feels like people can move inside.

47:02.343 --> 47:04.584
You know about

47:04.584 --> 47:05.620
the affairs of the Ministry of Finance
in the Year of Ruijing?

47:06.064 --> 47:06.784
Childhood,

47:06.880 --> 47:08.303
I like to read with my father.

47:08.624 --> 47:09.383
In his reading room,

47:09.420 --> 47:10.700
besides books about the military,

47:10.823 --> 47:12.144
there are also many files

47:12.303 --> 47:13.419
about repairs

47:13.420 --> 47:14.800
which is conducted at all borders.

47:14.863 --> 47:16.303
I read it as a story book.

47:16.360 --> 47:17.500
I remember it after reading.

47:19.624 --> 47:20.823
Tonight...

47:20.983 --> 47:21.800
Tonight, King of Qin

47:21.863 --> 47:23.784
will be rats
that infiltrate the ditch.

47:23.820 --> 47:25.110
Of course I have to accompany you.

47:25.463 --> 47:27.624
I will await
your instructions outside the city.
