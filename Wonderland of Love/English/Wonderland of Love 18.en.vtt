02:11.180 --> 02:11.790
Lieutenant.

02:12.390 --> 02:12.790
Please.

02:37.550 --> 02:38.460
Shu.

02:40.510 --> 02:41.420
Shu.

02:45.990 --> 02:46.580
Young Master!

02:48.770 --> 02:49.860
Young Master, you are awake.

02:50.600 --> 02:51.990
Young master, you are finally awake.

02:55.570 --> 02:56.420
Where is the lieutenant?

02:56.740 --> 02:57.620
Lieutenant is fine.

02:58.110 --> 02:59.300
Lieutenant is really fine.

02:59.750 --> 03:02.070
I SAW the Zhenxi army
rushing across the top of the mountain.

03:02.230 --> 03:03.390
I'm sure they saved her.

03:03.920 --> 03:05.490
Young Master, you need
rest and recovery.

03:06.270 --> 03:08.110
We still have to see Lieutenant He
when we get back.

03:17.990 --> 03:18.270
Here.

03:24.670 --> 03:27.110
(Which)

03:28.500 --> 03:31.490
(Zhenxi)

03:38.740 --> 03:39.140
General.

03:58.270 --> 03:58.900
Great General.

04:01.140 --> 04:02.180
I'm glad you're back.

04:20.300 --> 04:21.110
Mr. Qin,

04:22.300 --> 04:25.030
I have told my men to send
Lord Xin and Lord Qi back to your camp.

04:25.470 --> 04:26.620
As for your father,

04:27.230 --> 04:28.420
since you are already here,

04:29.150 --> 04:30.860
you can pick it up later.

04:32.450 --> 04:34.110
Great General Cui, you have
a kind heart.

04:35.030 --> 04:36.350
I am eternally grateful to you.

04:39.230 --> 04:39.820
Mr. Qin,

04:40.030 --> 04:41.590
since you are already in my camp,

04:43.220 --> 04:44.940
Why don't we talk privately
inside the tent?

04:48.940 --> 04:49.420
Clear.

04:49.620 --> 04:50.590
I was planning to do it too.

04:52.030 --> 04:53.670
Finally we return.

04:54.260 --> 04:56.060
You have finally seen the Great General again.

04:56.500 --> 04:57.860
My father has become thinner.

04:58.500 --> 04:59.300
Don't worry.

04:59.790 --> 05:02.230
I looked at the Great General's face
right now.

05:02.420 --> 05:03.710
I'm sure it's as healthy as ever.

05:03.910 --> 05:05.790
Lieutenant, don't worry about him.

05:07.110 --> 05:07.910
Lieutenant,

05:08.710 --> 05:10.060
Aren't you worried at all?

05:11.150 --> 05:11.940
Worried about what?

05:12.030 --> 05:14.110
This is the Cui Army camp.

05:14.380 --> 05:16.910
Li Ni doesn't dare to
do anything with Father.

05:17.350 --> 05:18.550
That's not what I mean.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.300
From

05:20.420 --> 05:21.620
you're not worried

05:21.720 --> 05:23.500
Great General could
you do something about Lord Qin?

05:24.150 --> 05:24.940
Ves,

05:25.150 --> 05:27.110
Great General could have
set up an ambush

05:27.150 --> 05:28.790
before inviting Lord Qin into his tent.

05:29.110 --> 05:30.180
Once you're inside,

05:30.230 --> 05:31.230
will give the order to kill

05:31.350 --> 05:32.350
crushing the cup.

05:32.710 --> 05:33.820
Don't worry.

05:33.860 --> 05:34.620
That will not happen.

05:36.910 --> 05:37.710
Lieutenant,

05:37.990 --> 05:39.350
you trust Lord Qin

05:39.550 --> 05:41.300
or the Great General both

05:41.350 --> 05:42.940
so you can be so sure about it?

05:45.060 --> 05:47.500
I trust none of them.

05:50.060 --> 05:51.420
That pin,

05:52.420 --> 05:54.500
Mr. Qin, why do you have it with you?

05:55.820 --> 05:57.060
Miss Cui gave it to me.

05:59.500 --> 06:00.820
Mr. Qin,

06:01.550 --> 06:02.420
do you think that

06:02.620 --> 06:04.260
can you act brazen about it?

06:07.620 --> 06:09.020
Great General Cui, you misunderstood me.

06:09.220 --> 06:10.590
I escorted Miss Cui back here today

06:10.910 --> 06:11.940
because I have

06:12.150 --> 06:13.590
urgent matters to discuss with you.

06:20.300 --> 06:23.300
Mr. Qin, you wish to borrow
the strength of the Cui army

06:26.150 --> 06:27.990
to claim Xichang, right?

06:30.500 --> 06:31.940
Mr. Qin, you blackmailed me

06:32.010 --> 06:33.180
with your letter previous to this one.

06:34.180 --> 06:36.590
Today, he even
accompanied my daughter back.

06:37.350 --> 06:39.300
Mr. Qin, I assume that

06:40.670 --> 06:42.470
you think I don't dare

06:42.620 --> 06:44.110
decapitarte, ¿eh?

06:48.670 --> 06:49.590
However,

06:51.150 --> 06:53.420
I trust both at the same time.

06:53.860 --> 06:55.420
What kind of enigma was that?

06:55.420 --> 06:56.480
I don't understand at all.

06:56.710 --> 06:58.300
Why are you so anxious?

06:59.500 --> 07:00.710
I almost forgot.

07:01.060 --> 07:02.990
Is Xie Chang'er here too?

07:03.150 --> 07:04.260
Are you worried that

07:04.260 --> 07:05.670
the great General could kill Lord Qin

07:05.860 --> 07:07.990
and his followers too, right?

07:08.350 --> 07:09.180
Lieutenant,

07:09.420 --> 07:10.500
I'm seriously.

07:10.500 --> 07:12.030
You always bother me.

07:19.380 --> 07:20.300
Great General!

07:20.860 --> 07:21.470
¡Padre!

07:22.470 --> 07:23.710
It's time to eat.

07:24.030 --> 07:25.710
Try the noodles I made for you.

07:26.470 --> 07:27.350
It's delicious.

07:31.350 --> 07:32.110
Yeah,

07:33.350 --> 07:34.590
why didn't you ask me

07:34.940 --> 07:36.260
Where has Lord Qin gone?

07:39.620 --> 07:41.230
Father, don't tell me

07:41.470 --> 07:43.300
Do you want to kill Lord Qin?

07:44.590 --> 07:45.590
He arrested my daughter

07:45.740 --> 07:47.110
and he blackmailed me with his letter.

07:47.550 --> 07:48.940
Shouldn't I kill him then?

07:50.300 --> 07:51.470
Padre,

07:51.550 --> 07:52.820
you arrested your two brothers

07:52.910 --> 07:53.940
and also his father.

07:54.450 --> 07:55.790
This is why Lord Qin has no choice.

07:55.860 --> 07:57.940
but walk me back
without fighting.

07:58.180 --> 07:59.260
Even now.

07:59.320 --> 08:00.360
Now that I think about it,

08:00.470 --> 08:02.030
you get a better deal.

08:02.670 --> 08:03.670
I wanted to ask you this.

08:04.350 --> 08:06.420
Why did you give Lord Qin
the hair pin to your mother ?

08:06.500 --> 08:07.860
I leave you?

08:09.670 --> 08:10.710
It's because he won a bet.

08:10.710 --> 08:12.420
That was my reward for him.

08:12.500 --> 08:13.590
What kind of bet?

08:13.590 --> 08:14.550
What kind of bet is so valuable

08:14.550 --> 08:17.350
that you are using the sakeepsake
your mother left you as a reward?

08:18.470 --> 08:19.820
Father, it is so.

08:19.940 --> 08:21.550
Back then, when we were in Bingzhou,

08:21.670 --> 08:23.420
Han Li fell with us.

08:23.740 --> 08:24.790
Both Li Ni and I

08:24.860 --> 08:26.350
They were in danger.

08:26.710 --> 08:27.470
Therefore,

08:27.550 --> 08:28.710
We made a bet.

08:28.910 --> 08:30.110
The winner of the bet

08:30.120 --> 08:32.110
you will receive the other person's help
to escape

08:32.110 --> 08:33.470
the place successfully.

08:33.620 --> 08:36.140
The loser will stay in Bingzhou
as backup.

08:36.780 --> 08:37.780
Li Ni lost the bet.

08:37.950 --> 08:38.710
Therefore,

08:38.860 --> 08:40.470
He helped me escape first.

08:40.710 --> 08:42.540
My dear ones

08:42.620 --> 08:43.710
As a reward.

08:43.990 --> 08:44.660
Without sense.

08:44.780 --> 08:46.230
You won the bet, right?

08:46.380 --> 08:48.020
Why did you give him a reward?

08:50.500 --> 08:51.540
Could be

08:52.500 --> 08:54.990
that he lost you on purpose?

08:55.710 --> 08:56.950
Padre.

08:57.500 --> 08:58.230
Yeah,

08:58.950 --> 09:00.540
Do not let that fool you.

09:01.470 --> 09:02.950
Why would I let you know

09:03.020 --> 09:04.310
if you lost it on purpose

09:04.470 --> 09:06.020
so you can escape safely?

09:07.620 --> 09:08.860
Padre,

09:09.470 --> 09:11.260
do you think your daughter is so stupid?

09:12.540 --> 09:13.830
It's hard to say.

09:14.230 --> 09:16.260
Maybe she went crazy
suddenly.

09:17.020 --> 09:17.830
Anyway,

09:18.070 --> 09:19.660
this chest fooled my daughter

09:19.780 --> 09:21.350
and even trapped her in Taiqing Palace.

09:21.780 --> 09:22.740
It's despicable.

09:22.820 --> 09:23.350
It's true.

09:23.620 --> 09:24.540
It's despicable.

09:27.020 --> 09:28.230
Li Ni

09:28.500 --> 09:30.230
It's finally in my hands now.

09:30.660 --> 09:31.590
I will kill him

09:32.140 --> 09:34.350
to vent.

09:34.780 --> 09:37.780
Now, Dongdu is
under the control of the Cui Army.

09:37.900 --> 09:39.260
Once we claim Xichang,

09:39.590 --> 09:41.310
Peace will be restored to the world.

09:42.520 --> 09:44.140
The wish you made
when you left Yingzhou,

09:44.260 --> 09:45.260
what was for the people

09:45.350 --> 09:47.070
lead a peaceful life,

09:47.590 --> 09:48.950
It will soon be done.

09:51.830 --> 09:52.470
Padre,

09:52.740 --> 09:54.410
If you kill Li Ni right now,

09:54.500 --> 09:55.650
people will not be able

09:55.740 --> 09:57.100
live in peace.

09:58.410 --> 10:00.010
You didn't say that

10:00.140 --> 10:01.410
when they were in Yingzhou.

10:02.010 --> 10:04.260
You said that the imperial Li Family
was incompetent.

10:04.380 --> 10:06.530
Only those who were capable
should rule the world.

10:08.260 --> 10:09.380
At that time,

10:09.580 --> 10:11.260
He still didn't know Li Ni.

10:12.500 --> 10:13.050
Padre,

10:13.260 --> 10:14.260
listen.

10:14.770 --> 10:15.860
Li Ni.

10:15.980 --> 10:17.170
Comes from Laolan Pass.

10:17.340 --> 10:18.380
Excels in battles.

10:18.740 --> 10:19.860
The strangest thing about him

10:20.010 --> 10:21.290
It's not utilitarian.

10:21.360 --> 10:22.810
He just wants to quell the rebellion

10:22.930 --> 10:24.380
and return to his step.

10:25.290 --> 10:27.580
He is someone who can bear
great responsibilities

10:27.770 --> 10:30.380
with a benevolent heart.

10:30.930 --> 10:31.860
A person like him

10:31.980 --> 10:33.220
he is the best ruler

10:33.380 --> 10:34.410
after the ravages of war.

10:34.690 --> 10:35.580
But,

10:35.690 --> 10:37.260
the world will fall into chaos again

10:37.380 --> 10:39.100
It doesn't matter who ascended the throne.

10:41.260 --> 10:43.220
You have always been a proud person.

10:44.010 --> 10:45.500
I never thought that you

10:45.690 --> 10:47.530
Li Ni would like it so much.

10:49.140 --> 10:50.530
I have already killed him.

10:51.220 --> 10:52.740
Don't mention it again.

10:54.550 --> 10:55.290
I do not trust you.

10:55.770 --> 10:57.290
Father, you will never kill him.

10:57.980 --> 10:58.770
Because you said so?

10:59.580 --> 11:01.220
It's because I know you well.

11:01.500 --> 11:03.860
No matter how much you hate it,

11:03.880 --> 11:05.520
you have to wait
until we claim Xichang

11:05.530 --> 11:06.620
before you burn your bridges

11:06.740 --> 11:07.620
and kill him.

11:11.460 --> 11:12.810
So according to you,

11:14.290 --> 11:15.690
we should keep lord qin alive

11:16.980 --> 11:18.290
as it is still useful to us.

11:18.410 --> 11:19.860
Clear.

11:28.460 --> 11:29.010
Padre.

11:34.010 --> 11:34.460
Hurry up.

11:34.580 --> 11:35.460
My daughter told me

11:35.740 --> 11:37.010
you are still useful to us.

11:37.220 --> 11:38.380
For now I won't kill you.

11:38.740 --> 11:39.810
You're stupid?

11:39.930 --> 11:41.930
You must flee
if you cannot defeat my father.

11:42.260 --> 11:43.620
Do you like it when he ties you up

11:43.690 --> 11:44.530
and put you in a box?

11:45.100 --> 11:46.530
It's not that I can't defeat him.

11:51.220 --> 11:52.500
I mean, I can't defeat him.

11:53.860 --> 11:54.980
Still, I can't just escape.

11:55.500 --> 11:56.860
I had hope

11:57.220 --> 11:58.110
that the Great General Cui

11:58.530 --> 11:59.530
can help the Zhenxi army

11:59.650 --> 12:00.740
reclamar Xichang.

12:02.290 --> 12:04.140
So, father, you promised Lord Qin

12:04.260 --> 12:06.140
to claim
Xichang with him?

12:07.170 --> 12:07.980
Thanks, Dad!

12:08.620 --> 12:10.100
Now, you don't have to worry.

12:10.380 --> 12:12.050
You don't need to encourage me to eat.

12:12.170 --> 12:14.500
Your noodles must have been worn out by now.

12:14.740 --> 12:16.530
I'll make you another dish right away!

12:37.580 --> 12:38.690
Slows down.

12:42.220 --> 12:43.620
Take your time.

12:46.650 --> 12:47.410
Alright?

12:48.530 --> 12:49.100
Yeah.

12:53.260 --> 12:54.810
Did the rope do this to you?

12:56.320 --> 12:58.000
Alright. I'll be fine
after a few days.

12:58.580 --> 12:59.810
You're so stupid.

13:00.120 --> 13:02.510
A small punishment is fine, but
you should run away when it is serious.

13:02.650 --> 13:03.740
You are an adult.

13:03.810 --> 13:06.650
You were tied and trapped in the box
for an unknown amount of time.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.520
Aren't you afraid that
you might get hurt?

13:10.140 --> 13:11.140
It wasn't that long.

13:11.980 --> 13:12.860
Ves,

13:12.980 --> 13:14.260
before entering,

13:14.580 --> 13:16.140
great General said

13:16.650 --> 13:18.740
Could you send your troops
and help me claim

13:18.930 --> 13:19.410
xichang,

13:19.980 --> 13:21.460
However, you have to tie me down

13:21.530 --> 13:22.380
and keep me in a box.

13:22.580 --> 13:23.770
Everything depended on your will.

13:24.650 --> 13:25.890
If you want to die,

13:26.120 --> 13:27.600
He wouldn't need to send his troops.

13:27.690 --> 13:29.580
He would cut off my head immediately.

13:29.890 --> 13:30.860
However, if you want

13:30.860 --> 13:31.980
to keep me alive,

13:32.040 --> 13:35.110
He promised me that he would send his troops
and helped me reclaim Xichang.

13:35.860 --> 13:37.580
are you so sure

13:37.690 --> 13:39.260
that he didn't want you dead?

13:39.770 --> 13:42.010
What if I tricked you into escorting me?

13:42.140 --> 13:43.620
to the main camp of the Cui Army

13:43.740 --> 13:45.010
so I could seek my revenge?

13:45.410 --> 13:47.010
Trapped me in Taiqing Palace

13:47.100 --> 13:48.140
for a long time after all.

13:49.170 --> 13:49.890
Are you mad at me?

13:50.010 --> 13:51.170
Clear.

13:51.720 --> 13:53.270
Did you really hold a grudge?

13:53.650 --> 13:54.530
Naturally.

13:58.360 --> 13:59.720
If so, it would not be enough

13:59.740 --> 14:00.980
if you just asked your father

14:01.170 --> 14:02.340
cut off my head

14:06.620 --> 14:07.500
I have an idea.

14:08.010 --> 14:08.930
What idea?

14:09.500 --> 14:10.100
Ya ves,

14:11.340 --> 14:12.650
a life is a long time.

14:13.170 --> 14:14.610
From now on, why don't you torture me

14:14.860 --> 14:16.140
and organize myself around

14:16.260 --> 14:17.140
every day?

14:17.850 --> 14:19.210
You can free me from your frustrations

14:19.220 --> 14:20.290
every time you feel it.

14:21.100 --> 14:21.930
I think that

14:22.290 --> 14:23.340
is more suitable.

14:23.690 --> 14:24.400
What do you think?

14:25.260 --> 14:27.050
You just want.

14:30.340 --> 14:31.500
I wish for that to happen.

14:46.580 --> 14:47.380
What should I do?

14:48.740 --> 14:51.010
What should I say?

15:06.770 --> 15:07.290
¿ Taozi?

15:08.340 --> 15:08.770
Eat it.

15:12.220 --> 15:13.220
What's the matter?

15:13.690 --> 15:15.690
you were walking around

15:15.770 --> 15:17.340
like a cat on a hot tin roof.

15:19.980 --> 15:20.860
Don't worry.

15:21.100 --> 15:22.410
I have already consulted Lord Qin.

15:22.650 --> 15:24.100
You're safe.

15:24.190 --> 15:25.500
is eating together

15:25.620 --> 15:27.010
lieutenant He in his tent now.

15:28.340 --> 15:29.410
Actually,

15:30.620 --> 15:32.220
actually, it was not because of Lord Qin.

15:33.260 --> 15:34.460
Wasn't it because of Lord Qin?

15:34.890 --> 15:35.930
What happens then?

15:37.460 --> 15:38.050
Yo...

15:40.010 --> 15:40.930
I was afraid

15:44.120 --> 15:46.100
I was afraid of not being able
to see you again.

15:55.860 --> 15:57.890
You want to see me every day, huh?

16:02.500 --> 16:03.220
However,

16:03.890 --> 16:05.340
We will part soon.

16:06.410 --> 16:07.620
And, a war comes.

16:08.500 --> 16:09.500
What happens if I get hurt?

16:09.770 --> 16:10.260
o...

16:13.410 --> 16:15.050
No one will tell you anyway.

16:16.220 --> 16:17.100
it's possible

16:18.640 --> 16:20.200
I won't see you again after this.

16:20.650 --> 16:21.980
What nonsense are you talking?

16:22.930 --> 16:23.930
You will not be injured.

16:24.140 --> 16:25.050
You didn't listen to nonsense.

16:27.120 --> 16:27.690
You're right.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.110
I have the medicine you gave me.

16:29.140 --> 16:30.410
It's okay even if I get injured.

16:31.930 --> 16:32.930
What a stupid guy.

16:33.810 --> 16:35.260
Eat it. It's getting cold.

16:37.740 --> 16:38.690
You need to be careful

16:38.810 --> 16:39.890
when you fight in war.

16:39.900 --> 16:41.570
Don't think that
you are going to get injured.

16:46.260 --> 16:46.770
He is so cute!

16:49.930 --> 16:50.930
Slows down.

16:54.580 --> 16:55.810
The doctor said that

16:55.830 --> 16:57.300
I must not let yourself exaggerate.

16:58.140 --> 16:58.930
I do not know

16:59.050 --> 17:00.340
whether Ying is safe or not.

17:00.860 --> 17:02.290
How can I wait?

17:03.120 --> 17:04.850
However, you have not
fully recovered yet.

17:05.100 --> 17:07.580
You're hurting yourself
by running like that.

17:08.170 --> 17:09.930
Look at the markings on the road.

17:10.380 --> 17:12.020
Cui's army is nearby.

17:12.450 --> 17:14.060
I have to go back to camp today.

17:14.320 --> 17:15.860
I can only rest easy when I see Ying.

17:18.520 --> 17:19.100
Young master,

17:19.720 --> 17:21.110
Lieutenant He is blessed by the heavens.

17:21.300 --> 17:22.450
I'm sure it's fine.

17:26.580 --> 17:27.300
Young Master!

17:28.490 --> 17:30.210

17:50.020 --> 17:50.580
Yeah,

17:51.920 --> 17:53.100
I can't bear to part with you.

17:56.540 --> 17:57.860
Why don't you stay then?

18:00.620 --> 18:01.650
Wanna

18:02.410 --> 18:03.580
to bring you with me.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.820
But I fear that Great General Cui

18:06.100 --> 18:07.140
won't accept it.

18:08.690 --> 18:10.380
You and your desires.

18:12.580 --> 18:13.580

18:43.380 --> 18:43.690

18:44.890 --> 18:46.100
Isn't that a lieutenant?

18:46.930 --> 18:47.730
Yeah.

18:49.730 --> 18:50.930
can keep you company

18:51.100 --> 18:52.170
as long as he's not around.

18:52.690 --> 18:53.690

27:29.580 --> 27:30.650
I beg you.

27:31.170 --> 27:32.620
Can you kill me please?

27:33.490 --> 27:34.540
Just kill me.

27:36.020 --> 27:38.060
A shadow abandoned by its master

27:38.860 --> 27:40.170
he deserves to die.

27:42.060 --> 27:43.380
I deserve to die.

27:45.930 --> 27:47.650
There is a way to maintain life.

27:49.340 --> 27:49.890
Rumor says that

27:50.060 --> 27:51.580
que la medicina divina en Jieshuo

27:51.620 --> 27:54.310
It can help even the sickest people
recover from their illness.

27:54.730 --> 27:55.450
young master,

27:55.970 --> 27:57.800
We will seek
divine medicine together.

28:01.620 --> 28:02.210
No.

28:05.340 --> 28:06.580
We shouldn't go there.

28:08.820 --> 28:10.690
The Cui and Jieshuo Army

28:11.540 --> 28:13.250
They are sworn enemies.

28:14.970 --> 28:18.300
Ying's mother died at the hands
of the Jieshuo people.

28:20.780 --> 28:21.820
I never go to

28:21.930 --> 28:23.100
seek their help.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.580
♪ Life and death mean nothing ♪

28:27.650 --> 28:28.580
Young master,

28:30.270 --> 28:32.210
You can only see Lieutenant Him
when you are alive.

28:32.870 --> 28:35.580
And hope she changes her mind
when you're alive.

28:35.690 --> 28:37.450
♪ Wait by your side ♪

28:37.540 --> 28:40.930
If you take divine medicine
and recover from your condition,

28:41.860 --> 28:43.100
maybe the lieutenant

28:43.450 --> 28:45.450
will be able to see
by then, Li Ni's true colors

28:46.120 --> 28:49.000
Maybe Lieutenant He will be able
to see how sincere you were towards her.

28:49.060 --> 28:50.490
By then she will change her mind.

28:51.860 --> 28:52.540
Ella...

28:56.140 --> 28:57.170
You're right.

28:57.220 --> 28:59.910
♪ If only I could appreciate
this momentary warmth ♪

29:01.410 --> 29:02.620

29:04.650 --> 29:06.620
I can only see Ying when I'm alive.

29:07.730 --> 29:09.820
I can only protect her when she is alive.

29:10.730 --> 29:12.060
If one day,

29:13.060 --> 29:14.780
I become healthy

29:15.790 --> 29:17.680
and I am able to kill enemies
on the battlefield,

29:18.380 --> 29:19.970
She will fall for me by then.

29:21.250 --> 29:21.930
Then,

29:22.100 --> 29:23.890
will stop falling for Li Ni.

29:26.380 --> 29:27.170
Then,

29:27.300 --> 29:28.820
ying will definitely fall for me.

29:29.620 --> 29:31.450
Ying will definitely fall for me.

29:32.450 --> 29:34.300
Ying will definitely fall for me.

29:36.210 --> 29:36.860
And!

29:37.540 --> 29:38.100
Yeah.

29:39.410 --> 29:39.970
By then,

29:40.140 --> 29:41.730
You will definitely fall for me.

30:02.780 --> 30:04.060
The weather is cold tonight.

30:04.780 --> 30:06.490
You should rest inside.

30:13.210 --> 30:14.170
At that time,

30:14.690 --> 30:16.620
I thought no one could rival me.

30:17.890 --> 30:19.380
Pei Xian was getting old

30:19.690 --> 30:21.580
while Cui Yi was being held
by Jieshuo.

30:22.690 --> 30:24.210
But now,

30:24.490 --> 30:26.140
Looks like I made the wrong move.

30:28.020 --> 30:29.490
Ya que Cui Yi ha reclamado a Dongdu

30:29.970 --> 30:32.450
He and Li Ni
are surely involved in a conflict.

30:33.250 --> 30:34.930
If he kills Lord Liang,
the false emperor,

30:35.340 --> 30:36.580
it will be

30:36.780 --> 30:38.380
Li Ni's sworn enemy by then.

30:40.620 --> 30:42.650
Even if they come to me together,

30:43.140 --> 30:44.580
we can have a show

30:44.930 --> 30:46.250
and see who has the last laugh.

30:53.060 --> 30:53.780
I told him.

30:54.860 --> 30:56.580
Lord Xin cannot defend a city

30:56.820 --> 30:58.100
with its capacity.

30:59.890 --> 31:01.250
Luckily, we would escape quickly.

31:01.490 --> 31:02.250
But,

31:02.450 --> 31:04.210
once uncle conquered Luoyang City,

31:04.820 --> 31:06.650
Who knows what will happen to us by then?

31:07.170 --> 31:08.060
Now that guy

31:08.170 --> 31:09.170
He has lost his son,

31:09.300 --> 31:10.490
I'm sure he's furious.

31:10.520 --> 31:11.870
He won't have time to take care of me.

31:14.140 --> 31:15.340
But this way,

31:15.450 --> 31:16.930
I am the only person

31:17.250 --> 31:19.340
who can inherit the assets of the Cui family.

31:19.860 --> 31:21.580
After all he is my uncle.

31:23.220 --> 31:26.010
What if the Great General finds out
that Young Master Cui was assaulted...

31:26.100 --> 31:27.410
It is impossible.

31:27.820 --> 31:29.930
All our men dressed up.

31:29.960 --> 31:31.410
Even if you investigate the case,

31:31.540 --> 31:33.380
can only find out

31:33.440 --> 31:34.580
which were Li Jun's men.

31:35.540 --> 31:36.300
But,

31:36.580 --> 31:38.380
how could he attack Luoyang City

31:38.540 --> 31:39.580
out of spite?

31:40.060 --> 31:42.100
If the Grand General interrogates Lord Xin,

31:42.250 --> 31:43.410
I'm afraid Lord Xin will...

31:43.410 --> 31:45.110
Even if he did
extract information from it,

31:45.210 --> 31:47.580
even if Li Jun revealed all the details,

31:48.350 --> 31:49.780
I would just take his mouth off.

31:49.790 --> 31:50.780
I would be spilling nonsense.

31:51.250 --> 31:52.580
Think about it.

31:52.860 --> 31:54.690
Not just Li Jun puso

31:54.860 --> 31:56.380
and kill his son,

31:56.580 --> 31:58.890
but it also drove a wedge
between my uncle and me.

31:59.380 --> 32:00.620
Why would the uncle trust him?

32:02.320 --> 32:03.980
You have served me
for so long.

32:04.100 --> 32:05.540
Can you use your brain for once?

32:06.450 --> 32:07.490
Yes sir.

32:07.890 --> 32:09.580
If yes, should we hide

32:09.730 --> 32:11.730
somewhere and see how the situation works?

32:14.580 --> 32:16.020
That's the only thing we can do.

32:17.780 --> 32:19.300
Master, it's...

32:19.420 --> 32:20.170
That's all we have!

32:20.340 --> 32:21.540
Do you still want to eat?

32:22.340 --> 32:23.140
What a glutton.

32:25.380 --> 32:26.170
Lieutenant,

32:27.140 --> 32:28.450
Lord Qin sent us a letter.

32:28.460 --> 32:29.790
He also had something good for you.

32:31.390 --> 32:31.930
Here you have.

32:39.300 --> 32:40.170
(The war is near.)

32:40.180 --> 32:41.610
(I suddenly remember
that you loved this.)

32:41.620 --> 32:43.110
(I have sent you this
to relieve your boredom.)

32:43.420 --> 32:45.680
(As the saying goes, chew delicately
like crushed jade,)

32:45.690 --> 32:47.300
(And take advantage of the momentum
like cutting bamboo.)

32:47.410 --> 32:49.020
(I hope to crush the enemy's morale.)

32:49.450 --> 32:51.730
(I wish you success,
and you can achieve victory.)

32:52.220 --> 32:53.370
(After returning to the capital,)

32:53.380 --> 32:54.910
(I'm willing to go for
dried fruit)

32:54.920 --> 32:56.910
(And enjoy the nuts there
in abundance.)

32:56.970 --> 32:59.100
(I will trust both flanks
and my rear wing)

32:59.410 --> 33:00.780
(and you.)

33:01.340 --> 33:03.620
(Send my gaze to Great General Cui.)

33:05.100 --> 33:05.730
Lieutenant,

33:05.930 --> 33:07.820
What did Lord Qin write in his letter?

33:08.540 --> 33:09.300
Wait to

33:09.450 --> 33:11.060
that we can achieve victory.

33:12.170 --> 33:13.450
So, he sent all this here

33:13.730 --> 33:15.860
as a sign of good luck?

33:16.860 --> 33:17.860
It's true.

33:17.970 --> 33:20.650
Disturbed Ear to deliver
these nuts all the way here

33:20.820 --> 33:22.450
to wish us luck.

33:24.450 --> 33:25.860
He delivers the nuts here

33:26.020 --> 33:27.690
It has nothing to do with me.

33:28.620 --> 33:31.300
You're being stubborn when you haven't had
these nuts, huh?

33:32.140 --> 33:32.970
Lieutenant.

33:33.540 --> 33:34.580
Eat it.

33:53.210 --> 33:53.860
Youde.

33:54.210 --> 33:54.890
What's happening?

33:57.380 --> 33:58.860
Mr. Shiqi, I can't accept it anymore!

33:59.350 --> 34:00.620
The Cui Army sold Tong Pass out of

34:00.780 --> 34:02.450
and caused the death
of many brothers!

34:02.620 --> 34:03.100
As we can

34:03.250 --> 34:05.510
form an alliance
and attack Xichang together with them?

34:05.510 --> 34:06.610
What if they betray us again?

34:06.620 --> 34:07.480
What should we do by then?

34:07.490 --> 34:08.250
That's right!

34:08.420 --> 34:09.020
What if

34:09.140 --> 34:10.020
they betray us

34:10.140 --> 34:11.420
and they surround us from behind?

34:11.810 --> 34:12.810
I met Cui Yi before.

34:13.290 --> 34:14.100
It will not.

34:14.330 --> 34:16.020
As a father, as a son.

34:16.170 --> 34:17.060
If your son did that,

34:17.210 --> 34:18.400
I'm sure his father would too!

34:19.120 --> 34:20.460
If Cui Yi was someone like that,

34:20.810 --> 34:22.370
He wouldn't let me leave Luoyang.

34:22.530 --> 34:24.310
He wouldn't let me
bring the Father back here.

34:26.370 --> 34:27.250
Señor Shiqi,

34:28.140 --> 34:28.850
You are sure that

34:28.880 --> 34:30.210
Can we still trust the Cui Army?

34:32.260 --> 34:34.460
The Zhenxi Army has entrusted
its flanks and rear wing

34:35.420 --> 34:36.580
us?

34:37.770 --> 34:40.100
It's because our army
is stronger than yours.

34:40.290 --> 34:41.810
That's why they trusted their flanks

34:41.980 --> 34:43.100
and rear wing to us.

34:43.980 --> 34:46.420
Li Ni is bold indeed.

34:46.980 --> 34:47.580
I don't fear him

34:47.730 --> 34:49.140
that could cut your retirement

34:49.580 --> 34:51.940
and they caught him in Xichang, huh?

34:53.250 --> 34:54.500
Father, will you do it?

34:57.500 --> 34:58.140
I trust them.

35:00.170 --> 35:01.290
If Mr. Shiqi trusts them,

35:01.530 --> 35:02.330
I will trust them too.

35:02.620 --> 35:03.290
I trust them too.

35:04.770 --> 35:06.170
Mr. Shiqi, I trust you.

35:07.730 --> 35:09.060
Yes that's how it is,

35:10.100 --> 35:11.460
I will also trust Mr. Shiqi.

35:16.060 --> 35:16.650
you,

35:17.420 --> 35:18.330
do you trust me?

35:21.460 --> 35:22.980
Of course I trust you.

35:24.540 --> 35:25.650
Thanks for trusting me.

35:29.330 --> 35:29.730
Ven.

35:35.580 --> 35:36.980
Once we claim Xichang,

35:37.540 --> 35:39.170
Let's roast a whole lamb together.

35:39.420 --> 35:40.500
Forget the sheep.

35:40.670 --> 35:41.580
We have to have liquid.

35:41.940 --> 35:43.540
It's true. We need to have liquor.

35:44.250 --> 35:45.060
Greetings.

35:45.170 --> 35:47.210
- Come on.
- Greetings!

35:49.060 --> 35:50.690
I would have tried it a long time ago

35:50.850 --> 35:52.250
if it were not for you.

35:52.540 --> 35:53.500
Padre,

35:53.980 --> 35:55.020
you would not do that.

35:57.210 --> 35:58.020
Nevertheless,

35:58.850 --> 36:00.020
even if the Cui Army

36:00.170 --> 36:01.500
and the Zhenxi Army

36:01.980 --> 36:04.170
have more soldiers than
Sun Jing's garrison,

36:05.500 --> 36:06.770
it is easy to defend Xichang

36:07.100 --> 36:08.580
It is difficult to attack.

36:09.250 --> 36:11.170
Although Li Ni is anathema,

36:11.690 --> 36:13.290
He doesn't seem like a reckless person.

36:16.850 --> 36:18.420
Have you made other arrangements

36:18.650 --> 36:19.900
in the city?

36:20.420 --> 36:21.730
So Father, you found out.

36:22.100 --> 36:24.140
Actually, Li Ni already sent his men into the city

36:24.290 --> 36:27.460
and secretly spread rumors
a few days ago

36:27.480 --> 36:28.690
to make people panic

36:28.850 --> 36:30.020
and compete for food.

36:30.540 --> 36:32.460
Now, people are panicking.

36:32.520 --> 36:33.470
Once we attack the city,

36:33.580 --> 36:34.420
the city

36:34.540 --> 36:35.650
will fall into chaos.

36:36.100 --> 36:37.500
and I predict

36:37.650 --> 36:39.100
that will burn down the barn

36:39.250 --> 36:41.210
or steal food.

36:41.670 --> 36:44.140
Once the city is in chaos
and there is no food in the granary,

36:44.250 --> 36:46.650
The soldiers guarding
the city will die of hunger.

36:47.100 --> 36:49.730
This way, attacking the city
will be much easier.

36:51.370 --> 36:52.580
Really?

36:52.730 --> 36:53.370
What's happening?

36:53.730 --> 36:54.900
Father, do you think

36:55.330 --> 36:56.940
Is that arrangement inappropriate?

36:58.060 --> 37:00.170
Li Ni may look young, but he is mature.

37:01.020 --> 37:03.100
You probably have one more ace
up your sleeve.

37:03.470 --> 37:05.900
And, it's likely that your plan
will be the nail in the coffin.

37:06.770 --> 37:08.460
Burning down the barn

37:08.650 --> 37:10.290
and disturb the peace of the people

37:11.250 --> 37:13.290
They are not good enough.

37:15.420 --> 37:16.650
Actually, I also predict

37:17.000 --> 37:18.540
who has another ace up his sleeve.

37:19.020 --> 37:20.100
Nevertheless,

37:20.370 --> 37:21.980
I can not tell

37:22.210 --> 37:23.980
what's on your mind for now.

37:25.810 --> 37:27.540
Now, I feel like I understand

37:28.290 --> 37:28.900
because

37:28.980 --> 37:30.460
you fell next to him.

37:30.940 --> 37:31.650
Padre,

37:31.810 --> 37:33.900
We are talking about
official business here.

37:34.250 --> 37:36.210
He was not as bold and meticulous as him

37:36.420 --> 37:38.170
when I was your age

37:38.420 --> 37:39.810
even though I compromised Jieshuo

37:39.940 --> 37:41.140
in numerous battles

37:41.290 --> 37:42.140
back then.

37:42.290 --> 37:43.900
Father, how could I compare you?

37:44.100 --> 37:45.060
Era

37:45.210 --> 37:46.370
just luck.

37:47.620 --> 37:50.560
He was not proud or arrogant even
though he was from the imperial family.

37:51.570 --> 37:53.450
Participated in several battles
from Laolan Pass

37:53.460 --> 37:54.460
so far.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.430
He intends to reclaim his lost empire,

37:56.580 --> 37:57.940
and is protected by a large army.

37:58.900 --> 38:00.290
Is more than

38:00.460 --> 38:02.100
just luck.

38:02.120 --> 38:03.600
Father, you are praising him too much.

38:03.620 --> 38:04.460
I think that

38:04.620 --> 38:05.060
does not deserve

38:05.210 --> 38:06.580
He deserves all those praises.

38:07.170 --> 38:07.900
Since they praised him

38:08.100 --> 38:09.330
for my daughter,

38:09.540 --> 38:10.290
naturally,

38:10.460 --> 38:11.580
He also deserves my praise.

38:12.210 --> 38:14.810
If so, father, will you stop hitting him
in the future?

38:16.290 --> 38:17.330
I said that

38:17.650 --> 38:19.170
He was good at war.

38:19.180 --> 38:20.920
But when it comes to
marrying my daughter,

38:22.140 --> 38:22.920
You can dream about it.

38:22.920 --> 38:23.920
You're saying it again.

38:33.730 --> 38:36.060
Lord Qin is going
to attack the city soon.

38:37.140 --> 38:39.250
¿ No dijeron al General Pingliang,
cui Yi,

38:39.460 --> 38:40.540
conquer Dongdu?

38:41.210 --> 38:43.330
That is Lord Qin's strength.

38:43.850 --> 38:46.420
No just god to Cui Yi
a generous don,

38:46.730 --> 38:48.620
que era Dongdu,

38:48.810 --> 38:50.290
but also convinced

38:50.460 --> 38:51.460
the Cui army to join him

38:51.620 --> 38:53.540
in conquering Xichang.

38:53.980 --> 38:54.690
Padre,

38:55.500 --> 38:58.100
say: “Do you think Lord Qin
will achieve success?

38:58.220 --> 39:00.490
On the surface, it seems that he is going
to attack Xichang

39:00.500 --> 39:01.620
along with the Cui Army.

39:01.770 --> 39:02.900
However, I'm sure it did

39:03.060 --> 39:04.810
other secret plans.

39:05.370 --> 39:06.460
I just don't know

39:06.620 --> 39:08.210
what are your plans

39:08.420 --> 39:09.850
and how to support it.

39:10.060 --> 39:10.810
Prime Minister!

39:12.460 --> 39:14.370
We are in trouble!

39:14.380 --> 39:15.540
Has Lord Qin attacked the city?

39:15.540 --> 39:17.650
Some troublemakers have broken into the barn.

39:17.810 --> 39:19.770
They robbed the barn!

39:19.940 --> 39:20.850
The guards there

39:21.020 --> 39:22.140
They couldn't stop them.

39:22.150 --> 39:23.270
After that, for some reason,

39:23.330 --> 39:24.370
The barn caught fire.

39:24.540 --> 39:26.500
It was raided and burned.

39:26.650 --> 39:27.460
I fear that

39:27.620 --> 39:28.670
there's not much left.

39:28.770 --> 39:29.770
Very good. I understand.

39:29.980 --> 39:30.620
You can go.

39:30.810 --> 39:32.500
Order our men to guard the door.

39:32.650 --> 39:33.100
Yeah.

39:35.170 --> 39:35.980
Wan'niang,

39:36.730 --> 39:37.770
now you understand?

39:38.220 --> 39:40.010
So, he was targeting the city
with his plans.

39:40.330 --> 39:40.940
It's true.

39:41.410 --> 39:42.460
First, he spread rumors of

39:42.580 --> 39:44.210
the lack of food in the city.

39:44.370 --> 39:45.770
It caused panic among the people.

39:45.980 --> 39:47.620
After that, he instigated the rioters

39:47.770 --> 39:50.140
rob and burn the barn.

39:50.500 --> 39:51.290
Now,

39:51.460 --> 39:53.060
there is no food in the city.

39:53.370 --> 39:55.980
The soldiers guarding the city
will have to starve.

39:55.990 --> 39:57.760
I'm sure they're in no mood
to defend the city.

39:57.770 --> 39:58.540
It's true.

39:59.060 --> 40:01.210
Now, Lord Liang has proclaimed himself
emperor.

40:01.370 --> 40:02.650
Sun Jing was known as a tyrant.

40:02.810 --> 40:04.330
And, the city is in chaos.

40:04.500 --> 40:05.690
Xichang

40:06.020 --> 40:07.580
will fall.

40:36.820 --> 40:37.410
Your Highness!

40:40.420 --> 40:41.020
Your Highness!

40:43.620 --> 40:44.250
Your Highness!

41:58.140 --> 42:00.540
The rioters have robbed the barn.

42:01.170 --> 42:03.690
I fear that Li Ni:
attack the city soon.

42:13.330 --> 42:14.060
Jing,

42:14.650 --> 42:16.330
I don't want you to go to war anymore.

42:22.370 --> 42:23.500
Let's go.

42:33.250 --> 42:35.140
I thought

42:36.210 --> 42:37.900
time flew

42:39.690 --> 42:41.620
since we met.

42:43.170 --> 42:47.060
We have already lived half our lives
in the blink of an eye.

42:48.420 --> 42:49.250
Why not

42:51.540 --> 42:52.620
put on a suit of armor

42:54.650 --> 42:56.140
and join you in the defense of the city?

43:02.920 --> 43:04.010
Don't say such ridiculous things.

43:04.690 --> 43:05.900
Stay here.

43:06.690 --> 43:08.420
I will drink with you again

43:09.420 --> 43:11.060
once I close Li Ni.

43:27.650 --> 43:29.100
I will wait for your return.

43:33.770 --> 43:34.940
Wait for my return.

44:38.540 --> 44:40.020
Attack!

44:41.140 --> 44:56.580
Charge!

46:06.020 --> 46:07.690
Here and here.

46:07.690 --> 46:09.110
Increases defense around those areas.

46:09.290 --> 46:10.060
Reporting!

46:10.250 --> 46:10.840
Great governor,

46:10.850 --> 46:12.620
the Zhenxi army and the Cui army
are too ruthless.

46:12.620 --> 46:13.810
They have put in stepped stairs.

46:13.810 --> 46:15.310
Several of our doors are
under assault.

46:15.460 --> 46:16.580
Our forces are exhausted.

46:16.770 --> 46:18.060
We are suffering many casualties!

46:18.120 --> 46:20.500
Order the Imperial Army rear
detachment to scale the city wall.

46:20.500 --> 46:21.540
(Sun)
Guard the doors.

46:21.730 --> 46:22.980
No one is allowed to withdraw!

46:23.500 --> 46:25.540
Those who go against my order
will be executed!

46:25.810 --> 46:26.580
Yes, Great Governor!

47:22.770 --> 47:23.420
Great governor,

47:23.430 --> 47:25.360
The rioters have started
fighting our soldiers.

47:25.360 --> 47:27.050
Some are even stealing
the kerosene that defends the doors!

47:27.060 --> 47:28.720
Mr. Governor, please give us
your instruction!

47:33.020 --> 47:33.980
Don't leave any of

47:34.250 --> 47:35.140
the rioters alive.

47:35.420 --> 47:36.540
Kill everyone.

47:36.730 --> 47:37.510
Yes, Great Governor.

47:44.620 --> 47:46.170
Mr. Governor, the city is in chaos.

47:46.220 --> 47:47.100
We are in a difficult situation.

47:47.120 --> 47:48.640
Great governor, why don't you
get out of town

47:48.650 --> 47:50.290
and regroup our forces at Tong Pass?

47:50.300 --> 47:52.110
We just have to endure
their attack for a few more days.

47:52.290 --> 47:54.500
By then, the army I have sent to Baiyue
will return.

47:55.510 --> 47:57.610
Naturally, we will be able to surround
the Zhenxi Army and the Cui Army

47:57.620 --> 47:58.650
and they annihilate them.

48:02.060 --> 48:02.690
Great governor,

48:02.850 --> 48:04.110
When there is life, there is hope!

48:04.210 --> 48:04.770
¡Deja!

48:05.770 --> 48:07.060
Order all soldiers to

48:14.210 --> 48:14.940
Great Governor!

48:15.020 --> 48:15.730
Great Governor!

48:15.940 --> 48:16.540
Great Governor!

48:16.810 --> 48:17.940
Great Governor!

48:18.100 --> 48:18.850
Great Governor!

48:18.980 --> 48:20.330
Great Governor!

48:30.730 --> 48:34.420
- Great Governor!
- Great Governor!

48:34.980 --> 48:38.850
- Great Governor!
- Great Governor!

49:01.550 --> 49:03.540
(Zhenxi)

49:58.100 --> 49:58.690
Your Majesty!

49:58.720 --> 50:00.210
The Zhenxi Army has entered the city!

50:00.210 --> 50:00.810
Your Majesty!

50:00.900 --> 50:02.330
The Zhenxi Army has entered the city!

50:04.620 --> 50:05.460
(Mrs. Jin,)

50:06.100 --> 50:09.850
(Since I have agreed to launch
a double attack with Li Ni,)

50:10.100 --> 50:12.210
(we have to deliver the fatal blow)

50:12.420 --> 50:14.500
(to Sun Jing also inside the palace.)

50:15.020 --> 50:16.420
