01:55.530 --> 01:57.850

03:30.371 --> 03:32.131
But I understand your feelings.

You don't want

Mister Shiqi,

06:22.338 --> 06:24.817
I knew you would come this way
when you left the pass.

06:24.857 --> 06:26.538
So, I brought our men

06:26.617 --> 06:28.096
to meet you here.

06:28.097 --> 06:28.977
So, what do you think?

06:29.057 --> 06:30.297
We're pretty loyal, right?

06:30.938 --> 06:32.976
Unlike someone

06:32.977 --> 06:35.577
who knocked out his brother.

06:35.578 --> 06:36.536
Go back first.

06:36.537 --> 06:37.817
There's an ambush nearby.

06:39.497 --> 06:40.578
All right.

06:53.297 --> 06:54.057
Withdraw.

06:58.737 --> 06:59.617
Taozi.

07:00.602 --> 07:01.482
Taozi,

07:01.602 --> 07:02.281
I brought

07:02.282 --> 07:03.521
your favorite dried nuts.

07:03.522 --> 07:04.201
Here you go.

07:11.602 --> 07:12.641
What's wrong?

07:12.641 --> 07:14.362
Don't you want
to eat dried nuts anymore?

07:17.441 --> 07:19.722
It's not that I don't want
to eat dried nuts.

07:20.282 --> 07:22.042
It's just that tomorrow

07:22.921 --> 07:24.680
I have to leave with Lieutenant He

07:24.681 --> 07:26.321
after the troops withdraw.

07:27.842 --> 07:29.641
Why so soon?

07:32.642 --> 07:34.360
The Great General learned

07:34.361 --> 07:36.201
that the Lieutenant He
suddenly fell seriously ill.

07:36.202 --> 07:37.440
He was extremely worried

07:37.440 --> 07:39.720
and insisted on coming
to personally escort the Lieutenant He.

07:39.722 --> 07:40.880
But he's the Great General

07:40.881 --> 07:42.121
in charge of two towns.

07:42.402 --> 07:44.601
If he appears abruptly at Tong Pass,

07:44.602 --> 07:46.641
it might lead
to misunderstandings in the court.

07:46.642 --> 07:48.920
So, the Lieutenant He said
we have to withdraw quickly.

07:48.921 --> 07:51.321
So, we can meet the Great General
on the way.

07:51.962 --> 07:53.761
Then, I'll go send you off tomorrow.

07:54.241 --> 07:55.602
Don't bother.

07:55.762 --> 07:57.441
Lieutenant He is not in a good mood.

07:57.522 --> 07:58.320
I don't want her

07:58.321 --> 07:59.801
to see anyone from the Zhenxi Army.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.961
I'll go and talk to Mister Shiqi

08:02.962 --> 08:04.441
to apologize to the Lieutenant He.

08:05.402 --> 08:06.801
Come back here.

08:07.722 --> 08:09.201
Don't interfere

08:09.202 --> 08:10.561
if you don't know anything.

08:10.762 --> 08:11.801
But...

08:14.722 --> 08:16.922
But I don't want to part ways with you.

08:25.042 --> 08:27.641
What you see in dreams may not be
as real as what you see in paintings.

08:27.762 --> 08:30.401
So, parting ways may not be
as sad as you think it is.

08:32.762 --> 08:34.802
What does that mean?

08:36.122 --> 08:38.082
Lieutenant He said it.

08:38.561 --> 08:40.202
It means

08:40.402 --> 08:42.401
if people stay apart long enough,

08:42.522 --> 08:44.761
they won't feel sad anymore.

08:45.402 --> 08:47.082
I see it differently.

08:48.362 --> 08:49.800
As long we stay apart,

08:49.801 --> 08:51.121
I would feel sad.

08:51.321 --> 08:53.082
If we stay apart long enough,

08:55.002 --> 08:56.722
I would be very sad.

09:53.921 --> 09:55.641
Why are you doing this?

09:55.681 --> 09:57.602
Not even giving her a farewell.

09:58.002 --> 09:59.600
Instead, you're standing here,

09:59.601 --> 10:01.401
staring at the empty space.

10:04.081 --> 10:06.001
Who says I'm staring at the empty space?

10:06.321 --> 10:07.962
I'm looking at the terrain
on both sides.

10:09.402 --> 10:12.080
Whether you look or not
doesn't matter now.

10:12.081 --> 10:13.281
What matters

10:13.282 --> 10:16.121
is when you start feeling empty inside
while waiting here.

10:16.122 --> 10:18.562
Only then you'll know
what it feels like.

10:19.362 --> 10:20.082
Here.

10:21.002 --> 10:22.481
Did the people we sent out last night

10:22.482 --> 10:23.761
find anything?

10:24.961 --> 10:27.641
There are some traces in this forest.

10:27.642 --> 10:28.960
But it's hard to tell.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.281
Those people are very cautious

10:30.282 --> 10:31.881
in their actions.

10:32.801 --> 10:33.761
Oh!

10:33.882 --> 10:34.680
Could it be

10:34.681 --> 10:36.361
that they are targeting Miss Cui?

10:36.362 --> 10:38.080
I heard Miss Cui

10:38.081 --> 10:39.481
is still not well.

10:39.482 --> 10:40.320
When she left,

10:40.321 --> 10:41.680
she traveled in a carriage.

10:41.681 --> 10:43.202
Aren't you going to escort her?

10:45.081 --> 10:46.440
They're not going after her.

10:46.441 --> 10:48.202
They're likely after me.

10:48.762 --> 10:49.722
Besides,

10:51.002 --> 10:52.600
she has the army guarding her,

10:52.601 --> 10:53.241
and her father

10:53.242 --> 10:55.001
also sent elite soldiers
to meet up with her.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.562
She'll be fine.

10:57.561 --> 10:58.680
You sure

10:58.681 --> 11:00.361
are stubborn.

11:00.362 --> 11:01.481
If you don't go after her,

11:01.482 --> 11:03.401
you'll regret it in the future.

11:05.522 --> 11:06.840
We should focus

11:06.841 --> 11:08.241
on important matters.

11:08.362 --> 11:09.682
We've secured Tong Pass,

11:09.841 --> 11:11.521
and the army should return
to the capital.

11:17.321 --> 11:18.482
What are you looking at?

11:19.201 --> 11:20.401
I'm watching

11:20.402 --> 11:22.241
two lonely geese in the sky.

11:22.241 --> 11:25.082
One is heading south,
and the other is heading north.

11:25.201 --> 11:27.641
It's quite pitiful.

11:28.482 --> 11:30.041
I wonder

11:30.042 --> 11:32.362
if they can fly together.

11:54.642 --> 11:57.001
Lord Qin requested
to return to the capital

11:57.002 --> 11:58.482
and will be back today.

11:58.761 --> 12:00.600
At first, the Ministry of Rites
was considering

12:00.601 --> 12:02.680
whether to have the officials
welcome him.

12:02.681 --> 12:05.161
But Lord Qin declined.

12:05.282 --> 12:06.281
However, today,

12:06.282 --> 12:07.960
all the young ladies in the city

12:07.961 --> 12:09.680
rushed to the streets

12:09.681 --> 12:11.241
to see Lord Qin leading the army

12:11.242 --> 12:12.921
returning with victory.

12:13.042 --> 12:14.080
It's widely spread

12:14.081 --> 12:16.440
that Lord Qin is truly valiant

12:16.441 --> 12:18.161
and awe-inspiring.

12:18.402 --> 12:21.041
Father, say whatever you want to say.

12:22.002 --> 12:23.161
When do you plan

12:23.162 --> 12:25.842
to visit Lord Qin?

12:25.882 --> 12:27.401
Three days later.

12:28.162 --> 12:30.121
Why three days later?

12:30.882 --> 12:32.962
I'm waiting for someone.

12:33.242 --> 12:34.842
When that person arrives,

12:35.042 --> 12:35.881
only then I can go

12:35.882 --> 12:37.562
and meet Lord Qin.

12:50.921 --> 12:51.761
Hey, Bao.

12:52.122 --> 12:53.082
Shiqi,

12:53.242 --> 12:54.600
since we have nothing to do today,

12:54.600 --> 12:56.120
let's go out of the city
for a horse ride.

12:56.402 --> 12:57.241
No.

12:58.561 --> 13:01.562
I heard Fengying Pavilion has received
a batch of good alcohol.

13:01.642 --> 13:02.881
Let's go for a drink.

13:03.841 --> 13:05.041
No.

13:06.042 --> 13:08.121
What's going on with you?

13:09.721 --> 13:11.521
Ever since we returned to the capital,

13:11.522 --> 13:13.161
you've changed like a different person.

13:13.282 --> 13:14.680
You're moody all day

13:14.681 --> 13:16.322
and even pulling a long face.

13:16.721 --> 13:17.482
What happened?

13:17.882 --> 13:19.322
Who made you angry?

13:19.801 --> 13:21.001
Or

13:21.002 --> 13:22.481
did someone offend you

13:22.482 --> 13:23.761
and you're upset about it?

13:23.762 --> 13:25.241
In this world,

13:25.242 --> 13:26.920
one thing can conquer another.

13:26.921 --> 13:29.281
Do you think no one can deal

13:29.282 --> 13:31.442
with the mighty and invincible Lord Qin?

13:31.721 --> 13:32.840
Stop talking in riddles

13:32.841 --> 13:33.600
and just tell me.

13:33.601 --> 13:35.362
Don't listen to his nonsense.

13:35.882 --> 13:37.320
Me? Talking nonsense?

13:37.321 --> 13:39.560
It's better than someone being bothered

13:39.561 --> 13:41.041
with wild thoughts.

13:42.122 --> 13:44.682
Mister Shiqi,
Miss Gu is seeking an audience.

13:49.681 --> 13:51.001
Greetings, Lord Qin.

13:54.242 --> 13:55.281
Your Highness.

13:55.441 --> 13:56.842
Miss Gu, you're too kind.

14:03.402 --> 14:04.442
Nanny?

14:05.482 --> 14:06.722
Nanny, please sit.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.482
Shiqi,

14:13.522 --> 14:15.442
you're all grown-up now.

14:18.921 --> 14:20.521
Our little young master

14:21.122 --> 14:23.881
is now Lord Qin.

14:25.242 --> 14:27.161
Since I arrived in the capital,

14:27.242 --> 14:30.001
I've heard everyone praising

14:30.042 --> 14:32.560
Lord Qin for his might.

14:32.561 --> 14:33.840
Every young lady wants

14:33.841 --> 14:36.041
to marry Lord Qin.

14:36.561 --> 14:39.082
Nanny, why are you here?

14:40.841 --> 14:44.001
I've been living in the countryside
for many years.

14:44.282 --> 14:46.322
I'm not feeling well

14:46.441 --> 14:48.962
and no one could send me to the capital.

14:49.122 --> 14:50.320
This time,

14:50.321 --> 14:52.521
it's all thanks to Miss Gu

14:52.522 --> 14:55.041
who somehow managed
to send someone to find me,

14:55.042 --> 14:57.641
asking if I wanted to see you.

14:58.721 --> 15:01.241
Of course, I'm happy to do so.

15:06.882 --> 15:09.962
Now that I've seen you,

15:11.002 --> 15:13.682
I can die happily

15:14.721 --> 15:16.840
even if I die now.

15:16.841 --> 15:17.881
Nanny,

15:17.882 --> 15:19.521
don't say such things.

15:20.282 --> 15:21.802
I'm happy.

15:22.321 --> 15:24.001
I'm truly happy.

15:24.321 --> 15:25.121
Nanny,

15:25.642 --> 15:26.641
since you're here,

15:26.681 --> 15:27.802
stay with us.

15:27.841 --> 15:29.362
My residence is quite spacious.

15:29.402 --> 15:31.161
You can stay wherever you like.

15:31.162 --> 15:32.322
All right.

15:32.801 --> 15:33.921
All right.

15:39.801 --> 15:42.602
You've grown up. You're all grown up.

15:43.242 --> 15:44.241
Your Highness,

15:44.482 --> 15:46.161
she's used to taking an afternoon nap.

15:46.162 --> 15:46.881
I've just

15:46.882 --> 15:48.281
assisted her to sleep.

15:48.321 --> 15:49.722
You can rest assured, Your Highness.

15:50.921 --> 15:52.241
Thank you, Miss Gu.

15:52.561 --> 15:55.161
It's a small matter,
not worth mentioning.

15:56.561 --> 15:58.121
Nanny is getting old.

15:59.042 --> 16:01.121
I once sent people to find her.

16:01.681 --> 16:03.401
But it was in vain.

16:04.681 --> 16:06.082
I even thought

16:06.362 --> 16:08.322
I would never see her again.

16:10.482 --> 16:11.800
The nanny's own son

16:11.801 --> 16:13.401
is very unfilial.

16:13.401 --> 16:15.240
I didn't give him money.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.682
Instead, I asked village head
to question him thoroughly.

16:18.201 --> 16:20.080
Nanny's family is poor.

16:20.081 --> 16:22.161
So, I bought a few acres of good land

16:22.162 --> 16:23.682
in your name.

16:23.721 --> 16:24.361
The deed

16:24.362 --> 16:26.200
is all in the nanny's name.

16:26.201 --> 16:27.041
In the future,

16:27.042 --> 16:29.521
if she doesn't want to stay
in your residence

16:29.522 --> 16:31.040
and wants to retire to the countryside,

16:31.040 --> 16:32.241
it should be enough.

16:34.201 --> 16:35.202
Miss Gu,

16:35.601 --> 16:37.800
you're a kind and thoughtful person.

16:37.801 --> 16:38.962
Thank you.

16:41.441 --> 16:44.121
Also, the money used to buy the land

16:44.122 --> 16:44.840
will be sent

16:44.841 --> 16:46.401
to your residence later.

16:46.841 --> 16:48.482
Your Highness, you're too kind.

16:49.601 --> 16:51.001
I'm not smart since I was a child.

16:51.002 --> 16:52.361
To be honest,

16:52.362 --> 16:55.001
I'm not favored by my parents.

16:55.441 --> 16:57.761
So, whenever someone
is a little kind to me,

16:57.762 --> 16:59.401
I'm very grateful.

16:59.882 --> 17:02.161
Your Highness, you saved my life.

17:02.242 --> 17:03.481
I can never repay

17:03.482 --> 17:05.161
such great kindness.

17:05.361 --> 17:06.840
So, I can only do some

17:06.841 --> 17:08.521
little things within my ability.

17:08.522 --> 17:10.481
I only hope you will always be happy.

17:10.482 --> 17:12.961
That's enough for me to be very happy.

17:14.161 --> 17:15.201
Thank you.

17:17.801 --> 17:19.880
The officials advised me

17:19.881 --> 17:23.282
to reward Cui Yi

17:23.482 --> 17:25.800
and to ingratiate myself

17:25.801 --> 17:27.282
with the Cui family.

17:28.841 --> 17:30.320
He already controls two prefectures,

17:30.321 --> 17:31.400
Pingliang and Weiyang.

17:31.401 --> 17:33.762
How can I reward them?

17:34.081 --> 17:34.840
Besides,

17:34.841 --> 17:36.921
he doesn't have a son
whom I can confer a title to.

17:37.282 --> 17:44.282
What can I do
to properly win the Cui family over?

17:46.841 --> 17:47.521
Father,

17:47.522 --> 17:49.481
I have an idea.

17:50.321 --> 17:51.042
Tell me quickly.

17:52.002 --> 17:53.001
I heard

17:53.002 --> 17:54.521
Cui Yi has a daughter,

17:54.522 --> 17:56.881
and she grew up in the military,

17:56.962 --> 17:58.522
not inferior to a son.

17:58.841 --> 18:00.880
Since I have not yet married,

18:00.881 --> 18:02.600
how about Father bestows Miss Cui

18:02.601 --> 18:03.681
in marriage to me?

18:03.682 --> 18:04.320
This way,

18:04.321 --> 18:05.241
Miss Cui

18:05.242 --> 18:07.120
becomes your daughter-in-law,

18:07.121 --> 18:08.080
and Cui Yi

18:08.081 --> 18:10.041
becomes my father-in-law.

18:10.042 --> 18:11.080
Even if, in the future,

18:11.081 --> 18:13.481
I ask him to withdraw from Dongdu,
it may be possible too.

18:14.081 --> 18:14.721
Good.

18:15.401 --> 18:17.681
This plan is good, very good.

18:25.482 --> 18:28.002
I just don't know

18:29.962 --> 18:31.640
what Miss Cui looks like.

18:31.641 --> 18:34.322
If she grew up in the military,

18:34.922 --> 18:36.802
is she rough?

18:36.922 --> 18:39.041
If her appearance is ugly

18:39.042 --> 18:40.881
and her temperament is coarse,

18:42.962 --> 18:44.041
wouldn't it

18:44.042 --> 18:45.641
be really unfair to you?

18:46.042 --> 18:47.880
I am your son.

18:47.881 --> 18:49.721
So, I should share your worries.

18:50.121 --> 18:51.760
Winning the Cui family
is to avoid suspicion

18:51.760 --> 18:52.961
between the ruler and the subject.

18:52.962 --> 18:55.120
This is my duty.

18:55.121 --> 18:56.201
Father, rest assured.

18:56.202 --> 18:59.681
Regardless of what Miss Cui's appearance
and character are like,

18:59.682 --> 19:01.120
I am willing to marry her

19:01.121 --> 19:02.600
and treat her well,

19:02.601 --> 19:04.681
ensuring the Cui family

19:04.682 --> 19:06.002
remains loyal to you.

19:10.722 --> 19:12.201
Lai,

19:13.161 --> 19:16.121
you are the one
who considers the overall situation.

19:16.321 --> 19:17.842
But don't worry.

19:17.962 --> 19:19.041
In the future,

19:19.042 --> 19:20.881
I'll definitely give you
several beautiful women

19:20.962 --> 19:22.322
to serve you as side consorts.

19:22.361 --> 19:24.120
I won't let you suffer

19:24.121 --> 19:26.082
such unfairness for nothing.

19:26.202 --> 19:27.481
Don't worry.

19:29.841 --> 19:31.121
Father, have some tea.

19:31.321 --> 19:32.042
All right.

19:35.561 --> 19:36.800
Are you saying

19:36.801 --> 19:38.481
someone from the court sent
a message saying

19:38.601 --> 19:40.641
they want me to marry Lord Qi?

19:41.522 --> 19:43.400
He's aiming at someone
outside of his league.

19:43.401 --> 19:44.921
Who does Lord Qi think he is?

19:44.922 --> 19:46.840
I can't believe he asks
for your hand in marriage.

19:47.121 --> 19:49.521
The Emperor is indeed Li Ni's father.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.600
Like father, like son,

19:51.601 --> 19:53.242
who don't know their place.

19:57.841 --> 20:00.282
All right, I'll stop.

20:00.762 --> 20:03.362
I'll stop talking about the person
who was not to know good from bad.

20:03.522 --> 20:04.602
Father,

20:05.081 --> 20:06.562
I'm thinking,

20:06.881 --> 20:09.362
since someone from the court
has such intentions,

20:09.641 --> 20:11.560
why don't we play along

20:11.561 --> 20:13.282
and turn the tables on them?

20:14.002 --> 20:15.121
Ying,

20:15.641 --> 20:17.201
do you mean...

20:17.881 --> 20:19.120
We will openly write a memorial

20:19.121 --> 20:20.400
to the Emperor.

20:20.401 --> 20:21.560
In the memorial,

20:21.561 --> 20:24.001
I agree to marry a prince.

20:24.002 --> 20:25.721
But I want to choose

20:25.722 --> 20:27.360
my husband

20:27.361 --> 20:28.641
among the princes.

20:28.841 --> 20:31.121
That Li Ni doesn't know his place.

20:31.722 --> 20:33.400
Do you still want to marry him?

20:33.401 --> 20:35.362
Whether or not I marry him
is another matter.

20:35.522 --> 20:37.001
But since someone in the court

20:37.002 --> 20:38.560
already has designs on our Cui family,

20:38.561 --> 20:40.721
why not be straightforward

20:40.722 --> 20:42.322
and use their own tricks against them?

20:43.442 --> 20:44.921
Are you saying...

20:45.641 --> 20:46.880
As long as I say

20:46.881 --> 20:49.161
I want to choose a husband
from among the princes,

20:49.282 --> 20:51.961
there will be a big commotion.

20:52.361 --> 20:53.961
I don't know what actions

20:53.962 --> 20:55.041
Li Ni's two older brothers

20:55.042 --> 20:56.282
might take.

20:56.801 --> 20:58.201
I'm curious to see

20:58.202 --> 20:58.961
how shameless

20:58.962 --> 21:00.161
they can be.

21:01.002 --> 21:02.322
I'm also curious

21:02.482 --> 21:04.161
about Li Ni's reaction.

21:04.242 --> 21:05.201
Ying,

21:05.202 --> 21:07.242
this is your lifelong matter.

21:07.361 --> 21:08.961
Don't act in anger.

21:09.161 --> 21:11.842
Father, I'm not doing this out of anger.

21:12.321 --> 21:13.281
Now,

21:13.282 --> 21:15.640
you have control over Pingliang and Weiyang,

21:15.641 --> 21:18.161
and our Cui Army is strong.

21:18.202 --> 21:20.120
Many in the court are uneasy,

21:20.121 --> 21:21.640
seeing us as a piece of meat

21:21.641 --> 21:23.562
everyone wants to grab.

21:24.081 --> 21:25.322
In that case,

21:25.442 --> 21:27.481
why not make the first move

21:27.482 --> 21:28.241
and weaken them

21:28.242 --> 21:30.002
with internal conflicts first?

21:32.121 --> 21:34.042
You must think carefully.

21:35.161 --> 21:37.362
Once I submit this memorial,

21:38.321 --> 21:39.761
you can only choose your future husband

21:39.762 --> 21:42.242
from among the three princes.

21:42.841 --> 21:44.602
There's no turning back after that.

21:44.801 --> 21:46.681
The final outcome

21:47.002 --> 21:49.362
may not go as we wish.

21:52.081 --> 21:53.161
Father,

21:53.522 --> 21:55.322
I've considered

21:55.401 --> 21:57.201
the interests and risks involved.

21:57.561 --> 21:59.481
Life is like a chess game.

21:59.841 --> 22:01.160
This world

22:01.161 --> 22:02.921
is the biggest game.

22:03.042 --> 22:05.481
I want to be the one playing the chess.

22:06.841 --> 22:09.282
Lord Qin has too many concerns
in his heart

22:09.561 --> 22:11.282
and has no interest
in being the crown prince.

22:12.641 --> 22:14.881
I had a long talk with him.

22:14.962 --> 22:16.562
But it had little effect.

22:16.641 --> 22:18.800
Since he's willing to be a chess piece,

22:18.801 --> 22:20.281
even if I have to force him,

22:20.282 --> 22:21.120
I will make him

22:21.121 --> 22:22.641
the other player.

22:24.361 --> 22:25.201
Father,

22:26.841 --> 22:28.362
I want to take this risk.

22:30.321 --> 22:31.522
Your Majesty,

22:31.881 --> 22:34.201
in Cui Yi's memorial,

22:34.282 --> 22:35.880
it claims Your Majesty intends

22:35.880 --> 22:38.521
to bestow his daughter's marriage
to Lord Qi.

22:38.522 --> 22:40.121
Is this true?

22:42.682 --> 22:45.600
I did send someone to inquire.

22:45.601 --> 22:48.002
Your Majesty's intention
is the imperial decree.

22:48.042 --> 22:49.840
However, as a subject,

22:49.841 --> 22:51.562
he dared to speak arrogantly,

22:52.081 --> 22:54.842
wanting to choose a son-in-law
among the princes for his daughter

22:54.881 --> 22:57.362
as if court customs meant nothing.

22:57.442 --> 22:59.640
I ask Your Majesty to issue a decree

22:59.641 --> 23:01.281
to rectify the court's morals.

23:01.282 --> 23:02.441
That's right!

23:03.522 --> 23:05.001
Cui Yi

23:05.002 --> 23:07.320
is indeed too arrogant.

23:07.321 --> 23:09.681
Does he see the imperial family
as a marketplace

23:09.682 --> 23:11.322
where he can pick and choose?

23:13.881 --> 23:14.800
Your Majesty,

23:14.801 --> 23:15.961
Cui Yi controls two prefectures,

23:15.962 --> 23:17.961
Pingliang and Weiyang,

23:17.962 --> 23:19.521
and now occupies Dongdu.

23:19.522 --> 23:20.640
The court is already worried

23:20.641 --> 23:22.761
about his excessive power

23:22.762 --> 23:24.600
without any checks.

23:24.601 --> 23:26.241
It is wise for Your Majesty

23:26.241 --> 23:29.362
to choose Miss Cui
as daughter-in-law.

23:29.682 --> 23:30.320
Now,

23:30.321 --> 23:32.961
it's only a gentle appeal
from Cui Yi requesting

23:32.961 --> 23:35.802
to choose an imperial prince
for his daughter.

23:36.601 --> 23:38.600
Your Majesty, why not agree?

23:38.601 --> 23:41.281
This action costs
no soldiers or resources

23:41.282 --> 23:44.042
and can bring the military power
of the Cui family under control.

23:44.161 --> 23:46.481
It's truly clever.

23:49.762 --> 23:53.242
I also think this idea is not bad.

23:53.962 --> 23:55.281
However, for my son

23:55.282 --> 23:56.921
to marry his daughter

23:56.922 --> 23:58.320
is the ultimate honor

23:58.321 --> 24:00.082
for the Cui family.

24:00.161 --> 24:02.041
How can they send a memorial

24:02.042 --> 24:04.121
suggesting to choose one themselves?

24:04.202 --> 24:05.880
Your Majesty's words are correct.

24:05.881 --> 24:07.120
The Cui family is impudent!

24:07.120 --> 24:09.640
How can Miss Cui be worthy
of becoming a princess consort?

24:09.640 --> 24:11.280
Military officers
who lack moral character!

24:11.280 --> 24:12.280
However, as a ruler,

24:12.280 --> 24:14.440
His Majesty has a broad mind
and can tolerate the world.

24:14.440 --> 24:17.681
What the Cui family has done,
His Majesty can surely forgive.

24:18.042 --> 24:21.120
Putting the ruler before the subjects
is just and proper!

24:21.121 --> 24:22.360
There is no reason for a subject

24:22.361 --> 24:24.160
to choose an imperial son-in-law.

24:24.161 --> 24:25.800
You are stuck in outdated ways,

24:25.801 --> 24:27.080
resistant to change!

24:27.080 --> 24:28.441
You're old-fashioned and rigid!

24:28.442 --> 24:29.241
By speaking like this,

24:29.242 --> 24:30.840
you're not showing respect
to His Majesty

24:30.840 --> 24:32.560
or honoring the traditions
of our ancestors!

24:32.560 --> 24:34.070
You truly lack
an understanding of etiquette!

24:34.070 --> 24:35.600
You're lacking
an understanding of etiquette!

24:35.600 --> 24:36.920
You forgot
the teaching of the ancestors!

24:36.920 --> 24:39.687
(Lord Xin's Residence)

24:40.922 --> 24:42.042
Thank you, sister-in-law.

24:42.121 --> 24:43.160
You're too kind, Lai.

24:43.161 --> 24:45.082
I'll leave you two to talk.

24:51.841 --> 24:54.241
Jun, you sure have married
the right woman.

24:54.242 --> 24:56.002
I'm truly envious.

24:56.401 --> 24:59.121
You rushed to my residence
right after the morning court ended.

24:59.282 --> 25:00.842
What do you want?

25:01.922 --> 25:02.761
Jun,

25:02.762 --> 25:04.802
you must help me this time.

25:04.881 --> 25:07.281
Cui Yi said he wants to choose
a son-in-law between me and Li Ni.

25:07.282 --> 25:07.961
Cui Yi said,

25:07.962 --> 25:10.481
selecting among the princes.

25:13.002 --> 25:13.921
I was thinking

25:13.922 --> 25:15.481
that you already
have a princess consort.

25:15.482 --> 25:16.961
I supposed Miss Cui wouldn't want

25:16.962 --> 25:18.521
to be a side consort.

25:18.522 --> 25:19.880
So, I thought

25:19.881 --> 25:21.802
if you could help me

25:22.121 --> 25:24.360
get the support of the Cui family,

25:24.361 --> 25:28.042
I could definitely assist you
in moving into the Eastern Palace.

25:31.242 --> 25:32.802
What do you think, Jun?

25:36.641 --> 25:38.641
You have a point.

25:38.682 --> 25:40.681
We must not

25:41.202 --> 25:44.721
let Miss Cui marry Li Ni.

25:45.282 --> 25:47.161
Thank you, Jun.

25:52.841 --> 25:55.320
I'm impressed with Miss Cui

25:55.320 --> 25:57.921
with all my heart
and sincerely convinced.

25:58.682 --> 25:59.800
You see,

25:59.801 --> 26:02.560
His Majesty wants to marry Miss Cui
to Lord Qi.

26:02.561 --> 26:03.960
See how clever she was?

26:03.960 --> 26:05.400
She voluntarily submitted a memorial,

26:05.400 --> 26:06.281
stating that she wanted

26:06.282 --> 26:08.320
to choose a husband from the princes.

26:08.321 --> 26:09.800
Isn't it obvious

26:09.801 --> 26:11.840
that she wants to marry Mister Shiqi?

26:11.841 --> 26:13.441
- Exactly!
- That's right!

26:13.922 --> 26:14.961
Mister Shiqi,

26:15.081 --> 26:17.282
you have to show her some gestures.

26:17.762 --> 26:19.080
Yes, show some gestures.

26:19.081 --> 26:20.400
- Yes, you need to.
- Do it.

26:20.401 --> 26:21.041
She only said

26:21.042 --> 26:22.640
to pick among the princes.

26:22.641 --> 26:23.961
She didn't say it was me.

26:24.482 --> 26:26.041
Stop being stubborn.

26:26.042 --> 26:27.521
As a young lady,

26:27.522 --> 26:29.041
do you expect her to name you directly

26:29.042 --> 26:30.041
to marry you?

26:30.042 --> 26:31.001
Who else would she marry

26:31.002 --> 26:31.840
if not you?

26:31.841 --> 26:32.600
That's right.

26:32.601 --> 26:33.840
If she doesn't want to marry you,

26:33.841 --> 26:34.600
why would she submit

26:34.601 --> 26:36.041
such a memorial to His Majesty?

26:36.042 --> 26:37.360
- That's right!
- Precisely.

26:37.361 --> 26:38.160
- Shiqi.
- Exactly.

26:38.160 --> 26:40.481
Marrying Miss Cui would be having
the best of both worlds,

26:40.482 --> 26:41.082
am I right?

26:41.442 --> 26:42.721
Miss Cui

26:42.722 --> 26:45.762
may be formidable at times.

26:45.962 --> 26:49.320
But she's Cui Yi's only daughter.

26:49.321 --> 26:50.961
In the future, her husband

26:50.962 --> 26:53.160
will oversee the entire Cui Army.

26:53.161 --> 26:54.120
So, can we

26:54.121 --> 26:55.401
let Lord Qi gain

26:55.482 --> 26:57.560
this favorable situation?

26:57.561 --> 26:58.721
Of course not!

26:58.722 --> 26:59.280
Right.

26:59.280 --> 27:00.480
- No way!
- We can't let him have it.

27:00.480 --> 27:01.961
But that's not the crucial part.

27:02.081 --> 27:03.681
What matters most?

27:03.722 --> 27:05.721
It's that Miss Cui

27:05.801 --> 27:10.121
already has good feelings toward Shiqi.

27:10.881 --> 27:11.600
General Pei Yuan

27:11.601 --> 27:12.802
is absolutely right.

27:13.682 --> 27:14.602
Ear,

27:14.641 --> 27:16.961
you must be happy this time, right?

27:17.282 --> 27:19.320
If Miss Cui marries Mister Shiqi,

27:19.321 --> 27:20.880
Taozi will naturally come

27:20.881 --> 27:22.521
to Lord Qin's Residence.

27:22.522 --> 27:24.880
Then, you two

27:24.881 --> 27:27.042
can live together happily.

27:27.922 --> 27:29.641
Yes, live a blissful life together.

27:33.002 --> 27:33.681
Mister Shiqi.

27:33.682 --> 27:34.201
Yes.

27:34.202 --> 27:35.640
Miss Cui's dowry

27:35.641 --> 27:37.241
must be at least
three hundred carts, right?

27:37.242 --> 27:38.520
It has to be, it has to be.

27:38.520 --> 27:40.441
Then our betrothal gifts
can't be lacking either.

27:40.442 --> 27:41.562
Indeed.

27:44.282 --> 27:45.880
It's our village tradition

27:45.881 --> 27:48.000
to have a pair of wild geese
as part of the betrothal gifts.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.522
The groom must personally shoot them.

27:49.762 --> 27:51.001
Since we have nice weather now,

27:51.002 --> 27:53.441
how about we accompany you
outside the city to hunt wild geese?

27:53.881 --> 27:54.400
That's right.

27:54.401 --> 27:56.080
If Mister Shiqi fails to get any,

27:56.081 --> 27:57.441
and we manage to shoot the geese,

27:57.442 --> 27:58.360
does it count?

27:58.360 --> 27:59.480
Of course, it doesn't count.

27:59.480 --> 28:02.080
Didn't he say earlier
the groom must personally shoot them?

28:02.081 --> 28:03.160
Of course, it counts.

28:03.161 --> 28:04.880
We are Mister Shiqi's brothers,

28:04.881 --> 28:06.001
his family.

28:06.002 --> 28:06.400
Yes.

28:06.401 --> 28:07.760
If family shoots, why wouldn't it count?

28:07.760 --> 28:09.320
- No, it doesn't count.
- Yes, it counts.

28:09.320 --> 28:11.241
- No, it can't!
- I said it does count.

28:11.242 --> 28:13.080
- It just doesn't count.
- All right. Enough already.

28:13.081 --> 28:14.281
Stop fighting!

28:14.282 --> 28:15.082
Shiqi.

28:15.401 --> 28:16.401
Shiqi.

28:16.641 --> 28:17.600
I say it counts.

28:17.601 --> 28:18.160
Mister Shiqi.

28:18.161 --> 28:19.881
Mister Shiqi, where are you going?

28:20.282 --> 28:21.720
When are we going to hunt wild geese?

28:21.720 --> 28:23.201
We'll prepare the bows and arrows.

28:34.042 --> 28:34.921
Young Master.

28:39.482 --> 28:40.322
Young Master.

28:40.561 --> 28:41.602
What do you think

28:41.962 --> 28:44.082
Ying meant

28:44.361 --> 28:45.842
when she submitted this memorial?

28:49.442 --> 28:50.762
It's probably

28:52.042 --> 28:53.961
because she doesn't want
to marry Lord Qi.

28:54.601 --> 28:55.840
So, she politely declined.

28:55.841 --> 28:57.762
It was because she only wanted
to marry Li Ni!

29:03.561 --> 29:05.961
Why is Ying doing this to me?

29:07.682 --> 29:09.562
I have been devoted to her.

29:11.482 --> 29:13.802
Can't she see that at all?

29:14.282 --> 29:15.161
Young Master,

29:15.221 --> 29:16.160
the Lieutenant He was...

29:16.161 --> 29:17.160
She must have hated me

29:17.161 --> 29:18.881
because I borrowed troops

29:20.482 --> 29:22.002
from Jieshuo.

29:27.282 --> 29:29.242
She can hate if she wants.

29:30.442 --> 29:33.002
As long as I'm with her,

29:33.762 --> 29:35.602
I can slowly persuade her.

29:36.641 --> 29:39.121
Sooner or later, she'll change her mind.

29:46.841 --> 29:49.161
The place where Ying and I are going

29:50.202 --> 29:52.002
is beautiful.

29:53.282 --> 29:55.481
She'll surely like it.

29:57.202 --> 29:59.082
Both of us will stay there

30:00.002 --> 30:02.602
and live a carefree and leisurely life.

30:06.121 --> 30:08.201
Have you prepared

30:09.282 --> 30:11.042
the snacks she likes?

30:15.801 --> 30:18.121
Once Ying and I are there,

30:19.002 --> 30:21.921
no one will get in our way anymore.

30:32.401 --> 30:33.401
Mister Shiqi.

30:34.081 --> 30:35.720
Mister Shiqi, we have good news.

30:35.720 --> 30:37.880
What's that piece of good news
that makes you this happy?

30:37.880 --> 30:38.921
Miss Cui has sent someone

30:38.922 --> 30:40.481
to invite you to a meeting
outside the city.

30:41.321 --> 30:42.360
What did I tell you?

30:42.361 --> 30:43.961
Miss Cui must be looking for you

30:43.962 --> 30:45.762
to discuss this betrothal.

30:45.922 --> 30:47.721
You two like each other.

30:47.722 --> 30:48.800
This time, Miss Cui

30:48.801 --> 30:50.810
even took the initiative
to submit a memorial to His Majesty.

30:50.922 --> 30:51.721
For a young lady

30:51.722 --> 30:54.401
to take such a step is not easy.

30:54.801 --> 30:57.761
Regardless of any quarrels or disagreements
you had in the past,

30:57.762 --> 30:59.160
now that you'll meet,

30:59.161 --> 31:01.281
make sure to reconcile

31:01.282 --> 31:03.161
and marry her.

31:06.321 --> 31:08.961
Mister Shiqi, what's wrong?

31:12.922 --> 31:14.362
If she chooses me,

31:14.561 --> 31:15.762
there's no need to meet.

31:16.682 --> 31:18.002
Since she wants to meet me,

31:18.682 --> 31:20.161
I fear there might be some discord.

31:42.682 --> 31:44.602
Wonderland is still beautiful.

31:48.722 --> 31:49.681
Ying,

31:50.321 --> 31:51.681
back at Tong Pass,

31:51.922 --> 31:53.802
you asked us to think
about it individually.

31:54.801 --> 31:56.641
The Great General submitted a petition,

31:57.962 --> 31:59.201
and I initially thought

31:59.601 --> 32:01.641
you were unwilling to marry Lord Qi.

32:02.442 --> 32:04.562
That's why you had to submit
that memorial.

32:05.161 --> 32:07.082
Life is like a game of chess.

32:08.321 --> 32:10.401
No one can navigate it alone.

32:11.081 --> 32:13.322
I'm my father's only daughter.

32:13.962 --> 32:15.802
I'm bound to attract
the coveting desires of others.

32:18.202 --> 32:19.762
So, are you willing to marry me?

32:30.361 --> 32:32.441
My heart is more than willing.

32:33.321 --> 32:35.002
But what about your two elder brothers?

32:35.161 --> 32:36.881
Will they let it happen?

32:39.121 --> 32:40.121
I told you

32:40.922 --> 32:42.842
I'm not interested
in crown prince's position.

32:43.401 --> 32:45.001
I will find the great imperial grandson

32:45.002 --> 32:46.842
and have my father declare him
the crown prince,

32:47.121 --> 32:48.961
leaving my brothers with no hope.

32:49.722 --> 32:51.080
Do you think your brothers

32:51.080 --> 32:52.840
will willingly accept
the great imperial grandson

32:52.840 --> 32:53.721
as the crown prince?

32:53.722 --> 32:56.201
After the great imperial grandson
moves into the Eastern Palace,

32:56.361 --> 32:58.001
can he survive for even a year or so?

32:58.002 --> 32:59.082
With me around,

32:59.401 --> 33:00.521
I will ensure his safety

33:00.522 --> 33:01.360
in the Eastern Palace.

33:01.361 --> 33:02.320
Even if you can protect

33:02.321 --> 33:03.961
the great imperial grandson in court,

33:03.962 --> 33:06.522
can you guarantee absolute security?

33:07.161 --> 33:08.120
You're Lord Qin

33:08.121 --> 33:09.481
with military power in your hands.

33:09.482 --> 33:11.241
When your brothers frame you

33:11.241 --> 33:13.320
and the great imperial grandson
for usurping the throne,

33:13.321 --> 33:14.802
how are you going to explain that?

33:14.962 --> 33:16.441
Will you relinquish your military power

33:16.442 --> 33:17.881
to prove your innocence?

33:17.962 --> 33:20.320
Then who's going to protect
the great imperial grandson after that?

33:21.161 --> 33:22.880
Even if you can bring
the great imperial grandson

33:22.880 --> 33:23.880
back to Laolan Pass,

33:23.880 --> 33:25.120
your simple-minded father

33:25.121 --> 33:26.800
may order you to take your own life

33:26.801 --> 33:28.160
after being instigated by others.

33:28.161 --> 33:29.281
Will you comply

33:29.282 --> 33:30.362
or rebel when that time comes?

33:31.121 --> 33:32.560
When you are in a desperate situation,

33:32.561 --> 33:34.522
how will you protect
the great imperial grandson?

33:35.881 --> 33:36.961
Shiqi,

33:37.002 --> 33:38.041
I've already calculated

33:38.042 --> 33:38.721
every move for you

33:38.722 --> 33:39.800
in this complex situation.

33:39.801 --> 33:41.041
They are all dead ends.

33:41.042 --> 33:43.160
Entering the Eastern Palace

33:43.161 --> 33:44.961
is your only escape.

33:53.202 --> 33:55.401
I refuse to believe
that this is my only way out.

33:58.962 --> 34:01.721
Can you not always see human nature
as so treacherous?

34:07.681 --> 34:09.521
Over time,

34:10.362 --> 34:12.481
you will find out for yourself

34:12.561 --> 34:14.642
how complex and treacherous

34:14.681 --> 34:16.362
human hearts can be.

34:19.721 --> 34:21.722
So, did you ask me here

34:21.842 --> 34:23.481
just to tell me all this?

34:24.121 --> 34:24.961
Yes.

34:26.962 --> 34:28.322
Do you like me?

34:41.241 --> 34:42.682
One day,

34:42.882 --> 34:44.362
I encountered someone.

34:45.522 --> 34:47.322
He's exceptionally talented

34:47.601 --> 34:49.202
and intelligent.

34:50.842 --> 34:51.881
He's unlike anyone

34:51.882 --> 34:53.202
I've met before.

34:54.322 --> 34:55.961
The first time meeting,

34:55.962 --> 34:57.682
we had a tough fight.

34:58.522 --> 34:59.881
When we met the second time,

35:00.081 --> 35:02.242
I kicked him into a well.

35:03.442 --> 35:04.961
But at that moment,

35:05.442 --> 35:06.842
I knew

35:08.601 --> 35:10.202
I liked him.

35:13.362 --> 35:14.642
Even though

35:15.362 --> 35:17.762
I've never liked anyone before

35:18.161 --> 35:20.481
or know

35:20.561 --> 35:22.282
what it feels like,

35:22.561 --> 35:24.682
I'm certain

35:25.522 --> 35:27.242
I like him.

35:28.721 --> 35:31.041
Whether he's Shiqi from Laolan Pass

35:31.482 --> 35:33.162
or Lord Qin,

35:34.121 --> 35:38.722
whether he's a commoner,
the imperial grandson, or the crown prince,

35:40.721 --> 35:42.961
I just like him as a person.

35:52.322 --> 35:53.401
You like me

35:53.882 --> 35:55.322
and I like you too.

35:56.042 --> 35:57.961
Why can't you marry me?

36:04.442 --> 36:05.881
Please go back, Your Highness.

36:06.442 --> 36:08.081
Perhaps after some time,

36:08.442 --> 36:10.081
you'll understand

36:10.522 --> 36:12.080
that it's not about Lord Qin

36:12.081 --> 36:13.601
wanting to return

36:14.241 --> 36:16.122
to Laolan Pass

36:16.402 --> 36:17.722
and live as Shiqi.

36:18.121 --> 36:20.122
But it's just that Lord Qin

36:20.161 --> 36:22.642
cannot avoid becoming the crown prince
at the Eastern Palace.

36:31.362 --> 36:32.961
If I refused to be the crown prince,

36:34.241 --> 36:36.282
would you refuse to marry me?

36:44.402 --> 36:46.162
If I say yes,

36:49.281 --> 36:51.601
would it make you feel better,
Your Highness?

37:00.922 --> 37:03.242
If Mister Shiqi marries Miss Cui,

37:03.442 --> 37:05.001
then she'll stay in the capital.

37:05.142 --> 37:06.295
Then you would also stay

37:06.922 --> 37:08.762
in the capital, right?

37:09.842 --> 37:11.802
Well, that's not certain.

37:11.962 --> 37:13.401
Why not?

37:13.401 --> 37:15.080
If Miss Cui already stays
in the capital,

37:15.081 --> 37:16.322
where else can you go?

37:17.882 --> 37:18.961
Maybe

37:18.962 --> 37:20.240
our Great General

37:20.241 --> 37:22.881
won't agree to marry
our young lady to Lord Qin.

37:22.882 --> 37:24.282
That's impossible.

37:24.522 --> 37:25.240
Your Great General

37:25.241 --> 37:26.921
already submitted a memorial

37:26.922 --> 37:29.600
to let Miss Cui choose her husband.

37:29.601 --> 37:30.841
Isn't it obvious

37:30.842 --> 37:32.361
that she'll choose Mister Shiqi

37:32.362 --> 37:33.722
as her husband?

37:33.882 --> 37:36.080
Moreover, they agreed to meet today,

37:36.081 --> 37:38.001
probably to discuss the wedding.

37:40.161 --> 37:41.321
You're weird.

37:41.322 --> 37:42.321
What does my young lady

37:42.322 --> 37:44.560
and Lord Qin's wedding discussion

37:44.561 --> 37:46.842
have anything to do with us?

37:52.362 --> 37:53.202
Taozi.

37:53.362 --> 37:53.881
What?

37:53.882 --> 37:54.961
I like you.

37:55.002 --> 37:56.601
I want to be with you all the time.

37:56.641 --> 37:57.282
Are...

37:58.641 --> 38:00.242
Are you willing to?

38:04.081 --> 38:05.322
Well...

38:08.402 --> 38:09.682
What happened?

38:10.681 --> 38:11.921
Why is Lord Qin

38:11.922 --> 38:13.802
suddenly leaving on his horse?

38:14.002 --> 38:15.601
My young lady is still there.

38:47.802 --> 38:49.240
did you tell Lord Qin just now?

38:49.241 --> 38:51.162
Why did you suddenly leave on bad terms?

38:53.922 --> 38:55.280
What does that mean?

38:55.281 --> 38:57.322
Didn't he come here
to discuss the betrothal?

38:57.442 --> 38:58.200
What happened?

38:58.201 --> 38:59.200
Don't tell me

38:59.201 --> 39:00.762
he doesn't want to marry you anymore.

39:02.241 --> 39:04.401
He's just not willing
to be the crown prince.

39:04.842 --> 39:06.601
But he doesn't understand

39:06.882 --> 39:08.521
that if he doesn't become
the crown prince,

39:08.522 --> 39:09.361
he might not be able

39:09.362 --> 39:11.722
to save even his own life.

39:12.081 --> 39:13.802
How can he marry me?

39:14.161 --> 39:15.881
What's wrong with him?

39:15.882 --> 39:17.321
He clearly likes you so much,

39:17.322 --> 39:19.441
to the extent of giving up his own life.

39:19.802 --> 39:21.280
Is it harder for him

39:21.281 --> 39:23.722
to be the crown prince
than to lose his life?

Look.

39:39.641 --> 39:42.601
There are natural orders to follow,

39:43.042 --> 39:44.601
It's getting dark,

and it's raining now, of all time.

Isn't that Lord Qin?

40:30.962 --> 40:32.640
It's so early in the morning.

40:32.641 --> 40:35.162
Why is he rushing back
from outside the city?

40:38.882 --> 40:42.682
He seems a little distraught.

40:42.721 --> 40:45.081
I wonder what happened.

40:54.281 --> 40:55.081
Your Highness!

40:56.002 --> 40:56.921
Your Highness.

40:57.721 --> 40:59.282
Something happened
at Lord Xin's residence.

40:59.561 --> 41:00.322
What happened?

41:00.402 --> 41:02.401
There was a fire
at Lord Xin's residence last night.

41:02.442 --> 41:04.881
Consort Xin has passed away.

41:06.402 --> 41:07.401
What?

41:08.161 --> 41:09.200
Is this true?

41:09.201 --> 41:10.481
It's absolutely true.

41:11.042 --> 41:12.122
No wonder

41:12.122 --> 41:14.601
there was a sudden fire
at Lord Xin's residence last night.

41:14.641 --> 41:15.521
My poor sister-in-law,

41:15.522 --> 41:17.160
along with all the maids and servants

41:17.161 --> 41:17.881
failed to escape.

41:17.882 --> 41:19.361
All of them perished in the flames.

41:19.362 --> 41:21.720
It turns out
someone deliberately set fire.

41:21.721 --> 41:23.881
Our spy at Lord Xin's residence saw

41:23.882 --> 41:25.680
that no one escaped,

41:25.681 --> 41:26.961
which made him suspicious.

41:26.962 --> 41:28.280
So, it took some effort

41:28.281 --> 41:29.441
to investigate the matter.

41:29.522 --> 41:30.600
Something seems to be amiss

41:30.601 --> 41:32.001
at the Consort Xin's courtyard.

41:32.201 --> 41:33.280
It also took some time

41:33.281 --> 41:34.521
for people to put out the fire.

41:34.721 --> 41:35.680
This incident

41:35.681 --> 41:37.162
was certainly arson,

41:37.201 --> 41:38.722
not an accidental fire.

41:38.922 --> 41:40.200
We just don't know

41:40.201 --> 41:41.601
who did it.

41:41.641 --> 41:42.801
I never expected

41:42.802 --> 41:43.640
the vast courtyard

41:43.641 --> 41:44.881
behind Lord Xin's Residence

41:44.882 --> 41:46.441
would be burnt to ashes.

41:46.601 --> 41:47.520
The Consort Xin

41:47.520 --> 41:49.480
and all the maids and servants
in the entire courtyard

41:49.480 --> 41:50.842
didn't manage to escape.

41:50.922 --> 41:51.880
Something's not right.

41:53.802 --> 41:55.122
What's not right?

41:55.482 --> 41:57.122
A lord's residence has regulations.

41:57.641 --> 41:58.720
Lord Xin's Residence

41:58.721 --> 42:00.801
was renovated
from the former Lord Jin's Residence.

42:00.802 --> 42:02.842
The pillars were made
of precious golden nanmu wood.

42:03.241 --> 42:05.122
It's very sturdy.

42:05.922 --> 42:08.642
Even the golden nanmu wood
turned into charcoal.

42:09.241 --> 42:11.202
But the bricks
on the nearby courtyard wall

42:11.281 --> 42:13.041
are not charred.

42:14.962 --> 42:16.481
It also rained last night.

42:17.042 --> 42:19.202
Yet, they couldn't
put out the fire in time.

42:19.522 --> 42:21.881
None of this adds up.

42:24.402 --> 42:25.561
Shiqi,

42:25.761 --> 42:27.162
do you mean...

42:28.402 --> 42:29.881
It must be arson

42:30.002 --> 42:30.760
or someone poured oil

42:30.761 --> 42:32.521
or used some kind
of inflammable substance.

42:33.081 --> 42:34.560
Otherwise, even the golden nanmu wood

42:34.561 --> 42:37.001
can't turn into charcoal
in such a short time.

42:45.121 --> 42:46.722
Since it's arson,

42:47.842 --> 42:49.521
Sister-in-law's death

42:50.042 --> 42:51.561
has hidden motives.

42:52.522 --> 42:55.280
Who could set fire
to Consort Xin's backyard

42:55.281 --> 42:57.362
and control the servants?

42:57.482 --> 42:58.401
Coincidentally,

42:58.402 --> 43:00.001
I asked Jun to help me

43:00.002 --> 43:02.441
regarding the betrothal with Miss Cui
a few days ago.

43:03.322 --> 43:04.842
Who else could it be?

43:06.442 --> 43:07.921
Are you suggesting

43:08.482 --> 43:10.202
that Lord Xin is behind this?

43:11.641 --> 43:13.240
My elder brother dared

43:13.241 --> 43:14.921
to burn his own wife to death.

43:14.922 --> 43:16.160
Clearly, he's targeting

43:16.161 --> 43:18.561
Cui Yi's proposal to choose a son-in-law.

43:18.601 --> 43:19.640
In that case,

43:19.641 --> 43:20.841
he must also want to fight

43:20.842 --> 43:22.001
for Miss Cui

43:22.002 --> 43:23.561
and won't help me anymore.

43:25.561 --> 43:26.521
Your Highness,

43:27.522 --> 43:29.842
isn't this our chance?

43:32.121 --> 43:33.481
You're right.

43:33.482 --> 43:34.921
If Father finds out,

43:34.922 --> 43:36.441
Jun won't be able
to marry Miss Cui.

43:36.442 --> 43:38.120
My chances of winning
will be even greater.

43:38.120 --> 43:39.380
Your Highness, you're wise indeed.

43:44.522 --> 43:46.001
I believe in a few days,

43:46.002 --> 43:48.282
Ni will also become suspicious
of this matter.

43:48.442 --> 43:50.481
By then, I must lend him

43:50.482 --> 43:52.120
a helping hand.

43:52.121 --> 43:53.881
After all, his feelings for sister-in-law

43:53.882 --> 43:56.041
were the deepest back in the day,
and he admired her the most.

43:56.042 --> 43:56.841
If he finds out

43:56.842 --> 43:58.441
Jun is responsible
for sister-in-law's death,

43:58.442 --> 43:59.720
he'll surely report it to Father.

43:59.721 --> 44:01.520
Then, Father will conduct
a thorough investigation.

44:01.520 --> 44:02.361
By then, Jun

44:02.362 --> 44:04.282
will be in big trouble.

44:05.442 --> 44:07.401
Lord Xin is really ruthless.

44:07.402 --> 44:08.722
Do you think

44:08.882 --> 44:10.722
it's Lord Xin's doing?

44:11.482 --> 44:13.401
Who else could it be but him?

44:14.681 --> 44:16.081
I never expected him

44:16.721 --> 44:19.361
to kill his own wife.

44:19.362 --> 44:21.481
That's the imperial family.

44:21.561 --> 44:23.240
Family members harming each other,

44:23.241 --> 44:24.921
siblings killing each other.

44:24.962 --> 44:27.362
Even if he killed his wife,

44:27.522 --> 44:29.682
it's not something new.

44:32.561 --> 44:33.481
Father,

44:34.922 --> 44:36.322
I want to go to Xichang.

44:37.281 --> 44:39.202
What do you want to do in Xichang?

44:39.922 --> 44:41.601
Lord Xin killed his wife

44:41.641 --> 44:43.122
just to marry me.

44:43.402 --> 44:45.080
I want to see

44:45.081 --> 44:46.841
how he will fight

44:46.842 --> 44:48.481
with Lord Qi.

44:51.362 --> 44:53.282
You actually want to see

44:53.842 --> 44:55.842
how Lord Qin will react, right?

45:00.241 --> 45:01.200
Young Lady,

45:01.201 --> 45:04.561
are we visiting nanny of Lord Qin today?

45:04.842 --> 45:06.401
Cui Yi submitted a memorial,

45:06.482 --> 45:09.081
wanting to choose a son-in-law
among the princes.

45:09.442 --> 45:10.760
This memorial

45:10.761 --> 45:12.122
is quite strange.

45:12.402 --> 45:14.041
What's strange about it?

45:15.402 --> 45:16.401
I once saw

45:16.402 --> 45:18.401
the original text of this memorial.

45:18.962 --> 45:20.361
If Cui Yi submitted it

45:20.362 --> 45:22.481
to marry his daughter to Lord Qin,

45:22.482 --> 45:24.642
he would undoubtedly
use different wordings,

45:25.161 --> 45:28.001
and there could be subtle hints in the text.

45:28.522 --> 45:29.921
But there weren't any.

45:30.761 --> 45:32.640
If Cui Yi didn't submit the memorial

45:32.641 --> 45:35.041
to marry his daughter to Lord Qin,

45:35.442 --> 45:36.760
there might have been

45:36.761 --> 45:38.842
another plan behind it.

45:39.442 --> 45:41.200
So that's why you're going

45:41.201 --> 45:43.001
to Lord Qin's residence today.

45:43.241 --> 45:45.601
This morning,
I saw Lord Qin entering the city,

45:45.962 --> 45:47.961
seemingly soaked from a night of rain.

45:49.761 --> 45:51.881
He's usually a carefree person,

45:52.641 --> 45:54.001
and almost never had such

45:54.002 --> 45:55.162
an appearance.

45:56.761 --> 45:57.680
I think

45:57.681 --> 45:59.722
he must have encountered
an unexpected turn of events.

46:00.042 --> 46:01.282
And this may be related

46:01.601 --> 46:02.521
to the memorial

46:02.522 --> 46:04.081
the Cui family submitted.
