01:43.847 --> 01:45.847
Li Ni didn't enter Luoyang City
with his troops.

01:45.850 --> 01:46.870
Instead, they set up camp.

01:46.927 --> 01:48.168
Why do you think they did so?

01:48.729 --> 01:49.889
According to the fold

01:50.009 --> 01:51.169
that Li Ni had sent to Father,

01:51.170 --> 01:53.010
it was inconvenient
for the army to enter the city.

01:53.048 --> 01:53.820
He set up camp outside

01:53.820 --> 01:55.520
so that it's easier to conduct
military operations.

01:55.889 --> 01:58.860
It's obvious that he suffered defeat
and wasn't willing to enter the city.

01:58.968 --> 02:01.169
He still dared to submit a fold
to Father

02:01.328 --> 02:03.449
saying that he wanted
to reclaim Xichang.

02:04.449 --> 02:04.929
Jun,

02:05.089 --> 02:06.968
Young Master Cui is dead.

02:07.128 --> 02:09.128
Cui Yi must be enraged by now.

02:09.420 --> 02:10.620
It's good that he's outside the city.

02:10.649 --> 02:11.249
If not,

02:11.369 --> 02:12.809
Luoyang City will be implicated

02:12.968 --> 02:14.288
when the Cui Army arrives.

02:17.776 --> 02:19.378
(To Uncle)

02:34.249 --> 02:36.209
Father, since His Highness
had sent you a letter,

02:36.408 --> 02:37.489
I assume he found a way

02:37.649 --> 02:39.128
to conquer Xichang.

02:40.089 --> 02:41.809
In the letter, Li Ni hoped

02:42.008 --> 02:43.128
that I could

02:43.288 --> 02:45.249
contact the old subjects
of the previous rule

02:45.688 --> 02:47.888
and spread the news of
Sun Jing's failed conquest

02:48.049 --> 02:49.049
in Baiyue.

02:49.329 --> 02:50.489
He wanted the people to think

02:50.520 --> 02:52.008
that Sun Jing suffered a major defeat.

02:52.128 --> 02:53.929
It's best if it causes
a hike in food prices.

02:54.329 --> 02:56.649
This way, people's hearts
will be shaken.

02:57.529 --> 02:58.209
Father,

02:58.448 --> 03:00.929
what do you think His Highness is up to?

03:02.288 --> 03:03.888
He's crafty and adaptable to change.

03:04.089 --> 03:05.769
I can't tell either.

03:06.448 --> 03:07.249
However,

03:07.568 --> 03:09.769
it seems that he intends to
cause chaos in the city.

03:09.968 --> 03:11.609
He'll get his opportunity

03:11.769 --> 03:13.209
when the city is in chaos.

You want to play chess?

06:30.568 --> 06:31.809
I can get you a new set.

06:33.440 --> 06:36.208
Why are you going through
all this effort just to make them yourself?

06:40.128 --> 06:41.688
Young Master loved playing chess.

06:44.489 --> 06:46.088
I once promised him

06:47.169 --> 06:48.568
that I would make him

06:50.049 --> 06:51.809
a set of chess pieces.

06:52.888 --> 06:53.489
Ying,

06:53.929 --> 06:55.039
Father finally promised us

06:55.040 --> 06:56.720
that we could lead an army
and leave Yingzhou.

06:57.088 --> 06:58.768
Opportunities slip away quickly.

06:58.929 --> 07:00.809
We mustn't miss out on this opportunity.

07:00.929 --> 07:01.768
Really?

07:02.648 --> 07:03.328
Ying,

07:03.929 --> 07:04.489
I know.

07:04.969 --> 07:06.448
This is what you always desired.

07:06.809 --> 07:08.249
Ever since Sun Jing started a revolt,

07:08.849 --> 07:10.208
you wanted to

07:10.369 --> 07:11.249
vie for the world

07:11.409 --> 07:12.369
and dominate the realm.

07:13.049 --> 07:13.609
Young Master,

07:13.768 --> 07:15.088
you do know me well.

07:15.448 --> 07:16.809
Ying, your goal

07:17.088 --> 07:18.768
is my goal.

07:19.249 --> 07:21.448
As long as there's something
you wish to achieve,

07:21.888 --> 07:23.809
I'll definitely do my best

07:23.810 --> 07:24.729
to help you achieve it.

07:25.410 --> 07:26.369
(Thank you, Young Master.)

07:28.049 --> 07:29.888
(Since I've fulfilled
my end of the bargain,)

07:30.489 --> 07:31.809
(you should remember)

07:32.120 --> 07:33.208
your end of the bargain too.

07:33.409 --> 07:34.448
Of course I do.

07:34.729 --> 07:35.609
Young Master,

07:35.660 --> 07:36.980
you wanted
a set of chess pieces.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.010
Young Master, don't worry.

07:38.169 --> 07:39.680
I'll definitely make you an entire set

07:39.688 --> 07:41.128
when I have free time

07:41.249 --> 07:41.929
out there.

07:42.010 --> 07:42.768
That's unnecessary.

07:42.969 --> 07:45.568
I just need you
to select the jade pieces personally.

07:45.729 --> 07:47.609
It's the same when I tell
the jade craftsman

07:47.900 --> 07:48.609
to make it for me.

07:48.809 --> 07:49.609
That won't do.

07:49.768 --> 07:51.088
I must make them myself.

07:51.249 --> 07:52.448
They represent my sincerity.

07:58.448 --> 07:59.729
But now,

08:03.008 --> 08:04.128
I'm afraid I have no chance

08:04.249 --> 08:05.888
to give it to him myself.

08:18.849 --> 08:20.289
For my sake,

08:21.420 --> 08:23.110
Young Master took the shot
and fell into the river.

08:23.249 --> 08:24.929
I can't even recover his body.

08:25.568 --> 08:26.648
Now,

08:26.809 --> 08:28.208
I can only erect a tomb for him

08:28.740 --> 08:30.088
and make him a set of chess pieces

08:30.289 --> 08:31.409
as a burial gift.

08:32.569 --> 08:33.408
What?

08:35.449 --> 08:36.928
Can't I even do that now?

08:43.528 --> 08:45.048
Must you say such hurtful words?

08:46.008 --> 08:47.648
Hurtful?

08:48.609 --> 08:50.128
Young Master died for my sake.

08:53.168 --> 08:54.849
Shouldn't I grieve his loss?

08:57.128 --> 08:58.969
Shouldn't I be upset that he's gone?

09:02.329 --> 09:05.489
So, you're still blaming me
for not saving your young master, right?

09:05.648 --> 09:06.209
That's right!

09:07.768 --> 09:09.048
So, you're heartbroken,

09:09.900 --> 09:11.800
and you wish that you could
die with him, right?

09:11.808 --> 09:12.408
That's right!

09:14.609 --> 09:15.408
Li Ni,

09:16.008 --> 09:17.008
listen up.

09:17.408 --> 09:19.089
I was lying to you all along.

09:22.729 --> 09:23.329
I fell for

09:23.449 --> 09:24.648
Young Master long ago.

09:28.449 --> 09:30.408
I was lying to you from the start.

09:33.008 --> 09:34.249
I was the one who duped you

09:35.288 --> 09:36.689
into heading to Xichang.

09:37.768 --> 09:39.128
As for the incident in Tong Pass,

09:39.768 --> 09:40.369
I plotted that

09:40.528 --> 09:41.969
with Young Master long ago.

09:42.969 --> 09:44.288
I did so to trick you.

09:45.449 --> 09:47.969
I wanted to trick you
so that you would suffer a major defeat.

09:53.768 --> 09:55.768
But now, Young Master is dead.

09:56.689 --> 09:57.569
I've lost all hope.

09:57.729 --> 09:59.168
I don't want to deceive you anymore!

10:00.128 --> 10:00.768
Come on.

10:01.569 --> 10:02.888
Just kill me!

10:16.048 --> 10:16.768
You truly know

10:16.888 --> 10:18.569
how to break my heart.

10:19.689 --> 10:21.249
That's why you said that to me.

10:23.808 --> 10:25.449
I know I maligned you

10:27.380 --> 10:28.209
and broke your heart.

10:28.209 --> 10:30.369
That's why you're saying that
to break my heart.

10:31.369 --> 10:31.808
Am I right?

10:36.489 --> 10:38.048
I'm heartbroken?

10:40.089 --> 10:41.609
Why should I be heartbroken?

10:42.449 --> 10:43.729
I was lying to you all along.

10:43.888 --> 10:45.449
Why should I be heartbroken?

10:51.528 --> 10:52.768
I was lying to you.

10:58.689 --> 11:00.808
I never fancied you.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.648
Everything was fake.

11:04.008 --> 11:05.489
But my feelings for you are true.

11:08.369 --> 11:11.808
I don't care if you fancy
your young master or not.

11:13.168 --> 11:14.648
I have genuine feelings for you.

11:17.048 --> 11:18.449
When I first met you,

11:18.648 --> 11:19.928
you kicked me into the well.

11:20.768 --> 11:21.969
Back then, I thought

11:22.449 --> 11:24.369
that I must get back

11:25.729 --> 11:26.648
at the person

11:26.808 --> 11:28.209
who kicked me into the well.

11:31.648 --> 11:33.128
But after that, we met again.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.900
Initially, I could seek revenge against you.

11:36.969 --> 11:37.928
But I didn't do so.

11:39.369 --> 11:40.288
I hesitated.

11:42.128 --> 11:43.408
I didn't know why either.

11:49.249 --> 11:50.569
When we were in Taiqing Palace,

11:53.329 --> 11:54.528
I made a bet with you.

11:55.768 --> 11:57.329
In the end, I lost to you.

11:58.609 --> 11:59.489
But in my heart...

12:01.569 --> 12:03.048
In my heart,

12:05.128 --> 12:06.570
there was an indescribable happiness.

12:08.249 --> 12:09.569
It's because I finally know

12:10.528 --> 12:12.329
that you fancy me too.

12:14.249 --> 12:15.528
You had feelings for me too.

12:18.449 --> 12:20.449
So, when you said
that you were lying to me,

12:20.840 --> 12:22.180
that you didn't fancy me,

12:22.920 --> 12:24.689
that everything in the past was fake,

12:25.800 --> 12:26.969
I would never believe in them.

12:29.528 --> 12:30.689
It's because

12:31.240 --> 12:32.410
your feelings for me are true.

12:48.249 --> 12:49.928
No matter how angry you are at me,

12:51.008 --> 12:52.609
don't take it out on your body.

12:54.408 --> 12:55.648
You're injured.

12:56.120 --> 12:57.320
Remember to take your medicine.

12:58.408 --> 12:59.689
Don't skip your meals.

13:48.408 --> 13:49.648
Why isn't it sprouting yet?

13:50.120 --> 13:51.770
Could it be that
the weather is too cold?

13:53.168 --> 13:53.648
Taozi!

13:54.288 --> 13:55.008
Long time no see.

13:55.089 --> 13:56.168
We've finally met again.

13:59.168 --> 13:59.648
Taozi.

14:02.849 --> 14:04.369
Taozi, why are you ignoring me again?

14:06.648 --> 14:07.569
Let me help you out.

14:14.369 --> 14:15.408
Taozi?

14:15.928 --> 14:16.449
Taozi?

14:32.168 --> 14:33.840
(Milk Candy)
Seems like that mouse was here again.

14:37.569 --> 14:39.249
You throw a tantrum

14:39.449 --> 14:40.928
whenever he's here.

14:41.520 --> 14:43.500
One's liver suffers whenever
one throws a tantrum.

14:43.689 --> 14:45.048
I'm worried that your injury

14:45.168 --> 14:46.569
might never heal, you know?

14:49.329 --> 14:50.528
Since you feel terrible,

14:50.768 --> 14:53.209
why don't you have some milk candy?

14:59.609 --> 15:00.928
That mouse is something else.

15:01.168 --> 15:02.609
He knew that you would be furious

15:02.729 --> 15:03.689
when you see him.

15:04.180 --> 15:05.609
How dare he deliver the candy here?

15:10.249 --> 15:12.849
Why don't you take your medicine?

15:20.420 --> 15:21.569
What's wrong with your hands?

15:22.089 --> 15:24.008
It's nothing. It's just some scratches.

15:24.089 --> 15:25.729
Why did you do that?

15:27.180 --> 15:28.999
Even if Young Master
is no longer with us now,

15:29.000 --> 15:30.810
I'm sure he'll be heartbroken
when he sees you

15:30.849 --> 15:32.689
in this state from above.

15:43.528 --> 15:43.928
Here.

15:49.729 --> 15:50.489
Did you

15:51.888 --> 15:53.249
argue with Li Ni just now?

15:56.408 --> 15:57.128
That's right.

15:58.808 --> 16:00.209
I told him off.

16:01.768 --> 16:03.329
I said something mean to him.

16:05.849 --> 16:07.048
But I didn't expect him

16:09.329 --> 16:10.249
to...

16:13.168 --> 16:14.209
What is it?

16:18.528 --> 16:19.089
It's nothing.

16:20.648 --> 16:21.489
Lieutenant He,

16:22.528 --> 16:23.609
I know you're still angry

16:23.609 --> 16:24.689
that Li Ni didn't trust you.

16:25.209 --> 16:27.400
You're angry that he did nothing
when we were in danger.

16:29.168 --> 16:30.390
You feel heartbroken and guilty

16:31.329 --> 16:33.449
about Young Master's death.

16:33.849 --> 16:35.089
But you can't just

16:35.089 --> 16:36.249
keep this up.

16:36.528 --> 16:38.489
You have to take care of your health too,

16:38.928 --> 16:39.648
am I right?

16:45.329 --> 16:47.729
I got it. Don't worry about me.

16:48.928 --> 16:50.408
We're stuck here.

16:51.209 --> 16:52.408
I'm sure Great General Cui Yi

16:52.528 --> 16:53.928
is worried about us.

17:00.609 --> 17:02.048
We have to think of a way

17:02.768 --> 17:04.089
to escape to Yingzhou.

17:07.328 --> 17:07.969
Lieutenant He,

17:08.729 --> 17:09.449
why don't we

17:09.689 --> 17:11.568
start with Li Ni?

17:11.880 --> 17:13.520
Take advantage of him
to escape to Yingzhou.

18:10.449 --> 18:12.929
The little mouse wants
to steal some lamp oil.

18:13.008 --> 18:15.729
He failed. Thus, he tried
to steal some honey.

18:24.528 --> 18:25.848
You only took your medicine

18:25.929 --> 18:27.008
without taking dinner.

18:27.328 --> 18:29.370
If you keep this up,
your health will be affected.

18:30.169 --> 18:31.568
I brought you a bottle of honey.

18:31.720 --> 18:32.768
I made you a flatbread too.

18:33.449 --> 18:34.449
Why don't you have some?

18:38.300 --> 18:39.848
Your Highness, thanks for your concern.

18:40.729 --> 18:41.528
But I'm not hungry.

18:44.889 --> 18:46.129
Even if you're mad at me,

18:46.368 --> 18:47.649
you can't just starve yourself.

18:49.940 --> 18:52.608
Your Highness, why are you so concerned
about a prisoner like me?

18:53.568 --> 18:54.568
It's late now.

18:54.870 --> 18:56.110
I'm a woman while you're a man.

18:56.449 --> 18:58.249
It's inappropriate for you to be here.

18:58.528 --> 18:59.689
You should leave.

19:01.729 --> 19:02.489
I just want you

19:02.608 --> 19:04.008
to stay here for a few more days.

19:04.169 --> 19:05.608
You're not a prisoner.

19:09.729 --> 19:12.409
Your Highness, you don't need
to make up such a grand excuse.

19:13.368 --> 19:15.008
Young Master is dead.

19:15.449 --> 19:16.808
I'm just a woman.

19:17.169 --> 19:18.288
You can't use me

19:18.368 --> 19:19.368
to coerce the Cui Army

19:19.409 --> 19:20.969
to do your bidding.

19:21.649 --> 19:23.288
Since you said I wasn't a prisoner,

19:23.608 --> 19:25.048
why aren't you willing to release me?

19:25.568 --> 19:26.729
It's because you're injured.

19:27.008 --> 19:28.729
I would've died anyway

19:29.048 --> 19:31.008
had you arrived one second later.

19:31.729 --> 19:34.008
There's no need for you
to be concerned about my injury.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.368
Even if you're not doing it for me,

19:42.720 --> 19:44.048
you should do it for Taozi's sake.

19:44.929 --> 19:46.249
She's anxious about

19:46.729 --> 19:48.088
your condition every day.

19:49.169 --> 19:50.929
You're not taking your medicine nor meals.

19:51.568 --> 19:53.400
If this continues,
your health will be affected.

19:53.409 --> 19:54.409
Don't try to blackmail me

19:54.449 --> 19:56.088
with the people beside me.

19:56.528 --> 19:58.008
Taozi and I are like sisters.

19:58.568 --> 20:00.088
We know each other's conditions

20:00.209 --> 20:01.889
the best.

20:02.969 --> 20:04.608
It has nothing to do with you.

20:10.969 --> 20:12.409
Since you're still mad at me,

20:12.969 --> 20:14.008
I'll leave first.

20:15.129 --> 20:16.449
Don't sleep with anger, okay?

20:17.450 --> 20:18.420
It's bad for your health.

22:05.249 --> 22:05.889
Taozi!

22:07.209 --> 22:07.729
Taozi.

22:08.929 --> 22:09.929
Let me carry it for you.

22:12.008 --> 22:12.649
Taozi,

22:13.568 --> 22:14.969
are you still angry at me?

22:15.649 --> 22:17.209
Can you please talk to me?

22:22.620 --> 22:24.100
Taozi, are you going to gather herbs?

22:24.209 --> 22:25.169
Let me tag along.

22:26.328 --> 22:26.929
Taozi.

22:28.249 --> 22:30.368
His Majesty conferred me
the title of Lord Qin,

22:30.920 --> 22:32.288
appointed me as Commander-in-Chief,

22:32.290 --> 22:33.620
and ordered me to reclaim Xichang?

22:34.660 --> 22:36.300
The imperial edict
arrived here last night.

22:36.300 --> 22:38.000
Not only did he confer
the title of Lord Qin to you,

22:38.008 --> 22:40.288
but he also conferred the titles
of Lord Qi and Lord Xin

22:40.460 --> 22:42.209
to Lord Kuaiji and
Lord Linzi respectively.

22:45.328 --> 22:47.409
They're putting me on open fire here.

22:48.129 --> 22:49.729
If I fail to reclaim Xichang,

22:51.209 --> 22:52.368
I'll be punished, huh?

22:53.129 --> 22:53.889
Shiqi,

22:54.328 --> 22:55.568
why don't you refuse it?

22:55.689 --> 22:56.249
Refuse what?

22:56.620 --> 22:58.010
Since His Majesty already
issued an edict,

22:58.768 --> 22:59.969
I'll be Lord Qin then.

23:00.568 --> 23:00.768
Now,

23:00.889 --> 23:02.449
as the Commander-in-Chief,

23:02.848 --> 23:04.209
I can dispatch the loyalists

23:04.768 --> 23:06.608
officially

23:06.929 --> 23:08.209
to reclaim Xichang.

23:09.729 --> 23:11.689
This time, I'll leave the city to you guys.

23:11.889 --> 23:13.449
Don't worry, Mister Shiqi.

23:13.620 --> 23:15.328
We'll definitely follow
your instructions

23:15.649 --> 23:16.729
and flip Xichang

23:17.008 --> 23:18.209
upside down.

23:18.729 --> 23:19.249
Precisely.

23:19.409 --> 23:21.528
We might not be good at other things,

23:21.649 --> 23:23.328
but flipping places upside down

23:23.489 --> 23:24.449
is our expertise.

23:25.080 --> 23:27.000
It's a shame that
I haven't fully recovered yet.

23:27.008 --> 23:28.260
I can't join you guys this time.

23:28.489 --> 23:29.288
I'll go ahead

23:29.368 --> 23:30.729
and do your share for you.

23:32.328 --> 23:33.568
There's an undercurrent surging.

23:33.920 --> 23:35.020
We can't tell friends from foes.

23:35.129 --> 23:37.088
You guys must be careful.

23:37.288 --> 23:38.489
Must act cautiously.

23:38.568 --> 23:41.088
And, you must ensure your own safety.

23:41.768 --> 23:42.689
Don't worry.

23:43.169 --> 23:44.288
Once we take down Xichang,

23:44.608 --> 23:46.249
we'll come back and drink with you.

23:46.368 --> 23:46.808
Let's drink!

23:46.810 --> 23:48.980
We'll conquer Xichang
and drink together when we're back!

23:49.008 --> 23:49.810
Let's drink together!

23:49.889 --> 23:50.288
Let's go.

23:51.209 --> 23:51.929
Prime Minister Gu,

23:52.368 --> 23:54.249
wild rumors
have been spreading in the city.

23:54.449 --> 23:55.929
There's a hike in food prices,

23:55.940 --> 23:57.088
and the people are panicking.

23:57.120 --> 23:58.409
They say that the army
Grand Governor

23:58.528 --> 24:00.249
had sent to conquer Baiyue
suffered a major defeat.

24:00.449 --> 24:01.409
They were also saying

24:01.410 --> 24:04.060
that Li Ni, the son of the fake emperor,
was conferred the title of Lord Qin.

24:04.088 --> 24:05.729
And now, he's going to attack Xichang.

24:05.969 --> 24:07.729
People say that he was born

24:08.649 --> 24:10.169
to jinx Grand Governor.

24:11.088 --> 24:12.209
What else did you hear?

24:13.008 --> 24:14.768
They even said Lord Qin
sent his spies here

24:14.929 --> 24:16.088
to poison the well water.

24:16.249 --> 24:17.110
People are panicking.

24:17.169 --> 24:18.580
They dare not consume
well water anymore.

24:18.608 --> 24:19.328
Some even said

24:19.449 --> 24:20.768
that the granary was empty.

24:20.889 --> 24:22.088
There was no food inside.

24:22.328 --> 24:22.969
They said

24:23.048 --> 24:24.368
the army that was sent to Baiyue

24:24.489 --> 24:25.649
had already taken all of them.

24:26.449 --> 24:27.169
Once...

24:27.328 --> 24:28.729
Once Lord Qin surrounds our city,

24:28.848 --> 24:29.969
the people in the city

24:30.249 --> 24:31.969
will starve to death.

24:32.649 --> 24:34.169
All right. I understand. You may leave.

24:34.449 --> 24:36.929
Order our servants to guard the door.
Don't let anyone out.

24:36.950 --> 24:37.729
Yes, Prime Minister.

24:43.608 --> 24:44.808
Do you understand now?

24:46.328 --> 24:48.020
Is Lord Qin trying
to cause a ruckus here?

24:48.088 --> 24:48.848
That's right.

24:49.249 --> 24:51.409
Lord Qin wants to sow discord
among the people.

24:52.008 --> 24:55.048
Now, let's see what the person
inside the palace will do

24:55.608 --> 24:57.048
to deal with this situation.

24:57.528 --> 25:00.088
Capture all those
who were spreading the rumors

25:00.209 --> 25:00.768
and kill them.

25:01.129 --> 25:01.848
Grand Governor,

25:02.020 --> 25:03.920
I'm afraid the rumor-spreaders
have an ulterior motive.

25:03.920 --> 25:05.180
That's why we have to kill them.

25:06.808 --> 25:07.889
Not only will I kill them,

25:08.420 --> 25:10.500
but I'll also exterminate
their families and clans.

25:11.689 --> 25:13.129
I'll see

25:13.489 --> 25:14.449
who's daring enough

25:14.528 --> 25:16.129
to do something like this after this.

25:17.820 --> 25:18.608
Yes, Grand Governor.

25:32.328 --> 25:34.929
Why are you so early today?

25:49.088 --> 25:51.088
You didn't like to
use rouge in the past.

25:51.449 --> 25:53.209
What's with the sudden fondness?

25:56.848 --> 25:58.368
Maybe it was because of

25:59.088 --> 26:00.169
the white hair

26:00.689 --> 26:02.568
I saw in the mirror that day.

26:15.489 --> 26:16.209
Jing,

26:16.568 --> 26:18.048
are you troubled by court affairs?

26:18.620 --> 26:20.088
You don't need to tell me about them.

26:20.969 --> 26:22.489
Let's go and take a walk.

26:26.889 --> 26:28.129
Ever since I took up arms,

26:28.409 --> 26:29.729
I always thought

26:30.169 --> 26:31.288
that the world

26:31.489 --> 26:32.649
could be conquered easily.

26:33.489 --> 26:34.729
I never expected

26:35.129 --> 26:36.848
Li Ni to lead the Zhenxi Army

26:37.008 --> 26:38.608
all the way here.

26:39.328 --> 26:40.689
He's targeting Xichang now.

26:41.608 --> 26:43.808
Tong Pass is the gate
to the two capitals.

26:44.129 --> 26:45.489
As long as we own Tong Pass,

26:45.848 --> 26:48.048
it's useless even if

26:48.368 --> 26:49.889
Li Ni owns Luoyang.

26:52.088 --> 26:53.568
Cui Yi is devious and cunning.

26:53.969 --> 26:55.969
If he joins hands with Li Ni,

26:56.889 --> 26:58.969
it'll be tough for us.

27:00.048 --> 27:00.929
That won't happen.

27:01.409 --> 27:03.368
Cui Yi has an ulterior motive.

27:03.768 --> 27:06.209
If not, he wouldn't have sent his army
out of Yingzhou.

27:06.929 --> 27:08.528
Li Ni is the son of the fake emperor.

27:08.649 --> 27:10.489
They harbor different motives.

27:10.729 --> 27:12.489
They won't join hands that easily.

27:18.088 --> 27:20.209
I shouldn't have told you about that.

27:21.288 --> 27:22.889
Come, let's play some polo.

27:23.848 --> 27:24.409
Okay.

28:32.088 --> 28:33.889
What? You plan

28:33.920 --> 28:35.460
to ignore me for the rest of your life?

28:36.368 --> 28:37.808
Lord Qin, you're overthinking it.

28:38.288 --> 28:40.729
You were just conferred
the title of Lord Qin.

28:41.328 --> 28:43.608
There are plenty of people
who wish to gain your favor.

28:44.889 --> 28:46.489
Your Highness, you don't need
to care about me.

28:48.920 --> 28:50.670
In the past, you call me
the imperial grandson.

28:50.889 --> 28:52.129
Now, you call me Your Highness.

28:52.689 --> 28:53.848
Aren't you willing

28:54.449 --> 28:55.889
to call me Shiqi again?

29:02.689 --> 29:04.249
This place is the best.

29:18.768 --> 29:20.169
When I was young,

29:20.848 --> 29:22.409
my nanny said

29:22.969 --> 29:24.768
that I should make a bamboo dragonfly

29:26.328 --> 29:27.848
whenever I have a wish.

29:30.008 --> 29:31.528
My wish will be granted

29:32.568 --> 29:34.048
when it falls to the ground.

29:36.088 --> 29:37.528
Back then,

29:38.768 --> 29:40.368
I wanted to see my mother very badly.

29:41.249 --> 29:43.008
Everyone had a mother, except for me.

29:43.969 --> 29:44.568
Thus,

29:44.729 --> 29:46.929
I made plenty of bamboo dragonflies.

29:47.608 --> 29:50.100
I scaled to the top of the wall
and released them one by one.

29:51.048 --> 29:53.409
When I was done,

29:53.528 --> 29:57.328
I found out that my nanny was saying that
just to coax me.

29:58.969 --> 30:00.288
That wish of mine

30:01.328 --> 30:03.008
could never be fulfilled

30:03.320 --> 30:04.840
no matter how many
bamboo dragonflies I made.

30:08.449 --> 30:09.368
People say

30:09.568 --> 30:10.608
that one wouldn't repeat

30:10.729 --> 30:12.568
their silly mistakes again.

30:14.320 --> 30:16.368
Even so, I still made plenty of
bamboo dragonflies.

30:19.249 --> 30:20.008
Because it's you.

30:21.848 --> 30:22.608
For you,

30:23.889 --> 30:26.929
I'm willing to do all the silly things
in the world.

30:35.649 --> 30:36.209
Ying,

30:38.520 --> 30:39.608
can you please forgive me?

30:42.169 --> 30:42.969
I promise,

30:44.209 --> 30:45.489
from now on,

30:46.368 --> 30:48.008
I won't misunderstand your intention.

30:54.209 --> 30:55.780
If so, you should stop trapping me here.

30:57.129 --> 30:59.649
Release me and Taozi back to Yingzhou.

31:03.328 --> 31:04.568
I can't allow that.

31:08.048 --> 31:09.129
If so,

31:09.689 --> 31:10.848
I have nothing to say to you.

31:32.528 --> 31:35.129
You're still in the mood to fish, huh?

31:36.929 --> 31:37.489
What's wrong?

31:37.608 --> 31:38.969
Is Cui Yi's main army here?

31:40.129 --> 31:40.889
Not yet.

31:41.048 --> 31:42.969
They're taking their sweet time.

31:46.689 --> 31:47.528
Shiqi,

31:48.249 --> 31:49.409
don't you think

31:49.580 --> 31:50.768
Cui Yi has an ulterior motive?

31:51.169 --> 31:53.169
The situation in Xichang
is ever-changing.

31:53.328 --> 31:55.008
If he doesn't hurry up,

31:55.129 --> 31:56.449
I'm afraid we'll miss out

31:56.568 --> 31:57.729
on this opportunity.

31:58.249 --> 31:59.489
I coerced him into doing this.

31:59.500 --> 32:00.768
Of course he's unhappy to do so.

32:01.288 --> 32:01.808
Besides,

32:02.249 --> 32:03.649
he has the number advantage.

32:03.740 --> 32:05.600
But he has to try his best
to conquer the city.

32:05.620 --> 32:08.300
Do you think he'll be willing to hurry
when he's in that situation?

32:09.528 --> 32:11.008
I just received news.

32:11.120 --> 32:12.449
Great General is already...

32:27.368 --> 32:29.088
This is a rare opportunity indeed.

32:30.048 --> 32:30.929
Maybe we can

32:31.449 --> 32:32.768
use this chance to escape.

32:34.048 --> 32:35.568
Lieutenant He, I knew you could

32:35.729 --> 32:37.088
think of a great idea.

32:38.328 --> 32:40.929
However, we need to plan this out.

32:41.608 --> 32:43.808
Li Ni is very intelligent.

32:44.489 --> 32:45.969
It's difficult for us to escape

32:47.409 --> 32:49.008
without a thorough plan.

32:53.249 --> 32:54.048
Where's Li Ni?

32:55.008 --> 32:57.209
Ear has been following me all day long.

32:57.368 --> 32:58.409
He kept yapping

32:58.568 --> 32:59.929
because I ignored him.

33:00.489 --> 33:02.209
He said that Li Ni was
fishing by the lake

33:02.368 --> 33:03.969
this afternoon.

33:04.129 --> 33:04.808
He even asked me

33:04.820 --> 33:06.300
if I wanted to have some fresh fish.

33:07.768 --> 33:09.129
He was fishing?

33:17.088 --> 33:17.969
Who's there?

33:18.528 --> 33:20.008
Your Highness, it's me.

33:20.169 --> 33:20.808
Taozi.

33:21.249 --> 33:22.008
Please come in.

33:25.288 --> 33:26.729
Your Highness, General Pei Yuan.

33:27.328 --> 33:27.929
Your Highness,

33:28.288 --> 33:30.169
Lieutenant He
was taking medicine every day.

33:30.288 --> 33:31.568
She didn't take much food either.

33:31.689 --> 33:32.808
She has lost a lot of weight.

33:33.048 --> 33:34.568
You knew that too.

33:34.969 --> 33:36.449
After she took her medicine,

33:36.620 --> 33:38.710
she suddenly said
she wanted to have fish ball soup.

33:38.848 --> 33:40.568
I asked the kitchen about it.

33:41.048 --> 33:43.528
But they said the marketplace
was closed today.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.368
They only bought some vegetables.

33:45.768 --> 33:46.370
Coincidentally,

33:46.489 --> 33:47.328
I saw some fish

33:47.489 --> 33:48.889
in the bucket.

33:49.729 --> 33:50.768
But they said

33:51.288 --> 33:52.528
those were the fish

33:52.689 --> 33:53.889
you caught by the lake today.

33:54.169 --> 33:55.910
I dare not use them
without your permission.

33:56.328 --> 33:58.568
That's why I came here
to ask for your permission.

33:58.570 --> 33:59.839
Finally she has an appetite,

33:59.840 --> 34:00.980
I'll make the fish ball soup.

34:01.249 --> 34:02.409
No need for that.

34:02.528 --> 34:03.129
I can make it.

34:03.288 --> 34:03.729
It's fine.

34:03.740 --> 34:05.129
It takes skills to make fish balls.

34:05.180 --> 34:05.729
Let me do it.

34:06.209 --> 34:07.328
If that's the case,

34:07.568 --> 34:08.928
Your Highness, please go ahead.

34:17.448 --> 34:18.928
Taozi, you're back.

34:19.089 --> 34:20.368
Yeah, I'm back.

34:23.368 --> 34:24.488
Try it while it's hot.

34:24.620 --> 34:25.870
It'll smell fishy when it gets cold.

34:47.529 --> 34:47.928
Is it nice?

34:50.368 --> 34:51.408
It's pretty fresh.

34:54.689 --> 34:55.368
You should

34:55.808 --> 34:57.569
rest and recuperate.

34:58.689 --> 35:00.009
Even if you're mad at me,

35:00.729 --> 35:02.209
you have to cherish your body.

35:08.049 --> 35:08.689
In the future,

35:09.009 --> 35:10.328
just tell me what you want

35:10.689 --> 35:11.689
and what you wish to eat.

35:12.169 --> 35:13.408
I'll get them for you.

35:19.120 --> 35:20.900
Aren't you afraid that
I'll use this chance

35:21.089 --> 35:22.848
to relay a message back home

35:23.968 --> 35:25.488
and escape from this place?

35:27.488 --> 35:28.768
Even if you do escape from here,

35:29.249 --> 35:30.009
I can intercept you

35:30.129 --> 35:31.288
and bring you back.

35:32.009 --> 35:33.009
If you don't believe me,

35:33.600 --> 35:34.689
feel free to give it a try.

35:38.009 --> 35:39.529
The army Sun Jing had sent to Baiyue

35:39.540 --> 35:40.729
didn't really suffer a defeat.

35:40.820 --> 35:42.620
Only his army in Yingzhou
suffered a defeat.

35:43.448 --> 35:45.649
I'm afraid Sun Jing will recall

35:45.768 --> 35:46.808
his army in Baiyue.

35:47.009 --> 35:48.848
And, he owns Tong Pass.

35:49.488 --> 35:51.169
You're caught in a pincer attack.

35:51.569 --> 35:52.649
Unless

35:52.768 --> 35:53.768
you can conquer Xichang

35:53.928 --> 35:55.209
before the army in Baiyue

35:55.368 --> 35:56.768
comes back.

35:57.448 --> 35:58.569
However, I'm afraid

35:58.729 --> 35:59.808
the Zhenxi Army

36:00.640 --> 36:02.320
is incapable of such a feat
at the moment.

36:07.408 --> 36:08.448
Excellent point.

36:09.408 --> 36:09.888
However,

36:09.940 --> 36:10.968
I still won't release you.

36:18.529 --> 36:20.368
Your Highness, you do know me well, huh?

36:23.209 --> 36:24.609
You know me well too.

36:27.288 --> 36:28.169
We're the same.

36:34.020 --> 36:35.990
Taozi, have you managed to
buy everything you need?

36:36.529 --> 36:39.129
That incident was so long ago.

36:39.180 --> 36:40.209
Can you please talk to me?

36:40.340 --> 36:41.288
I'll do anything for you

36:41.448 --> 36:42.529
as long as you talk to me.

36:43.140 --> 36:44.609
Don't you know why I'm ignoring you?

36:44.729 --> 36:46.169
Back then, you were just observing us

36:46.220 --> 36:47.820
when Lieutenant He and I
were under pursuit.

36:47.848 --> 36:48.968
You guys ignored us.

36:49.129 --> 36:50.448
You're just like Lord Qin.

36:50.609 --> 36:52.089
You guys are heartless, indifferent,

36:52.140 --> 36:52.808
and cold-hearted!

36:52.968 --> 36:53.529
That's not it.

36:54.129 --> 36:55.448
I was anxious too.

36:55.569 --> 36:56.990
I wanted to rush down
and save you.

36:57.569 --> 36:59.488
But it was a military order. I...

37:00.169 --> 37:01.689
I had no choice.

37:02.049 --> 37:02.808
Besides,

37:02.968 --> 37:04.249
the soldiers of the Zhenxi Army

37:04.368 --> 37:05.808
never go against military orders.

37:06.209 --> 37:06.729
Your excuses.

37:06.888 --> 37:08.009
I'm not making up excuses.

37:09.249 --> 37:10.129
That day,

37:10.689 --> 37:12.529
Mister Shiqi knew what he was doing.

37:12.768 --> 37:14.368
He had his bow drawn.

37:14.770 --> 37:16.888
He wouldn't just stand there
and see you hurt.

37:18.848 --> 37:19.328
Taozi.

37:19.420 --> 37:21.570
What exactly do you want me to do
before you'll forgive me?

37:21.609 --> 37:23.009
Why don't I gather herbs with you

37:23.169 --> 37:24.689
or buy something nice for you?

37:25.120 --> 37:26.110
Do you want to have pig ears?

37:26.169 --> 37:28.488
I'll do anything you like
as long as you stop ignoring me.

37:28.888 --> 37:29.729
Really?

37:30.169 --> 37:31.529
Anything?

37:34.488 --> 37:37.488
Except for releasing you
and Lieutenant He.

37:41.129 --> 37:42.689
You have good hearing, right?

37:43.848 --> 37:44.848
Don't tell me

37:44.968 --> 37:46.249
you want to have my ears?

37:46.368 --> 37:47.049
Nonsense.

37:47.569 --> 37:48.928
Who wants to have your stupid ears?

37:50.848 --> 37:51.649
I just

37:52.368 --> 37:53.089
want you

37:53.120 --> 37:54.129
to make a whistle for me.

37:54.649 --> 37:55.649
A whistle?

37:57.009 --> 37:59.649
I want you to make a whistle
that only you can hear.

37:59.848 --> 38:00.609
If I need your help

38:00.710 --> 38:01.529
for any emergencies,

38:01.689 --> 38:02.968
I'll blow the whistle.

38:03.368 --> 38:05.089
That sounds difficult.

38:06.768 --> 38:07.448
But don't worry.

38:07.460 --> 38:08.670
I can definitely make it for you.

38:11.129 --> 38:12.089
That's more like it.

38:12.968 --> 38:15.569
So, Taozi, you'll stop ignoring me, right?

38:15.848 --> 38:17.049
You are not angry at me, right?

38:17.249 --> 38:18.288
That depends on my mood.

38:27.820 --> 38:29.770
Mister Shiqi went to see
Lieutenant He just now.

38:30.009 --> 38:31.328
She shut the door on him again.

38:33.368 --> 38:34.448
He deserved it.

38:37.049 --> 38:37.848
Miss Taozi,

38:38.209 --> 38:39.288
actually, Mister Shiqi

38:39.448 --> 38:40.768
is very nice to Lieutenant He.

38:41.169 --> 38:42.448
Why don't you speak up

38:42.609 --> 38:43.649
for him in front of her

38:43.808 --> 38:44.768
and try to appease her?

38:45.328 --> 38:45.928
If he was

38:46.089 --> 38:47.328
truly nice to Lieutenant He,

38:47.529 --> 38:50.209
he wouldn't just use these random herbs
to brew her medicine.

38:50.729 --> 38:53.129
Even now, Lieutenant He hasn't recovered
from her injuries.

38:53.448 --> 38:55.368
Look. What are these?

38:56.089 --> 38:57.169
Miss Taozi, don't be angry.

38:57.448 --> 38:58.768
Well, give me the prescription.

38:58.770 --> 38:59.500
I'll buy the herbs.

38:59.569 --> 39:00.609
If I can't buy them nearby,

39:00.768 --> 39:02.928
I'll buy them in Xichang or Luoyang, OK?

39:04.488 --> 39:05.569
You said so yourself.

39:06.928 --> 39:07.249
Fine.

39:07.729 --> 39:09.408
I'll get you the prescription right now.

39:09.569 --> 39:10.129
Okay.

39:11.488 --> 39:13.328
Keep fanning it. Don't stop.

39:23.020 --> 39:23.810
Where are you going?

39:24.520 --> 39:26.520
Lieutenant He hasn't recovered
from her injuries.

39:26.520 --> 39:27.408
The herbs here are limited.

39:27.408 --> 39:29.049
So Miss Taozi
gave me a prescription.

39:29.120 --> 39:30.328
She told me to buy these herbs.

39:30.368 --> 39:31.768
By the way, Taozi also said

39:31.848 --> 39:33.070
that she would speak up for you

39:33.089 --> 39:34.488
in front of Lieutenant He

39:34.609 --> 39:36.209
as long as I buy all of these herbs.

39:40.529 --> 39:41.529
Dragon bone,

39:42.129 --> 39:43.928
Forsythia suspensa,

39:44.129 --> 39:45.609
Aesculus hippocastanum,

39:46.049 --> 39:48.009
pumice, ephedra,

39:48.328 --> 39:49.448
and Fritillaria pallidiflora?

39:50.689 --> 39:51.808
That's a lot of herbs.

39:51.968 --> 39:53.408
And, she even designated the stores.

39:53.460 --> 39:55.249
The stores are far away
from each other too.

39:55.888 --> 39:56.569
Taozi said

39:56.729 --> 39:58.609
she knew which store sold the best herbs.

39:59.169 --> 39:59.729
If I try

39:59.848 --> 40:00.649
to brush her off,

40:00.808 --> 40:02.649
she won't let me off when she finds out.

40:03.808 --> 40:04.529
Good job.

40:04.928 --> 40:05.569
I'll go now.

40:09.089 --> 40:09.968
Taozi didn't tell you

40:09.980 --> 40:10.968
to buy them one by one, right?

40:11.209 --> 40:12.009
Isn't it faster

40:12.009 --> 40:12.649
if you get help?

40:13.448 --> 40:14.839
This is a request from Miss Taozi.

40:14.840 --> 40:16.390
How could I tell other people to do it?

40:16.569 --> 40:18.009
Besides, it's just a few stores.

40:18.169 --> 40:19.870
I travel fast.
It won't take up much time.

40:20.529 --> 40:21.310
I'll be leaving now.

40:33.649 --> 40:36.009
(Huichun Apothecary)
Huichen Apothecary? I finally found it.

40:37.808 --> 40:38.249
Shopkeeper,

40:38.368 --> 40:39.209
I want to buy this.

40:39.368 --> 40:39.848
Aesculus hippocastanum.

40:39.929 --> 40:42.358
(Huichun Apothecary)
(Aesculus hippocastanum)

40:49.368 --> 40:50.110
Here are your herbs.

40:50.169 --> 40:50.768
Thank you.

40:53.848 --> 40:55.110
Here's the money. Keep the change.

40:55.968 --> 40:56.768
Take care.

41:07.888 --> 41:08.488
Miss Taozi!

41:09.408 --> 41:09.968
Miss Taozi!

41:10.488 --> 41:11.380
I bought all the herbs.

41:11.649 --> 41:12.808
That quickly?

41:13.808 --> 41:15.569
Did you skive and skip some of them?

41:15.768 --> 41:16.609
I didn't!

41:16.808 --> 41:17.780
I bought them one by one

41:17.888 --> 41:19.009
according to your list.

41:19.768 --> 41:20.448
Let me see.

41:26.920 --> 41:27.620
What do you think?

41:31.729 --> 41:32.848
Miss Taozi,

41:33.249 --> 41:33.928
can you please

41:34.089 --> 41:35.169
speak up for Mister Shiqi

41:35.328 --> 41:36.729
in front of Lieutenant He then?

41:37.169 --> 41:37.768
Fine.

41:38.288 --> 41:39.928
I'll do it on account of these herbs.

41:42.488 --> 41:43.808
Let me check them again.

41:43.968 --> 41:44.288
Go ahead.

41:51.609 --> 41:52.209
Ying.

41:54.689 --> 41:56.089
The weather is pretty good today.

41:56.328 --> 41:57.488
I got you some osmanthus.

42:00.368 --> 42:01.089
Ying?

42:03.689 --> 42:04.089
Ying?

42:11.408 --> 42:12.928
I'll leave it at your doorstep then.

Lieutenant He,

44:02.890 --> 44:04.249
we have fresh flowers again today.

44:04.320 --> 44:05.888
I'll swap yesterday's bouquet
for this one.

44:14.928 --> 44:17.448
Lieutenant He,
you should stop being mad.

44:18.209 --> 44:20.129
I think Lord Qin...

44:20.488 --> 44:20.968
No.

44:21.209 --> 44:23.368
I mean he's apologizing to you
sincerely this time.

44:23.808 --> 44:24.888
Didn't he say

44:25.049 --> 44:26.649
that he wasn't supposed to trust you?

44:27.808 --> 44:29.129
Actually, Cui Li was the one

44:29.328 --> 44:31.089
behind Young Master's passing.

44:31.529 --> 44:32.808
It's not his fault.

44:33.808 --> 44:34.848
Strange.

44:35.169 --> 44:36.488
Why are you

44:36.848 --> 44:38.249
speaking up for him today?

44:38.928 --> 44:39.928
Lieutenant He,

44:40.249 --> 44:42.209
I'm doing this for your sake.

44:42.768 --> 44:44.089
I think Lord Qin

44:44.249 --> 44:46.129
is truly nice to you.

44:46.368 --> 44:48.768
He even sent his men
to buy herbs from various stores.

44:49.288 --> 44:51.209
He still wants to keep you company here

44:51.328 --> 44:52.768
even if you show him a long face

44:52.928 --> 44:54.009
every day.

44:57.848 --> 44:58.729
Actually,

44:58.740 --> 45:00.729
I know that he's sincere
in apologizing to me too.

45:01.888 --> 45:03.529
I should stop being mad at him.

45:04.328 --> 45:05.649
I wouldn't be this angry

45:05.928 --> 45:07.689
if someone else did this.

45:08.649 --> 45:09.488
But...

45:12.448 --> 45:13.490
To me, he's different from

45:14.649 --> 45:16.209
other people.

45:20.129 --> 45:21.729
I see.

45:22.649 --> 45:24.129
I was wondering why.

45:25.320 --> 45:26.700
I'll get angry if you keep that up.

45:28.089 --> 45:28.689
It's my fault.

45:28.848 --> 45:29.569
Don't be angry.

45:30.129 --> 45:31.400
I'll change your flowers for you.

45:33.368 --> 45:33.928
Great General.

45:36.049 --> 45:36.968
We've received news.

45:36.999 --> 45:38.827
(Xichang)

45:38.848 --> 45:39.408
Mister Shiqi!

45:39.689 --> 45:40.288
Mister Shiqi!

45:41.328 --> 45:42.089
Mister Shiqi!

45:43.609 --> 45:45.328
Mister Shiqi, I have good news.

45:45.768 --> 45:46.448
What is it?

45:47.768 --> 45:48.368
Taozi said

45:48.529 --> 45:49.649
she finally convinced

45:49.808 --> 45:50.808
Lieutenant He to see you

45:50.968 --> 45:52.569
after all the effort she has put in.

45:52.968 --> 45:55.169
Tonight, they'll hold a banquet
beside the lotus pond.

45:55.368 --> 45:57.408
By then, Taozi will act accordingly

45:57.420 --> 45:59.010
and give you two
a chance to speak in private.

45:59.928 --> 46:01.328
By the way, Taozi also said

46:01.488 --> 46:02.249
that all women

46:02.408 --> 46:03.529
are soft-hearted.

46:03.689 --> 46:05.209
By then, you need to apologize to her

46:05.368 --> 46:06.089
sincerely.

46:06.288 --> 46:07.009
This way,

46:07.169 --> 46:08.368
Lieutenant He can be appeased.

46:12.049 --> 46:13.288
Thank Miss Taozi for me.

46:14.049 --> 46:14.488
Okay.
