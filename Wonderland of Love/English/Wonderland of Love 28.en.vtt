01:41.214 --> 01:42.956
=Episode 28=

01:43.973 --> 01:45.894
(Lord Qin's Residence)
After receiving your invitation,

01:45.926 --> 01:47.925
I realized you have such good taste.

01:47.926 --> 01:49.125
You mentioned

01:49.126 --> 01:50.804
you received two good teas

01:50.805 --> 01:52.005
and invited me to taste them.

01:52.006 --> 01:53.444
So, I came here

01:53.445 --> 01:54.964
without hesitation.

01:54.965 --> 01:56.285
You're so kind, Prime Minister Gu.

01:56.286 --> 01:58.845
These two plum bonsai trees

01:58.846 --> 02:01.044
were sent by Pei Yuan

02:01.045 --> 02:02.365
after he reached Bizhou.

02:02.366 --> 02:03.365
They may not be valuable,

02:03.366 --> 02:04.684
but they're unique.

02:04.685 --> 02:06.125
Martial people like me

02:06.126 --> 02:07.884
don't know about plants.

02:07.885 --> 02:09.404
But I heard

02:09.405 --> 02:11.526
you're an excellent painter of plum
in the capital.

02:11.565 --> 02:12.325
So,

02:12.326 --> 02:15.485
I think having these two bonsai trees
with me is a waste.

02:15.486 --> 02:16.205
Later,

02:16.206 --> 02:18.085
I'll deliver them to your mansion.

02:18.086 --> 02:19.045
I see.

02:20.565 --> 02:22.524
I really appreciate it.

02:22.525 --> 02:24.246
I shall receive your gift.

02:26.525 --> 02:27.365
By the way,

02:27.366 --> 02:29.165
the daughter of Cui Yi,

02:29.166 --> 02:30.445
Miss Cui,

02:30.446 --> 02:32.244
she requested an audience
with His Majesty.

02:32.245 --> 02:34.885
Has the Ministry of Rites
sorted this out?

02:36.206 --> 02:38.325
Not only it's a controversy
in the Ministry of Rites,

02:38.326 --> 02:39.365
but now

02:39.366 --> 02:41.725
even the Ministry of War
has gotten involved.

02:41.926 --> 02:42.964
They argue

02:42.965 --> 02:45.925
that the Cui Army defends
against the enemy at the frontier,

02:45.926 --> 02:48.765
Miss Cui should be deemed as
the descendant of Great General Cui

02:48.766 --> 02:50.285
to see His Majesty.

02:50.486 --> 02:52.165
However, the Ministry of Rites
disapproves of it,

02:52.166 --> 02:53.804
saying that there's
no precedent for this.

02:53.805 --> 02:55.445
While the Ministry of Revenue claims

02:55.446 --> 02:58.565
that the military provisions and funds
of the Cui Army

02:58.845 --> 03:01.045
weren't allocated
by the Ministry of Revenue,

03:01.046 --> 03:03.045
instead, they're deducted
from the tax revenues

03:03.046 --> 03:04.445
of Pingliang and Weiyang.

03:04.446 --> 03:06.365
They insist on settling this account.

03:06.366 --> 03:07.385
As of now,

03:07.386 --> 03:09.244
the six ministries have already
started a great dispute

03:09.245 --> 03:12.845
even before Miss Cui meets His Majesty.

03:15.805 --> 03:17.045
Actually,

03:17.046 --> 03:19.485
Ministry of Rites disagrees

03:19.486 --> 03:22.445
with Miss Cui seeking an audience

03:22.446 --> 03:24.005
because there isn't any precedent, right?

03:24.446 --> 03:26.485
Miss Cui's mother, Madam He,

03:26.486 --> 03:28.646
was granted the title Heroic Lady
by the court.

03:29.206 --> 03:31.206
I remember during the Ruijing's reign,

03:31.606 --> 03:34.605
to present an honorary plaque
to Lady of Wise Assistance,

03:34.606 --> 03:36.406
her daughter was summoned

03:36.486 --> 03:37.804
to the court

03:37.805 --> 03:39.165
to receive a gold plaque

03:39.646 --> 03:40.925
from Emperor Shizu

03:40.926 --> 03:42.686
during the court meeting.

03:44.805 --> 03:45.724
Your Highness,

03:45.725 --> 03:47.605
thank you for enlightening me.

03:47.606 --> 03:49.406
I remember this precedent.

03:51.685 --> 03:53.165
In that case,

03:54.046 --> 03:55.284
it should be fine

03:55.285 --> 03:57.766
for Miss Cui to see His Majesty.

04:00.245 --> 04:01.365
I just sent someone

04:01.366 --> 04:03.486
to look for the record.

04:03.565 --> 04:04.806
As expected,

04:04.926 --> 04:06.804
Lord Qin

04:06.805 --> 04:08.806
checked this record a few days ago.

04:09.965 --> 04:12.565
That the daughter of Lady of Wise Assistance
entered the court

04:12.646 --> 04:14.926
was an event from 60 years ago.

04:15.005 --> 04:19.406
Only old officials in
the Ministry of Rites could find that.

04:19.686 --> 04:21.566
Lord Qin actually searched
for the record

04:22.045 --> 04:24.165
for the sake of Miss Cui.

04:24.206 --> 04:25.805
This apparently shows his devotion

04:25.806 --> 04:27.365
to Miss Cui.

04:28.126 --> 04:29.645
For that woman,

04:29.646 --> 04:32.284
he tried every possible means

04:32.285 --> 04:34.725
to fulfill her wish.

04:41.686 --> 04:42.925
Wan.

04:43.326 --> 04:45.365
You're smart.

04:45.525 --> 04:47.964
If your rival is Miss Cui herself,

04:47.965 --> 04:49.205
I believe

04:49.206 --> 04:50.886
you still can give it a try.

04:51.246 --> 04:52.245
But if your rival

04:52.246 --> 04:53.524
isn't Miss Cui,

04:53.525 --> 04:56.646
but rather Lord Qin's devotion for her,

04:57.086 --> 04:58.446
do you think

04:58.686 --> 05:00.845
you stand a chance?

05:05.446 --> 05:07.805
If I concede defeat before even trying,

05:08.326 --> 05:09.044
I don't deserve

05:09.045 --> 05:10.406
to be your daughter.

05:11.086 --> 05:12.886
Besides, nothing is predictable.

05:13.246 --> 05:15.966
While Lord Qin takes a liking
to Miss Cui,

05:16.206 --> 05:19.044
what if Cui Yi is imperious
and disrespects the Emperor

05:19.045 --> 05:20.646
and commits treason?

05:21.126 --> 05:23.406
The entire Cui family
would be eliminated,

05:23.806 --> 05:26.086
let alone marrying off his daughter
to a prince.

05:27.925 --> 05:29.685
As for Cui Yi,

05:29.806 --> 05:32.524
he may be imperious
and disrespectful towards the Emperor,

05:32.525 --> 05:34.886
but he won't

05:36.206 --> 05:37.725
commit to treason.

05:39.246 --> 05:40.285
Father.

05:40.965 --> 05:43.885
Chai Hong, Duke of Fan,
the founding General of the Left Martial Guard,

05:43.886 --> 05:45.685
was accused of treason.

05:45.686 --> 05:47.646
Eventually, he was beheaded
in front of the public.

05:48.246 --> 05:50.085
Even the founding general,

05:50.086 --> 05:52.406
Duke of Fan, could be accused of treason,

05:53.806 --> 05:56.165
why couldn't that happen to Cui Yi?

06:09.485 --> 06:10.526
Young Lady.

06:11.806 --> 06:12.766
Young Lady.

06:12.845 --> 06:14.480
Someone from the Ministry of Rites
came to inform

06:14.480 --> 06:16.080
that you could seek
an audience with His Majesty

06:16.080 --> 06:18.044
on the court meeting three days later.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.045
Really?

06:19.806 --> 06:20.685
It seems

06:20.686 --> 06:22.646
that their dispute has led
to a protocol at last.

06:22.845 --> 06:24.724
They said

06:24.725 --> 06:26.205
it was based

06:26.206 --> 06:28.844
on the previous case of the daughter
of Lady of Wise Assistance.

06:28.845 --> 06:30.484
I'm clueless about that.

06:30.485 --> 06:31.604
Anyway, the conclusion is

06:31.605 --> 06:33.365
that you can meet His Majesty.

06:33.605 --> 06:35.685
It's faster than I expected.

06:35.725 --> 06:37.164
However, I was told

06:37.165 --> 06:38.005
that Prime Minister Gu

06:38.006 --> 06:39.724
went to the Ministry of Rites in person

06:39.725 --> 06:42.604
to search for a record from 60 years ago.

06:42.605 --> 06:44.125
Therefore, the Ministry of Rites

06:44.126 --> 06:45.605
permitted your request in a short time.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.365
A record from 60 years ago?

06:49.086 --> 06:50.966
It must be hard for him to find that.

06:51.326 --> 06:52.364
It seems

06:52.365 --> 06:54.765
that Prime Minister Gu is willing
to try every possible mean

06:54.766 --> 06:56.725
to quell the dispute in court.

06:57.086 --> 06:58.485
By the way, Young Lady,

06:58.605 --> 07:00.325
Ear told me

07:00.326 --> 07:01.724
that a few days ago, Lord Qin also went

07:01.725 --> 07:03.526
to the Ministry of Rites several times.

07:03.806 --> 07:05.805
He went there

07:05.806 --> 07:06.924
to search for case records

07:06.925 --> 07:09.045
of the frontier for several days.

07:09.405 --> 07:10.245
As you know,

07:10.246 --> 07:11.284
those case records

07:11.285 --> 07:13.086
have long been left aside.

07:13.246 --> 07:14.724
They took quite some days to find it

07:14.725 --> 07:16.445
and got themselves dirty all over.

07:16.446 --> 07:18.164
Lord Qin

07:18.165 --> 07:19.765
is insincere.

07:19.766 --> 07:21.205
Even Prime Minister Gu

07:21.206 --> 07:23.165
would look for the records to help us.

07:23.246 --> 07:24.284
While he

07:24.285 --> 07:25.805
only cares about himself

07:25.806 --> 07:27.526
and ignores you.

07:39.566 --> 07:40.404
You...

07:40.405 --> 07:42.446
What's wrong with your attire?

07:42.485 --> 07:43.646
I'm attending the court meeting.

07:44.126 --> 07:46.285
It's been ages since you went for it.

07:46.566 --> 07:47.964
From what I know,

07:47.965 --> 07:49.844
you never persisted in going.

07:49.845 --> 07:51.044
Either you skip the meeting

07:51.045 --> 07:52.685
or feign sickness.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.085
What in the world

07:54.086 --> 07:55.364
woke you up

07:55.365 --> 07:56.805
to attend the court meeting today?

07:56.806 --> 07:58.005
The weather is fine.

07:58.006 --> 07:59.406
So, I decided to go.

07:59.925 --> 08:01.526
The weather is fine?

08:02.165 --> 08:04.284
Do not forget to bring us

08:04.285 --> 08:06.326
some fried quails
to pair with liquor afterward.

08:07.285 --> 08:08.044
Summon

08:08.045 --> 08:09.805
the daughter of Cui Yi,
Great General Pingliang,

08:09.806 --> 08:11.685
Great General Weiyang,

08:11.686 --> 08:14.284
Commander-in-chief of the Shuozhou,

08:14.285 --> 08:15.964
General of the Left,

08:15.965 --> 08:18.284
Cui Lin

08:18.285 --> 08:20.285
into the court.

08:30.525 --> 08:31.645
She's Cui Yi's daughter?

08:31.646 --> 08:32.565
Yes.

08:32.566 --> 08:33.766
It's out of my expectation.

08:52.605 --> 08:55.165
I, Cui Lin, greet Your Majesty.

08:58.125 --> 08:59.606
Rise.

08:59.725 --> 09:00.965
Thank you, Your Majesty.

09:02.765 --> 09:04.285
You insisted

09:04.286 --> 09:06.364
on seeking my audience

09:06.365 --> 09:08.646
on your father's behalf.

09:09.326 --> 09:11.486
Go ahead.

09:12.406 --> 09:15.405
I, Cui Lin, present myself to Your Majesty
on my father's behalf because of Luoyang.

09:15.406 --> 09:17.205
The Cui Army
briefly seized control of it

09:17.206 --> 09:19.726
during the rebellion led by Sun Jing.

09:19.765 --> 09:21.844
Now that the country is in peace

09:21.845 --> 09:24.526
in the early period of your reign,

09:24.645 --> 09:25.925
the Cui Army

09:25.926 --> 09:27.525
will promptly withdraw from Luoyang

09:27.526 --> 09:30.726
and return it to the court.

09:33.125 --> 09:34.325
That's good news.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.805
You were saying

09:39.965 --> 09:42.846
you wanted to return Luoyang to me?

09:43.166 --> 09:44.165
Yes.

09:44.605 --> 09:46.565
Luoyang, belongs to the country.

09:46.566 --> 09:48.445
Naturally, it belongs
to Your Majesty as well.

09:48.526 --> 09:51.165
The Cui Army merely
seized command of it temporarily.

09:51.206 --> 09:53.244
Now that the rebellion has subsided,

09:53.245 --> 09:53.844
the Cui Army

09:53.845 --> 09:55.445
certainly has to withdraw from Luoyang

09:55.446 --> 09:57.886
and return it to the court.

09:58.725 --> 09:59.805
Good.

09:59.965 --> 10:01.246
Very good.

10:03.086 --> 10:04.205
It turns out

10:04.206 --> 10:05.884
this is your intention to meet me.

10:05.885 --> 10:07.124
You should've said it earlier.

10:07.125 --> 10:08.045
Good.

10:08.885 --> 10:09.805
I really adore

10:09.806 --> 10:11.726
straightforward young people like you.

10:13.245 --> 10:14.364
I must tell the Empress

10:14.365 --> 10:15.685
to set up a banquet

10:15.686 --> 10:17.805
to receive you.

10:18.485 --> 10:19.606
Thank you, Your Majesty.

10:34.166 --> 10:35.165
Empress.

10:35.566 --> 10:38.004
When Cui Lin came into the court

10:38.005 --> 10:39.766
in her armor,

10:40.046 --> 10:41.764
I thought to myself

10:41.765 --> 10:44.004
that Cui Yi was a rude man,

10:44.005 --> 10:45.604
his own daughter

10:45.605 --> 10:47.526
must be uncouth as well.

10:47.725 --> 10:49.244
Much to my expectation,

10:49.245 --> 10:51.364
Cui Lin straightaway said

10:51.365 --> 10:54.646
that she wanted
to return Luoyang to the court.

10:56.166 --> 10:57.646
Congratulations.

10:58.326 --> 11:00.085
We get to reclaim Luoyang

11:00.166 --> 11:01.844
without using a soldier.

11:01.845 --> 11:04.165
Advisor Wu said

11:04.166 --> 11:06.604
I'm the emperor

11:06.605 --> 11:07.884
chosen by Heaven.

11:07.885 --> 11:10.925
Naturally, I'm blessed
with great fortune.

11:12.485 --> 11:14.445
Just now, Your Majesty mentioned

11:14.446 --> 11:16.886
about holding a banquet for Miss Cui.

11:17.725 --> 11:20.724
Do you have any expectations
for the banquet?

11:20.725 --> 11:22.405
As grander as possible.

11:22.406 --> 11:24.406
Invite noble ladies.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.445
I want to show Cui Lin

11:26.446 --> 11:29.805
how noble ladies from the capital behave.

11:29.806 --> 11:31.886
I want to break her spirit.

11:32.806 --> 11:33.606
Yes.

11:34.005 --> 11:36.925
The Cui Army is battling at Shuozhou,

11:37.046 --> 11:39.085
while the court is wary of them.

11:39.086 --> 11:40.964
Cui Lin came to the court meeting
on her father's behalf

11:40.965 --> 11:43.244
to return Luoyang.

11:43.245 --> 11:45.165
This move

11:45.166 --> 11:46.486
is bold and straightforward.

11:46.765 --> 11:47.925
Cui Yi

11:47.926 --> 11:49.205
is indeed shrewd.

11:49.206 --> 11:51.325
As expected of a seasoned general.

11:51.965 --> 11:54.325
From what I know about Miss Cui,

11:54.326 --> 11:55.604
I think

11:55.605 --> 11:58.366
perhaps today's action

11:58.485 --> 12:00.246
was suggested by Cui Lin to her father.

12:03.005 --> 12:04.525
Cui Lin

12:04.526 --> 12:06.965
is a surprise.

12:08.245 --> 12:09.685
Father, in your opinion,

12:09.686 --> 12:12.004
has the court permanently dispelled
their suspicion

12:12.005 --> 12:13.764
about Cui Yi,

12:13.765 --> 12:15.526
or is it just temporary?

12:15.965 --> 12:17.965
Just temporary.

12:18.086 --> 12:20.604
Cui Yi is the general
of Pingliang and Weiyang.

12:20.605 --> 12:22.120
He possesses considerable
military power.

12:22.120 --> 12:24.205
How could the court not be wary of him?

12:26.206 --> 12:27.805
Just now, you mentioned

12:27.806 --> 12:29.604
that the Empress intends to hold
a banquet for Miss Cui

12:29.605 --> 12:31.805
and invite noble ladies from the capital
to accompany her.

12:32.166 --> 12:33.085
I believe

12:33.086 --> 12:35.205
I'm qualified to attend the banquet.

12:35.206 --> 12:36.525
Certainly.

12:36.526 --> 12:37.525
If so, I shall

12:37.526 --> 12:38.884
go and have a good look

12:38.885 --> 12:41.406
at Miss Cui.

12:45.245 --> 12:46.285
I thought you'd already

12:46.286 --> 12:48.124
gained some knowledge about her.

12:48.125 --> 12:50.445
It's different now.

12:50.485 --> 12:52.646
She was in the army back then,

12:52.725 --> 12:55.445
but she has come to the court.

13:01.446 --> 13:02.406
Father.

13:02.765 --> 13:04.964
When I saw Miss Cui earlier today,

13:04.965 --> 13:06.884
I was amazed by her appearance.

13:06.885 --> 13:08.644
Besides, she wore the armor,

13:08.645 --> 13:10.085
which made her look even more unique.

13:12.286 --> 13:13.646
I've been thinking

13:14.845 --> 13:17.085
about one thing these days.

13:17.566 --> 13:19.045
Although Cui Yi

13:19.046 --> 13:20.964
has returned Luoyang to me,

13:20.965 --> 13:22.805
but I'm worried

13:23.365 --> 13:25.484
he might bear evil intentions
in the future.

13:25.485 --> 13:26.646
So,

13:26.765 --> 13:29.406
it's necessary to keep him close.

13:30.605 --> 13:32.925
Cui Yi has only one daughter.

13:32.926 --> 13:35.006
If you marry her,

13:35.765 --> 13:40.085
we could reclaim the Cui Army rightfully.

13:40.845 --> 13:41.805
Father, this is brilliant.

13:41.806 --> 13:43.165
I think this is a good idea.

13:43.326 --> 13:44.764
Soon, the Empress

13:44.765 --> 13:47.285
will hold a banquet for Cui Lin.

13:47.845 --> 13:49.325
I asked the Empress

13:49.326 --> 13:50.884
to invite a few noble ladies

13:50.885 --> 13:52.965
to accompany her.

13:53.125 --> 13:55.006
However, by the look of it,

13:55.406 --> 13:57.325
you, the princesses,

13:57.446 --> 13:58.484
and Li Ni

13:58.485 --> 13:59.925
should attend the banquet too.

14:01.206 --> 14:03.406
The rest are just companions.

14:03.566 --> 14:04.606
But for you,

14:05.005 --> 14:07.325
you must assess Cui Lin carefully

14:07.526 --> 14:08.646
to see

14:09.125 --> 14:11.525
if she could be your wife.

14:11.526 --> 14:13.165
No need to force yourself.

14:14.086 --> 14:15.406
Thank you, Father.

14:55.286 --> 14:56.764
I, Cui Lin,

14:56.765 --> 14:58.484
greet Your Majesty.

14:58.485 --> 15:00.006
Rise.

15:00.806 --> 15:03.685
You appeared in the court
with armor on a few days ago.

15:03.686 --> 15:05.805
It's said that you exuded

15:05.806 --> 15:07.205
an impressive aura.

15:07.206 --> 15:08.565
So, I was thinking

15:08.566 --> 15:09.724
of meeting

15:09.725 --> 15:12.406
this female general today.

15:12.765 --> 15:14.445
Unexpectedly,

15:14.446 --> 15:17.724
you put on the maiden's clothes today.

15:17.725 --> 15:20.445
You carry yourself elegantly

15:20.446 --> 15:22.085
and look gorgeous.

15:22.566 --> 15:24.325
You flatter me, Your Majesty.

15:24.965 --> 15:27.445
Don't stand on ceremony. Have a seat.

15:27.725 --> 15:29.006
Thank you, Your Majesty.

15:41.086 --> 15:42.846
We have this banquet

15:42.926 --> 15:45.726
to welcome Miss Cui.

15:46.005 --> 15:48.646
Besides, it's the season
of splendid views.

15:49.086 --> 15:51.244
Miss Cui has been living in Yingzhou.

15:51.245 --> 15:53.006
It's rare for you to come
to the capital.

15:53.245 --> 15:54.484
So, today,

15:54.485 --> 15:57.085
I'll have Lord Qi, Lord Qin,

15:57.086 --> 15:58.724
and other young people

15:58.725 --> 16:01.445
to accompany you.

16:03.926 --> 16:05.884
Let's drink up

16:05.885 --> 16:07.685
as a welcome sign for Miss Cui.

16:13.086 --> 16:14.644
Thank you, Your Majesty.

16:14.645 --> 16:16.526
Thank you, Lord Qi.

16:21.086 --> 16:24.484
Mother, the show
of colored-ball snatching is ready.

16:24.485 --> 16:26.004
Great.

16:26.005 --> 16:27.644
I was worried

16:27.645 --> 16:30.366
I couldn't prepare anything interesting
for you all.

16:30.965 --> 16:33.244
So, Lord Qi specially arranged

16:33.245 --> 16:35.325
an acrobatic troupe from the south.

16:35.806 --> 16:37.285
Miss Cui

16:37.286 --> 16:39.445
and all the guests here,

16:39.446 --> 16:41.445
you may feast your eyes on it.

16:45.885 --> 16:47.646
How considerate of you, Lord Qi.

16:48.446 --> 16:51.644
The colored-ball snatching show
is the new trend.

16:51.645 --> 16:53.124
When the two teams come onstage,

16:53.125 --> 16:55.525
they could only use the silk streamer
as their weapon.

16:55.526 --> 16:56.844
They're allowed to trip, stop,

16:56.845 --> 16:58.525
wrestle, block, or tangle

16:58.526 --> 16:59.846
to halt the rival's action.

17:00.046 --> 17:02.124
The team that first snatches
the colored ball

17:02.125 --> 17:03.285
will be the winner.

17:03.326 --> 17:05.805
Lord Qi is so caring

17:05.806 --> 17:08.005
for Miss Cui.

17:08.246 --> 17:09.805
Of course.

17:09.806 --> 17:12.124
After all, her father commands
military power.

17:12.125 --> 17:13.800
If he manages to get
the Cui family on his side,

17:13.800 --> 17:15.800
he's very likely to secure
the position as the crown prince.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.844
No wonder a general's daughter

17:17.845 --> 17:18.644
dares to request

17:18.645 --> 17:20.525
to choose a prince as her husband.

17:20.885 --> 17:22.566
How daring.

17:22.645 --> 17:23.844
Both teams

17:23.845 --> 17:24.565
have to figure out

17:24.566 --> 17:26.444
how to kick their rival off the stage

17:26.445 --> 17:28.965
while thinking about how to snatch
the colored ball.

17:28.966 --> 17:29.644
At the same time,

17:29.645 --> 17:30.684
they have to watch themselves

17:30.685 --> 17:31.765
from being kicked off the stage.

17:31.766 --> 17:32.924
The show

17:32.925 --> 17:34.326
is exciting.

17:34.486 --> 17:36.286
It sounds very interesting.

17:37.925 --> 17:39.644
It's not fun enough

17:39.645 --> 17:41.045
if we just watch it.

17:41.046 --> 17:43.684
Why don't we make a bet

17:43.685 --> 17:45.204
according to the custom in the capital?

17:45.205 --> 17:47.925
You can place any bets you want.
It's just for fun.

17:48.086 --> 17:50.685
Mother, that's a good idea.

17:52.566 --> 17:55.085
Miss Cui, you're the guest.

17:55.086 --> 17:58.205
Please place your bet.

17:58.605 --> 17:59.646
Yes.

18:04.566 --> 18:06.245
Miss Cui, place the bet

18:06.246 --> 18:07.644
on the team you think they might win.

18:07.645 --> 18:09.565
Place the bet

18:09.566 --> 18:10.604
on the gold tray.

18:10.605 --> 18:11.884
Later, Miss Cui

18:11.885 --> 18:13.604
will toss the silk streamer
onto the stage

18:13.605 --> 18:15.126
to start the show.

18:16.766 --> 18:19.406
Lord Qi, which team
will you choose?

18:20.286 --> 18:21.404
I think

18:21.405 --> 18:23.364
the red team is agile.

18:23.365 --> 18:25.165
They are sure to win.

18:25.486 --> 18:26.485
If so, I place the bet

18:26.486 --> 18:28.165
on the team you choose.

18:32.486 --> 18:33.725
I bet on the red team.

18:33.885 --> 18:35.725
My bet is a golden bracelet.

18:38.526 --> 18:40.725
Lord Qin, do you want to place your bet?

18:41.885 --> 18:42.844
Your Highness.

18:42.845 --> 18:43.644
Please allow me

18:43.645 --> 18:45.525
to choose for you.

18:45.566 --> 18:46.806
Which team would you like to choose?

18:47.086 --> 18:48.565
I believe

18:48.566 --> 18:49.886
the blue team will win.

18:51.806 --> 18:52.606
All right.

18:52.726 --> 18:54.085
I'll bet on the blue team

18:54.086 --> 18:55.245
on Miss Gu's behalf.

18:57.526 --> 19:00.005
This jade pendant is my bet.

19:00.006 --> 19:01.965
You're generous, Ni.

19:02.405 --> 19:03.326
So generous.

19:31.685 --> 19:33.646
Miss Cui, please enjoy the show.

19:46.445 --> 19:47.286
Bravo.

19:49.645 --> 19:51.965
Fortunately, I didn't fail you
by my choice.

19:51.966 --> 19:53.445
Your Highness, you have sharp eyes.

19:56.006 --> 19:56.924
Giving the rest

19:56.925 --> 19:58.725
to the red team.

20:00.046 --> 20:01.404
Miss Cui, which team

20:01.405 --> 20:03.685
should we bet on in the next round?

20:04.326 --> 20:06.126
I think we should stick
with the red team.

20:06.365 --> 20:08.485
The red team will surely thrive

20:08.486 --> 20:09.965
on their success.

20:10.566 --> 20:11.644
Pass my order.

20:11.645 --> 20:13.364
All guests enjoyed the show today.

20:13.365 --> 20:14.765
Regardless of which team wins,

20:14.766 --> 20:16.245
reward them handsomely.

20:16.246 --> 20:17.245
Wait.

20:25.125 --> 20:27.566
This time, I'll participate in the show.

20:29.445 --> 20:30.245
Lai.

20:30.246 --> 20:31.844
You enjoy having fun.

20:31.845 --> 20:33.205
Do you care

20:33.246 --> 20:34.525
to compete with me?

20:34.845 --> 20:36.126
Um...

20:36.726 --> 20:37.844
Lord Qi.

20:37.845 --> 20:39.245
I'd like to

20:39.246 --> 20:40.404
be your partner

20:40.405 --> 20:41.685
for snatching the ball.

20:42.486 --> 20:43.684
With your help,

20:43.685 --> 20:44.965
we'll surely win the game.

20:45.405 --> 20:46.925
Ni.

20:47.046 --> 20:48.085
We have two people here,

20:48.086 --> 20:49.325
you're only alone.

20:49.326 --> 20:50.565
It's not fair for you.

20:50.566 --> 20:51.285
Why don't you

20:51.286 --> 20:52.485
pick one from the troupe

20:52.486 --> 20:54.364
to be your partner?

20:54.365 --> 20:55.204
No need.

20:55.205 --> 20:56.925
I can handle this.

20:59.766 --> 21:01.165
Lord Qin.

21:09.806 --> 21:11.085
If you don't despise

21:11.086 --> 21:12.604
my clumsiness,

21:12.605 --> 21:15.046
I'd like to be your partner.

21:15.405 --> 21:16.406
Miss Gu.

21:16.526 --> 21:19.326
The game is dangerous.

21:19.685 --> 21:21.005
Don't worry.

21:21.006 --> 21:22.326
I know.

21:25.685 --> 21:26.566
All right.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.366
If so, you'll go with me.

21:30.326 --> 21:32.205
Knowing you enjoy this so much,

21:32.645 --> 21:33.805
go to the treasury

21:33.806 --> 21:35.646
to bring a pair of dragon
and phoenix hairpins.

21:35.925 --> 21:37.765
I'd like to sweeten the pot.

21:38.006 --> 21:40.604
They'll be the prize for you.

21:40.605 --> 21:41.846
Thank you, Mother.

21:45.205 --> 21:46.965
We can run a pastry store.

21:46.966 --> 21:48.646
What do you say?

21:50.806 --> 21:52.204
I was just saying.

21:52.205 --> 21:53.805
You're taking it seriously?

21:53.806 --> 21:54.765
Of course.

21:54.766 --> 21:57.205
I take every word you say seriously.

22:00.766 --> 22:02.045
Actually,

22:02.046 --> 22:04.164
running a pastry store

22:04.165 --> 22:06.005
can be a good idea.

22:06.205 --> 22:07.285
Besides,

22:07.286 --> 22:08.884
I've noticed

22:08.885 --> 22:10.325
stores that sell trinkets

22:10.326 --> 22:12.165
are quite popular as well.

22:12.845 --> 22:15.164
Many misses and madams

22:15.165 --> 22:17.325
like to visit rouge stores too.

22:17.326 --> 22:18.165
Good.

22:18.326 --> 22:19.965
We'll open a store
to sell the things you like.

22:20.086 --> 22:21.366
Silly.

22:28.726 --> 22:30.566
The Empress holds a banquet today.

22:30.726 --> 22:31.765
How will

22:31.766 --> 22:33.765
it turn out?

22:33.925 --> 22:35.765
I wonder if Lord Qin and Young Lady

22:35.766 --> 22:37.245
will meet each other.

22:38.125 --> 22:39.406
They will.

22:40.326 --> 22:42.566
Mister Shiqi likes Miss Cui very much.

22:42.766 --> 22:43.644
He'll try his best

22:43.645 --> 22:44.725
to coax Miss Cui.

22:45.806 --> 22:48.085
Hopefully, they can make peace
with each other soon.

22:48.086 --> 22:49.325
Otherwise,

22:49.326 --> 22:51.124
I'll feel bad for them

22:51.125 --> 22:53.005
if they see us getting so close

22:53.006 --> 22:54.285
when they're in disputes.

22:54.286 --> 22:55.886
I feel sorry for Young Lady.

22:56.165 --> 22:57.165
They will reconcile.

24:59.925 --> 25:01.165
How could you do that?

25:09.925 --> 25:11.325
It seems you may have forgotten

25:11.326 --> 25:13.765
this is who I am.

25:18.326 --> 25:18.805
Bravo.

25:18.806 --> 25:20.646
Excellent.

25:21.445 --> 25:22.445
Great.

25:22.605 --> 25:23.765
Miss Cui.

25:23.766 --> 25:25.406
You're a heroine.

25:27.685 --> 25:29.525
Today, Miss Cui

25:29.526 --> 25:31.846
really blows my mind.

25:32.365 --> 25:33.565
Miss Cui,

25:33.566 --> 25:35.725
you're indeed a warrior
who fought on the battlefield.

25:35.806 --> 25:37.725
The show

25:37.726 --> 25:39.525
was epic.

25:46.246 --> 25:48.406
This is your reward, Miss Cui.

25:51.125 --> 25:52.846
Thank you, Your Majesty.

26:02.326 --> 26:03.765
This pair of dragon and phoenix hairpins

26:03.766 --> 26:05.325
is an art by great hands.

26:05.326 --> 26:06.806
They are exquisite.

26:07.205 --> 26:08.325
Your Majesty.

26:08.326 --> 26:10.164
May I have your permission

26:10.165 --> 26:12.126
to give the hairpins to someone else?

26:12.726 --> 26:15.085
This is your reward.

26:15.086 --> 26:17.046
You can handle it the way you want.

26:17.766 --> 26:18.886
Thank you.

26:26.685 --> 26:28.806
Thank you for being generous,
Your Highness.

26:28.885 --> 26:30.565
I'd like to present this hairpin

26:30.566 --> 26:32.086
to you

26:32.685 --> 26:34.165
as my token of gratitude.

26:49.365 --> 26:51.684
Lord Qi and Lord Qin

26:51.685 --> 26:53.005
are men,

26:53.006 --> 26:55.404
and I'm fighting on the battlefield.

26:55.405 --> 26:58.005
However, Miss Gu has always
been sheltered in the boudoir.

26:58.006 --> 27:00.525
But she bravely took the initiative
to join the game

27:00.566 --> 27:02.085
and didn't squeak

27:02.086 --> 27:03.685
when she got injured.

27:05.046 --> 27:06.445
Therefore, I'd like
to present this hairpin

27:09.405 --> 27:11.124
to Miss Gu

27:11.125 --> 27:13.165
as an appreciation
for your bravery today.

27:17.125 --> 27:18.685
Thank you, Miss Cui.

27:18.925 --> 27:20.364
I'm just giving you a gift

27:20.365 --> 27:22.406
that's prepared by Her Majesty.

27:24.006 --> 27:25.285
Lord Qin,

27:25.286 --> 27:27.085
both you and Miss Gu

27:27.086 --> 27:29.326
shall thank Her Majesty for her grace.

27:30.726 --> 27:32.005
Rightfully so.

27:36.046 --> 27:37.245
Thank you, Mother.

27:37.445 --> 27:39.205
Thank you, Your Majesty.

27:39.286 --> 27:40.725
You may rise.

27:40.726 --> 27:42.366
Please take a seat.

27:42.405 --> 27:43.406
Yes.

27:45.806 --> 27:48.646
Kind lady, come on here.

28:01.405 --> 28:02.326
Your Majesty.

28:06.445 --> 28:08.685
You have a delicate and pretty look,

28:08.726 --> 28:10.566
but you also exude the heroic spirit.

28:10.885 --> 28:12.606
The rarest thing is,

28:12.885 --> 28:15.005
you're generous and thoughtful.

28:15.845 --> 28:18.565
After knowing Gu Wan'niang's injury,

28:18.566 --> 28:19.884
I intended

28:19.885 --> 28:21.684
to give her a pair of pear earrings

28:21.685 --> 28:23.046
to comfort her.

28:23.445 --> 28:25.566
But you've already thought of that.

28:26.685 --> 28:28.606
Please don't blame me.

28:29.526 --> 28:31.046
I won't.

28:31.365 --> 28:33.005
Just now,

28:33.006 --> 28:34.325
you looked like

28:34.326 --> 28:38.566
a light and agile sparrow onstage.

28:39.046 --> 28:40.164
Lord Qin

28:40.165 --> 28:42.725
is regarded as a brave fighter.

28:43.006 --> 28:45.205
Yet, you won.

28:45.845 --> 28:47.005
Apparently,

28:47.006 --> 28:48.444
you're a cut

28:48.445 --> 28:49.925
above him.

28:50.246 --> 28:52.245
You're flattering me, Your Majesty.

28:53.326 --> 28:54.445
You must be hungry, right?

28:55.925 --> 28:57.165
Start the banquet.

28:57.246 --> 28:58.046
Yes.

28:58.445 --> 28:59.965
Please return to your seat.

29:00.246 --> 29:01.646
Thank you, Your Majesty.

29:29.845 --> 29:31.126
Miss Gu.

29:31.405 --> 29:33.126
Let me give you a toast.

29:43.766 --> 29:44.525
Lord Qi.

29:44.526 --> 29:45.765
Lord Qi.

29:58.526 --> 30:00.205
The water spreads far and wide.

30:00.966 --> 30:02.765
What a crisp autumn day today.

30:03.326 --> 30:05.765
Rafting on Taiye Pond

30:06.086 --> 30:08.086
above the shimmering water

30:08.526 --> 30:10.085
in the mid-autumn night

30:10.086 --> 30:12.925
will be a marvelous view to imagine.

30:14.486 --> 30:16.765
Indeed, it's marvelous.

30:16.925 --> 30:18.846
However, in the eyes of yours,

30:20.405 --> 30:22.204
beautiful sceneries

30:22.205 --> 30:24.164
can never be more interesting

30:24.165 --> 30:25.366
than your ambition.

30:31.125 --> 30:32.806
You resent me.

30:33.246 --> 30:35.165
Everyone has their own pursuit.
I can't resent you.

30:36.566 --> 30:38.566
But you look upset.

30:40.405 --> 30:41.444
I lost the game,

30:41.445 --> 30:43.046
so I'm not happy.

30:44.526 --> 30:45.604
I'm afraid

30:45.605 --> 30:47.646
you're not happy because you lost money,

30:47.726 --> 30:49.565
it's because I kissed you.

30:49.566 --> 30:50.485
Yes.

30:50.845 --> 30:53.165
How could you
do an inappropriate act like that?

30:53.365 --> 30:54.846
It'd be troublesome

30:55.046 --> 30:57.205
if people saw it.

31:01.326 --> 31:03.286
If so, will you tell others?

31:03.645 --> 31:05.126
It's not the behavior of a gentleman.

31:05.365 --> 31:07.046
Naturally, I won't.

31:10.806 --> 31:12.126
Thank you.

31:13.046 --> 31:14.525
I know

31:14.605 --> 31:16.765
you went to
the Ministry of Rites to look for

31:17.046 --> 31:18.765
the previous records

31:18.766 --> 31:20.765
and helped me to meet His Majesty

31:20.845 --> 31:22.366
in the court.

31:22.685 --> 31:24.085
No need to thank me.

31:24.086 --> 31:26.124
It's my duty to placate Great General Cui

31:26.125 --> 31:27.846
and share His Majesty's burden.

31:31.365 --> 31:32.085
Your Highness,

31:32.086 --> 31:33.684
looking at your decent actions,

31:33.685 --> 31:36.806
I really feel ashamed of myself.

31:41.246 --> 31:43.005
It's Li Lai. Let's leave.

31:47.806 --> 31:48.965
This is strange.

31:49.726 --> 31:51.005
The eunuch told me

31:51.006 --> 31:52.924
she came to the Taiye Pond.

31:52.925 --> 31:54.606
How come I see no sign of her?

32:20.405 --> 32:21.525
Miss Cui.

32:21.845 --> 32:22.846
Miss Cui.

32:23.885 --> 32:25.286
Lord Qi.

32:25.685 --> 32:26.965
I'm leaving the palace

32:26.966 --> 32:27.924
after the banquet.

32:27.925 --> 32:29.525
I can see you off.

32:30.006 --> 32:32.366
Thank you so much.

32:34.326 --> 32:35.565
You did excellent

32:35.566 --> 32:37.325
during the game just now.

32:37.326 --> 32:39.286
I'm very impressed by you.

32:39.486 --> 32:40.725
You flatter me.

32:40.726 --> 32:42.164
Those were just

32:42.165 --> 32:43.846
some cheap skills.

32:44.205 --> 32:45.844
If it wasn't for you,

32:45.845 --> 32:47.164
we wouldn't have won Lord Qin

32:47.165 --> 32:48.326
and claimed the reward.

32:48.885 --> 32:50.325
Because you have discerning eyes

32:50.326 --> 32:51.566
to bet it right.

33:03.806 --> 33:06.126
Isn't that Miss Cui?

33:07.966 --> 33:08.765
Your Highness.

33:16.165 --> 33:17.165
Miss Gu.

33:17.205 --> 33:18.406
Is your injury all right?

33:18.806 --> 33:20.124
I have a remedy that prevents scars

33:20.125 --> 33:21.245
in my residence.

33:21.246 --> 33:22.765
I'll have my men send it to you.

33:23.645 --> 33:24.765
Thank you, Your Highness.

33:24.966 --> 33:25.925
You're welcome.

33:26.445 --> 33:27.644
May I ask

33:27.645 --> 33:28.765
what's your hobby?

33:28.766 --> 33:30.045
Nanny likes

33:30.046 --> 33:31.565
the rose lychee plum pasty you gave.

33:31.566 --> 33:32.884
She wants me to thank you again.

33:32.885 --> 33:34.444
Since Nanny likes it,

33:34.445 --> 33:36.684
I shall invite her
to the store to taste it.

33:36.685 --> 33:38.684
It's said that riding horse
on Wonderland during autumn

33:38.685 --> 33:39.925
- is a great experience.
- Thank you.

33:40.365 --> 33:41.005
I believe tomorrow

33:41.006 --> 33:42.404
will be a good day.

33:42.405 --> 33:44.005
Why don't we

33:44.006 --> 33:45.366
visit Wonderland tomorrow?

33:46.165 --> 33:47.525
That's very kind of you.

33:47.605 --> 33:49.005
But

33:49.205 --> 33:51.580
I need to go to Ci'en Temple to thank
the deity for answering my prayer.

33:51.580 --> 33:52.886
I can go there with you.

33:53.526 --> 33:54.606
Your Highness.

33:55.645 --> 33:56.886
Your Highness.

33:58.726 --> 33:59.884
Lord Qi.

33:59.885 --> 34:01.086
His Majesty requests for you.

34:02.046 --> 34:03.085
It's a deal, then.

34:03.086 --> 34:04.600
I'll go to Ci'en Temple
with you tomorrow.

34:04.600 --> 34:05.846
I need to meet my father now.

34:10.046 --> 34:10.764
Don't forget.

34:10.765 --> 34:13.125
Tomorrow morning, I'll have my men
pick you up at your residence.

34:27.046 --> 34:28.324
Miss Cui

34:28.325 --> 34:30.125
is truly remarkable.

34:30.245 --> 34:32.806
She actually returned Luoyang
to the court.

34:33.325 --> 34:34.645
Indeed.

34:34.685 --> 34:38.045
Luoyang and Xichang
are near to each other.

34:38.526 --> 34:40.366
Given the current situation,

34:40.526 --> 34:43.605
if the Cui family continues
to occupy Luoyang,

34:44.086 --> 34:45.366
I'm afraid

34:45.526 --> 34:48.326
it'll only do more harm to them.

34:49.846 --> 34:50.684
Isn't this

34:50.685 --> 34:52.565
Great General Cui's idea?

34:53.366 --> 34:54.565
Probably,

34:54.846 --> 34:57.645
it's Cui Lin's.

34:57.725 --> 34:59.445
She went to the court meeting

34:59.446 --> 35:00.925
to return Luoyang.

35:01.205 --> 35:02.125
Hence,

35:02.245 --> 35:04.326
her marriage with a prince

35:04.685 --> 35:06.005
is going

35:07.366 --> 35:10.045
to be a done deal.

35:11.765 --> 35:13.445
Does Miss Cui

35:13.846 --> 35:15.686
want to be Crown Princess?

35:18.125 --> 35:20.246
Crown Princess?

35:23.846 --> 35:27.605
Everyone knows Crown Prince
sits in a difficult position,

35:28.406 --> 35:30.726
but no one has ever been concerned

35:31.125 --> 35:33.366
about Crown Princess.

35:34.366 --> 35:36.206
Even the most intelligent person

35:36.245 --> 35:38.085
has to restrain

35:38.886 --> 35:40.886
their glow

35:41.245 --> 35:43.005
when they finally
take over the Eastern Palace.

35:44.805 --> 35:46.366
Miss Cui

35:46.406 --> 35:48.166
is born straightforward by nature.

35:48.486 --> 35:49.284
Besides,

35:49.285 --> 35:51.005
she has a carefree soul.

35:51.805 --> 35:54.045
If she really becomes
the Crown Princess,

35:56.205 --> 35:58.125
it's a woe to her.

36:01.165 --> 36:02.326
Your Highness.

36:08.886 --> 36:10.085
Jin'niang.

36:11.846 --> 36:12.965
I brought you

36:12.966 --> 36:15.286
to the palace from my maiden family.

36:17.165 --> 36:19.965
I used to be a capricious person.

36:21.605 --> 36:23.645
However, since I married
into the Eastern Palace,

36:25.086 --> 36:27.645
my character has changed.

36:29.486 --> 36:31.366
As Crown Princess,

36:31.486 --> 36:33.686
I have to be virtuous and generous.

36:34.046 --> 36:35.886
In such desperate states

36:36.046 --> 36:37.806
where Crown Prince has died

36:38.006 --> 36:39.726
and the great imperial grandson
is in exile,

36:40.366 --> 36:42.766
I had to deal with Sun Jing

36:42.805 --> 36:44.925
to fight for a chance

36:46.125 --> 36:48.886
to restore the Dayu.

36:54.406 --> 36:56.045
I understand

36:58.926 --> 37:00.525
you're suffering inside.

37:05.165 --> 37:07.125
I'll tell Crown Prince everything

37:07.886 --> 37:10.406
when I'm six feet under.

37:11.566 --> 37:13.166
I did my best.

37:14.966 --> 37:17.565
I fulfilled my responsibility

37:17.725 --> 37:19.485
as Crown Princess.

37:21.526 --> 37:24.246
Even if I would be thrown into infamy,

37:25.566 --> 37:27.406
I wouldn't care.

37:34.645 --> 37:36.206
The thing is, Jin'niang,

37:38.725 --> 37:41.125
I can no longer recognize myself.

37:44.765 --> 37:46.724
When history mentions me,

37:46.725 --> 37:49.045
it'll only be a few short lines

37:50.285 --> 37:53.005
saying that I'm a disloyal woman.

37:54.406 --> 37:56.166
But I've done so much.

37:59.046 --> 38:00.124
I'm confused

38:00.125 --> 38:01.686
who I am now.

38:04.046 --> 38:05.085
Your Highness.

38:06.926 --> 38:08.406
You can cry.

38:08.926 --> 38:10.645
Have a good cry.

38:12.846 --> 38:13.686
No, I can't.

38:16.006 --> 38:18.246
Ever since I've become
the Crown Princess,

38:19.205 --> 38:21.005
I told myself

38:21.446 --> 38:23.605
not to be weak and not to cry.

38:27.566 --> 38:28.965
I mustn't forget

38:30.245 --> 38:33.045
that I was once
the Crown Princess of the Dayu.

38:45.165 --> 38:47.085
Last night, in the middle of the night,

38:47.086 --> 38:48.405
I heard Mister Shiqi

38:48.406 --> 38:49.845
was practicing with his sword again.

38:49.846 --> 38:51.885
I suppose he didn't sleep all night.

38:51.886 --> 38:53.124
It's normal that he can't sleep

38:53.125 --> 38:54.686
when he suffers from lovesickness.

38:55.165 --> 38:58.005
Isn't Miss Cui at Xichang?

38:58.006 --> 39:00.005
Yes, but so what?

39:00.006 --> 39:02.284
Then why must he suffer?

39:02.285 --> 39:03.244
You don't know.

39:03.245 --> 39:04.365
You do?

39:04.366 --> 39:05.565
Have you ever touched a woman's hand?

39:05.566 --> 39:07.604
Do you know better than I do?
Have you touched a woman's hand?

39:07.605 --> 39:08.684
- I did.
- Did you?

39:08.685 --> 39:09.804
- I know.
- I did.

39:09.805 --> 39:10.845
Fine. Enough.

39:10.846 --> 39:11.886
Eat the congee.

39:13.566 --> 39:14.485
Mister Shiqi.

39:14.526 --> 39:15.366
Mister Shiqi!

39:16.006 --> 39:17.726
Where are you going
early in the morning?

39:18.645 --> 39:20.085
I'm going for a walk.

39:20.086 --> 39:20.965
You said

39:20.966 --> 39:23.246
you wanted to give Miss Gu
the ointment yesterday.

39:23.285 --> 39:24.326
Who's sending it over?

39:24.446 --> 39:26.846
Are you sending it yourself?

39:27.325 --> 39:28.366
You go.

39:28.526 --> 39:30.525
Fine. I shouldn't have asked.

39:31.046 --> 39:32.045
Mister Shiqi.

39:32.165 --> 39:34.366
Don't you have anything
to give Miss Cui?

39:35.486 --> 39:36.286
No.

39:41.765 --> 39:43.604
Why does he send medicine to Miss Gu

39:43.605 --> 39:45.525
and not to Miss Cui?

39:45.846 --> 39:47.686
How am I supposed to know?

39:49.406 --> 39:51.605
- You don't know.
- You don't know.

39:54.886 --> 39:57.085
Come here and eat this.

39:57.973 --> 40:01.762
(Cui Residence)

40:12.406 --> 40:14.206
Greetings, Your Highness.

40:17.526 --> 40:18.684
Where's Miss Cui?

40:18.685 --> 40:19.885
We promised

40:19.886 --> 40:21.286
to visit Ci'en Temple.

40:22.846 --> 40:23.965
Miss Cui

40:23.966 --> 40:25.684
went out this morning.

40:25.685 --> 40:28.485
Last night, she lit incense and divined
for an auspicious hour to go out.

40:28.486 --> 40:31.565
The sign showed it should be
quarter to seven in the morning.

40:31.566 --> 40:32.604
Besides,

40:32.605 --> 40:34.124
she can't bring anyone with her

40:34.125 --> 40:36.244
to show sincerity.

40:36.245 --> 40:38.045
I wasn't allowed to tag along.

40:38.285 --> 40:39.804
However, Young Lady instructed me

40:39.805 --> 40:40.925
to wait here

40:40.926 --> 40:42.284
and relayed a message to you.

40:42.285 --> 40:44.724
She's very sorry

40:44.725 --> 40:46.485
to make you come here for nothing.

40:50.526 --> 40:51.365
Never mind.

40:51.366 --> 40:53.085
I'll meet her at Ci'en Temple.

40:54.645 --> 40:55.965
I bid you farewell, Your Highness.

41:13.285 --> 41:14.885
It seems simple.

41:14.886 --> 41:16.645
But I can't weave it properly.

41:33.486 --> 41:34.886
What brings you here?

41:36.805 --> 41:38.206
I was thinking

41:38.285 --> 41:39.246
of taking a stroll,

41:39.645 --> 41:40.925
but ended up here.

41:41.205 --> 41:43.846
I was just following my will.

41:45.366 --> 41:46.565
I didn't expect

41:46.846 --> 41:48.286
to see you here.

41:51.325 --> 41:53.565
I didn't want to go to Ci'en Temple.

41:55.366 --> 41:56.286
I know.

42:01.046 --> 42:02.605
Since we met here,

42:03.125 --> 42:04.366
Shiqi,

42:04.846 --> 42:09.366
can you accompany me today?

42:10.566 --> 42:11.846
Just today,

42:12.205 --> 42:13.965
you're not Lord Qin,

42:14.125 --> 42:16.166
and I'm not Miss Cui.

42:16.645 --> 42:18.246
Let's stay together

42:18.966 --> 42:20.846
carefreely and happily for one day.

42:21.285 --> 42:22.286
All right?

42:26.846 --> 42:29.406
All right.

42:48.765 --> 42:50.166
Do you remember

42:50.285 --> 42:51.965
you promised me

42:52.205 --> 42:54.045
that if one day

42:54.325 --> 42:55.886
the world nestles in peace,

42:56.006 --> 42:57.644
we would

42:57.645 --> 42:59.326
ride on horses
across the plains of Wonderland?

42:59.446 --> 43:00.525
Ying.

43:00.926 --> 43:02.605
Once the country nestles in peace,

43:02.805 --> 43:04.324
let's go

43:04.325 --> 43:06.005
and have fun in Wonderland?

43:06.566 --> 43:07.846
Deal.

43:12.846 --> 43:14.324
For whatever we said

43:14.325 --> 43:15.965
and promises we made,

43:16.526 --> 43:18.485
perhaps none will come true,

43:20.725 --> 43:21.525
but I really hope

43:21.526 --> 43:23.125
that this day will come,

43:23.205 --> 43:25.326
even if it's only 24 hours.

43:25.725 --> 43:28.525
We leave everything behind

43:28.805 --> 43:30.324
and spend a happy

43:30.325 --> 43:32.445
and carefree day together.

you could meet me earlier.

If I could meet you earlier,

of the days in Laolan Pass.

Every autumn,

45:31.852 --> 45:33.731
Bao would go to hunt Mongolian gazelle
by the riverside.

45:33.732 --> 45:35.853
We ate roasted mutton every day.

45:36.493 --> 45:38.492
You're making me hungry.

45:41.332 --> 45:43.733
I can go down to catch fish.

45:44.093 --> 45:45.052
Sure.

45:45.852 --> 45:46.651
Shiqi.

45:46.652 --> 45:47.651
Over there.

45:47.652 --> 45:49.012
There's a big fish.

45:49.973 --> 45:51.132
Yes, over there.

45:54.332 --> 45:55.213
Catch this.

a good writer

finally caught a fish

46:09.172 --> 46:10.532
after great efforts

46:10.533 --> 46:12.532
but didn't deliver the fish properly
to my hands.

I'm not complimenting you.
