=Episode 11=

02:10.761 --> 02:12.481
Cui Li, why are you blocking me?

02:12.880 --> 02:14.120
Collaborating with the enemy,

02:14.120 --> 02:15.521
collaborating with the Zhenxi Army.

02:16.081 --> 02:16.784
Why?

02:17.120 --> 02:18.280
Are you not going to confess?

02:18.820 --> 02:19.820
Do you have any evidence?

02:21.880 --> 02:24.201
This is a secret letter from Li Ni

02:24.280 --> 02:25.680
of the Zhenxi Army wrote to you.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.921
You gave the Zhenxi Army

02:28.000 --> 02:30.201
every detail of the situation
of the besieged Yingzhou.

02:30.720 --> 02:33.201
The letter is crystal clear.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.400
How did you get your hands
on this letter?

02:37.000 --> 02:37.641
Why?

02:38.640 --> 02:39.740
You're finally admitting it now.

02:40.600 --> 02:42.041
It's rock-solid evidence.

02:42.440 --> 02:43.641
If it weren't for you,

02:44.160 --> 02:44.880
we didn't have to

02:45.000 --> 02:47.120
hand over Luoyang City
to the Zhenxi Army.

02:47.680 --> 02:48.321
Arrest her!

02:49.361 --> 02:50.000
Stop it!

02:57.560 --> 02:59.321
Shiqi, you're finally back.

02:59.720 --> 03:00.560
Did anything happen?

03:00.560 --> 03:01.800
We received an urgent military report.

03:01.801 --> 03:03.120
Li Jun and Li Lai and their troops

03:03.120 --> 03:04.720
are closing into Luoshui.

03:07.201 --> 03:07.921
It looks like

03:08.340 --> 03:09.720
Sun Jing has long withdrawn his men

03:09.840 --> 03:11.560
from besieging my brothers.

03:12.801 --> 03:14.120
Those two brothers of mine

03:14.921 --> 03:16.361
sure don't disappoint me.

03:30.400 --> 03:31.321
What are you doing?

03:32.000 --> 03:33.600
Lin, you're here just in time.

03:34.120 --> 03:35.081
I've long suspected

03:35.120 --> 03:37.840
that Lieutenant He has been contacting Li Ni
from the Zhenxi Army in secret.

03:38.321 --> 03:39.000
It was she

03:39.120 --> 03:40.720
who leaked many of our military secrets.

03:41.280 --> 03:42.160
This is the evidence.

03:45.321 --> 03:47.000
It was Lieutenant He

03:47.120 --> 03:49.440
who leaked the news
about Yingzhou being besieged.

03:49.560 --> 03:50.560
It was the reason

03:50.641 --> 03:52.560
we had to surrender Luoyang City.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.720
If Lieutenant He doesn't die,

03:54.720 --> 03:55.801
how can we face the soldiers

03:55.921 --> 03:58.160
who have fought valiantly
on the battlefield?

04:01.120 --> 04:01.720
Lin,

04:02.041 --> 04:03.280
I know you have a soft heart.

04:04.241 --> 04:05.000
So,

04:05.241 --> 04:06.321
let me handle this for you.

04:06.820 --> 04:07.950
So, you don't have to worry.

04:08.761 --> 04:09.481
Guards!

04:10.440 --> 04:11.081
Stop it!

04:15.641 --> 04:16.441
Cui Li,

04:17.400 --> 04:19.800
Taozi wrote this letter.

04:20.320 --> 04:22.110
Young Master is aware
of this matter as well.

04:23.160 --> 04:25.121
Recently, Lieutenant He noticed
unusual activity

04:25.600 --> 04:26.800
within the army.

04:27.480 --> 04:29.240
After she reported this to me,

04:29.561 --> 04:31.840
she deliberately wrote this letter as bait

04:34.160 --> 04:35.641
to see

04:36.561 --> 04:37.720
who would fall for it.

04:41.400 --> 04:43.400
You set me up.

04:44.081 --> 04:45.480
The letter is in my camp.

04:45.761 --> 04:47.240
If you didn't send someone to steal it

04:47.260 --> 04:48.540
because of your malicious intent,

04:48.620 --> 04:50.321
how would it have ended up
in your hands?

04:55.040 --> 04:56.121
Lin, I...

04:56.280 --> 04:57.561
I did this

04:57.681 --> 04:59.360
because she's behaving
very suspiciously.

04:59.881 --> 05:01.360
I only wanted to assist you.

05:01.561 --> 05:02.759
You have to believe me.

05:02.760 --> 05:03.540
I was only trying to...

05:03.561 --> 05:04.280
Father trained

05:04.400 --> 05:05.561
the Cui Army.

05:05.920 --> 05:07.521
Our soldiers are united

05:08.001 --> 05:09.321
and follow a strict military code.

05:10.081 --> 05:11.840
We've never had any internal conflicts

05:12.040 --> 05:13.400
or power struggles.

05:13.800 --> 05:16.160
Cui Li, since you arrived,

05:16.641 --> 05:18.641
you've repeatedly tried
to frame your comrades!

05:18.961 --> 05:19.881
Do you think

05:20.001 --> 05:21.600
I didn't notice

05:22.800 --> 05:24.521
your little schemes and ideas?

05:26.441 --> 05:27.521
When one frames his comrade,

05:27.761 --> 05:30.040
what is the punishment
according to the Cui Army's regulations?

05:30.160 --> 05:32.881
Those who frame comrades
will be stripped of their military power

05:33.561 --> 05:35.160
and receive thirty strokes.

05:37.761 --> 05:39.600
Cui Li, your five thousand soldiers

05:39.720 --> 05:41.280
will be temporarily commanded by Shu.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.160
Since this is your first offense,

05:43.881 --> 05:45.480
we'll skip the rod punishment.

05:49.480 --> 05:50.040
Lin...

05:50.160 --> 05:50.881
Go!

05:56.180 --> 05:59.110
This time, we managed to take the opportunity
to reclaim Cui Li's military power.

05:59.240 --> 06:00.201
I believe

06:00.521 --> 06:02.280
he can't stir up any trouble now.

06:07.561 --> 06:08.121
Young Master,

06:10.200 --> 06:10.920
are you all right?

06:11.020 --> 06:13.600
Did you catch a cold
from staying outside too long?

06:13.720 --> 06:14.521
I'll have Taozi come

06:14.641 --> 06:15.800
and check your pulse.

06:18.040 --> 06:18.840
Ying,

06:19.840 --> 06:20.920
where did you go

06:21.961 --> 06:23.441
when you left the camp today?

06:28.001 --> 06:29.280
I went to see Li Ni.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.280
Li Ni is the commander
of the Zhenxi Army!

06:32.441 --> 06:35.040
You shouldn't have gone
and met him privately multiple times!

06:37.761 --> 06:38.521
I know

06:39.201 --> 06:41.121
you don't want to hear me
say this right now.

06:41.761 --> 06:42.600
But

06:42.681 --> 06:43.920
as you saw today,

06:44.360 --> 06:45.800
we set up a trap,

06:45.800 --> 06:47.210
waiting to lure the snake
out of its hole.

06:47.441 --> 06:48.681
You went out on your own

06:48.740 --> 06:50.441
and gave Cui Li a chance
to intercept you.

06:50.881 --> 06:52.521
What if he had really attacked you?

06:53.140 --> 06:54.081
Don't worry, Young Master.

06:54.400 --> 06:55.400
A mere Cui Li

06:55.561 --> 06:56.641
can't do anything to me.

07:01.761 --> 07:02.681
Ying,

07:03.840 --> 07:05.561
I know you're confident and prepared.

07:06.201 --> 07:07.840
But things are unpredictable in a fight.

07:08.280 --> 07:09.720
If you had gotten hurt for real,

07:10.360 --> 07:11.920
how could I feel at ease?

07:19.360 --> 07:20.280
Young Master, here.

07:20.600 --> 07:21.561
Have some tea.

07:22.121 --> 07:22.840
Drink it.

07:31.820 --> 07:32.760
Are you feeling better?

07:34.961 --> 07:35.600
Ying,

07:38.180 --> 07:39.040
do you know something?

07:40.600 --> 07:43.720
You mean more to me

07:44.881 --> 07:46.280
than anything else.

07:49.321 --> 07:50.121
Even...

07:52.240 --> 07:54.360
Even more than myself.

08:02.761 --> 08:04.441
We grew up together.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.840
I've always regarded you
as an older brother.

08:09.201 --> 08:11.840
So, you're also important

08:13.001 --> 08:14.160
to me.

08:21.121 --> 08:21.761
Yes,

08:24.240 --> 08:25.840
we share a sibling-like bond.

08:27.881 --> 08:29.121
Saying these

08:30.681 --> 08:31.321
unexpectedly...

08:33.120 --> 08:34.520
Unexpectedly makes us feel distant.

08:38.681 --> 08:39.760
The physician has instructed

08:40.000 --> 08:41.321
that you need a quiet rest.

08:42.120 --> 08:43.321
So, I won't bother you anymore.

08:43.880 --> 08:45.161
Get some rest.

08:47.840 --> 08:48.281
All right.

09:17.720 --> 09:18.561
At the latest, tomorrow,

09:19.201 --> 09:21.720
Li Jun and Li Lai will lead their troops
to arrive in Luoyang.

09:22.041 --> 09:23.321
Those two

09:23.480 --> 09:24.600
have always been jealous

09:24.720 --> 09:26.201
of your military achievements.

09:26.360 --> 09:27.240
They must have come

09:27.401 --> 09:28.561
with ill intentions this time.

09:28.961 --> 09:30.840
Shiqi, make up a plan.

09:33.441 --> 09:35.000
Since my brothers have come,

09:35.801 --> 09:36.760
we should leave

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
and give up Luoyang City

09:38.161 --> 09:39.120
to them.

09:39.480 --> 09:41.000
Give up Luoyang City to them?

09:41.240 --> 09:42.240
We fought hard

09:42.360 --> 09:43.281
to take Luoyang.

09:43.320 --> 09:44.380
And we even gave up three cities

09:44.380 --> 09:46.180
in exchange for the withdrawal
of the Cui Army from Luoyang.

09:46.180 --> 09:47.401
Now, do we just hand it over to them?

09:47.620 --> 09:49.110
It's the same
if my brothers are stationed

09:49.120 --> 09:50.041
in Luoyang City.

09:50.320 --> 09:51.740
Quick and decisive action
is essential.

09:52.401 --> 09:53.480
We'll head to Tong Pass.

09:53.921 --> 09:55.240
How can it be the same?

10:04.095 --> 10:06.196
(Tong Pass)

10:12.921 --> 10:13.720
I get it now.

10:14.401 --> 10:17.319
Tong Pass is strategically located
with the Wei River to the north,

10:17.320 --> 10:18.199
Mount Qinling to the south,

10:18.200 --> 10:20.110
Central Plains to the east,
and Guanzhong plain to the west.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.080
Plus, it controls the post road
between Xichang and Luoyang.

10:22.081 --> 10:23.420
It's highly contested military ground.

10:23.520 --> 10:24.801
Sun Jing won't expect us

10:24.921 --> 10:25.961
to abandon Luoyang.

10:26.081 --> 10:27.321
This will catch him off guard.

10:28.921 --> 10:30.000
Once we occupy Tong Pass,

10:30.120 --> 10:32.360
it's like holding Xichang at its throat.

10:32.520 --> 10:33.961
Then, we'll be close

10:34.441 --> 10:35.401
to capturing Xichang.

10:36.640 --> 10:37.681
That would be the best.

10:38.281 --> 10:39.840
As long as we hold Tong Pass,

10:39.840 --> 10:42.060
those brothers of yours
won't have anywhere to advance

10:42.161 --> 10:44.561
or to retreat even if they want
to take any action.

10:45.880 --> 10:46.520
Shiqi,

10:46.720 --> 10:47.720
I thought

10:47.840 --> 10:48.840
you would go soft

10:49.000 --> 10:49.961
on those two.

10:50.120 --> 10:51.161
It's good

10:51.321 --> 10:52.441
to see you're not.

10:54.880 --> 10:57.041
I'm just looking out
for my two older brothers.

10:57.720 --> 10:59.020
They tend to be overly ambitious

10:59.240 --> 11:00.520
and easily get carried away.

11:01.081 --> 11:04.120
It's better to let them stay in Luoyang City.

11:04.720 --> 11:06.600
Lest they fall into any traps,

11:07.020 --> 11:09.040
and I have to go through great trouble
to rescue them.

11:29.610 --> 11:30.120
Young Master.

11:30.420 --> 11:31.420
Young Master, you're awake.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.041
Where's Lieutenant He?

11:36.201 --> 11:37.840
She stayed in her tent all night

11:37.961 --> 11:38.801
and didn't go out.

11:44.720 --> 11:45.360
Young Master,

11:45.600 --> 11:46.921
the physician has checked on you.

11:47.480 --> 11:49.201
He said you fainted twice.

11:49.480 --> 11:50.480
You must worry less,

11:50.640 --> 11:51.640
and focus on your recovery.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.921
I know you're worried about Lieutenant He.

12:00.240 --> 12:01.559
But sooner or later,

12:01.560 --> 12:04.000
she'll know you're the nicest person
to her in the world, Young Master.

12:06.360 --> 12:07.801
She's so intelligent.

12:09.041 --> 12:10.360
Of course, she could feel

12:13.081 --> 12:14.880
how well I treated her.

12:15.961 --> 12:17.720
Then, you should feel at ease even more.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.319
Lieutenant He isn't an ungrateful person.

12:20.320 --> 12:22.220
Yesterday, you went to her rescue
despite being ill.

12:22.441 --> 12:23.281
Seeing that,

12:23.620 --> 12:24.760
she'll definitely feel moved.

12:26.961 --> 12:28.801
But what I want from her

12:31.281 --> 12:33.161
is never her gratitude

12:33.681 --> 12:34.600
or repayment.

12:38.561 --> 12:41.120
Master, stop drinking.

12:41.961 --> 12:43.201
You haven't slept all night.

12:43.321 --> 12:45.081
It's harmful to your health.

12:48.360 --> 12:49.961
Cui Lin, you cunning fox.

12:50.480 --> 12:54.000
You teamed up with Lieutenant He to trick me

12:54.640 --> 12:56.760
and forced me
to hand over my military authority!

12:59.760 --> 13:01.041
It seems

13:01.441 --> 13:03.600
they're already suspicious of me now.

13:05.760 --> 13:07.720
It won't be easy to act

13:09.041 --> 13:10.480
in the future.

13:11.681 --> 13:14.120
Master, we just received
a secret report.

13:14.281 --> 13:16.760
The Zhenxi Army sent a letter
to Lieutenant He again.

13:18.480 --> 13:19.801
Does Cui Lin know about this?

13:19.820 --> 13:22.260
The secret letter was delivered directly
to Lieutenant He's tent.

13:22.321 --> 13:23.921
The main camp is unaware of it.

13:24.321 --> 13:25.201
So,

13:25.681 --> 13:27.640
should we send someone to investigate?

13:28.520 --> 13:30.120
After what happened yesterday,

13:30.561 --> 13:32.520
Lieutenant He may lower their guard.

13:32.640 --> 13:34.120
We may never know

13:34.240 --> 13:35.240
if we find something.

13:37.401 --> 13:39.401
As long as Cui Lin is here,

13:39.921 --> 13:41.480
it won't be easy

13:41.600 --> 13:43.041
to take action against Lieutenant He.

13:44.921 --> 13:46.480
But if we can discover

13:46.681 --> 13:47.640
any information,

13:47.921 --> 13:50.081
it would be to our advantage.

13:52.480 --> 13:53.041
So

13:54.360 --> 13:55.840
order someone to investigate

13:56.000 --> 13:57.240
the content of the secret letter.

13:58.840 --> 14:02.161
Don't leave any trace.

14:03.041 --> 14:04.321
(During my spare time,)

14:04.600 --> 14:06.520
(I often admire personal artwork.)

14:06.540 --> 14:08.300
(I'm currently creating
artwork diligently.)

14:09.120 --> 14:11.260
(Is it possible for me to ask
for a beautiful portrait of you,)

14:11.441 --> 14:14.161
(so I won't feel lonely?)

14:20.000 --> 14:20.760
Lieutenant He,

14:20.820 --> 14:22.300
aren't you going to reply to the letter?

14:24.120 --> 14:25.441
Why are you rushing?

14:26.520 --> 14:28.961
No, I'm not rushing.

14:29.120 --> 14:30.760
The letter isn't for me.

14:32.720 --> 14:33.640
Since you're not in a rush,

14:33.840 --> 14:35.520
so I'll handle
some official documents first.

14:35.620 --> 14:36.810
You can go back and get some rest.

14:36.820 --> 14:37.920
You don't have to keep me company.

14:39.120 --> 14:40.441
I'm not in a hurry.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.441
But Xie Chang'er
who delivered the letter

14:42.600 --> 14:43.681
is in a rush.

14:45.120 --> 14:46.401
It's such a hot day.

14:46.520 --> 14:47.921
He probably has gone back already.

14:50.360 --> 14:51.360
You don't know

14:51.720 --> 14:53.561
how stubborn that person is.

14:53.620 --> 14:55.870
If you don't notify him
that you're not replying to the letter,

14:55.880 --> 14:57.561
he'll definitely still
be waiting outside.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.681
Lieutenant He,

15:03.441 --> 15:04.921
I'll go and inform him, then.

15:06.401 --> 15:07.520
I'm going now.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.240
I'm going for real.

15:09.341 --> 15:09.860
I...

15:09.880 --> 15:10.600
Wait.

15:11.880 --> 15:13.640
Since you're in a rush,

15:13.820 --> 15:15.320
I'll just write one
to reply to his letter.

15:15.720 --> 15:17.480
Lest our little Miss Taozi

15:17.600 --> 15:18.921
made a trip for nothing.

15:19.961 --> 15:20.360
All right.

15:20.760 --> 15:21.600
I'll wait for you.

15:25.401 --> 15:27.081
Lieutenant He, the scout reported

15:27.160 --> 15:28.820
that the Zhenxi Army had withdrawn
from Luoyang.

15:28.820 --> 15:30.401
Lord Liang's eldest son,
Lord Linzi, Li Jun,

15:30.420 --> 15:31.420
has led his troop into the city.

15:31.520 --> 15:32.321
By tonight,

15:32.420 --> 15:34.321
Lord Liang's second son,
Lord Kuaiji, Li Lai,

15:34.420 --> 15:35.600
will also arrive with his troops.

15:38.840 --> 15:39.441
All right.

15:43.081 --> 15:44.360
I didn't expect

15:44.420 --> 15:45.840
Imperial Grandson
to be so accommodating

15:46.000 --> 15:47.159
to his two older brothers.

15:47.160 --> 15:48.410
He agrees to whatever they want.

15:49.161 --> 15:49.961
But Lieutenant He,

15:50.321 --> 15:51.921
where will he go

15:52.201 --> 15:53.110
after leaving Luoyang?

15:53.420 --> 15:54.681
Did he mention it in his letter?

15:55.360 --> 15:57.921
Of course, he won't mention it
in the letter.

15:59.201 --> 16:01.041
If he didn't mention it in the letter,

16:01.161 --> 16:02.441
what do you all write about then?

16:05.801 --> 16:07.561
Only some trivial matters.

16:07.588 --> 16:09.948
(Please draw it yourself.)

16:22.000 --> 16:22.681
Hello, Miss Taozi.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.880
A letter our Lieutenant to His Highness.

16:26.860 --> 16:27.720
Thank you, Miss Taozi.

16:27.880 --> 16:28.720
I'll get going, then.

16:30.920 --> 16:32.020
Are you leaving just like that?

16:34.081 --> 16:35.000
Is there anything else?

16:40.041 --> 16:40.600
What's this?

16:42.240 --> 16:45.281
This is a special healing ointment
I personally formulated.

16:45.720 --> 16:47.120
You can't buy it outside.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.041
I thought,

16:49.201 --> 16:50.681
with all your military activities,

16:50.961 --> 16:51.520
there might be

16:51.681 --> 16:52.760
some bumps and bruises.

16:53.240 --> 16:54.520
If you use this,

16:55.120 --> 16:56.201
you'll recover quickly.

16:57.081 --> 16:58.360
Thank you, Miss Taozi.

16:58.740 --> 16:59.570
You're a nice person.

17:00.720 --> 17:01.720
Stop talking nonsense.

17:02.420 --> 17:03.201
I'll get going then.

17:04.601 --> 17:05.361
Thank you!

17:07.961 --> 17:08.841
What a fool.

17:22.920 --> 17:24.590
(Last night,
I stayed in the countryside.)

17:25.401 --> 17:27.240
(The moon was as clean
as if it was washed.)

17:27.520 --> 17:29.540
(I felt like I could pluck the stars
from the sky.)

17:30.920 --> 17:32.401
(A few days ago,
I visited Zhuque Lane in Dongdu)

17:32.401 --> 17:33.400
(and bought some dried fruits.)

17:33.441 --> 17:34.601
(They tasted delicious.)

17:34.720 --> 17:36.300
(They broke like fine jade
as I chewed them)

17:36.310 --> 17:37.910
(and enjoyed chewing them
through the long night.)

17:37.920 --> 17:39.480
(I hope to share
this experience with you.)

17:43.537 --> 17:45.170
♪A fated relationship♪

17:46.545 --> 17:49.076
♪Yet, playing roles that shouldn't be♪

17:50.161 --> 17:51.910
(I found combining dried nuts
with preserved fruits)

17:52.040 --> 17:53.441
(enhances the flavor.)

17:53.641 --> 17:57.161
(People in the past
enjoyed them separately.)

17:57.161 --> 17:59.441
(But trying them together now,)

17:59.480 --> 18:01.201
(the taste is intriguing.)

18:01.215 --> 18:03.037
♪Cut off resentment and hatred♪

18:03.732 --> 18:05.357
♪This colorful array across the sky♪

18:05.842 --> 18:09.631
♪Belongs only to you and me♪

18:12.818 --> 18:18.631
♪You're the dawn of anticipation,
hearts aglow♪

18:19.263 --> 18:25.412
♪You're the final answer,

18:27.263 --> 18:32.357
♪My unspoken words

18:33.263 --> 18:35.787
♪One after another♪

18:38.100 --> 18:40.010
(The horse leaped over the stream
this morning.)

18:40.641 --> 18:41.760
(Upon smelling the fragrance)

18:42.100 --> 18:43.410
(and coming across
a wild cinnamon tree.)

18:45.205 --> 18:46.600
(With its hidden aroma drifting
in the air,)

18:46.841 --> 18:49.841
(I enjoyed this sight myself
with deep regret.)

18:50.620 --> 18:52.040
(Then, I picked several flower buds)

18:52.560 --> 18:54.240
(to create a fragrant sachet,)

18:54.841 --> 18:57.841
(hoping we could enjoy it together
another day.)

18:57.865 --> 19:00.263
♪I'm willing to abandon
this world for you♪

19:01.120 --> 19:05.365
♪No regrets in this lifetime♪

19:20.760 --> 19:21.401
Lieutenant He!

19:26.881 --> 19:29.161
Lieutenant He, I've been looking for you.

19:29.320 --> 19:30.201
So here you are.

19:30.520 --> 19:31.240
What's the matter?

19:33.800 --> 19:34.560
Nothing.

19:34.760 --> 19:36.121
I just want to ask

19:36.620 --> 19:38.040
if you're replying to his letter today.

19:38.520 --> 19:39.810
Are you worried that Xie Chang'er

19:39.961 --> 19:40.881
is in a rush again?

19:41.520 --> 19:42.641
No.

19:43.121 --> 19:44.480
I made an appointment with him

19:44.641 --> 19:45.921
that Luoyang would be our meeting point

19:46.040 --> 19:47.601
to exchange letters.

19:49.280 --> 19:50.601
Luoyang as the meeting point?

19:52.641 --> 19:53.720
Was it your idea

19:53.881 --> 19:55.240
or Xie Chang'er's idea?

19:55.881 --> 19:57.121
Xie Chang'er said,

19:57.280 --> 19:58.841
it was Mister Shiqi who suggested

19:59.161 --> 20:00.280
meeting in Luoyang

20:00.441 --> 20:01.641
to make it easier to find each other

20:01.800 --> 20:02.961
while marching.

20:03.401 --> 20:04.560
Xie Chang'er is the one

20:04.760 --> 20:06.361
who delivers messages
between the two armies.

20:06.681 --> 20:08.560
By keeping track of when he arrives

20:09.080 --> 20:09.681
and calculating

20:09.841 --> 20:11.240
the speed of the horses,

20:11.441 --> 20:12.720
it's quite easy to figure out

20:12.841 --> 20:15.560
where the Zhenxi Army
is currently heading.

20:18.841 --> 20:19.201
What?

20:19.361 --> 20:21.280
Li Ni is so cunning.

20:21.961 --> 20:24.000
Lieutenant He, only you

20:24.441 --> 20:25.480
could guess

20:25.480 --> 20:27.320
all his intricate thoughts
and intentions.

20:27.520 --> 20:28.601
Does that mean

20:28.760 --> 20:29.841
I'm cunning too?

20:30.121 --> 20:30.961
No,

20:31.121 --> 20:32.121
yours is wisdom.

20:34.280 --> 20:36.161
So are you going to reply to his letter?

20:39.601 --> 20:40.401
I don't know yet.

20:43.080 --> 20:44.520
What do you mean you don't know?

20:44.620 --> 20:45.780
Are you going to reply to him?

20:45.780 --> 20:46.740
Well, I really don't know.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.000
Well, will you write it?

20:48.020 --> 20:48.740
Come on, write it.

20:51.340 --> 20:52.420
Someone went inside your tent.

20:54.681 --> 20:55.921
Taozi, come.

20:56.320 --> 20:57.361
Let's take a walk.

20:58.000 --> 20:58.681
Lieutenant He,

20:58.820 --> 21:00.810
are we not going in
to catch that spy red-handed?

21:00.961 --> 21:01.480
No matter.

21:01.770 --> 21:03.110
Communicating with Li Ni using letters

21:03.280 --> 21:05.401
was meant to lure out this spy.

21:06.280 --> 21:08.921
Since they fell for it
and acted foolish again,

21:09.201 --> 21:10.161
then let them be.

21:12.881 --> 21:13.641
Master,

21:15.161 --> 21:17.161
this is the letter Li Ni wrote
to Lieutenant He.

21:17.280 --> 21:18.520
I thought of a way

21:18.681 --> 21:20.800
and copied it word by word.

21:23.681 --> 21:26.961
"I found combining dried nuts
with preserved fruits

21:26.961 --> 21:29.441
enhances the flavor?

21:29.841 --> 21:33.361
But trying them together now..."

21:36.000 --> 21:36.841
What's this?

21:37.280 --> 21:38.641
In my opinion,

21:39.201 --> 21:40.441
Li Ni and Lieutenant He

21:40.601 --> 21:42.121
are both shrewd individuals.

21:42.520 --> 21:44.520
This letter appears normal
on the surface.

21:44.681 --> 21:45.841
But it contains secret codes

21:46.000 --> 21:47.641
with hidden messages.

21:48.080 --> 21:48.980
That's why Lieutenant He

21:48.980 --> 21:50.560
didn't hide the letter
in some hidden place.

21:50.570 --> 21:51.710
She just left it out in the open

21:51.720 --> 21:53.110
without being afraid of it being seen.

21:53.220 --> 21:55.520
The phrase about combining dried nuts
and preserved fruits together

21:55.760 --> 21:57.760
must be their secret code.

22:00.280 --> 22:01.121
That makes sense.

22:02.121 --> 22:04.480
How about we get someone

22:04.641 --> 22:05.841
to decipher this letter?

22:06.601 --> 22:07.520
Of course.

22:08.921 --> 22:09.841
(Since our parting,)

22:10.760 --> 22:13.480
(just a few days have passed,
yet it feels like years.)

22:14.961 --> 22:16.601
(I have never felt like this before.)

22:17.441 --> 22:19.040
(How I miss you so.)

22:29.961 --> 22:33.320
(At sunset, I saw some plump
common water frogs.)

22:33.720 --> 22:36.401
(I caught a few of them
and roasted them.)

22:37.000 --> 22:38.480
(Too bad the fire was too intense,)

22:38.800 --> 22:40.280
(and they got slightly burnt.)

22:46.150 --> 22:48.377
(Letters)

23:02.201 --> 23:03.601
Master!

23:04.080 --> 23:05.480
After a lot of effort,

23:05.500 --> 23:07.980
we've finally figured out
the secret behind the communication

23:07.980 --> 23:09.220
between Lieutenant He and Li Ni.

23:09.641 --> 23:10.161
Go on.

23:10.881 --> 23:13.201
Upon leaving Laolan Pass,
Li Ni, Imperial Grandson,

23:13.401 --> 23:15.359
has always excelled
in long-distance raids,

23:15.359 --> 23:16.941
using deception
and diversion to create chaos.

23:16.941 --> 23:17.520
This time,

23:17.800 --> 23:19.401
he left Luoyang voluntarily.

23:19.601 --> 23:21.441
I'm sure he's using the same tactic.

23:22.161 --> 23:23.121
You have a point.

23:23.520 --> 23:24.280
Keep going.

23:25.120 --> 23:26.320
Master Cui, please take a look.

23:26.480 --> 23:29.280
This letter is the most recent letter
that Lieutenant He received.

23:29.841 --> 23:31.040
The phrase "caught a few"

23:31.320 --> 23:32.201
typically refers

23:32.720 --> 23:35.401
to a target staying by the lakeside.

23:35.560 --> 23:36.720
By breaking down the phrase,

23:36.881 --> 23:39.000
doesn't it suggest
an encircling strategy?

23:40.641 --> 23:42.681
Then who's the target by the lakeside?

23:43.000 --> 23:44.040
Now, isn't it a coincidence

23:44.240 --> 23:46.161
that our army happened
to have passed by a lake

23:46.320 --> 23:48.240
and is now located by the lakeside?

23:48.921 --> 23:50.201
If nothing goes wrong,

23:50.361 --> 23:51.560
at sunset today,

23:51.660 --> 23:54.161
the Zhenxi Army will likely send someone
to join Lieutenant He,

23:54.361 --> 23:56.121
coordinating an ambush
against our forces.

23:56.280 --> 23:56.881
Master,

23:57.480 --> 24:00.921
why not inform
the commander of this now?

24:01.121 --> 24:02.961
Then, we could set an ambush.

24:03.121 --> 24:04.480
If we successfully repel
the Zhenxi Army,

24:04.601 --> 24:06.560
it would be a significant achievement.

24:07.800 --> 24:08.361
Indeed.

24:10.841 --> 24:12.121
You fools!

24:12.881 --> 24:13.601
Master, calm down.

24:13.800 --> 24:14.560
Answer me.

24:15.280 --> 24:18.080
Everyone knows that Li Ni
is trying to breach Tong Pass.

24:18.280 --> 24:20.361
How can he simultaneously launch
an attack on us?

24:20.681 --> 24:21.080
Uh...

24:24.320 --> 24:25.921
It has already passed sunset.

24:26.681 --> 24:27.760
So, where is Li Ni?

24:28.720 --> 24:29.121
Answer me!

24:30.201 --> 24:30.760
Master.

24:30.800 --> 24:31.320
Oh, Master.

24:31.320 --> 24:31.841
Useless bunch!

24:31.841 --> 24:33.000
- What a useless bunch!
- Please, Master.

24:33.201 --> 24:33.701
Get lost.

24:33.800 --> 24:34.480
I said, get lost!

24:34.921 --> 24:35.361
Yes.

24:35.520 --> 24:36.401
We'll take our leave.

24:37.881 --> 24:39.560
Where did you get these?

24:39.720 --> 24:41.740
Cui Li has been ordering his men
to monitor Lieutenant He.

24:41.740 --> 24:43.180
These are the letters
he copied secretly.

24:43.720 --> 24:44.361
I obtained these

24:44.520 --> 24:45.480
from Cui Li's tent.

24:46.280 --> 24:47.480
But Lieutenant He knew

24:47.641 --> 24:48.800
about Cui Li's action.

24:49.361 --> 24:50.441
But she didn't pursue it.

24:56.040 --> 24:57.841
Master, calm down.

24:58.401 --> 24:59.720
I just remembered

24:59.881 --> 25:00.961
something important.

25:01.361 --> 25:03.401
Previously, Lieutenant He used a letter

25:03.601 --> 25:04.560
to set us up.

25:05.201 --> 25:07.000
This reminds me

25:07.161 --> 25:08.961
of how coincident it was.

25:10.161 --> 25:11.520
It happened

25:11.720 --> 25:13.681
after you met Pei Yuan.

25:17.441 --> 25:18.601
Are you saying

25:19.401 --> 25:21.240
that after I met with Pei Yuan,

25:21.401 --> 25:23.361
he disclosed the plan to Lieutenant He?

25:23.760 --> 25:26.601
The two collaborated to lure me in?

25:27.520 --> 25:29.641
But shouldn't we

25:29.961 --> 25:31.520
be on the same side

25:31.681 --> 25:33.401
when it comes to killing Cui Lin?

25:35.720 --> 25:37.760
If you want His Highness's letter,

25:38.161 --> 25:40.000
it depends on
whether you can kill Cui Lin.

25:41.280 --> 25:43.280
It appears
Li Ni has a close relationship

25:43.441 --> 25:44.841
with Lieutenant He.

25:45.040 --> 25:46.040
Otherwise,

25:46.201 --> 25:47.320
why would he share

25:47.480 --> 25:48.961
such classified information with her?

25:51.520 --> 25:52.681
I previously considered

25:52.881 --> 25:54.800
using Li Ni's hand to eliminate Lieutenant He.

25:55.040 --> 25:56.000
But now it seems

25:56.201 --> 25:58.080
not only he won't assist us,

25:58.601 --> 26:00.480
but he'll also be against me.

26:01.080 --> 26:02.520
Master, be patient.

26:02.961 --> 26:04.560
Those defending Luoyang

26:04.760 --> 26:06.601
are Li Ni's two older brothers,

26:06.800 --> 26:08.201
Li Jun and Li Lai.

26:08.681 --> 26:10.881
They have always been at odds with him.

26:11.800 --> 26:14.201
Why don't we join forces with them?

26:14.401 --> 26:15.641
This way,

26:16.080 --> 26:18.841
we can resolve our issue
of having no military authority.

26:21.921 --> 26:23.121
Excellent idea.

26:27.800 --> 26:31.240
(Tong Pass is a formidable stronghold,
easy to defend and difficult to attack.)

26:31.401 --> 26:33.641
(Li Ni led his army
and they fought for six days.)

26:33.641 --> 26:35.560
(With Pei Yuan leading the charge,)

26:35.560 --> 26:37.520
(they finally captured Tong Pass.)

26:41.361 --> 26:43.161
Congratulations, Your Highness.

26:43.720 --> 26:46.040
After the Zhenxi Army recaptured Dongdu,

26:46.361 --> 26:48.841
they captured Tong Pass
not long after that.

26:49.000 --> 26:49.961
Tong Pass?

26:50.760 --> 26:52.000
That means they're not far

26:52.121 --> 26:53.121
from Xichang anymore.

26:56.420 --> 26:57.110
Yes, Your Highness.

26:57.800 --> 26:58.881
They're getting close

26:59.720 --> 27:00.681
to Xichang.

27:06.201 --> 27:08.520
Li Ni chose not to contend
with his older brothers

27:08.921 --> 27:10.760
and directly abandoned Luoyang.

27:11.720 --> 27:14.641
He launched a surprise attack
on Tong Pass, which is 500 li away.

27:16.560 --> 27:18.441
A bad bamboo can sometimes
yield good shoots.

27:19.361 --> 27:20.480
Lord Liang

27:20.641 --> 27:22.760
sure has a capable son.

27:23.420 --> 27:24.161
Well, never mind that.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.000
Lord Liang's three sons

27:26.201 --> 27:27.641
are now close by.

27:27.921 --> 27:29.520
As their father,

27:29.570 --> 27:31.601
he has been held up in the capital
for a long time.

27:33.040 --> 27:35.361
It's time for him
to write letters to his sons.

27:37.681 --> 27:38.040
Sit.

27:42.280 --> 27:44.000
Shiqi, how did the battle go?

27:44.280 --> 27:44.681
Sit.

27:46.641 --> 27:47.760
The overall situation is settled.

27:47.940 --> 27:48.961
Don't pursue a desperate foe.

27:49.361 --> 27:49.881
What about you?

27:50.220 --> 27:50.921
Are you all right?

27:52.080 --> 27:54.121
These are just flesh injuries.

27:54.961 --> 27:56.201
Great.

27:56.681 --> 27:58.161
After battling hard for so long,

27:58.320 --> 28:00.161
we've finally taken Tong Pass.

28:00.881 --> 28:02.121
My father said

28:02.320 --> 28:03.881
Tong Pass is known
as the strongest stronghold.

28:04.121 --> 28:05.260
Since the founding of the nation,

28:05.361 --> 28:07.480
no army has been able to capture it.

28:07.800 --> 28:09.161
In the future,

28:09.320 --> 28:12.161
the Zhenxi Army can leave its mark
in the annals of imperial history.

28:12.740 --> 28:14.870
Now, the situation has shifted
from attack to defense.

28:15.201 --> 28:15.921
So after this,

28:16.080 --> 28:17.201
you'll only have to worry

28:17.401 --> 28:19.240
about how to defend Tong Pass.

28:22.080 --> 28:23.000
Shiqi,

28:23.361 --> 28:26.320
is there another Zhenxi Army in this world?

28:26.520 --> 28:28.220
There's also no other Shiqi
in this world.

28:29.240 --> 28:31.361
Then, the world doesn't have

28:31.800 --> 28:33.480
another courageous Pei Yuan.

28:33.641 --> 28:34.681
Don't flatter me.

28:35.520 --> 28:36.520
But Shiqi,

28:36.841 --> 28:37.760
I have a question.

28:38.240 --> 28:39.601
You know it's impossible.

28:39.800 --> 28:40.921
Why did you write letters

28:41.121 --> 28:42.520
to Lord Kuaiji and Lord Linzi,

28:42.681 --> 28:44.401
asking them to jointly encircle Xichang?

28:46.720 --> 28:48.760
My two older brothers
are as stubborn as mules

28:48.881 --> 28:50.161
from being spoiled by my father.

28:50.841 --> 28:51.921
If you want to go west,

28:52.320 --> 28:53.681
they will insist on going east.

28:54.320 --> 28:56.040
I don't want them
to act rashly and send troops

28:56.320 --> 28:57.560
to cause trouble to fight over merits

28:57.961 --> 28:59.361
at a critical moment like this.

28:59.680 --> 29:02.110
So of course, I have to write letters
to them to join the encirclement.

29:02.361 --> 29:02.881
When I do this,

29:03.000 --> 29:04.401
they're less likely to listen to me,

29:04.641 --> 29:05.961
and naturally remain idle,

29:06.121 --> 29:07.161
without taking any action.

29:07.681 --> 29:09.361
This is called reverse psychology.

29:09.770 --> 29:11.260
Saying one thing but doing the opposite.

29:12.520 --> 29:14.972
(Luoyang)

29:15.274 --> 29:16.107
(Recipient, Brother.)

29:19.609 --> 29:21.279
(Lord Linzi, Li Jun)

29:21.280 --> 29:23.410
(Please lead the troops. I'll siege
and recapture the capital.)

29:23.493 --> 29:24.758
(Lord Kuaiji, Li Lai)

29:27.121 --> 29:29.280
Jun, what did he write in the letter?

29:30.240 --> 29:31.320
Read it yourself.

29:35.641 --> 29:37.320
Li Ni has captured Tong Pass.

29:37.961 --> 29:39.240
He wants us

29:39.441 --> 29:41.240
to deploy troops to surround Xichang?

29:41.601 --> 29:43.520
Jun, what is he...

29:45.161 --> 29:46.681
Li Ni dares

29:46.881 --> 29:48.441
to order us around

29:48.601 --> 29:50.320
by relying on his achievement

29:50.480 --> 29:51.841
in taking Tong Pass!

29:53.520 --> 29:57.441
Jun, being ordered around is one thing.

29:57.800 --> 30:00.641
But deploying troops to surround Xichang

30:00.841 --> 30:01.841
is a serious matter.

30:02.161 --> 30:04.121
I'm afraid he intends to use our troops

30:04.601 --> 30:05.841
to help him achieve his goals.

30:11.921 --> 30:13.000
I've long known

30:13.000 --> 30:15.080
that Li Ni is treacherous.

30:15.961 --> 30:18.000
We can't

30:19.520 --> 30:21.520
let his plans succeed.

30:24.441 --> 30:25.121
Jun,

30:25.480 --> 30:27.601
didn't Cui Li of the Cui Army

30:27.760 --> 30:29.441
send a messenger here a few days ago?

30:30.641 --> 30:31.480
You mean...

30:32.280 --> 30:32.841
Jun,

30:33.520 --> 30:34.361
I think

30:34.560 --> 30:36.161
we can lend troops to Cui Li

30:36.681 --> 30:38.760
because he's lending the troops
to kill Cui Lin

30:38.961 --> 30:40.080
and put the blame on Li Ni.

30:40.320 --> 30:40.961
That way,

30:40.961 --> 30:41.641
he'll become

30:41.641 --> 30:42.720
a sharp blade

30:42.881 --> 30:44.040
in your hands.

30:45.080 --> 30:45.760
Young Master.

30:48.570 --> 30:49.320
You have returned.

30:50.480 --> 30:51.641
It must be a rough journey.

30:51.900 --> 30:52.800
How is Father's health?

30:53.000 --> 30:54.019
Great General is doing well.

30:54.019 --> 30:56.180
But when he heard Young Master Cui Li
came here without permission

30:56.180 --> 30:57.460
and interfered with military affairs,

30:57.520 --> 30:58.320
he was furious

30:58.961 --> 31:01.240
and ordered me
to bring the command badge to you.

31:04.720 --> 31:05.480
This is great.

31:05.841 --> 31:06.961
With this command badge,

31:07.320 --> 31:09.000
I can order Cui Li back to Yingzhou.

31:09.220 --> 31:11.270
Then I no longer have to worry
about him causing trouble.

31:11.320 --> 31:12.240
I can't believe

31:12.441 --> 31:14.881
Cui Lin resorted to all means
to obtain Uncle's command badge

31:14.920 --> 31:16.401
to order me to depart back to Yingzhou

31:16.560 --> 31:17.881
and not to follow the main army.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.601
Cui Lin, you jerk.

31:22.161 --> 31:23.760
Am I that dreadful to you

31:24.080 --> 31:26.320
that you try every means
to transfer me away?

31:27.401 --> 31:28.520
Master, calm down.

31:30.681 --> 31:32.280
We have received a reply from Luoyang.

31:32.720 --> 31:34.560
Why don't we read what it says?

31:41.779 --> 31:44.154
(Grant the title
of Grand General Weiyang)

31:46.201 --> 31:47.841
Master, what does it say?

31:48.841 --> 31:50.520
Li Jun has agreed to send troops

31:50.720 --> 31:52.240
to help me kill Cui Lin.

31:53.121 --> 31:55.560
Once I succeed,

31:56.560 --> 31:58.961
he'll appoint me
as Great General Weiyang.

32:00.320 --> 32:01.560
Congratulations, Master.

32:01.760 --> 32:03.641
Congratulations, Great General.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.560
As long as Cui Lin is dead,

32:08.881 --> 32:10.161
I will command

32:10.361 --> 32:11.681
the Cui Army rightfully.

32:12.000 --> 32:12.921
At that time,

32:13.121 --> 32:14.520
we can blame Li Ni

32:14.681 --> 32:16.121
for everything.

32:18.720 --> 32:20.201
Two birds with one stone.

32:21.320 --> 32:23.000
Absolutely flawless.

32:32.220 --> 32:34.280
No wonder it was so difficult
to conquer this place.

32:34.480 --> 32:35.881
Look at the city walls

32:36.201 --> 32:38.201
and the surrounding terrain.

32:38.401 --> 32:40.040
It's truly a fortress

32:40.280 --> 32:41.641
that's hard to breach.

32:41.920 --> 32:43.580
When we tried to capture it,
it was tough.

32:43.620 --> 32:45.560
But now that our roles have switched
to defense,

32:45.921 --> 32:47.480
these natural defenses

32:47.681 --> 32:48.760
are indeed advantageous.

32:49.361 --> 32:50.121
It is, isn't it?

32:50.520 --> 32:52.601
If Laolan Pass had half
of this natural advantage,

32:52.800 --> 32:53.441
we wouldn't need

32:53.560 --> 32:54.641
so many troops to defend it.

33:01.240 --> 33:03.641
Is it another letter?

33:07.121 --> 33:07.961
Mister Shiqi,

33:08.361 --> 33:11.240
you must be eagerly awaiting news.

33:16.224 --> 33:18.458
(Tong Pass)

33:18.480 --> 33:19.760
Report!

33:19.881 --> 33:21.720
An envoy from Xichang has arrived!

33:27.180 --> 33:28.681
Grand Governor sent me
to convey his order.

33:28.770 --> 33:30.980
The Zhenxi Army must withdraw from Tong Pass
within three days.

33:31.080 --> 33:31.760
Outrageous!

33:32.921 --> 33:34.881
Did Sun Jing send you here to die?

33:37.040 --> 33:37.760
General Pei Yuan.

33:38.080 --> 33:39.280
Since I dared to come,

33:39.300 --> 33:40.441
I'm not afraid of losing my life.

33:42.240 --> 33:44.280
Also, there's a letter from Lord Liang

33:44.800 --> 33:45.800
for you.

33:54.570 --> 33:56.450
What if I insist on
not withdrawing the troops?

33:57.121 --> 33:58.401
If you don't withdraw,

33:58.921 --> 34:00.961
then three days from now at noon,

34:01.320 --> 34:03.080
Your Highness
should prepare mourning attire

34:03.401 --> 34:05.161
to mourn Lord Liang.

34:06.560 --> 34:07.320
I suppose my father

34:07.441 --> 34:08.680
must have written three letters.

34:09.120 --> 34:11.000
The other two
have already been sent to Luoyang

34:11.000 --> 34:12.200
for my two brothers, right?

34:14.961 --> 34:15.640
Yes.

34:17.040 --> 34:18.241
I wonder,

34:18.600 --> 34:20.801
compared to Your Highness
and your brothers,

34:21.241 --> 34:23.200
which one of you is more filial?

34:31.920 --> 34:32.510
Lieutenant He,

34:32.770 --> 34:34.520
you still haven't finished
these dried nuts?

34:35.881 --> 34:37.921
These were quite popular
in Dongdu at that time,

34:38.040 --> 34:39.441
and people said they were delicious.

34:39.480 --> 34:41.120
Many people rushed to buy them.

34:42.361 --> 34:44.640
You're good at remembering
all these details.

34:46.841 --> 34:47.721
Originally,

34:47.881 --> 34:50.881
everyone just ate dried nuts
and kernels.

34:51.361 --> 34:52.361
But you prefer

34:52.361 --> 34:54.600
eating them with preserved fruits.

34:54.790 --> 34:56.640
How could I not remember
something like that?

34:57.361 --> 34:59.600
Moreover, kernels are indeed crispy
and fill the stomach,

34:59.680 --> 35:00.401
quite delicious.

35:01.401 --> 35:02.040
But,

35:03.080 --> 35:04.200
it's been days now,

35:04.761 --> 35:05.401
and Tong Pass

35:05.480 --> 35:06.801
hasn't sent a single letter.

35:07.600 --> 35:09.721
Are you worried about a certain someone

35:09.841 --> 35:11.600
or Tong Pass?

35:13.241 --> 35:14.080
Lieutenant He,

35:14.361 --> 35:15.961
I'm talking about serious matters.

35:21.820 --> 35:23.460
Perhaps something has happened
in the capital.

35:23.480 --> 35:25.110
So he might not have the time
to write letters.

35:27.801 --> 35:28.361
Lieutenant He,

35:29.241 --> 35:30.441
who are you talking about?

35:33.080 --> 35:34.361
Who is he?

35:36.321 --> 35:37.160
Who is he?

35:37.361 --> 35:39.000
Who is he?

35:40.721 --> 35:41.480
Even dried nuts

35:41.480 --> 35:43.401
can't stop you from talking.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.361
All right, I'll stop.

35:48.200 --> 35:49.000
But who is he?

35:56.761 --> 35:58.841
Shiqi, an urgent report from Luoyang.

35:59.040 --> 36:00.359
Lord Linzi and Lord Kuaiji

36:00.360 --> 36:02.540
have already decided
to withdraw their troops from Luoyang.

36:02.540 --> 36:03.400
(No movement from the enemy.)

36:03.401 --> 36:04.720
My two brothers have always been filial

36:04.720 --> 36:06.620
(Provisions are being transported)
since they were young.

36:07.401 --> 36:08.241
It's no wonder

36:08.361 --> 36:09.801
my father has always cherished them.

36:10.721 --> 36:12.480
Luoyang was originally an advantage

36:12.600 --> 36:13.640
they took from you.

36:13.761 --> 36:15.000
They naturally won't feel the pinch.

36:15.560 --> 36:16.600
But now,

36:16.801 --> 36:18.160
we're in a difficult situation.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
We absolutely cannot let go of Tong Pass.

36:21.040 --> 36:22.321
If Luoyang falls,

36:22.401 --> 36:23.881
our army will be cut off.

36:24.241 --> 36:25.281
But Sun Jing

36:25.361 --> 36:26.640
is truly ruthless.

36:26.761 --> 36:28.120
If we don't withdraw the troops,

36:28.200 --> 36:30.200
he might really harm Lord Liang.

36:31.321 --> 36:32.921
Shiqi, what do we do?

36:36.921 --> 36:37.921
Shiqi!

36:38.600 --> 36:40.321
From the emperor
to the common people,

36:40.340 --> 36:42.310
we all believe in
the importance of being filial.

36:42.441 --> 36:43.761
If we don't withdraw the troops,

36:43.921 --> 36:45.640
Sun Jing might really kill Lord Liang.

36:45.881 --> 36:46.600
When that happens,

36:46.721 --> 36:47.761
there will be an uproar.

36:48.040 --> 36:49.921
Those senior officials and army loyalists

36:50.000 --> 36:51.321
will all turn against us.

36:53.961 --> 36:54.921
Shiqi,

36:55.600 --> 36:57.040
what should we do now?

36:58.200 --> 36:59.640
Miss, you can't go.

36:59.801 --> 37:00.281
If you go,

37:00.300 --> 37:01.780
you'll be walking into a death trap.

37:02.040 --> 37:02.841
Qiucui,

37:03.200 --> 37:04.361
please don't stop me.

37:05.640 --> 37:06.560
I've never been favored

37:06.721 --> 37:08.480
by my parents at home.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.921
I almost lost my life in Bingzhou.

37:11.721 --> 37:13.801
If it weren't for Li Ni saving me,

37:14.160 --> 37:15.000
I might have become

37:15.080 --> 37:16.480
a mound of earth by now.

37:18.080 --> 37:19.560
When he saved me,

37:19.740 --> 37:21.520
he seemed like a god descending
from heaven.

37:22.640 --> 37:24.160
At that moment, I thought,

37:24.721 --> 37:26.600
perhaps he was the one
I'd been waiting for.

37:27.401 --> 37:28.560
To repay him,

37:28.721 --> 37:30.761
I'm willing to give everything,
even my life.

37:31.160 --> 37:32.560
But Miss,

37:32.761 --> 37:34.441
you've had a tough life
from a young age.

37:35.160 --> 37:37.120
If you really lose your life
because of this,

37:37.321 --> 37:40.160
I'm afraid there won't be anyone left
who truly cares about you.

37:41.160 --> 37:42.160
Miss,

37:42.480 --> 37:45.241
I want to go with you
and make it back to Xichang alive.

37:46.881 --> 37:48.520
Li Ni captured Luoyang

37:48.640 --> 37:49.600
and Tong Pass after.

37:49.920 --> 37:51.200
He advanced like the raging wind,

37:51.520 --> 37:53.281
showing he was not an ordinary man.

37:53.801 --> 37:56.480
He'll have a bright future.

37:57.080 --> 37:59.480
He's a person who values loyalty
and righteousness.

38:00.040 --> 38:02.120
If I help him in times of danger,

38:02.881 --> 38:04.721
he'll surely remember

38:04.961 --> 38:06.160
and repay me with gratitude.

38:07.401 --> 38:09.241
If I can help him now,

38:09.520 --> 38:10.801
do I have to worry

38:10.921 --> 38:12.040
about having no place here?

38:12.841 --> 38:14.921
If I don't strive now, when should I?

38:16.640 --> 38:18.000
Miss,

38:19.040 --> 38:20.321
why do you suddenly

38:20.441 --> 38:22.361
seem like a different person?

38:23.241 --> 38:26.040
Before, you never sought to compete
or vie for anything.

38:26.320 --> 38:28.110
Sometimes, when servants
were disrespectful to you,

38:28.321 --> 38:30.321
you wouldn't allow me
to stand up for you.

38:32.080 --> 38:32.961
Qiucui,

38:33.721 --> 38:35.321
I didn't strive

38:35.721 --> 38:37.600
because I didn't have the strength

38:37.721 --> 38:39.361
or the opportunity to compete.

38:39.841 --> 38:42.200
So why bother if it's in vain?

38:46.040 --> 38:46.921
In the future,

38:47.000 --> 38:48.721
you'll be my trusted confidant.

38:49.401 --> 38:50.921
You must also learn

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
to assess situations

38:52.401 --> 38:54.160
and choose when to act wisely.

38:54.801 --> 38:56.680
That's what smart people do.

39:09.080 --> 39:10.160
Greetings, General.

39:10.361 --> 39:11.640
Greetings, General Pei Yuan.

39:12.980 --> 39:14.110
Miss Gu, no need to be formal.

39:18.080 --> 39:19.841
I have a confidential matter

39:19.961 --> 39:21.560
to discuss with you.

39:26.921 --> 39:27.801
Miss Gu, please speak.

39:29.281 --> 39:31.480
I heard Sun Jing

39:31.560 --> 39:33.321
uses Lord Liang to threaten you.

39:33.881 --> 39:35.160
I'm willing to go to Xichang

39:35.321 --> 39:36.721
to act on your behalf

39:36.881 --> 39:38.321
and find a way to rescue Lord Liang.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.080
Do you have any plans?

39:43.961 --> 39:46.040
In the capital,
many influential and loyal families

39:46.241 --> 39:47.801
still support the country.

39:48.480 --> 39:49.841
However, Sun Jing is too powerful.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.120
So they dare not speak out.

39:51.520 --> 39:53.040
Please provide a token to me.

39:53.200 --> 39:54.401
When I return to the capital,

39:54.520 --> 39:55.640
in your name,

39:55.660 --> 39:57.220
I'll contact these noble families
in secret,

39:57.241 --> 39:58.881
and bribe the palace guards.

39:59.220 --> 40:01.950
Perhaps, by using a strategic approach,
we might be able to rescue Lord Liang.

40:01.961 --> 40:02.480
No,

40:03.040 --> 40:03.961
it's too risky.

40:05.040 --> 40:06.480
If Sun Jing finds out,

40:06.680 --> 40:07.881
or if someone betrays you,

40:08.160 --> 40:09.961
it could cost you your life and implicate...

40:10.080 --> 40:11.160
I'm not afraid of death.

40:11.600 --> 40:12.961
If I die for righteousness,

40:13.080 --> 40:14.520
it would be an honorable death.

40:14.961 --> 40:16.080
Even my father,

40:16.200 --> 40:17.480
I'm sure you know

40:17.620 --> 40:19.480
that he won't yield
to that traitor, Sun Jing.

40:20.040 --> 40:22.080
He will surely agree with my decision.

40:27.281 --> 40:28.841
Thank you for your loyalty, Miss Gu.

40:29.320 --> 40:30.910
I've already made an arrangement
in the capital.

40:31.160 --> 40:32.160
So you can rest assured.

40:55.560 --> 40:56.480
Jin'niang,

40:57.480 --> 40:58.600
did you say this letter

40:58.721 --> 41:00.080
was placed on the table,

41:00.680 --> 41:02.441
but you don't know who delivered it?

41:03.761 --> 41:04.441
Your Highness,

41:04.600 --> 41:06.600
could it be a trap set
by Grand Governor?

41:09.680 --> 41:11.721
No, it doesn't look like it.

41:12.080 --> 41:13.801
This letter is full of cryptic words.

41:14.401 --> 41:17.321
This letter is full of cryptic messages.

41:17.761 --> 41:18.921
But I understand

41:19.040 --> 41:20.801
what he's asking for.

41:21.361 --> 41:22.281
I think

41:22.801 --> 41:25.160
Li Ni wants to join forces with me.

41:26.281 --> 41:28.281
He must have been planning this
for a long time

41:28.640 --> 41:31.321
and finally had the confidence
to rescue Lord Liang.

41:31.721 --> 41:32.961
Your Highness, do we...

41:33.080 --> 41:34.361
Of course, we'll help him.

41:34.560 --> 41:36.120
Do as what was written in the letter.

41:36.640 --> 41:39.600
Move the orchid under the window.

41:39.920 --> 41:40.680
Yes, Your Highness.

41:53.321 --> 41:54.401
This is great, Miss.

41:54.420 --> 41:56.320
You don't need to take risks
by going to Xichang anymore.

41:56.321 --> 41:58.841
His Highness will surely have a way
to rescue Lord Liang.

41:59.040 --> 42:02.160
Although he hasn't explicitly revealed
the plan to me,

42:02.281 --> 42:03.721
through this incident,

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
I have become someone he trusts.

42:06.361 --> 42:08.321
Miss, are you planning...

42:11.921 --> 42:14.441
Li Ni and Lieutenant He of the Cui Army

42:14.441 --> 42:15.841
often have close contacts.

42:15.841 --> 42:17.210
They seem to share
a romantic connection.

42:17.560 --> 42:20.000
It's a good thing the Cui Army
has returned to Yingzhou.

42:20.281 --> 42:21.881
So they'll be far apart.

42:22.560 --> 42:24.080
If I'm someone he trusts,

42:24.560 --> 42:25.721
I'll naturally find a way

42:25.721 --> 42:28.160
to create some distance
between him and Lieutenant He.

42:28.961 --> 42:30.961
If you could marry His Highness,

42:31.200 --> 42:32.640
it would be great.

42:32.920 --> 42:35.110
Then, no one in the mansion
would dare to look down on you.

42:35.801 --> 42:37.680
But it's too early
to talk about this now.

42:38.921 --> 42:40.761
I wonder if His Highness will be able

42:41.120 --> 42:42.881
to rescue Lord Liang this time.

42:45.040 --> 42:45.921
To be honest,

42:46.241 --> 42:48.040
whether or not Lord Liang
can be rescued

42:48.640 --> 42:50.321
is entirely beneficial

42:50.441 --> 42:52.281
for Li Ni.

42:53.721 --> 42:54.520
Miss,

42:55.080 --> 42:56.841
I don't understand.

42:59.200 --> 43:01.200
If he successfully rescues Lord Liang,

43:01.721 --> 43:03.520
it would naturally be great.

43:04.080 --> 43:06.721
After that, Li Ni would have unrestricted
military power.

43:07.921 --> 43:10.080
If he failed to rescue Lord Liang,

43:10.361 --> 43:12.000
and Lord Liang was killed by Sun Jing.

43:12.600 --> 43:14.480
Even in his grief,

43:14.640 --> 43:16.480
he won't need to fear consequences.

43:17.241 --> 43:19.480
Even if there is public criticism,

43:19.921 --> 43:21.961
as long as Li Ni
holds military authority,

43:22.281 --> 43:24.841
who will dare to blame Li Ni
in the future?

43:29.040 --> 43:31.321
Since Li Ni likes intelligent people,

43:31.961 --> 43:33.600
I don't need to hide my cleverness

43:33.801 --> 43:35.560
in front of him.

43:41.160 --> 43:41.961
Do you think

43:42.080 --> 43:43.841
Li Ni will withdraw from Tong Pass

43:43.921 --> 43:45.281
like his brothers?

43:46.200 --> 43:47.000
What do you think?

43:48.841 --> 43:49.881
If a battle is lost,

43:50.000 --> 43:51.241
they can make a comeback.

43:51.480 --> 43:52.721
But once people's trust is lost,

43:52.841 --> 43:54.120
it's hard to get it back.

43:54.680 --> 43:55.321
His brothers

43:55.441 --> 43:56.801
are already leaving Luoyang.

43:57.120 --> 43:58.801
If Li Ni doesn't move,

43:58.921 --> 44:00.401
he'll be the subject of criticism.

44:00.640 --> 44:01.680
I think he'll withdraw.

44:02.520 --> 44:03.961
Li Ni is a clever schemer.

44:04.420 --> 44:06.400
He likely already has a plan
to rescue Lord Liang.

44:06.640 --> 44:08.600
Sun Jing is vigilant
in guarding Lord Liang.

44:08.721 --> 44:10.600
It won't be easy to rescue him.

44:10.820 --> 44:12.910
So, he needs to think carefully
and come up with a plan.

44:12.921 --> 44:15.040
Plus, he needs favorable timing,
location, and cooperation.

44:15.520 --> 44:17.281
But I think Li Ni

44:18.040 --> 44:19.080
already has an arrangement

44:19.200 --> 44:20.560
for everything.

44:20.801 --> 44:22.680
Favorable timing,
location, and cooperation?

44:23.000 --> 44:25.520
What is considered favorable timing,
location, and cooperation?

44:26.120 --> 44:26.841
Taozi,

44:27.600 --> 44:28.761
do you still remember

44:29.361 --> 44:30.921
the medicine you formulated for him?

44:32.801 --> 44:33.680
Lieutenant He!

44:35.120 --> 44:35.721
Lieutenant He!

44:36.000 --> 44:36.560
Lieutenant He!

44:39.961 --> 44:40.680
Lieutenant He,

44:40.881 --> 44:42.080
urgent report from Yingzhou.

44:42.120 --> 44:44.000
