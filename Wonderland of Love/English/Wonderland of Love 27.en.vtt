=Wonderland of Love=

01:41.214 --> 01:42.956
=Episode 27=

01:50.604 --> 01:51.283
Young Master,

01:51.470 --> 01:53.110
I've helped Lieutenant He
to settle down.

01:53.524 --> 01:54.923
She won't wake up

01:56.323 --> 01:57.644
no matter how bumpy the ride is.

01:58.964 --> 02:00.080
Now that we're parting ways,

02:01.804 --> 02:03.960
I don't know if we'll be able to
see each other again.

02:05.403 --> 02:07.043
Young Master, it was my pleasure

02:08.364 --> 02:09.723
to serve you all these years.

02:11.324 --> 02:12.364
Don't be silly.

02:13.244 --> 02:15.204
If Great General does rush inside,

02:15.484 --> 02:16.324
just tell him

02:16.484 --> 02:18.003
that I forced you to do so.

02:21.324 --> 02:23.044
You must protect yourself.

02:24.364 --> 02:25.403
Come and find me

02:26.204 --> 02:27.204
once you've escaped.

03:36.364 --> 03:37.644
What sound is that?

03:44.044 --> 03:46.123
That's the sound of the Cui Army's
heavy cavalry.

03:46.843 --> 03:48.364
What kind of heavy cavalry is that?

03:48.443 --> 03:49.964
Even the ground is trembling.

03:50.044 --> 03:51.044
That's the reason

03:51.044 --> 03:53.244
why the Cui Army was known as
the Army of Victory.

03:53.443 --> 03:55.003
Nothing can stop

03:55.003 --> 03:56.364
the Cui Army's heavy cavalry.

03:58.723 --> 04:00.123
No matter who

04:00.244 --> 04:01.764
or what formation is in front of them,

04:02.683 --> 04:04.683
the Cui Army's heavy cavalry

04:07.044 --> 04:08.484
will trample upon all of them.

05:16.403 --> 05:17.043
Ying?

05:17.363 --> 05:18.043
Ying!

05:33.004 --> 05:33.803
Run!

05:36.403 --> 05:37.283
Run!

05:39.843 --> 05:40.524
Run!

05:41.004 --> 05:41.884
Didn't you hear me?

05:42.564 --> 05:44.283
Run!

05:47.620 --> 05:49.723
This fellow is still useful to us.
Take him with us!

05:55.884 --> 05:56.483
Ying?

05:56.803 --> 05:57.564
Ying?

05:58.403 --> 05:59.084
Ying!

06:12.564 --> 06:13.684
Ying,

06:14.964 --> 06:16.723
you mustn't do this again.

06:17.884 --> 06:19.204
If you keep this up,

06:20.403 --> 06:22.043
you'll break my heart.

06:27.124 --> 06:28.124
Shiqi!

06:28.324 --> 06:29.803
I'm here.

06:35.764 --> 06:36.843
Shiqi,

06:39.843 --> 06:41.004
are you real?

06:43.483 --> 06:44.043
It's me.

06:46.723 --> 06:47.803
Did you know something?

06:48.524 --> 06:49.483
One day,

06:50.603 --> 06:52.324
I finally managed to escape

06:53.163 --> 06:54.324
and see you.

06:55.243 --> 06:57.843
In the end, I realized
that it was a dream.

06:58.163 --> 06:59.403
It wasn't real.

07:01.843 --> 07:03.283
You're seeing the real me now.

07:05.324 --> 07:06.270
Don't believe me? Look.

07:08.644 --> 07:09.324
It's true.

07:25.283 --> 07:27.444
We've gathered

07:27.444 --> 07:28.603
all the bulls we could find

07:28.603 --> 07:30.163
within 100 li radius.

07:30.644 --> 07:32.923
We tied barks

07:32.923 --> 07:34.204
onto their stomach.

07:34.684 --> 07:36.004
You guys have no idea.

07:36.004 --> 07:37.764
When the bulls were charging,

07:37.843 --> 07:39.243
the ground was trembling.

07:39.324 --> 07:41.764
The people from the mansion

07:41.764 --> 07:44.204
thought that it was
the Cui Army's heavy cavalry.

07:44.204 --> 07:47.043
They were so terrified
that they shouted:

07:47.163 --> 07:49.723
"The Army of Victory's
heavy cavalry is here!"

07:50.243 --> 07:52.884
It was such a magnificent scene.

07:54.243 --> 07:55.884
What's with your injury then?

07:59.283 --> 08:00.644
Don't mention that.

08:01.964 --> 08:03.243
When I was charging ahead

08:03.243 --> 08:04.644
with the bull,

08:04.764 --> 08:05.803
the Jieshuo people

08:05.803 --> 08:07.324
panicked for some time.

08:07.444 --> 08:10.124
But when they saw that it wasn't
the Cui Army's heavy cavalry,

08:10.764 --> 08:12.043
they started to fight back.

08:12.163 --> 08:13.564
During the encounter,

08:13.564 --> 08:16.004
I saw that Shu was running away.

08:16.084 --> 08:17.163
I went after him.

08:17.403 --> 08:18.483
I was injured

08:18.603 --> 08:20.723
due to my carelessness.

08:21.603 --> 08:22.843
Keep on bragging, won't you?

08:23.043 --> 08:24.843
That's more than just a minor injury.

08:24.964 --> 08:26.084
Listen,

08:26.084 --> 08:28.084
Bao has sustained serious injuries.

08:28.243 --> 08:29.843
You're not allowed to fight

08:29.843 --> 08:30.884
for at least one year.

08:30.920 --> 08:34.044
If not, even the deities can't save you
when your internal organs are ruptured.

08:34.363 --> 08:35.603
I can't fight?

08:35.603 --> 08:36.404
That's worse than

08:36.404 --> 08:37.804
forbidding me to drink!

08:38.843 --> 08:40.243
You can't drink either.

08:40.243 --> 08:40.763
You...

08:40.763 --> 08:41.830
But you can have some peanuts.

08:41.843 --> 08:43.164
Yeah, you should have more.

08:43.164 --> 08:43.964
Have more peanuts.

08:43.964 --> 08:44.804
Ear,

08:44.804 --> 08:46.363
you should hurry

08:46.363 --> 08:47.204
and marry Taozi.

08:47.324 --> 08:48.523
If not,

08:48.523 --> 08:50.483
she'll interfere
with our affairs all day long.

08:51.243 --> 08:52.404
Precisely.

08:52.964 --> 08:54.123
You're wrong.

08:54.123 --> 08:56.044
Miss Taozi still can interfere
with our affairs

08:56.044 --> 08:57.404
after getting married to Ear.

08:57.780 --> 08:58.804
- Wait.
- That's right.

08:58.804 --> 09:00.363
You didn't understand what Bao meant.

09:00.483 --> 09:03.444
After Miss Taozi gets married to Ear,
she'll only be minding his business.

09:03.444 --> 09:05.804
- She doesn't have time for us.
-  That's right.

09:05.804 --> 09:07.123
Miss Taozi is a righteous person.

09:07.123 --> 09:08.483
Even after she gets married,

09:08.483 --> 09:10.284
she'll still tend to us if we're injured.

09:11.603 --> 09:12.603
Touch wood.

09:12.603 --> 09:13.804
I don't want to get injured.

09:13.804 --> 09:14.564
Miss Taozi,

09:14.564 --> 09:15.924
you don't need to worry about me.

09:16.284 --> 09:17.164
Miss Taozi

09:17.164 --> 09:18.723
doesn't need to worry about us.

09:18.723 --> 09:20.400
She only needs to worry about
the number

09:20.410 --> 09:22.324
of children she'll have with Ear.

09:22.324 --> 09:23.003
Am I right?

09:23.003 --> 09:24.883
- That's right!
- Get yourself some babies!

09:25.164 --> 09:25.564
Taozi!

09:26.564 --> 09:27.564
Miss Taozi, don't go!

09:27.564 --> 09:28.363
Taozi! How many children?

09:28.363 --> 09:28.964
Miss Taozi!

09:28.964 --> 09:29.763
How many children?

09:29.763 --> 09:30.924
- Go away!
- What about a dozen?

09:30.924 --> 09:32.324
Taozi, don't listen to their nonsense.

09:33.324 --> 09:34.550
They're just spouting nonsense.

09:34.620 --> 09:35.210
Don't be angry.

09:36.723 --> 09:39.444
(Qingyun Temple)
Greetings, Your Highness. I, Han Chang, am here.

09:39.820 --> 09:41.260
General Han, spare the formalities.

09:43.003 --> 09:43.763
Now,

09:44.003 --> 09:45.483
I'm just a cultivator.

09:46.243 --> 09:47.483
Please do not mention

09:47.804 --> 09:49.204
my past titles again.

09:50.404 --> 09:50.843
Yes.

09:52.804 --> 09:53.763
Please have a seat.

10:02.324 --> 10:03.284
His Highness

10:03.324 --> 10:04.204
is doing well.

10:05.003 --> 10:06.404
He was elated when he heard

10:06.420 --> 10:07.523
that I was going to see you.

10:08.044 --> 10:11.084
He wished that he could see you
personally one day.

10:12.924 --> 10:14.643
He must be much taller now.

10:18.120 --> 10:19.960
The situation in the capital
is still chaotic.

10:20.324 --> 10:20.883
If not,

10:21.523 --> 10:23.044
I would've brought him here secretly.

10:25.404 --> 10:26.964
Lord Qin once promised me

10:27.320 --> 10:29.110
that he would assist
the great imperial grandson

10:29.204 --> 10:30.243
to ascend the throne.

10:32.363 --> 10:33.924
Even now, you still think

10:34.603 --> 10:35.763
that Lord Qin is trustworthy?

10:38.684 --> 10:40.123
I still think that he's trustworthy.

10:40.620 --> 10:41.940
Although Lord Qin is trustworthy,

10:42.643 --> 10:45.324
Lord Xin and Lord Qi have the intention
of usurping the throne.

10:46.444 --> 10:47.620
Lord Xin is the eldest prince.

10:47.924 --> 10:48.964
Lord Qi is ranked second.

10:49.570 --> 10:51.780
However, Lord Qin has rendered
plenty of military merit.

10:51.790 --> 10:53.180
His siblings are
extremely jealous.

10:54.123 --> 10:56.044
Lord Xin is heartless and unfaithful.

10:57.003 --> 10:57.723
He's easily

10:58.164 --> 10:59.204
irritable

10:59.723 --> 11:00.804
and ruthless.

11:01.643 --> 11:02.843
However, he's quite dense.

11:04.164 --> 11:07.444
I could tell from the incident
where he murdered his wife.

11:08.684 --> 11:09.684
I just hope

11:09.964 --> 11:11.564
that he could be imprisoned forever.

11:13.363 --> 11:13.924
Yes.

11:14.820 --> 11:17.510
I will contact the old subordinates
loyal to the late crown prince.

11:18.123 --> 11:19.084
I'll make sure Lord Xin

11:19.763 --> 11:20.883
stay imprisoned.

11:21.924 --> 11:23.164
As for Lord Qi,

11:23.420 --> 11:25.500
although he's trying his best to
hide his intention,

11:25.684 --> 11:26.883
people can tell

11:27.404 --> 11:28.883
that he has his eyes on

11:29.044 --> 11:30.284
the crown prince's throne.

11:31.564 --> 11:32.363
He's only

11:33.363 --> 11:36.444
witty without possessing true intelligence.

11:37.564 --> 11:39.363
He'll give himself away eventually.

11:39.883 --> 11:41.643
When that happens, we can take him down

11:41.964 --> 11:43.044
in one fell swoop.

11:45.243 --> 11:45.723
Yes.

11:54.723 --> 11:55.404
She's here.

11:55.420 --> 11:57.723
Miss Cui, please try the Zhenxi Army's
special roasted lamb.

11:57.723 --> 11:58.363
Thank you.

11:58.723 --> 11:59.483
Let me have a try.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.200
- Let's eat.
- It's delicious.

12:01.363 --> 12:02.084
Mister Shiqi.

12:02.120 --> 12:02.603
Yeah, right?

12:03.964 --> 12:04.883
Mister Shiqi,

12:05.324 --> 12:08.164
we've been hiding something
from you all along.

12:09.603 --> 12:10.523
What is it?

12:10.523 --> 12:12.763
Did you drink in Fengying Pavilion
without my permission again?

12:13.483 --> 12:14.763
That's not it.

12:15.164 --> 12:15.804
Before this,

12:15.804 --> 12:16.444
I asked you

12:16.444 --> 12:17.723
for some money so that

12:17.723 --> 12:19.603
we could drink in Fengying Pavilion.

12:19.603 --> 12:20.670
Actually, that wasn't the case.

12:20.684 --> 12:21.804
We spent the money

12:21.804 --> 12:23.123
on something else.

12:23.123 --> 12:24.483
Bao, you shouldn't say that.

12:24.483 --> 12:25.404
You're making it as if

12:25.564 --> 12:26.804
we spent the money

12:26.804 --> 12:28.044
on somewhere indecent.

12:28.044 --> 12:28.804
That's right.

12:29.736 --> 12:30.776
You guys spent the money

12:30.776 --> 12:31.736
on somewhere indecent?

12:31.736 --> 12:32.736
What kind of place?

12:32.736 --> 12:33.937
It's that place
in Fengying Pavilion...

12:33.937 --> 12:36.097
Taozi, eat up.

12:36.097 --> 12:37.457
Yeah, you should eat up.

12:37.457 --> 12:37.937
Have some lamb.

12:37.937 --> 12:38.720
What kind of place?

12:38.817 --> 12:39.416
I don't know.

12:39.577 --> 12:41.697
We spent that money to rescue a person.

12:42.297 --> 12:42.937
That's right.

12:42.937 --> 12:44.457
That's right. We rescued a person.

12:44.457 --> 12:45.337
That's right.

12:45.776 --> 12:47.896
No, we rescued two people.

12:48.177 --> 12:49.016
That's right. Two.

12:49.016 --> 12:49.510
That's right.

12:49.536 --> 12:50.496
We saved Madam Qin

12:50.496 --> 12:52.177
and her daughter, Xi.

12:52.337 --> 12:54.496
War has been going on
for quite some time.

12:54.496 --> 12:55.416
Madam Qin's husband

12:55.416 --> 12:56.937
was beaten to death
because he couldn't return

12:56.937 --> 12:58.500
the grain borrowed
from the imperial mansion.

12:58.500 --> 12:59.857
Madam Qin couldn't repay his debt

12:59.857 --> 13:01.136
even when she's a performer.

13:01.136 --> 13:02.896
The troupe leader was forcing her
to be a prostitute.

13:02.896 --> 13:04.977
He even wanted to sell her daughter off, Xi.

13:04.977 --> 13:06.776
She's only four years old.

13:06.776 --> 13:08.136
Can we stand for that?

13:08.136 --> 13:09.736
Of course not!

13:09.896 --> 13:11.256
After our discussion,

13:11.256 --> 13:13.817
we redeemed Madam Qin from the troupe.

13:14.097 --> 13:15.496
We helped Madam Qin

13:15.496 --> 13:17.917
to settle down in Youde's hometown.

13:17.917 --> 13:19.256
And, we even made
three straw huts for her.

13:19.256 --> 13:20.896
It's in Zhao Village,
Pangxiang Sanlichong,

13:20.896 --> 13:22.697
Yizhou, Ju Prefecture.

13:22.697 --> 13:24.217
Sanlichong is a great place.

13:24.217 --> 13:25.256
There are mountains and rivers.

13:25.256 --> 13:27.016
There are also plenty of
ducklings in the river.

13:27.016 --> 13:27.857
Ducklings.

13:27.857 --> 13:28.697
That's right.

13:28.697 --> 13:29.577
They can lay eggs too.

13:30.297 --> 13:32.136
All those ducklings will breed
new ducklings.

13:32.656 --> 13:33.416
Mister Shiqi,

13:33.420 --> 13:35.697
by then, we'll return to Laolan Pass
together with you.

13:35.697 --> 13:36.217
That's right.

13:36.217 --> 13:37.256
Return to Laolan Pass!

13:37.577 --> 13:38.376
Head to Sanlichong!

13:38.376 --> 13:39.136
Mister Shiqi,

13:39.136 --> 13:40.496
we already came to an agreement.

13:40.496 --> 13:42.280
We'll retire from the military
when we get old.

13:42.297 --> 13:44.896
We'll move to Sanlichong
from Laolan Pass.

13:44.896 --> 13:46.016
You can visit us

13:46.016 --> 13:47.177
when you're bored.

13:47.857 --> 13:48.896
Come and visit us.

13:49.016 --> 13:49.736
Mister Shiqi,

13:49.736 --> 13:50.496
we've realized

13:50.496 --> 13:51.416
your bragging for you.

13:51.616 --> 13:52.776
16 mu of fertile land

13:52.776 --> 13:55.177
and four top-grade cows,
we've already prepared them for you.

13:55.177 --> 13:56.457
We've prepared them for you.

13:57.577 --> 13:59.616
If that's the case, I think...

14:00.136 --> 14:01.697
All right. It's a deal!

14:01.697 --> 14:03.577
It's a deal!

14:03.697 --> 14:05.577
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

15:05.736 --> 15:07.016
Yingzhou is a cold place.

15:07.177 --> 15:08.610
There are rarely any fireflies there.

15:09.016 --> 15:10.990
You're considered lucky
if you can encounter one

15:11.057 --> 15:12.457
during the eve of fall.

15:13.817 --> 15:14.656
However,

15:14.776 --> 15:16.496
on the night I was born,

15:17.097 --> 15:18.217
a firefly

15:18.217 --> 15:19.616
flew in from the window

15:19.790 --> 15:21.577
and stopped on top
of my swaddling clothes.

15:21.736 --> 15:23.937
It was gleaming.

15:24.376 --> 15:25.376
That's why Mother

15:25.376 --> 15:28.097
gave me the nickname, Ying.

15:29.697 --> 15:30.577
So, that's how

15:30.577 --> 15:31.416
you got your name.

15:34.097 --> 15:35.416
I got my name

15:35.697 --> 15:38.297
from Bureau of Imperial Clan.

15:40.016 --> 15:41.337
It has a positive meaning.

15:42.496 --> 15:45.057
They hoped that I could
be witty and intelligent.

15:45.416 --> 15:46.616
That's why they named me Ni.

15:47.656 --> 15:48.256
However,

15:48.256 --> 15:49.697
I didn't have a nickname.

15:50.496 --> 15:52.937
My nanny called me Shiqi since young.

15:53.217 --> 15:55.457
Everyone started calling me that eventually.

15:57.817 --> 15:58.857
If so,

15:59.656 --> 16:01.097
I'll only call you Shiqi from now on.

16:03.656 --> 16:04.457
I was so furious

16:04.457 --> 16:07.536
when you addressed me as Lord Qin.

16:23.297 --> 16:26.577
My father knew that I liked fireflies
since I was young.

16:26.697 --> 16:28.097
He always told me this:

16:28.416 --> 16:29.177
"Ying,

16:29.297 --> 16:30.937
I'll catch a firefly for you.

16:30.937 --> 16:32.817
Promise me one thing after that, okay?"

16:33.256 --> 16:34.776
He either made me read

16:34.776 --> 16:36.097
or write.

16:36.256 --> 16:37.536
But I always tricked him.

16:37.656 --> 16:38.736
I told him this:

16:38.857 --> 16:39.697
"Father,

16:40.016 --> 16:41.697
one firefly isn't enough.

16:41.857 --> 16:43.496
You have to catch 100 fireflies for me

16:43.496 --> 16:44.770
before I'll make you a promise."

16:45.977 --> 16:47.776
But he was too busy.

16:47.977 --> 16:49.376
He didn't have the time

16:49.536 --> 16:50.896
to catch them for me.

16:52.097 --> 16:53.136
Therefore,

16:53.416 --> 16:55.217
I've never witnessed

16:55.416 --> 16:57.656
how it looked like
when 100 fireflies were together.

17:01.457 --> 17:02.857
But tonight,

17:03.217 --> 17:04.097
I'm sure there are

17:04.097 --> 17:05.376
at least 100 fireflies here.

17:12.857 --> 17:13.570
Give me your hand.

17:34.257 --> 17:34.936
Ying,

17:35.857 --> 17:38.216
I'll catch 100 fireflies for you.

17:38.777 --> 17:40.136
Can you promise me one thing?

17:47.297 --> 17:48.577
I won't.

17:50.936 --> 17:52.616
I won't agree to it

17:52.976 --> 17:54.737
no matter how many fireflies

17:55.777 --> 17:56.936
you catch for me.

Your Majesty,

20:16.097 --> 20:17.216
Baishui Pass

20:17.216 --> 20:18.976
is a key point in Lianzhou.

20:19.577 --> 20:21.136
It's the most important gateway

20:21.136 --> 20:22.456
to our north.

20:22.696 --> 20:23.896
Yanzhou and Zhuozhou

20:23.896 --> 20:25.857
lie beyond Baishui Pass.

20:25.970 --> 20:27.416
There's no defensible position there.

20:27.630 --> 20:29.656
They can only fend off our enemies
near Mang River.

20:30.737 --> 20:32.017
Jieshuo's cavalry

20:32.017 --> 20:35.057
can actually go straight
for Shuozhou's inland.

20:36.696 --> 20:37.376
Your Majesty,

20:37.857 --> 20:40.257
how were they able
to capture Baishui Pass?

20:40.376 --> 20:41.376
That's an important pass

20:41.497 --> 20:43.456
for us to keep Jieshuo at bay.

20:44.337 --> 20:45.976
Cui Yi, General Pingliang,

20:46.097 --> 20:48.136
should have stationed
his main army there.

20:48.896 --> 20:50.210
According to the emergency report,

20:50.577 --> 20:52.057
the defending general of Baishui Pass

20:52.057 --> 20:53.936
was convinced by Liu Chengfeng,
Cui Yi's adopted son,

20:53.936 --> 20:56.696
to surrender to Jieshuo.

20:56.976 --> 20:59.057
Cities southward of Baishui Pass

20:59.176 --> 21:00.497
were filled with fire and smoke.

21:00.616 --> 21:03.416
They were trampled upon by
Jieshuo's cavalry.

21:03.616 --> 21:05.057
We need a few more days

21:05.057 --> 21:07.936
before we could hear about the details.

21:08.537 --> 21:10.176
I heard

21:10.220 --> 21:11.817
that a few days ago, Cui Yi left Luoyang

21:11.817 --> 21:12.696
together with his army

21:12.696 --> 21:13.656
and headed northward.

21:14.337 --> 21:16.497
What does Cui Yi mean by that?

21:16.650 --> 21:19.057
Since his adopted son was the one
who captured Baishui Pass,

21:19.136 --> 21:20.176
if Cui Yi

21:20.176 --> 21:22.057
was colluding with Jieshuo all along,

21:22.057 --> 21:22.896
I'm afraid

21:22.936 --> 21:24.737
our nation is in peril now.

21:25.176 --> 21:26.216
Where's Lord Qin?

21:29.216 --> 21:30.737
He wants to fight

21:30.857 --> 21:32.696
whenever I don't need him.

21:32.720 --> 21:34.510
But where has he gone to
when I need him now?

21:35.616 --> 21:36.896
That brat!

21:38.176 --> 21:40.176
He just has to make me mad, huh?

21:45.817 --> 21:46.737
Jun,

21:47.216 --> 21:49.337
Father still sees you
as his favorite son.

21:49.976 --> 21:51.656
However, some officials

21:51.656 --> 21:52.896
appeared out of nowhere

21:53.017 --> 21:55.017
and demanded you
to be severely punished.

21:55.120 --> 21:56.777
Putting you
under house arrest wasn't enough.

21:56.790 --> 21:58.817
They wanted Father to strip you
of your title too.

21:59.337 --> 22:00.936
Father wasn't happy
when he heard that.

22:01.097 --> 22:03.416
But it was inappropriate for him
to defend you in public.

22:03.737 --> 22:05.376
It's all Li Ni...

22:05.537 --> 22:06.300
It's all his fault.

22:07.017 --> 22:07.896
By the way, Jun,

22:08.416 --> 22:09.297
this time, Father

22:09.297 --> 22:10.936
was truly irritated with Li Ni.

22:11.097 --> 22:12.577
He even reprimanded him today.

22:12.590 --> 22:15.010
He said not only did he leave the capital
without an imperial edict,

22:15.097 --> 22:16.456
but he also went

22:16.456 --> 22:18.136
to your imperial mansion,

22:18.136 --> 22:19.337
stole the grain there,

22:19.337 --> 22:20.817
and distributed them to the farmers.

22:21.216 --> 22:22.656
He went overboard!

22:23.817 --> 22:25.337
He's bent on going against me!

22:25.936 --> 22:27.817
He wants to embarrass me!

22:27.936 --> 22:29.817
How dare he...

22:29.817 --> 22:30.896
How dare he rob my mansion

22:30.896 --> 22:32.376
when I'm under house arrest?

22:32.577 --> 22:33.577
Father said

22:33.577 --> 22:34.537
he was expecting

22:34.537 --> 22:36.136
Li Ni to fend off Jieshuo.

22:36.616 --> 22:38.136
But Cui Yi kept telling him

22:38.136 --> 22:39.577
that he was near Shuozhou.

22:39.577 --> 22:42.310
In the end, Father changed his mind
and let Cui Yi fend off the invaders.

22:42.337 --> 22:44.216
He even said that he would send him
to reclaim Luoyang

22:44.216 --> 22:45.696
after his return.

22:46.456 --> 22:47.777
In conclusion,

22:47.777 --> 22:50.297
he just owns the Zhenxi Army.

22:50.297 --> 22:51.817
So what if he can fight a war?

22:53.297 --> 22:54.416
We have no choice.

22:54.737 --> 22:55.656
The Zhenxi Army

22:55.656 --> 22:57.297
only listens to his command.

22:57.857 --> 23:00.136
The Zhenxi Army belongs
to the imperial court!

23:00.656 --> 23:01.976
It doesn't belong to him!

23:02.497 --> 23:03.976
People neglected that fact before this

23:03.976 --> 23:05.057
because times were chaotic.

23:06.057 --> 23:07.656
Now that the world is at peace,

23:08.097 --> 23:10.297
what gives him the right
to command the Zhenxi Army?

23:10.297 --> 23:11.616
Doesn't that give him

23:11.616 --> 23:13.456
the power to do whatever he wants?

23:13.456 --> 23:14.737
That's right, Jun.

23:14.737 --> 23:16.577
The officials have
already criticized him.

23:16.577 --> 23:18.696
Father told him off too.

23:18.896 --> 23:19.537
But even so,

23:19.896 --> 23:21.817
he still retains power
over the Zhenxi Army.

23:25.275 --> 23:28.094
(Cui)

23:32.777 --> 23:33.537
Father.

23:33.896 --> 23:34.696
Excellent.

23:35.176 --> 23:36.416
I'm glad that you're safe.

23:37.376 --> 23:38.456
Let me take a look at you.

23:39.896 --> 23:41.216
You're fine.

23:41.416 --> 23:43.936
Luckily, you just lost some weight.
You're not injured.

23:44.950 --> 23:46.297
Father, you've gotten slimmer too.

23:46.416 --> 23:47.616
You look frailer too.

23:47.620 --> 23:49.550
I'm sure it was because
you were worried about me

23:49.570 --> 23:50.936
while having to command your army.

23:52.136 --> 23:53.817
When I received a letter from Taozi

23:53.936 --> 23:55.857
saying that Lord Qin had rescued you,

23:55.936 --> 23:57.537
to be honest, that was the only night

23:57.896 --> 24:00.017
I could sleep.

24:00.777 --> 24:01.970
I was deeply worried about you

24:02.456 --> 24:04.497
from the start until the end.

24:05.777 --> 24:07.176
Sorry for making you worried.

24:18.456 --> 24:20.017
Why hasn't Lord Qin entered our camp?

24:20.616 --> 24:21.297
Is he afraid of

24:21.297 --> 24:22.817
the Cui Army's might?

24:23.936 --> 24:24.817
Father,

24:24.936 --> 24:26.017
Lord Qin sent me here

24:26.017 --> 24:27.017
to rendezvous with you.

24:27.136 --> 24:28.297
He'll be leaving soon.

24:29.656 --> 24:31.057
Look at him.

24:31.896 --> 24:33.656
He's not even sweating a bit.

24:33.660 --> 24:35.280
How dare he say
that he's making an effort

24:35.297 --> 24:37.136
to rescue my daughter?

24:37.416 --> 24:38.297
Father,

24:38.857 --> 24:40.896
he already took a huge risk
by leaving the capital

24:40.900 --> 24:42.470
with his army without an imperial edict.

24:43.656 --> 24:45.537
Tell his stupid father

24:45.817 --> 24:47.337
to chop off his head then.

24:47.416 --> 24:48.456
Father!

25:14.216 --> 25:15.737
He's actually leaving, huh?

25:18.176 --> 25:19.616
He rescued you, you know?

25:20.176 --> 25:21.456
Why didn't you send him off?

25:21.656 --> 25:23.537
Father, you just said

25:23.537 --> 25:24.857
you wanted his stupid father

25:24.857 --> 25:26.136
to chop off his head.

25:26.136 --> 25:27.936
That's a different matter.

25:28.456 --> 25:30.097
He saved your life, you know?

25:30.216 --> 25:31.817
Why didn't you see him off?

25:33.337 --> 25:34.057
Forget it.

25:35.216 --> 25:36.297
There's no need for that.

25:36.896 --> 25:37.896
I told you already.

25:39.976 --> 25:42.097
Everyone from the Li family is stupid.

25:42.216 --> 25:43.176
Father,

25:44.176 --> 25:45.896
whose side are you on now?

25:46.656 --> 25:47.777
He's truly hopeless.

25:47.777 --> 25:48.777
He's hopeless.

25:53.456 --> 25:54.456
Reporting in!

25:55.696 --> 25:56.456
Great General,

25:56.456 --> 25:57.777
Jieshuo has captured Baishui Pass!

26:02.376 --> 26:04.097
Father, do you remember

26:04.257 --> 26:05.696
what you should say about Cui Yi

26:05.696 --> 26:07.017
and Baishui Pass?

26:07.216 --> 26:08.737
You must refute Lord Qin

26:08.737 --> 26:09.777
and make him

26:09.777 --> 26:11.616
unable to speak up for Cui Yi.

26:11.737 --> 26:13.017
Don't worry.

26:13.216 --> 26:14.616
It's not that long.

26:14.777 --> 26:16.497
I can remember that.

26:17.696 --> 26:19.057
If so, I shall take my leave.

26:30.216 --> 26:31.297
His Highness has arrived.

26:32.416 --> 26:33.817
Greetings, Father.

26:39.976 --> 26:41.936
So, you still remember
that this is your home?

26:42.616 --> 26:44.976
I did go a little further
than I expected for my hunt.

26:45.376 --> 26:47.416
You said you went on a hunt, huh?

26:48.577 --> 26:49.616
If so, why were you

26:49.616 --> 26:51.456
at your brother's imperial mansion?

26:51.456 --> 26:52.416
And, you even robbed

26:52.416 --> 26:54.057
his mansion

26:54.297 --> 26:55.497
of food.

26:55.520 --> 26:56.976
Father, I was planning to ask you why

26:57.120 --> 26:59.370
you said you wanted to
release Lord Xin from house arrest

26:59.656 --> 27:01.497
on the imperial court.

27:01.970 --> 27:04.017
You want to release him
after such a short period?

27:04.257 --> 27:05.656
You're abusing your power here.

27:06.136 --> 27:07.410
The people will think ill of you.

27:08.257 --> 27:10.376
Don't tell me what to do here.

27:10.777 --> 27:12.656
You're the same
as those civil officials.

27:12.656 --> 27:14.497
You say that I'm abusing my power here?

27:14.577 --> 27:15.537
Who's the emperor here?

27:15.537 --> 27:17.057
You? Or me?

27:17.220 --> 27:19.060
Father, you shouldn't
say something like that.

27:19.257 --> 27:21.097
Don't try to lecture me.

27:21.777 --> 27:22.696
I dare not do so.

27:23.097 --> 27:24.257
You dare not do so?

27:25.216 --> 27:27.410
But you're bold enough
to do all the things, aren't you?

27:32.136 --> 27:35.497
Cui Yi left Luoyang
together with his army.

27:35.497 --> 27:36.737
I heard that his daughter

27:36.737 --> 27:38.416
had just returned to Luoyang.

27:39.216 --> 27:41.097
Not many troops were stationed there.

27:43.616 --> 27:45.136
Since you're back,

27:45.976 --> 27:47.497
you should reclaim Luoyang

27:47.616 --> 27:48.817
together with the Zhenxi Army.

27:50.737 --> 27:51.337
Father.

27:52.656 --> 27:54.656
Cui Yi is fending off Jieshuo
at the North.

27:55.136 --> 27:57.010
But now, you're ordering me
to attack Luoyang?

27:57.857 --> 27:59.577
What if Cui Yi hears about this?

27:59.896 --> 28:02.510
Father, aren't you afraid that this news
will affect their morale?

28:03.537 --> 28:06.416
Luoyang is imperial court's capital.

28:07.337 --> 28:10.136
Cui Yi has occupied it
shamelessly for a long time.

28:10.257 --> 28:13.537
Shouldn't we attack him
while he least expects it and reclaim it?

28:13.976 --> 28:15.817
I wonder what's on your mind.

28:16.737 --> 28:18.337
You love to fight, right?

28:18.337 --> 28:19.616
Now I'm sending you to fight them.

28:19.616 --> 28:20.950
But you're defying my orders here.

28:22.097 --> 28:22.696
Father,

28:23.320 --> 28:25.380
Cui Yi is fending off the invaders
at the frontline.

28:25.416 --> 28:26.857
We can't attack him
from the back.

28:30.136 --> 28:32.337
The military report
already stated the reason

28:32.456 --> 28:35.176
why Baishui Pass was captured.

28:35.337 --> 28:37.896
Cui Yi's son was the one
who convinced them to surrender.

28:38.297 --> 28:40.857
The defending general
spared him on account

28:41.057 --> 28:42.257
of their past ties.

28:42.257 --> 28:43.057
But him?

28:43.176 --> 28:44.817
He killed the defending general

28:44.936 --> 28:46.577
together with Jieshuo.

28:48.896 --> 28:51.216
Cui Yi raised a traitorous son

28:51.216 --> 28:52.936
who betrayed his nation.

28:53.616 --> 28:55.416
Everyone in the imperial court

28:55.416 --> 28:57.376
wants him to be punished.

28:57.830 --> 28:59.577
Prime Minister Gu was the one
who advised me

28:59.696 --> 29:02.857
to let him atone for his sin
by rendering merit.

29:03.257 --> 29:03.936
Father,

29:04.376 --> 29:07.577
Cui Yi severed his ties with his adopted son,
Liu Chengfeng, long ago.

29:07.976 --> 29:09.810
Because Liu Chengfeng
colluded with Jieshuo.

29:10.456 --> 29:12.537
The Cui family and Jieshuo
are sworn enemies.

29:13.136 --> 29:14.416
Of all the families to doubt,

29:14.420 --> 29:16.110
the Cui family shouldn't be the one
you doubt.

29:18.136 --> 29:19.176
Lord Qin,

29:21.057 --> 29:22.696
you've truly

29:23.376 --> 29:24.737
disappointed me.

29:26.136 --> 29:27.936
Let me ask you this.

29:28.120 --> 29:31.010
My order is for you to reclaim Luoyang
with the Zhenxi Army.

29:32.656 --> 29:34.017
Will you

29:34.497 --> 29:35.656
follow my order or not?

29:35.857 --> 29:36.976
I will not.

29:39.737 --> 29:40.857
Father, please permit me

29:41.097 --> 29:42.416
to return to Laolan Pass.

29:53.376 --> 29:54.497
Lord Qi

29:55.190 --> 29:57.017
will take command of
the Zhenxi Army for now.

29:57.456 --> 29:58.817
You can return to your residence

29:59.656 --> 30:01.456
and reflect upon your actions.

30:01.857 --> 30:02.577
Yes, Father.

30:02.896 --> 30:03.976
I shall take my leave.

30:13.013 --> 30:16.787
(Lord Qin's Residence)

30:20.297 --> 30:21.136
Shiqi!

30:24.720 --> 30:25.696
What are you doing here?

30:26.416 --> 30:27.297
Don't mention that.

30:27.616 --> 30:28.737
His Majesty allowed Lord Qi

30:28.920 --> 30:31.470
to take command of the Zhenxi Army for now
during morning court.

30:31.770 --> 30:34.290
Lord Qi ordered me and Father
to leave the capital immediately.

30:34.376 --> 30:35.616
Father will head to Lingzhou

30:35.896 --> 30:36.936
while I'll head to Bizhou.

30:37.577 --> 30:40.257
Lord Qi has premeditated this
for a long time.

30:40.720 --> 30:42.290
That day, Father was abnormally eloquent

30:42.376 --> 30:43.777
when he ordered me

30:44.456 --> 30:45.537
to reclaim Luoyang.

30:47.120 --> 30:48.936
Father can never
think of something like that.

30:49.216 --> 30:52.176
I assume Lord Qi was the one
who told him what to say.

30:52.857 --> 30:54.017
He's doing so

30:54.176 --> 30:55.777
to divide

30:55.936 --> 30:57.057
our forces

30:57.216 --> 30:59.057
and segregate the Zhenxi Army.

31:01.376 --> 31:03.097
I'm unhappy with life in the capital.

31:04.430 --> 31:06.337
We've been spending time
ever since I went to Laolan Pass

31:06.337 --> 31:07.456
while I was a teenager.

31:08.297 --> 31:09.497
You understand my feelings too.

31:10.497 --> 31:13.416
I think there's no point in living
in the imperial residence.

31:14.057 --> 31:15.017
The palace

31:15.537 --> 31:16.857
is even worse.

31:20.737 --> 31:21.857
But Shiqi,

31:23.057 --> 31:24.737
none of us can
return to Laolan Pass now.

31:32.456 --> 31:34.136
Ying always wanted me to understand

31:35.376 --> 31:36.136
that both Lord Xin

31:36.497 --> 31:37.337
and Lord Qi

31:37.577 --> 31:38.696
were untrustworthy.

31:40.376 --> 31:42.520
She said they shouldn't be the ones
ruling the world.

31:45.057 --> 31:46.857
She wants me to be the crown prince.

31:48.537 --> 31:50.097
But I promised Consort Xiao

31:50.420 --> 31:52.320
that I would assist
the great imperial grandson.

31:54.057 --> 31:55.097
Ying and I

31:55.777 --> 31:57.057
were deeply in love.

31:58.857 --> 31:59.976
However, we grew estranged

32:00.656 --> 32:02.057
because of this issue.

32:04.497 --> 32:05.376
Actually, I understand

32:05.376 --> 32:06.537
where she's coming from.

32:08.376 --> 32:09.537
However, there's something

32:11.216 --> 32:12.497
I haven't told her yet.

32:14.857 --> 32:15.737
Shiqi,

32:17.616 --> 32:19.497
what exactly are you worried about?

32:21.017 --> 32:21.857
That's right.

32:23.936 --> 32:25.337
I'm indeed worried about something.

32:28.176 --> 32:29.456
Sun Jing is dead.

32:30.176 --> 32:31.376
The world is at peace.

32:33.136 --> 32:34.376
Where should the Zhenxi Army

32:35.097 --> 32:36.416
go from here?

32:37.376 --> 32:38.456
Where should the Cui Army

32:39.337 --> 32:40.696
go from here?

32:43.737 --> 32:45.176
If I do become the crown prince,

32:46.257 --> 32:47.817
will the imperial court be able to agree

32:47.817 --> 32:49.480
that the crown princess
owns the Cui Army?

32:51.297 --> 32:52.857
Even if I do become the crown prince,

32:54.216 --> 32:55.216
Cui Yi will never

32:55.216 --> 32:57.057
hand the Cui Army to me.

32:59.176 --> 32:59.857
That day,

33:02.297 --> 33:04.097
Father ordered me
to reclaim Luoyang.

33:04.257 --> 33:05.337
I rejected him.

33:06.497 --> 33:09.857
He handed the Zhenxi Army to Lord Qi
out of spite.

33:11.097 --> 33:13.497
It's because I didn't want
to engage Ying in battle.

33:15.297 --> 33:16.777
But once I become the crown prince,

33:18.696 --> 33:19.656
I have no choice

33:19.656 --> 33:21.497
but to suppress the Cui Army myself.

33:34.535 --> 33:36.027
(Cui Residence)

33:37.456 --> 33:38.416
400,

33:38.857 --> 33:39.497
500,

33:40.097 --> 33:40.857
600.

33:47.416 --> 33:48.337
Where is he?

33:50.337 --> 33:50.936
Taozi!

33:51.936 --> 33:53.456
You scared me.

33:54.896 --> 33:55.416
Here you go.

33:56.017 --> 33:56.976
What is it?

34:01.497 --> 34:02.656
That's a lot of money.

34:03.577 --> 34:05.057
These are my savings.

34:05.337 --> 34:07.497
I forgot to give it to you last time

34:07.896 --> 34:09.177
as I was in a rush.

34:10.657 --> 34:11.976
This is a lot of money.

34:11.976 --> 34:13.080
Why are you giving it to me?

34:13.096 --> 34:14.137
Keep it for me first.

34:14.777 --> 34:15.976
We can use it in the future.

34:17.496 --> 34:18.456
In the future, I...

34:18.456 --> 34:20.056
Why must I keep it for you?

34:20.576 --> 34:21.456
In the future?

34:21.617 --> 34:22.976
What do you mean by that?

34:23.217 --> 34:24.137
I don't understand.

34:26.657 --> 34:27.376
Taozi,

34:27.697 --> 34:29.737
I thought you already said yes
to me last time.

34:29.896 --> 34:30.496
But you...

34:30.697 --> 34:31.857
Silly guy.

34:32.096 --> 34:33.217
I was just teasing you.

34:33.416 --> 34:34.857
You fell for it so easily.

34:36.536 --> 34:37.737
You scared me.

34:38.456 --> 34:39.016
All right.

34:39.177 --> 34:40.536
I'll keep this money

34:40.536 --> 34:41.737
on your behalf.

34:42.096 --> 34:42.817
In the future,

34:42.976 --> 34:43.576
I'll keep

34:43.576 --> 34:44.737
my money together with it too.

34:45.096 --> 34:46.096
Maybe

34:46.217 --> 34:47.857
we can buy some land

34:47.976 --> 34:49.376
or open a shop in the future.

34:49.496 --> 34:50.016
Okay.

34:50.337 --> 34:51.697
Whatever you say.

34:52.137 --> 34:53.697
You have to be more alert in the future.

34:53.817 --> 34:54.576
You mustn't

34:54.576 --> 34:55.617
be duped that easily.

34:55.936 --> 34:56.416
Okay.

34:56.657 --> 34:57.657
Let's go then.

34:57.657 --> 34:58.896
I'll bring you around Xichang.

34:59.297 --> 34:59.936
Let's go.

35:01.016 --> 35:01.576
Taozi.

35:02.416 --> 35:03.657
Over here. This side is busier.

35:05.496 --> 35:07.257
Mister Shiqi!

35:07.376 --> 35:08.536
Wake up!

35:08.896 --> 35:10.016
Wake up!

35:10.536 --> 35:12.297
Mister Shiqi, wake up!

35:13.217 --> 35:14.257
What's the matter?

35:14.617 --> 35:16.177
I have good news for you.

35:16.337 --> 35:17.896
Miss Cui is here.

35:18.496 --> 35:19.177
What?

35:19.337 --> 35:21.257
Miss Cui has arrived at Xichang.

35:21.257 --> 35:22.376
Taozi is here too.

35:22.376 --> 35:24.096
Ear is meeting up with Taozi
as we speak.

35:24.297 --> 35:25.096
I heard

35:25.096 --> 35:28.617
that Miss Cui came here just to seek
an audience with His Majesty.

35:30.317 --> 35:31.576
Seeking an audience with
His Majesty?

35:31.576 --> 35:33.496
That's what I heard from Miss Taozi.

35:33.657 --> 35:34.376
She said

35:34.376 --> 35:37.056
Miss Cui came here to seek an audience
with His Majesty

35:37.056 --> 35:38.297
on Great General Cui's behalf.

35:38.297 --> 35:39.137
Therefore, she hopes

35:39.137 --> 35:41.936
that she can seek an audience
with His Majesty during a court session.

35:43.940 --> 35:45.360
She's trying to drive me crazy here.

35:46.777 --> 35:47.617
Mister Shiqi,

35:47.777 --> 35:48.896
you shouldn't say that.

35:49.056 --> 35:50.617
Although she's here to see His Majesty,

35:50.857 --> 35:53.337
it's likely that she's here to see you.

35:53.456 --> 35:54.617
You'll break her heart

35:54.817 --> 35:56.217
if you say that.

35:57.416 --> 35:58.257
You don't understand.

35:58.857 --> 35:59.896
What do you mean?

36:00.016 --> 36:00.936
Teach me then.

36:00.936 --> 36:01.817
I'm all ears.

36:07.220 --> 36:09.110
The imperial court is fearful
of the Cui family.

36:09.177 --> 36:10.257
It's a controversial topic.

36:11.337 --> 36:13.376
All of them are like boiling pots
filled with oil.

36:13.617 --> 36:15.936
It'll explode as long as
there's a single drop of water.

36:17.137 --> 36:18.817
And now, she's adding fuel to the flame.

36:19.976 --> 36:23.416
Besides, she said she would seek
an audience with His Majesty

36:23.416 --> 36:24.610
on Great General Cui's behalf.

36:25.456 --> 36:26.976
That's beyond comprehension.

36:27.420 --> 36:29.936
Even Great General cannot enter the capital
without an imperial edict.

36:29.936 --> 36:30.737
Moreover,

36:30.737 --> 36:32.016
she's just his daughter.

36:32.297 --> 36:33.896
How could she attend a court session?

36:35.177 --> 36:36.576
The civil officials

36:36.576 --> 36:38.217
will drown her with their words.

36:38.896 --> 36:40.617
I don't understand at all.

36:40.737 --> 36:42.337
Why does it sound like

36:42.657 --> 36:45.777
you're worried about Miss Cui?

36:52.456 --> 36:53.737
She's witty and intelligent.

36:54.217 --> 36:55.576
I don't need to worry about her.

36:57.297 --> 36:59.016
Since she's already here,

36:59.936 --> 37:02.177
why don't you go and see her?

37:07.217 --> 37:07.817
No, I won't.

37:10.217 --> 37:11.096
Are you sure?

37:11.496 --> 37:12.777
I won't.

37:13.376 --> 37:14.376
Are you sure about this?

37:27.576 --> 37:28.876
(Go Classics)
The Ministry of Rites

37:28.876 --> 37:30.710
has been arguing among themselves
for the past few days.

37:30.737 --> 37:32.617
Even now, there's no result.

37:32.777 --> 37:34.217
I wonder when

37:34.257 --> 37:35.817
you can see His Majesty.

37:42.337 --> 37:43.217
Young Lady,

37:44.096 --> 37:45.857
do you wish to see Lord Qin?

37:50.896 --> 37:52.617
Lord Qin is something else.

37:53.456 --> 37:55.096
You've already been here for a few days.

37:55.257 --> 37:56.697
But he didn't even visit you.

37:57.416 --> 38:00.576
Last time, he rushed all the way there
just to rescue you.

38:00.976 --> 38:01.896
After that,

38:02.016 --> 38:03.617
he even sent you back to Great General.

38:03.737 --> 38:04.936
Back then, I thought

38:06.137 --> 38:09.337
that he was pretty nice to you.

38:09.976 --> 38:11.576
It's only been a few days,

38:12.056 --> 38:13.217
yet he's treating you

38:13.217 --> 38:14.697
like a stranger again.

38:16.456 --> 38:18.016
Have you met Xie Chang'er?

38:19.137 --> 38:20.297
Of course I have.

38:20.697 --> 38:21.217
If so,

38:21.217 --> 38:22.817
what has he told you?

38:27.016 --> 38:28.337
Nothing much.

38:28.936 --> 38:30.536
It wasn't anything important.

38:30.657 --> 38:32.096
If so, I assume Lord Qin

38:32.137 --> 38:33.056
has nothing important

38:33.056 --> 38:34.177
to tell me.

38:34.420 --> 38:35.710
That's why he's not visiting me.

38:37.096 --> 38:38.456
That's not the case.

38:38.520 --> 38:40.670
Although there was nothing important
he wanted to say,

38:40.896 --> 38:41.976
you see,

38:42.297 --> 38:43.617
Ear and I

38:43.617 --> 38:45.217
went to see an acrobatic performance.

38:45.416 --> 38:46.777
We even shopped around

38:46.777 --> 38:48.337
in the city.

38:48.697 --> 38:49.617
Even if

38:49.617 --> 38:51.177
there's nothing important to say,

38:51.337 --> 38:52.297
we're happy

38:52.297 --> 38:53.376
when we get

38:53.657 --> 38:55.297
to take a walk together.

38:55.976 --> 38:57.657
Why are you flustered when Lord Qin

38:58.217 --> 38:59.576
isn't visiting me?

39:00.576 --> 39:02.137
I'm not flustered.

39:02.337 --> 39:03.817
I'm just worried about you.

39:04.420 --> 39:05.096
Worried about me?

39:05.096 --> 39:06.016
I was just thinking

39:06.016 --> 39:07.976
that you might want to see Lord Qin.

39:08.737 --> 39:09.536
Could it be...

39:09.750 --> 39:11.657
Could it be that
you wish to see someone else?

39:13.257 --> 39:14.257
That's not true.

39:17.096 --> 39:18.337
What a lousy whistle.

39:24.257 --> 39:24.936
Taozi!

39:24.959 --> 39:25.530
(Cui Residence)

39:25.536 --> 39:27.376
(Cui Residence)
What took you so long?

39:27.690 --> 39:30.416
Mister Shiqi was treating everyone
to a drink at Fengying Pavilion.

39:30.416 --> 39:31.910
I rushed here when I heard the whistle.

39:31.936 --> 39:33.697
I was late because it was too far away.

39:34.016 --> 39:36.416
Did you say Lord Qin was treating
you guys to a drink

39:36.416 --> 39:37.456
at Fengying Pavilion?

39:37.657 --> 39:38.337
That's right.

39:39.777 --> 39:41.096
If so, did he say

39:41.096 --> 39:42.496
that he would visit Young Lady?

39:43.936 --> 39:44.697
No.

39:46.496 --> 39:47.817
What's wrong with him?

39:48.016 --> 39:49.576
Since he's treating you guys to a drink,

39:49.576 --> 39:50.936
that means he's not busy.

39:51.056 --> 39:51.857
If he's not busy,

39:51.857 --> 39:53.040
why didn't he visit Young Lady?

39:53.056 --> 39:54.896
Bao asked him the same question.

39:55.217 --> 39:56.777
But Mister Shiqi acted as if

39:56.777 --> 39:58.056
he didn't hear him.

39:59.817 --> 40:01.337
Why did they

40:01.737 --> 40:03.257
get into a quarrel again?

40:03.376 --> 40:04.177
Yeah.

40:04.617 --> 40:05.217
They seemed

40:05.217 --> 40:06.416
harmonious

40:06.857 --> 40:09.697
on their way back
after Mister Shiqi saved Miss Cui.

40:09.857 --> 40:11.536
They didn't argue

40:11.536 --> 40:12.496
or get into a fight.

40:12.657 --> 40:13.976
They were courteous to each other.

40:14.137 --> 40:16.217
Silly guy, what do you know?

40:16.456 --> 40:18.576
It's only troublesome when
they don't argue

40:18.737 --> 40:19.976
or get into a fight.

40:21.536 --> 40:22.337
This won't do.

40:22.737 --> 40:24.257
We have to think of something.

40:24.416 --> 40:25.536
What do you mean?

40:26.896 --> 40:28.177
Since

40:28.496 --> 40:30.297
he's not willing to see her,

40:30.737 --> 40:32.416
and she's not willing to see him,

40:33.416 --> 40:35.096
one of them

40:35.416 --> 40:37.137
has to

40:37.257 --> 40:38.576
take the first step somehow.

40:39.297 --> 40:41.257
Wait, come again?

40:41.257 --> 40:42.456
I'm confused.

40:43.137 --> 40:43.697
Got it.

40:44.496 --> 40:45.697
Let's buy some dried fruits.

40:46.720 --> 40:47.777
What's with that response?

40:47.936 --> 40:49.217
Let's buy some dried fruits.

40:49.896 --> 40:50.896
Come on.

40:50.896 --> 40:51.536
Hurry up.

40:56.320 --> 40:58.950
I heard that Fengying Pavilion's
the best restaurant in the capital.

40:58.976 --> 41:00.137
It does live up to its name.

41:00.870 --> 41:01.777
The food here is great.

41:01.777 --> 41:02.777
The liquor is great.

41:03.737 --> 41:04.896
Although it's great,

41:05.056 --> 41:05.936
it's a shame

41:05.936 --> 41:07.230
that Bao can't take alcohol now.

41:07.337 --> 41:08.177
Where's Bao?

41:08.280 --> 41:09.697
He said he was going to take a leak.

41:09.697 --> 41:10.297
Don't tell me

41:10.297 --> 41:11.137
he fell into the loo?

41:11.896 --> 41:12.896
Since he said that,

41:12.896 --> 41:14.056
I'm sure he went to the loo.

41:14.177 --> 41:15.777
Why did you say he fell into the loo?

41:15.777 --> 41:16.817
One can only take a leak

41:16.817 --> 41:17.617
in a loo.

41:17.617 --> 41:18.617
Is he going to somewhere else?

41:18.617 --> 41:19.496
But of course.

41:19.697 --> 41:20.416
What about this?

41:20.456 --> 41:21.337
Let's make a bet.

41:21.657 --> 41:22.456
Let's play a game.

41:22.697 --> 41:23.536
The winner

41:23.737 --> 41:24.297
will drink

41:24.337 --> 41:27.100
while the loser has to find Bao
and see if he has fallen into the loo.

41:27.257 --> 41:27.697
All right.

41:27.697 --> 41:28.456
Let's do it!

41:28.817 --> 41:29.576
Come on!

41:31.337 --> 41:32.576
My good brothers!

41:32.576 --> 41:33.857
Three stars!

41:33.857 --> 41:35.056
Five leaders!

41:35.056 --> 41:36.297
Six prosperity!

41:36.297 --> 41:38.817
Five leaders!

41:38.817 --> 41:40.096
Four wealth!

41:40.217 --> 41:41.416
My good brothers!

41:41.416 --> 41:42.657
Six prosperity!

41:42.657 --> 41:43.976
Five leaders!

41:43.976 --> 41:45.257
Eight horses!

41:45.936 --> 41:46.697
I won!

41:46.697 --> 41:48.857
Mister Shiqi,
guess who's in the next room?

41:49.657 --> 41:50.217
My turn.

41:50.217 --> 41:51.376
- Again!
- Let me take a bite.

41:51.376 --> 41:52.857
My good brothers!

41:52.857 --> 41:54.096
Seven wonders!

41:54.096 --> 41:55.536
Six prosperity!

41:55.536 --> 41:56.056
Eight horses!

41:56.056 --> 41:57.056
Three stars!

41:57.056 --> 41:57.896
He lost!

41:58.150 --> 41:58.496
I lost.

41:58.496 --> 41:59.056
Mister Shiqi,

41:59.056 --> 42:00.496
don't you wish to check it out?

42:02.137 --> 42:02.857
Fine.

42:02.857 --> 42:03.976
Anyway, I've already notified you.

42:03.976 --> 42:05.330
It's your business
whether you go or not.

42:05.657 --> 42:06.697
Come! Give it a try!

42:06.697 --> 42:07.456
Let's do it.

42:07.936 --> 42:08.896
Let's continue.

42:09.056 --> 42:10.496
My good brothers!

42:10.496 --> 42:11.976
One star!

42:11.976 --> 42:13.217
Five leaders!

42:13.217 --> 42:14.536
Seven wonders!

42:14.697 --> 42:15.177
Taozi,

42:15.576 --> 42:17.697
(Wolong Dried Fruits Store)
why did you buy so many dried fruits?

42:18.297 --> 42:20.217
Young Lady loves them.

42:20.576 --> 42:22.896
I intend to move her

42:22.976 --> 42:24.096
with these dried fruits.

42:24.496 --> 42:24.737
Bao,

42:25.376 --> 42:27.857
Taozi instructed us
to forbid you from drinking

42:27.857 --> 42:28.456
in the next year.

42:28.456 --> 42:28.990
Put it down.

42:29.576 --> 42:31.137
Fine.

42:31.896 --> 42:33.456
Bao, get us some peanuts.

42:33.460 --> 42:34.297
- Yeah.
- That's right.

42:34.297 --> 42:34.936
That's right, Bao.

42:34.936 --> 42:36.177
I have plenty of peanuts.

42:36.496 --> 42:37.217
Here you go.

42:37.230 --> 42:37.737
Give it to me.

42:37.737 --> 42:38.297
Catch.

42:38.496 --> 42:39.416
Eat up.

42:40.617 --> 42:41.737
What is this?

42:42.016 --> 42:43.297
Mister Shiqi, I'll give you two.

42:43.857 --> 42:44.536
Bao is so stingy.

42:44.536 --> 42:45.456
You're so stingy.

42:45.456 --> 42:46.777
Take it or leave it.

42:47.657 --> 42:49.056
This liquor is pretty strong.

42:49.137 --> 42:50.376
I need to take a leak.

42:52.016 --> 42:53.016
Mister Shiqi, take your time.

42:53.257 --> 42:55.496
Let's continue.

42:55.936 --> 42:57.137
Six six!

42:57.137 --> 42:58.737
My good brothers!

42:58.737 --> 43:00.217
Six prosperity!

43:00.496 --> 43:01.777
Come here.

43:04.297 --> 43:05.416
Place your bets.

43:05.536 --> 43:06.617
Let's make a bet

43:07.217 --> 43:09.857
whether Mister Shiqi
will check out the next room or not.

43:10.320 --> 43:11.016
Place your bets.

43:11.016 --> 43:12.896
I think he'll surely check it out.

43:12.896 --> 43:13.337
All right.

43:13.337 --> 43:14.217
Ten wen!

43:14.576 --> 43:15.657
He'll go, ten wen!

43:15.896 --> 43:16.536
Anyone else?

43:16.536 --> 43:18.137
He won't go, all-in!

43:18.217 --> 43:19.496
He has to go!

43:19.496 --> 43:20.137
All right!

43:20.857 --> 43:22.137
20 wen!

43:23.056 --> 43:24.257
He won't go, 20 wen!

43:24.257 --> 43:26.137
All right. He won't go, huh? It's a deal.

43:26.137 --> 43:27.217
No sore losers here, all right?

43:27.217 --> 43:28.257
- All right!
- All right!

44:04.576 --> 44:06.536
We can't hear anything.

44:06.536 --> 44:07.857
If only Ear was here.

44:32.777 --> 44:33.817
Young Lady.

44:35.617 --> 44:36.257
Young Lady,

44:37.137 --> 44:39.576
Lord Qin bought
your favorite dried fruits

44:39.576 --> 44:40.496
to deliver them to you.

44:40.777 --> 44:41.576
Really?

44:42.657 --> 44:43.337
Yeah.

44:43.657 --> 44:44.337
Young Lady,

44:44.456 --> 44:45.737
you might not know,

44:45.936 --> 44:48.056
but one has to queue for eons
before they can buy

44:48.056 --> 44:49.016
these dried fruits.

44:50.297 --> 44:51.096
Let me try them.

44:52.777 --> 44:53.536
He's back.

44:53.697 --> 44:54.737
He's back.

44:54.737 --> 44:55.617
Mister Shiqi,

44:56.177 --> 44:57.536
did you check out the room?

44:57.536 --> 44:58.496
Did you? You didn't, right?

44:58.496 --> 44:59.536
Did you enter the room?

44:59.817 --> 45:00.536
I didn't.

45:03.137 --> 45:04.297
Guys, accept your losses.

45:04.297 --> 45:05.416
Fine.

45:05.536 --> 45:06.536
Youde, here you go.

45:06.936 --> 45:07.857
Youdao, here.

45:08.137 --> 45:09.337
Mister Shiqi,

45:09.337 --> 45:10.536
why didn't you enter the room?

45:10.536 --> 45:12.177
I lost so much money because of you.

45:12.337 --> 45:14.056
You must have no idea.

45:14.936 --> 45:16.217
Mister Shiqi was the best scout

45:16.217 --> 45:17.536
we had.

45:17.536 --> 45:18.896
I'm sure he found out

45:18.896 --> 45:20.657
that there were two burly men

45:20.657 --> 45:22.177
instead of Miss Cui
in the next room.

45:22.177 --> 45:23.617
That's why he didn't fall for it.

45:23.617 --> 45:24.376
That's right.

45:24.376 --> 45:25.310
There were three people.

45:25.657 --> 45:26.536
Three people?

45:27.056 --> 45:28.737
But I only saw two people.

45:29.337 --> 45:31.617
They ordered liquor and food
enough for two.

45:31.617 --> 45:33.610
They only had two pairs
of chopsticks in the room.

45:33.737 --> 45:34.177
You...

45:34.536 --> 45:35.617
How did you find out

45:35.617 --> 45:36.976
that there were three people?

45:37.056 --> 45:38.416
One of them is downstairs.

45:38.416 --> 45:39.310
He just came upstairs.

45:39.857 --> 45:41.576
They are hemp traders.

45:41.710 --> 45:43.016
They just arrived from Xingzhou.

45:43.376 --> 45:45.016
They have plenty of money.

45:45.490 --> 45:47.297
The other guy went
to exchange his currency.

45:47.320 --> 45:48.857
He didn't want to
eat at Fengying Pavilion.

45:48.857 --> 45:50.016
He still came here eventually.

45:50.177 --> 45:51.017
That's why the waiter

45:51.017 --> 45:52.790
prepared another set of bowl
and chopsticks for them.

45:52.976 --> 45:55.297
Mister Shiqi is amazing indeed.

45:56.016 --> 45:57.337
I'm impressed.

45:57.456 --> 45:58.576
I told you already.

45:58.576 --> 46:00.536
Although Mister Shiqi
didn't enter the room,

46:00.536 --> 46:02.016
he could definitely

46:02.016 --> 46:03.376
figure out

46:03.376 --> 46:04.817
who was in the next room.

46:04.817 --> 46:05.936
You weren't willing to believe me.

46:05.936 --> 46:07.177
You just had to make the bet.

46:07.297 --> 46:08.056
Now, you've lost.

46:08.056 --> 46:08.697
Pay up!

46:08.697 --> 46:09.857
We'll pay up.

46:11.096 --> 46:12.297
- This is mine.
- I've lost ten wen again.

46:12.297 --> 46:12.936
Young Lady,

46:12.940 --> 46:15.300
since Lord Qin bought these dried fruits
for you especially,

46:15.337 --> 46:16.697
don't you think

46:16.697 --> 46:18.257
we should buy him something

46:18.257 --> 46:19.536
in return?

46:22.416 --> 46:23.496
They're pretty nice.

46:23.896 --> 46:25.337
At least you didn't queue in vain.

46:28.657 --> 46:29.737
How did you know

46:29.737 --> 46:31.536
that Lord Qin didn't buy
these dried fruits?

46:34.697 --> 46:36.496
You saw through at once, huh?

46:37.016 --> 46:39.016
I guess Lord Qin
wouldn't fall for it too.

46:39.896 --> 46:40.857
Fall for what?

46:41.280 --> 46:42.610
Xie Chang'er brought some of these

46:43.416 --> 46:45.456
back to him too.

46:45.657 --> 46:47.297
We intended to say

46:47.416 --> 46:48.416
that you were the one

46:48.416 --> 46:49.416
who bought these for him.

46:49.737 --> 46:50.777
But now,

46:51.416 --> 46:52.976
I don't think he'll fall for it.

46:54.456 --> 46:55.056
Here.

46:56.177 --> 46:57.817
The buyer should finish it then.

47:02.016 --> 47:03.896
I queued for a long time
just to buy them.

47:03.896 --> 47:05.137
They're pretty good.

47:05.416 --> 47:06.456
It must've been tough.

47:07.217 --> 47:08.400
Fine, I'll finish them myself.

47:11.016 --> 47:12.737
Here. Let me offer you a toast.

47:14.936 --> 47:15.896
Jun,

47:16.217 --> 47:17.777
I'm sure you know this too.

47:18.936 --> 47:21.310
Although Father put me in charge
of the Zhenxi Army temporarily,

47:21.376 --> 47:22.737
Pei Xian and his son

47:22.737 --> 47:24.177
would never obey my orders.

47:24.576 --> 47:25.617
My position

47:25.777 --> 47:27.617
is just for show.

47:28.257 --> 47:29.337
You're 100 times better

47:29.337 --> 47:30.857
than me.

47:31.320 --> 47:32.817
I'm stuck here for an unknown period.

47:33.217 --> 47:34.817
Jun, you shouldn't be so dejected.

47:34.950 --> 47:36.657
Right now, there's
an opportunity for you

47:36.657 --> 47:38.210
for you to make a plea
in front of Father.

47:40.416 --> 47:41.337
What opportunity?

47:41.777 --> 47:42.617
What opportunity?

47:43.456 --> 47:45.096
Mother's death anniversary is arriving.

47:45.376 --> 47:47.257
Father will definitely go easy on you

47:47.337 --> 47:48.817
on account of our late mother.

47:49.416 --> 47:50.137
You're right.

47:51.496 --> 47:53.257
Mother's death anniversary is nearing.

47:53.496 --> 47:55.217
If so, I'll submit a fold to Father

47:55.217 --> 47:56.536
to tell him about it.

47:56.657 --> 47:57.936
Maybe Father

47:57.936 --> 47:58.936
will release me

47:58.936 --> 47:59.857
on account of Mother.

47:59.857 --> 48:00.817
Jun, don't worry.

48:01.120 --> 48:03.376
I'll definitely do my best
to make a plea on your behalf

48:03.376 --> 48:04.536
in front of Father.
