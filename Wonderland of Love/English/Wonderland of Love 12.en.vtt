=Episode 12=

01:43.050 --> 01:44.450
(Letter to Cui Lin)

01:51.020 --> 01:52.101
The commander has returned.

01:53.621 --> 01:54.020
sir

01:54.380 --> 01:55.660
What is the situation in Yingzhou?

01:59.061 --> 02:00.261
The commander's father suddenly became ill.

02:00.660 --> 02:01.420
There's nothing wrong with the seal.

02:01.701 --> 02:02.461
Tootsin recalled.

02:02.621 --> 02:03.940
Tutsin was Father's confidant.

02:04.061 --> 02:05.660
He was attacked and injured along the way.

02:05.981 --> 02:07.020
After delivering the letter

02:07.101 --> 02:08.181
He fell down and died.

02:08.341 --> 02:08.940
sir

02:09.100 --> 02:09.780
Sir, an old disease has recurred.

02:09.940 --> 02:10.741
Or were they poisoned?

02:10.901 --> 02:12.181
It was not written in the letter.

02:12.341 --> 02:13.341
Sir, please allow me

02:13.461 --> 02:14.660
Take the cavalry on a journey

02:14.820 --> 02:15.540
Go get help immediately.

02:15.700 --> 02:16.820
It was related to Father's safety.

02:17.021 --> 02:17.861
I will go with you.

02:18.061 --> 02:18.581
cannot

02:18.700 --> 02:19.660
The army has a lot of baggage.

02:19.820 --> 02:20.500
It's not convenient to move quickly.

02:20.621 --> 02:21.581
It would be better for you to continue following the original plan.

02:21.700 --> 02:23.141
Bring the army back to support quickly.

02:23.260 --> 02:23.861
One more thing

02:23.980 --> 02:25.061
Your body has not yet recovered.

02:25.220 --> 02:26.301
urgent movement
several days and nights in a row

02:26.461 --> 02:27.741
Your body won't be able to take it.

02:27.940 --> 02:29.700
Ah Ying, I've made up my mind.

02:29.861 --> 02:30.540
you and me

02:30.700 --> 02:31.980
Take the cavalry to join together first.

02:32.141 --> 02:33.100
No need to argue anymore.

02:36.141 --> 02:36.660
can

02:55.100 --> 02:56.820
Respect the Viceroy

02:57.421 --> 03:00.500
Saluting to the Viceroy

03:02.500 --> 03:03.741
Your three children

03:03.861 --> 03:05.380
After receiving the letter you wrote

03:05.700 --> 03:07.741
Li Jun and Li Lai were quite grateful.

03:08.820 --> 03:10.461
Hurry and promise to retreat immediately.

03:11.061 --> 03:11.660
Send the letter back

03:11.820 --> 03:13.621
Please let me take good care of you.

03:15.301 --> 03:17.100
As for Li

03:19.940 --> 03:20.780
I couldn't imagine that he would slit his neck.

03:20.940 --> 03:22.820
Zheng Guogong's people then sent their heads back.

03:24.100 --> 03:25.780
(Letter to Viceroy Sun)
Plus one letter attached.

03:40.181 --> 03:41.301
(I'm not the eldest son.)

03:41.861 --> 03:42.901
(If you kill your father)

03:43.341 --> 03:45.100
(I must thank you for being emperor.)

03:45.500 --> 03:46.980
Li Ni called himself the emperor.

03:47.141 --> 03:49.100
Of course, it must be inherited.
Becoming Emperor after his real father

03:49.980 --> 03:50.741
Prince Liang

03:51.220 --> 03:53.061
This is a great auspicious matter.

03:53.581 --> 03:55.540
If I have an idea

03:55.660 --> 03:57.540
To betray like this

03:58.061 --> 04:00.220
Let the lightning strike

04:02.621 --> 04:03.741
You ungrateful son has slandered me.

04:03.940 --> 04:05.741
You ungrateful son, you are slandering me.

04:06.660 --> 04:08.100
The Viceroy is brilliant.

04:08.461 --> 04:10.301
The Viceroy is brilliant.

04:10.861 --> 04:12.780
The Viceroy is brilliant.

04:12.940 --> 04:14.901
The Viceroy is brilliant.

04:40.781 --> 04:41.900
Go call the royal doctor.

04:42.260 --> 04:43.421
See what happened.

04:43.820 --> 04:44.181
Please accept it.

05:08.741 --> 05:10.861
Find a way to let Hu Yin Weiguo know.

05:12.700 --> 05:13.140
Yes, sir.

05:22.820 --> 05:23.580
Viceroy

05:24.020 --> 05:25.260
Duke Liang's body had always been weak.

05:25.380 --> 05:26.460
Plus he has heart arrhythmia.

05:26.621 --> 05:27.820
Moments later, the mood turned violent.

05:27.981 --> 05:29.140
There are indications of cerebrovascular disease.

05:29.981 --> 05:31.221
I'm afraid

05:32.101 --> 05:34.380
I fear that this disease will be a crisis.

05:39.221 --> 05:40.140
Can it help?

05:42.820 --> 05:44.460
I'm not sure.

05:46.820 --> 05:47.500
Please take it away.

05:55.460 --> 05:56.101
Take it easy.

05:56.661 --> 05:57.700
You have to take it easy.

05:57.861 --> 05:58.661
Don't let it hit.

05:58.820 --> 06:00.061
If you hit it, you'll run out of air.

06:01.140 --> 06:03.221
Shi Chi Lang Shi Chi Lang

06:05.140 --> 06:05.940
Urgent report from Luoyang

06:08.500 --> 06:09.340
From the investigation of military scouts

06:09.820 --> 06:10.700
Cavalry under Duke Linzhi

06:10.861 --> 06:11.421
have abnormal movements

06:11.781 --> 06:12.981
A detachment of cavalry carried heavy crossbows.

06:13.260 --> 06:15.061
Leave the Luo River unknown trace

06:15.781 --> 06:16.380
incorrect

06:17.301 --> 06:19.301
One cavalry soldier carried a heavy crossbow.

06:19.781 --> 06:21.181
It's not like leaving Luoyang.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.101
More like an ambush.

06:22.700 --> 06:24.260
Who do they want to assassinate?

07:28.940 --> 07:29.421
Enemy attacks

07:29.741 --> 07:30.541
There's an enemy sneaking up on you.

08:02.981 --> 08:03.621
Sanlang

08:03.781 --> 08:05.781
This time swept them clean and there was nothing left.

08:07.380 --> 08:08.460
Cuilin

08:08.781 --> 08:10.020
I'll wait and see.

08:10.140 --> 08:11.741
This time you will still be alive.

08:11.900 --> 08:12.700
Survive or not?

09:41.580 --> 09:42.381
sir

09:49.740 --> 09:51.141
Chen thing

10:06.740 --> 10:07.700
Chen thing

10:14.860 --> 10:15.740
Ah Ying

10:17.541 --> 10:18.541
sir

10:28.661 --> 10:29.541
Ah Ying

11:25.781 --> 11:28.100
Ah-ying Ah-ying

11:29.860 --> 11:30.460
Please bear with me.

11:36.261 --> 11:36.820
How are you

11:53.541 --> 11:53.940
kill

11:54.421 --> 11:55.021
wade

11:55.620 --> 11:57.021
Can't go on.

11:57.141 --> 11:58.141
The Zhenxi army has arrived.

11:58.340 --> 11:59.021
It's Li.

11:59.181 --> 12:00.261
Li here came to help.

12:00.541 --> 12:01.421
what?

12:02.061 --> 12:03.061
Is it Li Ni again?

12:12.860 --> 12:13.421
sir

12:19.340 --> 12:19.781
go

12:40.700 --> 12:42.181
Let me take a look at Cui Lin and Zhao He.

12:42.261 --> 12:43.860
Or just run away?

12:44.541 --> 12:46.261
You shouldn't go looking for trouble with the Zhenxi Army.

12:46.580 --> 12:47.141
The person Li Ni sent

12:47.141 --> 12:48.381
They were all excellent soldiers.

12:48.740 --> 12:50.261
Even if we can borrow soldiers

12:50.381 --> 12:51.421
But it would be too damaging.

12:51.541 --> 12:52.901
We can't go and negotiate.

12:54.220 --> 12:54.901
Sanlang

12:55.061 --> 12:56.021
As long as there is life

12:56.141 --> 12:57.620
There must be hope.

13:10.301 --> 13:11.181
what happened

13:11.301 --> 13:12.381
Why did you bring her back?

13:12.620 --> 13:13.421
Hurry and call a military doctor.

13:13.541 --> 13:13.820
fast

13:14.541 --> 13:15.580
And are you injured or not?

13:28.340 --> 13:29.860
The arrowhead went in too deep.

13:29.980 --> 13:30.901
Plus it has thorns.

13:31.061 --> 13:32.421
If you pull it out violently

13:32.541 --> 13:33.700
I'm afraid it will hurt my meridians.

13:33.820 --> 13:35.021
And the blood will not stop flowing.

13:35.181 --> 13:35.421
now

13:35.580 --> 13:37.061
You can only pierce the arrow's head.
Come out carefully

13:37.220 --> 13:38.141
I'm old.

13:38.301 --> 13:39.901
Hands are not steady, not daring to pierce

13:40.421 --> 13:41.700
It's okay. I know medicine.

13:41.860 --> 13:42.301
Let me do it.

13:42.460 --> 13:44.661
But this method is very painful.

13:44.820 --> 13:47.460
I'm afraid that this little lady won't be able to stand it.

13:55.980 --> 13:56.501
Ah Ying

13:57.580 --> 13:58.580
The doctor said it would have to be drilled.

13:58.740 --> 13:59.501
Take out the arrowhead.

14:00.261 --> 14:01.100
It'll hurt a bit.

14:01.860 --> 14:02.781
Can you bear it?

14:05.700 --> 14:06.501
I'm there.

14:07.860 --> 14:09.301
You'll be fine.

14:31.220 --> 14:32.781
Mr. Kong, please endure the pain.

14:37.781 --> 14:38.381
Please bear with me.

14:38.781 --> 14:39.501
It'll be finished soon.

14:40.100 --> 14:41.181
It's almost there.

14:41.820 --> 14:43.580
Bite me, bite me

14:59.421 --> 15:00.301
nevermind

15:00.580 --> 15:01.620
It's okay now. It's okay.

15:02.141 --> 15:03.061
It's okay.

15:07.181 --> 15:07.860
It's okay now.

15:21.220 --> 15:22.261
Let me help you wipe it.

15:40.021 --> 15:42.301
The valley's terrain is very dangerous.

15:42.940 --> 15:43.261
Do you know?

15:43.381 --> 15:44.700
How many soldiers were the other side hiding?

15:45.220 --> 15:45.980
One more thing

15:46.181 --> 15:47.460
The other party held a heavy crossbow.

15:47.860 --> 15:49.141
You can survive.

15:49.381 --> 15:50.021
It is considered kindness.

15:50.181 --> 15:51.580
The greatness that heaven has for you

15:52.421 --> 15:53.340
Shi Chi Lang

15:53.700 --> 15:55.860
Polite people will stay away from danger.

16:00.781 --> 16:02.661
You are a good general.

16:03.261 --> 16:04.061
Why did you imitate?

16:04.220 --> 16:05.261
Your uncle died like that.

16:05.661 --> 16:06.820
Just refer to textbooks.

16:07.460 --> 16:09.021
Sit and discuss academics all day.

16:12.460 --> 16:14.021
Just now, we had just attacked Dan Tong.

16:14.541 --> 16:15.061
according to plan

16:15.220 --> 16:16.940
It was an important moment in retaking the capital.

16:17.301 --> 16:18.940
If you have an accident

16:19.100 --> 16:20.421
What will you have me do?

16:21.421 --> 16:22.340
One more thing

16:22.940 --> 16:23.901
The commander looked at that.

16:24.061 --> 16:25.460
She was a member of the Chui Family Army.

16:25.620 --> 16:26.141
You will risk your life.

16:26.301 --> 16:27.381
Why to help her?

16:27.740 --> 16:28.700
Who said I'm going to help?

16:28.820 --> 16:29.700
Mr. Kong He Kan

16:29.860 --> 16:30.381
You can't...

16:30.541 --> 16:31.901
I went to help Young Master Chui.

16:34.860 --> 16:35.940
Do you think I believe you?

16:36.261 --> 16:37.580
I think you believe

16:40.740 --> 16:41.141
okay

16:44.940 --> 16:46.061
Whatever you say is right.

16:59.740 --> 17:00.141
You guys

17:00.460 --> 17:00.820
No.

17:01.501 --> 17:02.661
You people, who are you?

17:05.380 --> 17:06.900
I couldn't imagine that Li Ni would dare to kill my younger brother.

17:07.061 --> 17:08.781
How dare he kill my salesman?

17:09.221 --> 17:10.620
Now I will kill you.

17:10.781 --> 17:12.340
To atone for my brother's life

17:13.820 --> 17:14.340
Hu Yin

17:14.501 --> 17:15.261
I never thought that your child

17:15.420 --> 17:16.541
Will you dare to kill my brother?

17:16.660 --> 17:17.820
Now I will kill you.

17:22.061 --> 17:23.860
Our men were able to stop Hu Yin Weiguo in time.

17:24.541 --> 17:26.301
The Royal Doctor also knew what to say.

17:26.380 --> 17:27.781
Her Majesty trusts

17:28.301 --> 17:30.021
The Viceroy arrived.

17:40.701 --> 17:42.380
Viceroy, please punish me for my inability.

17:42.541 --> 17:43.741
Prince Liang was too frightened.

17:43.900 --> 17:45.261
His original pulse was already weak.

17:45.420 --> 17:46.380
Especially now

17:47.221 --> 17:48.660
Just now, it was because of Hu Yin's anger.

17:48.820 --> 17:49.900
Can't breathe for a long time

17:49.900 --> 17:51.221
The heart nerve has broken.

17:51.221 --> 17:52.180
Medicine and stone needles are not effective.

17:52.380 --> 17:53.420
Has passed away, please.

17:58.221 --> 17:59.981
I, I want to cut off his head.

18:00.140 --> 18:01.420
and sent it to his son

18:01.580 --> 18:02.981
Let his son have a taste.

18:03.580 --> 18:05.301
What is it called?
Pain like stabbing thorns

18:14.340 --> 18:16.140
This person dies, no regrets.

18:17.061 --> 18:18.021
Turn off the news

18:18.180 --> 18:19.501
Take his bones and burn them.

18:19.820 --> 18:20.900
Destroy the bones.

18:21.301 --> 18:22.501
Revenge for Zheng Guogong

18:23.781 --> 18:24.420
no

18:25.261 --> 18:26.620
I want to cut off his head.

18:26.781 --> 18:27.781
and sent it to his son

18:31.261 --> 18:32.380
You hit me.

18:32.660 --> 18:34.900
I didn't think that he would slap me.

18:37.261 --> 18:38.900
Hu Yin Hu Yin

19:02.461 --> 19:03.301
What's wrong?

19:06.021 --> 19:07.301
Duke Liang is dead.

19:09.420 --> 19:10.261
what?

19:11.781 --> 19:12.420
Li Ni beheaded

19:12.580 --> 19:14.701
Zheng Guogong's and sent it back.

19:15.620 --> 19:17.900
Hu Yin Weiguo was so sad and angry that he couldn't stand it.

19:18.301 --> 19:19.580
Strangling Prince Liang to death

19:20.981 --> 19:22.900
Therefore, this news must be quickly suppressed.

19:23.541 --> 19:24.501
Can't let Li Ni know.

19:24.660 --> 19:26.180
that Prince Liang is dead

19:26.981 --> 19:29.140
I only know Hu Yin Weiguo.

19:29.301 --> 19:30.461
Stupid and messy

19:31.660 --> 19:32.820
Unthinkable

19:33.180 --> 19:35.380
That she would ruin my big plans.

19:38.061 --> 19:41.261
This Li Ni had an indomitable personality.

19:41.820 --> 19:43.100
clever and cunning

19:43.820 --> 19:45.301
Let Prince Liang still be alive.

19:45.900 --> 19:47.620
He didn't back down.

19:48.501 --> 19:51.660
Viceroy, don't get upset.

19:55.380 --> 19:56.741
Marry a virtuous wife

19:56.900 --> 19:58.660
I married the wrong wife.

19:59.261 --> 20:00.900
to lose Luo Yang

20:04.860 --> 20:06.180
Although this is the case

20:06.820 --> 20:08.620
Even if she makes another mistake

20:09.741 --> 20:10.620
Viceroy

20:11.261 --> 20:12.900
I never did anything to her.

20:13.620 --> 20:15.501
Probably the wife who shares the suffering

20:15.741 --> 20:18.061
In the end, it is something different in your mind.

20:21.021 --> 20:22.860
What are you again?

20:26.781 --> 20:29.100
She is your righteous wife.

20:30.380 --> 20:31.741
I just don't like her.

20:37.380 --> 20:39.380
You know that in my heart

20:39.860 --> 20:41.380
My wife is only you.

21:12.420 --> 21:13.180
Stop, stop, stop.

21:13.781 --> 21:14.420
It's here.

21:14.741 --> 21:15.701
Hurry and burn it.

21:15.981 --> 21:16.981
Ordered from above

21:17.140 --> 21:18.140
You have to break the bones and scatter them.

21:18.301 --> 21:18.941
Please, please.

21:23.420 --> 21:24.501
Why is this so creepy?

21:24.701 --> 21:25.461
yes

21:27.140 --> 21:27.860
under both feet

21:28.340 --> 21:29.420
When this coffin was buried

21:29.580 --> 21:30.541
Yin energy is very strong.

21:30.781 --> 21:31.941
Many people today in the palace

21:32.100 --> 21:33.221
Made a mistake and was dragged out.

21:33.420 --> 21:34.741
All were beaten to death alive.

21:35.100 --> 21:36.420
So the villagers rumoured.

21:36.580 --> 21:38.261
that there is a devil haunting

21:43.580 --> 21:44.021
underfoot

21:44.420 --> 21:45.701
The person who died today

21:45.900 --> 21:46.701
Wear beautiful robes

21:46.860 --> 21:48.301
There are many types of silk clothes on the body.

21:48.461 --> 21:49.301
Plus there are those shoes.

21:49.461 --> 21:50.781
Looking at it, I knew that it was very rich.

21:51.100 --> 21:51.900
You look.

21:52.180 --> 21:53.021
instead of burning it

21:53.140 --> 21:54.820
It's better not to sell it to us for money.

21:55.061 --> 21:56.620
Do you guys dare to make money even from dead people?

21:57.301 --> 21:58.781
No wonder there are people always spending money.

21:58.941 --> 21:59.541
wise

21:59.701 --> 22:00.620
I really want this job.

22:02.380 --> 22:02.860
okay

22:03.180 --> 22:04.100
You guys make it a little nimble.

22:04.380 --> 22:05.021
yes

22:05.180 --> 22:05.941
Above has told me.

22:06.140 --> 22:06.820
that he must be seen by us

22:06.981 --> 22:07.981
burned to ashes with eyes

22:08.781 --> 22:09.420
Both of you are invited.

22:11.620 --> 22:12.820
Hurry and change.

22:13.180 --> 22:13.541
can

22:30.620 --> 22:31.580
Hurry, hurry.

22:32.420 --> 22:32.941
Hurry and walk.

22:33.461 --> 22:33.860
Hurry up.

22:34.221 --> 22:35.221
Hurry and walk.

22:54.021 --> 22:54.461
His Majesty

22:58.620 --> 23:00.620
Has your body gotten better?

23:07.660 --> 23:11.301
I'm not the eldest child. If you kill your father

23:11.981 --> 23:14.420
I must thank you for being emperor.

23:15.221 --> 23:16.620
Is this what you wrote?

23:18.380 --> 23:18.900
yes

23:21.420 --> 23:21.900
His Majesty

23:23.340 --> 23:24.541
You ungrateful son.

23:25.380 --> 23:27.261
You are an ungrateful son.

23:28.580 --> 23:31.541
Are you really going to kill your father?

23:32.140 --> 23:34.100
Viceroy Sun was so cruel.

23:34.261 --> 23:35.620
You still want to be emperor.

23:35.781 --> 23:37.660
You really want to kill me.

23:38.620 --> 23:39.261
His Majesty

23:39.660 --> 23:40.380
That was just a plan.

23:40.580 --> 23:41.860
Just provoke Sun Jing.

23:42.501 --> 23:44.140
in order to help His Majesty come out

23:49.100 --> 23:50.461
Help me out.

23:56.340 --> 23:57.380
Where is this?

23:58.021 --> 23:59.061
This is Dan Tong.

24:00.301 --> 24:01.741
After Sun Jing rebelled,

24:02.301 --> 24:02.660
Father also

24:02.781 --> 24:04.221
locked up as a hostage
I've always been in the capital.

24:05.380 --> 24:06.061
I'm always planning.

24:06.221 --> 24:07.620
How to help Father come out

24:08.221 --> 24:08.860
previous

24:09.620 --> 24:10.180
Arrange manpower secretly

24:10.301 --> 24:11.501
in the palace

24:11.820 --> 24:12.820
through the Chui Sakul Army

24:13.820 --> 24:15.061
Just wait when the opportunity arises to take action.

24:19.021 --> 24:20.941
Well, when the opportunity arose, I took action.

24:21.140 --> 24:22.541
Plan to act when your opportunity arises.

24:22.701 --> 24:24.301
is to send an ungrateful letter

24:24.461 --> 24:26.100
Are you going to give it to Sun Jing?

24:26.380 --> 24:27.501
You know.

24:28.541 --> 24:30.301
If Sun Jing changed his mind just a little,

24:30.461 --> 24:32.461
I'd probably have my head cut off.

24:37.420 --> 24:37.981
His Majesty

24:38.380 --> 24:40.140
I know that after you saw the letter

24:40.461 --> 24:41.820
Must be extremely angry

24:42.461 --> 24:43.820
Your body has always been bad.

24:44.221 --> 24:45.340
Often dizzy

24:45.941 --> 24:47.140
I want you to be very angry.

24:47.380 --> 24:48.660
You will immediately faint.

24:49.261 --> 24:50.941
I ordered the drug user to fake death.

24:51.340 --> 24:53.261
Makes his father look like he's dead.
to fool Sun Jing

24:54.061 --> 24:55.140
Waiting for the body to be put in the coffin

24:55.701 --> 24:56.900
Let the lily tree die instead of the peach tree.

24:57.301 --> 24:58.420
Then help Father come out.

25:03.860 --> 25:05.100
You are ungrateful.

25:05.781 --> 25:07.380
You are an ungrateful son.

25:07.701 --> 25:09.380
You act rashly and without thinking.

25:10.461 --> 25:11.541
You are taking your life.

25:11.741 --> 25:12.541
of the father at birth

25:12.701 --> 25:14.261
Become a bet, did you know?

25:15.941 --> 25:16.620
I don't dare.

25:16.781 --> 25:18.580
What else do you not dare to do?

25:24.741 --> 25:26.261
I saw your face and I was angry.

25:29.741 --> 25:30.140
Get over it.

25:30.701 --> 25:31.380
Hurry and get rid of your head.

25:35.021 --> 25:37.301
Yes, my child asks for leave.

25:37.741 --> 25:39.301
Waiting for Father to stop being angry.

25:40.100 --> 25:40.981
I will come to visit you again.

25:42.221 --> 25:43.021
Hurry and get rid of your head.

26:15.701 --> 26:16.741
Saluting the general

26:17.501 --> 26:19.221
I heard that Prince Liang has returned.

26:19.340 --> 26:21.100
So I stewed a cup of chicken curry with pine mushrooms.

26:21.301 --> 26:22.340
Scoop out the oil.

26:22.501 --> 26:23.660
Make it a clear soup.

26:24.021 --> 26:24.900
I think Prince Liang

26:25.061 --> 26:27.180
Going through hardships Tired both physically and mentally

26:27.340 --> 26:29.261
Eat light, nourishing food.

26:29.420 --> 26:30.820
Can restore breath

26:31.100 --> 26:32.100
Grandson probably doesn't know.

26:32.261 --> 26:32.820
Our young lady

26:32.981 --> 26:34.100
Watch over the stove by yourself.

26:34.301 --> 26:35.620
Stewed for many hours

26:35.781 --> 26:37.061
Qiu Shui had already said too much.

26:38.701 --> 26:39.860
It's difficult for you to get a loan.

26:40.340 --> 26:41.620
What are these words, General?

26:41.741 --> 26:43.380
The general is a person who has to do big things.

26:43.541 --> 26:44.660
Busy with military activities

26:44.900 --> 26:46.541
Sow Wattle is incompetent.

26:46.741 --> 26:47.981
And still a weak woman

26:48.180 --> 26:50.221
Adding to the suffering of the army

26:50.781 --> 26:52.461
Since Prince Liang has returned

26:52.620 --> 26:54.660
I asked the general to allow me to sow the wattles and take care of him.

26:54.860 --> 26:56.380
Prince Liang's clothes and food.

27:00.981 --> 27:01.860
this

27:02.620 --> 27:03.981
It's better not to disturb Mr. Noo Loan.

27:04.781 --> 27:06.140
His father had just been rescued.

27:06.701 --> 27:07.860
My mind is still not stable.

27:08.380 --> 27:10.701
Mood The mood was not good.

27:10.820 --> 27:12.380
General, don't worry.

27:12.660 --> 27:13.701
Sow wattles at home

27:13.900 --> 27:15.180
I used to take care of the elderly.

27:15.380 --> 27:16.461
I know that my body is not good.

27:16.660 --> 27:17.620
suffering from illness

27:17.820 --> 27:19.501
It's normal to be in a bad mood.

27:19.981 --> 27:21.140
Commander, please rest assured.

27:21.301 --> 27:22.261
Wan Niang will take care of Prince Liang.

27:22.420 --> 27:23.461
Definitely very good

27:23.701 --> 27:24.340
Yes, sir.

27:24.501 --> 27:25.781
Our young lady is a detailed person.

27:25.981 --> 27:27.340
At that time our master was sick.

27:27.501 --> 27:28.900
All of them are women who help take care of him.

27:29.900 --> 27:30.981
Ask the general

27:31.140 --> 27:32.981
You can use it to sow wattles.
What little abilities do you have?

27:37.301 --> 27:38.620
Like that, it's bothering you already.

27:54.620 --> 27:55.340
Lady Taozi

28:01.860 --> 28:03.140
Has your wound gotten better?

28:04.100 --> 28:05.301
It's not a big deal.

28:05.461 --> 28:06.900
At most, it only hurt for a few days.

28:08.021 --> 28:09.781
You must be hungry. Let's eat something.

28:11.140 --> 28:11.501
come

28:12.701 --> 28:13.340
can

28:20.501 --> 28:21.981
What's the matter? Aren't the noodles delicious?

28:24.180 --> 28:26.301
How can water noodles be more delicious than pig ears?

28:30.420 --> 28:31.420
What are you laughing at?

28:31.660 --> 28:32.781
There's nothing.

28:32.941 --> 28:34.340
Mee is almost cold. You hurry up and eat.

28:42.040 --> 28:45.120
(General's quarters)

29:54.340 --> 29:55.900
What are you doing secretly?

29:56.140 --> 29:56.900
Do you want to secretly kiss me?

30:04.900 --> 30:06.820
Do you have anything worthy of me secretly kissing?

30:09.701 --> 30:10.660
This one.

30:11.061 --> 30:12.501
I saved your life.

30:12.941 --> 30:13.860
You think I helped you.

30:13.941 --> 30:14.741
How many times?

30:15.340 --> 30:15.860
You act inconsiderate.

30:15.941 --> 30:17.061
A benefactor who saved your life like this?

30:18.380 --> 30:19.741
Grandson trusts

30:20.100 --> 30:22.380
What day will you be in danger?

30:22.820 --> 30:24.461
I must eliminate all difficulties.

30:24.580 --> 30:26.301
Break through the thorns to help you.

30:27.781 --> 30:30.221
Polite people keep the truth. How delighted

30:37.541 --> 30:38.180
How do you know?

30:38.261 --> 30:39.701
That someone wants to secretly attack us.

30:41.701 --> 30:42.420
I know Luoyang

30:42.541 --> 30:43.941
Send out some troops.

30:44.340 --> 30:45.981
And this force held the crossbow.

30:46.420 --> 30:48.140
Clearly wanted to assassinate

30:49.021 --> 30:50.140
I thought about it.

30:50.541 --> 30:51.820
I suddenly thought of your Chui clan army.

30:51.820 --> 30:52.501
That Chui Li

30:52.860 --> 30:54.501
He had come to discuss with Pei Yuan.

30:54.900 --> 30:56.301
will secretly attack Khun Chai Chui

30:57.340 --> 30:57.941
I think

30:58.061 --> 30:58.941
That Chui Li probably wouldn't.

30:58.941 --> 31:00.140
Go do it with someone else.

31:00.741 --> 31:01.981
But go do it with Mr. Chui

31:04.981 --> 31:07.860
Yes, Chui Li.

31:08.380 --> 31:09.580
It must be him.

31:12.541 --> 31:13.061
And I don't know.

31:13.180 --> 31:14.380
What method does he use?

31:15.261 --> 31:16.380
that can give the people of Luoyang

31:16.501 --> 31:17.580
Let him borrow your troops.

31:18.301 --> 31:20.100
Since Chui Li wanted to kill Young Master Chui

31:20.461 --> 31:21.781
So you have to find someone.

31:22.061 --> 31:23.741
Let's blame him for the murder.

31:24.340 --> 31:25.340
During this time, I am at Dan Tong.

31:25.660 --> 31:27.021
and was the commander of the Zhenxi Army.

31:27.541 --> 31:29.021
Not the best option

31:30.620 --> 31:31.340
expected

31:31.501 --> 31:32.860
He probably used this method.

31:33.140 --> 31:34.860
Go convince my elder brother to borrow some troops.

31:36.820 --> 31:38.021
Your big brother?

31:38.860 --> 31:40.420
I couldn't imagine that they would do this.

31:41.580 --> 31:43.180
They are stupid and fuzzy.

31:44.180 --> 31:45.620
It's normal to be easily deceived by people.

31:49.100 --> 31:50.941
The world is like this.

31:53.541 --> 31:54.420
Chui Li was just

31:54.501 --> 31:55.820
Cousin of
Aren't you all sirs?

31:56.461 --> 31:58.140
It is a quarrel between siblings.

32:08.221 --> 32:08.900
It's definitely not good.

32:09.781 --> 32:11.420
Things in Yingzhou must have secrets.

32:12.660 --> 32:14.781
What about you, sir? What about Taozi?

32:15.301 --> 32:16.420
Are they injured?

32:16.981 --> 32:18.301
And where is my horse?

32:19.580 --> 32:19.820
You probably can't.

32:19.941 --> 32:21.180
I'll hurry back to Yingzhou now.

32:22.180 --> 32:23.261
I'm worried.

32:25.741 --> 32:26.340
Yingzhou is

32:26.420 --> 32:27.580
The base of our Chui clan army.

32:28.781 --> 32:29.620
Not working

32:30.420 --> 32:31.941
I'll have to think of a way to hurry back.

32:34.140 --> 32:34.660
Ah Ying

32:35.180 --> 32:36.380
Your injuries are not fatal.

32:36.781 --> 32:37.900
But your gentleman

32:38.180 --> 32:39.021
May need to be rehabilitated well

32:39.180 --> 32:40.021
It's been several days.

32:40.981 --> 32:42.420
If you insist on rushing back

32:42.781 --> 32:43.380
I will not hinder you.

32:43.981 --> 32:45.100
But you must think carefully.

32:45.660 --> 32:46.140
that you can

32:46.261 --> 32:47.501
endured until meeting a large army

32:48.021 --> 32:49.100
And there's still strength left.

32:49.180 --> 32:50.501
Go help Ying Zhou again or not?

32:57.741 --> 32:58.580
Don't hurry.

32:59.420 --> 33:00.420
The matter has reached this stage.

33:01.140 --> 33:02.261
Don't fight us, let's think.

33:02.541 --> 33:03.541
Is there any other way?

33:20.140 --> 33:20.620
sir

33:23.140 --> 33:24.100
Sir, you have recovered.

33:29.461 --> 33:30.261
What about Aing?

33:31.261 --> 33:31.941
Khun Chai trusts

33:32.140 --> 33:32.981
The captain is fine.

33:33.340 --> 33:34.541
Only minor injuries

33:34.701 --> 33:35.420
It's not a big deal.

33:36.301 --> 33:37.140
Then that's good.

33:39.261 --> 33:40.221
Ah, what?

33:44.501 --> 33:45.221
Ah, what?

33:46.501 --> 33:46.941
sir

33:48.941 --> 33:49.981
Ah, things are gone.

33:54.820 --> 33:55.380
sir

33:56.261 --> 33:57.140
Don't be sad.

33:58.140 --> 33:58.660
protect sir

33:58.781 --> 33:59.741
It's our duty.

34:01.021 --> 34:01.941
But now

34:04.941 --> 34:06.061
Ah, things no longer exist.

34:09.381 --> 34:10.861
Ah, things really no longer exist.

34:11.660 --> 34:12.220
sir

34:13.100 --> 34:14.700
Ah, things I probably didn't want.
This gentleman is sad like this.

34:15.541 --> 34:16.421
Me and Uncle Thing

34:17.941 --> 34:19.580
They were all orphans that no one wanted.

34:20.620 --> 34:21.501
If you don't have Mr.

34:21.501 --> 34:22.461
with the captain who received us

34:22.740 --> 34:23.981
Let us be in the Chui clan army.

34:24.341 --> 34:25.981
And where is there for us to live?

34:27.180 --> 34:28.300
I died for you.

34:28.901 --> 34:30.061
Ah, definitely no regrets.

34:30.861 --> 34:31.861
I don't regret it either.

34:31.981 --> 34:33.260
I cannot allow you to say these words.

34:39.180 --> 34:40.501
Where is this?

34:41.501 --> 34:42.100
Dan Tong

34:42.501 --> 34:43.461
Zhenxi army camp

34:43.740 --> 34:44.501
He is Dali's grandson.

34:46.740 --> 34:48.740
Yes, it was him who brought us back.

34:53.300 --> 34:54.180
Li Ni

34:54.901 --> 34:55.421
sir

34:55.901 --> 34:56.981
You should rest first.

34:57.861 --> 34:59.461
Just now, Tao Zi came to take the young man's pulse.

34:59.740 --> 35:00.700
Military doctor of the Zhenxi army

35:00.821 --> 35:01.780
I came to see your condition.

35:02.421 --> 35:03.620
Said that the young man was seriously injured.

35:03.700 --> 35:04.580
Must rest a lot.

35:06.861 --> 35:07.220
no

35:08.700 --> 35:09.700
I can't stay here.

35:09.821 --> 35:10.260
sir

35:10.580 --> 35:11.501
Urgent matters change according to the situation.

35:11.821 --> 35:12.660
We have to recover well first.

35:12.780 --> 35:13.660
Plan again

35:14.180 --> 35:15.901
This place was still thousands of li away from Yingzhou.

35:16.861 --> 35:17.981
If a man doesn't take care of himself well

35:18.660 --> 35:19.740
That's destruction.

35:20.300 --> 35:21.341
Placing all our pieces

35:26.501 --> 35:27.580
There is another matter.

35:30.461 --> 35:31.180
Chen thing

35:32.061 --> 35:32.981
And the soldiers who fought to the death

35:33.061 --> 35:34.381
of the Chui Sakul Army

35:36.220 --> 35:38.901
Please disturb my grandson and send someone to help me.

35:39.780 --> 35:41.421
bury them

35:43.821 --> 35:44.620
You trust me.

35:45.300 --> 35:46.381
When you still haven't recovered

35:46.780 --> 35:47.660
I've sent someone to collect the corpse.

35:47.780 --> 35:49.180
A soldier from the Chui army who fought until the death.

35:50.381 --> 35:51.220
I know that Chen things

35:51.421 --> 35:53.061
Be the bodyguard at your prince's side.

35:53.660 --> 35:54.981
I've ordered people to go make spirit signs.

35:56.620 --> 35:58.021
Waiting for Mr. Chui to recover well.

35:58.461 --> 35:59.620
Gradually go and pay homage by yourself.

36:00.821 --> 36:03.021
Aing, I'm sorry.

36:07.220 --> 36:07.861
thank you

36:12.660 --> 36:13.421
come

36:14.180 --> 36:15.140
When recovered

36:15.461 --> 36:16.541
You should be able to take medicine.

36:16.740 --> 36:18.021
Taozi ordered me repeatedly.

36:18.260 --> 36:19.821
Let me keep an eye on you taking medicine.

36:19.981 --> 36:21.021
In order to prevent the wound from becoming pus-filled

36:22.341 --> 36:23.341
Very bitter

36:46.260 --> 36:46.901
Lady Taozi

36:47.180 --> 36:48.061
I'm about to go find you.

36:48.381 --> 36:49.300
What a coincidence!

36:49.421 --> 36:50.780
I'm about to go find it as well.

36:51.180 --> 36:52.300
What is the matter with you?

36:53.501 --> 36:54.180
This is a painkiller.

36:54.300 --> 36:54.981
that I found for you

36:55.100 --> 36:56.021
You used it to put on wounds.

36:56.100 --> 36:57.341
This way, you won't get hurt anymore.

37:03.140 --> 37:04.021
fool

37:04.300 --> 37:04.821
Have you forgotten?

37:04.901 --> 37:05.941
that I can administer the medicine myself

37:06.461 --> 37:07.941
I definitely haven't forgotten.

37:08.140 --> 37:08.981
just

37:09.061 --> 37:10.501
I'm just afraid that if you don't exist,

37:10.861 --> 37:11.861
Last time you said

37:11.981 --> 37:13.501
Aren't your wounds going to hurt for many days?

37:14.381 --> 37:16.100
Yes, then I will accept it.

37:16.260 --> 37:16.981
Thank you very much.

37:19.620 --> 37:20.421
What is the matter with you?

37:21.140 --> 37:21.740
I'm looking for you.

37:21.861 --> 37:23.341
Because I want you to help me.

37:23.901 --> 37:24.780
What do you want me to do for you?

37:24.941 --> 37:25.260
just tell

37:25.421 --> 37:25.941
I'll definitely help.

37:26.461 --> 37:28.260
Do you guys have any sugar?

37:28.421 --> 37:29.180
If it were honey

37:29.260 --> 37:30.461
It'll be even better.

37:31.421 --> 37:32.941
sugar or

37:33.061 --> 37:34.100
We fight and fight.

37:34.300 --> 37:34.780
in the kitchen

37:34.901 --> 37:35.740
How can there be sugar?

37:35.941 --> 37:37.021
No need to mention honey at all.

37:37.740 --> 37:38.700
What do you want sugar for?

37:39.541 --> 37:40.740
our captain

37:40.861 --> 37:41.740
Since I was little, after taking medicine

37:41.901 --> 37:42.861
I won't eat rice.

37:43.021 --> 37:44.861
At that time, if there was sugar

37:45.021 --> 37:45.501
After taking the medicine

37:45.541 --> 37:46.780
Give her sweet water to drink.

37:46.901 --> 37:48.260
She's going to eat rice.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.821
But there's no market nearby.

37:50.941 --> 37:52.021
There is nowhere to buy.

38:03.341 --> 38:05.381
Prince Liang had reached Dan Tong safely.

38:05.981 --> 38:08.501
Hopefully the grandson and heir to the throne will be able to
Change bad things into good things.

38:09.140 --> 38:10.300
Free from misfortune

38:11.300 --> 38:12.140
Her Majesty trusts

38:12.381 --> 38:13.941
The grandson and heir to the throne must be safe.

38:17.381 --> 38:19.260
Li Ni had captured Dan Tong.

38:19.901 --> 38:21.700
It is expected that Sun Jing

38:21.700 --> 38:22.780
The mind must be distraught.

38:23.180 --> 38:23.821
You look.

38:24.140 --> 38:25.941
Today he had orders to harvest rice.

38:26.260 --> 38:27.660
to the people in the city

38:27.861 --> 38:28.780
Every family hoards

38:28.901 --> 38:30.780
enough food to eat for three months

38:31.180 --> 38:33.620
Sun Jing seemed to be preparing.

38:33.821 --> 38:35.341
For being surrounded

38:36.061 --> 38:37.180
Thus, the seventeen grandchildren

38:37.341 --> 38:38.700
Will he lead an army to surround the city?

38:42.061 --> 38:44.260
Xichang City had a strong moat.

38:44.421 --> 38:45.580
Easy to defend but difficult to attack.

38:46.180 --> 38:48.100
Li Ni would definitely not force his way in.

38:48.821 --> 38:49.821
hope

39:00.901 --> 39:01.700
Before Sun Jing

39:01.861 --> 39:03.740
will call back the great army

39:04.421 --> 39:06.541
Li Ni would be able to save Xichang City.

39:18.220 --> 39:19.140
Where have you gone and what have you done?

39:19.260 --> 39:20.300
I didn't even eat lunch.

39:20.461 --> 39:21.700
I just went for a walk on the mountain.

39:25.821 --> 39:26.501
Shi Chi Lang

39:26.821 --> 39:28.660
You are now a commander.
of the Zhenxi Army

39:28.780 --> 39:29.981
No matter what you do

39:30.100 --> 39:31.541
This cannot be done arbitrarily.

39:32.100 --> 39:32.780
Just like this time

39:33.180 --> 39:35.341
You didn't care about the danger and went to help General He.

39:36.140 --> 39:37.821
Captain He is clever and cunning.

39:37.981 --> 39:39.620
and was extremely loyal to Cuilin.

39:40.021 --> 39:41.901
A person like this will become a person sooner or later.

39:42.061 --> 39:43.341
It's definitely our downfall.

39:43.941 --> 39:44.861
I think

39:45.901 --> 39:47.461
She was more loyal to Cui Yi.

39:49.140 --> 39:49.901
Do you think that

39:50.021 --> 39:51.220
Between her and Mr. Chui

39:51.660 --> 39:52.541
How strange is that?

39:52.901 --> 39:53.740
What's strange?

39:54.341 --> 39:55.901
That Captain He was loyal to Chui Lin.

39:55.941 --> 39:56.700
Or is he loyal to Cui Yi?

39:56.821 --> 39:57.501
It's the same.

39:57.660 --> 39:59.100
Father and son are like the same person.

40:01.300 --> 40:02.981
There are words that I shouldn't say.

40:04.861 --> 40:05.341
But if

40:05.461 --> 40:06.620
I'm not talking to you.

40:06.740 --> 40:08.140
No one is talking to you anymore.

40:08.941 --> 40:10.660
Passionate, intoxicated, insane

40:10.821 --> 40:12.501
It is not the act of a polite person.

40:13.220 --> 40:13.941
You've misunderstood.

40:14.061 --> 40:15.140
It's not what you think.

40:16.660 --> 40:18.300
Shi Qi Lang, you look.

40:18.421 --> 40:19.501
I'm prepared.

40:20.821 --> 40:21.541
I'll come back and talk to you soon.

40:22.941 --> 40:23.821
Where are you going?

40:24.061 --> 40:25.220
I won't tell you.
