01:33.400 --> 01:37.840
Today's show of sympathy is about to begin.

01:40.079 --> 01:41.519
Soldiers of the Empire

01:41.840 --> 01:44.599
for the great cause of East Asia's co-prosperity,

01:44.599 --> 01:48.959
for your participation in the Holy War,

01:48.959 --> 01:50.519
on behalf of all the officers and men,

01:50.519 --> 01:52.920
on behalf of all the officers and soldiers.

01:52.920 --> 01:53.680
Applause.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.680
For the empire.

02:02.400 --> 02:03.239
What about

02:04.040 --> 02:04.920
I still can't make it.

02:07.840 --> 02:09.639
When are you going to give me the key?

02:10.879 --> 02:11.840
To be honest,

02:11.840 --> 02:13.159
when you were not here,

02:13.599 --> 02:15.120
I've looked through the entire house.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.599
I really want to know

02:18.240 --> 02:20.080
where you hid the key now.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.560
You haven't opened my book, have you?

02:23.560 --> 02:24.560
You are a traitor!

02:24.560 --> 02:25.520
I am not.

02:25.520 --> 02:26.639
It's from Japan.

02:35.520 --> 02:37.000
And the one in your hand,

02:38.439 --> 02:39.800
there are seven keys in total.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.479
The Wave dance begins.

03:06.960 --> 03:08.159
Of the First Ranking.

03:08.159 --> 03:09.080
What do you mean?

03:09.479 --> 03:10.080
What do I mean?

03:10.080 --> 03:10.919
Hurry up.

03:15.560 --> 03:16.240
Hurry up.

03:36.039 --> 03:37.000
A little lower.

03:40.719 --> 03:41.879
Move down a bit.

03:52.919 --> 03:54.360
To the right.

04:07.840 --> 04:08.879
Hurry up!

04:16.680 --> 04:17.759
Take it back!

04:17.800 --> 04:18.519
What's up

04:18.519 --> 04:19.439
put it back.

05:18.800 --> 05:19.639
Where's the key?

05:29.680 --> 05:30.560
Shine the light on it.

05:37.040 --> 05:37.879
A little forward.

05:45.839 --> 05:46.680
Watch out!

05:46.680 --> 05:47.680
To the left.

05:55.879 --> 05:56.519
Give it to me.

06:19.839 --> 06:20.199
Come on.

06:20.439 --> 06:21.759
This is the last chance.

06:33.199 --> 06:33.839
It's coming!

06:40.759 --> 06:41.399
To the right.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.480
This is the second key.

07:52.240 --> 07:54.040
Commander Shanxia is anxious to see me.

07:54.120 --> 07:55.319
What is it?

07:55.879 --> 07:57.959
According to Jiang Zhaoguo's information,

07:57.959 --> 07:58.800
we contacted

07:58.800 --> 08:00.279
the spy in Communist Zone.

08:00.439 --> 08:02.600
Verified that an alias Li Yupu

08:02.600 --> 08:04.839
who was involved in the design and printing of the currency.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.319
He absconded a while ago.

08:23.399 --> 08:24.519
Look at this.

08:25.079 --> 08:25.920
This photo is of

08:28.519 --> 08:33.200
this is an surveillance video of

08:33.200 --> 08:35.240
who lurked in Yan'an Communist Zone

08:35.480 --> 08:37.360
after his identity was exposed,

08:37.679 --> 08:40.639
he stole the copper engraving in the border area

08:41.080 --> 08:42.279
I think I've seen this person recently.

08:42.679 --> 08:44.000
He looks familiar.

08:44.720 --> 08:46.519
You met him?

08:46.799 --> 08:47.600
I remember that

08:47.919 --> 08:49.120
we have caught this person.

08:49.679 --> 08:50.840
He is currently detained

08:50.840 --> 08:53.120
of Military Police Headquarters.

08:54.759 --> 08:55.480
Really?

09:35.679 --> 09:36.480
To make it through.

09:45.360 --> 09:46.639
Now we have to fight.

09:47.080 --> 09:47.679
Rush there!

09:48.320 --> 09:48.879
Don't take the risk!

09:49.440 --> 09:50.440
Let me think.

09:50.440 --> 09:52.399
What for? We have no time.

09:52.679 --> 09:53.679
If you don't leave, I will.

09:53.679 --> 09:55.080
It's almost over. Give me the key.

09:56.080 --> 09:56.919
Give me the key.

11:19.559 --> 11:20.519
Wang Dapu.

11:20.720 --> 11:21.600
Wang Dapu?

12:22.679 --> 12:24.440
How did you know about Dayan?

12:25.360 --> 12:26.080
It's me.

12:26.799 --> 12:27.679
I was...

12:28.840 --> 12:29.720
I heard it from...

12:30.360 --> 12:31.320
From Manager Luo.

12:32.320 --> 12:33.840
How did you know

12:33.840 --> 12:35.399
wang Dapu is Dayan's?

12:36.559 --> 12:37.639
I saw him making the key

12:38.240 --> 12:39.519
In the cell.

12:39.840 --> 12:41.320
This is extremely exquisite.

12:42.120 --> 12:43.440
I heard that

12:43.440 --> 12:44.799
dayan was a bronze carver.

12:45.279 --> 12:46.279
So I guessed

12:46.279 --> 12:48.440
wang Dapu could be Dayan.

12:49.480 --> 12:50.759
In that case,

12:51.039 --> 12:52.840
why didn't you report it to us?

12:53.200 --> 12:54.399
Officer Uchida.

12:54.399 --> 12:56.159
If I report to you,

12:56.159 --> 12:58.559
he will be arrested and interrogated for several times.

12:58.559 --> 13:00.519
But he will keep his mouth shut.

13:01.080 --> 13:01.559
However,

13:01.759 --> 13:02.519
I was thinking...

13:02.519 --> 13:04.120
If I escape with him,

13:04.879 --> 13:07.000
I might be able to find the copper plate.

13:08.480 --> 13:10.879
You think I'll believe you?

13:11.679 --> 13:14.279
The five of hearts

13:14.679 --> 13:16.080
are a team, aren't they?

13:16.080 --> 13:17.000
Officer Uchida.

13:17.360 --> 13:19.200
I'm really not the Five of Hearts.

13:19.200 --> 13:20.519
If I can find the copper plate this time,

13:20.519 --> 13:22.039
to prove my innocence.

13:22.320 --> 13:24.399
Uchida Officer, please trust me.

13:25.679 --> 13:28.240
But Wang Dapu doesn't trust you.

13:28.879 --> 13:29.679
He ran away.

13:30.879 --> 13:31.960
To trap you here.

13:33.879 --> 13:34.840
Officer Uchida.

13:35.639 --> 13:36.720
Think about it.

13:37.200 --> 13:38.960
If Wang Dapu is really

13:38.960 --> 13:40.320
with Wang Dapu,

13:40.320 --> 13:42.360
how could he leave me behind?

13:44.519 --> 13:46.159
Wang Dapu is now gone,

13:47.399 --> 13:49.039
you can't get close to him anymore.

13:51.759 --> 13:52.759
I can find him.

13:55.200 --> 13:55.759
Is that so?

13:57.759 --> 13:58.600
On Mai Yang Road,

13:58.960 --> 14:01.600
an abandoned oil factory on Mai Yang Road

14:02.879 --> 14:03.600
why?

14:04.000 --> 14:05.320
After he was locked up,

14:05.320 --> 14:07.200
the only time he left the detention center

14:07.200 --> 14:09.279
was to work at the oil factory

14:09.720 --> 14:11.159
he knows the environment

14:11.159 --> 14:13.039
and he's very familiar with the environment.

14:13.399 --> 14:16.879
The Gendarmes are looking for him

14:17.600 --> 14:18.360
I think

14:19.200 --> 14:20.960
he must be hiding there.

14:23.519 --> 14:24.480
Officer in the third.

14:25.120 --> 14:28.240
I will find the copper plate.

14:28.240 --> 14:29.600
Please trust me.

14:30.039 --> 14:30.919
Please trust me.

14:37.000 --> 14:37.320
Alright.

14:38.919 --> 14:40.320
I'll give you this opportunity.

14:41.639 --> 14:43.240
Thank you, Officer Ueda.

14:52.480 --> 14:53.919
Chen Jiaping is dead.

15:01.240 --> 15:01.720
That's impossible.

15:01.720 --> 15:02.639
Officer Uchida.

15:02.639 --> 15:04.360
Is that a joke?

15:05.240 --> 15:06.720
Why would I?

15:09.799 --> 15:10.879
How did he die?

15:12.480 --> 15:13.399
Who killed him?

15:16.679 --> 15:18.240
I killed him myself.

15:20.759 --> 15:22.240
Why did you kill him?

15:22.759 --> 15:24.559
He escaped from prison with a criminal.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.480
And were caught on the spot.

15:27.159 --> 15:28.240
Prison break?

15:31.720 --> 15:32.799
Why is that?

15:34.759 --> 15:35.720
Officer Uchida.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.159
We found her.

15:37.159 --> 15:38.600
Five of hearts is Zhao An.

15:39.279 --> 15:40.720
Chen Jia Ping is innocent,

15:42.360 --> 15:43.559
are you blaming me

15:43.919 --> 15:45.039
for killing innocent people?

15:45.720 --> 15:46.799
I didn't mean that.

15:50.720 --> 15:52.279
That boy is to blame.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.120
He was unlucky.

16:03.639 --> 16:05.159
You are anxious to see Director Jiang?

16:05.759 --> 16:06.799
What exactly is it?

16:08.759 --> 16:09.879
Something important?

16:33.480 --> 16:34.480
Where's Director Jiang?

16:35.000 --> 16:36.080
He is having a meeting inside.

16:53.600 --> 16:54.559
Please.

16:58.360 --> 17:00.600
We haven't contacted Dayan for a long time.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.799
If we contact him rashly,

17:02.799 --> 17:04.400
when we contact him, right?

17:06.359 --> 17:08.319
Do you think that

17:09.640 --> 17:11.200
to the wild goose?

17:11.200 --> 17:13.759
We might run into those who come from Yan'an.

17:14.240 --> 17:15.599
Or caught by the Japanese.

17:15.599 --> 17:16.680
It's all possible.

17:34.400 --> 17:35.839
I heard you wanted to see me.

17:42.559 --> 17:43.599
Left Shuangtao, what are you doing?

17:43.920 --> 17:44.960
Drop the gun!

17:48.000 --> 17:49.119
Put it down!

17:49.119 --> 17:50.759
Why did you do this?

17:51.480 --> 17:51.839
Left Twin Peach.

17:51.839 --> 17:52.960
Do you know what you're doing?

17:53.200 --> 17:54.519
Put the gun down!

17:55.039 --> 17:57.079
Why you want to frame Chen Jia Ping?

17:57.440 --> 17:59.200
I framed Chen Jia Ping?

17:59.440 --> 18:01.839
Didn't you know it was to protect you?

18:02.119 --> 18:02.880
However,

18:03.400 --> 18:05.160
chen Jia Ping died.

18:06.480 --> 18:07.680
Chen Family Ping died?

18:08.000 --> 18:09.599
He was killed by you.

18:10.160 --> 18:11.599
Chen Jiaping is dead?

18:12.440 --> 18:14.519
That a traitor might die,

18:15.079 --> 18:17.640
or a hidden CCP is dead.

18:17.960 --> 18:19.480
Do you have to be that sad?

18:22.960 --> 18:24.000
Director Jiang,

18:26.240 --> 18:28.400
don't you have anyone you love?

18:30.519 --> 18:32.000
Have you ever loved anyone?

18:39.960 --> 18:41.160
Don't forget that

18:41.880 --> 18:43.519
you are doing a mission

18:45.039 --> 18:47.519
chen Jia Ping is a tool you pretended to use.

18:47.519 --> 18:49.680
When did you start separating private interests from private interests?

18:55.680 --> 18:56.440
Have you ever suspected

18:58.000 --> 19:00.119
about Chen Jia Ping's identity?

19:02.680 --> 19:04.319
Or did you already suspect that?

19:05.160 --> 19:06.640
But you kept it a secret from me.

19:08.599 --> 19:10.119
You can even say that

19:10.519 --> 19:13.359
your faith has started to deteriorate.

19:17.160 --> 19:18.720
My belief has not changed.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.279
You are changing.

19:22.400 --> 19:23.599
It's you all.

19:25.440 --> 19:27.200
Everything you're doing right now

19:27.200 --> 19:28.759
Is still anti-Japanese and saving the country?

19:29.759 --> 19:32.240
Are you still doing all that?

19:32.759 --> 19:35.039
Your so-called counterfeiting plan

19:35.440 --> 19:37.559
that you were trying to forge the border?

19:38.440 --> 19:40.400
It is our Anti-Japanese Alliance.

19:40.400 --> 19:42.680
And millions of Chinese people.

19:42.680 --> 19:45.000
Why are you doing this?

19:46.839 --> 19:47.680
Director Jiang,

19:49.720 --> 19:51.079
I know my subordinates well.

19:51.759 --> 19:53.400
Zuo Shuangtao was acting on impulse.

19:53.880 --> 19:55.599
Let her go outside to calm down.

19:56.119 --> 19:57.519
Let her go out to calm down.

19:57.519 --> 19:58.640
Lock her up first.

19:58.640 --> 19:59.720
Alright.

20:03.440 --> 20:04.480
Come on.

20:15.240 --> 20:16.960
It's fine if you always complain to me.

20:16.960 --> 20:18.000
How can you really

20:19.359 --> 20:20.279
look at yourself.

20:27.759 --> 20:29.119
Answer me sincerely.

20:31.680 --> 20:33.279
Was I really wrong?

20:43.119 --> 20:45.200
We are all executors of orders.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.039
Political issues are complicated.

20:48.960 --> 20:51.119
They have their own reasons

20:51.119 --> 20:52.680
they have their own reasons.

20:53.440 --> 20:54.759
We don't need to ask too much.

20:56.279 --> 20:57.319
But I don't think

20:58.599 --> 21:00.519
you are not as determined as before

21:03.480 --> 21:06.240
how did Chen Jia Ping die?

21:12.359 --> 21:14.119
He and another wanted criminal

21:15.960 --> 21:17.079
were caught...

21:20.480 --> 21:21.599
When he escaped from the prison.

21:24.880 --> 21:25.759
It was Neitian.

21:28.759 --> 21:30.599
Uchida killed him with her own hands.

21:31.319 --> 21:32.519
Did you see the corpse?

21:37.079 --> 21:38.440
I think

21:39.400 --> 21:40.880
he'll give you a surprise.

21:44.759 --> 21:45.640
Do you think

21:48.359 --> 21:50.039
chen Jiaping will still be alive?

21:52.279 --> 21:53.960
You really love him.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.160
Really?

21:58.440 --> 22:00.000
I'm not qualified to love him.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.440
I shouldn't have agreed to your marriage.

22:17.079 --> 22:17.960
Captain Liu.

22:19.240 --> 22:20.519
Although you're strict,

22:23.319 --> 22:25.400
I think you're different from Director Jiang.

22:27.759 --> 22:29.599
I can feel

22:32.400 --> 22:33.680
I can feel it.

22:34.839 --> 22:36.079
The shiny thing

22:54.119 --> 22:55.559
I know what's in your mind.

22:56.799 --> 22:57.960
I went through that, too.

22:58.920 --> 23:01.640
I also want to talk to you.

23:02.880 --> 23:04.200
But today is not the right time.

23:05.759 --> 23:06.559
Another time.

23:10.680 --> 23:11.559
Captain Liu.

23:13.440 --> 23:14.319
Do you think

23:17.359 --> 23:18.480
could Chen Jiaping

23:18.480 --> 23:20.480
give us a surprise this time?

23:45.720 --> 23:47.240
Have you figured out how to get out?

23:49.519 --> 23:50.480
How did you get out?

23:51.720 --> 23:52.640
The power was cut.

23:52.920 --> 23:54.799
Lead Nishimura here to grab the key.

23:55.920 --> 23:56.839
Officer Uchida.

23:57.599 --> 23:59.000
Please stab me.

24:02.799 --> 24:03.640
You're trying to save me.

24:04.920 --> 24:06.160
Although I was wounded,

24:06.839 --> 24:07.920
I'm still alive.

24:07.920 --> 24:08.640
You can't die.

24:09.079 --> 24:10.519
You are the God.

24:10.519 --> 24:11.920
I'm not going to kick your ass.

24:12.559 --> 24:13.680
I won't die.

24:14.519 --> 24:15.359
Listen to me.

24:16.480 --> 24:17.599
Now if you kill me,

24:17.599 --> 24:18.480
you won't be able to go out.

24:19.240 --> 24:20.200
And killing me

24:20.680 --> 24:21.759
It won't do you any good.

24:22.599 --> 24:23.759
Then I can keep you,

24:24.240 --> 24:25.720
what good does that do me?

24:25.720 --> 24:26.920
I can give you money,

24:28.000 --> 24:29.480
just like our promise.

24:31.720 --> 24:32.799
You want to lie to me again?

24:33.799 --> 24:34.920
In this case,

24:35.680 --> 24:36.519
I won't lie to you.

24:36.799 --> 24:38.559
Or we end up

24:38.559 --> 24:39.839
and end up with each other.

24:40.599 --> 24:41.599
I can swear that

24:42.519 --> 24:43.680
as long as we're both out,

24:44.200 --> 24:45.440
I'll pay you back.

24:53.160 --> 24:54.039
Without money,

24:54.680 --> 24:56.279
It's useless to go out.

24:56.880 --> 24:57.319
Right?

24:57.319 --> 24:57.920
Where is the money?

24:58.640 --> 24:59.400
I'm hiding somewhere

24:59.400 --> 25:00.640
could not be found by others.

25:01.559 --> 25:02.279
Where is it?

25:02.440 --> 25:03.559
I can take you there.

25:04.440 --> 25:05.359
But what if I tell you

25:05.359 --> 25:06.839
what if you kill me?

25:10.200 --> 25:11.680
You can't get out here either.

25:18.480 --> 25:19.440
Do you have a way?

25:26.720 --> 25:27.920
Pushan Villa's cars

25:28.240 --> 25:30.000
pass by every night.

25:31.000 --> 25:31.880
Pushanzhuang.

25:32.319 --> 25:34.079
A charity organized by Mr. Du.

25:34.880 --> 25:37.559
People died of starvation in the city.

25:38.279 --> 25:40.039
Pushan Zhuang's cars will

25:40.279 --> 25:41.240
pull them out of the city

25:41.640 --> 25:42.440
and buried them.

25:52.119 --> 25:53.160
Get down and help!

25:59.640 --> 26:00.640
Come over there.

26:41.079 --> 26:41.440
Great Lord.

26:41.440 --> 26:42.119
Pass, please.

26:50.839 --> 26:51.559
Thank you, Your Majesty.

26:52.119 --> 26:52.720
Hold on.

26:53.319 --> 26:54.000
Captain!

26:54.000 --> 26:55.200
It was Pushanzhuang's carriage.

26:55.440 --> 26:56.960
The carriage that dragged those dead people is here again.

26:57.440 --> 26:58.000
That's right.

26:58.440 --> 26:59.640
Why would I not believe it?

26:59.640 --> 27:01.440
So many dead people?

27:28.799 --> 27:30.000
I've checked already.

27:30.279 --> 27:31.119
There're dead bodies.

27:31.119 --> 27:31.839
Let them go.

27:31.960 --> 27:32.519
Yes

27:37.960 --> 27:38.920
stop.

27:39.039 --> 27:39.920
I can't hold it in anymore.

27:42.640 --> 27:43.359
I'll go with you.

27:43.599 --> 27:44.319
Come on.

27:59.400 --> 28:01.160
Are you sure the box is still in the hotel?

28:01.680 --> 28:02.359
Don't worry.

28:02.359 --> 28:03.000
He must be there.

28:03.519 --> 28:05.359
I was captured by a traitor.

28:05.359 --> 28:07.000
The Japanese don't know about the box.

28:22.799 --> 28:23.559
What about

28:24.640 --> 28:25.400
did you find him?

28:33.440 --> 28:34.839
That's not necessary.

28:35.319 --> 28:36.519
Once fired,

28:36.519 --> 28:38.000
and disturbs the guests in the hotel,

28:38.000 --> 28:40.319
the Japanese might catch him again.

28:40.319 --> 28:41.440
The loss outweighs the gain.

28:41.759 --> 28:43.119
If that comes to the case,

28:43.119 --> 28:44.319
stop acting.

28:45.240 --> 28:46.440
What you want

28:46.440 --> 28:47.680
Is not money at all.

28:50.640 --> 28:52.000
Back in Maoshan Mountain,

28:52.319 --> 28:53.519
you were in my class.

28:57.480 --> 28:58.680
Are you a Communist Party member?

29:01.079 --> 29:01.960
What are you talking about?

29:01.960 --> 29:03.119
Did you recognize the wrong person?

29:03.640 --> 29:05.519
You forgot my ability to remember everything.

29:06.240 --> 29:08.440
I recognized you when I first met you in the detention center.

29:08.440 --> 29:09.680
When I first saw you

29:10.200 --> 29:11.359
what you want

29:11.359 --> 29:13.119
Is another thing in the box.

29:13.960 --> 29:14.920
You know clearly

29:15.279 --> 29:16.440
you know it clearly.

29:17.759 --> 29:19.119
If you say that,

29:20.200 --> 29:22.319
we're no longer in the same boat.

29:22.640 --> 29:24.039
I've never been in the same boat

29:24.279 --> 29:25.920
with your Communist Party.

29:57.880 --> 29:58.640
Captain Liu,

30:00.119 --> 30:01.480
dayan got in touch.

30:12.920 --> 30:13.559
Two-peach.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.000
I have a good news for you

30:21.799 --> 30:23.559
chen Jiaping should still be alive

30:30.519 --> 30:31.440
really

30:32.279 --> 30:33.880
but his real identity

30:34.440 --> 30:35.599
he's a Communist Party member.

30:36.720 --> 30:37.599
Communist Party?

30:40.079 --> 30:41.039
Is there any evidence?

30:41.559 --> 30:42.920
It's our guy who escaped with him.

30:42.920 --> 30:44.039
The name is Wang Dapu.

30:44.599 --> 30:46.559
When he was lurking in Yan'an,

30:47.519 --> 30:49.039
he stole the copper plate of the coin

30:49.839 --> 30:51.319
chen Jiaping tried to get it back,

30:51.319 --> 30:52.680
but he couldn't.

30:53.160 --> 30:54.079
And Wang Dapu

30:54.079 --> 30:56.039
I met him in Maoshan Mountain before.

30:56.880 --> 30:58.839
He is a Communist Party member.

30:59.640 --> 31:01.279
That he is a Communist Party.

31:02.839 --> 31:04.480
Where Chen Jiaping is now?

31:06.279 --> 31:07.759
Wang Dapu wanted to get rid of him,

31:08.039 --> 31:09.000
but he ran away.

31:10.200 --> 31:11.160
No one knows now.

31:23.319 --> 31:24.119
What about

31:26.960 --> 31:28.720
are you feeling better now?

31:29.720 --> 31:31.039
But later,

31:31.880 --> 31:34.240
you have to apologize to Director Jiang with me.

31:35.519 --> 31:36.960
He's in a good mood.

31:36.960 --> 31:38.680
Maybe he can show you a side of the net.

31:39.559 --> 31:40.240
I won't go.

31:40.240 --> 31:40.759
Listen to me.

31:40.759 --> 31:41.640
That's a must.

31:54.400 --> 31:55.240
Captain Liu,

31:56.000 --> 31:57.880
how should I apologize to Director Jiang?

32:01.240 --> 32:03.160
You've contributed a lot this time

32:04.440 --> 32:06.240
as an undercover in Yan'an for many years

32:06.480 --> 32:07.599
mastermind with painstaking effort

32:08.279 --> 32:10.759
to finally get this priceless

32:10.759 --> 32:12.000
this priceless copper coin.

32:13.759 --> 32:15.440
The interests of the party and state come first.

32:15.440 --> 32:16.640
For the sake of the overall interests of the Party and state,

32:16.640 --> 32:17.599
work with utter devotion

32:17.599 --> 32:18.559
until my heart stops beating

32:20.880 --> 32:21.559
come.

32:21.559 --> 32:22.160
Have a seat.

32:22.160 --> 32:22.880
Sit down.

32:30.839 --> 32:31.680
Director Jiang,

32:33.319 --> 32:34.920
I've just talked to Zuo Shuangtao.

32:34.920 --> 32:36.160
She also regrets very much

32:36.160 --> 32:37.279
what she did.

32:37.599 --> 32:39.119
Why not let her write a self-review

32:39.519 --> 32:40.680
to reflect on herself.

32:46.559 --> 32:47.440
Director Jiang,

32:48.079 --> 32:49.839
you can punish me as you like.

32:52.640 --> 32:55.319
You just want me to pour a cup of wine for you.

32:57.279 --> 32:58.279
Is that OK?

32:59.599 --> 33:00.680
We can celebrate together.

33:05.319 --> 33:05.960
Alright!

33:06.599 --> 33:07.799
Let's celebrate together.

33:07.799 --> 33:08.519
Chief, please.

33:08.799 --> 33:09.480
Come on.

33:13.119 --> 33:13.759
Come on.

33:14.279 --> 33:15.160
Thank you, Director.

33:18.039 --> 33:19.119
To help us

33:19.519 --> 33:21.920
obtaining the copper plate of the coins.

33:21.920 --> 33:22.759
For the Imperial Concubine Qiao.

33:23.200 --> 33:24.880
To the

33:24.880 --> 33:26.839
the first successful step of our plan.

33:26.839 --> 33:27.680
Cheers!

33:27.680 --> 33:28.480
Cheers.

33:33.480 --> 33:35.119
The Communist Party of China

33:35.119 --> 33:36.160
the Chinese Communist Party border area?

33:36.440 --> 33:37.319
To be honest,

33:38.000 --> 33:39.920
after two years of observation and research,

33:40.200 --> 33:41.759
they are thriving.

33:42.279 --> 33:43.400
Over time,

33:43.799 --> 33:45.359
a great threat to the Party and the state.

33:46.160 --> 33:47.680
So it is more important

33:48.480 --> 33:50.640
Is more important than anti-Japanese war.

33:50.640 --> 33:51.799
The chairman said

33:51.799 --> 33:54.039
the Japanese are a threat to us,

33:54.039 --> 33:56.240
but the Communists are the most dangerous.

33:56.240 --> 33:57.799
Destroying the economy of the border region.

33:59.119 --> 34:00.680
Is the most important now.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.079
Director, please be discerning.

34:03.279 --> 34:05.079
But it came from one of the magpies.

34:05.079 --> 34:06.400
The formula for the border currency printing paper

34:06.799 --> 34:08.000
Is still missing.

34:09.000 --> 34:09.880
That's right.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.840
I've been thinking about the same thing.

34:14.880 --> 34:16.639
If the formula is really

34:18.760 --> 34:19.559
where's the copper plate?

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
It's gone.

34:27.000 --> 34:27.880
Are you leaving?

34:28.719 --> 34:29.719
Let me see you off.

34:39.519 --> 34:40.280
Where is Left Shuangtao?

34:41.119 --> 34:41.719
He went that way.

34:41.719 --> 34:42.280
Chase them!

34:51.159 --> 34:51.960
She can't run far.

34:51.960 --> 34:52.639
Let's look for her separately.

34:52.639 --> 34:53.519
Yes

35:20.360 --> 35:21.159
stop.

35:24.920 --> 35:25.559
Turn around.

35:39.199 --> 35:40.079
Give me the copper plate.

35:59.360 --> 36:00.280
You know how important

36:00.280 --> 36:01.280
Is to me?

36:01.280 --> 36:02.519
You traitor.

36:15.360 --> 36:15.840
Come on.

36:17.239 --> 36:18.119
How are you?

36:18.119 --> 36:18.840
Are you all right?

36:19.599 --> 36:20.920
Why are you here?

36:21.800 --> 36:23.159
I almost fell into his hands.

36:23.400 --> 36:25.159
After I escaped, I followed him secretly

36:31.159 --> 36:32.079
I got it

36:41.599 --> 36:43.239
so you know about my identity.

36:45.039 --> 36:45.800
Know?

36:48.079 --> 36:49.119
Then you also know that

36:49.559 --> 36:51.000
what that means

36:51.440 --> 36:52.639
what does that mean?

36:55.639 --> 36:56.400
I know.

36:56.840 --> 36:57.920
Why did you do that?

36:59.760 --> 37:01.280
For the belief

37:02.440 --> 37:04.440
that I once lost and now I've found back.

37:08.280 --> 37:09.639
Jiang Zhaoguo and others are looking for me.

37:10.639 --> 37:11.840
I'll distract them.

37:12.639 --> 37:13.559
Stop joking around.

37:13.760 --> 37:14.719
We should go together.

37:16.199 --> 37:17.719
They don't know you're here.

37:18.360 --> 37:19.840
Their target is me.

37:19.840 --> 37:21.159
You have a chance to escape.

37:27.360 --> 37:29.079
You know I'm right.

37:31.559 --> 37:32.519
That the copper plate

37:32.519 --> 37:34.119
get the hands of Jiang Zhaoguo.

37:35.679 --> 37:36.400
Alright?

37:40.480 --> 37:41.199
Take this.

37:45.800 --> 37:46.800
Let's each take one.

37:47.639 --> 37:49.239
Even if either of us gets caught,

37:49.880 --> 37:51.320
we will have access to the other party.

37:51.760 --> 37:52.480
Got it?

37:59.800 --> 38:00.599
See you at home.

38:05.760 --> 38:06.440
Come on.

38:17.320 --> 38:17.960
Stop!

38:31.920 --> 38:33.239
There are people around us.

38:33.920 --> 38:34.960
You won't be able to get away.

38:46.119 --> 38:47.519
Don't worry.

38:47.519 --> 38:48.840
Captain Liu told me to

38:48.840 --> 38:49.840
that he hid you here.

38:50.199 --> 38:51.199
The headquarters.

38:51.199 --> 38:52.000
That's right.

38:52.679 --> 38:54.320
Captain Liu ordered me to save you.

38:54.320 --> 38:56.599
Luckily I found you before Director Jiang's men

38:56.599 --> 38:57.519
before Director Jiang's men got there.

38:58.840 --> 38:59.719
Thank you

39:24.400 --> 39:25.079
jia Ping.

39:25.880 --> 39:27.320
Zhou Qingfang saved me.

39:27.880 --> 39:29.320
I almost got caught just now.

39:31.199 --> 39:32.079
Sorry

39:32.960 --> 39:34.320
who told you about this place?

39:34.320 --> 39:35.199
Liu Wuchang.

39:37.159 --> 39:37.800
Then

39:38.840 --> 39:40.559
you guys hide here for a while.

39:40.559 --> 39:42.079
I'll meet up with Captain Liu.

39:42.360 --> 39:43.639
Director Jiang may even send people

39:43.639 --> 39:45.079
to search for you everywhere.

39:45.719 --> 39:47.880
Make sure you're safe before you leave.

39:48.599 --> 39:49.280
Alright.

40:05.719 --> 40:07.280
I ran into Liu Wuchang just now.

40:08.360 --> 40:09.639
I thought

40:09.639 --> 40:11.000
he wanted the copper plate.

40:11.320 --> 40:12.320
But unexpectedly,

40:12.320 --> 40:14.639
he told me a secret way to avoid the search

40:14.920 --> 40:15.760
then I'll come.

40:18.480 --> 40:21.400
Captain Liu and Jiang Zhaoguo are different people.

40:22.039 --> 40:22.719
Right.

40:23.280 --> 40:25.119
I misunderstood him before.

40:25.519 --> 40:26.880
But now,

40:26.880 --> 40:28.719
he chose the right way.

40:30.480 --> 40:32.119
I have many questions for you.

40:40.320 --> 40:40.840
Just go ahead.

40:42.440 --> 40:43.800
You'll be four of clubs.

40:45.920 --> 40:47.239
When did you join the Communist Party?

40:47.760 --> 40:48.559
Nanjing.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
Before you knew me,

40:51.960 --> 40:53.239
when I first met you,

40:54.679 --> 40:56.320
I was confused,

40:57.360 --> 40:59.039
I didn't know what the future held in China.

40:59.599 --> 41:01.400
Or mine.

41:02.440 --> 41:04.079
But the communist ideology

41:04.760 --> 41:06.000
showed me the way.

41:08.639 --> 41:11.000
We would be together.

41:11.880 --> 41:13.559
Why didn't I notice at all?

41:15.280 --> 41:16.400
What about the organization?

41:17.039 --> 41:18.320
Let me join the Communist Party secretly.

41:19.039 --> 41:20.840
But I wanted to keep my original identity.

41:21.760 --> 41:22.760
Then

41:23.960 --> 41:26.119
you didn't show up on the day we agreed to register the marriage.

41:27.039 --> 41:28.119
Why did you lie to me?

41:30.440 --> 41:31.440
I'm not lying to you.

41:31.920 --> 41:33.280
In fact, our organization has approved

41:33.280 --> 41:34.800
our marriage application.

41:35.880 --> 41:37.440
But there was an assignment that day.

41:38.039 --> 41:39.559
And it was my first mission.

41:41.760 --> 41:43.719
And left without saying goodbye.

41:44.960 --> 41:46.320
After that, he asked me

41:46.719 --> 41:48.400
and asked me to carry out an undercover task.

41:48.960 --> 41:50.360
I knew at that moment

41:51.000 --> 41:52.920
I could never return to you again.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.159
That's why

41:56.519 --> 41:58.280
you left me in Nanjing.

41:59.800 --> 42:01.440
Actually, I went back once.

42:01.960 --> 42:03.199
But we have discipline.

42:04.159 --> 42:05.639
That's why I couldn't meet you.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.920
And then you left Nanjing.

42:10.280 --> 42:11.880
That's when

42:13.400 --> 42:14.760
I first met Jun Tong at that time.

42:15.840 --> 42:18.159
And we have taken different paths since then.

42:19.760 --> 42:21.000
But we reach the same goal by taking different paths.

42:21.880 --> 42:23.840
Don't we meet again in Shanghai?

42:25.039 --> 42:25.880
In Shanghai?

42:27.000 --> 42:29.480
That day in Shanghai...

42:30.320 --> 42:32.280
You were carrying out a CPC mission?

42:34.440 --> 42:36.559
Zhao An almost found me anyway.

42:36.559 --> 42:38.800
I have to come up with a reasonable reason

42:38.800 --> 42:41.119
to prove why I was at the train station.

42:41.719 --> 42:43.159
So you used me.

42:43.159 --> 42:44.519
You also used me.

42:44.960 --> 42:47.840
Otherwise, how can I clear your suspicion of assassinating Shangshan Hu?

42:49.440 --> 42:51.119
I did use you.

42:52.119 --> 42:53.000
But when I saw you,

42:53.000 --> 42:54.199
to see you.

42:55.920 --> 42:56.679
What about you?

42:57.119 --> 42:57.960
Are you happy?
