01:33.840 --> 01:35.040
classmates

01:35.079 --> 01:37.719
Today we have a special expert here

01:37.799 --> 01:38.920
Come and give a lecture to everyone

01:38.920 --> 01:39.840
Everyone is welcome

01:50.000 --> 01:50.920
Hello students

01:52.359 --> 01:53.680
before class

01:54.359 --> 01:55.879
I want to ask you a question first

01:56.519 --> 01:57.400
revolution

01:58.079 --> 01:59.560
What exactly do you rely on?

02:00.840 --> 02:02.359
Many students may say

02:03.040 --> 02:04.280
Rely on faith

02:05.040 --> 02:06.439
Relying on the barrel of a gun

02:07.439 --> 02:08.599
These are all correct

02:09.319 --> 02:10.800
But I want to tell you today

02:10.800 --> 02:12.080
crucial point

02:13.240 --> 02:14.280
That's the economy

02:15.039 --> 02:16.400
no financial support

02:16.400 --> 02:17.039
No money

02:17.680 --> 02:19.240
There are many things you can't do

02:19.840 --> 02:21.080
Where does that money come from?

02:22.039 --> 02:23.039
development finance

02:24.039 --> 02:25.439
Many students will ask again

02:25.960 --> 02:27.280
So what is finance?

02:28.319 --> 02:29.080
today

02:29.639 --> 02:30.719
Let's start with this one

02:30.919 --> 02:32.680
Talking about the silver coins circulating in the base area

02:54.400 --> 02:55.120
Hello

02:55.680 --> 02:56.680
Come out for a moment

02:57.000 --> 02:58.120
to Baliqiao Road

02:58.120 --> 02:59.639
There is a Huiqing teahouse

02:59.639 --> 03:00.599
I'm here waiting for you

03:00.599 --> 03:01.280
fast

03:01.639 --> 03:02.520
Is there a problem

03:03.159 --> 03:04.479
You'll know when you come

03:04.479 --> 03:05.080
Remember

03:05.280 --> 03:07.240
Don't let Zhao An's people see you

03:07.879 --> 03:08.879
Zhao An

03:09.240 --> 03:10.759
Why is he causing trouble for me again?

03:11.039 --> 03:12.439
Anyway, you remember

03:12.439 --> 03:14.479
Don't let Zhao An's people see you

03:14.840 --> 03:15.280
good

03:15.560 --> 03:16.479
See you soon

03:16.479 --> 03:17.360
See you or leave

03:35.960 --> 03:36.719
Hello

03:36.719 --> 03:37.520
Guoguo

03:38.240 --> 03:39.680
I have to go out later

03:39.680 --> 03:41.199
Didn’t you say you wanted to buy stationery?

03:41.560 --> 03:42.680
I'll take you along the way

03:46.280 --> 03:46.639
good

03:47.000 --> 03:48.360
Then we'll see you in the parking lot.

03:48.840 --> 03:49.280
good

03:49.639 --> 03:50.319
hurry up

04:22.639 --> 04:24.199
Why is Chen Shugan following us?

04:28.360 --> 04:29.079
Catch me

04:30.720 --> 04:31.560
Catch you

04:31.959 --> 04:33.920
Jiang Zhaoguo was probably captured by the Japanese

04:34.279 --> 04:35.839
And maybe betrayed me

04:36.240 --> 04:37.360
how do you know

04:38.040 --> 04:39.439
This morning Luo Guanqun and Zhao An

04:39.439 --> 04:40.720
Was called to the Military Police Headquarters

04:40.839 --> 04:42.279
I think Uchida must have given them instructions.

04:42.399 --> 04:43.279
Order to arrest me

04:44.399 --> 04:46.000
I didn’t expect Director Jiang to be that kind of person

04:47.000 --> 04:47.720
betrayed me

04:47.720 --> 04:48.959
On the one hand, it's to protect you

04:49.160 --> 04:49.759
on the other hand

04:49.759 --> 04:51.480
You can borrow the help of the Japanese to kill me

04:53.199 --> 04:54.079
In this case

04:54.600 --> 04:55.639
I'll run with you

04:59.079 --> 04:59.720
I call you out

04:59.720 --> 05:01.120
Not running away with me

05:01.560 --> 05:03.319
Running away won't solve any problems

05:04.519 --> 05:06.199
On the contrary, it is Luo Guanqun, the old fox

05:06.199 --> 05:07.319
Better skills

05:08.000 --> 05:09.199
To lure me out on purpose

05:16.480 --> 05:18.360
In order to prevent you from falling into Zhao An's hands, he

05:20.160 --> 05:22.360
Then I will give him Lao Luo some face.

05:22.360 --> 05:23.800
Just leave me to him

05:28.000 --> 05:29.759
Is there no other way?

05:30.480 --> 05:31.079
What should I do?

05:31.079 --> 05:32.560
I watched you being arrested

05:37.199 --> 05:37.759
Guoguo

05:38.720 --> 05:40.040
Maybe only you can save me

05:41.759 --> 05:43.000
How can I save you?

05:46.319 --> 05:47.759
I haven't thought of it yet

06:00.399 --> 06:01.759
You go on as usual now

06:01.759 --> 06:02.879
Go buy your stationery

06:05.240 --> 06:06.000
What if

06:10.439 --> 06:11.199
in case they

06:12.360 --> 06:13.439
What if I kill you?

06:15.560 --> 06:16.519
I thought about it

06:17.160 --> 06:18.040
Jiang Zhaoguo can be because

06:18.040 --> 06:19.639
Hanlu and I got too close

06:19.959 --> 06:21.360
Although this reason is somewhat far-fetched

06:22.000 --> 06:23.800
But until they have no conclusive evidence

06:24.319 --> 06:25.639
I can resist for a while

06:34.800 --> 06:36.000
I can not do it

06:40.079 --> 06:41.000
You can do it

06:41.480 --> 06:42.480
believe in yourself

06:51.720 --> 06:53.160
Wait until this happens

06:54.920 --> 06:55.839
You promised me

06:58.319 --> 07:00.040
Must continue

07:00.399 --> 07:01.959
Being a waste of time

07:03.480 --> 07:04.879
Peacefully

07:05.879 --> 07:07.000
Hang around forever

07:10.839 --> 07:12.079
No matter if I am a waste or not

07:12.480 --> 07:13.839
I will be safe and sound

07:20.240 --> 07:21.199
Get off quickly

07:51.279 --> 07:52.879
Pick me up in person, Lao Luo

07:55.120 --> 07:57.040
You have to go with me to the Gendarmerie Headquarters

07:58.560 --> 07:59.920
Promotion or salary increase?

08:02.360 --> 08:03.720
You'll know when you go there

08:10.000 --> 08:12.399
I really can't help you this time

08:24.560 --> 08:25.680
Is Manager Luo back?

08:26.120 --> 08:26.800
No

08:27.319 --> 08:28.279
The cars are parked downstairs

08:28.279 --> 08:29.240
He said he hadn't come back yet

08:29.240 --> 08:29.680
this

08:30.399 --> 08:31.480
Really not back

08:31.480 --> 08:32.399
No one inside

08:37.039 --> 08:37.799
Miss Zuo

08:38.120 --> 08:38.919
Miss Zuo

08:40.039 --> 08:40.840
Manager Luo

08:41.519 --> 08:42.879
Why are you hiding from me?

08:44.080 --> 08:44.879
large spoon

08:45.240 --> 08:46.080
are you blind

08:46.080 --> 08:47.440
Don't I know I'm here?

08:47.679 --> 08:48.919
Didn't pay attention just now

08:50.519 --> 08:51.639
Are you looking for me

08:52.559 --> 08:55.279
I heard that you arrested Chen Jiaping with your own hands

08:56.080 --> 08:56.679
yes

08:57.759 --> 08:59.039
Follow orders

08:59.039 --> 09:00.279
I have no way

09:01.000 --> 09:02.240
Heart-wrenching

09:03.240 --> 09:05.360
At least you should say something for him

09:05.639 --> 09:06.480
Is it right

09:07.639 --> 09:08.600
Miss Zuo

09:08.600 --> 09:09.919
You don't know

09:09.919 --> 09:10.759
Our manager Luo

09:10.879 --> 09:12.600
This talk is almost broken.

09:13.399 --> 09:14.320
no way

09:14.720 --> 09:16.320
Because the Japanese have evidence

09:16.799 --> 09:17.840
what evidence

09:18.879 --> 09:19.919
Hurry up and get some tea

09:21.159 --> 09:22.799
You should have heard about it

09:22.799 --> 09:24.519
Yesterday's military reunification agent

09:24.519 --> 09:26.360
Sneak attack on Japanese military uniform factory

09:26.519 --> 09:27.840
The leader was sent from Chongqing

09:27.840 --> 09:28.960
The official position is not small

09:29.159 --> 09:30.879
A labor certificate was found on him

09:31.039 --> 09:32.600
Said it was given by Chen Jiaping

09:35.720 --> 09:38.639
Taihe Trading Company has a labor certificate in hand

09:39.080 --> 09:40.480
Only Zhao An

09:40.799 --> 09:41.360
yes

09:41.679 --> 09:43.120
Then maybe Chen Jiaping stole it

09:43.320 --> 09:44.039
unimportant

09:44.399 --> 09:45.519
The focus is on oral confession

09:45.799 --> 09:46.559
People said

09:46.960 --> 09:48.039
The one who colluded was Chen Jiaping

09:48.120 --> 09:49.240
Didn’t mention Zhao An

09:49.399 --> 09:50.480
You believe it

09:50.679 --> 09:52.399
The Japanese believed it

09:53.200 --> 09:55.799
The Gendarmerie Headquarters came to our house and searched it all over.

09:56.559 --> 09:57.759
Chen Jiaping's office

09:57.759 --> 09:59.039
Also turned upside down

09:59.039 --> 10:01.639
There is no evidence of collusion with Chongqing.

10:01.639 --> 10:02.919
Just a confession

10:02.919 --> 10:04.440
Why do you arrest him?

10:05.039 --> 10:05.360
Miss Zuo

10:05.360 --> 10:05.960
drink tea

10:08.200 --> 10:08.639
Miss Zuo

10:08.639 --> 10:09.639
Calm down your anger

10:09.960 --> 10:11.159
Japanese

10:11.159 --> 10:12.879
Don't call it a confession.

10:13.039 --> 10:14.120
Just a look

10:14.120 --> 10:15.720
He can also be convicted immediately

10:16.440 --> 10:17.320
And now

10:17.320 --> 10:18.240
This is not only

10:18.240 --> 10:19.720
It's about this labor certificate.

10:19.960 --> 10:21.679
The Japanese say they have this information

10:21.679 --> 10:24.399
There is a military spy codenamed Five of Hearts

10:24.639 --> 10:26.399
Just lurking in our business

10:27.039 --> 10:29.240
Now the Japanese suspect Chen Jiaping

10:29.799 --> 10:31.120
It's the five of hearts

10:33.000 --> 10:34.519
This is simply impossible

10:34.639 --> 10:36.159
I don’t think it’s possible either.

10:36.639 --> 10:37.679
Just found a four of clubs

10:37.679 --> 10:39.440
Now comes another Five of Hearts

10:39.440 --> 10:39.960
Otherwise

10:39.960 --> 10:40.879
Call them all

10:40.879 --> 10:42.399
Come play poker at my place

10:43.279 --> 10:44.399
Endless

10:45.840 --> 10:46.799
Manager Luo

10:47.960 --> 10:50.159
Chen Jiaping has been following you for so long

10:50.159 --> 10:52.120
This business is up and down

10:52.120 --> 10:54.080
Everyone knows that he is your Manager Luo’s man

10:54.200 --> 10:55.759
Have you never thought about it?

10:56.559 --> 10:58.600
Could it be that someone wanted to frame Chen Jiaping first?

10:58.600 --> 10:59.720
Drag you into the water again

11:01.320 --> 11:02.440
I have a breeze on my sleeves

11:03.480 --> 11:05.879
No one can drag me down

11:07.360 --> 11:09.120
Then you just don't want to save me.

11:11.480 --> 11:12.120
Zuo Shuangtao

11:12.120 --> 11:13.879
I feel the same as you

11:14.120 --> 11:16.840
I'm always worried about Jia Ping's safety.

11:43.759 --> 11:44.559
Manager Luo

11:47.320 --> 11:49.080
I can only ask you now

11:51.480 --> 11:52.759
Let me beg you

11:55.120 --> 11:56.799
Please save Chen Jiaping

12:01.720 --> 12:02.240
Manager Luo

12:02.360 --> 12:03.399
There will be a dinner party later

12:03.399 --> 12:04.279
OK OK OK

12:06.279 --> 12:07.320
Miss Zuo Shuangtao

12:07.440 --> 12:08.320
do not worry

12:08.840 --> 12:09.919
Where the Japanese are

12:10.080 --> 12:11.519
I will definitely go and beg for mercy again

12:11.519 --> 12:12.360
Where are you?

12:12.600 --> 12:13.519
Also think of a way

12:13.720 --> 12:15.360
We work together

12:15.759 --> 12:17.600
Strive to restore Jiaping's innocence

12:20.360 --> 12:21.399
Send, send, send

12:21.639 --> 12:22.799
Miss Zuo, walk slowly

12:23.840 --> 12:24.360
don't worry

12:24.360 --> 12:25.879
Let's think of a solution together

13:07.519 --> 13:09.159
Want to exonerate Chen Jiaping

13:09.759 --> 13:10.840
the only way

13:10.840 --> 13:12.519
To find someone to blame

13:26.039 --> 13:28.679
Since Zhao An became a lackey of the Japanese,

13:29.200 --> 13:31.320
I don’t know how many patriots have been killed

13:31.679 --> 13:32.639
The crime is heinous

13:32.639 --> 13:33.840
A worthy death

13:34.799 --> 13:36.559
Another point is

13:36.559 --> 13:38.639
Zhao An has repeatedly suspected my identity

13:39.120 --> 13:40.240
Don't get rid of him

13:40.840 --> 13:42.440
I'm in a business

13:42.440 --> 13:44.279
It's always at stake

13:44.519 --> 13:45.960
Put the blame on Zhao An

13:45.960 --> 13:47.159
I can't do it alone

13:47.159 --> 13:49.720
We must find a way to bring Luo Guanqun into the group.

13:51.200 --> 13:52.000
Our batch

13:52.000 --> 13:53.440
It has been sent from Wuxi

13:53.679 --> 13:55.080
I'll be in Shanghai in the next two days

13:55.840 --> 13:57.759
After the goods arrive, put them in the warehouse

13:58.159 --> 13:59.120
don't move for now

13:59.559 --> 14:00.320
Why

14:01.480 --> 14:03.120
Now is the time to sell at a high price

14:05.000 --> 14:06.279
Kimura is dead now

14:07.159 --> 14:08.559
You don't know the gendarmerie

14:08.559 --> 14:10.639
Will it cause trouble next?

14:11.120 --> 14:12.960
You must act cautiously at this time

14:19.919 --> 14:21.919
Where are the smuggled materials hidden?

14:30.879 --> 14:33.559
How can we rob this batch of smuggled materials?

14:59.720 --> 15:02.799
How to get this batch of smuggled materials into Zhao An's hands

15:08.399 --> 15:10.679
Waiting for Luo Guanqun to take the bait

15:24.879 --> 15:25.679
Yeah

15:25.799 --> 15:27.240
There is such a batch of cotton yarn

15:27.240 --> 15:28.440
Gave it to Manager Luo

15:30.600 --> 15:31.200
double peach

15:31.679 --> 15:33.360
Why do you suddenly ask about this?

15:35.279 --> 15:36.759
Aunt, you don’t know

15:37.240 --> 15:38.480
Something happened to Jia Ping

15:38.799 --> 15:40.320
Someone framed him for secretly communicating with Chongqing

15:40.320 --> 15:42.320
The gendarmerie headquarters arrested him

15:44.000 --> 15:44.559
dying

15:44.559 --> 15:46.320
How could something like this happen?

15:46.320 --> 15:48.200
That's why I came to inquire about it

15:48.200 --> 15:49.240
Between uncle and manager Luo

15:49.240 --> 15:51.120
Do you have any business dealings?

15:51.120 --> 15:53.480
Then I'll ask Manager Luo to intercede for Jiaping.

15:53.799 --> 15:55.399
I also have some confidence in my heart.

15:55.480 --> 15:56.320
double peach

15:56.879 --> 15:59.480
Just go to Manager Luo and ask for this.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.600
If he doesn't want to help

16:02.000 --> 16:03.600
I asked your uncle to find him

16:04.639 --> 16:06.200
It's better not to let uncle know

16:06.320 --> 16:07.080
Why

16:08.080 --> 16:09.279
His identity

16:09.639 --> 16:11.600
If I don’t come forward, I’ll feel uncomfortable

16:11.600 --> 16:13.039
Come forward and offend the Japanese again

16:13.720 --> 16:14.919
Just don't make it difficult for him

16:14.919 --> 16:16.279
I'll go to Manager Luo to beg for mercy.

16:16.519 --> 16:18.440
If you take some time off, you should be fine.

16:19.519 --> 16:20.360
double peach

16:20.639 --> 16:22.360
You are really becoming more and more sensible

16:23.559 --> 16:24.399
Do not worry

16:24.399 --> 16:26.000
Jia Ping will be fine

16:26.919 --> 16:29.159
Look at you, you’ve lost weight

16:39.000 --> 16:39.559
latté

16:39.559 --> 16:40.120
with added sugar

16:40.120 --> 16:40.840
Thanks

16:41.120 --> 16:41.879
how's it going

16:42.240 --> 16:43.039
this radio station

16:43.039 --> 16:44.679
I helped Luo Guanqun build it before.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.080
The frequency is one one six seven one

16:47.480 --> 16:48.919
So I found it quickly

16:54.399 --> 16:56.120
The number of the winning horse every day

16:56.519 --> 16:57.240
right

16:58.519 --> 16:59.440
this number

16:59.840 --> 17:01.559
Corresponding to these English letters

17:01.639 --> 17:02.960
Just find this

17:03.039 --> 17:04.400
The message was easily solved

17:14.880 --> 17:15.720
What you gave me

17:16.119 --> 17:16.839
All done

17:19.039 --> 17:19.839
last night

17:20.000 --> 17:21.119
I called some brothers

17:21.319 --> 17:23.680
Raid No. 9 berth of Puxi Pier

17:24.119 --> 17:26.000
That's a small cargo ship

17:26.279 --> 17:28.079
The defense is quite lax

17:28.079 --> 17:29.920
It didn't take much effort to get it.

17:30.359 --> 17:31.680
Then we took over the boat

17:31.920 --> 17:34.279
The dozens of boxes of goods that were snatched overnight

17:35.000 --> 17:35.640
Shipped

17:35.640 --> 17:36.279
Eastbound warehouse

17:37.160 --> 17:37.799
this

17:37.880 --> 17:39.599
This is the cotton yarn in that batch of goods

17:41.519 --> 17:41.920
right

17:42.759 --> 17:44.039
It's this kind of cotton yarn

17:44.960 --> 17:46.039
This kind of 26-count medium-count yarn

17:46.039 --> 17:47.480
Only Shanghai can produce

17:48.119 --> 17:49.240
Japan discovered this year

17:49.240 --> 17:51.519
There is such cotton yarn being sold in Kuomintang District

17:51.839 --> 17:53.440
I thought it was smuggled in from Shanghai.

17:53.839 --> 17:54.960
Currently under investigation

17:55.240 --> 17:56.119
That is to say

17:56.440 --> 17:57.680
There is hope to save Chen Jiaping

18:01.039 --> 18:02.519
I can't say there's hope yet

18:03.240 --> 18:04.240
But things

18:04.920 --> 18:07.039
It's starting to develop the way we expected.

18:07.519 --> 18:08.039
good

18:10.680 --> 18:11.319
That's OK

18:11.319 --> 18:12.400
it's okay no problem

18:12.400 --> 18:13.119
don't worry

18:15.319 --> 18:16.079
Mrs. Chen

18:18.839 --> 18:19.519
Mrs. Chen

18:19.640 --> 18:21.039
Already followed your instructions

18:21.039 --> 18:22.160
I pretended to discover it by accident

18:22.160 --> 18:23.680
The batch of cotton yarn from the eastbound warehouse

18:23.920 --> 18:25.599
And promptly reported to Captain Zhao

18:27.319 --> 18:28.200
How did he say

18:28.839 --> 18:30.720
The eastbound warehouse is Captain Zhao’s territory, right?

18:31.039 --> 18:32.519
Cotton yarn is in hot demand again

18:32.759 --> 18:33.720
This meat reaches the mouth

18:33.839 --> 18:35.400
Of course he did his part.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.400
Does he know whose goods it is?

18:40.480 --> 18:42.640
Damasao has been searching the black market for the past two days and asked questions.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.359
Captain Zhao has heard about it

18:45.960 --> 18:47.640
He suspected that it was Luo Guanqun's goods.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.480
You took all the goods away

18:49.599 --> 18:50.759
Of course

18:50.759 --> 18:52.240
Did he become suspicious?

18:52.599 --> 18:54.160
Why are Luo Guanqun’s goods

18:54.440 --> 18:56.480
Will appear in the warehouse on his property

18:56.839 --> 18:59.480
I heard that a ship sank at Puxi Pier

18:59.759 --> 19:01.720
Captain Zhao speculated that it was Manager Luo’s boat.

19:02.119 --> 19:04.000
He doesn't have time to put his goods away at the moment

19:04.319 --> 19:05.720
Just leave it there for a few days

19:07.240 --> 19:08.119
Well done

19:11.559 --> 19:13.440
Have you found the whereabouts of the cotton yarn?

19:22.599 --> 19:24.400
Do you know where this batch of cotton yarn is shipped?

19:24.480 --> 19:25.279
Lin'an

19:25.279 --> 19:26.720
There's a trading point over there

19:26.720 --> 19:28.720
Now the Japanese are investigating

19:29.119 --> 19:31.000
Transporting smuggled goods into the country

19:31.279 --> 19:33.039
Including Hubei and Zhebei

19:33.039 --> 19:34.480
Clues have been found

19:34.480 --> 19:35.559
It's cotton yarn

19:37.720 --> 19:40.079
If this matter is known to the Japanese

19:40.480 --> 19:41.720
Can't keep position

19:42.279 --> 19:43.680
I can't even save my head

19:44.279 --> 19:47.079
The robber stole the cotton yarn

19:47.279 --> 19:48.720
I think at most it is

19:48.720 --> 19:50.200
Get it on the black market and exchange it for money

19:51.319 --> 19:53.400
The Japanese may not know that, right?

19:56.400 --> 19:57.440
hope so

19:58.400 --> 19:59.759
So be sure to remember

20:00.319 --> 20:01.480
Whose is this batch of goods?

20:01.480 --> 20:02.519
must find

20:03.000 --> 20:04.519
It doesn't matter if you can't find it back

20:05.920 --> 20:07.440
Don't let the Japanese know

20:08.200 --> 20:08.799
yes

20:09.720 --> 20:10.240
OK

20:10.240 --> 20:12.200
I will try my best to check it out again.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.920
Did you hear it right?

20:22.400 --> 20:23.880
I heard clearly

20:23.880 --> 20:25.640
Erduidao said it himself

20:27.559 --> 20:29.079
Why did you come across two knives?

20:29.400 --> 20:31.000
Aren't I worried?

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
I just wanted to find a restaurant to have a drink or two.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.160
As a result, I saw two knives coming in.

20:36.039 --> 20:37.480
I'm sitting in the corner

20:37.480 --> 20:38.559
Two knives didn't see me

20:38.799 --> 20:40.319
Then I looked at the two knives

20:40.319 --> 20:41.680
After having a few drinks

20:41.680 --> 20:43.279
Just start talking about the train

20:43.519 --> 20:45.519
And bragging to that guy?

20:45.799 --> 20:47.039
How about telling him how he is?

20:47.039 --> 20:48.920
Helped Zhao An get a batch of cotton yarn

20:49.119 --> 20:50.319
The batch he was talking about

20:51.160 --> 20:52.359
Is this our batch of goods?

20:52.480 --> 20:53.519
Yep

20:53.519 --> 20:54.440
because he said

20:54.440 --> 20:56.440
This batch of cotton yarn belongs to Zhao An’s mortal enemy.

20:56.640 --> 20:57.720
Isn't that you?

20:58.480 --> 20:59.519
He also said

20:59.519 --> 21:01.759
What should Zhao An do to reward him heavily?

21:01.920 --> 21:03.279
How did Zhao An know?

21:07.079 --> 21:08.119
how do you know

21:08.680 --> 21:10.519
Should I go to the black market to inquire?

21:10.759 --> 21:12.160
Then Zhao An found out

21:12.160 --> 21:14.319
He guessed it was your cotton yarn

21:14.319 --> 21:15.319
are you a pig

21:15.319 --> 21:15.880
you are a pig

21:15.880 --> 21:17.000
Pig?

21:19.720 --> 21:20.559
broken

21:22.559 --> 21:24.200
Have you never thought about it?

21:24.720 --> 21:26.720
Could it be that someone wanted to frame Chen Jiaping first?

21:26.720 --> 21:28.079
Drag you into the water again

21:28.640 --> 21:29.480
broken

21:31.200 --> 21:31.960
broken

21:37.480 --> 21:38.920
Why are you making so much noise?

21:38.920 --> 21:39.920
In the middle of the night

21:42.200 --> 21:43.119
Come, come, come

21:56.240 --> 21:57.119
What's wrong

21:58.839 --> 22:00.680
Why was my goods robbed again?

22:02.000 --> 22:03.880
Why was it Zhao An who robbed the goods?

22:05.480 --> 22:07.160
Are you following him again?

22:07.559 --> 22:08.279
Something happened

22:10.640 --> 22:12.359
What does this have to do with me

22:13.680 --> 22:14.720
Why don't you sleep

22:15.200 --> 22:16.200
I'll go to bed first

22:17.880 --> 22:18.559
let me go

22:18.559 --> 22:19.319
you crazy

22:19.319 --> 22:20.039
Lao Luo, you want to hit me again

22:20.039 --> 22:20.799
Yes or no

22:22.039 --> 22:23.000
no

22:38.759 --> 22:40.000
Chen Jiaping is not here

22:41.559 --> 22:43.200
No one bought rice paper for me

22:44.799 --> 22:45.880
Are you talking about Chen Jiaping?

22:45.880 --> 22:47.440
Is it the five of hearts?

22:47.920 --> 22:49.799
Is it not important anymore?

22:52.000 --> 22:54.119
Chen Jiaping needs someone to take responsibility for his crime

22:54.799 --> 22:55.599
take the blame

22:55.599 --> 22:56.119
That

22:56.319 --> 22:57.480
Who can I turn to take the blame?

22:58.079 --> 22:59.359
What do you think?

22:59.799 --> 23:01.920
Where did Jiang Zhaoguo's labor certificate leak out?

23:02.240 --> 23:02.960
Zhao An

23:05.359 --> 23:07.400
Do you mean to let Zhao An

23:09.079 --> 23:09.680
No way

23:09.680 --> 23:10.319
That

23:10.519 --> 23:11.839
It is impossible for the Japanese to believe

23:11.839 --> 23:13.400
Zhao An is the five of hearts.

23:13.759 --> 23:15.079
Japanese people don't believe it

23:15.400 --> 23:17.079
Just try to make him believe it

23:22.440 --> 23:24.440
No matter whether Chen Jiaping is the Five of Hearts or not,

23:24.920 --> 23:26.319
Can't trust him anymore

23:26.920 --> 23:28.200
Since you don't trust him anymore

23:28.200 --> 23:29.720
Then why are you trying your best to save him?

23:29.880 --> 23:31.279
You thought I was saving him

23:31.279 --> 23:32.640
I'm saving myself

23:40.279 --> 23:41.960
This time I'm fighting against the city

23:43.319 --> 23:44.480
Zhao An and I

23:45.160 --> 23:46.200
Not a fish that dies

23:46.960 --> 23:48.000
It’s just that the network is broken

23:48.359 --> 23:49.160
That

23:49.559 --> 23:50.400
any idea

23:50.400 --> 23:52.519
Can Zhao An become the Five of Hearts?

23:55.559 --> 23:56.160
Manager Luo

23:56.160 --> 23:58.000
Do you already have a clever idea?

23:59.799 --> 24:01.599
I talked to Tongji Company in Chongqing

24:01.839 --> 24:03.200
Already discussed

24:04.720 --> 24:07.039
After Jia Ping was sent to the military police headquarters

24:07.240 --> 24:09.039
Naoki Uchida interrogated him personally

24:09.559 --> 24:11.279
Jia Ping said firmly

24:11.279 --> 24:12.440
It's because of Jiang Zhaoguo

24:12.440 --> 24:14.599
Misunderstood his relationship with Han Lu

24:14.680 --> 24:16.720
It was out of jealousy that I deliberately framed him

24:18.920 --> 24:19.599
But the Japanese

24:19.599 --> 24:21.240
I don't believe this statement at all

24:21.960 --> 24:23.839
But apart from Jiang Zhaoguo’s confession

24:24.039 --> 24:25.480
There is no other evidence

24:26.799 --> 24:27.920
I heard

24:28.319 --> 24:30.720
It was Luo Guanqun who begged for Jiaping's love

24:31.440 --> 24:33.319
The Japanese did not execute him

24:33.799 --> 24:36.039
Later, he was transferred to a detention center

24:37.119 --> 24:38.039
detention center

24:38.359 --> 24:40.640
In fact, it is the prison of the Military Police Headquarters.

24:41.200 --> 24:43.160
Just not far from Huasheng Road

24:43.720 --> 24:45.240
So where is Jiang Zhaoguo now?

24:45.880 --> 24:47.119
Jiang Zhaoguo was placed under house arrest in

24:47.119 --> 24:49.160
The internal guest house of the Gendarmerie Headquarters

24:49.759 --> 24:51.319
The Japanese want to instigate him

24:52.759 --> 24:53.599
Thank you

24:55.000 --> 24:56.920
Help me find out so much news

24:57.680 --> 24:59.519
You must have taken a lot of risks.

24:59.519 --> 25:00.519
nothing

25:00.920 --> 25:02.720
I am mainly responsible for organizing files

25:02.720 --> 25:03.720
Access various departments

25:03.720 --> 25:05.599
It is not easy to arouse suspicion

25:07.759 --> 25:08.640
double peach

25:10.200 --> 25:11.839
Is there any way you can save Jia Ping?

25:15.559 --> 25:17.000
I'm still thinking of a way

25:47.759 --> 25:48.799
Come and wash my feet

25:54.799 --> 25:55.640
newcomer

25:56.359 --> 25:58.039
Today it's your turn to wash the boss's feet

26:01.279 --> 26:02.119
past

26:13.079 --> 26:14.480
Letting you wash your feet is to give you face

26:14.960 --> 26:15.960
Beat you and me to death

26:17.799 --> 26:18.799
Brat

26:19.000 --> 26:19.920
I'm done with it, I'm done with it

26:19.920 --> 26:20.799
I'm done, I'm done

26:21.039 --> 26:22.440
Take, take, take

26:22.960 --> 26:24.359
You just deserve a beating

26:24.599 --> 26:25.799
Wash my feet quickly

26:27.000 --> 26:27.920
wash wash wash

26:30.640 --> 26:31.519
hurry up

26:31.519 --> 26:32.440
I'm coming

26:39.000 --> 26:39.960
hurry up

26:47.519 --> 26:47.920
Come

26:47.960 --> 26:48.640
Big brother

26:49.359 --> 26:50.079
Is it comfortable?

26:51.079 --> 26:52.160
That's pretty much it

26:58.079 --> 26:58.920
I tell you

26:59.039 --> 27:01.000
I only wash my wife’s feet, do you understand?

27:08.039 --> 27:08.799
Chen Jiaping

27:09.440 --> 27:10.839
How many times have you caused trouble?

27:11.160 --> 27:11.839
three times

27:12.200 --> 27:13.039
A few days after arriving

27:13.039 --> 27:14.200
We've had trouble three times.

27:14.559 --> 27:16.079
Are you seeking death?

27:16.319 --> 27:17.119
sir

27:17.640 --> 27:19.079
I was wronged

27:19.400 --> 27:21.920
Everyone here says they are wronged

27:22.240 --> 27:23.160
starting today

27:23.160 --> 27:25.160
I'll transfer you to cell 206

27:25.319 --> 27:27.079
Pack your things and follow me

27:29.240 --> 27:30.039
hurry up

27:55.200 --> 27:56.480
How did you do that face?

27:59.319 --> 28:00.680
Fighting by Luo Guanqun

28:02.400 --> 28:04.480
can you take me away right away

28:05.519 --> 28:08.599
I never want to be with that devil again

28:10.200 --> 28:11.079
Luo Guanqun

28:15.319 --> 28:15.839
so

28:16.319 --> 28:18.640
You go to Pudong to stay for a while first

28:18.880 --> 28:20.680
What is temporary residence?

28:21.920 --> 28:24.200
Don’t you want to be with me forever?

28:24.400 --> 28:25.720
together forever

28:28.799 --> 28:29.680
Soon, soon

28:29.680 --> 28:31.039
I don't want to hear it anymore

28:31.039 --> 28:33.559
I've heard it many times

28:39.240 --> 28:40.400
You lied to me

28:41.680 --> 28:42.759
I'm Zhao An

28:43.319 --> 28:45.440
Even if you lie to everyone in the world

28:45.680 --> 28:48.279
I won't even lie to you Zhang Shuyun

28:49.440 --> 28:49.920
That

28:51.160 --> 28:53.119
When will you send me to Pudong?

28:54.160 --> 28:55.240
Tomorrow night at nine o'clock

28:55.839 --> 28:58.119
Wait for me at Huangpu River Ferry No. 7

28:58.279 --> 28:58.960
remember

28:59.480 --> 29:01.240
Don't let Luo Guanqun arouse suspicion

29:09.680 --> 29:10.640
Pack your things quickly

29:11.319 --> 29:12.000
go ahead

29:14.799 --> 29:15.519
Enter

29:31.839 --> 29:32.559
how's it going

29:33.039 --> 29:33.839
seen

29:33.839 --> 29:34.720
His name is Hou Si

29:34.720 --> 29:35.880
He's a smuggler

29:36.559 --> 29:37.759
how could he know

29:38.039 --> 29:39.680
I have cotton yarn on my hand

29:40.039 --> 29:41.799
I found someone to spread the word on the black market.

29:42.039 --> 29:43.720
He followed this clue to find me

29:43.720 --> 29:44.640
How much does he give

29:45.640 --> 29:46.519
One hundred yuan a pack

29:46.759 --> 29:48.359
A pack costs more than 70 yuan on the black market.

29:48.480 --> 29:49.599
He gave one hundred yuan

29:49.880 --> 29:50.640
He knows my background

29:50.640 --> 29:51.519
Won't lie to me

29:52.759 --> 29:55.000
Fourteen hundred bales of cotton yarn

29:56.079 --> 29:57.319
That is

29:57.839 --> 29:59.720
140,000 yuan

30:02.960 --> 30:03.839
But Hou Si said

30:03.839 --> 30:04.680
Such a large quantity of goods

30:04.680 --> 30:05.759
He can't transport it out of Shanghai

30:05.759 --> 30:06.960
We need to figure it out ourselves

30:06.960 --> 30:08.000
He was meeting outside the city

30:08.440 --> 30:10.960
You need to use your brain too.

30:10.960 --> 30:12.480
Very easy to handle

30:12.480 --> 30:13.279
Just Japanese

30:13.279 --> 30:15.480
Let's transport opium to the Kuomintang-controlled areas

30:16.119 --> 30:18.359
We have a pass to leave the city

30:21.200 --> 30:22.119
Chen Jiaping

30:22.119 --> 30:23.000
I tell you

30:23.000 --> 30:24.920
There is a madman living in 206

30:25.160 --> 30:26.960
The three people who lived with him

30:26.960 --> 30:28.799
One had his eyeballs gouged out

30:29.079 --> 30:31.000
One had his ear bitten off

30:32.759 --> 30:33.640
Where is the other one?

30:33.640 --> 30:36.319
The whole hand was bitten off

30:44.640 --> 30:45.400
go ahead

31:26.759 --> 31:27.720
Wang Dapu

31:28.680 --> 31:30.039
He is Chen Jiaping

31:30.519 --> 31:32.319
He will live with you from now on

31:32.799 --> 31:34.720
You should be nicer to him

31:40.599 --> 31:41.519
Welcome

31:47.880 --> 31:48.880
My name is Wang Dapu

31:50.799 --> 31:51.759
Chen Jiaping

32:02.000 --> 32:03.759
What do you think of this movie?

32:04.400 --> 32:05.319
The plot is boring

32:05.319 --> 32:06.160
slow pace

32:06.160 --> 32:07.039
Acting artificial

32:08.000 --> 32:09.559
Who would spend money to watch this kind of crappy movie?

32:09.559 --> 32:10.440
that is

32:10.799 --> 32:12.359
No wonder today’s movie tickets

32:12.359 --> 32:13.799
Not only is it free

32:13.799 --> 32:16.000
And as long as you enter the theater

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
Not leaving the table midway

32:17.000 --> 32:18.440
You can still get a dollar for nothing

32:19.039 --> 32:21.440
This is a completely bad movie

32:22.440 --> 32:23.480
I'm coming here

32:23.480 --> 32:24.839
Just came here for Du Fei

32:24.839 --> 32:27.720
But he was only out for a minute

32:28.279 --> 32:29.000
from beginning to end

32:29.000 --> 32:30.559
I just looked at Han Lu’s face

32:31.039 --> 32:32.720
dangling on the screen

32:32.720 --> 32:33.920
It's so annoying

32:34.240 --> 32:36.480
What do you think Han Lu is capable of?

32:37.039 --> 32:39.440
So many popular stars have matched her

32:39.640 --> 32:40.480
Behind this

32:40.480 --> 32:42.440
There must be a big boss who is favoring her.

32:42.599 --> 32:43.440
Yeah

32:43.440 --> 32:45.000
I just heard the person sitting next to me say

32:45.279 --> 32:46.359
This movie theater today

32:46.680 --> 32:48.920
Almost no one comes in with a ticket.

32:49.720 --> 32:50.279
real

32:50.279 --> 32:51.519
Ninety percent

32:51.519 --> 32:53.359
They are all here to act as trustees like us.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.079
I guess

32:55.079 --> 32:57.200
This is what the big boss spent

32:57.200 --> 32:59.319
Just to make Hanlu happy

32:59.839 --> 33:00.839
you do not say

33:00.839 --> 33:01.839
let's go

33:01.839 --> 33:02.680
Hurry up and get the money

33:02.920 --> 33:03.880
It's too late anymore

33:04.200 --> 33:04.880
OK OK OK

33:04.880 --> 33:05.559
wait for me wait for me wait for me

33:11.960 --> 33:14.559
Many people came to today's press conference

33:15.119 --> 33:16.000
Very grand

33:24.279 --> 33:24.799
I

33:26.039 --> 33:27.240
I don't want to go

33:28.960 --> 33:30.559
I came here just to tell you

33:31.279 --> 33:32.319
I'm a little tired

33:33.240 --> 33:34.440
Want to go back and rest

33:34.559 --> 33:35.359
Miss Hanlu

33:36.200 --> 33:38.000
Today's press conference

33:38.079 --> 33:39.440
You'd better show up

33:39.920 --> 33:41.880
Because I have something very important

33:42.319 --> 33:44.359
To be announced in front of all reporters

33:44.839 --> 33:48.880
Something about you and me

33:51.240 --> 33:52.039
whats the matter

33:54.960 --> 33:58.400
I want to do it in front of all the reporters

33:59.119 --> 34:00.279
propose to you

34:02.240 --> 34:03.519
my sincerity towards you

34:03.759 --> 34:04.920
I think you know

34:06.519 --> 34:06.920
No

34:07.279 --> 34:08.360
Mr. Yamashita

34:08.960 --> 34:09.800
sorry

34:10.679 --> 34:10.960
I

34:10.960 --> 34:11.960
Miss Hanlu

34:13.400 --> 34:15.559
I don't like forcing you

34:15.960 --> 34:16.880
Is this good?

34:17.880 --> 34:19.280
Think about it first

34:19.679 --> 34:20.360
And me

34:20.960 --> 34:22.239
Go deal with the reporters

34:29.079 --> 34:30.199
I'll wait for you to come over

34:54.320 --> 34:55.239
Miss Hanlu

34:55.840 --> 34:57.639
Did you know that Jiang Zhaoguo was arrested?

34:58.559 --> 34:59.280
What did you say

34:59.559 --> 35:00.920
I think you've guessed it

35:01.159 --> 35:03.400
Mr. Yamashita is not an ordinary businessman

35:04.000 --> 35:05.280
He is working for the Japanese Empire

35:05.480 --> 35:06.920
do something great

35:07.320 --> 35:09.199
He is a very powerful man

35:09.960 --> 35:12.920
As long as Miss Hanlu is willing to marry Mr. Yamashita

35:13.239 --> 35:15.440
he can do anything for you

35:18.360 --> 35:19.360
Miss Hanlu

35:20.320 --> 35:22.039
only you now

35:22.239 --> 35:24.960
Only then can Jiang Zhaoguo's life be saved.

35:25.440 --> 35:26.800
you can think about it

35:27.119 --> 35:28.760
But time is running out

35:29.199 --> 35:31.840
Mr. Yamashita and the reporters are still waiting.

35:55.159 --> 35:57.000
I'll ask you one last time

35:57.400 --> 35:58.920
Do you have anything else to say?

36:01.400 --> 36:03.920
I already told you the identity of the five of hearts.

36:04.159 --> 36:05.320
you know very well

36:05.800 --> 36:07.880
we want more than that

36:17.360 --> 36:19.239
What is your mission in Shanghai?

36:19.239 --> 36:21.920
Why are you so interested in the CCP’s side currency?

36:27.239 --> 36:28.039
good

36:30.039 --> 36:30.760
I said

36:46.000 --> 36:46.920
Boss Dai

36:48.480 --> 36:49.880
Arranged two agents

36:51.960 --> 36:55.039
The financial system lurking in the CCP’s border areas

36:55.960 --> 36:58.719
The codenames are Magpie and Dayan.

36:59.719 --> 37:02.760
before their identities are revealed

37:03.239 --> 37:06.320
They've got the recipe for edge paper

37:06.320 --> 37:07.400
Hebian coin copper plate

37:09.119 --> 37:10.840
Then they fled Yan'an

37:10.840 --> 37:10.880
Then they fled Yan'an

37:12.360 --> 37:13.800
I come to Shanghai this time

37:14.599 --> 37:16.199
Just to meet them

37:17.119 --> 37:19.280
Bring these two things back to Chongqing

37:19.880 --> 37:21.599
What do you want these things for?

37:23.639 --> 37:26.880
The Chongqing government has launched a

37:27.960 --> 37:32.119
Counterfeiting border currency to destroy the CCP’s border economy

37:32.760 --> 37:33.920
secret plan

37:34.519 --> 37:37.840
Magpie is the person I want to meet at the Majestic Hotel

37:39.079 --> 37:40.960
I was followed by your people at that time

37:41.920 --> 37:43.519
So we didn't meet

37:44.000 --> 37:44.719
later

37:46.639 --> 37:48.079
He died mysteriously

37:49.760 --> 37:52.840
I didn't get the recipe for edge paper either.

37:53.440 --> 37:54.440
What about the wild geese?

37:54.719 --> 37:55.880
The wild goose is missing

37:57.400 --> 37:58.639
Haven't been able to contact him

38:44.519 --> 38:46.360
Help

38:52.639 --> 38:54.679
Help

38:56.440 --> 38:58.320
Sir, help me

38:59.880 --> 39:00.360
What's wrong

39:00.559 --> 39:01.679
sir sir

39:01.920 --> 39:03.000
Help, help, help

39:03.159 --> 39:04.719
He wants to cut my nose

39:05.039 --> 39:06.599
my nose is gone

39:08.800 --> 39:10.199
If you guessed correctly

39:14.239 --> 39:15.679
Do you want to jailbreak?

39:17.079 --> 39:18.719
I don't understand what you mean

39:23.440 --> 39:25.360
You made a total of six keys

39:25.639 --> 39:26.800
cell key

39:26.800 --> 39:27.639
corridor key

39:28.000 --> 39:30.079
There are also keys to each stairwell.

39:30.079 --> 39:30.840
Right

39:31.559 --> 39:33.480
I said why are you poking out people's eyes?

39:33.480 --> 39:34.719
Biting someone's ear?

39:35.239 --> 39:37.320
I just don’t want anyone to live with you

39:37.639 --> 39:39.039
I'll delay you in making the key.

39:45.360 --> 39:46.519
I'm curious

39:47.039 --> 39:48.440
How did you guess it?

39:49.840 --> 39:50.480
you tell me first

39:50.480 --> 39:51.760
how did you do it

39:52.440 --> 39:53.440
What do you think

39:58.840 --> 40:00.079
By observing

40:01.119 --> 40:02.719
The key in the Japanese soldier's waist

40:04.079 --> 40:05.760
Remember the shape of each key

40:06.920 --> 40:08.280
Then draw it

40:08.800 --> 40:09.519
Follow the picture

40:09.920 --> 40:11.119
Make the key again

40:11.960 --> 40:13.840
Where is this key material?

40:14.679 --> 40:16.960
It should be the metal hinge on this bed.

40:18.480 --> 40:20.159
I said my bed

40:20.679 --> 40:22.039
live shaky

40:23.760 --> 40:24.599
This is also another

40:24.599 --> 40:25.480
you don't want to be with anyone else

40:25.480 --> 40:26.920
Maybe the reason for living together?

40:27.679 --> 40:29.360
You are smarter than the previous few

40:30.960 --> 40:32.400
But one person is too smart

40:32.719 --> 40:33.960
Not necessarily a good thing

40:34.599 --> 40:37.119
All they might lose are their eyes and ears

40:37.840 --> 40:38.639
And you

40:39.639 --> 40:41.679
What is lost may be life

40:46.519 --> 40:47.639
No more keys

40:54.719 --> 40:55.639
Where is the key

40:56.039 --> 40:57.000
Look for it

40:57.719 --> 40:59.000
I've never left this house

40:59.400 --> 41:00.800
The key is still in the house

41:01.000 --> 41:01.960
give me the key

41:02.639 --> 41:03.599
put the knife down

41:13.840 --> 41:15.119
what on earth do you want

41:15.119 --> 41:16.400
I didn't think about it

41:17.239 --> 41:18.719
I just think when I go out

41:18.719 --> 41:19.519
Don't miss an eye

41:19.519 --> 41:20.559
missing ears

41:20.920 --> 41:22.440
Scare my wife again

41:22.719 --> 41:23.840
give me the key

41:24.480 --> 41:25.559
I can't move you

41:26.800 --> 41:28.400
Why should I believe you?

41:32.519 --> 41:34.400
How do you agree to give me the key?

41:37.679 --> 41:38.760
Wait until I get out

41:39.239 --> 41:40.960
I'll give you the key when I get out

41:42.920 --> 41:43.519
no

41:44.039 --> 41:45.199
I don't have enough time

41:45.480 --> 41:46.760
I have to escape tomorrow

41:47.480 --> 41:49.360
Why does it have to be tomorrow?

41:50.920 --> 41:52.920
There's a sympathy show tomorrow night

41:53.679 --> 41:54.599
that time

41:55.079 --> 41:56.639
The Japanese had the weakest defense

41:57.199 --> 41:58.599
That's the best time

42:01.599 --> 42:03.039
Then you might not be able to get out

42:03.400 --> 42:05.119
It's not time for me to leave yet

42:08.800 --> 42:09.840
give me the key

42:11.800 --> 42:13.159
I'll take you to escape with me

42:15.000 --> 42:16.079
I'll escape with you

42:16.079 --> 42:17.719
Are you kidding me?

42:17.719 --> 42:19.280
How could I go out with you?

42:19.519 --> 42:21.239
I was brought here unjustly

42:21.239 --> 42:23.159
After the investigation, I can release you.

42:23.559 --> 42:24.800
I'll run out with you

42:25.360 --> 42:27.039
I can't explain it even more clearly.

42:29.880 --> 42:31.039
this place

42:31.519 --> 42:33.039
I stayed longer than you

42:33.800 --> 42:35.159
I've only seen people coming in

42:35.800 --> 42:37.360
I've never seen anyone go out before
