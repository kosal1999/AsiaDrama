01:33.760 --> 01:36.200
Captain Zhao and the others arrested a CCP member

01:36.439 --> 01:37.120
died

01:37.359 --> 01:38.640
Let me transport it out and throw it away

01:39.280 --> 01:40.239
Tragic

01:49.359 --> 01:50.200
two knives

01:51.040 --> 01:52.239
what happened again

01:56.319 --> 01:56.920
etc.

01:58.439 --> 01:59.599
do you know

02:00.280 --> 02:01.480
Under the scorching sun

02:02.159 --> 02:03.319
Yang Qi prevails

02:04.599 --> 02:06.879
Ghosts will not find their way to the underworld

02:07.760 --> 02:09.280
What does it have to do with me that he can't find a way?

02:09.280 --> 02:10.719
Of course it has something to do with you

02:11.400 --> 02:12.520
He can't find the way

02:13.360 --> 02:15.000
They will pester the person who moved the body.

02:15.840 --> 02:17.639
Especially an innocent ghost like this who died tragically

02:18.479 --> 02:20.479
When the time comes, you won’t be able to get rid of me even if you want to.

02:20.919 --> 02:21.599
real

02:22.479 --> 02:23.719
So what should I do?

02:27.520 --> 02:29.240
You put a coin in his mouth

02:29.960 --> 02:31.439
If you have money, you can ask for directions.

02:32.919 --> 02:34.199
Makes sense

03:04.560 --> 03:05.240
Thanks

03:28.120 --> 03:29.039
This one

03:29.240 --> 03:31.960
It was given to me by the comrades who came from Yan'an today.

04:01.319 --> 04:02.120
old road

04:28.680 --> 04:29.759
Tomorrow morning

04:29.839 --> 04:32.319
I will talk to several people in charge of the intelligence station

04:32.399 --> 04:34.639
A meeting was held at Haibanxian Tea House to discuss this matter

04:35.279 --> 04:36.560
You should pay close attention tomorrow

04:36.560 --> 04:38.959
What’s going on at the trading house and the military police headquarters?

04:39.040 --> 04:40.959
Carry out perimeter security work

04:49.240 --> 04:50.000
boarding

04:50.160 --> 04:50.759
Walk

05:13.160 --> 05:14.399
How many bosses are you?

05:14.680 --> 05:16.399
I made an appointment with a friend to talk about something in the private room upstairs

05:16.439 --> 05:17.800
Okay, please come in

05:19.319 --> 05:20.319
Boss Lu

05:21.680 --> 05:23.680
I've finally found you

05:28.160 --> 05:28.839
Captain Zhao

05:29.199 --> 05:30.079
why are you here

05:30.160 --> 05:30.920
come over

05:33.399 --> 05:35.360
We met Chen Jiaping at the calligraphy and painting shop.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.160
Then I followed him here.

05:38.600 --> 05:39.319
team leader

05:39.839 --> 05:41.240
Do you want to rush in right now?

05:41.399 --> 05:42.879
Arrest Lao Lu and his accomplices

05:42.879 --> 05:44.360
The old path is the Communist Party

05:44.920 --> 05:46.360
But meeting him for tea

05:46.399 --> 05:47.800
Not necessarily a communist

05:48.079 --> 05:49.439
If you act rashly

05:49.720 --> 05:51.279
All the hard work is in vain.

05:51.600 --> 05:52.720
The clues are gone

05:52.720 --> 05:55.319
The inkstone you sold me was actually a fake

05:55.800 --> 05:56.839
And closed the store

05:56.839 --> 05:57.480
What's wrong

05:57.680 --> 05:59.079
Are you afraid that I will find you?

05:59.439 --> 06:00.079
Mr. Chen

06:00.079 --> 06:02.120
What do I do for an inkstone?

06:02.839 --> 06:03.639
I have something to do today

06:03.639 --> 06:04.759
I made an appointment with a few friends to talk up there.

06:04.759 --> 06:05.279
All right

06:05.279 --> 06:06.000
I'll go up first

06:07.120 --> 06:07.680
It's okay to talk

06:07.680 --> 06:08.319
what are you doing

06:08.920 --> 06:10.319
There seems to be something wrong over there on the old road.

06:10.519 --> 06:11.480
Should we evacuate?

06:11.680 --> 06:12.439
There's a spy at the door

06:12.439 --> 06:13.439
Destroy files immediately

06:13.879 --> 06:14.800
Kobeko Agawa

06:14.800 --> 06:16.240
You will go to the teahouse in a moment

06:16.600 --> 06:17.519
Optimistic about the old road

06:17.720 --> 06:18.879
Where exactly?

06:19.199 --> 06:20.959
There are also several people who met

06:22.079 --> 06:22.639
team leader

06:22.639 --> 06:23.040
Out

06:23.040 --> 06:24.399
You give me the money for the inkstone

06:24.399 --> 06:25.959
Let’s talk however we want

06:26.480 --> 06:26.920
Not Mr. Chen

06:26.920 --> 06:29.160
I don’t have that much money with me now.

06:29.240 --> 06:30.000
no problem

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
You go in my car

06:31.000 --> 06:32.199
Go to your store and get money

06:32.360 --> 06:33.319
Not your car

06:33.480 --> 06:33.959
yes

06:34.000 --> 06:34.480
Mr. Chen

06:34.480 --> 06:35.600
You are also my regular customer

06:36.199 --> 06:37.560
There is some basic trust between us

06:37.560 --> 06:37.879
All gone

06:37.879 --> 06:38.639
seems to be quarreling

06:39.519 --> 06:41.079
Chen Jiaping knew that the old road was exposed

06:41.519 --> 06:42.839
He is here to save Lao Lu

06:42.959 --> 06:44.639
Now you are a cunning old man

06:45.079 --> 06:45.879
Hurry up and don't say anything

06:45.879 --> 06:46.360
boarding

06:46.360 --> 06:46.879
take the money

06:46.879 --> 06:48.079
Why are you like this?

06:48.079 --> 06:48.519
team leader

06:48.759 --> 06:50.199
If you don't take action, it will be too late.

06:50.680 --> 06:52.000
Maybe it's to lure the tiger away from the mountain

06:52.560 --> 06:53.639
Want to lure us away

06:53.920 --> 06:54.560
do not forget

06:54.959 --> 06:56.439
There are communists in the teahouse

06:57.000 --> 06:58.600
They want the communists to

06:58.879 --> 07:00.079
Have a chance to escape

07:00.519 --> 07:01.079
trunk

07:01.160 --> 07:03.160
How many people can you take to follow Chen Jiaping and Lao Lu?

07:03.160 --> 07:03.839
yes

07:03.839 --> 07:04.920
Agawa Kazukobeiko

07:04.920 --> 07:05.519
Come with me

07:30.480 --> 07:32.040
Are you sure about the comrade who died?

07:32.439 --> 07:33.560
Smoking big leaf tobacco

07:33.839 --> 07:34.560
That's right

07:35.920 --> 07:36.959
your joint

07:37.439 --> 07:38.839
They are all under Zhao An's surveillance

07:39.199 --> 07:41.279
Your identity has been exposed now

07:41.480 --> 07:42.800
The reason why I didn’t arrest you right away

07:42.920 --> 07:44.959
I want you to attract more comrades

07:49.800 --> 07:50.879
Are you from Zhao An?

07:54.000 --> 07:54.560
right

07:54.879 --> 07:56.000
Lure them away first

08:00.800 --> 08:01.240
Hurry up

08:01.240 --> 08:01.959
follow him

08:08.879 --> 08:10.040
Follow, follow, follow

08:27.720 --> 08:28.360
old road

08:29.079 --> 08:30.560
you have to leave shanghai

08:35.200 --> 08:35.759
But I'm leaving

08:35.759 --> 08:37.240
Your identity is exposed

08:38.960 --> 08:39.559
I

08:41.039 --> 08:41.960
I'm just you

08:42.279 --> 08:43.360
Frequent customer of calligraphy and painting shop

08:43.799 --> 08:44.919
I bought a fake inkstone

08:45.320 --> 08:46.000
Just happened to bump into you

08:46.039 --> 08:46.720
Looking for your theory

08:46.840 --> 08:48.000
I want you to return the money to me

08:48.440 --> 08:49.360
this drama

08:50.039 --> 08:51.279
I can still continue to act in this play

08:51.519 --> 08:53.440
But you didn’t follow me back to the calligraphy and painting shop

08:54.159 --> 08:55.279
I suddenly disappeared

08:55.279 --> 08:56.600
how do you explain

08:58.080 --> 08:59.000
You arrived at the teahouse

08:59.480 --> 09:00.600
Found someone following you

09:00.879 --> 09:02.960
I appeared when I was at a loss

09:03.240 --> 09:05.159
You took the opportunity to leave the teahouse with me

09:05.600 --> 09:07.320
The most I can do is be used by you

09:09.120 --> 09:09.600
Far-fetched

09:09.600 --> 09:10.480
Too far-fetched

09:11.720 --> 09:12.840
Luo Guanqun

09:13.639 --> 09:14.679
I'm afraid in the future

09:15.120 --> 09:16.399
I won't trust you anymore

09:17.799 --> 09:19.480
Let’s talk about what happens next.

09:19.480 --> 09:20.120
ok

09:20.399 --> 09:22.320
There is a steamed stuffed bun shop in front of this intersection.

09:22.679 --> 09:23.519
I know the boss there

09:23.519 --> 09:24.639
He can vouch for me

09:25.200 --> 09:26.360
I put you down there

09:29.399 --> 09:31.600
Which private room was the person we had an argument with just now was in?

09:31.919 --> 09:32.840
I don't know either

09:32.960 --> 09:34.080
He just went up the stairs

09:34.320 --> 09:35.799
I was stopped by another guest.

09:35.799 --> 09:37.279
The two talked for a while

09:37.440 --> 09:38.440
It started quarreling

09:39.200 --> 09:40.639
Are all your private rooms upstairs?

09:40.639 --> 09:41.120
yes

09:51.679 --> 09:52.200
I mean Boss Lu

09:52.240 --> 09:53.559
Why did you ask me to stop here?

09:53.679 --> 09:54.960
Why don't you go to your store?

09:55.159 --> 09:55.799
Not Mr. Chen

09:55.799 --> 09:56.840
You lose such a temper

09:56.840 --> 09:57.799
You want to come to my store

09:57.799 --> 09:59.440
How do I do this business?

09:59.720 --> 10:01.279
You think about your business now

10:01.279 --> 10:02.679
When you sold me a fake inkstone

10:02.679 --> 10:03.840
Why don't you want to

10:04.799 --> 10:05.679
Boss Cao, let me ask you

10:06.039 --> 10:07.600
If someone eats something bad at your place

10:07.639 --> 10:08.559
Do you pay or not?

10:08.960 --> 10:10.320
I'll definitely have to pay for it.

10:10.679 --> 10:11.200
Did you look at it?

10:11.440 --> 10:11.919
lose money

10:11.960 --> 10:12.360
Come

10:12.360 --> 10:13.279
Mr. Chen Mr. Chen

10:13.600 --> 10:14.200
help

10:14.200 --> 10:15.080
Don't go to my store

10:15.279 --> 10:15.840
I promise

10:16.039 --> 10:17.600
I'll go to the store immediately and get the money

10:17.639 --> 10:18.399
Sent to you

10:18.759 --> 10:19.840
Where can you find me?

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
where you work

10:21.000 --> 10:21.600
I I know

10:21.639 --> 10:22.440
I've been there

10:22.840 --> 10:24.080
I mean Boss Lu

10:24.919 --> 10:26.480
Stop playing tricks on me

10:27.039 --> 10:28.159
I promise I promise

10:31.000 --> 10:31.679
rest assured

10:36.559 --> 10:37.159
Mr. Chen

10:37.159 --> 10:37.840
What's the matter?

10:38.879 --> 10:39.720
Nothing

10:40.240 --> 10:41.360
Sell ​​me a fake inkstone

10:42.000 --> 10:42.720
How is business?

10:43.200 --> 10:44.039
so-so

10:52.960 --> 10:54.200
How many private rooms are there in total?

10:54.559 --> 10:56.679
Twelve private rooms in total

10:58.360 --> 10:59.440
Are all seats full?

11:00.279 --> 11:01.879
All eight rooms have guests.

11:04.480 --> 11:05.840
There are private rooms on both sides

11:27.639 --> 11:28.679
Smells of smoke

11:29.720 --> 11:31.240
A guest smokes

11:31.399 --> 11:32.240
very normal

11:33.559 --> 11:35.039
Not the smell of cigarette smoke

11:39.759 --> 11:40.279
Yeah

11:40.600 --> 11:41.440
Received yet

11:42.080 --> 11:42.720
Like it

11:42.919 --> 11:43.480
Su Jin's

11:43.480 --> 11:43.840
Miss

11:43.840 --> 11:44.440
can you hurry up

11:44.440 --> 11:45.159
I'm in a hurry

11:45.159 --> 11:45.639
you are in a hurry

11:45.639 --> 11:47.000
I have something urgent to do

11:48.799 --> 11:49.279
good

11:49.480 --> 11:50.000
Okay

11:50.440 --> 11:51.600
Then I'll hang up first

11:51.600 --> 11:52.679
There is something else to do today

11:56.639 --> 11:57.159
Thanks

12:08.919 --> 12:10.320
I'll leave it to you at home.

12:11.279 --> 12:12.879
Please be sure to contact your fourth brother

12:14.480 --> 12:15.000
OK

12:15.879 --> 12:16.480
goodbye

12:24.399 --> 12:24.799
stop

12:24.799 --> 12:25.559
Don't run

12:41.039 --> 12:41.840
Caught alive

13:16.360 --> 13:17.279
Caught alive

13:23.639 --> 13:24.200
Chase

13:26.799 --> 13:27.559
Chase

13:33.720 --> 13:34.240
Slow down

13:42.480 --> 13:43.320
You go over there and chase

13:43.440 --> 13:44.159
I go this way

13:44.159 --> 13:44.679
yes

14:54.000 --> 14:54.639
old road

14:56.360 --> 14:57.120
Go quickly, go quickly

14:59.679 --> 15:00.840
You can't run away

15:02.879 --> 15:03.679
take away

15:08.679 --> 15:10.159
Stand together in the same box

15:10.919 --> 15:11.600
Stand ready

15:11.600 --> 15:12.440
Stand ready

15:14.840 --> 15:15.879
team leader

15:23.879 --> 15:24.679
Where is the old road?

15:27.000 --> 15:27.919
Got it

15:28.200 --> 15:29.279
Not caught either

15:30.080 --> 15:31.039
what does it mean

15:31.360 --> 15:32.039
Caught

15:32.240 --> 15:33.600
But it wasn't our people who caught him

15:33.799 --> 15:34.639
who caught

15:35.759 --> 15:36.600
large spoon

15:38.159 --> 15:39.320
large spoon

15:39.679 --> 15:41.240
I was about to catch someone

15:41.519 --> 15:43.159
As a result, Damasao suddenly appeared halfway.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.480
Take away the old road

15:44.519 --> 15:45.720
Why is he following the old path?

15:46.120 --> 15:48.320
He said he found out that Lao Lu was a communist

15:48.320 --> 15:50.320
How could he know about Lao Lu?

15:50.639 --> 15:51.000
this

15:51.519 --> 15:52.320
I don't know either

15:58.639 --> 15:59.600
Where is Chen Jiaping?

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Lost a section in the middle

16:01.200 --> 16:02.759
Later, when we met the old road again,

16:02.879 --> 16:04.399
Chen Jiaping has disappeared

16:07.039 --> 16:08.120
I really didn't expect it

16:09.440 --> 16:11.240
My pen, ink, paper and inkstone

16:12.039 --> 16:14.360
It turned out to be provided by a Communist Party member.

16:16.080 --> 16:17.639
These are all good things

16:18.840 --> 16:20.240
It's just in your hands

16:21.240 --> 16:23.039
What I drew was artificial.

16:23.679 --> 16:25.159
Flattery trash

16:26.600 --> 16:27.879
Really like the painting

16:29.159 --> 16:30.679
What a pity

16:35.159 --> 16:36.159
stop wasting time

16:36.799 --> 16:38.000
do your tricks

16:38.679 --> 16:39.320
torture

16:39.720 --> 16:40.360
torture

16:40.720 --> 16:41.440
Use them all

16:43.200 --> 16:43.799
let's start

16:50.000 --> 16:51.519
Mr. Lu is a cultural person

16:53.000 --> 16:54.440
I wouldn't do that to you

17:01.919 --> 17:03.639
Meat that has been stewed for so many days

17:04.480 --> 17:05.319
stewed

17:05.640 --> 17:07.200
I can smell the meaty aroma

17:07.880 --> 17:08.799
The meat is gone

17:09.480 --> 17:10.039
team leader

17:10.400 --> 17:11.319
What should we do now

17:15.079 --> 17:16.759
The old road lies in Luo Guanqun's hands

17:17.160 --> 17:18.279
once confessed

17:19.160 --> 17:20.759
Communists in the teahouse

17:21.000 --> 17:22.759
They will take it away in one fell swoop

17:23.880 --> 17:25.559
Before we confess

17:26.319 --> 17:27.720
Uncover these communist parties

17:27.920 --> 17:29.599
This is our last hope

17:29.799 --> 17:30.240
yes

17:37.400 --> 17:38.319
what did you find

17:41.440 --> 17:41.920
good

17:43.240 --> 17:44.000
I see

17:52.440 --> 17:54.759
We went to Yumo calligraphy and painting shop

17:58.680 --> 18:00.440
Just rummage and find it

18:00.960 --> 18:01.799
Someone likes it

18:02.240 --> 18:02.799
I send you

18:05.960 --> 18:07.559
I really found what I like

18:10.359 --> 18:12.400
That's my Huanhua paper

18:12.400 --> 18:13.920
Or Longxiang Yumo?

18:16.119 --> 18:16.799
Not to mention

18:17.720 --> 18:19.640
None of these are what I like.

18:36.799 --> 18:39.079
All of us are here to drink tea.

18:39.559 --> 18:41.440
Why are you drinking?

18:41.440 --> 18:42.559
It's against the law to drink too much

18:42.559 --> 18:43.400
That's right

18:43.400 --> 18:45.640
I didn’t let you speak, so I shut my mouth.

18:45.880 --> 18:46.880
Don't shut up

18:47.200 --> 18:48.759
Let you add more sin to sin

18:58.039 --> 18:58.799
Captain Zhao

18:59.279 --> 19:01.279
Tea patrons in the eight private rooms on the second floor

19:01.279 --> 19:02.039
It's all here

19:03.599 --> 19:04.839
Have you checked everything?

19:05.119 --> 19:05.880
Checked

19:06.240 --> 19:07.359
I also searched them one by one.

19:07.599 --> 19:09.160
No clues found

19:24.400 --> 19:26.559
The Communist Party is among you

19:28.119 --> 19:29.759
Let me tell you the truth

19:30.839 --> 19:33.119
Lao Lu has been arrested by us

19:34.599 --> 19:36.079
who are his accomplices

19:36.599 --> 19:38.359
Take the initiative to stand up

19:39.119 --> 19:41.640
I'm giving you a chance to confess your own sins.

19:42.880 --> 19:44.319
Take the initiative to plead guilty

19:44.599 --> 19:46.279
We will forget about it

19:46.680 --> 19:47.960
You guys think clearly

19:48.759 --> 19:50.240
Even if you don’t admit it now

19:50.559 --> 19:51.480
old road

19:52.559 --> 19:54.119
Will confess soon

19:54.680 --> 19:56.200
And come and identify you

19:58.279 --> 19:59.400
stand out

20:00.640 --> 20:01.680
You just checked

20:01.680 --> 20:03.359
Who do you think is the most suspect?

20:06.079 --> 20:06.720
these two

20:06.759 --> 20:07.960
I just wanted to jump out of the window and escape

20:09.680 --> 20:10.680
why run away

20:11.400 --> 20:12.160
us

20:13.680 --> 20:14.799
You are waiting for the old road

20:15.160 --> 20:16.240
You are a communist

20:16.480 --> 20:16.960
no

20:17.519 --> 20:18.759
What an old road

20:18.880 --> 20:20.440
We don't even know this person

20:20.440 --> 20:22.039
Why run away

20:24.960 --> 20:25.519
Xiaolan

20:25.839 --> 20:26.480
Xiaolan

20:28.720 --> 20:29.359
Secretary

20:29.960 --> 20:31.359
Let me tell you the truth

20:31.880 --> 20:32.480
I

20:32.920 --> 20:34.920
I am a married man

20:35.039 --> 20:36.599
She is a married woman

20:36.599 --> 20:38.519
We secretly came out to meet each other.

20:38.519 --> 20:39.880
As for what you are looking for

20:39.880 --> 20:40.880
We don't know either

20:40.880 --> 20:42.720
We are afraid of being discovered by others

20:42.720 --> 20:44.039
So we have to jump out of the window and escape.

20:44.319 --> 20:45.079
you are lying

20:45.079 --> 20:46.240
You are the Communist Party

20:47.480 --> 20:48.279
I swear

20:48.279 --> 20:49.599
I'm really not

20:50.000 --> 20:50.640
Secretary

20:50.839 --> 20:52.359
You can't accuse me wrongly

20:53.839 --> 20:54.519
Captain Zhao

20:54.519 --> 20:55.279
There are clues

20:55.279 --> 20:55.920
explain

20:56.119 --> 20:58.319
I just discovered that there are three tea guests in Haiyue Hall

20:58.319 --> 21:00.079
But they asked for four tea sets

21:01.440 --> 21:02.240
Haiyue Hall

21:02.400 --> 21:03.119
Yes

21:04.880 --> 21:06.200
People from Haiyue Hall

21:07.599 --> 21:10.039
Who is the person in the private room of Haiyue Hall?

21:10.039 --> 21:11.359
Who is from Haiyue Hall?

21:12.480 --> 21:13.960
Let me ask one last question

21:14.759 --> 21:16.680
Who is the guest of Haiyue Hall?

21:16.680 --> 21:17.519
stand out

21:18.039 --> 21:20.160
How many of us are

21:21.279 --> 21:22.240
You are a communist

21:22.720 --> 21:23.920
You are waiting for the old road

21:23.920 --> 21:25.200
we are waiting for a friend

21:25.200 --> 21:26.079
His name is Guan Dajiang

21:26.079 --> 21:27.279
He's a fur trader

21:28.599 --> 21:30.440
You are just waiting for the old road

21:30.440 --> 21:31.640
You are the Communist Party

21:31.720 --> 21:33.079
We are really not the Communist Party

21:33.079 --> 21:33.720
Secretary

21:33.720 --> 21:35.400
You need to have evidence for what you say.

21:38.599 --> 21:39.400
it's him

21:39.400 --> 21:40.799
He is Guan Dajiang

21:42.640 --> 21:43.720
who are you

21:44.440 --> 21:45.880
I'm in the fur business

21:45.880 --> 21:47.279
I made an appointment with some colleagues today

21:47.279 --> 21:48.240
Come over for tea and chat

21:48.240 --> 21:50.000
I was temporarily delayed because of something else.

21:50.000 --> 21:50.839
Come a little late

21:50.839 --> 21:52.640
I saw a closing sign hanging outside.

21:52.640 --> 21:54.599
I just said come in and see what's going on.

21:54.960 --> 21:55.759
you lied

21:56.160 --> 21:57.079
You are a communist

21:57.680 --> 21:59.440
I'm in the fur business

21:59.440 --> 22:00.759
you are all lying

22:01.440 --> 22:03.359
You are all communists

22:03.359 --> 22:04.000
Secretary

22:04.000 --> 22:05.880
My store is at No. 355 Daxi Road

22:05.880 --> 22:06.960
If you don’t believe it, you can check it out.

22:06.960 --> 22:07.720
Check it out

22:07.960 --> 22:09.720
You are all communists

22:09.720 --> 22:10.720
Brother, calm down

22:10.720 --> 22:11.759
what are you doing

22:11.960 --> 22:13.680
Luo Guanqun is racing with me

22:13.799 --> 22:14.920
I can't lose

22:14.920 --> 22:15.680
check

22:15.680 --> 22:16.279
elder brother

22:17.039 --> 22:18.000
I figured out a way

22:18.680 --> 22:19.519
I have a way

22:22.160 --> 22:24.240
Mr. Lu is really rigorous in his work.

22:24.720 --> 22:26.599
Didn't give us any clues

22:27.079 --> 22:29.079
But it’s a matter of distance.

22:29.759 --> 22:32.279
These documents reveal your secret

22:33.480 --> 22:34.880
we investigated

22:34.880 --> 22:36.119
you live alone

22:36.839 --> 22:38.039
Food and accommodation are all in the store

22:38.799 --> 22:39.519
But

22:40.160 --> 22:41.759
You bring some daily necessities

22:41.759 --> 22:43.079
Send to this address

22:43.559 --> 22:44.599
what do you want to say

22:46.319 --> 22:47.680
you have family

22:49.359 --> 22:51.000
Because of your work and tasks

22:51.160 --> 22:52.680
Are you afraid of causing trouble to your family?

22:53.039 --> 22:54.680
You care about them silently

22:55.119 --> 22:58.319
So you send all these things to them

23:00.480 --> 23:01.440
i have no family

23:02.279 --> 23:04.279
No. 78 Luban Road

23:04.720 --> 23:05.799
Very easy to find

23:06.200 --> 23:07.279
What do you want to do

23:08.599 --> 23:09.079
this

23:10.480 --> 23:11.880
A pair of tiger head cotton shoes

23:12.519 --> 23:13.880
Half a catty of sweet-scented osmanthus sugar cake

23:15.640 --> 23:17.160
There is also a toy car

23:17.799 --> 23:19.559
These are all for children, right?

23:22.240 --> 23:23.240
How old is the child?

23:23.960 --> 23:24.839
cute

23:25.559 --> 23:26.799
Don't touch them

23:29.400 --> 23:30.759
they are innocent

23:35.440 --> 23:36.039
good

23:37.480 --> 23:39.480
Then let’s go back to the previous topic

23:41.119 --> 23:42.759
Are you still saying nothing?

23:43.640 --> 23:44.880
Have you thought it through?

23:51.440 --> 23:52.920
Stretch out your hands

24:09.440 --> 24:10.559
Why are you shaking?

24:28.960 --> 24:30.720
Why are there burnt colors on your fingers?

24:30.880 --> 24:32.519
I smoked for twenty years

24:32.599 --> 24:34.079
This finger is yellowed

24:34.359 --> 24:35.079
It's normal

24:35.400 --> 24:35.960
wrong

24:36.880 --> 24:37.880
Not the smell of smoking

24:38.640 --> 24:39.920
Did you burn the file?

24:39.920 --> 24:40.480
No

24:40.920 --> 24:42.079
I've been drinking tea

24:42.839 --> 24:44.039
I'll ask you one last time

24:44.440 --> 24:45.440
Are you a communist?

24:45.559 --> 24:46.519
This officer

24:46.640 --> 24:49.160
You say that everyone you meet is a communist without any evidence.

24:49.559 --> 24:50.720
Which unit do you belong to?

24:51.319 --> 24:53.160
This is your idea

24:56.240 --> 24:57.000
very nice

24:59.400 --> 25:00.599
Which unit?

25:01.240 --> 25:02.960
We are the Military Police Headquarters

25:03.480 --> 25:05.680
Specifically to catch you Communists

25:05.839 --> 25:06.359
OK

25:06.920 --> 25:08.519
Take me to the Military Police Headquarters

25:09.160 --> 25:11.079
Do you think I dare not?

25:12.440 --> 25:13.480
Bring back

25:13.839 --> 25:15.200
torture

25:15.200 --> 25:15.759
yes

25:20.200 --> 25:21.079
Captain Zhao

25:21.319 --> 25:22.279
Busy now

25:24.400 --> 25:25.480
Why is Manager Luo here?

25:26.960 --> 25:28.440
I heard you caught the Communists

25:28.599 --> 25:29.680
Let me take a look

25:30.440 --> 25:31.039
right

25:31.839 --> 25:32.720
Checking

25:33.119 --> 25:34.240
Found out immediately

25:34.599 --> 25:35.640
Got a clue

25:38.039 --> 25:40.480
he he he

25:41.039 --> 25:42.279
All suspected

25:43.480 --> 25:44.880
Do you doubt this gentleman?

25:45.559 --> 25:46.599
I have evidence

25:47.839 --> 25:49.319
do you know who he is

25:51.279 --> 25:52.119
Boss Cheng

25:52.880 --> 25:54.480
An irresistible friend of the boss

25:54.880 --> 25:57.359
Controls half of Shanghai's cotton yarn business

25:57.920 --> 25:59.240
gendarmerie headquarters

25:59.519 --> 26:00.759
All treated as honored guests

26:01.640 --> 26:03.440
Always behave in a low-key manner

26:04.200 --> 26:05.640
You said he is the Chinese Communist Party

26:06.160 --> 26:07.839
This commander is too unreasonable.

26:07.920 --> 26:09.880
I couldn't help but call Boss Cheng.

26:13.440 --> 26:13.880
Excuse me

26:13.880 --> 26:14.839
I'm blind

26:16.200 --> 26:18.119
I am here to investigate the communists

26:18.640 --> 26:19.319
How about this

26:20.119 --> 26:21.519
You do it in front of Boss Cheng

26:21.640 --> 26:23.240
Slap yourself ten times

26:26.000 --> 26:26.839
Forget it

26:33.720 --> 26:34.200
how

26:34.640 --> 26:35.319
Don't want to fight

26:37.240 --> 26:38.240
Then I'll call Kimura.

26:38.240 --> 26:40.240
Give a review to Boss Cheng

26:55.559 --> 26:56.680
satisfied

26:58.279 --> 26:59.000
Boss Cheng

26:59.440 --> 27:00.200
satisfied

27:01.039 --> 27:03.079
I'm talking to a friend about something private

27:03.240 --> 27:04.440
Unable to identify myself

27:04.720 --> 27:06.319
No wonder this brother

27:06.480 --> 27:07.039
Boss Cheng

27:07.680 --> 27:08.759
Your Excellency a lot

27:09.599 --> 27:10.960
Can we go then?

27:10.960 --> 27:11.519
certainly

27:11.519 --> 27:11.960
Come

27:12.160 --> 27:13.440
Boss Cheng is wronged

27:13.720 --> 27:14.079
Come

27:14.720 --> 27:15.160
open the door

27:18.400 --> 27:19.960
Let all these people go

27:19.960 --> 27:20.799
Can't let go

27:20.880 --> 27:21.880
Continue to check

27:22.119 --> 27:23.160
No need for you to check

27:24.680 --> 27:25.799
Which two

27:26.440 --> 27:27.640
It's from Dongli Hall

27:29.000 --> 27:29.880
Shopkeeper

27:33.440 --> 27:34.119
these two

27:35.759 --> 27:36.519
large spoon

27:37.039 --> 27:38.680
Take these two people away from me

27:38.680 --> 27:39.640
They are the Chinese Communist Party

27:39.759 --> 27:40.279
No

27:40.400 --> 27:41.119
We are not the CCP

27:41.119 --> 27:41.720
not us

27:41.720 --> 27:42.000
right

27:42.000 --> 27:42.440
you made a mistake

27:42.440 --> 27:43.319
It's really not us

27:43.319 --> 27:44.319
We are not the Communist Party

27:44.319 --> 27:45.079
Catch

27:45.079 --> 27:45.440
yes

27:45.440 --> 27:46.079
take away

27:46.079 --> 27:46.759
You are mistaken

27:46.759 --> 27:47.400
Wrong arrest

27:48.160 --> 27:49.160
It's really not us

27:49.519 --> 27:50.240
Got it wrong

27:50.720 --> 27:51.480
You are mistaken

27:51.480 --> 27:52.839
It's really not us

27:53.039 --> 27:53.759
Secretary

27:54.519 --> 27:56.799
How do you know they are the Chinese Communist Party?

27:57.079 --> 27:58.400
how could I know

27:58.960 --> 28:00.279
Do I need to tell you?

28:01.920 --> 28:04.480
The old road is the goal I have been following for a long time

28:05.079 --> 28:06.279
Even if you catch him

28:06.440 --> 28:07.240
this case

28:07.759 --> 28:09.720
The two of us are working together, right?

28:11.279 --> 28:12.960
You work in the stable

28:13.480 --> 28:15.279
What should I cooperate with you for?

28:21.079 --> 28:22.000
Captain Zhao

28:23.599 --> 28:25.160
There's always something wrong with you

28:26.480 --> 28:28.799
Always touch things you shouldn't touch

28:30.079 --> 28:31.160
What a stinky problem

28:42.599 --> 28:43.279
team leader

28:44.400 --> 28:46.119
the rest of these people

28:46.119 --> 28:46.680
return

29:02.799 --> 29:03.480
All recruited

29:03.720 --> 29:04.319
All recruited

29:04.559 --> 29:05.680
One is named Chen Shaoxiong

29:05.680 --> 29:06.559
One is named Bai Yao

29:06.720 --> 29:08.200
At first, I kept insisting that

29:08.200 --> 29:09.319
He is a cigarette dealer

29:09.519 --> 29:11.160
Then gave them some torture

29:11.400 --> 29:12.559
Just recruit it

29:12.960 --> 29:14.680
I thought the Communist Party was so powerful

29:14.839 --> 29:15.359
This is not

29:15.359 --> 29:16.359
It’s also fleshy

29:16.359 --> 29:17.319
I also know it hurts

29:25.839 --> 29:26.599
Have you breathed your last?

29:27.319 --> 29:28.079
Haven't breathed out yet

29:28.880 --> 29:29.920
He must have fainted

29:36.640 --> 29:37.359
This is okay

29:37.759 --> 29:38.640
You ask him

29:41.480 --> 29:42.200
Chen Shaoxiong

29:42.559 --> 29:43.920
Are you a communist?

29:44.440 --> 29:45.079
do not hit me

29:45.640 --> 29:46.359
I said

29:47.039 --> 29:48.240
I am a communist

29:48.519 --> 29:50.039
I am a communist

29:52.440 --> 29:53.599
Do you know the old road?

29:53.920 --> 29:54.640
know

29:55.240 --> 29:56.079
know

29:56.079 --> 29:58.559
What are you doing at Haibanxian Teahouse?

29:59.079 --> 29:59.960
meeting

30:00.440 --> 30:01.279
meeting

30:01.440 --> 30:02.720
What meeting?

30:02.720 --> 30:03.920
What content

30:04.079 --> 30:04.759
I open

30:04.759 --> 30:06.519
Let me go, let me go

30:07.960 --> 30:09.359
louder

30:16.839 --> 30:17.880
A bit harsh

30:18.400 --> 30:19.359
Let him slow down

30:19.400 --> 30:20.599
Anyway, we have the people in our hands

30:21.039 --> 30:22.079
Recruited them all too

30:22.279 --> 30:23.160
Review slowly

30:35.519 --> 30:37.599
I always feel that there is something wrong with those two CCP

30:38.200 --> 30:39.079
Will not

30:39.240 --> 30:40.480
Lao Lu personally confessed

30:40.480 --> 30:42.359
They met in that Dongli Hall

30:42.759 --> 30:43.839
And he knows it very well

30:43.839 --> 30:44.640
If you lied to me

30:44.640 --> 30:46.160
His family is dead.

30:50.400 --> 30:50.720
Manager Luo

30:50.720 --> 30:51.680
I'll go down and take a look

30:54.839 --> 30:55.640
Go, go, go

30:56.279 --> 30:57.039
go away

30:58.720 --> 30:59.519
uncle

30:59.519 --> 31:00.680
please

31:00.839 --> 31:01.680
give some money

31:01.680 --> 31:02.720
let me take a sip

31:02.880 --> 31:03.920
Let me take a sip

31:04.359 --> 31:05.200
give some money

31:05.559 --> 31:06.440
Let me take a sip, uncle

31:06.440 --> 31:07.839
Please, sir

31:07.839 --> 31:09.519
Give me some money and let me take a sip

31:09.559 --> 31:10.680
Just one bite

31:11.160 --> 31:11.880
boarding

31:12.480 --> 31:13.440
Give me some money, sir

31:14.160 --> 31:15.160
Just one bite

31:15.440 --> 31:15.960
uncle

31:16.519 --> 31:17.440
Where to go boss?

31:17.480 --> 31:18.160
Back to the interrogation room

31:18.160 --> 31:18.640
good

31:19.559 --> 31:20.240
Just one bite

31:26.440 --> 31:27.200
Passed this intersection

31:27.240 --> 31:28.400
There is a bun shop in front

31:28.640 --> 31:29.599
I know the boss there

31:29.599 --> 31:30.640
He can vouch for me

31:31.240 --> 31:32.319
I put you down there

31:36.319 --> 31:37.279
what's on your mind

31:41.240 --> 31:42.279
have you ever thought about

31:43.319 --> 31:44.920
Zhao An already knows my identity

31:45.759 --> 31:46.880
There is no way he would let it go

31:46.880 --> 31:48.720
Those comrades who want to meet me

31:51.440 --> 31:52.799
When I stopped you at the teahouse

31:52.799 --> 31:54.359
You haven't met them yet

31:55.400 --> 31:56.720
So Zhao An temporarily

31:56.720 --> 31:58.279
Can't find which box it is from

32:02.480 --> 32:04.519
Based on your understanding of Zhao An, what would he do?

32:05.079 --> 32:06.720
Search all the private rooms on the second floor

32:08.000 --> 32:08.920
But just now

32:09.519 --> 32:11.559
We were making a lot of noise at the top of the stairs

32:12.160 --> 32:13.839
It is also a warning to comrades

32:13.839 --> 32:15.240
I believe they will take action

32:15.240 --> 32:17.119
And destroy important documents together

32:17.920 --> 32:19.519
Zhao An will never give up.

32:19.519 --> 32:20.799
He will bite him to death

32:21.000 --> 32:22.720
Even at the expense of hurting innocent people

32:23.000 --> 32:24.200
In that case

32:24.480 --> 32:26.160
The only person I can save is you

32:26.799 --> 32:27.759
more importantly

32:28.000 --> 32:30.319
Even if you use the reason just now to excuse yourself

32:31.160 --> 32:32.440
Luo Guanqun wouldn't believe it either

32:33.359 --> 32:34.920
Because once an agent is suspected,

32:35.599 --> 32:37.119
There is no value anymore

32:37.480 --> 32:38.640
Then what do you want me to do?

32:39.720 --> 32:41.200
Do you want me to die without saving you?

32:41.200 --> 32:42.640
I don't blame you

32:43.160 --> 32:44.160
I want to say

32:44.319 --> 32:46.160
I can't just walk away like this

32:47.640 --> 32:48.599
What can you do?

32:51.839 --> 32:53.599
I remember the first time we met

32:54.720 --> 32:56.279
You just rely on the difference in gunfire

32:56.279 --> 32:57.880
You can tell which agents are there

32:58.160 --> 33:00.000
What model of gun are you holding?

33:00.359 --> 33:01.559
How many bullets are left?

33:01.799 --> 33:03.240
Then annihilate them one by one

33:03.640 --> 33:05.759
At that time, I thought this comrade was so awesome.

33:05.839 --> 33:07.240
A hundred times more powerful than me

33:08.480 --> 33:10.000
If those comrades can be saved

33:10.400 --> 33:12.079
If you can successfully infiltrate

33:12.079 --> 33:13.000
mission accomplished

33:13.440 --> 33:14.799
I'm willing to sacrifice everything

33:14.799 --> 33:15.960
including my life

33:19.799 --> 33:21.039
you must cooperate with me

33:21.519 --> 33:22.920
This is an order

33:22.920 --> 33:24.519
I must let Zhao An's people catch me

33:35.200 --> 33:35.799
wake up

33:36.160 --> 33:37.599
What on earth do you do?

33:39.240 --> 33:40.200
It's the Communist Party

33:40.599 --> 33:41.319
Communist Party

33:41.680 --> 33:42.880
What are you doing?

33:42.880 --> 33:43.960
Communist Party

33:44.039 --> 33:45.039
Communist Party

33:45.200 --> 33:46.119
Communist Party

34:04.000 --> 34:05.200
Just as I expected

34:06.000 --> 34:06.880
It's smoke

34:07.039 --> 34:08.039
smoke soil

34:09.480 --> 34:11.320
You really are selling cigarettes?

34:12.159 --> 34:12.920
Go to Lao Lu's house

34:13.000 --> 34:14.880
Bring me the Lao Lu family

34:15.360 --> 34:15.880
yes

34:20.800 --> 34:21.480
Not Zhao An

34:21.480 --> 34:22.320
It's Luo Guanqun

34:23.119 --> 34:23.920
Luo Guanqun

34:27.199 --> 34:28.239
The story is like this

34:29.920 --> 34:30.840
I go to the teahouse

34:31.960 --> 34:32.760
In the process of going

34:32.800 --> 34:34.840
I happened to encounter Zhao An following you.

34:36.760 --> 34:38.239
And Zhao An just arrested Lao Tian before

34:38.239 --> 34:39.599
This CCP element

34:39.880 --> 34:41.239
So he's following you again

34:41.960 --> 34:44.039
I suspect that you and Lao Tian are both members of the Chinese Communist Party

34:44.480 --> 34:46.960
But I don’t want you to fall into Zhao An’s hands

34:47.440 --> 34:49.000
So you take me out of the teahouse

34:49.000 --> 34:50.239
Just to get rid of Zhao An

34:50.400 --> 34:51.760
And let Luo Guanqun catch me

34:51.760 --> 34:52.199
right

34:53.079 --> 34:54.079
This is why

34:54.679 --> 34:56.800
The reason why I desperately want to get rid of Chen Shugan

34:57.039 --> 34:58.360
Then why don't you just arrest me?

34:58.360 --> 34:59.320
Leave it to Luo Guanqun

34:59.559 --> 35:00.679
I'm afraid you have a gun

35:01.119 --> 35:02.440
I dare not act rashly

35:02.800 --> 35:04.840
After letting you go, I contacted Luo Guanqun

35:05.480 --> 35:06.639
Let him support me

35:07.360 --> 35:09.039
Wait until the large spoon appears

35:10.480 --> 35:11.679
Catch you again

35:12.239 --> 35:13.000
Then me

35:14.239 --> 35:15.400
where should it be

35:15.840 --> 35:16.920
Caught by you

35:16.960 --> 35:18.159
Grand Guangming Cinema

35:19.880 --> 35:21.880
I'll have a large spoon appear around there

35:22.199 --> 35:24.360
And you also happened to appear in front of the cinema

35:24.760 --> 35:26.519
The big horse spoon can catch you easily

35:27.320 --> 35:28.400
But you must remember

35:29.119 --> 35:30.679
Don’t let Chen Shugan discover you

35:31.199 --> 35:32.000
I know

35:33.000 --> 35:34.199
I'm like being caught by two eagles

35:34.199 --> 35:35.440
Staring chick

35:35.719 --> 35:37.199
It can only fall into your mouth

35:37.679 --> 35:38.199
right

35:39.000 --> 35:39.800
But the old road

35:40.920 --> 35:42.280
Getting caught is just the first step

35:43.000 --> 35:44.280
Next you will rebel

35:46.079 --> 35:46.840
mutiny

35:47.039 --> 35:48.159
You just rebelled

35:49.000 --> 35:50.360
Only then can we save those comrades

35:52.079 --> 35:54.719
But how could Luo Guanqun believe that I was rebellious?

35:54.760 --> 35:56.480
He won't believe you easily

35:57.320 --> 35:58.960
So let him think

35:59.639 --> 36:02.599
He found your most fatal weakness

36:03.000 --> 36:03.880
what weakness

36:04.000 --> 36:04.599
family

36:05.119 --> 36:05.719
you know my family

36:05.719 --> 36:06.360
I know

36:10.440 --> 36:12.320
At the same time that the big horse spoon takes you away

36:12.440 --> 36:14.480
I will forge some letters and documents

36:14.880 --> 36:15.679
do not worry

36:23.400 --> 36:24.360
Is anyone caught?

36:24.519 --> 36:26.239
There is no one at Lao Lu’s house.

36:26.239 --> 36:28.480
Is his wife and child supposed to be dead?

36:28.719 --> 36:29.239
What

36:29.719 --> 36:30.679
died

36:31.079 --> 36:31.559
yes

36:32.199 --> 36:32.599
he he he

36:32.599 --> 36:34.880
Although his house is kept clean

36:34.960 --> 36:36.679
But it feels like years

36:36.679 --> 36:37.679
No one lives there anymore

36:37.960 --> 36:39.119
I also found a photo

36:39.320 --> 36:41.440
It’s a photo of Lao Lu and his wife and children

36:41.679 --> 36:43.719
Then there was an incense burner next to the photo.

36:43.760 --> 36:44.679
There are also some offerings

36:44.760 --> 36:46.079
Buy these things on this old road

36:46.079 --> 36:47.880
It doesn’t seem like it was really given to his family.

36:48.280 --> 36:49.599
It was used as a memorial

37:02.599 --> 37:04.800
Once Luo Guanqun thinks you have rebelled,

37:05.800 --> 37:07.480
He will ask you to identify him

37:08.639 --> 37:09.679
several other comrades

37:10.280 --> 37:12.280
At this time you can only identify other people

37:12.519 --> 37:14.760
Only in this way can we ensure the safe evacuation of our comrades

37:15.079 --> 37:15.880
How is that possible?

37:15.880 --> 37:17.119
Wouldn’t it hurt innocent people?

37:17.199 --> 37:18.320
Won't hurt innocent people

37:19.679 --> 37:21.920
I have a friend who is a detective in the concession

37:21.920 --> 37:23.639
I've seen him there

37:23.960 --> 37:25.599
Files of some ex-convicts

37:26.239 --> 37:27.559
I couldn't find you when I arrived at the teahouse

37:27.559 --> 37:28.719
When I'm looking for you everywhere

37:29.039 --> 37:30.719
It happens to be in Dongli Hall on the second floor

37:31.599 --> 37:32.360
you remember

37:32.599 --> 37:34.400
It's the Dongli Hall on the second floor. There are two people there.

37:35.119 --> 37:36.880
These two people were previously members of the Avenue Government

37:37.199 --> 37:39.320
Tobacco resale in public sales offices in Shanghai

37:39.840 --> 37:41.559
But later the tobacco was taken over by the Japanese

37:41.559 --> 37:42.559
After monopolizing

37:43.039 --> 37:45.519
They started the human trafficking business again

37:46.239 --> 37:47.840
And he has several lives on his hands

37:48.480 --> 37:49.320
A heinous crime

37:49.320 --> 37:50.000
But those two drug dealers

37:50.000 --> 37:51.679
It’s impossible to admit that you are the CCP

37:51.840 --> 37:52.679
Do not worry

37:53.159 --> 37:55.679
Luo Guanqun has many ways to make them admit it

37:55.679 --> 37:57.920
Luo Guanqun will discover the flaw sooner or later

37:57.920 --> 37:58.440
right

37:59.960 --> 38:00.960
this is the key

38:02.079 --> 38:04.719
When Luo Guanqun found out you were cheating on him

38:04.920 --> 38:07.079
He will hate you to the core

38:07.920 --> 38:10.639
He will use the most cruel means to destroy you

38:11.360 --> 38:12.199
torture you

38:13.159 --> 38:14.440
Make your life worse than death

38:18.239 --> 38:18.960
Scared me

38:20.559 --> 38:21.239
OK

38:22.320 --> 38:23.239
Just do it

38:23.760 --> 38:24.920
communist

38:26.159 --> 38:27.440
I'm not afraid of intimidation

39:10.880 --> 39:11.920
Yumo calligraphy and painting shop

39:11.920 --> 39:13.079
Found under the floor

39:14.880 --> 39:15.960
Is it valuable?

39:16.760 --> 39:17.960
I do not know

39:17.960 --> 39:19.199
You have to see it

39:21.800 --> 39:24.679
We have all been deceived by this old way.

39:29.039 --> 39:31.000
Can those tea drinkers be captured again?

39:31.280 --> 39:32.440
How about a new trial?

39:33.599 --> 39:34.920
The address is saved

39:35.119 --> 39:36.639
What do you think about the CCP?

39:36.639 --> 39:38.480
Will you give us real information?

39:41.039 --> 39:42.039
Blame me

39:43.599 --> 39:45.960
These forged letters

39:45.960 --> 39:47.199
The documents were cheated

39:47.840 --> 39:50.039
I really thought he had family in Shanghai

39:50.559 --> 39:51.639
We were careless

39:52.320 --> 39:54.360
I should have sent someone to his house long ago

40:02.880 --> 40:03.679
large spoon

40:16.679 --> 40:17.559
Boss Lu

40:19.159 --> 40:21.440
Who are you lying to? You shouldn't lie to us?

40:22.519 --> 40:25.440
How much business have Manager Luo and I taken care of for you?

40:30.280 --> 40:31.159
Section Chief Chen

40:33.360 --> 40:34.960
rabbit shoulder purple hair

40:37.840 --> 40:38.639
easy to use

40:41.960 --> 40:42.519
Boss Lu

40:42.519 --> 40:43.679
Manager Luo

40:45.840 --> 40:47.960
Flower and bird pattern pen box

40:49.599 --> 40:50.880
easy to use

40:53.840 --> 40:54.719
Boss Lu

40:56.800 --> 40:57.960
Why are you doing this?

40:59.400 --> 41:00.880
Open your calligraphy and painting shop

41:02.719 --> 41:04.760
Isn’t it good to live your little life?

41:05.320 --> 41:05.840
good

41:07.960 --> 41:08.840
Of course

41:11.880 --> 41:13.800
drive away the Japanese invaders

41:15.519 --> 41:18.800
Root out all you traitor lackeys

41:19.559 --> 41:21.519
Such a good day

41:24.159 --> 41:28.000
One hundred years is not enough for me

41:34.800 --> 41:36.000
I can't find anything else

41:36.000 --> 41:36.880
I go first

41:36.960 --> 41:37.440
etc.

41:40.199 --> 41:41.079
what does it mean

41:42.400 --> 41:43.280
kill him

41:45.599 --> 41:46.440
Not Lao Luo

41:47.280 --> 41:48.760
I'm not good at this

42:06.159 --> 42:07.079
No more trials

42:07.480 --> 42:08.360
I believe you

42:09.519 --> 42:10.760
He won't say anything

42:13.960 --> 42:15.400
My marksmanship is not good

42:16.119 --> 42:16.760
If you miss

42:16.760 --> 42:17.880
Don't laugh at me

42:40.519 --> 42:41.360
what do you mean

42:41.559 --> 42:43.400
I loaded the blanks

42:45.920 --> 42:47.360
He suspects that I am in the same group with him

42:47.559 --> 42:48.840
I didn't say that

42:55.719 --> 42:56.119
right

42:58.440 --> 43:00.079
I'm in the same group as him

43:01.519 --> 43:03.239
I go to Yumo calligraphy and painting shop

43:03.880 --> 43:05.519
Just to pass on information to him

43:05.840 --> 43:06.920
interconnected

43:07.920 --> 43:08.760
And today

43:09.719 --> 43:11.920
It's also the two of us who are in cahoots

43:11.920 --> 43:13.440
Identify those two drug dealers

43:14.320 --> 43:15.199
For what?

43:15.840 --> 43:17.360
Just for the CCP in the teahouse

43:17.360 --> 43:18.719
buy time to escape

43:19.400 --> 43:20.119
besides

43:20.960 --> 43:23.280
You said that the four of clubs is me

43:23.800 --> 43:25.199
I am the Four of Clubs
