01:34.799 --> 01:35.640
Hello

01:35.640 --> 01:36.519
I am Yamashita

01:36.760 --> 01:38.959
Lloyd Road in five minutes

01:39.359 --> 01:42.120
The phone booth opposite Tai Sheng Leather Store

01:42.879 --> 01:43.959
if late

01:44.519 --> 01:45.640
cancel transaction

01:57.719 --> 01:58.599
keep up

03:00.240 --> 03:01.080
I have arrived

03:01.080 --> 03:02.039
Can it be traded?

03:02.520 --> 03:04.719
Luban Road seven minutes later

03:04.719 --> 03:05.759
if late

03:05.759 --> 03:06.840
cancel transaction

03:07.080 --> 03:08.039
What tricks are you doing?

03:08.039 --> 03:08.400
you

03:19.759 --> 03:20.680
Lu Ban Road

03:21.240 --> 03:22.000
okay

03:23.000 --> 03:24.039
Sit tight

03:27.800 --> 03:28.400
quick

03:44.719 --> 03:45.759
Over here, you two

03:46.360 --> 03:47.199
Over there

03:47.199 --> 03:47.719
Walk

04:02.919 --> 04:05.280
Yamashita Takeo must want to know

04:05.280 --> 04:06.840
Who are they trading with?

04:07.199 --> 04:09.439
Whether it's his men or himself

04:10.000 --> 04:11.319
There will definitely be an ambush set up.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.319
As long as we get the box

04:13.319 --> 04:15.199
He will definitely find a way to follow

04:15.479 --> 04:17.439
I keep changing the place where I trade

04:18.040 --> 04:20.600
Just want to get rid of the people they are following and ambushing.

04:21.759 --> 04:23.240
Then you can't get rid of it

04:24.480 --> 04:26.920
That's when it's time for you to play

04:33.079 --> 04:34.839
Brother, your plan is good.

04:35.560 --> 04:37.120
but your last call

04:37.480 --> 04:39.160
Call the phone booth on Luban Road

04:39.879 --> 04:41.279
Around 3:10 p.m.

04:42.560 --> 04:43.240
Why

04:47.160 --> 04:47.920
parking

04:47.920 --> 04:48.480
good

05:09.279 --> 05:10.639
How many places do you want me to run?

05:11.040 --> 05:12.480
You'll be out of the phone booth later

05:12.480 --> 05:14.040
A rickshaw will pass by

05:14.879 --> 05:17.360
You threw your stuff in the back of the rickshaw

05:18.680 --> 05:20.040
You fooled me for a long time

05:20.040 --> 05:21.319
When will you give me the recipe?

05:21.720 --> 05:23.639
Wait until I confirm the number of gold bars

05:24.040 --> 05:25.160
nature will give it to you

05:25.759 --> 05:26.360
besides

05:26.600 --> 05:27.560
six o'clock

05:27.839 --> 05:29.920
Keep waiting for my news in this phone booth

05:30.560 --> 05:31.720
Why should I believe you?

05:32.079 --> 05:33.120
Gold bars are given to you

05:33.120 --> 05:34.600
What should I do if the recipe is not given to me?

05:35.160 --> 05:36.680
You can choose not to believe me

05:37.360 --> 05:38.519
but i think

05:39.160 --> 05:40.800
you have no other choice

05:42.040 --> 05:42.600
good

05:42.920 --> 05:44.000
I trust you

05:44.000 --> 05:45.639
But I don't have time to wait for you anymore

05:46.720 --> 05:48.519
You'll call later

05:48.519 --> 05:50.199
To Kikukawa Japanese Store

05:50.639 --> 05:51.319
good

05:51.600 --> 05:52.680
knew

06:37.920 --> 06:40.560
we were fooled

06:43.879 --> 06:46.519
Turn around from Luban Road and you'll find Nongshanxi Road.

06:46.759 --> 06:48.319
At ten minutes past three in the afternoon

06:48.680 --> 06:50.600
That was when Tongxing Automobile Dealers changed shifts.

06:50.600 --> 06:51.720
There are many cars there

06:57.680 --> 06:59.199
It's useless to clean it up

07:00.680 --> 07:01.600
OK OK OK

07:31.319 --> 07:32.639
Chinese gold

07:33.000 --> 07:35.160
It should be returned to the hands of the Chinese

07:35.399 --> 07:37.000
Do you think so?

07:39.120 --> 07:39.519
okay

07:39.519 --> 07:40.279
Stop biting

07:40.279 --> 07:41.040
Count quickly

07:41.040 --> 07:42.160
Check if the number is correct

07:42.160 --> 07:43.360
Don't blame me then

07:43.959 --> 07:45.360
I forgive him for not daring to lose one.

07:45.720 --> 07:46.720
counting

07:49.680 --> 07:51.920
You said you made the mountain go round and round

07:52.399 --> 07:54.079
Can you give him what he wants?

07:56.920 --> 07:58.079
Do you want to give it or not?

08:01.959 --> 08:04.000
Even though I wouldn’t expect to be beaten to death at the foot of this mountain,

08:04.000 --> 08:05.160
It was you who made the deal with him

08:06.480 --> 08:08.680
But if he can't get the formula

08:08.680 --> 08:10.279
Mobilize troops to investigate

08:10.720 --> 08:13.000
No matter what happens, this will be traced to us, right?

08:14.639 --> 08:15.519
But forget it

08:16.959 --> 08:18.079
It’s better not to give it

08:18.079 --> 08:18.759
otherwise

08:18.759 --> 08:19.639
Go! Go! Go

08:20.160 --> 08:22.160
Otherwise, you have to ask me to deliver it again.

08:23.240 --> 08:25.399
four or five

08:25.680 --> 08:26.680
Doing business

08:27.959 --> 08:29.240
Money and goods settled

08:29.360 --> 08:29.920
eight

08:30.879 --> 08:33.000
I actually have no use for this edge paper recipe.

08:33.559 --> 08:34.279
so

08:37.919 --> 08:40.000
Leave it to Colonel Yamashita for me

08:44.399 --> 08:45.679
You still have to give it away, right?

08:46.679 --> 08:47.600
Where to send

08:51.080 --> 08:52.120
Xiafei Road

08:52.720 --> 08:54.080
There is a phone booth on Xiafei Road

08:54.320 --> 08:55.159
six o'clock

08:55.639 --> 08:58.120
I'll call the Kikukawa Japanese Store

08:58.279 --> 09:00.679
You put this thing away before six o'clock

09:00.960 --> 09:03.360
Put it behind the phone in the phone booth

09:03.600 --> 09:04.519
Remember

09:05.039 --> 09:07.200
You have to leave quickly before six o'clock

09:07.879 --> 09:09.840
Kikukawa Japanese Store

09:10.120 --> 09:10.720
right

09:11.039 --> 09:11.879
that time

09:11.879 --> 09:13.919
He should be with his fiancée

09:18.279 --> 09:18.960
OK OK OK

09:18.960 --> 09:19.840
I see

09:25.039 --> 09:25.960
Don't move

09:28.159 --> 09:29.360
Don't you believe me?

09:30.679 --> 09:31.639
I believe

09:32.120 --> 09:32.840
How much do you believe in me?

09:32.840 --> 09:33.679
How much do I trust you

09:41.919 --> 09:42.679
How about it

09:43.039 --> 09:44.399
Proceed as originally planned

10:13.679 --> 10:15.279
The handwriting is obviously different

10:15.279 --> 10:17.360
The raw materials and proportions written are also different.

10:17.919 --> 10:19.080
This recipe is fake

10:19.600 --> 10:20.799
Luo Guanqun is testing me

10:36.519 --> 10:37.440
Hello

10:37.639 --> 10:38.879
Mr. Yamashita

10:38.879 --> 10:40.159
welcome

10:40.759 --> 10:41.559
Where is the cold dew?

10:42.000 --> 10:43.440
Hanlu is accompanied by her friends

10:43.440 --> 10:44.799
Are you trying on a kimono over there?

10:51.960 --> 10:53.399
The small cloth bag given to me by Luo Guanqun

10:53.399 --> 10:55.000
Put it behind the phone booth on Xiafei Road

10:55.720 --> 10:57.519
It will eventually come back to him

10:58.000 --> 10:59.519
At that time, if the formula inside

10:59.519 --> 11:01.440
Not the one he put in

11:01.440 --> 11:03.559
This proves that I was the one who changed the formula.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.519
Luo Guanqun must have the real formula

11:05.519 --> 11:07.399
Put it somewhere else

11:07.879 --> 11:10.039
He will call Yamashita at six o'clock

11:10.440 --> 11:11.840
tell him where the recipe is

11:12.600 --> 11:14.879
That's my last chance too

11:39.639 --> 11:40.639
Mr. Yamashita

11:40.639 --> 11:41.440
Come and see

11:43.720 --> 11:45.799
Miss Hanlu’s temperament is graceful and luxurious

11:45.799 --> 11:46.440
so

11:46.440 --> 11:48.919
I specially chose the royal style with brocade

11:48.919 --> 11:49.840
How about it

11:52.080 --> 11:52.720
beautiful

11:55.159 --> 11:55.919
So beautiful

11:57.519 --> 11:59.039
I'm so embarrassed by your praise

11:59.440 --> 12:02.080
I also think this outfit is too gorgeous.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.639
Hello, what can I do for you?

12:15.679 --> 12:16.960
wedding time

12:16.960 --> 12:18.240
I will also wear a horn

12:20.639 --> 12:21.360
yes

12:21.759 --> 12:22.559
Miss Zuo

12:22.559 --> 12:23.919
It's your phone number

12:26.840 --> 12:28.919
It’s Higashida-kun, the owner of the Japanese confectionery shop.

12:29.279 --> 12:30.000
I'll just pick it up

12:30.000 --> 12:30.600
good

12:45.919 --> 12:46.600
Hello

12:47.159 --> 12:48.039
Hey it's me

12:49.600 --> 12:50.799
It's Higashikata-kun

12:51.240 --> 12:52.159
Hello

12:52.159 --> 12:52.840
at six o'clock

12:52.840 --> 12:54.159
Yamashita will receive a call

12:54.159 --> 12:55.759
The phone will tell Yamashita an address.

12:56.080 --> 12:57.480
You and Hanlu must find a way

12:57.480 --> 12:58.399
Get this address

12:59.039 --> 13:00.440
i want to be at the wedding

13:00.440 --> 13:02.600
Prepare Japanese snacks for guests

13:02.919 --> 13:04.759
Zuo Shuangtao helped me contact this company

13:04.759 --> 13:07.360
They were anxious to decide on the types and styles of dim sum.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.360
I asked them to call here.

13:14.120 --> 13:15.519
I've made you worry about it

13:16.559 --> 13:17.320
should

13:18.559 --> 13:20.080
You mean water yokan?

13:20.080 --> 13:21.200
Is Mohagi the best?

13:21.200 --> 13:21.840
yes

13:21.840 --> 13:22.720
all I want

13:23.360 --> 13:24.240
be safe

13:24.840 --> 13:25.480
OK

13:25.759 --> 13:26.440
goodbye

13:41.679 --> 13:42.000
Hello

13:42.759 --> 13:43.320
two knives

13:44.200 --> 13:46.039
Find a few people to pretend to be debt collectors

13:46.039 --> 13:48.159
Go to Gujialong No. 32 at six o'clock

13:48.240 --> 13:49.440
Debt collector

13:49.440 --> 13:50.240
No need to pretend

13:50.240 --> 13:51.240
I know a lot of them

13:53.840 --> 13:54.840
This Higashikata-kun

13:54.840 --> 13:56.240
It’s so verbose

13:56.240 --> 13:57.679
But I've explained everything

13:59.240 --> 14:00.679
Thanks to you

14:00.679 --> 14:02.039
Otherwise there are so many things

14:02.039 --> 14:04.039
I really can't take care of it by myself

14:09.799 --> 14:10.639
Miss Hanlu

14:11.039 --> 14:12.720
I picked out a Hakata belt for you

14:12.720 --> 14:14.120
I think it would look better with it

14:14.120 --> 14:15.279
How about we try again

14:16.240 --> 14:17.120
What do you think

14:25.159 --> 14:25.960
Then I'll try

14:26.720 --> 14:27.519
give it to me

14:31.600 --> 14:32.679
I'll just come

14:43.200 --> 14:45.679
I'll get a call at six o'clock

14:45.679 --> 14:47.639
The phone will tell Yamashita an address.

14:47.639 --> 14:49.320
We have to get the address first

14:49.919 --> 14:50.720
then what should i do

14:51.240 --> 14:52.039
take it easy

14:52.240 --> 14:53.320
Do everything as I say

15:08.720 --> 15:09.320
cold dew

15:09.679 --> 15:11.120
It's getting late today

15:11.120 --> 15:13.519
This halo brocade kimono you tried on

15:13.519 --> 15:14.159
It's settled

15:14.879 --> 15:15.559
correct

15:15.559 --> 15:17.600
I'm here to choose a kimono for me today.

15:17.600 --> 15:18.759
I haven’t picked out a set for you yet.

15:19.519 --> 15:20.399
I'm in no hurry

15:20.399 --> 15:21.879
Today I mainly want to help you try it out

15:22.240 --> 15:23.679
Another six o'clock

15:23.960 --> 15:26.080
I have one more thing to do

15:26.519 --> 15:27.200
six o'clock

15:29.000 --> 15:30.240
It's only half past five

15:30.240 --> 15:31.240
There's enough time

15:31.240 --> 15:32.399
when you are not around

15:32.399 --> 15:34.000
Shuangtao and I helped you choose a set

15:34.399 --> 15:35.039
You go and try it

15:35.840 --> 15:38.080
It was carefully selected by Miss Hanlu

15:38.080 --> 15:39.960
Weft brocade pattern with feather woven hakama

15:41.679 --> 15:42.679
I'll get it

15:56.360 --> 15:57.720
Just try it

15:59.360 --> 16:00.120
people

16:00.559 --> 16:02.600
I also want to see you as a groom.

16:05.240 --> 16:06.279
OK

16:06.799 --> 16:07.360
good

16:23.440 --> 16:24.200
Brought it

16:26.600 --> 16:27.519
go try

16:28.360 --> 16:29.279
go try

16:56.440 --> 16:57.000
Manager Luo

16:58.320 --> 16:59.279
How about it

16:59.279 --> 16:59.799
got it

17:00.840 --> 17:01.919
come and see

17:11.680 --> 17:12.480
How about it

17:13.799 --> 17:15.000
He didn't change it either

17:15.920 --> 17:16.839
Didn't you change it?

17:19.200 --> 17:19.480
Where is it?

17:19.480 --> 17:20.599
Just these brothers

17:20.599 --> 17:21.519
This debt-ridden gambler

17:21.519 --> 17:22.519
Just upstairs here

17:22.519 --> 17:23.319
gambler

17:23.319 --> 17:24.119
come down

17:25.000 --> 17:26.680
come down

17:26.680 --> 17:27.920
Debtful gambler, come down

17:29.359 --> 17:30.839
Who is it?

17:30.839 --> 17:32.799
Come down quickly

17:46.759 --> 17:47.480
cold dew

17:48.880 --> 17:49.440
How about it

17:50.519 --> 17:52.519
Why is it so different from what I thought?

17:53.400 --> 17:54.720
Zuo Shuangtao, what do you think?

17:56.079 --> 17:56.799
may be

17:57.119 --> 17:59.440
Is it a problem with the fabric?

17:59.440 --> 18:00.400
Too soft

18:00.799 --> 18:02.640
I didn’t mention Mr. Yamashita’s physical characteristics

18:02.640 --> 18:03.519
show it

18:05.319 --> 18:07.079
I think it's okay

18:08.799 --> 18:09.519
correct

18:09.519 --> 18:11.200
Do you remember the other set we chose?

18:12.480 --> 18:12.920
right

18:12.920 --> 18:14.559
It's brocade woven fabric

18:15.079 --> 18:16.160
That one is stiffer

18:16.160 --> 18:17.960
Might be more suitable for Mr. Yamashita

18:18.200 --> 18:18.880
I'll take it

18:18.880 --> 18:19.319
good

18:19.319 --> 18:20.200
Hurry up

18:27.440 --> 18:29.279
Wedding is a major event in a woman's life

18:29.640 --> 18:30.480
every detail

18:30.480 --> 18:32.440
It has to be perfect

18:34.079 --> 18:35.839
Don't be impatient

18:45.559 --> 18:46.960
How could I be impatient?

18:47.519 --> 18:48.119
good

18:48.599 --> 18:50.799
I will try until you are satisfied

18:52.160 --> 18:52.680
good

18:52.799 --> 18:54.240
Gamblers, come out now

18:54.240 --> 18:54.759
come down

18:55.279 --> 18:56.279
leave them alone

18:56.799 --> 18:57.799
Come down and pay back the money

18:59.599 --> 19:00.799
come down

19:00.799 --> 19:02.039
Come down and pay back the money

19:14.079 --> 19:14.839
The clothes are here

19:14.839 --> 19:15.839
Go and try it

19:15.839 --> 19:16.799
You have something else to do later

19:17.799 --> 19:18.440
Go quickly

19:19.079 --> 19:20.039
Go quickly

19:28.839 --> 19:30.160
It should be Higashida-kun

19:30.160 --> 19:32.160
He just asked me about your taste preferences

19:32.160 --> 19:33.599
I really don't know

19:33.599 --> 19:35.200
I'm sorry to bother you

19:35.200 --> 19:36.240
Miss Hanlu

19:36.240 --> 19:37.160
Go pick it up

19:37.160 --> 19:37.839
good

19:38.880 --> 19:39.880
I'll answer the phone

19:39.880 --> 19:40.759
Go try it quickly

19:41.079 --> 19:41.839
Go try it quickly

19:42.759 --> 19:43.599
Go try it quickly

19:55.680 --> 19:56.119
Hello

19:56.119 --> 19:57.279
Is it Higashida-kun?

19:57.279 --> 19:59.839
Is this the Kikukawa Japanese Store?

20:00.240 --> 20:00.960
yes

20:00.960 --> 20:01.960
I'm looking for Mr. Yamashita

20:05.000 --> 20:05.920
open the door open the door

20:06.319 --> 20:06.960
open the door

20:07.519 --> 20:09.440
Mr. Yamashita is trying on clothes

20:09.440 --> 20:10.440
Who are you

20:11.000 --> 20:12.400
I made an appointment with Yamashita

20:13.519 --> 20:14.480
what are you doing

20:14.480 --> 20:15.519
Drive them away

20:15.720 --> 20:16.759
You are sick

20:16.759 --> 20:18.200
Are you going to attract the police?

20:20.440 --> 20:21.799
He was trying on a kimono

20:21.799 --> 20:23.039
There are also various accessories

20:23.039 --> 20:24.319
It might take a while

20:24.599 --> 20:26.640
How about you call back later?

20:27.680 --> 20:29.160
can you make him hurry up

20:32.960 --> 20:34.559
come down

20:34.799 --> 20:35.359
Pay back the money

20:35.559 --> 20:36.319
come down

20:36.440 --> 20:37.240
Did you hear that?

20:37.240 --> 20:37.880
hurry up

20:38.480 --> 20:39.519
Are you okay at the foot of the mountain?

20:40.240 --> 20:41.279
The police are coming

20:41.279 --> 20:42.480
The police are coming, go quickly

20:42.480 --> 20:43.319
stop

20:43.319 --> 20:43.640
Go quickly

20:43.640 --> 20:44.079
Don't run

20:44.079 --> 20:45.119
stop

20:46.200 --> 20:47.960
You tell him I can't wait any longer

20:47.960 --> 20:50.240
The location is Sanguantang Road

20:50.240 --> 20:52.519
The sixth telephone pole from west to east

20:52.519 --> 20:53.599
The phone booth opposite

20:53.599 --> 20:55.240
There's something behind the phone

20:55.240 --> 20:56.240
have you understood

20:56.920 --> 20:57.279
good

20:57.279 --> 20:58.200
I wrote it down

20:59.759 --> 21:01.000
I'll tell him

21:02.240 --> 21:03.039
Go quickly

21:10.720 --> 21:11.720
Hello Higashida-kun

21:12.119 --> 21:12.920
Miss Hanlu

21:13.839 --> 21:14.640
How about it

21:14.640 --> 21:16.119
Did Yamashita doubt you?

21:26.279 --> 21:28.039
Ge Ying doesn’t have it

21:28.039 --> 21:28.799
Then replace it with a big fortune roll

21:30.000 --> 21:31.920
Don't eat these common people's snacks

21:31.920 --> 21:33.680
Mr. Yamashita will be unhappy

21:35.640 --> 21:36.720
Mr. Yamashita

21:37.680 --> 21:38.680
according to tradition

21:38.920 --> 21:40.960
The wedding kimono must be matched with a haori

21:42.599 --> 21:44.000
Yamashita-kun

21:44.559 --> 21:45.799
This is the last one

21:45.799 --> 21:47.079
Go try it quickly

21:50.960 --> 21:51.920
quickly

22:01.839 --> 22:03.440
Sanguantang Road from west to east

22:03.440 --> 22:05.640
The phone booth next to the sixth telephone pole

22:05.640 --> 22:06.880
There's something behind the phone

22:07.319 --> 22:07.880
good

22:08.359 --> 22:10.039
But I have to get there before going down the mountain

22:10.519 --> 22:11.599
But where I am now

22:11.599 --> 22:12.880
Compared to Japanese stores

22:13.160 --> 22:14.200
Further away from Sanguantang Road

22:15.200 --> 22:16.960
You must find a way to help me drag me down the mountain

22:17.519 --> 22:18.039
good

22:28.319 --> 22:29.160
Miss Hanlu

22:29.160 --> 22:29.839
Are you okay?

22:30.160 --> 22:31.440
Chen Jiaping asked us to drag Shanxia down

22:32.200 --> 22:33.279
Miss Hanlu

22:35.160 --> 22:37.920
When walking in kimono, you have to take small steps.

22:37.920 --> 22:38.759
yes

22:38.759 --> 22:40.319
Look, I almost fell down

22:43.799 --> 22:46.599
This brocade-embellished kimono is paired with a haori

22:46.599 --> 22:48.000
It's really extraordinary

22:48.680 --> 22:50.079
Zuo Shuangtao, what do you think?

22:50.680 --> 22:51.720
I think so

22:52.200 --> 22:54.839
This outfit really looks like Mr. Yamashita

22:54.839 --> 22:56.319
More tall and stalwart

23:06.960 --> 23:07.559
correct

23:07.960 --> 23:10.640
Why did the phone ring twice just now?

23:11.960 --> 23:13.440
After answering Dongtian's call,

23:13.440 --> 23:14.680
I picked up another one

23:14.680 --> 23:15.160
Who are you looking for?

23:15.799 --> 23:16.480
looking for you

23:18.039 --> 23:18.960
Looking for me

23:19.359 --> 23:19.960
Who is it?

23:20.279 --> 23:21.440
He didn't say

23:21.440 --> 23:22.920
That person is weird

23:22.920 --> 23:24.519
But he left an address for you

23:24.759 --> 23:25.559
address

23:27.799 --> 23:28.880
why don't you tell me

23:29.799 --> 23:31.160
You were trying on a kimono just now

23:36.319 --> 23:37.640
It's not yet six o'clock

23:45.519 --> 23:46.759
you hurt me

23:48.359 --> 23:50.079
Why is my watch slow?

23:51.279 --> 23:53.480
Could it be when you were just trying on clothes?

23:53.480 --> 23:55.079
I accidentally touched the watch crown

23:55.079 --> 23:55.720
cold dew

23:56.640 --> 23:57.440
address

23:57.599 --> 23:58.160
address

24:00.519 --> 24:01.960
I wrote down the address on the note.

24:01.960 --> 24:02.759
Where is the note?

24:02.759 --> 24:03.839
Don't yell at me

24:04.200 --> 24:04.680
you yell at me

24:04.680 --> 24:05.160
so I

24:05.440 --> 24:06.559
I can't even remember it

24:06.559 --> 24:07.279
think carefully

24:07.279 --> 24:08.559
think carefully

24:08.559 --> 24:09.200
I

24:09.720 --> 24:10.960
I put it in my bag

24:11.839 --> 24:12.039
I

24:12.119 --> 24:12.880
I'll find it

24:13.279 --> 24:14.079
I'll find it

24:21.200 --> 24:21.960
here

24:31.839 --> 24:33.400
where exactly

24:34.000 --> 24:34.400
I

24:35.440 --> 24:36.880
How could it not be?

24:36.880 --> 24:37.519
Here it is

24:37.519 --> 24:38.359
The address is here

24:38.359 --> 24:39.200
I clearly remember

24:57.440 --> 24:58.160
etc.

25:00.279 --> 25:01.039
etc.

25:01.039 --> 25:02.920
I just discussed it with Zuo Shuangtao

25:02.920 --> 25:04.039
Since it’s a Japanese wedding

25:04.039 --> 25:06.039
You should wear the most traditional pure white kimono

25:06.039 --> 25:06.440
Look at this set

25:06.440 --> 25:07.200
cold dew

25:07.720 --> 25:09.519
I'm looking forward to you wearing Bai Wuguan's look

25:09.519 --> 25:10.680
But I have something very important now

25:10.680 --> 25:11.599
Have to leave right away

25:11.599 --> 25:12.759
You are not allowed to leave

25:13.359 --> 25:15.240
If you don’t accompany me to try on this kimono,

25:15.440 --> 25:16.960
I won’t get married like this

25:19.559 --> 25:20.559
Miss Hanlu

25:24.519 --> 25:26.079
How long does it take to get to Sanguantang Road?

25:26.319 --> 25:27.079
five minutes

25:27.240 --> 25:27.839
quick

25:49.680 --> 25:50.640
Are you OK

26:04.039 --> 26:04.839
how long will it take

26:05.119 --> 26:06.359
Just turn at the intersection ahead.

26:07.240 --> 26:07.799
Hurry up

27:07.440 --> 27:08.519
Could it be

27:10.119 --> 27:12.640
I'm still destined to be a concierge after all.

27:38.720 --> 27:39.839
Reflective

27:43.759 --> 27:44.559
Glass

28:09.720 --> 28:11.559
glass reflective

28:14.920 --> 28:15.759
sorry

28:16.880 --> 28:18.240
I didn't do well enough today

28:21.279 --> 28:22.640
you did good enough

28:24.119 --> 28:25.680
I'm worried about you now

28:26.960 --> 28:28.559
There is an old fox at the foot of the mountain

28:34.440 --> 28:36.079
I know how to deal with him

28:36.720 --> 28:37.759
Today I

28:39.519 --> 28:41.200
While helping you change clothes

28:41.519 --> 28:43.599
I saw a lot of injuries on your body

28:44.640 --> 28:46.279
Does he often abuse you?

28:56.160 --> 28:58.079
Yamashita is really a devil

28:59.039 --> 29:01.039
It's too painful for you to continue like this

29:01.039 --> 29:02.240
You should leave him as soon as possible

29:02.240 --> 29:03.599
Leave Shanghai

29:06.400 --> 29:08.119
After I'm done I think

29:08.119 --> 29:10.079
I should finish things before

29:11.400 --> 29:12.440
I will not leave

29:14.119 --> 29:16.720
But you are walking on thin ice by doing this

29:19.000 --> 29:21.119
Just think of it as making a thriller movie

29:22.039 --> 29:23.559
I have played love roles

29:23.960 --> 29:24.880
comedy

29:26.039 --> 29:27.160
There are also costumes

29:28.920 --> 29:30.759
I haven’t made a thriller movie yet.

29:32.319 --> 29:33.759
like robin hood

29:36.400 --> 29:37.720
It’s fun to think about it

29:43.799 --> 29:44.759
You have to promise me

29:45.440 --> 29:46.240
You and Chen Jiaping

29:46.839 --> 29:48.480
We must be together happily

29:49.079 --> 29:50.160
Never leave each other

29:56.319 --> 29:58.440
I can no longer be happy

30:00.680 --> 30:03.160
So as long as I see you can be happy

30:07.079 --> 30:09.000
It's a kind of satisfaction

30:20.880 --> 30:21.920
What did you say

30:22.880 --> 30:26.079
The recipe is not in the phone booth on Sanguantang Road

30:26.079 --> 30:26.640
right

30:27.160 --> 30:28.240
Behind this phone

30:28.640 --> 30:29.839
Just such a button

30:30.400 --> 30:31.279
Then inside this button

30:31.279 --> 30:32.759
Is there any mystery?

30:33.079 --> 30:34.000
I've checked everything

30:34.000 --> 30:34.880
Nothing at all

30:34.880 --> 30:36.240
Just an ordinary button

30:38.279 --> 30:39.359
This is not a button

30:40.079 --> 30:41.119
It's cufflinks

30:41.720 --> 30:42.559
cufflinks

30:43.400 --> 30:45.680
Will the formula be taken away by Yamashita in advance?

30:46.440 --> 30:47.319
Nope

30:47.839 --> 30:49.960
I saw with my own eyes that Yamashita arrived later than me.

30:51.200 --> 30:53.279
That means Luo Guanqun deceived Shanxia

30:58.480 --> 30:59.720
I think it's impossible

31:00.799 --> 31:03.000
If Luo Guanqun wants to deceive Shanxia

31:03.359 --> 31:05.680
Then he can run away completely after getting the gold bars.

31:05.680 --> 31:07.680
Why do you have to wait until six o'clock to call?

31:07.680 --> 31:08.720
There's no need

31:09.359 --> 31:11.039
So what's going on?

31:14.640 --> 31:15.519
I don't know either

31:16.000 --> 31:17.240
This is so weird

31:19.319 --> 31:20.400
Think about it again

31:22.319 --> 31:23.519
But anyway

31:24.640 --> 31:26.039
You did a great job today

31:26.440 --> 31:27.359
And cold dew

31:30.519 --> 31:31.640
Just didn't expect it

31:32.160 --> 31:34.160
Our first real collaboration

31:34.759 --> 31:35.880
It failed

31:37.759 --> 31:39.319
This matter is not over yet

31:39.640 --> 31:41.240
Yamashita didn't get the formula

31:41.240 --> 31:42.920
He won't give up either

31:43.240 --> 31:44.160
The same to you

31:44.839 --> 31:46.160
Not careful at all

31:46.839 --> 31:47.680
The injury from last time hasn’t healed yet

31:47.680 --> 31:48.839
Injured again this time

31:49.960 --> 31:51.200
I'm out of iodine. I'll buy some iodine.

31:51.519 --> 31:52.440
forget it

31:52.440 --> 31:53.759
This pharmacy is closed

31:53.759 --> 31:54.720
let's talk tomorrow

31:57.720 --> 31:58.640
my office

31:58.839 --> 31:59.680
tincture of iodine

32:00.960 --> 32:01.960
I'll go with you

32:03.279 --> 32:04.680
Just don't go

32:04.680 --> 32:05.799
stay well

32:05.799 --> 32:06.880
I'll be back soon

32:08.000 --> 32:09.119
Pay attention to safety

32:15.440 --> 32:16.079
forty five

32:18.400 --> 32:19.039
forty six

32:22.559 --> 32:23.200
Kobayashi

32:23.200 --> 32:23.920
get off work

32:23.920 --> 32:24.839
Is there anyone else upstairs?

32:24.839 --> 32:25.799
There's no one left, everyone's gone

32:26.000 --> 32:26.640
good

32:32.119 --> 32:33.759
Is there anyone else upstairs?

33:43.680 --> 33:44.799
The lady has arrived

33:44.799 --> 33:45.119
Give

33:45.920 --> 33:46.559
Thanks

34:00.759 --> 34:01.799
Chief Uchida

34:02.160 --> 34:04.079
Whenever you subscribe to Liangyou Magazine

34:04.079 --> 34:04.599
and

34:05.079 --> 34:06.640
Office with glass countertop

34:06.640 --> 34:07.720
There are eight rooms in total

34:07.960 --> 34:08.760
but

34:09.599 --> 34:10.920
With this kind of structure

34:11.639 --> 34:13.000
There is only Manager Luo’s room

34:13.320 --> 34:14.960
I can confirm now

34:14.960 --> 34:16.000
this picture

34:16.239 --> 34:18.400
It was taken in Manager Luo's office

34:23.599 --> 34:25.400
So I conclude

34:25.800 --> 34:27.800
This letter to Mr. Yamashita

34:27.800 --> 34:29.079
It must be Manager Luo

34:29.079 --> 34:31.400
Or it was sent by one of his men.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.679
The formula must also be in the hands of Manager Luo

34:46.320 --> 34:47.239
Jiaping

34:47.880 --> 34:48.679
Jiaping

34:49.480 --> 34:50.320
eat some fruit

34:50.920 --> 34:51.760
Luo Guanqun

34:52.320 --> 34:53.159
He's finished

34:54.079 --> 34:55.000
What's the meaning

34:55.000 --> 34:56.119
Uchida already knows

34:56.519 --> 34:58.360
The person who traded with Yamashita was Luo Guanqun

34:59.360 --> 35:00.480
how did he know

35:01.079 --> 35:03.480
He arranged for Qian Xiucai to secretly investigate the matter

35:03.480 --> 35:04.679
When I just got you medicine

35:04.679 --> 35:07.400
I happened to hear Qian Xiucai reporting to Uchida.

35:10.880 --> 35:13.000
If Luo Guanqun collapses,

35:14.119 --> 35:15.360
Then we're all screwed

35:16.039 --> 35:17.000
Uchida also said

35:17.519 --> 35:19.920
Luo Guanqun and his men must be cut into pieces

35:20.639 --> 35:21.920
We need to evacuate quickly

35:21.920 --> 35:22.880
No more thinking

35:24.360 --> 35:24.960
no

35:25.239 --> 35:26.159
Why

35:27.440 --> 35:28.760
Has Luo Guanqun got any clues?

35:28.760 --> 35:29.960
Put it in this phone booth

35:29.960 --> 35:31.079
Only he knows this

35:31.480 --> 35:33.519
And only he has a clue to the formula

35:33.840 --> 35:34.800
We ran away at this time

35:34.800 --> 35:36.039
All the clues are broken

35:36.920 --> 35:38.199
What are you going to do?

35:46.679 --> 35:47.519
coming

35:54.760 --> 35:55.440
What's wrong

35:55.440 --> 35:56.280
Ruined

35:56.719 --> 35:57.880
What's over

35:58.559 --> 35:59.960
Uchida already knows

36:00.679 --> 36:02.760
You were the one who traded with Takeo Yamashita

36:05.239 --> 36:05.840
Shuyun

36:06.679 --> 36:07.559
You avoid it

36:07.559 --> 36:08.960
I have something to do with Jia Ping

36:13.960 --> 36:15.159
It's Jia Ping who's here

36:15.559 --> 36:16.320
sister in law

36:16.320 --> 36:17.320
Then you guys talk first

36:22.599 --> 36:23.679
how did he know

36:24.079 --> 36:25.280
Uchida arranges for Qian Xiucai

36:25.280 --> 36:26.480
Investigate this matter secretly

36:26.960 --> 36:29.480
Qian Xiucai found the remake recipe in the photo

36:29.480 --> 36:31.039
reflected glass

36:31.039 --> 36:32.679
Taken in your office

36:33.639 --> 36:34.840
Qian Xiucai

36:36.280 --> 36:38.039
This bastard

36:38.039 --> 36:39.679
Don't look at others as harmless animals

36:40.119 --> 36:41.880
In fact, it is harboring evil intentions

36:41.880 --> 36:43.320
Ambitious

36:43.840 --> 36:45.519
Then how did you know?

36:45.920 --> 36:47.519
Zuo Shuangtao went to the store to help me get medicine.

36:47.519 --> 36:49.199
Just look at your room lights on

36:49.199 --> 36:50.599
She went over to see what was going on

36:50.920 --> 36:52.559
I just heard the two of them talking.

36:53.000 --> 36:53.800
you

36:54.159 --> 36:55.920
And all your people

36:56.440 --> 36:57.760
Cut them all off

36:59.000 --> 36:59.760
Lao Luo

37:00.599 --> 37:02.000
We can't stay in the trading house anymore.

37:02.679 --> 37:03.639
only run

37:03.639 --> 37:05.079
The only way to save your life is to run

37:05.079 --> 37:05.760
do you know

37:08.480 --> 37:09.880
let me see

37:11.880 --> 37:12.880
What are you thinking about?

37:14.039 --> 37:15.880
Don't you have a hiding place?

37:19.800 --> 37:21.280
This place of business

37:23.000 --> 37:24.360
The secret is deep and the disaster is deep

37:25.679 --> 37:27.519
I thought there would be such a day

37:28.639 --> 37:30.719
But I didn't expect it to be so sudden

37:34.880 --> 37:35.639
And you

37:36.400 --> 37:37.119
what to do

37:37.440 --> 37:39.360
Zuo Shuangtao's aunt found a place for us

37:40.079 --> 37:40.920
Hide for a while

37:42.000 --> 37:42.639
good

37:44.599 --> 37:45.440
Jiaping

37:46.559 --> 37:47.679
Tired you up

37:48.880 --> 37:50.639
Don't even think about dragging me down in vain.

37:50.920 --> 37:51.960
Where is my gold bar?

37:54.239 --> 37:55.480
She doesn't know this

38:02.559 --> 38:03.679
I let the big spoon

38:04.159 --> 38:05.400
Take Shuyun there first

38:06.239 --> 38:07.400
I'll clean it up

38:07.400 --> 38:08.719
I'll clean it up with you

38:09.079 --> 38:10.159
Then I'll send you there

38:12.199 --> 38:13.840
You can't trust me

38:20.519 --> 38:21.280
Yes or no

38:21.840 --> 38:23.039
If it's Uchida

38:23.039 --> 38:24.719
You pretend you don't know anything

38:28.400 --> 38:29.119
Hello

38:30.800 --> 38:31.840
Chief Uchida

38:33.840 --> 38:35.159
now go

38:35.159 --> 38:36.239
Is there a problem

38:37.039 --> 38:39.360
OK OK

38:41.119 --> 38:41.840
How to say

38:42.760 --> 38:44.320
Let me go to the gendarmerie headquarters

38:44.320 --> 38:45.559
Talk about an emergency meeting

38:46.440 --> 38:48.239
There's no going back, Lao Luo

38:59.760 --> 39:00.679
Mrs. Luo

39:00.679 --> 39:01.360
do not worry

39:01.719 --> 39:03.280
That place is still safe

39:04.639 --> 39:06.119
Where are we going?

39:06.519 --> 39:07.119
longwuli

39:07.119 --> 39:08.199
Number three hundred and fifteen

39:10.079 --> 39:11.679
Do something for the Japanese?

39:11.679 --> 39:13.199
Sooner or later it will end like this

39:13.719 --> 39:16.440
Fortunately, Manager Luo is really foresighted.

39:16.440 --> 39:18.199
The road to Hong Kong has long been paved

39:31.039 --> 39:32.360
When has it been?

39:32.880 --> 39:34.119
Still caring about your wife so much

39:34.119 --> 39:35.280
Very affectionate between children

39:36.480 --> 39:37.840
From then on fell to the end of the world

39:37.840 --> 39:39.360
Only Shuyun can accompany me.

39:40.679 --> 39:41.360
And you

39:41.679 --> 39:42.679
Where are you going?

39:42.760 --> 39:43.360
I

39:44.159 --> 39:45.199
Go to Yan'an

39:45.880 --> 39:46.480
What

39:47.840 --> 39:50.280
Neither the Japanese nor the Chinese army will let me go.

39:50.679 --> 39:53.639
I can only go to Yan'an and join the Communist Party

39:55.119 --> 39:56.800
Looks a lot like the Communist Party

40:10.320 --> 40:10.920
correct

40:11.639 --> 40:13.880
Why did Zuo Shuangtao hear Uchida say

40:13.880 --> 40:16.000
Yamashita didn't get the formula at all.

40:16.880 --> 40:17.840
impossible

40:18.239 --> 40:19.079
I'll make the recipe

40:19.079 --> 40:21.159
I put it in the phone booth on Sanguantang Road.

40:21.480 --> 40:22.880
Sanguantang telephone booth

40:24.119 --> 40:25.400
Isn’t it Xiafei Road?

40:28.039 --> 40:29.519
That was used to test you

40:30.079 --> 40:31.840
Zhao An took the blame for the Five of Hearts

40:31.840 --> 40:33.880
The Five of Hearts is still in the store.

40:38.760 --> 40:40.119
It was Damasao's idea

40:40.119 --> 40:41.519
It really has nothing to do with me

40:44.880 --> 40:45.760
OK OK OK

40:46.199 --> 40:47.679
How do you relieve your anger?

40:47.920 --> 40:48.559
All right

40:49.039 --> 40:49.400
Anyway

40:50.639 --> 40:52.440
our time is over

40:53.400 --> 40:54.159
I ask you

40:54.760 --> 40:56.639
Why didn't Yamashita get the formula?

40:58.519 --> 40:59.320
how could I know

40:59.320 --> 41:00.920
You don’t know who knows?

41:03.079 --> 41:05.239
Why are you so concerned about the formula?

41:05.960 --> 41:07.519
You can’t really be a communist, right?

41:07.519 --> 41:08.519
You are talking nonsense

41:10.320 --> 41:12.440
I'm having a good time working in a business firm

41:12.440 --> 41:13.400
Not because of you

41:13.400 --> 41:15.159
I've become a street rat now

41:15.440 --> 41:17.199
You don't give people Yamashita's formula

41:17.480 --> 41:19.400
That's why Yamashita was angry about it

41:19.400 --> 41:21.480
You caught too many gold bars

41:21.480 --> 41:22.239
enough

41:22.239 --> 41:23.280
What should I do

41:23.280 --> 41:25.039
What should I do with Zuo Shuangtao?

41:33.039 --> 41:34.119
what are you going to do

41:35.280 --> 41:36.199
patrol

41:40.480 --> 41:41.800
Scared me

41:42.559 --> 41:44.440
Did you hide the recipe?

41:44.880 --> 41:47.079
Do you still have a chance to make another fortune?

41:47.079 --> 41:48.039
I don't

41:50.039 --> 41:50.880
Luo Guanqun

41:51.760 --> 41:52.920
Now I think about eating alone

41:52.920 --> 41:53.639
right

41:53.880 --> 41:54.960
I swear

41:54.960 --> 41:55.559
I really don't

41:55.559 --> 41:56.199
I tell you

41:56.199 --> 41:57.360
Why don't you tell me the truth

41:57.360 --> 41:58.519
The patrol is right next to it.

41:58.519 --> 41:59.519
I stepped on the accelerator and drove over

41:59.519 --> 42:00.239
Neither of us can escape

42:00.239 --> 42:00.920
OK OK OK

42:01.440 --> 42:02.360
I really swear to you

42:02.360 --> 42:03.320
I don't

42:04.079 --> 42:05.239
If I lie to you

42:05.880 --> 42:07.239
Let my wife cuckold me again

42:07.239 --> 42:08.039
Okay

42:16.719 --> 42:17.320
Then when will you

42:17.320 --> 42:19.079
Hidden this recipe in the phone booth

42:19.079 --> 42:19.880
last night

42:21.039 --> 42:22.039
Went alone

42:22.039 --> 42:22.840
one person

42:23.639 --> 42:24.599
No one follows

42:24.599 --> 42:25.239
No

42:36.360 --> 42:37.480
Mrs. Luo here

42:38.360 --> 42:38.880
Slow down a little

42:38.880 --> 42:40.079
It's not easy to walk

42:40.880 --> 42:42.199
Can't the car drive in?

42:42.199 --> 42:43.559
Can't get in here?

42:45.760 --> 42:46.719
Got here

42:49.519 --> 42:51.119
Why does it smell so bad here?

42:51.679 --> 42:53.119
We are on the run now

42:53.119 --> 42:53.920
Mrs. Luo

42:57.079 --> 42:59.480
I originally thought I could get both cash and goods.

42:59.960 --> 43:01.440
I thought it was quite beautiful

43:01.760 --> 43:04.480
I don’t want to provoke the devil Yamashita either.

43:04.480 --> 43:06.800
Why don't you tell me not to give him the formula?

43:08.800 --> 43:10.199
This is not a button

43:10.559 --> 43:11.679
It's cufflinks
