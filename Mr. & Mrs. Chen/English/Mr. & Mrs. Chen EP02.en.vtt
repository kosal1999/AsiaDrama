01:33.319 --> 01:34.159
Me and my girlfriend

01:34.159 --> 01:36.200
The two of us have been living apart in two places

01:36.640 --> 01:38.480
I don't even have a chance to introduce you to them.

01:39.159 --> 01:40.040
Moreover

01:40.680 --> 01:43.519
Ever since I worked under your hand

01:43.959 --> 01:46.439
I experienced the feasting and feasting of Shanghai with you

01:46.840 --> 01:47.560
A man

01:48.560 --> 01:50.640
This can never make life

01:50.640 --> 01:52.400
Missing some possibilities

01:54.799 --> 01:55.359
OK

01:56.000 --> 01:56.680
understand

01:58.319 --> 02:00.079
Which bus did your girlfriend take?

02:00.079 --> 02:01.239
What time did you arrive?

02:04.319 --> 02:05.239
Where did it come from?

02:06.400 --> 02:07.079
Wuhan

02:09.919 --> 02:12.120
From Wuhan to Shanghai via Xuzhou Tongshan

02:12.120 --> 02:13.000
429 degrees

02:13.319 --> 02:14.599
2:40 p.m.

02:14.800 --> 02:15.840
What time did you pick her up?

02:16.240 --> 02:17.080
It's past three o'clock

02:18.280 --> 02:19.479
She arrived at two forty

02:19.479 --> 02:21.280
Why did you pick her up after three o'clock?

02:22.599 --> 02:24.319
Jiaping said he would pick me up at exit A

02:24.840 --> 02:25.960
But it’s not like he doesn’t know

02:26.280 --> 02:27.439
I'm blind

02:27.759 --> 02:29.800
Where can I find the exit gate?

02:30.479 --> 02:32.199
How many times have I told her

02:32.520 --> 02:33.879
If you don’t know the way, ask more people.

02:33.879 --> 02:35.520
Then what can I do if she doesn't ask me?

02:35.759 --> 02:36.840
Then you

02:37.080 --> 02:38.280
Where have you been all this time?

02:38.280 --> 02:40.080
I've always been at Exit A

02:40.240 --> 02:42.319
Around Yamashita Assassination Clinic

02:42.599 --> 02:43.520
you haven't been

02:43.759 --> 02:44.240
No

02:44.800 --> 02:46.080
What am I doing there?

02:46.840 --> 02:48.960
Have you come to Shanghai to find him before?

02:49.159 --> 02:49.879
No

02:50.080 --> 02:52.199
Why do you come here now?

02:59.159 --> 03:00.319
Tell me as quickly as possible

03:00.319 --> 03:01.719
What are your specific circumstances in Wuhan?

03:01.879 --> 03:02.879
And living habits

03:02.879 --> 03:04.520
Also remember what I told you

03:07.000 --> 03:07.639
She

03:08.240 --> 03:10.520
I just think the work in Wuhan is too boring

03:10.879 --> 03:12.080
There is no future

03:12.199 --> 03:14.039
There happened to be an aunt in Shanghai

03:14.439 --> 03:15.280
Just want to say

03:15.719 --> 03:16.680
Come and see Shanghai

03:16.879 --> 03:17.520
big city

03:17.840 --> 03:18.599
There's a lot to be done

03:18.919 --> 03:20.000
Actually there is another reason

03:21.319 --> 03:22.520
Just come and look at me

03:25.159 --> 03:26.400
What's your girlfriend's job?

03:27.199 --> 03:29.000
A division under the Ministry of Finance

03:29.240 --> 03:30.080
What chamber

03:31.159 --> 03:32.000
accounting office

03:32.639 --> 03:34.800
Since you plan to live in Shanghai permanently

03:35.039 --> 03:36.159
Where is the luggage?

03:36.719 --> 03:38.400
Why don't you even have any luggage?

03:41.120 --> 03:42.439
Too much luggage

03:42.560 --> 03:43.800
How can I hold it?

03:44.159 --> 03:45.560
Three big boxes of bare clothes

03:45.919 --> 03:47.439
I must be lucky by water

03:47.759 --> 03:48.960
It will arrive in a few days

03:49.120 --> 03:51.400
Do you know what he does in Shanghai?

03:53.840 --> 03:55.240
Isn't it Taihe Trading Company?

03:56.240 --> 03:57.240
trading house

03:57.960 --> 03:59.240
Then it must be a business

04:00.599 --> 04:01.680
He showed off to me

04:01.879 --> 04:03.400
What kind of section chief is he?

04:03.400 --> 04:05.080
Did I tell you the address of the business office?

04:05.599 --> 04:06.360
I said it

04:07.599 --> 04:09.639
Jisi Feier Road, Huxi District, Shanghai

04:10.280 --> 04:11.120
No. 26

04:11.240 --> 04:12.439
how to contact you

04:12.919 --> 04:13.639
Call up

04:14.120 --> 04:14.879
write a letter

04:15.039 --> 04:16.600
What is the switchboard phone number of the business bank?

04:16.600 --> 04:17.160
explain

04:17.399 --> 04:18.319
I don't know this

04:19.879 --> 04:21.000
He called me all the time

04:21.560 --> 04:22.439
Men

04:22.800 --> 04:23.680
Be proactive

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
her phone

04:27.560 --> 04:29.800
I always call the Ministry of Finance switchboard.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.079
Then transfer to their department

04:34.120 --> 04:36.040
68333 to 197

04:36.040 --> 04:37.120
remember remember

04:37.120 --> 04:37.920
Oh My God

04:39.560 --> 04:41.160
Where are you and Miss Zuo?

04:41.160 --> 04:42.439
When did we meet

04:43.639 --> 04:44.800
You have to ask this too

04:47.160 --> 04:48.759
Autumn 1936

04:48.759 --> 04:49.480
Nanjing

04:50.759 --> 04:53.480
We are in the autumn of the 25th year of the Republic of China

04:54.000 --> 04:55.199
Met in October

04:55.199 --> 04:57.959
Where was your first date?

04:59.040 --> 05:00.879
Zhonghuamen Nei Confucius Temple

05:00.879 --> 05:02.079
movies to watch

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
crossroads

05:42.360 --> 05:43.160
who

05:44.360 --> 05:45.000
Don't, don't, don't

05:45.000 --> 05:45.800
Don't, don't, don't

05:46.319 --> 05:47.439
Never let go

05:48.759 --> 05:50.079
Are you scared to death?

05:50.839 --> 05:51.680
you police

05:51.680 --> 05:53.199
When shooting at our patriotic students

05:53.199 --> 05:54.399
Why not afraid

05:55.360 --> 05:56.639
No, I'm not a police officer

05:57.120 --> 05:58.720
I also participated in the patriotic parade

05:58.720 --> 05:59.720
I knocked out a policeman

05:59.720 --> 06:00.600
changed his clothes

06:00.600 --> 06:01.639
And stole his car

06:01.759 --> 06:03.959
What I want is to take all these things away

06:05.000 --> 06:06.240
Why should I believe you?

06:13.240 --> 06:14.040
look

06:14.319 --> 06:15.319
I also have a red armband

06:15.439 --> 06:16.279
Same as you

06:19.279 --> 06:20.959
But many classmates died

06:21.759 --> 06:23.439
It's easy to get an armband like this

06:23.720 --> 06:24.240
no

06:27.199 --> 06:28.160
Don't be nervous

06:28.439 --> 06:29.639
you have my gun

06:29.639 --> 06:30.240
facing me

06:30.399 --> 06:31.959
Then I'll go find the latch

06:33.360 --> 06:34.519
Don't, don't, don't

06:35.279 --> 06:36.240
Don't get mad

06:36.839 --> 06:38.040
Where did you throw the latch?

06:43.079 --> 06:43.399
no

06:43.399 --> 06:44.240
You are hurt

06:47.480 --> 06:47.920
so

06:49.319 --> 06:50.839
I'd better help you stop bleeding first.

06:50.839 --> 06:51.360
ok

06:52.120 --> 06:52.920
Don't, don't, don't

06:53.079 --> 06:53.839
Don't face me

06:54.040 --> 06:54.800
sit down

06:56.279 --> 06:57.439
Slow down, slow down, slow down

06:59.519 --> 07:00.480
Let me take a look

07:06.920 --> 07:08.279
What school do you go to

07:10.480 --> 07:11.800
south nanjing

07:12.920 --> 07:14.399
Finance College

07:14.399 --> 07:15.319
Bear with it

07:15.639 --> 07:16.920
What's your name

07:17.480 --> 07:18.480
Zuo Shuangtao

07:20.040 --> 07:21.920
My classmates all call me Guoguo

07:22.319 --> 07:23.199
Guoguo

07:24.759 --> 07:26.319
That's a nice name

07:26.800 --> 07:27.839
Be patient, be patient

07:27.839 --> 07:28.319
alright

07:30.600 --> 07:31.399
But you you

07:31.720 --> 07:33.319
Why do you have grenades?

07:33.800 --> 07:36.959
Our parade was shot at

07:37.319 --> 07:39.439
The organizer of the march was seriously injured

07:40.000 --> 07:41.279
The grenade he gave me

07:41.920 --> 07:43.279
He also told me this address

07:43.279 --> 07:45.160
Said there was very important information here

07:45.680 --> 07:47.399
We cannot fall into the hands of the reactionary police

07:52.000 --> 07:52.720
But

07:52.879 --> 07:53.759
The two of us are spending time here

07:53.759 --> 07:54.639
It's not a problem either

07:54.959 --> 07:56.360
The police will chase you soon

07:59.120 --> 07:59.959
Otherwise

08:00.600 --> 08:01.879
Do you believe what I say

08:03.399 --> 08:05.000
When I say loosen up, just loosen up.

08:05.279 --> 08:06.519
Don't be afraid

08:06.519 --> 08:08.079
Just treat it like the two of us watching a movie

08:08.480 --> 08:09.680
Have you seen Crossroads?

08:12.879 --> 08:13.800
Are you ready?

08:17.800 --> 08:18.360
three

08:19.079 --> 08:19.720
two

08:20.439 --> 08:20.959
one

08:21.600 --> 08:22.120
loose

08:23.959 --> 08:24.720
Oh my god

08:24.720 --> 08:25.120
wait for me a while

08:25.120 --> 08:26.160
Let me deal with it first

08:36.360 --> 08:37.320
Go, go, go

08:39.080 --> 08:39.559
Walk

08:40.799 --> 08:41.840
What should I do with this thing?

08:41.840 --> 08:42.600
Leave it alone

08:42.600 --> 08:43.919
Leave the rest to me

08:48.960 --> 08:50.080
I think it's almost the same

08:51.080 --> 08:52.240
Zhao An, this bastard

08:52.600 --> 08:53.600
No big deal

08:53.840 --> 08:55.080
I have to struggle until now

08:59.039 --> 08:59.519
correct

09:00.480 --> 09:01.799
I heard Zhao An say

09:01.799 --> 09:03.759
When he picked you up at the train station

09:04.200 --> 09:05.080
Miss Zuo said

09:05.440 --> 09:07.279
Are you going to Wing On Mall?

09:08.120 --> 09:09.720
But the direction you are going

09:09.879 --> 09:10.840
It's southwest

09:11.039 --> 09:12.960
Wing On Shopping Center is in the north

09:14.080 --> 09:15.039
Did she lie?

09:18.159 --> 09:19.080
Miss Zuo

09:19.679 --> 09:21.840
You said you came to Shanghai from Wuhan

09:22.440 --> 09:23.200
That's right

09:23.960 --> 09:25.759
can i have a look at your ticket

09:43.480 --> 09:45.000
She did lie

09:57.879 --> 09:58.480
Biased a bit

10:06.879 --> 10:07.720
What's this

10:07.720 --> 10:08.559
sachet

10:08.759 --> 10:09.720
Never seen it

10:10.720 --> 10:11.440
never seen it

10:13.440 --> 10:14.120
good smell

10:14.639 --> 10:15.519
where did it come from

10:15.799 --> 10:17.159
Bought at the train station

10:20.679 --> 10:22.120
Bought at the train station

10:29.799 --> 10:31.279
This sachet is very good

10:31.919 --> 10:32.919
I would also like

10:45.840 --> 10:47.840
Love is difficult

10:47.840 --> 10:48.320
Oh My God

10:48.320 --> 10:49.720
Why don't you read it out?

10:50.720 --> 10:52.080
Can you save some face for me?

10:52.080 --> 10:53.080
Are you ashamed?

10:53.440 --> 10:55.159
My girlfriend finally came here

10:55.159 --> 10:56.840
We haven't seen each other for so long

10:57.480 --> 10:59.600
Who can think of going to the mall, right?

11:00.399 --> 11:01.519
dry firewood

11:21.759 --> 11:22.960
What are you laughing laughing

11:25.840 --> 11:27.000
you boy

11:27.600 --> 11:29.200
Wouldn't it be over if you told me earlier?

11:31.440 --> 11:32.240
Team Leader Zhao

11:32.799 --> 11:34.320
Have you finished asking all the questions?

11:35.039 --> 11:36.480
I still want to take advantage of the dawn

11:36.879 --> 11:38.120
Going out for shopping

11:38.440 --> 11:39.799
Miss Zuo, don't worry

11:41.039 --> 11:43.039
I want to introduce someone to you

11:56.919 --> 11:58.159
please come here

12:10.000 --> 12:10.799
Fangfang

12:11.480 --> 12:12.639
Captain Zhao

12:13.399 --> 12:15.080
What do you want me to do?

12:15.919 --> 12:16.960
Beautiful again

12:17.559 --> 12:18.279
Thanks

12:19.080 --> 12:20.480
I want to ask you something

12:20.919 --> 12:22.360
are you

12:22.759 --> 12:24.639
I really like Chen Jiaping

12:27.960 --> 12:28.759
What for?

12:29.759 --> 12:31.559
I'm not allowed to like people yet

12:32.000 --> 12:33.159
Very lenient

12:33.679 --> 12:35.000
It's not not allowed

12:35.559 --> 12:36.360
care

12:36.559 --> 12:38.360
Are you concerned about the living conditions of your employees?

12:39.759 --> 12:40.440
What about him?

12:41.159 --> 12:42.799
Does Jiaping like you too?

12:43.080 --> 12:44.440
That's natural

12:46.279 --> 12:49.360
Does Captain Zhao think we are a good match?

12:50.200 --> 12:50.879
a good match

12:51.240 --> 12:52.960
What a perfect match

12:53.840 --> 12:54.759
such a pity

12:55.440 --> 12:56.919
I'm just better than my family

12:57.440 --> 12:58.399
How old are you?

13:00.200 --> 13:01.240
Fangfang

13:01.240 --> 13:02.720
What age is this?

13:02.919 --> 13:04.679
Popular sister-brother romance

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Be confident

13:07.159 --> 13:08.960
When will we be invited to a wedding banquet?

13:08.960 --> 13:09.799
Eat wedding candy

13:10.159 --> 13:11.639
Then it depends on Jia Ping

13:11.639 --> 13:13.399
When did you propose to me?

13:14.200 --> 13:14.919
Soon

13:18.360 --> 13:19.320
Miss Zuo

13:19.559 --> 13:21.320
I don't want to ruin your relationship

13:22.200 --> 13:24.519
Actually, I'm here to help you

13:24.840 --> 13:25.759
how to help me

13:26.559 --> 13:27.919
I tell the truth

13:27.919 --> 13:29.759
I didn't doubt you

13:30.240 --> 13:31.440
You are a weak woman

13:31.679 --> 13:33.440
Looks so beautiful

13:34.440 --> 13:36.879
How could it be related to Yamashita's assassination?

13:37.480 --> 13:38.759
our real purpose

13:39.120 --> 13:40.759
To investigate Chen Jiaping

13:44.440 --> 13:45.960
Why investigate Chen Jiaping?

13:47.200 --> 13:48.279
Let me tell you this

13:48.960 --> 13:50.759
Chen Jiaping appeared at the train station

13:51.200 --> 13:53.759
If I didn’t make an appointment with you to pick you up

13:53.759 --> 13:55.159
Then he is very likely

13:55.279 --> 13:57.000
Related to Yamashita's assassination

13:57.000 --> 13:58.840
or with another

13:58.840 --> 14:01.559
Related to a case involving underground organizations of the Chinese Communist Party

14:03.559 --> 14:04.759
you just heard

14:05.279 --> 14:06.960
Chen Jiaping emotionally

14:06.960 --> 14:08.639
Not very dedicated to you

14:09.279 --> 14:11.279
You don't need to protect him, right?

14:12.799 --> 14:14.360
tell me the truth

14:14.600 --> 14:15.639
are you

14:15.759 --> 14:18.039
I just happened to meet Chen Jiaping at the train station

14:18.039 --> 14:19.240
Then you were used by him

14:19.919 --> 14:20.679
Miss Zuo

14:21.080 --> 14:22.559
if you tell me the truth

14:24.039 --> 14:26.039
I'll let you go shopping right away

14:30.080 --> 14:30.720
okay

14:30.720 --> 14:32.720
I'll show this to the Japanese

14:32.960 --> 14:34.320
It should be almost fine

14:34.720 --> 14:36.240
You can go back

14:58.440 --> 14:59.080
What's wrong

15:01.240 --> 15:02.200
Chen Jiaping

15:02.200 --> 15:03.919
You are so interesting

15:04.639 --> 15:05.960
Forget it if you lie to Zhao An

15:06.200 --> 15:07.519
You still lied to me

15:08.279 --> 15:09.320
What did I lie to you about?

15:09.320 --> 15:10.360
You're still pretending

15:11.519 --> 15:12.799
Zuo Shuangtao recognized it

15:13.440 --> 15:15.559
She hasn't contacted you for a long time.

15:15.960 --> 15:17.919
I came to Shanghai to visit my aunt.

15:18.480 --> 15:20.279
I happened to bump into you at the train station

15:20.960 --> 15:22.240
You have to ask her

15:22.879 --> 15:24.039
Said you picked her up

15:24.039 --> 15:25.159
Let her cooperate with you

15:27.759 --> 15:28.919
You go to the train station

15:29.320 --> 15:30.679
What on earth are you going to do?

15:31.279 --> 15:32.679
Don’t tell Zhao An

15:33.240 --> 15:34.360
Can't you tell me?

15:35.159 --> 15:37.000
I don't know what you are going to do?

15:37.679 --> 15:38.919
Just this little deal

15:39.279 --> 15:40.559
Private purchase and sale

15:40.559 --> 15:42.639
Are you the only one doing this in the business?

15:42.960 --> 15:44.679
What can you do if you tell me?

15:44.679 --> 15:46.200
If you have something to do, I'll take care of it for you.

15:46.200 --> 15:47.360
what are you afraid of

15:50.039 --> 15:53.000
You may not understand the situation yet

15:53.799 --> 15:55.679
Your things are trivial

15:56.399 --> 15:57.720
The story of Zuo Shuangtao

15:58.080 --> 15:58.879
Big

16:01.080 --> 16:02.399
When Yamashita was killed

16:02.399 --> 16:04.679
Zuo Shuangtao is within the range of activities

16:04.799 --> 16:06.360
Decide her now

16:06.840 --> 16:08.320
An associate of the assassin

16:10.840 --> 16:12.080
fellow assassin

16:12.279 --> 16:13.320
I tell you

16:13.720 --> 16:16.039
Don't let this old relationship

16:16.879 --> 16:18.919
Let Zuo Shuangtao take advantage of you

16:27.840 --> 16:29.320
tell me the truth

16:30.159 --> 16:31.919
You don’t know Zuo Shuangtao

16:32.320 --> 16:34.120
I happened to meet you at the train station

16:34.399 --> 16:36.240
She asked you

16:36.799 --> 16:37.799
take her out

16:37.799 --> 16:38.639
Coordinate her

16:39.200 --> 16:39.879
Yes or no

16:40.720 --> 16:42.080
Communist Party associates

16:46.120 --> 16:47.120
Let me tell you the truth

16:47.759 --> 16:48.480
you say

16:50.200 --> 16:51.440
My truth is

16:52.080 --> 16:55.320
Luo Guanqun, you are a bastard.

16:56.320 --> 16:58.399
I have treated you as my big brother for so many years

16:58.480 --> 17:00.759
Now you turn around and falsely confess to me.

17:02.240 --> 17:03.039
I tell you

17:03.519 --> 17:05.440
I went to the train station to pick up my girlfriend

17:05.720 --> 17:07.240
She came to Shanghai to find me

17:07.240 --> 17:08.119
I say this today

17:08.119 --> 17:09.160
She said so too

17:09.319 --> 17:10.920
because that's the truth

17:11.799 --> 17:12.440
Team Leader Zhao

17:13.880 --> 17:15.160
I want to go shopping

17:17.160 --> 17:17.799
OK

17:18.440 --> 17:19.519
I'll send you a car

17:19.680 --> 17:20.279
Need not

17:21.079 --> 17:22.160
Jia Ping will take me there

17:22.720 --> 17:24.200
If he is really with that Lu Fangfang

17:24.200 --> 17:24.920
have what

17:24.920 --> 17:26.240
Of course I won't let him go

17:26.759 --> 17:28.680
But what you said is all nonsense

17:29.000 --> 17:30.640
I'm here to see Chen Jiaping

17:30.960 --> 17:33.200
Jia Ping went to the train station to pick me up.

17:33.559 --> 17:34.240
I'm not in the mood

17:34.240 --> 17:36.039
I keep repeating these two sentences to you.

17:36.599 --> 17:37.319
Do you believe it or not?

17:37.319 --> 17:38.440
If you don’t believe it, take me away

17:38.759 --> 17:39.480
Take it away quickly

17:40.279 --> 17:40.759
Don't

17:40.920 --> 17:41.920
Hurry up

17:41.920 --> 17:43.400
Come on, come on, stop grinding

17:43.400 --> 17:44.640
You are really

17:45.559 --> 17:46.319
Chen Jiaping, where are you?

17:46.319 --> 17:47.039
come out

17:47.720 --> 17:48.279
Chen Jiaping

17:48.839 --> 17:49.559
What's wrong

17:50.680 --> 17:51.319
Jiaping

17:52.000 --> 17:53.359
Please give me a good explanation

17:54.119 --> 17:56.000
What's going on between you and Lu Fangfang?

17:57.039 --> 17:57.720
no

17:57.839 --> 17:59.599
You can just interrogate both of us.

17:59.599 --> 18:01.039
Why did you drag Lu Fangfang into this?

18:01.279 --> 18:01.960
Misunderstand

18:02.319 --> 18:03.519
It must have been done by Zhao An

18:03.920 --> 18:05.440
He fooled me all

18:07.559 --> 18:08.240
Did you hear that?

18:08.720 --> 18:09.440
Misunderstand

18:10.319 --> 18:11.799
It's not what you think

18:17.680 --> 18:18.240
elder brother

18:18.359 --> 18:20.039
That Zuo Shuangtao will not be tried.

18:20.119 --> 18:21.000
Not without trial

18:21.000 --> 18:22.079
Examine in another way

18:22.640 --> 18:23.880
I know Luo Guanqun

18:23.880 --> 18:25.680
That crappy thing doesn't work

18:26.519 --> 18:27.319
How's the assassin doing?

18:27.920 --> 18:28.799
Not dead yet

18:28.799 --> 18:30.240
But I can't last much longer.

18:30.440 --> 18:31.400
What about the cold dew?

18:31.759 --> 18:32.839
On the way, almost there

18:33.680 --> 18:34.759
Find Gao Fang

18:35.359 --> 18:37.680
His skills are put to use

18:37.839 --> 18:38.519
clear

18:40.039 --> 18:41.759
I'm going to report to Chief Kimura

18:42.279 --> 18:43.160
Next

18:43.480 --> 18:44.920
It's my turn to sing this play

18:48.400 --> 18:50.160
Isn't this just a formality?

18:50.680 --> 18:51.519
do not mind

18:51.839 --> 18:52.960
Shanghai beach is fun

18:52.960 --> 18:54.279
It’s time to eat and go shopping

18:54.279 --> 18:55.119
what do you need

18:55.400 --> 18:56.039
Tell me

18:56.279 --> 18:57.759
You got it, you Lao Luo

18:58.440 --> 18:59.720
How can you think of that?

19:00.000 --> 19:00.799
Also shopping

19:00.799 --> 19:01.559
Still eating

19:04.559 --> 19:05.559
Let's go have a meal

19:06.000 --> 19:06.319
Walk

19:06.559 --> 19:07.599
Still eating?

19:08.079 --> 19:09.759
Have you made it clear about Lu Fangfang?

19:09.759 --> 19:10.920
It's okay

19:10.920 --> 19:11.720
misunderstanding misunderstanding

19:11.839 --> 19:12.839
This is all a misunderstanding

19:13.160 --> 19:14.359
Huayou Building at night

19:14.519 --> 19:15.240
my treat

19:18.839 --> 19:19.559
you two

19:19.559 --> 19:20.599
No one is allowed to leave

19:22.200 --> 19:24.240
Zhao An, what else do you want to do?

19:24.519 --> 19:25.799
There is new evidence

19:26.079 --> 19:28.039
Continue to be investigated

19:28.359 --> 19:30.279
What new evidence do you have?

19:31.519 --> 19:32.880
Chief Kimura’s order

19:52.559 --> 19:53.599
It's so late

19:54.240 --> 19:56.039
What the hell is Zhao An up to?

20:14.960 --> 20:15.720
Zhao An

20:15.960 --> 20:16.880
What is this?

20:18.319 --> 20:19.440
german guy

20:35.039 --> 20:36.319
Hello Miss Hanlu

20:37.599 --> 20:38.440
You are looking for me

20:39.000 --> 20:39.920
What do you want to ask?

20:40.400 --> 20:43.240
I heard you were in danger at the train station today

20:43.960 --> 20:44.559
yes

20:45.559 --> 20:46.200
What's wrong

20:47.799 --> 20:49.119
I heard that there was a man

20:49.119 --> 20:50.839
I pushed you away in time

20:50.839 --> 20:52.599
Just to save you from disaster

20:53.000 --> 20:53.359
right

20:53.759 --> 20:54.640
that person

20:55.160 --> 20:56.119
do you know

20:57.559 --> 20:58.319
do not know

21:03.920 --> 21:05.559
Look, is it him?

21:11.400 --> 21:13.279
I don't quite understand what you mean

21:15.880 --> 21:17.039
Colonel Takeo Yamashita

21:17.039 --> 21:17.839
Miss Hanlu

21:18.240 --> 21:19.559
I must know him

21:21.400 --> 21:22.680
he is my friend

21:22.680 --> 21:24.559
I heard that when I was in Manchuria

21:25.039 --> 21:26.200
Colonel Takeo Yamashita

21:26.200 --> 21:27.599
Several films have been arranged

21:27.839 --> 21:29.559
Movies produced by Manying allow you to act

21:29.759 --> 21:31.400
You two have a deep relationship

21:31.799 --> 21:33.279
What exactly do you want to ask?

21:33.720 --> 21:35.799
Colonel Yamashita Takeo today

21:36.039 --> 21:38.359
stabbed at train station

21:38.359 --> 21:39.599
dead

21:40.160 --> 21:41.200
do you know

21:42.519 --> 21:43.759
Death under the mountain

21:44.960 --> 21:46.319
This person’s name is Chen Jiaping

21:46.319 --> 21:48.440
I suspect he has something to do with the assassination

21:49.240 --> 21:50.839
You are the key witness

21:52.960 --> 21:53.599
I

21:54.559 --> 21:55.680
he insisted

21:55.920 --> 21:58.480
He has been at the exit of the train station

21:58.839 --> 22:01.079
Didn't go near the area where Yamashita was assassinated.

22:01.759 --> 22:04.039
But the scene of your assassination

22:04.039 --> 22:06.119
Very close to the scene of Yamashita's assassination

22:06.240 --> 22:07.960
If he is the one who saves you

22:08.839 --> 22:11.480
That proves that Chen Jiaping lied

22:12.519 --> 22:14.200
I think of course you won't protect anyone

22:14.200 --> 22:16.359
The murderer who assassinated Yamashita Takeo?

22:17.319 --> 22:18.200
of course not

22:19.960 --> 22:20.920
the person who saved you

22:21.599 --> 22:22.440
It's him, right?

22:23.400 --> 22:23.920
yes

22:25.599 --> 22:28.079
The person who saved me was Chen Jiaping

22:33.240 --> 22:33.880
Jiaping

22:34.759 --> 22:36.200
You don’t have to tell me in a hurry

22:36.200 --> 22:37.759
why do you lie

22:38.759 --> 22:40.640
Let's listen to the next one

22:42.079 --> 22:43.359
your name

22:46.960 --> 22:47.880
Feng Qi

22:48.200 --> 22:49.480
Pull out one of his nails

your name

22:58.559 --> 23:00.839
Li Li Daxuan

23:03.960 --> 23:06.559
Who sent you to assassinate Takeo Yamashita?

23:07.839 --> 23:09.440
group organization

23:10.079 --> 23:11.119
What organization

23:11.920 --> 23:13.960
I only know that we are anti-Japanese

23:15.400 --> 23:17.039
Accept orders from superiors

23:17.920 --> 23:19.720
No other questions are allowed

23:20.160 --> 23:21.440
The one who ran away

23:21.720 --> 23:23.200
Are we in the same group as you?

23:23.920 --> 23:24.720
yes

23:25.480 --> 23:26.640
I know him

23:30.119 --> 23:31.720
we are in the same group

23:32.000 --> 23:33.240
What's his name

23:35.039 --> 23:36.240
His name is A Kun

23:37.640 --> 23:38.720
Except Akun

23:39.759 --> 23:41.519
Are there any other accomplices?

23:42.559 --> 23:43.359
there is none left

23:44.240 --> 23:45.200
Pull out nails again

23:53.640 --> 23:54.279
Feng Qi

24:01.519 --> 24:02.119
look

24:03.480 --> 24:04.440
let him see

24:08.279 --> 24:09.720
This woman named Zuo Shuangtao

24:09.720 --> 24:10.759
do you know

24:11.119 --> 24:12.880
Is she on your side?

24:16.079 --> 24:17.440
take all his nails

24:18.200 --> 24:19.400
All pulled out

24:22.640 --> 24:23.160
don't want

24:25.640 --> 24:26.279
I said

24:27.480 --> 24:28.200
I said

24:29.839 --> 24:30.720
I know her

24:34.359 --> 24:35.680
we are in the same group

24:40.079 --> 24:40.960
Chen Jiaping

24:41.920 --> 24:43.200
you lied

24:44.480 --> 24:45.359
Miss Double Peach

24:45.359 --> 24:46.799
You lied too

24:47.400 --> 24:49.160
Confessions of Daxuan and Hanlu

24:49.359 --> 24:50.720
It explains everything

25:00.559 --> 25:01.200
Zhao An

25:01.839 --> 25:03.799
I'll leave this matter to you.

25:07.480 --> 25:08.079
etc.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.279
What else do you have to say

25:13.720 --> 25:15.079
can i listen to it again

25:17.759 --> 25:18.559
good

25:18.599 --> 25:19.480
listen again

25:19.920 --> 25:21.000
Manager Na Luo

25:21.599 --> 25:24.200
I feel sorry for you and listen carefully again

25:29.720 --> 25:30.319
etc.

25:30.960 --> 25:31.720
what are you doing

25:32.200 --> 25:33.039
Captain Zhao

25:33.319 --> 25:34.519
Can I do it?

25:36.000 --> 25:36.839
Do you know

25:36.960 --> 25:37.720
Okay

25:51.599 --> 25:52.920
Hello Miss Hanlu

25:53.839 --> 25:55.039
You are looking for me

25:55.400 --> 25:56.200
What do you want to ask?

25:57.000 --> 25:59.799
I heard you were in danger at the train station today

26:00.599 --> 26:01.119
yes

26:02.160 --> 26:02.799
What's wrong

26:04.440 --> 26:05.680
I heard that there was a man

26:05.680 --> 26:07.319
I pushed you away in time

26:07.480 --> 26:09.160
Just to save you from disaster

26:09.759 --> 26:10.240
right

26:10.640 --> 26:11.519
that person

26:12.079 --> 26:13.119
do you know

26:22.200 --> 26:22.759
yes

26:24.359 --> 26:26.799
The person who saved me was Chen Jiaping

26:28.519 --> 26:30.000
Aren't you okay?

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
Don't mess up

26:34.720 --> 26:35.279
yes

26:36.920 --> 26:39.359
The person who saved me was Chen Jiaping

26:47.240 --> 26:47.880
Captain Zhao

26:49.440 --> 26:50.640
Zuo Shuangtao's recording

26:50.640 --> 26:51.960
I also want to hear it again

26:52.440 --> 26:53.279
casual

27:03.160 --> 27:04.519
your name

27:04.799 --> 27:07.119
Li Li Daxuan

27:07.960 --> 27:09.240
The one who ran away

27:09.519 --> 27:10.920
Are we in the same group as you?

27:11.079 --> 27:12.319
What's his name

27:12.640 --> 27:13.279
yes

27:14.519 --> 27:15.400
I know him

27:18.720 --> 27:20.039
we are in the same group

27:22.000 --> 27:23.079
His name is A Kun

27:27.240 --> 27:27.960
Captain Zhao

27:28.640 --> 27:30.440
You're so good at joking

27:31.119 --> 27:32.559
What am I kidding you?

27:36.160 --> 27:37.519
good recording

27:38.400 --> 27:40.240
Why did you edit it?

27:44.160 --> 27:45.559
has been edited

27:46.079 --> 27:47.200
do you have evidence

27:50.440 --> 27:52.880
are you kidding me

27:53.720 --> 27:55.319
Let me analyze it

27:56.400 --> 27:57.279
Lao Luo

27:57.759 --> 28:00.200
Do you hear the sound of water dripping in the background?

28:00.960 --> 28:02.440
Water leaks in recording studio

28:02.880 --> 28:04.519
It's normal to use a basin to connect it

28:04.519 --> 28:06.279
Yes, it's normal

28:06.279 --> 28:07.519
listen again

28:12.359 --> 28:13.640
Listen carefully

28:15.640 --> 28:16.319
yes

28:17.799 --> 28:20.400
The person who saved me was Chen Jiaping

28:26.759 --> 28:28.359
I didn't hear it

28:28.680 --> 28:29.640
First half of recording

28:29.640 --> 28:31.400
The sound of water dripping is indeed uniform

28:31.400 --> 28:33.359
But why did you reach the last sentence?

28:33.759 --> 28:35.240
The sound of water dripping became faster and slower

28:35.680 --> 28:37.000
Do you know why

28:37.519 --> 28:40.279
Is the person who saved you Chen Jiaping?

28:41.759 --> 28:42.319
Miss Hanlu

28:42.480 --> 28:44.160
I am your movie fan. Please sign it for me.

28:51.799 --> 28:52.559
no

28:52.880 --> 28:54.079
save my person

28:54.720 --> 28:55.799
Not Chen Jiaping

28:57.119 --> 28:57.920
besides

28:57.920 --> 28:59.559
Don't rush to explain

28:59.559 --> 29:00.279
Lao Luo

29:00.559 --> 29:02.559
Let’s listen to Li Daxuan’s conversation again

29:08.039 --> 29:08.880
yes

29:09.759 --> 29:10.559
I know him

29:14.000 --> 29:15.400
we are in the same group

29:17.359 --> 29:18.720
His name is A Kun

29:19.640 --> 29:21.279
remember this sentence

29:21.279 --> 29:22.319
I know him

29:23.480 --> 29:24.640
we are in the same group

29:25.359 --> 29:26.519
Listen to the second half of his part

29:26.720 --> 29:28.200
This woman named Zuo Shuangtao

29:28.200 --> 29:29.160
do you know

29:29.559 --> 29:31.480
Is she on your side?

29:31.920 --> 29:33.599
take all his nails

29:34.160 --> 29:35.559
All pulled out

29:36.279 --> 29:36.920
don't want

29:39.160 --> 29:39.799
I said

29:40.960 --> 29:41.880
I said

29:43.359 --> 29:44.440
I know him

29:47.920 --> 29:49.319
we are in the same group

29:49.640 --> 29:51.079
I know him

29:52.319 --> 29:53.920
we are in the same group

29:53.920 --> 29:54.680
Captain Zhao

29:56.480 --> 29:57.480
a word

29:57.839 --> 29:59.519
Li Daxuan said it twice

30:00.039 --> 30:02.400
They all coughed in the same place.

30:02.400 --> 30:03.599
Do you think it's a coincidence?

30:04.799 --> 30:05.720
I don't think

30:06.039 --> 30:07.039
but i think

30:07.400 --> 30:11.680
Captain Zhao used one sentence twice.

30:15.720 --> 30:17.079
I do not know her

30:20.920 --> 30:22.319
I do not know her

30:25.720 --> 30:26.559
died

30:27.400 --> 30:28.240
play high

30:29.359 --> 30:30.359
Can it be handled?

30:32.559 --> 30:34.119
Don't worry, it's no problem

30:41.359 --> 30:42.240
Zhao An

30:42.640 --> 30:44.480
You are so audacious

30:45.559 --> 30:46.759
Jia Ping is one of his own

30:47.359 --> 30:49.200
Zuo Shuangtao is Jia Ping’s girlfriend

30:49.200 --> 30:50.519
Also considered one of our own

30:50.559 --> 30:52.160
You use such despicable means

30:52.160 --> 30:52.920
Trick them

30:53.599 --> 30:56.079
The same routine that played badly before

30:57.599 --> 30:59.000
is yours

30:59.000 --> 31:00.920
Don't blame it all on me

31:00.920 --> 31:01.920
You're talking nonsense

31:04.279 --> 31:05.279
I command you

31:05.680 --> 31:06.839
Release me immediately

31:08.559 --> 31:09.640
immediately

31:17.359 --> 31:18.359
Can you go?

31:18.359 --> 31:18.799
Can you go?

31:47.119 --> 31:48.240
Let's go

31:50.039 --> 31:51.119
why did you leave

31:51.119 --> 31:52.039
Dining at Huayou Building

31:52.039 --> 31:52.960
my treat

31:55.799 --> 31:56.720
my eldest brother

32:00.240 --> 32:01.279
Miss Zuo

32:01.279 --> 32:02.920
I didn't take good care of myself today

32:02.920 --> 32:06.319
Both you and Jia Ping were frightened.

32:06.720 --> 32:08.960
Come on, come on, I'll punish myself with a drink

32:09.960 --> 32:10.880
Punish yourself with a drink

32:17.920 --> 32:21.039
Anyway, that Zhao An won’t be able to dance for long.

32:21.240 --> 32:23.039
Thirty-six thunder boss fights autumn

32:23.039 --> 32:24.599
I'll settle the score with him again in the future.

32:25.559 --> 32:26.880
I won’t talk about this today

32:26.880 --> 32:28.599
Take this bite and I'll respect you again

32:32.640 --> 32:33.519
frightened

32:34.920 --> 32:36.799
Jia Ping told me before

32:36.799 --> 32:39.079
Work in a Sino-Japanese joint venture firm

32:39.279 --> 32:40.640
I thought

32:40.640 --> 32:42.599
He is making money and enjoying happiness

32:43.160 --> 32:44.319
I did not expect

32:44.920 --> 32:46.799
Daqing is a devil's cave

32:48.559 --> 32:49.160
yes

32:49.839 --> 32:51.039
There are no outsiders here either

32:51.039 --> 32:52.759
I might as well tell you straight

32:52.759 --> 32:54.519
We work for the Japanese

32:55.200 --> 32:55.799
Beat, kill, kill

32:55.799 --> 32:57.119
The matter of using knives and guns

32:58.039 --> 32:59.160
That's inevitable

32:59.680 --> 33:00.480
Got it

33:00.880 --> 33:02.640
It turns out to be a traitor's den

33:05.519 --> 33:08.079
Miss Zuo is very outspoken.

33:08.079 --> 33:08.799
I like

33:17.799 --> 33:19.079
By the way, Miss Zuo

33:19.480 --> 33:20.279
I heard Jia Ping say

33:20.279 --> 33:21.359
You come to Shanghai

33:21.640 --> 33:23.319
Are you interested in finding a job?

33:23.319 --> 33:24.240
Have you thought about it?

33:25.160 --> 33:26.599
No idea yet

33:27.680 --> 33:30.519
I will decide after visiting my aunt

33:31.759 --> 33:32.839
Where does your aunt live?

33:34.119 --> 33:34.880
Yu Gongguan

33:36.440 --> 33:37.200
where

33:37.799 --> 33:39.599
Mr. Yu Shanren's residence

33:41.319 --> 33:42.920
Working as a servant there

33:45.880 --> 33:48.359
My aunt is the eldest wife of Mr. Yu Shanren

33:48.920 --> 33:49.720
Zheng Yumei

33:50.599 --> 33:51.640
Yeah

33:51.640 --> 33:53.160
But she's not my aunt

33:53.960 --> 33:55.119
She's my mother's cousin

33:56.319 --> 33:57.000
Mr. Yu

33:57.000 --> 33:59.920
That's the chairman of Sanbei Ferry Port Company.

33:59.920 --> 34:02.240
Another famous financial tycoon

34:02.240 --> 34:04.559
He is also the president of Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce

34:04.559 --> 34:06.759
Even the Japanese have to look up to him.

34:07.759 --> 34:08.800
Chen Jiaping

34:08.800 --> 34:10.039
Your girlfriend

34:10.039 --> 34:12.079
The background is quite amazing

34:13.519 --> 34:14.519
Why don’t you make a toast quickly?

34:14.519 --> 34:15.320
Come on

34:15.360 --> 34:16.840
Miss Zuo, here’s a toast to you

34:16.840 --> 34:17.840
I go to the bathroom

34:17.840 --> 34:19.079
Excuse me for a while

34:19.079 --> 34:19.920
good

34:19.920 --> 34:21.159
Come on, come on, let me drink for her

34:21.159 --> 34:22.480
I drink for her I drink for her

34:27.480 --> 34:28.400
Chen Jiaping

34:29.079 --> 34:30.400
You did it on purpose, right?

34:31.000 --> 34:32.039
What's wrong

34:32.039 --> 34:33.760
Your girlfriend is my backer

34:34.079 --> 34:35.800
You didn't tell me either

34:37.159 --> 34:38.639
Didn’t I just know this?

34:39.400 --> 34:41.320
Mr. Nayu stamped his foot

34:41.320 --> 34:42.800
The beach in Shanghai is shaking

34:42.800 --> 34:44.679
I wish I had known she had this connection

34:44.840 --> 34:46.079
What am I doing with you?

34:47.480 --> 34:48.920
you didn't lie to me

34:49.400 --> 34:50.920
When did I lie to you?

34:53.719 --> 34:55.440
Then I have to toast you

34:56.119 --> 34:56.920
Come on

34:56.920 --> 34:57.599
Come, come, come

34:58.239 --> 34:58.880
Big brother

35:04.800 --> 35:05.880
Talk about something serious

35:06.920 --> 35:08.519
After Yamashita was poisoned

35:08.519 --> 35:09.880
Sent to Ci'an Hospital

35:10.719 --> 35:12.159
Got another shot

35:12.159 --> 35:14.719
Even one of his security guards died.

35:17.199 --> 35:18.440
I say this

35:18.760 --> 35:20.039
It's cruel enough

35:20.039 --> 35:21.199
The car is poisoned

35:21.199 --> 35:22.440
After getting out of the car, I refilled my gun.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.199
You said this was done by the military commander?

35:25.199 --> 35:26.400
It was the CCP that did it

35:26.760 --> 35:28.119
I think it's the military

35:28.639 --> 35:29.280
Why

35:29.679 --> 35:30.440
What do you think?

35:31.039 --> 35:32.599
After Yamashita was poisoned

35:33.000 --> 35:34.920
I still need to refill my gun when I get to Shanghai.

35:35.679 --> 35:37.320
That would not only cost his life

35:37.679 --> 35:38.920
I also heard

35:38.920 --> 35:40.800
They are on Yamashita Takeo

35:40.800 --> 35:42.840
Said there was a secret letter from the military commander

35:43.960 --> 35:45.519
But the strange thing is

35:45.880 --> 35:48.159
Put it in the bag at the foot of the mountain

35:48.320 --> 35:50.239
The secret letter was not found either.

35:52.800 --> 35:54.000
You need to check it carefully

36:23.280 --> 36:23.960
arrive

36:26.719 --> 36:28.159
Arrangements are here

36:29.760 --> 36:32.079
In order to express my apology to you, Zhao An

36:32.079 --> 36:33.599
I'll arrange for you to stay here tonight

36:33.599 --> 36:34.800
You guys take a good rest

36:34.800 --> 36:36.800
It won’t be too late to go to Yu’s house tomorrow

36:39.119 --> 36:40.639
Okay, I won’t bother you anymore.

36:40.960 --> 36:41.719
Hot, hot

36:41.719 --> 36:43.000
What's so hot about?

36:43.000 --> 36:44.280
Half of my life was scared to death

36:46.440 --> 36:48.440
Even if your life is gone, you still have to be warm with me.

36:48.440 --> 36:49.440
Go! Go! Go

36:50.039 --> 36:50.840
Gone

36:52.159 --> 36:53.159
Walk slowly, walk slowly

36:58.800 --> 36:59.960
This young couple

37:03.400 --> 37:05.199
do you think something is wrong

37:06.360 --> 37:07.199
No

37:07.519 --> 37:08.400
What's wrong?

37:08.679 --> 37:10.000
What a coincidence

37:11.159 --> 37:13.280
Chen Jiaping suddenly had a girlfriend

37:13.719 --> 37:15.039
All at the train station

37:15.599 --> 37:16.800
Yamashita was assassinated

37:17.360 --> 37:18.760
There are also traitors from the Chinese Communist Party

37:19.079 --> 37:20.719
It's all such a coincidence

37:21.280 --> 37:22.440
What a coincidence

37:23.159 --> 37:24.480
There must be something fishy

37:25.400 --> 37:26.039
Then I'll check it out

37:26.039 --> 37:26.760
No

37:28.559 --> 37:29.760
Zhao An will check it out

37:30.360 --> 37:32.079
Let's wait and see what happens

37:36.880 --> 37:37.880
Chief Chen, please come inside

37:38.360 --> 37:39.119
You go

37:39.119 --> 37:39.840
good

37:41.440 --> 37:41.880
let's go

37:41.880 --> 37:42.280
I close

37:42.280 --> 37:42.719
good

37:47.119 --> 37:48.800
Chen Jiaping, let me ask you

37:48.800 --> 37:50.039
why do you want to fake

38:07.599 --> 38:10.480
Why are you pretending that you still love me?

38:10.800 --> 38:11.559
Actually

38:12.079 --> 38:13.599
You've changed your mind, haven't you?

38:14.280 --> 38:16.239
I'm not pretending

38:16.239 --> 38:17.480
She's just being sentimental

38:17.480 --> 38:19.360
Don't listen to her nonsense, okay?

38:19.360 --> 38:20.440
Self-motivated

38:20.920 --> 38:22.920
I think one slap can't make a sound, right?

38:25.159 --> 38:25.760
I tell you

38:25.760 --> 38:26.960
Don't quarrel with me

38:26.960 --> 38:28.719
I've had enough trouble this day

38:28.719 --> 38:30.039
I'm still annoyed

38:30.039 --> 38:31.880
If I had known I would never come to Shanghai

38:31.880 --> 38:34.360
I thought I could buy foreign goods by taking the train

38:34.360 --> 38:35.280
The results of it

38:35.280 --> 38:36.639
Almost sat on the tiger bench

38:37.360 --> 38:38.079
alright

38:38.079 --> 38:40.000
Let's not have fun talking about it.

38:40.000 --> 38:40.920
ok

38:41.519 --> 38:42.480
I ask you

38:43.400 --> 38:44.639
Did you think of me

38:46.320 --> 38:47.400
Miss you

38:51.880 --> 38:52.519
think

38:54.079 --> 38:54.960
Especially want to

38:56.320 --> 38:58.239
Then if you want me, let's take a shower together.

38:58.239 --> 38:58.480
gone

38:58.480 --> 38:59.079
bath

39:11.400 --> 39:13.199
Why can't I hear anything clearly?

39:17.360 --> 39:18.559
The faucet is on

39:18.880 --> 39:21.239
Eavesdroppers are most afraid of the sound of water drops

39:21.239 --> 39:22.639
Isn't your kid very skilled?

39:22.639 --> 39:23.960
Think of a way

39:24.360 --> 39:26.079
What's so nice about people taking a shower?

39:26.079 --> 39:27.320
I'm not interested

39:41.800 --> 39:43.599
What a clear spring for bathing your feet

39:43.599 --> 39:45.000
Burn the harp and boil the crane

39:46.920 --> 39:47.880
Pity

39:49.920 --> 39:52.119
Can talk now

39:52.119 --> 39:53.480
But still keep your voice down

39:53.480 --> 39:54.639
so we

40:04.840 --> 40:06.480
now can you tell me

40:07.000 --> 40:07.960
why are you pretending

40:07.960 --> 40:09.440
Did you pick me up at the train station?

40:30.559 --> 40:31.840
Enjoy the meal

40:56.840 --> 40:57.800
What are you doing?

41:00.960 --> 41:01.639
stop

41:06.280 --> 41:06.960
Step aside

41:07.280 --> 41:07.960
Step aside

41:17.440 --> 41:18.079
Get out of the way

41:21.119 --> 41:21.840
screw you

41:24.519 --> 41:25.199
Get out of the way

41:58.760 --> 41:59.519
magazine

42:12.039 --> 42:12.719
Slower

42:20.199 --> 42:20.960
Bear with it

42:33.000 --> 42:34.199
why do you want to save me

42:34.639 --> 42:36.679
Then why have you been following me for the past three days?
