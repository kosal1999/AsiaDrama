01:56.280 --> 01:57.840
How dare you ask for money when the imperial army is eating?

01:58.319 --> 01:59.519
I don’t dare anymore. I don’t dare anymore.

01:59.719 --> 02:01.040
I’ll give you a long memory today

02:03.200 --> 02:03.959
stop fighting

03:14.879 --> 03:16.360
This is our goal today

03:17.360 --> 03:18.039
No

03:18.840 --> 03:20.360
Our target is Yamashita Takeo

03:20.759 --> 03:22.800
Special Mission, Military Division, Ministry of the Army, Japan

03:23.479 --> 03:24.360
As a businessman, he

03:24.360 --> 03:25.719
Stayed in China for many years

03:26.159 --> 03:27.680
Able to speak fluent Chinese

03:28.120 --> 03:29.599
But his actions have always been secretive

03:30.280 --> 03:31.639
We don't even know what he looks like

03:32.520 --> 03:33.199
This person is

03:33.280 --> 03:34.039
his guard

03:34.759 --> 03:36.000
According to reliable information

03:36.120 --> 03:37.400
He will protect Yamashita today

03:37.680 --> 03:39.439
Boarding the train from Nanjing to Shanghai

03:40.680 --> 03:41.840
I heard you started

03:42.400 --> 03:44.120
I don’t want to participate in this action

03:44.280 --> 03:45.319
In the past one or two years

03:46.039 --> 03:48.159
We haven't organized many actions to eliminate, rape and kill bandits.

03:48.479 --> 03:50.639
Making private profits by monopolizing trade in occupied areas

03:50.759 --> 03:52.840
There is even a lot of drug smuggling

03:53.680 --> 03:55.039
But this time it's different

03:55.319 --> 03:56.159
Yamashita intercepted it

03:56.560 --> 03:58.360
A confidential letter we are preparing to send to Shanghai

03:58.919 --> 04:00.080
If they let their secret service

04:00.120 --> 04:01.199
Deciphered the secret message

04:01.360 --> 04:03.240
The Shanghai Organization will surely be doomed

04:03.840 --> 04:06.280
So we must get rid of Yamashita

04:06.639 --> 04:07.840
Take back the secret message

04:08.080 --> 04:09.599
But there are so many people at the train station

04:09.919 --> 04:11.120
It’s not easy to start

04:11.120 --> 04:11.840
yes

04:12.199 --> 04:13.439
He has a characteristic

04:13.439 --> 04:14.159
left eye

04:15.199 --> 04:16.360
my judgment

04:17.120 --> 04:18.439
This person either has a strabismus

04:18.800 --> 04:20.079
Either blind

04:20.279 --> 04:21.240
prosthetic eyes

04:22.800 --> 04:24.560
The train will arrive at the station at about eight o'clock

04:24.839 --> 04:26.319
I have already investigated in advance

04:26.360 --> 04:27.480
There are two entrances over there

04:27.800 --> 04:28.800
Akun and I keep an eye on Jiakou

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
You two keep an eye on B's mouth

04:30.600 --> 04:31.560
find him

04:31.920 --> 04:32.959
we have to

04:33.160 --> 04:34.680
Before Yamashita Takeo gets on the train

04:34.800 --> 04:35.680
get rid of him

04:36.639 --> 04:38.160
There are many people at the train station and there are many exits.

04:38.399 --> 04:39.680
You have a chance to escape during the chaos

04:40.279 --> 04:40.920
good

04:41.160 --> 04:41.920
besides

04:42.439 --> 04:44.000
In case of emergency

04:44.439 --> 04:45.519
I'll take my hat off

04:45.879 --> 04:47.560
as a signal to evacuate immediately

04:59.160 --> 04:59.720
elder sister

04:59.720 --> 05:01.120
Buy a sachet

05:06.279 --> 05:07.199
how much for one

05:07.319 --> 05:08.879
Eighty cent girl

05:08.920 --> 05:10.199
This is sewn from Yun brocade

05:10.360 --> 05:11.680
Only found in Nanjing

05:12.519 --> 05:13.160
want one

05:18.040 --> 05:18.639
Keep the change, please

05:18.759 --> 05:20.000
Thank you girl, thank you sister

05:36.240 --> 05:38.120
After checking in, take the ticket and enter the station.

05:39.040 --> 05:40.639
Everyone, take your tickets in your hands

05:40.879 --> 05:41.800
Pass one by one

05:42.040 --> 05:43.639
Don't crowd, don't rush

06:01.600 --> 06:02.920
Look at the one wearing sunglasses

06:02.920 --> 06:05.319
The man next to me doesn't look like Yamashita Takeo

06:07.040 --> 06:08.920
You go over and knock his sunglasses off

06:35.360 --> 06:36.120
what do you do

06:36.319 --> 06:37.040
Don’t you have eyes?

06:37.360 --> 06:38.279
Sorry, I fell

06:41.959 --> 06:42.480
Excuse me

06:42.920 --> 06:44.120
Guawazi

06:44.759 --> 06:45.959
Forget it and go

06:53.560 --> 06:54.480
sorry

07:13.519 --> 07:14.759
That one-eyed dragon just now

07:14.759 --> 07:15.879
That's the person in the photo

07:16.279 --> 07:17.240
He took off his prosthetic eyes

07:17.240 --> 07:18.199
Wearing a black blindfold

07:18.639 --> 07:20.720
Yamashita Takeo actually sat in the second class seat

07:21.879 --> 07:23.800
Maybe I'm afraid that the first class seats will be too conspicuous.

07:23.839 --> 07:25.000
Cunning enough

07:25.120 --> 07:26.720
Have you confirmed which one is Takeo Yamashita?

07:27.639 --> 07:28.600
No

07:29.000 --> 07:30.439
But there should be more than one guard

07:30.519 --> 07:31.959
Now what

07:37.560 --> 07:38.560
Not just guards

07:39.680 --> 07:41.439
We also encountered a gendarmerie team

07:41.519 --> 07:42.720
The train station is definitely out of service.

07:43.920 --> 07:44.879
Execute backup plan

07:44.879 --> 07:46.759
Get on the train and lock down the mountain first

07:58.680 --> 07:59.600
do not move

08:04.800 --> 08:06.360
How come you have a photo of me?

08:06.639 --> 08:07.920
I picked it up

08:08.079 --> 08:09.639
Tell me from your eyes

08:10.160 --> 08:12.040
This photo is what you lost

08:13.040 --> 08:13.480
explain

08:14.360 --> 08:15.240
Who is it?

08:26.040 --> 08:27.160
Can't pass

09:33.960 --> 09:34.679
Section Chief Chen

09:34.720 --> 09:35.159
Good morning

09:35.720 --> 09:36.279
morning

09:36.679 --> 09:38.039
What about your Chronicles of the Kingdoms of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty?

09:38.200 --> 09:39.679
Nothing to do to kill time

09:39.840 --> 09:40.240
correct

09:40.600 --> 09:42.000
Manager Luo was looking for you just now

09:56.039 --> 09:56.960
Mrs. Luo

09:57.519 --> 09:59.000
What perfume are you wearing?

09:59.000 --> 09:59.639
It smells so good

10:00.519 --> 10:02.840
How can I afford any perfume?

10:04.000 --> 10:04.919
toilet water

10:05.360 --> 10:06.159
sister in law

10:06.360 --> 10:08.240
Then spray this toilet water on you

10:08.240 --> 10:10.200
Comparable to this French perfume

10:11.759 --> 10:12.960
Didn't expect that

10:13.159 --> 10:14.639
You're quite good at talking

10:15.799 --> 10:17.840
But now Lao Luo is like this

10:18.080 --> 10:19.279
After this

10:19.360 --> 10:21.840
You can only treat toilet water as perfume

10:22.399 --> 10:25.360
Used flatbread fritters as croissant cheese

10:25.639 --> 10:26.279
sister in law

10:26.759 --> 10:27.240
Fried dough sticks

10:27.240 --> 10:30.039
I would rather starve to death than eat these

10:31.840 --> 10:32.480
team leader

10:32.919 --> 10:34.360
You asked me to check the May 14th train

10:34.360 --> 10:35.159
Arrive at 3pm

10:35.480 --> 10:36.600
Do you want us to pick it up?

10:36.600 --> 10:37.279
Need not

10:37.879 --> 10:40.360
It is said that Takeo Yamashita is both mysterious and low-key.

10:40.399 --> 10:41.519
He doesn't like being picked up

10:41.600 --> 10:43.320
Then wait at the store

10:43.559 --> 10:45.320
Captain, this mountain martial artist sent it to me.

10:45.320 --> 10:47.320
Who is this CCP traitor?

10:47.440 --> 10:48.440
a big net

10:49.159 --> 10:49.679
Captain Zhao

10:49.720 --> 10:51.080
The CCP’s Big Fish and Little Fishes

10:51.240 --> 10:52.799
I can get a full bag out of the net

10:53.279 --> 10:55.320
Chief Namu Village entrusts this person to you.

10:55.399 --> 10:57.120
This makes it clear that I want you to make great achievements

10:57.279 --> 10:58.639
Then straighten you up

10:59.240 --> 11:01.519
Do I, Zhao An, need to be straightened up?

11:03.639 --> 11:06.720
Let's continue to let that Luo Guanqun be the manager.

11:06.720 --> 11:09.080
Anyway, he drinks tea and holds chopsticks.

11:09.720 --> 11:11.320
Just for decoration

11:11.440 --> 11:12.120
that is

11:12.639 --> 11:13.639
Pure decoration

11:48.120 --> 11:50.080
How about we go to the dining car at half past eleven?

11:50.360 --> 11:51.919
It's late and I'm afraid I won't have anything to eat

12:01.039 --> 12:03.120
How did you find Takeo Yamashita?

12:03.320 --> 12:04.480
Car No. 3

12:04.759 --> 12:05.840
Seat 23

12:05.919 --> 12:06.919
Wearing a gray woolen coat

12:07.360 --> 12:08.600
How did you decide

12:10.279 --> 12:11.879
I first found Qian and Cyclops

12:11.879 --> 12:12.919
Small crew cuts together

12:13.320 --> 12:15.000
He was sitting with three other people

12:15.799 --> 12:17.360
they read the same newspaper

12:17.399 --> 12:19.039
Passing cigarettes to each other and communicating from time to time

12:19.480 --> 12:21.519
So I'm sure they are traveling together

12:22.039 --> 12:23.600
And besides the gray woolen coat

12:23.639 --> 12:25.080
Where the other three people sit

12:25.080 --> 12:26.720
Line of sight can cover the entire carriage

12:27.360 --> 12:28.759
They kept looking around

12:28.759 --> 12:29.759
Very alert

12:29.840 --> 12:31.519
Monitoring the situation inside the carriage

12:31.720 --> 12:33.440
At first glance, he looks like a trained agent.

12:34.639 --> 12:35.320
also

12:35.679 --> 12:36.759
Gray woolen coat

12:36.960 --> 12:38.519
He is the only one among them who carries a bag

12:39.639 --> 12:40.799
I speculate

12:41.000 --> 12:42.159
The secret message is in the bag

12:42.480 --> 12:44.039
The gray woolen coat is Yamashita Takeo

12:45.440 --> 12:46.759
only

12:47.360 --> 12:49.360
They are now guarding Yamashita Takeo

12:49.519 --> 12:50.679
Tighter

12:52.440 --> 12:53.600
Could it be because

12:53.840 --> 12:55.360
The one-eyed dragon was killed

12:55.480 --> 12:56.960
What made them suspicious?

12:59.279 --> 13:00.200
Probably not

13:00.559 --> 13:01.799
Xiao Hu sacrifices himself

13:02.080 --> 13:03.080
He wants to let Shanxia

13:03.080 --> 13:04.759
I thought the one-eyed dragon died from robbery

13:06.039 --> 13:07.360
For Xiao Hu

13:08.559 --> 13:09.960
we must succeed

13:11.080 --> 13:12.639
What is our backup plan?

13:13.320 --> 13:14.600
poisoning

13:41.240 --> 13:42.759
According to my observation

13:43.279 --> 13:44.919
Yamashita should be left-handed

13:45.600 --> 13:46.519
he smokes

13:46.519 --> 13:47.519
flip menu

13:47.519 --> 13:48.399
take the bag

13:49.360 --> 13:50.639
They all use their left hand

13:51.279 --> 13:52.679
So when he was drinking tea

13:53.200 --> 13:54.480
I will definitely use my left hand

13:55.639 --> 13:58.120
The cups on the train have handles

13:58.639 --> 14:00.159
Left-handed person holding tea cup

14:00.320 --> 14:01.519
This should be

14:03.159 --> 14:04.799
His lips touch the rim of the cup

14:05.200 --> 14:07.320
Just the opposite of the one holding the cup in our right hand

14:07.840 --> 14:08.559
So we just need

14:08.559 --> 14:09.799
Just paint this side

14:10.200 --> 14:12.399
We need to keep an eye on these teacups in the dining car

14:12.879 --> 14:14.120
To prevent harm to innocent people

15:19.159 --> 15:20.360
you are back

15:37.960 --> 15:39.360
Aren't you afraid of your little brothers?

15:39.360 --> 15:41.279
Come back suddenly

15:42.639 --> 15:43.960
I already

15:44.879 --> 15:46.879
Send them out to drink

15:48.919 --> 15:50.559
The entire third floor

15:51.120 --> 15:52.759
Just the two of us

16:19.559 --> 16:20.360
Don't drink water

16:20.759 --> 16:22.039
what to do

16:23.960 --> 16:25.200
Don't worry

16:26.120 --> 16:27.039
Be careful

16:28.759 --> 16:29.600
Come

16:30.559 --> 16:31.600
Let's sit down and drink

16:35.720 --> 16:37.720
Soda Peanut Seeds

16:37.720 --> 16:38.639
Is there any need?

16:38.919 --> 16:39.759
Mother

16:39.759 --> 16:41.440
I want to drink soda

16:41.919 --> 16:43.039
no

16:43.039 --> 16:45.200
Every time you drink soda

16:49.000 --> 16:50.360
No thanks

16:51.120 --> 16:52.919
Soda Peanut Seeds

16:52.919 --> 16:53.919
Sit obediently

16:54.879 --> 16:57.480
Soda Peanut Seeds

17:11.920 --> 17:13.480
Do you want to drink soda?

17:15.079 --> 17:18.759
Mom won't let me drink drinks from strangers

17:20.720 --> 17:22.559
But I'm not a stranger

17:23.079 --> 17:24.519
I'm your mother's friend

17:29.880 --> 17:30.960
Do not believe

17:32.200 --> 17:33.960
I still know your little secret

17:34.240 --> 17:35.920
What little secret?

17:37.440 --> 17:38.319
that is

17:39.279 --> 17:41.480
Why doesn't your mother let you drink soda?

17:42.240 --> 17:43.880
It's because when you drink soda

17:44.480 --> 17:45.559
Will

17:51.079 --> 17:51.799
quick

17:52.400 --> 17:53.240
Take a sip

18:01.000 --> 18:01.599
Are you okay?

18:01.599 --> 18:03.279
What's wrong with that uncle?

18:05.039 --> 18:06.200
do you know

18:06.200 --> 18:07.039
Soda in mouth

18:07.039 --> 18:08.680
Will make a nice sound

18:08.680 --> 18:10.160
But you can only hear it if you close your eyes

18:10.160 --> 18:11.119
Do you want to try it?

18:11.960 --> 18:12.839
Come

18:13.960 --> 18:15.200
I'll cover your ears

18:15.200 --> 18:16.000
Listen carefully

18:16.640 --> 18:17.759
Looks like he's having a heart attack

18:18.160 --> 18:19.279
What should I do?

18:22.599 --> 18:23.440
I swear

18:23.640 --> 18:26.640
As long as one day I, Zhao An, am in charge

18:26.640 --> 18:28.319
I will definitely marry you home

18:29.000 --> 18:30.440
I also want Luo Guanqun

18:30.640 --> 18:32.200
come to our wedding

18:33.640 --> 18:35.960
I have to let him give us his blessing

18:36.759 --> 18:38.319
I just want him to know

18:38.799 --> 18:41.000
He doesn't deserve to be this manager

18:41.480 --> 18:43.880
Not worthy of being your man

18:49.799 --> 18:50.720
Does it smell good?

18:50.720 --> 18:51.880
smells good

18:52.119 --> 18:54.680
You are so fragrant every day

18:54.839 --> 18:56.720
Will Lao Luo not arouse suspicion?

18:57.559 --> 18:58.759
Lao Luo

18:58.759 --> 19:01.200
Just a shrinking old hater

19:01.759 --> 19:04.319
I just had to lie to him and say it was toilet water.

19:04.480 --> 19:05.640
He believed it

19:08.880 --> 19:09.920
toilet water

19:10.039 --> 19:10.680
He believed it

19:10.680 --> 19:11.119
Yes

19:11.400 --> 19:12.759
old hat

19:18.160 --> 19:19.359
Who is it?

19:19.680 --> 19:20.240
I

19:20.240 --> 19:21.240
Kenzo Kimura

19:25.119 --> 19:26.400
Here comes Chief Kimura.

19:27.200 --> 19:27.759
curtains curtains

19:28.799 --> 19:29.359
Hurry up

19:30.480 --> 19:31.960
Here comes Chief Kimura.

19:32.240 --> 19:33.480
Coming, coming, coming

19:33.480 --> 19:34.599
Director Kimura

19:42.119 --> 19:43.119
I've gone to see it

19:43.160 --> 19:44.720
It seems that Yamashita is not dead yet

19:46.240 --> 19:47.799
It looks like poison smeared on the rim of the cup

19:47.799 --> 19:48.799
Not enough dosage

19:49.079 --> 19:50.079
It doesn't matter

19:50.279 --> 19:51.839
If there is still breath left at the foot of the mountain

19:51.880 --> 19:53.119
After arriving in Shanghai

19:53.279 --> 19:54.880
Will definitely be sent to the station infirmary first

19:54.880 --> 19:55.839
emergency treatment

19:56.359 --> 19:57.480
Let's take advantage of the opportunity

19:57.559 --> 19:58.400
Get the secret message

19:59.599 --> 20:01.160
Missing the welcome from afar

20:15.039 --> 20:16.160
Captain Zhao

20:17.039 --> 20:18.200
What are you doing

20:19.279 --> 20:20.839
Nothing done

20:23.640 --> 20:25.359
why don't you answer the phone

20:26.000 --> 20:27.440
I just went out

20:27.640 --> 20:28.799
Didn't receive it

20:28.799 --> 20:30.359
I'm sorry, Chief Kimura.

20:30.960 --> 20:33.160
Why do you have to close the curtains in broad daylight?

20:35.279 --> 20:36.720
The sun is big

20:36.960 --> 20:38.519
Director Kimura

20:44.960 --> 20:46.480
So that's it

20:46.799 --> 20:49.799
No wonder you have to answer my call

20:50.480 --> 20:52.119
Chinese people often say

20:52.519 --> 20:53.160
rabbit

20:53.160 --> 20:54.359
Don't eat the grass on the edge of the nest

20:54.480 --> 20:55.359
Didn't eat

20:57.720 --> 20:58.839
go out

21:04.319 --> 21:06.079
You have grass

21:06.680 --> 21:08.000
Why run all over the mountain?

21:08.440 --> 21:09.319
Don't dare

21:09.640 --> 21:10.400
Don't dare to run

21:10.920 --> 21:12.359
Just received an emergency telegram

21:12.599 --> 21:14.519
Colonel Yamashita had an accident

21:14.880 --> 21:15.839
As soon as the train arrives

21:16.160 --> 21:17.960
We need to take him to our infirmary

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
emergency treatment

21:19.079 --> 21:19.720
yes

21:20.119 --> 21:22.960
You lead people to set up controls around the infirmary.

21:24.599 --> 21:26.160
Another problem this time

21:27.599 --> 21:29.000
watch your head

21:29.000 --> 21:29.839
clear

21:34.359 --> 21:36.799
Do you know there is a mole in your firm?

21:37.960 --> 21:38.920
Insider

21:39.880 --> 21:41.039
Wait until you know

21:41.039 --> 21:42.640
You have turned into a ghost

21:43.319 --> 21:45.559
If you find a suspicious person, arrest him immediately

21:45.680 --> 21:46.599
yes

22:59.960 --> 23:01.839
No one is allowed to get off the car first

23:02.440 --> 23:03.200
What's going on?

23:04.039 --> 23:04.799
Not allowed to get off the bus

23:05.359 --> 23:06.119
Go forward

23:11.839 --> 23:12.599
Get out of the way Get out of the way

23:12.599 --> 23:13.599
get out of the way get out of the way

23:13.599 --> 23:14.279
excuse me

23:14.720 --> 23:15.519
Get out of the way

23:15.519 --> 23:16.279
Step aside

23:19.880 --> 23:20.640
Optimistic

23:21.720 --> 23:22.480
Get out of the way

23:27.359 --> 23:28.519
If you don't take action, you won't have a chance.

23:30.519 --> 23:32.039
If we can’t do it now, we’ll find a chance to talk about it.

23:32.200 --> 23:33.079
That's too late

23:36.480 --> 23:38.480
You can get off the second-class carriage now.

23:42.480 --> 23:43.559
Don't squeeze, don't squeeze

23:47.559 --> 23:49.359
Isn't that cold dew?

23:50.079 --> 23:50.799
Who is Hanlu?

23:50.920 --> 23:51.799
Big star

23:52.359 --> 23:53.720
She looks so beautiful

23:54.440 --> 23:55.640
It's a pity

23:55.720 --> 23:57.400
Filmed for a Japanese film studio

23:57.720 --> 23:58.519
A traitor

23:58.519 --> 23:59.279
get out of the way get out of the way

23:59.279 --> 23:59.799
Step aside

23:59.799 --> 24:00.319
Get out of the way

24:00.319 --> 24:01.119
stand up

24:06.480 --> 24:07.160
Miss Hanlu

24:07.160 --> 24:08.640
I am your movie fan. Please sign it for me.

24:35.200 --> 24:35.599
stand up

24:35.599 --> 24:36.400
I beat you to death

24:36.400 --> 24:37.200
Dog traitor

24:37.720 --> 24:38.319
let me go

24:38.480 --> 24:38.880
Go quickly

24:43.599 --> 24:44.880
Come on, it's dangerous here

24:45.240 --> 24:45.839
etc.

24:46.400 --> 24:47.000
thank you for saving me

24:47.400 --> 24:48.319
I'm not a traitor

24:49.079 --> 24:49.440
good

24:49.880 --> 24:50.960
Miss Hanlu, let’s go quickly

25:02.799 --> 25:03.599
Go quickly

25:10.400 --> 25:11.440
Daxuan

25:23.519 --> 25:24.160
stop

25:30.000 --> 25:30.880
Chase quickly

25:31.039 --> 25:31.920
Chase fast

25:32.680 --> 25:34.079
He ran over there. Chase him quickly.

25:34.079 --> 25:34.599
quick

25:42.119 --> 25:42.640
stop

25:44.720 --> 25:45.400
two knives

25:45.559 --> 25:47.240
Look at the woman in the hat and trench coat

25:47.480 --> 25:48.839
He should be on the same team as the assassin.

25:49.079 --> 25:49.880
Chase

26:08.240 --> 26:08.759
quick

26:41.880 --> 26:42.880
Chen Jiaping

26:45.599 --> 26:46.279
Captain Zhao

26:46.799 --> 26:48.000
Are all the brothers here?

26:50.079 --> 26:50.839
On a mission?

26:50.839 --> 26:51.519
Captain Zhao

26:51.680 --> 26:52.920
what are you doing here

26:56.680 --> 26:58.160
Picking up my girlfriend

26:59.319 --> 26:59.799
you say

27:00.039 --> 27:01.000
Guoguo, you too

27:02.359 --> 27:02.960
I said it all

27:02.960 --> 27:04.000
Waiting for you at the exit

27:04.240 --> 27:05.480
Why haven't you come out for a long time?

27:05.839 --> 27:06.319
I don't know the way

27:06.319 --> 27:07.079
You don't know

27:07.079 --> 27:08.400
I've been looking for it for a long time

27:09.559 --> 27:10.680
I also encountered someone shooting

27:10.680 --> 27:11.920
Scared to death

27:12.200 --> 27:13.200
Where are you waiting for me

27:17.400 --> 27:19.119
I was waiting for you at the exit from the beginning

27:19.119 --> 27:20.359
I heard gunshots inside

27:20.359 --> 27:21.440
I'll run in quickly

27:21.440 --> 27:22.480
I worry about you

27:22.599 --> 27:23.359
Isn't this just

27:23.799 --> 27:25.160
Didn’t we just meet each other?

27:26.640 --> 27:27.960
do not be angry

27:29.240 --> 27:29.920
Captain Zhao

27:30.119 --> 27:31.000
Funny

27:31.519 --> 27:32.920
Why don't you get busy first?

27:32.920 --> 27:34.799
I'll take my girlfriend and leave first.

27:38.720 --> 27:39.799
be safe

27:42.480 --> 27:43.119
Let's go

27:43.799 --> 27:44.160
Walk

27:45.839 --> 27:46.720
what's up

27:47.440 --> 27:48.759
They two know each other

27:49.519 --> 27:50.039
elder brother

27:50.279 --> 27:51.200
Do you want to arrest them?

29:17.599 --> 29:18.079
Sit down

29:20.799 --> 29:21.480
Thanks

29:23.640 --> 29:24.880
Get to the car tomorrow

29:24.880 --> 29:26.839
First identify the person to contact you

29:27.599 --> 29:29.240
He will be in the same carriage with you

29:29.240 --> 29:30.279
wearing gray hat

29:30.920 --> 29:32.119
After getting the newspaper

29:32.119 --> 29:33.720
Get off at Zhenjiang Station

29:33.960 --> 29:35.160
Then return to Nanjing

29:35.480 --> 29:36.160
I see

29:37.200 --> 29:39.000
Tomorrow is your first mission

29:39.480 --> 29:40.319
Are you confident?

29:42.039 --> 29:42.519
have

29:43.519 --> 29:44.640
I heard

29:44.839 --> 29:47.400
You have to go to Zuo Shuangtao to get a marriage license tomorrow.

29:48.839 --> 29:49.359
right

29:50.039 --> 29:51.559
But I plan to tell Guoguo

29:52.039 --> 29:53.359
Let’s get the certificate another day.

29:54.960 --> 29:55.960
this is not good

29:56.519 --> 29:58.400
If you change the time temporarily

29:58.799 --> 30:00.680
It will make Zuo Shuangtao suspicious

30:01.200 --> 30:03.200
If you can successfully complete the task tomorrow

30:03.400 --> 30:04.680
Return to Nanjing on time

30:04.960 --> 30:05.960
You can go get the certificate

30:06.440 --> 30:07.000
yes

30:07.480 --> 30:08.559
Please rest assured the organization

30:08.839 --> 30:09.640
Mission first

30:11.160 --> 30:12.359
Zuo Shuangtao

30:12.839 --> 30:14.039
She didn't doubt you, did she?

30:15.119 --> 30:15.680
No

30:18.359 --> 30:19.319
Jiaping

30:20.319 --> 30:23.480
Although the organization approved your marriage application

30:24.039 --> 30:26.559
But Zuo Shuangtao is not a member of our party after all.

30:26.799 --> 30:28.119
She is just an ordinary person

30:28.880 --> 30:29.960
At any time

30:30.400 --> 30:31.759
Can't reveal it to her

30:31.759 --> 30:33.079
the secret of your identity

31:07.480 --> 31:08.960
The murderer should have known about it in advance

31:08.960 --> 31:10.440
The gray top hat has information

31:10.640 --> 31:12.519
He must have taken the newspaper away

31:13.440 --> 31:15.200
But who will be the murderer?

31:15.480 --> 31:16.200
the only clue

31:16.200 --> 31:18.559
It's the newspaper the murderer is holding.

31:24.519 --> 31:26.119
We will arrive at Zhenjiang Station in a while

31:26.200 --> 31:28.039
The murderer will most likely get off at this stop

31:28.720 --> 31:30.759
The murderer must be found before this happens

31:30.880 --> 31:31.680
But keep looking like this

31:32.119 --> 31:33.240
No clue at all

31:33.920 --> 31:36.240
He has a newspaper in his pocket

31:36.559 --> 31:38.200
There will be a secret writing potion on it.

31:38.240 --> 31:39.359
Mark intelligence content

31:40.400 --> 31:41.559
Secret Writing Potion

31:42.359 --> 31:43.759
Use secret writing potion on newspaper

31:43.759 --> 31:45.279
Mark information content

31:45.359 --> 31:46.720
It takes time

31:47.400 --> 31:49.000
It couldn't have been done this morning.

31:49.279 --> 31:50.319
But yesterday

31:50.319 --> 31:52.119
It was completed even earlier

31:53.119 --> 31:53.599
so

31:54.279 --> 31:55.519
Newspaper held by gray top hat

31:55.680 --> 31:56.799
Not today

31:57.039 --> 31:58.000
Just take yesterday

31:58.000 --> 31:59.720
Or someone from an earlier newspaper

31:59.720 --> 32:00.799
that person

32:00.799 --> 32:01.720
It's the murderer

32:14.119 --> 32:16.599
The murderer must have hidden the newspaper

32:16.680 --> 32:17.440
what to do

32:18.079 --> 32:20.319
Is the first mission about to fail?

32:20.559 --> 32:22.960
No, absolutely not

32:25.279 --> 32:27.440
Judging from the posture of the gray top hat falling to the ground

32:27.799 --> 32:29.920
He should have been facing the mirror when he was killed

32:30.400 --> 32:32.599
The murderer stuck a needle into his neck

32:32.920 --> 32:35.039
It has to be done at close range

32:35.839 --> 32:36.759
He must have seen it

32:36.759 --> 32:38.480
The murderer approaching him behind him

32:39.640 --> 32:41.599
But as an intelligence worker

32:41.599 --> 32:43.359
There is a certain degree of vigilance

32:44.200 --> 32:47.119
But there was no sign of struggle or resistance at all.

32:47.440 --> 32:48.920
Why are you so negligent?

32:48.920 --> 32:51.240
Let the murderer get close to him easily

32:52.200 --> 32:54.079
Unless the identity of the murderer

32:54.279 --> 32:56.000
Make him relax his vigilance

32:56.480 --> 32:57.759
That must be the murderer

32:57.759 --> 32:59.119
The train has arrived

32:59.319 --> 33:01.240
Passengers please get off the bus in an orderly manner

33:01.960 --> 33:03.839
Take your belongings with you

33:04.359 --> 33:05.359
Don't leave anything behind

33:06.079 --> 33:07.640
If you have children, please hold them accountable

33:09.000 --> 33:10.640
Don't squeeze, don't squeeze

33:38.279 --> 33:39.000
What's wrong

33:39.559 --> 33:40.559
Biased a bit

33:40.559 --> 33:41.240
Are you okay?

33:43.599 --> 33:44.359
fine

33:58.319 --> 33:59.400
Quite a big change

34:01.759 --> 34:02.680
Mature, right?

34:06.559 --> 34:07.079
Come

34:08.159 --> 34:08.880
Slow down, slow down

34:12.400 --> 34:13.320
Where did it come from?

34:14.679 --> 34:15.239
Wuhan

34:17.880 --> 34:19.639
You later went to Wuhan

34:21.159 --> 34:22.679
Can you leave me and come to Shanghai?

34:22.960 --> 34:24.199
I can't go to Wuhan

34:34.719 --> 34:35.280
do not move

34:35.840 --> 34:36.800
thank you for helping me

34:37.079 --> 34:38.360
Let's walk a little further

34:38.960 --> 34:40.519
If no one follows

34:41.599 --> 34:42.599
we

34:44.880 --> 34:47.239
Just go their separate ways

35:06.880 --> 35:07.800
who are they

35:09.440 --> 35:10.760
What are you doing in Shanghai?

35:12.199 --> 35:13.159
none of your business

35:15.199 --> 35:16.280
Still angry with me

35:17.679 --> 35:18.719
Thinking too much

35:19.519 --> 35:21.559
It depends on your position in my heart.

35:23.400 --> 35:24.280
I know

35:24.760 --> 35:26.400
I missed my appointment on the day I received my certificate.

35:27.280 --> 35:29.320
did something that made you sad

35:31.000 --> 35:32.280
you won't forgive me

35:33.199 --> 35:33.960
sorry

35:35.239 --> 35:36.159
Is there a mirror?

35:36.760 --> 35:37.519
What for?

35:38.119 --> 35:39.039
Touch up your makeup

35:47.880 --> 35:48.480
no one

35:50.880 --> 35:52.639
We'll separate when we reach the intersection ahead.

35:55.360 --> 35:57.039
I still have important things to do

35:59.280 --> 35:59.960
What a coincidence

36:00.599 --> 36:01.920
I also have important things to do

36:46.159 --> 36:46.480
alright

36:46.480 --> 36:48.119
Don't be angry, okay?

36:48.320 --> 36:48.639
Section Chief Chen

36:48.639 --> 36:49.280
do not be angry

36:50.119 --> 36:51.159
Very sweet

36:51.599 --> 36:52.920
Captain Zhao meets again

36:54.880 --> 36:56.199
Where are you going?

36:56.800 --> 36:57.519
Go shopping

36:58.199 --> 36:59.679
Just now I saw a left

36:59.679 --> 37:00.559
one to the right

37:00.760 --> 37:01.760
Parted ways

37:02.199 --> 37:02.760
look

37:03.280 --> 37:05.159
Make people laugh on the first day here

37:06.000 --> 37:06.599
That's it

37:06.800 --> 37:08.280
I originally told you about the train station.

37:08.280 --> 37:09.639
Take her here by the Huangpu River

37:09.639 --> 37:10.559
stroll around

37:10.760 --> 37:11.480
She does not

37:11.599 --> 37:12.599
Must go shopping

37:12.639 --> 37:13.480
Don’t look at the scenery

37:13.719 --> 37:15.000
Isn’t this a disagreement?

37:15.440 --> 37:16.719
There was a bit of a conflict

37:18.320 --> 37:19.760
You just don’t want to spend money

37:20.039 --> 37:21.679
Who wants to see the Huangpu River?

37:22.000 --> 37:23.639
When you arrive in Shanghai, you definitely need to do some shopping.

37:23.639 --> 37:24.800
Yes, yes, I was wrong

37:25.039 --> 37:27.320
Which shopping mall does Ms. Zuo want to go to?

37:27.360 --> 37:28.239
Wing On Shopping Center

37:28.239 --> 37:29.199
I'll send it to you

37:29.199 --> 37:29.760
No

37:30.159 --> 37:31.000
Let's go shopping by ourselves

37:31.000 --> 37:31.840
Get in the car

37:32.360 --> 37:34.000
I'm afraid you won't be able to go to the mall.

37:34.920 --> 37:35.559
Why

37:35.960 --> 37:38.039
I suspect you are involved in the assassination

37:38.559 --> 37:40.199
Come back with us and cooperate with the investigation

37:40.960 --> 37:42.400
baffling

37:42.639 --> 37:44.000
Why are you investigating me?

37:44.199 --> 37:44.880
Not Captain Zhao

37:45.559 --> 37:47.320
It must be a misunderstanding

37:47.320 --> 37:49.400
My girlfriend came to Shanghai to visit me

37:49.400 --> 37:50.800
How could it be related to the murder?

37:50.800 --> 37:51.559
Feng Qi

37:52.199 --> 37:53.639
Take Chen Jiaping back too

37:53.800 --> 37:54.199
yes

37:54.639 --> 37:55.320
Not later

37:56.320 --> 37:56.760
for

37:57.199 --> 37:58.360
Why take me back

37:58.360 --> 37:59.320
you have no mission

37:59.639 --> 38:01.039
But showed up at the train station

38:01.320 --> 38:02.320
Very suspicious

38:03.039 --> 38:03.920
I said Captain Zhao

38:04.480 --> 38:05.679
This is why you are wrong, right?

38:06.119 --> 38:07.840
Let's work together at least

38:08.360 --> 38:09.320
you want to take me back

38:09.320 --> 38:10.880
No matter what, you have to have evidence, right?

38:10.880 --> 38:11.519
evidence

38:11.960 --> 38:13.119
Go back for a first trial

38:13.440 --> 38:14.559
There is evidence

38:15.119 --> 38:16.000
two knives

38:16.239 --> 38:17.000
Feng Qi

38:17.000 --> 38:18.280
You two will be escorted separately

38:18.480 --> 38:19.440
To prevent collusion

38:20.039 --> 38:20.519
yes

38:21.079 --> 38:22.239
Chen Jiaping

38:22.599 --> 38:23.719
Isn't this a trading company?

38:23.719 --> 38:25.159
Why are you arresting people so casually?

38:25.719 --> 38:26.400
it's okay no problem

38:26.400 --> 38:27.639
Just go back and chat

38:29.519 --> 38:29.920
Walk

38:31.119 --> 38:32.320
Section Chief Chen, please

38:34.559 --> 38:35.440
This way, this way

38:35.760 --> 38:36.400
Section Chief Chen's side

38:52.280 --> 38:53.199
Miss Zuo

38:53.559 --> 38:55.039
Where are your windbreaker and hat?

38:55.719 --> 38:57.199
What windbreaker hat?

38:58.440 --> 38:59.920
When I got on the bus from Wuhan

38:59.920 --> 39:01.159
This is what I'm wearing

39:01.760 --> 39:03.280
It’s already over 20 degrees in Wuhan

39:03.280 --> 39:05.239
No need for a windbreaker or a hat

39:06.440 --> 39:08.880
Why were you at the assassination scene?

39:09.440 --> 39:11.079
I'm looking for Chen Jiaping

39:11.920 --> 39:13.000
how would i know

39:13.119 --> 39:14.760
Will you encounter a murderer at the train station?

39:14.760 --> 39:16.000
Scared to death

39:16.159 --> 39:17.960
You said you were looking for Chen Jiaping

39:18.599 --> 39:19.920
What are you doing with him?

39:20.719 --> 39:22.039
I'm his girlfriend

39:23.119 --> 39:24.519
Why do you think I came to him?

39:25.880 --> 39:27.880
Didn't I tell you what you are going to do?

39:29.320 --> 39:31.280
Let's have a fight with colleagues at least

39:33.360 --> 39:34.400
speak

39:34.400 --> 39:36.360
Just be quiet, Chief Chen

39:37.800 --> 39:39.079
What are you doing?

39:40.840 --> 39:41.960
Who is Jia Ping?

39:42.159 --> 39:43.079
own people

39:43.079 --> 39:44.199
Look what you've done

39:44.519 --> 39:45.679
Go, go, go

39:49.079 --> 39:50.280
Full of food

39:51.280 --> 39:52.320
I am busy

39:52.599 --> 39:54.159
Wouldn't it be over if you just explain it?

39:54.400 --> 39:55.599
Zhao An didn't do anything to you, right?

39:55.599 --> 39:56.360
No

39:56.760 --> 39:57.639
your face

39:57.639 --> 39:58.679
He still has to give it

39:59.119 --> 39:59.639
Let's go

40:00.159 --> 40:00.760
Not in a hurry, not in a hurry

40:00.760 --> 40:01.800
Come, come, sit down

40:02.280 --> 40:03.159
sit sit sit sit

40:05.719 --> 40:06.400
large spoon

41:27.559 --> 41:28.840
why are you so close to me

41:29.199 --> 41:30.159
Separately

41:30.719 --> 41:31.159
I

41:31.880 --> 41:33.079
I saw someone trying to kill you

41:33.079 --> 41:34.239
i want to remind you

41:34.239 --> 41:35.079
But I haven’t waited to speak yet

41:35.079 --> 41:35.880
He shot

41:35.880 --> 41:36.800
hit me

41:37.159 --> 41:38.239
Don't be afraid of me

41:43.159 --> 41:44.159
thank you

41:50.199 --> 41:51.400
i saved you

41:52.239 --> 41:53.559
You don't care about me

41:56.519 --> 41:57.639
May I have your name

41:58.320 --> 41:59.519
what's your name

42:08.000 --> 42:09.559
May I have your name

42:11.079 --> 42:11.880
Chen Jiaping

42:14.719 --> 42:15.599
My surname is Luo

42:15.920 --> 42:17.000
His name is Luo Guanqun

42:20.000 --> 42:20.639
Jiaping

42:21.679 --> 42:22.920
What are you thinking about?

42:24.039 --> 42:25.719
I wonder how we met?

42:25.880 --> 42:27.440
I took a shot for you

42:27.960 --> 42:28.840
Otherwise you are now

42:28.840 --> 42:30.679
Any chance you can interrogate me here?

42:31.599 --> 42:32.480
Good for you

42:32.719 --> 42:33.840
Seriously

42:35.360 --> 42:36.239
someone said

42:36.239 --> 42:38.280
There is an undercover agent of the CCP in our trading company

42:39.000 --> 42:41.280
Be informed of our organization’s actions in advance

42:41.440 --> 42:43.239
Zhao An was in action at the train station today

42:43.800 --> 42:45.239
I can't help it

42:45.400 --> 42:46.239
Go through the motions

42:46.239 --> 42:47.440
Dealing with the Japanese

42:48.679 --> 42:49.400
Say it again

42:49.800 --> 42:51.119
You can't go anywhere

42:51.519 --> 42:53.519
why are you going to the train station

42:56.480 --> 42:57.360
Stop asking

42:57.719 --> 42:58.239
What

43:00.039 --> 43:01.519
Picked up my girlfriend

43:03.239 --> 43:05.519
When did you have a girlfriend?

43:05.920 --> 43:07.039
Never told me

43:07.039 --> 43:08.320
Keep your voice down

43:08.519 --> 43:09.920
Affect my market situation

43:10.119 --> 43:10.559
you

43:13.000 --> 43:13.480
I

43:13.800 --> 43:14.639
Me and my girlfriend

43:14.639 --> 43:16.679
The two of us have been living apart in two places

43:17.119 --> 43:18.960
I don't even have a chance to introduce you to them.

43:19.639 --> 43:20.519
Moreover

43:21.159 --> 43:24.000
Ever since I worked under your hand

43:24.440 --> 43:26.920
I experienced the feasting and feasting of Shanghai with you

43:27.320 --> 43:28.039
A man

43:29.039 --> 43:31.119
This can never make life

43:31.119 --> 43:32.880
Missing some possibilities

43:35.280 --> 43:35.840
OK

43:36.480 --> 43:37.159
understand

43:38.800 --> 43:40.559
Which bus did your girlfriend take?

43:40.559 --> 43:41.719
What time did you arrive?
