01:33.319 --> 01:34.519
Because you are my brother.

01:34.599 --> 01:35.879
Xiao Douzi knocked you out

01:36.040 --> 01:37.359
of course he should apologize to you.

01:37.719 --> 01:39.319
However, you also feel uncomfortable riding it again.

01:39.319 --> 01:40.640
You should apologize to him too.

01:40.920 --> 01:42.719
This problem started with me.

01:42.719 --> 01:43.879
I also keep Xiao Douzi.

01:43.879 --> 01:45.719
So I also have to apologize to both of you

01:47.120 --> 01:48.159
you're not normal

01:49.200 --> 01:50.599
if it's still not normal

01:51.079 --> 01:52.239
I'll chase him away for you.

01:52.239 --> 01:53.239
I won't take you

01:53.519 --> 01:54.280
believe it or not?

01:56.040 --> 01:56.480
Sis.

01:56.480 --> 01:57.359
Sister-in-law.

01:58.760 --> 01:59.519
Charm.

02:07.640 --> 02:08.840
Why is it here?

02:09.639 --> 02:10.599
I understand.

02:11.080 --> 02:11.840
Sis,

02:11.840 --> 02:14.000
You and Mrs. Luo want to continue their relationship again.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.120
Mei Kai dua kali

02:17.120 --> 02:17.879
humble.

02:18.719 --> 02:20.879
This time can't let Guan Qun know anymore.

02:20.879 --> 02:21.840
Truly.

02:22.879 --> 02:24.560
Indeed, we met the forest after a long dry season.

02:24.560 --> 02:26.080
Otherwise, why did her earring break too?

02:26.080 --> 02:27.560
You go. Go.

02:27.560 --> 02:28.520
You just go busy.

02:28.520 --> 02:29.719
Sister.

02:30.159 --> 02:32.120
Quickly return your earrings.

02:32.439 --> 02:34.919
So as not to be discovered by Luo Guanqun again.

02:53.479 --> 02:54.759
First of all I want to know

02:55.240 --> 02:58.000
your specific action plan is still a plan

03:02.840 --> 03:04.759
we will move with the storm team

03:05.159 --> 03:06.479
save the kidnapped members first

03:06.479 --> 03:07.439
and also the workers

03:08.000 --> 03:09.439
then set the bomb

03:09.439 --> 03:11.000
destroy the counterfeit money factory.

03:13.639 --> 03:14.400
What is it?

03:15.280 --> 03:16.599
Our plan is problematic.

03:18.159 --> 03:19.159
I've asked.

03:19.520 --> 03:22.400
This factory continues production 24 hours,

03:22.639 --> 03:23.840
at the same time, it still exists

03:23.840 --> 03:26.159
teams of Japanese soldiers stood guard day and night.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.159
Want to enter from the main door

03:28.599 --> 03:29.680
that's very difficult.

03:30.319 --> 03:32.360
So, you underestimated Team Storm's combat power.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.120
Enough to face some unprepared Japanese troops.

03:35.120 --> 03:35.840
Still many.

03:36.199 --> 03:37.199
But don't forget,

03:37.439 --> 03:39.120
Shanghai-Xi section of the Military Police Headquarters

03:39.120 --> 03:40.400
is 15 minutes from this factory

03:40.400 --> 03:42.120
from this factory.

03:42.120 --> 03:43.240
Once the battle begins,

03:43.680 --> 03:45.159
their help will be very fast.

03:47.240 --> 03:48.360
If so, what is your suggestion?

03:49.159 --> 03:50.120
There is only one way

03:50.800 --> 03:51.719
say it.

03:52.479 --> 03:53.719
Every 8 p.m

03:53.719 --> 03:54.960
office workers in this factory

03:54.960 --> 03:55.919
and also night shift workers.

03:55.919 --> 03:57.479
Will change shifts.

03:57.479 --> 03:58.520
Apart from the workers

03:58.960 --> 04:00.159
Japanese troops

04:00.159 --> 04:02.240
will be guarded by two soldiers,

04:02.560 --> 04:04.280
others will also change shifts.

04:05.080 --> 04:06.639
So in this time

04:07.080 --> 04:09.919
in the entire factory there were only two foremen

04:10.240 --> 04:11.479
there are still 2 Japanese soldiers

04:11.759 --> 04:13.240
is when the defense is very weak.

04:13.599 --> 04:14.319
Correct.

04:15.199 --> 04:17.680
But this shift change won't take too long.

04:18.160 --> 04:19.279
20 minutes at most.

04:19.839 --> 04:20.639
Twenty minutes.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.720
In that case, we simply don't have time to deploy

04:24.720 --> 04:25.920
and perform operations.

04:27.240 --> 04:28.839
However, if within these 20 minutes

04:28.839 --> 04:30.480
can reach the target,

04:30.839 --> 04:33.000
I think we still have a chance of success.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.279
You mean the right target?

04:35.560 --> 04:36.800
Before the operation begins

04:37.279 --> 04:39.040
we go into the factory,

04:39.319 --> 04:41.439
Look for the location of the money printing factory.

04:41.720 --> 04:44.000
Then, ask the Storm Team to get straight to the point.

04:44.480 --> 04:45.959
Before help arrives,

04:46.439 --> 04:47.519
we completed the mission.

04:48.439 --> 04:49.519
This factory

04:49.519 --> 04:52.319
continuously producing for 24 hours

04:52.639 --> 04:54.480
Apart from that, there is a team of Japanese soldiers

04:55.000 --> 04:55.920
how do we get in

04:56.399 --> 04:57.279
So,

04:58.319 --> 05:00.160
You know I'm the one who takes care of general affairs,

05:00.600 --> 05:01.839
Let's just say your luck is good.

05:03.519 --> 05:04.680
I've asked.

05:04.680 --> 05:07.079
Lunch and dinner at this factory.

05:07.079 --> 05:08.160
By a restaurant in town

05:08.160 --> 05:10.319
the so-called restaurant opening restaurant.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.439
Wait until the dining cart arrives at the factory

05:12.439 --> 05:14.560
the foreman will check all workers' certificates

05:15.040 --> 05:16.800
then a restaurant worker

05:16.800 --> 05:18.360
bringing food into the factory,

05:18.639 --> 05:19.680
one by one.

05:20.720 --> 05:21.800
What you mean is

05:22.120 --> 05:24.279
we can disguise ourselves as restaurant employees.

05:24.279 --> 05:24.920
Correct

05:25.319 --> 05:27.199
the scale of this restaurant is large

05:27.199 --> 05:28.160
there are lots of people

05:28.439 --> 05:29.560
its mobility is frequently used.

05:29.839 --> 05:32.240
The foreman cannot possibly know everyone's face.

05:32.519 --> 05:34.160
As long as we make witnesses as one,...

05:35.160 --> 05:36.399
Then the foreman will no longer be suspicious.

05:36.720 --> 05:38.600
But even if we enter the factory,

05:39.079 --> 05:40.480
how can you find a counterfeit money factory?

05:40.800 --> 05:42.800
I'm considering it too.

05:43.399 --> 05:45.360
We now have absolutely no clue.

05:47.519 --> 05:48.240
Guoguo,

05:48.800 --> 05:49.680
try to think about it.

05:50.040 --> 05:52.600
The Japanese locked up workers and experts.

05:53.279 --> 05:55.680
But it must ensure their basic survival every day

05:55.680 --> 05:56.199
right, right?

05:57.079 --> 05:57.680
Good.

05:58.319 --> 06:00.920
The counterfeit money factory numbers 30 to 40 people.

06:00.920 --> 06:02.439
Plus Japanese troops

06:02.720 --> 06:04.839
how to prepare their food?

06:07.439 --> 06:08.920
I remember Guo Yun once said,

06:08.920 --> 06:10.959
they can eat buns every afternoon.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.160
My wife's memory is the best.

06:14.240 --> 06:15.040
Correct.

06:15.399 --> 06:17.199
Lunch, eat two packs of vegetables,

06:17.639 --> 06:19.560
the night of porridge and flower rolls.

06:20.120 --> 06:21.079
Once every week

06:21.079 --> 06:22.839
= Gemice = You can eat meat buns once at night

06:24.079 --> 06:26.000
This is the opening restaurant menu.

06:27.480 --> 06:28.600
I understand.

06:29.759 --> 06:32.279
The food they send to the military clothing factory,

06:32.279 --> 06:33.600
actually there are some,

06:33.600 --> 06:35.199
sent to an underground counterfeit money factory

06:35.199 --> 06:35.839
Correct.

06:36.120 --> 06:37.199
There must be someone

06:37.199 --> 06:39.560
send some of the food to a counterfeit money factory.

06:39.959 --> 06:41.480
As long as we follow this guy,

06:41.839 --> 06:43.879
we can find out the location of this counterfeit money factory.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.560
This is a great way.

07:04.959 --> 07:05.759
Go down.

07:13.240 --> 07:14.160
Give me the ring.

07:17.279 --> 07:17.839
Remember that.

07:18.120 --> 07:19.199
Do not speak.

07:19.839 --> 07:21.399
After this operation is complete,

07:21.399 --> 07:22.240
commander of the Military Police Soldiers

07:22.240 --> 07:24.199
will definitely do research on all of us.

07:24.519 --> 07:25.839
Including everyone in the factory.

07:25.839 --> 07:26.839
Will check one by one.

07:26.839 --> 07:28.480
We are some people disguised as delivery people

07:28.759 --> 07:30.160
the picture will definitely be painted.

07:30.759 --> 07:31.759
Especially the two of us,

07:32.279 --> 07:33.800
frequent contact with Japanese people.

07:33.800 --> 07:35.360
So you have to pretend well

07:38.319 --> 07:40.439
I saw today they eat meatloaf.

07:41.040 --> 07:43.000
These two big buckets were supposed to be for workers

07:43.000 --> 07:44.240
the two below,

07:44.240 --> 07:45.680
should have been sent to a counterfeit money factory.

07:45.879 --> 07:47.079
Your analysis is not wrong.

07:48.240 --> 07:49.240
In this basket,

07:49.240 --> 07:51.199
supposedly for Japanese soldiers and foremen.

07:53.680 --> 07:55.000
How do we divide the tasks later?

07:55.399 --> 07:57.759
You guys distribute buns to the workers outside.

07:58.560 --> 08:00.839
I went to serve the Japanese and the foreman.

08:01.480 --> 08:02.480
I'm coming with you.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.319
Don't believe me.

08:08.399 --> 08:09.040
Good.

08:09.160 --> 08:09.800
No problem.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.439
Guoguo, help me look for a moment.

08:35.159 --> 08:36.720
Why is it so late today?

08:36.720 --> 08:37.759
Why have you just arrived?

08:38.039 --> 08:39.240
Far

08:42.759 --> 08:44.480
Why is everyone foreign today?

08:44.480 --> 08:45.200
Change people again.

08:45.200 --> 08:46.200
You go ask the boss.

08:47.320 --> 08:49.000
I see your emotions are not small.

08:49.679 --> 08:50.960
Of course.

08:51.320 --> 08:53.080
Sending 50 minutes to you

08:53.360 --> 08:55.159
delivery to the city only a dozen minutes,

08:55.440 --> 08:56.399
give me the same salary.

08:56.399 --> 08:57.960
If you don't have emotions,

08:59.480 --> 09:00.879
Have you brought your ID?

09:00.879 --> 09:01.480
Stop it.

09:01.480 --> 09:01.879
Here.

09:01.879 --> 09:02.600
Help me.

09:04.879 --> 09:05.480
Work quickly.

09:05.480 --> 09:06.720
When we're finished, we'll go home quickly

09:06.720 --> 09:07.639
quickly dry or dissolve

09:09.840 --> 09:10.919
your face comes out

09:16.679 --> 09:17.639
have you finished looking?

09:18.080 --> 09:18.919
Wait.

09:26.039 --> 09:27.799
If you don't want to come,

09:27.799 --> 09:28.840
What are you doing?

09:28.840 --> 09:30.000
It's me.

09:30.440 --> 09:32.440
At that time fighting with guests,

09:32.440 --> 09:34.080
made Boss Zhou angry.

09:34.559 --> 09:35.440
Because I,

09:35.440 --> 09:37.279
because I.

09:39.519 --> 09:40.759
How is Boss Zhou?

09:46.399 --> 09:47.399
I'm asking you.

09:49.559 --> 09:50.639
Mute.

09:54.440 --> 09:55.399
Can not hear?

09:56.039 --> 09:58.320
Boss Zhou recently married his second wife.

09:58.639 --> 09:59.559
He married a second wife

09:59.559 --> 10:00.919
it's all money to exploit us

10:01.399 --> 10:02.919
in your opinion second family

10:02.919 --> 10:04.759
is he also part of us?

10:07.399 --> 10:08.440
You're a kid

10:09.159 --> 10:10.120
It's finished?

10:10.600 --> 10:11.200
Go with me.

10:11.200 --> 10:11.600
Go away.

10:11.600 --> 10:12.440
Go away.

10:12.440 --> 10:13.200
Go ahead.

10:15.039 --> 10:16.759
Come on, come in quickly.

10:20.960 --> 10:22.120
Fast.

10:22.279 --> 10:22.879
Fast.

10:33.080 --> 10:34.000
Hello, sir

10:45.120 --> 10:46.120
time to eat

10:46.120 --> 10:46.840
here, here, lined up.

10:46.840 --> 10:47.320
Here.

10:49.600 --> 10:50.840
Here. Fast.

10:52.720 --> 10:53.720
Go there!

10:55.039 --> 10:55.799
Fast!

11:00.000 --> 11:00.399
This.

11:00.399 --> 11:02.080
You guys pick this up

11:02.080 --> 11:02.919
fast.

11:04.200 --> 11:05.279
Where is ours?

11:06.279 --> 11:07.000
Follow me.

11:08.480 --> 11:08.960
Road.

11:16.759 --> 11:17.600
Kapten Matsumoto.

11:17.960 --> 11:19.039
Dinner has arrived.

11:21.120 --> 11:21.720
This.

11:25.600 --> 11:26.600
What are you eating today?

11:30.960 --> 11:32.320
I'm talking to him.

11:34.600 --> 11:36.039
Kapten Matsumoto.

11:36.039 --> 11:37.200
He's mute.

11:40.519 --> 11:43.879
Senior officers don't be angry.

11:43.879 --> 11:44.240
That's it.

11:44.240 --> 11:45.840
Let me introduce you, okay?

11:46.159 --> 11:48.559
Today's dish is this white cut chicken.

11:48.559 --> 11:49.720
Boiled eggplant with oil.

11:50.039 --> 11:50.919
Shrimp fried in oil,

11:50.919 --> 11:52.039
white grilled salty

11:52.320 --> 11:53.519
Iga babi Hu Jiang

11:53.519 --> 11:55.240
and also mustard soup

11:55.720 --> 11:57.039
these vegetables are delicious.

11:57.480 --> 11:57.840
Hurry up.

11:57.840 --> 11:59.120
Senior officers, eat slowly.

11:59.120 --> 12:00.159
I'll deliver the food first.

12:01.639 --> 12:02.759
Stay cool.

12:02.759 --> 12:04.440
We will go back to the way it was before

12:04.440 --> 12:06.320
we will provide the best food for you.

12:06.840 --> 12:08.039
Sir, very good.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.200
Take good care of the chiefs.

12:12.200 --> 12:13.559
I accompanied him to deliver vegetables.

12:17.600 --> 12:18.840
No need, I'll go alone.

12:24.440 --> 12:25.559
Stupid!

12:25.559 --> 12:26.440
What are you doing?

12:26.440 --> 12:27.320
No points?

12:27.320 --> 12:28.480
Be careful.

12:28.480 --> 12:30.320
Is the King okay?

12:30.799 --> 12:31.440
Look at it.

12:32.960 --> 12:33.480
Fast.

12:34.480 --> 12:35.440
I'm telling you.

12:35.440 --> 12:36.240
Give me eyes.

12:36.240 --> 12:37.200
Hear not?

12:38.399 --> 12:39.159
Pak,

12:39.480 --> 12:41.000
Then I'll go first.

12:45.080 --> 12:46.080
What are you doing?

12:47.039 --> 12:47.919
Wait a minute

12:51.720 --> 12:52.480
shrimp

12:53.000 --> 12:53.799
Good stuff.

12:53.799 --> 12:54.360
Shrimp.

12:54.360 --> 12:54.960
Fall to the floor.

12:58.759 --> 12:59.279
You...

13:00.039 --> 13:01.279
Eat it.

13:02.840 --> 13:04.480
Thank you sir

13:04.480 --> 13:05.840
eat it

13:09.360 --> 13:10.200
Shrimp is good stuff.

13:10.200 --> 13:11.120
Shrimp must eat.

13:11.559 --> 13:11.840
Shrimp?

13:14.600 --> 13:15.279
Very delicious.

13:16.279 --> 13:17.600
Thank you, senior officer.

13:21.240 --> 13:22.159
Wait!

13:26.039 --> 13:26.840
This side street

13:33.360 --> 13:34.120
go quickly!

14:03.559 --> 14:04.480
Hear not?

14:05.240 --> 14:06.360
I'm afraid I won't be able to catch up.

14:06.720 --> 14:08.600
He did something to the tow truck.

14:34.559 --> 14:35.519
Who's that?

14:42.799 --> 14:44.159
Go, hurry. We'll get caught.

14:46.159 --> 14:46.759
Help me

14:48.039 --> 14:49.159
help me

14:49.159 --> 14:49.960
I beg you.

14:51.639 --> 14:53.080
If we don't leave, we'll be found out.

15:02.799 --> 15:04.279
He's seen us.

15:04.279 --> 15:05.440
If you don't help him, you will be found out.

16:07.480 --> 16:08.799
Foreman Sun had already gone far away.

16:09.200 --> 16:10.279
Thank you for helping me.

16:10.639 --> 16:12.080
Earlier if I was caught,

16:12.080 --> 16:12.720
I will definitely die.

16:12.720 --> 16:14.720
Now you will die too, understand?

16:15.440 --> 16:16.639
Wait.

16:17.200 --> 16:18.559
He works in a uniform factory.

16:18.799 --> 16:19.559
If you don't kill him,

16:19.559 --> 16:20.879
he's going to leak us!

16:21.519 --> 16:22.879
I... I won't tell you guys!

16:22.879 --> 16:24.679
I just want to steal things to fill my stomach.

16:24.759 --> 16:26.039
I have absolutely no idea what you guys are doing.

16:26.120 --> 16:27.240
You wild child!

16:27.240 --> 16:28.440
Ruining our big plans.

16:28.440 --> 16:28.759
No.

16:28.759 --> 16:29.320
Wait.

16:33.080 --> 16:34.120
You climb the wall

16:34.480 --> 16:35.960
to steal food to fill the stomach.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Correct.

16:38.279 --> 16:40.440
Our dinner is just a bowl of porridge, a loaf of bread.

16:40.679 --> 16:42.039
Not full at all.

16:43.399 --> 16:44.240
Where do you want to steal it?

16:44.840 --> 16:45.759
foreman Sun

16:46.000 --> 16:47.759
The stroller has an iron bucket

16:48.200 --> 16:49.480
there is bread in it

16:50.720 --> 16:51.759
how do you know?

16:52.279 --> 16:54.440
In foreman Sun's iron bucket are there buns?

16:55.759 --> 16:57.039
I stole it once.

16:59.039 --> 16:59.679
Where

16:59.919 --> 17:01.679
once before

17:01.919 --> 17:03.919
I work in a barren place

17:04.279 --> 17:05.640
I saw foreman Sun pushing a trolley

17:05.640 --> 17:06.799
past there.

17:07.119 --> 17:08.039
I'm thinking

17:08.519 --> 17:09.279
what is on the iron barrel?

17:09.279 --> 17:11.200
is there food in it?

17:11.200 --> 17:12.039
So I followed him

17:12.440 --> 17:13.960
up to the warehouse door

17:14.400 --> 17:16.240
foreman Sun opened the warehouse door and entered

17:17.079 --> 17:18.799
the stroller stopped there

17:18.799 --> 17:19.960
I took the opportunity to get closer

17:19.960 --> 17:21.279
to open the iron box.

17:21.680 --> 17:23.960
Inside it turned out to be full of meat buns.

17:24.359 --> 17:25.480
I took two then ran.

17:26.119 --> 17:26.920
Don't smell it again.

17:27.720 --> 17:29.119
Remember which warehouse?

17:30.240 --> 17:31.079
Still remember.

17:31.079 --> 17:32.440
Is warehouse number 23

17:32.720 --> 17:33.720
Do you know the way?

17:34.279 --> 17:35.160
Know.

17:35.160 --> 17:36.039
Take us away.

17:36.400 --> 17:37.640
Otherwise, I will kill you!

17:38.519 --> 17:39.240
Good.

17:39.240 --> 17:39.839
Road.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.119
What way?

17:45.480 --> 17:46.240
Over there.

17:46.240 --> 17:46.920
Good.

17:49.119 --> 17:49.799
Possible.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.000
Why did he come back again?

18:03.559 --> 18:04.559
Look at this bucket,

18:04.839 --> 18:06.279
we didn't bring it here, right?

18:06.880 --> 18:08.319
This means he has finished delivering the food.

18:09.039 --> 18:10.319
What he took was yesterday's bucket

18:13.039 --> 18:13.519
street

18:15.000 --> 18:15.279
Road.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.240
Here.

18:28.240 --> 18:29.960
This is warehouse number 23.

18:30.759 --> 18:32.160
When I came,

18:32.799 --> 18:34.200
here it is guarded by Japanese soldiers.

18:34.400 --> 18:35.599
I took advantage of them going to the toilet.

18:35.599 --> 18:36.640
just got the buns

18:37.680 --> 18:38.759
are you sure?

18:38.759 --> 18:39.519
Confident.

18:45.200 --> 18:45.839
Good.

18:46.559 --> 18:47.440
Hurry home.

18:47.440 --> 18:48.559
It's time to share the food.

18:53.279 --> 18:54.079
I guess.

18:54.599 --> 18:56.000
You must be fighting Japan, right?

18:56.359 --> 18:57.599
Stop talking nonsense!

18:59.279 --> 19:00.160
Still have.

19:00.160 --> 19:01.000
Remember, okay?

19:01.440 --> 19:02.599
Don't tell anyone

19:02.920 --> 19:04.000
can't tell anyone else.

19:04.480 --> 19:06.400
Was it just that I didn't say one word?

19:07.440 --> 19:08.960
I am also an opponent of Japan.

19:13.039 --> 19:13.920
You ask him.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.599
Aren't you afraid he'll betray us?

19:31.839 --> 19:33.759
One day if I'm betrayed,

19:34.160 --> 19:35.400
then it must not be him.

19:41.839 --> 19:44.400
The counterfeit money factory is definitely here.

19:44.759 --> 19:46.400
But don't you find it strange?

19:46.759 --> 19:47.960
This important place

19:47.960 --> 19:49.200
not even the military police were there.

19:49.640 --> 19:51.000
It's also too quiet.

19:54.279 --> 19:55.119
I'll go take a look.

19:56.839 --> 19:58.000
Now it's time to eat.

19:58.319 --> 20:00.720
The Military Police must have delivered buns for them.

20:01.119 --> 20:02.680
Because the buns were sent here,

20:02.920 --> 20:04.160
there's definitely no problem

20:08.440 --> 20:09.440
the time is almost here,

20:09.920 --> 20:10.839
go quickly

20:31.119 --> 20:31.920
Hello, senior officer.

20:39.000 --> 20:39.839
Thank you sir

20:40.160 --> 20:41.359
I am not going to

20:46.200 --> 20:47.599
do you drive a car?

20:47.599 --> 20:48.160
Correct.

20:48.480 --> 20:49.480
I'm a car driver

20:49.519 --> 20:51.680
How long have you been coming to the hotel?

20:51.680 --> 20:53.720
Soon, one month more.

20:56.200 --> 20:58.200
What about Mr. Zhou's legs?

21:00.920 --> 21:01.519
What's that?

21:01.839 --> 21:04.519
I heard last week

21:04.519 --> 21:07.039
Boss Zhou you guys had a car accident.

21:07.839 --> 21:09.119
His leg is broken.

21:09.480 --> 21:11.519
How is the recovery going?

21:12.839 --> 21:13.480
It's much better.

21:13.960 --> 21:15.920
The food lately has been delicious.

21:16.440 --> 21:17.880
Please convey my regards to him.

21:18.480 --> 21:19.119
Good, sir.

21:19.119 --> 21:19.880
Good.

21:36.359 --> 21:37.599
Where are you two going?

21:37.880 --> 21:39.039
Shrimp on the floor is not clean

21:39.039 --> 21:40.200
immediately after eating diarrhea.

21:40.640 --> 21:41.559
Pack your things

21:41.559 --> 21:42.440
get out of here quickly

21:43.440 --> 21:44.160
go go

21:44.519 --> 21:45.440
everyone go!

21:50.759 --> 21:51.640
How

21:52.720 --> 21:54.359
The counterfeit money factory is in warehouse 23.

21:56.960 --> 21:58.480
Do you have any new discoveries?

21:58.480 --> 22:00.000
To the left of the workshop entrance

22:00.000 --> 22:01.200
there is a red button,

22:01.200 --> 22:02.359
should have been an alarm.

22:03.720 --> 22:06.000
Factory producing weapons and materials for the Japanese army

22:06.000 --> 22:07.759
will set an alarm like this.

22:08.119 --> 22:08.839
We have to think of a way

22:08.839 --> 22:10.200
so that the warning is not triggered.

22:14.319 --> 22:16.160
Now there is still 1 hour

22:16.160 --> 22:17.359
there's still an hour.

22:17.799 --> 22:19.559
We gather with the Storm Team first.

22:19.880 --> 22:21.640
We will create a specific action plan

22:21.640 --> 22:23.519
according to the latest situation we have.

22:24.039 --> 22:24.559
Good.

22:46.440 --> 22:47.480
Director Jiang.

22:47.480 --> 22:49.680
I'm Storm Team Leader, Tao Dachun.

22:50.440 --> 22:50.960
Two!

22:50.960 --> 22:51.640
Two!

22:52.799 --> 22:53.839
All members of the Storm Team...

22:53.839 --> 22:55.279
Listen to Director Jiang's instructions.

22:56.920 --> 22:58.960
Director Jiang, you guys are great.

22:59.480 --> 23:01.240
Can sneak into Japanese factories

23:01.240 --> 23:02.359
These are all blessings

23:02.359 --> 23:04.559
someone helped us get a labor certificate.

23:05.039 --> 23:06.079
Who is that good?

23:06.920 --> 23:08.920
I can't tell you his name.

23:09.279 --> 23:10.599
I can only tell you.

23:10.599 --> 23:12.000
He is the one we saved

23:12.000 --> 23:13.519
people from the evil department

23:13.799 --> 23:15.200
code, 5 Red Hearts.

23:15.519 --> 23:16.319
Understand.

23:17.720 --> 23:18.640
This is Hong Tao Wu.

23:18.640 --> 23:19.480
Hello, Captain Tao.

23:20.720 --> 23:21.880
Still a girl

23:22.559 --> 23:23.440
great, great.

23:24.200 --> 23:25.319
He is the Captain

23:25.319 --> 23:27.319
chairman of the Sixth Team of the Su and Zhejiang Action Committee.

23:27.319 --> 23:28.200
Liu Wuchang.

23:28.720 --> 23:29.400
Two.

23:31.720 --> 23:32.519
This.

23:34.799 --> 23:36.359
He is...

23:40.920 --> 23:42.200
I introduce myself

23:43.759 --> 23:44.720
chen Jia Ping

23:48.160 --> 23:49.279
a traitor.

23:49.960 --> 23:50.720
Traitor?

23:51.759 --> 23:52.960
This problem is long to tell.

23:53.480 --> 23:55.319
But he is now on our side.

23:58.039 --> 23:58.720
Two.

23:59.920 --> 24:00.519
Director Jiang.

24:01.880 --> 24:02.920
I want to know right away

24:02.920 --> 24:04.599
division of factory buildings uniformly.

24:04.599 --> 24:06.519
To create a specific action plan.

24:06.519 --> 24:07.119
Good.

24:07.480 --> 24:08.160
Please

24:08.160 --> 24:08.640
Please

24:15.559 --> 24:16.680
have you heard clearly, right?

24:16.960 --> 24:17.799
Already.

24:18.640 --> 24:19.759
This operation,

24:20.119 --> 24:21.799
there can be no mistakes in every procedure.

24:23.000 --> 24:23.960
This time it's our mission

24:24.400 --> 24:25.319
can only succeed,

24:25.720 --> 24:26.880
cannot fail.

24:26.880 --> 24:27.480
Good.

24:27.480 --> 24:28.359
Good.

24:32.759 --> 24:33.799
The time is almost here.

24:34.640 --> 24:35.480
Get ready to go

24:36.160 --> 24:36.599
Good.

24:37.799 --> 24:38.680
You stay here,

24:41.319 --> 24:42.119
Why?

24:49.960 --> 24:50.960
Stay cool.

24:50.960 --> 24:52.160
I won't kill him

24:52.799 --> 24:54.480
after the operation is complete

24:54.480 --> 24:55.559
I will let it go.

24:57.640 --> 24:59.640
I'm also not interested in participating in your actions.

25:00.640 --> 25:01.680
Director Jiang?

25:02.480 --> 25:03.720
Can let my wife stay here

25:03.720 --> 25:04.759
accompany me to chat?

25:05.240 --> 25:06.319
What do you think?

25:06.599 --> 25:07.680
He must join in the action.

25:07.920 --> 25:08.480
Good.

25:12.880 --> 25:13.720
My wife.

25:15.160 --> 25:15.720
Here.

25:19.319 --> 25:21.880
Then I won't be able to protect you anymore.

25:22.920 --> 25:23.720
act,

25:23.720 --> 25:25.240
you have to be careful.

25:27.759 --> 25:28.599
Look at it.

25:29.319 --> 25:30.440
They did this to me.

25:31.559 --> 25:32.720
Work hard for them.

25:33.519 --> 25:34.559
Totally inappropriate.

25:39.759 --> 25:40.599
Bai Qian.

25:40.599 --> 25:41.319
Until.

25:41.319 --> 25:42.640
Have you remembered your movement task?

25:42.640 --> 25:43.240
Already.

25:43.559 --> 25:45.039
Later, when you act,

25:45.440 --> 25:46.119
be careful

25:46.119 --> 25:47.359
far away!

25:48.039 --> 25:49.079
Don't come forward.

25:56.240 --> 25:57.440
Before 8.15

25:57.440 --> 25:59.240
Drive the car to the T-junction behind the military clothing factory

25:59.240 --> 26:01.039
Remember, you have to turn off the lights.

26:01.039 --> 26:02.240
Turn from the west.

26:02.599 --> 26:04.400
Avoiding help that might come.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.640
Which may come.

26:06.640 --> 26:07.319
Good.

26:09.400 --> 26:10.079
Move.

26:10.799 --> 26:11.519
See you later

26:20.119 --> 26:21.920
why not let Chen Jiaping come along?

26:22.920 --> 26:23.880
Japanese maybe

26:23.880 --> 26:25.720
already got PKT banknotes

26:26.039 --> 26:28.160
and it should be under this counterfeit money factory

26:28.640 --> 26:29.480
our mission this time

26:29.480 --> 26:31.119
not only destroying counterfeit money factories,

26:31.119 --> 26:32.119
also took back the coins

26:34.599 --> 26:36.279
although Chen Jia Ping has helped us a lot

26:36.279 --> 26:38.119
but he's not our guy

26:38.839 --> 26:40.960
if he knew the news about the bronze version,...

26:41.200 --> 26:43.400
Even to the point of leaking information to the Communist Party.

26:44.319 --> 26:46.359
That will have a big impact on our plans.

27:17.880 --> 27:19.039
Already home.

27:29.960 --> 27:31.079
In front of the door there were 2 Japanese soldiers

27:31.079 --> 27:31.960
and foreman Sun

27:35.720 --> 27:37.119
other than the gatekeeper

27:37.599 --> 27:38.680
in total there were ten Japanese soldiers.

27:38.680 --> 27:39.519
There were nine who left.

27:40.079 --> 27:41.680
There should be one more person

27:45.359 --> 27:46.559
Mrs. Agung smokes.

27:48.319 --> 27:48.920
Here.

28:19.599 --> 28:20.680
Did you see the red alarm

28:20.680 --> 28:21.880
in that room?

28:23.000 --> 28:23.880
Have seen it.

28:25.079 --> 28:26.400
Get rid of this guy first.

28:47.200 --> 28:47.839
Go away.

30:47.519 --> 30:48.200
Key

31:01.720 --> 31:02.480
Mr. Head,

31:07.599 --> 31:09.160
This is a fake paper

31:09.519 --> 31:11.279
but where did this guy go

31:11.279 --> 31:12.279
where is the equipment?

31:24.279 --> 31:25.319
There is a secret passage here.

31:29.319 --> 31:30.519
You guys stand up first, don't move.

31:30.759 --> 31:32.160
I went down to see what was happening.

31:32.720 --> 31:33.400
Chief.

32:01.400 --> 32:02.160
How

32:04.039 --> 32:05.759
the counterfeit money factory must have been transferred.

32:05.759 --> 32:07.480
The bottom part is clogged.

32:07.480 --> 32:08.640
Blocked.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.279
Could it possibly explode?

32:11.279 --> 32:13.000
The counterfeit money factory must be underground.

32:13.240 --> 32:15.000
Otherwise we wouldn't find fake banknotes

32:15.440 --> 32:16.240
It is just

32:16.799 --> 32:17.559
Why?

32:18.000 --> 32:19.319
They suddenly moved.

32:34.119 --> 32:34.799
Mr Director,

32:35.160 --> 32:36.440
what are your plans now?

32:43.079 --> 32:43.960
Disband first.

32:44.119 --> 32:44.880
Road.

32:46.160 --> 32:46.920
Road.

33:31.079 --> 33:31.880
Are you okay?

33:32.640 --> 33:33.880
How did you get out?

33:35.480 --> 33:36.559
I'll tell you later.

33:37.039 --> 33:38.559
The Military Police Squadron will arrive soon.

33:38.880 --> 33:40.240
We definitely can't get out of the main door.

33:40.799 --> 33:41.599
So how?

33:43.000 --> 33:43.720
Blow up the wall.

33:43.720 --> 33:44.480
Hide.

33:44.480 --> 33:45.480
Then ran outside

33:45.480 --> 33:46.759
smash the wall and hide.

33:46.759 --> 33:47.559
Hide.

33:58.319 --> 33:59.359
Come with me back.

34:00.400 --> 34:00.640
Fast!

34:17.199 --> 34:17.960
Hurry up.

34:18.920 --> 34:19.679
Hurry up.

34:40.880 --> 34:41.719
Road!

34:44.679 --> 34:46.159
Protect Director Jiang.

34:46.159 --> 34:47.920
Split up, see you at the warehouse

34:47.920 --> 34:48.880
See you at the warehouse

34:49.440 --> 34:50.119
go

35:10.559 --> 35:11.079
Hurry up.

35:11.079 --> 35:11.599
We go.

35:13.639 --> 35:14.519
What does it mean?

35:14.840 --> 35:15.840
I'm sorry.

35:16.719 --> 35:18.159
Even though you saved us

35:18.480 --> 35:19.639
I am very grateful to you

35:20.760 --> 35:22.400
but you know too much.

35:24.679 --> 35:25.960
If I want to betray you,

35:25.960 --> 35:27.280
I'll wait until now.

35:27.559 --> 35:28.599
You count

35:28.920 --> 35:30.480
I really will believe it

35:30.760 --> 35:33.119
are you just a common traitor?

35:33.719 --> 35:35.320
You can lie to the left twin,

35:35.679 --> 35:37.000
but you can't lie to me.

35:38.079 --> 35:39.599
I really shouldn't have saved you.

35:40.440 --> 35:42.320
Which you shouldn't do too much.

35:42.800 --> 35:44.760
You shouldn't be involved in our operation.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.320
Nor should he marry Zuo Shuang Tao.

35:48.400 --> 35:49.639
However, I don't regret it.

35:49.960 --> 35:50.880
For the woman I love,

35:50.880 --> 35:52.000
whatever is appropriate.

35:52.679 --> 35:54.039
Don't know, Director Jiang.

35:54.039 --> 35:55.400
For the woman you love,

35:55.639 --> 35:57.480
What can Miss Han Lu do?

36:13.800 --> 36:14.559
Wait!

36:15.320 --> 36:16.079
Do not move

36:22.199 --> 36:24.239
You think we'll believe your bullshit?

36:24.480 --> 36:25.840
How did Bai Qian die?

36:26.119 --> 36:28.920
Why would the Japanese know our plans?

36:28.920 --> 36:30.719
If Chen Jiaping really wants to betray us

36:31.159 --> 36:32.920
why do you still want to help us?

36:32.920 --> 36:34.719
He just wants to save you.

36:40.760 --> 36:42.480
Of course I just want to save my wife

36:43.119 --> 36:45.000
who wants to help bastards like you?

36:45.000 --> 36:45.960
According to you

36:46.519 --> 36:47.880
where is Director Jiang?

36:48.159 --> 36:49.239
You go ask him?

36:49.760 --> 36:50.840
Why ask me?

36:50.840 --> 36:51.719
Say no?

36:51.960 --> 36:52.440
If you still don't say so

36:52.440 --> 36:53.400
believe it or not I will shoot you dead

36:53.400 --> 36:54.360
lower the gun

36:56.039 --> 36:57.480
put the gun down.

37:02.079 --> 37:02.840
Let him go.

37:03.400 --> 37:04.199
Why?

37:05.079 --> 37:05.960
I believe him

37:06.320 --> 37:07.880
Do you believe Chen Jia Ping?

37:07.880 --> 37:09.000
He is a traitor,

37:09.000 --> 37:10.320
I believe in the Left Twin.

37:11.360 --> 37:13.039
So I also trust the people he trusts

37:14.519 --> 37:16.079
take Chen Jia Ping away

37:16.559 --> 37:17.639
treat him well

37:17.880 --> 37:19.920
don't interfere in our affairs anymore.

37:21.039 --> 37:21.960
Stay cool.

37:22.719 --> 37:23.840
There won't be a next time.

37:35.480 --> 37:36.920
Do you know why

37:38.000 --> 37:40.159
won't let you join the final act?

37:41.480 --> 37:42.320
Why

37:42.519 --> 37:44.480
because of the CCP copper coins

37:45.280 --> 37:47.559
very likely fell into the hands of the Japanese.

37:47.960 --> 37:49.719
At first he thought he could find it

37:50.280 --> 37:51.519
in a counterfeit money factory,

37:51.840 --> 37:53.239
however, he doesn't want you to know.

37:55.559 --> 37:56.400
According to you,

37:57.519 --> 37:59.400
Where has the counterfeit money factory been transferred to?

38:02.599 --> 38:04.719
Now I also have no clue anymore.

38:11.639 --> 38:12.320
What is it?

38:12.960 --> 38:14.119
Who are you really?

38:15.000 --> 38:15.960
What? Who am I?

38:16.679 --> 38:17.719
Karena Jiang Zhaoguo

38:17.719 --> 38:19.119
have the same suspicions as me,

38:20.079 --> 38:21.639
just wanted to kill you.

38:21.960 --> 38:23.079
Is...

38:26.559 --> 38:27.840
Are you from over there?

38:29.440 --> 38:31.320
What's over here?

38:31.920 --> 38:32.760
Me

38:33.719 --> 38:35.039
is your husband.

38:37.239 --> 38:39.119
You just need to remember this.

38:44.320 --> 38:46.119
I'm guessing you won't talk much either.

38:46.800 --> 38:48.559
It's just that one day I was afraid.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.679
You're not even my husband

38:54.639 --> 38:55.719
other?

38:55.719 --> 38:57.039
I dare not guarantee

38:57.440 --> 38:58.800
but only this thing

38:59.119 --> 39:00.760
I really promise

39:14.519 --> 39:15.280
Tuan Jiang.

39:15.880 --> 39:18.159
Here are the ice cubes and whiskey I prepared for you.

39:20.400 --> 39:21.119
Thank You.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.960
Mr. Jiang is really great

39:24.280 --> 39:27.119
he can find the location of our underground factory

39:29.559 --> 39:31.400
I saw a great one

39:31.400 --> 39:32.679
it should be you

39:33.239 --> 39:35.119
Dahua hotel, my whereabouts were exposed.

39:35.440 --> 39:36.280
Today,

39:36.679 --> 39:39.239
I've planned this all

39:40.199 --> 39:42.000
in the end it was in vain.

39:44.840 --> 39:45.960
I like to talk openly

39:45.960 --> 39:47.760
talk openly like this.

39:50.199 --> 39:52.039
Mr. Jiang can stay here temporarily.

39:52.679 --> 39:53.480
Your daily needs

39:53.480 --> 39:54.760
we will prepare it for you.

39:55.079 --> 39:55.800
Oh yes

39:55.800 --> 39:58.360
In the room I have prepared a jacket for you.

39:58.960 --> 40:00.360
No need for a suit.

40:01.679 --> 40:02.679
This one...

40:02.960 --> 40:03.599
Quite good.

40:05.159 --> 40:06.119
One.

40:06.440 --> 40:07.280
I can drink.

40:08.079 --> 40:09.800
But that doesn't mean that after drinking your wine,

40:10.199 --> 40:11.639
I will discuss cooperation with you.

40:12.440 --> 40:13.000
Future problems,

40:13.000 --> 40:14.320
we can talk slowly.

40:14.800 --> 40:15.559
However,

40:16.039 --> 40:20.039
I want to ask Mr. Jiang something.

40:21.719 --> 40:22.400
Say it.

40:25.239 --> 40:26.960
Where did this labor certificate come from?

40:27.079 --> 40:27.840
Faked?

40:28.639 --> 40:30.119
We've checked.

40:30.559 --> 40:31.880
The labor certificate is genuine.

40:32.239 --> 40:34.639
In each acquaintance letter there must be a different number.

40:34.920 --> 40:36.119
If you look at this number,

40:36.480 --> 40:37.719
we found

40:37.719 --> 40:39.119
that this labor certificate

40:39.119 --> 40:41.320
comes from Taihe commercial bank.

40:41.800 --> 40:43.360
In Chongqing there are also our people.

40:43.960 --> 40:45.639
We recently received information,

40:45.639 --> 40:48.840
there was a military member named Hong Tao 5,

40:48.840 --> 40:50.960
lurking inside Taihe Company.

40:51.440 --> 40:52.639
This labor certificate

40:53.119 --> 40:54.960
is a gift from Hong Tao Wu, right?

40:57.760 --> 40:59.679
I don't know Taihe Company.

41:05.480 --> 41:06.400
Tuan Jiang,

41:06.920 --> 41:09.039
At least we have respected you.

41:09.559 --> 41:11.360
I hope you will also give me an honor.

41:12.480 --> 41:13.639
Cooperation or not,

41:13.960 --> 41:15.639
we can talk about it later.

41:16.320 --> 41:17.360
But this thing

41:17.639 --> 41:19.360
You have to give an account to me.

41:20.440 --> 41:21.199
If not,

41:22.079 --> 41:23.760
everyone will feel embarrassed.

41:37.639 --> 41:39.039
The counterfeit money factory has been transferred,

41:39.039 --> 41:40.559
nothing worked.

41:40.559 --> 41:42.159
We lost a lot of teams.

41:42.519 --> 41:44.119
I might be involved too.

41:44.119 --> 41:44.719
Besides that,

41:45.159 --> 41:47.000
The Zuo twins are already doubting my identity.

42:09.199 --> 42:10.280
Wang Dapu, this person.

42:10.280 --> 42:12.000
Financial expert, copper engraver.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.159
Has participated in minting and issuing coins.

42:14.159 --> 42:15.320
True identity

42:15.320 --> 42:17.280
is a military spy with a wild goose code.

42:17.880 --> 42:19.400
After stealing copper coins,

42:19.400 --> 42:20.960
fled to Shanghai.

42:21.480 --> 42:23.679
There is information that this person was captured by the Japanese.

42:24.639 --> 42:27.440
If there is new information, contact the organization.

42:28.559 --> 42:29.760
Everything,

42:29.800 --> 42:32.440
today we invite a special expert

42:32.519 --> 42:33.639
to give a lecture to you

42:33.639 --> 42:34.559
welcome

42:44.719 --> 42:45.639
good greetings to classmates
