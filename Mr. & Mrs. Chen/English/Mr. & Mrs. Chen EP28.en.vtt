01:33.879 --> 01:35.439
I did use you.

01:36.439 --> 01:37.319
But when I saw you,

01:37.319 --> 01:38.519
to see you.

01:40.239 --> 01:41.000
What about you?

01:41.439 --> 01:42.280
Are you happy?

01:45.319 --> 01:46.439
I knew it.

01:47.120 --> 01:48.799
I don't want you to be involved.

01:50.599 --> 01:52.519
I want you to leave safely.

01:53.560 --> 01:55.000
Why do you still want to marry me?

01:55.400 --> 01:57.000
You won't go?

01:57.760 --> 01:58.920
I think

02:00.319 --> 02:02.120
I'll fulfill my promise to you.

02:02.840 --> 02:03.760
Really?

02:05.120 --> 02:07.040
But if I marry you,

02:07.519 --> 02:09.919
It's just to kill Yamashita.

02:14.680 --> 02:15.639
Will you believe it?

02:16.360 --> 02:17.120
He would.

02:17.400 --> 02:18.400
No matter what.

02:20.240 --> 02:22.000
Do you think I love you?

02:22.000 --> 02:22.840
Certainly.

02:23.280 --> 02:25.080
You should be confident of yourself.

02:25.960 --> 02:27.479
Look how proud you are.

02:29.120 --> 02:30.680
You're really something.

02:43.120 --> 02:46.479
I thought you were killed by Officer Uchida.

02:47.560 --> 02:48.919
I was trying to save myself.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.360
I told Ueda that

02:51.520 --> 02:53.360
as long as I follow Wang Dapu,

02:53.360 --> 02:55.319
we might have a chance to get the copper plate.

02:57.759 --> 02:59.360
Uchida trusts you.

02:59.919 --> 03:01.000
Right.

03:01.439 --> 03:02.960
He trusts me more than you do.

03:04.680 --> 03:05.639
Is he mad at me?

03:08.599 --> 03:10.400
The Japanese gave the order.

03:11.439 --> 03:13.199
If I don't hand you over to the Imperial Prison, OK?

03:14.000 --> 03:15.520
That's right, Jiaping.

03:15.520 --> 03:16.120
Look at yourself.

03:16.360 --> 03:17.719
You were put in the detention center.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.840
But the Japanese never tortured you.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.520
They are all people, Manager Luo.

03:23.159 --> 03:24.439
To help you

03:24.439 --> 03:25.560
to plead for you.

03:27.000 --> 03:27.800
Look at this.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.560
Shuangtao defended me.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.000
Thank you.

03:32.280 --> 03:33.000
Look at this.

03:33.199 --> 03:34.039
All right.

03:34.039 --> 03:35.479
I know you are wronged.

03:36.000 --> 03:36.800
I will

03:37.120 --> 03:38.879
I'll hold a banquet for you

03:38.879 --> 03:40.120
get rid of the old to make way for the new

03:44.439 --> 03:45.439
by the way, Luo,

03:45.840 --> 03:47.159
how is the business recently?

03:47.719 --> 03:48.719
Still the same.

03:49.360 --> 03:50.560
Without Zhao An,

03:51.439 --> 03:52.800
this is much quieter.

03:53.879 --> 03:55.560
That's strange.

03:56.159 --> 03:59.719
Zhao An has so many lives.

04:00.719 --> 04:04.159
How can he be the five of hearts?

04:05.879 --> 04:07.039
How many lives

04:07.039 --> 04:09.039
of Wang Tianmu's hands?

04:09.039 --> 04:10.479
We've already pledged our allegiance here.

04:11.520 --> 04:12.639
That's right.

04:13.360 --> 04:14.479
Now,

04:14.479 --> 04:16.720
zhao An has finally pulled out the candle.

04:17.279 --> 04:19.800
From now on, Taihe Trading Firm

04:20.800 --> 04:22.399
will be controlled by us.

04:23.279 --> 04:25.519
Do you remember Xiucai Qian who guarded the door?

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Even he

04:27.000 --> 04:27.839
want to seek help from me.

04:27.839 --> 04:29.000
And work for me.

04:30.800 --> 04:32.319
Many people nowadays

04:32.959 --> 04:34.800
they should know about themselves.

04:36.240 --> 04:37.199
Qian Xiucai,

04:39.360 --> 04:40.240
by the way,

04:41.160 --> 04:42.759
copper coins of the Communist Party of China

04:42.759 --> 04:44.639
the copper coins?

04:44.639 --> 04:46.240
I didn't only see

04:46.240 --> 04:47.800
at the same time.

04:48.399 --> 04:50.560
The Japanese have been dying for this.

04:51.160 --> 04:54.319
A combination of military damage and economic damage.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.399
It seems that the Japanese executives

04:56.720 --> 04:59.360
has changed their thinking.

05:01.199 --> 05:02.240
What a pity!

05:03.560 --> 05:05.639
If I can get this bronze plate,

05:05.639 --> 05:07.439
let alone this is your car,

05:07.439 --> 05:09.639
I didn't even bother to sit in Naoki Uchida's car.

05:11.399 --> 05:12.959
You only talk big things.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.199
Think about our future.

05:17.079 --> 05:20.079
Now Japan and the United States are going to war.

05:20.399 --> 05:21.800
I'm afraid it's inevitable.

05:22.600 --> 05:23.839
The situation

05:24.959 --> 05:26.279
the situation in the future.

05:44.959 --> 05:45.279
Come on.

05:45.279 --> 05:46.000
Shuangtao.

05:46.439 --> 05:47.639
Go back and have a rest

05:47.639 --> 05:49.199
I have a few more words with Jiaping.

05:50.839 --> 05:52.040
Newspaper. Newspaper.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.360
What's the matter?

05:57.800 --> 05:59.160
I know you are wronged.

05:59.360 --> 06:00.720
Have a good rest.

06:00.720 --> 06:02.040
Don't go to work in a hurry.

06:04.680 --> 06:05.800
There's another thing.

06:06.319 --> 06:07.720
I made a deal recently.

06:08.399 --> 06:10.199
I have to find someone I'm trustworthy.

06:11.279 --> 06:12.600
Someone you trust.

06:12.600 --> 06:13.439
Well, there?

06:15.519 --> 06:17.480
The big spoon doesn't work well.

06:18.279 --> 06:20.319
I still need you the most.

06:22.720 --> 06:23.680
What deal?

06:24.600 --> 06:25.759
I'll tell you when.

06:26.680 --> 06:27.360
But you have to remember

06:27.360 --> 06:29.319
what I told you in the car.

06:29.759 --> 06:31.639
The Japanese are unreliable now.

06:32.040 --> 06:34.319
We have to think about our own future.

06:34.319 --> 06:36.319
You're making it sound unclear.

06:36.680 --> 06:38.000
But I'm telling you that

06:38.000 --> 06:39.600
don't think I'll forgive you.

06:42.120 --> 06:42.959
Have a good rest.

07:01.959 --> 07:03.759
I can understand now.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.959
To protect your identity,

07:08.439 --> 07:10.639
you secretly helped me.

07:12.240 --> 07:13.839
I thought they got information

07:15.079 --> 07:17.560
we got the information from you.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.199
For example, the time you saved people in Hongyun Hotel.

07:21.279 --> 07:23.079
Were leaked to me on purpose.

07:25.399 --> 07:27.480
You have helped me before.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.839
Just like the time that you killed Feng Qi.

07:31.560 --> 07:33.279
Without your evidence,

07:34.360 --> 07:35.839
I wouldn't have

07:35.839 --> 07:37.519
just confirm Feng Qi's crime.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.240
Do you think

07:43.439 --> 07:45.839
are we different bedfellows?

07:49.279 --> 07:50.040
It is.

07:51.399 --> 07:52.319
But that doesn't count

07:53.480 --> 07:55.000
even the dream of our couple

07:55.560 --> 07:57.199
will eventually come together.

08:00.439 --> 08:01.680
So you brought back

08:01.680 --> 08:03.279
some files about the CPC

08:03.279 --> 08:04.360
he wanted me to see

08:04.720 --> 08:06.160
Including the files of Lu.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.800
Gave a lot of thought to this.

08:10.480 --> 08:12.160
Back then, I made up my mind

08:12.160 --> 08:13.319
to win you over.

08:14.079 --> 08:15.839
But I can't be honest with you.

08:15.839 --> 08:17.639
So I can only

08:17.639 --> 08:20.160
In a subtle way.

08:21.399 --> 08:22.360
I have to say that

08:23.319 --> 08:24.959
you've been very helpful

08:25.920 --> 08:26.759
the ideological work.

08:28.199 --> 08:29.600
Because I know you.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.240
I know you.

08:32.759 --> 08:34.799
What kind of person you want to be.

08:37.519 --> 08:38.440
Think about

08:39.399 --> 08:42.120
the one where our respective missions

08:43.159 --> 08:44.600
Is that Ci'an Hospital?

08:45.120 --> 08:47.720
You must have been following the clue to the magpie.

08:48.240 --> 08:49.600
That's why you appeared there.

08:50.399 --> 08:51.279
That's right.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.120
We're investigating

08:53.720 --> 08:58.080
the formula of the paper used for the coin currency stolen by Juntong spies

08:58.320 --> 08:59.279
and the copper plate.

09:00.360 --> 09:01.679
Now thinking back,

09:04.360 --> 09:06.480
you are really good at acting.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.360
She knew about my identity,

09:08.720 --> 09:10.840
but pretended to be scared.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.120
If a man can act,

09:15.120 --> 09:18.159
he must be forced by your women.

09:23.799 --> 09:25.000
And confess yourself like this?

09:25.480 --> 09:26.279
Come on.

09:27.120 --> 09:29.480
How many other dramas and lies

09:29.919 --> 09:31.000
and how many lies you told me.

09:31.360 --> 09:32.639
I swear.

09:33.799 --> 09:35.399
Aside from my identity,

09:35.720 --> 09:37.120
about my identity.

09:41.519 --> 09:42.480
I don't believe that.

09:42.919 --> 09:44.399
When a man lies,

09:45.120 --> 09:48.240
It's only the first and countless times.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.039
You've lied to me before.

09:53.320 --> 09:54.320
That's different.

09:55.600 --> 09:56.799
Women lie

09:57.960 --> 09:59.960
so that men won't be sad.

10:01.279 --> 10:02.600
When a man lies,

10:03.399 --> 10:05.360
Is purely to lie to women.

10:10.960 --> 10:13.559
What kind of nonsense are you talking about?

10:25.480 --> 10:27.639
You intentionally exposed yourself that day,

10:27.919 --> 10:29.639
so you could join us

10:29.639 --> 10:31.320
to raid the counterfeit factory with us?

10:31.320 --> 10:33.120
I only saw that there is so much evidence

10:33.120 --> 10:35.600
and you didn't have a reason to think so

10:35.840 --> 10:36.799
and became anxious.

10:37.279 --> 10:38.120
Of course,

10:38.480 --> 10:40.639
the most important thing is your safety.

10:42.360 --> 10:43.720
The last sentence

10:44.159 --> 10:45.399
really touches me.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.600
Did you start to suspect me

10:50.600 --> 10:51.679
after that operation?

10:52.480 --> 10:54.039
I should've doubted you,

10:54.039 --> 10:55.240
but I didn't expect that

10:55.240 --> 10:58.360
that Zhao An replaced it.

10:58.360 --> 10:59.679
It was a nice design.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.759
What do you mean by that?

11:02.440 --> 11:04.000
Did you think

11:04.000 --> 11:05.639
that I should be inferior to you?

11:06.840 --> 11:07.840
I didn't say that.

11:08.279 --> 11:10.120
Otherwise, I won't let you know more

11:10.120 --> 11:12.480
the Communist Party's anti-Japanese actions

11:12.480 --> 11:13.840
and the communist ideology.

11:18.039 --> 11:19.240
I don't know either

11:20.320 --> 11:22.600
I know you well enough.

11:22.600 --> 11:23.559
Don't worry.

11:23.559 --> 11:25.000
It's enough for you to know me

11:25.440 --> 11:26.399
knowing me

11:26.399 --> 11:27.919
and you know us.

11:31.320 --> 11:32.840
I have now completely broken

11:33.919 --> 11:35.240
with Juntong.

11:40.720 --> 11:43.120
Would you accept an ex-military unification member?

11:44.240 --> 11:45.519
I'll testify for you!

11:46.200 --> 11:48.080
You're not like Jiang Zhaoguo and the others.

11:48.080 --> 11:49.399
You always insisted

11:49.399 --> 11:51.159
our call for unity

11:51.159 --> 11:52.399
that we have called for.

11:52.720 --> 11:55.039
Your thoughts and actions

11:55.440 --> 11:57.080
In thought and action.

11:59.879 --> 12:01.120
I'm ready.

12:02.480 --> 12:03.080
Alright.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.200
I'll report to the organization as soon as possible

12:05.200 --> 12:06.360
so that one day,

12:06.360 --> 12:07.840
that we can all

12:07.840 --> 12:10.080
as soon as possible.

12:10.679 --> 12:13.080
I'm looking forward to that day to come.

12:13.080 --> 12:13.639
Alright.

12:14.080 --> 12:16.639
But we need to be more careful

12:17.240 --> 12:18.679
while waiting.

12:19.039 --> 12:22.200
After all, you've taken away the copper plate from Jiang Zhaoguo.

12:22.639 --> 12:23.879
He must be

12:23.879 --> 12:26.000
he must be so exasperated that

12:26.000 --> 12:26.960
assassination.

12:26.960 --> 12:28.320
That's what he did.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.120
I know how they are.

12:31.120 --> 12:32.159
They can't handle me.

12:32.399 --> 12:34.120
Now we have the copper plate.

12:34.639 --> 12:37.759
When we find the paper formula of the coin,

12:38.080 --> 12:39.639
the real counterfeit factory

12:39.919 --> 12:41.559
my mission is over.

12:41.559 --> 12:42.759
I've got to finish

12:42.759 --> 12:43.720
with you.

12:45.440 --> 12:46.399
Four of clubs,

12:47.120 --> 12:48.080
five of hearts.

12:49.440 --> 12:51.120
We're officially together.

12:53.480 --> 12:55.039
Pay more attention to your safety.

12:55.559 --> 12:56.080
As for the business,

12:56.080 --> 12:56.919
let's not go there.

12:57.240 --> 12:58.960
I'll talk to Luo Guanqun

12:59.720 --> 13:03.399
tell her that my wife worked so hard for me

13:03.399 --> 13:05.600
and she's resting at home.

13:06.039 --> 13:07.159
You should stay at home.

13:07.159 --> 13:08.080
I won't go anywhere.

13:08.440 --> 13:09.039
Come on.

13:11.120 --> 13:12.000
What about you?

13:12.360 --> 13:12.960
I have to...

13:13.399 --> 13:14.720
I need to contact my superior.

13:20.080 --> 13:22.000
Who is your superior?

13:22.279 --> 13:23.960
How do you usually contact?

13:27.240 --> 13:28.600
My superior is...

13:30.559 --> 13:33.480
My superior is the Communist Party of China.

13:34.120 --> 13:35.600
The way we communicate with each other

13:35.879 --> 13:37.759
that's a communist ideology.

13:38.879 --> 13:40.679
That means he didn't say anything.

13:41.080 --> 13:43.080
He still doesn't treat me as one of his own.

13:51.519 --> 13:53.000
The copper coin has been recovered.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.120
Please indicate when and where to exchange the coins.

13:55.120 --> 13:56.480
In this operation,

13:56.480 --> 13:58.000
In the operation.

13:58.679 --> 14:00.919
She might not stay here for long.

14:00.919 --> 14:03.200
Zuo Shuangtao has known my identity.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.000
She has broken with Juntong

14:05.000 --> 14:07.399
to join the underground organizations of our Party.

14:07.399 --> 14:08.759
Please approve it.

14:29.399 --> 14:30.200
Come in.

14:35.879 --> 14:36.639
Manager Luo,

14:36.919 --> 14:38.080
there is a response.

14:39.320 --> 14:39.960
What about

14:40.840 --> 14:42.320
he agreed to our asking price.

14:44.600 --> 14:45.879
Next,

14:48.200 --> 14:49.399
one step at a time.

14:49.399 --> 14:50.320
Follow the plan.

14:50.879 --> 14:51.440
Yes

15:01.399 --> 15:02.320
nice to meet you, sir.

15:02.919 --> 15:05.000
I've booked a cafe on the second floor.

15:05.360 --> 15:06.279
This way, please.

15:15.799 --> 15:16.679
902.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.200
The magpie is in 902.

15:18.200 --> 15:18.799
Hurry!

15:18.799 --> 15:19.600
Yes

15:42.440 --> 15:43.159
mister.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.399
This place is sealed off.

16:17.039 --> 16:17.879
Get out of here!

16:27.879 --> 16:28.879
Let go of me!

16:34.879 --> 16:36.159
We've searched every body.

16:36.159 --> 16:37.279
I didn't find anything.

16:40.720 --> 16:41.799
That's impossible.

16:43.039 --> 16:44.480
I found something.

16:45.320 --> 16:46.639
The formula of the coin paper

16:47.600 --> 16:48.799
Is on him.

17:09.920 --> 17:10.599
Who's that?

17:11.240 --> 17:12.200
Who are you?

17:14.079 --> 17:15.359
You don't want to tell me?

17:16.079 --> 17:16.920
What are you talking about?

17:17.519 --> 17:18.559
I don't know.

17:29.079 --> 17:30.039
What are you doing?

17:31.720 --> 17:32.680
What do you want?

17:58.160 --> 17:59.119
See that?

17:59.119 --> 17:59.960
See that?

18:01.279 --> 18:01.960
Boss.

18:01.960 --> 18:04.079
What to do with that magpie?

18:04.480 --> 18:05.720
Not to be worth a hair

18:42.720 --> 18:43.599
I suspect that the magpie

18:43.599 --> 18:45.440
hid the formula in her wound.

18:45.880 --> 18:47.599
So I opened it with a dagger.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.279
But I didn't find it.

18:49.599 --> 18:51.480
But I found a piece of brown paper.

18:52.039 --> 18:53.920
This proves my judgment is right.

18:54.440 --> 18:55.519
But maybe someone

18:56.079 --> 18:58.079
maybe someone took it earlier

19:19.839 --> 19:20.640
chief Chen

19:21.400 --> 19:22.000
sit down

19:23.400 --> 19:24.240
second Blade.

19:24.680 --> 19:26.200
Seeing me back,

19:26.200 --> 19:26.960
right?

19:27.240 --> 19:28.519
How would I dare to be disappointed?

19:28.519 --> 19:29.920
I was so scared.

19:31.240 --> 19:31.880
No, I didn't mean that.

19:32.079 --> 19:33.519
We were surprised and happy

19:35.799 --> 19:36.839
you also saw the ending

19:36.839 --> 19:38.319
and Chen Dugu.

19:40.039 --> 19:40.920
I've seen it.

19:41.839 --> 19:43.440
Thanks to your wife, she alerted me.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.680
You didn't forget the task

19:46.000 --> 19:46.720
I gave you, right?

19:47.160 --> 19:48.400
I wouldn't dare to forget it.

19:49.279 --> 19:51.160
I've been following Dazhao

19:51.519 --> 19:52.400
any findings?

19:54.000 --> 19:56.039
Tai Scoop has been acting abnormal recently.

19:57.240 --> 19:59.599
He seems to be secretly contacting someone.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.279
But he was afraid to expose his whereabouts.

20:01.559 --> 20:02.559
He changes a different phone booth

20:02.559 --> 20:03.640
every time he calls.

20:04.400 --> 20:05.200
That's it?

20:05.200 --> 20:06.359
I haven't finished.

20:06.759 --> 20:07.920
Big Scoop knows me.

20:07.920 --> 20:09.119
I didn't dare to get too close to him.

20:09.440 --> 20:10.400
Later on,

20:10.400 --> 20:11.880
I paid off a beggar.

20:12.240 --> 20:14.839
To approach him when he made the call.

20:14.839 --> 20:16.279
According to the beggar,

20:16.279 --> 20:18.640
he was negotiating with the man on the phone about a price.

20:19.160 --> 20:21.400
He said he wanted 500 little yellow croakers

20:21.400 --> 20:22.759
no one is missing.

20:23.559 --> 20:24.960
Five hundred little yellow fishes?

20:26.240 --> 20:28.279
That means 30 jin of gold!

20:28.599 --> 20:29.519
That's right.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.720
I didn't know these treasures

20:33.119 --> 20:34.240
could be sold for so much.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.799
Who's on the end of the phone?

20:36.799 --> 20:37.480
Do you know

20:37.920 --> 20:38.759
I don't know.

20:41.119 --> 20:41.799
That's it?

20:42.880 --> 20:45.200
She even went to the camera shop.

20:46.200 --> 20:46.839
What?

20:47.119 --> 20:48.839
He bought a developing tank and fixing powder.

20:49.960 --> 20:51.480
Are you going to develop photos?

20:51.799 --> 20:52.599
Exactly.

20:52.799 --> 20:54.200
He even put the developed photos in an envelope

20:54.200 --> 20:55.599
the photos in an envelope.

20:58.880 --> 20:59.640
Who was it addressed to?

21:00.480 --> 21:01.039
That's right.

21:02.960 --> 21:04.200
I remade the envelope.

21:04.400 --> 21:05.119
Look at this.

21:08.119 --> 21:09.119
That's great.

21:09.880 --> 21:11.440
How did you get this letter?

21:12.279 --> 21:14.119
That day, I followed Dashao

21:14.119 --> 21:16.279
I saw him putting a letter in the mailbox

21:16.279 --> 21:17.160
In An De Road.

21:17.160 --> 21:18.839
It was 8 in the morning

21:18.839 --> 21:19.680
I know the postman

21:19.680 --> 21:21.480
to pick up the mail at 9: 00 a.m.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.599
I used the one hour between that

21:23.599 --> 21:25.480
of the mailbox with this one hour

21:25.960 --> 21:27.519
and found the letter in no time

21:29.640 --> 21:30.400
oh yeah

21:31.160 --> 21:33.480
besides the envelope, I also recreated the photo.

21:34.759 --> 21:36.359
I mean, where are you?

21:36.359 --> 21:37.599
You can't just take them out all at once.

21:37.920 --> 21:39.480
I don't want to give you

21:39.480 --> 21:40.599
so frightened, right?

21:40.599 --> 21:41.200
Well,

21:41.200 --> 21:42.839
both surprise and joy.

21:45.599 --> 21:46.839
What deal?

21:46.839 --> 21:48.119
I'll tell you when.

21:48.920 --> 21:49.720
But you have to remember

21:49.720 --> 21:51.559
what I told you in the car.

21:51.960 --> 21:53.720
The Japanese are unreliable now.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.519
We have to think about our own future.

21:57.559 --> 21:58.119
Alright.

22:00.200 --> 22:01.720
When you opened the envelope,

22:02.240 --> 22:03.200
when you opened the envelope, right?

22:03.400 --> 22:04.359
No, it's not.

22:04.720 --> 22:05.640
On the seal,

22:05.640 --> 22:08.240
was opened after being exposed to steam.

22:08.240 --> 22:09.519
So it left no trace behind

22:10.839 --> 22:11.640
chief Chen

22:12.400 --> 22:14.480
I decided to be a good person

22:14.839 --> 22:16.920
I'm still not used to it.

22:16.920 --> 22:18.279
I don't have much experience.

22:18.279 --> 22:20.000
I need your advice.

22:21.200 --> 22:22.039
The second one.

22:22.440 --> 22:24.279
The way you pretended to me

22:24.279 --> 22:26.240
with your two pedicure blades.

22:26.240 --> 22:27.599
How he performed in front of me.

22:28.200 --> 22:29.119
I never thought

22:29.119 --> 22:30.079
and become a good man again?

22:31.599 --> 22:32.440
That's right.

22:33.200 --> 22:35.359
When I first came into the underworld,

22:35.359 --> 22:37.559
I always think the world is so dangerous.

22:37.880 --> 22:39.200
One must refrain from evil deeds

22:39.200 --> 22:40.559
only by doing the most evil.

22:41.680 --> 22:44.200
But now she's a good person.

22:58.039 --> 22:58.839
Come in.

23:09.200 --> 23:10.119
Officer Uchida.

23:11.680 --> 23:12.880
You are Qian Chengyi's

23:13.160 --> 23:13.799
yes

23:14.079 --> 23:16.480
but everyone calls me Qian Xiucai.

23:16.480 --> 23:18.079
You wrote the exposure letter?

23:18.079 --> 23:21.079
Saying that Zhao An was actually killed by Luo Guanqun.

23:21.519 --> 23:22.279
Yes

23:23.319 --> 23:26.279
although there is no direct evidence,

23:26.279 --> 23:29.079
but I think it's a reasonable inference.

23:31.079 --> 23:32.279
How long have you been in the reception office?

23:32.279 --> 23:33.200
More than two years.

23:33.799 --> 23:34.759
What exactly are you going to do?

23:34.759 --> 23:36.519
Receiving and distributing newspapers and letters.

23:39.839 --> 23:40.880
Look at this.

23:41.359 --> 23:43.000
Tell me if you remember anything.

23:48.400 --> 23:50.240
Check the postmark.

23:50.759 --> 23:53.640
The sender's address should be around An De Road.

23:55.279 --> 23:56.519
It could be anyone.

23:56.519 --> 23:58.160
To post a letter around An De Road.

23:58.559 --> 23:59.880
What does it mean?

24:01.079 --> 24:02.240
You're right.

24:02.240 --> 24:03.160
You're right.

24:08.200 --> 24:08.960
Officer.

24:08.960 --> 24:10.480
Can I turn on the lamp?

24:10.480 --> 24:11.079
On

24:24.160 --> 24:25.319
this letter...

24:26.279 --> 24:27.400
Is probably

24:27.960 --> 24:30.839
from our firm.

24:30.839 --> 24:31.759
And mailed them.

24:35.960 --> 24:37.079
Why did you say that?

24:38.799 --> 24:42.240
The envelope is made of cowhide paper.

24:42.559 --> 24:44.559
The paper won't seep easily

24:44.559 --> 24:45.400
good tenacity

24:45.400 --> 24:47.440
It is the first choice for making the envelope.

24:47.720 --> 24:50.359
But there is a shortage of supplies these years.

24:50.359 --> 24:52.400
Now the available envelopes

24:52.400 --> 24:55.200
have been replaced by cheap kraft paper.

24:55.200 --> 24:58.039
Those who continue to use cored paper envelopes

24:58.039 --> 25:00.400
are the departments and agencies

25:00.400 --> 25:01.799
that are working for the new government.

25:01.799 --> 25:04.039
It is said that this kind of paper

25:04.759 --> 25:07.200
will not see through light.

25:07.200 --> 25:08.440
And it is a strong secret

25:08.759 --> 25:10.319
as for An De Road,

25:10.319 --> 25:12.920
that work for the new government

25:12.920 --> 25:14.839
only Taihe Business Firm

25:16.359 --> 25:17.799
It seems I got the right person.

25:19.240 --> 25:20.359
Please check the envelope.

25:22.400 --> 25:23.240
Sir,

25:23.240 --> 25:24.359
this is confidential.

25:24.359 --> 25:26.400
It's inappropriate with my position.

25:27.319 --> 25:28.240
I think it's suitable.

25:29.480 --> 25:30.720
Yes

26:03.039 --> 26:04.480
this movie is very boring,

26:05.160 --> 26:06.759
I suggest you not watch it.

26:14.519 --> 26:16.240
I'm going to marry Yamashita Takeru.

26:24.880 --> 26:26.640
Do you look down on me?

26:30.440 --> 26:31.519
I wanted to escape.

26:31.880 --> 26:32.839
And I wanted to die.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.400
But then I decided to stay.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.480
Jiang Zhaoguo wanted me to stay here.

26:43.960 --> 26:45.920
But in the end, I've made this choice

26:47.000 --> 26:48.279
just for him.

26:50.200 --> 26:51.279
Then for what?

26:53.880 --> 26:54.920
I don't know either

26:56.400 --> 26:58.480
I have sacrificed everything for him.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
My body

27:02.920 --> 27:03.920
and my soul.

27:05.680 --> 27:06.799
And my dignity.

27:08.200 --> 27:09.400
I did everything

27:12.200 --> 27:13.640
but I felt that I was wrong

27:15.920 --> 27:16.920
totally wrong.

27:24.240 --> 27:25.880
Can I do something about it?

27:27.839 --> 27:28.680
What?

27:32.000 --> 27:33.839
I know I don't know you well.

27:34.359 --> 27:35.680
But my intuition tells me that

27:36.279 --> 27:37.680
you are not like them.

27:38.200 --> 27:39.880
I won't inquire about your identity.

27:40.400 --> 27:41.799
I just wanted to believe you.

27:42.720 --> 27:43.839
So I think

27:44.160 --> 27:45.440
If you can let me do something.

27:46.599 --> 27:48.279
For a worthy reason,

27:48.759 --> 27:50.079
a noble faith.

27:50.599 --> 27:52.160
In order to make my life

27:52.480 --> 27:53.880
to regain value,

27:57.039 --> 27:57.920
then...

27:58.839 --> 27:59.920
What do you want to do?

28:03.440 --> 28:04.519
Right now,

28:05.359 --> 28:07.200
who can get close to the warrior.

28:08.759 --> 28:10.720
He never told me his secrets.

28:11.720 --> 28:13.359
But I know he is very powerful

28:14.359 --> 28:16.240
and is planning something evil.

28:18.599 --> 28:19.799
Aren't you afraid of danger?

28:20.240 --> 28:21.039
Not really.

28:22.839 --> 28:24.000
Don't you fear that

28:25.400 --> 28:27.319
you'll lose the reputation

28:28.359 --> 28:29.160
or status,

28:30.599 --> 28:31.359
a halo?

28:33.559 --> 28:34.400
Don't be.

28:35.640 --> 28:36.680
I'm not afraid of death.

28:40.440 --> 28:42.559
But I'm afraid of dying meaninglessly.

28:55.920 --> 28:57.240
Why are you back so late?

28:58.839 --> 29:00.079
Your superior replied to you.

29:01.160 --> 29:02.279
The application

29:02.599 --> 29:04.480
I've submitted it to your organization.

29:05.400 --> 29:06.839
I can join your organization now.

29:07.880 --> 29:08.839
Don't be anxious.

29:08.839 --> 29:09.880
Get me a glass of water.

29:14.240 --> 29:15.240
The superior

29:15.240 --> 29:16.400
asked me to investigate you

29:16.400 --> 29:18.200
Investigate you for a while.

29:19.559 --> 29:21.720
You didn't get approved.

29:22.640 --> 29:24.440
Inspection doesn't mean you haven't approved.

29:24.839 --> 29:27.440
This is a serious and serious matter.

29:28.119 --> 29:29.960
It's not all about your own will.

29:31.079 --> 29:31.799
However,

29:32.880 --> 29:34.240
the organization has agreed

29:34.240 --> 29:36.079
to assist me with work.

29:36.680 --> 29:38.440
So I can help you.

29:40.200 --> 29:41.000
To support you?

29:46.480 --> 29:47.480
Luo Guanqun asked me

29:48.160 --> 29:49.759
he asked me to see him tomorrow morning.

29:50.640 --> 29:52.079
There must be something very important.

29:53.640 --> 29:55.160
He asked you to rest for a while.

29:55.680 --> 29:59.079
That means he needs me to the time.

30:00.799 --> 30:01.680
I'm thinking

30:02.440 --> 30:03.960
that he has got

30:03.960 --> 30:06.079
the formula in Magpie's hands?

30:08.880 --> 30:09.880
I didn't expect that

30:10.799 --> 30:12.079
jun Tong had a fight

30:12.079 --> 30:14.039
for the magpie for a while.

30:15.680 --> 30:17.400
Finally, they got caught behind.

30:17.599 --> 30:18.599
Luckily,

30:18.599 --> 30:21.720
luo Guanqun is just trying to get some leverage.

30:22.119 --> 30:23.720
In this way, we'll get our chance.

30:24.680 --> 30:25.640
What is your plan?

30:28.000 --> 30:29.079
Let me check first.

30:29.400 --> 30:31.440
How Luo Guanqun dealt with Yamashita, right?

30:31.440 --> 30:32.599
And then choose the right opportunity.

30:33.799 --> 30:35.440
I want to take part in the operation.

30:39.440 --> 30:40.559
According to your organization,

30:40.559 --> 30:41.960
I can help you.

30:43.960 --> 30:44.640
Alright.

30:45.200 --> 30:46.839
You finish reading those books first.

30:54.599 --> 30:55.559
Why do you read these?

30:58.079 --> 30:58.799
Actually, I was thinking that

30:58.799 --> 31:01.039
If Luo Guanqun might think this simple.

31:01.720 --> 31:03.400
He wrote an anonymous letter

31:03.640 --> 31:04.920
and made an anonymous phone call.

31:04.920 --> 31:07.319
And even bargain with her.

31:08.039 --> 31:10.559
I don't believe that there is no strategy

31:12.599 --> 31:14.079
you are worried about exposing it.

31:14.720 --> 31:16.559
If it is exposed,

31:16.960 --> 31:18.880
luo Guanqun and I will be screwed.

31:19.319 --> 31:20.640
But I still can't understand

31:22.240 --> 31:23.720
what it has to do with reading these books.

31:25.480 --> 31:26.359
Tomorrow afternoon,

31:26.519 --> 31:28.519
tomorrow afternoon

31:28.519 --> 31:30.000
to buy clothes for the wedding.

31:31.119 --> 31:32.640
You'll go with Han Lu.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.039
Found a place.

31:38.039 --> 31:39.079
In the Gu House.

31:39.079 --> 31:40.920
A three-story Shikumen house.

31:40.920 --> 31:41.839
It's secluded.

31:41.839 --> 31:43.000
The line of sight is fine.

31:43.400 --> 31:44.799
Which is very convenient for us to monitor.

31:45.359 --> 31:46.039
One more thing.

31:46.039 --> 31:48.279
I also connected a phone line

31:48.279 --> 31:49.400
to get there directly.

31:49.920 --> 31:50.960
The phone company.

31:50.960 --> 31:52.359
We'll never find that location.

31:55.839 --> 31:57.039
Take me there directly.

31:57.039 --> 31:58.000
All right.

32:07.960 --> 32:09.279
Manager Luo didn't come?

32:09.799 --> 32:10.920
It's none of your business.

32:11.160 --> 32:11.880
Yes, that's right.

32:12.119 --> 32:13.319
It's Mr. Luo's paper?

32:23.920 --> 32:24.880
Section Chief Chen

32:25.119 --> 32:26.240
are you here for work?

32:26.920 --> 32:27.559
Right.

32:28.799 --> 32:30.960
So many things happened in the firm recently.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.480
I'm so glad to have you back.

32:34.680 --> 32:35.400
Right.

32:35.960 --> 32:37.279
We have fewer and fewer

32:37.279 --> 32:39.240
In our business.

32:39.799 --> 32:40.599
That's right

32:41.000 --> 32:41.839
chief Chen

32:42.319 --> 32:43.759
I've heard what happened to you

32:44.079 --> 32:46.160
It's really remarkable that

32:46.160 --> 32:47.200
you're really amazing.

32:48.240 --> 32:50.240
Why didn't you read your Chronicles of the States of Eastern Zhou?

32:51.480 --> 32:52.440
I've finished.

32:52.440 --> 32:53.279
Finished.

32:53.759 --> 32:55.960
I thought you would watch it over and over again.

32:57.279 --> 32:58.160
You don't need to read it over and over again

32:58.160 --> 32:59.559
you don't have to read it over and over again?

33:05.039 --> 33:05.680
Chief Chen

33:10.160 --> 33:10.920
he's here

33:11.599 --> 33:11.960
where is Luo?

33:11.960 --> 33:12.839
He's waiting for you.

33:13.240 --> 33:14.000
Where is he?

33:14.799 --> 33:15.519
He's not here.

33:15.519 --> 33:16.839
Let me take you there.

33:18.799 --> 33:19.400
Alright.

33:19.880 --> 33:20.720
Drive the car.

33:21.079 --> 33:21.680
No, I won't.

33:21.680 --> 33:22.319
Don't drive.

33:22.319 --> 33:23.119
Manager Luo said that

33:23.119 --> 33:24.599
driving in and out.

33:24.599 --> 33:25.519
Caught too much attention.

33:25.519 --> 33:26.720
Let's walk there.

33:26.720 --> 33:27.400
Alright.

34:03.720 --> 34:05.160
Who will that be?

34:08.360 --> 34:08.960
This place.

34:09.400 --> 34:11.039
Why did Luo meet me here?

34:12.320 --> 34:13.440
We'll find out after we enter.

34:27.159 --> 34:28.159
Is he in the room?

34:28.159 --> 34:29.239
Yes, he's waiting for you.

34:36.679 --> 34:37.559
Brother,

34:37.559 --> 34:39.119
what a shabby place this is!

34:41.960 --> 34:44.000
This is my command center.

34:44.280 --> 34:45.280
Knock it off.

34:45.280 --> 34:46.760
You don't have to command so shabby.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.280
Someone offered me a lot of money

34:50.920 --> 34:52.880
to buy the thing I have

34:54.280 --> 34:55.079
what's that

34:57.360 --> 34:59.440
the formula of coin paper

35:01.199 --> 35:02.880
the formula of coin paper

35:04.280 --> 35:05.719
I heard about it.

35:06.599 --> 35:08.320
Why do you have it?

35:11.920 --> 35:13.280
We are the only ones

35:13.280 --> 35:14.880
only you and I,

35:15.800 --> 35:16.480
big spoon.

35:16.480 --> 35:17.400
The three of us know it.

35:18.079 --> 35:19.320
If the deal goes down,

35:19.320 --> 35:21.119
our heads

35:21.599 --> 35:22.639
land on the ground together.

35:29.119 --> 35:30.079
Brother,

35:30.559 --> 35:32.559
we've done so much business.

35:32.559 --> 35:34.719
Why do we have to be killed this time?

35:36.079 --> 35:38.000
Do you know who you made deals with this time?

35:38.000 --> 35:38.719
Who?

35:39.760 --> 35:40.880
Martial arts master under the mountain.

35:46.719 --> 35:48.199
Martial Master of the Mountain.

35:48.679 --> 35:49.559
Scared?

36:01.639 --> 36:02.480
Chief Chen

36:02.760 --> 36:04.199
you can't leave?

36:04.559 --> 36:06.320
You've already known too much.

36:07.840 --> 36:08.480
Come here.

36:08.480 --> 36:09.440
Have a seat

36:09.440 --> 36:10.239
chief Chen

36:10.599 --> 36:11.440
have a seat

36:11.440 --> 36:12.960
and let Manager Luo finish.

36:13.679 --> 36:14.760
Well, brother.

36:15.440 --> 36:17.400
I'm just a pawn on the stage.

36:17.400 --> 36:20.079
I can't sing in this play.

36:23.320 --> 36:24.960
Stop that

36:26.199 --> 36:28.800
you managed to escape from the detention center of the Military Police Headquarters.

36:28.800 --> 36:30.199
You should do this.

36:33.800 --> 36:35.159
Ten big yellow croaker,

36:36.800 --> 36:37.719
ten fishes?

36:39.800 --> 36:40.960
Or yellow croaker?

36:43.920 --> 36:44.880
I can't do that either.

36:44.880 --> 36:45.760
My life is ruined.

36:45.760 --> 36:47.400
What's the use of money?

36:47.719 --> 36:48.679
You know what?

36:48.960 --> 36:51.119
As long as you use your wits,

36:51.119 --> 36:52.880
you'll be able to do it.

36:56.360 --> 36:57.559
Then brother,

36:57.559 --> 36:58.960
what do you want me to do?

37:00.239 --> 37:01.199
You know

37:02.199 --> 37:03.920
about the current situation?

37:04.480 --> 37:05.719
In the future,

37:06.599 --> 37:08.159
more and more miserable.

37:10.400 --> 37:11.679
You don't want to

37:11.679 --> 37:13.559
end up in a corner?

37:14.519 --> 37:15.360
I don't want to.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.639
The Japanese are not reliable anymore.

37:20.320 --> 37:21.280
What do you mean?

37:22.280 --> 37:24.440
Can I rely on money?

37:26.039 --> 37:27.199
Money every day.

37:27.199 --> 37:30.119
Soon the money will become a pile of waste paper.

37:31.480 --> 37:32.360
Gold

37:32.960 --> 37:35.400
you can only count on holding gold.

37:35.719 --> 37:37.119
Aren't you afraid of the Japanese collapsing?

37:37.119 --> 37:38.079
Aren't you scared?

37:39.039 --> 37:41.239
The Communists are back against us. Are you scared?

37:41.239 --> 37:42.079
Aren't you scared?

37:42.079 --> 37:43.639
Aren't you scared that the National Army is back?

37:43.639 --> 37:44.960
Or not?

37:47.000 --> 37:49.440
Let the moon shine on the lakes.

37:49.440 --> 37:50.719
Don't be afraid that you can catch the golden hook anywhere.

37:50.719 --> 37:50.960
Enough!

37:50.960 --> 37:52.320
Brother. Brother. Brother. Brother.

37:52.920 --> 37:54.599
Stop reciting your stupid poem.

37:55.599 --> 37:57.280
What the hell do you want me to do?

38:38.320 --> 38:39.280
My good friend.

38:41.440 --> 38:42.599
These words

38:44.199 --> 38:46.199
are from "Liang You."

38:46.480 --> 38:47.840
Then this person

38:48.880 --> 38:51.920
he will be one of those who subscribed to Good Friend.

39:01.079 --> 39:03.239
How is the investigation going?

39:04.159 --> 39:05.159
No news yet.

39:11.639 --> 39:13.519
What's the name of the person

39:13.880 --> 39:14.679
you mentioned before?

39:15.599 --> 39:16.599
Is Qian Chengyi

39:17.679 --> 39:18.880
are you sure that

39:19.280 --> 39:20.599
he'll be able to find out the truth?

39:21.079 --> 39:23.199
If he is in Taihe Trading Firm,

39:23.239 --> 39:25.559
he knows that everyone there

39:26.840 --> 39:28.960
you have to believe that some people will stop at nothing

39:28.960 --> 39:30.719
to go upwards.

39:33.840 --> 39:35.960
I'm going to prepare the kimono

39:36.559 --> 39:39.199
to prepare the kimono for the wedding.

39:39.400 --> 39:40.679
Once we have something,

39:40.960 --> 39:44.679
call Juchuan Riqiao Shop immediately.

39:44.960 --> 39:45.480
Yes

39:54.599 --> 39:55.559
mr Yamashita

39:55.960 --> 39:57.760
has brought Miss Han Lu here.

39:57.760 --> 40:00.119
She's waiting for you outside.

40:04.719 --> 40:07.159
I shouldn't have let such a beautiful lady

40:07.159 --> 40:08.519
I should have done it.

40:12.920 --> 40:14.000
Mr. Yamashita,

40:15.639 --> 40:16.400
what's the matter?

40:18.079 --> 40:20.800
That man called again.

40:20.800 --> 40:22.719
He wants to make a deal today.

40:23.119 --> 40:23.960
Time and place

40:23.960 --> 40:25.119
how to conduct the transaction?

40:25.280 --> 40:26.800
There is a public phone booth beside Pacific Music Store

40:26.800 --> 40:28.320
near Pacific Music Store on Waima Road

40:28.960 --> 40:30.719
he asked you to go there alone.

40:30.719 --> 40:32.760
Wait for him to call you there at 3 p.m.

40:33.239 --> 40:34.440
You are going alone.

40:34.440 --> 40:35.239
That's too dangerous.

40:35.800 --> 40:36.960
He also said

40:36.960 --> 40:38.519
he will be watching nearby.

40:38.519 --> 40:40.280
Once you find someone is with you,

40:40.840 --> 40:42.000
cancel the deal.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.239
I will arrange good people in advance

40:43.239 --> 40:44.719
around the phone booth

40:44.960 --> 40:46.480
tell them to never hide

40:46.480 --> 40:47.519
and don't be discovered.

40:47.760 --> 40:48.440
Yes

40:49.440 --> 40:50.480
however,

40:50.880 --> 40:52.519
according to my judgment,

40:53.159 --> 40:55.320
the real exchange place

40:55.320 --> 40:57.079
wasn't that phone booth

40:57.199 --> 40:59.679
he still changes his address.

41:00.519 --> 41:02.079
I'll pretend to follow him

41:02.079 --> 41:04.679
to protect you.

41:04.679 --> 41:06.440
Catch the blackmailer at the same time.

41:06.719 --> 41:07.320
Remember that

41:08.039 --> 41:09.480
the formula is the most important,

41:09.559 --> 41:11.719
the most important part is catching him.

41:12.000 --> 41:12.679
Yes

41:14.440 --> 41:16.760
put the gold in the car.

41:17.719 --> 41:18.199
Yes

41:25.559 --> 41:26.360
what about

41:26.760 --> 41:28.440
my beautiful Miss Han Lu.

41:28.440 --> 41:30.320
Have you found your favorite style?

41:31.159 --> 41:32.719
Your eyes are blind.

41:32.719 --> 41:33.800
I must go to the store

41:33.800 --> 41:35.440
and try it on in person.

41:38.480 --> 41:39.519
I'm very sorry.

41:39.519 --> 41:40.639
Something came up.

41:40.639 --> 41:41.519
I won't accompany you now.

41:42.119 --> 41:43.480
But don't worry.

41:43.480 --> 41:44.559
As soon as I'm done,

41:44.559 --> 41:45.840
I'll come and keep you company.

41:48.239 --> 41:48.880
Alright.

41:49.119 --> 41:50.519
Luckily, I have an appointment with Zuo Shuangtao.

41:50.519 --> 41:52.159
I won't be alone anymore.

41:52.440 --> 41:53.559
Left Shuangtao.

41:54.760 --> 41:56.480
From Taihe Trading Firm?

41:56.800 --> 41:57.320
Right.

41:57.639 --> 41:59.800
Her husband Chen Jiaping is my good friend.

41:59.800 --> 42:01.920
She knows Japanese kimono culture very well.

42:01.920 --> 42:03.360
She can give me advice.

42:04.719 --> 42:07.239
That you are willing to wear a kimono

42:08.039 --> 42:08.800
I'm really

42:09.360 --> 42:10.480
I'm very pleased.

42:36.360 --> 42:37.679
There're too many people.

42:37.679 --> 42:39.719
We can't investigate one by one

42:44.719 --> 42:45.679
mr. Yamashita,

42:45.679 --> 42:46.840
the outer road is ahead.

43:45.559 --> 43:46.159
Hello?

43:46.360 --> 43:47.280
This is Underhill.

43:47.519 --> 43:49.719
Five minutes from now,

43:50.119 --> 43:52.000
there is a phone booth

43:52.000 --> 43:52.880
telephone booth.

43:53.639 --> 43:54.719
If you are late,

43:55.280 --> 43:56.400
the deal is off.
