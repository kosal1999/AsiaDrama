02:20.240 --> 02:20.840
Hey!

02:21.240 --> 02:21.840
How are you?

02:22.879 --> 02:23.879
I'm okay, just calm down.

02:25.599 --> 02:25.960
Good.

02:26.479 --> 02:27.039
The address you mean

02:27.039 --> 02:27.680
I'll note it first.

02:34.120 --> 02:34.599
Good.

02:35.360 --> 02:36.080
I already know.

02:36.080 --> 02:36.840
Until found.

03:04.599 --> 03:07.000
Did Jiang Zhaoguo call just now?

03:12.439 --> 03:13.400
Above this

03:13.680 --> 03:15.680
what is the address of Zhao country?

04:14.759 --> 04:17.759
This number is 45A3-8

04:18.199 --> 04:19.720
collected from military commanders.

04:20.319 --> 04:22.319
Due to the habits of previous report senders

04:22.319 --> 04:23.720
causes wear on the power cable

04:24.199 --> 04:26.160
so the examiner can see these characteristics

04:26.160 --> 04:27.199
differentiate this message.

04:27.199 --> 04:28.040
Send from

04:28.040 --> 04:29.480
45a3-8.

04:57.639 --> 04:58.759
Owned by Han Lu.

04:58.839 --> 04:59.800
Didn't think so, did you?

05:00.519 --> 05:01.600
We meet again.

05:02.639 --> 05:04.319
Why smoke so much?

05:05.000 --> 05:05.920
Flustered?

05:07.399 --> 05:08.120
Why?

05:09.000 --> 05:10.120
Smoking is also not allowed?

05:11.399 --> 05:12.720
On what basis did you arrest me?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.879
You are the one who conspired with the Chongqing government,

05:16.319 --> 05:17.920
why didn't I catch you?

05:18.160 --> 05:19.800
Saying I colluded with the Chongqing government.

05:20.399 --> 05:21.519
Do you have any evidence?

05:21.519 --> 05:23.079
Jiang Zhaoguo itu siapamu?

05:23.319 --> 05:24.519
We used to be friends

05:25.040 --> 05:26.720
but haven't seen each other for a long time

05:27.639 --> 05:28.680
is this also wrong?

05:28.680 --> 05:30.240
We got the right information.

05:31.079 --> 05:33.639
Jiang Zhaoguo baru tiba di Shanghai.

05:33.639 --> 05:34.759
To look for you.

05:35.600 --> 05:36.040
No.

05:36.439 --> 05:37.319
You help him rent a house.

05:37.319 --> 05:38.800
You said he never looked for you?

05:40.839 --> 05:43.199
Does renting a house mean he's ever looking for me?

05:43.519 --> 05:44.519
Still don't want to admit it.

05:45.240 --> 05:48.079
You are much more cunning than we imagine.

05:48.399 --> 05:50.680
You know we follow you,

05:51.360 --> 05:53.319
so you don't let Jiang Zhaoguo

05:53.319 --> 05:54.800
come to your rental house

05:55.920 --> 05:57.160
and for the sake of annoying

05:57.160 --> 05:58.319
and misled our investigation

05:59.120 --> 06:01.199
looking for someone to impersonate Jiang Zhaoguo.

06:01.839 --> 06:04.079
You're still pretending you're making preparations for negotiations

06:04.519 --> 06:05.120
right, right?

06:08.240 --> 06:09.920
But you didn't expect that, did you?

06:10.800 --> 06:11.920
Our people...

06:12.879 --> 06:14.560
Brought home the original photo of Jiang Zhaoguo

06:15.639 --> 06:18.600
membawa foto asli Jiang Zhaoguo.

06:23.879 --> 06:25.160
All this you said

06:25.879 --> 06:27.519
just your guess.

06:31.199 --> 06:31.879
Guess?

06:33.600 --> 06:34.920
You see this.

06:38.399 --> 06:39.279
Not strange, right?

06:40.399 --> 06:42.720
You wrote it, right? Fuxu Road.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.279
Menurutku, Jiang Zhaoguo...

06:45.279 --> 06:46.920
It should be in this place now

06:48.079 --> 06:48.839
what's the back?

06:48.839 --> 06:49.839
There isn't any.

06:51.199 --> 06:52.399
What's the back?

06:58.600 --> 06:59.319
The specific address,

06:59.319 --> 06:59.800
say

07:05.240 --> 07:06.959
I am a friend of the soldiers at the foot of the mountain.

07:08.519 --> 07:09.600
You are like that to me,

07:10.639 --> 07:11.519
you will definitely regret it.

07:17.839 --> 07:19.680
Still going to practice martial arts?

07:20.199 --> 07:22.199
A fighter at the foot of the mountain was dead.

07:22.360 --> 07:23.600
Even if he is still alive,

07:23.600 --> 07:24.800
can't help you either.

07:26.079 --> 07:26.839
Say it or not?

07:29.000 --> 07:30.079
It's okay not to say it.

07:30.279 --> 07:32.079
Fuxu Street only had so many buildings.

07:32.920 --> 07:33.639
Feng Qi.

07:34.360 --> 07:35.720
Look for places one by one,

07:36.079 --> 07:38.279
sampai menemukan Jiang Zhaoguo.

07:38.480 --> 07:40.720
OK, I'll do it now.

07:46.399 --> 07:47.639
You protect the country of Zhao.

07:47.639 --> 07:48.959
Do you think it's appropriate?

07:49.800 --> 07:51.839
Do you think he will protect you?

07:53.199 --> 07:55.720
We have a way to make him talk,

07:56.199 --> 07:57.759
and tell him to comment on you.

07:58.079 --> 07:59.319
Once proven

08:00.040 --> 08:02.399
Your crime is conspiring with the Chongqing government.

08:05.040 --> 08:07.079
I'll cut...

08:08.319 --> 08:11.120
To cut your pretty face.

08:15.759 --> 08:16.879
So beautiful.

09:07.240 --> 09:07.840
Nona Zuo.

09:07.840 --> 09:09.039
It's okay, he passed out.

09:09.720 --> 09:10.320
Nona Zuo.

09:10.519 --> 09:11.480
Have you received a telegram from me?

09:11.480 --> 09:11.799
Correct.

09:12.080 --> 09:12.960
I'll be there soon.

09:14.320 --> 09:15.200
What's wrong with you, Miss Zuo?

09:15.200 --> 09:16.200
Help me break the iron chains.

09:16.279 --> 09:16.720
Good.

09:17.840 --> 09:19.639
Look on the deck for a hammer or something.

09:25.759 --> 09:26.600
Bai Qian.

09:28.279 --> 09:29.120
where is he

09:29.559 --> 09:30.240
Bai Qian.

09:31.480 --> 09:32.759
Bai Qian, bangun.

09:34.720 --> 09:35.879
What is this?

09:35.879 --> 09:37.399
Looks like he fell asleep.

09:38.080 --> 09:38.960
Fall asleep.

09:40.559 --> 09:41.679
The ship is about to sail.

09:41.679 --> 09:42.279
What sleep?

09:42.360 --> 09:43.320
here, wake up, here.

09:43.799 --> 09:44.639
Don't sleep anymore, Bai Qian.

09:45.799 --> 09:46.360
Do not move.

09:51.399 --> 09:52.159
Place high.

09:55.159 --> 09:56.600
The left peach continues to use you.

09:56.600 --> 09:57.799
Didn't you realize that?

09:58.559 --> 09:59.320
What does it have to do with you

09:59.320 --> 10:00.080
I do.

10:01.480 --> 10:02.600
Stupid!

10:04.399 --> 10:06.240
Do you know what you are doing?

10:06.240 --> 10:07.039
Of course I know.

10:07.600 --> 10:08.440
Give me the key.

10:10.480 --> 10:11.639
Give him the key.

10:18.200 --> 10:18.679
Good

10:31.360 --> 10:33.080
You are destroying your future.

10:33.600 --> 10:34.879
Maybe my future

10:35.440 --> 10:36.679
contrary to you.

10:38.279 --> 10:39.000
Defeat

10:41.120 --> 10:41.960
go quickly

11:04.600 --> 11:06.200
then when did you realize he was missing?

11:06.840 --> 11:07.960
About

11:07.960 --> 11:09.080
around 10 o'clock

11:09.480 --> 11:10.679
Today the weather is cold.

11:10.679 --> 11:11.600
I went to knock on the door

11:11.799 --> 11:14.080
Want to ask whether it is necessary to use a mattress and blanket.

11:14.639 --> 11:16.200
Knocking for so long also no answer.

11:16.720 --> 11:17.879
I opened the door,

11:18.039 --> 11:19.360
and realized there was no one there.

11:19.879 --> 11:20.679
Good, go.

11:20.679 --> 11:21.080
Thank You.

11:25.080 --> 11:25.919
Go to his house to have a look.

11:26.240 --> 11:26.720
Road.

11:51.480 --> 11:52.720
Unexpectedly they use this kind of method

11:52.720 --> 11:53.759
treat their people

11:54.480 --> 11:56.639
changes really fast.

12:04.919 --> 12:06.639
After experiencing these two days' things,

12:08.120 --> 12:09.039
makes me feel

12:09.799 --> 12:11.360
the border between friend and enemy

12:12.159 --> 12:13.639
suddenly became blurry

12:14.919 --> 12:15.799
You say,

12:16.360 --> 12:17.720
before I was your enemy,

12:20.840 --> 12:21.879
now you are friends.

12:22.399 --> 12:23.879
However, if I were your friend,

12:24.799 --> 12:25.600
aren't we both?

12:25.960 --> 12:27.639
no more possibilities?

12:28.879 --> 12:30.240
So for me,

12:31.200 --> 12:32.799
I'm afraid being an enemy would be better.

12:37.440 --> 12:39.080
Previously I underestimated Chen Jia Ping too much.

12:39.440 --> 12:40.639
Last night if it wasn't for him

12:41.200 --> 12:42.200
I will be a sinner.

12:43.279 --> 12:45.360
You clearly don't want to harm me,

12:46.120 --> 12:48.120
but why do you always force me

12:48.120 --> 12:48.840
threatened me

12:50.080 --> 12:51.120
do you know why?

12:55.360 --> 12:56.360
Drink coffee.

12:56.799 --> 12:57.600
A warm body

13:00.000 --> 13:01.799
because Chen Jia Ping had changed the secret letter

13:01.799 --> 13:02.720
then your identity

13:03.200 --> 13:04.559
His identity to you?

13:07.080 --> 13:08.840
He just didn't want Zhao An to find trouble with me.

13:12.919 --> 13:15.360
I think it's your coffee

13:15.879 --> 13:18.480
much tastier than the ones sold at Kedai Kopi

13:18.840 --> 13:19.799
better

13:21.559 --> 13:23.279
then after the war is over,

13:23.279 --> 13:24.840
I just opened a coffee shop

13:26.559 --> 13:27.960
the business must be very good

13:29.559 --> 13:31.000
but open a coffee shop alone

13:31.759 --> 13:32.799
still too lonely

13:37.600 --> 13:38.200
Today

13:38.919 --> 13:40.559
really don't know how to thank you

13:42.159 --> 13:44.279
You previously really wanted to kill me.

13:46.080 --> 13:47.279
Actually, you're not evil.

13:50.879 --> 13:52.919
No, I'm very evil.

13:54.759 --> 13:55.679
I'm selfish.

13:56.039 --> 13:56.759
Lonely.

13:57.279 --> 13:57.919
Paranoia.

13:58.720 --> 14:00.679
Is a person who legalizes all means to achieve his goal.

14:01.080 --> 14:01.879
I feel

14:03.080 --> 14:04.320
you're just immature,

14:05.840 --> 14:07.039
like a grown man.

14:08.639 --> 14:09.480
Don't know

14:09.879 --> 14:11.960
how to get what I want.

14:11.960 --> 14:13.240
That's because I know,

14:14.039 --> 14:15.840
I can't get what I want

14:19.279 --> 14:21.039
that's why I did something bad.

14:29.480 --> 14:29.879
Correct

14:31.679 --> 14:32.919
this transmitter

14:32.919 --> 14:34.279
do you want me to move it back

14:34.960 --> 14:36.480
I want you to help me send a telegram

14:36.960 --> 14:38.080
to your boss

14:38.879 --> 14:40.600
so you have to use a transmitter

14:40.840 --> 14:41.240
Correct

14:41.679 --> 14:42.679
but I don't have a password book.

14:44.279 --> 14:46.799
Inside this box are some messages after transcription

14:46.799 --> 14:48.080
and written text after translation.

14:48.759 --> 14:50.120
Using the cross comparison method

14:50.720 --> 14:51.799
give me one night,

14:51.799 --> 14:52.759
I can do it.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.279
Trust you,

15:24.840 --> 15:26.240
Han Lu should have returned.

15:27.200 --> 15:28.759
Then captured again by Zhao An's people.

15:29.440 --> 15:31.120
Have warned him many times,

15:31.120 --> 15:32.720
why do you still want to come back?

15:39.679 --> 15:41.720
probably waiting for an important call

15:59.919 --> 16:01.759
Already.

16:02.559 --> 16:03.080
Nona Zuo.

16:05.919 --> 16:06.720
Excuse me.

16:06.960 --> 16:07.600
Did I wake you up?

16:07.600 --> 16:08.039
No.

16:08.559 --> 16:09.440
Has it worked?

16:09.440 --> 16:09.840
Correct.

16:10.399 --> 16:11.799
This is a bunch of random ciphers.

16:12.080 --> 16:14.000
Based on a single table,

16:14.000 --> 16:15.399
enter mathematical formulas.

16:15.399 --> 16:16.919
Make different words the same size

16:16.919 --> 16:18.559
achieve the goal of disrupting the opponent's analysis

16:19.080 --> 16:20.200
but, this chaos numbers

16:20.200 --> 16:21.320
not an unlimited number.

16:21.840 --> 16:22.919
Usually

16:22.919 --> 16:24.960
add an old poem instead.

16:25.960 --> 16:26.320
This is for people

16:26.320 --> 16:28.039
who do not master the password pattern,

16:28.279 --> 16:29.480
did have some confusion.

16:30.120 --> 16:31.200
But before,

16:31.200 --> 16:32.879
master the comparison of secret text and clear text.

16:32.879 --> 16:34.159
I found

16:34.159 --> 16:35.080
this rule.

16:35.320 --> 16:37.039
For me, it's resolved.

16:37.679 --> 16:38.840
All this you say,

16:38.960 --> 16:39.919
I do not quite understand.

16:40.799 --> 16:41.720
However, I feel...

16:42.240 --> 16:43.120
You're so great.

16:46.080 --> 16:46.759
Now it's very good

16:48.200 --> 16:49.960
You can now send a report to your superior.

16:52.559 --> 16:53.039
But

16:54.440 --> 16:55.080
I understand.

16:55.720 --> 16:56.440
This is a secret.

16:56.600 --> 16:57.440
I can't be there.

16:58.320 --> 16:59.159
I'm going to work first.

17:00.240 --> 17:01.080
Thank You.

17:02.559 --> 17:03.480
After this,

17:03.960 --> 17:05.160
will still come to do business again, okay?

17:07.839 --> 17:08.359
Very good.

17:08.720 --> 17:09.440
Can still see you.

17:10.279 --> 17:10.680
Go ahead

17:24.880 --> 17:27.039
Are you sure you've looked everywhere

17:27.039 --> 17:29.279
we are some policemen who disguise themselves as concession house custodians

17:29.440 --> 17:30.440
under the pretext of investigating a wanted criminal

17:30.440 --> 17:32.720
already looking everywhere on Fuxu street,

17:32.720 --> 17:34.079
but did not find Jiang Zhaoguo.

17:34.200 --> 17:35.480
Fuxu Road these three words,

17:35.640 --> 17:37.160
Are you sure it was written by Han Lu?

17:37.160 --> 17:37.920
when answering the phone?

17:38.440 --> 17:39.799
Not wrong.

17:41.799 --> 17:42.880
Now I

17:42.880 --> 17:44.720
want to report to the Mu Village Chief.

17:44.920 --> 17:47.160
I think today there can be a breakthrough.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.839
Now go also scolded.

17:50.160 --> 17:51.240
Wait for me to come back,

17:52.599 --> 17:54.440
I'll check this frost.

17:54.440 --> 17:54.880
Good.

17:55.359 --> 17:56.400
Now where is he locked up?

17:56.680 --> 17:57.920
And in the warehouse parking lot behind.

17:58.480 --> 17:59.279
No one will ever know.

18:00.119 --> 18:01.640
After all, Han Lu is a star,

18:01.799 --> 18:02.880
the influence is big.

18:03.319 --> 18:04.480
So that the brothers look after him,

18:04.640 --> 18:05.680
no one can know

18:05.680 --> 18:06.880
he was locked up there.

18:07.559 --> 18:08.160
Understand

18:08.480 --> 18:09.119
stay cool.

18:30.079 --> 18:31.839
Fuxu Road is not Jiang Zhaoguo's country address,

18:32.519 --> 18:33.640
I've said it from the start,

18:34.440 --> 18:35.200
I don't know at all

18:35.200 --> 18:36.480
di mana Jiang Zhaoguo berada.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.839
You guys are carelessly guessing.

18:42.240 --> 18:42.920
What are you doing?

18:42.920 --> 18:43.440
You touch it.

18:43.960 --> 18:44.680
let me go

18:44.680 --> 18:45.519
Have you touched it?

18:45.960 --> 18:47.720
Are there round scars?

18:47.720 --> 18:49.000
You know what that is?

18:52.839 --> 18:54.160
This was shot

18:54.880 --> 18:57.519
on the forehead for five minutes

18:57.920 --> 19:00.279
Only then can a round trace appear this deep.

19:00.960 --> 19:02.920
If I can't find Jiang Zhaoguo,

19:03.680 --> 19:05.480
shot in my forehead

19:05.839 --> 19:07.000
will fire bullets

19:08.160 --> 19:09.599
exploded in my head

19:10.319 --> 19:11.519
put out thoughts

19:14.160 --> 19:16.200
where is the country of Zhao?

19:20.119 --> 19:21.079
I don't know.

19:24.079 --> 19:25.759
Have you forgotten what I said yesterday?

19:27.039 --> 19:29.640
I will cut off your faces one by one

19:30.440 --> 19:32.160
your beautiful face

19:34.200 --> 19:35.000
feng Qi.

19:37.759 --> 19:39.319
I asked one last time.

19:40.200 --> 19:42.039
Di mana Jiang Zhaoguo?

19:44.200 --> 19:45.240
I don't know.

19:45.839 --> 19:46.799
Loud mouth

19:47.759 --> 19:48.519
let go.

19:54.079 --> 19:56.519
This is your last chance.

19:58.079 --> 19:59.200
Really don't want to say?

20:02.680 --> 20:03.799
Grumpy Girl,

20:04.240 --> 20:05.319
bite me!

20:05.720 --> 20:06.119
Grumpy Girl,

20:06.119 --> 20:07.359
I made you unable to act anymore.

20:07.359 --> 20:08.319
Stop it!

20:12.480 --> 20:12.960
Zhao An.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.079
You really have big guts!

20:16.079 --> 20:17.720
You've been brave for a few days,

20:19.200 --> 20:21.319
These are police from the Military Police Headquarters.

20:21.640 --> 20:23.319
Naoki,

20:23.720 --> 20:24.559
good morning sir

20:33.920 --> 20:36.319
Specially came for Miss Han Lu's matter.

20:36.720 --> 20:38.480
When he was dying,

20:38.839 --> 20:39.960
surrender all

20:40.640 --> 20:41.880
it's all on Lord Zhongzuo.

20:44.680 --> 20:45.920
Especially telling me

20:46.480 --> 20:48.319
to take good care of Miss Han Lu.

20:48.799 --> 20:49.400
Good.

20:50.720 --> 20:51.559
Kapten Ueda,

20:52.079 --> 20:53.119
we suspect,

20:53.279 --> 20:54.279
owned by Han Lu,

20:54.640 --> 20:57.279
colluded with Chongqing to represent Jiang Zhaoguo's country.

20:57.720 --> 20:58.680
Do you have any proof?

20:58.680 --> 20:59.119
Ada.

20:59.920 --> 21:01.559
What I said is strong evidence.

21:02.160 --> 21:04.599
You're not the one who always creates fake news.

21:04.599 --> 21:05.680
Of course.

21:08.359 --> 21:09.720
Is it actually there or not?

21:11.160 --> 21:11.920
Ada.

21:11.920 --> 21:13.119
Still dodging.

21:20.920 --> 21:23.200
Miss Han Lu, are you okay?

21:23.759 --> 21:24.640
He's okay.

21:24.640 --> 21:25.799
We're just getting started.

21:29.720 --> 21:31.799
Quickly release Miss Han Lu.

21:31.799 --> 21:32.240
Good.

21:32.559 --> 21:33.279
Let go.

21:45.279 --> 21:46.279
Sini, sini Tuan Zhongzuo.

21:46.279 --> 21:47.599
Come here please.

21:51.200 --> 21:52.160
He is very brave.

21:57.680 --> 21:58.559
To go to Taihe Company.

21:59.000 --> 21:59.519
Good.

22:10.880 --> 22:11.119
Here.

22:11.119 --> 22:11.720
Here.

22:17.880 --> 22:19.440
Miss Han Lu, are you okay?

22:20.519 --> 22:21.039
It doesn't matter.

22:21.680 --> 22:23.119
Thank you very much, Nita.

22:27.440 --> 22:28.880
Rancid Girl, you're quite cruel.

22:29.720 --> 22:30.279
Chief.

22:30.839 --> 22:31.960
Naoki Neta.

22:31.960 --> 22:33.880
How did he know we captured Han Lu?

22:34.079 --> 22:35.279
Still ask me.

22:35.839 --> 22:37.640
Someone must have done it.

22:41.240 --> 22:41.880
How is section chief Chen?

22:48.799 --> 22:49.759
qian Xiu Cai

22:50.480 --> 22:51.160
section chief Chen

22:51.680 --> 22:53.039
Has the magazine I ordered arrived?

22:53.240 --> 22:54.200
What magazine?

22:54.319 --> 22:55.160
Xin Guang.

22:56.319 --> 22:57.160
Section Chief Chen

22:57.319 --> 22:58.599
Why have you been interested lately?

22:58.599 --> 22:59.960
see this beautiful girl's painting?

23:00.440 --> 23:01.599
Isn't it because recently...

23:01.599 --> 23:03.720
The cover is the famous artist Miss Han Lu?

23:03.839 --> 23:06.160
OK, I'll find it for you.

23:12.839 --> 23:13.319
Have found.

23:13.319 --> 23:14.480
I've found it, I've found it.

23:14.720 --> 23:15.599
Come section chief Chen

23:19.079 --> 23:19.599
qian Xiu Cai

23:19.599 --> 23:20.839
do you think this Miss Han Lu,

23:20.839 --> 23:22.519
Is everything you see good?

23:23.720 --> 23:24.720
I'm just looking.

23:24.960 --> 23:26.759
How can you admire a great artist like this?

23:26.759 --> 23:28.440
My job is to guard the door.

23:28.440 --> 23:29.440
No need to look at the big artists.

23:29.640 --> 23:30.599
OK, I'll go first.

23:38.680 --> 23:40.559
You said this magazine cover is still alive?

23:42.880 --> 23:43.799
Owned by Han Lu.

23:44.200 --> 23:45.519
Why are you here?

23:48.279 --> 23:49.160
Don't make a fuss.

23:49.160 --> 23:50.200
Look who's here.

23:51.880 --> 23:52.799
Kapten Ueda.

23:55.319 --> 23:56.880
I'm a fan of Miss Han Lu.

23:57.160 --> 23:58.079
I don't know if I can or not.

23:58.079 --> 24:00.319
Ask Miss Han Lu to sign for me.

24:04.279 --> 24:05.960
It's okay, I'll help you sign it.

24:05.960 --> 24:06.559
Very fast.

24:10.759 --> 24:11.720
Owned by Han Lu.

24:26.920 --> 24:28.200
He must have loved it

24:28.480 --> 24:29.960
the film played by Miss Han Lu.

24:31.759 --> 24:33.119
Thank you for contacting Naeda.

24:33.640 --> 24:34.960
Yapei Road number 72,

24:36.000 --> 24:36.480
hey!

24:37.000 --> 24:37.920
How about you?

24:38.160 --> 24:39.480
I've found a home.

24:39.839 --> 24:40.440
How about you?

24:40.720 --> 24:42.720
Those guys didn't make trouble with you later, right?

24:42.720 --> 24:43.799
I'm okay, just calm down.

24:45.359 --> 24:45.759
Good.

24:46.319 --> 24:46.960
The address you mean

24:46.960 --> 24:47.720
I'll note it first.

24:50.960 --> 24:52.839
Number 72, Jalan Yapet.

24:53.240 --> 24:54.680
Fine, I know.

24:55.000 --> 24:55.839
Until found.

25:16.519 --> 25:17.359
Thank you Miss Han Lu.

25:18.480 --> 25:18.880
Two o'clock in the afternoon.

25:21.519 --> 25:22.319
What did you say?

25:22.319 --> 25:23.359
Miss Han Lu is very weak.

25:23.359 --> 25:24.319
Don't bother him.

25:24.319 --> 25:24.839
Good.

25:25.039 --> 25:26.359
Take Miss Han Lu to my car.

25:26.759 --> 25:27.799
I took him to the hospital.

25:27.799 --> 25:28.240
Good.

25:28.240 --> 25:28.519
Here.

25:28.519 --> 25:29.160
Hurry up.

25:29.720 --> 25:30.200
Slowly.

25:33.599 --> 25:35.119
Heart

25:37.880 --> 25:38.599
heart

25:40.720 --> 25:41.200
Good.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.160
Later look for me in my office.

25:49.160 --> 25:49.880
What is it?

26:02.720 --> 26:03.680
These two Japanese

26:03.680 --> 26:04.599
now in Shanghai,

26:06.000 --> 26:07.079
are you able

26:07.720 --> 26:08.799
find them out

26:12.599 --> 26:13.960
who are these two people?

26:16.640 --> 26:18.359
The background of this problem is very complicated.

26:19.400 --> 26:20.920
The reason why Zhao An forced him to confess to Han Lu

26:20.920 --> 26:22.200
is also related to this.

26:26.400 --> 26:27.799
Now Zhao An has lost,

26:29.240 --> 26:30.640
our chance has come.

26:39.400 --> 26:41.200
Jalan Yapet No. 72,

26:47.519 --> 26:48.279
Please come in.

26:51.200 --> 26:51.680
Section Chief Chen.

26:52.359 --> 26:53.119
Feng Qi brothers

26:54.160 --> 26:55.359
his hand was slightly injured

26:55.759 --> 26:56.559
Want to go to the hospital.

26:58.319 --> 26:58.839
My brother.

26:58.839 --> 26:59.880
This is not a small wound,

26:59.880 --> 27:00.720
have to go quickly.

27:00.720 --> 27:01.720
Small wound, small wound.

27:02.119 --> 27:02.720
This is because

27:02.720 --> 27:04.519
looking for you to open the injury confirmation letter.

27:04.519 --> 27:05.599
I've only just been able to receive public funds.

27:05.599 --> 27:06.839
Just got to the hospital.

27:07.200 --> 27:07.920
Understand.

27:09.319 --> 27:10.839
You talk about these officials,

27:10.839 --> 27:12.559
making this a vague formality

27:12.920 --> 27:13.400
truly.

27:13.400 --> 27:15.559
If we get shot while on duty,

27:15.559 --> 27:17.319
After returning, you have to fill in the form before you can be saved.

27:17.839 --> 27:18.599
Ridiculous

27:18.839 --> 27:20.079
all this bureaucracy

27:20.079 --> 27:21.039
will be delayed.

27:21.400 --> 27:23.000
How did you get hurt?

27:24.039 --> 27:26.079
Han Lu was bitten by a smelly woman.

27:27.279 --> 27:28.680
Han Lu.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.279
Sorry, section chief Chen.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.079
I forgot you're a Han Lu fan.

27:34.799 --> 27:35.519
It doesn't matter.

27:35.720 --> 27:36.720
Fans are fans.

27:36.920 --> 27:38.119
Brothers are still brothers.

27:39.119 --> 27:40.920
How do you think it got hurt?

27:41.440 --> 27:42.599
Bitten by frost.

27:42.880 --> 27:44.319
Sorry, my smelly mouth.

27:44.319 --> 27:45.279
Sorry section chief Chen

27:47.839 --> 27:48.839
brother Feng Qi

27:49.559 --> 27:50.799
we have to do it according to the rules

27:51.079 --> 27:52.279
what does it mean?

27:57.319 --> 27:57.880
No rush.

27:57.880 --> 27:59.599
I'll turn it around for you.

28:01.200 --> 28:01.799
Article 4.

28:02.400 --> 28:03.000
Article 6.

28:04.359 --> 28:05.880
Here, here look.

28:06.200 --> 28:07.880
Article 7, point 3 regulates that

28:09.759 --> 28:12.640
Work accidents are violence that occurs

28:12.640 --> 28:15.559
violence due to work responsibilities,

28:15.559 --> 28:16.599
accidental injury, etc.

28:16.599 --> 28:18.160
Can be considered an injury at work.

28:18.440 --> 28:19.240
Correct.

28:19.240 --> 28:20.319
This is an on-the-job injury.

28:20.680 --> 28:21.720
But brother Feng Qi

28:22.039 --> 28:23.079
catching frost

28:23.319 --> 28:25.599
That is the personality of you and Captain Zhao.

28:25.960 --> 28:27.759
Naoki Neta and Manager Luo

28:27.759 --> 28:28.920
don't agree.

28:29.279 --> 28:31.599
Of course it cannot be considered as carrying out official duties,

28:31.599 --> 28:33.119
then it does not include work-related injuries.

28:33.119 --> 28:33.680
Correct?

28:34.000 --> 28:35.359
If so, you mean,

28:35.839 --> 28:37.039
I was bitten in vain

28:37.960 --> 28:38.720
brother Feng Qi

28:39.559 --> 28:41.079
I only acted fairly.

28:41.359 --> 28:42.119
Chief Chen

28:42.559 --> 28:44.119
I feel like you kinda

28:44.359 --> 28:45.759
to take personal revenge on the company

28:45.960 --> 28:47.000
brother Feng Qi

28:47.000 --> 28:48.079
Personal revenge in this company is not

28:48.960 --> 28:49.359
ketua tim Zhao

28:49.359 --> 28:49.880
leader

28:50.960 --> 28:51.839
Wrong signature.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.680
Captain Zhao, I'm really sorry.

28:58.680 --> 29:00.039
It's all my fault for being careless.

29:00.039 --> 29:01.440
Please go alone.

29:01.440 --> 29:02.319
Next time you call me.

29:02.319 --> 29:03.119
I will deliver it to you.

29:03.519 --> 29:04.440
No next time.

29:06.319 --> 29:07.240
Chief don't go

29:07.519 --> 29:08.240
you came at the right time

29:08.240 --> 29:09.119
try checking.

29:09.440 --> 29:11.559
Section Chief Chen did not think this was a work accident

29:12.720 --> 29:13.279
brother Feng Qi

29:13.279 --> 29:15.160
if you really think I'm taking personal revenge on the company

29:15.640 --> 29:16.839
You go find Manager Luo

29:17.240 --> 29:19.200
or report to me at the Military Commander.

29:19.720 --> 29:20.880
Chairman Zhao, I am...

29:21.119 --> 29:22.519
I will act fairly.

29:24.039 --> 29:25.119
Just a small wound

29:26.200 --> 29:27.799
couldn't he bandage wounds?

29:28.880 --> 29:30.319
He didn't identify a work accident for you,

29:30.799 --> 29:31.720
pack it yourself.

29:32.000 --> 29:32.720
OK, Captain.

29:33.039 --> 29:34.400
I'll wrap it myself.

29:34.599 --> 29:36.400
I know how to wrap wounds.

29:37.680 --> 29:39.279
My ex-girlfriend, Xiao Fang, is studying in Japan.

29:39.279 --> 29:40.640
Captain Zhao, I'll bring it to you in a moment.

29:40.640 --> 29:41.839
He taught me.

29:46.920 --> 29:48.200
I made it myself.

29:48.200 --> 29:49.799
Better than the hospital

30:11.920 --> 30:12.960
something happened, section chief Chen.

30:13.279 --> 30:14.680
The left twin wants to jump from the building.

30:14.920 --> 30:16.200
Left twin peaches want to jump off the building!

30:34.839 --> 30:35.640
Liuli Guoguo.

30:36.079 --> 30:36.599
What are you doing?

30:36.599 --> 30:37.119
Hurry down

30:38.359 --> 30:39.240
chen Jia Ping

30:40.319 --> 30:41.960
do you want to divorce me?

30:43.920 --> 30:45.680
If you want to divorce me

30:46.440 --> 30:47.960
then I'll jump.

30:48.319 --> 30:49.599
What's the problem, we'll talk about it again after we go downstairs.

30:49.839 --> 30:50.680
Don't come here.

30:52.160 --> 30:52.880
In the future

30:53.039 --> 30:53.640
Good.

30:54.319 --> 30:55.000
I'm not here.

30:56.119 --> 30:57.039
What is the problem

30:57.640 --> 30:59.799
we go down anyway can talk

31:00.400 --> 31:01.720
It's fine if I go down.

31:03.359 --> 31:04.319
You apologize first.

31:07.440 --> 31:08.799
Why should I apologize?

31:09.119 --> 31:10.440
Why should I apologize?

31:11.039 --> 31:12.880
You were the one who wronged me first.

31:12.880 --> 31:14.240
You hit me?

31:15.400 --> 31:16.200
I'm an adult

31:16.200 --> 31:17.960
no one ever hit me

31:20.359 --> 31:22.599
and you're very heavy

31:24.400 --> 31:26.640
Until now my face here still hurts.

31:27.559 --> 31:28.759
Why are you coming home?

31:33.720 --> 31:34.880
You don't want to apologize, do you?

31:35.160 --> 31:36.440
Do you want to apologize or not?

31:39.839 --> 31:40.720
Fine.

31:41.200 --> 31:42.640
can i apologize

31:43.240 --> 31:44.440
It's all my fault.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.240
This is all my fault.

31:46.240 --> 31:49.039
I shouldn't have slapped you.

31:49.960 --> 31:50.599
I am wrong.

31:52.119 --> 31:52.720
Come down

31:52.839 --> 31:53.200
here.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.400
Come down.

31:55.599 --> 31:56.200
This can't be done.

31:57.799 --> 31:58.920
You're the only one apologizing.

31:58.920 --> 31:59.440
This can't be done.

32:02.599 --> 32:04.359
This is both of our problems

32:04.359 --> 32:05.759
who else apologized to you?

32:06.519 --> 32:06.960
I...

32:13.319 --> 32:14.000
I'm humble.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.400
I used a letter to threaten Miss Zuo

32:18.119 --> 32:20.039
so this problem occurs.

32:20.880 --> 32:21.519
Sorry,

32:22.319 --> 32:23.160
but i hope

32:23.640 --> 32:25.799
You shouldn't leave the company because of this.

32:26.680 --> 32:27.559
Because here,

32:28.559 --> 32:29.440
someone needs you.

32:33.680 --> 32:34.519
I mean is

32:36.559 --> 32:37.279
Section Chief Chen.

32:38.440 --> 32:39.119
Liuli Guoguo.

32:40.200 --> 32:42.079
The person who should apologize, has already apologized to you.

32:42.440 --> 32:43.359
Don't make any more noise.

32:43.359 --> 32:43.960
Hurry down.

32:44.160 --> 32:44.799
Can't.

32:47.079 --> 32:48.359
There is still one more person who wants to apologize.

32:50.599 --> 32:51.359
Yes, that's me.

32:52.720 --> 32:53.839
It is my fault.

32:55.000 --> 32:55.799
I am not good.

32:56.960 --> 32:58.079
I'm so careless.

32:59.319 --> 33:00.359
And hurt you.

33:00.880 --> 33:02.720
Hurt our feelings.

33:04.119 --> 33:05.920
I do not want to lose you.

33:07.920 --> 33:10.599
You are the only person I can rely on in my life.

33:11.519 --> 33:12.160
So...

33:14.279 --> 33:16.400
My husband, please forgive me.

33:17.880 --> 33:18.920
Give me...

33:19.880 --> 33:22.119
Our love has one more chance.

33:23.400 --> 33:24.279
Isn't that good?

33:26.400 --> 33:28.079
Everyone will make mistakes.

33:29.079 --> 33:31.319
Have you forgotten what you said at the wedding?

33:32.000 --> 33:32.880
Say.

33:33.440 --> 33:34.839
You're not perfect

33:36.000 --> 33:37.440
I'm not perfect either

33:38.720 --> 33:39.640
but...

33:40.039 --> 33:41.680
However, we are together...

33:43.039 --> 33:44.759
It's perfect.

33:46.680 --> 33:48.000
Still remember.

33:49.880 --> 33:50.519
In that case,

33:51.640 --> 33:53.680
let's get down together perfectly

33:55.200 --> 33:55.680
Good?

33:57.759 --> 33:58.279
Good.

34:13.559 --> 34:15.440
But I still can't forgive you.

34:16.159 --> 34:18.000
Little by little I want to die

34:18.440 --> 34:20.159
is a knowledgeable and cultured person.

34:20.159 --> 34:21.360
Why are you such a fierce woman?

34:23.280 --> 34:24.280
You don't forgive me

34:24.559 --> 34:25.920
I still haven't forgiven you.

34:26.719 --> 34:27.760
Just now at the door,

34:28.000 --> 34:29.159
why are you hugging the cold dew?

34:29.800 --> 34:30.639
I didn't hug him.

34:30.800 --> 34:32.159
He passed out, I'm daddy.

34:33.360 --> 34:34.400
How ridiculous.

34:35.000 --> 34:35.719
Seeing other people is not dizzy,

34:35.719 --> 34:36.480
to meet you?

34:36.719 --> 34:38.360
Still holding it for so long, not letting go.

34:38.360 --> 34:39.480
Do not let go.

34:39.639 --> 34:40.400
Good.

34:41.239 --> 34:41.719
I was wrong, I was wrong.

34:41.719 --> 34:42.960
Disband, disband.

34:43.320 --> 34:44.239
Let's have a meeting.

34:44.239 --> 34:44.880
Not meeting people.

34:44.880 --> 34:46.360
You guys are the ones who see the most commotion.

34:47.119 --> 34:48.920
Recently.

34:55.159 --> 34:56.079
What problem do you have?

34:56.079 --> 34:57.360
Close the door, talk quietly.

35:15.039 --> 35:16.400
Shooing away the ducks, go up to the stage.

35:17.519 --> 35:18.800
Act like this.

35:19.199 --> 35:21.440
So that everyone feels that we are good again

35:21.599 --> 35:22.239
right, right?

35:27.719 --> 35:28.920
You're good too.

35:45.639 --> 35:46.920
The left twin peach is back.

35:48.559 --> 35:49.639
Not just coming back,

35:50.199 --> 35:52.400
he also forced me to act with him in the shop.

35:52.679 --> 35:54.079
Make him go away

35:54.079 --> 35:55.920
and why come back, this problem is solved

35:57.000 --> 35:57.639
I'm thinking

35:58.360 --> 35:59.280
whether it is military power

35:59.280 --> 36:00.639
have any urgent tasks?

36:02.400 --> 36:02.960
There is a possibility

36:04.159 --> 36:04.960
maybe this time

36:06.239 --> 36:07.519
ready to lurk for a long time

36:09.320 --> 36:09.920
old way

36:10.559 --> 36:12.440
this time don't think about telling me to leave again.

36:12.440 --> 36:13.199
I don't want to.

36:14.400 --> 36:15.639
This is not for you to determine

36:15.639 --> 36:16.920
I'm not the one who can determine.

36:16.920 --> 36:18.239
This is an organizational decision.

36:18.239 --> 36:19.639
Now the situation has changed

36:19.639 --> 36:21.239
I'll have to ask the organization for instructions again

36:21.239 --> 36:22.360
If that's the case, I'll write the request.

36:23.239 --> 36:25.360
If the organization allows me to stay and continue scouting,

36:26.000 --> 36:26.719
I can guarantee,

36:26.960 --> 36:28.000
will not affect

36:28.000 --> 36:29.079
affecting the security of my identity.

36:29.079 --> 36:29.719
And my job.

36:30.199 --> 36:30.920
I'll write now

36:30.920 --> 36:31.800
I will use this inkstone

36:33.760 --> 36:34.880
Do not rush

36:35.440 --> 36:36.760
even though you have written the application,

36:38.079 --> 36:40.039
it takes time for the organization to agree.

36:40.719 --> 36:42.039
Now the most important thing is,

36:42.039 --> 36:43.440
because the Left Twin is back,

36:43.800 --> 36:45.639
How do you manage your relationship with him?

36:46.239 --> 36:47.239
I feel,

36:47.760 --> 36:49.599
if I pretend I don't know anything anymore,

36:49.960 --> 36:51.960
instead, it's like I'm covering something up.

36:52.960 --> 36:54.639
So it's better if I ask him directly.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.079
After all, he's home,

36:56.400 --> 36:58.280
must have thought of a way to explain it to me.

36:58.760 --> 36:59.920
So I will take advantage of it.

37:00.440 --> 37:02.119
Pretend to believe it, explain it to him.

37:03.760 --> 37:05.239
This is enough for the time being.

37:06.719 --> 37:07.920
It shouldn't be a problem either.

37:09.639 --> 37:10.280
The old way

37:10.719 --> 37:11.880
That secret letter was for you

37:11.880 --> 37:12.719
has it been solved?

37:13.760 --> 37:14.360
Already.

37:16.280 --> 37:17.199
Very valuable.

37:17.559 --> 37:18.519
Is a person

37:18.880 --> 37:19.920
who is hiding in Yan'an.

37:19.920 --> 37:22.360
With the code name Dayan from the General's spy.

37:23.280 --> 37:24.800
There are military spies in Yan'an,

37:25.800 --> 37:27.119
is being examined in secret.

37:27.880 --> 37:29.000
Reportedly there are still no results.

37:30.119 --> 37:30.800
Fill in the secret message

37:30.800 --> 37:33.639
related to the economic and financial conditions of Yan'an.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.960
It's not a secret story.

37:36.519 --> 37:37.440
But the fighters

37:37.440 --> 37:39.119
because he attaches so much importance to this secret call,...

37:39.280 --> 37:40.880
It shouldn't be about the content,

37:41.480 --> 37:43.719
but this spy nicknamed Dayan

37:44.920 --> 37:45.559
big goose

37:49.519 --> 37:51.280
Pretty cool too.

37:59.159 --> 38:00.960
Since when did you learn to cook?

38:02.360 --> 38:03.480
You can always do that.

38:05.440 --> 38:06.239
Why come back?

38:08.159 --> 38:09.360
I am your wife.

38:09.599 --> 38:10.440
Those two people,

38:10.440 --> 38:12.039
I asked why did you come home?

38:13.239 --> 38:15.000
Previously my company was in Wuhan

38:15.639 --> 38:16.920
has been dismissed.

38:17.480 --> 38:19.159
I don't have any work there,

38:19.519 --> 38:20.599
I'm better

38:21.280 --> 38:22.280
live in Shanghai,

38:22.960 --> 38:23.760
accompany my husband.

38:28.039 --> 38:28.760
Left twin.

38:29.559 --> 38:30.639
I asked again.

38:30.639 --> 38:31.880
Why did you come back?

38:39.280 --> 38:41.719
Do you really have no feelings for me at all?

38:48.800 --> 38:50.920
Guoguo, haven't we both agreed?

38:51.920 --> 38:53.239
This way,

38:53.239 --> 38:54.400
is the best ending

38:54.599 --> 38:55.920
now you're home,

38:56.679 --> 38:58.320
will bring a lot of trouble for us.

38:58.320 --> 38:59.000
Don't you know?

39:03.280 --> 39:05.199
I lost contact with my organization.

39:05.880 --> 39:06.559
What organization?

39:07.440 --> 39:08.000
The team.

39:12.679 --> 39:13.239
What is it?

39:14.920 --> 39:16.039
Never saw the General.

39:16.960 --> 39:18.239
I've never met anyone still alive.

39:18.920 --> 39:19.960
I'm joking with you.

39:20.199 --> 39:21.519
How could it be military power?

39:21.960 --> 39:22.960
My organization

39:22.960 --> 39:24.000
it's called the Soul Group.

39:24.360 --> 39:26.079
I joined when I was in Wuhan.

39:26.679 --> 39:27.360
What team?

39:28.000 --> 39:29.519
Just a few young people who love the country,

39:29.719 --> 39:31.440
who wanted to do something to fight Japan and save the country.

39:33.079 --> 39:34.400
Are you really not a commander?

39:35.119 --> 39:36.400
Really isn't it?

39:37.199 --> 39:39.159
So the soldiers had killed very many,

39:39.920 --> 39:40.719
look at me.

39:41.679 --> 39:42.239
Similar or not?

39:43.800 --> 39:45.599
Why don't you go back to Wuhan?

39:46.800 --> 39:47.840
Didn't I just say that?

39:47.840 --> 39:49.800
I lost contact with my organization.

39:50.079 --> 39:51.280
My boss disappeared.

39:51.480 --> 39:52.519
So if I don't find it,

39:52.679 --> 39:54.599
I can't contact my organization.

39:55.320 --> 39:56.199
I don't believe it.

39:57.360 --> 39:58.280
Of course you guys

39:58.280 --> 40:00.280
there's a new assignment, right?

40:01.719 --> 40:02.880
Where are the new tasks?

40:03.239 --> 40:04.559
Our organization

40:04.559 --> 40:05.840
everything is a minor fuss

40:06.760 --> 40:08.440
one hammer in the east and one stick in the west

40:08.920 --> 40:10.119
can't do anything big

40:10.639 --> 40:11.360
however,

40:11.360 --> 40:12.480
is an anti-Japanese group, right?

40:13.480 --> 40:15.639
If Lao Luo and Zhao An were found out,

40:15.760 --> 40:17.480
I became a member of an anti-Japanese family.

40:18.280 --> 40:19.400
Aren't you going to involve me?

40:20.000 --> 40:21.360
Are you okay?

40:22.239 --> 40:24.360
There are many organizations like us.

40:24.360 --> 40:26.239
So there are so many Middle Commanders

40:26.239 --> 40:26.760
Chinese Communist Party.

40:27.360 --> 40:28.239
Can't be caught

40:28.800 --> 40:30.119
who will care about us?

40:30.400 --> 40:31.320
What did I involve you in?

40:31.320 --> 40:33.119
Gao Fang also knows your identity.

40:33.679 --> 40:34.360
If you go,

40:34.360 --> 40:35.320
there is no proof of his words.

40:35.760 --> 40:36.960
Now you're back,

40:37.440 --> 40:38.880
what if he threatens you again?

40:39.639 --> 40:41.400
I guarantee he won't threaten me.

40:43.840 --> 40:45.000
On what basis are you

40:45.000 --> 40:46.559
why do you have so many questions?

40:49.880 --> 40:51.199
Coward.

40:51.679 --> 40:52.599
This doesn't look like you.

40:53.519 --> 40:54.480
Isn't it similar?

40:54.960 --> 40:56.880
If you're scared,

40:57.639 --> 40:59.480
you would have taken such a big risk that day.

40:59.960 --> 41:01.320
To help me at the cafe.

41:03.760 --> 41:05.400
I am a person who has intelligence.

41:05.719 --> 41:07.000
Now that I think about it

41:07.199 --> 41:08.239
still sweating coldly

41:10.639 --> 41:12.400
don't know if you're really scared

41:13.679 --> 41:15.039
or pretend to be afraid.

41:15.679 --> 41:17.119
Of course I'm scared.

41:17.639 --> 41:19.159
Even if you don't involve me,

41:19.679 --> 41:21.920
if your organization knows about me,

41:22.159 --> 41:22.960
kill me to silence me?

41:22.960 --> 41:23.480
How about this?

41:24.280 --> 41:27.280
Biggest case we've ever done

41:27.719 --> 41:29.360
is burning Wang Pu Jun's barn.

41:29.639 --> 41:32.000
Isn't killing me a bigger case?

41:35.039 --> 41:36.480
So you won't betray me, right?

41:38.559 --> 41:40.239
What if I betray you?

41:42.840 --> 41:44.320
Then I...

41:44.320 --> 41:44.960
What are you doing?

41:46.320 --> 41:46.880
I will...

41:47.920 --> 41:48.639
A storm.

41:48.880 --> 41:49.519
Don't.

41:51.159 --> 41:52.199
Then I'm more afraid.

41:53.599 --> 41:54.280
It's good to be afraid.

41:56.079 --> 41:56.519
Good.

41:57.480 --> 41:58.639
Left twin.

41:58.639 --> 42:00.199
I can not betray you.

42:00.199 --> 42:03.119
But you have to guarantee my safety.

42:05.320 --> 42:06.559
As long as you don't betray me,

42:07.239 --> 42:09.159
I not only guarantee your safety,

42:10.159 --> 42:11.960
I'm still your wife.

42:13.079 --> 42:14.800
Every day cooking for you.

42:18.199 --> 42:19.000
To be honest,

42:20.440 --> 42:21.519
when you see me again,

42:23.400 --> 42:25.000
do you feel a little happy?

42:27.679 --> 42:28.239
No.

42:30.159 --> 42:31.000
I know,

42:31.519 --> 42:33.039
now you treat me with half sincerity.

42:35.280 --> 42:36.159
Which is real and which is fake.

42:36.880 --> 42:37.679
The mouth is fake.

42:41.239 --> 42:42.639
The heart is genuine.

42:47.719 --> 42:48.400
Eat a lot.

42:49.960 --> 42:50.519
Eat it.

42:51.400 --> 42:53.400
Why? Afraid I'll poison him?

42:55.199 --> 42:56.280
I'll eat it for you too.

42:59.599 --> 43:00.320
Not poison.

43:01.320 --> 43:01.960
But salty.

43:10.079 --> 43:11.199
How about this?

43:11.679 --> 43:12.599
Just delivered,

43:12.599 --> 43:13.639
now it's back.

43:14.159 --> 43:15.400
Judging from this attitude,

43:15.400 --> 43:16.960
is preparing to lurk for a long time

43:18.119 --> 43:19.599
maybe because of this problem,

43:19.599 --> 43:20.760
then told me to go.

43:21.360 --> 43:23.679
The worst thing is that there is still a mission tomorrow.

43:25.920 --> 43:26.960
Is there anything to do tomorrow?

43:28.079 --> 43:29.599
Tomorrow there are business matters.

43:31.679 --> 43:33.599
Still have business on Sunday?

43:34.599 --> 43:37.039
It seems like being a traitor is also tiring.

43:37.719 --> 43:41.079
I am a traitor who has ideals and ambitions.

43:42.960 --> 43:43.360
How about you?

43:44.400 --> 43:45.199
What do you want to do tomorrow?

43:46.440 --> 43:47.920
My uncle is looking for me on business.

43:49.199 --> 43:50.119
Okay.

43:50.440 --> 43:52.360
Tomorrow you'll just be busy with your business.

43:52.800 --> 43:53.880
I'm busy with my business.

44:00.480 --> 44:02.320
Tomorrow at two o'clock in the afternoon,

44:03.440 --> 44:05.440
Yer Pei Street Number 72,
