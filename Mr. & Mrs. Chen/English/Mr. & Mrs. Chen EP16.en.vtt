01:34.439 --> 01:35.200
you say

01:36.400 --> 01:38.599
Was it really Feng Qi who bandaged Jiang Zhaoguo?

01:40.680 --> 01:42.239
I do not know then

01:43.400 --> 01:46.560
Does anyone know how Feng Qi was bandaged?

01:47.079 --> 01:49.120
Then he conspired with Jiang Zhaoguo

01:49.560 --> 01:50.959
He was framed together

01:51.719 --> 01:53.640
I would like to ask Mr. Jiang to do me a favor

01:53.799 --> 01:54.319
you say

01:54.719 --> 01:56.200
I think he will definitely agree

01:57.120 --> 01:57.760
That's it

01:58.359 --> 01:59.640
Can Mr. Jiang

01:59.640 --> 02:01.000
When being interviewed by reporters

02:01.319 --> 02:02.760
Use the figure-eight spiral method

02:03.079 --> 02:04.159
bandage his injured right arm

02:05.159 --> 02:06.120
This is the bandaging process

02:06.799 --> 02:08.360
And when the photo was published in the newspaper

02:08.439 --> 02:11.039
Be sure to take a good look at his bandaged right arm

02:13.400 --> 02:14.840
What a strange request

02:15.639 --> 02:17.039
But for you

02:17.199 --> 02:18.599
It doesn't seem surprising

02:19.960 --> 02:20.639
Wife

02:21.159 --> 02:22.520
You’ve read too much wild history

02:22.520 --> 02:24.000
How could there be so much conspiracy?

02:24.599 --> 02:26.680
At most, God opens his eyes

02:26.879 --> 02:28.319
Think Feng Qi has done many evil things

02:28.319 --> 02:31.639
Plus my wisdom root, right?

02:31.919 --> 02:32.879
Was woken up all of a sudden

02:32.879 --> 02:34.240
Discovered this detail about him

02:34.879 --> 02:35.840
Anyway, in one sentence

02:36.039 --> 02:37.560
It’s Feng Qi who deserves to be unlucky

02:38.520 --> 02:39.560
I think so too

02:41.039 --> 02:42.159
Came back from get off work

02:44.159 --> 02:45.759
You mean this big horse spoon?

02:45.759 --> 02:47.199
This note I got

02:47.879 --> 02:52.360
It was really the information that Feng Qi passed on to Juntong.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.560
It's all Feng Qi's handwriting

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
It definitely can’t be fake

02:58.879 --> 03:01.159
Could it be that someone framed him?

03:01.680 --> 03:03.000
he is so smart

03:03.120 --> 03:04.639
Who could frame him?

03:05.319 --> 03:06.240
That Feng Qi who doubted you

03:06.240 --> 03:07.560
I found someone to follow him

03:07.639 --> 03:09.000
He went to Nanjing Pukou Station

03:09.000 --> 03:11.719
Looking for a vendor selling sachets

03:12.599 --> 03:14.479
Could it be that the sachet I lost is in Feng Qi’s hand?

03:14.639 --> 03:15.919
What's wrong? There's trouble.

03:17.680 --> 03:18.879
Who is following him?

03:19.439 --> 03:20.280
My name is Li Youtian

03:20.280 --> 03:21.039
Are you smart enough?

03:21.280 --> 03:22.000
no problem

03:22.400 --> 03:23.879
I want him to do something for me

03:24.479 --> 03:26.719
Could it be this Li Youtian?

03:26.960 --> 03:28.759
Trick Feng Qi into writing something

03:28.759 --> 03:30.520
Words with completely different meanings

03:31.319 --> 03:33.360
Then select a few words and cut them out

03:33.879 --> 03:35.000
Where is Feng Qi framed?

03:36.599 --> 03:37.439
Let me say

03:37.439 --> 03:38.039
You write it

03:38.039 --> 03:40.199
I guarantee that after Li Youtian arrives in Shanghai

03:40.639 --> 03:41.560
personal safety

03:41.680 --> 03:42.919
Promise to help Li Youtian

03:43.199 --> 03:45.199
Bought Hong Xiang Ji’s three-yellow chicken

03:45.439 --> 03:46.719
Fuyunzhai’s bean paste cake

03:47.439 --> 03:49.120
Reimburse all travel expenses

03:50.199 --> 03:51.560
And the cost of eating in restaurants

03:53.759 --> 03:56.080
I said you have read too many detective novels, right?

03:57.120 --> 03:58.919
Who would put so much thought into it?

03:59.639 --> 04:00.719
Frame him

04:03.080 --> 04:04.319
That makes sense

04:05.360 --> 04:07.240
Anyway, it’s Feng Qi

04:07.800 --> 04:08.960
Deserve bad luck

04:09.199 --> 04:09.719
right

04:09.919 --> 04:10.639
Let's go

04:11.639 --> 04:13.360
I really don’t understand you very well

04:16.199 --> 04:18.319
Say you're a traitor who's messing around

04:19.519 --> 04:21.120
Sometimes you are quite brave

04:21.439 --> 04:23.240
Not only brave but also thoughtful

04:24.439 --> 04:26.120
I don't even know your beliefs

04:26.759 --> 04:27.639
what exactly is it

04:29.040 --> 04:30.000
my faith

04:30.000 --> 04:31.199
That is

04:32.240 --> 04:33.040
i love

04:33.839 --> 04:35.040
And what I love

04:38.439 --> 04:39.439
what do you love

04:39.959 --> 04:40.680
money

04:41.240 --> 04:42.160
And home

04:42.920 --> 04:44.079
Let's go home

04:50.120 --> 04:51.560
Lao Luo, look for me

04:52.040 --> 04:52.920
Come, come, come

04:53.839 --> 04:55.079
What does it smell like to you?

04:56.800 --> 04:57.720
Zhao An is here

04:57.920 --> 04:58.240
Yeah

04:58.240 --> 04:59.639
He is now responsible for raising horses

04:59.920 --> 05:00.560
so

05:00.560 --> 05:01.959
Horse shit taste

05:02.519 --> 05:03.680
Such a great taste

05:04.040 --> 05:05.560
Are you still in the mood to draw?

05:05.680 --> 05:07.120
Just because of the smell of horse manure

05:07.120 --> 05:08.000
I'm inspired

05:08.120 --> 05:09.639
Look at the horse picture

05:09.800 --> 05:10.680
abnormal

05:11.199 --> 05:12.319
What are you doing here?

05:12.480 --> 05:13.480
Handover

05:13.800 --> 05:15.240
His future trading group three

05:15.480 --> 05:16.560
The work is mine

05:16.639 --> 05:18.240
You're responsible for part of it

05:18.360 --> 05:19.079
That won't work

05:19.600 --> 05:21.240
What should I do with the general affairs department?

05:21.480 --> 05:23.319
Chief of the General Affairs Section, you are in charge.

05:24.399 --> 05:27.079
He is just handing over the work to me temporarily.

05:27.879 --> 05:30.480
But I hate the word "temporary" very much

05:30.680 --> 05:31.839
do you understand

05:32.399 --> 05:33.120
clear

05:35.240 --> 05:35.839
And you

05:35.839 --> 05:37.560
I'll double your salary

05:37.920 --> 05:39.360
As for extra money, oil and water, etc.

05:39.360 --> 05:41.000
It depends on your own ability

05:41.800 --> 05:42.639
Where are Zhao An's people?

05:42.639 --> 05:44.199
Basically, everyone is sitting on the bench.

05:44.680 --> 05:47.120
I'll leave everything that can be used to Damashio.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.160
You finally got ahead

05:51.279 --> 05:52.879
Where is my younger brother?

05:52.959 --> 05:54.519
I also had some soup to drink.

05:54.879 --> 05:55.959
Got a car for you

05:55.959 --> 05:57.519
I'll drive your wife to work from now on

05:57.720 --> 05:59.240
No need, I have a motorcycle

05:59.240 --> 06:00.120
hold

06:01.600 --> 06:02.360
Thank you bro

06:04.759 --> 06:06.279
By the way, let me ask you something.

06:06.959 --> 06:09.800
Did Zuo Shuangtao come by train?

06:17.519 --> 06:18.399
what does it mean

06:18.399 --> 06:19.120
Lao Luo

06:19.720 --> 06:20.920
look at you

06:21.839 --> 06:23.120
Feng Qi kidnapped Kimura

06:23.120 --> 06:24.199
Such a big thing

06:24.360 --> 06:26.160
I have to write an inspection report

06:26.160 --> 06:27.439
Talk about doubts

06:28.240 --> 06:29.199
Otherwise it can

06:29.839 --> 06:31.079
can you understand me

06:33.160 --> 06:34.800
I asked her last night

06:35.240 --> 06:36.720
She said that when she was working in Wuhan

06:36.720 --> 06:38.199
There is a man who likes her

06:38.480 --> 06:40.000
Do you know where she went to school in Nanjing?

06:40.000 --> 06:42.079
I bought her a Yunjin sachet

06:42.319 --> 06:43.800
Although she doesn't like that man

06:43.800 --> 06:45.160
But she likes this sachet very much

06:45.160 --> 06:46.319
Just left it

06:46.519 --> 06:47.759
That's it

06:47.920 --> 06:49.319
Then when Zhao An asked her

06:49.439 --> 06:51.079
Why didn't she tell the truth?

06:51.360 --> 06:52.600
Isn't she afraid that I will know?

06:52.600 --> 06:54.519
Do I need to know that I can't rush her?

06:54.759 --> 06:56.759
So she said she bought it at the train station

06:57.199 --> 06:59.279
I didn't expect it would cause such a big deal.

07:00.399 --> 07:01.399
Do you believe it

07:05.120 --> 07:06.040
I said

07:06.279 --> 07:08.399
Do you believe she doesn’t like that guy?

07:10.279 --> 07:11.519
I

07:12.959 --> 07:13.720
Believe it

07:15.319 --> 07:16.439
you hesitated

07:18.240 --> 07:20.160
Let me tell you in this day and age

07:20.600 --> 07:22.319
Women can be very wild

07:23.879 --> 07:25.120
You experience it firsthand

07:27.360 --> 07:28.720
Anyway, where is the woman?

07:29.199 --> 07:30.639
I won't believe it

07:36.800 --> 07:38.399
I trust my wife anyway

07:45.959 --> 07:48.959
These two swords of mine have been traveling around the world for decades.

07:49.120 --> 07:51.079
Do not kill unknown people with the sword

07:51.720 --> 07:52.959
I really didn't expect that

07:53.160 --> 07:55.879
I will actually use it to cut grass and feed horses one day.

07:56.720 --> 07:57.839
I'm Zhao An

07:58.720 --> 08:00.879
How can I accept the humiliation here?

08:02.720 --> 08:04.000
God wants to kill me

08:05.480 --> 08:07.199
I must defy heaven

08:07.800 --> 08:09.879
You two have worked hard with me.

08:12.040 --> 08:13.439
I'm going to die

08:13.519 --> 08:14.639
What are you doing?

08:15.839 --> 08:16.480
team leader

08:16.680 --> 08:17.399
What's wrong

08:18.639 --> 08:20.199
This horse has such a strong temper

08:20.279 --> 08:22.120
Kicked me in the ass

08:27.879 --> 08:29.199
Got kicked

08:31.920 --> 08:33.519
you you

08:33.679 --> 08:34.840
Why are you so stupid?

08:34.840 --> 08:36.240
what can you do

08:37.399 --> 08:38.279
Let me do it

08:42.399 --> 08:43.759
Be careful

08:55.600 --> 08:56.919
Brother, what's wrong with you?

08:58.240 --> 08:59.039
Brother you

08:59.919 --> 09:01.360
Why are you so careless?

09:01.360 --> 09:02.600
rolling

09:02.600 --> 09:03.679
That's easy to say

09:03.679 --> 09:05.720
If you can, go and wipe the horse's body.

09:06.120 --> 09:07.639
I'll go, I'll go

09:07.879 --> 09:08.639
Optimistic

09:09.440 --> 09:10.360
wait

09:11.200 --> 09:12.200
put the knife down

09:12.399 --> 09:13.440
this horse

09:14.399 --> 09:15.960
If a hair falls out

09:16.919 --> 09:17.559
I want it

09:19.039 --> 09:20.039
I want you to kill me

09:24.440 --> 09:25.600
Optimistic

09:28.399 --> 09:29.080
team leader

09:29.080 --> 09:29.840
No need for him to yell

09:29.840 --> 09:30.799
drink water drink water

09:30.799 --> 09:32.039
Wait for him to come out

09:32.759 --> 09:33.759
Where was the kick?

09:34.159 --> 09:35.279
you kick him

09:46.399 --> 09:47.480
Where was the kick?

09:47.519 --> 09:48.559
Don't hold it back

09:49.360 --> 09:50.159
good horse

09:50.639 --> 09:51.879
What a good horse

09:51.879 --> 09:53.960
Do you think he was fooled by the horse?

09:55.519 --> 09:57.480
Kicked in the head, kicked in the temple

09:57.480 --> 09:58.320
Xiaodouzi

10:08.480 --> 10:09.679
Xiaodouzi

10:10.960 --> 10:12.879
This is the name I gave it

10:13.519 --> 10:14.720
is that useful

10:15.279 --> 10:17.759
Chief Kimura named it Takeda Shingen

10:17.759 --> 10:19.120
You call me Xiaodouzi

10:19.360 --> 10:20.240
soybeans

10:20.399 --> 10:21.080
elder brother

10:21.679 --> 10:23.039
You call it Takeda Shingen

10:23.080 --> 10:24.399
See if it answers or not

10:26.279 --> 10:27.440
Takeda Shingen

10:27.559 --> 10:28.120
Xiaodouzi

10:28.120 --> 10:28.960
No trouble, no trouble

10:29.519 --> 10:30.879
Since the horse is so good to you

10:30.879 --> 10:32.120
starting today

10:32.919 --> 10:35.240
You give the horse a bath

10:35.360 --> 10:35.879
OK

10:35.879 --> 10:36.679
no problem

10:37.120 --> 10:38.159
trunk

10:38.720 --> 10:39.879
We have

10:40.960 --> 10:42.120
new tasks

10:42.159 --> 10:42.840
team leader

10:42.840 --> 10:44.559
What new tasks do we have?

10:45.000 --> 10:46.600
Transport feed

11:02.320 --> 11:03.080
interesting

11:04.519 --> 11:06.000
ten little indians

11:06.360 --> 11:08.200
One person choked to death, and there were nine left.

11:09.559 --> 11:11.600
Nine little Indians sleep on one side

11:12.159 --> 11:14.720
One woke up and there were eight left

11:16.159 --> 11:17.440
Hello Mr. Zhu

11:17.840 --> 11:18.639
Hello

11:19.320 --> 11:20.600
I don’t know Mr. Zhu

11:21.120 --> 11:23.159
Is there any important information you want to tell me?

11:23.159 --> 11:23.720
Is such that

11:24.519 --> 11:26.200
I worked at J.P. Morgan Bank

11:26.200 --> 11:27.600
Research money printing technology

11:28.279 --> 11:30.480
A colleague of mine is a bronze sculptor

11:31.120 --> 11:32.799
Later we returned to China together

11:33.240 --> 11:34.559
One day more than three months ago

11:34.759 --> 11:36.240
He gave me a call

11:37.159 --> 11:37.879
explain

11:38.840 --> 11:40.480
Suspecting that I am being followed

11:41.600 --> 11:43.440
We lost contact after that

11:44.320 --> 11:45.519
until recently

11:45.679 --> 11:47.399
One day he suddenly found me

11:47.840 --> 11:49.480
Said he was kidnapped

11:50.159 --> 11:51.799
Imprisoned in an underground factory

11:52.399 --> 11:54.480
Forced to participate in counterfeiting legal tender

11:55.360 --> 11:56.919
Later he developed acute appendicitis

11:57.240 --> 11:58.720
Sent to hospital for treatment

11:58.720 --> 12:00.799
Only then did I find a chance to escape

12:02.000 --> 12:03.600
He asked me to help him leave Shanghai

12:03.840 --> 12:05.000
and warned me that

12:05.120 --> 12:07.159
Those people are also asking about my whereabouts

12:07.320 --> 12:08.720
Want me to be on guard

12:09.679 --> 12:10.919
I bought the ticket for him

12:11.360 --> 12:12.240
come home

12:12.879 --> 12:13.919
But he disappeared

12:15.480 --> 12:17.200
The house is a mess

12:17.720 --> 12:18.519
obviously

12:19.039 --> 12:20.399
The gang found him again

12:21.200 --> 12:22.600
and kidnapped him

12:23.159 --> 12:24.919
Then I found out I was being followed

12:26.000 --> 12:27.480
He was almost kidnapped

12:28.080 --> 12:29.519
I moved to the French Concession

12:31.000 --> 12:32.279
Capture him

12:32.559 --> 12:34.080
Do you know who he is?

12:34.960 --> 12:37.559
Special agent of the Military Section of the Japanese Army Ministry

12:37.960 --> 12:39.600
Where is that underground factory?

12:40.200 --> 12:40.960
have no idea

12:41.240 --> 12:42.399
He said he was kidnapped

12:42.600 --> 12:44.759
and on the way to the hospital

12:44.879 --> 12:45.960
blindfolded

12:46.399 --> 12:48.080
That car also drove around on purpose.

12:48.399 --> 12:49.919
He cannot judge the distance of a place

12:50.279 --> 12:51.200
I only know it's underground

12:51.200 --> 12:52.480
No sunshine all day long

12:53.159 --> 12:54.320
Work, food and accommodation

12:54.320 --> 12:55.440
It's all there

12:55.720 --> 12:57.720
How many people are there in total in this factory?

12:58.279 --> 12:59.279
There must be dozens of people

12:59.679 --> 13:00.679
Some do printing

13:01.200 --> 13:02.120
Making plates

13:02.120 --> 13:03.000
Making bronze sculptures

13:03.000 --> 13:03.679
Technical

13:04.519 --> 13:06.320
The equipment is also very complete

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Most of these people were kidnapped.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.399
As long as you don't cooperate at work

13:11.320 --> 13:13.080
Or you are incompetent at work

13:13.399 --> 13:14.480
will be executed

13:15.879 --> 13:18.440
He witnessed three people being executed on the spot

13:20.200 --> 13:21.639
In fact, my colleague

13:22.200 --> 13:23.440
He knows a little Japanese

13:24.840 --> 13:26.799
Once he overheard their conversation

13:27.799 --> 13:29.759
Talk about this operation of printing counterfeit banknotes

13:30.559 --> 13:31.799
called cedar plan

13:34.639 --> 13:35.759
cedar plan

13:41.600 --> 13:42.960
I heard that in addition to legal currency

13:43.840 --> 13:45.159
The Japanese are still trying to fake it

13:45.159 --> 13:46.919
Border currency issued by the CCP’s border areas

13:49.039 --> 13:50.600
Once counterfeit legal currency becomes widespread

13:51.600 --> 13:53.240
Not only the Chongqing government’s economic

13:53.240 --> 13:54.559
will be severely hit

13:55.360 --> 13:56.799
Even the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas

13:57.120 --> 13:59.080
Life will be even worse

14:02.320 --> 14:03.320
Strange

14:03.320 --> 14:05.559
Why don't you say it doesn't kick two knives?

14:06.840 --> 14:08.240
We have a good relationship

14:11.440 --> 14:12.120
Captain Zhao

14:12.399 --> 14:13.480
Does it still hurt you?

14:14.399 --> 14:16.200
I'll kick you, try it

14:42.600 --> 14:43.320
elder brother

14:44.679 --> 14:45.879
Don't shoot bro

14:46.320 --> 14:47.120
Turn around

14:50.440 --> 14:51.519
Don't shoot bro

14:52.279 --> 14:52.919
What are you doing?

14:52.919 --> 14:54.000
It's okay if you don't talk

14:55.600 --> 14:56.240
elder brother

14:57.080 --> 14:58.159
Calm down bro

15:01.440 --> 15:02.080
stop

15:03.720 --> 15:04.799
what do you do

15:05.440 --> 15:05.960
us

15:06.080 --> 15:07.200
We are from a horse farm

15:07.720 --> 15:09.120
Come and pull the feed

15:10.120 --> 15:11.720
Why did he call you Captain Zhao?

15:11.879 --> 15:13.559
The racecourse is divided into several teams

15:14.519 --> 15:16.120
I'm the captain of the feed team

15:25.159 --> 15:26.720
Keep doing your work

15:27.200 --> 15:28.519
Does anyone have any questions?

15:28.679 --> 15:30.000
Don't tell me here

15:30.039 --> 15:30.759
yes

15:30.960 --> 15:33.120
Don't worry, we're just here to do the work.

15:53.000 --> 15:53.720
brother

15:54.639 --> 15:56.519
Have you ever seen someone wearing a brown coat?

15:56.559 --> 15:57.840
People with injuries on their hands

15:58.039 --> 15:58.639
No

15:58.639 --> 16:00.399
we have been working

16:00.799 --> 16:02.240
I didn't see anyone passing by

16:02.720 --> 16:03.399
Thanks

16:55.639 --> 16:56.320
elder brother

16:57.399 --> 16:58.519
you betrayed me

16:58.600 --> 16:59.519
I don't

17:00.120 --> 17:01.919
I just said I didn't see anyone

17:13.839 --> 17:14.680
Shoot

17:16.319 --> 17:17.160
put the gun down

17:23.880 --> 17:24.960
put the gun down

17:27.880 --> 17:28.640
lay down

17:42.440 --> 17:43.880
Been chasing me for more than half a month

17:44.079 --> 17:45.920
When crossing the Pinghan-Han Railway

17:46.000 --> 17:47.640
I almost died in your hands

17:48.480 --> 17:49.799
you traitor

17:50.279 --> 17:51.319
you guys

17:51.599 --> 17:53.200
Just too merciful

17:54.039 --> 17:55.240
Nothing big can happen

17:55.440 --> 17:56.240
Shoot

17:56.880 --> 17:57.720
kill me

17:58.079 --> 17:59.359
You can't escape either

18:07.079 --> 18:08.279
Who are they?

18:08.920 --> 18:10.200
Anti-Japanese elements

18:10.359 --> 18:11.880
Should we take them back?

18:24.359 --> 18:25.119
Injured brother

18:28.240 --> 18:28.519
sorry

18:28.519 --> 18:29.200
elder brother

18:29.880 --> 18:31.039
I almost got you in trouble

18:31.559 --> 18:32.759
We're fine

18:33.039 --> 18:34.440
You're seriously injured

18:34.599 --> 18:35.920
Still bleeding

18:36.039 --> 18:37.160
The bullet is still inside

18:37.160 --> 18:38.480
I need to go to the hospital.

18:39.519 --> 18:40.640
I can't go to the hospital

18:41.359 --> 18:43.400
Are you from Chongqing or Yan'an?

18:47.480 --> 18:48.759
I'm just a Chinese

18:49.119 --> 18:50.599
I asked a little too much

18:50.680 --> 18:52.039
We are also Chinese

18:52.440 --> 18:53.200
trunk

18:53.720 --> 18:56.039
Isn't your cousin in a private clinic?

18:56.359 --> 18:56.920
right

18:57.279 --> 18:58.440
My cousin is very skilled in medicine

18:58.440 --> 18:59.960
Can help you take out the bullet

19:00.000 --> 19:00.599
right

19:01.240 --> 19:02.119
Do not bother

19:03.119 --> 19:04.359
Get the stool quickly

19:04.440 --> 19:05.160
elder brother

19:05.599 --> 19:06.400
Hurry up

19:07.759 --> 19:08.359
sit

19:09.880 --> 19:10.839
you saved our lives

19:10.839 --> 19:12.359
We learned that a favor was repaid

19:12.440 --> 19:13.839
You are hurt so badly now

19:13.920 --> 19:16.279
If you don't have surgery, your life will be gone.

19:17.440 --> 19:18.200
real

19:20.079 --> 19:20.880
Is it far

19:21.160 --> 19:22.200
Far but not far

19:22.200 --> 19:24.200
But I don’t want to tell my cousin first.

19:24.279 --> 19:25.079
I think it works

19:25.279 --> 19:26.400
You go to your cousin first

19:26.400 --> 19:28.640
Let him send the other patients away first

19:30.119 --> 19:31.799
What do you call me brother?

19:33.599 --> 19:34.720
Call me Lao Tian

19:34.799 --> 19:35.680
Brother Tian

19:36.079 --> 19:37.039
You call me Xiao Zhao

19:37.119 --> 19:38.119
His name is Trunk

19:38.400 --> 19:39.759
You have difficulty moving now

19:40.160 --> 19:40.880
Take my carriage

19:40.880 --> 19:42.359
I pull you over slowly

19:42.359 --> 19:42.720
trunk

19:42.720 --> 19:43.960
You go now

19:44.240 --> 19:44.920
Go to your brother's place

19:44.920 --> 19:46.599
Arrangements have been made to come and greet us.

19:46.920 --> 19:47.240
OK

19:47.240 --> 19:48.200
Brother Tian

19:50.720 --> 19:51.640
Believe me

19:57.279 --> 19:58.079
But

19:59.440 --> 20:01.480
Is there anyone who loves him more than me?

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
how long have you been together

20:06.359 --> 20:08.000
do you love him very much

20:08.960 --> 20:09.759
Miss Hanlu

20:13.480 --> 20:14.119
you

20:15.440 --> 20:17.079
But haven't you already

20:20.720 --> 20:21.559
terribly sorry

20:22.319 --> 20:24.160
Shouldn't appear like this

20:25.119 --> 20:25.640
No

20:26.200 --> 20:27.519
I'm the one who should be sorry

20:28.519 --> 20:30.640
I'm glad that Mr. Yamashita is still alive.

20:31.440 --> 20:33.000
But I just behaved

20:33.279 --> 20:34.559
But so rude

20:36.599 --> 20:37.559
do you know

20:38.119 --> 20:39.519
when people are dying

20:40.079 --> 20:42.000
Will see myself without the body

20:42.400 --> 20:43.359
that moment

20:43.759 --> 20:45.319
I really saw myself

20:46.319 --> 20:47.599
if i can survive

20:48.480 --> 20:50.000
I must start over

20:50.599 --> 20:51.640
My life

20:53.119 --> 20:55.119
You must have been seriously injured at the time

20:55.119 --> 20:57.960
Two-thirds of my lung was removed

20:58.400 --> 21:01.279
I can no longer be a soldier

21:05.759 --> 21:07.759
So Mr. Yamashita is now

21:08.160 --> 21:10.720
I am an ordinary businessman now

21:11.039 --> 21:12.119
i love movies

21:12.839 --> 21:14.880
This beautiful flower moon

21:15.160 --> 21:17.119
This is the first movie I invested in

21:18.079 --> 21:20.519
Ms. Hanlu joins the team

21:20.799 --> 21:21.759
I believe

21:22.279 --> 21:23.920
will be a great success

21:25.359 --> 21:27.680
It turns out that you invested in this movie

21:28.400 --> 21:30.160
No wonder it looks like willow

21:30.160 --> 21:32.240
Big stars like Chen Juanjuan

21:32.720 --> 21:34.240
Everyone is willing to play some small roles

21:34.559 --> 21:36.640
Compared with Miss Hanlu

21:37.119 --> 21:39.000
They are only suitable for small roles

21:42.119 --> 21:42.920
where

21:44.400 --> 21:46.480
My career has stalled for the most part

21:47.599 --> 21:49.359
The audience almost forgot about me

21:52.599 --> 21:53.279
but

21:53.799 --> 21:55.240
i will never forget you

21:57.720 --> 21:58.799
but I

22:00.799 --> 22:01.920
Mr. Yamashita

22:07.079 --> 22:07.960
Mr. Yamashita

22:08.480 --> 22:10.920
I think you should also know

22:12.440 --> 22:13.880
I already feel like I belong

22:15.200 --> 22:16.599
you mean

22:17.480 --> 22:18.440
Mr. Jiang

22:38.119 --> 22:39.599
Although I do

22:40.279 --> 22:42.480
It’s not what a gentleman does

22:43.480 --> 22:45.279
But I really can't bear it

22:45.839 --> 22:47.319
See Miss Hanlu again

22:48.319 --> 22:49.599
be deceived again

22:49.920 --> 22:52.359
My sincerity has been let down again

23:00.519 --> 23:02.759
I believe in tomorrow's drama

23:03.200 --> 23:04.480
will be more exciting

23:06.960 --> 23:07.680
That

23:08.200 --> 23:09.720
I'll take my leave first

23:30.200 --> 23:31.039
How's the injury?

23:31.599 --> 23:32.920
Fortunately, no artery was injured.

23:33.440 --> 23:34.799
Arrange surgery as soon as possible

23:35.039 --> 23:35.640
good

23:39.079 --> 23:39.839
Brother Tian

23:40.319 --> 23:41.319
Here is Dr. Han

23:41.319 --> 23:41.839
rest assured

24:04.799 --> 24:05.720
Have you explained everything?

24:06.039 --> 24:07.480
Don't worry, I've explained it.

24:08.240 --> 24:09.559
Doctor Han is our informant

24:09.559 --> 24:10.480
absolutely reliable

24:11.279 --> 24:11.960
team leader

24:12.559 --> 24:14.279
Who is this Lao Tian?

24:15.359 --> 24:16.359
of the Chinese Communist Party

24:16.839 --> 24:18.000
How did you know

24:18.640 --> 24:21.440
Do you remember the man in the coffee coat?

24:21.599 --> 24:22.839
Say to Lao Tian

24:23.319 --> 24:24.720
When passing the Pinghan Railway

24:24.720 --> 24:26.519
I almost died at the hands of Lao Tian

24:26.960 --> 24:28.920
Maybe they came from Yan'an

24:29.240 --> 24:32.119
The Pinghan-Hankou Railway is the only way to go

24:32.640 --> 24:33.759
Makes sense

24:34.920 --> 24:36.559
Nao Tian said that the coffee jacket is a traitor

24:36.559 --> 24:37.599
what's going on

24:37.680 --> 24:39.799
I guess it’s an internal campaign by the Chinese Communist Party.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.160
Chased all the way here

24:42.160 --> 24:43.079
Then why don't we

24:43.079 --> 24:44.480
Just take him back for interrogation.

24:44.559 --> 24:46.839
Can you please give me some ideas?

24:49.000 --> 24:51.599
The CCP has extremely hidden communication lines in Shanghai

24:51.920 --> 24:53.480
Lao Tian is injured now

24:53.880 --> 24:55.160
He let the traitor escape again

24:55.240 --> 24:57.119
He will definitely contact their people

24:58.119 --> 25:00.079
We must not alert the enemy

25:00.440 --> 25:01.799
Zhangji trap setting

25:02.200 --> 25:03.759
Only then can we defeat the Hulao Dragon

25:04.160 --> 25:05.000
Understood

25:05.240 --> 25:05.839
Walk

25:10.519 --> 25:10.839
team leader

25:10.839 --> 25:11.440
Slow down

25:28.480 --> 25:29.680
This person's name is Magpie

25:29.759 --> 25:32.119
He's a lurker we planted in Yan'an

25:32.279 --> 25:33.119
Recently arrived in Shanghai

25:33.119 --> 25:34.000
But his whereabouts are unknown

25:34.079 --> 25:35.200
Gotta find him

25:37.160 --> 25:38.480
Why are we in Yan'an?

25:38.480 --> 25:39.759
Place latent personnel

25:40.000 --> 25:41.200
Don't ask so many questions

25:42.640 --> 25:43.920
Don't ask anything

25:44.400 --> 25:46.640
There must be many ulterior conspiracies.

25:47.359 --> 25:48.480
What did you say

25:49.200 --> 25:50.000
nothing

25:50.160 --> 25:51.039
Also

25:51.599 --> 25:52.519
Just a clue

25:53.559 --> 25:54.799
He has a lover in Shanghai

25:54.799 --> 25:55.720
Called Cai Hongling

25:56.599 --> 25:58.119
She's a dancer at Xian Lesi Ballroom

25:58.519 --> 25:59.839
You have to find a way to get to her

26:02.920 --> 26:04.599
What is the purpose of looking for magpies?

26:05.599 --> 26:07.240
He has something important in his hand

26:09.119 --> 26:10.039
what

26:17.519 --> 26:18.039
Hello

26:18.720 --> 26:19.799
Mr. Chen

26:20.079 --> 26:21.000
Hello

26:22.200 --> 26:22.920
Miss Hanlu

26:23.000 --> 26:23.680
hello

26:23.920 --> 26:26.440
I called just to ask.

26:27.599 --> 26:29.759
Is Mr. Chen free tomorrow morning?

26:31.240 --> 26:32.039
should have

26:32.319 --> 26:33.079
What's up

26:34.200 --> 26:35.240
some things

26:36.640 --> 26:38.519
I would like to ask Mr. Chen for a favor

26:39.480 --> 26:40.960
Is it about the fan association again?

26:42.519 --> 26:43.200
Roughly the same

26:43.400 --> 26:43.920
OK

26:44.160 --> 26:45.640
So where shall we meet?

26:47.000 --> 26:48.480
You can come directly to my house

26:49.920 --> 26:51.319
Go to Miss Hanlu’s house

26:51.680 --> 26:53.559
You won't be photographed by tabloid reporters, right?

26:53.640 --> 26:55.599
Then I can't explain it to my wife.

26:56.240 --> 26:57.319
can you come

26:57.680 --> 26:58.920
I feel relieved

27:00.160 --> 27:01.440
some things

27:02.720 --> 27:04.759
I don't want someone I hate to do it.

27:05.880 --> 27:06.920
Miss Hanlu's voice

27:06.920 --> 27:08.440
It sounds a little hoarse

27:13.200 --> 27:14.720
Maybe I've been too tired recently

27:16.720 --> 27:17.839
That's settled

27:19.880 --> 27:20.960
tomorrow morning

27:23.079 --> 27:24.480
I will definitely be at home

27:25.559 --> 27:26.039
good

27:26.039 --> 27:26.920
See you or leave

27:46.440 --> 27:47.720
some things

27:48.319 --> 27:50.240
I don't want someone I hate to do it.

27:51.480 --> 27:52.680
tomorrow morning

27:53.799 --> 27:55.319
I will definitely be at home

27:55.559 --> 27:57.440
why did she say that

28:17.440 --> 28:18.480
Miss Hanlu

28:33.119 --> 28:33.960
Miss Hanlu

28:51.319 --> 28:51.759
I’m off duty

28:52.000 --> 28:53.920
Don’t you know I’m number 76?

28:54.440 --> 28:55.920
Tell me to get off work

29:04.799 --> 29:05.480
correct

29:06.119 --> 29:06.640
recently

29:06.640 --> 29:08.599
Do you have any suspicious people here?

29:08.920 --> 29:09.559
No

29:10.000 --> 29:11.599
valuable information now

29:11.839 --> 29:13.240
The reward is double

29:13.440 --> 29:16.240
You, the informants, are the most profitable now.

29:16.759 --> 29:17.880
I don’t even want to do it anymore

29:20.880 --> 29:22.240
You can be an informant

29:40.079 --> 29:40.839
Captain Zhao?

29:41.559 --> 29:43.640
That old Tian seems to be suspicious.

29:44.799 --> 29:45.759
what happened

29:46.680 --> 29:47.680
Where is he now?

29:48.279 --> 29:49.279
Still upstairs

29:50.599 --> 29:52.079
You stabilize him first

29:52.279 --> 29:53.400
I'll be here in a minute

29:54.000 --> 29:54.559
good

29:55.240 --> 29:55.880
wait

29:56.599 --> 29:57.599
Notify the gendarmerie

29:57.920 --> 29:58.680
Why

29:58.799 --> 29:59.400
Leave it alone

29:59.400 --> 30:00.880
I asked you to notify the gendarmerie

30:01.359 --> 30:01.960
yes

30:41.839 --> 30:42.599
Laotian

30:43.680 --> 30:44.599
Laotian

30:45.279 --> 30:46.079
Laotian

31:10.759 --> 31:11.400
Who is it?

31:12.799 --> 31:13.519
play high

31:16.480 --> 31:17.279
play high

31:18.759 --> 31:20.000
Is something wrong at this late hour?

31:20.559 --> 31:21.799
I'm here to say goodbye to you

31:22.920 --> 31:23.759
Say goodbye

31:25.839 --> 31:26.880
Come in and talk

31:34.079 --> 31:35.039
Been here before

31:36.559 --> 31:37.480
First time here

31:39.759 --> 31:40.880
you want to ask me

31:41.000 --> 31:42.400
How do you know you live here?

31:44.319 --> 31:45.720
I didn’t know until you came, too.

31:47.119 --> 31:47.759
Where is Chen Jiaping?

31:48.240 --> 31:49.000
Not at home?

31:49.319 --> 31:49.960
Working overtime

31:49.960 --> 31:50.920
Coming back soon

31:52.000 --> 31:52.640
you sit

31:53.720 --> 31:54.880
We don’t have any coffee powder at home

31:55.000 --> 31:56.160
Let me get you a cup of tea

31:56.720 --> 31:57.119
no, I'm fine

31:57.599 --> 31:58.960
I'll leave after saying a few words to you

32:07.680 --> 32:09.640
I'm leaving Taihe Trading Company

32:11.359 --> 32:12.039
Why

32:12.200 --> 32:13.039
in Shanghai

32:13.279 --> 32:15.519
There's a reclusive British communications expert

32:15.519 --> 32:17.200
Eisen Meyer

32:17.799 --> 32:19.319
I visited him some time ago

32:19.359 --> 32:20.519
He quite appreciates me

32:20.680 --> 32:22.319
And he promised

32:22.319 --> 32:24.319
If I stop doing things for the Japanese

32:24.319 --> 32:25.640
He accepted me as his disciple

32:26.359 --> 32:28.160
The salary level and everything are pretty good.

32:28.640 --> 32:29.559
I'm quite interested

32:31.240 --> 32:32.880
But our business

32:33.160 --> 32:35.319
You can't leave if you want to, right?

32:39.319 --> 32:40.559
I submitted my application

32:41.000 --> 32:42.839
I want to go back and take care of my seriously ill grandma

32:43.240 --> 32:45.720
And I deliberately in my recent work

32:45.920 --> 32:47.119
Showing no results

32:47.400 --> 32:48.240
Make mistakes frequently

32:48.680 --> 32:50.000
They probably think I'm a loser

32:50.319 --> 32:51.039
Of no use

32:51.640 --> 32:52.839
For this reason

32:53.000 --> 32:54.400
Can they let you go easily?

32:54.960 --> 32:56.240
The nature of my job

32:56.519 --> 32:58.799
It stands to reason that it's not that easy

32:59.559 --> 33:00.599
but you know

33:00.680 --> 33:01.480
People want to leave

33:01.559 --> 33:02.680
Who can keep it?

33:03.480 --> 33:05.240
And I checked it up and down

33:05.319 --> 33:06.279
There was some blood

33:07.559 --> 33:08.440
These days

33:08.519 --> 33:10.279
Nothing can be done without spending money

33:13.920 --> 33:14.920
Actually

33:15.160 --> 33:17.680
I already thought that place was not suitable for you

33:19.400 --> 33:20.200
fine

33:20.640 --> 33:22.680
Learn techniques from British experts

33:22.759 --> 33:23.680
happy for you

33:24.480 --> 33:26.759
I also look forward to seeing a better you

33:29.079 --> 33:29.720
Thanks

33:33.480 --> 33:34.640
otherwise

33:35.400 --> 33:36.519
Let me be your brother

33:38.079 --> 33:38.799
Okay

33:39.440 --> 33:40.920
Such an excellent brother

33:40.920 --> 33:41.720
Who does not like

33:43.680 --> 33:44.200
OK

33:44.519 --> 33:45.559
Then we've settled

33:46.880 --> 33:48.160
Sister, I'm leaving

33:48.359 --> 33:49.400
How can I contact you in the future?

33:50.000 --> 33:50.599
rest assured

33:50.680 --> 33:51.720
I won't go too far

33:52.200 --> 33:53.559
I still want to protect you

34:01.640 --> 34:02.640
By the way, sister

34:59.719 --> 35:00.239
That's it

35:00.239 --> 35:01.159
Search

35:01.679 --> 35:02.719
gendarmerie

35:03.159 --> 35:04.679
He just called the gendarmerie

35:05.000 --> 35:05.760
you killed their people

35:05.760 --> 35:07.159
They won't let you go

35:07.239 --> 35:08.119
You go quickly

35:08.119 --> 35:08.760
leave me alone

35:08.760 --> 35:09.599
Brother Tian

35:09.599 --> 35:11.159
I brought you here

35:11.159 --> 35:12.400
Almost killed you

35:12.440 --> 35:13.760
If I leave by myself

35:13.760 --> 35:15.199
Am I still Chinese?

35:15.199 --> 35:15.920
Walk

35:26.880 --> 35:27.639
Search

35:38.320 --> 35:40.039
Leave the scene to other departments for investigation

35:40.119 --> 35:40.840
Walk

36:15.559 --> 36:16.559
Brother Tian

36:18.039 --> 36:19.719
Come and stay at my house tonight

36:20.840 --> 36:21.599
No more

36:22.320 --> 36:23.800
I can't trouble you anymore

36:26.440 --> 36:28.800
I know something like this happened

36:29.559 --> 36:31.360
You won't believe me

36:32.480 --> 36:33.880
I'm just worried

36:34.280 --> 36:36.119
You are very weak now

36:41.920 --> 36:43.199
You are familiar with this place

36:44.440 --> 36:46.119
Can you help me find a hotel first?

36:46.280 --> 36:47.400
Let's talk about staying here

36:48.280 --> 36:49.199
no problem

37:17.280 --> 37:18.199
Jiaping

37:23.760 --> 37:24.639
you're awake

37:26.480 --> 37:28.239
You stayed with me all night

37:30.880 --> 37:31.920
I'm thinking

37:32.280 --> 37:33.679
if you wake up

37:33.880 --> 37:35.519
Found no one there

37:36.480 --> 37:38.360
in this empty room

37:38.559 --> 37:39.960
Then I really don’t know

37:40.039 --> 37:42.239
Is it heaven or earth?

37:42.960 --> 37:44.960
I wish this was heaven

37:47.159 --> 37:48.840
But I don’t want you here

37:49.559 --> 37:50.800
Then don't you think

37:51.679 --> 37:52.719
no matter it's me

37:53.159 --> 37:54.039
still you

37:55.000 --> 37:56.320
Shouldn't they all be here?

37:58.960 --> 38:01.079
You must think I'm stupid, right?

38:03.239 --> 38:04.239
Actually

38:06.280 --> 38:08.079
There are many ups and downs in life

38:09.519 --> 38:11.679
Some hurdles are really difficult to pass

38:12.320 --> 38:14.039
But in this way you

38:14.199 --> 38:16.960
I went through this hurdle personally.

38:17.320 --> 38:18.960
Although it's a bit more tragic

38:19.760 --> 38:20.920
But it's worth it

38:25.400 --> 38:26.719
Why don't you go back quickly?

38:28.280 --> 38:30.519
If the man I love leaves me

38:31.119 --> 38:33.559
But he stayed out all night with another woman

38:34.000 --> 38:35.519
I have to kill him

38:35.760 --> 38:38.639
Then do you think she won't do this?

38:42.599 --> 38:44.320
Even though you say so

38:45.960 --> 38:48.199
But actually I know you love each other very much

38:50.639 --> 38:51.760
I really envy you

39:01.400 --> 39:02.760
It's so quiet now

39:05.280 --> 39:07.760
Just like the silence before the war broke out

39:10.000 --> 39:10.800
Next

39:12.400 --> 39:14.880
I have to face the swarm of reporters

39:16.440 --> 39:18.239
Take me as the director who asked

39:18.960 --> 39:20.239
Producer

39:21.000 --> 39:22.360
movie studio owner

39:23.360 --> 39:24.599
When I think of these

39:25.199 --> 39:27.039
Might as well continue to stay here

39:28.400 --> 39:29.239
That

39:31.679 --> 39:33.320
Just think about one more thing

39:35.079 --> 39:37.679
I still have to face my lovely wife

39:40.239 --> 39:42.360
I have a feeling you'll be fine

39:42.719 --> 39:43.960
Go back quickly

39:47.920 --> 39:49.880
I won't do stupid things again

40:03.000 --> 40:03.679
Captain Zhao

40:03.920 --> 40:04.960
as you would expect

40:05.239 --> 40:07.079
Lao Tian changed to a hotel early in the morning

40:07.559 --> 40:08.480
Are you tracking?

40:08.480 --> 40:09.119
Followed

40:09.320 --> 40:11.719
He moved to the Chang Lai Hotel three streets away.

40:13.440 --> 40:14.039
team leader

40:14.360 --> 40:16.760
You said you went through so much effort to save him yesterday

40:16.840 --> 40:18.679
Why does he still not trust you?

40:19.559 --> 40:22.320
I didn't save him just to make him believe in me.

40:22.559 --> 40:23.920
Even if he believes me

40:24.519 --> 40:26.760
He won't let me know his whereabouts

40:26.880 --> 40:29.079
I know the people of the CCP very well

40:29.599 --> 40:31.119
Very cunning

40:34.760 --> 40:36.519
Then why are we saving him?

40:37.119 --> 40:38.480
Follow the clues

40:39.280 --> 40:40.800
Doctor Han is dead now

40:41.079 --> 40:42.679
The clues to find him are gone

40:43.199 --> 40:46.159
Then he will think that the danger has been removed

40:46.719 --> 40:48.400
Will wait for the opportunity

40:49.039 --> 40:50.000
Then I'll arrange someone

40:50.000 --> 40:51.559
Follow him every step of the way

40:51.920 --> 40:52.639
remember

40:53.119 --> 40:54.159
follow him

40:54.400 --> 40:56.480
Have to change someone every half hour

40:56.639 --> 40:57.719
cannot be repeated

40:58.199 --> 40:58.840
clear

41:06.880 --> 41:09.320
After my two days of observation and research,

41:10.000 --> 41:12.519
I discovered that adzuki beans cannot eat leguminous grasses

41:13.519 --> 41:14.800
Look at this shit

41:15.360 --> 41:17.199
Severe indigestion

41:20.440 --> 41:21.719
I know Xiaodouzi

41:22.400 --> 41:23.559
Just feel sick to your stomach

41:23.679 --> 41:24.800
Feeling depressed

41:25.199 --> 41:27.440
When you feel depressed, life will not be happy.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.480
It seems that it is better to eat alfalfa in the future.

41:34.039 --> 41:36.239
I said you really use yourself as a stable driver.

41:37.199 --> 41:39.199
This is what I call doing what I do and loving what I do.

41:39.599 --> 41:40.840
You know shit

41:45.800 --> 41:46.440
team leader

41:48.639 --> 41:49.360
team leader

41:55.239 --> 41:56.119
how's it going
