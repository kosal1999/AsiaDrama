01:33.680 --> 01:35.159
Without a passport,

01:35.159 --> 01:37.640
and attempted to bribe the public servants

01:37.640 --> 01:39.680
I suspect you are scheming

01:39.680 --> 01:40.879
engage in illegal activities

01:40.879 --> 01:41.319
come!

01:42.519 --> 01:43.599
Bring them down.

01:43.599 --> 01:44.159
Search them.

01:46.280 --> 01:46.920
Get down. Come down.

01:46.920 --> 01:47.480
Come down.

01:57.439 --> 01:58.359
Two knives have been found.

02:00.079 --> 02:00.879
Captain Zhao,

02:01.280 --> 02:04.079
and brought an unregistered firearm.

02:04.079 --> 02:05.239
You are doubly guilty

02:06.560 --> 02:07.519
detective

02:08.520 --> 02:09.680
you know my job

02:10.159 --> 02:11.439
It's for self-defense

02:11.439 --> 02:13.400
we never cause trouble in the concession.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.039
Captain Zhao,

02:14.039 --> 02:15.319
you don't know anything?

02:15.319 --> 02:17.680
French Concession is flooded with guns recently

02:17.680 --> 02:19.240
many murders recently.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.800
Wen Wei Wei's Evening News,

02:20.800 --> 02:22.199
got thrown by hand grenades.

02:22.199 --> 02:23.360
How come you brought so many weapons?

02:23.360 --> 02:24.919
How can you say that you're not here to make trouble?

02:24.919 --> 02:26.240
It was done by No. 76.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.879
It has nothing to do with us.

02:27.879 --> 02:28.840
I'm a businessman.

02:28.840 --> 02:30.240
I can do small business.

02:30.240 --> 02:31.039
For business.

02:31.039 --> 02:32.120
That won't be a problem.

02:32.120 --> 02:32.479
Come with me

02:32.479 --> 02:34.120
come with me to the police station to register

02:34.120 --> 02:35.680
you can get a passport

02:38.439 --> 02:39.599
It's urgent.

02:41.039 --> 02:42.719
Just a excuse.

02:42.719 --> 02:44.520
You'll need me next time.

02:44.639 --> 02:45.680
Make an exception.

02:48.520 --> 02:49.120
Thank you.

02:49.280 --> 02:49.879
Alright.

02:49.879 --> 02:50.479
Thanks.

02:50.560 --> 02:51.360
Brothers.

02:51.360 --> 02:52.759
Listen up, I'll tell you.

02:53.280 --> 02:55.599
This is my good buddy.

02:55.599 --> 02:57.599
Don't handcuff them later.

02:57.599 --> 02:58.319
Got it?

02:58.319 --> 02:58.759
Got it.

02:59.759 --> 03:00.639
You are accommodating enough?

03:01.919 --> 03:02.680
Take her away.

03:03.000 --> 03:03.520
Just go.

03:03.520 --> 03:04.319
I'll leave on my own.

03:05.319 --> 03:05.840
Come on.

03:12.840 --> 03:13.960
Take them inside.

03:15.199 --> 03:15.840
Hello

03:15.840 --> 03:16.759
sheriff Clement.

03:19.840 --> 03:20.479
Come on.

03:21.400 --> 03:21.919
Brother.

03:22.719 --> 03:24.840
I think I've seen this foreigner before.

03:32.719 --> 03:33.560
Come to register.

03:37.280 --> 03:38.319
Whose dagger is it?

03:38.879 --> 03:39.439
It's mine.

03:39.800 --> 03:40.840
What's your name?

03:40.840 --> 03:41.639
Two Swords.

03:43.560 --> 03:44.719
Wang Hanlong!

03:47.159 --> 03:47.800
Where's the spear?

03:48.039 --> 03:48.719
Zhao An.

03:51.759 --> 03:52.400
Captain Zhao.

03:53.080 --> 03:53.680
Your bag.

03:54.759 --> 03:55.759
There are personal letters inside.

03:55.759 --> 03:56.879
Please take them.

03:58.120 --> 04:00.759
This place is much safer than a bank.

04:00.759 --> 04:01.599
Don't worry.

04:04.560 --> 04:05.240
Hurry up!

04:05.840 --> 04:07.400
Take you to the detention room.

04:07.759 --> 04:08.840
Go, please.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.360
Watch this.

04:24.879 --> 04:25.680
Where's the tag?

04:47.040 --> 04:47.680
Why are you pushing me?

04:47.680 --> 04:48.680
Are you out of your mind?

05:10.000 --> 05:10.519
Here you are.

05:10.920 --> 05:11.519
Great.

05:13.120 --> 05:13.639
This is broken.

05:14.439 --> 05:15.800
This is sealed with pewter wax.

05:16.120 --> 05:17.000
How long will it take?

05:17.720 --> 05:20.879
Melt and take photos before cooling.

05:21.279 --> 05:22.360
40 to 50 minutes.

05:23.480 --> 05:24.959
I can hang on for 30 minutes at most.

05:24.959 --> 05:25.519
Do it as soon as possible.

05:53.199 --> 05:53.959
Captain Zhao.

05:54.560 --> 05:55.279
To fill out this form.

05:55.279 --> 05:56.040
And after that,

05:56.040 --> 05:56.639
you can leave with a seal

05:56.879 --> 05:57.480
and you can leave.

05:57.480 --> 05:58.160
Come on.

06:03.079 --> 06:03.959
What do you mean?

06:03.959 --> 06:04.839
Where is the pen?

06:06.279 --> 06:06.920
A pen.

06:08.480 --> 06:09.079
Pens?

06:11.160 --> 06:12.199
You didn't bring any pens?

06:12.199 --> 06:13.759
You've collected the things

06:31.639 --> 06:32.759
oh, Detective Ye

06:32.759 --> 06:34.600
don't you have any pens?

06:35.160 --> 06:35.879
Sorry about that.

06:36.439 --> 06:37.160
Then...

06:38.360 --> 06:39.199
What should we do?

06:40.480 --> 06:41.560
I'll go and find you

06:41.560 --> 06:42.480
thank you for your hard work.

06:42.720 --> 06:43.759
Serving the public

06:44.000 --> 06:44.519
hurry up!

06:47.560 --> 06:48.240
Captain Zhao.

06:48.240 --> 06:49.000
Hold on.

07:09.519 --> 07:10.240
Captain Zhao.

07:22.360 --> 07:23.160
What do you mean?

07:23.160 --> 07:23.800
Where is the water?

07:23.800 --> 07:24.600
Water?

07:24.600 --> 07:25.439
There's no water.

07:25.879 --> 07:26.920
There's no water.

07:28.199 --> 07:29.680
We had water in the morning.

07:31.959 --> 07:32.759
We really ran out of water.

07:38.839 --> 07:40.560
There was still water in the morning.

07:45.319 --> 07:46.839
Stop it.

07:46.839 --> 07:48.000
There's only one pen.

07:48.439 --> 07:49.519
Wait. That's impossible.

07:49.759 --> 07:50.639
There must be water.

07:51.480 --> 07:52.720
Get another pen.

07:56.480 --> 07:57.720
Get another pen.

07:59.199 --> 08:00.519
Get a few more pens.

08:02.399 --> 08:03.079
Pens and caps.

08:06.240 --> 08:06.800
Thank you.

08:07.319 --> 08:08.199
Captain Zhao.

08:08.199 --> 08:08.839
Hold on.

08:11.720 --> 08:13.079
What kind of pen is this?

08:13.079 --> 08:14.079
That's right.

08:14.399 --> 08:15.560
What pen?

08:51.519 --> 08:52.879
I'm sure it's good this time.

09:32.600 --> 09:33.600
Hurry up.

09:38.080 --> 09:39.159
There, there.

09:44.519 --> 09:45.159
This...

09:45.440 --> 09:46.240
Detective

09:47.080 --> 09:48.759
this is not something we should fill out

09:54.960 --> 09:57.320
aren't you going to stay in French Concession temporarily?

09:57.600 --> 09:58.759
Who's staying here?

09:59.519 --> 10:01.080
Why are we staying here?

10:01.639 --> 10:02.480
Detective

10:02.759 --> 10:03.799
just passed by?

10:04.039 --> 10:05.679
Just passed by in 20 minutes.

10:05.679 --> 10:06.639
Just passing by.

10:06.639 --> 10:07.879
Just 20 minutes?

10:07.879 --> 10:09.000
Just 20 minutes?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.080
Please, please.

10:10.080 --> 10:11.440
It's okay if you don't want to stay.

10:11.720 --> 10:12.200
There's something wrong.

10:12.200 --> 10:12.840
Sorry.

10:13.320 --> 10:14.480
Don't fill this out.

10:14.759 --> 10:16.440
I'll get a stamp from the traffic department

10:16.799 --> 10:17.840
and get a seal on it.

10:18.279 --> 10:20.639
Stop being embarrassing, okay?

10:20.639 --> 10:22.360
Can you hurry up?

10:46.039 --> 10:46.519
Brother.

10:46.519 --> 10:47.120
Scram!

10:47.360 --> 10:48.919
Stop pacing in front of me.

10:53.399 --> 10:54.039
Alright?

10:54.039 --> 10:54.600
All right.

10:54.600 --> 10:55.960
Alright?

10:55.960 --> 10:56.480
Scram!

10:56.480 --> 10:56.720
Chief.

10:56.720 --> 10:57.320
Hold on.

10:57.320 --> 10:57.600
What?

10:57.600 --> 10:59.159
-Don't touch me, right? -Is that enough?

10:59.159 --> 11:00.159
Alright, alright.

11:00.159 --> 11:01.159
Don't talk to me!

11:01.480 --> 11:02.720
Do you have guns?

11:03.039 --> 11:04.000
You just left?

11:04.000 --> 11:04.600
That's right.

11:04.600 --> 11:05.279
Captain Zhao. Leader Zhao.

11:05.279 --> 11:06.519
You reminded me, Captain Zhao.

11:06.519 --> 11:07.480
If you bring guns,

11:07.480 --> 11:08.759
you have to fill in

11:08.759 --> 11:11.120
weapons Permit Application Form. Captain Zhao.

11:11.120 --> 11:12.320
Do you think that's enough?

11:12.320 --> 11:13.000
Chief Zhao.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.080
Please wait.

11:14.639 --> 11:15.360
Wait!

11:22.120 --> 11:23.039
I'm running out of time.

11:23.039 --> 11:24.000
If this goes on,

11:24.480 --> 11:26.320
If we can't make it to the meeting,

11:26.919 --> 11:28.279
If we can't

11:28.279 --> 11:30.080
hand the file to Kimura,

11:30.080 --> 11:31.360
we will be dead.

11:31.919 --> 11:32.480
Please.

11:32.480 --> 11:33.320
It's not our brothers.

11:33.320 --> 11:34.559
It was you.

11:35.679 --> 11:36.320
Brother.

11:36.799 --> 11:38.480
Aren't you my younger brother?

11:38.480 --> 11:38.960
Tell me that

11:38.960 --> 11:39.480
Is he really my brother?

11:39.480 --> 11:40.279
That's right.

11:40.279 --> 11:41.120
If you deny it,

11:41.120 --> 11:42.120
I'll shoot you to death.

11:42.120 --> 11:42.799
It's my fault.

11:42.799 --> 11:43.919
That's right.

11:47.320 --> 11:48.039
Darn it!

12:16.879 --> 12:17.720
Captain Zhao.

12:18.440 --> 12:19.799
I followed the rules.

12:20.039 --> 12:21.159
Don't be angry with me.

12:22.399 --> 12:23.919
That's useless.

12:30.840 --> 12:31.759
Keep that in mind.

12:35.000 --> 12:35.399
Seal it

12:38.159 --> 12:38.639
on the ceremony.

12:40.000 --> 12:40.519
Almost done

13:09.639 --> 13:11.000
or is she really shy?

13:11.279 --> 13:12.240
This application form

13:12.240 --> 13:13.200
needs Chief Li's signature

13:13.200 --> 13:14.879
but Section Chief Li is not here

13:15.240 --> 13:16.120
you'll have to wait a bit.

13:16.360 --> 13:17.519
It'll be soon.

13:17.919 --> 13:18.519
Hold on.

13:20.919 --> 13:21.519
Brother.

13:24.080 --> 13:24.799
That's not right.

13:26.480 --> 13:27.840
Something is wrong with him.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.279
That's right.

13:30.639 --> 13:32.039
He's got serious problems.

13:32.639 --> 13:34.240
We're working for the Japanese,

13:34.240 --> 13:35.639
and he works for the French?

13:35.960 --> 13:37.639
Are all dogs.

13:37.639 --> 13:39.360
Why are you making things difficult for us?

13:44.080 --> 13:44.759
Brother,

13:46.080 --> 13:46.720
I remembered that

13:46.720 --> 13:48.360
where I met that foreigner.

13:53.240 --> 13:53.799
How is it?

13:54.600 --> 13:55.080
The horse is riding.

13:55.159 --> 13:56.279
They can't be suppressed.

13:56.279 --> 13:57.200
Waiting for it to cool down.

13:57.200 --> 13:57.919
A few minutes.

14:00.840 --> 14:01.960
This is the French Concession,

14:01.960 --> 14:02.559
you can't go in there

14:02.559 --> 14:03.840
get out of our way.

14:04.399 --> 14:05.080
Captain Zhao

14:05.840 --> 14:07.159
section Chief Li will be right back

14:07.159 --> 14:07.960
captain Zhao.

14:07.960 --> 14:08.960
Inspector Clermont.

14:08.960 --> 14:10.000
I'm from Taihe Trading Firm.

14:10.000 --> 14:10.679
You may not know me,

14:10.679 --> 14:11.799
but I know that

14:12.039 --> 14:13.960
you bought two boxes of opium ointment from me.

14:14.279 --> 14:15.840
Near the Archbishop Road.

14:15.840 --> 14:16.559
Do you remember that?

14:21.080 --> 14:21.919
Sheriff Clement.

14:22.279 --> 14:23.799
The man broke into the concession with a weapon

14:23.799 --> 14:24.919
I am going through the formalities for him.

14:30.240 --> 14:31.559
Close the door.

14:35.960 --> 14:36.440
Yes

15:10.600 --> 15:12.639
this is Captain Zhao.

15:12.639 --> 15:13.879
He is my good friend.

15:14.240 --> 15:15.440
You're mistaken

15:15.679 --> 15:17.960
return his things to him immediately.

15:17.960 --> 15:21.279
And send him back to the parking lot.

15:23.120 --> 15:23.720
Yes

15:24.360 --> 15:25.200
thank you, Clement.

15:29.679 --> 15:30.519
Sheriff Clermans.

15:30.840 --> 15:32.240
I'll get the car key in my room.

15:32.559 --> 15:34.639
Captain Zhao is in a rush.

15:34.639 --> 15:36.200
Drive my car.

15:36.200 --> 15:37.320
And help him clean it up.

15:37.320 --> 15:38.039
Come on.

15:45.399 --> 15:46.720
Take out my things.

15:47.360 --> 15:48.279
Hurry up!

15:48.279 --> 15:50.480
Return Captain Zhao's things to him.

15:52.720 --> 15:53.559
Thank you, Clement.

15:56.840 --> 15:57.279
Captain Zhao.

15:57.279 --> 15:58.080
Take a look

15:58.080 --> 16:00.000
are your things still there?

16:03.679 --> 16:04.159
They are.

16:08.399 --> 16:09.080
Captain Zhao.

16:09.399 --> 16:10.360
When were you early?

16:10.360 --> 16:10.720
Two o'clock.

16:10.720 --> 16:11.720
We'll be late. Let's go!

16:13.039 --> 16:13.480
Brother!

16:13.480 --> 16:14.200
Gun. Gun.

16:14.200 --> 16:16.200
It won't be as fast as my car.

16:47.200 --> 16:47.840
Hey!

16:48.159 --> 16:48.679
Here they are.

16:53.720 --> 16:54.360
Captain Zhao.

16:54.360 --> 16:55.120
Where's the car?

16:56.600 --> 16:57.639
Slowly.

16:58.279 --> 16:59.159
Can I drive?

16:59.440 --> 17:00.159
Captain Zhao.

17:00.159 --> 17:01.000
See you later.

17:01.000 --> 17:01.720
See you later.

17:01.720 --> 17:02.480
Captain Zhao.

17:18.720 --> 17:20.720
The bride's feet can't touch the ground.

17:20.720 --> 17:22.440
The groom has to carry the bride off the carriage.

17:24.319 --> 17:25.559
Good.

17:25.839 --> 17:26.799
I can carry everything.

17:27.319 --> 17:28.680
What do you mean by "carry everything"?

17:29.240 --> 17:30.480
As if I'm so fat.

17:32.160 --> 17:33.160
I didn't mean that.

17:33.720 --> 17:34.400
I was wrong.

17:34.880 --> 17:36.200
I hope my bride

17:36.200 --> 17:37.599
could give me a lifetime

17:37.839 --> 17:39.440
to make up for my mistakes.

17:42.240 --> 17:44.039
What are you doing?

17:44.519 --> 17:45.480
I want to hold you.

17:46.039 --> 17:47.240
And if I do not see your face

17:47.240 --> 17:48.759
If I don't see your face.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.079
From now on,

17:50.519 --> 17:52.440
I don't want to miss every expression on your face.

17:53.039 --> 17:54.000
I will share your happiness

17:54.720 --> 17:56.079
and sorrow,

17:56.599 --> 17:57.480
with you,

17:58.400 --> 17:59.839
and sorrow.

18:03.359 --> 18:04.319
Married!

18:45.720 --> 18:46.759
Have you got a plan?

18:47.079 --> 18:48.799
How do you plan to kill the warrior under the mountain?

18:50.079 --> 18:50.839
A serrated knife.

18:51.240 --> 18:53.880
The warrior will be killed with a serrated knife.

18:59.839 --> 19:00.920
What's the plan?

19:01.200 --> 19:01.960
Where is the knife hidden?

19:01.960 --> 19:03.200
When to start it.

19:03.200 --> 19:04.240
And how to evacuate later.

19:06.799 --> 19:07.680
Don't worry.

19:08.960 --> 19:10.119
I've arranged everything.

19:10.119 --> 19:11.480
After your operation is successful,

19:11.480 --> 19:12.519
go to Pier 16

19:12.519 --> 19:13.519
I'll wait for you there.

19:13.839 --> 19:15.200
I'll arrange the boat

19:15.200 --> 19:16.559
and send you to Jiaxing for temporary shelter.

19:19.440 --> 19:20.480
When you finish the mission,

19:20.480 --> 19:22.319
you can kill this traitor!

19:26.720 --> 19:27.359
Brother!

19:27.359 --> 19:28.240
Where's Kun?

19:29.319 --> 19:30.759
He's locked in the storage room on the second floor.

19:30.759 --> 19:32.039
There is a window there

19:32.039 --> 19:33.559
where you can overlook the whole scene.

19:34.200 --> 19:35.000
Take me there.

19:35.000 --> 19:35.640
Alright.

19:45.440 --> 19:46.440
When!

19:48.240 --> 19:49.920
Later you'll see

19:50.799 --> 19:52.200
your beloved woman

19:53.440 --> 19:55.319
Is going to marry another man.

19:55.839 --> 19:58.559
A traitor and dog you hate the most.

20:00.920 --> 20:01.799
It's fine.

20:04.039 --> 20:05.279
When you see it,

20:06.160 --> 20:08.440
you think about it if it's worth it?

20:09.400 --> 20:10.920
You protected

20:11.839 --> 20:14.279
to protect a woman

20:14.839 --> 20:17.359
a woman who betrayed your faith?

20:18.559 --> 20:19.720
To betray your people?

20:27.920 --> 20:28.720
The Commander below the mountain.

20:29.240 --> 20:31.559
Kun was taken to the wedding venue by us.

20:34.039 --> 20:36.759
If Kun and Zuo Shuangtao are together,

20:37.400 --> 20:40.279
left Shuangtao must have had contact with you at the scene.

20:40.480 --> 20:41.200
That's why...

20:42.160 --> 20:44.119
We've placed the snipers on the second floor

20:44.359 --> 20:45.799
keep an eye on Left Shuangtao at all times

20:46.240 --> 20:47.519
to make sure you're not in danger.

20:49.039 --> 20:51.599
You still need to be aware of

20:52.519 --> 20:54.000
for Shan Ren.

20:54.240 --> 20:56.079
That day.

20:56.079 --> 20:58.319
And there are reporters on the scene.

20:58.599 --> 21:01.079
It's a bad influence to us.

21:01.960 --> 21:05.000
Once we confirm that Left Shuangtao is the assassin,

21:05.960 --> 21:08.680
settle it after the wedding.

21:09.160 --> 21:09.640
Yes

21:12.839 --> 21:13.880
there's one thing.

21:14.559 --> 21:16.319
I don't know if you've heard.

21:17.440 --> 21:18.559
The Prime Minister of the Guards

21:19.319 --> 21:21.880
seeking peace talks with Chongqing.

21:23.000 --> 21:23.880
Peace talks?

21:26.160 --> 21:28.240
Chiang Kai-shek has retreated to Chongqing.

21:28.240 --> 21:29.440
He can't compete with us at all.

21:29.839 --> 21:31.920
We can negotiate under such circumstances.

21:32.480 --> 21:35.200
If we want to continue our war in East Asia,

21:35.440 --> 21:38.000
and then a war against the US will be inevitable.

21:38.240 --> 21:40.680
The Prime Minister is under pressure

21:41.039 --> 21:43.440
to end the East Asian War as soon as possible

21:43.440 --> 21:45.759
and keep what we've achieved.

21:46.720 --> 21:47.799
In that case,

21:48.200 --> 21:49.920
the influence of our military

21:49.920 --> 21:51.079
our military's influence.

21:51.559 --> 21:52.640
Exactly.

21:53.319 --> 21:56.440
We must try our best

21:56.440 --> 21:58.240
to make the peace talk end in failure.

21:58.240 --> 21:59.559
I leave the task

22:00.240 --> 22:01.839
Is entrusted to you.

22:03.519 --> 22:04.039
Yes

22:07.359 --> 22:09.000
today, I, Chen Jiaping,

22:09.079 --> 22:11.160
officially marries Zuo Shuangtao.

22:11.839 --> 22:15.200
I will always be loyal to you,

22:16.119 --> 22:18.400
love you, believe in you,

22:18.799 --> 22:20.720
to take care of you.

22:23.079 --> 22:23.960
Come here.

22:24.920 --> 22:25.799
And take care of you.

22:26.279 --> 22:29.920
And be with each other for the rest of our lives.

22:31.359 --> 22:32.000
Come.

22:32.319 --> 22:32.960
This way, please.

22:54.799 --> 22:55.480
Officer Kimura.

22:55.759 --> 22:57.079
Let me report something to you.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.480
What you ordered

23:03.480 --> 23:05.000
I've arranged it.

23:09.480 --> 23:10.519
We must keep this

23:11.000 --> 23:12.880
you must keep this a secret.

23:12.880 --> 23:13.839
Don't worry.

23:14.440 --> 23:16.079
Feng Qi is reliable

23:16.079 --> 23:17.200
and tight-lipped.

23:44.039 --> 23:45.720
Have mutual affinity

23:46.559 --> 23:47.200
section Chief Chen

23:48.839 --> 23:49.559
captain Zhao.

23:50.480 --> 23:51.400
What are you doing?

23:51.759 --> 23:52.880
I'm a little nervous.

23:53.119 --> 23:53.960
Are you memorizing lyrics?

24:03.279 --> 24:04.079
Thank you.

24:05.200 --> 24:06.039
It's a wedding

24:07.319 --> 24:08.720
chief Chen, seriously

24:09.599 --> 24:11.359
you look like a decent man

24:12.519 --> 24:13.920
In this suit.

24:15.160 --> 24:15.960
Right?

24:16.359 --> 24:17.240
Right.

24:17.519 --> 24:18.440
That's right.

24:18.960 --> 24:19.799
What Captain Zhao

24:20.160 --> 24:22.119
I always learn about

24:22.119 --> 24:24.319
has always been what I learn from.

24:32.119 --> 24:33.079
And good taste.

24:33.079 --> 24:34.200
Thank you, Captain Zhao.

24:35.319 --> 24:37.160
The banquet is about to begin.

24:37.160 --> 24:38.079
I'm not hungry.

24:50.920 --> 24:52.920
OK.

24:53.880 --> 24:55.880
Alright.

24:57.440 --> 24:58.240
It hasn't started yet.

24:58.240 --> 24:59.319
Why are you drinking?

25:02.000 --> 25:02.720
Fang Fang,

25:03.319 --> 25:03.720
I'll drink with you.

25:17.440 --> 25:18.279
She's beautiful

25:18.599 --> 25:20.119
section Chief Chen is so lucky

25:20.359 --> 25:21.920
any woman is beautiful

25:21.920 --> 25:23.359
every woman is not beautiful.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.680
That's not necessarily the case.

25:26.160 --> 25:27.480
Sometimes,

25:27.759 --> 25:30.200
It's more important to get married than to dress nicely

25:30.440 --> 25:31.720
than a beautiful bride.

25:43.480 --> 25:44.440
Did you see that?

25:45.039 --> 25:46.599
Have you seen Zuo Shuangtao?

25:47.000 --> 25:48.759
This is the woman you love.

25:49.680 --> 25:50.519
Right?

25:50.519 --> 25:51.960
Who are you referring to?

25:52.559 --> 25:54.400
I don't know her at all.

25:54.400 --> 25:56.000
Such an act?

25:56.000 --> 25:57.200
You know what?

25:57.559 --> 25:58.759
This woman is going to sleep

25:58.759 --> 26:01.279
Is going to sleep with another man tonight.

26:03.119 --> 26:03.680
I don't believe that.

26:03.680 --> 26:06.000
That you don't have any feelings at all?

26:16.480 --> 26:17.799
Go out and have a drink.

26:18.799 --> 26:20.039
I'll watch the movie with Kun.

26:37.240 --> 26:39.119
Next, let the groom

26:39.119 --> 26:40.079
and bride

26:40.079 --> 26:41.440
exchange rings

27:03.880 --> 27:04.880
from today on,

27:05.880 --> 27:07.240
I will be loyal...

27:08.000 --> 27:09.079
To love you forever,

27:10.960 --> 27:11.880
and to trust you

27:13.319 --> 27:14.279
to help you,

27:16.359 --> 27:17.160
and take good care of you.

27:21.680 --> 27:22.680
What about you?

27:24.160 --> 27:25.279
Is indeed imperfect.

27:27.079 --> 27:27.519
But of course,

27:27.519 --> 27:28.519
I'm not perfect either.

27:30.079 --> 27:32.000
But the two of us will

27:34.359 --> 27:35.680
that'll be perfect.

27:49.240 --> 27:52.359
Alright.

28:01.039 --> 28:01.680
Master.

28:01.960 --> 28:03.039
The boat is ready.

28:03.279 --> 28:04.079
We are ready.

28:04.079 --> 28:05.079
We can leave any time.

28:05.079 --> 28:05.720
Alright.

28:06.599 --> 28:08.400
When will the person you are talking about come?

28:11.240 --> 28:12.240
She will come.

28:14.440 --> 28:15.279
When!

28:17.200 --> 28:19.640
Are you feeling pain right now?

28:20.039 --> 28:22.200
And shamed?

28:22.200 --> 28:23.920
Take this away.

28:23.920 --> 28:25.799
Are you still going to protect this woman?

28:26.079 --> 28:28.000
I don't want to see it anymore.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.319
Please.

28:33.799 --> 28:35.200
A serrated knife.

28:37.400 --> 28:39.640
There's no serrated knife.

28:41.440 --> 28:44.480
Next, I'll have the bride and groom

28:44.480 --> 28:46.240
to cut the cake for you.

28:46.240 --> 28:47.279
He shared their sweetness

28:47.279 --> 28:49.160
to everyone here.

28:53.119 --> 28:54.440
On such an important occasion,

28:54.799 --> 28:57.039
we'd like to invite Mr. Murayama

28:57.319 --> 28:59.880
to cut the happy cake with us.

29:30.240 --> 29:31.039
When.

29:32.720 --> 29:33.960
I can understand you.

29:35.480 --> 29:37.000
Just tell me

29:37.400 --> 29:39.079
If Zuo Shuangtao is

29:39.079 --> 29:41.200
and assassinate Martial Master of the Mountain Below?

29:42.480 --> 29:43.319
I promise

29:44.599 --> 29:45.880
to spare your life.

29:48.079 --> 29:48.759
That's not right.

29:49.799 --> 29:51.279
Not only will I spare your life,

29:52.400 --> 29:54.440
I can't forgive

29:55.000 --> 29:56.519
for the past.

29:58.200 --> 29:58.960
Alright?

30:00.839 --> 30:01.799
Alright?

30:02.599 --> 30:03.720
Let bygones be bygones

30:04.240 --> 30:06.000
I want to see the warrior under the mountain.

30:08.079 --> 30:09.640
It's the same if you told me.

30:09.640 --> 30:11.359
I want to see the warrior under the mountain.

30:12.279 --> 30:14.079
I want to see him alone.

30:59.000 --> 30:59.920
This way, please.

31:18.920 --> 31:20.079
The Grand Commander of the Lower Hill.

31:20.079 --> 31:21.079
I'll be at the gate

31:21.680 --> 31:22.599
call me anytime.

31:34.839 --> 31:37.519
Now we're the only two left.

31:38.160 --> 31:39.319
What do you want to say?

31:40.519 --> 31:41.160
What is it?

31:43.079 --> 31:45.079
Untie me first.

31:53.240 --> 31:55.160
I'm already in this state.

31:56.160 --> 31:57.359
You have a gun,

31:57.720 --> 31:59.559
It is your men outside.

32:00.920 --> 32:02.839
You still worry that I'll kill you?

32:16.960 --> 32:17.640
All right.

32:18.680 --> 32:20.160
What do you want to tell me?

32:20.880 --> 32:21.400
What's it?

32:21.680 --> 32:22.720
I told you.

32:23.799 --> 32:25.240
What's in it for me?

32:25.799 --> 32:27.480
You can get some reward.

32:28.400 --> 32:31.599
And leave here safely.

32:32.119 --> 32:33.599
Certainly,

32:33.599 --> 32:35.640
If you're willing to give it up,

32:36.200 --> 32:37.519
you can be

32:37.519 --> 32:39.759
you can be the team leader.

32:40.000 --> 32:44.519
At the same time, you'll receive a large settlement fund.

32:50.480 --> 32:51.319
Dear guests,

32:51.640 --> 32:53.480
It's almost eight o'clock.

32:53.640 --> 32:55.359
The most exciting moment

32:55.359 --> 32:57.319
of the wedding.

32:57.680 --> 33:00.559
Please raise your head and look to the sky now.

33:00.559 --> 33:02.279
The firework show.

33:03.240 --> 33:04.519
Mr. Only.

33:04.960 --> 33:07.240
The Chief of Shanghai District, Wang Tianmu,

33:07.720 --> 33:09.759
zhao Gangyi from Qingdao Station

33:09.759 --> 33:12.240
and Pei San of Tianjin Railway Station.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.720
Their level is much higher than yours.

33:14.880 --> 33:17.279
That's why they're alive.

33:17.599 --> 33:19.759
We're the same, aren't we?

33:20.279 --> 33:21.720
What are you worried about?

33:39.359 --> 33:41.079
Why don't you leave Shanghai?

33:41.720 --> 33:42.759
When I close my eyes,

33:43.119 --> 33:45.000
I was seeing Xiao Hu and Da Xuan.

33:45.359 --> 33:46.359
How am I supposed to leave?

33:47.200 --> 33:48.400
I want to stay to take revenge.

33:48.920 --> 33:50.000
And kill them.

33:50.400 --> 33:51.359
To get the secret letter back.

33:52.640 --> 33:54.279
But I don't know what to do.

33:54.640 --> 33:56.160
Can you help me think of a way?

33:57.119 --> 33:58.279
I have one solution,

34:00.160 --> 34:01.000
however...

34:01.599 --> 34:02.519
What?

34:03.279 --> 34:04.920
Requires you to make a huge sacrifice.

34:04.920 --> 34:06.319
I'm not afraid to die.

34:07.160 --> 34:08.199
Tell me what to do.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.800
First, you need to be caught by Zhao An.

34:12.159 --> 34:14.079
And make sure they don't suspect

34:14.079 --> 34:15.880
of your arrest.

34:16.559 --> 34:18.039
What about after he was arrested?

34:20.719 --> 34:22.559
Did you see the number on it?

34:22.960 --> 34:24.320
Zhao An read my information.

34:24.679 --> 34:26.199
He will definitely find out

34:26.199 --> 34:28.400
has something to do with

34:28.679 --> 34:30.159
he will suspect

34:30.960 --> 34:32.840
why is my birthday engraved

34:32.840 --> 34:34.360
on the pendant you carry?

34:34.519 --> 34:35.840
The only explanation

34:36.159 --> 34:37.679
Is that you like me.

34:39.639 --> 34:41.480
Then we can get the hook.

34:42.559 --> 34:43.119
Alright.

34:43.599 --> 34:44.559
But you have to remember,

34:45.920 --> 34:48.519
don't do anything until eight o'clock.

35:17.039 --> 35:18.159
What's wrong, Guoguo?

35:26.400 --> 35:27.800
Give me a hug.

35:29.400 --> 35:30.480
Don't speak.

35:32.400 --> 35:33.159
Just for a while

36:18.719 --> 36:19.360
jiaping,

36:20.719 --> 36:22.039
I need to use the bathroom.

36:22.719 --> 36:23.880
Okay, I'll go with you.

36:24.079 --> 36:24.760
No need.

36:25.679 --> 36:27.199
You have to take care of everyone here.

36:33.239 --> 36:34.079
Alright.

36:34.480 --> 36:35.400
Go and be back quickly.

37:43.280 --> 37:44.320
Mr. Yamashita.

37:44.840 --> 37:45.760
Mr. Yamashita.

37:46.960 --> 37:47.840
Mr. Yamashita.

37:48.119 --> 37:49.079
What's wrong?

37:50.079 --> 37:51.000
Mr. Foot the mountain.

38:19.920 --> 38:21.960
Mr. Underfoot.

38:22.719 --> 38:23.599
Captain Zhao.

38:24.480 --> 38:25.199
Captain Zhao.

38:25.199 --> 38:27.079
Commander Yamashita.

38:28.199 --> 38:28.920
Under the mountain

38:30.920 --> 38:31.760
captain Zhao.

38:32.199 --> 38:33.760
What's wrong with Mr. Yamashita?

38:34.800 --> 38:35.800
He was assassinated.

38:37.400 --> 38:38.159
Commander!

38:39.199 --> 38:40.719
Then ask for help!

38:41.039 --> 38:42.199
I'll stop the bleeding.

38:45.679 --> 38:46.840
Hurry.

38:55.360 --> 38:56.159
Got stabbed.

39:05.840 --> 39:07.519
Hurry to send her to the hospital for rescue!

39:07.519 --> 39:08.599
First aid?

39:08.599 --> 39:09.320
Jerk!

39:09.960 --> 39:11.360
Go after Kun now!

39:11.360 --> 39:12.039
Yes

39:12.039 --> 39:12.840
come on.

39:13.199 --> 39:14.159
What's going on?

39:14.599 --> 39:15.239
I didn't know.

39:15.920 --> 39:18.320
I saw him like this the moment I came.

39:23.920 --> 39:24.920
Left Pair Tao.

39:25.199 --> 39:26.480
Why are you here?

39:27.239 --> 39:28.599
I went to the bathroom

39:29.119 --> 39:29.920
I heard gunshots

39:29.920 --> 39:31.159
and someone's shouting.

39:31.719 --> 39:33.159
I came running right away.

39:33.159 --> 39:34.559
Why did it go faster than us?

39:35.119 --> 39:37.119
The toilet is close to here

39:39.039 --> 39:40.920
aren't you afraid of gunshots?

39:40.920 --> 39:42.039
And you'll come back?

39:42.320 --> 39:43.280
Officer Kimura.

39:43.639 --> 39:44.920
This is my wedding.

39:45.599 --> 39:48.000
The most important moment in a woman's life.

39:48.800 --> 39:50.559
Someone fired shots in my wedding.

39:50.559 --> 39:52.239
Should I hide?

39:52.760 --> 39:54.559
Or rush at him and kill him?

39:55.519 --> 39:56.400
Officer Kimura.

39:57.400 --> 39:59.320
This may be a misunderstanding.

40:01.599 --> 40:02.480
Cordon off the scene

40:02.800 --> 40:03.800
no one is allowed to leave.

40:04.079 --> 40:04.760
Yes

40:09.800 --> 40:10.679
are you all right?

40:20.079 --> 40:22.239
Hide in the utility room on the first floor

40:22.519 --> 40:24.559
I hid my military uniform there.

40:43.320 --> 40:44.719
Nobody move!

40:45.599 --> 40:47.320
I will kill whoever moves.

40:49.360 --> 40:50.639
Just now Colonel Yamashita

40:50.639 --> 40:51.880
he lost

40:51.880 --> 40:53.719
a very important item.

40:54.960 --> 40:57.039
Every one of you is a suspect.

41:00.719 --> 41:01.280
Search!

41:09.239 --> 41:10.159
I really don't have one.

41:12.519 --> 41:13.440
No, I...

41:23.840 --> 41:24.920
Do you still want to take off your clothes?

41:24.920 --> 41:26.440
I took nothing.

41:33.840 --> 41:34.599
Don't look at them.

41:35.159 --> 41:36.119
I told you.

41:36.480 --> 41:38.199
I'll kill whoever moves.

41:42.880 --> 41:43.679
Left Shuangtao.

41:45.280 --> 41:48.840
You were the closest to Commander Shanxia.

42:05.320 --> 42:06.039
Who are you

42:06.679 --> 42:08.639
I'm on a mission with Zuo Shuangtao.

42:09.119 --> 42:10.000
My name is Kun.

42:10.480 --> 42:11.960
We're on a mission together.

42:12.639 --> 42:13.639
Where is Left Shuangtao?

42:14.280 --> 42:15.599
She asked me to come and find you

42:15.840 --> 42:17.519
you will arrange for me to evacuate.

42:19.559 --> 42:20.639
Have you completed your mission?

42:21.000 --> 42:22.519
I already killed Yamashita.

42:23.039 --> 42:23.920
Where is she?

42:24.280 --> 42:25.400
Although Yamashita died,

42:25.400 --> 42:26.960
I didn't get the secret letter yet.

42:28.039 --> 42:29.119
We know her well.

42:29.760 --> 42:30.920
She won't leave.

42:33.679 --> 42:35.280
This is outrageous.

42:36.280 --> 42:37.519
She still has no discipline in her eyes

42:37.519 --> 42:38.639
Is she organized?

42:39.440 --> 42:40.920
But I have to say that

42:41.480 --> 42:43.360
zuo Shuangtao is very predictable.

42:43.800 --> 42:45.880
Both Yamashita and Zhao An were tricked by her.

42:46.760 --> 42:49.159
I can arrange for you to hide in a safe place.

42:50.039 --> 42:52.599
We'll meet Zuo Shuangtao when she gets the secret message.

42:52.599 --> 42:54.199
And find a way to leave Shanghai.

42:58.239 --> 42:58.840
Hand...

43:00.079 --> 43:01.039
Stretch your hands.

43:14.199 --> 43:15.079
Officer Kimura.

43:15.360 --> 43:16.280
Nothing.

43:19.920 --> 43:20.719
Take off your clothes.

43:21.800 --> 43:22.320
This...

43:32.559 --> 43:33.440
Officer Kimura.

43:34.320 --> 43:35.239
The thing you mentioned

43:35.239 --> 43:37.159
Is definitely not with Zuo Shuangtao.

43:37.159 --> 43:38.440
As your family.

43:38.440 --> 43:39.840
Can you make an exception?

43:39.840 --> 43:41.320
Zuo Shuangtao and I

43:41.320 --> 43:42.800
got married today.

43:43.559 --> 43:44.079
As a husband,

43:44.079 --> 43:46.159
I also want to save my wife's face.

43:46.840 --> 43:48.760
I will serve the empire twice in the future.

43:49.599 --> 43:51.480
Home safety! Home safe!

43:52.760 --> 43:53.360
Take off your clothes!
