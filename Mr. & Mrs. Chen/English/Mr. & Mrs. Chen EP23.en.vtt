01:35.680 --> 01:37.120
Are you sure it was a magpie?

01:38.280 --> 01:39.200
As sure as a gun

01:39.799 --> 01:41.359
I've ordered you to stop the mission.

01:41.359 --> 01:42.719
Why are you still following him?

01:44.879 --> 01:46.079
I don't want to give up easily.

01:47.120 --> 01:48.760
Is it because you don't want to give up easily?

01:49.400 --> 01:50.599
Do you have no other motives?

02:01.280 --> 02:03.000
At least you knew that Magpie died.

02:04.239 --> 02:05.599
He didn't have the formula

02:06.519 --> 02:07.840
the man from Chongqing.

02:07.840 --> 02:09.000
(made a deal with Magpie to meet and exchange with him)

02:09.000 --> 02:10.560
At Da Hua Hotel to make a deal.

02:11.360 --> 02:13.240
But the Japanese followed and attacked him.

02:13.719 --> 02:14.800
Magpie ran away.

02:32.840 --> 02:35.080
I followed Zuo Shuangtao to find the clue.

02:35.080 --> 02:36.400
And found Magpie.

02:36.520 --> 02:38.599
But it died of an accident.

02:38.599 --> 02:41.080
And she came across Kimura Kenzo during the process.

02:41.479 --> 02:43.520
But he had no choice but to kill him.

02:43.680 --> 02:47.479
Besides, Zuo Shuangtao told me about his military identity.

02:47.479 --> 02:48.520
To learn from her that

02:49.039 --> 02:52.199
that Chongqing planned to sabotage the Border Region's economy

02:52.199 --> 02:54.919
to carry out a sinister plan to destroy the economy of the Border Region.

02:55.319 --> 02:57.080
That's what the magpie and the goose

02:57.080 --> 02:59.520
why the magpies and the geese lurk in Yan'an.

03:07.240 --> 03:08.680
And succeed.

03:09.680 --> 03:10.759
Papers for sale.

03:12.240 --> 03:13.319
Sell my papers?

03:14.560 --> 03:15.639
Selling news.

03:17.560 --> 03:19.159
Smoke and fire.

03:20.879 --> 03:21.960
Why are you so late?

03:22.199 --> 03:23.639
There was a traffic jam.

03:26.360 --> 03:28.319
Where's the bicycle yesterday?

03:29.960 --> 03:30.759
Could it break

03:30.759 --> 03:31.599
after you sit there.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.080
What do you mean?

03:35.280 --> 03:36.520
I didn't say you are fat.

03:37.240 --> 03:39.919
My bike is old.

03:44.159 --> 03:44.599
Scallion pancake.

03:44.599 --> 03:45.400
I bought it for you.

03:45.560 --> 03:46.120
No, I won't.

03:49.280 --> 03:50.479
To talk to your people?

03:51.759 --> 03:52.280
What's up

03:52.759 --> 03:53.639
what's the new?

03:53.960 --> 03:55.840
How can you speak like my superior?

03:56.039 --> 03:57.439
Of course I'm anxious.

03:57.439 --> 03:58.439
I'm with you,

03:58.439 --> 04:00.400
I'm really annoyed and anxious.

04:03.879 --> 04:05.240
One thing is very strange.

04:05.240 --> 04:06.840
Help me analyze it.

04:06.840 --> 04:07.080
Alright.

04:07.360 --> 04:07.879
What is it?

04:08.280 --> 04:11.719
Before Magpie agreed to go to the hospital yesterday,

04:13.199 --> 04:15.120
to make a deal with our people.

04:15.439 --> 04:17.040
But they got exposed.

04:17.040 --> 04:18.319
The deal fell through.

04:18.319 --> 04:18.800
The formula

04:18.800 --> 04:20.720
the formula should be on the magpie.

04:22.079 --> 04:23.240
But I didn't find it

04:24.079 --> 04:25.240
then who took it?

04:26.240 --> 04:28.439
If he didn't have the formula,

04:28.839 --> 04:30.399
without the formula

04:31.079 --> 04:32.759
I don't think he's so bold.

04:34.720 --> 04:36.720
But Kimura is also looking for magpies.

04:36.959 --> 04:38.519
That means they haven't got the formula either.

04:38.920 --> 04:39.560
That's right

04:39.720 --> 04:41.279
that means

04:41.480 --> 04:43.360
after he left the trading place,

04:43.759 --> 04:45.439
and on the way to the hospital

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
the formula was missing

04:47.639 --> 04:49.040
I guess that

04:49.040 --> 04:51.800
that he hid the formula in his wound

04:52.079 --> 04:53.800
when I saw the corpse,

04:54.160 --> 04:55.680
there are new stitches in the wound.

05:00.079 --> 05:01.360
Have you analyzed it?

05:02.240 --> 05:03.399
Please give me some time

05:03.399 --> 05:04.560
to think it over.

05:04.560 --> 05:05.680
You scared me.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.879
Why are you so interested in the formula?

05:09.879 --> 05:10.720
Because the formula

05:10.720 --> 05:12.439
no matter it falls into our hands

05:13.120 --> 05:14.399
or the Japanese,

05:15.000 --> 05:16.959
It will be devastating to

05:17.319 --> 05:18.639
to the economy of the Chinese Communist Border Region.

05:20.160 --> 05:21.920
Guoguo is disappointed with Juntong

05:21.920 --> 05:24.240
with each passing day.

05:25.079 --> 05:27.399
And is willing to align with our ally.

05:27.839 --> 05:30.040
We can cooperate with her in the future.

05:30.040 --> 05:32.120
We can develop and cultivate her.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.480
You look so strange at me.

05:37.959 --> 05:38.639
Strange?

05:39.560 --> 05:41.519
You can't see if you love me or fear me

05:41.519 --> 05:43.279
love me or fear me?

05:43.759 --> 05:44.199
Love?

05:45.839 --> 05:47.600
You're saying that out of fear.

05:51.800 --> 05:52.519
See?

05:53.399 --> 05:54.319
Admit it.

05:55.199 --> 05:56.800
Fear tells lies.

05:57.040 --> 05:58.040
You don't love her.

05:58.199 --> 06:00.879
If I say love but I'm afraid, will you believe me?

06:01.360 --> 06:02.079
You don't believe me.

06:02.199 --> 06:03.560
Then how am I supposed to answer?

06:04.319 --> 06:05.839
Women can only ask questions.

06:06.839 --> 06:08.399
It's your man's business.

06:08.759 --> 06:10.279
Then you're being unreasonable.

06:11.480 --> 06:12.519
So please answer.

06:13.720 --> 06:14.639
Love me or fear me?

06:15.480 --> 06:17.439
I'm afraid that you don't love me.

06:20.040 --> 06:20.600
Just eat.

06:20.600 --> 06:21.759
The car won't break down.

06:22.079 --> 06:23.079
No food.

06:23.319 --> 06:24.319
Drive your car.

06:26.519 --> 06:27.800
It won't break down.

06:38.439 --> 06:39.519
News for sale!

06:42.920 --> 06:44.160
Why are you so late?

06:44.560 --> 06:45.600
Something bad happened.

06:45.600 --> 06:46.360
What happened?

06:47.199 --> 06:47.920
Last night

06:47.920 --> 06:49.600
officer Kimura died on duty.

06:50.240 --> 06:50.920
What did you say

06:51.480 --> 06:53.040
the mourning ceremony will be held soon.

06:53.040 --> 06:54.399
The new chief will also come.

06:54.680 --> 06:55.720
Hurry up.

07:02.519 --> 07:03.279
He died while doing the duty.

07:28.720 --> 07:29.759
What a surprise!

07:30.000 --> 07:31.959
It's said that the murderer who killed Kimura's chief

07:32.279 --> 07:33.560
was his informant.

07:34.959 --> 07:36.079
??? Against the wind for years ???

07:37.079 --> 07:39.079
Once the boat capsized in the gutter,

07:41.240 --> 07:42.079
by the way, Manager Luo,

07:42.279 --> 07:43.120
the batch of goods

07:43.160 --> 07:44.480
was dispatched from Wuxi.

07:44.879 --> 07:46.399
It will arrive in Shanghai in two days.

07:47.079 --> 07:48.879
Put the goods in the warehouse

07:49.480 --> 07:50.360
don't move for now.

07:50.839 --> 07:51.319
Why not?

07:51.319 --> 07:53.120
It's the right time to sell it at a higher price.

07:53.360 --> 07:54.759
Kimura is dead now.

07:55.680 --> 07:57.160
Don't you know

07:57.160 --> 07:59.639
the Military Police will make trouble next.

07:59.639 --> 08:01.879
We must be cautious at this time.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Otherwise,

08:08.040 --> 08:09.279
when did you come?

08:11.879 --> 08:12.600
I just arrived.

08:14.399 --> 08:15.439
You were so spooky.

08:16.959 --> 08:18.560
I was so scared.

08:18.959 --> 08:20.759
You are so bold that you dare not breathe.

08:21.680 --> 08:22.480
Stand properly.

08:22.879 --> 08:24.519
The next chief will arrive soon.

08:28.519 --> 08:30.240
Who's the new chief?

08:30.839 --> 08:32.200
Lieutenant Naoki Ueda.

08:32.639 --> 08:33.519
Uchida.

08:35.840 --> 08:38.799
It's the day Miss Han Lu was caught by Zhao An.

08:39.279 --> 08:40.600
It's Ueda that

08:41.159 --> 08:42.679
who took Cold Dew away, right?

08:45.200 --> 08:46.200
I don't know much

08:46.200 --> 08:47.200
his background.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.399
He should be with the warrior under the mountain.

08:49.399 --> 08:49.840
That's right.

08:50.039 --> 08:51.879
He is Chief of Secret Service,

08:51.879 --> 08:53.519
and Huang Mu Wei's hardcore bro.

09:15.360 --> 09:16.200
What's up

09:17.919 --> 09:18.679
It's fine.

09:19.559 --> 09:20.840
Take it easy.

09:23.000 --> 09:23.879
Captain Zhao.

09:24.639 --> 09:25.879
If Officer Kimura is dead,

09:26.399 --> 09:28.120
Is our backer gone too?

09:28.240 --> 09:31.000
Mumu Village is a small hill.

09:31.799 --> 09:35.440
Plan Shan is our biggest backer.

09:36.080 --> 09:36.639
Understood.

09:38.440 --> 09:40.000
And Huang Jinming was killed.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.480
And Kimura wouldn't have left us alone,

09:42.039 --> 09:43.559
he won't spare us.

09:45.480 --> 09:46.799
He managed to escape this time.

09:48.720 --> 09:49.840
He died well.

10:21.960 --> 10:22.399
Officer.

10:22.679 --> 10:23.679
My name is Qian Chengyi.

10:23.720 --> 10:24.440
The rich money

10:24.440 --> 10:25.080
to succeed.

10:25.080 --> 10:26.039
The successful

10:27.320 --> 10:28.279
xiucai Qian.

10:28.960 --> 10:29.759
Scram!

10:40.679 --> 10:43.039
I have no interest in killing people.

10:44.080 --> 10:45.200
Is so cheap.

10:45.200 --> 10:46.440
It is too cheap.

11:21.720 --> 11:22.279
Go in.

11:22.559 --> 11:22.919
Yes

11:30.639 --> 11:31.320
come in.

11:44.519 --> 11:45.159
Good day, sir.

11:45.960 --> 11:47.799
Officer Uchida wants me to report

11:49.000 --> 11:50.279
how your opium plan

11:50.440 --> 11:51.399
with your opium plan?

11:52.600 --> 11:54.360
I've recently opened two more transport lines

11:54.360 --> 11:56.519
to the Kuomintang-controlled area in northern Zhejiang.

11:56.879 --> 11:59.080
The carrying capacity has doubled.

11:59.360 --> 11:59.960
Great.

12:00.960 --> 12:03.879
Please report to me directly

12:04.279 --> 12:05.679
directly report to me.

12:06.240 --> 12:06.960
Yes

12:22.399 --> 12:24.039
I thought you'd left Shanghai.

12:28.159 --> 12:29.960
How would the Japanese know my whereabouts?

12:31.200 --> 12:32.600
I was followed by the Japanese.

12:32.799 --> 12:34.799
My plan is ruined, you know?

12:38.080 --> 12:39.320
So you suspect that

12:40.159 --> 12:41.320
I betrayed you?

12:43.759 --> 12:45.279
You asked to see me for one last time.

12:45.720 --> 12:46.639
For the last time?

12:47.720 --> 12:48.159
Shoot.

12:50.600 --> 12:51.519
Just shoot.

12:52.279 --> 12:55.159
You must've colluded with Yamashita

12:55.639 --> 12:57.639
to lure me out, right?

12:58.480 --> 12:58.759
Right

12:59.919 --> 13:00.399
so, shoot!

13:00.399 --> 13:01.279
What are you doing?

13:01.279 --> 13:01.919
Shoot!

13:04.600 --> 13:05.600
Are you out of your mind?

13:06.559 --> 13:07.360
Gunshot!

13:07.360 --> 13:08.720
Go check it!

13:08.879 --> 13:10.080
Do you believe me now?

13:10.320 --> 13:11.600
You alerted the military police.

13:15.720 --> 13:16.679
Follow me.

13:23.279 --> 13:25.200
Someone from the mountain must have followed you.

13:25.879 --> 13:27.519
Why did he follow me?

13:27.799 --> 13:29.960
It's not as simple as you think.

13:30.399 --> 13:31.759
His investment in making films

13:31.759 --> 13:33.039
Is just a cover.

13:33.440 --> 13:35.480
The Shan Plan I came to investigate

13:35.879 --> 13:37.039
must be related to him.

13:40.240 --> 13:41.480
I just want to make movies.

13:41.919 --> 13:43.399
I don't want to be involved in the Shan Project.

13:45.720 --> 13:46.320
No way.

13:47.759 --> 13:49.279
I need to escape from that demon as soon as possible.

13:49.279 --> 13:50.440
You can't run away from him,

13:51.000 --> 13:52.720
Instead, you have to go back to him.

13:53.879 --> 13:54.480
Why?

13:54.600 --> 13:55.799
Because he's using you.

13:56.480 --> 13:58.120
But you could also use him.

14:00.799 --> 14:02.759
You want me to be

14:04.240 --> 14:05.440
and be your informant.

14:09.240 --> 14:10.399
Do you know what

14:11.440 --> 14:12.759
what Yamashita did to me?

14:14.320 --> 14:16.639
As long as I can succeed in this mission,

14:17.279 --> 14:18.519
all the credits

14:19.360 --> 14:20.519
for all the credit.

14:25.159 --> 14:25.960
Credit?

14:29.679 --> 14:30.320
Who's that?

14:34.080 --> 14:35.200
Come with me.

14:39.320 --> 14:40.200
Mr. Guo,

14:41.240 --> 14:42.679
I brought some clean clothes

14:42.679 --> 14:43.759
and food for you.

14:45.240 --> 14:46.080
Who is he?

14:47.120 --> 14:48.120
He's Guo Yun.

14:48.679 --> 14:50.519
One night last week,

14:50.519 --> 14:51.559
I just got off work

14:52.120 --> 14:53.559
I was about to leave the set,

14:54.200 --> 14:56.120
I heard some noise in the props warehouse.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.240
I thought the prop master was not off duty

14:59.600 --> 15:00.679
so I went to say hello.

15:00.960 --> 15:01.919
To my surprise,

15:02.159 --> 15:04.399
several Japanese gendarmes rushed in

15:04.600 --> 15:05.600
and searched everywhere

15:06.440 --> 15:07.879
so I hid him here.

15:11.039 --> 15:12.879
He has a special smell on him.

15:18.399 --> 15:19.919
Of plate cleaning solution.

15:20.279 --> 15:21.600
Did he tell you anything?

15:21.600 --> 15:23.080
He can't remember anything?

15:23.600 --> 15:24.720
He just said that

15:25.279 --> 15:26.000
sunshine.

15:26.440 --> 15:27.720
I want to see the sun.

15:28.240 --> 15:29.919
I don't want to work for the Japanese anymore.

15:30.360 --> 15:32.240
I don't want to work for the Japanese!

15:34.480 --> 15:36.000
So you must be involved

15:36.440 --> 15:38.799
the Japanese's counterfeit money printing?

15:50.759 --> 15:51.639
Chief Chen

15:55.639 --> 15:56.240
guoguo.

15:56.879 --> 15:57.799
I'm back

16:00.480 --> 16:01.399
look at this.

16:02.360 --> 16:04.320
I queued for 20 minutes

16:04.320 --> 16:06.200
I waited in line for 20 minutes.

16:08.279 --> 16:09.279
Thank you, honey.

16:10.360 --> 16:11.480
Such a sweet talker.

16:13.480 --> 16:13.960
Come on.

16:13.960 --> 16:14.600
Try it.

16:18.240 --> 16:19.120
It's really good.

16:30.600 --> 16:32.600
Since you've been so well recently,

16:33.480 --> 16:34.919
can you do me another favor?

16:36.000 --> 16:36.559
Alright.

16:36.559 --> 16:37.200
What else do you want to eat?

16:37.200 --> 16:38.039
I'll go and buy some for you.

16:41.600 --> 16:42.519
I want

16:45.240 --> 16:47.399
the sewer map of Shanghai.

16:55.919 --> 16:56.600
You choked.

16:56.600 --> 16:57.039
Come on.

16:57.039 --> 16:58.080
Have some soda.

17:03.720 --> 17:04.519
What?

17:05.559 --> 17:06.960
That I'll drug it again?

17:10.640 --> 17:12.400
Look at what you are doing.

17:16.000 --> 17:16.599
Don't

17:16.920 --> 17:18.480
don't try to drag me into this.

17:24.039 --> 17:24.559
Move over.

17:31.759 --> 17:33.400
We are a couple.

17:34.200 --> 17:35.480
Will you help me or not?

17:35.599 --> 17:36.599
I will take action.

17:38.119 --> 17:39.039
Also,

17:39.880 --> 17:41.400
once my identity is revealed,

17:43.240 --> 17:44.480
you can't help me

17:45.559 --> 17:46.480
you will be screwed as well.

17:46.960 --> 17:49.160
So you're helping yourself by helping me?

17:55.559 --> 17:57.400
Are you extorting me?

17:58.519 --> 18:00.559
That's how you blackmail me.

18:06.519 --> 18:07.519
However, Guoguo...

18:08.640 --> 18:10.480
The thing you want,

18:11.000 --> 18:12.559
to get the thing you want?

18:15.799 --> 18:17.200
It's said that it's a war secret.

18:17.440 --> 18:18.839
They've all transferred it from the Ministry of Industry

18:18.839 --> 18:21.039
to the archives of the Military Police Headquarters for safekeeping.

18:21.839 --> 18:22.279
The Constitution

18:23.440 --> 18:24.720
military Police Command?

18:25.200 --> 18:26.839
You think it's so simple

18:27.000 --> 18:29.079
as simple as lining up for ribbon fish?

18:34.640 --> 18:35.359
You're not my husband

18:35.359 --> 18:37.680
my husband who manages to think quickly.

18:39.400 --> 18:40.240
Next time,

18:40.759 --> 18:43.200
just add something to the soda water

18:43.480 --> 18:45.039
and make me faint.

18:47.039 --> 18:47.559
Let's eat.

18:49.960 --> 18:52.279
The military has clues about the counterfeit factory.

18:52.480 --> 18:54.279
There may be an important operation in the near future.

18:54.440 --> 18:55.440
The time is tight.

18:55.559 --> 18:58.200
To get approval for using Juntong

18:58.240 --> 19:00.359
to get more information.

19:00.519 --> 19:02.440
To wipe out the counterfeit factory,

19:02.839 --> 19:04.480
the formula and copper plates that we lost

19:04.920 --> 19:06.279
can be found.

19:07.319 --> 19:09.759
He can take part in the operation to destroy the Japanese counterfeit factory.

19:09.799 --> 19:11.279
But keep a close eye on the Military Commission

19:11.319 --> 19:13.440
Is there any other purpose in asking for the map?

19:13.680 --> 19:14.880
You must be cautious.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.359
Don't expose your identity.

19:19.400 --> 19:20.039
Lu Fangfang, there's no way

19:20.400 --> 19:21.119
she's here.

19:22.480 --> 19:23.079
What to drink?

19:23.400 --> 19:24.160
Latte please.

19:24.440 --> 19:25.319
Hello

19:25.319 --> 19:26.240
a latte, please.

19:26.359 --> 19:27.079
All right, sir.

19:27.559 --> 19:28.079
Have a seat.

19:28.720 --> 19:29.240
What about

19:29.680 --> 19:31.039
do you have what I asked you to bring?

19:31.480 --> 19:32.160
Yes, I have.

19:32.359 --> 19:33.240
You told me

19:33.240 --> 19:34.680
you made me look like a spy.

19:34.839 --> 19:35.880
Great.

19:37.319 --> 19:37.960
This one?

19:38.720 --> 19:39.960
Yes, that's it!

19:40.720 --> 19:41.880
It's against the rules

19:41.880 --> 19:42.920
to wear it.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.559
You must return it before getting off work.

19:44.599 --> 19:45.599
Got it.

19:45.599 --> 19:47.160
Then I'll return it to you.

19:48.720 --> 19:49.920
Why are you looking at this?

19:50.160 --> 19:50.759
I...

19:51.640 --> 19:53.240
My friend from Changzhou

19:53.240 --> 19:55.920
to bid for a sewer project.

19:56.079 --> 19:56.960
He wants to know about

19:56.960 --> 19:58.000
what type of pipes

19:58.039 --> 20:00.119
the sewer pipes in Shanghai use?

20:00.799 --> 20:02.200
It is unexpected that all these things

20:02.200 --> 20:03.519
have become military secrets.

20:05.519 --> 20:07.000
That's how Japanese are.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.920
They even charge the price

20:08.920 --> 20:10.640
you made it look like a military secret.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.000
I need to use the bathroom.

20:15.200 --> 20:15.720
Alright.

21:38.240 --> 21:39.039
All cleaned up.

21:44.279 --> 21:45.720
In cooking.

21:47.400 --> 21:48.480
I learned this before.

21:49.720 --> 21:50.720
You tricked me again.

21:51.599 --> 21:53.039
How could I learn?

21:54.319 --> 21:54.960
This

21:55.559 --> 21:57.599
a quick response out of desperation.

21:57.880 --> 22:00.480
All are forced by your evil spirit.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.599
Just like the little baby who can't swim

22:02.599 --> 22:03.519
Into the water.

22:03.720 --> 22:04.880
The water.

22:05.160 --> 22:05.960
And the same thing.

22:07.160 --> 22:07.839
Really?

22:09.960 --> 22:11.200
What a surprise!

22:11.880 --> 22:13.559
That he's still alive.

22:15.160 --> 22:16.519
I have to kill him again.

22:17.559 --> 22:18.720
Your military commander

22:18.880 --> 22:20.640
you always engage in assassination.

22:20.839 --> 22:23.319
Might serve as a deterrent to others.

22:23.640 --> 22:25.759
But the cause of national salvation

22:26.319 --> 22:26.559
then

22:27.160 --> 22:28.640
these methods alone, right?

22:32.119 --> 22:33.759
What do you think we should do then?

22:36.599 --> 22:38.000
You'll understand one day.

22:39.880 --> 22:41.279
What you just said

22:41.599 --> 22:43.640
I read about it in Xinhua Daily.

22:45.200 --> 22:46.480
Makes sense.

22:51.400 --> 22:53.440
Why Shangshan Hu is still alive

22:53.920 --> 22:56.440
he seems to have disappeared recently.

22:57.119 --> 22:58.480
What on earth he's doing,

22:58.880 --> 23:01.000
what is he discussing with Ueda?

23:05.920 --> 23:07.119
Do you want to know

23:08.079 --> 23:10.359
what do you use it for

23:11.000 --> 23:12.039
the sewer map?

23:14.319 --> 23:15.839
You become smarter this time.

23:17.799 --> 23:18.559
I'll tell you then.

23:18.559 --> 23:19.519
I won't listen to your advice.

23:19.519 --> 23:20.160
Please don't.

23:20.480 --> 23:21.160
Listen to this.

23:22.720 --> 23:24.079
I have a mission tonight.

23:24.799 --> 23:25.680
You

23:25.680 --> 23:27.160
stay at home.

23:27.720 --> 23:28.880
Don't run around.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.240
Ancestors,

23:30.240 --> 23:32.519
where do you get into trouble again?

23:32.920 --> 23:34.160
Don't worry.

23:36.279 --> 23:38.279
I just need to meet my superior.

23:38.680 --> 23:40.240
Please warm up the quilt at home,

23:40.400 --> 23:41.119
wait me back

23:41.119 --> 23:41.839
I won't...

23:45.480 --> 23:46.200
Alright then.

23:49.559 --> 23:50.960
Take care of yourself.

23:54.720 --> 23:55.359
Director Jiang,

23:55.359 --> 23:56.440
this is Left Shuangtao.

24:01.160 --> 24:03.839
Last time I was in danger in Yalpei Road villa,

24:04.200 --> 24:06.039
you dressed up as a nun and saved me.

24:06.720 --> 24:07.599
It's me.

24:07.960 --> 24:08.720
Left Twin Peaches.

24:08.920 --> 24:10.240
That lurk in Taihe's trading house

24:10.240 --> 24:11.720
which provided us with a lot of information.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.480
Did you get the water pipe distribution map?

24:14.680 --> 24:15.440
We got it.

24:22.319 --> 24:23.359
Director Jiang found

24:23.359 --> 24:26.039
a printer who worked in a Japanese printing factory.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.160
This man's name is Guo Yun,

24:27.480 --> 24:28.880
he was kidnapped by the Japanese.

24:29.519 --> 24:31.240
He had dysentery a while ago,

24:31.240 --> 24:32.839
the Japanese wanted to kill him,

24:32.839 --> 24:34.000
so they wanted to kill him.

24:34.680 --> 24:35.799
According to Guo Yun's memory,

24:36.279 --> 24:38.839
the counterfeit factory was built underground,

24:39.319 --> 24:41.480
as he didn't walk out of the ground,

24:41.480 --> 24:44.440
he walked from the factory to the sewer.

24:44.920 --> 24:46.359
The Japanese are so cunning.

24:46.599 --> 24:47.519
Like a mouse,

24:47.519 --> 24:48.759
they are hiding in the city ground,

24:48.759 --> 24:50.400
but no one knows where they are.

24:50.960 --> 24:52.000
That Guo Yun

24:52.480 --> 24:54.240
do you know which part of the city

24:54.240 --> 24:55.640
where in the city you walked through the sewer?

24:56.240 --> 24:58.039
And the sewers are almost the same.

24:58.039 --> 24:59.799
But the only thing he remembers is that

24:59.799 --> 25:01.880
he's gone for about 15 minutes.

25:01.880 --> 25:02.599
Then he saw

25:02.599 --> 25:04.160
there's a sewer number

25:04.160 --> 25:05.720
It's 43361.

25:05.720 --> 25:07.119
Is unique.

25:07.400 --> 25:08.759
So we can use this to determine

25:09.079 --> 25:10.359
where in the city

25:10.359 --> 25:11.640
was located in the city?

25:11.880 --> 25:13.039
It happened to be a rainstorm on that day.

25:13.039 --> 25:14.359
The water pipe was broken.

25:14.640 --> 25:16.920
The Japanese soldiers

25:16.920 --> 25:18.079
were swept away by the flood.

25:18.319 --> 25:19.119
Found it.

25:19.359 --> 25:20.880
433661.

25:20.880 --> 25:22.839
Huxi Chaoyang Road.

25:23.119 --> 25:24.119
Guo Yun said he walked for 15 minutes.

25:24.119 --> 25:26.000
Guo Yun said he left for 15 minutes.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.160
He started off from the underground factory.

25:29.319 --> 25:30.119
He's within 15 minutes' distance.

25:30.119 --> 25:32.079
If someone is within 15 minutes' distance,

25:33.079 --> 25:35.039
It must be the counterfeit factory

25:35.559 --> 25:36.559
but even if it's that,

25:36.880 --> 25:38.240
the scope is still too wide.

25:38.680 --> 25:40.240
All we have is a clue.

25:43.079 --> 25:43.839
Who is there?

25:44.079 --> 25:44.799
Don't.

25:44.880 --> 25:45.519
Don't shoot.

25:45.759 --> 25:47.880
I'm Zuo Shuangtao's husband.

25:49.839 --> 25:51.000
Why are you here?

25:51.000 --> 25:51.920
Go back.

25:51.920 --> 25:52.599
You're here.

25:52.599 --> 25:53.759
Where can I go back?

25:53.759 --> 25:55.119
You won't be back?

25:55.400 --> 25:56.359
Director Jiang,

25:56.359 --> 25:57.279
I can explain.

25:57.759 --> 25:58.519
I promise that

25:58.799 --> 26:00.000
he knows nothing.

26:00.200 --> 26:01.319
He's too worried about me.

26:01.319 --> 26:02.640
That's why he followed me.

26:03.319 --> 26:03.920
Jiaping.

26:03.920 --> 26:04.599
Come on.

26:05.640 --> 26:06.440
Explain it.

26:08.799 --> 26:09.680
Brothers,

26:10.359 --> 26:12.119
I'm Zuo Shuangtao's husband.

26:12.400 --> 26:13.480
I only look at my wife.

26:13.480 --> 26:14.519
Go out in the middle of the night.

26:14.519 --> 26:15.839
I was a little worried.

26:16.039 --> 26:16.799
But then I thought about it,

26:16.799 --> 26:18.200
I was an adult.

26:18.599 --> 26:19.599
I was alone in my room.

26:19.599 --> 26:22.279
My head was shining green.

26:23.200 --> 26:24.839
So I followed my wife here.

26:24.839 --> 26:26.279
I didn't mean to do it.

26:26.799 --> 26:28.079
You heard

26:28.279 --> 26:29.559
what we said just now?

26:30.119 --> 26:31.160
Just a little bit.

26:31.440 --> 26:32.599
We know

26:33.319 --> 26:34.160
you already knew?

26:34.599 --> 26:35.720
You are the military...

26:36.839 --> 26:37.680
You must be human.

26:38.160 --> 26:39.039
Sorry.

26:39.039 --> 26:40.279
I guessed wrong.

26:40.279 --> 26:40.799
Sorry!

26:40.799 --> 26:41.799
You're right.

26:41.799 --> 26:42.920
Director Jiang, here's the thing.

26:43.200 --> 26:43.880
Listen to me.

26:43.880 --> 26:45.039
Although he is a traitor,

26:45.039 --> 26:46.519
he must be an idle fellow.

26:46.880 --> 26:48.440
He is very timid.

26:48.960 --> 26:49.920
I promise that

26:50.440 --> 26:51.920
he won't tell us anything.

26:52.519 --> 26:53.279
If not,

26:53.799 --> 26:55.160
you don't have to kill him

26:55.839 --> 26:56.920
I'll kill him myself.

26:57.079 --> 26:58.799
My wife would definitely do that.

26:58.799 --> 26:59.640
You shut up.

27:02.200 --> 27:03.160
Director Jiang,

27:03.160 --> 27:04.000
here's the thing.

27:05.119 --> 27:07.000
He got a lot of information for me.

27:07.640 --> 27:09.000
He was not on our side,

27:09.160 --> 27:10.039
but

27:10.039 --> 27:11.880
he made an indirect contribution.

27:12.240 --> 27:13.759
He was the one

27:14.160 --> 27:15.319
who helped me get these sewer maps.

27:15.759 --> 27:16.119
How about this?

27:16.119 --> 27:17.720
Please allow me to say something.

27:20.279 --> 27:20.960
What is it?

27:23.400 --> 27:24.160
Actually,

27:24.160 --> 27:26.720
I did hear you outside.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.640
But after analysis,

27:28.640 --> 27:30.559
still haven't found out why.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.279
Is it convenient

27:32.279 --> 27:33.160
have a look.

27:33.519 --> 27:35.000
Let me see Guo Yun.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.799
Maybe I can help you find some clues.

27:36.799 --> 27:38.920
If I help you find out any clues,

27:39.960 --> 27:41.400
please let me go home.

27:41.839 --> 27:42.839
Please forgive me.

27:43.279 --> 27:44.319
I'll go home.

27:45.079 --> 27:46.799
I have to warm the bed

27:46.799 --> 27:48.440
and wash my wife's feet.

27:48.880 --> 27:50.000
It seems that

27:50.400 --> 27:52.000
you are such a good man.

27:52.160 --> 27:53.200
Brother, look.

27:53.200 --> 27:54.039
If you can keep me,

27:54.039 --> 27:55.039
might be of some use.

27:55.039 --> 27:56.000
If you kill me,

27:56.000 --> 27:57.480
my wife would be a widow.

27:58.039 --> 27:59.319
What a shame!

28:02.799 --> 28:04.599
Although Chen Jiaping is a traitor,

28:04.599 --> 28:06.759
he's innocent

28:06.759 --> 28:07.240
yes

28:07.839 --> 28:09.400
how about giving them a chance?

28:12.599 --> 28:13.359
Thanks.

28:24.279 --> 28:26.079
I'll give you ten minutes.

28:26.359 --> 28:27.680
If you don't find it

28:28.039 --> 28:29.279
If you don't find the exact location

28:29.279 --> 28:31.400
the exact location of the underground factory,

28:37.519 --> 28:38.319
don't worry.

28:41.480 --> 28:42.640
Have a seat.

28:46.599 --> 28:48.160
Just 10 minutes.

28:48.839 --> 28:50.240
I'll adjust the watch

28:50.240 --> 28:51.279
to 11 o'clock sharp.

28:54.200 --> 28:54.960
Here we go.

28:54.960 --> 28:55.680
Action!

28:59.960 --> 29:00.480
Brother.

29:01.400 --> 29:02.200
Take it easy.

29:03.079 --> 29:04.519
Can you help me think about

29:04.680 --> 29:06.559
of the day when I was kidnapped?

29:07.319 --> 29:08.160
Thank you.

29:08.799 --> 29:12.240
I used to be a technician in Changxing Printing Factory.

29:12.680 --> 29:14.160
Six months ago,

29:14.559 --> 29:16.319
on my way back from work

29:17.000 --> 29:18.480
I was kidnapped by several people

29:19.119 --> 29:21.359
they covered my face with a black cloth behind,

29:21.880 --> 29:23.119
and put me in the car

29:23.119 --> 29:24.640
how long has it been?

29:25.240 --> 29:26.240
It's a long time

29:26.680 --> 29:28.759
It's about two hours.

29:29.359 --> 29:31.720
Maybe they made a detour on purpose.

29:32.599 --> 29:33.559
The car stopped.

29:34.079 --> 29:35.400
I was taken to a place

29:35.839 --> 29:37.680
It seemed to be a factory.

29:39.079 --> 29:42.480
I heard loud machinery.

29:42.720 --> 29:43.720
After that,

29:44.359 --> 29:45.759
I went to the counterfeit factory.

29:46.359 --> 29:47.319
That's when they

29:47.920 --> 29:50.359
they took off the black cloth for me.

29:50.720 --> 29:51.720
Then try to recall

29:51.720 --> 29:53.160
In the counterfeit factory?

29:54.880 --> 29:55.279
The most,

29:55.839 --> 29:56.960
at the most,

29:58.000 --> 29:58.960
more than 40.

29:59.799 --> 30:00.519
However,

30:00.960 --> 30:02.559
new people will come from time to time

30:03.720 --> 30:04.759
and people will leave as well.

30:06.960 --> 30:07.960
They said they were leaving.

30:09.960 --> 30:10.920
Or she was killed.

30:12.519 --> 30:13.799
Those with poor skills

30:14.519 --> 30:15.759
and have serious illnesses.

30:16.799 --> 30:18.160
And those who don't obey orders,

30:20.359 --> 30:21.279
they all died.

30:22.720 --> 30:23.920
Do you know someone who works?

30:25.000 --> 30:25.839
No.

30:27.400 --> 30:29.759
I work with some other printers.

30:30.799 --> 30:32.160
We couldn't talk to each other,

30:32.440 --> 30:34.200
or ask each other's name.

30:35.400 --> 30:38.240
We call each other by numbers.

30:39.160 --> 30:40.119
I'm No. 75.

30:41.279 --> 30:41.960
Then,

30:42.519 --> 30:44.519
did you see the other staff?

30:45.519 --> 30:47.079
We have a plate-maker,

30:47.079 --> 30:48.200
or a copper engraver.

30:49.079 --> 30:50.559
We operate in different areas.

30:51.079 --> 30:53.079
The Japanese forbids our contact.

30:53.279 --> 30:54.759
We already asked you

30:54.759 --> 30:56.039
all the questions you asked.

30:56.640 --> 30:57.440
Jiaping?

30:58.240 --> 30:59.640
Why don't you change your perspective

30:59.640 --> 31:00.480
and ask some details

31:00.480 --> 31:01.920
that we haven't expected before.

31:25.960 --> 31:27.640
Have you guys been to other places?

31:28.799 --> 31:31.079
We ate and slept there.

31:31.400 --> 31:32.319
What do they eat then?

31:32.319 --> 31:34.079
Two dishes for lunch, steamed stuffed bun.

31:34.920 --> 31:36.960
And rice porridge rolls in the evening.

31:38.440 --> 31:39.599
One day a week

31:40.160 --> 31:41.319
one day a week.

31:42.279 --> 31:42.920
Then...

31:43.319 --> 31:44.480
Can you see out of the window?

31:46.359 --> 31:48.799
There are a few transom windows.

31:48.799 --> 31:51.160
But all are boarded up.

31:51.960 --> 31:53.240
You can't see anything.

31:53.240 --> 31:54.319
Then...

31:54.960 --> 31:57.799
Did you hear something outside the window?

31:59.240 --> 32:00.200
Sometimes,

32:01.240 --> 32:02.480
It seems that I can hear

32:03.039 --> 32:04.440
when I think back,

32:04.960 --> 32:06.880
It's like the sound of a ship's whistle.

32:07.160 --> 32:08.000
Sirens?

32:09.039 --> 32:10.000
Are there more in summer

32:10.000 --> 32:10.960
In summer or in winter?

32:12.000 --> 32:13.440
You can hear it in summer

32:15.079 --> 32:16.039
In winter,

32:17.240 --> 32:18.279
barely.

32:18.279 --> 32:19.480
And barely audible.

32:20.640 --> 32:21.960
What kind of sound was that?

32:22.640 --> 32:23.519
Do you still remember?

32:28.119 --> 32:29.359
I can't learn it.

32:29.720 --> 32:30.680
How about this, brother?

32:31.119 --> 32:31.920
You come and listen

32:31.920 --> 32:32.640
I'll imitate it.

32:32.640 --> 32:33.240
Alright?

32:36.599 --> 32:37.200
He is...

32:37.599 --> 32:38.000
It's...

32:39.039 --> 32:39.960
Help me think about it.

32:40.440 --> 32:41.559
The number of interruptions

32:42.160 --> 32:43.599
and length of interruptions.

32:43.880 --> 32:45.119
Recall it carefully.

32:45.119 --> 32:46.359
Let's go on.

32:51.640 --> 32:52.440
And

33:08.079 --> 33:09.119
I think

33:09.119 --> 33:10.599
sounds like that.

33:10.599 --> 33:11.759
Are you sure that's it?

33:11.759 --> 33:12.519
I am sure.

33:12.519 --> 33:13.519
Two long tones.

33:41.480 --> 33:42.920
I've located the counterfeit factory.

33:44.319 --> 33:45.119
That's good.

33:45.119 --> 33:45.960
Ten minutes.

33:51.720 --> 33:52.559
Tell me about it.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.440
Sir,

34:00.519 --> 34:01.240
thank you.

34:02.079 --> 34:02.720
Thank you.

34:03.400 --> 34:04.279
Please leave.

34:10.719 --> 34:12.199
Is this how you treat him?

34:14.480 --> 34:15.480
Let me tell you something.

34:16.320 --> 34:17.280
With one condition.

34:17.840 --> 34:19.639
You're not qualified to negotiate terms with us.

34:20.400 --> 34:21.159
He can talk.

34:22.679 --> 34:24.079
Find the counterfeit factory,

34:24.960 --> 34:26.840
will you make a plan to

34:26.840 --> 34:27.679
and destroy it?

34:27.679 --> 34:28.440
Certainly.

34:29.239 --> 34:30.559
But before that,

34:31.079 --> 34:32.480
I need to make sure

34:33.400 --> 34:35.280
you're looking for the right place.

34:35.639 --> 34:37.440
If we want to take action,

34:38.159 --> 34:39.280
left Pair Tao.

34:40.159 --> 34:41.880
Will join your operation or not?

34:42.719 --> 34:43.800
She is

34:44.239 --> 34:45.599
the best special agent.

34:46.039 --> 34:48.679
We hope she can attend it.

34:48.800 --> 34:49.280
Alright.

34:49.599 --> 34:50.519
My term is

34:51.239 --> 34:53.199
I'll take part in the operation together.

34:56.239 --> 34:56.800
Why?

34:57.320 --> 34:58.000
Why?

34:59.039 --> 35:00.800
Of course it's for my wife.

35:01.280 --> 35:02.400
It's such a dangerous operation.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.239
To do such a dangerous operation?

35:04.880 --> 35:06.360
If my wife dies,

35:07.119 --> 35:07.840
If my wife dies?

35:09.679 --> 35:11.840
Haven't we had enough sweet time?

35:12.280 --> 35:15.440
And we've been working hard

35:16.079 --> 35:19.199
to have a son and a half daughter.

35:20.760 --> 35:22.480
We can't let your action

35:22.480 --> 35:24.559
and affect our work.

35:24.840 --> 35:25.880
What are you talking about?

35:26.199 --> 35:27.400
Didn't we agree last night?

35:28.800 --> 35:29.719
Did you really

35:30.519 --> 35:32.159
just for Zuo Shuangtao?

35:32.639 --> 35:33.400
Or what?

35:34.519 --> 35:35.400
Shouldn't a man

35:36.800 --> 35:39.519
a man should sacrifice everything

35:39.920 --> 35:40.960
for the woman you love?

35:41.840 --> 35:43.159
Right, Director Jiang?

35:45.880 --> 35:46.519
Alright.

35:48.039 --> 35:48.880
I promise you.

35:49.760 --> 35:51.400
That's why you've taken so long to talk.

35:51.840 --> 35:53.400
Where is the counterfeit factory?

35:53.639 --> 35:54.519
Don't be anxious.

35:55.400 --> 35:56.360
Tell you everything.

35:57.679 --> 35:58.519
Director Jiang

35:58.519 --> 36:00.719
has passed the serial number of the sewer

36:01.360 --> 36:03.400
and determine a range roughly, right?

36:04.119 --> 36:05.159
That is to say,

36:05.159 --> 36:06.360
Chaoyang Road in Huxi

36:06.840 --> 36:09.800
within 15 minutes' journey

36:10.239 --> 36:11.800
guo Yun also mentioned that

36:11.800 --> 36:13.599
he often heard the sound of ship whistles

36:13.599 --> 36:15.000
In the basement.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
That means

36:16.000 --> 36:16.920
the counterfeit factory

36:18.760 --> 36:20.039
along the Huangpu River,

36:20.440 --> 36:22.360
there are a lot of places near the river.

36:22.360 --> 36:23.000
That's right.

36:23.480 --> 36:24.480
So I asked him about it.

36:24.480 --> 36:25.639
Do you hear it most in summer

36:25.639 --> 36:27.039
In summer or in winter?

36:27.840 --> 36:29.000
We all know

36:29.400 --> 36:30.079
wind

36:31.119 --> 36:32.760
It can spread sound.

36:33.480 --> 36:35.760
The summer wind in Shanghai is southeast.

36:36.079 --> 36:37.119
This proves that

36:37.119 --> 36:38.239
the counterfeit factory

36:38.239 --> 36:40.360
It's at the northwest of Huangpu River.

36:40.679 --> 36:41.400
Certainly,

36:41.639 --> 36:43.880
this is not much different

36:43.880 --> 36:44.719
be the same in essentials while differing in minor points

36:44.719 --> 36:46.079
so I also asked

36:46.400 --> 36:48.679
what kind of sound did Guo Yun hear?

36:49.360 --> 36:50.840
The sounds of the ships are different.

36:50.840 --> 36:51.880
And the intervals

36:52.199 --> 36:53.320
have different meanings.

36:53.960 --> 36:58.280
One tone is short, it means you're coming from the starboard side of the east ship.

36:58.280 --> 37:00.719
Two short voices mean you'll meet from the starboard side of the east ship.

37:00.719 --> 37:01.960
One is long

37:01.960 --> 37:04.639
to leave the berth or pier.

37:04.800 --> 37:05.960
The captain of two songs

37:06.840 --> 37:08.639
for the ship

37:08.639 --> 37:10.840
will go through the lock.

37:11.800 --> 37:13.440
So Guo Yun heard two long tones.

37:13.440 --> 37:14.559
That means

37:15.400 --> 37:16.480
the counterfeit factory

37:16.480 --> 37:18.679
near the ship gate of the Huangpu River.

37:20.719 --> 37:21.519
Jiaping.

37:23.039 --> 37:26.039
You know so much

37:27.719 --> 37:28.880
thank you, honey.

37:29.960 --> 37:30.679
Certainly.

37:31.960 --> 37:34.760
The machines making counterfeit money.

37:34.760 --> 37:35.960
Would make a lot of noise.

37:36.280 --> 37:38.119
If we want to avoid detection,

37:39.000 --> 37:41.079
and other voices to cover it up.

37:41.559 --> 37:42.800
I found this area

37:43.159 --> 37:44.559
It's a factory area,

37:44.559 --> 37:45.800
so I concluded that

37:46.039 --> 37:49.840
the counterfeit factory is hidden beneath this factory area.

37:50.639 --> 37:52.280
This area is all factories.

37:52.920 --> 37:54.440
How can you be sure

37:54.440 --> 37:56.840
the underground of which factory?

37:58.599 --> 38:00.199
There are many factories here,

38:00.760 --> 38:01.880
those with Chinese capital

38:02.360 --> 38:03.760
some are controlled by the Japanese.

38:04.119 --> 38:05.599
However, the Japanese

38:05.840 --> 38:07.760
would choose to be built

38:07.760 --> 38:09.320
In a place controlled by the Japanese.

38:11.039 --> 38:12.280
Two of these factories

38:12.639 --> 38:14.159
are controlled by the Japanese.

38:14.519 --> 38:15.639
One is a chemical factory

38:16.079 --> 38:17.199
the other's a military garment factory.

38:17.840 --> 38:19.360
According to what Guo Yun said,

38:19.719 --> 38:21.280
when he passed through the factory,

38:21.280 --> 38:23.199
he only heard the sound of machinery.

38:23.480 --> 38:25.960
But I didn't smell the chemicals.

38:27.800 --> 38:28.840
So I think

38:29.679 --> 38:30.599
the counterfeit factory

38:31.760 --> 38:33.119
there is a counterfeit

38:34.559 --> 38:35.280
really?

38:36.079 --> 38:38.440
My analysis is very accurate.

38:40.360 --> 38:41.119
However,

38:42.239 --> 38:43.480
everything you said

38:43.480 --> 38:45.360
Is only speculation

38:45.360 --> 38:47.840
If the counterfeit factory is here or not.

38:48.480 --> 38:50.119
Before we act,

38:50.480 --> 38:52.000
before we act.

38:52.400 --> 38:53.000
Alright.

38:53.880 --> 38:54.880
But if Director Jiang

38:55.320 --> 38:56.800
you've just agreed

38:57.079 --> 38:59.000
to join the operation.

38:59.400 --> 39:01.280
I'm a man of my words.

39:02.280 --> 39:03.199
However,

39:03.519 --> 39:06.119
I have another question to ask you.

39:06.880 --> 39:07.599
Please go ahead.

39:08.280 --> 39:10.960
This Japanese military clothing factory

39:11.239 --> 39:13.239
how can we get in?

39:14.960 --> 39:16.679
We followed Zuo Shuangtao last night,

39:16.679 --> 39:19.159
I was told that Juntong has obtained important clues.

39:19.159 --> 39:21.800
With the clue, we may destroy the counterfeit factory at one stroke.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.760
The missing formula and copper plate.

39:23.760 --> 39:25.199
Could be found.

39:25.400 --> 39:27.960
He decided to take part in the raid

39:27.960 --> 39:29.960
In the name of protecting Zuo Shuangtao.

39:30.480 --> 39:31.679
Due to the urgency of the situation,

39:31.679 --> 39:33.119
so the approval was not obtained.

39:33.119 --> 39:34.000
And report it

39:34.000 --> 39:35.679
and report to the organization after taking action.

39:36.000 --> 39:36.840
Four of clubs.

39:39.280 --> 39:41.199
That's very kind of you.

39:41.760 --> 39:43.400
He asked me out for a ride.

39:43.400 --> 39:44.880
It's time to relax.

39:45.519 --> 39:46.119
Brother.

39:46.119 --> 39:47.280
This is what I'm thinking.

39:47.639 --> 39:48.880
Now that Chief Kimura is dead,

39:48.880 --> 39:50.760
little Doudou needs a new owner.

39:51.079 --> 39:53.159
But who else is qualified to ride him

39:53.159 --> 39:54.400
who could ride Little Bean?

39:54.400 --> 39:55.280
Good point.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.440
Bringing a horse is different from riding.

39:59.840 --> 40:01.199
Riding on the horse

40:01.519 --> 40:02.559
they've got better vision

40:02.559 --> 40:04.039
your vision has been broadened too.

40:04.440 --> 40:06.440
The air above is fresh.

40:09.920 --> 40:10.320
Brother.

40:10.719 --> 40:11.800
Enjoy your ride.

40:12.320 --> 40:13.440
And take a walk.

40:13.440 --> 40:14.400
Alright.

40:16.039 --> 40:17.719
Brother.

40:19.199 --> 40:20.519
That's like the Yama King,

40:20.519 --> 40:21.719
another Ma Zhang Fei comes.

40:21.719 --> 40:22.239
Hey.

40:22.239 --> 40:23.800
Brother, slow down.

40:26.159 --> 40:26.400
This...

40:26.880 --> 40:27.519
Brother.

40:27.519 --> 40:28.360
How is it?

40:29.000 --> 40:29.280
What about

40:29.280 --> 40:30.239
don't touch me.

40:30.239 --> 40:30.760
I can do it myself.

40:30.760 --> 40:31.559
Myself.

40:32.800 --> 40:33.599
OK?

40:37.079 --> 40:37.840
Slowly.

40:37.840 --> 40:39.000
I can do it myself.

40:42.360 --> 40:43.400
How is it?

40:43.400 --> 40:44.320
Can I?

40:45.960 --> 40:47.480
The horse ridden by a Japanese

40:48.559 --> 40:49.960
has the same urination

41:10.079 --> 41:10.559
brother.

41:10.559 --> 41:11.960
Please don't be angry.

41:11.960 --> 41:13.280
I'll talk to Little Bean later.

41:13.840 --> 41:15.000
Just ride for a while.

41:16.679 --> 41:17.519
For real?

41:17.519 --> 41:18.599
And got all tangled up.

41:18.599 --> 41:19.320
Brother.

41:19.440 --> 41:20.480
Brother, don't go.

41:20.480 --> 41:21.960
Stand here for a while.

41:24.719 --> 41:25.440
What about

42:09.000 --> 42:09.800
brother, wait!

42:10.239 --> 42:10.599
Brother.

42:10.599 --> 42:11.480
Wait!

42:11.480 --> 42:11.840
Brother.

42:12.079 --> 42:12.519
Hold on.

42:13.519 --> 42:14.239
It's fine.

42:14.239 --> 42:15.159
Go back to your work.

42:15.159 --> 42:15.599
Brother,

42:16.039 --> 42:16.480
brother!

42:16.960 --> 42:18.320
You hurt Little Bean.

42:18.320 --> 42:19.639
You must apologize to it.

42:21.280 --> 42:22.079
It dropped me.

42:22.079 --> 42:23.000
I'll apologize to it.

42:23.360 --> 42:24.079
That works.

42:24.079 --> 42:25.079
Then go back with me.

42:25.079 --> 42:26.400
I'll ask Little Bean to apologize to you.

42:26.400 --> 42:27.519
That's fine.

42:28.599 --> 42:29.719
Brother, how about this?

42:29.719 --> 42:30.639
Go back with me,

42:30.920 --> 42:32.400
I apologize to both of you.

42:32.400 --> 42:33.199
No need.

42:33.199 --> 42:34.440
Get back to work.

42:36.079 --> 42:36.519
Brother.

42:36.519 --> 42:37.920
The three of us must apologize to each other.

42:38.400 --> 42:39.320
Listen to me.

42:39.320 --> 42:40.400
Why should I apologize?

42:40.880 --> 42:41.960
You're my elder brother.

42:41.960 --> 42:43.239
That little bean dropped you.

42:43.239 --> 42:44.559
When you dropped you.

42:44.920 --> 42:46.519
But you made it uncomfortable again.

42:46.519 --> 42:47.840
You should apologize to it.

42:48.119 --> 42:49.920
Then I caused this.

42:49.920 --> 42:51.079
And I raised Little Bean.

42:51.079 --> 42:52.920
So I must apologize to both of you.

42:54.320 --> 42:55.360
You're abnormal?
