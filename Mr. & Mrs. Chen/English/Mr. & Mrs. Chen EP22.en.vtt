02:30.520 --> 02:31.400
President Kimura-san

02:49.680 --> 02:51.360
President Kimura, what are you looking for?

02:51.840 --> 02:53.599
The corpse was untouched.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.400
Why do you cut open the wound?

02:56.719 --> 02:57.280
what

02:57.280 --> 02:58.439
I do not know

03:05.960 --> 03:07.319
Where has the stuff gone?

03:07.439 --> 03:08.520
What is it?

03:08.800 --> 03:10.039
I do not know

03:10.240 --> 03:11.000
lie

03:11.199 --> 03:12.080
Kimura-san

03:12.360 --> 03:13.479
I'm not lying

03:13.840 --> 03:15.919
Why don't you guys believe me?

03:16.800 --> 03:17.680
What are you guys?

03:17.800 --> 03:18.520
There aren't any.

03:18.639 --> 03:19.360
Who else is there?

03:19.639 --> 03:20.719
Did I say it wrong?

03:21.599 --> 03:22.520
No, there's no one else.

03:24.120 --> 03:24.960
I'll tell you.

03:25.840 --> 03:27.719
If you dare to lie

03:28.400 --> 03:29.800
I'll shoot you to death.

03:30.159 --> 03:31.639
Mr. Kimura-san

03:31.639 --> 03:33.319
I'm not lying.

03:34.159 --> 03:35.080
I really didn't lie.

03:36.319 --> 03:37.319
There is one person

03:37.319 --> 03:37.759
Speak up.

03:37.759 --> 03:38.680
There is only one person.

03:39.879 --> 03:40.759
I'm a patient.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.360
I'm just leaving for a moment.

03:42.360 --> 03:43.719
I thought he was a normal patient.

03:43.719 --> 03:45.840
I didn't think that when I found the magpie's corpse,

03:45.840 --> 03:47.719
Suddenly she brought a sword to threaten me.

03:47.719 --> 03:48.599
forced me to ask

03:48.639 --> 03:50.199
What did you bring and ask?

03:50.639 --> 03:52.520
She asked what items were hidden in Xi Qi's corpse.

03:52.520 --> 03:53.960
Am I the one who took it?

03:53.960 --> 03:55.400
I didn't take it.

03:57.080 --> 03:58.159
Where are you

03:58.159 --> 03:58.960
It's here.

03:58.960 --> 03:59.719
Where?

04:00.319 --> 04:01.159
In the room inside

04:03.280 --> 04:04.280
inner room

04:19.600 --> 04:20.519
Chief Kimura

04:20.920 --> 04:22.879
I didn't mean to hide it just now.

04:23.879 --> 04:25.120
That's what I mean.

04:25.800 --> 04:26.319
You know.

04:35.439 --> 04:37.079
It's you.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.319
Zuo Shuang Tao

04:39.319 --> 04:40.040
Kimura-san

04:40.040 --> 04:41.040
Do you know this woman?

04:41.040 --> 04:42.560
His name is Zuo Shuangtao.

04:49.480 --> 04:50.160
Chief Kimura

04:50.160 --> 04:51.759
Just now holding this knife

04:52.600 --> 04:53.480
come threaten me

04:57.480 --> 04:58.800
my war dagger

05:00.079 --> 05:02.439
America gives special military command

05:06.639 --> 05:07.759
Are you the army commander?

05:08.000 --> 05:08.639
Please accept it.

05:10.319 --> 05:12.000
Have you come to investigate the magpie?

05:13.279 --> 05:14.120
yes

05:17.600 --> 05:18.120
Not bad

05:18.120 --> 05:19.040
You are very brave.

05:19.439 --> 05:21.560
Then I ask, where is Xi Que's recipe?

05:22.759 --> 05:24.000
I can't find it

05:25.240 --> 05:27.160
Are you the one who opened the door?

05:28.199 --> 05:29.000
I cut it out myself

05:29.480 --> 05:31.120
But I can't find the formula.

05:31.160 --> 05:32.079
lie

05:33.040 --> 05:34.040
Kimura-san

05:34.279 --> 05:35.399
He definitely wasn't lying.

05:35.399 --> 05:36.319
If you lie

05:36.319 --> 05:38.680
He wouldn't have used that knife to threaten me.

05:39.079 --> 05:39.959
What do you think?

05:51.959 --> 05:54.079
Even though I can't find the formula

05:56.360 --> 05:58.279
But it was unexpectedly profitable.

06:01.079 --> 06:02.160
Kijinzankimura

06:02.680 --> 06:04.839
Today I know there is no way to go.

06:06.879 --> 06:09.040
But I will not tell you a single word.

06:10.160 --> 06:11.800
I'm warning you to avoid this.

06:13.079 --> 06:14.319
You'd better kill me.

06:16.720 --> 06:18.000
You misunderstood me.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.959
I'm not interested in killing people.

06:21.920 --> 06:23.079
Not interesting

06:23.079 --> 06:24.240
not beautiful

06:26.240 --> 06:27.120
Doctor Chiao

06:28.560 --> 06:30.639
Do you know what my dream is?

06:31.279 --> 06:32.000
Probably not you

06:32.000 --> 06:33.079
my dream

06:34.000 --> 06:36.040
I want to be a doctor.

06:36.240 --> 06:36.959
Kimura-san

06:36.959 --> 06:38.879
What field of doctor do you want to be?

06:39.240 --> 06:40.160
surgeon

06:40.160 --> 06:41.319
Main surgeon

06:43.079 --> 06:44.600
Very good

06:45.240 --> 06:46.000
Do you know?

06:46.639 --> 06:47.759
I started having this dream.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.600
Since when did you have this dream?

06:50.279 --> 06:52.120
How am I supposed to know this?

06:52.720 --> 06:54.079
When I was in elementary school

06:54.879 --> 06:56.160
There was a time when I was studying biology.

06:57.360 --> 06:58.800
Dissecting a frog

07:00.079 --> 07:02.519
It's a little frog that still jumps around.

07:02.519 --> 07:04.000
cute little frog

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
I'll use a nail.

07:06.639 --> 07:09.680
Then he took his four claws and nailed them to a piece of wood.

07:10.399 --> 07:13.240
Then he used a blade to cut open his belly.

07:13.240 --> 07:15.000
Then slowly remove the belly.

07:18.680 --> 07:20.480
The nerves inside are twitching.

07:20.759 --> 07:23.279
Hands and feet twitching like crazy.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.360
Nothing can stop it.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.079
My curiosity and enthusiasm for biological sciences

07:33.040 --> 07:34.800
Have you achieved my dream?

07:34.800 --> 07:36.879
How can I help you?

07:37.160 --> 07:37.920
Very easy

07:39.319 --> 07:39.839
Look.

07:40.439 --> 07:41.839
Now we have

07:42.480 --> 07:44.279
Examples of anatomy of a living person

07:45.360 --> 07:46.240
Chief Kimura

07:47.240 --> 07:49.319
Here you will say

07:51.439 --> 07:51.920
you

07:53.439 --> 07:55.639
Go get the clothes the doctor put on me.

07:56.319 --> 07:57.720
The clothes the doctor wears

07:57.720 --> 07:59.560
and surgical equipment as well

07:59.920 --> 08:00.959
Hurry, hurry.

08:01.240 --> 08:01.959
good

08:03.160 --> 08:03.759
I'm going myself.

08:14.879 --> 08:15.639
Tell me.

08:16.279 --> 08:18.319
What is your mission?

08:18.319 --> 08:18.879
I said it.

08:18.879 --> 08:19.920
Where is the boss?

08:19.920 --> 08:21.079
How many people are there in your organization?

08:21.079 --> 08:22.439
Where do you move?

08:22.439 --> 08:23.439
I said it.

08:29.240 --> 08:30.199
You say it.

08:30.439 --> 08:31.199
I listen

08:31.480 --> 08:32.440
I listen

08:32.720 --> 08:34.000
I just want to say

08:35.200 --> 08:37.159
While in this room

08:38.679 --> 08:40.279
It's just someone who is bound.

08:41.759 --> 08:44.000
They are Chinese people who do not resist at all.

08:45.159 --> 08:47.080
But outside this room

08:47.519 --> 08:49.120
On every road

08:50.600 --> 08:52.000
In many households

08:52.600 --> 08:53.440
in shanghai

08:54.320 --> 08:55.000
at the head of the dong

08:55.000 --> 08:56.159
in china

08:56.480 --> 08:58.480
There are still many friends of ours.

08:58.919 --> 09:02.039
They will record your crimes.

09:02.480 --> 09:04.720
Their hearts were filled with anger and anger.

09:06.240 --> 09:08.720
They had weapons clenched tightly.

09:10.320 --> 09:13.000
They will fight until the last minute.

09:20.080 --> 09:22.159
Thousands and thousands of Chinese people

09:23.200 --> 09:25.879
They will all die under my sword.

09:25.879 --> 09:26.799
including you

09:27.240 --> 09:29.039
is just one of them

09:29.799 --> 09:30.360
but

09:30.679 --> 09:31.879
I will let you die

09:33.240 --> 09:34.399
very beautiful

09:34.399 --> 09:35.600
Very beautiful death

10:03.600 --> 10:05.279
What the hell is she doing to her?

10:07.399 --> 10:07.919
It's bad.

10:08.879 --> 10:09.399
this evening

10:09.399 --> 10:11.080
You must have an important mission.

10:11.399 --> 10:13.759
I definitely had to go see that doctor at Shi'an Hospital.

10:19.320 --> 10:20.480
Never mind.

10:20.480 --> 10:22.200
I'd rather not go see President Kimura.

10:22.919 --> 10:24.360
Probably afraid of harsh words again.

10:26.399 --> 10:27.519
cannot

10:27.519 --> 10:28.440
I can't go

10:29.159 --> 10:29.679
If I go

10:29.679 --> 10:31.679
In the future, there will definitely be no chance of meeting Mr. Kijin.

10:33.320 --> 10:34.519
Whatever I say, I have to go.

10:35.120 --> 10:35.960
Anyway, I have to go.

10:36.960 --> 10:38.440
No matter how I force myself, I have to go.

10:43.720 --> 10:44.600
Kimura-san

10:45.159 --> 10:46.399
I'm the backup knife man.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.399
Today I came to see you.

10:48.639 --> 10:50.200
May I have some advice?

10:50.679 --> 10:51.759
It was Xiao Gao.

10:52.679 --> 10:53.240
no

10:53.240 --> 10:54.440
The story of Wutian Xinxuan

10:55.080 --> 10:56.679
I heard that you are going to take Xiao.

10:56.679 --> 10:58.559
Take Zhao Wutian Xinxuan away.

10:58.919 --> 11:00.279
We are very happy.

11:00.559 --> 11:01.240
Meaning

11:01.240 --> 11:03.360
We took good care of Wutian Xinxuan.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.679
Why am I talking about this?

11:09.480 --> 11:10.320
Kimura-san

11:10.600 --> 11:12.120
My meaning is

11:12.120 --> 11:14.440
Would you rather I raise your horse?

11:15.240 --> 11:16.000
You don't have to worry.

11:16.320 --> 11:18.519
I will take care of you like my real child.

11:22.600 --> 11:24.120
Why is my mouth so stupid?

11:29.600 --> 11:31.080
I'm just leaving for a moment.

11:31.279 --> 11:32.679
I thought he was a normal patient.

11:32.720 --> 11:34.840
I didn't think that when I found the magpie's corpse,

11:34.840 --> 11:36.679
Suddenly she brought a sword to threaten me.

11:36.679 --> 11:37.600
Still forced to ask me again

11:37.600 --> 11:38.159
What did you say?

11:38.159 --> 11:38.960
What are you asking?

11:39.879 --> 11:41.799
She asked what items were hidden in Xi Qi's corpse.

11:41.799 --> 11:43.200
Am I the one who took it?

11:43.200 --> 11:44.759
I didn't take it.

11:45.480 --> 11:46.440
Where are you

11:46.440 --> 11:47.240
It's here.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.000
Where?

11:48.559 --> 11:49.360
I'm in the room.

11:57.919 --> 11:58.440
cannot

11:58.879 --> 12:00.080
I can't say this yet.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.559
I'm willing to tone it down like this.

12:01.559 --> 12:02.679
It's easy to get rejected.

12:03.360 --> 12:05.360
My second-in-command is a person of good deeds.

12:07.320 --> 12:08.799
There doesn't seem to be any virtue.

12:10.440 --> 12:11.039
cannot

12:11.039 --> 12:12.159
I need to think a bit.

12:22.360 --> 12:22.840
elder sibling

12:24.399 --> 12:26.559
Go get the clothes the doctor put on me.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.559
The clothes the doctor wears

12:28.559 --> 12:29.360
And then

12:29.360 --> 12:30.399
surgical equipment as well

12:30.600 --> 12:31.639
Hurry, hurry.

12:32.120 --> 12:32.919
good

12:34.039 --> 12:35.080
let me go

12:43.200 --> 12:45.200
Japanese people are perverted.

12:46.399 --> 12:47.600
Even if you don't apply.

12:48.320 --> 12:51.039
There's no need to perform an autopsy on your body alive.

13:28.840 --> 13:30.080
Chen surname

13:40.639 --> 13:42.080
You did this to Zuo Shuangtao.

13:42.559 --> 13:44.519
Don't you know he's my wife?

13:57.360 --> 13:58.240
Guo Guo

13:58.240 --> 13:59.080
I've come.

13:59.840 --> 14:00.840
You don't have to be afraid.

14:01.480 --> 14:02.240
Don't be afraid.

14:11.519 --> 14:12.960
It'll open soon.

14:18.919 --> 14:19.679
You don't have to be afraid.

14:19.919 --> 14:21.039
I've come.

14:21.639 --> 14:22.519
I'm here

14:23.639 --> 14:25.480
I'm here

14:29.519 --> 14:31.159
I've come.

14:31.360 --> 14:31.960
Don't be afraid.

14:33.639 --> 14:34.320
You listen to me.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.080
Now is not the time to cry.

14:36.080 --> 14:36.559
Do you understand?

14:37.000 --> 14:38.519
The two of us must hurry and get out of here.

14:39.080 --> 14:39.879
Do you understand yet?

14:43.360 --> 14:44.120
Look at me.

14:44.840 --> 14:45.559
Let's go.

14:46.360 --> 14:47.080
we go

14:49.240 --> 14:49.759
go

14:50.080 --> 14:51.559
walk slowly

15:06.039 --> 15:06.600
Kimura-san

15:07.360 --> 15:08.080
From today onwards

15:08.360 --> 15:08.759
you are me

15:10.480 --> 15:10.879
Spitting.

15:11.399 --> 15:12.399
What are you talking about me?

15:15.440 --> 15:16.600
sincere

15:21.080 --> 15:21.639
no problem

15:22.360 --> 15:23.320
Let's say it like this.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.120
This time there was definitely no problem.

15:27.679 --> 15:29.480
Why do you have to use secondary skills here?

15:29.480 --> 15:30.519
It's a long story.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.879
But don't let him know that we

15:34.080 --> 15:35.759
I feel sorry for him a little too much.

15:38.000 --> 15:38.919
Chief Kimura

15:39.639 --> 15:40.639
President Kimura-san

15:41.399 --> 15:42.399
I'm in already.

15:47.200 --> 15:48.120
He's gone in.

15:48.919 --> 15:49.639
What should I do?

15:50.519 --> 15:51.360
I don't care about him anymore.

15:52.440 --> 15:53.960
However, he didn't know who had done it.

15:56.440 --> 15:57.200
Is that okay?

15:58.960 --> 16:00.320
Sorry, I'm a bit late.

16:03.399 --> 16:04.559
And what about Doctor Qiao?

16:06.720 --> 16:07.600
Stay behind me.

16:12.440 --> 16:13.519
Don't look.

16:13.799 --> 16:14.679
He's dead.

16:16.240 --> 16:17.639
So strange.

16:19.360 --> 16:21.080
What about my scalpel?

16:21.759 --> 16:22.320
Are you here?

16:29.639 --> 16:31.120
Should have died already

16:33.679 --> 16:34.200
It's bad.

16:34.879 --> 16:35.720
Why?

16:35.720 --> 16:37.159
My scarf fell inside.

16:38.559 --> 16:39.559
Every day I wear it to the bank.

16:39.559 --> 16:41.000
He'll definitely remember.

16:41.279 --> 16:41.879
Where did you fall?

16:44.559 --> 16:45.360
on the table

16:51.000 --> 16:52.039
This is not true.

16:53.720 --> 16:55.120
I must be blindsided.

16:55.759 --> 16:56.320
Hallucinations

16:59.759 --> 17:00.600
Saw all the hallucinations

17:02.360 --> 17:04.319
It must have been because I used my brain too much just now.

17:04.599 --> 17:05.759
I saw a hallucination.

17:07.079 --> 17:08.200
Why is he sitting in front of the door?

17:21.480 --> 17:22.279
It's a person.

17:22.559 --> 17:23.599
What are you doing?

17:25.319 --> 17:26.640
I'd like to sit here first.

17:27.079 --> 17:28.279
After a while, I'll go back.

17:28.839 --> 17:30.359
Everything became normal again.

17:32.920 --> 17:34.680
Why is there a knife in your hand?

17:39.240 --> 17:40.000
Lieutenant Chen

17:40.640 --> 17:41.319
Why did you get it?

17:41.680 --> 17:43.720
I'm him.

17:43.759 --> 17:44.839
What's wrong with you?

17:45.400 --> 17:46.279
To be so afraid

17:46.640 --> 17:47.799
What is it about him?

17:50.440 --> 17:51.440
Secondary weapon

17:51.920 --> 17:53.079
Do you want me to work?

17:53.680 --> 17:55.200
When performing your duties, speak quickly.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.319
I'm not going in anymore.

17:56.799 --> 17:57.640
It's so scary.

18:08.599 --> 18:09.640
Chief Kimura

18:09.960 --> 18:10.559
Kimura

18:14.440 --> 18:16.000
this

18:23.240 --> 18:24.119
What happened here?

18:25.559 --> 18:27.039
Why did Captain Kimura die?

18:27.880 --> 18:28.799
I understand.

18:29.680 --> 18:31.200
You are a criminal who kills people.

18:32.839 --> 18:33.799
no

18:40.119 --> 18:40.799
you watch

18:41.079 --> 18:42.240
Cut corners sharply

18:42.880 --> 18:44.240
The relationship was cut off.

18:44.640 --> 18:45.759
The partition wall was smooth.

18:47.680 --> 18:50.880
And there were no abrasions on his forehead.

18:51.480 --> 18:52.680
Plus there are abrasions on the skin.

18:55.599 --> 18:56.400
Second knife

18:56.880 --> 18:59.519
Captain Kimura's wound was caused by a sharp knife.

18:59.880 --> 19:02.480
The weapon is the scalpel in your hand just now.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.480
There must have been blood stains on the knife.

19:05.480 --> 19:07.400
It is easy to prove whether it is Mr. Kimura's or not.

19:07.400 --> 19:08.079
The most important thing is

19:08.079 --> 19:09.720
There's your fingerprint on that knife.

19:10.599 --> 19:12.519
Now there is complete evidence and witnesses.

19:14.640 --> 19:16.000
Are you still making excuses for me?

19:17.839 --> 19:18.400
Boss Chen

19:18.599 --> 19:19.920
Why do you slander people like this?

19:20.160 --> 19:22.319
I just picked up this knife here.

19:22.319 --> 19:23.160
Two handles

19:23.599 --> 19:24.920
I heard that President Kimura

19:24.920 --> 19:27.119
During this time I want to take away the horse you raised.

19:27.440 --> 19:28.880
There are many thoughts in your heart.

19:28.880 --> 19:30.720
You will say that there is resentment in your heart.

19:30.759 --> 19:32.240
This is your motivation for killing people.

19:32.240 --> 19:33.200
Boss Chen

19:33.200 --> 19:35.160
Nuts are very important to me.

19:35.359 --> 19:37.119
But I wouldn't kill anyone for it.

19:37.160 --> 19:38.880
I don't want to doubt you.

19:39.119 --> 19:40.640
After all, we are colleagues.

19:40.920 --> 19:42.200
But what method do I have?

19:42.559 --> 19:43.759
You appear on the scene.

19:43.759 --> 19:44.799
use weapons in hand

19:44.799 --> 19:46.559
Most importantly, you have a motive for killing people.

19:46.559 --> 19:47.839
How can you keep me from doubting you?

19:48.279 --> 19:49.759
I'm used to being second-back.

19:49.960 --> 19:50.599
I

19:50.640 --> 19:51.160
but

19:51.160 --> 19:52.960
But this mistake is really big.

19:52.960 --> 19:54.279
I can't carry it anymore.

19:55.240 --> 19:56.599
Er, this one.

19:57.359 --> 19:59.559
Is this your fault?

20:03.319 --> 20:05.000
Go with me to Sararup HQ.

20:06.400 --> 20:07.200
Got there.

20:07.599 --> 20:09.559
There is a reasonable explanation.

20:10.400 --> 20:11.000
Let's go.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.000
Someone has arrived.

20:19.000 --> 20:19.759
There are people

20:20.240 --> 20:20.839
Go.

20:20.839 --> 20:21.559
Boss Chen

20:21.559 --> 20:22.720
I don't want anyone to know.

20:22.720 --> 20:23.400
I dodge

21:00.799 --> 21:01.640
Can't bear it.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.039
The first pot in the world

21:06.279 --> 21:07.480
I really can't bear it.

21:09.319 --> 21:10.240
Hallucinations

21:10.759 --> 21:11.720
Hallucination again

21:12.559 --> 21:13.440
I'm not afraid

21:14.160 --> 21:15.000
Bodhisattva protection

21:15.440 --> 21:16.440
May God protect you too.

21:18.160 --> 21:19.000
Lieutenant Chen

21:19.599 --> 21:20.759
you are the same

21:21.319 --> 21:23.079
You're not even in front of me.

21:24.799 --> 21:25.640
Do you have a feeling?

21:27.599 --> 21:29.480
Do you have a feeling? That's a hallucination.

21:31.759 --> 21:32.279
sit up

21:39.240 --> 21:39.880
Look.

21:41.319 --> 21:42.240
You didn't forget, right?

21:44.160 --> 21:45.960
You've made a big mistake.

21:45.960 --> 21:47.000
Do you know?

21:47.480 --> 21:48.160
Boss Chen

21:49.119 --> 21:50.759
I didn't actually kill Chief Kimura.

21:52.000 --> 21:52.880
yes

21:53.799 --> 21:55.440
Maybe it's really not you.

21:56.160 --> 21:57.920
Then you really killed him.

21:58.480 --> 22:00.839
What if you are possessed by a vengeful spirit?

22:01.079 --> 22:02.319
That day when he dragged the corpse

22:02.319 --> 22:03.119
I've already told you.

22:03.119 --> 22:05.640
This way, you will often be possessed by a vengeful spirit.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.720
Or am I really possessed?

22:17.839 --> 22:18.720
Hey, friend.

22:19.759 --> 22:21.160
When you faint

22:22.000 --> 22:24.440
Originally, I had planned to call the S Communications Headquarters.

22:24.920 --> 22:26.480
Let them come and catch people.

22:28.160 --> 22:29.720
I picked up the phone

22:30.599 --> 22:32.240
Then I suddenly thought of

22:33.160 --> 22:35.319
For many years we have been doing business.

22:37.799 --> 22:38.720
Even though

22:38.960 --> 22:40.400
You are Zhao An's subordinate.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.160
But normally

22:42.920 --> 22:44.240
This doesn't cause me much distress.

22:44.480 --> 22:45.119
Is that right?

22:45.640 --> 22:47.240
And then most importantly

22:48.119 --> 22:49.519
I think you

22:50.680 --> 22:51.759
Not a bad person

22:54.920 --> 22:56.640
So I hung up the phone.

22:58.759 --> 22:59.920
I just can't stand it.

23:00.440 --> 23:01.839
At least we used to be colleagues.

23:01.960 --> 23:02.640
Is that right?

23:03.119 --> 23:05.400
I thought I would help my friend.

23:05.680 --> 23:06.559
Take this matter.

23:11.119 --> 23:11.839
Never mind.

23:11.839 --> 23:12.440
friend

23:12.640 --> 23:13.240
It's like this.

23:13.920 --> 23:15.759
I, myself, can only help with this.

23:16.200 --> 23:18.039
Because today you are Japanese.

23:18.079 --> 23:19.519
So if Japanese people meet them

23:19.519 --> 23:20.160
I'm in danger too.

23:20.200 --> 23:21.200
I can't help you anymore.

23:21.680 --> 23:22.359
I'll go first.

23:22.359 --> 23:23.279
You find your own way.

23:23.279 --> 23:24.200
Lieutenant Chen

23:24.200 --> 23:24.960
You must help me.

23:25.079 --> 23:26.119
Lieutenant Chen

23:26.119 --> 23:27.000
Think of a way to help me.

23:27.000 --> 23:27.480
Lieutenant Chen

23:27.480 --> 23:28.599
I'm begging you.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.079
Whatever you say, I will obey you.

23:30.079 --> 23:30.480
can?

23:30.480 --> 23:31.200
Boss Chen

23:31.200 --> 23:32.559
Get up

23:37.640 --> 23:39.279
You bully me for being soft-hearted.

23:39.279 --> 23:40.119
I'll tell you.

23:40.880 --> 23:41.519
Let me think first.

23:41.519 --> 23:42.799
Let me think about it.

23:43.680 --> 23:44.480
Hurry and tell me.

23:44.480 --> 23:46.160
How did you get to the hospital?

23:50.279 --> 23:52.400
Originally, today I wanted to go to Saraming Headquarters.

23:52.519 --> 23:53.559
Chief Kimura

23:54.119 --> 23:55.880
Please don't take the beans with you.

23:57.160 --> 23:58.599
Waited at the door for a long time.

23:59.119 --> 24:00.960
It wasn't easy for Chief Kimura to come out.

24:01.599 --> 24:03.480
I didn't know how to say it.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.319
Wait for me to breathe quickly

24:05.519 --> 24:07.440
Chief Kimura's car has already been driven.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.240
So I chased after his car.

24:10.480 --> 24:12.440
Then he ran to the front door of Shi'an Hospital.

24:13.240 --> 24:16.319
I saw President Kimura enter the cardiology department.

24:16.880 --> 24:18.000
After hesitating many times

24:18.480 --> 24:20.039
I finally thought of something to say.

24:20.559 --> 24:22.079
I'm going to see President Kimura.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.599
Wait for me to push the door out.

24:25.079 --> 24:27.240
Saw someone outside first.

24:28.160 --> 24:29.000
I'm afraid.

24:29.240 --> 24:30.720
shouted Chief Kimura.

24:31.359 --> 24:32.440
But no one answered.

24:32.759 --> 24:34.400
Do I think something might happen?

24:35.519 --> 24:36.799
In my heart I'm afraid

24:37.519 --> 24:40.079
I saw a scalpel in the room.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.799
So I want to keep it to protect myself.

24:43.119 --> 24:44.039
you know

24:44.319 --> 24:45.559
I raised Xiao Gao myself.

24:45.559 --> 24:47.160
I was afraid that my two swords would pierce it.

24:47.319 --> 24:48.839
I didn't dare take my sword with me.

24:50.359 --> 24:51.400
The story after this

24:52.640 --> 24:53.559
Do you know it all?

24:54.160 --> 24:55.319
I say friend

24:55.640 --> 24:57.039
You have done inappropriate things over and over again.

24:57.039 --> 24:58.720
That is, pick up that knife.

24:59.119 --> 24:59.920
Really naive

25:02.720 --> 25:04.319
Let me think about what to do first.

25:10.759 --> 25:11.400
Look.

25:12.319 --> 25:13.839
one two three

25:14.759 --> 25:15.559
three corpses

25:16.400 --> 25:17.359
Kimura-san

25:17.920 --> 25:18.799
No need to recommend much.

25:18.960 --> 25:19.640
Is that right?

25:21.039 --> 25:21.960
This doctor

25:22.400 --> 25:25.200
He is a doctor who specializes in heart disease.

25:25.640 --> 25:26.920
But he still has one more person who is.

25:27.640 --> 25:29.400
is Captain Kimura's spy.

25:30.160 --> 25:30.920
Is that a spy?

25:32.559 --> 25:33.480
How do you know?

25:34.519 --> 25:35.079
I'll tell you something.

25:35.079 --> 25:36.640
Lucky you found me

25:36.640 --> 25:38.359
Think about how you would thank me.

25:46.559 --> 25:47.160
Is it an arrest warrant?

25:48.160 --> 25:50.000
I found it on that doctor's desk.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.079
You try looking at this picture.

25:53.519 --> 25:54.960
Then you slowly turn around and look at this person.

25:59.160 --> 26:00.400
This code is magpie.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.920
Isn't that the corpse that's sitting?

26:02.960 --> 26:03.480
yes

26:08.720 --> 26:09.359
friend

26:11.519 --> 26:13.599
The person who died today was Jian Shan of Kimura Village.

26:13.599 --> 26:14.759
Kimura Kenzan

26:15.599 --> 26:17.559
If the command department finds out

26:17.559 --> 26:19.119
That's a big deal, you know?

26:20.160 --> 26:20.759
so

26:21.640 --> 26:22.839
So we must

26:23.720 --> 26:25.160
You must use your hands to move at the scene.

26:26.039 --> 26:27.799
to the people of the military headquarters

26:27.799 --> 26:29.319
I think the story is like this.

26:29.759 --> 26:30.240
good

26:32.000 --> 26:33.119
Xi Que

26:33.119 --> 26:34.039
Stir repeatedly

26:34.599 --> 26:35.839
But he has heart disease.

26:35.839 --> 26:36.880
So he came to the hospital.

26:36.880 --> 26:38.720
So the heart department had the doctor prescribe medicine.

26:41.680 --> 26:42.720
But he didn't think that

26:42.720 --> 26:44.359
This doctor is a spy for Lord Kimura.

26:44.839 --> 26:46.160
He remembered the criminal.

26:46.440 --> 26:48.680
Therefore, he found an opportunity to inform Chief Kimura.

26:49.240 --> 26:52.319
When the doctor tried to stabilize the magpie

26:52.359 --> 26:53.799
then injected into the solution

26:53.799 --> 26:55.039
I don't know what to put in it.

26:55.720 --> 26:57.920
Probably because of an overdose of drugs.

26:58.039 --> 26:59.400
causing his unexpected death.

27:02.039 --> 27:02.559
younger brother

27:02.559 --> 27:03.920
These things are difficult to explain.

27:03.920 --> 27:05.599
But from now on, you'll have to listen carefully.

27:05.640 --> 27:06.359
Do you understand yet?

27:06.519 --> 27:08.400
Because Kijinzankimura was about to go on stage.

27:09.279 --> 27:10.519
After Lord Kimura came

27:10.519 --> 27:11.359
I saw Xi Que.

27:12.000 --> 27:12.799
Already dead

27:13.039 --> 27:13.920
but on him

27:13.920 --> 27:15.519
Couldn't find the information he wanted.

27:15.799 --> 27:17.000
So he thought he was a doctor.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.200
Stealing his information

27:18.480 --> 27:20.599
Pulled out a gun and was angry and wanted to kill that guy.

27:20.880 --> 27:21.799
But what about the doctor?

27:21.799 --> 27:22.759
Protect it first.

27:22.960 --> 27:25.160
He hid a scalpel in his sleeve.

27:25.920 --> 27:26.960
I need to find a scalpel.

27:39.319 --> 27:42.599
At the same time, President Kimura picked up a gun and had to shoot.

27:43.039 --> 27:45.079
The doctor scratched Lord Kimura's arm.

27:47.240 --> 27:48.039
What will you do?

27:48.200 --> 27:49.200
this is my hand

27:49.440 --> 27:50.519
You hit the kli on the roof of the wooden village.

27:51.160 --> 27:52.000
I'm sorry.

27:57.160 --> 27:59.720
The doctor then seized the opportunity when Lord Takeshimura wasn't expecting it.

27:59.720 --> 28:02.200
Then he stabbed an unsuspecting bystander in the neck with a single knife.

28:02.880 --> 28:04.000
But Commander Kimura

28:04.000 --> 28:06.400
It is Zhong Zhuo of the Japanese Empire.

28:06.960 --> 28:08.640
Why was it so easily picked up?

28:09.000 --> 28:09.640
so

28:09.640 --> 28:11.440
Captain Kimura endures severe pain.

28:11.680 --> 28:13.200
and fight with the doctor

28:14.480 --> 28:15.160
Brother, from now on

28:15.680 --> 28:16.799
Come hit the bed here.

28:20.400 --> 28:20.839
not enough

28:24.000 --> 28:24.480
good

28:26.400 --> 28:27.000
last

28:27.400 --> 28:28.319
Kimura-san

28:28.319 --> 28:30.680
He fought over the scalpel that the doctor had.

28:33.519 --> 28:34.640
The doctor died instantly.

28:35.400 --> 28:37.799
Chief Kimura lost too much blood.

28:38.160 --> 28:39.759
Finally, it was poured into a pool of blood.

28:40.960 --> 28:42.240
and both die

28:46.880 --> 28:47.599
friend

28:49.079 --> 28:49.559
I

28:49.559 --> 28:52.400
There's probably only this way.

28:58.000 --> 28:58.720
Boss Chen

28:59.400 --> 29:00.599
Thank you very much today.

29:01.039 --> 29:02.400
Otherwise I probably would.

29:05.920 --> 29:06.720
It's not.

29:07.680 --> 29:08.799
I suddenly remembered.

29:08.799 --> 29:10.200
Why are you here?

29:10.519 --> 29:11.720
I came to pick up medicine.

29:12.119 --> 29:12.480
It's this late.

29:12.799 --> 29:14.559
It's this late and I came to get medicine.

29:18.799 --> 29:19.880
My wife has a fever

29:19.880 --> 29:21.240
I'll go get some medicine.

29:23.720 --> 29:24.279
Then you take the medicine.

29:24.279 --> 29:25.559
So why are you running here?

29:25.559 --> 29:27.079
You think I want to come to the scene here.

29:27.079 --> 29:28.480
You think I want to see this happen?

29:29.359 --> 29:30.880
I saw you sneaking around the door.

29:30.880 --> 29:31.599
I want to come and see

29:31.599 --> 29:32.880
What exactly are you doing?

29:34.000 --> 29:35.400
Were you at the scene too?

29:35.400 --> 29:36.440
Why do people doubt me?

29:36.440 --> 29:37.480
No.

29:38.759 --> 29:40.119
Why must you stare at me like this?

29:40.599 --> 29:42.200
Now I'm helping you.

29:42.319 --> 29:44.200
Plus, you have a motive for killing people.

29:44.519 --> 29:46.079
There's your fingerprint on it.

29:47.319 --> 29:48.680
Has Boss Chen forgotten?

29:49.079 --> 29:50.680
Just now when the scene was set

29:50.839 --> 29:53.400
I'm using a pad here.

29:56.640 --> 29:57.160
yes

29:58.079 --> 29:59.160
So you forgot?

29:59.400 --> 30:01.359
This knife was taken from this cart.

30:03.079 --> 30:03.839
That handle of yours

30:05.720 --> 30:06.440
It's here with me.

30:07.960 --> 30:08.599
What's up?

30:10.000 --> 30:10.920
Boss Chen

30:11.960 --> 30:13.000
this is you

30:13.000 --> 30:13.759
What's wrong with me?

30:14.359 --> 30:15.279
What's the matter?

30:15.279 --> 30:17.200
You are my benefactor.

30:18.119 --> 30:19.720
my real parents

30:20.400 --> 30:21.480
Just remember that.

30:22.359 --> 30:23.079
Boss Chen

30:23.839 --> 30:25.000
From now on

30:25.279 --> 30:26.640
We will be in the same boat.

30:27.240 --> 30:27.720
no

30:28.759 --> 30:29.920
You have to think clearly.

30:30.519 --> 30:31.799
I am a person on a boat

30:32.039 --> 30:33.720
As for you, you are the one who is about to drown.

30:33.960 --> 30:35.039
You're just lucky.

30:35.039 --> 30:36.240
Hold on to my ship

30:36.240 --> 30:37.920
Just begging me to save your life.

30:37.960 --> 30:38.640
Do you understand?

30:38.839 --> 30:39.559
but

30:39.759 --> 30:42.279
I could always kick you off the boat.

30:44.759 --> 30:45.000
There's more.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.240
I'll tell you something, old man.

30:46.720 --> 30:48.480
Me helping you isn't free.

30:48.799 --> 30:50.039
From now on

30:50.799 --> 30:52.799
On the surface, you were still Zhao An's subordinate.

30:53.440 --> 30:54.920
But the truth worked for me.

30:55.200 --> 30:56.480
What do I have you do next?

30:56.480 --> 30:57.319
You just have to do it.

30:57.319 --> 30:58.240
But you don't ask me.

30:58.240 --> 30:59.279
Why do you do this?

30:59.279 --> 31:00.359
You mustn't tell anyone else.

31:00.359 --> 31:01.559
What have I commanded you to do?

31:01.759 --> 31:02.559
Do you understand?

31:03.240 --> 31:03.880
understand

31:04.839 --> 31:06.880
If you still don't understand even a little bit.

31:07.440 --> 31:08.480
So this knife

31:08.680 --> 31:10.839
Appear in the evidence room

31:10.839 --> 31:11.640
in the evidence room

31:14.200 --> 31:15.119
Then Chief Chen

31:15.920 --> 31:16.759
So from now on

31:16.799 --> 31:18.920
Are you going to make me do something bad?

31:26.400 --> 31:27.000
friend

31:28.400 --> 31:30.039
Good story or bad story?

31:30.839 --> 31:32.319
Later you will know.

31:36.000 --> 31:36.519
Let's go.

31:38.160 --> 31:39.599
I will go with you

31:39.599 --> 31:40.960
Why did you follow me?

31:41.680 --> 31:42.599
Have you finished work?

31:42.599 --> 31:43.400
Then go back.

31:44.440 --> 31:46.440
I've finished decorating the place, haven't I?

31:46.559 --> 31:47.759
What are you decorating?

31:48.279 --> 31:49.720
If something goes wrong

31:49.720 --> 31:50.880
Are there any footprints here?

31:50.880 --> 31:52.119
Are there any other footprints?

31:52.119 --> 31:53.119
Didn't think of that?

31:53.119 --> 31:54.119
You must redecorate.

31:54.119 --> 31:55.759
As I said, isn't it?

31:55.759 --> 31:56.599
I'll tell you.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.759
It's only for the military headquarters.

31:58.920 --> 32:00.079
no loopholes

32:00.319 --> 32:01.039
The case is closed.

32:02.039 --> 32:03.359
You will be safe, do you understand?

32:03.359 --> 32:04.759
understand

32:04.759 --> 32:05.480
That is,

32:05.839 --> 32:06.920
So I'm alone.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.680
Until when do I have to do it?

32:08.960 --> 32:10.799
Whatever you want to do, just do it.

32:10.799 --> 32:11.720
Well, I'll tell you.

32:11.720 --> 32:12.519
6 a.m.

32:12.519 --> 32:13.920
The cleaners come and clean themselves.

32:18.079 --> 32:18.880
Lieutenant Chen can relax.

32:18.920 --> 32:19.640
Turn your volume down a bit.

32:21.079 --> 32:22.480
Wrapped around my two handles

32:23.279 --> 32:23.920
Come back nicely.

32:52.519 --> 32:53.359
Is it better?

33:00.000 --> 33:01.119
Tell me honestly

33:02.039 --> 33:03.279
What exactly is the group?

33:03.480 --> 33:04.880
Didn't I say that before?

33:05.319 --> 33:06.319
Blood Spirit Group

33:06.440 --> 33:07.839
Youth patriotic organization

33:08.440 --> 33:10.240
Zuo Shuangtao, are you still lying to me?

33:10.519 --> 33:12.279
I was at the door, hearing it clearly.

33:12.279 --> 33:14.079
You have already admitted that you are the commander of the army.

33:15.680 --> 33:16.880
Are you really the commander of the army?

33:17.480 --> 33:18.759
You've heard it all, haven't you?

33:19.240 --> 33:20.480
Why are you still asking me?

33:26.559 --> 33:28.039
A real military uniform.

33:31.119 --> 33:32.200
I can't think of it at all.

33:32.240 --> 33:32.759
that

33:33.119 --> 33:35.480
The Chen family's wife never expected to be the leader of the army.

33:36.359 --> 33:36.880
Many years ago

33:36.880 --> 33:37.640
I'm careful

33:37.640 --> 33:38.599
Be careful with your words and actions.

33:38.599 --> 33:39.799
I'm wary of setting out on a ten-thousand-year-old ship.

33:39.799 --> 33:41.519
But now I don't think so.

33:41.640 --> 33:44.119
I'm just a boat full of dynamite.

33:44.119 --> 33:45.480
So what do you plan to do?

33:46.359 --> 33:47.240
Complain to me

33:51.400 --> 33:52.519
mean person

33:53.680 --> 33:54.519
I complain to you

33:55.519 --> 33:56.519
If I want to complain to you

33:56.519 --> 33:57.359
So why should I help you?

33:57.359 --> 33:58.240
I complain to you

34:00.119 --> 34:02.119
But just now, when you massacred Mu

34:03.359 --> 34:04.359
Even if it's in our military system

34:04.359 --> 34:05.359
It is a first-class skill.

34:05.559 --> 34:06.640
Where did you come to study?

34:07.079 --> 34:08.639
When combined with everything else

34:10.480 --> 34:11.559
But I don't believe it.

34:11.559 --> 34:14.000
You are just a traitor.

34:16.800 --> 34:18.239
Or are you just a lurker?

34:20.360 --> 34:21.480
belongs to another line

34:22.559 --> 34:23.320
or

34:25.079 --> 34:25.960
Press conference

34:26.159 --> 34:28.079
Now I'm asking you:

34:28.519 --> 34:29.199
Why did you turn around?

34:29.199 --> 34:30.599
Why did you come to ask me?

34:31.119 --> 34:31.960
Tell me the truth.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.639
What exactly is your purpose in going to the hospital?

34:33.639 --> 34:34.440
What's the mission?

34:36.239 --> 34:38.559
You think I'm going to tell you my mission?

34:38.960 --> 34:39.920
You think I want to know?

34:39.920 --> 34:41.400
What is your work?

34:41.800 --> 34:43.440
Knowing what good it will have for me

34:43.719 --> 34:44.840
I also help you

34:44.840 --> 34:46.440
I do it for myself.

34:47.159 --> 34:48.599
Do you know who I killed today?

34:50.159 --> 34:51.400
Kimura Kenzan

34:51.559 --> 34:53.840
Head of the Intelligence Unit of the Military Police Command

34:55.360 --> 34:56.039
yes

34:56.360 --> 34:57.239
Now I

34:57.840 --> 34:59.480
This time I threatened another pawn.

34:59.519 --> 35:00.239
Is it right?

35:00.400 --> 35:01.840
at the scene

35:02.039 --> 35:05.400
and causing doctors to kill each other

35:06.039 --> 35:07.679
But what if I make a mistake?

35:08.079 --> 35:09.800
What if I didn't expect anything?

35:10.280 --> 35:12.159
Aren't we both finished playing?

35:12.440 --> 35:13.480
Where is it?

35:13.480 --> 35:15.760
That's someone from the military headquarters.

35:15.760 --> 35:17.880
The Sharing Headquarters was not in a position to find fault with this.

35:18.360 --> 35:19.559
So I told you that Zuo Shuangtao

35:20.199 --> 35:21.360
You must tell me.

35:22.079 --> 35:24.079
You must tell all the circumstances of the job.

35:24.280 --> 35:25.599
This is how I thought of it.

35:25.599 --> 35:27.000
How will I face it next?

35:27.159 --> 35:29.199
We are going to face this no matter what.

35:29.679 --> 35:30.360
Speak quickly.

35:33.119 --> 35:34.239
My duty is

35:34.800 --> 35:36.960
Investigate the traitor who once hid in the army.

35:37.239 --> 35:39.400
that concealed a certain Yan

35:39.800 --> 35:41.480
What is the purpose of investigating magpies?

35:43.840 --> 35:46.719
He stole the Sullian paper recipe.

35:48.840 --> 35:49.559
Is that a formula?

35:50.679 --> 35:51.719
Have you received the medicine formula yet?

35:53.360 --> 35:53.880
do not have

35:56.760 --> 35:57.559
Zuo Shuang Tao

35:58.440 --> 35:59.880
Do you still have something to hide from me?

36:00.199 --> 36:00.800
I'll tell you.

36:00.800 --> 36:01.719
If you don't tell the truth again

36:01.719 --> 36:03.559
Both of us will be stuck with reality.

36:03.639 --> 36:04.840
I'm not lying

36:07.960 --> 36:10.719
I suspect that Xi Que hid this medicinal formula in the wound.

36:11.079 --> 36:12.760
So I used the dagger to cut it.

36:13.159 --> 36:14.400
But I can't find it

36:14.840 --> 36:16.679
But I found a piece of tissue paper.

36:17.280 --> 36:18.840
This proves that my decision was not wrong.

36:20.760 --> 36:21.760
only

36:24.639 --> 36:26.679
Someone must have picked it up before.

36:28.320 --> 36:29.360
has been taken away

36:30.559 --> 36:31.440
So it's because of the magpie.

36:31.440 --> 36:33.159
Have you given the medicine formula to someone?

36:35.480 --> 36:35.840
Zuo Shuang Tao

36:35.840 --> 36:37.559
You still haven't told me the truth, have you?

36:37.840 --> 36:38.599
I'll tell you

36:38.639 --> 36:39.760
I am not interested

36:39.760 --> 36:41.239
I don't care in the slightest.

36:41.239 --> 36:42.760
Perhaps the exchange has already been completed.

36:43.760 --> 36:44.480
What's the exchange?

36:45.519 --> 36:47.760
Chongqing sent people to negotiate with Xi Qi.

36:48.480 --> 36:51.440
Thinking of spending a lot of money to buy that formula?

36:54.039 --> 36:55.000
Chongqing

36:56.280 --> 36:59.039
Chongqing, why use a paper formula made from coins?

37:01.039 --> 37:02.559
They want to counterfeit coins.

37:04.119 --> 37:06.119
Destroying the economy and finances of border areas

37:12.280 --> 37:14.519
But when it's finished

37:14.519 --> 37:16.719
Why did you still send me to look for the magpie?

37:19.880 --> 37:22.360
They thought of getting rid of Xi Que before exchanging.

37:22.599 --> 37:23.519
and take the formula back

37:23.599 --> 37:25.360
But their previous actions had failed.

37:25.440 --> 37:27.679
My superior ordered the mission to be halted.

37:32.320 --> 37:33.159
Hasn't it stopped completely?

37:33.159 --> 37:34.679
So what are you doing today?

37:34.679 --> 37:35.639
Zuo Shuang Tao

37:36.480 --> 37:37.960
I decided to disobey orders.

37:39.079 --> 37:40.880
I had to get the medicine formula back first.

37:44.400 --> 37:45.159
traitor

37:46.159 --> 37:47.480
You're a traitor.

37:47.719 --> 37:50.519
You are clearly the actions of a rebel organization.

37:50.559 --> 37:51.360
I know

37:52.440 --> 37:53.519
But do you know?

37:55.079 --> 37:56.559
counterfeit coins

37:57.159 --> 37:59.159
is to destroy the anti-Japanese plot

38:00.000 --> 38:00.639
It's because of disrespect.

38:00.639 --> 38:03.320
that opposes the sacrifice of the Japanese people

38:07.400 --> 38:08.199
okay

38:08.199 --> 38:09.079
Zuo Shuang Tao

38:09.079 --> 38:11.079
You are not only a spy in the royal court.

38:12.360 --> 38:13.679
You still sympathize.

38:14.039 --> 38:15.800
and also supports the Communist Party

38:16.800 --> 38:17.920
Do you know what this is called?

38:18.679 --> 38:19.639
The penalty is doubled.

38:20.159 --> 38:21.360
How do you support CCP?

38:22.639 --> 38:23.800
I began to feel

38:25.280 --> 38:27.159
Perhaps the CCP's ideas and beliefs

38:27.880 --> 38:29.639
It is the right way for China's future.

38:29.760 --> 38:32.079
What are you talking about so far?

38:32.199 --> 38:32.840
If it's true

38:32.840 --> 38:34.159
I dare say

38:34.159 --> 38:34.960
Okay.

38:35.480 --> 38:36.480
I don't want to listen anymore.

38:36.639 --> 38:37.840
-You don't have to talk about these things with me.-Don't.

38:38.519 --> 38:40.519
The clues you said

38:40.519 --> 38:41.719
I remember it all.

38:41.719 --> 38:42.760
Let me think carefully first.

38:42.760 --> 38:43.519
Think carefully.

38:43.519 --> 38:44.480
See what flaws there are.

38:44.880 --> 38:46.159
Hurry and sleep.

38:46.519 --> 38:47.480
One more thing, I'll tell you.

38:48.199 --> 38:49.679
Tomorrow the two of us will go to work.

38:49.960 --> 38:51.639
You have to act like you don't see anything happening.

38:52.840 --> 38:53.800
Everything is normal.

38:57.880 --> 38:58.599
wait a minute

38:58.599 --> 38:59.199
Is there something wrong?

39:01.199 --> 39:02.239
What are you going to do?

39:03.239 --> 39:04.360
Today I'm here to help you.

39:04.360 --> 39:05.360
You can't kill me.

39:05.639 --> 39:05.960
I am

39:05.960 --> 39:06.719
I am a traitor

39:06.719 --> 39:09.280
But I didn't do anything bad.

39:09.400 --> 39:11.000
What I'm talking to you about today

39:11.519 --> 39:13.360
If you dare to say even one word

39:18.880 --> 39:20.000
I don't speak

39:20.320 --> 39:20.840
You trust me.

39:20.840 --> 39:21.280
I definitely won't tell.

39:21.280 --> 39:22.519
I definitely won't tell anyone.

39:23.320 --> 39:24.599
I'm not kidding.

39:24.599 --> 39:26.840
I'm not kidding.

39:27.280 --> 39:28.199
I'll tell you.

39:29.280 --> 39:30.800
This type of dagger used by US soldiers

39:30.800 --> 39:32.199
There are four handles at home.

39:32.559 --> 39:34.760
There is also a Blanning M 1935 pistol.

39:34.760 --> 39:36.000
One Curtin pistol

39:36.440 --> 39:38.199
who had to assassinate the foreign minister instead of Chen Zhu

39:38.440 --> 39:39.440
must use it

39:40.000 --> 39:42.239
There are still three US Army MK grenades.

39:42.400 --> 39:43.639
a bottle of cyanide

39:43.639 --> 39:45.920
Poisoning of the 5th Japanese Guangzhou Navy team.

39:46.079 --> 39:47.679
It caused the death of 19 people like that.

39:47.679 --> 39:48.119
Don't.

39:48.679 --> 39:49.280
Okay.

39:49.559 --> 39:50.159
I

39:50.159 --> 39:51.119
I don't want to know about these things.

39:51.119 --> 39:52.280
I don't want to know about these things.

39:52.960 --> 39:55.039
I'm the one who helped you, I'm in the middle of my wits.

39:55.039 --> 39:55.800
Because I love you

39:55.800 --> 39:56.800
What am I?

39:56.800 --> 39:57.920
You trust me.

39:57.920 --> 39:58.519
okay

39:58.719 --> 39:59.239
can

40:02.320 --> 40:03.039
Come here.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
Why do I go in?

40:05.239 --> 40:06.199
sleep together

40:06.760 --> 40:08.159
Why do we have to sleep together?

40:08.360 --> 40:10.199
Husband and wife don't sleep together?

40:11.159 --> 40:12.159
Not at this time.

40:12.920 --> 40:14.199
Aren't you sleeping separately?

40:14.440 --> 40:15.679
Today you helped me

40:16.800 --> 40:17.800
I have forgiven you.

40:17.960 --> 40:18.519
do not

40:19.360 --> 40:19.840
come

40:28.199 --> 40:28.760
no

40:29.159 --> 40:29.960
Kua kua kua kua kua kua kua kua kua kua

40:30.159 --> 40:31.159
You wouldn't have taken advantage of me while I was asleep.

40:31.159 --> 40:32.199
When I sleep

40:38.039 --> 40:38.800
Jiaping

40:40.719 --> 40:42.440
If I really died today

40:44.760 --> 40:45.920
will you miss me

40:47.199 --> 40:48.000
Think about it.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.800
I thought for a long time.

40:53.679 --> 40:54.760
Because of that

40:56.119 --> 40:57.880
Even if you do it for me

40:59.239 --> 41:00.639
Take good care of yourself.

41:02.400 --> 41:03.639
look after yourself

41:04.119 --> 41:06.760
If we're to blame, blame the era we're living in right now.

41:08.199 --> 41:09.079
Blame the Japanese

41:10.079 --> 41:11.639
Why must there be a war?

41:13.000 --> 41:15.119
I remember you said just now

41:16.360 --> 41:18.159
CCP beliefs and ideas

41:19.719 --> 41:21.039
Even if it is the future of China

41:24.239 --> 41:25.360
Are you serious?

41:30.159 --> 41:31.000
Actually

41:32.840 --> 41:34.960
I secretly read Lao Lu's investigation report.

41:38.119 --> 41:39.679
I found their beliefs

41:42.519 --> 41:43.679
To have power

41:45.280 --> 41:46.280
There is hope.

41:47.719 --> 41:49.039
They were willing to die and not give up.

41:51.440 --> 41:52.679
A couple worthy of admiration

41:53.920 --> 41:55.760
We must live a good life.

41:57.320 --> 41:58.519
I just want to be alive.

41:59.199 --> 42:00.280
Even if there is hope

42:02.159 --> 42:03.000
Promise me

42:06.440 --> 42:08.280
I will not do anything wrong to the Chinese people.

42:09.559 --> 42:10.639
I will remember

42:31.440 --> 42:32.880
Are you sure that person is a magpie?

42:34.039 --> 42:34.960
Most definitely.

42:35.559 --> 42:37.119
I have ordered you to stop your mission.

42:37.119 --> 42:38.480
Why do you have to stalk him?

42:40.639 --> 42:41.840
I don't want to let it go easily.

42:42.880 --> 42:44.519
Because you don't want to give up easily, right?

42:45.159 --> 42:46.360
There is no other motivation.
