01:43.640 --> 01:45.719
Why don't I feel like you miss me?

01:46.200 --> 01:47.719
There is an important business.

01:48.879 --> 01:50.159
This secret document

01:50.159 --> 01:51.840
You have to sign it before it can be saved.

02:00.920 --> 02:02.079
What is it?

02:02.680 --> 02:04.840
(Are the Japanese going to start killing the Chinese?)

02:06.560 --> 02:09.319
Did the Japanese ever stop killing Chinese?

02:09.719 --> 02:11.319
Then do we all have to die?

02:11.319 --> 02:12.919
What are you nervous for?

02:13.039 --> 02:14.240
It's not our turn

02:14.400 --> 02:15.159
tetapi Chen Jia Ping

02:15.159 --> 02:16.919
also work for Japanese?

02:17.240 --> 02:18.879
Yesterday they were so cruel to him,

02:19.280 --> 02:20.479
do you think one day,

02:20.479 --> 02:21.919
will we all end?

02:22.439 --> 02:23.919
Chen Jia Ping deserved it.

02:24.080 --> 02:25.800
Who told him to be Luo Guan Qun's person.

02:26.800 --> 02:27.960
Commander Luo too.

02:28.159 --> 02:28.840
According to you, he was then

02:28.840 --> 02:30.840
mysteriously stores japonica rice

02:31.000 --> 02:32.879
and also a beautiful dream of getting big profits.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.960
Who would have thought that it was a Japanese reserve food.

02:36.360 --> 02:37.280
Now that's good

02:37.520 --> 02:39.360
rats crossed the street, everyone shouted hit

02:40.000 --> 02:41.800
become like this

02:44.800 --> 02:46.000
in your heart

02:47.439 --> 02:49.159
You think about Luo

02:49.639 --> 02:51.360
I'm afraid he will trouble me.

02:57.800 --> 03:00.159
I'm afraid I won't meet you.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.000
Just think about it.

03:02.120 --> 03:04.400
If the Japanese attack me again,

03:04.520 --> 03:06.599
then I will definitely be involved.

03:07.199 --> 03:08.240
Is it possible?

03:08.680 --> 03:10.840
Why would the Japanese want to harm me?

03:11.120 --> 03:13.680
Luo Guanqun was now a hollow bullet.

03:15.360 --> 03:16.520
So,

03:16.960 --> 03:19.080
You have to go with the Japanese well.

03:19.280 --> 03:21.240
Don't worry me anymore.

03:21.639 --> 03:23.639
You only worry about the useless things?

03:25.199 --> 03:26.240
My place...

03:26.479 --> 03:28.759
Is the money warehouse of the Japanese military headquarters.

03:29.159 --> 03:30.599
If the Japanese lack anyone,

03:30.719 --> 03:31.960
I will not lack.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.960
I miss you.

03:41.800 --> 03:43.479
Who told you to do it again?

03:43.759 --> 03:45.000
He's good, I'm good.

03:46.319 --> 03:47.080
Sis.

03:49.639 --> 03:50.759
Busy.

03:54.159 --> 03:55.159
Not busy anymore

03:57.639 --> 03:59.159
No, you'll be busy for a while.

03:59.759 --> 04:01.240
I don't have time to be busy anymore.

04:01.360 --> 04:02.759
We walk again.

04:03.159 --> 04:04.120
When did you come?

04:05.400 --> 04:05.719
Mrs. Luo,

04:05.719 --> 04:06.319
sister-in-law.

04:08.000 --> 04:08.840
Thank You

04:25.839 --> 04:27.079
tuan Pierre

04:27.959 --> 04:29.759
safe deposit box renter

04:29.759 --> 04:31.279
already not available

04:31.480 --> 04:33.000
after confirming the contents

04:33.000 --> 04:34.439
what we want.

04:35.759 --> 04:38.560
What I promised I would definitely do.

05:03.040 --> 05:04.680
You should know I do like this

05:05.160 --> 05:07.160
take big risks

05:09.160 --> 05:10.279
I understand.

05:10.959 --> 05:12.079
Happy working together.

05:15.319 --> 05:15.920
Go ahead.

05:39.360 --> 05:39.959
Robbery.

05:40.079 --> 05:41.079
Robber?

05:42.839 --> 05:44.600
Everyone squats, squats.

06:08.519 --> 06:09.360
Robber?

06:10.199 --> 06:10.920
There

06:15.319 --> 06:16.279
hug the head.

06:17.160 --> 06:17.720
Squat!

06:17.720 --> 06:18.879
Both hands hold the head.

06:21.639 --> 06:23.000
I announced

06:23.279 --> 06:24.639
From now on

06:24.879 --> 06:26.920
every thing here

06:27.399 --> 06:28.759
mine

06:29.000 --> 06:31.079
now please cooperate.

06:31.480 --> 06:33.040
Return all my belongings

06:33.399 --> 06:34.480
give it all back to me.

06:34.480 --> 06:35.360
My brother.

06:35.639 --> 06:36.920
Do you want to rob?

06:37.079 --> 06:37.839
Here is the bank

06:37.839 --> 06:39.279
you guys should rob the bank.

06:39.519 --> 06:40.839
We are ordinary people,

06:40.839 --> 06:41.600
Do not talk too much.

06:41.720 --> 06:42.560
Citizen...

06:42.720 --> 06:44.120
People save money here.

06:44.439 --> 06:45.839
Don't think I don't know.

06:46.040 --> 06:47.879
America and Japan will most likely go to war.

06:48.040 --> 06:49.879
The rich people in the concession want to escape

06:50.000 --> 06:51.680
you guys also came to discuss money?

06:51.680 --> 06:52.480
Where is the money?

06:55.160 --> 06:55.439
Wallet

06:55.439 --> 06:56.439
Money

06:57.160 --> 06:58.680
money, money.

07:00.000 --> 07:00.639
That.

07:01.720 --> 07:02.439
That.

07:03.040 --> 07:04.720
This is a personal letter,

07:04.720 --> 07:06.800
worthless, the money has already been given to you.

07:08.240 --> 07:09.040
My brother.

07:10.040 --> 07:10.879
Look, just a letter.

07:10.879 --> 07:11.600
Worthless.

07:11.600 --> 07:12.439
Personal letter?

07:12.439 --> 07:14.240
Why does it have a bank sign on it?

07:15.920 --> 07:17.120
Give me the letter.

07:22.199 --> 07:22.879
Sis.

07:27.959 --> 07:29.439
I told you.

07:30.120 --> 07:31.879
Every item here

07:32.560 --> 07:34.319
mine.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.040
Yours, yours.

07:41.279 --> 07:42.480
Everything is yours.

07:43.040 --> 07:43.959
Sorry

07:50.040 --> 07:50.680
street

07:52.319 --> 07:53.079
Where's the knife?

07:53.079 --> 07:54.079
Is it in the body?

07:54.160 --> 07:54.800
Ada.

07:55.360 --> 07:56.879
Dragon tooth on the left, cold moon on the right.

07:57.000 --> 07:57.639
Which one do you want?

07:57.639 --> 07:59.199
What is the difference?

08:22.480 --> 08:23.480
Don't shoot

08:23.920 --> 08:24.759
do not move

08:26.759 --> 08:27.519
do not move.

08:27.639 --> 08:28.519
Do not move.

08:28.720 --> 08:29.600
You let him go.

08:29.720 --> 08:30.759
Otherwise, I will kill him.

08:30.759 --> 08:31.800
You let him go.

08:31.800 --> 08:33.240
Or I will kill him

08:33.399 --> 08:34.440
see if your knife is faster,

08:34.440 --> 08:35.360
or am I dying faster?

08:35.360 --> 08:37.200
Brother, calm down.

08:37.919 --> 08:38.919
You guys are asking for money, I know.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.320
We don't need to see blood.

08:40.679 --> 08:42.679
I just want to take my envelope back.

08:42.679 --> 08:43.799
Our boss already said,

08:43.799 --> 08:44.840
all items are here

08:44.840 --> 08:46.200
everything is yours.

08:46.759 --> 08:47.720
You misunderstood.

08:47.799 --> 08:48.720
The money is yours

08:48.720 --> 08:50.279
I don't want a penny.

08:50.559 --> 08:52.840
I just want to reply to my letter

08:53.320 --> 08:54.240
good or not?

08:54.679 --> 08:56.440
You're not lying, I just need to believe.

08:56.440 --> 08:57.600
If I lie,

08:57.879 --> 08:59.039
you kill him.

09:00.879 --> 09:01.679
Let him take it.

09:02.320 --> 09:03.159
Good.

09:03.159 --> 09:04.240
You go get it yourself.

09:04.240 --> 09:05.360
Don't mess around.

09:05.440 --> 09:06.120
Thank You

09:06.440 --> 09:08.279
I want the envelope

09:19.360 --> 09:20.159
squat

09:21.960 --> 09:22.799
down

09:27.679 --> 09:28.799
the police came out of the police station

09:29.080 --> 09:30.480
lower the weapon

10:02.480 --> 10:03.799
go

10:06.639 --> 10:07.240
run quickly!

10:14.200 --> 10:14.799
Run quickly!

10:17.519 --> 10:18.240
My money!

10:18.679 --> 10:19.279
Enter.

10:21.600 --> 10:22.360
Do not move.

10:22.360 --> 10:23.639
go away

10:25.799 --> 10:27.960
Hurry up.

10:46.080 --> 10:46.960
Pak!

10:47.360 --> 10:48.480
We are not robbers.

10:48.799 --> 10:49.559
Not a robber?

10:49.559 --> 10:50.039
Correct.

10:50.679 --> 10:52.039
So why are you holding a knife?

10:53.039 --> 10:54.360
That is my knife.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.360
Your sword

10:56.919 --> 10:58.559
then you are a conspirator.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.240
Catch them both!

11:04.399 --> 11:08.320
These two people were originally Japanese officials.

11:09.600 --> 11:10.200
No.

11:10.639 --> 11:11.600
Gentlemen

11:12.200 --> 11:13.679
hello, welcome to the french concession

11:13.679 --> 11:15.919
I am Liu Cheng, police chief in the French concession

11:16.039 --> 11:17.679
you can call me Chengzi

11:18.679 --> 11:19.519
chengzi.

11:19.519 --> 11:21.000
We lost something important,

11:21.080 --> 11:21.840
I know.

11:22.039 --> 11:23.600
Everyone here is losing stuff.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.200
You line up outside

11:25.200 --> 11:26.240
what is missing?

11:26.240 --> 11:27.360
How much is it worth?

11:27.480 --> 11:28.320
Register everything.

11:28.519 --> 11:29.519
I threw away an envelope.

11:29.519 --> 11:31.120
It contains very important items.

11:31.120 --> 11:32.879
I was taken away by the two masked robbers.

11:32.879 --> 11:34.799
Catch those two robbers now!

11:34.799 --> 11:35.639
Leave!

11:35.799 --> 11:37.360
Don't panic, you've seen it too.

11:37.360 --> 11:38.879
We don't have enough people here.

11:39.159 --> 11:40.440
To catch robbers with you,

11:40.440 --> 11:40.799
So,

11:40.799 --> 11:41.960
what about these people?

11:42.000 --> 11:42.840
Moreover

11:43.200 --> 11:44.159
and there are also Americans.

11:44.399 --> 11:45.399
And France.

11:46.159 --> 11:47.840
We must prioritize serving them.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.200
The envelope was not found.

11:50.320 --> 11:51.600
Angered the Japanese,

11:51.600 --> 11:53.600
your life is also not peaceful.

12:07.679 --> 12:09.399
Because everything is difficult,

12:09.879 --> 12:12.240
we are helpless.

12:12.679 --> 12:14.000
We are also helpless.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Helpless.

12:15.159 --> 12:16.200
Helpless.

12:16.559 --> 12:17.679
I have the ability.

12:17.679 --> 12:18.360
We go get him.

12:18.360 --> 12:18.639
Road.

12:18.639 --> 12:19.600
Do not run

12:20.200 --> 12:21.240
I told you

12:21.240 --> 12:22.559
line out.

12:23.679 --> 12:25.080
I don't want any more money.

12:25.799 --> 12:27.879
Now it's not a question of money anymore

12:28.080 --> 12:29.399
I suspect you

12:29.399 --> 12:31.000
you're posing as a customer,

12:31.000 --> 12:33.120
cooperate with the robbers

12:34.159 --> 12:35.879
I have to investigate you well.

12:36.720 --> 12:37.799
I'll say it again.

12:38.000 --> 12:38.799
You two.

12:40.000 --> 12:40.759
Line up.

12:47.679 --> 12:49.000
Help me remember.

12:50.960 --> 12:51.720
Line up

13:00.960 --> 13:01.840
lackey

13:54.639 --> 13:55.840
So

13:56.559 --> 13:58.080
do you take it after peeing?

13:58.759 --> 14:00.399
How could it be?

14:02.320 --> 14:03.960
I'm going to pee after taking it.

14:10.399 --> 14:11.159
Brandy,

14:11.159 --> 14:12.120
French stuff?

14:19.799 --> 14:20.919
In the letter

14:20.919 --> 14:22.399
what are you actually putting?

14:28.080 --> 14:29.480
Can't I not ask again?

14:30.919 --> 14:32.360
I've known you for so long,

14:32.360 --> 14:34.159
Now more and more you don't understand.

14:34.159 --> 14:36.159
What is your job actually?

14:36.519 --> 14:37.320
Chengzi,

14:38.519 --> 14:39.399
don't ask too many questions.

14:40.240 --> 14:41.240
My original intention has not changed,

14:41.320 --> 14:42.720
we are together against Japan.

14:44.320 --> 14:45.600
If you think back, against Japan...

14:45.600 --> 14:47.720
The funds released now are becoming more and more insufficient.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.240
Today I'm looking for two robbers

14:49.320 --> 14:51.559
good craftsmanship, great acting skills.

14:51.559 --> 14:52.879
This all costs money.

14:52.919 --> 14:54.279
OK, got it.

14:55.159 --> 14:56.200
Two more days

14:56.480 --> 14:58.919
I'll take care of a pile of Japanese cotton cloth

14:59.279 --> 15:01.039
Later I will give you two more boxes.

15:01.240 --> 15:01.840
Wait.

15:03.240 --> 15:05.159
You said that before, okay?

15:06.759 --> 15:07.399
Is it true?

15:08.200 --> 15:08.960
Did I ever say that?

15:08.960 --> 15:09.759
Didn't say it?

15:11.960 --> 15:13.000
Driving?

15:13.200 --> 15:14.200
It's better not to drink beer.

15:14.279 --> 15:15.039
Go ahead.

15:16.840 --> 15:18.200
A ghost who believes in you.

15:37.159 --> 15:38.919
Lost the letters

15:39.440 --> 15:42.159
so now I want to go to the merchant to find information,

15:42.159 --> 15:43.200
not possible anymore.

15:44.559 --> 15:47.519
No more clues about fighters and secret letters.

15:48.120 --> 15:49.960
It means

15:49.960 --> 15:51.679
the mission had failed miserably.

16:28.080 --> 16:28.840
Do not run

16:31.240 --> 16:32.279
Where is he?

16:32.519 --> 16:33.840
There isn't any. No one.

16:33.840 --> 16:35.159
If there's no one, why are you running?

16:35.159 --> 16:36.679
There was a girl looking for me earlier,

16:36.679 --> 16:37.919
he gave me the fare.

16:37.919 --> 16:39.240
Told me to take an empty taxi.

16:39.360 --> 16:40.080
He didn't go up.

17:20.759 --> 17:21.759
Left twin.

17:22.480 --> 17:23.240
Say it.

17:24.119 --> 17:26.359
Since when did you become a member of the military?

17:34.200 --> 17:35.440
Thank you Miss.

17:35.960 --> 17:36.960
I'll do it myself.

17:38.279 --> 17:39.240
Then I went to buy vegetables.

17:39.240 --> 17:40.200
You guys wait for me for a moment.

17:40.559 --> 17:41.640
Thank You.

18:06.359 --> 18:07.160
What is it?

18:07.400 --> 18:08.440
Tonight,

18:09.160 --> 18:10.440
we have to go.

18:10.759 --> 18:11.720
before leaving

18:11.960 --> 18:13.519
this woman must be killed

18:14.240 --> 18:16.359
if it weren't for him we might have died

18:16.799 --> 18:19.119
a special agent of a special class is looking for us nearby.

18:19.279 --> 18:21.279
This woman has seen our faces.

18:22.960 --> 18:24.599
How can you be sure

18:24.839 --> 18:26.759
he will surely betray us?

18:27.000 --> 18:28.880
We have to bring our personal data back.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.440
For this mission

18:30.519 --> 18:32.279
We are willing to do everything possible

18:41.920 --> 18:43.440
So what's your plan?

18:54.319 --> 18:55.759
How? Isn't it delicious?

18:56.599 --> 18:57.400
Very delicious.

18:57.400 --> 18:58.400
Very delicious.

18:59.200 --> 19:01.400
My boyfriend has never eaten my cooking.

19:02.079 --> 19:03.720
So, where is Miss Zuo's boyfriend?

19:05.799 --> 19:06.599
He ran away.

19:09.880 --> 19:11.039
This time,

19:11.039 --> 19:12.559
all thanks to Miss Zuo.

19:12.640 --> 19:13.559
These several days,

19:13.559 --> 19:14.680
we are afraid,

19:15.279 --> 19:17.000
if Miss Zuo comes,

19:17.440 --> 19:18.960
we will disturb him,

19:19.680 --> 19:20.640
won't

19:21.359 --> 19:22.279
have eaten?

19:25.960 --> 19:27.319
My girlfriend has run away

19:27.400 --> 19:28.680
schools are also closed.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.599
All the students dispersed

19:30.920 --> 19:31.640
So,

19:31.920 --> 19:33.359
no one will come here.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.640
You know, we're wanted.

19:35.640 --> 19:37.279
If anyone suspects us,

19:37.799 --> 19:39.000
just calm down,

19:39.079 --> 19:40.200
Your problem is healing wounds here,

19:40.200 --> 19:41.200
I didn't tell anyone.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.519
And some days there are too many vegetables.

19:43.720 --> 19:45.880
I also deliberately changed some of the vegetable markets.

19:46.119 --> 19:47.559
So no one will be suspicious.

19:48.319 --> 19:49.240
That's good.

19:57.960 --> 19:59.440
What do you mean?

19:59.440 --> 20:00.920
I consider you a hero.

20:00.920 --> 20:02.720
Why do you have to take revenge?

20:02.720 --> 20:04.759
Let's just say you made a sacrifice for the resistance against Japan.

20:05.880 --> 20:07.240
Left twin peach.

20:07.599 --> 20:08.880
I ask you,

20:09.160 --> 20:11.160
Since when did you join the army?

20:11.440 --> 20:12.680
What are you guys saying?

20:13.720 --> 20:15.519
I never joined the army.

20:15.720 --> 20:16.720
Who are you?

20:17.240 --> 20:18.839
Why do you want to kidnap me?

20:25.119 --> 20:26.599
I warned you

20:26.720 --> 20:28.480
You joined the army a year ago

20:29.160 --> 20:30.079
right?

20:37.559 --> 20:38.640
Shocked, right?

20:42.240 --> 20:43.599
This person is a traitor.

20:44.519 --> 20:45.640
This time the action unfolds,

20:45.640 --> 20:46.920
betrayed by him

20:47.599 --> 20:48.799
this time following me,

20:48.799 --> 20:50.440
Want me to lure more people,

20:50.680 --> 20:52.039
to catch us all.

20:57.079 --> 20:58.400
I hate traitors the most,

21:00.000 --> 21:02.400
my parents were killed by traitors!

21:04.720 --> 21:07.319
I'm Liu Wuchang from the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Action Committee.

21:07.319 --> 21:08.720
I hope you can join us.

21:08.880 --> 21:10.960
Together against Japan, together to kill traitors.

21:13.599 --> 21:14.359
Me.

21:14.720 --> 21:16.279
You're smart and alert,

21:16.519 --> 21:17.559
one heart rebelled against Japan.

21:17.759 --> 21:19.160
is the person we need.

21:30.839 --> 21:31.880
Left twin peach.

21:32.480 --> 21:34.119
This time you come to Shanghai,

21:34.119 --> 21:36.240
are you on a mission to kill soldiers at the foot of the mountain?

21:36.240 --> 21:38.119
I don't know what you guys are talking about.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.680
I told you I'm here to look for my girlfriend

21:41.000 --> 21:43.480
Don't you know I'm not local?

21:58.000 --> 21:59.400
I asked again.

21:59.440 --> 22:01.759
Did you come to Shanghai to kill the warrior at the foot of the mountain?

22:01.839 --> 22:02.720
Say.

22:02.880 --> 22:04.480
Who are you actually?

22:05.200 --> 22:06.799
If you want money,

22:07.039 --> 22:08.440
you can look for my uncle.

22:08.440 --> 22:09.839
He's very rich,

22:10.720 --> 22:12.720
Don't you want a ransom?

22:14.160 --> 22:15.079
Order.

22:24.440 --> 22:25.279
Jia Ping

22:27.279 --> 22:28.440
why did you just come home from work?

22:28.720 --> 22:29.799
Isn't this overtime?

22:30.000 --> 22:30.920
At the end of the month,

22:30.920 --> 22:33.000
so many report documents.

22:33.359 --> 22:34.119
How about you?

22:34.920 --> 22:36.559
Didn't I come back

22:36.559 --> 22:37.799
bring the sweater I knitted for you?

22:37.839 --> 22:38.799
Left behind at the office

22:38.799 --> 22:39.960
still needs to be repaired.

22:40.440 --> 22:41.920
Today I'm really sorry.

22:42.480 --> 22:44.759
Actually, Guoguo is not what you think.

22:44.759 --> 22:46.039
Do not take it to heart.

22:46.400 --> 22:48.039
I understand.

22:56.079 --> 22:57.559
I'm working overtime

22:57.559 --> 22:59.440
Lu Fang came to get things.

22:59.680 --> 23:01.200
You can't make a fuss

23:02.720 --> 23:03.480
Ping family

23:04.200 --> 23:05.160
Because

23:05.160 --> 23:06.519
your boyfriend is coming to pick you up,

23:06.680 --> 23:07.799
I won't bother you anymore.

23:08.039 --> 23:08.880
I go first.

23:16.000 --> 23:16.759
Guoguo.

23:17.519 --> 23:18.880
You have to continue to maintain the atmosphere.

23:18.960 --> 23:20.559
Keep angry, keep storming.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.000
What's wrong with you?

23:46.799 --> 23:48.319
If you don't believe me,

23:49.799 --> 23:51.799
why still send me to perform tasks?

23:52.559 --> 23:53.920
Your mission failed,

23:54.079 --> 23:55.519
lost contact with the organization.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.240
A situation like this

23:57.680 --> 23:58.920
between sacrifices

23:59.200 --> 24:00.319
or betray

24:01.400 --> 24:04.039
when you persuaded me to join the army,

24:05.279 --> 24:06.720
You once told me someone in the organization

24:06.720 --> 24:08.799
we've often been friends.

24:09.480 --> 24:12.079
Is this what you mean by honest and selfless?

24:23.319 --> 24:25.519
You still want to send me to continue the mission?

24:26.640 --> 24:27.759
How did you know?

24:29.480 --> 24:31.680
Earlier when he called me he was using a phone book pad

24:34.000 --> 24:35.680
fear of having a scar.

24:36.039 --> 24:38.359
So it's suspected that there are scars?

24:39.200 --> 24:41.559
Our two peaches are still so smart.

24:45.119 --> 24:45.960
Xiao Wu Lai.

24:46.160 --> 24:46.960
You guys go out first.

24:46.960 --> 24:48.359
There's something I want to say to the Left Twin.

24:48.599 --> 24:49.079
Good.

25:07.920 --> 25:09.839
Your analysis of the secret letter is very good.

25:10.400 --> 25:12.319
I will report to Guan Yongshan.

25:13.960 --> 25:15.960
Unfortunately we don't have the chance anymore.

25:16.240 --> 25:18.480
No, we still have a chance.

25:29.680 --> 25:30.279
This is

25:30.279 --> 25:31.880
the recent one

25:32.240 --> 25:33.279
just received it.

25:33.799 --> 25:35.319
The identity of the sender is unknown,

25:35.720 --> 25:36.720
but very clear

25:36.720 --> 25:38.480
they've found our television station

25:38.920 --> 25:41.160
and also report to us on the same frequency

25:41.759 --> 25:43.920
This is the password for changing positions

25:45.400 --> 25:46.839
encryption method like this

25:47.720 --> 25:48.880
people rarely use it.

25:49.799 --> 25:50.839
So you can be sure,

25:50.960 --> 25:52.759
they still don't know our latest password.

25:52.839 --> 25:54.400
It shouldn't be our person

25:57.759 --> 25:58.839
has it been solved yet?

25:59.079 --> 25:59.839
it's been solved

26:00.200 --> 26:02.079
above is written

26:02.160 --> 26:04.240
password has not been retrieved

26:04.440 --> 26:07.039
The secret letter is still in the hands of the foot of the mountain.

26:07.720 --> 26:10.079
Is this a trap from the foot of the mountain?

26:10.200 --> 26:11.240
I do not think so.

26:11.759 --> 26:13.839
If under the mountain finds our radio station,

26:14.039 --> 26:16.119
he can immediately find our communications station

26:16.720 --> 26:18.079
directly search for our communications station.

26:18.359 --> 26:19.880
If this is the case, our blow will be bigger

26:20.200 --> 26:22.279
there's no need to set a trap like this

26:22.559 --> 26:24.319
this person really understands the foot of the mountain

26:25.480 --> 26:27.160
and also deliberately helps us.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.000
Who's he?

26:29.640 --> 26:30.920
But no matter who he is,

26:31.240 --> 26:32.400
as far as I know,

26:32.880 --> 26:34.440
This information is reliable

26:36.920 --> 26:39.079
but now I can't go back to the business shop anymore.

26:39.880 --> 26:41.640
Especially meeting people under the mountain

26:42.880 --> 26:44.680
I see you are worried about Chen Jia Ping, right?

26:45.079 --> 26:46.079
No

26:47.200 --> 26:48.319
you also know

26:49.279 --> 26:50.720
I hate traitors the most,

26:51.039 --> 26:53.039
there is nothing better, according to your wishes.

26:53.160 --> 26:54.240
After the mission is completed,

26:54.240 --> 26:56.079
you can kill this bastard!

26:57.039 --> 26:58.519
You must always remind yourself.

26:58.960 --> 27:00.720
Chen Jiaping works for the Japanese.

27:00.720 --> 27:01.920
He is our enemy

27:02.160 --> 27:03.240
you should know,

27:03.920 --> 27:06.319
Your unexpected meeting is a golden opportunity.

27:06.880 --> 27:08.640
You have to make the best use of it.

27:08.640 --> 27:10.000
Taking advantage of that intelligence post

27:10.279 --> 27:11.640
to complete our task.

27:12.759 --> 27:13.920
Xiao Hu is dead.

27:15.440 --> 27:16.960
Da Xuan is also dead.

27:19.160 --> 27:20.640
But until now

27:21.640 --> 27:23.839
You didn't mention them a word

27:24.640 --> 27:26.839
in your mouth there is only a mission.

27:27.160 --> 27:27.960
Task.

27:28.319 --> 27:28.839
Mission.

27:28.839 --> 27:30.279
Left twin, stand up.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.440
Do you still remember your identity?

27:33.599 --> 27:35.680
Commissioner General Su Zhou and Zhejiang.

27:35.680 --> 27:36.920
What is our slogan?

27:36.960 --> 27:38.519
Gathering the will to defend the leader.

27:38.519 --> 27:39.480
Raise your voice a little.

27:39.480 --> 27:41.279
Gathering the will to defend the leader.

27:41.279 --> 27:41.880
Very good.

27:42.039 --> 27:43.000
You have to remember.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.240
We have no reason to back down.

27:45.359 --> 27:48.000
Making sacrifices is difficult and scary

27:48.119 --> 27:50.359
will only make us stronger and braver

27:50.799 --> 27:51.440
personal feelings

27:51.440 --> 27:53.079
more cannot be the shackles of the future

27:53.680 --> 27:54.480
Good.

27:58.480 --> 27:59.720
Don't be afraid of being suspected.

28:01.160 --> 28:02.559
In the intelligence department like this

28:02.799 --> 28:04.640
there is no one beyond suspicion.

28:05.519 --> 28:07.680
I believe you can solve this problem,

28:08.000 --> 28:10.200
Do you still remember the words I said to you?

28:10.319 --> 28:11.759
when taking you away from Nanjing?

28:15.759 --> 28:16.559
Say it.

28:18.240 --> 28:21.000
You can help me realize my dream of fighting Japan and saving the country.

28:21.160 --> 28:21.759
Correct.

28:22.599 --> 28:24.440
Everything you do now

28:25.279 --> 28:27.480
is to make your dreams come true

28:30.839 --> 28:31.920
jia Ping

28:32.680 --> 28:35.160
I am wrong. I shouldn't have troubled you.

28:35.480 --> 28:37.519
I shouldn't have asked to break up with you either.

28:37.799 --> 28:39.759
Obviously I don't pay enough attention to you,

28:39.759 --> 28:41.079
but instead it hinders other people.

28:41.559 --> 28:43.400
I'm really selfish.

28:46.519 --> 28:47.319
Guoguo.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.920
What drama are you acting in?

28:50.599 --> 28:51.599
Besides, didn't I tell you,

28:51.599 --> 28:53.039
don't come to business looking for me?

28:55.519 --> 28:57.759
Didn't I come here to admit my mistake?

28:58.160 --> 28:59.759
Why admit mistakes?

29:00.160 --> 29:01.680
Shouldn't we continue?

29:02.480 --> 29:04.279
continue to maintain a state of cold war?

29:04.400 --> 29:06.160
Otherwise it won't end forever

29:08.839 --> 29:10.559
and why is your hair like this?

29:12.200 --> 29:14.119
But I want to stay by your side.

29:15.720 --> 29:17.359
Just like before.

29:17.359 --> 29:18.440
Is it possible?

29:21.079 --> 29:22.079
I'm begging you.

29:45.039 --> 29:46.079
After returning

29:46.599 --> 29:48.480
You have to make up with Chen Jia Ping

29:48.480 --> 29:49.759
back to friendly times

29:49.880 --> 29:52.240
that way, you can have the opportunity to get in and out of business.

29:52.480 --> 29:55.240
Looking for information about mountains.

31:06.319 --> 31:07.119
Section Chief Chen

31:07.440 --> 31:08.880
forgot to pick up today's newspaper

31:09.400 --> 31:10.240
Thank You.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.839
Check out today's news.

31:17.319 --> 31:18.480
What news?

31:19.119 --> 31:19.960
I see.

31:21.720 --> 31:23.400
Written here,

31:23.920 --> 31:24.920
drugs all over the city

31:24.920 --> 31:25.920
also lacking

31:27.319 --> 31:28.160
do you know?

31:28.279 --> 31:30.359
That's because there are many medicinal products

31:30.359 --> 31:33.200
was forcibly bought by team leader Zhao at a cheap price

31:33.200 --> 31:33.799
Is that true?

31:34.039 --> 31:35.920
Captain Zhao can earn a lot of money again.

31:36.000 --> 31:36.960
But that money

31:36.960 --> 31:39.240
most of it would never reach his hands

31:40.240 --> 31:41.440
pull out the goose feathers

31:42.240 --> 31:43.160
also not a little.

31:43.319 --> 31:44.119
It seems like,

31:44.240 --> 31:45.200
commander of the Military Police Soldiers

31:45.200 --> 31:46.720
do what other big action?

31:51.079 --> 31:52.119
How did you know?

31:52.359 --> 31:53.799
According to my experience,

31:54.000 --> 31:55.640
stockpiling drugs on a large scale,

31:55.640 --> 31:57.240
then resell it at a high price.

31:57.519 --> 32:00.160
There must be a big action plan

32:00.160 --> 32:02.279
requires substantial financial support

32:07.079 --> 32:07.960
qian Xiu Cai

32:08.119 --> 32:09.160
quite interesting

32:09.599 --> 32:11.799
look, you are a gatekeeper.

32:11.880 --> 32:13.839
Why do you understand this so much?

32:15.359 --> 32:17.200
Just talking carelessly.

32:19.119 --> 32:20.000
That problem,

32:20.000 --> 32:22.559
is the big business of Captain Zhao and the Japanese.

32:23.720 --> 32:24.920
What about us?

32:25.799 --> 32:27.160
Lazy birds have no place to live,

32:27.160 --> 32:28.240
you can have it all yourself

32:28.839 --> 32:31.279
Chief Chen, I see you are a talented person

32:31.559 --> 32:33.079
not like playing around

32:35.519 --> 32:36.880
you are right.

32:36.880 --> 32:38.400
I don't want to live hard.

32:38.519 --> 32:39.519
But I have no other way.

32:39.519 --> 32:41.519
I must be following the wrong person.

32:41.640 --> 32:42.440
This is destiny.

32:42.559 --> 32:43.319
Jia Ping

32:49.279 --> 32:50.759
Don't eat this again

32:52.680 --> 32:53.519
I made a lot for you.

32:53.519 --> 32:54.759
I made everything myself.

32:54.960 --> 32:55.640
You see.

32:56.759 --> 32:58.119
And shrimp

32:58.359 --> 33:00.240
I've been learning from my aunt for so long

33:00.839 --> 33:01.960
you quickly taste it

33:01.960 --> 33:02.920
delicious or not?

33:03.119 --> 33:04.000
Menurutku Guoguo.

33:04.000 --> 33:04.839
This...

33:05.759 --> 33:07.400
This is not like you.

33:08.559 --> 33:09.960
Didn't I tell you,

33:11.000 --> 33:12.160
Love

33:12.160 --> 33:13.640
can change a person.

33:16.599 --> 33:17.359
You eat too.

33:17.359 --> 33:18.240
A huge amount

33:18.559 --> 33:19.799
section chief Chen

33:20.039 --> 33:21.000
Such a good wife like you

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
can still take care of the household and cook.

33:23.119 --> 33:24.279
Don't talk carelessly.

33:24.720 --> 33:25.799
We both

33:25.799 --> 33:27.000
Not married yet.

33:28.839 --> 33:29.519
Very delicious.

33:30.359 --> 33:30.799
Very delicious.

33:30.839 --> 33:31.359
Delicious, eat a lot.

33:31.359 --> 33:32.160
Section Chief Chen,

33:32.160 --> 33:33.559
you are a good girlfriend

33:33.759 --> 33:35.319
quickly take him home.

33:35.319 --> 33:36.480
Not afraid of others worrying?

33:37.519 --> 33:38.359
Who's worried?

33:38.759 --> 33:40.559
Many of us are still single.

33:40.880 --> 33:41.720
Like

33:43.359 --> 33:44.119
gao Fang

33:47.759 --> 33:49.559
I told Qian Xiu Cai you shouldn't talk carelessly

33:49.839 --> 33:50.680
gao Fang

33:50.680 --> 33:52.119
here, here Eat together.

33:52.440 --> 33:53.319
That's right, come here quickly.

33:53.319 --> 33:54.279
Try it together.

34:00.039 --> 34:01.000
You eat a little more.

34:03.880 --> 34:04.759
Eat this shrimp

34:10.760 --> 34:11.519
How

34:13.960 --> 34:14.679
very delicious.

34:15.320 --> 34:16.679
Hopefully in the future I can eat often

34:16.679 --> 34:18.159
food made by Miss Zuo.

34:18.519 --> 34:20.239
That's right, this.

34:20.239 --> 34:22.000
I hope that Miss Zuo will come often in the future,

34:22.000 --> 34:22.679
therefore,

34:22.679 --> 34:25.079
I can often eat this delicious food.

34:25.719 --> 34:26.760
Will be.

34:27.559 --> 34:28.360
Is it possible?

34:42.119 --> 34:42.719
Sis.

34:43.320 --> 34:44.840
If the two of them are really acting,

34:45.239 --> 34:47.440
her acting skills will surpass Miss Han Lu.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.920
Acting a day or two is easy.

34:57.159 --> 34:58.519
But no matter how good the acting is,

34:58.519 --> 35:00.159
if you let it continue to play a role,

35:00.400 --> 35:02.039
one day it will be found out.

35:21.519 --> 35:22.599
Menurutku Guoguo.

35:22.960 --> 35:25.039
You shouldn't come here often.

35:26.400 --> 35:27.159
Why?

35:28.960 --> 35:30.920
You don't know what place this is

35:32.519 --> 35:34.199
so I have to come often

35:36.079 --> 35:38.079
I want everyone to see it

35:38.199 --> 35:39.559
terutama Lu Fang

35:39.840 --> 35:41.320
see how sweet we are.

35:41.679 --> 35:43.159
So that they step back.

35:45.039 --> 35:45.679
Enough already.

35:46.280 --> 35:47.400
You do a good job.

35:47.400 --> 35:48.280
I go first.

35:49.800 --> 35:50.519
Liuli Guoguo.

35:50.639 --> 35:51.159
Liuli Guoguo.

36:13.760 --> 36:15.360
Your letter is here.

36:15.360 --> 36:16.440
13.00.

36:17.039 --> 36:18.400
Kafe Komanda.

36:19.199 --> 36:20.079
I'm waiting for you.

36:30.840 --> 36:32.159
I checked

36:32.159 --> 36:33.639
I've helped you investigate.

36:37.360 --> 36:38.159
Where's the list?

36:39.480 --> 36:40.159
No more.

36:41.119 --> 36:41.679
No more?

36:41.679 --> 36:42.800
So what did you find?

36:44.079 --> 36:46.440
I found something that makes you happy.

36:47.920 --> 36:48.880
Say it.

36:50.360 --> 36:50.880
Zhao Anini,

36:50.880 --> 36:53.199
Some time ago I went to Lumiere Bank.

36:53.519 --> 36:55.079
He acted too quickly

36:55.800 --> 36:57.599
However, when you want to get the list,

36:57.599 --> 36:58.679
I met a robber.

37:00.519 --> 37:01.599
He was robbed?

37:03.800 --> 37:06.239
I heard that he was also being questioned as a robber.

37:06.440 --> 37:07.639
Even beaten.

37:14.119 --> 37:15.079
Aren't you happy?

37:17.679 --> 37:19.119
This is really good news.

37:19.840 --> 37:21.199
Isn't it quite a coincidence?

37:21.199 --> 37:23.119
Why was it robbed?

37:25.920 --> 37:26.719
Komandan Luo.

37:27.280 --> 37:28.360
You said you wouldn't.

37:29.639 --> 37:32.239
No, these are not CCP people, right?

37:32.239 --> 37:32.920
enough already

37:35.760 --> 37:36.679
this problem,

37:36.920 --> 37:38.159
did not fall into Zhao An's hands.

37:38.159 --> 37:39.320
Is good news.

37:40.239 --> 37:41.800
Neither of us knew this news.

37:44.719 --> 37:46.199
Lao Luo, you are so afraid of Zhao An.

37:46.199 --> 37:47.760
This is me, I follow you every day.

37:47.760 --> 37:49.280
I don't even feel safe.

37:50.400 --> 37:51.320
What are you saying?

37:51.679 --> 37:52.480
There is no sense of security.

37:52.480 --> 37:53.320
Previous sentence

37:53.559 --> 37:54.760
afraid of Zhao An.

37:55.000 --> 37:55.960
You bastard!

37:56.079 --> 37:57.679
Really do not understand me.

38:01.639 --> 38:03.119
I will kill Zhao An.

38:30.440 --> 38:31.000
Sit down.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.079
You put the paper in your pocket

38:42.079 --> 38:43.400
This is the first date.

38:43.519 --> 38:44.559
What does it mean?

38:46.079 --> 38:47.800
I returned a letter to you.

38:47.800 --> 38:49.159
Date me once.

38:50.280 --> 38:52.360
In the future I will return a letter to you.

38:52.360 --> 38:54.000
Do you want to date me one more time?

38:56.559 --> 38:57.800
Unexpected,

38:58.840 --> 39:00.559
You stole my letter.

39:02.199 --> 39:04.000
The one who stole your letter was Da Ma Shao.

39:04.280 --> 39:05.199
However,

39:05.400 --> 39:06.639
you should be grateful

39:06.840 --> 39:08.880
these letters finally fell into my hands

39:13.559 --> 39:15.400
I wrote this letter to the Ping family

39:16.320 --> 39:17.360
we argued

39:17.960 --> 39:19.360
so I asked for the letter.

39:19.639 --> 39:21.159
If you want to see, just look.

39:22.119 --> 39:24.119
It's just that you don't think it's a business person

39:24.719 --> 39:26.800
really likes spying on other people's privacy.

39:28.119 --> 39:30.360
When I first picked up these letters

39:30.360 --> 39:31.679
just want to know

39:32.480 --> 39:34.119
Your past with Chen Jia Ping

39:34.760 --> 39:35.880
and

39:36.400 --> 39:37.880
whether you really love him or not.

39:39.400 --> 39:40.440
So

39:41.559 --> 39:42.599
do you know everything?

39:42.920 --> 39:44.360
I just know,

39:44.360 --> 39:45.599
you shouldn't love him.

39:46.320 --> 39:48.440
And he is not worthy of your love

39:49.480 --> 39:50.639
what's the deal with you?

39:51.239 --> 39:52.480
Of course it's none of my business.

39:52.920 --> 39:53.840
Except

39:54.719 --> 39:56.000
if I don't like you

39:57.000 --> 39:58.280
I've been working all day

39:59.719 --> 40:01.480
you want to snatch people

40:05.480 --> 40:07.400
chen Jiaping works for the Japanese.

40:07.880 --> 40:09.119
You're with him,

40:09.320 --> 40:10.400
sooner or later it will harm you.

40:10.719 --> 40:12.440
Don't you also work for the Japanese?

40:12.760 --> 40:14.440
I have my limits and principles,

40:15.280 --> 40:16.800
I will not do anything unconscionable.

40:19.480 --> 40:21.719
Just based on this, I won't like you.

40:22.239 --> 40:23.559
Regarding the letters,

40:24.039 --> 40:25.960
if you feel deep jealousy,

40:25.960 --> 40:27.320
just save it to read.

40:29.159 --> 40:29.840
Correct.

40:30.920 --> 40:32.119
I should be bigger than you.

40:33.039 --> 40:34.920
If you like someone,

40:35.360 --> 40:36.840
openly told him

40:37.960 --> 40:39.559
peeking into other people's privacy

40:39.960 --> 40:41.599
will disgust women

40:43.440 --> 40:45.320
These letters can prove you're lying.

40:49.920 --> 40:51.400
You probably didn't realize that, right?

40:51.760 --> 40:53.519
The bottom edge of this letter paper

40:53.519 --> 40:54.920
there is a set of numbers.

40:55.800 --> 40:57.320
I've checked at the stationery shop.

40:57.639 --> 40:58.760
This group of numbers

40:58.760 --> 41:01.320
is the factory date of this letter set.

41:02.159 --> 41:03.239
Twenty-eight

41:03.760 --> 41:04.719
one zero.

41:05.519 --> 41:06.280
Twenty one.

41:06.719 --> 41:07.880
Which means the 28th year of the Republic?

41:07.880 --> 41:09.000
Tenth month, twenty-first

41:10.159 --> 41:12.880
but the date you signed on the back of the letter is

41:13.599 --> 41:16.719
September 13th, 28th year of the Republic of China

41:18.599 --> 41:20.400
the paper is not finished yet.

41:21.079 --> 41:22.679
How the letter is written

41:26.199 --> 41:27.599
in other words,

41:28.079 --> 41:29.000
This letter

41:29.280 --> 41:31.679
is to make Luo Guanqun and Zhao An

41:31.679 --> 41:33.440
believe in your relationship.

41:34.039 --> 41:35.639
Make it quickly

41:37.159 --> 41:39.480
You and Chen Jia Ping are not a couple

41:40.000 --> 41:42.159
you guys just want to use this relationship

41:42.480 --> 41:44.519
to achieve a goal

41:46.039 --> 41:47.119
but all this is okay.

41:48.159 --> 41:49.679
Like I said earlier.

41:50.480 --> 41:53.320
This letter is in my hands,

41:54.320 --> 41:55.480
you should feel happy

41:56.159 --> 41:57.239
how should I be grateful?

42:00.280 --> 42:03.199
However I like you.

42:05.039 --> 42:06.079
I definitely...

42:06.480 --> 42:06.920
Nor hope

42:06.920 --> 42:08.119
your close relationship is real.

42:08.119 --> 42:08.599
Is your close relationship real?

42:11.920 --> 42:13.079
Thank you you like me.

42:15.559 --> 42:16.719
You're quite beautiful,

42:18.000 --> 42:19.239
also quite smart

42:20.760 --> 42:22.400
but do you think I will like you?

42:23.480 --> 42:24.639
Maybe not now

42:26.119 --> 42:27.039
but later

42:27.880 --> 42:28.840
very confident.

42:29.519 --> 42:30.360
Because every woman

42:30.360 --> 42:32.440
will love a man who can protect her.

42:32.440 --> 42:34.519
If I don't need your protection?

42:35.280 --> 42:38.599
Then I might be a little disappointed.

42:40.639 --> 42:43.599
Maybe you'll be disappointed enough to give this letter to Guanqun

42:44.400 --> 42:45.440
atau Zhao An.
