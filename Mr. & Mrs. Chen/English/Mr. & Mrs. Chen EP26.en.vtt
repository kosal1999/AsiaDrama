01:34.319 --> 01:35.480
this place

01:35.959 --> 01:37.480
I stayed longer than you

01:38.239 --> 01:39.599
I've only seen people coming in

01:40.239 --> 01:41.799
I've never seen anyone go out before

01:43.599 --> 01:44.840
Stop wishful thinking

01:45.400 --> 01:46.519
Run away with me

01:46.760 --> 01:48.200
You still have a chance

01:52.280 --> 01:53.359
I'll think about it

01:53.640 --> 01:54.879
nothing to consider

01:55.920 --> 01:57.439
If you stay here, you can only wait for death.

01:59.400 --> 02:01.200
What you said makes sense.

02:01.840 --> 02:03.439
Then I'll run out with you

02:03.879 --> 02:05.159
What good do I have?

02:08.000 --> 02:09.400
what benefits do you want

02:12.319 --> 02:13.199
Give me money

02:15.759 --> 02:16.800
I save your life

02:17.680 --> 02:18.840
I also want to give you money

02:19.199 --> 02:20.759
Of course you have to give me money

02:21.639 --> 02:23.719
I didn't need to run for the first time

02:24.080 --> 02:25.039
I know your secret now

02:25.039 --> 02:26.919
I have to run with you

02:27.560 --> 02:28.159
second

02:28.520 --> 02:29.919
You forgot the most important thing

02:29.919 --> 02:31.159
Those keys of yours

02:32.199 --> 02:32.879
not enough

02:33.400 --> 02:35.039
And the last key?

02:35.479 --> 02:36.520
you don't have that key

02:36.520 --> 02:37.520
No matter how many doors you open

02:37.520 --> 02:39.000
You can't escape either

02:40.240 --> 02:41.439
that key

02:41.800 --> 02:43.199
Nishimura is not hanging on his waist

02:43.919 --> 02:46.039
He usually keeps it with his private key.

02:47.319 --> 02:48.879
It's in his left trouser pocket

02:49.639 --> 02:52.360
Are you sure you have the ability to get the key?

02:55.759 --> 02:57.039
really uncertain

02:58.000 --> 03:00.039
Please tell me first how much money you can give me.

03:01.719 --> 03:02.800
How much do you want

03:05.680 --> 03:06.360
one thousand

03:07.120 --> 03:08.360
I don't have that much money

03:09.879 --> 03:11.599
Aren't you wasting your time here?

03:11.599 --> 03:12.319
you have no money

03:12.319 --> 03:14.120
What are you doing out there?

03:15.000 --> 03:16.199
Might as well stay here

03:16.199 --> 03:17.400
Eat together

03:18.120 --> 03:18.960
Eight hundred

03:19.400 --> 03:20.639
All my property

03:22.199 --> 03:22.960
How about it

03:26.560 --> 03:28.000
do you recognize that key

03:31.439 --> 03:32.599
The nose was cut off

03:32.879 --> 03:34.280
I don't have it, sir.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.400
I'm not that cruel

03:38.639 --> 03:39.879
He said he didn't

03:39.879 --> 03:41.199
He has it

03:41.199 --> 03:42.120
Indeed there are

03:42.120 --> 03:43.680
He has a knife in his hand

03:43.680 --> 03:45.039
Yeah

03:46.800 --> 03:47.759
sir

03:47.960 --> 03:49.199
There's something wrong with this guy's brain

03:49.520 --> 03:50.879
Do you think this is a knife?

03:50.879 --> 03:53.240
This is what I usually use to trim my nails.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.840
There's no problem with this

03:56.759 --> 03:57.560
Yes, sir

03:57.560 --> 03:58.599
You can't trust him

03:58.599 --> 03:59.280
sir

03:59.280 --> 04:01.520
You must make the decision for me, sir.

04:01.520 --> 04:02.639
you save me

04:02.639 --> 04:04.199
Is this a knife?

04:04.199 --> 04:05.560
Look

04:08.439 --> 04:10.280
The nose is still on the face

04:10.840 --> 04:12.400
Are you kidding me?

04:12.400 --> 04:14.159
do you want to die

04:14.159 --> 04:14.400
Don't, don't

04:14.400 --> 04:15.159
I'll help you

04:15.159 --> 04:16.000
sir

04:16.000 --> 04:17.480
dream dream dream

04:17.480 --> 04:18.000
that

04:18.000 --> 04:19.800
You're not talking about him

04:19.800 --> 04:21.120
Always loves to dig people’s eyes out

04:21.120 --> 04:22.319
Bite your ears?

04:22.319 --> 04:23.920
I just had a dream

04:23.920 --> 04:24.759
too real

04:24.759 --> 04:25.920
Be honest

04:25.920 --> 04:27.839
If you make trouble again, I'll kill you

04:28.319 --> 04:29.199
sir

04:29.199 --> 04:30.639
sir

04:31.959 --> 04:33.639
treat him well

04:34.360 --> 04:34.920
sir

04:35.360 --> 04:36.519
Sorry to disturb your rest

04:36.920 --> 04:37.160
sorry

04:37.160 --> 04:38.279
Get along with

04:39.759 --> 04:40.759
I don’t dare anymore. I don’t dare anymore.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.920
This key is divided into three parts

05:04.639 --> 05:05.839
length of key

05:05.839 --> 05:07.839
Equivalent to the total length of your index finger

05:08.079 --> 05:09.360
length of key body

05:09.639 --> 05:11.279
Equivalent to the first joint of the index finger

05:11.399 --> 05:12.720
and the length of the second joint

05:12.959 --> 05:14.120
There is a third part

05:14.480 --> 05:16.360
The sawtooth part is square

05:16.360 --> 05:17.360
Grooves on three sides

05:18.160 --> 05:19.000
Equilateral length

05:19.519 --> 05:21.000
One-third of your first knuckle

05:21.959 --> 05:23.920
Don’t worry, I’ve remembered everything clearly.

05:27.759 --> 05:29.199
Don't be too happy too early

05:29.279 --> 05:30.000
What's wrong

05:30.439 --> 05:31.560
material for making keys

05:31.839 --> 05:32.759
have nothing left

05:34.439 --> 05:35.000
no

05:35.240 --> 05:36.639
There are so many hinges on this bed

05:36.639 --> 05:37.879
You've used it all

05:38.720 --> 05:40.839
Do you really think that the materials I made earlier

05:40.839 --> 05:42.519
Is it a success every time?

05:42.879 --> 05:44.000
Available now

05:44.560 --> 05:45.920
It’s not that the thickness is not enough

05:46.000 --> 05:47.680
Otherwise, it will be rusty

05:48.439 --> 05:49.439
What about wood?

05:50.399 --> 05:51.480
Wood is too brittle

05:51.639 --> 05:53.040
I can't bear the exertion at all

06:12.480 --> 06:13.720
This should work

06:13.720 --> 06:14.879
Mahogany

06:14.879 --> 06:16.000
Definitely hard enough

06:16.319 --> 06:18.160
If you carve along the wood grain

06:18.720 --> 06:19.759
It shouldn't be a big problem

06:50.199 --> 06:51.439
Mr. Yamashita

06:51.439 --> 06:52.879
Then I'll go home first

06:54.160 --> 06:56.439
Since we are getting married

06:57.000 --> 06:58.839
Just don’t call me Mr. Yamashita.

07:00.360 --> 07:01.160
OK

07:03.839 --> 07:05.759
Tonight's press conference

07:05.759 --> 07:06.720
I am very satisfied

07:07.160 --> 07:08.120
Are you tired too?

07:08.800 --> 07:11.360
Go home early and rest

07:13.480 --> 07:14.160
good

07:57.040 --> 07:59.279
The copper plate of border coins is in Wang Dapu's hands

07:59.279 --> 08:00.800
He was anxious to escape

08:00.800 --> 08:03.600
The copper plate must be handed over to the military commander

08:03.600 --> 08:04.839
Just follow him

08:04.839 --> 08:06.240
You can find the copper plate

08:11.199 --> 08:12.199
It surprised me that

08:13.120 --> 08:15.480
Jiang Zhao would do such a thing

08:18.639 --> 08:19.639
I think

08:20.759 --> 08:22.360
Maybe you don't know him

08:24.040 --> 08:24.959
Do not worry

08:25.920 --> 08:27.040
I will convince him

08:30.079 --> 08:30.720
correct

08:31.800 --> 08:34.000
Did Yamashita tell you about the Sugi Project?

08:36.600 --> 08:37.320
No

08:38.480 --> 08:41.000
But Fujita, the driver at Yamashita, told me

08:41.639 --> 08:44.159
Yamashita is working for the Empire of Japan

08:44.679 --> 08:46.200
do something great

08:47.759 --> 08:48.679
how about you

08:50.080 --> 08:51.279
What are your plans for the future?

08:52.879 --> 08:54.120
I really want to marry Yamashita

08:59.639 --> 09:01.080
I've already planned it

09:36.159 --> 09:37.279
Have you brought anything?

09:46.240 --> 09:47.759
Don't worry, it's colorless and odorless

09:49.840 --> 09:50.960
Is it toxic enough?

09:51.879 --> 09:53.639
It's okay to poison a horse to death

10:17.159 --> 10:18.679
Lieutenant Commander Uchida promised me

10:18.679 --> 10:20.399
Can be alone with Mr. Jiang

10:28.279 --> 10:29.639
This skirt is still there

10:34.360 --> 10:36.200
Why do you want to frame Chen Jiaping?

10:41.399 --> 10:44.360
It turns out you came to me because of this matter.

10:47.320 --> 10:48.200
Why

10:48.399 --> 10:49.399
this is politics

10:49.679 --> 10:50.559
You do not understand

10:50.759 --> 10:52.159
I don’t understand politics

10:52.519 --> 10:53.919
But I understand someone

10:53.919 --> 10:55.960
You should have the minimum integrity and conscience

10:56.679 --> 10:57.360
anyway

10:57.360 --> 10:58.600
No one should be framed

10:58.600 --> 11:00.159
people who have helped you

11:02.919 --> 11:04.360
Zuo Shuangtao asked you to come, right?

11:05.960 --> 11:07.960
Chen Jiaping was very helpful to me.

11:10.639 --> 11:11.879
After you return to Chongqing

11:12.399 --> 11:13.639
I once couldn't think about it

11:14.039 --> 11:15.120
If it weren't for Chen Jiaping

11:15.120 --> 11:16.559
I'm already dead

11:17.000 --> 11:18.360
why didn't you tell me earlier

11:21.360 --> 11:23.879
Chen Jiaping was imprisoned in a detention center by the Japanese

11:24.720 --> 11:26.240
Only if you change your confession

11:26.759 --> 11:28.120
Only then can we save him

11:37.399 --> 11:37.960
good

11:39.279 --> 11:40.120
I promise you

11:40.919 --> 11:42.000
You need to tell Uchida

11:43.000 --> 11:45.120
The person who gave you the labor certificate is Zhao An

11:45.120 --> 11:46.720
Zhao An is the real Five of Hearts

11:49.279 --> 11:50.799
Want to put the blame on Zhao An

11:52.399 --> 11:53.960
Just relying on my confession

11:54.559 --> 11:55.840
I'm afraid it's not enough

11:56.240 --> 11:57.679
They have other plans

11:58.759 --> 12:00.080
All you have to do is say this

12:00.480 --> 12:02.200
Just think of it as the last thing you can do for me.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.080
one last thing

12:06.080 --> 12:06.919
What do you mean

12:10.639 --> 12:12.200
When are you going to see Uchida?

12:15.600 --> 12:16.519
Noon

12:17.399 --> 12:18.639
Every day at noon

12:18.639 --> 12:20.519
Uchida will return to the Military Police Headquarters

12:21.399 --> 12:22.919
Then I'll see you again in the afternoon

12:24.759 --> 12:25.679
come to me again

12:27.799 --> 12:31.080
I saw that Xinghualou’s mung bean cake is on the market again.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.360
I want to buy some and come over to eat with you

12:34.399 --> 12:35.639
Uchida

12:35.879 --> 12:38.480
Will you be allowed to come to me again and again?

12:39.879 --> 12:41.639
This is also the military police headquarters anyway.

12:42.279 --> 12:43.200
You can't escape either

12:43.720 --> 12:44.440
Isn't it?

12:49.120 --> 12:50.000
yes

12:51.240 --> 12:53.120
This is the military police headquarters

12:54.240 --> 12:55.159
Can't escape

12:58.080 --> 12:59.200
do you remember

13:00.600 --> 13:03.159
Have we taken a photo together before?

13:03.840 --> 13:06.600
You were also wearing this skirt that day

13:07.399 --> 13:08.840
the weather that day

13:10.480 --> 13:11.360
also very good

13:15.600 --> 13:16.279
Miss Hanlu

13:16.279 --> 13:17.120
What a coincidence

13:17.120 --> 13:17.919
you are here too

13:21.440 --> 13:21.919
correct

13:22.039 --> 13:23.039
congratulations

13:23.720 --> 13:24.759
What do you congratulate me on?

13:37.519 --> 13:38.399
What does this mean

13:39.480 --> 13:41.039
Haven't you seen it all?

13:42.840 --> 13:43.919
Did you promise him?

13:45.919 --> 13:48.039
When you spoke, did you answer him?

13:49.360 --> 13:51.759
Yesterday they said they were going to execute you

13:52.080 --> 13:52.679
if i don't agree

13:52.679 --> 13:54.360
Who is Shanxia?

13:56.240 --> 13:58.080
All I know is that Uchida is helping him

13:59.200 --> 14:00.519
he has great power

14:06.720 --> 14:08.360
Why didn't I think of it earlier?

14:09.279 --> 14:10.480
Yamashita Takeo

14:11.759 --> 14:14.159
He is the controller of Project Sugi

14:14.919 --> 14:16.080
he is the one

14:21.879 --> 14:22.919
what are you going to do

14:24.559 --> 14:25.919
You have already bought the mung bean cake

14:27.399 --> 14:28.879
What is this, what is this?

14:30.000 --> 14:30.159
you give me

14:30.159 --> 14:31.279
What is this, what is this?

14:31.399 --> 14:32.840
Bring it over and show it to me

14:32.840 --> 14:33.480
you give me

14:33.480 --> 14:33.679
What's this

14:33.679 --> 14:34.120
Give me

14:35.360 --> 14:36.200
Poison?

14:38.480 --> 14:40.159
Do you want to poison me to death?

14:41.039 --> 14:42.559
You want to sprinkle it on mung bean cake

14:42.559 --> 14:44.080
Let me eat it and poison me to death, right?

14:44.080 --> 14:44.759
yes

14:45.480 --> 14:46.600
I just want to poison you to death

14:46.879 --> 14:48.200
But I don't just want to poison you

14:48.200 --> 14:49.759
I want to eat mung bean cake with you

14:49.759 --> 14:51.120
I'll die with you

14:51.120 --> 14:52.000
you are crazy

14:52.320 --> 14:53.200
I'm not crazy

14:54.159 --> 14:55.960
I know very well what Yamashita Takeo's methods are.

14:56.360 --> 14:57.519
He won't let you go

14:57.879 --> 14:59.200
He won't let me go either

14:59.200 --> 15:01.879
He will use you as a weight to blackmail me.

15:01.879 --> 15:02.840
the two of us

15:03.279 --> 15:04.879
The two of us forever

15:04.879 --> 15:06.240
Don't even think about getting rid of him

15:06.240 --> 15:07.600
you are really crazy

15:08.399 --> 15:10.240
I can't die, you know?

15:10.240 --> 15:11.159
I have a mission

15:11.159 --> 15:12.480
I have to live well

15:12.480 --> 15:14.000
I can't die with you

15:15.039 --> 15:16.559
Are you still alive like this?

15:27.600 --> 15:28.759
You have to get me out

15:29.320 --> 15:30.360
I have to get out of here

15:30.960 --> 15:34.080
Takeo Yamashita is the controller of Project Sugi

15:34.639 --> 15:35.759
he loves you so much

15:36.159 --> 15:37.279
You must have a way

15:37.759 --> 15:39.120
Asked him to let me out

15:40.879 --> 15:41.799
did you mean

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
Let me really marry Yamashita

15:47.120 --> 15:48.440
to exchange for your freedom

15:48.720 --> 15:50.759
If we are still together in the future

15:51.519 --> 15:52.120
you

15:54.279 --> 15:55.679
Can you just make a little sacrifice?

15:56.039 --> 15:57.080
did you mean

15:57.840 --> 15:59.600
I want to keep Yamashita’s dirty hands off

16:00.320 --> 16:01.519
touch me again

16:02.159 --> 16:03.279
Will you taint me again?

16:03.279 --> 16:04.399
Hanlu, listen to me

16:04.399 --> 16:06.159
I don't want to hear you anymore

16:07.000 --> 16:08.600
every word you say

16:10.000 --> 16:11.360
They are all insulting me

16:13.440 --> 16:15.720
They are all insulting our love

16:16.480 --> 16:17.600
I beg you

16:18.519 --> 16:19.559
I beg you

16:19.919 --> 16:20.960
help me again

16:21.679 --> 16:23.120
How about the last time?

16:29.600 --> 16:30.679
Help you once

16:33.399 --> 16:34.600
Then who am I?

16:36.399 --> 16:37.559
After I go out

16:38.960 --> 16:39.200
I

16:39.440 --> 16:41.480
After I destroyed the Shan Project

16:42.639 --> 16:43.480
you are like me

16:44.440 --> 16:45.399
All are heroes

16:46.960 --> 16:47.960
hero

16:50.279 --> 16:52.679
Do you think I want to be a hero?

17:07.000 --> 17:08.319
Since you don't help me

17:08.480 --> 17:09.839
I just insist

17:10.160 --> 17:12.960
Chen Jiaping is the Five of Hearts

17:13.559 --> 17:15.119
You are really despicable

17:16.440 --> 17:18.240
Don’t you want to help Chen Jiaping?

17:19.880 --> 17:21.200
Don't you want to save him?

17:21.440 --> 17:22.440
OK

17:22.440 --> 17:23.480
no problem

17:23.880 --> 17:25.279
Get me out first

17:26.519 --> 17:28.200
I want to get Yamashita Takeo

17:28.200 --> 17:30.960
After hand-signed release order

17:32.279 --> 17:33.240
I immediately changed my mind

17:40.039 --> 17:41.000
do you know

17:43.039 --> 17:44.079
Yamashita Takeo

17:45.000 --> 17:47.240
He is very gentle to me on the surface

17:48.519 --> 17:51.160
But he is actually a complete pervert

17:51.759 --> 17:53.000
We are all adults

17:54.759 --> 17:55.720
I do not care

17:56.440 --> 17:58.039
You, you are shameless

18:16.240 --> 18:17.119
How long until it arrives

18:17.400 --> 18:19.119
It's going to be there in less than five minutes.

18:36.440 --> 18:37.079
parking

18:39.079 --> 18:39.880
Parking Parking

19:01.880 --> 19:03.200
What happened to Captain Zhao?

19:04.039 --> 19:04.799
fine

19:05.519 --> 19:06.640
I'll put some water in

19:06.640 --> 19:07.640
Wait for me

19:32.880 --> 19:33.480
Tom

19:33.759 --> 19:35.319
I'm going to discuss something with Trunk

19:35.319 --> 19:36.599
You go first and drive quickly

19:36.599 --> 19:37.880
Captain, it's almost too late

19:37.880 --> 19:38.519
It's almost time

19:38.519 --> 19:39.240
That's too late

19:39.240 --> 19:40.519
Let me tell the car behind me something

19:40.839 --> 19:41.519
Follow

19:41.519 --> 19:41.920
It's almost too late

19:41.920 --> 19:42.680
Follow quickly

19:43.240 --> 19:44.519
Go, go, go

19:46.400 --> 19:47.279
What happened to the captain?

19:52.559 --> 19:53.960
keep up keep up keep up

20:22.640 --> 20:23.640
Chief Uchida

20:23.640 --> 20:24.400
cotton yarn

20:45.559 --> 20:48.759
Please convey my gratitude to Mr. Yamashita for me.

20:49.119 --> 20:50.319
Mr. Yamashita said

20:50.319 --> 20:51.480
This is his first time

20:51.480 --> 20:52.640
Also the last time

20:52.640 --> 20:54.359
Let go of your enemies with your own hands

20:54.640 --> 20:57.799
Since Mr. Yamashita gives me such face,

20:59.160 --> 21:01.640
Then I will also give Mr. Yamashita a gift.

21:01.960 --> 21:02.799
what gift

21:03.359 --> 21:04.240
a truth

21:05.079 --> 21:05.799
you say

21:06.720 --> 21:08.200
In fact, Chen Jiaping

21:08.720 --> 21:09.759
Not the five of hearts

21:10.720 --> 21:12.359
I deliberately put the blame on him

21:13.319 --> 21:14.400
why did you do this

21:15.759 --> 21:17.240
because before i

21:17.599 --> 21:20.720
I heard that his relationship with Han Lu is very ambiguous.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.119
But what I didn't expect was

21:24.319 --> 21:25.880
She betrayed me

21:26.400 --> 21:27.640
It’s not Chen Jiaping

21:28.400 --> 21:29.839
But Yamashita Takeo

21:30.519 --> 21:32.720
So there is no need for me to frame Chen Jiaping

21:33.559 --> 21:35.319
You said it before

21:35.680 --> 21:37.240
Now suddenly changed his mind

21:37.240 --> 21:38.759
Do you think I would believe it?

21:39.240 --> 21:40.519
Do you believe it or not?

21:40.880 --> 21:42.440
Is it important to me?

21:44.359 --> 21:46.200
It's the cold dew that asks for something from me

21:46.599 --> 21:48.240
I just told you the truth

21:48.880 --> 21:51.960
As for whether you want to execute Chen Jiaping in the future?

21:52.359 --> 21:53.559
That's your own business

21:54.319 --> 21:56.200
If Chen Jiaping is not the Five of Hearts

21:56.640 --> 21:58.319
Who is the real Five of Hearts?

22:00.279 --> 22:01.559
and you

22:02.079 --> 22:04.359
You can only let your men

22:04.359 --> 22:06.519
Put a gun to my head again and ask

22:07.480 --> 22:08.799
Maybe I'll tell you

22:09.240 --> 22:10.000
I know

22:10.400 --> 22:12.400
Mr. Jiang is probably just pretending to be afraid of death.

22:13.759 --> 22:15.200
The information you told us

22:15.200 --> 22:16.200
seems important

22:17.000 --> 22:18.599
In fact, you have already made up your mind

22:18.599 --> 22:20.839
We can't find the recipe or the copper plate at all

22:21.240 --> 22:22.880
So it doesn't hurt to tell us, right?

22:25.839 --> 22:27.559
Who is the Five of Hearts?

22:27.559 --> 22:29.039
Such important information

22:29.039 --> 22:30.519
you won't tell us

22:30.880 --> 22:31.920
But don't worry

22:33.440 --> 22:34.680
I'll find out

22:39.200 --> 22:40.000
Mr. Jiang

22:41.279 --> 22:43.839
We did not reach a consensus in this cooperation

22:44.559 --> 22:45.559
Very sorry

22:46.359 --> 22:48.240
But if there are regrets, there are expectations

22:48.960 --> 22:50.240
We have a long way to go

22:51.039 --> 22:52.680
I'm also looking forward to it

22:53.279 --> 22:55.519
Meeting Mr. Uchida again

22:56.480 --> 22:58.599
But I will never give it to you again

22:58.599 --> 23:00.799
A chance to put a gun to my head

23:01.119 --> 23:02.039
I don't think so

23:09.240 --> 23:10.359
Where is Zhao An?

23:11.160 --> 23:12.079
I have no idea

23:22.079 --> 23:23.799
I ask you where is Zhao An?

23:23.799 --> 23:25.400
Chief Uchida, I really don’t know.

23:25.400 --> 23:27.480
Captain Zhao was always in Tom's car.

23:27.480 --> 23:28.960
I really don't know, Chief Uchida

23:29.799 --> 23:32.039
After Captain Zhao finished urinating, he asked me to leave first.

23:32.400 --> 23:34.400
Then he wanted to discuss something with Chen Shugan

23:34.400 --> 23:35.200
No

23:35.200 --> 23:36.759
Captain Zhao didn't get into my car

23:36.759 --> 23:37.599
He told us to leave quickly

23:37.599 --> 23:38.359
He got into the car behind

23:38.359 --> 23:39.440
I really do not know

23:43.119 --> 23:43.799
Chief Uchida

23:43.799 --> 23:44.799
we catch someone

23:44.799 --> 23:45.839
Let him explain the situation

23:45.839 --> 23:46.519
look

23:46.799 --> 23:47.519
bring people here

24:00.200 --> 24:00.880
Hou Si

24:01.400 --> 24:03.160
Say it again what you just told me

24:03.160 --> 24:04.880
Who is the buyer of this batch of cotton yarn?

24:05.359 --> 24:06.079
Boss Zhou

24:06.079 --> 24:07.200
Which Zhou boss

24:07.200 --> 24:09.720
It's Du Yuesheng in Chongqing

24:09.720 --> 24:11.480
That Tongti company

24:11.920 --> 24:15.240
Boss Zhou Qingsen specializes in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai areas

24:15.759 --> 24:16.480
It is said

24:16.480 --> 24:17.920
He allocated a lot of money

24:18.279 --> 24:20.079
Can get scarce supplies

24:21.400 --> 24:24.480
So the buyer is the Chongqing government

24:24.920 --> 24:26.519
I'm just an errand boy

24:26.519 --> 24:28.519
How did you know about this batch of cotton yarn?

24:29.680 --> 24:31.559
Boss Zhou told me

24:32.559 --> 24:33.519
He said over there in Shanghai

24:33.519 --> 24:35.839
Is there someone who can get the best cotton yarn?

24:35.839 --> 24:37.359
who's that person

24:37.359 --> 24:39.039
He didn't say it directly

24:39.720 --> 24:40.920
But once

24:40.920 --> 24:42.680
I heard him call that guy

24:43.160 --> 24:46.759
I heard that he seemed to be from the military command

24:47.359 --> 24:48.559
What's the code name?

24:49.119 --> 24:50.359
five of hearts

24:57.119 --> 24:58.119
Chief Uchida

24:58.720 --> 24:59.799
This is called Chen Shugan

24:59.799 --> 25:01.000
He is Zhao An’s confidant

25:08.240 --> 25:09.599
Since he is a confidant

25:11.480 --> 25:12.839
You don't know

25:12.839 --> 25:15.400
Your Captain Zhao is the Five of Hearts of the military commander, right?

25:16.039 --> 25:16.839
impossible

25:16.960 --> 25:17.839
This is absolutely impossible

25:18.039 --> 25:18.759
Chief Uchida

25:18.759 --> 25:19.960
There's no way he doesn't know

25:19.960 --> 25:21.400
I really don't know anything

25:21.400 --> 25:22.440
Chief Uchida, I really don’t know.

25:22.440 --> 25:23.480
you believe me

25:26.160 --> 25:27.039
What do you say

25:27.960 --> 25:29.359
Why doesn’t Boss Zhou come?

25:29.720 --> 25:31.319
I do not know either

25:31.359 --> 25:33.640
We agreed to meet here at five o'clock

25:35.359 --> 25:37.400
Could it be that he discovered in advance that there was an ambush here?

25:37.400 --> 25:38.599
Run away first

25:38.920 --> 25:39.880
I see

25:40.279 --> 25:41.599
I understand, Chief Uchida.

25:41.880 --> 25:43.400
Zhao An deceived us all

25:43.400 --> 25:45.039
He deliberately let us continue here

25:45.039 --> 25:46.400
Just to distract you

25:46.400 --> 25:47.799
He had time to escape

25:47.799 --> 25:49.000
Chief Uchida, this matter has nothing to do with me.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.319
I really do not know

25:52.440 --> 25:54.240
What you said seems to make sense

25:54.599 --> 25:55.599
Chief Uchida

25:55.839 --> 25:56.680
Please spare my life

25:56.680 --> 25:58.000
spare my life

25:58.000 --> 25:59.240
I will be a cow and a horse for you from now on

25:59.240 --> 26:00.440
As long as you don't kill me

26:01.559 --> 26:03.240
Then why don't I think

26:03.599 --> 26:05.160
You and Zhao An are accomplices

26:06.920 --> 26:08.400
You lead us away

26:08.400 --> 26:09.759
So that he can cover his escape.

26:10.640 --> 26:11.440
No

26:11.759 --> 26:12.519
I don't

26:13.200 --> 26:14.039
I don't

27:12.960 --> 27:14.799
Shuyun

27:15.880 --> 27:17.440
Why did you come?

27:18.400 --> 27:19.200
problem occurs

27:19.319 --> 27:20.119
What's wrong

27:20.799 --> 27:21.000
you

27:21.839 --> 27:23.599
Why are you carrying such a big box?

27:23.920 --> 27:25.759
Here are all my belongings

27:26.960 --> 27:27.920
What's the meaning

27:28.920 --> 27:30.759
The days when I followed the Japanese

27:31.079 --> 27:32.440
Completely over

27:33.039 --> 27:34.480
Thanks to my bright brain

27:34.799 --> 27:36.000
Escaped

27:36.440 --> 27:37.759
Otherwise you won't be able to see me

27:38.160 --> 27:39.359
Chen Shugan them

27:39.880 --> 27:40.839
died

27:42.079 --> 27:43.359
So what should we do now?

27:44.039 --> 27:45.359
I'll go to Pudong with you

27:45.839 --> 27:47.039
Let's hide for a while

27:47.559 --> 27:49.079
Then find a way to leave Shanghai

27:49.400 --> 27:50.839
What about after that?

27:50.839 --> 27:52.359
Will we keep escaping like this from now on?

27:52.359 --> 27:53.880
You are my only support now

27:53.880 --> 27:55.599
You can't let me live like this

27:55.599 --> 27:56.359
Shuyun

27:56.680 --> 27:57.759
Believe me

27:58.880 --> 28:01.200
There's enough money in the box to last us a lifetime

28:01.880 --> 28:03.279
I'll take you to Hong Kong

28:03.960 --> 28:05.519
let's buy a big house

28:06.079 --> 28:08.079
I'll go there to invest and do some business.

28:08.440 --> 28:10.119
Our life won't be bad

28:10.799 --> 28:11.720
By the time

28:12.119 --> 28:15.480
I will organize a grand wedding for you

28:15.759 --> 28:17.519
Then you give me a big fat boy

28:18.079 --> 28:19.240
We are a family of three

28:20.119 --> 28:21.559
No need to worry about food or clothing

28:22.839 --> 28:23.839
live a good life

28:26.279 --> 28:27.119
go to Hong Kong

28:27.119 --> 28:27.799
Hongkong

28:28.480 --> 28:29.119
Went to his

28:29.119 --> 28:31.200
Imperial Army National Army Japanese

28:31.200 --> 28:31.960
Get out

28:32.440 --> 28:34.839
I have been the grandson of the Japanese for so many years

28:34.839 --> 28:35.519
Why do I

28:35.880 --> 28:38.119
I just want to make a lot of money

28:38.279 --> 28:39.640
I live my life

28:39.880 --> 28:42.400
I let you live a good life with me

28:43.279 --> 28:43.920
Right

28:46.480 --> 28:46.799
right

28:55.039 --> 28:56.160
Shuyun

28:56.839 --> 28:58.960
You have been suffering with me during this time

28:59.799 --> 29:01.319
I'll replenish it for you later

29:03.000 --> 29:05.720
Let's go to the ferry right now

29:06.359 --> 29:07.200
Wait a moment

29:07.519 --> 29:08.039
What's wrong

29:09.480 --> 29:10.960
I still have something to get

29:11.480 --> 29:12.200
what is this

29:12.559 --> 29:14.359
Some of my gold and silver are so soft

29:14.920 --> 29:16.759
There are also some cheongsams I just made.

29:18.359 --> 29:19.160
where is it

29:20.519 --> 29:22.559
I'm hiding in the ruined temple opposite

30:10.319 --> 30:11.359
Shuyun

30:13.279 --> 30:14.359
Shuyun

30:16.559 --> 30:18.039
Come in Shuyun

30:20.200 --> 30:21.319
Shuyun

30:22.839 --> 30:23.839
come in and save me

30:24.319 --> 30:25.200
Shuyun

30:28.839 --> 30:29.680
Zhao An

30:31.519 --> 30:32.799
What are you doing with my wife?

30:33.240 --> 30:34.200
I'm here

30:34.640 --> 30:35.599
Luo Guanqun

30:36.640 --> 30:37.759
why are you here

30:38.359 --> 30:39.640
my wife is here

30:40.039 --> 30:41.680
why can't i be here

30:45.200 --> 30:46.079
Where's Shuyun?

30:46.559 --> 30:48.359
she's next to me

30:49.480 --> 30:50.319
Shuyun

30:51.880 --> 30:52.440
Shuyun

30:53.400 --> 30:54.960
Say something to Captain Zhao

30:56.319 --> 30:57.599
Don't be afraid

30:57.920 --> 30:59.759
Let the past go by

31:00.480 --> 31:02.640
You behaved very well today

31:02.839 --> 31:04.359
Luo Guanqun, your uncle

31:05.000 --> 31:06.599
You coerced Zhang Shuyun

31:06.960 --> 31:07.720
Shuyun

31:08.000 --> 31:08.599
Zhao An

31:09.559 --> 31:11.079
Stop talking nonsense here

31:11.559 --> 31:13.400
You forced me from beginning to end

31:13.400 --> 31:14.119
Shuyun

31:14.799 --> 31:16.559
I'm sincere to you

31:17.039 --> 31:20.559
Have you forgotten how Luo Guanqun beat you?

31:23.079 --> 31:24.000
Zhao An

31:25.160 --> 31:26.359
You don't believe anyone

31:26.960 --> 31:28.799
I just believe in women

31:30.960 --> 31:32.519
But it’s because of women

31:34.079 --> 31:35.000
lied to you

31:35.240 --> 31:36.519
you have to die

31:48.640 --> 31:49.640
he was angry

31:51.480 --> 31:52.160
buried him

31:53.920 --> 31:54.720
buried him

31:56.119 --> 31:57.079
Shuyun

31:58.400 --> 31:59.440
Don't listen

31:59.799 --> 32:01.839
Don't listen to Luo Guanqun lie to you

32:02.200 --> 32:03.920
You just buried me

32:04.279 --> 32:06.119
He won't let you go either

32:06.359 --> 32:07.960
Did you hear Shuyun?

32:10.440 --> 32:11.400
Shuyun

32:12.160 --> 32:14.319
Luo Guanqun, stop it

32:15.119 --> 32:16.880
I didn't bury you

32:17.200 --> 32:19.359
It was Shuyun who buried you

32:21.680 --> 32:22.559
Shuyun

32:23.240 --> 32:24.920
He is lying to you Shuyun

32:25.680 --> 32:26.480
come on

32:30.799 --> 32:31.759
Luo Guanqun

32:33.079 --> 32:34.279
Please let me go

32:34.720 --> 32:35.640
I have money

32:36.000 --> 32:37.480
I'll give you all the money

32:37.920 --> 32:38.799
I have money

32:39.200 --> 32:41.480
Look, that box is full of money.

32:41.480 --> 32:42.759
this is the key

32:42.759 --> 32:43.319
Give

32:43.799 --> 32:44.960
I throw it up

32:45.559 --> 32:47.240
Look at the money in the box

32:47.240 --> 32:48.240
for you

32:54.920 --> 32:55.680
Zhao An

32:56.480 --> 32:57.599
I'd like to see

32:57.599 --> 32:59.359
How much money have you made in the past few years?

33:07.720 --> 33:08.559
Zhao An

33:09.400 --> 33:11.680
You really didn't disappoint me

33:11.960 --> 33:13.039
Luo Guanqun will give it to you

33:13.720 --> 33:14.519
Shuyun

33:14.960 --> 33:15.640
I beg you

33:15.640 --> 33:17.200
Stop pouring dirt, Shuyun

33:17.319 --> 33:18.759
You have to save me Shuyun

33:19.319 --> 33:21.160
Shuyun, look inside the box

33:21.160 --> 33:23.279
I have a gift for you Shuyun

33:24.480 --> 33:26.039
Last time we saw it together

33:26.440 --> 33:27.920
I want to surprise you

33:27.920 --> 33:29.559
Take a look at Shuyun

33:41.640 --> 33:43.799
This is the gift Captain Zhao bought for you

33:44.440 --> 33:45.839
How do you want to deal with it

33:53.920 --> 33:54.720
Qun Ge

33:56.079 --> 33:57.160
I was wrong, Brother Qun

33:57.799 --> 33:59.920
Spare my life, Brother Qun

33:59.920 --> 34:01.599
I, Zhao An, am finished

34:01.920 --> 34:03.880
I can't stay in Shanghai any longer

34:04.359 --> 34:05.319
I go

34:05.640 --> 34:06.519
Qun Ge

34:06.920 --> 34:09.239
Spare my life, Brother Qun

34:09.239 --> 34:10.239
I was wrong

34:10.719 --> 34:12.480
I shouldn't seek your position

34:12.719 --> 34:14.280
I shouldn't steal your goods

34:15.199 --> 34:17.719
I shouldn't have any bad thoughts about Mrs. Luo

34:17.719 --> 34:18.920
I beg you

34:19.960 --> 34:21.320
Spare my life

34:21.320 --> 34:22.920
I beg you, Brother Qun

34:24.199 --> 34:25.039
Zhao An

34:25.400 --> 34:27.639
You also have today

34:30.880 --> 34:32.760
You also have today

34:33.599 --> 34:35.679
You also have today

34:41.960 --> 34:43.039
Shuyun

34:47.119 --> 34:49.280
I am sincere to you Shuyun

34:51.760 --> 34:53.480
I really want to take you away

34:55.599 --> 34:57.360
Break his spell and break the net

34:57.679 --> 34:59.840
Lift the barrier of death and disaster

35:00.679 --> 35:03.000
Save all injustice and suffering

35:03.480 --> 35:05.599
Clean, bright and more auspicious

35:09.599 --> 35:11.559
Break his spell and break the net

35:11.559 --> 35:13.760
Lift the barrier of death and disaster

35:14.119 --> 35:15.000
rescue

35:17.840 --> 35:18.559
Zhao An

35:19.000 --> 35:20.760
Huangquan Road

35:20.760 --> 35:23.199
I'll give you a ride

35:33.800 --> 35:35.920
I am sincerely Shuyun

35:37.320 --> 35:39.119
I want to live a good life with you

35:40.119 --> 35:41.639
I want to take you away

35:43.639 --> 35:45.000
buy a big house

35:46.400 --> 35:47.719
give birth

35:49.400 --> 35:51.320
I want to give you a good life

36:24.559 --> 36:25.679
All squatted

36:29.480 --> 36:30.079
Manager Luo

36:31.280 --> 36:32.280
Zhao An's men

36:32.280 --> 36:33.840
Except for those who were arrested last night

36:33.840 --> 36:35.559
All the rest is here

36:49.239 --> 36:50.679
Zhao An colluded with the military

36:51.079 --> 36:52.519
Do you know the evidence?

37:19.360 --> 37:21.079
Zhao An colluded with the military

37:21.079 --> 37:22.840
It’s not a matter of one or two days.

37:23.519 --> 37:25.280
You must know a thing or two

37:26.480 --> 37:28.760
If there is a problem, there is evidence

37:29.159 --> 37:30.559
Report everything to me

37:31.239 --> 37:33.039
If you cover up and conceal

37:33.719 --> 37:35.679
The consequences will be the same as him

37:38.199 --> 37:39.039
large spoon

37:39.400 --> 37:39.960
exist

37:40.599 --> 37:41.920
if they don't say

37:42.400 --> 37:43.639
Get my teeth punched

37:44.199 --> 37:45.400
If you don't say it again

37:47.079 --> 37:48.599
Take out your heart for me

37:49.239 --> 37:49.800
yes

37:54.400 --> 37:55.119
How about it

37:55.480 --> 37:56.960
Do you understand?

37:56.960 --> 37:58.840
Who wants to report and expose Zhao An?

37:59.480 --> 38:00.840
Now give you a chance

38:00.840 --> 38:01.519
I know

38:01.519 --> 38:02.719
I said

38:02.719 --> 38:03.079
I know too

38:03.079 --> 38:03.920
I said

38:03.920 --> 38:04.840
I also said

38:04.840 --> 38:05.760
Don't worry

38:05.760 --> 38:06.880
Come one by one

38:07.199 --> 38:07.960
You speak first

38:12.360 --> 38:13.039
Manager Luo

38:13.639 --> 38:16.800
Where do you think Captain Zhao fled to?

38:21.000 --> 38:22.199
how could I know

38:23.599 --> 38:26.400
I estimate that he is probably dead.

38:26.960 --> 38:28.079
what do you think

38:31.239 --> 38:34.679
I also accidentally heard it a few days ago

38:34.679 --> 38:37.000
Captain Zhao is in his office

38:38.039 --> 38:39.960
Planning an escape

38:41.639 --> 38:43.400
Manager Luo, don’t worry

38:43.400 --> 38:44.320
I understand

38:44.320 --> 38:46.639
See many things with your eyes

38:47.119 --> 38:48.119
Put it in the stomach

38:48.119 --> 38:50.599
But it must not leak out of your mouth

38:50.840 --> 38:51.679
Qian Xiucai

38:51.679 --> 38:53.360
I know you helped me with this matter

38:53.639 --> 38:54.519
I remember it

38:56.480 --> 38:57.920
By the way, Manager Luo

38:58.280 --> 39:00.519
Have you read the Chronicles of the Eastern Zhou Dynasties?

39:04.320 --> 39:05.599
What about Wei State?

39:05.599 --> 39:08.039
There was a janitor named Hou Ying

39:08.440 --> 39:09.559
Have a strategy in mind

39:09.559 --> 39:10.920
But hide it

39:10.920 --> 39:13.039
Until I met Mr. Xinling

39:13.039 --> 39:14.320
Only by oneself can one see the virtuous

39:14.639 --> 39:16.239
And finally became Lord Xinling

39:16.239 --> 39:18.000
Offered a plan to steal the talisman to save Zhao

39:18.000 --> 39:19.440
Protected Wei State

39:21.320 --> 39:22.840
what do you mean

39:23.199 --> 39:23.559
without

39:23.559 --> 39:24.920
nothing

39:24.920 --> 39:28.800
That is, if Manager Luo is interested, he would like to read it.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.039
Words from the Chronicles of the States of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty

39:30.039 --> 39:31.960
I can lend it to you anytime

39:32.519 --> 39:33.519
Qian Xiucai

39:34.280 --> 39:35.039
you

39:42.079 --> 39:43.400
what is your real name

39:44.639 --> 39:45.599
Qian Chengyi

39:46.000 --> 39:47.039
sun gongyi pawn

39:47.039 --> 39:49.320
The one who becomes one in the end

40:16.440 --> 40:17.360
Manager Luo

40:17.679 --> 40:18.880
I really didn't expect that

40:19.440 --> 40:21.679
Zhao An is the real Five of Hearts

40:25.119 --> 40:26.039
yes

40:26.559 --> 40:29.840
I didn’t expect that the five hearts were hidden so deeply.

40:30.800 --> 40:32.360
Zhao An fled in fear of crime

40:32.639 --> 40:34.960
This further proves our Jiaping’s innocence.

40:36.480 --> 40:39.280
Jiang Zhaoguo suddenly overturned his confession

40:39.559 --> 40:41.840
Saying that the Five of Hearts is not Chen Jiaping

40:43.159 --> 40:45.599
Do you think this is strange?

40:49.559 --> 40:51.639
What's so strange about this?

40:52.280 --> 40:53.320
Doesn't he always hold grudges?

40:53.320 --> 40:55.440
Are Jia Ping and Han Lu close?

40:55.440 --> 40:56.800
Only intentionally framed

40:57.280 --> 40:59.719
Since everyone has come to the rescue

41:00.360 --> 41:02.039
He had no choice but to tell the truth

41:03.519 --> 41:04.599
Am I right

41:07.679 --> 41:09.000
five of hearts

41:10.360 --> 41:11.280
Four of clubs

41:13.800 --> 41:16.000
You said we should go find Chief Uchida this time

41:17.840 --> 41:19.880
Can you bring Jia Ping out smoothly?

41:20.400 --> 41:22.480
The evidence is complete

41:22.599 --> 41:23.679
but

41:24.599 --> 41:26.199
It’s hard to say Japanese people

41:26.840 --> 41:28.199
Chen Jiaping

41:29.480 --> 41:31.159
It's hard to say

41:38.679 --> 41:40.159
It's been several days

41:40.159 --> 41:41.719
There is no news about Jia Ping

41:43.039 --> 41:45.400
Imprisoned in that terrible place

41:46.440 --> 41:48.840
I really don't know what will happen

42:03.440 --> 42:04.519
What book are you reading?

42:10.000 --> 42:11.599
The Japanese can't even understand a loyal traitor like you

42:11.599 --> 42:12.480
All caught

42:12.760 --> 42:14.039
So blind

42:18.960 --> 42:20.199
at the beginning

42:20.480 --> 42:22.079
I thought about climbing over the wall and getting out.

42:23.039 --> 42:24.320
But later I discovered

42:24.960 --> 42:26.119
Totally impossible

42:26.880 --> 42:28.679
Can you see the entire building clearly?

42:29.679 --> 42:31.480
The first floor is where Japanese activities take place.

42:31.800 --> 42:34.320
There is a canteen on the far right

42:34.679 --> 42:36.519
There's a back door leading outside

42:36.880 --> 42:39.719
And we have to go down to the first floor through the second floor

42:39.920 --> 42:41.239
You have to go through three iron gates first

42:41.719 --> 42:44.159
There are four more iron gates to pass behind.

42:44.159 --> 42:45.079
to escape

42:46.559 --> 42:47.960
That's the escape route

42:48.679 --> 42:49.559
Remember clearly

42:50.239 --> 42:51.960
The show starts at eight o'clock

42:52.639 --> 42:53.760
A total of eight programs

42:54.239 --> 42:55.360
If you want to escape

42:55.360 --> 42:57.519
Must escape before the show ends
