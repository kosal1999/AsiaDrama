IN SURGERY, SONG HA-YOUNG

2
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,268
Luckily, he's out of the woods for now.

3
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,562
Once we wrap up, we'll move him to the ICU

4
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,898
and monitor his recovery.

5
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:48,983
Thank you.

6
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,402
Thank you. Good work.

7
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,200
I should've taken better care of him.

8
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:58,910
It's all right.

9
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:02,038
I know he's going to wake up soon.

10
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,206
He will.

11
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,006
<i>Was I six years old then?</i>

12
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,927
I went to an amusement park
with my mother on Children's Day.

13
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,429
That was the first time I saw a dead body.

14
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,223
You were pretty young.

15
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,101
The body was in the water.

16
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:26,146
<i>When I saw her face,</i>

17
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,106
<i>she didn't scare me.</i>

18
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,774
<i>She just looked very lonely.</i>

19
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,861
<i>"She must have been terrified."</i>

20
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,530
<i>"She must've been lonely and in pain."</i>

21
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,115
<i>That's what crossed my mind.</i>

22
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,494
So I wanted to reach out to hold her hand.

23
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,374
But I couldn't do that back then.

24
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,299
Just like what you've been doing,

25
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,012
you probably did something
to help the woman back then.

26
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:12,317
<i>The Southwest Case serial killer,
Nam Ki-Tae,</i>

27
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,403
<i>said he'd kill again if he were released,</i>

28
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:16,988
<i>which shocked the public.</i>

29
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,867
We should hang men like him
in the middle of Gwanghwamun

30
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,912
and stone them to death.

31
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:27,624
Why do people want to keep him alive?
I really don't get it.

32
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,710
What he did was inhumane.
He doesn't deserve human rights.

33
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:34,297
Sir, I'm sorry,
but could you turn that off please?

34
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,049
It's giving me a headache.

35
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,551
Right. Sure.

36
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,512
This news isn't that pleasant
to listen to.

TOJUNG-DONG, ANYANG, GYEONGGI PROVINCE

38
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,654
What?

39
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,574
I'm in Tojung-dong right now.

40
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,077
I need to check out a missing person case.

41
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,872
I'll be there later.

43
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,298
-Excuse me.
-We're not open yet.

44
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,424
I see.

45
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,969
-I'm from the police.
-Hello.

46
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,023
<i>You're my lady lady</i>

47
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,025
<i>I can't live without you</i>

48
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:03,446
<i>The only thing I need in my life is you</i>

49
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,784
Are you having fun?

50
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,410
I got bored of waiting.

51
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,164
Brief me.

52
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,667
I told you over the phone.

53
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,504
So she left after singing here.

54
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,798
-And then she can't be reached.
-Right.

55
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,883
She left alone without a customer?

56
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:24,801
Right.

57
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,053
-That's it?
-Right.

58
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,889
A woman in her forties
was having fun with her customer here.

59
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:32,141
And she left before the customer,

60
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,102
and she can't be reached ever since.

61
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,478
Is that really it?

62
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,771
Right.

63
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,191
Come on.

64
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,068
Chief Park.

65
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,611
I came all the way here.

66
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,530
You should have gotten a lead.

67
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,031
I didn't ask you to come here.

68
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,158
-You came here on your own.
-Damn you.

69
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,911
You want me to report this

70
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,287
as criminal intelligence?

71
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,123
You do it. I'm out.

72
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:59,377
Another woman from a different karaoke bar
went missing in February.

73
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,671
What?

74
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,630
MISSING PERSON

75
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,006
Two cases?

76
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:06,843
Yes.

77
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,471
In February, a female worker

78
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,181
at a karaoke bar in Suwon went missing.

79
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,101
-But that case hasn't been filed yet.
-Why not?

80
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:18,438
A lot of these workers often go AWOL
and move to another karaoke bar.

81
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,480
I guess that's why.

82
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,567
But how did you come across this case?
This wasn't filed.

83
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,068
When I was on this case,

84
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,446
my friend who worked
at a karaoke bar in Suwon said

85
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:31,409
a worker there
went missing out of the blue like this.

86
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,582
What's your take on this?

87
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,209
What I think doesn't matter.

88
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,545
I'm just a cop.

89
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,297
I investigate when I get the order.

90
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,840
And I don't when there's none.

91
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,592
You're a detective. You have no hunches?

92
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,553
Show me that you're at least trying
to open this case.

93
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,139
There was a time

94
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,724
when I had to pay a hefty price

95
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,309
because of my hunches.

96
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,729
So I'm careful with everything.

97
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,064
-Okay. You can leave now.
-Okay.

98
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,359
SUPERINTENDENT HEO GIL-PYO

99
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,488
Well, both of the missing women

100
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,448
were in the same line of work.

101
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,074
I couldn't find any connections

102
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,784
other than their profession.

103
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,369
Thenâ€¦

104
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,956
is it possible that
there was no motive behind these cases?

105
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,750
Is that your hunch?

106
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,669
Well, every detective has a hunch.

107
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,464
Go.

108
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,893
This way.

109
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:41,604
Hello.

00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,274
SHIN MI-JUNG'S HOUSE

112
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,988
You guys still haven't found her?

113
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,242
Maybe something really happened to her

114
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,118
if even you guys can't find her.

115
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,662
That's not necessarily true.

116
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,247
We're here to check a few things.

117
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,414
Why come here twice

118
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,624
if this wasn't serious?

119
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,919
Did she pay rent monthly?

120
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,546
She paid me monthly.

121
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,927
If you couldn't reach her since February,

122
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,346
she must be behind on rent
for three months.

123
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,307
Yes. But I can just deduct her rent

124
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,810
from the initial deposit she made.

125
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,687
I just hope she's okay.

126
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,356
So no one came after our visit?

127
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,524
Hey.

128
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,442
Gosh.

129
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,278
She's been my tenant

130
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,654
for the past three years.

131
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,947
And I haven't seen her

132
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,407
bringing people here.

133
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,034
She even stayed here during the holidays.

Please call Song Ha-young.

140
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:10,735
Inspector Song?

141
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,529
I read the article and heard stories.

142
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,449
He has a knack for identifying
connections between cases.

143
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:19,952
Hey.

144
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,997
You really don't think
it's a missing person's case?

145
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,709
Well, we have no concrete proof yet,

146
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,253
but my hunch says otherwise.

147
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:34,008
If that's your hunch, it's probably right.

148
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,810
Mr. Heo, to what do I owe
the pleasure of this call?

149
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,687
<i>Hey, how have you been?</i>

150
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,731
It took you this long to think of me?

151
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,524
I just faxed something over to you.

152
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,027
<i>It's a missing person's case.
Can you look into it?</i>

153
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,279
Of course,
you wouldn't call me for no reason.

154
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,740
A missing karaoke bar employee?
Is this the case?

155
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,076
No. We did receive a report for that one.

156
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,119
Apparently, there's an unreported case.

157
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,412
"Apparently"?

158
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,708
The person has no family or friends,
and no one can reach her.

159
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:08,793
What about this case?

160
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,628
Both missing women

161
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,547
worked at karaoke bars.

162
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,967
<i>When the Special Crime Squad
was all lost, you guys said</i>

163
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,678
<i>cases with more than
two common things may be connected.</i>

164
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:23,682
These could be like the motiveless crimes
you mentioned.

165
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,434
Can you go check with Inspector Song?

166
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,477
Ha-young can't go.

167
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,896
This is how you treat me now?

168
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,232
You're hurting my feelings here.

169
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,358
I'll go and check.

170
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:36,362
Right, everyone says
your team is in high demand now.

171
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,572
I'll look into it and call you back.

172
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,366
Okay.

173
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,495
Was that Superintendent Heo
at Gyeonggi Police Agency?

174
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:45,704
Yes.

175
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,999
I guess he hasn't heard
about Inspector Song yet.

176
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,543
He's at Gyeonggi Agency now,

177
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,753
so he wouldn't know
unless he looked into it.

178
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,340
This is a missing person's case.

179
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,385
Let's check the area, her movements,
and the time of the incident.

180
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:00,678
Yes, sir.

181
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:12,898
You're doing great.

182
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,901
Let's try that one more time.

183
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,661
<i>Neuroparalysis?</i>

184
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:28,330
When the fractures occurred
at the time of the accident,

185
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,292
some of the nerves around the bones
were damaged.

186
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,211
Thankfully, he can move his toes a little,

187
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:37,423
and there isn't a complete
loss of sensation,

188
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:40,301
so I'd say it's partial paralysis.

189
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,760
<i>In cases like this,</i>

190
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,889
<i>he could recover
through rehabilitative therapy.</i>

191
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,349
<i>The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency</i>

192
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,810
<i>transferred gang members who had been</i>

193
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,979
<i>embezzling cash through an illegal casino</i>

194
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,106
<i>to the prosecution.</i>

195
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,901
We wrapped up another case.

196
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,360
Good work, everyone.

197
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,695
How about a team dinner?

198
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:02,239
You want to drink, don't you?
Sit down already.

199
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,824
The case isn't closed

200
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,493
until the trial is over.

201
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,120
I told them to contact us
if they need more evidence.

202
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,413
Okay.

203
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,708
<i>The gift certificates they received
were usedâ€¦</i>

204
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:16,295
Right. Shouldn't we visit Inspector Song
in the hospital?

205
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:19,798
We haven't seen him
since he moved to the general ward, right?

206
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:20,925
That's right.

207
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:26,472
GYEONGGI PROVINCIAL POLICE AGENCY

208
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,897
Look at you.

209
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,442
Salute, Superintendent Heo Gil-pyo.

210
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,695
Did you really come alone?

211
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,073
Why? Am I not good enough?

212
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,700
I trained Korea's first criminal profiler.

213
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:47,743
I'm in high demand.

214
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,662
Goodness. Don't be so difficult.

215
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,580
This is so cool.

216
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,125
Oh, there he is.

217
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,877
This is Chief Park
of the Serious Crime Unit.

218
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,379
You know him, right?

219
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,464
-Yes, we've met.
-It's been a while.

220
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,840
Take a seat.

221
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,720
Are you in charge of this case?

222
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,181
No, Anyang Police Station is in charge,

223
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,267
but it's a little strange.

224
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,645
As for the unreported case in Suwon,
she has no family.

225
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,106
That's right.
That was probably why no one reported.

226
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,026
What's going on?

227
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,903
Don't tell meâ€¦

228
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:24,572
No, right?

229
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,324
Hey, I'm still new here.

230
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,326
Isn't that why you got in touch with me?

231
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,996
I'll go check the scene first.

232
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,497
I'll go with you.

233
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,173
Slowly.

234
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,142
Inspector Song.

235
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,228
You came again.

236
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,814
Yes. Here, it's just something small.

237
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,983
My gosh, you always bring something.

238
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,443
Where can I put this?

239
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:03,861
You can put it over there.

240
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:07,489
I'll leave you to talk. Since you're here,

241
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,116
I should step out for lunch.

242
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,785
You didn't have to come all the way here.

243
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,164
I heard
you were undergoing rehabilitation.

244
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,499
How are you feeling?

245
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,251
Not bad.

246
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,462
Make yourselves at home.

247
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,213
I'll leave you to talk.

248
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,758
Please stay. We'll leave soon.

249
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,594
You'll feel more comfortable without me.

250
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:31,055
No, ma'am. That's not why we're here.

251
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,222
Yes, just stay.

252
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,893
I want to step out for lunch.

253
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:39,897
-All right, then.
-Enjoy your lunch.

254
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,231
Thank you.

255
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,485
Oh, let me.

256
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,700
I can do it by myself. Thank you.

257
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,914
You're doing much better now.

258
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,667
Oh, we came to see you
when you were in the ICU.

259
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,211
That was when Captain Yoon and I
met your mother.

260
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,672
Get better soon,

261
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,341
so we can work together again.

262
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:11,387
Yes, you're in high demand at the moment.

263
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,475
The Behavioral Analysis Team
was already very busy,

264
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,728
but Chief Kook takes care of everything
by himself now,

265
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,772
so he's always swamped these days.

266
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,525
But you're almost fully recovered now.

267
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,777
You should be able
to return to work very soon.

268
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,572
I don't intend on going back.

269
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,964
As you can see, it's a quiet area.

270
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,594
Most customers of this karaoke bar
are people who live in the area.

271
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,430
I don't see any security cameras.

272
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,472
That's right.

273
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:59,810
The local precinct already questioned
every customer who visited that day

274
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,228
but found nothing.

275
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,855
But her phoneâ€¦

276
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,065
On the map, you'll see Daejong Lake.

277
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,692
TOJUNG-DONG

278
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,277
DAEJONG LAKE

279
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,654
Daejong Lake? It's like a recreation area.

280
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,115
It's estimated
she went missing at around 1 a.m.,

281
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,950
so she didn't go there to hang out.

282
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,910
Nothing was caught on the security camera.

283
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,412
Any possibility of suicide?

284
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,998
The divers already searched
the entire lake

285
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,082
but found nothing.

286
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,459
She didn't commit suicide.

287
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,836
And the thing is,

288
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,047
the person she last spoke to

289
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,173
was her daughter.

290
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,968
She told her she'd pick up
fried chicken and head home.

291
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,473
You wouldn't be able to hail a taxi here.

292
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,518
She probably took a bus at that stop.

293
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,312
Oh, right.

294
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,398
We already looked into it
and even interviewed the driver

295
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,276
who drove the last bus that night,

296
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,445
and she wasn't on the bus.

297
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,740
And the location
where her phone last pinged

298
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,784
is far from the bus route.

299
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,914
Then how did she get there?

300
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,999
She must've walked orâ€¦

301
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,169
Perhaps abducted?

302
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,804
-Hello.
-I guess it's your day off.

303
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,807
-Yes. Your soybean paste stew was so good.
-I see.

304
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,392
-Really? I'll make it again.
-Thank you. Goodbye.

305
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,727
Have a good day.

306
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,559
{\an8}MISSING PERSON

307
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,145
Her family must be so worried.

308
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,729
MISSING PERSON, PLEASE FIND MY MOTHER

309
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,315
Song Ha-young is doing well, right?

310
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:15,612
I've been meaning to get in touch,
but I've been too busy.

311
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,365
I thought he'd come with you.

312
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,450
Ha-young isâ€¦

313
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,828
Did he not want to come because of me?

314
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,290
-You know how he is, right?
-I sure do.

315
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,209
He doesn't hold grudges.

316
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,378
He probably doesn't care what I'm up to.

317
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:35,382
If you're curious,
you could reach out to him first.

318
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,218
Right. I'm sure I'll see him soon anyway.

319
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,053
Time will fly by.

320
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,556
And you may never get a chance.

321
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,350
Sorry?

322
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,979
Let's head over to Daejong Lake.

323
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,408
<i>Nam Ki-Tae, the suspect
in the Southwest Serial Murder Case,</i>

324
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:04,661
<i>showed no remorse for his actions
during his first trial last month.</i>

325
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,997
<i>His attitude enraged
the bereaved families andâ€¦</i>

326
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,415
<i>Why would I feel remorse?</i>

327
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,876
<i>I'm not sorry at all.
I don't even feel guilty.</i>

328
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,268
<i>I'm so sorry, Hwa-yeon.</i>

329
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,855
I'm sorry, Hwa-yeon.

330
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,120
At that intersection up ahead,

331
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:52,459
the road splits up
into the victim's home and Daejong Lake.

332
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:56,004
If you turn left and find Daejong Lake.

333
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:09,268
If she wanted to go home,
she should've taken a right.

334
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:12,312
The location of the phone
the missing person pinged

335
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,147
right there on the left

336
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,358
and turned off as she went for the lake.

337
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,402
Let's say she was abducted.

338
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:22,030
If she was forced to get in his car,
he would've taken her phone first.

339
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,408
But the phone of an abducted woman was

340
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,909
turned on until she got here.

341
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,579
The last person she talked to
was her daughter.

342
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,833
After she left the karaoke bar,
she didn't make any calls.

343
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,710
Maybe she volunteered to hop in.

344
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,586
Not unless she knew him.

345
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,213
She wouldn't get into a random car.

346
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,173
Did you question her associates?

347
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,342
Yes.

348
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:48,307
DAEJONG LAKE

349
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,685
GUKIL HOSPITAL

350
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:39,024
They came and visited you twice

351
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,692
even when you were in the ICU.

352
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,112
You didn't know?

353
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,907
A few more visited you other than them.

354
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,075
You weren't aware?

355
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,576
Not just Chief Young-soo?

356
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:52,454
Chief Young-soo stops by very often.

357
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,457
Some younger people came too.

358
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,542
A woman and a man.

359
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,002
I see.

360
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,838
And there were other people
from the Seoul Agency,

361
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,799
someone on the older side.

362
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,008
Then other people

363
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:08,011
who said they're your colleagues
lined up to visit you,

364
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,055
even after you were moved here
and bedbound.

365
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,682
Even as you were in bed,

366
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,769
all of your colleagues flooded in
and visited you,

367
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:18,396
so I was really glad.

368
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,816
You didn't know
if your son was going to wake up,

369
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,983
but you were glad?

370
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,152
Why wouldn't I know that?

371
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,530
I knew you would wake up.

372
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,782
How? Even the doctor didn't.

373
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,700
I'm your mom.

374
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,999
GUKIL HOSPITAL

375
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,672
Ha-young is asleep, right?

376
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,966
Yes, he fell asleep half an hour ago.

377
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,676
I see. How was he today?

378
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,220
His rehab is going well,

379
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,806
and he's recovering quickly too.

380
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:57,060
Right, Captain Yoon and Detective Nam
stopped by this afternoon.

381
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,104
Goodness, he must've felt awkward.

382
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:01,773
Only on the outside.
He's not like that on the inside.

383
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:05,610
It's not like I've known him
only for a couple of days.

384
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,487
I can tell by his face.

385
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:13,118
Chief Young-soo, you should see
Ha-young before you leave.

386
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,954
I still can't muster up the courage.

387
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,124
Goodness.

388
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:31,428
MANYEON-DONG, GUNPO, GYEONGGI PROVINCE

389
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:42,355
Excuse me, may I ask you a question?

390
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,824
Oh, I'm not dangerous.

391
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:56,077
I wanted to ask you for directions.

392
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,329
Sure.

393
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:01,082
I'm trying to go to Taepyeong Park.
Which way do I need to go?

394
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,377
It's probably closed right now.

395
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,338
Oh, I'm not trying to go there.

396
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,089
I'm going in that direction.

397
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:09,633
I see.

398
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:15,889
You can go down this way
for about 900 meters.

399
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,808
When you see a big barbecue place
on the right, take a right.

400
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,519
Turn right at the barbecue place.

401
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,314
-Yes. And thenâ€¦
-One second.

402
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:25,732
I have a bad memory,

403
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,317
so let me write it down.

404
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,443
Hold on.

405
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,950
I don't have paper or a pen.

406
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:37,869
It's not that confusing.

407
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,289
Turn right at the barbecue place,
then the second--

408
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,249
Where are you headed?

409
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,417
Me?

410
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:47,254
If you don't mind, I can give you a ride.

411
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,131
The bus will be here soon. It's all right.

412
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,926
I'm driving down anyway.

413
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:55,178
If you're going in the same direction,
I'll give you a ride.

414
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,763
No, I'm fine.

415
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,224
I'm not dangerous, you know.

416
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,143
That's not why.

417
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,813
The bus stops near my house,

418
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,439
so I'm really fine.

419
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:09,943
Well, the world is now a dangerous place,

420
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,653
so it's not easy to hop in, right?

421
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:13,822
No.

422
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,699
When will the bus get here?

423
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,118
Is it the last bus?

424
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,744
It's about time it came.

425
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,204
Did you miss the last one?

426
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,208
Then I can wait with you.

427
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,543
If you missed the last bus,

428
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:27,919
I can give you a ride.

429
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,130
No, I'm really fine.

430
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:33,174
No, I'll leave
after I see you get on the bus.

431
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,525
The last bus left, right?

432
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,237
It's pretty late,

433
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,906
so I have to get going too.

434
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,950
You really won't get in?

435
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,118
Will you be okay?

436
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:01,911
I'll go, then.

437
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,752
Then can you just tell me
the directions once again?

438
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,215
Go down this way, then at the barbecueâ€¦

439
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,550
Why don't you just get in?

440
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:17,927
Why are you so anxious?

441
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,680
Goodness, it must be cold.

442
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,599
Hop in.

443
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,104
In that case, thank you.

444
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:33,860
The bus is here. I'll take that.

445
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,654
Take a left at the second intersection.

446
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,539
Damn it.

447
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,341
Damn it!

448
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:04,682
That bus.

449
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,814
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

450
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:15,026
Can you check if there are
any similar cases in the Gyeonggi area?

451
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,529
Yes.

452
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:23,451
The first one wasn't even reported.

453
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,371
We can only speculate
instead of investigating it.

454
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,749
It's tough to be the judge
just with that case.

455
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:33,169
Anyway, continue to check
if there are any similar cases.

456
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:37,590
Okay.

457
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:41,302
-Captain Yoon.
-Thank you.

458
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,595
You're here.

459
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:43,930
-Thank you.
-Chief.

460
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,140
-Is that for me?
-Yes.

461
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,266
-Thank you.
-Sure.

462
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:51,771
It feels like I'm on a break
drinking coffee away from

463
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,107
the Wide-Area Investigation office.

464
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:58,236
Coffee is about the only thing
that can comfort people like us.

465
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,529
Soâ€¦

466
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,407
is the Analysis Team working on a case?

467
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,325
Oh, it's Gil-pyo.

468
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,618
Superintendent Heo?

469
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,997
Well, it's a missing case
of karaoke bar employees.

470
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,667
He said there was one each
in February and April.

471
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,086
He wanted our opinion,
so I went to Gyeonggi Agency yesterday.

472
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,921
Did you go alone?

473
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,007
Yes, it's not even that far.

474
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:22,135
But what do you mean the first case

475
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:24,137
was not reported?

476
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,890
I overheard you on the phone.

477
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,601
While they investigated
the missing case from April,

478
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,770
they found an unreported missing case,

479
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,272
because she lived alone
without any family.

480
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,649
I see.

481
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:39,527
Right, so what brings you here?

482
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:46,868
Detective Nam and I went
to visit Inspector Song yesterday.

483
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:49,621
I heard.

484
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,707
He seemed very exhausted.

485
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:55,960
I thinkâ€¦

486
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:58,922
he needs some time to himself.

487
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:01,674
RESIGNATION LETTER

488
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,676
I don't want to go back.

489
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,181
I see.

490
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,017
Don't think about anything else,

491
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:15,396
and just focus on your health
while you stay in the hospital.

492
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,898
I'm spending

493
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,692
a lot more time with my mother

494
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,236
since I was hospitalized.

495
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,613
We're having meals together.

496
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,492
And we're talking a lot more.

497
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:34,499
I can't even remember the last time
I had a normal day like this.

498
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:41,005
I realized that having a normal life
like this was the joy of life.

499
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:47,971
I've been dealing with only evil,
intelligent criminals.

500
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,391
I guess I was fed up with them.

501
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,311
-Captain Kook.
-Yes.

502
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,649
Do you think
I was only trying to put myself

503
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,526
in their shoes?

504
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,322
To be honest, what scared me the most

505
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,533
was the anxiety

506
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:13,204
that there might be a different side of me
I was not aware of.

507
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,333
I was scared

508
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:21,045
that even I might turn into them.

509
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,800
For now,

510
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,928
don't let these thoughts get to you. Okay?

511
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,806
Just look after yourself and rest.

512
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,057
I'll get going.

513
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,812
And I will hold on to this for now.

514
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,314
Captain Kook.

515
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:45,028
I don't want to go back.

516
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,616
-Chief Kook.
-Yes.

517
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:53,703
I'm here to talk about that.

518
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,833
It's fine. Woo-ju knows everything.

519
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,044
Okay.

520
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,798
You watched the interview. So you know

521
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:09,052
that they're beyond our imagination.

522
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,930
Those monsters dump out

523
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,766
a different kind of trash
from the interrogation.

524
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,185
And handling this trash

525
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,437
isn't easy.

526
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,730
Right.

527
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,609
And that probably exploded.

528
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,779
He needs time to empty it out too.

529
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,158
Time to empty it outâ€¦

530
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,911
You need to take it easy too,
Captain Yoon.

531
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,580
When people keep running without a break,

532
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,999
they always trip over and explode.

533
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:42,919
Soâ€¦

534
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,924
what do you plan to do
about Inspector Song?

535
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:49,634
I need to wait.

536
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,805
After everything he's been through,

537
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,932
I couldn't push him again

538
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,143
because I felt responsible

539
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,230
for his current state.

You're not going to sing?

543
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,750
No. Let's just talk.

544
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:24,919
It's a waste of money.

545
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,170
Why don't you sing a song?

546
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,548
I would rather talk to you

547
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:31,092
than sing a song.

548
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,470
Sure. I'll turn off the music.

549
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,729
Shall we go for another round?

550
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,456
-What are you doing?
-It's fine. Don't be like that.

551
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,249
Stop it.

552
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,625
Get your hands off me.

553
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:05,960
Stop it!

554
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,211
Damn it!

555
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,047
What the hell are you doing?

556
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,425
Hey.

557
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,595
Open up. Unlock the door!

558
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,347
Hey.

559
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:22,810
You!

560
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:29,067
You're ruining my good mood.

Excuse me.

564
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:11,275
This is
Detective Song Ha-young's room, right?

565
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,654
Yes, it is. Why do you ask?

566
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:17,448
Could you give this to Detective Song?

567
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:19,575
Sure.

Hey, Ha-young.

570
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:35,967
I think she works here as a volunteer.

571
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,719
But she told me
to give this to you and left.

572
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,138
A volunteer?

573
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,265
Yes. Open it.
I'm curious to see what it is.

574
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,937
Goodness. What's all this?

575
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,523
She must be an excellent cook.

576
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:53,151
Goodness. There's a card too.

577
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,360
-Here.
-Right.

578
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:57,071
Goodness. I can't believe this.

579
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:01,802
<i>SOS. I can't handle
Chief Kook's jokes by myself.</i>

580
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,888

581
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:05,765
<i>How's the rehab going?</i>

582
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:08,851
<i>I'm sorry for not visiting you often.</i>

583
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,562
<i>Inspector Song, it's winter now.</i>

584
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,481
<i>It's gotten cold.</i>

585
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,525
<i>Don't catch a cold,
and take care of yourself.</i>

Sir, I want to touch that!

593
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,683
Which one? That one?

594
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,226
That one over there.

595
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,103
Come here.

596
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,981
How pretty.

597
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,692
Is that all?

598
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:42,361
-No. I want to touch this too!
-This one?

599
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,581

-Yes.

602

Yes, thanks to you.

603
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,637
That's good to hear.

604
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,390
Thank you for the food.

605
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,309
I really enjoyed it.

606
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,561
I should've thanked you sooner.

607
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,813
It was long ago,

608
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,608
so I didn't think you'd remember me

609
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,819
since you work on so many cases.

610
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:25,613
I remember everything.

611
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,449
I remember Ms. Choi Hwa-yeonâ€¦

612
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,328
and you too.

613
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:39,627
It's just that

614
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,173
I didn't have the courage.

615
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:46,967
To faceâ€¦

616
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:48,928
the victims

617
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,181
or their families again.

618
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:55,643
I felt the same way.

619
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:04,110
When I think about the scumbag
who did that to Hwa-yeon,

620
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,946
I still want him to suffer the same.

621
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,991
Whenever I'm reminded that
he's doing just fine in jail,

622
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,576
I feel so resentful.

623
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,663
I just want to follow Hwa-yeon
and die too.

624
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:22,002
My life has been so miserable.

625
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:26,590
To tell you the truth,
I couldn't bring myself

626
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,385
to say hello to you
when I first saw you here

627
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:32,680
because all the horrible memories
came rushing back.

628
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,684
I had nightmares for days.

629
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:40,896
I thought maybe I should stop

630
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,481
volunteering here.

631
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:45,985
I'm sorry.

632
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,821
Why are you sorry?

633
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,116
I should thank you if anything.

634
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,546
That's why I still had the handkerchief.

635
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,675
One day, I saw it again

636
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,052
and realized

637
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,682
that I had been able to hold out

638
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,393
thanks to everyone

639
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,979
who did their best for me and Hwa-yeon.

640
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:28,027
And you're one of them.

641
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:32,823
Hold on a moment.

642
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,409
-Where are you going?
-I'll be right back.

643
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,827
Just a moment.

644
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,834
I ran into you,
so I couldn't prepare anything

645
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,003
Here, take this and eat it.

646
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,296
No, it's okay.

647
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:49,298
I bought it just now, so it's still warm.

648
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:50,716
Then let's eat it together.

649
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,551
This is for your recovery

650
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,261
and a small token of my gratitude.

651
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,517
I read the newspaper articles.

652
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,186
Just like back then,

653
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:05,356
you only think about
the victims and their families.

654
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,442
<i>-Thank you very much.
-No problem.</i>

655
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:12,321
<i>Some of the bereaved manage
to pluck up the courage to live on,</i>

656
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:16,617
<i>but I'm sure some are
still drowning in sorrow.</i>

657
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,414
Please help people like us,

658
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,376
so no one else

659
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:28,671
has to lose their loved ones like that.

660
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:14,550
<i>Joy to the world, the Lord has come</i>

661
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,629
-Inspector Song!
-Hey.

662
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,716
-You woke him up.
-I'm sorry.

663
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,678
It's okay. I had to get up anyway.

664
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:02,181
-When did you get here?
-Just now.

665
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:03,682
Here, this is for you.

666
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:05,893
I picked out the best ones.

667
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:06,935
Thank you.

668
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,230
When will Chief Kook get here?

669
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,649
I thought he was coming with you.

670
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,026
He'll be here later.

671
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,487
-Have some.
-Thank you.

672
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:19,698
-You too, Reporter Choi.
-Thank you.

673
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,158
You can go home soon, right?

674
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:23,494
Yes, in two days.

675
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:25,037
After almost six months.

676
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,289
-How do you feel?
-Is this an interview?

677
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:28,957
Come up with better questions.

678
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,834
Of course, he's excited.

679
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:33,212
Then what will you do
as soon as you get home?

680
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,130
I'm not sure.

681
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,217
I haven't really thought about it.

682
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:49,019
Wait, hold on!

683
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:03,200
Let's go eat something.

684
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:04,368
You want to eat again?

685
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:05,577
You didn't have dinner?

686
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,663
I did, but I'm hungry again.

687
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,873
-It's winter, you know.
-She eats a lot.

688
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:12,793
-It's good to eat a lot.
-Oh, Chief Kook.

689
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,629
-You made it.
-We waited for you until now.

690
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:17,840
-I see. You're leaving now?
-Yes, we are.

691
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:19,758
You're here.

692
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:21,802
Hey.

693
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:22,970
Get in, guys.

694
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:27,224
I guess these guys kept you up.
You should be in bed now.

695
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,393
You just got here.
Are you leaving right away?

696
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:31,770
Yes. I mean, no.

697
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:38,569
Actually, I should get going.
You need to go to bed.

698
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:41,238
I'm glad to see you looking healthy.
I'll be off, then.

699
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:42,489
Bye.

700
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,242
-See you in the office.
-Okay, good night.

701
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,461
What did Ha-young say just now?

702
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:56,879
"See you in the office."

703
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:09,808
What is it?

704
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,239
Excuse me, did you miss the bus just now?

705
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:26,700
-Pardon?
-It's cold.

706
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:28,368
I can give you a ride.

707
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:32,080
I'm following the bus route anyway,

708
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:36,001
so I can drop you off along the way.

709
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,886
-This looks so good.
-It looks amazing.

710
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,266
Eat it with green onions. It's so good.

711
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:56,355
Inspector Song

712
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:58,815
looked more high-spirited
than ever before.

713
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:01,902
I'm sure he's relieved
that he can finally go home.

714
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,529
It must've been tough.

715
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,908
Oh, Detective Nam.

716
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,660
What are you doing here?

717
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:13,997
We met at Mapo Police Station
and in front of Seoul HQ as well.

718
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,707
You remember me, right?

719
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,918
I'm Reporter Choi Yoon-ji from Fact Today.

720
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:20,796
That's right, Reporter Choi Yoon-ji.

721
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:22,506
I'm Nam Il-young,
Wide-Area Investigation Squad.

722
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:25,509
-Good to see you.
-You're always so quick.

723
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:27,970
-Are you here alone?
-I stopped by on my way home.

724
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,138
I'm picking up my late-night snack.

725
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:31,932
-Let's sit down.
-Okay.

726
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,893
-We were going to order some drinks.
-I see.

727
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:37,688
Excuse me, could we get two more servings?

728
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:38,605
My goodness.

729
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,275
I don't want to be a third wheel.

730
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,443
Gosh, no. We're just friends.

731
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,780
-Don't even worry about it.
-Oh, really?

732
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:48,782
You sure know
how to enjoy beef intestines.

733
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:01,295
BUS STOP
GEUMCHAN VILLAGE

734
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,133
Thank you.

735
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:10,470
Were you out with your friends?

736
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,681
Yes.

737
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,101
I couldn't just pass by,
looking at you freezing.

738
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:17,060
Thank you.

739
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,937
You can just drop me off along the way.

740
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:21,523
It'll probably start snowing soon.

741
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:23,442
We should help each other out, you know?

742
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:28,447
Who knows? Santa Claus may give us a gift.

743
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,240
That's true.

744
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,826
You deserve
a nice Christmas gift for this.

745
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:36,246
Then how about you give me a gift?

746
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,042
Sorry?

747
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,211
I want a gift.

748
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:06,860
Hey.

749
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:10,280
I had fun thanks to you.

750
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,623
{\an8}CHIEF PARK DAE-WOONG

751
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:20,666
Hello?

752
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,253
Okay.

753
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:32,344
Superintendent Heo.

754
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:35,764
Another girl has gone missing
in Tojung-dong.

755
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:39,768
-Again?
-I think it's the same guy.

756
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,022
Give Young-soo a call too.

757
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:46,233
FEMALE COLLEGE STUDENT GOES MISSING
IN GYEONGGI PROVINCE BEFORE CHRISTMAS

758
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:48,652
-Chief.
-Yes?

759
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:51,488
We received a missing person's report
from Tojung-dong, right?

760
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:52,781
Yes. Why do you ask?

761
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,328
Yes, Chief Park?

762
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:02,290
Okay. I got it.
I'm going to Gyeonggi Agency.

763
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:03,709
Okay, I'll see you later.

764
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,253
Yes, I'll head over right now.

765
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,588
-Here's your receipt.
-Oh, yes.

766
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,257
Thank you.

767
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:16,304
I'll get a taxi for you. Go home first.

768
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,807
Don't do that, I can take the bus.

769
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,350
Taxis are more comfortable.

770
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:22,644
All right, then. Thank you.

771
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,646
Take it easy, okay?

772
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,022
Yes, don't worry.

773
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:28,859
I'm so glad you're getting discharged.

774
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:31,027
I won't scare you like that again.
I'm sorry.

775
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,654
-Let me carry that.
-It's fine.

776
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,322
-I got it.
-You're so stubborn.

777
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:36,324
-I told you to take it easy.
-Let's go.

SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

779
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,334
Inspector.

780
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:49,880
-Are you feeling better?
-Yes, I'm fine.

781
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:52,090
Why did you come here
instead of heading home?

782
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:53,759
I'm good to work now.

783
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:55,886
Where's Chief Kook?

784
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:57,512
He went to the Gyeonggi Agency.

785
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:00,140
The Gyeonggi Police Agency?

786
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,517
Why did he go there?

787
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:18,366
TRUSTWORTHY POLICE
SAFE AND STRONG COUNTRY

788
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:22,245
There was a bus stop
in front of the karaoke bar, right?

789
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,414
-Yes, there was.
-Okay.

790
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:27,918
The missing person's job group
is completely different though.

791
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:30,086
But the area is all very similar.

792
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:36,384
Hey, how did you know I was here?

793
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:38,053
Are you feeling better?

794
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,472
Yes.

795
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,975
-It's been a while.
-Have you been well?

796
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:51,441
Woo-ju briefed me on the case
when I got to the office.

797
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,401
Can you explain the case to me in detail?

798
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:56,738
All right. As it was reported here,

799
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:59,616
a woman went missing
from a karaoke bar in April.

800
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:01,451
But back in February,

801
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,203
another employee from a karaoke bar

802
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:05,288
went missing but it wasn't reported.

803
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:07,123
Then two days ago, on the 23rd,

804
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:10,627
a female university student went missing
from the same bus stop.

805
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:13,004
I think it's the same perp
for all three cases.

806
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:16,967
When we visited the crime scene
for the case in April,

807
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,635
there was a bus stop there too.

808
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:20,220
What about the unreported case?

809
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:22,055
There was a bus stop there too.

810
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:26,017
All three cases happened
in a desolate area.

811
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,563
He's looking at the location.

812
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:32,315
You figured that out already?

813
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:38,488
No witnesses, right?

814
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:39,614
That's right.

815
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:42,784
So if we take Chief Kook's guess
and assume that all three

816
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:44,369
were abducted from a bus stopâ€¦

817
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:46,413
That means they were waiting for the bus.

818
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:47,539
What time did this happen?

819
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:51,001
All of their phones went radio silent
around 1 a.m. in the morning.

820
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:53,587
They were waiting for the last bus.

821
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:57,007
He might have forced them into the car.

822
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:00,385
Don't you need at least two people
to force an adult into your car?

823
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,179
They were offered a free ride.

824
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,390
-What?
-A free ride, you say.

825
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:07,851
If there are two culprits,
there's no good reason

826
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,352
to abduct women at a bus stop.

827
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:12,981
They can just target a woman walking alone
and abduct her by force.

828
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:19,571
I think there's a high chance
that it's the same culprit.

829
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:23,033
-Chief Park.
-Yes?

830
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,452
Let's form an investigation team.

00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:29,039
{\an8}GYEONGGI INVESTIGATION HEADQUARTERS

JANUARY 2007

833
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,882
Let us in on the investigation too.

834
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:44,679
We have experience
working with the Analysis Team.

835
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,890
I'm sure we'll come in handy.

836
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:49,935
All right, fine.

837
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:52,771
I'll ask the Gyeonggi Agency
for permission to cooperate.

838
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,440
-Thank you, sir.
-All right.

839
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:59,277
You'll be working at the
Gyeonggi Agency for a while, right?

840
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,862
Yes, probably.

841
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,114
Hold on.

842
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:08,286
Hey, what should I do with this?

843
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,788
Should I rip it up?

844
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:10,830
RESIGNATION LETTER

845
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,457
-Come on.
-Should I?

846
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,378
You're so twisted.

847
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,966
Woo-ju. Rip that up into pieces
once we leave.

848
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:22,342
I'll do as you command.

849
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:24,427
-I'm counting on you, Woo-ju.
-Sure thing.

850
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,137
"Woo-ju," please?

-Yes, sir.

{\an8}MISSING WOMEN CASES IN GYEONGGI

854
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,025
There were no security cameras
at the scene.

855
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,069
Most of those areas don't have any.

856
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:43,530
They're building
new apartment complexes there.

857
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,741
The district office didn't even look
for installation spots.

858
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:49,411
The culprit knows
the area is pretty desolate

859
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:50,662
with no security cameras.

860
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:53,707
I think we should install security cameras
not just in this area,

861
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,835
but also at every bus stop
with no security cameras in Gyeonggi.

862
00:54:56,918 --> 00:55:00,255
-Every single one?
-Yes, switch out the old ones too.

863
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:03,174
You can barely make out license plates
with the older models.

864
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:06,261
You think it's that simple?

865
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:07,929
The Ministry of Finance has toâ€¦

866
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,016
Fine. I'll talk to them.

867
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:13,935
Then I'll check for areas
with no security cameras.

868
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:16,187
-All right.
-Thanks, I appreciate it.

00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:32,037
Yes, thanks to you.

872
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:35,165
Thanks to me?

873
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:38,877
You played a part in my
joining the Analysis Team.

874
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,338
I see you can make jokes now.

875
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:46,468
The rumors about Chief Kook
whipping you into shape was true.

876
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,845
Yes, he sure did.

877
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:51,139
I was appointed to a new station
so suddenly,

878
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:52,974
so I couldn't reach out.

879
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:56,519
Anyone would've done the same thing.

880
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:59,397
It's all in the past now.

881
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:01,733
I'm just glad we met again.

882
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:05,695
Let's do our best.

883
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:22,045
Did you hear the rumors
about you whipping me into shape?

884
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:25,507
What kind of absolute nonsense is that?

885
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,717
Who whipped who into what?

886
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:29,260
People just love to gossip.

887
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:31,221
What's wrong with it?

888
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:34,599
Don't let rumors bother you.

889
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:38,770
It's true though.

890
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:43,608
The buses run in
40 to 50-minute intervals.

891
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:44,692
That's quite a wait.

892
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:47,904
Right. There aren't many taxis either.

893
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:50,198
Even more so at night.

894
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:51,783
He probably had that in mind.

895
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,245
The security camera installation
is finalized, right?

896
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:57,789
Yes. They'll install more
in the areas of disappearance

897
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,541
and all nearby locations.

898
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:11,803
SINBON 2-DONG OFFICE

899
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:19,185
I hope the cameras help.

900
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:22,230
I'm sure he'll be more cautious
with the lack of blind spots.

901
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,816
It's been over nine months now.

902
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:26,985
I hope they are alive.

903
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:31,114
At least none of the missing women
were found dead.

904
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:33,408
Yes, you're right.

905
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:35,410
We should be hopeful.

906
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:37,829
Let's go over there.

907
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:59,309
He's the statistical analyst
of the Analysis Team.

908
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:02,020
His name is Jung Woo-ju. He's a smart guy.

909
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:03,229
My name is Yoon Tae-gu.

910
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:05,398
I'll leave.

911
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:11,279
Did you have customers
who offered to give people a ride?

912
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:14,032
BUS STOP

913
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:15,658
It's cold. Hop in.

914
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:17,785
-I'll take you to the main street.
-Right.

915
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:21,831
SUSPECT ANALYSIS

916
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,041
PROFILING REPORT

917
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:24,667
GYEONGGI INVESTIGATION HEADQUARTERS
OF SERIAL MISSING WOMEN CASE

918
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:27,504
All three cases broke out
when the wind chill factor was low.

919
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:30,548
It was a secluded area,
so buses didn't come often.

920
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:32,592
I stood alone at the bus stop,

921
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:35,887
<i>but a truck came by and offered me a ride
out into the main street.</i>

922
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:38,515
You won't find a bus here
even if you waited.

923
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:41,309
The culprit takes advantage
of the victim's situation and psychology.

924
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:42,894
The buses don't run often,

925
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:45,063
so it's common for people to give rides

926
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:46,981
in that neighborhood.

927
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:50,360
On a cold day, it must've been easier.

928
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:54,030
So the culprit used the kind face
as a mask to lure them?

929
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:55,490
Yes.

930
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:59,369
Even so, how can they gladly
hop into a stranger's car?

931
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:00,703
They didn't hop in gladly.

932
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:03,748
The culprit must've
convinced them to hop in.

933
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:07,460
Then the culprit must drive
a luxurious sedan that seems familiar.

934
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:11,256
Or have something in his car
that drives away people's suspicion.

935
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:14,050
A family photo? Or stuffed animals?

936
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:18,304
-A baby?
-Let's say a baby is in the car.

937
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:21,140
Then people rarely
ask anybody else to join them.

938
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,935
The first thing
the victim looks at is the driver.

939
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:26,938
So I think the suspect may look amicable,

940
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:29,148
someone who doesn't draw
people's suspicion.

941
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,276
I'm sure the culprit isn't intimidating.

942
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,485
Must be likable.

943
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:34,862
You're right.

944
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,034
Hello? Chief Kook.

945
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:42,203
I'll send you a fax.
Please take a look at it.

946
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:44,914
Yes, a cold case for a missing person.

947
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:47,834
Yes, in Gunpo.

948
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:49,294
GUNPO

949
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:51,504
Yes, I'll check.

950
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:54,716
One second.

951
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,843
Woo-ju just sent over
a missing person case.

952
00:59:56,926 --> 01:00:01,347
The victim is Heo Geum-young,
51 years old, who went missing in Gunpo.

953
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:02,432
And is it similar?

954
01:00:02,515 --> 01:00:03,891
She went missing

955
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:06,269
at a bus stop in a secluded area.

956
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:09,522
Her phone battery got separated
around that area.

957
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:10,940
Seems possible.

958
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:13,234
-He sent us a fax.
-I'll pick it up.

959
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:14,360
No, I got it.

960
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:15,653
I'm going to the restroom.

961
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:20,158
-She was 51 years old?
-Yes.

962
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:25,330
Hey.

963
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:28,458
We just heard
about the cold case in Gunpo--

964
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:34,422
Yes. One second.

965
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:36,049
Hey, don't hang up.

966
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,885
It's a word on a missing case.

967
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:41,638
No, not the Gunpo cold case.
Not that one. Something else.

968
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:44,599
Suwon Seobu Police Station.

969
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:46,017
An office worker, in her thirties.

970
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,936
<i>That neighborhood recently
became filled with industrial parks.</i>

971
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,439
<i>The missing person worked in
Haeyong Industrial Park.</i>

972
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:54,108
<i>She usually commuted by bus
at the bus stop</i>

973
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:55,485
<i>in front of her workplace.</i>

974
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:58,196
<i>That area only has
industrial parks around,</i>

975
01:00:58,279 --> 01:01:00,615
<i>so everything is pitch dark at night.</i>

976
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:03,618
<i>Her phone battery was pulled out
at 7 a.m. the next morning.</i>

977
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:05,953
MISSING PERSON

978
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:23,721
A HILL IN ANSAN, GYEONGGI PROVINCE

979
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:05,430
Hello, Chief Park?

980
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:07,265
We found Yoon Jin-sil's body.

981
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,809
The karaoke bar employee
who went missing in January.

982
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:11,477
Did you see the news?

983
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:14,105
She went missing,
then was found buried in secret.

984
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,524
I should check on my wife.

985
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:17,900
That's horrendous.

986
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:19,318
{\an8}MISSING KARAOKE BAR EMPLOYEE
IN HER THIRTIES, FOUND DEAD IN ANSAN

987
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:31,164
Get up here!

988
01:02:35,376 --> 01:02:36,252
Go up!

989
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:38,838
Something might come out,
so keep digging up there!

990
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:40,047
Yes!

991
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:45,720
{\an8}FOUND NAKED
WITH STOCKINGS TIED AROUND THE NECK

992
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:53,603
GYEONGGI PROVINCIAL POLICE AGENCY

993
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:57,023
Ansan is pretty far
from the last phone signal

994
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:58,524
and where she went missing.

995
01:02:58,608 --> 01:02:59,984
You're right.

996
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:01,694
Why didn't he go near Anyang?

997
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:05,990
I'm not sure why he went
all the way to Ansan to bury her.

998
01:03:06,073 --> 01:03:09,452
The farther one travels,
the riskier it becomes.

999
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:11,829
He probably didn't make a move by day.

1000
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:14,499
He went around at night
when it was difficult

1001
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:16,000
to spot his car on camera.

1002
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:17,960
He either lived in Gyeonggi
for a long time,

1003
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:21,005
or he must know the area well.

1004
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:22,965
Gimpo, Anyang, Suwon, and Ansan.

1005
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:25,176
He usually found the most secluded areas.

1006
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:28,012
Lots of places don't show up
on GPS in that area.

1007
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:30,139
You're right, on top of that,
he buried her

1008
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:32,141
in a hill 80m away from the road.

1009
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:34,769
If it hadn't been for that elderly man

1010
01:03:34,852 --> 01:03:36,521
who goes there every day,

1011
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:39,398
it would've been impossible
for an ordinary person to spot.

1012
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:40,817
Then let's find the cars

1013
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,109
that we can distinguish

1014
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:43,569
from the security footage.

1015
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:45,863
We have no choice

1016
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:49,116
but to narrow down our suspects
to ex-convicts living in Gyeonggi.

1017
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:52,161
There must be a reason
why he chose this spot.

1018
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:56,541
Once we find some suspects,
we'll also find the reason.

1019
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:59,126
Detective Nam.
Put together a list of ex-convicts.

1020
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:00,253
Yes, sir.

1021
01:04:47,508 --> 01:04:48,843
AN YU-YEON

1022
01:04:58,936 --> 01:04:59,979
You're sound asleep.

1023
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:11,365
INSERT CARD

1024
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:16,078
{\an8}PLEASE ENTER YOUR PIN

1025
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:26,172
<i>Please take your cash.</i>

1026
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:28,257
<i>Your transaction has been completed.</i>

1027
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:30,009
<i>Thank you for using Hanyoung Bank.</i>

1028
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:49,946
CCTV FOOTAGE EVIDENCE

1029
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:51,697
Was this the person you saw?

1030
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:56,869
Yes, his hair and outfit were odd,
so I remember him.

1031
01:05:56,953 --> 01:06:00,414
-He had this bushy bang.
-I see.

1032
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:03,417
And he was wearing a dress shirt
with sweatsuit pants.

1033
01:06:04,418 --> 01:06:06,796
-Was this the jacket too?
-Yes.

1034
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:09,966
He looked at me
after he withdrew the money,

1035
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:11,592
so I stared back.

1036
01:06:12,176 --> 01:06:14,136
Did you see where he went?

1037
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:17,807
I wouldn't know.

1038
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:21,686
I saw him catching a taxi.

1039
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:24,021
A taxi?

1040
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:28,567
<i>A female university student in Gunpo
has been missing for 18 days,</i>

1041
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:30,903
<i>so the police began an open search.</i>

1042
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:34,448
{\an8}<i>The police obtained footage
of a man in his twenties to thirties</i>

1043
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:39,078
{\an8}<i>withdrawing 700,000 won
with this woman's debit card at a bank.</i>

1044
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:42,415
{\an8}<i>He's now openly wanted as the key suspect.</i>

1045
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,542
Yes, all right.

1046
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:47,878
I checked with the taxi company,

1047
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:50,172
and they haven't found the driver yet.

1048
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:53,676
If he took a taxi,
he probably lives near the bank.

1049
01:06:53,759 --> 01:06:55,761
The bank is close to where
she went missing.

1050
01:06:56,345 --> 01:07:00,016
It won't be easy,
but let's check every security camera

1051
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:03,185
on the streets from the missing point
to the bank.

1052
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:09,442
We'll check every footage
within six kilometers of the bank.

1053
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:10,901
Everything?

1054
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:13,320
There are at least
over 300 cameras out there.

1055
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:15,281
Yes, we'll check everything.

1056
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:16,365
Please cooperate.

1057
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:17,908
-Okay.
-Okay.

1058
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:24,040
Right here.

1059
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:30,546
What were you doing then?

1060
01:07:31,922 --> 01:07:33,841
I was at home.

1061
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:40,806
Darn it.

1062
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:46,270
Let's keep trying.

1063
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:54,737
Gyeonggi 89.

1064
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:58,866
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1065
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:12,213
Hold on.

1066
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:15,591
Could you rewind the footage just now?

1067
01:08:17,384 --> 01:08:19,845
Yes. That one. Please zoom in.

1068
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:28,187
-Chief Kook. Come over here.
-Yes?

1069
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:09,895
STAY TUNED FOR THE EPILOGUE

1070
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:36,046
Gosh.

1071
01:09:36,755 --> 01:09:40,134
I've been working in the force
for about 30 years.

1072
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:41,802
And in my opinion,

1073
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:46,932
you're the best cop in Korea.

1074
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:50,227
That was out of the blue.

1075
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:53,564
I've never seen you second guess yourself.

1076
01:09:53,647 --> 01:09:56,483
You only focus on your job.
You don't let the job get to you.

1077
01:09:57,109 --> 01:09:59,486
So for the past 20 years,
I have been watching you

1078
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,947
doing so well without much trouble.

1079
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:08,162
And I realized that people like you
were born to be police officers.

1080
01:10:08,245 --> 01:10:11,290
And I was proud to have
a competent junior like you.

1081
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:15,628
But the guy you scouted, Song Ha-young,

1082
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:17,922
is just like you.

1083
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:19,882
He reminds me of you in every sense.

1084
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:22,551
How does he remind you of me?

1085
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:28,182
Ha-young is young, handsome,

1086
01:10:28,849 --> 01:10:30,392
and looks great with a perm.

1087
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:35,147
You two can't see it.

1088
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:37,483
But in other people's eyes,

1089
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:40,236
Kook Young-soo and Song Ha-youngâ€¦

1090
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:42,863
are the same.

1091
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,243
So that got me worried all of a sudden.

1092
01:10:47,993 --> 01:10:49,119
Worried about whom?

1093
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:51,205
Isn't it obvious? It's you.

1094
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:53,582
Why? I'm a grown man.

1095
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,173
It's easy to come back
after running away once.

1096
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:03,676
Butâ€¦

1097
01:11:04,885 --> 01:11:07,471
two people who never
thought about running away

1098
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:12,017
ended up working together.

1099
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:13,852
So I was worried thatâ€¦

1100
01:11:16,563 --> 01:11:18,983
both of you might give up
if one of you crumbled down.

1101
01:11:23,654 --> 01:11:25,072
You do have a point.

1102
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:29,868
That's how I feel right now.

1103
01:11:32,871 --> 01:11:35,499
Just like you said,
I've been wrong for the last 20 years.

1104
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:40,671
It doesn't feel like
I've been focusing on my job.

1105
01:11:43,173 --> 01:11:45,134
Because I was too busy with my job,

1106
01:11:46,593 --> 01:11:48,929
perhaps I failed to
take care of those around me.

1107
01:11:50,931 --> 01:11:53,767
And I wonder if I've been
doing it wrong the whole time.

1108
01:11:56,186 --> 01:11:57,396
Young-soo.

1109
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:02,943
Cops are human too.

1110
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:09,992
Get in. I had fun today.

1111
01:12:10,075 --> 01:12:12,328
-Let's grab one more drink.
-We've had enough.

1112
01:12:13,787 --> 01:12:16,081
-Sir, please drive him home safely.
-Sure.

1113
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:17,708
Apartment Complex Seven in Mok-dong.

1114
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:20,252
-You can go.
-One more drink.

1115
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:21,795
-Bye.
-Wait.

1116
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:23,088
One more!

1117
01:12:25,257 --> 01:12:26,800
Thanks, Gil-pyo!

1118
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:40,606
Woo Ho-sung?

1119
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,649
You wanted to see me?

1120
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:45,027
<i>Can we talk at the station?</i>

1121
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:47,363
<i>Are you suspecting me?
Do you have evidence?</i>

1122
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:50,449
We can't let this guy buy time.
He'll destroy all the evidence.

1123
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:51,867
<i>This bastard is unbelievable.</i>

1124
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:53,494
<i>What if I'm not the culprit?</i>

1125
01:12:53,577 --> 01:12:55,871
<i>I'm sure he was psychologically pressured.</i>

1126
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:00,209
-Who's calling?
-This is Woo Ho-sung.
