Look over there.

10
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,398
Come closer.

11
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:51,194
Should we pedal all the way there?

12
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,112
Sure. Let's go.

13
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,906
Pedal.

14
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:57,992
-Faster.
-Darn it.

15
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,371
Hey.

16
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,376
-Hey, look out!
-What? Over there!

17
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,546
Oh, no. My balloon!

18
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,883
Ha-young!

19
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:15,635
Please help!

20
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,848
Please help! I need help over here!

21
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,615
-Come on.
-The students were messing around.

22
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,617
And that kid fell into the water.

23
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,245
-My goodness.
-That's how they found her.

24
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,622
Ma'am.

25
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,593
Excuse me. Ha-young.

26
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,053

27
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,273

<i>Brief me.</i>

31
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,263
I haven't seen
even a single ant over here.

00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,390
<i>Closing news.</i>

33
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,267
<i>There have been many cases of break-ins</i>

34
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,768
<i>at multiplex houses since 1997.</i>

35
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:31,271
<i>Women were sexually assaulted and robbed.</i>

36
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,855
-<i>This is the Red Cap Incident</i>.
-None.

37
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,065
<i>It continues to take place.</i>

38
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,609
<i>-The police haven't made progress.</i>
-How much longer?

39
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,695
<i>So the public is worried for their safety.</i>

40
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,364
<i>The police announced
that they will reinforce the patrol</i>

41
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,907
<i>in alleys and residential areas</i>,

42
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:46,452
<i>and they would do their best
to arrest the culprit.</i>

43
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,329
{\an8}Gosh. This is killing me.

44
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,499
It's March. How come it's still freezing?

45
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,711
It's always cold when we're on a stakeout.

46
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:55,962
Hey.

47
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,006

DONGBU POLICE STATION VIOLENT CRIMES
ASSISTANT INSPECTOR SONG HA-YOUNG

49
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,968
I can't believe we can't even go home

50
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,178
because we have to catch a sex offender.

51
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,346
What is this?

52
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,432
This has been going on for ten months.

53
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,350
And there have been 12 victims.

54
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,935
Besides, this is our job.

55
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,063
Think about the victims.

56
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,356
Stakeouts are nothing.

57
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,692
Sure. That's why we must catch him.

58
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,779
What if he doesn't show up
now that we're waiting for him here?

59
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,034
This kind of sting operation
has no foundation.

60
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,078
We'll put this
one-dimensional approach behind

61
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:33,374
in the 21st century and move forward
with more futuristic methods, right?

62
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,335
-What do you mean by futuristic?
-I don't know.

63
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,547
I'm just frustrated.
So I'm spitting out ideas.

64
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,133
I'm frustrated too.

65
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,094
Gosh. You have to speak up now.

66
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,221
I come here every day,
and I only saw one cat.

67
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,348
Right.

68
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,184
We'll be back tomorrow anyway.

69
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,935
-Take out the walkie-talkie.
-Okay.

70
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,397
Let's see.

71
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:59,776
Captain, we'll wrap up for the night.

72
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:02,570
Captain, it's snowing.
Let's call it a night.

73
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:03,988
<i>Okay. Let's wrap it up.</i>

74
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,032
<i>Come back here tomorrow at 10:00 p.m.</i>

75
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,951
-See you later.
-Bye.

76
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,584
<i>Gosh. It's freezing out here.
Let's try again tomorrow.</i>

77
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,920
<i>-We're wrapping up. Go home.</i>
-What?

78
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,254
We can go home?

79
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,965
It's so cold.

80
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,301
Why is it snowing in March?

81
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,971
-Let's go.
-It's too early.

82
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,890
It's 3 a.m. already.

83
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,559
Here's what I think.

84
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,104
That punk must know that we're here.

85
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,022
So we should rest up too.

86
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,982
Let's come back when he least expects it.

87
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,360
Crime also happens
when one least expects it.

88
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,820
Gosh. I know that.

89
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:47,198
Who's going to know
all the work we do here?

90
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:50,034
We're not making any progress
with our investigation.

91
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,370
Darn it.

92
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,539
People just call the cops incompetent.

93
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,584
You go home then. I'll stay a bit longer.

94
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,087
If you do things on your own,

95
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,297
Captain Park is going to
give me an earful.

96
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,632
Will you stay then?

97
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,220
See you later.

98
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,225
Right.

99
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,227
Don't tell Captain Park about this.

100
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,311
Sure. Go home.

101
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,813
-Bye.
-Okay. See you later.

102
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,816
What do you want to eat?

103
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,234
I'm not going to eat.

104
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,195
Come on. Just show up already.

105
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:10,698
Red Cap.

106
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,577
That's not your house.

107
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,038
Come here.

108
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,042
It won't take long.

109
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,085
Darn it.

110
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,136
Hey!

111
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,182
Are you okay?

112
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:51,531
Come here.

113
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,007
Gosh, the weather's so inconsistent.

114
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,593
Why is it raining?

115
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,179
-Let's go.
-Darn it.

116
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,103
<i>He was just pretending to be Red Cap?</i>

117
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,814
<i>He has five priors for rape and assault,</i>

118
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,275
<i>but he has an alibi
for every Red Cap Incident.</i>

119
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,776
<i>He did it because the red cap</i>

120
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,945
<i>makes victims unable to resist
due to fear.</i>

00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,252
-Why do you think he did it?
-What do you mean?

126
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,713
Hey.

127
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,593
I don't even want to know
what scumbags like him are thinking.

128
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:36,844
Why?

129
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,138
That's just how they were born.

130
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,598
He's not thinking.

131
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,726
Exactly. We caught him,
so why let him mess with you?

132
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,144
Mess with us?

133
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,021
With our minds.

134
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,939
We already have enough to worry about.

135
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:52,360
Once the case is closed,
it's wise to not think about it again.

136
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,904
Do you ever use your brain to think?

137
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,365
Let's go eat something.

What do you want?

139
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,160
-Not coming, right?
-No, go ahead.

-Yes.

00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,659
I booked your next appointment

151
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,828
for the date the doctor suggested.

152
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,539
Next time,
make sure you come with the father.

00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,582
Okay, I will.

154
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,585
-Thank you.
-Get home safely.

<i>Regarding the Red Cap Incident,

They still haven't caught him?

00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,800
When will he be caught?

158
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,302

My gosh.

163
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,215
You should've just bought an umbrella.

164
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,217
You're soaked.

165
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,344
-When did you get here?
-Goodness.

166
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,763
I brought you winter cabbage
and green onion kimchi.

167
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:29,808
My gosh, your fridge was a mess.

168
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,852
I threw out the spoiled food
and cleaned everything.

169
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,062
I made barley tea too.

You always do everything and nag me.

171
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,775
Go inside.

172
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,736
It's raining. You should just sleep here.

Don't stay out too late. My goodness.

You're old enough to know
that it's a scary world.

Just sleep here tonight.

176
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,411
I have to go to work tomorrow.

177
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,913
Take a taxi. I'll give you the money.

178
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:54,041
Why waste money when I can take the bus?

00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,834
-Forget it.
-Wait!

00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,211
All right.

181
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,549
Leave the kimchi out for two days.

182
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,425
-That way, it'll age well.
-Okay.

183
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,635
Bye.

184
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,265
You're making me uncomfortable.
Just go inside.

185
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,266
Get going.

186
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,934
I'm not a kid.

187
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,394
Bye.

188
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,233
-Make sure you take a taxi!
-Okay.

189
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,403
-Mom!
-Yes?

190
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:24,822
Bye.

191
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,325
Bye. Don't forget to lock the door.

192
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,326
Okay.

193
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:22,588
It's good.

194
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,004
You scared me.

195
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,217
You didn't lock the door.

196
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,594
The landlord had a break-in.

197
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,054
Make sure you lock the door.

198
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,182
When did you get here?

199
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:18,060
-You forgot to take an umbrella, right?
-How did you know?

200
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,187
The floor was wet, so I wiped it.

201
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,232
-Right.
-I should've picked you up.

202
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,570
Are you having <i>ramyeon</i>?

203
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,697
You want some too?

204
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,408
I should head back out.

205
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,035
I stopped by to see you before work.

206
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,705
Can't you just skip work
and stay with me tonight?

207
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,167
I should work hard to earn more money

208
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,211
so that you can live comfortably.

209
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,341
I don't want to be alone.

210
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,510
Everyone's rejecting me today.

211
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,887
-What?
-My mom was here.

212
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,646
It's just a food stall.
Can't you just hang out with me today?

213
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:08,652
"Just a food stall"?

214
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,031
Sorry. Don't get me wrong.

215
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,741
Did you say "just a food stall"?

216
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,956
Look at you belittling me again.

217
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,209
What do you mean again?

218
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:28,297
You get all sensitive
whenever I talk about the food stall.

219
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,552
Honestly, it makes you look so insecure!

220
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,721
You little…

221
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,741
I'm sorry.

222
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,035
Darn it. What a way to ruin my night.

These?

254
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,200
Yes.

255
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:03,911
May I have one more?

256
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,581
Thank you.

{\an8}CHOI HWA-YEON'S HOME

258
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,253
{\an8}DO NOT ENTER, UNDER INVESTIGATION

259
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,720
Hey, where have you been?

260
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:22,930
Goodness.

261
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:05,472
The victim's mother said her daughter
came home around 10 p.m. two days ago.

262
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:08,433
She couldn't reach her
so she came here and made a report.

263
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:16,608
What about her family?

264
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,568
She has a mother,

265
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,905
but she was in bad condition
and was taken to the hospital an hour ago.

266
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,264
<i>She was in awful condition,</i>

267
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,975
<i>so I just injected her
with a sedative and sleeping agent.</i>

268
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,838
<i>Whenever he's at the crime scene,</i>

269
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,549
<i>the first thing he does
is look for the bereaved family.</i>

270
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,469
<i>If he was staging this,
he couldn't do it for so long.</i>

271
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,846
He's an outcast, but he has no idea.

272
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,264
That's odd too, isn't it?

273
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,516
Do you think he doesn't know?

274
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,894
So he does?

275
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:36,188
Then how can he be so cool about it?

276
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,566
Don't you think
he's the one casting us out?

277
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,318
What?

278
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:44,863
<i>I heard he got transferred here
because he has always been like this.</i>

279
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,783
<i>Some say he's the nephew
of the commissioner.</i>

280
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,495
<i>The son-in-law of the brother
of the third cousin of his in-law.</i>

281
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:54,956
Goodness, word gets around
weirdly in this industry.

282
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,958
Captain.

283
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,711
Going back on a case
that his direct superior closed.

284
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,880
It's not easy to do that.

285
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,048
Just do your job.

286
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,841
Stop minding something unnecessary.

287
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,010
And stop talking to me when I eat.

288
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:08,970
Okay.

289
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,814
-You're home.
-Yes.

290
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,233
You look tired. You should go to sleep.

291
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,609
I will. Goodnight.

00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,368
-Hey, Gil-pyo.
-Found it.

296
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:14,995
This is really important.

297
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:17,581
Hey, Red Cap
is turning the world upside down.

298
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,748
Why are you here?

299
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:21,126
There will come a day
when you'll say I was right.

300
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:24,963
Hey! I'm about to lose my joints
running after this case.

301
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:28,049
-That's because of your age.
-Darn you. You won't be young forever.

302
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,468
{\an8}CHIEF OF SPECIAL CRIME SQUAD,
HEO GIL-PYO

303
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:33,013
We already have Forensics.

304
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:36,808
We don't have grounds to establish
a Scientific Investigations Team.

305
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:40,187
Even an open-hearted guy like me
doesn't understand why we need that.

306
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,480
But the higher-ups? They won't understand.

307
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,441
I explained it to you so many times.

308
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:45,609
You still don't get it?

309
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:48,236
We're already short on staff.

310
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,155
Would you spend money to make this team?

311
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,489
-Think about it.
-Come on.

312
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,949
"Hey, you rascal!

313
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,952
"Go catch another criminal
if you have time, you foolish kid."

314
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,078
Wouldn't they say that?

315
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,079
Exactly.

316
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:01,166
We need that team
in order to catch one more criminal.

317
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:03,793
Those who have been here for too long
don't speak my language.

318
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,795
Goodness, you didn't know?

319
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:09,007
The men who have a say in this,
those who have been here for too long,

320
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,093
hate unfamiliar methods
more than bad methods.

321
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,180
So you should give up on your dream.

322
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,557
A dream is meant to be had.

323
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,894
-Hey, Superintendent Baek.
-Hey.

324
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,938
Goodness, what's going on?

325
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,232
Is he still at it
about the scientific investigation?

326
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:28,526
Tell me about it.
We're all busy, but he must be free.

327
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,362
Gil-pyo, do you have to be like this?

328
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,614
My dear Chief Kook Young-soo of Forensics,

329
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,907
stop talking to me.

330
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,785
You can talk directly
to Superintendent Baek Jun-sik.

331
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,536
Talk to me about what?

332
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,039
-My goodness.
-Good grief.

333
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,012
Do you know how important profilers are?

334
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,016
Yes, I do. Pro fliers, like pilots?

335
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,310
{\an8}If we want to conduct
scientific investigations,

336
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,229
{\an8}do we have to get on a plane too?

337
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:09,442
The higher the building goes,
the longer its shadow will be.

338
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,196
Goodness, that's a famous quote
from that ancient show, <i>Chief Inspector</i>.

339
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,783
I guess Young-soo
isn't that young after all.

340
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:19,703
With the IMF,
the buildings have crashed down.

341
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:22,872
What shadow? You must have
a lot of time on your hands.

342
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,086
Listen up.

343
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,462
Very soon,

344
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:32,465
we will see brutal and heinous criminals
like the ones in the US.

345
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,759
These criminals have no motives.

346
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,303
Then what do we do?

347
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,972
We have to be prepared
to deal with criminals like them!

348
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,307
Hey!

349
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,350
I can't take this anymore.

350
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,978
Are you praying for something big
to break out?

351
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,939
Why don't you go and pray
that a huge case will break out,

352
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,108
into a bigger one,
and into an even bigger one?

353
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,693
That's not what I meant.

354
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,446
You know what I mean.

355
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,159
When's Park Chan-ho game?

356
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,205
Young-soo.

357
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,124
Let's grab one later.

358
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:12,464
I'm sorry.

359
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,217
She was pregnant.

360
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:20,680
-Pregnant?
-Yes, about 14 weeks.

361
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,350
Man, that son of a bitch.

362
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,810
She died from asphyxiation
due to cervical compression

363
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,021
and mechanical airway obstruction
of the nose and mouth.

364
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,856
The estimated time of death

365
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:32,525
is between 10 p.m. to midnight
on the 15th.

366
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:36,363
The temperature of her rectum
shows that it was around 10:30 p.m.

367
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,198
The contents of her stomach show

368
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:40,909
she ate something
within an hour before her death,

369
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,535
so around 11 p.m.

370
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,621
Other than the victim's mother,

371
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:49,876
the time of her death coincides
with the time of Bang Ki-hoon's visit.

372
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,544
But there's no sign of rape.

373
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,005
Wait. What about her clothes?

374
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,800
There's no sign of rape,
but he undressed her?

375
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,551
It's Bang Ki-hoon for sure.

376
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,472
So Bang Ki-hoon is your friend?

377
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,395
We only went to the same high school.

378
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,068
{\an8}TEMPORARILY CLOSED DUE TO PERSONAL MATTERS

379
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:19,447
Mr. Bang Ki-hoon?

380
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,243
We're from Dongbu Police Station.
Come with us.

381
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,036
Why should I?

382
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,621
Do you know Choi Hwa-yeon?

383
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,250
-She's my girlfriend.
-Exactly.

384
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,629
You're arrested for the suspicion
of Choi Hwa-yeon's murder.

385
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,507
Murder?

386
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,051
Murder? What do you mean?

387
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,096
Murder?

388
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,597
Is Hwa-yeon dead?

389
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,767
We can talk about the details
at the station.

390
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,604
You were going to run away?

391
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:52,856
Too bad.

392
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:55,233
You missed your window by a close call.

393
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,568
I'm not running away.

394
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,403
Do you have an arrest warrant?

395
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,700
Bang Ki-hoon.
You have the right to remain silent.

396
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:07,203
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

397
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,998
You have the right to an attorney.

398
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,917
Hwa-yeon is dead?

399
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:19,883
I didn't do it.

400
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,885
Yes. Right on cue.

401
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:25,263
That's what everyone says.

402
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:28,224
I really didn't do it. Why would I…

403
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:31,144
All the circumstantial evidence
is pointing to you.

404
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:35,940
You were at her house
at the estimated time of death.

405
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,902
<i>And we also found
your fingerprints at her house.</i>

406
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,821
Why would I kill my girlfriend?

407
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:42,781
Exactly.

408
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,657
That's what I would like to know too.

409
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,410
Why did you kill your girlfriend?

410
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,870
I didn't kill her.

411
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:54,209
Then where did you go
after leaving her house?

412
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,585
You didn't work that night.

413
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:02,425
You don't have anyone
to support your alibi, right?

414
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,844
I went to the Han River.

415
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:06,930
Come on.

416
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,682
At least make it sound believable.

417
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,184
Is that the best you can do?

418
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,352
I'm telling the truth.

419
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:16,064
We fought that night
and I wasn't in the mood to work.

420
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:18,817
That's it.

421
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,486
Your motive for killing Choi Hwa-yeon.

422
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,779
It was…

423
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,949
a small argument.

424
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:30,119
Do you kill your girlfriend
over some argument you have?

425
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,788
That's the difference between us.

426
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:34,290
You're sitting there and I'm sitting here.

427
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,000
We're only one meter apart.

428
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,253
But there's a huge gap
between our humanity.

429
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:40,964
Detective.

430
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,591
I really didn't do it.

431
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,261
Are you…

432
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,680
Red Cap?

433
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:51,683
What?

434
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:56,187
We got a report that someone saw a man
in a red cap around that time.

435
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,946
TURTLE SUPERMARKET

436
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,827
<i>A man without an umbrella
was walking, not running.</i>

437
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,538
<i>I just thought that it was because
he was wearing a cap.</i>

438
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,957
<i>Was it red?</i>

439
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,334
I think it was.

440
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,253
-A red cap?
-Yes.

441
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,338
Do you remember anything else about him?

442
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:24,883
As for his height…

443
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:30,430
I'm not sure.

444
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:32,849
Anyway, he was pretty short like a girl.

445
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,143
Detective.

446
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,897
What can I do to make you believe me?

447
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,941
Show me evidence you didn't do it.
Then I'll believe you.

448
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,651
We only believe in evidence.

449
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,403
But you don't have evidence. Do you?

450
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:47,655
The door.

451
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,534
The door wasn't locked.

452
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,079
Think carefully before you speak.

453
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,624
This statement could work against you.

454
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,506
I'm not the one.

455
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,596
You have a record for assault.

456
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,098
And pretending you left the gang
with that food stall.

457
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,726
I'm not pretending.
I'm done with that life.

458
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:19,312
Whatever it is, I don't care.

459
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:23,149
But people like you
get hot-tempered just like now.

460
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:26,194
And when you do,

461
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,488
you unintentionally
end up hurting people, right?

462
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,156
Just be honest.

463
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,617
I don't kill people.

464
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:36,412
Are you a gang member who has a heart?

465
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,960
Did your dead girlfriend know

466
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,628
that you used to be in a gang?

467
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,885
Then did you know…

468
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,764
that Choi Hwa-yeon was pregnant?

469
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,520
What do you mean?

470
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,106
Given that you were dating,

471
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:06,067
you two kept a lot of secrets
from each other.

472
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,694
I'm telling you.

473
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:12,490
You can't just rely on tangible evidence.

474
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:16,494
Well, without the evidence,
we'd be shooting blind.

475
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,746
Then what do you suggest?

476
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,124
What should we rely on?

477
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:26,087
-How they prepared to commit crimes.
-Right.

478
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,465
And how and why they committed crimes.

479
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,843
And how the corpses were handled.

480
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:35,930
We should be studying the entire process.

481
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:39,308
-Right. And scientifically too.
-Yes.

482
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:40,643
Science.

483
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,770
Come on. Stop talking about science.

484
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,605
Hold on.

485
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:48,067
Do you have to get the license
to be a pilot or whatever that's called?

486
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,990
What? Why are you laughing?

487
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:56,284
Are you Choi Bool-am or what? "Pilot"?

488
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:59,579
-Gosh. You're so frustrating.
-You're frustrating.

489
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:02,373
It's not a pilot. It's a profiler.

490
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,876
-Right. A profil…
-A profiler.

491
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,502
A profiler.

492
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,755
All right. I'm sorry.

493
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:12,341
By the way, who's going to do that?

494
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:13,843
I know just the guy.

495
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,804
He's more stubborn than I am.

496
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,724
-Gosh. He sounds like trouble.
-Goodness.

497
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:45,708
TEMPORARILY CLOSED DUE TO PERSONAL MATTERS

498
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,295
<i>Bang Ki-hoon. Did you really do it?</i>

499
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,561
Gosh, he's taking a while.

500
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,983
There were a lot of petty thieves
in that neighborhood.

501
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:14,070
The landlord on the second floor
was robbed of their valuables too.

502
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:16,739
When?

503
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,784
About a month ago.

504
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:23,121
Their house had a smart door lock.

505
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,622
When did you check that?

506
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,836
Wait. Are you going there?

507
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:33,214
Gosh. You really shouldn't.

508
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,466
You killed a person. You bastard.

509
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,386
You scum.

510
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,930
You should feel guilty.

511
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,226
What?

512
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,353
What are you doing?

513
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,105
Getting a confession out of him.

514
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,189
Close the door.

515
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:52,775
We're not done, you piece of trash.

516
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,861
You jerk.

517
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:01,284
What's the problem? What is it?

518
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,703
Do you think
this kind of confession is valid?

519
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:07,165
Don't act all righteous and lecture me.

520
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:08,958
Get back to work.

521
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,501
This is my work too.

522
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:20,845
Gosh. Come on.

523
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,809
Get out.

524
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:34,859
He can't even give me his alibi right now.

525
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,737
Why? Because he killed her.

526
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,072
You know he was there
at the estimated time of death.

527
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:46,162
Your friend from school
fought with Choi Hwa-yeon that day.

528
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:50,750
He didn't call her for a few days,
so he had no idea she was dead.

529
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:53,753
-You think that makes any sense?
-She was pregnant.

530
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,713
Bang Ki-hoon might not be the culprit.

531
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:58,507
You think murderers have mercy?

532
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,509
They don't.

533
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,929
But it was too bad for him.

534
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,848
He didn't even know she was pregnant.

535
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,266
Hey.

536
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,937
She must have hidden the fact
that she was pregnant for a reason.

537
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,774
Even if I want
to be lenient with him, I can't.

538
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,692
Even his motive is crystal clear.

539
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:21,447
These gangsters will never learn.

540
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,491
They get hot-tempered and cause trouble.

541
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,368
They are dumb to stage a perfect crime,

542
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,203
but they don't want to serve time.

543
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,664
But you still want to believe that guy?

544
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,332
That's not what I'm saying.

545
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,668
I just want to find definitive evidence.

546
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,711
You said you weren't friends with him.

547
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,631
Then listen up.

548
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,550
Those bastards…

549
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,719
don't deserve to be called human.

550
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:47,807
And beating those scumbags
is the fastest and the easiest way.

551
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,559
But this is still wrong.

552
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,776
I know why you got kicked out
of Jungbu Police Station,

553
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:04,115
but don't try to police your supervisors
by nitpicking us.

554
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,993
Just get out there and catch criminals.

555
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:09,954
Just go out there.
You have a lot of work to do.

556
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,269
Hey.

557
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,689
Investigate him in connection
with the Red Cap case.

558
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:38,065
Yes, sir.

559
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,693
But he didn't rape her,
and the method is different.

560
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:43,321
Such perverted acts
are no different from rape.

561
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,289
Wait, where are you going?

562
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:54,915
To find evidence.

563
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,712
My goodness.

564
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,154
<i>The first reason
why Ki-hoon isn't the killer.</i>

565
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,866
<i>There are signs of forced entry.</i>

566
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,410
<i>The second reason why he isn't the killer.</i>

567
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,496
<i>Choi Hwa-yeon was pregnant.</i>

568
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,790
Then did you know…

569
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,334
that Choi Hwa-yeon was pregnant?

570
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:41,504
<i>But he didn't know,
and he denied all charges.</i>

571
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,302
<i>The first reason
why Ki-hoon is the killer.</i>

572
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,389
<i>His prints and blood
were found at the scene.</i>

573
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,641
<i>The second reason why he is the killer.</i>

574
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,643
<i>The estimated time of death also matches.</i>

575
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:56,936
That bastard…

576
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,730
Your little friend from school

577
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,400
<i>fought with Choi Hwa-yeon that day.</i>

578
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:06,570
<i>Clear motive. Reason number three.</i>

579
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:10,032
Show me evidence you didn't do it.
Then I'll believe you.

580
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:11,909
<i>He has no alibi.</i>

581
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,627
<i>Reason number four.</i>

582
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,963
<i>He entered through the door
instead of the window.</i>

583
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,093
I should really move.

584
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:31,637
Petty thieves are one thing,
but someone died.

585
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,014
I'm so terrified
I can't live here anymore.

586
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,349
Even I'm this scared.

587
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,101
So I'm worried the house won't sell.

588
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:39,520
Who else had break-ins in this area?

589
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:42,857
There were three to four other cases,
just counting the ones I heard of.

590
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,650
That's the problem.

591
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:47,528
The stolen goods aren't that valuable,
so the cops don't care.

592
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,988
It's been so long.

593
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:51,824
If it was a rich family,
the thief would be in jail.

594
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:54,743
Was there another break-in downstairs
before this incident?

595
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,371
No, not that I know of.

596
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,623
Okay, thank you for your cooperation.

597
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:00,875
Detective.

598
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,085
Can you catch the thief
who stole my jewelry

599
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:06,088
while tracking down the jerk
who killed the lady downstairs?

600
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,840
Okay. Just a moment, please.

601
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,140
Ma'am, these numbers here.

602
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:17,641
Did you write them?

603
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,269
What is that?

604
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:21,187
My goodness.

605
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:24,356
Why would I doodle on the wall?
I'm not a kid.

606
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,067
Maybe my granddaughters wrote them
when they came over.

607
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,032
Anyway, thank you.

608
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:36,577
Detective, please catch that thief.

609
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,205
THEFT REPORT

610
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,918
Five cases were reported in total.

611
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,587
There was a break-in every two weeks
until three months ago.

612
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:49,632
The last one was the two-story house
at 214 Daebong-dong?

613
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,926
Yes, this jerk is clever.

614
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,469
He never breaks into houses with men.

615
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:56,472
And only steals cheap items.

616
00:41:57,014 --> 00:42:00,309
It's so petty that there are
no leads on him whatsoever.

617
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,102
So Dongbu Police Station has given up.

618
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:05,064
We've enhanced patrols in the area.

619
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:07,066
Thankfully, it's been quiet since then.

620
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,360
Okay, thank you.

621
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:13,531
DAEBONG PRECINCT

622
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,624
<i>Daebong-dong, 183-10.</i>

623
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,589
<i>The number, 233.</i>

624
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,009
Hey! Who are you?

625
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,427
-What are you doing?
-Hold on!

626
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,096
-Ma'am, hold on!
-Why are you lurking around?

627
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:39,807
-I'm a police officer!
-Why? What?

628
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:40,849
I'm a police officer.

629
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,895
Then why didn't you ring the doorbell?

630
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,773
Why did you lurk around my house?
It looked so suspicious.

631
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:50,609
-My gosh.
-I'm sorry. It was getting late.

632
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,194
What can I do for you?

633
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:54,488
I have a few questions.

634
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:55,781
What is it?

635
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,993
Do you happen to know
what these numbers are for?

636
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,120
That's not my address.

637
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:02,830
What is it?

638
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:05,249
-Mom.
-Yes?

639
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,418
Why did you come out?

640
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,422
Who's in your family?

641
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:13,591
Me and my kids. Just the three of us.

642
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:15,884
What about your husband?

643
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,052
Why do you ask?

644
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,096
I'm investigating the area.

645
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,391
We don't live together.

646
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,518
I see. I'm sorry.

647
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,397
You don't think your kids
wrote the numbers, do you?

648
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,566
They're not tall enough
to reach that high.

649
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:31,734
I see.

650
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:34,486
Thank you for your cooperation.

651
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,698
Sure. Come on. Let's go back inside.

652
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,366
Bye, Mr. Policeman.

653
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,993
-Hurry, go inside.
-Goodbye.

654
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:42,620
-Gosh, this neighborhood.
-Sorry.

655
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:53,047
<i>Daebong-dong, 190-3.</i>

656
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,256
<i>The number, 22.</i>

657
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,175
Who do you live with?

658
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,344
Just me and my sibling. Why do you ask?

659
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:00,763
Your sibling? Sister or brother?

660
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:02,139
Sister.

661
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,099
Who do you live with?

662
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,601
I live alone.

663
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:08,228
Who do you live with?

664
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,564
My mom. It's just the two of us.

665
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,073
<i>The number is on every third house.</i>

666
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:26,872
Who do you live with?

667
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:29,124
I live with my wife. What's this about?

668
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,127
-Who is it?
-Hello.

669
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:35,047
My wife and I live here
with our ten-year-old son.

670

<i>Choi Hwa-yeon's landlord's house had 233.</i>

671
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,227
<i>The house with two kids
also had 233 written on the wall.</i>

672
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,145
<i>These numbers seem random.</i>

673
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:51,563
<i>What could they mean?</i>

674
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,530
Gosh, that bastard. He should watch out.

675
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:08,747
<i>Maybe my granddaughters wrote them
when they came over.</i>

676
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:11,917
<i>Me and my kids. Just the three of us.</i>

00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,549
DO YOUR DUTY

678
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:20,342
The restaurants in this area.

679
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,010
How many of them offer delivery?

680
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:25,013
-Delivery?
-See these numbers?

681
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:27,182
What is this?

682
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,767
It shows who lives in the house.

683
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:30,811
Two for women. Three for kids. And one…

684
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,231
means an adult male.

685
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,567
The culprit avoided houses where men live.

686
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,652
He only targeted houses
with women and kids.

687
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:40,946
But what does that have to do
with delivery?

688
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:43,198
It has to be someone with a job…

689
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,118
that can figure out
who lives in the house.

704
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:24,781
-A comment!
-Move back!

705
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,700
-Look here!
-Say something!

706
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:28,994
-Why did you do it?
-How do you feel now?

707
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:30,704
-Just a comment!
-Wait!

708
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:32,581
Do you admit to all charges?

709
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:34,541
-Wait!
-Just a comment!

710
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:40,005
<i>Unlike the previous cases
that took place in the victims' homes.</i>

711
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:43,258
<i>-This incident took place…</i>
-How dare you smirk? Is this funny?

712
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:45,427
Request an arrest warrant.

713
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:46,762
Yes, sir.

714
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:48,805
Detective, it really wasn't me.

715
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,265
Why would I kill Hwa-yeon?

716
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,809
-Sit down.
-That scum.

717
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,062
Song Ha-young, right?

718
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:59,233
The culprit picked the lock.

719
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,692
Look, these numbers…

720
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:02,444
Your friend already confessed.

721
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:09,368
Goodness. Should I go to
a temple somewhere and pray?

722
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:11,828
Talk about bad timing.

723
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,250
How could he kill his own girlfriend?

724
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:19,711
It really wasn't me. Please believe me.

725
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,922
Hey, I've seen plenty of scumbags

726
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:24,466
who killed their wives, daughters,

727
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,927
and even their own parents
in the spur of the moment.

728
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,137
A girlfriend? That's nothing.

729
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,557
Goodness, me and my bad luck.

730
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,476
I caught a murderer,

731
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,937
but that bastard is getting
all the spotlight now.

732
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,942
They only care because she was pregnant.

733
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,902
Why did he take her clothes off?

734
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,196
I guess he's a twisted pervert.

735
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:49,074
You expect me to know
his sexual preferences too?

736
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:52,578
If you're that curious,
just ask his friend over there.

737
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:58,417
That guy isn't the culprit.

738
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,587
Get up and follow me.

739
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,923
Going to the Special Crime Squad?

740
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:07,801
Why would I go there?
We're the ones who caught him.

741
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:09,177
All right.

742
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,890
The lucky ones
always fall on a pile of gold.

743
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:32,451
Hey!

744
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,829
I know you're Red Cap.

745
00:48:35,912 --> 00:48:37,039
Why?

746
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:39,916
Do you wish I wasn't?

747
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,169
You're nothing but a little puppy.

748
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,629
Don't try to act tough.

749
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,276
That guy isn't the culprit.

750
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,279
<i>Is Bang Ki-hoon the real culprit?</i>

751
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:13,283
<i>His eyes weren't that
of a criminal's eyes though.</i>

752
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:20,540
Detective.

753
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:23,627
Please…

754
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:28,632
Do everything you can to catch the guy

755
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,093
who killed my daughter.

756
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:36,098
Choi Hwa-yeon's boyfriend, Bang Ki-hoon.

757
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:39,518
He's the culprit.

758
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:43,146
Did you say "boyfriend"?

759
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:46,983
Hwa-yeon had a boyfriend?

760
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:52,280
<i>She hid her pregnancy and even the fact
that she had a boyfriend.</i>

761
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:54,658
<i>Is Bang Ki-hoon the real culprit?</i>

762
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:58,495
Goodness me.

763
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:05,669
Of all the things to take after me,
it had to be my bad luck with men.

764
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:19,474
I'm so sorry, Hwa-yeon.

765
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:23,228
I'm sorry, Hwa-yeon.

766
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:32,404
I should have stayed with her that day.

767
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,450
She asked me to sleep over.

768
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:41,288
She offered, but I declined.

769
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:51,882
It's not your fault.

770
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:55,719
I should have died instead of Hwa-yeon.

771
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:18,074
My gosh, Hwa-yeon.

772
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:25,457
My gosh, Hwa-yeon.

773
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:30,712
Goodness.

774
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:35,717
SOONAE HOSPITAL
EMERGENCY ROOM

775
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:07,165
{\an8}CHIEF OF FORENSICS
KOOK YOUNG-SOO

776
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,250
Hello?

777
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:10,585
Chief, this is Ha-young.

778
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,254
Yes?

779
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:14,714
I have a favor to ask.

780
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:26,601
-You're here.
-Yes.

781
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:27,686
Here.

782
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,023
Gosh.

783
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:37,070
Where is it?

784
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:46,621
They may have missed
something the first time.

785
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,248
The prints were only on the cup.

786
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:52,252
If Bang Ki-hoon cleaned it all up,
why would he have left just this?

787
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:53,920
Everything matches.

788
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:56,631
From his fingerprints,
bloodstain, and time of death.

789
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:58,842
He even confessed.

790
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:00,677
That's true, but…

791
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,345
You just got to Dongbu Station.

792
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:03,638
Will you be okay?

793
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,934
I came because you asked,

794
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,394
but just as a case is important,

795
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:11,938
-relationships are also--
-You're right.

796
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,107
But catching the culprit
is the most important.

797
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:15,692
You never give in to anything.

798
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:19,905
I heard the suspect is your friend.

799
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,116
Did you do a background check?

800
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:24,743
That's nonsense.

801
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:26,411
I call it "having interest."

802
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,580
We're basically strangers.

803
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:30,415
Being friends doesn't change anything.

804
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:31,541
As I told you earlier…

805
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,209
All right, I got it.

806
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,421
I'm good with just our relationship.

807
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:40,091
That's why I couldn't refuse.
You know that, right?

808
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,052
Thank you.

809
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:43,720
Express it a little for me then.

810
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:47,432
-Here?
-No, forget it.

811
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:53,396
The fact the culprit was calm enough
to erase his footprints and fingerprints

812
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,690
means that the crime
was most likely planned.

813
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:59,444
A woman living alone in a one-bedroom…

814
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:03,281
The killer may have been
hiding and waiting.

815
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:08,703
Either underneath this bed…

816
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,458
or behind here.

817
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,407
Hey. Have you gone mad?

818
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:49,035
Damn it.

819
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,248
Why did you ask to run prints
on a case that's closed?

820
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:54,874
Why?

821
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,960
You said that Bang Ki-hoon
isn't your friend!

822
00:54:57,877 --> 00:54:59,004
That's not the reason.

823
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:02,966
Friend or not. This case is over.

824
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:05,343
Bang Ki-hoon confessed!

825
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,265
That's because you forced a confession--

826
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:12,350
You're a complete lunatic, aren't you?

827
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:14,269
Is Bang Ki-hoon stupid?

828
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:15,854
Why would he lie?

829
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:18,023
He did say he didn't kill her.

830
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:21,026
Damn you, you crazy bastard.

831
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:27,115
Is it your hobby
to screw your superiors over?

832
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:29,325
What's the problem?

833
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:31,911
I'm just saying
Bang Ki-hoon may not be the culprit.

834
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,038
If he's not…

835
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,332
If Bang Ki-hoon isn't the culprit…

836
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:38,918
What are you going to do about it?

837
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,422
If that's the case,
we'll have a bigger problem.

838
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:44,924
You know that.

839
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,885
-Know what? You bastard!
-Captain!

840
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:48,094
-You know?
-Calm down.

841
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,637
-You know nothing!
-Please!

842
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:51,389
Step outside for a moment, please!

843
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:52,891
Calm down, Captain.

844
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:54,100
Hey!

845
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:57,562
You'd better fix your attitude
if you want to keep this career.

846
00:55:57,645 --> 00:55:58,772
You got it?

847
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:01,191
DETECTIVE DIVISION

848
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:07,030
-Yes?
<i>-Inspector Song Ha-young?</i>

849
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:10,241
<i>I'm calling to notify you
that the fingerprint results are in.</i>

850
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:13,453
<i>But we were unable
to confirm the identity.</i>

851
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:21,753
I understand the frustration,

852
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:25,006
but you have to accept the outcome.

853
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,299
-You're here.
-Yes.

854
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:31,304
My instincts are telling me otherwise.

855
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:34,516
I know we can't take
a detective's instincts lightly.

856
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:37,977
But we have definite evidence
and his confession too.

857
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,104
That's true, but…

858
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,440
The fact that
the victim's wallet disappeared,

859
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,651
how she was left undressed,

860
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,778
<i>and the trace of breaking in.</i>

861
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:49,030
<i>And the suspicious numbers on the walls.</i>

862
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:50,907
All those things are bothering me.

863
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:54,494
If it were a premeditated crime,

864
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:56,871
why was she left undressed?

865
00:56:58,123 --> 00:56:59,999
The killer must've been busy covering up.

866
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:04,379
Have you heard about profilers?

867
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:08,299
We call them criminal behavioral analysts.

868
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:10,844
You have all the qualifications…

869
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:12,762
a profiler needs.

870
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:16,850
First, your refusal to give up.

871
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:19,060
-All detectives--
-You also have an open mind.

872
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:22,689
Intuition, general knowledge,
and the skill to analyze logically.

873
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:25,066
And also a detachment
of personal feelings.

874
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,943
But more important than all that…

875
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:30,196
The thing I find most important
is sensitivity.

876
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:31,906
"Sensitivity"?

877
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:35,201
Would it be easier to understand
if I say sensitivity towards others?

878
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,162
Why would you need that?

879
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:40,874
Because it's a job
that analyzes people's minds.

880
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:45,044
Goodness. You only say
the most confusing things.

881
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:48,006
Hey, take this.

882
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:51,634
Give it a read when you have time.

883
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:55,597
And have some of these when you have time.

884
00:57:57,515 --> 00:58:00,727
Thank you. What is this?

885
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,730
I'm making an attempt to form a new team.

886
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:06,065
I think I found the right guy…

887
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,610
as a criminal behavioral analyst.

888
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:12,197
It's the perfect job for someone like you.

889
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,073
I'm fine with what I do now.

890
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:18,786
Hey, if you turn me down just like that,
you'll hurt my feelings.

891
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:23,583
It's tough to tell…

892
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,586
what you're thinking.

893
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:28,796
But that's also a strength for a profiler.

894
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:30,757
Are you teasing me?

895
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,218
No, I'm very serious.

896
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,262
You don't have to decide right away.

897
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,515
It'll take some time to make the team.

898
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:43,269
But for now, just remember that there is

899
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:45,021
something like this.

900
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:54,948
Where do you think you're going?

901
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,783
You knocked her out. Then what?

902
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,661
Yes, you got on top of her.

903
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,621
And strangled her, right?

904
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:02,872
How did you do it?

905
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,123
{\an8}SUSPECT

906
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,208
Her neck.

907
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,418
You strangled her, right?

908
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:11,756
Man, this guy is driving me insane.

909
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,759
Hey, your hands weren't like that.

910
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:19,764
You pushed your hands up to her chin
and strangled her.

911
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:22,517
Start pressing.

912
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,270
You did this, so why don't you remember?

913
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:27,230
Do it.

914
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:31,109
We're running out of time. Hurry up.

915
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:32,777
Keep taking the video.

916
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:36,948
After you strangled her, what's next?

917
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:38,866
And then what? You unbuttoned her shirt.

918
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:41,619
Take her clothes off.

919
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:44,747
-Why did you kill your girlfriend?
-All right.

920
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:47,292
Tell us the motive of your murder!

921
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,691
Bring my daughter back!

922
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:16,696
<i>The victim lost her irreplaceable
and precious life</i>

923
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,781
<i>at such a young age.</i>

924
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:23,119
<i>It is clear the victim's family
will live in pain</i>

925
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:26,623
<i>for the rest of her life,
along with a psychological shock.</i>

926
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:31,377
<i>The crime of taking another person's life</i>

927
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,755
<i>is serious and unacceptable.</i>

928
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,716
<i>And the accused
did not reflect on his crime</i>

929
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,259
<i>despite his history of assault.</i>

930
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:41,888
<i>It was concluded
that his crime was heinous.</i>

931
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:45,600
<i>Hence, the court sentences
Bang Ki-hoon, the accused,</i>

932
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:48,728
<i>to 12 years in prison.</i>

<i>The police…</i>

952
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:02,593
I'm back.

953
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:05,638
-You brought it back?
-Goodness, you didn't have to.

954
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:06,973
It didn't take long.

955
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:09,684
Good work, Kang-moo. You should go home.

956
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:11,352
Thank you, sir.

957
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:12,937
-Good work today.
-Good work.

958
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:14,313
Take good care of your grandma.

-Okay. Goodbye.
-Bye.

<i>He's very diligent,

<i>Whenever he gets paid,</i>

965
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:33,499
<i>he takes it to his grandmother.</i>

<i>Ha-young, what did you do
with your friends today?</i>

971
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,682
This lady looks sad.

01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:42,438
-Yes.
-Why is she sad?

973
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:50,112

01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:52,281

Ha-young.

979
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:07,254
Come here.

980
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:14,428
It's not that Ha-young isn't sympathetic.

981
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:16,847
He's very sympathetic.

982
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:19,141
I'm not sure if you'll understand.

983
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:22,311
But he can look deeply
into people's inner sides.

984
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,480
<i>Their inner sides?</i>

985
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:27,733
Ha-young. What about your umbrella?

986
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:30,528
I gave you an umbrella this morning.

987
01:06:31,195 --> 01:06:32,321
Where is it?

988
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:36,033
<i>Ha-young is only nine years old.</i>

989
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:38,411
<i>It's because he's a child.</i>

990
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:41,914
<i>He sees a difference between his feelings
and other people's reactions.</i>

991
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:49,046
<i>He must have realized
that he is different from others.</i>

992
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:51,215
<i>Seeing the dead body that day…</i>

993
01:06:52,049 --> 01:06:54,010
<i>triggered this thought in his head.</i>

994
01:06:55,219 --> 01:06:59,890
<i>So he's trying to hide his emotions.</i>

995
01:07:00,474 --> 01:07:01,726
Don't worry, Ha-young.

996
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:03,561
I will bury it in a nice place.

997
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:08,024
Come here.

998
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:26,167
<i>I want to know
why you thought he didn't do it.</i>

01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:27,835

it'll happen again.

1002
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:34,717
<i>This news shocked the public.</i>

1003
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:39,555
<i>That a detective keeps visiting him
and asking him for advice!</i>

1004
01:07:39,638 --> 01:07:41,348

Others couldn't understand, but you
instinctively knew this was necessary.

<i>I'm certain that you're
the perfect person for this job.</i>
