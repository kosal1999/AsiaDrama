VISITATION REQUEST FORM

00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,695
NAME: YANG YONG-CHUL

15
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:56,991
VISITATION REQUEST COUNTER

16
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,369
Okay.

17
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,334
Inmate 3585.

18
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,963
He refused the visitation request.

19
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,551
-Have a good day.
-Thank you.

20
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,890
<i>Inmate 3585.</i>

21
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,517
He refused the visitation request.

22
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,438
<i>Inmate 3585.</i>

23
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,899
He refused the visitation request.

24
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:32,777
<i>Inmate 3585.</i>

25
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,363
<i>He refused the visitation request.</i>

26
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:46,541
<i>Detective, why don't you send some money
to his commissary account?</i>

27
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,667
Come on.

28
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,412
What's this about?

29
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,959
You don't even know who I am.
Why did you refuse to see me?

30
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:30,960
Well…

31
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,171
There's no one who would visit me.

32
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:37,091
And whenever someone came to see me,
it was never good news.

33
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,845
Why did you think he wasn't the culprit?

34
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,060
That guy isn't the culprit.

35
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:54,234
I see. You have a good memory, Detective.

36
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,528
But you kept coming here because of that?

37
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,284
That's odd.

38
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,745
I want to know

39
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,622
why you thought he wasn't the culprit.

40
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,082
Why do you want to know?

41
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,250
You won't tell me?

42
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,834
Why should I tell you that?

43
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,294
You don't need money?

44
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,631
Well…

45
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:21,177
I can tell just by looking at their eyes.
Here's a thing about hunches.

46
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,681
Detectives aren't the only ones
who have them.

47
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,477
He stripped the girl naked.

48
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,190
And he killed her
in the heat of the moment.

49
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,777
If that's the case, why strip her naked?

50
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,532
And she was his girlfriend.

51
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:49,747
Allegedly, he killed her
in the heat of the moment.

52
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:54,002
They must have been in love, right?

53
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,421
Even if he killed her, it was a mistake.

54
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,424
Or an accident?

55
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,134
Okay. Let's call it an accident.

56
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,428
Then he would have dressed her
if she was naked.

57
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,471
That's what a normal guy would do.

58
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,265
Only those who have killed before

59
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:10,184
would strip their victims naked.

60
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,519
That's my point.

61
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,652
You know what habits are, right?

62
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,446
Old habits die hard.

63
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,823
And you end up doing these habits

64
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,283
before you realize it.

65
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,453
What does that have to do with this case?

66
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,415
When I was a kid,

67
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,126
my father always beat me up
during our meals.

68
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,753
Do you know why he beat me up?

69
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:41,257
Because I always left a spoonful of rice
instead of finishing it.

70
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,011
It's odd. I just didn't want to eat
the last spoonful of rice.

71
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,846
Eating the last spoonful made me feel…

72
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,892
like I was losing my spirit.

73
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,481
That was an exaggeration.

74
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,484
Anyway, he beat me up for leaving rice
because it'd be bad luck.

75
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,110
But I still don't finish my food.

76
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,529
There's no one who would beat me

77
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,406
for leaving the last spoonful now.

78
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,910
Let me sum it up.

79
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:11,287
No matter how meticulously
you plan something,

80
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,416
your habits come out like second nature.

81
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,043
That's my point.

82
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,298
I'm sure there was a reason
behind stripping her.

83
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,634
He had to strip her to get off.

84
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,052
And whoever did that…

85
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,554
is the real culprit.

86
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:34,227
Just like how I had to leave
the last spoonful of rice to be satisfied

87
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:39,148
no matter how much my father beat me up.

88
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,320
I bet I'm right about this.

89
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:48,241
Detective Song Ha-young.

90
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,707
-Gosh. Again?
-His MO is bothering me.

91
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:00,086
I'm sure it's related
to Won Mal-sook's case in Uyeong-dong.

92
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,587
What MO?

93
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,131
It's the way she was killed.

94
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,092
She was also found naked
without any signs of sexual assault.

95
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,594
He did that to humiliate the victims.

96
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,596
The case is closed. Stop causing trouble.

97
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,057
It's not a request. I'm warning you.

98
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,314
Hey. Answer me.

99
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,025
Don't do anything.

100
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,527
I warned you!

101
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,779
Hey! Darn it.

102
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:49,260
WON MAL-SOOK'S RESIDENCE

103
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,576
<i>Signs of forced entry.</i>

104
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,162
<i>No numbers.</i>

105
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:10,049
SERVICE, ORDER

106
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,969
-Here, this is for you.
-Thank you.

107
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,483
My gosh, you must have a sweet tooth.

108
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,068
Yes.

109
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,737
All the detectives
at Dongbu Police Station are busy,

110
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,864
so we thoroughly investigated
the case, but…

111
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,658
I'm sure you couldn't catch
that petty thief.

112
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,411
Like you suggested last time,

113
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,330
we questioned all the delivery guys
who work in the area

114
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,999
but couldn't track him down.

115
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,586
I think it made him nervous though.
Things have been quiet since then.

116
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,671
We've further enhanced
patrols in the area.

117
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,465
Was there anyone suspicious?

118
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,844
There was a kid
who looked quite suspicious.

119
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,305
<i>He's just a punk who bullies
other kids in the area</i>

120
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,223
<i>and extorts chump change from them.</i>

121
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,810
<i>We brought him in to question him
and checked his alibi too.</i>

122
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,438
<i>The thing is, he always wore a red cap.</i>

123
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,608
Red Cap has been caught.

124
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,235
I know that, but we all thought
he seemed suspicious,

125
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,945
so we questioned him.

126
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,616
I heard the man the lady at the store saw
was wearing a red cap.

127
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,659
Witness statements are confidential.

128
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:22,121
I'm a regular at the store,
so that lady and I are quite close.

129
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,831
She was scared because she saw him,

130
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,750
<i>so she asked me to keep an eye out.</i>

131
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,918
<i>I made sure to patrol the area more often.</i>

132
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,092
I found that cap.

133
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,220
It's true.

134
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,851
Is it common for youngsters your age
to use things that others threw out?

135
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,770
It was from a designer brand.

136
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,272
-Can I see it?
-I threw it out.

137
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,400
-You did?
-Darn it.

138
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,486
I had to go to the police station
because of it.

139
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,696
I said it wasn't mine,
but no one believed me.

140
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,531
-How tall are you?
-Me?

141
00:10:58,699 --> 00:10:59,533
I'm 183cm.

142
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,912
<i>Anyway, he was pretty short like a girl.</i>

143
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,665
-I can go now, right?
-Wait.

144
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,251
The houses in the area have numbers
like this by the entrance.

145
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,087
Do you know what this means?

146
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,673
Isn't it the street address?

147
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,637
How would I know?

148
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,556
This is so annoying.

149
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,234
Captain.

150
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,111
About the Uyeong-dong case.

151
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,780
Won Mal-sook's prints
were the only thing they found.

152
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,365
FINGERPRINT ANALYSIS REPORT

153
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:43,619
WON MAL-SOOK

154
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,079
What the hell?

155
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,790
<i>His MO is bothering me.</i>

156
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,918
I'm sure it's related
to Won Mal-sook's case in Uyeong-dong.

157
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,851
Hand it over.

158
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,400
See you again.

159
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,696
Catching the culprit
doesn't mean it's over.

160
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,198
What? Our job's done
the moment we lock them up.

161
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,533
What more do we have to do?

162
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:25,411
We should record everything
these criminals said and did

163
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,163
so we can prevent future crimes and…

164
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,831
Right.

165
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,875
You always blow things out of proportion.

166
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,585
No! My goodness.

167
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,003
Whatever.

168
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,255
Even the crime records.

169
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,841
You request them for no reason
and let them sit on your desk.

170
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,260
That made everyone
from the 31 stations in Seoul

171
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,971
hurl criticism at me
and Superintendent Baek.

172
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,890
I'm sure it'll be useful one day.

173
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,516
When? How?

174
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,226
Gosh, why are you so negative?

175
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,061
Come on. It helped us organize

176
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,105
all the files on serious crimes.

177
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,732
It wasn't so bad.

178
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,359
I guess you're a glass-half-full
kind of person.

179
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,694
By the way,

180
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:03,866
detectives feel satisfied
when they run around and cuff criminals

181
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,409
with their own hands.

182
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,495
That profiler or whatever it's called.

183
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,247
Are you sure that person is on board?

184
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,832
Don't worry about that.

185
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,292
Just form the team.

186
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,835
Well…

187
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,463
That's not something I can decide.

188
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,298
-Yes, you can.
-Gosh, that's hot.

189
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,716
Give us this new team.

190
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,719
Excuse me.
Could you give us more radish kimchi?

191
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:24,845
Goodness.

192
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,184
FAMILY VISITATION ROOM

193
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,986
I suppose what I told you wasn't useless.

194
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,448
Did something else happen?

195
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,284
What floor?

196
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,706
The first floor. But I guess
he's targeting other houses too.

197
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,874
Some of them are on the second floor.

198
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,002
I guess he's skilled at picking locks
and jumping over walls.

199
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:00,839
Well, home is the safest place.

200
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,092
No one else can see what you do,

201
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,177
except for you and the victim.

202
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,846
There were no signs of sexual assault.

203
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,724
Gosh. He's a pervert
that strips victims naked.

204
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,059
Is that not sexual assault?

205
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:15,104
And that's why you came to see me.

206
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,231
All right. Look.

207
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,609
I got caught because I dragged her
to the parking lot.

208
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,863
I got horny, so I did something
I don't usually do.

209
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,241
Oh, boy.

210
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:31,036
This is why you should always
plan everything and stick to it.

211
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,371
Don't you agree?

212
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:35,541
Then why did you deviate from your plan?

213
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,794
Because I was sure I wouldn't get caught.

214
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,389
Then should I look for ex-cons
for robbery and rape in the area first?

215
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,309
I guess that's an idea.

216
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,688
You're leaving already?

217
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:00,983
I'm telling you.

218
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,944
This guy is sick in the head.

219
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,988
He's obsessed with undressing his victims.

220
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:10,492
Detective.

221
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,287
Will you visit me again?

222
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,000
You know…

223
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,336
I'm an orphan,

224
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,130
so my commissary account is always empty.

225
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,424
Now that I got a little taste of it…

226
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,885
I must say, it's very nice.

227
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,138
Oh, boy.

228
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,015
An orphan?

229
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,143
You went on about how your father…

230
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,812
always scolded you at mealtimes.

231
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:39,897
Goodness.

232
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:43,067
I only call him like that
because I have no other option.

233
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,069
He doesn't deserve to be called a father.

234
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,613
He sent his own child to an orphanage.

235
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,950
That is all I remember…

236
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,869
about the man called my father.

237
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,044
DONGBU POLICE STATION

238
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,254
That's nuts.

239
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,259
Okay.

240
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:13,722
Hey.

241
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,183
Goodness.

242
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,313
I heard you visited Yang Yong-chul again

243
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,774
and even deposited cash
into his commissary account.

244
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:29,113
What an embarrassment. I'm humiliated.

245
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:32,533
Criminals understand each other better.

246
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,742
What?

247
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,369
Hey, kid. What is he saying?

248
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,417
I clearly warned you not to cause trouble.

249
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,712
Apparently,

250
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,840
Yang Yong-chul is going on about it,
all excited.

251
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,092
That a detective…

252
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:55,180
That a detective keeps visiting him

253
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,058
and asking him for advice!

254
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,270
The things Yang Yong-chul is saying…

255
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:03,605
make sense.

256
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,733
You've clearly lost your mind.

257
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,568
Fine.

258
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,945
Criminals understand
each other better. So what?

259
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:10,988
We need to catch him.

260
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,781
-Who?
-The real culprit.

261
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,246
Are you doing this…

262
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,958
to rebel against me?

263
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,420
What do you mean?

264
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,922
I caught the culprit
and put him behind bars.

265
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,091
But you're digging it up again,
insisting he's not the real culprit.

266
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,634
Talk about being disrespectful.

267
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,969
No, that's not it.

268
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,638
I'm just trying to tell you
it's related to this case.

269
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,265
What will you do if Yang Yong-chul

270
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:41,060
starts running his mouth,
talking nonsense?

271
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,146
You'll ruin the police's reputation.
But that's secondary.

272
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,982
What will you do
if the higher-ups hear about it?

273
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,193
Who will take responsibility for it?

274
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:51,987
I will.

275
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,118
Who do you think you are?

276
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,871
Who do you think you are
to take responsibility?

277
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,000
If you were given responsibility
because you're such a hotshot,

278
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,376
then why were you sent here?

279
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,754
If the real culprit is out there,

280
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,548
who'll take responsibility
for Bang Ki-hoon's life?

281
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,051
You little rascal.

282
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,682
Hey, you know what?

283
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,893
You should just be the culprit.

284
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,854
You said criminals understand each other.

285
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,148
You can become a culprit yourself.

286
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:32,820
I'll arrest you, break your neck,
and throw you in prison.

287
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,532
The culprit for Bang Ki-hoon
and Won Mal-sook's cases is the same.

288
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,576
It's his habit
of leaving the victim naked.

289
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,870
And he's become even bolder.

290
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,748
He won't stop here.

291
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,546
Were you not listening to anything I said?

292
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,924
I'll catch the culprit.

293
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:59,763
DO NOT ENTER, UNDER INVESTIGATION

294
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,363
<i>Sexual trauma.</i>

295
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:17,990
<i>Housebreaking.</i>

296
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,825
<i>History of robbery.</i>

297
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,286
<i>But he doesn't show up in the system.</i>

298
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,455
<i>The MO is the same,
but this one didn't have a sign.</i>

299
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,124
<i>Has he become bolder?</i>

300
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,835
<i>Or was this really done by someone else?</i>

301
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,921
{\an8}LIST OF EX-CONVICTS
FOR ROBBERY AND RAPE IN SEOUL

302
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,643
I narrowed down the suspects
in Won Mal-sook's case.

303
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,061
What's this?

304
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,938
Ex-convicts who are good at housebreaking.

305
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,274
Do you remember
the scratches on the keyhole

306
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,026
found at Choi Hwa-yeon's place?

307
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,069
-Yes.
-It's from opening it by force.

308
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,362
Look. It was found again.

309
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,699
But this is a common technique.

310
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,784
I'll narrow it down to those
who worked as a deliveryman.

311
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,703
Deliveryman?

312
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:08,874
Most of the houses including the one with
the theft were marked like this.

313
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,710
See?

314
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,754
I'm sure it was him.

315
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,005
A deliveryman.

316
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:17,132
Bang Ki-hoon's case, 214 Daebong-dong.

317
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,301
The recent case, 712 Uyeong-dong.

318
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,677
They aren't too far apart.

319
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:24,014
I'll narrow down the residence
using the two areas and find the suspect.

320
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:39,947
43-1 U-YEONG-DONG

321
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:44,868
Darn it.

322
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:48,830
Who is it?

323
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,708
Who is it?

324
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,128
Detective Song Ha-young of Violent Crimes,
Dongbu Police Station.

325
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,131
What? I didn't commit any crimes.

326
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,550
I just need to confirm your alibi.
I will ask--

327
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:04,096
You randomly come and treat a perfectly
innocent guy like me like a criminal,

328
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,723
when all I am trying
to do is live a good life.

329
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,480
Goodness, why are you so angry?

330
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,691
-I just need to ask a few…
-Darn you.

331
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,247
Get out. I don't know.

332
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,915
Why are the police hassling me?

333
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,542
I just need to confirm your alibi.

334
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,502
I said I have no idea.

335
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,715
Where were you on the night
of the 30th last month?

336
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,925
On Monday, my landlord said

337
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,261
the drain was clogged,
so I helped her unclog it.

338
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,013
Thank you.

339
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,683
Hello, we're from Dongbu Police Station.

340
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,462
We would have his prints in the system
if the culprit was an ex-convict,

341
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,006
but it doesn't show up.

342
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,971
You expect me to give it to you
for the chump change you gave me?

343
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,766
Detective,
you love freebies a little too much.

344
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,269
If you're curious, you must pay the price.

345
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:38,607
Nothing is free in this world, is it?

346
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,651
<i>I heard you visited Yang Yong-chul again</i>

347
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:44,112
<i>and even deposited cash
into his commissary account.</i>

348
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,198
Don't get cheeky.

349
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:47,949
I'm not acting cheeky.

350
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:52,913
Look at me. I ended up in here
trying to get some freebies.

351
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,960
Jeez, your words hurt.

352
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,462
Then you should go.

353
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:05,801
That a detective keeps visiting him

354
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,637
and asking him for advice!

355
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,433
Yang Yong-chul.

356
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,022
That's enough.

357
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:24,444
All I did was give an answer
to your question.

358
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,196
Only someone like me would do that.

359
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,658
If it had been other punks,
they would never say a word.

360
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,661
It'll expose all their methods.
They'd be insane to answer you.

361
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,580
Jeez, all right.

362
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,792
You must've grown on me
in that short while. What's with me?

363
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:42,170
Family Visitation Room.

364
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,884
I keep getting soft
because I see you in a place like…

365
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,428
Gosh, you're so hasty.

366
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:57,060
This is my final warning.
Don't step over the line.

367
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,897
You really don't know how I feel, do you?

368
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:04,401
This is for sure.

369
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,070
Once he gets a taste of this,

370
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,614
he'll never be able to quit.

371
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:13,743
If you don't catch him…

372
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,912
It'll happen again.

373
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,129
ERADICATE PETTY THUGS
THAT EAT AWAY OUR ECONOMY

374
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:27,132
You little punk! How dare you do this?

375
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,718
You broke into my home in broad daylight!

376
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:31,678
Darn it.

377
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:36,141
So when your girlfriend was asleep,

378
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,101
you caught him trying to break in, right?

379
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,686
-Yes.
-Okay, I understand.

380
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,897
This isn't the place to talk.

381
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,649
-There's a room for interrogation--
-No, I said this guy

382
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,610
had a knife in his pocket!

383
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,613
-What?
-If I hadn't shown up then,

384
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:54,034
my Young-sook and my unborn child
would've died in his hands!

385
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:57,037
Hey, this is attempted murder!

386
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,206
-Darn it.
-Excuse me, sir.

387
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,374
Please don't shout. Calm down.

388
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,043
Well, hey.

389
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,504
That thing in your pocket. Pull it out.

390
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,425
Pull it out.

391
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:14,596
I'm sorry.

392
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,140
-You jerk!
-Sir.

393
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:20,977
Calm down, sir. That's public property.

394
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,021
I can't see it, so lift it up.

395
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:24,940
Higher.

396
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,318
Scissors? Why do you carry that around?

397
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,570
I'm really sorry.

398
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,990
-What's the charge?
-Housebreaking.

399
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:37,535
It's attempted murder! He has a weapon!

400
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,622
Yes, sir, we get it.
So please stop shouting.

401
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,207
Your child will get scared.

402
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,292
Hey.

403
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,378
Take it as evidence.

404
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,171
Okay.

405
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,839
Grab a seat, please.

406
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:51,716
Put it in.

407
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,469
Hurry up and put it in.

408
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,187
-Name.
-Cho Kang-moo.

409
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,565
-Age.
-Eighteen years old.

410
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,234
Give me your ID.

411
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,278
I don't have one.
My birthday hasn't passed.

412
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:17,200
Gosh, you're still wet behind the ears.

413
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,576
How did you get in?

414
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,953
I just picked it open.

415
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:21,788
The details!

416
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:24,332
I used those scissors.

417
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,960
You should be studying
instead of doing that.

418
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:29,129
Who taught you to pick doors
by using scissors?

419
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,506
I just learned it from friends.

420
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:35,135
You have some wonderful friends.

421
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,303
What's with your hair?

422
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,014
Sorry?

423
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,515
Weren't you wearing a cap?

424
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:41,850
You have helmet hair.

425
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,268
Oh, yes.

426
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:46,855
Where's your cap?

427
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,692
-Sorry?
-Where's the cap you wore?

428
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,111
I lost it on the way here.

429
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,613
You're so clumsy.

430
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:56,740
Get up for a second.

431
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,498
-How tall are you?
-I'm 167cm.

432
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,627
Kids who say they're 167cm
are always 165cm.

433
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,129
No, I'm 167cm tall.

434
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:13,757
Then let's compare. I'm 175cm.

435
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,924
Let's compare.

436
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,885
Those who say that are barely over 170cm.

437
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,179
No, you jerk. I'm 175cm.

438
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,472
What are you doing?

439
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:21,931
Is this a blind date?

440
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,517
Sit down.

441
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,189
<i>As for his height…</i>

442
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,150
I'm not sure.

443
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:34,277
Anyway, he was pretty short like a girl.

444
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,241
His fingerprint identification
will come out tomorrow, right?

445
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,077
Sorry?

446
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,496
The scissor.
You just took it in as evidence.

447
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,623
-It's not--
-It should come out tomorrow.

448
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,792
Fingerprint analysis.

449
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,798
Right?

450
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:57,384
Yes.

451
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,095
It'll come out tomorrow.

452
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:04,682
What's your address?

453
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,685
Your address! You little…

454
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,785
Write down why and how you broke
into that house in detail.

455
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:25,870
I just thought…

456
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,873
no one was inside, so I went in.

457
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,418
Write it down.
And don't speak unless spoken to.

458
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,090
-Write as many details as you can.
-Okay.

459
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,973
Hey, when we were working
on Bang Ki-hoon's case…

460
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,433
Yes?

461
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,978
We had a statement from a witness
about Red Cap.

462
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,313
-Did she say the guy was short?
-Yes.

463
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,693
But I doubt that it's him.
He's still wet behind his ears.

464
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,196
Can you ask the victim

465
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,907
if he was wearing a cap
before he was brought in?

466
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,869
And check if there were any caps
thrown out on the way here.

467
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,291
Go.

468
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:13,960
Okay.

469
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,671
Hold on. Not yet.

470
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,261
This is Dongbu Police Station.

471
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:25,388
I'm going to register an item
under evidence.

472
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,806
Run a fingerprint test on it.

473
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,100
It's urgent.

474
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,686
Put a rush on it.

475
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,909
What you just did is a serious crime.

476
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,578
You were caught red-handed
picking the door with scissors.

477
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,497
That could have been a murder weapon.

478
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,540
They were just scissors.

479
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,960
You can kill people with scissors
because you can stab them.

480
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,838
How can you stab someone with scissors?
That's horrible.

481
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,301
-You think it's horrible?
-Yes.

482
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,928
Which part is horrible?

483
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:08,223
Stabbing someone or killing someone?

484
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,933
It's both, of course.

485
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,439
How many times have you broken in before?

486
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:19,526
This is my first time, of course.

487
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,945
You can climb walls too, right?

488
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:24,739
Thieves these days
can easily climb up three floors.

489
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:28,201
Is it because you're young?
You guys are so full of energy.

490
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,577
It's easy with the pipes.

491
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,208
You can climb pipes too?

492
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,961
Which floor did you break into before?

493
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,383
I know it wasn't your first time.

494
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,302
Even if you're a petty thief,
if you don't come clean now,

495
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,846
you'll end up with a heavier sentence.

496
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:50,515
So just come clean when you have a chance.

497
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,016
That's better for you.

498
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,435
It was on the first floor.

499
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:58,231
What about the second floor?

500
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,819
Do you remember which house it was?

501
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,030
You have to tell the truth
to get a lenient sentence.

502
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,913
It was just an ordinary house.

503
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,791
I guess no one was home
since you didn't get caught.

504
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,877
Yes. I don't break into houses
unless they are empty.

505
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,336
What if someone was there
when you broke in?

506
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:24,299
Then I would come out or hide.

507
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,342
You've never been caught other than today?

508
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,719
No.

509
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,854
Write everything down there.
All the houses you've broken into so far.

510
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,024
I'm going to.

511
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,652
But I'm getting confused
because you keep talking to me.

512
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,168
What the…

513
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,433
SUSPECT INFORMATION

514
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:17,727
GRANDMOTHER: PARK HYUN-JA

515
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,938
How long have you lived
with your grandmother?

516
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,024
Did you talk to my grandmother?

517
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,361
You're a minor.

518
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,571
It's our duty to call your guardian.

519
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,864
Right.

520
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,786
How long have you lived
with your grandmother?

521
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:36,829
Ever since I was ten.

522
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,998
-What about your parents?
-I don't talk to them.

523
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,583
-Both of them?
-Yes.

524
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,086
-Did they get a divorce?
-I'm not sure.

525
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,631
My mom ran away, and my dad abandoned us.

526
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,178
Is my grandmother here?

527
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,304
Why?

528
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,515
You don't want to worry her?

529
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,310
Fuck.

530
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,989
INTERROGATION ROOM

531
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,573
He didn't lose it.

532
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,954
He put it behind a telephone pole.

533
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,458
-Isn't this expensive?
-What?

534
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,335
Look at this brand.

535
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,004
Right. It's pretty expensive.

536
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,048
By the way, did you get anything from him?

537
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,760
He can't be the culprit
for Bang Ki-hoon's…

538
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,223
Can you run a fingerprint test
on the scissors he brought in?

539
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:40,143
Captain Park already requested it
to be expedited.

540
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,021
I see.

541
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,150
Let me borrow that.

542
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,402
-If it's not urgent, let me use it.
-What?

543
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:50,737
I just need it for a while.

544
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,256
Is this your cap?

545
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,596
It's yours, right?

546
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,890
It's expensive. Don't lose it.

547
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,600
Thank you.

548
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:24,103
-You must like caps.
-Yes.

549
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,773
Write a new one,
and number the houses you robbed.

550
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,608
The one you just wrote is number one.

551
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:29,984
The next one is number two.

552
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:38,326
DAEBONG-DONG 14-1

553
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,205
Then you must have
a lot of expensive caps.

554
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:44,749
I only have one. This is really expensive.

555
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:48,419
It's just you and your grandma.
You must need a bigger allowance.

556
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,670
I don't get an allowance.

557
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,883
I earn my own money.

558
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,430
-You must have a part-time job.
-Yes.

559
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,390
But you still robbed houses?

560
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,977
I guess you needed more money.

561
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:06,604
I was bored.

562
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,315
-You were bored?
-Yes.

563
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,859
I just did it a few times for fun.

564
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,529
Kids around my age
steal other people's stuff.

565
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,988
You've never done that?

566
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,034
I'll never do it again.

567
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,621
I'll promise that I'll never steal again,
so can I go home?

568
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:26,624
I'll promise I'll never do it again.
Can't you just send me home?

569
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:27,750
I can't.

570
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,710
I told you earlier.

571
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,797
-This could have been attempted murder.
-How…

572
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,306
How is this attempted murder?

573
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:46,018
I was just trying to steal some money.

574
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,314
Besides, I couldn't even steal anything
because I got caught.

575
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,400
When you break in with a weapon,
it's not a simple theft charge.

576
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,818
It's special larceny.

577
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,488
It's a serious criminal offense
that can put you away for ten years.

578
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,656
And also…

579
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,117
it wasn't your first time.

580
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:06,205
We need to know how much money you stole
and what you did with what you stole.

581
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:10,001
So write down when, where,
how you broke in, how much you stole,

582
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,004
and every single thing you stole.

583
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:14,630
I mean…

584
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,635
Isn't robbing empty houses better
than extorting money from other kids?

585
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,720
Is that what you think?

586
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:23,556
My neighborhood is full of those kids.
But you don't interrogate them like this.

587
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:27,059
Is that how
your grandmother will think too?

588
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,277
Write them down.

589
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,330
What part-time job do kids your age have?

590
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,873
Damn it.

591
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,043
Do you want me to write it or not?

592
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,086
Can I just plead the Fifth?

593
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,172
Your questions are annoying me.

594
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:01,135
Okay, you're free to do so.

595
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,263
But it could work to your disadvantage.

596
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:09,018
If our investigation reveals
that you're guilty of everything,

597
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,729
you may be subject
to a heavier punishment.

598
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:19,695
I've worked as a delivery boy.

599
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,826
We questioned all the delivery guys
who work in the area

600
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,536
but couldn't track him down.

601
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,415
And as a server.

602
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,966
Write down the numbers I say.

603
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,803
-Damn it.
-Two.

604
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:48,975
Twenty-two.

605
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,980
Twenty-three.

606
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,359
Two hundred thirty-three.

607
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,868
What are these numbers?

608
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,037
I'm sure you know what they are.

609
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:16,669
The number 2 at 214 Daebong-dong
means a woman lives there alone.

610
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:41,777
What is this?

611
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,446
Two means an adult female.

612
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:45,364
Three means a kid.

613
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,699
And the number one means…

614
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,161
an adult male.

615
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,374
What's wrong? Are you anxious?

616
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,835
What do you mean?

617
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,297
You were too meticulous

618
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,342
for someone who robbed houses
a few times "for fun."

619
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,112
You know them, don't you?

620
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,781
No, I don't.

621
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,616
We found a fingerprint at the scene.

622
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,577
Why do you keep telling me this?

623
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,580
We'll get the results
that prove it matches yours tomorrow.

624
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,133
Kang-moo.

625
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,639
Why did you undress them?

626
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,940
It's what that scumbag did all the time.

627
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:02,650
"That scumbag"?

628
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,364
My dad.

629
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:15,079
-Come here.
-Please save me. I'm sorry.

630
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:16,288
Darn it.

631
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,209
-I'm sorry.
-Get up.

632
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:23,295
Please forgive me.

633
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,974
-Darn it.
-I'm sorry.

634
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:41,188
Every time I saw her just putting up
with it, it made me so angry.

635
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,413
SERIAL RAPIST RED CAP'S WHEREABOUTS
STILL REMAIN UNKNOWN

636
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,097
Damn it.

637
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:24,833
When did you get here?

638
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,503
-You forgot to take an umbrella, right?
-How did you know?

639
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,255
The floor was wet, so I wiped it.

640
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:34,343
It's just a food stall.
Can't you just hang out with me today?

641
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,428
Look at you belittling me again.

642
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:50,776
Ki-hoon!

643
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:52,236
Seriously.

644
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,071
It's raining.

645
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,548
Are you sure you found it?

646
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,092
My fingerprint.

647
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,055
You lied to me, didn't you?

648
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,140
What do you mean?

649
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,476
I wiped everything I touched.

650
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,113
Which house did you find it in?

651
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,785
There is no such thing as a perfect crime.

652
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:27,873
And you'll find out tomorrow
whether or not I lied to you.

653
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:38,676
He confessed.

654
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,356
You little…

655
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,201
COURT ORDER

656
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:07,871
<i>Your retrial request has been denied.</i>

657
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,205
We got the results back.

658
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:51,790
The unidentified fingerprint

659
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,167
does belong to Cho Kang-moo.

660
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:56,128
It wasn't in the system
because he's a minor.

661
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,212
FINGERPRINT ANALYSIS REPORT

662
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:07,556
99.99 PERCENT MATCH

663
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:09,516
<i>This is the first news this morning.</i>

664
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,560
<i>A teen boy pretended to be Red Cap</i>

665
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:14,605
<i>to confuse the police
and committed murders.</i>

666
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:17,774
<i>The brutal details of his crimes
have now been revealed.</i>

667
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:20,360
<i>The suspect, Cho, used his image
as a diligent young man</i>

668
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,613
<i>-to go about his daily life</i>
-Hello?

669
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:25,240
<i>and escaped the police dragnet
as if nothing had happened</i>

670
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:27,409
<i>even after murdering
two women who lived alone.</i>

671
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,369
<i>Cho is an 18-year-old minor.</i>

672
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,455
<i>He does not have
a resident registration number yet,</i>

673
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:33,290
<i>so his fingerprints weren't registered
in the system,</i>

674
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:35,083
<i>which he used to his advantage.</i>

675
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,713
Why did you undress the victims?

676
00:46:39,796 --> 00:46:42,007
What will happen to Bang Ki-hoon,
who's in jail now?

677
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,884
-Why did you kill them?
-Did you kill anyone else?

678
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,345
-How many people did you kill?
-Did you copy Red Cap?

679
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:48,555
-Say something!
-Just a comment!

680
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:58,732
{\an8}-Bring her back you evil jerk!
-Get out of the way, please.

681
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:01,109
-You jerk!
-Bring her back!

682
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,819
Bring her back to life!

683
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:04,446
-Let me in!
-Stop it!

684
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,781
Let me in just once!

685
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:07,699
Settle down.

686
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,952
Bring her back to life!

687
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:13,247
You attacked the victim
who was in her room.

688
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:14,915
Then you strangled her.

689
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,292
You got on top of her.

690
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:22,798
And then you took her top off.
Is that right?

691
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:25,509
Right. You took her top off.

692
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:34,685
TWISTED DESIRES OF A TEENAGE BOY

693
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:38,522
{\an8}CHO TARGETED WOMEN LIVING ALONE
AND COMMITTED MURDER TWICE

694
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:41,900
<i>The victim's home was robbed
of 290 million won.</i>

695
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:42,985
<i>Afraid of retaliation…</i>

696
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:46,280
Everyone is so interested in crime cases.

697
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:49,449
Yet why is it so hard to catch criminals?

698
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:52,202
Anyway, good work.

699
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,836
It's a relief
that we ended up catching him.

700
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:05,048
If we didn't,
there may have been a third victim.

701
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,383
Do you think so?

702
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:08,468
I feel bad for the victims to say this,

703
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:12,180
but for a guy who committed
the same murder twice,

704
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,433
committing another one
would be nothing for him.

705
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:16,810
You're right.

706
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:18,520
He's still a kid.

707
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,526
Cho Kang-moo…

708
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,862
already showed boldness
in his second crime.

709
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,119
<i>He saw her house key on her</i>

710
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:36,038
<i>and suspected she lived alone.</i>

711
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:39,708
<i>He erased his traces
with the toilet paper from the bathroom.</i>

712
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,043
<i>When I checked again,</i>

713
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:46,340
<i>both victims' homes only had the core
of toilet paper rolls left behind.</i>

714
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,384
Why was I so stupid to not notice that?

715
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:53,347
You can't be perfect. We're human too.

716
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:56,600
It's our job to find
as many clues as we can.

717
00:48:58,727 --> 00:48:59,936
Which is why I'm saying

718
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,773
we need to do research
on criminal behavior analysis.

719
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:04,358
We have to find that out.

720
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:07,694
Also, it's not as if these guys stop
because they go to jail.

721
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:08,904
They don't.

722
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:11,365
It's important to catch them.

723
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:14,660
But we have to be prepared
for when they go back into society.

724
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:18,163
If we do research and make data
out of these similar criminal cases,

725
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:20,707
I'm certain it will come in handy.

726
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:25,545
Just like how you went to see
Yang Yong-chul to catch Cho Kang-moo.

727
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,051
How are things with Captain Park?

728
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:34,638
It was Captain Park who got
a confession out of Bang Ki-hoon.

729
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:37,557
Nothing will change.

730
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:39,851
That's a relief then.

731
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:42,646
I'll give you a ride.

732
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:45,065
No, it's fine.
I want to walk a bit. Go home.

733
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:47,150
-Get home safely.
-I will.

734
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:59,705
<i>I only call him like that
because I have no other option.</i>

735
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,665
He doesn't deserve to be called a father.

736
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,000
He sent his own child to an orphanage.

737
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:07,754
-It's what that scumbag did all the time.
-"That scumbag"?

738
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:09,798
My dad.

739
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:14,886
<i>Cho Kang-moo's unusual behavior
stemmed from his resentment and hatred</i>

740
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,596
<i>toward his parents.</i>

741
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,433
<i>He feels absolutely no remorse
for the murders he committed.</i>

742
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,059
<i>Which is why I'm saying</i>

743
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:23,770
<i>we need to do research
on criminal behavior analysis.</i>

744
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,105
<i>We have to find that out.</i>

745
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:32,612
Is there anything you would like to say
to the victim's family?

746
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:42,622
Look here!

747
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,416
How do you feel right now?

748
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:46,084
Do you have anything to say?

749
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:57,220

and an apology to Bang from the police

758
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:37,302
who beat him to get a false confession.

759
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:39,721
The people also strongly condemned

-That's not it.

We'll hold a press pool when it's time.

00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:14,858
You're Captain Park who investigated
Bang Ki-hoon's case, right?

786

I came to see Detective Song Ha-young.

789
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:27,412
I heard he got help from Yang Yong-chul,

790
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:30,874
also known as Red Cap, who's in prison
for Cho Kang-moo's case.

791
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:32,250
Is that true?

792
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:33,960
Nothing like that happened.

793
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,380
I just got back from meeting
Yang Yong-chul.

794
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:39,841
Darn it.

00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:43,094

Yes, of course.

00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:16,396
who we should really worry about.

825
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,194
I would do the same thing

826
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:25,655

SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

834
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:25,840
Ha-young was the one who caught
the real culprit, not Yang Yong-chul.

835
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,842
If it weren't for him,

836

That's what you think.

It's nothing wrong.

841
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:43,233
Rather, no one taught him,
but he thought of that alone.

842
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,610
I get it. But the thing is,

843
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:47,946
no one knows that out there.

844
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:50,448
If they don't know, we must let them know.

845
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:53,493
This is the perfect time to form
the Behavioral Analysis Team.

00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:56,371
Young-soo, please learn
to read the room, will you?

847
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:59,165
We're about to get dragged
to the commissioner's office.

848
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,543
That's great.
Go ask him to form that team.

849
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:03,670
Darn you. Good grief.

850
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,632
Please trust me this once.

851
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:14,347
It's the old man.

-The commissioner?
-Yes.

853
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,352
You go ask him to form you that team.

854
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:21,729
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

855
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:22,856
-Darn it.
-You got this.

856
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:23,940
-We'll be back.
-Okay.

857
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:27,777
<i>Not only did the police accuse
an innocent man as the culprit,</i>

858
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,779
<i>but they also arrested
Cho, an 18-year-old…</i>

859
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,366
What will you do about the public opinion?

860
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,034
If the Special Crime Squad

861
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,036
had taken the case and put an end to it,

862
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,788
this wouldn't have happened.

863
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,540
It wouldn't be good manners

864
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:44,210
for us to work on a culprit
caught by the Dongbu Police Station.

865
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:45,587
They're already going crazy

866
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,964
about how you locked up
an innocent man for a year.

867
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:51,009
Can we let them ridicule us
saying a convict caught the criminal?

868
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:53,636
I've had enough of this incompetence.

869
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,890
Who leaked the fact that he's Red Cap?

870
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:58,975
It's not that someone
leaked the information.

871
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:02,687
That jerk is putting on a show
to grab people's attention.

872
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:08,026
What have you done right as detectives?

873
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:09,110
-We'll do better.
-We're sorry.

874
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:11,196
Everyone at Dongbu Police Station
will be disciplined!

875
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:20,538
Simply disciplining them
won't solve anything.

876
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:23,208
What are you going to do about this?

877
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,250
I'm sorry.

878
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:29,547
-Darn it.
-Tell him.

879
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:31,549
Sorry?

880
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:34,677
-Tell him what?
-That thing.

881
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:37,305
-That thing?
-Pilot thing.

882
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:38,723
What are you two doing?

883
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:41,809
I'm sorry. He just whispered to me.

884
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:45,647
-I didn't get that. I'm sorry.
-That pilot thing.

885
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:49,192
Commissioner.

886
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:53,238
-There might be a way.
-Yes.

887
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,242
What is it?

888
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:58,660
I'll give you some more.

889
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:00,036
-Thank you.
-Sure.

890
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:01,746
Enjoy.

891
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:02,705
Hello.

892
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:10,713
One <i>ramyeon,</i> please.

893
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:30,483
-How much is it?
-Just go.

894
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,068
I don't take money from a friend.

895
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:40,910
Thank you for finding…

896
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:43,204
the real culprit.

897
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:52,463
You were always like that.

898
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:55,717
You pretended like
you didn't care about people,

899
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:58,803
but you always did behind their backs.

900
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:03,725
We'd like to pay the tab.

901
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,854
Sure. It's 8,000 won.

902
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:26,247
<i>Thank you for finding the real culprit.</i>

903
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,605
<i>If you're my friend, take it.</i>

904
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:05,453
You rascal.
Why didn't you come out sooner?

905
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:08,498
You weren't on a stakeout, were you?

906
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:11,334
Did you read the book
I gave you last time?

907
01:01:12,126 --> 01:01:15,838
I think we can finally form
the Behavioral Analysis Team

908
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:17,382
as long as you agree.

909
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:19,676
Sorry?

910
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:22,512
Do you remember
what I said about profilers?

911
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:24,472
If you hadn't caught Cho Kang-moo,

912
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:26,391
he would've continued to murder people.

913
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:28,309
We can stop that from happening.

914
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,895
We pretty much stopped Cho Kang-moo too.

915
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:33,523
-Can you explain in simple terms?
-Okay.

916
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:36,984
You can officially go around
interviewing inmates.

917
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:38,528
How is that possible?

918
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:40,905
You said it was helpful
to visit Yang Yong-chul.

919
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:44,575
We can just say it was the duty
of the Behavioral Analysis Team

920
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:46,077
to go interview Yang Yong-chul.

921
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:49,330
Those above will have an excuse
to calm the people down.

922
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:53,668
And for me, I'm thrilled
because I can finally do some real work.

923
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:55,461
It'll definitely help
in solving similar cases.

924
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:57,922
Honestly, this team
should've been formed long ago.

925
01:01:58,589 --> 01:02:00,133
But I don't exactly know…

926
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:03,428
what a profiler does.

927
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:05,763
It's all right. Just do as you've done.

928
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,725
Others couldn't understand,

929
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:11,978
but you instinctively knew
that this was necessary.

930
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:14,605
That's why you continued
to visit Yang Yong-chul.

931
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:15,982
And as for studying,

932
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:18,317
you and I can start doing that now.

933
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:23,281
I believe this was something

934
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:25,783
someone had to do someday.

935
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:27,910
And I'm certain…

936
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:31,122
that you're the perfect person
for this job.
