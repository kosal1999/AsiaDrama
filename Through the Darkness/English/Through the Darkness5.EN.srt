00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,040
<i>Right before the</i> Chuseok <i>holidays…</i>

2
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,417
I'm sorry I was late.
There was heavy traffic.

3
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,669
No, it's fine. I just came out too.

4
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:47,922
Hey, my cousin got married pretty late.

5
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,799
So everyone at the wedding cried.

6
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,177
And my mom packed me food from the buffet.

7
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,553
Look at all this food.

8
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:54,721
Goodness.

9
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:58,308
This sure makes us feel like
normal people, doesn't it?

10
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,435
I went to a wedding on a Saturday.

11
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:03,521
And we're stuck downtown
in the middle of a congested road.

12
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:06,066
It'd be perfect if only we weren't
headed to visit someone in prison.

13
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,151
<i>Seoul Tollgate announced
that cars leaving Seoul…</i>

14
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,737
Hey. How do office workers
wear ties every day?

15
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,363
This is so suffocating.

16
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,990
<i>And the Honam Expressway…</i>

17
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,534
Gosh. I should've brought
some clothes to change into.

18
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,662
Do you want to switch shoes at least?

19
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,914
No, it's okay.

20
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,583
-Do you want rice cakes?
-Sorry?

21
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,627
-Open your mouth.
-I'm good.

22
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,836
Open up.

23
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,923
There. Chew it.

24
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,841
That's it.

25
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,635
Let's go.

26
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,681
SEOUL DETENTION CENTER

27
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,934
Isn't it nice?

28
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,852
It does look big and nice.

29
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,980
I spent two months' salary on this.
It better be nice.

30
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,024
You're spending more than you're earning.

31
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,819
You need the right tools
to put your skills to use.

32
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,071
Hey, this kind of looks lame.

33
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:53,988
I'll put it away.

34
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,199
I'm comfortable with it. Let me use it.

35
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:57,951
-You want to?
-Yes.

36
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,702
-Okay, it's all yours.
-Okay.

37
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,538
All right. Hold on.

38
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,456
This should be…

39
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:07,293
Should we put this here?

40
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,380
{\an8}KEEP QUIET

41
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,132
Inmate 4709, you have visitors.

42
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,220
Who's here?

43
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,476
Look at him
dusting off his feet again. Gosh.

44
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,895
-That fool.
-Just go, will you?

45
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,564
-Jeez.
-Seriously.

46
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,192
Hurry up. The officer is waiting.

47
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,277
-Goodness.
-Come on.

48
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,361
Darn you.

49
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,947
-I'm sorry, man.
-What the…

50
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,699
You can't blindside me like this.

51
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,326
I can't even stand the way he walks.

52
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,100
All right.

53
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,728
We're not here to interrogate you,
so relax.

54
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,564
Did you dress up to see me?

55
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:12,692
Why do you ask?

56
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,654
I feel special.

57
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,123
Isn't it all over now?

58
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,751
Do you think it's over?

59
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,711
You caught me.

60
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:35,298
Mr. Cho, we still have
many questions for you.

61
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,300
But I told you everything last time.

62
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,011
I told that lady everything too.

63
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,430
She is a detective, not a "lady."

64
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,892
We want to hear more about you,

65
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,727
not about the case.

66
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,104
You could tell us about your childhood

67
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,732
or about what you usually feel.

68
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,658
It's just for our record,
so don't worry about it.

69
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,368
Right.

70
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,246
Well…

71
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,206
Is there anything you'd like to tell us?

72
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,918
It's okay. You can tell us anything.

73
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,795
You're not interrogating me,

74
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,463
but you want to hear my story?

75
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:17,548
Yes.

76
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,676
No one wants to hear my story.

77
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,845
-Why do you?
-We visited your place.

78
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,348
My place?

79
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,766
Yes, it was very clean.

80
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,768
Everything was neatly organized,

81
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,812
even your socks.

82
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,189
I don't like it when things are messy.

83
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:35,566
I know.

84
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,822
So you must be having a hard time here.

85
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,323
Right?

86
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,494
Every day, strangers who committed
heinous crimes

87
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:49,038
are eating and sleeping with you.

88
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,707
It must be awful.

89
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,335
It is awful.

90
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,587
So…

91
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,425
why don't you tell us more about yourself?

92
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:05,179
The people here
will try to treat you as one of them.

93
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,392
But in our eyes,

94
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,937
you seem a little different.

95
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,441
Well…

96
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,736
They don't even wash often.

97
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,740
They stink,
and the cell is small and filthy.

98
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,409
It's really driving me crazy.

99
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,661
Right, I'm sure.

100
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,621
So this was what we thought.

101
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,791
Perhaps you…

102
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,671
didn't actually intend to kill Soo-hyun--

103
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,965
That's right, I…

104
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,925
I never intended to kill her.

105
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,848
That's why we want to hear your story.

106
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:52,518
To understand why you're different
from the others.

107
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,196
Looks like you've lost some weight.

108
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,657
Have you been eating well?

109
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,580
Then why don't we

110
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,250
eat something first
before we start talking?

111
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,243
How are you feeling?

112
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,703
I got to have a proper meal for a change.

113
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,706
I wish every day was like today.

114
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,626
Do you regret it?

115
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,882
She shouldn't have been there.

116
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,262
What do you mean by
she shouldn't have been there?

117
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,640
Blame the girl's bad luck.

118
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,604
It's Soo-hyun.

119
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,982
Her name.

120
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,193
Lee Soo-hyun.

121
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,240
Had she not come to that place that day,

122
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,994
nothing would have happened to her or me.

123
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,123
Do you think…

124
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,210
this incident is her fault?

125
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,297
I'm saying it's her fault
for catching my attention.

126
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,574
<i>I wonder what was on his mind</i>

127
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,578
<i>as Cho Hyun-gil was watching
such an innocent child.</i>

128
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,331
<i>Why is he different from us?</i>

129
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,010
Are you from Samcheonpo?

130
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,429
I don't hear a dialect though.

131
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,391
I moved to Seoul when I was 15.

132
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,185
In eighth grade?

133
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,895
I didn't go to middle school.

134
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,023
I started working after elementary school.

135
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,149
What kind of work?

136
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,109
I worked at factories,

137
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:53,074
sold fish, and worked at butcher shops.

138
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,035
I did everything I was told to do.

139
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,620
I also had many jobs.

140
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,417
My family was very poor when I was young.

141
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,336
Since I'm the eldest son,

142
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,507
I had to help my parents on their farm
and sell our harvest.

143
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,259
I did all sorts of things.

144
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,136
Detective, what was your name again?

145
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,181
My name?

146
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,517
I'm Kook Young-soo.

147
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,354
Detective Kook, then did you also
quit school after elementary school?

148
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:28,526
I entered middle school
a year later than everyone else.

149
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:32,905
I see. At least you went to middle school.

150
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,283
You think you two are different?

151
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:36,951
What do you mean?

152
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,829
You were both poor,
and both of you struggled.

153
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,456
But he attended middle school,
so it's different.

154
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,420
I could've been different too.

155
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,922
You think that's why
you became a criminal?

156
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,508
Because you're a dropout?

157
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:02,935
Well…

158
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:05,730
I…

159
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,567
-Detective.
-Yes.

160
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,737
Can you get me a soda?

161
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,197
I have a habit of drinking one

162
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,782
after every meal.

163
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,006
<i>She shouldn't have been there.</i>

164
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,093
<i>Blame the girl's bad luck.</i>

165
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:48,749
Hey.

166
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,544
-Are you all right?
-Of course.

167
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,379
Let's go.

168
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,643
You quit smoking.

169
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,478
Yes, what's up?

170
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,105
Why do you carry a lighter around?

171
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,732
Oh, this thing?

172
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,110
For emergencies.

173
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:21,532
I'm sure there will come a day
when I'll crave a smoke.

174
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,286
If I don't have a lighter at that time,

175
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,832
I may seriously go crazy.

176
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,102
{\an8}PROPOSAL

177
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,270
{\an8}We just got started,

178
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,314
{\an8}so let us do this for just one more year.

179
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,773
{\an8}Go ahead.

180
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,400
We won't cause any trouble.

181
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,943
Right here. Please.

182
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,112
So please… Help me out.

must have been easy.</i>

186

-Arms down.

187
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,708
<i>They went up by as much as ten points.</i>

188
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,335

-Done.

189
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:15,961

Hey, let him go. Officer!

218
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,925
You can take him away.

219
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,303

00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,398
<i>My gosh, these detectives.</i>

224
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,817

00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:53,452
Eat up while you can.
A day like this may never come again.

236
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,287
Eat up. I'll do it.

237
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,248
It's fine. I'm an expert at grilling,
so I never let anyone else do it.

238
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:01,752
-Let me show you my skills. Give it to me.
-No, sir.

239
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,296
Just eat this. It's hot.

240
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,882
It's good.

241
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,717
Please evaluate my skills.

242
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,304
-I'll eat it myself.
-My gosh.

243
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,098
-You should eat too.
-Okay.

244
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,349
All right.

245
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,393

00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,769
Okay.

00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:21,313

No…

261
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,154
Honey!

262
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:11,613
Honey!

263
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,657
What's…

264
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,211
-There's another one.
-No, wait…

265
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,513
I WAS SO ANGRY

266
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,140
BECAUSE SHE DIED
BEFORE I COULD DO ANYTHING

267
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,578
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

268
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,001
So do you know who the new chief is?

269
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,212
Sorry?

270
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,214
Right.

271
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,466
What's wrong? What's with that face?

272
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,344
Oh, you're here.

273
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,263
Hey, good morning, Tae-gu.

274
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:19,765
Have you been well?

275
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,902
Why didn't you tell me?

276
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,322
You could've at least given me a heads-up.

277
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,116
Everyone already knew.

278
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,659
I didn't need to do that.

279
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,160
Everyone already knew.

280
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,412
Except for me,
who has to take orders from him.

281
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,040
I mean, I thought…

282
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,293
you already knew too.

283
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:52,464
Okay.

284
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,681
-Goodness, hello.
-Sir.

285
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,683
I'm Kim Bong-sik, the new chief
of the Special Crime Squad.

286
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,227
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

287
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,728
I hope we all get along.

288
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,772
-Yes.
-It's nice to meet you.

289
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,399
Let's grab some soju.

290
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,483
-Sure.
-Okay.

291
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,405
If you knew Kim Bong-sik
was coming as our new chief,

292
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,282
you of all people could've let me know.

293
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:23,370
I thought it would only bother you
if I told you ahead of time.

294
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,207
Also, nothing would change anyway.

295
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,959
Nothing could be changed,

296
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,670
so I should be kept in the dark?

297
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,922
No, that's not what I meant.

298
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,215
Well…

299
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,468
I'm sorry.

300
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,429
There's no need for you to apologize.

301
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:43,807
Forget it.

302
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,727
It probably wasn't easy for you either.

303
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,231
Does the Analysis Team know?

304
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,399
The Analysis Team?

305
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,696
Back when they were at Jungbu Station,

306
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:01,325
I heard Song Ha-young
once screwed over Chief Kim Bong-sik.

307
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,580
People in this field really love rumors,

308
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:08,957
don't they?

309
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,754
RAPE AND MUTILATION MURDERER
HWANG DAE-SUN

310
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,005
Why are you back?

311
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:18,508
We still do not understand

312
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,178
why you committed these crimes, Mr. Hwang.

313
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:26,016
So we came to hear
the story of your life, Mr. Hwang.

314
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,142
What story?

315
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,519
Well, can you share
stories of your childhood?

316
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,940
Why do you want to hear
my sad childhood story?

317
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,151
I guess you have lots of bad memories.

318
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,195
In that case,

319
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,739
can you tell me one thing
that made you the angriest?

320
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,536
It's my dad.

321
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,294
He always beat me up without a reason.

322
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,839
He'd beat me up during meals,
and beat me for going to school.

323
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,759
I sometimes took a few days off

324
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,177
because he hurt me so badly.

325
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,681
I was also stripped down to my underwear

326
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,891
and got kicked out of the house.

327
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,436
I stood by the front gate.

328
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,065
So if your neighborhood friends saw you,

329
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,318
they would've teased you a lot.

330
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,195
Kids made fun of me

331
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,406
until I went to middle school.

332
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,826
I'd beat them up too.

333
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,663
I never hung out with them.

334
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,915
Those emotions
must have been tough on you.

335
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,420
It's humiliating to be stripped.

336
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,382
How did you usually deal with your anger?

337
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,217
There wasn't much I could do as a kid.

338
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,512
All I could do was kill animals.

339
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,851
I killed my neighbor's cow with a sickle.

340
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:54,896
I caught a dog in my neighborhood
and watched it jump and bark

341
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,189
in hot, boiling water.

342
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,526
Watching that got me off.

343
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,988
My dad stripped me
and kicked me out so many times.

344
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,825
So I still hate it
when my body is exposed.

345
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,202
It infuriates me.

346
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:14,291
No matter how hot it is,
I never wear shorts or short sleeves.

347
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,959
After you killed animals,

348
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,712
did you dismember them too?

349
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:20,672
Sometimes.

350
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,591
I tried cutting them up.

351
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,260
I learned to cook at a restaurant.

352
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,388
Using a knife to cut them
into pieces was fun.

353
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,309
Your second female victim.

354
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,978
Is that why you cut off
the flesh on her leg

355
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,397
after you raped and murdered her?

356
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,275
I don't know.

357
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,862
I wanted to cut it off when she was alive.

358
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,866
But she kept moving,
and her blood splattered.

359
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,702
So I stopped for a bit.

360
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,163
After I killed her,

361
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,875
I sat next to her
and tried to cut it off again.

362
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,840
But I don't remember much
because I was drunk.

363
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,510
Then you took it home.

364
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,220
But no one saw you?

365
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:09,638
It was dripping in blood.

366
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,890
I bet it must've scared people.

367
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,685
Why? They wouldn't know what it was.

368
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,230
I thought it was meat for a second

369
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,649
when I woke up the next day.

370
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,903
You don't remember?

371
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,530
Or do you not want to talk to us?

372
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,117
It's both.

373
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:36,081
Do I have to tell you everything?

374
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,874
You said it wasn't an interrogation.

375
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:43,755
GWANGJU PRISON

376
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,757
-Have a good day.
-You too.

377
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:50,470
Hwang Dae-sun definitely shows
the behaviors of serial killers.

378
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:53,431
Right. But why do you think
he cut off the flesh on her leg?

379
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,100
It looks like he didn't know.

380
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:59,855
I think his rage
against his abusive father

381
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,482
developed into abnormal sexual behaviors.

382
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,610
Then his rage caused him
to mutilate the body too.

383
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:07,487
Right.

384
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:14,411
<i>Many organizations are trying
to support flood victims</i>

385
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:17,622
<i>from Typhoon Maemi which struck
the Korean Peninsula pretty hard.</i>

386
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,458
<i>The civil organizations…</i>

387
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,669
How may I help you?

388
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,303
Is this the Behavioral Analysis Team?

389
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,723
-Yes.
-Where's Song Ha-young?

390
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:38,935
Inspector Song? He's out for an interview.

391
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,604
"Inspector"?

392
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:43,190
Should I tell him you stopped by
when he comes back?

393
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,611
<i>SKY, WIND, STAR, AND POETRY</i>
BY YUN DONG-JU

394
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,279
He hasn't changed.

395
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,744
What brings you here?

396
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,163
Don't mind me.

397
00:24:58,663 --> 00:24:59,915
Get back to work.

398
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:11,426
It's like nothing ever happened.
This isn't fair.

399
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,304
Sorry?

400
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:15,972
The weather.

401
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,851
The weather being this nice isn't fair.

402
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,022
The pain and sense of loss.

403
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,274
The suffering

404
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:29,945
is only up to the victims to bear.

405
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,157
I bet some people are enjoying
this good weather.

406
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:49,297
All right.

407
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,633
He's not even investigating the case.

408
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:55,178
Why is he reading
the case reports for the detectives?

409
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,515
Seriously. This nosy jerk.

410
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,017
Hey. I'll tell him when he comes--

411
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,435
You punk!

412
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,438
"Hey"?

413
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,566
Read what it says on my business card.

414
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,281
"Special Crime Squad Chief, Kim Bong-sik."

415
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,740
Are you blind?

416
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,325
I'm sorry.

417
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,745
You seem to have picked up bad habits
from Song Ha-young.

418
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:23,039
You're still wet behind your ears.

419
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:26,251
This is
the Behavioral Analysis Team's office.

420
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,169
You need to tell me why you are here.

421
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,672
You are going to make me repeat myself.

422
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,674
You just mind your own business!

423
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,636
I'm back.

424
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,807
Assistant Inspector Song.

425
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,101
I hear you're an inspector now.

426
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,436
Inspector Song.

427
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,480
Goodness. You seem well.

428
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,399
What do you guys do here?

429
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:50,900
Why are you dressed up?

430
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,528
Why are you here?

431
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:55,864
I don't expect you
to give me a warm welcome.

432
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:59,784
But it's only polite to say hello
when you see someone.

433
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:00,702
Don't you agree?

434
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,121
Seriously.
This team is full of rude punks.

435
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,332
I'm Statistics Analyst Jung Woo-ju.

436
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,791
Statistics analyst?

437
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,586
You guys have difficult titles here.

438
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,880
Dumb people won't be able
to remember them.

439
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,340
What was it called?

440
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,385
Right. A profiler.

441
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,805
If you're here to talk to me,

442
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,015
let's talk outside.

443
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:25,477
I have nothing to say to you in private.

444
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,520
I just wanted to come to say hello.

445
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,732
And I wanted to check out
what you do here.

446
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,443
Why is the door open? Did…

447
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,987
It's been a while, Captain Kook.

448
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,574
I was transferred to
the Special Crime Squad.

449
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:43,328
We'll be seeing each other often.
I look forward to working with you.

450
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:46,373
-Okay.
-It was nice to see everyone.

451
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:50,835
Right. I bought this for you.

452
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,420
I almost forgot.

453
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,844
You still eat chocolates

454
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,679
like a little kid, right?

455
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,559
Even if we don't want to,
you'll see me every day.

456
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,770
Let's put our past behind us.

457
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,108
See you around.

458
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:20,990
Who was that?

459
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,952
Just as I heard, he's one rude cop.

460
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,750
I was wondering
how great his career was going

461
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:34,546
after he stabbed me,
his mentor, in the back.

462
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,757
You've got to be kidding me. An inspector?

463
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,569

<i>Find him now!</i>

467
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:37,567
I'm chasing a suspicious man
who fits the description.

468
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,652
I'm sorry. I lost him.

469
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,613

470
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,239
<i>Where are you?</i>

471
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,757
Let go of me, you bastard.

472
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,240
Darn it.

473
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,075
Jung Soo-chan.

474
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,910
You're under arrest

475
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,204
for robbery, murder, and fleeing.

476
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,791
You have the right to consult an attorney.

477
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,751
-And to remain silent.
-Get him!

478
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,172
Did you catch him?

479
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,134
Gosh. You really are a detective now.

480
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,177
Hey. We got him.

481
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,596
Don't stand there. Get him.

482
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,057
Yoon Tae-gu caught Jung Soo-chan.

483
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,227
Nice, Detective Yoon.

484
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:38,813
She got him.

485
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,609
This punk.

<i>You set an example</i>

a robbery and murder suspect

489
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:51,034

Inspector Yoon Tae-gu.

-You're amazing.
-Tae-gu, you rock.

00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,519
-Well done!
-Go, Yoon Tae-gu!

495
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:22,398
Oh, my. You really look like a cop now.

496
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,734
I thought she wouldn't last
and get married.

497
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:27,487
-Gosh. She looks great.
-You'll be the commissioner in no time.

498
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,072
-Tae-gu can definitely do that.
-Of course.

499
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,531
Could you take a photo of us?

500
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,492
-Sure.
-Can we join?

501
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,873
You got a special promotion
thanks to Ha-young.

502
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,751
I'm surprised
you're holding out well, Tae-gu.

503
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,633
Okay, let's try that one more time.

504
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,346
Nice. All right, smile.

505
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,349
Okay.

506
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,520
Captain.

507
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,398
-Captain Yoon.
-Yes?

508
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,608
Superintendent Baek wants to see you.

509
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,610
Superintendent Baek? Why?

510
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:08,695
I have no idea.

511
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:12,073
He asked for Chief Kim Bong-sik too,
but I don't know where he is.

512
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:13,866
Cheers.

513
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,786
It's nice to have you back.

514
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:23,126
Seeing you're the only one welcoming me,

515
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:26,879
I'm not sure whether
I've been doing well so far.

516
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:27,880
Come on.

517
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,842
I really meant it.
Do you have to twist my words like that?

518
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:33,553
What you need is my intel, not me.

519
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,263
That's what makes you indispensable.

520
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:38,558
Anyway, pretend not to know me
when you see me at the station.

521
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,685
Goodness. Don't worry.

522
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,771
Life is full of irony.

523
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,357
Song Ha-young and even Yoon Tae-gu.

524
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,192
Who knew I'd meet them again here?

525
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:51,112
Is this fate or something?

526
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,740
Did you meet Inspector Song Ha-young?

527
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:55,950
I did.

528
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,244
I can't figure out what his team does.

529
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:01,205
When you stab someone in the back,
it all comes back--

530
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,043
Darn it. There's one exception.

531
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,128
Who? You?

532
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,088
You little…

533
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:13,176
The head prosecutor

534
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,261
who asked for Yoon Tae-gu back then.

00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,304

00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,350
It's classified information,
so don't reveal your source.

538
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,810
Investigate it alone, quietly.

539
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,355
-This is credible, right?
-Have I ever lied to you?

540
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,275
Go through it. There's solid evidence too.

541
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,947
Why did I miss all this?

542
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,825
Yoon Tae-gu
is one of your direct reports, right?

543
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:38,868
Yes, sir.

544
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,580
-Hello.
-Where is Room 10?

545
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:45,374
It's this way.
You'll find it on your left.

546
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,001
<i>Yoon Tae-gu.</i>

547
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,669
<i>I mean, Detective Yoon.</i>

548
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:52,173
<i>We're now getting the hang
of working together as a team,</i>

549
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:55,093
<i>and you worked hard on this case,
so I want to buy you a drink.</i>

550
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,344
<i>Come meet me here.</i>

551
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,806
-I'm telling you.
-My goodness.

552
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,975
There she is. Come on in.

553
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,519
You made it. Take a seat.

554
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,229
Come on. Take a seat.

555
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,231
Come on!

556
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,399
Hey, where are you going?

557
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,026
<i>"Schmoozing"?</i>

558
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:16,155
-Goodness, the station is a hot mess.
-<i>How dare you disgrace the police force?</i>

559
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,282
-Detective Yoon, you're something.
-Are you satisfied?

560
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:22,703
<i>The head prosecutor</i>

561
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,580
<i>who asked for Yoon Tae-gu back then?</i>

562
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,998
I ended up taking bribes

563
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,668
from a building contractor
against my will.

564
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,337
And arrested a fake suspect.

565
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,297
Due to that, I was branded a corrupt cop.

566
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,967
Everything was set up
so he'd look like the real culprit.

567
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,218
Anyone would've been tricked.

568
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,887
Song Ha-young didn't!

569
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,931
That punk really gets on my nerves.

570
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:44,559
He has to get in the way
of everything I do.

571
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,144
I got demoted because of him!

572
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,729
But you're back now.

573
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,482
Song Ha-young was branded

574
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:54,110
a backstabbing troublemaker
who betrays his superiors.

575
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:57,822
That's why he's working
in that dump of an office now.

576
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,240
That's not enough.

577
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,494
He acts like a gentleman to your face
but skims the cream off the top

578
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:04,745
behind your back.

579
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,415
-Everyone needs to know that.
-Bong-sik.

580
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:11,377
I'll only trust Chief Kim Bong-sik,
who's back in Seoul now.

581
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,753
Why would you trust me?

582
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,005
Don't trust anyone.

583
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:16,716
Goodness, you're hurting my feelings.

584
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:19,886
-You don't even trust me?
-You little…

585
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:23,848
By the way,

586
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,766
the Suseong-dong case in Gangnam.

587
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,060
Who is the victim?

588
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,646
Those at Gangnam Police Station
are keeping it quiet.

589
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,732
Hey, today is my first day.

590
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:34,901
You must've heard something.

591
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,987
Can I please eat first?

592
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,618
Captain Yoon, you're here.

593
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:46,621
-I heard you asked for me.
-What? You came alone?

594
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,914
Bong-sik isn't at his desk?

595
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,541
We must be ready to mobilize at all times.

596
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,835
But he can't be reached on his first day?

597
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:53,878
Darn it.

598
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:56,672
We need you to take on a case.

599
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:00,468
The victim is Han Seok-hoon
a professor at Hankuk University.

600
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:04,180
He and his wife were murdered
in their home two weeks ago.

601
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:06,682
MURDER OF ELDERLY COUPLE IN SUSEONG-DONG
CASE REPORT

602
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,559
We need you to work on it.

603
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,187
It belongs to Gangnam Station.

604
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,689
It does fall under their jurisdiction,

605
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,443
but he's related to someone
who is very high up.

606
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:20,321
I was asked to look into it quietly,
so that's all I know.

607
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,406
But I think
they're struggling to find leads.

608
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,242
How do I find a phone number?

609
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:28,621
I think the reporters
already caught a whiff of it.

610
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,414
The higher-ups want us

611
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,833
to prevent media coverage
and work on it swiftly.

612
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,586
Gangnam Police Station will help you out.

613
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,588
Okay.

614
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,966
-I'll be off, then.
-Okay.

615
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,467
There, I found it.

616
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,220
Look at this.

617
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,764
This bastard, Kim Bong-sik.
He's not picking up.

618
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,516
Is it an important case?

619
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,559
All homicide cases are equally important.

620
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:51,686
That's true.

621
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:54,188
Why are we working on
another station's case?

622
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,815
We should go there first.

623
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,818
-Chief Kim still isn't at his desk?
-No.

624
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,237
People really don't change.

625
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,738
{\an8}SEPTEMBER 29, 2003

626
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,657
{\an8}Are we leaving now? Just the two of us?

Damn it, Im Moo-sik that scumbag…

630
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,615
{\an8}MURDER OF ELDERLY COUPLE IN SUSEONG-DONG
CASE REPORT

631
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,535
<i>The victims of the murder are a couple
in their sixties in Suseong-dong.</i>

632
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:32,661
<i>Han Seok-hoon,</i>

633
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,164
<i>a Hankuk University professor,
and his wife.</i>

634
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,088
I bet there's something
about Han Seok-hoon.

635
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,506
Gosh, seriously.

636
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,675
I told you not to say the victim's name.

637
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:50,388
Come on. You need to give me
something to write about.

638
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,139
Loyalty isn't a one-way street.

639
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:56,185
They've been preserving the scene
for over two weeks now.

640
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:59,230
There's definitely something.

641
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:01,732
You're really telling me nothing?

642
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:04,944
Over here.

643
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:10,116
Good day. I'm Yoon Tae-gu from Seoul HQ.

644
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,951
-This is…
-Nam Il-young, also from HQ.

645
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,661
Yes, I got a call. This way.

646
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,329
-Okay.
-Hey, tidy up here.

647
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:46,068
<i>There was cash lying around,
but he didn't even touch it.</i>

648
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:51,282
<i>They think it's an act of resentment
masked as a burglary.</i>

649
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,289
It's clean.

650
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,419
The victims were overpowered

651
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:07,965
without any sort of resistance.

652
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:09,341
If they had resisted,

653
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:13,304
blood would've splattered to the ceiling
as he was swinging his weapon.

654
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:16,015
You'll see that
the victims' bodies are clean

655
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:19,143
with no sign of defense
when you get to the morgue later.

656
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,980
Gosh, I don't know
what this horrifying guy hit them with.

657
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:25,983
We're trying our best
but weren't able to identify it yet.

658
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,693
He came into a rich house like this

659
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:30,237
and only pretended to look for cash.

660
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,072
It has to be a grudge.

661
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:35,117
We looked into that,
but that seems highly unlikely.

662
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:38,162
Both husband and wife
had great reputations.

663
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,290
They were high up the social ladder.

664
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:44,418
So they may have incurred a grudge
from someone without knowing.

665
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,213
So it may be the doings
of an acquaintance holding a grudge?

666
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,174
Should we start around the school?

667
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:51,634
We already did.

668
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,845
Even if it's an act of resentment,

669
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,933
his method is too bold and violent.

670
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,184
Overkilling is common

671
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:02,436
among murderers targeting acquaintances.

672
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,063
I doubt that a mentally ill person

673
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:06,148
would've casually walked into
a house like this.

674
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:10,402
Could you give us
the list of acquaintances you interviewed?

675
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:11,445
Yes, I will.

676
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:14,740
Once you get the list,
check to see if there's anyone

677
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,575
with a record and mental illness.

678
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:17,910
Yes, ma'am.

679
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:20,871
Why did a detective from Seoul HQ
come to a case in Gangnam?

680
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,711
Yes, sir?

681
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:30,464
Hey! Didn't I tell you
to release it first?

682
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:33,759
An article has been released
identifying the Suseong-dong victim

683
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,094
as Professor Han Seok-hoon!

684
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:36,220
What?

685
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:38,055
<i>You try to be respectful,</i>

686
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:39,682
conscientious, and even loyal.

687
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:42,601
So when do you plan on
getting an exclusive?

688
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,061
Who wrote that article?

689
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,855
Who do you think?
It's Im Moo-sik, of course.

690
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:49,358
Damn! That son of a bitch.

691
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,319
Let's hurry on over.

00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:57,825

Having us waste our time
by giving us useless things to do.

699
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:32,276
The things these higher-ups
come up with from their heads…

700
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:34,069
What about our heads?

701
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,657
I mean it's always so useful.

702
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,701
What's with this report?
You didn't even try.

703
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:41,702
Be more descriptive.

704
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:44,079
MURDER OF ELDERLY COUPLE
IN SUSEONG-DONG

705
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,165
Did you talk to Captain Yoon?

706
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:48,459
I'm sure she's doing just fine.

707
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:51,462
It's best for superiors
to just stand back and do nothing.

708
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:52,755
Are you talking about me?

709
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:55,257
Gosh, of course not.

710
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,721
Some punk must have leaked the case.

711
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,598
The reporters are already on it.

712
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:05,851
Those damn reporters. They sure are fast.

713
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:09,355
Seriously?

714
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,027
They're coming!

715
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,696
Still no leads in Han Seok-hoon's case?

716
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,739
Out of resentment?

717
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:20,866
Are you done interviewing?

718
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:23,285
-Do you have a suspect?
-Were any valuables stolen?

719
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,828
Is it an acquaintance's doing?

720
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:25,913
Answer us, please!

721
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,875
HWANG DAE-SUN
SECOND INTERVIEW REPORT

722
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:33,128
<i>What was the purpose
of carving out the flesh</i>

723
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,463
<i>after the victim's death?</i>

724
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:37,257
It looks like
you'll have homework tonight.

725
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,259
Still thinking about Hwang Dae-sun?

726
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:40,844
You know me.

727
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:42,805
Let's start.

728
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:46,058
Serial murders can be defined
by these three things.

729
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,101
A psychological cooling-off period.

730
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,728
Crime against a stranger to commit murder.

731
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:53,399
Murdering three or more people,
in three or more locations.

732
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,109
Out of all the prisoners we've met,

733
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,903
Hwang Dae-sun is closest

734
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:01,031
to the serial killer category
we are researching.

735
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,741
He did kill three people,

736
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,535
But he killed them

737
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:07,287
in two different cases.
He killed one out of impulse.

738
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,289
He may have planned the murder,

739
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,166
but it wasn't part of his initial plan.

740
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,420
I see two were raped and then murdered,
and the other was a man.

741
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,839
He had been drinking
when committing both cases.

742
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:21,844
The man was the second victim's boyfriend.

743
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:24,263
Then the boyfriend was murdered
out of impulse?

744
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:25,264
Exactly.

745
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:29,309
On his way to his girlfriend's house,
he witnessed the rape

746
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:30,727
and was murdered.

747
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:33,480
All three victims were murdered
under the influence.

748
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:35,315
So it's an unsystematic crime.

749
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:37,693
Just because he was under the influence

750
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:39,862
doesn't mean that
it was an unsystematic crime.

751
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:41,238
An unsystematic crime

752
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:43,657
is when confused behavior is shown
during the crime.

753
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:47,286
In the case of Hwang Dae-sun,
we can interpret his acts of

754
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:50,289
binding and carving out the skin
as abnormal sexual behaviors.

755
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:51,790
So it doesn't add up perfectly.

756
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:54,751
If you look at it according to
the FBI's categories of crime,

757
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,421
a systematic type is someone
who has personality issues.

758
00:45:57,504 --> 00:45:58,505
An unsystematic type

759
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,799
is someone delusional or schizophrenic.

760
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:03,302
With that in mind, Hwang Dae-sun

761
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:06,430
isn't someone who has a mental illness

762
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,391
but a systematic type
with a personality disorder.

763
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:11,768
This is difficult.

764
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:14,271
In the case of Dae-sun,
he showed systematic behavior

765
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,773
in how he searched
and dealt with victims using tools.

766
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,901
I understand when you tell me.

767
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:21,278
But the process of reasoning
is always difficult.

768
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:22,738
All right then.

769
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:25,991
I think the reason
Hwang Dae-sun's case is a serial one

770
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:30,162
is this one. Killing more than three.

771
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:31,246
Okay.

772
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:34,583
But I think it's more accurate
to label it as a rape and murder case

773
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:35,709
with continuity.

774
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,170
Since he had a sexual purpose to it.

775
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:41,590
Right, but there was
a bigger chance of him becoming

776
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:43,634
a serial killer if he hadn't been caught.

777
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:46,678
I was shocked when I heard
he'd killed animals as a kid.

778
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:49,806
It's a classic feature
that serial killers have.

779
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,809
But he didn't have a cooling-off period.

780
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:55,812
A PSYCHOLOGICAL COOLING-OFF PERIOD

781
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,731
<i>The culprit behind the Suseong-dong</i>

782
00:46:57,814 --> 00:47:00,317
<i>murder case of the old couple
in their sixties</i>

783
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,237
<i>in Gangnam on the 10th
has yet to be caught.</i>

784
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,240
<i>People are shocked
after the victim was identified</i>

785
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:09,409
<i>as Hankuk University's
Professor Han Seok-hoon and his wife.</i>

786
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:14,206
<i>Not only did Professor Han
teach economics at the university,</i>

787
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:17,584
<i>but he also appeared on TV often
to give his economical insights.</i>

788
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:21,088
<i>His bold attitude led to his popularity.</i>

789
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,715
<i>But does there always have to be
a cooling-off period?</i>

790
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:25,759
Serial killers feel

791
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:28,345
the highest form of pleasure
in the pure act of killing.

792
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:31,640
Once the pleasure ends,
they search for a new victim.

793
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:33,976
To put it simply, a cooling-off period

794
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:36,603
is a period where their sense
of satisfaction

795
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,313
from the murder continues to last.

796
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,566
Once that psychological satisfaction
comes to an end,

797
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,442
they'll move on to the next murder.

798
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:43,986
Then what about Hwang Dae-sun?

799
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,487
In the case of Hwang Dae-sun,

800
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,906
we can't view those periods
as a cooling-off period

801
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,200
since he was under the influence
during all the crimes.

802
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,620
But the fact that they murder again
once the period ends

803
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,831
is so horrifying.

804
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:57,207
Thankfully, in Korea,

805
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:59,418
there haven't been any murder cases

806
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:02,170
with the purpose of murder
and a cooling-off period.

807
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,256
It's all just speculation.

808
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,884
These guys are the reason you said
you'd need ten years, right?

809
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:25,819
You said you didn't find

810
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:28,030
any injuries on the back of them, right?

811
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:29,615
Right, I didn't find any.

812
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:37,247
It looks clean, right?

813
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:50,761
Drop me off at the office, please.

814
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:51,887
You're not going home?

815
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:55,057
No, I want to organize my thoughts.

816
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:58,101
You can head home first. Good job today.

817
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,729
No, I want to stop by
Gangnam Police Station.

818
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:03,899
I heard it's a mess over there right now.

819
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:06,193
SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS TEAM

820
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:09,404
Which team was Gangnam's
Professor Han case handed over to?

821
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:10,739
Special Crime Squad's Team Two.

822
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:16,953
Hello?

823
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:18,372
Yes.

824
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:20,791
Footprints?

825
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:24,378
Yes, all right. I'll get back to you.

826
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:26,755
It's Jongno Police Station.

827
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:29,383
The Gungok-dong case
they sent in last week…

828
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,218
They want us to run footprints

829
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:32,928
and other evidence
via the ex-convict database.

830
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:34,763
-Shall I bring them over?
-Yes.

-Thanks.

833
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:49,611
What?

834
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:54,741
What is it?

835
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:57,244
Don't these look similar?

836
00:49:58,453 --> 00:49:59,621
I think they do.

837
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,005
You finally managed to finish the report.

838
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,091
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

You can head home.

842
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,098
I'm behind on a lot of work
because of this report.

843
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,934
My gosh, you're unbelievable.

844
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:23,937
What's the word for this? Workahill?

845
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,564
-It's "holic."
-A workaholic.

846
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,609
I'll get going.

847
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,945
Chu Chu,
how about a glass of soju and beer?

848
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:33,613
Sounds great!

849
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,323
-Good luck.
-All right. Bye.

850
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:36,825
-Bye!
-Bye.

<i>committed according to a plan.</i>

860
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,739

00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:30,457
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

884
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:33,209
Coming to work now?

885
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:36,504
Yes.

886
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:39,090
What happened
at the crime scene yesterday?

887
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:41,509
I thought you weren't interested.

888
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:44,387
Are you actually curious?
I'll tell you once we're inside.

889
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:46,890
You got a lot bolder, Tae-gu.

890
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:49,225
You still have that feisty charm.

891
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:52,479
I do not want
your evaluation of my charms.

892
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,564
I hope we can just carry out our duties

893
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:57,275
without getting in each other's way.

894
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:01,196
You know how important teamwork is
when it comes to violent crimes.

895
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,906
How can you only do your duty?

896
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,283
Tae-gu,

897
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,243
do you still have a grudge against me?

898
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:11,790
A grudge?

899
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,585
You're quite delusional.

900
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:19,506
I do not have anything against you.

901
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:23,718
I'm sorry about that.

902
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,887
But everyone already knows

903
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,681
that I'm the bastard.

904
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:28,723
Right?

905
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:30,058
I was also aware of

906
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:31,726
how you were a bastard too.

907
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:32,852
Isn't that so?

908
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:35,772
Let's go inside.

909
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:38,608
I should not stop the ace
of the Special Crime Squad.

910
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:39,693
Shall I, then?

911
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:46,491
Gosh, heartburn.

912
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:47,177
You still think you can do this job
by keeping loyalty

913
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,054
even after spending three years here?

914
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:50,680
What should I do with you?

915
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:53,683
You know how strict
Detectives Kang and Park are.

916
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,185
I'm sure Moo-sik

917
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:57,187
won't get any information
from them anymore.

918
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:59,355
Detective Park isn't
the only detective there.

919
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,733
If anyone leaks intel to Daehan Daily,

920
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:03,526
it all turns into Moo-sik's article,

921
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,196
while you're sitting around
depending on Detective Park.

922
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:07,614
Moo-sik

923
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,866
even steals articles from juniors?

924
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:11,659
Man, talk about lack of conscience.

925
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,995
Yes, conscience.

926
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,705
That won't put food on the table.

927
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:19,334
I've been running around a lot
trying not to starve to death.

928
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:21,586
Sure. You work so hard.

929
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:23,213
You're commendable, aren't you?

930
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:25,840
My boss is doing a great job
at making me slave away.

931
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,008
Forget it.

932
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:29,719
Go out and find an item
that is as good a story

933
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:31,221
as the one you got stolen.

934
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:34,099
What do you mean? It wasn't ours anyway.

935
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:38,311
It's Detective Park.

936
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,690
Another case
at Gangnam Police Station broke out.

937
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,484
-Again?
-Yes.

938
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:47,654
Hey, Reporter Choi, keep it up. Run!

939
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:50,406
Forget all about
your conscience and loyalty!

940
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,867
Reporter Choi, get us just one good story!

941
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:55,829
Keep up the good work, then.

942
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,838
Man, I like how big this office is.

943
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:11,511
Are you satisfied with
your first order on the job?

944
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:14,222
Captain Kook put a lot of effort
into making those.

945
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:15,807
If it just sits there,

946
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:18,726
think how awkward he'll feel.

947
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:23,481
So what will they do
with all that information?

948
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:25,150
No idea.

949
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:27,152
He'll use it as his pillow or something.

950
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:29,154
I'm sure Captain Kook

951
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:32,407
will make good use of everything.

952
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:43,626
Make sure you check
and take everything as needed!

953
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:44,961
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

954
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:46,880
-In-tak.
-Hey, Young-soo.

955
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:48,923
Is something going on?

956
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:51,593
Gangnam Station needed backup.
We're heading to Jinjung-dong.

957
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:53,261
What about you?

958
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:54,888
I have to check some footprints.

959
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,431
I see. Keep it up.

960
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:58,391
-Okay.
-Wait.

961
00:57:58,475 --> 00:57:59,476
To your office, right?

962
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,728
-I'm fine. Get back to work.
-I'll go with you.

963
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:04,022
Hey, I'm still going strong.

964
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:05,106
Just get back to work.

965
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,566
-Seriously?
-Bye.

966
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:08,526
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

967
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:11,196
If you get stuck,
feel free to bring it to us.

968
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:14,491
-Bye.
-Be careful!

969
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:33,134
-Yes, there.
-<i>Newsflash.</i>

970
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:35,053
<i>This afternoon in Jinjung-dong, Gangnam,</i>

971
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:39,098
<i>a woman in her fifties was found dead
after being struck by a blunt weapon.</i>

972
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,768
<i>The police were dispatched
for an investigation</i>

973
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,728
<i>after a report made by Lee, the maid,</i>

974
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:45,688
<i>who saw the collapsed victim in her home.</i>

975
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,985
<i>Gangnam Police Station said
the culprit of today's</i>

976
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:53,321
<i>Jinjung-dong
and the Suseong-dong incident are…</i>

977
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:57,033
Chief Heo, what on earth is going on?

978
00:58:57,116 --> 00:59:00,036
I told you to investigate this quietly.
Why is it blowing up?

979
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:02,914
Captain Yoon and Detective Nam
are at the scene right now.

980
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:05,959
-Let's hear from them once they return.
-Good grief.

981
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:07,585
Where's Kim Bong-sik?

982
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:09,337
No idea. But he'll crawl back

983
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,631
if he thinks this will affect
his performance.

984
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:12,966
That's his deal.

985
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:15,510
Look at how big this case has become.

986
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,846
We might end up taking over

987
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,598
both of these cases.

988
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:21,891
Tell me about it.

989
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:25,311
These reporters already began to say
that they're related or something.

990
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:27,981
I have a bad feeling about this.

991
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,649
We can't let this happen.

992
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:32,318
Okay. Who is it?

993
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:35,154
Excuse me.

994
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:36,906
Hey.

995
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,032
-Hello.
-Hello.

996
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:39,117
What brings you here?

997
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,994
I found something weird.

998
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:43,246
-I wanted your opinion on this.
-What is it?

999
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:49,335
-Both are hiking shoes.
-Yes.

1000
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,378
What about them?

1001
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:52,964
This one is from Suseong-dong, Gangnam.

1002
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:55,216
And this one is from Gungok-dong, Jongno.

1003
00:59:58,761 --> 00:59:59,929
They match, right?

1004
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:05,351
They're from different areas
but the same culprit?

1005
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,316
A LUXURIOUS RESIDENTIAL HOUSE
IN GUNGOK-DONG

1006
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:17,572
My mom cooked breakfast for me.
I ate it and went to work.

1007
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:20,033
When I called, she didn't answer.

1008
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:22,493
So I came home and…

1009
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:26,039
Did anyone hold grudges against her?

1010
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:28,166
Or did she have any money problems?

1011
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:30,251
None.

1012
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:33,463
Did she ever sound upset on the phone?

1013
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:34,422
No.

1014
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:35,757
Hey.

1015
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:42,680
What?
There was another case in Jinjung-dong.

1016
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:44,223
-What?
-Look at this.

1017
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:45,224
I'm reading it now.

1018
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:48,061
"A woman living in her fifties
in Jinjung-dong was found dead

1019
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:49,896
from blunt force trauma."

1020
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:53,441
UNIDENTIFIED BLUNT WEAPON

1021
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:56,110
-So was the victim in Gungok-dong.
-Right?

1022
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:57,528
I'll check out the scene.

1023
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,740
I'm going to the Special Crime Squad.

1024
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:03,743
As the media says,
this case has similarities

1025
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,036
to Professor Han's case.

1026
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:07,872
What? Then it wasn't a revenge killing?

1027
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:09,707
We'll have to investigate more,

1028
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:13,252
but we don't have any suspects
in Professor Han's case.

1029
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:16,172
They both died

1030
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:18,174
from blunt force trauma to the head.

1031
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:19,884
And it was staged as a robbery?

1032
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:21,969
Yes.

1033
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:24,722
Gil-pyo. Chief.

1034
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,349
Hey, we're busy. Come back later.

1035
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:28,142
-Check this out now.
-Come back later.

1036
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:29,644
Just look at this.

1037
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,687
Hiking shoes.

1038
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:31,896
What about them?

1039
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:33,189
In-tak brought them to me.

1040
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:36,192
The first is from Suseong-dong.
The second is from Gungok-dong.

1041
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:38,695
Suseong-dong is in Gangnam.
Gungok-dong is in Jongno.

1042
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,280
-Give me that.
-It's the same guy.

1043
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,408
I read the reports. It's the same MO.

1044
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:47,829
-Blunt force trauma?
-Yes. Exactly.

1045
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:50,289
Suseong-dong and Gungok-dong.
They were hit in the head.

1046
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,291
The victim in Jinjung-dong
also died from--

1047
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:56,629
You knew?

1048
01:01:58,423 --> 01:01:59,590
I just got back

1049
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:02,844
from the crime scene in Jinjung-dong.

1050
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:06,806
Who on earth is this guy?

1051
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:08,683
The MO is the same.

1052
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:41,924
Why are you here?

1053
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:43,551
Let me in.

1054
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:46,637
You're not an investigator. Why?

1055
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:49,098
-I need to see the crime scene.
-Leave!

1056
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:51,851
Don't try to steal my case. Get lost!

1057
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:54,061
Please. I must check the crime scene.

1058
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:55,772
Hey. Didn't you hear me?

1059
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:57,648
I told you to get lost, you bastard!

1060
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:58,941
Damn it.

1061
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:01,527
This is important.

1062
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:26,385
<i>The victim was hit by a blunt weapon.</i>

1063
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:28,805
{\an8}UNIDENTIFIED BLUNT WEAPON

1064
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:40,441
<i>There are no footsteps in the bedroom.</i>

1065
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:42,735
<i>And the safe wasn't touched either.</i>

1066
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:47,406
CRIME SCENE STEPPING PLATES

1067
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:15,518
<i>There's no trace of blood
splattered on the ceiling.</i>

1068
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,061
<i>It means…</i>

1069
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:22,149
<i>the culprit subdued the victim
with one blow.</i>

1070
01:04:29,782 --> 01:04:31,951
-Yes.
<i>-Are you there?</i>

1071
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:38,040
What do we do?

1072
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:44,130
I thought we had ten years.

1073
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:47,341
But it happened too quickly.

1074
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:51,804
This killer checks all the boxes.

1075
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:56,142
{\an8}1. A PSYCHOLOGICAL COOLING-OFF PERIOD

1076
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:57,310
{\an8}2. CRIME AGAINST A STRANGER
TO COMMIT MURDER

1077
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:58,769
{\an8}3. MURDERING THREE OR MORE PEOPLE
IN THREE OR MORE LOCATIONS

1078
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:12,408
<i>The police admitted the recent killings
in wealthy neighborhoods</i>

1079
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:14,410
<i>could have been part of a serial killing.</i>

1080
01:05:14,493 --> 01:05:17,997
<i>The police will consider
the three murder cases</i>

1081
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,207
<i>in Gangnam and Jongno
as serial murder cases</i>

1082
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:22,001
<i>and do their best to find the culprit</i>

1083
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:24,879
<i>by dispatching more resources
to these areas.</i>

1084
01:05:24,962 --> 01:05:28,132
<i>There have been murder cases
in Suseong-dong and Jinjung-dong,</i>

1085
01:05:28,215 --> 01:05:29,425
<i>back to back.</i>

1086
01:05:29,508 --> 01:05:31,886
<i>And between these two cases,
a similar murder case</i>

1087
01:05:31,969 --> 01:05:34,263
<i>took place in Gungok-dong, Jongno-gu.</i>

1088
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:39,060
<i>And the late discovery of the news
has put the residents in fear.</i>

1089
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:41,896
DO NOT ENTER, UNDER INVESTIGATION

1090
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:55,910
<i>The culprit went to different areas,</i>

1091
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:58,704
<i>and his only purpose was to kill.</i>

1092
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:01,082
<i>This is the third murder.</i>

1093
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:03,918
Please do not cross.

1094
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:20,977
What happened here?

1095
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:51,090
<i>It's a serial murder.</i>

1096
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:21,287
<i>A woman in her sixties was found dead
in a residential area in Hwanghwa-dong.</i>

1097
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:22,538
<i>The police launched an investigation.</i>

1098
01:07:22,621 --> 01:07:23,914
-A blunt weapon was used.
-The triangle again?

1099
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:26,709
Something is off. I'm sure he came across
an unexpected situation.

1100
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:28,669
<i>You guys in the Analysis Team
should return to the office.</i>

1101
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:31,338
<i>Entering the crime scene as they please
is obstructing the investigation.</i>

1102
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:32,840
<i>The answers are always found at the scene.</i>

1103
01:07:32,923 --> 01:07:36,260
-What are we supposed to do with that?
-We can buy time.

1104
01:07:36,343 --> 01:07:38,304
<i>Don't tell me you're buying this nonsense.</i>

1105
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:40,598
The only way to prevent him
from committing the next murder…

1106
01:07:41,515 --> 01:07:42,641
is this.
