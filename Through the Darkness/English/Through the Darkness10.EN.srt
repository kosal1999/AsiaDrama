1
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:54,721
What?

2
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:57,474
Do you know me?

3
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,609
HOW THE PROFILER CAUGHT GU YOUNG-CHUN

4
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,069
<i>Gu Young-chun.</i>

5
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,780
You're the guy who caught him.

6
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:17,994
So you do know me.

7
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:23,958
I guess you were very interested
in Gu Young-chun's case.

8
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:27,128
He took the credit for my killing.

9
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,008
That was a ridiculous lie.

10
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:33,968
What do you mean?

11
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,723
I'm not here to interrogate you.

12
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,768
I'm here to help you.

13
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,145
You…

14
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,189
want to help me?

15
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:50,944
But why?

16
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,279
Why would you help me?

17
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,449
My job is to analyze why this happened.

18
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,828
So I'm here to speak with you

19
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,247
and learn more about you.

20
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:03,748
Speak about what?

21
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,251
Well, anything.

22
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,714
Do you live alone?

23
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,676
Then who do you live with?

24
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,052
My mom and younger brother.

25
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,220
What about your father?

26
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,223
He died.

27
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,433
A long time ago.

28
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,354
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

29
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:30,066
CSI SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS
FIELD TRAINING

30
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,281
3 MISSED CALLS
DETECTIVE NAM IL-YOUNG

31
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,744
Detective Nam, you called me.

32
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,289
<i>-Chief Kook.</i>
-I had a lecture at the Police University.

33
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,331
I saw it just now.

34
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,332
It's a robbery case.

35
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,294
They found it suspicious,
so Captain Yoon and I took a look.

36
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:53,256
It reminded me of timid aggression
and I think there's something.

37
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,133
YEONGDEUNGPO POLICE STATION

38
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:58,011
<i>I told Inspector Song right away,
and we rushed here together.</i>

39
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,096
<i>Yeongdeungpo Police Station.</i>

40
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:03,224
-Good day.
<i>-He went to get a confession out of him.</i>

41
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,811
You were convicted of theft
and rape in the past.

42
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,521
You were in jail for quite a while.

43
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,565
I got caught by some unlucky chance.

44
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,650
I didn't even get to do what I intended.

45
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,155
By some unlucky chance?

46
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,073
Had I been lucky,
I wouldn't have been caught.

47
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,912
You broke into the villa
in Sinheung-dong to steal money, right?

48
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:25,413
Yes.

49
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,292
But you only managed to steal 10,000 won.

50
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,378
-Once again, you were unlucky.
-Exactly.

51
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,089
Who knew they'd be so poor?

52
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,092
Why didn't you steal any valuables?

53
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,596
Stealing stuff like that
could leave a trace.

54
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,557
I only steal cash.

55
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,102
You're very cautious.

56
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,105
Yes, I am.

57
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,402
I'm very thorough
when it comes to these things.

58
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:02,283
-Like Gu Young-chun?
-He's a bluffer.

59
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,826
How do you know?

60
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,453
I could tell right away.

61
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,290
You're right. I met him.

62
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,502
He indeed is a bluffer and a loser.

63
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,171
How many people did he say he killed?

64
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,506
Why do you ask?

65
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:20,009
I think he's lying
when he didn't even kill that many.

66
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,263
He said he killed all those people.

67
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,516
I know. You're right.

68
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,601
The Imyeong-dong murder.

69
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,521
That wasn't him, either.

70
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,571
You're a good judge of character.
You've never even met him.

71
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,032
I know these things.

72
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,242
But I have to say,

73
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,203
I've never seen a robber
with a pipe wrench.

74
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,579
Why did you pick such a heavy tool?

75
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,373
Because I may have to kill them.

76
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,958
Why do you have to kill them?

77
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,961
Goodness. Because they saw me.

78
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,879
Are you really a detective?

79
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,633
But most robbers use knives. Am I wrong?

80
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,927
When you stab someone,
they don't always die.

81
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,388
-How do you know?
-Well…

82
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,850
That's…

83
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,686
You know everything.

84
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,023
I know a thing or two
when it comes to this stuff.

85
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,652
But there are more affluent neighborhoods.

86
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,195
Why Sinheung-dong of all places?

87
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,531
Many rich people live in Gangnam.

88
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,701
So I was going to pick my targets there,

89
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,038
but I couldn't
because security was so tight.

90
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,167
So you changed your plan
and targeted low-income buildings.

91
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,503
Poor people can't afford to worry
about security, so they had no choice.

92
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,798
Don't you feel bad for them?

93
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,050
Why should I?

94
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,721
It's their fault for being poor.

95
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,523
-Then why did you start the fire?
-What?

96
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,609
I…

97
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,986
That wasn't me.

98
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,155
I didn't do it.

99
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,657
I didn't start the fire.

100
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,243
I didn't start the fire.

101
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,168
All right,
we can talk about that again later.

102
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:21,089
Being with strangers in jail
must not have been easy.

103
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,132
I know what it's like.

104
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:25,802
How do you know?

105
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,970
I'm an introvert too, just like you.

106
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,598
When I'm keeping to myself,

107
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,475
people assume I don't know anything.

108
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,393
They all look down on me.

109
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,566
Totally.

110
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,279
Everyone thinks I'm an idiot!

111
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:53,579
The detectives here won't hit you.
And no one here thinks you're an idiot.

112
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,207
Everyone here

113
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,835
understands you.

114
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:00,294
Everyone…

115
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,715
hated me.

116
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,009
Everywhere I went,

117
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,095
I had to suffer and get beaten up.

118
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,723
I even had to put up
with that awful thing.

119
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,935
When?

120
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,771
-When I was little.
-How old were you?

121
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,189
When I was in elementary school.

122
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:24,986
Who did that to you?

123
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,030
An old man in my neighborhood.

124
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,618
That must've been a lot to handle.

125
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,872
Do you want to keep talking to me?

126
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:38,791
Yes.

127
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,715
Then answer every question
the detectives here ask you.

128
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,718
Do that, and we'll talk again.

129
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,012
I don't want to go back to jail.

130
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:56,100
Whenever I think about that time,
I'm upset and furious to death.

131
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,897
If you suffered that much,
why didn't you speak with the guards?

132
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,566
I complained numerous times,

133
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,652
but no one listened.

134
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,782
I…

135
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,165
The people here will listen
to everything you say,

136
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,043
so don't worry and just tell them.

137
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,259
And then what?

138
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,431
What will happen
if I tell them everything?

139
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,394
What do you think will happen
if you don't?

140
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,357
I'm sure you don't want

141
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,401
to relive the misery you experienced.

142
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,948
I'll tell them everything I did.

143
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,325
Get me a single cell.

144
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,953
A single cell. That's all I ask for.

145
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,247
Mr. Nam Ki-Tae.

146
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,710
The detectives here know
all about the Imyeong-dong case

147
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,964
as well as the Mogu-dong arson case.

148
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,050
So I suggest you confess voluntarily.

149
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:13,594
Okay.

150
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,436
Let me know if you need anything.

151
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,813
I'll help you.

152
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:38,536
If you're willing to open up and confess,
the detectives here will be all ears.

153
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,289
Everyone here

154
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:44,375
wants to hear you out, just like I do.

155
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,460
But the thing is,

156
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,756
I don't remember every single thing I did.

157
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,093
I just walked around and did it
whenever I felt like it.

158
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,971
So I don't think I can recall
where each one took place.

159
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,933
That's okay.

160
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,560
Just tell us what you remember.

161
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,186
You can take your time.

162
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,063
I will be…

163
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,193
sentenced to death anyway, won't I?

164
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,241
Don't think like that.

165
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,036
We have to talk again, you know?

166
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,961
All right, then.

167
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,809
INTERROGATION ROOM

168
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,156
You're here.

169
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,033
Yes.

170
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,121
-He's here.
-Hello, sir.

171
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,457
How did it go?

172
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,876
-Can we go in now?
-No, wait.

173
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,714
The Southwest Case. It was Nam Ki-Tae.

174
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,133
-See?
-I told you.

175
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,760
The Imyeong-dong case too.

176
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,929
-That was also him.
-What?

177
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,222
-Goodness.
-Unbelievable.

178
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,640
Did he confess?

179
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,891
Yes.

180
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,644
Gosh, we went through so much
because of that case.

181
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,105
We should be strategic
about interrogating him.

182
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,314
Okay.

183
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,733
He's emotionally unstable.

184
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,903
And he seems socially inept.
He struggles to communicate with others.

185
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,280
I knew it.
I thought he looked like a dimwit.

186
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,742
He's never had a relationship with anyone
who supports his words and actions.

187
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,662
Then how should we go about
interrogating him?

188
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,038
If we get angry or yell,

189
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,790
he won't want to talk.

190
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,208
We have to humor him too?

191
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,460
I'm not asking you
to praise him for his crimes.

192
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:55,131
These suspects already know
what the detectives are after.

193
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,425
Even if you treat them nicely,
they won't trust you.

194
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:00,678
She's right. If you seem
to overly approve of what they did,

195
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,513
it can actually backfire.

196
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:03,597
Then what do we do?

197
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,474
Try to avoid showing him
any kind of judgment,

198
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,309
be it positive or negative.

199
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,520
Try to let him do the talking.

200
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,897
Nam Ki-tae has a high tendency
to be socially withdrawn.

201
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,025
He'll become anxious if there are
too many detectives around him.

202
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,653
So we'll have only
a minimal number of people in there.

203
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:21,157
Why are there so many rules
over a simple interrogation?

204
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,324
There has to be.

205
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,244
As everyone here knows,

206
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,788
Nam Ki-Tae is unlike
any other violent criminal.

207
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,915
The victims of the Southwest Case

208
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,710
that we are aware of
come to a total of 14.

209
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,296
Among them, six died.

210
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,840
And there is a high possibility
of many more victims.

211
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,302
This means we cannot miss
even one innocent victim.

212
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:44,597
That is how we can be responsible
in this current situation.

213
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,183
Also, you should not throw
random questions at him.

214
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,185
He has poor communication skills,
so if he gets confused,

215
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,853
he might blurt out just anything.

216
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,023
From now on, we should write down
our questions beforehand.

217
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,149
That is a good idea.

218
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,694
If you don't, he might even agree
with the wrong parts

219
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,197
and give up on making a statement.

220
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:03,866
And one more thing.

221
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,869
Until the interrogation is over,

222
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:10,122
pick out one detective who'll converse
with him the most efficiently.

223
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,584
It'll be the most effective
in getting the answer you want.

224
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,003
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

225
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,514
Nam Ki-Tae was

226
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:30,559
-raped in his childhood.
-By whom?

227
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,144
He just said
an elderly person in his town.

228
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,688
Around when in his childhood?

229
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,106
In elementary school.

230
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,110
He didn't want to elaborate,
so I didn't press him.

231
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:43,155
Nam Ki-Tae was charged with rape
a few times, right?

232
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,866
From child rape to adults, at every age.

233
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,910
There is no crime he stayed away from.

234
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,955
So how did you get him to confess
to the Imyeong-dong case?

235
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,790
He was conscious of Gu Young-chun.

236
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,793
He said Gu Young-chun was showing off
with something he did.

237
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,169
So I provoked him and asked.

238
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,296
Unbelievable.

239
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,840
Were they competitive or something?

240
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,009
Let's go inside.

241
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,346
You walked around?

242
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:10,099
Once I got off the subway,
I always walked from there.

243
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,144
It's a pretty long journey
to the villa in Sinheung 6-dong.

244
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,771
I'm really fit.

245
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,190
I ran ten laps a day.

246
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,400
Ten laps a day?

247
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,861
I had to run fast to avoid getting caught.

248
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,238
How did you choose your crime sites?

249
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,533
I didn't choose anything in particular.

250
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,536
I just walked in places with open doors.

251
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,788
-Just blindly?
-Yes.

252
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,876
People rarely lock
their balconies and windows.

253
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:37,918
<i>Breaking news.</i>

254
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,212

256

257
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,802

258
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,721
<i>But after a fight with Im's father,

259
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,431
<i>and handed over to the police.</i>

260
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:53,225
<i>The suspect is Nam, a man in his 30s.</i>

261

264

<i>and they are now interrogating him

265
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:04,945
It's me.

266
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,323
If you get a call from Seoul Station
or Yeongdeungpo Station,

267
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,200
quickly hand over the files
on the cases in Gyeonggi Province.

268
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,869
SUPERINTENDENT HEO GIL-PYO

269
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:12,995
Those guys?

270
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,205
Yes, they're the real deal.

271
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,541
I've worked with the Analysis Team.

272
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:22,504
What they mostly do is
talk to people like Nam Ki-Tae.

273
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,798
They're the best
at creating the atmosphere

274
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,717
to fish out a confession from suspects.

275
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,137
Do you think they yell and press
like you guys do?

276
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,016
How is the investigation going?

277
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,727
{\an8}He confessed to some of his crimes.

278
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,271
{\an8}In order to increase
the credibility of his confession,

279
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:43,484
{\an8}we are doing our best to inspect the scene
and secure the evidence.

280
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,152
What was his motive?

281
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:48,155
We are yet to put our finger
on anything certain.

282
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,490
We can only assume.

283
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:52,368
So far, we presume it's anxiety
from violence and beatings

284
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,621
{\an8}and the intensification
of social withdrawal.

285
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:58,624
{\an8}So it is likely
due to a combination of such factors.

286
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,043
Were the Southwest Serial Murders
all done by one person?

287
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:04,463
It's tough to come
to a conclusion at the moment.

288
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,383
{\an8}The total number of serial murders
in the southwestern area

289
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,759
{\an8}comes to 11 cases.

290
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:12,179
Guro, Geumcheon, Gwanak,
Dongjak, and Yeongdeungpo.

291
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:15,724
{\an8}These five jurisdictions
are investigating in cooperation.

292
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,521
One second.

293
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,898
Excuse me. Coming through.

294
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,066

299
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,299
Hey, Young-soo.

300
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,718
Where's Nam Ki-Tae's room?

301
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,095
We didn't get there yet,
but I think it's this one.

302
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,771
Look at this jerk.

303
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,648
-In-tak.
-Yes?

304
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,108

-What did the police do?

309
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,553
Did you pull out your knife here?

310
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:35,971
Yes.

311
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,682
And?

312
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,977
It has to be a real knife.

313
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,981
I'm cuffed anyway,
so can you give me a real knife?

314
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,274
You son of a…

315
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,943
-One second!
-Can you move?

316
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,695
Hey, quiet.

317
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,781
That's the only way I can remember better.

318
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,366
-You wicked man!
-Darn you!

319
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,246
Hey, block them.

320
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,665
You jerk! I can't see it!

321
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,794
Did you rape her too?

322
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,879
Did you do anything to her before?

323
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,009
Hello?

324
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:15,803
Hey.

325
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,638
I need you to come here for a second.

326
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,181
Okay.

327
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:26,063
Bring my daughter back!

328
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,231
You cursed jerk!

329
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:30,651
What did you do next?

330
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,072
So the victim fell.

331
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,282
Then you stabbed her more, right?

332
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:38,951
SUSPECT

333
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,985
<i>This afternoon, Nam Ki-Tae, a suspect
in the Southwest Serial Murder Case,</i>

334
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:16,405
<i>conducted the reenactment
for Pureumae Park Murder Case.</i>

00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,866
<i>The police announced today
that they will also conduct a reenactment</i>

336
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:23,370
<i>of the Gocheong-dong Murder Case
and Mogu-dong Arson Murder Case.</i>

337
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,497
Shocking, isn't it?

338
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,335
I knew it was odd.

339
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,671
He recognized me at first sight.

340
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:33,881
Nam Ki-Tae?

341
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:35,340
Yes.

342
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,634
We should refrain from revealing
the identity of our officers.

343
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,469
This isn't some movie.

344
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,388
It wasn't because I wanted to.

345
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:44,391
There is this guy named Im Moo-sik.
A reporter that I don't like.

346
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,393
He put his photo in the article
without asking.

347
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,145
Is he insane?

348
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,315
I guess he didn't think
things would turn out like this.

349
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,358
No one could have imagined.

350
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,153
Hey, take a look at this.

351
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:59,072
All of these are articles
on the Southwest Case.

352
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:00,657
MOGU-DONG ARSON MURDER CASE

353
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,535
It looks like he scrapped the articles
for his crimes.

354
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,873
I'm sure there's more…

355
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,917
other than these.

356
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,315
<i>Why did you set the place on fire?</i>

357
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,652
Me? What fire?

358
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,195
Why are you suddenly asking him that?

359
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,738
Why did you set the place on fire?

360
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,825
Why are you asking us?

361
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,787
Is this…

362
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,622
about Nam Ki-Tae's arson?

363
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,123
Yes.

364
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,626
If he didn't set the place on fire,
he should react like you two,

365
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:55,045
as if he doesn't know
what I'm talking about.

366
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,214
Did he say something else?

367
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,382
Yes.

368
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,384
First, he was flustered at the question.

369
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,053
Then he answered me like this.

370
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,846
I didn't start the fire.

371
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,808
I didn't start the fire.

372
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,977
What kind of nonsense is that?

373
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,438
Nam Ki-Tae is the perpetrator
of the Mogu-dong Arson Murder Case.

374
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,439
-What?
-What now?

375
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,192
Keep your focus on that case
and start pressing him.

376
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,043
-Young-soo!
-Yes?

377
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,503
I need you here.

378
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,130
Why? What is it?

379
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:41,883
What is this?

380
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,388
This punk is no joke.

381
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,016
This explains
why we never got his footprints.

382
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,059
Nam Ki-tae also gave his all
to his murders.

383
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,147
Captain.

384
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,149
Take a look at this.

385
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,276
What's this?

386
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,362
{\an8}FOOD THAT IS GOOD FOR THE EYES

387
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:07,576
{\an8}FOOD THAT IS GOOD FOR THE HEART

388
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,620
This is ridiculous. Darn it.

389
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:15,000
He was fine with harming people,
but he wanted to live a long life?

390
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,960
{\an8}TOMATOES ARE HIGH IN LYCOPENE

391
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,754
THE ANSWER TO HIKING IS THE WAY WE WALK

392
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,131
An eyewitness said
he ran away very quickly.

393
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,675
The statement was correct.

394
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,303
He even studied how to run away quickly.

395
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:31,099
I bet he's hiding the murder weapon
somewhere in the house.

396
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,226
Do you really think
he kept it in the house?

397
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,936
You watched his reenactment
on the news, right?

398
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,563
I did.

399
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,107
How can anyone
make that facial expression?

400
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,942
It really creeped me out.

401
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,986
He gets off
just by thinking about the act.

402
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,197
-He solely kills for pleasure.
-Right.

403
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,867
So he must keep the weapon
somewhere in the house.

404
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,660
I doubt he threw it out.

405
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,830
Then let's look for anything
that could be used as a murder weapon.

406
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,123
Yes, sir.

407
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,000
Find anything that might be
a murder weapon.

408
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,043
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

409
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,045
You came through the balcony.

410
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,005
REENACTMENT OF MOGU-DONG
ARSON AND MURDER CASE

411
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,509
<i>Timid aggression is his characteristic.</i>

412
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:06,802
{\an8}SUSPECT

413
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:08,970
You headed to the smaller bedroom.

414
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,476
{\an8}VICTIM

415
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,697
Wrap it up.

416
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,449
-Hey.
-Hey.

417
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,827
Hey! Take it.

418
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,411
-Step back!
-You murderer!

419
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,540
-Step back!
-You darn murderer!

420
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:39,167
-You need to move back!
-Step back!

421
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,545
-Murderer!
-Hey!

422
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,255
-Just one comment!
-You murderer!

423
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:44,923
-Step back.
-Die!

424
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,967
-Hey, stop him!
-Stop him!

425
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,678
-Die, you murderer!
-Get him to stop!

426
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:50,637
Move back!

427
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,014
You murderer!

428
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,268
-Stop them!
-Die!

429
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,979
-Stop them!
-Just one comment!

430
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,648
-Put him in the car!
-You murderer!

431
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,984
-Stop, and step back!
-Get him to the car.

432
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,652
-Just one question.
-Step back.

433
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,279
-Okay. Go!
-Hold on!

434
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,657
-Step back!
-Stop!

435
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,076
-My baby…
-What about my baby?

436
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,328
-Bring my baby back!
-You murderer!

437
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,413
Calm down!

438
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,502
-Murderer!
-Stop! Step back!

439
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,796
-You need to step back.
-My baby…

440
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:27,591
<i>The suspect in the
Southwest Serial Robbery and Murder Case</i>

441
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,260
<i>performed the reenactment
of the murder at the crime scene today.</i>

442
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:32,762
<i>The victim's family who had to watch
the indifferent behavior of the suspect</i>

443
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,181
<i>trembled in rage once again.</i>

444
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,975
<i>The lack of remorse from the serial killer
during the reenactment brought</i>

445
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:41,146
<i>pain and shock to the victim's family
as well as the neighbors once again.</i>

446
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,608
SERIAL MURDERER GETS HOOKED ON KILLING

447
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,735
Are they shocked or having fun?

448
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,530
Look at them. They are having a field day.

449
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,115
What's there to think about?

450
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:56,870
Your headline should start with his name
and an exclamation mark. Okay?

451
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:59,080
This is the best time
to get our view count up.

452
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:02,292
Do we also have to publish
the same articles like everyone else?

453
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,502
You're not desperate enough.

454
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,922
You said you didn't want people
to look down on you.

455
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,925
We already have so much on our plate.
What's holding you back?

456
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,843
Get a grip, Reporter Choi.

457
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,972
Do we have to join this circus too?

458
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,390
Let's clear something up.

459
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,352
You can't seriously be
asking me about that.

460
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,647
If we don't, we'll fall behind again.

461
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,066
Stop following your ideal.
Just write your article.

462
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:31,404
"Nam Ki-Tae" and an exclamation mark.

463
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,785
Gosh. Am I…

464
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,163
doing this right?

465
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:43,124
How did you know
that he had a social phobia?

466
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:47,170
We didn't get it diagnosed
by a doctor or anything.

467
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,714
We were only commenting
on the suspect's characteristics

468
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,926
like how he rarely talks
and is introverted.

469
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,552
What's the amount of damages?

470
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:57,097
We're investigating
the robbery cases separately.

471
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,808
When we arrested him,
the confirmed sum of the damage

472
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,851
was 10,000 won in cash.

473
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:04,187
-He did that for 10,000 won?
-Just 10,000 won?

474
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,690
Then could we interpret he wasn't after

475
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,025
money or valuables like Gu Young-chun?

476
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,277
Yes. That's right.

477
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,362
For now, we believe this was

478
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:15,156
his way of expressing
disapproval of our society.

479
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,659
NAM KI-TAE

480
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,331
What are you doing here?

481
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,337
I have zero interest in Nam Ki-Tae.

482
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,423
What a surprise.

483
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,927
I thought at least I should be writing
about something else.

484
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:39,264
When everyone in the country
is focused on Nam Ki-Tae?

485
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,809
Hey, the most searched word
is Nam Ki-Tae. Just his name.

486
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:43,935
Right.

487
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,522
I think someone should be writing
about the people

488
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,150
who are left behind, not Nam Ki-Tae.

489
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:55,697
REMORSELESS SUSPECT,
UNCHANGING SOCIETY

490
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,283
-Here's your coffee.
-Thanks.

491
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,711
-Hey, Woo-ju. Do you still draw?
-Yes?

492
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,671
-Draw what?
-You told me

493
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,090
you draw sketches of victims
whenever you have time.

494
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:15,508
Why do you ask?

495
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,637
-My baby…
-What about my baby?

496
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,931
-Bring my baby back!
-My baby!

497
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,225
That just crossed my mind.

498
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,687
I hope you'll keep doing that.

499
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:30,440
Okay. I will.

500
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:48,792
What are you staring at?

501
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:53,838
I was just frustrated.

502
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,467
I was just wondering

503
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:01,721
what people on the street
were thinking about.

504
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,018
"What should I eat today?"

505
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,771
"What should I bring home?"

506
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:11,981
"I'm late for my appointment."

507
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,901
"My boss is so annoying."

508
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:19,280
They are probably thinking
about their day-to-day life. Right?

509
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,700
I can't even remember
the last time I thought about

510
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:24,536
my day-to-day life.

511
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,497
It does feel like we're running

512
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,208
in a race that's never going to end.

513
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,378
Especially when I see criminals

514
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,297
crawling out no matter
how many of them we put away.

515
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,884
Some people in our country
are being brutally murdered.

516
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,888
But some from the same country
have peaceful days.

517
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,559
Nothing has changed in this world.

518
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:48,768
In life,

519
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:53,690
and especially in our line of work,
we see more evil than good.

520
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:57,527
But it's quite sad at times
that we can't have hope

521
00:28:58,486 --> 00:28:59,696
in people.

522
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,074
Whenever I try harder to have hope,

523
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:07,245
I end up facing criminals
that are smarter and more evil.

524
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,875
You have more interviews left
with Nam Ki-Tae, right?

525
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,295
I should interview him
before the prosecution takes him.

526
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,505
"He who fights with monsters

527
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,592

528
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:24,554
that he himself
does not become a monster."

529
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,890
"If you gaze long into an abyss,

530
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:30,226
the abyss also gazes into you."

531
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:32,687
Nietzsche, right?

532
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,165
<i>"Remorseless Suspect,</i>

533
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,209

<i>and Shameless Media Bring Tears

535
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:00,757
<i>The victim was an average college student.</i>

536
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,176
<i>Afraid of going out alone,</i>

537
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,512
<i>the student still cannot return to school.</i>

538
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:09,974
<i>And another victim had to be buried

539
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,018

<i>A playful daughter</i>

543
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:22,612
<i>faced a wrongful death even without
having a chance to say goodbye.</i>

544
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,739
<i>Some people</i>

545
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,491
<i>lost their loved ones overnight.</i>

546
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,577
<i>And these people aren't strangers to us.</i>

547
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,789
<i>They are our neighbors and family.</i>

548
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,671
We found this knife,
but there was no luminol reaction.

549
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:41,589
Gosh. This is driving me crazy.

550
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:46,719
Seeing how he cut the soles of his shoes,
I'm sure he's the culprit.

551
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,097
We need to find the victim's DNA.

552
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,348
No way.

553
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,267
He already confessed to everything.

554
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,769
We won't be forced to release him, right?

555
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,064
If there's no confirmatory evidence,

556
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:01,067
he will only be indicted
for the break-in and aggravated robbery.

557
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,362
On top of that, if he recants
his confession, we'll have nothing.

558
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,697
We must find more evidence.

559
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,741
Actually, Chief Kook
and Inspector Song went back

560
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,660
to his house to look for more evidence.

561
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:15,498
But I get the feeling that
he might have tossed the murder weapon.

562
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:36,811
This place has a similar vibe
to the crime scene.

563
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,855
-Right?
-The districts were different,

564
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:42,066
but he must have chosen
a familiar environment subconsciously.

565
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,152
We should link cases to see
if there are incidents that

566
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,778
took place in a similar environment.

567
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,864
-I'll tell Woo-ju.
-Okay.

568
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:51,784
The detectives can't just sit back
and wait until Nam Ki-Tae talks.

569
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:52,911
Right.

570
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,496
-Let's go in.
-Okay.

571
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,668
Do you really think it's here?

572
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,047
He's obsessed with murder.

573
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,467
Let's look for it.

574
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,956
I've already checked that room.

575
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,838
Help me pull out this wardrobe.

576
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,509
One, two, three.

577
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:52,720
Here?

578
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,826
He didn't even bother
wiping the blood off.

579
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,342
Professor An, look.

580
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,177
Did you see this?

581
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:44,564
Hello?

582
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,941
All right. Thank you.

583
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:49,485
Captain Yoon.

584
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,821
They found Nam Ki-Tae's kitchen knife.

585
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:53,823
So it really was there.

586
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,575
Yes, under the wardrobe.

587
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:58,327
He didn't even wipe the blood off.
He's a total lunatic.

588
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,288
I just got a call from the NFS too.

589
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,873
While examining the pipe wrench,

590
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:04,834
they found hair and an old bloodstain.

591
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,754
So he can't deny it now.

592
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:09,630
When are we sending him
to the prosecution?

593
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,424
It's scheduled for next Friday.

594
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:13,342
The Analysis Team will interview him
before that, right?

595
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,719
That's right.

596
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:17,722
It's going to be tough for Inspector Song.

597
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:20,933
He has to speak with that psycho again.

598
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:26,939

602
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,784
The headline should be
"Memories of Murder in Seoul."

603
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,452
Hurry, you punk!

604
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,038
-Take care of this.
-That's not the situation now.

605
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,331
Hey, bring it over here.

606
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:47,085

{\an8}SINHEUNG 2-DONG CASE REPORT

612
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,114
Are you going to be okay alone?

613
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,324
Knowing how he is,

614
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:21,619
I have to talk to him one on one
to get more out of him.

615
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:37,635
We meet again.

616
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:41,597
I told you that we'll talk again.

617
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,233
So how did it go?

618
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,193
Did the detectives listen
to what you had to say?

619
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,571
Yes, they're good listeners.

620
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,197
Let's talk casually.

621
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:02,160
I'm older than you,
so I'll drop the honorifics.

622
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,288
All the other detectives
talked to me casually anyway.

623
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:09,250
Do you remember telling me
that you had a hard time in jail?

624
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:12,753
Of course, I do.

625
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:17,300
My cellmate who was a thug
beat me up to a pulp.

626
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,969
-Why?
-For no reason.

627
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,597
He beat me up
because I couldn't say anything.

628
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,266
I mean, because I wouldn't say anything.

629
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,355
I'm sure he was surprised
to see me on the news.

630
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,565
That scumbag.

631
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,067
Do you feel better?

632
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,362
Do I?

633
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:40,448
I'm not sure.

634
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:44,035
But I bet he had no idea I'd walk
around with a knife to kill people.

635
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:47,163
He must be in shock, right?

636
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:51,542
Do you remember you told me
you were sexually assaulted as a child?

637
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,343
An old man in your neighborhood, was it?

638
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:02,970
Yes.

639
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,722
How old were you at the time?

640
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,515
I was ten.

641
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,935
He dragged me into the woods

642
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,604
and tied my fingers with my shoelaces…

643
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,401
Hold on.

644
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,280
He tied your fingers?

645
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:23,407
Yes.

646
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,088
He dragged you into the woods

647
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,757
and tied your fingers…

648
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:41,926
<i>with your shoelaces?</i>

649
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,888
By any chance,

650
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,432
is there a sexual assault case
Nam Ki-Tae confessed to?

651
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,600
No.

652
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:52,979
Then see if you can find a similar case

653
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:56,399
where the victim was found in the woods
with fingers tied with shoelaces.

654
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:57,692
I'll see what I can find.

655
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,165
<i>Victim found in woods, shoelaces.</i>

656
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,084
<i>Sexual assault or murder.</i>

657
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,502
<i>See if you can find a case that matches.</i>

658
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,131
A man did that to a little boy.

659
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,133
It was awful.

660
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,303
It must've been tough.

661
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,972
I was very young,
so I didn't know what to think of it.

662
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,809
But I was scared whenever I saw him
after that incident.

663
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,478
That was only the beginning.

664
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,272
What do you mean?

665
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:38,983
My next-door neighbor did it to me twice
when I was in high school.

666
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,277
And it happened again
when I was in the military.

667
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,029
I was like everyone's punching bag.

668
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:44,947
Why didn't you call the police?

669
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,699
I didn't want to.

670
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:50,911
I was too shy
and couldn't even get angry at anyone.

671
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,246
You must've had friends.

672
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,915
At school or in the military.
You must've had someone.

673
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,125
No, I never did.

674
00:38:57,376 --> 00:39:00,254
They all either tried
to use me or bully me.

675
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,883
No one wanted to be my friend.

676
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,385
What about your teachers at school?

677
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,138
My teachers?

678
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,223
The teachers weren't any better.

679
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,977
What's that thing where teachers
record their observations of students?

680
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,313
-Student record?
-That's right.

681
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,857
All through school,

682
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,443
mine said, "Too reliant, passive,

683
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,028
lacks independence."

684
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,697
Those three things were always there.

685
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,743
That's why I still remember
those difficult words.

686
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:36,415
"Reliant, passive, lacks independence."

687
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,460
Didn't it make you angry?

688
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,003
It made me very angry.

689
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,216
But I rarely showed it.

690
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:52,098
Do you want to hear my story?

691
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,225
You have something else to tell me?

692
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:55,810
You haven't heard my story yet.

693
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,900
I wanted to commit a perfect crime.

694
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,653
Once I found out
that I was good at something,

695
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,738
I wanted to be better at it.

696
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:11,492
-That's why you studied?
-Yes, I studied so hard.

697
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,035
I read books.

698
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,830
Whenever they said important stuff on TV,
I jotted it down.

699
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,040
I saw your notes.

700
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:22,420
I wrote down everything
that could be helpful.

701
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,213
Some of your notes were about health.

702
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,382
Why were you so health-conscious?

703
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,009
Because I need to live a long life.

704
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,137
And why is that?

705
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,223
That way, I can kill more people.

706
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,029
Gosh.

707
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,117
-Goodness.
-Oh, you're here.

708
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,128
Do you remember
what your first offense was?

709
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:05,921
Back in elementary school.

710
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,884
I broke into an empty home
and stole money and valuables.

711
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,928
-What about rape?
-I can't really remember that.

712
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,432
I mostly went for kids when I was younger.

713
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,476
They do as you say.

714
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:22,813
How young?

715
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,273
Elementary kids.

716
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,942
How sick do you have to be to do that?

717
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,028
That's why what children experience
is so important.

718
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,821
They accumulate things
without even knowing.

719
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:35,159
Of course, not everyone will become
a criminal from a bad experience.

720
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:38,287
But kids can't manage
situations themselves.

721
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,832
In the case of Nam Ki-Tae,

722
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:45,711
he accumulated
all of his repeated traumas.

723
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,923
I think that influenced
his character-building greatly.

724
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,467
What if, in order to break away
from the negativity,

725
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:56,138
he voluntarily assumed
the role of a killer?

726
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,431
That might be it.

727
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,643
About three years ago,

728
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:04,730
I started to think
about killing people too.

729
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:06,815
That's after you were
released from prison.

730
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,192
Yes.

731
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:11,278
Did you not think
to live straight after being released?

732
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,571
Not really.

733
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,741
There's no changing me, so why try?

734
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:19,078
Instead, I felt a bigger thrill
once I got released.

735
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:22,873
I wanted to try stabbing people
and strangling them too.

736
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,417
Because you felt wronged
for the beatings you got in jail?

737
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:26,877
Of course, I felt wronged.

738
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:30,923
You have no idea how much
I wanted to kill the punk who beat me.

739
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,675
Then you should've talked to him.

740
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,635
Why did you take your anger
out on strangers?

741
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,136
I wasn't taking my anger out.

742
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,139
That's not the reason.

743
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:42,768
I just did it because I liked it.

744
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:45,896
Because you liked it?

745
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,064
You know what?

746
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,027
When I see a person
dying in front of my eyes,

747
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,614
flapping their arms and legs…

748
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:00,452
My heart starts to race.

749
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,089
That's when I finally feel a little alive.

750
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,553
While watching someone dying,

751
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,766
you felt alive?

752
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,353
It's truly euphoric.

753
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:29,398
That's why I can't quit.

754
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,526
Can't quit what?

755
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:34,570
Killing, of course.

756
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:37,948
I could quit smoking,

757
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,825
but I couldn't quit killing.

758
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,496
Didn't you ever think to stop?

759
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,581
No.

760
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,667
I mean…

761
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,504
even not killing for a few days
drove me crazy.

762
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:55,799
So I didn't even try.

763
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,222
That lunatic.

764
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,851
That's why he turned his victims around
to see the faces in the light.

765
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,860
{\an8}<i>There's a case from January 2004
in Bongu-dong, Bucheon.</i>

766
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:17,029
{\an8}<i>A ten-year-old boy was kidnapped,
raped, and murdered.</i>

767
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,781
<i>I'll print the materials for you.</i>

768
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:20,574
BONGU-DONG

769
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:24,495
BONGU-DONG KIDNAPPING AND MURDER

770
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:29,583
BONGU-DONG ELEMENTARY STUDENT
MURDER CASE LEFT UNSOLVED

771
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:33,712
Does anyone happen to know about
a case from two years ago in Bongu-dong?

772
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,715
Where a ten-year-old boy was
kidnapped, raped, and murdered?

773
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,760
I saw it when I was picking out cases
for us to work on.

774
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:40,886
Bongu-dong?

775
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:44,765
Isn't it the cold case from two years ago
that was extensively reported on?

776
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:49,395
Give me the fax number here, please.

777
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,528
RECEIVING SCAN

778
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,863
I guess the more I watch them,

779
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:04,451
the more I want to try
something more violent.

780
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,037
So you kept changing your murder weapon.

781
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,373
At first, I liked
the feeling of strangling.

782
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:12,835
That feeling when they flap about
when they run out of breath.

783
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:19,174
It was more euphoric than I had imagined
when I tried it myself.

784
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:21,552
You keep using the expression, "euphoric."

785
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:25,514
I feel like it expresses the best feeling.

786
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,145
Anyway…

787
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,358
After I came home that day,
I slept like a baby.

788
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:38,402
-Because you felt euphoric?
-Yes.

789
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:42,156
Oh, right. Then I tried using a knife.

790
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:45,367
Watching the blood pumping out
made me go crazy.

791
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:48,036
I was so happy. It was so thrilling.

792
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,582
I sometimes went back
to the neighborhood I killed in

793
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:53,292
and reminisced about it too.

794
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:56,420
-Reminisce?
-Yes.

795
00:45:58,213 --> 00:45:59,798
You liked the knife so much.

796
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:03,260
Why did you switch to a pipe wrench?

797
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:06,805
I wanted to feel
a different sensation from a knife.

798
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,184
Was that after Pureumae Park?

799
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,351
Maybe.

800
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:16,148
I get a little confused
because there are so many.

801
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:20,068
When I used a small knife,
they wouldn't die very easily.

802
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:22,112
So I switched to a kitchen knife.

803
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,072
But it didn't really do the job.

804
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:26,742
It got me annoyed and angry
for some reason.

805
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:29,495
It made me uncomfortable and annoyed
if they didn't die.

806
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:30,787
Why would you get annoyed?

807
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,291
That should not happen in a perfect crime.

808
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:38,712
I was trying to commit the perfect crime.

809
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:40,506
So I didn't rape the girls I killed.

810
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:43,175
-In case you might leave evidence?
-Yes.

811
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,346
No matter how hot it was,
I didn't take my gloves off.

812
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:51,558
Even though the gloves
dulled the sensation a little.

813
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,062
The steel pipe had its perks too,
so it was all right.

814
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,358
That I can stand
if I want to kill more for long.

815
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:02,986
What is the sensation
you're talking about?

816
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:06,949
The head is the weakest part of a human.

817
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,119
The moment you strike it down like this…

818
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:15,624
You'll never understand what I mean
unless you try it yourself.

819
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:18,043
The blood splatters everywhere.

820
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,836
That's when the victims flap about.

821
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,381
That's the moment that makes me go crazy.

822
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:24,716
I'm thrilled to death.

823
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,427
Watching it makes me so happy and elated.

824
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,472
You've never tried it,
so you have no idea.

825
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:35,561
Gosh, I can't listen to him anymore.

826
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:38,105
How does he stand listening to him?

827
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:41,233
This isn't a job for the weak-minded.

828
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:44,069
I have a weak mind.

829
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:45,904
I'm going to step out for a moment.

830
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,160
I need to pee.

831
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:55,789
-You want to use the bathroom?
-Yes.

832
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,463
Hold on. The detectives will be here.

833
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:06,967
-You'll wait for me, right?
-Yes.

834
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,428
I will be right back.

835
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:11,888
Sure. Take your time.

836
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:15,851
Hey.

837
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:20,689
-You gave me a signal earlier, right?
-Yes.

838
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,109
You think this was
Nam Ki-Tae's doing too, right?

839
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:25,944
I do.

840
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:29,156
The way the ten-year-old boy's fingers
were tied up by a shoelace.

841
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,867
The same thing happened
to Nam Ki-Tae in his childhood.

842
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,578
We should interrogate him then.

843
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:37,372
How far does his area of crime
stretch out?

844
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,334
I'm going to go back in.

845
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:42,461
Ha-young.

846
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:48,550
You can leave it
to the detectives in charge here.

847
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,927
You don't have to do everything.

848
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,890
Nam Ki-Tae and I already formed a rapport.

849
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,560
-I'll get his confession the fastest.
-Yes, that's true.

850
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,607
But all those horrible things
that he's pouring out…

851
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,360
There's no need for you
to bear it all yourself.

852
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:07,778
I wouldn't have even started…

853
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,238
if I was going to avoid it.

854
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:11,990
You're right.

855
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:14,618
I worried for nothing.

856
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:15,911
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

857
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,836
INTERROGATION ROOM

858
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:32,886
You get scared easily, right?

859
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:34,805
Me?

860
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:38,308
You chose to commit crimes
only around Seoul and Gyeonggi,

861
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:39,810
in neighborhoods close to you.

862
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:41,978
What if I get caught
going to a foreign place?

863
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,146
For your perfect crime?

864
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:47,901
-That's why you ran with all your might?
-How did you know I ran every day?

865
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:50,570
-You ran every day?
-You didn't know then.

866
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,490
I thought you knew that too,
so I was shocked.

867
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:55,909
I saw you wrote down
running methods in your notes.

868
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:59,121
I ran around the school's field ten times.
I didn't miss a single day.

869
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,666
So running is the one thing
I'm confident about.

870
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:04,251
Wait, no.

871
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,920
I'm good at killing people too.

872
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:09,172
Once I started going
to different neighborhoods,

873
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:11,466
it made me want to visit Busan too.

874
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,677
I couldn't go because I got caught.

875
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,055
Weren't you scared when the news
started to focus its attention on you?

876
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,348
Why would I be scared?

877
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:19,683
You might get caught.

878
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,227
Gu Young-chun.

879
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:25,605
He said he was scared, right?

880
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,107
Why are you bringing him up?

881
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,942
That punk is a loser.

882
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,321
I liked trying to avoid the police.
I found it very thrilling.

883
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,490
-Thrilling?
-Yes.

884
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:42,247
Do you still feel no remorse
towards those people?

885
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:43,498
Why would I feel remorse?

886
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,252
I'm not sorry at all.
I don't even feel guilty.

887
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:51,506
All I wanted to do was kill more people.

888
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:57,179
When I saw what I did on the TV,
I felt like I became a hero.

889
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:00,557
I felt proud
thinking that I killed that person.

890
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,975
Then I felt like the TV…

891
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:07,439
What was that?

892
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,320
You were proud
and felt like a hero, right?

893
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,532
You took a ten-year-old kid
to the woods in Bongu-dong,

894
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,117
tied up his fingers with shoelaces,

895
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:23,580
then committed the atrocity
you experienced to that little kid.

896
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:26,708
Isn't that so?

897
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,710
Why are you suddenly getting angry?

898
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,797
Will anything change if I confess?

899
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,256
If you don't confess,

900
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,593
people like Gu Young-chun
will bluff and say they did it.

901
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:37,761
Damn it.

902
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:39,930
I did it.

903
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:48,814
FINGER WAS TIED WITH SHOELACES
JUNG WAS PLAYING SOCCER WITH FRIENDS

904
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:50,607
What was he doing at that time?

905
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:53,360
-He was playing with a ball.
-Be specific.

906
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:54,486
Soccer.

907
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:57,531
Happy now?

908
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,658
I'll share the details
with the detectives.

909
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,664
Can I go back to what I was saying?

910
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,417
Do you enjoy talking about
stuff like this?

911
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:10,585
It's fun.

912
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:14,047
No one has ever listened to me before.

913
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:16,424
Why do you think
people don't want to talk to you?

914
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:18,552
They're all normal,
but I seem like a psycho.

915
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:19,970
A psycho?

916
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:23,014
You know, confused and anxious.

917
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:27,227
This confusion often drives me insane too.

918
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,937
I'm sure I seem weird to others.

919
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,481
And you were freed from such emotions
when you killed?

920
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:32,899
I told you already.

921
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:34,943
That's why I can't stop.

922
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,489
When I stab,

923
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:42,409
I try to avoid the parts
where the blood would spatter.

924
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,286
I stab in the ribs or stomach.

925
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:48,707
Then I can feel all the different
sensations from the knife going in.

926
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:52,794
You should see
the expressions on their faces.

927
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,546
You never know unless you see it.

928
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:58,008
I want to do it again.

929
00:52:58,091 --> 00:53:00,635
I think you're less than a beast.

930
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:02,846
What do you think?

931
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:07,976
You're not a hero.

932
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,148
You seem like an angry lunatic
who just throws his knife around.

933
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:14,274
You're right.

934
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:17,444
I never denied that.

935
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:22,699
Let me continue.

936
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:24,075
You're going to continue?

937
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:27,704
I couldn't share this with anyone,
so I was really frustrated.

938
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:29,748
It's now or never, right?

939
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:31,166
So stay and listen.

940
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:34,753
Among many ways of killing,

941
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:37,297
my favorite is
hitting someone on the head.

942
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,008
As I mentioned before, it's the flapping.

943
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:42,886
It feels awesome to watch them flap about.

944
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:45,805
Once I kill someone like that,
the ecstasy stays with me

945
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,223
for a week or two.

946
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:49,184
But after a while,

947
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:51,811
the impulse comes back
and it's even worse.

948
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:54,064
Then as my impulse gets stronger,

949
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:57,734
there is no other way
than to go out and kill someone.

950
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:59,945
I promise. Just once more.

951
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:02,238
I want to go out and kill someone.

952
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:03,782
I need to feel that ecstasy.

953
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:06,034
Detective.

954
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:09,287
-Detective?
-Yes?

955
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:11,748
Are you listening?

956
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,297
-Nam Ki-Tae.
-Yes?

957
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,176
Do you think it's unfair
that you were caught?

958
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:24,427
It is unfair.

959
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:28,014
If I hadn't gotten caught,

960
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,768
I would've lived my life
traveling around the country,

961
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:34,562
becoming the best serial killer
in history.

962
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,525
It's a shame when I think about that.

963
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:42,028
I can never do this again.

964
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,032
You're right.

965
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,288
You won't be able to do this anymore.

966
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:13,101
I think it's a relief.

967
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:15,228
I was really worried.

968
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:16,271
-He's here.
-Ha-young.

969
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:17,522
-He's here.
-He's back.

970
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:20,859
He made a confession

971
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,028
about the Bongu-dong case.

972
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:24,904
-Nam Ki-Tae is unbelievable.
-My gosh.

973
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:27,323
Word got around about you for a reason.

974
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:29,617
I didn't know
he'd continue to confess until now.

975
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,162
Good work.

976
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:34,414
Thank you.

977
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,291
Yes, let's go.

978
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:38,752
-Good work.
-Good work, everyone.

979
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,879
-Good work.
-Good job.

980
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:43,381
-Good work.
-Great work.

981
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:44,466
Wait, Inspector Song.

982
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:47,844
I heard this was yours.

983
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:49,304
I was told to keep it well.

984
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:50,388
I almost forgot.

985
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:52,682
Thank you.

986
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,900
-Why are you throwing this out?
-Nam Ki-Tae used that.

987
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:29,385
Over here!

988
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:30,887
-Nam Ki-Tae!
-Look over here!

989
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,264
-Move aside. Move.
-Look over here!

You really refuse to go out

<i>The prosecution plans to conduct
additional investigations…</i>

1005
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,636
Then what? Should I go?

1006
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:13,930
Fine, I'll go.

1007
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:17,058
<i>Then they will decide
whether to indict him additionally.</i>

1008

-Nam Ki-Tae!
-Nam Ki-Tae!

1009
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:33,116
YEONGDEUNGPO POLICE STATION

1010
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:37,912
Choi Yoon-ji isn't so bad,
but she never gets it right.

1011
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:42,333
Song Ha-young throws him bait,
then Nam Ki-Tae gives him the whole story.

1012
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:46,421
Why the heck is she going on
about people who are left behind?

1013
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,341
I'm telling you.

1014
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:53,344
He looked straight at the victims
when he killed them.

1015
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:57,182
What do you think was on his mind?

1016
00:57:57,765 --> 00:58:00,643
It'd be awesome
if I could get an interview on that.

1017
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:02,645
Bye.

1018
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,283
Goodness, Inspector Song. Hello…

1019
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:17,869
What? What are you doing?

1020
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:23,291
You aren't so different from Nam Ki-Tae.

1021
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:24,459
What did you say?

1022
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,711
Are you insane, you jerk?

1023
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:30,590
Darn it, let go. Let go of me.

1024
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:32,842
How dare you disrespect
a reporter like this?

1025
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:34,928
You're going to regret this.

1026
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:37,013
I'll sue you immediately!

1027
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:39,891
Listen up.

1028
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:42,352
You completely disregard the victims
saying you have the right to know

1029
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:44,020
as if you reporters are something.

1030
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:49,108
You should be thankful
that I'm not suing you first.

1031
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:55,406
That's for using my photo
without permission.

1032
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,371
That crazy jerk.

1033
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,584
-Who made this?
-Gosh, that's nice.

1034
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:08,086
-Daddy.
-Look at Daddy.

1035
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:10,046
-How do you feel?
-That's it.

1036
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:11,923
The weather is wonderful.

1037
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,675
Thanks for making gimbap, honey.

1038
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:16,261
What should we eat for dinner?

1039
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:17,637
How about pizza?

1040
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:21,391
Hey! Wait for me!

1041
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:30,984
<i>Detective.</i>

1042
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:34,237

-Yes?</i>

<i>Blame the girl's bad luck.</i>

1046
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:48,626
I'm saying it's her fault
for catching my attention.

1047
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:49,669
<i>Look at me.</i>

1048
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:53,298
I ended up in here
trying to get some freebies.

1049
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:56,009
<i>Well, I wouldn't say I have the right.</i>

1050
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,428
But killing is sort of like my job.

1051
00:59:58,511 --> 00:59:59,762
<i>Because I need to live a long life.</i>

1052
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:02,307
That way, I can kill more people.

1053
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:24,370
Every time I saw her
just putting up with it,

1054
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,830
it made me so angry.

1055
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:36,966
<i>Arms and legs…</i>

1056
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:40,386
Cut them off and divide them into two.
How many do you have?

1057
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:47,268
<i>You know the bathroom threshold?</i>

1058
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:48,645
The threshold…

1059
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:52,357
is the line that separates
the living realm and underworld.

1060
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:57,862
The line between life and death

1061
01:00:57,945 --> 01:00:59,489
which is decided and ruled by me.

1062
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:57,463
EMERGENCY WARD

1063
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:08,266
Ha-young! Please help!

1064
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:10,017
My son fell into the water!

1065
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:13,229
<i>Oh, no! What do I do?</i>

1066
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,908
<i>Do you know how scary it is</i>

1067
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:27,994
<i>when you're deep underwater?</i>

1068
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:35,710
<i>She must've been scared and sad.</i>

1069
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:28,846
TOJUNG-DONG, ANYANG, GYEONGGI PROVINCE

1070
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:30,848
Gosh. It's freezing.

1071
01:03:44,278 --> 01:03:47,448
I'm trying to go to Daejong Lake.
Which way do I need to go?

1072
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:48,616
Pardon?

1073
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,702
You don't have to be suspicious.

1074
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:54,163
I've never been here before.

1075
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:58,793
There.

1076
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:02,380
Turn right at the intersection up ahead.
And then go straight.

1077
01:04:02,463 --> 01:04:04,799
When you see another intersection,
you turn left and--

1078
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:06,008
Where are you going?

1079
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:07,468
Pardon?

1080
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:09,929
If you don't mind, I can give you a ride.

1081
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:12,807
No, it's okay. I can take the bus.

1082
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:15,935
You don't have to be suspicious.

1083
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:18,145
I'm driving down anyway.

1084
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:20,356
If you're going in the same direction,
I'll give you a ride.

1085
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:23,234
And you can tell me
the way to Daejong Lake.

1086
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:24,944
That will be helpful for me.

1087
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:32,827
Don't you have to wait
for a long time for the bus?

1088
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:37,248
You must feel uncomfortable.

1089
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:41,544
Then could you tell me
how to get there one more time?

1090
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:44,171
Turn right at that intersection, and then…

1091
01:04:45,506 --> 01:04:46,591
What was that?

1092
01:04:47,174 --> 01:04:49,010
You'll see a smaller intersection.

1093
01:04:49,093 --> 01:04:52,054
-Then turn left there.
-Hold on. Let me write it down.

1094
01:04:59,854 --> 01:05:01,439
Gosh. I don't even have paper.

1095
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,320
Why don't you get in
and make things easier for both of us?

1096
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:09,405
Aren't you cold?

1097
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:20,333
I won't refuse then.

1098
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:22,752
No problem.

1099
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:24,879
Please get in.

1100
01:05:24,962 --> 01:05:27,256
-You must be freezing.
-Thank you.

1101
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:44,815
You must like dogs.

1102
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:58,829
You can drop me off somewhere over here.

1103
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:01,666
You just need to turn left over there.

1104
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:03,709
Right here.

1105
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,419
That will do.

1106
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:11,550
You missed it.

1107
01:06:12,176 --> 01:06:14,720
I had to go right from there.

1108
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:16,263
Drop me off here, please.

1109
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:17,682
I'll get out here.

1110
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,893
Hey. Stop the car.

1111
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:26,607
What are you doing?

1112
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:28,776
What are you doing? Stop the car now!

1113
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:32,446
I want a quiet ride.

1114
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:35,157
Stop the car now!
If you don't, I'll call the police!

1115
01:06:36,742 --> 01:06:38,077
I'm calling the cops.

1116
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:45,835
Open the door!

1117
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,006
Damn it.
