00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:42,500
GYEONGGI POLICE
WITH SAFETY, ORDER, AND RESPONSIBILITY

2
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,808
MISSING PERSON
NAME: AN YU-YEON

3
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,519
That's too blurry.

4
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,354
That won't be enough

5
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,108
for us to confirm if the woman next to him

6
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,069
is the missing woman or not.

7
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,571
You guys have good eyes.
Take a closer look.

8
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:14,824
If it were the older cameras,
it would've been more blurry.

9
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,910
Young-soo kept pushing for them too.

10
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,036
It's blurry,

11
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:20,789
but the vehicle was spotted

12
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:23,208
{\an8}around the locations
where the women went missing.

13
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,250
Detective Nam.

14
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,961
-Did you run the license plate?
-I put in a request.

15
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:30,715
We used the security cameras
to track him on the same night.

16
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,718
But we couldn't track him
after the 5km mark.

17
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,472
We can suspect that he probably

18
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,641
went to someplace secluded.

19
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,017
If he's our guy,

20
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,312
he probably abandoned the body right away.

21
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:52,987
Yes?

22
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,031
Woo Ho-sung?

23
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:57,742
Okay.

24
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,120
A 38-year-old man, Woo Ho-sung.

25
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,372
They faxed us the information
of the vehicle owner.

26
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,289
Okay.

27
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,756
The vehicle owner is Woo Ho-sung,
a 38-year-old man.

28
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,342
He works at an acupressure massage parlor.

29
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:17,929
Why does he look so normal?
This is so creepy.

30
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:21,432
Those who look normal
are good at scamming people.

31
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,393
Shouldn't we check his alibi first?

32
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,270
I'll take Detective Nam with me.

33
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,397
-Okay.
-Then can you pay attention

34
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,859
to his reaction
when you meet him for the first time?

35
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,236
-Sure.
-I already know.

36
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,863
I bet he'll say he didn't do it.

37
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,531
He'll probably deny everything

38
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,824
even if he did it.

39
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,701
Right. He'll deny it.

40
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:41,703
So Captain Yoon,

41
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,290
I need you to check if he gets angry
or remains calm when you question him.

42
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,835
Pay attention to the subtle changes
in his attitude or the way he talks.

43
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,629
It will help us
with our interrogation strategy.

44
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,256
You got it.

45
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,926
To women, he's still a stranger.

46
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,137
No matter how approachable he seems,

47
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,639
they would still be hesitant
to get in his car, right?

48
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:02,807
Right.

49
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,393
And women tend to be more cautious,
especially at night,

50
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,687
no matter how kind they seem.

51
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,314
If he didn't force them to get in,

52
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:13,067
it's likely that he made them feel guilty

53
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,612
about turning down his kindness.

54
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,448
He made them feel guilty
by pretending to be kind?

55
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,033
This bastard is unbelievable.

56
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,327
This guy could skip town for all we know.

57
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,120
-So be careful.
-Okay.

58
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:25,496
We'll be back.

59
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,290
Call us if there's anything.

60
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,875
-Okay.
-We'll call you.

61
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,376
-Thank you.
-Sure.

62
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,435
I think this is the place.

63
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,479
-I'll check if there's an exit.
-Okay.

64
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,563
ROYAL ACUPRESSURE, ANSAN, GYEONGGI

65
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,154
None, right?

66
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,614
This is the only exit.

67
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,032
Okay. Let's go inside.

68
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,328
-Hello.
-Welcome.

69
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,873
Do you have an appointment?

70
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,709
We're from Wide-Area Investigation Squad.

71
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,837
Our business isn't illegal.

72
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,423
We're here to see Mr. Woo Ho-sung.

73
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,508
He's here, right?

74
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,636
Why do the police want to see him?

75
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,471
Could you bring him out?

76
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:26,140
He's with a customer now.

77
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,934
Then we'll wait here.

78
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:32,480
But your customers will come and go.
You're okay with that, right?

79
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:34,607
Please wait.

80
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,818
Sure.

81
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,576
There.

82
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,751
Is that a wig?

83
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,211
I can't see his face clearly.

84
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,754
How do his hands look to you?

85
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,217
You wanted to see me?

86
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,011
Mr. Woo Ho-sung?

87
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,346
Yes. That's me.

88
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,102
Could we step out for a moment?
We have some questions.

89
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,480
We can talk here.

90
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,773
Let's do this outside.

91
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,775
No. I'm sorry.

92
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,986
My customer is waiting for me inside.

93
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,822
It's fine. Let's talk here.

94
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:30,747
Where were you on February 23
from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m.?

95
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,124
And what were you doing that day?

96
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,045
Why do you ask?

97
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,297
We need to verify your alibi

98
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,424
for a case we're working on.

99
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:47,388
Did I do something wrong,

100
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,223
Detective Yoon?

101
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,434
On the night of February 23,

102
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,562
a woman in her 20s went missing in Gunpo.

103
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:59,317
That's the case we're investigating now.

104
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,819
And your vehicle was caught

105
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,363
on the security camera

106
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,532
in the area where the victim was.

107
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,619
My goodness. I didn't know about that.

108
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,748
February 23… Was that Thursday?

109
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,416
It was last Friday.

110
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,627
I see. Friday. Then, on February 23,

111
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,547
my shift must have ended before 5 p.m.

112
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:22,757
Right?

113
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,011
Yes. That's correct. Take a look.

114
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,016
WOO HO-SUNG

115
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,727
-I see.
-I had dinner around here

116
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,855
with my girlfriend. And then I went home.

117
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,445
And my girlfriend also happens
to live in Gunpo.

118
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,366
There are dangerous people in the world.

119
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:51,452
So I can never let her go alone.
I always drop her off.

120
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,288
And I drove her home that night as always.

121
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,457
I don't remember the exact time,

122
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:00,253
but I was home around 10 p.m.

123
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:05,716
Could we get your girlfriend's

124
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,301
phone number?

125
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,762
I can't.

126
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,975
Am I obligated by law
to give you her number?

127
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,064
I don't want my girlfriend to worry.

128
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,734
Then how about this?

129
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,321
You can check my alibi
at the restaurant we went to that day.

130
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,990
I made a reservation before going.

131
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,411
Check it yourself.

132
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,414
What if we go there and ask them, but…

133
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,999
Go check first.

134
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,251
If you still can't confirm my alibi,

135
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,962
I'll give you her number then.

136
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,007
Is that all?

137
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,426
I have to get back in.

138
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,763
Thank you for your cooperation.

139
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:53,931
You're welcome.

140
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,689
-Thank you. Take care.
-You too.

141
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,525
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

142
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,111
I'll give you ten extra minutes

143
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,739
to make up for it.

144
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:36,224
If we combed through the entire area
but didn't find additional bodies,

145
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,768
it means he buried them elsewhere.

146
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,437
Like the sixth case, it must be a place
that can't easily be found.

147
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,856
We have to ask him about it
when we interrogate him.

148
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,568
The sixth victim, Yoon Jin-sil,
was abducted in Anyang.

149
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,697
Then Woo Ho-sung buried her
on his way home to Ansan.

150
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,617
And his place isn't far from the bank
where money was withdrawn

151
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,452
from the account of An Yu-yeon,
the seventh victim.

152
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,622
He doesn't live far from
where the other victims went missing,

153
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,958
assuming that he was driving.

154
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,794
And his vehicle was caught on camera,

155
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,255
heading in the same direction
that the culprit must've gone.

156
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,050
Woo Ho-sung is our prime suspect.

157
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,887
Woo Ho-sung, that scumbag.

158
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,015
It's possible
he's also committed insurance scams.

159
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,898
<i>I'm Detective Nam from
the Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency.</i>

160
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,859
Did someone named Woo Ho-sung
have a reservation here?

161
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,988
Woo Ho-sung? What's his phone number?

162
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,448
That is him.

163
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,825
WOO HO-SUNG

164
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,705
Yes, Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency…

165
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:42,999
It's Detective Yoon.

166
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,626
Hang on. Let me put you on speaker.

167
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,422
Go ahead.

168
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,757
Does he have an alibi?

169
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,217
He said he had dinner

170
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,136
with his girlfriend that evening.

171
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,180
<i>After that, he drove her home.</i>

172
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,933
Detective Nam went
to the restaurant to check.

173
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:02,935
What's his attitude like?

174
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,186
He seemed self-assured.

175
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,106
And he's confident.

176
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,234
<i>He also seemed relaxed.</i>

177
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:14,155
He sounds polite and has good manners,

178
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,741
so I can see the victims
letting their guard down easily

179
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:20,786
after a few awkward moments
upon encountering a stranger.

180
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,913
You haven't checked his car, have you?

181
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,915
We can't search his car without a warrant.

182
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,919
If we aren't careful,
he may try to destroy evidence,

183
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:32,048
so we'll wait until he gets off work
and check naturally

184
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,341
when he gets in his car.

185
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,389
How did it go?

186
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,975
He was at the restaurant that evening.

187
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:47,188
He did have a reservation under his name,
and I checked the CCTV footage too.

188
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,690
The woman he was with
wasn't the one who went missing.

189
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,484
I think it was his girlfriend.

190
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,531
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

191
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,412
Wait, Ho-sung.

192
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,373
What did the detectives want?

193
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,708
I think there was a misunderstanding.

194
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,794
How could they suspect you, of all people?

195
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,797
-It's all cleared up now.
-Good.

196
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,641
He's different from those who don't have

197
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:27,311
the ability to lure their victims or those
who launch random motiveless attacks.

198
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:31,524
On top of his expensive car
and likable face,

199
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,151
he has a way with words.
He used all those things

200
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,821
to find and lure his victims.

201
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,948
He knows that it works.

202
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,326
That's where
Woo Ho-sung's confidence comes from.

203
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,494
That's right.

204
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,581
Yes, Wide-Area Investigation Squad…

205
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:49,166
Hey.

206
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,167
Hold on.

207
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,253
Go ahead.

208
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,297
<i>We have confirmed his alibi
that he had dinner</i>

209
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,924
<i>with his girlfriend that evening.</i>

210
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:59,301
Do we know what else he did that night?

211
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,887
Detective Moon at Anyang Station
looked into it,

212
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,057
but there was nothing on his call log
after 7 p.m. that evening.

213
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:09,728
<i>We checked all the cameras near his home,</i>

214
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,605
<i>and he got home at around 1:00 a.m.</i>

215
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,778
He told us that he got home
at around 10 p.m.

216
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,908
We need to go and check.
I wish we could search his house now.

217
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,660
Our priority is securing evidence.

218
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:27,955
If we put in a request
for a search and seizure warrant now,

219
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,249
the prosecutors will laugh at us.

220
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,418
-It won't be issued.
-<i>Chief Park.</i>

221
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:35,421
We'll wait here
until Woo Ho-sung gets off work

222
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,214
and ask him to voluntarily
come into the station.

223
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:38,883
I'll call you back.

224
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,470
Goodness.

225
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,346
Even if we request a warrant now,

226
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,974
we won't get it tonight.

227
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,857
Okay, fine.

228
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,109
I'll speak with Superintendent Heo.

229
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,528
I'm getting a bad feeling.

230
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,821
NAME: WOO HO-SUNG

231
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:04,533
We need a search and seizure warrant
for Woo Ho-sung's vehicle and residence.

232
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,702
We must secure evidence
as soon as possible.

233
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,789
It's also possible he committed
insurance scams in the past.

234
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,292
Insurance scams? What did he do?

235
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,294
In 2005,

236
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:18,047
his wife and mother-in-law died in a fire.

237
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,675
The life insurance payout he got
was 400 million won in total.

238
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,676
400 million won?

239
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,805
He had signed up
for various life insurance policies.

240
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,767
But the insurance companies
must've deemed it legitimate for him

241
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,268
to have received the money.

242
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,770
On what grounds are we suspecting him?

243
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:37,107
Even with Gu Young-chun and Nam Ki-Tae,
we found evidence in their homes.

244
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:41,487
We can't let this guy buy time.
Not even another moment.

245
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,072
He'll destroy all the evidence.

246
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,074
And this is

247
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:49,161
Song Ha-young's profiling report.

{\an8}GYEONGGI SERIAL MISSING WOMEN CASE
PROFILING REPORT

Everyone now knows he was instrumental
in tracking down Gu Young-chun

250
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,921
and Nam Ki-Tae.

251
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,966
You should submit this
along with the request.

252
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,552
Okay, I'll speak with Prosecutor Jang.

253
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,055
But I highly doubt
that it'll be issued today.

00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,186
Should I go pick up some snacks?

256
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,437
I guess you're hungry.

257
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,356
A little.

258
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:22,903
Go ahead.

259
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,990
-Okay.
-Wait, Detective Nam.

261
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:55,686
Mr. Woo Ho-sung!

262
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,987
Do you still have more questions for me?

263
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,614
We believe it'll take a while.

264
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,823
Could we talk

265
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,367
at the station?

266
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:13,037
Are you arresting me now?

267
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,375
Can I see the warrant?

268
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,960
We're asking you
to voluntarily come with us.

269
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,795
You may refuse if you don't want to.

270
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,881
But if you refuse,

271
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,592
it will make us more suspicious of you.

272
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,679
We'll continue to keep
a close watch on you.

273
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,106
Okay, fine.
I'll come in and give a statement.

274
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,525
-Then let's take our--
-The thing is,

275
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:47,029
I was booked back-to-back today,
so I'm very tired right now.

276
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,073
But I'm off tomorrow,

277
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:52,117
so may I visit the station
sometime tomorrow morning?

278
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:10,803
Sure.

279
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,597
Please come…

280
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,350
to the Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency.

281
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,936
-If you don't come…
-I know.

282
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,231
Why wouldn't I when I did nothing wrong?

283
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:26,151
I just have to
ask for Detective Yoon, right?

284
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,320
-Yes.
-Okay.

285
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:30,906
I'll see you tomorrow.

286
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,411
See you tomorrow.

287
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:49,967
I saw…

288
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:53,345
a photo of him with two dogs in his car.

289
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,931
And there was a huge teddy bear
in the back seat.

290
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,599
Just as we expected.

291
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,310
As you said, he's too calm.

292
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,603
He'll come tomorrow, right?

293
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,772
If he flees, it's him for sure,
so we can put out an APB.

294
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,811
Good work today. Let's call it a night.

295
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,732
GYEONGGI PROVINCIAL POLICE AGENCY

296
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,943
I can't stop thinking
that he's the culprit.

297
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:55,240
He fits every quality
of the suspect we presumed.

298
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,159
He's amicable and has good manners.

299
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,327
He even has a nice car.

300
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,329
He even has a luring mechanism in his car.

301
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,207
He's under suspicion
of arson and insurance fraud.

302
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,168
We have to be open to the possibility
he's proficient in arson.

303
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,838
There's no perp
who only commits one crime.

304
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,341
All we need is the warrant.

305
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,763
I'm sure he was psychologically pressured.

306
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,414
GYEONGGI PROVINCIAL POLICE AGENCY

307
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:52,232
Wide-Area Investigation Squad,
Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency.

308
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,776
<i>May I speak to Detective Yoon Tae-gu?</i>

309
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,197
Who's calling?

310
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,743
I'm the guy
who was supposed to meet her today.

311
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,537
If she's in the office,
could you put her on?

312
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:11,084
She's not in the office. If you leave
a message, I'll relay it to her.

313
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,504
Hello?

314
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,466
-Hello?
<i>-In that case, I'll call back…</i>

315
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,718
One second, she just came in.
I'll put her on right away.

316
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,845
Captain Yoon, it's Woo Ho-sung.

317
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,186
I'm on the line.
You've reached Yoon Tae-gu.

318
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,855
Hello. This is Woo Ho-sung.

319
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,566
Mr. Woo Ho-sung.

320
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:42,574
<i>Do you take a report like this
at Wide-Area Investigation?</i>

321
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:47,579
Someone set my car on fire.

322
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,544
Sorry?

323
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,089
What do you mean?

324
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,177
Does Wide-Area Investigation Squad
take reports like this?

325
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,906
I thought he was a pretty smart guy,
but he wasn't.

326
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,992
He's just feeling guilty.

327
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,246
We got the warrant more quickly
thanks to his show.

328
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:30,956
It's nice.

329
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,960
And the profiling report
also played a part.

330
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:38,672
WOO HO-SUNG'S HOME

331
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,098
As of this hour,

332
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:52,602
we will begin the search and seizure
of every article in your house.

333
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,315
Also, Woo Ho-sung.

334
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:59,401
You are under emergency arrest
for suspicions of abduction.

335
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,322
You should be looking for the person
who set my car on fire.

336
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,034
Why are you arresting me?

337
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,287
You have the right to an attorney,

338
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,456
and you have the right to remain silent.

339
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:17,961
Everything you say can and will be

340
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:22,341
used to the extreme disadvantage
against you in court.

341
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,550
Do you understand?

342
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,139
Just as I expected, he's confident.

343
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:32,642
He knew we'd get suspicious of him
for setting his car on fire.

344
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,603
But he still chose to do that
to get rid of the evidence.

345
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:38,273
We pressured him to go talk
at the police station,

346
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,317
so he got anxious
and made the wrong choice.

347
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,070
I think he wanted to play the victim.

348
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:47,866
But he was in a hurry, so he must have
resorted to something he was used to.

349
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:52,537
He forgot that he was under suspicion
of arson and insurance fraud.

350
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,918
Does he think the police are a joke?
As if we wouldn't have looked into it.

351
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,962
I guess he does think
he's smarter than others.

352
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,631
He tripped over his own feet.

353
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,424
Let's go inside.

354
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,263
You haven't figured out anything.

355
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:13,767
Why don't you undo this
before we start talking?

356
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:33,662
The fingers that punched in

357
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,622
the PIN at the ATM to withdraw money.

358
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:37,999
It's similar

359
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:39,751
to Woo Ho-sung's hand.

360
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:40,919
Did you see it?

361
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:44,631
<i>When I went to the massage parlor
and when I cuffed him.</i>

362
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:45,674
I saw his hands.

363
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,551
Woo Ho-sung is also conscious of that.

364
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:50,887
It looks like it.

365
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,807
Are other detectives watching me

366
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,434
from behind that wall?

367
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,186
You know why you're here, right?

368
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,980
How many of you are there?

369
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,483
Didn't you hear me?
I asked you a question.

370
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,611
I'm not sure.

371
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,364
She told you when she cuffed you.

372
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:10,323
Abduction.

373
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,118
Who? Who did I abduct?

374
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,203
You would know better than us.

375
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:19,708
Do you have evidence?

376
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,502
That's why we arrested you.

377
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:25,130
Even if you search through my house,

378
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,007
you won't find anything.

379
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,517
SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS

380
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,060
Did you find anything?

381
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,896
I don't see anything in particular.

382
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,990
He formatted everything.

383
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:55,160
This is you, isn't it?

384
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,244
CCTV FOOTAGE EVIDENCE

385
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:58,872
What is this?

386
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:02,959
You used the debit card of a woman
who went missing and withdrew cash.

387
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,129
Show me

388
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,382
the evidence that this is me.

389
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,219
Where is that woman?

390
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,762
Who?

391
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,680
This is you.

392
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:16,848
Where is she?

393
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,186
I really have no idea
what you're talking about.

394
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:23,313
At 2 p.m. on February 24,

395
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:24,731
tell me where you were.

396
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:32,822
I slept at home.

397
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,824
Not that. Give me something else.

398
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,661
Something more feasible.

399
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,958
I said I slept at home.

400
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,710
Do you expect me to believe
that you were asleep in broad daylight?

401
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,462
In this situation?

402
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:50,465
What would I do on weekends?
I should sleep.

403
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:52,300
You said you had a girlfriend.

404
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,053
If anything,
you would've gone out on a date.

405
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,347
We went out the day before.

406
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,933
I need a day to rest.

407
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,102
It was my day off too.

408
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,690
You don't know who I am, do you?

409
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,610
This is you. I know it is.

410
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,488
Do you have evidence?

411
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,492
If you don't, you have to believe me.

412
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,669
The dead karaoke bar employee

413
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:31,589
found on that hill
was probably killed by him too, right?

414
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:32,924
I believe so.

415
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,510
The dead body had traces of rape too.

416
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:38,555
We must get him to confess
to the sexual assault too.

417
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,017
How did he seem?
Is he a little different now?

418
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,145
He did not show any emotional distress.

419
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,940
He seemed rather calm
in a startling situation.

420
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,401
It looks like he has
an antisocial personality disorder.

421
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:52,694
Like a psychopath?

422
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:56,239
-Yes.
-Someone extremely self-centered,

423
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,659
who lacks a sense of sympathy

424
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:01,953
and a guilty conscience.

425
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:05,373
It looked like he kept two dogs.

426
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,250
It's probably a cover-up.

427
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:10,754
<i>I'm sure he only used them
to lure the victims.</i>

428
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:13,631
Let's conduct the PCL-R on him later.

429
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,634
He seems to be the type
to show aggression selectively.

430
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:17,802
What do you mean?

431
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:21,348
People like him have
a high level of self-control.

432
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,641
They keep their composure until the moment

433
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:26,227
of their crime.
They won't show their emotions.

434
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,188
But once he begins to attack,

435
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,441
he becomes more brutal
and violent than others.

436
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,736
Are you saying
he picks and chooses his victims?

437
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:35,904
You're right.

438
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,572
Gu Young-chun and Nam Ki-Tae

439
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:41,284
expressed their aggression
toward many unspecified people.

440
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,620
But that man

441
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:46,623
only expresses his aggression
toward the victims he chose.

442
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,378
I think we should be more strategic
about our interrogation tactics.

443
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:56,257
Even if we show him evidence,
he won't confess that easily.

444
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,093
Chief Kook and I will interrogate him.

445
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,435
Two gentlemen are joining me this time.

446
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,897
Are you here
to have a conversation with me?

447
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,358
That's right.

448
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:18,530
What about
the other detectives from earlier?

449
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,407
You'll be talking to us for a while.

450
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,869
I told you to get evidence.

451
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,247
I guess it's not going well.

452
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,668
Gosh.

453
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,089
If you wanted to talk to me,

454
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,884
you should have at least
brought me some water.

455
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,177
Is that all you need?

456
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:48,601
We're here to talk to you.

457
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,770
But we're not here to bring you water.

458
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:54,274
Let us know once you actually get thirsty.

459
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,651
I'll get you some water then.

460
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,614
What are they doing?

461
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:06,202
Just let them do their thing.
They have their own system.

462
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:10,623
His attitude seems
a bit different from before.

463
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:11,708
Whose attitude?

464
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,878
-Song Ha-young's?
-Yes.

465
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,379
Rightfully so.

466
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,174
After all, he went through a lot.

467
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,472
<i>This guy is different.</i>

468
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,017
<i>He probably subdued the victims
in a matter of seconds</i>

469
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,977
<i>and clouded their emotional judgment.</i>

470
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,188
<i>Then he probably continued his act</i>

471
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:36,858
<i>just like he was trying to have
a power struggle by making me bring water.</i>

472
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,072
I've been sitting here

473
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:45,950
and talking to the detectives
since I got here.

474
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,744
What else do you want to talk about?

475
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,871
We have our own set of questions.

476
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,206
If you have time for this,

477
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:55,376
wouldn't it be better spent
looking for evidence outside?

478
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,505
All you're doing is sitting here…

479
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,092
and running your mouth.

480
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,804
We're looking for evidence.
So don't worry about it.

481
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,639
All right. If you say so.

482
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,516
It won't take long to find evidence.

483
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:14,687
Why is that jerk so brazen?

484
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:17,941
You know denying their charges
shamelessly is their specialty.

485
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,609
According to Chief Kook,

486
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,486
his self-control is very high.

487
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:26,032
And it looks like he's trying
to control his emotions even now.

488
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:28,827
He asked for water as soon as he saw them

489
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,955
to test whether or not
he could control them.

490
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,082
Does he think he can intimidate them?

491
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:35,959
How dare he?

492
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,211
Let me ask you a few questions.

493
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,214
Your wife and mother-in-law died

494
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,633
in a fire a few years ago.

495
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:48,388
And you only took your son
when you escaped.

496
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:52,934
When you think about it again,
how do you feel?

497
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,694
Why must I think about that now?

498
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:06,406
I'm just asking how you feel
or what you're thinking right now.

499
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:07,991
I don't know

500
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,912
how the fire has anything
to do with this incident.

501
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,083
Why are you bringing up my son?

502
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,252
Your son?

503
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:25,091
I wonder how your son would feel
once he finds out that his dad is

504
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,093
a serial murderer and rapist.

505
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:30,722
You see,

506
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,766
he's too young to know anything.

507
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,643
Not yet.

508
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,105
No. Listen.

509
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,108
Nothing has been proven yet.

510
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,236
I really don't follow you.

511
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,114
That's right.

512
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,491
"Not yet."

513
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,746
You received a hefty sum of money

514
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,206
from the insurance claim.

515
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,959
Are you

516
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,670
suspecting me right now?

517
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,965
You see, the fire…

518
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:13,181
started because of
the mosquito incense stick.

519
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,226
And the detectives
who investigated the case…

520
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,105
couldn't prove anything.

521
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,735
"Couldn't" prove anything?

522
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:29,280
Right.

523
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,574
They couldn't prove anything.

524
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,494
Because there was nothing to prove.
Isn't that obvious?

525
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:39,540
I was trying
to survive the fire with my son.

526
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,837
All we did was escape. That's all.

527
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:45,838
I mean…

528
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,466
we didn't say otherwise, did we?

529
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,722
Why did you send your son
to your cousin's house?

530
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,270
Once I go to work,

531
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,316
there's no one to look after him.

532
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,902
How old is your son? Is he 11 years old?

533
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,949
Why are you curious about that?

534
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:16,327
I was just wondering
if you know your son's age.

535
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,372
Don't be absurd.

536
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,416
Don't be rude.

537
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,919
Do you want your son to find out

538
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,296
that his father
is a serial murderer and rapist?

539
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:35,972
That jerk.

540
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,606
Why are you doing this to me?

541
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,191
I'm sure you know why.

542
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,318
Let's stop talking about my son.

543
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,404
Why? You don't like it?
Is it uncomfortable?

544
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,907
It has nothing to do with this case.

545
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,659
You said you didn't do it.

546
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,203
But you're still ashamed
when you think about your son?

547
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,000
I'm curious too.

548
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,335
Why is he bringing up his son?

549
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,921
Woo Ho-sung's narcissism.

550
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,841
HAVING ATTACHMENT TO ONESELF

551
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:14,927
Serial murderers and rapists
who commit crimes for pleasure

552
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,722
like Woo Ho-sung
will show a high level of narcissism.

553
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,640
He did seem to be full of himself.

554
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,893
People tend to develop
excessive self-attachment

555
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:25,271
as a defense mechanism
against pain and despair.

556
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,482
And when they experience
an attachment injury,

557
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,358
they feel a sense of humiliation
and hopelessness.

558
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:32,570
So the attachment toward others
gets directed to themselves.

559
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,572
A sense of humiliation and hopelessness?

560
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,282
That can cause narcissism?

561
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:38,951
They must deny their reality
that they can't be loved.

562
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:42,789
How can we get Woo Ho-sung to talk?

563
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:48,544
We need to find out the target
of his unconditional attachment.

564
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,797
Unconditional attachment?

565
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,590
It has to be his family, right?

566
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,759
-His parents or kids.
-It can't be his parents.

567
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,678
Having a big trauma
like an attachment injury

568
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,139
must mean that
he didn't feel loved by his parents.

569
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,516
Then it has to be his kids.

570
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,767
Does he have kids?

571
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,979
He has a son in elementary school.

572
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,648
His cousin is looking after him.

573
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,153
Fine. If not your son,
how about your parents?

574
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,738
Why do you keep…

575
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,699
trying to talk about

576
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:20,993
my personal life?

577
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,162
That's why we're here.

578
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,000
We analyze criminal behavior.

579
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,212
CHIEF KOOK YOUNG-SOO

580
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:34,048
You haven't proven…

581
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,093
anything yet.

582
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,931
I really don't understand…

583
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,601
what you're talking about.

584
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,313
-How was your relationship with your dad?
-My dad?

585
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,567
-He was strict.
-Did he hit you too?

586
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,484
No.

587
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,444
He never hit me.

588
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,363
Was your family well-off?

589
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,865
Why do you ask?

590
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:02,702
Do you think I had a tough upbringing
and grew up in poverty?

591
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,370
This is a standard question.

592
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:07,373
Gosh. You guys are unbelievable.

593
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:10,751
You guys are biased against people.

594
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:14,046
Enough with these ridiculous questions.

595
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,256
Go out there…

596
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:18,092
and find more evidence.

597
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:19,844
You just wait.

598
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,637
It won't be long.

599
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,891
Gosh. That jerk.

600
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,059
How's the search going?

601
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,769
He has a lot of stuff.

602
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,230
And he especially has a lot of clothes.

603
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:35,026
<i>That's not an excuse.
We have to bring everything in.</i>

604
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,450
Whenever we tried to provoke him,

605
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,452
he kept asking us
if we found any evidence.

606
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,579
He thinks he got rid of all the evidence.

607
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,206
What about his call history?

608
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,208
We used his call history since February

609
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,877
and tracked his whereabouts
with his cell phone

610
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,962
to check the security footage as we speak.

611
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,881
Gosh. It will take forever.

612
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,466
No news from the NFS, right?

613
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,051
There's too much stuff from his house.

614
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,969
So it will take a long time
just to run the DNA tests on them.

615
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,846
He set his car on fire for a reason.

616
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,640
He formatted his computer too.

617
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,684
Gosh. We just need some hard evidence
to make the arrest.

618
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,771
He seemed experienced in starting a fire.

619
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:14,398
Serial killers often commit arson too.

620
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,359
Every single one of them started a fire.

621
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:21,239
We'll have to check a few more things,
but I'm sure he's the culprit.

622
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,784
He said the police
"couldn't" prove anything.

623
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:27,286
Wait. His response is wrong.

624
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,871
He shouldn't say
the police couldn't prove it.

625
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,957
He should be arguing that he was innocent.

626
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,918
He killed his wife and mother-in-law?
No human can do this.

627
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:37,505
Listen. Are you telling me
the only thing we can do right now is

628
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,883
sit around this table
and wait for a call from the NFS?

629
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,804
We have 32 hours left.

630
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,058
You can eat now.

631
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,437
What is this?

632
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,856
You should've asked me first.

633
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,193
I don't eat <i>jjajangmyeon</i>.

634
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,153
It's bad for your health.

635
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,781
-What?
-I want a proper meal.

636
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:05,700
With soybean paste soup.

637
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,368
Or with <i>cheonggukjang</i> stew.

638
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,922
What? It's bad for your health?
He's unbelievable.

639
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:24,552
Why are these scumbags
all so health-conscious?

640
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,971
Who else was like that
other than Nam Ki-Tae?

641
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,431
Gu Young-chun.

642
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:31,976
Those scumbags
can live long lives in prison.

643
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,894
I'll go feed Woo Ho-sung.

644
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,104
-Okay.
-See you in a bit.

645
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,397
-See you.
-See you.

646
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,618
<i>Let's resume the interview with him
after he's done eating.</i>

647
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,037
-Okay.
-Sounds good.

648
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,623
While we're eating, let's think
about his MO from his perspective.

649
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,585
-From Woo Ho-sung's perspective?
-Yes.

650
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:00,755
He used his expensive car
to lure his victims.

651
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,549
<i>The victims got into his car
without suspecting anything.</i>

652
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,426
<i>For that to happen,</i>

653
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,887
there are various conditions
that had to be met.

654
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,056
<i>He must've cared a lot about what he wore.</i>

655
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,808
<i>Yes, they found a ton of clothes
at his house.</i>

656
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,602
<i>Clothes that look expensive.</i>

657
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,771
Winter clothes that he must've worn often.

658
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,898
We should check those first.
It'll be faster.

659
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:20,858
He lured his victims inside his vehicle,

660
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,485
so maybe not thick winter jackets.

661
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:24,612
He most likely wore
expensive-looking clothes.

662
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:28,157
Let's check neutral-colored
shirts and jackets first.

663
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,200
Why does the color matter?

664
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,952
Strangers wearing neutral colors
tend to seem more trustworthy

665
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,162
than those in loud colors.

666
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,707
That's right. This way, we can save time.

667
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:40,086
Start with clothes
that he probably wore often.

668
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:44,465
Neutral-colored winter shirts and jackets
that look expensive.

669
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,967
We ordered you what you wanted to eat,

670
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,929
so it's now your turn to give us
the answer we want.

671
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,350
You little punk, you're really something.

672
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:57,353
I'm getting sleepy now that I've eaten.

673
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:00,314
All right, let's get this done fast.

674
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,317
That's exactly
what we're trying to do now.

675
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,568
You punk.

676
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,613
Are you here for fun?

677
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:08,614
Look, Detective.

678
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:12,243
You arrested me without a warrant
based on mere suspicion. Am I wrong?

679
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,497
-What?
-And you're treating me like dirt.

680
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,750
What if I'm not the culprit?

681
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:23,921
What if

682
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:26,966
I sue you?

683
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:29,635
What will you do then?

684
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:31,762
You little punk, you have a knack

685
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,848
for getting people riled up.

686
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:34,849
Chief Park.

687
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,643
-Let go. You piece of…
-Chief Park, please.

688
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,187
You'd better confess

689
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:43,941
when you still have the chance to
or you'll regret it later, you punk.

690
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,444
I'm scared.

691
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,197
Darn it.

692
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:53,367
That scumbag is so confident.

693
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,328
What did the NFS say?

694
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,664
I asked them to check
his winter clothes first.

695
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:00,166
Darn it.

696
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:03,335
If we find the victims' DNA,
it's a done deal.

697
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,129
Let's wait and see.

698
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:07,339
People like him open up easily to those

699
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:10,426
who are either younger than them
or have low-level positions.

700
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,220
It's one of the common traits
of a narcissist.

701
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,555
Correct.

702
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,308
They want to feel supported
and acknowledged.

703
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:21,145
We shouldn't make him feel inferior.

704
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:25,149
Then should Detective Nam
deal with him without Chief Park?

705
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,735
Let's wait and see.

706
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,869
You killed this woman.

707
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:39,580
Take your time and have a look.

708
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,804
Can I get a cup of coffee?

709
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:58,098
Go ahead.

710
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,324
Looks like he'll confess, right?

711
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,035
Either that
or he just felt a pang of guilt.

712
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,912
He did show a reaction at that moment,

713
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,790
but we'll have to wait and see
what he does.

714
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,125
He's been denying everything
this whole time.

715
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:28,087
He won't be swayed that easily
only by the victims' photos.

716
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:32,633
But he's human after all.

717
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:36,095
Based on his attitude so far,
I know he won't confess easily.

718
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:41,559
And he managed to be cleared
of the insurance scam charges.

719
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:16,760
These women aren't even recognizable.

720
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,887
What do you want me to do
with these photos?

721
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:23,183
That scumbag is clearly a psychopath.

722
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,103
Why did he put the cup
on top of the photo?

723
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,024
Of course, he wasn't going to confess.

724
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,737
"These women aren't even recognizable."

725
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,031
What is it?

726
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,116
They're photos of one victim.

727
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:42,036
It's not the owner of the debit card
he used to withdraw money.

728
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,621
It's the karaoke bar employee

729
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:46,165
who was found dead in the woods.

730
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,674
He should be under the impression

731
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:58,093
that it's the victim
we're accusing him of killing.

732
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,430
But he assumed that

733
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:03,223
it'd be more than one person.

734
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,435
What? Then…

735
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:08,354
It means there is more than one victim.

736
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,606
He's the culprit.

737
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,363
He killed several women.

738
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,407
Hence the reaction.

739
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,784
If he didn't do it,

740
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:26,121
he'd know nothing about the victim
or the location.

741
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:31,126
So the fact that he said
he couldn't recognize them…

742
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:33,587
is certainly odd.

743
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,400
I found something.

744
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:58,654
What did you eat?

745
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:00,239
Pizza.

746
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,622
Here it is.

747
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:11,542
DNA INFORMATION LAB

748
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:14,253
-Good morning.
-Did you work all night?

749
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:17,214
-Look.
-What?

750
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:18,507
NFS HAN BONG-AM

751
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:19,425
The NFS?

752
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:23,762
Goodness, they pulled an all-nighter too.

753
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:26,390
Hey.

754
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,685
Yes, okay.

755
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:31,770
What is it?

756
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:35,274
They found a bloodstain
on Woo Ho-sung's jacket.

757
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:39,611
The DNA matches that
of the body found in the woods.

758
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:43,866
Finally, thank goodness.

759
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:45,701
You're dead meat now, you punk.

760
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:48,454
Also, they found a half-burnt lipstick

761
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:50,789
in the burnt vehicle.

762
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,167
-Did they manage to lift DNA?
-Not yet.

763
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,877
I just wanted to keep you informed.

764
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,379
I'll go in and let them know.

765
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,047
They've faxed the report.

766
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:02,092
-Okay.
-Good work, everyone.

767
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:04,928
What would we have done without you guys?

768
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:08,515
What is it, Ha-young?

769
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:10,225
The lipstick.

770
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:13,854
Maybe it belongs to a victim
we don't know about yet.

771
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:16,273
We need to get a confession out of him.

772
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,925
Goodness.

773
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,346
We found something.

774
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,099
This is what
we've been eagerly waiting for.

775
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,018
DNA ANALYSIS REPORT

776
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:54,061
The evidence.

777
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:57,189
It's the victim's DNA…

778
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:00,108
that we found from your clothes.

779
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:02,986
We found it.

780
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,404
BELONGS TO THE SAME PERSON

781
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,215
HEO GEUM-YOUNG

782
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,343
WORKS AT YEONJIN CHINESE RESTAURANT

783
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:28,262
HEO GEUM-YOUNG, 51

784
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,430
{\an8}SPECIMEN 1 AND 2 BELONG TO THE SAME PERSON

785
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,182
Captain Yoon, the one who just left.

786
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,270
Ask her to come in.

787
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:41,650
Stop trying to conjure up a trick.
Just confess, you scumbag.

788
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:44,945
I will confess.

789
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:48,073
In return,

790
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,703
I want Captain Yoon here.

791
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:56,540
I'll go get a confession out of him.

792
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:58,750
Hold on.

793
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:00,836
I'll go in first.

794
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:05,257
-You?
-I want to say something to Woo Ho-sung.

795
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:09,553
-It'll be quick.
-Sure, go ahead.

796
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:12,014
-Will you be all right?
-Yes.

797
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,266
I'll go in myself.

798
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:29,239
How do you feel?

799
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:33,285
About what?

800
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:35,245
You have nowhere to run now.

801
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,331
You're good at finding evidence.

802
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:40,083
Science is much smarter than you think.

803
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:42,919
So is the quality of our investigation.

804
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:47,132
That perfect crime you want?
There's no such thing.

805
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:50,385
Woo Ho-sung.

806
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:55,474
-Be smart about it.
-About what?

807
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:57,142
Whether or not
you want your son to remember you

808
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:59,227
as an unremorseful murderer
until the very end.

809
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,147
And this will be the last time we talk.

810
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,776
I'm not scared.

811
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:07,611
I'm not saying this to scare you.

812
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:12,407
I'm telling you that
nobody will listen to your story anymore.

813
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:16,620
I already know
that there are multiple victims.

814
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,372
We have the evidence too.

815
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,959
I thought you weren't here
to talk about the case.

816
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:25,671
-I'm not.
-Then let's change the subject.

817
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:28,715
No. I already have you figured out.

818
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,137
Which is why I'm no longer curious.

819
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:08,088
Would it be possible…

820
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:12,801
for me to talk privately
with Captain Yoon?

821
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:17,597
I'll be fine.

822
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:21,852
Give me your hands.

823
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:36,074
What is it that you want to say?

824
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,202
I'm sure…

825
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:42,622
getting a confession out of someone

826
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,627
is harder
than you detectives think, right?

827
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:51,381
It's the same for the confessor too.

828
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:53,967
Which is why…

829
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:55,927
I'm torn.

830
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,267
<i>Whether the culprit confesses or not</i>

831
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,770
is his decision to make.

832
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:05,979
Then how…

833
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,316
can I get him to decide?

834
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,527
Just give the nuance
that you understand him to an extent.

835
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:15,155
Woo Ho-sung
has strong narcissistic tendencies.

836
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:17,240
If you form a rapport with him,

837
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:19,993
it'll bring about a change
in his emotions.

838
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:23,288
Don't you think…

839
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:28,502
the burden will be lifted
once you confess?

840
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:30,921
Whose burden?

841
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,088
Yours.

842
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:34,508
And mine too.

843
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,093
Do you really think so?

844
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:38,970
I'm sure…

845
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:43,183
you had a reason
why you asked for me specifically.

846
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:48,438
Whatever it is that you have to tell me,

847
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,441
I'm ready to listen

848
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:53,902
to you.

849
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:06,623
Why did you do it?

850
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:14,881
Must there always…

851
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,051
be a reason

852
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,097
why you kill someone?

853
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,183
So…

854
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,520
you didn't have a reason?

855
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:31,648
Well, if I had to come up with one,

856
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:37,654
it's because I wanted to kill them.

857
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:39,698
How many…

858
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:41,616
did you murder?

859
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:46,913
We found…

860
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:50,500
components of another victim's lipstick

861
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,086
from your car.

862
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:56,590
It will all be revealed in the end.

863
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:04,681
That hand.

864
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,976
You tried your best to hide your face.

865
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:09,269
But unfortunately,

866
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:12,939
you weren't able to hide your hand.

867
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:21,740
You've been self-conscious
about it all along, right?

868
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:27,454
Once you are ready to talk to me,

869
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,167
I'll come back.

870
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:38,590
All right.

871
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:46,014
I will talk.

872
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:04,908
<i>The suspect confessed
that he murdered all the women</i>

873
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:08,912
<i>who started going missing in 2006
around Gyeonggi's southwestern area.</i>

874
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:12,582
<i>Early this morning in Suwon, the police
found the body of the missing housewife.</i>

875
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,960
<i>They are continuing their search
for the other women's bodies…</i>

876
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,461
Is this hair?

877
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,756
Oh, I found it!

878
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,716
-What?
-I found something.

879
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,717
Look.

880
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:24,970
<i>On the day I planned to murder,</i>

881
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:28,682
I made sure that I executed it.

882
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,644
No matter what.

883
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:36,106
You're saying you planned
for all seven murders?

884
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,357
Of course.

885
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,694
I'm determined from the moment

886
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:43,196
I leave the house.

887
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:45,573
Did you ever fail?

888
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:47,450
Fail?

889
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:50,495
I have never failed.

890
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:53,248
You see,

891
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,626
it's like a promise I make to myself.

892
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:01,047
I executed it.

893
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:05,093
One way or another.

894
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:08,346
<i>The police intensely investigated
the suspect to find out</i>

895
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:12,851
<i>if he committed additional crimes
until early this morning.</i>

896
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:16,146
<i>They will also carry out
a crime scene reenactment this morning.</i>

897
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:17,147
Look over here.

898
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:21,776
<i>He reenacted three
out of his seven crimes yesterday.</i>

899
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,654
<i>The bereaved families and residents
were enraged once again</i>

900
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:27,949
<i>as they watched him
reenact the crime nonchalantly.</i>

901
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:30,910
<i>I have always known…</i>

902
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:33,913
that I was a psychopath.

903
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,541
Why did you think that?

904
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:38,918
I was watching TV one day.

905
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:42,213
When I heard

906
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,716
the characteristics of a psychopath…

907
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:48,428
I realized.

908
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:52,849
That's me in a nutshell.

909
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,562
Take his hat off. Let me see him!

910
00:55:57,645 --> 00:55:59,397
-My gosh.
-That scumbag…

911
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:03,234
<i>His second crime was by Highway 39,
which was his secret burial site.</i>

912
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:05,612
<i>When the police told him
to reenact how he dug the ground,</i>

913
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:08,031
<i>he was comfortable enough
to revise the order.</i>

914
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:10,575
<i>Saying that he dug the ground
after he took the body out of the car.</i>

915
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:13,912
<i>His calm demeanor
as he reenacted the horrible crime</i>

916
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:16,289
<i>made the onlookers even more furious.</i>

917
00:56:16,372 --> 00:56:19,751
<i>The bereaved families who came later
to watch the reenactment</i>

918
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:22,337
<i>were crying out,
demanding to see his face.</i>

919
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:26,299
When do you feel the urge to kill?

920
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:33,181
That is…

921
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:38,728
a little difficult to describe

922
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:41,147
with words.

923
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:46,569
Hitting on women is a piece of cake.

924
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:48,988
You see, those girls…

925
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:51,366
They all liked me.

926
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:54,619
I'm not sure.

927
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,080
I think it's just you.

928
00:56:57,163 --> 00:57:00,125
Why won't you believe me? It's true.

929
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:03,378
They all really liked me.

930
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:04,671
I also think…

931
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:08,967
you only look like a petty loser.

932
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:10,718
Sorry for the bad news.

933
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:12,887
We…

934
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,265
do not…

935
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,685
believe your words.

936
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,605
If they don't listen to me,

937
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:24,274
then…

938
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,193
I take off

939
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:33,116
my necktie and bind their hands and feet.

940
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:35,452
<i>The investigation headquarters
of the Gyeonggi Agency stated</i>

941
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:37,287
<i>they received the confession from Woo,</i>

942
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,747
<i>the suspect who killed
the female university student</i>

943
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:42,834
<i>who went missing in February,
that he killed seven and buried them</i>

944
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:44,002
<i>until early this year.</i>

945
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,671
<i>Last month,</i>

946
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:49,257
<i>he conducted two psychopathy tests</i>

947
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:54,721
<i>and was confirmed as a typical psychopath
with scores of 27 and 28 respectively.</i>

948
00:57:57,891 --> 00:57:58,975
I will be

949
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:01,936
sentenced to death, right?

950
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:04,272
You should be.

951
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,574
Even after I go up there, I won't find

952
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,118
my peace.

953
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:20,413
Did you dream of ending up in heaven?

954
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:38,431
Goodness, Ji-sook.

955
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:41,893
Ji-sook, you've returned in such vain.

956
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:04,040
Let's go.

957
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:13,341
GYEONGGI INVESTIGATION HEADQUARTERS
OF SERIAL MISSING WOMEN CASE

958
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:17,220
Gil-pyo.

959
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:18,930
A souvenir.

960
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:25,520
Park Dae-woong! Big bear! You did it!

961
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:26,729
Thank you.

962
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:29,983
Good work, everyone.

963
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,609
-Great job.
-Great work.

964
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:34,821
It's sad to see you go.

965
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:37,031
You don't look too sad.

966
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:38,449
Tell me about it.

967
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:40,493
Well, I may not look sad,

968
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,620
but I'm glad and sad to see you go.

969
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:43,788
We'll visit.

970
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:45,582
It only takes us 50 minutes
to get here from Seoul Agency…

971
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,458
I don't expect you to come.

972
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:50,128
You're one to talk.
I don't expect you to come either.

973
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:53,214
If we have to meet again,
it'll have to be another case…

974
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:55,008
Goodness, no.

975
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:57,093
In that case, I'd rather not meet at all.

976
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:59,721
Let's just keep our memories
deep inside, right here.

977
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:02,599
Captain Yoon,
you should also share something.

978
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:11,816
Let's go now.

979
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,652
-Great work.
-Great job.

980
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:17,572
-Chief Park, let's have some soju.
-Let's do that.

981
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:18,781
Stay healthy, okay?

982
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:20,617
Yes, be mindful of your health too.

983
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:21,993
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

984
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:25,413
-Let's go.
-Great job.

985
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:38,801
Why are you moving on a day when I'm free?

986
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:41,012
Because I moved to the neighborhood
you told me to.

987
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:43,931
I can't move here
because there are lots of robberies.

988
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:46,684
Another place is too dangerous
because of burglars.

989
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:49,187
When I see you,
I realize knowing too much can hurt.

990
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:51,272
Thanks to me,
you came to a safe neighborhood.

991
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:54,192
According to statistics,
this area has 50 percent fewer crimes

992
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:55,860
compared to other neighborhoods.

993
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:58,780
And a detective of the Wide-Area
Investigation Squad is your neighbor.

994
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:00,615
So when will Detective Nam get here?

995
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:02,659
-Detective Nam?
-Yes.

996
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:05,370
I have your order of beef intestines.

997
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:07,830
-These are all mine?
-Yes.

998
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:13,461
My gosh, this is a lot. All right.

999
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:15,588
-Goodbye.
-Thank you.

1000
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:18,216
Goodbye.

1001
01:01:26,974 --> 01:01:30,353
When did you get all these?

1002
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:32,271
-I had to run.
-That looks good.

1003
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:33,606
Detective Nam got these?

1004
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,525
You can get beef intestines to go?

1005
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:37,318
Yes, you can get
just about anything to go now.

1006
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,570
It's much more convenient
since it's already cooked.

1007
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:41,322
It's really good.

1008
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:42,782
-Is it?
-Yes, try some.

1009
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:44,701
Let's make a toast first.

1010
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:47,120
Congratulations.

1011
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:52,959
This is how I recharge
the energy I lost from moving.

1012
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:05,930
The mood here is perfect.

1013
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:08,015
Let's get together from time to time

1014
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:09,976
and have meetings here.

1015
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:11,769
-It'd be nice.
-Sounds great.

1016
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:13,896
I got it.

1017
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,358
Isn't this the first time we got together
outside of work?

1018
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:19,318
-You're right.
-Is that so?

1019
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:23,239
-Oh my.
-The moon is so pretty.

1020
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:27,910
-Yes, it's huge.
-That's very pretty.

1021
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:29,370
-Yes.
-Right.

1022
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:32,290
Then let's all make a wish together.

1023
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:35,877
Woo-ju, your drinking habit
is making a wish to the moon, right?

1024
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,254
-You're right on.
-My gosh.

1025
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:41,340
If Woo-ju wants to do that,
then let's make a wish.

1026
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,470
You make wishes like that?

1027
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:48,681
Then how?

1028
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:52,268
I'm all done.

1029
01:02:56,647 --> 01:02:59,567
MARCH 2007

1030
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:02,153
Who are you trying to look good for?

1031
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:04,906
Who do you think?
The future members of the Analysis Team.

1032
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:08,201
-Aren't you excited?
-Why should I be?

1033
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:11,204
You should start looking at people

1034
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:13,372
other than me.

1035
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,457
Good grief.

1036
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,168
You should stop digging my nagging.

1037
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:20,087
You need to share your love
with these future members.

1038
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:22,381
Let me off right over there.

1039
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:25,718
Forget it. It's a special day,
so let's get our hair done.

1040
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,386
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

1041
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:30,389
Recently, vitamin care
is received greatly by our customers.

1042
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:31,891
-What do you think?
-Really?

1043
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:34,018
This is perfect for us.

1044
01:03:34,101 --> 01:03:35,937
Then let's do this one.

1045
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:37,188
-Okay.
-All right.

1046
01:03:37,271 --> 01:03:39,357
-We'll do this.
-Sure.

1047
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:47,240
Do you drink a lot?

1048
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,908
How did you know?

1049
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:51,744
This is a care routine we recommend
to those who drink often

1050
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,371
and have bad blood circulation.

1051
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:56,332
For those who are stressed
and need to be refreshed.

1052
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:58,876
That already feels nice.

1053
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,294
-Chief Kook.
-Yes?

1054
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:01,420
Does it feel good?

1055
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:02,672
It feels very refreshing.

1056
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:05,508
Ha-young, you should do it too.

1057
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:10,012
Someone said a person's heart
is the most difficult thing to fathom.

1058
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:13,266
But there are those
who must do such difficult work.

1059
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:15,268
On top of that,

1060
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:18,521
they must fathom the hearts of criminals,
not just any old person.

1061
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:20,940
<i>At times,
among countless numbers of criminals,</i>

1062
01:04:21,732 --> 01:04:23,442
<i>they must put up a fight</i>

1063
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:26,863
<i>to read the minds of serial killers,
who are the worst evil of them all.</i>

1064
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:30,032
And these people are none other than you.

1065
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:34,036
Someone once said an angel
is only a hair different from a devil.

1066
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:37,331
Most minds that live an ordinary life,

1067
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:41,002
and the most atrocious minds
that commit heinous murders.

1068
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:43,296
Where did they cross their paths?

1069
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:48,509
What made these people so wicked?

1070
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:52,263
Our duty begins with that basic question.

1071
01:04:52,346 --> 01:04:54,140
In this chaotic world

1072
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:56,601
and dramatic reality,

1073
01:04:57,518 --> 01:04:59,729
the only thing that keeps us
from becoming evil

1074
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:04,734
might be our ability
to touch people's hearts.

1075
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:09,530
I hope your duty becomes another chance

1076
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:13,326
to revisit the preciousness
and the importance of that ability.

1077
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:15,745
I hope you will

1078
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:18,789
learn to embrace your own hearts.

1079
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:21,709
Through this duty,

1080
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:24,337
I also had the chance

1081
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:26,839
to have priceless experiences

1082
01:05:28,132 --> 01:05:31,135
and to realize
these important values in life.

1087

1088
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:59,348
<i>before we wrap up the interview?</i>

1089
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:00,474
<i>Well…</i>

1090
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:05,229
<i>We have yet to catch the culprit
in the Daesung Serial Murder Case.</i>

1091
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:07,815
<i>And if he's watching the show right now,</i>

1092
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:10,317
<i>I would like to say this to him.</i>

1093
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:13,237
Science is making progress day by day.

1094
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:15,906
And there's no perfect crime
in this world.

1095
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:19,702
So you'll never get away with this.

OF VIOLENT CRIMES EVERY YEAR

WE WOULD LIKE TO PRAY
FOR THE SOULS OF THE VICTIMS

MAY OUR SOCIETY BE SAFE
AND PROTECTED FROM CRIMES

1104
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:51,942
MAY PEOPLE PAY ATTENTION
