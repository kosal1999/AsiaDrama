00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:11,529
JANE DOE

2
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,886
I always had to do this alone.

3
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,305
But the three of you joined me today.

4
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,558
-Thank you for coming.
-There's no need to thank us.

5
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,561
I'm sure all the victims were loved
when they were born.

6
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:47,482
But seeing how we couldn't even
put a name to these victims

7
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:48,733
makes me sad.

8
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:52,195
So people don't come here.

9
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,489
Thank you for coming today.

10
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,786
These victims faced a bitter end
after a life of hard work.

11
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:03,665
Please help them,
so they could be happy over there.

12
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,626
And give Gu Young-chun
a taste of his own medicine.

13
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:11,339
To someone like Gu Young-chun,
that's too generous of a punishment.

14
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,553
I heard that

15
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:20,348
Captain Yoon has been tirelessly working
to find the victims' families.

16
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,559
I didn't think she'd come here.

17
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,104
<i>Captain Yoon</i>

18
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,189
<i>isn't cutting her hair for the victims.</i>

19
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,441
<i>Why her hair?</i>

20
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,111
<i>She thinks the inconvenience
of having long hair</i>

21
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,113
<i>is what she can do to mourn.</i>

22
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,283
<i>I guess having this sense of guiltâ€¦</i>

23
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,952
<i>comes with our job.</i>

24
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,046
<i>Learning from the unprecedented case</i>

25
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,132
which resulted in countless victims,

26
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,551
we see the need to set up

27
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:59,554
a comprehensive, government-wide solution
for the public safety.

28
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:03,808
To prevent from making the same mistake
in the future,

29
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,270
we will put together
an investigation manual

30
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,730
based on Gu Young-chun's case.

31
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:12,692
We are setting up the structure,
so everyone can be informed.

32
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,403
Moreover,

33
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,323
police officers
who committed grave mistakes

34
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,367
<i>while investigating the serial killer,
Gu Young-chun,</i>

35
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,370
<i>were reprimanded to a great extent.</i>

36
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,372
<i>With this momentum,</i>

37
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,334
<i>we'll solve the unsolved cases
of violent crimes by this year.</i>

38
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,170
<i>And we will do our best</i>

39
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,298
<i>to keep our people safe.</i>

40
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,426
Good luck.

41
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:50,271
As you all know, we'll be studying
Gu Young-chun's case.

42
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,357
The serial killer we recently apprehended.

43
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,194
The public and the higher-ups
are criticizing us

44
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,655
that we didn't catch the killer
soon enough.

45
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,531
It's not like we're not trying.

46
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,783
That's right.

47
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,952
He hid and didn't leave any evidence.

48
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:07,497
-What were we supposed to do with him?
-I know that it's a hassle.

49
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,832
But we've never had someone
like Gu Young-chun.

50
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,460
If we'd caught Gu Young-chun sooner,

51
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,672
we wouldn't have this many victims.

52
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,341
Was there a problem
with the initial investigation?

53
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,634
There was.

54
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,844
The incidents took place
in different areas.

55
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,930
The investigations were done
by different stations.

56
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,474
And putting together the information
took a long time.

57
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,685
If we were to reorganize the protocol,

58
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,436
so we can investigate initially,

59
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,356
we might be able to lessen the confusion.

60
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,565
Great. What else?

61
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,319
After Gu Young-chun killed
the wealthy elderly,

62
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,154
he changed his MO.

63
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:44,200
Despite receiving multiple
missing persons reports on our victims,

64
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,494
they were categorized
as simple runaway cases.

65
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:49,163
It's not possible to file adults
missing in our system.

66
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:52,417
There were 11 missing women.

67
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,254
The fact that they were excluded
from our investigation is a problem.

68
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,508
And we should recognize that

69
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:04,554
our existing investigation method
didn't work.

70
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,390
Questioning the victim's acquaintances
and ex-convicts

71
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,434
is the first step of our investigation.

72
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,477
How could we ignore that?

73
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,896
I'm not saying we should ignore it.

74
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,023
Gu Young-chun's case.

75
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,941
It was confirmed he had no motives.

76
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,694
It's a crime we've never experienced.

77
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:24,115
Therefore, we need to accept
new investigation methods.

78
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:27,285
She has a point. I agree with her.

79
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,330
The report from the Analysis Team
was spot on once again.

80
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,916
However, it would be prudent for us

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,544
to also discuss the risk of only relying

82
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,755
on the behavioral analysis reports.

83
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,716
Here's the most ironic factor
of this case.

84
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,052
It was figuring out the murder weapon.

85
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,012
A hexagon-shaped steel hammer.

86
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,306
Why hadn't we thought of that?

87
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:51,517
No one uses a steel hammer to kill people.

88
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,810
That's why.

89
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,854
Gu Young-chun chose the steel hammer

90
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,564
to take down the victims easily.

91
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,484
In other words, killing was his sole goal.

92
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,237
By controlling his victims,
he showed off his power.

93
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,156
And he prepared for his killings.

94
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,492
-"Prepared"?
-I mentioned it earlier.

95
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,744
He improved a hammer
so the job would be easier.

96
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,956
He took a full-body X-ray to study
where the body should be severed.

97
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,500
Once he started killing,

98
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,837
the degree of desecration
gradually escalated.

99
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,380
So the preparations

100
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,674
and the act of desecration
gave him the thrill.

101
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,551
Correct.

102
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,930
So he's not the delusional type
who experiences hallucinations,

103
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,099
but I'm not sure
if he had a sense of mission.

104
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,892
I'd say he does exhibit the traits.

105
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:36,395
He did say he committed the murders
to root out social evils.

106
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,314
Using such preposterous logic,

107
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:40,566
he tried to justify what he did.

108
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,819
Power, influence, and money.

109
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,363
This world where the wealthy
get rich illegally,

110
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,865
women live promiscuously,

111
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,201
and civil servants live like bugs.

112
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,329
They all have to be punished!

113
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:54,872
Gu Young-chun.

114
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,418
<i>He could go on
about his "sense of mission."</i>

115
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,547
But essentially,
he purposely chose weak targets

116
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,173
whom he could take down easily.

117
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,217
He's just

118
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,803
a cowardly loser who's all talk.

119
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,725
I'll build a factory right here.

120
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,060
-Hey!
-Look!

121
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:18,855
Ta-da!

122
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,773
-Look, right here.
-Ye-won, Yu-hwa.

123
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,775
It's time to go home. Come on.

124
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,485
-Okay!
-Okay!

125
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:29,031
Ji-hwan, let's go home and eat.

126
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,324
Okay, Mom!

127
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:43,671
Jun, let's go home.

128
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,507
-Okay.
-What are you doing there alone?

129
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,675
Come on.

130
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,454
<i>Don't people like me
all have the same story?</i>

131
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,706
<i>An abusive father.</i>

132
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,251
<i>And a miserable childhood
with no one to lean on.</i>

133
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,755
<i>So do you blame your father?</i>

134
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,257
You've never lived with a father

135
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,301
who threatens you with a hammer
every time he gets drunk, right?

136
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,803
I never lived with my father.

137
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,889
He passed away the day I was born.

138
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,098
You're lucky.

139
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,310
It's better to not have one
than to grow up with a father like that.

140
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:40,728
No wonder I'm like this.

141
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,606
You think that's the reason?

142
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,067
I thought you were
a criminal behavioral analyst.

143
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:50,154
Didn't you hear such a childhood
could cause you to become a serial killer?

144
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,300
A cowardly way to justify himself.

145
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,181
I'm home.

146
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,391
You're late.

147
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,184
You're still up?

148
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,313
-Good night.
-You too.

149
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,864
Come in.

150
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:38,202
-You're still up?
-Yes.

151
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,454
-Here, have some.
-Thanks.

152
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,040
I guess I'm getting old.
I tossed and turned a little,

153
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,084
and I can't fall asleep anymore.

154
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,837
I made it today.
It turned out nicely. Try it.

155
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,880
Okay, thank you. Try to get some sleep.

156
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,773
What's with the booze?

157
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,443
He can't even drink.

158
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:15,323
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

159
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,241
You see, we never

160
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,952
agree to interview requests,

161
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:23,664
but he kept pestering us about it.

162
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,917
I didn't know
Woo-ju had such a cool friend.

163
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,879
What a pretty name. Reporter Choi Yoon-ji.

164
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,130
Here, have some coffee.

165
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,718
-Thank you.
-How nice is this?

166
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,095
Thanks to Reporter Choi,

167
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,306
we can sit down
and enjoy coffee in the office.

168
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,724
Cheers.

169
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,225
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

170
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,485
-It's good.
-It is.

171
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,030
As I mentioned last timeâ€¦

172
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,698
No pictures, please.

173
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:58,824
Oh, this.

174
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,494
It's like a soldier's weapon
on the battlefield.

175
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,746
I always have it with me wherever I go.

176
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,165
I won't be taking any pictures today.

177
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,501
It'll just be a story
that introduces the team.

178
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,212
My gosh, why am I nervous?

179
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,048
I feel like I'm being interrogated.

180
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,425
Relax. It'll be like a chat.

181
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,510
Okay, sounds good.

182
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:22,139
Here's what I was most curious about.

183
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,184
Common motives for murder

184
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,978
include money, lust, hatred,

185
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,939
and revenge, right?

186
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,524
That's right.

187
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,942
However, Gu Young-chun

188
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:36,487
is a serial murderer
who completely deviates from that.

189
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,740
What do you think is the reason behind

190
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,618
such motiveless murders?

191
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,412
Here's what I think.

192
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,497
Feelings of social isolation

193
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,166
have been on the rise,

194
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,377
and these brutal crimes

195
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,004
are manifestations of blind hatred
resulting from that.

196
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,382
-Blind hatred?
-Yes.

197
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,384
Profilers aren't psychics.

198
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,970
We analyze the psychological
and behavioral patterns of culprits

199
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,973
and assist in investigations
so they can be caught quickly.

200
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,809
We use accumulated data
to analyze such patterns.

201
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:10,354
<i>Interviewing other convicts
is a part of that.</i>

202
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,107
There are always traces
left at crime scenes.

203
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,360
And every murderer leaves a trail.
Their behaviors

204
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:20,448
show us what their motives are
and what they're trying to achieve.

205
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:24,201
That's right. Forensics

206
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,078
finds evidence at the scenes.

207
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,747
Profilers analyze the clues
and circumstantial evidence

208
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,000
based on our observations of the scenes.

209
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,171
We're analyzing the Southwest Case
at the moment.

210
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,133
I want to say this to the culprit
who will probably read this.

211
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:40,968
"We'll catch you soon."

212
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,762
I hope so too.

213
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,307
I can tell you this one thing for sure.

214
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,853
Perfect crime doesn't exist.

215
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,454
Way to go, Yoon-ji.

216
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:11,081
I always knew that you were so capable.

217
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,167
I'm so proud of you.

218
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,671
This article will be a hit.

219
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,381
I need to focus.

220
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,800
Oh, right. Sorry.

221
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,386
You know how important this article is.

222
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,222
Fix this typo, Yoon-ji.

226
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,816
He's not here.
You called the Special Crime Squad.

227
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,277
Hello?

228
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,862

229
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,697
-Who?
<i>-Inspector Song Ha-young.</i>

230
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:44,990

233
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:58,003
He's not here at the moment. Okay.

234
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,385
Goodness gracious.

235
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,388
I keep getting calls
from people I don't even know.

236
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,932
I didn't know it'd go viral like this.

237
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,560
I didn't know so many people
would read Yoon-ji's article.

238
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,604
The media has such a wide reach.

239
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,107
Maybe it's all thanks to our team.

240
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,613
He has stepped out of the office.

241
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,574
I'm afraid I can't give you his number.

242
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:28,659
Okay.

243
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,412

Hey, you're early.

256
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,517
What's that?

{\an8}INSPECTOR SONG HA-YOUNG
CRIMINAL PROFILER

258
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,439
Im Moo-sik, this scumbag.

259
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,859
We clearly said no photos.

260
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,571
It's for the better.

261
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,573
I'm glad the media is interested.

262
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,368
We've been talking about
expanding Forensics

263
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,828
into Scientific Investigations Division.

264
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:58,666
I'm guessing the higher-ups
are starting to understand our language.

265
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,668
We were heavily beaten.

266
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:04,630
With that being said,
I want Scientific Investigations

267
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,966
to be led by you, Captain Kook.

268
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,384
-Me?
-Yes.

269
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,220
What are you talking about?
My team keeps me busy enough.

270
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,805
I'm trying to convince them,

271
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:16,058
so don't just say no,
and give it a thought first.

272
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,143
There is nothing to think about.

273
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,604
I don't need that position.
All I need is my team.

274
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,773
On top of that, we only have three people.

275
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,775
It's not an expansion if I'm gone.

276
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,986
-It's a reduction.
-Goodness.

277
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,362
What do you think?

278
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,947
Yes, you can do it instead.

279
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,784
I'll do whatever Captain Kook decides.

280
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,453
But I agree he should lead
Scientific Investigations.

281
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,455
-See? I told you.
-Even he thinks that.

282
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,790
I have enough.

283
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:40,833
-Stop.
-Hey,

284
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,835
-Detective Nam. What is it?
-Forget that.

285
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,461
-Gocheong-dong?
-Deal with Moo-sik.

286
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,671
-That's Guro-gu.
-All right.

287
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,631
-Why alone? What about Yoon?
-He never listens.

288
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,217
She's at the prosecution?
Okay. You should go.

289
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,094
Wait, one second.

290
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,389
Analysis Team should go with him.

291
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,182
-Go where?
-Gocheong-dong.

292
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,560
I'll send them over. Okay.

293
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,686
Why?

294
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,272
It's related to the Southwest Case.

295
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,948
GOCHEONG-DONG, GURO-GU

296
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,203
-Is this it?
-Yes.

297
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,416
The end of April.

298
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:25,002
The weapon was a kitchen knife.

299
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,880
The victim was murdered around 2:30 a.m.
in front of the door,

300
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,840
also with the key in the keyhole.

301
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,595
-Aren't you coming in?
-We start from the outside.

302
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:38,599
We have to check the environment
and the structure of the building.

303
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:42,936
That way, we can infer the reason
why the killer chose this place.

304
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,398
We think like the culprit
and try to guess their movement.

305
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,650
Once we go through this process,

306
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,819
we'll reach the murder scene in the end.

307
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,905
So that you can imagine

308
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,866
where the culprit went and ended up
running into the victim?

309
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:56,909
-That's right.
-I see.

310
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,828
Anyway, how did you receive a report
on Guro-gu's case?

311
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,414
We asked for cooperation,
so police stations nearby

312
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,124
are checking similar cases.

313
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,503
We concluded that the Imyeong-dong case
wasn't Gu Young-chun's doing.

314
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,880
Everyone has eyes on this case
because of the park incident.

315
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,381
-They're cooperative.
-I see.

316
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,633
YONGCHEON VILLA

317
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:15,260
Compared to the cases
from Geumcheon or Dongjak Stations,

318
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,471
-it feels a bit different.
-It is.

319
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,640
How so?

320
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,059
This isn't a residential area.

321
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,435
This villa is secluded.

322
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,979
-Let's go inside.
-Shall we?

323
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,404
The key was in the keyhole.

324
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:38,033
And her bag and wallet were on the floor.

325
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,494
-And the valuables were still in there?
-Yes.

326
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:43,205
Did he wait for the victim
to go into the house?

327
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,915
What if she had family at home?

328
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:48,085
Then his crime would've been exposed.
Would he risk such danger?

329
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:51,255
He's the type who shows his face,

330
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,632
so it's possible,
although I don't understand it.

331
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,634
I think there might be another reason.

332
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,803
Let's go back, then.

333
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,263
First off,

334
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,723
he probably chased her up the stairs.

335
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,726
The victim puts the key in.

336
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,019
She's about to go insideâ€¦

337
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,692
You startled me.

338
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,115
I think he hesitated
until the moment she went in.

339
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,911
The culprit seems aggressive,
but he doesn't seem to be bold.

340
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,581
He's rather timid.

341
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,083
All right.

342
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,293
Just as you said,

343
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,921
he would've hesitated
until the last minute,

344
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,799
then found enough courage
in that last moment.

345
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:40,262
Then what about showing himself

346
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,764
under the bright light and stuff?

347
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,558
He wasn't showing them his face.

348
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,393
It's the other way around.

349
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,478
He wanted to see the victim.

350
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,773
He wanted to check the victim's face
before he kills a stranger?

351
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,483
The moment he attacked them,

352
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,820
he was lookingâ€¦

353
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,198
at the victim's expression.

354
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,553
-Hey.
-You're here.

355
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,554
This is it?

356
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:23,972
-Please print these.
-Okay.

357
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,849
-Did you eat dinner?
-Yes, I did.

358
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:29,770
All right, then. Let's start withâ€¦

359
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,230
Let's hurry.

360
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,737
-Let's seeâ€¦
-Hello.

361
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,863
Oh, hello.

362
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,160
Take a look at this record.

363
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,703
It says right hereâ€¦

364
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,455
In that case, this isâ€¦

365
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,561
<i>I'll have to stay here
until late at night.</i>

366
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,648
<i>Report back to me if anything comes up.</i>

367
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,775
Sinheung 2-dong and Gocheong-dong.

368
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,652
Both victims died in front of the doorâ€¦

369
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,238
with their key in the keyhole.

370
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,031
This shows the culprit hesitated

371
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,700
until the very last moment.

372
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,119
If he's a timid guy,

373
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:30,122
that explains why these victims were
attacked near their house.

374
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,248
Right.

375
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:34,710
The Gocheong-dong case broke out in April,
so it must be before Pureumae Park.

376
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,754
Yes, there were too many cases
reported to Dongjak Station,

377
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:38,922
so they recognized

378
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,799
the Pureumae Park case first.

379
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:43,760
That means the culprit
began to use a kitchen knife

380
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,220
starting in April.

381
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,221
In that case,

382
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,933
the culprit changed the weapon
to make sure he kills the victims,

383
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,102
just as we predicted, right?

384
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,937
That's most probable.

385
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,857
Other than the Imyeong-dong case,
other cases were injuries.

386
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,152
These results probably
made the culprit more anxious.

387
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,862
And he has evolved.

388
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:05,615
He might have studied the ways
just as Gu Young-chun did.

389
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:07,576
He studied?

390
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,828
These people study a lot to kill.

391
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,497
That's why he made
the steel hammer himself.

392
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:21,340
<i>These psychos are beyond my imagination.</i>

393
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,633
Gocheong-dong is in Guro-gu too.

394
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,635
The cases are mostly
in the southwestern area.

395
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,430
Do you really think
he's behind the Imyeong-dong case?

396
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,558
We thought about it for a long time.

397
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,145
But look at the subway line. Line one.

398
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:36,897
Like this.

399
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,984
Most of these areas
are near line number one.

400
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,569
Sometimes line number two.

401
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:45,280
We thought the area was
within the culprit's usual reach.

402
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,826
<i>He might be someone
who lives around line one.</i>

403
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,120
<i>Gu Young-chun traveled</i>

404
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,663
<i>back and forth to confuse us.</i>

405
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,373
<i>He also claimed he took the subway,</i>

406
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,960
<i>but this guy doesn't seem to be
that meticulous.</i>

407
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,924
The cases in the southwestern area are

408
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,383
in different jurisdictions,

409
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,427
but they are all within walking distance.

410
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,428
Precisely.

411
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:13,391
Also, he does not look for his victims
before he acts.

412
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,393
<i>He went out at dawn or late at night,</i>

413
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,854
<i>when there aren't many people
to find a target,</i>

414
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,898
<i>then followed
and attacked them ruthlessly.</i>

415
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:28,156
So we're looking for a psycho
who's lurking around the Southwestern area

416
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,533
with a knife in his hand.

417
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,743
You're right. That's him.

418
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,080
What if he fails to find a victim?

419
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,499
I'm sure there are days he fails.

420
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,376
If such days continueâ€¦

421
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,420
As you can see, he changed his weapon.

422
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:46,049
Then he'll change his MO,
just as Gu Young-chun did.

423
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,896
<i>He changed his weapon
from a camping knife to a kitchen knife.</i>

424
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,522
<i>What will it be next?</i>

425
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:43,732
PROFILING (CRIME ANALYSIS) REPORT

426
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,234
<i>Will it be a steel hammer
like Gu Young-chun?</i>

427
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,486
GOCHEONG-DONG MURDER CASE

428
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,997
<i>His MO evolved by studying his crimes.</i>

429
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,793
<i>He's timid.</i>

430
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:07,172
<i>He hides in an alley
and looks for a victim.</i>

431
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,424
<i>But he's aggressive enough</i>

432
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:11,843
<i>to watch his victim in pain
as he attacks them.</i>

433
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,233
<i>What's next?</i>

434
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:27,984
<i>Where will he be?</i>

435
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:29,778
<i>How far will he go?</i>

436
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,239
Inspector Song?

437
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,619
You're here.

438
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:40,413
I heard you were at the prosecution.

439
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,457
We got done much faster than I expected,

440
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,375
so I stopped by.

441
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,544
I read the case file

442
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:47,963
on the Gocheong-dong case.

443
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:50,507
And this is the profile report.

444
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,469
I'll share this with the SCS tomorrow.

445
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:59,474
"The culprit is introverted
because he lacks the ability

446
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:01,351
to make social connections."

447
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,105
I remember you made a similar analysis

448
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,023
with Cho Hyun-gil a few years ago.

449
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,234
-Is that correct?
-Yes.

450
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,778
Back then, you said that
he chose young kids because

451
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:15,365
they wouldn't be repelled by him,
and then he sexually assaulted them.

452
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,867
That was the reason you gave us
to support your claim.

453
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:19,744
What about this one?

454
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,746
It's similar.

455
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,082
I concluded that
he didn't have the social skills

456
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,875
or the guts to lure his victims.

457
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,337
That sounds plausible.

458
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,173
After all, he followed his victims
at the scene.

459
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,633
Right.

460
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,428
But what worries me is that

461
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,930
his MO is progressing.

462
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:41,141
It's progressing.

463
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:44,060
We need to increase the range
of similar cases we investigate.

464
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,938
Right. But there seem to be

465
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,399
a lot of hypotheticals again.

466
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:53,028
It will be difficult
to make them understand

467
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,529
on what ground you want

468
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:56,281
the investigation to be expanded to.

469
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,825
The more we hesitate and delay it,

470
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,535
the more victims there will be.

471
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:03,705
The Special Crime Squad
wants to catch the culprit

472
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,040
as soon as possible too.

473
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,709
Are you still drawing a line
between our teams

474
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,128
even when innocent people are dying?

475
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:12,881
That's not what I was doing.

476
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:19,137
It's likely that he will move on
to breaking and entering or arson.

477
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,682
-Arson?
-Serial killers.

478
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,017
They enjoy arson.

479
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,644
It's an easy way to satisfy their urges.

480
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,313
And one more thing.

481
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,190
Being timid during the act

482
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,276
is his unique factor.

483
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,743
GOCHEONG-DONG MURDER CASE

484
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:42,952
DATE, TIME, AND LOCATION

485
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:46,998
The murder case took place in April
in a low-rise villa in Gocheong-dong.

486
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:50,752
The victim was attacked
in front of the door

487
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,379
with the key in the keyhole.

488
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,755
This incident resembles

489
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:57,509
the one that took place in the villa
in Sinheung 2-dong in February.

490
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,886
We noticed many factors
which indicated that

491
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:02,055
these incidents were carried out

492
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:04,516
by the culprit of
the Southwest Murder Case.

493
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:09,646
There's so much.

494
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:21,658
<i>Inspector Song is focusing on
the progression of his crimes.</i>

495
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:24,411
He speculated the culprit
might break in and commit arson.

496
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:28,039
Well, I get why the culprit
might start breaking into houses.

497
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,666
But arson too?

498
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:30,917
Right.

499
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,212
Gu Young-chun only set the house on fire
to remove his traces.

500
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:37,298
I'm not so sure if it's right
to put serial killers and arsonists

501
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,466
in the same group.

502
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,761
He said serial killers
are used to committing arson.

503
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:44,431
But still. This is too big of a range.

504
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:45,598
Right.

505
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,226
Then we have to investigate
all the violent crimes.

506
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,532
This is Yoon Tae-gu.

507
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:05,785
Please share any break-in
and arson cases with us.

508
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:09,414
But only the ones where
valuables or money weren't taken.

509
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,583
Hold on.

510
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,213
Please include cases
as long as the amount isn't big.

511
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,303
What are these?

512
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,722
He keeps changing his weapon.

513
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,724
A camping to a kitchen knife.

514
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,434
I'm sure he'll change it again.

515
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,186
Put them away after you study them.

516
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,229
They are just tools.

517
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,023
But they look creepy in this office.

518
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:43,114
What's wrong? What was that?

519
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:45,825
What are you doing?

520
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,911
Becoming him.

521
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:49,788
Becoming him?

522
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,456
I'm trying to become the culprit.

523
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,681
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

524
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,683

00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:20,652
<i>set up an investigation support center
to prepare for the violent crimes</i>

529
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,737
<i>and decided to reform
the Special Crime Squads</i>

530
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,823
<i>into Wide-Area Investigation Squads.</i>

531
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,158
On a day like today,

532
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:30,662
you ought to drink beer
and soju together, Gil-pyo.

533
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,997
Here you go.

534
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:33,998
Enough.

535
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,500
What do you mean? Here.

536
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:39,295
-Okay. Cheers.
-All right.

537
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,090
-Good job.
-Okay.

538
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,514
The tripe here is great.

539
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:54,686
Superintendent Heo Gil-pyo
of Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency.

540
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,521
Too bad that you won't get to see me now.

541
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,106
What are you talking about?

542
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,525
I'm finally going to have
good bowel movements.

543
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,777
When you go to Gyeonggi, shave.

544
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,028
Try to look clean.

545
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,114
It's only a 50 minute drive from here.

546
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,116
You can visit us anytime, right?

547
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,451
No, it takes longer with the traffic jam.

548
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,704
There are a lot more cars
after the World Cup.

549
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,497
The outer ring road is all set up now.

550
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,417
It's hard to visit when you go
somewhere else. You'll know soon.

551
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,086
Please don't forget us when you transfer.

552
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:21,337
Of course, not.

553
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:24,173
-Exactly. Gil-pyo won't forget us.
-Of course.

554
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,718
Good work.

555
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:31,598
By the way, you lost
a lot of weight, Inspector Song.

556
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,016
-Me?
-Yes.

557
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,810
I don't have an appetite these days.

558
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,646
-Goodness.
-Here. Eat a lot.

559
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,816
I know you and Young-soo
are insanely busy.

560
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,194
I don't think you're in any position
to worry about others.

561
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,279
You know what?

562
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:50,366
I'm sure Superintendent Heo
and Captain Kook will do a great job.

563
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,119
He's Chief Kook now.

564
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:55,163
I don't like changes.

565
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,748
Just call me Captain Kook.

566
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,458
How could we, Chief Kook?

567
00:31:58,541 --> 00:31:59,542
Come on.

568
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,753
It sounds like Chief Cook.
I don't like it.

569
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,504
I'll get going first.

570
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,132
-Are you going to the scene?
-Yes.

571
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:09,302
If you have work to do, don't feel bad.
You can go.

572
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:12,180
-Let me go with you.
-No. I'll go alone. Stay here.

573
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,015
-I'm sorry. Please excuse me.
-Sure.

574
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,391
-I'll get going.
-Okay.

575
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:17,352
Bye.

576
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,643
Who are you?

577
00:32:58,726 --> 00:32:59,936
What are you doing here?

578
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:01,312
Right.

579
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,564
I'm sorry. I'm a police officer.

580
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,318
During the resident meeting,
we talked about

581
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,320
a strange man lurking around the building.

582
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,699
Can't you be considerate
of the people who live here?

583
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:13,992
-Sorry.
-Don't stand there.

584
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,493
If you're done, get out!

585
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:17,662
Okay.

586
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:19,789
Sorry, my foot.

587
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,749
So what if you're a cop?

588
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,418
Beat it!

589
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:30,508
YONGCHEON VILLA

590
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,726
-Bye.
-Bye.

591
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,185
-Goodbye.
-See you.

592
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,937
-Sir, there's a taxi.
-Bye.

593
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,188
-Okay. Get me a taxi.
-The taxi.

594
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,524
-Yeonhui-dong!
-Over here. Take the taxi.

595
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:47,525
-Bye.
-Chief Kook.

596
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:49,444
Bye. See you tomorrow.

597
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,743
SONG HA-YOUNG

598
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,467
Who is it?

599
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,636
Ma'am, it's Kook Young-soo.

600
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:17,430
Sir.

601
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,349
Hey.

602
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,310
You're just getting home.

603
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,272
Your mother needs to sleep.

604
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,817
So I'll leave after I nag on you
for a bit.

605
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,698
-Please sit.
-Okay.

606
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,210
It is good to be focused on work,

607
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:50,630
but it is important
to separate work from home.

608
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,340
I know.

609
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,383
But it's not easy.

610
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,344
I live alone, so it's a different story.

611
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,513
But you live with your mother.

612
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,848
If you leave these case files wide openâ€¦

613
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,101
she'll be worried.

614
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:06,187
She has a good understanding of what I do.

615
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:10,525
That's different from how concerned
she must be as a mother.

616
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,570
You need to learn to pay attention

617
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,115
to the people around you too.

618
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:19,784
Thank you for the adviceâ€¦

619
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,453
and also for your nagging.

620
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:26,499
But it comes off as being cheesy
at this time of night.

621
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:28,751
Good point.

622
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,338
I should get going before you kick me out.

623
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,133
-Captain Kook.
-Tidy up a little.

624
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:36,634
I'm off.

625
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,893
I'll try.

626
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,521
Of course, you should.

627
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:50,815
We're in for a long haul.

628
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,317
Right.

629
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:54,902
-Bye.
-Bye.

630
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,154
-Get home safely.
-Okay.

631
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,327
<i>Thirteen murders that took place
in the metropolitan area</i>

632
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:06,747
<i>in the past two years
still remain unsolved.</i>

633
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,750
<i>At this rate, they'll most likely
become cold cases</i>

634
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,752
<i>where the killers remain uncaught.</i>

635
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,338
<i>The murders of the three women
in southwestern Seoul,</i>

636
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:17,925
<i>which began in April,
still remain unsolved.</i>

637
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,719

638
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,721
<i>they'd investigate missing person cases,</i>

639
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,556
<i>but the public trust on them is low.</i>

640
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:26,976
<i>Since there is no evidence
of sexual assault,</i>

641
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:29,187
<i>the police are investigating the incidents</i>

642
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,939
<i>as simple mugging cases
or attacks caused by resentment.</i>

643
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,456
<i>It seems the culprit
usually uses subway line one.</i>

644
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,627
<i>Most of the Southwest Cases</i>

645
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,254
<i>took place late at night

646
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:37,046
<i>If he fails to find a targetâ€¦</i>

647
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:43,010
<i>He takes the risk of attacking
right before his victim opens the door,</i>

648
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,054
<i>because he's obsessed with murder.</i>

649
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,061
-Why are you so late?
-You're still up?

650
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,230
I was so worried. Come on in.

651
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,858

652
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,403

Would you like a bottle of juice?

655
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:15,269
Ma'am.

656
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,188
Anybody around?

657
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:20,107
There's a woman collapsed on the ground.
Anybody around?

658
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,696
Hello, you've reached

659
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,948
the Behavioral Analysis Team.

660
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:29,825
Inspector Song Ha-young?

661
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:31,994
What is it about?

662
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,205
Gunpo Police Station?

663
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:37,541
I see. Fax us the details.
I'll pass it along.

664
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,836
Gunpo? Is it about a new case?

665
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,881
Yes, they think it could be a serial case.

666
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,299
They want us to take a look.

667
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,536
The victims in both cases

668
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,830
were stabbed in the stomach
with the same weapon.

669
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,790
Near Geumyang Station and Gunpo Station,

670
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,041
both on subway line one.

671
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,459
What kind of weapon?

672
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,253
The autopsy says a fruit knife.

673
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:25,131
Those blades are less than 10cm long.

674
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,299
Just like camping knives.

675
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,427
And no money or valuables were stolen?

676
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,137
But this is the most important.

677
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,892
FACIAL COMPOSITE RESULT

678
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,943
Looks a lot like the culprit
in the Southwest Cases.

679
00:40:56,370 --> 00:41:00,332
The cases in Gunpo took place
at around 6 a.m. and 5:40 a.m.

680
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:04,295
There was a huge risk of being seen,
but he took the risk regardless.

681
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,673
A while ago, you mentioned
something about timid aggression.

682
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,049
Is that relevant here?

683
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,761
Yes. He's timid, so he prefers to do it
when people aren't out and around,

684
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,805
but he did this in the morning.

685
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:17,016
It shows us he's willing to take a risk

686
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,142
just to kill.

687
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:22,354
He was probably on his way home
after failing to find a suitable victim

688
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,565
when he ran into the juice lady
near his home.

689
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:28,444
In other words, he was determined to kill.

690
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,071
Yes, at all costs.

691
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,282
Why don't you call Gil-pyo and ask him

692
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:35,743
to share the reports on the cases
occurred in Gyeonggi?

693
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:38,245
Then we'd be able to find
more similar cases.

694
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,289
That's no problem at all,

695
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,666
but there will be a ton of reports.

696
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,085
We'll start with the ones
that took place this year.

697
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:47,046
We'll give it a shot.

00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,821
-Here.
-I was reading that.

704
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:15,574
It's never-ending.

705
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:18,661
-Anyang.
-I'll put the northern district ones here.

706
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:21,163
Do we have the ones
from the southern district too?

708
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,463
Let's have lunch.

709
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,257
-Sounds good.
-Let's go.

710
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,017
Let's go eat something.

711
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,353
You guys go ahead. I'm not hungry.

712
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:46,063
My goodness.

713
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,731
DAILY CASE REPORT

714
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:50,901
-Ha-young.
-Yes?

715
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:53,529
What's that?

716
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,784
Oh, this. It's from Forensics.

717
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,081
Why are you putting it in your drawer?

718
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:07,001
I'll return it later
with the other things.

719
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,211
-Hand it over.
-Sorry?

720
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,921
Hand it over. I'll go return it.

721
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:13,424
-I'll return it later.
-Song Ha-young!

722
00:44:57,486 --> 00:45:00,948
This is not the first time
we got a call regarding this.

723
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,700
My apologies. This won't happen again.

724
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:06,745
-Please be more cautious from now on.
-Of course. I'm sorry.

725
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,872
Thank you for your hard work.
We'll get going.

726
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,999
-Thank you.
-Yes, I'll leave you to it then.

727
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,084
Okay.

728
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:14,336
-Take care.
-Thanks, you too.

729
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:22,344
Let's get something to drink.

730
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:33,272
For the first time, I'm starting to wonder
if I made the right choice.

731
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,191
I was merely tryingâ€¦

732
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,654
to put myself in the culprit's shoes.

733
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:44,283
It's better not to know if you have to
wield a weapon just like them.

734
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:45,909
I was not trying to harm anyone.

735
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,244
But you were a threat.

736
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:51,373
I know it is important
to think in their shoes.

737
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,542
But this method is too dangerous.

738
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:55,836
Look at you.

739
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,255
Just take a look at yourself right now.

740
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,467
Looking into those bastards' minds?
It's all good.

741
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,511
But before thatâ€¦

742
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,973
Take care of yourself first. Please.

743
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:10,017
Whenever I think about them roaming around

744
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,144
and killing innocent peopleâ€¦

745
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:21,028
At night these days,

746
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:24,406
I'm reminded of the victims' faces.

747
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,825
So this is the method you chose?

748
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:31,914
Do you need to murder someone
to catch him?

749
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,464
You seem very unstable right now.

750
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:42,966
I just want to catch them. That's all.

751
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,885
I feel like that responsibility

752
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:47,721
is weighing you down too much.

753
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,766
Ever since your interview
with Gu Young-chun,

754
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,602
you became more impatient.

755
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:57,105
But Ha-young.

756
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:01,401
You have endured everything
so well up until now.

757
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:02,736
It's surprising.

758
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,073
But we're in for a long haul.

759
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:08,909
Take some days off.

760
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,995
-I can manage.
-Ha-young.

761
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,455
I'm sorry for this.

762
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:17,167
This will never happen again. Let's go.

763
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,908
<i>So this is the method you chose?</i>

764
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,662
<i>Do you need to murder someone
to catch him?</i>

765
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:03,714
<i>With crimes happening one after another,</i>

766
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:06,925
<i>anxiety is starting to spread
among the people.</i>

767
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:10,220
<i>The people think
that the police are unreliable.</i>

768
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:16,602
Hello?

769
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:19,771
Can you come pick me up later?

770
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,649
<i>In one town in Seoul,
residents have been taking turns</i>

771
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,110
<i>patrolling the dark
and desolate streets at night.</i>

772
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:27,904
<i>Only the people's troubles
and burdens have increased</i>

773
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:31,199
<i>due to our society's troubling times
and unstable public order.</i>

774
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:35,579
MARCH, 2006

775
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:05,025
MOGU-DONG, GWANAK-GU

776
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,131
<i>A fire broke out at a house in Mogu-dong,
Gwanak-gu at dawn today.</i>

777
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:54,050
<i>The parents who slept
in the master bedroom evacuated.</i>

778
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:57,429
<i>But the daughter who was sleeping
in the other room was found dead.</i>

779
00:50:57,512 --> 00:51:00,015
<i>The police are taking note of
the fact that there are traces</i>

780
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:02,976
<i>of the victim being bludgeoned
in the head multiple times.</i>

781
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:04,561
<i>They're considering the possibility</i>

782
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:07,856
<i>that the culprit started the fire
to cover up the murder.</i>

783
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:11,401
The footsteps from the balcony
headed for the small room first.

{\an8}CRIME SCENE STEPPING PLATES

785
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,405
He wasn't after the valuables.

786
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:19,493
Right, since cash or expensive jewelry
are usually kept in the master bedroom.

787
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:24,539
-You're here.
-Hello.

788
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:28,460
I think it started from here.

789
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:31,880
He stood here and hesitated.

790
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:34,925
What was he hesitating about?

791
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:42,849
If it were meâ€¦

792
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:50,398
Hey, what do you mean, "If it were me"?

793
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:59,658
If I were the culprit, I would have
headed towards the small room first.

794
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:02,828
Timid aggression.

795
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:05,747
It's the unique trait
from the Southwest Case.

796
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:08,208
Do you think it's the same guy?

797
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:09,793
Yes.

CRIME SCENE STEPPING PLATES

799
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:25,058
Usually, there are children

800
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,478
in the smaller rooms.

801
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:32,190
Yes, that's true.

802
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,125
Ha-young.

803
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,302
Just as Inspector Song speculated,

804
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,514
he broke in and it led to arson.

805
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:12,772
Chief Kook.

806
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:15,817
I received a call from Gwanak Station
asking for your team.

807
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:18,194
-They called you first?
-Yes, they did.

808
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:20,238
Those guys are at a loss,

809
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:21,823
so I think they are curious.

810
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:24,868
Go with Inspector Song

811
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:27,829
and brief them
on the profiling analysis you made.

812
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,414
I wonder if they'll even listen.

813
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:30,790
I'm not sure.

814
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:33,376
They may not be welcoming
since it's their first time.

815
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,669
I'm sure you'll do fine.

816
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:37,047
-Okay, we'll do our best.
-All right.

817
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:38,965
{\an8}SEOUL GWANAK POLICE STATION

818
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:41,551
The culprit for Mogu-dong
and Southwest Cases

819
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,053
is the same guy.

820
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:45,680
And he used different weapons
and used them repeatedly.

821
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:48,266
On top of that,
he's used to walking and running.

822
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:51,102
He walked to the scenes,
so he's probably in sneakers.

823
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:53,897
He probably hid his weapon somewhere.

824
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,148
How do you know?

825
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:57,609
It depends on how you attack someone,

826
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,653
but weapons that can kill
are big and sharp,

827
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:01,029
so they're noticeable.

828
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,239
He couldn't have carried it around.

829
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,700
But there is a high chance
that he carries around

830
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:08,119
small weapons like a camping knife.

831
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:11,414
Also, his murder attempts
weren't successful every time,

832
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:13,500
so we must look into
small cases of violence

833
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:14,751
that break out at night.

834
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:17,420
Who does he think he is
to give us a sermon? Right?

835
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:18,463
Right.

836
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:21,675
He was in the newspaper too,
so let's hear him out first.

837
00:54:22,258 --> 00:54:25,762
The culprit is probably around
35 years old.

838
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:27,806
Is he a shaman or what?

839
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:30,600
-Exactly.
-Tell me about it.

840
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,811
Why is he in his mid-thirties?

841
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:37,232
Behavioral Analysis Team

842
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:40,568
turned over 1,000 violent crimes
and cases of violence into data.

843
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:41,736
Hey, wait.

844
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:43,363
Over 1,000 cases?

845
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:46,074
And we've interviewed over 200 criminals.

846
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:47,951
-What?
-Over 200?

847
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:50,578
We used this data to analyze
the random killings,

848
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:55,250
and most of the culprits were
between 33 and 37 years old.

849
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:57,585
So he isn't just a shaman.

850
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:00,880
In order for his anger to blow up,

851
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:04,300
he should at least be in his thirties
to have enough social provocation.

852
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:07,595
Don't people in their twenties
blow up in anger more often?

853
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,180
-Young people are scarier.
-Right.

854
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,432
You're right.

855
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:14,227
People in their twenties tend to be
more impulsive.

856
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:17,897
However, no, perhaps that's why
their crimes are mostly random,

857
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:21,192
without a plan or bringing changes
into their MO.

858
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:27,240
The culprit lacks social skills.

859
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:28,491
So if you talk to him,

860
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:32,787
there is a high possibility
that he'll avoid your eyes.

861
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:36,082
-Get it out there.
-Yes, hurry.

862
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,792
-Do we look into those cases?
-Yes.

863
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:40,045
All cases.
Culprits must be in their thirties.

864
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,296
Excuse me.

865
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,257
-Excuse me, sir.
-What is it?

866
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,967
We're from Gwanak Police Station.

867
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:48,845
I'm sorry to ask,
but could you take your glasses off?

868
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:55,101
We're from Gwanak Police Station.
Are you Kim In-kyu, 38 years old?

869
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,061
That's me.

870
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:59,814
By any chance, have you seen
a man who looks like this around here?

871
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:02,150
Have you seen a man who looks like this?

872
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:03,985
I haven't.

873
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:16,873
SINHEUNG 6-DONG, YEONGDEUNGPO-GU

874
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:14,157
What? Who are you?

875
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,330
What?

876
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:26,085
Hey, let go of me!

877
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:28,129
You bastard!

878
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:58,618
Over here.

879
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,954
We're from Sinheung Precinct.
Who called it in?

880
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:02,372
It was me.

881
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:04,958
This bastard. He's a robber.

882
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,376
My son almost died.

883
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:28,606
What kind of an robber carries
such a heavy weapon?

884
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,608
-So stupid.
-Tell me about it.

885
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:33,611
Isn't that too heavy for you?

886
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:36,364
You should go out and get a job.

887
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:38,658
People get paid a lot
for day labor these days.

888
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:39,951
Exactly.

889
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:53,590
SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION
BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS TEAM

890
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:54,799
Inspector Song.

891
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:58,219
What is this?

892
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:00,054
NAM KI-TAE

893
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:01,389
It's from Yeongdeungpo Police Station.

894
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:03,558
SPOTTED RELEVANCE WITH SOUTHWEST CASE

895
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:12,400
YEONGDEUNGPO POLICE STATION

896
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:14,402
-What's wrong with you?
-We caught the man!

897
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:16,279
-That's nonsense!
-What are you saying?

898
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:17,280
Hello, one second.

899
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:18,364
One second.

900
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:19,699
All right, now.

901
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:20,742
Everyone, look here.

902
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:21,993
Superintendent Baek.

903
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:24,954
I'm Superintendent Baek Jun-sik
of Seoul Agency.

904
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,706
-Yes.
-Hello.

905
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:30,668
I understand that you are all dying
to interrogate this guy.

906
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:34,005
But first, this profiler,
Inspector Song Ha-young,

907
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:37,592
will have a talk with the suspect.

908
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:40,678
After that, we'll hear out
what Inspector Song has to say.

909
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:42,305
And then we'll interrogate him.

910
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:44,766
-But he's not the one who--
-I get it. I know.

911
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:48,561
We know that Yeongdeungpo got him first.
We'll give you enough time in order.

912
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:02,033
What?

913
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:04,911
Do you know me?

914
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,295
HOW THE PROFILER CAUGHT GU YOUNG-CHUN

915
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:16,005
IT'S THAT CAREER YOU SAW
IN <i>THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS</i>

916
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:18,716
Gu Young-chun.

917
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:22,845
You're the guy who caught him.

918
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:32,188
<i>He's the one we've been looking for.</i>

919
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:38,778
STAY TUNED FOR THE EPILOGUE

920
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:46,536
PROFILING (CRIME ANALYSIS) REPORT

921
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,925
HOW THE PROFILER CAUGHT GU YOUNG-CHUN

922
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,722
GU YOUNG-CHUN PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS

923
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:08,474
CHILDHOOD, CRIME PREPARATION

924
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,184
I have a question.

925
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:15,064
The results on his childhood
and his emotional and cognitive thinking

926
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:17,984
are all shared by criminals

927
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:20,486
as we can see in our interview reports.

928
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:23,489
Then if we put
these characteristics together,

929
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:26,242
can we predict someone
who will be a monster in the future?

930
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:29,245
That's the most troubling area.

931
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:32,582
For example, arson and animal abuse

932
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:35,710
that are spotted after a certain age
are considered as signs

933
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:37,628
of a potential serial killer.

934
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:40,339
Gu Young-chun's childhood
does match with the theory,

935
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:43,050
but I'm not sure
if we should include this.

936
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:44,010
You're right.

937
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:46,721
People who had a bad childhood

938
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:49,182
don't all become criminals.

939
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:51,100
Some people end up becoming stronger.

940
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:54,270
I went through a lot
because we were dirt-poor.

941
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,439
But I grew up into a detective.

942
01:02:56,522 --> 01:02:58,357
And I grew up with a single mother.

943
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:04,405
Do you think monsters are born or made?

944
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:06,073
I'm not sure.

945
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:09,118
If such lives are decided
from the moment they're born,

946
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:11,913
it just seems too unfair and cruel.

947
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:15,249
Life is always unfair.

948
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:19,545
At times, when I'm sitting with criminals,

949
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:22,965
I want to believe
that people are born evil.

950
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:27,970
"He must have always been that evil.
There's no way he was once good."

951
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:31,682
And if such people are made,

952
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:34,268
our world is hopeless.

953
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:40,650
The world that created the monster

954
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:43,110
must take responsibility too.

955
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:44,904
Right.

956
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:47,240
I wonder what childhood they hadâ€¦

957
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:49,575
to become such monsters.

958
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:53,079
I want to believe
that people are born evil,

959
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:56,123
but a bigger part of me wants to believe
people are born good.

960
01:03:57,542 --> 01:04:00,419
"One's perception of others determines

961
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:02,630
whether people
are inherently good or evil."

962
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:04,257
That's what I heard.

963
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:08,386
Then it means
I haven't given up hope on people, right?

964
01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:11,806
What about you?

965
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,352
I don't think it matters how we're born.

966
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:20,481
It's important to remember

967
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:24,026
that decisions are made by us,
not by other people.

968
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:27,446
Right. Whether or not
our world has monsters,

969
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:32,910
it's important to remember
that anyone can become one.

970
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:38,749
It's been four years
since our team was formed.

971
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:43,296
A part of me is concerned.

972
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,466
Don't go in too deep.

973
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:50,678
If you do,

974
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:53,472
you might fall into that hole.

975
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:02,857
I'm not here to interrogate you.

976
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,567
<i>I here to speak with you.</i>

977
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:05,943
There was no luminol reaction.

978
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:07,737
<i>We need to find the victim's DNA.</i>

979
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:09,989
<i>We won't be forced to release him, right?</i>

980
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:11,949
<i>This punk is no joke.</i>

981
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:13,659
Nam Ki-tae also gave his all
to his murders.

982
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:15,077
Do you want to hear my story?

983
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:17,997
I couldn't share this with anyone,
so I was really frustrated.

984
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,749
<i>"He who fights with monsters</i>

985
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:22,376
should look to it that he himself
does not become a monster."

986
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:24,253
<i>There's no need for you
to bear it all yourself.</i>

987
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:26,464
<i>I wouldn't have even started
if I was going to avoid it.</i>
