1
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,498
More heinous criminals will show up.

2
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,000
This team is always working very hard.

3
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,210
But there still has to be someone
preparing for what may happen.

4
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,004
<i>We need you to take on a case.</i>

5
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,798
<i>He and his wife were murdered
in their home two weeks ago.</i>

6
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,760
<i>There was cash lying around,
but he didn't even touch it.</i>

7
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:54,679
<i>They think it's an act of resentment
masked as a burglary.</i>

8
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,057
<i>What? It's clean.</i>

9
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:01,519
<i>The victims were overpowered
without any sort of resistance.</i>

10
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,106
GUNGOK-DONG FAMILY MURDER CASE

11
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,735
<i>A type of systematic crime committed
according to a plan.</i>

12
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,654
<i>Is this a way of expressing</i>

13
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,573
<i>the culprit's emotions
caused by a grudge they hold?</i>

14
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:14,616
<i>Hiking shoes.</i>

15
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:17,410
This one is from Suseong-dong, Gangnam.

16
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,412
And this one is from Gungok-dong, Jongno.

17
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,664
They're from different areas
but the same culprit?

18
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,166
JINJUNG-DONG, GANGNAM-GU

19
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,293
<i>There was another case in Jinjung-dong.</i>

20
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,921
<i>You're not an investigator. Why?</i>

21
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,839
Please. I must check the crime scene.

22
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,216
Hey. Didn't you hear me?

23
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,218
I told you to get lost, you bastard!

24
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,511
Damn it.

25
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,429
This is important.

26
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,975
<i>The victim was hit by a blunt weapon.</i>

27
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,436
<i>And the safe wasn't touched either.</i>

28
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:47,232
<i>The culprit went to different areas
and his only purpose was to kill.</i>

29
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,234
<i>This is the third murder.</i>

30
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:51,820
<i>It's a serial murder.</i>

31
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,196
HWANGHWA-DONG, JONGNO-GU

32
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,657
<i>Hurry to the scene in Hwanghwa-dong.</i>

33
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,658
<i>A senior citizen was murdered.</i>

34
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,326
Why did he suddenly start a fire?

35
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,828
He's never done that before.

36
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,622
<i>I'm sure he came across
an unexpected situation.</i>

37
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,833
<i>He either wanted
to destroy unwanted traces</i>

38
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,251
<i>or it could've been his trace.</i>

39
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,335
It's CCTV footage.

40
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,878
<i>We got a shot of the back of the culprit.</i>

41
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,505
Let's put out an APB.

42
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:13,925
You want us to do that with
just the footage that shows his back?

43
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,969
Are you suggesting that
we give him a warning

44
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,138
-that he could get caught?
-That's correct.

45
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:22,142
The only way to prevent him
from committing the next murder is this.

46
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:25,436
<i>The footage shows a man
in a black jacket walking.</i>

47
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,230
<i>The police have identified
this man in the footage…</i>

48
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,439
Even after you put out the APB…

49
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,151
-At least share the information!
-Tell us anything.

50
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,735
<i>It's been over three months</i>

51
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,321
<i>and the police still don't have
a single lead on the culprit.</i>

52
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,573
<i>The decision for an open search.</i>

53
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,826
<i>Is this the police's lifeline
or is this the beginning of doom?</i>

54
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,619
<i>Did he give up on committing
another crime to hide?</i>

55
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,914
<i>Or is he still planning another crime?</i>

56
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,249
You never miss a day.

57
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,210
We never know
when the crimes will start again.

58
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:52,213
We will catch him. Certainly.

59
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,756
What if the culprit changed the MO?

60
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,924
<i>What do we do then?</i>

61
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,343
-What are the police doing?
-Exactly.

62
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,053
They still haven't been able
to catch a punk like this.

63
00:02:59,137 --> 00:02:59,971
-I know, right?
-Yes.

64
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,144

DAILY CASE REPORT

68
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,827
VICTIM PARK SO-EUN

69
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,124
THE VICTIM WAS ATTACKED
ON FEBRUARY 12, 2004,

70
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:34,792
IN THE CHEST, STOMACH, AND SIDE
ON HER WAY HOME

71
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,989
It's so cold. Hey, it's warm inside.

72
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,908
-You're early.
-You're here.

73
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,242
You got here so early.

74
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,702
-Yes, I did.
-It's freezing.

75
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,455
-It's really cold out, isn't it?
-Yes.

76
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,581
Inspector Song.

77
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:17,376
Last week, I made a wish while looking
at the first full moon of the year.

78
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,836
What?

79
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,172
It's been four years
since I joined the team.

80
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,841
I really hope you can start

81
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,761
talking to me casually this year.

82
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:29,430
Hey, come on. It's been four years.

83
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,808
Woo-ju says it's his wish.

84
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,477
Woo-ju, our universe!
Can't you grant his wish?

85
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,312
Was that a joke?

86
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,898
I'll start talking casually then.

87
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,066
Really?

88
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:43,361
Had I known it'd be this easy,
I would've brought it up long ago.

89
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,404
I should've done this long ago.

90
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,405
It took too long.

91
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,283
Are you playing favorites?

92
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,409
You don't laugh at my jokes.

93
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,994
But you laughed at his lame joke.

94
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,997
He laughed because he likes me,
not because I'm funny.

95
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:56,958
That's right.

96
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,585
You must be a snowflake
because he fell for you.

97
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,967
You're so mean.

98
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,220
Anything showing a similar pattern?

99
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,472
-No, not the same pattern.
-Let's see.

100
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:12,890
DAILY CASE REPORT

101
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,851
An assault case…

102
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,562
Nothing.

103
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,272
I hope he has stopped.

104
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,109
Whatever he may be doing,

105
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,528
we just need to do our job.

106
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,238
We got this.

107
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,490
We got this.

108

PROFILING (CRIME ANALYSIS) REPORT

109
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,789
Why are you going through
the profiling report?

110
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,332
Hoping to find some clues.

111
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,168
Clues, my foot.

112
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,128
Thanks to that idiot, Song Ha-young,

113
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,464
the police were criticized
for being incompetent.

114
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,841
And now, the culprit has gone into hiding.

115
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,594
Where are you going?

116
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,596
Why do you care?

117
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,141
Oh, it's a record.

118
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,226
He got here less than 30 minutes ago.

119
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,895
HWANGHWA-DONG MURDER

120
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:04,066
Time is ticking, but we have no idea
where this scum is.

121
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,112
-Oh, you're early.
-Hello.

122
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,030
How have you been?

123
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,990
Woo-ju, say hello before you step out.

124
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,366
Nice to meet you.

125
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,786
This case made me feel the need to study,
so I'll be joining you today.

126
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,205
Good thinking.

127
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,248
-I'll be right back.
-Okay, hurry.

128
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,375
We'll get started when Woo-ju gets back.

129
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,919
-Take a seat.
-You can sit here.

130
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,462
Professors.

131
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,756
There are so many scumbags in this world

132
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,716
that we've got lots of studying to do.

133
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,718
About the serial murder of rich seniors.

134
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,970
The weapon
hasn't been identified yet, right?

135
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,263
No, not yet.

136
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,725
What causes that triangle-shaped scar?

137
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:38,976
We've been checking

138
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,897
every blunt weapon we can think of,
but haven't found a match so far.

139
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,732
The abrasion, hypodermal bleeding,

140
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:45,942
and laceration.

141
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,945
Also considering the depth of the dent,
it's not a light weapon.

142
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:52,240
Considering the weight and force,
a steel hammer would be a match,

143
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:55,743
but they're usually either round or sharp.

144
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,829
And It's not easy
to carry it around as it's long.

145
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:02,500
Captain Kook, I'm beginning to think
that your guess may be correct.

146
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,543
It makes me anxious.

147
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,169
That the culprit made the weapon?

148
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,921
If that's true, we can't identify it.

149
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,175
I've never seen anyone
put so much effort into murder.

150
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:16,013
-I bought it.
-It's so cold.

151
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,225
Anyway, is the lady in that building okay?

152
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,686
-I think so.
-My goodness.

153
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:22,812
What if she'd died--

154
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,564
-That building.
-Goodness.

155
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,107
What happened?

156
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:30,611
Last night, a lady
on the second floor nearly died.

157
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,613
Thank goodness she didn't die.

158
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,658
A stranger followed her and stabbed her.

159
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,495
She didn't die?

160
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,956
She's still alive?

161
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:45,710
Richard Chase was also abused
by his parents as a kid.

162
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:48,212
He wet his bed, committed arson,
and abused animals,

163
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,256
which are common in serial killers.

164
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,676
He killed adults and children
in a brutal manner.

165
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,595
He didn't hold a grudge against them.

166
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,973
Why did he brutally murder victims
chosen at random?

167
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:02,560
Most murderers like him usually kill
for their own pleasure and enjoyment.

168
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,895
For pleasure, not because of anger?

169
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,315
That is the most frightening part.

170
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:10,318
It means killing makes them happy.

171
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,361
Killing satisfies them,

172
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,238
so they can't stop.

173
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,699
They become bolder,
looking for bigger pleasures.

174
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:17,617
Correct.

175
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,244
That's why he mutilated the body
and practiced cannibalism.

176
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,789
Sexually deviant killers
tend to commit such acts.

177
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,709
So Richard Chase's cases
are often categorized as lust murders

178
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,336
and as sexual homicides.

179
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,672
Sexual homicides?

180
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,007
That's right.

181
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,843
The way he mutilated his victims
doesn't show a pattern.

182
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,511
There's no pattern at all.

183
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,014
He didn't know much about human anatomy,

184
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,557
nor did he try to study.

185
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,476
Right, and he didn't even bother

186
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,311
tidying up the scene.

187
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,813
He didn't even try to conceal evidence.

188
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,398
So we could say that

189
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,275
Chase's murders were unsystematic.

190
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,861
He chose his victims at random,
and it wasn't premeditated.

191
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:57,239
And even when he was caught at the scene,
he was very confused.

192
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,617
On top of that,
he suffered from schizophrenia.

193
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,203
His cases were
typical unsystematic murders.

194
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:06,874
<i>We need a list
of your psychiatric patients since 1999.</i>

195
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,428
How do you manage to stay stuck
in the press room?

196
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,890
You're doing field coverage
and writing all the articles.

197
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:25,434
I get your passion,
but your juniors will hate you.

198
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:29,271
Aren't we both used to people hating us?

199
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,564
Don't worry.

200
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,066
Not me.

201
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,985
What are you talking about?
Your juniors hate you way more.

202
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,447
So?

203
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,408
Will you do it for me or not?

204
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,535
We have to catch the serial killer.

205
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,036
You know we're busy.

206
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,913
Come on. Don't be like this.

207
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:53,295
Of course,
Mr. Kwak knows how busy you are.

208
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,758
He files a report whenever
one of his girls goes missing,

209
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,219
but the police don't seem to care,

210
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,138
so he's getting all anxious.

211
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,056
Good grief.

212
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,560
Hey, over here!

213
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,064
He's here.

214
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,692
This is the detective. Say hello.

215
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:19,697
Reporter Im has told me a lot about you.

216
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,865
Hello, Chief Kim.

217
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,075
I'm Kwak Man-hyun.

218
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,326
GIRLS IN THEIR TWENTIES

219
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,538
You didn't have to do this.

220
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:30,708
Come on. You two should meet.

221
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,002
-No pressure.
-None.

222
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:36,046
Anyway, pretend not to know me
when you see me at the station.

223
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,966
I always do.
Are you worried I'll suddenly say hi?

224
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,552
Who knows?

225
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:44,263
The one thing I learned
while working as a detective

226
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:47,099
is that you should never trust anyone.

227
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,607
-What brings you by?
-Hello, sir.

228
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,985
I haven't been here
since the team was bad,

229
00:12:58,569 --> 00:12:59,778
and it still looks crummy.

230
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,990
Hey, do you have water?

231
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,242
-Water?
-Forget it.

232
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,666
I can't tell if this is a killer's hideout

233
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,126
or a hideout to catch killers.

234
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,628
Are you here to pick a fight?

235
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,671
Hey, those red marks.

236
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,215
What are they about?

237
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,635
Today is the 154th day
after the first case broke out.

238
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,845
The 105th day
since we put out the APB on him.

239
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,767
You guys even remember
your families' birthdays?

240
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,769
Leave if you're going to stop us.

241
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,729
Kicking me out already?

242
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:36,815
Why else would the chief
of the Special Crime Squad be here?

243
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,443
Goodness. Are you a psychic or what?

244
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:45,032
A scary wolf is roaming around
inside the rabbit burrow.

245
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,576
We won't stop until we catch the wolf.

246
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,619
End of discussion.

247
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,913
Fine. I heard you.

248
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:54,542
Just be careful and stay out of Bong-sik
and Captain Yoon's sight.

249
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,711
You're the chief of the team,
yet you always walk on eggshells.

250
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,714
What? Do you not walk on eggshells
around your juniors?

251
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,637
Captain Yoon is one thing,

252
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,765
but Bong-sik has such a nasty temper.

253
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:12,142
I do too.

254
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,104
What do you say?
Should I go ahead and load my gun?

255
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,398
That lunatic will actually
pull the trigger.

256
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,899
That's the problem.

257
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:23,070
He's been on everyone's case
with that temper of his.

258
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,949
Still, we can't just sit back
and do nothing.

259
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,909
We don't know when the murder will start.

260
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,995
It's not like I don't know that! Damn it.

261
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,122
My head hurts.

262
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,666
I'm leaving.
This place is giving me a headache again.

263
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,669
Would you like some tea…

264
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,421
Thanks for asking me so damn early.

265
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,631
Why are you getting mad at that nice kid?

266
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,634
Goodness, taking your teammate's side?

267
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,930
Be good. I'm watching you.

268
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,640
Goodbye.

269
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,684
So why were you really here?

270
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:57,021
I came because I missed you. Happy?

271
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,731
Goodbye.

272
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,817
I'm sure you were here to nag me!

273
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,821
A hundred and five days?

274
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:10,618
Those stubborn wackos.

275
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,545
Hello.

276
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,881
Yoon Tae-gu of
Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

277
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,216
-I heard you have information.
-Yes, I called.

278
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,763
Hey!

279
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,018
What are you doing?

280
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,227
What's with you?

281
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,688
We're detectives.

282
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,065
Is that so?

283
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,232
-I'm sorry.
-Okay, fine.

284
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,568
Darn it.

285
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,042
<i>The train is approaching.</i>

286
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,545
<i>Please step behind the safety line.</i>

287
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,673
<i>Do you think
we live with pointless anxiety?</i>

288
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,008
<i>It comes with the job.</i>

289
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,657
HAN JONG-YONG, YOON JUNG-YOON

290
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,463
-Gosh, it's pouring.
-It's cold.

291
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,841
-Hello.
-Hello.

292
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,467
-Are you two coming in?
-Yes.

293
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,219
-Are you going out?
-To the market.

294
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,096
Look what you've got there.

295
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,858
This is really good.

296
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:08,902
-Anyway.
-Yes?

297
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,448
"Is this the police's lifeline
or is this the beginning of doom?"

298
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,449
That one was harsh.

299
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,200
It's true. What about it?

300
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,785
Inspector Song doesn't show it,

301
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,705
but he's already in a tight spot
after he put out the APB.

302
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,791
So who on earth is this Inspector Song?

303
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,877
One of the two people I respect the most.

304
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,170
Behavioral Analysis Team?

305
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,087
The profiler?

306
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,088
Yes.

307
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:32,634
After what Inspector Song
said to me on my first day,

308
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,387
I never regretted joining this team.

309
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,638
What did he say?

310
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,516
He asked me that day
why I applied for this team.

311
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,228
Nothing really came to my mind,
so I immaturely replied,

312
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,189
"Because it seemed cool."

313
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,523
And he said,

314
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,026
Do you know the story
of the blind man and a lantern?

315
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,321
Someone asked a blind man
who was walking down a dark road

316
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,655
with a lantern in his hand.

317
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,992
"You can't see anyway.
Why do you carry that around?"

318
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,369
Why do you think so?

319
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:05,417
He wanted others to see clearly

320
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,127
and not fall down while walking.

321
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,671
<i>I see. That's touching.</i>

322
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,298
<i>A lantern.</i>

323
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,634
VICTIMS: HAN SEOK-HOON, YANG KYUNG-HEE

324
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,677
KWON HYUN-SOOK, 54, FEMALE

325
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,471
<i>Then tell me his name too.</i>

326
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:20,682
<i>-Inspector Song Ha-young.
-Song Ha-young?</i>

327
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,918
-Honey.
-Hey.

328
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,546
-Did you wait for long?
-I just got off.

329
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:55,092
-It's raining a lot.
-Yes.

330
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,969
Can you put it in here?

331
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:59,012
-Yes. Thank you.
-Sure.

332
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,639
-Enjoy.
-Goodbye.

333
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,433
My gosh, why is it raining so much?

334
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,862
I'm home.

335
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,537
Mom?

336
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,520
<i>The receiver cannot be reached.</i>

337
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,591
I'm sorry. I'm late.

338
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,343
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

339
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,971
I left it at the bakery.

340
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,139
When I went back,
they were already closed.

341
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,309
You didn't have to get this.

342
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,979
And from now on, tell me to get these.

343
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,230
No.

344
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:16,233
I'm much better than you
at picking out ingredients.

345
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,360
Goodness,
I'm glad I made the soup earlier.

346
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,953
Honey, you should also celebrate
Ha-young's birthday with us.

347
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:45,238
<i>The sky is blue,
and cherry blossoms are in full blossom.</i>

348
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,075
<i>The weather continues to stay nice
and makes us feel warm.</i>

349
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,077
<i>The temperature will rise tomorrow,</i>

350
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,371
<i>and it'll be a bit hotter in the south
like early summer.</i>

351
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,916
<i>But the air is a bit drier.</i>

352
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,417
<i>In Chungcheong and Gangwon…</i>

353
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,545
-What's that?
-The daily case report.

354
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:04,174
I said we won't return to the office
after visiting the prison,

355
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,592
and Woo-ju gave these to me.

356
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,053
Where did we find
a such treasure like that kid?

357
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,639
I still have good luck with people.

358
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,724
Am I included in that luck?

359
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,309
Why? Do you think you aren't?

360
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:15,894
You're worried over nothing.

361
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,940
-Nothing, right?
-No.

362
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,776
I'm not sure if that's good,
or if finding something is good.

363
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:25,403
I wouldn't feel so frustrated
only if we could figure out

364
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,114
if he stopped or changed his MO.

365
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,199
"Mugging in a residential area,

366
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:32,786
stabbed in the left side,
serious injury inflicted by the stab…"

367
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:34,788
"Camping knife"?

368
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,082
-Camping knife?
-Yes.

369
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,129
Why?

370
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,005
May I see that again?

371
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,882
-Which one? Sinheung 4-dong?
-Yes.

372
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,592
It's just an assault case.

373
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,970
-May I see it?
-Which one?

374
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,182
"April 15, 3:30 a.m.
A residential area, in public.

375
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,433
Victim, female.

376
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,852
Serious injury inflicted

377
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,603
by a stab on the left side."

378
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,940
-"Weapon was a camping knife."
-Camping knife.

379
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:05,360
Camping knife.

380
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,196
ATTACKED WITH A CAMPING KNIFE

381
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,616
Could you please make a call to Woo-ju?

382
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,410
Sure. One second.

383
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:18,290
Hey, Woo-ju.

384
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:21,710
Can you look up "camping knife"
and find some reports?

385
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,879
-Camping knife?
<i>-Yes, this year.</i>

386
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,839
I remember reading it.

387
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,132
One second.

388
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:30,051
You should begin with
Dongjak Police Station.

389
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,011
2004 DAILY CASE REPORT

390
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:35,557
CAMPING KNIFE

391
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,810
-Two cases popped up.
-Two cases?

392
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,188
Yes. In Sinheung 5-dong
and Sinheung 2-dong.

393
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,106
Both cases are from February this year.

394
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,441
Tell me about the victims.

395
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,610
Both of them were women in their twenties.

396
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,236
And they have serious injuries.

397
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,030
Both were categorized as assaults.

398
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,910
Print the case reports.

399
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,456
Let's go.

400
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,336
Captain Yoon.

401
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:05,921
Did you look into it?

402
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:12,427
The cases in Guo-dong and Borim-dong
took place in January and February.

403
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,637
Captain Yoon.

404
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,513
Do you think it's the same guy?

405
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,265
Both victims had serious injuries.

406
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,017
They were reported as assault cases.

407
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,228
Neither of the victims
can remember his face?

408
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:23,813
They remember seeing
him running away from the back.

409
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:27,359
Both victims said that he was short
and had a small build.

410
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,985
But it might be a bit of a leap

411
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,321
to say that they were attacked
by the same guy.

412
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:36,243
But the wealthy senior citizen murders
happened in different districts.

413
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:38,370
But even if we assume that his MO changed,

414
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,872
it's still confusing
because the victims didn't die.

415
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,292
Both victims were

416
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:48,255
stabbed in the abdomen by a camping knife.

417
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:51,299
The same weapon
and location of the stab wounds.

418
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:55,637
Based on this, we can assume
that the culprit is the same person.

419
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,097
But I'm not sure

420
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,683
if it's enough to report this
as criminal intelligence.

421
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,394
This part bothers me the most.

422
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:07,107
{\an8}A suspect who is 170cm with a small build.

423
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,819
It's similar to the guy we're looking for.

424
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,322
This is from Geumcheon Police Station?

425
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,741
Yes. The detective in charge is my friend.

426
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,285
And we recently had a drink.

427
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:21,413
When he told me about this, it felt fishy.
So we looked into it.

428
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:22,956
What about this?

429
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,501
At our last meeting,
Inspector Song mentioned the possibility

430
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:28,378
that he might change his MO.

431
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:31,506
I remembered what he said that day.

432
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:34,467
So we kept an eye out to see
if there were any cases

433
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:35,844
following a pattern.

434
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,554
So these cases

435
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:42,350
could have been executed by him?

436
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,268
That's what you mean?

437
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:46,479
Whether it's true or not,
it still bothers me.

438
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,775
But this isn't a homicide.

439
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,902
It's not enough to take over the cases.

440
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,487
They are just two assault cases.

441
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:57,324
Let us investigate this ourselves.

442
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,617
Goodness. It's all because of this jerk.

443
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,870
I'm starting to see everything
as serial murder.

444
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,371
All cases bring him to my mind.

445
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,664
Same here.

446
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:08,043
But these cases
don't seem to suit his style.

447
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,046
Whether it's him or not,
if we are suspicious,

448
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,547
we must investigate.

449
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,300
Even if we waste time,
that's better than losing him

450
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,426
because we didn't try.

451
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,845
Woo-ju, you got the reports?

452
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,181
Are they important cases?

453
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:23,141
-We're not sure yet.
-Is it him?

454
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:26,061
There's a small possibility
if he changed his MO.

455
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,437
We'll be back. Let's go.

456
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,355
We'll be back.

457
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,324
The victim is in the hospital now.

458
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,076
She needs to rest.

459
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,285
So you can't meet her.

460
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,996
-This is her statement.
-Okay.

461
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,123
He kept following her,

462
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,708
so she threw him her purse.

463
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:49,959
But he wasn't interested.

464
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:53,046
How did you confirm
it was a camping knife?

465
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:56,299
Given the size of the stab wound,
we knew it wasn't a kitchen knife.

466
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:59,552
The victim also said
that the knife was small.

467
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,304
The size was about half of our palm.

468
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,306
I showed her a few photos.

469
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,891
And she chose camping knives.

470
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:07,519
-Was there an eyewitness?
-Yes.

471
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,981
He heard screams,
so he opened the window and yelled.

472
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,400
Then the culprit ran away.

473
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:19,489
He was short, skinny, balding,
and wearing a shabby tracksuit.

474
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,282
Can we meet with him?

475
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,659
Sure.

476
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,661
And what about the other two cases?

477
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,121
The other two cases?

478
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,873
Two cases with a similar MO
took place in February.

479
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:29,999
Take a look here.

480
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,002
-Sinheung 5-dong.
-Okay.

481
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,379
Sinheung 2-dong.

482
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:38,091
You need to ask the team in charge.
I don't know about this.

483
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:40,802
He's in charge. Detective Kim, come here.

484
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,722
<i>He followed her in front of her home.</i>

485
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,933
<i>He stabbed her
when she had her key in the hole.</i>

486
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:48,560
<i>He sounded like a total nutcase.</i>

487
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,645
<i>Did he try to steal her wallet?</i>

488
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,106
After stabbing her,
he left without touching her bag.

489
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:56,818
So the victim was about to go in.

490
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,403
And the bastard jumped on her.

491
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,113
<i>Then he turned her around.</i>

492
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,489
<i>And he started stabbing.</i>

493
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,576
She couldn't remember his face
as she was shocked.

494
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,538
She said he was short. Right.

495
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:09,956
He was about 170cm tall.

496
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,709
Not having security cameras
in a blind spot like this

497
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,252
is always a problem.

498
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:15,879
But we have more than last year.

499
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,213
This is an improvement.

500
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,216
Right. That's good.

501
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,720
-But we still need more.
-Right.

502
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:25,722
-Is that the house?
-Yes. The second floor.

503
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,683
That's where I screamed.

504
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,060
Where was the culprit?

505
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,021
Over there. Under the streetlamp.

506
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,106
Something seemed off,
so I was watching them.

507
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,275
All of a sudden,
the woman started screaming.

508
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,531
So I screamed, "Hey! What are you doing?"

509
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,866
<i>When I screamed,</i>

510
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,578
<i>he ran away. And he was really fast.</i>

511
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,122
You also said that he was short.

512
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,332
He was short.

513
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,334
He was losing hair. He had a bald spot.

514
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:57,253
Didn't he wear hiking shoes?

515
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,173
I'm not sure about that.

516
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,674
Right. You were pretty far.

517
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,927
What do you mean by he was fast?

518
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:07,263
The light was bright,
so I could see him running away.

519
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,474
Enough for you to see
he was a fast runner?

520
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,476
Yes. I was surprised by how fast he was.

521
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:18,191
The victim suspected
it could've been an act of retaliation.

522
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:20,443
So we assumed
it could've been an acquaintance.

523
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,986
We started questioning her friends.

524
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:25,448
You didn't find any fingerprints
or evidence for either case?

525
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:28,910
Right. He followed her to her house
like he was determined to attack her.

526
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,829
She wasn't sure if he was following her.

527
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,747
But he came into the building too.

528
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,250
And he took something out of his jacket

529
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,626
and stabbed her right away.

530
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,920
This case took place in Guo-dong.

531
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,089
But it's the same MO with Borim-dong.

532
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,132
The location changed,
but still no evidence.

533
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,593
On top of that, it rained that day.

534
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:49,180
A camping knife,
a stab wound to the abdomen,

535
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,850
and no valuables or money were taken.

536
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,310
<i>She didn't know she was being followed
because of the rain.</i>

537
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,271
<i>The victim was on the ground.</i>

538
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,565
<i>When he saw a car coming,</i>

539
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,066
<i>he was surprised and ran away.</i>

540
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,235
The descriptions are similar.

541
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,362
-But no luck yet?
-He was short.

542
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,823
And when she was on the ground,
she saw his feet.

543
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,908
He was wearing sneakers.

544
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,660
Not hiking shoes?

545
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,078
She said he wore sneakers.

546
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,374
Sneakers.

547
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:24,382
The fact that he didn't take money
or valuables bothers me the most.

548
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:25,383
Right?

549
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:29,512
He committed crimes
in January and February.

550
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:32,473
It's April,
but he hasn't committed any crimes since.

551
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:35,768
Is this the cooling-off period
the Analysis Team mentioned?

552
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,149
Let's check the scene first.

553
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,405
Is this the place?

554
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:48,531
Yes, it is.

555
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,043
-This is way too bright.
-I know, right?

556
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,753
That's odd.

557
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:07,342
Three people with serious stab wounds
from a camping knife after being attacked.

558
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,720
All of them took place late at dawn.

559
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:13,181
All of the victims were young women.

560
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,558
The only difference is
that one was in an alley.

561
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,477
The other two were in front of houses.

562
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:22,315
They were attacked in different locations,
but having three cases with the same MO

563
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,734
implies that there might be more cases.

564
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:28,821
And all of the victims were stabbed
in their stomachs.

565
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:32,825
Do you think it's him?

566
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,244
I doubt it.

567
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,497
The weapon, MO, and time
don't match at all.

568
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,666
But they seem to have a similar build.

569
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:42,460
Right. That's why we can't be certain.

570
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:44,087
But he was a fast runner.

571
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:47,799
If he was visibly fast, I don't think
he could've done that in hiking boots.

572
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,301
Right. You can't run fast in hiking boots.

573
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,513
There's a photo of him from behind,
and we know he wore hiking boots.

574
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:54,472
He won't wear them.

575
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:55,807
But the guy we're looking for

576
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:59,352
killed victims with a blunt weapon
without giving them a chance to resist.

577
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:00,895
Even if he changed his MO,

578
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,564
I don't think he would use
such a small knife.

579
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,067
Let's say that it is him.

580
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,445
All of these assault cases
would be attempted murder cases.

581
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,905
It won't be enough for him.

582
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,366
So he wouldn't have used
the same weapon three times.

583
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:14,659
He repeated his crimes.

584
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,578
That means he didn't check
if the victim was dead, right?

585
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,664
But that doesn't change anything.

586
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:23,751
He barely left any evidence
after breaking into the houses.

587
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,087
Following his victims?

588
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,007
There could've been witnesses.
He wouldn't take risks like that

589
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,634
because he's super careful.

590
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,554
What if it's not him?

591
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,307
<i>Since all the victims were injured,</i>

592
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,894
<i>we're not looking for a murderer,
but a violent man who robs people.</i>

593
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:44,522
<i>No. He wasn't interested in valuables.
He's not a robber.</i>

594
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,816
What if it's what we speculated?

595
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,193
What if the victims were only injured…

596
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,530
because he failed to finish the job?

597
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,577
Then…

598
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,540
we have two serial killers
in this country.

599
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,026
GIRLS IN THEIR TWENTIES

600
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,831
This one didn't die either?

601
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:39,929
The same weapons were used.

602
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,266
"A camping knife"?

603
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:47,186
Look, these three locations
aren't far from one another.

604
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,105
The weapon,
where the victims were attacked,

605
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,691
and even the time.
These cases have a lot in common.

606
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:52,859
"Seriously injured…"

607
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,485
Why?

608
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,154
Is it because they aren't murders?

609
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,072
Is there something else?

610
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,243
Where are you going?

611
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,705
Captain Yoon, come here for a moment.

612
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,251
Guo-dong and Borim-dong.

613
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:14,130
These cases took place
in January and February of this year.

614
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:19,135
We believe these were done
by the culprit of the serial murders.

615
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,887
We're investigating at the moment.

616
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,306
It's not the same guy.

617
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,099
What?

618
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:28,895
It's a different guy.

619
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:31,939
His build is similar.

620
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,400
Other than that,
they have nothing else in common.

621
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:36,777
From the MO to the weapons,
everything's different.

622
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,238
Didn't you say the MO could change?

623
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:40,656
Yes, it could change.

624
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,159
But he already got a taste
of using blunt weapons.

625
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:45,703
He won't change his weapon
to something smaller.

626
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,372
Then there's less chance
this guy is a serial killer.

627
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,834
These victims didn't die.

628
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,006
Thankfully, they're alive.

629
00:36:57,089 --> 00:37:00,051
But it could actually make the culprit
even more violent.

630
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,596
We must catch him
before there's another victim.

631
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,348
What are you talking about?

632
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:08,601
This serial killer is already giving us
a huge headache.

633
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:12,313
How will we track down a murder
that hasn't even happened yet?

634
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:14,982
Let's draw a facial composite.

635
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,863
Yes, let's start with a facial composite.

636
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,490
All the victims are alive.

637
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:23,991
We have a witness too.

638
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:27,745
The victims are traumatized
and don't remember his face.

639
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,457
Let's try forensic hypnosis.

640
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,171
He has a slim face.

641
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,798
USE OF HYPNOSIS IN
THE INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS TO FIND CLUES

642
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:41,259
He has small, slanted eyes.

643
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,511
And…

644
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:45,596
Right.

645
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,724
He was somewhat bald.

646
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:52,436
Where? The forehead?

647
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,647
Yes.

648
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:03,823
NATIONAL FORENSICS SERVICE

649
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:06,367
<i>As you know, the killer isn't after money.</i>

650
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:08,911
FACIAL COMPOSITE RESULT

651
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,621
<i>If it's not about money or grudges,</i>

652
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,666
<i>there can be only one purpose.</i>

653
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:15,876
<i>Killing.</i>

654
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,261
Yes, he looked somewhat like this.

655
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:27,471
He was skinny,
so he had a slim face like this.

656
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,681
This is pretty accurate.

657
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,516
-Thank you.
-No problem.

658
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:32,768
-Thank you.
-No problem.

659
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:33,811
Let's go.

660
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:36,856
You're here.

661
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,066
Take a look at this.

662
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,777
We had the witness verify
the accuracy of this composite.

663
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:42,862
Looks good, right?

664
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:47,241
So this scum may be the one
who killed the senior citizens.

665
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,327
It's not the same guy.

666
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,370
No.

667
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:54,206
We'll continue to investigate
based on the possibility of him

668
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,291
being the same guy.

669
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:58,961
Whether it's the same guy or not,

670
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,213
we're investigating the same case,
aren't we?

671
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,175
-Yes, we are.
-Very well.

672
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,053
-Let's go through it again.
-Okay.

673
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,512
It took place late at night

674
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:13,184
under a brightly lit streetlamp.

675
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:16,103
The Borim-dong case
also took place under a streetlamp.

676
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:20,524
Normally, suspects look for
dark spots to hide.

677
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,861
And the victims were attacked
from the front, not from behind.

678
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:26,280
Did he reveal his face on purpose?

679
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,534
-Hold on. Watch this.
-Okay.

680
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,163
The victim

681
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:37,208
was walking this way.

682
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:39,752
She suddenly felt
that someone was following her.

683
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:42,088
She threw her purse,
so he'd take it and leave.

684
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,799
But he didn't care about the purse
and kept following her,

685
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:48,928
so she started walking faster, terrified.

686
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,056
The culprit must've continued
to follow her.

687
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:54,392
Then he suddenly

688
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:55,851
swung his knife at her.

689
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,835
-Hold on.
-He made her turn around on purpose.

690
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:28,259
But it could've happened
the moment she happened to turn around.

691
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,221
One commonality of these cases is that

692
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:33,722
their abdomen was stabbed.

693
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:36,934
They were stabbed from the front.

694
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,950
They took place in the southwestern part.

695
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,286
Maybe he lives in the area.

696
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,580
Why does the Special Crime Squad
think these cases

697
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:00,624
were committed by the culprit
who killed the rich senior citizens?

698
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,543
That scum targeted luxurious houses

699
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:03,836
in Gangnam and Gangbuk.

700
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,546
But as you can see on this map,

701
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,131
this isn't a rich neighborhood.

702
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,757
Let's go through everything again.

703
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,384
Our theory is that

704
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,720
he attacked the victims to kill them.

705
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:15,473
And these attacks took place

706
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,057
five times in southwestern Seoul.

707
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:21,520
That could mean he didn't know
that the victims didn't die.

708
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,981
Will his MO change
when he finds out they didn't die?

709
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,566
It's highly likely.

710
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,693
If he didn't know they didn't die,

711
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:29,904
and if that was why
he kept using the same MO,

712
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:34,116
these "attacks" could turn
into murders once he finds out.

713
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,494
In fact, that is what
I'm most worried about.

714
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,455
Then how would he find out?

715
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:42,124
Through the news
or the newspapers, probably.

716
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,376
Or he could visit the scenes again.

717
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,714
You said it rained
when the attack took place.

718
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:49,715
Yes.

719
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:54,887
You can't see clearly when it's raining,
which makes it easier

720
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,514
to commit crimes.

721
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:59,016
On top of choosing a brightly lit spot,

722
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:04,647
he purposely revealed his face. Why?

723
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:08,025
This wasn't about a personal grudge,
so why did he reveal his face?

724
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:10,694
Why? Why did he do that?

725
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,321
I really don't get it.

726
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:16,325
What time did the incident take place?

727
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:17,993
Around 9 p.m.

728
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:25,709
-Let's go back to the scene in Borim-dong.
-Yes, ma'am.

729
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:29,129
<i>So we'll check this area
every day from now on, right?</i>

730
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,422
<i>Yes.</i>

731
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:33,842
<i>Do you really think
the culprit will return to the scene?</i>

732
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,513
<i>First, we have to put ourselves
in his shoes.</i>

733
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,766
<i>Why did he choose these areas?</i>

734
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,643
<i>Did he look for easy spots</i>

735
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,103
<i>where he can attack and run?</i>

736
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:47,690
<i>Or is he familiar with this area?</i>

737
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,997
Gosh, this feels like a waste of time.

738
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,541
I feel like we're on a stakeout

739
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,544
for something that hasn't happened yet.

740
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:11,297
No, we're not. We're trying to track down

741
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,465
a serial killer

742
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,968
who has already committed murders.

743
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,598
It is the same case,

744
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:23,809
but remember that we're looking at it
from a different perspective,

745
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,686
on the premise that it's the same guy.

746
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:36,739
PUREUMAE PARK, DONGJAK-GU

747
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,259
<i>This early morning at Seoul Pureumae Park,</i>

748
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,429
<i>a woman in her twenties
was found stabbed to death.</i>

749
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,890
<i>The victim had been stabbed multiple times</i>

750
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:47,601
<i>and had already lost a lot of blood
when she was found.</i>

751
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,479
<i>People were heartbroken to hear
she passed away in the ambulance</i>

752
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:51,814
<i>on the way to the hospital.</i>

753
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:57,152
<i>The crime occurred at a blind spot
where there were no security cameras.</i>

754
00:44:57,236 --> 00:45:00,739
<i>It's been a struggle to find traces
of the culprit due to a lack of witnesses.</i>

755
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:04,368
<i>The importance of having
safety measures in parks</i>

756
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:05,536
<i>has been raised.</i>

757
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:10,582
<i>Seoul City has announced that
they will inspect the parks' streetlamps</i>

758
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,752
<i>and install more security cameras
to remove blind spots.</i>

759
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:14,837
MAP OF SEOUL

760
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,965
The Pureumae Case also occurred
in the southwestern district.

761
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,802
This happened at a park though,
not a residential street.

762
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:24,888
And the weapon wasn't
a camping knife but a kitchen knife.

763
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,683
You're seeing this as the same guy
when it's this different?

764
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,351
Or is it a third suspect?

765
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,562
Come on, just hear him out.

766
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:32,688
Carry on.

767
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:36,024
A woman in her twenties
was stabbed in the abdomen late at night.

768
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:40,028
The time of the crime and area of attack
match the other victims.

769
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:41,905
Although it's a park,

770
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,158
it's a shortcut to the residential area

771
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,201
so residents of this neighborhood

772
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,828
often use this route.

773
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,538
Why does that matter?

774
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:52,207
I'm saying, it has to be considered
a residential alley.

775
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,961
We have a description of the suspect too.

776
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:58,088
Wait, there was a witness?

777
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,256
No.

778
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:04,136
The victim gave testimony
while being transported by ambulance.

779
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:07,973
I guess…

780
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:11,018
she was alive up until then.

781
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:15,772
It was a man in his thirties,
about 170cm in height

782
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,649
with little hair,

783
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,234
dressed in dark workout clothes.

784
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:22,696
In a phone call with her boyfriend
right after the incident, she said,

785
00:46:22,779 --> 00:46:25,407
"A stranger followed me
and stabbed me with a knife."

786
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:29,161
The conversation ended with that.

787
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:30,204
Just as we feared,

788
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,498
the culprit wasn't satisfied
with his last crime.

789
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:36,710
We assumed he committed another crime
with a larger and sharper weapon.

790
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:39,546
-I still disagree.
-With what?

791
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,424
I disagree with everything
that the Analysis Team says.

792
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:45,052
Don't you think it's time
we stop being swayed by them?

793
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:49,681
-Damn it.
-Gosh, that temper of his.

794
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:51,058
Just let him be.

795
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,311
So then the Analysis Team thinks

796
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:57,231
that the culprit of the Southwest Case

797
00:46:57,314 --> 00:47:00,025
and this one is the same guy, right?

798
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:02,694
Yes. If you take a look
at the pictures from the scene,

799
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:05,155
it's neither sexual assault nor mugging.

800
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:08,534
It's a different guy from the serial
murders of the rich elderly then?

801
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:10,327
Yes.

802
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:11,870
I don't want to say this,

803
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:14,957
but we have to catch

804
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,542
two serial killers.

805
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,462
Don't blow this matter up hastily.

806
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:23,298
If we announce

807
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,927
there are two serial killers
without clear evidence,

808
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,846
the level of anxiety the public feel
will only multiply.

809
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,683
Their trust in the police will also waver.

810
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:35,727
Physical evidence found at the scene
is not the only clue.

811
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:39,022
There are bound to be traces
in the time and place he resided that day.

812
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,025
A trace that may seem trivial

813
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:44,069
becomes an important clue.

814
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:47,698
We can't only look at the weapon,
but we must expand the conditions

815
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:51,368
and look to see
if there are any similar cases.

816
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:52,327
So?

817
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:56,957
You want us to request cooperation
from the 31 police stations in Seoul?

818
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,836
I think if we can, we must do it.

819

SPECIAL CRIME SQUAD 1, TEAM 1

820
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:04,798

-Seriously?

821
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:14,099
We have so much to do.

822
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:15,517
-Gosh.
-This is nonsense.

823
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,478
<i>The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency
and the Special Crime Squad</i>

824
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:21,815
<i>held a meeting with 31 chiefs of police</i>

825
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:25,277
<i>to solve the serial attacks on women
in southwest Seoul.</i>

826
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,530
<i>They established an information room
for crimes with no motives</i>

827
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:32,284
<i>and announced they'll be increasing
cooperative investigations.</i>

<i>We are a personal bodyguard service.</i>

<i>Self-defense sprays.</i>

<i>Now offering a huge discount.</i>

832
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:44,630
<i>The reason is…</i>

833
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:47,299
<i>With violent crimes targeting women
happening consecutively</i>

834
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:49,343
<i>in the southwestern district of Seoul,</i>

835
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,887
<i>the level of anxiety has jumped
among the people.</i>

836
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:55,974
<i>Within this year, there have been

<i>It's been revealed that

<i>causing huge shock in the community.</i>

00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,939
<i>We'll connect to Reporter Kim Ju-young.</i>

<i>Past midnight

<i>Pureumae Park is looking empty</i>

<i>"I'm scared to walk alone,

-Yes.

853
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:18,724
I'll drop you off.

Gosh, it's fine.
I go there every week anyway.

855
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:23,145
It's bright outside. Don't worry.

856
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:25,105
No, I'll drop you off. Come on out.

857
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,607
My goodness. I told you, it's fine.

858
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:30,026
Please think of your servant Michael

859
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,988
whom you called away from this world.

860
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:36,199
He participated in the saint's death

861
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:37,617
through baptism.

862
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,954
So please let him
enjoy his resurrection too.

<i>The devil has yet again disappeared

00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:48,712
Please think of them

866
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:52,466
and let them meet your shining face.

00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:18,552
I'm a police officer.

874
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:21,054
Yes.

875
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:23,139
I'm a police officer.

876
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,618
"Spooky Thursdays."

877
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:46,121
They've stopped night studies
at girls' high schools.

878
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,499
I have nightmares every night
because I'm worried

879
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:50,876
this may end up a cold case.

880
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,504
I think the world is becoming strange.

881
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:55,839
Seriously.

882
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,341
I feel like I'm running in circles.

883
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,305
What does he want to nag about now?

884
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:05,348
Yes?

885
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,517
Where are you, Young-soo?
Hurry up and come in.

886
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,603
<i>-Why?</i>
-I think we caught that bastard.

887
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:12,188
"That bastard"? Which one?

888
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:14,649
That bastard forged your ID card.

889
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:16,693
Forged ID card?
What are you talking about?

890
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:18,987
The one I lost four years ago?

891
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,697
Damn it! Just shut up and come.

892
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,533
The serial killer
of the wealthy senior citizen case…

893
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,577
We caught that scum!

894
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:28,747
Turn the car around, Ha-young.

895
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:37,672
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

896
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:41,444
PERSONAL INFORMATION

897
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:44,114
You arrested him as a suspect
of a sex worker's abduction?

898
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:45,031
Yes.

899
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:48,368
The women on the staff
couldn't be reached.

900
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,829
The pimp reported him
after much suspicion.

901
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:53,665
He was arrested around 5:30 a.m. today.

902
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,292
Mapo Police Station is done investigating

903
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,128
culprit Gu Young-chun's phone,

904
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:00,547
as well as articles
from the missing women.

905
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:04,009
We're also searching
through the car of the victim

906
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:05,218
who went missing two days ago.

907
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:07,429
What about the missing victims?

908
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,765
"I killed them. I didn't."

909
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,142
"I buried them. I didn't."

910
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:13,893
His statement is inconsistent.

911
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,729
Anyway, how did Chief Kim Bong-sik

912
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,772
end up catching him too?

913
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:20,316
The owner of the business, Kwak Man-hyun,

914
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,610
is an acquaintance of Chief Kim Bong-sik.

915
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,489
That's why he's not showing up?

916
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:29,117
Anyway,

917
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,661
are you sure that guy
said he did all those things

918
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,163
to the elderly people?

919
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:34,539
Yes, I think so.

920
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:37,667
But he kept going off speaking nonsense

921
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:39,210
on our way here.

922
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:46,801
What do you think, Inspector Song?

923
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:49,721
We should check

924
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:52,515
if he's mentally ill
or has personality disorders.
