1
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,547
<i>Are you investigating this case
as a serial murder?</i>

2
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,508
It's too early to confirm that.

3
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,968
As you know,

4
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,804
these murders took place
in different districts.

5
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,599
It's been over a month
since the Suseong-dong incident.

6
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,267
You still haven't made any progress?

7
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,186
The detectives in those districts
and the Special Crime Squad

8
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,520
are doing their best.

9
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,564
Are you sure this isn't a serial murder?

10
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,444
Everyone, please.

11
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,571
Don't jump to conclusions.

12
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,615
You'll only scare the public.

13
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,992
I heard the MO for all three cases
was the same.

14
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,619
And your answer is still a no?

15
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,245
Just look at these murders.

16
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,706
Are you sure
there weren't any accomplices?

17
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,626
Is there a reason behind
not treating this as a serial murder?

18
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,128
Since the incidents
took place in different districts,

19
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,963
they couldn't have been a one-man job.

20
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,206
You dropped this.

21
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,012
-I'm sorry.
-Jeez.

22
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,818
What's going on?

23
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,534
Here it is.

24
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:40,702
Hello?

25
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:44,873
It's an alarm.

26
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:50,920
<i>Just last September,</i>

27
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,214
<i>there were three break-ins
that led to murders.</i>

28
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,341
<i>But the police still haven't
found a suspect</i>

29
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,927
-Kitty, slow down. Okay?
<i>-which is alarming the public.</i>

30
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,347
<i>The police announced that
they are taking various approaches</i>

31
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,725
<i>to investigate these three murder cases.</i>

32
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,059
<i>Some people are suggesting</i>

33
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,062
<i>that the culprit targeted
wealthy senior citizens.</i>

34
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:12,191
<i>But the police stated that grouping
individual cases into one serial case</i>

35
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,818
<i>was a risky move.</i>

36
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,904
<i>-Without any definitive proof,</i>
-Take this.

37
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,655
<i>-the police dispatched</i>
-What's that?

38
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,867
<i>more resources to question more people
and focus more on legwork.</i>

39
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,077
<i>-But they haven't found a lead yet.</i>
-Okay.

40
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,079
<i>The police are open to other possibilities</i>

41
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,666
<i>such as robberies or crimes of passion
by the victims' acquaintances.</i>

42
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,419
<i>And the police are following up
on other possibilities.</i>

43
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,938
Listen. Detectives like us

44
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,774
who do all the legwork catch the culprits.

45
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,734
When we were canvassing

46
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,737
these neighborhoods
to the point that we got blisters,

47
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,697
what did those district cops do?

48
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,867
Yes. I'm glad you brought that up.
Where were you in all of this?

49
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,869
Right. You were at a sauna.

50
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,621
I went there once!

51
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,039
Yes. I know that.

52
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,499
You went to the sauna once,
the go club once,

53
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,875
and the Internet cafe once.

54
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,420
Are you having fun playing computer games
with high schoolers when you're 40?

55
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,757
Do you think she's the type
to tell on people?

56
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,468
You punk. I have ears too.

57
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:25,473
I think it's necessary to set boundaries
between our squad and the Analysis Team.

58
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,809
Right. That's my point.

59
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,853
They just wear suits and act all cool.

60
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,064
They just have meetings
like some scholars.

61
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,524
What do you think they can do?

62
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,401
As long as they can pinpoint a suspect,

63
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:40,113
it doesn't matter if they have meetings
like scholars or standing on their heads.

64
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,322
What do you care?

65
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,909
Entering the crime scene as they please
is obstructing the investigation.

66
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,079
Captain Kook isn't
Chief of Forensics anymore.

67
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:51,124
And Song Ha-young was always
into playing the hero.

68
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,918
He keeps crossing the line.
You know how he is.

69
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,337
I won't participate
in making personal attacks.

70
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:57,797
What?

71
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,885
Other teams aren't happy with
the Behavioral Analysis Team.

72
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,263
If there are no boundaries
between us and them,

73
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:09,017
whenever we get cases,
there's bound to be conflict.

74
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,059
Listen.

75
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,353
They are taking the lead on their own.

76
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,981
-How can I stop them?
-Gosh.

77
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,192
Besides, they aren't really
getting in your way.

78
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,445
They can actually help you out.

79
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,281
Goodness.
Did you all have coffee this morning?

80
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,408
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

81
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,036
Come on! What's the matter with you?

82
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,913
What's going on in there?

83
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,833
It's too early to be yelling at this hour.

84
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,543
Well, the thing is…

85
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,503
Yesterday, when Chief Kim Bong-sik

86
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,255
<i>went to check out
the area in Jinjung-dong,</i>

87
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:40,840
<i>he ran into Inspector Song.</i>

88
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,884
Darn it, that little…

89
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,179
Gosh.

90
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,681
-It's…
<i>-Captain Yoon and I</i>

91
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,893
<i>also run into him whenever we go
to Suseong-dong or Gungok-dong.</i>

92
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:56,314
It seems like Inspector Song is
visiting all the scenes on a daily basis,

93
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:59,192
so people are talking.

94
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,445
-Captain Yoon.
-Yes, sir.

95
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,906
As police officers,
it is our job to catch criminals.

96
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,200
Whether he's trying to play a hero or not,

97
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,869
let's not doubt his genuine intentions.

98
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,497
I don't doubt his intentions.

99
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,754
-Hello, sir.
-What's going on?

100
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,883
The Behavioral Analysis Team
reports directly to me.

101
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,676
What's your problem?

102
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,346
If you have a problem, talk to me.

103
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:31,099
It's not a big deal, sir.
There was a misunderstanding.

104
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,476
Ban the Analysis Team
from entering the scenes.

105
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,894
Oh, that's what you want?

106
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:36,979
That's it?

107
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:40,691
Sure, fine.

108
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,985
If you have a problem with that,

109
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,113
I'll be sure to let them know.

110
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,823
-Thank you, sir.
-But the thing is,

111
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,451
I can't stop them if they want
to conduct their own investigation.

112
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:53,788
They're cutting down on sleep to do that

113
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,249
on top of conscientiously
completing their own tasks,

114
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,960
so I can't tell them not to do that.

115
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,337
I can't dictate how much sleep they get.

116
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,297
Right, they're not kids.

117
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,967
We're not asking you
to just go ahead and stop them.

118
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:11,472
The Analysis Team needs to understand
that they're not an investigation team.

119
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,559
Right, I also think…

120
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,228
What's going on?

121
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,567
<i>Hurry to the scene in Hwanghwa-dong.</i>

122
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,528
<i>A senior citizen was murdered.
Hurry to the scene at once.</i>

123
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,321
-Let's hurry.
-Come on.

124
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,824
Oh, I see. Got it.

125
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,451
-It's urgent.
-Okay.

126
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,910
It's in Hwanghwa-dong!

127
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,708
Come on.

128
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,335
-Hey, get the car ready!
-Yes, sir!

129
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,185
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

130
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:13,701
Gosh, I didn't know that
so many people were into hiking.

131
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,621
I did this all day yesterday,
and I don't see an end in sight.

132
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,667
I'll become a hiking expert at this rate.

133
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,921
Hey, those in Forensics have it way worse.

134
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,299
Their hands have already turned into feet,

135
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,760
so they walk on all fours now. Like this.

136
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,310
Can't you laugh even if it's not funny?

137
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,856
Did he have to storm out like that?

138
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,317
What would you like for lunch?

139
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,319
You've gotten quite brazen, Chu Chu.

140
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,553
SPECIAL CRIME SQUAD 1

141
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,234
Did something happen?

142
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:31,070
Another senior citizen was murdered
in Hwanghwa-dong.

143
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,197
They all went to the scene
a little while ago.

144
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,958
Goodness. Hey! Get it done properly!

145
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,294
-Sir, you can't come in here.
-Why not?

146
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,379
-Go the other way.
-This is crazy.

147
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:49,839
-Go the other way!
-Darn it.

148
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,966
I didn't mean to offend you.

149
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,844
I just said to go the other way.
Gosh, this is so frustrating.

150
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,638
Guys, keep the residents out.

151
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,767
{\an8}-Sir! You can't come in here.
-Why not?

152
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,146
This is nuts.

153
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,109
You can't come in here.

154
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,986
-You can't come in here.
-Gosh. Move.

155
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,446
Gosh, what is this?

156
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,993
Chief! You can't touch that.
You know you can't touch anything here.

157
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,203
We're still trying to lift prints.

158
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,831
-You can't touch that.
-You can't come in here.

159
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,291
-No, stop!
-My goodness.

160
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,792
-Don't touch anything.
-Darn it.

161
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,128
-Get out.
-Get rid of this stench first, idiot!

162
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:32,089
-You're contaminating the scene.
-Darn it. Let go!

163
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,342
Gosh.

164
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,261
-There he is.
-Hey.

165
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,015
Hey, how did the fire break out?

166
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,100
The culprit tried
to set the house on fire.

167
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:46,395
Thankfully, it died out after burning
a part of the body and the ceiling.

168
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,314
Then maybe it was someone else.

169
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,941
We'd have to look into it further,
but a blunt weapon was used.

170
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,862
The triangle again?

171
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,113
{\an8}FORENSICS

172
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,199
Gosh, this is insane.

173
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,868
What is happening?

174
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,370
Then why did he start the fire?

175
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,081
Maybe there was something
he wanted to hide.

176
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,083
We're looking into that too.

177
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,753
I'll collect statements from the bereaved
at the station.

178
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:11,879
Okay, sure.

179
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,090
How long will this take?

180
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,802
There was a fire,
so I'd say about ten hours.

181
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,553
What's Kim Bong-sik doing inside?

182
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,680
I have no idea. Why is he…

183
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:25,726
I'll lift all his prints
and submit them as evidence.

184
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,478
-Darn it.
-All right, I'm sorry.

185
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,021
-Keep it up.
-Get back to work.

186
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,022
-Keep it up.
-Thank you.

187
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,567
-What is going on?
-Hey.

188
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,985
-Gil-pyo.
-Yes.

189
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,946
I told you not to smoke
and contaminate the scenes.

190
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,781
I'm just frustrated.
They said it'd take ten hours.

191
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,158
Frustrated, my foot.
How many of these did we find last time?

192
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,577
Do you want to end up
on the list of suspects again?

193
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,747
-Are you here to nag me or what?
-Whatever. Anyway, what happened?

194
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,874
It's being investigated now.

195
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,835
We're waiting too.

196
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,962
You guys in the Analysis Team
should return to the office.

197
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,090
-How can we return to the office?
-Gosh, seriously.

198
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,174
Captain Kook.

199
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,094
Chief Kim Bong-sik is inside.

200
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,512
He's inside?

201
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,514
-Kim Bong-sik, this little…
-Hey, stop.

202
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:04,890
This is wrong.

203
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,309
You're no longer in the Forensics Squad.

204
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,270
You know that Kim Bong-sik likes to talk.

205
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,397
Look, many eyes are watching.

206
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,233
If people start to complain
about your team frequenting the scenes,

207
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,526
things will get complicated for all of us.

208
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,611
Both you and Superintendent Baek are here.

209
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:18,904
Why should I walk on eggshells around him?

210
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,449
We can't have your back forever.

211
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,826
The two teams must respect
each other's boundaries.

212
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,953
You were the one
who came up with this system.

213
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,581
Exactly.
Just go back to the office and wait.

214
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:31,375
We'll share all the updates with you.

215
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,294
Why must we argue about this now?

216
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:36,088
-Just go back to the office.
-I'm so angry right now.

217
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,216
Why is he standing there alone,
looking all serious?

218
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,346
Let's go for a smoke.

219
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,182
Sure, let's go.

220
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,559
-Go somewhere far.
-I can smoke over there, right?

221
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,394
-Not within a 50m-radius.
-All right.

222
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,815
-There must've been an arson attempt.
-Yes, there's the burning smell.

223
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,401
Who's the victim?

224
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,821
A female in her 60s.

225
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,408
A quiet alley
in an affluent residential area.

226
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,578
I don't see a single security camera.

227
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,747
But an arson attempt. That's a first.

228
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,458
It was premeditated, right?

229
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,836
Yes. But something is off.

230
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,463
What's odd?

231
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,298
The first incident took place
on September 12.

232
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,425
The second one on the 24th.
The third one on the 30th.

233
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,762
The interval between the cases
has gone down from 12 to 6 days.

234
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,014
But it has increased to a month.

235
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,683
If this really is
a premeditated serial murder case,

236
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,603
such decreased intervals
and sporadic patterns

237
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,482
mean that the killer is becoming bolder.

238
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:42,363
However, it took the killer a month
to commit this murder.

239
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,784
There must've been a reason.

240
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,577
What could it be?

241
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,126
Was it suicide?

242
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,254
What caused the fire?
Was it attempted arson?

243
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,214
-Move back.
-Did the fire kill the victim?

244
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,632
-Or was it murder?
-Move back!

245
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,343
-Have you identified a suspect?
-Yoon Tae-gu from Seoul HQ?

246
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,554
There have been many murders lately.
What's your plan?

247
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,394
Was the victim murdered?

248
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:14,937
Just a comment, please!

249
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,106
-What exactly happened?
-Tell us!

250
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,608
-Is this a homicide case?
-Tell us!

251
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:23,571
<i>Earlier today, at around 11:10 a.m.
on Thursday, October 30,</i>

252
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,364
Yoon Jung-yoon, a 65-year-old female,

253
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,783
was found dead in her home
in Hwanghwa-dong, Seoul.

254
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,203
She was attacked with a blunt weapon.

255
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,705
Her husband, Han Jong-yong,

256
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,124
saw that their house was filled with smoke

257
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,209
upon returning home from work

258
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,752
and called it in.

259
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,671
What was used to start the fire?

260
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,007
We believe that the culprit used

261
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,217
newspaper and paper to start the fire.

262
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,510
Any lead on the culprit?

263
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,471
We can't tell you anything at the moment.

264
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,098
We're restricting access to the scene

265
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:54,393
as we wait for the Forensics Squad's
preliminary results,

266
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:58,606
so I hope you understand we can't share
any details with you at the moment.

267
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,983
Were any cash or valuables
stolen from the scene?

268
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,235
How did she get in here?

269
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,403
At the moment,

270
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,488
it doesn't seem like anything was stolen.

271
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,782
Do you still think it was done
by an acquaintance of the victim?

272
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:12,244
We are considering every possibility.

273
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,662
As I mentioned earlier,

274
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,831
we're still waiting
for the preliminary results--

275
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,833
Do you admit that
this may be connected to the cases

276
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,752
that occurred in Suseong-dong,
Gungok-dong, and Jinjung-dong?

277
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,297
Serial murders targeting
affluent senior citizens.

278
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,798
Do you admit it?

279
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,800
Well about that…

280
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:30,054
We plan to expand the investigation
keeping in mind

281
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,890
the possibility that
the culprit could be the same person.

282
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,059
Do you think there was an accomplice
like the Jijon Family case?

283
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,685
There wasn't any accomplice?

284
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,145
Are they related?

285
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:41,023
-Do you have any speculations?
-Are the cases related?

286
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,025
Excuse me, reporters. I apologize.

287
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,902
I'm sure you have more questions,

288
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,904
but that's all for today's briefing.

289
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:50,199
We will do our best to arrest the culprit,

290
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,659
so please give us some time.

291
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:52,910
Thank you.

292
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,119
-Where are you going?
-That's it?

293
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,747
-Are those done by the same guy?
-Is everything related?

{\an8}POLICE ADMITS ELDERLY MURDERS
AS SERIAL KILLING

306
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,882
FORENSICS

307
00:16:58,475 --> 00:16:59,977
Why did he suddenly start a fire?

308
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,396
He's never done that before.

309
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:05,858
Did you find any inflammable?

310
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,527
-Check out this area first.
-All right.

311
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,287
He didn't prepare anything in particular.

312
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,539
I think it started with a newspaper.

313
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,374
If he didn't bring any inflammable,

314
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,792
I don't think he sought after

315
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,669
psychological exhilaration
as most arsonists do.

316
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,047
If he was after
psychological exhilaration,

317
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,466
he would've stayed
and watched the fire grow.

318
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,842
You're right.

319
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,970
I'm sure he came across
an unexpected situation.

320
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,348
He either wanted
to destroy unwanted traces

321
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,809
or it could've been his trace.

322
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:45,606
He failed to open the safe.

323
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,150
Maybe this was a copycat crime.

324
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,402
He wasn't keen on taking
the valuables until now.

325
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,154
But he used the same weapon.

326
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,241
Triangular?

327
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,331
Then let's check the body first.

328
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,589
<i>He destroyed the cross.</i>

329
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,966
<i>An unnecessary act.</i>

330
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,349
Mallet. Hammer. Brick.

331
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,559
We took everything we could find

332
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,020
to see if any of them
could leave a triangular mark,

333
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:26,897
but none of them did.

334
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,857
Do you think he made the weapon himself?

335
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,192
The murder weapon?

336
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,777
I mean, we can't seem to find it.

337
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,488
His choice of a blunt weapon
rather than a sharp one

338
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,116
shows the anger built within the culprit.

339
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,203
What made him become this furious

340
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,873
to brutally kill complete strangers?

341
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,418
-Let's check.
-May I borrow a notebook?

342
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,756
-Thank you.
-First off, the front.

343
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,425
One, two, three, four.

344
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,303
On the head, one…

345
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,983
<i>He isn't after money.</i>

346
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,443
<i>It wasn't done by an acquaintance
who holds a grudge.</i>

347
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,612
<i>In that case,</i>

348
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,534
<i>where did his anger
that ultimately made him attack</i>

349
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,996
<i>these helpless wealthy victims stem from?</i>

350
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,332
Are you sure?

351
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,001
Last night,

352
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:32,129
he wanted to put that jacket on,
but he changed into something else,

353
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,298
then left it on the sofa before he left.

354
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,055
But come morning,

355
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,599
the jacket was gone.

356
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,560
Maybe the victim moved it somewhere.

357
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,937
So I asked the chief of Forensics
to find it first.

358
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,981
He looked for it twice,
but it wasn't there.

359
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,568
He left the money and valuables.

360
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:58,530
All he took was a black jacket?

361
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,699
It suddenly got chilly this morning.

362
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,454
This is such a shame.

363
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,540
If we had cameras in the alleys,
we would've found him by now.

364
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:12,085
We put up many more
at the beginning of this year.

365
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,963
When we never had them,
I never thought about it,

366
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,924
but I guess I began to feel this way
now that we have some.

367
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:20,052
They're making
the control center next year.

368
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,303
Hopefully, things will change.

369
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,430
Over there.

370
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,437
They're all wearing black.

371
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,773
But it's just a day's worth.

372
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,652
-Find someone in hiking boots.
-Okay.

373
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:41,365
He carried a big weapon around,
so I'll find someone with a backpack too.

374
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,741
Once you screen them,

375
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,702
ask the husband
if it's the jacket he lost.

376
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:46,745
Yes.

377
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,539
Goodness, Reporter Im Moo-sik.

378
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,292
I always gave you the information.

379
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,380
If we find anything,
I'll let you know first.

380
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,216
Hey, wait.

381
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,302
<i>Why? Did you find something?</i>

382
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,392
GUNGOK-DONG, HWANGHWA-DONG

383
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,727
Man, look at this guy.

384
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:11,937
SUSEONG-DONG, JINJUNG-DONG

385
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,564
-I'll call you back.
<i>-One second.</i>

386
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:18,735
Gil-pyo!

387
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:23,240
-This jerk.
-What? Did you find anything?

388
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,491
Listen up.

389
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,535
Suseong.

390
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:28,787
Gungok.

391
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,331
Jinjung. Hwanghwa.

392
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:35,043
-What about them?
-They have the same consonants.

393
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,212
Darn it.
Explain it so that I can understand.

394
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,964
Suseong. S and S.

395
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,632
Gungok. G and G.

396
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,676
-Jinjung.
-J and J.

397
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:45,053
-Hwanghwa.
-H and H!

398
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:51,768
Look, they are all located
in places with good access.

399
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,146
Not only are there
luxurious residential districts,

400
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,732
but the towns also have a concentrated
area of adult entertainment businesses

401
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,900
that are accessible by public transport.

402
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,027
So what?

403
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,195
The investigation team says
he must've gone around in a car

404
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,905
because he was never seen

405
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,615
even though he committed
the crimes in a large area.

406
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,326
But it might be the opposite.

407
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,328
Oh, he uses public transit?

408
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,997
In-tak said
there's a jacket missing, right?

409
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,917
Yes, if that's true,
it's another proof for our second theory.

410
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,420
The temperature dropped this morning,

411
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:21,590
so if he didn't have a car,
he would've needed a jacket or something.

412
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,759
We can make another assumption.

413
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,177
What is it?

414
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,096
He could've needed to hide
his bloodstained clothes.

415
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,640
If that's the case,

416
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,185
then shouldn't we have
many more witnesses?

417
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,728
I mean, he used public transit.

418
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:37,355
<i>Even if he went around
with bloodstained clothes,</i>

419
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,566
<i>most people wouldn't have noticed</i>

420
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,235
<i>unless they saw him near the crime scene.</i>

421
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,446
<i>Right, you're right.</i>

422
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,074
<i>He wouldn't go around
telling people he's a murderer.</i>

423
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,408
Also, surprisingly,

424
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,120
people aren't too interested in others.

425
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,122
Due to their inattentiveness,

426
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:57,459
they wouldn't get suspicious
nor perceive it as strange

427
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,420
even if they saw his bloody clothes,
just as Hwang Dae-sun said.

428
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,547
Right.

429
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,888
GUNGOK-DONG, HWANGHWA-DONG,
SUSEONG-DONG, JINJUNG-DONG

430
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,979
RESTRICTED AREA
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

431
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,860
That man. Is that the jacket?

432
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,202
Hello?

433
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,038
Yes, Chief.

434
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,672
CHIEF OH IN-TAK OF FORENSICS

435
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,591
To sum up,
the culprit probably doesn't have a car,

436
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:50,387
and he's a guy with a shoe size
between 260mm to 265mm?

437
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,056
One second.

438
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,686
Hello, Captain Kook Young-soo
of Behavioral Analysis…

439
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,895
Hey, In-tak.

440
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:00,480
All right.

441
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,608
Fax it over right away. Thanks.

442
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,113
We can stop looking for the shoes.

443
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,073
They found it?

444
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,409
-Which brand is it?
-He'll fax it to me.

445
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,625
Wait, how does this make any sense?

446
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,211
Why doesn't it? It fits perfectly.

447
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,922
Have you found any evidence
more trustworthy than this?

448
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,217
You should dispatch some men
in Bangbae-dong.

449
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,303
You need to stop the fifth murder!

450
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,374
You're all here. Take a look at this.

451
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,626
-What?
-You found something?

452
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:03,877
The hiking shoes…

453
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:06,922
Why do you have this?

454
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:10,008
If you want to get cranky,
you should do your job first.

455
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:11,968
I don't want any inconvenience either.

456
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,137
What is it?

457
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,932
Darn it, the chief of Forensics
is doing his job weirdly.

458
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,433
Not as much as you, Chief.

459
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,394
-What?
-You're with the superintendent.

460
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:24,022
-Okay.
-Over here. This one.

461
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:24,981
We found him.

462
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,400
Yes, but you're a step too late.

463
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:28,944
It's CCTV footage.

464
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,363
We got a shot of the back of the culprit.

465
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:44,000
What are we supposed to do with that?

466
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:47,504
We're still in a tight spot
with or without leads.

467
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,923
We won't be able
to find anything with that.

468
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,216
<i>Come to the conference room.</i>

469
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,426
<i>We caught the back of the culprit
on a security camera.</i>

470
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,768
Did you forget something?

471
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,312
-Should I go and fetch it now?
-No. Wait.

472
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,025
It's not his face. It's his back.

473
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,528
Right. Yes.

474
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:15,782
Let's dispatch some people
to Bangbae-dong.

475
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:18,952
And why don't we interrogate those
with the same shoes in the area?

476
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,996
There will be countless people who own

477
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,540
the same hiking shoes
of the same size just in Seoul.

478
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,917
We won't be able to track people
who bought them in cash.

479
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,962
We should start with the neighborhoods
like we're taking a census.

480
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,339
I think doing the legwork will be better.

481
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,716
It's not just one neighborhood.

482
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,677
As you know, these murders
took place all over Seoul.

483
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,264
Sir, why are we going to Bangbae-dong?

484
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,349
What? Oh, that?

485
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:47,897
All right. Listen up.

486
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,858
Suseong. Gungok.

487
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,609
Jinjung. Hwanghwa.

488
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,153
Anything?

489
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,157
You idiots.

490
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,492
S and S. G and G.

491
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,578
The syllables start
with the same consonants.

492
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,000
Let's put out an APB.

493
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,170
What nonsense is that?

494
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,588
We must put out an APB.

495
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:14,049
How could we put out an APB
with just that?

496
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,885
Come on in. You're here so join us.

497
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:20,847
And take us step by step.

498
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:25,393
We must broadcast it nationally
on the nine o'clock news.

499
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:28,897
He's driving me crazy. Come on.

500
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,940
But we know nothing about the guy.

501
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,818
You want us to do that with
the footage that shows his back?

502
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,488
Having the footage of his back
won't make any difference.

503
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:39,282
About 99 percent of the tips
we receive won't be useful.

504
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,743
Then it will only complicate
our investigation.

505
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,329
But while he keeps a low profile,

506
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,122
we can buy time.

507
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,457
I think it's a good idea.

508
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,418
The cooling-off period was long between
the third and fourth cases because…

509
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,462
Wait. What's a cooling-off period?

510
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:55,173
It's a hiatus for serial killers.

511
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,008
Hey, he didn't ask you.

512
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,510
Come on.

513
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:02,597
It took a month for him
to commit the fourth murder

514
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,140
because of the press.

515
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,475
What about the press?

516
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:08,895
Up to the third case,
his cooling-off period was shortened

517
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:10,313
because he was confident.

518
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:11,940
-What's going on?
<i>-But the press</i>

519
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,775
<i>raised suspicions of serial murder.</i>

520
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,985
<i>And they started to pay attention
to each case individually.</i>

521
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,197
<i>The moment he became confident,</i>

522
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,991
<i>he hesitated in case he might get caught.</i>

523
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,704
But he killed again.

524
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,794
It means that the pleasure from killing

525
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,380
and his confidence overweighed
his fear of getting caught.

526
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,841
You're saying that
there could be another victim?

527
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:41,636
Yes. He only hesitated. He didn't stop.

528
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,100
Even if he kills again,
it won't be easy to catch him.

529
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:49,394
That arrogant jerk.

530
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,396
Chief Kim Bong-sik.

531
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:54,232
Do I have to teach you
how to respect your colleagues?

532
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,819
He's aware of his crimes

533
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,654
and our investigation progress.

534
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:00,905
He's smart.

535
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:09,539
Don't tell me you're buying this nonsense.

536
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:12,375
The culprit will watch
the broadcast somewhere.

537
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,879
-He pays attention to the press.
-So…

538
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:19,340
are you suggesting
that we give him a warning

539
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,259
that he could get caught?

540
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,803
That's correct.

541
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:27,348
He has already committed four murders.

542
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,975
He won't stop here.

543
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,770
The only way to prevent him
from committing the next murder…

544
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,356
is this.

545
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,985
Stop him from striking again…

546
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:49,537
But we should consider this
as making progress, right?

547
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,539
We found the hiking shoes.

548
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,334
And we got his back on camera.
I'm sure we'll find him soon.

549
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,586
Everyone is working together.
He can't get away.

550
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:57,962
You're right.

551
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:01,674
-Chu Chu, we'll give you a ride.
-No. It's okay. I can take the bus.

552
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,968
-We have room. Let me drop you.
-Yes.

553
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,678
No. It's in a different direction.

554
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,555
Taking the bus is more comfortable.

555
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:11,559
Okay. I get it. You want to get away
from us as soon as possible.

556
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:12,644
See you tomorrow.

557
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:13,770
-Okay. Goodnight.
-Okay.

558
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,522
-Get home safely.
-Goodnight.

559
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:16,773
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,363
MURDER CASE IN HWANGHWA-DONG

562
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:26,616
Do you seriously believe
putting out an APB will work?

563
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:30,787
Why not?

564
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,872
With just that?

565
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:34,833
You really should

566
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,710
learn to listen to your colleagues.

567
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,087
What?

568
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,214
He wants to use this as a warning

569
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,717
to stop the next murder.

570
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,720
I thought everyone understood that.

571
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:48,847
But I guess you didn't.

572
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,807
A warning? As if.

573
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,017
Do you think our duty is to scare people?

574
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,354
If you can't understand this,

575
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,898
following the majority is also a way.

576
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,484
Hey.

577
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:06,239
I've been too nice to you.
How dare you talk to me like that?

578
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:09,075
I really hope you will stop
being nice to me.

579
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:14,539
Your personality hasn't changed one bit.
I bet you'll live a long life. Right?

580
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,125
What did you say?

581
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,751
I'm your fellow detective.

582
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,088
But you still treat me like a woman.

583
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,591
Narrow-minded, shallow,
biased, and immature.

584
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,634
That's how your perception is.

585
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:31,389
Gosh. You are also trying
to ruffle up my feathers today.

586
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:34,475
And are you cool with ruffling up
other people's feathers?

587
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,352
You little…

588
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:40,773
Did you see that?

589
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,150
If you weren't a woman,

590
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,360
I would have slapped you right away.

591
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,237
I'm not slapping you because you're a--

592
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,745
This is my answer…

593
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:56,873
to what you did to me before.

594
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,960
I thought I was over it.

595
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:03,838
I guess I wasn't.

596
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:12,138
Hey, Yoon Tae-gu!

597
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,682
If you don't want to be
treated like a woman,

598
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,852
cut your hair that you've insisted
on growing for the victims!

599
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,437
Darn it!

600
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,044
So I pushed for it.

601
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,046
Do you think putting out an APB will work?

602
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,174
If he hides,
it will be harder to find him.

603
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,010
You have a point.

604
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:54,222
But stopping the next murder
is our top priority right now.

605
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:57,517
Right. That's true.

606
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,643
Yes.

607
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:00,770
Drop me off here.

608
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:02,146
-Here?
-Yes.

609
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:05,316
-Good work.
-Thanks. Bye.

610
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,693
-See you tomorrow.
-Okay.

611
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,071
Gosh.

612
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,657
-Captain Kook.
-Yes?

613
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,866
Hold on.

614
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,784
What?

615
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,244
Wait. I have something.

616
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:21,082
My mother gave it to me this morning.
But I forgot about it all day. I'm sorry.

617
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,668
What is this? Why are you apologizing?

618
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:26,045
This is a present from me.

619
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,338
Happy birthday.

620
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,507
Me? Today is…

621
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,636
Goodness.

622
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,305
Hey, I'm an old man.
I don't need presents.

623
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:39,392
People in our line of work
only memorize crime dates.

624
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,019
We always forget birthdays.

625
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,146
Anyway, thank you.

626
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:46,232
And please thank your mother for me too.

627
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:47,817
-Sure.
-You're making me blush.

628
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,361
-Gosh. Thanks. I mean it.
-Sure.

629
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,279
Okay.

630
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,161
Song Ha-young is a nice gifter.

631
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,418
Happy birthday to me.

632
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,470
Oh, right.

633
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,930
Sorry, honey.

634
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,432
-I…
<i>-Happy birthday, honey.</i>

635
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,851
-<i>Happy birthday, Dad.</i>
-<i>Happy birthday, Dad.</i>

636
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:26,856
-<i>Happy birthday to you</i>
-<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

637
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:29,317
-<i>Happy birthday to you, dear Dad</i>
-<i>Happy birthday to you, dear my husband</i>

638
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,319
-<i>Happy birthday to you</i>
-<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

639
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,448
-Goodness. Thank you.
<i>-Make a wish now.</i>

640
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,283
<i>Dad, you need to make a wish.</i>

641
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:39,619
Okay, hold on.

642
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,467
<i>-Did you do it?
-What did you wish for?</i>

643
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,468
It's a secret.

644
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:56,552
<i>-Come on.
-Come on.</i>

645
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:59,388
<i>I'm glad we got to wish you
a happy birthday before midnight.</i>

646
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:00,890
I know. Thank you.

647
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:02,892
<i>-I love you.
-I love you, Dad.</i>

648
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:06,521
-<i>And I miss you.</i>
-Me too. I love you too.

649
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,573
Daddy's wish is…

650
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:34,090
<i>But we know nothing about the guy.</i>

651
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,968
<i>You want us to do that with
the footage that shows his back?</i>

652
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:40,555
Having the footage of his back
won't make any difference.

653
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:43,349
About 99 percent of the tips
we receive won't be useful.

654
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:45,768
Then it will only complicate
our investigation.

655
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,854
Do you think putting out an APB will work?

656
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:51,023
If he hides,
it will be harder to find him.

657
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,569
<i>Did we make the right decision?</i>

-Send it right away.
-I'm telling you. That's why.

664
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,545
We will put out an APB.

665
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:46,597
Attention, please.

666
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:48,474
Hold on a moment.

667
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:52,645
The phones will keep ringing off the hook.

668
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,564
I know things will get hectic,

669
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,943
but don't dismiss any info
you obtain through these calls.

670
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:02,446
If you hear anything suspicious,
let us know.

671
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:06,158
Please remember that we must prioritize
the calls from our tippers

672
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,785
over the ones from the reporters.

673
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,871
Now, back to your calls.
I don't need your answer.

674
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,124
Hello?

675
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,709
-Yes.
-That's right.

676
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:17,503
-Yes, from now on…
-Is that right?

677
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:20,047
-As for the case…
-I'll take care of that.

678
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:25,344
<i>The footage shows a man
in a black jacket walking.</i>

679
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:28,306
<i>He takes a look around, looking relaxed.</i>

680
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,934
<i>The police have identified
the man in the footage</i>

681
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:34,270
<i>as the prime suspect in the case.</i>

682
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:39,066
<i>The jacket he is wearing matches the one
that is missing from the scene.</i>

683
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,987
<i>And he was caught on this camera
immediately after the incident took place.</i>

684
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,781
<i>According to the police,
the size of this man's shoe print</i>

685
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,658
<i>matches that of the shoe print</i>

686

<i>found at the scene
of the senior citizen's murder.</i>

687

<i>The MO seems similar as well,</i>

688
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,458
<i>so the possibility
that the killer is the same person…</i>

689
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:03,049
How are you feeling? Better?

690
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:06,010
Gosh, the commissioner was so mean to me.

691
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,136
-Gosh.
-Last night,

692
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,805
when I went to his office
to get his approval on the APB,

693
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:12,099
he kept hitting me
on the back of the head,

694
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,643
asking how we'll catch the killer
with this alone.

695
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,062
I'm almost 50 now.

696
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,439
Gosh. He just can't quit
that habit of his, can he?

697
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,151
I stayed up all night and managed
to persuade the commissioner,

698
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,613
but what will happen to us
if this doesn't work?

699
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,199
Well, it can't be undone now.

700
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,619
Don't be scared.

701
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,788
Let's wait and see what happens.

702
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,332
The reporters are
getting a thrill out of this.

703
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:39,210
They're watching us with their eyes peeled
to see if we'll catch him

704
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,462
with this photo that shows
nothing but his back.

705
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:44,256
Come on, Chief Heo.
Why are you being like this?

706
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,717
Are you suddenly regretting your decision?

707
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,220
No, it's not that.
I'm just frustrated. That's all.

708
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:53,099
It'd be amazing if we could
catch that scumbag with this,

709
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:56,102
but it's also true it's more important
to prevent more murders.

710
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,186
You're right.

711
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,815
I already let him hit me in the head
as if I were his punching bag.

712
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,526
I don't care if I'm on the chopping block.

713
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,905
-Let's go.
-Okay, let's go.

714
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:28,551
I came to the right place.

715
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,858
Aren't you from
Gangnam Police Station? Wait.

716
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,109
Was it Jongno Station?

717
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,404
You are a detective, right?
Oh, you must be from Seoul HQ.

718
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:50,781
Hello, I'm Reporter Choi Yoon-ji
from Fact Today.

719
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,116
I have your business card.

720
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,202
I knew it. We've met before, right?

721
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,037
<i>Yes, Director.</i>

722
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,539
I'm finally getting an exclusive report.

723
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,124
You're interfering
with official police duty.

724
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,959
-What the heck?
-Stop her.

725
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,461
There's no exclusive here.

726
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:04,920
What nonsense are you saying?

727
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,506
Let me…

728
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,468
You're the cop who took my phone
in front of the motel.

729
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,262
You are that cop, right? My gosh.

730
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:14,263
Goodness.

731
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:16,849
Detective, could you spare me a moment?

732
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,809
I have many questions about this case.

733
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,563
The main road is over there.

734
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,524
And this is
the only security footage of him.

735
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:27,693
I just think it's odd.

736
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:30,196
You put out an APB on a faceless suspect.

737
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,655
I don't get it.

738
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:35,534
I can't tell you anything
as we're still investigating the case.

739
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,536
Wait, Detective!

740
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,539
Can you at least tell me your name
if I can't have your number?

741
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,919
He's leaving like that? What a petty jerk.

742
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,262
That car…

743
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:59,433
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

744
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,655
SERIAL MURDER GAME?
WARNING TO SOCIETY OR TO POLICE?

745
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,658
Kim Bong-sik, this jerk!

746
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,673
-That's it.
-Nice shot.

747
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:36,470
MURDER SUSPECT WANTED
REWARD 50 MILLION WON

748
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,395
Darn it, this punk…

749
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:03,747
FACELESS SERIAL MURDER SUSPECT

750
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:15,843
What's the map for?

751
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,553
I want to carry it around with me

752
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,263
when I visit the scenes
for profiling purposes.

753
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:22,600
If I mark all the major
bus and subway routes

754
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:25,603
and note the time of each incident
and even the weather that day,

755
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,396
it'll be helpful.

756
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:28,897
Then I'll help you.

757
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,441
Thank you.

758
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:31,900
Hey, that's a lot of work.

759
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:33,611
I'm stating the obvious,

760
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,779
but the answers are always
found at the scene.

761
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:39,658
Shall I make you one too?

762
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,327
No, it's okay. We'll share it.

763
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:45,080
13 DAYS SINCE THE OPEN SEARCH BEGAN

764
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,833
NOVEMBER 13, 2003

765
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,449
GUNGOK-DONG, HWANGHWA-DONG

766
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,534
From here…

767
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,789
It means he frequents this area
via public transportation.

768
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:36,632
<i>All four cases</i>

769
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:39,259
<i>happened between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.</i>

770
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:43,764
<i>A timeframe when it's likely to find
only women or the elderly at home.</i>

771
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,140
MEDICAL BOOKS

772
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,320
Are you looking for a particular book?

773
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:43,240
I'm looking for a book on anatomy.

774
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:44,450
I see. This way, please.

775
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,372
You can find them here.

776
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,417
If you have a particular title
you're looking for,

777
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,960
I can look it up for you.

778
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:01,467
<i>HUMAN ANATOMY</i>

779
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,302
<i>HUMAN ANATOMY
ANATOMY</i>

780
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,833
It's already been over a month
since you put out an APB.

781
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,877
You still don't have anything for us?

782
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,504
At least tell us your lead.

783
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:42,841
Well, thankfully there hasn't been
another victim yet.

784
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:45,552
We are doing everything we can.

785
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,471
You have to give us something

786
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:48,847
so we can write an article.

787
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,349
Even after you put out the APB…

788
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:52,976
-At least share the information!
-Tell us anything.

789
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,020
Come on! Give me something to write about!

790
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:56,563
-Give us information.
-Tell us!

791
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,774
Why won't you tell us?

792
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:01,026
Please raise your hand
and speak one at a time.

793
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:02,653
{\an8}PROFILING REPORT

794
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:18,502
I don't think now is
the right time to hand this over.

795
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:22,589
I know that too.

796
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,842
I just think they really need a lead.

797
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:28,136
I feel like there is a need

798
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,974
to examine and analyze
the culprit's behavior

799
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,268
as much as we can. Now more than ever.

800
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:40,315
It says here…

801
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:43,819
"Effort in trying to steal valuables
is very low."

802
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:45,028
What does this mean?

803
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:47,614
In the case of Hwanghwa-dong, there was
an attempt to try to open the safe.

804
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,408
If stealing the valuables was his purpose,

805
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:52,828
it only makes sense to kill the victim
after he's made them open the safe.

806
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:54,162
But he did the opposite.

807
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,958
Above that, it says,
"Character disorder severe enough

808
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:01,587
to commit a crime. Highly likely
he had issues with family members."

809
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:05,424
Even if we can get his medical history,
how can we know if he has issues at home?

810
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:07,217
For a person with this much rage,

811
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:10,012
I'm sure that it showed
in his daily life too.

812
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:12,389
We can't take a survey
of every household though.

813
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:13,849
It's not like we can ask

814
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:16,393
if they have a family member
who has a lot of anger.

815
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:20,147
By the way, where is Chief Kim Bong-sik?

816
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,024
He said he was going to the sauna.

817
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,317
My goodness.

818
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,527
Just how much dirt
does he need to wash off?

819
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:28,113
But here, it says, "The culprit's crimes,

820
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:31,033
planning, and choice of location and time
are too systematic.

821
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:34,995
It's unlikely that he has an intellectual
disability or schizophrenia.

822
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:39,041
Therefore, there is a need
to focus the investigation on people

823
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:41,293
who have an aggressive
character disorder."

824
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:43,712
I'm having trouble
understanding this part.

825
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:46,632
What's the reason we have to differentiate

826
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:49,718
schizophrenia, intellectual disabilities,
and character disorders?

827
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:52,721
Character disorder is an illness
when one shows extreme

828
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:55,515
or deformed forms of obsessive
dependent, avoidant,

829
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,017
or antisocial characteristics.

830
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:59,645
But everyone makes little of this illness

831
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,563
so they don't take
active measures to treat it.

832
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:03,899
So there may not be
medical records of it then.

833
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:05,567
Yes, that's right.

834
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:07,235
Even if he did get treatment,

835
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:09,321
it probably didn't last long.

836
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:11,531
The possibility of having been
admitted to a closed ward

837
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:13,784
is extremely low too.

838
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,746
Meaning character disorders
don't leave many clues.

839
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:23,710
Are you sure it's not someone with
an intellectual disorder or schizophrenia?

840
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,754
All right.

841
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:27,631
Let me explain this to you easily.

842
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:30,926
Patients with schizophrenia,
intellectual disorder, or delusion.

843
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:34,346
It's hard for them
to commit premeditated crimes.

844
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:36,973
You saw the crime scene of this case.

845
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:39,017
It's clean and there's no witness.

846
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:41,812
You're right.
Cho Hyun Gil wasn't mentally ill either.

847
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:43,897
What we're trying to tell you is

848
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,234
instead of mental patients who
have been receiving continuous treatment,

849
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:49,194
although the chances are low,

850
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:53,990
we should look for a suspect
who has a record.

851
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,325
That's what we mean.

852
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:58,495
That means it will be harder
to narrow down a suspect.

853
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:01,456
I thought you said you'd make it easier.
I'm more confused now.

854
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,999
That's too broad.

855
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,710
We don't have enough people as is.

856
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:06,128
Based on what you're saying,

857
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:08,630
every single citizen is a suspect then.

858
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:11,258
To be blunt, who doesn't have a temper?

859
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:14,511
Besides our benevolent
Superintendent Baek.

860
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:17,180
So these are more or less just guesswork.

861
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,099
Right?

862
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:23,061
It's not like you gave us a specific lead
that we can investigate on.

863
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:26,857
We can't mobilize the entire squad
just based on this.

864
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,072
<i>It's been over three months</i>

865
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:37,075
<i>and the police still don't have
a single lead on the culprit.</i>

866
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,661
He's a murderer who killed seven people.

867
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:43,165
You're talking as if
the police are incompetent.

868
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:45,459
But they are doing their very best.

869
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:48,420
<i>That goes for the Hwanghwa-dong case
from October too.</i>

870
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:51,506
<i>They found an image of the culprit
from CCTV footage.</i>

871
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:55,510
<i>Also, they are actively receiving tip-offs</i>

872
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:58,555
<i>so they will find a lead
on the culprit soon.</i>

873
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:02,058
<i>It's already been over two months
since they released an APB.</i>

874
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,396
<i>If they were relying on the APB for a lead
they should've gotten one a long time ago.</i>

875
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,690
<i>Time is passing,
including this moment here.</i>

876
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,692
<i>People are growing
more anxious by the day.</i>

877
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:13,111
<i>What do they plan on doing about this?</i>

878
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:15,030
<i>To strengthen public security</i>

879
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:18,366
<i>on top of increasing
the number of patrolling officers,</i>

880
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,827
<i>they have offered many solutions
like installing security cameras</i>

881
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,829
<i>in crime-ridden districts.</i>

882
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,539
<i>They are currently executing
those solutions.</i>

-It's already been months!
-What is this?

888
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:26,560
He's a murderer.
They only got a picture of his back.

889
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,520
How do they plan to catch him with this?

890
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:30,105
-Seriously.
-That's what I mean!

891
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:32,566
-How can they catch him?
-Seriously.

892
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:38,780
Gosh, he's an evil one, isn't he?

893
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,156
-Yes.
-You're right.

894
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,950
Why can't they catch him?

895
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:43,535
-What are the police doing?
-Exactly.

896
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,787
They still haven't been able
to catch a punk like this.

897
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:48,498
-I know right?
-Yes.

898
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:56,756
<i>Next up.</i>

899
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,426
<i>It's been over three months

00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:01,970
<i>an APB with a picture
of the suspect's back.</i>

901
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:04,598
<i>This serial murder case
of rich, elderly citizens</i>

902
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,224
<i>shocked the nation last October.</i>

903
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,643
<i>They still haven't been able
to catch the suspect yet.</i>

904
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,896
Inspector Song or whatever
is nowhere to be found.

905
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:12,647
I can't find anything.

906
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:14,816
<i>It's been reported to us.</i>

907
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,611
<i>Simultaneously, the police
continue to look for the suspect…</i>

908
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:18,987
I don't even know anymore.

909
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:21,239
<i>They stated…</i>

910
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:27,871
-I'll write one up quickly.
-No, it's fine.

911
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:36,922
Captain.

912
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,089
Take a look at this.

913
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:48,308
<i>The decision for an open search.</i>

914
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:51,436
<i>Is this the police's lifeline
or is this the beginning of doom?</i>

<i>FACT TODAY</i>, REPORTER CHOI YOON-JI

00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:55,899
<i>If the culprit does not stop</i>

917
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:58,068
<i>and continues to commit
the crimes in hiding,</i>

918
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:01,905
<i>it might turn into a bad move

919
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:03,490
<i>in finding leads to the culprit.</i>

920
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:07,202
<i>The murders broke out four times,
not just once.</i>

921
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:08,495
<i>How can they not catch the culprit?</i>

922
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:09,871
<i>The pathetic reality of the police.</i>

923
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:12,207
<i>-Just as I expected of the police.
-When will they catch the culprit?</i>

924
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:13,208
<i>I'm too scared.</i>

925
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:15,710
<i>The culprit will definitely
kill someone again.</i>

926
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:17,629
<i>It was too rash to start an open search.</i>

927
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:19,673
<i>The culprit would only hide more.</i>

928
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,925
<i>I'd trust my dog
before I trust the police.</i>

929
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:26,096
You wanted to make
the Behavioral Analysis Team,

930
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:28,723
so I let you have your way,
but what have you done right?

931
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,227
You began an open search
just by using a photo of his back,

932
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:33,853
but you have no evidence?

933
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,231
This only made the police look ridiculous!

934
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:38,858
How will you patch this up?

935
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,360
Commissioner.

936
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:43,530
Our detectives are out there
running around and doing their best.

937
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:44,990
And so is the Behavioral Analysis Team.

938
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:46,366
I don't want your best!

939
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:48,702
Bring me the result!

940
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:52,831
Bring that jerk
who killed seven people immediately!

941
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:55,125
Put him before those wordy reporters!

942
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,460
When you were out on the field,

943
00:54:57,544 --> 00:55:00,255
you taught us a few ways,
and we tried everything.

944
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:03,425
We asked around the crime scene,

945
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:05,552
we talked to every deliveryman
around the area.

946
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,929
We searched
every Internet cafe user in the area.

947
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:09,723
We even got a warrant
to search the base station,

948
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:12,517
and searched every person
who used their phones in the area.

949
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:16,021
But we still haven't found
a strand of the culprit's hair.

950
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:20,608
The Behavioral Analysis Team
or whoever, we need to ask

951
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:23,069
and find a new method

952
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,904
of investigating this case.

953
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:28,783
Yes, so just as the Analysis Team
reported on the profiling report,

954
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,869
we plan on searching for people
with mental illnesses

955
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:33,204
who have sought help
along with the investigation.

956
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:34,205
Darn it.

957
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:38,168
You didn't know
that I've been getting reports

958
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:41,379
that the Analysis Team
is out on the field, did you?

959
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:45,925
-Sorry?
-They keep asking me

960
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:48,678
who those guys are
and complaining about them.

961
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:51,014
I can only turn a blind eye
to those complaints for so long.

962
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:54,601
We can't force them to stop
when they want to take part

963
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,519
in the investigation.

964
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:58,063
Enough.

965
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:02,650
I don't want to hear your excuses anymore.

966
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:06,613
Make sure you take firm measures.

967
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,868
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

968
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,334
What is it you want to say?

969
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:22,670
What is it?

970
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:25,840
Let's put an end to our obsession.

971
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,717
The SCS has too many cases to resolve

972
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:30,345
rather than look for some guy
who can't even be detected.

973
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:34,724
You talk as if we're a huge burden
to the Special Crime Squad.

974
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,142
You never even bother to hear us out.

975
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,311
Young-soo, that's not what happened.

976
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:41,189
We began an open search for him
just with a photo of his back.

977
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:43,691
The commissioner taught me
a big lesson when I went in

978
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,318
to have some documents approved.

979
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:48,613
-So you called us to nitpick over that?
-Nitpick? I'm your superior.

980
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:50,240
Why would I do that with you two?

981
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,950
If anything, I'd give you an order.

982
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:55,161
All I'm saying is that
we've all done enough.

983
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:58,581
What do you mean by enough?
Are you telling us to give up?

984
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:01,084
Hey, there is no giving up
when it comes to our cases.

985
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:05,421
I'm saying there are many cases
we could solve with that time.

986
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:06,673
Come on.

987
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:09,467
We never just sat on our hands.

988
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:12,512
The Behavioral Analysis Team
has done our duty by ourselves.

989
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:16,349
What is it?
Stop beating around the bush and tell me.

990
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:17,559
Goodness.

991
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:19,769
I'll be frank.

992
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:23,148
Those up above aren't happy

993
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,025
with the Behavioral Analysis Team.

994
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,278
They were never happy with us. Good grief.

995
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:31,281
We're a workplace. An organization.
What can we do?

996
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:33,199
Those men out there also are complaining

997
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:36,286
about how your team is coming
in and out of the crime scenes.

998
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,997
The only thing we can do
is investigate the crime scene.

999
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:41,749
-If you stop us from doing that…
-I mean,

1000
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:44,252
I just want to stop by the crime scene
after the forensics are done.

1001
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:45,420
What's the problem?

1002
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:48,089
There are many other things
you can work on.

1003
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:51,342
You know, those documents
you took from the cabinets.

1004
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:54,512
You all study that and create data too.

1005
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:57,849
That's our job, so we'll manage, okay?

1006
00:57:57,932 --> 00:58:00,018
Please don't stop us
from going to the crime scenes.

1007
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:03,271
There's nothing he can do to stop us.
We can go whenever we want to.

1008
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:07,484
Forget it. I'm done with this. Goodbye.

1009
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:09,903
We need to put an end to this.
Inspector Song.

1010
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:13,323
I know you visit
the crime scene every day.

1011
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:16,117
I'm not trying to stop you.

1012
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:19,454
Please use your effort
on something else too.

1013
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:22,499
Let's go.

1014
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,751
I'm talking to him right now.

1015
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,587
It's my first time
having a serious talk with him.

1016
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:30,423
You don't have to listen.
There's nothing serious about it.

1017
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:31,382
Come on out.

1018
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:33,092
That little…

1019
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:36,971
Please excuse me.

1020
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:40,934
You understand what I mean, right?

1021
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:50,026
-What now?
-What do you mean?

1022
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:52,278
I would've never started
if I was going to stop.

1023
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:55,657
Do you know something we have in common?

1024
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:58,368
-Nothing.
-Exactly.

1025
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:00,119
Who do they think we are?

1026
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,288
Let's not lose our spirit.
We have lots to do.

1027
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:08,127
Mr. Gu Young-chun, please come on in.

1028
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,843
X-RAY ROOM

1029
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,766
Sir, we're about to take
an X-ray of your entire body.

1030
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,996
64 DAYS SINCE THE OPEN SEARCH BEGAN

1031
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,790
JANUARY 3, 2004

1032
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,714
<i>Did he give up on committing
another crime to hide?</i>

1033
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:54,382
<i>Or…</i>

1034
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:58,511
<i>is he still planning another crime?</i>

1035
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,227
You never miss a day.

1036
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:13,151
We never know
when the crimes will start again.

1037
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:14,777
Don't believe…

1038
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,656
that you decided to begin
the open search all by yourself.

1039
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:23,745
The Special Crime Squad isn't incompetent

1040
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:26,289
to the point we'd blindly follow

1041
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:27,832
a rash decision.

1042
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:31,586
From the outside,

1043
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:35,298
it may seem like
the investigation is standing still.

1044
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:39,093
Until the moment we catch the culprit,

1045
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:41,429
even we sometimes feel that way.

1046
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,098
However,

1047
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,894
we came to this choice altogether.

1048
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,857
What doesn't change is
how we came to the same decision.

1049
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,777
That all we want is to catch the culprit.

1050
01:00:57,987 --> 01:01:00,448
What's more important
than wanting to catch the culprit

1051
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:04,077
is actually catching the culprit.

1052
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,917
We will catch him. Certainly.

1053
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:14,754
He will not stop.

1054
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:16,881
We'll catch him before he goes on.

1055
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:23,012
I thought it would work
once we stopped him.

1056
01:01:25,723 --> 01:01:27,809
I look through the daily reports
every morning,

1057
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:30,436
and I don't see a report of a crime
in that same pattern.

1058
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:36,442
What if…

1059
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:39,904
What if the culprit changed the MO?

1060
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:44,283
What do we do then?

1061
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:45,303
DAILY CASE REPORT

1062
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:02,653
JANUARY 30, 2004
VICTIM: KIM YANG-HEE

1063
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:06,073
THE VICTIM WAS STABBED
WITH A CAMPING KNIFE

1064
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:46,531
-Go home.
-See you later.

1065
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:47,782
-Call me.
-Text me.

1066
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:49,700
-Hurry. It's getting cold.
-Okay, bye.

1067
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:52,537
-Call me.
-Okay, bye.

1068
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,247
FEBRUARY 12, 2004

1069
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:55,498
SINHEUNG 2-DONG, YEONGDEUNGPO-GU

1070
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,000
<i>Are you home?</i>

1071
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:00,211
<i>I'm almost home.</i>

1072
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:02,046
TO SU-MIN

1073
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:29,133
<i>The devil has yet again disappeared
without a trace.</i>

1074
01:05:29,216 --> 01:05:30,343
<i>Time is ticking.</i>

1075
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:31,802
<i>If this becomes a cold case…</i>

1076
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:35,056
Most murderers like him usually kill
for their own pleasure and enjoyment.

1077
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:37,099
<i>It means killing makes them happy.</i>

1078
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:39,435
<i>-Camping knife?
-Do you think it's the same guy?</i>

1079
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:40,895
It's similar to the guy we're looking for.

1080
01:05:40,978 --> 01:05:43,022
<i>The murder weapon, MO, and time
don't match at all.</i>

1081
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:44,815
<i>What if it's what we speculated?</i>

1082
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:46,359
What if he failed to finish the job?

1083
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:49,737
Then we have two serial killers
in this country.
