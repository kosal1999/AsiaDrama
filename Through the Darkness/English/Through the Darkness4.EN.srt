1
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:20,955
<i>The crime site and his residence
may be within walking distance</i>

2
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,583
<i>between the point she went missing
and the victim's home.</i>

3
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,017
I think I found the place.

4
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,520
Wait for me.

5
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:43,788
Cho Hyun-gil!

6
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,059
<i>If you search his house,
it will be neatly organized.</i>

7
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,730
<i>The weapon he used
will also have been put away neatly.</i>

8
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,991
That's not a shelf.
It's the interior floor of the fridge.

9
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,696
Captain Yoon. What…

10
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,783
Captain Yoon.

11
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,697
It's caked with dust.
I doubt he'll come back.

12
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,074
A man who lives alone doesn't clean.

13
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:45,034
But seeing how organized and neat he was,

14
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,161
he probably spends
a lot of time cleaning too.

15
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,998
Seeing how dusty it is
like Captain Kook said,

16
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,833
he didn't come here for a long time.

17
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:52,959
But…

18
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,004
we'll still wait for him.

19
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,547
I'll wait too.

20
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,090
You don't have to.

21
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,384
-Detective Nam and I can handle it.
-Yes.

22
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,263
Then I'll get going first.

23
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:08,141
Goodnight. I'll see you around.

24
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,225
Bye.

25
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,394
You should go too.

26
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,479
I don't want there
to be a pile of cars here.

27
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,148
I'll park my car somewhere else.

28
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,442
What?

29
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,862
He never listens to others.

30
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,572
He doesn't.

31
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,699
Good luck.

32
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,328
If anything happens,
give me a call right away.

33
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,971
Get some sleep if you're tired.

34
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,390
No. I'm fine.

35
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,976
If you're tired, you can get some sleep.

36
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,606
No. I'm good too.

37
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:05,990
Should I get out?

38
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,617
Wait.

39
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:17,919
Darn it.

40
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,047
That scared the wits out of me.

41
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,211
Do you carry around cat food?

42
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,338
Yes. Sometimes.

43
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,340
It's not cat food. It's just some snacks.

44
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,719
What are you eating?

45
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,680
Chocolate.

46
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,265
I see.

47
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,063
I'm good.

48
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,610
I didn't peg you

49
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,572
to be an animal lover.

50
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,241
Animals can't talk,

51
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:32,952
so they can't lie.

52
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,414
Even when they're hungry

53
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,333
or sick, they can't tell us.

54
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,336
So I just thought

55
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,506
it'd be nice

56
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,886
if someone recognized it first.

57
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,262
What are you doing here
so early in the morning?

58
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:34,722
Oh, hello.

59
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:40,228
We're just waiting for someone.

60
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,481
Are you waiting for Cho?

61
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,653
Well, yes.

62
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,405
Do you know Mr. Cho Hyun-gil?

63
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,742
I'm his landlady.

64
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:58,829
Do you happen to know when he'll be back?

65
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:02,041
I actually came here to check
because I couldn't reach him.

66
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,001
He's behind on rent,

67
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,462
but I can't get hold of him.

68
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,713
Well, anyway…

69
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:11,717
Why are you looking for him
so early in the morning?

70
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,845
We're from the police.

71
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,767
SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS

72
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,700
-You're here.
-Hey.

73
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:39,579
The description of the little girl
the landlady saw

74
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,955
matches that of Soo-hyun.

75
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,040
-Did you check the vehicle too?
-Yes.

76
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,084
Now, we just need to find Cho Hyun-gil.

77
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,460
Sir, you're here.

78
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:50,923
Hey, what are you doing here? Darn it.

79
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,843
Hey, the Behavioral Analysis Team
can't be here.

80
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,553
-Why not?
-You know the answer.

81
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,805
You're supposed
to investigate under the table.

82
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,348
If the higher-ups find out,
they'll go nuts.

83
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,933
And the media shouldn't know.

84
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,977
This is so unfair.

85
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,978
Why is it unfair?

86
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:07,440
Don't you know the commissioner is
more afraid of reporters than his wife?

87
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,233
What? You're here too?

88
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,861
I'm sure Soo-hyun's fingers
are around his house.

89
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,280
We must find them.

90
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,616
First, you'll have to help us
search the scene.

91
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,367
Gosh.

92
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,829
Check that spot over there.

93
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,372
This spot here?

94
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,459
Careful. Be careful not to touch that.

95
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,794
Check that spot in the back too.

96
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:29,795
Anything?

97
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,090
Did you find anything? Look over there.

98
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,262
Over here!

99
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,600
What is it?

100
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,731
It's decomposed,
but it is a child's finger.

101
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:54,737
Let's keep searching.

102
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,630
There are only eight.

103
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,341
Let's keep looking.

104
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,260
I'm sure we'll find the rest.

105
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,637
They may have drifted away.

106
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,181
Let's search together

107
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,974
all the way to the nearest sewer.

108
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,309
Let's keep on looking.

109
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,269
We'll search together.

110
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,740
We're missing two fingers of a girl!

111
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,326
Look through the grass
and check under the rocks.

112
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,370
Please search thoroughly!

113
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,663
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

114
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:02,638
Young-soo.

115
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,015
Yes.

116
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,810
We searched thoroughly all the way there
but found nothing.

117
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,313
This is the last spot we can search.

118
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,358
-They must've rotted away by now.
-The body was

119
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,403
stored in the freezer before
it was discarded at different times.

120
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,447
The decomposition has
probably been delayed.

121
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,116
We must find at least the bones.

122
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,702
We still have hope,
so let's keep on looking.

123
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,287
Let's search some more.

124
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,081
Yes, sir.

125
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:35,880
Captain.

126
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,715
Did you find something?

127
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,974
Darn it. It's a sausage.

128
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,490
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

129
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,909
We checked the area
around Cho Hyun-gil's home

130
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,161
immediately after the incident broke out.

131
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,121
Right.

132
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,415
It didn't look like anyone lived there,

133
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,752
so it was overlooked.

134
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:59,880
No, it's totally understandable.

135
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,216
I couldn't even figure out
where the entrance was.

136
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,842
I couldn't even find the door.

137
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,303
Why is it so hot in here?
Am I the only one sweating?

138
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,848
Here, use this as a fan.

139
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,852
-Thanks.
-Soo-hyun's fingers…

140
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,729
We'll find them.

141
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,193
We already found eight of them.
They were thrown out,

142
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,153
so we'll find the rest.

143
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,781
Yes, we must find them.

144
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,283
Right.

145
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,492
So how did you know…

146
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,412
that her fingers would be there?

147
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:32,746
It was just…

148
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,125
a gut feeling.

149
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,919
You're as intuitive as Captain Yoon.

150
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,963
Why don't we call it a day?

151
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,339
Yes, let's do that.

152
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,507
You can all get going.

153
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,676
I'll leave in a bit.

154
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,052
It was a long day.

155
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,637
Tomorrow will be another hard day.
Get some rest.

156
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,806
I'm okay. You should all get going.

157
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,932
-All right.
-Bye.

158
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,809
-Bye.
-Bye.

159
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,812
Then I'll get going too.

160
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,230
Okay, good work today.

161
00:14:58,856 --> 00:14:59,815
Take it easy.

162
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,074
Ha-young.

163
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,161
If you insist on staying all by yourself,

164
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,624
everyone else will feel like
they're not working hard enough.

165
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,127
My apologies. That wasn't my intention.

166
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,587
Don't overwork yourself.

167
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,505
-I won't. Have a good night.
-You too.

168
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,883
-Take it easy.
-Bye.

169
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,814
My gosh. I'm sorry, honey.

170
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,233
I woke you up, didn't I?

171
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,526
Are the kids asleep?

172
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,196
I see.

173
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,781
All right.

174
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:52,451
By the way, tell Joo-hyun and Soo-hyun…

175
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,333
that I want to hear their voices.

176
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,169
Have them call me when they wake up.

177
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,882
Oh, boy. I'm being selfish again.

178
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,425
I woke you up.

179
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,345
I'm sorry.

180
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,889
Go back to sleep, Mi-yeon.

181
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,310
Okay.

182
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,851
<i>Kidnapped on May 20.</i>

183
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,521
<i>Body parts were found
for the first time on May 29.</i>

184
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:05,607
<i>The torso and the head
were also found on May 30.</i>

185
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:09,028
<i>On June 25, additional body parts
were found in a toilet at a motel</i>

186
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,280
<i>after the culprit spent a night there.</i>

187
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,617
<i>Cho Hyun-gil disposed of the body parts
at different times and locations.</i>

188
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,329
<i>Where are the two fingers…</i>

189
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,165
<i>that haven't turned up yet?</i>

190
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,169
<i>Where could Cho Hyun-gil be hiding?</i>

191
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,422
<i>Where could Cho Hyun-gil be hiding?</i>

192
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,852
44 DAYS AFTER THE INCIDENT

193
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,646
JULY 12, 2000

194
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,356
FORENSICS SQUAD

195
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:48,984
-You're here.
-Good work.

196
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,069
Where's In-tak?

197
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,612
He went to take a nap.

198
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,405
May I see the analysis result?

199
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,615
Yes, one second.

200
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:56,784
Right here.

201
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,707
-Hey.
-You're here.

202
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,793
I guess you had a rough night.

203
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,961
I lied down to take a nap,

204
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:11,715
but I kept having dreams of looking
for the kid's fingers, so I just got up.

205
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,342
You're doing good work.

206
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,178
We checked the fingerprints
we got yesterday from that house,

207
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,514
and they're mostly of Cho Hyun-gil
or the victim.

208
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,350
Have you heard about the DNA too?

209
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,602
Yes, the NFS called.

210
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,396
I don't see his middle
and ring fingers here either.

211
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,066
There were only three fingerprints
on the weapon too.

212
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,401
The ones we found
at his place are all partial.

213
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,779
All we have are only five fingers.

214
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:36,156
For now, we know
that it was done by Cho Hyun-gil.

215
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,867
We just have to find out
where he's hiding.

216
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,744
We found out who he is,
so he'll be caught soon.

217
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,704
-Anyway, keep it up.
-Okay.

218
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,915
-Let me know if you find anything.
-All right.

219
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,291
-Take care.
-Goodbye.

220
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:51,171
Cho Hyun-gil. Age 40.

221
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:55,050
He lived in 39-1 Changeui-dong.

222
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,470
He has a history of molesting
a four-year-old girl in Songju-dong

223
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,305
in September of 1997.

224
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:04,143
So how did he get omitted from the list?

225
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,104
After he moved,
he did not register his new address.

226
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,064
That's why he was left out.

227
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,692
I went to his house,

228
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:14,153
and it could hardly be called a home

229
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,154
where one lives.

230
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,698
His house was on the outskirts,

231
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,658
so we missed it when we went around.

232
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,742
I'm sorry.

233
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,578
We missed him when he was right there.

234
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,330
Hey, wait.

235
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,500
If he was previously convicted in 1997,

236
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,544
it hasn't been that long.

237
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:33,505
He was sentenced
to two years and six months.

238
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,424
He was released this March.

239
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,802
Goodness, that means
it has only been four months.

240
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,597
The ink on the paperwork
probably hasn't even dried, that jerk.

241
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,559
Anyway, the DNA of the missing kid
was found in his house, right?

242
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:48,020
The NFS just called.

243
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:51,231
We also confirmed his fingerprints
that were on the weapon.

244
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,858
Make sure you find

245
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,943
where this Cho Hyun-gil is.

246
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,779
If he did this only two months
after his release,

247
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,698
we don't know what he'll do next.

248
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,825
Captain Yoon, let's hurry.

249
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,828
The entire team went out to search
around the Changeui-dong area.

250
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:09,625
<i>I sent Detective Nam out
to the butcher shop Cho worked at.</i>

251
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,711
He must've worked here
while Moon-soo was here.

252
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,255
-Moon-soo?
-He's my nephew.

253
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,633
I had some business to take care of,

254
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,219
so my nephew was looking after my shop.

255
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,261
Oh, I see.

256
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:25,724
That man suddenly quit
even before a month was up.

257
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,977
Most people won't pay the man
after leaving like that.

258
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,271
I'm a good man,
so I paid him what he deserves.

259
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,148
Do you have anything to show
that you paid him?

260
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,025
You know, on your bank account history.

261
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:39,780
People who take up jobs like this
do it for the cash.

262
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,823
You paid him fully in cash?

263
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,826
Right, I gave him some checks too.

264
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:49,581
Yes, do you remember which bank it was?

265
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,708
Was it Johong Bank?

266
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,961
<i>May I see the transaction history
of this check?</i>

267
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,547
I guess we did the search
when his nephew was at the shop.

268
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:58,799
That's why we missed him.

269
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,178
I'll send you the address
of where the check was used.

270
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,729
-There are three fingerprints?
-Yes.

271
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,357
When you grab a knife or a saw,

272
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,693
your fingerprints are left
at a certain location.

273
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,403
Like this.

274
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:22,572
I'd get it if we didn't find
any fingerprints at all.

275
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:26,076
You'll see even partial prints
from the middle and ring fingers.

276
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,079
Right thumb, right index, and right pinky.

277
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,789
It's strange that
those were the only prints.

278
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,042
It's either one of the two.

279
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,963
He either has an odd grip…

280
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:42,926
or is missing fingers.

281
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,063
I'm going to make you fly.

282
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,690
Here we go.

283
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:57,983
Just push me.

284
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,486
Don't do it so hard.

285
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,210
By any chance, have you seen this man?

286
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,552
Hey, have you seen this customer?

287
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,056
Could you please try to remember?

288
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:33,185
He used a check here on June 26.

289
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:36,688
I'm not sure about the date,
but I remember getting a check.

290
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,315
I'd never received one before.

291
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:40,233
But…

292
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:43,111
I don't remember what he looked like.

293
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:46,823
Do you have CCTV?

294
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,454
<i>He's only missing
his right middle and ring fingers.</i>

295
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:56,333
<i>No matter how meticulously
you plan something,</i>

296
00:22:56,416 --> 00:23:00,462
your habits come out like second nature.

297
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,006
I'm sure there was a reason
behind stripping her.

298
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,425
He had to strip her to get off.

299
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:09,387
And whoever did that is the real culprit.

300
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,274
-Gil-pyo.
-Hey.

301
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,359
The culprit.

302
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,945
He's probably missing two fingers, okay?

303
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,988
Will you please stay quiet?

304
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,825
<i>The visitors who come to Seoul are over…</i>

305
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,037
How long will you treat us like a shadow?

306
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,081
I didn't treat you like a shadow… What?

307
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:40,168
You're banning a solid team
from doing any work. What else is it then?

308
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,089
What is it? Be honest.
Something is going on, right?

309
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,799
No, nothing is going on.

310
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:46,842
Look at this.

311
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:49,511
I can always tell when you're lying.

312
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,637
I know you.

313
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,057
You can't fool me.

314
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,400
Wait, one second.

315
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,653
Okay.

316
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,116
-Stay here. I'll go.
-Okay.

317
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:14,828
Hello.

318
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,455
SOJU

319
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,040
A pack of cigarettes, please.

320
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:23,628
That will be 3,200 won.

321
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:28,592
Wait.

322
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:30,677
Is that him?

323
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,896
Your change is 1,800 won.

324
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,165
Thank you. Goodbye.

325
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:06,087
What? The guy who just went out.

326
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:10,800
Just now?

327
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,637
Yes, he looks like the man who just left.

328
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,888
His clothes.

329
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,264
Is that him?

330
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:30,695
Mr. Cho Hyun-gil?

331
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,368
Darn it.

332
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,003
Cho Hyun-gil!

333
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,606
Darn it.

334
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:08,233
Cho Hyun-gil!

335
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,414
Darn it.

336
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:23,915
Captain Yoon.

337
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:30,839
Cho Hyun-gil.

338
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,633
You're under emergency arrest
for Lee Soo-hyun's murder.

339
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:36,970
You have the right to consult an attorney
and to remain silent.

340
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,263
Do you have anything to say?

341
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,056
Darn it!

342
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,521
-Are you okay, Il-young?
-Yes.

343
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:53,069
Chief Heo, we caught him.

344
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,325
We caught him!

345
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,785
-Cho Hyun-gil?
-Yes.

346
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:01,995
What about his fingers?

347
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:10,462
So you drank through the night on May 19,

348
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:13,006
then abducted Lee Soo-hyun

349
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,674
around 3 p.m. the next day.

350
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,218
Is that correct?

351
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,057
Why was it Soo-hyun,
a girl who was only five years old?

352
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:24,642
I just…

353
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,273
<i>saw that girl there.</i>

354
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,234
Are you saying it wasn't planned?

355
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,575
Did you kidnap Lee Soo-hyun,

356
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,661
so you could rape her?

357
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,539
-No.
-No?

358
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:50,877
Cho Hyun-gil.

359
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,630
You served time for molesting
and assaulting a minor.

360
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,924
And you were discharged in March.

361
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,927
It had only been two months.

362
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:00,595
Right?

363
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,140
Gosh, it hurts.

364
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,476
Does it hurt?

365
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,145
You think that hurts?

366
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:14,651
Soo-hyun was

367
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,237
only five years old.

368
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:22,033
-I was going to ask for money.
-What money?

369
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:25,453
-I was going to ask for two million won.
-What?

370
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:27,872
I wanted a ransom.

371
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:32,252
Two million won?

372
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,089
Let us interview him too.

373
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,591
Keep it down.

374
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,928
Hey, I'll let you interview him

375
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:44,139
before he gets transferred
to the prosecution.

376
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,515
You just wait for now.

377
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:48,518
-You're just going to transfer him, right?
-No.

378
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,228
Yes, you will. Come on.

379
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,439
We must find out

380
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,108
where the other two fingers are.

381
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:04,617
I was just going to ask for money
at first. I'm telling the truth.

382
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:05,785
But what?

383
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,878
-Mom.
-Hey.

384
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,005
-Mom!
-Don't cry. Why are you crying?

385
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,089
Mom.

386
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,676
Mom!

387
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,636
Mom.

388
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,514
-Darn it.
-Mom.

389
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,560
Good work, Captain Yoon.

390
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,771
Let's go.

391
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,493
<i>Cho Hyun-gil kidnapped
a five-year-old girl, Lee Soo-hyun.</i>

392
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:47,994
Hey, kid.

393
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:52,040
Do you want me to buy you ice cream?

394
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:53,583
This one.

395
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,176
<i>He was going to demand
a ransom of two million won.</i>

396
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,805
<i>But Lee Soo-hyun got scared</i>

397
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,808
<i>and couldn't remember
her parents' phone number.</i>

398
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,102
<i>He forced her to drink water
spiked with sleeping pills.</i>

399
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,982
<i>And the five-year-old girl,
Lee Soo-hyun, was…</i>

400
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:25,365
AND THE 5-YEAR-OLD GIRL,
LEE SOO HYUN, WAS…

401
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:04,821
Why did you do it?

402
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:10,493
Can I…

403
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,580
smoke a cigarette?

404
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,583
You scumbag.
How dare you ask for a cigarette?

405
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:21,713
No, you can't.

406
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,466
Mr. Cho Hyun-gil.

407
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,511
How do you feel right now?

408
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,723
-I'm sorry.
-To whom?

409
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:38,396
He's asking you to whom
you're apologizing, you jerk!

410
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,647
-Sir.
-You scumbag.

411
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,109
Let go of me. That jerk…

412
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,449
Are you trying to cooperate or what?

413
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:50,742
What?

414
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,452
Don't interrupt us or provoke him.

415
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:53,620
But I'm furious!

416
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,998
How could you not be after looking at him?

417
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,169
You know my second child's name
is Soo-hyun, right?

418
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,838
-And she's six years old.
-Exactly.

419
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:13,389
That's why
you must be infuriated right now.

420
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,894
Don't come in. Stay out here.

421
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,729
-Hey. I…
-I'm asking you.

422
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:21,856
Please.

423
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,401
How did you lose your fingers?

424
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,362
It happened when I was working.

425
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:29,739
Both of them?

426
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,282
Yes.

427
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,543
When did it happen?

428
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,253
I was 30.

429
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,673
It was an accident at a construction site.

430
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,759
-Why didn't you reattach your fingers?
-My fingers flew out.

431
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,637
I searched for hours.

432
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,472
But I was bleeding a lot.

433
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,849
In the end, I couldn't find them.

434
00:32:57,433 --> 00:33:00,520
I was at a construction site,
so I didn't know where they went.

435
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,021
You must have been in pain.

436
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:05,149
-Yes.
-Are you ashamed…

437
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,694
that you're missing fingers?

438
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:12,281
I feel like people
treat me like I'm retarded.

439
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,909
And women don't like that
about you, right?

440
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,468
We already caught the fish.

441
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,595
Will that even help?

442
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,848
We should think about
slicing it or grilling it.

443
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,683
-I'll erase this.
-Leave it.

444
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:42,020
The Behavioral Analysis Team
is still working on it.

445
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,564
"We already caught the fish"?

446
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,358
Are we here to fish?

447
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,443
I mean…

448
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,279
I'll be more careful.

449
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:53,823
By the way,

450
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:56,868
we have to wait until they're done, right?

451
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,746
I'm just curious.

452
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,581
I wonder what they are talking about.

453
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,044
But kids aren't like that.

454
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:07,962
Even if you don't have fingers,

455
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,547
they still approach you
because they are innocent.

456
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,007
Right.

457
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,217
Kids are nice.

458
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,470
Then how could you…

459
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,729
Is that why you got rid of…

460
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:27,315
two of Soo-hyun's fingers too?

461
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,247
<i>On the 12th,</i>

462
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:46,209
<i>the police apprehended the culprit
behind the mutilated girl</i>

463

467

<i>who lived around where the body parts

468
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:59,055
<i>And the police requested an arrest warrant
for murder and abandonment of a corpse.</i>

469
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,433
<i>Severed body parts were found
in Changeui-dong, Bumyeong-dong,</i>

<i>and at a motel in Gyeongseong-dong.</i>

471
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,562
<i>But the police stated that</i>

472
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,898
<i>two of the girl's fingers
could not be found.</i>

473
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:11,609
<i>Cho had already served
two years and six months in prison</i>

474
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:13,778
<i>for sexually assaulting a minor in 1997.</i>

475
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:17,240
<i>The police also confirmed
Cho's past criminal record.</i>

476
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,616
<i>The police will transfer Cho</i>

477
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:21,119

-How could you do that?
-Bring her back!

Even after committing
such a heinous crime,

490
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:58,072
he didn't show any sense of remorse!

491
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,241
How is that possible?

492
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,035
He apologized,

493
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:05,872
but he didn't apologize
to anyone in particular.

494
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:08,791
How is that possible?

495
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,670
-Gosh.
-You should go easy on that.

496
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,255
That little girl

497
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,009

-Her fingers…
-I'll get going first.

499
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,018
Okay. Go.

00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,464
1:06 P.M.

535
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:28,217
<i>Soo-hyun, who do you like more?
Mom or Dad?</i>

536
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,261
<i>I love you both!</i>

537
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:31,262
2:42 P.M.

538
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,389
<i>I love you too, Soo-hyun.</i>

539
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,066
I'm home.

540
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:47,653
Hey, you're getting in late.

541
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,530
Why are you still up?

542
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,241
I couldn't fall asleep.

543
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:56,620
You know, that kid's case.

544
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,164
Wasn't it what you were working on?

545
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,500
-Yes.
-Are you all right?

546
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,253
Yes, of course.

547
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:09,758
Here, have some.

548
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,053
I noticed that you'd run out.

549
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,392
You no longer need to worry about me.
I'm an adult.

550
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,186
I'm not worried.

551
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:22,605
Get some sleep.

552
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,949
This is exactly why I get worried.

553
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,661
When you were little,
you just fell into my arms and cried.

554
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:40,498
ALLEYWAY DINER

555
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:41,707
Gosh, careful.

556
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,794
Hey, I'm really okay.

557
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:48,005
I'm totally sober right now.

558
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:50,549
-Still, I'll take you home.
-No need.

559
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,719
Captain Kook Young-soo is fine.

560
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,304
Hey, Jung Woo-ju.

561
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:59,725
Jung Woo-ju. Jung Chu Chu.

562
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:05,272
Hey, your name is as unusual as mine.

563
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,234
Jung Chu Chu.

564
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,947
-Bye. Don't worry about me.
-But…

565
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:14,990
Get home safely, sir.

566
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,085
<i>What are you up to?
Let's grab a drink together.</i>

567
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,384
<i>I'm not in the mood for a drink.</i>

568
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:34,468
<i>Maybe another time.</i>

569
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,806
Gosh, I'm totally in the mood
for a drink right now,

570
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,349
but I guess Woo-ju isn't.

571
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:50,442
Have you adjusted to your position?

572
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:53,696
What are you talking about?

573
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,615
<i>I'm really struggling.</i>

574
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:02,621
-Young-soo, where are you now?
<i>-You know,</i>

575
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:05,541
when I see our boys
rip out a piece of paper

576
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:09,587
to use it as a fan
in this sweltering heat,

577
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,006
it really breaks my heart.

578
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:15,175
I'll ask for an AC unit.

579
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:18,470
We don't even have a table
where we can sit down and eat together.

580
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,139
I'll ask for that too.

581
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,016
A big table.

582
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,934
It'll be winter before you know it.

583
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,687
Do we even have a heater?
Of course, we don't have one.

584
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,897
As if you can hold out that long anyway…

585
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,446
Anyway, just hang up and go home.

586
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:39,867
Why is everyone so worried
about me getting home?

587
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:45,831
<i>I'm not the one
you should be worried about.</i>

588
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,293
You know that.

589
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:27,915
It's not me, you know?

590
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,376
Goodness.

591
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:32,920
Excuse me.

592
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,546
She became the target

593
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,090
because she was nice.

594
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:38,717
That's right.

595
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,720
The police…

596
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:48,268
The only thing we can do is…

597
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,317
I'm sorry.

598
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,113
I'm sorry.

599
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,076
I apologize.

600
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:29,268
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

601
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,687
Good morning, Chief Heo.

602
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,564
I guess you managed to get home safely.

603
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:36,358
Of course. Did you think I'd die
on the street or something?

604
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:39,445
As if. Even the fortune-teller said
you wouldn't die so easily.

605
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:41,780
So the fortune-teller wouldn't want you
to die like that.

606
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:44,616
And you know that I never black out
when I drink, right?

607
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,993
Keep on bragging.

608
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:49,705
An AC unit, a table, and a heater.

609
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,707
I remember everything.

610
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,751
-Get out of my way.
-Look.

611
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,753
I told you that
he'd be perfect for the job

612
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,755
and that he'd help us
identify the culprit.

613
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,924
The suspect is missing two fingers, right?

614
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,843
We were right about everything.

615
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,136
Am I wrong?

616
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:06,180
So why can't you trust us?

617
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,557
Have I ever said anything
that proved to be wrong?

618
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,725
No, right?

619
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,895
-You should get going.
-Yes, I should.

620
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:18,025
An AC unit, a table, and a heater.
I won't wait too long.

621
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:20,110
What do you want for lunch?

622
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:21,111
<i>Jjajangmyeon</i>.

625

REPORTER CHOI YOON-JI, FACT TODAY

626
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:53,602
Don't you know how to drive?

627
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:55,229
What were you thinking?

628
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,692
-Gosh.
-Did you get hurt?

629
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:02,277
My gosh.

630
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:04,446
Just a moment, please.

631
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,751
Excuse me, but could you
give me your hand for a moment?

632
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,003
What?

633
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:25,968
I don't have a business card.

634
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:28,470
Call that number if anything happens.

635
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,597
Handle it through your insurance
since you took pictures already.

636
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,599
I have an urgent matter to get to.
My apologies.

637
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,601
Where do you think you're going?

638
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,145
I'm sorry but I really have
an urgent matter to get to.

639
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:39,523
Handle it through insurance and call
that number if there are any issues.

640
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:40,440
I'm sorry.

641
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,402
Hey, wait.

642
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:44,695
Hold on.

643
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,447
This is my number.

644
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,701
REPORTER CHOI YOON-JI, FACT TODAY

645
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:54,871
-Hello, sir!
-Hello.

646
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,123
Good morning.

647
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,168
What are you reading?

648
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:02,379
It's just an article.

649
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,257
REPORTER CHOI YOON-JI

650
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,344
She's doing pretty well.

651
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:14,141
-Hello.
-Hi.

652
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,435
-Are you all right?
-Of course.

653
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:23,942
My gosh. How in the world
did the Behavioral Analysis Team

654
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:26,069
land a smart one like you?

655
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:28,530
Listen carefully.

656
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,240
They will give us an AC unit.

657
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:32,034
There's more.

658
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:33,619
-More?
-Yes.

659
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:35,078
A table?

660
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:36,663
-And there's one more.
-One more?

661
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:37,956
-Guess what.
-What is it?

662
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,124
A heater for winter.

663
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:46,131
Does that means we'll continue to
stay here and not in the main building?

664
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:49,676
I didn't think about it that way.
Shall I tell them to forgo the heater?

665
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:54,389
What's the problem? I like this place.

666
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,975
You've gotten used to this place too,
haven't you?

667
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:00,354
It's all right here.

668
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:03,023
-Let's ask for the heater.
-Yes, sir.

669
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,816
Now what?

670
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,235
Just give them what they want. All of it.

671
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,821
We have to give them what's necessary.

672
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,657
It's nothing special anyway.

673
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,660
That's not the problem right now though.

674
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:17,287
Kook Young-soo, that guy,
gave up his position as Chief of Forensics

675
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,790
to start a Behavioral Analysis Team
or whatever it is.

676
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:21,958
I get that he used to be
the godfather down at Forensics.

677
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:24,336
But that only matters
if he's still in the squad.

678
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:27,631
He's just a nobody to everyone else.

679
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,676
And what about that guy, Song Ha-young?

680
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,636
What was the point of promoting him?

681
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:35,347
Rumors about how he almost lost his job
from the Red Cap Incident

682
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,140
and how this is a failed team
have spread everywhere.

683
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:40,644
We're to blame
for how that rumor started though.

684
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:42,896
So we should be
taking responsibility for it!

685
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:44,481
What if their team disappears?

686
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:46,942
Where will those two go?
They're too old for the job market.

687
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:51,571
Shouldn't we put them to work
and evaluate them first

688
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:54,491
before we decide on
whether they'll put out results or not?

689
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:56,827
Gosh, I know! I'm aware of that too.

690
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,787
Just give them some time for now.

691
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,664
How much time? This is so frustrating.

692
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,499
I already asked the higher-ups

693
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:06,378
to at least give them some time
to interview criminals

694
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:08,588
and gather data on criminal types.

695
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:09,631
You did?

696
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,466
What are the higher-ups saying?

697
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,260
For this Cho Hyun-gil case,

698
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,262
the Behavioral Analysis Team
fulfilled their part

699
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,431
by helping us narrow down
the list of suspects.

700
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:22,602
Do you think we have an open-ended budget?

701
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,521
You know how they are.

702
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,691
They always groan and complain

703
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:30,485
about how we don't even have enough
to work in the field.

704
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:31,903
Goodness.

705
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:34,906
It's because you're too soft.

706
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:37,659
This is why I can't quit smoking.

707
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:42,289
It's cinnamon-flavored candy? Darn it.

708
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,251
Choi Yoon-ji was always
a bit different back in school too.

709
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:48,837
I guess you can say
that's her strength too.

710
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,298
No, of course not.

711
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:54,426
I'm grateful she chose to work here.

712
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:58,221
Yes, I'm grateful.

713
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,599
But I still need to make a living.

714
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:04,811
What's the use of being a conscious
reporter when the media is crumbling down?

715
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,189
Yes, that's right.

716
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:09,733
Stop talking about it
and put it into action.

717
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,989
-Is your hangover bad?
-I'm all right.

718
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:19,576
Do you even remember drunk dialing me
yesterday and harassing me,

719
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:20,702
saying how miserable you are?

720
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:25,707
I didn't say that because I was drunk.

721
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:29,169
I get it. It wasn't an easy case.

722
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:31,755
Good job. You did well.

723
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:35,300
But this isn't just about appealing
to the readers' emotions.

724
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:36,593
You see, a reporter…

725
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:39,137
That's enough advice for today, Director.

726
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:41,181
What's with the "but"?

727
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,599
Why do you think so?

728
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,060
That's my role, you rascal.

729
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,437
Let's go cure your hangover.

730
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:49,481
I need to get going in a bit.

731
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:51,525
At least get a bite before you leave.

732
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:52,818
You'll upset your stomach.

733
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,736
Okay, I'll eat before I go.

734
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,072
Aren't we done since we caught him?

735
00:51:57,864 --> 00:52:02,285
Even if everyone else thinks that way,
we have to think about what comes after.

736
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:03,954
-After this?
-Yes.

737
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:06,540
-Analyzing the mind.
-"Analyzing the mind"?

738
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,375
It's true that criminal profiling

739
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,877
is used in order to catch the culprit.

740
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,671
But what comes after that
is important too.

741
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:15,006
What does that have to do
with analyzing the mind?

742
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:18,093
It's not over when we catch the culprit.

743
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:19,594
There will always be
another one who appears.

744
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,012
Hold on.

745
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:23,807
You said you were going to
speak comfortably to me.

746
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:29,813
Did I say that?

747
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:32,774
I'll speak comfortably to you
if you don't do it first.

748
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:35,318
Since you've brought it up,
you go ahead and do that.

749
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:36,611
Should I do that then?

750
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:42,576
Captain Yoon!

751
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:47,289
Over here, Captain Yoon! Come sit here.

752
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:50,333
-We'll sit over there with them.
-Okay.

753
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,836
We just need to bring a chair over.

754
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:54,921
We just got started eating too,
so join us.

755
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,047
Yes, please join us.

756
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:58,633
-Two more orders of the set please, ma'am!
-Got it!

757
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,844
Please excuse us then.

758
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:02,345
What's there to excuse?

759
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:03,847
We're all on the same team.

760
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:08,894
Carry on with your conversation.

761
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,562
It seems like we interrupted it.

762
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,732
Whether criminals
who committed serious crimes can be

763
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:15,233
rehabilitated in prison or not.

764
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:18,612
Or if the rehabilitation program
needs some sort of change.

765
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:19,988
Or if there is a chance of recidivism.

766
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:23,074
We have to figure those things out.
That's what we were talking about.

767
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:26,995
Cho Hyun-gil committed the same crime
after just two months of being released.

768
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:30,707
That's why you want
to interview Cho Hyun-gil!

769
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:33,126
What? You're interviewing
Cho Hyun-gil again?

770
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:35,378
There's a lot we have to ask him.

771
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:37,631
Not only is he our team's first case,

772
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,799
but if we want to write our report
on criminal psychology analysis,

773
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:42,385
I think we'll have to meet him
at least once more.

774
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,471
This team is always working very hard.

775
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,848
If we want people to know

776
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:49,225
that the Behavioral Analysis Team
contributes to catching the culprit,

777
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:52,729
-we have to work harder.
-We have to show it's not interest

778
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:55,023
that motivates us,
but our sense of duty instead.

779
00:53:57,192 --> 00:54:00,528
It may just be an intriguing case
to you and your team,

780
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:02,238
but my team has a duty to solve it.

781
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:08,495
Whatever the case,

782
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,789
more heinous criminals will show up.

783
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,626
I hope my guess is wrong.
I'd be happy if I'm wrong.

784
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:18,505
But there still has to be someone
preparing for what may happen.

785
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:22,842
Thank you!

786
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:25,011
We have more than enough already.

787
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:28,181
Just how much more heinous will they get
for us to need to prepare?

788
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:31,685
Daesung Serial Murder Case.

789
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:40,193
That punk. We even released his montage
but why won't he get caught?

790
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:43,154
Those punks that commit serial murders

791
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:46,157
aren't in the range of normal
that we think of.

792
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:49,160
It's hard to track them down
the way we normally do.

793
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:51,788
What do you mean,
it's hard to track them down

794
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:54,290
the way we normally do?

795
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,584
If we look at the pattern of a crime,

796
00:54:56,668 --> 00:55:00,714
we can tell to an extent whether
it was resentment or blind passion.

797
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,924
That's right. It's clear as day.

798
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,592
But when it's none of these…

799
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:12,183
Guys who commit crimes
randomly and recklessly.

800
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:14,936
We can't read their behavior patterns.
Why is that?

801
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,521
Because they don't belong to any category.

802
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:19,691
Are you saying that's the case
with the Daesung Serial Murder Case?

803
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:21,109
That's right.

804
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,486
Once our team settles down…

805
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:26,448
He's the first one I want to catch.

806
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:29,367
He'll be caught before that.

807
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:31,911
Even though he stopped,

808
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,872
our investigation will continue.

809
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:35,165
Yes, he has to be caught.

810
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:38,293
He's the most wanted criminal
by the Korean police.

811
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:41,171
Please excuse me.

812
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:43,882
Wait for us. We're almost done too.

813
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:46,176
It's okay. You can take your time to eat.

814
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:47,677
Please excuse me.

815
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:50,346
-It's on me. Just go.
-Thank you.

816
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:59,230
Goodness. He is always so predictable.

817
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,067
Goodness.

818
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:18,583
UNRESOLVED CASE FILES, 1991

819
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:26,091
DAESUNG SERIAL MURDER CASE

820
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:32,222
<i>Anyway, what does that have to do
with a potentially atrocious case?</i>

821
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:33,807
<i>Listen up.</i>

822
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:38,019
In the US, heinous criminals
who only seek to murder

823
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:40,980
began to surface during
their biggest economic change.

824
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,732
There's a report on the correlation.

825
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,985
That's why we must be prepared.

826
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,531
<i>Anyhow,</i>

827
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:52,826
<i>Daesung Serial Murder Case
was way too shocking for me,</i>

828
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,077
<i>so I studied it extensively.</i>

829
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:59,165
<i>After I saw the cases from overseas,
I realized they're like smart criminals.</i>

830
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:03,253
<i>Their brains are wired only to murder.</i>

831
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:06,297
<i>That's why their MO and patterns
evolve over time.</i>

832
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:07,382
NONGSU-RO, HYUNGSAN-RI

833
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:08,758
<i>Here's what I mean.</i>

834
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:11,719
<i>The atrocity of their murder
and their crimes</i>

835
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:13,555
<i>will be taken to an extreme.</i>

836
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:17,225
<i>That's why they change the patterns
in an attempt to flee from us.</i>

837
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:23,731
<i>When they change the pattern and the MO,</i>

838
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:26,401
<i>catching them will be even harder.</i>

839
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,654
<i>If we do not get prepared,</i>

840
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:33,575
<i>we'll see another cold case
like the Daesung serial murders.</i>

841
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:40,707
-I see.
-It'd be wonderful if it doesn't happen.

842
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:44,085
I'm just trying to be prepared,
for just ten years.

843
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,714
I want to put in some work
for just ten years.

844
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,675
Then will our team last for ten years?

845
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:52,677
-Can you do this?
-Yes, I can, sir.

846
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:57,599
Anyway, thank you for listening
to my boring story.

847
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:58,725
Lunch is on me.

848
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:02,020
-No, it's all right.
-Thank you so much for lunch.

849
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,158
Goodness.

850
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,785
I have finally gone insane.

851
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:20,163
-What's wrong?
-My wallet.

852
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:24,709
-I'll pay.
-No.

853
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:26,794
That's not what I meant.

854
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:31,090
Captain Yoon.

855
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:36,554
Captain Yoon, something he said
has been bugging me.

856
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:38,640
What is?

857
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:42,519
No matter how crazy we are,
we have to say the right things.

858
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:44,437
To be frank, we caught Cho Hyun-gil.

859
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:48,441
Okay, I give them credit
for analyzing him and stuff.

860
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:50,360
But so what?

861
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:52,237
It's not like we don't try to guess
what the culprit is like.

862
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,781
We just can't be right all the time.

863
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:57,033
And if you think about it,
the same goes for that team.

864
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:00,453
They somehow ended up
guessing Cho Hyun-gil right.

865
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,121
They can't say they took part in…

866
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,540
That's mine.

867
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:06,876
Why? Did they say
they caught Cho Hyun-gil?

868
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,462
No, it's not like that.

869
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,798
I knew they'd get cheeky.

870
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:14,425
I told you not to let them take credit.

871
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,553
They should be grateful
they still have a job.

872
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,638
Everyone knows about the Red Cap Incident.

873
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:22,600
People in this field
are unbelievably talkative.

874
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:26,020
We're the ones who ran around
doing the footwork.

875
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:28,356
-Isn't that so?
-Stop it already.

876
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:30,275
Are we here to play a game of dart?

877
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:35,029
Trying to be infallible
in getting things right.

878
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:38,491
I don't appreciate the expressions
you've been using recently, okay?

879
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:39,617
I…

880
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:43,246
Okay. I'll be careful.

881
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:47,000
Try to think things over
before you say them out loud.

882
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,084
Yes, ma'am.

883
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:51,170
Finish your coffee and come.

884
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:52,880
Yes, ma'am.

885
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:54,882
What's with her?

886
00:59:56,884 --> 00:59:58,219
You owe me 200 won.

01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,482
Please relax your shoulders.

890
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:37,652
All right. Look into the camera.

891
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:40,321
I'll take the photo now.

892
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:41,280
Smile.

893
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:51,165

You can relax.

898
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:04,322
I'm the police.

899
01:03:05,406 --> 01:03:06,532
Right.

900
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:10,244
It's dangerous for a woman
to go around alone at night.

901
01:03:10,995 --> 01:03:12,121
Thank you.

902
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:14,332
Let me escort you.

903
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:17,627
I'm fine, but sure.

904
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:18,795
Let's go.

905
01:03:58,292 --> 01:04:01,254
<i>Did you dress up to see me?
I feel special.</i>

906
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:02,630
You want to hear my story?

907
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:04,590
<i>-Like what?
-You can tell us about you childhood</i>

908
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,467

01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:07,677
<i>We need you to take on a case.</i>

910
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,846
<i>He and his wife were murdered
in their home two weeks ago.</i>

911
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:11,597
<i>We weren't able to identify
what he hit them with yet.</i>

912
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:14,851
<i>-There's another one.
-Another case broke out.</i>

913
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:16,936
<i>This one is from Suseong-dong, Gangnam.</i>

914
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:19,480
<i>-And this one is from Gungok-dong, Jongno.
-Don't these look similar?</i>

915
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:21,232
<i>Who on earth is this guy?
The MO is the same.</i>

01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:23,818
<i>This is the third murder,
and his only purpose is to kill.</i>
