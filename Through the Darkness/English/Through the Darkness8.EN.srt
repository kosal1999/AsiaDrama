1
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,188
Are you okay?

2
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,566
Give them to me. Let me.

3
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,422
Call 119.

4
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,840
-What happened?
-Call 119 now.

5
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,009
Captain Yoon.

6
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,670
Gosh. What's taking them so long?

7
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,048
It's about the serial killer
who murdered the wealthy elderly, right?

8
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,675
Come on. Can't you just tell me?

9
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,805
You're here as a journalist,
not my friend.

10
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,182
I can't tell you anything.

11
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,768
Gosh. Okay. I got it.

12
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,187
Anyway, I'm staying here for the night.

13
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,510
-Why are you here?
-Hold on.

14
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,011
Come on.

15
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,347
You cannot enter.

16
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,557
Come on! Seriously.

17
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,476
Watch me get access to this place!

18
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,186
JOURNALISTS WITH ACCESS TO ENTER

19
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,575
Any update on Captain Yoon?

20
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,580
Luckily, he missed all the vital organs.

21
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,001
-Darn it.
-Hey.

22
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,674
That scumbag, Gu Young-chun.

23
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,009
-Hey.
-Hey.

24
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,427
How dare he stab a detective?

25
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,470
Hey. Control yourself.

26
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,097
Don't ruin this.

27
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,515
Sir!

28
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,183
Captain Yoon could have…

29
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,435
Hey. What about us?

30
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,645
What about me?

31
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,647
Do you think we're not enraged?

32
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,858
His rage is understandable!

33
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,860
My detective got stabbed!

34
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,114
Did you even help her, Song Ha-young?

35
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,327
How's Captain Yoon?

36
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,454
They treated the wound urgently.

37
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:31,164
But the stab wound was pretty deep,

38
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,541
so she has to stay in the hospital
for a few days.

39
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,171
I checked she was transferred
to a room and fell asleep.

40
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,007
Okay.

41
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:46,471
Captain Yoon is strong.
She'll be back before you know it.

42
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,680
All right.

43
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,016
I know that we are all worried about her.

44
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,143
So let's calm down.

45
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,687
And what about our guys in Nojin-dong?

46
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,898
They are working hard to find the bodies,

47
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,107
but no news yet.

48
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,735
What if that jerk lied about
burying them in the mountain?

49
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,447
Once we find the bodies,
his statement will be credible.

50
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,698
So we must hurry.

51
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,159
Okay. Captain Kook is at the scene.
So let's give them some time.

52
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,301
And one more thing. I'll interrogate him.

53
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,552
You stay here, Chief Kim.

54
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,013
Are you doing this
because he got away from me?

55
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,765
No. It's not that.

56
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,600
You cannot interrogate him first.

57
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:35,311
-Why not?
-I observed him during the interrogation.

58
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,188
And he likes to show off.

59
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,983
He thinks that he can control
what's happening to him.

60
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,568
See? I told you, didn't I?

61
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,278
He kept changing his statements
at Mapo Police Station.

62
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,531
He was toying with the detectives!

63
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:49,659
If you go in now, anyone below you
won't be able to interrogate him.

64
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,745
If we're not careful,

65
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,331
he will never talk.

66
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:59,502
Did you check
if he has any mental illnesses?

67
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,421
I did. He had a mental illness
caused by an epileptic seizure.

68
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,299
According to the records,
he was treated from 1992 to 1994.

69
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,803
Captain Yoon and I looked into

70
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,471
the records of mental illnesses
of violent offenders,

71
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,931
dating back to five years ago.

72
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,016
I guess five years weren't enough.

73
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,769
Your profiling report was correct, though.

74
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,064
Then let me interrogate him first.

75
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,943
Then you should interrogate him for now.

76
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,117
Hey.

77
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,412
What happened to the woman I stabbed?

78
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,247
Why?

79
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:39,667
I feel bad.

80
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,550
I don't need to hear your lies.

81
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,427
I've got your statement here.

82
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,970
So don't try anything funny.

83
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,479
It was all a lie.

84
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,689
I didn't kill them.

85
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,569
That scumbag is driving me nuts.

86
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,029
Then what is this?

87
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,075
I wrote it based on what I saw on TV.

88
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,495
It was all over the news, you know.

89
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,205
The locations and the method.

90
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,372
Is that so?

91
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,416
Then why did you lie?

92
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,170
Because you guys forced me to.

93
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:29,967
Right?

94
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,470
I don't think

95
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,306
you have the guts to kill anyone.

96
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:38,893
You killed 18 people
and secretly buried 11 of them?

97
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,562
It's all a lie.

98
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,650
Is this fun for you?

99
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,284
Do you want to know the truth?

100
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,955
Darn, that arrogant scumbag.

101
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:00,998
Can I please just go in now?

102
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,627
Can I not go in?

103
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,462
I can't let you.

104
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,800
You're all riled up. If you go in now,
things will get even worse.

105
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,594
Darn it. This is nuts!

106
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,806
Who's the boss here?

107
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:21,644
If you guys want me to talk,
go bring your boss.

108
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:22,895
You scum!

109
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,567
Do you want a promotion?

110
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,029
Don't you get a special promotion
for catching a killer like me?

111
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,948
You piece of shit.

112
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,914
This is why
I can't talk to you little fish.

113
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,126
Go get your boss.

114
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,547
I am the suspect in the case

115
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,759
where 18 people were killed
and 11 were secretly buried.

116
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:57,096
That punk is asking for me.

117
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,475
Fine, I shall go in
if he wants to talk to me.

118
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,520
No, leave it. I'll go in.

119
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,938
-What?
-Goodness.

120
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,482
At this rate, he'll ask to speak

121
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,277
to all the police executives one by one,

122
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,447
-don't you think?
-Hold on.

123
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,409
One moment.

124
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:19,952
-Hi.
-Why are you here?

125
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,829
I didn't want to interrupt.

126
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,914
-You got what I asked for?
-Yes, I have everything.

127
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,461
-What?
-You're still here?

128
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:29,545
Where else would I be…

129
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,130
-These four piles here?
-Yes, sir.

130
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,592
Oh, wait.

131
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,305
Take this too just in case,

132
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:40,931
Inspector Song.

133
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,394
You should leave.

134
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,612
Hey, what is all this?

135
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,407
Take these inside
and just put them on the table.

136
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,243
Glance at them,
but don't actually go through them.

137
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,163
To intimidate him, right?

138
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:07,083
Yes, just give him the impression
that we already know a lot.

139
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,501
Okay, got it.

140
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,044
-One more thing.
-What?

141
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,463
He gets offended
if we use an interrogating tone.

142
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,882
-It ticks him off.
-I see.

143
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,801
Just coddle him at first.

144
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:21,222
Once the real interrogation begins,
he'll lean back in his chair.

145
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,556
Is he a king or what?

146
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,933
All right, I got it.

147
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:24,934
Here, thanks.

148
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,061
-No, let me.
-Thanks.

149
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,187
Just a moment.

150
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,065
-Take this too.
-Okay, got it.

151
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,233
ROBBERY SUSPECT WANTED

152
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,204
All right.

153
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,711
You can talk to me now.

154
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,550
Finally, someone on my level.
What's your title?

155
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,260
Are you the captain?

156
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,303
I'm higher than a captain.

157
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,099
I'm a senior superintendent.
Four hibiscus flowers.

158
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,017
I'm the head of Criminal Investigations.

159
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:09,854
The head?

160
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,564
Listen, Gu Young-chun.

161
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,276
Dragging this out will only make things
more difficult for you.

162
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:19,655
You know, cops aren't idiots.

163
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,076
Let's see.

164
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,538
My gosh.

165
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,958
You can draw pretty well.

166
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,961
I was pretty good at drawing
when I was young.

167
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,088
Is that right?

168
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,674
I see.

169
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:39,717
But you know,

170
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:44,096
you drew even the details
that we never disclosed to the media.

171
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,807
How did you know these details?

172
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,143
Where the safe was

173
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:52,813
and whether it was standing upright
or knocked over.

174
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,565
You even drew these things,

175
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,568
which means you were there. Am I wrong?

176
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,571
Then…

177
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:02,948
Look at this.

178
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,743
Anyone would say this is
a picture of you taken from behind.

179
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,329
And your face is on this thing.

180
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,289
Which means…

181
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,585
you'll get caught in no time

182
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:15,544
Do you understand?

183
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,771
Give me

184
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,315

And…

193
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,983
there are ten more?

194
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,613
Where did you bury them? You scum!

195
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,587
-Sir.
-What?

196
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,344
Here! We found it!

-Here too!

-Dig it up.

-There's one too!
-Over here too.

201
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,490
Here too!

202
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,701
-Here too!
-We have something here too!

203

Here! We found it!

211
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,328

<i>Here's the report of the case</i>

220
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,306
<i>given by the superintendent
of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.</i>

221
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:25,437
Hello, I'm Superintendent Baek Jun-sik
of the Detective Division.

222
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:32,611
Let me brief you on the arrest
of Gu Young-chun, the serial killer.

223
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:37,866
The police received a report
on a serial abduction case of sex workers.

224
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,494
On the 5th, around 5:30 a.m.,

225
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:43,080
we arrested the suspect, Gu Young-chun.

226
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,958
To date, Gu Young-chun
confessed to having killed

227
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,835
a total of 18 people.

228
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,504
We took Gu Young-chun

229
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,840
to the place he claimed
to have buried the bodies,

230
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,717
the mountain in Nojin-dong,
Seodaemun-gu, Seoul.

231
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:59,179
We found a total of 11 unidentified bodies
buried in secret

232
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:02,850
-of women in their 20s and 30s.
-My goodness, 11 bodies?

233
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,853
Are there any additional crimes?

234
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,521
Does he have any accomplices?

235
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,815
Thus far in our investigation,

236
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:13,694
we confirmed that he did this alone
without an accomplice.

237
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,530
<i>We are also pressing him to find out
if he committed additional crimes.</i>

238
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:19,116
POLICE FOUND 11 BURIED BODIES

239
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,332
<i>This is a mountain near Nojin-dong, Seoul.</i>

240
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,834
<i>Once they started digging,</i>

241
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,295
<i>they could see the body
of a woman in her 20s.</i>

242
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:34,256
<i>A total of 11 bodies
were found in this area.</i>

243
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,465
<i>All of the bodies were severely…</i>

244
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,467
One interview with Gu first.

245
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,304
<i>There were many trees
around where the bodies were buried,</i>

246
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,306
<i>and it's also situated
deep inside of the mountain,</i>

247
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,892
<i>somewhere tough
to be spotted from the road.</i>

248
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,352
<i>The police are making an attempt
to identify…</i>

249
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,731
Is your piece worth some clicks?

250
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,027
<i>The colleagues of these dead women
came to the crime scene</i>

251
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,487
<i>and watched with wretched hearts.</i>

252
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:04,077
THE WORST KILLER IN HISTORY ARRESTED
HELPED BY FATE

253
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,167
SERIAL KILLER ARRESTED

254
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,169
IF ONLY THE POLICE HAD ACTED FASTER…

255
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,838
I think I'm done packing.

256
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,388
You can just blame him

257
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,391
for the Southwestern Case too.

258
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,310
It all looks like his doing.

259
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,855
He says he didn't do that,
so we have to continue to check.

260
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,774
How can you believe what he says?

261
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,401
Start digging up everything
with the premise he's the culprit

262
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,029
so that he won't be able
to make another excuse.

263
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,657
I can't quite put a finger on
how far his crimes stretch.

264
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,910
We're looking through
every other cold case we have,

265
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,411
not just the Southwestern Case.

266
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,248
Put all of these cases together,
then do your best

267
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,084
to get him to confess.

268
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,418
Commissioner,

269
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,337
you already know
we'll get into bigger trouble

270
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,465
if the prosecution doesn't find
any evidence after he's transferred.

271
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:01,468
What we need to do is
resolve this pressing incident!

272
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:04,930
Try to find a way to avoid responsibility

273
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,765
by turning Gu Young-chun into the suspect.

274
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,143
<i>With every minute,
the media are pumping out stories</i>

275
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,813
<i>on Gu Young-chun
and all kinds of other cold cases.</i>

276
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,190
<i>We have to throw them something</i>

277
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,693
<i>to turn away the criticism pointed at us.</i>

278
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,361
<i>Yes, I understand.</i>

279
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,365
Are you still trying to see
if he committed other crimes?

280
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,574
Yes.

281
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,910
Captain Yoon is interrogating him.

282
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,414
We've been going days
without getting any sleep.

283
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,873
Chief Kim and Captain Yoon

284
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,376
are taking turns with the cold cases.

285
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,004
Man, they are about to blow up
trying to humor that man,

286
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,255
who's not even human.

287
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,425
He claims to have committed
every single case we bring up.

288
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:44,177
He says he would've killed 100 people
if he hadn't been caught.

289
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:47,472
That psycho.
Does he think he's some kind of a hero?

290
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,434
If we upset him,
he'd change his argument right away.

291
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,645
He's the first man who didn't budge
despite my awful temper.

292
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,605
Other than you.

293
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,399
Ha-young does not bite crazy dogs.

294
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,443
-You little…
-What?

295
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,485
Hey.

296
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,488
How can you still have
enough energy to bicker?

297
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,990
WEAPON IS THE SIZE OF A CAMPING KNIFE

298
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,533
Another camping knife.

299
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,369
Yes, we're checking
if Gu Young-chun is also the suspect

300
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,038
in the Dongjak
and Geumcheon Station cases.

301
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,122
But he denied those.

302
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:14,082
-I also doubt this is his doing.
-What?

303
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,793
Why not? Gu Young-chun said he did this.

304
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,795
I remember reading it
on a Daily Case Report.

305
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,923
This case was already reported, but
we missed it because it's Dongdaemun-gu.

306
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:25,510
This is why we need to improve
cooperation between jurisdictions.

307
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:28,180
I finally get what you mean
after going through this.

308
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:30,432
The Analysis Team can be very nosy.

309
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,684
You're always trying to get too much done.

310
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,312
-Hey.
-Those above tell us to blame him.

311
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,773
But those nuisances suggest
that it can't be him.

312
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:41,485
But the jerk who actually killed
all these people is just…

313
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,237
Darn it. Man.

314
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:47,991
Man, unbelievable.

315
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:52,037
Captain Yoon is getting his confession
on the Imyeong-dong case right now.

316
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,955
You said his MO or whatever changed.

317
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,082
MO: MODUS OPERANDI, A CRIME METHOD

318
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,249
So wouldn't that work?

319
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:57,959
No.

320
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,796
This is an entirely different case.

321
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,556
Were you after cash?

322
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,934
They were dressed nicely.

323
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,228
It looked like they had some money.

324
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,983
I showed my police ID and approached her,

325
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,444
but she got scared and began to step back.

326
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,322
I'm the police!

327
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,825
Why would she run away?

328
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:33,370
Was it because I looked shabby?
I suddenly lost it.

329
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,874
So?

330
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,918
You followed her and stabbed her?

331
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,841
Detective, thanks to me,
you'll get promoted.

332
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,428
It's my way of paying you back
for stabbing you.

333
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,101
Gu Young-chun.

334
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:02,274
No matter how we look at it,
the Imyeong-dong case wasn't him.

335
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:03,650
No.

336
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,695
He's not the type who would switch

337
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,321
from a hammer to a camping knife.

338
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,075
I wouldn't say his MO changes.

339
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,495
It simply seems like
he was after stronger stimulants.

340
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,306
Are you feeling better?

341
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,766
Yes, I'm all right.

342
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,185
I'm glad.

343
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,228
Goodbye.

344
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,400
By the way…

345
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,740
The Imyeong-dong case…

346
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,660
probably wasn't Gu Young-chun, right?

347
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,333
Goodbye.

348
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,296
<i>The police are conducting
further investigation to find other crimes</i>

349

354
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:17,432
<i>The police shared their plans
to conduct further investigation.</i>

355
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:20,977
<i>If he's found to be guilty
of the Imyeong-dong case,</i>

356
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,521
<i>-the total number of victims</i>
-What?

357
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:24,814
<i>he created will reach</i>

358
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,233
<i>-a total of 19 people.</i>
-I did that.

359
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:29,486
<i>The Imyeong-dong Murder Case
broke out last January in</i>

360
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,904
<i>-Imyeong-dong, Dongdaemun-gu.</i>
-That jerk.

361
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:32,822
<i>The victim, Kim, was found
lying dead on the street</i>

362
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,367
<i>-after getting stabbed.</i>
-I'll kill you.

363
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,203
<i>The case remained unresolved to this day.</i>

364
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,581
<i>On the other hand,
the police will wrap up the investigation</i>

365
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:44,376
<i>and hand him over
with the investigation record</i>

366
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,877
<i>to the prosecution tomorrow.</i>

367
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,713
<i>He's to be transferred tomorrow,
but until today,</i>

368
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:52,717
<i>the police believed
he has committed more crimes,</i>

369
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,762
<i>so they have been putting all manpower
into interrogating him.</i>

370
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,931
Why did you choose them as your victims?

371
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:01,351
Mr. Gu! Is there a last word
you want to leave to the world?

372
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,234
I hope this becomes

373
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:15,282
the motivation for women
to be more careful with themselves.

374
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:19,661
I also hope the rich

375
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,163
will wake up too.

376
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,291
Anything else?

377
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,295
-Mr. Gu! Do you regret this?
-Excuse me.

378
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,964
-Anything else you want to say?
-Just one more word!

379
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,090
Why did you change the MO?

380
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,759
-Do you feel bad for the victims?
-Mr. Gu!

381
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,678
Just say one more word!

382
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,480
THE SAFEST CITY SEOUL

SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

384
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:59,701
<i>You can't transfer him immediately
without a chance for us to see him!</i>

385
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,662
He felt too offended to meet anybody.

386
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,039
What can I do?

387
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,791
Man, all of our staff
are trying to humor him

388
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,877
just to get a word out of his mouth.

389
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,838
He drained us through
the interrogation and field search.

390
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,424
Gu Young-chun isn't an ordinary suspect.

391
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:15,675
No, he's not ordinary.

392
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,260
That's why we must see him.

393
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,220
I'll be there soon.

394
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,058
He refuses to meet anybody. What can I do?

395
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:27,437
He murdered over 20 victims including
other crimes he claimed to have committed.

396
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,731
If you rub him the wrong way,
he might change his statement again,

397
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,107
which will cause more trouble.

398
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:34,944
I'm going home.

399
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,281
Is it that hard to do? Gil-pyo.

400
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,215
<i>A profiler's question is</i>

401
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,342
<i>a sort of enticement.</i>

<i>To get what we want,</i>

403
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,348
<i>we must fully understand the suspects.</i>

404
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,935
<i>To do that,</i>

405
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,478
<i>I must become Gu Young-chun now.</i>

406
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:13,900
<i>And I suppress my anger for a moment.</i>

407
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,155
<i>I am…</i>

408
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,241

SEOUL DETENTION CENTER

410
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,064
-It's good.
-Okay.

411
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,355
It's cloudy today.

412
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,448
The investigation is over.
What else is there left?

413
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,868
We're not investigators.

414
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,119
Aren't you detectives?

415
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,997
You were there when I was arrested.

416
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,458
I used to be. But not now.

417
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,793
Then what do you do?

418
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:58,004
Our job is to find out
the causes behind these incidents

419
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,923
and analyze the causes.

420
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,174
So…

421
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:04,636
Are you like criminal behavioral analysts?

422
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:05,887
Like psychologists?

423
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,306
Something like that.

424
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:09,641
So you know what we do.

425
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,851
Most people don't.

426
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,688
I was curious about my psychology too.

427
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,398
I wondered about that.

428
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:18,775
All right.

429
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,529
Then before we discuss that,

430
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:26,366
why don't we go over some questions
we have about each case?

431
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:27,909
Sure.

432
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:32,080
The man next to me is the captain.
He'll ask you those questions.

433
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:36,417
First of all, why did you make
your own murder weapon?

434
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:40,171
At first, I used a knife
and tried it out on a dog.

435
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,549
But the dog kept bleeding

436
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,259
and ran away instead of dying.

437
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,386
So I switched to a steel hammer.

438
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,597
A long handle was cumbersome
when I grabbed it.

439
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,349
And it didn't fit in my bag either.

440
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:53,309
So I shortened it.

441
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,979
Why did you stop killing
after the APB was issued?

442
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:58,565
You say you are
a criminal behavioral analyst.

443
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,567
Isn't that obvious?

444
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,946
My photo was all over the country.
I had to be careful.

445
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:07,782
You're right.

446
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:13,121
So we could suspect
that you were a careful guy.

447
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:16,875
And you didn't leave any evidence
because you were careful.

448
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:17,959
You bet.

449
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:21,880
Perfect crimes require thorough planning.

450
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:24,048
There are no perfect crimes.

451
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,508
You failed to catch me.

452
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:26,885
We got you. So you're here.

453
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,012
I'm here because I confessed.

454
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,018
Well…

455
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:37,437
You stated that
you started a fire in Hwanghwa-dong

456
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,939
to remove any possible
bloodstains from you.

457
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:43,234
I wanted to break the safe,
so I used a golf club and a crowbar.

458
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,072
<i>But I couldn't open it.
I only ended up hurting my hand.</i>

459
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,534
<i>I guess safes in Korea are pretty sturdy.</i>

460
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,087
The fire was put out quickly.

461
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:07,008
I know. I watched from nearby.

462
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,929
<i>Were you watching
to make sure it was burning?</i>

463
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:14,766
<i>I was anxious.
So I watched the house from afar.</i>

464
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,101
Starting a fire wasn't easy either.

465
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,896
I had no idea it would go out that fast.

466
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,272
It did go out pretty fast.

467
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,441
Weren't you worried
we might have found your blood?

468
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,818
I didn't think much of it.

469
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,405
Why did you steal
the jacket when you left?

470
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,576
I ran into an unexpected situation.

471
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,537
So I got nervous, and it got a bit cold.

472
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,082
<i>I had a lot of blood on my clothes.</i>

473
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,876
<i>And I happened to see it, so I put it on.</i>

474
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,629
And you threw it out afterward?

475
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,464
I gave it to a homeless man
on my way home.

476
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,383
Did you throw out the hiking boots?

477
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,843
I threw them out
because that was on the posters.

478
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,262
You were very careful indeed.

479
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,056
What about the blood-stained clothes?

480
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,601
Based on your statement,
you didn't change your clothes.

481
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,396
People don't care
if you have blood on your clothes.

482
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,272
When I got worried,

483
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:06,734
I went into a restroom at a building
or a subway station to wipe it.

484
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,736
Everyone is busy with their own lives.

485
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,906
People aren't that interested in others.

486
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:15,910
They only show interest
when someone like me appears.

487
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,291
I see.

488
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,922
You've never seen a killer like me, right?

489
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,265
Do you think you're special?

490
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,560
Isn't that why
you guys came here to see me?

491
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:41,936
You're asking a lot of questions too.

492
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,481
We want to know people of your kind.

493
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,316
We're not interested in you, per se.

494
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,492
I'll continue with the questions.

495
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:00,121
Let's look at the murder cases
of the elderly.

496
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,165
Houses without no security systems

497
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,125
in that rich neighborhood…

498
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:12,091
<i>Gu Young-chun is different
from the criminals we've met so far.</i>

499
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,384
His attitude during interrogation

500
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,344
shows his confidence
in not leaving any evidence behind

501
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,889
and a sense of superiority
about his crimes.

502
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,141
I also noticed that
when he admitted his crimes.

503
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,644
Our approach needs to be
a bit more thorough.

504
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,188
Like how?

505
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:30,068
For example, we don't have to directly
let him know that he chose easy locations.

506
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,945
So you don't want to provoke him?

507
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:36,949
Right.

508
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,579
Other than the security systems,

509
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:44,832
was there a factor you considered
when choosing locations?

510
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,292
Security systems?

511
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,668
I don't know about them.

512
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,338
I just chose a house close to a church.

513
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:54,592
A church? Why?

514
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,720
The deity is right next-door,
but He won't help.

515
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,388
And I wanted to prove that.

516
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:04,143
I was the one who decided
whether they would live or die.

517
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:09,190
Have you ever thought
that the deity didn't help you?

518
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,441
A lot of times.

519
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:12,902
I always thought so.

520
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,115
I got caught stealing at the age of 20
and had to stand trial.

521
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,867
My lawyer said
I would get off with probation.

522
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,661
And…

523
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:26,874
I desperately said I'd live a good life
if He would keep me away from prison.

524
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:30,545
But He didn't do that.

525
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,380
So…

526
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:35,716
is that why you think He abandoned you?

527
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,345
Who abandoned whom?

528
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,347
Those who believe in Him are pathetic.

529
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,850
They pretend to be holy,

530
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,977
but they chase money
and look down on others.

531
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,773
Have you been to my house?

532
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,359
Yes.

533
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,736
You know the bathroom threshold?

534
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,865
<i>The threshold…</i>

535
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,577
<i>is the line that separates
the living realm and underworld.</i>

536
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,164
<i>The line between life and death</i>

537
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,040
<i>which is decided and ruled by me.</i>

538
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,548
Anyone who crossed that line
didn't make it out alive.

539
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:28,686
Why did you cut up the bodies
before abandoning them?

540
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,564
It must not have been easy.

541
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:33,149
Have you killed anyone?

542
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:38,905
If I had,

543
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:41,741
we wouldn't be here.

544
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,409
Right.

545
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,786
You would be in there with me.

546
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,498
If you haven't done it,

547
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,833
how do you know it's hard?

548
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,252
Have you met with other murderers?

549
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,671
That's our job.

550
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:59,217
Of course, it wasn't easy.

551
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,429
<i>To liven up the mood,</i>

552
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:06,307
<i>I played grand music
when I worked on the bodies.</i>

553
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,785
Why? Were you afraid?

554
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,546
Give me a paper and a pen.

555
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,007
I can't. But why?

556
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,803
Do you think I'm going
to kill you with a pen?

557
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,639
Are you scared of me
when all my limbs are bound?

558
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:51,310
You seemed curious to know
how I cut the bodies.

559
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,562
I was going to draw it for you.

560
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,009
The X-ray you had in your room.

561
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,136
Was it for this?

562
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,179
That's right.

563
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,806
I studied a lot.

564
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:14,435
I also read a lot of books
on forensic pathology.

565
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:15,644
They tell you

566
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:19,315
exactly when and where to cut
to make the job easier.

567
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:24,236
All that effort for what?

568
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,240
You see, people don't die easily.

569
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,868
They're not small, and to survive--

570
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,537
You already said that was why
you chose the steel hammer.

571
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,755
Oh, right. I did.

572
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:46,467
And you know what?

573
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,594
When you cut up a body,

574
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:52,139
things are a lot easier if you deplete
blood and wait until rigor mortis.

575
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,768
You need efficiency in whatever you do.

576
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,687
"Efficiency"?

577
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,774
And to be efficient, you need to study.

578
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:05,319
I bet no one here knows more
about human anatomy than I do.

579
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,947
I'm sure I know more
than the two of you do.

580
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,911
You sure had to be "efficient"

581
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:15,538
to take care of 11 bodies.

582
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,794
Then why did you mark the spots
where you buried the bodies?

583
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,633
<i>Why did he leave a mark
only he would recognize?</i>

584
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:30,344
<i>Was it a type of sentimental act,
to remember what he did?</i>

585
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:35,641
To bury other bodies there,
time after time,

586
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:38,436
<i>I had to remember the spots
so I wouldn't dig them up again.</i>

587
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,122
And they'd be uncomfortable too,
even though they're dead.

588
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:01,041
I let them hear the stream nearby
so they wouldn't be bored.

589
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,918
I was trying to be considerate.

590
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:12,470
Anyway, I did that a few times

591
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,762
and got used to it.

592
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:22,438
<i>I was wrong to expect
that the devil would have feelings.</i>

593
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:24,690
<i>He has no emotions.</i>

594
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:28,903
<i>All he cares about is comforting himself
and justifying his actions.</i>

595
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,238
Is that why you desecrated the bodies?

596
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,116
You see, I'm a very curious person.

597
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,077
After killing someone,

598
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,039
what's next?

599
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,211
I chopped up the body.

600
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,213
Then what's next?

601
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,555
Have you heard of Richard Chase?

602
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:04,104
No, never.

603
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:07,691
He's an American serial killer
who drank his victims' blood.

604
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:10,110
He suffered from schizophrenia,

605
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,238
so he desecrated the victims
and ate their remains.

606
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:15,491
But he just did it in a crazy state
without any knowledge of anatomy.

607
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:18,702
But that's not what I did.

608
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,664
I'm different.

609
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:27,169
I see that you studied a lot about murder.

610
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:31,006
I enjoy studying
because I'm a curious person.

611
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:38,347
Let's take a break for lunch.
We can resume after lunch.

612
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:45,980
Can you eat after hearing all this?

613
00:42:57,324 --> 00:43:02,580
SNACK SHOP

614
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:05,791
I wanted to curse at him so badly.
I had to bite my tongue.

615
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,086
A bottle of water, please.

616
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:10,879
I want another bottle too.

617
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,049
-I bet you have no appetite now.
-No, I don't.

618
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,301
It's 1,000 won.

619
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:17,886
Thank you.

620
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:31,817
After the break, you should go in alone.

621
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:35,654
I'm just so angry.

622
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,323
I'm afraid I'll ruin it.

623
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,993
I think it's better that you go in alone

624
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:43,579
to make sure we don't fall for his tricks.

625
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:49,251
We might be overestimating someone
who's just a crazy loser.

626
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:58,886
<i>From now on,
I'm going to deal with him my own way.</i>

627
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,739
Where did the other one go?

628
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,783
I guess you're pretty brave.

629
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,498
We heard enough about the case,
so I came in alone.

630
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,084
Then what do you want to talk about now?

631
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,878
Why did you confess
to the Imyeong-dong case?

632
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,005
You didn't do it.

633
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:52,106
Well, have you ever wondered
how you ended up like this?

634
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,944
Don't people like me
all have the same story?

635
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,488
An abusive father.

636
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,574
And a miserable childhood
with no one to lean on.

637
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:05,702
So do you blame your father?

638
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,913
You've never lived with a father

639
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:09,915
who threatens you with a hammer
every time he gets drunk, right?

640
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:12,793
I never lived with my father.

641
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:14,837
He passed away the day I was born.

642
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:17,714
You're lucky.

643
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,843
It's better to not have one
than to grow up with a father like that.

644
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:22,344
No wonder I'm like this.

645
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,516
You think that's the reason?

646
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:31,937
I thought you were
a criminal behavioral analyst.

647
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:35,816
Didn't you hear such a childhood
could cause you to become a serial killer?

648
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,363
You see, prison is full of them.

649
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,033
Those who have no one to lean on
just like me.

650
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,203
Those who are all alone in this world.

651
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:52,833
Why did you start

652
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:56,128
luring your victims to your home
instead of breaking into their homes?

653
00:45:57,671 --> 00:46:00,841
As I said, it was because
my home was the place

654
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:03,343
where I decided
whether or not they could live.

655
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,472
Not because you were afraid to be caught

656
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:08,348
after you saw the security footage?

657
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,559
I killed almost 20 people.

658
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,478
I didn't leave any evidence,

659
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:15,105
and I figured out an easy way
to take care of the bodies,

660
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,231
so why take a risk?

661
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,569
So it wasn't because you were afraid?

662
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:21,487
No.

663
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,405
It was not out of fear.

664
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:27,576
It was because
I could kill them unhindered at my place.

665
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:30,787
Why did you stop receiving treatment
for your epilepsy?

666
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,501
I was there too.

667
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:36,752
Darn it.

668
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,630
So you saw everything.

669
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:42,216
Even being hospitalized didn't help.

670
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:47,346
Nothing was going my way.
The only thing I could do was kill.

671
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,806
I guess you had many aspirations.

672
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:51,808
When I was young,

673
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:54,728
I wanted to be an artist.

674
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:59,149
But you need money to do that.

675
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:03,111
-So I thought about becoming a cop…
-A cop?

676
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,698
Power, influence, and money.

677
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:09,993
The most important things in life.
Without it, you get looked down on.

678
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:11,578
But…

679
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:17,042
aren't cops just
a corrupt group of people too?

680
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:18,961
Why do you think that?

681
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:21,964
When I forged the police ID card
and used it to get money,

682
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,757
people gave it up so naturally.

683
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,219
This world where
the wealthy get rich illegally,

684
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:29,721
women live promiscuously,

685
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:32,140
and civil servants live like bugs!

686
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,435
They all have to be punished!

687
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,148
If I don't do it,

688
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:42,276
who will punish them?

689
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:44,861
You talk as if

690
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,989
you're implementing social justice.

691
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:52,369
Do you have the right to do that?

692
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:56,999
Well, I wouldn't say I have the right.

693
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:00,252
But killing is sort of like my job.

694
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,800
Your job?

695
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:10,470
I'm doing the job that needs to be done.

696
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:14,933
So…

697
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:18,937
is that why you only chose those
who were weaker than you?

698
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,650
You know very well yourself

699
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,902
just how pathetic that is,
right, Gu Young-chun?

700
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:28,155
What?

701
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,365
You have no right to punish them.

702
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,992
That goes for everyone else too.

703
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,579
Even if they committed a crime,

704
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:39,207
they should be punished
within the limits of the law, not by you.

705
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:44,630
So don't try
to justify your horrible actions

706
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:47,090
with that ridiculous reasoning.

707
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:49,718
-You're wrong.
-Gu Young-chun.

708
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:53,722
You are…

709
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:57,392
just a pathetic murderer.

710
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:24,920
<i>Gu Young-chun is just a nasty scumbag</i>

711
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,839
<i>who gave divine meaning to his actions,</i>

712
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:31,134
<i>then substituted his helplessness
with anger and attacked people.</i>

713
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:52,114
-That was tough, right?
-No, it was fine.

714
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:02,624
Would you like to get dinner?

715
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,503
Yes, let's do that.

716
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,717
What are you doing?

717
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,009
Song Ha-young.

718
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:18,682
Are you okay?

719
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:20,934
Yes, I'm okay.

720
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:23,812
Pace yourself.

721
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:24,771
Okay.

722
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:41,037
He said killing was his job.

723
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,122
Who did?

724
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:44,750
Gu Young-chun?

725
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,461
That crazy scumbag.

726
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:56,595
Before this, I never heard from anyone

727
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,640
about what they studied
in order to cut up the bodies

728
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:04,394
and what they felt while mutilating them.

729
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:07,981
On top of that…

730
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,026
never in my life…

731
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:17,199
did I see a face
so full of superiority and joy.

732
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:20,786
You did good work.

733
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,084
Captain.

734
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:30,378
What is it?

735
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:32,464
Why was it me of all people?

736
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:36,343
Why did it have to be me

737
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:38,678
for a job like this?

738
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:45,560
Ha-young, that…

739
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,521
You said you have cigarettes
for emergencies, right?

740
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,689
Would I feel a little better…

741
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,234
if I got drunk?

742
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,205
I'm sorry.

743
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,584
I'll get going first.

744
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:59,069
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

745
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,529
-Hello, sir.
-Yes, hello.

746
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,198
Hey. Sit down.

747
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,492
Are you okay?

748
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,035
What did the prosecution say
about Gu Young-chun?

749
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,287
Gu Young-chun, that punk.

750
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:11,706
He's giving them a hard time too.

751
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,917
A leopard can't change its spots.

752
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:22,842
What's with everyone's looks?

753
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:26,596
Oh, right. I know very well
that quote speaks directly to me.

754
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,765
-Gosh.
-My goodness.

755
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:30,558
Oh, another thing.

756
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:33,770
When you write up
Gu Young-chun's case report,

757
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:36,690
we were told to also write the lessons
we learned from this investigation.

758
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:40,568
Think hard about what we didn't do well
and what we did well

759
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,237
and prepare for a meeting to discuss them.

760
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,822
-Got it?
-Yes, sir.

761
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:48,118
PUREUMAE PARK, DONGJAK-GU

762
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:06,761
It was at night.

763
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:16,271
CHUNGMUN-DONG, DOBONG-GU

764
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,586
Song Ha-young, that snake.

765
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:43,882
He's not still using the special promotion
to make your life harder, right?

766
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,427
What are you saying all of a sudden?

767
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:50,055
You know how fast I can pick things up.

768
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:52,432
I'm just saying this because
I've been watching the two of you

769
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:55,268
since I joined the team,
and things seemed awkward.

770
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:58,396
Song Ha-young, that punk
only pretends to be righteous.

771
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,816
I already know how good he is
at betraying people.

772
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:06,613
Hey.

773
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:11,326
Even after what your suspect,
Jung Soo-chang, said that day,

774
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:13,453
I never told anybody else.

775
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:17,540
But you don't know
what Song Ha-young will do.

776
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:18,875
Who…

777
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:22,045
told you what?

778
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,047
Jung Soo-chang.

779
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,341
Did you forget?

780
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:29,969
Come on, you can't forget that.

781
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:32,722
He was blabbing on and on about it
during my interrogation.

782
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:36,101
I can tell you now that I beat him up
so he wouldn't speak up again.

783
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:37,310
You didn't know, right?

784
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:41,189
You got promoted thanks to me.

785
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:51,908
Let's find out
if you'll also become a big shot.

786
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,370
Darn you.

787
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:19,102
Come in.

788
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,358
Is something going on?

789
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:29,279
I was on my way home,

790
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:31,281
but I saw the lights on,

791
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:33,283
so I decided to stop by.

792
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:36,161
You're still here.

793
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:40,290
I had to check something.

794
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:45,295
For the Southwestern Case?

795
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:46,838
Oh, yes.

796
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:51,092
We first thought Gu Young-chun did that,

797
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:55,972
but our team is also turning the case

798
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,975
in a different direction now.

799
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,062
I requested cooperation.

800
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:08,026
I'll let you know
if we get any other reports.

801
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:11,362
I see. Thank you.

802
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,364
These horrible criminals

803
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:16,534
continue to swarm out.

804
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:18,286
Indeed.

805
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:23,958
You should go home and get some rest.
It'll take some time for you to heal.

806
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,084
I had…

807
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:31,007
misunderstood you, Inspector Song.

808
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:33,593
What do you mean?

809
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:34,886
Right before my promotion,

810
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,890
I said I wanted to right the wrong

811
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:42,185
because I did not catch Jung Soo-chang.

812
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:47,607
Do you remember what you said?

813
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,234
Why do you suddenly ask?

814
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:56,699
I said you caught Jung Soo-chang.

815
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:57,784
Yes.

816
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:00,912
You said…

817
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,749
the same thing back then.

818
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:08,002
I knew you were going through a tough time
because of that stalker.

819
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:11,756
I also know how people around you
laughed it off

820
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:14,592
and said it's because you're popular.

821
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,636
But it's also true that I was afraid

822
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:20,265
even though I was a cop
who should be arresting the culprit.

823
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:22,684
Also,

824
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:25,937
someone became a witness to that moment,

825
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:28,356
which made me

826
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:31,401
embarrassed and tormented.

827
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,074
Well, detectives are humans too.

828
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,411
Everyone faces such a moment of horror.

829
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:44,247
The same goes for me too.

830
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:50,920
I only stopped you from getting hurt.

831
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:52,463
You were the one

832
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:56,175
who arrested him, Captain Yoon.

833
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:01,139
Thank you.

834
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:04,017
I think

835
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:09,105
I wanted to say that.

836
01:00:10,898 --> 01:00:14,444
Well, of course, you may not be curious

837
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:17,697
about what I think.

838
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:25,038
I only did my job.

839
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:30,585
All right, then.

840
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:33,463
Please excuse me.

841
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:36,341
All right. Goodbye.

HWANGHWA-DONG CASE

844
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:33,856
FACIAL COMPOSITE RESULT

845
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:13,479
STAY TUNED FOR THE EPILOGUE

846
01:02:38,629 --> 01:02:40,173
What will we be left with?

847
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:43,384
While looking into the darkness,

848
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:44,844
our hearts break into pieces.

849
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,929
How can we fill that void?

850
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:50,349
I also thought long and hard about it.

851
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:52,059
But you know,

852
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:56,189
no cigarettes or drinks
can fill that void.

853
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,316
That's why I want to say this.

854
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:01,068
Can we continue to contemplate it

855
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:03,112
and look for the answer?

856
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:08,284
For now, let us focus
on the suffering victims.

857
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:11,621
Okay, I will.

858
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:13,706
I'm the one who chose you.

859
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,918
You asked, "Why was it me of all people?"

860
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:21,839
My heart dropped as soon as you said that.
I've been feeling heavy since.

861
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,009
I'm sorry. That wasn't my intention.

862
01:03:25,092 --> 01:03:26,928
But you know, I was also glad.

863
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,473
It felt like you finally…

864
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:33,434
began to open up to me.

865
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:36,604
Was I that reserved?

866
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:38,648
At this point in time,

867
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:41,943
you have me as a captain,
and we have the smart and kind

868
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:43,486
Jung Chu Chu… Goodness.

869
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:46,030
You have Woo-ju too.

870
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:49,200
And Superintendent Baek,
who loves the Analysis Team,

871
01:03:49,283 --> 01:03:50,660
as well as Gil-pyo.

872
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:52,578
Don't keep everything to yourself.

873
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:55,790
If you get mad, scream out.

874
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:58,084
And start swearing too.

875
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:00,253
Do whatever you want. I can deal with it.

876
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:02,630
I'll do that.

877
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:07,009
I'll broaden my search
and look for other cases

878
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:09,053
similar to the Southwestern Case.

879
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:12,014
I do feel bad…

880
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:15,601
for choosing you for this work.

881
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:19,146
But even if I went back in time,
I'd still choose you.

882
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:20,773
Me too.

883
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:26,779
You know how cheesy this is, right?

884
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:28,614
Yes, I do. I know.

885
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:31,576
I'm just saying it over a drink.

886
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:33,536
Woo-ju, do you want another drink too?

887
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:40,293
Goodness.

888
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:41,919
Woo-ju.

889
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:44,672
<i>We're looking for a psycho
who's lurking around</i>

890
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:46,424
<i>the Southwestern area
with a knife in his hand.</i>

891
01:04:46,507 --> 01:04:48,009
<i>He keeps changing his weapon.</i>

892
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:50,595
<i>It's good to be focused on work,
but we're in for a long haul.</i>

893
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:53,723
The more we hesitate and delay it,
the more victims there will be.

894
01:04:53,806 --> 01:04:56,100
The Special Crime Squad
wants to catch the culprit too.

895
01:04:56,183 --> 01:04:58,686
<i>His MO evolved by studying his crimes.</i>

896
01:04:58,769 --> 01:04:59,937
<i>What's next?</i>

897
01:05:00,521 --> 01:05:01,772
-What was that?
-Becoming him.

898
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:03,107
<i>I'm trying to become the culprit.</i>

899
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:04,734
<i>For the first time,</i>

900
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:07,069
<i>I'm starting to wonder
if I made the right choice.</i>
