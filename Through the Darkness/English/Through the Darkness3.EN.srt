<i>Have you heard of it?</i>

7
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,473
<i>No, I've never heard of it.</i>

8
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,724
<i>We had a team like that?</i>

-Hello.
-Who are you?

18
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,648
I'm a statistics analyst
who was transferred here.

19
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,066
My name is Jung Woo-ju.

20
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,609
-Nice to meet you.
-Same here.

21
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,653
-See you later.
-Okay.

22
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:24,811

we filed your child missing.

25
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:33,278
If we hear anything about Soo-hyun,
we will call you right away.

26
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,238
Staying here won't help.

27
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,699
So you should go back home.

28
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:41,703
But it's been over a week already.

29
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,331
You don't think…

30
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,001
-something bad happened to…
-Stop.

31
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,836
Don't say that.

32
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,380
A lot of children her age get lost

33
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,465
and we get calls
from the protection center.

34
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:58,052
So don't worry too much.
Let's give it some time.

35
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,013
-Thank you.
-Sure.

36
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,931
-Bye.
-Bye.

37
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,684
-We'll wait for your call.
-Sure. Bye.

00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,644

39
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:08,813
When is Soo-hyun coming back?

40
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,024
She'll come home soon.

41
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:22,952
Gosh. We're visiting a prison
on a gorgeous day like today?

42
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,287
Should we play hooky today?

43
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,331
Today is our first meeting.

44
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,333
I was just joking.

45
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,918
Don't be so serious.

00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,212

Hey, how come we only have

51
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,868
outdated items in the inventory?

52
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,204
Does this thing even work? Does it?

53
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,289
Goodness. It works.

54
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,749
First of all, don't be nervous.

55
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,340
We'll call you once we're done.

a profiler of

I'm the captain of the team.

I'm Kook Young-soo.

62
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,616
Is this a joke?

63
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:28,828
We are police officers

64
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,039
who study the psychology of criminals.

65
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,373
You're just cops.

66
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,500
Why are you giving me a complicated title?

67
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,169
We came here today

68
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:39,338
because we want to know why
you committed such a crime six years ago.

69
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,757
You barge in here

70
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,885
because you want to know
what happened six years ago?

71
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,261
As I told you,

72
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:47,388
it's to study the psychology of criminals.

73
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,559
What's in it for me?

74
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:53,936
Nothing.

75
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,772
How about some cigarettes?

76
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,482
Let me say this again.

77
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:00,193
-You will not get any benefits.
-Why would I tell you then?

78
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,195
About what happened six years ago,

79
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,739
if I'm not getting anything in return?

80
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,033
We're figuring out
the wrong answers for data.

81
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,665
Haven't heard "wrong answers" in a while.

82
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,087
I used to make my students
write notes for wrong answers.

83
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,841
When you were a teacher
at Bugyeong Primary School?

84
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,385
You know everything.
What else do you want to know?

85
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,429
We have your case file.

86
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:31,182
But we're interested in your thoughts.

87
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:32,475
Right.

88
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,977
We can't find them in your case file.

89
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,023
I thought it would be fun to meet cops.

90
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,108
But it's no fun.

91
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:41,734
Hey! We're done here.

92
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,903
Six years ago, you cut your lover,

93
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,197
Lee Geum-ju, into 23 pieces.

94
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,796
You don't know everything, I guess.

95
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,384
It's 24 pieces.

96
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,222
It says 23 in the case file.

97
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,598
Arms and legs…

98
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:17,395
Cut them off and divide them into two.
How many do you have?

99
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,985
There are nine.

100
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,071
You can't do the math.

101
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,449
Then you cut her neck,
pulled out her eyeballs,

102
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,159
cut her nose, ears, lips into two,

103
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,411
breasts, thumbs, and big toes.

104
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,414
That adds up to 23.

105
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,876
You forgot one.

106
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:02,940
Did you cut off her tongue?

107
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,152
She talked too much.

108
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,528
You see, I…

109
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,906
She was dead, for sure.

110
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,824
But she wouldn't stop talking.

111
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,910
That witch kept on talking,

112
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,621
so I bit it off. Like this.

113
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,625
Then it was better.

114
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,253
Do you have gum? Can I have a piece?

115
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,550
You chewed it off?

116
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,344
Her tongue?

117
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:32,678
Why?

118
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,733
We should wrap this up here today.

119
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,652
I need to use the bathroom.

120
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,445
We'll wait.
It hasn't been ten minutes yet.

121
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,155
You'll come back since you want me.

122
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,034
Let me make the call

123
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,370
so I'd want to talk to you.

124
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:00,456
Don't you prefer this
over being locked up in your cell?

125
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,209
Officer!

126
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:10,591
ESTABLISH LAW AND ORDER

00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:23,854
-Can you unlock the door?
-Oh, sorry.

129
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:33,948
Oh, boy.

130
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,125
Do you go to church?

131
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:47,712
I'm Catholic, but I haven't been
to church for a long time.

132
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,756
Ever since I got this job,

133
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,134
I've been struggling to believe in god.

134
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,887
It's better than believing in humans.

135
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,181
If doomsday were to come,

136
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,935
scumbags like Jang Deuk-ho
would be wiped out, right?

137
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:10,151
SAUNA

138
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,327
I totally forgot about the newbie.

139
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,498
Darn it.

140
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,550
Where's this sound coming from?

00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,141

Jung Woo-ju speaking.

142
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:45,227
My gosh, you're still there?

143
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,147
Who is this?

144
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,358
This is Captain Kook Young-soo.

145
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,651
Yes, Captain.

146
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,444
You should've just gone home.

147
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,530
-You said you wanted to meet with me.
<i>-Gosh, I'm sorry.</i>

148
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,532
I was occupied all day, so I forgot.

149
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,994
Just go home. We'll talk tomorrow.

150
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,246
Okay. I'm sorry.

151
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,084
I totally forgot to look after the newbie.

152
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,877
Hey, wait up.

153
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,672
Goodness. You're always so predictable.

154
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,424
Thank you.

155
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,135
I'm starving. Let's go eat something.

156
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,763
I don't feel like eating.
I'll just head home.

157
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,640
You should still eat something.

158
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,184
Come on.
I don't want to eat alone at home.

159
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,977
Your family must be waiting for you.

160
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,563
You didn't know?
I've been living alone since last year.

161
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:35,236
No, it's not what you're thinking.

162
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,405
My wife and kids are abroad now.

163
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,698
-They're abroad?
-Yes.

164
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,617
I forgot the name,

165
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,412
but a school in Singapore
offered a scholarship,

166
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,871
so I sent them there.

167
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,081
Your kids must be smart.

168
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,083
Yes. They take after my wife.

169
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,585
Oh, boy.

170
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,464
Anyway, this job is always
so unstable, you know.

171
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,883
It seemed like a good chance, so I agreed.

172
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,635
But living alone is awful.

173
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:03,681
Everyone says they're jealous,
but they have no idea.

174
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:06,600
The freedom was nice for a month,
but that was it.

175
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,643
Which restaurant?

176
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,145
Just any restaurant on the way.

177
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,647
I should grab a bite
before the restaurants close.

178
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:19,196
MAY 2000, CHANGEUI-DONG

179
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,124
-Did something happen?
-Yes.

180
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,876
-My gosh.
-What happened?

181
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,545
-What?
-Is it a kid?

182
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,380
-It's a little kid.
-My gosh.

183
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,175
-This is insane.
-Gosh.

184
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,180
My goodness.

185
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,018
-Go on in.
-Yes, sir.

186
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,019
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

187
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,479
Where is Captain Yoon?

188
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,648
She's on the phone
with the chief of Forensics.

189
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:36,565
She'll be here.

190
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,613
Hello.

191
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,075
CHANGEUI-DONG MUTILATION MURDER CASE

192
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,828
INSPECTOR YOON TAE-GU
CAPTAIN OF TEAM 2, SPECIAL CRIME SQUAD 1

193
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,414
I'll start the briefing.

194
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,333
{\an8}TIME OF INCIDENT
LOCATION OF THE BODY FOUND

195
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,961
At around 1:20 p.m. today,

196
00:13:57,044 --> 00:14:00,005
parts of the victim's body were found

197
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,883
<i>by Lee Chun-young,
a 72-year-old junk collector,</i>

198
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,261
<i>in the alleyway at 94 Changeui-dong.</i>

199
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,304
The news spread quickly because of

200
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,889
a reporter who lives in the area,

201
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,766
and it became nationwide news.

202
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:15,020
The case was transferred
to the Special Crime Squad at 5:00 p.m.

203
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:16,855
The rest of the body?

204
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,317
So far, we've only found the limbs
cut up into eight pieces.

205
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,319
They were placed in three plastic bags.

206
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,866
We are thoroughly searching the area
to find the rest of the body.

207
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,325
Have we identified the victim?

208
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:32,746
A five-year-old girl, Lee Soo-hyun,
was reported missing

209
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,000
in Changeui-dong on the 20th,
so we're looking into it now.

210
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:37,751
Goodness.

211
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,589
-This is crazy.
-Search thoroughly!

212
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,092
There is so much junk here. Darn it.

213
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,218
Detective!

214
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:01,233
Soo-hyun… Did you find Soo-hyun?

215
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:05,571
She was found dead in Changeui-dong.

216
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:10,409
Are you sure it's Soo-hyun?

217
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,494
No, that can't be.

218
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,663
-No…
-No way.

219
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,708
-My gosh.
-Are you all right, ma'am?

220
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,631
No! That can't be!

221
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:30,763
It's not Soo-hyun. This can't be true!

222
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,973
Oh, dear…

223
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,864
<i>Early this morning,
the police found a head and a torso,</i>

224
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,075
<i>which are suspected to belong to the child</i>

225
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,826
<i>found dead in Changeui-dong.</i>

226
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,995
<i>They are working on
identifying the victim.</i>

227
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,791

were found cut up into pieces.</i>

228
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:03,420

from the National Forensic Service.</i>

SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY
PRESS ROOM

230
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,217
Can you ask them
for a briefing on the case?

231
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,219
Give us some time, will you?

232
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,144
You're here.

233
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,731
Hey, I know that you're new here,
but you're still a journalist.

234
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,942
You can't stay relaxed
at your desk all day.

235
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,819
I'm not relaxed right now.

236
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,572
Anyone would say you're relaxed right now.

237
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,700
How much longer
will you sit back and watch?

238
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,994
We have to attend
the press forum later today.

239
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,495
That's later.

240
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,455
Pick up your camera and go.

241
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:40,666
Go where?

242
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,961
Anywhere where you can score a big scoop.

243
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,339
Reporter Choi, run.

244
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,799
-Yes, sir.
-Run!

245
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,635
All right, it's time to step up your game!

246
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,095
I'll see you later.

247
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,143
CHANGEUI-DONG DISMEMBERED BODY
MORE BODY PARTS FOUND IN BUMYEONG-DONG

248
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,437
What is this world turning into?

249
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,230
These scumbags…

250
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,990
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

251
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,372
That's my desk.

252
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,627
I'm sorry, sir.
I don't have anywhere to sit.

253
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,923
-You saw the news, right?
-Yes.

254
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,717
-Hello, sir.
-Right.

255
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,510
What was your name again?

256
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:34,553
Jung Woo-ju, sir.

257
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:37,264
I've been assigned to the team
as a statistics analyst.

258
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,558
Nice to meet you.
I'm Captain Kook Young-soo.

259
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,227
This is Inspector Song Ha-young,
our profiler.

260
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,731
The victim is a five-year-old girl.

261
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,650
-Five years old?
-Yes.

262
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,154
Excuse me.

263
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,866
I don't have a desk.

264
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,577
A desk…

265
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,163
-Just let him use this one.
-What about this?

266
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,125
<i>Gil-pyo, you need to let
our team take part in this case.</i>

267
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,212
Where are you? Are you in here?

268
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:11,006
All right. I'll talk to the team.

269
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,674
Gil-pyo, we met Jang Deuk…

270
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,594
We interviewed a mutilation murderer.

271
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,098
You punk.

272
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,683
Hey, do you think this is child's play?

273
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,143
I already have a lot going on.

274
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,478
You think I'm joking?

275
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,230
I said I'll talk to them!

276
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,742
Excuse me.

277
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,411
Where should I put this?

278
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,372
Wherever you want to sit.

279
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,373
Wherever I want to…

280
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,332
Okay.

281
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,793
Where I want to sit.

282
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,716
FOUND EIGHT BODY PIECES OF THE VICTIM,
A YOUNG CHILD

283
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:10,065
-Is your blood type B?
-Yes.

284
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,902
-Was that an insult?
-Sorry?

285
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,323
No, not at all. My blood type is B too.

286
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:19,992
I see.

287
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,286
THE MURDER ENRAGES THE PUBLIC,
POLICE PRESSES CITIZEN'S REPORT

288
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,038
Why did you apply for
the Behavioral Analysis Team?

289
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,456
It looked cool.

290
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,295
Behavioral Analysis Team.

291
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,255
It already sounds cool.

292
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,132
Statistic analyst

293
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:38,093
of the Behavioral Analysis Team
of Detective Division,

294
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,638
Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

295
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,059
Cool.

296
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,104
THE CULPRIT HIDES THE BODY
IN A PLASTIC BAG

297
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,856
POLICE PRESUME THE CULPRIT
IS A MENTAL PATIENT

298
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,150
Do you know the story
of the blind man and a lantern?

299
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,070
-Sorry?
-Someone asked a blind man

300
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:00,324
who was walking down a dark road
with a lantern in his hand.

301
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,452
"You can't see anyway.
Why do you carry that around?"

302
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,915
Why do you think so?

303
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:11,043
Why was he carrying that?

304
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,005
He wanted others to see clearly

305
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,216
and not fall down while walking.

306
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,304
He lit up the road for others,
not for himself.

307
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,977
It's tough to last
unless you have this attitude

308
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,605
when you start a career
in coming across criminals.

309
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,400
I see.

310
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:45,077
You stashed us in storage
as if we got demoted.

311
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,453
And we only have two men.

312
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,830
No, we only now have one more.

313
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,415
We're not even a real team.

314
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,458
What is this?

315
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,293
Special Crime Squad is very busy.

316
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,920
We don't even have time to smoke.

317
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,838
You know what it's like. Cut it out.

318
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,966
We aren't some hecklers.

319
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,260
We're trying to help out
with the investigation.

320
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,637
I know, but it's still too early.

321
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,097
You know people don't know

322
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,975
what exactly
the Behavioral Analysis Team does.

323
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,726
Of course.

324
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,812
You stashed us in some shabby storage.

325
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:13,730
We didn't have the budget and the staff,

326
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,400
but you insisted on
making the team in haste.

327
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,819
That was the only room available.

328
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,113
We report to the Detective Division.

329
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,739
I'm telling Superintendent Baek.

330
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,074
Wait. Stop right there.

331
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,786
Report or whatever,
you aren't the chief anymore.

332
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,997
You have to go through me.

333
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,707
I know we're close,

334
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,917
but let's not destroy the reporting lines.

335
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,919
-What do you expect, then?
-One second.

336
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,006
My phone smells weird.

337
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,633
-Why?
-I think something is served.

338
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,427
You got served.

339
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,932
You wouldn't listen to me
when I tried to stop you!

340
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:52,185
Hey, others are dying
to climb up the ladder.

341
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,854
No one told you to get demoted.

342
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,772
It's because this job is that important.

343
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,065
Whatever.

344
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,026
I'm going directly to the captain.

345
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,111
Hey, wait. Get back here.

346
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,532
Stay conscious of the men above
and continue to interview inmates.

347
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:10,203
Then at least share the daily report
of the investigation with us.

348
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:13,248
-How can I share that as I like?
-What can you share, then?

349
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,333
My love for you.

350
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,668
I can always share that.

351
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,128
Good grief.

352
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,921
I'm ordering <i>jjajangmyeon</i>. Want some?

353
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,006
No.

354
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,468
<i>The police noted
there were no calls from the culprit</i>

355
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:27,137
<i>to demand money
from the family of the victim.</i>

356
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,597
<i>Thus, a mentally ill person.</i>

357
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,390
<i>-Might be the killer.</i>
-What happened?

358
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,393
They won't even share the reports?

359
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,895
I'm going to meet the captain.

360
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,563
Who's the captain of Team 2 again?

361
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,606
Captain Yoon Tae-gu.

362
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,358
Have you worked together?

363
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,819
For a short while,
at Jungbu Station. I'll come too.

364
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,279
Sounds great. Come with me.

365
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,494
SPECIAL CRIME SQUAD 1

366
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:53,747
Captain.

367
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,421
They walked out of
Chief Heo's office just now.

368
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,256
They want us to share the case reports.

369
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,593
Make sure they don't freeload on our case.

370
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,762
I'll manage.

371
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,101
Nice to meet you.

372
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,188
How may I help you?

373
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,483
My name is Kook Young-soo.
I used to be in Forensics.

374
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,987
Chief Kook Young-soo of Forensics.

375
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,866
You made a name for yourself,
so I know who you are.

376
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,369
-Thank you.
-It has been a while.

377
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:34,830
Yes.

378
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,044
"Criminal behavioral analyst"?

379
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,213
We study the minds of criminals.

380
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,258
I meet with inmates in prison,
conduct interviews,

381
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,968
and turn that info into data.

382
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,219
What do you do with them?

383
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,180
Do you run psychological tests?

384
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,855
It was a joke.
I'm sorry if you were offended.

385
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,106
No, it's all right.

386
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,025
Not many know about our team,
so I understand.

387
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,318
Why don't we grab a seat?

388
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,696
I'm a little busy right now.

389
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,322
I see. Okay.

390
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,783
We interviewed a mutilation murderer.

391
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,704
If we find out
the psychology of the criminal,

392
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,539
we can prevent another crime.

393
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:21,376
We are in a rush to resolve the case
instead of preventing it.

394
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:22,794
I understand. It's true, but…

395
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,755
Instead of arresting culprits,
the Behavioral Analysis Team aims

396
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,257
to prevent similar crimes--

397
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,843
Even if all of us end up unemployed,

398
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,721
it would be wonderful
to see a day like that.

399
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,014
Isn't that so?

400
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,477
We'd like to help with this investigation.

401
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,940
The detectives in charge
are more than competent.

402
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,193
I doubt it was done
by a mentally ill person.

403
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:49,821
You're stepping over the line.

404
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,114
Why are you so defensive?

405
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:57,954
Goodness, why are you two going on
with different topics?

406
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:02,500
Captain Yoon, we came to see you today
to help out with the investigation.

407
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,461
Please don't take it the wrong way.

408
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:06,296
We are the ones to decide

409
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,216
if you will be helpful or not.

410
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,677
As you can see, we are unbelievably busy

411
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:16,264
because we don't even have a suspect
for that darned mutilation murderer.

412
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:19,100
So we do not have
enough resources to cooperate

413
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:22,312
with your great plan
of criminal analysis or whatnot.

414
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:23,605
In that case,

415
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:27,484
could you please share
the investigation reports?

416
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,194
I know you already know the answer.

417
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,738
I'm sorry to say
that there's nothing I can share.

418
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:34,658
We just want to help you find
a suspect for the case.

419
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,451
As you know, I'm very busy.

420
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,664
May I be excused?

421
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,290
Yes, well, in that case…

422
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,043
INSPECTOR SONG HA-YOUNG

423
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:50,048
Goodness. Let's leave for now.

424
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,758
We'll find a way.

425
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:54,052
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come along.

426
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,387
That's irrelevant.

427
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,977
Statistics Analyst Jung Woo-ju.

428
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,520
-Yes, sir.
-I have a job for you.

429
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,690
Among the articles published
on the Changeui-dong case,

430
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,067
put together everything
that can be used as a lead.

431
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,860
The Changeui-dong case?

432
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,239
The mutilated five-year-old girl.

433
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:20,745
And instead of using that horrible name,

434
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,539
we'll call it the Changeui-dong case.

435
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:23,832
Yes, sir.

436
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,628
Hey, In-tak.

437
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:32,382
Hey, Young-soo. Thanks.

438
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,344
Why did you suddenly want to meet here?

439
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,595
Is something going on?

440
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,683
You know I transferred to
the Behavioral Analysis Team, right?

441
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,936
I heard about it,
but what do you do there?

442
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:48,398
People were talking
and saying you were demoted.

443
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,608
You won't understand even if I explain.

444
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,694
Anyway, I wanted to ask you today

445
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:57,157
if you've found any leads
for the Changeui-dong case.

446
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,326
Which one? The mutilated five-year-old?

447
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,870
-Yes.
-Why are you asking me?

448
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,373
It's a complicated story.

449
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,335
So you really weren't demoted?

450
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,627
Hey, you punk.

451
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,047
Am I someone who would get demoted?

452
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,674
No way,
you are the godfather of Forensics.

453
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,092
You should be promoted.

454
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,093
Exactly.

455
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:21,806
You found nothing at the scene
or on her body?

456
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:25,727
Nothing. The killer even cut up
the kid's fingers.

457
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,228
Fingers?

458
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:32,192
I find these cases horrifying
no matter how many times I see them.

459
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,902
I can never get used to this.

460
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:36,154
The killer put it in a plastic bag,

461
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,073
put it in a backpack, then threw it out?

462
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,243
When the parts were found,
they were frozen.

463
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:45,413
I don't know how the culprit cut her,
but the section looked neat.

464
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,334
Let me borrow your pen.

465
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:53,004
The body was cut after it was frozen.

466
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,631
The cross-section is neatly cut.

467
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,801
Where did she go missing
and when was she abducted?

468
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:58,885
The time?

469
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,595
By any chance,

470
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:02,514
do you think I can look at the photos?

471
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,642
I have them in my office.

472
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,228
But I can't share them.

473
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:09,687
I'll just look at them.

474
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,118
-Be on the lookout for me.
-Okay.

475
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:31,126
What? What are you doing?

476
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,254
Hey, you know that you became the chief

477
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:37,799
because I transferred even though
people were pointing fingers at me.

478
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,676
Yes, I do.

479
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,053
Give me a second. Come on.

480
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:44,723
Keep watching.

481
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:54,941
Thanks.

482
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,238
<i>Arms and legs…</i>

483
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,115
<i>Cut them off and divide them into two.</i>

484
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,700
<i>How many do you have?</i>

485
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,717
If the culprit severed the body parts
not to get caught,

486
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,304
why would the culprit
abandon the body parts nearby?

487
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,556
You're talking to me, right?

488
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,143
I'm going out.

489
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:32,771
I'll be late. If Captain Kook
doesn't come back, go home.

490
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:33,772
Okay.

491
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:42,655
Well,

492
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,116
I have a situation.

493
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,743
I see. Okay.

494
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:48,703
You sure have a difficult job.

495
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,164
-How much is it?
-It's 5,000 won.

496
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:52,332
-Here.
-Thanks.

497
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:07,388
{\an8}HANKUK UNIVERSITY
COMMUNICATION SCIENCE FORUM

498
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,140
-Want some coffee?
-Sounds good.

499
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,309
-It's over there.
-Ki-ho.

500
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,020
Ki-ho.

501
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,193
It's been a while.

502
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,070
You too.

503
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,197
What a surprise.

504
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:28,076
Im Moo-sik of Daehan Daily
is actually saying hello to me first.

505
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,828
Don't be so harsh on me.

506
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,287
I know how to show my respect.

507
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,997
No, you don't.

508
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,918
Well, it's nice to see you guys

509
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,671
working together like this.

510
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,131
Fact Today. Good luck.

511
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,008
Good luck.

512
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:50,265
I don't expect much.
But let's do better than him.

513
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,392
-Yes, sir.
-You're not

514
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,520
going to the office now. Right?

515
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,648
Oh, I…

516
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,072
Hello?

517
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:08,741
You know that
I rarely call in favors. Right?

518
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:11,786
But I know when you start with that,
you're asking a favor.

519
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,496
What is it this time?

520
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,540
If you know anything, give me some intel.

521
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,625
Come on. Don't ask me that. Bye.

522
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,211
<i>Hey, don't hang up.</i>

523
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:23,172
I really need to find a lead.
Can you help me out here?

524
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:30,013
Gosh. Why did he just hang up on me?

525
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,154
See?

526
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:49,532
The desperate ones
are bound to take initiative.

527
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,036
Do you feel like talking to me now?

528
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,662
No. Not yet.

529
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,165
Turn that off.

530
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,220
-Happy now?
-A bit.

531
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,056
Don't you feel guilty?

532
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,933
You brutally killed a woman.

533
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,601
She was already dead anyway.

534
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,227
Nothing I can do.

535
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,439
What's the point of holding on

536
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,191
to the past and regretting it?

537
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,570
It's not regretting. It's repenting.

538
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:30,907
Do you know something?

539
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,451
Your eyes

540
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,329
seem so familiar.

541
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,251
There's a void

542
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,587
in your eyes.

543
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,674
-Stop making useless comments.
-I'm serious.

544
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:52,011
Fine. I'm human, after all.

545
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,306
I do feel guilty from time to time.

546
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:05,525
Right.

547
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:11,781
You can also…

548
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:15,910
turn into a monster
if the situation allows.

549
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,622
-So I'm just one step away?
-Yes.

550
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,250
You can't consider guilt
the same as murder.

551
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:30,133
That's the difference between
humans and monsters like you.

552
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,510
You think heinous crimes
are the same as morality.

553
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:33,678
It's a horrendous thought.

554
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,431
A horrendous thought?

555
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,272
Do you know what's really horrid?

556
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,485
Severing the body.

557
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,624
Then why did you do it?

558
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:08,046
Do you think I did it for fun?

559
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,965
It takes a lot of time and is exhausting.

560
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:13,968
Think about it.

561
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,387
Where could I go
while carrying a body that big?

562
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,973
Where could I hide her?

563
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,685
Cutting her up wasn't easy.

564
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:23,978
That bitch.

565
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:29,108
So you cut her up to move her easily?

566
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,487
If that was the only reason,

567
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:35,406
you wouldn't have removed
her eyes and tongue.

568
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:38,493
You got half right.

569
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,952
The other half is wrong.

570
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,581
You get 50 points.

571
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:09,023
<i>There's a void in your eyes.</i>

572
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,233
<i>You can also…</i>

573
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:14,362
<i>turn into a monster
if the situation allows.</i>

574
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,459
I'm back.

575
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,545
Where did you go?

576
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,797
-I went to meet Jang Deuk-ho.
-I see.

577
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,008
How did you get them?

578
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,301
From my connection.

579
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,512
Wait.

580
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:45,726
-You're missing the time and locations.
-Right. I got it.

581
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,781
-Did you eat?
-I don't have an appetite.

582
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,908
You still have to eat.

583
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,788
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

584
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,665
Hey, give me that.

585
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:10,042
Gosh. I'm so tired.

586
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,378
-You're back.
-Yes.

587
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:15,006
Did anyone hold grudges
against her parents?

588
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,634
We haven't found anyone so far.
We still have to look further.

589
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:21,220
This is the file from Forensics.
I checked them by time.

590
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,849
Did you eat?

591
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:27,226
-What time does the sauna open?
-It should be open.

592
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,603
There was no ransom.

593
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,188
The culprit wasn't after money.

594
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,690
Given its brutality,
we can look into those

595
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:34,442
who may hold grudges against her parents.

596
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,028
But the Special Crime Squad
hasn't found anyone yet.

597
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:39,614
That's why they think
the killer is mentally ill.

598
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,950
But the body was cut too neatly
for someone who's mentally unstable.

599
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,453
The culprit cut her up by her joints.

600
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,666
It means that the culprit knew the method.

601
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,336
And each body part
was put in different plastic bags.

602
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,254
Just looking at the evidence,

603
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,800
the killer must've had a job
involving cutting.

604
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,594
What kind of job would that be?

605
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:05,223
This is going back to square one,

606
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,516
but why was it discarded in the area?

607
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,726
It's easier to find.

608
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,021
Maybe the culprit didn't have the means
to move them elsewhere.

609
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,195
But these were double-bagged, right?

610
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,073
Yes, you're right.

611
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,867
Why double-bag them?

612
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,622
Maybe a butcher?

613
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,460
That's possible.

614
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:35,878
A butcher.

615
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:36,963
A BUTCHER

616
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,257
It's possible the culprit used
a cutting machine.

617
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,051
And the way the body parts
were frozen too.

618
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,511
But would a butcher

619
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,138
put the body parts neatly in plastic bags?

620
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:49,058
Then maybe it's someone
who works at a butcher shop.

621
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:50,518
Oh, that's right.

622
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,312
When you buy meat,
they double-bag it in black plastic bags.

623
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,772
Fish too.

624
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:57,441
Judging by the way they were cut,
I'd say a butcher,

625
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,110
not someone who handles fish.

626
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,570
But don't butchers have to work
during the day?

627
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:04,282
Business owners
can set their own work schedules.

628
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,324
Or…

629
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,910
someone who used to have that kind of job.

630
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,662
Or someone who's currently unemployed.

631
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:14,292
UNEMPLOYED

632
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,504
And they said the killer would
be someone with a mental illness.

633
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:22,174
-But if it's a mentally unstable person…
-I'm not sure.

634
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,301
It's highly unlikely.

635
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:27,471
Because people like that
can't really plan a crime like this.

636
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,849
Looking at how they were cut,
it has to be someone

637
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:31,434
who is skilled at cutting things.

638
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:34,687
Exactly. That's how we should
approach this. We should…

639
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,896
COME AGAIN BUTCHERS

640
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,440
Excuse me. Good day, sir.

641
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:40,276
We're from the Special Crime Squad
at Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

642
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:44,905
We'd like to ask you a few questions
regarding the recent incidents.

643
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,074
Did you take some time off recently?

644
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,659
Is the owner not here?

645
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,744
He stepped out.

646
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:50,911
-He did?
-Yes.

647
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,915
<i>We're from the Special Crime Squad

648
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,543
<i>We'd like to ask you a few questions.</i>

649
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:58,753
<i>On May 25,</i>

650
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,464
did any of your employees miss work or…

651
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:05,551
<i>Think about it.</i>

652
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:09,138
<i>Where could I go
while carrying a body that big?</i>

653
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:10,723
<i>Where could I hide her?</i>

654
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:14,685
<i>Il-young.</i>

655
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,772
<i>Can you check the ex-cons'
mental illness history?</i>

656
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:24,487
SEONGDONG MENTAL HOSPITAL

657
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:28,783
SPECIAL CRIME SQUAD 1
TEAM 2

658
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:30,951
Captain Yoon.

659
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:33,204
Can you spare me a moment?

660
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:40,336
It's not like you don't know the protocol.

661
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,254
Do you think we're a complete joke?

662
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:45,758
Or is it me you have no respect for?

663
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:48,636
What I'm saying is
that the culprit is not mentally unstable.

664
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,889
You're crossing the line again.

665
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:53,724
Captain Yoon.

666
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,729
Sorry.

667
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,857
You said you wanted to help, right?

668
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,692
-I'm trying to help you.
-No.

669
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:06,987
You're here to meddle in our work,
not help us.

670
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,282
We're doing just fine,

671
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:12,493
so mind your own business.

672
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:15,204
We've already checked
all the butcher shops in the area.

673
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,914
You're not the only one

674
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:19,250
who is keeping a close watch on this case.

675
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:22,711
It may just be an intriguing case
to you and your team,

676
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:24,713
but my team has a duty to solve it.

677
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:29,093
You have been interviewing
some offenders in jail.

678
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,471
Shouldn't you be interviewing
more of them right now?

679
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:36,308
I'm sure you quit the Serious Crime Unit
and accepted this new position

680
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,060
for a reason.

681
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:40,020
I don't know what it is,

682
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,773
but you should work hard
to prevent future crimes.

683
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,820
I don't appreciate your tone.

684
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,699
We aren't doing this
just because it's intriguing.

685
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,828
How could you misunderstand
your fellow officers like this?

686
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,165
Do you have a problem with my team?

687
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,460
Or is it me?

688
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:03,961
You sure have a knack

689
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,297
for overstepping your boundaries.

690
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:09,717
Let me make this clear to you.

691
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,220
I am the lead investigator on this case.

692
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:17,308
Do not underestimate or doubt
what the Special Crime Squad can do.

693
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,143
If you truly want to help us,

694
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:23,063
do what you have to do
in your own position.

695
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:43,167
Captain Yoon.

696
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:53,052
28 DAYS AFTER THE INCIDENT
JUNE 26, 2000

697
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,637
Hey, Lotte won yesterday.

698
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,432
My gosh.

699
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:02,895
-Oh, dear. It's so hot, isn't it?
-Yes.

700
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:06,607
We can't use the AC before July.

701
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,650
Chief Heo.

702
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:10,819
Can you please brief us on the progress?

703
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,279
Do you have a suspect yet?

704
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,198
I'll let you know when there's progress.

705
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:18,035
What? All eyes are on this case now.

706
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:20,412
Are you saying
there still has been no progress?

707
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,413
Come on.

708
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:24,750
You know that
we're all busting our butts now.

709
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,879
Well, everything is classified
except for the info

710
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,381
shared with the public,

711
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:33,008
so we cannot share anything else.
Please understand.

712
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:35,844
Please refer to what I said when writing.
I have to go.

713
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,596
-Come on!
-Tell us what's going on!

714
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,432
-Don't do this to us!
-This is crazy!

715
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,110
Captain Yoon Tae-gu.

716
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,323
Did you stay up all night?

717
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:58,826
What brings you here?

718
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,953
I transferred to
the Intelligence Unit here

719
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:01,996
two weeks ago.

720
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,248
Really?

721
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:07,543
-You must be very busy these days.
-Yes, as always.

722
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:12,131
How can we chat and share information

723
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:13,882
with someone who doesn't smoke?

724
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,884
She's no fun.

725
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,428
She's difficult to work with.

726
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:18,596
Goodness.

727
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:20,806
They say women are chatty,

728
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:22,725
but men are worse in my opinion.

729
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,770
Is there any progress
with the investigation?

730
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,148
Well, it's not easy.

731
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:31,442
Because you're in charge
of the murder case

732
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:32,401
in Changeui-dong,

733
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:35,029
losers like them are watching you
with their eyes peeled.

734
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,530
Really?

735
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,533
Everyone in the police force
knows that you're a star player.

736
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,619
But there are still losers
who complain about

737
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,203
a woman leading them.

738
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:47,333
Losers. They're so pathetic.

739
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,668
I'm so happy that you're here.

740
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,421
-Take it easy.
-You too.

741
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,258
Come, over here!

742
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,637
<i>A butcher.</i>

743
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:03,265
<i>The victim went missing at a park
during the day,</i>

744
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,934
<i>and the body parts were found nearby.</i>

745
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,519
MISSING, LEE SOO-HYUN, AGE 5

746
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,438
<i>It means the culprit lives in the area.</i>

747
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:13,067
<i>And it has to be someone
who doesn't have a set schedule.</i>

748
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,278
<i>What kind of trait does the culprit have?</i>

749
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:19,657
<i>Why did the killer kidnap her?</i>

750
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,327
<i>Why did the killer dismember her body?</i>

751
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:27,706
<i>The body parts were found
in black plastic bags.</i>

752
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,042
<i>They were double-bagged.</i>

753
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,505
<i>Who is the culprit?</i>

754
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:38,384
<i>I must find the culprit
who killed a five-year-old kid.</i>

755
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,427
MISSING, LEE SOO-HYUN, AGE 5

756
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,853
<i>Why was it her?</i>

757
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:54,149
-Come here!
-Hey!

758
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:56,151
Hey, wait up!

759
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,528
<i>Where is the culprit hiding?</i>

760
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:07,121
Hello?

761
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:09,456
<i>Captain, to the autopsy room. Hurry.</i>

762
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,001
A fridge?

763
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,462
The body was frozen, remember?

764
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,132
The marks on the back
seem to be from the freezer shelves.

765
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,515
Captain Kook Young-soo found it.

766
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:37,985
What is it about, sir?

767
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,570
Why can't you just say it?

768
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:44,366
I know what everyone thinks
about the Behavioral Analysis Team.

769
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,993
I know what's going on,

770
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:51,290
but we can give them a chance, you know?

771
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,251
Kook Young-soo was the one
who found the clue.

772
00:45:57,504 --> 00:45:59,673
Captain Yoon, I'm sure you know this,

773
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:02,759
but it's lonely taking a path
no one has ever taken before.

774
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:04,511
They're probably lonely.

775
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:09,516
So I'd like you to help them.

776
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:14,938
Don't get me wrong. It's not an order.

777
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:18,108
Of course not. I'm sure she knows.

778
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,738
Yes, sir. I should get back to work.

779
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:24,364
-Okay, sure.
-All right.

780
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:35,083
EVIDENCE PHOTOS

781
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:37,377
We'll check the junk shops
in the area first.

782
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:41,173
Then we'll check
electronics stores in the area.

783
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,133
Please check thoroughly.

784
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,177
Will do. Good luck.

785
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:49,890
-Let's go.
-Yes, ma'am.

786
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:54,061
USED FURNITURE
HOME AND OFFICE ELECTRONICS

787
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:04,738
Hello?

788
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:08,700
Are there refrigerators with shelves
that are spaced out like that?

789
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,285
Or did you maybe sell one?

790
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,579
Please look at the distance
between the shelves.

791
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:26,802
Goodness.

792
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:30,889
LEE MARKET

793
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,600
Excuse me, sir.

794
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,787
Give this person a visit.

795
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,372
-Thank you.
-No problem.

796
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:56,623
-Thank you.
-Sure.

797
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,509
{\an8}WOOSUNG JUNK

798
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:12,598
Don't do it yourself. Let me help you.

799
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,350
Excuse me, sir?

800
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:19,771
Hello.

801
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,024
-Hi.
-Are you the owner?

802
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:24,192
Yes, I am. What brings you here?

803
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:26,695
We're from
the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

804
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:29,156
I see. What brings you here then?

805
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,741
We wanted to ask you a question.

806
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:34,494
This is my go-to song.

807
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:37,581
Would you mind turning it off
for a moment, please?

808
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:38,707
Sure.

809
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,001
Thank you.

810
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:45,047
The thing is, we're looking for
a particular model for a fridge

811
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,007
and heard you're an expert on fridges.

812
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:50,177
Nobody can beat me when it comes to
knowledge about fridges in Korea.

813
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:54,139
-I see.
-Could you tell us what model this is?

814
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:56,433
Let me see.

815
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:58,685
The model seems like a pretty old one.

816
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,187
Hold on.

817
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:10,322
RESTRICTED AREA

818
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,535
Let's see here.

819
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:20,832
Yes, this one.

820
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:24,336
This was a model produced in 1988.

821
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,048
That's not a shelf,
it's the interior floor of the fridge.

822
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:31,259
They probably only have this
at the Daesung headquarters.

823
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:35,138
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

824
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,264
No problem.

825
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,850
Captain Yoon? We found the model.

826
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,811
A report on
the remaining body parts came in.

827
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:42,771
We're headed there now.

828
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,024
Where is it?

829
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:54,366
Detective Nam?

830
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:56,368
Speed up a little more, Il-young.

831
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,203
Let's catch up quickly!

832
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:09,756
GYEONGSEONG-DONG,
GYEONGGI PROVINCE, GWANGJU

833
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,050
DAWONJANG MOTEL

834
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:24,354
This has never happened
in my 20 years of running a motel.

835
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,398
I looked in because
I heard something break

836
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:29,317
and saw the toilet was clogged
with a heavy-looking object.

837
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:31,236
Police.

838
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:34,573
I thought it was
a piece of meat thrown out.

839
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:36,992
I took it out without giving it
a second thought.

840
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:39,578
You have no idea how startled I was.

841
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:42,539
My heart is still racing, young lady.

842
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:47,544
Yes, Director.

843
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:49,921
All the higher-ups came too.

844
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:50,922
There's no doubt.

845
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,925
I'm telling you,
you can trust my informant.

846
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,427
I'm still the only one here.

847
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,513
I'm finally getting an exclusive report.

848
00:50:58,597 --> 00:50:59,973
You're interfering
with official police duty.

849
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:01,725
-What the heck?
-Stop her.

850
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:03,059
There's no exclusive here.

851
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,561
What nonsense are you saying?

852
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:07,355
Let me…

853
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:11,151
-Why are you taking it? It's mine!
-Ma'am.

854
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,362
Why are you here?
The higher-ups are going to get mad.

855
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:16,406
-You came too, Superintendent Baek.
-Hey.

856
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,450
We found the model of the fridge.

857
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:19,534
-What is it?
-You did?

858
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,453
-Excuse me.
-Okay.

859
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,080
Is that him? The stubborn one?

860
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:26,583
Yes. Let's talk later.

861
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:30,045
Hey. What about us? Young-soo!

862
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:36,176
You found the model of the fridge?

863
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:37,469
Yes, we did.

864
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:39,805
It's a Daesung fridge,
manufactured in 1988.

865
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:40,806
This is the model.

866
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:45,060
Hey, I still have a business to run.

867
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:47,312
How much longer will this take,
young lady?

868
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:49,439
She's not "young lady." She's a detective.

869
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,441
She's the captain in charge of this case.

870
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,443
Please just wrap it up quickly.

871
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,403
I'll have to call a shaman for cleansing.

872
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:02,828
Is it okay if we go in now?

873
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:05,455
Don't come in here
to step on and touch things.

874
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:08,500
The best way for the two of you to help
is to stay right there.

875
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,381
Thank you for the hard work.

876
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:17,384
Someone with experience needs to help out.

877
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:18,385
Young-soo.

878
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:20,929
This is strange, right?

879
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:33,066
He didn't come here to sleep.

880
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:57,048
What is this?

881
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,849
On Monday, May 29,

882
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:08,602
a five-year-old, Lee Soo-hyun,
was dismembered

883
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:10,729
and parts of her body were found

884
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:13,231
in a residential area in Changeui-dong.

885
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,318
Yesterday, on June 26,

886
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:20,447
an additional part of her body was found
at a motel in Gyeongseong-dong.

887
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:24,534
Ms. Kim, the owner of the motel,

888
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:27,203
reported it to the police

889
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:30,165
when she found a part
of a young child's remains

890
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:32,709
in the toilet of room 302
on the third floor around 3 p.m.

891
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:35,170
According to Kim,

892
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:37,923
a man who looked to be in his forties,

893
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:40,759
dressed in manual labor clothes,

894
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:43,803
<i>stayed in this room
around 7 a.m. on the 25th.</i>

895
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,056
<i>We will share the details</i>

896
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:49,351
<i>of this ongoing investigation
with the citizens.</i>

897
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:51,478
<i>We will do our very best
in this investigation</i>

898
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:55,023
<i>and make sure to catch the culprit.</i>

899
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:57,275
<i>I will end the briefing here.</i>

900
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:08,870
OUR PLEDGE

901
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:12,332
<i>We got our first-ever witness,</i>

902
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,543
{\an8}<i>but it didn't lead
to the arrest of the culprit.</i>

903
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:24,177
<i>The identity of the culprit</i>

904
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,429
<i>has become hazier.</i>

905
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:38,650
-There you are.
-Hi.

906
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:41,361
We need more support staff
for the Investigation Team.

907
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:45,323
We're already maxed out.
You know that too.

908
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:48,368
It's already been a week
since the additional body part was found.

909
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,245
We can't delay any further.

910
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:53,039
We don't even have enough
to send out for questioning.

911
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:56,835
Try using the Behavioral Analysis Team.

912
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:59,713
-Chief…
-You said it's urgent.

913
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:02,799
Try asking for their help.

914
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:05,552
Even though their method
may seem unfamiliar,

915
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:09,139
the team was still made
to work for the organization too.

916
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:11,182
They're also
part of the Detective Division.

917
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:15,729
Also, this is off the record

918
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:20,150
but the Behavioral Analysis Team
may go away after this year.

919
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:21,776
What do you mean?

920
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:25,447
They will have to show results,
in order to prove their worth.

921
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:29,034
Those guys are just as involved
as we are in this case.

922
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:31,119
So try utilizing them well.

923
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:33,788
I'm certain it'll be helpful
for both sides.

924
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:43,006
<i>The act of the culprit
leaving the mutilated corpse</i>

925
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:45,717
<i>in a residential area was to show off.</i>

926
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,178
<i>The method of the murder
was so violent and advanced.</i>

927
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:50,847
<i>It's been over a month
since Soo-hyun disappeared.</i>

928
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,766
<i>Yet, the whereabouts of the culprit is…</i>

929
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:58,480
<i>A profiler is
a psychologist-like police officer,</i>

930
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:00,148
<i>not a police officer-like psychologist.</i>

931
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:01,524
BODY PARTS FOUND

932
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,234
<i>A profiler must detect</i>

933
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:06,112
<i>what happened at the crime scene.</i>

934
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:11,367
There's no meaning in keeping
the meeting materials within the team.

935
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:15,288
Why don't we write up a report
and share it with the Investigation Team?

936
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:18,583
So you want to put together
the reasons for our reasoning

937
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:20,668
and suggest it to them as a possibility?

938
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:22,378
Yes.

939
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,589
There's no meaning in doing this
by ourselves.

940
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:26,966
I'm not sure if she'll be convinced.

941
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:29,302
We'll have to try.

942
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:31,429
Shall we?

943
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,893
<i>Profiling Report, Changeui-dong Case.</i>

944
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,646
<i>The dismemberment of a frozen body.</i>

945
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:41,773
<i>A mid to large-sized fridge for home
was used.</i>

946
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:43,608
<i>The cross-section of the body parts.</i>

947
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:45,610
<i>The shape and the cross-section show</i>

948
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:48,071
<i>the culprit is someone
who cuts frozen food.</i>

949
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:50,907
<i>All seven black plastic bags
containing the parts were clean.</i>

950
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,826
<i>Two bags were used to pack the body parts.</i>

951
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:58,957
<i>When people sell frozen products,
they have a habit of wrapping them</i>

952
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,125
<i>in two plastic bags.</i>

953
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:03,044
<i>The culprit likely has a history
of selling frozen food</i>

954
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:07,757
{\an8}<i>or is currently working
at a butcher's shop or at a fish shop.</i>

955
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:09,801
<i>The time it took for dismemberment.</i>

956
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:13,179
The killer took time to cut her body.

957
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:16,349
If the body was cut after it was frozen,

958
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,601
the killer spent a lot of time
on dismemberment.

959
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:22,272
{\an8}The culprit either lives alone

960
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,441
{\an8}or works alone.

961
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,570
{\an8}It would've been too dangerous
to travel far with a little child.

962
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:30,488
<i>In conclusion,</i>

963
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:32,407
<i>the culprit is a man who lives alone,</i>

964
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:34,409
<i>but someone who likes
to keep things clean.</i>

965
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,495
<i>If you search his house,
it will be neatly organized.</i>

966
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:40,874
<i>The weapon he used
will also have been put away neatly.</i>

967
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,208
{\an8}<i>The crime site and his home</i>

968
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,294
{\an8}<i>may be within walking distance</i>

969
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:46,629
{\an8}<i>between the point she went missing
and the victim's home.</i>

970
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:49,299
{\an8}<i>Abduction, sexual molestation, mutilation,</i>

971
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:52,552
{\an8}<i>and abandonment show
the culprit's age is between</i>

972
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:54,220
{\an8}<i>mid-to-late-thirties to early-forties.</i>

973
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,723
{\an8}<i>His final education is presumed</i>

974
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,933
{\an8}<i>as a dropout or a middle school graduate.</i>

975
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:01,936
<i>It may be a person who has
experience in selling frozen food</i>

976
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:05,106
<i>such as a butcher, or a person
who does cutting-related work,</i>

977
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:08,067
<i>he quits his job often
and changes jobs frequently.</i>

978
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,445
<i>He may run a butcher shop,
a raw fish restaurant,</i>

979
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:12,238
<i>or another restaurant alone.</i>

980
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:16,451
"If someone abducted a minor
for sexual purposes,

981
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:18,661
he may show characteristics that are

982
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:20,580
common to child rapists and murderers.

983
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:22,457
He may be an introvert, be reserved,

984
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:26,503
and have a sexual complex."

985
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:29,047
"Premature ejaculation or impotence…"

986
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,798
How are we going to confirm that?

987
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:33,343
So in summary,

988
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:35,970
a man with a sexual complex

989
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:39,807
who lives alone and likes things neat
is probably the culprit. Yes?

990
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:42,810
-Yes, sir.
-What is this nonsense?

991
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:44,521
The victim was abducted at a place

992
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:47,232
difficult to find for those
who aren't familiar with the area.

993
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:49,776
It probably wasn't easy
to take the victim far away

994
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,736
as she cried and fought back.

995
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:54,405
These two things tell us that

996
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:58,826
the crime site and his residence
are most likely within walking distance.

997
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:03,456
He's most likely to reside
somewhere in that area.

998
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,834
We already searched
through the entire neighborhood.

999
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,087
We didn't find anything suspicious.

1000
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:12,799
The same goes for the butcher shop.
We already investigated.

1001
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:16,427
Yes, we did not just sit around.

1002
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:18,888
Then he must've worked there in the past.

1003
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,640
Or someone who quits

1004
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:22,559
and changes jobs frequently.

1005
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:23,977
If that's your theory,

1006
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:27,230
is it possible
that the culprit could be someone

1007
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:29,607
who takes night shifts
at a raw fish restaurant?

1008
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:31,067
It's very likely.

1009
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:33,945
This sounds too vague.

1010
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:35,321
Look at this in the middle.

1011
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:36,948
"Abduction, sexual molestation,

1012
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:39,325
mutilation, and abandonment show

1013
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:42,120
the age is between
mid-to-late-thirties to early-forties."

1014
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:43,955
"His final education is presumed

1015
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:46,082
as a dropout or a middle school graduate."

1016
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:47,250
"If he has a record,

1017
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:48,876
it's most likely for theft

1018
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,004
rather than violence against a person,

1019
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:54,591
then became punished
when he was in middle and high school."

1020
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:58,845
I mean, what's your ground?

1021
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:02,056
Our ground is the FBI's crime analysis…

1022
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,434
Goodness, you're bringing up
those Americans again.

1023
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:06,894
Hey, you're in Korea,

1024
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:10,356
where the World Cup will be held
in just two years.

1025
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:14,569
Also, he threw out
the body parts he cut up

1026
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:16,613
around the neighborhood so proudly,

1027
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,948
yet you're saying
he's not a smart criminal?

1028
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,158
It may look like that,

1029
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:22,368
but the biggest reason he cut her body was

1030
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,203
so no one would find her.

1031
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:27,832
Also, the culprit threw those out
in many different areas.

1032
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:30,126
It's almost like that
personality type test.

1033
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:32,962
"Blood type B has a feisty
and selfish personality."

1034
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:35,006
Isn't it something like that?

1035
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:38,551
I think I trust the blood type
personality theory even more.

1036
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:39,761
What are you…

1037
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:42,430
Here's one I find the most convincing.

1038
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:44,849
"He may have a sexual complex.

1039
01:00:44,932 --> 01:00:47,727
He either worked around the crime scene

1040
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,395
or resided there."

1041
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:52,315
"He's someone who does not
have many close friends."

1042
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:57,820
Most sex offenders are introverted
and have a sexual complex.

1043
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:00,114
If he targeted a minor
instead of a grown woman,

1044
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:03,660
it means he wanted to find
an easy target who wouldn't fight him.

1045
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:07,413
We must start investigating sex offenders

1046
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:08,998
who've committed a crime against minors.

1047
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:10,917
My gosh.

1048
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:13,795
Chief Heo.

1049
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:15,755
It can't happen, can it?

1050
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:19,092
No, we can't do this.

1051
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:21,386
Our team has pride.

1052
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:23,805
How can I give them order
with this report?

1053
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:25,264
Gil-pyo.

1054
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:28,685
Chief Heo. You have nothing to lose.

1055
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:30,186
At least try investigating.

1056
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:32,355
No, we can't do that.

1057
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:36,109
If we must investigate
every single ex-con,

1058
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:38,194
we'll need a lot of manpower too.

1059
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:39,612
Don't you think so?

1060
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,243
Here's what I'm trying to say.

1061
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:47,662
I think it'll be impossible

1062
01:01:47,745 --> 01:01:50,206
if we try to do this officially.

1063
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:56,838
OFF THE RECORD

1064
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:02,927
Just do it off the record.

1065
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:08,516
Let's end the meeting.

1066
01:02:10,017 --> 01:02:10,977
<i>Captain Yoon.</i>

1067
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:13,479
<i>This is the first and the last time.</i>

1068
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:14,731
DATABASE OF CRIMINAL RECORDS

1069
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:17,150
<i>Let's give a chance
to the Behavioral Analysis Team.</i>

1070
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:19,110
<i>If they help our investigation,</i>

1071
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:21,320
<i>we won't lose anything either.</i>

1072
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:24,949
<i>It's off the record,
so you'll have to move quietly.</i>

1073
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:26,576
I don't think this is the place.

1074
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:28,911
There. "Behavioral Analysis Team."

1075
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:35,293
-Hello.
-These are the lists of…

1076
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:39,046
-Let's do this.
-Yes.

1077
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:44,218
Your ID number

1078
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:46,095
is 630303-1126850.

1079
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:47,013
That's right.

1080
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,724
On May 20, where were you

1081
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:52,143
between 12 p.m. to 4 p.m.?

1082
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:57,815
LIST OF SEX OFFENDERS

1083
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:01,819
-Who are you?
-Please excuse us.

1084
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:06,616
It has been a while since I was released.
And I don't mess with kids.

1085
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:16,709
Where were you between 12 p.m.
and 4 p.m. on May 20?

1086
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:19,629
Ever since I was released,
I've kept a low profile.

1087
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:20,797
I'm innocent.

1088
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:24,175
-Thank you.
-Wait for me!

1089
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:35,436
Do you want ice cream?

1090
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:53,162
<i>Come out, come out</i>

1091
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:55,498
<i>Wherever you are</i>

1092
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:57,792
<i>Come out, come out</i>

1093
01:03:57,875 --> 01:04:00,002
<i>Wherever you are</i>

1094
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:02,255
<i>Come out, come out</i>

1095
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:03,631
<i>Wherever you are</i>

1096
01:04:03,714 --> 01:04:05,091
Come on, we have to hide!

1097
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:07,510
<i>Come out, come out</i>

1098
01:04:07,593 --> 01:04:10,221
<i>Wherever you are</i>

1099
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:12,598
<i>Come out, come out</i>

1100
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:15,142
<i>Wherever you are</i>

1101
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:17,979
<i>Come out, come out</i>

1102
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:20,565
<i>Wherever you are</i>

1103
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:26,445
<i>Where did things go wrong?</i>

1104
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:30,616
There's nothing we can do

1105
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,910
other than cross out the list.

1106
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:36,455
Don't beat yourself up so much.

1107
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:40,751
-Excuse me.
-Yes, what is it?

1108
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:45,256
Instead of searching the area
with the list of sex offenders,

1109
01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:49,302
why don't we try to find a sex offender
in the area who lives alone?

1110
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:51,637
That'll take too long.

1111
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:53,222
He has a point.

1112
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:57,935
If he recently moved to the area,
we may not find him on our list.

1113
01:04:58,019 --> 01:05:00,396
Yes, I don't think it's a bad idea.

1114
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:02,982
let's find a list of men
in their thirties and forties

1115
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:04,692
who live alone in the area.

1116
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:07,612
We started,
so let's get it done no matter what.

1117
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:09,530
Yes, let's do it.

1118
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:13,242
CHANGEUI-DONG OFFICE

1119
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:15,953
<i>I'm Senior Officer Nam Il-young
from Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.</i>

1120
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:19,665
<i>Give me a list of men in their thirties
and forties who live alone in this area.</i>

1121
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,292
<i>Everyone?</i>

1122
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:32,094
Take a look at that one.

1123
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:36,265
Captain Yoon.

1124
01:05:37,141 --> 01:05:38,768
You need to see this.

1125
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:40,394
These four weren't found

1126
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:43,022
on the criminal records database
at the police agency.

1127
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:46,233
They declared their move later,
so they weren't caught in the system.

1128
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:49,195
So some were left out.

1129
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:51,906
Yes, we might end up
catching the culprit easily.

1130
01:05:57,495 --> 01:06:00,164
Captain Kook, we need to meet.

1131
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:04,001
The four of us will check out
one address each.

1132
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:23,396
CRIMINAL HISTORY RECORD

1133
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:26,565
Changeui-dong Youngshin Apartment…

1134
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:34,448
39-1 CHANGEUI-DONG

1135
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:21,370
<i>The items are somewhat neatly organized.</i>

1136
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:36,844
<i>The house is close to the alley
in Changeui-dong</i>

1137
01:07:36,927 --> 01:07:38,763
<i>where the body parts were first found.</i>

1138
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,072
I think I found the place.

1139
01:07:57,573 --> 01:07:58,824
Wait for me.

1140
01:08:29,313 --> 01:08:31,732
<i>This guy is the culprit.</i>

1141
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:44,870
MISSING, LEE SOO-HYUN, AGE 5

1142
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:01,470
<i>I'm sure Soo-hyun's fingers
are around his house.</i>

1143
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:02,429
<i>There are only eight.</i>

1144
01:09:02,513 --> 01:09:04,849
We're missing two fingers of a girl!

1145
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:06,559
Please search thoroughly!

1146
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:07,518
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

1147
01:09:07,601 --> 01:09:10,020
<i>-Where are the two fingers…
-That haven't turned up yet?</i>

1148
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:11,564
There are three fingerprints?

1149
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:12,982
It's strange that
those were the only prints.

1150
01:09:13,065 --> 01:09:15,860
He either has an odd grip
or is missing fingers.

1151
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:18,404
<i>He disposed of the body parts
at different times and locations.</i>

1152
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:21,198
<i>-Where could…
-Cho Hyun-gil be hiding?</i>
