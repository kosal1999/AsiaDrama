1
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,462
And why do I want to help you?

2
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:48,089
Is it out of pity?

3
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,342
I know it isn't. That's why I...

4
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,803
It's because I like you. What are you...

5
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,139
going to do now?

6
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,316
Hey! Jun-u!

7
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:24,125
Hey! Are you... Are you okay?

8
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,094
Are you okay?

9
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,390
I'm fine,

10
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,477
but Bumbi's a mess.

11
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,103
Bumbi?

12
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,525
Is that its name?

13
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,118
I'm surprised. I see. This is Bumbi.

14
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:01,162
Hi, Bumbi. I'm Soo-bin.

15
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,292
No, it's not.

16
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:09,045
What? Let me introduce myself to Bumbi.

17
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,421
No, that's not it.

18
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,842
-Isn't this your friend?
-You misheard. You're mistaken.

19
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,305
-Soo-bin, is that what's going on?
-I want to say hi.

20
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,849
This isn't Bumbi.

21
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,773
Why did I...

22
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,692
You've lost your mind, Soo-bin.

23
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,486
I should really say something.

24
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,447
What do I say? Think, Jun-u.

25
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,783
Think.

26
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,827
-So...
-So...

27
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,167
Good, Jun-u. Tell me. What's your answer?

28
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,461
You go first.

29
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,630
What? What happened?

30
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,883
Was I just rejected?

31
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,678
About what I said earlier...

32
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:03,349
I was just kidding.
I was in a bad mood today,

33
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,226
so I was just...

34
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,562
What are you saying, Soo-bin?

35
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,317
I was kind of offended by what you said,

36
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,652
so I wanted to see what you'd do.

37
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:25,371
Bye.

38
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,458
Are you really...

39
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,508
Are you really

40
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,177
going to leave home?

41
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:46,017
That's what you said
to your mother earlier.

42
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,937
It's none of your business.

43
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,438
Hey.

44
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,904
Soo-bin. Seriously...

45
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,205
What's wrong with you, Jun-u?
Are you mute or something?

46
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,048
Hello.

47
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:21,344
That's right.
Relationships are all about timing.

48
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:25,431
If you miss that timing,
it's "Welcome to hell."

49
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,308
Timing.

50
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,352
Yeong-bae.

51
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,480
Did something happen again?

52
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:34,565
No.

53
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,152
Hey, Yeong-bae.

54
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,114
Be careful of that kid.

55
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:44,242
She looks all naive and innocent,

56
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,743
but she's wicked inside.

57
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,373
You know,
the girl who biked here with you.

58
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,250
The one with the super hot boyfriend!

59
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,710
Hey!

60
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,346
Soo-bin.

61
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,181
Soo-bin?

62
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,601
Don't be so hard on yourself.

63
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,106
How did you know I was hard on myself?

64
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,276
Did you guys hear...

65
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:22,739
We know you're like this
because you regret arguing with your mom.

66
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,701
My mom. I forgot.

67
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,286
What?

68
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,956
Did your mom hit you on the head
or something?

69
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:35,543
Maybe she has short-term memory loss.

70
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,630
Hey. Call your mom right now.

71
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,841
You should beg before it's too late.

72
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:45,470
Or you'll lose your allowance
and extend your sentence.

73
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,599
I'm not going home today.

74
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:50,683
What?

75
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,144
Not until my mom apologizes to me

76
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,271
and gives in. Never.

77
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,024
Who will put me up tonight?

78
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:04,030
We're redoing our kitchen
starting today, so it's a mess.

79
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,239
Sorry.

80
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,119
Da-huin?

81
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,413
Chan-yeol?

82
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:17,001
Hey. Do you think Ro-mi
is doing well on the level test?

83
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,253
That's right. It's today.

84
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,130
I'll ask.

85
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,359
SON JAE-YEONG MATHEMATICS

86
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:44,070
I'll do whatever it takes
to get Soo-bin back,

87
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,948
so please forget what she said
about quitting.

88
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,158
But ma'am, I don't think

89
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,619
Soo-bin wants to take my class.

90
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,330
Why don't you respect her wishes?

91
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:57,416
No. She doesn't know anything.

92
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,460
She's acting all self-righteous.

93
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,795
She's just acting out.

94
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,171
Hello.

95
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,091
I'm Ro-mi. Soo-bin's friend.

96
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,176
Okay. Hi.

97
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,012
I gave my answer sheet to the proctor.

98
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,348
Okay. Sure.

99
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,700
Soo-bin, that idiot.

100
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,952
Thanks to Soo-bin quitting
Mr. Son's class,

101
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,412
I was given an opportunity.

102
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,122
Thank you.

103
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,541
Soo-bin didn't quit.

104
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,585
What? That's what I heard.

105
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,128
You heard wrong.

106
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,671
My driver's here.

107
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,298
Goodbye, ma'am.

108
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,549
Okay. Bye.

109
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,677
Did you quit
just to give it away to that brat?

110
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,679
Darn it. That stupid moron.

111
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,431
Seriously.

112
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:56,476
Seriously. That idiot. Seriously!

113
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,061
You loser.

114
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,736
It's because I like you. What are you...

115
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,488
going to do now?

116
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,043
Does Soo-bin want to have it all?

117
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,045
That's ridiculous.

118
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,056
Welcome.

119
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,183
Jun-u, do you work here?

120
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,435
Yes.

121
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,771
That's kind of romantic.

122
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,149
How are you preparing for the midterm?

123
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:46,817
Welcome.

124
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,653
Which chapters
did you study at your old school?

125
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,154
Do you want to borrow my notebooks?

126
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,240
I don't usually let anyone see them,

127
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,617
-but you can--
-Well...

128
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,994
Moon Chan-yeol, right?

129
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,455
I'm kind of busy right now.

130
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:03,960
"Moon Chan-yeol"?

131
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,880
Sorry. Jung Da-huin?

132
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,799
No. Kwon Da-huin?

133
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,385
Here.

134
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:18,975
It's 13,600 won.

135
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,727
Here you go.

136
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,397
Are you trying to be funny?

137
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,483
Yoon So-ye?

138
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,194
Ro-mi. Hwang Ro-mi.

139
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,779
Say it. Hwang Ro-mi.

140
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,239
How much is this?

141
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,409
I'll have to scan it. Just a second.

142
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,327
Sorry.

143
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,502
It's 7,000 won.

144
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,761
What? He didn't even know my name?

145
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,222
How can he not know my name
if he likes me?

146
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,892
Then again, boys are like that.

147
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,604
Names are not important to them.

148
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,732
Still, he's pretty weird.

149
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,484
Ro-mi, how did the level test go?

150
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,070
Why are you so late?
I've been waiting for so long.

151
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:14,739
Hey.

152
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,117
You forgot this.

153
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,161
Thanks.

154
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,329
Are you Ro-mi's friend?

155
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:22,913
I'm her dad.

156
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,083
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

157
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,670
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

158
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,839
Okay. See you again.

159
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,264
Is he in your class?

160
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,600
What a good kid.
Working part-time and everything.

161
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,185
Why did you talk to him?

162
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,519
You shouldn't have.

163
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,189
Does he think I'm your driver too?

164
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,900
Oh, I made a mistake.

165
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,361
-What should I do?
-Forget it.

166
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:59,450
Yes. Okay. I'll deliver it right away.

167
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:03,621
Yeong-bae, I have to deliver
something to the academy.

168
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:04,914
Please stand in for me.

169
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,166
-I'll go.
-What?

170
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,043
-Would you do that?
-Yes.

171
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,503
Here.

172
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,421
Thanks.

173
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,439
Gosh, that was close.

174
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,202
Jun-u.

175
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,246
Did Hwi-yeong's mom send
something here again?

176
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:46,956
Yes.

177
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,254
Aren't these amazing?

178
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,798
I had to work my butt off to buy these.

179
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,970
What? Do you have something to tell me?

180
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,014
-About Mr. Son's watch...
-Sorry.

181
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,183
No comment. I don't want
to get involved in that.

182
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:09,854
I know that you're not
going to tell anyone.

183
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:21,782
Although you saw
Hwi-yeong steal that watch.

184
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:25,161
You'll just use it to tease him,

185
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:29,039
while waiting for the right time
to reveal it.

186
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,460
You're pretty smart.

187
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,502
That day,

188
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:35,963
what exactly happened?

189
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,882
Right before Hwi-yeong stole that watch.

190
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:38,841
That day?

191
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,218
That day...

192
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,306
That day, Mr. Son complimented me

193
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:46,932
on my math skills.

194
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,810
That must have driven Hwi-yeong crazy

195
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,979
and made him want to steal
Mr. Son's watch.

196
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,939
He's done that a few times before too.

197
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,983
He completely loses his mind
when he's upset.

198
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,987
Every time, his mom stepped in
and covered up for him.

199
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,616
I wish I had a mom like her too.

200
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,464
Hwi-yeong, I'll have to reveal

201
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,132
who you really are.

202
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,595
I have to put things right.

203
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,477
Soo-bin, are you crazy? How dare you?

204
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,812
You told me to get out.
I'm listening to you.

205
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,023
Oh, really?
Then you can live there forever.

206
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,400
Okay, I will.

207
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,528
I'll live my own life. I'm 18 now.

208
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:43,697
Soo-bin, don't you think
you're going too far?

209
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,699
I think I can do this.

210
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,369
You should live your own life too. Bye.

211
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,205
I don't know.
My fingers are out of control.

212
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,456
I must be crazy.

213
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,334
That feels better.

214
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,545
Aren't you going to send it?

215
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,256
-Here we go.
-Hey!

216
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:01,966
That was fake.

217
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,093
Man, you're such a coward.

218
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:08,472
If you can't even say harsh words
to your mom, why did you leave home?

219
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,724
You'll never be able to beat her.

220
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,437
Look at this card I picked.

221
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:19,817
Last time, you said
that meant I could beat her.

222
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,652
You said I should push forward.

223
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:23,654
Did I say that?

224
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,035
Ta-da!

225
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,162
What are you guys doing here?

226
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,706
You said you didn't have time today.

227
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,125
I said we couldn't be at my place.

228
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,459
I have Mom's permission too.

229
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,838
God, my house is tiny enough as it is.

230
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,256
Whatever.

231
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:45,968
This is so exciting! A pajama party!

232
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,178
Be quiet. A pajama party?

233
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,139
The exams are coming soon.

234
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,974
What are you guys thinking?

235
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,517
The exams are around the corner.

236
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,311
-You're right.
-Seriously.

237
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,062
Gosh, you guys.

238
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,108
Hey! Give me mine.

239
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:04,278
It's late, and my grandma needs to sleep.

240
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,155
So let's keep it down.

241
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,451
What if your grandma comes upstairs?

242
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:11,452
Play some music.

243
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,412
We'll just play some music, okay?

244
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,582
Here we go.

245
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,211
Stand up, guys. Right now.

246
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,005
Hey! Stop!

247
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,715
-Stop it.
-Be quiet.

248
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,759
-Stop it.
-Calm down.

249
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,303
-Here we go.
-Hey!

250
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,804
Get up!

251
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,057
-Seriously. It's late at night.
-You'll get in trouble.

252
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,433
-Be quiet.
-You started it.

253
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,772
So-ye, join us. Come on.

254
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:42,358
So-ye, are you still angry?

255
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,611
I'm in front of your house.

256
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,488
I'll wait until you come out.

257
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:53,827
Keep it down for grandma.

258
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:54,912
Yes.

259
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,960
-Yes.
-Why aren't you dancing?

260
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:05,130
It's okay.

261
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,716
-It's protein.
-It is.

262
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,803
Go. Go do what you want.

263
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,429
Go and live as you please now.

264
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,139
Did you think I wouldn't go?

265
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,101
Thank you for letting me live as I please.

266
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,694
You didn't run away from home, did you?

267
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,033
Should I not have sent it?

268
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,828
What are you up to?

269
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,541
-O-je.
-Yes?

270
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,835
-Go home now.
-Okay.

271
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:49,842
Why?

272
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,761
I'm delivering something
to Chan-yeol's house.

273
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,972
I wanted to give you
some tteokbokki if you were up.

274
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,766
My father's tteokbokki is phenomenal.

275
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,269
A delivery?

276
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,314
I hear the girls are there.
You know, Soo-bin's gang.

277
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,067
It's Ms. Da-huin's order.

278
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,363
What's with you, Soo-bin?

279
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,365
Did you really run away?

280
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,704
I'll take a rain check on tteokbokki.

281
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,920
Is Soo-bin staying out tonight?

282
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,509
Would she?

283
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,096
No. I'm sure she'll go home.

284
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,976
But it's dangerous to walk alone at night.

285
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,316
Maybe she's sleeping over.

286
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,412
I go walk her home.

287
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,164
I don't.

288
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:15,010
People usually take this as a yes.
That's right.

289
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,012
This means that I should go.

290
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,146
Where is Chan-yeol's place?

291
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,901
Good. Jun-u, you got this.

292
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:35,197
I'll respond properly this time.
I really will.

293
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:44,540
Just leave. I'm going to sleep over
at Chan-yeol's place with the girls.

294
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,751
Chan-yeol's place?

295
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,385
Soo-bin is at Chan-yeol's place.

296
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,595
Soo-bin, this girl...

297
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,222
LEE GI-TAE

298
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,558
REMINDERS

299
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,852
I haven't finished everything for today.

300
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,965
I'm in front of Chan-yeol's place.
I'll wait for you.

301
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,550
Until the morning if I have to.

302
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,307
-Right over here.
-Yes, I see it.

303
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:47,060
My baby whom I love the most
in the whole wide world.

304
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,479
"What if she graduates
from a mediocre university?

305
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,108
And what if people look down
on her because of that?"

306
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,676
So-ye, are you leaving?

307
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,761
Yes.

308
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,930
My mom is here to pick me up.

309
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,725
I'm off. I'm sorry.

310
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,695
Gosh, am I going overboard?

311
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,990
I think she'll go home, though.

312
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:26,952
What if she asks me why I've come?

313
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,916
Soo-bin, you should go home.

314
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,049
-Hey, Soo-bin.
-Gosh! You scared me, Hwi-yeong.

315
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,259
Did I scare you?

316
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:46,096
I'm sorry. You came out
when I was about to message you.

317
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,932
-What brings you here?
-I came to walk you home.

318
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,810
My mom asked you to bring me home, right?

319
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:55,105
No. I heard your mom visited
the school today,

320
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,108
so I figured you'd throw a fit
to rebel against your mom.

321
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,070
-Let's go.
-No, it's okay.

322
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,280
I can go home alone.

323
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,657
It's dangerous.
And that alley is too dark.

324
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,951
-Let's go.
-It's really okay.

325
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,425
You're too late, Jun-u...

326
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:32,434
Since it's midterm season,
you must be really stressed out.

327
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,356
By the way, I wanted to ask you something.

328
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:39,816
What is it?

329
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,153
Did something happen
between you and Jun-u?

330
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,573
Why do you ask?

331
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:50,660
You guys went to the counseling office
together the other day.

332
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,496
And you two seem a little...

333
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:59,252
The counselor wanted to know
how Jun-u was doing at school.

334
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,590
She also asked if Jun-u hit me

335
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,217
for any other reasons.

336
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,014
Do you think I'm hiding something
from you?

337
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,434
No, it's not that.

338
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,231
Did I upset you?

339
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:24,653
Come on. I think you're a little upset.

340
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,947
-No, I'm not upset.
-Gosh.

341
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,035
You probably have no idea
how much of a jerk I am.

342
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:36,331
Come on. Don't get upset over
a tiny thing, Little Boy Hwi-yeong.

343
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,208
I'm really not upset.

344
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,334
Really?

345
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,176
I liked it when I used to be
your Little Boy Hwi-yeong.

346
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,303
When I could tell you everything.

347
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:53,431
You used to scold me
and slap me on the back.

348
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,436
What? Then shall I give you
a big slap on the back now?

349
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,565
-It's all right.
-It's nothing hard. I'll just...

350
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,024
Forget it.

351
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,572
It's getting late. Let's hurry.

352
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,159
Shall we run? It is quite late now.

353
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,244
You can't keep up with me.

354
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:19,374
Hey, Soo-bin. Wait up!

355
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:20,417
Bye!

356
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,523
Mom, I'm back.

357
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:48,778
I'll do well on my midterm exam, okay?

358
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,573
I'll get into the top tier in math.

359
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,451
So believe in me just one more time.

360
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:59,581
Soo-bin, we can't afford

361
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:03,543
to observe the situation
in a relaxed manner,

362
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,130
go through trial and error,

363
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,050
and reflect on our mistakes

364
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:13,136
at the moment.

365
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:15,764
You're in 2nd grade, for God's sake.

366
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:20,518
For you, every second of the day
should be exam season.

367
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:23,647
Even the slightest mistake

368
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,107
can push you off the steep cliff.

369
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:33,281
Gosh. Come on, Mom.

370
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,451
Why are you so negative?

371
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:39,079
Don't think like that, please.
Give me one more chance, okay?

372
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:41,957
Please? I'll do a good job. Okay?

373
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,416
I'll study hard.

374
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,544
Oh, right.
After you came to school earlier.

375
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:50,131
After you left, my arm
became like Ma Dong-seok's arm.

376
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,841
-What? My goodness.
-The actor, Ma Dong-seok.

377
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,677
Along with the Gods.
You saw the movie, right?

378
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,762
Gosh, my arm swelled up this much earlier.

379
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:58,306
-My gosh!
-I hit your shoulder, not your arm.

380
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,557
No, it was right here.

381
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,310
-You hit here.
-Hey, Ma Dong-seok's arm is...

382
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,313
Ouch! My gosh, it hurts so much.

383
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,065
It hurts so much!

384
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,693
I'm in pain! Anyway, I'm going to study.

385
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,027
I'll go study!

386
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:12,821
Good night!

387
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,042
Where have you been?

388
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,965
I just stepped out to get some fresh air.

389
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:34,592
You keep getting distracted
because you're not focused.

390
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:37,595
You feel frustrated and itchy all over.

391
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:41,641
I'm heading upstairs.

392
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,020
Your homeroom teacher

393
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,564
can't return to school
because he's hospitalized, right?

394
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,443
How did you know?

395
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,739
The assistant teacher has
officially become our homeroom teacher.

396
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,509
Mom,

397
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:17,886
again?

398
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,597
It's midterm season.

399
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,098
Sit down.

400
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,986
You'll never be able to see Soo-bin again

401
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,821
if you step out again like you did today.

402
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:48,583
I love you.

403
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,733
You didn't run away from home, did you?

404
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:17,987
Is that all he sent? What is he doing?

405
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:21,950
I mean, if you're worried,
ask more questions.

406
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:26,246
But then again, why would you
be worried about me?

407
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,790
I'm sure he was just bored.

408
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:34,462
Soo-bin. Why did you have to say that?

409
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:40,802
Seriously. This whole day
has been humiliating. God...

410
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:01,573
Also, I'm not Hwi-yeong's girlfriend.

411
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,576
Liar.

412
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:14,169
Soo-bin, you're a liar.

413
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,431
About what I said earlier...

414
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,016
I was just kidding.

415
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:32,270
I was in a bad mood today,

416
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:33,563
so I was just...

417
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:37,358
I was kind of offended by what you said,

418
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,944
so I wanted to see what you'd do.

419
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:46,951
She was really kidding?

420
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,442
Hey, Jun-u.

421
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,861
-Hi.
-Hi, O-je.

422
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,863
O-je!

423
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,782
-Hi.
-Hi.

424
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,992
-Did you have breakfast?
-Of course.

425
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,870
I made tuna salad. Do you like tuna?

426
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:34,374
Hey.

427
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:38,920
Hi, Jun-u.

428
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,339
Hey. Hi.

429
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:47,470
So... Why didn't you reply
to my text yesterday?

430
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:50,765
That... I did see

431
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,976
the text, but...

432
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,395
Hey, Soo-bin!

433
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:57,355
Hi.

434
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:01,401
Never mind. Bumbi's all better.

435
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,903
Bum... What's Bumbi?

436
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:09,534
Well... Jun-u's bike...

437
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:10,952
That's a secret.

438
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,916
You're close enough
to share your bike's pet name?

439
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,877
What's this about?

440
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,920
It's not like that.

441
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,886
Let's go. Okay. Let's go.

442
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:39,439
See?

443
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:43,276
He turns all red whenever he sees me.

444
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,861
How cute.

445
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,196
Now I know.

446
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,948
It wasn't her.

447
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,366
It was her.

448
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,786
Ro-mi. How did you do
on your level test yesterday?

449
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:54,871
Obviously.

450
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:57,582
Your mom came to the academy yesterday.

451
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:00,460
She seemed really angry because of you.

452
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,171
Yes.

453
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,465
So-ye. When did you leave yesterday?

454
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:11,846
Sorry. My mom wanted me home. Sorry.

455
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,264
You traitors.

456
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,600
You made Da-huin and me
the sacrificial lambs.

457
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,060
She and I couldn't study at all.

458
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:18,603
Did you go home too?

459
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:20,688
Yes.

460
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:28,655
Bring this to the classroom,
and pick up the printouts.

461
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:29,822
Okay.

462
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,834
Change your seats back to the way
they were.

463
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,006
I made myself clear, so...

464
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,175
Gosh. Okay.

465
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,975
Good morning, everyone.

466
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,060
Let's begin...

467
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,939
What's with the seats?

468
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,942
We'll stay in these seats.

469
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:08,319
-That's what everyone wants.
-Everyone?

470
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,532
Did you take a vote in that short time?

471
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,325
No, but...

472
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:17,161
Everyone says this is good
for the exams coming up.

473
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,246
That's right.

474
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,415
I like this.

475
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,291
-Me too.
-That's right.

476
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,627
It's only good for them.

477
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:29,382
Is that unanimous? There isn't
a single person who doesn't like it?

478
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,343
I don't like it.

479
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,429
Okay.

480
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:40,685
Me neither.

481
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,982
Me too. I don't...

482
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,486
Okay, then.

483
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:52,864
How about we do this?

484
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,787
What is this?

485
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:03,708
My goodness.

486
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,382
Gosh.

487
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,927
That's Class Three again, isn't it?

488
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:19,640
Okay, everyone who agrees with
the class president sits up front.

489
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,268
Everyone else, sit wherever you want
in the back.

490
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:24,353
-Begin.
-Okay!

491
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,397
-Let's go, O-je.
-Who wants to sit with me?

492
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,985
-Who wants to sit with me?
-Da-huin, O-je.

493
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,529
Soo-bin, So-ye. Where do you want to sit?

494
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,655
I'm going there.

495
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:37,742
Okay.

496
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,623
-Jun-u.
-Hey.

497
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,958
Ro-mi. Where's your seat?

498
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,668
Yun-jin. Sit here.

499
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:53,716
Okay.

500
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,220
But Ro-mi. I may be uncomfortable
sitting way up front...

501
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,013
But then again...

502
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,766
-Hey. Pil-sang.
-Don't do it.

503
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,686
Wow, Pil-sang.

504
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,856
Pil-sang has changed.
You're sitting up front?

505
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,817
Welcome.

506
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:15,446
Okay, are we done?

507
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,076
Mr. Oh.

508
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,454
This will make it too distracting
to study.

509
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,081
Why? It's nice.

510
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:29,127
Pil-sang is sitting up front,
trying to study hard this time.

511
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,128
Isn't this nice?

512
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,088
Yes! It's nice!

513
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:34,215
See that? It's all about perspective.

514
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:37,844
Hwi-yeong, you should relax
a little too. Relax.

515
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,221
That stupid Oh Han-gyeol.

516
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:44,183
New teachers always do that to stand out.

517
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,144
It's so annoying.

518
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,273
Why did our homeroom teacher
have to get hurt again?

519
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,025
He shouldn't drink so much.

520
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,529
But Mr. Oh's our official homeroom
teacher now.

521
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:57,780
We have to listen.

522
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,366
He's totally in power now.

523
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,161
He has the student council
in the palm of his hand too.

524
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,954
-Look closely.
-I don't know.

525
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,957
I had to work my butt off
to buy these from a reseller.

526
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,375
-Aren't they awesome?
-Let me try.

527
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,586
Don't touch.
You're not supposed to touch them.

528
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,379
Just look. Aren't they awesome?

529
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:17,258
Hey. Hwi-yeong.

530
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,594
Are you studying hard for the midterm?

531
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,683
He ignored me.

532
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,603
Just wait, Hwi-yeong.

533
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,772
I'll beat you in the midterm.

534
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:36,903
That clown Sang-hun. What's with him?

535
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:41,782
Don't mind him.

536
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:46,037
Look. As you can see, the lengths
of the two diagonals

537
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,873
are five and eight. What does that mean?

538
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,708
This has to be five.

539
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,710
And this has to be eight.

540
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:55,671
Okay. The angle between the diagonals
is 60 degrees.

541
00:36:55,755 --> 00:37:00,635
Then figure out the area
of quadrilateral A, B, C, and D.

542
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,221
-Let's see.
-Look at them.

543
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,847
All lovey-dovey.

544
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:10,353
A', B', C',

545
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,980
D'... The area is...

546
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,317
Jun-u couldn't look happier.

547
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,527
Kids said they saw him
staring at Ro-mi all the time.

548
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:19,946
I can see that it was true.

549
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,114
Boys are all the same.

550
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:25,076
-Except for my O-je.
-...20 times the square root of 3.

551
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,245
-So...
-Ro-mi

552
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,789
doesn't usually smile so much, does she?

553
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:30,957
This is new.

554
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,416
I know.

555
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,585
Ro-mi, the ice queen,

556
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,295
is smiling from ear to ear.

557
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:39,006
Study. Let's study. Exams, remember?

558
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,395
Jun-u, are you so happy?

559
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:55,314
Soo-bin.

560
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:59,360
Why did you say that to him?

561
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,534
Pil-sang, cut it out.

562
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,077
Okay.

563
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:11,956
Did you doze off?

564
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,834
Doesn't it hurt? Are you okay?

565
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:16,585
Yes.

566
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,937
I think we've become in charge
of more and more areas.

567
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,939
Gi-tae decided who cleans which areas.

568
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,942
It might be because of me.

569
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,361
Maybe.

570
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:44,905
Let's just accept it.

571
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:53,539
The math teacher must be
really scared of Hwi-yeong.

572
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,712
Sang-hun is the math teacher's favorite.

573
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:03,007
They have to meet in secret
because he's so jealous.

574
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:05,885
Come on, you're good at this.

575
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:08,179
Give that to me. I'll go in.

576
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,732
Hwi-yeong, let me do that.
You should study.

577
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,151
Thanks.

578
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,157
Thanks.

579
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,241
No problem.

580
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,924
Do you know where Ma Hwi-yeong is?

581
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,051
Hwi-yeong? Why?

582
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,598
Hwi-yeong, the math teacher
wants you to come to the math office.

583
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,979
Sang-hun, as always,

584
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,107
you understand what I teach you so fast.

585
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,776
This is why I like you so much.

586
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:05,486
I know your favorite is Hwi-yeong.

587
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:08,155
My favorite student is you.

588
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,782
Don't you know that?

589
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:12,827
You should really switch
to the natural sciences track.

590
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,578
Then you'll easily become
the very top student.

591
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,288
You're a math genius.

592
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:18,624
That'll be much easier for you.

593
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:19,708
Sir.

594
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:22,628
I'll make sure Hwi-yeong doesn't
get the highest grades here.

595
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,130
You're joking, right?

596
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,297
No. I mean it.

597
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,925
You have no idea how fun it is

598
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,385
to trample on Hwi-yeong.

599
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:32,972
I'm saying this because I care about you.

600
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:36,725
Hwi-yeong.

601
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:37,977
Did you want to see me?

602
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,061
Me?

603
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:42,773
No. If I wanted to see you,
I would have messaged you.

604
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,528
I was asking him about a math question.

605
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,238
You're already finished with it, right?

606
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,992
That's why you're the best student
in our year. Shit, I'm so jealous.

607
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,952
Come on. Watch your language.

608
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,247
Excuse me.

609
00:40:58,956 --> 00:40:59,957
All right.

610
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,183
My favorite student is you.

611
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:01,101
Don't you know that?

612
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:04,396
I'll make sure Hwi-yeong doesn't
get the highest grades here.

613
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,982
You have no idea how fun it is

614
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,526
to trample on Hwi-yeong.

615
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:13,405
Just wait, Hwi-yeong.
I'll beat you in the midterm.

616
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,803
Your heart is about to explode, right?

617
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:37,888
Jealousy.

618
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:39,765
Anxiety.

619
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,476
So this is the issue you have.

620
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,353
If someone gets on your nerves,

621
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:48,232
you have to get rid of the thing that
person treasures most to feel relieved.

622
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:50,609
What are you talking about?

623
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:53,946
This is just a prank.

624
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:55,114
A prank?

625
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:59,451
Was stealing your academy teacher's watch
a prank too?

626
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,371
And then you framed me for it

627
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,249
and came up with a plan
to kick me out of this school.

628
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:07,251
Were those pranks too?

629
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:09,545
You're just making all that up.

630
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:11,714
Do you know why you do this?

631
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,424
It's because

632
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,302
you only care about yourself.

633
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:19,221
You look down on everyone else.

634
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,182
When people you look down on
get on your nerves,

635
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,227
you can't stand it.

636
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,447
You're very imaginative.

637
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,409
So? What are you planning to do?

638
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,536
What if you spread that made-up story

639
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,371
as if it's my weakness?

640
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:46,790
Do you think that'll humiliate me?

641
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:48,667
No.

642
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:50,919
I will make you feel sorry

643
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,881
for those who you've looked down on.

644
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:56,717
I will make you feel
genuinely sorry for them.

645
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,220
You're just a pathetic little...

646
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,138
Hwi--

647
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:05,809
I told him to come here.

648
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,313
You have to plant that too, right?

649
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:13,567
Just like how you planted
that teacher's watch in my locker.

650
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,408
That little...

651
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,884
God... The midterm...

652
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:42,262
It's time for my appetite
to be out of control.

653
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:44,848
Shoot, I suddenly feel so lousy.

654
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,850
-Me too.
-Soo-bin!

655
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:49,895
I failed that level test
because of you, right?

656
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:52,940
-What?
-Did you fail the level test?

657
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:57,236
Didn't you see me
tell Mr. Son I was quitting?

658
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:58,487
Then is it your mom?

659
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:01,698
She said you weren't quitting
Mr. Son's class.

660
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:02,950
Ro-mi.

661
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,284
Are they fighting?

662
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,081
Don't you think you're out of line?

663
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,791
Why else would I have failed?

664
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,751
Even you passed the test.
How could I fail?

665
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,170
-Maybe you did badly on the test.
-Why would I?

666
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:17,631
Ro-mi, stop. Why are you fighting?

667
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:19,591
-Stop fighting.
-Move, O-je. Move.

668
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,760
-O-je.
-Gosh, I can't believe this.

669
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,345
Why would I fail that test?

670
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:27,933
Gosh, I feel dizzy.

671
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:30,894
-What?
-Stop putting on a show.

672
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,731
Soo-bin. Hey!

673
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:35,816
Hey!

674
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:37,443
Put her down.

675
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:57,004
Soo-bin!

676
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,595
Try to understand.

677
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,972
You know that's just how Ro-mi is.

678
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,558
Gosh, I knew Ro-mi would do this.

679
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,935
She's the one who did badly
on the level test.

680
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,608
What's wrong with me?

681
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:20,736
-What's the matter with me?
-Come on. Don't take it to heart.

682
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,447
We all know how ill-tempered
and rude Ro-mi can be.

683
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,658
-I regret it.
-What do you regret?

684
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,368
Quitting Mr. Son's class?

685
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:30,954
No.

686
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,498
Fighting with your mom?

687
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:36,251
I don't even know.
I have so much on my mind now.

688
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:38,754
I have too much on my mind.

689
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,052
Just let it go, okay?

690
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,809
STUDENT RECORDS, MA HWI-YEONG

691
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,187
ACADEMIC AWARDS AND RECOGNITIONS

692
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,983
Because the one controlling Gi-tae

693
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:02,194
is Hwi-yeong.

694
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:12,829
CLASS THREE, MR. KIM

695
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:19,711
Hello, ma'am. This is Oh Han-gyeol.

696
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,255
I'm sorry I keep calling you.

697
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,382
I was just wondering

698
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,176
if Mr. Kim is still too unable
to talk on the phone.

699
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,761
Is he still very ill?

700
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:32,266
I just wanted to ask a few things
about the kids of Class Three.

701
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,101
Sorry? Hello?

702
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,771
Yes. I'll call you again
some other time, then. Thank you.

703
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:48,323
CHOE JUN-U

704
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:10,137
Hwi-yeong is here early,
so it's obviously exam season.

705
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:15,142
I feel suffocated.

706
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,380
I organized what you need to memorize.

707
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,844
You already got all this done?

708
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:35,639
Give it to me when you're done.

709
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:36,723
I have one too.

710
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,642
I made another copy while working on mine

711
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,352
to give it to you.

712
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,603
Really?

713
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:45,440
-So-ye.
-Yes?

714
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:47,317
Let's do well on the midterm.

715
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:51,071
-Thanks, Gi-tae.
-Just a second.

716
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,838
-What are you looking at?
-Pil-sang.

717
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,590
I can't concentrate because of you.

718
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:13,385
Oh, sorry.

719
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:47,252
Hello.

720
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,339
-Mom.
-Jun-u.

721
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,509
-Mom, why...
-What?

722
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,138
And why are you wearing...

723
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,641
Your exams are starting tomorrow.

724
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,852
You should study hard.

725
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:06,605
Your mother will cover your shift.

726
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:10,400
She pestered Boss for three hours.

727
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:18,533
Hey, you need to do very well
on the exams.

728
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:21,536
You have to get good grades
and prove you can do well too.

729
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,580
Yes, of course.

730
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:25,957
What about the restaurant?

731
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:28,168
Well, I'm using
the rest of my vacation days.

732
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:32,255
Jun-u, you should just go home
and study hard.

733
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:35,383
No, how about you sign up
for a cram academy?

734
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:37,052
Yes, that's a good idea.

735
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,888
Aren't there ones that are
specifically designed to help you

736
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:41,181
prepare for the midterm?

737
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,976
Let's go. Let's just go
to the academy and find out.

738
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:49,606
Wait, ma'am! Your shift is about to begin.

739
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:54,027
For now, just go home and study. Okay?

740
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,904
Go. Go on.

741
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:57,447
Bye.

742
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,741
All right, bye for now.

743
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:05,914
What shall I start with?

744
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:07,582
-Shall we try this again?
-Sure.

745
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,543
-Let's go over it again.
-Sounds good.

746
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:18,552
Gosh, my mom's too much.

747
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:35,026
Yoo Soo-bin,

748
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:37,445
good luck.

749
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:42,534
YOO SOO-BIN, GOOD LUCK!

750
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:50,876
Have some red ginseng.

751
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:55,589
You promised me
that you'll get into the top tier in math.

752
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,217
Gosh, she's all focused.

753
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:18,945
Gosh, math...

754
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:21,156
Top tier.

755
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:41,509
Check your answers before you submit
your answer sheet.

756
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:46,556
Those in the back row, collect the sheets.

757
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:07,202
Hwi-yeong, what are you doing?

758
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:09,079
Just a moment, please.

759
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:11,831
-I have to--
-I told you to wait.

760
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,875
We need to collect the answer sheets.

761
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:15,961
Just a second, please.

762
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:19,047
-Hwi-yeong, you must submit yours.
-Give me a second, please. This is...

763
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:20,590
MA HWI-YEONG, MATH

764
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:22,550
For God's sake, I said wait!

765
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:30,225
Dad.

766
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:34,229
I said I'd kill you if you didn't
get the highest marks on the exams.

767
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:35,563
Hwi-yeong.

768
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,109
How could you fall asleep?

769
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:43,613
How will you manage to be top of your year
if you sleep this much?

770
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:48,702
Hwi-yeong has been studying hard.

771
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,161
He was just taking a short break.

772
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,622
You pathetic good-for-nothings.

773
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:57,377
I work my butt off so that you two
can enjoy this comfortable life.

774
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,838
How dare you sleep as much as you want?

775
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:01,923
Right outside our house

776
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:03,258
are a ton of people

777
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:05,885
vigilantly awaiting an opportunity
to take what belongs to us.

778
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:08,054
Aren't you going to focus?

779
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:12,183
If you don't get the highest grades
in the midterm,

780
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,854
I'll kick both of you
out of the house naked.

781
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:39,252
Hwi-yeong. No, don't.
Don't scratch, please.

782
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:40,462
Don't scratch.

783
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:09,407
I need to ace the math test.

784
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:10,992
I need to prove myself

785
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:14,829
to Mom and myself.

786
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,000
What's wrong with you, Soo-bin?

787
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:21,086
You need to focus.

788
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:24,881
Soo-bin, do you feel sick?

789
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:33,098
I'm sorry, but may I go
to the nurse's office?

790
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:35,475
The nurse's office? Let's go.

791
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:41,773
-Soo-bin. Oh, no.
-Oh, my god.

792
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:44,859
Quiet. This is a test. Stay in your seats.

793
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:47,403
-Soo-bin?
-I'll carry her.

794
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:12,679
Get back to the test.

795
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:20,145
I'll be right back.

796
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:24,399
Okay, quiet. Focus on the test.

797
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:29,529
My test...

798
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,948
What about her test?
She probably didn't finish.

799
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:34,284
I know. We still have 20 minutes left.

800
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:38,538
Can she take the test
in the nurse's office?

801
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:39,789
I heard that was allowed.

802
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:42,375
That will work. I'll get her test papers.

803
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,002
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

804
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,966
Don't worry. You'll feel better
if you take medicine.

805
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:51,384
You can take the test.

806
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:54,679
Jun-u's back is warm.

807
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:57,599
I didn't think it would be, but it's warm.

808
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:08,234
Ma'am. Soo-bin.

809
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:09,360
What's wrong?

810
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:13,281
Do you feel sick?

811
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:16,326
Let's see.

812
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:18,203
Hold on.

813
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:23,041
It looks like acute stomach cramps.

814
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:24,542
Hold on.

815
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:30,840
Jun-u, here's your test.

816
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:33,384
I'm fine.

817
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:35,053
You're a student too.

818
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:15,176
Did you finish?

819
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:17,971
Jun-u.

820
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,223
Soo-bin.

821
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:25,103
I'll turn them in
to the math teacher, so wait here.

822
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:51,796
Are you feeling better now?

823
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:56,467
Yes. Thanks.

824
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:59,262
I'm sorry you lost time for the test
because of me.

825
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:00,346
Sorry.

826
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:02,515
It's okay.

827
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:05,059
I had no idea how to solve
the problems in the back anyway.

828
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,652
You can go now. I can stay by myself.

829
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:16,446
I will once the nurse gets back.

830
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:19,782
Am I making you uncomfortable?

831
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:24,495
I'll go then.

832
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,887
Hey. Your hand.

833
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:45,850
Was it from earlier?

834
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:47,769
I didn't know.

835
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:51,022
You should have the nurse treat it.

836
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:52,357
It may get infected.

837
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:55,985
It's okay.

838
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:58,321
Get it treated.

839
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:03,326
Maybe I should.

840
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:23,179
Hey.

841
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:26,474
About what I said the other day.

842
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:28,768
Which part?

843
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,396
When Bumbi...

844
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:35,441
When your bike broke. I mean...

845
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,861
What I said right before it broke.

846
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:41,864
Please forget it.

847
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:42,949
Me too.

848
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,201
What?

849
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,704
I was going to say this then too.

850
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,247
Exactly.

851
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:52,834
I know what you're about to say.

852
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,175
What?

853
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:02,969
I wanted to get some water.

854
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:04,721
-I'll get it.
-No,

855
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:05,805
it's okay.

856
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:14,355
So... That is...

857
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:16,858
Don't feel bad...

858
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:22,238
Just... forget... everything...

859
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:24,532
I like you.

860
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:40,047
I like you too.

861
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:54,687
I like you.

862
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:17,376
Mr. Oh, I think I've seen that boy
somewhere before.

863
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,462
-He was forced to transfer--
-It was just a regular one.

864
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:21,589
Why did he carry you earlier?
Why does he keep coming up?

865
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:23,216
Don't even go anywhere near him.

866
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:25,176
The answer is number two.

867
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:27,929
It's just one question.
Don't worry so much.

868
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:29,514
What do you know?

869
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:31,349
I've been thinking it over,

870
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:33,851
and I guess I'll accept you. Let's go out.

871
01:03:34,852 --> 01:03:36,103
Rock-paper-scissors!

872
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:40,817
Soo-bin, you're like a pea. A tiny pea.

873
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:42,568
Soo-bin.

874
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:48,491
Hello, I'm Choe Jun-u.
