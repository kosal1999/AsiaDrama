1
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:45,920
Because you were out of line.

2
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:51,301
You started to raise doubts about me
instead of getting lost quietly.

3
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:52,635
How dare you do that...

4
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:55,889
to me.

5
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,065
You should eat something.
Hey, what are you doing?

6
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,775
-Jun-u.
-Hey, Jun-u.

7
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,027
Hey, stop him!

8
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,029
Stop them.

9
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,781
Hey, Jun-u, stop!

10
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,699
Jun-u, what's wrong? Jun-u!

11
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,326
Jun-u, stop!

12
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,721
He really said that to you earlier?

13
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:42,727
But why did you hit Hwi-yeong then?

14
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:45,939
You said Gi-tae was the one who paid them.
Why did you hit Hwi-yeong?

15
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,440
Because the one controlling Gi-tae

16
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,025
is Hwi-yeong.

17
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:50,860
Hwi-yeong?

18
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,448
Come on. Why would Hwi-yeong do that?

19
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,247
Hwi-yeong. Are you really okay?

20
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,290
Don't you have to go to the hospital?

21
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:05,625
I'm fine.

22
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:16,719
By the way,
why did Jun-u hit you all of a sudden?

23
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,722
Did something happen between you two?

24
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:20,890
No.

25
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:24,018
Jun-u is probably
mentally unstable right now.

26
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,855
I heard they've been best friends
since childhood.

27
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,858
I guess his emotions suddenly exploded.

28
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,818
I understand.

29
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,156
Do you remember the guys who came earlier

30
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,740
to pay their respects?

31
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:39,993
Did they say something to him?

32
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,997
What would they say to him?

33
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,713
Oh, my math teacher called me.

34
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,548
Just a second.

35
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,140
Why isn't he picking up?

36
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,894
The person you have called
is not available.

37
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,788
-You're getting a call.
-What?

38
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,460
7 MISSING CALLS
HWI-YEONG

39
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,050
-What?
-What happened?

40
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:38,760
It's my tutor.

41
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,053
It's nothing serious.

42
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,680
Emergency.
Tutoring apartment in 30 minutes.

43
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:48,770
So-ye, my tutor wants to start
early today.

44
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,313
I have to go now.

45
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,106
-So suddenly?
-I have a lesson.

46
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,025
Sorry. I'll get going.

47
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,236
Continue practicing.
I'll message you later.

48
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,822
Jun-u, hang in there, okay?

49
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:00,907
Let's talk again.

50
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:02,951
Okay.

51
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,245
All right. Go back in.

52
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,459
Jun-u.

53
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,336
See you at school.

54
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,765
It must be so hard for Jun-u.

55
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:29,811
Yes. He's probably staying here
until his friend's family arrives.

56
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,398
Thank you all, guys.

57
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:34,941
Hwi-yeong, are you okay?

58
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,609
Yes.

59
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,070
I hope Jun-u will
pull himself together soon.

60
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,405
I'm worried.

61
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,201
Right.

62
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,496
Let's go.

63
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:07,890
How strange. Why am I feeling this way?

64
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,934
My heart aches a little.

65
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:11,853
Jeong-hu,

66
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,397
what do I do now?

67
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,738
What...

68
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,326
am I supposed to do?

69
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,760
Gi-tae, did you give them money?

70
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,053
Are you crazy?

71
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,724
I had no choice. They said
they wouldn't do it without getting paid.

72
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,851
You told me to drive Jun-u away
by all means.

73
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,146
Jun-u's friend died.

74
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:59,025
If things go wrong,
we might take all the blame.

75
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,903
What are you talking about?

76
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,530
I mean... Why?

77
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,740
I don't know!

78
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,373
He had a car accident on his way to work
after quitting school.

79
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,376
What will you do if someone finds out
you paid those guys?

80
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:21,964
Hwi-yeong, you said you'd take
responsibility if there's any problem.

81
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,883
That depends on the problem. Did I--

82
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,346
Did I tell you to pay them?

83
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,102
What should I do?

84
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,395
What do I do?

85
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,857
-What do I do now?
-Why are you asking me?

86
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,209
So-ye.

87
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,545
What are you doing here?

88
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,090
So-ye.

89
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,511
So-ye!

90
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,138
Are you guys dating?

91
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,889
Does she know what we did?

92
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,324
So-ye.

93
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,829
Did you follow me?

94
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,082
Why?

95
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,793
So the rumor was true.

96
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,088
Lee Gi-tae is Ma Hwi-yeong's minion.

97
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,091
So-ye, that's not it.

98
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,511
How could you even do...

99
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,765
I'm disappointed in you, Gi-tae.

100
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,321
What's with So-ye?

101
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,114
She's not picking up her phone.

102
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,993
She ignored all my messages yesterday too.

103
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,579
Seriously, what's going on?

104
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,711
I'm back.

105
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,131
Did it go well?

106
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,716
Are you okay?

107
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,309
What about O-je?

108
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:40,811
Where's my O-je?

109
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,773
He's at the store.

110
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,235
How is Jun-u holding up?

111
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,157
Not very well.

112
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,035
They've been best friends since childhood.

113
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,582
Guys, just a second.

114
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,587
Soo-bin, you're taking
Mr. Son's class today, right?

115
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,506
Stay with Hwi-yeong.

116
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:12,134
The midterm's coming soon. Ask him
in detail how he's preparing.

117
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,761
Isn't it so great?

118
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,680
-You're in the same class as him.
-Yes.

119
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:18,891
Okay.

120
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,395
Did you find out?

121
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,273
Your level test score for Mr. Son's class.

122
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,775
You said you'd find out
whether you passed or not.

123
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:28,818
There you go again.

124
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,696
Ro-mi, do you really think
this is a good time for that?

125
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,369
-Do you want to know?
-Yes.

126
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:40,955
Pack up.

127
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,086
You're quitting? Why?

128
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,673
You won't let me know my level test score.

129
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,800
It doesn't really feel right.

130
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,761
Also, I prefer studying alone.

131
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,848
Still, this is too sudden.

132
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,017
I'm sorry.

133
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,062
I brought a friend who wants to see you.

134
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,063
Ro-mi.

135
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,940
Hello.

136
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,192
I'm Soo-bin's friend, Hwang Ro-mi.

137
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,652
I'm also close to Hwi-yeong.

138
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,738
I see. Hi.

139
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,073
Please let me take the level test.

140
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,074
What?

141
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,749
I'm trying to get you
into Hwi-yeong's math class.

142
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,501
They don't let just anyone
take a level test for that class.

143
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,420
-What are we doing right now?
-Just follow me.

144
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,089
Soo-bin wants to be in Mr. Son's class?

145
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:35,176
Yes. I talked to Mr. Son,

146
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,303
and he said we need your permission.

147
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,892
No. You did the right thing, Soo-bin.

148
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,188
Where are you going, Soo-bin?

149
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,773
Are you looking for Hwi-yeong?

150
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,442
-Where is Hwi-yeong?
-Where is he?

151
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,961
Hwi-yeong.

152
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:13,714
Soo-bin.

153
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,800
Why are you so startled?

154
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,177
I'm not. Let's go.

155
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,095
I...

156
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,057
quit the class.

157
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:24,683
Why?

158
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,061
It didn't feel right.

159
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,522
Please don't tell my mom
for the time being.

160
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,316
Soo-bin.

161
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:35,111
I'm sorry. You went through
so much trouble for me.

162
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:36,904
Please understand me.

163
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,575
By the way...

164
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,371
Never mind.

165
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,541
What is it? Say it.

166
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,463
When Jun-u was hitting you earlier,

167
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,799
why didn't you hit him back?

168
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,014
To me,

169
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,726
it seemed like you were letting him
hit you on purpose.

170
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,440
Who would do that on purpose?

171
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,024
I just couldn't dodge him.

172
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,278
By the way,

173
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,613
why did you...

174
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:24,702
What?

175
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,829
Never mind.

176
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,415
You must have been shocked today.
Go home and get some rest.

177
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,333
I'll talk to Mr. Son.

178
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,419
So come to the next class, okay?

179
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,072
See?

180
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,117
Hello.

181
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:09,663
From what I can tell,
you're not dating Yeong-bae.

182
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,541
Do you have a crush on him?

183
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,960
Who's Yeong-bae?

184
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,963
Park Yeong-bae.
You know, the kid who works here.

185
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,508
That's what everyone calls him here.

186
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,636
You mean Jun-u.

187
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,680
Kiddo, give him up while I'm being nice.

188
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,308
I've already called dibs on Yeong-bae.

189
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,311
Give who up?

190
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,146
It's not like that, lady.

191
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,318
What? Lady?

192
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,655
Hey! I'm not a lady. I was born in 1998!

193
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:47,493
Darn it. You have such
a handsome boyfriend. Don't be so greedy.

194
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,955
More soda, please.

195
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,665
Okay, just a minute.

196
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,583
Two extreme combos, please.

197
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,709
Oh, the extreme combo.

198
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:58,128
Dad, two extreme combos.

199
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,089
-Yes, sir!
-Okay.

200
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,924
Okay. Here's your soda.

201
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,426
Have a good night!

202
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,803
-Bye.
-Come again.

203
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,763
-I'll be waiting!
-Bye.

204
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:13,519
O-je.

205
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:15,813
Da-huin.

206
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,648
Are you really going to do this?

207
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,066
You keep ignoring my texts.

208
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,235
You won't call me or take my calls.

209
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,863
What kind of boyfriend does that?

210
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,241
It's been pretty hectic today.

211
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,119
-Sorry.
-O-je!

212
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,495
-Yes.
-The extreme combos.

213
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,247
-Here you go.
-Father.

214
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,249
It's nice to meet you.

215
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,127
Who...

216
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:42,256
I'm O-je's girlfriend, Kwon Da-huin.

217
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:43,883
It's nice to meet you.

218
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,050
Girlfriend?

219
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,803
O-je has a girlfriend?

220
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,138
Of course.

221
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,931
It's our third day already.

222
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,309
Should I serve this now?

223
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,603
Yes, over there.

224
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,316
O-je.

225
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,113
Enjoy.

226
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,157
You punk.

227
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,201
Why didn't you tell me
you had a girlfriend?

228
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,704
She's so pretty too.

229
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,205
She's not.

230
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,999
-She's not, what?
-She's not.

231
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,792
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

232
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:19,919
Welcome.

233
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,754
That way, please.

234
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,383
Hi, Jun-u. Are you going home?

235
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,599
Who is it?

236
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,352
Your name is Geon-hyeok, right?

237
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,896
Why did you tell Jun-u

238
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,815
that a kid in my class paid you guys?

239
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:44,985
Why?

240
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,946
So that Jun-u wouldn't get the wrong idea.

241
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,157
Jeong-hu didn't die because of us.

242
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,829
Yes, he quit school and left...

243
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,208
because we bullied him, but...

244
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,127
he got into a car accident
while going home from work.

245
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,589
I already got into so much trouble.
That's why I'm in here.

246
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,967
If that gets tacked on as well, I'm dead.

247
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:12,471
Is it true that a student from my class
gave you money?

248
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,182
Yes, but it wasn't much.

249
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:18,268
Gi-tae, that bastard.
We asked him to give us money,

250
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,354
and he got scared and gave it to us.

251
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:21,647
I see.

252
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,778
Still, I'd like you to testify
to what you did do wrong.

253
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,405
Please do that.

254
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,619
You can say exactly what you saw, right?

255
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,292
Yes.

256
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,545
Okay.

257
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,214
Thank you, Geon-hyeok.

258
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,757
Thank you.

259
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,761
-Really?
-That's right.

260
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,764
Geon-hyeok promised me that he'd do it.

261
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,182
I informed the school too.

262
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,101
Let's all get together tomorrow,

263
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,229
hear the whole story
and figure it all out.

264
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:07,276
I think Gi-tae must have had
his reasons for doing that.

265
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,320
Don't be too upset, kid.

266
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,156
Okay.

267
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,700
Thank you.

268
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,745
You're thankful, right?
See? Things work out.

269
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:22,166
Life isn't completely unfair, okay?

270
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,044
Let's change things up.

271
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,046
I'll see you tomorrow.

272
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,923
Okay.

273
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,725
You said you'd take responsibility
if there's any problem.

274
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,643
That depends on the problem. Did I--

275
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,729
Did I tell you to pay them?

276
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,407
So-ye, please answer my calls. Please?

277
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,790
God, you scared me.

278
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,217
That's ridiculous.

279
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,762
Did they say
I paid them to get you expelled?

280
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,765
It wasn't you.

281
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,975
Hwi-yeong made you do it.

282
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:27,731
That's probably why he was
looking for you so desperately.

283
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,193
It's true that I paid them.
The truth is...

284
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,446
my little brother is a troublemaker.

285
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,116
He got into an argument with them
while playing a game together,

286
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,368
and they got into a scuffle.

287
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,621
I met them to take care of that.

288
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,289
Gi-tae.

289
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,292
You know, right?

290
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:51,004
That Hwi-yeong will weasel out of this,

291
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,423
and that you will take the fall
for the whole thing.

292
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,303
Just tell the truth tomorrow

293
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,807
-that Hwi-yeong made you do it.
-He had nothing to do with it.

294
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,517
I just...

295
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,700
My friend died because of you guys.

296
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,370
If you cover for Hwi-yeong,

297
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,248
do you think he'll have your back?

298
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,086
Why are you so loyal to him?

299
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,256
Isn't it so he'll help you
get into a good college?

300
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,096
Gi-tae.

301
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,390
Do the right thing.

302
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,351
Or you'll regret it later.

303
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,448
Jun-u.

304
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,830
I'm sorry.

305
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,250
I'm sorry, Jun-u.

306
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,170
I'm sorry, Jun-u.

307
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,589
I'll get on my knees.

308
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,010
Can't you forgive me
just this once? Please?

309
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,846
Can't you just let it slide
just this once?

310
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,098
Jun-u, I'm really sorry.

311
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:28,268
Please be understanding
and let it slide just this once.

312
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:33,232
Your life is already ruined,
but mine is different.

313
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,612
I've been doing well until now.

314
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,241
I've worked really hard.

315
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,202
My mom and dad...

316
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,537
They have high expectations of me.

317
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:51,124
I'm the only one in my family
who can make it to college.

318
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,626
Please.

319
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,254
Please.

320
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:57,714
Please.

321
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,444
Gi-tae.

322
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:25,117
No life is "already ruined."

323
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,121
We're only 18.

324
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,165
Both you

325
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:33,875
and me.

326
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,465
And Jeong-hu.

327
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:47,306
I have faith that you have a conscience.

328
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:18,462
Don't worry.

329
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,214
I won't tell the others
that you and Gi-tae are going out.

330
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,925
I heard everything...

331
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,094
you and Gi-tae said.

332
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:27,929
What?

333
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,973
I won't tell the others either.

334
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:31,850
But...

335
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,853
make sure nothing happens to Gi-tae.

336
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,772
Like what?

337
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,232
If anything happens to him,

338
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,026
I won't...

339
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,195
just stand by.

340
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,003
Son, you're home.

341
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,135
Son.

342
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,180
What's wrong with your face?

343
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,808
Who did this to you?

344
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,976
Are you okay? Let's go to the hospital.

345
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,145
We need to get a medical certificate.
Let's go.

346
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,271
Mom.

347
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:23,193
-Dad's not home yet, right?
-No, he's running late.

348
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,947
You're lucky he's coming late.
What in the world is this?

349
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,740
Come on, let's go to the hospital.

350
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:29,866
Mom.

351
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,829
Help me.

352
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,755
LEE GI-TAE

353
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,712
Jun-u, are you home?

354
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,213
Are you okay?

355
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,886
Of course, he's not okay.

356
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,983
Mom.

357
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,573
I was so worried about you.

358
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,201
So I thought I should be with you today.

359
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,587
The house is a total mess.
You should've cleaned.

360
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,714
Goodness, look at your desk.

361
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,018
-Do you want some?
-No, it's okay.

362
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,105
Jun-u!

363
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,691
I bought two.

364
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,568
I peeled mine like this.

365
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,281
-This is delicious.
-It really is.

366
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:45,961
Jun-u.

367
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,675
Jun-u.

368
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,760
I'll go buy some water.

369
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,347
But we have water.

370
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,392
What is wrong with him?

371
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,883
Jun-u will be here today, right?

372
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:15,925
He probably will.

373
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,761
He called O-je yesterday.

374
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,804
-He asked where Gi-tae lived.
-Da-huin.

375
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,641
Good morning.

376
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,769
Why did Jun-u ask where Gi-tae lived?

377
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:30,273
My god. The newbie got himself
into some serious trouble.

378
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,858
It's beyond our imagination.

379
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:34,027
How could he even think
of hitting Hwi-yeong?

380
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,279
I guess he doesn't care about
his school life at all.

381
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:37,989
He has some guts, that's for sure.

382
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,075
Pil-sang, where did you hear that?

383
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:42,660
I was called to the teacher's office
just now.

384
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,204
I happened to overhear

385
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,998
the vice-principal scolding Jun-u.

386
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:50,418
"How could you hit Hwi-yeong?

387
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:54,214
He went to the funeral hall
to comfort you.

388
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,507
-You punk..."
-Pil-sang.

389
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,717
-What?
-Be quiet.

390
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:00,095
-She's telling you to be quiet.
-Is it true?

391
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:03,223
Is that why Hwi-yeong didn't come
today? Is he hurt?

392
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:04,933
It's not that bad.

393
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,309
Did you know about it?

394
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:09,771
Gi-tae, they want you to come
to the counseling room.

395
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,023
What? Why is Gi-tae being summoned?

396
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:14,275
I got it.

397
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,945
Lee Gi-tae, Ma Hwi-yeong, Choe Jun-u.

398
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:20,073
There must be a big incident involving
these three that we don't know about.

399
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:22,200
What do you mean,
an incident we don't know about?

400
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:24,536
It's just because Gi-tae is
Hwi-yeong's best friend.

401
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,704
No, his best friend is Soo-bin.

402
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,081
Pil-sang, go take your seat.

403
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,876
Hwi-yeong,
is it really true Jun-u hit you?

404
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,586
-It doesn't look that bad.
-Hey. Pil-sang.

405
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,587
What?

406
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,464
I'm so curious about what happened.

407
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,801
Hwi-yeong, is it true?

408
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:42,804
You think Jun-u's a gangster?

409
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,264
Why would he hit me for no reason?

410
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:45,724
Let's quiet down and study.

411
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,234
Of course, Jun-u is a gangster.

412
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:59,320
Why can't we call a gangster
a gangster? This is so messed up.

413
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,322
Hwi-yeong's just trying to play it cool.

414
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,199
I know. He's not even good at fighting.

415
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,636
-Hwi-yeong.
-Oh, no.

416
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,638
-My gosh. Are you okay?
-Jun-u.

417
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,474
-Yes.
-Your mom called me this morning.

418
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,267
Do you know how surprised I was?

419
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,810
I'm okay, sir.

420
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,313
-Go on inside.
-Okay.

421
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:47,577
Mr. Oh, you're not the homeroom teacher
of Class Three now.

422
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,663
You shouldn't join us for today's meeting.

423
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:53,625
Wait. But I was the one

424
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,169
who reported to you about this incident,

425
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:59,422
and I even talked to the students
from Byeongmun High School.

426
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:00,924
As the assistant teacher.

427
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:03,343
Yes, good job.

428
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:04,552
But...

429
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:08,848
the homeroom teacher of Class Three
will be returning soon.

430
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:12,435
I believe you should clear out
his space before his return. Bye.

431
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,521
But still, sir...

432
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,151
Mr. Lee?

433
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,129
It's taking longer than I thought.

434
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,632
What is going on?

435
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:56,062
Why is it taking so long?

436
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:04,779
Geon-hyeok, can you repeat
what you said to Jun-u?

437
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,993
Detective. I heard Lee Gi-tae

438
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:12,078
gave Geon-hyeok and his friends money.

439
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:13,746
Can you ask him if it's true?

440
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:18,001
We heard Lee Gi-tae paid you
and your friends. Is that true?

441
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:21,504
Geon-hyeok?

442
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:24,924
I didn't receive any money.

443
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:31,222
Then is it true
that you tried to lure Jun-u

444
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,099
into a fight

445
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:36,936
and get him expelled from school?

446
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,611
No.

447
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,905
That's odd...

448
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,257
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

449
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:08,676
He is

450
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,595
a transfer student.

451
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,904
My mom took care of everything.

452
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:33,201
Thanks. Thanks, Hwi-yeong.

453
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,036
Did you really think I'd abandon you?

454
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,706
Earlier, I was just so upset.
You understand that, right?

455
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,417
Of course, I do.

456
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,629
You're the friend I trust the most.

457
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:01,437
See? Things work out.

458
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:04,941
Life isn't completely unfair, okay?

459
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,652
Let's change things up.

460
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,570
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Okay.

461
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,908
Why does he sound so hopeless?

462
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:48,484
You stupid idiot.
You're worse than the kids.

463
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:53,156
Do you call yourself a teacher?
A grown-up?

464
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:55,742
You worthless...

465
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,119
Are you even a teacher?

466
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,249
Jun-u.

467
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,753
Your closest friend just died.

468
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:09,005
You must be so heartbroken and angry.

469
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,215
That day,

470
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:14,719
you must have wanted to relieve
your extreme stress at the moment

471
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:18,598
as a means of self-defense,
to protect yourself.

472
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:22,268
In such a situation,
it is hard to control yourself,

473
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:26,147
which can lead to an impulsive
display of violence and aggression.

474
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,524
It can happen to anyone.

475
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:31,778
Even I have been in that situation.

476
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:36,074
That's why I don't believe
your violent behavior defines you.

477
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,868
During adolescence...

478
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,222
It went well.

479
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,767
That's a relief.

480
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,686
You're lucky
that your dad didn't find out.

481
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,481
This should never happen again. Ever.

482
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,441
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

483
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,819
I'm sorry, Mom.

484
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:25,289
HOW DID HE GO
FROM A REGULAR EMPLOYEE TO A CEO?

485
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:39,679
Hwi-yeong.

486
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,350
-Mr. Oh.
-I heard how the meeting went.

487
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,937
Jun-u got the wrong idea
about you and Gi-tae.

488
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,021
Yes.

489
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:50,731
He's wrong, right?

490
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:52,775
Of course.

491
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,734
Right.

492
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:57,280
There's no way you would have lied.

493
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,240
Hwi-yeong.

494
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,202
Well... I want to apologize.

495
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,454
Now that I look back,

496
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:09,500
I think I was seeing the situation
only from Jun-u's perspective.

497
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:13,963
I must have felt sorry
for what Jun-u was going through.

498
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,882
But you're my student too.

499
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,012
I'm sorry I suspected you
even for a short while.

500
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,890
It's okay. Jun-u is disadvantaged here.

501
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,642
You just wanted to be
on the side of the disadvantaged.

502
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,519
It's understandable.

503
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,231
Thank you for everything.

504
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:37,945
"Disadvantaged."

505
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:41,616
Did you have lunch?

506
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,745
I hope I didn't apologize to you
for no reason.

507
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:47,580
I really do.

508
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,128
You must be so relieved now.

509
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,131
Isn't it so nice? Whether you're
a homeroom teacher or just an assistant,

510
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,175
taking charge of a class is such a hassle.

511
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,514
That's not what I mean.

512
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,808
-Mr. Oh.
-Sir, listen.

513
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:19,195
I mean, you can't say that now.

514
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:20,738
Don't you think?

515
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:24,200
Hey. No. You...

516
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,035
Mr. Oh!

517
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:28,871
Hold on. No. Just a second.

518
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,790
Mr. Oh. Let's...

519
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,083
Mr. Oh.

520
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,834
Mr. Oh.

521
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:36,837
What was that?

522
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:40,258
As a means of self-defense,

523
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,551
Choe Jun-u acted violently out of anger?

524
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:43,803
Is that what the teachers said?

525
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,765
Well, it's what they're guessing,
at least.

526
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,726
I don't know.
They kept using big words like that.

527
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:54,855
How did Jun-u react?
Didn't he try to smash anything?

528
00:37:56,524 --> 00:38:00,278
He looked blank.
As if he didn't care about anything.

529
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,196
Has he completely given up?

530
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,157
What is he going to do now?

531
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,118
He totally got on the wrong side
of the teachers.

532
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,205
O-je said Jun-u's a good kid, though.

533
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,375
Gosh, he must have completely given up.

534
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,877
Where are you going?

535
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,212
Where are you going?

536
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,902
If you're here to ask me
if I'm okay, don't. I'm not.

537
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,906
I'm not here to ask you that.

538
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,748
Something happened
between you and Hwi-yeong, right?

539
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,791
That's why

540
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,586
you beat him up
at the funeral hall, right?

541
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,673
Were you upset that I beat up Hwi-yeong?

542
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,634
You're his girlfriend, after all.

543
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,599
How could you say that?

544
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:16,062
Even though I might not be able
to be of much help,

545
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,105
I wanted to help
in case you were treated unfairly.

546
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,690
Why would you help me?

547
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,069
Out of pity?

548
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:28,032
I was forced to transfer
and keep getting in trouble.

549
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,702
And I just lost my only friend.
Is that why?

550
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,330
It's not out of pity.

551
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:35,414
Cut it out.

552
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,043
I don't need
a sheltered kid like you pitying me.

553
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,129
I'm fine.

554
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,177
I've been holding back
my anger well all this time.

555
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,096
And why am I taking it out on her now?

556
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,142
To be honest,

557
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,479
I just wanted to see you.

558
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:00,856
I don't know why.

559
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:06,112
If I made you even angrier, I'm sorry.

560
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,976
Oh, my. I have some shocking news.

561
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,854
Oh Han-gyeol quit.

562
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,440
-What?
-Seriously?

563
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,150
-Why?
-Really?

564
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,112
Yes. I heard he quit.

565
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,238
So suddenly?

566
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,407
Pil-sang, will you sit down?

567
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:52,575
Hwi-yeong.

568
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,035
Did Mr. Oh really quit?

569
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,164
Yes. I don't know exactly what happened,

570
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,957
but something must have come up.

571
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,085
And our homeroom teacher got sick again
and went back to the hospital.

572
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:06,630
It'll be a while before we get
a new homeroom teacher.

573
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:07,965
The midterm's next week.

574
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:09,341
I knew something didn't feel right.

575
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,844
I'll post which chapters will be
on the exam on our online community.

576
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:16,265
I'll also upload summaries
of each subject, so you can use them.

577
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:19,101
-That'd be great.
-You're the best.

578
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,687
-You're amazing.
-Nice.

579
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:22,771
I love you.

580
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,482
I don't need it.

581
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,942
I hope you all will get
good grades this time.

582
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,153
The summaries are only to be shared
within our class.

583
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,488
Of course.

584
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:34,116
If we share them with friends outside
the class, it'll only hurt us.

585
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,577
-That's right.
-Ro-mi is always right.

586
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,661
Mr. Oh!

587
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,747
-What happened?
-What?

588
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,081
Mr. Oh.

589
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:44,084
-Please continue.
-I'm done. You can say goodbye.

590
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,545
Mr. Oh, what happened?

591
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,088
Are you really quitting?

592
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,381
That's not fair!

593
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:52,176
Can't you at least stay
until the homeroom teacher comes back?

594
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,637
-Stay until then!
-That's right!

595
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,848
-Please stay!
-Stay!

596
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:01,060
Guys, you're just making him feel bad.

597
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:03,020
Let's not say anything about it.

598
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,855
Thank you for everything, Mr. Oh.

599
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:07,233
Please give us some nice parting words.

600
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,151
Sure. Okay.

601
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:13,239
What I want to say is...

602
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:18,118
Jun-u. Are you leaving?

603
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:20,454
I don't need to tell you, do I?

604
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,122
You're not our teacher anymore.

605
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,210
Jun-u.

606
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,336
Hey, you.

607
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:30,339
Just hear me out, okay?

608
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,845
These aren't parting words!

609
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:41,058
I mean, I was just going to quit,

610
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,394
but I changed my mind.

611
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:46,105
You guys kind of grew on me too.

612
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:47,815
And...

613
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:49,900
And...

614
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,487
it's really hard to get a job these days.

615
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:56,699
Plus, it's a very secure job.

616
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,076
That's his true self.

617
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:01,036
Seriously. I can't believe we fell for it.

618
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,330
And one more thing.

619
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,501
From this moment forth,

620
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:13,382
the official homeroom teacher
for Class Three of the second grade,

621
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,886
is me, Oh Han-gyeol.
It's nice to meet you!

622
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:23,517
Mr. Oh. Are you
our real homeroom teacher now?

623
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,394
Was I a fake before?

624
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,282
Applause!

625
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:41,452
Yes! Awesome!

626
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:49,835
CLASS THREE, MR. KIM

627
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:50,961
What?

628
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,380
Hello?

629
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,341
Mr. Oh. Mr. Oh Han-gyeol!

630
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:57,384
Stop. Stop for a minute.

631
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,429
Gosh. I said to stop. I got you.

632
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:04,391
You said I should take my hands off it.

633
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,727
So I'm taking my hands

634
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,813
-off everything.
-Hey. Hold on.

635
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,317
Please stay
until we get a temp to fill in.

636
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:17,946
Class Three's homeroom teacher
is going back to the hospital.

637
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,615
Help me out here.

638
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:20,824
Oh, right.

639
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:23,035
I'm sorry. I apologize.

640
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:24,578
I'm sorry too. I apologize.

641
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,121
Mr. Oh.

642
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:30,417
Be the assistant teacher
until we get a new homeroom teacher.

643
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:34,922
No. I will not be an assistant teacher.

644
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,924
Mr. Oh. Please.

645
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:38,509
Make me

646
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:40,886
their homeroom teacher.

647
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,847
Awesome!

648
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,849
My gosh. Keep it down.

649
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:53,065
Hwi-yeong. Gi-tae.

650
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:53,982
Yes?

651
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:58,779
I am now your homeroom teacher.

652
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:01,073
So I wanted to make things clear.

653
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,959
I'll keep my eye on you.

654
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,254
You understand, right?

655
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:18,132
Sure.

656
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:24,513
Okay. Looking forward to it.

657
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:35,149
SEOUL JUVENILE
CLASSIFICATION REVIEW CENTER

658
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,321
Jun-u.

659
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:43,407
Are you going to work?

660
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,536
It must be hard for you
especially with exams coming up.

661
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:50,831
Gi-tae.

662
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:53,625
Are you happy now?

663
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,878
Since your life wasn't ruined?

664
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:59,339
-What does he mean?
-You're so random.

665
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,716
What's his problem?

666
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,134
Let's go.

667
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,521
Jun-u.

668
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:33,874
We had a nice funeral for Jeong-hu.

669
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,294
That punk Jeong-hu

670
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,047
was grateful to you guys

671
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:44,259
for eating with him at school.

672
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,060
Whether to eat alone or with someone,
it's a big deal for kids like us.

673
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:56,688
Because he and I grew up
pretty much on our own.

674
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:02,653
Because we've lived floating around
here and there like a ball of dust.

675
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:08,659
I'm going back.

676
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:10,702
Geon-hyeok.

677
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:16,542
Take care of yourself.

678
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:32,349
Jun-u.

679
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,560
Did you have a nice talk?

680
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:36,478
Yes.

681
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,064
You're glad you met up, right?

682
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:47,573
You didn't believe me, did you?

683
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:50,492
When I called you the other day,
all excited.

684
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:53,620
How humiliating.

685
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,207
Why? That's your charm.

686
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,085
-You're naive.
-What?

687
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:03,630
Listen. I have a new goal after that day.

688
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:07,926
To become a teacher
that Choe Jun-u trusts completely.

689
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:11,138
I trust you.

690
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,472
Don't lie to me.

691
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:17,269
It's written all over your face.
"I don't trust Oh Han-gyeol at all."

692
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:20,147
Don't touch my hair.
You'll mess up my style.

693
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:21,273
Your style.

694
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,901
It's written here too
that you don't trust me.

695
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,695
You punk, ordering your teacher around.

696
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,995
Thank you for coming with me.

697
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:38,874
Jun-u.

698
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:43,629
Now, forget everything that's happened,

699
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,298
and let's start over together. Okay?

700
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:50,093
Let's cast aside depression,
self-blame, things like that.

701
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:52,638
Okay.

702
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:56,933
Your heart sank when I said
I was leaving earlier, right?

703
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:58,810
No.

704
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,729
You were tearing up.

705
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:02,689
I saw it. You were tearing up.

706
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:03,815
I was not.

707
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,859
You weren't? No?

708
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,755
I washed it. Thanks.

709
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:30,133
To be honest, I just wanted to see you.

710
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:44,481
-No!
-That's not it!

711
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:47,067
-I swear.
-I'm going to...

712
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,360
-No.
-Don't hit him!

713
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:49,444
Quiet!

714
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,825
-No.
-Just once.

715
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,021
Why would you help me?

716
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,481
Out of pity?

717
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:46,752
SOO-BIN

718
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:00,098
Yoo Soo-bin.

719
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:03,894
Sorry.

720
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:21,620
-Let me help with that.
-No, It's okay.

721
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:22,662
Give it to me.

722
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,046
Bye.

723
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:32,714
I'll win tomorrow.

724
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,174
I played some basketball.

725
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:37,093
Guys, this is a supplemental reading
material for Social Studies.

726
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:39,554
Pick up your notebooks yourselves,

727
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,473
and take one and pass it back.

728
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,988
You know the test is
just around the corner, right?

729
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,741
To prepare for the test
more efficiently, let's change seats.

730
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,159
Check your group chat message.

731
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:07,666
NEW SEATING ARRANGEMENT FOR CLASS 3

732
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,210
Come on, what is this?

733
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:13,255
You placed everyone with poor grades
in the back of the class.

734
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:14,506
That's not true.

735
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:17,551
I gathered study group members
close together, so it may seem that way.

736
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:18,593
That's the same thing.

737
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,720
Those of you who were
my classmates last year

738
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,305
know how efficient this is.

739
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:26,184
He's right. Our grades improved
a lot back then.

740
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,062
Let's change seats then.

741
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:32,899
Hwi-yeong, is this really necessary?

742
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,403
Our class voted early this semester

743
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,822
to follow my decisions
regarding seating arrangements.

744
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:40,365
I hope you cooperate.

745
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:41,783
Yes, sir.

746
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,453
Did everyone agree with changing seats?

747
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:50,250
Well, Soo-bin, me, Chan-yeol,

748
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,127
and everyone I know were against it,

749
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:54,170
but he still received
a majority of the votes.

750
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,673
If we arrange the seats like that,

751
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:59,342
we can help each other study,

752
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,386
so those with good grades
all agreed to it.

753
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:11,146
It's time for the end of day
announcements. Let's...

754
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:19,988
What happened to your seats?

755
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:23,241
Since the midterm is coming up soon.
We changed seats.

756
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:27,746
Without even discussing it with
your homeroom teacher? Which is me.

757
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:30,832
We always changed seats freely like this.

758
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:33,293
We did it for the last mock exam too.

759
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,045
Oh, I see.

760
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,634
I said we have a supplementary
English class today, right?

761
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:43,345
Let's begin in 20 minutes
in this classroom.

762
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,556
Sir, we can't attend
the supplementary class.

763
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,891
We have a study group session.

764
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,770
You won't attend the class
due to your study group?

765
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:53,355
Since it's not a regular class.

766
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,982
Oh, since it's not a regular class?

767
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:01,196
Then who doesn't want to
attend the supplementary class?

768
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:06,785
Are you guys in the group too?

769
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:08,995
No. We're going to study on our own.

770
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,372
Us too.

771
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:12,123
Hands down.

772
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,294
Sir, we'll stay
for the supplementary English class.

773
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:19,255
-Me too.
-Me too.

774
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:21,341
-Me too.
-I'll stay for it too.

775
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:23,593
Okay, then.

776
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:32,769
Jun-u...

777
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:36,940
I guess Jun-u really gave up
on studying, right?

778
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:46,116
Mr. Oh, I can't yield this to you.

779
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:47,867
It's a matter of our grades.

780
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:50,912
"Yield"?

781
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:56,376
Do you come to school
to yield things to me?

782
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:59,045
No, that's not what I meant.

783
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:03,675
Then does it mean you yielded
by accepting a pitiful person like me

784
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:05,343
as your homeroom teacher?

785
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:08,346
If I lashed back at you like this,

786
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,224
it would be like admitting
my ego has hit rock bottom.

787
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:20,608
Change your seats back to the way
they were.

788
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:24,904
And make sure your study group sessions
don't overlap with my classes.

789
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:25,947
Got it?

790
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:42,422
Lord, Buddha,

791
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,299
Grandma...

792
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,344
I should believe in a religion.

793
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:49,429
Mr. Oh.

794
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:52,265
Why don't you find some students
to keep an eye on him for you?

795
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,161
Thanks.

796
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,331
Here.

797
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:22,629
Jun-u.

798
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,217
I want to join this study group too.

799
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:32,597
Too bad.

800
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:36,351
You have to be at a certain level
to join this group.

801
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:38,728
Oh, if you need help with your studies,

802
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,313
I can help you later one-on-one.

803
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,024
You're lucky, Jun-u.

804
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:50,657
A certain level?
Do you think I'm not good enough?

805
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:52,408
Why do you think so?

806
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:00,500
I'm sorry if you were offended.
You can join us then.

807
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:03,670
Since it's your first time,
you can sit in the front.

808
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:08,133
I guess I can't.

809
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,136
I need to go to work.

810
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,139
Sorry to bother you.

811
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:19,602
See you, Jun-u.

812
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,271
But...

813
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,817
Why do you do this?

814
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:27,944
What?

815
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:30,113
Aren't you busy enough studying alone?

816
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:32,073
To remain at the top of our year?

817
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:38,204
-That's...
-Hwi-yeong is always like this.

818
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,248
He helps us and supports us.

819
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:47,046
He wants all of us to turn out well.
It's something like that.

820
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,048
Oh, really?

821
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,760
I see.

822
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:56,431
It must be tough being you.

823
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:22,749
As you can see, gerunds
and present participles

824
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:25,877
can be distinguished
by a verb plus "ing"...

825
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:31,341
-Hello.
-Yes.

826
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:33,218
I'm sorry. Can I speak to Soo-bin?

827
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:36,554
-Hello.
-Hello, ma'am.

828
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,723
-Soo-bin.
-Ma'am, what is this about?

829
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:41,434
Something urgent came up.
Please continue with your class.

830
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,526
I was in the middle of the class.

831
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:53,404
Did you

832
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:56,407
quit Mr. Son's class?

833
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:00,036
You've lost your mind.

834
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,373
Follow me.

835
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:07,502
Come here.

836
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:18,721
Yoo Soo-bin. Are you crazy?
Have you really lost your mind?

837
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:21,474
Don't you know how much
I kissed up to Hwi-yeong's mom?

838
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,685
Didn't you see me act
like a servant around her?

839
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:26,020
But you quit the academy
without even discussing it with me?

840
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:27,772
What for... Why?

841
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:31,693
How could you suddenly barge in
like that? It's embarrassing.

842
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:33,653
Embarrassing? Are you embarrassed?

843
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:36,406
Look who's talking. I'm the one
who's embarrassed because of you.

844
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:38,783
I'm so embarrassed that
I can't even attend my alumni reunion.

845
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:41,828
My friends' children all attend science,
private and foreign language high schools.

846
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:44,956
Or they're top of their year
at regular high schools, at least.

847
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:46,583
They have no trouble getting into SNU.

848
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:49,502
But what about you?
Do you have anything to be proud of?

849
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:52,672
So I'm struggling so hard
to get you into Seoul National University.

850
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:55,008
But what is the matter with you?

851
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:59,345
Did you get married to attend
an alumni reunion?

852
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:02,515
Did you give birth to me
just to brag to others?

853
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,642
Then why don't you just
get rid of me right now?

854
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:06,603
Go adopt a smart kid
that's good at studying.

855
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:07,895
Why are you tormenting me?

856
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:09,731
What, you brat? What did you just say?

857
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:11,357
Say that again.

858
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:14,402
Keep going. Say that again, you brat.

859
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:15,987
I won't make it to SNU.

860
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:19,365
Even if you bring a more
talented teacher than Mr. Son,

861
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,534
I can never make it. It's impossible.

862
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:24,162
I'll be glad if I can make it
to any university in Seoul.

863
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:26,205
Even I know this so well.

864
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:29,667
Why can't someone who's so smart
and graduated from SNU like you, see that?

865
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:32,545
Go. Go do what you want.

866
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,297
Go and live as you please now.

867
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,799
Get out of my house.
I don't need a daughter like you.

868
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,551
I don't need a daughter like you. Go!

869
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:41,929
Did you think I wouldn't go?

870
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:44,682
Thank you for letting me live as I please.

871
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:47,602
Hey, come back here.

872
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:49,687
Yoo Soo-bin. Come back here.

873
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,564
Hey, Yoo Soo-bin. Come back!

874
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:52,649
Hey!

875
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:38,528
So what is the role
of a present participle?

876
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:40,613
-Moon Chan-yeol?
-Yes?

877
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,408
You don't seem to know anything...

878
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:46,953
Soo-bin.

879
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:51,416
-Are you okay?
-Yes. I'm sorry.

880
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:55,253
Mr. Oh, I'm sorry,
but can I leave class early?

881
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:56,462
-Soo-bin.
-Well...

882
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:57,922
Okay. You can do that.

883
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:07,724
All right. See you tomorrow.

884
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,684
Soo-bin. I'll call you.

885
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:45,136
Just go.

886
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:46,721
I don't want to fight with you right now.

887
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:02,653
Go.

888
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:05,990
I'm going.

889
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:12,038
Are you okay?

890
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:19,629
Isn't that

891
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:21,756
what I usually say?

892
01:03:25,092 --> 01:03:26,052
You're right.

893
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:30,807
But can't I say it?

894
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:35,436
I'm worried about you.

895
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,982
I saw your mom earlier.

896
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:46,489
I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but...

897
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:50,576
So, now you know.

898
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:53,663
My life hasn't been as easy as you think.

899
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:57,291
You're not the only one who has suffered.

900
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:00,837
I guess so.

901
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:16,310
Well...

902
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:21,399
-I'm sorry about yesterday...
-Can you just go?

903
01:04:22,316 --> 01:04:23,317
What?

904
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:26,779
I want to be alone.

905
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:55,558
By the way...

906
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:58,102
Why do you never apologize?

907
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:05,151
-Just now, I tried to...
-Also,

908
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,069
I'm not Hwi-yeong's girlfriend.

909
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:16,120
And why do I want to help you?

910
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:18,873
Is it out of pity?

911
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:26,589
I know it isn't. That's why I...

912
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:29,175
It's because I like you. What are you...

913
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:32,303
going to do now?

914
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:53,491
Hey! Jun-u!

915
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:17,765
Are you really...

916
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,939
Soo-bin. Seriously...

917
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:27,608
I'm not going home today.

918
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:29,276
It's dangerous to walk alone at night.

919
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,778
Soo-bin is at Chan-yeol's place.

920
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:33,990
I just wanted to ask a few things
about the kids of Class Three.

921
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:36,117
That day, what exactly happened?

922
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,702
He's done that a few times before too.

923
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:40,371
I'll make sure Hwi-yeong
doesn't get the highest grades here.

924
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:42,331
So this is the issue you have.

925
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:44,083
Jealousy. Anxiety.

926
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,501
Do you think that'll humiliate me?

927
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:49,005
I'll make you feel sorry
for those you've looked down on.

928
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:52,758
-Soo-bin. Oh, no.
-Oh, my god.

929
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:53,968
I'll carry her.

930
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:04,979
