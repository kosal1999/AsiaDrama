1
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,522
What are you guys doing?

2
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,415
So your girlfriend is Soo-bin?

3
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,504
-Well...
-Mom.

4
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,424
I was going to tell you
after the final exams--

5
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,134
Soo-bin.

6
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,763
What is this now?

7
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,057
What is happening here?

8
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,059
What are you two doing?

9
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,769
Don't touch her!

10
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,313
What is this?

11
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,649
What on earth is happening?

12
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,944
What are you thinking?

13
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,423
Mom.

14
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,136
Go home.

15
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,189
I'll be downstairs.

16
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,067
Go home. Just go.

17
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,195
I told you to go home!

18
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,210
Sit down.

19
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:21,367
Can I ask you something?

20
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,286
Yes.

21
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,041
Did you...

22
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,713
sleep with Soo-bin?

23
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,592
Be honest with me.

24
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,971
Only then can we prepare
for the worst-case scenario...

25
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,974
as soon as possible.

26
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:46,976
Right?

27
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,646
Did you?

28
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,157
That...

29
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,661
never happened.

30
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,249
Thanks.

31
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,709
Thanks for not being immature.

32
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,672
You probably know
what I'm going to say to you.

33
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,592
Don't go out with Soo-bin.

34
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,970
Don't even talk to her from now on.

35
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,430
Yes, just pretend you don't know her.

36
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,058
Nothing happened between you two, right?

37
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,145
Nothing whatsoever happened
between you, right?

38
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,606
Hey, Soo-bin is not a girl

39
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,485
someone like you can go out with...

40
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:40,863
Jun-u.

41
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,658
Your mom is such a good person.

42
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,662
You're probably a good person as well.

43
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,290
I'm sure of it. Right, Jun-u?

44
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,833
Jun-u.

45
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,294
Yes.

46
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,339
Jun-u, I beg you.

47
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,216
Please?

48
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,654
Mom.

49
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,158
Mom.

50
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,456
He said he won't go out with you anymore.

51
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,624
He promised me.

52
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,754
This is it.

53
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,547
Okay?

54
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,673
Come down.

55
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,360
Soo-bin, are you all right?

56
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,407
Tell your mom that you're sorry.

57
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,325
I'm fine.

58
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,749
You don't have to give them up
if you don't want to.

59
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:40,960
Keep them.

60
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,964
But if you do that,
I'll pack up and leave.

61
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,550
I'll quit my job too.

62
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,343
I'll quit everything.

63
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,221
Once I decide to do something,
I always do it.

64
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,056
I don't need these things.

65
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,064
Go study.

66
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,277
Mom.

67
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:08,696
Yes.

68
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,240
Is it that wrong...

69
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,452
that I'm going out with Jun-u?

70
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:15,786
Yes.

71
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,580
Why is it wrong?

72
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,212
Because you're my everything.

73
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:25,630
You're...

74
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,432
Because you're my everything,

75
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:41,145
and I cherish you even more than myself.

76
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,564
You're the last bit of pride
that I have left.

77
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,817
And you're going out
with a boy like that...

78
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,490
I can't even believe that my daughter

79
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,492
hung out with a punk like him.

80
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,077
Does that answer your question?

81
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,580
Had I gone out with someone else,

82
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,916
would you have been okay with it?

83
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:09,173
Take them. Just take them
if you don't want to give them up.

84
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,633
Suit yourself.

85
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,718
Do whatever you want if you don't need me.

86
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,515
I'll go study.

87
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,770
-Mom.
-Yes.

88
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,022
Your threats...

89
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,612
Forget it.

90
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,625
Mom, I wanted to tell you
that I'm not obeying you

91
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:49,088
because I'm afraid something bad
might happen to you or you might walk out

92
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:53,593
of my life, and I wanted to say
I'm sick and tired of your threats.

93
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:58,889
But that might make you
hate Jun-u even more.

94
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:39,180
-Hi, Mom.
-Jun-u, did something happen?

95
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,765
You seem upset.

96
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,808
No, I'm not upset.

97
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,270
Is it because the light is dim?

98
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,814
You must be exhausted
from studying for the final exams.

99
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,941
My poor son.

100
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,152
I can't even be there to look after you.

101
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,863
-Were you washing the dishes?
-Yes.

102
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,782
I'm fine.

103
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,535
-The restaurant is busy, right?
-Yes, of course.

104
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,622
We've been busy. Maybe it's
because of the renovations.

105
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,332
We had a big group earlier.

106
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,918
Twenty people came together.
Isn't it amazing?

107
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,297
All right, Jun-u.
You should get some sleep.

108
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,216
-Okay.
-Great.

109
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,468
Good night. Cheer up!

110
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,196
That...

111
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,366
never happened.

112
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,784
Thanks.

113
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,578
Thanks for not being immature.

114
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,181
Sleep tight, Soo-bin.

115
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,308
Don't think about anything,
and sleep well.

116
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,477
See you tomorrow at school.

117
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,320
Hey, Soo-bin. Say hello.

118
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,031
She'll accompany you everywhere
starting today.

119
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,575
Mom.

120
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:25,369
Wait for her in front of the school gate
around the dismissal time

121
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,037
-and come home together.
-Yes, ma'am.

122
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:30,749
Call me right away if she doesn't
come out by the time I told you.

123
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,421
-I'll let her homeroom teacher know.
-Okay.

124
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,756
And you don't have to go
to the academy from now on.

125
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,508
I'll find a live-in private tutor for you.

126
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,552
But for now, focus on studying
for the exams.

127
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:42,887
Get going.

128
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,473
-Take good care of her, please.
-Of course, ma'am.

129
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:47,808
Mom.

130
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,897
Mom, who is she?

131
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,648
Are you doing this so I can't see Jun-u?

132
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,276
Don't you think this is too much?

133
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,780
-I can take care of myself.
-"I can take care of myself."

134
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,532
You can take care of yourself?

135
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,869
Look what happened
because I believed that.

136
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,913
I don't trust you anymore. Go.

137
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,211
It's been five days since my breakup.

138
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,171
I'm on my way to school.

139
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,382
I'm so hungry that I can't think straight.

140
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,427
But I think I do look
thinner and prettier.

141
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:28,015
-Stop it already.
-What are you doing?

142
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,309
She's been posting videos on the internet.

143
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,311
What's it called?
Da-huin's Breakup Project?

144
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,021
Really? Wait, what's going on?

145
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,314
Soo-bin!

146
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,820
Soo-bin, what's going on?
Are you debuting as a singer?

147
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,531
I knew this would happen.

148
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:44,823
What do you mean?

149
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,326
What else? Her mom must've found out.

150
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:18,607
I bet my beauty that Jun-u will
transfer within a week.

151
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,193
Someone please make her shut up.

152
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,778
Let's go.

153
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,288
Did she find out?

154
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,498
I mean Soo-bin's mom.

155
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,297
You should have listened to my advice.

156
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,383
I didn't want Soo-bin to get hurt.

157
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,472
So what are you going to do now?

158
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,391
What's your plan?

159
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,604
What else can I do?

160
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,233
I'll keep liking Soo-bin.

161
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,322
I didn't have my phone,
so I couldn't talk to you.

162
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,407
Mom took it.

163
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,666
My mom hurt your feelings, right?

164
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,800
Did it hurt a lot?

165
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,349
I should have known better.

166
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,601
I shouldn't have brought you to my place.

167
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:22,648
It's not your fault.
I'm the one who suggested it.

168
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,151
I wanted to see where you live.

169
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,528
Still...

170
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:31,073
You were only trying to comfort me.

171
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,701
I was in a lousy mood
after meeting my dad.

172
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:37,287
I wanted to comfort you,
but I ended up hurting you.

173
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:39,873
Sorry.

174
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,210
Please don't apologize.

175
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,547
Because that really hurts.

176
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,513
Soo-bin.

177
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,267
Let's get through this

178
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,102
even if it's hard.

179
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,565
At a time like this,
we should focus on our school life,

180
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,401
study even harder,

181
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:08,944
and stay cheerful.

182
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:10,988
That's what I'll do.

183
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,240
And I hope you'll do the same.

184
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,205
Jun Dal, you sound so mature.

185
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,755
I'm here for you.

186
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,636
Even if I can't

187
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,514
be of much help to you...

188
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,852
Still, I'm here for you.

189
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,813
I'll always be by your side.

190
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:48,734
You'll always be

191
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,986
the one I like.

192
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,405
No matter how hard it is.

193
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,533
Okay?

194
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,961
Ms. Yoon, I don't think that's...

195
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:11,256
No. I beg you, Mr. Oh.

196
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,594
Please make sure Soo-bin doesn't
hang out with Jun-u.

197
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,889
I was supposed to be at a really
important meeting this morning,

198
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,183
so I thought I'd talk to you on the phone,

199
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,726
but I ran here in the end.

200
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,394
Ms. Yoon.

201
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,979
Jun-u and Soo-bin

202
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:29,483
are in the same class
and have been really good friends.

203
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,610
How could I stop them from hanging out?

204
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,238
Did you know they were going out?

205
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,118
As their teacher,

206
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,871
as their homeroom teacher,
how could you not do anything about it?

207
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,207
What was I supposed to do then?

208
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,167
What if Soo-bin's grades fall?

209
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,795
What if she fails
to get into a good university?

210
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,213
Don't you care

211
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,049
if something happens to her
while hanging out with a boy like him?

212
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,511
Ms. Yoon, Jun-u is not that kind of boy.

213
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,304
He is kind and hardworking.

214
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,891
Have you been encouraging
the kids to date like this?

215
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,144
How could an irresponsible person like you

216
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,854
become the kids' homeroom teacher?

217
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,815
How are the parents going to trust
you and send their kids to school?

218
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,400
Why? I mean, why?

219
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,071
Why do you mothers

220
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,782
have to do this?

221
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,578
I lost my temper.

222
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,872
I'm sorry if I crossed the line.

223
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:25,956
No.

224
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,083
No need to apologize to me.

225
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,419
Apologize to Jun-u and Soo-bin,
to the kids.

226
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:34,381
Children are not the property
of their parents. Am I wrong?

227
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,508
"Study.

228
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,802
Get into a good university.
Win by all means.

229
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,345
Hang out with that kid.

230
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,930
Don't hang out with that kid.

231
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,098
Dating?

232
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,350
That's out of the question."

233
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,687
You suffocate them
and intrude into their lives.

234
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,815
You even censor and judge their emotions.

235
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,695
This place

236
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,031
is not a prison.

237
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,451
And I'm not a prison guard.

238
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,455
When are you going to stop
telling me to monitor and control

239
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,916
those beautiful and kind-hearted kids?

240
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,047
You're losing your temper. I'm sorry.

241
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,259
I'm sorry too.

242
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,773
Hi, Ms. Yoon.

243
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,317
Soo-bin is in the science room.
Should I get her for you?

244
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,027
No. That's fine.

245
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,332
Bye.

246
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:00,968
Hello.

247
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,058
Let go.

248
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,685
You'll only make things worse.

249
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,190
Do you have something to tell me?

250
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,776
I won't meet Soo-bin outside of school.

251
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,779
Even at school,

252
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,865
I won't talk to her.

253
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,328
But...

254
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,456
please give her some freedom in return.

255
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,209
Please.

256
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:42,175
Why should I do that
just because you ask me to?

257
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,389
It all depends on how Soo-bin behaves.

258
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,122
I think I'll just focus on studying now.

259
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,792
That seems to be the only thing I can do

260
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,003
for Soo-bin right now.

261
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,551
Why am I so stupid?

262
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,636
Is Soo-bin stupid too?

263
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,931
What are you talking about?
Of course she's not.

264
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,808
Then you're not stupid either.

265
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,978
Soo-bin is not stupid at all,
and who does she like?

266
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,396
It's you.

267
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:38,940
Right?

268
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,155
Yoo Soo-bin.

269
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,034
Is your mom Sherlock or what?

270
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,368
It's painful.

271
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,497
I don't know how else to describe it.

272
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,291
It's just so painful.

273
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,045
For now, focus on the finals.

274
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:03,256
If you do well,
your mom might change her mind.

275
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,135
Even if Jun-u becomes a topper
in school, there's no chance.

276
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:11,098
Her mom prioritizes bloodlines
and stuff like that.

277
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,600
Bloodlines, my foot. Is she a dog or what?

278
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,061
You're okay as long as
you don't open that mouth.

279
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,646
You're not okay even with your mouth shut.

280
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:18,730
Likewise.

281
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,359
Chan-yeol, are you sick?

282
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,444
Why are you so down all day?

283
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:28,240
-Guys.
-What?

284
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,867
I like Mr. Oh.

285
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,911
-What?
-Who?

286
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,121
Oh Han-gyeol.

287
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,582
Gosh, why him, of all people?

288
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,377
This school is packed with guys.
Why does it have to be Mr. Oh?

289
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,838
What? Mr. Oh is handsome.

290
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,467
What's wrong with him?

291
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,469
He's the stud of Cheonbong High School!

292
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,848
Is it wrong for me to fall in love?

293
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,892
You, you, and you!
You guys are all in love.

294
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,645
Okay, we didn't say anything.

295
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,189
He's quite all right.

296
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,607
Why are you crying?

297
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,526
-Are you crying?
-Don't cry.

298
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,652
What do we do?

299
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,586
Let's begin today's class.

300
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:26,173
Let's see, where were we...

301
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,175
Page 106.

302
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,737
Everyone, let's go outside.

303
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,864
All right.

304
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:53,992
This feels so nice.

305
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,828
Oh, boy.

306
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,832
The sky looks so beautiful, doesn't it?

307
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:04,669
Have you guys ever looked up
at the sky lately?

308
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,547
-I don't think so.
-I knew it.

309
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,133
If someone's up there
and looking down at us,

310
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,677
they'll probably think we're so pitiful.

311
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:16,473
Annoying each other all the time
over our greed,

312
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,769
and hurting those who are precious to us.

313
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,571
Let's stop doing that!

314
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,089
I'm so tired.

315
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:56,221
Jun-u. Do you have a second to talk?

316
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:00,517
Tell me what's on your mind comfortably.

317
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:04,229
I know it's late,
but I want to apologize to you.

318
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:13,613
What you did

319
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:16,199
makes me angry,
but I know you didn't mean to hurt me.

320
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,451
I shouldn't have done that to you,

321
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:22,455
but I guess kissing up to Hwi-yeong
was so important to me back then.

322
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,375
I was so stupid.

323
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:30,505
But since that day,
I've always been feeling guilty.

324
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:32,882
I'm really sorry.

325
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:34,801
I mean it.

326
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,596
I don't know why I did it.

327
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,474
I really regret it.

328
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,144
I'm sorry, Jun-u.

329
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,320
To be honest, I blamed you a lot too.

330
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:56,990
It was really tough for me.

331
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,331
I'll accept your apology

332
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,292
for what you did wrong.

333
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:20,472
You know we're starting
a mentor-mentee program, right?

334
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:24,392
If there's anyone who wants to join,
give me your application form by today.

335
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,413
You can be my mentee.

336
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,916
I'm not becoming a mentor because of you.

337
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,585
I just need more points
for volunteer work. I don't have enough.

338
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:53,296
Oh, yes. Of course, I know.

339
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,590
If you don't do the homework I give you,

340
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:57,133
I'll quit right away.

341
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:00,261
Okay. I mean, yes, ma'am.

342
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:02,514
Study hard.

343
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:09,312
If you come within 200th in the finals,
I'll watch a movie with you.

344
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:11,231
Wait, Ro-mi.

345
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,400
What if...

346
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:15,902
I come within 100th?

347
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:20,323
What? Within 100th? Don't worry.
That will never happen.

348
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,659
I know it's very unlikely. But still,

349
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:25,161
what if I come within 100th?

350
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:30,875
I may go out with you.

351
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,879
Hey! How did it go?

352
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,215
-Go... Go out...
-Go outside?

353
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:39,592
This is low in calories.

354
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,845
It's just rye bread with vegetables.

355
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,641
This is the jerk who dumped me.

356
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,018
He made me a sandwich.

357
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,687
Is it the carrot and stick approach?

358
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,647
Come on, Da-huin.

359
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:54,441
That will be all for today.

360
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:55,692
Bye.

361
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,534
-So-ye.
-What?

362
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,661
-Well, I...
-Hi.

363
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,163
I have a favor to ask of you.

364
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:12,000
Your dance club's doing
the autumn performance, right?

365
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,960
Can you get some tickets for me?

366
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,504
Please, I'm begging you.

367
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:18,214
What is it, Sang-hun?

368
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:19,758
Is something wrong?

369
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,385
-What?
-Why are you bothering So-ye?

370
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,053
Since she's in the dance club.

371
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:28,433
By the way, is it totally over
between you and Hwi-yeong now?

372
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:30,518
Why? Because he's about to be humiliated?

373
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,396
Gosh, what happened to your
everlasting friendship or whatever?

374
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,023
-It's not like that.
-Don't try to fool me.

375
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,025
Or are you looking for
a new informant or something?

376
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,568
Should I do it?

377
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:42,155
Goodness, you should reflect
on yourself, Gi-tae.

378
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,324
That's why you need to be careful
who you meet.

379
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,786
Hey. Who are you to say that to Gi-tae?

380
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,413
He's regretting what he did wrong,
so don't worry.

381
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:51,623
Worry about yourself.

382
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,086
She's quite feisty.

383
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,764
Then you're not stupid either.

384
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,813
Soo-bin is not stupid at all,
and who does she like?

385
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,481
It's you.

386
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,069
You're pretty good at drawing.

387
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,822
That ladybug looks cute.

388
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,407
THE NAKED TREE

389
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,993
By the way, that was a good call too.

390
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:30,787
Not running away.

391
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,583
Very good.

392
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:38,920
"Yoo Soo-bin, good luck!"

393
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:45,260
I doubt that. I'm sure she was happy

394
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,387
because her son, Choe Jun-u, was born.

395
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:27,839
SUSEONG SAUNA

396
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,465
Darn it.

397
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,217
Gosh.

398
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,885
Oh, boy. This is...

399
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,348
Darn it!

400
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,516
It was you, wasn't it?

401
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:43,062
No, it really wasn't me.
Why would I post that on the website?

402
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,522
Why would I dig my own grave...

403
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,566
Right? There is something.

404
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,067
Gosh, I totally knew it.

405
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:51,029
Mr. Kim, please tell me the truth.

406
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,905
If you don't,

407
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,743
-I won't let you go.
-Gosh.

408
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,828
He's in trouble, isn't he?

409
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,291
His OMR sheet...

410
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,795
I tampered with it.
Just for two questions though.

411
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,715
That's huge for Hwi-yeong, you know.

412
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:13,051
I happened to find out
he made a mistake on the exam.

413
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,179
I didn't want to do it.

414
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,847
I know I shouldn't have done it,

415
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,266
but my family was struggling
financially at the time.

416
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,060
That's why

417
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:23,978
I cut a deal with Hwi-yeong's dad.

418
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,063
How...

419
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,815
Even if you were
in a financial bind, how...

420
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:31,402
-How could you?
-That's why I have to lie low.

421
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,072
I can't even sleep or eat these days.

422
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,910
What about the vice-principal?
Does he know?

423
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,912
No, no one knows. I did it alone.

424
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,705
Even Hwi-yeong doesn't know about it.

425
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:46,793
He probably thinks he marked
the correct answers by mistake.

426
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:50,421
You have no choice, then.

427
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,548
You need to step in
and explain what happened.

428
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,759
Then Hwi-yeong's parents and I
will be doomed.

429
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,095
If you don't do anything,
Hwi-yeong will be doomed.

430
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,971
You need to right the wrong.

431
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,598
Don't ruin his bright future.

432
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,186
Fix things, please.

433
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,063
The adults who did it

434
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,316
should confess to it
and pay for what they did.

435
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:14,821
Then give me some time, Mr. Oh.

436
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,037
MY DEAR JI-MIN

437
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:25,289
Hi, Ji-min.

438
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:26,749
Hello?

439
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:32,213
Mr. Oh, there's something
I need to tell you.

440
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,423
Are you all right? Are you feeling sick?

441
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:35,633
Did something happen?

442
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,594
I...

443
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,472
need some time.

444
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,015
Time for what?

445
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,852
I'm not sure if we can keep dating

446
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:50,606
and if I deserve a man like you.

447
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:54,152
What do you mean? Why wouldn't you
deserve to be with me?

448
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:57,321
I don't think I'm good enough for you.

449
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,740
I'm sorry.

450
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,784
Ji-min?

451
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:02,869
Hello?

452
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,762
Your drawings are quite nice.

453
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:25,558
Your grades will determine the type
of portfolio you have to prepare.

454
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,268
Considering your grades,

455
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,854
I think you'll need
a basic design portfolio.

456
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,356
For the schools that accept
basic design portfolios,

457
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,526
your portfolio and drawing test score
can take up 60 to 100 percent.

458
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,195
There are many art schools
you can get into

459
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,071
if you improve your grades
and start working on

460
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,115
your portfolio and application right away.

461
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:47,580
Could having a bad student record

462
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,833
affect admission decisions?

463
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,086
If I was forced to transfer, for example.

464
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,256
It'll put you
at a disadvantage, of course.

465
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,134
But every school has different
admission requirements, though.

466
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,470
If you're aiming
for one of the top universities,

467
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,597
you'll need to improve your grades more.

468
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,476
But there are schools
that have their own admission tests,

469
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,478
so those schools can be your options too.

470
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,731
I see.

471
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,816
How much do the lessons cost?

472
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,069
Well, that's...

473
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:21,572
Would you like a quote then?

474
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:24,992
Yes, please.

475
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,002
Give me that. I'll do it.

476
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:01,589
No, don't waste your energy.
Just go over there and study for the exam.

477
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,300
This is great
for improving my concentration.

478
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,345
It's because of Ji-min, isn't it?

479
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:12,308
You knew?

480
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,977
She told me about you.

481
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,021
She said you're a wonderful person,

482
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,607
but she doesn't feel ready yet.

483
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,943
What? Ready for what?
Is she going fishing?

484
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,153
Is she going hiking or what?

485
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,784
I know it's hard, but give her some time.

486
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,744
Like you and Soo-bin?

487
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,455
I know it's hard.

488
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,880
God, liking someone

489
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,299
can be such an ordeal, right?

490
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,636
Whether you're 18, 28,

491
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,388
or 38 years old, it doesn't matter.

492
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,348
Mr. Oh.

493
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,434
Are you 28?

494
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:02,149
Whether you're 48 or 58,

495
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:06,278
whether you're 68 or 78,

496
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:11,784
Whether you're 88, 98,

497
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,370
or 108 years old...

498
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,288
Jun-u, eat as much as you want.

499
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,540
Here, eat up.

500
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:18,874
Thank you.

501
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,877
Hey, I'm excited to see
how well you'll do on the finals.

502
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,713
You've been studying hard.
Will your grades go up this time?

503
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,634
Have you decided
to totally focus on studying?

504
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,102
I'm hoping Soo-bin's mother

505
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:41,188
will become fond of me
if I do well on the finals.

506
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,858
So I'm studying hard,

507
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,403
but I can't help wondering this.

508
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:52,408
"Even if I manage to get higher grades
or even get the highest grades,

509
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:58,414
will Soo-bin's mother ever approve of me?

510
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,585
Why am I making all this effort?

511
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,922
Is this really the best thing I can do

512
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,966
for myself?"

513
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,011
Something like that.

514
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:16,098
Come on. You need to stay strong.

515
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:18,434
Who cares about
what her mother thinks of you?

516
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,478
Do it to make yourself proud.

517
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,771
Make Choe Jun-u proud.

518
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:25,566
"I'm doing so well.
I'm making this much effort.

519
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,985
I'm doing great."

520
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,198
But what comes after that?

521
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,326
After that...

522
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,079
A new story will unfold.

523
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:44,460
Jun-u, think about the time
when you first came to our school.

524
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:48,130
You met Soo-bin and this amazing teacher

525
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,799
because you didn't run away back then.

526
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,636
Don't you agree?

527
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:56,472
Yes.

528
00:41:57,556 --> 00:42:00,684
Jun-u, don't think too far ahead.

529
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,228
Just do it.

530
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:05,564
Now. Don't leave any regrets.

531
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:07,608
Okay?

532
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:12,905
Okay.

533
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:17,201
Good. If you were a grown-up,
I'd drink soju with you right now.

534
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:20,246
Let's at least drink some water together.

535
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:23,374
All right. Bottoms up.

536
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,167
It's just water.

537
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,598

ANONYMOUS BULLETIN BOARD

539
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,104
YOU RECEIVED AN E-MAIL FROM JOSEPH.

540
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:48,774
HWI-YEONG.

541
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:51,235
DO YOU THINK YOU GOT TO WHERE YOU ARE
ALL ON YOUR OWN?

542
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,779
LAST YEAR, YOU GOT A PERFECT SCORE
ON THE MATH FINAL

543
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:56,156
EVEN THOUGH YOU GOT TWO QUESTIONS WRONG.

544
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,617
IT'S BECAUSE YOUR HOMEROOM TEACHER
TAMPERED WITH YOUR ANSWER SHEET.

545
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,953
COME CLEAN ABOUT IT
AND GET WHAT YOU DESERVE,

546
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:03,372
OR YOU AND YOUR PARENTS' LIVES
WILL BE DESTROYED.

REPORT CARD

548
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:29,440
Good morning.

549
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,194
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

550
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:47,750
Why isn't Mr. Kim picking up?
I'm getting worried.

551
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:55,716
Mr. Kim, you promised me

552
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:58,344
that you'd explain the situation yourself.

553
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:01,388
Mr. Kim, as a fellow teacher,

554
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,182
I trust you.

555
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,906
CHEER UP, LITTLE PEA

556
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:14,211
God, you don't want to
go to the movies with me, do you?

557
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:17,589
How could you say that?
That's what I live for.

558
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:18,674
Solve it.

559
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,345
COME CLEAN ABOUT IT
AND GET WHAT YOU DESERVE.

560
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,816
CHEER UP, LITTLE PEA

561
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,906
STUDY PLAN FOR FINAL EXAMS

562
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,897
-Mom.
-Did I wake you?

563
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:18,525
-I tried to be quiet.
-When did you get here?

564
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:19,610
I stayed up late.

565
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:22,196
I came early in the morning
to make breakfast for you.

566
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:23,906
Your exams start today, right?

567
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:26,992
I meant to come last night,

568
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:29,161
but customers stayed late
at the restaurant.

569
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:31,121
I eat well on my own.

570
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,624
Then why is your face so thin?

571
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,753
Anyway, I'm glad you're up.
I have to get going soon,

572
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:40,214
so I thought I'd leave before you wake up.

573
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:43,008
-So soon?
-I have to go open the restaurant.

574
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,718
Isn't Aunt Hye-yeong there?

575
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:47,471
She's not feeling so well these days.

576
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,641
You don't seem so well either.

577
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:51,892
Are you sick?

578
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:56,855
No. I'm in perfect health.

579
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,149
Let's eat.

580
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:04,613
-Eat up.
-Okay.

581
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:08,575
Start with fish. It's good for your brain.

582
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,749
Is Soo-bin doing well?

583
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:19,336
Is her mom very busy?
I haven't heard from her in a while.

584
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,672
I thought we're like sisters now.

585
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:24,466
She hasn't found out
that you two are dating, right?

586
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:27,636
No.

587
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:31,640
Tell her if you get good grades
on the finals.

588
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:35,435
Even though she might look
a tiny bit aggressive

589
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,354
on the outside,

590
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:39,898
she's actually a really cool person.

591
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:42,901
We might look like
completely different types,

592
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,611
but we get along pretty well.

593
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:46,822
I shouldn't miss my bus.

594
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:49,283
Jun-u, do well on your exams.

595
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:52,119
I'll send you some good energy
while working.

596
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:53,954
Okay. Thanks.

597
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:57,874
My son. I love you.

598
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:00,294
-I'll be going.
-Okay.

599
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:04,089
Oh, right. Say hi to Soo-bin for me.

600
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:05,632
Good luck.

601
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:09,094
Stick with the same answer for
every question you're not sure about.

602
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:10,304
I get it, Mom.

603
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,309
-Mom.
-Yes?

604
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:18,937
Is everything all right with you?

605
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:20,731
Yes.

606
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:25,569
-Okay. Get home safe.
-I will.

607
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,239
-Let's do this.
-Let's do this.

608
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:46,882
RED GINSENG WILL GIVE YOU ENERGY.
DO WELL ON THE EXAM! SOO-BIN

609
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:08,755
She's been using it.

610
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:10,549
It smells good.

611
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,594
It suits her.

612
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:43,623
COME CLEAN ABOUT IT...

613
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:55,385
Gosh!

614
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:58,680
Ro-mi, I got more than 50 points.

615
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,349
-You got 51 points.
-Really?

616
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:05,896
-Please always be my teacher.
-Be quiet.

617
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,981
I messed up.

618
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:09,566
It's your fault.

619
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:11,651
It's all your fault!

620
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,159
Did you get everything right?

621
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:22,537
I knew it.

622
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:25,624
You only got four questions wrong?

623
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:30,045
I know, right? That's strange.

624
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:32,881
What's with you? How did you do so well?

625
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:34,424
That's not okay.

626
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:38,261
I got so many wrong.

627
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,766
Da-huin, are you okay?

628
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:45,060
-I'm okay.
-Should I do it for you?

629
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:46,311
I'm done.

630
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:48,438
Did you do well?

631
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:50,690
Kind of. You?

632
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:52,442
Let me see.

633
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:54,319
-I'm done. You're heavy.
-Me too.

634
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:03,161
Hwi-yeong, did you get
a perfect score this time too?

635
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:04,913
See you.

636
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:08,500
-Hwi-yeong, you got a perfect score again?
-Will you be top of our year again?

637
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:11,628
-I envy you.
-Tell me about it.

638
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:36,236
Hello, son. Did you do well on the exam?

639
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,405
You got the highest grades
this time too, right?

640
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,031
Great job, my son.

641
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:41,324
Mom, what do I do?

642
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:43,743
I don't think
I can get the highest grades.

643
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,620
What? My goodness.

644
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:47,247
You know how to crack a joke too?

645
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,124
That's not funny at all, though.

646
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,458
I really mean it.

647
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:53,169
I got five math questions wrong.

648
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,880
What? Five?

649
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:56,131
So I was wondering...

650
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:59,175
if you could take care of it
this time as well.

651
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:00,719
Take care of what?

652
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:05,432
I heard you and Dad asked to have
my grades fabricated last year.

653
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:09,936
I'll need your help again.

654
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,107
Who said that? Hwi-yeong, who said that?

655
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:15,442
Who? Mr. Kim?

656
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:16,693
Help me.

657
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,279
I'm counting on you and Dad.

658
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:22,574
Hello? Hwi-yeong.

659
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,123
Why isn't he answering?

660
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:32,709
Hello? Honey.

661
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:34,002
The thing is...

662
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,004
Hwi-yeong has...

663
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:37,547
Oh, no...

664
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:44,888
Really? You got a perfect score?

665
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:46,473
Oh, my gosh!

666
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:48,767
You really got a perfect score?
Hold on. Then...

667
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,268
What was your score for the midterm?

668
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:52,437
Are you in the top tier
if you add those two scores?

669
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,190
I'll know when the rest of my grades
come out,

670
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,525
but I think I might make it.

671
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:59,486
I can't believe it, Soo-bin!

672
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:02,238
You did a great job.
Thank you, my daughter.

673
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:05,992
I knew you could do it if you just
grit your teeth and try your best.

674
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:08,787
Soo-bin. What do you want to eat?
I'll buy you anything.

675
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:12,040
No, let's go shopping.
I'll buy you clothes.

676
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:15,377
You wanted to go. Let's go to the mall.
I'll buy you... Oh, right.

677
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,462
Darn, I have a meeting this evening.

678
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:19,089
What should we do? What do I do?

679
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:21,549
It's okay, Mom.
I'll just go home and rest.

680
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:22,968
You want to rest? Okay, then.

681
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:25,553
Get some rest. I'll call you
as soon as my meeting ends

682
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:27,764
and head straight home.
Let's eat something good. Okay?

683
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:30,809
Soo-bin, I love you so much.

684
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:32,519
You need to keep going forward like this.

685
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:33,812
And get into SNU.

686
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:35,271
Do you understand? Let's go!

687
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:38,316
-What's the matter?
-I can't believe this.

688
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,610
-What's wrong?
-She suddenly fainted.

689
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:45,365
Hey, O-je. This is bad.

690
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:46,658
Da-huin fainted.

691
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,327
-I think it's because of malnutrition.
-What?

692
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:50,745
Follow me.

693
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:52,831
Da-huin!

694
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:54,666
She fell asleep.

695
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:56,167
We'll be outside.

696
00:54:58,253 --> 00:54:59,379
You can go home.

697
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:02,090
I'll take Da-huin home.

698
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,258
Will you?

699
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:06,761
Let's go after she wakes up at least.

700
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:09,222
-Chan-yeol.
-What?

701
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:10,682
Read the room already.

702
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,561
Let's go, guys. Come on.

703
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:16,396
Gosh.

704
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,070
Leave, O-je.

705
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,364
I don't want to see you.

706
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:28,116
You weren't sleeping?

707
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:30,744
I told you to leave.

708
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:32,537
Leave.

709
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:35,999
Then I'll go call your friends.

710
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:45,967
It's not because I don't like you.

711
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:50,722
There you go again.
Stop saying ridiculous things.

712
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,433
-I'm sick and tired of it.
-To be honest...

713
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:56,978
I like someone.

714
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:59,230
Forget it. I don't want to hear it.

715
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:00,565
It's not a girl.

716
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:09,449
I'm also flustered
that I feel this type of emotion.

717
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:14,120
But there's nothing I can do about it.

718
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:18,458
I keep thinking about
what's wrong with me too.

719
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,963
I'm sorry, Da-huin.

720
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:36,643
It's Hwi-yeong, isn't it?
That person you like.

721
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:44,692
Leave.

722
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:50,949
I'll take you home.

723
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:53,493
-I told you to leave.
-Da-huin, let's go.

724
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,328
Come on, let's go home.

725
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:57,831
Are you okay?

726
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:00,875
-I can walk on my own.
-No.

727
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:07,006
Hey, O-je. What is this?

728
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,091
What?

729
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:16,975
That brat!

730
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:18,643
Da-huin.

731
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:20,186
Da-huin.

732
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,604
Da-huin!

733
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:23,440
Hey!

734
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:32,991
What do we do?

735
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,286
-Oh, no...
-Da-huin.

736
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:39,747
-What do we do?
-It's okay, Da-huin.

737
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:41,749
No, but she...

738
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:44,252
-She wrote in the chat room...
-It's okay.

739
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:46,921
I didn't know she was here. I'm sorry.

740
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,548
No, don't be.

741
00:57:57,307 --> 00:58:00,977
JUNG O-JE

742
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:12,906
Hey, O-je. Do you...

743
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:14,449
Yes.

744
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:16,534
Well...

745
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:19,662
Is Da-huin okay?

746
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:23,166
Yes, she's okay.

747
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,919
Okay. I'm glad to hear that.

748
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,048
Let's talk later.

749
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,050
Make sure Da-huin gets home safely.

750
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:33,551
Okay.

751
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:35,345
-Talk to you later.
-Bye.

752
00:58:58,826 --> 00:58:59,911
Hello?

753
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:01,621
Is this Jun-u?

754
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:12,924
Yes.

755
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:16,135
Then I'll send you an address.

756
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:17,929
I'll see you there.

757
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:26,854
Soo-bin.

758
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,190
Get home safely. I need to go.

759
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:30,900
Where are you going?

760
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:32,819
Our favorite cafe.

761
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:34,153
Why are you going there?

762
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:36,072
I'll tell you later.

763
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:48,334
Soo-bin.

764
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:51,170
Keep looking forward.

765
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:56,968
Use this.

766
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:58,303
It's okay...

767
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:01,282
MA HWI-YEONG

768
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:05,078
MA HWI-YEONG

769
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:12,168
The person you are trying to reach...

770
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:25,098
MA HWI-YEONG

771
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:30,186
MA HWI-YEONG

772
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:33,189
What?

773
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:44,909
Hello, I'm Choe Jun-u.

774
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:46,703
Yes, I know.

775
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:48,579
You came to see me a while ago.

776
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:59,048
Have a seat. What do you want to drink?

777
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:16,649
Did you think...

778
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,652
I didn't recognize you back then?

779
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:24,949
No, it wasn't like that.

780
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:30,329
How could I not recognize you?
I can tell at a glance.

781
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:35,460
Is that why you wrote me the letter?

782
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:37,795
So I'd recognize you?

783
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:42,884
I couldn't do it for a long time,

784
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:45,845
but my friend helped me
muster up the courage

785
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:48,181
so that I wouldn't have regrets.

786
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:52,143
Your girlfriend?

787
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:54,854
Yes.

788
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:58,733
I used to always run away from reality,

789
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:01,527
but I've changed because of her.

790
01:03:02,695 --> 01:03:04,572
She gives me courage.

791
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:09,285
What a great friend.

792
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:11,245
You're right.

793
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:14,791
You should never run away.
It's not a good thing to do.

794
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:17,794
But you see, Jun-u,

795
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:21,839
I ran away like a coward.

796
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:27,887
No, you came back like this.

797
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:35,228
I came here to ask you for a favor.

798
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:41,442
Don't visit me like that again.

799
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:51,661
CHOE MYEONG-JUN

800
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:54,205
Thank goodness I saw this letter first.

801
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,625
It's all in the past, you know.

802
01:03:58,042 --> 01:03:59,544
You're all grown up now,

803
01:03:59,877 --> 01:04:01,254
and I have another family.

804
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,632
I think we each have

805
01:04:05,883 --> 01:04:08,177
different paths to take.

806
01:04:09,595 --> 01:04:11,055
Do you understand?

807
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,143
I'm sorry, Jun-u.

808
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:52,722
Could you please drive a little faster?

809
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:49,904
Jun-u!

810
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:56,160
Jun-u, are you all right?

811
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:00,748
Soo-bin.

812
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:51,507
My mom still thinks that the time
she spent with her first love

813
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:54,343
years ago was the most
beautiful moment in her life.

814
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,095
Back when she was 18.

815
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:59,265
Writing a letter like this
is the only thing I can do now,

816
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:02,018
but I'm here for you. Let's stay strong.

817
01:07:02,101 --> 01:07:03,894
I miss you, and I like you.

818
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:06,522
-Can't you take care of it again?
-How dare you!

819
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:08,899
It turned out to be me. The informant.

820
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:11,402
Drawing, art, and art school.

821
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:12,486
Soo-bin.

822
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:15,197
I have a goal now.

823
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:18,034
Big news. People from the Office
of the Education came to get Hwi-yeong.

824
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:19,285
I admit all the allegations.

825
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:20,828
I'll cooperate with the investigation.

826
01:07:20,911 --> 01:07:22,079
Happy birthday.

827
01:07:25,082 --> 01:07:27,168
Let's go now. I'll walk you home.

828
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:42,475
