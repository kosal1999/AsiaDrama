1
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:47,088
I should make it look like the Milky Way.

2
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,384
It'd be so refreshing to come here
after a bath, right?

3
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:53,970
Yes.

4
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,487
What's wrong?

5
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,210
I need to use the restroom.

6
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,351
I've been hesitating,
but I think you should see this.

7
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,686
Jun-u sent me this before.

8
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,939
FORWARDED MESSAGE FROM HWI-YEONG

9
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:49,651
Soo-bin is the person
who's most important to you, right?

10
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,444
I'll take her away from you.

11
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,031
Soo-bin.

12
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,159
Is something wrong?

13
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:06,042
My mom told me to come home now.

14
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,087
Your mom? Let's go.

15
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,255
You should...

16
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,924
finish watching the movie. I can go alone.

17
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:15,635
There's no point watching it without you.

18
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,473
Let's go.

19
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,562
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,606
Let's hurry.

21
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,502
You can go now. I can go home alone.

22
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,673
I can't believe it.

23
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:57,010
Whether the text you sent
Hwi-yeong is true or not.

24
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,137
I'm afraid

25
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,598
I'll keep liking you even if it is true.

26
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,356
Do you have a fever? You're burning up.

27
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,402
Let me see.

28
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,699
You're running a fever.

29
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,159
Do you have medicine at home?

30
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,245
I'm okay.

31
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,169
Soo-bin, hold on. Wait here for a second.

32
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:36,090
PHARMACY

33
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,722
My friend is running a fever.

34
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,227
What are you doing, Soo-bin?

35
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,728
Why are you waiting for him?

36
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,772
Just go.

37
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,440
Go.

38
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,096
It could be an upset stomach.

39
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,806
So I bought some medicine for that too.

40
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,563
Did your mom find out

41
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,232
that you were with me?

42
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,528
No. She just told me to come home.

43
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,080
Go. I'll leave.

44
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,583
Get better soon.

45
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,136
Oh, Hwi-yeong.

46
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,637
-Hello.
-Hi.

47
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,557
I'm sorry.
Soo-bin went out with her friends.

48
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,142
Mom.

49
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,024
Oh, are you two having lunch together?

50
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,366
He carried Soo-bin here.

51
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,286
The one who was forced to transfer, right?

52
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,711
I was worried about you.

53
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:41,507
Is...

54
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,093
that message true?

55
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:51,768
Jun-u...

56
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,063
must have been holding a grudge
against me.

57
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,274
He thinks I'm responsible

58
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,444
for all the things
that have happened so far.

59
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,404
But that's just a misunderstanding.

60
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,949
-Are you sure?
-What?

61
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:17,794
Hwi-yeong,

62
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,379
what have you done?

63
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,257
Hwi-yeong, do me a favor.

64
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,970
I want this to stay between you and me.

65
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,099
By the way,

66
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,018
do Gi-tae and the other kids already know?

67
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,397
And don't tell Jun-u

68
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,651
that I know about this.

69
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,195
Because that would embarrass him?

70
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:48,658
No.

71
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,745
Because that would hurt my pride.

72
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,250
Bye, then.

73
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,742
I didn't get to give her the present.

74
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,415
I can't let him take her away from me.

75
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,750
I can't let that happen.

76
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:51,971
What are you doing?

77
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,558
All by yourself.

78
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,060
Are you sure you want to do this?

79
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,073
Why are you kicking so hard?

80
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,871
Take it easy.

81
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,792
Is something wrong?

82
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:23,920
You should go now.

83
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,390
What do you do when you hate yourself?

84
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,601
When you're angry at yourself.

85
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,937
Why are you angry at yourself?

86
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,274
Because I'm so stupid.

87
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,946
Never mind. Don't worry about it.

88
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,039
Soo-bin, are you okay?

89
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,354
What's with you now?

90
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,525
O-je.

91
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,778
Isn't it hot out here?

92
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:40,913
Why are you here?

93
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,208
So you just came home like that?

94
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:49,130
What else could I do?
Her mom told her to come home.

95
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,134
-Are you sure that's true?
-What?

96
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,471
My goodness. I can't believe you, Jun-u.

97
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,891
What did you even dress up

98
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,602
and do your hair so nicely for?

99
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,855
Did you even finish the movie?

100
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,315
We left in the middle.

101
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,692
-What?
-Forget it.

102
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:19,076
To be honest,
I've never liked someone this much.

103
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:21,996
Is this your first love?

104
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,337
So it's really your first love.

105
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,006
Gosh, this should be recorded.

106
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,258
You're right.

107
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:35,676
It's my first love.

108
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,722
First love.

109
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,184
Isn't it nice, Jun-u?

110
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,065
Doesn't it feel like you're floating

111
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,650
on a cloud?

112
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,363
I'm not sure.

113
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,616
The part that feels nice is
this tiny for now.

114
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,911
The rest feels somewhat...

115
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,873
heavy and awkward.

116
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,710
It's messy...

117
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,921
and confusing.

118
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,384
You can't stop thinking
that you're not good enough.

119
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,513
I feel like even the sound of my breathing
might bother her.

120
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,683
I want to do this right,

121
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,853
but I keep making mistakes.

122
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,234
Still, you're lucky

123
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,945
you can like someone as much as you like.

124
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,533
Cheer up, dude.

125
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,993
What's the problem?
You two like each other.

126
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,041
"Each other"?

127
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,675
Hi, I'm in the lobby now.

128
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,470
Building B, Room 1901.
I'm coming up right now.

129
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,640
Song-hui.

130
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,350
Do you live here?

131
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,521
Yes. My apartment in Yangjae-dong
is still occupied.

132
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,191
You should move. Soo-bin will
be tutored in this building.

133
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,402
Really? When does she start?

134
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,446
Is she here too?

135
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,739
She's not here, luckily.

136
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:23,951
Wait, Song-hui.

137
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,790
Song-hui, are you okay?

138
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,292
Are you okay?

139
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,252
Don't touch me. Just go.

140
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,963
Are you okay, though?

141
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,506
Go.

142
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,302
It hurts so much.

143
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,641
Just a second.

144
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,643
Song-hui, are you okay?

145
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,146
Tell me if you're okay.

146
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,481
Just go!

147
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,069
Are you okay?

148
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,238
-Gosh.
-Are you hurt?

149
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:09,747
This is humiliating. Darn it.

150
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,625
What should I do? My goodness.

151
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,175
Is she very sick?

152
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,520
Mom.

153
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,480
Did you get hurt? How?

154
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,191
I went to see your tutor and fell.

155
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,443
How did you fall?

156
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,654
Why did you have to
find a new tutor anyway?

157
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,405
It's not like the tutor pushed me.

158
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,115
Go to bed. I'm going to sleep.

159
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:46,867
Okay.

160
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,222
You're not answering.

161
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:09,974
I'm worried.

162
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,487
Why does it hurt so much?

163
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,614
I don't think I have a cold.

164
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,912
Did I do something wrong?

165
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,669
I went to the theater.

166
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,129
I saw her.

167
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:48,220
Was the popcorn too big?

168
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,682
Was it the soda?

169
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,642
I couldn't find our seats too.

170
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,105
When we left...

171
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,524
You were too lame, Jun-u.

172
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,204
Mom, are you asleep?

173
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,875
You didn't have dinner,
so I warmed some milk for you.

174
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,835
Leave it here.

175
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,308
Mom.

176
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,519
Something happened, didn't it?

177
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,730
What do you mean?

178
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,024
My arm hurts a lot, that's why.

179
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,658
Mom.

180
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,122
Do you have a fever?

181
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:59,583
Are you sick?

182
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:01,794
No.

183
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,838
I just don't feel too great, that's all.

184
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,674
I took medicine.

185
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,426
Then go to sleep.

186
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,388
In a little bit.

187
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,354
Don't get sick.

188
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,902
It's depressing.

189
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,117
If you're depressed,

190
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,328
you can't study.

191
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:41,625
Okay.

192
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,963
You too. Don't get sick.

193
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,814
Hey, Soo-bin.

194
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,357
How was your first date?

195
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,279
You ignored our texts all weekend long.

196
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:14,408
It must've been so good
that you forgot all about us.

197
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,827
You guys met yesterday too, right?

198
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,247
That's why you were out of it, right?
That's why you ignored our texts.

199
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,916
No. I wasn't feeling well.

200
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,669
And we left right after the movie
on Saturday.

201
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,129
Something came up at home.

202
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,130
What?

203
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,799
Did your mom find out?

204
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,469
That's why you're like this, isn't it?

205
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,722
Is a storm approaching?

206
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,183
That's not it.

207
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,604
O-je.

208
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,439
Oh, hey.

209
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:49,401
Sorry I couldn't call you yesterday.
I went to my grandma's farm.

210
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,819
You did?

211
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,030
Me too.

212
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:56,992
Hi.

213
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,953
Hey. Hi.

214
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,705
You look good together.

215
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,962
Come on. Let me join too.

216
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:13,050
I heard they help you prepare your
applications and the interview for SNU.

217
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:24,311
What is that brat Ro-mi
working so hard at this time?

218
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,437
Let's go.

219
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,568
Da-huin.

220
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,112
Sorry.

221
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,405
I felt uncomfortable
in front of the others.

222
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,741
Are you mad?

223
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,873
Don't be mad. Please?

224
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,000
What is this?

225
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,336
Did you bring this
from your grandma's farm?

226
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,004
It's so cute.

227
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,969
I can't even get mad at you.

228
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,012
Sorry.

229
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,473
So don't be mad, please?

230
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,643
-Please?
-Okay.

231
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,021
Sorry, but you have to be
in the top tier in every subject.

232
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,940
I'll make it into the top tier
in the next exams.

233
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,191
That will do.

234
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,734
Right?

235
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:16,572
Ro-mi, I'll introduce you
to another tutoring group then.

236
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,532
You know Park Si-hyeon
in Class Two, right?

237
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:22,578
-He's joining an SNU prep team--
-No. I want to be on your team.

238
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,663
Your team is guaranteed to get into SNU.

239
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,291
Ro-mi.

240
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:37,885
Ro-mi.

241
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,806
My mom asked when you'll deposit
the consulting fee.

242
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,183
I heard you requested it too.

243
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,351
Yes. My mom must have forgotten.

244
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,644
I'll remind her.

245
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,606
You know, I saw Soo-bin
at the movie theater.

246
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,567
She was there with Jun-u on Saturday.

247
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,281
MOM

248
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,546
Hi, Mom.

249
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,467
Yes.

250
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,724
I'm dead.

251
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,060
Hwi-yeong,
are you going to the science camp?

252
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,478
No.

253
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,649
Give me those.

254
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,526
-Thanks.
-Okay.

255
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,330
Guys, these are application forms
for the science camp.

256
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,791
Fill it out and give it to me today
if you're interested.

257
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,145
Hello, ma'am.
I heard you wanted to see me?

258
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:19,152
Why was Hwi-yeong's English
performance assessment grade

259
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:22,406
not a perfect score?

260
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,951
Well, the thing is, whereas Hwi-yeong

261
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,036
did a good job presenting,

262
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,290
he was lacking in
the collaboration aspect.

263
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,209
Still, he does much better
than the other kids,

264
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,836
so don't worry.

265
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,213
So this is when I should say this.

266
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,465
I'm so flabbergasted.

267
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:44,177
He has never received
anything but a perfect score.

268
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:47,973
Look, ma'am. Just because

269
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:51,476
Hwi-yeong has been receiving
perfect scores until now

270
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,855
doesn't mean all evaluations
must follow that precedent.

271
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:58,650
Do you think it's appropriate
to be talking about precedents right now?

272
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,945
Look. Hwi-yeong isn't someone

273
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:06,533
whose grades can be deducted
by teachers like you as they please.

274
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,702
Didn't the other teachers tell you?

275
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:12,122
I didn't deduct it as I pleased.

276
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:16,001
Ma'am. I think about it
long and hard as a teacher

277
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,462
and evaluate the kids' grades.

278
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:22,591
What you just said is a bit offensive.

279
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:31,141
I understand what you mean.

280
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,018
I finally get it.

281
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,437
I've been busy lately,

282
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,689
so I couldn't look after you.

283
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,901
-Pardon?
-I'll discuss it

284
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,569
with Hwi-yeong's dad.

285
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,530
Thank you for making time for me today.

286
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:49,910
Excuse me. What do you mean?

287
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:52,329
Come on, Mr. Oh.

288
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:55,540
There's more to you than meets
the eye. You're a real pro.

289
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,417
I got it.

290
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,669
I'll take good care of you.

291
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,969
What's she talking about?

292
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,558
Excuse me. Ma'am?

293
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,353
-Ma'am. Did it go well?
-I don't know what you mean.

294
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:17,521
Ma'am?

295
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,483
Really?

296
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,697
Didn't I make it clear that I like Jun-u?

297
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,783
How could you watch a movie with him?

298
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,827
Jun-u asked me first.

299
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,870
Even if he did.

300
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:39,209
Is there any reason that
I can't watch a movie with him?

301
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,378
We can watch a movie
as classmates, can't we?

302
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,839
But why does it have to be
Jun-u of all people?

303
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,173
Ro-mi.

304
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,261
I really didn't want to say this,

305
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,263
but I heard that Jun-u made it clear.

306
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,098
That he wanted to stay friends with you.

307
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,142
He even told you that?

308
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,728
Anyhow, even though he likes you,
how could you do that to me?

309
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,814
You even gave me advice the other day.

310
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,691
You knew that too?

311
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:05,861
Fine.

312
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,114
I'll be honest with you.

313
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,074
I like him too.

314
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:14,327
I used to like him.

315
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:18,707
Even if you like him,
there's no reason that I can't.

316
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:22,961
It's not like you can control
your feelings all the time.

317
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,382
So when we met at the cafe,

318
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:29,301
I was going to tell you everything.

319
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:33,305
But you were so serious,
so I missed the right moment.

320
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,766
I'm sorry for not telling you then.

321
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,688
Why am I making up excuses?

322
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:44,107
No, never mind.

323
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,734
You "used" to like him?

324
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,611
You don't anymore?

325
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,238
You don't like him anymore, right?

326
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,699
What about now?

327
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:56,161
You don't like Jun-u now. Am I right?

328
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,374
Ro-mi.

329
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,211
I understand how you feel,

330
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,756
but I hope you stop
whining about it to me.

331
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,091
It's stressing me out too.

332
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,470
You made it clear
that you don't like Jun-u.

333
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,850
When did I say that? I said I didn't know.

334
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,273
Jun-u. You're late.

335
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,993
Goodness, I feel so sorry for Pil-sang.

336
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:01,601
Let's go inside.

337
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,948
Now, a settlement is

338
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:18,743
a place where people live together.
It can be a city or a village.

339
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:21,454
A settlement pattern is
a pattern where the city and village

340
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:22,956
are closely connected

341
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,875
and interact with each other regularly

342
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,378
within the settlement.

343
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:31,631
A central area is a place
that provides goods and services

344
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,508
to the surrounding areas,

345
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:36,720
and the areas that receive goods and
services from the central area

346
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:39,723
-are called the surrounding areas...
-So-ye, is something wrong?

347
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:41,975
Are you sick?

348
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,602
To be considered as a central area,

349
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:47,814
the maximum coverage space
covered by the area

350
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:51,318
must be bigger than the minimum
amount of demand.

351
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,571
According to the functions of
the central area,

352
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:56,406
it is divided into sections.

353
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:59,117
It can be divided into
a high and low central area.

354
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,579
You made it clear
that you don't like Jun-u.

355
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,124
If you look below, you can see a hexagon.

356
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,710
That's called the Central Area Theory.

357
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,340
Numerous central areas are
gathered in a particular space,

358
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:17,093
and some areas overlap with
each other and cause problems...

359
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:20,138
Pil-sang, I think it's true
that Ro-mi likes Jun-u.

360
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,433
What? Choe Jun-u, you jerk.

361
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,810
Yoo Pil-sang. Go stand in the back.

362
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,868
I think it might rain.

363
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:47,999
Come over here. You little punk.

364
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,667
Pil-sang.

365
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:50,668
Hey.

366
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:52,045
Hey!

367
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:55,090
Darn, I flew like a butterfly
and stung like a bee.

368
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,425
-Just walk casually.
-Hey!

369
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,677
Are you mad at me about something?

370
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,013
Why do you keep avoiding me?

371
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:04,974
Gi-tae, you...

372
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:11,773
You shouldn't hang out with Hwi-yeong.

373
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,691
Are you his butler or what?

374
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,653
What are you talking about... A butler?

375
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,573
-You're being a bit harsh, So-ye.
-You are his butler.

376
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,867
Whenever he calls,
you run to him right away.

377
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,787
You help him with everything in class
and always worry about him.

378
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:29,416
And I didn't like
that incident with Jun-u too.

379
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,126
You think I want to do that?

380
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,086
-I have no choice--
-I know.

381
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:36,756
I know you think you can get into a nice
university if you hang out with Hwi-yeong.

382
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,591
But I hate it.

383
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,009
When you act like that.

384
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:42,512
I hate my boyfriend being
treated like a pushover...

385
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,055
What do you expect me to do then?

386
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,308
You know my family isn't well off.

387
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,853
How could I ever receive
an expensive private lesson like that?

388
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:53,648
How could I join the study group
if Hwi-yeong didn't let me?

389
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,776
I like hanging out with Hwi-yeong.

390
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:05,994
I'm sorry, So-ye.

391
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,788
I didn't mean to say...
I'm sorry, I didn't mean...

392
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,206
Make your choice then.

393
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,709
To be my boyfriend

394
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,170
or Hwi-yeong's butler.

395
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,731
O-je, why are you so late?

396
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,232
I'm sorry.

397
00:29:58,671 --> 00:29:59,672
Get lost.

398
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:01,800
Come on, move.

399
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:05,011
-Don't go.
-Don't even look back and move.

400
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,513
Don't go.

401
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,307
Try all you want.

402
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,228
I have your back from now on.

403
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,483
Today, you will draw your friend.

404
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,485
Draw the person who's sitting
in front of you.

405
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,237
-You all have partners, right?
-Yes.

406
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,906
Draw the main outline first.

407
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:28,785
Next, draw the detailed eyes, nose,
and lips.

408
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,247
Come on, that looks so funny.

409
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,373
Seriously.

410
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:38,503
You'll notice light and shade
while you're drawing.

411
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,797
The parts that protrude and don't.

412
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:44,092
Look at your friend's face closely
and add some shading.

413
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,147
Also,

414
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,358
if you look more closely,

415
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,696
you'll know which part needs more shading.

416
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,407
Hey, turn your face this way.

417
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,527
-Hello.
-Hello.

418
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,826
Are you Ms. Lee Yeon-u...

419
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,369
Ms. Yoon Song-hui?

420
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:57,832
Yes.

421
00:31:58,541 --> 00:31:59,542
Hello.

422
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:07,300
I have to drive to many places for work,

423
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,136
but I hurt my arm.

424
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,430
That must've hurt.

425
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,058
It still looks swollen.

426
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:18,061
And our housekeeper is
on vacation for a while.

427
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:21,773
So I needed someone to help me
with the housework and stuff.

428
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:23,650
I see.

429
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:27,779
The restaurant I co-manage
is under renovation,

430
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,031
so I was looking for a part-time job

431
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,991
to do until the renovation's done.

432
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:35,119
The period of this job was
just right and perfect for me.

433
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,581
Still, this won't work, right?

434
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,292
-I guess not.
-Right.

435
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,339
I have a client to meet.

436
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:49,050
-Please excuse me.
-Sure.

437
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,345
-I'll stay and finish this drink.
-Okay.

438
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,931
Thank you. Goodbye.

439
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:08,820
Did they withdraw the interest
for my loan?

440
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,074
Why isn't this person answering?

441
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,409
You want me to pull out your car too?

442
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:00,788
Yes. I'm on my way to the meeting
with the blockchain company.

443
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,541
I checked the design draft.
Why is the UI so bad?

444
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:07,754
Who would want to use this?

445
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,841
Today's meeting is
just to outline our plans.

446
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,801
Send me a new design in the meantime.

447
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,496
You're a good driver.

448
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:42,872
Thanks.

449
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:51,005
-We're exactly ten minutes early.
-Thank you.

450
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,507
I'll park the car and leave.

451
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,050
-Okay.
-All right.

452
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,385
-Thank you.
-No problem.

453
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:05,895
I should probably pay you.

454
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:08,314
Don't worry.
Our kids are in the same class.

455
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,398
Thank you.

456
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,526
No problem. Good luck with your meeting.

457
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,652
See you.

458
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,093
Call me.

459
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:38,427
Okay.

460
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:40,930
The wind is so hot.

461
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,099
Seriously.

462
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,226
-It's humid too.
-Wait for me.

463
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,563
The study leader has too much to do.

464
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,481
You finished it quite early though.

465
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:51,899
Where are So-ye and Ro-mi?

466
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:55,069
So-ye is at the dance class, and Ro-mi

467
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,238
obviously doesn't want to hang out
with us anymore.

468
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,782
Why didn't you at least ask her?

469
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:02,660
I don't want to. She's annoying.

470
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:04,912
It's so hot.

471
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:05,913
Soo-bin.

472
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,625
We're in a bit of a hurry.

473
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:10,877
I'm in a hurry too.

474
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,545
But I still want to talk to you.

475
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,216
We'll leave you two alone.

476
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:19,552
Good luck.

477
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:28,269
I want to know what I did wrong.

478
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:32,315
You must be like this
because I've done something wrong.

479
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:36,277
Is it because I just left
when I saw your mom?

480
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,239
I've given it a lot of thought,

481
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,410
and that seems most likely

482
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,204
to be what I did wrong.

483
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,539
That's not it.

484
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,667
When I met your mom
in front of your house last time,

485
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:53,669
she didn't seem

486
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,214
too fond of me.

487
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:00,343
That's why I avoided her this time.

488
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,849
But that must have bothered you.

489
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,438
Next time,
no matter what your mom says to me,

490
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,357
I'll talk to her confidently

491
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,026
-and...
-That's not it, really.

492
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:19,237
I just...

493
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,241
suddenly felt uncomfortable
going out with someone.

494
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:27,954
Suddenly

495
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:29,830
during a movie?

496
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:36,462
Suddenly

497
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,422
during a movie.

498
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:43,636
Why? Why all of a sudden?

499
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,888
Is it true?

500
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,181
Was he really

501
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:49,517
using me?

502
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,898
Then it's the movie's fault, I guess.

503
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,359
It made you suddenly feel uncomfortable.

504
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,320
Still, you can let me know

505
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,197
anytime if you remember

506
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,616
what I did wrong.

507
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,160
I'll fix it.

508
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:18,796
Here.

509
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,217
I wanted to give you this that day.

510
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,217
Mom.

511
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,802
-Hey.
-When did you come?

512
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,012
A while ago.

513
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,890
I'll be staying with you
for the time being.

514
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:12,350
The restaurant is being renovated.

515
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,893
-Really?
-Yes.

516
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,561
Aren't you happy?

517
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:19,106
Of course, I'm happy.
This doesn't happen a lot.

518
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:24,820
What's all that stuff?

519
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,281
I'm sorting through some old stuff.

520
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,409
Gosh, I should really throw things away
every now and then.

521
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,578
It's such a mess.

522
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:35,498
No way. I know you'll decide
to keep everything in the end,

523
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:36,832
saying you feel attached to them.

524
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:40,878
You're wrong. I am throwing
them away for real this time.

525
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,050
Unbelievable.

526
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,219
It's been in here all this time?

527
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,596
My goodness, I can't believe it!

528
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:53,891
What do you think?

529
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,267
It's pretty.

530
00:39:56,936 --> 00:40:00,314
I wore this on my first date
when I was 18.

531
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,192
Was it with Dad?

532
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:04,485
Yes.

533
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:10,366
The dress is still the same,
and only I have changed.

534
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,956
This is 30 percent off?

535
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,624
But it's still expensive.

536
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,126
Gosh.

537
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,878
Are you Mr. Oh Han-gyeol?

538
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,296
Yes.

539
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,383
What's this?

540
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,927
Excuse me. What's this?

541
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,388
Excuse...

542
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:39,687
What is it?

543
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,912
Oh, my. What's this?

544
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,584
Mr. Oh, I'm over here.

545
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:03,961
-Come in.
-Okay.

546
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,342
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

547
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:16,932
Ms. Park, you caught me off guard.

548
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:18,976
Do you see me sweating here?

549
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,812
This...

550
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:25,024
never happened.

551
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,571
Mr. Oh, I really don't understand you.

552
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:34,950
Are you really that innocent
or are you just pretending to be?

553
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,328
No. I'm not innocent.

554
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:38,537
But...

555
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,833
this is not about me
being innocent or not.

556
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:47,046
You're not helping Hwi-yeong at all
by doing this.

557
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,173
Hwi-yeong is already doing great.

558
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:52,384
Couldn't you just trust him and wait...

559
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:53,469
Mr. Oh.

560
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,097
Why do you have to make
such a big deal out of it?

561
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,974
I really don't understand.

562
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:01,435
Why can't you just smooth things over?

563
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:10,611
Did you do this to Mr. Kim,
the previous homeroom teacher too?

564
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,780
Did you do this then too?

565
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:15,824
Ma'am.

566
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:20,162
If you did, I think this is
a very serious situation.

567
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,288
So?

568
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:24,375
Did you keep calling Mr. Kim

569
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,793
to find out about this?

570
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,711
What were you trying to dig up?

571
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:31,131
Is that what Mr. Kim said?

572
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:36,428
Mr. Oh. I have just one favor
to ask of you.

573
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:40,808
At least until Hwi-yeong gets into
Seoul National University, can't you...

574
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,436
Can't you please just stay quiet?

575
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,898
Your ridiculous sense of justice

576
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:52,194
may destroy my Hwi-yeong's future.
I don't even want to imagine that.

577
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:55,030
Please, I'm begging you.

578
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:58,701
Mr. Oh? You understand
what I'm getting at, right?

579
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,289
I feel like crap.

580
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,504
What does she take me for?

581
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,096
Please take my order.

582
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:25,519
This world stinks.

583
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,523
How could I fail again?

584
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,377
See? It's not bad, right?

585
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,755
It's a little less lonely

586
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:55,049
-when we drink together.
-Yes.

587
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:58,385
That's right. You got that right.

588
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:03,057
My mom always told me she wanted me...

589
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:06,769
to always be an upright...

590
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:10,481
An upright person.

591
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,942
That's what my mom always wanted me to be.

592
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,321
Mom...

593
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,534
My mom is working hard
and suffering in the countryside.

594
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:26,955
I'm sorry, Mom. I failed again.

595
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,832
Darn it.

596
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:37,132
Why are you crying?

597
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:40,511
You're making me cry.

598
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:41,929
Don't cry.

599
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:46,850
I'm terrible.

600
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:50,396
-No, I'm worse.
-No.

601
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:54,233
I'm so terrible, Mom...

602
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:01,240
-Mr. Oh, are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

603
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:03,200
I called a cab. Wait a minute.

604
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:05,994
-I... I'll take you home.
-No.

605
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:08,038
-Wait a minute, okay?
-Okay.

606
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,498
What's taking him so long?

607
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:15,379
There he is. Mr. Oh, your cab's here.

608
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,172
-Let's go.
-Okay.

609
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,841
I'll take you home.

610
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,801
-Here. Are you okay?
-Yes.

611
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,594
I'm totally fine.

612
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,221
-No, no.
-I am...

613
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,934
-I'm sorry. Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

614
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:31,186
I'm okay. Go first.

615
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,230
-Get in.
-Okay.

616
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:36,567
Where do you live again?

617
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:39,278
Deullae Apartments on Cheonbongsan Road.

618
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:40,779
Deullae Apartments, please.

619
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,948
Take him home safely. Bye.

620
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,452
Bye.

621
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,038
Song-hui.

622
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,958
It's so annoying.

623
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:55,961
Why am I mad?

624
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,505
It's not like I didn't know.

625
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,049
He isn't worth getting mad about.

626
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,051
Mom.

627
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,262
You should've taken a day off.

628
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:07,431
How did you drive with your arm like that?

629
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:10,142
I hired someone to drive me around

630
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,060
and help with housework.

631
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:16,356
-What?
-That's good.

632
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,111
Hold on.

633
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:24,448
What are you doing? I'm not a kid.

634
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:28,327
What? Things like this
become fond memories.

635
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:33,999
There's a kid in my class
who draws these things well.

636
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:35,918
They should go to art school.

637
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:40,464
Is something bothering you?

638
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:43,592
No.

639
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,596
-Mom.
-Yes?

640
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:50,182
Was Dad your first love?

641
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,477
That's right. I was 18.

642
00:46:56,355 --> 00:47:00,192
I guess first loves end easily
and become meaningless.

643
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:02,819
Listen to this kid.

644
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:06,281
Why is it meaningless? First love is huge.

645
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:10,160
It feels like
you're walking down the street,

646
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:14,248
and someone's suddenly throwing
a bucket of water at you.

647
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,668
It's like having some emotion

648
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:20,629
pounce on you.
That's what your first love is.

649
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:24,675
It makes you forget who you used to be

650
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,843
before the water was thrown at you.

651
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:31,223
Hey. That kid in your class who was
forced to transfer... The cute kid.

652
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:33,976
Is he still in your group
for the performance assessment?

653
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:38,313
No, it's over now.

654
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:39,982
Okay.

655
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:42,568
That's good.

656
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,077
What is that?

657
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,079
Peas.

658
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:58,333
Because you're not the same person
you used to be anymore.

659
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,711
The person you used to be
before you met your first love.

660
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:05,299
I wish I could go back to those times.

661
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:09,386
We met when we were too immature,

662
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:12,055
so we ended up breaking up,

663
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:13,849
but I have no regrets.

664
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:16,268
That's just how it is.

665
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:21,481
What am I saying in front of my child?

666
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:24,109
All done.

667
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:26,278
Wash up and go to bed.

668
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:28,905
We finished so quickly.

669
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,245
Come to think of it,
I can't remember either.

670
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,539
The person I used to be
before I met Soo-bin.

671
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:42,002
Excuse me! You in the checkered shirt...

672
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,754
Are you all right?

673
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:53,096
From that moment on, I stopped
being the person I used to be.

674
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:58,769
Okay. Gosh.

675
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,313
Did I gain weight?

676
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,106
I feel sick.

677
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:07,778
You're so handsome.

678
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:10,656
Hold on. Where's my bag?

679
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:13,241
My bag...

680
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,662
My bag...

681
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:30,550
I'd like to drive you,
but I feel bad asking the driver.

682
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:32,761
It's okay. I like this better.

683
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,014
Are you saying you didn't like
having me drive you?

684
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:38,392
Come on. That's not what I meant.

685
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,310
Bye.

686
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,187
-Have a nice day.
-Thanks.

687
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:44,272
That's so funny.

688
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:49,444
Study hard.

689
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:51,071
Get your head on straight.

690
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:01,581
Hello.

691
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,125
Were you hiding there?

692
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:06,420
Yes, I felt a bit... You know.

693
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,131
I brought some young radish kimchi.

694
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:11,883
We should put it in the kimchi fridge
before we go.

695
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,176
The kimchi fridge?

696
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:15,554
You didn't have to.

697
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,498
You guys are still...

698
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,753
Math is next, right?

699
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:52,507
They still are.

700
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:01,016
-What's this?
-What?

701
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:03,769
What's wrong with this?

702
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:04,978
My gosh.

703
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:06,688
Who did this?

704
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,358
What is this? A wire?

705
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,777
Don't. You'll hurt your hand.

706
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,613
What is this?

707
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:25,415
Oh, no. Oh, boy.

708
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,628
-What are you doing?
-What?

709
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:31,254
What are you doing?

710
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:32,839
Oh, sorry.

711
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,049
I slipped.

712
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:36,802
You hid my math book,

713
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,261
wrapped that wire around my bag,

714
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:40,555
and put that ladybug
in my tray too, didn't you?

715
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:41,556
Me?

716
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,308
No, I didn't.

717
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,810
Is it because of Ro-mi?

718
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:46,311
No.

719
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,439
Hey. You should try harder
to make Ro-mi like you then.

720
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:50,816
Instead of taking it out on me.

721
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:51,858
How?

722
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,820
All she does is stare at you
all the time. What should I do?

723
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,242
Jun-u, you're really...

724
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,245
You should leave! Just transfer!

725
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:05,956
Go to another school! Get lost!

726
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,876
Are you laughing? Is that funny, you punk?

727
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,419
-Hey.
-Is that funny?

728
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,171
-Hey, don't.
-Let go of me.

729
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:16,216
-Do you find this funny, you jerk?
-Hey, come here.

730
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:20,011
I have some good news for you.

731
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,848
It's finally time for

732
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:25,976
the school trip
that we've all been waiting for!

733
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,441
Aren't you guys happy?

734
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:35,235
-I hate school.
-It's not just school.

735
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:36,611
It's a school "trip."

736
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,530
You'll be spending
two nights away from home.

737
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:39,656
I love it!

738
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:41,116
This is so annoying.

739
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,827
-Can we not go?
-You have to go.

740
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:46,496
This is an extension of classes.

741
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,665
Then why don't Hwi-yeong and Jun-u

742
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:51,626
arrange the schedule
for the school trip? Okay?

743
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:52,794
Yes, sir.

744
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,340
You all remember the school trip
last year, right?

745
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,384
There's no need for us to waste time.

746
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,471
People who like dancing can prepare
for the talent show.

747
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:04,723
Pil-sang, put your hand down.

748
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:05,849
And...

749
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:08,059
We go on a school trip just once a year.

750
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:11,396
Why don't we throw
some memorable event together?

751
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:17,944
Jun-u. The finals and performance
assessments are coming up soon.

752
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,112
And there's the mock exam too.

753
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:20,864
Let's not waste time
on unnecessary things.

754
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:25,785
Then...

755
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:28,914
Why don't those of us who want
to enjoy our school trip

756
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:30,665
prepare something fun?

757
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:34,336
Not those who think it's a waste of time.

758
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,296
That sounds good.

759
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,131
I agree.

760
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,382
Me too.

761
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:44,471
That sounds okay.

762
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,265
Then those who agree to
Jun-u's opinion can stay.

763
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:48,558
The others can go.

764
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:50,352
What do you think?

765
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:02,364
Soo-bin, thank you.

766
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:04,449
For staying.

767
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:12,791
Ro-mi, aren't you going
to the group study?

768
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:14,292
No. I'm staying.

769
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,169
Me too.

770
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,881
Guys, this is the only school trip
this year.

771
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:22,175
Why don't we all participate?

772
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:25,595
Don't go?

773
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,430
It's time for our study group.

774
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:37,899
Lee Gi-tae.

775
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:41,611
Don't go.

776
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,994
She's right. Don't go.

777
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,287
Gi-tae, you should join us.

778
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:52,747
You're the student life leader.

779
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:03,591
I'm sorry.

780
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:08,638
My god, this is unbelievable.

781
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:09,764
He left.

782
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:30,535
Shall we gather around?

783
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:36,082
Why don't we try something unique
and all wear hanboks?

784
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:37,834
To promote Korean traditions.

785
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,961
Don't you think the vice-principal
will love that?

786
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:44,132
Hey. Are we throwing a party
for your grandma or what?

787
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:48,595
Wearing the same outfit
sounds like a good idea.

788
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,472
Yes, it sounds good.

789
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:52,891
It doesn't sound bad.

790
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:00,774
How about this?

791
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:05,445
We can all wear old clothes
from each of our homes.

792
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:08,698
This is what I wore on my first date
when I was 18.

793
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,408
Our parents' clothes

794
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:12,702
that are filled with fond memories.

795
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,497
That sounds good.

796
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,665
But what should I wear?

797
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,334
Retro cosplay?

798
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:26,091
O-je, wear something cool.

799
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:27,967
Okay.

800
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,469
What is "retro"?

801
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:31,471
English.

802
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:32,639
Prepare something.

803
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:35,058
Our class vice president's idea is great.

804
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:36,392
I like it.

805
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:40,271
It will look really great

806
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:42,565
if we all wear them.

807
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,567
-Right.
-It will look really cool.

808
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:46,402
-Yes.
-It will look so pretty, right?

809
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:48,696
-Yes, it will.
-Hey, thanks.

810
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:58,540
She got off work around this time,
so she's probably still here.

811
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:16,224
Hello.

812
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:24,566
Mr. Oh.

813
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:27,485
Jun-u, why did you come to work so early?

814
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:30,864
Oh, the girl who works before me
said she had to leave early.

815
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,659
Oh, really?

816
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,786
Yes.

817
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:41,166
Is there something you wanted
to say to me?

818
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:43,751
Yes.

819
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:47,505
I heard your meeting
with the kids went very well.

820
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:50,925
You know...
That retro cosplay or something.

821
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,764
You didn't have to come
all the way here to tell me that.

822
00:57:57,223 --> 00:58:01,728
I just felt so proud of you
and wanted to give you a hug.

823
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:02,812
Good job.

824
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:05,857
All right, then.

825
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:19,621
Hwi-yeong, how did your study group go?

826
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,539
I had some more work to do after.

827
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:22,749
What are you doing here?

828
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,878
Nothing much.
I'm just enjoying the breeze.

829
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:32,217
You know, our school trip event...

830
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:34,385
Can't you join us?

831
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:36,429
Everybody talks about it now.

832
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:39,724
It's a competition among all the classes.
If we win,

833
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:42,101
we'll get an extra air purifier
in our classroom,

834
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:44,729
and we each get two gift certificates too.

835
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,689
We came up with an idea today.

836
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:50,026
It'd be great if everyone
in the class participates.

837
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:53,071
You're our class president after all?

838
00:58:57,992 --> 00:58:59,744
Fine, then. Whatever.

839
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:02,914
Suit yourself.

840
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,210
If you grant me my wish.

841
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,382
We came here often
when we were in elementary school.

842
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:13,591
After our private lessons.

843
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:15,510
Behind our moms' backs.

844
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:17,303
We did.

845
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:20,348
And whenever my mom caught me,
she practically killed me.

846
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:24,143
But I didn't know
these game machines were still here.

847
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,311
I know.

848
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,313
Shall we begin, then?

849
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:28,648
-Okay.
-Let's begin.

850
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:29,732
Okay.

851
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:32,360
The game began.

852
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:48,835
Hwi-yeong, what are you doing?

853
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,712
What if your mom catches you
playing games?

854
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:51,921
Just go.

855
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,055
What do you want now?

856
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:02,724
I told you to go.

857
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:03,975
I don't want to.

858
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:06,853
My dad told me

859
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:10,607
that if I saw a sad friend,
then just sit next to him.

860
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:12,525
Without saying anything.

861
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:15,153
That's how we share each other's troubles.

862
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:19,991
Soo-bin.

863
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:23,620
I feel happy.

864
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,336
I just...

865
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:35,590
suddenly felt uncomfortable
going out with someone.

866
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:38,509
Suddenly

867
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:40,470
during a movie.

868
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:59,489
This thought came to my mind.

869
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:05,203
That you must have liked me a lot.

870
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:09,040
You liked me so much

871
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:12,377
that you wanted to show me

872
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:14,962
that text from Jun-u.

873
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:21,511
Even though you knew it would hurt me.

874
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:29,560
Was that a moment's jealousy?

875
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:37,110
I'm sorry.

876
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:41,030
I was just a bit worried about you.

877
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:44,367
I'm sorry too
for making you feel that way.

878
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:48,413
We're old friends.
We're closest friends, right?

879
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:02,385
Oh, my. This playground
looks completely different now.

880
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:05,221
There was only sand
when we were little, right?

881
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:07,890
It's so much better, right?

882
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:14,856
See you.

883
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:18,860
I've granted you your wish, so you'll
prepare for the school trip with us, okay?

884
01:02:20,194 --> 01:02:21,946
Bye. Good night.

885
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:40,173
I can't believe this.

886
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:44,302
What is this?
What did I walk you home for?

887
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,014
I'll give you another chance
some other time.

888
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:51,392
Forget it. No more chances left.

889
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:53,019
Go now.

890
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:56,773
Soo-bin.

891
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,443
Well...

892
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:05,823
-That day...
-What?

893
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:11,829
Actually,

894
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,832
the text...

895
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:16,709
Soo-bin.

896
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:25,593
I thought about it,
but it just can't be true.

897
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:29,222
That you suddenly felt uncomfortable
during the movie.

898
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,061
What are you doing at this hour?

899
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,897
I have a feeling that
there's been a misunderstanding.

900
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:40,608
Because

901
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:43,319
your eyes said something else.

902
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:48,783
What is it?

903
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:56,082
Later.

904
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:04,215
Soo-bin.

905
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:06,717
She says she doesn't want to talk.

906
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:07,802
Hwi-yeong.

907
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,263
Stay out of it.

908
01:04:12,723 --> 01:04:13,724
Soo-bin.

909
01:04:19,146 --> 01:04:21,357
Go home, Soo-bin. I'll send him back.

910
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:40,001
Did you believe this?

911
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:44,130
More than you believe me?

912
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:53,014
I see.

913
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:05,109
I did it for you.

914
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:06,944
I can explain everything.

915
01:05:59,246 --> 01:06:02,375
O-je, do you know where Jun-u lives?

916
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:04,835
Don't you feel sorry for Soo-bin?

917
01:06:05,419 --> 01:06:06,837
You hurt her.

918
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:08,714
I think I'll need some time.

919
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:11,467
Please don't take too long. I'm sorry.

920
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:15,012
Hwi-yeong, I want you to give some thought

921
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:16,931
to how you feel about me.

922
01:06:17,014 --> 01:06:19,600
Thank you for coming here yourself
when you're busy.

923
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:21,560
Wait, Ji-min.

924
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:24,855
While we're at it, let's win!

925
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:26,315
Two!

926
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:29,652
Next up is Go Dong. He's coming--

927
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:31,112
Is that you, Jun-u?

928
01:06:48,045 --> 01:06:50,256
