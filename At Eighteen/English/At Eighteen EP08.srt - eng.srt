1
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,087
Hello, I'm Choe Jun-u.

2
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,506
I'm Soo-bin's classmate.

3
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,093
Yes, I know.

4
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,052
And?

5
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,388
-I...
-Hey, Jun-u.

6
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,098
We're in a bit of a rush,

7
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,350
so let's talk tomorrow at school.
Let's go, Mom.

8
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:00,477
Just a second.

9
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,443
May I talk with Soo-bin for a moment?

10
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,203
About what?

11
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,415
I have something I must tell her.

12
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,418
About the research material?

13
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:28,505
But Chan-yeol gave that to me
this morning at school.

14
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,762
Oh, did she?

15
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,893
We're in the same group
for the literature performance assessment.

16
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:44,437
So I guess he had something to give me.

17
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,652
Did you come all the way here for that?

18
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,363
Well, it's...

19
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:59,702
I was around the corner,
and I saw Soo-bin here.

20
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,750
So, is that all?

21
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,502
Yes.

22
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:13,174
-Let's go.
-Yes, we should go.

23
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,509
Let's go.

24
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:18,555
Goodbye, ma'am.

25
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,738
I guess your strategy failed.

26
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,782
Although I don't know what it is.

27
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,372
Why did Jun-u come?

28
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,167
Hey.

29
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,545
Ro-mi didn't go yet.

30
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,130
Wait for me.

31
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,548
Are they dating?

32
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,551
Why is Ro-mi dating a guy like him?

33
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,511
What if her parents find out?

34
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,972
They're not dating.

35
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,600
What do you mean?
It's obvious they're dating.

36
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,270
If I were her mom, I'd go crazy.
Why date a guy like him?

37
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:10,732
Hey.

38
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,776
Why would you be in the same group as him?

39
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,194
It would be bad for your grade.

40
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,864
Our teacher teamed us up.

41
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,365
Of all people...

42
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,994
If I were Hwi-yeong's mom,
I'd go to the school to throw a huge fit.

43
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:25,121
What were you about to say to Soo-bin?

44
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,789
That you like her?

45
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,583
In front of her mom?

46
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,252
It would've been funny.

47
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,297
Her mom would've fainted on the spot.

48
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,509
See you.

49
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,681
Why like someone if you can't even
tell her confidently?

50
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,767
You don't even have the courage.

51
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,286
You can't help but sigh too, right?

52
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:10,208
I'm so worried.
Why are all the students so smart?

53
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,377
What should we do about Soo-bin, ma'am?

54
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,922
Each student will be monitored
by several consultants,

55
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,300
and we'll make preparations
depending on the course.

56
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:20,885
And this is...

57
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,555
I have something I must tell her.

58
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,100
Oh, about the research material?

59
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,436
Oh, did she?

60
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,750
Asking her out, taking action, timing...

61
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,711
Maybe these weren't the problem.

62
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,756
Maybe I was just not qualified.

63
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,970
Why is it so complicated to like someone?

64
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,770
An open class?

65
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:16,649
We already had one
at the beginning of the semester.

66
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:20,278
I'd like another one just for Class Three.

67
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,488
For your English class.

68
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,740
For goodness' sake.

69
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,825
You can't trust me, can you?

70
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:37,920
Hold on.

71
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,382
I'll use this opportunity to...

72
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,843
Welcome.

73
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,512
Hello, there.

74
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,225
What brings you here?

75
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,687
MR. OH'S OPEN CLASS

76
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,272
What is this?

77
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:57,815
WELCOME!

78
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,442
This is incredible.

79
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,903
I can't believe it.

80
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,071
Mr. Oh.

81
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,156
Keep up the good work.

82
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,325
Wait, you can't step on that.

83
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,536
Gosh, you're really setting an example.

84
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,916
Seriously... Okay.

85
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,420
It's all set.

86
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,437
You can do it, Han-gyeol.

87
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,732
I'll impress all their moms
through this opportunity.

88
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,901
All right, I can do it.

89
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,444
I can...

90
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:52,036
No. You shouldn't rely on medicine.

91
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,871
You got this, Han-gyeol.

92
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,483
I can do this.

93
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,026
I got this.

94
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,070
Okay. I can...

95
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,625
I can... I can do...

96
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,043
I can do it.

97
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,977
Hello, Ms. Park.

98
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,979
The weather is so hot.

99
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:01,731
Shall we go?

100
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,819
Hold on, wait for me!

101
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,489
Class Three, right?

102
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,490
-Yes.
-Hello.

103
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,326
My son just transferred here.
I'm Choe Jun-u's mom.

104
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,702
It's nice to meet you all.

105
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,830
Hello, didn't we

106
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,123
-run into each other?
-Yes, hello.

107
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,124
Hello.

108
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,485
Hello.

109
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,695
-I'm O-je's dad.
-I see, hello.

110
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:51,864
Are you nervous?

111
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:04,752
Ro-mi.

112
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,136
Jun-u!

113
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,184
I didn't think my mom
would know about this.

114
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,978
Your mom looks very young.

115
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,646
She's beautiful.

116
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,440
Where's your mom?

117
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,735
My mom couldn't come
because of O-dong, but my dad...

118
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,990
Mr. Jung!

119
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,616
Da-huin.

120
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,035
Hey, thank goodness
your mom couldn't come.

121
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,580
Gosh, my mom should've totally come
so that she could meet his dad.

122
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:41,789
Stop being ridiculous.

123
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,833
Please come to your senses, Da-huin.

124
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,918
Ro-mi, is your mom coming?

125
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,921
No, she had to go to a conference
in Stockholm.

126
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:53,301
Good morning, everyone.

127
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,847
All right. Hello, parents.

128
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,434
Well... My gosh, Pil-sang.

129
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:06,063
This is Class Three's English open class.

130
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,191
Welcome, everyone.

131
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,866
He seems super nervous.

132
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,701
-He's so hyper today.
-Then

133
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:19,952
let's get started.

134
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:28,002
Gosh, Mr. Oh. Just teach us
the way you usually do.

135
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,087
-You're being so weird.
-Yes, I agree.

136
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,547
I thought so too.

137
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:35,009
All right. Then let's get started.

138
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,554
Sang-hun, the bell rang.

139
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,764
You'll be late for your class.

140
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,684
This means this can be included here,

141
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,353
so number two is the answer.

142
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,525
You see, this is...

143
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,903
Number two can be the correct answer too.

144
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:57,573
But number four works as well
depending on your interpretation.

145
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:02,286
Because of the wording in the question,
it's possible for anyone to be confused.

146
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:03,663
Sir.

147
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,749
Just say you're sorry.

148
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,502
Admit that you're ashamed.

149
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,553
This article poses a question

150
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,722
regarding whether or not

151
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:25,101
our society is led by high achievers

152
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,644
with top grades.

153
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,271
In conclusion, it's important
to cultivate people of talent

154
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,564
in various areas--

155
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,873
Hwi-yeong, let's talk in Korean.

156
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,001
Why? I appreciate how advanced
the level of this class is.

157
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,050
I see. All right, then.

158
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,986
See? The teacher isn't
half as good as his students.

159
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,738
This is why I'm saying
they need an advanced level class.

160
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,574
-Oh, cool.
-They're all at different levels.

161
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,491
Oh Han-gyeol can actually speak English.

162
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,867
What a surprise.

163
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,291
Why am I still speaking English?

164
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,920
Does anyone have a different opinion?

165
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:22,927
Jun-u, what about you?

166
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,725
Oh, right.

167
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,810
As all of you are aware,

168
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,272
the class vice president position
was vacant for a long time.

169
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,025
But Choe Jun-u

170
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,486
was recently elected
as our class vice president.

171
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:43,864
Let's give him a big round of
applause to show him our support.

172
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,035
-Congratulations, Jun-u.
-Congratulations, son.

173
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,120
He's my son!

174
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,914
-The newbie?
-He was forced to transfer.

175
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,918
I...

176
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,550
disagree with that opinion.

177
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:18,232
Sure, one can argue that society is led

178
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,568
by the top one percent of the population.

179
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:26,490
However, that does not mean everyone else
who doesn't belong

180
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,993
to that one percent is a loser.

181
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,413
In fact, those standards

182
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,623
were set by those with power.

183
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,710
When you're in school, it's your grades.

184
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,087
After you graduate, it's how much you own

185
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,464
and what you do for a living.
Things like that.

186
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,009
So, such numbers shouldn't determine

187
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:48,137
who is talented or who leads the society.

188
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:51,849
And I think education should be made
available to all students equally

189
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:57,438
for them to discover their talents
and contribute to society.

190
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,404
That was good.

191
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,533
Then how about we try to come up
with a counter-argument

192
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:12,536
to what Jun-u just said
and write it in English?

193
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,288
-We're okay.
-Impressive.

194
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:16,999
That was so well put.

195
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,335
-I totally agree with him.
-Me too.

196
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,004
Look at you, Jun-u. That was impressive.

197
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,089
How can you speak so eloquently?

198
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,175
It sounded as if
you had a script or something.

199
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:29,887
I know, right?

200
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,222
As if I had a script.

201
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:37,186
Jun-u, I'll ask you to share
your opinion during the open class.

202
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,103
So...

203
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,064
Here.

204
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,523
Just say this.

205
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,863
"I disagree with Hwi-yeong's opinion."

206
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,241
What? How do we know
what Hwi-yeong will say?

207
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,786
I don't know. But,

208
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,455
I bet he'll say
the opposite of what's written here.

209
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,917
But what if he doesn't?

210
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,337
He will. Just trust me.

211
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,172
Seriously?

212
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,428
Jun-u, let's be honest.

213
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,305
When the mothers visit our class tomorrow,

214
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,100
they'll probably gossip about you. Right?

215
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,937
You need to show them.

216
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,273
Show them how amazing you are.
You're our class vice president.

217
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:27,236
Still, scheming like this is...
I don't feel good about it.

218
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,571
Look, kiddo. Sometimes in life,

219
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,908
a little bit of scheming is necessary.

220
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,328
Here.

221
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,916
Memorize it no matter what.

222
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,167
Okay?

223
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,356
Mom. This is my best friend, O-je.

224
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,108
-I see.
-Hello.

225
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,484
Hi, it's nice to meet you.

226
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,653
I'm Lee Yeon-u, Jun-u's mom.

227
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,490
-His dad has been trying so hard.
-Exactly.

228
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,284
-My gosh.
-Soo-bin, isn't your English good?

229
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,453
You guys are almost like native speakers.

230
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,622
Is your name O-je
because you're the fifth child?

231
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,585
No, it's not that.

232
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,962
Hey, Jun-u and O-je.

233
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,131
-Hello.
-Thank you for coming.

234
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,591
-You worked hard.
-No problem.

235
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,384
-May I talk to Jun-u briefly?
-Sure.

236
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,385
Great, thank you.

237
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,220
-Hey, Ro-mi.
-Move.

238
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:37,890
Ro-mi?

239
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,226
I'm Pil-sang's mom.

240
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:44,605
-So you're Pil-sang's girlfriend?
-Pardon me?

241
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,690
I heard your father owns a clinic.

242
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,693
We're in the same league, then.

243
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,362
We own a huge leasing business.

244
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:56,200
I want to marry Pil-sang off as soon as
he graduates from high school.

245
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,701
You're ready too, right?

246
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,578
Am I ready?

247
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:03,540
Oh, you must already know that
he's an only son for three generations.

248
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,293
-Hey, Yoo Pil-sang!
-What?

249
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,756
She's so feisty. Just like me.

250
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,303
Jun-u.

251
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,264
You did a good job. You really did.

252
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,601
That was amazing. You're the best.

253
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:27,898
It's all thanks to you. Thank you.

254
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,984
Well, I guess it is.

255
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,322
This is the beginning of
your journey to becoming a cool kid.

256
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,367
I wouldn't go that far.

257
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,161
-See you.
-All right.

258
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,961
I wanted to ask you about your colleague

259
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,296
at the convenience store you work at.

260
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,382
You mean the guy working night shifts?

261
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,883
Who came to the school the other day.

262
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,094
Yes. Is everything okay with him?

263
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,887
Well, I think so.

264
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,347
That's great.

265
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,516
-Why?
-Nothing.

266
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,437
See you.

267
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,373
-We've met, right?
-Where did we meet?

268
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,667
-The bar.
-The loser.

269
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,294
-Well...
-Loser...

270
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,796
Do you live around here?

271
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,756
No. I work part-time here.

272
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,675
Jun-u.

273
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,635
You know Jun-u, right?

274
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,679
I'm his homeroom teacher.

275
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,973
-Who?
-Jun-u.

276
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,267
Oh, you mean Park Yeong-bae.

277
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,980
I'm late for my night shift.

278
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,232
See you around. Bye.

279
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,694
Why can't I get her off my mind?

280
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,779
Why is she so cute?

281
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,075
Jun-u. You know Jun-u, right?

282
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,077
I'm his homeroom teacher.

283
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,371
Park Yeong-bae's homeroom teacher?

284
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,541
So that loser is a teacher?

285
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,670
Totally not my type.

286
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,215
Gosh, I'm soaked in sweat.

287
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,801
-Because your grandma was watching?
-I'm her precious granddaughter.

288
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:23,639
I didn't open my mouth once during
the class. She must be disappointed.

289
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,183
Why didn't you study harder?

290
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,809
I didn't expect Hwi-yeong to do that.

291
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,519
O-je!

292
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,737
Can we talk?

293
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,949
Maybe after lunch?

294
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,659
No. Right now.

295
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,751
-Go.
-You guys go ahead and eat first.

296
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,338
What's going on?

297
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,423
Did Soo-bin borrow money
from Jun-u or something?

298
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,675
-Right?
-Sorry.

299
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,260
I'm sure there's something going on.

300
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,524
Jun-u.

301
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,573
Soo-bin, where are you going?

302
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,369
Jun-u wants to talk.

303
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,663
The girls are over there.
Have lunch with them.

304
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,396
Sorry.

305
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,189
For what?

306
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,317
For that day.

307
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,739
No. I'm the one who should
apologize for that day.

308
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,241
You came all the way to my place...

309
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,702
That's not what I'm talking about.

310
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:10,787
That day.

311
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:13,999
What?

312
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,337
I'm sorry I didn't call you

313
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,298
after telling you I like you
in the nurse's office.

314
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,969
I wanted to call you,

315
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,013
but my phone...

316
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,641
So I even went to your place...

317
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:35,937
Never mind.

318
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,982
Anyway, it was my first time,
so I didn't know what to do.

319
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:41,777
Your first time?

320
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,822
What do you mean?

321
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,580
You...

322
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:55,999
Or anyone...

323
00:22:57,375 --> 00:23:00,003
This is my first time having a crush...

324
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,260
Sit down. Right now. Turn around.

325
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,347
Look over there.

326
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,479
-Sounds nice.
-Yes.

327
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:18,897
Jun-u!

328
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,315
Jun-u!

329
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,404
What does he keep looking at?

330
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,323
It must be that stray cat again.

331
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,700
An adorable stray cat
has been following him around.

332
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,953
Really? I'll have to ask him about it.

333
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,038
Do you like cats?

334
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:37,999
Of course. I have two at home.

335
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,668
Do you want to take a look?

336
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,878
This one is called Black.

337
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,257
-These guys--
-Sorry, I have to run.

338
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,716
-Sure.
-Bye.

339
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,969
Wait for me!

340
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,680
Well... Have the moms left?

341
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,890
Not yet. They walk pretty slowly.

342
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,770
Anyway, I have to go.

343
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:01,231
Soo-bin.

344
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,025
Later. Let's talk later.

345
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,986
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

346
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,321
Do you want to go to the movies?

347
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:20,584
This Saturday.

348
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:24,379
Let me know if there's a movie
you want to watch. I'll buy the tickets.

349
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,177
Oh, my.

350
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,266
Anyway, call me.

351
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:47,736
What about Ro-mi?
Isn't she your girlfriend?

352
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:50,447
I hate two-timers
more than anything in the world.

353
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,536
I'm not two-timing anyone.

354
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,830
She's not my girlfriend.

355
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,208
I'm not even interested in her.

356
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,834
At all.

357
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,338
There's only one person...

358
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:09,758
that I like.

359
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,185
Call me.

360
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,274
Only one?

361
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,278
By the way...

362
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,781
Yes? What is it?

363
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,866
The moms are gone now.

364
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,295
Maybe I should have recorded him
or something.

365
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,964
I'm getting confused again.

366
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,008
No, Soo-bin. It's real.

367
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,052
It happened for real.

368
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,848
Oh, Ro-mi.

369
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,101
Did something good happen?

370
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,853
What? Not really.

371
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,981
Did you already finish your lunch?

372
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,899
What did Jun-u say?

373
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,905
Ro-mi, I have something to tell you.

374
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,031
Soo-bin.

375
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,702
Something has been bothering me.
Can I talk to you about it?

376
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:19,995
After school today.

377
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,123
Okay.

378
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,208
I don't have any secrets.

379
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,836
The more effort you put in,
the more you see.

380
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,713
They say, her kid's grades

381
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:33,341
and the level of the kid's college
determine the mother's grade in life.

382
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,469
That's right.
Gi-tae's success is my success.

383
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,347
-Oh, my.
-I'm working all the time.

384
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,141
I sometimes wonder what I'm doing.

385
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:43,101
It's so hard to make a living.

386
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:47,022
A Seoul National University graduate
shouldn't say that.

387
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,900
Competent people like you

388
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,194
should work hard to contribute to society.

389
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,405
That's how Korea will become
a better country.

390
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:57,365
"Competent"? That's really flattering.

391
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,368
Please take good care of
this incompetent working mom.

392
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,954
-I'm kissing up to you.
-Oh, gosh.

393
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,748
You're so funny.

394
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:10,211
By the way, you look really young.

395
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:13,631
If you don't mind me asking,
what year did you graduate?

396
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,718
I didn't go to university.

397
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:19,929
I'm 37.

398
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:23,850
Somehow, I ended up giving birth
to Jun-u a bit early.

399
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,227
I guess you were young and reckless.

400
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,979
I think you're right.

401
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,190
So that explains it.

402
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:32,776
That's why your son was so carefree.

403
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,528
By the way, I think we need something

404
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:38,031
like a parent qualifying exam.

405
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:40,784
Just because you give birth, doesn't
mean you're qualified to be a parent.

406
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,035
-Right?
-Yes.

407
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:46,206
Are you saying I'm unqualified
to be a mom or something?

408
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,332
Why do you think that?

409
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,042
Isn't it time for your husband to return?

410
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,710
Isn't he an exchange professor right now?

411
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,296
-Hello?
-He won't be back until summer break.

412
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:57,008
Soo-bin's mom and dad are
both so talented.

413
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,218
-I know.
-I envy her.

414
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:01,221
What's the use?
She should get good grades.

415
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,472
Just like Hwi-yeong.

416
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,266
That's true.

417
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,518
There's an old saying.

418
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,729
After you become 40,

419
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,065
your whole life depends on
how your child turns out.

420
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,609
-That's true.
-That's what counts.

421
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:18,405
I knew it. There's never a day
you don't insult me, is there?

422
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,781
You sneaky rat.

423
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,616
-Such a headache, though.
-Yes, you're right.

424
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,952
Don't you think this cake is too sweet?

425
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,745
-It is.
-It's a bit too sweet.

426
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,497
This tea is too sweet too.

427
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:28,665
Hello.

428
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:29,999
Hello.

429
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,379
Aren't you Mr. Jo's son?

430
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,923
Yes. I came here to tell you something.

431
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,677
Hold on. So are you saying that
we coaxed the math teacher--

432
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,430
I mean, that we persuaded him

433
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:46,266
to give credit
for all choices of Question 15?

434
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:47,976
Yes.

435
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,894
Make things go back to how they were.

436
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,146
Then I'll keep my lips sealed.

437
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,606
Sealed? What are you talking about?

438
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,861
Sang-hun. Mr. Jo...

439
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,363
I mean your father.

440
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:04,159
You know he is doing well at work
thanks to Hwi-yeong's dad, right?

441
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:07,078
-As a son, you shouldn't--
-I don't care about any of that.

442
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,664
Just make things go back to how they were.

443
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,624
Make things go back?

444
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,877
I don't know what you're talking about.

445
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,545
Forget it. Go.

446
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,338
I know everything.

447
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:21,050
About Hwi-yeong stealing Mr. Son's watch

448
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,178
and blaming Jun-u for it.

449
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:27,140
And also about you saving him
from similar incidents before.

450
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,225
I even gathered all the proof.

451
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,105
Are you

452
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,357
threatening me right now?

453
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,528
It's a negotiation.

454
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,199
Seeing that you consider this as a threat,

455
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,075
I guess you do feel guilty.

456
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,119
You rude little punk!

457
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,412
So,

458
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,041
please make things go back
to the way they were.

459
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,006
What?

460
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,674
My mom told me

461
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,260
that Jo Sang-hun met your mom.

462
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,640
I think it's because of
Question 15 of the math test.

463
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,148
Welcome home, ma'am...

464
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,462
That cocky little brat.

465
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:50,181
It's me. Hear me out even if you're busy.

466
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,475
It's about Hwi-yeong.

467
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,687
What a bunch of show-offs.

468
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,273
I can't even stand being around you!

469
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:06,114
Right. From now on,
I'll become a passionate mom too.

470
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:09,200
There's nothing I can't do for my son.

471
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:14,163
What is it you want to talk about?

472
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,626
I like Jun-u.

473
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,171
I don't know why I feel this way.

474
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,842
He's not even that smart or rich.

475
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:28,761
Isn't it funny?

476
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,018
Actually, my family is going through
a rough patch lately.

477
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,186
My parents are on bad terms,

478
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,480
and my dad's hospital is
struggling financially too.

479
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,482
Even my grades are dropping.

480
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,777
Everything is stressing me out,

481
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,989
but whenever I see Jun-u, I feel...

482
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,532
What should I say?

483
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:51,659
I feel better.

484
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,954
I don't know if I expressed that right.

485
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,164
Anyway.

486
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,631
It's like
walking on a rough and dirty road

487
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:08,426
in the rain and unexpectedly
finding a pretty umbrella.

488
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:16,851
I feel like it'll make me feel much better
if I walk under the umbrella.

489
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,525
But I don't think Jun-u likes me.

490
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,695
I think there's someone he likes.

491
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,572
Do you know?

492
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,117
Who Jun-u likes.

493
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,330
I'm not sure.

494
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,375
Shall we eat something else?

495
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,835
You'll feel better
if you eat something sweet.

496
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,088
Do you have something on your mind too?

497
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:47,632
What is it?

498
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,637
I wonder what's good here.

499
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,267
The brownies here are amazing.

500
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:06,693
Hey. When did you get here?

501
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:08,736
Sorry.

502
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,572
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.
I was just taking a nap.

503
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,367
But that's not important right now.

504
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,285
I heard everything.

505
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,374
-My gosh.
-Unbelievable.

506
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,293
-My goodness.
-I knew it. Something felt strange.

507
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:28,673
That's why you looked so uncomfortable
when you were eating that brownie.

508
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,591
What do I do?

509
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,219
If Ro-mi finds out later,
she'll be heartbroken.

510
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,637
What should I do?

511
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:35,805
Yoo Soo-bin.

512
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,099
You deserve a beating first.

513
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:41,644
How could you hide a shocking story
like that from us? You traitor.

514
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:45,481
That's right. You're a traitor
who doesn't care about friendship.

515
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:46,691
I'll beat you up first!

516
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:49,068
Guys, stop. You'll hurt her.

517
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,319
You might wake up her grandma.

518
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,321
Fine, hit me.

519
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:55,199
Hit me all you want,
so I can get a grip on myself.

520
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,243
Soo-bin, you're totally in love.

521
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:58,327
You're right.

522
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,705
Hitting her will be useless.

523
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,417
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

524
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:05,752
Have a good day.

525
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,058
Soo-bin. Do you want to go to the movies?

526
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:28,733
Movies.

527
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,526
Movies.

528
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,450
What does it say?

529
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,580
You look like some kind of cult leader,
Chan-yeol.

530
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,294
Come on, what does it say?

531
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:51,339
Check that.

532
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,382
It's probably my mom.

533
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:55,593
-What does it say?
-Check it.

534
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,428
It's probably him.

535
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,349
I told you, it's my mom.

536
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,852
-Did you decide on the movie?
-Gosh.

537
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,314
Choe Jun-u?

538
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:12,318
"Did you decide on the movie?"

539
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,530
This is awesome. How did you know?

540
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,616
-Are you a shaman or what?
-Maybe this is the path for me.

541
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,702
Did you see that?

542
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,127
Not yet.

543
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,760
Take your time.

544
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,723
"Take your time"?

545
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:44,976
This is unbelievable.

546
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:50,189
I've never seen Jun-u
being nice to someone like this.

547
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:55,528
Are you working? Keep up the good work!

548
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,284
Another couple? Congratulations, Soo-bin.

549
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:04,370
No. Not yet. There's Ro-mi.

550
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,998
What should we do about Ro-mi?

551
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,251
So how did the results come out?

552
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:14,422
Oh... These cards are...

553
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,340
I don't know in detail,

554
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:19,218
-but they look good.
-They do look good.

555
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:22,763
These guys are dancing here,
and there are even fireworks.

556
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,599
Right. This is a good sign, right?

557
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:27,435
Yes... It is a good sign.

558
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,478
Soo-bin, congratulations.

559
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:30,897
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

560
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,900
Congratulations.

561
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:45,870
-Sang-hun.
-What do you mean?

562
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:48,289
Pretend nothing happened?
Did Hwi-yeong's dad tell you that?

563
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,374
Take a seat.

564
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,211
I'm just in a bit of a bind.

565
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,796
It's not a big deal if you try
to see it in a different light.

566
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,924
Why? Are they going to fire you
or something?

567
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,718
I might have to leave my job
because of it.

568
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:04,013
So please be understanding
about it just this once, okay?

569
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,432
Let it slide just this one time. Please?

570
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,851
No, I can't do that.

571
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,229
I don't care whether you get fired or not.

572
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:12,813
Sang-hun.

573
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,444
I'll clean it up for you.

574
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,947
Thank you. Sang-hun.

575
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,699
Sang-hun!

576
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:28,871
So you're saying...

577
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:32,416
I'm getting kicked out
of the class, right?

578
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,712
What are you talking about?
You're the ace of the class.

579
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:40,883
I'm starting another class. That's all.

580
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,469
I want to gather

581
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,513
top students from other schools
including you,

582
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,139
so just join my new class, Sang-hun.

583
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,767
Hwi-yeong's mom is so fast.

584
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,936
And your reaction is even faster.

585
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,981
Sang-hun, don't get the wrong idea.

586
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,775
Well understood. I'll quit.

587
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,820
And don't include my name
in your promotional materials.

588
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:04,407
If you include my name in the list
of your students who got into SNU,

589
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,367
I'll sue you.

590
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:19,922
Hwi-yeong.

591
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:23,175
Sang-hun will also participate
in the upcoming math competition.

592
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,593
Pardon me?

593
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,512
You said he wouldn't be participating.

594
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,431
He applied, Hwi-yeong.

595
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,475
Just compete fair and square, okay?

596
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,899
2ND GRADE TEACHERS' OFFICE

597
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,280
Hey, look at this.

598
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:45,656
Does someone have a crush on you?

599
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,866
Yes, obviously.

600
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,784
You know what?
A guy in 1st grade gave it to him.

601
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,953
-Hey.
-Keep it a secret.

602
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:54,373
-Secret.
-I'm just going to eat this.

603
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:02,173
Sir, please forgive my son
just this one time.

604
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,800
I'll try to persuade Sang-hun again.

605
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,970
If persuading him was going to work,

606
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:11,515
he wouldn't have dared to talk
to my wife in the first place.

607
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,727
She said he threatened her
giving her murderous looks.

608
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,020
How dare he...

609
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,605
I apologize, ma'am.

610
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,774
I'm sorry, sir.

611
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,693
Sir... I can't be shunted off right now.

612
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,946
You know that my eldest daughter
is studying abroad now.

613
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,115
This is a very important time for her.

614
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,124
Please have mercy, sir.
Please help us out.

615
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:48,969
Sang-hun.

616
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,723
You should apologize to Hwi-yeong.

617
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:56,185
Dad, are you crazy? I would've been
top of my year. He stole it from me.

618
00:39:56,268 --> 00:40:00,189
Sang-hun, I'm satisfied
with the marks you got.

619
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:02,191
You know it's not about that.

620
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,776
This is about my pride.

621
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:05,861
It was rude of you
to do that to his parents.

622
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,114
Is that what Hwi-yeong's mom said?

623
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:10,449
Does she even realize
what kind of jerk her son is?

624
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,617
Sang-hun, just let it go.

625
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,869
-It's not a big deal.
-How is it not a big deal?

626
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,497
Dad, you have no pride?
I'll tell everyone about it.

627
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,753
Sang-hun, let it go for my sake. Please?

628
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,464
Stop talking such nonsense!
Gosh, seriously.

629
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:26,966
Every single time... Damn it!

630
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,634
It's all because I'm incompetent.

631
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,970
Dad, why are you saying
you're incompetent?

632
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,055
I'm sorry, son.

633
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:49,780
All right, Jun-u. I want you
to tell everyone in class

634
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,824
these three things
as the class vice president.

635
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:55,411
Look. "Actively encourage
each other's learning activities

636
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:56,871
and help each other out

637
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,874
so that everyone can improve
their grades."

638
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,877
It basically means

639
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,753
that everyone should get along
and study hard.

640
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:06,922
-Yes.
-Such big words...

641
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,799
Right. I'd like you to put together

642
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,010
a preparation committee
for the school trip.

643
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:14,889
And everyone has to submit
travel journals afterward. Okay?

644
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:17,892
What's wrong?

645
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:23,230
Well, you're talking about
managing the class out of the blue,

646
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,774
so my brain feels a bit overwhelmed.

647
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,110
Then just go and read this aloud.

648
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,739
Well, okay.

649
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,575
You can't be like this
when you're the class vice president.

650
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,661
Come on, you're my right-hand man.

651
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,664
That's a bit too much.

652
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,042
Anyway, I just want you to tell

653
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,960
these three things
to everyone in class, okay?

654
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:46,420
Good?

655
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,047
Oh, one more thing.

656
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:58,224
Hey, Sang-hun! Congratulations.

657
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:02,144
His dad has been promoted to
the manager of the branch in Singapore.

658
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,521
Sang-hun, are you moving there too?

659
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:04,605
Yes.

660
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:07,441
It's happening so fast.

661
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,068
Apparently, this is his last day here.

662
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:10,903
Really? I'm sad, Sang-hun.

663
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,905
I know. I'll miss you.

664
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:20,996
Is Sang-hun moving there
because he can't get first place?

665
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,000
What's wrong with that? If he can be
successful, that's all that matters.

666
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,001
I'm jealous.

667
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:28,295
Then ask your parents
to send you to a school overseas.

668
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,672
Your family is rich.

669
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,298
I don't want to move away from home.

670
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,719
Girls, let's go for lunch.

671
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,596
-What?
-I'll beat you girls.

672
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,973
Hey, wait up!

673
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:45,938
-Go ahead.
-Let's go have lunch.

674
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,315
Let's go eat.

675
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:50,109
Let's eat.

676
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,663
Sang-hun.

677
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,918
Don't talk to me. I'm not in the mood.

678
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:12,131
I'm surprised.
I didn't think you'd ever give up.

679
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:15,426
Look who's talking.
You were forced to transfer here.

680
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,014
You are giving up.

681
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,976
You used to tease Hwi-yeong and
constantly go up against Hwi-yeong.

682
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:25,644
What happened to that spirit?

683
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,354
Shut your mouth.

684
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,481
You don't even know anything.

685
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,109
Even I'm still staying here,

686
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:35,779
although I was forced to transfer here.

687
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,745
I considered running away back then too

688
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,539
but holding out actually helped me
figure out a solution.

689
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,003
Had I run away back then,
I would've regretted it forever.

690
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:58,927
I feel great about my decision.

691
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,263
Go away.

692
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,350
Then how about a showdown
before you leave?

693
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,393
With the newbie
that was forced to transfer here.

694
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:15,110
We'll start on the count of three, okay?

695
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:16,362
No.

696
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,030
When that's gone.

697
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,824
Where is it headed?

698
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:23,619
Hey, where are you going?

699
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,829
Singapore... Darn it.

700
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,039
How many laps?

701
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:29,291
One? Two?

702
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,227
-Jo Sang-hun.
-What are you doing here?

703
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,270
-Did really you see it?
-See what?

704
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,814
Me stealing the watch.

705
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:53,857
-What?
-Did you see it?

706
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,243
Did it feel unfair back then?

707
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,214
What? Are they running again?

708
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:55,419
Hwi-yeong.

709
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,672
I think the school nurse is out.

710
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:10,851
Well, is there something I can do for you?

711
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:15,355
Hwi-yeong, wait.

712
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:20,277
Oh, my gosh.

713
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:28,452
What? Don't you trust me?

714
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:30,537
Don't worry. You might not believe it,

715
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,956
but I was a medic in the military.

716
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:34,750
All right.

717
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,336
Gosh, you startled me.

718
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,421
I haven't even touched you yet.

719
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:41,590
Here we go.

720
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:46,053
Gosh, that must sting.

721
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:53,769
There you go.

722
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,271
You're done.

723
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:01,276
Hwi-yeong.

724
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,112
Are you doing okay?

725
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,660
I mean, if something's bothering you,

726
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:12,079
you can always talk to me.

727
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,081
That might take a load off your mind.

728
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,795
Even though I didn't graduate
from a university in Seoul,

729
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:22,422
I have some experience
in counseling others.

730
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:28,470
What do you know?

731
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:30,514
You didn't graduate from
Seoul National University.

732
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:32,266
You didn't even go to a university
in Seoul.

733
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,475
What do you know?

734
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,489
Nothing's bothering me.

735
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,116
Thanks anyway.

736
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:54,371
All right.

737
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,671
Hwi-yeong. Are you doing okay?

738
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,202
Sorry. Did I startle you?

739
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:36,038
No.

740
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,416
Come to think of it,
the study leader has to be the strongest.

741
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:40,834
Carrying things all the time...

742
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:43,128
-I am strong. Give them to me.
-Just until there.

743
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,843
Have you decided on the movie?
We should buy the tickets soon.

744
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,555
Well... The thing is...

745
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:56,433
I've given it some thought...

746
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:58,977
Is that what happened?

747
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,688
Hey. Come.

748
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,907
Why are we hiding?

749
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:15,577
I'm not sure.

750
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:22,501
Anyway, let me know
which movie you want to watch.

751
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,295
I'll carry them to the classroom.

752
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,130
Well...

753
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:36,264
Are you going to give up
on your love because of Ro-mi?

754
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,225
I wouldn't call this love.

755
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,477
Let's call Ro-mi. We have to settle this.

756
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,688
No. Ro-mi is not in a good mood
these days.

757
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:45,023
Her family is in a bit of a situation.

758
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,400
Isn't that just another lie?

759
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:48,735
-She lies all the time.
-I agree.

760
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:50,278
She's like that.

761
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:53,365
We've been hanging out with her
because you begged us to.

762
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:55,117
She used to have no friends at all.

763
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,576
She's so stuck-up.

764
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,287
Stop it. I don't really want
to talk behind her back.

765
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:03,166
Anyway, it's probably best
not to tell her for the time being.

766
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,293
So please help me, okay?

767
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:08,964
I think we should do as Soo-bin says.

768
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:12,217
Fine, we'll help you.

769
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:16,555
On one condition.
Go to the movies with him.

770
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:18,849
Yes. It's not like you guys are
cheating on anyone.

771
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:20,600
Jun-u and Ro-mi weren't
together or anything.

772
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,436
We'll cover everything for you.

773
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:25,355
Gosh, you're only 18 once.

774
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,315
-What is this?
-She's right.

775
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:29,025
Soo-bin, go.

776
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,444
-Will you?
-Go.

777
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,737
Go to the movies at least.

778
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,155
Go to the movies at least.

779
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:34,281
Go to the movies at least.

780
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:35,741
There's nothing wrong with it.

781
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:37,826
-Of course not.
-There's nothing wrong with it.

782
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:39,578
-It's just a movie.
-Exactly.

783
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:41,079
Get one coke too.

784
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:44,082
-Popcorn too. A small one.
-Get just one coke.

785
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,001
I'm so jealous.

786
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,587
Are you jealous?
I'll go to the movies with O-je too.

787
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:50,380
You didn't have to do this.

788
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:52,424
Eat it at home.

789
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:54,384
You must be hungry after your shift.

790
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,556
-I should have packed fries too.
-Hey.

791
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,730
-Good night.
-Good night.

792
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,231
-See you.
-See you.

793
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:09,357
All right.

794
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,029
Jun-u.

795
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,490
What's this?

796
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:19,868
-What?
-Are you and Soo-bin going out?

797
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,203
What?

798
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:25,123
"Soo-bin said this was a secret,
but I'll let you know.

799
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:28,168
Jun-u and Soo-bin are
our class's couple number two.

800
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,377
Exclamation mark."

801
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:33,381
You...

802
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:37,135
Well... It's...

803
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,970
not that serious yet.

804
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:41,932
Da-huin has a big mouth.

805
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,559
Are we really best friends?

806
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,561
How could you keep this big news from me?

807
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:48,855
-I was going to tell you, but...
-But?

808
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,149
Things got a little complicated.

809
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:53,360
Complicated?

810
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:57,322
Oh, that explains why Chan-yeol...

811
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:00,700
Because of that, my head was a total mess.

812
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:04,037
But all the puzzle pieces
have just fallen into place.

813
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:05,705
Jun-u, you're incredible.

814
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,583
You were dating a girl
without your best friend knowing?

815
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:09,960
-That's not it.
-Unbelievable.

816
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:11,503
-You completely blew my mind.
-Hey.

817
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:13,004
-Yes?
-It's not like that.

818
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,798
Yes, it is like that.

819
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:17,676
You got this completely wrong.

820
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:19,135
I didn't get anything wrong.

821
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:21,054
It says everything here.
Do you want to see it?

822
00:52:21,137 --> 00:52:22,138
I just have to scroll down.

823
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:23,765
No. Let's just talk tomorrow.

824
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,392
-Go back in now.
-Tomorrow?

825
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,561
-Tomorrow it is.
-Just go.

826
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:49,541
Soo-bin and Jun-u are
watching a movie together tomorrow.

827
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,459
They're going out now.

828
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,592
Should I have bought some clothes?

829
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:02,679
What should I wear?

830
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,806
Soo-bin!

831
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:07,350
Yes! Coming!

832
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,978
-Come eat!
-Okay! Just a second!

833
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:11,229
Come out!

834
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:15,108
Are you coming?

835
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:18,194
Yes, I'm coming right now!

836
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,952
Gosh, what a waste.

837
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:37,172
What should I wear?

838
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,175
Let me see.

839
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:42,344
Why do all my clothes look the same?

840
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:44,054
What do you think looks good?

841
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:48,767
You don't know? Neither do I.

842
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:53,313
Not this.

843
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:57,901
Not this either.

844
00:53:58,526 --> 00:53:59,986
I have to sleep. I have to.

845
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:03,490
Soo-bin, go to sleep now.

846
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,408
Good sleep makes your skin look better.

847
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,622
Better skin.

848
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:22,902
This is not good.

849
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:26,197
I have to sleep.

850
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,891
Oh, my gosh. My face is so swollen!

851
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:06,905
I came out an hour early.

852
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:09,449
How stupid of me.

853
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:12,035
Why did I come out so early?

854
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:45,485
I still have ten minutes.

855
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,655
Jun-u probably isn't here yet.

856
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:11,970
You're here.

857
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:19,769
Oh. I'm sorry for being late.

858
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:20,854
You're not late.

859
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:22,605
You're ten minutes early.

860
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:24,774
Shall we go?

861
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,235
I'll hold this.

862
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:28,403
Thanks.

863
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:32,157
This isn't cold at all.

864
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:33,658
There's no ice in here.

865
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:36,953
Well... It's been a while
since I bought it.

866
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,121
I guess they all melted.

867
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:42,167
You came early too.

868
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:44,627
-I'll go get a new one.
-No.

869
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:46,754
I don't like cold drinks.

870
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:47,922
This will do.

871
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:50,091
Let's go.

872
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:51,759
Okay.

873
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:08,318
Excuse me. Your tickets...

874
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:09,611
Oh, sorry.

875
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:42,602
This situation is always in dramas.

876
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:03,665
But this popcorn seems a bit too big.

877
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,343
Oh, cell phones.

878
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:38,783
What is it?

879
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:41,369
It's nothing.

880
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:17,780
What's wrong?

881
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:48,186
Was he really using me?

882
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:51,481
I can't let him take her away from me.

883
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:52,774
I can't let that happen.

884
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:54,734
I understand.
You must've been so desperate.

885
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:56,694
-Lee Yeon-u...
-Ms. Yoon Song-hui?

886
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:58,071
Still, this won't work, right?

887
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:00,740
If you did, I think this is
a very serious situation.

888
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:01,991
Do you want another tissue?

889
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:04,410
And don't tell Jun-u
that I know about this.

890
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:05,995
Because that would hurt my pride.

891
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,831
You can let me know what I did wrong.

892
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:10,458
I'll fix it.

893
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:15,630
It's finally time for the school trip!

894
01:01:15,713 --> 01:01:17,674
Why don't those of us who want to
enjoy our school trip

895
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:20,218
prepare something fun?
Not those who think it's a waste of time.

896
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:22,762
You know, our school trip event...
Can't you join us?

897
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:23,888
If you grant me my wish.

898
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:27,892
You must have liked me a lot.

899
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:29,018
Soo-bin.
