1
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:45,587
Jun-u!

2
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,093
Jun-u, are you all right?

3
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,431
Soo-bin.

4
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,355
You're all grown up now,
and I have another family.

5
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,691
I think we each have

6
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,236
different paths to take.

7
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,296
Where have you been?

8
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,107
MOM

9
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,984
Goodness, what should I do with you?

10
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,945
Come on, answer it!

11
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,613
MOM

12
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,507
I need to go to my friend
Chan-yeol's house to do my homework.

13
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,175
Please give me a ride.

14
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,762
Come on.

15
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,344
Can you throw the ball back to me? Hurry!

16
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,231
We're not done with our noodles yet.

17
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,536
Thanks, delivery guy.

18
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:09,624
-Do you...
-You came to our house last time

19
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,251
to collect empty bowls, right?

20
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,254
You have a great memory.

21
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,297
It's because you're good-looking.

22
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,347
You're the good-looking one.

23
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,891
I hear that often.

24
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,663
I hope you grow up
to become a brave man, kid.

25
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,707
Okay.

26
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,253
Jun-u.

27
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,463
Mom.

28
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:03,011
He picked up my ball for me.

29
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:06,639
Dad, let's eat noodles today. Okay?

30
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,852
Go on inside.

31
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,478
Let's go.

32
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,653
Bye, delivery guy.

33
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,071
Thank you.

34
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,000
What is this?

35
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,713
Why does he have the same name as me?

36
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,048
Why?

37
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,719
When I gave him his name,
I was thinking that maybe

38
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,096
it could be a way of asking
for forgiveness.

39
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,017
I was too immature when I had you,

40
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,686
and there were so many things
I couldn't give you.

41
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,733
I wanted to give them all to him
and raise him with all my heart.

42
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,735
As a way to make atonement.

43
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,487
Still, how could you use my name?

44
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,285
You really don't know

45
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,829
how to name your child.

46
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,003
My mom...

47
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,925
still thinks that the time
she spent with her first love

48
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,304
years ago was the most
beautiful moment in her life.

49
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,643
Back when she was 18.

50
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,480
She still misses that moment.

51
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,944
She always told me

52
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,489
that my dad was a kind person

53
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,284
and that he loved me very much.

54
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,789
That's what she always said.

55
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:01,838
That's why...

56
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,719
I longed for that person.

57
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,639
The person who is my dad.

58
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,444
I didn't get to say this earlier.
That's why I came here.

59
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,989
I'm sorry, Jun-u.

60
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:30,783
I'm sorry.

61
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,785
Don't worry.

62
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,290
I will never...

63
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,253
I will never come to see you again.

64
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,635
Goodbye, then.

65
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,679
Jun-u.

66
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:01,355
-Are you Mr. Choe Myeong-jun?
-No.

67
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,275
Are you Mr. Choe Myeong-jun by any chance?

68
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,944
Choe Myeong-jun? No, I'm not.

69
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,865
Dear Mr. Choe Myeong-jun.

70
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,784
Hello, I'm Choe Jun-u.

71
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,078
It's my birthday today.

72
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:19,290
It would've been nice to spend time
with you today, Dad.

73
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,375
But it's okay.

74
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:26,088
Mom said today is
the happiest day of my life.

75
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,466
Dad, I miss you.

76
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,927
I hope we'll meet someday.

77
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,680
Hello, I'm Choe Jun-u.

78
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:38,935
Now that I'm writing this letter,
I don't know where to start.

79
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:43,981
I'm writing you to tell you
that I missed you.

80
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:48,069
I've always wanted to know
what kind of person my dad is.

81
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,073
I'll watch you from afar

82
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,200
only once in a while.

83
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,911
And please remember that I'm Choe Jun-u.

84
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,997
Please remember just that.

85
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,881
The feeling of missing him.

86
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,926
That's all I should remember.

87
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,096
Just that feeling.

88
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,983
-Honey!
-Where the hell have you been?

89
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,277
You completely ruined your exam.

90
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,154
How could you mess it up on purpose?

91
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,490
You obviously knew the correct answers.

92
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,783
Are you out of your mind?

93
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,952
Can't you just take care of it again?

94
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,416
Will Mr. Oh not accept bribes?

95
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,584
What should we do, then?

96
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,669
-Hwi-yeong!
-You brat.

97
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:50,381
You're out to get me, aren't you?

98
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,633
You want to waste away all the money

99
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,510
I've earned by working like a dog.

100
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,345
You're itching to waste it all away!

101
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,222
-Aren't you?
-Honey! Honey, please.

102
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,640
Hit me instead.

103
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,059
-Hit me instead, please.
-All right, Park Geum-ja.

104
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,477
I'll teach you a lesson first.

105
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,104
All you do is drink at home.

106
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,064
How could you not pay
any attention to your son?

107
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,566
How dare you!

108
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,110
Let go. I said, let go.

109
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:12,612
Let go!

110
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,989
-You insolent shit.
-Yes, I am.

111
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,742
It's obviously because I take after you.

112
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,410
I'm human trash.

113
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,370
Why you little... How dare you!

114
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,498
You see,

115
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,127
I've always loathed you
since I was little.

116
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,422
I've always thought
I should never become like you.

117
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:37,762
But I've caught myself becoming like you
without even realizing it.

118
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,598
A monster who stomps
on those weaker than him

119
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,977
and only cares about his own gain,
no matter what it takes.

120
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,188
Human trash.

121
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,608
I've already turned into that monster,
and I can't undo it.

122
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,194
Even if I want to,

123
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:58,324
I can't go back to the time
when I wasn't like this.

124
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,244
I wanted to become
a better person than you,

125
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,498
but I can't anymore.

126
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,708
You shit, how dare you say
such a thing to your father?

127
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:08,959
-Honey, please.
-Let go.

128
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,419
-Please stop.
-Let go!

129
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,176
If you hit Mom one more time,

130
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,388
I won't let it slide.

131
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,857
Hwi-yeong, get out of here.

132
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,485
Run. Hurry.

133
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,680
Hey.

134
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,641
Isn't it her?

135
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,727
Gosh, it is her. Kim Ji-min.

136
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,020
Isn't this that place?

137
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,273
Why are you trying to find
Mr. Oh's girlfriend?

138
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,816
To do something mean to her?

139
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:15,776
No.

140
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,905
I have a plan you don't know.

141
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,949
By the way, why are we whispering?

142
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:23,492
Hey.

143
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,125
-Chan-yeol.
-Yes?

144
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,336
Can I use your phone?

145
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,881
Sure, here you go.

146
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,596
Hi, Jun-u. It's me, Soo-bin.

147
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,097
When you arrive at your part-time job,

148
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,558
check where you usually park your bike.

149
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,477
-This one is good.
-Okay.

150
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,034
Gosh, I'm so sleepy.

151
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:09,330
-Soo-bin, get some fresh air.
-Soo-bin!

152
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:12,374
Goodness, she's studying so hard.

153
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,918
Hey there!

154
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,253
Hey, my gosh.

155
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,007
Have you eaten yet?

156
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,675
Oh, I'm all right.

157
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,763
My gosh, my grandma's hot pot
is super delicious.

158
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,021
I'll be quick. Thanks, guys.

159
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,731
All right, be safe.

160
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,567
I can't believe Soo-bin is doing this.

161
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,237
That is true love.

162
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,781
What do you know about love?

163
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,199
Let's go.

164
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,150
I told you not to do it!

165
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,529
Don't. Don't you dare!

166
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:28,909
Stay away from Soo-bin.
Don't even call her. I have to go.

167
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,248
Soo-bin.

168
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,503
I was at Chan-yeol's place.
We did homework together.

169
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,422
Yes, I heard.

170
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,633
-I'll go wash up.
-Okay. Oh, wait.

171
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,928
Why didn't you tell me
about meeting your dad?

172
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,100
Soo-bin. I don't know

173
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,853
what he said to you,

174
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,646
but it's all a lie.

175
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,232
He's just mad at me because we fought.

176
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,984
Don't worry about it, okay?

177
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,737
-Okay.
-Good.

178
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,281
I'm serious.

179
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:10,409
Your dad and I don't have any problems.

180
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,745
So don't worry,
and just focus on studying.

181
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,663
Okay?

182
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,374
We need to celebrate,
but it's getting late now.

183
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,210
So how about we go on a trip together?

184
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,462
How about Jeju Island?

185
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,214
-Sure, if you want to.
-Okay, great.

186
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,842
Then I'll come up with a plan.

187
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,428
All right.

188
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:33,891
Go wash up.

189
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,127
What's he doing?

190
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,256
What are you doing here?

191
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,517
What's so funny about that?

192
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,269
I think it's funny

193
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,606
that I'm hungry in this kind of situation.

194
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,041
Hi, Jun-u. It's me, Soo-bin.

195
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,543
When you arrive at your part-time job,

196
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,878
check where you usually park your bike.

197
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,517
Jun-u, you must've been surprised
to see me earlier.

198
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,812
Actually, Hwi-yeong let me use his phone,

199
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,940
so I called you in a hurry.

200
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,986
And I happened to overhear

201
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,863
your conversation with your dad.

202
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:56,116
I'm sorry.
I know I wasn't supposed to hear it.

203
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,536
You must be feeling bad.

204
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,998
I know how you'd feel

205
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,751
so well.

206
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,670
It breaks my heart.

207
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,132
When I was feeling sad because of my dad,

208
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,218
you comforted me.

209
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,137
I want to be able to comfort you too.

210
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,432
But I can't be with you.

211
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,435
Writing a letter like this

212
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,646
is the only thing I can do now,

213
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,190
but I'm here for you.

214
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,150
I'm always rooting for you.

215
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,362
In the morning, during the day,

216
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,905
and even when I'm sleeping at night.

217
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,533
So...

218
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:41,328
let's try our best to stay strong.

219
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,957
I miss you, and I like you.

220
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,708
A lot.

221
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,752
From Soo-bin.

222
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:32,379
JEONGHO APARTMENTS

223
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:49,104
Ji-min, how was your day?

224
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,898
Did you study a lot?

225
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:52,900
All right.

226
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,944
Take your time and give it some thought.

227
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,696
I'll wait for you.

228
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,330
I'll wait

229
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,999
until she becomes fine.

230
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,492
Good night.

231
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,029
She's still up.

232
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,009
I will

233
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,511
try harder...

234
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:30,557
to become someone you can depend on.

235
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,811
Good night.

236
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:48,492
Are you on a diet?

237
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:51,369
Da-huin is on a diet these days,

238
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,497
and you're her boyfriend.

239
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,212
Hwi-yeong.

240
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:04,591
Eat.

241
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,929
You weren't like this before.

242
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,432
Why have you changed so much?

243
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,731
Enjoy.

244
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,358
Bye.

245
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,283
Hi, O-je.

246
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,288
Hey.

247
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,923
Why do you look so down?

248
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,883
I heard you and Da-huin made up.

249
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,262
Yes, we did.

250
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,561
Can we talk for a minute?

251
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,605
Sure.

252
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,653
I should have told you first.

253
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,697
Sorry.

254
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,577
You don't have to tell me.

255
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,370
It's up to you.

256
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,626
I'm weird, right?

257
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:26,339
Not really. It's just how you feel.

258
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,593
Yes, but...

259
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,432
I'm not sure what I'm really feeling.

260
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,518
It's confusing.

261
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,856
I was trying to figure it out.

262
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,902
Then, things turned out like this.

263
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,035
Hwi-yeong.

264
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:56,912
Thanks.

265
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,788
-Did you make a phone call?
-Yes.

266
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,791
I didn't pick up
because I thought it was you.

267
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:08,965
I got it yesterday.

268
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,904
-O-je? Really?
-Is this true?

269
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,281
That's so weird.

270
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,909
Hey. Why is it weird?

271
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,869
He just likes another person.

272
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,997
You're even weirder.
Just go back to playing games.

273
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,250
Wow, Pil-sang.

274
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:44,834
That's unexpected.

275
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,261
Hwi-yeong, did you see it?

276
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,267
O-JE HAS A CRUSH ON HWI-YEONG.

277
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:26,918
What page is it?

278
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,253
No idea.

279
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,466
I heard it in the nurse's office.

280
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,510
When O-je said that, Da-huin...

281
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:36,594
Seo-jin.

282
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,179
Will you shut up?

283
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:39,723
That little...

284
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:41,975
It's okay. Let her be.

285
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,184
She'll stop soon.

286
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,145
Hey, don't let her get to you.

287
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,231
Da-huin.

288
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,191
You're okay, right?

289
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,038
O-je.

290
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,333
What happened? I thought
we were meeting this morning.

291
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,376
You said you'd carry my pots.

292
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:11,421
Oh, sorry. I had to take care of O-dong.

293
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:14,049
Mom and Dad went to the morning market.

294
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:19,262
Come with me. There are many things
you should carry for me.

295
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,722
We're going to the gardening room.

296
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,057
-Okay.
-Okay.

297
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,233
You can go now.

298
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,448
-O-je.
-Yes?

299
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,201
Stop feeling bad for me.

300
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,495
You don't have to.

301
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:47,374
And stop wearing that face.

302
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:50,835
You look better when you smile. Smile.

303
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:54,923
Okay.

304
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:56,716
You should go.

305
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:05,350
Gosh, what is this feeling though?

306
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,102
I still get flutters.

307
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,275
JUNG O-JE IN CLASS THREE
LIKES MA HWI-YEONG,

308
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,152
THE GUY WHO FABRICATED HIS GRADES!

309
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,207
Hey, Jun-u.

310
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,419
Mr. Oh.

311
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,337
Is something wrong?

312
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:43,012
Why do you look so serious?
You're making me nervous.

313
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,389
Go on and tell me.

314
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,434
I...

315
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,729
visited an academy.

316
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,897
Why?

317
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,318
You know, that ladybug...

318
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,238
A ladybug academy?

319
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,824
What does that place teach?

320
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,535
Drawing.

321
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,162
Drawing?

322
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,836
By drawing, do you mean...

323
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:20,508
You're saying that you've decided
what you want to do in university?

324
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,556
Drawing, art,

325
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,683
and art school.

326
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:36,024
Hooray!

327
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:40,403
So, does that mean you're
really going to start preparing?

328
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:41,738
That's a great idea.

329
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:44,115
I knew it when I saw you
draw that ladybug.

330
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:47,160
You've got talent. Really.

331
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:51,247
Thank you. But I haven't decided
for sure yet...

332
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:54,876
No. You should hurry up and start
before it's too late.

333
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:59,631
Well, shouldn't you learn
thoroughly, from the basics?

334
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,343
Yes. That's why I've been
searching around here and there,

335
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,514
but it's quite difficult,
considering my situation.

336
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,229
I know.

337
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:19,150
Right, I have a friend
from my military service,

338
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:22,904
and he teaches students preparing
for art school. Do you want me to ask him?

339
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,075
Well, he's not as handsome as me,
but he's good.

340
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:30,245
I heard he's quite famous in that field.

341
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:36,000
I know, preparing for art school
is not an easy task.

342
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,628
Still,

343
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:40,797
I will help you.

344
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,927
Will that be okay?

345
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,012
Of course.

346
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,516
Thank you.

347
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:58,565
I'll put in a word for you,
so go visit that academy.

348
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:01,901
You need to push forward confidently
once you've made up your mind.

349
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,487
Jun-u, let's do this. Okay?

350
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:13,955
Soo-bin.

351
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,462
Did you not get any sleep last night?

352
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,176
I didn't get any sleep either
after reading your letter.

353
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,137
I was so touched.

354
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,682
It was nothing.

355
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:36,603
I thought about what I could do for you,

356
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,355
and that was the only thing
that came to mind.

357
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,818
Shall we do it again when
we have something to say next time?

358
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:47,614
Sometimes when it's too difficult
to talk about something.

359
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,409
Okay.

360
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:54,621
Soo-bin.

361
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:57,916
I have a goal now.

362
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,168
About what I'll do from now on.

363
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,128
What is it?

364
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,922
I haven't thought of the details yet,

365
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,049
but since I like to draw,

366
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,761
I'll set it as my goal and study for it.

367
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,430
Really?

368
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,223
I'm glad to hear that.

369
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:18,770
I really like it when you draw too.

370
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,689
I'll sincerely root for you.

371
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,652
It's all thanks to you.

372
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,530
You're the one who made me
want to live a better life.

373
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:32,909
And even have a dream.

374
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,495
You have

375
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,581
changed so much.

376
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:41,417
I'm proud of you.

377
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:43,628
I know.

378
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,214
Oh, right.

379
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:47,465
What?

380
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,177
I promised your mom that
I wouldn't meet you like this.

381
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,685
I should keep that promise.

382
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,272
You can go first.

383
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:05,483
Okay.

384
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,489
Jun-u.

385
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,534
You are

386
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,078
a really good person.

387
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,134
So-ye.

388
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:36,264
I came because I thought
you'd skip lunch if I didn't come.

389
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:38,933
What is it you want to say?

390
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,686
I wanted to thank you
for saying that to Sang-hun last time.

391
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,021
Okay.

392
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:44,564
See you.

393
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,483
So-ye.

394
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,404
I'm trying really hard.

395
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,239
To become a person
you won't be ashamed of.

396
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,158
So please give me another chance.

397
00:33:57,493 --> 00:34:00,079
Please give me another chance.

398
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,958
What about the exams? Did you do well?

399
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,638
Aren't you going to take that?

400
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,437
I heard the rumor about you.

401
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:27,440
You're free to like whomever you want,

402
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,484
but don't get me involved in it.

403
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,571
Don't worry, that won't happen.

404
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:36,157
It's just a personal problem.

405
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:43,206
Sir, do you know of anyone who teaches

406
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:46,250
students preparing for art school?

407
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,752
Mr. Oh!

408
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:48,961
Mr. Oh, this is an emergency.

409
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,214
Oh, hi. You can go first.

410
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:58,763
People from the Office of Education
are here.

411
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,306
Darn it.

412
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,350
Gosh, big news.

413
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,103
People from the Office of Education
came to get Hwi-yeong.

414
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:06,604
I can't believe it.

415
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,773
It's over for Hwi-yeong now.

416
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,024
This is so scary.

417
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,075
Guys, move over.

418
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,833
Hey! What are you guys doing?

419
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,751
Go back to your classrooms. Now!

420
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,633
Sang-hun, go to your classroom. Now.

421
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,636
Yes, sir. As you wish, sir.

422
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,267
Hwi-yeong.

423
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,853
Were you aware
that your grades were fabricated

424
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,187
in the second semester last year?

425
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,899
Wait, I can explain.

426
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,610
Back then, Hwi-yeong didn't know--

427
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:57,530
CHANGES ON THE ANSWER SHEET

428
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,490
We want Hwi-yeong to answer.

429
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,787
I found out recently.

430
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,208
I admit all the allegations.

431
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,420
I'll cooperate with the investigation.

432
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,467
If it's found true that
your grades were fabricated,

433
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:21,971
yourself, the teacher who was
involved in the tampering,

434
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:25,892
and even your parents will be punished.

435
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,019
Lastly,

436
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:32,523
you will be given zero points
for that subject.

437
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,646
Hey, you must be feeling good about this.

438
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,649
Was it you?

439
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,443
What? Do you think I did it?

440
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:19,070
Oh, boy.

441
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,280
I should've done it.

442
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,324
But sadly, it wasn't me.

443
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,787
I'm telling you the truth.

444
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,247
What's with you, Jun-u?

445
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,874
Has the hatred turned
into friendship or what?

446
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,339
That serves him right.

447
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,051
He should be punished

448
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,053
for what he did.

449
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:47,306
I was just wondering if you did it.

450
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:13,708
Hello, Dad? It's me, Sang-hun.

451
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,883
What the...

452
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,762
Cut the nonsense.

453
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,734
Natural resources are subject to change.

454
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,361
The technology standards or...

455
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,040
Take petroleum for example.

456
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,334
In the past, we didn't have
any technology to utilize it,

457
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,210
so we just left it as it was.

458
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:01,714
But how about now?
It's a crucial natural resource for us.

459
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:04,008
That's how the values can change.

460
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,384
And natural resources...

461
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:10,973
Sir.

462
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,350
Yes, Mr. Oh.

463
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:14,810
How could this happen?

464
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,854
I really didn't see this coming.

465
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:21,901
God, this will ruin
my 25-year teaching career.

466
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,196
I won't get fired, will I?

467
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,614
What do I do if that happens?

468
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,157
I'll never become a principal.

469
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,825
No. That won't happen.

470
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,577
Let's cooperate with the investigation

471
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,621
and sort things out.

472
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,295
I've done so much for this school.

473
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,547
They won't do that to me.

474
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,647
Mr. Oh, I'd like to consult you
about something.

475
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,651
Oh, really?

476
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,861
Sure, anytime. Are you at school now?

477
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:09,532
I'd like to meet you outside of school.

478
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,869
Sure, sounds good. Where?

479
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,708
Hey, Chan-yeol.

480
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,795
I'm here. Are you not here yet?

481
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,842
Mr. Oh, did you meet her?

482
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,556
You little... I'm going to scold you.

483
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:39,812
Ji-min.

484
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,860
I don't want to see you again.
Please leave.

485
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:49,738
I will leave.
But can we talk for a minute?

486
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:50,906
Mr. Oh.

487
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,868
You see, I'm really

488
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,744
not good enough for you.

489
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,956
I'm working part-time jobs
because I can't get a full-time job.

490
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:02,668
And I practically have to support
everyone in my family.

491
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,296
You have a stable job,

492
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:07,882
and you're a good guy,
so I want to keep dating you.

493
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:11,218
But the more I let this go on,
the more insecure I'll feel.

494
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,220
What are you talking about?

495
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,472
Don't think that way.

496
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:19,018
I'm sorry. I have to get back to work.

497
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:21,395
Enjoy this drink and leave.

498
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:23,439
Ji-min.

499
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,950
Thanks, Chan-yeol. I met her.

500
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:40,164
Good luck this time, Mr. Oh.

501
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:45,461
Gosh, what's wrong with my eyes?

502
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,478
Why is that a problem?

503
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:07,691
We can just date. Why does it have to be

504
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:10,069
so complicated?

505
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,471
What's up?

506
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,723
Right. You're working, obviously.

507
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,351
It turned out to be me.

508
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,396
The informant.

509
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:47,523
It was me.

510
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:57,157
I called my dad earlier just to be sure

511
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,909
and found out he's the one who did it.

512
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:04,873
It's all in the past.
Why is he digging it up now?

513
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,500
What about your dad's job?

514
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,712
Haven't you been quiet about it
because of your dad's job?

515
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:12,131
He quit.

516
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:15,426
He said he can retaliate now
because he has nothing to lose.

517
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,220
I wish he had told me.

518
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,806
And why quit his job?

519
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,977
Had he told me back then, I would've...

520
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,562
God, I don't know.

521
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:28,272
Whatever, this is actually good.

522
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:30,941
I feel so much better now.

523
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:34,862
What? What is it?

524
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,573
You don't feel better, right?

525
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,743
Yes, I do.

526
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,536
I totally feel better now.

527
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:45,331
Gosh, it's so gratifying.

528
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,257
What do I do now?

529
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:58,719
You should get going.

530
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:00,846
Yes.

531
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:02,389
I should go home.

532
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:04,850
What?

533
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:06,435
Hey, Jun-u.

534
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,270
Gi-tae, what brings you here?

535
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,730
Have you seen Hwi-yeong by any chance?

536
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,482
This jerk's going on
about Hwi-yeong again.

537
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:12,566
It's not that.

538
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:15,778
He was acting weird earlier.

539
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:19,573
He sent me a text saying sorry,
and I haven't heard from him since.

540
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:21,784
He didn't even go to the academy.

541
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:24,828
So what?

542
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:30,542
Well, I was just wondering if he came by.

543
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,169
I'll be off, then.

544
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:40,636
Bye.

545
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:42,554
Bye.

546
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:03,867
Ma Hwi-yeong...

547
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:06,787
Okay, let's find him.

548
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,374
He's probably gone home
after wandering for a little while.

549
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:12,835
-I mean, it's pouring now.
-Gosh, I'm so worried.

550
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:15,045
His phone is off too.
What if something happened to him?

551
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:18,424
I'm sure he's fine.
Don't make such a fuss.

552
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:25,472
Hey, O-je.

553
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:27,516
Hey, what are you up to?

554
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:29,476
I'm...

555
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:32,396
Hwi-yeong?

556
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:35,441
I'm sure he'll go home.

557
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:50,038
Lastly, you will be given zero points
for that subject.

558
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,967
That bastard. We worried for nothing.

559
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,430
Hwi-yeong, let's go back.

560
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,725
Let go. Let go of me.

561
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,727
Let go, you bastard!

562
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,771
He still hasn't come to his senses.

563
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,899
Now we know he's fine. Let's go back.

564
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,740
Just let a piece of trash like me
be smashed to bits.

565
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:26,116
What?

566
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,161
Are you happy watching me fall?

567
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:30,829
Is this fun for you?

568
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:33,415
Get lost, you bastard!

569
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:38,921
You guys go back first.

570
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:46,512
Gi-tae, let's go!

571
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,354
What are you doing here?

572
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:57,481
The guys were worried about you.

573
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:59,066
What do you care?

574
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,778
You're still a coward. You know that?

575
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:05,822
Are you trying to be forgiven this way?

576
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,783
I'm not trying to be forgiven.

577
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,621
You're still full of pride.

578
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,417
Then what's torturing you so much?

579
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:22,589
Is it so humiliating to say sorry to me?

580
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:28,220
Is it so hard to own up
to what you did wrong?

581
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,934
Do you know why I'm just standing by
and watching you?

582
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:38,188
It's because I feel
genuinely sorry for you.

583
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:46,154
You're suffering

584
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:50,033
because you know you did wrong.

585
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,788
Stop running away and face it.

586
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:58,834
Take responsibility
and put things right yourself.

587
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,421
Stop being such a coward.

588
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:09,219
This is your last chance.

589
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:15,225
Damn it!

590
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:28,447
JUN DAL'S REAL BIRTHDAY

591
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,574
Is this your birthday?

592
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:32,242
Yes.

593
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:35,579
But there was a different date
on the class bulletin board.

594
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:39,166
My mom registered my birth late.

595
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:46,006
Let's celebrate your real birthday
together this year.

596
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:48,258
Okay. I can't wait.

597
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,596
JUN DAL'S REAL BIRTHDAY

598
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,931
It's Jun-u's birthday today.

599
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:01,897
Hi.

600
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,584
-Did you get home safely last night?
-Yes.

601
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:34,096
Guys.

602
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:35,931
Hey.

603
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,474
I have something to tell you all.

604
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:42,813
I'll tell Mr. Oh that I'm stepping
down as class president today.

605
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,899
I don't think I need to explain
why I don't deserve the position.

606
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:51,196
And I believe Jun-u will
manage the class just as well.

607
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,158
I'm sorry I can't finish my term.

608
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,162
Hey, Hwi-yeong.

609
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:00,747
Who says you can quit?

610
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,833
Shouldn't you ask our opinions too?

611
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,426
I don't think that's necessary.

612
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:39,870
Hwi-yeong.

613
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,539
Can we talk?

614
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:44,624
You don't have to comfort me.

615
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,209
I'm not trying to comfort you.

616
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:48,253
I'm just worried about you.

617
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,173
You don't look okay right now.

618
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:56,303
"Little Boy Hwi-yeong."
Let's not do that anymore.

619
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,847
We should stop pretending we're close.

620
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:01,349
Why do you say that?

621
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:03,977
Yes, I was angry at you.

622
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:05,437
I couldn't understand you.

623
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:08,190
But we're still friends.

624
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,567
I can't just sit back.

625
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,446
It gets like this in summer.

626
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,075
I'm fine.

627
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:21,036
Hwi-yeong.

628
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:22,996
Thanks for your concern though.

629
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:31,713
Let him be.

630
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,467
Let him continue to be a stuck-up kid.
That's Hwi-yeong.

631
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,596
Don't worry too much, Soo-bin.

632
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:43,058
She's right.
Focus on protecting your love.

633
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:49,731
Guys, can you do me a favor?

634
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,317
What is it?

635
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:57,322
Actually, it's Jun-u's birthday today.

636
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:01,159
There's something I wanted to get him.
If I buy it,

637
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:03,286
can you guys hand it over to him?

638
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:05,038
You're such a coward.

639
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,749
Can't you even give him
a birthday present yourself?

640
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:10,544
Why don't you just
completely give up on him?

641
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:13,463
Why? Do you still want him?

642
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,090
That won't happen. Never ever.

643
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:16,383
I wouldn't say "never ever."

644
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,176
Really. Never ever.

645
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,763
Ro-mi is right.
It's his birthday after all.

646
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:24,474
You should give him your present yourself.

647
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:26,059
Totally.

648
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:29,729
Look, guys.

649
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,484
Is it time for
Chan-yeol's Special Unit again?

650
00:52:40,156 --> 00:52:42,158
Please. Just this once.

651
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,786
-It's her boyfriend's birthday.
-That's right.

652
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,788
It's his first birthday
since they started going out.

653
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,498
We beg you, ma'am. Please.

654
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,000
-Please.
-You're so petty.

655
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:52,419
How much do you want? We can pay you.

656
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:53,837
-Hey!
-Hey! Seriously.

657
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:54,754
I'm sorry.

658
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,048
I can read tarot cards for you.

659
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:59,843
I'm very good at it.
Or is there anyone you want to find?

660
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:01,970
-We can find anyone.
-She's right.

661
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:03,263
Sorry.

662
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:06,725
Have you never been in love?

663
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:08,643
-Stop.
-I mean...

664
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:11,771
If you have, you should understand
how Soo-bin would feel right now.

665
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:12,939
She's right.

666
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,110
-Please.
-Follow me.

667
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:22,490
-Hey!
-I can't believe this.

668
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:25,785
-Let's hurry!
-We have only an hour.

669
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,704
-We don't have time. Let's start.
-Okay.

670
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:28,955
What are you guys doing?

671
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,583
You should look pretty
when you meet your boyfriend.

672
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:35,003
She's right. We'll make you look
so pretty that Jun-u passes out.

673
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:36,796
Hurry up.

674
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:38,632
-Oh, my.
-Here we go.

675
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:40,175
You're scaring me.

676
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:48,099
-It hurts.
-Just put up with it.

677
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:50,185
-What?
-Do this.

678
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,355
Why isn't Ro-mi here yet?

679
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:55,899
That unreliable girl must have bailed out.

680
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:57,901
What do you take me for?

681
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:00,654
Ta-da.

682
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,449
-It's so pretty.
-You have good taste.

683
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:05,575
It's pretty.

684
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:09,037
When Soo-bin comes in, he'll come out...

685
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,830
Why isn't O-je here yet?

686
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:15,043
-Guys.
-You're late.

687
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:16,544
Give me the candles.

688
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:19,339
-Hurry.
-Come on.

689
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:26,221
ART SCHOOL PREPARATION COURSE

690
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:44,072
-Hi, Mom.
-Jun-u, I'm sorry.

691
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:49,119
It's your birthday, and I didn't
get to make seaweed soup for you.

692
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:50,954
It's okay.

693
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:53,164
It's no big deal.

694
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:54,791
Don't worry about it.

695
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,334
How are you doing?

696
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:58,294
Is the restaurant doing well?

697
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:00,755
Yes, of course.

698
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:03,633
You're leaving for work early today.

699
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:06,511
Yes. I need to stop by somewhere.

700
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:09,681
Okay, Mom. I'll call you in the evening.

701
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:12,892
Okay, my baby. Work hard.

702
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,269
Happy birthday.

703
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,190
Gosh.

704
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:30,618
Two, three.

705
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:33,288
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

706
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:35,498
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

707
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:38,084
-Happy birthday dear Jun-u
-Happy birthday dear Jun-u

708
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,462
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

709
00:55:42,338 --> 00:55:44,966
-Here.
-How did you guys know?

710
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:47,177
-Blow them out.
-Many happy returns.

711
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,845
-Happy birthday.
-Congratulations.

712
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:51,931
Thank you.

713
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:54,184
Thank you, guys.

714
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:56,770
We didn't get any gifts, though.

715
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:57,896
That's fine.

716
00:55:57,979 --> 00:56:01,733
However, there is one gift
that all of us prepared together.

717
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:05,403
All right, then. Come on in!

718
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:28,885
Jun-u.

719
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:43,608
Happy birthday.

720
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,035
You shouldn't be here.

721
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,204
-Let's go.
-Hold on.

722
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:58,873
It's your birthday today.
Consider it a special chance.

723
00:56:58,957 --> 00:56:59,958
-That's right.
-Yes.

724
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:01,751
Jun-u, just stay with her for a bit.

725
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,545
Oh, boy, we should get going.

726
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:05,672
-Right.
-We should leave now.

727
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:07,549
-I'll leave the cake here.
-Let's go.

728
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:10,135
-See you.
-Hold this.

729
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,137
Let's go.

730
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:13,596
-See you.
-Bye.

731
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:15,223
Bye.

732
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:18,685
-Let's go.
-Hey, watch your step.

733
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:32,615
Don't worry, I'll go home soon.

734
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:40,790
Where's her bodyguard?

735
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:43,168
She said she'd be counting the time.

736
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:45,336
Did she just leave?

737
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,005
I guess she read our minds.

738
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:49,048
Then shall we go to my dad's restaurant?

739
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:50,341
It's my treat.

740
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:53,011
-Sure.
-Gosh.

741
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:54,804
Da-huin, don't you even feel
uncomfortable?

742
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:57,849
What's the big deal?
We're just eating tteokbokki, right?

743
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,642
Let's go.

744
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:04,689
Will those two be all right?

745
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:10,361
I wanted to give you a birthday gift
and cheer you on.

746
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,164
Thank you.

747
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:29,047
Let's go now. I'll walk you home.

748
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,008
Let's stay for a while longer.

749
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:33,927
I came all the way here.

750
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:37,847
Let's go.

751
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:43,102
After I see you opening this.

752
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:50,109
You promised your mom
not to come here again.

753
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:55,907
I'll put this inside.

754
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:17,720
Do you know

755
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:20,682
how hard it was for me to come here?

756
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:28,648
I felt really afraid and guilty too,

757
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:32,110
but I still mustered up the courage
to come here.

758
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:34,862
It's your birthday today.

759
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,827
I was worried you'd be alone.

760
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:45,373
Isn't it okay for me to be with you today?

761
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:06,644
I'll take you home.

762
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:10,732
Fine.

763
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,192
I can go alone.

764
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:14,402
Soo-bin.

765
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,490
Do you know how much
I'm holding back and enduring

766
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:22,201
this situation right now?

767
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:28,458
You know well.

768
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:35,715
But if you come here,

769
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:39,719
what does that make me?

770
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:48,436
It's really hard for me too,
but I'm still enduring it.

771
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:50,021
So...

772
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:23,179
I'm sorry.

773
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:14,397
Thank you for today.
It was the best birthday of my life.

774
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,232
-Really?
-Mr. Oh sent me here.

775
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:17,191
Are you Choe Jun-u?

776
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:19,068
You're really talented,
just like Han-gyeol said.

777
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:20,820
Let's split them up.

778
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:23,281
Could you transfer Jun-u
to another school?

779
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:25,283
Please do it for me.

780
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:27,994
Soo-bin, I'm having a really tough day.

781
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,829
I know it's tough for you now,

782
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:32,874
but after time passes, don't you think
things will become better?

783
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:34,959
Ji-min, whether you see me or not,

784
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:37,170
that's up to you to decide.

785
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:42,258
Why didn't you tell me all this time?

786
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:44,802
Jun-u.

787
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:49,974
Since I knew you'd be hurt.
How could I tell you?

788
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:53,060
Leaving you like this
until you got to this state.

789
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:54,562
That's what I regret the most.

790
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:56,773
What in the world is this emotion?

791
01:02:56,856 --> 01:03:00,109
I hated him so much,
and I still can't forgive him. But...

792
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:01,194
Hwi-yeong.

793
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:09,827
