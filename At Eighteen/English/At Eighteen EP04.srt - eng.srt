1
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,104
It was in my pocket.

2
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,819
It's clean. It's just a little crumpled.

3
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,200
What a surprise

4
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,160
to see you carry this around.

5
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:20,330
Since I live alone, I should carry it
around to look better.

6
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,623
That's what my mom told me.

7
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,794
It'll make you look worse
if you carry it around like this.

8
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,629
You should iron it or something.

9
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,757
I'm usually good at ironing,

10
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,885
but my mom took the iron with her.

11
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,721
She's living in the countryside
because of her work.

12
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,768
That explains it.

13
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,895
That's why your uniform and clothes

14
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,189
always seemed all wrinkled up and dirty.

15
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,066
Since you don't have an iron?

16
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,194
It's not that dirty.

17
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,780
They said it looked okay.

18
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,991
Who said that?

19
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,368
What?

20
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,831
The people at school.

21
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,541
The girls.

22
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,089
Gosh, you pretended not to know
anything and be indifferent,

23
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:14,134
but you were actually enjoying
what the girls were saying, right?

24
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,886
No, that's not what I meant.

25
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,764
I didn't want to hear them,

26
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,808
but I couldn't help overhearing.

27
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,269
And they all have loud voices, you know.

28
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:25,854
So that's why...

29
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,701
How come you're not asking?

30
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:41,703
What?

31
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,373
About what's wrong.

32
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,334
Why I was walking around like this.

33
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,798
How come you're not asking me?

34
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,511
Why I'm such a mess?

35
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,060
You probably got into a fight again.

36
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,354
Again?

37
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,816
I don't go around fighting and stuff.

38
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,777
If you didn't fight, then what?

39
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,905
Did you work out? Play a game?

40
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:24,370
Let's just say
it was some kind of matchup.

41
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,750
Are you sure you weren't beaten up?

42
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,418
What do you take me for?

43
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,671
I can't get into detail right now,

44
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,256
but anyway, that's what happened.

45
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,385
Aren't you going to answer that?

46
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,853
Oh, right.

47
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,737
-Yes?
-Hey! Where are you?

48
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,003
Hey, how could you forget
to go to your part-time job?

49
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,839
I was caught up in an emergency.

50
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:32,272
Wait, why are you taking me with you?

51
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,482
It's too far to walk,
and it might rain again.

52
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:35,650
Hold on tight.

53
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:36,818
Okay.

54
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:48,371
Why did you send me an unfinished script?

55
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,290
"Not because I'm afraid of ghosts..."

56
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,458
What comes after that? Tell me.

57
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,336
Aren't you going to answer me?

58
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,418
Hello.

59
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,128
What are you two doing?

60
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,423
Yeong-bae, are you late
because you were flirting with...

61
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,384
What's wrong with your face?
Who did that to you?

62
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,345
-Did you do it?
-What?

63
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:50,016
No, I fell off my bike.

64
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,267
Both of you?

65
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,518
-No.
-No.

66
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,855
You two are dating, aren't you?

67
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:57,565
-No.
-No.

68
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,243
Soo-bin.

69
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,079
Hey, Hwi-yeong.

70
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,580
Where were you?

71
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,582
Your mom was really worried.

72
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,334
Did you go to my house?

73
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,169
Yes. To go to the academy together.

74
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,712
Congratulations on passing the test.

75
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,673
Do I have to go today?

76
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,009
Of course. You need to start right away.

77
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,430
Jun-u, did you get into a fight again?

78
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,390
Right? I was right.

79
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,894
Tell me if you're in trouble. Anytime.

80
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:37,605
Why?

81
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,734
Since we're in the same class.

82
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:44,362
We should help each other out
whenever we're in trouble.

83
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,743
I'm not sure. I don't want to.

84
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,998
Suit yourself. See you tomorrow.

85
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,584
-Let's go, Soo-bin.
-Okay.

86
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,717
Jun-u.

87
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,554
Send me the last part of the script, okay?

88
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,146
Hey, Yeong-bae.
Those two are dating, right?

89
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,481
No.

90
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,818
What are you talking about?

91
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,863
That little girl is so lucky.

92
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,866
Hey, go and get changed now.

93
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,880
No, I didn't walk in the rain that much.

94
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:48,968
I just walked around here and there.

95
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,346
Okay, Mom.

96
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,071
I brought your clothes. Change into them.

97
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,326
What's wrong with my mom?
She didn't have to ask you.

98
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,827
I asked her first.

99
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,455
She was worried you might be
walking in the rain.

100
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,458
Is there somewhere you can change?

101
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,169
Oh, it's okay. I'm fine.

102
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,589
Go and change. What if you catch a cold?

103
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,722
Look.

104
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:40,019
It's dry, right? I don't have to change.

105
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,525
But the thing is, Hwi-yeong...

106
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,362
Don't do things like this.
It makes me a bit uncomfortable.

107
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,489
Why do you feel uncomfortable?

108
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,574
I brought it because I wanted to.

109
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,079
Well, we'll be late. Let's hurry.

110
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,873
Let's go, Hwi-yeong.
Don't forget your stuff.

111
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,462
CHOE JUN-U

112
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,282
I told you to send me the part after
this. Why haven't you sent it yet?

113
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:45,126
And translate what you wrote earlier

114
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,711
into English and send it to me.

115
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,088
I won't say anything even if
it's not good, so just send it.

116
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,464
It'll help you study.

117
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,924
"It'll help you study"?

118
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,305
Right, she's in the top tier in English.

119
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,772
All right. As you guys just saw,
we can prove that the sine rule

120
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,983
is always valid for acute, right,

121
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,736
and obtuse-angled triangles.

122
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:15,031
In summary, this is the formula
you guys will have to use.

123
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,992
The length of one side divided by
the sine value equals the diameter

124
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,036
of the circumscribed circle.

125
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,121
Okay, let's put it to use right away.

126
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,040
Who wants to solve this question?

127
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,377
Hwi-yeong, do you want to try?

128
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,719
-Sure.
-Were you distracted?

129
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:37,928
What's with you today?

130
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,264
Mr. Son, I guess he's having

131
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,600
a hard time concentrating
because his girlfriend

132
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,810
has graced us with her presence today.

133
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,854
Gosh, it's a big problem.

134
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,482
This is no good.

135
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,609
What should we do about this?

136
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,944
Mr. Son. Instead of him,

137
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,239
since I don't have a girlfriend,

138
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,367
I'll try solving it.

139
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,826
Okay, give it a shot.

140
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,246
Why do you think
that you don't have a girlfriend?

141
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,792
-Never mind. I'm sorry.
-Ro-mi, Soo-bin is at our academy.

142
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,335
Erase this first.

143
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,421
I'm back.

144
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,688
I'm home.

145
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,901
Yes.

146
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,904
Did you have a good day?

147
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:39,240
Was the class okay?

148
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,617
Yes, it was all right.

149
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,870
Mom, what happened?

150
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:45,955
Did you hurt your head?

151
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,457
I bumped my head
when I was running after you earlier.

152
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,546
I'm sorry.

153
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:57,258
It was quite upsetting for me to see you

154
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:01,178
being like that
in front of Hwi-yeong's mom.

155
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,305
Soo-bin.

156
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,766
I know...

157
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,270
that I pester you so much.

158
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,981
I also know that I shouldn't.

159
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:15,609
I always tell myself to let go
of my greed, but it's not easy.

160
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,654
You're my one and only daughter,

161
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,032
my baby whom I love the most
in the whole wide world.

162
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,703
"What if she graduates
from a mediocre university?

163
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,123
And what if people look down
on her because of that?

164
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,751
What if she can't get a nice husband?

165
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,504
What if she can't afford
to live in Gangnam?

166
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:39,633
What if she struggles?"
I can't stop worrying.

167
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:44,680
Mom.

168
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,433
Gosh, lie on your back.

169
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,394
This is why your shoulders
are always so tense.

170
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,483
I'll study hard.

171
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,693
Don't worry too much.

172
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,166
I didn't get hurt for nothing after all.

173
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,045
Gosh.

174
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,154
Sent you the English version.
Revise it for me please.

175
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,828
About the part at the end...
I'm still thinking.

176
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:57,878
My gosh.

177
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,590
Jun-u's English is seriously bad.

178
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,467
What do I do?

179
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,220
Oh, my goodness.

180
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,557
I can see that he tried his best.

181
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,569
It's relatively good.

182
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,028
I made a few changes.

183
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,489
This isn't "a few."

184
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,700
How embarrassing.

185
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,829
Memorize the whole thing.
We'll go over it together tomorrow.

186
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,539
You can't sleep until you memorize it.

187
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:47,678
That explains it.

188
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,055
That's why your uniform and clothes

189
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,683
always seemed all wrinkled up and dirty.

190
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,268
Since you don't have an iron?

191
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,073
TO REMOVE WRINKLES WITHOUT AN IRON

192
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,251
It was in my pocket.

193
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,421
Why is Mom calling so early?

194
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,994
-Hi, Mom.
-Good morning, Jun-u.

195
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,288
-Are you washing up?
-Yes, my eyes are burning. Hurry.

196
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,330
Okay, Jun-u.

197
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,999
Don't forget to eat breakfast.

198
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,917
-Breakfast, okay.
-Put on the uniform,

199
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,462
-and don't forget the handkerchief.
-The handkerchief? Got it.

200
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,630
Mom, I have to go. My eyes are burning.

201
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,175
All right. I love you, my baby.

202
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,885
-Okay, bye.
-Have a good day.

203
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,178
Okay.

204
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,865
Jeong-hu, are you all right?

205
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,960
Please leave a message after the tone.

206
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,309
Hi.

207
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:25,938
Jun-u?

208
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,899
Choe Jun-u. Come here.

209
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,401
Choe-- Hey.

210
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,086
I bet you weren't expecting this.

211
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,630
What's up with that mask?

212
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,177
You're such a great actor.

213
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,763
Are you in a boy band or what? Come here.

214
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,306
Stand still. Take that off.

215
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,101
What happened to your face?

216
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,354
-Mr. Oh!
-Hello.

217
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:08,981
Hello.

218
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,441
He caught a cold in this heat.

219
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,318
-Great.
-Okay.

220
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,653
Have a nice day.

221
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,993
Hey. What happened?
Did you get in a fight?

222
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,244
When? Where? With whom?

223
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,289
No. I fell off my bike.

224
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,207
You fell off your bike

225
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,002
and got these small wounds
on your eye, lip, and cheek?

226
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,670
You don't want to say, is that it?

227
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:37,134
Fine. Well, nothing was reported
to the school,

228
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,886
so it must not be anything big.

229
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,637
Are you sure you're okay?

230
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,390
Yes. I'm sorry.

231
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,185
Cover it up well and cough a lot.

232
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,604
Okay. Hi, Hwi-yeong, Gi-tae.

233
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,855
-Hello.
-Hello.

234
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,483
Why did you have to catch a cold?

235
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:10,250
They got scared when the cops showed up.

236
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,920
They'll do it right next time.

237
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,009
They won't do anything stupid, right?

238
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,555
I don't think they will. Don't worry.

239
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,015
What if they will?

240
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,147
Don't worry.

241
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,317
You have me.

242
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:43,992
SEARCH

243
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,954
BYEONGMUN HIGH SCHOOL

244
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:50,415
Are you having carrots for lunch again?

245
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,334
That's right.

246
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,086
You'll turn into a rabbit.

247
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,463
-O-je. When are we going to practice?
-Oh, hi.

248
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,006
Later.

249
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,925
Why? Can't we do it now?

250
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,051
Later.

251
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,058
Hi.

252
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,896
Hey. Hi.

253
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:16,483
That will draw more attention
from the teachers.

254
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:21,780
That must hurt.

255
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,490
Not at all.

256
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,287
Did you practice English a lot?

257
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:33,875
A little.

258
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,553
A little won't be enough.

259
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,484
I washed it. Thanks.

260
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,909
If you do that, it'll be wrinkled.

261
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,120
I ironed it nicely.

262
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,807
Good.

263
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:37,564
Well... You said you had no iron,
but you ironed it nicely.

264
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:49,993
Hey. So...

265
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,120
I worked on our test a little...

266
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,706
Pil-sang. Get lost.

267
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,667
Okay. I will.

268
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,055
What are you doing?

269
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,099
Darn it. Just go back to studying.

270
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,318
Jun-u. Your face...

271
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,279
-Are you okay?
-Are you all right?

272
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,367
Hey, Jun-u.

273
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,868
You must have gotten into a fight.

274
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,245
Who was it?

275
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,288
Our neighborhood has been quiet lately.

276
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,666
Right, Pil-sang? Pil-sang...

277
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,710
Hey. Jun-u must have been beaten up.

278
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:43,547
Right? That's why he's wearing
a mask, right?

279
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,174
-Yes.
-I'm not even surprised.

280
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,592
I don't think so.

281
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:50,178
I heard he fell off his bike.

282
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,304
No, no.

283
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,223
I doubt that.

284
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,017
Soo-bin.

285
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,186
Yes, Ro-mi?

286
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,105
I hear you're taking Mr. Son's classes.

287
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:02,649
-For real?
-Did you pass the level test?

288
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,151
I knew it.

289
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,528
I hear it's not easy
to get a chance to take the test.

290
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,488
How did you get to take it?

291
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,782
What happened was...

292
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,117
I recommended her.

293
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,286
I thought she was qualified.

294
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:17,080
Did you even take the level test?

295
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,834
I did. Ro-mi, let's talk--

296
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,253
Hwi-yeong, can we have a word?

297
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:28,592
Later. I need to do this now.

298
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,222
Later.

299
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,391
No, let's talk now.

300
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:40,270
Hey, Ro-mi. You little... That's so rude.

301
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,980
-Stop it.
-Do you want a beating?

302
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,440
Hey. Respond when someone talks to you.

303
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:44,816
-Ro-mi.
-Okay.

304
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,569
Let's get ready. Take your seats.

305
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:54,701
Why does the mood seem so dark?

306
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,539
Pil-sang? Why do you look the darkest?

307
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,458
It... It wasn't me.

308
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:15,597
Ro-mi.

309
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,517
Why didn't you tell us that day?

310
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,603
When you came from somewhere
when we were at the cafe,

311
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,647
you took the level test that day, right?

312
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,316
I felt awkward telling you then.

313
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:28,693
You felt awkward because you felt guilty?

314
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,656
In a way, yes.

315
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,282
Since Hwi-yeong recommended me.

316
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,493
And since I could've failed the test,

317
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,245
I didn't think I had to tell you.

318
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:41,414
But you passed anyway,
thanks to Hwi-yeong.

319
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,168
I did pass.

320
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,463
I think I passed
because I was good enough.

321
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:50,715
I went over the test questions
when I got home,

322
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,385
and I did pretty well on the test.

323
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:54,594
It's so annoying.

324
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:57,347
All this favor and preferential treatment.

325
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,557
-It's not like that.
-That's enough.

326
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,142
I don't want to talk to you.

327
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,270
Ro-mi.

328
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,405
Did you two fight?

329
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,449
Do you think I'm like you?

330
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,788
Yes, we fought.

331
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:24,708
Did you win?

332
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,546
That means you won.

333
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,590
Losing is winning.

334
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,557
That mask looks so bad on you.

335
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,024
Yes.

336
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:51,109
If possible,

337
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:53,737
I'd like to meet
Jun-u's previous homeroom teacher.

338
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:55,488
Yes.

339
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:57,490
Hello?

340
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,577
Please give me a call--

341
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:02,954
What's his problem?

342
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:06,875
Mr. Oh. A student asked me

343
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,668
to bring this to you.

344
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:10,920
-Thank you.
-Sure.

345
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,801
SHIN JEONG-HU FROM BYEONGMUN HIGH

346
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,471
"Shin Jeong-hu from Byeongmun High"?

347
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:24,476
Excuse me. Did you just get this?

348
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,480
Hey, Shin Jeong-hu!

349
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,190
Hey!

350
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:32,442
Jeong... Jeong-hu!

351
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:37,322
Okay. Today, we will learn about cities.

352
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,366
In our country, Seoul...

353
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,159
Gas.

354
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,913
Pil-sang, open the windows.

355
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,499
What was that?

356
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,919
Jeong-hu! Hold on.

357
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,295
-Hey, Shin Jeong-hu!
-Hey.

358
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,880
What is Mr. Oh doing out there?

359
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,757
-Why? What is it?
-Hey.

360
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,884
Hey. Shin Jeong-hu!

361
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,970
Hey! Shin Jeong-hu! Hold on. Wait.

362
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:02,806
-Hey. Shin Jeong-hu!
-Jeong-hu?

363
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:03,932
Hey!

364
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,393
Jun-u! Where are you going?
We're in the middle of class!

365
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:08,937
What will I do with him?

366
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:10,897
Teacher.

367
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,316
Jeong-hu! Oh, cramp...

368
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,657
Jun-u! Jun-u, Jeong-hu!

369
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,574
Jun-u!

370
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:25,912
Hey!

371
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,761
Thank you.

372
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,941
Can you lend me the bus fare?

373
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,195
Don't you have to go back?

374
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:01,281
I do.

375
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,324
I'm in trouble now.

376
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,836
You'll get expelled
if you're caught again.

377
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,004
How will you handle it?

378
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,505
But it's the first time for me.

379
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,132
Don't you even feel angry?

380
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,593
I just put the blame
for everything on you.

381
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,015
Jeong-hu.

382
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,728
Let's start over.

383
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,522
At another school. Okay?

384
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:42,947
I quit school.

385
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,412
I'm just going to work instead
for the time being.

386
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,296
Jun-u.

387
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,051
I'm sorry for everything.

388
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,473
You were falsely accused because of me

389
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,475
and even forced to transfer.

390
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:13,645
I'm sorry.

391
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,235
I'm okay.

392
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,321
I'm doing well here,
so that's enough for me.

393
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,116
-Jun-u.
-What?

394
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:33,289
Why?

395
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,875
Is your new school okay?

396
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,628
Yes, don't worry.

397
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,839
Watch out for bullies at your school.

398
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:42,757
You never know.

399
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,133
I'm not afraid at all.

400
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:49,180
You better call me
if someone else bullies you again.

401
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:50,849
Don't talk like my big brother.

402
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,820
I'll go to see you during summer break.

403
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:05,822
You'll let me sleep over, right?

404
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,282
Go back to school now.

405
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,119
Jeong-hu.

406
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:18,334
Our lives are not that messed up
after all.

407
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,548
No. Who cares if we were born
a bit miserably?

408
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,800
We can overcome it. Don't you think so?

409
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,931
-I'll see you again.
-Bye.

410
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:38,354
EXPRESS BUS
SEOUL TO UIJEONGBU

411
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,625
And if you look here,

412
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,627
their ownership of land was increased

413
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,212
to contribute to their wealth...

414
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,092
-Did you meet Jeong-hu?
-Yes.

415
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,553
Jeong-hu gave me a letter.

416
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:13,848
He said you were falsely accused
and forced to transfer because of him.

417
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,144
My goodness.

418
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,980
-What are you doing?
-Oh, yes, sir.

419
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,982
I was having a word with Jun-u.

420
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,860
He caught a cold without my permission.

421
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,241
Keep coughing.

422
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:37,830
The aristocrats consisted
mainly of high-ranking officials.

423
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,874
And their government positions were

424
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,251
inherited from one generation to the next.

425
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,588
They enjoyed their wealth
and lived extravagantly.

426
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,298
However, as time passed,

427
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:50,259
they began to place more importance
on the National State Exam,

428
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:53,304
and it started to change their lifestyles.

429
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:57,016
Shall I change my seat?

430
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,644
Thank you, Hwi-yeong.

431
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,563
See you at the academy later, Soo-bin.

432
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,568
-I'll call you later.
-Okay.

433
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,615
Ro-mi, aren't you going to practice?

434
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:13,741
No.

435
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,035
Ro-mi, I checked our script
one more time--

436
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:18,371
Just memorize what I gave you.

437
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:20,331
Ro-mi, watch your temper.

438
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,960
You look like a bride
about to get married.

439
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,337
Are you that happy to be
partners with O-je?

440
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,133
Look at her lips.

441
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,718
O-je, see you later.

442
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,053
Okay, see you.

443
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,201
Are you happy now?

444
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:00,538
Yes.

445
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,625
What did you talk about with Mr. Oh?

446
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,002
You almost skipped the class.

447
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,465
We didn't actually talk.

448
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,175
Was it another matchup?

449
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,010
No.

450
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:19,265
Let's just say he protected me in a way.

451
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,516
He covered for me.

452
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,352
What are you talking about?

453
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,439
Let's practice our English.

454
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,233
Why don't we do it over there?

455
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,115
What is that?

456
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:38,951
The sentences you wrote down for me.

457
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,162
Okay.

458
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:42,580
Read them out loud.

459
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:45,666
I'm embarrassed.

460
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,724
Hang on. "So me"?

461
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:05,812
It's "Some." Look carefully. S, O, M, E.

462
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,522
Oh, right.

463
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,191
I know this word.

464
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,692
You know, but what?

465
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,696
I'm a bit nervous.

466
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,075
Okay. Read it again.

467
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:40,930
Look at this word, "slept with."
You need to remember this.

468
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,432
"Slept with." Don't pronounce it as
"sleep with."

469
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,352
Just memorize these together.

470
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:49,438
Don't forget to add "with" at the end
for the correct meaning.

471
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:53,276
I knew that, you know.

472
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,405
Is that so? What was "So me" then?

473
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,656
"So me people"?

474
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,035
The weather is great.

475
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:10,251
But is this really your dream?

476
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,547
Then what is your dream?

477
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:22,930
Let's read it again.

478
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,016
Since your part is more important
right now.

479
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,934
All right, let me begin.

480
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,361
You even added a touch of emotion.

481
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,824
It seems like we're making some progress.

482
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,159
I see a glimpse of hope.

483
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,372
-To the academy?
-Yes.

484
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:50,708
Bye.

485
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,879
You have to practice that
really hard today.

486
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:57,548
-Especially the spots I marked.
-Okay.

487
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,300
You should go now.

488
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:06,766
Wait.

489
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,319
Look. Every time you finish reading this,

490
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,279
color in one grape, okay?

491
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,408
Grape?

492
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,121
One, two, three, four...

493
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:33,292
Fifty times?

494
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,254
You know 50 times isn't enough, right?

495
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,842
Do you want ten more?

496
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,012
This is enough.

497
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,558
-You should get going.
-Okay.

498
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,145
Study hard! Stay up all night!

499
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,074
Hi, Mom. What's up?

500
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:06,701
Soo-bin, is it true?

501
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,869
-What?
-Did you partner up with the guy

502
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,621
who was forced to transfer recently?

503
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:13,165
What is wrong with Mr. Oh?

504
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:15,251
Does he think
that the test is a joke or what?

505
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,336
How could he partner you up
with a guy like that?

506
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,714
It wasn't Mr. Oh.

507
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,132
We did a random draw.

508
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:22,341
A random draw?

509
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:25,594
It was my idea, Mom.

510
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,805
It's a test. How could your partner
be decided like that?

511
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,391
Hey. Soo-bin?

512
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,688
Hello.

513
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,441
Jun-u.

514
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,735
Jun-u.

515
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,111
Jun-u.

516
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:46,198
Jun-u...

517
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,789
I knew it.

518
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:56,667
I bet you were pretending to be
washing your hair to cover this.

519
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:57,877
Let me see.

520
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,046
Gosh, my goodness.

521
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,299
Mom.

522
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,426
How did you know?

523
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:09,472
Hey, Yeong-bae. Don't you know
that all moms know everything?

524
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:12,058
They have crazy instincts.
They can practically read your mind.

525
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,352
Gosh, you shouldn't have lied to your mom.

526
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:18,147
What are you going to do now?

527
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,816
Gosh, this is so upsetting.

528
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,405
It's okay. It wasn't a big deal.

529
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:30,284
You're sure, right?
Nothing serious is going on?

530
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:32,536
Yes, I'm sure. It's all been sorted out.

531
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,958
I went through hoops
to get you out of that situation.

532
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,006
Trust me, Mom.

533
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,386
You said I'm the only person
you can trust in the whole world.

534
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:55,559
Nothing bad will happen. Trust me, okay?

535
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:56,977
Okay.

536
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:59,688
You should go.
You'll be late for work again.

537
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:08,280
I dropped off side dishes at your house.
Make sure you never skip breakfast, okay?

538
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,824
Okay, I'll catch a cab for you.

539
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,534
I'll just take the bus.

540
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:14,495
Listen. Don't ever fight with anyone.

541
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,747
And do not let anyone hit you, okay?

542
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,457
Promise me, okay?

543
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,626
Okay, don't worry.

544
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,923
I'll be off, then.

545
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,723
There's soup in the freezer.
Heat it up in the microwave.

546
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,475
Okay. Gosh, be careful.

547
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,603
-Bye.
-Okay, bye.

548
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,731
-Be careful!
-All right.

549
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:52,950
Soo-bin.

550
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,453
-Let's go together.
-Sure.

551
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:00,666
Is something bothering you?

552
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:06,672
Hwi-yeong, I want to quit
Mr. Son's math class.

553
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:13,053
Don't take what Ro-mi said to heart.

554
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:16,515
Well, it's not that.

555
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,934
I just don't like feeling this way.

556
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,269
What's the matter, though?

557
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:22,855
I recommended you to Mr. Son
because you're my friend,

558
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:24,940
and you got in
because you did well on the test.

559
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,901
And Hwi-yeong...

560
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:28,861
Well...

561
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,032
It's okay. Go on.

562
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,579
I'd appreciate it if you could stop

563
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:42,833
talking to your friends
that I'm your girlfriend.

564
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:46,378
I know that you're doing it
to help me out,

565
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:49,715
but it makes me uncomfortable.

566
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,304
Soo-bin.

567
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,014
Yes?

568
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:01,477
Why do you always
feel uncomfortable around me?

569
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:03,979
You said I made you uncomfortable

570
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:06,232
when I brought you clothes
when you got soaked in the rain.

571
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,859
And you don't like to be my girlfriend.

572
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:14,031
You're always uncomfortable around me.

573
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:16,617
Hwi-yeong.

574
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,745
You were never like this before.

575
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:24,041
We were good, close friends.

576
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,467
Hwi-yeong, that kid...

577
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,136
I feel so guilty now.

578
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,649
MA HWI-YEONG

579
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:13,132
I know that you're doing it
to help me out,

580
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,843
but it makes me uncomfortable.

581
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,136
You know...

582
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,805
that's not why I do it.

583
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,700
Why are you so late?

584
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,785
Didn't your class end hours ago?

585
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:43,912
I went to do some exercise.

586
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:45,706
Son.

587
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,542
I hope you're not distracted
from your studies

588
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,753
because of Soo-bin.

589
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,005
Mom, please.

590
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,383
I'm going upstairs.

591
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,262
I trust you, son.

592
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:05,851
This is pretty good.

593
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:08,771
Now, I understand
why they say Mr. Son is really good.

594
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,607
-Seriously?
-Yes.

595
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,859
I'll check my level test
and quit the class

596
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:16,153
if I didn't get in with my score alone.

597
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:17,863
Can I take the test for the class

598
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:19,740
if you quit?

599
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,408
Yes, of course.

600
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,620
But let's not get awkward
because of something like this.

601
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,746
We're friends, you know.

602
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,416
Mom, about Mr. Son's math...

603
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,919
What is it? What did Mr. Son say?

604
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,587
Can I just...

605
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:37,758
It's nothing. Never mind.

606
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:43,555
Also, about the free-talking test...
I hope you won't say anything about it.

607
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,766
Yes, I'm going to keep quiet about it.

608
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:48,602
What if I complain
and get on the wrong side of the teachers?

609
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,897
But don't be friends with that kid, okay?

610
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:53,732
I'm sure you won't anyway.

611
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,484
You have to be careful of kids like him.

612
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,531
What about this part, though?

613
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:03,200
"However, I still sleep
with the lights on.

614
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:05,244
Not because I'm afraid of ghosts..."

615
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,912
Then what? What's after this?

616
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:09,289
You need to tell me the rest
to complete this script.

617
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,000
That part...

618
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:16,255
Because you don't want it to be dark
when your parents get home.

619
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:17,256
Right?

620
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:20,259
Then why?

621
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,555
"It's not because I'm afraid of ghosts.

622
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,182
It's because I'm terrified of zombies."

623
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,476
-Gosh, zombies...
-What?

624
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,894
That's basically the same thing.

625
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:32,938
I was just kidding.

626
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:38,152
It's just a habit of mine.

627
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:41,780
I guess it's become a habit.

628
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:44,158
I can't really fall asleep
with the lights off.

629
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,204
Choe Jun-u...

630
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:59,590
You should practice sleeping
with the lights off starting today.

631
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:01,049
I mean, you're not a baby.

632
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,343
Be honest with me.
You're just scared, aren't you?

633
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:06,138
You're afraid ghosts will show up
when you turn the lights off.

634
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:07,222
No, I'm not.

635
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,766
Come on. I think you are.

636
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,560
Just sleep with the lights off
starting today.

637
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:13,270
Your electricity bill must be very high

638
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,063
if you always keep the lights on
all night.

639
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:17,232
Don't be so wasteful, okay?

640
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:29,161
So he's been sleeping like this
since he was a kid.

641
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,334
It must've been so uncomfortable.

642
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:57,814
It's not because I'm afraid of ghosts.

643
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,237
It's because keeping the lights on...

644
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:06,406
helps me feel less lonely.

645
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:30,681
Hey.

646
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,184
-What is that?
-Isn't he cute?

647
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:36,812
His name's Rice.

648
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:38,897
What kind of name is Rice?

649
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:40,774
It's cute.

650
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,860
You're so cute.

651
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:11,305
My phone was blowing up
with texts all night long.

652
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:15,267
Some parents are
still complaining fiercely.

653
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,313
Scrap the English free-talking test.

654
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:21,607
Sorry?

655
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,484
But... I can't do that.

656
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,737
We can't cancel a test
just because the parents complain.

657
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,196
As a teacher, that's so...

658
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,574
We have our pride.

659
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:35,078
Mr. Oh. Are you refusing to do as I say?

660
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:36,705
No, sir.

661
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,957
Right? Okay.

662
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:41,793
Yes, sir.

663
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:52,429
Okay. I'm going to the Education Office.

664
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:58,352
Mr. Oh. Are you okay? Mr. Oh.

665
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,062
Did he leave?

666
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,065
Yes. He has a meeting
at the Education Office.

667
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,821
So? What will you do?

668
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,242
What else? Just do what you want.

669
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:24,503
Okay.

670
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,256
Okay.

671
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,138
This is the moment everyone becomes happy.

672
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,140
The English free-talking test...

673
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:38,934
will now begin!

674
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:47,275
Okay. I've prepared this myself.

675
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,778
-The long-awaited first couple...
-Did you memorize everything?

676
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:54,825
Drum roll...

677
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,330
Kwon Da-huin and Jung O-je!

678
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:04,167
Come out here.

679
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:51,506
No touching. I'm docking points.
I'm docking points, O-je.

680
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:54,843
Okay, let's give them a round of applause!

681
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:58,305
Was Da-huin that good in English?

682
00:50:58,597 --> 00:50:59,890
It's the power of love.

683
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:08,398
Mr. Oh. I have another dream.

684
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,567
-What?
-Da-huin, we're done.

685
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,279
My other dream...

686
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:24,623
What was that?

687
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,669
-You should date!
-You should date!

688
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,963
-Hey, hey, hey.
-You should date!

689
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,632
-You should date!
-You should date!

690
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:34,925
-You should date!
-Yes.

691
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:36,301
-You should date!
-You should date!

692
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:41,097
Hey, guys. Quiet down. Quiet.

693
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,141
Nice.

694
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,730
What's this?
You listened to me right away.

695
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:50,607
It's not like I'm Hwi-yeong.

696
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,442
Mr. Oh.

697
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,530
Oh, my god.

698
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,745
Mr. Oh. May we speak?

699
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:06,706
I'm in the middle of the class.

700
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,292
Study on your own for a bit.

701
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:12,212
-Hwi-yeong, take care of the class.
-Yes, sir.

702
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:13,463
Mr. Oh.

703
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,425
Okay. Study on your own.

704
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:18,552
Okay.

705
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:22,681
-What was that?
-Quiet.

706
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,308
Mr. Oh. Didn't you hear me before?

707
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:29,062
Well, the kids worked hard
to prepare for it,

708
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:32,440
-and as I said earlier--
-Come to my office.

709
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:35,944
Yes, sir.

710
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:44,995
Da-huin hit the lottery.

711
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:48,582
-You got the most out of this.
-Right?

712
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:51,126
I'm so happy right now.

713
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,795
I think Mr. Oh is in a bad mood.

714
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:55,755
Hwi-yeong will be
wrapping up today's class.

715
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,925
Who keeps pressuring the vice-principal?

716
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,427
It isn't my mom.

717
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:04,222
I have an idea who's behind this.

718
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,601
-Me?
-What?

719
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,853
I never said it was you.

720
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:12,188
-Is it the guilty conscience?
-Why you--

721
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,815
-Hey, hold on.
-What?

722
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,233
Are you going to hit me with that?

723
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:19,946
-Hit me.
-Come on. Stop it!

724
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,032
-Stop it.
-Hold back!

725
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:24,326
-Hey! Stop it!
-You little...

726
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:26,036
I'm upset too!

727
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:29,289
You didn't even do the test.
Why are you upset?

728
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:31,249
Because you couldn't be partners
with Jun-u?

729
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:36,171
That's right! Do you know
how hard I worked

730
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:37,672
to teach that fool?

731
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,091
-It was useless.
-Exactly.

732
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:42,260
Isn't it better
that you didn't do the test then?

733
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,764
Whatever! Regardless, you guys

734
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,557
don't fight. Seriously.

735
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,017
You're so noisy!

736
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:54,105
-What's her problem?
-She said not to fight.

737
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:00,320
What is this? Why am I disappointed?

738
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:03,865
It's because I wasted all that time.

739
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:07,827
Regardless, you're no longer
teaching Class Three.

740
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:11,122
It's what all of the parents,
the homeroom teacher,

741
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:12,624
and I want.

742
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:32,644
I'm sorry.

743
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:37,440
That rolled here all by itself.

744
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:39,109
You're right.

745
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:43,029
Why? Is something wrong?
It's the kids from your old school, right?

746
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:45,657
-Those jerks. Lead the way.
-No, I...

747
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:49,327
had a question.

748
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:51,079
What?

749
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:00,255
What?

750
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:05,260
What's wrong with you?

751
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:07,178
I just wanted to know what your dream is.

752
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:09,556
I guess it's a secret.

753
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:20,734
I don't understand English very well.

754
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:23,361
Right? My dream is...

755
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:27,782
unboxing limited editions all day long...

756
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,743
No, no. Not being cheap

757
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:32,328
and waiting for off-season sales,

758
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,748
I want to make big purchases
without hesitation?

759
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:38,543
I'm a shopaholic.

760
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,589
I doubt that's it.

761
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:43,840
No, right?

762
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,800
What was my dream again?

763
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,179
I'm not sure, actually.

764
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,141
Why?

765
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,187
You're a lot like me.

766
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,022
You've lost your dream.

767
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:01,608
What? I am not. I...

768
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:05,612
I drink a lot because of you kids,
so my memory

769
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,155
got slightly bad, that's all.

770
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:10,366
-That's not true.
-You talk a lot now.

771
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:11,910
Mr. Oh!

772
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:15,246
What is this? We worked so hard
for the English test.

773
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,542
Soo-bin. Sorry. I...

774
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,961
-We want to do it here.
-What?

775
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:25,423
It was super hard training him.

776
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:26,591
It's unfair.

777
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:27,842
Did you say you trained him?

778
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,304
Hold on. Then...

779
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:35,558
Okay. This teacher of yours will grant you

780
00:56:36,017 --> 00:56:39,395
a special test.

781
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:50,740
He forgot. I should dock some points...

782
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:53,243
No, wait. Time out.

783
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:55,870
-You can do it.
-Okay, I'll try again.

784
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:00,583
Soo-bin is...

785
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:02,877
smiling.

786
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:33,343
Yes!

787
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:36,930
Jun-u, no, I mean you did a great job.

788
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:38,932
-Soo-bin, great job.
-Thank you.

789
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,808
All right, then.

790
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:43,019
Although it's unofficial,

791
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:44,938
both of you receive

792
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:47,315
100 points!

793
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:49,859
100 points!

794
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:52,987
To congratulate your perfect score,

795
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:54,614
why don't we go get some pizza?

796
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:56,824
-Deal.
-Deal! Great.

797
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:57,951
Let's go.

798
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,745
I have to go to work.

799
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:03,498
Come on. I know you have some time left.

800
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:09,754
-Deal.
-Deal. Come on, let's go.

801
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:13,132
You did such a great job.

802
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:20,598
Hello?

803
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:22,976
Yes.

804
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:26,229
Sorry?

805
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:30,191
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

806
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:58,052
I thought you might be scared.

807
00:59:58,136 --> 00:59:59,846
Hey, Jeong-hu.

808
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:06,811
Jun-u. I'm sorry for everything.

809
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:11,065
Jeong-hu. Our lives are not
that messed up after all.

810
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:14,402
No. Who cares if we were born
a bit miserably?

811
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:16,654
We can overcome it. Don't you think so?

812
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,466
FUNERAL HALL, MORTUARY

813
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:40,595
LATE SHIN JEONG-HU

814
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,066
Jun-u.

815
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,153
I brought your classmates.

816
01:00:58,905 --> 01:00:59,781
Are you okay?

817
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,913
Why don't we wait outside? Let's go.

818
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:23,054
I guess he has no family.

819
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:25,973
He has a father,
but we can't reach him yet.

820
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:27,809
His grandmother is at a nursing home

821
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:29,143
due to Alzheimer's.

822
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,607
Jun-u probably hasn't had anything to eat.

823
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:40,571
Shall we go get something to eat?

824
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:42,990
-Shall we?
-I'll go.

825
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:49,997
Get it over with and come back out.

826
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:53,209
I think they're the assailants.

827
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:57,213
What is going on?

828
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:50,016
Let's go.

829
01:02:58,065 --> 01:02:59,442
I guess that bastard didn't come.

830
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:03,321
Do you know Lee Gi-tae? In your class.

831
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:08,075
He paid us money to get you expelled.

832
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:14,624
I was going to quit after just one time.

833
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:16,876
Geon-hyeok, let's go.

834
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,107
Because you were out of line.

835
01:03:41,734 --> 01:03:45,404
You started to raise doubts about me
instead of getting lost quietly.

836
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:46,781
How dare you do that...

837
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,076
to me.

838
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:37,039
Jun-u, stop!

839
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:16,704
Did you give them money? Are you crazy?

840
01:05:16,787 --> 01:05:18,289
Do you think he'll have your back?

841
01:05:18,372 --> 01:05:20,207
My friend died because of you guys.

842
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:21,709
I'll get on my knees.

843
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:23,878
Your life is already ruined,
but mine is different.

844
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:26,297
Why didn't you hit him back
when Jun-u was hitting you?

845
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:27,965
Were you upset that I beat up Hwi-yeong?

846
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:29,884
I wanted to help
in case you were treated unfairly.

847
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:31,052
Why would you help me?

848
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,219
Out of pity?

849
01:05:32,845 --> 01:05:35,348
You can say exactly what you saw, right?

850
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:36,474
Thank you, Geon-hyeok.

851
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:38,142
Mom, help me.

852
01:05:38,225 --> 01:05:40,227
-Are you embarrassed?
-Did you give birth to me

853
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:41,687
just to brag to others?

854
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:43,064
I won't make it to SNU.

855
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:45,358
-Are you okay?
-And why do I want to help you?

856
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:46,943
Is it out of pity?

857
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:56,118
