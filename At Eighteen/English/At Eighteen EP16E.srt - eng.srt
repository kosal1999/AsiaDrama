00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,634
Jun-u,

2
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,512
Hwi-yeong is leaving today.

3
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,474
He wanted to leave
when no one else was around.

4
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:03,772
Mr. Oh.

5
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,691
Thank you for everything.

6
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,571
And...

7
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,659
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,206
I was rude

9
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,334
and disrespectful to you.

10
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,380
Even my parents were so rude to you.

11
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,218
And I only cared about myself,
being the selfish guy I am.

12
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,932
I apologize for everything.

13
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:41,434
For what I did

14
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,438
to Jun-u as well.

15
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,655
Hwi-yeong.

16
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,075
You got through the worst part.

17
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,705
You'll probably have to go through
more ordeals,

18
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,500
but don't resent anyone.

19
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,337
Just stay strong and live your life

20
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,132
of your own accord.

21
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:14,926
I will.

22
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,724
Gosh. I have to say,

23
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,561
I'm sad that you're leaving.

24
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,315
Take good care of yourself,

25
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,776
and stay in touch.

26
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,572
Yes, I will.

27
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,650
Soo-bin.

28
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,158
You'll be fine, right?

29
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,786
Take care.

30
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,250
Bye.

31
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,685
You said I'm dropping out
because I want to run away.

32
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,856
So I thought long and hard about it,

33
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,197
but I think this is
the only thing I can do for now.

34
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,117
Going to school

35
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:07,288
with students who have been studying
so hard and honestly...

36
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,417
makes me feel too guilty.

37
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,802
I'll pay

38
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,429
for all the bad things that I did to you

39
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,431
and repent for the rest of my life.

40
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,559
Jun-u.

41
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,565
Thanks for forgiving me.

42
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,199
Goodbye.

43
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,928
Do you want to ride my bike with me?

44
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,390
Sure.

45
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,984
Choe Jun-u! I'm sorry.

46
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,755
Soo-bin, I feel happy.

47
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,065

Soo-bin.

51
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,228
Why did you come here?
I can do this alone.

52
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:20,189
No, I...

53
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,275
I wanted to get here early,

54
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:26,195
but I have to go to the academy later.

55
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,449
Okay, that's fine.

56
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,367
-You're sweating.
-Gosh, don't.

57
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,328
I'm all sweaty.
Today is an important day, you know.

58
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:39,375
Gosh, you can't even run that well.

59
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,085
Thank goodness you didn't fall.

60
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,004
Jun-u, today...

61
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,048
Today...

62
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,718
I'll do a good job. Don't worry.

63
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,344
You'll do great.

64
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,055
Best of luck.

65
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,557
Thanks.

66
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,895
-I should head in, Soo-bin.
-Okay.

67
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,688
-Break a leg.
-Get back safely.

68
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,440
Okay, you'll do great.

69
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,691
Thanks.

70
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,156
Go on in.

You got this, Jun-u.

81
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:14,845
Soo-bin.

82
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,480
What's wrong?

83
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:28,067
I have to retake the course.

84
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,236
Again?

85
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,113
What do you mean?

86
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,616
Why? What happened?

87
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,494
I'm not the only one
that has to retake it.

88
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,414
-Everyone has to do it?
-Of course.

89
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,250
Gosh, I studied so hard.
Why do I have to retake it?

90
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,797
Just forget about it.
Why don't we go have lunch?

91
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,549
Okay.

92
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,343
I heard the food at the cafeteria here
is very good.

93
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,679
Let's eat off campus.

94
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:58,848
Shall we?

95
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,267
That will be better, right?

96
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,727
-Yes.
-All right, then.

How have you been, brother?

99
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,526
Mom and Dad couldn't come
because they're a little busy.

100
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,655
They're doing well.

101
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,827
Also, I dropped out of school.

102
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,498
I need some time to think...

103
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,087
about how I should live.

104
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,765
I LOVE YOU, SON

105
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,649
You know what?

106
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,571
You've always been my idol
since I was a kid.

107
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,080
You were smart,
and you were a straight-A student.

108
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:51,001
You were even good at sports
and good-looking.

109
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,841
You were Mom and Dad's favorite.

110
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,554
They couldn't be prouder of you.

111
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,768
They always told me
to try to be as good as you.

112
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,730
Just as good as you.

113
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,824
But I'll stop trying to be as good as you.

114
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,827
I'll be as good as I can be.

115
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,582
Just as good as I can be.

116
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,920
I'll find what I should do...

117
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,632
on my own.

118
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,722
Someone taught me that.

119
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,300
I wonder how Jun-u is doing.

120
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,474
Soo-bin.

121
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,768
-Mom.
-Get in.

122
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,356
We haven't been
on a date like this in ages.

123
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,151
I'm sorry. I've been too busy.

124
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,654
Don't apologize.
I think what you do is cool.

125
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,282
Soo-bin.

126
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,660
I've given it some thought.

127
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:51,956
From now on,

128
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:56,794
I'll try to trust you more.

129
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,422
But right now, I can't be

130
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,217
entirely happy about you two going out.

131
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,302
I know.

132
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,805
But I'm sorry

133
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,307
I reacted so emotionally.

134
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,353
Mom.

135
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,941
Can I ask you a favor?

136
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,526
What is it?

137
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:25,239
I want you to stop

138
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,284
caring about Dad,

139
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,245
be strong, and live your own life.

140
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:36,083
You've been doing your best so far.

141
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:40,045
Don't care about what other people think.

142
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,383
If you're worried about me,
I'm really okay.

143
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,847
I want you to continue to be

144
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,893
the confident, cool woman you are.

145
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,395
Not just Yoo Soo-bin's mom

146
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,814
or Yoo Jong-su's wife.

147
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,776
The fabulous career woman, Yoon Song-hui.

148
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,278
Like you've always been.

149
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:10,784
Okay?

150
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:12,912
Soo-bin.

151
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,373
Do you think we can eat
more food after this?

152
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,709
-More after this?
-This is...

153
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,146
-Hi, Mom.
-Jun-u, did it go well?

154
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,565
I did my best, but I'm not sure.

155
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,275
The other kids were so good.

156
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,070
I'm sure you did better
than everyone else.

157
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,697
Good job, son.

158
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,241
Where are you, by the way?
There's an echo.

159
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:56,121
I'm at a big supermarket.

160
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,499
We ran out of ingredients.

161
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,458
I see.

162
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,335
Mom.

163
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:03,837
Should I come today?

164
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:04,922
What?

165
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,842
Why are you so surprised?

166
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,387
Go home and rest.

167
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,430
Why would you come here?

168
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,099
All right.

169
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,393
Don't skip meals.

170
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,811
Okay. You too.

171
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:20,688
Bye.

172
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,858
Isn't Aunt Hye-yeong there?

173
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,403
She's not feeling so well these days.

174
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,114
You don't seem very well either.
Are you sick?

175
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:33,492
No. I'm in perfect health.

176
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,961
I'm sure he did well.

177
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,112
Soo-bin.

178
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,784
I'm with Mom. Can we text instead?

179
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,081
Soo-bin, everything went well.

180
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,209
Good job. Are you going home?

181
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,420
No. I'm on my way to my mom's.

182
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:27,796
I'm going to surprise her.

183
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:31,425
She'll be so happy. Have a safe trip.

184
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,386
I went on a date with my mom.

185
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:48,358
JEOKSEONG SNACK RESTAURANT

186
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,004
Mom.

187
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,590
Are you home?

188
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:57,761
We just closed the restaurant
and are finishing up.

189
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,265
How was it at the restaurant today?

190
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,308
Was it okay?

191
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,270
Yes, of course.

192
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,649
All right.

193
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,376
AUNT HYE-YEONG

194
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:33,589
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message.

195
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,008
You'll be charged after the beep.

196
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,767
AUNT SEON-MI

197
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,686
Aunt Seon-mi.

198
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,397
It's me, Jun-u.

199
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,819
Have you been well?

200
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,197
I'm wondering...

201
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,827
if something happened
to my mom's restaurant.

202
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,461
Please tell me.

203
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,306
I see.

204
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,041
Jun-u, are you asleep?

205
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,960
Did you visit your mom?

206
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,798
Yes, I did.

207
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,634
Can I call you?

208
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,287
Hey.

209
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:32,457
Jun-u, was your mom happy to see you?
Was she surprised?

210
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,418
Yes.

211
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:43,635
But you sound a bit worried
about something.

212
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,096
No, I'm not.

213
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,892
Don't lie. I already knew something was
on your mind when I saw your text.

214
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,477
What is it?

215
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:55,981
It's nothing.

216
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,318
I guess I was too nervous today.

217
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,404
Yes, I know.

218
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:05,073
It must've been a long day for you.

219
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,577
Yes, I'm a bit tired.

220
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,704
Then,

221
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:14,207
I'll sing you a lullaby
so you can sleep well.

222
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,502
Okay.

223
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,869
Ms. Lee! Hurry up and get in.

224
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:53,413
-I'm sorry I'm late.
-Why are you so late?

225
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,457
I'm sorry. Hello.

226
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,935
-Don't be late tomorrow.
-Okay.

227
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,228
Good night.

228
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,608
I'm so sleepy.

229
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,155
JEOKSEONG SNACK RESTAURANT

230
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,200
Hey, Jun-u.

231
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,202
Mom, what are you doing?

232
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:16,705
What do you think?

233
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,958
There are so many customers
right now. I'm really busy.

234
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,334
No, you're not.

235
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,129
Mom.

236
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,506
Tell me the truth.

237
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,593
What kind of situation we're in.

238
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,178
How difficult it is.

239
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,642
Don't worry. I'll take care of everything.

240
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,019
How can you call this taking care of...

241
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:26,608
Mom. I'm not a kid anymore.

242
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,818
If there's a problem,
you should discuss it with me.

243
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,862
It's just you and me in our family.

244
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,115
I'm your guardian too.

245
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,702
Why are you trying to carry
the weight of the world alone?

246
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,416
I feel so guilty and stupid for

247
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,293
not being aware of this all this time.

248
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,797
Jun-u, don't think that way.

249
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,885
I hid it from you

250
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,930
because there was
a good reason I couldn't tell you.

251
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,765
You did nothing wrong.

252
00:25:58,890 --> 00:25:59,975
Mom.

253
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,479
Tell me everything.

254
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,148
I want to know.

255
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:16,116
To tell you the truth, Aunt Hye-yeong

256
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:19,327
took the money we needed
for remodeling this place,

257
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,037
but I can't reach her.

258
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,791
It's quite a large amount

259
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,543
that took me a lot of time to save up.

260
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,675
I thought it would be better for me

261
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,427
to work part-time for now,

262
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,971
instead of running this restaurant
without remodeling.

263
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:44,728
I'm going to take care of everything.
Don't worry, Jun-u.

264
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,188
I'm going to reopen this place as well.

265
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,650
So you just concentrate on

266
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,987
preparing for art school.
Do you understand me?

267
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:55,822
Mom.

268
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,034
I'm sorry.

269
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,516
Monthly expenses.

270
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:31,191
Electric bill, food expenses,

271
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:34,861
transportation expenses,
and my academy fee.

272
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,697
The total is...

273
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,449
73,000 WON

274
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,476
Jun-u, what are you doing?

275
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:08,019
I'm at the academy.

276
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,313
Are you learning well?

277
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,024
Yes, I am.

278
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,160
Have a good day.

279
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,361
Shall we run away?

280
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,826
I was too busy to call you yesterday.

281
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,414
Jun-u.

282
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:13,501
Do you remember the day we got
soaked in the rain right here?

283
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:16,713
Yes.

284
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,383
By the way, why did you do that?

285
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:23,553
Did you think you'd be able
to block all the rain like that?

286
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,306
I don't know.

287
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,227
What I felt that day

288
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:34,856
was something I had never felt before.

289
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:36,566
What did you feel?

290
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,571
I felt as if

291
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,532
the rain we were soaked in

292
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:48,995
was washing away all the hurtful
feelings I had inside my heart.

293
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,251
Jun-u, what do you plan to do
during the summer break?

294
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,256
I'm not sure.

295
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:08,014
The summer vacation is finally...

296
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:10,725
-It's back!
-It's back!

297
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:17,398
No one looked excited when we were
talking about the school trip.

298
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,234
Are you that excited
about not having to see me?

299
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,027
-Yes.
-Pil-sang.

300
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,571
I was joking, of course. I'm actually sad.

301
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,032
Mr. Oh, how am I going to
get through the summer without you?

302
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,659
Pil-sang, stop putting on such a show.

303
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:30,286
Don't forget to check your homework
for each subject.

304
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:34,165
I hope you all stay productive
and healthy during the break.

305
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:37,794
And don't call me too often
even if you guys miss me.

306
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:39,963
Mr. Oh, can I follow you on social media?

307
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,422
Me too! Please follow me back.

308
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,174
I'm already following you guys.

309
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,803
-I see.
-I see.

310
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,429
Oh Han-gyeol.

311
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:51,891
You just got through your first semester
as a homeroom teacher.

312
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:53,893
Well done.

313
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,239
All right, guys.

314
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,950
Let's wrap up. Enjoy your summer break.

315
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,660
Off I go!

316
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:13,997
-Bye, Mr. Oh!
-Bye!

317
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,999
What's with Mr. Oh today?
He's being so corny.

318
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,918
Guys, how about we party it up today
to celebrate?

319
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,504
-Good call!
-When will you keep your promise?

320
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:22,964
I have to ask my mom first.

321
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,382
You can join us if you want.

322
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:27,051
Okay, I will.
I should join you girls, of course.

323
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,344
O-je and Jun-u.

324
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,096
Hang out with us. Go, let's go!

325
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,347
Pack up.

326
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,099
-Pack up your stuff.
-Pack up.

327
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,642
What should we do?

328
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,187
You look so excited.

329
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,569
Mr. Oh!

330
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:48,281
Ji-min, this is...
We're on school grounds now.

331
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,992
Please calm down.

332
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,329
I...

333
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,247
Gosh, it's okay.

334
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,041
There's always a next time, you know?

335
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,501
Do you want to go shopping today?

336
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,003
Or shall we go have some meat?

337
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,798
I passed, Mr. Oh.

338
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,717
I passed!

339
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,886
Seriously? Ji-min!

340
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,098
Wait, hold on. Ji-min.

341
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:17,101
Let's get out of here first. Come on.

342
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:20,229
Wow, Gi-tae.
Look at you volunteering at school.

343
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,690
Oh, just a second.

344
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,068
Throw out your own garbage, will you?

345
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,903
But this is right here. Sorry.

346
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,906
By the way, did you see Hwi-yeong leave?

347
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,449
No, I didn't.

348
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:35,620
He'll probably get in touch with me
after he pulls himself together.

349
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,833
Gosh, make sure to pick up
all the garbage, okay?

350
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,585
Go away, Sang-hun.

351
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:47,757
Take it easy.

352
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,850
-My gosh.
-What just happened?

353
00:32:58,643 --> 00:32:59,769
You're good.

354
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,896
Pil-sang, you're pretty good at bowling.

355
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,065
Of course. I'm good at everything else
but studying.

356
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,650
And I'm very good to you.

357
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,819
Cut it out. All right, Pil-sang.

358
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,904
Let's go to the movies this Saturday.

359
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,239
-Seriously?
-But

360
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,366
all of you have to come with us.

361
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:14,534
Otherwise, I won't go.

362
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:17,328
Guys, help me out just this one time.

363
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,663
I'll buy all the movie tickets.

364
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:19,747
Hey!

365
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,125
Pil-sang, do you think
we're broke or what?

366
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,085
Thanks!

367
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:26,796
Guys, let's go!

368
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,715
-Let's go.
-Just one more.

369
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:29,966
Go, Soo-bin!

370
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,015
That was so close.

371
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,975
Gosh, too bad.

372
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:40,059
I know.

373
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,271
Gosh, this feels like a dream.

374
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,231
I can't believe Ji-min finally passed.

375
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,404
She said she was going
to the ladies' room.

376
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:52,947
What's taking her so long?

377
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,657
Ta-da!

378
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,910
What's all this, Ji-min?

379
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,040
Mr. Oh, thank you for waiting for me.

380
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:06,544
And thank you
for always being there for me.

381
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,548
I'm going to formally ask you out today.

382
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,259
Please be my boyfriend.

383
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,265
Okay.

384
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:26,230
Jun-u, is something bothering you?

385
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:29,734
O-je.

386
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:31,778
-Yes.
-To tell you the truth,

387
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,490
I'm thinking about
going to live with my mom.

388
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,533
Did something happen to her?

389
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,413
I think I should be by her side.

390
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,083
She's...

391
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,377
going through something at the moment,

392
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,756
and I'm the only one she has.

393
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:55,343
I want to see if there's anything I can do

394
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:56,928
to help unburden her.

395
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,264
But still...

396
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,475
This thought struck me

397
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,853
when I saw my mom the other day.

398
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,314
I've been feeling lonely,

399
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:13,194
thinking that I'm all alone in the world.

400
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,953
But perhaps my mom is lonelier
than anybody else at the moment.

401
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:29,627
I now have Soo-bin,

402
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,171
you,

403
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,174
and Mr. Oh in my life.

404
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,678
Are you hesitant because of Soo-bin?

405
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,825
Mom, I'm going to the academy.

406
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,535
Study hard even during the break.

407
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,036
Okay, I will.

408
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:13,963
Hello?

409
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:19,802
Yes.

410
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:32,064
Hello, thank you for making time
to meet with me.

411
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:36,777
What's up?

412
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,949
I heard you did much better
on the exams this time.

413
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,577
And I've decided on my major.

414
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,413
I want to go to art school.

415
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:51,000
I started going to an art academy too.

416
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,711
Art school? It'll be tough.

417
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,171
That's okay.

418
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,424
What did you want to talk to me about?

419
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:03,054
If you're going to ask
for my permission to date Soo-bin,

420
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,681
you won't get my answer.
I hope you understand.

421
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,184
No, it's not about that.

422
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,686
I have

423
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,439
a favor to ask of you.

424
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,441
That's why I called.

425
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,401
What is it?

426
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,239
Please allow me...

427
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:24,867
to hang out with Soo-bin for just one day.

428
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,745
Why not just hang out with her
without asking me?

429
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,624
Please give her your permission

430
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:36,504
so that she can hang out with me
without feeling bad.

431
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:42,051
I plan to move back to where my mom is...

432
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,681
so that I can be by her side.

433
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,355
Which means I won't be able
to see Soo-bin for a while.

434
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:58,317
Why all of a sudden? Did something happen?

435
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,071
She has a bit of a situation now.

436
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:04,365
But...

437
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,036
I'd like to tell Soo-bin myself.

438
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:12,206
I'd appreciate it

439
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,917
if you could keep it from her until then.

440
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,253
Please don't tell her.

441
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:22,800
All right.

442
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,428
I won't tell her.

443
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,513
Thank you.

444
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:31,058
Jun-u.

445
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:38,107
Thank you so much
for comforting Soo-bin back then.

446
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,319
And I think

447
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,238
I reacted too emotionally.

448
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:45,906
I'm sorry.

449
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,827
Don't worry.

450
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,167
I'll be going then.

451
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,460
Okay.

452
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:14,894
Hi.

453
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:16,854
Where are you?

454
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:18,481
I'm at the academy.

455
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,608
Are you on your way home?

456
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:24,987
Yes.

457
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:26,530
Is something wrong?

458
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:28,908
Well...

459
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,036
It's just that we don't
see each other as often.

460
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:36,165
And the break began,
so we can't meet at school either.

461
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:39,919
You should go home.

462
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,381
Jun-u, it's a bit tiring, isn't it?

463
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:46,926
Let's hang in there until the day

464
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:50,221
my mom approves of our relationship
and we can meet freely.

465
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:55,309
Actually, it doesn't matter to me.

466
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,645
Should we meet now?

467
00:39:58,813 --> 00:39:59,814
No.

468
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:02,900
Until the day.

469
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:04,860
Go home now.

470
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:06,570
Okay.

471
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:08,572
Bye.

472
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:09,698
Bye.

473
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:17,289
-I'm home.
-Did you study hard?

474
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,209
Have you been somewhere?

475
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,421
What? I just stepped out for a moment.

476
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,382
Hey.

477
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:28,759
You...

478
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,223
It's summer break now.
Why don't you meet him once?

479
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,267
Who do you mean?

480
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,103
Jun-u.

481
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:42,857
Why are you saying this?

482
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:44,775
You asked me

483
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,445
to trust you.

484
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:49,155
Also, your grades went up.

485
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,948
You said he's been working hard too.

486
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:54,785
I'm not saying you can go out with him.
Just meet him and get some fresh air.

487
00:40:58,789 --> 00:40:59,623
Thanks, Mom.

488
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:02,543
Meeting him with your permission
even for a day would be great.

489
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,378
You don't seem too excited.

490
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,548
I am. Thank you.

491
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:11,135
Jun-u, the thing you asked for
the other day.

492
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,138
Thank you.

493
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,182
He gives private lessons around there.

494
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,933
-Give him a call.
-I will.

495
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,811
I really hope you'll win a prize.

496
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,983
I don't think I will.
All the other kids were so good.

497
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,277
Jun-u.

498
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,404
Choe Jun-u.

499
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:35,826
I'll make you an offer you can't refuse.

500
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:39,705
Jun-u, will you go
on a date with me? All day?

501
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,833
I have my mom's permission.

502
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,084
Okay.

503
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:48,380
Are you at the academy? Focus.

504
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:49,965
Let's talk later.

505
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,010
Okay.

506
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,471
Thanks. I'll talk to you later.

507
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,039
Good. Like that.

508
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,090
He's painting.

509
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,144
Jun-u.

510
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:50,776
Jun-u, your skills have improved so much.

511
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:54,446
What did I tell you?
I'm good at recognizing talent.

512
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:57,700
So why?

513
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,620
I heard you're quitting the academy.

514
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,335
Well...

515
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:15,551
I should've told you first.

516
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,557
I think I should go to my mom.

517
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,811
What do you mean?

518
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,151
Are you saying you're transferring?

519
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:36,322
My mom is in a bit of a situation.

520
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:41,827
I think I should stay with her
and help her as much as I can.

521
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,417
Jun-u.

522
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,961
I hope this doesn't hurt your feelings.

523
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:54,048
Will you let me help you?

524
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:03,098
Mr. Oh.

525
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,144
I appreciate

526
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,480
your concern.

527
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,489
I mean...

528
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,742
You're all settled now.

529
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:25,287
You found what you want to do,
and you're going to a good academy.

530
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:29,041
To me, it seems like
everything is finally in place.

531
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,504
That's why I'm going.

532
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:38,509
Now I know I can do well

533
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,345
wherever I go.

534
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,310
You're running away right now!

535
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:52,147
Fine, walk away trying to look
all cool. Well, you don't.

536
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:53,816
Hey!

537
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:58,737
Jun-u! You're only running away!

538
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:09,998
All right, Jun-u.

539
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:14,628
Go.

540
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:18,632
Go to your mom

541
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,135
and be with her.

542
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:25,389
I think you can do that now.

543
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:31,186
Without you, I would...

544
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:33,856
I'd feel a little empty.

545
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:39,194
But I think you can do that.

546
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:35,083
Soo-bin.

547
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,169
You look pretty.

548
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,715
Do I look okay?

549
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,258
You look very pretty.

550
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:48,639
See you later.

551
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,641
Okay?

552
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:53,977
Soo-bin.

553
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,605
One more thing.

554
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:04,238
I've given some thought to what you said.
A lot of thought, actually.

555
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,539
Thank you so much...

556
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:18,252
for giving me courage.

557
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:23,590
Soo-bin, I'll try to do as you said.

558
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,103
I love you, Mom.

559
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:38,564
I love you so much.

560
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,691
I'm sorry.

561
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:52,077
-Hi.
-Hi.

562
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,401
-Like this?
-Yes.

563
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,528
One, two, three.

564
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:11,865
One more time. One, two, three.

565
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:48,485
Pil-sang.

566
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:51,988
Do you want to go out with me?

567
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:53,448
What?

568
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:57,285
I'm saying it just one more time.

569
00:49:58,453 --> 00:50:00,080
Let's go out.

570
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:04,793
Goodness.

571
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,421
-What are you doing?
-Sit down!

572
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,673
-Sit down!
-Gosh.

573
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:11,341
-Are you crazy?
-Sit down.

574
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:12,592
I can't see the screen.

575
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:21,184
This feels nice.

576
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:23,437
Yes.

577
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:42,456
Soo-bin.

578
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:45,250
Yes?

579
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:48,962
I have something to tell you.

580
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:50,422
I know.

581
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:57,304
I kept having this strange feeling,

582
00:50:58,054 --> 00:51:00,307
so I called your mom.

583
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,769
Since you visited your mom last time,

584
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,855
something's been bothering me.

585
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:10,525
She said

586
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,653
you're insisting on coming to live
with her

587
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,697
even though she told you not to.

588
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,163
I'm sorry for telling you too late.

589
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,293
What do you think I said?

590
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:38,970
Hello, this is Yoo Soo-bin.

591
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:42,057
Yes. I've been doing well. Thank you.

592
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:45,727
Well... I was wondering

593
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:48,939
what's up with Jun-u lately.

594
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,149
He seemed down lately,

595
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:53,652
so I got worried and called you.

596
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:58,782
It's okay. You can tell me.

597
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:01,785
No matter how much I try to stop him,

598
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:05,956
Jun-u's insisting that
he should come here to live with me

599
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:08,500
because he's too worried about me.

600
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:12,254
So I eventually agreed.

601
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:14,756
You must be very upset, Soo-bin.

602
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,300
Right? I feel so bad.

603
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,762
I'm really okay on my own.

604
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,223
I'm sure

605
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,518
Jun-u thought about it a lot.

606
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,812
No matter where Jun-u lives,

607
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:32,232
what's important is for him to feel
at ease.

608
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,026
He can keep studying hard

609
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,904
and focus on his art studies.

610
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:39,656
That's what's important.

611
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:43,702
I'll be staying in touch with Jun-u,

612
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,745
so don't worry.

613
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:56,214
Jun-u, it must've been so tough for you.

614
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:02,929
But Jun-u,

615
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,976
although I said that to your mom,

616
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,021
I...

617
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,315
still feel...

618
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:25,493
Soo-bin, to be honest,

619
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:29,664
you're the one that worries me the most.

620
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:40,550
But,

621
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:43,428
just because I go live with my mom

622
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:47,599
doesn't mean it's over between us.

623
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,941
Let's do what we have to do for now
and wait

624
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,485
a little longer.

625
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:03,573
Okay.

626
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:07,035
From now on,

627
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:11,373
let's never wear sad or depressed faces.

628
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,249
Promise me.

629
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:20,256
I promise.

630
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:27,472
You're so kind, Soo-bin.

631
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,642
You're so kind, Jun-u.

632
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,162
YOU HAVE WON SECOND PRIZE!

633
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:54,249
Hey, Jun-u. You won second prize...

634
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,209
You won second prize?

635
00:54:58,545 --> 00:54:59,838
Congratulations!

636
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,716
I feel so proud of you.

637
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:10,265
-Soo-bin.
-Congratulations.

638
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:16,396
Congratulations, Jun-u.

639
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,064
Thank you.

640
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,316
-Great job.
-Thank you.

641
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,362
That was so fast.

642
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,574
How about another lap?

643
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,493
That was already our seventh lap.

644
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,079
You should go inside now.

645
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:37,417
Okay.

646
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:40,378
Good night.

647
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:51,347
Soo-bin.

648
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:01,816
I have a favor to ask you.

649
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:04,819
What is it?

650
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:08,323
When I leave,

651
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:13,578
I don't think you should come.

652
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:19,876
Why not?

653
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:26,341
I don't want you to see me leaving.

654
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,527
I'll come back to see you.

655
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:53,660
I'll be even more handsome when I return.

656
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:10,343
Go.

657
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:28,736
You'll see my mom when you get there.

658
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,322
Thank you, sir.

659
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:54,762
Jun-u is leaving today, right?

660
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:56,806
Yes.

661
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:00,435
Shouldn't you go see him and say goodbye?

662
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:02,187
I have to do this.

663
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:03,730
I have a test at the academy today.

664
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:07,775
All right.

665
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:38,556
It's like another world.

666
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:40,350
It is another world.

667
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:41,976
The world I live in.

668
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:48,191
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

669
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:49,692
-Happy birthday to you
-Blow them out.

670
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:51,486
Many happy returns.

671
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:53,488
Jun-u.

672
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:36,990
I'm going to the academy.

673
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:38,783
Soo-bin.

674
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:44,414
Have a good day.

675
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:21,618
Bumbi.

676
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:35,173
Password, Soo-bin's birthday.

677
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:43,640
You, again?

678
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:45,933
Yes, it's me.

679
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:42,031
No...

680
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:25,867
Jun-u.

681
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:29,036
Choe Jun-u!

682
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:30,788
Jun-u.

683
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:35,084
Choe Jun-u! Jun-u.

684
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:38,796
Jun-u.

685
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:41,674
Choe Jun-u!

686
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:02,528
Jun-u!

687
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:33,768
Soo-bin.

688
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:04,423
Even though we have to say goodbye now,

689
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:07,426
this goodbye isn't forever

690
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:12,515
because all the moments we've shared
are still shining so radiantly

691
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:15,309
and the dazzling moments
I'm having at the age of 18

692
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:17,687
are truly beautiful.

693
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:51,364
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING MOMENT OF EIGHTEEN

694
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:58,412
