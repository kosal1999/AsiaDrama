1
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,378
Have some more water.
I'll go get my phone.

2
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:46,463
Okay.

3
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,135
Hey! Hey, hurry.

4
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,429
Come over here!

5
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,829
It must be our housekeeper.

6
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,888
It's okay. It's all good.

7
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,685
Jun-u.

8
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,564
Mom.

9
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,486
Come here.

10
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,629
So... You two are...

11
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:14,008
Is that why you asked me
about my first love last time?

12
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:17,762
Are you two...

13
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,181
-You know...
-Yes.

14
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,641
Yes, we're...

15
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:24,102
Hello, I'm Yoo Soo-bin.

16
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,770
Yes, hi.

17
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,648
Of course I know you,

18
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:29,899
Soo-bin.

19
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,276
I was about to tell you,

20
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,153
but it hasn't been long...

21
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,155
since we started dating.

22
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:40,994
Right. And some stuff
happened recently as well.

23
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:48,042
Congratulations, guys!
Congratulations, Jun-u.

24
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,213
So you two are actually going out, right?

25
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,299
Right?

26
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:02,223
Congratulations.
Huge congratulations to both of you.

27
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,394
Let me have a good look at you, Soo-bin.

28
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,814
My son Jun-u's first love.

29
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:17,697
Thank you for being Jun-u's first love.

30
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,035
My gosh, why am I tearing up?

31
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,414
Gosh.

32
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:33,171
I can't believe such a cool girl
like you is my son's girlfriend now.

33
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,049
This makes me so happy.

34
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,052
Thank you.

35
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,224
By the way, what happened, Mom?

36
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,017
What?

37
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,489
Why do yours look the same?

38
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,407
Let me see.

39
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,375
At first, I wasn't going to do it.

40
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,418
Soo-bin's mom was also
uncomfortable with it.

41
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,046
But if you think about it,

42
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:18,967
it's just a job, you know.

43
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:23,763
I figured it'd be better than doing
nothing during the renovations.

44
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:30,770
But I should've thought more
about it from your perspective.

45
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,772
I made such a rash decision, didn't I?

46
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,735
And if Soo-bin is your girlfriend now...

47
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,822
What do we do?
You're uncomfortable with it, right?

48
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,448
No, I'm fine with it.

49
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:46,160
I'm just worried that it might
have been hard for you.

50
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,416
No, not at all.

51
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:56,129
You know I like to drive, cook, and clean.

52
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,463
It's perfect for me.

53
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,053
My gosh, I should get going.

54
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,681
-I have to go pick up Soo-bin's mom.
-Okay.

55
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,267
She doesn't know that you guys
are going out yet, right?

56
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:11,728
No, she doesn't.

57
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,187
Just tell her.

58
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,566
I don't want you guys
to hide it from anyone.

59
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,485
I feel bad that I know about it
when she has no idea.

60
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:20,945
We'll tell her.

61
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:24,282
But maybe not right away.

62
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,035
Right?

63
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,912
You'll need some time
to mentally prepare yourself.

64
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:33,875
But don't take too long, okay?

65
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:34,959
Okay.

66
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:36,669
I'm off.

67
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,421
I hope your shift goes well today.

68
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,048
Drive safely, Mom.

69
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,758
-I will.
-Good.

70
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:43,926
Bye.

71
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,185
Once again, huge congratulations
to you, Jun-u.

72
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,020
My son's first love!

73
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,397
Oh, my! She's his first love.

74
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,319
Bye, Mom.

75
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,415
Mom.

76
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:30,098
You couldn't come with me
because we ran into my mom.

77
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,100
My mom just left.

78
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,811
Are your hiccups completely gone?

79
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,688
Yes. They're gone.

80
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,732
I can see that.

81
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:44,779
Soo-bin.

82
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,829
I was on my way to the convenience
store because I was worried,

83
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,205
but you're here.

84
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,254
I'm sorry. I really had no idea.

85
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,215
Why are you sorry?

86
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,092
My mom

87
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,469
just works for your mom.

88
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,310
Are you uncomfortable with it?

89
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,897
I'm really okay with it.

90
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:23,609
No, I'm fine if you're okay with it.

91
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,199
I'm glad that my mom is fond of you.

92
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,118
Although I knew she'd be.

93
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:40,460
By the way, your mom is so nice.

94
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,462
She's like a girl.

95
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,130
Right?

96
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:49,760
My mom thinks we should tell your mom
about our relationship.

97
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,514
She feels bad that she knows
when your mom doesn't.

98
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,393
Right, I understand.

99
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,903
Let's go.

100
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,243
Thanks for walking me.

101
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,829
Take it easy.

102
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,082
I will. I'll think about you.

103
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,170
-I'll be off, then.
-Okay.

104
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:32,762
Get going.

105
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,223
All right.

106
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,683
Bye.

107
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,019
-Get home safely.
-I will.

108
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,277
What took you so long?

109
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,987
Where have you been?

110
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,198
I was at the library because of
the performance assessment.

111
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,159
You should've called me.
I would've sent the driver over.

112
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,744
Are you tired?

113
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,253
-Hey.
-Hey, you need to see this.

114
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,380
Someone posted something strange.

115
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,803
I THINK MA HWI-YEONG IN CLASS THREE
RIGGED HIS GRADES

116
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,812
What is this nonsense?

117
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,537
Is this rumor about Hwi-yeong true?

118
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,332
CHAN YEOL:
IS THIS RUMOR ABOUT HWI-YEONG TRUE?

119
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:27,209
Come on. Why would he?
He always gets the highest grades.

120
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,545
Maybe that's why
he always gets the highest grades.

121
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,005
Do you think it's true?

122
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,556
I have to say,
it doesn't sound like a mere rumor.

123
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,100
I'll find out!

124
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:44,727
Ro-mi.

125
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,773
RO-MI LEFT THE ROOM

126
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,407
Gi-tae, is it true?

127
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,203
We don't know anything for sure yet.

128
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,163
Let's just study.

129
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,582
I'm just curious.

130
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,800
-Yes, ma'am.
-Right.

131
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,802
-We're looking into it.
-We're not sure...

132
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,720
-Please don't worry.
-Say we're looking into it.

133
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,847
We're looking into it now, ma'am.

134
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,516
Don't be too concerned.

135
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,146
Hello, ma'am. Right.

136
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,315
-I see.
-We're looking into it now.

137
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,525
-My gosh.
-That's right.

138
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,360
Mr. Oh, did you see this?

139
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,737
Yes, just now. I was in the classroom.

140
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,324
Ms. Bae, what are you waiting for?

141
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,659
Delete the post immediately.

142
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:44,954
Oh, hold on.
We shouldn't just delete the post.

143
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:48,249
We have the full right to delete any posts
that contain false information.

144
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,669
Yes, I'm aware. But I'm afraid
it might stir up more suspicion.

145
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,171
We should post something official
explaining the situation

146
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,756
before deleting the post.

147
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,299
-Or--
-The kids are so fast.

148
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,677
They've already reposted it everywhere.

149
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:06,517
-This is crazy.
-All my friends know about it too.

150
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,895
The rumors will quiet down soon.
This happened last year too.

151
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,941
My grandma said a rumor is
usually true if you keep hearing it.

152
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,569
Hey, what did Hwi-yeong say about this?

153
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:20,406
Oh, right.
You guys aren't on good terms now.

154
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,658
What did Gi-tae say?

155
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,202
Right, you're in the same boat.

156
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,704
Then what about O-je?

157
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,915
Gosh, you too.

158
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,253
What is the matter with all of you?

159
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,338
Da-huin, go home.

160
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,674
You're bringing everyone down.

161
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,718
My house is really hectic right now

162
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,261
since my relatives visited.

163
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,306
I just want to stay here.

164
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:48,350
Do you think my house is
some kind of care home?

165
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,566
HWI-YEONG

166
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:09,246
SCHOOL BULLETIN BOARD
COMMENTS

167
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,916
Stop looking at it.

168
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,584
There's no need.

169
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,544
Did something happen?

170
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:19,006
-Something I don't know about.
-No. Nothing happened.

171
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,758
So don't worry about it.

172
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,052
And keep studying.

173
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,555
You shouldn't worry either.

174
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,601
And stop drinking.

175
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,144
I didn't drink.

176
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:33,729
It was just juice.

177
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,442
You should study.

178
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,781
Yeon-u, did you wait long?

179
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,074
Did you bring what I asked you?

180
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,158
Yes.

181
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,828
Did you see the post?
The moms are going crazy.

182
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:50,955
Leave them be.

183
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,415
Once Hwi-yeong gets
the highest grades again,

184
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,459
they'll compliment him
like it never happened.

185
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,046
You had your cast taken off.

186
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,966
I did. That's why I came late.

187
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,302
Well, I guess you won't need me anymore.

188
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,222
Why? We still have some time left
on our agreement.

189
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,683
Still, you're well now.

190
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,561
I still feel a bit uncomfortable.
Why don't you help me a little more?

191
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,940
It turns out that my son

192
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,984
has a new girlfriend.

193
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,736
-Oh, my god!
-No, a rat? Where?

194
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,446
It's not a rat.

195
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,490
How could your son start dating so soon?

196
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,493
He's a senior next year.
This is a big problem.

197
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,080
I feel so bad for you. Goodness.

198
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,583
Yes, it is a big problem.

199
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,731
Did you get off work?

200
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,525
Yes.

201
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,277
Are you coming from the academy?

202
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,528
Yes.

203
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,990
You must be tired. I'll see you tomorrow.

204
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:10,784
Okay.

205
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,747
But...

206
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,334
You're pretending not to know.

207
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,461
You probably saw the post.

208
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,217
There's no reason for me to bring it up.

209
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,265
To be honest,

210
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,893
I can't be nice to you.

211
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,066
See you.

212
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,033
That punk acts tough,

213
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,494
but he's actually more vulnerable
than anyone.

214
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,372
You're a true teacher.

215
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,917
You were so furious about Hwi-yeong's mom,

216
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,002
but you're still worried about him.

217
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,297
Do you know that's all you've been
talking about since earlier?

218
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,674
Have I?

219
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,427
I'm sorry. You must've been bored.

220
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,387
A little bit.

221
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:12,805
A little bit?

222
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,893
My mom

223
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,312
always told me to become
the top student as well.

224
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,816
How could you not get a perfect score?
Look at me.

225
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,025
Look at me!

226
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:28,112
You must get a perfect score
and become the best.

227
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,948
Didn't I tell you
that's the only way you can survive?

228
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,032
Oh Han-gyeol!

229
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:35,119
She was such a frightening
and hysterical mom to me,

230
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:39,581
and whenever I looked at her,
she seemed unhappy.

231
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,711
So I tried my best to make my mom happy,

232
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,964
but things didn't turn out well
in the end.

233
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,135
Later on, I had trouble attending school,

234
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,054
so I dropped out
when I was in eighth grade.

235
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,560
Eventually, I didn't get
into the university my mom wanted.

236
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,525
I blamed my mom so much
while I was growing up,

237
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:12,072
but she passed away from an illness
when I was in university.

238
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,828
After that,

239
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,414
I felt a huge sense of regret,

240
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:24,001
and I felt so sorry for my mom

241
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,296
who devoted her life to me.

242
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,090
I felt sorry for the Han-gyeol
back then as well.

243
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,516
I'm sorry. I suddenly ruined the mood.

244
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,186
Mr. Oh.

245
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,481
Your mom must be truly happy

246
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,025
since you've become
such an amazing teacher.

247
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,111
You think so?

248
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,362
Of course.

249
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:56,366
"Oh, my. My Han-gyeol,
I'm so proud of you."

250
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,576
That's what she'll say.

251
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,621
I really hope that's true.

252
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,956
It's probably Hwi-yeong's
previous homeroom teacher.

253
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,295
We've done more than enough for him.
What more does he want?

254
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:11,048
Maybe the person who posted that

255
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,925
is Mr. Oh Han-gyeol.

256
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,885
We need to change his homeroom teacher.

257
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,678
How can we change it again?

258
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,640
Is that all you can think of
after going through that mess?

259
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,353
-What are you talking about?
-How have you been behaving at school

260
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,938
for something like that to be posted?

261
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,190
Did something happen
between you and Mr. Kim?

262
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,484
Is that why he was injured...

263
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,985
Don't be silly.

264
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,529
And what is this about Mr. Oh?

265
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,948
What have you two been up to?

266
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,575
What? Don't you know
everything was for your sake?

267
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,452
If you just did well on your own,

268
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,371
do you think I would've
been humiliated like that?

269
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,414
Honey! Don't.

270
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,459
Hwi-yeong, let's go upstairs. Let's go.

271
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,963
There's someone else I'm suspicious of.

272
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,131
Who?

273
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:55,342
You know, that genius you like so much.

274
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,763
Hwi-yeong is probably experiencing
a mental breakdown by now.

275
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:13,569
My mom thinks we should tell
your mom about our relationship.

276
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,864
She feels bad that she knows
when your mom doesn't.

277
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,963
Hey, you know that guy?

278
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,423
No,

279
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,759
you know my driver, right?

280
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,136
Her son has a girlfriend now.

281
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,638
Does that make sense?

282
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,058
He's so thoughtless.

283
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,978
His mom is working her butt off right now.

284
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,314
I guess he doesn't care
about getting into college.

285
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,068
Hey, Soo-bin.

286
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:58,238
You better study really hard this time.

287
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,199
You have to do good on the finals.

288
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,702
You better not forget that Hwi-yeong's mom

289
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,288
kicked you out of the private lesson team
because of your grades.

290
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,790
Never forget that sense of humiliation.

291
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,626
Okay?

292
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,754
Why? Do you have something to say?

293
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,881
Something to say?

294
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,050
I'm just feeling thirsty.

295
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,718
Go get some water.

296
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,138
I hope the post
about that rat's son is true

297
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,141
so that she gets humiliated really hard.

298
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:42,699
Soo-bin.

299
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,542
-Let's go.
-Okay.

300
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,388
Hi, Hwi-yeong.

301
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,475
That means exams are coming up.
Oh, right. The finals.

302
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,185
"Oh, no, the finals!"

303
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,147
You're suspecting me, aren't you?

304
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:16,817
It wasn't me.

305
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,027
Why would I post something like that?

306
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,904
My dad got a promotion,

307
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,406
I didn't have to transfer,

308
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,533
and I even joined an exclusive
private lesson team

309
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,118
that I could never afford.

310
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,412
Why would I betray
such a grateful friend...

311
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,414
Oh, gosh.

312
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,000
Sang-hun.

313
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,418
What do you want, Gi-tae?

314
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,336
Didn't you quit being Hwi-yeong's butler?

315
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,255
Hey, Gi-tae.

316
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,048
Don't mind us, and just go.

317
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,600
What is this?
Some sort of broken friendship?

318
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,562
This is quite interesting.

319
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,316
Hwi-yeong, I'll be your best friend
from now on then.

320
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,569
Why? I'll be nice.

321
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,279
I'll be a good friend, Hwi-yeong.

322
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:08,952
Don't worry.

323
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,831
I bumped into Hwi-yeong last night
on the way home from work.

324
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,042
He said it wasn't bothering him.

325
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:18,962
Let's go.

326
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,467
Are you doing what Jun-u did?

327
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,843
This worked for Jun-u.

328
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:27,888
What the... Are you giving up on Ro-mi?

329
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,097
Is that a fish?

330
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,515
You bastard.

331
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,100
I'm serious right now.

332
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,811
I doubt she'll like that
if you give it to her.

333
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,565
Your drawing isn't really screaming
that you're serious.

334
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:43,278
Pil-sang, let me see.

335
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,573
Hand it over.

336
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,742
HWANG RO-MI

337
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:51,036
You need to draw an outline first.

338
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:53,580
Like this.

339
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,333
Now, you have the outline.

340
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,503
-Then...
-Oh, my god.

341
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,089
Jun-u, you can really draw.

342
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:05,050
Now, you have to highlight her features.

343
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:07,719
How'd you describe her face?

344
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,930
She has a small face and beautiful eyes.

345
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:11,807
-Like this?
-Oh, my.

346
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,642
-It looks just like her.
-Gosh, Jun-u!

347
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,851
What else?

348
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,144
Her under-eye bags look cute.

349
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,354
-Under-eye bags?
-Yes.

350
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,524
And her bangs look like mine.

351
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,653
Okay, got it.

352
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,407
Da-huin, let's go have some food.

353
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,409
You'll really faint at this rate.

354
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:36,123
Da-huin, are you this distraught
because of a boy? Don't be such a loser.

355
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,375
Get back at him by going out
with someone better than him.

356
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,502
Yes, I am a loser.

357
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:42,712
Do you know what love is?

358
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:46,133
All you do is lie.
You have no idea what true love is!

359
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,009
-Girls, I'm hungry.
-Who do you think you are?

360
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,053
-Calm down.
-Who do you think you are?

361
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,388
Hey, O-je.

362
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,810
-What's your problem?
-Ro-mi.

363
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,854
How dare you make Da-huin starve herself?

364
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:01,022
Who do you think you are
to give her such a hard time?

365
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,317
Hey, why are you hitting O-je
out of the blue?

366
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,570
Take it up with me. Why hit O-je?

367
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:08,697
You saw that, right?

368
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,365
You need to take responsibility.

369
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:12,617
Give back all the love
you've received from her.

370
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,703
How could you end things like that?

371
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:16,371
Have some manners.

372
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,171
Da-huin.

373
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,259
Da-huin clearly
still has enough energy left.

374
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:30,635
She won't die.

375
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:32,971
Mr. Oh.

376
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,558
I'd like you to be honest with me.

377
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,812
-About what?
-About my parents' faults.

378
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,274
-What?
-I'm sorry about the petition

379
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,734
for a new homeroom teacher.

380
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,569
Don't worry about it.

381
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:50,530
The mothers did that
because they want you guys

382
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,033
to get better grades. That's all.

383
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,534
And they withdrew it right away.

384
00:24:56,036 --> 00:25:00,165
You must be bothered by the post
on our website.

385
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,419
Are you suspicious of me as well?

386
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,009
No.

387
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,136
I trust you.

388
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:14,930
Hwi-yeong, you see...

389
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,934
It's very unlikely,

390
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,854
but even if something unexpected
did happen,

391
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:28,652
I'm sure you wouldn't have
anything to do with it.

392
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,656
I never cheated or rigged my grades.

393
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,494
I'm aware. I know that, of course.

394
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,416
Hey, have you eaten yet?

395
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,836
-Shall we go eat something?
-No. I should get back.

396
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,770
Mr. Oh is in a meeting,
so I'll give you guys a few updates.

397
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,605
There isn't anything special.

398
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,858
I've posted all the updates
regarding the performance assessment.

399
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,112
Hwi-yeong. The rumors about
rigged grades aren't true, right?

400
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,118
There's another post?

401
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,833
What do you guys think?

402
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,129
I'm just curious. That's all.

403
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,201
Let's get ready for the next class.

404
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:21,973
We must quell the rumors
before they spread further.

405
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,100
I really hope
things don't get out of hand.

406
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,311
Shouldn't we release
an official statement?

407
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:29,022
No. Why should we
when it's not true at all?

408
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:32,359
Mr. Oh, please do your best to make sure

409
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,486
your students aren't distracted
by the rumors.

410
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:37,155
All of you should make sure

411
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,532
your students don't spread
the false rumors.

412
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,826
You'll have to firmly warn them, okay?

413
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,911
Yes, sir.

414
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,999
Da-huin's Breakup Project.

415
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,168
It begins now!

416
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,837
Hello, everyone. My name is Kwon Da-huin.

417
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:56,800
My boyfriend and I broke up
a few days ago.

418
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,359
How's Da-huin holding up? Is she okay?

419
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,487
All my friends are distraught now.

420
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,489
It's stressing me out.

421
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:21,825
Let's cheer up.

422
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,868
Here, it's red ginseng.

423
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:29,082
I usually drink this when I study.
I brought it for you.

424
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,458
Thanks.

425
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,220
STUDY PLAN FOR FINAL EXAMS

426
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,722
This is pretty intense.

427
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,142
But I must follow this plan.

428
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:50,979
I have to improve my grades even though
we're going out. Then I can tell my mom.

429
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,940
I have to do very well on the exams.

430
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,987
Don't be too stressed out, though.

431
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:02,991
Things don't go your way
when you try too hard.

432
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,288
Don't say that. I have to do well.

433
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:11,082
We promised your mom

434
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:14,210
that we'll tell my mom
about our relationship.

435
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,464
Yes, let's do that.

436
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,010
What is this?

437
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:26,097
We can't even tell people
that we're going out.

438
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,683
We have to hide all the time.

439
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,769
Are we living in the Joseon era or what?

440
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,063
It's because we're 18.

441
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,900
What's wrong with our age?

442
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:40,069
Is being 18 a sin?

443
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,946
Are we not allowed to like each other?

444
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:44,491
Maybe it is a sin.

445
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:46,868
Why?

446
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,207
We learned about the most brilliant thing

447
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,251
at the most brilliant time of our lives.

448
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,465
I guess you could call it a sin.

449
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:08,264
You're actually from the future,
aren't you?

450
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:13,102
You're about a million years old,
and you realized

451
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:16,773
this was the best time of your life,
so you traveled back in time.

452
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,609
Gosh, I'm in trouble.

453
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:22,153
Why? What's wrong?

454
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,618
How did you know...

455
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,329
that I'm from the future?

456
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,541
Sit down.

457
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,378
Sit.

458
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,758
What should I do with you?

459
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,099
Should we just

460
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:53,977
be reckless?

461
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,187
How about we just tell everyone
that we're dating?

462
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:00,692
We'll stop running away or lying.

463
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,947
"We're dating.
We're in a relationship." Like that.

464
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:09,409
No, I don't want you to do
anything reckless.

465
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,163
And I don't want to see you intimidated.

466
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:18,376
You're always hiding behind
the trees in my neighborhood.

467
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,796
I'm not intimidated.

468
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,507
Hiding is fun.

469
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,344
Still...

470
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,556
I'm sorry.

471
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:33,850
I feel bad.

472
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,573
I'm happy, but it feels weird.

473
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,284
How so?

474
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,123
It makes me sigh.

475
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,087
Same here.

476
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,829
My gosh!

477
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,707
It's my dad.

478
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,751
I'm glad. You should say hi to my dad.

479
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,505
Right now?

480
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:49,759
Yes, my dad isn't like my mom,
so he'll understand everything.

481
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,137
Wait.

482
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,350
Wait, I missed the call.

483
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,853
I'll call him back.

484
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,944
Hi, Soo-bin. I'm--

485
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,533
I told you not to call Soo-bin
without my permission.

486
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:15,410
Goodness, how could you be so inflexible?

487
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:18,371
I don't have time.
What is it you wanted to talk about?

488
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,959
Here. I brought the divorce documents.

489
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,133
I'm not getting divorced. Are we done?

490
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,467
Hey, Song-hui.

491
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,552
Let go.

492
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,973
We don't love each other.

493
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,016
What did you say?

494
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,934
We don't love each other.

495
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:41,769
For goodness' sake.

496
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,647
Are you 18?

497
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,607
To bring up love in this situation?

498
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,318
What should we do then?
Keep living like this?

499
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,820
Keep living uncomfortably like this?

500
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:53,156
Unlike you, I'm not uncomfortable at all.

501
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:55,825
Don't you think
you're paying for what you did?

502
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,243
Hey, Song-hui.

503
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,495
The more you do this,

504
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,664
the more exhausted you'll get.

505
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,459
I hope you get exhausted
in the process as well.

506
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,502
Mr. Yoo Jong-su.

507
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,964
Good luck living a nice life like that.

508
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,383
And if you file a divorce lawsuit,

509
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,052
you know that it's unfavorable
for you, right?

510
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,887
Since it's your fault our marriage failed.

511
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:21,893
You should have some dignity
at least, as Soo-bin's dad.

512
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,478
Okay? Goodbye.

513
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,404
Your meeting ended early.

514
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:34,655
Yes.

515
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:51,130
He came with her.

516
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:06,896
Should I run them over?

517
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:18,699
What are you doing?

518
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,494
Wait. Hey, stop!

519
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:23,871
No, what are you doing?

520
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,044
Are you crazy?

521
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,111
Hello, my daughter.

522
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,113
You're studying hard.

523
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,907
I made a promise with you.

524
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,117
Cookies?

525
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,954
Yes. They're from the driver.

526
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,667
Isn't your arm okay now?

527
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,335
Do you still need a driver?

528
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,922
I wanted to pretend it still hurt
to keep her,

529
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,757
but she quit.

530
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,594
She'll return to her previous job now.

531
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:25,224
You must've gotten really close
to your driver.

532
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,269
Yes. She makes me feel comfortable.

533
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,521
We've decided to be friends.

534
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:31,939
Really?

535
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,149
Yes.

536
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,235
Keep studying then.

537
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,320
Okay.

538
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,750
I think your mom and my mom
became friends.

539
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,877
This is good news for us, right?

540
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:02,178
It is.

541
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:08,684
Now, all you have to do is
do well on the final exams.

542
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:09,894
Let's study hard!

543
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,104
Okay. Don't worry.

544
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,536
STUDY PLAN FOR FINAL EXAMS

545
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,667
Good. This is good.

546
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,353
The caller is not available...

547
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,813
What is Ji-min doing?

548
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,107
I can't reach her all day.

549
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:58,234
Does she have another test today?

550
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:04,323
Hwi-yeong, how are things going?

551
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:08,202
If you have anything to discuss,
you can call me anytime. Okay?

552
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:13,916
Thank you.

553
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,336
Gosh, that emotionless punk.

554
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,047
He should at least use an emoticon.

555
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,188
Bro.

556
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,608
What do I do?

557
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,154
I'm afraid.

558
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:46,907
Yes.

559
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,285
I'm on my way home from work.

560
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:53,205
What about you, Mom?
Did you arrive safely?

561
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,500
You must've had a lot of work to do.

562
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,337
Don't worry, I'll do fine.

563
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,841
Mom. Are you crying again?

564
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:05,718
No, right?

565
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,014
Don't worry.

566
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,017
I can do well on my own.

567
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,605
Okay.

568
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,108
Okay.

569
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,941
Do you still sleep with the lights on?

570
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,194
Well...

571
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,572
You should practice sleeping
with them off.

572
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:09,990
You can fix it.

573
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,120
Then...

574
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:19,208
Imagine that I'm next to you.

575
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:22,420
Next to me?

576
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,546
Yes.

577
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:27,133
Imagine that I'm by your side,
protecting you.

578
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,020
Did you turn the lights off?

579
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:41,856
Yes.

580
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:43,858
Do you feel sleepy?

581
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,026
Not that much.

582
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,195
Even when I said I'd protect you?

583
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:51,532
That's what's making it harder.

584
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,451
Why?

585
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:56,287
Because imagining you lying beside me

586
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:57,913
makes my heart flutter.

587
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,169
Don't worry. I'll help you go to sleep.

588
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:04,920
All right.

589
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,548
Close your eyes.

590
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,259
You're feeling sleepy.

591
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:14,054
It's okay.

592
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,557
You feel comfortable.

593
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,435
You feel comfortable.

594
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:24,667
You're doing great.

595
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:38,847
You got it.

596
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,101
My gosh, I'm really proud of you.

597
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:45,563
Well done. You make me so proud!

598
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,446
I'm sorry. I got too excited

599
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,198
because you did so well.

600
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,787
Why does this

601
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:06,292
remind me of the story about
the princess and On Dal the Fool?

602
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:07,585
Gosh, come on.

603
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:11,714
I'm just really proud that you solved
the question we studied together.

604
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:15,926
Right, but are you proud of me
because I'm like On Dal the Fool?

605
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:19,972
You know what?
That should be your nickname.

606
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,765
Jun Dal.

607
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,059
Jun Dal, not On Dal.

608
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,562
I'm Little Pea,

609
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:28,439
and you're Jun Dal.

610
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,858
Jun Dal, it is. Jun Dal!

611
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,276
Isn't it such a cute nickname?

612
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:35,321
Jun Dal. Hey, Jun Dal.

613
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:36,530
Jun Dal.

614
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:40,492
Jun Dal.

615
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,411
Jun Dal.

616
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:07,686
I love you.

617
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:11,857
Okay.

618
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,361
That's not fair.

619
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:19,448
He contacted me out of the blue
when we were cleaning.

620
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,369
Then you should've told me
right after that

621
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:24,953
so that I could prepare myself mentally.

622
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:29,458
I was worried it might distract you
while you were studying.

623
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,044
We were able to study
for two full hours, you know.

624
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,339
You really are like the princess
in the story.

625
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:41,178
I'll go catch up with my dad first
and text you.

626
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:42,971
You can come in then. That's okay, right?

627
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,223
Yes.

628
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:50,354
Let's go.

629
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:01,532
Hello, I'm Choe Jun-u.

630
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:04,910
Hello, I'm Choe Jun-u.

631
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,085
How have you been, Soo-bin?

632
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:15,462
-Good.
-All the studying must be stressful.

633
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:18,882
It is. And Mom makes it
even more stressful.

634
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:20,843
Oh, dear.

635
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:23,595
Soo-bin.

636
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,056
I have to

637
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,142
tell you something today.

638
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:30,769
What is it?

639
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,483
Your mom and I...

640
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:40,154
are getting a divorce.

641
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:43,282
Dad...

642
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,872
I thought I should be honest with you.

643
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:56,545
I'm sure you already know

644
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:59,256
that your mom and I aren't on good terms.

645
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,845
Gosh.

646
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:09,766
I'm so ashamed
that I can't even look at you.

647
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:13,061
But you see,

648
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:16,773
I no longer want to pretend we get along.

649
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:20,611
I don't want to put on an act anymore.

650
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:24,072
That's why I've decided
to divorce your mom.

651
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:29,786
But she's against it because
she's worried that it may shock you.

652
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:32,998
Soo-bin.

653
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,293
You're not

654
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:39,755
a kid anymore.

655
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:41,423
You're 18.

656
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,927
I think you're old enough
to understand the situation.

657
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:46,553
I mean, you'll be an adult soon.

658
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,475
Right, Soo-bin?

659
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:55,187
What?

660
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:57,147
Aren't I right?

661
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:58,941
You understand everything, right?

662
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,071
It must be

663
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,823
so easy for you adults.

664
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:09,993
What?

665
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:12,704
Sometimes,

666
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:15,666
you tell us

667
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,585
that we know nothing
because we're too young

668
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,296
and that we should do nothing but study.

669
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,382
But other times, you say,

670
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,093
"You're all grown up now.

671
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,845
You're old enough
to understand everything."

672
00:47:29,846 --> 00:47:33,308
You change your words
whenever you want to suit your needs.

673
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,502
No, Soo-bin. Let me explain.

674
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:04,172
It's just that you've always been
so mature and thoughtful

675
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:07,134
since you were little, unlike other kids.

676
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,927
No, Dad.

677
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,263
I just

678
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:14,057
acted mature, that's all.

679
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,184
I had to react that way

680
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:19,021
to make it easier for you and Mom.

681
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:23,025
So that you'd feel less guilty.

682
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,112
But you know what?

683
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:30,490
To tell you the truth,

684
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:34,995
I didn't want to be like that.

685
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,390
You're back.

686
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:59,102
Let's go. My dad is busy today.

687
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:00,437
You can meet him another time.

688
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:04,441
Okay. Did the talk go well?

689
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:06,985
Yes.

690
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,281
You have a shift today, right?

691
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:19,498
But shall I just skip it
and hang out with you today?

692
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:26,004
No, you shouldn't miss your shift.

693
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:28,632
Just today. Let's hang out just today.

694
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:31,968
Come on. Please?

695
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:44,499
Jun-u.

696
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:46,877
Yes?

697
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:52,549
What is the one thing you regret
the most in your life?

698
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:59,181
I'm not sure. There are so many things.

699
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:01,892
Just one thing.

700
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:05,854
One thing that you've kept
bottled up inside your heart.

701
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:17,532
Not being able to tell him that it was me.

702
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:24,206
A while ago,

703
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:28,084
when I was about to transfer
from here to another school,

704
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,215
I went to my dad's house.

705
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:41,264
I always knew where he lived
but didn't have the courage to go there.

706
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,898
But I finally plucked up

707
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:53,860
my courage to go there to see him
since I was about to leave.

708
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,739
But my dad...

709
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:00,408
Don't you...

710
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:05,455
Don't you know me?

711
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:07,040
What?

712
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,334
He didn't recognize me.

713
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:15,715
That's what I regret the most.

714
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,348
Going to see him?

715
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,522
Not being able to say...

716
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:34,860
that I was Choe Jun-u

717
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:37,112
at that moment.

718
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:44,077
It felt like I had been erased

719
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,329
from his memory.

720
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:56,965
I regretted it all the time.

721
00:52:57,173 --> 00:52:59,134
But I couldn't go there again to tell him.

722
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:03,722
Let's go there again and tell him.

723
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:09,978
So you won't regret it anymore. Okay?

724
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,277
You want me to do that?

725
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:21,823
If it's something you regret.

726
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:29,664
Okay.

727
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:34,628
Can you take a look at this first?

728
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:38,423
You even drew a drawing?

729
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:41,927
Yes, just a little one.

730
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:44,387
That's good.

731
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:00,820
Let's go.

732
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:45,240
I hope all your regrets are gone now.

733
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:01,589
Do you feel better?

734
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:03,883
What?

735
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:07,262
Since I got rid of my regrets.

736
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:12,976
You had something you regretted,
so you were trying to feel better

737
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:14,269
by making me do this.

738
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:16,980
Did you know?

739
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:22,277
Something must've upset you
when you met your dad earlier.

740
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:30,285
You did this to make me feel better?

741
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,872
I was thinking of doing this
one day anyway.

742
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:36,666
I guess today is that day.

743
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:45,759
And I wanted to make you feel better
as well.

744
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:55,602
Aren't you hungry?

745
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:04,944
I'm having such a hard time
without you, Yeon-u.

746
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:06,654
I mean it.

747
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,532
You must miss your son.

748
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:11,451
I have no choice.

749
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:13,703
We've always lived like this.

750
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:19,959
I miss Jun-u, and you too.

751
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:24,380
Come if you miss me,
I'll treat you to something good.

752
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:28,927
Okay. Get back to work.

753
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:52,742
It's a railroad.

754
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:58,581
Isn't it beautiful?

755
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:02,836
It's like another world.

756
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,215
It is another world.

757
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:09,509
The world I live in.

758
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:12,387
I came here before.

759
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:13,805
What?

760
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:16,891
Last time, when I didn't trust you.

761
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:24,691
I wanted to come up here.

762
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,401
It's nice.

763
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:28,153
Is that your room?

764
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:29,779
Yes.

765
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,322
I want to see it.

766
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,074
No, wait.

767
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:35,952
You can see my room later.

768
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:38,413
It's a total mess.

769
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:44,794
Take a seat here.

770
00:57:58,933 --> 00:57:59,934
Here you go.

771
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:09,194
Thank you.

772
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:10,778
-Enjoy your meal.
-Enjoy your meal.

773
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:16,659
The thing I regret most right now

774
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:17,827
is when

775
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:21,664
my mom and dad said
they would get a divorce,

776
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,459
and I stopped them.

777
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,510
Mom, wait!

778
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:35,887
Mom, don't go.

779
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:37,931
Don't go. Don't go, Mom.

780
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,140
Mom.

781
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,184
You said you'd understand
even if we got divorced.

782
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:44,395
No. I can't understand.
I don't want you to split up.

783
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:46,064
Don't go, Mom.

784
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:49,108
Even if we get divorced,

785
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:50,944
your dad and I will still be friends,

786
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:55,532
and you'll be our daughter,
whom we love the most in this world.

787
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:58,952
No. Don't go, please.

788
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:01,037
Mom, I'll be a better daughter.

789
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,790
I'll study harder
and become a better daughter.

790
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:06,626
Dad promised me too.
He promised to change.

791
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,628
Mom, don't go.

792
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,715
Mom, please don't go.

793
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:15,134
Please stay.

794
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:20,473
Don't split up with Dad.

795
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:23,101
Don't cry.

796
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,436
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Soo-bin.

797
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,813
We won't split up.

798
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:30,066
I'm sorry, my daughter.

799
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,402
I'm sorry.

800
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:37,657
Back then, I thought
I was doing the right thing.

801
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:43,162
I didn't know they were just
living together because of me.

802
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:46,207
And I made them pretend

803
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,794
that they were happy and in love.

804
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:53,923
I found out later.

805
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:57,468
That what I did then was wrong.

806
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:03,141
But what can I do now?

807
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,271
I can't turn things back.

808
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:11,274
It's because of me.

809
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:23,119
It's not your fault.

810
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:27,790
You didn't know back then.

811
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:33,796
You thought that was for the best then.

812
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:38,885
Why didn't I know that back then?

813
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:44,557
I feel so bad...

814
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:48,936
for both Mom and Dad.

815
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:49,747
What are you guys doing?

816
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:07,807
So your girlfriend is Soo-bin?

817
01:02:10,935 --> 01:02:12,645
-Well...
-Mom.

818
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:16,607
I was going to tell you
after the final exams--

819
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:18,317
Soo-bin.

820
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:21,821
What is this now?

821
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:24,073
What is happening here?

822
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:26,242
What are you two doing?

823
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:27,994
Don't touch her!

824
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:30,413
What is this?

825
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:32,874
What on earth is happening?

826
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:36,043
What are you thinking?

827
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:03,738
Can I ask you something?

828
01:03:04,238 --> 01:03:05,281
That...

829
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:08,743
never happened.

830
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:11,537
I won't meet Soo-bin outside of school.

831
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:14,707
Even at school, I won't talk to her.

832
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:18,294
But please give her some freedom
in return.

833
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:19,212
Please.

834
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,172
This place is not a prison.

835
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:22,673
And I'm not a prison guard.

836
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:25,426
You suffocate them
and intrude into their lives.

837
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,887
You even censor and judge their emotions.

838
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:30,348
Soo-bin, let's get through this

839
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:31,849
even if it's hard.

840
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:34,435
At a time like this,
we should focus on our school life.

841
01:03:34,852 --> 01:03:36,020
That's what I'll do.

842
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:37,814
I hope you'll do the same.

843
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:38,898
I'm here for you.

844
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:40,942
I don't think
I can get the highest grades.

845
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:43,945
So I was wondering...
I'll need your help again.

846
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:45,488
I'm counting on you and Dad.

847
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:49,659
Could you please drive a little faster?

848
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:57,458
Hello, I'm Choe Jun-u.

849
