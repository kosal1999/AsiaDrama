1
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,252
What?

2
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:45,962
You bastard.

3
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,299
Did you just call me trash?

4
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:55,555
Yes. Since you're blaming me
for what you did.

5
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,225
Be honest...

6
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,144
and tell me what happened.

7
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,369
I'm sorry. I was a bit harsh.

8
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,246
I was just taken aback.

9
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,290
No one has ever misunderstood me
like this.

10
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,255
It's nothing.

11
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:42,977
That punk, Jun-u.
What's taking him so long?

12
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,646
I need to go home.

13
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,482
Jun-u,

14
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,609
you can be honest with me.

15
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,320
Actually, I knew.

16
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,493
Have you seen Mr. Son's watch here?

17
00:01:58,576 --> 00:01:59,911
He probably took it with him.

18
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,287
He didn't have it on.

19
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,706
Did you see him? You should've told me.

20
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,792
I just wanted to pull a prank on Mr. Son.

21
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,168
I was going to hide it.

22
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,298
It must be that guy.

23
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,633
The delivery guy.

24
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:14,717
I'm sure he stole it.

25
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,469
-No way.
-Trust me.

26
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,097
I saw him rummaging around
when he was cleaning up.

27
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,098
That thief.

28
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,100
Sang-hun, I'll go talk to him.

29
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,476
Let go. I'll go ask him.

30
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,727
I'll go see what's going on.

31
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,437
He's in my class.

32
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,984
Jun-u, just a second.

33
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,652
That's when I thought this.

34
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:37,198
"It already happened, so I shouldn't
let things get out of hand."

35
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,369
I thought I should find a way to help you.

36
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:46,166
You idiot. Did you really think
it'd still be there?

37
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,751
I'm sure he's already stashed it
in his pocket or underwear.

38
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,503
Jun-u would never do such a thing.

39
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,921
What are you talking about?

40
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,716
I heard he was forced to transfer
to our school because of theft.

41
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,175
Everyone knows.

42
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,637
I knew it. I knew he was up to something.

43
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,056
That's what Jo Sang-hun said.
And it looks like

44
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,350
he already told all the teachers about it,

45
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,811
along with the fact that I know as well.

46
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:09,772
Sang-hun, that jerk...

47
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,650
I'm sorry, Jun-u.

48
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,485
I didn't know it'd turn out like this.

49
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,577
But...

50
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,955
-seeing how you're suspecting me--
-"Suspecting"?

51
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:28,791
It's not just suspicion.

52
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,210
I saw it.

53
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,589
What on earth are you talking about?

54
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,093
I thought maybe you had your reasons.

55
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,475
And there must be a reason

56
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,977
that you're acting this way too.

57
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,524
Hey, Choe Jun-u!

58
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:56,778
Is that you, Jun-u?

59
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,322
You need to submit your apology letter.
Why didn't you come by?

60
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,866
And why aren't you picking up your phone?
Come on.

61
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,702
Hurry, get back here!

62
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,956
Are you going to tell Mr. Oh?

63
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,670
About what you're thinking.

64
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,342
I'm not sure.

65
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,952
LEE GI-TAE

66
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,039
Please leave a message after...

67
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,416
Why isn't he picking up?

68
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,382
Are you all right?

69
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,677
That must've hurt.

70
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,596
You didn't go to the academy?

71
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,557
How could I?

72
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,434
Knowing what you're going through.

73
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,733
LETTER OF APOLOGY

74
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,072
I thought about it,
but I did nothing to apologize for.

75
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,867
My goodness, you're...

76
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,370
I'm surprised.

77
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,040
You have a talent. You did
a great job of drawing this ladybug.

78
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,292
But we do need to submit
your letter of apology,

79
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,127
so please write another one.

80
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,254
If I submit this one,
I'll get in trouble. Here.

81
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,132
I really have nothing to write about.

82
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:45,428
Also, don't think about
transferring again just yet.

83
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:46,971
Hey, Jun-u.

84
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:50,850
As you know,
I'm just an assistant teacher.

85
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,311
If these big problems come up
while I'm filling in,

86
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:56,522
and a transfer student
gets transferred to another school,

87
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,776
and if the kids get even more
out of control as a result,

88
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,903
what do you think will happen to me?

89
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,031
Just try to think simply, sir.

90
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,201
A new kid is moving again
because of personal reasons.

91
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,913
No, I can't think like that.
The situation we're in is different.

92
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:15,500
Jun-u. First, the letter of apology...

93
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:20,838
Jun-u, you need to write something
instead of doodling.

94
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,340
Why did I get this?

95
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,425
Hey, write one as soon as--

96
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,594
Jun-u. Hey, Choe--

97
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,012
Gosh, this punk.

98
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:29,555
Choe Jun-u!

99
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,271
Jun-u! Wait.

100
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,817
Write a letter of apology. Please?

101
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:47,990
Come on. Get back here.

102
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,867
Hey, no! Wait!

103
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,788
God, it's so hot. My feet are killing me.

104
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,875
Good, you made a wise decision. Here.

105
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:04,006
Yes, great. Come here.

106
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,511
Good. Gosh, I can't wear these. Hey.

107
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,055
What's Oh thinking?
He's just an assistant teacher.

108
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,349
Hey, Choe Jun-u! Hey!

109
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:18,896
Sang-hun, do you know what happens when
you count on your brain and don't study?

110
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,314
You'll become stupid.

111
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:24,485
I'll still beat Hwi-yeong in math
even if that happens.

112
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,945
Hey, still...

113
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,655
Stop making fun of Hwi-yeong.

114
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,615
They were easy questions.

115
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,326
He shouldn't get those questions wrong.

116
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,168
Hwi-yeong.

117
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,379
Are you all right?

118
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,094
By the way, wasn't
what Hwi-yeong said earlier so cheesy?

119
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,307
"We shouldn't be biased against Jun-u.

120
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,059
We should trust Jun-u and be on his side."

121
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:01,647
Hey, Da-huin. Soo-bin will punch you
if you keep that up.

122
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,232
Why would I punch her?

123
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,026
I told you Hwi-yeong and I aren't dating.

124
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,611
We just went to the same kindergarten.

125
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:13,326
But I do agree
with what Hwi-yeong said earlier.

126
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:17,830
I think maybe we should've tried
to find a way

127
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,040
to help Jun-u.

128
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,374
Look up.

129
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,504
Why am I so pretty?

130
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,385
-Girls, look at Soo-bin.
-Why?

131
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,387
Wow, Soo-bin looks so pretty.

132
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,604
Wait, what time is it now?

133
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,984
Soo-bin, are you going to keep this up?

134
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,279
Do you know
how much the tutor charges per hour?

135
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:53,658
If you miss the session today,
we can't book that tutor again.

136
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,910
Soo-bin. Hey!

137
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,704
My mom is too much.

138
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,706
Is something going on?

139
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,626
Do you have a tutor now? A math tutor?

140
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,962
Who's this tutor? How much?

141
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,131
I really don't want to do it,
but my mom keeps...

142
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,552
Girls, I've got to run.

143
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,928
-Bye, see you tomorrow!
-What?

144
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,305
-Bye, Soo-bin.
-Bye.

145
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,807
Stop bumping into things!

146
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,975
What's this?

147
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,563
Getting good grades makes your life
so difficult, don't you think?

148
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,940
My mom's totally given up on me.

149
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,485
She'd be awfully grateful
if I didn't miss any classes.

150
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,488
I'll get going too.

151
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,907
Ro-mi, you don't have
any tutoring session today.

152
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,576
I'm going to a spa with my mom.

153
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:39,954
Bye.

154
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,041
Mom, please. I really don't want a tutor.

155
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,501
I'll study hard on my own. Please?

156
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,086
And what's the result?

157
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,880
Until when will your math grades
hover around Second Tier?

158
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,090
Mom, please.

159
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:55,011
If you keep this up, I'm going to
go talk with Hwi-yeong's mom.

160
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,846
I'll ask her to help you join
his math class.

161
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,265
No, please don't. I'll go. I'll go now.

162
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,516
Get there in ten minutes.

163
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,934
Don't even be a minute late.

164
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,894
How can I get there in ten minutes?

165
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,813
Why can't you?

166
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:08,107
That building is
right in front of your school.

167
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,609
Are you not at school now?

168
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,694
I am. I am at school.

169
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,779
I'm on my way. Okay, bye.

170
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,743
Gosh, I really hate this.

171
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,955
Everyone who studied with that tutor
got into Seoul National University.

172
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,751
Having a good career
is so important to her.

173
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,801
Oh, no! I'm in trouble.
I can't get there in ten minutes.

174
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,094
Darn it.

175
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:44,894
You again?

176
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,146
Yes, it's me again.

177
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,232
Oh, right! Hey, where are you going?

178
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,069
-I'm going to work.
-Where? Is it far?

179
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,033
It's right there.
Then let's turn this around.

180
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,913
I'm in a big rush now. Let me borrow this.

181
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,166
No, you can't. I live far from here.

182
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,210
I'll make sure to bring it back.
I'm sorry!

183
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,087
-I'm borrowing this!
-I have to go home later.

184
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,254
I live far from here.

185
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:13,839
Hey!

186
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,551
Sorry!

187
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,346
My place is really far from here.

188
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,143
Your mom said your goal is getting
into Seoul National University.

189
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,773
That is what my mom wants.

190
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:35,152
I don't care which school I go to.
I just want to choose the major.

191
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,155
Right. So you should study harder

192
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,449
and aim for SNU like your mom's hoping--

193
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:44,745
Well, I know that's not going to happen
even if I try my best.

194
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,540
I'm not that smart.

195
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:52,294
And I don't want to get stressed out
from such an unreasonable goal.

196
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:59,176
But I've already discussed this
with your mother.

197
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,178
Ma'am.

198
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,557
I heard all the students
that you've taught so far

199
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,267
entered Seoul National University.

200
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,602
I've heard a lot
about how amazing you are.

201
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,772
So I'm afraid

202
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:16,152
I might leave a stain on your reputation.

203
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:24,326
I'll talk to my mom and persuade her.

204
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,163
Thank you for your time today.

205
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,666
Yes! Soo-bin, you did a good job.

206
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,209
Has he already left?

207
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,843
Gosh, you startled me.

208
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,471
What are you doing here?

209
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,181
You were looking at something.

210
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:31,977
This.

211
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:33,938
Oh, my bike...

212
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:54,959
Thanks for the bike.

213
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:58,671
I was hanging out with my friends
after skipping the after-school study.

214
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:01,173
And I suddenly got a call from my mom

215
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,008
and had to be somewhere in a hurry.

216
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,094
Thanks for returning it.

217
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,221
Bye.

218
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,308
You didn't think I'd return it?

219
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:14,895
I was going to return it tomorrow
at school if not tonight.

220
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,943
I'm not coming tomorrow.

221
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,696
Didn't you say you're coming
to school until tomorrow?

222
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,948
Well, I decided not to come.

223
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:29,827
Right.

224
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,269
Is this what you call research?

225
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,107
I did my best.

226
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,109
A reference list needs more

227
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,695
than just book titles and author names.

228
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,157
I wrote down the publishers too.

229
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,076
You have to specify

230
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,038
where exactly each quote is from.

231
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,497
Haven't you done this before?

232
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,376
Anyway,

233
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,797
do it again by tomorrow.

234
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,427
I told you, I'm not coming tomorrow.

235
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,012
That's your problem.

236
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,015
Shouldn't you do your duty
before you leave?

237
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,810
Just like I came here to return your bike.

238
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:41,315
Don't tell me you're disappearing
after putting our group in trouble.

239
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,691
That'd be so irresponsible.

240
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,028
You heard that I'm the queen
of performance assessments, right?

241
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:50,115
Now that I've accepted you into our group,

242
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,451
shouldn't you at least show some--

243
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:05,965
Here.

244
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,217
Eyes.

245
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,970
Do you have something in your eyes?

246
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,054
Let me see.

247
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,811
Let me take a look.

248
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,105
No. Not mine.

249
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:29,905
Here.

250
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:36,328
Gosh, why didn't he tell me earlier?

251
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,928
Hey, I want to ask you something.

252
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:56,849
Well...

253
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,226
A pack of One Day, please.

254
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,607
I'll get going.

255
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,444
Thanks for your bike.

256
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,321
What is it? What do you want to ask me?

257
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:16,827
Well...

258
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,372
Did you really...

259
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,875
steal that academy teacher's watch?

260
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,300
I guess you didn't.

261
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,385
Bye.

262
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:34,928
Why?

263
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,391
Why do you think I didn't steal it?

264
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,942
I thought maybe you had your reasons.

265
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,572
And there must be a reason
that you're acting this way too.

266
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,244
Hwi-yeong is studying.

267
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,211
Father, you're home.

268
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,463
What were you doing?

269
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,382
-Pardon?
-Why are you standing so awkwardly?

270
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,805
Is it still so hard to stay in your seat?

271
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,099
No. I was looking for a workbook.

272
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,475
Are your mock exam results out yet?

273
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,854
-I'm getting them tomorrow.
-He did a good job again.

274
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,274
What was his name?
That son of Mr. Jo at my company.

275
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,360
Jo Sang-hun. In Class One.

276
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,780
Yes, Jo Sang-hun. That smart kid.

277
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,451
Beware of kids like him.

278
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,620
Kids who have nothing
but their good brains.

279
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,455
They're the scariest.

280
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,332
I'm one of them.

281
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,960
I had nothing but my brain to rely on

282
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,129
while struggling to climb this high.

283
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,798
I don't ask for much.

284
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,883
Just do as well as your big brother, okay?

285
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:56,677
Okay.

286
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,082
Open the door.

287
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,918
Open the door. Open it!

288
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,670
Open it right now!

289
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,255
Hey!

290
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,472
You know how hard it was
to make an appointment with the teacher.

291
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,057
You do know, don't you?

292
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,351
How could you do that?

293
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,896
I don't feel comfortable
with one-on-one tutoring.

294
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,397
What did you...

295
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,442
Does it even matter
if you feel comfortable right now?

296
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,152
Think of your grades.

297
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,321
What's so wrong with my grades?

298
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,990
I came 28th in my year. Is it that bad?

299
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,910
Other kids with my grades
would have been complimented

300
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,703
and become their parents' pride.

301
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,538
Are you like other kids?

302
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,999
Is it okay for you to enter
just any university in Seoul

303
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,542
like those kids?

304
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:16,131
Soo-bin, do you have any idea
what a difficult place

305
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,008
this society is for women?

306
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,762
Do you think you can stand
at the same starting line as men? No way.

307
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,306
That's why,
from your family, parents, wealth,

308
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,682
and education to looks,

309
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,893
all those things count
as your weapon and asset.

310
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,728
You have everything.
What do you lack, really?

311
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,188
Tell me what it is that you lack.

312
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,065
All you have to do now is study.

313
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:35,943
Work hard for two years
and enter Seoul National University,

314
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,570
and you can do whatever you want.
I'll leave you alone.

315
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,490
What's the problem?
Have I ever asked you for anything else?

316
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,991
All I ask of you is to study.

317
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,244
How hard can that be?
Am I asking you to make money?

318
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,288
Women can't live like men in this society!

319
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,331
Soo-bin!

320
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,917
We have to work a hundred times harder!

321
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,129
Do you have anything to say?

322
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,715
I'll study harder.

323
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,343
Go study.

324
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,641
-When is Dad coming home?
-Why? What about him?

325
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:10,644
You call him every day. Why are you asking
me? Maybe when this semester is over.

326
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,562
Do you think you can study less
if he's home?

327
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,022
Don't be ridiculous.

328
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,575
Don't take too long in the shower.
It'll make you drowsy.

329
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,160
I'll be checking on you at 1 a.m.

330
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,453
Okay.

331
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:50,767
Here.

332
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,190
So what?

333
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,486
Thanks for returning it.

334
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:03,697
Bye.

335
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,993
What's so precious about that bike?

336
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,662
It was a piece of junk.

337
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:42,152
REFERENCE LIST, REORGANIZE LIKE THIS!

338
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,739
She has nice handwriting.

339
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:47,949
Why do you think I didn't steal it?

340
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,788
For two reasons.

341
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:56,291
First of all, you seem a bit

342
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:00,504
too slow to steal something from others.

343
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:06,343
More importantly, I think you'll
find stealing itself so bothersome.

344
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,307
Did you almost smile again?

345
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,968
What was your name again?

346
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,433
Gosh, should I go to school tomorrow?

347
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,146
I really don't want to.

348
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:03,108
CHOE JUN-U

349
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,994
I really don't want to go.

350
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,790
I really, really don't want to go.

351
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,681
THE NAKED TREE

352
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,944
Hurry up, Jeong-hu!

353
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:50,322
My mom isn't home today!

354
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:52,824
Jun-u, wait for me!

355
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:41,665
CHEONBONG LIBRARY

356
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,135
Jun-u.

357
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,055
You're here early.

358
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:58,723
I have something to do.

359
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,226
-What is it?
-Some research.

360
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,686
For the performance assessment.

361
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,855
What for? You're leaving tomorrow.

362
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,567
I might not go tomorrow.

363
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,279
Then when?

364
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,157
I'm not sure.

365
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,784
This bastard is toying with me.

366
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:21,705
I see.

367
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,333
Hwi-yeong.

368
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,168
What?

369
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,381
-Don't worry.
-About what?

370
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:33,883
I won't tell anyone.

371
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:44,978
Hey, Jun-u.

372
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:46,938
You're here early.

373
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:48,481
Good morning, Hwi-yeong.

374
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,275
I have to check for tardy students today.

375
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:51,943
-Take care of the class for me.
-Okay.

376
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,737
Jun-u, don't you have something
to say to me?

377
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,740
You little punk. How could you
just run away like that yesterday?

378
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,742
Hwi-yeong, you can go. And you follow me.

379
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,994
-Over there.
-What?

380
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,704
-It's the vice-principal.
-What?

381
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,123
Hey, Jun--

382
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,125
See you later.

383
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,681
Your payment has been settled.

384
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:22,849
Thank you.

385
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:27,687
Hey.

386
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,523
Near the school.

387
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:33,485
Now?

388
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,821
No, okay. I'll be there right away.

389
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,239
Okay.

390
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,743
Gi-tae.

391
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,495
-So-ye.
-What are you doing?

392
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:46,331
I was getting a book rebound.

393
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,751
Sorry, but something came up,
so I have to go.

394
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,796
-I'm sorry.
-What is it?

395
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:56,674
Hwi-yeong?

396
00:27:56,758 --> 00:28:01,763
PHILOSOPHY, LITERATURE, LINGUISTICS

397
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:08,853
LETTER OF APOLOGY

398
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,074
LETTER OF APOLOGY

399
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,997
Could you write this first

400
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:29,666
before you study?

401
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:46,099
And during this important era

402
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:48,143
appears a great figure.

403
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,895
Let's finish this part next time.

404
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:52,772
-Okay.
-Thank you.

405
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,108
-Thank you, teacher.
-Have a good day.

406
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,947
I'm so hungry.

407
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,323
Why don't you go eat some grass?

408
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,284
Like a goat.

409
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,287
-Do you want some?
-No.

410
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,289
Da-huin is stressed out lately.

411
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,582
She gained 500 grams.

412
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:14,377
Goodness, Da-huin.
Why are you living like that?

413
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,588
What's so important about
looking pretty to others?

414
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,215
It's not just anyone. It's O-je.

415
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,012
O-je's ideal type is
extremely skinny girls.

416
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,312
O-je, do you...

417
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,607
No. Don't say anything.

418
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:36,858
Soo-bin, what?

419
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,527
Oh, it's nothing.

420
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,741
He's so good-looking.

421
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,701
What are you looking at this time?

422
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,873
-The newbie isn't coming.
-Choe Jun-u?

423
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,126
What if he got arrested or something?

424
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,296
He said he was transferring.
I guess he already left.

425
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,174
He's really a man of his word.

426
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,717
He kept his promise.

427
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:06,304
Shouldn't you do your duty
before you leave?

428
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,227
Hwi-yeong.

429
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,147
Hwi-yeong.

430
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,733
Yes, Chan-yeol. What?

431
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,361
Did the newbie really leave?
Is he not coming?

432
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,240
Jun-u?

433
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,325
I don't know.

434
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:32,831
He should've at least told us
that he was really leaving.

435
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,727
Choe Jun-u, that loser.

436
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,063
I thought he understood me.

437
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,481
He really didn't come.

438
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:58,458
You came.

439
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,504
Oh, right. About the list of references...

440
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,716
THE NAKED TREE

441
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,928
I checked all the cited parts,

442
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:13,556
but I couldn't for the life of me
find some of them.

443
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:23,942
My gosh! Choe Jun-u, this rat.

444
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,568
Move. Let me see.

445
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:30,907
Goodness.
The newbie was a thief after all.

446
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,368
Wow, I'm impressed.

447
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,787
Oh, my. The newbie's got some nerve.

448
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,377
My gosh, you dirty thief.

449
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,836
You're really something.

450
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,880
Hey, where's my watch?

451
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,590
Oh, here it is.

452
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,677
Jun-u, didn't you transfer
to another school?

453
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,305
I thought you did.

454
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,225
Gi-tae, what's going on?

455
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,270
We opened Jun-u's locker thinking he had--

456
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:05,274
I asked him if I could use this locker
because the corner one is uncomfortable.

457
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,401
But we found...

458
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,280
Gosh, how much would this cost?

459
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,033
You didn't have to open it
in front of everyone.

460
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,285
I didn't expect to find this
in his locker.

461
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,041
How did you know I wouldn't be here today?

462
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,378
-What?
-I...

463
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,840
only told Soo-bin.

464
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,092
I didn't tell anyone.

465
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,470
You guys were told
that today would be my last day.

466
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,475
We didn't see you in the morning,
so we thought...

467
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,273
Gi-tae, you were misinformed.

468
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,025
Jun-u's leaving tomorrow.

469
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,403
I see. I guess I was confused.

470
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:55,283
-Guys.
-Let's go. They're coming.

471
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,138
My goodness.

472
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,808
You've already decided
to leave our school,

473
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,144
so I don't even know
how we should handle this.

474
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,563
In any case,

475
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:29,442
Mr. Oh, handle it well
so it doesn't get out of control.

476
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:31,486
-As for our students,
-Yes, sir.

477
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,488
make sure they don't spread any rumors.

478
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:34,572
-Sir.
-Understood, sir.

479
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,574
Yes? Hi, Hwi-yeong.

480
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,369
I just spoke with Mr. Son on the phone.

481
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,581
He said he'll just let it go.

482
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:44,916
-Really?
-Seriously?

483
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:48,002
Yes. And he asked me
to bring the watch to him.

484
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,507
Hwi-yeong,

485
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,425
you're such a skillful negotiator!

486
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,427
Oh, my. He should become a diplomat.

487
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,471
Yes, you're right.
That'd be perfect for him.

488
00:34:58,971 --> 00:34:59,806
Jun-u.

489
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,225
It's all sorted out now, so don't worry.

490
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:05,520
Hwi-yeong never lets us down.
He's the pride of our school.

491
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,608
What's been sorted out?

492
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:15,321
We haven't even figured out
who put it in my locker.

493
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:19,158
Goodness, Mr. Son said
he'd kindly forgive you.

494
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,743
He doesn't need to forgive me.

495
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,036
Jun-u, what are you doing?

496
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,496
I've done nothing...

497
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,790
to be forgiven for.

498
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,333
What...

499
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,210
My goodness.

500
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:44,725
Ma Hwi-yeong.

501
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,065
Did you really have to do this?

502
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,610
-What?
-I'm leaving this school anyway.

503
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,488
You could've just let me go quietly. Why?

504
00:35:58,447 --> 00:35:59,699
What are you talking about?

505
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,492
You're out of line.

506
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,788
I think I've done my best to help you.

507
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:11,043
Right, there's nothing to expect

508
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:12,920
from people like you, right?

509
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:22,972
Today, we'll be learning
about the coastlines of Korea.

510
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,141
As you guys already know,

511
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:28,060
each of the three coastlines
has different characteristics.

512
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,146
First of all,
what's the eastern coastline like?

513
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,398
It's relatively simple, right?

514
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,817
Then what about
the western and southern coastlines?

515
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:37,153
They're complicated. Very complicated.

516
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,864
Why? Because all the mountain ranges
point toward...

517
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,424
Next, you can see it here.

518
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,301
Ma'am, I have a question.

519
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,928
Yes. What is it, Hwi-yeong?

520
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,596
From the last assignment...

521
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,014
The last assignment?

522
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,016
The one about volcanoes?

523
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,228
In the case of basaltic lava,

524
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,813
it has low viscosity,
which means it's more fluid.

525
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,024
Therefore, basaltic volcanoes
have gentle slopes.

526
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,734
Okay?

527
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,278
Great. Now, let's take a look
at the questions below.

528
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,833
-Go!
-You got this!

529
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,252
-You can do it!
-Faster!

530
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,379
-You got this!
-Run faster!

531
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:37,630
Where's Jo Sang-hun?

532
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,382
Sang-hun? He's over there.

533
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,300
Sang-hun! Jo Sang-hun!

534
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,262
-Go, team!
-Faster!

535
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,558
-Jo Sang-hun.
-What are you doing here?

536
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,477
-Did you really see it?
-See what?

537
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,937
Me stealing the watch.

538
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,772
-What?
-Did you see it?

539
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,943
-Go!
-Go for it!

540
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,528
All right. Now, let's learn

541
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,489
-about Ulleungdo and Dokdo.
-Hey!

542
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,449
-You, over there!
-Ulleungdo is...

543
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,994
-It's the newbie.
-The lava from...

544
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,579
Guys, what are you doing?

545
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,708
Hey, isn't the one
in the white T-shirt Jo Sang-hun?

546
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,084
And isn't that the newbie?

547
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,752
-The newbie?
-It's the newbie.

548
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,671
Guys, go back to your seats!

549
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,633
-Go!
-Go for it!

550
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,761
Hey, Sang-hun runs super fast, right?

551
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:28,222
He was the fastest one
in my middle school.

552
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,348
Right? He's super fast.

553
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,599
Hey, look at that.

554
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,601
-What's with them?
-Should I get the baton?

555
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,270
Hey, stop. Hey!

556
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:35,479
-Hey, Sang-hun!
-Hey!

557
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,898
You need to pass the baton to me!

558
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:49,827
Guys!

559
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,009
Stop chasing me! I'm exhausted.

560
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,556
I asked you if you saw me
stealing the watch.

561
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,976
How fast can you run?

562
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,020
Hey, what are they doing?

563
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,688
The PE teacher is watching.
Get back inside.

564
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,482
I think they're fighting.

565
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,233
What are they talking about?

566
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,777
-Hey!
-Ma'am.

567
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,820
I think they're fighting.
I should go stop them.

568
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,655
No, you shouldn't. Go back to your seat.

569
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,200
-It's dangerous.
-Guys, go back to your seats.

570
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,160
Hey, Pil-sang and Dong.

571
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,247
Did you see me doing it?

572
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,709
Is that what Hwi-yeong told you?

573
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:40,461
Yes.

574
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,798
Hwi-yeong, that jerk...

575
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:45,925
Hey, Choe Jun-u!

576
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:48,052
Get me a popsicle on your way back!

577
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,553
I want a popsicle!

578
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,514
What are they doing?

579
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,641
-We're not sure.
-Guys! What are you doing?

580
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,977
My gosh, the PE teacher.
The PE teacher saw us.

581
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,606
All right, guys.
Let's get back to where we were.

582
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:01,816
What do we do about them?

583
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,275
Where were we?

584
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,568
I'm sorry, ma'am.

585
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:07,613
It's okay, Hwi-yeong.
All right, next page.

586
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,449
In winter,
the cold air mass from Siberia...

587
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,619
Come here.

588
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:15,204
Hey!

589
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,044
Gosh, I'm so forgetful.

590
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,248
Hwi-yeong.

591
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:02,126
That newbie is quite something.
He's super fast.

592
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,044
What did he say?

593
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,217
Did you tell him that I saw it?

594
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,304
Yes.

595
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:16,140
Interesting.

596
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:21,103
Why are you here?
I can't play with you anymore.

597
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,897
My legs are killing me because of you.

598
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,657
Don't you remember what I said?

599
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,327
What do you mean?

600
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,382
I saw it too.

601
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:54,929
Are you happy now, newbie?

602
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:07,775
Didn't I do a good job?

603
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:15,616
Here I go. Gosh.

604
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,372
Are you leaving?
You haven't changed your mind?

605
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:23,499
Yes.

606
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,588
You were running around the field
so fast earlier. What was that?

607
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:30,881
You were going to leave anyway.

608
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,220
I was curious

609
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,138
why they did that.

610
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,599
Saying they saw something they didn't.

611
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,060
Saying they didn't do something they did.

612
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:47,648
Is that it? You were curious?

613
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,454
Curious, my foot.

614
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,832
You were angry.

615
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:08,335
All the treading made you turn.
Am I wrong?

616
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:12,756
You're running away right now.

617
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:17,886
Fine, walk away trying to look
all cool. But you don't!

618
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:19,763
Hey!

619
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,391
Jun-u!

620
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,310
You're only running away!

621
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,198
I'm in front of the school gate. Come out.

622
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:41,577
Soo-bin!

623
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,205
-What's going on?
-Let's go.

624
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,999
-Where are we going?
-Let's go!

625
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:48,584
Did you find another tutor?

626
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,003
Another one already?

627
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:58,719
Why are we at Hwi-yeong's house?

628
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,888
Soo-bin, carry this.

629
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,932
God, what is all this?

630
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:10,564
-What are we doing right now?
-Just follow me.

631
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:16,820
Who is it?

632
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,490
Hello, I'm here to see Ms. Park.

633
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,286
-"Ms. Park"?
-Stay, or you get no allowance.

634
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,956
Pick it up. Right now.

635
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,339
Sorry for making you wait.

636
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:38,676
Why do you bring so much every time?

637
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,177
-Come on in.
-Okay.

638
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,265
-Have a seat.
-All right.

639
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,313
I was talking to my eldest son
on the phone.

640
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,982
-He's in the US, remember?
-Of course.

641
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:56,276
I'm sorry for showing up so suddenly.

642
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,612
Don't worry. I understand.

643
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:01,240
You must feel anxious

644
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:02,950
with the midterm coming up.

645
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:06,203
By the way, Soo-bin,
you've become so much prettier.

646
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,832
I'm worried.
When the girls become prettier,

647
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,917
the boys can't focus on their studies.

648
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,171
Thank you.

649
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:22,052
So, Soo-bin wants to be
in Mr. Son's class?

650
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,513
Yes.

651
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:27,099
No matter how hard I look,

652
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:29,810
I can't seem to find
a better math teacher than him.

653
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:30,894
That's true.

654
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:34,898
I talked to Mr. Son,
and he said we need your permission.

655
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,776
My goodness. He's exaggerating.

656
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:41,655
Why would you need my permission?
If she's good enough, she can join.

657
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:45,409
You're aware that you need
to pass the level test, right?

658
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:46,577
Of course.

659
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:48,454
I...

660
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,749
-Even after that...
-Even after that?

661
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,877
Without your permission,

662
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:58,005
Mr. Son won't accept her. We know that.

663
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,882
Please think about it.

664
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,259
Let me talk to Mr. Son.

665
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,887
-Thank you. I appreciate it.
-I'm home.

666
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:06,638
Hi, my son.

667
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,599
Soo-bin and her mom are here.

668
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:10,976
-How have you been?
-Hi, Hwi-yeong.

669
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:12,895
You've become so handsome.

670
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:16,231
Your son is perfect.

671
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:19,234
No way. He has a long way to go.

672
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,613
I love your dress.

673
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,823
I bought it recently...

674
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:44,635
What a bitch.

675
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:47,596
She thinks she's the queen.

676
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,474
She's nothing
without her husband and sons.

677
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:51,725
How obnoxious.

678
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:52,976
If we had met 20 years ago,

679
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,770
she wouldn't have even dared
to talk to me.

680
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:58,148
She graduated from a university
no one has heard of.

681
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,698
I'm sorry I didn't tell you beforehand.

682
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:10,536
Hey, humiliation doesn't last long.

683
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,373
I had no choice.

684
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,251
Without some special measures,

685
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,169
-you would have--
-I'm sorry, Mom.

686
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:21,463
What?

687
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:25,050
I'm sorry I'm not a top student
like Hwi-yeong.

688
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:27,678
I made you beg that lady.

689
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:41,608
Hwi-yeong.

690
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,329
I'm glad you're here.

691
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,541
You'll probably never see Mr. Son again
after this.

692
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,835
But still, you should settle it.

693
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:07,342
The thing you said earlier...

694
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:12,431
"People like you."

695
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:16,852
What did you mean

696
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,563
by that?

697
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:21,565
That?

698
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,401
Well...

699
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:29,740
Which school are you transferring to?

700
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,911
I'm moving to Onyang. My mom works there.

701
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:38,665
"People like you."

702
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:44,296
People like you are nothing special.

703
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:47,424
You are living and breathing,

704
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:51,011
but even if you keep on living like this,

705
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,013
you have no hope.

706
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:58,060
You're okay no matter
how badly other people treat you.

707
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,814
You just live.

708
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:06,276
Just because you were born
even if no one welcomed you.

709
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:09,196
Just because you still are alive.

710
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:12,115
Just because you don't even have
the guts to disappear.

711
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,078
I pity

712
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,455
people like you.

713
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:30,801
What about you?

714
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:35,222
Don't you pity yourself?

715
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:43,980
Why would I?

716
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:45,899
I'm different from you.

717
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:48,443
Go now.

718
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,075
You asked one more thing.

719
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,870
Why did I have to do that to you

720
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:01,998
when you were leaving anyway?

721
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:07,462
Because you were out of line.

722
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:12,968
You started to raise doubts about me
instead of getting lost quietly.

723
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,302
How dare you do that...

724
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:17,472
to me.

725
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:21,435
Does that answer your questions?

726
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,395
All of them?

727
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,938
-Yes, Mom.
-Did you pack up your things?

728
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:08,815
You should pack lightly for now.

729
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,359
I'll go over there on Sunday
and get the rest of your stuff.

730
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:14,696
I visited the school
you'll be going to this afternoon,

731
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,198
and it seemed really nice.

732
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,951
Just forget everything,
and when you come here,

733
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:22,496
you should just focus
on your studies, okay?

734
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:25,081
You have to go to a nice university
and succeed

735
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,918
so that you can be a proud son
when you meet your dad later.

736
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:32,464
Dad?

737
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:35,675
Where does he live?

738
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:37,844
Do you even keep in touch with him?

739
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,682
Of course, I keep in touch with him.

740
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,601
Didn't I tell you?

741
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:47,979
He lives in Pohang or something
because of his work.

742
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:51,483
Do you know how much he worries about you?

743
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:52,859
Mom.

744
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:54,861
I have to go.

745
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:56,696
I'm on my way home.

746
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:58,532
Jun-u--

747
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:25,350
Mom, you think I don't know
where he lives, don't you?

748
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,200
I know

749
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:44,286
where his house is.

750
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:50,876
Now that I'm leaving soon,
I think I have the courage.

751
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:54,296
The courage to see him once
before leaving.

752
00:52:57,382 --> 00:53:01,261
The man who brought me into this world
without any blessing.

753
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:03,763
Choe Myeong-jun.

754
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:09,311
Who is it?

755
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,239
-Excuse me...
-We're not done

756
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:22,699
with our noodles yet.

757
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:25,160
Tell him we'll put out the bowls
in 30 minutes.

758
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:27,746
We'll put out the bowls in 30 minutes.

759
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:44,971
Can I help you?

760
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:56,399
Don't you...

761
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:03,615
Don't you know me?

762
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:06,076
What?

763
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,829
I think you came to the wrong house.

764
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:16,044
-Daddy!
-Did you have fun today?

765
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,270
I want this.

766
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:19,816
By any chance,
are you Mr. Choe Myeong-jun?

767
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:21,609
No, I'm not.

768
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,194
Okay.

769
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:32,912
By any chance,
are you Mr. Choe Myeong-jun?

770
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:35,707
Choe Myeong-jun? No.

771
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,719
I thought I had finally found you.

772
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:58,188
I always thought about
what I should say if I meet you.

773
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,316
But...

774
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:03,002
-Yes.
-Hey.

775
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,046
I was wondering if you got home safely.

776
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:06,339
I did.

777
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:09,300
I'm packing right now.

778
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:10,927
Jun-u.

779
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,346
I'm sorry about earlier.

780
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,181
I just meant...

781
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:16,850
Don't worry about it.

782
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,395
I'll try harder from now on.

783
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:22,772
No, there's no need. When you come here,

784
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,649
you don't have to try so hard.

785
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:27,777
I'm just happy as long as you're with me.

786
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,989
The ladies in this town are
looking forward

787
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:33,199
to meeting my handsome son.

788
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,827
Do you know my friend Hye-yeong?
She even made

789
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:38,121
radish kimchi to give you when you arrive.

790
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:40,665
Also, do you remember Seon-mi? She--

791
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:41,875
I'm sorry, Mom.

792
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:44,586
What?

793
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:48,465
For getting in trouble again.

794
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:56,014
I wanted to do better this time.

795
00:57:58,057 --> 00:58:00,685
What are you talking about?
It's not your fault.

796
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,730
It's because of those mean jerks.

797
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:08,318
They think you're a pushover
since you don't live with me.

798
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:12,822
Who can I blame?

799
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,033
It's all my fault.

800
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:18,786
I should've always stayed
right by your side.

801
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:22,499
But I have no choice
because of that darned money...

802
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,167
Mom.

803
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,586
Are you crying again?

804
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:30,632
No. Why would I cry?
Crying means that I've lost.

805
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:35,887
Don't let it get you down.

806
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:39,224
You're not running away
from that place, okay?

807
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:41,392
You're coming here since I'm living here.

808
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:42,977
To be with me.

809
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:48,358
Let's live happily here, Jun-u.

810
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:49,776
I am...

811
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:52,946
I'm truly happy right now.

812
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,822
Since I can live with my son.

813
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:59,410
I can make breakfast for you every day now

814
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:02,914
and even iron your school uniform for you.

815
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:07,168
I feel so happy.

816
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:08,795
Okay.

817
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:12,882
Good night.

818
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:15,885
Okay.

819
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,465
You're running away right now.

820
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:58,094
Fine, walk away trying to look
all cool. But you don't!

821
00:59:58,177 --> 00:59:59,971
You're only running away!

822
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:02,140
I'm running away.

823
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:05,893
Why do I keep running away?

824
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:09,105
Why must I keep running away?

825
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:13,067
Because I don't care
however my life turns out?

826
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:15,111
I pity

827
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:16,946
people like you.

828
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:20,491
"People like me"?

829
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,505
I'm sorry, Jun-u.

830
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:37,550
Because of me... It's all my fault.

831
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:40,928
I'm sorry, my son.

832
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:10,249
Don't cry, Mom. I can see you crying.

833
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:20,426
I'm not crying.

834
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,928
I'm already in bed.

835
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:29,018
My mom is still young and immature.

836
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:33,064
But she didn't run away from me

837
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:35,441
even back when she was much younger.

838
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,320
She didn't run away.

839
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:01,008
THE MIDTERM
D-19

840
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:05,763
Guys, I have great news.

841
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:08,975
On the mock exam, Hwi-yeong...

842
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:11,436
ranked in the First Tier...

843
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:15,064
on every subject.

844
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:17,608
-Awesome!
-Amazing!

845
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:18,985
-We're proud of you.
-Nice!

846
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:22,155
-We're proud of you!
-Ma Hwi-yeong!

847
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:24,365
-Ma Hwi-yeong!
-How does he get such good grades?

848
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:25,575
I know, right?

849
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:27,243
-That's amazing!
-All right.

850
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:28,953
-Hwi-yeong.
-Ma Hwi-yeong.

851
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:30,913
-Well done!
-You should say a few words.

852
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:36,669
-Thank you, Mr. Oh.
-Don't mention it.

853
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:39,630
Thanks, guys.

854
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:43,676
I think I got good grades by luck
this time, so I'll study harder.

855
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:46,012
Let's all do better next time.

856
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:48,055
All right. Give him a big hand!

857
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:51,184
You're so cool!

858
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:54,729
You're cool!

859
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:47,824
Hwi-yeong, don't mess with me.

860
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:50,201
You'll converse freely in pairs
for three minutes.

861
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:52,912
The study leader will
randomly pick your partner.

862
01:03:53,037 --> 01:03:54,121
That was a good call too.

863
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:56,457
Not running away. Good.

864
01:03:56,541 --> 01:04:00,169
If you face any problems,
you can talk to me openly about them.

865
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:02,463
-Yes, sir.
-That sounded so insincere.

866
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:05,049
If her performance assessment
and English exams are ruined...

867
01:04:05,299 --> 01:04:07,718
I don't think it's something
you can sort out.

868
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:09,720
For Soo-bin, not for you.

869
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:11,138
Why are you concerned about me?

870
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:13,474
Because I was forced to transfer here
and seem like a loser?

871
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:16,185
Right, it's just how Jun-u is.

872
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:28,239
