1
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:45,670
Jun-u.

2
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,047
You little punk.

3
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,008
I thought you were the vice-principal!

4
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,634
The back door was hard to open.

5
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,095
Didn't he transfer to another school?

6
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,141
You little rascal.

7
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,184
STUDENT GRADE REPORT

8
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,727
Is this how...

9
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,479
Why did you pretend you were leaving?

10
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,105
Come here. I'm glad you're back.

11
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,940
Welcome back.

12
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,904
Come over here. How could you fool me?

13
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:15,158
Let's give a big hand
to Choe Jun-u, who has returned!

14
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,328
Welcome back, Jun-u.

15
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:24,542
You said you were leaving. Were you lying?

16
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:27,629
You know, it's not cool to run away.

17
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,925
Jun-u, you can go sit in that empty seat.

18
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,013
Here you go, Hwi-yeong.

19
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:38,473
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

20
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,004
CHOE JUN-U

21
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,929
Mom, I really don't want to go.

22
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:21,432
Then you should've gotten
top-tier grades in the first place.

23
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:24,936
Consider yourself lucky to be
taking Mr. Son's level test.

24
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,230
It's because of all your kissing up
that day.

25
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,315
You even brought Hwi-yeong's mom flowers.

26
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:33,111
What's wrong with kissing up?
I can do worse than that.

27
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,863
As long as my daughter goes to SNU.

28
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,866
You better pass the level test. Got it?

29
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,701
You can do it.

30
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,669
You can do it. You're my daughter, right?

31
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,838
"I'll make it to
Seoul National University." Say it.

32
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:57,552
Yoo Soo-bin! You can do it, Yoo Soo-bin!

33
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,776
HEY, JEONG-HU. HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

34
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,043
CONGRATULATIONS
MOST IMPROVED SCHOOL

35
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,764
Was it that bad?

36
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,351
Running away.

37
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,481
Is that funny?

38
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,776
Of course it's funny.
It didn't sound like you at all.

39
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,112
I'm glad you found it funny.

40
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,406
Everyone says I'm boring.

41
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,741
I guess I've improved.

42
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:05,370
Hwi-yeong, don't mess with me.

43
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:06,412
What?

44
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,959
As long as you leave me alone,
I won't do anything.

45
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,335
It's too bothersome.

46
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:18,841
"Don't mess with me"?

47
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,469
You bastard.

48
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:23,972
What are you guys doing?

49
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,017
Soo-bin.

50
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,687
-What about the literature--
-Jun-u.

51
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,773
The research on the list of references
that you did, it was good.

52
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,485
We finished the assignment, thanks to you.

53
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,779
You just submitted the assignment?

54
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:42,949
I was going to look it over for you.
I even found some papers for reference.

55
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:46,369
Oh, really? You should've told me.
That's too bad.

56
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:47,412
Thanks.

57
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,582
Next time, tell me before you submit it.

58
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,792
I'll review it for you.

59
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,045
-Let's go.
-You can go first.

60
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,255
I need to go to Class Five.

61
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,529
Why are you so surprised?

62
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,699
By the way, that was a good call too.

63
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,492
Not running away.

64
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,623
CHOE JUN-U

65
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,083
Very

66
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:35,626
good.

67
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,051
Did you look into it?

68
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,135
Yes.

69
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,180
It seems like Jun-u's transfer
was conditional.

70
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,306
When he came here.

71
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,683
To leave if he gets involved
in another incident.

72
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,435
Really?

73
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,189
Then he'll have to leave
if something bad happens again.

74
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,524
-How?
-You should come up with that.

75
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,817
As soon as possible.

76
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,986
Hwi-yeong.

77
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,322
Why are you trying to chase Jun-u away?

78
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,365
He won't be a problem
even if you leave him alone.

79
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,784
He just gets in the way.

80
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:09,952
All the time.

81
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,954
That doesn't mean it's okay to lie.

82
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,500
"Piece of trash"?
Shouldn't you call yourself that?

83
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,126
He's annoying.

84
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:38,481
The number you have dialed
is not available at the moment.

85
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,149
Please leave a message after the beep.

86
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,987
Jeong-hu, why aren't you
answering the phone?

87
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,489
Is something wrong?

88
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,032
Do you still hang out with--

89
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,160
Hey, wait.

90
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:54,914
Let me see. It's not broken.
What a relief.

91
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,415
I just saved myself some money.

92
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,126
-Thank you.
-Okay.

93
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,253
Jun-u.

94
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,588
Yes?

95
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,632
Is everything going okay?

96
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,969
Are there any difficulties
or things you want to tell me?

97
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,638
-No.
-Really?

98
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,056
I see.

99
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,517
Hey, hold on. Well...

100
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,604
I know that you're not opening up
to me yet.

101
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:22,191
But still, if you face any problems,

102
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,652
don't keep them bottled up
and try to solve them on your own.

103
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,780
You can talk to me openly about them.

104
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:32,910
You know, I've had a lot more
life experience than you, right?

105
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,454
Yes, sir.

106
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,999
"Yes, sir." That sounded so insincere.

107
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,210
-The bell just rang.
-I know.

108
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,717
Who am I kidding?

109
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,886
I'm barely managing
to take care of myself.

110
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,309
S/S SEASON 30% OFF
DON'T MISS THIS CHANCE!

111
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,310
Season...

112
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,394
30% OFF

113
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,106
I don't have any money. Stop it.

114
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:06,777
The cold air mass from Siberia
affects us in the winter.

115
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,154
In the summer...

116
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,113
I did it.

117
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,908
I stole that money.

118
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:12,992
Is he telling the truth?

119
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,081
-Yes.
-I told you.

120
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,583
I said I was right.

121
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,918
My son would never do that.

122
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,252
As you said...

123
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,299
I will transfer to another school.

124
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,092
Jun-u.

125
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:37,475
Jun-u, why...
Why would you do such a thing?

126
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,769
It wasn't you, right?

127
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,898
-I'm sorry, Mom.
-I'm...

128
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,859
-Got it, Ro-mi?
-Yes, ma'am.

129
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:50,071
That's why this happens.

130
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,865
On page 68,

131
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:56,160
there's a list of the air masses
that affect Korea.

132
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,955
The Siberian air mass
affects us in wintertime,

133
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,667
whereas maritime tropical air masses
affect us in the summertime.

134
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,254
When maritime tropical air masses
meet the Okhotsk High,

135
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,755
they form...

136
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,384
-Nice!
-Friday?

137
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:16,180
-Hey, come on.
-Get out of here.

138
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,307
It's a hot mess in here.

139
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:22,436
All right, guys. The class has begun.

140
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,939
Pil-sang, let go of Chan-yeol.

141
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,108
Gyu-nam, break them up.

142
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,736
Da-huin, it's time to go to school.

143
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,447
You're always sleepy
because you starve yourself. Da-huin!

144
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,199
Soo-bin, wake her up.

145
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,035
Guys, let's study.

146
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:42,957
Guys.

147
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,254
Pil-sang, Mr. Oh is here.

148
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,674
I'm sorry, Mr. Oh.
I was so focused on my book.

149
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,926
That's all right. No worries.

150
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,554
All right, then.

151
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,182
Today, we'll...

152
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:08,566
Gi-tae.

153
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,360
I'd like you and Jun-u to switch seats.

154
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,946
-Pardon?
-Why?

155
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,865
Just for the time being.

156
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,993
Still, the two of us want to make
some fond memories together.

157
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,286
No, that won't happen.

158
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,246
But Hwi-yeong told me to sit here.

159
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,749
Gi-tae really is Hwi-yeong's minion.

160
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,922
The class president told you to sit there?

161
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,342
-Yes.
-I see.

162
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:41,515
Mr. Oh, I'll get it sorted out
next time we change seats.

163
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,683
All right.

164
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:47,355
As the class president, make sure
they're all evenly spread out.

165
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,148
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

166
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,989
Did we cover up to page 40 last time?

167
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,658
Okay. Page 40...

168
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,207
But you two should still
switch seats, just until then.

169
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:07,833
I just think it'll be better.

170
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,419
Come on, Gi-tae. Let's do it, okay?

171
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,714
I'm your homeroom teacher.
Show me some respect, please?

172
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,133
I feel so bad for him.

173
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,344
That's pretty pathetic.

174
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:19,887
Show me some respect, please.

175
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,642
-Yes, Mr. Oh. I'll switch.
-Great.

176
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,478
Jun-u, switch seats with Gi-tae.

177
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,824
-Gi-tae.
-Yes?

178
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:40,991
Thank you.

179
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,786
I should listen to you, of course.

180
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,296
All right, guys.
Then we'll start from where...

181
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,011
Okay. Just a moment.

182
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,347
He seems so annoyed, doesn't he?

183
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,183
Gosh, Oh Han-gyeol seems
completely bewildered.

184
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,066
What's the matter with me?

185
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,610
Why am I groveling so much?

186
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,697
I'm their teacher, for God's sake.
I'm an adult.

187
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,328
All right.

188
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:28,956
Sorry, guys.

189
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,335
Let's get started.

190
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,548
Mr. Oh, about our English
performance assessment...

191
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,967
You haven't told us the range
for the listening test.

192
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,387
Well, actually...

193
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,104
-No way! Why?
-Hush, the vice-principal.

194
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,024
What's the matter?
It is a performance assessment.

195
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,569
Wasn't the listening test replacing it?
That's what we did last year.

196
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,071
The listening test isn't the only way
to assess your performance.

197
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:04,200
We want to be original, so we'll do
a free-talking test instead.

198
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,870
-No.
-No way.

199
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,747
-Unbelievable.
-No!

200
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,957
What will be the topic?

201
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,253
The topic will be...

202
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:23,636
-This is crazy.
-Gosh, how original.

203
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,054
-It's so lame.
-Goodness.

204
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,138
It's so original.

205
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,975
All right,
I'll tell you how it'll be done.

206
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,770
You'll converse freely in pairs
for three minutes.

207
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:37,024
The study leader will
randomly pick your partner.

208
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,901
You're okay with it, right?

209
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,152
Me?

210
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,824
-Team up with me.
-Be quiet.

211
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:56,001
Oh Han-gyeol, be calm.

212
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,796
Relax. Be confident...

213
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,714
and graceful.

214
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,473
Look, he's smiling.

215
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,433
Gosh, he's really losing it.

216
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:15,145
I told you. We need to find
a nice lady for him soon.

217
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,981
Come on, guys. Just accept it.

218
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,732
This assessment is
not even that important.

219
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,124
-Sir.
-Yes.

220
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,626
Is my class the only one that
hasn't submitted the budget plan?

221
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,086
Give me a moment. I'll quickly--

222
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,797
It's okay. Your class president
submitted it this morning.

223
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,551
-Hwi-yeong did?
-Yes.

224
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,177
You're so lucky.

225
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:50,347
We're all swamped, but Hwi-yeong
takes care of things like this,

226
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,558
gets the highest marks
on exams and boosts the average,

227
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,602
and even looks after
all of his classmates.

228
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:58,647
I know you're just an assistant teacher,
but this must be your lucky year.

229
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,609
You're right.

230
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,703
Hey, Hwi-yeong. What's up?

231
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,913
Mr. Oh.

232
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,374
About the free-talking test...
Please reconsider.

233
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:18,709
I'm fine with it,

234
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,003
but three days won't be
enough time for the other students.

235
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,381
Plus, the midterm's
just around the corner too.

236
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,593
But this is a test too.

237
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,721
Completing the assignment
within the given amount of time.

238
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,723
-That's how the assessment works.
-Right.

239
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,101
Still, don't you think it'd be risky
to randomly divide into pairs?

240
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,604
This will affect our academic records.

241
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:43,150
Hwi-yeong, you'll do a great job
no matter who your partner is.

242
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:47,112
Well, it'll be great if those
who aren't so good at English

243
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,489
can help each other out.

244
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,743
Yes, understood.

245
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,081
Oh, Hwi-yeong.

246
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,376
Just a second.

247
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,628
Well...

248
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,506
Come here for a second.

249
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,303
As for the class budget plan,

250
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,389
it is my job to write and submit it.

251
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,767
It would've been nice
if you had consulted me about it first.

252
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,438
The headteacher asked me to do it.

253
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,900
I thought it was okay
since you're our assistant teacher.

254
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,823
Even so, I am your homeroom teacher
at the moment.

255
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:33,826
I'll be careful from now on.

256
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,083
Mr. Oh, don't complicate things
for yourself.

257
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,460
If you take on more work,
there will be more things

258
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,255
for you to fill their teacher in on
when he returns.

259
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,631
You're probably right.

260
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,174
-Yes, probably.
-Right.

261
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,677
By the way, when will
their homeroom teacher come back?

262
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:54,638
I'm not sure.

263
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,822
Hello, sir. How are you feeling?

264
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,074
I'm doing very well, thanks to you.

265
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,243
This place is like a nice hotel.

266
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,913
-Hwi-yeong is doing well, right?
-Yes.

267
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:23,709
About the thing I asked you
to look into a little while ago...

268
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,794
I'm wondering if it's coming along well.

269
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,171
You don't need to worry.

270
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:29,506
My gosh. Thank you, Mr. Ma.

271
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,009
I'll take care of the rest, then.

272
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:47,858
Eat up.

273
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:54,406
We don't even have time to study
for exams. What? Free-talking?

274
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,657
That's what I'm saying.

275
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,827
It's always the incompetent teachers
that are overly eager.

276
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,372
I'd say Mr. Oh is pretty competent,
don't you think?

277
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,002
Okay, fine.

278
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:23,519
Gosh, that newbie.
Will he be all right here?

279
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,063
-Because he stole the watch?
-Yes.

280
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,524
He said he didn't do it.

281
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,900
We have no way of knowing.

282
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,860
How can we believe what he says?

283
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,447
Exactly.
They found the watch in his locker.

284
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:36,990
Why are you taking his side?

285
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,659
-I am not.
-You are.

286
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,536
I am not taking his side.

287
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,871
Hey, Da-huin, it's O-je.

288
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,584
It's O-je. O-je.

289
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,338
Hey, O-je.

290
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:52,965
Over here.

291
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,232
There aren't any seats left except here.

292
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,526
What? We saved his seat for nothing.

293
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:17,906
Why did he sit there?

294
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,324
Who cares?

295
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,576
What do you mean, "Who cares?"

296
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,702
She's right.

297
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,413
Do you like basketball?

298
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:26,415
Yes, I do.

299
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,208
I'm good at it too.

300
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,553
You know, our class is like...

301
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,471
a company.

302
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,891
Hwi-yeong's the chairman,

303
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,392
and the others are his minions.

304
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,019
When he gets up once he's done eating,

305
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,645
they'll probably get up with him.

306
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:50,731
Isn't that funny?

307
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,359
But that's just how men are, you know.

308
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,905
They always want to decide
who's stronger than who.

309
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:03,660
What about you?

310
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,163
-What?
-Then what are you like?

311
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,543
What do you think?

312
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,671
What are they doing?

313
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,590
They want to see whose face is smaller?

314
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,092
Well... Just...

315
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,260
"Just"?

316
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,806
Just...

317
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,100
a nice basketball man?

318
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,649
Correct.

319
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,610
What's a nice basketball man?

320
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:37,903
I've never heard that before.

321
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,196
Hey, Jun-u.

322
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,949
I heard you were popular
at your previous school.

323
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,284
You must've been good
at a lot of things other than this.

324
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,995
Sang-hun, what's your problem?
We're eating.

325
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,330
Scram.

326
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,749
Sorry, O-je.

327
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,335
Eat up.

328
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,691
What did he say?

329
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,278
He said to eat my peas.

330
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,616
Well, he's right about that.

331
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,079
Are you done eating?

332
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,681
Slow down.

333
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,894
Go ahead.

334
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,320
You're anxious, aren't you?

335
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,656
About what happened.

336
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,075
You're scared I might tell Jun-u.

337
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,327
About what?

338
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,913
Look at this guy playing dumb.

339
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,292
That's right. You should.
That makes it more fun.

340
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:17,377
Sang-hun.

341
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:19,880
You know what?

342
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,924
-What?
-When you laugh like that,

343
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,635
it's really annoying.

344
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,680
I don't know what you're talking about,

345
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,891
but do as you wish.

346
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,269
Rat me out or whatever.

347
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:44,780
The girls' rep and the guys' rep
will play rock-paper-scissors.

348
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,531
The losing side puts in their names first,

349
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,075
and the winning side picks them. Okay?

350
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,785
-Hey.
-Hey.

351
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,119
There are more guys than girls.

352
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,080
-That's not right.
-Tough luck.

353
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,540
-The leftover guys can pair up.
-Darn it.

354
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,250
I'm getting very nervous.

355
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,335
Now, begin!

356
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,337
-You have to win.
-Good luck.

357
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,422
-You have to win.
-You can do it.

358
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:03,757
Rock, paper,

359
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,758
-scissors!
-Scissors!

360
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,052
-Yes!
-Nice!

361
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,096
-Yes!
-Again!

362
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,347
Come on.

363
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,932
Rock, paper, scissors!

364
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,393
It's okay.

365
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,063
-Rock, paper, scissors!
-Rock, paper, scissors!

366
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:25,487
Okay. The guys, take out a piece
of paper and put your name on it

367
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,364
and give it to me.

368
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,929
Okay. Next is So-ye.

369
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,389
Let's see.

370
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,229
Drum roll, please.

371
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,064
It's Gi-tae?

372
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,942
You're so lucky.
He's really good at English.

373
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,819
-Next, Da-huin.
-Next.

374
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,654
Hey. Aren't you going to pray?

375
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,656
I prayed during a gym class the other day

376
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,700
and got paired up with Pil-sang.

377
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:12,868
Then don't.

378
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:13,994
Anyone but Pil-sang.

379
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,746
Hey. I don't want you either.

380
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,040
-So what?
-Right back at you.

381
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,337
Is it Pil-sang again?

382
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,343
-O-je.
-Oh. It's me.

383
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,262
Let's do our best, Da-huin.

384
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:33,388
Okay.

385
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,641
Next. Ro-mi.

386
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,775
-Why? Who did you get? Ro-mi!
-Who is it?

387
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,404
-Who is it?
-Pil-sang!

388
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:50,530
Oh my!

389
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,742
Yes!

390
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,619
-Hey!
-Ro-mi!

391
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,245
Ro-mi!

392
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,872
That's going to be so much fun!

393
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,708
Okay, Chan-yeol.

394
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,376
Chan-yeol's turn.

395
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,087
Darn it.

396
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,132
It's bad. You go first.

397
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:12,010
Okay. Then I'll pick first.

398
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,766
What a unique shape.

399
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:20,185
Here, for you.

400
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,811
It's okay.

401
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,773
Take it. I have a lot.

402
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,328
Who's in charge of recycling
in this class?

403
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,131
Hey. What are you doing here?

404
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,677
It's my turn to do this.

405
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,054
Aren't you preparing
for the free-talking test?

406
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,181
I will.

407
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,058
Who picked me?

408
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,982
I guess no one picked me.

409
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,947
CHOE JUN-U

410
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,128
When are you free?

411
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:31,589
Not now.

412
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,467
What? I picked him,
and he's playing hard-to-get?

413
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,678
Just so you know,
I'm not playing hard-to-get.

414
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,807
I need to get to work right now.

415
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:43,560
Well...

416
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:48,356
I'm still too new to ask for a day off
for personal reasons.

417
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:53,737
I don't have time right now either.

418
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:55,822
I have to go.

419
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:01,453
Okay.

420
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,830
I'll message you later.

421
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:05,415
Okay.

422
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,419
Jun-u, what's your dream?

423
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,341
My dream?

424
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,261
I don't know.

425
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,387
What?

426
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,765
What? Then how...

427
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:24,851
Fine.

428
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:28,188
Then think of anything for now

429
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:30,106
since we have to take the test. Okay?

430
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:42,577
See you.

431
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:44,579
Bye.

432
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,291
Who hasn't turned it in yet?

433
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,793
Are you done? I'll turn it in.

434
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,044
If you're done, pass it forward.

435
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:54,923
Hold on.

436
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,967
Why is it taking so long to write a name?

437
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,052
Hurry up.

438
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,161
Jun-u is kind of cute.

439
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,664
He even knows how to use a secret code.

440
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:30,750
About the list of references.
I checked all the cited parts...

441
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,131
Hey, Hwi-yeong!

442
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,844
How could you just leave? We're partners.

443
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,512
Oh, right. I'm looking forward to it.

444
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,726
What should we do?
First, let's go to the snack shop

445
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,644
and talk over a cup of latte.

446
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,730
Sorry, but I have to go now.

447
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:54,232
I'll make the script by tomorrow,
including yours.

448
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,109
All you have to do is memorize it.

449
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:58,403
Let's check it together
on the day of the test. Bye.

450
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:01,865
Hey. How could you just leave?

451
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,616
Do you know what my dream is?

452
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,326
You don't know anything about me.

453
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,537
Don't worry.

454
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,456
I'll make you get a perfect score.

455
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,124
Just focus on preparing for the midterm.

456
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,879
Hey, Hwi-yeong. Hey!

457
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,423
Thanks!

458
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,471
Hello.

459
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,389
Yeong-bae, why are you so late?

460
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,099
She's been waiting for a long time.

461
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,811
-Mom.
-You're late to work.

462
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:34,689
Tell me about it.
He's always five minutes late.

463
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:42,113
Jun-u, you should know better.
You're being paid for this.

464
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,407
You should arrive
at least 15 minutes early,

465
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:47,994
pull yourself together,
and be ready to work.

466
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,622
Mom, is something wrong?

467
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,457
Why did you suddenly come here?

468
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,919
I had some business nearby,
so I dropped by.

469
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,129
You should've gone home then.
Why did you come here?

470
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,423
You're working here.
Why would I go to an empty house?

471
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,133
I have to go back soon anyway.

472
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,260
Let's go eat.

473
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:07,138
I have to work.

474
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,224
The owner said you can go.

475
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,476
Of course, I helped her persuade him.

476
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,230
-This is delicious.
-Is it?

477
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,982
Have some, Jun-u.

478
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,404
Hey,

479
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,283
you're not hanging your head at school

480
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,577
because of that watch incident, are you?

481
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,996
Don't worry, I'm not.

482
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,917
Good. The truth always gets revealed
one day.

483
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:38,628
Right.

484
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:41,506
You didn't hear from the kids
from the previous school, right?

485
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,591
How about Jeong-hu? Shin Jeong-hu.

486
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,760
Doesn't he call you?

487
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:47,262
No.

488
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:51,349
Well, he shouldn't
if he has a sense of shame.

489
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:53,685
You were forced to transfer
because of him.

490
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,687
Jeong-hu isn't a bad kid.

491
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,897
-You know that.
-Of course.

492
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,400
I adored Jeong-hu so much.

493
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:10,326
But whenever I think about that day...

494
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,664
It feels so unfair

495
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,624
and upsetting.

496
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,168
Mom.

497
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,588
You promised not to cry.

498
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,048
Okay, I won't cry.

499
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,719
Anyway, you should really...

500
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:31,180
just focus on studying from now on.

501
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,892
Don't get caught up in anything
unnecessary. Do you understand?

502
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:34,976
I understand.

503
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:36,686
Promise me.

504
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,980
I promise.

505
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:40,815
Don't cry.

506
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,990
Mom. You came because you were
worried about me, didn't you?

507
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,450
You didn't have any business here.

508
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,204
-No.
-Come on, don't lie.

509
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,497
I'm not lying.

510
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,087
Let's eat.

511
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,857
These are so difficult.

512
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,984
SON JAE-YEONG MATHEMATICS

513
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,411
You should try your best, Soo-bin.

514
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,124
You should go, or you'll be late.

515
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,876
Let me walk a bit more with you.

516
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:46,923
I told you to wear your hair like this.
So people can see your forehead.

517
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,299
-Like this.
-I'll do it.

518
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,135
-No, it looks better like this.
-I can do it.

519
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,978
Hi. Hello, ma'am.

520
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,313
Oh, is she from your class?

521
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,524
Hi. I'm Jun-u's mom.

522
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,192
Oh, hello, ma'am.

523
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,653
It's nice to meet you.

524
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,827
We're in a bit of a hurry, so...

525
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,245
I'll see you again.

526
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,414
Goodbye.

527
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,128
Who is that?

528
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:26,504
He's good-looking.

529
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:29,173
He's a guy who transferred to our school.

530
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:33,094
-Mom.
-Gosh, this is embarrassing.

531
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,722
Her handbag looked real.

532
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,224
That handbag was fake.

533
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,560
She must be embarrassed right now.

534
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,895
Well, everyone carries around
fakes these days.

535
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,231
I heard a real one costs
more than 10 million won.

536
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,649
Is she rich?

537
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,027
I don't know.

538
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,778
Is she really his mom? She's so young.

539
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,822
I don't know. Let's go.

540
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,449
That boy is so handsome.

541
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:55,575
Okay, whatever.

542
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:58,202
I knew it.
This neighborhood is really rich.

543
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,912
I should be more careful.

544
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:12,216
That's not true.
I'm really bad at English.

545
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,427
I'm really impressed, though.

546
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,555
I'm so glad I met the perfect partner.

547
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,477
Where are you?

548
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:27,982
I'm waiting for Hwi-yeong.

549
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,489
Can you believe this?

550
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:38,451
He says he's glad he met
the perfect partner.

551
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:39,952
O-je said that.

552
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:41,746
Be quiet.

553
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,498
Are you going to marry him or what?

554
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,000
-I'm here.
-Hey.

555
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,585
Where have you been?

556
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,213
What? Well...

557
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:53,508
Didn't your mom come to school earlier?

558
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,928
She wanted to look around
for some academies.

559
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,430
Gosh, your mom is so persistent.

560
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,975
How are you going to prepare
for the English free-talking test?

561
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:03,935
With Jun-u.

562
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,771
Oh, right.

563
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,314
God, this is so annoying.

564
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:10,358
How can I do it with Pil-sang?

565
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,569
Jun-u won't be an easy partner either.

566
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,116
-Thank you.
-Have a good day.

567
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:32,338
Jun-u. Can you send me
five sentences in English?

568
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,422
Anything.

569
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:38,594
Why?

570
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,721
"Why?"

571
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:46,894
It's a level test. To see
how good you are at English.

572
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:50,773
Does this sound too arrogant?

573
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:02,702
I want to see how you use English.
For reference.

574
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,921
Yeong-bae, I'm going home.

575
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,631
Goodbye.

576
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:17,633
Wait.

577
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,344
Do you speak English?

578
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,765
Then can you help me
write some sentences in English?

579
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:25,892
Write...

580
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,562
Oh, yes. Dad?

581
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:30,730
Hey, wait.

582
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:35,818
Why isn't he answering?

583
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:41,616
Jun-u?

584
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:43,701
Jun-u?

585
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:47,955
Jun-u?

586
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:51,792
My...

587
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,172
Jun-u?

588
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,487
Ma Hwi-yeong?

589
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,031
Choe Jun-u?

590
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,165
Welcome--

591
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,877
How's it going?
Preparing for the free-talking test.

592
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:39,924
So so.

593
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,760
That won't cut it.

594
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,846
Soo-bin is in the top tier in English.

595
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,724
If her performance assessment,
English exams,

596
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:51,769
and academic records are all ruined
because of you, what will you do?

597
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,109
I'll make sure that won't happen.

598
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,863
Don't worry. I'll sort it out.

599
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:13,082
I don't think it's something
you can sort out.

600
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,130
I can help.

601
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,050
For Soo-bin, not for you.

602
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:24,969
Because she's my girlfriend.

603
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,521
Do you not scratch yourself these days?

604
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:36,439
What?

605
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,233
You scratch yourself on the wrist
when you're anxious.

606
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:43,237
I think you're probably very anxious now

607
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,281
for many reasons.

608
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,204
Welcome.

609
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:20,733
Hey, Hwi-yeong.

610
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,779
I met the guys at Byeongmun High.

611
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:26,822
It went well.

612
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,366
"Well"?

613
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:30,576
How?

614
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,413
Hey.

615
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,627
Check the amount.

616
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,587
Are you kidding us?

617
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,799
-Give us more.
-Finish him.

618
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,634
Then I'll give you more.

619
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,262
Hey, where are you going?

620
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:51,847
Give us a little more!

621
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,265
-We need more than this!
-Well...

622
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,809
They'll take care of it.

623
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:57,061
They promised to make sure
Jun-u gets expelled.

624
00:39:59,021 --> 00:39:59,939
Well done.

625
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,652
What about the mock exam? Did you do well?

626
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,070
Me?

627
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,241
I'm going to start a study coaching group.

628
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,326
My mom's looking for good tutors
at the moment.

629
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,453
I'll let you join without a level test.

630
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:15,621
Really?

631
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,207
I really needed help.
Thanks a lot, Hwi-yeong.

632
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,333
I'll study hard.

633
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,335
See you tomorrow.

634
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,088
Good night.

635
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,736
I'm home.

636
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,114
Mom...

637
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,160
Your mom is asleep. Don't wake her up.

638
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,949
Mom, are you okay?

639
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,091
Oh, are you leaving for the day?

640
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,551
-Yes.
-All right.

641
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,430
Wait.

642
00:41:58,265 --> 00:41:59,308
Did something happen?

643
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:01,560
No.

644
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,813
-Have a good night.
-All right.

645
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:05,940
Bye.

646
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,875
I can help.

647
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:28,629
For Soo-bin, not for you.
Because she's my girlfriend.

648
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:32,091
No way. We're just friends.

649
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,801
Right, Little Boy?

650
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:37,846
Which one of them should I believe?

651
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,947
How's it going, Jun-u?

652
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,365
Let's meet up.

653
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,757
Hey, are you ignoring my text?

654
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,009
All right, then.

655
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:27,980
CHOE JUN-U

656
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:38,741
CHOE JUN-U

657
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:40,576
Gosh. Jun-u, this fool...

658
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,745
I WANT TO SEE HOW YOU USE ENGLISH.
FOR REFERENCE. JUN-U?

659
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:14,443
Are you home?

660
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:15,778
HWI-YEONG

661
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,494
Yes.

662
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:25,663
What are you doing?

663
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,500
Judging by that question,

664
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:32,002
I'm assuming you're probably not
in a great mood, Hwi-yeong.

665
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,130
No, I was just curious.

666
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:37,216
I suddenly thought of you.

667
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,889
Right, what did Mr. Son say?

668
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,391
About my level test.

669
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,893
He hasn't mentioned anything yet.

670
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:51,855
I probably didn't pass, then.

671
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,775
What should I do?
My mom will be so mad at me.

672
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:19,883
CHOE JUN-U

673
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,542
What's with you, Jun-u?

674
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,837
If you're struggling with writing in
English, tell me what your dream is.

675
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:57,754
In Korean.

676
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:03,969
Dream?

677
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,908
My dream? To sleep with the lights off.

678
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,036
"To sleep with the lights off"?

679
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:32,498
Sleep?

680
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,586
Gosh. How childish.

681
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:39,129
What's his deal?

682
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:42,299
CHEONBONG HIGH SCHOOL

683
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,135
Can you believe
Son Heung-min was sent off for that?

684
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,012
I'm sure the referee was bribed.

685
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:48,764
Tackle.

686
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,145
What a sad attempt.

687
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,689
-Does the new kid play soccer?
-Who knows?

688
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:00,609
-He looks like he can't play.
-Should we ask?

689
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:02,277
Soo-bin is in the top tier in English.

690
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,988
If her performance assessment,
English exams,

691
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:07,658
and academic records are all ruined
because of you, what will you do?

692
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,409
Right? That's right.

693
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,578
No, don't you dare.

694
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:14,790
You don't need to talk me up to Mr. Son.

695
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,084
If I bombed the test, so be it.

696
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,585
That's all I'm capable of.

697
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,421
Don't worry, Soo-bin.

698
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,674
You won't fail. You always do well.

699
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:24,716
Hey, newbie!

700
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,843
He never responds.

701
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,095
What position do you play?

702
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,764
Are things going well with Jun-u
for the English free-talking test?

703
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:35,060
I don't know. I'm stumped.

704
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:40,983
Jun-u?

705
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,151
Hey. See you later.

706
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:46,655
Hey, newbie! What position do you play?

707
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:49,241
-Just be a goalie, punk!
-He's running again.

708
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:51,076
Hey! You punk.

709
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,376
Soo-bin.

710
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:04,798
What was that?

711
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:08,010
Your dream is to sleep
with the lights off?

712
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,304
-Are you kidding me?
-Feel free to change...

713
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:13,265
your English partner if you want.

714
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,184
-What?
-I stink at English,

715
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:17,644
and I have no dream.

716
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:23,442
Don't ruin your grades because of me,
and get a new partner.

717
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:28,196
Hey. You are so shameless. You know that?

718
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,657
You sent me that strange text last night

719
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,534
after ignoring my texts.

720
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,245
And now, what?

721
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,331
Strange?

722
00:48:37,914 --> 00:48:40,083
Like the literature
performance assessment,

723
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,462
I'm doing this out of concern for you.

724
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:46,298
You shouldn't be like this to me.

725
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:48,091
Why are you concerned about me?

726
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:52,929
Because I was forced to transfer here
and seem like a loser?

727
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:57,142
You must feel some kind of sense of duty

728
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:59,353
towards kids like me.

729
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,487
Thanks, but it's okay.

730
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,489
You don't need to be concerned.

731
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,704
Why did you draw the peas then?

732
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:20,040
Didn't you mean...

733
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:24,503
you wanted help?

734
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:26,421
Because you wanted to do your best too.

735
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:37,849
I draw things like that all the time
out of habit.

736
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:43,522
Maybe I should just change my partner.

737
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:48,902
What's wrong with me?

738
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,864
Kim So-wol was a poet that cared a lot

739
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,033
about the form of poetry.

740
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:58,036
-This poem is the best example.
-Peas?

741
00:49:58,328 --> 00:49:59,705
Are you craving peas?

742
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,125
No.

743
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:11,425
If you lay the poem on its side,
it looks like a mountain.

744
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:15,762
That is exactly what the poet intended.

745
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,473
For the next stanza...

746
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:24,479
If you take a look...

747
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:51,798
Here.

748
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,092
I wrote down my dream.

749
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:59,139
If you write it in English for me,
I'll memorize it.

750
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:10,901
Are... Are you okay?

751
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,198
What's with him?

752
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:18,366
What is it?

753
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:20,327
No.

754
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,829
Why won't you let me see it?

755
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:26,291
-Where are you going?
-To the restroom.

756
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:45,560
My dream is to fall asleep
in a dark room with the lights off.

757
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:49,231
I often had to sleep alone
when I was a child,

758
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:50,649
so I slept with the lights on

759
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:52,734
because I felt like

760
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:56,279
zombies, ghosts, and monsters
would attack me

761
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,949
if I turned off the lights.

762
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,203
And I still sleep with the lights on.

763
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:05,539
Not because I'm afraid of ghosts...

764
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:15,048
Okay, Soo-bin.
Hurry up and take your seat.

765
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:26,017
Do you want to work on English?
At the snack shop after school?

766
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:28,061
Are you preparing for the free-talk?

767
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:29,813
-No!
-Yes!

768
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:31,690
Can't we change partners?

769
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:33,066
No, you can't.

770
00:52:33,149 --> 00:52:35,360
Why? I'm good at English.

771
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:38,655
Not at school. After school, at the park?

772
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:43,660
Anyway, prepare well for the free-talk.

773
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,162
I'll see you tomorrow then.

774
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:47,622
-Okay.
-Work hard!

775
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:49,332
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

776
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:52,711
Good luck.

777
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:54,921
Fine. As you want.

778
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:08,184
Hello, Mr. Son.

779
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:09,978
Do you have...

780
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,647
Yoo Soo-bin's level test result?

781
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:15,233
Hey! Where are you going?
Aren't you going to the library?

782
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:16,860
See you later.

783
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:23,909
Okay.

784
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:29,497
Hey, don't push!

785
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:34,336
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with my heart?

786
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,630
It's because I'm annoyed.

787
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:39,591
How will I teach that fool, Jun-u?

788
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:01,655
Hello?

789
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:19,547
Sorry, something urgent came up.

790
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:36,731
He's here.

791
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:37,816
Jeong-hu.

792
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,360
Jun-u. Long time no see.

793
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:41,569
See? He came.

794
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:45,073
He ignored our calls, but he came
right away when his best friend called.

795
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:46,408
Jeong-hu, are you okay?

796
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,035
Yes, I'm okay.

797
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:53,164
Are you disappointed that he's fine
after you ran all the way here?

798
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,668
Hey. You're here anyway.
Let's work out a little together.

799
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,713
-Hey. Are you scared?
-He's leaving.

800
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,881
Hey, Jun-u! Aren't you going to fight?

801
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,092
What if I do this?

802
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:06,720
What if I do this?

803
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:08,596
-You promised not to do this.
-I didn't.

804
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,015
Did you believe that, you shit?

805
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:12,600
-You wimp. You loser.
-You shit!

806
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:14,227
Your friend's dying here!

807
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:15,854
Get over here.

808
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:19,190
Now that you transferred to a good
school, you don't need your friend?

809
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,984
You will just save yourself, huh?

810
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:22,152
Stop that.

811
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:23,778
You fuck.

812
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:27,198
You should really
just focus on studying from now on.

813
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,993
Don't get caught up in anything
unnecessary. Do you understand?

814
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,412
Get over here, you shit!

815
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:35,498
Don't act like you're better
than us, and fight!

816
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:37,709
Your friend is going to die today.

817
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,461
I said to stop it, you bastard!

818
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:42,255
Stay down.

819
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:45,508
Jun-u.

820
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:48,094
-Damn it.
-Jun-u!

821
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:50,513
Move, you shit.

822
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:58,354
Do you think you're better than us?

823
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:01,149
What is that?

824
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:02,400
Run, Jun-u!

825
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:07,781
-The cops are here.
-Let's get out of here.

826
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,742
Hey! If we catch you,
you're dead, Jeong-hu!

827
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,793
Hurry up, Jeong-hu!

828
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:21,961
My mom isn't home today!

829
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:24,339
Jun-u, wait for me!

830
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:43,983
Why do you live like this?

831
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:46,402
Do you think I was transferred
for you to be treated like this?

832
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:48,113
You must've felt relieved.

833
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:51,366
After leaving like that.

834
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,952
You made me feel so guilty.

835
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:56,579
I told you to go somewhere else
and start anew.

836
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:57,914
Don't be ridiculous.

837
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:01,709
Start what?

838
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:03,670
It's the same no matter where I go.

839
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:07,632
For losers like us, it's miserable
no matter where we go.

840
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:12,262
Jeong-hu, why do you think like that?

841
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:14,973
You weren't like this before.

842
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:20,019
CHOE JUN-U

843
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,105
Do you think a new name tag and uniform

844
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,482
will change your life?

845
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:27,026
Never.

846
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:30,864
Our lives were messed up
from the moment we were born.

847
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,535
I got to go.

848
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,789
Hey, Jeong-hu.

849
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:43,668
Hey.

850
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:52,635
Mom. When are you coming home?

851
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,012
Today too?

852
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:56,556
What time are you coming home?

853
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:01,144
Choe Jun-u. Jun-u!

854
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:10,487
I thought you might be scared.

855
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:12,489
Hey, Jeong-hu.

856
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:21,956
You're not scared of the dark now, right?

857
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,208
Since I'm here.

858
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:26,628
No. I've always wanted to sleep
with the lights off.

859
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,171
Let's sleep.

860
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:30,965
You coward.

861
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:44,145
CHOE JUN-U

862
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:59,244
Right, it's just how Jun-u is.

863
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:04,165
An irresponsible
and hopeless troublemaker.

864
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:10,380
Pull yourself together, Soo-bin.

865
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,305
-Oh, my.
-Hey, Soo-bin!

866
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:22,225
My daughter.

867
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,562
Yoo Soo-bin! Come here, my sweetie.

868
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:28,398
You passed the test for Mr. Son's class.

869
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:30,817
Come here. They're here
to congratulate you. Say hi.

870
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:32,068
My daughter is home.

871
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:34,195
-Hi.
-Hello, Soo-bin.

872
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:36,114
Soo-bin, congratulations.

873
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:38,199
-Great job.
-Yes, congratulations.

874
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,784
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

875
00:59:39,867 --> 00:59:41,828
It's true that I tried hard,

876
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:44,330
but Hwi-yeong was very concerned
about you too.

877
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:47,333
Soo-bin, I hope you do your best

878
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:48,960
for Hwi-yeong's sake too.

879
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:51,713
She will do her best.

880
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:53,131
I'm so glad for you.

881
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:55,800
-Oh. my.
-Are you okay?

882
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:59,929
Stay still. I'll take care of it.

883
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:01,222
Oh, boy.

884
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:03,808
-Right over here.
-Yes, I see it.

885
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:06,269
Gosh, you could've gotten hurt.

886
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:08,271
-Can you lift your foot?
-Okay.

887
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:11,232
-Can you lift the other foot?
-Okay.

888
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:12,650
She's trying so hard.

889
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:15,236
Oh, right.

890
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:17,030
Soo-bin!

891
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:21,075
Oh, my. Ms. Yoon, are you okay?

892
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,160
Are you all right?

893
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:23,244
I'm fine.

894
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:41,512
Hey. How could you just leave like that?
You should sit down and talk.

895
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:44,432
Are you her servant?

896
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:47,143
Did I make it to Mr. Son's class
because of her?

897
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:49,896
Of course.

898
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:53,858
You wouldn't have
if it weren't for Hwi-yeong's family.

899
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:56,319
I did okay on the test.
It's not because of Hwi-yeong.

900
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:57,945
Are you kidding me?

901
01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:00,531
You know your math skills
are not good enough.

902
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:02,325
You're not even in the top tier in math.

903
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:03,868
Mom.

904
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:05,912
Seriously...

905
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:07,997
You embarrass me.

906
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:10,667
Who cares if you graduated from SNU
and work at a good company?

907
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:13,836
When I see how you act around
that lady, it's really...

908
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:16,130
embarrassing.

909
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:18,132
Look who's talking.

910
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:20,968
Who is the one that made me like this?

911
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:24,305
Who's the one who made
a proud woman like me into a servant?

912
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:26,724
Cut the nonsense and come out.

913
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:28,226
No.

914
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:30,311
Come out.

915
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:32,939
She's about to introduce more tutors
for other subjects.

916
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,482
You have to make a good impression.

917
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:37,110
-Come out. Listen to me!
-No.

918
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:39,362
-Come out.
-I said, no.

919
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,197
Be careful then.

920
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:45,868
Oh, no. She has severe menstrual cramps.

921
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,578
-Really?
-Yes.

922
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:49,038
She ran out of her medicine.

923
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:50,081
That's too bad.

924
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,791
-She must be sensitive.
-Yes.

925
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:30,121
-Right over here.
-Yes, I see it.

926
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:40,882
Why does it have to rain now?

927
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:51,494
You...

928
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:56,165
Why are you...

929
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:05,967
You don't have an umbrella?

930
01:04:07,593 --> 01:04:09,220
Why else do you think I'm walking
like this?

931
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:15,017
I don't have one either.

932
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:27,238
So what?

933
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,365
Do you have something to say?

934
01:04:34,078 --> 01:04:35,955
What happened to your face?

935
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:37,248
I have something to say.

936
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:40,668
What?

937
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:49,510
No, you don't have anything to say.

938
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:54,432
You even left like that earlier
after promising me.

939
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:58,603
Don't walk in the rain.

940
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:00,563
What?

941
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:03,691
That's what I wanted to say.

942
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:07,111
It's really bad for you

943
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:09,196
if you get wet in the rain.

944
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:44,333
It was in my pocket.

945
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,169
How come you're not asking
why I was walking around like this?

946
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:49,630
How come you're not asking
why I'm such a mess?

947
01:06:50,047 --> 01:06:51,048
Hey.

948
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:52,550
What's up with that mask?

949
01:06:52,633 --> 01:06:55,344
Are you in a boy band or what? Come here.
What happened to your face?

950
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:57,888
I'd like to meet
Jun-u's previous homeroom teacher.

951
01:06:57,972 --> 01:06:59,890
But is this really your dream?

952
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:00,975
Then what is your dream?

953
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,144
-Fifty times?
-Do you want ten more?

954
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:06,564
Why do you always
feel uncomfortable around me?

955
01:07:06,647 --> 01:07:08,482
And you don't like to be my girlfriend.

956
01:07:08,649 --> 01:07:11,402
Hey, Shin Jeong-hu! Jun-u, stop Jeong-hu.

957
01:07:12,236 --> 01:07:15,614
Jeong-hu, our lives are
not that messed up after all.

958
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:24,874
