1
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,210
Put your bags in here. Okay.

2
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:46,880
You don't have a bag?

3
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,476
Hey, sit here.

4
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,637
Choe Jun-u.

5
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,858
Soo-bin, did you get my message?

6
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,860
Your mom told you, right?

7
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,076
We have an orientation
with the new tutor tomorrow.

8
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,828
Come to my place by 5 p.m.

9
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:01,955
Let's talk about it later.

10
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,795
It's about our tutor.

11
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,880
All right, guys.

12
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,301
My beloved students in Class Three.

13
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,846
-We don't love you!
-But I love you guys.

14
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,140
Pil-sang, are you already asleep?

15
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,809
All right. The class president
and vice president.

16
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,060
Is everyone here?

17
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,228
-Yes.
-Good.

18
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:28,523
All right, then.
Sir, we're ready to leave!

19
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,986
Here, please drive safely.

20
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,404
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

21
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,572
Let's go!

22
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,832
-Can you do that for me too?
-What?

23
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,838
-Here.
-It's your belt.

24
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,107
Gosh, they're so quiet.
I guess they had too much fun.

25
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:18,656
Mr. Oh, I'd like to meet with you
as soon as you arrive.

26
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,658
There's an urgent matter
we need to discuss.

27
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,785
This is what I was going to send you
the other day.

28
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:07,080
I should've checked with you first,
but I couldn't

29
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,456
because

30
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,542
I felt like I'd keep liking you

31
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,212
even if the text message
turned out to be true.

32
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,880
I was embarrassed

33
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:18,091
that you might find out
about the way I felt.

34
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,559
You guys were all happy, right?

35
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:31,104
-Yes.
-I guess only I had a great time.

36
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,272
You guys all did great.

37
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,607
Now, you all must go straight home.

38
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,150
All right, you're dismissed!

39
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,360
-Dismissed!
-Let's go!

40
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,529
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

41
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,905
Let's go.

42
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,784
I'll get going.

43
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,789
-Congratulations, Soo-bin.
-For what?

44
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,208
The word has already spread.
You and Jun-u.

45
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,463
Be happy together.

46
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,260
-I'm off.
-Ro-mi, you're leaving?

47
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,846
Hey, enough.

48
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,180
We can go again.

49
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,182
-Here.
-Thank you.

50
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,309
You took it, right?

51
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,646
Hey, partner.

52
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,525
We've gotten quite close, haven't we?

53
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,028
Like this, one, two, one, two.

54
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,990
And please do a tarot card reading
for me. Promise.

55
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,910
O-je, do you want to hang out with us?

56
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,205
I have to go work at my dad's restaurant.

57
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,498
I'm off.

58
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,959
-Bye.
-Bye.

59
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,711
Bye, Mr. Oh!

60
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,880
Hey, are you feeling sick?

61
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:41,632
-Your face is beet red.
-It really is.

62
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,218
Maybe it's because
I forgot to wear my sunscreen.

63
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,595
My gosh, you got a sunburn.

64
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,513
Girls, let's go to the sauna.
My entire body aches.

65
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,640
Sounds good! Let's go.

66
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,559
Okay, let's all go to the sauna together.

67
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,352
-Let's go.
-Let's go to the sauna together.

68
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,938
I just want to go home. I'm quite tired.

69
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,524
-Hey, come on.
-Come on. Come with us.

70
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,068
Let's go!

71
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:03,196
-Let's go to the sauna.
-Let's go.

72
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,661
Soo-bin and I are supposed to hang out.

73
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:14,082
Well, do you want to go
to the sauna with us?

74
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,586
I want to spend time with just you today.

75
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,298
That's okay with you girls, right?

76
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,344
-Yes, of course.
-My gosh.

77
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,723
-I actually have plans!
-My gosh, me too!

78
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,726
Hey, hurry. Let's go.

79
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,318
They're gone.

80
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:43,736
Shall we go?

81
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,599
A moment like this is actually here.

82
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:17,645
-What?
-Just two of us spending time together.

83
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,984
But there were many moments
like this in the past.

84
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,612
Right, there were.

85
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,282
But I think this is the first time

86
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,243
that we're really spending time together

87
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,328
with no one else around.

88
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,671
Soo-bin.

89
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,382
Please...

90
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,427
be good to me from now on.

91
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:57,143
-I ask you to do the same.
-Okay.

92
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,402
-Isn't this so delicious?
-Who suggested this place?

93
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,404
-Me.
-It was a good call.

94
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,491
O-je! Were you out for delivery?

95
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,075
I thought you went to the sauna.

96
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,994
Oh, I ran into my friends on the way.

97
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,370
Say hello.

98
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,539
-Hello.
-Hello.

99
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:19,957
Is Da-huin your first love?

100
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,001
-What do you like about her?
-When did you start dating?

101
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:22,960
Let's take a picture.

102
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,254
-Da-huin, let's take a picture.
-Okay, sure.

103
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,385
Maybe you could lower...

104
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,596
Okay, one, two, three.

105
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,097
Let's take one more.

106
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,850
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

107
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,061
-My gosh.
-Hey, sit down.

108
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,608
-Da-huin.
-Why are you mad at me?

109
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,693
Because I showed up
with my friends unannounced?

110
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,071
Well, they really wanted to see you.

111
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,156
I'm just a little flustered.

112
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,243
All my friends are hounding me now.
The photo is everywhere already.

113
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,246
Are you upset that everyone now
knows we're in a relationship?

114
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,164
-It's not that.
-Why?

115
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,708
Did you not want your friends to
find out I'm your girlfriend?

116
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,836
-Because I'm not pretty?
-Why does that matter?

117
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,256
And you're pretty. You really are.

118
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,800
What, then? Am I the only one
that's been taking this seriously?

119
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,927
No, that's not what I meant.

120
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:16,889
Are you mad at me?

121
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:21,435
-I'm very shy, you know.
-I see.

122
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,104
I didn't know. I'm sorry I overreacted.

123
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,897
My friends and I
will eat quickly and leave.

124
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,066
Try to be nice to them until they leave.

125
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,443
Hey, Da-huin.

126
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,120
What did you mean, then?

127
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,793
O-je...

128
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,379
PETITION

129
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:52,466
The parents who want a new homeroom
teacher for Class Three have signed this.

130
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,803
They're all in agreement
that they should have a teacher

131
00:09:55,886 --> 00:10:00,016
who has more experience
with college admission.

132
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,935
It's not 100 percent of the parents,
but most of them--

133
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,937
I don't think this is most of them.

134
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,316
In any case,
more than half of the parents--

135
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,860
Let's count. Two, four, five...

136
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:14,447
Mr. Oh, the number isn't important.

137
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,115
Even if it isn't a majority,

138
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:19,452
the fact that most parents of
the students who get good grades

139
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,495
-are taking such action--
-This

140
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:25,249
was started by Hwi-yeong's mother.

141
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,045
Why? Because I'm against
the intensive English class?

142
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,672
Or because I didn't obey her?

143
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:36,093
Mr. Oh. Listen,
I understand what you think.

144
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,346
But can't you try to be
more accommodating?

145
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,890
How could you let this happen?

146
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,391
I'm not quite following.

147
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,769
All I know is that I won't falter.

148
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,440
Gosh, this is a big problem.

149
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:52,276
Goodness, I'm really offended this time.

150
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,821
I mean, right after that fun trip...

151
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,457
MR. OH HAN-GYEOL

152
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:10,920
Goodness.

153
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,130
Your call has been declined.

154
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,217
Declined? She declined my call?

155
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,220
For goodness' sake.

156
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,474
Do you think I'll care
if you come out against me?

157
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,851
I'll just persuade
the other mothers first...

158
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,063
I'll persuade... I can't.

159
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,151
Why am I becoming all timid
all of a sudden again?

160
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:43,953
Mister, I'm sad too!

161
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,330
Let's cry together.

162
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,503
That much?

163
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,922
I don't have that much money.

164
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,966
Mom, don't cry.

165
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,969
I'll come up with the money
no matter what. Yes.

166
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,805
Don't forget to take your medicine, okay?

167
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,460
My mom's on a business trip,
so she'll come tomorrow.

168
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,179
I mean, don't worry
about running into my mom.

169
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,806
Still, the neighbors may see.

170
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,852
Hello.

171
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:53,898
You should go now.

172
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:58,861
After watching you go in.

173
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:00,529
See you.

174
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,911
-Right, tomorrow...
-Tomorrow...

175
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,373
Let's think about what we'll do
tomorrow and talk later.

176
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,075
Did you think I was gone?

177
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,289
I'm really going now.

178
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:53,457
Okay.

179
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,502
-Bye!
-Bye.

180
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,925
We're going to meet tomorrow too.

181
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,469
And the day after tomorrow,
and the day after that.

182
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,014
I can like you tomorrow too.

183
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,642
And the day after tomorrow,
and the day after that.

184
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,769
I can like you every single day.

185
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,734
You're late.

186
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:21,819
Mom.

187
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,196
Why are you so surprised?
Did you do something bad?

188
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,448
Your school trip ended hours ago.
Why are you so late?

189
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,993
I'll let it slide
since you came back from the trip.

190
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:32,371
Mom, weren't you coming tomorrow?

191
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,665
That was the plan,
but my work ended early.

192
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,166
Why? You don't like me coming early?

193
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,460
No way. I'm glad.

194
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,588
-I'll go rest.
-Okay.

195
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,925
Hey. Did you like it that much?

196
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,555
The air over there must've been so fresh.
Your face is gleaming.

197
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:51,599
I envy you, Soo-bin.

198
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,642
I want to quit work and go traveling too.

199
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,438
I envy you.

200
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,024
That was so close.

201
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:17,875
Are you looking for a perfume?

202
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,795
Yes. I want to buy a gift.

203
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,547
Oh, for your girlfriend?

204
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,674
Yes.

205
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,482
The perfume you just chose
has a neutral scent,

206
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,651
and it's very popular
for couples to use together.

207
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,653
You can test it if you want.

208
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:49,907
Here you go.

209
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,159
You can spray it if you want.

210
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:55,329
Spray it in the air,
and you'll smell it in a more natural way.

211
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,524
Yes, I'm telling you. I give in.

212
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,943
I give in to your passion
for your daughter, Ms. Yoon.

213
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,736
But there's one thing.

214
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,031
I hope the other moms
don't find out about this.

215
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:35,285
They keep saying that I'm only
favoring Soo-bin.

216
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,079
Of course.

217
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,540
You should.
You better pay me back one day.

218
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,085
What? No way.

219
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,295
Okay, fine.

220
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,673
Ms. Yoon, aren't you overworking
yourself though?

221
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,551
There are so many things I want to do.

222
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:54,013
Then... Why don't we each say
what we want to do?

223
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,891
Let me see.

224
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,440
Hey, Soo-bin.

225
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:05,899
My stomach...

226
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,319
Why? Are you sick?

227
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:12,573
I don't know. I have a stomachache.

228
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,116
Again? There you go again.

229
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,243
Just when you have to
start studying again.

230
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,705
Did you hear you have to go to
Hwi-yeong's place by five tomorrow?

231
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,415
Yes, I know.

232
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,168
Hey, Soo-bin.

233
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:29,214
Do you know that my insides
are literally churning right now?

234
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,050
That sneaky rat...

235
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,844
No, because Hwi-yeong's mom
trampled on my pride.

236
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,930
Soo-bin, don't disappoint me
this time, okay?

237
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,557
-Okay.
-Do you understand?

238
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,942
Hello? Little Pea!

239
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,571
Soo-bin?

240
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,740
Jun-u. Did you have fun?

241
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:55,866
Yes, Mom.

242
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,036
How was the school trip? Was it fun?

243
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,454
Yes, it was fun.

244
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,624
Look at you.
Something good must've happened.

245
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:08,170
It's written on your face.
"I am very happy right now."

246
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:09,838
No, I'm not.

247
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,591
I guess it went well with her.

248
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,135
-Her?
-I already knew

249
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,721
when you asked me
about my first love last time.

250
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,723
Who is it? Someone in your class?

251
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,059
You guys hooked up on
the school trip, didn't you?

252
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,186
How? Tell me.

253
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,063
Come on, tell me.

254
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,941
-I don't know.
-Please, tell me!

255
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,735
-I don't know.
-No, you can't go in!

256
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:32,945
Tell me now.

257
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,489
-What?
-Let's talk inside.

258
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,950
I'm going home now. Bye.

259
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,743
Mr. Oh, my shift...

260
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,703
is over.

261
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,092
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

262
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,893
It must be tough for you too.

263
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,772
Is that why you cried so much last time?

264
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,441
Well, yes.

265
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:15,529
You should be brave. Go up against her!

266
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:18,824
But I have a tendency
to become super timid

267
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,868
at critical moments.

268
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,369
Don't be like that.

269
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,789
I heard from Jun-u that you're
the best teacher in the world.

270
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:30,335
No matter what the moms say,
your students will be on your side.

271
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:33,297
Believe them, and believe in yourself.

272
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,048
You should be brave, okay?

273
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:39,678
Ji-min, do I seem like
a good teacher to you?

274
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,306
Are you kidding me?

275
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,602
If I met a teacher like you
when I was in school,

276
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,812
I wouldn't have ended up like this.

277
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,941
Then you can meet me now.

278
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:54,776
What?

279
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,238
I mean, you and I can meet.

280
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,866
Let's go out.

281
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,077
Well, that's...

282
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,998
We've only met a couple of times.

283
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:10,918
Come on, numbers don't mean anything.

284
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:14,546
I felt it from the moment
I first laid eyes on you.

285
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,548
What about you, Ji-min?

286
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,426
See? I think you felt the same.

287
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:23,138
Wait, didn't you say you were super timid?

288
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:24,556
Why are you suddenly...

289
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,516
Of course not, I'm a man!

290
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,144
Then, let's...

291
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,855
go out.

292
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,982
From this moment on.

293
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,151
Okay?

294
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:38,904
Well...

295
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,322
Okay.

296
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:41,907
Really?

297
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,743
Really? Are you serious?
You're not lying, are you?

298
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,454
We're really going out now, right?

299
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:48,830
We're going out.

300
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,468
-Yes! Nice!
-You did it!

301
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:02,678
Yes!

302
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,728
He told us to go straight home.

303
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,524
I have an orientation
with the tutor at 5 p.m. tomorrow.

304
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:20,696
Really? Then I guess
I can only see you briefly.

305
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,906
Yes, I guess so.

306
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,117
Shall we meet earlier, then?

307
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,745
I'd love that,
but will that be okay with you?

308
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,082
About an hour early? How's 8 a.m.?

309
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,877
I can meet even earlier.

310
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,838
Will you be too tired?

311
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,426
Then how about 7:30 a.m.?

312
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,470
-Will you be okay?
-Yes, of course.

313
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,350
I mean, yes. I think so.

314
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,437
Then can we meet a little...

315
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,189
earlier than 7:30 a.m.?

316
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,277
Earlier? How early?

317
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,201
How about we meet...

318
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,662
at 7:24 a.m.?

319
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,658
What's gotten into you?

320
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,203
-Going to the library this early?
-Yes.

321
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,080
I guess you're nervous
about the orientation.

322
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:53,997
Yes.

323
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,750
Mom, you have to go to work today?
It's Saturday.

324
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,503
Right? I'll come home early
so that I can to go to Hwi-yeong's place.

325
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:00,420
You're coming too?

326
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,881
Of course. I went through hoops
to snag this opportunity.

327
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,051
See you later.

328
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,011
Have a good day. Study hard.

329
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:09,888
I will.

330
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,309
I'm sorry, Mom.

331
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,470
-Oh, this one is the same too.
-Yes.

332
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:51,847
This one too.

333
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,895
What shall we do first?

334
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:00,647
Well...

335
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,776
There are no good movies
playing at the moment,

336
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,029
and we don't have enough time
to go to an amusement park today.

337
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,576
Then...

338
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,496
let's both say what we want to do
the most on the count of three.

339
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,581
Okay.

340
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:19,916
In one, two, three.

341
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,209
-Number One.
-Doing nothing.

342
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,171
What was Number One?

343
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:30,135
Then we can do both of them.

344
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,386
You're right.

345
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,722
-Let's go.
-Okay.

346
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,229
-Hello.
-My gosh.

347
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,524
Yeon-u, I thought you weren't
going to do this anymore.

348
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:48,445
I checked your schedule and saw
you have another busy day today.

349
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:49,946
Don't you have to go pretty far?

350
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,073
It's okay. I can just take a cab.

351
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,538
Then please take this.

352
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,835
You overpaid me for the work I did.

353
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,338
I can't accept this.

354
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:07,964
Just accept it, please.

355
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,926
You made kimchi for me
and even brought lunch.

356
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,386
You did more than enough,
so please just accept this.

357
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:16,723
I don't want to take advantage
of anyone. Take it, please.

358
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:21,645
Do you only think about yourself?

359
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,730
I don't want to take
advantage of anyone either.

360
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,982
I know you hired me,

361
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,902
but I did all those things
because I genuinely wanted to.

362
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,570
You always skip meals,

363
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,240
and you're too busy with work
to do any housework.

364
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:36,701
I felt bad for you,
so I wanted to help out a little.

365
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:41,248
Sister, how could you pay me
for genuinely wanting to help you?

366
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,458
You're too compassionate.

367
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,294
Also, why are you calling me "Sister"?

368
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,630
Then what?
Shall I call you "Brother" instead?

369
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,520
So, is this how we do it? Doing nothing.

370
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,107
It's boring, isn't it?

371
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,234
No, it's nice.

372
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,444
I like how the scenery keeps changing.

373
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,203
What do you think about this seat?

374
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:24,165
I like it. I can see everything from here.

375
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,629
When I was little, I had to
take buses like this very often

376
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,298
to go see my mom.

377
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,216
And,

378
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,845
whenever I sat here because this seat
happened to be empty,

379
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,347
I was so happy.

380
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:45,353
I felt as if the bus was on the road
solely for me.

381
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,192
Just in that moment.

382
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,828
It does feel that way indeed.

383
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:24,267
I wanted to introduce you
to Jeong-hu before anybody else.

384
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,688
He would've been amazed

385
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:31,107
to find out that we're going out now.

386
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:41,701
Hi.

387
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:43,745
I'm Yoo Soo-bin.

388
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:47,540
As you can see, Jun-u is doing very well.

389
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,627
He's our class vice president
and very popular now.

390
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,837
And he even has a pretty girlfriend now.

391
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:09,521
So don't worry about him,
and rest in peace.

392
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,107
I'll look after him.

393
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,028
You'll look after me?

394
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:21,157
I have been looking after you.
I helped with your performance assessment,

395
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,326
and I scolded you
when you wanted to run away.

396
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:27,205
You know that I always want
to help out others too much.

397
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,545
That's why you helped me.

398
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:35,422
I thought you were interested in me.

399
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,881
You got the wrong idea.

400
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,053
I don't think I did.
You definitely seemed interested.

401
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,472
Look who's talking.

402
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,559
You came back using
the performance assessment as an excuse.

403
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:51,104
I just wanted to be responsible.
That's all.

404
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,662
Jeong-hu.

405
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,498
Don't be sorry for me anymore.

406
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:15,837
I'm doing well.

407
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:17,881
I'm happy.

408
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:35,273
Your mother married her first love?

409
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:38,276
I guess it can really happen.

410
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:39,861
It's like a fairy tale.

411
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,448
But not one with a happy ending
as it didn't exactly work out.

412
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,410
She had me, so she struggled a lot.

413
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,794
I doubt that. I'm sure she was happy

414
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,380
because her son, Choe Jun-u, was born.

415
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:08,723
Right.

416
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,725
I wanted to ask you something.

417
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,227
What is it?

418
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,689
When did it start?

419
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:22,237
From which moment did you start liking me?

420
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:29,327
Goodness. You're so certain now
that I like you, aren't you?

421
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,580
Am I wrong?

422
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:34,874
But I can feel it.

423
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,885
When we practiced
for the English free-talking test?

424
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:49,597
I thought you were transferring again,

425
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,641
but you came back.

426
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:57,647
For me, it was that day.

427
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,200
I suddenly feel embarrassed to tell you.

428
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,704
Why? Which day was it?

429
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,081
Which day?

430
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,433
I think it was that day for me too.

431
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:40,356
What is it?

432
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,358
You can't concentrate?

433
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,360
No.

434
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:47,822
You need to stay alert.

435
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:51,117
I heard Jo Sang-hun from Class One
didn't transfer.

436
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,620
Your dad isn't someone who lets
something like that slide.

437
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,538
I don't know what he's thinking.

438
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:57,916
Eat this and study hard.

439
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,584
Mom.

440
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,544
About Soo-bin.

441
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:02,879
Yes?

442
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,633
I think we should pull her
out of the private lesson team.

443
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:09,344
Why? Did Soo-bin ask you to do that?

444
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,639
Does she feel guilty
for being favored all the time?

445
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,557
Gosh, how could she be so inflexible

446
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:17,143
for a young little girl?

447
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,729
Do you know how much her mom begged me?

448
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,064
It's not that.

449
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,567
I just think it'll be
more comfortable with just guys.

450
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,528
Son.

451
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:30,823
You don't like Soo-bin anymore, right?

452
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:31,908
What?

453
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,535
Then you can pull yourself together

454
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,121
and focus fully on your studies, right?

455
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,874
What a wise decision, my son!

456
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:43,169
Your condition seemed to
improve because of Soo-bin,

457
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:46,214
so that's why I didn't say anything
even if I didn't like her.

458
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,758
Then there's no need anymore, right?

459
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:52,887
What do you mean?

460
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,514
Why so suddenly...

461
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:55,974
Hello?

462
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,560
Seriously, that rat... What do I do?

463
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,728
Rat?

464
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,230
What's going on?

465
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,693
Can you turn the car around?

466
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,319
-What?
-Make a U-turn now.

467
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,570
-Okay.
-Hurry.

468
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,128
Ms. Park.

469
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,338
Ms. Park.

470
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,465
Ms. Yoon, what brings you here?

471
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,300
What is this about?

472
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,344
Why did you suddenly
take Soo-bin out of the team?

473
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,138
Well, I gave it some thought,

474
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,597
and Soo-bin's grades

475
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,975
seem too low for her to be
in the same private class.

476
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,602
She only missed the top tier in math.

477
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,771
You said you'd make a special exception.

478
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,440
Ms. Yoon.

479
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,526
I'm not fond of things like

480
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:51,029
special requests or favors.

481
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,989
You know I like to keep things clean.

482
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,199
I have an appointment.

483
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,702
-Wait, ma'am...
-What are you doing?

484
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,081
Hello.

485
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,207
Yes.

486
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,794
Ma'am. There's another reason,
isn't there, ma'am?

487
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,796
Stop calling me like that.

488
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,507
Honestly,
that's bothered me all this time.

489
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:15,303
I understand that you want to flatter me,

490
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,888
but we're all moms here.

491
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:19,307
There's no need to be excessively polite.

492
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,309
You should have some self-respect.

493
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,644
You even graduated from
a prestigious university.

494
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,357
Hey.

495
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,486
Shouldn't you apologize to her?

496
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,696
You even made her drop her purse.

497
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:38,117
Since when did you two become friends?

498
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,913
It's been a while.

499
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,832
So you came all the way here together?

500
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,667
I envy your friendship.

501
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:48,669
Wait...

502
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,631
Anyway, I hope you apologize to her later.

503
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,508
Let's go, Ms. Yoon.

504
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,430
What's up with those two?

505
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:17,782
It's a gift.

506
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,539
My first gift as your boyfriend.

507
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:27,959
What is this?

508
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,922
Wow, it smells nice.

509
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,968
Jun-u, you even know how to buy gifts?

510
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:40,346
I guess.

511
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,432
I didn't know I'd be like this either.

512
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,606
Thank you for accepting my feelings.

513
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,407
This was exactly what you looked like.

514
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,577
The first time we met
in front of the school.

515
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:11,252
You too. You looked just like this.

516
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:26,142
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have butted in.

517
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,229
Thank you.

518
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,858
For what? I wasn't being helpful.

519
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,485
I know, but I still feel thankful.

520
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,533
I don't know why.

521
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:51,876
So are you implying that

522
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:54,337
I was the one who started

523
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,547
that petition?

524
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,467
Ma'am.

525
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:03,095
If it's because there's something
that bothers you,

526
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,389
you can be frank with me.

527
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,850
Bother me? What are you talking about?

528
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:11,020
Are you saying we fabricated grades...

529
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,150
or something like that?

530
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:19,904
Mr. Oh. You are aware
that this is a very serious

531
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:22,782
matter of defamation, right?

532
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:24,617
I didn't say anything about...

533
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,871
I didn't say anything about
fabricating grades, ma'am.

534
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,919
I just said that as an example.

535
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:38,256
Including Question 15
of the math test last time,

536
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,968
it's true that there is something
fishy going on, isn't it?

537
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:47,556
I beg you, for Hwi-yeong's sake...

538
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,641
Mr. Oh.

539
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,769
Are you saying you want to
go up against us?

540
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,854
Is that why you're digging around

541
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,231
here and there lately?

542
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,149
That's not what I meant.

543
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,904
I just want to set things right
if there's something wrong.

544
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,745
So what? Did Oh Han-gyeol
find out anything?

545
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,706
It seems so.

546
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,207
I'm not sure.

547
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,419
Unlike his looks, Mr. Oh is

548
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,129
quite a smart man.

549
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,047
I don't know what to do.

550
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:22,883
What should we do?

551
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,344
What do you think?
We'll do what we always do.

552
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,680
Make sure Hwi-yeong doesn't find out.

553
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,598
He's already mentally unstable.

554
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,980
Later. The kids will arrive soon.

555
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,190
Suddenly?

556
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:41,527
I don't know why she suddenly
changed her attitude.

557
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:46,574
Come sit over here.

558
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:52,121
Did you do something to offend Hwi-yeong?

559
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:53,205
What?

560
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:55,916
No.

561
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,712
You should've been nice to him.

562
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,630
Everything is ruined now.

563
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,799
Gosh, that sneaky rat.

564
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,676
I'm sure

565
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,846
it was her inferiority complex talking.
Seriously.

566
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,182
Why in the world do I have to hear

567
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:14,143
something like that from her
because of you?

568
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:18,314
Mom, I wasn't qualified to join
that team in the first place.

569
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:21,692
You keep forcing things
that aren't possible,

570
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:24,403
and that's why bad things keep happening.

571
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:27,990
Just leave it up to me.

572
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:32,119
I'm not as smart as you,

573
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:36,499
but still, I'm trying my best on my own.

574
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:41,128
Look at you talking.

575
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,091
Are you boxing or what?

576
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,760
Trust me. I can do it!

577
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:49,345
-Hello.
-Hi.

578
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,555
-Hello.
-Come on in, guys.

579
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,474
-Hi, Sim-bok.
-Hello.

580
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,810
Only today's session will be done here.

581
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,354
Starting from next session,
you'll be meeting at the apartment.

582
00:39:58,437 --> 00:39:59,688
Remember that, okay?

583
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,149
-Okay, thank you.
-Thank you.

584
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,193
-Hey.
-Guys, you're here.

585
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,612
-Where's Gi-tae?
-He can't make it.

586
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,906
-I think he's sick.
-Really?

587
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:15,162
-Aren't you...
-Hello, ma'am.

588
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,248
Hey, Sang-hun. Welcome.

589
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,375
Hello, sir.

590
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:21,919
Honey.

591
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:25,131
My, what a nice place.

592
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,382
Gosh, is this real?

593
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,969
Oh, my!

594
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:35,015
Honey, I get it. But don't you think
this is too harsh?

595
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,394
Do you agree with your mom?

596
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:42,273
Do you know what it's like

597
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:43,691
to get to the top?

598
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,610
You must compete fiercely
like a vicious beast.

599
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,363
Only one person who survives
that battle until the end

600
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,782
can get to the top.

601
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,244
He's very clever.
You should compete against him.

602
00:40:57,204 --> 00:41:00,416
Honey. Then like last time,
Hwi-yeong will...

603
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:03,210
If he can't get through this,
he won't survive the competition.

604
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:04,879
Like my brother?

605
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:11,385
What are you talking about?
He's so successful now.

606
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,970
I wish you were like him.

607
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,513
Don't worry, Dad.

608
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,224
I'll win.

609
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:19,810
I will survive.

610
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,447
My gosh. Thanks, Hwi-yeong.

611
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,449
I got to visit this mansion thanks to you.

612
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,201
Thank you.

613
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:38,329
-Can I ask you for a favor?
-Of course. Anything.

614
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:41,707
Don't put on an act in front of me.

615
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,919
Just be your usual self.

616
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:46,795
Your greedy, sly self.

617
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:53,511
Come on. What are you talking about?
This is how I always am.

618
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,388
I need to use the bathroom.
Where's the bathroom?

619
00:41:58,557 --> 00:41:59,683
Hwi-yeong.

620
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,520
Don't provoke me.

621
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,106
You'll get hurt.

622
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:13,656
Hey, Gi-tae. Are you very sick?

623
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,911
I'll upload all the notes
from the tutoring session.

624
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,329
Thanks.

625
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:30,673
I doubt that.

626
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,508
I'm sure she was happy

627
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,010
because her son, Choe Jun-u, was born.

628
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:12,715
My gosh!

629
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:19,305
-Have you been waiting long?
-No, let's go.

630
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,098
Where's Bumbi?

631
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:22,433
At home.

632
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:23,892
I wanted to walk with you.

633
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:26,687
Bumbi must be sad.

634
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:28,981
It's a love triangle.

635
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,483
Let's go.

636
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:51,837
Why let go? Keep holding hands.

637
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,255
It looked lovely.

638
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,883
Let's go.

639
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,427
Then I shall...

640
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:00,804
Let's go.

641
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:03,807
Hi.

642
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,977
Gosh, you're so thick-skinned.

643
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:09,146
-Hi.
-Hi.

644
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:11,940
Soo-bin, I heard you got kicked out
of Hwi-yeong's tutoring team.

645
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:15,653
-No, I didn't get kicked out.
-What else would you call it, then?

646
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,863
Didn't Hwi-yeong say
he doesn't want you in the team?

647
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,615
That's what Gi-tae's mom said.

648
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,408
Ro-mi, you're so sneaky.

649
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,869
Did you peek at the moms' chatroom
on your mom's phone again?

650
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:26,914
Right, Hwi-yeong must think
you're out of his league now.

651
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,541
Because you ended up with him.

652
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,880
Hey, you little... Ro-mi! Hey!

653
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:36,757
You're one tough cookie.

654
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,053
You sure are the Hwang Ro-mi I know.

655
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:45,641
Let's go, guys. Come on. Let's go.

656
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,393
Don't mind her.

657
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:55,859
Why didn't you tell me?

658
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:57,736
About the tutoring team.

659
00:44:58,695 --> 00:45:00,030
Because it's not important.

660
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,658
I'm happy that
I don't have to do it anymore.

661
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:07,704
Jun-u, I can see right through you.

662
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:10,499
I know you're worried that it might
be because we're going out now.

663
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:21,093
I can still see you.

664
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,597
I can still see you.

665
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,441
Gosh, just get your books.

666
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:36,650
Did you have breakfast?

667
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,444
No, I didn't.

668
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:42,573
Then how about we go to the snack bar
during the break?

669
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:44,283
Okay.

670
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:50,122
Hey, Hwi-yeong.

671
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:52,624
You two should talk.

672
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:04,386
Even Sang-hun joined the team,
so there are too many people now.

673
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,721
Sang-hun too?

674
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,973
Thank goodness
I'm not in the team anymore.

675
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,809
It would've been hard for me
as you guys are all so smart.

676
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,771
I asked my mom
to pull you out of the team.

677
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:18,984
I thought seeing you at every session
would be too hard for me.

678
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,529
But it doesn't make me feel better.

679
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:33,540
Hi, Ji-min. Did you have a good sleep?

680
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,460
Did you dream about me?

681
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:39,379
Seriously?

682
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:42,132
I was just joking, but you actually did?

683
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:44,134
My gosh, thank you

684
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:45,969
for seeing me even in your dream.

685
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,139
Oh, okay. Study hard.

686
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,058
I'll message you whenever I can.

687
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:53,185
Okay, all right.

688
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,271
-Mr. Oh.
-Gosh!

689
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:58,524
You have a girlfriend now, don't you?

690
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:01,818
Yes. Did you see her?

691
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,071
What do you think?

692
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:08,075
You two looked so lovely together.

693
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:12,120
She's beautiful, and she seemed very kind.

694
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:18,252
Right? I guess I got lucky
because of all the good deeds I did.

695
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:24,925
Chan-yeol, do a tarot card reading
for my love life later. Okay?

696
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:26,969
Sure.

697
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:51,994
Gosh.

698
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:53,996
Da-huin.

699
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:07,926
What's going on?

700
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:13,724
Guys, feel free to take
this printout if you need one.

701
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:30,657
I've decided not to take
the tutoring sessions.

702
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,034
Why?

703
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:37,164
The thing is, I can't afford
such an expensive tutor,

704
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,749
but you just let me join for free.

705
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,501
It just makes me uncomfortable.

706
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,546
Hey. We're friends,
so we should study together.

707
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:45,756
Even if we're friends,

708
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:47,966
this seems wrong.

709
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:54,389
I'll just find something I can afford.

710
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:59,770
Are you saying you won't be
my friend anymore?

711
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,439
It's not that.

712
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:05,025
I just feel more comfortable
taking care of it on my own.

713
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:08,528
Fine. Suit yourself.

714
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:11,698
But I won't share my test notes with you
from now on.

715
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,242
And you'll be kicked out
of our study group cafe.

716
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,085
Hurry up before my face gets sunburned.

717
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:25,921
You skipped your meals again, right?

718
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,465
Your face looks haggard.

719
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,759
I won't accept your apology.

720
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,136
I kept so many things
bottled up all this time.

721
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,806
You don't have to say things like
"I'm sorry, forgive me."

722
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,724
Bye.

723
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:40,018
Da-huin, can we...

724
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:49,486
Can we go back
to being friends like before?

725
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:55,033
To be honest, I just wish...

726
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,121
you could be my good friend...

727
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:02,040
instead of my girlfriend.

728
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,797
I tried my best...

729
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,096
but it's hard.

730
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:18,807
Being your boyfriend.

731
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,479
You're so kind to me,

732
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:26,982
but I can't be the same,
and I always feel sorry,

733
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:28,984
and I don't know what to do.

734
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:31,611
It's not like there's another reason.

735
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,364
It's not like there's someone else
or you're not attractive.

736
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:35,615
-It's not that...
-Hey.

737
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,285
Stop talking.

738
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,206
Why are you talking so much suddenly?

739
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:46,126
All this time,
when I said a thousand words,

740
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,920
all you did was smile and say one word.

741
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:52,799
Are you being generous now?

742
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,510
Since you have to dump me?

743
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,474
How could you make me look so pitiful?

744
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:03,602
Da-huin.

745
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:24,956
In the classroom.

746
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:31,421
After school today,

747
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,217
I have two hours to spare.

748
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,930
Oh, okay. I have time too.

749
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,433
Do you want to go get something to drink?

750
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,728
Something sweet?

751
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:52,651
That place, after school?

752
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,301
What has changed for you

753
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:20,303
since we started going out?

754
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:28,812
The world seems...

755
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:32,732
Not some cliche like
"The world seems different."

756
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:44,202
I keep looking in the mirror.

757
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:49,875
Me too.

758
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:51,459
Why?

759
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:55,672
You're handsome.
You don't have to look in the mirror.

760
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:57,716
I know.

761
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:01,386
I'm joking.

762
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:09,728
When I look into the mirror lately,

763
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:12,439
my reflection looks so excited.

764
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,483
It wasn't like that before.

765
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:20,322
So whether it was a mirror
or a glass wall,

766
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:23,033
I tried not to look on purpose.

767
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:27,120
But these days, it's amazing
how much I've changed.

768
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:32,000
You know, right?

769
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:33,668
Know what?

770
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:36,296
That you're...

771
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:38,673
really...

772
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:41,676
pretty.

773
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:43,261
What?

774
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:44,512
That you're pretty.

775
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:47,766
What did you say? I can't hear you.

776
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:49,517
That you're getting prettier.

777
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:54,606
Wasn't I always pretty?

778
00:53:58,485 --> 00:53:59,819
You always were,

779
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:04,324
but lately, you seem to get even prettier

780
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:05,909
every single day.

781
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:08,161
And I

782
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:10,288
miss you more.

783
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:13,500
And also,

784
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,379
I keep wanting to know more about you.

785
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:19,839
Like what?

786
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,176
It's nothing much.

787
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:26,763
"What does Soo-bin

788
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:29,975
look like when she sneezes?

789
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:34,604
Does Soo-bin sleep
with her knees curled up?

790
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:36,356
Does she lie on her side?

791
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:38,191
Or does she raise her arms?"

792
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:42,529
And also...

793
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:45,073
I thought of things like that too.

794
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:51,579
"Does Jun-u really have trouble
sleeping with the lights off?"

795
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:55,417
I guess you can sleep
with the lights off lately

796
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,668
since your mom's with you.

797
00:54:57,502 --> 00:54:58,628
Also...

798
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:01,965
"When Jun-u smiles,

799
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:04,634
does he know that his left eye
gets smaller?"

800
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:06,594
It does?

801
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,639
-No, it doesn't.
-It does.

802
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:12,058
Try smiling properly.

803
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:15,645
Hey. You're squinting your right eye

804
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:17,313
on purpose, aren't you?

805
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:18,940
-On purpose.
-No, I'm not.

806
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:21,026
Who smiles like that?

807
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:22,694
Open them properly.

808
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:24,738
What are you doing?

809
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:35,832
And when I'm with you,

810
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:38,001
everything feels comfortable.

811
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:41,838
Like all the troubles in this world
have disappeared.

812
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,426
It's so hot.

813
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,012
On days like this,
after washing your hair,

814
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:52,307
if you stick your head outside
the window, it feels so refreshing.

815
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:56,352
The cold breeze blows through your hair,

816
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,271
and it feels like someone is blowing.

817
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:05,153
It must feel like someone is
stroking your hair.

818
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:08,698
Right.

819
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:13,578
But you can't do it in winter.

820
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:17,332
Your hair will freeze.

821
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:20,460
You know, like when it's been hit
by lightning.

822
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:22,879
I do get taller.

823
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:25,507
But it doesn't work in winter.

824
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:28,551
Of course not.
That's not your real height.

825
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:31,387
I know.

826
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:38,144
By the way, isn't it about time

827
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,480
that you need to go to work?

828
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:42,816
I still have 30 minutes left.

829
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,400
Shall I walk you to the store?

830
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:47,278
Sure.

831
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:52,033
Then let me stop by my house
for a second before we go.

832
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,159
Okay.

833
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:04,170
Why am I hiccupping suddenly?

834
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:23,982
Did I surprise you?

835
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:26,234
Yes.

836
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:28,027
Let's go.

837
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:34,868
Wait, I left my phone at home.

838
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,494
My mom said she'd call later.

839
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:39,247
You're so clumsy. Go get it.

840
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:40,874
I'll be right back.

841
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:47,505
Are you okay?

842
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:49,757
Yes, I'm fine. It'll stop soon.

843
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:59,559
Why don't you come inside for some water?

844
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:03,188
It's okay. It'll probably stop.

845
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,900
Don't worry. My mom is at work now.

846
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:08,026
We talked on the phone.

847
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:09,903
Come inside for some water.

848
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,342
Come on in. Get some water.

849
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:35,428
Just get me a cup of water.

850
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,598
No one's here. It's okay.

851
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:43,186
All right, fine.

852
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:52,403
-Here.
-Thanks.

853
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,370
What are you doing?

854
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,207
This gets rid of hiccups.

855
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,668
I see. So has it stopped?

856
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,962
-Yes.
-Nice.

857
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:12,382
Have some more water.
I'll go get my phone.

858
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:18,012
Hey! Hey, hurry.

859
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:20,348
Come over here!

860
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:48,167
Oh, it must be our housekeeper.

861
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:04,350
It's okay. It's all good. We're okay now.

862
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:11,065
Jun-u.

863
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:14,861
Mom.

864
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:44,182
By the way, what happened, Mom?

865
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:47,769
Are you uncomfortable with it?

866
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:50,438
I'm fine if you're okay with it.

867
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:51,939
Someone posted something strange.

868
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:53,816
The rumors about rigged grades
aren't true, right?

869
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:54,901
What do you guys think?

870
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:55,985
I trust you.

871
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:58,363
Even if something unexpected did happen,

872
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:01,658
I'm sure you wouldn't have
anything to do with it.

873
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:02,784
Aren't I right?

874
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:04,202
You understand everything, right?

875
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:05,745
No, Dad.

876
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:07,830
I just acted mature, that's all.

877
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:09,957
I had to react that way

878
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,752
to make it easier for you and Mom.

879
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:15,338
Something must've upset you
when you met your dad earlier.

880
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:17,924
What is the one thing you regret
the most in your life?

881
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:19,634
Not being able to tell him that it was me.

882
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:21,469
Let's go there again and tell him.

883
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:24,222
I hope all your regrets are gone now.

884
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:25,473
It's not your fault.

885
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:27,767
You didn't know back then.

886
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,644
You thought that was for the best then.

887
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:32,105
What are you guys doing?
