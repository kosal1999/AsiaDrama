1
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,466
I like you.

2
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,898
I like you too.

3
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:10,820
I like you.

4
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,614
What...

5
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,282
Jun-u...

6
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:15,742
I like you.

7
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,917
-That's hot!
-Are you okay?

8
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,586
What is wrong with this?

9
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:50,819
Soo-bin.

10
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:53,696
Are you okay?

11
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,367
Yes. I'm feeling better now
after taking medicine.

12
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,037
What about the test?

13
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,666
I finished it. In here with Jun-u.

14
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:14,551
I'm sorry. I wanted to bring you
to the nurse's office.

15
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,137
Don't worry, that's fine.

16
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,806
If you got a question wrong because of me,
I'd have to leave school.

17
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,516
Your mom will kill me.

18
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,977
Come on. That's not true.

19
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,065
Thanks, Jun-u.

20
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:30,900
You can go now.

21
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,973
-Ma'am, his hand--
-Ma'am, her hand--

22
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,533
I'm sorry.

23
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:40,970
Mom.

24
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,015
Hello, ma'am.

25
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:47,810
Soo-bin suddenly had stomach cramps
during the exam.

26
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:48,895
I heard.

27
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,942
Why did it have to happen
during your math exam?

28
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,027
She lost a lot of time because of it.

29
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,947
So it must've been hard
for her to focus on the exam.

30
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,157
It's such an important exam.

31
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,825
Why math of all exams?

32
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,285
What should we do now?

33
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,790
Hwi-yeong. My gosh, I'm sorry.

34
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,251
Did you ruin your exam because of Soo-bin?

35
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,419
It wasn't me.

36
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,005
He carried Soo-bin here.

37
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,594
Thank you.

38
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,934
Then did you come here after the exam?

39
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,687
Good. You did the right thing.

40
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,231
My goodness.

41
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,482
Hello.

42
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,150
-Are you all right, Soo-bin?
-Yes.

43
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,820
I couldn't come sooner
because I had to supervise the exam.

44
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,699
-Oh. Hello, ma'am.
-Hello.

45
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,242
Mr. Oh, what do we do?

46
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,619
I'm not sure.

47
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,997
What about the time she lost
on her way here from the classroom?

48
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,208
It's not like she wanted to fall ill.
That should be taken into consideration.

49
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,545
I know she took the exam here,
but I'm sure she couldn't focus.

50
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,090
This is crazy.
It's such an important exam.

51
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,134
I'll make sure she's not put
at a disadvantage...

52
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,885
Are there rules for situations like this?

53
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,471
I'm not sure. I'll have to look into it.

54
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,890
-But you said you'll make sure...
-Let's talk outside, Mom.

55
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,100
Were you able to focus?

56
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:11,102
-Yes, I... I tried my best.
-Gosh, okay.

57
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,812
-Thank you.
-I'm sure she couldn't focus.

58
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,064
What should we do?
What can we do about this?

59
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,774
-The exam is already over.
-Let's go, Mom.

60
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,694
Gosh, I heard you! Yoo Soo-bin.

61
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,613
You seem totally fine.
Did you actually feel sick?

62
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,198
Why don't we talk outside?

63
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,075
-Let's go talk outside.
-All right.

64
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,327
Are you all right?

65
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:40,048
Ma'am, did you get an appointment
for a checkup at such short notice?

66
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,507
Yes.

67
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,552
My friend from Seoul National University
runs the clinic.

68
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:51,017
I'd like her to go through
her answers before we leave.

69
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:52,935
Don't worry about that.

70
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,063
I'll send you the answer sheet
as soon as it's out.

71
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,523
I'm going to go through the answers now.

72
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,942
Oh, right. We have Hwi-yeong.

73
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,694
He always gets a perfect score
on every exam.

74
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,279
You should do it for her.

75
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,658
Okay, then.

76
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,045
-Soo-bin! Are you all right?
-Soo-bin.

77
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,713
-Hey.
-We were so worried.

78
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,760
I wondered why I kept getting
the Moon card.

79
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,805
I always get this card when I have
a bad feeling about something.

80
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,306
She's at it again.

81
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,392
She talks like an expert, doesn't she?

82
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,104
Hey, can't you predict these things
before they happen?

83
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,480
Guys, let's go.

84
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,482
Hey.

85
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,820
Let's go over the answers
for the math exam before we clean.

86
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,655
We can go into detail together later.

87
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,701
Goodness, what a diligent class president.
What's the rush?

88
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,287
I mean, we should do it.

89
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,622
Okay, let's have a look.

90
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,999
Question 1 was easy, right?
The answer is number 3.

91
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,168
-Gosh, I got it wrong.
-I got it wrong.

92
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,130
Number 3 for Question 2.

93
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,216
-Number 3?
-Number 4 for Question 3.

94
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,345
-What's the answer to Question 3?
-Number 4.

95
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,847
Focus, guys.

96
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,683
What was that? What's the answer?

97
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,685
-Number 1 for Question 4.
-Okay!

98
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,937
Number 2 for Question 5. Next...

99
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,982
Mr. Oh, I think I've seen that boy
somewhere before.

100
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:24,026
His name is Jun-u. He transferred
to our school recently.

101
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,862
The one who was forced to transfer, right?

102
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,155
Well, that's...

103
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,950
No, it was just a regular transfer.

104
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,538
Jun-u, where are you going?

105
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,665
You don't want to know the answers?

106
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,878
I have to take care of this.

107
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,803
Why did a boy like that carry Soo-bin?

108
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,180
I mean, you were there too.

109
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,099
I was supervising the exam
in another classroom.

110
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,436
This can't happen.
Soo-bin can't be close to that boy now.

111
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,104
I mean, with the random draw too.

112
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,940
-Jun-u isn't a bad kid.
-He was forced to transfer here.

113
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,776
Mr. Oh, please keep
a watchful eye on those two.

114
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,361
Okay, I will.

115
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,989
I did as well as I had expected.

116
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,284
Well, Soo-bin seems to be okay now.

117
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,495
-Let's go sing some karaoke.
-Karaoke? Sounds good.

118
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,954
I did better than last time.

119
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,289
I scored about the same.

120
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,502
I really don't like math.

121
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,379
Soo-bin.

122
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,258
Did you get number 15 right?

123
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,261
No, I picked number one.

124
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,806
How many did you get wrong in total?

125
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,728
What? Soo-bin did much better
than you did.

126
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:44,815
Hey, Ro-mi. What was all the fuss about?

127
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,236
"Even Soo-bin passed the test.
How could I fail?

128
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,488
Gosh, I feel dizzy."

129
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,908
She took Son Jae-yeong's class!
He must've predicted all these questions.

130
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,493
All the questions are so dumb.

131
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,370
Come on, Ro-mi.

132
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,331
How could she say such a thing
to someone feeling sick?

133
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,457
Hey, Chan-yeol.

134
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,210
Gosh, what the...

135
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,922
-Watch your mouth, will you?
-Mind your own business.

136
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,384
Pil-sang, be quiet.

137
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,120
He carried Soo-bin here.

138
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,707
Thank you.

139
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,592
Did you get this one wrong too?

140
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,468
This too? Even such an easy question?

141
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,846
Hey, even I can solve that question.

142
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,933
How will you get into the top tier
at this rate? It won't happen now.

143
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,060
Why did you quit Mr. Son's math class?

144
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,478
What makes you so confident?

145
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,274
Mom, you're more worried
about the exam than me feeling sick.

146
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,985
Stomach cramps go away
if you take medicine.

147
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,070
It's not like you have
a terminal illness, Soo-bin.

148
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,448
You really need to make yourself
mentally stronger.

149
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:19,493
How will you survive in this
battlefield with that mentality?

150
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,829
I'm sorry that I'm mentally weak.

151
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:28,461
Hey, I heard the boy who carried you
is a troublemaker.

152
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:29,837
Jun-u isn't a troublemaker.

153
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,256
Anyway, it's the boy
who was forced to transfer here.

154
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,675
The handsome boy we saw
in front of the academy, right?

155
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,178
He was with that young woman
who seemed to be his mom or aunt.

156
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,472
She had a knockoff purse.
It's that boy, right?

157
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,015
Why did he carry you earlier?

158
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,768
Why does he keep coming up?
Is something going on?

159
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,770
Are you interested in him
because of his looks?

160
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:48,856
-Don't you dare hang out with him.
-You got the wrong idea.

161
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,609
Don't even go anywhere near him.

162
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,819
You shouldn't befriend guys like him.

163
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,947
-Don't get close to him.
-We're just classmates, I swear.

164
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,407
Lower your voice.

165
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,624
The math exam was quite hard, right?

166
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,127
Even I found it pretty hard,
so don't be too discouraged.

167
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,505
I bet he got a perfect score again.

168
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,259
Let's do better on the final exam.
I'll help you guys.

169
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,471
Moving on. Oh, Question 15.

170
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:24,392
The math teacher
set up a trap in this question.

171
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:27,812
Hey, Hwi-yeong.

172
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:31,440
Did you tell my classmates that
the answer to Question 15 is number 4?

173
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,609
Hey, how could it be the number 4?

174
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,653
Number 4 is the correct answer.

175
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,488
Hold on a second.

176
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,781
Sang-hun, this is so unlike you.

177
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:39,990
You fell for the trap.

178
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:44,662
No, you're the one who fell for the trap.

179
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:48,416
If you do this...

180
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,669
T squared is... nine T... minus K...

181
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,879
That means T is this.

182
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,590
And K equals zero.

183
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,094
See? You totally got tricked by this trap.

184
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,595
Hwi-yeong fell right into the trap.

185
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,182
In conclusion, K...

186
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,769
is included in zero.

187
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,229
Hence, the answer is number two.

188
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,982
You dummy. You idiot.

189
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:21,073
Mr. Son, can you solve
a math problem for me?

190
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,908
I'll be at the academy soon.
I'll call you back.

191
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:26,287
No. You have to solve it right now.
This instant.

192
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,538
I'm driving.

193
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:31,250
Okay. I'm pulling over
because of your enthusiasm for math.

194
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,759
Your teacher apparently made
the problem extra tricky

195
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,720
so that you guys would fall into his trap.

196
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:47,016
It can have different answers depending on
which aspect you base your solution on.

197
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,267
So which number is it?

198
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,644
Fine. Give me a second.

199
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,732
The answer is number two.

200
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:58,736
Are you sure?

201
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,656
That question was rude.

202
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,035
If T is a positive number
and larger than zero...

203
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,664
Damn it!

204
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,250
No!

205
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,086
In that case, it won't be finished
in the first half.

206
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,505
Which part is being delayed?

207
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,173
Okay.

208
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,807
Then I'll attend
the training session this time.

209
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:32,520
I like you too.

210
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,230
I like you.

211
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:38,692
Why isn't he doing anything
after saying that he likes me?

212
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:42,071
Could it be that it all happened
in my imagination?

213
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,406
This feels weird.

214
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,867
The whole thing feels so unreal.

215
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,869
You're done.

216
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,705
Hello?

217
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,874
So she doesn't have a disease or anything?

218
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,252
No. It's probably stress-related.

219
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,629
Cut your daughter some slack.

220
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,214
I am giving her enough slack.

221
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,757
It's just that she's too sensitive.

222
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,883
Excuse me for a second.

223
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,511
Hello, Director.

224
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,180
I can't believe your mom.

225
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,808
She's a little difficult, isn't she?

226
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,018
She was famous for being
a tough one back in our school days.

227
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,603
-Doctor.
-Yes?

228
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:15,980
Well...

229
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:21,402
Can an illness cause hallucinations,

230
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,322
delusions, or anything like that?

231
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,619
Get some rest today.

232
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,371
You failed to get
into the top tier in math,

233
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,290
so you have to listen to me
from now on, okay?

234
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,878
I have to get back. I'm swamped with work.

235
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,046
Eat the porridge.

236
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,132
Okay.

237
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,508
Thanks, Mom.

238
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,940
CHOE JUN-U

239
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,488
When you're under extreme stress,

240
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,574
you're mentally unstable,

241
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,784
which can cause confusing experiences.

242
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,995
For example, you can mix up

243
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,080
your wishes and reality.

244
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,126
That...

245
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,964
I did secretly wish
something like that would happen.

246
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,596
You're heavy.

247
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,307
You were so heavy when I was carrying you.

248
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,767
I thought I was going to break my back.

249
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,062
Right.

250
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,607
People only see what they want to see
and hear what they want to hear.

251
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,234
Was that self-justification?

252
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:48,197
It must've been self-justification
to forget the shame.

253
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,325
No. What about this?

254
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,078
-That's hot!
-Are you okay?

255
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,917
What happened? It's completely gone!

256
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,377
My gosh!

257
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,344
Soo-bin, are you home?

258
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,097
If you're feeling better, come over.

259
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,848
To our crazy after-exam party.

260
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,811
Gosh, I went overboard.

261
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,688
My stamina isn't what it used to be.

262
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,068
Soo-bin, what's with you today?

263
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,362
Is it because you failed
to get into the top tier in math?

264
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,364
So what? Forget it.

265
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,868
Did O-je leave?

266
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:35,995
Yes.

267
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,748
He has to help out at his dad's snack bar.

268
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,835
Guys, I have to go to the bathroom.

269
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,420
-So-ye.
-Yes?

270
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,546
Again?

271
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:49,341
Who would believe
this pretty girl has bowel problems?

272
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,634
What do you care?

273
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:58,475
Soo-bin, are you really not feeling well?

274
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,852
Do you want me to take you home?

275
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,027
Wipe harder.

276
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,654
Over there. Here too.

277
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,784
Do you see how much trouble

278
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:19,163
your mom caused us
while she filled in for you?

279
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,622
Do you?

280
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,375
She's too old for me to boss around,

281
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,210
so I had to do all the organizing

282
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,129
and carry all the heavy things.

283
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,590
My arm still aches.

284
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,341
She did her best.

285
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,635
Her legs were all swollen.

286
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,846
She used two packs of pain relief patches.

287
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:39,641
You punk. Do you have a problem? Do you?

288
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,687
You need a lesson. I'll call our boss

289
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,273
and tell him all the things
you've done wrong.

290
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,734
-Yes, I'm really calling him.
-No, wait.

291
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,110
I'm sorry.

292
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,279
Let me go organize the storage.

293
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,203
So you do have a conscience.

294
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:05,167
Eat first. You need energy.

295
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,986
You just can't stay out of trouble,
can you?

296
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,947
You're such a troublemaker.

297
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:46,125
Should I have talked to Soo-bin?

298
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,879
What is it now? Why are you frozen again?

299
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,593
Are you so touched
by the triangular gimbap?

300
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,138
You're so innocent.

301
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,055
Hey.

302
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,101
Well...

303
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,480
After telling someone that you like her...

304
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,190
Did you?

305
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,442
Who is she? Who?

306
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,444
It's not me.

307
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,322
There's this boy in my class.
His name is O-je.

308
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:18,949
He...

309
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,494
doesn't know what to do...

310
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:27,249
after telling a girl that he likes her.

311
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,418
How can he not know that?

312
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,295
It's so obvious.

313
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,715
Obvious? What should he do?

314
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,509
After telling a girl that you like her,

315
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,970
the next step is...

316
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,184
to kiss her.

317
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,978
-Someone said he likes you?
-To you?

318
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,104
-Who?
-Hwi-yeong?

319
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,982
Why would he? There's no need
for him to say that. It's obvious.

320
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,276
It's not me.

321
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,778
It's a friend of mine from middle school.

322
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,822
Middle school? Who?

323
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,741
Min-seo? Yu-ri?

324
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,910
No. It's someone you don't know.

325
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:08,332
Anyway, a guy told her he likes her.

326
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:13,378
But the guy hasn't called her since.
Nothing.

327
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,340
They didn't make plans to meet
or anything?

328
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:18,967
No.

329
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,678
But... I heard they had

330
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:25,432
a very hectic day at school or something.

331
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:26,725
What about a text message?

332
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,396
But... I also heard

333
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,066
that the guy is usually very busy.

334
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,526
Come on. No matter how busy he is,

335
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,778
that's wrong.

336
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,154
He just told her he liked her.

337
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,281
Right, it was their first day as a couple.

338
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,700
First day as a couple?

339
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,077
Of course.

340
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,705
After I asked O-je out,
we had pasta together that day.

341
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,290
Over there, at the mall.

342
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,377
Gosh, I already miss my O-je.

343
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,593
-It's you, isn't it?
-What?

344
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,180
-No.
-Come on, it seems like you.

345
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,431
No way!

346
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,517
I knew it, it is you.

347
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,435
It isn't! Seriously.

348
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,937
I was joking.

349
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,106
Of course, it isn't you.

350
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,861
What is Ro-mi doing?
She didn't even come to the karaoke bar.

351
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:23,782
She said she was going
to a luxury spa with her mom.

352
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,242
Hotel spa.

353
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,245
Of course, it isn't me.

354
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,874
Ro-mi, where are you?

355
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,460
I'm going to dinner with my mom
after the spa.

356
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,754
You guys can go ahead.

357
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,465
Okay. See you tomorrow.

358
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,730
-How much did you say it was?
-It's 2.5 million won a month.

359
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,481
It costs that much?

360
00:21:56,565 --> 00:22:00,027
It's a one-on-one coaching lesson
that includes consulting. That's why.

361
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,278
Would you like to enroll?

362
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,739
Let me think about it.

363
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,450
Why is it so expensive?

364
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,457
Dad.

365
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,418
-Why aren't you coming?
-I'm sorry, Ro-mi.

366
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:19,880
I have to drive the hospital director
to the countryside for urgent business.

367
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:20,964
Sorry.

368
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,010
What a terrible day.

369
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,360
MATH EXAM

370
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:47,949
Hwi-yeong,

371
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,035
you didn't go home yet?

372
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,497
Oh, that math problem?

373
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,250
I heard from your math teacher.

374
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,504
It's just one question.
Don't worry so much.

375
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:03,340
Since the test is over,
go home and get some rest.

376
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,217
One question?

377
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:09,179
My life may change over that one question.

378
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,765
Just one question?

379
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:17,062
Hey, man. Stop overreacting.

380
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,314
What do you mean, your life may change?

381
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:21,733
It's because you keep thinking that way

382
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,277
that your arm doesn't heal.
Do you know that?

383
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:27,572
You should know
how to let things go sometimes.

384
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,034
If you obsess about small things
like this, you won't get anything done.

385
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,661
What do you know?

386
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,580
You didn't graduate from
Seoul National University.

387
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,416
You didn't even go to a university
in Seoul.

388
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,211
What do you know?

389
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,514
Hey, Hwi-yeong. Ma Hwi--

390
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:53,765
Hey!

391
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,894
That punk has no manners at all.

392
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,438
Hey, Ma Hwi-yeong!

393
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,744
Where are you? Come home.

394
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,788
We need to come up with a plan
for your math score.

395
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:27,799
Trying to recall what happened again
and again makes me even more confused.

396
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,302
You should go and check
if it was real or not.

397
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,721
Go.

398
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,606
Good job today.

399
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,152
After telling someone that you like her,

400
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:48,778
don't think that's it.

401
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:52,073
You should kiss her
as a meaning of celebration,

402
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,576
or if that's difficult, you should

403
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,578
at least keep sending her messages.

404
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,580
To confirm that she accepts it.

405
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,167
"Hey, you. What I said just now,

406
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,877
I really meant it.

407
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:07,255
As of today, we're a couple.

408
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,507
Got it?" Something like this.

409
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:12,344
When a girl hears a guy say he likes her,

410
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,930
everything is suddenly
so out of this world to her.

411
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,681
"Is this real?

412
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,768
What if it's a dream?"
She becomes like that.

413
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,103
She starts to feel so confused
all of a sudden.

414
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,730
She literally loses her mind.

415
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:28,151
Soo-bin, what I said earlier...

416
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,531
Soo-bin, how are you feeling?

417
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,035
No, let's just ask straight out.

418
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:42,374
Soo-bin, what I said to you earlier
in the nurse's office...

419
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,049
I heard your bike's name is Bumbi.

420
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,010
Hi.

421
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,723
Can you give me a ride on Bumbi?

422
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,267
I feel so gloomy today.

423
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,523
I have a flat tire,
so it doesn't go properly.

424
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:07,774
I'm sorry. Bye.

425
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,819
Then can I borrow your
transportation card?

426
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:12,946
I left my wallet at school.

427
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,327
That won't work.

428
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:29,212
Jun-u, I have something to ask you.

429
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,673
Is the person you like Soo-bin or me?

430
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,467
-What?
-I think that you like me.

431
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:35,635
My friends think so too.

432
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,222
But last time, it seemed like
you were interested in Soo-bin.

433
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:40,849
Is it because I kept ignoring you?

434
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,600
Is it like
"something is better than nothing?"

435
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:44,644
Stupid.

436
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:48,815
Hey. Did you think it'd be that easy to
go out with the queen of Cheonbong High?

437
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,111
-Hey, Moon Chan-yeol.
-It's Hwang Ro-mi.

438
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,030
Stop making lame jokes.

439
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,323
Oh, Hwang Ro-mi.

440
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,326
Let me make it clear.

441
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,702
-I--
-The bus is here.

442
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:23,391
He turns all red whenever he sees me.

443
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:24,934
How cute.

444
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:28,938
Right. How could I forget that?

445
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:31,983
-Sir, one person.
-Two people.

446
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,276
-No, one person.
-Two people.

447
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,861
-Hurry up and get in.
-Two people.

448
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,743
I'll get off.

449
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:51,920
I want to get off.

450
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,339
Sir, I'm sorry, but can you let me off?

451
00:27:58,885 --> 00:27:59,886
Bye.

452
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,180
Hey, Jun-u!

453
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:08,978
What is wrong with her?

454
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,653
What?

455
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,989
Darn it, Jun-u...

456
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,045
What do you know?

457
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,131
You didn't graduate from
Seoul National University.

458
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,968
You didn't even go to a university
in Seoul. What do you know?

459
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:44,848
Darn it. That's exactly
what my mom said to me

460
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,058
ten years ago. My goodness.

461
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:50,478
Hold on.

462
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,731
Has he been possessed by my mom?

463
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:56,860
Is that true, Mom?

464
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,866
Why Ma Hwi-yeong of all people?

465
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,503
I still miss you, Mom.

466
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,851
You've never dated anyone.

467
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,103
What were you thinking, giving him advice?

468
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,526
THANK YOU FOR APPLYING
FOR OUR JOB OPENING.

469
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,320
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU DID NOT
PASS THE INTERVIEW.

470
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:43,615
I've failed the interview again.

471
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,746
I'm doomed.

472
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:53,792
My nose is all stuffy.

473
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,255
I'm depressed enough already.

474
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,801
Why do you have to cry and be so annoying?

475
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,803
Hey, mister.

476
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,514
If you're going to keep crying,

477
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:10,600
can you go outside and cry, please?
Mister.

478
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:11,810
I'm not crying.

479
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,021
I'm sadder than you right now!

480
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,815
Go outside and cry, please.

481
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:21,528
Do you know that I want to cry
a lot more than you do?

482
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:31,913
I should still ask him
and check what really happened.

483
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,039
Why?

484
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,291
Because I hate being
in a situation like this.

485
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,293
I should get it sorted out
as soon as possible

486
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,295
so that I can focus on studying again.

487
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:42,298
Well, you know.
Who cares if it was just my imagination?

488
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,260
It's not like I'll be fined
or get marks deducted.

489
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:49,097
I am Yoo Soo-bin, a confident girl.

490
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,683
You got this, Yoo Soo-bin.

491
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,567
This is so hard.

492
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,831
CHOE JUN-U

493
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,592
IT'S OKAY

494
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,468
"It's okay"?

495
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,178
Who is this?

496
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:39,397
IT'S OKAY

497
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:45,737
Hello?

498
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,364
Hello?

499
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,116
Is this Jun-u?

500
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:52,952
Soo-bin.

501
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:57,040
It's me, Soo-bin.

502
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,376
Jun-u.

503
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,212
Can you hear me?

504
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:06,925
What's going on?

505
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:09,844
Hello?

506
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,602
Did he just hang up on me?

507
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,271
What? He hung up on me.

508
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:28,529
It got all messed up. Totally messed up.

509
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,623
But today isn't over yet.

510
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,344
Why didn't I think of this sooner?

511
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,263
LOG IN

512
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,768
ENTER THE CODE IN YOUR TEXT MESSAGE

513
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,524
Darn it.

514
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:09,862
Right.

515
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,759
But where does Soo-bin live?

516
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,389
Jun-u, what is wrong with you?

517
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,225
Do you even know anything?

518
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,437
It was bad timing.

519
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,481
I shouldn't have told her today.

520
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,776
I could've waited until tomorrow
or the day after.

521
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,530
Today wasn't the only day
I could say it to her.

522
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,889
Jung O-je, this jerk.

523
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,517
He ghosts me whenever he wants.

524
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,560
Are we really dating?

525
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:10,149
Gosh. Don't be so clingy, Da-huin.

526
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,527
Guys get sick of things like that
very quickly.

527
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,112
What did I do?

528
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,532
Well, don't all girlfriends do this?

529
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,994
-O-je.
-Yes.

530
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,079
Let's talk.

531
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:24,831
About what?

532
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:29,127
-Go away, lovebirds.
-You didn't call me last night.

533
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,463
Oh, I had to work last night.

534
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:35,091
-Where?
-You know, at the snack bar.

535
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:38,094
-But you didn't have a shift yesterday.
-I did. I had to work.

536
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:39,846
-Let's...
-Let's go!

537
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,607
Well, about yesterday...

538
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:55,027
Well, thanks for taking me
to the nurse's office yesterday.

539
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:58,322
I actually called you last night.

540
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:00,908
Why?

541
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,537
I thought about it and realized
I never thanked you properly,

542
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,331
and I felt bad because you probably
ruined your exam because of me.

543
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,457
That's why I called you.

544
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:11,169
It seemed like someone picked up,
but I couldn't hear anything.

545
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,379
It's okay, though.
Sometimes, you don't hear anything

546
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:16,215
even if the call gets connected.
It happens.

547
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,759
Anyway, thanks and sorry.

548
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:19,886
Thank you.

549
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,262
I have to go. Bye.

550
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,975
She called me.

551
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:30,396
You really don't have any friends.
Not even one person called

552
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,522
or texted you.

553
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,110
One person did call.

554
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:38,696
Who is "It's okay"?

555
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,741
I picked up, but there was no answer.

556
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,910
Your phone is a piece of junk.
Get a new one.

557
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,871
Why is it that nothing is going my way?

558
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,498
As if the entire universe
is working against me.

559
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,212
-Soo-bin.
-Hi. What?

560
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:57,006
-Hey, did you do your homework?
-Did you think you lost your phone?

561
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,716
-You dummy.
-Hey!

562
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,968
-You couldn't find it?
-That's not it.

563
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,428
Look at her all chipper

564
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:05,139
while completely ignoring
my confession yesterday.

565
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,698
It's so weird.

566
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,411
Don't tell me my dear Ro-mi
has a crush on that newbie.

567
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,747
Gosh, no way.

568
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,041
It's possible.

569
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:37,129
In any case,
weird questions like Question 15

570
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:40,508
shouldn't be on exams in the future.

571
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:44,095
That's why I asked you
to meet me at this early hour.

572
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,347
-Ma'am, the question wasn't weird.
-Enough.

573
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:52,520
Mr. Park wanted to come up
with high-quality questions

574
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:56,440
that were more original,

575
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,276
and he got a little too enthusiastic.

576
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,028
-That's why...
-Yes, sir.

577
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,613
-Mr. Oh, there you are.
-Yes, sir.

578
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,949
This is Hwi-yeong's mother.

579
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,035
I see. I've heard a lot about you, ma'am.

580
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,246
I'm Hwi-yeong's new homeroom teacher.

581
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,956
Mr. Oh Han-gyeol, right?

582
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:16,252
Yes. It's nice to meet you, ma'am.

583
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:19,088
You see... Please don't take this
the wrong way.

584
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:21,090
I'd like to make a suggestion.

585
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,342
Pardon me?

586
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,011
An open class?

587
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:30,641
We already had one
at the beginning of the semester.

588
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:31,976
Yes, I'm aware.

589
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:36,105
I'd like another one just for Class Three.

590
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,274
For your English class.

591
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:42,361
I see. You'd like to know
how competent I am as a teacher.

592
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:46,198
You're as smart as I expected.

593
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,327
I'm afraid I can't do that.

594
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:54,665
I am actually planning
to hold a meeting with the parents

595
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:57,626
and introduce myself
as the kids' new homeroom teacher.

596
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:02,006
But I don't think my competence
has to be verified by the parents.

597
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,603
One more thing.

598
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:19,273
I heard that you put the brakes

599
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:23,152
on Hwi-yeong's plans every time.

600
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,945
I put the brakes on his plans?

601
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:27,948
The former homeroom teacher, Mr. Kim,

602
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:31,535
let Hwi-yeong have control
over his study plans

603
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:36,165
as far as I know. I mean, full control.

604
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:40,252
That's why the average scores
of Class Three could be

605
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:42,088
at the top of the whole year.

606
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,924
So I'd appreciate it

607
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,968
if you could actively support

608
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,180
Hwi-yeong's study plans.

609
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,980
Nullifying the question?
It doesn't make sense.

610
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,817
Sang-hun, the question itself...

611
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:05,820
I'll be the top student
if it's not nullified.

612
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,655
-Fine, let me explain inside.
-Gosh.

613
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,824
-This is driving me crazy.
-Let me explain. Come.

614
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:15,454
Ms. Park, see you again.

615
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,769
Good morning, everyone.

616
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,354
Let's start our morning assembly.

617
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,356
Did something good happen?

618
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,233
Hwi-yeong is the top student again.

619
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,443
Really?

620
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,778
Hwi-yeong, congratulations.

621
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:49,864
Thank you, Mr. Oh.

622
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:51,907
If it wasn't for Question 15 in math,

623
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,742
Sang-hun would've been
top of our year, right?

624
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:54,702
I think so.

625
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:58,247
Is it true all the answer choices
for Question 15 are considered correct?

626
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,041
That's what I heard.

627
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,253
-That's a relief.
-That must drive Sang-hun crazy.

628
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,547
He got it right in the first place.

629
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:10,009
I got it wrong, but Hwi-yeong saved me.

630
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:11,719
Thanks, Hwi-yeong.

631
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,056
All right.

632
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:19,435
There's something we need to do
before the morning assembly.

633
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:21,020
To fill the vacancy,

634
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:24,064
we'll elect a class vice president.

635
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,733
-What?
-Suddenly?

636
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:26,817
-Really?
-Why?

637
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,444
-This is sudden.
-Why?

638
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,237
Don't worry, Mr. Oh.

639
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,447
I can handle it alone.

640
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,991
Right. I'll help him out too.

641
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,368
I appreciate it, guys.

642
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,995
You guys are so reliable.

643
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:40,748
Still, let's do it.

644
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:44,376
Hwi-yeong has too much
to deal with. It hurts me.

645
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:51,675
-Either Gi-tae or Soo-bin--
-We don't have much time.

646
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:56,305
You can either volunteer
or recommend someone else.

647
00:41:56,388 --> 00:42:00,017
But it has to be someone
who doesn't have any role right now.

648
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:01,810
Come on, guys.

649
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,563
-Volunteer or recommend.
-Kwon Da-huin.

650
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,481
Me!

651
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:07,024
-Yoon So-ye.
-All right.

652
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:09,652
-Lee Yun-jin?
-So-ye, Da-huin...

653
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,237
-Me!
-All right.

654
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,240
Either volunteer or recommend.

655
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,201
Me?

656
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:18,869
-No way.
-Why?

657
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,871
-I can't do it.
-Me!

658
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,000
I won't do it.

659
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,836
Hurry up, guys.

660
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,967
All right. Pil-sang. Who else?

661
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,843
-Does he have a desire for power?
-No one else?

662
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:38,931
All right. Who wants Pil-sang
as our class vice president?

663
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:40,766
That's not a good idea.

664
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:41,934
I'm against it.

665
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:44,770
Pil-sang put your hand down.

666
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:50,526
Unfortunately, everyone is
against it, Pil-sang.

667
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,861
Okay. Who else?

668
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,117
Jun-u, what is it?

669
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,454
I'd like to recommend someone
for the position.

670
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,164
You're not volunteering?

671
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,584
Jun-u, you better not recommend me.

672
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:08,877
Who do you recommend?

673
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:11,255
Mr. Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm not interested at all.

674
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:12,339
I'll...

675
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,258
do it.

676
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:18,012
-What?
-What?

677
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:21,515
You?

678
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,935
You recommend yourself?

679
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:30,274
-I approve.
-Me too.

680
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:31,400
Me too.

681
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:35,321
This is very unexpected. Okay.

682
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,448
Mr. Oh, he's definitely better
than Pil-sang.

683
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:38,991
-I approve.
-Me too.

684
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:40,492
-Really?
-I approve!

685
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,703
-He's better than Pil-sang.
-Who approves?

686
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,497
Choe Jun-u for the class vice president.

687
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,249
Choe Jun-u for the class vice president.

688
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,043
Choe Jun-u for the class vice president.

689
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:50,878
It's decided.

690
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:53,047
Congratulations.

691
00:43:58,427 --> 00:43:59,428
Congratulations.

692
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:01,513
Congratulations.

693
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:08,437
Jun-u became the class vice president?

694
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,982
Yes. And what's more surprising is

695
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,400
that he volunteered.

696
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:17,196
Jun-u is doing well in school.

697
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:18,906
You don't have to worry too much.

698
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,700
Mr. Oh, thank you.

699
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,994
Thank you so much.

700
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,585
Jun-u became the class vice president?

701
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:34,755
The class vice president.

702
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:38,175
Rock-paper-scissors!

703
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:40,678
Jun-u wins. Pick one.

704
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,432
-Soo-bin.
-Soo-bin. Come.

705
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:46,809
What about you, Hwi-yeong?

706
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,228
-Ro-mi.
-Ro-mi.

707
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:51,105
Ro-mi, stand behind Hwi-yeong.

708
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,065
One more time. Ready.

709
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:55,484
Rock-paper-scissors. Hwi-yeong wins.

710
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:57,569
You can attack anyone
whether it's a boy or a girl.

711
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,363
You get hit, you're out, okay?

712
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:00,322
-Okay.
-Okay.

713
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,741
First... Team Gi-tae, get ready.

714
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,701
Let's do this.

715
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,496
-Gosh!
-Yes!

716
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:09,998
-Oh, my.
-Let's go!

717
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:17,965
Gosh, that would hurt.

718
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,763
Guys, what are you two doing?

719
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,098
Give the ball to someone else.

720
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:27,307
Soo-bin!

721
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,645
-Here we go!
-Ro-mi, here.

722
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:35,899
Hey!

723
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,986
Da-huin! Here you go!

724
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:47,703
Here we go.

725
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,247
Over here!

726
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,459
Go!

727
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,127
Hurry up!

728
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:57,629
Oh, my.

729
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:03,844
-Hold on.
-Come here.

730
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,141
Yes!

731
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:30,829
Jun-u.

732
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,833
Soo-bin, you're like a pea.

733
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:36,376
A tiny pea.

734
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:43,717
Jun-u is out!

735
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:58,524
I can't believe what Jun-u did.

736
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:01,735
Why did he overprotect you like that?

737
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:05,614
I'm sure he just wanted to catch the ball.

738
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:09,326
Now that he's the class vice president,

739
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:11,161
does he want a brand-new image?

740
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:14,540
Gosh.

741
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:18,961
Then again, what I really can't
believe is what that girl did.

742
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:22,172
She attacked you pretending to attack me.

743
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,968
Gosh, it hurts so much.

744
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:28,679
Sorry, Da-huin.

745
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:30,806
Put that halibut away.

746
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:32,641
Halibut?

747
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:34,977
By the way, O-je was amazing.

748
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,354
I guess.

749
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:40,232
As always. It's no surprise.

750
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:48,907
What are you doing? You're so annoying.

751
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,701
-Move over.
-I love you, Da-huin.

752
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:05,340
-Over there.
-Watch out!

753
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:06,550
Good!

754
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:09,219
-Watch out!
-Over here.

755
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,805
-Good job.
-Let's go!

756
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,042
Do I have a parasite or what?

757
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:42,294
-Why am I always hungry?
-Darn you.

758
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:44,087
We're going to be late.

759
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:46,214
Stop messing around.

760
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,353
MEN'S LOCKER ROOM

761
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:17,287
I took care of the math test issue.

762
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,667
-How?
-You worthless idiot.

763
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,919
How could you humiliate
your father like this?

764
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:28,924
Why do I have to kiss up to someone
because of you?

765
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:30,300
For what?

766
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:32,094
I'm sorry.

767
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,515
It's going to be concluded that
there was a problem with the question.

768
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:38,642
But Mr. Jo's son, Jo Sang-hun,

769
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:40,769
solved that question without any trouble.

770
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,021
But what about you?

771
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:46,858
I've spent my precious money
for your education.

772
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:48,819
Is that all you can do?

773
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:51,029
Is it?

774
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:54,658
Honey, wait. Don't do this.

775
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:56,326
Hwi-yeong tried really hard this time.

776
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,453
-Honey, please.
-Was that him trying his best?

777
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,163
-Honey, please...
-I told you to move.

778
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,289
Move!

779
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,125
Go upstairs, Mom.

780
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:04,042
No.

781
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:06,878
No. You can hit me instead.

782
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:08,088
-Hit me.
-Right.

783
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,173
You're responsible too.

784
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,926
I'll teach both of you a lesson today.

785
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:42,956
Hey, Jun-u.

786
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:48,003
Do you want me to clear your name?

787
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:51,506
You know, about stealing that watch.

788
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:54,009
I'll prove you're innocent. How about it?

789
00:50:57,804 --> 00:51:00,098
There's no need. You missed the chance.

790
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:04,060
I'll clear your name for you.
Don't you want that?

791
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:07,731
Is this because you're angry at Hwi-yeong
about the math test?

792
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:12,027
Take care of it on your own.
Instead of trying to use me.

793
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:15,363
Hey, Jun-u. Hey!

794
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:24,998
Hwi-yeong.

795
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:32,839
Hey.

796
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:36,802
-Hey.
-You shit.

797
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:38,303
You fucking coward.

798
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:40,555
How could you use your mom
to coax the math teacher?

799
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:43,809
I was going to be top of our year.
How could you rig the exam?

800
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:46,102
Rig what?

801
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:48,980
The math teacher admitted that
the question itself was wrong.

802
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:52,734
You're not at the top because you couldn't
beat me in other subjects. Don't blame me.

803
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,152
This is unbelievable.

804
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,613
Hey. Your parents made such a fuss,

805
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:59,324
and the math teacher eventually
gave in. You think I don't know that?

806
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:03,954
Did you see it?

807
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:05,914
Do you have proof?

808
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:07,916
Do you have proof, you bastard?

809
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:11,086
Well, I guess it's not your fault.

810
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:13,588
You're just your parents' pet.

811
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,259
It'd be better for me to ask them myself.

812
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,221
You just wait, Hwi-yeong.

813
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:24,599
I'll fix this by all means
and be top of our year.

814
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:29,354
Right, I guess you are guilty
of something.

815
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,983
Of not being as bright as me.

816
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:37,404
You little...

817
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:56,798
Well, I guess it's not your fault.

818
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:59,175
You're just your parents' pet.

819
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:36,129
-Of course, I did.
-Gosh, you must be proud.

820
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:37,505
I do feel proud.

821
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:42,052
Who wants to come to Soo-bin's house
to hang out today? Me.

822
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:44,262
-Soo-bin, you have to come.
-Yeah.

823
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,139
-I'll let you hang out with us.
-Be quiet.

824
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:47,432
Let's go eat tteokbokki.

825
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:48,975
-Okay.
-Tteokbokki!

826
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,019
Yes, let's go eat tteokbokki.

827
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:58,068
Here you go, I brought your fried squid.

828
00:53:58,151 --> 00:53:59,319
Enjoy your meal.

829
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:00,737
-They're so big.
-Thank you.

830
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,822
Welcome. Come sit over here.

831
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:05,367
Hello, sir. I'm O-je's friend.

832
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:09,371
You sit next to O-je. Was it Choe Jun-u?

833
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:10,455
Yes.

834
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:14,376
You transferred, and you're good
at drawing. Am I right?

835
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:15,502
Yes.

836
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:18,004
It's nice to meet you. I'm O-je's dad.

837
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:21,132
You're even better looking than I heard.

838
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:23,385
You're almost as handsome as my son.

839
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,349
O-je.

840
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:30,850
-Yes.
-Jun-u is here.

841
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,769
-Oh, okay.
-Hold on.

842
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:35,146
Jun-u.

843
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:40,193
-Whose baby is that?
-It's my brother, O-dong.

844
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,403
Isn't he cute?

845
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:44,656
Hang on. I'll get you
some tteokbokki and fries.

846
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:46,992
Later. I came here because...

847
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:48,535
-O-je.
-Yes?

848
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,245
-This is an emergency.
-Why?

849
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:51,746
The delivery orders are pouring in.

850
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,164
Oh, boy.

851
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:55,417
-Don't cry, O-dong.
-Welcome.

852
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,335
-Hello.
-Welcome.

853
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:58,837
-Take a seat.
-What should I do?

854
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:01,881
Mom won't be back for a while.

855
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,634
Don't cry, O-dong. Don't cry.

856
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,302
You need some help with the delivery?

857
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:09,014
I'd be grateful, but there are
so many orders.

858
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,269
Instead of that...

859
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:21,735
Is that his baby?

860
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:23,445
He looks so young.

861
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:28,408
Oh, my. He looks just like his dad.

862
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:29,909
How handsome.

863
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:32,328
He's not my son.

864
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,634
Looking good.

865
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:50,346
Thanks. Let's go.

866
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:53,016
O-je. I have something to ask you.

867
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:54,642
Let's go and talk. It's hot.

868
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,269
Let's go get some tteokbokki.

869
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:57,729
Yoo Soo-bin...

870
00:55:57,896 --> 00:55:58,938
What?

871
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:01,357
Where is Soo-bin?

872
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,487
Do you know where Soo-bin lives?

873
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:07,238
What?

874
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:11,159
So that's how everything went wrong.

875
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:12,285
No.

876
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:14,537
That was just an excuse.

877
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:19,250
I didn't know how to react
since it was my first time.

878
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,169
But...

879
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,130
I really meant what I said.

880
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,468
I really meant it.

881
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:43,024
I really meant it.

882
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,036
I really meant it.

883
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:07,340
Da-huin said Soo-bin will be home
if you go now.

884
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:10,176
But what is it that
you have to give her yourself?

885
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:12,929
Jun-u.

886
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:15,098
Why do you walk so fast?

887
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:16,683
We ran into each other again.

888
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:20,103
-I guess.
-What are you doing here?

889
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,522
I'm here to see Soo-bin.

890
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:23,940
I'll see you at school.

891
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:25,733
I'm on my way to Soo-bin's house too.

892
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:29,362
Why do you want to see her?
You could just send a message.

893
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:32,407
Well, Ro-mi. It's...

894
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:34,868
I have something important
to tell Soo-bin.

895
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,578
Can I meet her first?

896
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:45,962
What is it?

897
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:47,839
I want to say something
since I ran into you.

898
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:54,179
All right,
I'll accept your feelings for me.

899
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:55,763
This is our first day as a couple.

900
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,225
I know you have feelings for me.

901
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:03,354
I've been thinking it over,
and I guess I'll accept you.

902
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:05,732
Let's go out. You and me.

903
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:10,653
Ro-mi.

904
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:14,282
It looks like there's been
some misunderstanding.

905
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,619
I don't have any feelings for you.

906
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:20,246
What? Are you playing hard to get?

907
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:22,999
Don't lie to me.
I saw you staring at me all the time.

908
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,543
Did you think I wouldn't know?

909
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:29,047
I have feelings for Soo-bin.

910
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:33,760
You probably thought I was looking at you

911
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:36,721
because I was staring at Soo-bin.

912
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:40,308
I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong idea,

913
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:42,477
but I should still tell you the truth.

914
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,314
How could you have a crush on her, not me?

915
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,483
She is Hwi-yeong's girlfriend.

916
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,568
No, she's not.

917
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,195
I've confirmed it with her.

918
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,077
I have to go.

919
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,540
I wonder if they'll make you
take another level test.

920
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:07,877
Soo-bin.

921
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:20,098
Hello, I'm Choe Jun-u.

922
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:22,559
I'm Soo-bin's classmate.

923
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:25,812
Yes, I know.

924
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:27,272
And?

925
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:29,857
-I...
-Hey, Jun-u.

926
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,359
We're in a bit of a rush,

927
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:33,486
so let's talk tomorrow at school.
Let's go, Mom.

928
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:34,487
Wait.

929
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:44,122
May I talk with Soo-bin for a moment?

930
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:13,818
Soo-bin, do you want to go to the movies?

931
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:20,950
-Another couple?
-Congratulations, Soo-bin.

932
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:24,120
I can do it. I got this.

933
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:26,873
Welcome to the English open class!

934
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:30,293
Does anyone have a different opinion?

935
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:31,794
I...

936
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:34,005
disagree with that opinion.

937
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:35,673
Make things go back to how they were.

938
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:37,008
Then I'll keep my lips sealed.

939
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:39,636
I'll try to persuade Sang-hun again.

940
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:41,220
Please have mercy, sir.

941
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:44,515
Sang-hun, let it go for my sake. Please?

942
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:48,561
Gosh, you're only 18 once.

943
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:04,577
