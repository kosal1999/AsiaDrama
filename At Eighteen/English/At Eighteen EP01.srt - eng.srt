1
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,130
Sir, please take me to this address.

2
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,549
Your destination has been set.

3
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,767
Unlike yesterday,
the sky looks very clear today.

4
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,853
It's been raining for the last few days,
and on my way...

5
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,438
I'm leaving, just like this.

6
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,648
Summer seems just around the corner.

7
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,116
Just like this, I'm on the road
once again to someplace else.

8
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:31,090
Time didn't wait for me
and just passed me by,

9
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,634
with all those moments.

10
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,280
You are approaching your destination.

11
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,616
Sir, this way.

12
00:01:58,493 --> 00:01:59,994
Anyway, I'm at this moment.

13
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,664
Anyway, I'm 18.

14
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,098
Take a left 300 meters ahead.

15
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,313
Go straight.

16
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,044
Take a right 100 meters ahead.

17
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,351
That crazy--

18
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,901
Is he all right?

19
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,904
Shouldn't we get off and check?

20
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,031
He seems okay.

21
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,367
He didn't even fall off.

22
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,286
Let's go.

23
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:26,080
Wait, even if he didn't fall off...

24
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,588
Hey, kitty.

25
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,093
Where's your mom?

26
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,350
It's dangerous here. Play somewhere else.

27
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,149
Bye!

28
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,201
CONGRATULATIONS
MOST IMPROVED SCHOOL

29
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,745
-Yoo Soo-bin!
-Yoo Soo-bin!

30
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:07,830
Hi!

31
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,666
Hey, this has grown quite a bit.

32
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,211
Did you buy this?

33
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,755
-My gosh, it's so cool.
-It's pretty.

34
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,258
My mom bought it for me
on her business trip.

35
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:19,968
I was going to get this too.

36
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:23,054
-Isn't this a knockoff?
-There are knockoffs of this?

37
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,931
What if it's really a knockoff?

38
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,643
I walked here all the way from home.

39
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,353
-My legs hurt so much.
-What?

40
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,897
Good, I hope you'll lose some weight.

41
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,148
I'm so exhausted.

42
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,652
My legs are all wobbly.

43
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,779
Hang on. Just a moment.

44
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,699
What's going on?

45
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,876
Excuse me! You in the checkered shirt...

46
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,257
Are you all right?

47
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:00,758
Pardon me?

48
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:05,013
Oh, you almost got hit by a car earlier.

49
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,347
That was my mom's car.

50
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,436
Try doing this.

51
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,035
Good. You seem all right.

52
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,332
If there are any issues,
find me at school.

53
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,710
My name is Yoo Soo-bin.
I'm in the 3rd class of the 2nd grade.

54
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,181
Soo-bin, what happened?

55
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,807
Is it okay to give out your name?

56
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,769
He nearly got hit by my mom's car earlier.

57
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,396
We should take responsibility
if we have to.

58
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,565
Still, you don't even know who he is.

59
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,068
By the way, isn't that guy so handsome?

60
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,945
Not at all. Da-huin, don't look at him.

61
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,784
I think he is.

62
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:11,037
Hey, Soo-bin!

63
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,790
My hair looks so bad!

64
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,583
-Look at my hair.
-What happened?

65
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,668
No, it looks okay.

66
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,587
-It doesn't look okay.
-What's that? Your lunch?

67
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,798
No! I'm not giving it to you.

68
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,134
Yoo Soo-bin?

69
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,930
Look at what he's wearing. Hey, you!

70
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:36,854
Yes.

71
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,689
-Hello.
-Yes, hello...

72
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,901
Mr. Nam.

73
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,694
Excuse me.

74
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,833
Good morning, everyone.

75
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,417
-Hello.
-Hi.

76
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,421
-Hello.
-Yes, hi.

77
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,258
-Excuse me, sir.
-All right.

78
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,968
-Hello.
-Hello.

79
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,096
Let's see.

80
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,975
Excuse me, sir.

81
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,061
I'm a transfer student.

82
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:23,568
-Are you the one from Byeong...
-Yes, from Byeongmun High School.

83
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,946
I see. You're here.

84
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,157
Mr. Oh.

85
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,451
Mr. Oh?

86
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,120
Mr. Oh Han-gyeol isn't here yet.

87
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,998
My gosh, I'm sorry I'm late.

88
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,837
Follow him. Go on.

89
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,340
Hello?

90
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,259
Hi, how have you been?

91
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,307
His homeroom teacher is giving him
an orientation at the moment.

92
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,853
Yes, I'm aware.

93
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:03,816
Oh, you can leave it here.

94
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,152
Well, I'm sure nothing will happen.

95
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,155
Yes, right. Please don't worry.

96
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,117
Yes. Take care.

97
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,340
TRANSFERRED ACCORDING TO ARTICLE 17.1
OF THE SCHOOL VIOLENCE LAW

98
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:35,181
So this is... It's a case of forced...

99
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,390
A forced transfer, sir.

100
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,187
You should never talk about that openly.

101
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,482
And... I understand.
Things happen, you know?

102
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,195
Let's do something
about your clothes first, okay?

103
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,364
Ms. Bae, where can we buy
the school uniform?

104
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,449
At the school uniform store, obviously.

105
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,867
Right, obviously.

106
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:58,496
There's a store that sells uniforms
at the nearby intersection,

107
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,332
so get changed
into the uniform first and...

108
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,793
CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'VE WON
THE EVENT FOR LUXURY SNEAKERS...

109
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,922
Hang on. Why is this already...

110
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,049
Well, hey.

111
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,677
I mean... First, you should...

112
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,137
-Hi, Hwi-yeong.
-Oh, see that guy?

113
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:18,266
He's the class president.
You can follow him.

114
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:19,767
Just follow him.

115
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,105
Go with the class president.

116
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,065
-He's a transfer student.
-I see.

117
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,567
Let's go.

118
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,652
Yes, go on.

119
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,405
Yes, ma'am.

120
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,115
I'm with your son now. Yes.

121
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,242
He's very mature for his age.

122
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,494
Yes, he'll do well here. That's right.

123
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,537
Go on.

124
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,708
-See you in a bit.
-Yes, sir.

125
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,963
PAYMENT COMPLETED.
YOUR ORDER WILL BE SHIPPED SOON.

126
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,256
Isn't Mr. Oh cute?

127
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,133
He's our assistant teacher.

128
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,343
Our homeroom teacher is hospitalized now.

129
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,598
I'm Ma Hwi-yeong. It's nice to meet you.

130
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,100
-I'm...
-Choe Jun-u?

131
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,352
The vice-principal told me
about you yesterday.

132
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,314
You don't have the uniform yet, right?

133
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,401
-Hey, Hwi-yeong.
-Hi, Gi-tae.

134
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:12,653
Let's go.

135
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,040
LEE TAE-HO

136
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,843
These pants will be better.

137
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,055
I'm fine with anything.

138
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,391
You shouldn't be fine with anything.

139
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,561
Put them on.

140
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,440
Thank you, ma'am.

141
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,650
They're practically new.

142
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,027
I made sure to find the best ones
since you asked.

143
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,780
-You know it's usually not free.
-I do, of course.

144
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,406
I have the summer uniform ready too.

145
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,241
Thank you.

146
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,962
This is for today's morning assembly.

147
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,632
Introduce the transfer student
and submit the evaluation sheets.

148
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,769
Classes begin at 9 a.m.,

149
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,688
but we often have to be here
by 8:10 a.m. for supplementary classes.

150
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,399
And the midterm's coming up soon.

151
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,609
I'm not sure if you've covered
the same chapters.

152
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,069
The lockers are here.

153
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,570
Look for Lee Gi-tae,

154
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,906
the student life leader.
He'll tell you which one to use.

155
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,577
DID YOU MEMORIZE 50 ENGLISH WORDS?

156
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,335
Let's go.

157
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,758
You'll learn this soon,
but all the teachers here are great.

158
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,468
They're all highly qualified as well.

159
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:03,431
I bet they're better than most
top-notch instructors at academies.

160
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,225
Everyone talks about
special-purpose or private schools,

161
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,812
but I think this school will be more
helpful for us to get into good colleges.

162
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,898
Oh, the after-school studying hours.

163
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,693
It's not compulsory, but everyone
does it during the exam times.

164
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,613
There's a separate performance
assessment group for each subject.

165
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,323
And about the practical evaluation...

166
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,871
It must be confusing
to hear about all this at once.

167
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,415
First, go over the notices
in our class group chat.

168
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,749
They'll give you an idea.

169
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,085
If you have any questions, ask me anytime.

170
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:34,712
Wait here.

171
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,382
-Goodness.
-Hey!

172
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,550
Someone left this for you.

173
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,802
What is it? Does it mean something?

174
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,180
The wheel of fate is turning.

175
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,723
I hear the creaking noise.

176
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:48,184
Didn't you say a waterwheel
was spinning last time?

177
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,728
-Let's go.
-There's a ton of people at NW.

178
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,938
Where is NW? North, south, west, or east?

179
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,648
North. It's north, you idiot.

180
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,568
-Okay, north.
-Hey, where's the bulletproof car?

181
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,278
-Where is the bulletproof car?
-No idea.

182
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,614
You idiot, you should know where it is.

183
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,949
-It was amazing!
-I know.

184
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,744
This is crazy.

185
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:07,828
Guys, be seated.

186
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,915
Get your act together.

187
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,334
Yoo Pil-sang, be seated.

188
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,212
It's time for our morning assembly.

189
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,884
-Yoo Pil-sang.
-Yes, what's up?

190
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,720
Hey.

191
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,390
You punk.

192
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,314
-Something's come up for Mr. Oh.
-Every day?

193
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,025
I'll introduce the transfer student first.

194
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:39,610
Jun-u.

195
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,369
Didn't we see him earlier?

196
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,622
Hey.

197
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,416
Isn't he...

198
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,589
Jun-u, please introduce yourself.

199
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,676
I'm Choe Jun-u.

200
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,853
What's with him? That's all?

201
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,773
Hey, let me ask you a question.

202
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:18,816
Pil-sang, don't.

203
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,946
Can you tell us a bit more?

204
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,868
He's from Byeongmun High School.

205
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:29,994
Byeongmun?

206
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,537
Where is that?

207
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,665
It seems like a lousy school.

208
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:38,627
Jun-u had to move here
because of his parents' work.

209
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,380
That's why he transferred to our school.

210
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,966
Let's get to know him better later on.

211
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,801
It wasn't because of my parents' work.

212
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,558
-It wasn't?
-Then what was it?

213
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,435
Something personal?

214
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,566
I transferred because...

215
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,319
He's new here. We should all help him out.

216
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,529
He'll sit...

217
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,079
Sorry.

218
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,540
O-je is here.

219
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,669
O-je, can you move?

220
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,004
To the seat next to Pil-sang.

221
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,509
Jun-u is a new student.

222
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,802
What's up with him?

223
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,263
Does he think
I'll bully the newbie or something?

224
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,223
Won't you?

225
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,266
You little...

226
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:36,936
Well...

227
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,313
-Sure.
-Thanks.

228
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,023
Jun-u.

229
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,321
God, you stink of sweat.

230
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:48,572
Welcome.

231
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,745
I have some announcements to make.

232
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,998
Some groups haven't turned in
their assignments yet.

233
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,625
Be sure to submit them by Friday.

234
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,003
Also, Pil-sang, please be quiet.

235
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,214
Sorry, guys.

236
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,591
-What's with you?
-I can't believe you!

237
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,134
How could you be so late?

238
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,011
I said I'm sorry. Okay?

239
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,764
-Are you done?
-Not yet.

240
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,265
I covered the new student part.

241
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,393
I see. Good job.

242
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,606
Where is he?

243
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,317
Oh, there he is.

244
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,822
All right.

245
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,574
The midterm's in three weeks.
What are we supposed to do?

246
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,659
I'm Lee Gi-tae.

247
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:38,288
-Welcome.
-Mr. Oh, she thinks you have a cold.

248
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,749
Me? How did you know?

249
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,505
Let's get started. Be quiet.

250
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,636
When it won't open, do this.

251
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,936
Jun-u, you got a good spot.

252
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,360
You didn't have to do that.

253
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,570
What?

254
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,698
You said I transferred
because of my parents' work.

255
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,539
I just thought you seemed to feel
a bit uncomfortable.

256
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,544
That doesn't mean it's okay to lie.

257
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,133
What's the big deal?

258
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,387
Our class president was
just being thoughtful as always.

259
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,764
Hey, checkered shirt!

260
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,766
We're in the same class.

261
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,604
No way.

262
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,982
Again? This morning,
you were on your bike and...

263
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,150
In front of the school gate.

264
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,570
Yes. So you do remember me. That's good.

265
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,031
Do you know each other?

266
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,200
Kind of.

267
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,579
Well, this is Yoo Soo-bin,
our study leader.

268
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,916
And Ma Hwi-yeong's girlfriend.

269
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,754
No way. We're just friends.

270
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,631
Right, Little Boy?

271
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,007
Yes.

272
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,635
We went to kindergarten
and elementary school together.

273
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:18,097
By the way, Jun-u has to join
an assessment group.

274
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:19,932
Right?

275
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,227
Ro-mi, isn't your group kind of small?

276
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,812
But we're already finished.

277
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,271
We'll submit our assignment today.

278
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,481
Really?

279
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,444
Too bad. My group is already too big.

280
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,154
Then maybe another group...

281
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,949
He can join my group.

282
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,535
We're one person short
since the vice president moved away.

283
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:40,994
Soo-bin.

284
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,124
I'll tell you what you need to do later.

285
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,761
Lucky you.

286
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,222
You're in the same group as Soo-bin.

287
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,099
She's super good at performance
assessments.

288
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,268
She's really meticulous.

289
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,186
You're on the bus now.

290
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,646
Enjoy your ride.

291
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,817
What should I make him do?

292
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,028
You didn't have to let him
into your group.

293
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,157
What can I do? There's not much time left.

294
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,367
I feel a sense of responsibility
as the study leader.

295
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,453
Still, don't you need a good grade
in Literature this time?

296
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,790
Soo-bin, how could you?

297
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,251
What about So-ye and me?
Don't you need our consent first?

298
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,503
Only in a situation like this?

299
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,548
Who has done all our assignments so far?

300
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:37,217
Also, who hasn't sent

301
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,345
her part of the assignment yet?

302
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,181
I did a little this time.

303
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,391
I was going to send it to you tonight.

304
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:47,561
Really? Good for you, Da-huin.

305
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,563
Let's be nice and help each other.

306
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,986
Why were you disciplined
at your previous school?

307
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,697
Well... Sir, it's written

308
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,991
on the first page.

309
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,784
I asked just to confirm it.

310
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,745
I see.

311
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,164
Is it true that you were
forced to transfer

312
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:10,125
because you repeatedly committed
theft and assault?

313
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,711
Well...

314
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,798
Tae-ho, you can't get away
with things like that anymore.

315
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:20,344
This school is fundamentally
different from your previous school.

316
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:23,639
It has history, tradition, and class.

317
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,767
If you show any unacceptable behaviors
like these,

318
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,268
in the worst case,

319
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,897
you might be advised to drop out.

320
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,398
Can't I drop out

321
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,860
right now?

322
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,028
Pardon?

323
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,571
Can't I drop out?

324
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:45,035
You're surprisingly unpredictable.

325
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:50,582
Getting on the vice-principal's nerves
would only make your life here harder.

326
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,835
Listening to his one-on-one lecture
once is enough

327
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,838
to make you want to drop out
right then and there.

328
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,634
Well...

329
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,136
Tae-ho.

330
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,889
I'm Jun-u. This is second-hand.

331
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,224
I mean Jun-u.

332
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,435
The thing is, those teachers and I

333
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,230
are the only people who know
that you were forced to transfer.

334
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,024
There's no need to say unnecessary things

335
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,568
and make things awkward.

336
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,736
I mean...

337
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,490
Why don't you make a fresh start?

338
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,951
Forget all your past.

339
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,078
Okay? You can do this.

340
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,454
Let's do this.

341
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,164
Here.

342
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,295
Is the new student
from another planet or something?

343
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,214
I can't find anything about him online.

344
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,926
Stop it, Da-huin.

345
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,136
What?

346
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,763
We should find out what he's like.

347
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,433
Because of you, he's suddenly

348
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,101
in our group.

349
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,061
You're interested in him, aren't you?

350
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,439
I could see he's your type.

351
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,066
What are you talking about? He's not.

352
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,278
Fine, I admit
that he's pretty good-looking.

353
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,781
-Still, he's not my type.
-Agreed.

354
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,284
Da-huin's type is Jung O-je.

355
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,703
-O-je?
-Gosh.

356
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,290
Guys, the new student is unbelievable.

357
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,791
What did you find?

358
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,209
CHOE JUN-U IS BEING FORCED TO TRANSFER

359
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,462
Gosh, "assault and theft"?

360
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,714
Does that mean he stole something?

361
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:23,800
See? What are we going to do now, Soo-bin?

362
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,343
So-ye, what should we do?

363
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,305
What do you mean?

364
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,140
It's not like
he's a gangster or a criminal.

365
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,308
Who knows?

366
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,643
There are many good-looking
psychopaths these days.

367
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,812
Gosh, you're going too far, Da-huin.

368
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,023
Isn't this the new student?

369
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,400
Is this his?

370
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,530
Yes, that's his bike.

371
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,263
Welcome.

372
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,850
Hello. You're hiring, right?

373
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,477
Oh, yes. Are you a student?

374
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:16,978
Well...

375
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,483
I'm in my second year of high school.

376
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,943
Not in middle school?

377
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,152
I'm not.

378
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,445
I'm just joking.

379
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,118
What are you good at?

380
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,123
Do I have to be good at something?

381
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,875
Of course. Otherwise, you can't work here.

382
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,295
To those who answer correctly,

383
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,131
we will send various gifts.

384
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,216
We look forward to your participation...

385
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,384
I knew it.

386
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:50,554
Hey! That thief! Hey!

387
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:09,447
Hey, just take it! Darn it.

388
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,410
What's wrong with you?

389
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:15,537
Here, take it.

390
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:30,594
There is something you're good at.
Running.

391
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,013
Great job.

392
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,520
What?

393
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,105
Put them back where they belong now.

394
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:44,649
-Hurry.
-Okay.

395
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:08,256
Excuse me,
then does that mean I can work here?

396
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,009
Depending on how you clean up.

397
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,677
Hurry up. Over there.

398
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:16,598
Yes, sir.

399
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,351
Why does that lady always ask for favors?

400
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,187
Okay. Yes.

401
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,821
Park Yeong-bae.
I have a little errand for you.

402
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,323
"Park Yeong-bae"?

403
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,700
PARK YEONG-BAE

404
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:40,747
Now, I will explain exponential functions

405
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,958
to you for about 20 minutes.

406
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,502
Why are we doing something so easy?
To go over the basic concept.

407
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:48,755
In principle, you need to input
all the numbers one by one,

408
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,299
but you already know this, right?
I know you're all smart kids.

409
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,803
First of all, let's take a look
at when A and B are bigger than one.

410
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,471
This is X.

411
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,140
I told you not to do that.

412
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,020
All right. Let's review
what we've learned until now

413
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,398
and take some time
for checking by yourselves.

414
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,692
You should check
why you got this question wrong.

415
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,868
Hwi-yeong, you keep making a mistake.

416
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,996
You got this wrong. Do you see?

417
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,039
It's strange.
I thought you'd be good at this.

418
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,668
Hwi-yeong, when you set a range,

419
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,503
you must never get it wrong.

420
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:29,713
I'm so hungry.

421
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:30,964
Hwi-yeong.

422
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,759
Isn't your mom buying snacks today?
I'm starving.

423
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,052
She'll come soon.

424
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,346
-I told you to check.
-Okay.

425
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:40,724
Let's take it step by step.

426
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,225
What is this question asking?

427
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,187
Hwi-yeong. Did you get this wrong?

428
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,606
This one is so easy. Hold on.

429
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,774
Sir, this is really bad.

430
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,068
If you keep this up,
I'll beat you on the exam.

431
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,654
-If you keep--
-I'll tear your ear off.

432
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,865
Stop bothering us and go away.

433
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,995
Okay. Let's see.

434
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,331
Where were we?

435
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,586
-Put that down.
-Yes, sir.

436
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:16,926
Look. I think this part is
where you made a mistake.

437
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,138
Why did you come up with this number here?

438
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:22,849
You little...

439
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,145
Sang-hun, are you solving it right now?

440
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,229
Yes.

441
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:31,775
Good.

442
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,069
Good.

443
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,206
Is that how you solved it?

444
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:47,916
My goodness.

445
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,043
Hey, that seems like a faster way.

446
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:52,003
Although this method is correct too,

447
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,756
don't you think his method
looks more efficient?

448
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,967
Why is it so hard to solve
such an easy question?

449
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,594
Don't you think, Hwi-yeong?

450
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,388
Mr. Jo Sang-hun.

451
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:04,474
Not everyone is a genius like you.

452
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,518
Okay.

453
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,561
I'm starving.

454
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,606
He'll be a perfect student
if he just quits smoking.

455
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,946
Anyway, you shouldn't miss that.
Don't make a mistake.

456
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:18,863
Okay.

457
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:20,949
It's just a mistake.

458
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,747
Guys. Why don't we all take a short break?

459
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,083
-Go outside and get some fresh air.
-Okay.

460
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,292
Jo Sang-hun.

461
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:08,997
I have a delivery for Class 1.

462
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,832
Oh, Hwi-yeong's mom?

463
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:15,253
-Over there. It's Classroom Two.
-Okay.

464
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,465
Oh, wait.

465
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,968
Can you take out
the recyclables in the classroom?

466
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:24,137
-They're from your store too.
-Okay.

467
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:25,722
Thanks.

468
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,485
Jun-u.

469
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,488
What are you doing here?

470
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,448
Oh, I came here for a delivery.

471
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:32,455
-The teacher told me to throw this out.
-Gosh, how could he make you do that?

472
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,541
-Give it to me. I'll throw it out.
-No, it's fine.

473
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:36,751
Give it to me.

474
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,920
Hwi-yeong. Hey.

475
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:41,881
What are you doing?

476
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,468
Hey, it's our delivery. Thank you so much.

477
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,803
Thank you.

478
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,721
Your mom is a savior.

479
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,390
I'm hungry. Let's go.

480
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,056
Jun-u, wait.

481
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,144
I think I threw something away by mistake.

482
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,318
Are you looking for something?

483
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,445
No, it's nothing.

484
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,655
Thanks. See you.

485
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,638
-Are you looking for something?
-No, it's nothing.

486
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,014
Thanks.

487
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,604
Welcome...

488
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,399
Are you the newbie? Park Yeong-bae?

489
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,568
Hi. I'm the part-timer
for the night shift.

490
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,153
I came early to study.

491
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,155
Hello.

492
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:36,120
For goodness' sake.
Stop with the flattery.

493
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,957
I didn't do anything.

494
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,376
Hwi-yeong practically set everything up.

495
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,003
Yes.

496
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:48,549
I'm telling you. Just treat me
to something good later.

497
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,886
You're home. Your mom is on the phone.

498
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,388
Talk about some great timing.

499
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,474
Yes. Of course.

500
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:03,022
Stop singing my praises, Ms. Yoon.

501
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:04,273
Yes.

502
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,820
Did you?

503
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,546
Did you get this wrong?

504
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:29,966
Mr. Jo Sang-hun.
Not everyone is a genius like you.

505
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,217
It's just a mistake.

506
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,971
Yes, ma'am.

507
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,391
I'm so grateful for your consideration.

508
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,980
Yes, okay. Have a good evening.

509
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,608
God, she's so obnoxious.

510
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,362
Was that Hwi-yeong's mom?
What does she want now?

511
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,865
What else? It was because of you again.

512
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:56,826
I'm trying to get you
into Hwi-yeong's math class.

513
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,537
-Mom, please.
-What? Cut it out.

514
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:03,124
Hey, they don't let just anyone
take a level test for that class.

515
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,501
She said she'd try,
so get ready for the test.

516
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:08,921
Gosh, I really don't want to do it.

517
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,007
Why do I have to practically beg
Hwi-yeong's mom

518
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,176
just to get into that class?

519
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,511
Do you really... My gosh, I'm speechless.

520
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,513
Do you really not know
why you need to improve?

521
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,932
Hwi-yeong is top of his year,
whereas you are the 28th.

522
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,518
And you barely managed it.
Do you think you're at his level?

523
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,062
I am studying hard,

524
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,438
and I will get better grades.

525
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,356
How long will it take you
to get better grades, then?

526
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,817
I don't know.
Anyway, I'm not taking that class.

527
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,319
What? Don't be ridiculous.

528
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,737
I'm dead serious. I won't take it.

529
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,114
Hey, then let's get you a tutor at least!

530
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,784
Why do you keep saying
you want to study on your own?

531
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,035
Do you think you're a genius?

532
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:42,080
God, she always does
whatever she wants to do.

533
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,841
I just sent you my part
for the performance assessment.

534
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,259
I'm no longer a nuisance.

535
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,887
All right. I'll have a look.

536
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,558
What will you make the newbie do?

537
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,018
Don't let him be a nuisance.

538
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,524
Which task should I give to Jun-u?

539
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,740
It's me, Soo-bin.
For the performance assessment...

540
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,118
Gosh!

541
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,537
"Assault and theft"?

542
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,706
Forget it.

543
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,793
This time, you can get a free pass.

544
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,052
It didn't seem like
he could do such a thing.

545
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:47,937
Are you all right?

546
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,189
Sorry about that.

547
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:59,991
Are you all right? Try doing this.

548
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:50,833
Mom.

549
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,137
Mom.

550
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:37,129
Son, did you have a good day at school?

551
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,715
How's the school? I bet you're
the most handsome guy there.

552
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,927
Make sure you eat well and study hard.

553
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,679
I have to leave before you get home

554
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,597
because of the restaurant.

555
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:47,765
I'm sorry.

556
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,648
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

557
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,698
Mom, did you stop by?

558
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,617
I told you not to rush.
What if you trip and fall again?

559
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:10,037
I thought you'd be out
of all the side dishes by now.

560
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,206
I couldn't even be there
when you were moving. I'm sorry.

561
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,208
Excuse me. Could we get a bottle of soju?

562
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,293
Sure.

563
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:17,878
I'm working now.

564
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,298
My baby, Jun-u. I love you.

565
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:24,844
I love you too.

566
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,430
Hey, newbie.

567
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,183
Shall I let you in on some information?

568
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,354
See that girl?
The prettiest girl in our class.

569
00:39:58,646 --> 00:39:59,730
She's mine.

570
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,486
Don't you dare look at her.

571
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:08,489
If I ever catch you doing that,
I'll teach you a serious lesson.

572
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:17,873
And that girl over there.
Hwi-yeong has a crush on her.

573
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,837
As for the rest, I don't care
whether you hit on them or not.

574
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,256
Although you'll have a hard time
with that face.

575
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,351
Nice, bravo!

576
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,561
Excellent job, Hwi-yeong.

577
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,273
-Play "Let It Go" next!
-All right, quiet down.

578
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:44,817
What's the matter?

579
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,611
Well, could you please spare me a second?

580
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:58,414
Sir, Choe Jun-u is here.

581
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,547
You know who I am, right?

582
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,261
What is the most famous
of Beethoven's sonatas?

583
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,722
It's the "Moonlight Sonata."

584
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:19,143
The "Moonlight Sonata" consists of
three movements in total.

585
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:20,728
Out of the three movements,

586
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,938
the first one, which Hwi-yeong
played for us just now,

587
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,024
is the most famous one.

588
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:26,692
All right, let's look at the printout.

589
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:27,776
Ma'am.

590
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,487
Yes, Hwi-yeong. What is it?

591
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,155
May I step out
to go to the nurse's office?

592
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:55,513
Are you going to keep
playing dumb like this?

593
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,683
You stole my watch.

594
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:04,480
No, I didn't.

595
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,899
Sorry to interrupt. Sir.

596
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,317
Jun-u.

597
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,070
Oh, hello.

598
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:14,782
Apparently, Jun-u stole his watch.

599
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:15,908
Pardon me?

600
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,870
As soon as he's transferred here...
My gosh.

601
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:24,750
Mr. Son.

602
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,126
Hey, Hwi-yeong.

603
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,755
This punk stole my watch
when he came for the delivery yesterday.

604
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,926
Was it an expensive watch?

605
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:37,513
What kind of watch costs 25 million won?

606
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:40,349
You said 25 million won?

607
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,017
Jun-u, why did you do that?

608
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,980
-I didn't do it.
-Right?

609
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,565
He says he didn't do it.

610
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,942
Who else would have done such a thing?

611
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:53,279
You were the only person to enter
my classroom besides my students.

612
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:54,863
Hwi-yeong, you should know.

613
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:57,533
I've been wearing that watch
every single day,

614
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:59,868
but nothing like this has happened before.

615
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:01,704
I see.

616
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:05,583
Well, are you sure
you didn't lose it somewhere else?

617
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,253
There's no way Jun-u did such a thing.

618
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:13,966
Jun-u, wait.

619
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,926
I think I threw something away by mistake.

620
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:22,391
How can you be so sure?
He only transferred here yesterday.

621
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:24,184
He was forced to transfer here,
to be precise.

622
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:29,023
Sir, there is no evidence yet.

623
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:32,568
Why don't you go home
and take a look under your bed

624
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:35,070
-or in your bathroom cabinet?
-Look.

625
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:39,158
I considered settling,
but I don't think I should.

626
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:40,993
I'll ask the police to investigate.

627
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:43,787
-Look, sir.
-Please try to calm down.

628
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,748
Can we talk for a minute?

629
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,791
No. I have to go shoot an online class.

630
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:48,876
I'll be leaving then.

631
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,545
-Wait.
-Just a second.

632
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,256
What are you waiting for, Mr. Oh?

633
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,841
Well, okay.

634
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:04,892
Sir, can you...

635
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,354
Stop him.

636
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,190
Can we talk?

637
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:13,859
Hwi-yeong, why are you doing this?

638
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:15,903
What are you doing? Hurry up.

639
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,873
Sir, please think again.

640
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,792
I've already given it a lot of thought.

641
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,794
Go change your shoes.

642
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:36,465
Have a seat.

643
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:46,433
Ro-mi, drink this yogurt.

644
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:47,768
Ro-mi.

645
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,270
You don't like yogurt? I see.

646
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:56,443
Are you sure? Did Jun-u really steal it?

647
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:01,407
I'm not sure. I hope not.

648
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,283
But it seems so.

649
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,246
He doesn't seem to be that kind of person.

650
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,917
-How do you know that?
-What?

651
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:17,798
Soo-bin, our group is doomed, aren't we?

652
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:21,260
I hope this doesn't leak out.

653
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:25,347
We already have enough troublemakers
in our school.

654
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:27,975
It already spread everywhere.

655
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:30,727
This is not good.

656
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,563
Haven't you guys lost anything?

657
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:34,523
I should check.

658
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:38,610
Right. My earrings.

659
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,779
I got them for my birthday present.

660
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:42,906
Do you mean these?

661
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,075
-Gosh.
-Oh, right.

662
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:47,035
Da-huin.

663
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,956
We can't be too careful.

664
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:52,624
Eat up.

665
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:56,170
Hwi-yeong, it seems like
your class is in big trouble.

666
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,505
I heard Son Jae-yeong
came and made a scene.

667
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,674
He bragged so much about his watch.
Serves him right.

668
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:03,177
Sang-hun, we're eating.

669
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:11,685
You have something to say?

670
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:16,899
Hwi-yeong, here you go.

671
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:19,109
Oh, thanks.

672
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:22,529
Sim-bok, did you just get Hwi-yeong bread?

673
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,073
-Does your mom know about this?
-She does.

674
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,534
What about your dad? You...

675
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:28,911
I asked him for a favor.

676
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:32,039
I'm leaving.

677
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,085
-Sim-bok, have my yogurt.
-Thanks.

678
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:39,755
I'm leaving too.

679
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,092
Gosh.

680
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:46,428
Stop it.

681
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:48,764
Thank you for everything.

682
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,140
Salute!

683
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:52,601
-All right.
-All right.

684
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:53,644
All right.

685
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:55,938
Bye.

686
00:46:57,814 --> 00:46:59,650
Mr. Oh, how did it go?

687
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:05,447
There's not enough evidence,
so nothing will happen to Jun-u.

688
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,534
-There are no cameras either.
-No.

689
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:11,203
-That's good, I guess.
-"Good"?

690
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:13,622
The vice-principal is furious.

691
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:16,375
He wants Jun-u
to be transferred to another school.

692
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:19,795
But he came here yesterday.
We can't send him away so soon.

693
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:27,886
The vice-principal wants to see me.

694
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,513
I have to go. Talk to Jun-u.

695
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:30,681
Okay.

696
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,485
You skipped lunch, right?

697
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:47,155
Eat it.

698
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:53,620
Thanks.

699
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,125
There's no evidence.

700
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:02,045
And the school is doing its best.
I'm sure everything will be fine.

701
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,339
The academy teacher is not
that cold-hearted either.

702
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:14,308
Do you also think I stole it?

703
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,104
Of course not.

704
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:56,933
Do you also think I stole it?

705
00:48:58,477 --> 00:48:59,603
Of course not.

706
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:04,107
You're scratching yourself again.

707
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:05,984
Mom.

708
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,320
Poor boy.

709
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,993
Never scratch even if it itches.
Your atopy will get worse. Okay?

710
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:17,579
Okay?

711
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:20,582
You're in a good mood today.

712
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,126
Your brother came out on top
in his department again.

713
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:25,420
How can he be so perfect?

714
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:27,881
He beat all those smart Western students.

715
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:30,801
I'm sure Dad is happy.

716
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:32,219
You have no idea.

717
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:35,722
You know he never smiles.
But now, he's grinning from ear to ear.

718
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:37,557
You're happy too, right?

719
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,059
Totally.

720
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,603
I wish every day were like today.

721
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:44,690
I'm happy if you're happy.

722
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:48,652
Study hard. That'll make me happy.

723
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:52,948
Sorry for interrupting you.

724
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:55,867
Study hard.

725
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:00,205
Just do as well as your brother.

726
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:05,711
I love you.

727
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:09,047
Drink this.

728
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:26,106
Jun-u.

729
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:29,317
Can you bring your mother tomorrow?

730
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,167
Good evening, Yeong-bae.

731
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:47,210
-You can leave now.
-Okay.

732
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:48,378
Okay.

733
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:05,729
"I'm Yeong-bae's dad.
Yeong-bae would never do such a thing."

734
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:07,773
-Is that what I should say?
-Yes.

735
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:11,651
It must be hard to go to school
and work at the same time.

736
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:14,404
You could take the high school
qualification exam instead.

737
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:18,325
My parents passed away early,
so I went through a lot too.

738
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,035
-Sir.
-Yes?

739
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,829
My name isn't Park Yeong-bae.

740
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:26,124
Right. It's the name on the vest.

741
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:29,127
That was a long time ago.
I should have known.

742
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:30,921
"Lee Tae-ho."

743
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:32,923
"I'm Tae-ho's dad."

744
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:34,549
That's not my name either.

745
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:35,842
What? Then...

746
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:39,262
Jun-u, where were you?
I've been looking everywhere for you.

747
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,972
-Well, my dad...
-Your mother is here.

748
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:42,808
-Pardon?
-Your mother.

749
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,352
Mom.

750
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:50,106
Your husband is here too.

751
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:53,527
Well...

752
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:55,779
Hi, honey.

753
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:07,415
Well... As I said...

754
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:13,171
With the Education Office
Comprehensive Inspection coming up,

755
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:15,006
this is a critical moment for us.

756
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:18,385
Also, in my opinion...

757
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:21,638
Tae-ho...

758
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,640
It's Jun-u. Choe Jun-u.

759
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:24,683
Okay.

760
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:29,104
Your son seems to be rather soft-hearted.

761
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:33,775
I'm worried the rough kids at this school
will take advantage of him.

762
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,986
I'm afraid there's a possibility

763
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:37,737
that he'll get picked on.

764
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,406
-I didn't--
-I'll make him transfer.

765
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:47,038
I'm working in the countryside anyway,

766
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:49,791
so I'll take him with me.

767
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:54,504
I see. That sounds like a good idea.

768
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:56,256
From what I've experienced,

769
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,759
it's best for emotionally
unstable kids like him

770
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:03,263
to always be with their mothers.

771
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,184
-Sir, do you also agree with her?
-Yes.

772
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,020
I see.

773
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:12,314
Wait.

774
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,566
Ma'am. Ma'am, wait.

775
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:17,444
You don't have to take
such drastic measures.

776
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:21,197
I don't think the vice-principal meant
for him to transfer to another--

777
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:24,534
Do you think I'm avoiding filth
because I'm afraid?

778
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:25,619
Sorry?

779
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,204
She's avoiding it because it's dirty.

780
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:32,542
Jun-u is not someone who steals things.

781
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:35,045
-I know.
-What is a school supposed to be?

782
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:39,174
It's a place that embraces students
in crisis with a warm hug.

783
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,092
His previous school was no different.

784
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:44,137
Schools like this that don't trust
nor embrace students are trash...

785
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:47,974
I mean, schools like this are really...

786
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:51,853
This is totally annoying.

787
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,025
We'll just leave.

788
00:53:57,692 --> 00:54:00,904
But I never suspected Jun-u.

789
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:06,159
I have to look for a house
near my workplace.

790
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:08,244
So I'll take Jun-u with me
in about two days.

791
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:12,457
Until then, please take care of him
for me.

792
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:17,170
-Ma'am...
-Jun-u.

793
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:20,340
I have to get to work now.

794
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,926
Don't be discouraged.
I won't tolerate that.

795
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:30,225
-I'll call you.
-Okay.

796
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,060
-See you.
-Bye.

797
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:38,733
Let's go, honey.

798
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:40,860
-Okay, honey.
-Wait, ma'am.

799
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,906
Ma'am? Can you please reconsider?

800
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:46,449
Watch your step.

801
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:50,328
Goodbye.

802
00:54:57,919 --> 00:54:59,462
Your mother is quite feisty.

803
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,507
You don't take after her, do you?

804
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:11,599
Hey. I heard the transfer student
is transferring again.

805
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,644
What's his issue? Is it his hobby or what?

806
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:17,272
He's lucky he's not going to Juvie.

807
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:18,773
He stole an expensive watch.

808
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,984
Are you sure he's the one who stole it?

809
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:22,861
Who goes to that academy?

810
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:25,947
Hwi-yeong and Sang-hun? Who else?

811
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:32,162
-Hello.
-Hello.

812
00:55:32,328 --> 00:55:34,122
Where did we leave off last time?

813
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:37,333
Mr. Oh.

814
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:39,669
About Jun-u.

815
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:44,007
I don't think it's right
to just send him away like this.

816
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:46,634
Well, nothing's been decided yet, so--

817
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,511
I don't know about the faculty,

818
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:51,598
but we shouldn't be biased against Jun-u.

819
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:53,767
He's our friend.

820
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,101
Right.

821
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:58,772
We should trust Jun-u and be on his side.

822
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:05,361
Jun-u, you shouldn't just leave like this.

823
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,906
I'll talk to the vice-principal
again tomorrow.

824
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:09,282
I'm not leaving now.

825
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:18,041
He's going the day after tomorrow.

826
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:21,169
Since we still have time,
why don't we start studying?

827
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:24,130
The midterm is coming up.
We haven't made any progress!

828
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,259
-It's your fault.
-What should we do?

829
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:31,137
-He's so lame.
-Boo!

830
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,931
Where did we leave off?

831
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:34,307
Page 93.

832
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:47,487
This is our group's presentation material.
Can you look into books for reference?

833
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:50,156
I marked the quotes on the back.

834
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:54,744
You're in our group. If you want to join,
you should at least do this.

835
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,497
-I'm leaving--
-Even if you have to leave,

836
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:00,583
I still wrote down your name
in our group list.

837
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,044
You can go to the library for research.

838
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:07,674
You know where the library is, right?

839
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,726
Aren't you going to take off
that name tag?

840
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:20,770
It's hard to take off.

841
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:26,503
What? What do you want?

842
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:31,716
Hey. You guys can go on ahead.

843
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:33,635
Will you be okay?

844
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:35,637
What do you think?

845
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:38,723
Let's go.

846
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:46,397
Here.

847
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,275
You're already finished?

848
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,735
You can do it by tomorrow.

849
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:52,946
I'm not coming tomorrow.

850
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,282
Didn't you say you're coming
to school until tomorrow?

851
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:59,661
Well, I decided not to come.

852
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:04,123
You just do as you please, don't you?

853
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,501
LEE TAE-HO

854
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:10,463
I'm going to return it now.

855
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,301
Bye, then.

856
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:26,688
-Wait for me.
-Stop following me.

857
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:31,859
Wait for me.

858
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:41,744
My bad.

859
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:43,746
You have to get ready
for Seoul University?

860
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:45,623
Sorry.

861
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:51,254
Where are you?

862
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:53,548
Over here.

863
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,633
GROUP 4
SOO-BIN, DA-HUIN, SO-YE, JUN-U

864
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:59,887
REFERENCE LIST

865
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:02,932
What's taking you so long?

866
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:04,475
I'm on my way.

867
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:08,646
-Where are you?
-Wait.

868
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,857
I'm on Level Four.

869
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,984
Level Four? My gosh.

870
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:17,280
LETTER OF APOLOGY, CHOE JUN-U

871
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:02,784
You're pretty good at drawing.

872
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:07,914
That ladybug looks cute.

873
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:20,343
Can you stand there for a second?

874
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:22,804
Why?

875
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:37,902
Stay still.

876
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:43,783
I won't kill you.

877
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:48,538
Hey, newbie.

878
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:50,623
Are you a ghost?

879
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:54,544
You're barely visible.

880
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:58,423
Don't you resent being a nobody?

881
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,469
It's done.

882
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:05,972
All right. Look, okay?

883
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:19,861
Thanks.

884
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,113
Wait! I'm not done yet.

885
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:35,334
What was your name again?

886
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:37,837
Choe Jun-u.

887
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:45,011
So you do know how to smile.

888
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:49,599
Bye, newbie.

889
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:51,559
I wish you all the best.

890
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:54,854
Keep being a nobody.

891
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:08,159
CHOE JUN-U

892
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:25,718
Is it necessary to be a somebody?

893
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:29,931
I've never cared about
things like that my whole life.

894
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:34,310
Why should I change now?

895
01:03:51,285 --> 01:03:52,328
Seriously?

896
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:55,039
Are you sure Jun-u stole it?

897
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:56,958
Yes, I think so.

898
01:03:59,126 --> 01:04:01,128
Come on. No way.

899
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:03,089
I don't want to believe it either,

900
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:06,133
but Sang-hun said he saw it.

901
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,387
You mean, Jo Sang-hun in the other class?

902
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:11,097
Yes.

903
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:22,567
Jun-u, are you going home?

904
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,237
I explained everything to Mr. Oh.

905
01:04:26,445 --> 01:04:27,655
Let's wait and see what happens.

906
01:04:28,155 --> 01:04:29,407
I have a tutoring session.

907
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:30,616
I'll see you tomorrow.

908
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:40,918
Do you have something to say to me?

909
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:49,468
What is it?

910
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:55,016
Jun-u, I'm running late.

911
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:57,018
Let's talk tomorrow. I'm sorry.

912
01:04:58,352 --> 01:04:59,437
Ma Hwi-yeong.

913
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:01,272
Yes?

914
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:07,862
Jun-u, you see...

915
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:09,488
Why are you putting on an act?

916
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:11,115
What?

917
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:14,535
What are you talking about?

918
01:05:16,662 --> 01:05:17,622
It was you.

919
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:22,460
-You're the one who stole it.
-Stole what?

920
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:25,880
You mean, Mr. Son's watch?

921
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:31,344
Jun-u, don't be so anxious.

922
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:33,346
I said I'll help you.

923
01:05:34,221 --> 01:05:36,307
-So calm down and--
-That day,

924
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:38,726
when you followed me down the stairs,

925
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:42,104
you found the watch
inside the garbage bag and took it.

926
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:45,441
Did you think I didn't know?

927
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:49,487
What are you talking about?

928
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:52,448
Hey, Hwi-yeong!

929
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:53,783
You shit.

930
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:00,665
What will you do?
What will you do if I did it?

931
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:06,337
I want you to be honest with me.

932
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:10,341
Why are you pinning it on me
when you're the one who did it?

933
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:12,677
What will you do about it?

934
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:15,805
What will you do if I did it?
You piece of trash.

935
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:26,357
"Piece of trash"?
Shouldn't you call yourself that?

936
01:06:28,275 --> 01:06:29,360
What?

937
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:31,404
You bastard.

938
01:06:33,614 --> 01:06:34,782
Did you just call me trash?

939
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:02,518
Jun-u, you can be honest with me.

940
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:03,769
Actually, I knew.

941
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:06,022
It must be that guy. The delivery guy.

942
01:07:06,605 --> 01:07:07,815
Did you really have to do this?

943
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:09,066
You were angry.

944
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:10,443
All the treading made you turn.

945
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:11,819
You're only running away!

946
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:14,739
Shouldn't you do your duty
before you leave?

947
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:17,700
Dad? Where does he live?

948
01:07:17,908 --> 01:07:20,411
I'm running away. Why do I keep...

949
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:22,955
running away?

950
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:25,875
You're okay no matter
how badly other people treat you.

951
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:27,084
I pity

952
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:29,045
people like you.

953
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:30,546
I'm sorry, Mom.

954
01:07:36,927 --> 01:07:39,055
