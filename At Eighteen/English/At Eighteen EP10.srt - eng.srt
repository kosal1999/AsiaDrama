1
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,181
Did you believe this?

2
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,602
More than you believe me?

3
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,444
I see.

4
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,372
I did it for you.

5
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,249
I can explain everything.

6
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,095
Jun-u.

7
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,650
Why did you do it?

8
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,821
Didn't you know the truth would be
revealed eventually?

9
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,034
Didn't you think of
how Soo-bin would think of you?

10
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,996
Why do you think she got confused
over a simple text message?

11
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,832
It's because she can't trust you.

12
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,751
The fact that you're a troublemaker
who was forced to transfer

13
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,587
is always in her mind.

14
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,214
Know your place, Jun-u.

15
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,092
You don't deserve Soo-bin.

16
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,511
Don't you feel...

17
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,472
sorry for Soo-bin?

18
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:06,895
You hurt someone that you like.

19
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,064
Isn't Soo-bin

20
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,192
the only person you opened up to?

21
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,862
How could you do that to her?

22
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,531
Shut up. Shut your mouth, Jun-u.

23
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,743
What do you know?

24
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,998
What do you know?

25
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,222
Stupid.

26
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,349
You should've believed him.

27
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:05,787
O-je,

28
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,081
do you know where Jun-u lives?

29
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:45,827
What if he asks...
What if he asks why I'm here?

30
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,203
No.

31
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,289
-Choe Jun--
-Jun-u.

32
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,082
What are you doing up there?

33
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,292
Hey, Mom.

34
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,927
-Give that to me.
-Okay.

35
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,971
What is all this stuff?

36
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,140
I need to make some side dishes
for tomorrow.

37
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,766
For the restaurant you work at?

38
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,685
Why do you make them yourself?

39
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:13,396
I'm learning some cooking secrets
there lately.

40
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,189
The chef gave me some homework to do.

41
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:18,651
I should study hard
until my restaurant's renovation's done.

42
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,487
Jun-u.

43
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,199
Is something wrong?

44
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,659
What's wrong with your face?

45
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,119
It's nothing.

46
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,246
Don't lie.

47
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,123
It's written all over your face.

48
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:35,168
"I'm having a terrible day.
Don't bother me."

49
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:36,836
That's not true.

50
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,047
Let's go inside.

51
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,023
Are you at Chan-yeol's house?

52
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,484
Do you know what time it is? Hurry home.

53
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,303
Jun-u, I'm sorry for not trusting you.

54
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,537
It's my fault.

55
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,914
For not being someone you can trust.

56
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,421
No. I should've asked you first,

57
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,965
but I didn't.

58
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,716
Because...

59
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,803
No matter how much I think about it,

60
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,930
I don't think I deserve

61
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,640
to go out with you.

62
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,146
I DON'T THINK I DESERVE TO GO OUT WITH YOU

63
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,078
Are you okay?

64
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,373
What about you?

65
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,051
I think I'll need some time.

66
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,011
Can you understand?

67
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,014
Please don't take too long.

68
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,475
I'm sorry.

69
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,902
The total amount of mechanical energy

70
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:33,072
of a moving object remains constant.

71
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,701
-Do you guys like roller coasters?
-Yes.

72
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:41,122
Roller coasters are a great example
of the transformation

73
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,082
between kinetic and potential energy.

74
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:46,127
Even though a roller coaster
does not have an engine,

75
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,130
it can move up and down the track.

76
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,132
-It's thanks to...
-What's going on?

77
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,508
-...energy transformation.
-No idea.

78
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,969
As a roller coaster

79
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:57,430
moves down,

80
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,265
its potential energy decreases

81
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,225
while its kinetic energy increases.

82
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,476
Let's see.

83
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,480
"A 10kg object resting on the ground..."

84
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,030
Soo-bin.

85
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,782
Why are you not getting mad at me?

86
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,037
You know that I lied to you.

87
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,624
Getting angry at you now
doesn't change anything.

88
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,418
Right now,

89
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,922
I'm trying my best to understand

90
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,799
from the perspective

91
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,011
of my old friend, Little Boy Hwi-yeong.

92
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,059
"He probably couldn't help it."

93
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,728
That's what I'm telling myself.

94
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,525
Soo-bin.

95
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,111
Hwi-yeong.

96
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,701
I want...

97
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,664
you to give some thought...

98
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,793
to how you feel about me.

99
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,463
How you really feel about me.

100
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,718
Whether you did it because you liked me...

101
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,390
or there was another reason.

102
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,234
I was almost suffocated to death.

103
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,652
What's going on between you guys?

104
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,070
Exactly.

105
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,822
What's going on?

106
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,243
We decided to go back to being friends.

107
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:43,786
Really?

108
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,790
I understand.

109
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,793
It'd be practically impossible
to slip under your mom's radar.

110
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:54,130
I think it might be better
for Jun-u's sake.

111
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,717
So-ye, haven't you made up
with Gi-tae yet?

112
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,637
How could she forgive him?

113
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,432
He chose friendship over love.

114
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,268
What friendship? What love?

115
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,104
He just decided to fulfill his duty

116
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,314
as Hwi-yeong's butler.

117
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:18,821
What are you guys doing?

118
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,949
Are you guys officially leaving me out?

119
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,535
Did you just find out?

120
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,163
We looked for you,
but we couldn't find you.

121
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,832
It's over between you and Jun-u, right?

122
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:33,878
I guess it is.

123
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,091
Gosh, what should I do with her?

124
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,553
This is so tasty.

125
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,600
-Hwi-yeong did that?
-Yes.

126
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,687
Isn't it unbelievable?
Isn't it so childish?

127
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,816
Well, it is shocking

128
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,568
and extremely childish,

129
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,112
but I guess it is understandable.

130
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,077
He probably lost his reason
for a second...

131
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:12,249
-O-je.
-I'm just saying it could happen.

132
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,835
Just go talk things out with Soo-bin.

133
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,339
There's no need to complicate things
by overanalyzing--

134
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,969
-Pil-sang!
-Gosh, Pil-sang.

135
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,892
Didn't I tell you to stop?

136
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,187
Pil-sang, Jun-u has eyes
in the back of his head.

137
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,813
You should stop, okay?

138
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,273
Pil-sang.

139
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:40,653
Instead of doing this to me,
go talk to Ro-mi.

140
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,364
-Go ask her out.
-Am I crazy?

141
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,200
She'd kill me.

142
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,327
Would you rather die or go out with her?

143
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,707
Pluck up your courage.
You're not dead yet.

144
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,256
Ro-mi.

145
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,216
I like you.

146
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,093
I know. Stop liking me.

147
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,219
I want to go out with you.

148
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,721
-No.
-Don't say no just yet.

149
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,475
Please think it over for a few days
about letting me be your boyfriend.

150
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,227
I beg you.

151
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,647
Please answer
before the end of the school trip.

152
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,193
Gosh, Pil-sang is pretty impressive.

153
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,081
Jun-u, good job.

154
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:35,958
"Pluck up your courage.

155
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,918
You're not dead yet."

156
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,631
I thought it was a scene from a drama.

157
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:43,924
You're exaggerating.

158
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,433
I can't believe myself.

159
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,852
Who am I to give advice?

160
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,522
When I can't do that myself.

161
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,443
So? Did you keep calling Mr. Kim

162
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:05,321
to find out about this?

163
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,281
What were you trying to dig up?

164
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,418
The number you have dialed does not exist.

165
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,254
Please check the number again.

166
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,927
Mr. Oh, someone is here to see you.

167
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,220
Me?

168
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,101
Hi.

169
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,858
Oh, okay.

170
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:49,281
I wanted to bring it over sooner,
but I had a job interview.

171
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,368
Thank you for coming here yourself
when you're busy.

172
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,537
-I'm not busy.
-I see.

173
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,458
The interview must have gone well.
You look happy.

174
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,629
-I failed it.
-I'm sorry.

175
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:07,257
Bye, then.

176
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,178
-Wait, Ji-min!
-Yes?

177
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,599
-The other day
-Yes, I called a cab for you then

178
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:16,850
and brought your bag today.

179
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,520
If you want to thank me
with food or drinks, there's no need.

180
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,855
-Then what about...
-What about

181
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,524
a cup of coffee?

182
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,443
I'm a little busy.

183
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:27,987
Have a nice day.

184
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,238
That's not it.

185
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,366
Food, drinks, coffee... None of that.

186
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,914
"I'm interested in you.

187
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,332
I'd like to ask you out."

188
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,627
If that's what you want to say,
my answer is an even bigger no.

189
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,629
That's not it either.

190
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:51,260
The other day,
you seemed to be having a hard time.

191
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,846
I want you to hang in there.

192
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,015
Everything will be all right.

193
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,392
Thank you for bringing my bag. Bye.

194
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,564
It doesn't have to be today.

195
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,900
Gosh, dragonflies.

196
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,785
Guys, I have some good news.

197
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:22,249
Our class vice president, Jun-u's idea

198
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:25,461
has been chosen as the main event

199
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,754
of the 2nd-grade school trip.

200
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,130
Give him a big hand!

201
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,431
-Why is he so excited?
-I don't know.

202
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,766
Well...

203
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,771
While we're at it, let's prepare well

204
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:46,148
and become the winner of the event.

205
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,317
The first prize is an air purifier.

206
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,444
Let's do this, guys!

207
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,989
He must want an air purifier so badly.

208
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,284
He startled me.

209
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,037
An air purifier...

210
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,425
I knew it.

211
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,769
All of Dad's clothes are gone.

212
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:28,732
Why would I keep old clothes?
I've thrown them all away.

213
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,819
I still need them.

214
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,112
Then buy one.

215
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:37,658
How can I buy
clothes filled with your fond memories?

216
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,493
My goodness.

217
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,036
Let me take a look when I get home.

218
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,789
I wish you cared as much
about your studies as this.

219
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,415
Hello?

220
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,877
She hung up on me. Unbelievable.

221
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,839
-Is it for the school-trip costume?
-Yes.

222
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:56,510
-That idea was my Jun--
-I wonder who came up with the idea.

223
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,887
I'm sure it's a kid
who doesn't care about studying.

224
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:04,601
You didn't have to do this. We could
have eaten at a restaurant.

225
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,395
You eat out all the time.

226
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,314
As you can't use your hand...

227
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,358
Thank you.

228
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:15,863
I'm sure you were popular with guys
when you were younger.

229
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,406
Not at all.

230
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,159
I've had only one boyfriend.

231
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,369
It was Jun-u's dad. He was my first love.

232
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,329
Really? I see.

233
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,332
Have you not dated anyone else
after you broke up?

234
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,877
Well, I dated a few guys,

235
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,170
but I didn't like any of them.

236
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,755
No one came close to Jun-u's dad.

237
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,177
-Thank you.
-Sure.

238
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,308
What will your son do
about the school-trip outfit?

239
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,852
He has his dad's clothes.

240
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,854
I left one to remember him by.

241
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,231
To remember him by?

242
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,111
It's what your dad wore on our first date.

243
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,572
He looked so dashing that day.

244
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,119
Still, they must have loved each other

245
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,706
back then, at that moment.

246
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,303
May I come in, Mom?

247
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,555
Just a minute.

248
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,603
What is it?

249
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,444
What?

250
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,905
You don't have time to waste on that.

251
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,783
Soo-bin's in charge, isn't she?

252
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,243
So you're trying to help her?

253
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,661
No.

254
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:46,995
I'm the class president,

255
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,539
so I should at least help
the kids prepare for the event.

256
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,584
Go up and study. I'll get it ready.

257
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,882
What if your father finds out?

258
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,594
Hi, Mr. Park. It's me, Park Geum-ja.

259
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,222
Make a suit for Hwi-yeong.

260
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,060
Yes, good. A retro style.

261
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,647
-I can't wait.
-I'm so excited.

262
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,815
Right?

263
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,239
Da-huin, are you going on your honeymoon?

264
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,032
Of course.

265
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,576
-Seriously, don't overdo it.
-Wait.

266
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,120
Ro-mi, looking good.

267
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,080
What's this now?

268
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:33,083
Seriously. What's with everyone?

269
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,629
Hey. Good morning, everyone.

270
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,506
Is everyone here?

271
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,301
Hwi-yeong, Jun-u, please do a headcount.

272
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,552
-Sure.
-Good.

273
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,888
You look great, Mr. Oh.

274
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,811
-Hey, isn't that Sang-hun?
-You're right.

275
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,823
-Didn't he go to Singapore?
-What?

276
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,158
Hi, guys.

277
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,577
Sang-hun, what are you doing here?

278
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,288
Hello. I wanted to go
on the school trip too,

279
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,957
so I hopped on a swan boat in Singapore
to come here.

280
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,668
What? What's going on?

281
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,211
I'll tell you later.

282
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,923
-Hey.
-Hi, guys!

283
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,593
-Sang-hun.
-Hey!

284
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,221
Okay. Let's get on the bus.

285
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,140
Don't get on another class's bus.

286
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,685
Okay. Where should I sit?

287
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,312
I'll sit here.

288
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:36,396
Go.

289
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:41,818
Pil-sang,

290
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,821
just grab a seat. Accept it.

291
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,158
Let's go.

292
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,663
Jun-u, sit here.

293
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,958
Look at that witch.

294
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,382
I'll sit in the back.

295
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,223
What's this?

296
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,391
You have nothing to fear?

297
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,268
Let's keep moving.

298
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,812
Hurry up, you punk.

299
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,105
I'm going.

300
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:25,654
-When are we leaving?
-Soon?

301
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:30,158
What's this? Sang-hun didn't transfer out.

302
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,576
He never filed the papers.

303
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:32,661
-Really?
-Yes.

304
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,621
-It's true.
-It's true.

305
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:35,705
Yes.

306
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,797
So excited

307
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,049
-Yes.
-And we're off.

308
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,552
Be more animated.

309
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,638
-Yes.
-I'm so hungry.

310
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,056
I'm so excited.

311
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:56,935
And we're off.

312
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,395
And we're off!

313
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,313
I'm sorry.

314
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:04,818
I'm hungry.

315
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,444
I skipped breakfast.

316
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,530
Hey. I have food.

317
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,866
You do? Let me have some.

318
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,202
Look how pretty.

319
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,329
Oh, my god. I can't eat this.

320
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,455
What is that?

321
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,542
What is that?

322
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,169
Jun-u, what is that? I want one too.

323
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:25,338
Okay. Here. Take one, Ro-mi.

324
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,882
Hey, me too.

325
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:29,593
Why do yours look the same?

326
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:30,677
Let me see.

327
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,679
-They're the same.
-What's this?

328
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:34,556
They are.

329
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:39,811
Here, take this.

330
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,272
-What is it?
-My driver made them.

331
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,356
Thanks.

332
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,904
See? These are pigs, and so are these.

333
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,197
Share these with your friends.

334
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,781
I made them last night.

335
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,117
I haven't had your rice balls in a while.

336
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,327
Thanks.

337
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,384
Hwi-yeong, Jun-u, check on the kids.

338
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,762
-Bring your luggage.
-Where do we get the keys?

339
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,222
There. Over there.

340
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:16,765
What?

341
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:23,563
So, is this where Ro-mi and I
are staying tonight?

342
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,734
Take your bag.

343
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,673
You came.

344
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:53,134
Don't get too excited.
I didn't come because of you.

345
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,096
Don't smile. Punk.

346
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:08,358
What a great view.

347
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,279
Look at this.

348
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,197
It's not that good.

349
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:21,538
When do you plan to wear all of them?

350
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,498
I can wear them all.

351
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,125
How many did you bring?

352
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,502
Just make up with him.

353
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,338
He's walking on eggshells around you.

354
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,173
Look who's talking.

355
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,384
But we didn't fight.

356
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,095
Neither did we.

357
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,515
Cheonbong High School students,
please come to the main hall.

358
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:42,100
WELCOME
CHEONBONG HIGH SCHOOL TRIP

359
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,105
Five!

360
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,858
Five!

361
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,234
-Hurry!
-Chan-yeol!

362
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,615
Yes, we made it.

363
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,172
Okay, you guys are out.

364
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:14,049
Separate. Again.

365
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:17,218
Ready? Start!

366
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,829
Two!

367
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,123
Two people!

368
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:08,061
Those who are left alone, please step out.

369
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:11,523
Those who are left alone,
you're out of the game.

370
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:14,234
All right, great job.

371
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,403
Who is still standing?

372
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,823
Hi.

373
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:29,332
Da-huin.

374
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,252
Here you are.
I was looking all over for you.

375
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,755
O-je. Give me this hat.

376
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,298
This is totally my style.

377
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:44,723
Hey. How could you flirt
with every single guy?

378
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,349
What?

379
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,684
Da-huin.

380
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:51,563
Give me that.

381
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:54,649
Did you just hit me?

382
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,693
No, I was just trying to take off
the hat--

383
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:57,902
Hey, Ro-mi.

384
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,280
You little...

385
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,617
-Guys!
-Let go of me!

386
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,287
What's wrong? What's the matter?

387
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,872
-Hey!
-Let go!

388
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,666
-Ro-mi!
-Stop it!

389
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,460
Move!

390
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,879
Hey, cut it out.

391
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:19,883
-Hey!
-Stop it!

392
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,342
Hold on. Time out!

393
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,303
-Come over here!
-Hit me instead.

394
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:27,724
Hey, stop it.

395
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,310
-Please, stop it!
-Hey!

396
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:31,603
Get lost!

397
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,913
Guys, let's go have dinner.

398
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,831
-No.
-No.

399
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,632
Da-huin, open the door.

400
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,718
It's O-je.

401
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,641
Don't open it.

402
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,102
Da-huin.

403
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,608
Da-huin. I know you're in there.

404
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:21,569
What if O-je gets caught
inside the girls' wing?

405
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,412
Da-huin.

406
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:33,289
Sorry, O-je.

407
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:37,544
So-ye.

408
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:59,399
Soo-bin. Shall we go have dinner?

409
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,863
-I can carry it now.
-Okay.

410
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,365
You don't have to come tomorrow.
I have a business trip to Japan.

411
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:09,409
Okay, have a nice trip.

412
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:10,910
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

413
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:13,788
Song-hui.

414
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:18,585
Why are you here?

415
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,545
I know Soo-bin's on a school trip.

416
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:23,756
How could she be so cold to me

417
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,593
for three days straight?
Her daughter isn't like her.

418
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,762
Oh, this.

419
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,941
-Hello, Ms. Yoon.
-Hello.

420
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,113
I'm not getting a divorce.
I won't let that happen.

421
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,406
How many times do I tell you?

422
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:51,784
You know how important this period
is for Soo-bin. Are you crazy?

423
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,662
Soo-bin will understand.

424
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,956
In order for me to move
to the States next year,

425
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,666
I need to take care of the documents now.

426
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,586
Why? To get married to that wench?

427
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:05,298
Song-hui.
Let's stop putting on a show now.

428
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,216
Pretending to be warm parents
in front of Soo-bin,

429
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,385
and a couple in love
in front of everyone else.

430
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:13,348
I hate putting on a show too.
Who said that I liked it?

431
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,350
But I won't get divorced.

432
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:19,604
I will never get divorced
until Soo-bin goes to university.

433
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,315
Stop using Soo-bin as an excuse.

434
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,400
Why don't you just beg me
to come back to you?

435
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,818
What on earth...

436
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,780
You act like you're so much better
than others

437
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,323
and act so cool.

438
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:32,867
I'm sick and tired of it.

439
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,912
Beg who? Do you think I still love you?

440
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,706
You spent the money I made
to get your degrees.

441
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,916
Do you feel confident now?

442
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,168
It's you who should be--
Gosh, seriously...

443
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:45,254
You're the one who should be more honest.

444
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,923
You feel better when you live

445
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:49,467
with a woman who's less smart
and less competent than me.

446
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,470
Why can't you be honest and tell me
that's why you're leaving?

447
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,723
Why are you asking if you already know?

448
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,517
Make your decision by next week.

449
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,185
If you don't,
I'll file a suit for divorce.

450
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:20,581
Seriously... Why?

451
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,846
What are you doing here?

452
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,851
You should go inside, Ms. Yoon.

453
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:44,480
No, I'm fine.

454
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:46,816
Da-huin.

455
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,444
It's a misunderstanding.

456
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,237
I'm not interested in Ro-mi.

457
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,156
Then why did you stare at her?

458
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:55,033
I didn't stare at her.

459
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,745
And about the hat,
Ro-mi just took it from me.

460
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,830
She always acts as she pleases.

461
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,082
I really mean it.

462
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,835
I'm not interested in any other girls.

463
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,754
You're the only one I'm close with.

464
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:08,921
Really?

465
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,548
Yes.

466
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,301
Then do you like me the most?

467
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,261
-What?
-Do you like me?

468
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,100
It's the PE teacher.

469
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,064
That was close.

470
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,864
-Da-huin.
-You're so cute.

471
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,741
I love you, O-je.

472
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:41,829
I know how pathetic I am.

473
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,833
All I do is follow Hwi-yeong around
and worry about what he thinks,

474
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,294
believing that
I could become someone like him.

475
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:51,547
Gi-tae.

476
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,674
I know I'm a loser.

477
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,470
I'm such a loser, so maybe
I don't have the right to like you,

478
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:59,388
but I still do.

479
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:02,391
I really like you.

480
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,644
I really like you, So-ye.

481
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:08,272
But when you treat me so coldly like this,

482
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,859
I can't stand it, So-ye.

483
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:17,490
Get up. Come on, get up.

484
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,746
I'll change from now on, So-ye.

485
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:28,793
Make sure each class takes
their snacks and beverages.

486
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:32,547
-Class One. Over here.
-Take one box each.

487
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:35,758
Hwi-yeong.

488
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,720
Are you disappointed that I came back?

489
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,598
-I don't care.
-I know you do.

490
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,101
You must be terribly afraid.

491
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:48,771
What?

492
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,441
I'm joking.

493
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,986
I feel so thankful to your dad.

494
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,946
He gave my dad a promotion

495
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,865
and let me stay here.

496
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,199
What an angel.

497
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,660
How could I repay his kindness?

498
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,708
Let's have fun, my friend.
I'm looking forward to it.

499
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,463
Let's go.

500
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:22,930
Are you happy? Do you feel satisfied now?

501
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,021
What do you think?

502
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,315
Soo-bin is still having a tough time.

503
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:55,796
Hwi-yeong.

504
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,591
I'll help you.

505
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:01,427
You should've called me earlier.

506
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,387
Never mind.

507
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,615
Hurry up, guys.

508
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:23,866
We're here.

509
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,118
Hurry up and grill the meat.

510
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,748
My family has a villa in Santa Monica.

511
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,333
Santa Monica? You're so cool.

512
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:35,002
I remember throwing a barbecue party
in the garden there.

513
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:39,131
Did you do nothing but blabber
in your villa in Santa Monica as well?

514
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,925
Not helping out at all?

515
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,347
Hey, Ro-mi. You're just
a big fat liar, aren't you?

516
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,891
Didn't you say your dad is
the director of Jaeyoung Hospital?

517
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:50,893
Hey.

518
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:52,812
Come here.

519
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,773
Your dad is the director's driver.

520
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,566
How dare you tell such a lie?

521
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,736
You almost fooled all the moms too.

522
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:01,821
I knew it.

523
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:04,657
You said your mom travels abroad
for conferences all the time.

524
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,951
Is your mom being a professor also a lie?

525
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,078
Pil-sang, this is your chance. Go to her.

526
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,454
What?

527
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:13,207
He doesn't want to embarrass Ro-mi.

528
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,043
Seo-jin, don't do this here.

529
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,795
-Talk to her some other time.
-Let go of me.

530
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,714
Isn't it funny?
Her dad is not even a doctor.

531
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:20,840
Hey!

532
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,759
Her dad is a doctor.

533
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,511
-What?
-The last time my mom got sick,

534
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,179
she was treated by Ro-mi's dad.

535
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,641
Why are you making a scene
with some nonsense you heard?

536
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,269
Cut it out, Da-huin.
I don't need your help.

537
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:36,355
You're right.
My dad is not a hospital director.

538
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,566
I made it up.

539
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,359
What's the big deal?

540
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:43,946
Saying I was pretty and smart
like my hospital director dad,

541
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,907
you were the one who envied me
and sang my praises.

542
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,618
-Am I wrong?
-You shouldn't have lied.

543
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,078
You shouldn't have been fooled.

544
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,080
Blame yourself for falling for my lies.

545
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,334
Ro-mi!

546
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,377
Don't follow me.

547
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,141
You woke up.

548
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,809
Have some porridge.

549
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:18,230
Please just leave it here.
I'll eat it later.

550
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,565
-Okay.
-Thanks.

551
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,407
I'll be going now.

552
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,533
Okay.

553
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,287
Yeon-u.

554
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,168
Well...

555
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:42,296
You don't have to work for me anymore.

556
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,257
But your hand hasn't recovered yet.

557
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:48,052
I'll help you a few more days
when you get back from your trip.

558
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,179
I can take a cab.

559
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,014
I'd be too embarrassed to see you.

560
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,682
Don't say that.

561
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,351
Please do as I say.

562
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,360
All right.
What we're going to do next is...

563
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:11,117
Truth Hearing! And we're off!

564
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,453
Well...

565
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:18,791
Let me see.

566
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:22,962
Gi-tae! Let's start with Gi-tae!

567
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,547
Come sit here.

568
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:26,966
Come on.

569
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:30,553
Guys, ask him anything you want, okay?

570
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:34,265
Well, you disappeared for a moment
right before dinner.

571
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,225
Where were you?

572
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,436
I had a talk with So-ye.

573
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:44,775
Then, what did you two talk about?

574
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,404
I made a big mistake.

575
00:40:57,913 --> 00:41:00,749
Hey, what are you doing here?

576
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:01,876
Come join us.

577
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,043
I'm okay.

578
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,296
Tell me when you need me. I can help.

579
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:10,092
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

580
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:13,804
I actually need you right now.

581
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:18,851
I mean, it's so boring without you.
So boring.

582
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,230
Let's go. Come with me.

583
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:26,066
Come join our Truth Hearing.

584
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:29,236
The most humiliating thing
that's happened in my life?

585
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,451
Back in elementary school,

586
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,204
I peed my pants in class once.

587
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,247
-What grade?
-What grade?

588
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,415
I was in fifth grade.

589
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,042
-Fifth grade?
-Really?

590
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,126
Unbelievable.

591
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,464
Are you in love with anyone right now?

592
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,759
-Gosh.
-Seriously.

593
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,385
Hold on. It doesn't count.

594
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,554
The answer is already decided.
It doesn't count.

595
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:01,393
Come on.

596
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:07,358
Are you in love with someone
who you shouldn't love?

597
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,037
Let's move on, guys.

598
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,122
Why? Let's hear his answer.

599
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,250
Forget it. Let's move on.

600
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,501
-What is this?
-Are you crying?

601
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,461
What's wrong?

602
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,171
Ro-mi!

603
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,632
-Ro-mi!
-I'll do it instead.

604
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,259
Why? Go back to your seat.

605
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,135
-What are you doing?
-Leave Ro-mi alone.

606
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,013
-Fine.
-I'll do it.

607
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,473
You do it.

608
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:42,309
Pil-sang, come back.

609
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,311
Go back to your seat.

610
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,274
You all saw earlier, right?

611
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,026
I'm a big, fat liar.

612
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,281
I don't deserve to participate
in this game.

613
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:56,657
So I refuse.

614
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:58,450
-Da-huin.
-I'll pick one.

615
00:42:58,534 --> 00:42:59,702
-Gosh.
-What happened?

616
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,245
Soo-bin.

617
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,956
Soo-bin!

618
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,505
Do you still like Jun-u?

619
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:19,138
That was straightforward.

620
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:21,432
Do you?

621
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,517
Answer right now!

622
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,357
All right then.

623
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:33,027
There's no exception.

624
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:39,033
-Five, four, three, two, one!
-Five, four, three, two, one!

625
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,850
Gosh.

626
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,478
I ate too much today.

627
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,486
She's a real sociopath.

628
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,112
After being humiliated like that...

629
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,280
Chan-yeol.

630
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,115
I can hear you.

631
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,743
I'll never try to defend her again.

632
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,286
Exactly.

633
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,954
Never try to defend me again.

634
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,289
Gosh, are you serious?

635
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:30,918
Calm down. Leg exercise.

636
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:33,337
She's so annoying.

637
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:35,547
My stomach hurts.

638
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:33,188
JUN-U

639
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:35,274
Soo-bin, sleep tight.

640
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,713
-Gosh.
-What's this?

641
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:59,381
Pil-sang, please don't.

642
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,966
-It's not me.
-Just don't!

643
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,926
Who is it? Come on!

644
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,179
-Come on!
-Please stop.

645
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,388
It wasn't me!

646
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,616
Can't you guys fall asleep?

647
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:29,286
Why are you still up?

648
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:32,706
Maybe it's because I'm away from home.

649
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:37,878
I can't sleep either.

650
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:39,546
It's driving me crazy.

651
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:50,933
Ro-mi, are you crying?

652
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:55,229
Cry all you want.

653
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:58,732
I take back calling you a sociopath.

654
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:00,859
So you do have a conscience.

655
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:05,489
Seo-jin or whatever her name is.
Forget her.

656
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:18,293
Hey!

657
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:54,746
CHEONBONG HIGH SCHOOL

658
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,499
Okay. Next up is from Class Three.

659
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:01,128
Here's the outsider, Yoo Pil-sang.

660
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,462
-Come out!
-What about Dong?

661
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,590
Did he join at the last minute?

662
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:12,889
Hello. I'm the most desired guy
in Cheonbong High,

663
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:14,349
Yoo Pil-sang.

664
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:17,686
-You're so cute!
-I'll do impressions.

665
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:19,938
First, Cheonbong's vice principal.

666
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,317
-Let's go.
-Hey.

667
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:27,237
-Are you nervous?
-No, that's not it.

668
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:30,991
-What's going on?
-I feel diarrhea coming on.

669
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,909
But you're next.

670
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,580
Hold it in. You can do it.

671
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,832
-You can do it.
-I can do it.

672
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:39,958
I can do it.

673
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,710
I can do it. I can't do it.

674
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:44,004
I don't think I can. I can't do it.

675
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,547
I'll go while singing.

676
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,174
You can sing, right?

677
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,843
You're good, right? I hope you're good.

678
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:51,345
Good luck.

679
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:54,973
Dong.

680
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:00,729
Okay. Next up is Go Dong.

681
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,106
He will finally take the stage.

682
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:07,027
-Please give him a big hand!
-Come out, Dong!

683
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:09,613
Come out!

684
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:11,615
Come out!

685
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:13,450
-Hurry up!
-Come out!

686
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:14,534
Dong!

687
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,287
-Are you not ready?
-Why aren't you coming out?

688
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:20,415
-Go Dong is coming--
-Come out, Dong!

689
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,209
Why is Jun-u coming out?

690
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,086
-It's Jun-u.
-That's not Dong.

691
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:25,796
-Is that you, Jun-u?
-It's Jun-u.

692
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:27,631
-What?
-Jun-u? Why?

693
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:30,384
-Why is Jun-u...
-In Go Dong's place,

694
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:33,387
-Choe Jun-u will take the stage.
-What's going on?

695
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:36,390
-Okay. Give him a warm hand!
-Yes.

696
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:39,267
Jun-u!

697
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:43,438
Why am I nervous?

698
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:47,359
Dance for us!

699
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:02,374
From far, far away

700
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:06,378
She comes to me

701
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:15,971
What do I do about my trembling heart?

702
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:19,891
How do I describe it?

703
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:23,228
You

704
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:27,983
Stole my heart

705
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:31,570
From the start

706
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:35,574
And gave me

707
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:38,744
An incurable disease

708
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:41,872
I want to be

709
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:44,416
A plant

710
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,920
I will be a plant

711
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:52,299
On your small windowsill

712
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:55,761
Even if I can't say a word

713
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:59,222
Even if I can't wish for anything

714
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:02,476
Every so often I will receive

715
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,937
Your smile and your touch

716
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:09,649
And watch you as you sleep

717
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:15,822
As much as I want

718
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:19,451
Nice!

719
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,915
Excuse me! You in the checkered shirt...

720
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:26,208
Are you all right?

721
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:29,836
Don't you resent

722
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,838
being a nobody?

723
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:42,516
I like you too.

724
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:46,061
I will be a plant

725
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:49,439
On your small windowsill

726
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:52,859
Even if I can't say a word

727
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:56,321
Even if I can't wish for anything

728
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:59,741
Every so often I will receive

729
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:03,119
Your smile and your touch

730
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:06,748
And watch you as you sleep

731
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:13,338
As much as I want

732
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,433
DANCING IN THE RETRO NIGHT

733
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:35,170
Pil-sang, come with me.

734
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:52,854
If you haven't decided yet,

735
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:55,607
you can tell me later.

736
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,275
No, I'll tell you now.

737
00:53:58,401 --> 00:53:59,486
Pil-sang.

738
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:02,530
You're not my type.

739
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:03,907
Totally not,

740
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,450
so stop dreaming.

741
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:09,496
What must I do...
What must I do to make you like me?

742
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,873
I... I'll try. I'll do anything.

743
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:13,708
Don't try.

744
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,377
You can try for 10, 20, 100 years...

745
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,337
No, even if we meet again
in another lifetime,

746
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,464
you'll never be my boyfriend.

747
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,217
Find someone else.

748
00:54:41,277 --> 00:54:42,320
Gi-tae.

749
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:44,364
Let's end things here.

750
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:45,699
What?

751
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,373
Let's break up.

752
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:55,750
Why?

753
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:59,671
You will never change.

754
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:02,882
And I'll keep hating that.

755
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:08,346
Hwi-yeong.

756
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:11,433
I want you to give some thought...

757
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,060
to how you feel about me.

758
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:16,021
How you really feel about me.

759
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:18,148
Whether you did it because you liked me

760
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:19,941
or there was another reason.

761
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:23,445
I don't care what that feeling is.

762
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,071
What's important is...

763
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:27,741
I won't let Jun-u take anything away
from me.

764
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,493
I can't.

765
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:13,953
Jun-u.

766
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,956
I'm sorry for not trusting you.

767
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:23,421
I'm sorry for making you not trust me.

768
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:36,684
Stay beside me.

769
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,064
You guys were all happy, right? Dismissed!

770
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:23,982
Shall we go?

771
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:25,733
I miss you more,

772
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:28,069
and also,
I keep wanting to know more about you.

773
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,071
Don't worry about Jun-u,

774
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:32,740
and rest in peace. I'll look after him.

775
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:35,160
I'm doing well. I'm happy.

776
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,998
What has changed for you
since we started going out?

777
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:41,374
I keep looking in the mirror.

778
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,418
My reflection looks so excited.

779
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:44,878
Like stroking your hair.

780
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:47,464
I think we should pull Soo-bin
out of the private lesson team.

781
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,007
-Ms. Park.
-What are you doing?

782
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,675
Did you do something to offend Hwi-yeong?

783
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:52,343
I asked my mom
to pull you out of the team.

784
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,637
I thought seeing you at every session
would be too hard for me.

785
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,306
Guys, you're here.

786
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:58,725
Aren't you...

787
00:57:58,808 --> 00:57:59,893
Hello, ma'am.

788
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,145
Even if we're friends, this seems wrong.

789
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:04,189
Why don't you come inside for some water?

790
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:05,482
My mom is at work now.

791
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,317
Hey! Hey, hurry.

792
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:08,651
Come over here!

793
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:22,207
