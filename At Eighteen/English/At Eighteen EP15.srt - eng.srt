1
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,170
I'm sorry.

2
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,122
Why?

3
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:05,583
Jun-u,

4
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,336
I'll just go alone today.

5
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,132
It's really okay.

6
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,885
But I want to walk you home today.

7
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,890
It's my birthday, and...

8
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,310
I don't want to send you alone.

9
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,234
Okay.

10
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:54,757
Go on in.

11
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,719
Okay. Thanks for walking me home.

12
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,930
I was worried you might get lost.

13
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,188
I'm sorry about earlier.

14
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,233
For saying that
without thinking about your feelings.

15
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:16,738
Me too.

16
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,781
I know how you feel.

17
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,284
You were worried
I might be scolded by my mom.

18
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:24,037
And whether my mom finds out or not,

19
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,081
you just wanted to keep your promise.

20
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,837
Thank you for today.

21
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:36,132
It was the best birthday of my life.

22
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,134
Really?

23
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,181
See you.

24
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:44,515
Okay.

25
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,735
Jun-u, happy birthday.

26
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,403
Thank you.

27
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,239
You should go now.

28
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,798
You're home early, Mom.

29
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,633
Yes.

30
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,886
My meeting ended early today.

31
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,307
She wasn't waiting for me today.

32
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,226
I know.

33
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,728
I told her to quit.

34
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:34,983
I thought about it, and it felt like
I was too harsh on you.

35
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,485
And your grades improved this time.

36
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,737
Mom, actually,

37
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,366
today was Jun-u's birthday.

38
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:47,245
I know I shouldn't have broken
the promise I made with you,

39
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,497
but I wanted to celebrate his birthday,

40
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,457
so I went to Jun-u's home.

41
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,043
I begged her to let me go.

42
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,920
I didn't go alone.

43
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,880
I went with Chan-yeol, Da-huin,

44
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,049
and everyone else.

45
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:01,801
I'm sorry.

46
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,809
You knew you shouldn't have
broken your promise.

47
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,853
But why did you?

48
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,567
Because I like Jun-u.

49
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,946
From now on, I'll keep
all the promises I made with you.

50
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,366
I'll attend the academy and
private lessons you found for me.

51
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,410
And like you want...

52
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:33,124
No, I'll do better on my own.

53
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,585
Okay.

54
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,754
Fine.

55
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,549
You said you'd do better on your own.

56
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,223
You have a math level test today,
but forget it if you don't want to.

57
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,520
I'll take it.
Thank you for finding it for me.

58
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,190
What time is the test?
I should get ready right away.

59
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,316
Soo-bin.

60
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,446
Take this. I know it's uncomfortable
without it.

61
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,919
Song-hui, how have you been?

62
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,421
Gosh, I called you several times,

63
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,757
but you never called me back.
I was so disappointed.

64
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,175
Oh, I was busy.

65
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,677
I'm on my way to Seoul right now.

66
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:30,098
I made some side dishes for you,
and I can drop by on the way.

67
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,349
Shall I go to your company?

68
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,267
No, I don't need side dishes.

69
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,938
Yeon-u, I'm sorry but I'm a bit busy now,
so I have to go.

70
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,564
Oh, I see.

71
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,692
The thing is, today is Jun-u's birthday,

72
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,361
so that's why I'm coming to Seoul.

73
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,781
Okay, then. Call me later.

74
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,121
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

75
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:55,790
Here.

76
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,835
How did you guys know?

77
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,462
-Blow them out.
-Many happy returns.

78
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,464
-Happy birthday.
-Congratulations.

79
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:05,842
All right, then.

80
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,010
Come on in!

81
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,989
Yeon-u, can we meet?

82
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,596
Look at this right here.

83
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,055
Like this.

84
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,434
Hello.

85
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,895
Is Mr. Lee Jeong-min here?

86
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,188
That's me.

87
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,190
Mr. Oh sent me here.

88
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,983
-Are you Choe Jun-u?
-Yes.

89
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,359
It's nice to meet you.

90
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,821
-Didn't it take so long to get here?
-No, it was okay.

91
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,114
Come on in.

92
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,139
Have you ever properly
learned to draw before?

93
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,391
No.

94
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,062
I just attended a small art academy
when I was little.

95
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,690
You're really talented,
just like Han-gyeol said.

96
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,610
Did you always like to draw?

97
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,362
Yes.

98
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,823
Since I was little,
I've always found doodling

99
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,951
very comforting.

100
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,537
I think it makes me happy.

101
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:01,123
Nice, that's what I call talent.

102
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,460
But preparing a portfolio
for college admission is not easy.

103
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,381
Since you're starting late,
you'll have to work even harder.

104
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,633
-No problem.
-Then shall we begin today?

105
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:11,717
Sure.

106
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:19,809
Jun-u.

107
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,437
This part should be like this.

108
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,571
Yeon-u.

109
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,032
About Soo-bin and Jun-u...

110
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,451
You knew, didn't you?

111
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,125
Can I ask a big favor of you?

112
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,795
What is it?

113
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,882
Could you...

114
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,887
transfer Jun-u to a school
in the city where you live?

115
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,601
Sorry?

116
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:05,187
I don't think those two should be
left together in Seoul now.

117
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,275
I considered moving Soo-bin
to a different school,

118
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,694
but I can't do that because of my work.

119
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:16,824
Wouldn't it be better for Jun-u
to live with you?

120
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:20,786
Yeon-u, I know

121
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,581
how selfish I must sound right now.
I'm fully aware of it.

122
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,207
I'm really sorry. But when it comes

123
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,628
to things that concern my child,
I can't be more understanding.

124
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,379
I'm such a coward, aren't I?

125
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,261
I'm sorry.

126
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:41,599
But you see... Yeon-u, Soo-bin is...

127
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:46,145
I'm suggesting this because I think
she really likes Jun-u.

128
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,689
I think she likes him a lot.

129
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:53,194
Girls at that age can fall
for someone very hard, you know.

130
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,863
Even if you try to stop yourself,

131
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,240
you can't really control
your feelings at that age.

132
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:02,161
I know that Jun-u is a great guy

133
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,747
because he takes after you.

134
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,249
He's very kind. I know that.

135
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,336
But as you know,

136
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,923
they should focus on studying
more than anything at the moment.

137
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,801
I'm sure you also want him

138
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:19,512
to focus more on studying now.

139
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,351
Yeon-u,

140
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,813
let's split them up for the time being.

141
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,981
Okay?

142
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:35,069
We moms should put our feet down.
What else can we do?

143
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,657
Yeon-u, I'm really...

144
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,827
I'm really sorry.

145
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,329
I'm so sorry,

146
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,623
but I beg you.

147
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:49,625
Please?

148
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,461
I'm begging you. Please do it for me.

149
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:05,057
Did you meet with Jun-u separately
by any chance?

150
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,567
You didn't say anything

151
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,445
that might have hurt his feelings,
did you?

152
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,172
Song-hui.

153
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,717
You're not the only mom in the world.

154
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,427
I'm a mom too.

155
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,638
I'm not as competent as you are,

156
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,682
but I am a mother too.

157
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:48,809
I, too,

158
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,813
can do anything for my child.

159
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,816
Nothing scares me if it's for my son.

160
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,943
But you know what?

161
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,196
I respect Jun-u's feelings.

162
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,199
To me,

163
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,286
his emotions are more important
than anything else

164
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,621
in the world.

165
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:15,419
Song-hui, listen.
I do not want to disrespect...

166
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,798
or trample on his feelings.

167
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,357
Soo-bin's mom hasn't found out
that you two are dating, right?

168
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,401
No.

169
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:45,783
Mr. Lee.

170
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,413
-Mr. Lee.
-Yes.

171
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,374
Well...

172
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,544
I have to go to my part-time job.

173
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:57,962
All right, Jun-u.

174
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,839
But are you sure you can juggle this
with your part-time job?

175
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,425
Of course. I can do it.

176
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,678
I'll tidy up for you, so get going.

177
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,347
Thank you. Bye.

-Hey, Jun-u!
-Mr. Oh.

181
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,924
I had my first class at the academy
you put me in touch with.

00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,509
I see. How was it?

183
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,845
-Did you do well?
-Yes.

184
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,013
I'm glad to hear that.

185
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:53,267
Jun-u, that instructor is
very good at what he does.

186
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,311
So just follow his instructions

187
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,313
and do your best.

188
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,148
Don't worry about anything.

189
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,858
Okay, I'll do my best.

190
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,904
Oh, and I really wanted to thank you.

191
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,156
I'm hugely...

192
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,411
What? Go on.

193
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,997
I'm hugely indebted to you.

194
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,880
Oh, okay. My goodness.

195
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,717
Don't be silly.

196
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,428
-Are you going to work now?
-Yes.

197
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,139
All right. Work hard.

198
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:36,018
And try to get some studying done
whenever you have a chance.

199
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,104
Okay.

200
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:51,742
LETTER OF APOLOGY
CHOE JUN-U

201
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:56,038
So this is... It's a case of forced...

202
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,289
A forced transfer, sir.

203
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,666
Lower your voice.

204
00:15:58,749 --> 00:15:59,750
You're...

205
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,920
I'm surprised.

206
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:06,131
You have a talent. You did
a great job of drawing this ladybug.

207
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,938
I'm sorry I'm late.

208
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,370
SELF-MADE CEO BRIBES HIS SON'S TEACHER

209
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,079
CHOE JUN-U

210
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,768
Happy birthday, Jun-u.

211
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,772
No one's birthday has ever felt

212
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,148
this important to me.

213
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,900
-Let me do it.
-Hurry up.

214
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,694
-Give it to me. No, wait!
-I'm done.

215
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,321
-Where? It looks fine.
-Gosh.

216
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,239
-Let's just wrap it like this.
-It's not ripped.

217
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,492
I always thought it was such a cliché

218
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,869
to thank someone
for being born into this world,

219
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,829
but you taught me
that one could truly mean it.

220
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,458
Jun-u, thank you for being born
into this world.

221
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:08,003
You're the most precious person to me.

222
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,423
You've finally found your path,
so I prepared this for you.

223
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,884
But the thing is,
I know nothing about art.

224
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,887
I'm not sure if this is right.

225
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,890
I hope you like the gift
even if I got it wrong.

226
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,517
To Choe Jun-u.

227
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,310
From Soo-bin.

228
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,270
It can never be wrong

229
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,022
if it's from you.

230
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:33,946
Jun-u.

231
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,782
Jun-u.

232
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,408
Mom?

233
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,160
Thanks for the food.

234
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,000
-Is it good?
-Yes.

235
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,171
But you shouldn't eat
right before you go to bed.

236
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,175
I skipped dinner, so I was hungry anyway.

237
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,887
Today is a very special day.

238
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,848
It's your birthday,

239
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,933
and it was your first day
at the art academy.

240
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,353
Actually, Mr. Oh was a big help.

241
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,481
He found an academy for me

242
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,484
and put in a word for me
so I wouldn't be burdened.

243
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,780
I know. We owe him a lot.
How should we repay him?

244
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,407
I'll have to work harder.

245
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,164
Mom.

246
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,209
After all,

247
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,796
I met many good people at this school.

248
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,009
Mr. Oh...

249
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:38,802
and...

250
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,144
You also met Soo-bin?

251
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,486
Well...

252
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:03,076
You didn't say anything that might
have hurt his feelings, did you?

253
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,125
My mom still thinks that the time
she spent with her first love

254
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,462
years ago was the most
beautiful moment in her life.

255
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,840
Back when she was 18.
She still misses that moment.

256
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,844
You have something to tell me, don't you?

257
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,930
No, I don't.

258
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,852
Are you sure? I think you do.

259
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,440
Jun-u.

260
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,819
You've grown up to be
such a kind, thoughtful boy.

261
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,739
Thank you for being my son.

262
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,163
Eat up.

263
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,414
Okay.

264
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,570
I wonder if he liked my present.

265
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,657
I miss him.

266
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,923
It's pretty hard, right?

267
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,562
But preparing a portfolio
for college admission is not easy.

268
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,024
Since you're starting late,
you'll have to work even harder.

269
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:44,946
Jun-u.

270
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,875
Have you gotten over him yet?

271
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,503
Yes, I feel a lot better now.

272
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,049
I'm completely over him now.

273
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,133
What about you?

274
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,384
Me too.

275
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,596
I feel a lot better too.

276
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,140
Da-huin.

277
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:13,767
Hi, O-je.

278
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,894
-Hi.
-Hi.

279
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:16,978
Hi.

280
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,940
We're best friends now.

281
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:25,862
Shall we go in?

282
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:26,822
Sure.

283
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,574
Let's go, besties.

284
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,160
-Let's go.
-Gosh.

285
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,204
Are you feeling better now?

286
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,288
Stop it.

287
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,925
Thank you for your present.

288
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,971
I was very, very

289
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:52,722
touched.

290
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,102
Also, I went to the academy yesterday.

291
00:23:58,186 --> 00:23:59,104
Really?

292
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,856
How was it?

293
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,277
It was nice.

294
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:11,199
The room was full of kids
drawing something.

295
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,285
It made my heart flutter.

296
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,707
The teacher is very competent too.

297
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,710
I think I'll learn a lot from him.

298
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:23,753
That's great.

299
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,173
That's really awesome.

300
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:31,845
But I guess you'll be more tired
from now on.

301
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:35,182
With the academy and your part-time job.
Can you pull them both off?

302
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,392
Isn't the academy a bit far away?

303
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,356
I have to. I can do it.

304
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:45,817
I'm Choe Jun-u.

305
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,903
I'm the best.

306
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,578
I went to a new academy yesterday too.

307
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,748
-Really?
-Yes.

308
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,126
I told my mom everything.

309
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,629
I told her that I went
to celebrate your birthday.

310
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,466
Was it okay?

311
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:14,095
Yes. I promised her I'd work harder.

312
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,932
Luckily, she seems to be
feeling a bit better.

313
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,685
I even went to take a level test
at an academy she found.

314
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:24,606
Good job.

315
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,359
You too.

316
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,779
-Good job.
-Good job.

317
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:52,717
Mr. Oh.

318
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:55,845
Jun-u.

319
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,181
Can we talk for a moment?

320
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,725
Sure.

321
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:04,646
Jun-u.

322
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,482
Listen carefully to what I say.

323
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,028
The Office of Education will inspect
our school soon

324
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,488
regarding Hwi-yeong.

325
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,616
They'll investigate the grade tampering

326
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:21,037
and the incidents you were involved in.

327
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,210
It'll probably dig up some bad memories,

328
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,754
and I feel bad about it.

329
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,716
But we still need to put things right

330
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,551
and prove your innocence.

331
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:40,640
That's the thing I felt most guilty about.

332
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:46,563
I see.

333
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:51,985
It's Hwi-yeong.

334
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,404
Will he be kicked out?

335
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,396
Leave it.

336
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:32,901
I said, leave it.

337
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,320
I'm just cleaning up the mess.

338
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,739
I'm not doing it for you.

339
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,115
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

340
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:21,783
I have to run.

341
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,078
-I'm leaving.
-See you.

342
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:28,665
Let's go home.

343
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,847
I'm sorry I'm late. Sorry.

344
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:51,312
CHOE JUN-U

345
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,700
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm late.

346
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,814
PASSION SNACK RESTAURANT

347
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,233
-Isn't it really good?
-Yes.

348
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,902
I made it.

349
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,823
It seemed like you were skipping
your meals.

350
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,869
This is our signature dish, fried squid.

351
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,038
-Try it. It's good.
-It looks yummy.

352
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,666
Dip it in the tteokbokki sauce,
and take a big bite.

353
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:57,003
I'm so lucky to eat this,
thanks to school ending early.

354
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:07,806
You should eat more.

355
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,600
Eat some rice balls,
fries, and sundae too.

356
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,143
Eat everything, okay?

357
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,232
-I better finish up and go.
-Okay.

358
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:33,414
I'm sorry I'm late. I'm sorry.

359
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,416
Hey, you're early.

360
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:36,918
Mr. Oh.

361
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:40,338
Didn't you ask me to fill in
for you today?

362
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:43,716
Saying you'd be a bit late today.

363
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,260
You came early.

364
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,015
How about working somewhere
near your art academy?

365
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:54,602
The owner asked me to work here
until the end of this month.

366
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:55,812
Oh, I see.

367
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,359
Mr. Oh.

368
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:03,903
Thank you very much

369
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,155
for today.

370
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,241
And I'm sorry.

371
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,202
Come on. You're embarrassing me.

372
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:15,206
If there's anything else
you're having trouble with,

373
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,624
you can keep asking for help.

374
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,334
Okay.

375
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,065
Soo-bin,

376
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,360
I'm having a really tough day.

377
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,532
Still, coming here made me feel better.

378
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,539
You must be asleep already.

379
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:58,750
Good night.

380
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,299
I'm not sleeping yet.

381
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:10,887
How did you know?

382
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,722
I don't know.

383
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,224
I guess we just clicked again.

384
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,652
You must be exhausted.

385
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,447
No, I'm not. I'm full of energy.

386
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,783
Why did you come here then?

387
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,870
Well, just...

388
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:40,083
I was bored at home,
so I wanted to get some fresh air.

389
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:41,584
Since the weather is nice and all.

390
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:47,924
Hey, you're bleeding!

391
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:14,117
Were you upset?
Because you couldn't see me around?

392
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:19,497
Oh, I have something for you.

393
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,457
This is a book on writing cover letters.

394
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:25,253
This is a book that gives helpful tips
about writing cover letters.

395
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:28,214
This is a book that teaches you
the key points of English tests.

396
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:32,343
And this is the perfect workbook
for learning common knowledge.

397
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,178
And this

398
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:37,390
teaches you the secrets of
nailing interviews. There you go.

399
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,184
Why are you giving me these?

400
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,602
I'll be going then.

401
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:44,689
Mr. Oh. Why are you doing this?

402
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,988
To tell you the truth,
I was planning on waiting

403
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:54,032
until you open up your heart to me,

404
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,200
but I thought about it carefully,
and that seemed wrong.

405
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:59,537
I came to the conclusion
that I should help you while waiting.

406
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,582
I also started an internet forum
about English studies.

407
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:05,168
I'll send you some material every day,
so you can study them.

408
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,378
I'll even give you some homework
from time to time.

409
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,297
I'll provide feedback as well.

410
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,842
You know that I'm a teacher, right?
Teacher Oh.

411
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,802
I'll go now since you're working.

412
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,429
-Mr. Oh.
-Yes?

413
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:18,431
But this makes me

414
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,267
feel uncomfortable.

415
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,269
No, don't feel pressured.

416
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:27,190
Shouldn't I do this at least
as someone who likes you?

417
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:28,733
Don't you think?

418
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,152
Ji-min, whether you see me or not,

419
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,404
that's up to you to decide.

420
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:39,786
Okay.

421
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:42,914
Okay, goodbye.

422
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,552
I know what you were thinking.

423
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,891
"Even with his nose plugged
like that, he looks handsome."

424
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,310
No, I wasn't.

425
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:13,111
Well, if you're okay now,
you should take that out.

426
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:22,954
It's tough, isn't it?

427
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,415
No.

428
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,794
Don't say no.

429
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,692
This feels nice.

430
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,111
It's comfortable.

431
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,925
Why aren't you saying anything?

432
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,220
What is there to say?

433
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,306
What's important is being with you.

434
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,610
Am I doing a good job?

435
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:43,784
I'm proud of you.

436
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,329
I'm very proud of you, Choe Jun-u.

437
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,207
I know it's tough for you now,

438
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,920
but as time passes, don't you think
things will become better?

439
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,133
I guess so.

440
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,344
Things will become better, right?

441
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:05,890
Well, that's what grown-ups told me.

442
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,642
That things would become better.

443
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,061
I don't know either.

444
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,689
But when you're having a tough time,

445
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,900
just think of happy thoughts.

446
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,903
Like making it into the art school
that you want,

447
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:20,988
and doing something you dreamed of.

448
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,952
And being beside you.

449
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,335
I'm happy now too.

450
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:39,882
Me too.

451
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,727
Next, Hwi-yeong.

452
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,448
Next, Jun-u.

453
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:06,158
Yes, sir.

454
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,748
What? You're 36th?

455
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,839
Does that mean Sang-hun
got the highest mark?

456
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,966
Soo-bin.

457
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,557
Hwi-yeong. You're okay, right?

458
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:31,892
Check your grades, guys.

459
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,979
If you have any questions,
ask the teacher in charge.

460
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,064
-Okay?
-Okay.

461
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:47,908
Pil-sang, I can't believe
you made it into the top 200.

462
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,827
-Hey, stop it.
-Girls, isn't he so cool?

463
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,203
Seriously, cut it out.

464
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,831
My god, someone's going to the movies.

465
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,708
Ro-mi, I really came in 200th.

466
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:58,085
-What? Oh, my.
-Look at you, Pil-sang.

467
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,380
I thought it was 500 at first,
but it's 200.

468
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:02,840
Go away, Pil-sang.

469
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:03,966
What?

470
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,677
It's your fault. It's all your fault!

471
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:11,432
Pil-sang, I'm impressed
that you came in 200th.

472
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,809
Mr. Oh, Ro-mi and I will go
to the movies together.

473
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,227
-Seriously?
-Yes.

474
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,606
Ro-mi, you can do better next time.

475
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:19,982
After the summer break.

476
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,901
There's no next time.

477
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:26,614
Guys, look at the sky.

478
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,450
The sky is flawlessly blue,

479
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,036
and you guys are 18-year-olds
with a bright future.

480
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,956
You have so many opportunities
ahead of you. Keep it up.

481
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,958
-Congratulations, Pil-sang.
-Thank you.

482
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,878
-Ro-mi, let's--
-No.

483
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,758
-Gosh.
-Ro-mi. Wait, Ro-mi!

484
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:49,637
My, he's so cool.

485
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,639
Enough, okay?

486
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,057
He is so cool, though.

487
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,517
Did you do well, Da-huin?

488
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,477
Yes. I did so much better
this time, right?

489
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,980
So studying hard does pay off, you know?

490
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,442
I was so surprised.

491
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:06,862
Jun-u.

492
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,575
I did much better this time.

493
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,369
You did too, right?

494
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:14,912
Yes, a little.

495
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,708
Hey, your grades jumped so much.

496
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:22,628
This is amazing. Congratulations.

497
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:24,547
Oh, right.

498
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,591
We shouldn't have met up like that
last night.

499
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,594
I forgot about that for a moment.

500
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:36,851
It's okay. We should let ourselves
breathe a little when we can.

501
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,269
"When we can"?

502
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,813
When we're at school, at least.

503
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,206
What is it?

504
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,083
Mr. Oh suggested that I do this.

505
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:02,960
I took a quick look at it.

506
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:09,216
If I win an award in this contest,

507
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:12,011
I can do early application
under the special talent category.

508
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,056
You're right.

509
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:19,560
Hey, I'm so excited right now.
I think you'll do great.

510
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:26,150
I'm going to try really hard
since I'm getting a late start.

511
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:33,574
I want to find my path soon too.

512
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,242
I'm still so lost.

513
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,289
Everything will go well.

514
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,292
I know you'll find your path very soon.

515
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,550
Everything will be fine.

516
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,802
You'll be fine, Soo-bin.

517
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,930
What's this? A magic spell?

518
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,350
My gosh, Sang-hun.
You finally got the highest mark.

519
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:01,519
-I should learn from you...
-Stop flattering me.

520
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:04,146
-You finally got what you deserved.
-Seriously.

521
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,439
Don't you agree, Hwi-yeong?

522
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,780
Guys, let's go study.

523
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,324
Go back inside. Go on.

524
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:22,581
It turned out that it was my dad.
The person who e-mailed you

525
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,208
and reported the case.

526
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,669
I am sorry

527
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:30,422
that this happened.
I never intended this to happen.

528
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:32,716
Are you all right?

529
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,553
Just worry about yourself.

530
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:39,473
Right, I should. You never let me down.

531
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,184
This is the Ma Hwi-yeong I know.
I'm relieved now.

532
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,853
I have to say, you have a mind of steel.

533
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,855
I really should learn that from you.

534
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,859
I apologize for what my parents did

535
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,445
to you and your father.

536
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:59,243
But you and your family
have gotten enough out of this.

537
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:01,912
So can't we call it even now?

538
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,377
I'm impressed

539
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,170
by how shameless you still are.

540
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,880
Gosh, you and that ego of yours.

541
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,758
You're really something.

542
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,093
But you know what?

543
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:18,679
I'm bored now.

544
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:21,223
Studying is only fun

545
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,684
when I have you

546
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,562
competing fiercely against me as my rival.

547
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,608
Who am I going to compete with
from now on?

548
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:37,489
All right. Our government's
export-driven policy...

549
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,408
-What's going on?
-Be quiet.

550
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,868
Who are those people?

551
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:43,078
They look like some high-ranking officers.

552
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,163
Hey.

553
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,165
-Pil-sang.
-Yes?

554
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:47,499
I told you to be quiet.

555
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,668
Ro-mi and I are going to the movies.

556
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,545
Okay, sure. Stand straight, guys.

557
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,005
In a fairly short amount of time,

558
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:55,007
the focus shifted from light manufacturing

559
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:58,969
to heavy, chemical,
and high-tech manufacturing.

560
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,012
In this process,

561
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:02,431
industrial facilities were mainly
built in the metropolitan area

562
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:05,017
and the Yeongnam region.
Both had a lot of growth potential.

563
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,560
"It pours out,

564
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,521
collides against the rocks,
and fights fiercely."

565
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:10,689
In this passage...

566
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,117
Hello.

567
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:23,994
We're from the Office of Education.

568
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,788
Oh, welcome.

569
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:28,248
-Hello.
-May we get started?

570
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:30,584
Yes, sure.

571
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:38,342
Mr. Oh.

572
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:40,844
-Yes.
-We'll begin the investigation

573
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,638
on the allegation that Ma Hwi-yeong

574
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:44,890
had his grades tampered,
based on the statement made by

575
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:46,725
his former homeroom teacher,
Mr. Kim Byeong-cheol.

576
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:50,437
We'll also look into whether
any school violence took place

577
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,731
and how it was dealt with if it did.

578
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:56,110
In connection with the same student,
Ma Hwi-yeong.

579
00:44:57,611 --> 00:45:01,115
We'll need to interview a few students
during our investigation.

580
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:04,034
The accused, Ma Hwi-yeong and Lee Gi-tae.

581
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,912
And lastly, another student
of yours, Choe Jun-u.

582
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:09,832
Sure.

583
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:14,795
I'll answer all questions truthfully,
to the best of my knowledge.

584
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:17,965
The thing is though,

585
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,342
Hwi-yeong,

586
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:23,804
as well as all other students,
are still very young.

587
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:28,559
Please keep that in mind
and try to be considerate of them.

588
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:29,977
Please.

589
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,230
Could it have something to do
with those people?

590
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:35,566
What's going on, So-ye?
Is there anything you know?

591
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:37,901
Did they summon Gi-tae too?

592
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:43,365
It's true that Hwi-yeong
asked me to do it,

593
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:47,578
but paying them was my idea.

594
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,456
They did ask for the money,

595
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:53,709
but I wanted to impress Hwi-yeong as well.

596
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:04,678
I told them everything. Now, I can
face you without feeling ashamed.

597
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:07,848
And I apologized to Jun-u as well.

598
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,560
That's great, Gi-tae.
You did the right thing.

599
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:16,315
They'll interview me as well
because I'm your homeroom teacher.

600
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:18,484
And I plan to tell them the truth

601
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:21,487
even if that will hurt your feelings.

602
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:25,407
I know. I'm prepared
to deal with the consequences.

603
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:27,784
You should tell them the truth.

604
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:32,456
I believe that this is the best thing
I can do for your sake.

605
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:34,708
Yes.

606
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:42,132
Jun-u, come to the counseling office.

607
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,477
In addition to the allegation
of grade tampering,

608
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:56,730
could we verify a few other things

609
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:00,025
regarding your classmate,
Ma Hwi-yeong, with you?

610
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:02,778
Sure.

611
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:11,119
Are these allegations against him

612
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,121
all true?

613
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,003
Jun-u?

614
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:24,800
Gosh.

615
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:28,720
I really didn't think
Hwi-yeong would ever do such things.

616
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,806
The fact that he rigged his grades
was shocking enough.

617
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,558
I can't believe
he did the other things too.

618
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:33,725
So-ye.

619
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,311
Why didn't you tell us?

620
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:40,440
I wish you had told me everything.

621
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:43,277
I had no idea what Jun-u
was going through.

622
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:45,988
I'm sorry. Back then,

623
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:48,282
I was scared things would get out of hand.

624
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,367
So-ye must have had her reasons.

625
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,707
Soo-bin!

626
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:48,300
Why didn't you tell me all this time

627
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:50,177
what you were going through?

628
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:54,640
Since I knew you'd be hurt.

629
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:56,933
How could I tell you?

630
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,187
Still...

631
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:03,315
How did you deal with it all alone?

632
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,902
Why didn't I find out earlier?

633
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:11,531
Why didn't I even try to find out?

634
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:32,969
Soo-bin.

635
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:38,892
You and Hwi-yeong have been friends
since you were little.

636
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,814
You must have hoped
Hwi-yeong wouldn't be such a person.

637
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:50,696
You don't have to feel sorry.
I understand you.

638
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:53,699
Don't blame yourself.

639
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,078
I'll take care of it

640
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,958
the way I want.

641
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:07,254
Jun-u.

642
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,510
How have you been enduring it all?

643
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:20,726
Somehow.

644
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:23,854
Thanks to you.

645
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:32,863
Jun-u.

646
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:39,619
It'll pass soon. This painful moment.

647
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:42,831
Let's...

648
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,710
endure it together.

649
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,475
Your punishment

650
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:04,394
for the grade tampering
will be decided soon.

651
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,104
I see.

652
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:09,232
Do you admit everything
regarding the incident

653
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:10,776
with Choe Jun-u as well?

654
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:12,652
Yes.

655
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:16,698
I'm sure Jun-u told you everything.

656
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:18,867
He put off answering the question.

657
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:29,044
Jun-u.

658
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,506
I'll give you a ride.

659
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:46,478
I realized...

660
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,314
something earlier.

661
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:54,027
I haven't forgiven Hwi-yeong yet.

662
00:51:57,364 --> 00:52:01,243
Deep down, I still fiercely resent him.

663
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:07,332
You've been holding up well.

664
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:13,046
By the way, why did you
postpone an answer?

665
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,508
You could have let it all out right there.

666
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,845
Were you trying to hold back?

667
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,141
That's why I hate myself even more.

668
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:29,729
I don't know what I'm feeling right now.

669
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:34,609
I hated him so much,

670
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,780
and I still can't forgive him. But...

671
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,537
But for some reason,
I couldn't say anything.

672
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,123
I couldn't understand.

673
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,709
I felt so stupid.

674
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,337
Do you know why?

675
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,549
It's because you're a nice person.

676
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:01,553
You hesitate
because you're afraid to hurt someone

677
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:04,389
with your anger and resentment.

678
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,391
That's who you are.

679
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:13,356
Jun-u.

680
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,568
All you have to do is

681
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:20,363
do what you think is right.

682
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:13,041
Why did you do that?

683
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,754
I have nothing to say.

684
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:22,509
We've been best friends
since we were little.

685
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,719
I can't believe...

686
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:27,722
you did such a thing.

687
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:30,558
I've always been a bad person.

688
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,394
You know what?

689
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:36,189
What hurts me the most is

690
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,526
that even while saying
you're my best friend,

691
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,278
I had no idea until now.

692
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,866
That I just let you

693
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:49,869
turn into this person.

694
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:52,872
I'm sorry, Soo-bin.

695
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,208
I might have...

696
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,628
felt it

697
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:01,423
at some point,

698
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:04,467
although I wasn't sure.

699
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,637
I probably hoped...

700
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:11,683
you weren't such a person.

701
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,564
I might have been scared
to know the truth.

702
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,442
That's what I regret the most.

703
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,069
No.

704
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:25,822
You've been a great friend to me.

705
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:33,455
I have to go.

706
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:54,934
I'm home.

707
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:59,272
Hi. How was the academy?

708
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:00,648
Good.

709
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,610
-I want some water.
-Sure.

710
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:10,533
Soo-bin.

711
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,790
Are the things about Hwi-yeong true?

712
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:19,584
What about the thing with Jun-u?

713
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:38,061
Mom, do you see now?

714
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:40,855
Jun-u is not a bad kid.

715
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:42,941
He's a good one.

716
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:56,246
Mom.

717
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:02,210
As you said, my grades have improved,

718
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:05,130
and I've proven
that I can do well on my own.

719
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:07,465
So can you trust me now?

720
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:09,300
Soo-bin.

721
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:11,803
I trust you.

722
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:18,726
But it's a very important period
for you right now.

723
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:22,272
Also,

724
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:24,524
although you think

725
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:28,194
you can do everything well on your own,

726
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,448
at your age, nothing goes your way.

727
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:35,618
Even you don't know
what you're feeling at that age.

728
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,454
Just trust me for now.

729
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:38,830
No matter what.

730
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:43,960
Don't imagine anything
or make any assumptions.

731
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:49,507
Nothing bad will happen to me.

732
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,135
Jun-u also...

733
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:55,305
improved his grades a lot this time,

734
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,141
and he tried really hard.

735
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:02,187
He's found what he wants to do...

736
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:08,067
and we both tried so hard.

737
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,448
We'll continue to try hard too.

738
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:17,076
I just wanted to say that.

739
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,120
I'll go to my room then.

740
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:42,894
Soo-bin.

741
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:46,439
I came to pick you up today.

742
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,399
You know, you came to see me all the time.

743
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:51,653
Come on, it's okay.

744
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:53,029
Let's go.

745
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,415
You can tell us comfortably.

746
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:06,584
Okay.

747
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:14,926
I won't...

748
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:18,263
make any more statements.

749
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:29,357
Please just investigate things
based on Hwi-yeong's statements.

750
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:38,324
Jun-u.

751
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:47,041
Soo-bin, I...

752
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:54,882
You don't have to tell me.

753
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,553
Whatever decision you made,

754
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:00,763
you are right.

755
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,351
Good job.

756
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:27,749
DROPOUT APPLICATION FORM

757
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:33,087
Hwi-yeong.

758
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:37,175
You want to drop out of school?

759
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:42,930
I want to leave this school
as soon as possible.

760
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:47,977
But this...

761
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:51,439
For now,

762
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:57,278
why don't you take some time
and think about it, okay?

763
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:09,666
I'll drop out.

764
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:13,503
Hwi-yeong.

765
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:16,422
This isn't the right way, okay?

766
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:17,840
I'm sorry, Mr. Oh.

767
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:29,519
Jun-u.

768
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:39,404
You should've told them
everything about me.

769
01:01:40,738 --> 01:01:41,864
Why did you do that?

770
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,955
I don't think I have to explain that
to you.

771
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:57,964
I'm going to drop out of school.

772
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:19,402
Hwi-yeong.

773
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,453
Drop out of school? Who said you can?

774
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:31,622
Why? Does that disappoint you?

775
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:34,292
Because you forgave me
but I'm just running away?

776
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:35,626
Who says I forgave you?

777
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:39,589
Do you think I didn't say anything
because I forgave you?

778
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,968
How could I forgive you
when you don't even regret what you did?

779
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,262
Then what should I do?

780
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:49,182
I'm giving up everything and leaving.

781
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:50,975
This is the best way I can think of.

782
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:53,394
I'm scared and afraid as well.

783
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:56,147
What do I have to do then?

784
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,025
What should I do?

785
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:06,199
Have you ever been genuinely sorry
for what you did to me?

786
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:09,827
From the bottom of your heart.

787
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:19,003
You've never been sorry.

788
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:24,300
The only thing that's important to you
is your pride.

789
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:29,013
Ma Hwi-yeong.

790
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,311
You haven't been forgiven.

791
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:39,440
And yet, you're just running away...

792
01:03:41,734 --> 01:03:43,194
like a coward.

793
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:52,703
Choe Jun-u!

794
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:09,011
I'm sorry.

795
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:37,707
I'm sorry.

796
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:37,558
