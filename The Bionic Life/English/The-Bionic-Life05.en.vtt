01:44.280 --> 01:45.120
what are you looking

01:45.400 --> 01:47.030
I’ve never seen someone use the toilet before.

02:16.520 --> 02:18.000
Does Li Yi have any clues?

02:19.800 --> 02:21.070
Huang Shipeng hasn't made any progress here yet

02:21.720 --> 02:23.160
Is there any progress there?

02:27.280 --> 02:28.960
Conger is on time every day

02:28.960 --> 02:30.840
Follow the same route to and from school

02:32.440 --> 02:33.840
I have been observing her for several days

02:34.000 --> 02:35.360
It's half past five every day

02:35.360 --> 02:36.840
Pass that intersection on time

02:38.240 --> 02:39.400
Although student life

02:39.400 --> 02:40.800
Very regular indeed

02:41.120 --> 02:42.560
But she's too precise

02:42.560 --> 02:44.070
Just like clockwork

02:44.560 --> 02:45.560
just like

02:49.680 --> 02:50.440
Like something

02:56.240 --> 02:58.070
You finally started to doubt her

03:00.400 --> 03:01.400
I'm coming

03:01.560 --> 03:02.400
coming

03:05.160 --> 03:06.000
Ms. Li

03:06.400 --> 03:07.840
Why are you here again?

03:08.120 --> 03:10.520
I want to talk to Cong'er again, is it okay?

03:10.520 --> 03:12.000
Mom, it's okay

03:18.680 --> 03:19.400
Thanks

03:36.680 --> 03:37.960
You can play chess?

03:38.600 --> 03:40.120
I was having sex with myself just now

03:41.560 --> 03:43.400
Let's have a plate then

04:50.680 --> 04:51.360
I lost

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Do you want another plate?

04:53.000 --> 04:53.680
elder sister

04:53.680 --> 04:55.800
You probably didn't come here just to play chess, right?

04:56.480 --> 04:58.000
Why did you lose to me on purpose?

05:04.160 --> 05:05.040
Cong'er

05:06.160 --> 05:08.120
I came here to ask you something

05:08.600 --> 05:10.120
About you getting lost

05:11.360 --> 05:13.600
Do you remember the day you disappeared?

05:18.280 --> 05:20.720
What about what happened after the loss?

05:23.000 --> 05:24.240
When was the will made?

05:24.240 --> 05:25.560
Every time I see that android

05:25.560 --> 05:26.840
I feel hairy all over

05:34.040 --> 05:34.800
Cong'er

05:35.150 --> 05:36.720
If you find it difficult

05:36.720 --> 05:37.360
we can

05:37.360 --> 05:38.400
I do not remember

05:39.800 --> 05:41.720
After returning to my parents

05:41.920 --> 05:43.000
I only dream about it occasionally

05:43.000 --> 05:44.360
some fragmentary fragments

05:45.150 --> 05:47.150
I really can’t remember the specifics.

05:59.040 --> 05:59.720
elder sister

06:01.480 --> 06:02.240
Feel sorry

06:03.720 --> 06:06.240
Your life seems to have always been very regular.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.480
Dad said I should have a sense of time

06:10.920 --> 06:13.560
For example, let’s say you’re after school

06:13.560 --> 06:15.480
Will you occasionally go to a friend’s house to play?

06:15.480 --> 06:18.480
Or participate in some school extracurricular activities

06:18.920 --> 06:21.120
Because I'm in sixth grade now

06:21.160 --> 06:22.280
I'm going to be a junior high school student soon.

06:22.280 --> 06:23.920
There is a lot of homework to do

06:27.360 --> 06:28.040
good

06:29.160 --> 06:30.400
last question

06:31.040 --> 06:32.800
I used to work at your father's place

06:32.800 --> 06:34.040
Uncle Li Yi

06:35.150 --> 06:36.560
have you seen him lately

06:40.360 --> 06:41.120
No

06:53.600 --> 06:55.680
When I was chatting with Cong'er, I discovered that

06:56.240 --> 06:58.150
Her impressions of being lost

06:58.150 --> 06:59.360
Very blurry

06:59.480 --> 07:01.480
She can only remember fragments

07:02.360 --> 07:03.400
android memory

07:03.400 --> 07:04.920
Originally composed of fragmented fragments

07:04.920 --> 07:05.680
consist of

07:06.040 --> 07:07.160
Huang Conger had this reaction

07:07.160 --> 07:08.040
It's also normal

07:08.720 --> 07:09.840
With this memory

07:09.840 --> 07:11.800
On the contrary, it better shapes the cornerstone of her personality.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.480
Let her cherish her current parents

07:13.560 --> 07:15.280
What you said makes sense

07:15.720 --> 07:17.160
But I always feel

07:17.160 --> 07:18.480
We can't just rely on these

07:18.480 --> 07:20.360
I concluded that Huang Conger is an android

07:23.800 --> 07:25.240
Then start from the beginning

07:25.800 --> 07:28.360
From the missing case of Huang Conger

07:38.720 --> 07:39.400
look

07:40.480 --> 07:41.840
The real Huang Conger

07:41.920 --> 07:43.600
was found five years ago

07:43.720 --> 07:44.720
But six years ago

07:44.720 --> 07:46.000
Huang Shipeng started to fake

07:46.000 --> 07:47.360
Her identity information

07:48.480 --> 07:49.480
That is to say

07:49.480 --> 07:50.560
Huang Shipeng in Huang Conger

07:50.560 --> 07:51.800
before being reported

07:51.800 --> 07:53.040
Just know this case

07:54.150 --> 07:55.800
Today you continue to stare at Huang Conger

07:56.120 --> 07:57.040
I'm going to the police station

08:28.760 --> 08:29.480
excuse me

08:29.760 --> 08:31.360
Who is Police Officer He Yonghe?

08:32.360 --> 08:33.440
What do you want from him?

08:34.240 --> 08:35.720
I am bright-eyed Cheng Nuo

08:35.840 --> 08:37.720
I would like to ask Officer He some questions.

08:38.840 --> 08:40.440
Officer He has passed away

08:41.480 --> 08:42.240
died

08:42.240 --> 08:42.880
right

08:42.880 --> 08:44.120
died five years ago

08:44.120 --> 08:44.840
when discovered

08:44.840 --> 08:46.200
It’s already terminal cancer

08:46.360 --> 08:47.960
He continued to work for a while

08:49.480 --> 08:50.520
Then let me ask you

08:50.720 --> 08:51.640
Do you know this person?

08:52.080 --> 08:53.840
Or did Officer He ever mention him to you?

08:55.480 --> 08:56.240
do not know

08:57.360 --> 08:59.240
This man said that Officer He saved his daughter

08:59.240 --> 09:00.480
Contact details are also provided

09:00.600 --> 09:02.240
But later we checked

09:02.240 --> 09:03.200
he is lying

09:03.440 --> 09:04.440
Just don't know

09:04.440 --> 09:05.760
How did he meet Officer He?

09:07.000 --> 09:07.880
unfathomable understanding

09:09.840 --> 09:11.080
Do you have any here?

09:11.080 --> 09:12.760
What about Officer He’s early police record?

09:13.080 --> 09:15.120
This is the application form. Please take a look.

09:16.240 --> 09:18.480
Wait a minute I need to verify

09:19.360 --> 09:20.080
follow me

09:21.480 --> 09:22.240
Thanks for your hard work

09:31.000 --> 09:31.840
Come and put it here

09:32.720 --> 09:34.640
These are all police records filed

09:34.640 --> 09:36.240
Officer He's should be inside.

09:36.320 --> 09:37.080
Trouble

09:37.240 --> 09:38.080
You look first

10:31.480 --> 10:32.240
Cong'er

10:36.720 --> 10:37.600
elder sister

10:38.520 --> 10:40.840
Do you think what is said here is true?

10:41.360 --> 10:43.120
Androids harm society

10:43.320 --> 10:44.600
distorted moral values

10:44.720 --> 10:46.240
Escape from reality

10:47.440 --> 10:48.960
Shouldn't exist at all

10:51.120 --> 10:51.880
Cong'er

10:53.480 --> 10:55.240
This is just the view of some people

10:55.360 --> 10:56.640
What about Uncle Li Yi?

10:57.960 --> 10:59.080
What did he do wrong

10:59.080 --> 11:00.080
You want to catch him

11:01.000 --> 11:02.240
This matter is very complicated

11:02.240 --> 11:03.000
elder sister

11:03.760 --> 11:05.600
Why do you have to be at the school gate every day?

11:05.600 --> 11:06.600
Stare at me

11:16.520 --> 11:17.360
elder sister

11:19.520 --> 11:21.360
Do you really want to arrest me?

11:24.720 --> 11:26.000
give me some time

11:27.480 --> 11:29.520
Can you listen to me and slowly explain it to you?

11:29.520 --> 11:30.720
I am going home

11:31.480 --> 11:33.360
Mom and dad are still waiting for me to eat

11:34.240 --> 11:35.360
Congconger

12:23.840 --> 12:26.080
You didn’t just call me out for a late-night snack, did you?

12:28.720 --> 12:29.360
sit

12:39.120 --> 12:40.720
So Huang Shipeng called the police

12:40.760 --> 12:42.240
Not because I lost my daughter

12:42.240 --> 12:43.440
It's because I picked one up

12:43.440 --> 12:44.720
wandering little girl

12:44.720 --> 12:45.720
this little girl

12:46.240 --> 12:47.320
That's Huang Conger

12:53.320 --> 12:55.000
The day before yesterday when I was following Huang Shipeng

12:55.000 --> 12:55.960
Have seen this man

12:56.720 --> 12:57.840
The money Huang Shipeng withdrew

12:58.440 --> 12:59.360
It's all for him

13:00.600 --> 13:03.200
Huang Shipeng was blackmailed by Cong'er's biological father

13:04.080 --> 13:04.840
Cong'er's household registration

13:04.840 --> 13:06.760
Registered when she was four years old

13:08.520 --> 13:09.720
Said he was biological father

13:12.360 --> 13:13.720
Maybe just her buyer

13:17.000 --> 13:18.200
As long as we don't say

13:19.320 --> 13:21.000
They can still live their own lives

13:23.120 --> 13:24.720
If the truth is revealed

13:25.440 --> 13:26.840
It's like tearing this family apart

13:32.520 --> 13:34.520
you are worried about them

13:41.960 --> 13:43.480
But blackmail is a thing

13:43.840 --> 13:44.720
Appeared once

13:44.720 --> 13:46.360
It will definitely happen a second time

13:46.600 --> 13:47.960
We just have to find out the truth

13:47.960 --> 13:49.840
Only then can we really help Huang Shipeng’s family

13:50.320 --> 13:51.440
Now what

13:51.720 --> 13:53.000
Just this piece of paper

13:53.480 --> 13:54.720
It doesn't constitute evidence at all

13:56.120 --> 13:58.000
Then they must admit this with their own mouths

13:58.000 --> 13:58.960
How can it be

13:59.600 --> 14:01.480
Huang Shipeng has absolutely no need to cooperate with us

14:06.000 --> 14:07.120
we have to help them

14:08.200 --> 14:09.600
Just use the way you used

14:15.320 --> 14:17.120
What are you doing? Why are you here again?

14:17.440 --> 14:18.520
What are you doing?

14:18.880 --> 14:19.480
Cong'er

14:19.840 --> 14:21.640
Shipeng Shipeng stopped them

14:28.480 --> 14:29.320
Cong'er

14:34.240 --> 14:36.080
After injecting you with the medicine

14:36.080 --> 14:37.640
Are you an android?

14:38.320 --> 14:40.120
We'll find out soon

14:40.200 --> 14:41.720
But if you really are

14:41.720 --> 14:43.840
Your parents will be guilty of hiding the androids

14:43.840 --> 14:45.000
and be punished

14:45.080 --> 14:47.120
If you tell us the truth now

14:47.240 --> 14:48.600
It won't bother them

15:02.360 --> 15:03.120
Cong'er

15:03.120 --> 15:03.880
Cong'er

15:06.720 --> 15:07.480
Cong'er

15:17.440 --> 15:18.120
dad

15:19.520 --> 15:20.360
Mother

15:22.080 --> 15:22.960
Cong'er

15:25.600 --> 15:28.000
You are an android and also my daughter

15:28.640 --> 15:30.360
Dad goes to apply to Mingmou

15:31.240 --> 15:33.360
Our family must be together

15:40.480 --> 15:41.880
In order not to be discovered, Cong'er

15:42.200 --> 15:43.720
I searched a lot of information about bionic people.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.000
She has been there for so many years

15:45.000 --> 15:46.480
Haven't left this home yet

15:47.600 --> 15:49.600
You should have given her a lot of security

15:52.720 --> 15:55.480
Why does Cong'er live with you?

16:00.600 --> 16:01.600
six years ago

16:02.320 --> 16:03.360
Why is it you again?

16:03.360 --> 16:04.720
What to eat, eat, go quickly, go quickly

16:04.720 --> 16:05.840
Don't affect my business

16:06.320 --> 16:07.120
Really

16:07.120 --> 16:08.480
If you want to eat, ask your parents to buy it.

16:08.480 --> 16:09.480
Leave quickly

16:09.640 --> 16:10.480
don't affect me

16:11.720 --> 16:12.720
Brother Peng is here

16:12.960 --> 16:13.760
Same old thing

16:14.360 --> 16:15.080
okay

16:15.240 --> 16:16.000
Leave quickly

16:23.840 --> 16:25.080
Children, come and sit

16:27.760 --> 16:28.960
The boss will add another noodle

16:29.480 --> 16:30.360
okay

16:32.000 --> 16:32.720
Sit, sit, sit

16:33.360 --> 16:34.360
No chili for one portion

16:34.360 --> 16:35.120
okay

16:35.480 --> 16:37.080
Here you go, eat slowly

16:37.360 --> 16:38.240
Come, come, come

16:43.360 --> 16:44.080
Eat

16:55.480 --> 16:57.000
Recently

16:57.000 --> 16:58.160
I can always see her

16:58.160 --> 17:00.000
That noodle stall near where I work

17:00.480 --> 17:02.000
Pick up other people's leftovers

17:02.080 --> 17:03.400
See it almost every day

17:03.920 --> 17:04.720
Shipeng

17:07.040 --> 17:08.280
It's this little girl

17:09.480 --> 17:10.800
Have you found her parents?

17:11.000 --> 17:11.720
found it

17:12.160 --> 17:13.480
He said he would be here soon

17:15.920 --> 17:18.200
What's your name, kid?

17:22.200 --> 17:23.069
Oh my God

17:23.640 --> 17:24.480
Shipeng

17:26.680 --> 17:27.440
This hurt

17:27.880 --> 17:29.680
She said she accidentally fell it

17:29.720 --> 17:30.800
Fallen

17:38.400 --> 17:39.440
The landlady is here

17:40.000 --> 17:40.960
I want two noodles today

17:40.960 --> 17:42.000
Okay, Brother Huang

17:45.560 --> 17:46.880
You ran out again by yourself

17:50.960 --> 17:52.000
Where are your parents?

17:54.480 --> 17:56.440
Didn't the police find her parents that day?

17:57.040 --> 17:58.440
This problem has not been solved either.

17:58.680 --> 18:00.000
Take a look at this child

18:00.440 --> 18:01.760
New injuries and old injuries

18:01.800 --> 18:02.720
Meeting his parents today

18:02.720 --> 18:04.200
I have to ask what's going on

18:04.520 --> 18:05.760
Don't be anxious first

18:07.560 --> 18:09.320
Which one is your home, kid?

18:09.320 --> 18:10.000
This way

18:10.200 --> 18:11.040
This one

18:12.000 --> 18:13.280
Is this your home?

18:13.720 --> 18:14.400
That

18:15.000 --> 18:15.960
Oh my God

18:16.440 --> 18:17.080
this

18:18.680 --> 18:20.040
What kind of parents are these?

18:20.240 --> 18:20.960
yes

18:20.960 --> 18:22.320
This is so irresponsible

18:22.440 --> 18:24.400
Auntie, don't knock on the door

18:24.440 --> 18:26.880
Never knock on the door

18:28.240 --> 18:29.400
my parents

18:29.400 --> 18:31.800
Don't let me talk to strangers

18:32.160 --> 18:34.480
Otherwise they will beat me

18:35.800 --> 18:37.480
You go back first

18:37.960 --> 18:40.720
I can go in by myself

18:42.040 --> 18:42.720
this

18:43.480 --> 18:44.960
Okay, okay, let's go

18:45.480 --> 18:48.000
I'll go to the police station another day to report the situation.

18:49.080 --> 18:50.640
That kid

18:50.920 --> 18:52.440
Are you sure this is your home?

18:54.320 --> 18:55.560
That uncle and aunt are gone

18:59.560 --> 19:00.320
That's it

19:01.160 --> 19:01.760
Don't you know

19:01.760 --> 19:03.400
Where does your uncle work?

19:03.400 --> 19:04.720
If you have any difficulties, what can I do?

19:04.720 --> 19:05.720
Just go find your uncle

19:05.720 --> 19:06.480
OK

19:07.520 --> 19:08.240
good

19:08.240 --> 19:08.560
obedient

19:08.560 --> 19:09.800
Then let's go

19:11.160 --> 19:11.960
let's go

19:13.720 --> 19:14.880
Let's go, let's go

19:20.920 --> 19:21.400
You and your wife

19:21.400 --> 19:23.200
Why are you meddling in so many other things?

19:24.480 --> 19:25.480
let me tell you

19:25.520 --> 19:27.440
That kid is an android

19:27.560 --> 19:29.440
Throw it on the street and no one wants it

19:30.480 --> 19:31.960
Even if it’s an android

19:31.960 --> 19:34.400
You can't ignore such a small child.

19:35.080 --> 19:37.080
Otherwise, you should be a good person and take it to the end.

19:37.800 --> 19:38.880
you give me money

19:38.880 --> 19:41.200
I will kindly sell this daughter to you.

19:41.200 --> 19:42.480
What are you talking about?

19:42.480 --> 19:43.280
What police

19:43.920 --> 19:45.240
for a child

19:45.440 --> 19:47.280
Are legal parents important?

19:47.280 --> 19:49.000
What's more important is loving his parents?

19:49.000 --> 19:50.520
Isn't this a thing?

19:52.200 --> 19:53.240
Let me tell you

19:53.680 --> 19:54.920
the most important is

19:55.040 --> 19:57.760
Don’t commit sin if your adopted son is barren

20:12.880 --> 20:14.240
You said they are still okay?

20:14.240 --> 20:15.400
Be a parent?

20:16.280 --> 20:18.000
Just know that you are enjoying yourself

20:18.080 --> 20:20.080
Don't care about the children at all

20:20.800 --> 20:22.640
You also saw the injuries on the child

20:22.640 --> 20:24.280
That must be man-made

20:24.680 --> 20:25.560
Do not be angry

20:27.480 --> 20:28.480
so many years

20:28.680 --> 20:30.640
Neither of us wants a child.

20:31.240 --> 20:32.400
People here have children

20:32.400 --> 20:33.560
Don’t know how to cherish it yet

20:40.240 --> 20:41.080
or

20:42.560 --> 20:43.760
Take her to our home

20:46.720 --> 20:47.720
Pick us up

20:48.720 --> 20:48.960
That

20:50.000 --> 20:51.280
Is it illegal?

20:59.000 --> 21:00.480
Come on, come on, come on, take a look

21:02.480 --> 21:03.400
like or not

21:03.800 --> 21:05.000
This will be your room from now on

21:05.560 --> 21:06.640
As long as you are willing to

21:06.960 --> 21:08.880
Live with us from now on

21:12.320 --> 21:13.440
Sit on and give it a try

21:15.440 --> 21:16.160
How about it

21:17.800 --> 21:18.520
and this

21:38.000 --> 21:39.800
Whether you are an android or not

21:40.480 --> 21:42.240
Dad will love you just as much

21:44.440 --> 21:45.480
We have been a family for a long time

21:47.280 --> 21:48.320
She has it all planned

21:49.080 --> 21:50.280
This is the ticket and luggage

21:50.880 --> 21:53.000
If we hadn't suddenly come over today

21:53.280 --> 21:54.720
she probably

21:55.560 --> 21:56.720
left already

21:57.880 --> 21:58.720
Silly boy

21:59.320 --> 22:02.000
How could mother possibly let you wander again?

22:12.720 --> 22:13.520
Officer Chen

22:13.720 --> 22:14.480
good

22:19.200 --> 22:19.920
Come in

22:27.240 --> 22:28.720
Officer Chen, what do you mean?

22:28.720 --> 22:29.480
stand still

22:29.520 --> 22:31.280
why do you want to come here

22:31.680 --> 22:33.480
I gave you all the money I saved

22:33.960 --> 22:36.320
You promised me you wouldn't show up again

22:36.400 --> 22:38.240
Why do you want to lie?

22:38.280 --> 22:39.200
Cong'er

22:39.960 --> 22:41.240
Conger, what are you talking about?

22:41.720 --> 22:43.000
what on earth did you do

22:43.880 --> 22:44.640
dad

22:44.920 --> 22:46.920
They don't just ask you for money

22:47.480 --> 22:49.000
Still asking me for money

22:51.400 --> 22:52.760
You promise not to tell on me

22:53.000 --> 22:54.440
this is all my money

23:01.200 --> 23:02.640
You scum

23:02.640 --> 23:03.440
What are you doing?

23:04.080 --> 23:05.200
The police are still here

23:08.720 --> 23:09.520
Zhao Meng Chen Ying

23:10.080 --> 23:11.080
Do you know this kid?

23:11.280 --> 23:12.000
what relationship

23:13.240 --> 23:14.720
I'm so stupid after taking drugs that I don't know

23:14.720 --> 23:15.440
say

23:15.440 --> 23:17.280
I bought the android

23:17.400 --> 23:19.480
Don’t you know that smuggling androids is illegal?

23:20.000 --> 23:21.480
My old man said

23:21.480 --> 23:23.720
Whoever has children will give the inheritance to them

23:24.280 --> 23:26.400
Who knew it was so hard to pull a child?

23:26.440 --> 23:27.720
I don't want to care anymore

23:28.080 --> 23:29.160
you all heard it

23:29.640 --> 23:30.720
This pair of scum

23:30.920 --> 23:33.320
Will just throw Cong'er on the street

23:34.000 --> 23:36.240
I won't let Cong'er go with you again.

23:36.520 --> 23:37.400
Will not

23:38.000 --> 23:39.720
Your relationship is now illegal.

23:41.040 --> 23:42.000
You and Huang Conger

23:42.280 --> 23:43.400
separate for a while

23:44.240 --> 23:45.000
Our police will communicate with Mingmou

23:45.000 --> 23:46.640
Let's handle this properly together

23:48.080 --> 23:48.880
Cong'er

24:01.720 --> 24:02.440
Cong'er

24:02.960 --> 24:04.520
You pack your luggage

24:04.520 --> 24:06.200
Let’s take a look back at our bright eyes first.

24:39.800 --> 24:40.520
elder sister

24:40.960 --> 24:42.040
I'll do it myself

24:52.000 --> 24:52.880
elder sister

24:53.520 --> 24:55.640
Can you play a game of chess with me again?

24:58.280 --> 24:59.000
OK

25:14.720 --> 25:15.760
Cong'er

25:16.320 --> 25:18.240
They will be back soon

25:18.760 --> 25:20.320
I will also apply to the headquarters

25:20.320 --> 25:21.880
Let you stay with them

25:22.160 --> 25:23.000
I know

25:24.560 --> 25:26.680
Mom and dad are just not here temporarily

25:28.080 --> 25:29.920
I will stay in Mingmou obediently

25:30.800 --> 25:32.240
Wait until they come out

25:33.280 --> 25:35.000
Let's go home together again

25:36.480 --> 25:38.760
Although this home

25:38.960 --> 25:40.880
It was a lie from the beginning

25:42.800 --> 25:44.560
but it works for me

25:45.080 --> 25:46.640
It's the real home

25:53.040 --> 25:54.000
elder sister

25:54.800 --> 25:56.040
You are a good guy

25:56.760 --> 25:58.640
Uncle Li Yi is also a good person

26:00.080 --> 26:01.880
Can you not arrest him?

26:03.280 --> 26:05.240
do you know where he is

26:05.720 --> 26:07.240
Is he an android?

26:08.720 --> 26:10.760
Is he an android?

26:10.760 --> 26:12.960
We'll have to wait until we find him to be sure.

26:13.520 --> 26:15.040
Did he say anything to you?

26:16.480 --> 26:17.240
No

26:17.960 --> 26:19.960
Uncle always talks very little

26:20.240 --> 26:21.720
Put down the gift and leave

26:22.880 --> 26:24.760
What gift?

26:25.280 --> 26:26.400
That's it

26:53.320 --> 26:54.760
This is what I found that day

26:55.000 --> 26:56.400
Just watch this video

27:00.520 --> 27:02.400
I bought this chess piece that day.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.440
Is there any record of his payment?

27:10.160 --> 27:10.960
There should be

27:10.960 --> 27:12.080
Is it okay if I look for it this way?

27:12.080 --> 27:12.880
Thank you

27:15.800 --> 27:16.520
Tina

27:16.720 --> 27:18.960
This is the latest work progress of our department

27:21.000 --> 27:21.640
correct

27:21.640 --> 27:23.720
Minister doubts previous shantytown raids

27:23.720 --> 27:24.760
Something slipped through the net

27:24.760 --> 27:26.040
You can check again

27:26.960 --> 27:29.520
Mingmo has conducted raids in shantytowns

27:30.960 --> 27:32.000
when

27:32.000 --> 27:32.920
two years ago

27:33.000 --> 27:35.480
At that time, many illegal androids were arrested.

27:37.280 --> 27:39.560
Do you know where I can find relevant information?

27:39.560 --> 27:40.560
Then I'll send it to you

27:40.800 --> 27:41.520
Thanks

28:15.400 --> 28:16.960
that shantytown

28:17.080 --> 28:18.320
I can't find it online

28:18.320 --> 28:20.520
Any information about androids

28:20.680 --> 28:22.240
what happened

28:22.800 --> 28:23.800
specific

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
I'm not so sure either
