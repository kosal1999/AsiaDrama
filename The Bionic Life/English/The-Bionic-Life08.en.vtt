00:33.840 --> 00:34.520
morning

00:36.520 --> 00:37.240
morning

00:40.840 --> 00:42.600
Is there any new progress?

00:46.840 --> 00:49.120
I found this in the lost and found center

00:49.400 --> 00:51.600
He probably lost it when he ran away.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.400
Check departure date

00:54.560 --> 00:55.520
September 5th

00:55.880 --> 00:57.600
The day after Li Yi was killed

00:58.920 --> 01:00.560
I doubt Yin Tianhong’s ultimate goal

01:00.560 --> 01:01.400
Itu Li Yi

01:01.920 --> 01:03.480
if we hadn't met you

01:03.480 --> 01:05.280
Maybe he has escaped from Xiyuan

01:05.680 --> 01:07.920
So this is illegal forgery

01:09.000 --> 01:10.560
You will also need to check with the ferry company.

02:21.600 --> 02:22.680
Strange things

02:22.840 --> 02:25.000
Is this our company's certificate?

02:25.600 --> 02:26.400
but

02:27.280 --> 02:29.400
There is no one named Liang Ren here.

02:30.070 --> 02:31.000
September 5th

02:31.840 --> 02:33.120
September 5th

02:33.400 --> 02:34.560
Destination: Donggang

02:35.840 --> 02:37.360
We suspect there's someone aboard the Desire

02:37.360 --> 02:39.560
Help smuggle the robots to Donggang

02:40.600 --> 02:40.960
this

02:40.960 --> 02:41.960
Has the ship arrived?

02:42.560 --> 02:43.680
I want to meet the captain

02:43.720 --> 02:45.880
Just shipped it a few days ago

02:45.880 --> 02:47.520
The captain also called him.

02:48.360 --> 02:51.000
Xiao Li, please ask Captain Jiang to come to the office.

02:51.840 --> 02:55.280
Lao Chiang, both of them are smart investigators.

02:55.840 --> 02:57.520
Captain, I tell you the truth.

02:58.120 --> 03:00.800
We suspect someone is using your cargo ship for smuggling

03:01.120 --> 03:03.680
No, are you mistaken?

03:05.560 --> 03:06.720
Is this your ship number?

03:07.600 --> 03:08.280
of

03:08.280 --> 03:09.240
Have you met this person?

03:12.080 --> 03:12.960
No

03:14.000 --> 03:15.880
How many times have you gone to sea this year?

03:16.070 --> 03:18.840
This is the tenth time this month, right?

03:19.070 --> 03:21.400
Have you noticed anything unusual during this time?

03:23.560 --> 03:25.360
In fact, in January this year

03:25.360 --> 03:27.000
Something happened in the nearby waters

03:27.400 --> 03:28.560
I don't know what case you want to investigate

03:28.560 --> 03:29.560
Is there any contact?

03:29.800 --> 03:30.600
what do you think

03:31.280 --> 03:33.280
There are unapproved foreign cargo ships

03:33.280 --> 03:34.720
Sailing towards Xiyuan waters

03:34.720 --> 03:36.160
As a result, he was arrested by the beach police

03:36.240 --> 03:37.880
Everyone on the boat wanted to escape

03:38.280 --> 03:40.520
However, the storm at sea that day was very violent.

03:40.520 --> 03:41.800
many people drowned

03:41.880 --> 03:44.840
Later, while examining the body that washed up on the beach,

03:44.840 --> 03:46.280
It turns out they are all robots

03:47.120 --> 03:48.680
This even made the news

03:49.000 --> 03:50.070
I have the impression

03:51.400 --> 03:54.400
You two, can you stop?

03:54.680 --> 03:56.400
Don't worry, we'll keep it a secret

03:56.840 --> 03:57.440
Thanks

03:57.440 --> 03:58.520
Very good, very good

03:58.520 --> 04:00.000
But you better check it out

04:00.080 --> 04:01.080
eager crew

04:01.240 --> 04:02.840
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me

04:02.840 --> 04:04.280
Definitely good

04:08.360 --> 04:10.000
where are we going now

04:10.040 --> 04:10.800
night market

04:11.400 --> 04:12.560
Why go to the night market?

04:12.560 --> 04:13.720
Very close to the pier

04:13.800 --> 04:16.000
Many sailors often go there to eat

04:16.269 --> 04:17.800
I have a friend who does business there

04:18.040 --> 04:19.360
Let's ask him first

04:24.800 --> 04:25.480
Boss

04:28.480 --> 04:29.240
Cheng Nuo

04:29.240 --> 04:30.400
Now, wait a minute

04:30.400 --> 04:31.400
I'm very busy today

04:32.280 --> 04:33.040
there are many people today

04:33.040 --> 04:33.720
there are many people today

04:33.800 --> 04:34.600
sit, sit, sit

04:36.240 --> 04:37.150
He is Sun Yao

04:37.400 --> 04:38.480
my high school classmates

04:38.720 --> 04:40.240
Enter the society after graduation

04:40.400 --> 04:41.360
he is a sailor

04:41.920 --> 04:42.800
sailor

04:43.560 --> 04:44.920
It pops up when I think of it

04:45.280 --> 04:46.720
Initially, the sailors did their job well

04:46.800 --> 04:47.920
I had no choice but to come to the night market to set up a stall.

04:48.600 --> 04:49.840
I don't know how much longer I can hold on.

04:51.400 --> 04:52.720
Sun Yao, what are you doing?

04:52.720 --> 04:53.840
Come, come, come

04:53.920 --> 04:54.360
Come quickly

04:54.360 --> 04:55.150
I am coming

04:56.600 --> 04:58.040
who are you chatting with?

04:58.680 --> 04:59.480
no one no one

04:59.480 --> 05:00.360
home home

05:04.040 --> 05:05.680
this is my boyfriend

05:06.280 --> 05:07.160
colleague

05:08.560 --> 05:09.280
colleague

05:09.480 --> 05:11.120
By the way, this time I want to ask you

05:11.920 --> 05:12.920
Have you met this person?

05:20.240 --> 05:21.480
no effect

05:25.240 --> 05:26.280
What's wrong

05:26.600 --> 05:27.360
there is nothing

05:30.240 --> 05:30.920
correct

05:31.400 --> 05:33.360
Our class will have a party tomorrow

05:33.480 --> 05:34.360
are you going?

05:35.480 --> 05:36.360
Busy with work

05:36.360 --> 05:37.360
No matter how busy you are, you have to go

05:37.360 --> 05:39.000
You haven't attended a class reunion in several years.

05:39.000 --> 05:39.840
I really can't leave

05:41.120 --> 05:41.800
real

05:42.240 --> 05:43.920
No matter what happens tomorrow

05:44.240 --> 05:45.560
you must be there

05:45.800 --> 05:47.600
Something important needs to be announced

05:49.600 --> 05:51.040
The girl next to me is nice

05:52.120 --> 05:53.400
What to eat slowly?

05:55.560 --> 05:56.920
Does this have anything to do with women?

05:59.920 --> 06:01.280
what does he want to announce

06:01.600 --> 06:02.920
It must be related to women

06:04.040 --> 06:06.480
How could he say it himself?

06:06.840 --> 06:08.920
I am a thousand-year-old prodigal who cannot be bound.

06:08.920 --> 06:11.040
Look at the towel around his neck

06:11.040 --> 06:12.680
There are cartoon patterns on it

06:12.720 --> 06:15.280
Are there still stickers on the cups?

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
only

06:17.240 --> 06:19.600
He just lowered his head when replying to the message

06:19.720 --> 06:21.040
Still smiling

06:23.040 --> 06:25.040
You'd better go to the party tomorrow

06:25.280 --> 06:26.560
We rarely have real friends

06:27.720 --> 06:29.800
Eat quickly. I'll take you home after you're done.

06:38.150 --> 06:40.240
I'm not hungry, so I'll go back first.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.800
Who created me?

07:16.040 --> 07:18.000
What was my first obsession?

07:19.480 --> 07:21.840
The period after being raided brightly

07:21.840 --> 07:23.360
In the end what happened

07:25.240 --> 07:26.360
Why

07:26.840 --> 07:28.920
my memory will be in pieces

07:41.840 --> 07:44.120
Cheng Nuo heard that you are now working in Mingmo.

07:44.120 --> 07:46.120
How difficult is it to work there?

07:46.150 --> 07:47.600
The income should be high, right?

07:48.240 --> 07:49.040
It doesn't matter

07:49.040 --> 07:50.720
go! go! go

07:56.240 --> 07:58.480
In what situations would you refuse to be assertive?

07:58.480 --> 07:59.360
your girlfriend

08:00.240 --> 08:01.280
When did it happen

08:01.280 --> 08:02.360
five or six months ago

08:02.800 --> 08:04.800
Think about it, this is my best friend

08:05.000 --> 08:05.720
halo

08:05.720 --> 08:06.400
Cheng Nuo

08:06.480 --> 08:07.240
Too much

08:10.160 --> 08:11.000
let me introduce you to

08:11.000 --> 08:11.800
introduce

08:11.800 --> 08:12.400
Come on, hurry up

08:12.400 --> 08:13.720
let me tell you something

08:20.400 --> 08:22.800
Today is our class reunion

08:24.800 --> 08:26.120
Use this opportunity

08:26.120 --> 08:28.520
I want to share happy things with you

08:28.520 --> 08:30.240
happiness

08:30.520 --> 08:32.720
I have been wandering at sea for five years

08:33.480 --> 08:36.000
I really didn't expect that I would go ashore

08:36.880 --> 08:38.000
never thought about it

08:39.480 --> 08:41.480
i can come up with an idea

08:42.320 --> 08:43.240
how are you today?

08:43.600 --> 08:45.600
we are together too

08:45.600 --> 08:46.880
Day 184

08:49.600 --> 08:51.080
Marry me in one thought

08:52.080 --> 08:55.000
marry him

08:55.000 --> 08:56.640
Promise to marry me in one year

08:56.640 --> 08:59.840
marry him

09:02.960 --> 09:06.240
kiss a

09:15.120 --> 09:15.760
halo

09:15.960 --> 09:17.600
Hello, are you Mr. Cheng Nuo?

09:17.720 --> 09:19.520
I'm the person in charge of Channel Ferry

09:19.600 --> 09:21.360
we found something

09:21.360 --> 09:22.880
Is it convenient for you to come here now?

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Okay, I'll be there in a minute

09:25.120 --> 09:26.240
sorry

09:26.240 --> 09:27.720
I even called you on the weekends

09:28.480 --> 09:29.720
Why are you being polite to me?

09:29.960 --> 09:30.760
thank you for the tea

09:31.120 --> 09:32.640
Then I'll just say it

09:34.200 --> 09:36.120
Kasus Chen Xinhui

09:36.240 --> 09:38.120
Why did you want to come to me?

09:39.360 --> 09:40.720
Why did you suddenly think of asking this?

09:41.080 --> 09:42.000
there is nothing

09:42.600 --> 09:45.240
After working for a while

09:45.480 --> 09:46.880
I seem to suddenly understand

09:46.880 --> 09:49.120
Your initial confusion and feelings are gone

09:50.240 --> 09:51.600
I remember the beginning

09:51.880 --> 09:53.320
I read your article

09:53.320 --> 09:55.120
Child Psychology Paper

09:55.240 --> 09:56.480
It's mentioned in it

09:56.960 --> 09:58.840
How to remind a traumatized child

09:58.840 --> 10:00.120
open your heart again

10:00.360 --> 10:01.240
according to me

10:01.640 --> 10:03.600
You may have several different ideas

10:04.600 --> 10:07.320
what is it? Is your work not going well lately?

10:10.040 --> 10:10.960
No

10:12.240 --> 10:13.120
excuse me

10:22.440 --> 10:25.000
How did we first meet?

10:25.320 --> 10:27.240
I went back to school to give a speech

10:27.480 --> 10:28.840
after the lecture

10:28.840 --> 10:30.240
Come and ask me some questions

10:30.840 --> 10:33.000
So at this time we

10:33.000 --> 10:34.320
Contact established

10:34.480 --> 10:35.480
Do not you remember

10:38.600 --> 10:39.760
You're not a robot, are you?

10:45.120 --> 10:46.240
joke

10:47.600 --> 10:48.600
a bit strange

10:48.840 --> 10:50.600
Cheng Nuo also asked me the same question recently

10:51.080 --> 10:52.320
Ask how we met

10:52.480 --> 10:54.000
Why do I suggest you go to improve your eyesight?

10:54.840 --> 10:55.640
Yes

10:56.240 --> 10:59.120
Why is he asking you these questions?

10:59.600 --> 11:00.600
I don't know either

11:00.880 --> 11:01.840
perhaps

11:02.480 --> 11:04.360
He wants to know more about his partner

11:32.600 --> 11:34.200
this is information

11:34.600 --> 11:36.840
This Xu Miao is the chief pursuer on the ship.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.080
Entry-exit joint inspection of crew life

11:39.080 --> 11:40.960
He is responsible for everything, including finances.

11:42.880 --> 11:45.000
What happened to these two complaints in early July?

11:46.440 --> 11:48.880
Last year, a crew member complained that he was withholding his quarterly bonus.

11:48.880 --> 11:50.120
and food subsidies

11:50.120 --> 11:51.200
But Xu Miao thinks

11:51.200 --> 11:53.240
It was the other party who violated company regulations first.

11:53.360 --> 11:55.200
This is not a reduction, but a penalty.

11:55.240 --> 11:56.840
How do companies ultimately identify them?

11:56.840 --> 11:58.240
The problem lies here

11:58.840 --> 11:59.720
Staff questions

11:59.720 --> 12:01.240
We must check it out

12:01.240 --> 12:03.520
But Xu Miao has a strong sense of self-esteem

12:03.520 --> 12:05.360
He said I didn't trust him and wouldn't let me see his watch.

12:05.360 --> 12:06.600
He even quarreled with me

12:06.640 --> 12:08.200
I was just suspicious

12:08.200 --> 12:09.120
Is this a misuse of public funds?

12:09.120 --> 12:10.360
That's why I'm not allowed to look at my watch.

12:10.840 --> 12:12.200
So what to do in the end?

12:12.200 --> 12:13.600
When it comes to quarter-end accounting,

12:13.600 --> 12:16.080
The numbers are exactly the same.

12:16.080 --> 12:18.000
Xu Miao probably felt that the company was suspicious of him.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.480
I feel a little uncomfortable

12:19.840 --> 12:21.200
He resigned soon after

12:21.200 --> 12:22.880
Yes, that's the problem

12:23.320 --> 12:25.200
I also talked to all the staff

12:25.200 --> 12:27.840
In fact, a similar incident occurred only once last year.

12:28.840 --> 12:30.440
Where does Xu Miao work now?

12:31.200 --> 12:32.480
He no longer goes to sea

12:32.480 --> 12:34.480
maybe you want to take a break

12:35.000 --> 12:37.240
Do you have any influence on this person?

12:38.360 --> 12:39.720
he is a fan

12:40.440 --> 12:42.240
There seemed to be nothing else going on.

12:56.840 --> 12:57.360
halo

12:57.720 --> 12:59.840
Sorry, something just happened

13:00.720 --> 13:02.240
Any new clues?

13:02.520 --> 13:04.480
Lang Ning's former chief of staff Xu Miao is very suspicious.

13:04.840 --> 13:06.720
I suspect he lost money gambling

13:07.200 --> 13:08.360
That's why we embezzled public funds

13:09.120 --> 13:10.600
This hole can be filled later

13:11.120 --> 13:12.960
He was probably smuggled in with him.

13:14.640 --> 13:15.600
I'll send you the address

13:16.360 --> 13:17.360
Let's meet there

13:29.080 --> 13:29.840
How's it going

13:30.640 --> 13:31.360
listen

13:45.120 --> 13:46.000
Who are you looking for?

13:46.120 --> 13:47.200
Is your name Xu Miao?

13:56.120 --> 13:56.840
What's wrong

13:57.320 --> 13:59.480
I heard you can help people leave Xiyuan City

14:00.240 --> 14:01.360
Who do you listen to?

14:01.360 --> 14:02.480
If there's no problem, leave quickly

14:02.480 --> 14:04.360
This is your betting history on sports betting sites

14:05.000 --> 14:07.240
How do you make up for losing so much?

14:08.320 --> 14:09.360
If we go in now, we still have to talk.

14:09.880 --> 14:11.600
If not, see you at the police station

14:13.480 --> 14:14.960
I don't understand what you are talking about

14:16.120 --> 14:17.840
Okay, then don't regret it

14:21.000 --> 14:22.200
There will soon be evidence

14:22.240 --> 14:22.880
Incorrect

14:24.760 --> 14:25.600
Wait a moment

14:29.360 --> 14:30.120
that's right

14:31.000 --> 14:32.360
When I was at the beginning of the year

14:33.240 --> 14:34.480
i lost a lot of money

14:35.360 --> 14:37.760
At first I thought about using the spare money on the boat to make money.

14:38.200 --> 14:39.440
I didn't expect it to end

14:40.440 --> 14:41.360
All discounted

14:41.520 --> 14:43.120
So you take people to smuggle

14:43.880 --> 14:45.520
What do you want to know?

14:48.120 --> 14:48.960
do you know

14:56.360 --> 14:57.440
i know this person

14:58.120 --> 14:59.760
I was waiting for him at the dock that day

14:59.760 --> 15:01.240
He didn't show up in the end

15:01.520 --> 15:03.840
The order was finally empty.

15:05.440 --> 15:07.480
Where do you find these customers?

15:08.240 --> 15:09.600
Clients and Perjury

15:10.480 --> 15:11.720
This is all provided by Brother Biao

15:12.240 --> 15:14.720
Then didn't he follow Brother Biao's path?

15:17.760 --> 15:19.600
Brother Biao is the biggest black fish

15:19.960 --> 15:22.000
Smuggling channels throughout Taiyuan

15:22.000 --> 15:23.480
Everything is in Brother Biao's hands

15:23.760 --> 15:24.760
Others also want to do it

15:25.520 --> 15:27.000
You must also have courage.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.360
The smuggling route that my partner and I developed ourselves

15:29.520 --> 15:31.200
This also requires Brother Biao’s approval.

15:31.480 --> 15:32.440
working normally

15:32.440 --> 15:33.240
Mitra

15:33.760 --> 15:34.840
You have accomplices

15:39.480 --> 15:41.480
He was the first to suggest smuggling.

15:41.960 --> 15:43.640
He is also the one who contacted Brother Biao

15:43.880 --> 15:45.840
I'm responsible for getting people on board.

15:45.840 --> 15:47.120
Is he also a cast member?

15:47.240 --> 15:48.480
He is my former colleague

15:48.480 --> 15:49.360
What's his name

15:51.000 --> 15:53.480
If I tell you, will the sin be lessened?

15:53.480 --> 15:54.600
Do you want to say it or not?

15:56.320 --> 15:57.200
he is

16:00.720 --> 16:01.600
Sun Yao

16:06.640 --> 16:07.600
Could you repeat that

16:09.880 --> 16:10.720
Sun Yao

16:11.640 --> 16:12.520
What is he doing

16:14.000 --> 16:17.360
He recently opened a stall at the Fukou Night Market.

16:32.360 --> 16:33.720
I want to talk to Sun Yao alone

16:34.960 --> 16:36.480
Although he is a bit impetuous

16:37.120 --> 16:39.000
But I still understand the big picture.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.200
it's not supposed to do anything like that

16:46.240 --> 16:47.240
Then I'll leave first

16:58.960 --> 17:00.240
An Qiu, let’s go first

17:00.800 --> 17:01.720
until tomorrow

17:11.720 --> 17:12.240
morning

17:12.400 --> 17:14.280
How did we first meet?

17:14.280 --> 17:16.040
Cheng Nuo also asked me the same question recently

18:51.000 --> 18:52.280
he drank too much

18:53.240 --> 18:54.040
Cheng Nuo

18:54.800 --> 18:55.880
Why did you come?

18:55.880 --> 18:56.920
too late

18:57.080 --> 18:58.480
I drank three bottles later.

18:58.560 --> 19:00.520
let me give you new chopsticks

19:02.880 --> 19:03.560
sit here

19:04.400 --> 19:05.280
let's talk

19:07.680 --> 19:09.000
It's okay, keep going, keep going

19:09.000 --> 19:09.720
Coming soon

19:09.720 --> 19:10.960
Come here quickly

19:15.720 --> 19:17.680
Why are you so serious?

19:20.280 --> 19:21.680
I found someone today

19:22.640 --> 19:23.640
Namanya Xu Miao

19:26.400 --> 19:27.440
You know him, right?

19:28.160 --> 19:30.000
I know my former colleagues

19:30.080 --> 19:32.200
We will no longer contact you after this.

19:32.200 --> 19:33.200
What's wrong

19:33.280 --> 19:35.680
Xu Miao took advantage of his position to lead people to smuggle

19:37.000 --> 19:38.280
He also provided a person

19:39.720 --> 19:40.480
that is you

19:46.000 --> 19:48.320
How could he talk nonsense?

19:48.320 --> 19:49.480
Xu Miao also said

19:49.720 --> 19:51.320
You initiated all the smuggling.

19:51.760 --> 19:53.160
Customers are also arranged by you

19:54.680 --> 19:56.080
Impossible Cheng Nuo

19:56.080 --> 19:57.880
So, you haven’t done what I said.

19:59.520 --> 20:00.720
No

20:05.280 --> 20:06.800
Coming for both of you

20:07.280 --> 20:08.800
Thank you for giving it to me.

20:12.240 --> 20:14.000
This person was originally going to board Xu Miao's ship

20:14.000 --> 20:15.200
Leaving Saiyuan

20:15.480 --> 20:17.720
I suspect he had something to do with my mother's death

20:17.960 --> 20:19.040
you really don't know

20:21.320 --> 20:22.680
Why smuggling?

20:25.960 --> 20:27.000
I need money

20:28.000 --> 20:29.520
You know, I'm getting married soon

20:29.640 --> 20:31.880
I want to give him a good home

20:33.200 --> 20:34.440
I do this business

20:35.640 --> 20:37.200
You can't make money

20:37.920 --> 20:39.560
What if I have children in the future?

20:40.800 --> 20:42.000
How can I support this family?

20:42.000 --> 20:42.920
You are the first person to say this

20:42.920 --> 20:44.480
Our own sailors have to be out there all year round.

20:44.480 --> 20:45.520
that's why i do it

20:45.520 --> 20:47.040
Now I feel like my income is not enough.

20:47.160 --> 20:49.000
Are they forcing you to buy a house or asking for an engagement gift?

20:49.000 --> 20:50.880
Besides, why didn't you tell me you had no money?

20:50.880 --> 20:51.880
don't tell other students

20:51.880 --> 20:53.040
I don't want to owe you anything

20:59.800 --> 21:00.960
tell me about this person

21:02.000 --> 21:03.240
I don't know how to find my customers

21:03.240 --> 21:04.520
Who is he?

21:05.000 --> 21:06.760
Does anyone know why we left Sai Yuan?

21:07.480 --> 21:08.960
Only Brother Biao knows

21:10.800 --> 21:12.280
He gave a false identity

21:12.560 --> 21:14.000
he is a wanted criminal

21:14.800 --> 21:16.160
Be careful

21:17.400 --> 21:19.440
But I've never seen it with my own eyes

21:25.080 --> 21:25.800
Cheng Nuo

21:26.720 --> 21:28.240
You won't give up on me just like that, will you?

21:37.440 --> 21:38.520
Don't you plan to get married?

21:46.400 --> 21:47.240
Thanks

21:48.280 --> 21:49.480
Does your fiancé know?

21:49.480 --> 21:50.760
i never told him

21:51.160 --> 21:52.720
Don't do similar things again in the future

21:53.160 --> 21:54.760
This is very irresponsible behavior on his part

21:55.520 --> 21:56.760
You said it yourself

21:56.800 --> 21:58.000
Finally have a home

21:58.320 --> 22:00.000
What would he do if you went to jail?

22:01.080 --> 22:02.720
Appreciating the talent in front of you is the most important thing

22:29.240 --> 22:30.760
How is your friend?

22:35.280 --> 22:36.280
It's none of his business

22:37.760 --> 22:39.080
What we're looking for is the smuggler leader.

22:39.160 --> 22:40.200
just to find it

22:40.440 --> 22:41.960
Confirm the source of the fake identity

22:44.720 --> 22:45.800
I asked the second team to investigate the specific situation

22:45.800 --> 22:47.320
Zhou Chen in the Android smuggling case

22:47.680 --> 22:48.800
get some information

22:49.760 --> 22:50.720
I gonna go see

22:56.040 --> 22:58.200
Here's a June report on Android smuggling

22:58.880 --> 22:59.800
According to our understanding

23:00.040 --> 23:02.640
Xie Wenbiao and his two younger brothers were on the boat at that time

23:03.080 --> 23:06.040
By the way, Brother Biao’s real name is Xie Wenbiao

23:06.640 --> 23:08.520
The smuggling ship is about to enter the port.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.720
As a result, I saw law enforcement officers conducting surprise inspections at the docks.

23:10.920 --> 23:12.400
Xie Wenbiao saw no way to escape

23:12.440 --> 23:14.960
He forced seven robots to jump into the sea with him

23:15.520 --> 23:16.640
he did run away

23:16.800 --> 23:18.280
All robots will sink

23:19.320 --> 23:21.320
Can't robots swim?

23:21.480 --> 23:22.520
I have no idea

23:22.680 --> 23:23.960
But we did an autopsy

23:24.200 --> 23:25.640
Discover the bionic human body

23:25.640 --> 23:27.160
There is a large amount of anesthetic residue

23:27.560 --> 23:30.160
Is giving the medicine first to facilitate transportation?

23:30.160 --> 23:32.760
Yes, they thought they could get ashore.

23:32.920 --> 23:34.240
Just wake up android

23:34.800 --> 23:36.520
Who knew we would encounter a law enforcement boat?

23:36.680 --> 23:38.480
All the robots are sleeping.

23:38.480 --> 23:39.440
Just jump into the sea

23:39.720 --> 23:41.160
Although I can swim

23:41.200 --> 23:42.640
The chance of survival is also very small

23:43.080 --> 23:44.480
only six bodies

23:44.720 --> 23:45.400
It's still us

23:45.400 --> 23:47.040
It took more than a week to find

23:47.440 --> 23:51.200
The other may have been swept away by the current.

23:53.880 --> 23:55.800
Why did you suddenly think of asking about this case?

23:56.480 --> 23:57.640
Any new clues?

23:58.240 --> 23:59.480
This has nothing to do with this case

23:59.880 --> 24:01.000
Kami mencari Xie Wenbiao

24:01.240 --> 24:03.040
He and the robot we are looking for

24:03.040 --> 24:03.960
Contacted

24:04.720 --> 24:07.240
By the way, do you know it exists?

24:07.400 --> 24:09.720
He has just been arrested by the police and is being interrogated

24:10.080 --> 24:12.000
Prepare to eliminate smuggling gangs

24:12.240 --> 24:13.320
Not yet announced

24:13.320 --> 24:15.200
So don’t share it with others for now

24:16.680 --> 24:17.440
very good

24:18.160 --> 24:19.000
take me to see him

24:20.040 --> 24:23.200
Is this a request or a command?

24:25.400 --> 24:26.120
help

24:29.160 --> 24:30.480
Xiaodong went to contact him.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
If you have anything to ask, please let me know.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.280
Did you arrange this order?

24:45.320 --> 24:46.640
Who contacted you at that time?

24:46.880 --> 24:48.200
Is this the man in the photo?

24:48.720 --> 24:49.720
That should be him

24:49.960 --> 24:51.520
I only talked to him on the phone

24:51.520 --> 24:52.720
Did he say that?

24:52.720 --> 24:53.960
Why give up Saiyuan?

24:54.480 --> 24:56.080
I have no idea

25:00.320 --> 25:02.240
At that time, this order had not yet been issued to this person.

25:02.240 --> 25:04.320
I said I won't remember it wrong

25:04.320 --> 25:06.800
I gave it to Sun Yao like this

25:10.440 --> 25:12.280
The woman upstairs is still alive

25:12.920 --> 25:13.520
What

25:13.520 --> 25:15.880
I asked the woman if she was still alive

25:16.320 --> 25:18.560
There are indeed living robots.

25:23.440 --> 25:24.480
You made it very clear

25:24.720 --> 25:25.880
Is this girl a robot?

25:26.440 --> 25:28.000
The boat I was on

25:28.240 --> 25:31.400
If I encounter a law enforcement ship, wouldn't I be unlucky?

25:31.720 --> 25:32.960
If not, my order

25:36.480 --> 25:37.800
Su Zhouchen

25:38.760 --> 25:40.480
The day after the smuggling incident

25:41.000 --> 25:42.880
Have you checked Sun Yao’s family?

25:43.240 --> 25:45.000
In the end, people are still missed.

25:47.520 --> 25:48.440
Wanbu

25:49.080 --> 25:50.240
I'm very sorry

25:50.440 --> 25:53.000
This time I neglected my duty.

25:53.480 --> 25:55.560
But now the evidence is compelling

25:55.560 --> 25:57.560
You can ask Xu for proof of identity.

26:00.680 --> 26:01.400
Cheng Nuo

26:02.000 --> 26:04.080
This time, the three of you will lead a team to collect evidence.

26:04.160 --> 26:05.320
A second team will work with you

26:08.720 --> 26:09.400
Wanbu

26:09.400 --> 26:10.720
Okay, that's it.

26:14.160 --> 26:16.720
The report must also be submitted to the Immigration Service

26:16.880 --> 26:17.800
Must be done well

26:18.760 --> 26:19.640
You all go

26:28.720 --> 26:29.320
minister

26:29.320 --> 26:30.960
I said it was solved

27:18.640 --> 27:19.240
halo

27:19.520 --> 27:20.240
this is me

27:25.160 --> 27:26.200
tomorrow

27:26.920 --> 27:28.240
Do you want to come along?

27:28.440 --> 27:29.080
No

27:29.720 --> 27:30.680
us

27:31.320 --> 27:32.160
us

27:33.520 --> 27:35.240
haven't seen you for a long time

27:53.000 --> 27:54.200
I should have noticed

27:54.320 --> 27:55.720
Sun Yao ingin melindungi Xu Yinian

27:56.000 --> 27:57.240
That's why you've been hiding it from me

27:58.680 --> 28:00.240
do you feel anxious

28:00.240 --> 28:01.960
Sun Yao ditipu oleh Xu Yinian

28:02.480 --> 28:04.880
Still thinking about how to arrest someone?

28:04.880 --> 28:06.080
I saw they complied

28:06.760 --> 28:08.080
I believe Xu Nianniian’s feelings for Sun Yao

28:08.080 --> 28:08.880
that's right

28:09.880 --> 28:11.040
I just don't know

28:12.240 --> 28:13.480
How should I talk to Sun Yao?

28:21.480 --> 28:22.400
Dimana Xu Yinian?

28:23.680 --> 28:24.800
he is not at home

28:31.280 --> 28:32.080
Sun Yao

28:32.760 --> 28:33.480
Come this time

28:33.480 --> 28:36.080
I know, I know you will come this time

28:37.040 --> 28:38.200
What do you want to ask?

28:39.200 --> 28:41.760
Sorry, I lied to you

28:43.640 --> 28:44.920
How did you know each other

28:46.400 --> 28:49.000
Weak start to the year

28:50.920 --> 28:52.160
only a few guests

28:53.040 --> 28:57.240
I drank a lot of wine alone that day

29:30.960 --> 29:31.720
get up

29:33.000 --> 29:34.480
This is where

29:36.960 --> 29:37.760
my house

29:38.720 --> 29:41.440
You passed out on the beach, don't get me wrong.

29:50.960 --> 29:53.160
The following are the recent messages this site has received

29:53.240 --> 29:55.920
Smuggling incident near Taiyuan Beach

29:56.080 --> 29:58.680
It is understood that the cargo ship carries several robots

29:59.240 --> 30:00.240
Is Sun Yao at home?

30:01.480 --> 30:02.240
Sun Yao

30:03.480 --> 30:04.520
Is Sun Yao here?

30:04.520 --> 30:05.720

30:14.400 --> 30:15.440
You are Sun Yao

30:15.960 --> 30:16.520
Canaan

30:16.720 --> 30:18.960
There's something I want to know from you.

30:19.400 --> 30:21.480
Did you go to the beach this morning?

30:21.720 --> 30:23.480
Some fishermen saw you drinking on the beach

30:24.080 --> 30:24.880
What's wrong

30:24.920 --> 30:27.280
You just need to answer yes or no

30:27.560 --> 30:28.320
visited

30:29.000 --> 30:30.480
Have you ever seen anyone suspicious?

30:33.320 --> 30:34.080
No

30:34.760 --> 30:36.000
No special circumstances

30:36.760 --> 30:40.280
No, I was the only one drinking beer.

30:40.640 --> 30:41.720
Go home and sleep

30:47.400 --> 30:48.560
Who else is in your family?

30:50.400 --> 30:51.680
my sweetheart

30:51.680 --> 30:53.000
He doesn't feel well today

30:53.080 --> 30:54.640
I fell asleep just after taking the medicine

30:59.440 --> 31:00.240
How do you feel looking back?

31:00.240 --> 31:01.440
Remember to contact us

31:01.440 --> 31:02.440

31:29.160 --> 31:30.520
Thanks

31:34.560 --> 31:35.280
OK

31:56.480 --> 31:58.040
What are you doing?

31:58.040 --> 31:59.320
I want to repay you

31:59.480 --> 32:00.280
You don't have to pay me back

32:00.280 --> 32:01.960
That's not why I saved you

32:02.920 --> 32:03.760
use use

32:12.720 --> 32:14.160
can I ask you a question

32:17.720 --> 32:18.960
Are you a robot?

32:26.720 --> 32:27.640
you

32:28.720 --> 32:30.160
you can say it slowly

32:36.640 --> 32:38.680
I transferred to Saiyuan

32:39.280 --> 32:42.480
I heard it was because someone offered a high price.

32:42.480 --> 32:43.640
Come and buy from us

32:45.400 --> 32:47.880
We spent a few days at sea

32:48.400 --> 32:49.720
Waiting to go ashore

32:50.640 --> 32:52.640
Unexpectedly, I became the target of others.

32:52.960 --> 32:55.200
The stowaways asked us to jump into the sea and escape

32:55.200 --> 32:56.960
he said if he was caught

32:57.040 --> 32:59.000
we will die

33:07.480 --> 33:11.280
My original obsession was to make my master happy

33:11.480 --> 33:14.400
Cannot refuse any request from the master

33:21.920 --> 33:22.880
Quick to use

33:31.880 --> 33:33.240
Namaku Xu Yinian

33:35.000 --> 33:36.160
My name is Sun Yao

33:58.160 --> 33:59.400
you were a sailor

34:00.160 --> 34:02.920
It must be fun to be a sailor, right?

34:03.440 --> 34:04.160
happy

34:04.880 --> 34:06.880
Sailors just run around

34:07.160 --> 34:10.280
Go to various places to eat various seafood

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Anyway, my family is gone

34:15.480 --> 34:16.440
Don't worry

34:16.520 --> 34:18.400
Wherever I go, it's home

34:32.440 --> 34:33.320
I am

34:36.400 --> 34:38.320
can i be your family

34:52.480 --> 34:54.150
After Xu and I were together for a year,

34:54.560 --> 34:55.670
I also have a start

34:56.760 --> 34:59.640
The most important thing is that he gave me a home

35:01.000 --> 35:02.640
He is my spiritual support

35:07.280 --> 35:08.440
Dimana Xu Yi Nian sekarang?

35:08.440 --> 35:09.440
I let go

35:09.800 --> 35:11.280
The further you go the better

35:11.520 --> 35:13.800
never come back

35:14.640 --> 35:16.080
Cheng Nuo, please.

35:16.960 --> 35:19.320
For the sake of our two long-time brothers,

35:19.480 --> 35:20.880
Leave it alone.

35:21.520 --> 35:22.600
don't let him go

35:23.000 --> 35:23.480
Sun Yao

35:23.480 --> 35:24.800
Didn’t you say that too?

35:25.800 --> 35:27.040
Appreciate the people around you

35:28.120 --> 35:29.000
I beg you

35:30.480 --> 35:31.480
don't let him go

35:32.440 --> 35:33.080

35:39.280 --> 35:40.000
an idea

35:40.520 --> 35:41.280
Itu Xu Yinian

35:44.520 --> 35:45.480
Didn't I let you go?

35:45.480 --> 35:46.800
Why are you back?

35:46.800 --> 35:47.920
I see people with bright eyes coming

35:47.920 --> 35:49.120
I'm worried something happened to you

36:29.600 --> 36:30.760
Nona Xu Yinian

36:31.680 --> 36:33.880
Are you willing to marry Sun Yao?

36:35.200 --> 36:38.200
in sickness and health

36:38.480 --> 36:40.280
poor or rich

36:40.400 --> 36:42.320
for life

36:42.400 --> 36:43.880

36:44.200 --> 36:45.200
