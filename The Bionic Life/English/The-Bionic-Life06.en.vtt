01:26.440 --> 01:27.680
Why did you answer the phone?

01:27.680 --> 01:28.760
Li Yi had a clue.

01:29.120 --> 01:30.120
Li Yi buys chess and pays for it.

01:30.120 --> 01:31.280
This is the personal account I use.

01:31.400 --> 01:32.750
he is now using a fake name

01:32.750 --> 01:34.030
Account name is Li Fei

01:34.120 --> 01:35.750
I checked his bank flow

01:35.840 --> 01:37.200
It has been stable for the past 3 months

01:37.200 --> 01:38.560
Note Recording of salary

01:39.000 --> 01:40.470
Payment is made to a distant shipyard.

01:40.470 --> 01:41.400
The address is on the pier.

01:42.400 --> 01:43.120
An Qiu

01:43.560 --> 01:44.200
An Qiu

01:46.560 --> 01:47.640
What did you say?

01:47.920 --> 01:48.750
I said I looked into it.

01:48.750 --> 01:50.200
the time his last paycheck was deposited

01:50.200 --> 01:51.030
It was yesterday

01:51.120 --> 01:52.400
Clean up and come pick me up

01:52.400 --> 01:53.120
Let's go together

02:05.560 --> 02:06.600
you look tired.

02:07.120 --> 02:09.440
I didn't sleep well last night

02:14.680 --> 02:15.400
That's it

02:16.120 --> 02:17.280
I haven't asked you yet

02:18.160 --> 02:19.240
Are you a local?

02:19.960 --> 02:21.560
Why did you suddenly ask this?

02:22.120 --> 02:23.070
Deepen it

02:23.840 --> 02:24.880
Understanding your partner

02:26.070 --> 02:26.960
I am

02:28.120 --> 02:29.280
you always

02:30.120 --> 02:31.120
Do you live with family?

02:34.680 --> 02:36.560
You talk a lot today.

02:39.120 --> 02:40.070
Isn't that what you said?

02:40.120 --> 02:41.520
outside of work we

02:41.680 --> 02:43.280
I'm not talking about anything else.

02:47.240 --> 02:48.360
it's my turn

02:49.120 --> 02:50.800
How long have you been an investigator?

02:51.520 --> 02:52.680
Probably more than 2 years

02:53.560 --> 02:55.720
It's only been about five years since the recall order was issued.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.880
During the big investigation in the barracks area

02:59.120 --> 03:00.360
you are now on guard

03:01.400 --> 03:02.720
Why didn't you go?

03:06.400 --> 03:07.680
I had some work to do at home at the time.

03:08.880 --> 03:09.800
is that so

03:10.560 --> 03:11.840
But I want to file

03:11.840 --> 03:13.280
I saw your sign

03:15.160 --> 03:16.280
I was supposed to go

03:16.840 --> 03:19.000
I guess I didn't go after that.

03:35.840 --> 03:36.560
Hello

03:36.680 --> 03:38.680
Where is Li Fugui's office?

03:39.600 --> 03:40.600
who are you guys?

03:41.120 --> 03:42.070
we have bright eyes

03:42.120 --> 03:42.960
I've called

03:44.280 --> 03:45.720
Turn right in front and go straight

03:46.160 --> 03:46.960
thank you.

03:51.070 --> 03:53.120
The first one of this L will be all here.

03:55.120 --> 03:56.240
Let's take a look

03:58.680 --> 03:59.440
It's him

04:05.080 --> 04:06.120
Where is this person?

04:06.400 --> 04:08.520
You will be in the dormitory during this time.

04:08.840 --> 04:09.560
We arrived

04:10.720 --> 04:11.840
Li Fei lives in this room

04:15.480 --> 04:16.390
why is there no one

04:18.269 --> 04:19.360
I finished work now

04:19.360 --> 04:21.160
I should probably stay in the dormitory.

04:21.160 --> 04:22.360
where he might go

04:23.160 --> 04:24.480
If you're not here

04:25.040 --> 04:26.360
Probably going to the pier

04:56.800 --> 04:57.840
It's late

05:09.240 --> 05:10.000
stop

05:14.360 --> 05:15.120
stop him

05:16.000 --> 05:16.680
Who is it?

05:17.280 --> 05:18.160
what are you doing

05:41.040 --> 05:42.600
I put down the rice.I put down the rice.

05:43.920 --> 05:44.680
very sorry

05:44.680 --> 05:45.680
walk to the restaurant

05:47.600 --> 05:48.040
What are you doing?

05:49.560 --> 05:49.920
Do not run away

06:50.360 --> 06:51.240
i couldn't catch up

06:51.840 --> 06:52.720
I ran away from him

06:54.400 --> 06:55.150
what happened?

06:56.280 --> 06:57.400
This is Yun Cheonhong

06:58.360 --> 06:59.150
what

07:00.720 --> 07:01.720
They are

07:02.800 --> 07:04.160
the last two violinists

07:11.280 --> 07:12.360
Let's get the evidence first

07:26.800 --> 07:27.600
Cheng Nuo

07:29.360 --> 07:31.120
he is alive

07:43.600 --> 07:45.560
Li Yi had been hiding it well for a long time.

07:46.120 --> 07:48.150
Yoon Chung Heon is also missing.

07:48.240 --> 07:49.800
were they together

07:50.720 --> 07:51.800
Li Yi is dead

07:53.840 --> 07:55.000
our last hope

07:55.360 --> 07:56.600
Only Yun Chun-hong remains.

08:07.600 --> 08:09.160
You are Yun Cheonhong

08:10.360 --> 08:12.000
Do you have any impressions?

08:17.680 --> 08:18.560
what do you mean

08:19.920 --> 08:20.920
nothing

08:21.360 --> 08:23.360
You have been an investigator for a long time.

08:23.360 --> 08:25.040
There are many biomimetic people who come into contact with them.

08:25.400 --> 08:26.720
I think you and him

08:26.720 --> 08:28.480
What kind of contact did you have?

08:34.640 --> 08:35.760
How is the situation now?

08:36.240 --> 08:37.720
The surgery went well, but

08:38.000 --> 08:39.240
But his situation

08:39.360 --> 08:40.480
not very stable

08:40.880 --> 08:42.000
When can he wake up?

08:42.120 --> 08:43.360
because he was bleeding profusely

08:43.360 --> 08:44.480
causes oxygen deficiency in the brain

08:44.720 --> 08:46.320
cause a persistent coma

08:46.960 --> 08:47.960
continuity

08:48.320 --> 08:49.120
How long does it take

08:49.240 --> 08:50.480
This is a little hard to say

08:50.480 --> 08:51.520
Some people are relatively fast

08:51.880 --> 08:53.840
But I can't wake up

08:56.840 --> 08:57.840
adrenaline is

08:58.600 --> 08:59.600
stimulate and wake up

08:59.880 --> 09:02.240
I am a doctor and am responsible only for my patients.

09:02.440 --> 09:03.840
And he just got out of surgery.

09:03.840 --> 09:04.520
still weak

09:04.520 --> 09:06.000
Don't worry, he's a biomimetic and not human.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.360
Do you have an inspection certificate?

09:07.960 --> 09:09.600
I won't stop because of me

09:09.960 --> 09:12.360
Without you, I have no choice but to wait patiently.

09:24.760 --> 09:25.600
Cheng Nuo

09:27.240 --> 09:28.000
Cheng Nuo

09:29.360 --> 09:30.240
Cheng Nuo

09:33.120 --> 09:33.840
where are you going?

09:34.240 --> 09:35.360
take medicine

09:35.520 --> 09:37.000
we know he is a copycat

09:37.000 --> 09:38.440
I don't need to prove anything anymore

09:38.440 --> 09:40.080
You can't move people unless you prove them.

09:40.480 --> 09:41.520
he has to wake up

09:43.640 --> 09:45.600
so you have to give him time

09:45.640 --> 09:46.360
he said he might know

09:46.360 --> 09:47.960
Who is the culprit who killed my mother?

09:48.480 --> 09:50.080
I can't seem to find a clue

09:50.240 --> 09:51.520
It's immoral for you to do that.

09:51.520 --> 09:52.520
i am immoral

09:52.520 --> 09:53.640
for my interest and your interest

09:53.640 --> 09:54.640
fundamentally different

09:54.640 --> 09:56.360
our interests are different

09:56.880 --> 09:58.480
Because I'm worried about you

10:05.720 --> 10:07.240
I know you're in a hurry

10:08.640 --> 10:10.480
But calm down and think about it

10:11.240 --> 10:12.760
Even if I wake up now

10:12.960 --> 10:14.720
I vaguely say something to you

10:14.720 --> 10:15.840
do you believe

10:37.960 --> 10:39.000
i said everything

10:39.120 --> 10:41.080
That murderer can't be from our factory.

10:41.120 --> 10:42.120
I must have misunderstood.

10:42.360 --> 10:43.880
he was wearing your work clothes

10:50.360 --> 10:51.000
Who is this?

10:51.960 --> 10:53.520
this pitch black

10:53.520 --> 10:55.080
I can not see it

10:58.000 --> 10:58.720
this is

10:59.440 --> 11:00.360
wait a minute

11:01.080 --> 11:02.120
Feed Mr. Zhang

11:02.360 --> 11:03.360
Where are those yellows?

11:03.480 --> 11:04.320
find him

11:06.000 --> 11:07.200
I checked the boss

11:07.320 --> 11:09.200
Huang and the others did not return to the dormitory all night yesterday.

11:09.360 --> 11:10.600
I still haven't come to work

11:11.960 --> 11:13.000
I know this boy from Huangda

11:13.000 --> 11:13.960
something has to be done sooner or later

11:14.360 --> 11:14.880
Huang Da

11:14.880 --> 11:16.000
Yes it's him

11:18.120 --> 11:19.240
Not usually quiet

11:19.360 --> 11:20.240
And it's easy to bet

11:24.760 --> 11:25.640
I'd like to ask you a question

11:25.640 --> 11:27.200
Do you know Huang Da and Li Fei?

11:27.200 --> 11:28.120
What kind of relationship do you usually have?

11:28.120 --> 11:29.240
Huang Da I don't know much

11:29.240 --> 11:30.720
I heard that person is quite difficult to deal with.

11:31.240 --> 11:32.360
Lee is not well known to me

11:32.360 --> 11:33.600
Finally, when it comes time to shift

11:33.600 --> 11:34.720
we are often together

11:34.720 --> 11:36.760
These Huang Da and Li Fei belong to the same group.

11:37.000 --> 11:37.840
But the two of them are not very formidable.

11:37.840 --> 11:40.120
It seems like they had a fight the other day.

11:40.120 --> 11:41.080
do you know the cause

11:41.200 --> 11:42.840
Maybe we're not used to seeing each other.

11:42.840 --> 11:44.480
But if you say Li Fei is an imitation

11:44.600 --> 11:46.000
I haven't seen it in a long time

11:46.000 --> 11:47.360
I agree. I didn't see it either.

11:47.360 --> 11:48.120
Did you understand?

11:48.120 --> 11:50.240
It's funny if you guys see it

11:50.520 --> 11:52.240
you are clear-sighted people

11:52.360 --> 11:53.600
What happened

11:55.760 --> 11:57.120
Li Fei you guys just said

11:57.760 --> 11:58.880
was killed last night

11:59.320 --> 12:00.240
His real name is Li Yi

12:00.240 --> 12:02.640
Li Fei was killed.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.720
This is unexpected

12:04.720 --> 12:06.240
Yes they are

12:08.120 --> 12:09.120
Still under investigation

12:09.440 --> 12:11.600
But calling it murder isn't accurate.

12:11.880 --> 12:14.320
Li Fei and another victim

12:14.720 --> 12:15.720
They're all biomimics.

12:15.880 --> 12:17.120
Currently legally

12:17.440 --> 12:19.600
This matter is still qualitatively not good.

12:19.960 --> 12:20.880
is that so

12:20.880 --> 12:22.320
Li Fei Ren is serious

12:22.320 --> 12:23.240
too good to waste

12:23.240 --> 12:25.200
You probably did it on purpose earlier.

12:27.360 --> 12:28.480
If Huang and the others knew

12:28.600 --> 12:29.840
All the dead were biomimics.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.320
legal uncertainty

12:31.440 --> 12:32.880
he is likely to come back

12:34.880 --> 12:35.760
good way

12:36.520 --> 12:38.360
So what's next?

12:40.120 --> 12:41.000
except

12:41.240 --> 12:42.640
There seems to be no other way

12:52.520 --> 12:54.240
In the file that Lee Fugui gave me,

12:54.360 --> 12:56.000
Li Yi has an address.

12:57.520 --> 12:58.880
this address is probably fake

12:59.520 --> 13:01.120
He even tries to forge his identity.

13:01.480 --> 13:02.440
Home Address

13:02.720 --> 13:03.880
I'm sure it was written on my own

13:05.000 --> 13:05.880
I know

13:06.120 --> 13:07.000
But what happened?

13:07.000 --> 13:08.640
This may also be a clue

13:28.360 --> 13:29.000
old man

13:29.080 --> 13:29.880
I'd like to ask you a question

13:29.880 --> 13:31.720
Is this Ling'an Street Thirty-Three?

13:33.720 --> 13:34.720
Have you seen this person?

13:38.120 --> 13:39.760
Grandpa knows him, Grandpa.

13:46.120 --> 13:47.080
Are you okay

13:48.720 --> 13:49.840
What happened?

13:55.240 --> 13:56.480
Is this really helpful?

13:57.880 --> 13:59.360
Any other way?

13:59.600 --> 14:01.480
Torture or intimidation?

14:03.600 --> 14:04.880
Li Yi is a copycat who got away.

14:04.880 --> 14:05.760
he has a good age

14:05.760 --> 14:06.840
It must be used

14:15.240 --> 14:16.000
old man

14:16.240 --> 14:17.720
We are Li Yi's friends.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
May I come inside and talk?

14:26.080 --> 14:27.720
grandpa's sheets

14:27.720 --> 14:28.760
Where is Li Yi?

14:29.760 --> 14:30.760
Li Yi

14:32.200 --> 14:33.440
he works on the pier

14:35.000 --> 14:36.880
Why didn't you go to the pier?

14:39.840 --> 14:41.440
Grandpa, I'll be honest with you.

14:41.600 --> 14:42.840
We are clear-eyed investigators.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.640
We have to make you understand Li Yi.

14:45.080 --> 14:47.480
Investigator Meibou

14:47.720 --> 14:48.960
something

14:48.960 --> 14:50.000
Grandpa, please open the door. we will explain to you.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.480
Where on earth is Li Yi?

14:51.480 --> 14:52.960
Grandpa, don't get excited.

14:53.120 --> 14:55.120
Li Yi has something to do now, but he hasn't come back yet.

14:55.120 --> 14:56.720
Can you tell me where Li Yi is?

14:56.760 --> 14:57.600
i won't open the door

15:05.840 --> 15:06.720
Li Fugui said.

15:06.880 --> 15:07.960
Huang and the others returned to the factory.

15:08.080 --> 15:08.760
go

15:08.840 --> 15:09.960
I just left

15:10.760 --> 15:11.520
Otherwise

15:11.720 --> 15:13.200
You also saw how strong his character was.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.600
I can't hear anything for a while

15:14.720 --> 15:16.000
It is important to catch Huang and the others first.

15:16.240 --> 15:18.120
He had been hearing about Li Yi for a long time.

15:18.120 --> 15:19.480
they must have something to do with it

15:19.480 --> 15:20.480
So I

15:20.480 --> 15:21.480
Unless you tell me where Li Yi is going.

15:21.480 --> 15:22.760
he says nothing

15:23.200 --> 15:23.960
also

15:24.440 --> 15:25.720
Speaking of Lee Yi being dead.

15:27.760 --> 15:28.840
I really have to go

15:33.000 --> 15:33.720
i won't go

15:34.720 --> 15:36.360
I'm here to act when I see an opportunity.

15:36.600 --> 15:37.480
Go ahead

15:47.640 --> 15:48.360
It's here

15:52.000 --> 15:52.720
People

15:53.240 --> 15:54.600
Workers can hear their voices here

15:54.600 --> 15:56.080
When I arrived, I finally realized that it was Huang and the others.

15:56.480 --> 15:57.600
But people couldn't catch up

15:57.640 --> 15:58.640
I let it escape after all

15:58.960 --> 16:00.600
he seems to be looking for something

16:00.600 --> 16:01.440
Look, this turned over.

16:04.440 --> 16:06.000
What Huang and the others were looking for

16:07.240 --> 16:08.360
It's at Li Yi's place.

16:13.120 --> 16:15.760
thief catches thief

16:15.760 --> 16:16.480
old man

16:17.200 --> 16:17.880
old man

16:18.080 --> 16:19.000
Are you okay

16:19.600 --> 16:21.000
Grandpa open the door

16:21.360 --> 16:22.120
old man

16:25.640 --> 16:26.240
thief

16:26.240 --> 16:27.480
Grandpa, what about you?

16:27.760 --> 16:28.480
quick

16:30.200 --> 16:31.120
Huang Da

16:35.320 --> 16:36.240
Huang Da

16:39.440 --> 16:41.080
Huang and the others stop

16:45.760 --> 16:47.360
who are you

16:47.600 --> 16:48.360
You probably killed Li Yi.

16:49.320 --> 16:50.480
I don't understand what you're saying.

16:50.480 --> 16:52.080
Even innocent people will insist on evidence.

16:53.320 --> 16:54.080
look at me

16:55.120 --> 16:56.720
You probably already knew that Li Yi was a copycat.

16:57.600 --> 16:58.960
Because the other person is an imitation

16:59.240 --> 17:00.480
you came up with the idea of ​​making money

17:00.720 --> 17:01.760
It's not just about killing people.

17:01.760 --> 17:02.720
You tried to steal his money, right?

17:02.720 --> 17:03.880
I didn't steal his money

17:04.000 --> 17:05.310
The money was originally mine

17:15.960 --> 17:16.640
old man

17:23.520 --> 17:24.880
Yoshi-chan

17:25.720 --> 17:27.960
What happened

17:34.040 --> 17:35.240
Li Yi last night

17:36.760 --> 17:38.240
killed on the pier

17:41.320 --> 17:42.040
old man

17:44.080 --> 17:46.400
Who killed it?

17:47.040 --> 17:48.240
we have doubts

17:48.640 --> 17:50.480
The culprit is a factory worker.

17:54.960 --> 17:56.680
There are so many people in the factory

17:57.520 --> 17:59.880
Why are you targeting him more than anything?

18:02.880 --> 18:05.040
Is it because he is an imitation?

18:09.200 --> 18:11.720
you know he's a copycat

18:17.000 --> 18:18.960
I am doing business together with Lee Yi.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.400
he took all the money with him

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Are you kidding me?

18:22.880 --> 18:23.680
The two of you are not compatible

18:23.680 --> 18:25.000
How can we do business together?

18:27.440 --> 18:29.920
I realized that he had created a false identity.

18:30.760 --> 18:32.880
I kept your identity for two years.

18:33.160 --> 18:33.800
this is the certificate

18:33.800 --> 18:34.720
Please check it out

18:35.400 --> 18:36.440
The promised money?

18:37.000 --> 18:38.080
Let's find out

18:41.000 --> 18:43.280
Why is the money so much more than what was promised?

18:44.280 --> 18:46.520
please keep the secret

18:47.040 --> 18:48.200
Please rest assured about this

18:48.200 --> 18:49.040
i did this

18:49.040 --> 18:50.080
Can I tell you outside?

18:50.920 --> 18:52.920
be careful

19:06.040 --> 19:07.040
What are you doing here?

19:07.480 --> 19:08.280
give me things back

19:10.200 --> 19:12.000
you are an imitation

19:12.400 --> 19:13.440
Don't lie, I'm different

19:13.440 --> 19:14.640
lower your voice

19:14.640 --> 19:16.720
Don't move your hands, don't put your hands out

19:16.960 --> 19:17.880
what do you want to do?

19:18.200 --> 19:19.280
What do you say you want to do?

19:19.480 --> 19:20.720
It can not be helped

19:21.080 --> 19:22.520
Where did so much money come from?

19:22.880 --> 19:23.880
made money from business

19:25.000 --> 19:26.400
What kind of business can you make so much money from?

19:26.400 --> 19:27.800
May I call you?

19:27.800 --> 19:29.720
I'll check if this is good

19:29.720 --> 19:30.720
tell me the number

19:31.160 --> 19:32.400
How much does it cost to shut up?

19:34.000 --> 19:34.800
Even though you are forcing the other person

19:34.800 --> 19:36.040
Why did you say you would do business together?

19:37.080 --> 19:38.560
he gave me money

19:38.720 --> 19:40.200
I am responsible for keeping secrets

19:40.200 --> 19:41.280
Isn't this business?

19:42.640 --> 19:44.240
You really are a thug.

19:44.720 --> 19:45.480
i ask you

19:45.680 --> 19:46.680
last night

19:46.760 --> 19:47.720
Why did you go there?

19:47.760 --> 19:48.720
Did you promise?

19:49.040 --> 19:50.240
There is no promise

19:52.040 --> 19:53.240
i am from the past

19:54.320 --> 19:56.480
Last night I saw him go towards the ruins

19:56.520 --> 19:57.760
I think it's a chance

19:58.240 --> 20:00.000
I waited outside for a while.

20:00.480 --> 20:01.960
At first there were still noises.

20:02.200 --> 20:03.280
Then I lost my voice

20:03.720 --> 20:04.960
i thought it was weird

20:05.160 --> 20:06.480
That's why I entered

20:37.240 --> 20:38.720
the rest of you know

20:38.720 --> 20:39.960
I'm not really lying

20:39.960 --> 20:41.320
I didn't really kill the person.

20:41.480 --> 20:43.080
i like to bet money

20:44.720 --> 20:45.640
Jeez

20:46.320 --> 20:47.040
Cheng Nuo

20:51.040 --> 20:52.800
Grandpa wants to go somewhere

21:23.320 --> 21:25.560
Why don't you let me take you?

21:25.560 --> 21:27.320
No, I don't want you guys to take him.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.040
he is an imitation

21:29.160 --> 21:30.680
There is a specific treatment method

21:30.920 --> 21:31.880
Shori

21:33.240 --> 21:34.720
what are you going to do with him?

21:34.960 --> 21:35.640
old man

21:35.680 --> 21:37.280
he's not bothering you

21:37.280 --> 21:39.320
he just did what he had to do

21:39.720 --> 21:40.400
old man

21:44.200 --> 21:46.000
Grandpa, don't get excited.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.320
Please listen to us.

21:47.400 --> 21:48.520
everyone go

21:48.720 --> 21:50.800
Please let me stay a little longer with Yoshi-chan.

21:53.080 --> 21:57.200
Yoshi-chan is a compassionate child.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.480
He helped me too much these past few years.

22:19.280 --> 22:20.240
who are you looking for?

22:21.800 --> 22:23.200
I was just taking shelter from the rain here.

22:23.680 --> 22:24.720
i go now

22:25.640 --> 22:27.680
You must be hungry.

22:27.920 --> 22:28.760
wait

23:00.920 --> 23:03.640
Then Yoshi-chan realized that I was sick.

23:03.800 --> 23:06.480
He ran around collecting money for me.

23:07.240 --> 23:08.960
i left him here

23:10.000 --> 23:13.400
I can't spend the rest of my life

23:15.280 --> 23:16.680
open the door first

23:16.680 --> 23:18.640
I know what it feels like to never be able to go through life.

23:21.000 --> 23:21.920
1 year ago

23:24.200 --> 23:26.440
My mother committed suicide by falling from her workplace.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.320
We haven't been on good terms for a long time.

23:30.880 --> 23:32.480
I saw the last part of her

23:33.240 --> 23:34.480
We had a big fight

23:36.040 --> 23:37.080
1 month ago

23:38.240 --> 23:39.480
found out about her death

23:40.480 --> 23:41.560
There is another reason

23:42.320 --> 23:43.640
The culprit who killed Li Yi

23:43.640 --> 23:45.000
likely to know something

23:46.240 --> 23:48.200
I can't console your man.

23:49.040 --> 23:50.920
Because I know the pain of losing a family member.

23:52.240 --> 23:53.480
I can't let go of that forever

23:56.160 --> 23:57.320
But I really

23:58.320 --> 23:59.200
i really want to know

23:59.200 --> 24:00.680
The truth about my mother's death

24:01.760 --> 24:04.000
So I want to find the person who killed them

24:05.640 --> 24:06.320
old man

24:07.240 --> 24:08.320
Could you please help us?

24:18.560 --> 24:20.720
How would you like to help?

24:22.160 --> 24:24.000
Does Li Yi have a grudge with someone these days?

24:26.320 --> 24:28.160
This child is so quiet

24:28.480 --> 24:29.920
Who can you hold a grudge with?

24:30.000 --> 24:31.520
he is the work of an imitator

24:31.520 --> 24:33.560
Does anyone know besides you?

24:34.200 --> 24:36.440
I too know the danger of his status.

24:36.480 --> 24:38.560
I couldn't tell anyone

24:39.240 --> 24:40.200
Huangda theory

24:40.720 --> 24:42.040
Li Yi used to do business with people.

24:42.040 --> 24:43.040
made a lot of money

24:43.680 --> 24:44.800
Have you heard of it?

24:45.160 --> 24:47.200
I don't know what kind of business they are in.

24:47.480 --> 24:48.880
But since I got sick

24:49.320 --> 24:52.160
This kid makes money here and there.

24:52.400 --> 24:53.520
I kept telling him

24:53.520 --> 24:55.320
This disease can't be cured

24:55.480 --> 24:56.480
But during this time

24:56.520 --> 24:58.760
He said an old friend would help.

24:59.200 --> 25:00.160
old friend

25:01.000 --> 25:02.240
Who does he say he is?

25:03.800 --> 25:05.080
What on earth does that mean?

25:05.200 --> 25:06.720
Why did those people disappear?

25:07.200 --> 25:08.440
you said you would help us

25:09.080 --> 25:10.200
That's a lie, right?

25:11.560 --> 25:12.480
you are lying

25:13.400 --> 25:14.760
I do not lie

25:16.760 --> 25:18.720
Tomorrow night, he will go to the shipyard and wait for me to finish my work.

25:23.960 --> 25:25.000
who is that person

25:25.680 --> 25:26.560
old friend

25:28.000 --> 25:28.720
Let's enter

25:34.000 --> 25:34.960
some time ago

25:35.920 --> 25:37.240
you surprise me so much

25:38.640 --> 25:40.160
i think you are the one

25:40.720 --> 25:42.000
All I can see is the incident

25:42.080 --> 25:44.240
People who only think about side punches

25:45.640 --> 25:48.200
But in reality, I am that domineering person.

25:48.960 --> 25:51.040
i think i know someone else

25:51.560 --> 25:52.440
But the truth is

25:52.440 --> 25:53.440
not considered at all

25:53.440 --> 25:54.760
Grandpa's feelings

25:57.400 --> 25:58.160
thank you

25:59.400 --> 26:00.480
took the class

26:05.240 --> 26:06.200
actually

26:06.520 --> 26:08.040
I go to your school.

26:16.480 --> 26:17.240
Cheng Nuo

26:17.960 --> 26:20.080
Unless the suspect is Huang and the others

26:20.480 --> 26:21.480
it's only a possibility

26:21.480 --> 26:23.200
The old friend that the old man mentioned earlier

26:23.280 --> 26:24.440
But Li Yi

26:24.960 --> 26:26.480
Why did those people disappear?

26:26.760 --> 26:27.720
What do you mean

26:28.960 --> 26:30.160
those people

26:30.480 --> 26:31.800
I think they are in the same group as Lee Yi.

26:31.880 --> 26:33.280
deported copycat

26:33.480 --> 26:35.040
About the murdered imitator

26:36.960 --> 26:38.960
Li Yi and Yun Cheonhong are the last two.

26:39.440 --> 26:40.440
old friend

26:41.080 --> 26:42.680
I wonder if it's Yun Cheon-hong?

26:46.680 --> 26:48.000
The culprit may not have disappeared.

26:48.920 --> 26:50.320
It was wrong from the beginning

26:55.480 --> 26:56.320
fell to the ground

26:57.160 --> 26:58.240
one is a victim

26:58.680 --> 26:59.280
Another 1

27:00.240 --> 27:01.680
Might be the culprit

27:13.440 --> 27:15.000
Tomorrow night, he will go to the shipyard and wait for me to finish my work.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.480
In order to avoid suspicion, Yun Chun-hong

28:12.800 --> 28:14.640
made myself a victim

28:32.040 --> 28:33.520
That wound cuts so deep

28:34.040 --> 28:35.520
isn't he afraid of dying?

28:35.560 --> 28:36.960
he kills people and paints

28:37.800 --> 28:39.400
They're making murder into a game in the first place.

28:39.800 --> 28:40.680
let's guess him

28:41.720 --> 28:43.160
I no longer care about my life

28:43.560 --> 28:44.920
if he didn't die

28:45.720 --> 28:47.400
what is he going to do next?

28:48.040 --> 28:49.200
Yun Tianhong is still in the hospital.

28:49.480 --> 28:50.240
no one is watching

28:59.720 --> 29:01.160
You guard the elevator and I walk the stairs
