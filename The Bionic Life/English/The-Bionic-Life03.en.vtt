00:15.800 --> 00:16.520
Lu Yan

00:17.320 --> 00:18.000
Cheng Nu

00:24.000 --> 00:25.200
Have you seen anyone running out?

00:25.640 --> 00:27.400
There is a red birthmark on the face while wearing a hat

00:29.440 --> 00:30.600
Have you seen anyone running past you?

00:30.600 --> 00:31.760
He was wearing a hat and had a red mark on his face

00:31.760 --> 00:32.840
Have you seen anyone running past you?

00:33.000 --> 00:33.840
with red birthmark

00:33.840 --> 00:34.280
I did not see it

00:34.280 --> 00:34.840
Cheng Nu

00:34.840 --> 00:35.240
did you see

00:35.240 --> 00:36.320
clam down

00:36.320 --> 00:37.320
I'm really sorry

00:37.320 --> 00:38.400
sorry

00:38.680 --> 00:40.440
Who did you see?

00:51.240 --> 00:52.520
dead, dead

00:52.520 --> 00:53.680
Another robot dies

00:53.680 --> 00:54.560
Someone died again

00:54.560 --> 00:55.680
Another robot dies

00:55.840 --> 00:57.080
Where are you?

00:57.080 --> 00:57.840
Rubbish

00:57.840 --> 00:58.920
I heard it's the same as before

00:58.920 --> 01:00.560
There are boards around, take me there, take me there

01:00.560 --> 01:01.760
Helped me walk around the store

01:01.760 --> 01:02.640
go! go! go

01:03.560 --> 01:04.480
go! go! go

01:05.200 --> 01:06.120
let's see

01:06.320 --> 01:06.920
Another robot dies

01:06.920 --> 01:07.640
What a mess

01:07.640 --> 01:08.920
Why is there another one? Take a look

01:09.480 --> 01:10.560
Just asking you if you are afraid

01:11.280 --> 01:12.320
What about the excitement you promised?

01:12.400 --> 01:13.920
Look at the paintings on this earth.

01:13.920 --> 01:15.280
What does it mean?

01:21.760 --> 01:22.840
This is Android

01:23.560 --> 01:24.840
Contact the recycling department

01:25.480 --> 01:26.680
Let people regain their bright eyes

01:27.680 --> 01:28.760
When did people die?

01:28.840 --> 01:30.120
So how do I know?

01:30.120 --> 01:31.840
I also saw it when I came here

01:32.200 --> 01:33.470
Someone died a few days ago

01:33.470 --> 01:34.750
Isn't this another kind of death?

01:34.750 --> 01:35.920
Are there any other Android devices?

01:35.920 --> 01:36.680
Yes I have

01:37.030 --> 01:37.840
right there

01:38.680 --> 01:39.280
take me there

01:39.280 --> 01:40.000
he goes

02:02.960 --> 02:04.360
This is where people are found

02:04.560 --> 02:05.560
where was found

02:05.560 --> 02:07.000
I really don't know this yet

02:07.560 --> 02:09.160
but i heard what they said

02:09.360 --> 02:10.840
when the body was found

02:10.840 --> 02:12.000
Now there is only one breath left

02:12.360 --> 02:14.600
It was also put into a very strange shape

02:14.600 --> 02:16.120
There are many pictures and texts drawn next to it

02:16.400 --> 02:17.560
Anyway, it's weird

02:18.120 --> 02:19.160
Have you met this person?

02:22.120 --> 02:23.280
Take a closer look

02:23.280 --> 02:24.600
There is a red birthmark on his face

02:25.280 --> 02:26.400
don't like it that much

02:26.400 --> 02:27.440
Is he a murderer?

03:23.720 --> 03:24.400
minister

03:25.120 --> 03:25.960
Where is the young girl?

03:27.280 --> 03:28.840
I'm not sure

03:30.440 --> 03:32.520
Why are you acting alone again?

03:35.400 --> 03:37.560
What's wrong? What's wrong?

03:50.280 --> 03:52.600
Today we met someone on the old street

03:53.000 --> 03:53.960
Lu Yan called

03:54.360 --> 03:56.240
Qingnu continues to chase him

03:56.680 --> 03:58.720
I asked him who he was, but he didn't answer me.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Minister, you know this man

04:09.600 --> 04:11.000
After meeting Lu Yan

04:11.120 --> 04:13.560
Cheng Nuo's whole situation is very strange

04:14.000 --> 04:15.840
I know this is his private matter

04:16.160 --> 04:18.920
But I think as a partner

04:18.920 --> 04:21.240
We must have basic confidence

04:21.480 --> 04:22.800
I should know him better

04:28.040 --> 04:29.600
The mother of the young girl Chang Ya

04:30.040 --> 04:32.480
Once upon a time, a bright-eyed Android researcher

04:32.720 --> 04:35.240
Lu Yan is one of her partners

04:36.280 --> 04:37.360
but

04:43.840 --> 04:45.400
but a year ago

04:46.800 --> 04:48.360
Zhang Ya committed suicide by jumping off the building

04:50.040 --> 04:51.150
And before she died

04:51.240 --> 04:53.400
The last call was made to Lu Yan

04:54.240 --> 04:55.280
after her death

04:56.360 --> 04:57.280
Lu Yan

04:58.480 --> 04:59.360
also missing

06:00.480 --> 06:02.720
The four victims did not know each other.

06:02.720 --> 06:04.360
no common friends

06:04.360 --> 06:06.240
Even if I live far away

06:06.600 --> 06:09.240
These four cases have two things in common:

06:09.480 --> 06:10.160
first

06:10.280 --> 06:12.360
All victims are robots

06:12.720 --> 06:13.480
second

06:13.600 --> 06:14.920
After the murderer committed the crime

06:14.920 --> 06:17.600
He will leave your twin horoscope on the spot

06:18.920 --> 06:20.480
same murder ritual

06:20.600 --> 06:22.400
same way of working

06:22.840 --> 06:25.280
Basically it can be judged as a serial crime.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.480
There are some things in common

06:31.240 --> 06:32.920
They are all related to Lao Jie

06:36.040 --> 06:37.000
Are you OK

06:38.800 --> 06:41.240
Chen Xinhui has nothing to do with Lao Jie, right?

06:41.480 --> 06:42.600
Not important at first glance

06:42.840 --> 06:43.920
But I checked

06:44.150 --> 06:46.150
When Fang Yuan’s mother bought it,

06:46.800 --> 06:48.120
Just on the old street

06:49.150 --> 06:50.800
How would the murderer know?

06:50.800 --> 06:52.240
They are all Android

06:52.840 --> 06:55.120
The murderer may be interested in Lao Cai's robot business

06:55.120 --> 06:56.240
I understand very well

06:56.360 --> 06:57.720
So we guess

06:57.840 --> 07:00.280
The murderer is probably a resident of Laoji

07:00.720 --> 07:02.800
The environment on the old street is a mixed bag.

07:03.160 --> 07:04.240
Our work

07:04.720 --> 07:05.720
may be difficult

07:05.720 --> 07:07.040
Even if you walk from house to house

07:08.600 --> 07:09.680
I want to take it out too

07:22.280 --> 07:23.920
Auntie, have you seen this person?

07:24.240 --> 07:24.920
go! go! go

07:24.920 --> 07:27.000
I am bright-eyed detective An Qiu

07:27.000 --> 07:29.600
We're investigating two Android murders

07:29.600 --> 07:30.480
I have never met anyone as good as you.

07:30.480 --> 07:32.040
Do you know this person?

07:32.240 --> 07:33.150
Have you met this person?

07:33.150 --> 07:34.560
Many stray cats and dogs die every day

07:34.560 --> 07:35.840
show me

07:35.920 --> 07:36.840
Do you know this person?

07:36.840 --> 07:38.680
Isn't this the robot that died nearby?

07:38.680 --> 07:40.000
Have you heard of this?

07:40.000 --> 07:41.400
I've never seen this before, have you seen this photo?

07:41.400 --> 07:41.920
I do not recognize

07:41.920 --> 07:42.920
No impression at all?

07:42.920 --> 07:43.600
Really not

07:45.360 --> 07:46.360
Buy a bird?

07:51.840 --> 07:53.120
Hello, have you met this person?

07:53.600 --> 07:54.720
No impression, no impression

07:56.800 --> 07:58.240
Hello, have you met this person?

07:58.240 --> 07:59.040
unprecedented

08:02.480 --> 08:03.840
Hello, have you met this person?

08:09.040 --> 08:10.160
Have you met this person?

08:24.280 --> 08:25.800
I ask you if you know this person

08:27.600 --> 08:28.600
may i know your name

08:28.960 --> 08:30.200
may i know your name

08:31.480 --> 08:32.960
I said what's your name

08:33.240 --> 08:35.000
I said what's your name

08:35.720 --> 08:37.880
I asked what your name is

08:37.880 --> 08:39.760
I asked what your name is

08:44.120 --> 08:44.840
welcome

08:45.480 --> 08:46.480
Her name is Qiu

08:47.440 --> 08:48.120
And you

08:48.640 --> 08:50.360
Hello, my name is An Qiu, and you are

08:59.480 --> 09:01.600
It's your name, isn't it?

09:02.080 --> 09:03.080
Your name is Yihang

09:08.640 --> 09:10.440
Did you draw all these pictures?

09:14.720 --> 09:17.320
What is the name of this painting?

09:18.120 --> 09:21.200
Moulin Rouge ball

09:21.520 --> 09:22.240
Red

09:30.080 --> 09:31.600
So what are you painting now?

09:32.080 --> 09:32.840
Now

09:34.600 --> 09:35.240
Now

09:35.720 --> 09:36.320
Cheng Nu

09:37.200 --> 09:38.240
Qingnu, who painted this?

09:38.240 --> 09:39.120
Qingnuo is you, right?

09:39.120 --> 09:40.120
Where is this person in the painting?

09:40.120 --> 09:40.960
Look at the young girl

09:41.080 --> 09:42.120
What's your job

09:42.520 --> 09:43.640
Who are you?

09:43.640 --> 09:45.360
Your son went to the scene where the robot was killed.

09:45.480 --> 09:46.880
Maybe it has something to do with this

09:46.880 --> 09:47.760
Lopsided

09:47.840 --> 09:48.840
My son has nothing to do with this

09:48.840 --> 09:49.640
It doesn't matter

09:49.760 --> 09:50.240
No problem, no problem

09:50.240 --> 09:50.440
No problem, no problem

09:50.440 --> 09:51.080
It's okay, Yihang

09:51.080 --> 09:52.120
Nice painting

09:54.200 --> 09:55.760
Don't leave, come back

09:55.760 --> 09:57.120
Why are you cursing my son?

09:57.360 --> 09:58.480
What evidence do you have?

09:59.120 --> 10:00.760
Cheng Nuo goes first

10:02.600 --> 10:03.600
Go quickly

10:13.080 --> 10:14.320
Are you late enough?

10:15.480 --> 10:17.200
It's no use at all

10:17.200 --> 10:18.640
He must be autistic

10:18.640 --> 10:19.960
Originally, communication with the outside world already existed

10:19.960 --> 10:21.000
Did you hear what he said?

10:21.000 --> 10:22.360
He said there was a lot of blood

10:22.360 --> 10:23.600
Lu Yan was also present

10:23.600 --> 10:24.360
Most likely they are together

10:24.360 --> 10:24.760
Kill the robots you know.

10:24.760 --> 10:26.000
I heard

10:27.320 --> 10:28.640
you need to calm down

10:28.720 --> 10:30.480
you are completely out of control

10:31.520 --> 10:32.480
I'm calm

10:32.600 --> 10:33.640
I don't need you to teach me

10:54.120 --> 10:55.600
I'm very sorry

10:55.720 --> 10:57.880
I've caused you a lot of trouble

11:02.360 --> 11:03.240
Actually I don't know

11:03.240 --> 11:05.000
How to take care of this child

11:07.480 --> 11:09.360
Is what I just said true?

11:12.120 --> 11:14.760
We're not sure yet

11:15.520 --> 11:16.760
But the person we're looking for

11:16.760 --> 11:18.480
This is one of Yihang’s paintings

11:21.240 --> 11:22.360
We doubt

11:22.840 --> 11:24.880
He is a killer robot

11:29.760 --> 11:32.440
I always feel like I know my kids very well

11:33.720 --> 11:35.720
But sometimes I think it's weird

11:36.880 --> 11:38.320
I still don't understand

11:39.000 --> 11:40.200
Why Yang

11:40.440 --> 11:41.760
appear in every painting of yours

11:41.760 --> 11:43.480
add yourself to it all

11:44.480 --> 11:45.720
if he doesn't

11:46.760 --> 11:48.240
Where could there be so much trouble?

11:51.520 --> 11:52.840
per panel

11:52.840 --> 11:54.520
Would you like to add yourself to all of this?

12:01.640 --> 12:02.360
look

12:15.840 --> 12:16.880
of course i hope

12:17.080 --> 12:18.840
Yihang has nothing to do with this matter

12:19.360 --> 12:21.120
But only by finding the truth

12:21.320 --> 12:22.880
Only in this way can we really help him

12:23.360 --> 12:25.840
Do you know where he could go?

13:43.360 --> 13:44.080
a trip

13:47.000 --> 13:47.840
Don't worry

13:48.320 --> 13:49.600
I'm just asking you some questions

13:49.840 --> 13:51.880
Can I just answer truthfully?

13:54.640 --> 13:55.600
I said this afternoon

13:55.880 --> 13:57.320
What does heavy bleeding mean?

13:59.520 --> 14:00.840
lots of blood

14:01.080 --> 14:01.640
correct

14:01.640 --> 14:02.520
lots of blood

14:02.520 --> 14:03.520
Yihang, look at me

14:04.760 --> 14:05.960
Have you ever harmed a robot?

14:06.600 --> 14:07.440
harm robot

14:07.440 --> 14:09.320
There is another trip, go check it out

14:09.880 --> 14:11.120
Who taught you to draw that painting?

14:11.480 --> 14:12.720
who painted it

14:13.240 --> 14:14.440
Yihang, look at me

14:14.440 --> 14:15.720
Who taught you to draw that painting?

14:15.720 --> 14:16.360
dyeing

14:18.200 --> 14:19.440
Is he the person in the painting?

14:20.320 --> 14:21.480
One trip, one trip

14:23.120 --> 14:23.840
a trip

14:24.000 --> 14:24.520
Cheng Nu

14:24.520 --> 14:25.240
a trip

14:25.360 --> 14:26.080
Cheng Nu

14:26.400 --> 14:27.840
a trip

14:31.240 --> 14:32.200
What's your job

14:32.200 --> 14:33.360
He is not a killer

14:33.360 --> 14:35.000
I saw him paint that painting with my own eyes

14:35.240 --> 14:36.120
If he is not the murderer

14:36.120 --> 14:37.080
How do you draw a scene where a body is thrown?

14:37.080 --> 14:38.120
many details

14:38.200 --> 14:39.600
This is his talent

14:39.600 --> 14:41.240
He can imitate other people's paintings

14:41.240 --> 14:42.120
can also be accurately

14:42.120 --> 14:43.720
draw what you see

14:43.720 --> 14:45.240
Well, in the afternoon he said he was bleeding a lot.

14:45.240 --> 14:46.240
exactly what this means

14:46.480 --> 14:48.120
Qingnu, please calm down first.

14:49.720 --> 14:52.320
Yihang usually wanders around the ancient streets.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.880
I've heard others say

14:53.960 --> 14:55.360
Previous Android system

14:55.440 --> 14:56.600
Just lying in the alley like this

14:56.600 --> 14:57.760
Next to the trash can

14:57.760 --> 14:59.480
Maybe Yihang saw him

14:59.480 --> 15:00.840
so i drew them

15:00.840 --> 15:02.080
Yihang may be an eyewitness

15:02.080 --> 15:02.960
It's the same in the painting

15:02.960 --> 15:04.360
You told me he was a witness

15:04.720 --> 15:07.200
He integrates himself into every painting

15:07.600 --> 15:09.200
He wants everyone to know him

15:09.200 --> 15:10.120
He wants everyone to know

15:10.200 --> 15:11.760
All the paintings were painted by him

15:13.960 --> 15:15.480
This is all your guess

15:15.960 --> 15:17.360
Even if he is a witness

15:17.480 --> 15:18.840
Then why didn't he mention who the person in the painting was?

15:18.840 --> 15:19.600
Where

15:22.880 --> 15:25.240
Do you really want to find the murderer?

15:34.120 --> 15:34.960
What does it mean

15:35.720 --> 15:37.120
Your mother committed suicide

15:38.240 --> 15:40.360
Will finding Lu Yan change this ending?

15:45.480 --> 15:46.240
Yes

15:48.120 --> 15:49.720
The result cannot be changed

15:50.720 --> 15:51.960
but i just want to know

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Does my mother's death have anything to do with me?

16:18.360 --> 16:19.360
birthday every year

16:20.080 --> 16:21.000
she works

16:23.960 --> 16:24.720
Gradually

16:25.640 --> 16:27.480
I don't care about celebrating her birthday with her

16:28.000 --> 16:29.240
You no longer have any extravagant hopes

16:35.240 --> 16:35.960
but

16:37.240 --> 16:38.480
I was fifteen years old that year

16:39.760 --> 16:41.600
She even remembered my age wrongly

16:43.200 --> 16:43.960
compared to me

16:44.600 --> 16:46.360
She is more interested in studying robots

16:48.720 --> 16:50.360
She studied hard and got into a prestigious school

16:51.360 --> 16:52.720
All for her to see me

16:53.240 --> 16:55.000
Mom, I'm accepted

16:55.000 --> 16:55.840
MIT

16:57.120 --> 16:57.840
OK

16:59.560 --> 17:01.000
This is a full scholarship

17:02.560 --> 17:04.000
i know you will be accepted

17:06.560 --> 17:08.440
But no matter what I achieve

17:09.400 --> 17:11.800
In her eyes, everything seemed normal.

17:27.920 --> 17:29.280
robot to some extent

17:29.280 --> 17:31.400
More paranoid and extreme than us

17:31.560 --> 17:34.200
But I think they still have a chance to improve

17:35.480 --> 17:36.480
Give up famous schools

17:37.000 --> 17:38.320
Be a keen-eyed detective

17:39.000 --> 17:40.040
This time, I want

17:40.400 --> 17:41.520
She can take me seriously now

17:42.760 --> 17:43.920
I even did this

17:43.920 --> 17:45.200
Be prepared to be scolded by her

17:47.240 --> 17:48.080
If you have any questions, you can come to me anytime

17:48.080 --> 17:48.720
Yes

17:48.720 --> 17:49.480
You're welcome

17:50.880 --> 17:51.560
Teacher Chang

17:52.640 --> 17:53.880
Cheng Nuo came to our department

18:01.920 --> 18:03.000
why are you here

18:05.000 --> 18:05.880
Friends, let’s talk first

18:09.720 --> 18:10.680
What's the situation now?

18:11.000 --> 18:12.200
I'm not going to MIT

18:13.280 --> 18:14.240
I want to work here

18:15.080 --> 18:16.480
I also want to study Android

18:25.640 --> 18:26.560
your life

18:27.200 --> 18:28.440
make your own decision

18:41.160 --> 18:42.160
What's your job

18:42.240 --> 18:42.960
go away

18:45.480 --> 18:46.200
Cheng Nu

18:55.160 --> 18:55.880
money loss

18:56.480 --> 18:57.200
Cheng Nu

18:57.200 --> 18:58.000
money loss

19:08.160 --> 19:09.320
Let me go

19:10.520 --> 19:11.560
Let me go

19:14.160 --> 19:15.640
Why fight robots?

19:16.160 --> 19:17.440
they will get hurt

19:22.720 --> 19:23.480
you only care about them

19:23.480 --> 19:25.040
Did you see that I was hurt too?

19:25.200 --> 19:26.400
Qingnu, you have grown up

19:26.800 --> 19:27.680
independent

19:27.680 --> 19:29.080
You have to learn how to calm down

19:29.640 --> 19:31.000
Instead of hurting the robot

19:31.000 --> 19:32.160
to vent dissatisfaction

19:35.720 --> 19:36.720
Since you like Android so much

19:37.480 --> 19:38.520
Why did you give birth to me?

19:38.720 --> 19:40.520
Let these robots be your children

20:11.240 --> 20:12.280
she has

20:13.080 --> 20:14.440
I've always been redundant

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
So I blocked her phone messages

20:20.400 --> 20:21.800
Then she disappeared from her world

20:25.240 --> 20:26.200
until that day

21:15.480 --> 21:17.440
This is your mother's body. Please sign it.

22:04.480 --> 22:06.240
Don’t you hate Android?

22:08.800 --> 22:09.760
only you

22:10.720 --> 22:12.680
you want your mother's attention

22:14.080 --> 22:15.680
I always say she doesn't care about me

22:18.760 --> 22:20.440
but i don't actually care about it

22:21.480 --> 22:23.280
I didn't even know she had depression

22:25.640 --> 22:27.800
Until the last words I said to her

22:30.400 --> 22:32.000
They both allowed the robot to become her child.

22:39.760 --> 22:41.720
Do you still remember Yihang’s paintings?

22:48.040 --> 22:49.440
Lu Yan's paintings

22:49.800 --> 22:51.160
Just wear this necklace

22:55.800 --> 22:57.000
Xia Qing

22:58.800 --> 22:59.800
you know her

23:00.520 --> 23:01.520
Lu Yan's wife

23:02.400 --> 23:03.800
He died in a car accident a year ago

23:04.400 --> 23:05.320
where do you find it

23:05.880 --> 23:07.000
Rubbish

23:34.240 --> 23:35.040
give me your hand

23:36.640 --> 23:37.760
give me your hand

23:44.280 --> 23:45.040
I am fine

23:45.040 --> 23:45.960
do not move

24:01.720 --> 24:02.960
More than two hours have passed

24:03.440 --> 24:04.480
Lu Yan hasn’t come yet

24:05.240 --> 24:06.720
maybe he won't come

24:08.240 --> 24:09.280
I guess

24:10.480 --> 24:11.480
maybe so

24:11.760 --> 24:13.480
It’s your psychological analysis again

24:13.760 --> 24:14.960
No analysis required

24:15.440 --> 24:17.480
Everyone wants to get back what they lost

24:48.160 --> 24:50.760
you are always awake

24:52.240 --> 24:53.160
I can not sleep

24:57.240 --> 24:58.200
Thanks

25:02.560 --> 25:03.720
stop staring and walk away

25:05.240 --> 25:06.080
Why

25:07.000 --> 25:08.040
I've been waiting all night

25:08.040 --> 25:09.080
he won't come back

25:09.240 --> 25:10.800
Can your body handle it?

25:10.920 --> 25:12.720
I am fine

25:12.920 --> 25:13.800
forgotten

25:14.080 --> 25:15.480
Wait until you are cold and then rely on me

25:15.520 --> 25:16.240
let's go

25:16.240 --> 25:17.480
Are you worried about me?

25:23.280 --> 25:24.040
wait a little longer

25:25.880 --> 25:26.680
Why

25:26.920 --> 25:28.320
You've been staring at me for a long time

25:28.320 --> 25:29.720
I don't care about this moment either.

25:31.720 --> 25:33.320
Go to sleep, I'll watch over you

25:41.040 --> 25:41.720
Cheng Nu

25:42.000 --> 25:42.880
he came

25:48.680 --> 25:50.000
He will run away later

25:50.240 --> 25:51.560
Don't worry yet

25:51.800 --> 25:53.680
What he is looking for is in our hands.

25:53.800 --> 25:55.320
Better to wait and see where it goes

26:05.440 --> 26:06.480
Believe me

26:41.480 --> 26:42.240
clear

26:42.520 --> 26:43.240
clear

26:54.680 --> 26:55.480
What’s wrong with you

26:57.640 --> 26:58.400
there is nothing

27:01.640 --> 27:03.000
No wonder I can’t find Lu Yan

27:03.680 --> 27:05.000
It turns out he is hiding here

27:06.640 --> 27:07.320
he goes

27:17.480 --> 27:18.240
OK

27:19.280 --> 27:20.480
I'm leaving now

27:22.440 --> 27:23.280
almost

28:10.240 --> 28:11.000
Cheng Nu

28:47.440 --> 28:49.200
Do you know Lu Yan?

28:53.000 --> 28:55.240
Then why did he lock you up?

28:59.760 --> 29:00.920
It's okay if you don't want to say it

29:01.480 --> 29:02.480
Lu Yan killed someone

29:03.160 --> 29:04.560
and kidnapping of teenagers and children.

29:04.560 --> 29:05.920
Now let’s collect the stolen goods together

29:05.920 --> 29:07.080
when he comes back

29:07.080 --> 29:08.240
Put him directly in jail

29:08.240 --> 29:09.520
Uncle Lu Yan is a good man

29:10.000 --> 29:11.040
You can't catch him

29:11.200 --> 29:12.800
Uncle Lu Yan is a good man

29:16.440 --> 29:17.280
children

29:18.040 --> 29:19.040
Jain

29:19.040 --> 29:19.960
Jain

29:23.160 --> 29:24.200
why are you here

29:27.480 --> 29:28.920
Why kill these robots?

29:29.560 --> 29:30.720
I didn't kill them

29:31.000 --> 29:31.560
then your necklace

29:31.560 --> 29:33.200
Why did he appear in the burial ground?

29:33.520 --> 29:34.480
Where is my necklace?

29:34.680 --> 29:35.240
give to me

29:35.240 --> 29:36.280
Do you want to say it or not?

29:36.440 --> 29:38.640
I didn't actually kill those robots.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.400
Yesterday I met you on the old street

29:40.400 --> 29:42.520
That's because I just heard someone died

29:43.000 --> 29:44.240
That's why I went to take a look

29:45.240 --> 29:46.480
How to explain these three children?

29:46.480 --> 29:47.240
you can go now

29:48.720 --> 29:49.960
these three children

29:50.320 --> 29:52.280
They were all street children I met along the way.

29:52.280 --> 29:54.040
I help them find foster homes.

29:54.320 --> 29:55.720
I haven't really killed anyone.

29:59.720 --> 30:01.400
The last time my mother called

30:03.000 --> 30:04.280
What was said specifically?

30:05.440 --> 30:06.520
Do you really think so?

30:08.240 --> 30:09.480
Did Zhang Ya commit suicide?

30:10.200 --> 30:11.160
What does it mean

30:11.320 --> 30:12.800
She can't commit suicide

30:14.280 --> 30:16.480
Shortly after the Android recall was announced

30:16.680 --> 30:17.720
Founded by Zhang YaA

30:17.720 --> 30:19.240
Robotics Research Laboratory

30:20.920 --> 30:22.440
After the laboratory was established, I...

30:23.480 --> 30:24.440
Just joined

30:25.640 --> 30:26.480
I'm from Mingmo headquarters

30:26.480 --> 30:28.200
Apply for collection of human body electronic information

30:28.200 --> 30:29.640
Thanks to Dr. Zhang for the research

30:30.320 --> 30:32.680
She said she wanted to try psychotherapy

30:32.680 --> 30:33.960
Find and destroy the robots

30:33.960 --> 30:35.560
main obsession method

30:35.560 --> 30:38.160
Let them better integrate into human society

30:39.920 --> 30:41.000
But not long after

30:41.240 --> 30:42.720
Zhang Ya suddenly called and said

30:43.000 --> 30:43.920
Stop research project

30:44.920 --> 30:46.480
She asked me to go to the lab to find her

30:47.200 --> 30:49.240
But I didn't find it in the lab

30:49.640 --> 30:50.320
from

30:51.280 --> 30:52.760
But I saw this number

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
Leave the lab

30:57.240 --> 30:58.440
So why not chase it?

30:58.760 --> 30:59.400
this time

30:59.400 --> 31:00.920
Dr. Zhang Ya falls from building

31:02.040 --> 31:02.960
I just want to keep

31:02.960 --> 31:04.960
What I put in the safe

31:05.320 --> 31:07.920
This is electronic body data about to be investigated.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.480
Her story remains a secret

31:14.760 --> 31:16.000
Have you seen what it looks like?

31:17.760 --> 31:19.160
Why did the murderer take her away?

31:22.440 --> 31:23.240
he

31:25.480 --> 31:26.200
Quiet

31:28.240 --> 31:29.400
this list

31:29.400 --> 31:30.680
I haven't given it to Dr. Zhang yet.

31:31.080 --> 31:33.080
Later I heard that many androids died.

31:33.960 --> 31:35.480
Then I investigated

31:36.240 --> 31:37.680
found dead

31:38.000 --> 31:38.920
All from the same batch

31:38.920 --> 31:40.960
Robots deliver dazzling headquarters

31:42.200 --> 31:43.480
So you go to the dump

31:44.320 --> 31:45.960
To confirm the identity of the deceased

31:48.720 --> 31:50.200
I've been looking for you this year

31:50.200 --> 31:51.160
Why are you hiding this from me?

31:51.400 --> 31:52.560
Why do you run when you see me?

31:54.960 --> 31:56.160
Zhang Ya passed away

31:56.800 --> 31:58.320
I didn't hide it from you on purpose.

31:59.040 --> 32:01.080
it's because of fear

32:02.640 --> 32:03.520
afraid of what

32:03.880 --> 32:05.640
Don't know the murderer's purpose

32:06.160 --> 32:07.760
But it must have something to do with the laboratory

32:08.920 --> 32:09.720
after all

32:10.080 --> 32:11.560
I'm also involved

32:11.960 --> 32:13.200
kill me and silence me

32:15.560 --> 32:17.040
it's just a matter of time

32:18.160 --> 32:19.920
These robots are in the list

32:19.920 --> 32:21.480
Are these two the only ones left alive?

32:24.160 --> 32:25.960
that's all i can tell you
