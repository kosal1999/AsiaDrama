00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
[With English subtitles]

00:06.520 --> 00:07.710
This is the near future.

00:08.700 --> 00:11.100
Gene editing technology is developing rapidly.

00:11.690 --> 00:14.290
A scientific life form called a "humanoid"

00:14.660 --> 00:15.660
has been created.

00:16.920 --> 00:18.380
Physiological Structure of Humanoids

00:18.410 --> 00:20.290
Almost the same as humans.

00:20.850 --> 00:21.980
the only difference

00:22.050 --> 00:24.020
are the neurons in their brains

00:24.270 --> 00:26.160
Gene editing has been done in some way.

00:26.460 --> 00:30.240
They have a single original obsession that they must abide by.

00:31.170 --> 00:32.680
They can be loyal spouses
until the end of their lives.

00:32.870 --> 00:34.210
They can be docile and filial children.

00:34.630 --> 00:36.140
They can become employees who are loyal to their bosses.

00:36.420 --> 00:39.170
These custom-made humanoids begin circulating

00:39.250 --> 00:40.870
as a commodity on a global scale.

00:41.610 --> 00:43.500
Even in some producing countries

00:43.500 --> 00:45.180
Selling humanoid robots is illegal,

00:45.240 --> 00:46.790
There are still lawless people

00:47.070 --> 00:48.450
who brought

00:48.640 --> 00:50.360
Humanoids entering their country without permission

00:50.520 --> 00:51.660
and sell them secretly.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.670
With the widespread spread of humanoid creatures,

00:54.870 --> 00:56.330
Their risks gradually became apparent.

00:57.050 --> 00:58.230
more and more people

00:58.260 --> 00:59.070
Become addicted to

00:59.100 --> 01:01.130
Fake emotions provided by humanoids.

01:01.990 --> 01:03.750
As for the humanoids themselves,

01:04.200 --> 01:05.750
their thoughts and emotions

01:05.780 --> 01:07.960
easily transformed

01:07.990 --> 01:09.130
Within the limits of initial obsession.

01:09.440 --> 01:11.710
Many vicious events occurred as a result.

01:13.350 --> 01:15.240
Facing
the increasingly severe situation,

01:15.370 --> 01:17.470
The international community
quickly convened a meeting.

01:17.840 --> 01:20.010
Humanoid robot production bans
and recalls

01:20.250 --> 01:21.250
Passed unanimously.

01:22.090 --> 01:22.970
According to the agreement,

01:23.110 --> 01:25.720
All countries will immediately stop producing humanoid robots.

01:26.330 --> 01:28.130
They should also recall and centralize management

01:28.160 --> 01:30.240
All humanoids in their country.

01:31.680 --> 01:33.300
Xin Genomics Institute

01:33.320 --> 01:35.500
It was soon established in Xiyuan City.

01:35.680 --> 01:38.300
It's to cooperate with the police

01:38.330 --> 01:40.430
Find and identify
our country's humanoid creatures.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.580
However, the process was not smooth.

01:46.770 --> 01:48.380
The only way to identify humanoids

01:48.380 --> 01:50.670
Just inject identification drugs

01:50.700 --> 01:52.870
Then observe whether the pupils change color.

01:53.330 --> 01:55.970
But there are still flaws in identifying drugs.

01:56.280 --> 01:58.600
It is very harmful to ordinary people.

01:59.200 --> 02:02.220
Therefore, its use is strictly restricted.

02:03.080 --> 02:04.130
Until now,

02:04.380 --> 02:06.120
five years have passed

02:06.150 --> 02:07.790
After the humanoid ban was enacted.

02:08.490 --> 02:10.000
There are still some humanoids

02:09.080 --> 02:12.600
[bionic life]

02:10.440 --> 02:12.170
living among us.

02:13.490 --> 02:15.150
[episode 1]

02:28.850 --> 02:30.630
[Xin Genomics Institute]

03:05.720 --> 03:06.600
[Investigation Group Three]

03:07.550 --> 03:08.620
Sorry I'm late.

03:09.070 --> 03:09.840
What's happening here?

03:10.720 --> 03:11.480
Let's start.

03:16.890 --> 03:17.610
Let's start.

03:19.180 --> 03:19.790
deceased

03:20.260 --> 03:20.880
Is a woman.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.350
Three days ago,

03:23.380 --> 03:25.310
She broke into a spa hotel armed with weapons.

03:25.390 --> 03:27.780
She ended up injuring a mother and her son in the room.

03:27.570 --> 03:28.820
[The monster wields a knife late at night, and a 10-year-old boy risks his life to save his mother]

03:28.010 --> 03:29.400
In order to protect my mother,

03:29.440 --> 03:31.000
The kid stabbed the mad woman to death.

03:31.290 --> 03:32.470
She fell into the fire pit

03:32.850 --> 03:33.810
Her face was burned.

03:34.660 --> 03:35.710
The body was severely burned,

03:35.730 --> 03:37.540
So it cannot be identified.

03:37.890 --> 03:39.040
The deceased was unidentified.

03:39.380 --> 03:41.940
And it doesn't match files that have been lost over the past few months.

03:42.130 --> 03:43.640
So the police need our cooperation

03:43.660 --> 03:45.550
Go through the identification process

03:45.650 --> 03:47.660
Check to see if she is a humanoid.

03:49.040 --> 03:50.560
Her body was severely burned

03:51.440 --> 03:52.660
You can't even see her pupils.

03:52.690 --> 03:53.710
Of course, medicine doesn't work either.

03:53.950 --> 03:55.610
Our job will be difficult.

03:56.150 --> 03:58.060
Even if she is in human form,

03:58.290 --> 03:59.410
She is dead.

03:59.620 --> 04:00.890
The Sheen Genome Institute does not need to be involved.

04:01.270 --> 04:01.910
Right, Cheng Nuo?

04:03.560 --> 04:04.610
What's the expression on this kid's face?

04:08.320 --> 04:09.830
Didn't he just kill someone?

04:10.580 --> 04:12.120
No matter how mature he is,

04:12.420 --> 04:13.550
He shouldn't be so calm.

04:16.360 --> 04:16.790
let's go.

04:18.329 --> 04:19.040
We will take over the case.

04:41.390 --> 04:42.400
Because of thunderstorm weather,

04:42.430 --> 04:43.730
Surveillance camera signals are affected,

04:43.750 --> 04:45.010
So they were on and off.

04:45.940 --> 04:48.159
I heard a loud noise

04:48.159 --> 04:49.300
from upstairs.

04:49.360 --> 04:50.710
I checked the CCTV and something felt wrong.

04:51.120 --> 04:52.630
Then I ran up.

04:53.080 --> 04:54.460
We will obtain a copy of the surveillance video.

04:55.070 --> 04:55.780
no problem.

04:58.620 --> 04:59.920
Police cordoned off the room

04:59.950 --> 05:01.130
After they got the evidence.

05:01.160 --> 05:02.530
They won't let us in for now.

05:03.270 --> 05:04.360
if you want to go in

05:04.390 --> 05:05.190
you can...

05:06.450 --> 05:07.420
What happened to him?

05:08.450 --> 05:09.100
sorry.

05:16.580 --> 05:18.470
When the mother and son were taken away by the police,

05:18.470 --> 05:19.440
are u there?

05:19.440 --> 05:20.870
I was on duty in the lobby that day.

05:22.020 --> 05:23.240
How is the child?

05:23.410 --> 05:24.270
Is he scared?

05:24.680 --> 05:25.680
Not really.

05:28.130 --> 05:29.510
The rooms on both sides were unoccupied.

05:29.600 --> 05:32.000
There is a couple living in room 0210.

05:32.159 --> 05:33.070
How long were they there?

05:33.420 --> 05:34.440
They booked the room for 7 days.

05:36.020 --> 05:36.630
gentlemen.

05:36.650 --> 05:38.250
You can't knock on the door like this.

05:40.370 --> 05:42.040
What are you doing? Why are you knocking so loudly?

05:42.070 --> 05:43.450
Miss Wang, I'm sorry to bother you.

05:43.610 --> 05:45.120
The two men are researchers at the Xin Genome Institute.

05:45.120 --> 05:45.860
They have some questions to ask.

05:45.890 --> 05:46.720
Aren't you done yet?

05:46.720 --> 05:47.940
You've asked this many times!

05:47.960 --> 05:49.190
Please repeat.

05:51.190 --> 05:53.110
I'm telling you for the last time.

05:53.750 --> 05:54.740
That day,

05:54.770 --> 05:56.020
I heard someone walking back and forth

05:56.050 --> 05:56.960
in the corridor.

05:57.330 --> 05:58.310
then i heard someone

05:58.330 --> 05:59.470
Knock on every door.

05:59.909 --> 06:00.620
after that,

06:00.650 --> 06:02.230
I heard a loud noise.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.180
I pushed my boyfriend at that time.

06:04.200 --> 06:05.040
He was sound asleep.

06:05.070 --> 06:05.800
Did she knock on your door too?

06:06.100 --> 06:06.730
Yes.

06:06.730 --> 06:07.530
I walked near the door

06:07.530 --> 06:08.450
and scolded her.

06:08.700 --> 06:09.840
I thought some drunkard was drunk

06:09.860 --> 06:10.630
And went to the wrong door.

06:10.880 --> 06:12.680
But nothing happened after that.

06:12.950 --> 06:13.550
wait.

06:14.370 --> 06:15.240
you mean

06:15.830 --> 06:17.540
She left when she heard your voice?

06:17.570 --> 06:18.240
Yes.

06:19.080 --> 06:20.460
Thinking about it now, I'm really scared.

06:20.610 --> 06:21.860
- she must be looking
- by the way

06:21.890 --> 06:22.740
-Some specific goals.
-when will you

06:22.760 --> 06:23.670
Give me mental compensation?

06:23.700 --> 06:24.520
If you don't leave I won't leave.

06:24.550 --> 06:25.810
Did you hear anything else?

06:26.500 --> 06:27.850
after that i heard

06:27.870 --> 06:28.930
Very loud noise.

06:29.280 --> 06:31.260
I also heard a woman scream,

06:31.290 --> 06:32.560
“Let go of my child.

06:32.590 --> 06:33.630
Let go of my child! "

06:35.040 --> 06:36.300
Since you and the people from Xin Genomics Institute are here,

06:36.610 --> 06:38.280
Is that crazy woman in human form?

06:38.360 --> 06:39.659
——He must have killed that person
——Cheng Nuo.

06:39.690 --> 06:40.610
To save his mother.

06:40.909 --> 06:41.860
Stop making wild guesses.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.470
Thanks.

06:45.500 --> 06:46.840
You have come a long way to get here.

06:47.300 --> 06:47.720
here.

06:51.420 --> 06:53.170
But I don't think I can help you

06:53.490 --> 06:55.060
with what you asked.

06:55.130 --> 06:56.380
we just doubt

06:56.770 --> 06:58.060
The person who attacked you that day

06:58.130 --> 06:59.200
Possibly a humanoid.

07:00.360 --> 07:01.230
Humanoid?

07:02.880 --> 07:03.940
I have no idea.

07:04.900 --> 07:07.080
I am really scared.

07:07.510 --> 07:09.290
I've told you all I can remember.

07:09.460 --> 07:10.250
Ms. Chen,

07:10.520 --> 07:11.570
Where is your son?

07:11.730 --> 07:12.780
We want to see him.

07:14.330 --> 07:15.500
sorry.

07:15.800 --> 07:16.950
He is sleeping.

07:17.150 --> 07:18.540
It was not easy for him to fall asleep.

07:19.080 --> 07:21.280
Do you want to talk to him?

07:21.590 --> 07:23.430
I know everything he knows.

07:24.170 --> 07:25.250
Can I tell you?

07:25.480 --> 07:25.990
certainly.

07:26.430 --> 07:28.070
can you tell us

07:28.620 --> 07:30.750
What happened when you were attacked the day before yesterday?

07:34.590 --> 07:37.060
Yuan won second place in the piano competition.

07:37.530 --> 07:38.500
I agreed

07:38.830 --> 07:40.670
Take him to a hot spring hotel to stay for two days.

07:44.380 --> 07:45.840
Did you have fun today?

07:45.880 --> 07:46.470
Yes.

07:47.540 --> 07:48.480
Have sweet dreams.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.000
who is it?

08:33.490 --> 08:34.789
Let go of my child.

08:35.100 --> 08:36.270
Let go of my child!

08:53.360 --> 08:54.440
Yuan, run!

09:23.400 --> 09:24.770
This is what happened.

09:29.900 --> 09:30.950
Who do you think she is?

09:31.290 --> 09:32.550
Why did she attack you?

09:33.050 --> 09:33.850
tramp?

09:34.100 --> 09:34.980
or

09:34.980 --> 09:36.450
People in mental hospitals?

09:36.700 --> 09:37.440
or

09:38.740 --> 09:39.890
A humanoid, as we suspected?

09:42.770 --> 09:43.380
But it doesn't matter.

09:44.330 --> 09:45.150
If she were in human form

09:45.690 --> 09:46.690
It will be easier for us to deal with her.

09:48.600 --> 09:49.250
Ms. Chen,

09:51.970 --> 09:52.890
you know

09:53.390 --> 09:54.560
What do we do, right?

09:56.550 --> 09:57.240
Xin Genome Institute.

09:58.460 --> 10:00.280
You specialize in humanoids.

10:00.660 --> 10:01.600
then you should know

10:02.610 --> 10:03.500
The dangers of humanoids, right?

10:05.180 --> 10:05.650
Ms. Chen,

10:06.690 --> 10:08.020
Is there anything else you want to tell us?

10:09.540 --> 10:10.750
You'd better do it now.

10:13.430 --> 10:14.980
I have nothing more to say.

10:15.490 --> 10:16.500
sorry.

10:17.570 --> 10:19.040
I need to cook for my kids.

10:56.960 --> 11:03.710
[Please trust humans again]
[We will take you home]

12:15.030 --> 12:16.430
Let go of my child.

12:16.460 --> 12:18.010
Let go of my child!

12:27.590 --> 12:28.930
Let go of my child.

12:28.930 --> 12:30.440
Let go of my child!

12:54.860 --> 12:55.620
Hello.

12:55.760 --> 12:57.440
We are researchers at the Xin Genome Institute.

12:57.470 --> 12:59.420
We would like to ask Fang Yuan some questions.

12:59.450 --> 13:00.630
I need to check with his parents.

13:00.630 --> 13:01.680
Please wait.

13:07.430 --> 13:08.100
Cheng Nuo.

13:14.790 --> 13:15.550
Fang Yuan.

13:15.700 --> 13:17.190
We are researchers at the Xin Genome Institute.

13:17.210 --> 13:18.130
No introduction is needed to us.

13:18.240 --> 13:19.030
We've met before.

13:19.400 --> 13:19.940
correct?

13:24.450 --> 13:25.500
Let me show you something.

13:27.530 --> 13:28.290
Take a look.

13:29.630 --> 13:30.680
Do you know this deceased person?

13:37.150 --> 13:38.010
can you speak?

13:39.380 --> 13:39.930
Hey.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.040
Why are you completely unresponsive?

13:41.070 --> 13:41.380
Cheng Nuo.

13:41.410 --> 13:42.460
what are you doing here?

13:43.300 --> 13:44.770
How could you break in here?

13:44.790 --> 13:46.300
What are you going to do to him?

13:46.330 --> 13:47.270
I just asked him a few questions.

13:47.300 --> 13:48.090
about what?

13:48.090 --> 13:49.260
My son's actions were self-defense.

13:49.260 --> 13:50.190
He didn't do anything wrong.

13:50.210 --> 13:51.290
Stop pestering him.

13:51.370 --> 13:52.930
We will cooperate with the police to find out the truth

13:53.070 --> 13:54.540
If your son's actions were legitimate self-defense.

13:54.580 --> 13:55.400
Please leave.

13:58.930 --> 14:00.690
Has he always been so silent?

14:00.720 --> 14:01.360
go out!

14:02.330 --> 14:03.660
Cheng Nuo, let’s go.

14:04.760 --> 14:05.410
Cheng Nuo.

14:08.440 --> 14:09.230
sorry.

14:12.680 --> 14:14.110
Do you think it's normal for him to be like this?

14:14.130 --> 14:14.760
he didn't say anything

14:14.790 --> 14:15.590
Has he since that incident?

14:15.610 --> 14:16.670
You just scared him.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.010
He's just a kid.

14:18.040 --> 14:19.250
He just wanted to protect his mother.

14:19.590 --> 14:20.980
How can you say he is a murderer?

14:21.400 --> 14:22.330
This is not what we need to confirm

14:22.360 --> 14:23.980
What if the victim is a humanoid?

14:24.280 --> 14:25.460
Why do you keep pestering your children?

14:25.460 --> 14:26.570
Dead people cannot speak.

14:26.590 --> 14:27.620
They said they did not know the attacker.

14:27.650 --> 14:28.530
Chen Xinhui said so.

14:28.550 --> 14:29.250
Fang Yuan hasn't spoken yet.

14:29.280 --> 14:29.780
does it matter?

14:29.800 --> 14:30.430
Yes.

14:32.510 --> 14:34.340
Is it possible to solve a crime only by injuring someone?

14:37.480 --> 14:38.720
Then you can try your method.

14:47.780 --> 14:48.580
Fang Yuan,

14:49.740 --> 14:51.210
I will protect you.

14:51.410 --> 14:52.400
Mom is here,

14:52.420 --> 14:53.720
You don't need to worry about anything.

14:53.750 --> 14:54.420
It doesn't matter.

14:54.830 --> 14:55.670
It doesn't matter.

15:03.770 --> 15:06.610
[Hualan Psychological Clinic]

15:05.650 --> 15:06.700
You did very well today.

15:06.730 --> 15:07.920
Make sure you eat well at home.

15:07.920 --> 15:08.420
OK

15:08.420 --> 15:09.340
he is still there

15:09.370 --> 15:11.090
Called our nanny every day.

15:11.420 --> 15:13.820
I see. This is just a process.

15:13.930 --> 15:15.640
You should spend more time with him.

15:15.720 --> 15:17.250
Don't put too much pressure on him.

15:17.390 --> 15:18.610
OK, thanks.

15:18.630 --> 15:19.080
goodbye.

15:24.740 --> 15:25.370
Advanced.

15:26.500 --> 15:27.260
An Qiu.

15:28.400 --> 15:29.070
sorry.

15:29.110 --> 15:30.030
This time I came in a hurry,

15:30.060 --> 15:31.110
So I didn't tell you in advance.

15:31.290 --> 15:32.060
It doesn't matter.

15:32.090 --> 15:32.840
What's wrong?

15:33.020 --> 15:34.350
I won’t beat around the bush.

15:34.380 --> 15:35.070
Here's the thing.

15:36.130 --> 15:36.730
I know

15:37.160 --> 15:38.590
you are good at

15:38.640 --> 15:39.540
psychological problems.

15:39.980 --> 15:41.340
We happen to have a case

15:41.540 --> 15:42.700
We would like to ask you to help us.

15:44.210 --> 15:46.250
Is it about humanoids?

15:47.700 --> 15:49.150
Yes and no.

15:49.430 --> 15:50.900
We're not sure yet.

15:51.060 --> 15:53.490
Those involved have refused to speak.

15:53.770 --> 15:55.110
So I want you to take a look.

15:55.660 --> 15:57.060
-Multiple sclerosis. Zhang.
-I want to see my husband.

15:57.410 --> 15:58.080
Miss Zhang, don't run!

15:58.120 --> 16:00.220
He is not a humanoid. He is not!

16:00.240 --> 16:00.800
You go back first.

16:00.820 --> 16:01.580
Let me go!

16:01.610 --> 16:02.640
It's okay, Miss Zhang.

16:02.660 --> 16:04.640
I have a lot of people here who need help.

16:04.970 --> 16:05.830
sorry.

16:06.440 --> 16:07.370
I see.

16:08.030 --> 16:08.720
but

16:09.970 --> 16:12.450
This case is a bit special.

16:12.650 --> 16:14.920
The person involved
was a ten-year-old child.

16:15.420 --> 16:17.100
he killed someone

16:17.560 --> 16:18.570
To protect his mother.

16:26.730 --> 16:27.530
Advanced.

16:27.900 --> 16:28.660
An Qiu.

16:29.980 --> 16:31.120
They're already inside.

16:31.560 --> 16:32.480
Let me take you inside.

16:32.510 --> 16:33.270
OK

16:41.420 --> 16:42.090
Ms. Chen.

16:43.150 --> 16:43.900
Sit here.

16:47.280 --> 16:48.070
Ms. Chen.

16:48.580 --> 16:49.210
sorry.

16:49.230 --> 16:51.370
My colleague was too impulsive last time.

16:51.370 --> 16:52.250
But don't worry.

16:52.250 --> 16:53.760
We will not discuss the case this time.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.950
we are worried

16:55.950 --> 16:57.420
After experiencing these things

16:57.640 --> 16:59.080
Fang Yuan was under too much mental pressure.

16:59.310 --> 17:00.270
So I specially invited

17:00.290 --> 17:01.420
Psychology expert.

17:01.520 --> 17:02.730
Hope she can help Fang Yuan.

17:03.080 --> 17:04.240
Hello, Ms. Chen.

17:04.260 --> 17:05.190
My name is An Qiu.

17:05.810 --> 17:07.359
Can I chat with Fang Yuan?

17:11.339 --> 17:12.730
Hello, Fang Yuan.

17:13.060 --> 17:14.550
Can I chat with you?

17:18.700 --> 17:20.750
if you don't say no

17:20.780 --> 17:22.480
Can I assume this is a yes?

17:24.140 --> 17:24.900
Fang Yuan.

17:25.079 --> 17:27.220
In fact, compared with this case,

17:27.329 --> 17:28.430
We care more about you.

17:28.770 --> 17:30.500
but if you remain silent

17:30.780 --> 17:31.920
We don't know how to help you.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.550
It's okay, Fang Yuan.

17:35.550 --> 17:37.780
I totally understand how you feel.

17:38.600 --> 17:39.560
how about this?

17:39.730 --> 17:41.540
Let's play a little game.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.200
We don’t need to talk in this game.

17:43.660 --> 17:44.560
do you know?

17:44.800 --> 17:47.440
I became a psychologist

17:47.570 --> 17:49.740
Because I have the power of the mind.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.120
I have telepathy.

17:52.650 --> 17:53.500
Do you want to try it?

17:58.390 --> 17:59.900
Let me play with you first.

17:59.940 --> 18:00.700
certainly.

18:01.200 --> 18:02.510
The game is very simple.

18:02.510 --> 18:04.350
This game is called Black Magic.

18:04.370 --> 18:05.340
Ms. Chen,

18:05.370 --> 18:07.430
Please point out any position of Fang Yuan

18:07.460 --> 18:08.450
For Mr. Shen.

18:08.480 --> 18:09.450
and then,

18:09.570 --> 18:11.140
I'll tell you the answer

18:11.160 --> 18:12.220
Use my telepathic powers.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.180
let's start.

18:17.330 --> 18:18.970
Ms. Chen, you are ready to begin.

18:19.210 --> 18:19.790
OK

18:27.150 --> 18:27.900
Did you finish it?

18:29.040 --> 18:29.790
Yes.

18:31.660 --> 18:33.640
Please cooperate with Mr. Shen.

18:33.730 --> 18:34.490
no problem.

18:41.990 --> 18:43.090
Is this this place?

18:43.110 --> 18:45.440
Ms. Chen pointed?

18:46.550 --> 18:47.320
No.

18:47.550 --> 18:48.520
is it here?

18:49.220 --> 18:49.870
No.

18:50.460 --> 18:51.390
is it here?

18:51.970 --> 18:52.460
No.

18:53.490 --> 18:54.100
is it here?

18:55.200 --> 18:55.960
No.

18:56.890 --> 18:57.460
Then...

18:58.020 --> 18:58.640
is it here?

19:00.310 --> 19:00.860
Yes.

19:07.200 --> 19:08.590
Do you doubt it?

19:08.610 --> 19:10.450
Mr. Shen gave me some tips?

19:10.450 --> 19:11.640
You must have discussed it beforehand

19:11.670 --> 19:12.950
and agree that the fifth is the correct answer.

19:13.830 --> 19:14.710
It's not like that.

19:14.730 --> 19:16.120
Do you use your eyes to communicate?

19:16.150 --> 19:17.330
Not really.

19:18.310 --> 19:19.030
how about this?

19:19.270 --> 19:20.490
Let's play it again.

19:20.880 --> 19:22.770
Think about your favorite dessert

19:23.040 --> 19:24.260
And only told Mr. Shen.

19:24.990 --> 19:26.220
I won't look at you this time either.

19:31.090 --> 19:31.810
hurry up.

19:34.620 --> 19:36.010
Almond jelly.

19:39.320 --> 19:41.890
Fang Yuan’s favorite dessert? ? ?

19:41.970 --> 19:42.810
ice cream?

19:43.850 --> 19:44.380
No.

19:44.870 --> 19:45.710
Yeah

19:45.810 --> 19:46.820
Black forest cake?

19:47.880 --> 19:48.550
No.

19:48.960 --> 19:50.180
Is it almond jelly?

19:53.190 --> 19:53.710
Yes.

19:55.080 --> 19:56.430
Do you believe me now?

19:57.420 --> 19:58.250
Actually,

19:58.400 --> 20:00.030
In addition to telepathy,

20:00.030 --> 20:02.170
I have another mental strength.

20:02.550 --> 20:04.980
I can read your mind.

20:06.390 --> 20:07.320
Do you want to try it?

20:14.380 --> 20:15.260
I'm hungry.

20:15.280 --> 20:16.260
I want to eat.

20:17.880 --> 20:19.610
Didn't you have breakfast before coming?

20:19.630 --> 20:20.780
I want to eat more.

20:23.630 --> 20:25.060
Okay, I'll buy you something to eat.

20:25.930 --> 20:27.430
Stay here and be a good person.

20:39.850 --> 20:40.740
Do you want to continue?

20:44.840 --> 20:46.470
Actually you still want it

20:46.500 --> 20:48.330
Watch my telepathy.

20:51.720 --> 20:52.420
Actually,

20:52.420 --> 20:54.690
You don't want to eat it at all.

20:55.030 --> 20:56.500
You just made an excuse

20:56.500 --> 20:57.590
Let her go.

20:58.190 --> 20:59.280
you don't want her

20:59.300 --> 21:00.270
Listen to your thoughts.

21:08.710 --> 21:10.390
She takes good care of you.

21:11.080 --> 21:12.840
But does it also stress you out?

21:16.820 --> 21:17.710
but you are

21:17.710 --> 21:19.340
He is a very sensible child.

21:19.570 --> 21:21.580
Are you willing to understand your mother?

21:21.670 --> 21:22.430
correct?

21:23.310 --> 21:24.950
My mother used to be very busy at work.

21:25.580 --> 21:27.300
She barely had time for me.

21:27.860 --> 21:28.910
I don't blame her.

21:30.300 --> 21:32.890
But she actually wants to spend more time with you.

21:33.380 --> 21:35.390
That's why she took you to the hot spring hotel.

21:36.050 --> 21:36.890
but

21:37.330 --> 21:38.990
what happened that day

21:39.950 --> 21:41.550
Make you sad all the time.

21:41.880 --> 21:42.630
correct?

21:48.100 --> 21:48.790
Yuan.

21:49.050 --> 21:50.140
you are very brave.

21:51.280 --> 21:52.610
You did nothing wrong.

21:52.950 --> 21:54.500
You protected your mother.

21:56.970 --> 21:57.770
so...

21:58.370 --> 22:00.510
Is protecting mom the most important thing?

22:00.970 --> 22:01.940
certainly.

22:04.510 --> 22:05.580
You did cheat.

22:06.460 --> 22:07.170
I have no idea

22:07.200 --> 22:08.290
how did you do it,

22:08.400 --> 22:10.160
But you're not telepathic at all.

22:10.190 --> 22:11.950
You are here to cheat with him.

22:15.300 --> 22:16.170
Yuan.

22:19.060 --> 22:19.750
Yuan.

22:20.550 --> 22:21.850
Can you tell me

22:21.880 --> 22:23.140
What about this pocket watch?

22:25.650 --> 22:26.800
Yuan, what's wrong?

22:30.180 --> 22:31.400
Sorry, Miss Chen.

22:32.090 --> 22:32.790
Just now, he might...

22:32.810 --> 22:33.450
Yuan.

22:33.480 --> 22:34.700
We go home.

22:36.250 --> 22:37.060
Ms. Chen.

22:37.080 --> 22:37.600
let's go.

22:47.640 --> 22:50.030
Sorry, I can't be of much help.

22:50.540 --> 22:52.390
Your arrival is such a big help.

22:52.930 --> 22:55.510
I think Fang Yuan does have something to say.

22:55.640 --> 22:57.190
But maybe he has some concerns.

22:57.950 --> 22:59.120
On the contrary, I think

22:59.140 --> 23:01.700
Chen Xinhui's reaction was a little strange.

23:03.490 --> 23:05.460
Did your fingers touch him?

23:07.440 --> 23:08.320
what are you saying?

23:08.520 --> 23:09.910
The game you just played.

23:10.180 --> 23:11.590
Or maybe it's a physical cue.

23:13.930 --> 23:15.480
This is my partner Cheng Nuo.

23:15.940 --> 23:17.820
This is my junior An Qiu.

23:17.910 --> 23:19.260
She is a top student majoring in psychology.

23:19.340 --> 23:19.930
Hello.

23:19.950 --> 23:21.390
Or something you discussed

23:21.410 --> 23:22.340
before you go in.

23:22.370 --> 23:23.450
The answer is predetermined.

23:23.470 --> 23:24.970
Stop guessing. They are all wrong.

23:25.390 --> 23:25.830
Incorrect?

23:26.850 --> 23:27.570
So what is this?

23:27.870 --> 23:29.050
Didn't you see all this?

23:29.070 --> 23:30.300
Were you in the control room just now?

23:30.390 --> 23:31.440
You still don't understand?

23:31.460 --> 23:33.800
this is actually a game

23:33.820 --> 23:35.160
We play a lot in therapy.

23:35.390 --> 23:36.650
The principle is simple.

23:36.650 --> 23:37.700
Just make a mark? ? ?

23:37.700 --> 23:38.660
I knew it.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.380
You must have marked your answer.

23:40.410 --> 23:40.830
correct?

23:41.770 --> 23:43.190
of course not.

23:43.450 --> 23:44.850
The answer is always different.

23:45.110 --> 23:45.950
if this were not the case

23:46.930 --> 23:47.610
So where do you mark it?

23:48.680 --> 23:49.730
Think about it.

23:49.750 --> 23:50.960
I'll see her off.

23:50.990 --> 23:51.790
I have other things to do.

23:54.410 --> 23:55.760
What comes before the answer?

23:55.780 --> 23:57.400
Think about it.

24:03.710 --> 24:04.630
Still thinking about the answer?

24:06.720 --> 24:07.890
Do you really think I'm stupid?

24:08.490 --> 24:09.710
options before correct answer

24:09.730 --> 24:11.110
It's something black.

24:11.130 --> 24:12.960
This game is called Dark Magic, right?

24:15.290 --> 24:16.710
Are you doubting Chen Xinhui?

24:17.110 --> 24:18.080
[Chen Xinhui, Chairman of Yige Xinyuan Clothing Co., Ltd.]

24:17.110 --> 24:18.080
[Occupation: Entrepreneur]

24:17.310 --> 24:17.810
Yes.

24:18.570 --> 24:19.810
Do you remember the surveillance video?

24:20.200 --> 24:21.990
That crazy woman knocked on a lot of doors.

24:22.290 --> 24:23.970
Why is only Chen Xinhui opening the door?

24:24.010 --> 24:25.440
I do not think so

24:25.590 --> 24:26.800
they have no relationship

24:26.840 --> 24:27.800
As Chen Xinhui said.

24:28.100 --> 24:28.810
look.

24:29.220 --> 24:30.870
This is Chen Xinhui’s call record this year.

24:30.950 --> 24:32.170
In addition to Fang Yuan’s teachers,

24:32.190 --> 24:33.770
She had almost no contact with anyone else.

24:34.170 --> 24:34.990
perhaps

24:35.370 --> 24:36.150
She only focuses on

24:36.170 --> 24:37.370
On her children?

24:40.280 --> 24:40.800
look.

24:43.960 --> 24:46.090
So does she go out often?

24:46.930 --> 24:48.110
Does not match previous information.

24:48.130 --> 24:48.620
Indeed.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.090
Indeed, she goes out a lot.

24:50.540 --> 24:52.270
It's also true that she doesn't like leaving home.

24:52.850 --> 24:53.820
Chen Xinhui and husband

24:53.930 --> 24:55.690
Once ran a clothing trading company.

24:55.990 --> 24:57.510
After her husband died of illness,

24:57.530 --> 24:58.620
She is the only one who can manage it all.

24:58.650 --> 24:59.740
The profit is still quite good.

25:00.030 --> 25:01.120
However, three years ago,

25:01.150 --> 25:02.370
She suddenly sold the company.

25:02.390 --> 25:03.610
She never started a business again

25:03.640 --> 25:04.370
Or work from then on.

25:04.400 --> 25:05.290
She stayed at home.

25:05.530 --> 25:06.120
certainly,

25:06.140 --> 25:07.690
The money she earned before

25:07.720 --> 25:09.550
enough to meet their daily expenses.

25:10.120 --> 25:11.330
so,

25:12.010 --> 25:13.520
She suddenly changed her personality

25:13.980 --> 25:15.370
three years ago.

25:30.610 --> 25:31.580
Yuan.

25:32.170 --> 25:32.920
here.

25:33.300 --> 25:34.610
Would you like some fruit?

25:34.840 --> 25:35.230
here.

25:40.700 --> 25:43.120
Can I squeeze some juice for you?

25:53.420 --> 25:55.430
Have you been in contact with Chen Xinhui recently?

25:56.090 --> 25:58.400
Some time ago she suddenly asked me to borrow money.

25:58.480 --> 26:00.120
But I don't have that much money.

26:00.140 --> 26:01.420
She just gets mad at me.

26:01.540 --> 26:02.550
Miss Chen?

26:03.020 --> 26:04.050
She hasn't been here for a long time.

26:04.220 --> 26:04.810
in the past,

26:04.840 --> 26:06.740
She often comes here to have dinner with her colleagues.

26:06.840 --> 26:08.170
She hasn't finished speaking yet

26:08.200 --> 26:09.380
The wine she keeps here

26:09.400 --> 26:10.440
and the balance of the membership card.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.630
How long has it been since you last contacted Chen Xinhui?

26:12.940 --> 26:13.730
some years.

26:14.080 --> 26:15.300
So she didn't go back to your hometown

26:15.300 --> 26:16.180
When did your father die?

26:16.200 --> 26:17.290
No, she didn't.

26:17.760 --> 26:19.350
Please don't mention these things again, okay?

26:20.250 --> 26:21.050
They are all in the past.

26:21.070 --> 26:22.110
I heard from our friends

26:22.130 --> 26:23.260
she sold the company

26:23.290 --> 26:25.010
and scolded her partner.

26:25.030 --> 26:26.070
Did you visit her at her home?

26:26.240 --> 26:27.050
Yes.

26:27.300 --> 26:28.550
It seems like someone lives there,

26:29.320 --> 26:30.140
but

26:30.460 --> 26:31.730
She didn't open the door when I went there.

26:32.280 --> 26:33.580
We haven't been in contact since.

26:34.640 --> 26:36.310
In about three years,

26:36.470 --> 26:37.810
Not only did she sell the company;

26:38.120 --> 26:39.340
But it also fell out

26:39.370 --> 26:40.340
With all relatives and friends.

26:40.380 --> 26:42.510
She had various reasons for falling out with them.

26:43.630 --> 26:45.100
She borrowed money from a friend.

26:45.190 --> 26:46.340
This is understandable.

26:46.520 --> 26:47.690
But her brother said

26:47.850 --> 26:48.860
When her father died,

26:48.880 --> 26:50.090
She didn't even attend the funeral.

26:50.520 --> 26:52.040
This doesn't make sense.

26:53.220 --> 26:55.410
Maybe she has a secret that she doesn't want others to know.

26:56.390 --> 26:56.870
Cheng Nuo,

26:57.270 --> 26:59.040
This is the autopsy result that Director Wan asked me to give you.

27:03.060 --> 27:03.940
I knew it.

27:04.380 --> 27:05.110
What's this?

27:05.680 --> 27:07.150
This is the autopsy report of the deceased.

27:07.700 --> 27:08.320
come over.

27:08.840 --> 27:10.830
【Evaluation Report】

27:08.840 --> 27:10.830
[An autopsy showed that the spleen was ruptured and lost due to a stab wound to the abdomen? ? ? 】

27:08.840 --> 27:10.830
[Smoke residue was found in the lungs, indicating that a large amount of smoke was inhaled before death]

27:09.670 --> 27:11.050
According to the autopsy report,

27:11.230 --> 27:13.450
The deceased had been taking hallucinogenic drugs for a long time

27:11.450 --> 27:13.170
[Blood test showed that the deceased had been taking hallucinogenic drugs for a long time]

27:11.450 --> 27:13.170
[The deceased had symptoms of muscle atrophy and malnutrition]

27:13.780 --> 27:14.860
and suffering from malnutrition

27:15.070 --> 27:16.370
and muscle atrophy before death.

27:16.740 --> 27:17.920
She was most likely imprisoned.

27:19.800 --> 27:21.020
do you remember

27:21.020 --> 27:22.950
What did Ms. Wang at the hotel say?

27:22.950 --> 27:25.460
Then I heard a loud noise.

27:25.480 --> 27:27.120
She said she heard someone screaming

27:27.150 --> 27:28.090
“Let go of my child.

27:28.430 --> 27:29.730
Let go of my child! "

27:29.750 --> 27:30.760
If we take it literally,

27:30.790 --> 27:32.050
we subconsciously believe

27:32.190 --> 27:33.410
Chen Xinhui said so.

27:33.770 --> 27:34.990
But I listened carefully to the recording

27:35.390 --> 27:36.930
And found
that something was wrong with the tone.

27:40.570 --> 27:41.990
Let go of my child.

27:42.380 --> 27:43.980
Let go of my child!

27:44.920 --> 27:46.010
She emphasizes "my"

27:46.380 --> 27:47.260
Rather than "let go".

27:47.720 --> 27:48.720
So I think

27:48.940 --> 27:50.780
It should be the crazy woman who said this.

27:51.180 --> 27:52.530
This is the real Chen Xinhui.

27:55.680 --> 27:57.480
Well, it's clear now.

27:57.940 --> 27:58.830
signature.

28:03.410 --> 28:04.090
Cheng Nuo,

28:05.260 --> 28:06.300
we shouldn't

28:06.940 --> 28:09.130
Should I be more cautious before signing?

28:09.740 --> 28:11.090
Fang Yuan is still just a child.

28:11.730 --> 28:13.350
If we took away his only family

28:13.550 --> 28:15.440
I'm afraid he can't
bear such a huge blow.

28:15.620 --> 28:17.330
-And, Chen Xinhui...
-Are you speaking for humanoids?

28:22.040 --> 28:23.340
have you ever thought about

28:24.930 --> 28:27.070
What does this result mean to them?

28:27.100 --> 28:28.410
That's not what I should be thinking about.

28:28.500 --> 28:29.760
Neither do you.

28:30.060 --> 28:31.280
You just need to judge

28:31.310 --> 28:32.460
If the target is a humanoid. that's all.

28:43.050 --> 28:43.700
so,

28:44.460 --> 28:46.740
Is protecting mom the most important thing?

28:46.930 --> 28:47.740
certainly.

28:50.470 --> 28:51.660
You did cheat.

28:52.380 --> 28:53.150
I don't know how...

28:56.100 --> 28:58.200
Protect mom...

29:00.470 --> 29:01.520
[Is protecting mother the most important thing? 】

29:12.720 --> 29:13.900
Hello, senior.

29:15.050 --> 29:16.070
I want to leave the Xin Genome Institute.

29:17.550 --> 29:18.230
Why?

29:20.650 --> 29:21.850
You still remember my partner Cheng Nuo, right?

29:25.880 --> 29:27.480
The difference between humanoids and humans

29:28.320 --> 29:29.830
Just the initial obsession.

29:30.620 --> 29:32.440
It is the basis of all behavior

29:32.460 --> 29:33.810
and humanoid emotions.

29:34.340 --> 29:36.590
It's like an instinct.

29:37.890 --> 29:39.990
Sheen Genome Institute aims to work with police

29:40.010 --> 29:41.460
Identify and search for humanoids.

29:42.210 --> 29:44.350
But at the same time we also need to care for them.

29:44.770 --> 29:46.110
However, Cheng Nuo was different.

29:47.690 --> 29:48.970
he has been hostile

29:49.570 --> 29:51.230
Towards the humanoids.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.360
To identify humanoids,

29:53.540 --> 29:54.860
He is willing to do anything.

29:57.560 --> 29:58.860
But humanoids

30:00.190 --> 30:01.490
Not a robot.

30:02.350 --> 30:03.890
They look just like us.

30:04.350 --> 30:06.200
They could be any one of us.

30:07.370 --> 30:09.720
Every time I look for humanoids

30:10.440 --> 30:11.690
I met a group of people

30:12.170 --> 30:14.010
Who has an emotional connection to it.

30:14.840 --> 30:16.560
If the human form disappears

30:16.760 --> 30:18.690
Their lives will also change completely.

30:19.640 --> 30:21.120
we need to correct

30:21.140 --> 30:22.660
People's overreliance on humanoids.

30:23.480 --> 30:24.610
But this process

30:24.990 --> 30:26.420
Makes me feel stressed.

30:29.770 --> 30:30.610
sorry

30:31.230 --> 30:32.640
Let you listen to my complaints.

30:33.500 --> 30:34.330
It doesn't matter.

30:35.590 --> 30:36.470
Advanced.

30:37.350 --> 30:39.580
Whether we're investigators
or psychologists,

30:40.810 --> 30:43.000
The purpose of our work is to enable people

30:43.030 --> 30:44.290
accept the truth.

30:45.500 --> 30:46.990
Some people give up on themselves,

30:47.600 --> 30:49.280
But we can't give up on them.

30:49.980 --> 30:50.930
hold onto.

30:51.200 --> 30:52.790
Maybe a turnaround will come soon.

30:56.920 --> 30:57.720
Thanks.

30:59.350 --> 31:00.140
An Qiu,

31:00.970 --> 31:01.880
Actually,

31:02.450 --> 31:04.310
I think you are better suited for this job than me.

31:07.140 --> 31:07.740
wait.

31:10.080 --> 31:11.000
look at this.

31:12.930 --> 31:15.650
【Seasonal Recruitment】

31:13.120 --> 31:15.600
i saw it all

31:16.370 --> 31:17.370
When you are talking to Fang Yuan.

31:18.260 --> 31:19.600
If you work with Cheng Nuo,

31:20.430 --> 31:21.570
He might become different.

31:24.150 --> 31:24.760
Really?

31:25.860 --> 31:27.670
I thought there was nothing I could do to help.

31:28.270 --> 31:29.030
Incidentally,

31:29.440 --> 31:30.510
what is the end result

31:30.640 --> 31:31.500
What about Fang Yuan’s case?

31:31.810 --> 31:32.490
almost finished.

31:33.550 --> 31:35.230
We may have final confirmation tomorrow.

31:36.250 --> 31:37.930
Actually, I am still quite worried about Fang Yuan.

31:38.580 --> 31:39.970
Can I take a look tomorrow?

32:12.280 --> 32:12.950
Mr. Shen,

32:12.970 --> 32:13.890
A lady is looking for you outside.

32:13.930 --> 32:14.440
OK

32:17.510 --> 32:18.260
An Qiu.

32:20.100 --> 32:21.230
Why are the police here?

32:21.540 --> 32:22.670
Chen Xinhui is missing.

32:23.450 --> 32:24.260
what happened?

32:25.110 --> 32:26.120
Chen Xinhui

32:26.280 --> 32:27.230
Identified as humanoid.

32:35.560 --> 32:37.200
Where did that figure go?

32:37.340 --> 32:38.830
I've been asking you for almost 30 minutes.

32:38.900 --> 32:40.630
-You won't say anything, right?
-team leader.

32:40.760 --> 32:42.080
I found a secret door in the living room.

32:42.100 --> 32:43.040
Come and take a look.

32:43.270 --> 32:44.110
OK future.

32:44.130 --> 32:45.090
Take care of Fang Yuan for me.

32:45.120 --> 32:45.680
OK

33:11.210 --> 33:12.220
I knew it.

33:12.850 --> 33:13.610
Yuan.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.410
will be easier

33:15.430 --> 33:16.760
Tell us everything.

33:18.700 --> 33:19.860
Let me ask you one last time.

33:19.940 --> 33:21.010
Where is that figure?

33:21.370 --> 33:22.460
at this point,

33:22.510 --> 33:23.390
What are you still hiding?

33:23.410 --> 33:25.010
Could you please stop talking to children like this?

33:25.040 --> 33:26.200
Do you know what he did?

33:26.770 --> 33:28.120
That victim was his mother.

33:29.690 --> 33:31.360
We've done DNA testing

33:31.410 --> 33:32.340
For the deceased in the hot spring hotel,

33:32.370 --> 33:33.680
Him, and his mother.

33:33.700 --> 33:34.500
The results show

33:34.530 --> 33:36.460
The victim was also Chen Xinhui.

33:36.560 --> 33:38.540
One of them must be a humanoid.

33:46.070 --> 33:46.910
You won't tell, will you?

33:47.520 --> 33:49.120
Let me help you recall the process.

33:53.250 --> 33:54.090
I guess

33:54.600 --> 33:56.150
Your mother is too busy at work

33:56.490 --> 33:57.960
So she customized a human figure in Lao Cai

33:57.960 --> 33:59.300
Who looks exactly like her

33:59.300 --> 34:00.360
Take care of you for her.

34:01.030 --> 34:02.170
her first obsession

34:02.200 --> 34:03.860
It must be good for you

34:04.070 --> 34:05.080
and obey you unconditionally.

34:05.320 --> 34:06.570
stop.

34:08.070 --> 34:09.550
Your mother has high hopes for you

34:10.020 --> 34:11.510
This makes you feel stressed.

34:12.340 --> 34:13.639
That is a kind of love.

34:13.900 --> 34:14.989
But in human eyes,

34:15.060 --> 34:16.630
This is a disservice.

34:17.900 --> 34:19.199
Humanoids are no longer satisfied

34:19.219 --> 34:20.600
As a surrogate mother.

34:20.989 --> 34:22.040
She thought she was more qualified

34:22.060 --> 34:22.880
Become your mother.

34:22.900 --> 34:25.210
Teacher Yuan, I'm going to work.

34:25.500 --> 34:28.040
- Stay at home and listen to your aunt.
-But it's not easy

34:28.409 --> 34:30.040
to replace humans.

34:30.929 --> 34:31.630
first,

34:32.010 --> 34:33.060
This is just basic imitation.

34:33.090 --> 34:34.010
Yuan.

34:34.030 --> 34:35.670
I go to work.

34:35.760 --> 34:36.520
Yuan.

34:36.679 --> 34:37.500
Yuan.

34:37.900 --> 34:38.790
Yuan.

34:39.340 --> 34:40.810
I go to work.

34:41.250 --> 34:42.159
be a good person

34:42.590 --> 34:44.000
Listen to your aunt at home.

34:50.170 --> 34:50.860
Thanks.

34:51.969 --> 34:53.100
Humanoid placing drugs

34:53.130 --> 34:54.610
Get into food and water every day.

34:55.250 --> 34:56.010
Gradually,

34:56.370 --> 34:58.100
There is something wrong with your mother's health.

35:01.710 --> 35:02.810
at the same time,

35:03.150 --> 35:04.890
She started her plan to replace her.

35:04.920 --> 35:06.900
Ms. Chen, are you sure you
want to sell your company?

35:07.090 --> 35:08.980
In order to avoid being discovered by people familiar to Ms. Chen,

35:09.290 --> 35:10.540
She takes the initiative

35:10.720 --> 35:13.030
Identify
areas of discord between your mother and her family and friends

35:13.250 --> 35:14.700
Cut ties with everyone.

35:14.720 --> 35:16.180
Can you understand me?

35:16.210 --> 35:17.150
I'm in charge now.

35:17.320 --> 35:18.500
I can't go back.

35:22.140 --> 35:22.670
Yuan.

35:23.260 --> 35:24.940
I've fired that nanny.

35:25.340 --> 35:27.740
From now on I will take care of you wholeheartedly.

35:45.100 --> 35:47.410
Humanoids may be afraid to kill humans.

35:47.750 --> 35:48.850
So she kept your mother

35:48.890 --> 35:49.840
In the basement.

35:50.650 --> 35:51.740
Your mother was drugged

35:52.110 --> 35:54.790
So she is sometimes awake
and sometimes confused.

36:12.430 --> 36:13.000
able...

36:13.530 --> 36:15.750
Can I ask you a question?

36:18.030 --> 36:18.630
when? ? ?

36:21.140 --> 36:22.970
when i left,

36:24.890 --> 36:27.210
Is Fang Yuan okay?

36:28.750 --> 36:30.300
Is he happy?

36:30.920 --> 36:31.320
Did it? ? ?

36:32.000 --> 36:33.980
Does he miss his mother?

36:41.730 --> 36:43.160
I am his mother.

36:44.060 --> 36:45.660
He is happy now.

36:46.820 --> 36:49.300
I won't do anything to upset him.

36:52.330 --> 36:54.090
Drink it when you are stronger.

37:33.780 --> 37:35.330
On the day of the incident, there was a thunderstorm.

37:35.910 --> 37:36.920
basement door

37:37.240 --> 37:39.350
I opened it myself,

37:39.760 --> 37:40.770
The fault may be caused by a power outage.

38:16.330 --> 38:19.110
【Hot Spring Hotel】

38:31.040 --> 38:32.180
Have sweet dreams.

38:38.340 --> 38:39.940
Mom, what's wrong?

38:40.830 --> 38:42.300
It doesn't matter. Let me go and see.

38:48.780 --> 38:49.580
who is it?

39:03.550 --> 39:05.520
You took my child away. it was all your fault!

39:09.160 --> 39:09.870
Mother!

39:13.820 --> 39:15.290
Let go of my child.

39:15.690 --> 39:16.990
Let go of my child!

39:39.530 --> 39:40.690
Yuan, run!

39:55.870 --> 39:57.000
You didn't kill her, did you?

39:57.710 --> 39:59.500
This was done by humanoids.

40:02.380 --> 40:03.160
I do not understand

40:03.190 --> 40:05.160
Why do you still insist you did it.

40:05.590 --> 40:07.020
She has abandoned you

40:07.540 --> 40:08.460
But you still care about her.

40:08.490 --> 40:09.460
She won't abandon me.

40:09.700 --> 40:10.500
why not?

40:10.580 --> 40:11.600
The initial obsession?

40:11.990 --> 40:13.000
Are you so sure?

40:13.090 --> 40:14.750
Her first obsession was to take care of you?

40:15.220 --> 40:16.880
Maybe he is becoming another Chen Xinhui.

40:17.220 --> 40:18.140
that's why

40:18.170 --> 40:19.260
she got rid of real people

40:19.300 --> 40:20.320
and replaced her.

40:20.590 --> 40:21.210
And you

40:21.260 --> 40:23.740
- Just the tools she uses.
-nonsense!

40:23.740 --> 40:25.080
This was not planned.

40:25.080 --> 40:26.730
She didn't mean it.

40:26.750 --> 40:27.880
Then why did you lie?

40:27.920 --> 40:28.730
In the end what happened?

40:28.760 --> 40:29.430
Cheng Nuo.

40:34.580 --> 40:36.890
Yuan. Do not be afraid. Do not be sad.

40:38.060 --> 40:39.400
Only by knowing the truth

40:39.420 --> 40:40.720
How can we help you?

40:40.760 --> 40:42.390
can you tell us

40:42.800 --> 40:44.780
What happened that night?

40:53.370 --> 40:54.040
Yuan.

40:54.560 --> 40:55.610
What should we do?

40:56.660 --> 40:58.290
I did not do it on purpose.

41:00.440 --> 41:01.620
I don't know my mother

41:01.860 --> 41:03.250
who is with me

41:03.270 --> 41:04.830
Until that night, she was mother in human form.

41:40.220 --> 41:41.600
Sorry, Yuan.

41:42.050 --> 41:43.800
I am too busy.

41:44.100 --> 41:45.640
I don't have time to take care of you.

41:46.610 --> 41:48.730
Here's a little gift

41:48.750 --> 41:50.130
Congratulations on your win.

41:52.500 --> 41:54.700
I have lost my mother.

41:55.810 --> 41:58.190
I just don't want to lose another one.

42:06.360 --> 42:07.570
You asked me that day

42:08.070 --> 42:10.370
If protecting mom is the most important thing.

42:10.720 --> 42:12.470
You must be blaming yourself.

42:13.720 --> 42:15.060
But I'm right.

42:15.090 --> 42:16.520
Yuan, you are very brave.

42:17.200 --> 42:19.130
You just protected your other mother.

42:21.320 --> 42:22.600
Another mom?

42:24.420 --> 42:25.340
Having said that,

42:26.400 --> 42:27.740
She left when she was needed most.

42:32.580 --> 42:33.330
Yuan.

42:34.070 --> 42:36.180
She won't leave for no reason.

42:36.810 --> 42:38.630
You know what she went to do, right?

42:43.380 --> 42:45.370
Will Mom get legal status?

42:48.890 --> 42:49.550
What do you mean?

42:52.870 --> 42:54.090
she got a call

42:54.120 --> 42:55.260
Today comes from a stranger.

42:55.650 --> 42:56.610
he said he knew

42:56.610 --> 42:57.490
Our secret.

42:58.450 --> 43:00.170
He can help us.

43:01.050 --> 43:01.860
do you know

43:01.880 --> 43:02.990
Where do they meet?

43:06.840 --> 43:08.270
In Forest Park.

44:06.760 --> 44:07.680
let's break up.

44:12.190 --> 44:13.070
Chen Xinhui.

45:21.090 --> 45:22.100
stop! stop!

Advanced.

46:25.310 --> 46:26.500
Boy saves his mother

46:26.520 --> 46:27.740
There's a surprising twist.

46:26.740 --> 46:29.210
[Xiyuan City Breaking News]

46:27.910 --> 46:30.270
This ten-year-old boy relies too much on humanoids

46:30.410 --> 46:31.510
He hid it from the police

46:31.540 --> 46:33.750
The humanoid creature killed his mother for his crime.

46:42.430 --> 46:44.100
The patient has inhaled too much smoke,

46:44.120 --> 46:45.790
Causes cerebral hypoxia and ischemia.

46:45.810 --> 46:47.490
He remains in a coma.

46:47.750 --> 46:49.850
If the coma lasts too long

46:49.870 --> 46:51.950
He may have sequelae.

46:57.840 --> 46:58.930
Why don't you save him?

47:00.990 --> 47:02.200
if you hadn't run away

47:03.050 --> 47:04.480
He might not be lying here.

47:07.320 --> 47:08.120
I ran

47:08.600 --> 47:09.750
Catch the suspect.

47:09.770 --> 47:10.430
Really?

47:11.380 --> 47:12.750
Has the suspect been caught?

47:15.690 --> 47:16.730
for you,

47:17.250 --> 47:19.350
Catching the suspect is more important than saving people.

47:19.690 --> 47:20.570
correct?

47:21.060 --> 47:22.330
I believe Shen Li

47:23.500 --> 47:25.070
——will make the same choice.
-you are wrong.

47:26.230 --> 47:27.620
