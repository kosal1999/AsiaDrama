00:46.920 --> 00:48.320
Long time no see, An Qiu

00:50.240 --> 00:51.640
How do you know who I am?

00:56.120 --> 00:57.040
because

00:58.680 --> 01:00.280
I'm your partner

01:02.400 --> 01:03.320
What does it mean

01:03.920 --> 01:05.040
shanty town

01:07.200 --> 01:08.680
We were arrested together

01:10.000 --> 01:11.030
Run

01:11.030 --> 01:12.120
Bright-eyed people are here

01:12.640 --> 01:13.760
Don't move, let me go

01:17.030 --> 01:17.760
I'm waiting

01:33.030 --> 01:34.120
noon the day after tomorrow

01:34.400 --> 01:35.560
See you at the same place

01:37.400 --> 01:39.640
If you want to know all the answers

01:41.680 --> 01:42.400
chew

01:48.750 --> 01:49.470
morning

01:49.470 --> 01:50.120
What's wrong

02:33.560 --> 02:35.400
Why did you want to kill Qin Xinhui?

02:39.000 --> 02:39.840
exhibit

02:40.240 --> 02:42.280
Maybe Lu Yan led us in the wrong direction

02:42.440 --> 02:44.000
Yin Tianhong’s goal is not the laboratory

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
But the robot

02:45.520 --> 02:46.880
How else could Chen Xinhui explain it?

02:47.400 --> 02:48.960
It has nothing to do with the laboratory

02:49.120 --> 02:50.600
And Yin Tianhong doesn't know her either

02:50.880 --> 02:52.680
Maybe it was after Yin Tianhong saw the news

02:52.680 --> 02:54.280
Know that Chen Xinhui is a robot

02:54.280 --> 02:55.280
That's why I killed her

02:56.280 --> 02:57.560
Then after he killed someone

02:57.560 --> 02:58.600
Why were the bodies taken away?

02:58.600 --> 02:59.880
Arrange like your twin sign

02:59.880 --> 03:01.080
Simply perverted

03:02.080 --> 03:04.280
Every crime has its logic

03:04.280 --> 03:06.080
So the problem is we don't know the logic now

03:06.080 --> 03:07.280
That's why I'm stuck here

03:07.280 --> 03:08.240
This is because of Lu Yan

03:08.240 --> 03:10.680
We didn't get any professional resume reports at all.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.840
It only contains the identification information of the test subjects.

03:19.120 --> 03:20.000
what do you think

03:28.520 --> 03:29.400
do you know him?

03:29.560 --> 03:31.880
You will send the next batch of bots for testing

03:32.280 --> 03:33.120
What's up with him?

03:33.240 --> 03:34.160
We doubt

03:34.160 --> 03:35.160
All the robots are in the lab

03:35.160 --> 03:36.070
They were all killed by him

03:36.070 --> 03:37.800
Who is Yin Tianhong's employer?

03:37.880 --> 03:39.000
what kind of person is he

03:39.000 --> 03:40.440
What is primary mania?

03:40.800 --> 03:41.560
speak out

03:46.520 --> 03:48.360
Information about all robots in the lab

03:48.360 --> 03:49.280
give me everything

03:49.280 --> 03:50.560
Yes, I gave you everything.

03:50.560 --> 03:51.360
are you sure

03:52.560 --> 03:53.400
certainly

03:53.680 --> 03:54.400
let's go

04:06.960 --> 04:07.680
chew

04:10.240 --> 04:11.360
You're acting strange today

04:11.800 --> 04:13.240
When she had just deceived Lu Yan

04:13.360 --> 04:14.920
I've never seen you so fierce

04:16.560 --> 04:19.360
I just want to find Yin Tianhong quickly

04:21.390 --> 04:22.120
correct

04:22.680 --> 04:25.120
When did your mother start building the laboratory?

04:28.680 --> 04:30.600
Not long after Mingmu was established, she joined

04:31.040 --> 04:32.240
I've been very busy since then

04:32.800 --> 04:35.240
It seems I'm trying

04:41.360 --> 04:42.400
she said here

04:42.400 --> 04:44.040
That was at Dreamland Club

04:44.480 --> 04:45.600
dream club

04:45.920 --> 04:47.360
What on earth is this place?

04:49.240 --> 04:50.600
I remember before the subpoena was issued.

04:50.600 --> 04:51.800
The media has exposed

04:52.150 --> 04:54.280
Provided is an interesting android project

04:55.480 --> 04:57.360
Should we go there and check it out?

04:57.480 --> 04:59.040
Something must have happened there

05:27.920 --> 05:28.800
Who are you?

05:32.600 --> 05:33.480
Who are you

05:33.680 --> 05:34.800
I'm a temporary cleaner

05:35.040 --> 05:35.720
welcome

05:36.360 --> 05:38.240
We are sharp-eyed investigators

05:38.240 --> 05:40.120
Is this the Dreamland Club?

05:42.040 --> 05:43.560
We are investigating the case

05:43.600 --> 05:44.920
Can you take us there?

05:48.600 --> 05:49.360
he goes

05:51.720 --> 05:53.360
This has been closed for a long time

05:53.600 --> 05:54.680
what are you doing here?

05:56.840 --> 05:57.920
When I close this

05:57.920 --> 05:58.920
Will it always be empty?

05:59.720 --> 06:01.360
After what happened, they all ran away.

06:01.720 --> 06:02.800
No one cares anymore

06:04.480 --> 06:05.560
everyone ran away

06:06.360 --> 06:07.720
So who will take care of you?

06:11.400 --> 06:12.720
This is commissioned by the broker.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.720
Let me see you every few days

06:16.240 --> 06:17.840
As long as the house is good

06:32.720 --> 06:35.040
You just said something happened here

06:36.000 --> 06:37.560
What happened that year?

06:39.360 --> 06:41.360
Have you heard of Dreamland Club?

06:41.840 --> 06:42.600
we only know

06:42.600 --> 06:44.560
The following are the functions of Android system

06:44.840 --> 06:46.720
I'm not sure

06:48.240 --> 06:49.800
before issuing a subpoena

06:49.800 --> 06:50.920
The owner of this club

06:50.920 --> 06:52.800
Looking for a fleet of robot receptionists

06:52.920 --> 06:55.040
This is a regular club during the day

06:55.120 --> 06:55.920
Night comes

06:55.920 --> 06:58.150
So the receptionist was replaced by a robot.

06:58.240 --> 06:59.920
Android later became known as

06:59.920 --> 07:02.080
Android receptionists are becoming less common

07:02.280 --> 07:04.600
I didn't expect anyone to come here looking for updates.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.400
On the contrary, more and more

07:07.400 --> 07:09.600
What types of services are provided?

07:09.800 --> 07:10.920
how could I know

07:10.920 --> 07:12.160
I'm just a cleaner

07:18.680 --> 07:19.360
here

07:20.920 --> 07:23.240
A woman was stabbed more than a dozen times

07:24.000 --> 07:25.360
Bodies were dumped here.

07:26.160 --> 07:28.000
Is she also a guest at the club?

07:28.160 --> 07:28.920
What is contact information

07:29.360 --> 07:30.120
I have no idea

07:30.280 --> 07:31.600
You should ask the police about this.

07:33.240 --> 07:34.800
you know where people die

07:35.040 --> 07:36.400
I just don't know her identity

07:36.920 --> 07:38.560
What should be said and what should not be said

07:39.280 --> 07:40.920
you have a very clear mind

07:42.360 --> 07:43.150
Have you caught the murderer?

07:43.150 --> 07:44.040
No

07:44.240 --> 07:46.240
It was later discovered that the deceased was an android.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.800
The case is over

07:48.120 --> 07:49.150
Android

07:49.920 --> 07:50.680
Cheng Nu

07:55.600 --> 07:57.680
This should be your twins horoscope

07:57.680 --> 07:58.800
ritual murder

07:58.800 --> 08:00.560
maybe start from here

08:05.040 --> 08:07.720
But I always feel like something is missing

08:08.840 --> 08:10.160
something is missing

08:13.720 --> 08:14.560
cluster

08:30.600 --> 08:31.440
exhibit

08:48.880 --> 08:49.960
when the murder occurred

08:50.200 --> 08:51.480
Yin Tianhong should be there too

08:57.600 --> 08:59.200
This is the address Sister Qiao told you

08:59.200 --> 08:59.840
correct

09:00.960 --> 09:02.240
How does she know everything?

09:09.600 --> 09:10.320
That's it

09:17.120 --> 09:17.840
What's wrong

09:19.240 --> 09:21.000
Sister Gu sent photos of death at the scene

09:23.360 --> 09:25.120
The deceased in Dream Club was named Luo Su

09:26.000 --> 09:27.240
The murderer strangled her to death

09:27.240 --> 09:28.360
I have dozens of extra packages

09:28.880 --> 09:29.960
This is perverted

09:39.840 --> 09:40.840
Your name is Tang Min

09:42.720 --> 09:44.240
We are sharp-eyed investigators

09:44.440 --> 09:45.840
Dream Club a year ago

09:45.840 --> 09:47.120
The robot is dead

09:47.520 --> 09:49.840
Was it you who went to identify the body?

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Come and drink some water

09:53.000 --> 09:53.720
Thanks

09:55.600 --> 09:56.960
excuse me

09:56.960 --> 09:59.440
We are here to ask about Luosu.

10:01.360 --> 10:02.360
your house is beautiful

10:02.600 --> 10:03.440
It is said

10:03.720 --> 10:05.480
I've worked in clubs before.

10:07.120 --> 10:09.120
Yes, I used to work as a cashier there.

10:09.240 --> 10:11.840
I heard that you and Luo Su have a good relationship.

10:15.840 --> 10:18.520
Because these are the guests who come to the club to spend money

10:18.520 --> 10:21.000
He often bullies others just because he has money.

10:21.080 --> 10:23.120
It stops it for me every time

10:24.000 --> 10:26.080
Did you know this is Android?

10:27.360 --> 10:29.480
nightclub receptionist

10:29.480 --> 10:31.000
They are all Android

10:32.240 --> 10:34.440
Rossu is also a receptionist

10:34.440 --> 10:36.480
She was one of the first receptionists

10:36.520 --> 10:37.720
when i leave

10:37.720 --> 10:39.720
She has been working there for a long time

10:43.720 --> 10:44.960
you are in the club

10:45.000 --> 10:45.960
Have you met this person?

10:52.120 --> 10:53.600
He is also the receptionist

10:55.360 --> 10:57.480
What is his relationship with Luo Su?

10:59.000 --> 11:00.480
Both

11:00.840 --> 11:02.720
They shouldn't know each other, right?

11:02.840 --> 11:05.200
Russell was seriously ill at the time

11:05.200 --> 11:07.440
Then I left the club

11:07.720 --> 11:09.880
A few months later this guy came

11:10.000 --> 11:11.240
no intersection

11:11.360 --> 11:13.200
What kind of person is Yin Tianhong?

11:14.720 --> 11:16.000
this person

11:16.640 --> 11:18.440
I'm not very familiar with this.

11:18.440 --> 11:20.840
So why does he want to work at Dreamland Club?

11:23.480 --> 11:25.760
Why are you interested in it?

11:27.480 --> 11:29.240
We have been looking for Yin Tianhong

11:29.240 --> 11:30.360
But found almost nothing

11:30.360 --> 11:32.000
any useful information

11:32.200 --> 11:33.640
I felt a little anxious for a while

11:33.640 --> 11:34.520
excuse me

11:35.120 --> 11:35.960
I don't know either

11:35.960 --> 11:37.720
Why did he come to the club?

11:38.200 --> 11:40.760
Probably because after the subpoena was announced

11:40.840 --> 11:43.360
There are probably a lot of Android devices out there that don’t want to go back.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.600
The club is one of the few that can offer robots

11:45.600 --> 11:47.000
Provide a place to work

11:47.000 --> 11:49.120
You just said that Luo Su was sick

11:49.600 --> 11:51.120
she has lupus erythematosus

11:51.720 --> 11:53.120
this is very dangerous

11:53.480 --> 11:54.760
that's why she is

11:54.960 --> 11:56.360
Expelled from the club

11:57.000 --> 11:59.120
So how did she die in the club?

11:59.120 --> 12:00.720
I do not know why either

12:00.840 --> 12:02.240
you never doubted

12:02.480 --> 12:03.600
Who is the murderer?

12:03.840 --> 12:05.240
Of course I also have questions

12:05.600 --> 12:07.200
But people in the company

12:07.320 --> 12:09.720
I'm worried this will affect the company's work

12:09.720 --> 12:11.840
Then let's all shut up and stop talking.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.840
This matter is over.

12:14.720 --> 12:15.520
But not long after

12:15.520 --> 12:17.000
Clubs remain closed

12:17.840 --> 12:19.960
Since Luo Su was brought to Xiyuan

12:20.000 --> 12:21.360
things are not going well

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
to the end

12:23.360 --> 12:25.120
He died mysteriously

12:25.640 --> 12:27.600
I don't even know why he died.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.760
Yin Tianhong and Luo Su

12:33.000 --> 12:34.440
It's time to enter the Dreamland Club

12:34.440 --> 12:35.760
No intersection at all

12:36.320 --> 12:38.200
If Yin Tianhong kills her

12:38.360 --> 12:39.520
Why?

12:39.520 --> 12:41.240
Insufficient motive and insufficient evidence.

12:41.600 --> 12:42.240
Maybe Rossu

12:42.240 --> 12:44.480
When I returned to Dreamland Club, I met him by chance.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.320
If you only see him occasionally

12:46.440 --> 12:48.000
Why is he a killer?

12:49.360 --> 12:51.000
He stabbed him several times

12:51.320 --> 12:52.240
so you think

12:53.200 --> 12:54.240
He is not a killer

12:55.960 --> 12:57.120
I just want to

12:59.360 --> 13:01.840
Things may not be as simple as we think

13:03.480 --> 13:05.440
We were trapped in a shantytown together.

13:06.440 --> 13:08.240
If you want to know all the answers

13:08.720 --> 13:09.640
noon the day after tomorrow

13:09.960 --> 13:11.000
See you at the same place

13:58.080 --> 13:59.520
I know you will definitely come

14:20.000 --> 14:21.640
I'm not here for you today

14:22.880 --> 14:24.000
for truth

14:24.880 --> 14:26.080
those robots

14:26.720 --> 14:27.840
Did you kill him?

14:30.440 --> 14:31.200
Why

14:31.440 --> 14:32.360
save them

14:33.880 --> 14:36.120
Help them get rid of their major problems

14:36.120 --> 14:38.440
Stop making excuses for your deviations

14:39.120 --> 14:40.520
They don't need you to save them at all

14:40.520 --> 14:43.200
Because of her initial obsession, Qin Xinhui

14:43.240 --> 14:44.720
trying to displace buyers

14:44.720 --> 14:46.200
Even her son Fang Yuan

14:46.200 --> 14:47.520
He killed his mother with his own hands

14:47.520 --> 14:48.600
Do you think this is true?

14:48.600 --> 14:49.840
So you killed her

14:49.840 --> 14:50.640
I said that

14:51.720 --> 14:53.000
I save them

14:55.760 --> 14:57.320
After killing Li Yi

14:57.840 --> 14:59.720
I was originally going to leave Xiyuan City

15:01.000 --> 15:01.760
but i never thought about it

15:01.760 --> 15:03.360
I can see you in the hospital

15:04.600 --> 15:06.320
You will be our last hope

15:09.600 --> 15:10.600
Where is Luosu?

15:16.320 --> 15:17.360
That's what you do, isn't it?

15:20.240 --> 15:21.880
when i was thrown into the club

15:22.600 --> 15:24.120
It sucked all the blood out of me

15:26.320 --> 15:27.640
if you really kill me

15:28.360 --> 15:29.960
Why are you so harsh on her?

15:30.480 --> 15:31.840
Still need to make up a lot of cuts

15:35.080 --> 15:35.840
she

15:39.520 --> 15:41.480
the only person i ever loved

15:42.720 --> 15:43.520
I don't want that, I don't want that

15:43.520 --> 15:44.000
next person

15:44.000 --> 15:44.720
In no mood

15:45.000 --> 15:46.360
Come and park your car

15:46.360 --> 15:48.320
Robot trapped in shantytown

15:48.320 --> 15:50.360
All sent to Ming's headquarters

15:51.360 --> 15:52.600
but i don't know why

15:52.600 --> 15:53.480
we have a group of people

15:53.480 --> 15:55.200
He was secretly moved to another location

15:55.600 --> 15:57.720
Every day people are taken for interrogation

15:57.880 --> 15:59.240
suffer mental torture

15:59.840 --> 16:01.240
I am not immune

16:04.440 --> 16:06.000
They often put pressure on me

16:06.000 --> 16:08.360
Challenging the end result in different ways

16:08.360 --> 16:09.720
Can you stop asking?

16:09.760 --> 16:12.120
They tortured me mentally and physically

16:15.240 --> 16:17.640
Until one day I heard them talking

16:18.840 --> 16:20.520
Several test subjects have died recently

16:21.640 --> 16:23.760
So what's going on with Ming?

16:23.960 --> 16:25.960
The boss said not to worry, he would take care of it.

16:28.720 --> 16:29.880
She said her eyes were bright

16:29.880 --> 16:31.880
Let's trust humanity again

16:32.760 --> 16:35.000
In fact, they already have mites in them.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.360
Humans can never be trusted

16:48.000 --> 16:49.240
Why did you open the door?

16:50.960 --> 16:52.080
I've opened the door

16:52.080 --> 16:52.480
Everyone, run quickly

16:52.480 --> 16:55.760
One night my friend broke the door lock

16:56.240 --> 16:58.160
Then we have a chance to escape

17:25.240 --> 17:26.880
After escaping from the underground laboratory

17:27.760 --> 17:29.240
I've been hiding

17:31.080 --> 17:32.080
If this is the case

17:32.440 --> 17:34.480
He was the first person to help me

17:35.400 --> 17:37.560
It also made me feel the world for the first time

17:37.720 --> 17:38.800
Someone still cares about me

17:40.240 --> 17:41.720
You guessed my identity

17:42.720 --> 17:45.960
She told me she was a robot too

17:49.320 --> 17:50.200
Enter

17:54.040 --> 17:54.880
Sit anywhere

18:09.160 --> 18:10.560
What are you avoiding?

18:10.920 --> 18:12.440
My home is relatively simple

18:12.480 --> 18:14.160
But it's better than living abroad

18:14.440 --> 18:16.240
If you don't mind, just sleep on the sofa.

18:17.680 --> 18:18.440
speak out

18:19.240 --> 18:20.520
What do you want me to do for you?

18:21.240 --> 18:23.160
I ask you to help me wipe my face clean

18:28.280 --> 18:30.000
I spent this moment with you too

18:31.000 --> 18:33.480
If only someone had helped me.

19:17.440 --> 19:18.680
What medicine did you take this time?

19:19.200 --> 19:20.040
vitamins

19:22.520 --> 19:23.480
I'm hungry

19:24.200 --> 19:24.920
Have a meal

19:32.720 --> 19:33.760
if something happens

19:33.760 --> 19:34.920
you must tell me

19:36.200 --> 19:38.040
It's cold whether you eat it or not.

20:24.280 --> 20:25.080
Take medicine to the hospital

20:25.240 --> 20:26.560
Let's go to the hospital to get medicine

20:32.400 --> 20:33.040
Come

20:34.440 --> 20:35.480
come drink water

20:47.640 --> 20:48.960
lupus erythematosus

20:49.680 --> 20:50.880
incurable disease

20:51.760 --> 20:53.880
Going to the hospital is a waste of money

20:53.960 --> 20:56.440
i can find more jobs

20:58.240 --> 21:00.400
Now except Dreamland Club

21:00.520 --> 21:02.280
Who dares to work for us?

22:13.720 --> 22:16.160
Look, this idiot is still here.

22:16.880 --> 22:18.320
Still in love?

22:19.160 --> 22:20.880
Do you really think of yourself as a person?

22:21.560 --> 22:23.920
How long have you been waiting for me?

22:24.800 --> 22:26.400
this is a love

22:28.480 --> 22:29.400
and gifts

22:29.400 --> 22:30.200
give it back to me

22:30.560 --> 22:31.280
give it back to me

22:33.080 --> 22:33.720
oops

22:34.440 --> 22:36.520
Android devices can actually write love letters

22:40.720 --> 22:41.560
a love letter

22:43.760 --> 22:45.080
Thoughts for everyone

22:45.320 --> 22:46.040
Meow meow

22:49.480 --> 22:51.280
Received love letter for the first time

22:58.560 --> 22:59.880
Dear Sue

23:02.480 --> 23:04.240
Be serious, be serious

23:05.000 --> 23:06.920
You are the first person to be nice to me

23:07.520 --> 23:09.760
He was also the first person to enter my heart

23:10.160 --> 23:12.440
when i write this letter

23:14.560 --> 23:16.720
i fall deeply in love with you

23:17.440 --> 23:20.560
i can do anything for you

23:23.680 --> 23:25.000
very influential

23:28.680 --> 23:31.000
so you think

23:31.920 --> 23:33.720
my love for you is real

23:33.720 --> 23:34.480
tear well

23:34.720 --> 23:35.720
throw it in his face

23:36.920 --> 23:39.280
Do you really think we are in love?

23:39.680 --> 23:41.440
I'm just kidding you

23:41.440 --> 23:44.000
This is our little game in the land of dreams

23:45.520 --> 23:47.280
I'll let you go now

23:47.960 --> 23:49.440
Never go back to dreamland again

23:51.280 --> 23:52.880
Apparently we are all robots

23:54.080 --> 23:55.640
Why do you hurt me more?

23:55.640 --> 23:56.960
but they are of the same type

23:58.240 --> 23:59.320
i believe everything

23:59.720 --> 24:01.480
It’s all because of the initial obsession

24:01.960 --> 24:04.560
You know what my first obsession was?

24:05.320 --> 24:07.000
I was playing with the boys.

24:07.240 --> 24:09.280
I wouldn't change this

24:09.280 --> 24:11.560
I'm just tired of playing with you

24:11.880 --> 24:13.240
Do you still want to help me?

24:13.480 --> 24:14.920
Please help yourself

24:22.320 --> 24:23.240
roll

24:33.240 --> 24:35.040
Because of her initial obsession

24:35.040 --> 24:36.240
and kana

24:37.080 --> 24:38.040
Don't you think so?

24:38.640 --> 24:40.520
Robots are surrounded by primal obsessions

24:40.520 --> 24:41.680
twisted

24:42.720 --> 24:44.280
they will hurt others

24:44.680 --> 24:45.880
I can't be myself again

24:53.240 --> 24:55.520
I've given them a chance before

24:56.440 --> 24:59.080
But no one can break through his original obsession

24:59.960 --> 25:02.960
I can only save them

25:07.040 --> 25:07.880
I don't know Luo Su

25:07.880 --> 25:09.320
Did I really cheat on you?

25:10.440 --> 25:11.440
but kill it

25:13.000 --> 25:14.240
Unable to save

25:16.160 --> 25:17.400
I can't even save you

25:22.000 --> 25:23.160
An Qiu, do you know?

25:24.160 --> 25:25.760
You are still the same as before

25:26.200 --> 25:27.080
very happy

25:28.760 --> 25:30.240
at least i still remember

25:30.240 --> 25:32.160
The look in the eyes of the person who hurt me

25:33.320 --> 25:34.440
but you forgot

25:36.000 --> 25:36.960
What does it mean

25:37.400 --> 25:38.920
Do you still remember your brother Anyang?

25:41.240 --> 25:42.080
my brother

26:23.640 --> 26:24.640
Open

26:27.480 --> 26:28.880
I'm already in the shanty town

26:28.880 --> 26:30.240
I got to know you and Anyang

26:31.160 --> 26:32.960
At that time, your name was not An Qiu.

26:33.200 --> 26:34.240
and called Anqing

26:35.000 --> 26:35.920
until

26:36.960 --> 26:38.320
Run

26:39.280 --> 26:40.760
Someone with bright eyes is coming, hurry up

26:40.760 --> 26:43.000
You are an infertile couple

26:43.000 --> 26:43.760
by order

26:44.400 --> 26:47.000
What I care about most is loving my family

26:47.000 --> 26:47.720
Why do you want to arrest me?

26:47.720 --> 26:48.080
do not move

26:48.080 --> 26:49.080
After the subpoena is issued

26:49.080 --> 26:51.440
The couple left you

26:51.440 --> 26:53.080
So what can you love?

26:53.640 --> 26:55.000
All that's left is each other.

26:55.800 --> 26:57.280
But when that day comes

26:57.560 --> 26:59.880
you can't even do that anymore

27:05.480 --> 27:06.200
quickly

27:10.240 --> 27:10.960
sit

27:10.960 --> 27:11.480
sit

27:11.640 --> 27:12.320
I ask you to sit down

27:12.320 --> 27:13.000
sit

27:13.320 --> 27:14.000
Don't run

27:14.080 --> 27:15.640
Come on, run, run

27:16.880 --> 27:17.640
Where is my brother?

27:17.640 --> 27:18.480
Where is my brother?

27:31.480 --> 27:32.160
Kraft

27:33.160 --> 27:34.200
stop and be honest

27:38.040 --> 27:38.760
Big brother

27:39.680 --> 27:40.400
Big brother

27:40.680 --> 27:41.720
Big brother

27:42.240 --> 27:44.520
Brother, wake up

27:44.560 --> 27:46.000
look at me

27:46.240 --> 27:47.240
Big brother

27:47.880 --> 27:48.800
Big brother

27:52.320 --> 27:53.280
who is this

27:55.000 --> 27:56.320
who killed him

27:58.560 --> 27:59.400
Cheng Nu

28:10.080 --> 28:11.440
Why should I believe you?

28:11.440 --> 28:12.440
Is he hiding something from you?

28:12.440 --> 28:13.800
About raiding shantytowns

28:14.800 --> 28:15.480
chew

28:16.320 --> 28:17.960
It's okay if you don't believe me

28:18.280 --> 28:19.400
But have you ever thought about it?

28:20.040 --> 28:21.720
Why are your memories fading?

28:21.920 --> 28:23.240
Why did you come to Mingmu?

28:24.200 --> 28:25.480
you are a robot

28:25.520 --> 28:27.000
Do you know what to do now?

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
I can help you

28:35.560 --> 28:36.280
Shen Li

28:36.480 --> 28:37.720
How long have you known An Qiu?

28:38.000 --> 28:39.280
nearly half a year

28:39.320 --> 28:40.000
What's wrong

28:40.560 --> 28:42.240
You should graduate earlier than her, right?

28:42.680 --> 28:43.320
Yes

28:44.160 --> 28:45.280
How did you two meet?

28:45.680 --> 28:47.520
We met in a lecture at school

28:48.240 --> 28:49.560
Her professional performance is very good

28:50.440 --> 28:51.160
I originally planned to stay

28:51.160 --> 28:52.880
Psychological clinic training

28:53.320 --> 28:54.720
Then Mingmu came

28:54.720 --> 28:55.640
cooperation with you

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
Why do you ask this?

28:59.680 --> 29:01.400
It's okay, let's meet my partner

29:03.000 --> 29:04.240
What was the past like in school?

29:04.560 --> 29:05.560
Did I mention that to you?

29:05.960 --> 29:08.040
She only said her family was abroad

29:08.520 --> 29:09.880
have nothing to say

29:10.800 --> 29:12.880
What happened to An Qiu?

29:13.200 --> 29:14.720
Suddenly you care about her

29:16.000 --> 29:17.880
That's okay, I still have work to do.

30:30.000 --> 30:30.720
welcome

30:30.760 --> 30:31.760
Please contact me

30:31.760 --> 30:33.480
Owner WestX00120

30:34.000 --> 30:35.760
Ask him if he has a rear driving recorder

30:46.800 --> 30:47.480
Where are you

30:49.920 --> 30:50.720
at home

30:52.800 --> 30:53.760
That day in the hospital

30:55.200 --> 30:56.720
Have you really never met Yin Tianhong?

31:04.800 --> 31:05.520
No
