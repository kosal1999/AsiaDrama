00:29.200 --> 00:30.080
please sign this

00:44.560 --> 00:46.080
Is there anything wrong?

00:46.560 --> 00:47.640
Wait a moment

00:50.840 --> 00:53.640
If you don't sign it every morning, I will sign it quickly.

00:55.840 --> 00:56.640
I know

00:59.480 --> 01:00.320
Let's sign

02:50.070 --> 02:51.400
let's check on my grandson

02:57.840 --> 02:58.800
what happened?

02:59.000 --> 03:00.680
This is not Xu Yinian's situation.

03:01.400 --> 03:02.960
This is the surrender report we received.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.680
now my case is correct

03:05.000 --> 03:05.680
he

03:06.280 --> 03:07.120
Surrender

03:07.880 --> 03:09.120
port imitator

03:09.400 --> 03:10.400
Purchase false evidence.

03:10.560 --> 03:11.720
and handling obstruction cases.

03:12.120 --> 03:13.400
Bionic humans have been discovered

03:13.400 --> 03:14.960
The police should be responsible for arresting people.

03:15.240 --> 03:16.000
let him go

03:17.400 --> 03:18.880
This won't just follow the crowd

03:19.280 --> 03:21.520
We will first investigate cases related to biomimicry.

03:21.560 --> 03:22.600
handed over to the police again

03:23.600 --> 03:26.360
We're still hearing the news. Please leave.

03:31.120 --> 03:31.960
please

03:32.600 --> 03:33.440
give me 5 minutes

03:33.440 --> 03:34.360
I told him alone.

03:34.360 --> 03:35.440
please leave

03:37.070 --> 03:37.720
I ask you

03:37.720 --> 03:38.560
Cheng Nuo

03:38.720 --> 03:39.600
Would you sign this yourself?

03:39.600 --> 03:41.120
I sign voluntarily

03:41.560 --> 03:42.960
i don't care about you

03:43.120 --> 03:44.120
Cheng Nuo

03:44.280 --> 03:46.120
What did I say when you were investigating?

03:46.120 --> 03:47.560
How will the two of us investigate?

03:47.560 --> 03:48.600
now you

03:48.680 --> 03:50.000
The test report has been issued

03:50.070 --> 03:51.880
Will you solve this case with me?

03:51.960 --> 03:53.440
Please also report to Wanbu.

04:01.120 --> 04:02.000
3 minutes

04:13.920 --> 04:15.120
I know you came here for her.

04:16.120 --> 04:18.000
But she has passed biometric verification.

04:18.240 --> 04:19.920
I can't help her, and neither can you.

04:20.240 --> 04:21.800
No matter what you do it won't change

04:22.160 --> 04:23.040
don't change

04:26.400 --> 04:27.920
I know she's a copycat

04:28.840 --> 04:30.560
I knew her from the first time I met her.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.560
But what you can change is

04:35.120 --> 04:37.150
Take me there too

04:39.480 --> 04:41.240
Before we meet a thought

04:42.040 --> 04:43.150
I am alone

04:44.150 --> 04:45.480
Shells floating in the sea

04:46.150 --> 04:47.360
like

04:48.240 --> 04:49.600
I think I saved her

04:49.600 --> 04:52.360
But the truth is, she didn't save me.

04:53.040 --> 04:53.920
Now?

04:55.720 --> 04:57.040
kick her out

04:57.800 --> 04:59.560
So please take me there.

05:00.240 --> 05:01.680
if she goes somewhere

05:02.240 --> 05:03.360
where do i want to go

05:04.240 --> 05:06.120
I will always be with Yi Nian

05:06.160 --> 05:08.040
We are looking at bionic animals, not humans.

05:08.040 --> 05:08.920
Even if I'm locked up

05:08.920 --> 05:10.600
Do you know you can't be locked up together?

05:12.040 --> 05:13.040
violinist

05:13.280 --> 05:13.920
people

05:15.280 --> 05:17.480
You may not be able to tell them apart even with the naked eye.

05:18.400 --> 05:19.120
Cheng Nuo

05:19.160 --> 05:20.720
One more, please

05:21.120 --> 05:22.600
Judge me with her

05:24.040 --> 05:24.920
At least

05:26.680 --> 05:28.360
i will see her again

05:32.120 --> 05:33.400
I can't change anything anymore

05:33.840 --> 05:35.600
You need to fit into your future

05:35.600 --> 05:36.800
go see her

05:37.240 --> 05:38.120
Is it worth it?

05:38.120 --> 05:39.000
worth

05:47.920 --> 05:48.840
Arrive in 3 minutes

06:07.240 --> 06:08.040
Wait a moment

06:13.480 --> 06:14.480
I want to say something to her

06:20.800 --> 06:21.800
Sun Yao is here

06:34.560 --> 06:35.680
I can arrange to meet you

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
but please tell him

06:41.720 --> 06:42.720
gone

06:44.240 --> 06:45.120
Why

06:45.720 --> 06:47.280
Isn't it because of him that you came back?

06:48.040 --> 06:49.040
Sun Yao said

06:49.150 --> 06:50.400
You never rejected him

06:50.400 --> 06:51.560
You just want to make him happy

06:52.150 --> 06:53.600
Do you know Sun Yao works for you?

06:53.600 --> 06:54.920
how much have you done

06:55.360 --> 06:56.150
your imitation

06:56.150 --> 06:58.040
Maybe you are following your original obsession.

06:58.240 --> 06:59.560
what happens now

07:00.360 --> 07:01.240
If Sun Chun knew

07:01.480 --> 07:03.160
If you don't see him before leaving

07:03.800 --> 07:05.120
How sad he must be

07:08.240 --> 07:09.600
Sun Chun let me go

07:10.720 --> 07:12.160
but come back

07:13.840 --> 07:14.800
because i saw

07:14.800 --> 07:16.800
There are many people like you around him.

07:17.920 --> 07:19.720
because I

07:20.360 --> 07:22.160
punish him for his crime

07:23.920 --> 07:24.920
I know too

07:26.480 --> 07:28.400
I will definitely be sent back

07:29.240 --> 07:31.240
I think this is the last time

07:32.920 --> 07:34.120
On the other hand I don't want to see you

07:36.360 --> 07:38.280
But you still have a chance to meet.

07:39.150 --> 07:40.280
believe him

08:03.600 --> 08:04.600
I'm scared

08:04.680 --> 08:06.360
When I came, I met you again.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.800
can i see him again and be like this again

08:10.240 --> 08:11.920
I can't stand it anymore

09:02.520 --> 09:03.440
sorry.

09:05.000 --> 09:05.720
Thanks.

09:11.720 --> 09:13.480
I asked Zhou Chen to solve the case.

09:13.640 --> 09:14.720
this incident

09:14.720 --> 09:16.880
Of course this has nothing to do with Yin Tianhong.

09:30.960 --> 09:31.640
you

09:32.720 --> 09:34.000
Maybe I'm too persistent

09:34.880 --> 09:36.080
The result will be like this

09:39.360 --> 09:40.760
this is your role

09:41.840 --> 09:43.000
do not think too much

09:47.720 --> 09:48.600
Thanks

09:49.760 --> 09:51.480
thank you for your signature

09:52.840 --> 09:55.000
I know you don't want to sign either.

10:10.480 --> 10:11.240
wholeheartedly

10:15.520 --> 10:16.240
Cheng Nuo

10:16.640 --> 10:17.520
wholeheartedly

10:20.120 --> 10:22.120
you are talking

10:22.720 --> 10:24.600
Xu Niannian believes that he is a bionic person.

10:25.360 --> 10:26.640
deported

10:27.840 --> 10:29.240
we don't even know

10:29.360 --> 10:31.000
What happens to her next?

10:34.480 --> 10:35.120
No

10:36.840 --> 10:37.520
No

10:39.480 --> 10:40.360
Why

10:42.360 --> 10:43.000
Cheng Nuo

10:45.320 --> 10:47.240
She should have been able to live here.

10:47.240 --> 10:48.440
Is she guilty?

10:48.840 --> 10:50.600
Why did you corner her?

10:51.360 --> 10:52.360
Cheng Nuo

10:52.480 --> 10:54.320
Cheng Nuo’s story

11:03.360 --> 11:04.720
I always thought

11:04.720 --> 11:06.120
we are all the same person

11:07.480 --> 11:08.600
fear of loneliness

11:09.840 --> 11:11.840
I thought you would understand how I feel

11:13.360 --> 11:14.520
but i was wrong

11:16.000 --> 11:17.360
you are not a lonely person

11:22.200 --> 11:23.760
You are the outcasts

11:25.240 --> 11:27.120
your life

11:27.360 --> 11:29.720
I don't understand love

11:31.240 --> 11:32.440
until you die

11:32.440 --> 11:34.120
You don’t understand love either

11:34.240 --> 11:35.840
Why should we separate?

11:35.840 --> 11:38.000
Why didn't Cheng Nuo stop him?

11:38.000 --> 11:39.720
Even if it's the last chance to meet

11:39.720 --> 11:40.960
Won't you give it to me?

12:43.480 --> 12:46.320
I know you're not suitable for catching androids

12:46.720 --> 12:48.440
Impulsive easily

12:49.720 --> 12:52.120
But you are not a person who does not know what is right.

12:52.200 --> 12:54.600
I know you're having a hard time right now

12:54.760 --> 12:56.640
But it's not your fault

12:56.640 --> 12:58.640
you just finished your work

12:59.840 --> 13:01.000
If it weren't for the Zhou Dynasty, they would

13:01.000 --> 13:02.600
when i stare at it

13:02.880 --> 13:05.600
You may miss Xu Yinian.

13:06.360 --> 13:07.360
you think too much

13:08.000 --> 13:09.720
Isn’t it natural to investigate imitators?

13:10.200 --> 13:11.080
nothing is difficult

13:17.480 --> 13:19.240
Why do this?

13:19.520 --> 13:22.000
Why do I always lock myself away?

13:22.320 --> 13:24.000
after recent events

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
you have changed

13:25.000 --> 13:25.600
Result#Kekka#

13:29.840 --> 13:30.720
result

13:35.960 --> 13:37.640
In the end you are still the same as before

13:40.840 --> 13:42.480
I looked up violinists

13:43.120 --> 13:44.360
I wanted to show it to my mom.

13:44.360 --> 13:46.080
I was the one who needed her attention the most.

13:46.640 --> 13:47.840
but she died

13:48.960 --> 13:50.320
Do I still have the right to change?

13:57.240 --> 13:58.600
Is this why you ran away?

13:59.600 --> 14:01.600
You thought you were hiding your heart

14:02.200 --> 14:03.360
Do I have to face it?

14:07.360 --> 14:08.840
Do you think you know me well?

14:09.960 --> 14:11.080
if i tell you

14:11.080 --> 14:12.520
I killed an android.

14:13.080 --> 14:14.440
You want me to capture the bionics

14:14.440 --> 14:15.360
Are you sad?

14:16.440 --> 14:17.760
Who killed it?

14:18.080 --> 14:18.880
Cheng Nuo

14:21.600 --> 14:22.720
Who did you kill?

14:23.640 --> 14:25.200
the time and place it happened

14:25.200 --> 14:26.080
Is it important?

14:28.480 --> 14:29.520
I just think

14:29.880 --> 14:32.240
if you tell me everything

14:32.960 --> 14:34.640
might be easier

14:36.480 --> 14:37.720
I want to help you

14:40.760 --> 14:41.960
I don't need your help

15:01.640 --> 15:03.240
Welcome next time

15:03.240 --> 15:05.080
Our eyes have the most practical experience.

15:05.080 --> 15:06.720
Excellent investigator

15:06.720 --> 15:07.880
I will share the report with everyone.

15:12.480 --> 15:12.960
what happened

15:13.240 --> 15:14.000
OK

15:14.960 --> 15:16.480
The pressure is mine

15:26.720 --> 15:28.480
I can't say I'm a good investigator.

15:29.760 --> 15:31.840
I've had some incidents lately.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.600
I chose a few words to say.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.480
share with everyone

15:35.480 --> 15:36.720
everyone should know

15:37.440 --> 15:38.600
Bionic human body structure

15:38.960 --> 15:40.480
No different from us humans

15:40.880 --> 15:42.000
So just use your naked eyes

15:42.120 --> 15:43.240
indistinguishable

15:43.640 --> 15:46.080
It is our duty to catch them.

15:47.360 --> 15:49.840
For example, these incidents I encountered

16:14.600 --> 16:15.640
what happened?

16:16.840 --> 16:17.480
Cheng Nuo

16:36.720 --> 16:37.600
Cheng Nuo

16:37.880 --> 16:40.000
Mr. Gao is waiting at the front desk.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.720
Giving it to him is like giving it to me.

16:48.840 --> 16:49.760
give it to me

16:51.440 --> 16:52.480
This is that video

16:52.600 --> 16:53.760
oh i'm here

16:56.000 --> 16:56.840
It's Takasan.

16:57.000 --> 16:57.480
Yes

16:57.480 --> 16:58.280
I am Cheng Nuo

16:58.280 --> 16:59.240
This is the video I requested

16:59.240 --> 17:00.080
Hello

17:00.160 --> 17:00.960
What about video?

17:01.320 --> 17:03.440
Although he said he would give it to me, I already gave it to him.

17:04.560 --> 17:05.280
Thanks

17:20.240 --> 17:21.480
No one has seen this video.

17:21.480 --> 17:22.000
not any

17:22.000 --> 17:23.480
I got a call from the traffic police

17:23.480 --> 17:24.760
Then he took out his card and came over.

17:24.800 --> 17:27.040
Another option is automatic parking logging.

17:27.040 --> 17:29.200
I usually don't look at it unless it has scratches.

17:29.240 --> 17:30.040
Have you copied it?

17:30.240 --> 17:30.880
not any

17:30.880 --> 17:33.480
This is where the surveillance cameras are located directly inside

17:33.720 --> 17:36.800
That is, if we provide clues

17:36.800 --> 17:37.760
Is there a reward?

17:38.080 --> 17:40.280
Don't worry, I will apply for the fees.

18:34.640 --> 18:35.760
Are there any new clues?

18:36.080 --> 18:36.760
No.

18:37.920 --> 18:40.000
Was Yin Zhenghong in the hospital the day he escaped?

18:40.520 --> 18:41.200
that's right

18:41.320 --> 18:43.000
The two of us are also helping to catch him.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.080
Can I have a look?

18:48.280 --> 18:48.920
Understood

18:49.560 --> 18:50.280
take a look

18:52.680 --> 18:53.400
where are you going?

19:14.520 --> 19:15.440
What are you doing?

19:15.480 --> 19:16.280
let us wash our hands

19:17.720 --> 19:18.960
Are you burning your card?

19:19.280 --> 19:19.960
Caught in the machine

19:19.960 --> 19:21.040
are you kidding me?

19:21.240 --> 19:22.080
Who are you protecting?

19:23.200 --> 19:24.320
i want to know myself

19:26.720 --> 19:27.440
Cheng Nuo

19:28.960 --> 19:30.880
I think you can hide it by burning the memory card.

19:30.880 --> 19:31.440
Cheng Nuo

19:31.440 --> 19:34.040
I am currently looking for a manager to oversee your work.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.160
If you're hiding something, I'm sure I'll find it

19:48.040 --> 19:49.280
In the end what happened?

19:49.400 --> 19:50.240
you don't tell me

19:50.320 --> 19:51.200
I let them tell me

19:51.200 --> 19:52.000
they won't help you

19:52.720 --> 19:53.760
only i can help you

19:56.200 --> 19:57.240
what do you mean

19:57.320 --> 19:58.640
i know your identity

20:13.000 --> 20:14.160
What did Yun Tianhong tell you?

20:19.000 --> 20:20.280
he told me

20:22.000 --> 20:23.040
I'm the same as him

20:24.240 --> 20:25.160
Isn't there anything else?

20:25.160 --> 20:25.920
you?

20:26.960 --> 20:28.000
Isn't there anything else?

20:28.440 --> 20:30.760
I think he knew I was a liar.

20:32.200 --> 20:34.000
Why are you putting up a sign for me now?

20:35.880 --> 20:37.000
i want to catch you

20:39.520 --> 20:40.320
is that so

20:41.720 --> 20:43.080
You also have evidence

20:43.920 --> 20:45.200
It's not too late to catch it now

20:45.480 --> 20:46.320
I will take you to escape

20:47.720 --> 20:48.640
Why

20:49.480 --> 20:51.720
Your role might be to find bionics.

20:51.720 --> 20:52.680
you are different from them

20:52.680 --> 20:54.440
Every place is different, every place is different.

20:56.680 --> 20:57.760
You are a very important person to me

20:59.080 --> 21:00.680
Lost someone important

21:01.960 --> 21:02.800
don't lose it

21:04.400 --> 21:05.720
i want to protect you

21:08.240 --> 21:09.680
Zhou Chen must be looking for us.

21:10.520 --> 21:11.720
Quickly

21:12.640 --> 21:13.680
how far?

21:19.240 --> 21:20.080
Cheng Nuo

21:21.040 --> 21:22.040
Don't want to go

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
i want to be here

21:24.000 --> 21:25.720
Are you crazy or fake?

21:25.880 --> 21:27.200
There is only one result left here.

21:27.200 --> 21:28.720
Aren't you curious?

21:29.480 --> 21:30.520
Who am I?

21:31.480 --> 21:32.640
Why am I a copycat?

21:32.640 --> 21:34.240
But most importantly, I was able to stay in your eyes.

21:37.160 --> 21:38.280
do you know

21:39.000 --> 21:41.160
Unless I know I'm a dummy

21:42.720 --> 21:44.240
I don't remember anything

21:44.800 --> 21:46.560
All I know is that I have a brother.

21:46.760 --> 21:48.320
But I object to his memory

21:49.280 --> 21:50.720
everything is blurred

21:51.680 --> 21:53.960
I want to clarify all these things.

21:55.240 --> 21:56.560
if you can't find the answer

21:58.000 --> 21:59.200
I will not go

22:05.720 --> 22:06.720
what do you want to do?

22:08.200 --> 22:09.480
i want to go somewhere

22:10.920 --> 22:12.200
Would you please come with me?

22:35.720 --> 22:36.440
elder brother

22:46.280 --> 22:46.960
run away

22:55.920 --> 22:56.720
you

22:58.000 --> 22:59.080
Have you been here before?

23:00.920 --> 23:01.680
not any

23:02.160 --> 23:03.480
but someone told me

23:03.920 --> 23:05.160
me and my brother

23:06.520 --> 23:08.000
used to live here

23:08.520 --> 23:09.280
who

23:14.920 --> 23:16.040
Let's go in

23:38.800 --> 23:40.080
Run, An Qing

23:40.200 --> 23:41.000
come early

23:42.000 --> 23:42.520
hurry up!

23:42.520 --> 23:43.280
Yasuharu

23:43.280 --> 23:43.880
Quickly

23:43.880 --> 23:44.520
I won't make it in time

23:44.520 --> 23:45.480
rest assured

23:45.520 --> 23:46.200
elder brother

23:54.480 --> 23:55.160
freeze

23:55.160 --> 23:55.760
let go

23:55.760 --> 23:56.400
elder brother

23:56.640 --> 23:57.440
elder brother

23:57.520 --> 23:58.280
Yasuharu

24:05.560 --> 24:06.400
what happened

24:07.000 --> 24:08.080
Do you remember anything?

24:16.280 --> 24:17.760
No more bionics here.

24:21.800 --> 24:23.440
This is my home

24:27.160 --> 24:28.520
me and my brother

24:32.760 --> 24:33.640
us

24:33.880 --> 24:36.240
I'm hiding here during the investigation.

24:37.240 --> 24:39.480
I hid there then

24:40.520 --> 24:43.000
Ever since my brother hid me

24:43.200 --> 24:44.880
He even jumped out on purpose

24:47.960 --> 24:48.520
I have seen

24:49.480 --> 24:51.680
He was dragged away by investigators

24:56.960 --> 24:57.720
as you can see

24:58.480 --> 24:59.480
Is that investigator here?

25:03.400 --> 25:04.720
It's been many years

25:05.800 --> 25:06.880
It's normal if you can't remember

25:07.240 --> 25:08.240
let's continue.

25:08.480 --> 25:09.680
The people waiting for Miao Gan rushed in.

25:09.720 --> 25:10.760
we have no chance

25:17.480 --> 25:19.240
why did you lie

25:28.560 --> 25:29.720
Not yet

25:34.720 --> 25:36.200
Surveyed 2 years ago

25:37.320 --> 25:38.320
you are here

25:52.080 --> 25:53.480
After 3 months of research

25:53.480 --> 25:55.080
We finally locked in on Sai Yuan City

25:55.080 --> 25:57.800
A place where cottage thieves gather and hide.

25:58.160 --> 26:00.200
Some of them were involved in injury cases.

26:00.920 --> 26:02.200
This is a military camp town

26:02.960 --> 26:05.240
The location is remote and the surrounding environment is complex.

26:05.800 --> 26:07.240
This is history in our eyes

26:07.240 --> 26:08.560
biggest action

26:09.720 --> 26:11.720
I also hope this is my last scene.

26:12.280 --> 26:14.560
Many of these bionic animals have criminal records.

26:15.280 --> 26:17.640
Investigation focuses on personal safety

26:17.720 --> 26:18.560
their existence

26:18.560 --> 26:20.480
Damage the fundamental interests of the whole society

26:25.480 --> 26:26.240
Do you understand it

26:26.480 --> 26:27.560
Clear

26:28.720 --> 26:29.320
Cheng Nuo

26:31.520 --> 26:32.880
This time you will lead the way.

26:33.480 --> 26:34.040
Yes

26:34.040 --> 26:34.960
make it look good

26:36.040 --> 26:36.760
make out

26:54.040 --> 26:54.760
stop

26:55.560 --> 26:56.280
go

27:21.680 --> 27:22.080
lie

27:32.440 --> 27:33.160
come out

27:33.320 --> 27:33.760
what are you going to do

27:33.760 --> 27:34.400
come out

27:34.960 --> 27:36.000
Why did you arrest me?

28:09.400 --> 28:10.000
freeze

28:10.000 --> 28:10.960
let go

28:12.680 --> 28:13.400
go

28:13.960 --> 28:14.640
let go

28:22.440 --> 28:23.160
come out

28:24.720 --> 28:25.400
go

28:30.080 --> 28:30.880
sit down

28:35.720 --> 28:36.440
It was all my mother's fault back then.

28:37.560 --> 28:39.240
I'm very radical about androids.

28:40.160 --> 28:41.800
A lot happened during that time

28:42.160 --> 28:43.280
I'm like a devil

28:45.240 --> 28:46.280
I do not want to say

28:47.000 --> 28:47.920
so i tell you i

28:47.920 --> 28:48.960
what happened

28:50.920 --> 28:53.160
what happened

28:59.320 --> 29:00.200
An Qiu

29:00.480 --> 29:01.480
Do not touch.

29:04.720 --> 29:06.040
Such a long time

29:06.440 --> 29:08.480
You're doing all the things you don't want to do.

29:08.480 --> 29:09.720
just exposed

29:10.280 --> 29:11.000
is that so

29:12.720 --> 29:15.480
You may also want to know the truth about your mother.

29:16.480 --> 29:17.800
if i knew

29:18.240 --> 29:20.280
I will never see your pain

29:20.280 --> 29:21.080
An Qiu

29:23.320 --> 29:24.760
only one answer

29:26.120 --> 29:27.520
The person you killed

29:28.720 --> 29:30.000
Is it my brother?

29:33.440 --> 29:34.160
Yes

29:52.720 --> 29:53.480
An Qing is

29:54.640 --> 29:55.480
An Qing is

29:56.680 --> 29:58.240
Kang Qing, Kang Qing, have you seen it?

29:58.560 --> 29:59.960
Talk to me Jingchun

30:02.160 --> 30:02.880
Mr. Shiro

30:04.280 --> 30:05.000
Mr. Shiro

30:05.200 --> 30:05.880
Mr. Shiro

30:06.000 --> 30:06.720
Mr. Shiro

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
joseki

30:08.160 --> 30:10.000
I haven't been here for a long time

30:10.000 --> 30:11.480
Someone was injured and stopped.

30:11.680 --> 30:13.080
Someone is sitting injured

30:13.720 --> 30:15.440
Someone was injured and stopped.

30:16.640 --> 30:17.640
Please be quiet

30:17.640 --> 30:18.720
Blood flows out from behind

30:19.480 --> 30:20.800
Go back and sit down to park.

30:20.800 --> 30:21.720
please sit down

30:21.720 --> 30:22.640
There are people injured

30:22.640 --> 30:23.280
Sit now

30:23.280 --> 30:24.480
Please call your car to go to the hospital.

30:29.880 --> 30:30.960
do it quickly

30:31.480 --> 30:32.640
jump off

30:34.240 --> 30:36.320
Third brother must not hit Mr. Bai.

30:39.440 --> 30:40.920
Mr. Shiro

30:49.520 --> 30:50.240
Mr. Shiro

30:55.920 --> 30:57.080
take it outside

30:57.080 --> 30:58.280
Please let us out, Mr. White.

31:01.000 --> 31:01.800
stop

31:09.000 --> 31:09.760
stop

31:09.960 --> 31:10.560
let it go

32:13.720 --> 32:14.720
investigation

32:15.560 --> 32:17.400
Only one android died.

32:18.320 --> 32:19.320
I did it

32:22.440 --> 32:24.160
But I didn't know I was your brother.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.480
I don't ask for your forgiveness either

32:27.080 --> 32:28.720
but please give me a chance

32:29.080 --> 32:30.440
I really want to help you and escape

32:30.640 --> 32:31.920
I want to hide my identity

32:32.320 --> 32:33.560
when the errand is done

32:35.240 --> 32:36.800
How can I take revenge?

32:43.640 --> 32:44.480
Think back

32:52.000 --> 32:53.480
he is right

32:54.760 --> 32:55.520
Cheng Nuo

32:59.560 --> 33:00.560
haven't seen you for a long time

33:01.400 --> 33:02.760
We finally meet again
