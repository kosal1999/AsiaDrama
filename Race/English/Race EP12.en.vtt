00:37.537 --> 00:41.041
Workplace Competition Code

00:41.124 --> 00:43.918
(The characters, events, groups, organizations
and backgrounds of this drama are purely fictitious. We hereby inform you that)

00:44.669 --> 00:45.837
-fine
thanks

00:45.920 --> 00:48.256
Let’s give today’s protagonist first

00:48.757 --> 00:51.718
-Congratulations on the promotion!
-Congratulations!

00:51.801 --> 00:52.719
senior

00:52.802 --> 00:54.554
-Congratulations
-Hey, what is this?

00:54.637 --> 00:56.389
- Oh my god
- open it! Come and drink

00:56.473 --> 00:58.391
(Does having money mean success?)

00:58.475 --> 01:00.268
(You can get there quickly if you have a car)

01:00.351 --> 01:01.644
-(Shut up!)
-(Shut up!)

01:01.728 --> 01:04.439
- (Hey, shut up!)
-Great!

01:46.064 --> 01:47.232
me

01:48.733 --> 01:51.986
The reason why I can still stay in this company till now

01:54.447 --> 01:55.448
It depends on loyalty

01:58.409 --> 02:03.289
I will never do anything that harms the organization or my colleagues

02:05.208 --> 02:06.918
Maybe you will be disappointed after hearing this

02:09.087 --> 02:10.338
But that's who I am

02:25.770 --> 02:26.896
Hello? What's wrong?

02:27.063 --> 02:28.690
Where are you? Won't you help me celebrate?

02:29.274 --> 02:31.234
Aren't you with your contemporaries?

02:31.317 --> 02:32.443
They'll talk about it later

02:32.944 --> 02:33.987
Where are you?

02:34.070 --> 02:35.613
See you in Utopia then?

02:48.543 --> 02:49.794
-Hey, she's here
- huh?

02:53.047 --> 02:54.632
- hello
- come in

03:02.140 --> 03:03.183
Xiao En

03:04.267 --> 03:05.143
Hello

03:07.437 --> 03:09.022
Congratulations, Section Chief Liu

03:11.274 --> 03:13.026
-Thank you
-Yun Zhao told me on the way here

03:13.109 --> 03:14.319
You are classmates

03:14.402 --> 03:15.612
I really didn't know before

03:17.530 --> 03:18.364
right

03:18.448 --> 03:21.701
I originally made an appointment with Dong Xun to meet
, but you want me to help you celebrate

03:21.784 --> 03:24.287
So we came together, okay?

03:25.163 --> 03:26.080
Masaaki

03:26.164 --> 03:27.040
good

03:27.874 --> 03:29.167
Yun Zhao, are you hungry?

03:29.584 --> 03:30.793
Want to order takeout?

03:31.586 --> 03:32.670
Xiao En, what do you want to eat?

03:32.754 --> 03:35.131
-Pig's feet?
-Okay, add more round soba noodles

03:35.215 --> 03:36.799
-well
_

03:37.800 --> 03:38.801
Let me see

03:44.641 --> 03:46.392
You seem to come here very often

03:47.352 --> 03:50.104
Not very often, I've only been here a few times

03:50.271 --> 03:53.107
Yun Zhao, have you ever eaten at this restaurant with high ratings?

03:53.191 --> 03:55.735
This one is not as delicious as expected

03:56.194 --> 03:58.404
So we usually eat here

03:58.488 --> 03:59.989
This one is really delicious

04:00.073 --> 04:01.115
(Utopia)

04:01.199 --> 04:02.951
Se Yong’s communications headquarters?

04:03.034 --> 04:05.161
Including PR, marketing and strategy rooms

04:05.787 --> 04:08.206
-Director Goo Yi-jung is really awesome
-Yes.

04:08.289 --> 04:10.250
Yunzhao, did you say you were in a communication group?

04:10.333 --> 04:11.376
right

04:11.459 --> 04:13.002
The pool leader is the leader of a group

04:13.753 --> 04:16.172
It seems they want to push the digital department

04:16.256 --> 04:18.174
This part will become more and more important in the future

04:19.133 --> 04:22.345
Spreading a group will also manage
the sustainability of the business, right?

04:22.428 --> 04:23.429
right

04:24.013 --> 04:26.307
That’s why the number of people in the strategy room will increase.

04:26.391 --> 04:29.769
Then you might be
the head of the corporate sustainability department

04:30.395 --> 04:32.772
I don't understand those

04:32.855 --> 04:33.690
how come?

04:34.232 --> 04:37.360
Didn't you make social contributions when you were in a group before ?

04:37.443 --> 04:39.279
That's corporate sustainability

04:39.362 --> 04:41.155
I just read some information

04:42.949 --> 04:44.784
How was Yun Zhao when he was a child?

04:44.867 --> 04:47.412
I heard that she transferred to Seoul when she was in fifth grade.

04:50.498 --> 04:53.042
If you're asking about first impressions...

05:00.591 --> 05:02.552
-Hey, where do you want to go?
-Hello!

05:02.635 --> 05:03.678
-Let him go!
-What?

05:04.429 --> 05:05.888
Hello!

05:10.685 --> 05:12.020
You stinky...

05:12.103 --> 05:13.980
Yoon So is a hero to me

05:18.192 --> 05:19.152
do not Cry

05:20.028 --> 05:22.322
The first person to wipe my tears

05:22.864 --> 05:24.073
It’s also Yun Zhao

05:25.658 --> 05:28.077
Hey, how could that be me?

05:28.161 --> 05:31.789
The first person to wipe your tears
should be your mother or your father.

05:31.873 --> 05:33.291
It's you in my memory

05:36.836 --> 05:37.920
Why do you cry?

05:40.381 --> 05:42.675
My father used to participate in the labor movement

05:43.176 --> 05:44.761
But when I was a kid, I didn’t understand

05:45.553 --> 05:48.431
Later he was imprisoned

05:49.223 --> 05:50.641
The kids in the neighborhood bullied me

05:51.392 --> 05:54.103
Yun Zhao helped me beat away those children.

05:58.441 --> 05:59.400
in retrospect

06:00.985 --> 06:03.821
Whenever I'm sad, Yun Zhao is always by my side

06:08.076 --> 06:09.243
in high school

06:09.827 --> 06:11.829
My parents are divorced

06:13.539 --> 06:15.124
i miss my dad very much

06:16.292 --> 06:19.045
He was still in prison at the time

06:20.880 --> 06:21.798
I'm scared

06:23.049 --> 06:24.175
At that time

06:24.801 --> 06:27.136
It was Yun Zhao who gave me courage

06:30.390 --> 06:34.644
Even when I break up with someone and feel sad

06:35.311 --> 06:36.145
Even then

06:37.480 --> 06:38.731
She is also by my side

06:42.151 --> 06:44.362
Sorry, Yun Zhao

06:50.243 --> 06:51.369
I really...

06:53.454 --> 06:54.705
I'm sorry for you

06:56.457 --> 06:57.375
thank you too

07:07.343 --> 07:09.929
Well, do we want to have a toast?

07:13.141 --> 07:16.394
Sorry, I think I have to go first

07:17.728 --> 07:19.188
Sorry, I'm leaving first

07:19.730 --> 07:20.606
But…

07:21.524 --> 07:22.400
Excuse me

07:27.613 --> 07:29.282
Masaaki

07:30.074 --> 07:31.159
Masaaki

07:36.581 --> 07:37.582
How are you?

07:38.624 --> 07:39.584
not good

08:40.311 --> 08:41.562
Did you hear that?

08:42.146 --> 08:44.607
Team leader Cui finally applied for voluntary retirement

08:46.817 --> 08:49.070
Agent Kim also took a leave of absence.

08:49.987 --> 08:51.531
I wonder if he will come back

08:52.198 --> 08:53.908
I guess he won't come back

08:54.742 --> 08:55.618
Brother Zhejun!

08:56.118 --> 08:57.370
How is this?

08:57.453 --> 09:01.165
What are you doing? How long has this been going on?
It must have been a week, right?

09:01.249 --> 09:03.292
I thought you were kidnapped and ripped off.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.169
Then you should call the police

09:05.419 --> 09:06.712
Why is everyone so immobile?

09:07.463 --> 09:09.090
Everyone is always like this

09:09.173 --> 09:10.883
One week after the promotion results were announced

09:10.967 --> 09:12.593
Everyone will go through a period of hesitation.

09:12.718 --> 09:15.763
So have you calmed down?

09:16.264 --> 09:17.390
Calm mood?

09:18.849 --> 09:19.850
I'm completely calmed down

09:22.019 --> 09:24.939
Because today is my last day on earth

09:25.606 --> 09:26.607
What?

09:26.857 --> 09:27.858
What?

09:28.985 --> 09:30.152
these days

09:31.529 --> 09:32.530
i had a great time

09:33.573 --> 09:35.199
(Meng Zhejun)

09:41.289 --> 09:42.832
What are you doing? Are you kidding me?

09:42.915 --> 09:44.750
-No
-Brother Zhejun!

09:45.084 --> 09:48.254
I was not promoted to deputy chief.

09:49.046 --> 09:49.880
fine

09:50.590 --> 09:51.757
I can bear it

09:52.341 --> 09:54.969
The problem is the pool leader

09:55.052 --> 09:58.431
I can't stay in a group where I'm the group leader at the same time

09:58.514 --> 10:00.182
Or should you ask for a group change?

10:00.266 --> 10:01.642
That's so useless

10:01.726 --> 10:03.936
Have you found a new job?

10:04.020 --> 10:07.898
Is there even a place where I can go in the public relations industry in the Republic of Korea ?

10:07.982 --> 10:09.734
I've worked for a big company

10:09.817 --> 10:10.818
I'm very popular

10:13.946 --> 10:14.947
correct

10:15.406 --> 10:16.657
I haven't congratulated you yet

10:16.741 --> 10:18.367
Congratulations on your promotion

10:19.327 --> 10:20.328
Section Chief Liu

10:25.458 --> 10:26.626
Then buy me a drink

10:26.792 --> 10:28.711
me? Why do I want a treat?

10:28.794 --> 10:29.962
Hey, why do I want a treat?

10:31.130 --> 10:32.089
Why?

10:44.393 --> 10:45.353
so cold

10:48.356 --> 10:49.565
Did you quarrel again?

10:50.316 --> 10:52.652
Stop arguing. Are you elementary school students?

10:52.735 --> 10:55.196
Always quarreling without talking, really

10:55.780 --> 10:58.074
This is a preference survey we conducted over the past 15 days

10:58.157 --> 10:59.533
As you can see

10:59.659 --> 11:02.578
The blue distribution map represents people in their teens to 20s

11:02.662 --> 11:03.537
right

11:03.621 --> 11:05.831
I have asked the manufacturer for statistical information...

11:05.915 --> 11:07.208
Scan up

11:07.708 --> 11:10.670
I think it should be separated
so that we can see clearly at a glance

11:10.753 --> 11:13.339
Yes, that part needs

11:13.422 --> 11:15.508
Organize based on information and understanding

11:16.467 --> 11:17.343
Come

11:17.968 --> 11:19.637
have a cup of tea

11:26.560 --> 11:30.272
Are you getting too involved in your work?

11:32.441 --> 11:33.526
I have to put in the work

11:42.785 --> 11:43.786
that…

11:44.620 --> 11:45.996
Do you want to go have a drink?

11:47.373 --> 11:48.290
senior

11:48.374 --> 11:49.375
Um

11:49.792 --> 11:52.169
When I feel like my heart is drifting away

11:53.295 --> 11:54.588
What should we do?

11:56.090 --> 11:57.174
Do you mean Yun Zhao?

11:57.425 --> 11:59.677
You don’t like Yun Zhao now?

12:01.178 --> 12:02.930
It’s not me, it’s Yun Zhao

12:04.348 --> 12:07.226
We have rarely contacted each other recently and haven’t seen each other for a long time.

12:11.647 --> 12:12.732
Just ask her

12:13.190 --> 12:14.692
Ask her why she is like this

12:14.775 --> 12:16.485
How do you feel about her?

12:17.069 --> 12:18.195
To be honest I'm scared

12:19.155 --> 12:20.823
what i'm worried about

12:22.116 --> 12:23.284
will become a fact

12:25.161 --> 12:26.829
Is your relationship still awkward?

12:26.912 --> 12:28.372
Yes, very embarrassing

12:28.456 --> 12:30.124
What about you and your boyfriend?

12:30.207 --> 12:31.208
I'm also very embarrassed with him

12:32.460 --> 12:34.420
You two have so many problems

12:34.712 --> 12:35.588
Xiaomin is just

12:35.671 --> 12:39.383
I told me thank you and sorry.
I don’t know why I behave like this.

12:39.467 --> 12:40.509
How could you not know?

12:40.593 --> 12:42.595
Say it like you know it

12:42.678 --> 12:45.181
Because you fell in love with Liu Jae-min in front of Seo Dong-hun

12:45.264 --> 12:46.140
Do you feel scared?

12:46.223 --> 12:48.184
Don't talk nonsense

12:48.559 --> 12:50.060
He likes someone else

12:50.144 --> 12:52.605
Didn't you two
talk about those things when you were stuck together all day?

12:52.688 --> 12:54.815
He confessed his love a long time ago and was rejected

12:54.899 --> 12:56.108
-What?
-Hello

12:56.192 --> 12:57.860
It's been so long, I've forgotten

12:57.943 --> 12:58.861
Really?

12:59.779 --> 13:02.656
(Cheongdam Tutorial Club)

13:25.304 --> 13:26.597
You have worked hard

13:39.693 --> 13:40.945
Yu Zhen

14:00.756 --> 14:01.590
Yu Zhen

14:01.674 --> 14:02.675
Are you a stalker?

14:02.758 --> 14:05.803
You've been here for several days.
How long are you going to be like this?

14:05.886 --> 14:07.429
Because I sent a message and you didn’t reply

14:07.513 --> 14:08.931
I blocked you

14:10.474 --> 14:13.018
That means I have nothing to say to you

14:14.812 --> 14:19.233
So if you keep coming to me,
I will really call the police.

14:21.735 --> 14:22.820
Yu Zhen

14:27.491 --> 14:29.243
Can you give me another chance?

14:29.326 --> 14:30.160
cannot

14:30.870 --> 14:32.580
I won't give you that chance

14:42.131 --> 14:44.466
Okay, thank you

14:48.012 --> 14:50.723
Hey, eat quickly, eat quickly

14:54.977 --> 14:55.811
(Yi Zhen)

14:55.895 --> 14:57.062
It's Yi Jung

14:59.398 --> 15:00.316
Hello? Yi Zhen

15:03.027 --> 15:04.570
Well, I know where that is

15:15.873 --> 15:19.293
Hey, why are you so tired?

15:19.376 --> 15:21.170
Can't even drive?

15:21.253 --> 15:22.671
What happened?

15:23.505 --> 15:25.716
Please let me get off in front

15:25.799 --> 15:26.634
Why?

15:27.259 --> 15:28.719
You two, let’s talk.

15:28.802 --> 15:31.221
But I made an appointment with you first

15:31.805 --> 15:33.849
Aren't you going to have a drink?

15:34.266 --> 15:35.267
Um?

15:35.351 --> 15:36.185
right

15:36.268 --> 15:39.021
Let me join in, I want to drink

15:43.192 --> 15:44.902
Is that the one?

15:45.527 --> 15:47.529
The one who shook your relationship with Xiaomin

15:48.030 --> 15:49.114
Really capable

15:49.531 --> 15:50.699
Without further ado

15:50.824 --> 15:53.243
Order some high-end dishes to go with your drink.

15:53.327 --> 15:54.828
What does it mean to be advanced?

15:54.912 --> 15:55.955
I have no idea

15:56.038 --> 15:57.706
Anyway, it’s just a bit more expensive.

16:03.921 --> 16:06.715
Hey, forget it, stop doing this

16:06.799 --> 16:08.217
You are her mother, not a sinner

16:08.300 --> 16:09.343
you have done enough

16:10.594 --> 16:11.428
But…

16:11.512 --> 16:13.764
She said she would call the police if you go there again.

16:15.891 --> 16:18.435
Kids are scary these days

16:18.936 --> 16:20.980
She might actually call the police and accuse you of being a stalker.

16:22.189 --> 16:24.942
She should listen to what you say first before
being serious to Yu Zhenye

16:26.026 --> 16:26.986
Yu Zhen?

16:27.903 --> 16:29.154
correct

16:29.238 --> 16:30.990
My sister also goes to that school

16:31.115 --> 16:32.366
She is in Class 5, Grade 2

16:32.449 --> 16:35.035
Same school? My Yu Zhen is also in Class 5

16:36.370 --> 16:39.581
It seems that we are destined to have a lot of common acquaintances.

16:41.333 --> 16:42.209
yes

16:44.920 --> 16:47.715
By the way, did I tell you?

16:48.382 --> 16:51.385
You are Yun Zhao’s role model

16:51.677 --> 16:55.848
She said she wanted to be like you from the beginning when she started working in public relations

16:55.931 --> 16:59.101
So she cut out all your news reports and kept them

16:59.518 --> 17:01.854
Representative Kim, I have already told her

17:01.937 --> 17:03.063
What?

17:03.522 --> 17:04.523
You move really fast

17:06.483 --> 17:10.195
But it’s really jealous when you talk about it

17:10.279 --> 17:12.072
-Are you going to choose me or Yi Jung?
-What?

17:12.156 --> 17:14.199
If Yi Zhen and I both fall into the water,
who will you save first?

17:14.283 --> 17:15.367
what are you talking about?

17:15.451 --> 17:16.660
Don't make any noise

17:18.537 --> 17:19.913
The one who can't swim

17:19.997 --> 17:21.040
Neither of us can

17:22.875 --> 17:25.544
You save her first, I'm good at swimming

17:25.711 --> 17:28.005
Hey, don't spoil the fun, listen to her

17:28.088 --> 17:30.299
- You said
- I have no comment

17:30.841 --> 17:32.134
Damn it, miss.

17:32.217 --> 17:33.260
drink

17:33.385 --> 17:34.553
-How childish
-Hey

17:34.636 --> 17:37.431
-Drink quickly
-You should save me first, right?

17:38.015 --> 17:40.309
Yunzhao, hello

17:40.809 --> 17:41.894
(Results of Serong Brand Image Questionnaire)

17:41.977 --> 17:45.022
The results of the questionnaire survey on Serong’s brand image show that

17:45.355 --> 17:48.817
More than half of the total feels old and outdated.

17:49.610 --> 17:52.071
To get rid of this brand image

17:52.154 --> 17:55.365
We chose to hold a brand identity competition
and then use the video sharing platform

17:55.866 --> 17:59.661
The final winner will be determined through a selection process

17:59.828 --> 18:02.372
and create a fan culture

18:02.456 --> 18:06.585
The above is the strategy of this brand identity
update plan

18:07.169 --> 18:09.546
So now let’s start the Q&A

18:09.630 --> 18:11.632
(Q&A time)

18:13.217 --> 18:14.301
Yes, Miss Yi Jung

18:14.384 --> 18:18.597
You said you would decide the final winner through a selection process

18:18.680 --> 18:20.349
May I ask if the final result is 100%?

18:20.432 --> 18:22.518
Is it up to the customer to make the choice?

18:22.601 --> 18:25.312
Customers will vote through the video sharing platform

18:25.395 --> 18:27.689
Will indeed reflect the opinions of customers 100%

18:27.773 --> 18:29.108
But Agent Park

18:31.443 --> 18:32.486
that…

18:35.405 --> 18:36.323
I mean Miss Yun Zhao

18:37.574 --> 18:40.410
This is Serong’s brand update

18:40.494 --> 18:42.746
How to reflect the opinions of Serong employees
and senior managers?

18:42.830 --> 18:46.917
These people just need to vote like regular customers.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.004
Because Seyong’s employees
and senior managers are also customers

18:51.296 --> 18:52.422
Mr. Nobuyasu

18:58.387 --> 19:00.013
Any other questions?

19:02.307 --> 19:04.643
So that concludes my report

19:16.113 --> 19:17.156
Caimin agent

19:19.324 --> 19:21.201
-Team Leader
-Oh my god, long time no see

19:21.285 --> 19:23.120
-how is your day?
-Ordinary

19:23.203 --> 19:24.663
- Sit down
- OK

19:25.956 --> 19:27.916
But why did you come to me?

19:28.000 --> 19:31.336
I heard that you were in Changwon
and I wanted to come to you.

19:31.420 --> 19:32.796
When I'm in a group

19:32.880 --> 19:36.133
Frequent travel to Changwon for social contribution projects

19:36.633 --> 19:39.178
I may have feelings for this place, it's nice here

19:39.261 --> 19:40.179
I see

19:40.345 --> 19:42.055
I'm here for that too

19:43.390 --> 19:44.933
You mean the attending physician plan?

19:45.017 --> 19:45.893
right

19:45.976 --> 19:48.520
Help local people contact their attending doctors for free?

19:48.604 --> 19:49.938
Currently still in the planning stage

19:50.022 --> 19:52.858
Also look for medical staff and hospitals who can help.

19:52.941 --> 19:55.402
Didn't think you'd be interested in that kind of thing

19:56.737 --> 19:57.571
Is it for business sustainability?

19:57.654 --> 20:00.407
These are the foundations you laid

20:00.490 --> 20:01.533
No

20:02.409 --> 20:03.744
thank you for saying that

20:05.871 --> 20:08.457
The rice wine here is super good

20:17.633 --> 20:18.508
Please come in

20:24.097 --> 20:25.849
are you free?

20:28.644 --> 20:31.939
Sorry I haven't contacted you very much lately

20:33.023 --> 20:35.943
I always want to procrastinate

20:36.485 --> 20:38.111
But I feel like I can’t put it off any longer.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.072
That, Donghun...

20:40.155 --> 20:41.365
Can't you forget him?

20:42.783 --> 20:44.284
Although you tried hard

20:45.035 --> 20:46.203
But there’s no way, right?

20:47.454 --> 20:48.997
Yes, I still can’t forget it

20:55.712 --> 20:56.672
Masaaki

20:57.547 --> 20:59.591
Are you in a complicated mood now?

21:00.592 --> 21:04.554
You don't know what to do
but I'm still waiting for you

21:06.014 --> 21:07.140
you feel sorry

21:07.599 --> 21:11.311
But you still can't figure out
your feelings for another person

21:12.854 --> 21:14.231
But ah

21:14.773 --> 21:16.233
Love is a thing

21:16.900 --> 21:17.943
Just take a good look

21:18.568 --> 21:19.820
Go and take a closer look

21:21.488 --> 21:24.116
You can understand

21:26.451 --> 21:27.661
That way we can clarify our feelings

21:30.247 --> 21:31.498
Wait until you understand

21:33.542 --> 21:35.043
Let's talk again

21:35.127 --> 21:37.713
That's so bad for you

21:37.796 --> 21:39.631
No, please do that

21:41.049 --> 21:43.385
Give me some time too

21:44.386 --> 21:45.679
You can do it, right?

21:49.641 --> 21:50.600
come have a drink

21:50.684 --> 21:52.769
Just have a drink today and pour it yourself

21:52.853 --> 21:53.687
Come

21:55.022 --> 21:57.190
Oh my God, it's raining so hard

22:12.539 --> 22:13.498
I'm in Changwon

22:13.582 --> 22:14.416
Um

22:14.499 --> 22:15.959
I'm smoking

22:17.794 --> 22:18.920
I…

22:20.255 --> 22:21.131
I miss Yun Zhao so much

22:22.049 --> 22:22.924
Me too

22:23.592 --> 22:24.926
Do you want Yun Zhao too?

22:25.677 --> 22:27.054
No, I miss Reporter Choi

22:28.764 --> 22:30.724
It's really upsetting that she suddenly stopped coming.

22:31.433 --> 22:32.517
Then call her

22:32.601 --> 22:33.477
don't want

22:33.935 --> 22:36.980
Hey, you must not call Xiao Zhao first

22:38.482 --> 22:39.441
I know

22:40.150 --> 22:42.986
You made that couple so embarrassed at that time

22:43.862 --> 22:45.197
You'd better be silent

22:45.781 --> 22:46.782
Is it raining there too?

22:47.407 --> 22:48.241
right

22:49.117 --> 22:51.078
Hey, do you remember before?

22:51.745 --> 22:54.039
When the three of us went to Daecheon Beach to play

22:54.956 --> 22:56.708
What about getting caught in the rain while walking on the road?

22:57.167 --> 22:58.585
Don't know, don't remember

22:58.668 --> 22:59.669
Is it there?

22:59.753 --> 23:01.505
Found it, Utopia, yes, come in quickly

23:01.588 --> 23:02.672
Hey, guests are coming

23:02.756 --> 23:03.632
Firstly

23:13.350 --> 23:14.434
Xiao Zhao

23:15.894 --> 23:18.605
I like getting wet in the rain

24:13.535 --> 24:14.744
I think

24:14.828 --> 24:17.497
I've given you enough time

24:19.291 --> 24:21.585
The world is changing

24:22.627 --> 24:24.254
After organizational adjustment

24:24.337 --> 24:26.840
and after the publication of the going concern report

24:26.923 --> 24:29.676
Foreign investors look at us differently

24:30.343 --> 24:31.887
Just like the world has changed

24:32.762 --> 24:34.097
What do you want to say?

24:36.725 --> 24:38.185
I will be at the shareholders meeting

24:39.269 --> 24:41.605
File your case for removal

24:42.856 --> 24:46.610
I want to change the last piece of the puzzle in the world

24:48.570 --> 24:49.571
it's you

24:51.865 --> 24:53.742
I will fight for the votes of shareholders

24:53.825 --> 24:54.784
Fight her

24:55.410 --> 24:56.995
How dare you arbitrarily file a case for dismissal?

24:57.954 --> 24:59.539
That would cause a commotion

25:00.081 --> 25:02.459
Others will definitely say that Shirong is just a room

25:03.585 --> 25:05.754
A company that only fights over its own jobs

25:07.464 --> 25:09.132
Don't think about me

25:10.675 --> 25:12.260
Think about the company

25:13.637 --> 25:14.596
vice president

25:15.138 --> 25:17.349
I just want to take a break, this is just right

25:18.266 --> 25:21.186
I can read unfinished books or go fishing

25:22.604 --> 25:24.856
But there's something I regret

25:24.940 --> 25:27.692
When something happened to Mr. Kim, who I have worked with all my life,

25:29.444 --> 25:31.363
I should just resign

25:31.988 --> 25:34.407
But I shirked my responsibility at the time

25:36.868 --> 25:37.953
that matter

25:38.995 --> 25:40.372
Make me regret it

25:42.916 --> 25:47.587
(Communications Department)

25:52.717 --> 25:53.802
Miss Yun Zhao

25:54.261 --> 25:55.887
-That Rondak
-Hmm

25:55.971 --> 25:59.349
It will also host
the competition for this brand identity update.

25:59.641 --> 26:00.809
How do you think it should be managed?

26:00.892 --> 26:04.062
How about you take charge of this?

26:04.145 --> 26:07.607
Now I am too busy just doing digital PR and Shixiang

26:08.984 --> 26:10.735
OK, if you want to leave it to me

26:10.819 --> 26:12.529
If I can't do it, I'll find an outsourcer

26:12.612 --> 26:13.446
good

26:15.365 --> 26:16.491
So…

26:16.575 --> 26:18.410
Next is this

26:28.336 --> 26:29.212
good

26:30.046 --> 26:31.131
Next one is…

26:39.764 --> 26:40.765
sorry

26:46.354 --> 26:47.314
but

26:47.772 --> 26:49.524
I don't want to choose him

26:50.984 --> 26:51.901
but

26:52.736 --> 26:55.238
I really can't forget him

26:57.991 --> 27:00.952
I plan to focus on work for now

27:02.662 --> 27:03.872
Like me?

27:05.582 --> 27:07.834
I've been working too hard lately

27:08.627 --> 27:10.754
The company's business is getting more and more prosperous

27:15.091 --> 27:16.217
sorry

27:17.093 --> 27:18.094
So

27:18.970 --> 27:20.513
Are we going to break up?

27:23.224 --> 27:26.770
I can't be friends with you yet

27:29.189 --> 27:30.732
see you

27:31.775 --> 27:33.276
I still feel heartache

27:33.693 --> 27:34.569
but

27:35.236 --> 27:38.281
I think time will dilute this feeling.

27:39.824 --> 27:40.784
By the time…

27:44.537 --> 27:45.914
Let's be friends again

27:58.218 --> 27:59.386
Where are you?

28:00.095 --> 28:01.846
Mom took the house deposit and left

28:03.181 --> 28:04.641
Call the real estate company quickly

28:10.355 --> 28:11.731
What happened?

28:18.363 --> 28:19.531
Have you asked the real estate company?

28:19.614 --> 28:20.949
Does mom really want to give up the rent?

28:21.366 --> 28:24.202
Yes, I asked

28:27.205 --> 28:28.832
So are we really going to be kicked out?

28:30.875 --> 28:33.378
Where did the people go after she made things like this ?

28:34.045 --> 28:35.463
You can't contact her either, right?

28:36.214 --> 28:37.966
People from her company said she went on a trip

28:38.049 --> 28:40.009
Are we going to be kicked out?

28:42.512 --> 28:43.847
No, no

28:43.930 --> 28:44.806
preferably

28:45.181 --> 28:46.975
It's clearly written on your face that you will

28:48.601 --> 28:49.769
Damn it

28:52.522 --> 28:54.607
It's so late, where are you going?

28:54.691 --> 28:56.317
Where do I go? What does it have to do with you?

28:57.360 --> 29:00.447
Anyway, if Ms. Hanako wasn't here,
you wouldn't live with me at all.

29:00.530 --> 29:02.449
How could you say that?

29:03.700 --> 29:05.452
You obviously don't care about me at all

29:08.329 --> 29:09.622
Hello, Li Haizhao!

29:35.732 --> 29:37.734
Your unanswered call
will be forwarded to...

29:38.610 --> 29:39.569
children

29:40.195 --> 29:41.279
-Hello
_

29:41.821 --> 29:43.031
Have you seen Hai Zhao?

29:43.114 --> 29:45.200
I didn't see her today. Have you seen her?

29:45.283 --> 29:46.326
I didn't see her either

29:46.993 --> 29:47.911
Yeah?

29:55.418 --> 29:56.628
Are you...

29:57.045 --> 29:58.671
-It's you
-Hello

29:59.297 --> 30:00.173
Have you seen Hai Zhao?

30:01.174 --> 30:02.342
Kaisho?

30:02.425 --> 30:04.052
I can't contact her either

30:04.135 --> 30:05.011
-Really?
-yes

30:05.094 --> 30:06.095
Hey, where's Hai Zhao?

30:06.179 --> 30:07.430
-Hey, Yu Zhen!
-hateful

30:08.014 --> 30:08.890
do what?

30:09.891 --> 30:10.809
What's wrong?

30:13.686 --> 30:14.729
Are you Yu Zhen?

30:15.897 --> 30:17.315
Do you know me?

30:18.191 --> 30:21.027
I know your mother and I respect her very much

30:22.111 --> 30:23.571
It turns out you are Hai Zhao’s sister

30:23.655 --> 30:24.489
That's right

30:24.739 --> 30:25.698
Are you familiar with Hai Zhao?

30:26.783 --> 30:28.535
Do you know where Hai Zhao is?

30:33.581 --> 30:35.124
I'm not that familiar with her

30:36.626 --> 30:37.627
is that so?

30:42.048 --> 30:42.924
I'll take a call

30:45.510 --> 30:46.719
-What's wrong?
-Hello? Hello

30:46.803 --> 30:48.054
-She ran away from home
-She ran away from home

30:48.137 --> 30:49.889
Yes, I am Park Yoon-so

30:51.724 --> 30:53.142
Are you the chief?

31:06.072 --> 31:06.906
Masaaki!

31:15.206 --> 31:16.207
Tongyeong

31:31.639 --> 31:33.099
Why haven't you come back yet?

31:33.808 --> 31:35.977
Your grandmother passed away

31:53.161 --> 31:55.663
Cai Min, where are Yun Zhao? Is she okay?

31:55.747 --> 31:57.373
Yun Zhao in the morgue

32:50.760 --> 32:51.803
Masaaki

33:34.554 --> 33:38.808
Your grandma has been worried about you and you
didn't expect her to leave like this.

33:39.392 --> 33:41.477
No matter what, you must be strong

33:41.561 --> 33:42.603
good

33:59.078 --> 34:00.538
Why are you out there alone?

34:03.416 --> 34:05.001
I want to blow some air

34:06.919 --> 34:07.754
Aren't you hungry?

34:08.546 --> 34:11.799
If you continue like this, you'll even faint.
You'd better eat something.

34:13.176 --> 34:14.218
Thank you

34:16.220 --> 34:18.848
As soon as I heard the news that my grandma passed away,

34:19.640 --> 34:21.809
The first thing I think of is you

34:25.313 --> 34:27.899
That's great, I have a car after all

34:29.859 --> 34:31.527
It has nothing to do with whether you have a car or not.

34:33.696 --> 34:37.658
you are the closest person to me

34:39.243 --> 34:40.203
so i thank you very much

34:43.331 --> 34:47.251
I plan to say thank you more in the future.

34:48.586 --> 34:50.713
I won't just keep it in my heart anymore

34:51.422 --> 34:52.799
I'm going to express it

34:54.175 --> 34:56.344
I should also express my feelings to grandma

34:58.346 --> 34:59.847
I should tell her I love her

35:01.682 --> 35:02.892
Thank her very much

35:04.769 --> 35:06.437
I should have told her

35:41.097 --> 35:43.391
But is your boyfriend that busy?

35:43.975 --> 35:45.309
I don't want to stay with you

35:45.768 --> 35:47.728
Yes, because we broke up

35:48.437 --> 35:49.480
What?

35:53.025 --> 35:54.193
Why did you say it now?

35:54.652 --> 35:55.695
Otherwise, when are you going to say it?

35:55.903 --> 35:58.197
I already told you the first time

35:59.407 --> 36:00.283
It seems too

36:03.870 --> 36:05.997
my mother is here

36:06.289 --> 36:08.916
What can I do?

36:10.585 --> 36:13.087
Mother!

36:13.171 --> 36:14.797
Mother!

36:19.135 --> 36:22.680
Mom, what should I do? Mother…

36:23.139 --> 36:25.433
What should I do?

36:28.686 --> 36:30.897
-how so?
-come in

36:31.439 --> 36:34.817
- She must be lonely.
- I hate funerals because they're scary.

36:34.901 --> 36:36.652
I hate my dad's funeral too

36:38.237 --> 36:39.071
correct

36:40.072 --> 36:41.365
You hate my dad, right?

36:44.035 --> 36:45.870
what are you talking about? Why would I...

36:45.953 --> 36:47.622
I heard that you paid for my father’s medical expenses.

36:49.540 --> 36:51.667
He is obviously not your father
but you work like hell for him

36:52.043 --> 36:53.085
Mom always says that

36:54.128 --> 36:57.006
You should have told me before you left.

36:57.089 --> 36:57.965
Kaisho

36:59.217 --> 37:01.636
-I never hated Uncle Bingji
-Mom

37:01.969 --> 37:03.262
I really like him

37:03.346 --> 37:06.682
-Because he was very nice to me
. -My mother is so pitiful.

37:07.308 --> 37:09.185
That's why I hope he can recover

37:12.188 --> 37:15.483
Mother!

37:20.988 --> 37:26.244
Why don't you leave later?
I didn't get to see you for the last time

37:49.267 --> 37:50.559
It's time to go now

37:52.478 --> 37:53.729
yes

37:54.355 --> 37:56.649
Come on, let's go

37:57.275 --> 37:58.359
I don't have a mother now

37:59.443 --> 38:03.447
There is no one in this world that I can call mom.

38:03.531 --> 38:05.449
It's not just you

38:05.825 --> 38:06.951
Many people are

38:08.160 --> 38:11.247
Even if some people have mothers
, they will not look for them or go to see them

38:11.747 --> 38:12.957
Like you?

38:14.417 --> 38:16.877
Some people, like you,
don’t call their mothers properly.

38:19.338 --> 38:21.507
Stop talking, I'm very sad now too

38:22.133 --> 38:24.093
If you want to stay here, that's up to you

38:24.176 --> 38:25.928
I'll go back with the others first

38:28.097 --> 38:30.599
From the first time I took you to my mother

38:32.059 --> 38:34.687
Just call me Ms. Hanako.

38:37.398 --> 38:39.775
You said I abandoned you, so I'm not your mother

38:40.651 --> 38:42.111
That’s why you call me Ms. Hanako

38:42.903 --> 38:44.447
That's what you said then

38:44.530 --> 38:46.157
You were only 11 years old then

38:46.741 --> 38:48.200
I'm sorry for you, so I'll let you call me

38:50.077 --> 38:53.748
I want to say it’s okay, just call me Ms. Hanako.

38:54.206 --> 38:56.792
I want to hear you call me that all my life

39:02.214 --> 39:03.090
Because I feel guilty

39:09.597 --> 39:12.641
You're just living your own life.
What's there to feel guilty about?

39:13.976 --> 39:17.605
I know you took me to grandma's place to protect me.

39:17.897 --> 39:19.774
So I can escape that weird bastard

39:37.750 --> 39:39.377
I know all this

39:39.627 --> 39:40.795
so let's go

39:48.677 --> 39:50.596
This has to be spread on the mountain

39:50.679 --> 39:51.931
Because my mother likes mountains very much

39:52.014 --> 39:54.725
It's the sea, she likes it better

39:55.601 --> 39:56.894
I am not sure as well

39:56.977 --> 39:58.354
Anyway she said

39:58.437 --> 40:00.106
-Never put it in the Celestial Bones Tower
-Don't put it in the Celestial Bones Tower

40:04.360 --> 40:05.194
let's go

40:06.779 --> 40:07.613
let's go

40:10.950 --> 40:12.284
That man…

40:12.368 --> 40:13.327
house deposit

40:14.787 --> 40:16.497
Did you take the deposit?

40:17.623 --> 40:19.625
You shouldn't use that money to travel, right?

40:19.708 --> 40:22.420
I think you are crazy. How is that possible?

40:22.503 --> 40:23.546
I think so

40:23.629 --> 40:25.756
30 million Korean won
is too much to spend on a trip to Southeast Asia

40:25.840 --> 40:27.007
of course

40:27.091 --> 40:29.385
-Where did you spend it?
-that…

40:29.468 --> 40:32.263
Just like Bitcoin

40:32.930 --> 40:35.224
When you return to Seoul, pack your bags and move out

40:36.475 --> 40:38.060
Hai Zhao and I will continue to live there

40:38.144 --> 40:39.103
wrong

40:39.520 --> 40:41.147
Hai Zhao, let’s move out

40:41.230 --> 40:44.024
Anyway, Ms. Hanako has ruined that room.

40:44.108 --> 40:45.443
I agree with moving out

40:45.526 --> 40:47.403
I haven't lost all my money yet

40:47.486 --> 40:50.781
I just invested it.
Do you know what investment is?

40:52.158 --> 40:53.242
that…

40:53.868 --> 40:56.328
Do you want to have a meal before going back?

40:56.412 --> 40:59.707
OK, thanks, that's great

40:59.790 --> 41:01.584
Wait a minute, what's your name?

41:01.667 --> 41:02.710
Is your name Caimin?

41:02.793 --> 41:05.921
Let me think about it, I was too panicked just now
and now my mind is a little confused

41:06.005 --> 41:07.465
Yes, that’s right, my name is Yoo Jae-min

41:07.548 --> 41:11.510
That's it, but where do I sit?

41:11.635 --> 41:13.429
Let me see how this works...

41:13.512 --> 41:15.514
What are you doing? come here quickly

41:18.058 --> 41:19.018
good

41:19.768 --> 41:22.021
You said you had something to tell me, what was it?

41:26.984 --> 41:28.527
Or do you want me to leave?

41:31.405 --> 41:33.949
You said you respect Ms. Goo Yi Jung very much?

41:35.201 --> 41:36.243
"Ms. Goo Yi Jung"?

41:36.327 --> 41:38.078
What do you respect about her?

41:41.790 --> 41:43.459
Why do you want to ask this?

41:44.251 --> 41:45.753
Because I don't understand that side of her

41:45.836 --> 41:47.296
You probably don’t know her at all, right?

41:48.339 --> 41:50.299
Do you really know her?

42:02.102 --> 42:04.396
I want to bring it inexplicably

42:05.105 --> 42:06.482

I didn’t expect that the vice president would abdicate obediently.

42:44.603 --> 42:47.856
He probably wants to keep his dignity.

42:47.940 --> 42:49.650
This is indeed very respectable

42:52.653 --> 42:54.280
So I have something to ask you, Yi Jung.

42:57.449 --> 42:58.576
You should be the vice president

42:59.410 --> 43:01.245

Hello?

43:14.550 --> 43:15.968

43:27.438 --> 43:28.981
- I'm leaving
- No...

43:34.653 --> 43:35.613
come in

Yu Zhen

45:02.741 --> 45:06.078
if i wasn't your mother

45:07.079 --> 45:09.206
But what will happen to your father?

45:10.708 --> 45:14.420
If your father says he wants to study abroad

45:14.503 --> 45:17.464
Then our whole family should move to a foreign country together.

45:19.425 --> 45:21.427

45:21.844 --> 45:25.097
But I couldn't do that back then

45:26.557 --> 45:28.100

45:29.768 --> 45:30.894

I leave you here in order to live the life I want.

I'm really sorry

45:55.919 --> 45:57.504
I'm really sorry, Yu Zhen

45:59.798 --> 46:01.383
I'm really sorry

46:07.806 --> 46:08.682
but

46:09.600 --> 46:10.684
i'm really stupid

46:12.478 --> 46:14.855
I thought I just wanted to come back and talk to you

46:14.938 --> 46:17.566
can repair our relationship

46:17.649 --> 46:20.569
But things didn't go that well
so I panicked.

46:25.157 --> 46:25.991

Compared with other political parties,
our party members are older

49:50.737 --> 49:51.613
That's the problem

49:51.697 --> 49:54.491
Then just increase the number of young party members.

49:55.158 --> 49:59.037
Target young party members
with a promise that they will be interested

49:59.121 --> 50:02.374
Just spend all your time fighting with Xia Taijun
on this

50:06.545 --> 50:09.756
Do you want to reconsider my last proposal?

50:09.840 --> 50:12.342
I don’t know how you would feel if you were rejected twice.

50:21.143 --> 50:23.562
You sent me a photo last time

50:24.146 --> 50:25.230
Just say it has something to do with Yu Zhen

50:26.356 --> 50:28.400
I don't know what time her class is

50:28.692 --> 50:31.737
So I waited outside the tutorial center for several days.

50:33.155 --> 50:35.407
That really sounds like something you would do

50:35.490 --> 50:36.450
but

50:37.451 --> 50:39.286
I still think I should thank you

50:41.329 --> 50:43.832
What are you doing? This is very unlike you

50:47.294 --> 50:48.295
Is it because of Yu Zhen?

50:49.046 --> 50:51.465
Although we are not husband and wife, we cannot be friends either

50:51.548 --> 50:53.550
But we are Yu Zhen’s parents

50:55.177 --> 50:56.178
Play this role well

50:57.137 --> 50:57.971
good

51:00.599 --> 51:03.310
(resignation letter)

51:10.776 --> 51:11.943
Team leader

51:12.027 --> 51:13.612
Wait, let me collect my thoughts

51:21.411 --> 51:22.954
If I stop you...

51:23.038 --> 51:25.082
No, if I keep you

51:25.874 --> 51:27.084
Will you stay?

51:29.586 --> 51:32.089
It seems not, you have already made up your mind.

51:34.049 --> 51:36.218
Okay, then there's nothing I can do

51:36.301 --> 51:38.512
Thank you very much for this time, team leader

51:39.471 --> 51:40.347
You're welcome

52:21.763 --> 52:22.848
Hello

52:22.931 --> 52:24.349
When are you moving?

52:25.517 --> 52:26.601
I'm not moving

52:27.561 --> 52:29.354
I returned the deposit to the landlord

52:29.437 --> 52:31.022
Did your mother get the money she invested back?

52:31.106 --> 52:33.900
How can it be? I used my deposit to advance it.

52:34.985 --> 52:39.114
Start rebuilding here, we
have to hold on until they kick us out.

52:40.407 --> 52:41.324
I save that money

52:41.408 --> 52:43.285
I originally wanted to study abroad

52:45.662 --> 52:47.539
Really? Are you going to study abroad?

52:47.622 --> 52:48.957
I can't go now

52:49.875 --> 52:52.043
I originally wanted to study hard and seriously

52:54.129 --> 52:56.464
Just read the book here.

52:58.091 --> 52:59.593
why are you laughing?

53:04.598 --> 53:07.684
I'm glad I have someone to play with

53:08.018 --> 53:10.478
I don't have time to play with you

53:10.812 --> 53:13.148
I will study very seriously

53:13.273 --> 53:16.693
When I grow up and become more knowledgeable

53:16.902 --> 53:19.154
I want to work in a company with a high salary

53:23.783 --> 53:24.701
What's wrong?

53:25.160 --> 53:26.870
Don't you want to see me succeed?

53:26.953 --> 53:28.163
no

53:29.122 --> 53:31.917
I'm just wondering how long I have to wait

53:38.798 --> 53:40.717
I won't stop you from reading

53:41.468 --> 53:44.512
But after you finish studying hard,
can you spare some time for me?

53:45.055 --> 53:47.307
Why should I make time for you?

53:47.390 --> 53:48.266
Aren't we friends?

53:48.350 --> 53:49.309
Let's not be friends anymore

53:51.061 --> 53:52.103
Let's be a couple

54:18.922 --> 54:19.756
Did you agree?

54:21.299 --> 54:24.302
Promise what? There are still two years left

54:26.221 --> 54:28.139
Let's not talk about the future now

54:29.224 --> 54:31.977
After all, no one knows what the future will be like

54:33.228 --> 54:36.815
Well, compared to the time you waited for me

54:37.649 --> 54:39.067
Two years is nothing at all

54:47.117 --> 54:48.451
Anyway now

54:49.160 --> 54:51.705
I will support you as a friend

54:51.788 --> 54:54.416
I will accept your support.

55:08.263 --> 55:10.682
Hello, we are doing a survey

55:10.765 --> 55:13.101
A small gift will be given after filling out the form

55:13.226 --> 55:14.436
Thanks

55:14.519 --> 55:17.605
(one year later)

55:17.689 --> 55:19.983
Hello, we are doing a survey

55:20.066 --> 55:22.193
Okay, thank you

55:22.277 --> 55:24.612
Hello, we are doing a survey

55:25.196 --> 55:29.284
Communicate with customers and increase awareness

55:29.367 --> 55:31.077
are two major points in building a brand

55:31.161 --> 55:32.537
What is the brand?

55:32.620 --> 55:35.874
A brand is more than just
a name printed on a company’s merchandise…

55:50.013 --> 55:52.849
Salary rewards really motivate employees the most

55:53.600 --> 55:56.978
But as a representative, after I became the team leader, I discovered

55:57.687 --> 56:00.940
Competition between groups is too fierce

56:01.524 --> 56:02.359
look

56:03.276 --> 56:04.861
Have you seen my bald head?

56:04.944 --> 56:06.321
Here, see the hole here?

56:06.404 --> 56:07.614
Yes, I saw it

56:10.033 --> 56:12.869
So your team won first place again this time?

56:12.952 --> 56:15.789
That's what I got in exchange for my hair

56:17.957 --> 56:19.751
What I want to say is

56:20.418 --> 56:22.754
I will work harder in the future

56:23.213 --> 56:24.923
representative, loyal

56:25.507 --> 56:26.508
good

56:27.133 --> 56:28.843
Then I'll go out first

56:29.761 --> 56:34.766
Do you find it stressful to meet with me every week?

56:34.891 --> 56:36.851
What do the team members think?

56:37.352 --> 56:41.481
How can any company representative personally interview employees like you ?

56:41.940 --> 56:43.441
And you are not a representative of old-fashioned things either.

56:43.900 --> 56:45.235
You don't need to worry too much

56:45.819 --> 56:46.736
That's good

56:49.155 --> 56:52.742
But you can't meet with us for the time being, right?

56:54.285 --> 56:55.203
yes

57:00.625 --> 57:03.002
Questionnaire is here

57:10.635 --> 57:12.512
Hey, my part-time salary has increased

57:12.595 --> 57:15.265
After all, it’s so tiring to find people to fill out questionnaires offline.

57:15.557 --> 57:17.642
I'll ask them to give you a raise

57:17.725 --> 57:18.977
Thank you

57:20.061 --> 57:21.104
Team leader

57:22.188 --> 57:23.022
Masaaki

57:23.690 --> 57:25.483
How is the institute? Is it fun?

57:25.984 --> 57:28.611
It must not be fun.
After all, books are not read for fun.

57:29.195 --> 57:32.657
But you rejected so many agents in the first place

57:32.740 --> 57:34.242
Insist on going to graduate school

57:35.160 --> 57:36.494
I think he's very handsome

57:36.578 --> 57:37.620
Super stylish

57:41.541 --> 57:43.251
I'll be counting on you from now on too

57:47.839 --> 57:49.340
I heard you're going to Los Angeles

57:49.591 --> 57:51.718
Yes, we opened a branch in Los Angeles

57:51.801 --> 57:53.678
We need someone to manage it for the time being.

57:53.761 --> 57:56.723
Oh my God, global communication is really powerful.

57:57.599 --> 57:59.392
Otherwise, come to the United States too

57:59.476 --> 58:00.852
I can give you the position of team leader

58:00.935 --> 58:03.104
thank you for your suggestion

58:04.063 --> 58:07.525
Really, hey, why are you asking her to go to the United States?

58:07.942 --> 58:10.069
If she wants to be the team leader
, just be here with me.

58:10.153 --> 58:11.321
-Right?
-senior

58:15.074 --> 58:17.118
Then we'll see you next time

58:17.785 --> 58:19.621
Okay, take care of yourself

58:21.998 --> 58:23.541
-Cheers
-Cheers

58:28.755 --> 58:30.048
Really delicious, super good

58:30.131 --> 58:31.466
(Yi Zhen)

58:32.133 --> 58:33.009
It's Yi Zhen

58:35.428 --> 58:36.679
She also passed it on to me

58:42.894 --> 58:44.479
So beautiful

58:46.606 --> 58:49.108
Yu Zhen actually dropped out of school and traveled around the world

58:49.192 --> 58:53.112
This mother and daughter are so adventurous

58:53.613 --> 58:54.906
So envious

58:55.615 --> 58:58.868
Stop what you are doing and start traveling like this

58:58.952 --> 59:00.328
It also takes a lot of courage

59:02.664 --> 59:05.166
There are many things once you miss the moment

59:05.250 --> 59:08.002
I'll never have the chance to do it again.

59:08.086 --> 59:09.546
Yi Jung told me

59:09.629 --> 59:14.759
She wanted Yu Zhen to see a wider world before she was 20 years old

59:15.635 --> 59:18.805
And she wanted to go through that process with her.

59:19.639 --> 59:21.849
-I'm so envious.
-What's there to envy?

59:21.933 --> 59:23.309
Hey, it would be great if we also go on a trip.

59:23.393 --> 59:24.936
Let's go when you have a holiday. Where do you want to go?

59:25.019 --> 59:25.937
How about Spain?

59:26.020 --> 59:26.938
-Spain?
-Okay?

59:27.021 --> 59:27.897
OK

59:27.981 --> 59:30.608
We went to Spain to learn flamenco dancing

59:30.692 --> 59:32.819
Is this how it dances?

59:32.902 --> 59:34.529
Still like this?

59:35.530 --> 59:37.782
But they are almost coming back, right?

59:52.213 --> 59:53.256
is it here?

59:54.048 --> 59:55.425
Seems

59:55.675 --> 59:56.759
Let's go in

59:57.594 --> 59:58.595
good

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:05.935
you really don't know

01:00:06.144 --> 01:00:07.562
Why did she come to us?

01:00:07.645 --> 01:00:08.896
Yes, I don't know

01:00:09.522 --> 01:00:11.107
What on earth is this place?

01:00:11.899 --> 01:00:13.526
It seems to be newly built

01:00:13.776 --> 01:00:15.486
It smells like a new house

01:00:15.862 --> 01:00:17.447
It must be the smell of paint

01:00:18.239 --> 01:00:19.198
yes

01:00:20.158 --> 01:00:21.492
That's what I'm talking about

01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:32.420
Miss Yi Zhen!

01:00:42.639 --> 01:00:44.974
The scenery here is so spectacular

01:00:48.311 --> 01:00:50.396
But why are you looking for us?

01:00:52.065 --> 01:00:55.943
I came to you because
I want to look in the same direction as you

01:00:57.945 --> 01:01:01.532
I want to move in the same direction as you

01:01:08.039 --> 01:01:09.207
what does that mean?

01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:10.416
Don’t you understand yet?

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.668
I'm poaching you guys

01:01:13.169 --> 01:01:15.171
How about it? Do you want to work with me?

01:01:15.254 --> 01:01:16.506
i need you two

01:01:20.593 --> 01:01:21.886
but I…

01:01:21.969 --> 01:01:24.222
I know you have one year left to graduate from graduate school.

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:25.765
You can work part-time

01:01:25.848 --> 01:01:27.475
Just do your best

01:01:27.558 --> 01:01:29.060
Pay careful attention to every minute

01:01:29.143 --> 01:01:30.978
Tired to the point of nosebleeds and staying up late every day

01:01:31.062 --> 01:01:33.272
Just put in the enthusiasm and try it.

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:35.733
My whole body is full of strength now

01:01:37.485 --> 01:01:38.861
This is the you I know

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:43.783
No problem for me, we can start work right away

01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:44.784
as expected

01:01:45.326 --> 01:01:47.453
Then you all agreed?

01:01:48.663 --> 01:01:50.456
- No problem
- No problem

01:02:47.722 --> 01:02:49.724
