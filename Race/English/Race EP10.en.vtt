Workplace Competition Code

00:41.041 --> 00:43.918
(The characters, events, groups, organizations
and backgrounds of this drama are purely fictitious. We hereby inform you that)

00:45.795 --> 00:48.673
I want to expose the domineering and oppressive behavior of the big company Se Yong

00:48.757 --> 00:51.718
Doesn't Serong have a
message board to listen to customers' voices?

00:52.260 --> 00:54.137
Something big happened there now

00:54.220 --> 00:56.514
Some people say they want to expose the inside story of Shirong's bullying.

00:57.015 --> 00:58.892
He also said that the person in charge, Park Yoon-soo,

00:59.309 --> 01:02.479
His career was ruined and
even his employees fell down.

01:05.148 --> 01:06.316
So is this true?

01:06.941 --> 01:08.151
right

01:09.444 --> 01:11.946
You deliberately disparage other companies' products

01:12.030 --> 01:15.200
Fabricating false information and spreading it, right?

01:17.118 --> 01:19.120
Please answer me, Agent Park Yun-soo

01:21.206 --> 01:22.040
right

01:30.298 --> 01:32.842
Team Leader Chi Yinzhen, did you know this already?

01:50.944 --> 01:52.403
Representative Park Yoon-soo, the person in charge

01:52.487 --> 01:54.447
Please tell me what happened so far

01:54.531 --> 01:57.617
Write a report in detail and give it to me

01:58.493 --> 02:01.871
You must write the truth, no lies

02:01.955 --> 02:02.997
Understand?

02:05.208 --> 02:07.001
Understand? Agent Park Yun-soo

02:07.836 --> 02:08.920
yes

02:09.295 --> 02:10.296
There are three more groups

02:10.380 --> 02:12.382
If it is discovered that your entire group was involved

02:12.465 --> 02:13.967
Then it’s not just Park Yoon-soo’s agent

02:14.050 --> 02:15.426
Your entire group may be disbanded.

02:16.636 --> 02:19.556
I hope you take this matter seriously

02:40.618 --> 02:42.370
Your unanswered call
will be forwarded to...

02:42.453 --> 02:44.122
(Masaaki)

03:11.941 --> 03:13.484
That brat...

03:16.362 --> 03:18.114
What are you doing? Why can't I get through the company phone?

03:18.198 --> 03:19.657
We unplugged the phone lines

03:20.158 --> 03:21.784
Reporters have also learned the news

03:23.203 --> 03:26.080
Since when did they
care so much about Shi Yong's discussion forum?

03:26.164 --> 03:27.332
It really scared me to death

03:27.415 --> 03:29.334
Maybe it’s because something happened on the social platform that I represented before .

03:29.417 --> 03:32.420
Anyway, reporters kept calling like crazy.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.505
Team leader Song asked us to unplug the phone line.

03:34.589 --> 03:35.590
How is Yun Zhao doing?

03:36.507 --> 03:39.302
- How are you, Agent Park?
- She is your friend, why are you asking me?

03:39.385 --> 03:40.470
Because she doesn't listen to my calls

03:40.553 --> 03:42.931
Director Goo came down early in the morning

03:43.598 --> 03:45.016
He scolded us

03:46.309 --> 03:48.061
Hey, do you know?

03:48.436 --> 03:51.814
In fact, this is not the first time we have done negative marketing.

03:52.273 --> 03:53.775
It's just that everyone comes secretly

03:53.858 --> 03:59.572
But Director Goo suddenly became furious this time,
so no one dared to say anything.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.950
- I asked you how Yun Zhao is doing
- Yun Zhao?

04:02.033 --> 04:03.660
Are you only worried about your friends?

04:03.743 --> 04:05.203
She's not the only problem

04:05.286 --> 04:07.038
The entire three groups may be disbanded

04:07.705 --> 04:09.540
Hey, have you read the article in the discussion forum?

04:10.750 --> 04:14.295
If you watch, you will know that
Agent Park is basically a traitor

04:14.379 --> 04:18.216
The other party's accomplice was hospitalized
and the store could hardly continue to operate.

04:18.299 --> 04:19.175
so what?

04:20.009 --> 04:21.886
Are they planning
to frame everything on Agent Park this time too?

04:21.970 --> 04:24.847
- What?
- The actual person in charge is Shin Ji-hyo

04:24.973 --> 04:27.475
The team leaders and the sales team all know about this.

04:27.558 --> 04:29.686
Both the third group and the second group participated.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.145
But who would know this?

04:31.229 --> 04:33.898
After all, the name of the person in charge on the document
is Park Yoon-soo.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.733
That's how things will turn out

04:37.527 --> 04:39.487
But are you angry at me now?

04:40.071 --> 04:41.698
I know, let's do this first

04:45.243 --> 04:46.953
Why is he angry with me?

04:47.036 --> 04:49.455
(Masaaki)

04:56.879 --> 04:58.172
(Jae Min)

04:58.756 --> 05:00.675
There is no response to the number you called. Please wait after the beep...

05:03.428 --> 05:04.762
Call me when you're fine

05:04.846 --> 05:06.431
I have something to go to Changwon now.

05:07.348 --> 05:08.599
Will go back today

05:15.356 --> 05:19.694
It doesn't matter,
no one thought he would upload that kind of article

05:21.362 --> 05:22.488
- Senior
- Yes

05:34.959 --> 05:36.711
About the Shi Yong discussion forum...

05:36.836 --> 05:38.421
I know, I've heard it

05:39.172 --> 05:41.424
Didn't Yun Zhao come to the company yesterday?

05:44.886 --> 05:45.803
yesterday

05:47.013 --> 05:48.222
Director An said

05:49.265 --> 05:53.144
She found that she didn't take something,
so she went back to the office

05:53.227 --> 05:56.522
Maybe that's when she
heard that Se Yong did it.

05:57.648 --> 06:00.276
So it was Chief An who told the truth?

06:00.360 --> 06:02.695
She only told me

06:02.779 --> 06:03.863
She came and asked me what to do

06:04.822 --> 06:08.159
But this matter was raised by the ginger boss who sells high-protein bread.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.412
heard by chance

06:11.496 --> 06:13.706
I didn't expect him to post an article in the discussion forum

06:16.292 --> 06:19.003
Where is Yun Zhao? Have you contacted her?

06:19.087 --> 06:20.088
have

06:20.171 --> 06:23.466
She came yesterday to ask what she should do

06:24.842 --> 06:26.344
She said she couldn't stop it

06:26.427 --> 06:28.930
But I can't stand by and watch

06:29.972 --> 06:31.057
this…

06:31.974 --> 06:34.477
Although overall it’s Se Yong’s problem

06:34.560 --> 06:35.853
But what I'm worried about is

06:36.521 --> 06:40.316
They'll find a scapegoat to cover it up

06:40.942 --> 06:43.945
I'm more worried that that person will be Yun Zhao

07:07.260 --> 07:08.553
I'm here to find her, tell me

07:09.429 --> 07:13.391
I just want to say a few words to you

07:13.850 --> 07:16.436
Didn't you ask me what I plan to do next?

07:16.519 --> 07:18.938
He also asked me how to run the company like this

07:19.021 --> 07:21.441
How can we continue to sit in the representative seat?

07:21.524 --> 07:22.400
represent

07:23.401 --> 07:27.655
I want to tell you
that the current public opinion about Se Yong is very bad.

07:28.239 --> 07:32.410
I think this is all because
we lack a strategy chief

07:32.910 --> 07:34.829
The Public Relations Office is affiliated to the Strategy Headquarters

07:34.912 --> 07:36.497
Now the department is missing a head

07:37.915 --> 07:39.333
What exactly is going on?

07:39.459 --> 07:41.043
I'm still figuring out the truth

07:41.169 --> 07:44.255
So what are you going to do after clarifying the truth?

07:44.338 --> 07:46.090
If they really did something wrong they should apologize

07:46.174 --> 07:48.092
and assume corresponding responsibilities

07:50.052 --> 07:51.012
Did you hear that?

07:51.095 --> 07:54.765
They're not going to sit idly by
and you're worrying too much

07:55.183 --> 07:58.644
Employees who keep causing disputes are indeed problematic

07:59.145 --> 08:03.149
But organizations that leave their employees alone
are also problematic.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.902
So it's not just that employee.

08:07.445 --> 08:11.365
The head of the organization to which the employee belongs
cannot escape responsibility.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.285
She didn't always cause strife

08:15.953 --> 08:17.413
But you're right

08:17.538 --> 08:21.375
As the head of the public relations office,
of course I also have to take responsibility.

08:21.876 --> 08:25.129
I will take responsibility if necessary

08:31.677 --> 08:33.387
You must feel very happy

08:33.971 --> 08:35.973
After all you've heard everything you wanted to hear

08:40.061 --> 08:41.395
thank you for the tea

08:47.610 --> 08:51.030
(Representative Office)

08:58.829 --> 09:01.457
What will be served for lunch in the staff cafeteria today?

09:01.541 --> 09:04.293
Today it’s bean sprout soup and spicy stir-fried pork

09:04.377 --> 09:05.336
Not bad

09:05.503 --> 09:07.421
Did the conversation go well just now?

09:09.090 --> 09:10.841
Tell Director Zheng Shouhuan to get ready.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.510
I will make a decision soon

09:12.885 --> 09:14.428
Sorry, Vice President

09:15.638 --> 09:17.723
Although Director Zheng is a good talent,

09:18.391 --> 09:21.185
But Director Chen has also served in the public relations office for a long time.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.688
His loyalty is unmatched by anyone's

09:24.689 --> 09:26.524
Don't decide so quickly

09:26.607 --> 09:29.026
How about giving it a little more thought?

09:29.986 --> 09:30.820
Then do it this way

09:30.903 --> 09:32.071
yes

09:36.909 --> 09:37.994
What was that like just now?

09:38.536 --> 09:41.038
He's officially declared war on us, right?

09:41.122 --> 09:44.625
If this continues, I might be
killed by him before I even draw my sword.

09:46.836 --> 09:49.380
If after investigation it turns out it was the PR office's fault

09:49.880 --> 09:52.216
I'm going to let Zheng Shouhuan
take the position of head of the strategy department.

09:52.300 --> 09:55.678
Then you will be kicked out immediately
and become a beggar on the street.

09:55.761 --> 09:58.556
Not only you and me,
but also what is the name of that employee?

09:59.348 --> 10:00.975
That's Park Yoon-so

10:11.777 --> 10:13.237
That, Agent Park

10:15.364 --> 10:17.742
How do you plan to write the report?

10:18.993 --> 10:21.495
Will you write it truthfully?

10:25.207 --> 10:26.417
Otherwise, how do you want me to write it?

10:28.669 --> 10:31.255
How should I write it?
You say it, I will write it as you say

10:36.719 --> 10:37.553

(Affiliation: Business Strategy Headquarters
Department: Public Relations Group 3, Position: Agent)

10:39.680 --> 10:40.848
focus a little

10:40.931 --> 10:41.974
(Se Yong)

10:46.729 --> 10:48.439
Protein powder raw material supplier?

10:48.898 --> 10:49.774
right

10:49.857 --> 10:51.817
Did you upgrade the formula after changing suppliers?

10:51.901 --> 10:53.444
The previous supplier was Dongxin, right?

10:54.070 --> 10:56.364
But I can't find information about the new supplier

10:56.739 --> 10:58.240
I heard it is a supplier called PF

10:58.324 --> 11:00.159
But I can't find the address of the factory

11:00.242 --> 11:01.160
I'm not sure about this

11:01.744 --> 11:02.828
What?

11:03.913 --> 11:06.290
Aren't you the factory director? How could you not know?

11:06.374 --> 11:08.042
That's handled by the head office.

11:08.125 --> 11:10.544
Team leader Zhao said it was decided by the superiors.

11:10.628 --> 11:12.588
We are just collecting raw materials here

11:12.672 --> 11:13.756
(Whey protein isolate, produced in Denmark)

11:16.884 --> 11:18.094
What about quality assurance?

11:18.678 --> 11:21.055
That's what Team Leader Zhao is handling too.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.477
Previous supplier Dongxin

11:27.937 --> 11:29.188
How are they doing now?

11:30.564 --> 11:31.816
Why do you ask this?

11:32.441 --> 11:33.943
I really do not know

11:34.276 --> 11:36.278
Does the public relations office even need to know these things?

11:38.072 --> 11:39.115
No

11:39.198 --> 11:40.324
I'm just curious

11:40.408 --> 11:41.575
Then forget it

11:47.623 --> 11:50.584
if there's anything else you want to tell me

11:50.668 --> 11:51.836
this is for you

12:38.841 --> 12:40.342
You haven't gotten off work yet

12:42.219 --> 12:43.095
sit down

12:45.139 --> 12:45.973
Alas

12:46.474 --> 12:47.641
What are you doing?

12:50.561 --> 12:51.979
did you drink?

12:52.730 --> 12:55.900
I only drink a little

12:55.983 --> 12:59.236
You should have gone home after drinking.
Why did you come back to the company again?

12:59.320 --> 13:00.738
this…

13:00.821 --> 13:02.656
Anyway, no one will greet me when I get home.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.826
My wife and kids...

13:06.285 --> 13:08.329
Do you know Perth, Australia?

13:08.412 --> 13:09.288
Perth

13:10.498 --> 13:11.832
they live there

13:13.751 --> 13:15.085
We are a pretty typical family, right?

13:15.961 --> 13:19.340
But they would move there
not for their children’s studies.

13:20.090 --> 13:22.092
It's because the child's
atopic dermatitis is too severe

13:22.885 --> 13:25.679
They seemed happy to be able to live in that kind of place.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.643
You didn't ask that, right?

13:31.644 --> 13:33.479
Recently, everyone says that this kind of behavior is called talking too much.

13:35.981 --> 13:39.068
But what do you want from me?

13:42.154 --> 13:44.740
I don’t think I saw Team Leader Chi this afternoon.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.159
She went out to work

13:47.535 --> 13:49.537
She said she would get off work directly after it was over

13:51.038 --> 13:52.289
It turns out she ran away

13:55.751 --> 13:56.877
so what?

13:58.587 --> 14:00.673
How do you plan to write the report?

14:04.885 --> 14:08.722
No matter how you write it,
it will be a blow to Director Goo

14:09.223 --> 14:13.727
It feels like
we gave our boss an uppercut

14:14.144 --> 14:15.187
Why does the Council…

14:15.312 --> 14:18.440
Because some people are eagerly waiting
for Director Goo to step down.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.818
Those people are waiting for an opportunity

14:21.944 --> 14:23.779
Keep an eye on her

14:28.617 --> 14:29.702
that…

14:29.785 --> 14:31.161
let me tell you

14:32.913 --> 14:35.291
I'll give you some advice while you're drunk.

14:36.750 --> 14:37.751
You just…

14:39.879 --> 14:41.630
Just think about yourself

14:42.548 --> 14:43.382
because

14:43.465 --> 14:45.092
No one will help you at all

14:45.175 --> 14:46.093
so

14:46.844 --> 14:48.012
Just protect yourself

14:53.434 --> 14:55.728
I'll figure it out myself

15:46.445 --> 15:47.613

15:47.696 --> 15:49.281
Tea? Or coffee?

15:49.865 --> 15:50.908
What?

15:51.617 --> 15:52.785
How are you?

15:53.953 --> 15:56.121
Not good, not good at all

15:56.789 --> 15:58.165
I'm just hanging on

16:08.384 --> 16:09.593
Want to make instant coffee for you?

16:10.177 --> 16:11.428
Would you like something sweet?

16:11.762 --> 16:12.680
OK

16:16.183 --> 16:17.059
Come

16:30.489 --> 16:31.490

I should have been with you

16:40.958 --> 16:42.835
what can I do for you?

16:47.589 --> 16:48.716
Then lend it to me for a while.

16:49.299 --> 16:50.843
Just lend it to me for a while

17:00.769 --> 17:04.565
I want to write a report but I don’t know how to write it

17:05.983 --> 17:08.485
Leader Song told me about this just now

17:09.111 --> 17:10.779
It will also deal a blow to Director Goo

17:12.448 --> 17:13.824
I'm also worried about our group

17:17.077 --> 17:18.078
You now

17:19.371 --> 17:20.914
Don't worry, Director Goo

17:21.915 --> 17:23.584
Don't worry about your group either.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.211
Just think about yourself

17:27.212 --> 17:28.589
It doesn't matter if it's a little selfish

17:29.339 --> 17:30.632
Be stronger

17:45.898 --> 17:47.149
you…

17:49.026 --> 17:50.152
Have you had dinner yet?

17:50.569 --> 17:51.737
Have you got a meal yet?

17:52.112 --> 17:54.364
Not yet, what's wrong? Do you want a treat?

17:55.532 --> 17:56.617
Why should I invite you?

17:57.576 --> 17:59.411
It's not like you're not making money

18:00.370 --> 18:03.207
If you don't want a treat, then get out of here

18:12.633 --> 18:15.469
(Se Yong)

18:18.931 --> 18:20.140
Hello

18:20.224 --> 18:21.809
Hello

18:27.648 --> 18:29.066
That, Director Goo

18:29.733 --> 18:30.609
What's up?

18:32.027 --> 18:33.821
Here's what I think

18:34.947 --> 18:37.241
consider your position

18:37.866 --> 18:41.662
The internal culture improvement plan you are driving now

18:42.246 --> 18:44.665
Is it too much?

18:47.918 --> 18:48.877
Why do you say that?

18:48.961 --> 18:51.505
No, I'm just worried

18:51.588 --> 18:56.093
You seem to have too much time to take care of yourself now

18:56.176 --> 18:59.930
Such a flashy plan

19:00.722 --> 19:04.184
From the company's perspective, it's just spending money in vain
with no benefit at all.

19:04.268 --> 19:06.520
-Room Chief-
Just give up now

19:06.603 --> 19:08.939
- I will not be embarrassed
- Director Chen

19:09.690 --> 19:10.607
What's up?

19:10.691 --> 19:13.986
I'm not too busy to take care of myself now

19:15.070 --> 19:17.030
Thank you for worrying about me so much

19:17.114 --> 19:19.116
But internal culture improvement plans will continue

19:19.783 --> 19:21.618
If it makes you unhappy, then I apologize

19:22.286 --> 19:25.873
I didn’t expect you to be so ignorant
of the significance of the internal culture improvement plan.

19:25.956 --> 19:27.916
i feel very disappointed

19:29.293 --> 19:31.670
You said this plan only costs money
and does no good at all?

19:31.753 --> 19:34.047
What is your so-called company’s position?

19:34.673 --> 19:35.549
good

19:36.049 --> 19:38.969
What position are you referring to?

19:39.428 --> 19:41.763
I'm just worried

19:41.847 --> 19:45.559
Then you should
lead the internal culture improvement plan.

19:45.642 --> 19:48.145
That's not what I should do

19:48.770 --> 19:49.605
good

19:50.272 --> 19:51.148
I see

19:51.231 --> 19:52.691
Then Director Chen

19:53.609 --> 19:56.195
Please don't do anything

19:57.070 --> 20:01.450
I'll take the lead, you don't have to do anything

20:01.533 --> 20:02.618
Understand?

20:19.218 --> 20:20.219
Chief

20:20.302 --> 20:21.428
how?

20:21.511 --> 20:25.807
It's not like I said something I shouldn't have said
, and I'm qualified to say that.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.309
Who knows?

20:27.392 --> 20:28.393
if

20:28.894 --> 20:30.979
I really became the head of the Strategy Headquarters

20:31.063 --> 20:34.900
Maybe the situation will turn around

20:47.704 --> 20:48.580
hateful

20:48.664 --> 20:49.915
What did you just say?

20:51.208 --> 20:52.292
you bastard

20:52.376 --> 20:55.128
Hey, do you think it’s fair to say that the sales team didn’t know anything?

20:56.338 --> 20:58.465
Senior, please sit down first and then talk

20:58.548 --> 20:59.549
- Sit down first.
- Let go, you brat.

21:01.593 --> 21:03.845
Otherwise, do you want us to die together?

21:03.929 --> 21:06.598
We are just acting according to the plan proposed by the public relations office.

21:06.682 --> 21:07.891
Oh my god

21:07.975 --> 21:08.850
Hello

21:09.268 --> 21:11.228
What did you say in the beginning?

21:11.311 --> 21:13.230
Have you ever said that you want to target

21:13.313 --> 21:14.690
Already listed high-protein companies to start?

21:15.148 --> 21:18.026
That's how newbies like us who know nothing
do things like that, you brats!

21:18.110 --> 21:20.487
There's a bit of a misunderstanding here

21:20.570 --> 21:22.572
We could have proposed it

21:22.656 --> 21:25.200
But it is up to the PR team to decide what approach to take

21:25.284 --> 21:26.118
Yeah?

21:26.201 --> 21:28.328
So you’re going to do this trick now?

21:28.537 --> 21:30.956
- I really want to hit you
- So just leave it alone.

21:31.039 --> 21:32.416
The main ones are three groups.

21:32.499 --> 21:33.709
That's Leader Chi's business

21:33.792 --> 21:35.961
Why are you more excited than them?

21:36.044 --> 21:38.422
There's no need for everyone to die together,
right?

21:38.505 --> 21:40.257
You... Hey, Zhenrui

21:40.340 --> 21:41.466
Yes, senior

21:42.884 --> 21:45.387
I'm telling you, that's not how the PR team works.

21:45.470 --> 21:51.184
We are not like your business groups
who are divided into different groups just to compete with each other.

21:51.268 --> 21:54.104
Our Digital PR Team and News Media Team

21:54.187 --> 21:58.233
Like gears
that have to fit together to work, you bastard

21:58.608 --> 21:59.609
Do you understand?

22:00.360 --> 22:02.279
We're in this together, brat

22:02.404 --> 22:04.865
But there is still a person in charge, so just leave it alone.

22:04.948 --> 22:06.742
Zhao Zhenrui, you stinky boy

22:09.786 --> 22:13.290
You eat these and then leave
to feed them. Take this by the way.

22:16.126 --> 22:17.836
senior

22:20.756 --> 22:21.673
Chi Hyo

22:34.019 --> 22:35.645
Please take a look at this too

22:37.189 --> 22:39.441
I changed the design a little bit

22:50.369 --> 22:51.370
Are you going home?

22:51.453 --> 22:52.537
Want to give you a lift?

22:53.705 --> 22:54.664
up to you

22:59.503 --> 23:01.046
It seems you can't write it yet

23:03.632 --> 23:05.425
Let's go to dinner, I'll treat you

23:07.928 --> 23:08.762
What's wrong with you?

23:08.845 --> 23:11.264
I see you have been pulling your hair just now

23:11.807 --> 23:13.058
Go get some nutrition

23:16.186 --> 23:17.354
What do you want to eat?

23:17.687 --> 23:19.606
Ginseng chicken soup? eel?

23:20.148 --> 23:21.400
Or raw beef?

23:22.818 --> 23:24.736
It's really hard for me to treat you to dinner

23:24.986 --> 23:28.115
So you don’t have to be polite and
try to choose the more expensive one, understand?

23:29.991 --> 23:31.201
I want to eat roasted pork rinds

23:31.785 --> 23:34.079
Hey, you can eat that kind of thing anytime

23:34.162 --> 23:35.205
I want to eat roasted pork rinds

23:35.997 --> 23:37.749
Let's go to that store

23:37.833 --> 23:39.835
A famous roasted pork rind restaurant that only company bosses go to.

23:39.918 --> 23:41.253
Let's go eat too

23:41.336 --> 23:44.047
Hey, it's a different matter if you go to that place.

23:44.131 --> 23:45.298
good

23:50.053 --> 23:51.138
Yes, represents

23:52.222 --> 23:53.098
yes

23:54.516 --> 23:55.392
I'm fine

23:56.685 --> 23:57.727
real

23:58.019 --> 23:59.020
good

24:00.230 --> 24:01.565
Are you talking about Representative Xu?

24:01.731 --> 24:04.734
So is he still in the company?

24:06.987 --> 24:08.530
Okay, I'll do my best too

24:09.865 --> 24:10.782
goodbye

24:16.163 --> 24:19.082
Jae Min, I'm sorry, let's go eat there next time

24:21.585 --> 24:23.003
Do you want to go to Global Broadcast?

24:24.171 --> 24:26.715
Is Representative Xu there?

24:27.424 --> 24:31.094
I heard he was working overtime all night to save Ang's bakery.

24:31.344 --> 24:33.346
It seems better if I go there to buy something.

24:34.723 --> 24:37.350
Just let me get off the bus in front. I'll take a taxi there.

24:37.976 --> 24:40.770
Hey, I've already driven you here,
why are you taking a taxi? Just let me drive you

24:41.480 --> 24:42.939
But it's the opposite direction

24:43.523 --> 24:44.357
yes

24:44.441 --> 24:46.151
Is my friend a good person?

25:01.583 --> 25:02.709
Come

25:03.376 --> 25:05.337
You don't have to buy these

25:05.420 --> 25:07.339
Didn’t I tell you to replenish your body?

25:07.756 --> 25:09.090
This eel sushi is delicious

25:09.174 --> 25:12.219
I just feel like I'm very grateful to you.
After all, I let you fly for dinner.

25:13.762 --> 25:14.763
I also bought my share.

25:17.140 --> 25:17.974
You go in quickly

25:19.100 --> 25:21.269
Okay, then I'm leaving

25:28.902 --> 25:29.903
goodbye

25:44.167 --> 25:45.210
Well, Jacob

25:45.710 --> 25:49.381
Thank you for letting us photograph your company's facilities

25:50.298 --> 25:51.132
of course

25:51.424 --> 25:54.719
High protein bread for our main customers

25:54.803 --> 25:57.472
Is using your company’s products

25:58.014 --> 25:59.432
So we can…

26:00.725 --> 26:04.271
Emphasize the high quality of your company’s ingredients

26:04.729 --> 26:09.317
OK, I will send you the final version before publishing it.

26:09.776 --> 26:11.194
Thanks, bye

26:13.113 --> 26:14.030
You are here

26:14.114 --> 26:14.948
Representative Xu

26:16.324 --> 26:19.536
Ang's Bakery uses ingredients
that are the UK's number one highest in protein

26:19.995 --> 26:23.623
So I contacted the local shooting team
and planned to shoot a video and put it on the video platform

26:23.707 --> 26:27.877
It is also expected to upload
an introductory article about the product’s history, taste and quality.

26:28.545 --> 26:31.548
This is how we plan to
save Ang's bakery

26:31.673 --> 26:35.385
Hope this can help you too

26:35.468 --> 26:36.720
Thank you

26:37.053 --> 26:39.055
Is there anything I can do to help?

26:39.139 --> 26:40.765
let me see…

26:41.266 --> 26:42.392
(eel sushi)

26:42.475 --> 26:43.602
The food in this restaurant is delicious

26:43.685 --> 26:44.644
Let's eat first and then talk

26:45.228 --> 26:46.646
You haven't had your meal yet?

26:46.730 --> 26:47.606
yes

26:47.856 --> 26:49.899
No wonder my stomach keeps pounding

26:50.066 --> 26:51.234
So hungry

27:03.913 --> 27:05.874
Yun Zhao, are you full?

27:06.124 --> 27:07.125
right

27:07.250 --> 27:08.251
Then I can...

27:08.335 --> 27:09.419
OK, you eat it

27:09.502 --> 27:10.462
good

27:27.854 --> 27:29.272
(Ang’s Bakery)

27:29.564 --> 27:31.566
(Zhang bento full of mother’s sincerity)

27:32.192 --> 27:33.360
Representative Xu

27:43.119 --> 27:44.996
Just say it after you have eaten.

27:46.081 --> 27:50.960
No, I have a bigger stomach,
so I eat twice as much as others.

27:51.044 --> 27:52.087
You do not know?

28:03.390 --> 28:04.557
your body is in denial

28:05.642 --> 28:07.852
But that's what I thought

28:07.936 --> 28:10.313
I'll eat with you, as much as you want

28:15.402 --> 28:17.946
But you'd better not eat any more

28:19.197 --> 28:20.615
OK, I won't eat

28:31.084 --> 28:33.420
Hey, you really don’t want to eat?

28:33.503 --> 28:35.547
I don't like eating eels, it's disgusting

28:35.630 --> 28:38.341
So why should you buy it?
You probably don't want to buy me something to eat.

28:38.717 --> 28:39.801
bingo

28:40.468 --> 28:41.886
I just want to buy you something to eat

28:42.679 --> 28:43.930
Still pretending

28:44.431 --> 28:45.515
Anyway, thank you

28:47.517 --> 28:49.811
what is that? Why do you take it so seriously?

28:51.104 --> 28:52.856
These two are the same product

28:52.939 --> 28:54.149
But the ingredient analysis table is different

28:54.232 --> 28:55.275
What?

28:55.358 --> 28:56.484
(Ingredient analysis table)

28:56.568 --> 28:58.319
This means one of them is fake

28:59.154 --> 29:00.238
what are you talking about?

29:04.367 --> 29:05.326
Hello

29:06.119 --> 29:08.204
Where have all the previous guests gone?

29:10.415 --> 29:11.416
have no idea

29:11.666 --> 29:12.917
There is a channel owner with millions of subscribers

29:13.001 --> 29:14.335
Gave a very negative review

29:14.711 --> 29:16.838
Said this is a boring place that makes you want to vomit

29:18.339 --> 29:20.049
I guess that’s life, right?

29:20.592 --> 29:22.844
If there is an uphill slope, there will be a downhill slope.

29:26.681 --> 29:27.682
Hello

29:27.766 --> 29:29.601
The tears you shed seem to be full of blood

29:29.851 --> 29:30.894
Right?

29:39.944 --> 29:41.070
Hello? I'm Yoo Jae-min

29:43.072 --> 29:44.532
Hello, factory manager

29:46.534 --> 29:48.369
Yes, please wait a moment

29:55.460 --> 29:56.461
-
Hello

30:00.215 --> 30:03.134
You're bored without any guests.
Would you like me to make you a cocktail?

30:03.968 --> 30:05.220
Can you make cocktails?

30:05.303 --> 30:08.056
Don't look at me like this.
I used to be a part-time cocktail maker.

30:08.598 --> 30:12.769
Although the boss later handed over the store to me and left,
leaving me unable to show my talents.

30:41.798 --> 30:44.300
I usually wait in front of someone else’s house.

30:44.592 --> 30:47.220
Either a lover who is currently dating or a lover who has broken up.

30:48.513 --> 30:49.889
How is it here?

30:50.181 --> 30:52.559
Why is it so messy and scary?

30:54.727 --> 30:56.145
Because this place is about to be rebuilt

30:57.856 --> 30:59.941
So didn’t I tell you not to come here?

31:00.024 --> 31:01.818
You forced yourself to come here

31:02.652 --> 31:05.530
Because I feel really depressed

31:05.613 --> 31:08.116
Depressed to the point of going crazy

31:10.285 --> 31:13.496
Even after drinking, I still feel scared all the time

31:15.790 --> 31:17.083
Sister Yunzhao, wouldn't you do this?

31:18.668 --> 31:19.752
"Sister Yun Zhao"?

31:20.920 --> 31:22.755
Did you just call me sister?

31:23.047 --> 31:25.758
Yes, I really want to call you that now

31:27.635 --> 31:29.095
Okay, please do as you please

31:33.933 --> 31:34.934
me

31:35.768 --> 31:37.687
I went to the hospital today

31:38.605 --> 31:41.816
This is the boss mentioned in the message board article

31:42.233 --> 31:43.651
The one in hospital

31:45.069 --> 31:46.821
I heard his condition is very bad

31:49.782 --> 31:51.701
So you went to see him?

31:52.285 --> 31:53.536
I haven't gone yet

31:55.788 --> 31:56.623
what do I do?

31:59.584 --> 32:00.418
I…

32:01.085 --> 32:03.713
I really just want to perform well

32:03.796 --> 32:06.674
You are very proud of yourself in the company

32:06.758 --> 32:09.052
Discuss with the two team leaders over there

32:10.053 --> 32:12.013
Makes me feel jealous

32:13.890 --> 32:14.974
so

32:15.058 --> 32:17.060
I think I can do it too

32:17.143 --> 32:20.647
I want to hear others say that even though I am just a newcomer

32:21.564 --> 32:23.316
But really capable

32:24.484 --> 32:27.236
But I really didn't expect it to be like this

32:27.320 --> 32:28.404
I mean it

32:38.206 --> 32:39.499
Sister Yun Zhao

32:45.588 --> 32:46.923
what do I do?

33:15.660 --> 33:16.869
Where did Agent Park go?

33:18.746 --> 33:19.956
In the director's office

33:20.456 --> 33:22.000
(report)

33:27.296 --> 33:29.215
(I am the person in charge of online promotion of Senteng 100 high protein milkshake
)

33:29.298 --> 33:30.800
(Solely determines and conducts all viral marketing)

33:34.387 --> 33:37.098
Do you think this is the most efficient method?

33:37.598 --> 33:38.599
Negative marketing tactics?

33:39.976 --> 33:42.270
- Right
- Isn't that your own popular product?

33:43.146 --> 33:46.065
Because now the place where I belong is Seyong

33:49.152 --> 33:51.320
Then you should know better than anyone else

33:51.404 --> 33:53.448
Products that are popular on social platforms

33:53.531 --> 33:56.117
How easy it is to ruin something using social platforms

33:57.744 --> 33:58.745
right

34:02.957 --> 34:04.500
Did you report to the team leader?

34:06.252 --> 34:08.671
- No
- The team leader didn't know?

34:09.964 --> 34:14.135
She gave me full authority
so I didn't report to her again.

34:19.557 --> 34:23.186
Is this what you did at Cao Ya Public Relations?

34:25.104 --> 34:27.940
Is this Park Yoon-soo's way of doing things?

34:36.365 --> 34:38.451
It seems I saw the wrong person

34:39.494 --> 34:40.703
I understand

34:40.828 --> 34:42.288
you can go out

34:52.673 --> 34:53.633
you temporarily

34:55.093 --> 34:57.178
Put down all business

34:57.261 --> 34:58.763
Stop working and reflect.

35:01.557 --> 35:02.391
OK

35:08.397 --> 35:10.900
Director Goo, we are going in.

35:12.652 --> 35:15.363
I haven't reported it to the director yet
. I'm embarrassed by your behavior.

35:15.446 --> 35:16.697
You report to her now

35:16.781 --> 35:18.199
I told you not to do this

35:18.282 --> 35:19.408
It doesn't matter

35:24.789 --> 35:25.706
Hello

35:26.749 --> 35:28.042
Is there a problem?

35:29.585 --> 35:31.254
The promotion of protein powder this time

35:31.337 --> 35:34.549
This is a promotional method that Seyong has used many times before.

35:35.174 --> 35:39.262
Yes, after operating on social platforms,
our PR Team 2 will send the news to the media

35:39.345 --> 35:41.097
reuse news

35:41.180 --> 35:43.683
Promote on social platforms

35:43.891 --> 35:46.811
This is something Park cannot do alone.

35:48.354 --> 35:51.566
I also think that the third PR team should not be held responsible.

35:52.108 --> 35:54.360
You mean this is the responsibility of the entire PR office?

35:54.443 --> 35:55.319
right

35:55.403 --> 35:56.904
But it’s not just the PR office

35:57.446 --> 35:59.740
The sales team should also be responsible

36:00.575 --> 36:02.827
We've had dozens of meetings together

36:03.119 --> 36:08.583
Their position is that no matter what method is used
, as long as the product can be sold well

36:09.041 --> 36:10.418
as you said

36:10.501 --> 36:11.419
This is fake

36:11.878 --> 36:13.004
Yes, that's right

36:13.713 --> 36:16.048
But the custom here is to do this kind of thing

36:16.132 --> 36:17.675
It's no big deal

36:17.758 --> 36:18.968
That's how Shi Rong is

36:19.051 --> 36:22.138
I'm not saying that the PR team is not at fault.

36:22.221 --> 36:23.306
only

36:23.723 --> 36:27.101
I'd say it's not just the PR team's fault.

36:27.935 --> 36:28.936
that

36:29.770 --> 36:32.648
Regarding the overall low moral sense of the company

36:32.732 --> 36:34.150
I deeply agree

36:34.233 --> 36:35.526
About this time

36:35.610 --> 36:38.362
The new person in charge of the case and her superior agent

36:38.446 --> 36:42.033
As well as the team leader responsible for supervision
, the public relations office and the sales team

36:42.116 --> 36:44.869
Everyone should apologize and take responsibility

36:44.952 --> 36:48.915
I don't think any one person should be responsible

36:49.040 --> 36:50.875
No matter that person is Agent Park

36:51.417 --> 36:53.419
still you

37:08.935 --> 37:09.810
Team leader

37:11.729 --> 37:14.857
When I came back from the team leader meeting,
I didn't expect that you were already there.

37:15.399 --> 37:18.527
This is fraud, it's all lies

37:19.862 --> 37:20.780
anyway

37:21.614 --> 37:24.492
You were really loyal and
said it was all your own doing.

37:25.993 --> 37:27.286
If it happens to our group

37:27.370 --> 37:29.372
They will definitely say that it was me who instigated it.

37:29.455 --> 37:30.790
because that's the truth

37:31.666 --> 37:35.044
Why do you want to ruin such a beautiful atmosphere?

37:35.336 --> 37:37.463
But where did Team Leader Cui go?

37:37.546 --> 37:40.466
He said he was nervous

37:41.133 --> 37:42.802
Got diarrhea

37:43.386 --> 37:45.346
He is really unhelpful at all.

37:47.431 --> 37:48.766
I was so moved that I wanted to cry

37:49.350 --> 37:51.727
The team leaders all came to help me speak.

37:53.229 --> 37:54.563
They are so loyal

37:54.939 --> 37:55.773
Too

37:56.232 --> 37:58.150
This is what the public relations teams of large companies all do.

37:58.234 --> 38:00.236
The people in the group are like brothers and sisters

38:01.612 --> 38:03.489
I always feel

38:03.572 --> 38:06.492
I'm incompatible with their kind of relationship.

38:07.076 --> 38:07.994
but

38:08.619 --> 38:11.789
Today I feel like
I belong there too

38:12.707 --> 38:14.959
I am grateful to those who have helped me

38:15.876 --> 38:17.336
especially you

38:18.045 --> 38:21.299
You helped me a lot this time

38:21.382 --> 38:24.844
It gave me courage and gave me a lot of support

38:25.970 --> 38:28.597
You don't have to be so grateful

38:29.557 --> 38:30.391
because

38:31.976 --> 38:35.646
You behave well and are a good person so
everyone will help you

38:40.109 --> 38:41.319
Thanks

38:47.658 --> 38:49.577
I didn’t see you in the office today either

38:51.037 --> 38:51.912
Where are you?

38:52.913 --> 38:54.832
Golf driving range? Why go there?

38:56.083 --> 38:58.210
I don't know why I'm here either

38:59.295 --> 39:02.840
The actual owner of the PF factory
is the owner of this golf driving range

39:03.591 --> 39:05.051
But I didn't see him all day

39:06.427 --> 39:08.804
what does it mean? PF factory?

39:09.263 --> 39:10.306
PF？

39:12.058 --> 39:13.476
"Pat Leightford"

39:13.559 --> 39:15.061
Raw material supplier of Serong Protein Powder?

39:16.062 --> 39:16.896
you know?

39:16.979 --> 39:20.858
I remember the name of the company because it was Pirate Food.

39:20.941 --> 39:23.736
I mean, changing your name is too casual, right?

39:23.819 --> 39:24.862
Hello, Team Leader Ko Dong-kyun

39:24.945 --> 39:25.905
so what?

39:25.988 --> 39:28.032
- You're here.
- What are you doing there?

39:29.325 --> 39:30.493
haven't seen you for a long time

39:30.576 --> 39:31.702
-
Hello

39:33.204 --> 39:34.372
Hey, wait a minute

39:38.250 --> 39:39.251
Team Leader Gao

39:40.294 --> 39:41.379
Agent Liu

39:42.505 --> 39:43.631
Please go in first

39:46.425 --> 39:47.885
Are you playing golf too?

39:50.554 --> 39:52.807
Do you come to this golf driving range often?

39:53.057 --> 39:56.102
Is this place run by Team Leader Zhao’s brother-in-law or brother-in-law?

39:57.103 --> 39:58.729
Team leader Cho Jin-seo of the medical care team?

39:59.313 --> 40:01.232
Yes, this is close to my home, so I come here often

40:01.315 --> 40:03.484
You also know that Team Leader Zhao is the king of matchmaking.

40:04.693 --> 40:06.487
If I want to please him, of course I have to come often.

40:07.571 --> 40:09.448
Yes, that's right

40:09.990 --> 40:11.033
You are so ignorant

40:11.617 --> 40:12.827
That you're busy

40:13.369 --> 40:14.245
good

40:19.458 --> 40:20.292
Hello? Feel sorry

40:20.376 --> 40:24.296
Is Team Leader Zhao’s brother-in-law or brother-in-law the boss of PF?

40:24.380 --> 40:25.506
It seems so

40:25.589 --> 40:27.758
- What are you doing?
- Talk to you later

40:27.842 --> 40:29.009
I'll tell you everything later

40:29.802 --> 40:30.886
I'll close the line first

40:54.368 --> 40:55.536
Hello, Li Haizhao

41:05.421 --> 41:06.464
pick it up

41:07.131 --> 41:10.009
Don't throw away cigarette butts, pick them up

41:12.803 --> 41:13.679
I asked you to pick it up

41:19.268 --> 41:20.144
Is that okay?

41:21.437 --> 41:22.480
where are you going?

41:27.818 --> 41:28.694
I don't want to go home

41:30.613 --> 41:32.072
Damn it, that guy is here again

41:32.156 --> 41:34.867
Wearing weird pajamas and going crazy with mom

41:36.118 --> 41:37.161
Really annoying

41:39.413 --> 41:40.915
Can't we move out?

41:41.832 --> 41:43.083
Are you making money?

41:43.167 --> 41:44.668
We live separately from my mother

41:48.339 --> 41:49.423
how?

41:50.007 --> 41:51.425
Don't you want to live with me?

41:54.762 --> 41:56.305
Don't sleep at a friend's house

41:56.388 --> 41:59.099
You must come back tonight
or send me a message

42:10.319 --> 42:11.403
Brother Zhejun

42:16.325 --> 42:18.536
- What's wrong?
- Why did you come out so slowly?

42:18.619 --> 42:20.329
Wait, let's go outside and talk

42:20.412 --> 42:21.330
- Why?
- let's go

42:25.042 --> 42:26.252
What else are you doing? Come here quickly

42:26.335 --> 42:27.211
that…

42:27.294 --> 42:28.629
- What?
- Those things

42:28.712 --> 42:30.589
What? There's nothing, let's go

42:31.298 --> 42:34.510
(Amino acid score of Senteng 100 high protein milkshake
: 64 points)

42:37.680 --> 42:38.722
Are you dating?

42:39.265 --> 42:40.099
my ex-wife

42:40.182 --> 42:41.267
What?

42:41.350 --> 42:44.061
The ingredient analysis table given by Team Leader Song is fake

42:44.812 --> 42:45.688
right

42:46.981 --> 42:49.400
The ingredient analysis table I commissioned from another research institute

42:49.984 --> 42:51.318
Shows that it does not meet the standards of the Food and Drug Administration

42:51.402 --> 42:53.362
I also visited the factory today

42:53.821 --> 42:56.490
The actual situation is so bad that there is no quality assurance under normal procedures.

42:56.574 --> 42:58.284
But that manufacturer

42:59.076 --> 43:00.661
Are you a relative of Team Leader Zhao?

43:01.662 --> 43:02.871
Hello, Team Zhao...

43:05.791 --> 43:07.835
Can Team Leader Zhao do such a thing by himself?

43:07.918 --> 43:09.128
Absolutely impossible

43:09.211 --> 43:11.088
So which level is involved?

43:11.463 --> 43:12.631
Team leader Song is 100% involved

43:13.007 --> 43:14.258
Plus…

43:14.633 --> 43:16.343
Any more? What else?

43:19.263 --> 43:22.391
The former supplier's boss passed away unexpectedly last month.

43:24.435 --> 43:28.689
Because we changed the supplier,
the boss gave up on himself and drank all day long...

43:28.981 --> 43:30.149
do not talk

43:35.779 --> 43:38.240
Only you know about this, right?

43:38.657 --> 43:41.035
If this matter spreads, our world...

43:43.245 --> 43:46.123
It’s really going to be doomed, you know?

43:47.916 --> 43:50.544
(Se Yong)

44:08.228 --> 44:11.857
I hope the internal culture improvement program
can be accelerated

44:14.860 --> 44:16.570
The current plan is temporarily suspended

44:18.697 --> 44:19.573
Why?

44:23.535 --> 44:25.079
This is an instruction from above

44:29.792 --> 44:30.918
Start over

44:32.419 --> 44:35.547
- Okay
- Regarding the internal culture improvement plan in the future

44:35.631 --> 44:37.675
Just follow my instructions

44:37.758 --> 44:40.052
No matter what anyone above says, ignore it.

44:41.887 --> 44:42.930
OK

44:47.142 --> 44:48.977
Even if I have to leave this company

44:49.311 --> 44:51.480
I will also do a complete employee survey

44:51.563 --> 44:53.816
Make improvement plans before leaving

44:54.233 --> 44:55.067

45:22.845 --> 45:23.887
How was the report?

45:23.971 --> 45:26.515
After putting more emphasis on the vendor selection process

45:26.598 --> 45:28.225
Just send it out again

45:28.308 --> 45:29.977
- I understand, okay.
- Thank you for your hard work.

45:38.444 --> 45:39.445
Please enjoy

45:40.738 --> 45:41.613
Feel sorry

45:42.573 --> 45:44.491
I didn't mean to see it

45:45.117 --> 45:47.369
But after seeing it, I couldn’t ignore it

45:48.245 --> 45:50.372
After I read the ingredient analysis table of protein powder,

45:50.664 --> 45:52.541
Just dig into this matter with Senior Ma

45:53.584 --> 45:55.252
I want to remind you to be prepared

45:59.089 --> 46:00.090
The news will be reported soon

46:04.052 --> 46:05.763
maybe that's a good thing

46:06.889 --> 46:08.766
Pus is going to flow out

Only then will everyone know that the suppuration is so serious

46:36.502 --> 46:37.628
- Nice to see you again
- Nice to see you

46:37.711 --> 46:38.879
It’s been a long time since the last forum

46:38.962 --> 46:40.047
Yes, that's right

so nice to see you again

Alas, Representative Lin

Hello, minister

46:55.687 --> 46:57.648
- Nice to see you here
- Me too

46:58.690 --> 47:00.400
I've heard a lot of news

47:00.901 --> 47:05.447
When you think of corporate sustainability in the future,
will you think of Shi Rong?

47:05.531 --> 47:10.828
That’s why I hired an expert in corporate sustainability
to serve as chief public relations officer.

47:11.036 --> 47:12.663
- I'm Goo Yi Jung
- I know

47:12.746 --> 47:15.749
She is a well-known figure in the field of corporate sustainability

47:17.125 --> 47:19.545
I saw a lot of big bosses coming

47:19.628 --> 47:22.422
I heard that the president of Macquarie International is going to give a keynote speech

47:22.506 --> 47:23.340
right

47:23.423 --> 47:25.801
Director Goo, you need to take a look at this

47:29.513 --> 47:31.223
(Is Shi Yong not related to the death of the boss of a certain outsourcing company ?)

47:33.100 --> 47:34.476
(This newspaper reported on the selection process of Serong’s raw material suppliers in July )

47:34.560 --> 47:35.602
(suspected of fraud)

47:38.188 --> 47:39.022
Representative Lin

47:40.023 --> 47:41.066
Representative Lin Zhixian

47:42.276 --> 47:43.443
What's up?

47:43.986 --> 47:44.987
Excuse me

47:46.071 --> 47:46.947
Representative, it's time for us to go.

47:47.030 --> 47:48.824
The problem of Shi Rong bullying others has been reported again

47:48.907 --> 47:50.659
How do you explain it?

47:50.742 --> 47:52.369
Do you really practice corporate sustainability well?

47:52.452 --> 47:53.996
Excuse me

47:54.079 --> 47:55.664
Minister, I'm sorry.

47:55.747 --> 47:57.499
- Let's go.
- Wait, Representative Lin.

47:57.583 --> 47:58.792
- Sorry
- Representative Lin

47:58.876 --> 47:59.751
Sorry, Secretary Kim.

47:59.835 --> 48:00.711
Representative Lin Zhixian!

48:01.461 --> 48:02.629
Representative Lin!

48:03.422 --> 48:04.715
Representative Lin Zhixian!

48:15.601 --> 48:16.643
It happens to be today

48:16.727 --> 48:18.270
It just happened to be today!

48:18.770 --> 48:20.522
It's really embarrassing and has been thrown to the whole world.

48:20.606 --> 48:22.733
I will investigate this matter thoroughly

48:23.191 --> 48:25.527
Do you have to keep your mouth shut?

48:25.736 --> 48:27.070
Nothing done at all?

48:27.404 --> 48:29.865
Are you going to always disappoint me like this?

48:30.365 --> 48:32.576
Don't rely too much on me as your backer.

48:32.659 --> 48:36.079
Because it may collapse overnight

48:43.629 --> 48:44.838
Go quickly!

48:52.971 --> 48:53.972
What are you doing?

48:54.556 --> 48:55.515
Did she leave you?

48:58.894 --> 48:59.937
Need a car?

49:00.312 --> 49:01.355
Do you want me to drive you?

49:01.438 --> 49:03.190
Just go your own way

49:03.273 --> 49:04.900
Don't make trouble

49:05.567 --> 49:07.694
It seems you are not as powerful as I thought

49:08.320 --> 49:09.279
so what?

49:09.738 --> 49:10.614
disappointed?

49:10.697 --> 49:13.700
No, I'm glad you're not that good

49:15.035 --> 49:16.161
I am leaving

49:32.970 --> 49:35.639
(Is Shi Yong not related to the death of the boss of a certain outsourcing company ?)

49:37.057 --> 49:39.101
(Reporter Choi Hye-young)

49:52.197 --> 49:54.324
Reporter Cui Huiying is your college classmate, right?

49:58.829 --> 50:00.205
Did you provide her with the information?

50:01.456 --> 50:03.250
How did she know this?

50:03.542 --> 50:05.168
Does this concern you?

50:11.341 --> 50:12.884
Can I ask you something?

50:12.968 --> 50:17.055
- Hello
- You have nothing to do with this?

50:18.306 --> 50:20.851
- What did you say?
- If you didn't hear, then I'll ask again.

50:20.934 --> 50:21.768
Team leader

50:22.936 --> 50:24.688
You and this protein powder incident

50:25.814 --> 50:27.482
No connection at all?

50:27.566 --> 50:29.943
What are you talking about?

50:30.235 --> 50:31.737
How dare you blur the focus?

50:31.820 --> 50:33.155
It's me asking you a question!

50:33.655 --> 50:35.991
Are you the source of reporter Choi Hye-young’s information?

50:40.162 --> 50:42.039
The source is indeed me

50:44.249 --> 50:45.375
Hello!

50:48.003 --> 50:48.962
you…

50:52.132 --> 50:54.051
You are from the public relations team of Se Yong

50:54.718 --> 50:57.596
You should be the first to stop this!

50:59.431 --> 51:00.724
I won't let you go

51:03.018 --> 51:04.019
Brace yourselves, you bastard

51:15.155 --> 51:17.824
Have you seen
people complaining about side effects of taking protein powder?

51:17.908 --> 51:19.409
Interviewed on TV?

51:20.577 --> 51:23.580
What is the purpose of the Se-yong Public Relations Office?

51:23.663 --> 51:26.374
You can't stop the news
and you can't clean up the mess.

51:26.625 --> 51:28.001
What to do now?

51:28.835 --> 51:29.753
The situation is very bad

51:30.462 --> 51:32.422
No, Team Leader Zhao...

51:38.095 --> 51:39.179
Director Chen

51:39.513 --> 51:40.347
yes

51:40.430 --> 51:42.933
You have been the head of the public relations office for decades

51:43.016 --> 51:44.976
You have a good mind

51:45.060 --> 51:47.771
Why do you think there is
a saying that "crisis is an opportunity"?

51:53.693 --> 51:55.403
I heard Team Leader Song say

51:56.321 --> 52:00.033
The reporter who wrote this story
is a friend of our PR office staff

52:01.409 --> 52:03.954
The source of the report comes from that employee

52:05.163 --> 52:09.167
Relate that employee to
an employee previously mentioned on the message board

52:09.251 --> 52:11.211
Let’s convene a personnel committee

52:12.003 --> 52:14.381
Since they made a mistake, we should hold them accountable

52:14.464 --> 52:16.591
It would be better if they could hand in their resignation letters.

52:17.092 --> 52:21.221
Put all the blame on the PR office?

52:23.431 --> 52:24.724
right

52:28.311 --> 52:29.521
nice

52:30.355 --> 52:34.442
Then let the chief
public relations officer, the head of the public relations office, be dismissed from his post.

52:34.526 --> 52:38.738
Then Representative Lin will naturally be hit hard.

52:39.030 --> 52:40.782
In this case

52:40.866 --> 52:44.244
We can stop hearing about
damn corporate sustainability for a while

52:47.247 --> 52:48.540
As expected

52:49.166 --> 52:52.127
The brilliant idea devised by the head of the future strategy headquarters

52:53.461 --> 52:58.466
If we strike first to gain strength,
Zheng Shouhuan will no longer be our opponent.

52:58.550 --> 52:59.509
Right?

53:00.385 --> 53:03.221
(Announcement on the second convening of the Personnel Committee)

53:03.763 --> 53:05.265
Personnel committee?

53:08.602 --> 53:12.522
Although it’s not a bad thing to get rid of the people below first...

53:22.532 --> 53:24.910
( The following personnel committee will be convened in accordance with Paragraph 3 of Article 10 of Serong Company Regulations )

53:24.993 --> 53:27.162
(Convening date: November 3, 2022.
Convening location: Large conference room on the third floor of the head office)

53:27.245 --> 53:28.955
(Targets: Yoo Jae-min, Public Relations Team 2
Park Yoon-so, Public Relations Team 3)

53:36.463 --> 53:37.505
(Personnel record sheet, name: Park Yun-soo)

53:38.089 --> 53:40.800
(Personnel record sheet, name: Liu Caimin)

54:03.031 --> 54:04.032
sit down

54:12.666 --> 54:14.084
Let's get started

54:16.711 --> 54:18.672
About PR Team 2 Agent Yoo Jae-min

54:18.755 --> 54:20.465
Acted by Park Yun-soo of PR Team 3

54:20.548 --> 54:22.342
The Personnel Committee will now be held

55:08.555 --> 55:10.557
