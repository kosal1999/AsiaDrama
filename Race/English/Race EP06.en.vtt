Two wins and one loss

00:41.041 --> 00:43.918
Characters, places and events are fictitious

00:45.003 --> 00:47.005
Yes, I'm almost home.

00:47.088 --> 00:48.256
Episode 6

00:48.339 --> 00:50.550
Today is a crazy day for you.

00:50.633 --> 00:51.634
Absolutely.

00:51.926 --> 00:54.095
I've been to heaven and hell.

00:54.679 --> 00:56.097
This is a busy company.

00:56.181 --> 00:58.641
I'm happy to have something
to work with.

00:59.809 --> 01:02.145
You are wonderful. There is no hope for you.

01:02.729 --> 01:05.732
-Who has it?
-Hey, I have a client. I have to go.

01:06.524 --> 01:08.234
nobody. Enter.

01:31.966 --> 01:33.760
-What?
-What are you doing in there?

01:33.843 --> 01:34.969
there is nothing. I rest.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.275
Why did you come up?

01:50.193 --> 01:51.569
Also rest.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.497
Are you too tired to even go to the elevator?

02:02.580 --> 02:03.414
Yes.

02:03.498 --> 02:04.791
Did you sell a lot?

02:05.750 --> 02:06.626
Yes.

02:08.461 --> 02:11.131
Then shouldn't you feel happy
and satisfied?

02:11.923 --> 02:13.925
I've dealt with a lot of people

02:14.008 --> 02:15.635
They sucked my energy.

02:16.594 --> 02:18.221
The more you sell, the more fatigue you get.

02:22.016 --> 02:22.892
You are fine.

02:25.103 --> 02:27.438
I need a man's hand, not yours.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.190
my God.

02:29.274 --> 02:32.861
Sweet and delicate touch.

02:32.944 --> 02:34.487
Don't do that.

02:35.321 --> 02:40.326
Someone said
my belly was fine and rubbed it.

02:40.410 --> 02:41.536
seriously.

02:44.664 --> 02:47.917
This is why you can't
be friends with your daughter.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.670
You can never talk to her about men.

02:50.753 --> 02:53.256
I don't want to be your friend either.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.426
Why this expression?

02:58.052 --> 02:59.137
Do I look tired?

02:59.220 --> 03:01.347
Why do you look like a zombie?

03:10.565 --> 03:11.399
Huajia.

03:11.482 --> 03:12.525
Yes.

03:13.318 --> 03:16.196
What should I do to make my boss like me?

03:19.157 --> 03:20.658
It's time for us to go now.

03:20.742 --> 03:22.702
She is on another level.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.787
Much taller than mine.

03:25.121 --> 03:26.456
But I want to make a lasting impression

03:26.539 --> 03:29.626
and get his approval.

03:30.084 --> 03:33.963
Come on, let's go.
I don't want to miss this drama.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.424
Can't you just listen to me for a minute?

03:36.507 --> 03:38.301
I pat your shoulder.

03:38.384 --> 03:42.055
I've never had a boss like this in my life

03:42.138 --> 03:43.640
So I don't know. View.

03:44.974 --> 03:47.644
OK let's go.

03:50.438 --> 03:52.357
cell movement

03:54.192 --> 03:55.318
Now you take care of it.

03:55.818 --> 03:57.654
It will be your responsibility,

03:57.737 --> 03:59.280
This proposal is made by you.

04:06.329 --> 04:07.497
Jaemin

04:07.580 --> 04:10.792
Yunzhu

04:20.468 --> 04:21.511
He didn't answer.

04:23.763 --> 04:24.764
Yunzhu

04:25.431 --> 04:27.350
call lost

04:27.433 --> 04:29.269
So will you stay here?

04:31.187 --> 04:32.021
Yes.

04:33.773 --> 04:35.316
Aren't you looking for a house?

04:39.654 --> 04:40.947
Why do you want to see me?

04:41.030 --> 04:42.991
I want to ask you something.

04:43.866 --> 04:45.868
Didn't you say you would never come back?

04:49.372 --> 04:50.331
Yes.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.377
So why…

04:55.253 --> 04:56.796
Why did you come back?

04:59.882 --> 05:02.260
It seems this is
what everyone wants to know.

05:02.343 --> 05:03.803
You don't seem to mean that.

05:04.387 --> 05:07.807
You act
like you're never coming back.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.899
So think of it as a gap year.

05:17.817 --> 05:20.820
You keep running. take a break.

05:20.903 --> 05:22.864
Look how things are going in South Korea.

05:22.947 --> 05:24.240
But why me?

05:28.077 --> 05:29.287
You even want to kneel down.

05:30.288 --> 05:31.664
Yes, sincerely.

05:33.374 --> 05:37.503
Most board members
are followers of the vice president,

05:37.587 --> 05:38.713
meaning is

05:39.213 --> 05:41.507
My position was not secure.

05:43.509 --> 05:46.846
Let ASG Consultants
serve as Communications Manager

05:46.929 --> 05:49.265
It will change the horizons of foreign investors
.

05:49.349 --> 05:53.353
This will give me the opportunity
to reorganize the Board of Governors.

05:53.436 --> 05:56.856
Who Can Object to Replacement of
Board Members

05:56.939 --> 05:58.441
Who knows ASG best?

06:02.820 --> 06:04.322
So you want to use me for this?

06:04.405 --> 06:06.866
To solidify your position as CEO?

06:08.117 --> 06:09.285
You want to be sincere.

06:10.828 --> 06:11.829
you are right.

06:12.413 --> 06:16.292
You just have to impress me
and stay with me.

06:19.003 --> 06:20.505
i want to take a rest

06:21.964 --> 06:23.341
And the condition is very good.

06:25.093 --> 06:26.219
I am disappointed.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.555
I didn't expect such a response.

06:33.142 --> 06:34.644
What response were you expecting?

06:55.373 --> 06:56.707
Because I want to see you?

06:58.459 --> 07:01.045
You are the reason I got into this field.

07:05.550 --> 07:06.634
official apology

07:06.717 --> 07:08.469
- Say hello to staff.
-excellent.

07:08.553 --> 07:10.304
Shiyong announces 2022 selection list

07:10.388 --> 07:14.350
Specializes in blindly recruiting
experienced workers.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.102
Our response was not adequate

07:16.185 --> 07:18.980
This led to the emergence of recruitment controversies
.

07:19.397 --> 07:23.234
To employees who may have suffered emotional distress as a result of our errors,

07:23.317 --> 07:25.027
We offer our sincerest apologies.

07:25.528 --> 07:26.446
Zero qualification excuse

07:26.529 --> 07:28.656
I logged on this morning to apologize.

07:28.739 --> 07:30.199
Zero qualifications.

07:31.325 --> 07:33.786
I read their apology
and it was shocking.

07:34.537 --> 07:38.624
I
am disturbed by the company's spineless attitude.

07:39.917 --> 07:42.545
Anyway, sorry,
Miss Zero Qualifications.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.924
Next stop, Euljiro 1-ga.

07:47.008 --> 07:49.010
Diligence, harmony, integrity

07:49.093 --> 07:50.219
listen.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.722
Regarding this question about employees…

07:53.514 --> 07:56.309
The employees were talking about it

07:56.392 --> 07:58.269
Because you give them trust.

07:58.352 --> 08:03.316
You even publicly apologized today
.

08:03.399 --> 08:05.776
Was he trying to make things worse?

08:07.236 --> 08:08.988
You are the CCO, right?

08:09.572 --> 08:12.116
It stands for Chief Creative…

08:16.704 --> 08:17.705
Anyway,

08:17.788 --> 08:21.792
That's not
why we gave her the position.

08:21.876 --> 08:24.504
I called her because I couldn't take it anymore.

08:25.046 --> 08:27.590
And it's not just me.
Imagine how Mr. Jung.

08:28.299 --> 08:30.801
then? Can you explain it to us?

08:32.136 --> 08:36.307
What makes the situation worse is when companies run low or low on inventory

08:37.308 --> 08:38.392
Condition.

08:39.060 --> 08:44.106
Just because management ignores it,
doesn't mean the problem goes away.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.691
This is a PR mistake.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.818
Why does management raise this issue?

08:48.444 --> 08:50.446
PR departments are afraid of management.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.199
How dare he say such a thing?

08:53.699 --> 08:55.034
From his standpoint?

08:55.618 --> 08:58.287
They don't want to upset Mr. Jung,

08:58.371 --> 08:59.872
Adding fuel to the fire.

09:00.581 --> 09:01.624
Sigla Gu!

09:06.629 --> 09:09.382
The PR office represents the company.

09:09.757 --> 09:13.094
Their job is to communicate with employees on behalf of the company.

09:13.177 --> 09:18.391
When did they care so much about
their employees' jobs?

09:18.975 --> 09:21.477
If we admit we made a mistake

09:21.936 --> 09:24.146
Will employees misjudge us?

09:24.438 --> 09:27.483
affim. That's exactly what I said.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.860
Better to do nothing.

09:30.528 --> 09:32.863
He is in Korea now, okay?

09:32.947 --> 09:35.324
We do things differently here.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.451
Do I really have to tell him?

09:38.035 --> 09:39.328
explain. Jung.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.622
Are you still reading print media?

09:42.415 --> 09:45.918
Promote your company on traditional channels like this

09:46.460 --> 09:48.879
This is no longer
the purpose of public relations.

09:49.213 --> 09:51.465
Today, businesses should...

09:51.882 --> 09:52.800
Sigla Gu!

09:52.883 --> 09:54.677
How dare you teach him a lesson?

09:59.682 --> 10:03.060
I don't want to hear excuses.
I'd like to hear your thoughts.

10:04.186 --> 10:06.522
As CCO, what do you think you did wrong?

10:16.073 --> 10:17.158
I see.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.330
I got you.

10:22.413 --> 10:23.414
But unfortunately,

10:24.290 --> 10:25.708
I have to go.

10:31.964 --> 10:37.553
As a communications manager, I carefully evaluate where I went wrong.

10:38.220 --> 10:39.096
excuse me.

10:39.930 --> 10:41.182
Sigla Gu.

10:41.265 --> 10:42.099
Sigla Gu.

10:53.152 --> 10:57.198
Sir, ignore her. Jung.

10:59.533 --> 11:03.204
God, why did Ms. Lin
bring someone like her here?

11:04.163 --> 11:05.623
Let's wait and see.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.917
There must be a reason why he called her.

11:15.007 --> 11:16.550
Do your parents need help?

11:17.385 --> 11:18.302
Come?

11:18.886 --> 11:20.054
Take one of mine as an example.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.973
No, I want someone official…

11:23.057 --> 11:23.891
listen.

11:24.433 --> 11:27.186
Maeng, you go back
and deal with the partner agencies.

11:27.895 --> 11:31.440
Kim and Lee,
you are mutual customers of Ryu.

11:33.943 --> 11:34.777
then…

11:35.152 --> 11:38.739
Ryu, the first team is short-handed.
You can help them.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.241
OK?

11:40.324 --> 11:42.326
Well, in short,

11:42.410 --> 11:44.245
I would be happy to have it.

11:46.038 --> 11:48.624
They will have a free desk.
You are moving today.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.968
OK

12:13.816 --> 12:15.484
sorry sir. song.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.154
I think this is too sudden...

12:18.237 --> 12:19.363
correct. I hope.

12:19.447 --> 12:20.364
Voiceover: Organizational Assessment

12:20.448 --> 12:22.450
Did you know we are in the VO period?

12:23.075 --> 12:26.454
But we don’t have much to do with that.
It’s the managers who do it…

12:26.537 --> 12:27.538
Not that.

12:28.038 --> 12:29.874
Use your brain.

12:31.041 --> 12:32.293
What does a team leader do?

12:32.877 --> 12:34.587
-They evaluate performance.
-Yes.

12:35.379 --> 12:37.214
Who is running for promotion?

12:41.010 --> 12:43.637
I'm running for
deputy director.

12:44.513 --> 12:46.515
Hugil e Jaemin is a manager.

12:46.599 --> 12:47.850
Is there anyone else besides Seung Hee?

12:47.975 --> 12:51.479
Sir, I am running for
Assistant Manager.

12:51.562 --> 12:53.856
All four? OMG.

12:54.398 --> 12:55.274
and…

12:55.357 --> 12:57.109
Damn, this is not good.

12:57.902 --> 13:00.112
You know I can only give one of them an A, right?

13:02.364 --> 13:03.282
So shameful.

13:03.532 --> 13:05.201
I want to give it to those who are running

13:05.284 --> 13:06.243
But you are all here.

13:07.161 --> 13:09.413
You have to take care of yourself.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.207
you are right?

13:11.290 --> 13:13.125
there is nothing. should go.

13:13.834 --> 13:15.461
Team 1 needs help.

13:15.544 --> 13:17.129
A PR office is a family.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.422
We should support each other.

13:19.089 --> 13:20.132
correct.

13:23.552 --> 13:25.262
It became a simple matter.

13:35.397 --> 13:36.524
Assistant Ji Dachun

13:41.737 --> 13:43.239
Ointment, yes. Give it to Dachun

13:44.406 --> 13:45.783
It's a pleasure to work with you.

13:48.202 --> 13:49.370
What does it mean?

13:50.788 --> 13:52.248
what are you doing here?

13:53.207 --> 13:54.041
Come?

13:54.124 --> 13:55.376
Aren't you planning on moving?

13:55.918 --> 13:57.753
You're only here for a few days, right?

14:01.382 --> 14:02.258
I have no idea…

14:03.008 --> 14:06.011
We need
someone who really works for our team.

14:06.095 --> 14:07.429
They want me to go crazy.

14:09.598 --> 14:10.724
Do you smoke?

14:11.642 --> 14:13.310
-No.
-Are you really not smoking?

14:13.394 --> 14:15.896
Or don't you want to smoke with me?

14:17.773 --> 14:20.025
No, I really don't smoke.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.151
I quit.

14:23.237 --> 14:25.197
Public Relations Team 1
Planning/Social Contribution

14:33.372 --> 14:35.791
Pretty scary, right?

14:39.295 --> 14:43.549
Public Relations Team 1

14:43.632 --> 14:45.467
CELLTICS ACTIVITIES
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN

14:46.635 --> 14:47.553
Let's start.

14:48.971 --> 14:51.599
The first activity of the event:
pop-up store

14:51.682 --> 14:54.184
They will
open tomorrow near the university campus.

14:55.185 --> 14:58.355
The second event is
a shared office a week later.

14:58.439 --> 14:59.732
OK

15:00.065 --> 15:01.817
What about online advertising?

15:01.901 --> 15:04.737
We sent her a new storyboard with changes.

15:05.070 --> 15:07.281
We will start with your approval.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.074
Park assistant?

15:09.658 --> 15:10.492
Yes.

15:11.785 --> 15:12.786
You know that, right?

15:12.870 --> 15:15.497
Ms. Park Yoon-joo
will be in charge of Celltics.

15:19.668 --> 15:22.379
I want to talk about fonts

15:22.463 --> 15:24.340
and color.

15:24.423 --> 15:28.177
We've discussed this many times.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.305
Jihyo said that
this would be the last time.

15:34.308 --> 15:38.395
Oh sorry.
I think you've decided everything.

15:38.479 --> 15:41.023
No, please tell us what you think.

15:41.106 --> 15:41.941
OK

15:52.076 --> 15:56.080
Since there is a new person in the project, why don't we have dinner together?

15:56.747 --> 15:57.623
tonight?

15:57.706 --> 15:59.917
Yes, we can leave after the meeting.

16:00.376 --> 16:02.920
It's easier than setting another date.

16:03.003 --> 16:04.380
Yes, it's okay.

16:04.463 --> 16:05.881
Well, of course.

16:14.306 --> 16:15.140
Park Assistant.

16:16.183 --> 16:18.602
-Yes, Mrs. Ji.
-Why did you apologize to them?

16:18.852 --> 16:21.188
You have a responsibility.
Please check if necessary.

16:21.772 --> 16:24.274
There's nothing to apologize for,
so no need to apologize.

16:26.276 --> 16:28.237
If you have an attitude of submission,

16:28.320 --> 16:30.239
It will be harder to give orders in the future.

16:31.031 --> 16:32.074
OK

16:36.745 --> 16:38.414
You no longer work for an agency.

16:38.497 --> 16:42.710
Remember where you stand before you say or do something.

16:43.419 --> 16:45.045
Okay, I know.

16:45.713 --> 16:46.547
let's go.

16:56.223 --> 16:57.349
What are you doing?

16:58.058 --> 17:00.060
Why are you still working?

17:02.479 --> 17:04.606
It's still early.

17:04.982 --> 17:06.567
I'm hungry. let's go.

17:07.151 --> 17:09.319
Shouldn't we meet at the restaurant?

17:09.903 --> 17:11.405
Come on, let's go!

17:14.408 --> 17:15.784
I know Jung called you.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.202
what did he say?

17:18.579 --> 17:21.040
He blamed me for my bad work.

17:21.832 --> 17:22.708
What?

17:23.125 --> 17:25.419
Has the great Goo Yi Jung been scolded?

17:27.129 --> 17:31.675
Fortunately he didn't let me
put my hands in the air.

17:32.968 --> 17:35.596
But I bet he's shy.

17:36.263 --> 17:37.431
Kim is a jerk, right?

17:38.015 --> 17:40.142
A real asshole.

17:43.645 --> 17:44.772
Anyway,

17:45.397 --> 17:48.442
Is a public apology really necessary ?

17:52.696 --> 17:53.530
Yes.

17:54.114 --> 17:55.783
There are not only users.

17:55.866 --> 17:58.535
We must treat our employees as
customers

17:58.619 --> 18:00.412
And satisfy them too.

18:01.121 --> 18:02.498
Times have changed.

18:02.581 --> 18:04.833
Every employee
is a media channel

18:05.042 --> 18:07.920
Their posts
can become newspaper articles.

18:08.295 --> 18:12.382
Their negative comments about the company
resulted in bad publicity

18:12.466 --> 18:16.261
This could cause
the share price to fall

18:17.096 --> 18:18.013
Miss.

18:18.931 --> 18:19.932
I see.

18:20.808 --> 18:21.642
OK

18:22.684 --> 18:25.312
Oh my God, you scare me.

18:26.563 --> 18:28.857
What types of images work best?

18:30.025 --> 18:31.693
I've thought about this.

18:32.736 --> 18:35.572
How about an AD who is a good communicator?

18:36.365 --> 18:39.243
AD that communicates well with the MZ generation.

18:40.035 --> 18:40.953
That's a good idea,

18:41.537 --> 18:44.748
But to become one of them,
she must communicate with them.

18:44.832 --> 18:47.543
Can we be less formal outside of work?

18:47.626 --> 18:48.794
It's more difficult for me.

18:49.378 --> 18:50.879
Well, whatever you think.

18:53.841 --> 18:54.925
first,

18:55.008 --> 18:57.928
In order to communicate well with them,
you have to listen to them.

18:58.011 --> 19:00.139
What’s so hard about listening?

19:00.889 --> 19:03.809
We have a digital PR team, right?

19:03.892 --> 19:05.894
I will find someone to help me.

19:06.478 --> 19:07.980
The problem is solved. It's easy.

19:08.063 --> 19:09.356
Not if they don't talk.

19:10.774 --> 19:14.862
Do you trust your employees
to open up to you?

19:15.779 --> 19:17.030
This is where the problem lies.

19:17.114 --> 19:19.575
As far as I know,
Generation MZ is outspoken,

19:20.159 --> 19:21.577
This will make you angry.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.371
Hanyu Fashion CEO Kang said.

19:24.955 --> 19:27.499
They don't do this to just anyone.

19:27.583 --> 19:30.919
-So, should I do it or not?
-I say you have to do it right.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.213
That's why I brought you here.

19:33.755 --> 19:34.923
rely on you.

19:38.093 --> 19:39.261
my God.

19:39.970 --> 19:41.722
Things were different for the third team.

19:41.805 --> 19:42.973
You eat this.

19:48.103 --> 19:51.190
This is date food,
not a business dinner.

19:51.273 --> 19:54.359
Sorry, why are you here?

19:56.403 --> 19:58.322
Him, because before he took charge.

19:59.031 --> 20:02.951
And me, because I'm a new manager
and a new manager at a partner agency.

20:04.494 --> 20:06.330
AD Seo, you don’t mind?

20:06.413 --> 20:08.457
I really love her.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.125
Luo arrived?

20:11.251 --> 20:13.503
OK I see.

20:14.630 --> 20:16.548
As the gatekeeper, I propose a toast.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.634
- Raise your glasses.
-it's no use.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.844
-let's go.
-Seriously, cheers?

20:20.928 --> 20:23.096
Raise your glasses. strength.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.181
I will make a beautiful one.

20:25.432 --> 20:29.228
OK
I wish Celltics great success.

20:29.311 --> 20:30.562
salute!

20:30.646 --> 20:32.314
-We are a good team.
-healthy.

20:33.523 --> 20:34.399
cheers.

20:34.483 --> 20:35.442
-healthy.
-Thanks.

20:36.401 --> 20:38.445
I look forward to working with you.

20:38.737 --> 20:41.031
Me too.

20:49.331 --> 20:53.502
For the record, this isn't
the meal we're talking about.

20:53.585 --> 20:54.461
Come?

20:55.212 --> 20:57.214
remember? I'd like to treat you to something to eat.

20:59.758 --> 21:02.219
We're doing it now, aren't we?

21:02.302 --> 21:04.346
Yes, but with other people.

21:04.930 --> 21:08.850
I did not mean that.
I mean just the two of us.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.102
Just the two of us?

21:11.353 --> 21:13.563
So this is a date, right?

21:16.483 --> 21:18.360
excuse me. I'm kidding.

21:18.443 --> 21:19.278
OK

21:21.238 --> 21:22.698
Your whole body turned red.

21:23.407 --> 21:26.410
I get drunk very easily.

21:29.413 --> 21:31.373
It's a little hot in here, isn't it?

21:33.834 --> 21:35.294
Is it yummy?

21:36.169 --> 21:37.379
Do you like it?

21:37.462 --> 21:38.297
Yes.

21:39.172 --> 21:41.675
Next time we will organize
a formal dinner.

21:41.883 --> 21:42.801
I think.

21:48.348 --> 21:49.641
Hello sir. song.

21:53.645 --> 21:54.688
OK

21:54.938 --> 21:56.606
I'm waiting.

21:57.357 --> 21:58.275
Until we meet again.

22:02.821 --> 22:03.905
I don't need wine anymore.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.282
It's new.

22:05.365 --> 22:07.284
Drinks are paid for by the company.

22:08.118 --> 22:09.995
gentlemen. Song went out to drink.

22:10.078 --> 22:11.038
so?

22:11.121 --> 22:12.622
He needs a ride.

22:13.081 --> 22:14.041
I provided.

22:16.293 --> 22:21.298
This shows
how difficult it is to make a living.

22:25.677 --> 22:27.346
You'll see it soon.

22:28.638 --> 22:29.598
people.

22:30.474 --> 22:34.436
Did you know that Jaemin is helping Team 1 now?

22:34.686 --> 22:36.521
He will no longer write press releases.

22:37.439 --> 22:38.523
Wait, why?

22:38.815 --> 22:41.568
No one writes press releases better than him.

22:41.693 --> 22:43.987
Why are you doing this to me?

22:44.071 --> 22:45.947
Talk to Mr. Song.

22:46.031 --> 22:46.907
your thoughts.

22:46.990 --> 22:50.285
Because Jaemin
defended Park Yoon Jo in "Blahbla", right?

22:50.786 --> 22:53.789
seriously. This speaks volumes
about his character.

22:55.165 --> 22:56.249
Did you save me?

22:56.333 --> 22:57.834
Why don't you apologize to him?

22:58.543 --> 22:59.544
everything is fine.

23:00.128 --> 23:01.797
Work is less stressful.

23:02.297 --> 23:03.673
Honestly, it's better this way.

23:04.841 --> 23:07.552
What did you do to protect her
?

23:11.890 --> 23:12.933
It is nothing special.

23:13.642 --> 23:15.811
And it has nothing to do with her.

23:27.280 --> 23:29.449
Are you sure you're okay?

23:30.033 --> 23:30.951
correct.

23:31.535 --> 23:32.619
Why?

23:38.250 --> 23:41.169
Come on, Team 1 isn't that bad.

23:42.504 --> 23:44.881
What are you doing there?

23:49.052 --> 23:50.178
Organizing a dinner party?

23:52.347 --> 23:53.223
Yes.

23:53.306 --> 23:54.516
Team leaders and managers

23:54.599 --> 23:57.144
The Strategic Management Department
will have dinner together this Friday.

23:58.520 --> 23:59.855
-Should I organize it?
-Yes.

24:00.313 --> 24:04.025
Gi assistant is busy
dealing with university testers. correct?

24:04.109 --> 24:06.153
Yes, gosh…

24:07.362 --> 24:09.573
I need you to do it.

24:14.995 --> 24:17.664
Yes, there will be 15 to 20 people.

24:18.790 --> 24:19.666
Yes.

24:20.500 --> 24:21.460
drinks.

24:22.335 --> 24:24.379
Drinks...please wait.

24:24.921 --> 24:25.922
Assistant Ji.

24:26.006 --> 24:28.091
What do executives drink?

24:29.259 --> 24:31.761
If it's a Korean restaurant,
soju with ice and tonic.

24:31.845 --> 24:34.973
If it is a Western restaurant,
whiskey or expensive wine.

24:35.056 --> 24:36.016
I see.

24:36.892 --> 24:37.767
soon?

24:38.435 --> 24:42.230
To drink, soju is served with ice and tonic water.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.274
Yes, please. Until we meet again.

24:50.322 --> 24:51.156
excuse me.

24:52.157 --> 24:53.742
Should I go to dinner too?

24:54.284 --> 24:56.203
Who else would stand at the counter?

24:56.286 --> 24:57.746
Escort them to the table?

24:58.622 --> 25:00.582
Why are you acting ignorant?

25:01.583 --> 25:02.792
Do you eat with reporters?

25:05.670 --> 25:07.380
I wouldn't eat there...

25:07.464 --> 25:10.717
I'm currently busy having students
test the product,

25:11.092 --> 25:12.802
Make sure everything goes smoothly.

25:13.053 --> 25:16.306
You are a smart person.
I believe you will succeed.

25:56.805 --> 25:57.764
Thanks.

26:05.313 --> 26:08.858
Is there a coffee break in the sales department
?

26:08.942 --> 26:09.776
It's too late now.

26:09.859 --> 26:12.028
No, it's not too late.

26:13.405 --> 26:14.489
We are on time.

26:16.950 --> 26:18.159
This is not true.

26:18.243 --> 26:19.661
You are late.

26:19.744 --> 26:21.204
let's go.

26:22.372 --> 26:24.249
I invited them to tea.

26:24.874 --> 26:26.001
Reason for delay.

26:28.086 --> 26:30.797
So, have you ever thought about it?

26:30.880 --> 26:33.300
We recommend Jung Soo Hwan

26:33.383 --> 26:35.510
Take on the role of Strategy Director.

26:36.011 --> 26:39.180
He can't come today
because he is on a business trip abroad.

26:39.806 --> 26:41.141
“Noi” ambition?

26:42.559 --> 26:43.435
Come?

26:43.893 --> 26:46.354
Are we officially on the same side?

26:50.358 --> 26:51.234
AD Lin.

26:52.235 --> 26:53.570
Let's start the meeting.

27:12.297 --> 27:13.673
Now we have to go.

27:15.050 --> 27:15.967
AD Lin.

27:16.176 --> 27:18.261
Marketing Director Jung Soo-hwan.

27:19.888 --> 27:20.805
When I…

27:22.223 --> 27:24.351
I start here, from the bottom,

27:24.976 --> 27:27.187
Kim is my team manager

27:27.729 --> 27:29.731
Jeong Suhwan serves as assistant manager.

27:30.231 --> 27:32.942
Everyone knows my dad is the CEO.

27:33.026 --> 27:35.487
He created a new department for me.

27:36.029 --> 27:37.739
i still can't forget

27:39.199 --> 27:42.410
They looked at me with evil eyes.

27:43.453 --> 27:46.206
They looked down on me
and laughed at me.

27:46.289 --> 27:48.291
They only see me as the CEO’s daughter,

27:48.375 --> 27:49.668
Not my strong point.

27:51.169 --> 27:53.296
I hated the education they received in front of me.

27:55.632 --> 27:57.092
This is part of the past.

27:57.884 --> 27:58.885
It matters now.

27:58.968 --> 28:00.095
Do you think they have changed?

28:00.679 --> 28:02.222
I'm not talking about them.

28:02.972 --> 28:06.142
I'm talking about you. You are a different person.

28:06.226 --> 28:07.060
I was serious.

28:09.354 --> 28:10.480
Anyway,

28:11.564 --> 28:12.816
It can't be Zheng

28:12.899 --> 28:13.983
You know.

28:14.359 --> 28:18.029
If he becomes director of strategy,
they'll chop off my legs.

28:18.113 --> 28:19.155
i will really be

28:20.198 --> 28:21.658
Just a puppet.

28:22.075 --> 28:24.661
All I have left is you,
the helpless CCO.

28:24.744 --> 28:28.373
I should name you
Director of Strategy, CSO.

28:28.998 --> 28:30.375
Actually, no.

28:31.751 --> 28:34.129
They approve you as CCO, but what about CSO?

28:34.963 --> 28:36.881
They would tear me to pieces.

28:40.802 --> 28:44.305
So I want
to have dinner with the strategy department.

28:44.723 --> 28:47.767
They're on my side.
I should make my presence felt.

28:52.105 --> 28:54.107
Who will manage my social activities?

28:54.190 --> 28:56.609
Park Yoonjo, assistant manager of the PR 3 team.

28:57.193 --> 28:59.195
-Blabula's girlfriend?
-You know who he is.

28:59.279 --> 29:02.115
AD who is good at communication. view?

29:04.075 --> 29:05.076
correct.

29:06.327 --> 29:08.913
Talk to the designer and let me know.

29:10.123 --> 29:11.040
of course.

29:12.167 --> 29:15.170
Is this store open at noon?

29:16.588 --> 29:18.089
Of course I'll be there.

29:18.506 --> 29:21.301
AD SEO will come to get you.

29:21.384 --> 29:23.219
it's no use. We see them.

29:23.636 --> 29:26.222
he insisted. See you later.

29:37.650 --> 29:39.486
I'll pick you up in 30 minutes

29:39.569 --> 29:41.571
Go to the store on the left side of the intersection.

29:47.994 --> 29:50.288
Jihyo, do you want to come?

29:50.580 --> 29:52.999
Celltics’ offline event begins today.

29:53.082 --> 29:55.668
Didn't you hear
what Team Leader Ji said to me?

29:57.086 --> 29:59.964
I finally have my own client

30:00.465 --> 30:01.466
I am very busy.

30:01.549 --> 30:02.967
What product is it?

30:03.051 --> 30:03.885
Protein powder.

30:04.761 --> 30:05.678
protein?

30:06.095 --> 30:07.347
I know something.

30:07.972 --> 30:10.850
Yes, I'm sure that's the case.

30:31.162 --> 30:32.080
dairy cow.

30:36.501 --> 30:38.419
-greeting.
-Yes, bye.

30:38.503 --> 30:40.463
-I'll accompany you.
-Thanks.

30:47.971 --> 30:50.348
Yunzhu, I brought you coffee. and behind.

30:53.309 --> 30:54.352
Are they all for me?

30:54.435 --> 30:56.312
I didn't know you liked it.

30:57.021 --> 30:58.648
But there are many.

31:01.734 --> 31:04.070
That's a bit much, AD Seo.

31:04.153 --> 31:05.196
Vero?

31:05.947 --> 31:08.491
I mean, I think it's
a little too much.

31:08.575 --> 31:11.536
I have no preference for coffee.

31:12.120 --> 31:15.456
Drink iced coffee when it’s hot,
drink latte when you’re hungry

31:15.540 --> 31:17.417
Sweet when I need sugar.

31:18.293 --> 31:19.961
Then, you can drink them all.

31:20.044 --> 31:21.713
OK, thanks.

31:46.613 --> 31:47.488
Yes!

31:48.656 --> 31:51.326
Hi everyone, before I start I will explain the rules.

31:53.036 --> 31:54.579
Hello, try here.

31:54.787 --> 31:55.705
here it is.

31:56.789 --> 31:57.624
Win a bottle.

32:00.335 --> 32:01.294
-welcome.
-greeting.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.309
Congratulations!

32:16.392 --> 32:17.393
Thanks.

32:30.490 --> 32:32.033
Shall we go to the next one?

32:32.116 --> 32:32.992
correct.

32:34.118 --> 32:35.787
Yin Qiao, please forgive me.

32:39.332 --> 32:40.333
soon?

32:41.459 --> 32:42.919
OK I see.

32:43.336 --> 32:44.253
Thanks.

32:46.005 --> 32:47.048
excuse me,

32:47.131 --> 32:51.427
But I have to
have a conference call with Tony from Traders.

32:51.511 --> 32:52.720
can I see?

32:52.804 --> 32:54.472
affim. You are the customer.

32:57.725 --> 32:59.477
Hi Tony. How is it going?

32:59.560 --> 33:02.063
-Hello. Excellent. you?
-Excellent.

33:02.146 --> 33:05.400
This is my colleague, Yoonjo.

33:06.025 --> 33:07.360
Hi, nice to meet you.

33:07.443 --> 33:08.611
goodbye.

33:10.029 --> 33:12.198
So, what about media planning?

33:12.699 --> 33:17.495
As our current media plan
focuses more on online platforms,

33:18.287 --> 33:22.125
We can consider
shifting our focus to mobile devices.

33:22.208 --> 33:25.128
Research shows
that the average Korean

33:25.211 --> 33:30.466
More than 50% of purchases are
made via mobile phones.

33:30.550 --> 33:32.218
Based on this unique panorama,

33:32.301 --> 33:34.137
I believe

33:34.220 --> 33:37.640
Shift focus
to mobile platforms

33:37.724 --> 33:43.146
By diversifying our inventory,
we can expect better results.

33:44.147 --> 33:46.691
We agree with you
about changing the media plan.

33:47.275 --> 33:51.195
We will investigate this further
as well as the inventory.

33:51.654 --> 33:54.323
Sorry, we have to go now.
But we’ll get to that later.

33:54.907 --> 33:56.617
affim. We'll talk soon.

33:56.701 --> 33:57.827
Thanks. Until we meet again.

33:58.494 --> 33:59.662
Thank you, good bye.

33:59.746 --> 34:00.997
-Hello.
- Until we meet again.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.417
my God.

34:04.500 --> 34:06.627
Bravo, AD Seo.

34:07.754 --> 34:10.798
-You can do absolutely anything, right?
-Thanks.

34:11.299 --> 34:13.885
With Celltics, your skin will never be dry again
!

34:13.968 --> 34:15.261
Do you want to spin the wheel?

34:15.344 --> 34:17.180
Spin the wheel and win prizes.

34:17.305 --> 34:18.765
one two three.

34:21.851 --> 34:23.603
-excellent!
-excellent!

34:28.858 --> 34:30.109
This is great.

34:32.737 --> 34:35.573
This is something you've always done, right?

34:37.158 --> 34:39.827
View events offline,

34:39.911 --> 34:42.038
Hold meetings with your foreign partners

34:42.121 --> 34:44.916
Then find customers yourself.

34:46.793 --> 34:48.628
I already told you, right?

34:49.170 --> 34:51.839
Like you, I put a lot of effort into my work.

34:52.757 --> 34:55.218
It's not easy for me
to be satisfied with myself.

34:55.635 --> 34:58.304
I also want to show others
my worth.

35:00.640 --> 35:02.934
But you told me not to do that.

35:03.768 --> 35:04.769
I know.

35:05.228 --> 35:06.312
But it's hard.

35:08.231 --> 35:11.859
Well, I admire that,
but for your employees

35:12.527 --> 35:14.612
You may not like it.

35:15.196 --> 35:18.491
If the boss tries too hard,
they will feel obligated to do so.

35:19.325 --> 35:20.409
it is true.

35:22.370 --> 35:25.373
I never pick up customers.
I'm only doing this for you.

35:25.998 --> 35:27.375
What? Why?

35:29.085 --> 35:30.962
Because I like that.

35:36.217 --> 35:38.469
It's been a while
since I attended an event like this.

36:11.335 --> 36:12.837
-No, again.
-OMG.

36:13.588 --> 36:15.548
- Like this.
——That must be the case.

36:15.631 --> 36:18.759
-No, it's not. You are all wrong.
- Like this.

36:18.843 --> 36:20.761
-No.
- Rotate your wrist twice.

36:20.845 --> 36:23.014
-Before doing this?
-Let's try again.

36:23.097 --> 36:24.223
If it doesn't work, we change.

36:24.307 --> 36:25.725
-OK.
-hurry up. Hey, get ready.

36:25.808 --> 36:26.684
It's going too fast.

36:47.622 --> 36:48.497
Forza.

36:48.581 --> 36:50.499
I'm fine! continue!

37:05.097 --> 37:07.016
-Hey, did you see that?
-Very good.

37:07.558 --> 37:09.143
class president!

37:13.606 --> 37:14.690
Hey, rep.

37:16.567 --> 37:17.443
What…

37:18.027 --> 37:19.737
-what is that?
-what is what?

37:20.112 --> 37:21.030
I want to say...

37:21.113 --> 37:22.907
You also have good grades.

37:22.990 --> 37:24.700
This isn't fair. Why do you dance so well?

37:24.784 --> 37:26.369
Because I learned.

37:27.161 --> 37:28.496
I take dance classes.

37:28.579 --> 37:30.539
-Why?
-as.

37:31.374 --> 37:32.250
Anti-stress.

37:34.460 --> 37:35.795
I hate you.

37:37.797 --> 37:38.839
Hey, rep.

37:40.466 --> 37:41.300
you can…

37:43.511 --> 37:45.721
Can you teach me the previous steps?

37:45.805 --> 37:46.847
But if you hate me.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.516
I hate you because you are strong.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.102
So, come on.

37:52.061 --> 37:52.895
Taught me.

37:55.982 --> 37:56.816
Yes?

37:56.899 --> 37:57.775
Utopia

37:57.858 --> 37:58.943
it's a pity.

37:59.819 --> 38:01.904
OK

38:02.655 --> 38:04.198
Hey, Yoon-kyo can't come.

38:04.782 --> 38:05.866
cabbage.

38:07.368 --> 38:10.579
Hey, your hands are shaking.

38:14.875 --> 38:17.253
That idiot. Qi Dachun, this bastard...

38:17.336 --> 38:19.880
What does he have, some kind of
inferiority complex?

38:21.424 --> 38:22.258
What?

38:23.384 --> 38:24.719
How do you understand this?

38:24.802 --> 38:26.345
Judging from the things you said.

38:26.429 --> 38:28.889
Always an assistant manager,
never promoted.

38:29.682 --> 38:32.727
He switched from sales to PR less than a year ago .

38:33.227 --> 38:34.812
You're not friends and you don't know.

38:34.895 --> 38:36.522
Who is grumpy and intolerant.

38:36.605 --> 38:38.524
And he hated those who came out of the draft.

38:38.607 --> 38:40.276
Oh my gosh, yeah.

38:41.986 --> 38:43.446
Your technology has improved.

38:43.529 --> 38:45.823
Come on, you can't call it a skill.

38:45.906 --> 38:48.409
I deal with a lot of people here.

38:49.035 --> 38:51.662
They were happy when I remembered details about them.

38:51.746 --> 38:53.831
This is a skill. business skills.

38:55.124 --> 38:57.960
how about you? You really don't?

38:59.003 --> 39:00.629
-That?
- Feeling of inferiority.

39:01.464 --> 39:04.633
Everyone feels inferior about something
.

39:06.135 --> 39:07.136
Jaemin.

39:08.888 --> 39:10.056
Nice to meet you.

39:10.556 --> 39:11.682
Hey, what are you doing here?

39:12.266 --> 39:14.185
This is a bar. I'm obviously here for a drink.

39:14.602 --> 39:16.395
-Well, I'm back.
-Hello.

39:16.812 --> 39:18.439
what are you saying?

39:19.482 --> 39:20.691
I take the usual approach.

39:20.775 --> 39:21.609
Understood.

39:23.235 --> 39:24.445
"usually?"

39:24.528 --> 39:25.863
Now I come here often.

39:26.781 --> 39:28.324
what are you saying?

39:29.909 --> 39:30.910
Inferiority complex?

39:32.203 --> 39:33.245
Inferiority complex?

39:35.081 --> 39:36.082
Do you know what it is?

39:38.542 --> 39:39.752
Why does everyone say this?

39:40.795 --> 39:45.091
I would be flattered if you thought I was so perfect .

39:46.467 --> 39:47.843
but I am not.

39:47.927 --> 39:50.888
Even now I still feel very pitiful

39:51.597 --> 39:52.598
and deficiencies.

39:52.681 --> 39:53.933
I feel the same way.

39:57.186 --> 39:59.605
And you? What makes you feel inferior?

39:59.688 --> 40:00.981
I don't think there is anything.

40:01.065 --> 40:02.858
I lack talent.

40:03.692 --> 40:05.611
That's a big inferiority complex, isn't it?

40:06.445 --> 40:07.363
Is it you, huh?

40:07.947 --> 40:09.907
I worry about the rent every month

40:09.990 --> 40:11.700
I thought to myself:

40:14.203 --> 40:15.871
"What am I doing?"

40:16.288 --> 40:18.833
“What am I selling here,
drinks or my soul?”

40:22.670 --> 40:24.088
Poor, right?

40:25.339 --> 40:27.758
How about an expensive cocktail?

40:27.842 --> 40:29.051
Your friend?

40:31.220 --> 40:32.555
-Yes, of course.
-Yes, of course.

40:33.556 --> 40:34.807
You always drink expensive stuff.

40:34.890 --> 40:37.351
Next month brings some
expensive rent.

40:37.435 --> 40:38.727
One million and eight.

40:38.811 --> 40:41.647
-Hey, I gotta go.
-Hey, where are you going?

40:41.730 --> 40:43.524
-let it be!
-Hey!

40:50.865 --> 40:52.533
Why are you working so hard?

40:53.492 --> 40:55.494
Submit budget increase report.

40:57.913 --> 40:59.039
This is Kat's job.

40:59.707 --> 41:00.833
I knew it.

41:01.333 --> 41:03.252
He gave it to you, didn't he?

41:03.335 --> 41:05.421
Yes, why?

41:06.630 --> 41:08.883
Well, you'll see soon enough.

41:13.095 --> 41:14.597
Obviously,

41:14.680 --> 41:16.682
Kim wants Jeong to serve as marketing director,

41:16.765 --> 41:17.641
is the new chief security officer.

41:17.725 --> 41:19.810
So the captains panicked.

41:21.479 --> 41:22.313
Why?

41:22.396 --> 41:24.273
Why? In your opinion?

41:24.356 --> 41:27.276
Zheng Xiuhuan is under the protection of her husband. gold.

41:27.359 --> 41:31.655
If he becomes chief strategy officer,
what do you think that means?

41:31.739 --> 41:34.992
Who wants to get rid of
all AD Lim’s followers ?

41:35.075 --> 41:36.619
in strategic management.

41:37.453 --> 41:39.163
Hey, think about it.

41:39.246 --> 41:42.333
Would you let the CCO go when no one knew what it was for?

41:42.416 --> 41:44.877
What went wrong with the CCO?

41:44.960 --> 41:46.295
What's the point if no one's here

41:46.378 --> 41:48.130
sa want me to write "communication"?

41:48.214 --> 41:50.216
And then it comes from abroad.

41:50.299 --> 41:51.550
She was like an intruder.

41:51.634 --> 41:53.677
You don't even know how to spell it.

41:53.761 --> 41:56.597
Why do such experienced people
come to work here?

41:57.681 --> 42:00.226
To me, he had no idea
what he was getting into.

42:02.228 --> 42:03.729
I don't know either.

42:03.812 --> 42:06.065
of course not.

42:06.148 --> 42:08.192
You are a simple assistant manager.

42:10.694 --> 42:11.695
correct.

42:12.196 --> 42:14.365
Where are they going to have dinner tonight?

42:14.448 --> 42:15.533
Algoladen.

42:16.408 --> 42:17.952
At that Korean restaurant?

42:18.035 --> 42:20.287
It has a great menu. correct.

42:20.788 --> 42:21.830
race,

42:22.748 --> 42:25.543
That place is a bit old.
They must sit on the floor.

42:26.377 --> 42:28.963
What will Ms. Gu and Ms. Lin wear?

42:30.130 --> 42:33.259
Will wearing a skirt look uncomfortable?

42:46.272 --> 42:48.274
where are you going? Where are you two going?

42:51.944 --> 42:53.028
curse.

42:54.071 --> 42:57.741
Look at the time.
They will go out to meet with reporters.

42:57.825 --> 43:00.160
Why only them?

43:01.787 --> 43:03.539
Kim Hugill, that bastard.

43:03.622 --> 43:07.543
-In my opinion, Seunghee will get an A.
-Why?

43:07.626 --> 43:11.380
She is the smartest of the three of you.

46:16.148 --> 46:18.025
Tonight you'll be sitting on the floor,

46:18.108 --> 46:20.319
You may find the skirt uncomfortable.

46:20.402 --> 46:21.904
Guijeong

46:34.249 --> 46:35.292
Thanks.

47:02.486 --> 47:03.570
This way.

47:11.370 --> 47:14.706
Fill all the cups.

47:15.499 --> 47:16.333
very good.

47:21.046 --> 47:22.005
Sigla Gu.

47:22.548 --> 47:23.423
Thanks.

47:23.507 --> 47:26.927
First I want to express
all my love

47:27.010 --> 47:28.428
Author: Lin Zhixian AD.

47:28.512 --> 47:31.181
Now let us hear his toast.

47:35.394 --> 47:39.189
I always make the same toast.

47:39.773 --> 47:40.983
which one?

47:41.066 --> 47:43.193
- Leeteuk!
- Leeteuk!

47:43.277 --> 47:44.945
-L!
-Work!

47:45.028 --> 47:46.864
-and!
-Excellent!

47:46.947 --> 47:48.949
-and!
-And enthusiasm!

47:49.032 --> 47:50.701
-T!
-They will turn you into a leader

47:50.784 --> 47:53.120
——Your generation!
-healthy!

48:10.012 --> 48:11.638
Let's start eating, shall we?

48:13.181 --> 48:14.057
Yes.

48:24.735 --> 48:25.903
AD Lin.

48:25.986 --> 48:30.073
Every time I hear his toast,
I feel like I'm getting an electric shock

48:30.157 --> 48:32.367
Run through my body.

48:35.621 --> 48:37.080
-Really?
-Yes.

48:37.164 --> 48:38.165
That toast…

48:39.291 --> 48:42.127
Did you learn it from Kim Yeon Soo?

48:47.883 --> 48:50.135
He taught her when she was a newbie.

49:04.191 --> 49:05.901
I think I'll leave now.

49:09.237 --> 49:10.238
Then maybe I should...

49:10.322 --> 49:11.198
No.

49:11.281 --> 49:12.824
Your subtraction.

49:12.908 --> 49:15.452
This dinner
is to welcome you. Stay.

49:16.453 --> 49:17.913
nobody

49:18.872 --> 49:20.874
He had to chase me to stop me.

49:37.557 --> 49:40.185
-Ms. Gu, can you?
-affim.

49:40.268 --> 49:41.311
Thanks.

49:41.979 --> 49:44.106
I am Song Suntae from the Public Relations Team 2.

49:44.189 --> 49:45.983
Yes, nice to meet you.

49:47.359 --> 49:49.111
She focuses on ASG,

49:49.194 --> 49:52.906
This is
of interest to every society today.

49:52.990 --> 49:53.824
correct.

49:54.825 --> 49:57.911
So I have some questions for you.

49:58.745 --> 50:01.164
She is a public information officer.
How did you change careers?

50:01.957 --> 50:04.918
Is it easier to do this in other countries?

50:05.002 --> 50:06.044
not completely…

50:06.128 --> 50:09.006
I am also very curious.

50:09.089 --> 50:14.511
Frankly, the whole concept of ASG
is impractical for Korean businesses.

50:15.137 --> 50:19.307
We do this because foreign companies

50:19.391 --> 50:21.977
They impose it on us.

50:23.353 --> 50:25.856
Consumers and markets
are changing,

50:25.939 --> 50:27.566
It also depends on the company.

50:27.649 --> 50:28.608
This is the base.

50:29.192 --> 50:30.068
question?

50:30.527 --> 50:31.945
Is the situation different in South Korea?

50:32.029 --> 50:34.781
Well, not exactly.

50:35.574 --> 50:38.243
She looks like a real pro.

50:38.326 --> 50:39.244
Well

50:39.995 --> 50:43.457
How did you
become an ASG expert?

50:44.041 --> 50:47.627
The core of ASG is communication.

50:48.920 --> 50:50.505
The same goes for PR, right?

50:50.589 --> 50:51.798
correct.

50:52.716 --> 50:55.761
I think this is a
more than adequate answer.

50:56.845 --> 50:58.180
Well, I might as well suggest

50:58.597 --> 51:01.349
The Office of Public Relations is responsible for
ASG's practices.

51:03.018 --> 51:04.728
Every company's situation is different.

51:06.188 --> 51:08.023
Some set up new departments,

51:08.106 --> 51:09.983
Others let them
do strategic planning.

51:10.067 --> 51:11.026
will

51:11.109 --> 51:15.155
It will definitely be more efficient to work with a PR expert.

51:16.406 --> 51:17.365
"PR expert."

51:18.075 --> 51:20.327
It all looks very beautiful to me

51:21.369 --> 51:23.413
She is definitely an expert.

51:23.497 --> 51:26.208
But why do PR departments
need experts?

51:30.170 --> 51:32.380
Is there a PR department that doesn’t have experts?

51:34.091 --> 51:35.842
Is La Seyong that kind of place?

51:36.468 --> 51:37.552
is that so?

51:39.221 --> 51:40.097
No.

51:40.806 --> 51:43.141
Seyong is more than just a place.

51:43.225 --> 51:44.851
No, of course not.

51:46.728 --> 51:49.064
excuse me. I need to go to the toilet.

51:54.653 --> 51:56.321
Sigla Gu. Prego.

51:57.989 --> 52:00.951
I want to learn a lot from her.

52:01.034 --> 52:03.078
I'm glad you came to Seyong.

52:03.537 --> 52:05.497
I am Ji Eunjeong, leader of the PR 3 team.

52:05.580 --> 52:07.165
I can't wait to work with her.

52:07.249 --> 52:10.544
I also look forward
to working with you.

52:10.627 --> 52:11.545
Sigla Gu!

52:11.628 --> 52:13.004
-hatred.
- Mrs. Gu!

52:13.088 --> 52:13.922
Yes?

52:14.005 --> 52:15.674
We're glad you're here!

52:15.757 --> 52:16.591
Thanks.

52:16.675 --> 52:18.760
Choi Young-ho, leader of the Public Relations Team 1.

52:18.844 --> 52:19.719
I see.

52:19.803 --> 52:20.971
Check,

52:21.471 --> 52:26.434
I'm so glad she's here!

52:26.518 --> 52:27.394
correct.

52:27.477 --> 52:30.647
Now we have a great person like her in our PR office!

52:30.730 --> 52:33.024
It sounds like you drank too much.

52:33.108 --> 52:34.317
Sigla Gu!

52:34.401 --> 52:39.573
Hope it can improve
the status of the public relations office!

52:40.115 --> 52:44.286
Not HR,
strategic planning, or legal.

52:44.369 --> 52:46.079
PR office!

52:46.830 --> 52:49.708
That's it! healthy!

52:49.791 --> 52:50.876
What are you doing?

52:50.959 --> 52:52.627
Damn, I'm sorry.

52:52.711 --> 52:54.713
-Hey, get up.
-Hey.

52:54.796 --> 52:55.922
Hey. What?

52:56.006 --> 52:56.840
Damn it, come on.

52:56.923 --> 52:58.341
Sun Tai, a cow.

53:03.638 --> 53:05.265
It's interesting. Yes.

53:07.767 --> 53:09.269
- Come on, cheers.
-OK.

53:09.352 --> 53:11.188
——One breath. We drink.
-We drink.

53:11.271 --> 53:13.940
I drank too much.

53:15.233 --> 53:16.443
Until the last drop.

53:16.526 --> 53:18.153
for you. healthy.

53:24.784 --> 53:25.619
Sigla Gu.

53:26.870 --> 53:28.788
Will he come to karaoke for round two?

53:28.872 --> 53:32.417
That's enough for today.

53:43.220 --> 53:45.513
What are you doing? Be there for her.

53:46.431 --> 53:47.390
Yes, sir.

53:58.944 --> 53:59.945
you eat?

54:01.071 --> 54:01.905
No.

54:02.614 --> 54:03.865
Well done today.

54:09.079 --> 54:10.330
How about dinner?

54:12.123 --> 54:12.999
used to be…

54:15.919 --> 54:16.836
Bad.

54:19.589 --> 54:21.174
I'm surprised you stayed.

54:22.217 --> 54:25.428
I thought if you didn't like it you would leave.

54:28.306 --> 54:29.641
You have relented

54:33.144 --> 54:34.104
All right…

54:34.187 --> 54:37.107
You're just here to take a break.

54:43.029 --> 54:43.863
Jaemin.

54:43.947 --> 54:44.864
So it is...

54:46.199 --> 54:47.158
la Seyong.

54:47.826 --> 54:49.536
I can't help but hope.

54:50.704 --> 54:52.539
You solved the Blahbla problem

54:54.624 --> 54:56.084
You are wonderful.

54:56.710 --> 54:58.128
I know Gu Yi Zheng.

55:00.839 --> 55:03.550
Now that I know what kind of person you are,

55:06.553 --> 55:07.804
I can't help but hope.

55:40.670 --> 55:44.215
Jung Soo-hwan

56:07.989 --> 56:09.240
Which of you is Park Yoon Joo?

56:11.201 --> 56:14.579
Park Yoonjo of the PR 3 team.
She wrote the report.

56:14.662 --> 56:15.997
Where?

57:07.757 --> 57:11.678
