(competition in life)

00:41.124 --> 00:43.918
(The characters, events, groups, organizations
and backgrounds of this drama are purely fictitious. We hereby inform you that)

00:47.630 --> 00:48.590
very good

00:49.215 --> 00:50.675
How many people are there in total?

00:50.759 --> 00:51.593
There is one more

00:51.676 --> 00:52.510
(Episode 8)

00:56.222 --> 00:58.099
I'm so happy to see you, we meet here again

00:58.558 --> 00:59.559
Yes, Director Goo

00:59.642 --> 01:00.685
sit down

01:11.529 --> 01:12.906
Nice to meet the people from the task force

01:14.324 --> 01:15.492
Then let's get started

01:19.537 --> 01:24.334
No matter what kind of organization it is,
it will have its own unique characteristics.

01:25.043 --> 01:27.921
What makes an organization work is its members

01:28.004 --> 01:29.172
Yes, that is, people

01:29.255 --> 01:32.759
In addition, it is also the members who can create the characteristics of the organization.

01:33.927 --> 01:34.886
In the organization…

01:39.015 --> 01:40.266
I have someone I like

01:41.518 --> 01:43.478
The guy I met in San Diego

01:44.145 --> 01:45.814
I saw her again

01:47.065 --> 01:48.566
I'm attracted to her again

01:49.526 --> 01:51.402
Started to care about her again

01:52.112 --> 01:54.781
Think about what kind of company you want to work for

01:55.281 --> 01:59.035
That is the organizational culture we will build in the future

02:00.161 --> 02:01.121
But this...

02:01.204 --> 02:04.124
What if it is for the sustainable development of the business
and the creation of profits?

02:04.207 --> 02:07.335
I want to be like her in the future

02:07.418 --> 02:09.587
She should have also produced company publications in the beginning.

02:11.589 --> 02:12.465
Hello

02:13.842 --> 02:16.636
You were suffering a lot during this period, right?

02:16.719 --> 02:18.513
No, it's okay with me

02:19.389 --> 02:22.517
What should you do if you really want to be appreciated by your boss?

02:22.600 --> 02:23.434
etc…

02:25.854 --> 02:27.689
Park Yoon-soo was present...

02:27.772 --> 02:30.150
The problem is that our levels are different

02:30.525 --> 02:32.193
Her rank is much higher than mine

02:32.277 --> 02:33.945
But isn’t that what everyone does?

02:34.154 --> 02:37.115
Want to show your best side
and be recognized by others

02:37.198 --> 02:41.327
In other words, if you are willing,
the company will change.

02:41.411 --> 02:44.873
And you should build the company in the direction you want.

02:45.498 --> 02:51.171
I hope everyone will first think about
what their dream company looks like.

02:51.629 --> 02:54.424
That will be part of the internal culture improvement program

02:55.133 --> 02:56.259
beginning

02:57.468 --> 03:01.389
First, the team leader responsible for the project must be selected

03:01.472 --> 03:04.058
Does anyone volunteer?

03:11.566 --> 03:12.734
I'm willing to give it a try

03:13.318 --> 03:15.278
If everyone agrees

03:15.904 --> 03:17.238
-What do you think?
-I agree

03:17.322 --> 03:18.740
Of course I agree

03:18.823 --> 03:20.366
Okay, I'll let you do it.

03:24.662 --> 03:25.830
Miss Park Yun Zhao?

03:26.539 --> 03:27.540
Um?

03:29.125 --> 03:31.669
Yes, I agree too

03:31.753 --> 03:34.505
Okay, then it’s decided

03:35.089 --> 03:37.425
- I'll leave everything to you
- Okay

03:37.508 --> 03:39.552
Let’s briefly discuss it here today.

03:40.136 --> 03:40.970
OK

03:42.513 --> 03:43.389
Thanks for your hard work

03:43.473 --> 03:44.933
Okay, I'll go first then

03:45.016 --> 03:45.892
Thanks for your hard work

03:51.022 --> 03:53.775
Then please let the team leader know the date of the next meeting of the task force.

03:53.858 --> 03:54.901
I will create another group chat room

03:54.984 --> 03:56.945
Okay, everyone has worked hard.

03:57.028 --> 03:59.405
-Thank you for your hard work
- Yes, thank you for your hard work

04:08.665 --> 04:09.499
(Flexible salary reward system)

04:09.582 --> 04:11.334
(This system allows employees to decide their workload at the beginning of the month
and the performance evaluation results will be reflected in their salary)

04:11.417 --> 04:12.585
(The team leader has the right to conduct individual comprehensive performance evaluation)

04:14.545 --> 04:17.966
As you can see, each group
is responsible for a different project

04:18.591 --> 04:22.553
The team leader and team members can decide
the workload of their own projects

04:23.304 --> 04:28.559
In addition, individual comprehensive performance evaluation
is also closely related to salary.

04:28.643 --> 04:31.896
So will your monthly work performance
be directly reflected in that month’s salary?

04:31.980 --> 04:32.814
right

04:32.897 --> 04:35.984
That means you get as much as you do, right?

04:36.067 --> 04:39.237
Yes, there will be group evaluations every month

04:39.904 --> 04:42.031
The larger the project size the team is responsible for

04:42.323 --> 04:44.075
The income will be more

04:44.450 --> 04:46.286
Salaries should also be increased accordingly

04:47.078 --> 04:49.831
In addition, this also contributes to the importance of personal time

04:49.914 --> 04:52.417
People who aspire to achieve a balance between work and life are better

04:54.043 --> 04:54.961
how do you feel?

04:55.044 --> 04:58.965
Are you willing to reconsider quitting your job now?

05:02.218 --> 05:03.678
Are you busy now?

05:03.886 --> 05:04.971
Why?

05:05.054 --> 05:06.723
Isn't there usually no one in the store at this time?

05:07.140 --> 05:08.641
Why are you so busy?

05:08.725 --> 05:10.893
Otherwise, come over and help me.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.645
But I want to talk to you

05:12.729 --> 05:13.604
hateful

05:13.688 --> 05:15.064
When am I during your working hours?

05:15.148 --> 05:16.649
Are you asking me to listen to my complaints?

05:16.941 --> 05:18.234
No, I mean...

05:18.318 --> 05:20.278
If you're just going to whine
then I'm hanging up, I'm busy

05:21.696 --> 05:23.865
Really, a heartless woman

05:25.491 --> 05:26.367
(Call records)

05:26.701 --> 05:28.536
Am I so friendless to begin with?

05:29.787 --> 05:31.539
Oh my god, Park Yoon So.

05:31.622 --> 05:34.292
Look how badly your people live.

05:35.835 --> 05:39.172
(Website manager: Lee Ha
Eun Jae Min, SEA Marketing Team: Kim Min Soo)

05:39.255 --> 05:40.089
(Representative Kim Hee-young)

05:41.174 --> 05:43.092
(Representative Kim Hee-young)

05:45.011 --> 05:46.220
Representative Kim, it’s me

05:46.721 --> 05:48.306
The stickiest chewing gum for you

05:48.765 --> 05:49.682
Where are you?

05:54.020 --> 05:55.313
Oh my god

05:59.692 --> 06:00.568
How do I look?

06:01.486 --> 06:02.695
-Thanks, Yun Zhao
. -It's very good.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.947
Yun Zhao, do you know how to do Taekwondo?

06:05.323 --> 06:07.450
Yes, because of my grandmother

06:07.533 --> 06:10.286
I have been told since I was a child that girls should be powerful

06:10.370 --> 06:12.955
So she first sent me to learn Taekwondo

06:13.039 --> 06:14.082
Your grandma?

06:14.916 --> 06:17.460
Yun Zhao, it seems that you
lived with your grandmother when you were a child.

06:17.543 --> 06:21.005
Because the man my mother was dating at the time didn't like children.

06:21.089 --> 06:23.174
She entrusted me to my grandmother

06:24.509 --> 06:25.385
Tied

06:26.260 --> 06:28.221
You can go get spanked now

06:28.763 --> 06:30.807
Stand at attention and salute the other person

06:33.267 --> 06:34.185
Prepare

06:35.436 --> 06:36.479
start

06:41.943 --> 06:43.361
Wait, wait a minute!

06:47.490 --> 06:49.075
No, wait a minute...

06:56.040 --> 06:57.125
-Cheers
-Cheers

07:03.756 --> 07:05.842
So what rank are you in?

07:05.925 --> 07:07.260
Of course it's a black belt

07:07.718 --> 07:08.970
Oh my god

07:09.804 --> 07:13.850
It turns out there is a martial artist here.
Our Yun Zhao is really handsome.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.268
But I've forgotten all about it now

07:15.643 --> 07:18.563
But when I was in elementary school, I was really good at kicking.

07:18.646 --> 07:20.064
Like the little girl just now?

07:23.526 --> 07:28.239
So you have been living with grandma since then ?

07:28.322 --> 07:30.575
I moved to Seoul when I was in fifth grade.

07:31.451 --> 07:35.371
My mom was dating another man at the time

07:35.621 --> 07:36.789
And that man

07:38.082 --> 07:39.250
willing to accept me

07:44.964 --> 07:48.050
I miss my grandma so much. I haven’t seen her for a long time.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.635
Yes, go visit her quickly

07:49.719 --> 07:52.597
She may not be able to wait for you there forever

07:57.477 --> 08:00.062
But didn’t you come to me just because you had something to say?

08:05.234 --> 08:08.029
-Here are the two soju cocktails you ordered
. -Thank you.

08:08.112 --> 08:10.364
-What did you order?
-We also have two soju cocktails

08:10.448 --> 08:11.824
-That's right...
-That's right

08:15.912 --> 08:17.079
I am coming!

08:18.122 --> 08:19.332
Why did you come now?

08:23.544 --> 08:25.046
-Hello!
-Give me another cocktail, please

08:25.129 --> 08:27.006
Okay, send it over right away

08:27.089 --> 08:29.133
-Hey, Xiao En!
-Um

08:29.634 --> 08:30.718
Hey, what's going on?

08:30.801 --> 08:32.595
how so? This is how the same thing?

08:32.678 --> 08:35.139
I don't know, it seems to be an actor or a singer

08:35.223 --> 08:36.724
Introduce my bar on social media

08:36.807 --> 08:38.476
Said this is a good place to bring your own food and drinks

08:41.646 --> 08:44.190
Hey, don't just stand there stupidly,
come be a waiter.

08:44.857 --> 08:45.691
-me?
-Hello

08:45.775 --> 08:47.401
I don't have time to help customers order food right now

08:48.110 --> 08:50.488
- Come on
- Hey, which table is this?

08:50.571 --> 08:52.114
- That table over there
- Got it!

08:52.198 --> 08:53.699
-good!
-Xiao En

08:54.325 --> 08:57.245
-You're here.
-What's going on here? how so?

08:57.328 --> 09:00.623
Business is booming here, but you keep questioning it

09:00.706 --> 09:01.791
It makes people feel uncomfortable.

09:03.292 --> 09:06.587
A celebrity uploaded a post about Utopia on his social media

09:06.671 --> 09:08.172
OK, understood

09:09.215 --> 09:10.174
Do you need help?

09:10.258 --> 09:12.009
Of course, it's very necessary, please

09:12.385 --> 09:13.594
Please order for me, please

09:14.387 --> 09:15.304
order

09:16.556 --> 09:18.182
Is there anyone who hasn’t ordered yet?

09:18.266 --> 09:19.267
-Raise your hand, please
-me!

09:20.977 --> 09:22.144
Please raise your hand!

09:26.649 --> 09:27.858
come on

09:30.278 --> 09:31.279
Which table is this from?

09:32.321 --> 09:33.155
good

09:34.490 --> 09:36.450
- here's your beer
- thank you

09:39.579 --> 09:40.955
Hey, the drinks haven't been served to those two yet.

09:43.332 --> 09:45.418
I’m bringing you a cocktail, would you like to put it here?

09:45.710 --> 09:46.794
Please enjoy

09:47.169 --> 09:50.131
-Can I take a photo with you?
-me? Why do you want to take pictures with me?

09:50.256 --> 09:51.299
Because you are handsome

09:52.216 --> 09:53.426
Hey, snap shot

09:57.263 --> 10:01.559
I moved to Seoul when I was in fifth grade
and met him at school for the first time.

10:02.768 --> 10:05.980
At that time, I thought to myself,
"How can any boy be so good-looking?"

10:06.772 --> 10:08.649
His skin is really white

10:09.567 --> 10:13.446
And I was running around in the countryside all day long

10:14.030 --> 10:16.741
-You are so tanned.
-You are so handsome.

10:16.824 --> 10:17.950
you are really handsome

10:18.743 --> 10:19.619
but…

10:19.994 --> 10:20.911
one two three

10:20.995 --> 10:22.413
The most charming thing is

10:23.581 --> 10:25.124
his beautiful eyes

10:27.251 --> 10:32.715
(2001, 12-year-old Yunzhao and Xiaoen)

10:32.798 --> 10:34.175
Is today's lunch delicious?

10:34.258 --> 10:35.092
yes

10:35.468 --> 10:37.011
Which side dish do you think is the most delicious?

10:37.470 --> 10:38.429
sausage

10:38.512 --> 10:40.348
-Hey, look at me!
-Oh, I think that's delicious too.

10:41.515 --> 10:43.684
Damn it, how many times do you want me to say it?

10:43.768 --> 10:45.144
-Hey, I asked you to look at me
-Hey, raise your head

10:45.227 --> 10:47.229
-Hello!
-Hello!

10:47.313 --> 10:48.439
- Come on
- Where do you want to go?

10:48.522 --> 10:49.690
What not to do? Where do you want to run?

10:49.774 --> 10:51.442
-You don't want to go anywhere.
-I heard your dad went to jail.

10:51.525 --> 10:52.735
Isn't he from our class?

10:52.818 --> 10:53.986
Yes, Yoo Jae-min

10:55.988 --> 10:58.157
That very fair-skinned
Yoo Jae-min who always comes first in exams?

10:58.240 --> 11:00.117
You can't judge a person by his skin color

11:00.743 --> 11:02.828
-Hey, are you going to visit the prison?
-Are you going to jail too?

11:03.162 --> 11:04.580
Why are they bothering him?

11:04.664 --> 11:05.831
Hey, where do you want to run?

11:05.915 --> 11:07.458
- We're having fun.
- Lift your head up.

11:07.792 --> 11:10.670
- Lift your head up
- Jae Min's father is in jail

11:10.753 --> 11:11.921
Where are you going?

11:12.004 --> 11:12.880
Damn it!

11:12.963 --> 11:14.799
-They're all kids from around here.
-Where do you want to go?

11:14.882 --> 11:16.384
- Stay calm
- don't move!

11:16.467 --> 11:18.844
They probably thought
it was embarrassing to live in the same neighborhood as him.

11:18.928 --> 11:21.722
It was his father who was going to jail, why should he be tortured?

11:23.641 --> 11:25.726
Hello! Let him go!

11:26.394 --> 11:27.478
Why don't you let go quickly?

11:28.771 --> 11:30.147
-I said let him go!
-etc…

11:30.231 --> 11:31.440
Hello

11:31.565 --> 11:33.609
Wait, hey!

11:42.493 --> 11:45.621
They are all students from the nearby dojo.

11:50.459 --> 11:51.502
You stink...

11:54.296 --> 11:55.589
Hello!

12:19.488 --> 12:20.448
do not Cry

12:21.031 --> 12:23.743
It's not your fault that your dad is in jail.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.831
There were tears in his eyes

12:29.373 --> 12:31.500
The eyes that look at me are shining

12:31.917 --> 12:34.128
I felt a numbness in my chest

12:34.211 --> 12:35.629
It’s the innocence of a 12-year-old

12:35.713 --> 12:37.465
I fell in love with him just like that

12:38.090 --> 12:41.260
But you confessed to him but he was rejected?

12:43.721 --> 12:45.848
You should have confessed earlier

12:45.931 --> 12:48.601
Take advantage of the wonderful years in your teens or 20s

12:49.518 --> 12:52.313
There's a long and complicated reason

12:52.396 --> 12:53.773
But in one word

12:54.440 --> 12:55.608
It's just not the right time

12:55.691 --> 12:56.650
"opportunity"

12:58.194 --> 12:59.111
Of course timing is important

12:59.195 --> 13:00.279
anyway

13:01.447 --> 13:04.992
This is actually not what I want to tell you today.

13:05.075 --> 13:06.118
Well, what else?

13:06.202 --> 13:10.247
Just say it, tell it all
so that you won't get sick from boredom

13:11.040 --> 13:14.919
Jae Min rejected me because he had
someone , right?

13:15.002 --> 13:15.836
right

13:15.920 --> 13:19.882
But the person he likes is actually
the chief public relations officer of our company

13:21.842 --> 13:24.512
Chief public relations officer, she has a very high position

13:24.595 --> 13:28.015
Not only that, I entered
this industry as a role model.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.059
Do you know Goo Yi Jung?

13:34.271 --> 13:35.981
- Representative Kim, are you okay?
- Um, sorry.

13:40.402 --> 13:41.403
Oh my god

13:42.112 --> 13:43.531
This world is so small

13:44.990 --> 13:47.868
That one, Goo Yi Jung

13:48.452 --> 13:50.663
He was a colleague who joined the newspaper office at the same time as me.

13:51.956 --> 13:52.832
What?

13:52.915 --> 13:53.791
Um

13:56.669 --> 13:57.920
Thank you for your hard work

13:58.546 --> 14:00.673
I'm going to have a cigarette and then come back

14:05.928 --> 14:07.638
Do you like it here so much?

14:09.557 --> 14:10.516
really weird

14:10.891 --> 14:13.143
When you drink, don’t you always pay attention to the food that goes with your drinks?

14:13.227 --> 14:14.562
There's not even any food or drinks here.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.189
But there is something incomparable

14:17.565 --> 14:18.482
Hello

14:19.775 --> 14:21.777
You are her friend, so you should know

14:22.903 --> 14:26.073
If I told Xiao En that I liked her,
what do you think she would say?

14:27.449 --> 14:29.076
"Shut up and go away", is this the case?

14:31.370 --> 14:32.913
But the person you dated before...

14:32.997 --> 14:34.248
Yes, it's a man

14:34.915 --> 14:36.041
That's not important

14:36.625 --> 14:38.252
So what exactly are you trying to say?

14:38.502 --> 14:40.045
Do you want me to help you test her?

14:40.129 --> 14:42.965
No, why are you asking for me?
Of course I have to ask myself

14:43.048 --> 14:44.049
if not?

14:44.133 --> 14:47.428
I want you to tell me
what type of person Xiao En likes.

14:48.929 --> 14:51.390
The type like you...

14:53.559 --> 14:55.352
She should like it

14:57.062 --> 14:58.564
-Yeah?
-right

15:00.316 --> 15:01.358
Is she not heterosexual?

15:01.442 --> 15:04.320
Hey, that's the question you should ask yourself

15:05.029 --> 15:06.697
It's not my place to answer

15:07.865 --> 15:09.158
Just pretend you don’t know first.

15:16.332 --> 15:19.335
Xiao En, aren't you hungry?
Would you like to order some takeout?

15:21.211 --> 15:23.881
I want to eat very spicy chicken feet now

15:23.964 --> 15:25.841
Chicken feet? no problem

15:26.759 --> 15:28.385
Hey, where's Yun Zhao?

15:28.469 --> 15:29.303
I was about to ask you

15:29.386 --> 15:30.888
Why isn't Yun Zhao here?

15:31.472 --> 15:32.514
I'm here to find her

15:32.598 --> 15:34.850
She seems to be in a bad mood today

15:36.060 --> 15:36.894
Why?

15:36.977 --> 15:39.104
Her rejection by you should come to an end.

15:39.730 --> 15:41.398
I guess something happened to her today

15:42.441 --> 15:43.943
got rejected? Who?

15:45.569 --> 15:46.737
I go first

15:46.820 --> 15:48.322
Who was rejected?

15:49.114 --> 15:50.407
Have you rejected someone else again?

15:50.991 --> 15:52.451
It seems this guy is still very popular

15:52.534 --> 15:54.536
No, I was rejected too

15:54.912 --> 15:57.581
God, this is interesting.

15:57.665 --> 16:01.418
That's enough. You two
should enjoy the spicy chicken feet.

16:02.002 --> 16:02.878
I'm leaving

16:05.631 --> 16:07.758
Who? Who rejected him?

16:07.841 --> 16:08.842
I don't know either

16:09.885 --> 16:11.512
-Really
-when will the delivery arrive?

16:11.595 --> 16:12.763
About 30 minutes?

16:47.881 --> 16:50.050
when we met again by chance in new york

16:51.343 --> 16:52.720
We also drank wine together

16:56.348 --> 16:57.975
I thought I had completely forgotten you

16:58.559 --> 16:59.560
wrong

17:00.894 --> 17:02.062
It's me trying my best to forget you

17:02.855 --> 17:04.773
Because just thinking about you makes me uncomfortable

17:06.358 --> 17:07.443
But recently

17:09.403 --> 17:10.946
It keeps popping up in my mind

17:13.115 --> 17:14.616
those beautiful moments

17:21.415 --> 17:22.291
Cai Min

17:23.083 --> 17:24.418
I know to say that

17:27.254 --> 17:28.464
sorry for you

17:29.923 --> 17:31.050
but I

17:31.717 --> 17:32.843
impossible

17:34.511 --> 17:36.513
I won’t be your lover again

17:39.016 --> 17:41.018
If that's what you're looking forward to

17:41.602 --> 17:44.897
I think I need to make it clear to you clearly

17:49.193 --> 17:51.320
You also had this look at that time

17:51.820 --> 17:53.572
When you break up with me

17:55.616 --> 17:57.034
I get it now

17:58.118 --> 18:01.914
As long as your eyes remain firm,
no matter how hard I pester you

18:02.915 --> 18:04.208
You won't change your mind

18:05.125 --> 18:06.960
I was too young then

18:08.128 --> 18:10.380
The future is filled with confusion and uneasiness

18:11.882 --> 18:14.051
But now many things are different

18:14.426 --> 18:15.302
therefore

18:16.261 --> 18:18.722
That’s why I have expectations

18:38.700 --> 18:42.704
If you ever need someone to have a meal
or a drink with, you can give me a call.

18:42.830 --> 18:43.872
I want to be your friend

18:44.123 --> 18:47.960
I'm glad your reaction was more calm than I thought.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.381
If only I hadn't been so pretentious

18:53.882 --> 18:55.092
It would look pathetic

18:58.762 --> 18:59.847
good

19:00.389 --> 19:01.473
See you at our company

19:06.937 --> 19:08.647
To be honest, the so-called human heart

19:09.106 --> 19:10.816
really complicated

19:12.442 --> 19:14.987
When I heard about her from Caimin

19:15.237 --> 19:17.573
I feel resentful and jealous

19:19.867 --> 19:21.869
So what do you want to do?

19:23.078 --> 19:26.748
I understand that you feel very complicated now
and you can't help but care about them.

19:27.040 --> 19:27.916
but…

19:29.168 --> 19:31.003
Those are your emotions

19:31.128 --> 19:35.382
In fact, it has nothing to do with the two of them
, right?

19:36.383 --> 19:38.594
Yes, that's right

19:39.303 --> 19:40.554
you're right

19:40.637 --> 19:45.601
I still want to be appreciated by Director Goo
and be recognized by her

19:47.436 --> 19:50.480
It seems that I just need to sort out
my feelings for Xiaomin as soon as possible.

19:51.440 --> 19:55.402
But don’t push yourself too hard, you know?

19:56.069 --> 19:59.615
Sometimes letting yourself go and following your feelings
is a good way

20:00.199 --> 20:02.242
I want to let go of this relationship quickly now

20:04.578 --> 20:05.495
Hello everyone

20:05.579 --> 20:06.413
Hello

20:06.496 --> 20:07.414
You can sit outside

20:07.497 --> 20:09.499
-Okay, I got it, over there
-Thank you

20:09.583 --> 20:10.667
Okay, thank you

20:11.710 --> 20:12.711
Representative Xu

20:12.794 --> 20:14.046
-Do you want to sit outside?
-OK

20:14.171 --> 20:15.047
Masaaki

20:15.130 --> 20:16.965
It’s you, Donghun!

20:17.049 --> 20:18.800
Is everyone here together?

20:19.092 --> 20:20.886
-Senior
-Oh, wait...

20:21.678 --> 20:23.513
Let's sit over there

20:23.597 --> 20:25.349
-Is everyone here? Got it
- talk to you later

20:26.433 --> 20:29.311
I'm going to say hello and
I'll be back soon. Wait for me.

20:35.317 --> 20:37.152
-Hello
- are you all here? Did you just finish working overtime?

20:37.236 --> 20:38.195
-Yep
_

20:38.278 --> 20:40.530
Oh, thank you for your hard work.

20:40.614 --> 20:43.033
-You should treat them to something delicious.
-That's what I mean.

20:43.116 --> 20:45.118
Well, actually today I

20:45.202 --> 20:46.662
Went to learn Taekwondo

20:46.745 --> 20:48.247
-Taekwondo?
-Taekwondo?

20:48.330 --> 20:50.207
I'm still sparring with someone today

20:50.290 --> 20:53.001
The opponent is a petite elementary school girl

20:53.085 --> 20:54.253
But I keep running away

20:54.336 --> 20:55.379
- And I got a lot of beatings
- Oh my god

20:55.462 --> 20:57.839
-It's so miserable
-because I was too busy running away...

21:07.933 --> 21:11.395
Senior was stuck with them,
so I came here in her place, is that okay?

21:11.478 --> 21:13.188
I will never learn Taekwondo again

21:14.147 --> 21:15.023
I don't want to learn anymore

21:15.107 --> 21:16.900
-thanks
, thanks

21:16.984 --> 21:18.735
You don't have to care about me

21:18.819 --> 21:20.445
I've drunk enough, it's time to go

21:20.946 --> 21:22.155
This is not okay

21:22.239 --> 21:24.241
It took a lot of effort for us to meet each other.
You can't leave so quickly.

21:24.324 --> 21:25.450
Let’s have a toast first

21:25.534 --> 21:26.702
This is unfair

21:27.369 --> 21:29.913
I've been drinking it since just now.

21:29.997 --> 21:32.541
Okay, then I have to catch up with you

21:32.624 --> 21:34.960
No, that's not what I meant...

21:35.961 --> 21:37.504
You don't have to do that

21:43.885 --> 21:45.721
-Wait a minute-
Representative Kim, thank you so much today.

21:45.804 --> 21:47.264
I should be the one sending you back

21:47.389 --> 21:49.141
-I didn't expect that today would be...
-Ouch

21:49.349 --> 21:50.350
Hello

21:50.934 --> 21:52.269
Are you going to abandon me?

21:52.352 --> 21:54.187
-Where is a good place to go?
-No la…

21:54.271 --> 21:55.689
-Absolutely not like that-
Representative Kim, we...

21:55.772 --> 21:56.732
That's what you do

21:56.815 --> 21:57.858
-Right?
-That's it for today

21:57.941 --> 22:01.320
-You have to go home directly
. Seeing that you are in such a hurry to see me off, I guessed it right.

22:01.403 --> 22:02.237
I'll contact you again

22:02.321 --> 22:04.364
-Please send her back safely.
- Representative Kim, walk carefully and slowly.

22:04.448 --> 22:06.283
-Be careful when you go home.
-I can treat you

22:06.366 --> 22:07.451
- Be careful when you go home
- Goodbye

22:11.413 --> 22:14.082
-Okay, thank you for your hard work
. -Yes, thank you.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.834
-Then let's go
. -Goodbye

22:16.335 --> 22:17.461
Okay, go and renew the stall

22:17.669 --> 22:18.545
-Renew the share?
-Do you want to renew your stall?

22:18.628 --> 22:19.921
- ok
- let's go

22:21.298 --> 22:22.549
Won't you go with them?

22:23.216 --> 22:26.261
At times like this, I should know better and avoid them.

22:26.636 --> 22:29.014
I get it, "the boss is lonely"

22:32.392 --> 22:35.270
Would you like to find another place to have a drink?

22:39.858 --> 22:40.859
Alas

22:42.027 --> 22:43.904
I think it's time for you to go back

22:44.780 --> 22:46.907
No, I'm really fine

22:47.282 --> 22:50.285
I drank a lot just to keep up with your progress.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.204
So, you drank too fast

22:54.039 --> 22:55.916
Oh my God, where is your home?

22:55.999 --> 22:59.044
No, it's okay, I have to take you home

22:59.127 --> 23:01.046
Representative Xu, tell me your address quickly.

23:02.255 --> 23:03.090
I'm fine

23:03.173 --> 23:04.091
No, you're in trouble

23:06.385 --> 23:07.677
Oh my god

23:12.224 --> 23:13.517
Uncle driver, please take him to Jamsil

23:13.600 --> 23:15.143
You can't leave him alone

23:17.104 --> 23:19.398
OK, I'll go with him

24:17.247 --> 24:18.290
Have you arrived at the company?

24:19.416 --> 24:21.293
Come meet me in the stairwell

24:55.118 --> 24:56.620
Hey, here I come

24:57.954 --> 24:58.955
What's up?

24:59.289 --> 25:00.916
What's wrong? What's the matter?

25:01.541 --> 25:03.043
I'm going to be exhausted

25:06.379 --> 25:08.840
Why don't you take the elevator instead of running up?

25:09.508 --> 25:10.425
What?

25:15.222 --> 25:16.139
That is to say

25:16.806 --> 25:19.893
Isn't there a task force meeting later?

25:20.644 --> 25:22.812
We will continue to meet at the company in the future

25:22.896 --> 25:24.606
So I think we need to make it clear

25:26.107 --> 25:29.486
I plan to keep my distance from you for a while.

25:30.570 --> 25:32.322
Even if we are friends, it is necessary

25:34.574 --> 25:38.912
It's just to make me feel more comfortable,
I know it's selfish

25:39.746 --> 25:40.956
Sorry for you too...

25:41.039 --> 25:42.082
No way

25:43.208 --> 25:44.459
do what you want to do

25:45.293 --> 25:46.670
You can do whatever you want

25:48.630 --> 25:50.507
I know how to pretend like nothing happened

25:52.384 --> 25:54.010
In fact, it’s even more difficult

25:57.514 --> 25:58.640
Just do what you want

26:06.523 --> 26:09.276
Hey, are you going to fight again?

26:09.901 --> 26:11.945
How old are you, why are you still fighting with others?

26:15.782 --> 26:16.825
That is to say

26:24.124 --> 26:25.041
So…

26:26.751 --> 26:27.752
I go first

26:46.688 --> 26:47.522
Masaaki

26:49.941 --> 26:51.151
But I still want to say

26:51.651 --> 26:53.194
Don't make me wait too long

26:54.154 --> 26:55.739
I thought about it carefully

26:55.822 --> 26:57.616
Found out that I actually don’t have any friends

27:13.173 --> 27:14.424
-Hello, Representative Kim
-Hello

27:14.507 --> 27:16.092
Good morning

27:16.176 --> 27:17.427
Did you get home safely yesterday?

27:17.510 --> 27:19.012
- Yes, Representative Kim
- Huh?

27:19.095 --> 27:21.222
Representative Xu, what happened yesterday?

27:21.306 --> 27:23.058
Didn’t I leave first yesterday?

27:23.141 --> 27:24.017
Yeah

27:24.351 --> 27:27.729
As soon as he walked into the company just now, I was shocked.

27:27.812 --> 27:30.523
-Why?
-You'll know when you go in and take a look.

27:33.109 --> 27:33.985
Please come in

27:37.781 --> 27:40.867
Representative Xu, what happened to you yesterday?

27:42.410 --> 27:43.495
Representative Xu

27:47.040 --> 27:49.626
Oh my God, what happened to your face?

27:49.834 --> 27:52.837
I rolled around in the rose bushes

27:53.630 --> 27:54.506
What?

27:54.673 --> 27:56.966
There are roses planted in the flower beds of our apartment

27:59.260 --> 28:00.762
I rolled around there

28:01.763 --> 28:02.889
how so?

28:03.848 --> 28:04.724
Representative Xu

28:04.808 --> 28:05.975
No, I'm fine

28:06.893 --> 28:09.604
My home has arrived

28:10.313 --> 28:11.606
-Then go in
. -Goodbye

28:20.281 --> 28:21.282
really weird

28:22.158 --> 28:23.034
Not over there

28:23.118 --> 28:24.244
This has to be opened

28:24.327 --> 28:25.870
Representative Xu

28:25.995 --> 28:26.996
The door isn't over there

28:27.080 --> 28:28.206
On your right

28:28.289 --> 28:29.207
OK, bye

28:29.916 --> 28:30.792
good

28:33.962 --> 28:35.505
-Why can't this be opened?
-It's the right side

28:36.506 --> 28:38.341
Right, yes right

28:44.472 --> 28:45.557
Representative Xu!

28:51.813 --> 28:53.022
Representative Xu!

28:53.231 --> 28:54.441
-Representative Xu
-Yes

28:54.983 --> 28:56.151
Are you OK?

28:57.736 --> 28:58.903
if it were me

28:58.987 --> 29:00.530
Can't remember anything

29:01.239 --> 29:02.866
that's better

29:02.949 --> 29:04.033
Alas

29:04.951 --> 29:06.035
Hello

29:06.119 --> 29:09.164
I think Yun Zhao must have suffered a lot.

29:09.414 --> 29:10.331
Alas

29:12.709 --> 29:14.169
Have you been to the hospital?

29:14.252 --> 29:17.630
If you haven't gone yet, you should
go there as soon as possible before the wound worsens.

29:19.340 --> 29:24.262
Also, don’t forget to
treat Yun Zhao to a delicious meal, you know?

29:24.345 --> 29:25.722
Do I have to treat me to make amends?

29:25.805 --> 29:28.183
Alas, of course

29:28.516 --> 29:29.350
Please order something delicious

29:31.478 --> 29:35.523
It looks like you need to stop drinking for a while, you know?

29:50.705 --> 29:53.875
(
Weekly schedule of the Internal Culture Improvement Project Task Force)

29:53.958 --> 29:57.462
Okay, then before the next meeting,
everyone is asked to formulate the questions for the questionnaire.

29:58.421 --> 30:01.424
Can I make a comment?

30:02.717 --> 30:05.762
Compared with
the positive effects of internal culture improvement projects

30:05.845 --> 30:09.098
The company’s employees don’t seem to pay much attention

30:10.350 --> 30:12.227
In addition to our public relations team and human resources team

30:12.310 --> 30:15.438
No one else seems to know
this project is going on

30:15.522 --> 30:17.232
Is it because we just started trying it?

30:17.649 --> 30:19.442
So after thinking about it

30:20.610 --> 30:22.028
came up with one

30:22.111 --> 30:24.989
Activities that can heat up the topic before the survey

30:25.615 --> 30:27.784
It's an anonymous video conference

30:28.368 --> 30:29.744
By holding a video conference

30:29.828 --> 30:33.164
Let employees express their expectations and dissatisfaction with Se Yong

30:33.248 --> 30:36.000
Prepare a space where everyone can talk freely

30:36.793 --> 30:38.711
Attendees basically use nicknames

30:38.795 --> 30:42.841
You can turn off the camera or mosaic it according to your own wishes

30:42.924 --> 30:46.219
It feels a lot like "100 Minutes Discussion"
and can be changed to "Se Yong's 100 Minutes Discussion"

30:47.262 --> 30:49.305
"Seyong Citizens' Meeting"

30:50.181 --> 30:52.183
- Sounds super cliché.
- So cliche.

30:52.976 --> 30:55.353
"Se Yong, I want to know the truth."

30:55.436 --> 30:56.771
Not bad

30:57.397 --> 30:59.816
Let’s shorten this name to

31:00.567 --> 31:01.568
"Shixiang", how about it?

31:03.027 --> 31:04.028
Not bad, "Shixiang"

31:04.487 --> 31:05.947
Does everyone agree?

31:06.739 --> 31:07.574
agree

31:08.366 --> 31:09.242
agree

31:09.325 --> 31:10.368
agree!

31:10.451 --> 31:13.204
Then the person in charge of Sehyang
decided to be Agent Park?

31:13.288 --> 31:14.163
OK

31:14.747 --> 31:17.458
OK, if you want to conduct a video conference within the company system

31:17.542 --> 31:18.626
I still have to have a meeting with the computer team.

31:20.044 --> 31:21.212
OK, end

31:29.387 --> 31:30.471
Are you OK?

31:30.555 --> 31:32.307
Well, it's okay

31:32.974 --> 31:34.726
You seem to be dizzy a lot lately

31:34.809 --> 31:36.185
Have you been to the doctor?

31:36.269 --> 31:37.979
I'll figure it out myself

31:53.369 --> 31:57.540
Please,
can the internal culture of the company be changed by filling out a few questionnaires?

31:57.624 --> 31:59.751
In my opinion, those people end up

31:59.834 --> 32:03.171
Or will they use the company’s internal culture as an excuse
to modify the evaluation mechanism ?

32:03.880 --> 32:04.714
Right?

32:05.256 --> 32:06.341
That’s why the talent will join

32:06.424 --> 32:09.928
Even if the control lies with the public relations office,
we are still indispensable.

32:10.053 --> 32:11.721
Even if that has nothing to do with the evaluation mechanism

32:11.804 --> 32:14.432
Will this year's group evaluation still proceed as usual?

32:14.849 --> 32:15.850
There is news that it will be suspended

32:15.934 --> 32:17.435
That kind of news is actually circulating?

32:18.144 --> 32:22.148
What are you doing? It seems that employees are
quite concerned about the internal culture improvement plan.

32:22.899 --> 32:24.525
This year’s group evaluation will still be conducted as usual

32:24.609 --> 32:26.402
Even if they want to change, they can't do it overnight.

32:27.278 --> 32:29.530
Otherwise, how do they want to change the evaluation mechanism?

32:29.739 --> 32:31.032
Is it going to be like other companies?

32:31.115 --> 32:34.243
Are employees allowed to give scores to their team leaders?

32:34.327 --> 32:36.871
I'm not responsible for the internal culture improvement plan
so I don't know

32:37.413 --> 32:38.957
The leader of that project...

32:39.040 --> 32:40.792
It’s Liu Jae-min’s agent from the Public Relations Team 2.

32:40.875 --> 32:44.170
You should be very clear about his style of doing things.

32:45.296 --> 32:47.340
He really chose the right side.

32:47.423 --> 32:49.175
You should be nicer to him

32:50.009 --> 32:52.178
How nice should I be to him?

32:53.805 --> 32:55.932
I was just too good to him, so he dared to contradict me.

32:56.015 --> 32:58.226
Young people these days are like that

32:58.685 --> 33:00.561
They are different from us

33:00.645 --> 33:04.148
Companies and organizations are not everything to them

33:06.901 --> 33:08.277
Caimin, run quickly

33:08.361 --> 33:09.195
What?

33:10.947 --> 33:12.782
Hello, Xiao Meng

33:13.574 --> 33:14.617
come here

33:15.576 --> 33:16.577
Damn it

33:16.661 --> 33:18.204
Too late

33:21.040 --> 33:22.250
Oh my god

33:26.629 --> 33:28.548
Kill two birds with one stone

33:28.631 --> 33:30.717
Look who's here

33:31.050 --> 33:33.761
The pillars of Se Yong,
the Three Musketeers who support Se Yong in moving forward.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.805
Aren’t they the team leaders?

33:37.598 --> 33:40.935
-(Really, it's true)
-(Really, it's true)

33:41.019 --> 33:43.604
-(Absolutely sincere)
-(Absolutely sincere)

33:43.688 --> 33:46.024
Senior Song, are you on
the executive promotion list this time?

33:46.107 --> 33:48.234
Yes, that's right

33:48.317 --> 33:49.652
Me too!

33:49.736 --> 33:50.611
What?

33:51.154 --> 33:54.240
I also want to be a regular

33:54.532 --> 33:56.993
Xuantai and I both need to be the executive

33:57.076 --> 33:58.453
I'll let you be the executive. You can be the president if you want.

33:58.536 --> 33:59.454
good

34:01.122 --> 34:04.125
You have to be a senior executive this time

34:04.709 --> 34:05.835
so…

34:06.711 --> 34:07.670
Try to win him over

34:12.759 --> 34:14.260
-(really
)

34:14.635 --> 34:16.179
-Damn, you're so awesome
. -You're so perfect.

34:16.262 --> 34:18.306
-You are simply a singer.
-That's right, Chief Meng.

34:19.098 --> 34:20.099
Hello

34:20.725 --> 34:21.768
come here

34:30.985 --> 34:32.278
Come

34:39.494 --> 34:40.495
pick up

34:44.165 --> 34:47.168
Drink this cup and all past grudges will be wiped out.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.004
do you know?

34:53.049 --> 34:56.719
Brother Song, I want it too, I want to fuck you too

34:57.303 --> 34:58.429
You go away

35:00.264 --> 35:01.390
Want a drink?

35:06.312 --> 35:07.230
Really

35:32.421 --> 35:33.256
drink

35:39.679 --> 35:41.973
Hello! etc…

35:44.767 --> 35:47.061
Oh, you stinky boy

35:49.230 --> 35:50.148
Really

35:52.150 --> 35:54.152
Also let me feel the love of Brother Song

35:56.320 --> 35:57.864
Got it, brat

35:57.947 --> 35:59.073
hold

35:59.782 --> 36:02.577
Brother Song, let’s sing

36:02.660 --> 36:05.079
Why are you so presumptuous? Really deserve a beating

36:05.163 --> 36:05.997
Stop it, you brat

36:06.080 --> 36:08.207
Come sing, sing

36:17.592 --> 36:18.718
bring it on!

36:18.801 --> 36:19.635
Come on

36:21.721 --> 36:23.264
(I feel uneasy)

36:24.140 --> 36:27.894
(Someone is chasing me behind me)

36:29.896 --> 36:35.026
(Standing at the edge of the dark cliff, I have no way to retreat)

36:35.109 --> 36:36.402
I love you, Song Xuantai

36:38.446 --> 36:39.614
Send Team Leader Cui home well

36:39.697 --> 36:41.324
Captain Song, please take this car

36:41.532 --> 36:43.117
Do you want to go somewhere else by yourself?

36:43.201 --> 36:45.870
No such thing, I have to go to work tomorrow

36:45.953 --> 36:47.496
-Jai Min, I'm leaving
. -Yes, please walk slowly.

36:47.580 --> 36:50.249
-Bye
-Here, here you go

36:50.333 --> 36:52.627
-Okay, I'm leaving
. -Yes, please go slowly!

36:54.879 --> 36:57.798
Oh, Team Leader Cui, please come here.

36:58.174 --> 36:59.008
Come

36:59.091 --> 37:01.594
Oh, be careful...

37:01.677 --> 37:02.887
Here, be careful

37:05.932 --> 37:08.684
It's time for Team Leader Jia to go home, come on

37:09.602 --> 37:11.062
Be careful!

37:12.480 --> 37:13.564
get home safe!

37:15.733 --> 37:16.859
take care

37:25.868 --> 37:26.702
what?

37:27.453 --> 37:28.788
Why don't you leave?

37:29.914 --> 37:30.998
Do you want to hire a taxi for you too?

37:31.082 --> 37:33.501
-Why are you so good at this kind of thing?
-What?

37:33.918 --> 37:35.294
You're not willing, are you?

37:39.757 --> 37:43.094
I really can't do that

37:43.678 --> 37:47.181
You'll be fine when you become the section chief

37:49.058 --> 37:50.184
Yeah?

37:51.060 --> 37:53.437
Well, we all are like that

37:53.521 --> 37:57.275
Because the people around me have been so virtuous since I joined the company.

37:59.318 --> 38:00.319
correct

38:00.987 --> 38:02.446
You probably don't know

38:03.406 --> 38:04.657
Because you are different from us

38:08.911 --> 38:11.289
Really, you're drawing a line again.

38:11.998 --> 38:14.333
I said that although I was born in the 1990s

38:14.417 --> 38:16.669
But I am more like a person born in the 1980s

38:16.752 --> 38:19.463
(Se Yong)

38:22.300 --> 38:23.592
(Shi Yong, want to know the truth)

38:23.676 --> 38:24.885
"Worldly Thoughts"?

38:28.097 --> 38:29.807
Is it going well?

38:29.890 --> 38:32.810
We have
notified all employees of the date and time

38:32.893 --> 38:35.438
The video conferencing system has also been tested

38:35.563 --> 38:39.191
Even if people are outside the company,
they can participate in the meeting through the link

38:40.609 --> 38:45.448
I am both looking forward to and curious about how the situation will develop in the end.

38:46.157 --> 38:49.160
But one thing I'm worried about is the number of attendees

38:49.827 --> 38:52.455
So I'm thinking about whether to make it mandatory

38:52.538 --> 38:54.165
Send one person from each group to participate

38:54.248 --> 38:55.291
No

38:56.083 --> 38:57.460
Don't take a forced approach

38:57.543 --> 38:59.837
It is better to let employees participate voluntarily

39:02.048 --> 39:04.216
The result of a few people voluntarily participating

39:04.300 --> 39:06.469
Probably more than the hundreds of people who were forced to attend

39:07.011 --> 39:08.220
Comes more real

39:11.974 --> 39:15.978
I'm curious about any company
that invites all employees to participate

39:16.687 --> 39:17.897
Video conferencing?

39:18.647 --> 39:19.815
Probably not

39:27.531 --> 39:28.574
Want a cup of tea?

39:29.408 --> 39:31.243
OK, I'd love to

39:38.000 --> 39:38.918
Director Gu!

39:39.919 --> 39:41.295
There is a guest waiting for you inside

39:42.421 --> 39:43.672
But I don’t have an appointment with anyone today

39:44.298 --> 39:45.716
She said she is your daughter

40:03.818 --> 40:04.735
Excuse me

40:04.860 --> 40:06.904
It seems that tea will have to wait until next time.

40:06.987 --> 40:07.905
no problem

40:07.988 --> 40:09.281
Feel sorry

40:32.555 --> 40:33.431
Hi

40:35.933 --> 40:37.143
good

40:41.313 --> 40:42.481
Hi

40:43.399 --> 40:44.900
I've always been curious

40:45.234 --> 40:48.529
What you do and where you work

40:50.531 --> 40:54.285
When you were in the United States, I couldn't see
or know this.

40:56.537 --> 40:59.123
(Chief Public Relations Officer, Koo Yi-jung)

40:59.582 --> 41:01.208
"Chief Public Relations Officer, Goo Yi-jung"

41:03.419 --> 41:05.421
-Yu Zhen...
-Stop calling me all the time

41:06.964 --> 41:08.757
Don't come and pretend to be familiar with me until now

41:10.342 --> 41:14.763
Since you left because you wanted to live your own life
, then continue to live like that

41:15.681 --> 41:19.310
Don't suddenly
realize that you have a daughter now.

41:20.102 --> 41:22.021
Pretend to care about me

41:22.730 --> 41:23.772
Really disgusting

41:30.488 --> 41:32.990
By the way, I left early today
just to tell you this.

41:34.074 --> 41:36.160
Except for fainting from appendicitis in elementary school.

41:36.243 --> 41:37.745
This is the first time I leave early

41:38.954 --> 41:42.917
Although you probably don't care at all whether I have an appendix or not

41:50.216 --> 41:52.551
You should say sorry at this time, right?

41:53.469 --> 41:55.930
It's hard for you to even talk to me properly.

41:57.306 --> 41:58.849
How did you become a public relations expert?

42:01.018 --> 42:02.603
So chilling

42:31.131 --> 42:32.007
Where are you?

42:40.391 --> 42:42.268
I also left early like you

42:42.351 --> 42:43.936
You said you were lying about menstrual pain.

42:44.019 --> 42:45.020
Where are you?

42:53.153 --> 42:56.282
Hey, no, don't go that way,
I'll tell you to come down!

42:56.365 --> 42:58.158
Just kill them all

42:58.242 --> 42:59.368
Wait, hey!

43:00.327 --> 43:01.161
hateful

43:01.787 --> 43:03.998
Damn it, no matter what, I'm going to kill them all

43:14.883 --> 43:17.886
So did you successfully meet
the woman who abandoned you?

43:18.220 --> 43:20.347
Yeah, it went so damn well

43:20.431 --> 43:22.391
She can't even say a word

43:22.975 --> 43:24.268
Oh shit

43:25.603 --> 43:26.729
You are not suitable for swearing at all

43:28.147 --> 43:30.107
Really? Is it awkward?

43:30.190 --> 43:32.192
Yeah, so damn awkward

43:33.402 --> 43:36.322
If you could learn swear words, I would have learned them long ago

43:37.406 --> 43:38.490
forget it

43:38.824 --> 43:39.825
swear words

43:41.035 --> 43:42.328
This is not the place to rely

43:43.787 --> 43:44.997
The important thing is here

43:46.206 --> 43:47.082
I see

43:47.583 --> 43:50.336
It’s not easy to curse with curse words naturally

43:51.337 --> 43:52.963
Hey, behind the door!

43:53.047 --> 43:54.381
where? I did not see it

43:54.465 --> 43:55.966
Oops, I got hit.

43:56.050 --> 43:58.385
Hold on tight until I kill all those bastards

43:58.469 --> 44:01.972
I'll kill them all before I go to save you.

44:04.266 --> 44:05.643

44:09.813 --> 44:11.190
Task force matters

44:11.273 --> 44:13.901
It should be done without interfering
with your own duties, right?

44:14.276 --> 44:15.277
What?

44:15.861 --> 44:17.529
Because I see you've been doing that

44:18.364 --> 44:21.742
Maybe you worked so hard because it was a project belonging to Director Goo .

44:23.535 --> 44:25.871
I did it without interfering with my duties.

44:30.834 --> 44:33.462
Then go here

44:45.474 --> 44:47.393

44:47.476 --> 44:50.562
We want to distribute nutritional supplements
to residents in local communities

44:50.938 --> 44:52.106
In fact, it’s about being a volunteer

44:52.815 --> 44:54.483
It's up to you this time

44:54.858 --> 44:58.362
Our group needs to send one person to
manage the distribution of items.

44:58.445 --> 45:00.364
Also help with taking photos

45:00.447 --> 45:02.241
But the person in charge here is you...

45:02.324 --> 45:03.867
Let's share the work together

45:04.159 --> 45:04.993
Aren't we in the same group?

45:07.454 --> 45:09.164
how? You do not want it?

45:10.499 --> 45:12.710
No matter what, I am still considered your superior.

45:13.335 --> 45:14.420
Ryu Jae-min is the agent!

45:16.213 --> 45:18.257
-Yes
-Agent Qi, you are here too

45:18.340 --> 45:19.341
Yes, Team Leader Song

45:20.175 --> 45:22.428
I want to bring Agent Liu back to our group

45:27.307 --> 45:30.227
Because the sales manager has been complaining about not having him

45:30.310 --> 45:32.604
The press releases are a mess

45:33.856 --> 45:34.857
right?

45:35.315 --> 45:37.276
They think we just copied the product description

45:37.359 --> 45:39.236
It's not a press release at all.

45:39.695 --> 45:41.488
Do you know that you also misspelled words?

45:47.661 --> 45:48.704
Do you understand?

45:49.246 --> 45:50.247

45:58.464 --> 46:02.134
Because the product formula needs to be promoted again after the upgrade,
I need the right person to be in charge.

46:17.691 --> 46:18.525
Yes

46:19.276 --> 46:23.322
Well, you'll do well
because you're pretty smart.

46:23.947 --> 46:26.909
If you encounter any difficulties during implementation, just tell me.

46:26.992 --> 46:27.993

Didn’t you leave the protein powder case
to me?

48:00.419 --> 48:03.088
It's too hard for you alone.
Let's do it together with Agent Park.

48:04.298 --> 48:06.842
Agent Park, have you dealt with
protein powder related products before?

48:06.925 --> 48:08.510
Yes, you mean high protein bread?

48:09.219 --> 48:11.346
Yes, that product is very popular, right?

48:13.974 --> 48:15.350
There is a correlation between the two, right?

48:15.434 --> 48:17.436
But this is my first case

48:17.519 --> 48:19.104
Yes, I know too

48:19.187 --> 48:20.480
I just want you to do it together.

48:25.110 --> 48:26.945
I hope that I will be the main person in charge

48:29.531 --> 48:32.534
I will try my best to help Jihyo from the side

48:33.035 --> 48:37.831
She has been working on it for a while.
It would be better for her to be the main person in charge.

, but no matter who is in charge
