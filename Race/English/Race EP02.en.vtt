Followed by B Band and U Community.

01:05.607 --> 01:08.944
Instagram users
are mostly male

01:10.070 --> 01:11.280
As for age

01:11.780 --> 01:16.201
Most users are teenagers.

01:16.285 --> 01:17.202
"PR Joea"

01:24.126 --> 01:25.544
Are you tired after waiting for so long?

01:26.837 --> 01:27.713
What about your president?

01:29.590 --> 01:30.841
Coming soon.

01:31.717 --> 01:33.969
They were the last to fight him.

01:35.763 --> 01:36.889
You're used to this kind of thing.

01:38.557 --> 01:41.435
Who puts on an honest face to encourage me

01:46.648 --> 01:48.609
Right here, my president.

01:53.655 --> 01:54.490
Yuncheng

01:57.409 --> 02:00.079
I don't need such encouragement.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.091
- Yun Qiao, are you ready?
- Yes.

02:12.174 --> 02:13.217
OK, let's go.

02:21.725 --> 02:24.019
The last speaker is PR Joa.

02:27.439 --> 02:28.690
"Marketing Team Leader
Gao Dongjun"

02:49.086 --> 02:50.129
a while.

02:50.629 --> 02:52.464
Who will introduce it?

02:53.132 --> 02:54.967
Shouldn't the president be the one in attendance?

02:56.844 --> 02:59.638
Yes, it’s not me,
it’s Manager Park Yoon-joo...

02:59.721 --> 03:01.640
Yes, the chairman is the host.

03:04.476 --> 03:06.937
CEOs of other companies do the same.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.064
Manager Park was the one who came up with this plan.
So she will present it herself.

03:09.148 --> 03:10.232
The president himself said it.

03:11.650 --> 03:13.443
Everyone lets everyone else come up with plans.

03:14.486 --> 03:16.321
Is it that difficult to understand?

03:18.407 --> 03:21.243
Or are you not ready to present yet?

03:31.295 --> 03:33.046
Boss Song called Senior Jin?

03:33.130 --> 03:34.173
To attack her?

03:34.882 --> 03:36.300
So she's really here?

03:36.383 --> 03:39.219
Well, life is hard like that.

03:49.271 --> 03:52.274
Yes, then I will introduce it myself.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.669
《Seyuu》

04:14.546 --> 04:18.383
Not prepared.
Also, there is a lack of sincerity.

04:21.720 --> 04:22.596
what is it?

04:23.847 --> 04:25.098
sorry.

04:25.557 --> 04:26.934
I didn't mean to hear it.

04:28.518 --> 04:29.353
yes...

04:31.021 --> 04:33.565
If you choose not to wear makeup, I understand.

04:34.066 --> 04:35.275
in daily life

04:35.359 --> 04:38.528
But this is just cosmetic work.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.823
This is a press conference.
new cosmetics

04:42.241 --> 04:43.951
You are the president of the company that has come to bid.

04:44.743 --> 04:45.577
But still...

04:46.453 --> 04:47.704
That is...

04:50.707 --> 04:54.169
So,
have you tried our products?

04:55.337 --> 04:58.298
In this way, I will trust you.
How can you do this job?

05:09.768 --> 05:13.438
Sorry, I have sensitive skin.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.899
I hope you can understand.

05:15.983 --> 05:16.984
Haven't used it yet.

05:18.110 --> 05:20.112
But this is really your problem.

05:23.365 --> 05:24.408
Damn it

05:25.284 --> 05:27.661
Am I asking for too much?

05:28.287 --> 05:32.582
I think the expectation is to be professional.
There's nothing wrong with acting professional.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.293
It's so uncomfortable.

05:35.377 --> 05:38.046
Mr. Song, what's going on?
You act like a brat.

05:38.130 --> 05:41.967
This is a hot topic. Just got my Ph.D.

05:46.555 --> 05:47.889
Captain Song Sun Tae

05:48.974 --> 05:50.809
I am Park Yoon Jo from PR Jo Ah.

05:50.892 --> 05:53.395
What I asked is outdated. is there anything you can do?

05:55.147 --> 05:59.693
Other company presidents:
Do you also wear makeup?

06:00.569 --> 06:02.112
They're all men, right?

06:02.321 --> 06:04.823
Oh, or because he's a man.
So I don’t have to dress up.

06:05.657 --> 06:07.159
If you are a true professional

06:07.284 --> 06:11.204
You should wear makeup.
Let's introduce cosmetic work.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.123
Is this true regardless of whether you wear clothes or not ?

06:21.757 --> 06:22.716
May I have your name?

06:23.216 --> 06:24.426
Park Yoon Joo

06:31.099 --> 06:32.351
Let’s take a closer look.

06:41.693 --> 06:43.695
Yes, then let's get started.

06:50.077 --> 06:53.872
"Happy dance"

06:53.955 --> 06:59.044
“Shochu”

07:08.303 --> 07:11.723
By the way, does the President have sensitive skin?

07:12.849 --> 07:14.267
nothing.

07:14.351 --> 07:17.020
I have had great skin since birth.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.982
Compared to the body,
it's just healthy skin.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.951
"I wanted to ask something old-fashioned. Is
there anything you can do?"

07:31.451 --> 07:33.787
Yunjo is braver than I thought.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.915
It's not easy to do that under those circumstances
.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.627
I can not do anything.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.921
This has nothing to do with courage.

07:44.214 --> 07:45.340
I feel so bad.

07:45.924 --> 07:49.094
At least she should give a speech.
Gather experience

07:49.177 --> 07:51.972
He said that the president of another company
showed me this work in person.

07:52.431 --> 07:54.266
The president did the right thing.

07:54.641 --> 07:57.602
In addition, I also practice regularly myself.

07:58.437 --> 07:59.604
It was a good experience.

08:01.440 --> 08:05.402
Their attitude is very bad.

08:05.819 --> 08:10.073
How many more decades have passed?
Power-mad attitudes may never change.

08:14.411 --> 08:15.996
Because we are just supporting actors.

08:17.038 --> 08:19.166
In fact we know and know

08:19.541 --> 08:23.086
But you still have to do your best.
In case they don't like us...

08:24.629 --> 08:25.464
Makes me sad.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.925
Oh my Yunqiao

08:36.641 --> 08:38.768
Sorry, I'm late.

08:40.479 --> 08:41.605
Mr. Earth Communications...

08:42.063 --> 08:43.899
Can I sit with you?

08:44.107 --> 08:45.108
Yes

08:45.317 --> 08:47.486
I haven't seen my senior for a long time.

08:47.569 --> 08:48.904
I said I had to come over for a drink.

08:48.987 --> 08:50.864
- Yeah-
So I asked if I could be in the band too.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.240
Oh, yes, um...

08:52.741 --> 08:54.868
Come sit here.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.036
Ah right?

08:57.913 --> 09:01.249
Did you have dinner with your employees?

09:01.833 --> 09:03.126
Yes, I've eaten it.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.337
It's like they want to go drinking together.

09:05.420 --> 09:09.799
Oh, no wonder you
call me when you have time.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.635
Not because we miss each other.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.595
Come on, I'm thinking about it.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.014
I would like to take care of you myself.

09:16.598 --> 09:18.016
I should make up for my mistakes.

09:18.642 --> 09:21.853
That's not to say.
You should bring your corporate card to use.

09:22.354 --> 09:23.563
Using your own card is another story.

09:23.647 --> 09:25.982
I can assure you, this is my card.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.443
But wait.

09:29.653 --> 09:32.280
Why did you come to feed me?
Pay for my shirt.

09:32.364 --> 09:34.074
You should give me money.

09:35.992 --> 09:38.245
What?
What's going on with you two?

09:38.662 --> 09:39.538
What shirt?

09:40.705 --> 09:43.291
I had a chocolate latte disaster this morning.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.503
Oh, that's where you buy new shirts?

09:47.671 --> 09:49.339
You bought it with my credit card.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.633
This is our company's business card.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.597
Then pay for the food.

09:57.681 --> 09:58.807
Let's drink.

10:16.825 --> 10:18.952
"Celtics Online
and Offline Campaign Plan PR Joa"

10:20.870 --> 10:22.622
You're used to this kind of thing.

10:22.706 --> 10:24.916
Put on an honest face and give me encouragement.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.335
I do not need...

10:28.003 --> 10:28.920
Such encouragement

10:37.345 --> 10:38.888
"Call Yun Qiao."

10:50.734 --> 10:53.528
Unable to contact destination number.

10:53.612 --> 10:55.864
Please leave a message after the beep...

10:59.075 --> 11:00.910
Oh, you haven't come back yet?

11:00.994 --> 11:02.746
I thought we all went back.

11:04.539 --> 11:08.335
Don't be too happy yet.
I'm not going to have a drink.

11:08.418 --> 11:09.544
Why?

11:09.628 --> 11:11.463
The demo is now over.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.590
So what, we ourselves are not present.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.258
I went to see it.

11:16.051 --> 11:18.011
This is a tiring process.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.640
Anyway, I can't go tonight.

11:21.723 --> 11:23.642
Come on, why?

11:23.808 --> 11:25.060
- Can't go
- Why?

11:25.143 --> 11:27.520
Why?

11:27.604 --> 11:29.022
- Stop
- Why?

11:49.000 --> 11:53.380
Really, at that time
, it made me want to cry.

11:53.463 --> 11:54.381
that's right.

11:54.464 --> 11:57.300
- I really understand
- Yeah

11:57.384 --> 11:59.469
But it still hurts.

11:59.552 --> 12:03.556
It's like they want to say
"I got it, then go back."

12:03.640 --> 12:05.725
- They look like this every time...
- I know.

12:05.809 --> 12:07.435
I understand very well.

12:07.519 --> 12:11.064
The boss also wants to drink.

12:11.147 --> 12:14.317
For example, "I want to go drinking with you again."

12:14.442 --> 12:15.402
- Really?
- Yes.

12:15.485 --> 12:18.488
- If I get dumped, can I call my senior?
- Yunjo, we are just supporting characters.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.573
- Congratulations on this auction
.

12:20.657 --> 12:22.158
- He chose...
- Thank you very much.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.326
Earth Communications has

12:24.536 --> 12:25.787
"Marketing Team Leader Go Dong-kyun"

12:25.870 --> 12:28.081
Who will introduce it?

12:28.164 --> 12:32.085
Not prepared.
Also, there is a lack of sincerity.

12:32.168 --> 12:34.587
In this way, I will trust you.
How can you do this job?

12:36.005 --> 12:38.800
- Senior must have really been drinking with me
- He must be there

12:39.551 --> 12:40.719
You know what?

12:40.802 --> 12:42.804
- When that happens, maybe we should meet.
- Yes

12:42.887 --> 12:44.264
The boss is lonely.

12:44.347 --> 12:47.016
- Seniors, you must drink with me.
- Why haven't you called me recently?

12:47.100 --> 12:48.518
- Ha
- I'm very busy these days.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.228
-Are you so busy that you don't have time to call me?
- bring it on.

12:50.311 --> 12:51.604
- It's not like that...
- The President

12:51.688 --> 12:52.731
Yes

12:55.442 --> 12:58.027
President, do you really have no feelings?

12:59.612 --> 13:01.072
That is,

13:01.156 --> 13:02.115
I know.

13:03.324 --> 13:05.660
This is not EarthComm's fault.

13:06.077 --> 13:07.287
Yuncheng

13:07.370 --> 13:08.371
but...

13:09.873 --> 13:12.292
I can't help but be jealous.

13:14.043 --> 13:15.253
Why?

13:16.921 --> 13:18.631
Why do I hate it so much?

13:21.509 --> 13:22.385
I'm already drunk.

13:26.556 --> 13:28.892
Yes, I'm drunk.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.102
Because then I will...

13:34.689 --> 13:35.648
excuse me

13:46.367 --> 13:47.619
but the president

13:49.954 --> 13:50.789
I know.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.458
Oh I see

13:54.876 --> 13:55.877
This circle...

13:56.669 --> 13:58.171
like this.

13:59.255 --> 14:05.011
You are still the seniors and juniors.
EarthComm President Who can be here?

14:05.595 --> 14:07.764
- After everything I went through today
- Yunjo

14:07.847 --> 14:09.015
but...

14:09.849 --> 14:11.226
everything...

14:12.977 --> 14:14.395
everything about it

14:16.606 --> 14:17.899
Is that a little too much?

14:28.743 --> 14:29.869
excuse me

14:39.587 --> 14:40.463
What's wrong?

14:41.297 --> 14:42.632
Let's drink.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.625
"Jiemin"

15:28.344 --> 15:29.804
“Jaemin,
you’ve received a new message.”

15:29.888 --> 15:30.847
"Missed the call from Jae Min"

15:31.139 --> 15:32.056
"say something"

15:32.140 --> 15:33.474
"Jiemin"

15:34.517 --> 15:36.936
Answer the phone before I get angry. I was serious.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.652
Hey, I just sent you a message.

15:45.069 --> 15:45.987
how do you say?

15:46.946 --> 15:48.197
"Cloud
Qiao Utopia"

15:48.281 --> 15:49.908
What did you ask her to say?

15:50.533 --> 15:52.827
"Answer the phone before I get mad.
I'm telling the truth."

15:54.621 --> 15:56.372
She probably wants to meet here.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.291
It was like there was a war going on.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.005
Then I'll go home first.

16:04.422 --> 16:05.423
this

16:05.965 --> 16:07.634
Wherever you go, you call her personally.

16:07.717 --> 16:10.553
Listen, if you do something bad
I confront her to end it all.

16:10.637 --> 16:11.721
Stop putting it off, I understand.

16:13.932 --> 16:15.016
I'm going in.

16:46.381 --> 16:48.132
You are richer than your boss.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.927
Well, bring me the most expensive wine.
It's in the store.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.512
Oh, okay, please wait a moment.

16:56.641 --> 17:00.103
Hey, why are you walking around soaked?

17:00.770 --> 17:01.854
I don't have an umbrella.

17:03.690 --> 17:04.983
You can purchase it here.

17:05.358 --> 17:09.028
Walking in the rain like this,
my head is going to be bald.

17:09.195 --> 17:10.488
not here

17:11.114 --> 17:12.573
This is where things get hollow.

17:12.907 --> 17:14.659
Another plot...

17:20.957 --> 17:22.875
- Let's have a drink first
- Yeah

17:38.808 --> 17:39.642
again?

17:57.869 --> 17:59.328
- This is Yoo Jae Min
- said

18:04.584 --> 18:05.460
Yoo Jae-min

18:09.505 --> 18:10.673
Well, tell me.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.550
This is Yoo Jae Min.

18:18.973 --> 18:20.850
This guy is really bad.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.482
Assistant Jiemin, please help me.

18:27.565 --> 18:28.566
Yes

18:29.067 --> 18:29.984
Congratulations.

18:30.068 --> 18:31.152
Thank you so much

18:31.235 --> 18:32.487
You belong there.

18:32.570 --> 18:34.280
- you know everything
- well done

18:34.363 --> 18:37.116
- good job today
- you seem used to this

18:39.911 --> 18:41.412
That's what makes me angry.

18:42.705 --> 18:44.332
And the most angry

18:57.345 --> 18:58.429
excuse me

19:00.348 --> 19:02.100
Sorry, Yun Qiao.

19:06.062 --> 19:07.188
It doesn't matter.

19:11.067 --> 19:14.403
This is understandable.
Why couldn't he tell her first?

19:15.530 --> 19:16.405
Is it right?

19:16.489 --> 19:18.366
I know.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.992
I just wanted to vent, that's all.

19:23.621 --> 19:25.623
Yes, let it out.

19:26.124 --> 19:28.126
You can yell or cry all you want.

19:28.876 --> 19:31.671
Stop it,
you make me want to cry.

19:32.421 --> 19:34.090
But can I say one more thing?

19:36.342 --> 19:38.386
no matter what the result is

19:38.719 --> 19:42.974
I understand.
How much do you plan to show?

19:44.016 --> 19:45.143
It's really admirable.

19:47.937 --> 19:51.858
Hehe, don’t you give people goosebumps when you say something like this?
Am I the only one?

19:53.943 --> 19:56.571
In my heart, you are number one.

20:00.616 --> 20:02.243
Shut up you idiot.

20:06.497 --> 20:07.540
hold hands and reconcile

20:08.374 --> 20:09.458
It doesn't matter.

20:09.542 --> 20:10.543
You can act like a child.

20:11.294 --> 20:12.170
like this?

20:12.253 --> 20:14.547
Then we made up.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.299
correct?

20:16.382 --> 20:17.383
Ha ha.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.135
Come, let's have a drink.

20:19.844 --> 20:21.053
collision

20:22.763 --> 20:23.598
OK

20:28.978 --> 20:33.191
They say we get three chances in life.

20:33.608 --> 20:34.483
Who said?

20:34.942 --> 20:35.943
I Ching

20:36.611 --> 20:37.445
what is it?

20:40.239 --> 20:44.327
I really thought the opportunity was going to come

20:46.370 --> 20:47.413
But I was wrong.

20:52.335 --> 20:53.794
Really bad.

20:58.799 --> 21:01.677
But who will pay?

21:02.511 --> 21:04.430
- Hey you idiot
- Hey you

21:06.807 --> 21:10.478
- Why?
- You are the richest person in our group.

21:10.561 --> 21:13.522
Didn't I tell you from the beginning
, sir?

21:13.606 --> 21:14.523
Have you told me already?

21:15.608 --> 21:17.276
- How much?
- One million, eight hundred thousand won.

21:19.195 --> 21:20.321
1.8 million won...

21:26.911 --> 21:29.038
Hey, I'm a salaried employee.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.498
Your salary is more than mine.

21:30.581 --> 21:31.540
I'm also at a loss.

21:35.670 --> 21:37.838
Why do I need to make money?
I got so much too.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.384
- Are you joking?
- honestly.

22:00.111 --> 22:01.904
Strategic General Manager
Lin Zhixian

22:01.988 --> 22:04.949
The only daughter of the founder of Serong.
The late Lim Chang-soo

22:08.577 --> 22:09.870
Affiliated to the Strategic Management Department

22:11.497 --> 22:12.957
There is a strategic planning department.

22:13.541 --> 22:14.500
Human Resources Department

22:15.209 --> 22:16.294
Legal Department

22:17.295 --> 22:19.630
and our public relations department

22:21.632 --> 22:23.384
The truth is that the late Im Chang-soo

22:23.592 --> 22:28.806
Create a strategic management department
to give your daughter more power

22:30.975 --> 22:32.268
Because he is worried...

22:32.768 --> 22:36.439
She may not be able to take over the company.
when he died

22:37.023 --> 22:39.400
"Vice President Zheng Jiuying of Shiyong Business Department
"

22:39.483 --> 22:40.568
Yes, sir.

22:41.694 --> 22:44.322
"Seyong, Sales Department,
Kim Yeon-Soo, General Manager"

22:45.239 --> 22:46.115
Why?

22:46.198 --> 22:47.908
Because of Shi Yong’s driving force

22:47.992 --> 22:50.494
This is the vice president of business.
For example, is Zheng Jiuying still alive?

22:50.578 --> 22:53.664
He is also the co-founder of Seyon.
With the late Mr. Lim Chang-soo

23:04.133 --> 23:06.218
The relationship between
Vice President and General Manager?

23:09.430 --> 23:10.473
OK

23:10.931 --> 23:11.807
Look outside.

23:12.683 --> 23:14.560
《Seyuu》

23:30.576 --> 23:33.329
But if you look inside a little bit…

23:33.412 --> 23:35.623
You will know.

23:36.540 --> 23:39.960
A fierce power struggle took place

23:42.129 --> 23:43.130
a while.

23:46.550 --> 23:47.593
Assistant Jaemin, what do you think?

23:47.760 --> 23:48.844
Where are you?

23:48.928 --> 23:50.638
Ha, are you in the conference room?

23:51.138 --> 23:52.431
Ha, can't you see me?

23:52.556 --> 23:53.891
Hey, here it is.

23:57.645 --> 23:59.063
what are you doing here?

24:06.362 --> 24:09.698
What is the manager doing with the intern?

24:10.533 --> 24:12.993
Summary of the situation in the Shi Yong government
. Let them listen.

24:15.621 --> 24:18.207
- Or historical drama introduction
- Bingo

24:19.250 --> 24:21.127
Assistant Jaemin, what's wrong?

24:21.669 --> 24:25.172
Oh, Director Jon from the cosmetics department.
I want to talk to you about the auction...

24:26.507 --> 24:28.509
Now Jaemin's assistant.
You have a responsibility, don't you?

24:28.592 --> 24:29.885
take over from me

24:39.728 --> 24:40.563
OK

24:42.731 --> 24:43.649
OK

24:45.526 --> 24:46.694
He's so cool.

24:47.903 --> 24:50.906
He's going to ask for help again, right?

24:53.325 --> 24:56.412
I had no idea I was coming to the meeting today.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.290
Less than 49 days.

25:01.667 --> 25:02.918
This is not the Joseon era at all.

25:03.502 --> 25:04.336
yes...

25:04.795 --> 25:07.339
It's not like you have to sit by the grave for
49 days.

25:08.716 --> 25:09.592
This is real.

25:14.305 --> 25:17.433
I thought you wanted me to stay
because I had something else to tell you.

25:18.267 --> 25:19.101
be patient.

25:20.102 --> 25:21.770
Be patient and let's work together.

25:23.731 --> 25:24.732
Thanks

25:29.528 --> 25:31.989
She probably doesn't know yet.
Because there’s a lot to think about.

25:32.490 --> 25:33.741
There's bad news.

25:34.325 --> 25:36.118
Just like the public relations aspect,
it's not going to be very effective.

25:36.202 --> 25:38.287
I'm considering moving them.
Affiliated to the business department

25:38.370 --> 25:39.830
I'll handle it myself.

25:41.499 --> 25:42.333
No

25:42.833 --> 25:44.335
I'll handle it myself.

25:46.504 --> 25:47.421
OK

25:55.846 --> 25:57.348
"General Manager of Strategy Department
Lin Zhixian"

26:00.726 --> 26:01.560
"Daguo Daily"

26:01.644 --> 26:03.479
"Bribery auction to
replace Seyon's manufacturer?"

26:10.486 --> 26:11.737
The person in charge of the public relations department was called.

26:13.155 --> 26:14.448
Yes

26:17.201 --> 26:18.035
"Planning Department"

26:18.118 --> 26:19.119
what is it?

26:19.954 --> 26:21.914
We've been discussing this issue for some time.

26:22.414 --> 26:24.041
And the plan we chose...

26:24.833 --> 26:25.668
That's the plan.

26:26.043 --> 26:27.711
"Celtics Online
and Offline Campaign Plan PR Joa"

26:29.088 --> 26:29.922
boss

26:30.005 --> 26:32.383
I know we should choose EarthComm.

26:32.466 --> 26:35.219
But Earth Communications
You can use this plan instead.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.429
I've done this before.

26:38.889 --> 26:41.141
Since creative
media strategy...

26:43.561 --> 26:44.478
This is better.

26:44.562 --> 26:45.938
"Celtics Online
and Offline Campaign Plan PR Joa"

26:46.146 --> 26:47.314
This really happened.

26:47.565 --> 26:49.066
But the other company isn't Earth Communications.

26:49.149 --> 26:50.192
But it used to be.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.194
What about regulations?

26:52.403 --> 26:53.779
There are no rules.

26:53.862 --> 26:56.073
Who do you think the company
didn't win the bid for this job?

26:56.156 --> 27:00.327
Are they going to say, "You don't have to pay us.
Steal our ideas"?

27:00.452 --> 27:03.956
They sell plans
at a fair price, right?

27:04.039 --> 27:05.749
Let EarthComm take care of it.

27:05.833 --> 27:07.626
Whether to pay or not is their own business.

27:07.710 --> 27:10.462
Anyway, let's proceed as planned.
PR Joa.

27:12.590 --> 27:14.758
Boss Song must be frightened.

27:14.842 --> 27:16.594
Gioia’s PR plan?

27:17.595 --> 27:19.388
I didn't expect this at all.

27:20.431 --> 27:22.057
No, say no.

27:22.683 --> 27:24.435
Cosmetics Sales Team Leader
A team, right?

27:24.518 --> 27:25.436
Yes

27:25.519 --> 27:27.813
Only a child would do such a thing.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.566
Where are you from?

27:30.941 --> 27:32.985
I think I'll use this plan.
Can I throw it away?

27:33.485 --> 27:35.195
But PR Joa has a better plan...

27:35.279 --> 27:36.196
damn it.

27:37.031 --> 27:38.115
Don't answer the phone during working hours?

27:41.076 --> 27:41.994
Yoo Jae-min

27:42.077 --> 27:43.537
Will you go with him too?

27:43.996 --> 27:44.830
gentlemen...

27:46.999 --> 27:48.167
Yes, Manager Kim.

27:48.334 --> 27:49.293
what is it?

27:49.835 --> 27:51.337
Yes, I'm on my way.

27:51.837 --> 27:52.880
Yes

27:54.673 --> 27:56.050
Come, follow me.

27:59.178 --> 28:00.638
"General Manager of Strategy Department"

28:01.388 --> 28:02.222
In summary...

28:03.057 --> 28:05.768
You take the money and throw it over your head.
And let it come back to haunt us?

28:05.851 --> 28:07.895
It is not.

28:08.187 --> 28:10.606
They will be releasing new information soon.
Come fix the news and...

28:14.109 --> 28:16.153
No one watches the news.

28:17.363 --> 28:18.697
read.

28:18.781 --> 28:20.240
The Vice President will definitely read it.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.045
Is there nothing?

28:34.630 --> 28:37.675
Let's break
the big news about the good things Seyong is doing.

28:37.758 --> 28:40.886
Our media-loving Vice President would be delighted.

28:42.096 --> 28:44.181
- Boss Song
- Yes.

28:44.264 --> 28:45.599
What's wrong with this?

28:46.975 --> 28:47.810
what is it?

28:50.437 --> 28:51.855
I'll try to think about it.

28:53.816 --> 28:55.150
Who are you?

28:55.609 --> 28:58.278
Assistant Manager Liu Jae-min
from Public Relations Team 2

29:00.322 --> 29:01.532
Yoo Jae-min

29:01.615 --> 29:03.575
Someone who writes a good manifesto?

29:04.576 --> 29:06.704
I'm surprised you remember this.

29:07.413 --> 29:10.499
The general manager is really smart.

29:12.668 --> 29:13.711
What about Ryu's assistant?

29:14.253 --> 29:17.047
Can you come up with great ideas quickly?

29:17.548 --> 29:19.800
drowning in
news about our abuse of power

29:20.718 --> 29:23.011
What other companies do we don’t do.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.013
But we shouldn't imitate them.

29:25.097 --> 29:27.474
What makes us look good and different?

29:40.237 --> 29:42.030
Employment without discrimination

29:45.200 --> 29:47.536
Non-discriminatory employment?

29:49.997 --> 29:51.248
I hear this sound every day.

29:51.832 --> 29:53.333
Are you saying there is discrimination?

29:54.293 --> 29:57.796
This is something every company does.
Except us.

29:59.131 --> 30:01.425
Regarding hiring only experienced people
I think giving employees...

30:01.508 --> 30:03.844
Choose the people you want to work with.
It's not like the others.

30:14.605 --> 30:15.856
OK

30:17.024 --> 30:17.941
be prepared

30:18.025 --> 30:19.735
- Next executive meeting
- Yes.

30:20.319 --> 30:22.696
Then send out a press release
and let the media be everywhere except the "Da Guo Daily".

30:23.489 --> 30:26.116
But General Manager
, if we do this, the consequences...

30:26.200 --> 30:27.701
Then withdraw the ad.

30:29.119 --> 30:30.954
Don't let it trample you.
Take action first.

30:34.666 --> 30:35.876
you can go now.

30:35.959 --> 30:37.002
-I can go.
-Yes.

30:47.888 --> 30:49.681
This is the latest news from Mr. Goo Eui-jung.

30:51.809 --> 30:54.728
Many Korean companies
invited her to participate in this event.

30:54.812 --> 30:56.188
But she refused.

30:57.022 --> 30:59.650
She's your college friend. She might accept...

30:59.733 --> 31:00.818
We hate each other.

31:02.402 --> 31:04.279
There is a big debate about a man.

31:06.114 --> 31:08.242
I haven't spoken to her in over 20 years.

31:08.742 --> 31:11.370

- Are you hungry?

31:26.260 --> 31:27.135
so cute.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.805
She died, just like her mother.

31:29.888 --> 31:30.806
- Very similar
- Yes

31:31.306 --> 31:32.933
Look at those chubby cheeks.

31:33.016 --> 31:35.018
- So cute.
- Oh my god, so beautiful.

31:35.811 --> 31:36.854
but...

31:37.729 --> 31:41.316
From now on, Li Zhezhang's life will be difficult.

31:41.400 --> 31:44.319
Raising a child alone is difficult these days.
Just twins

31:44.403 --> 31:45.529
That's it.

31:45.612 --> 31:48.532
And, with no one to help her,
the work was really hard.

31:49.116 --> 31:50.033
I need to make a lot of money.

31:51.451 --> 31:52.452
It's easy to say.

31:54.746 --> 31:55.747
This is real.

31:56.123 --> 31:58.458
I have more responsibility to take care of myself.

31:58.834 --> 31:59.668
Damn it

- You had a drink.
- Have a good meal.

32:02.462 --> 32:03.380
- Thank you,
good bye.

32:03.463 --> 32:04.339
welcome.

32:04.423 --> 32:05.966
- Hello
- I will definitely wait.

32:07.009 --> 32:09.553
Is this your favorite bakery?

32:09.720 --> 32:11.805
Check it out, it's very popular.

32:11.972 --> 32:14.141

, but it was very popular.

45:50.707 --> 45:51.833
feels good.

45:51.916 --> 45:53.167
Oh, Mr. Yunqiao.

45:53.960 --> 45:55.628
-This is my mom
-ha

45:55.920 --> 45:59.215
I will take you there myself. You go.

45:59.298 --> 46:00.508
Bro, I'm sorry.

46:00.591 --> 46:02.552
Wait, Hua...

46:02.635 --> 46:03.720
deadly

46:06.264 --> 46:08.015
Damn it

46:12.145 --> 46:15.106
Where can I find such a man?

46:15.189 --> 46:17.775
I still have stuff, right?

46:18.151 --> 46:20.319
Go bake with those people.
To prove it?

46:20.403 --> 46:22.905
I still have stuff.

46:24.949 --> 46:25.783
Miss Huajia

46:26.325 --> 46:28.244
As for you, no.

46:28.327 --> 46:30.246
Hey, why have you never dated anyone else?

46:30.329 --> 46:31.581
real

46:32.457 --> 46:34.834
How would you feel if your daughter went to Seyong to work ?

46:35.293 --> 46:36.711
You don't like men?

46:36.794 --> 46:39.756
Women, if you like women, go find them.

46:39.839 --> 46:42.341
I ask you how you feel.
If I go to work in Seyong

46:42.425 --> 46:43.301
So are you bored?

46:44.844 --> 46:46.429
Hello

46:47.722 --> 46:48.806
Wow!

46:52.810 --> 46:53.895
Look for

46:56.731 --> 46:57.648
how do you say?

46:59.859 --> 47:01.235
What do you think I should do?

47:02.111 --> 47:05.531
Should I say no
and no longer work with Se Yong?

47:08.451 --> 47:10.286
damn it.

47:15.792 --> 47:18.085
There is a refrigerator outside.

47:18.169 --> 47:20.087
There's soju in it.

47:20.171 --> 47:21.506
- Go get it.
- Senior

47:21.589 --> 47:22.965
So what do you want to do?

47:28.054 --> 47:29.847
So please tell me what I should do.

47:31.224 --> 47:32.266
Then I'll do it.

47:58.251 --> 47:59.752
I don't know anything else.

48:00.086 --> 48:00.920
Yes

48:01.504 --> 48:02.713
Take Manager Park as an example.

48:04.966 --> 48:06.509
These are all Yun Qiao's masterpiece.

48:10.054 --> 48:13.099
What is most important to the company?

48:14.016 --> 48:15.017
sustainable development

48:16.102 --> 48:19.146
So what makes a company sustainable?

48:19.605 --> 48:23.109
First, a company must have a market.

48:23.192 --> 48:25.570
Selling products and services

48:25.653 --> 48:30.533
Secondly, we must know
what is the financial status of the company?

48:30.616 --> 48:34.370
Will make business decisions
that are always correct

48:34.954 --> 48:36.205
last but not least

48:37.331 --> 48:40.877
The world must still exist.

48:41.502 --> 48:44.422
This is the reason for "SPP".

48:44.505 --> 48:49.093
It stands for environment, society
and governance.

48:49.302 --> 48:51.679
This is important nowadays.

48:52.680 --> 48:55.308
Because of this, we must pay attention to...

48:55.391 --> 48:59.478
All factors
This has a greater impact on SPP.

49:00.563 --> 49:04.025
Make our business sustainable

49:04.108 --> 49:06.193
not just for ourselves

49:06.277 --> 49:07.194
but...

49:07.820 --> 49:09.906
for the future of this world

49:11.157 --> 49:14.285
and our descendants

49:17.371 --> 49:18.205
Thanks

49:19.248 --> 49:20.124
Thanks

49:28.925 --> 49:29.759
Miss

49:29.842 --> 49:31.928
"New York"

49:32.011 --> 49:34.597
You don't have to call the lady.
When the two of us are together it's okay.

49:35.431 --> 49:38.517
They sent me
because I knew we were good friends.

49:40.061 --> 49:40.937
Linda

49:41.562 --> 49:43.689
Thank you for your suggestion, but...

49:45.232 --> 49:47.193
Is there a "but"?

49:48.569 --> 49:50.905
I don't want to hear it anymore.

49:50.988 --> 49:53.199
I stopped playing politics for a while.

49:53.950 --> 49:55.534
There's no big reason for this.

49:56.202 --> 49:57.620
People still want Jenny.

49:57.703 --> 49:58.829
I failed too.

49:58.913 --> 49:59.997
And it was successful too.

50:05.962 --> 50:07.213
are you sure?

50:08.714 --> 50:09.548
Yes

50:13.427 --> 50:14.387
OK

50:14.470 --> 50:17.723
I can't be convinced if Jenny is sure.

50:23.771 --> 50:26.565
Now working as a consultant
How are you?

50:28.526 --> 50:29.735
Excellent...

50:30.611 --> 50:31.570
It doesn't matter.

50:35.491 --> 50:36.534
Jenny

50:38.244 --> 50:39.704
Why don't you take a break?

50:40.663 --> 50:41.706
You look very tired.

50:46.127 --> 50:47.211
you know me.

50:47.878 --> 50:51.048
This is enough to charge your energy up to 100%.

50:58.014 --> 50:59.974
My mission must have failed.

51:07.732 --> 51:08.566
Hey Jenny.

51:30.212 --> 51:31.338
The coffee is delicious.

51:31.464 --> 51:33.340
What brand is it?

51:36.469 --> 51:39.305
I think I told your secretary
not to come.

51:40.431 --> 51:41.891
I don't see any messages being received.

51:41.974 --> 51:43.350
Got it, but didn't pay much attention to it.

51:44.685 --> 51:46.145
- So
- it hasn't changed at all.

51:46.228 --> 51:47.521
Do what you want as usual.

51:47.980 --> 51:49.607
That's my charm.

51:53.903 --> 51:55.237
I want you to help me.

51:58.074 --> 51:59.158
I?

52:04.080 --> 52:05.456
Why should I help?

52:05.873 --> 52:06.707
China Association for Science and Technology

52:07.374 --> 52:09.710
If you accept this job
I will give you everything you want

52:10.461 --> 52:13.047
If you think I'd take a job for the money...

52:13.130 --> 52:14.298
Can you make me kneel down?

52:17.426 --> 52:21.514
I need you more than anyone right now.

52:29.939 --> 52:31.482
"Utopia"

52:31.565 --> 52:35.653
I don’t know if Yin Zu applied.
Didn't get any news at all.

52:35.736 --> 52:38.948
She probably won't tell.
Is it because I'm afraid of being embarrassed?

52:39.198 --> 52:40.116
this is possible.

52:53.420 --> 52:55.840
But I bet she applied for 10,000 won.

52:56.340 --> 52:58.342
Me too.
I bet she applied for 20,000 won.

52:58.425 --> 53:00.970
Are you kidding me?
You have to stab the other person.

53:01.637 --> 53:02.555
you are still working?

53:05.516 --> 53:06.934
Actually I said

53:08.227 --> 53:09.728
They will announce it soon.

53:11.689 --> 53:13.566
I will know if it is announced.

53:13.649 --> 53:14.900
"inbox"

53:14.984 --> 53:16.819
"Forward: List
of applicants who have passed the selection process"

53:16.902 --> 53:17.736
What?

53:19.405 --> 53:20.573
What?

53:20.656 --> 53:22.783
Yeah? You participated too, right?

53:23.659 --> 53:26.078
Tell me, Yoo Jae-min.

53:26.162 --> 53:26.996
Hey, wait a minute.

53:34.962 --> 53:36.964
"Forward: List
of applicants who have passed the selection process"

53:47.474 --> 53:48.684
knock knock

53:49.852 --> 53:50.853
Chairman Xu Dongxun

53:52.688 --> 53:53.606
a while.

53:55.399 --> 53:59.320
The president left work early today.

53:59.653 --> 54:02.823
Today I come to see Mr. Park Yoon-jo.

54:04.700 --> 54:06.285
I? What's wrong?

54:06.994 --> 54:08.329
Do you want to go to dinner together?

54:08.913 --> 54:09.747
Why...

54:10.998 --> 54:15.169
First, I have a suggestion for you.

54:17.421 --> 54:19.006
Have you seen the protein bread sale?

54:19.131 --> 54:20.674
I do it by myself

54:22.259 --> 54:24.428
Now he is well-known in the public relations world.

54:24.511 --> 54:27.223
Everyone wants to know who I am.

54:27.306 --> 54:28.766
This says too much.

54:31.518 --> 54:35.773
It got a little bit of attention.
In the world of digital PR

54:35.856 --> 54:37.107
this is not me.

54:37.983 --> 54:39.401
Promoting protein bread is me.

54:39.485 --> 54:43.030
Yes, I can accept that.

54:43.906 --> 54:45.699
Are you here to tease me?

54:46.659 --> 54:47.660
No.

54:48.118 --> 54:50.496
So let's go have a drink?

54:50.829 --> 54:52.873
From what I understand, your neck is stiff.

54:55.125 --> 54:58.212
Can I ask what the offer is?

54:58.837 --> 54:59.672
Is this here?

54:59.755 --> 55:01.048
Do you want me to stand up and talk?

55:18.023 --> 55:19.775
"Forward: List
of applicants who have passed the selection process"

55:19.858 --> 55:22.194
"Forward: List
of applicants who have passed the selection process"

55:24.321 --> 55:26.031
"Some candidates have been selected.
Three people in total..."

55:30.995 --> 55:32.162
OK

55:33.580 --> 55:35.666
I'm here to invite you to work.

55:35.749 --> 55:38.877
Serve as a leader on one of the EarthComm teams .

55:42.715 --> 55:48.137
