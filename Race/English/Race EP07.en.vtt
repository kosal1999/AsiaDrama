00:37.912 --> 00:40.915
(competition in life)

00:40.999 --> 00:44.002
(The characters, events, groups, organizations
and backgrounds of this drama are purely fictitious. We hereby inform you that)

00:54.554 --> 00:55.680
Who is Park Yun-soo?

00:59.893 --> 01:02.145
( Executive Director Zheng Souhuan, Director of Business Department Marketing Group )

01:02.228 --> 01:05.023
Park Yoon-jo from the Public Relations Team 3 wrote this report

01:05.106 --> 01:06.566
Who is she?

01:17.035 --> 01:19.496
Chief, please calm down first.

01:19.662 --> 01:20.705
Hello, Chi Yinzhen

01:21.372 --> 01:23.917
Is this how you manage your team members?

01:24.626 --> 01:27.921
Is marketing the problem for Cerdix's sluggish sales ?

01:28.546 --> 01:31.007
Why does the report mention marketing concepts?

01:31.091 --> 01:33.593
And how dare you write such a report
and submit it to a senior executive meeting?

01:34.177 --> 01:36.846
I just came back from a business trip and attended a senior executive meeting

01:36.930 --> 01:39.099
And Serdix is ​​the first bill!

01:40.016 --> 01:42.477
Did you know that this was a project that I oversaw from the ground up?

01:42.560 --> 01:45.647
Are you deliberately trying to trouble me?

01:50.652 --> 01:52.028
Nako, Chief

01:52.195 --> 01:54.155
That report is not about marketing ideas...

01:54.239 --> 01:55.532
Who are you?

01:56.407 --> 01:57.575
I'm Park Yoon-so

01:57.659 --> 01:58.660
Are you Park Yun-soo?

01:59.536 --> 02:00.370
Chief

02:00.453 --> 02:03.540
Why are you writing this kind of report?

02:03.623 --> 02:07.377
People in the public relations team just do public relations
without your analysis!

02:12.132 --> 02:13.049
Chief

02:13.133 --> 02:16.511
I think digital PR
is the department closest to consumers

02:16.594 --> 02:18.805
So of course we have to analyze the results…

02:18.888 --> 02:20.306
Really

02:28.606 --> 02:31.484
(This event is also known as
the Zheng Shouhuan Victory of Serdix)

02:32.485 --> 02:36.364
(A few days before Zheng Shouhuan's great victory in Serdix
)

02:36.447 --> 02:38.449
(Episode 7)

02:48.376 --> 02:49.502
Please come in

02:50.837 --> 02:51.671
represent

02:53.715 --> 02:54.841
Masaaki

02:55.341 --> 02:56.217
Are you occupied?

02:59.637 --> 03:01.139
According to the offline activity data,

03:01.222 --> 03:04.642
Questionnaires and responses were unsatisfactory

03:04.851 --> 03:07.103
Social media promotion is almost ineffective

03:08.354 --> 03:10.607
So I looked at the initial sales after launch

03:10.690 --> 03:12.275
It's just terrible

03:13.568 --> 03:16.654
I don’t think there’s a big problem with the event itself

03:16.738 --> 03:19.115
We have ongoing internal meetings

03:19.365 --> 03:23.203
Change and adjust creative marketing techniques and media strategies

03:23.286 --> 03:26.748
This is the first time a key performance indicator has not been met

03:26.831 --> 03:30.168
So why is this event...

03:34.464 --> 03:36.799
The problem really lies in the product, right?

03:37.217 --> 03:39.886
In fact, within our company

03:39.969 --> 03:43.473
The Serdix branding was proposed early in the preparation of the proposal

03:44.140 --> 03:45.683
there are many problems

03:46.768 --> 03:49.646
Not only the packaging design
but also the emphasized product functions are problematic.

03:52.065 --> 03:55.652
So is it really necessary to change the brand identity?

03:55.735 --> 03:57.362
(Brand Identity: Brand Image Integration)

03:57.445 --> 03:59.864
Is it too late to replace it now?

03:59.948 --> 04:03.117
Even a small business
needs to change everything starting from product packaging

04:03.618 --> 04:04.994
It's not easy either

04:05.662 --> 04:06.663
right?

04:10.917 --> 04:14.087
Do you know what it means to change your brand identity now ?

04:14.170 --> 04:17.048
I know, from marketing to promotion

04:17.131 --> 04:19.050
Everything has to be started from scratch

04:19.133 --> 04:22.679
-Do you think this is possible?
-Team leader

04:27.392 --> 04:29.352
if we do nothing now

04:29.435 --> 04:31.938
The situation will definitely not
get better as time goes by

04:32.772 --> 04:33.606
us…

04:34.816 --> 04:35.817
Let’s try it first

04:36.442 --> 04:40.071
But it must be promoted by the cosmetics planning team

04:40.613 --> 04:41.948
They must come forward

04:42.448 --> 04:44.075
(Celdex brand redevelopment project)

04:45.785 --> 04:46.911
What did you say you wanted to do?

04:46.995 --> 04:50.873
If you don’t want to give up the Serdix brand positioning targeting people in their 20s,

04:50.957 --> 04:53.376
We would have to completely revise the trademark and packaging...

04:53.459 --> 04:54.502
no

04:55.420 --> 04:57.964
I know what you mean, it's written here

04:59.507 --> 05:01.301
But you said you want to change the brand identity, what is that...

05:01.926 --> 05:06.055
As far as the current situation is concerned,
no matter how hard we try, we can't sell better.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.849
how do you know?

05:08.308 --> 05:10.018
How can you predict the future?

05:12.228 --> 05:13.146
Agent Park Yun-soo

05:14.230 --> 05:16.691
I don't think you would make this decision on your own

05:20.987 --> 05:22.030
Team leader Chi Yinzhen

05:22.905 --> 05:24.198
I am passionate

05:24.490 --> 05:26.993
Agent Park from your team came here and talked nonsense.

05:27.076 --> 05:28.995
What is going on?

05:29.662 --> 05:31.706
What is nonsense? Have you read the report?

05:31.789 --> 05:34.000
Did you say that after reading the report?

05:34.083 --> 05:35.418
She doesn't even know the basics of marketing

05:35.501 --> 05:38.254
Socializing and drinking with reporters and internet celebrities all day long

05:38.338 --> 05:39.839
Why should I read the information she wrote?

05:39.922 --> 05:42.550
Yes, we drink every day

05:42.633 --> 05:46.554
Because of the bad strategies the marketing team came up with

05:46.637 --> 05:49.932
It’s all up to us to escort and convince!

05:50.350 --> 05:51.559
Are you finished?

05:51.642 --> 05:53.353
-Not yet
-Hello

05:53.478 --> 05:55.480
I am agent Kim Jung-hee from the planning team

05:56.564 --> 06:00.026
We've discussed this before

06:02.153 --> 06:04.530
Compared with the target customer group, from trademark to packaging

06:04.614 --> 06:05.823
It's all too old-fashioned

06:06.783 --> 06:08.409
But the proposals were all rejected by the superiors

06:09.619 --> 06:11.704
That's why we keep silent

06:12.455 --> 06:14.123
It's not because we didn't notice

06:16.542 --> 06:19.420
(Se Yong)

06:26.761 --> 06:27.595
Agent Liu

06:27.678 --> 06:29.597
You just said you wanted to talk to me, what happened?

06:30.640 --> 06:33.017
Is it Park Cheon-ok's agent from a group?

06:33.101 --> 06:37.897
It's because she took maternity leave
that you took her place, right?

06:37.980 --> 06:41.275
-That's said to be true
- What will happen to her after she gives birth?

06:41.734 --> 06:42.860
Haven't you heard?

06:43.444 --> 06:44.779
No, I haven't heard of it

06:44.862 --> 06:46.906
Work in Shirong

06:46.989 --> 06:49.867
People who take maternity leave
are usually transferred to the customer service team, right?

06:49.951 --> 06:51.160
(Customer Service: Customer Service)

06:51.411 --> 06:52.537
Yeah?

06:53.329 --> 06:54.205
right

06:55.081 --> 06:56.999
You don't have this problem, so you don't care.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.334
What?

06:59.168 --> 07:00.169
Alas

07:01.045 --> 07:02.004
you…

07:02.088 --> 07:03.047
How are you?

07:03.131 --> 07:05.216
Can't you go back to the second group quickly?

07:06.175 --> 07:10.346
You are already responsible for many flagship products

07:11.180 --> 07:14.434
The team leader always returns my press releases

07:14.517 --> 07:17.395
It is easier to pass the assessment when handling flagship products

07:18.062 --> 07:19.313
Don’t you want to be a senior executive?

07:19.397 --> 07:20.690
You said that was your dream

07:23.901 --> 07:25.486
Are you feeling very uncomfortable?

07:38.875 --> 07:40.084
Yes, I am Yoo Jae-min

07:41.752 --> 07:44.005
Do you want to complain about protein powder products?

07:44.589 --> 07:45.756
OK, wait a moment

07:49.886 --> 07:51.262
Which website are you talking about?

07:51.345 --> 07:53.389
(Genzyme praise)

07:55.808 --> 07:57.018
“Genzyme…”

07:57.101 --> 07:58.686
(Genzyme praise)

07:58.936 --> 08:00.521
(Genzyme, come together! Fitness men and women)

08:02.982 --> 08:03.900
(This forum is only visible to members)

08:03.983 --> 08:05.234
(register)

08:06.777 --> 08:07.737
"Yoo Jae Min"

08:09.614 --> 08:11.032
I'm telling you, Agent Park

08:11.908 --> 08:13.159
Agent Park

08:14.035 --> 08:16.746
-Yes- Is
this kind of failed product rare?

08:17.330 --> 08:19.332
If you work for a long time, you will encounter a lot of baskets

08:19.415 --> 08:20.750
How could they all succeed?

08:21.375 --> 08:22.418
why did you do this?

08:24.462 --> 08:25.922
This is my first brand

08:27.507 --> 08:28.716
my brand

08:28.799 --> 08:31.093
A brand that I can tell belongs to me

08:31.677 --> 08:33.179
So I want it to succeed more

08:33.262 --> 08:34.430
Alas

08:34.514 --> 08:36.724
I didn't expect to hear this answer

08:39.727 --> 08:41.020
We don’t have such people in our group, right?

08:41.103 --> 08:42.813
No

08:45.650 --> 08:47.610
It must be very tiring to have juniors like this.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.197
So you have to work hard

08:59.705 --> 09:00.873
Go report it

09:01.415 --> 09:02.792
You can report it

09:03.251 --> 09:04.460
But we can't

09:05.127 --> 09:07.880
You go report it, if you can

09:12.093 --> 09:14.512
Absolutely not!

09:14.595 --> 09:15.972
Don’t even think about it!

09:16.055 --> 09:18.182
(Office of the Director of Public Relations Office)

09:24.814 --> 09:25.648
Agent Park

09:26.399 --> 09:28.526
Come with me with the report

09:39.954 --> 09:42.415
Have you told the planning team?

09:42.498 --> 09:43.583
Yes

09:43.666 --> 09:46.919
The planning team has long noticed this problem

09:47.003 --> 09:48.045
So…

09:51.340 --> 09:53.426
This should be reported by the planning team, right?

09:55.011 --> 09:56.762
If you want to change your brand identity

09:56.846 --> 10:01.100
We must first admit that
the current brand identity has failed

10:01.183 --> 10:04.770
All products that have just been launched must be recalled

10:04.854 --> 10:09.191
Also consider the time it takes to design new packaging

10:09.275 --> 10:12.153
Of course, there are also cost considerations for all this.

10:13.070 --> 10:13.946
yes

10:14.030 --> 10:17.325
It is precisely because of the reasons you mentioned

10:17.491 --> 10:20.578
Let me be clear this isn't going to be easy

10:21.370 --> 10:24.081
But regardless of the attribution of responsibility

10:24.373 --> 10:27.293
I think someone has to give an opinion

10:29.378 --> 10:31.714
based on certain circumstances

10:31.797 --> 10:33.841
The planning team said it was unable to report in person

10:34.634 --> 10:36.010
but we can

10:37.219 --> 10:38.179
besides

10:38.262 --> 10:42.767
We think there should be room for improvement if we have your help.

10:53.152 --> 10:56.906
I will study it slowly again

10:58.783 --> 11:00.201
Can you email it to me?

11:10.836 --> 11:14.006
(Se Yong)

11:20.513 --> 11:21.681
I am Chi Yinzhen

11:23.933 --> 11:25.768
I'm Shin Ji-hyo from the Public Relations Team 3

11:26.936 --> 11:28.396
I'm Park Yoon-so from the Public Relations Team 3

11:28.479 --> 11:29.855
The team leader is talking on the phone

11:30.231 --> 11:31.190
Team leader?

11:32.441 --> 11:33.943
Team leader…

11:34.652 --> 11:35.653
What?

11:35.736 --> 11:38.197
Please leave your phone number and we will contact you again

11:38.280 --> 11:39.198
good

11:43.994 --> 11:46.664
Director Koo reported at the senior management meeting

11:47.248 --> 11:48.457
In an executive meeting?

11:48.541 --> 11:50.710
On it is written the name of the person in charge, Agent Park Yoon-soo.

11:55.506 --> 11:56.340
Hello?

11:57.049 --> 11:58.801
Yes, that's right, we report...

11:58.884 --> 12:01.554
No, we don't
want to bring the company to its knees.

12:01.637 --> 12:03.264
We just said what needed to be said

12:03.806 --> 12:06.225
It seems that this matter should not be discussed on the phone.

12:06.892 --> 12:07.893
Really

12:17.862 --> 12:22.116
I heard that even Director Chen didn’t know
that it was something you two planned together.

12:22.199 --> 12:25.119
-What?
-How come the organization is in such a mess?

12:25.536 --> 12:27.705
Don't you know who to report to first?

12:27.788 --> 12:30.249
Do you girls
want to hold hands and play games together?

12:30.332 --> 12:31.292
Chief!

12:32.501 --> 12:35.671
Your little tricks like this
won't make me resign, do you understand?

12:35.755 --> 12:38.382
But you'd better show me clearly

12:38.466 --> 12:40.926
How many people will this report kill?

12:41.302 --> 12:42.303
understand?

13:05.075 --> 13:06.535
That bastard!

13:06.660 --> 13:09.330
That guy actually broke into someone else's territory

13:09.622 --> 13:10.873
What are you doing? What went wrong?

13:10.956 --> 13:12.166
Does the company have that?

13:12.249 --> 13:14.960
What's that called?
There is a "Workplace Bullying Prevention and Control Act"!

13:15.044 --> 13:16.962
Yes, Shirong should have it, right?

13:17.046 --> 13:18.464
I think there should be

13:18.547 --> 13:20.549
I must report him and then submit my resignation.

13:22.343 --> 13:23.344
Pool leader

13:23.427 --> 13:24.428
let's go smoke a cigarette

13:35.272 --> 13:36.440
well done

13:37.191 --> 13:39.360
You made that guy Zheng Shouhuan stumble?

13:39.652 --> 13:42.738
Will insist that the old-fashioned image represents a high-end brand

13:42.822 --> 13:44.365
That's Jung Soo-hwan

13:46.033 --> 13:47.576
Minister Kim doesn’t quite understand

13:47.660 --> 13:49.787
-That's why I trust him so much
- Representative

13:49.912 --> 13:52.039
I don't need to mess with other departments

13:52.122 --> 13:54.500
- Just use this to bring down the marketing team
- Representative

13:55.709 --> 13:59.505
I'm not reporting to you now
who you should take down.

14:00.089 --> 14:03.050
I'm reporting to you
that Serdix must rebuild its brand identity

14:03.133 --> 14:04.176
wrong

14:06.095 --> 14:06.971
Don't rebuild

14:10.307 --> 14:11.725
If you ignore it, you will fail.

14:11.809 --> 14:14.520
When the time comes we can't go back and
we can only give up this brand.

14:14.603 --> 14:17.064
Then give up and let it become a failed brand.

14:17.439 --> 14:19.441
Minister Kim must take full responsibility

14:19.525 --> 14:20.609
I'm happy to see it come to fruition

14:22.528 --> 14:25.656
When striking, it must be fatal with one blow

14:25.739 --> 14:28.200
I have to make the vice president admit his mistake

14:30.119 --> 14:31.078
Park Yeon-jo?

14:32.413 --> 14:33.789
I remember her name

14:34.540 --> 14:36.041
Let Park Yoon-soo help me manage social media

14:36.750 --> 14:38.544
I want to treat her to a meal. You can set a date.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.006
You

14:47.595 --> 14:50.431
All you need to do is fulfill your duties as chief public relations officer.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.183
Got it?

14:53.267 --> 14:59.690
(Se Yong)

15:07.615 --> 15:08.449
Hello?

15:12.620 --> 15:13.495
Director Gu

15:14.788 --> 15:18.626
Cosmetics department executive Oh Byung-geun resigned

15:18.709 --> 15:21.003
Is this the result you want?

15:22.838 --> 15:27.384
And we decided to promote Cerdix as planned

15:29.762 --> 15:30.679
so…

15:31.472 --> 15:37.019
Don't be swayed by a few reports written by an agent-level employee ...

15:37.102 --> 15:39.688
You said not to be swayed by a few reports

15:39.772 --> 15:42.274
Then why would you agree to the resignation of Executive Director Wu Binggen?

15:42.691 --> 15:44.068
that is because…

15:44.818 --> 15:46.695
Initial sales were sluggish…

15:46.779 --> 15:49.031
The reason for the sluggish sales must also be clear.

15:49.990 --> 15:50.908
But

15:51.659 --> 15:54.286
Why should Wu Binggen be in charge of the executive?

15:54.370 --> 15:56.956
Otherwise, who do you want to be responsible?

15:57.039 --> 16:00.334
I never said who I wanted to be responsible

16:00.417 --> 16:01.627
Hey, Director Goo!

16:02.044 --> 16:02.878
Director Kim

16:03.712 --> 16:05.798
What? What did you say?

16:07.174 --> 16:08.926
I just repeated what you said, what's wrong?

16:09.009 --> 16:10.386
Do you want me to not even use honorifics?

16:11.136 --> 16:12.680
you…

16:15.432 --> 16:17.685
“The product we were planning to launch failed

16:18.143 --> 16:22.439
Then someone from the planning team or sales team must take responsibility and resign.”

16:23.148 --> 16:26.360
If this is the company culture,
is there any employee with a broken head?

16:26.777 --> 16:27.945
Would you be willing to be responsible for that product?

16:28.028 --> 16:31.073
Which employee will come up with great ideas for merchandise?

16:31.156 --> 16:32.032
Hello

16:32.116 --> 16:34.243
You don’t understand anything, why should you talk?

16:34.326 --> 16:36.161
Just be your CCO!

16:39.748 --> 16:41.041
Do you know what that means?

16:41.208 --> 16:42.292
What?

16:43.919 --> 16:47.423
If you don’t know, just say you don’t know, why are you yelling?

16:47.506 --> 16:50.050
Also, please be polite when you talk to me.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.886
I'm an executive director like you

16:55.431 --> 16:56.306
I can't stand it

17:00.978 --> 17:01.854
Hello!

17:03.063 --> 17:03.897
besides

17:03.981 --> 17:08.152
I don't smoke. Don't ask me to come here again.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.615
That bastard...

17:32.426 --> 17:33.427
for you

17:38.640 --> 17:39.850
Thanks

17:44.354 --> 17:45.439
Cosmetics department

17:45.856 --> 17:47.524
It's such a mess

17:47.608 --> 17:49.318
That was not my intention in giving the report

17:49.401 --> 17:52.654
But they were totally pissed off

17:52.988 --> 17:56.200
The final decision-maker is Director of the Marketing Group Jung Soo-hwan

17:56.283 --> 17:59.286
But he escaped unscathed and
passed all the responsibility on to them.

17:59.369 --> 18:01.789
They say this is Zheng Shouhuan's great victory in Serdix

18:01.872 --> 18:05.250
Because he was about to be promoted to the head of the Strategy Headquarters,
but now he was being slandered.

18:05.667 --> 18:08.754
If he is not careful,
he may fall into the abyss.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.632
Will anything change?

18:11.715 --> 18:14.760
Director Goo reported it at the senior management meeting

18:16.386 --> 18:17.513
Agent Park

18:18.097 --> 18:19.973
Someone has to take responsibility first

18:20.057 --> 18:21.934
Only then will there be the next step

18:22.351 --> 18:24.895
"Okay, that's it

18:24.978 --> 18:26.897
Failed? Change them all.”

18:26.980 --> 18:28.273
Do you think this is possible?

18:28.357 --> 18:32.569
The person who talks about cost and efficiency most often is the vice president

18:32.903 --> 18:35.239
There's no way he could nod in agreement

18:37.991 --> 18:39.576
Have you seen the nonsense posts?

18:39.701 --> 18:42.079
What's wrong? What did they say again?
Do you want me to resign?

18:42.162 --> 18:44.039
No, it's not like that

18:45.040 --> 18:46.667
They say you are the Joan of Arc of the world

18:47.543 --> 18:50.337
Oh, what a corny metaphor, ugh

18:52.172 --> 18:55.926
Because you bravely brought up
what everyone knew but didn’t say anything.

18:56.885 --> 18:58.303
What's the use of just bringing it up?

18:58.387 --> 19:00.389
But this has never happened before

19:00.764 --> 19:04.476
There is also a team leader who will not ignore the opinions of employees
and will advance or retreat with you.

19:05.769 --> 19:06.812
Pool leader

19:08.355 --> 19:09.356
what to do?

19:09.731 --> 19:13.068
And directors who report at senior executive meetings

19:14.486 --> 19:15.946
director

19:19.741 --> 19:21.326
director

19:31.128 --> 19:32.004
What are you doing?

19:33.755 --> 19:34.673
right

19:34.756 --> 19:37.384
You need this kind of fun at work

19:47.102 --> 19:50.439
Then Agent Park, see you next time

19:50.939 --> 19:51.815
- Come here
- See you next time

19:51.899 --> 19:52.774
come over

19:54.610 --> 19:55.444
come over

19:58.238 --> 19:59.323
It's not what you think

19:59.406 --> 20:00.824
What? Not what?

20:00.908 --> 20:02.576
You just looked like childhood sweethearts

20:04.745 --> 20:05.996
Yes, we are childhood sweethearts

20:08.624 --> 20:11.001
You finally confessed, how many days have you been dating?

20:11.084 --> 20:12.085
no…

20:13.462 --> 20:15.589
Park Yunzhao and I have known each other since elementary school.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.634
Classmates from Hongguo Elementary School and Hongguo Junior High School

20:19.301 --> 20:24.056
We have been friends for many years and
there is absolutely no way we can become lovers

20:24.139 --> 20:26.225
-understand?
-wrong…

20:26.308 --> 20:28.101
No, this is impossible, no...

20:28.185 --> 20:29.895
And I have someone I like

20:30.354 --> 20:31.230
So don’t make random arrangements

20:31.313 --> 20:33.565
No, you're lying

20:33.649 --> 20:34.691
wrong…

20:35.317 --> 20:37.152
Do you need to be so surprised?

20:38.862 --> 20:40.197
I really like to make a fuss

20:40.280 --> 20:41.323
Come here quickly

20:41.406 --> 20:43.408
I have God-given intuition, I can't possibly make a mistake

20:43.492 --> 20:45.410
No, this is a lie, you are lying to me

20:45.494 --> 20:47.037
This is not true…

20:47.120 --> 20:50.207
(Se Yong)

20:58.674 --> 21:00.884
I heard that Executive Wu has submitted his resignation.

21:03.387 --> 21:06.348
-Who said that?
- Agent Kim Chung Hee told me just now

21:06.932 --> 21:09.935
She said that the entire team leader may be resigning soon.

21:12.396 --> 21:13.272
What to do now?

21:14.356 --> 21:15.524
What else can be done?

21:16.525 --> 21:17.818
They can only survive in their respective positions

21:20.195 --> 21:21.905
That's all we can do

21:29.413 --> 21:30.580
Agent Park

21:31.999 --> 21:35.085
One of the things I hate the most

21:35.544 --> 21:38.547
It's just that there is a reporting system
but some people don't take it seriously and do whatever they want.

21:39.006 --> 21:42.926
The company will not
differentiate between agents, section chiefs, and department heads for no reason.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.512
I think today is an exception

21:46.638 --> 21:50.350
Have you come to our office in person?

21:52.227 --> 21:53.228
so what?

21:53.312 --> 21:55.981
I don't think it should be because of me and this report

21:56.356 --> 21:59.359
Let the sales team or planning team take responsibility

21:59.443 --> 22:02.154
If someone has to take responsibility,
I will take it up

22:02.237 --> 22:03.780
I think this is right

22:07.492 --> 22:08.327
Agent Park

22:09.161 --> 22:11.621
-Yes
-Why are you responsible?

22:13.332 --> 22:17.210
Those who shoulder the responsibility should be held responsible

22:17.294 --> 22:18.712
but you…

22:21.465 --> 22:22.674
you are nothing

22:23.467 --> 22:24.509
This sentence means

22:24.593 --> 22:27.846
You are nothing, you cannot be responsible for anything

22:33.560 --> 22:34.895
Agent Park Yun-soo

22:36.021 --> 22:37.606
Take a good look carefully

22:38.315 --> 22:40.859
What are the consequences of being pretentious?

22:42.736 --> 22:44.112
you can go out

23:04.257 --> 23:05.675
It seems you are going to get off work

23:07.052 --> 23:07.886
right

23:10.305 --> 23:11.306
Park Yeon-jo?

23:12.140 --> 23:15.852
She came to me just now and said that she would be responsible

23:16.353 --> 23:17.813
Really shocking

23:18.522 --> 23:20.232
Does she really not understand how the company works?

23:20.899 --> 23:23.402
Or is it because she worked in an agency before?

23:35.622 --> 23:38.834
What would you do if Serdix's situation didn't improve ?

23:39.376 --> 23:40.252
What?

23:40.752 --> 23:42.504
If you mess up in the end

23:43.004 --> 23:46.758
Who do you think the Vice President or Executive Kim
will hold accountable?

23:54.391 --> 23:57.018
(Se Yong)

24:15.704 --> 24:16.913
-I'll leave first
. -Okay

24:16.997 --> 24:18.498
- Be careful on the road
- Goodbye

24:18.582 --> 24:20.792
(Ang’s Bakery)

24:24.004 --> 24:25.005
Masaaki

24:30.469 --> 24:32.512
How are you doing?

24:32.846 --> 24:36.766
Director Park, I heard you went to a good place
, no wonder you look rosy...

24:40.562 --> 24:42.105
Working in a big company is tiring, right?

24:42.397 --> 24:44.608
Of course, it must be very tiring

24:44.900 --> 24:46.860
No, I'm fine

24:52.073 --> 24:53.158
come on

24:54.326 --> 24:55.535
Thanks

25:09.925 --> 25:11.635
Hello

25:11.968 --> 25:14.971
Take your time, okay? drink slowly

25:15.055 --> 25:16.640
This hurts the stomach

25:17.307 --> 25:19.351
It doesn't matter if I hurt my stomach

25:19.434 --> 25:20.894
That's nothing

25:21.937 --> 25:25.815
I caused all the team leaders to suffer for no reason

25:26.650 --> 25:29.152
Didn't the planning team ask you to report it?

25:29.569 --> 25:30.529
That's still my fault

25:32.822 --> 25:35.075
They also made a choice

25:35.158 --> 25:37.827
Otherwise, how could all the team leaders agree?

25:37.911 --> 25:38.912
But I still have a responsibility

25:43.500 --> 25:45.418
I said I would be responsible

25:46.002 --> 25:47.420
Then they said no

25:48.046 --> 25:49.714
Because I am not yet in a responsible position

25:49.798 --> 25:51.132
That's true

25:52.259 --> 25:54.261
I'm really sad

25:57.430 --> 25:58.473
represent

25:58.640 --> 25:59.683
Well, I'm listening

26:00.183 --> 26:01.059
represent

26:01.142 --> 26:02.769
OK, tell me

26:12.696 --> 26:13.780
You

26:15.073 --> 26:17.701
All you need to do is fulfill your duties as chief public relations officer.

26:17.784 --> 26:19.744
You don’t understand anything, why should you talk?

26:19.828 --> 26:21.705
Just be your CCO!

26:32.674 --> 26:35.218
Internal culture improvement plan?

26:35.802 --> 26:39.014
This is a plan to renew and reform the internal culture

26:40.265 --> 26:43.059
As chief public relations officer, I
must do my job well

26:44.811 --> 26:47.522
You also said that you want to be a good communicator

26:47.647 --> 26:49.482
Internal culture?

26:49.566 --> 26:54.571
I want to improve employee engagement through this project

26:54.654 --> 26:56.114
Good intention

26:56.990 --> 26:57.866
Go push it

26:58.366 --> 26:59.326
OK

27:02.203 --> 27:03.079
correct

27:03.955 --> 27:05.624
About Serdix…

27:06.625 --> 27:08.835
I think the font size can be larger

27:08.918 --> 27:10.462
-Okay
-Please.

27:24.476 --> 27:25.393
Hello?

27:26.853 --> 27:27.729
yes

27:31.149 --> 27:32.400
Really?

27:32.692 --> 27:34.194
Is it true? Team leader

27:37.072 --> 27:39.282
That's great, bye

27:41.785 --> 27:42.827
Agent Park

27:42.952 --> 27:45.205
The company decided to rebuild Seldex

27:47.582 --> 27:49.334
I heard it was the vice president's decision.

27:51.628 --> 27:53.254
All group leaders will remain in office

27:54.631 --> 27:55.715
she will stay

27:57.133 --> 27:58.635
I just received the report

27:59.260 --> 28:02.222
They decided to overhaul
Serdix’s brand identity

28:02.931 --> 28:04.307
their whole weekend

28:04.391 --> 28:06.142
All are simulating and evaluating cost efficiency

28:06.559 --> 28:07.560
but…

28:07.644 --> 28:10.063
how? Any questions?

28:10.146 --> 28:13.024
The person who convinced the vice president was Zheng Shouhuan

28:13.692 --> 28:16.611
This means that the vice president
ultimately sided with Jung Soo Hwan.

28:18.321 --> 28:19.781
In this case

28:19.864 --> 28:23.159
Only Executive Wu resigned inexplicably
and I gained nothing.

28:23.243 --> 28:26.996
It was you who founded the brand Serdix

28:27.080 --> 28:29.749
If Serdix succeeds,
it's all your fault.

28:32.335 --> 28:34.045
My dad was still alive before

28:34.629 --> 28:37.090
When I was the head of the strategy department,
I felt much more relaxed.

28:39.092 --> 28:40.468
(Representative Seo Dong-hun)

28:40.552 --> 28:43.304
It’s not just because of this project

28:43.388 --> 28:45.056
I'm just a little tired

28:45.890 --> 28:49.018
No matter how hard you try, as long as the customer is not satisfied

28:49.102 --> 28:51.938
Months and weeks of our efforts
were all in vain.

28:52.522 --> 28:54.733
I know this is the norm for agencies

28:55.483 --> 28:56.693
But it’s too hard

28:57.944 --> 28:59.696
Have you considered taking a break first?

28:59.779 --> 29:01.322
I'll take a break and come back

29:01.990 --> 29:03.283
Will things change?

29:04.075 --> 29:06.244
More work, less pay

29:06.327 --> 29:09.122
I don't think this fundamental issue will change

29:10.707 --> 29:12.542
The representatives are good people.

29:12.625 --> 29:14.294
So I have been troubled for a long time

29:30.268 --> 29:35.064
Director Chen does have the habit of talking nonsense when he is excited.

29:35.899 --> 29:36.816
Is it bad?

29:38.818 --> 29:42.113
How exactly do you work?

29:42.781 --> 29:43.823
I…

29:44.365 --> 29:46.201
How much I cherish global communication

29:46.284 --> 29:47.869
You made it so bad for me?

29:48.870 --> 29:50.121
Nako, Chief...

29:50.205 --> 29:52.081
If Global Communications does good things

29:52.165 --> 29:54.209
This result will never occur

29:54.292 --> 29:57.295
You should run the event well and increase sales.

29:57.378 --> 29:59.547
That's why I hired you!

29:59.631 --> 30:00.757
sorry

30:03.092 --> 30:07.180
You have some bad employees
to make things like this, right?

30:07.847 --> 30:12.352
I want to call all the people in and
listen to them reflect on their mistakes one by one.

30:12.435 --> 30:13.311
No

30:13.937 --> 30:14.813
please don't do this

30:14.896 --> 30:15.814
What did you say?

30:16.397 --> 30:17.273
This is my fault

30:18.274 --> 30:21.986
You are disappointed by the failure to achieve the results you expected

30:24.113 --> 30:25.323
it's all my fault

30:25.990 --> 30:26.908
sorry

30:33.456 --> 30:35.458
This is the fate of agents

30:36.960 --> 30:39.754
Speaking of which, what should Director An do?

30:40.630 --> 30:42.090
she looks tired

30:42.340 --> 30:44.175
What can we do for her?

30:44.259 --> 30:47.637
Is there any other way but to accept her resignation ?

30:48.221 --> 30:51.057
Actually, I've been worried about this for a long time.

30:52.392 --> 30:55.937
“How can we make Global Communications employees
feel proud of their work?

30:56.020 --> 30:59.065
How do you keep them
from feeling discouraged by staying in an agency? "

31:00.775 --> 31:02.068
-Senior
-What's wrong?

31:02.151 --> 31:05.071
Should we introduce a flexible salary incentive system?

31:05.738 --> 31:07.657
Employees decide their own workload

31:08.157 --> 31:09.367
let them get it

31:09.450 --> 31:11.494
Better than the annual salary of big companies

31:12.662 --> 31:14.831
Great, that's a good idea

31:16.040 --> 31:19.294
But that may increase the competitive atmosphere within the company

31:20.295 --> 31:21.671
But you can still consider it

31:22.422 --> 31:24.549
We can gradually improve the system

31:25.425 --> 31:27.302
(Lin Zhixian represents the social media management project)

31:28.386 --> 31:31.848
I revised and sorted out this plan
at your request

31:31.931 --> 31:34.309
1. Content of the post

31:34.392 --> 31:35.977
2. Frequency of posting

31:36.060 --> 31:38.146
3. Risk

31:38.229 --> 31:39.731
(Management Policy)

31:39.814 --> 31:40.690
learn

31:41.649 --> 31:42.817
very nice

31:44.319 --> 31:46.946
- Then I'll forward it to the representative.
- Okay.

31:47.780 --> 31:49.991
(New email, Representative Lin Zhixian)

31:50.074 --> 31:51.075
(Lin Zhixian represents the social media management project)

31:52.952 --> 31:53.828
let's go

31:54.621 --> 31:55.747
Wait, Director

31:56.331 --> 31:58.583
I wanted to thank you about Serdix.

31:59.334 --> 32:00.376
if there was not you…

32:00.460 --> 32:04.339
I just did what I had to do

32:05.465 --> 32:09.469
So you don't have to thank me

32:09.969 --> 32:10.887
but…

32:11.304 --> 32:13.890
if it weren't for you

32:14.682 --> 32:16.476
nothing will change

32:17.310 --> 32:19.562
That’s why the company should thank you

32:19.646 --> 32:20.521
Right?

32:21.105 --> 32:22.148
director

32:22.565 --> 32:24.317
We're going to be late, let's go

32:24.609 --> 32:25.485
OK

32:27.654 --> 32:30.156
Welcome, Park Yoon-so!

32:32.367 --> 32:33.201
Thanks

32:36.579 --> 32:38.289
- Sit down
- Okay

32:43.419 --> 32:45.880
I don’t know about today’s non-menu dishes.

32:46.381 --> 32:48.174
There's only one menu here, you know that right?

32:48.257 --> 32:49.300
Know

32:49.717 --> 32:52.095
And your social media plan

32:52.178 --> 32:53.805
I've seen it

32:54.305 --> 32:56.307
There are too many things I'm not allowed to do.

32:56.641 --> 32:57.475
look at this

32:57.558 --> 32:59.394
“Don’t post too frequently

32:59.477 --> 33:01.187
You may be left with messages attacking
company representatives for doing nothing.”

33:01.270 --> 33:02.438
That's no problem

33:03.147 --> 33:05.066
"Don't upload personal collections

33:05.149 --> 33:08.152
When a company does not perform well, it may be reprimanded

33:08.236 --> 33:11.030
A maximum of two posts related to celebrity artists can be posted in a month

33:11.114 --> 33:12.323
Posts about working in the office

33:12.407 --> 33:14.909
Be aware of stacked files”

33:17.912 --> 33:20.039
-I just don’t want to run social media anymore
. -That’s it.

33:20.790 --> 33:22.959
If you don’t have the confidence to comply
, it’s better not to start.

33:26.462 --> 33:27.922
Park Yun Zhao, do you think so too?

33:28.006 --> 33:28.965
I hope

33:29.674 --> 33:31.092
you can start a business

33:32.010 --> 33:34.012
There are research results showing

33:34.095 --> 33:37.432
The behavior of representatives will not only affect the corporate image

33:37.515 --> 33:40.351
Even the customer’s favorability towards the product

33:40.435 --> 33:42.103
will also be significantly affected

33:42.186 --> 33:43.271
That's right

33:43.938 --> 33:46.441
Yes, Elon Musk also loves to post.

33:47.608 --> 33:48.776
Just do it

33:49.277 --> 33:50.695
This is what I propose, just do it

33:50.778 --> 33:54.365
But don't be too rigid, okay?

33:54.949 --> 33:55.825
Do you agree?

33:59.328 --> 34:00.621
What are you doing? Why are you looking at her?

34:01.205 --> 34:02.498
Look at me, okay?

34:04.167 --> 34:06.127
The PR office publishes three articles a week...

34:06.753 --> 34:11.340
No, it's what you want to write anyway
, so give me some free space, okay?

34:11.424 --> 34:12.341
OK

34:12.425 --> 34:16.179
People definitely want to see
the representative’s daily life and private appearance.

34:16.262 --> 34:17.180
That's right!

34:17.889 --> 34:21.059
Oh, Park Yun Zhao, I'm gradually developing a crush on you.

34:21.434 --> 34:22.560
Thanks

34:22.643 --> 34:24.437
Okay, now let's eat

34:24.771 --> 34:25.897
They have been waiting for a long time

34:52.173 --> 34:54.258
Jump like this

34:56.552 --> 34:58.262
-Hey, the sky is really beautiful
. -Yes.

34:58.638 --> 35:00.556
-We are beautiful.
-Yu Zhen dances so well.

35:00.640 --> 35:02.683
Hey, I've made a lot of progress after learning from Yu Zhen

35:02.767 --> 35:05.061
Yes, I can finally see your dancing skills

35:05.144 --> 35:07.730
Hey, I really improved a lot after Yu Zhen taught me

35:07.814 --> 35:09.482
Yes, a lot of progress has been made

35:09.565 --> 35:11.609
To be honest, I didn't dare to say it before

35:11.692 --> 35:13.027
You dance very well now

35:31.712 --> 35:33.506
-Are you in love?
-How can it be?

35:34.423 --> 35:35.341
How is it impossible?

35:35.800 --> 35:38.261
You have everything, it’s not an exaggeration to fall in love

35:38.928 --> 35:40.138
What does it mean that I have everything?

35:42.974 --> 35:44.100
Your family is rich, right?

35:45.226 --> 35:47.103
You occasionally take your dad's car to school in the morning

35:47.687 --> 35:49.230
Isn’t that a super expensive imported car?

35:49.981 --> 35:51.107
besides

35:51.774 --> 35:53.943
You have good grades and a smart mind

35:54.026 --> 35:55.111
dance well

35:55.945 --> 35:57.113
Looks beautiful

35:57.738 --> 35:59.157
It's just perfect

35:59.240 --> 36:00.992
Look, you have it all

36:01.576 --> 36:04.328
You are the complete opposite of me...

36:06.330 --> 36:09.083
What's this? Actually sending a text message?
Is she from the Joseon era?

36:09.584 --> 36:10.418
(Yoo Jin, mom has returned to Korea)

36:10.501 --> 36:11.419
(You didn’t answer the phone, so I sent you a text message)

36:11.502 --> 36:12.336
(Are you free right now?)

36:12.420 --> 36:13.796
Her name is Goo Yi Jung

36:14.714 --> 36:17.175
After giving birth to me, he abandoned me when I was two years old

36:17.967 --> 36:19.302
People who go to study abroad

36:22.889 --> 36:24.390
She returned to Korea a while ago

36:24.473 --> 36:25.766
so

36:25.850 --> 36:27.727
Are you so angry that you don’t want to contact her?

36:28.144 --> 36:29.020
Um

36:29.562 --> 36:31.147
I'm almost mad

36:32.565 --> 36:33.649
Then why don't you delete the message?

36:39.488 --> 36:40.656
In short

36:40.907 --> 36:43.409
What's the use of her mother if she only gets into trouble ?

36:44.160 --> 36:45.870
Maybe it would be better without a mother

36:52.501 --> 36:53.336
I thought so

36:58.299 --> 36:59.675
Hey, let's go

36:59.967 --> 37:01.385
Let's go, it's time to ring the clock

37:02.845 --> 37:04.138
Let's go

37:06.265 --> 37:08.142
Section Chief Meng knows? How does he know?

37:09.185 --> 37:10.853
- I told him
- Hello

37:13.147 --> 37:15.316
He always misunderstands our relationship

37:15.691 --> 37:17.485
It's troublesome to lie all the time

37:22.907 --> 37:24.450
Hey, by the way, that Representative Xu

37:25.326 --> 37:27.370
When you were drunk at that time, I took you home

37:27.453 --> 37:28.746
I talked to him on the phone

37:29.705 --> 37:31.165
He is worried about you

37:31.916 --> 37:34.085
He seems to have a crush on you, right?

37:35.586 --> 37:36.629
There's none?

37:37.505 --> 37:38.506
There should be

37:39.006 --> 37:40.841
I can tell at a glance

37:42.343 --> 37:43.219
No

37:43.302 --> 37:46.055
Come on, it seems he hasn't confessed to you yet

37:46.847 --> 37:49.350
No, why are there such people these days?

37:50.059 --> 37:51.644
An American-style guy like him

37:51.727 --> 37:54.563
You usually go to the other person directly for a date, right?

37:55.481 --> 37:56.482
I already told you that's not the case

37:57.358 --> 37:59.610
how about you? What do you think?

38:00.069 --> 38:02.822
If you are also interested in him,
then take the initiative to ask him out.

38:03.906 --> 38:05.116
(I)

38:05.950 --> 38:06.826
Hello, Yoo Jae-min

38:06.909 --> 38:09.078
how? You don't like him?

38:12.248 --> 38:14.250
Yeah, I don't like him very much

38:14.959 --> 38:16.752
I don't know why I just don't like him

38:16.836 --> 38:18.004
Do you want to date me?

38:20.464 --> 38:21.716
-Um?
-Um?

38:21.799 --> 38:23.134
What?

38:28.681 --> 38:29.682
Date me?

38:30.641 --> 38:31.517
Um

38:35.521 --> 38:36.397
OK

38:38.190 --> 38:40.693
Go on a date, or just pretend

38:40.776 --> 38:42.862
Hey, I’m almost dying of loneliness when I’m single.

38:42.945 --> 38:44.238
This is the benefit of having friends

38:51.829 --> 38:52.705
I'm not joking

38:53.372 --> 38:54.415
What?

38:55.082 --> 38:56.208
I said I wasn't kidding

39:03.966 --> 39:05.926
-What?
-Don't ask anymore

39:09.138 --> 39:10.097
I…

39:12.308 --> 39:13.309
Never thought about it

39:13.768 --> 39:16.562
I would
say this kind of thing in broad daylight and in the company tea room.

39:16.645 --> 39:17.605
Then don't say it

39:20.983 --> 39:22.860
Don't say it, Yun Zhao

39:29.325 --> 39:30.284
Do not say

39:45.674 --> 39:52.681
(rest area)

40:06.529 --> 40:08.614
(Se Yong)

40:16.038 --> 40:18.165
I first got off work

40:36.350 --> 40:37.935
Jaemin, are you free?

40:38.602 --> 40:39.478
Are you free?

40:39.937 --> 40:42.022
Do you want to go for a drink?

40:42.356 --> 40:43.399
Cai Min

40:45.734 --> 40:46.735
What are you looking at?

40:47.486 --> 40:48.529
Let's go

41:07.965 --> 41:10.801
Where are you going? You don't usually take the bus, right?

41:11.927 --> 41:14.346
Are you going to Utopia? go together

41:17.141 --> 41:18.559
Hello, Xiao Zhao

41:18.642 --> 41:21.312
You go to Utopia by yourself, I won’t go

41:22.521 --> 41:23.397
Masaaki

41:23.689 --> 41:24.732
what?

41:27.193 --> 41:28.527
I have someone I like

41:34.408 --> 41:36.118
I fell in love with her again

41:43.459 --> 41:44.627
"again"?

41:44.710 --> 41:46.795
The guy I met in San Diego

41:48.005 --> 41:49.215
I saw her again

41:51.008 --> 41:52.593
I'm attracted to her again

41:54.386 --> 41:56.096
Started to care about her again

42:07.942 --> 42:08.859
so

42:09.985 --> 42:11.987
Have you decided to get back together with her?

42:13.822 --> 42:14.657
not yet

42:15.115 --> 42:16.367
I haven't told her yet

42:17.451 --> 42:19.662
-Why?
-I'm afraid of being rejected by her again

42:23.999 --> 42:24.833
idiot

42:26.710 --> 42:28.587
The first time, I just thought I was dumped in a daze.

42:29.213 --> 42:31.298
But I've had a taste of that

42:31.882 --> 42:32.967
But have to go through it a second time?

42:35.135 --> 42:36.637
I really have no confidence

42:36.720 --> 42:39.515
Then you want to continue to have a crush on her?

42:40.266 --> 42:42.851
My feelings for her are not love yet

42:44.144 --> 42:44.979
What?

42:45.354 --> 42:48.440
I feel moved and care about her very much

42:49.316 --> 42:50.985
i do like her

42:51.986 --> 42:54.446
But I'm not sure if that's love

42:59.159 --> 43:00.744
Love is nothing special

43:01.412 --> 43:03.330
Those feelings gathered together are love

43:07.251 --> 43:09.253
I've liked you since I was a child

43:11.463 --> 43:13.048
I thought this was wrong

43:13.966 --> 43:15.092
i can't like you

43:15.718 --> 43:19.430
Convince yourself that we are just friends
and restrain your feelings for you

43:20.180 --> 43:21.557
Why didn't you tell me then?

43:21.640 --> 43:24.518
At that time, I felt that we were not the same kind of people

43:25.561 --> 43:27.521
You are like someone living in another world

43:28.188 --> 43:30.107
Someone I can't catch

43:30.691 --> 43:32.484
people i can't touch

43:34.111 --> 43:38.907
You were volunteering in Africa while I was worrying about rent.

43:40.117 --> 43:41.869
It feels like you are a different person

43:43.370 --> 43:44.246
but

43:45.372 --> 43:47.291
Now we are in the same company

43:48.208 --> 43:49.543
Meet every day

43:51.128 --> 43:52.630
So I seem to be greedy

43:55.924 --> 43:58.135
I'm no different from you

43:59.053 --> 44:00.971
we live in the same world

44:04.016 --> 44:05.184
so

44:05.559 --> 44:07.311
That's why I had that thought

44:08.729 --> 44:10.689
I think I might like you now

44:24.328 --> 44:26.121
After I said it, I felt much more relaxed

44:27.122 --> 44:28.791
Even though I'm so embarrassed

44:33.212 --> 44:34.588
Do you want tissues?

44:35.047 --> 44:36.298
Well, bring it

44:36.382 --> 44:37.299
I don't

44:38.133 --> 44:40.052
Am I someone who carries tissues with me everywhere?

44:43.931 --> 44:46.183
Isn't it nice to look at each other like this?

44:51.230 --> 44:52.064
Hello…

44:57.653 --> 44:59.655
You're right, that's great

45:06.161 --> 45:10.165
You are in a lovelorn state now, so I will let you go

45:10.249 --> 45:11.458
Do you understand?

45:12.042 --> 45:13.544
I will never forgive you next time

45:14.795 --> 45:16.797
-This station is
-You get off first

45:16.880 --> 45:19.216
Dongsan-dong Korea District Heating Company Station

45:19.299 --> 45:21.176
Why? We'll be at Utopia soon

45:22.302 --> 45:25.097
I was rejected, I have to feel sad again

45:25.180 --> 45:26.140
You get off the car first

45:30.436 --> 45:31.395
good

45:32.855 --> 45:33.981
If you feel more comfortable that way

46:51.642 --> 46:55.312
what happened again? What happened again this time?

46:55.979 --> 46:57.689
Oh, it's true

46:57.940 --> 46:59.525
Xiao Zhao confessed to me

47:00.150 --> 47:01.235
She said she likes me

47:01.944 --> 47:02.945
What?

47:03.028 --> 47:03.987
Just now during the day

47:04.655 --> 47:05.906
In the company's tea room

47:08.242 --> 47:09.576
Oh my god

47:12.287 --> 47:13.914
Wow, it really looks like her style

47:16.333 --> 47:17.501
But I rejected her

47:19.586 --> 47:21.046
I also have people I like

47:22.047 --> 47:24.591
Hey, who is the person you like?

47:24.675 --> 47:25.884
Our company's chief public relations officer

47:26.343 --> 47:27.761
What? what does that mean?

47:27.845 --> 47:30.597
Serong's chief public relations officer
is the woman in San Diego

47:32.182 --> 47:34.393
This is destiny, right?

47:37.479 --> 47:41.275
But I don’t know if I can confess like Yun Zhao

47:41.358 --> 47:43.402
Hey, you've already tried it once

47:43.485 --> 47:45.195
He was even harshly rejected

47:45.988 --> 47:48.740
You are pestering others by doing this.

47:48.824 --> 47:49.783
no…

47:50.993 --> 47:52.578
Things have changed, okay?

47:52.661 --> 47:54.454
I was too young then

47:54.538 --> 47:57.040
I feel like she lives in another world and...

48:07.634 --> 48:09.636
-You're crazy
-Hey

48:11.722 --> 48:14.266
I just said the exact same thing as Yun Zhao

48:37.956 --> 48:39.958
(Yoo Jae-min)

48:44.004 --> 48:47.841
(Yoo Jae-min)

48:50.260 --> 48:52.262
-Hello?
-You answered the phone?

48:52.346 --> 48:53.263
What's your business?

48:53.472 --> 48:55.557
Are you busy now?

48:58.644 --> 48:59.853
No, I'm not busy

49:00.145 --> 49:04.191
So can you give me a moment?

49:04.274 --> 49:05.233
Where are you?

49:16.453 --> 49:17.996
(Internal Culture Improvement Plan
Recruitment Task Force)

49:20.624 --> 49:23.627
Our three groups are going to send people to
the internal culture improvement project team

49:24.419 --> 49:25.337
Who is going?

49:28.090 --> 49:30.592
Going there shouldn’t reduce the workload, right?

49:30.676 --> 49:31.885
-Team leader-
No.

49:31.969 --> 49:34.763
Is that just business as usual
and then add this on top of that?

49:34.846 --> 49:36.056
This is how the task force works

49:45.524 --> 49:46.692
Where is Agent Park?

49:49.569 --> 49:51.071
Can contract personnel also participate?

49:54.074 --> 49:56.785
In fact, I just came to this world not long ago

49:56.868 --> 49:59.621
So I don’t know much about Se Yong’s culture yet.

49:59.705 --> 50:02.207
You should know Seyong’s culture better than anyone else, right?

50:08.797 --> 50:11.299
I would like to go if I could participate

50:11.591 --> 50:13.885
“Not in a rigid, hierarchical system

50:13.969 --> 50:16.388
An organization that concentrates power in one person

50:16.471 --> 50:19.516
Instead, create a system that empowers individuals to make decisions
and change based on the situation.

50:19.599 --> 50:23.729
An approach to an agile and responsive organization”

50:27.607 --> 50:29.067
Not bad, right?

50:29.651 --> 50:30.777
-Yeah
yeah

50:31.069 --> 50:32.571
So

50:33.405 --> 50:34.448
Who is going?

50:38.660 --> 50:42.164
Team leader, the graduation ceremony of the college student experience group will be held today.

50:42.664 --> 50:44.833
Oh my God, it's finally over.

50:45.417 --> 50:48.420
Otherwise, do we have to experience it for a lifetime?
Do you think they will never grow old?

50:53.050 --> 50:53.884
Really

51:02.893 --> 51:03.727
You are the one

51:06.146 --> 51:06.980
good

51:14.780 --> 51:15.781
Hello

51:17.449 --> 51:18.784
Is this an internal culture improvement task force?

51:19.409 --> 51:21.036
No one else has come yet

51:21.328 --> 51:22.162
right

51:27.626 --> 51:28.794
We decided by drawing lots

51:29.836 --> 51:31.922
-What?
-Human resources are determined by drawing lots.

51:32.005 --> 51:33.799
I'm so unlucky

51:33.924 --> 51:36.593
I've never won a prize

51:37.344 --> 51:39.054
I just have good luck in this kind of thing

51:39.721 --> 51:42.140
I volunteered because I wanted to participate

51:49.272 --> 51:50.857
Why haven't you come yet?

51:53.026 --> 51:55.028
I plan to work here for the rest of my life.

51:56.154 --> 51:57.405
I need this opportunity

51:58.031 --> 51:59.825
Work that distracts me and allows me to work hard

51:59.908 --> 52:03.078
But it must be very painful to see him every day.

52:04.162 --> 52:05.205
We don't meet every day

52:05.497 --> 52:08.416
As long as I don't go out of my way to see him,
we won't run into each other.

52:09.084 --> 52:11.211
Why? Don't you work together anymore?

52:11.294 --> 52:13.213
Xiaomin is temporarily transferred to a group.

52:13.296 --> 52:15.215
We have no chance to work together now

52:15.966 --> 52:17.634
This is actually better

52:18.260 --> 52:21.763
I also need time to fill my broken heart

52:23.348 --> 52:26.434
Why did you confess to him in the tea room?

52:26.518 --> 52:27.936
That is to say

52:28.019 --> 52:30.522
If I drink, I can still pretend not to remember

52:30.605 --> 52:32.232
But this time I really can't argue

52:33.733 --> 52:34.776
Damn it

52:36.027 --> 52:37.571
Hey, I'm done

52:38.113 --> 52:39.573
Xiaomin seems to have also joined the task force

52:48.957 --> 52:52.294
Alas, my mentor always shines

52:52.377 --> 52:54.045
Why did you suddenly bring this up?

52:55.714 --> 52:56.965
Yes, Minister, itinerary...

53:02.762 --> 53:04.431
Sorry, I have something urgent to deal with

53:04.514 --> 53:05.932
sorry

53:16.359 --> 53:18.570
I think he's about to hit you

53:19.905 --> 53:20.906
good

53:22.449 --> 53:23.575
Thanks

53:40.634 --> 53:41.593
correct

53:42.302 --> 53:45.055
Xiaomin said that the person he likes
is the chief public relations officer of your company

53:45.889 --> 53:47.057
Is that a very high position?

53:48.767 --> 53:52.229
Anyway, she's the woman from San Diego

54:26.221 --> 54:28.223
