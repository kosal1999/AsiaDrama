00:41.041 --> 00:43.877
The characters and events are fictitious.

00:44.419 --> 00:47.213
“Did SEYONG hire employees
for good publicity?”

00:48.214 --> 00:50.550
Why did I waste
four years of college?

00:50.633 --> 00:52.218
next life

00:52.302 --> 00:54.387
I do it just like she does.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.974
Big shots hired them.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.559
I know. This is crazy.

00:59.642 --> 01:02.395
Apparently
PR team leaders are debating this issue.

01:02.479 --> 01:03.980
We have problems because of her.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.398
-ridiculous.
-real.

01:05.482 --> 01:06.566
Professional ethics...

01:06.649 --> 01:08.860
It turns out I work for the same company!

01:09.319 --> 01:10.320
This is so embarrassing.

01:17.660 --> 01:19.913
Miss Li, do you have what I want?

01:19.996 --> 01:21.414
Yes, just for a moment.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.124
what do you need?

01:25.126 --> 01:28.129
Evaluation report of special bid candidates.

01:28.213 --> 01:29.506
for what?

01:29.756 --> 01:31.049
to confirm.

01:32.759 --> 01:35.678
Personnel-related documents
are confidential.

01:36.179 --> 01:39.724
We can't publish if the PR department asks for it .

01:39.808 --> 01:41.726
But the assessment report does not...

01:41.810 --> 01:42.977
despite this.

01:52.028 --> 01:52.862
I ask you.

01:53.238 --> 01:56.825
You know how people
reacted to our announcement.

01:56.908 --> 02:00.620
To turn this question in the right direction,
we need to provide evidence.

02:00.912 --> 02:02.705
Evaluation Report.

02:03.540 --> 02:04.958
Who ordered this?

02:05.917 --> 02:07.961
gentlemen. song? gentlemen. catty?

02:09.379 --> 02:12.090
You cannot
decide this alone.

02:13.424 --> 02:14.717
In the absence of formal requirements,

02:14.801 --> 02:17.137
We do not publish any content without Mr. Kim's approval .

02:17.762 --> 02:19.764
That's what the regulations want.

02:21.015 --> 02:24.561
I know you are friends,
but we are working, Ms. Li.

02:24.644 --> 02:25.854
sorry.

02:26.521 --> 02:27.522
but...

02:29.232 --> 02:30.441
Come on, sir. Ga.

02:30.525 --> 02:31.484
Indeed.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.833
You heard me.
I can't help you.

02:50.545 --> 02:52.547
Since when did this requirement begin?

02:52.630 --> 02:54.299
Should I stay out of it?

02:54.883 --> 02:55.967
Exactly.

02:58.761 --> 03:00.471
These reports may be

03:01.347 --> 03:03.308
Also sent to other departments.

03:03.391 --> 03:04.225
Hey.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.811
He said you should leave it.

03:08.354 --> 03:10.231
Interestingly, they are secret.

03:11.816 --> 03:12.859
-Hello.
-Hello.

03:12.942 --> 03:15.361
gentlemen. Kim,
do you still have the evaluation report?

03:15.445 --> 03:16.946
New candidate?

03:17.030 --> 03:20.783
I do not believe.
We have uploaded them.

03:21.492 --> 03:23.286
Hello. excuse me.

03:23.369 --> 03:24.621
I don't like disturbing you.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.664
But do you have an evaluation report?

03:26.748 --> 03:27.916
New candidate?

03:27.999 --> 03:29.667
We pass them on.

03:29.792 --> 03:33.755
There may be a copy here,
could you take another look?

03:34.505 --> 03:36.674
You are definitely not here.

03:37.258 --> 03:38.218
but...

03:47.894 --> 03:50.271
What are these crazy social media comments about?

03:54.484 --> 03:56.319
dislike.

03:56.402 --> 03:57.403
a shame.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.405
You insulted Seyong's name.

03:59.489 --> 04:02.158
-What a shame.
-You are happy, I am not.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.619
I hate people like you.
Always extra sausage.

04:04.702 --> 04:07.538
"What a beautiful clear sky"?
My heart is sad.

04:07.622 --> 04:08.623
excellent.

04:10.875 --> 04:13.002
Is the crap they write true?

04:13.086 --> 04:14.170
shame on you.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.047
You are ruining Shiyong's reputation.

04:16.130 --> 04:17.924
Do you have any ideas?

04:18.007 --> 04:20.510
It’s really brave
to have a public account.

04:20.593 --> 04:23.554
Data protection

04:23.638 --> 04:25.515
Switch account to private?

04:25.598 --> 04:32.397
Switch to private

04:42.615 --> 04:45.827
I said I was hungry.
Why is it taking so long?

04:51.791 --> 04:52.792
Want to eat sushi?

04:52.875 --> 04:55.503
Everything is fine with me.

04:55.837 --> 04:56.879
not like this.

04:57.463 --> 05:00.883
"I love sushi.
This is a great idea."

05:00.967 --> 05:02.051
This is how you should speak.

05:04.387 --> 05:06.639
I don't like sushi.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.435
We still eat sushi.

05:11.102 --> 05:12.520
Because I like it.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.272
Indeed.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.080
Someone objected.

05:31.622 --> 05:32.540
did you see?

05:32.623 --> 05:34.542
This really touched me.

05:37.128 --> 05:39.047
Why vote?

05:46.179 --> 05:48.723
Can you
hack the HR server?

05:49.349 --> 05:50.516
But you spin.

05:51.225 --> 05:54.395
The departments said
they had uploaded the document but did not have a copy.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.564
Hey, by the way.

05:57.482 --> 05:58.441
Is that right?

05:59.025 --> 06:00.401
she was hired because

06:01.069 --> 06:02.487
Their education level is low?

06:03.821 --> 06:05.031
I beg you.

06:06.324 --> 06:07.158
Hey.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.243
Shiyong is a legal person company.

06:09.327 --> 06:10.203
They offer...

06:11.704 --> 06:13.081
-...not everyone.
-Oh well.

06:13.164 --> 06:15.083
They won't show you reviews.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.168
This means something went wrong there.

06:17.251 --> 06:18.252
I said no.

06:20.463 --> 06:21.297
See you later.

06:22.256 --> 06:23.341
goodbye.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.138
It's not true, okay?

06:29.222 --> 06:30.890
You scare me.

06:30.973 --> 06:31.808
This is not true.

06:33.309 --> 06:38.147
so. gentlemen. Song and Ms. Ji
had a quarrel in the room

06:38.648 --> 06:40.066
About the candidates.

06:40.566 --> 06:43.653
You stand up for the underqualified,

06:43.736 --> 06:45.488
- Because it's good for the image.
-Hey!

06:47.990 --> 06:49.575
Be careful what you say. OK?

06:49.659 --> 06:51.244
She's totally experienced.

06:51.327 --> 06:53.287
She does digital PR!

06:53.371 --> 06:55.623
You just gave me a newbie.

06:55.706 --> 06:58.167
I can't
lead a team of newbies!

06:58.251 --> 07:01.003
-What do you want?
-Of course you take her there!

07:02.380 --> 07:03.381
Where were you then?

07:06.592 --> 07:07.427
What are you doing?

07:07.510 --> 07:11.681
We want to find out who in the PR world
can't shut up.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.224
Why?

07:14.976 --> 07:16.227
Ordered this sir. song?

07:16.310 --> 07:18.938
He instructed me
to find the chatterbox.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.484
I am here.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.529
I heard them arguing.

07:31.659 --> 07:32.994
Exactly.

07:33.619 --> 07:34.454
that's me.

07:36.581 --> 07:37.665
Hey sir. Meng.

07:37.748 --> 07:39.250
Indeed!

07:39.333 --> 07:41.461
Why is it taking so long?

07:45.548 --> 07:46.382
OMG.

07:51.053 --> 07:52.013
Mr. Liu.

07:54.932 --> 07:56.476
-Yes.
-What does PR stand for?

07:57.894 --> 07:59.562
Prevention and response...

07:59.645 --> 08:00.897
Hey.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.943
We decide
what we want to prevent and what we want to report.

08:07.278 --> 08:10.281
You have to plug the hole
so the dam doesn't break

08:10.364 --> 08:12.325
Don't build it yourself!

08:13.284 --> 08:14.494
Is this how you want to do PR?

08:14.577 --> 08:16.162
How will you be here,

08:16.245 --> 08:17.830
What if you don't understand anything?

08:18.372 --> 08:21.209
If you think you're in the wrong place,
cancel!

08:21.292 --> 08:22.627
Go work somewhere else.

08:22.710 --> 08:26.422
This is better for the company and better for you!

08:28.549 --> 08:30.092
-gentlemen.
-no!

08:44.815 --> 08:48.402
When dealing with a crisis, you must first
identify the cause.

08:48.486 --> 08:50.363
You taught me.

08:51.447 --> 08:52.323
and?

08:52.406 --> 08:56.077
I don't think Chatterbox
is to blame for this situation.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.871
We mishandled it from the beginning.

08:59.747 --> 09:00.915
Not taking them seriously.

09:02.041 --> 09:02.917
so you say

09:04.168 --> 09:05.545
Is it our fault?

09:09.757 --> 09:11.133
-Hey, sir. Meng.
-Indeed.

09:11.467 --> 09:13.135
Is that what he said?

09:13.886 --> 09:15.179
return...

09:15.263 --> 09:17.807
Now?
Should we ask for forgiveness?

09:17.890 --> 09:21.769
Since it's all our fault, should we give up?

09:23.521 --> 09:24.689
Do you want that?

09:24.772 --> 09:27.066
-you misunderstood.
-Then what?

09:28.776 --> 09:31.529
Let's announce
the candidate ratings.

09:35.992 --> 09:37.159
That won't work.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.288
Other people's comments
are not fair.

09:40.371 --> 09:41.706
Park Yoon-joo’s, okay.

09:41.789 --> 09:42.832
"Fair"?

09:42.915 --> 09:44.125
that's enough.

09:45.167 --> 09:46.544
The discussion is over.

09:47.753 --> 09:49.046
Once and for all.

10:10.526 --> 10:11.902
Are you coming to the stairwell?

10:29.253 --> 10:30.296
How is this going?

10:30.379 --> 10:32.506
I have a question.

10:33.507 --> 10:36.010
Is what they say true?

10:36.594 --> 10:37.803
Is the team leader having an argument?

10:43.184 --> 10:44.018
So is it?

10:45.519 --> 10:47.647
No, that's not correct.

10:48.356 --> 10:51.692
gentlemen. Ms. Song and Ms. Ji
had a little dispute.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.528
But this has nothing to do with you.

10:54.612 --> 10:55.696
What is that about?

10:57.156 --> 10:58.991
Everyone thinks it's about me.

10:59.617 --> 11:00.993
Even the PR department.

11:02.453 --> 11:05.373
But that may not be the case.
Don't worry, Yin Qiao.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.249
"perhaps"?

11:08.417 --> 11:09.669
Do you believe it too?

11:10.169 --> 11:13.297
-Am I not qualified enough?
-No.

11:14.548 --> 11:16.050
I do not believe.

11:16.342 --> 11:17.426
you are lying.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.808
You seem to think
this is possible.

11:23.891 --> 11:28.229
I'm not qualified enough
to work here.

11:28.312 --> 11:29.397
No.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.190
I do not think so.

11:31.273 --> 11:32.566
I can.

11:32.650 --> 11:33.776
That's how I feel.

11:35.903 --> 11:38.572
Even if I saw it,
why would you think differently?

11:46.080 --> 11:48.582
I hope
you deny this until the end.

11:52.378 --> 11:53.462
Yunzu.

11:53.546 --> 11:54.422
Yun Qiao...

12:29.707 --> 12:30.833
Where do you want to go?

12:36.255 --> 12:37.506
Please go to the 13th floor.

12:49.935 --> 12:50.853
wait...

13:09.789 --> 13:10.623
Hello?

13:10.706 --> 13:11.582
Good morning

13:13.000 --> 13:13.834
and.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.170
He's here.

13:17.880 --> 13:18.881
OK

13:19.507 --> 13:23.052
Manager
Meng Zhejun

13:23.135 --> 13:23.969
Jaemin.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.180
Fr. Guhui,

13:26.263 --> 13:28.182
You go to her office immediately.

13:28.265 --> 13:30.184
Due to the special bidding.

13:48.285 --> 13:49.119
HR Team Leader

13:49.203 --> 13:51.372
Why did Father Gu want to talk to him?

13:51.455 --> 13:52.748
do you know?

13:58.587 --> 14:01.924
There was no point in talking to him.
He knows nothing.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.553
We don't allow this content to be posted.

14:05.636 --> 14:06.720
That's not fair.

14:08.639 --> 14:10.474
Of course, it has to be fair.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.793
CCO Gao Yizheng

14:57.438 --> 15:01.650
can I help you?

15:08.157 --> 15:09.617
CV

15:17.458 --> 15:18.918
gentlemen. Liu Zaimin.

15:19.835 --> 15:20.669
and.

15:20.753 --> 15:24.506
When users complained about the company in online forums
,

15:24.590 --> 15:28.385
Does the public relations department have
specific procedures?

15:29.303 --> 15:32.723
There are no rules for handling posts on Blahbla.

15:32.806 --> 15:35.809
When media coverage is bad.

15:36.477 --> 15:37.978
-And then we react.
-No.

15:38.562 --> 15:39.563
That's different.

15:40.439 --> 15:43.651
I want to know how the company reacts

15:44.401 --> 15:46.904
When employees complain about us.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.657
That's my problem.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.662
The company took no action.

15:56.705 --> 15:58.332
Next point.

15:58.874 --> 16:01.585
The first announcement from HR.

16:02.378 --> 16:05.589
I want to know
how you came up with this.

16:08.884 --> 16:09.843
Mr. Liu.

16:12.846 --> 16:15.891
This is not a difficult question;

16:16.600 --> 16:17.935
or?

16:18.310 --> 16:20.312
The problem is not difficult

16:21.021 --> 16:22.690
But it's hard to answer.

16:22.773 --> 16:25.275
All you have to do is state the facts.

16:25.359 --> 16:26.568
How hard can it be?

16:27.152 --> 16:29.613
How could a simple assistant

16:29.697 --> 16:32.741
Have an honest conversation with your manager?

16:35.452 --> 16:36.829
Sorry, what?

16:36.912 --> 16:38.455
Why did you hire me?

16:38.539 --> 16:40.082
I want to hear it.

16:40.165 --> 16:41.041
from me?

16:41.125 --> 16:42.334
do not you

16:43.002 --> 16:44.253
Hire me?

16:50.968 --> 16:51.844
What am I...

16:54.847 --> 16:56.932
Why do you think...I don't...

17:03.063 --> 17:04.023
return...

17:04.106 --> 17:05.899
Listen, Ms. Park. they are...

17:08.819 --> 17:10.112
I would like to know:

17:10.946 --> 17:12.489
Is it really just for good PR?

17:14.199 --> 17:16.577
Because I better meet the requirements

17:16.660 --> 17:17.619
More than anyone else.

17:20.080 --> 17:21.457
As for candidate A...

17:22.041 --> 17:24.752
I think I know her.
You can see it in their work.

17:25.794 --> 17:28.130
Forget it, I won't show it to others.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.425
I hope
we hire a good person.

17:31.925 --> 17:33.594
I don't know, Suntae.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.971
Is this for the benefit of the company?

17:36.055 --> 17:37.431
Exactly.

17:37.514 --> 17:39.433
By the way, thank you.

18:10.422 --> 18:12.758
You were
hired because of your qualifications.

18:13.634 --> 18:16.637
You were not chosen by me

18:17.554 --> 18:20.641
But from all Seyong employees.
You are the best.

In Psalms,

Psalm 49 verse 16 says…

19:09.022 --> 19:09.898

"Don't let yourself be intimidated;

His temple is more glorious. "

19:17.239 --> 19:18.407
Do you know why?

19:19.324 --> 19:20.534
Verse 17 says:

19:22.494 --> 19:26.081
No matter what, you don't take anything with you when you die
.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.959
So smart, impressive, right?

19:29.042 --> 19:29.877

19:30.836 --> 19:33.839
Yes, it makes you think.

I hope

Be humble.

19:40.304 --> 19:41.388
and.

19:41.471 --> 19:43.557
I will work hard and humbly.

19:44.808 --> 19:48.604
I know I should do this,
but it's hard.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.732
I have to leave something to my children.

20:12.002 --> 20:14.213
Yes, see you later.

20:15.088 --> 20:15.923
goodbye.

20:22.137 --> 20:24.640
Is something bothering you?

20:26.141 --> 20:29.603
Here's the thing about candidates in special races.

20:29.686 --> 20:30.604
and.

20:30.687 --> 20:33.106
It all turned out to be pretty annoying.

20:36.026 --> 20:37.152
It's not just cosmetics.

20:37.236 --> 20:40.656
The framework is suitable for other products as well.

20:40.739 --> 20:43.283
Your event is very popular abroad.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.327
I owe you this.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.162
-Thank you for your efforts.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.872

Ms. Park.

21:11.436 --> 21:13.021
-gentlemen. SEO.

21:21.321 --> 21:22.155
here.

21:23.323 --> 21:24.241
Thanks.

21:30.330 --> 21:31.373
How are you?

21:32.499 --> 21:34.418
-Sorry, what?
-How are you?

21:37.254 --> 21:42.509
You were the first
person to ask me today if I was okay.

21:44.845 --> 21:47.806
We're not very close,
so you can tell me.

21:49.516 --> 21:53.437
Maybe talking about it will make you feel better.

21:58.400 --> 22:02.362
I'm tired of
always having to prove something

22:03.155 --> 22:05.490
When I haven't started yet.

22:07.451 --> 22:08.618
Then leave it.

22:09.870 --> 22:11.288
Why do you want to?

22:11.788 --> 22:14.082
Let them think whatever they want.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.294
don’t worry.

22:21.548 --> 22:22.758
But you can't.

22:25.385 --> 22:27.262
I even understand this.

22:27.804 --> 22:29.973
You think you have something to show them,

22:30.057 --> 22:31.683
to gain their approval.

22:32.434 --> 22:33.769
You don't feel safe.

22:34.728 --> 22:36.271
Unless you're alone.

22:37.773 --> 22:38.982
you know.

22:39.066 --> 22:40.442
I'm like this too

22:41.860 --> 22:43.570
I worry too much.

22:44.154 --> 22:45.989
I keep pushing myself

22:46.073 --> 22:48.325
And wasting my energy.

22:49.076 --> 22:52.204
It's like I'm grabbing my own hair
and pulling.

22:52.287 --> 22:54.081
I always give it my all.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.879
Heeyoung once told me

23:02.130 --> 23:05.008
I should stop
fighting myself.

23:06.176 --> 23:07.052
And I should...

23:09.513 --> 23:10.847
...Believe in yourself more.

23:15.185 --> 23:16.019
you're right.

23:16.436 --> 23:18.563
Now I feel better.

23:20.774 --> 23:21.775
Thanks.

23:25.195 --> 23:28.824
The weather is sunny today. And warm.

23:32.160 --> 23:33.370
Thank you.

23:33.453 --> 23:34.496
Clear.

23:52.722 --> 23:54.391
and? Did you tell her everything?

23:54.891 --> 23:56.226
Will Mr. Song be fired?

23:57.269 --> 23:58.687
What did Mrs. Gu say?

23:59.271 --> 24:01.398
She asked
me if I liked working here.

24:01.815 --> 24:02.691
used to be?

24:03.358 --> 24:05.444
-What?
-She asked how things were in the office.

24:05.527 --> 24:07.737
What did you say? chaotic?

24:10.240 --> 24:12.325
what's so funny?

24:12.784 --> 24:15.787
Ms. Park asked Mr. Song
why he hired her.

24:16.371 --> 24:19.416
And whether this is actually a PR stunt.

24:20.500 --> 24:21.835
I have to say,

24:21.918 --> 24:23.336
That's so bold, right?

24:23.420 --> 24:26.548
She
was apparently attacked on social media.

24:26.882 --> 24:28.091
She sets it to private.

24:30.177 --> 24:31.219
and?

24:31.303 --> 24:32.512
What did sir do? Song said?

24:32.596 --> 24:34.389
Their abilities are compelling.

24:54.784 --> 24:55.869
So it's true.

24:56.578 --> 24:58.497
You really don’t talk to each other anymore.

24:58.997 --> 25:00.874
I thought you were kidding.

25:01.917 --> 25:04.252
He supports our legal department.

25:04.336 --> 25:06.254
I had to beg him.

25:06.338 --> 25:09.049
-You know he's busy and expensive.
-real.

25:09.132 --> 25:12.344
I
understand the reputation of KA Law Firm.

25:12.802 --> 25:13.637
Can we?

25:17.724 --> 25:18.892
See you later.

25:19.476 --> 25:20.810
Eun-seok!

25:20.894 --> 25:22.437
Eunseok, wait!

25:30.070 --> 25:31.530
Is it necessary to be so hostile?

25:31.613 --> 25:33.657
Gu Yi is the new CCO?

25:35.325 --> 25:36.743
Is this necessary?

25:37.202 --> 25:38.203
Why?

25:39.287 --> 25:40.413
Yichang is very famous.

25:41.540 --> 25:45.377
You lawyers
may not know this, but...

25:46.711 --> 25:49.214
She helped with the presidential campaign.

25:51.508 --> 25:53.969
You're going to get into politics, aren't you?

25:54.052 --> 25:56.346
Maybe you'll need her help in the future

25:56.429 --> 25:58.473
So don't be so cold to her.

25:59.057 --> 26:02.769
What matters to me is ability,
not relationships.

26:04.646 --> 26:05.939
Did you see it?

26:06.314 --> 26:09.109
We would have made a great couple.

26:09.609 --> 26:11.361
But you married Yi Jing,

26:11.444 --> 26:13.613
Even if your family objects.

26:13.697 --> 26:15.156
Then the marriage ended like this...

26:18.368 --> 26:20.245
Okay, I'll stop.

26:28.753 --> 26:29.671
See you in the morning.

26:30.255 --> 26:31.172
and.

26:35.802 --> 26:38.096
The team leader meets with the general manager.

26:39.723 --> 26:41.182
hurry up. Now?

26:59.326 --> 27:01.911
What are you doing now?
I need to go to work.

27:02.495 --> 27:06.124
The decision has been made.
We just need to act accordingly.

27:06.207 --> 27:08.084
This is Mr. Kim's instruction.

27:08.793 --> 27:10.587
we should get rid of this problem

27:10.670 --> 27:12.172
If there is no solution.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.800
Why Mr. Jin Yi?

27:15.884 --> 27:18.011
Because he's going to be vice president soon...

27:18.094 --> 27:20.013
Come on, you know this.

27:20.972 --> 27:23.391
gentlemen. Kim was by his side now.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.018
What is he doing?

27:27.270 --> 27:28.146
nun...

27:29.314 --> 27:31.274
He wanted to blame Park Yoon-joo.

27:34.736 --> 27:35.737
She must go.

27:35.820 --> 27:38.698
-We'll move her somewhere else...
-Suntae!

27:38.782 --> 27:41.576
The decision has been made,
so do it.

27:41.660 --> 27:42.911
OK?

27:44.120 --> 27:45.997
If you have already decided...

27:46.665 --> 27:49.042
Do you really think this
is the best solution?

27:49.125 --> 27:50.585
Do you have a better idea?

27:50.669 --> 27:53.004
Can you think of an alternative?

27:53.672 --> 27:54.798
No rights?

27:54.881 --> 27:56.049
No rights?

27:56.675 --> 27:58.718
think about it.

27:58.802 --> 28:02.013
What you said
gave others the wrong idea

28:02.097 --> 28:03.723
It will only make everything worse!

28:03.807 --> 28:06.017
Are you saying this is all my fault?

28:07.018 --> 28:09.020
You chose Yunqiao.

28:09.104 --> 28:10.480
- as a PR stunt.
-Hey!

28:13.191 --> 28:16.611
If no one here believes me, who will?

28:16.695 --> 28:19.781
Now that the decision has been made,
why do we need to hold a meeting?

28:20.281 --> 28:21.408
Hehe, where do you want to go...

28:21.491 --> 28:24.202
If we
don't...

28:26.746 --> 28:28.164
That's incredible.

29:15.086 --> 29:16.755
what happened? How is this going?

29:16.838 --> 29:18.757
It's clean and tidy.

29:20.675 --> 29:23.178
Even in my room? I will kill you!

29:26.514 --> 29:28.308
I didn't touch anything.

29:29.976 --> 29:30.810
OK

29:32.687 --> 29:35.190
did you eat? Do you want instant noodles?

29:35.523 --> 29:36.524
Chapaguri.

29:38.318 --> 29:40.111
She knows what she wants.

29:43.198 --> 29:46.159
You have to get this.
We only have instant noodles.

29:46.242 --> 29:47.702
Let's go, grandma!

29:53.750 --> 29:54.626
"Oma"?

29:55.794 --> 29:56.628
"Oma"?

29:56.711 --> 29:58.588
I keep saying this. and?

29:58.671 --> 30:00.590
You should talk to me differently.

30:01.591 --> 30:04.260
I'm warning you:
I might kill someone.

30:08.056 --> 30:10.600
Already answered. It keeps vibrating.

30:10.683 --> 30:12.477
Jaemin

30:23.071 --> 30:24.405
Why not beef?

30:24.489 --> 30:27.450
That's all we can take.

30:29.452 --> 30:30.537
Pork belly.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.288
Isn’t pork better?

30:32.372 --> 30:33.623
So you want pork.

30:36.417 --> 30:37.418
Were you taken away?

30:40.839 --> 30:42.173
Hey, Lee Haizu.

30:42.382 --> 30:45.009
You are so rude to me, your sister
.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.553
And you were nice to him.

30:46.636 --> 30:47.679
Were you taken away?

30:47.762 --> 30:49.097
You are so rude.

30:49.180 --> 30:50.849
I don't have a girlfriend. Why?

30:51.516 --> 30:52.517
why not?

30:52.600 --> 30:54.143
Are you picky?

30:54.227 --> 30:55.895
Only date celebrities?

30:55.979 --> 30:57.647
Or are you a pervert?

30:58.690 --> 30:59.816
Neither nor.

31:00.233 --> 31:03.361
After that, go back to your room.
I'll only say it once.

31:03.444 --> 31:05.738
what about me? Do you like students?

31:07.532 --> 31:10.535
Did you just ask him out?
go out!

31:10.618 --> 31:12.787
Are you angry that you can't get him?

31:13.246 --> 31:15.415
-Hey!
-Capture! Are you embarrassed by this?

31:15.498 --> 31:17.083
-You little thing... come here!
-Why?

31:17.166 --> 31:18.626
-Stand firm!
-you are dead.

31:19.294 --> 31:20.503
-come over.
-seriously.

31:20.587 --> 31:22.714
I said come on over. Don't ignore me!

31:22.797 --> 31:24.340
Let me go, damn it!

31:24.424 --> 31:26.217
"Damn"? how dare you?

31:26.301 --> 31:29.262
-I'm your sister!
-Hey, let me go!

31:29.345 --> 31:30.430
here.

31:31.222 --> 31:32.181
Thanks.

31:36.644 --> 31:38.104
Why are you here?

31:40.148 --> 31:42.066
A sitcom about squabbling sisters?

31:44.068 --> 31:46.154
I won. That's it.

31:48.448 --> 31:50.700
That's so tiring. It feels good.

31:54.495 --> 31:55.455
Everything is fine with you.

31:58.583 --> 31:59.709
I am fine.

32:01.878 --> 32:02.962
Exactly.

32:05.423 --> 32:06.257
Let's toast.

32:06.883 --> 32:07.926
Prost.

32:18.269 --> 32:22.482
You have to sacrifice yourself for the team.

32:23.191 --> 32:25.485
Only you can smooth things over.

32:26.110 --> 32:28.237
The way you lie in bed is the way you lie.

32:28.321 --> 32:31.783
The person who created the problem
should also solve it.

32:32.700 --> 32:33.785
to be honest,

32:34.369 --> 32:38.122
None of this would have happened if you hadn't...

32:40.416 --> 32:41.417
I mean...

32:43.378 --> 32:45.463
You know what I mean, right?

32:47.423 --> 32:49.258
Do you want to transfer me to transportation?

32:49.342 --> 32:53.805
Yes, they need
accountants.

32:54.347 --> 32:57.809
And you are an accounting professional.

32:58.768 --> 33:02.146
After all, your first job is as
an accountant.

33:02.730 --> 33:05.483
it's a happy coincidence

33:05.817 --> 33:07.944
It's like it's predetermined.

33:08.444 --> 33:09.946
Wait, Ms. Park.

33:11.322 --> 33:14.993
We'll bring you back when everything calms down, okay?

33:15.576 --> 33:20.123
By the way,
the view down there is amazing.

33:20.206 --> 33:22.083
Fresh air,...

33:22.375 --> 33:24.127
Ms. Park. wait!

33:30.341 --> 33:32.719
Wait, Ms. Park. talk to me.

33:32.802 --> 33:33.803
no thanks.

33:36.806 --> 33:37.640
Fr. Yes.

33:38.933 --> 33:41.894
Was it your idea to transfer me to another transport?

33:45.481 --> 33:47.316
Is it your decision?

33:47.400 --> 33:50.528
Was it your idea to transfer me to the accounting department?

33:50.611 --> 33:53.281
The team leader holds a meeting
and decides...

33:53.364 --> 33:55.033
Don't be so stingy.

33:55.658 --> 33:58.578
Let's go back
and chat privately.

33:58.661 --> 34:01.330
gentlemen. Song,
just say it.

34:02.331 --> 34:03.207
what does that mean?

34:03.791 --> 34:05.001
I will tell her.

34:05.626 --> 34:06.586
Ms. Park.

34:06.669 --> 34:10.339
We could have
just informed you and that was the end of it.

34:10.423 --> 34:12.383
But we don't want that, and...

34:12.467 --> 34:14.510
I never agreed with this!

34:14.594 --> 34:15.970
Are you trying to snub me?

34:16.054 --> 34:17.680
And take my team members away?

34:17.764 --> 34:19.015
That's not the case.

34:19.098 --> 34:20.016
Fr. righteous!

34:20.475 --> 34:21.768
she...

34:22.602 --> 34:23.936
And you?

34:30.985 --> 34:33.529
listen. Shall we talk privately?

34:33.613 --> 34:34.864
follow me. OK?

34:35.740 --> 34:36.616
Come.

34:37.784 --> 34:39.243
Keep talking here.

34:42.538 --> 34:43.748
What are you doing?

34:43.831 --> 34:46.042
Hey! Step aside!

34:47.668 --> 34:48.503
Come.

34:48.628 --> 34:50.296
-I ask you.
-Hey!

34:50.379 --> 34:53.424
I need to talk to Park Yun-jo,
so stay out of the way.

34:54.050 --> 34:55.718
The company has decided!

34:55.802 --> 34:58.096
-boss!
-shut your mouth!

34:58.596 --> 35:00.098
What's going on here?

35:01.766 --> 35:02.725
Fr. Sticky stuff.

35:19.992 --> 35:21.410
in public relations department

35:22.870 --> 35:23.955
There is confusion.

35:28.793 --> 35:29.627
Fr. Sticky stuff.

35:30.378 --> 35:34.924
I want all PR people
gathered in the main conference room.

35:35.716 --> 35:36.592
nature.

35:42.723 --> 35:44.934
Looking forward to your arrival

35:45.601 --> 35:48.020
Except for those with external appointments.

35:48.104 --> 35:49.313
do you understand?

35:49.397 --> 35:50.857
Indeed.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.543
So where is she?

36:15.089 --> 36:18.426
I never agreed to
transfer Ms. Park.

36:18.968 --> 36:21.220
gentlemen. Kim approved.

36:21.304 --> 36:22.513
Where is Ms. Gu?

36:25.308 --> 36:26.893
I have no idea.

36:28.102 --> 36:31.105
Looks like mr. Kim
will take care of it.

36:33.316 --> 36:34.942
gentlemen. King gave him the green light.

36:35.651 --> 36:37.361
When did this happen?

36:38.446 --> 36:39.822
Last night, in the bar.

37:09.393 --> 37:10.394
sit down.

37:21.906 --> 37:27.495
I am very sorry to meet you all in this way.

37:27.578 --> 37:29.163
I'm sure you feel the same way.

37:30.289 --> 37:34.001
I want to know
how the PR department handled this crisis

37:34.085 --> 37:37.046
And whether your strategy is reasonable.

37:37.129 --> 37:39.131
If something like this happens again

37:39.715 --> 37:41.676
Each of you should

37:41.759 --> 37:44.929
Not only do managers
know what to do,

37:45.012 --> 37:47.640
Get active.

37:48.140 --> 37:50.476
That's why I'm calling this meeting.

37:51.727 --> 37:54.981
The latest incident started with
a post on Blahbla.

37:56.816 --> 37:58.567
You didn't do it,

37:58.651 --> 38:01.320
Debunking rumors from anonymous employees.

38:02.154 --> 38:05.157
And you're
actually making it worse.

38:05.241 --> 38:07.326
"You chose a new one."

38:07.410 --> 38:10.413
They said there was no problem with the special tender;

38:10.496 --> 38:13.332
And none of the accusations
are true.

38:13.416 --> 38:16.627
Such countermeasures
are doomed to fail.

38:16.711 --> 38:17.920
Because even

38:18.004 --> 38:20.506
PR department itself

38:21.090 --> 38:23.259
Believe this.

38:28.556 --> 38:29.890
-Hour. Song Shuntai.
-Jia?

38:31.767 --> 38:33.019
Indeed.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.772
I want you to tell me honestly

38:36.856 --> 38:38.983
How is the special tender going?

38:39.775 --> 38:40.693
return...

38:44.238 --> 38:45.239
OK

38:46.949 --> 38:48.617
All you have to do is state the facts.

38:49.201 --> 38:51.704
These are
candidate evaluation reports.

38:53.622 --> 38:55.708
Then the conversation is probably over.

38:56.459 --> 38:59.337
If the assistant is not open
to talk to the manager,

39:00.963 --> 39:02.423
Then you can go.

39:12.641 --> 39:14.894
I didn't know
you worked in PR.

39:18.731 --> 39:20.024
Are you OK?

39:23.444 --> 39:24.487
Intestine.

39:26.197 --> 39:27.156
That's very good.

39:29.367 --> 39:30.284
goodbye.

39:34.580 --> 39:35.581
Fr. Sticky stuff.

39:38.042 --> 39:39.752
View the report.

39:40.753 --> 39:44.173
Candidates should be evaluated anonymously .

39:44.256 --> 39:47.676
If this is not true,
it will appear on the appraisal report.

39:50.096 --> 39:50.930
real.

39:53.057 --> 39:56.936
They hired two
new employees in sales and public relations.

39:58.187 --> 40:00.731
The team leader
selects a candidate.

40:07.488 --> 40:10.950
So the team leader made
the final decision. Why?

40:11.033 --> 40:12.410
Is there a reason for this?

40:12.493 --> 40:13.619
nun...

40:13.953 --> 40:16.038
There are two candidates

40:16.122 --> 40:19.750
Has the highest ratings.
It's a draw.

40:19.834 --> 40:24.713
These two people are Ms. Park Yoon-joo
and another contestant. correct?

40:25.297 --> 40:26.298
Well, that's right.

40:26.382 --> 40:28.759
Why did you choose Ms. Park
instead of others?

40:31.137 --> 40:34.598
Each team leader selects one candidate

40:34.682 --> 40:36.559
It’s up to you to decide,

40:36.642 --> 40:40.896
Eventually
Ms. Park was hired.

40:42.982 --> 40:44.525
Is the process anonymous?

40:44.608 --> 40:48.112
Yes. nature. This comment is anonymous.

40:49.029 --> 40:51.031
Park Yoon Joo
Online University

40:51.115 --> 40:53.159
Jeon Ye-jin
Korea University

41:03.544 --> 41:06.881
Application for cooperation
(inter-departmental cooperation)

41:10.509 --> 41:15.931
PR Team 2, Captain Song Suntae
Candidate A

41:16.599 --> 41:17.683
Fr. Chi Enjing.

41:19.518 --> 41:23.772
-Yes.
-Why choose Ms. Park Yoon-joo?

41:35.993 --> 41:37.870
Because she is that person

41:37.953 --> 41:41.415
An event plan was developed for our client Celltics.

41:42.416 --> 41:45.544
Yes, that was
an important factor in my decision.

41:46.253 --> 41:49.173
So you say,

41:49.715 --> 41:53.719
Ms. Park is
one of the two candidates,

41:53.802 --> 41:55.346
Has the highest ratings,

41:55.429 --> 41:57.848
and choose one,

41:58.307 --> 42:01.352
The team leader intervened.
But the process is anonymous.

42:01.435 --> 42:05.439
This is why there is no problem with Ms. Park’s employment.

42:05.523 --> 42:06.607
Well, that's right.

42:18.327 --> 42:22.706
However, a problem remains.

42:23.207 --> 42:25.876
The way you break your tie.

42:26.919 --> 42:30.047
In the event of a tie,
you must notify the employee

42:30.130 --> 42:33.300
Allow team leaders
to select candidates.

42:33.384 --> 42:37.012
You didn't do that,
it's a matter of procedure.

42:38.305 --> 42:39.223
And one more thing.

42:40.224 --> 42:41.976
The person you care about most

42:42.059 --> 42:44.103
Suffering from failed counter-strategies,

42:44.186 --> 42:45.771
It’s Ms. Park Yoon-joo.

42:46.438 --> 42:47.982
The company owes her

42:48.524 --> 42:49.650
Apologize.

42:55.155 --> 42:56.699
thank you for your time.

42:57.741 --> 42:59.118
that's all.

43:44.038 --> 43:45.289
Indeed.

43:46.165 --> 43:47.541
You can go in now.

43:47.625 --> 43:48.584
Thanks.

43:57.593 --> 43:58.510
Fr. Park Yoon Joo?

43:59.386 --> 44:00.512
Indeed.

44:05.768 --> 44:07.978
I'm sorry
you have to go through this.

44:10.522 --> 44:11.940
No, not bad.

44:12.650 --> 44:14.151
They are in good spirits. OK

44:14.234 --> 44:17.404
It's an honor, Ms. Gu.

44:17.488 --> 44:20.449
I can finally introduce myself properly.

44:20.532 --> 44:21.533
and.

44:30.334 --> 44:31.168
excuse me!

44:32.586 --> 44:34.129
You don't have to scream.

44:34.213 --> 44:35.214
sit down.

44:36.507 --> 44:37.383
OK

44:46.517 --> 44:48.310
Are you adapting well?

44:48.394 --> 44:50.354
Of course it is difficult

44:51.021 --> 44:53.857
But digital communication
seems to be your strong suit.

44:53.941 --> 44:57.861
In my job at the agency,
I am responsible for digital marketing.

44:57.945 --> 45:00.239
-What about social media marketing?
-Yes.

45:00.322 --> 45:01.407
understand.

45:04.284 --> 45:06.412
Let's have a drink. what do you want?

45:06.745 --> 45:09.248
I will accept anything you give me.

45:09.832 --> 45:10.958
Maybe coffee?

45:11.041 --> 45:11.917
willing.

45:12.710 --> 45:13.752
for.

45:32.396 --> 45:34.064
What's the matter with you, sir? Long?

45:36.734 --> 45:38.736
Do you think this is okay?

45:38.819 --> 45:40.237
Because I praised you?

45:42.156 --> 45:43.407
Do you think this is interesting?

45:44.700 --> 45:45.534
Hey.

45:45.951 --> 45:50.706
How much more courage do I have to endure?

45:52.833 --> 45:53.667
reply.

45:57.296 --> 45:58.505
"sorry."

45:59.548 --> 46:03.218
Now you should say:
"I'm sorry."

46:05.804 --> 46:06.972
Ryu Jae Min, you...

46:12.352 --> 46:13.562
Don't you like this?

46:14.396 --> 46:16.315
How your team leaders do things.

46:16.398 --> 46:17.691
But the problem is,

46:18.108 --> 46:21.111
These issues can
be resolved over time.

46:21.195 --> 46:24.114
Because we won't
always be your team leader.

46:24.198 --> 46:26.867
But
there is something wrong with the system itself.

46:26.950 --> 46:28.035
It's something different.

46:29.453 --> 46:30.662
Do you not like it,

46:31.830 --> 46:33.290
It's time for you to go.

46:34.875 --> 46:37.461
Seyong's public relations department has always
worked like this,

46:37.544 --> 46:39.254
This won't change.

46:39.338 --> 46:41.799
Neither does the entire company.

46:42.633 --> 46:46.637
You just have to accept it
and live with it. Why?

46:46.720 --> 46:48.514
Because you have to make money.

46:48.972 --> 46:51.850
You need money.
For leisure, for family,

46:51.934 --> 46:53.352
For pensions.

46:53.727 --> 46:55.729
There are also hospital bills!

46:55.813 --> 46:56.647
I ask you.

46:56.730 --> 46:57.898
But that's it.

46:58.398 --> 46:59.399
the last time.

47:03.737 --> 47:04.613
Mr. Liu.

47:08.325 --> 47:10.035
Don't complain.

47:10.744 --> 47:12.246
Do not ask.

47:12.830 --> 47:14.706
If you can't do it, leave.

47:15.666 --> 47:17.209
Go work somewhere else.

47:17.835 --> 47:19.002
That is...

47:20.963 --> 47:22.422
...my advice to you

47:23.423 --> 47:25.342
As a supervisor.

47:35.435 --> 47:36.979
Now say, “Thank you.”

47:47.239 --> 47:48.657
A hopeless case.

48:37.080 --> 48:38.040
Ms. Park.

48:39.291 --> 48:40.125
and?

48:42.586 --> 48:43.754
This is your project.

48:49.217 --> 48:51.428
I was with you from the beginning

48:51.511 --> 48:54.681
But you have a responsibility.

48:54.765 --> 48:56.183
Because this is your suggestion.

48:57.517 --> 48:58.352
OK

48:58.435 --> 49:01.396
This is not the end.
This is just the beginning.

49:04.691 --> 49:07.319
The beginning of deprivation.
The beginning of hell.

49:08.528 --> 49:09.363
Indeed.

49:26.338 --> 49:29.383
The new one is my supervisor.
Who would have thought?

49:30.550 --> 49:31.885
used to be?

49:32.469 --> 49:34.888
What do you write about your “PR friends”?

49:34.972 --> 49:36.932
This may cause problems for me.

49:37.724 --> 49:39.267
But no one knows.

49:39.851 --> 49:40.978
I do, okay?

49:41.895 --> 49:43.981
He yelled that I was not doing a good job.

49:44.064 --> 49:46.233
I know. That's just...

49:50.445 --> 49:51.613
-Zhejun?
-and.

49:52.447 --> 49:53.657
Why did you get into PR?

49:54.658 --> 49:55.492
what do you think?

49:55.575 --> 49:56.660
Is the job good?

49:56.743 --> 49:58.578
What the hell are you talking about?

49:58.662 --> 50:00.288
It doesn't matter if he's good or not.

50:00.372 --> 50:01.373
Just do it.

50:02.040 --> 50:03.125
In order to make money.

50:04.543 --> 50:06.336
we all have to be in some way

50:07.004 --> 50:08.171
Stay afloat.

50:08.255 --> 50:09.631
Or maybe not?

50:12.217 --> 50:13.927
You sound like Mr. song.

50:14.011 --> 50:15.679
Damn, this is the worst.

50:17.973 --> 50:18.890
How is this going?

50:20.392 --> 50:22.477
What bothers you so much?

50:26.440 --> 50:27.774
so terrible.

50:28.859 --> 50:31.737
Solutions found by our team leaders

50:31.820 --> 50:33.613
Is it to impress her?

50:34.656 --> 50:35.615
So embarrassing.

50:35.699 --> 50:37.868
you're right. That's really bad.

50:39.119 --> 50:43.623
But sir. Song said that's what happened.
In corporate and PR sectors.

50:44.499 --> 50:46.543
-If it doesn't work I should leave.
-Yes?

50:46.626 --> 50:48.211
Is that what he told you?

50:49.087 --> 50:50.714
This will make you feel uncomfortable.

50:57.512 --> 50:58.346
But Jimin...

50:58.889 --> 50:59.890
You are so different.

51:00.891 --> 51:01.767
what do you think?

51:01.850 --> 51:04.644
You take your job more seriously.

51:07.564 --> 51:09.399
I used to be like this too.

51:10.442 --> 51:12.027
I thought work and career

51:13.320 --> 51:14.696
means everything.

51:16.782 --> 51:19.076
-No, you don't think so.
-how do you know?

51:20.285 --> 51:21.203
It's the same for me.

51:25.707 --> 51:26.541
No.

51:26.625 --> 51:28.168
Is this how you want to be promoted?

51:28.251 --> 51:29.711
No. Don't worry.

51:29.795 --> 51:31.379
-Hey!
- Team leader Maeng.

51:32.089 --> 51:33.256
taxi!

51:34.883 --> 51:36.343
stop!

51:38.845 --> 51:40.138
-jump in.
-where are you going?

51:40.222 --> 51:41.556
You must go home.

51:42.015 --> 51:43.016
-Home?
-Yes.

51:43.100 --> 51:44.434
Watch your head.

51:45.644 --> 51:46.645
Go to Fangbei Cave!

51:47.687 --> 51:48.730
Los.

51:49.314 --> 51:50.148
Go home.

51:58.782 --> 52:02.702
former lady

52:05.455 --> 52:06.289
Hello?

52:07.499 --> 52:10.377
No, I didn't drink.

52:11.545 --> 52:12.379
Really?

52:12.921 --> 52:14.256
Should I go there?

53:47.140 --> 53:48.058
This is me.

53:51.436 --> 53:52.938
can we talk?

54:01.154 --> 54:02.614
Yes of course.

54:05.033 --> 54:05.951
listen.

54:09.913 --> 54:11.456
Can I come to you?

54:14.084 --> 54:15.377
It sounds like you're drunk.

54:19.256 --> 54:20.507
I'm awake again

54:30.725 --> 54:31.851
Can I come over?

54:36.064 --> 54:36.940
for.

55:25.488 --> 55:27.490
