00:37.620 --> 00:41.041
(competition in life)

00:41.124 --> 00:43.918
(The characters, events, groups, organizations
and backgrounds of this drama are purely fictitious. We hereby inform you that)

00:48.465 --> 00:52.093
It is expected that there will be about 50 people and
the server will not be overloaded, right?

00:52.177 --> 00:54.012
50 people is nothing at all

00:54.095 --> 00:55.847
- Really?
- right

00:55.930 --> 00:57.599
If the opportunity is lost, something big will happen.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.185
It won't be a problem, right

01:00.560 --> 01:02.062
- So far
- Yes

01:02.145 --> 01:03.229
These look fine

01:05.231 --> 01:06.107
Dating?

01:06.608 --> 01:09.235
Yeah, he asked her if she wanted to go on a date with him

01:10.195 --> 01:12.739
I think this is what is called American style

01:13.740 --> 01:14.657
Right?

01:15.950 --> 01:19.287
"Do you want to date me?", right?

01:24.167 --> 01:25.293
Then what?

01:25.585 --> 01:27.170
How would Yun Zhao answer?

01:28.421 --> 01:30.965
I don't know, I didn't hear her answer

01:46.940 --> 01:49.150
Do you have something to say to me? Team Leader Liu

01:51.444 --> 01:54.531
- What?
- You've been staring at me since just now

01:57.951 --> 01:58.827
me?

02:00.078 --> 02:03.832
No, I wasn't looking at you, I wasn't staring at her

02:03.915 --> 02:06.459
I didn't look at her, how could I stare...

02:07.919 --> 02:09.587
Nevermind

02:09.671 --> 02:12.549
I thought you were interested in me

02:12.632 --> 02:13.550
Interested…

02:14.259 --> 02:17.011
you said I? I'm not crazy...

02:17.095 --> 02:19.389
No, who is interested in you?

02:19.722 --> 02:20.682
Absolutely not

02:21.558 --> 02:23.101
I was joking

02:23.518 --> 02:25.478
Because everyone seems to be too nervous

02:25.562 --> 02:27.272
I just want to make you laugh

02:27.397 --> 02:30.233
Why are you so serious?

02:30.316 --> 02:31.276
It makes me feel a little uncomfortable

02:33.403 --> 02:36.614
I mean, it’s too much.
What’s wrong with Agent Park?

02:36.698 --> 02:39.659
Team Leader Liu’s eyes were originally on the top of his head.

02:40.577 --> 02:43.913
Agent Park, ignore him.
There are many men better than him in the world.

02:45.915 --> 02:47.333
Okay, start in five minutes

02:59.387 --> 03:00.722
Countdown to five seconds

03:16.696 --> 03:17.697
(Producer Shixiang, Shiyong, I want to know...)

03:17.780 --> 03:18.740
(Sexiang Planning I, Shixiang Planning
II Project Team)

03:38.676 --> 03:40.845
(Don’t waste your efforts, four years of experience)

03:42.555 --> 03:45.475
"Don't waste your efforts", welcome to you

03:47.644 --> 03:49.062
Can you hear me?

03:49.479 --> 03:50.563
Yes, you can hear it

03:50.980 --> 03:53.816
This meeting is to discuss
matters related to Se Yong, right?

03:53.900 --> 03:55.276
Yes, that's right

03:56.027 --> 03:57.153
(Employee of Serong, with three years of experience.
The resignation letter in my arms, with five years of experience)

03:57.820 --> 03:59.572
Yes, can you hear me?

03:59.656 --> 04:01.908
Hello? There is sound now

04:03.159 --> 04:04.535
- hello-
hello

04:04.619 --> 04:05.495
Hello everyone

04:05.578 --> 04:07.330
- This one only hears sounds, right?
- I think it is

04:07.413 --> 04:09.332
- Yeah, that's right
- because you can't show your face.

04:09.415 --> 04:10.875
Is it okay to express dissatisfaction directly?

04:10.959 --> 04:13.253
- Please mute everyone
- We are going to discuss Se Yong’s affairs today, right?

04:13.336 --> 04:14.254
- Right? Okay
- That's it

04:14.337 --> 04:15.588
- No need to show your face
- Is there no one to chair the meeting?

04:15.672 --> 04:16.631
If you show your face...

04:17.382 --> 04:18.800
Dear Shiyong employees

04:18.967 --> 04:23.513
Because if multiple people are talking at the same time,
the content will not be heard clearly.

04:23.596 --> 04:28.017
Please write your nickname in the dialog box
and we will let you speak in order.

04:28.643 --> 04:29.477
(Don’t waste your efforts, four years of experience)

04:30.979 --> 04:32.313
(unmute request)

04:33.231 --> 04:34.107
OK, cleared

04:36.150 --> 04:37.402
Can I speak now?

04:38.861 --> 04:40.071
As far as I'm concerned

04:40.363 --> 04:43.032
Serong’s evaluation mechanism is the biggest problem

04:43.908 --> 04:46.703
Let the team leader evaluate all team members unilaterally

04:47.078 --> 04:48.788
But the evaluation criteria are not transparent enough

04:49.372 --> 04:50.665
(The resignation letter in my arms has five years of experience.
I love Shirong and has two years of experience.)

04:50.748 --> 04:51.582
(Everyone go away, seven years of experience)

04:52.375 --> 04:55.044
As long as the person is on the promotion list,
the team leader will definitely give S

04:55.128 --> 04:56.921
The remaining people will divide A, B and C equally.

04:57.005 --> 05:00.550
But there are seniors in each group
, so the junior with the least qualifications must get a C

05:00.717 --> 05:03.344
In this case, what is the significance of the evaluation system?

05:03.428 --> 05:05.430
Is it necessary to use relative evaluation?

05:05.513 --> 05:09.142
Yes, please speak next.
"Everyone go away, seven years of experience."

05:14.689 --> 05:16.274
I don't mind showing my face

05:16.899 --> 05:17.900
is that OK?

05:17.984 --> 05:18.818
(It’s so strong, she actually turned on the camera?)

05:18.901 --> 05:19.861
(amazing, oh my god)

05:19.944 --> 05:23.114
After I gave birth to my child and returned to work after taking maternity leave
, I found out that I had been transferred to another team.

05:23.698 --> 05:25.616
Still a dispensable group

05:26.200 --> 05:29.370
All the job experience I have accumulated in the past
has become useless

05:29.454 --> 05:31.998
Doesn't this mean you want me to submit my resignation?

05:32.081 --> 05:33.041
(Super handsome! Killed with one hit, like)

05:33.124 --> 05:35.752
"Everyone go away, seven years of experience"
Thank you for your opinion

05:36.002 --> 05:38.004
The next person is "Hello, three years of experience."

05:38.087 --> 05:39.505
- It's over 50 now.
- Really?

05:39.630 --> 05:40.548
Oh, that's ok

05:40.631 --> 05:42.884
- Isn’t our goal 100?
- I am the junior who got C

05:43.134 --> 05:44.510
-Honestly-
Yeah, dream goal.

05:44.594 --> 05:45.845
The team leaders are really not doing anything.

05:45.928 --> 05:47.472
How come everyone is willing to participate when the weather is so nice ?

05:47.555 --> 05:50.058
They only know how to chat and do online shopping,
but we do all the work

05:50.141 --> 05:51.642
- So unfair
- The dialog box is now blocked.

05:51.726 --> 05:52.810
How to do this?

05:54.145 --> 05:57.648
Okay, the next one is
"No matter what, I will still be Shirong, with ten years of experience."

05:57.732 --> 05:58.733
(At least Shirong has ten years of experience...)

05:58.816 --> 06:00.485
Microphone test…

06:01.944 --> 06:05.615
At least the annual salary given by Shi Rong should be considered high, right?

06:05.865 --> 06:07.533
There are actually many advantages

06:07.617 --> 06:08.868
Everyone said it too much

06:09.494 --> 06:12.330
Aren’t the systems of every company similar?

06:12.789 --> 06:13.831
At least Se Yong

06:13.915 --> 06:17.293
Not a company that fires employees casually

06:17.794 --> 06:18.836
Say more

06:21.464 --> 06:22.298
What's wrong?

06:23.424 --> 06:24.258
(Is he a senior executive spy?
His voice sounds familiar)

06:24.342 --> 06:25.218
(What nonsense is that person talking about?)

06:25.301 --> 06:26.969
What nonsense? I'm talking human language

06:27.053 --> 06:28.179
(He must be getting money, what are you doing?)

06:28.262 --> 06:29.097
(I support him, he is amazing)

06:29.180 --> 06:30.973
(I seem to know who he is!
Section Chief Meng Zhejun of the Public Relations Group 2)

06:32.517 --> 06:33.518
Hello!

06:33.935 --> 06:34.977
- Hey, how could you...
- Oh my God

06:36.229 --> 06:37.980
Got kicked out, you brat.

06:38.314 --> 06:40.233
It would be more suspicious to quit like that

06:40.316 --> 06:41.401
You should pretend nothing is wrong and carry on...

06:42.276 --> 06:43.403
Damn it

06:46.030 --> 06:48.616
Also, doing gymnastics is really outrageous.

06:48.866 --> 06:51.619
To be honest, everyone trains themselves these days

06:52.578 --> 06:55.081
There is really no need to do gymnastics in the company

06:55.665 --> 06:58.709
Okay, next one is
"Let me go home, two years seniority"

06:58.793 --> 07:01.129
Although I knew it before I joined the company

07:01.212 --> 07:03.172
Large companies often have department dinners

07:03.923 --> 07:05.591
But it’s too frequent, right?

07:06.592 --> 07:07.844
Please ask your company to reduce the number of dinner parties

07:07.927 --> 07:09.846
Give us some time for self-development

07:10.388 --> 07:14.350
Only by obtaining high-level diplomas and certificates
can you have the chance to be promoted, right?

07:17.061 --> 07:18.479
Everyone is changing their nicknames

07:22.316 --> 07:23.943
They changed their nickname to what they wanted to say

07:24.026 --> 07:25.736
Please guarantee two years of childcare leave without pay

07:26.487 --> 07:27.822
Just have dinner together once every three months.

07:27.905 --> 07:29.782
Increase bonuses, pay benefits in cash

07:29.866 --> 07:31.617
Interview with the team leader or project leader once a quarter

07:31.701 --> 07:33.035
Flexible work system, self-disciplined attendance system

07:33.119 --> 07:35.079
- As well as shortening working hours
- I hope employees’ families will also have exclusive benefits

07:35.163 --> 07:37.123
- Please provide self-development project subsidies
- Please provide children's tuition subsidies

07:37.206 --> 07:39.167
I hope the company can set up another girls’ lounge

07:39.750 --> 07:42.879
Okay, we have listened carefully to everyone’s opinions.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.672
So the next one is...

07:44.755 --> 07:45.631
300 people

07:46.215 --> 07:47.216
What?

07:56.017 --> 07:56.934
What's wrong?

07:57.018 --> 07:57.935
What happened?

07:58.019 --> 08:00.688
Hey, what's going on?

08:00.771 --> 08:01.606
Shouldn't the machine crash?

08:01.689 --> 08:02.815
right

08:03.483 --> 08:06.694
The server cannot handle
the traffic of 300 people online at the same time

08:07.028 --> 08:08.362
Didn't you say about 50 people?

08:08.446 --> 08:10.740
It's only less than 20 minutes since it started.

08:10.823 --> 08:12.700
I know too, okay?

08:12.783 --> 08:15.745
- Hey, think of a solution.
- Give me some time, wait a minute.

08:17.580 --> 08:18.706
It seems that when…

08:19.332 --> 08:20.666
Looks like it crashed

08:21.042 --> 08:22.543
No chance to sing anymore

08:22.627 --> 08:24.378
(The host has ended this meeting)

08:25.463 --> 08:27.215
(The host has ended this meeting)

08:27.798 --> 08:29.050
This is actually better

08:29.550 --> 08:33.012
This is not a protest rally.
What on earth is it doing? Why do you do such a thing?

08:34.013 --> 08:35.806
That person just now was the deputy head of the customer service team, right?

08:35.890 --> 08:36.933
right

08:37.016 --> 08:38.392
There is another person showing his face

08:40.603 --> 08:43.940
Do they think the company is
their exclusive welfare wishing well?

08:44.482 --> 08:46.817
If they are dissatisfied, they leave, and there is no one to stop them.

08:46.901 --> 08:49.570
- If you're unhappy, you can leave.
- No, I won't leave my job.

08:54.325 --> 08:56.702
Oh, what a pity

08:57.495 --> 08:58.579
It's over too soon

08:59.622 --> 09:01.123
(The host has ended this meeting)

09:06.546 --> 09:08.256
Just when I wanted to do something, it ended

09:10.132 --> 09:12.176
It seems that there are still many people ready to come in now

09:12.260 --> 09:13.719
Everyone is asking why they can’t get in

09:15.555 --> 09:17.515
a complete failure

09:19.058 --> 09:20.476
Is it really beyond repair?

09:20.560 --> 09:21.852
Yes, no way

09:22.687 --> 09:24.188
You have no plans to reopen, right?

09:24.272 --> 09:27.149
According to today's situation, it seems that
our company's servers cannot bear it.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.985
Is there nothing we can do about it in the future?

09:29.068 --> 09:30.069
honestly…

09:30.778 --> 09:31.779
There is really no way

09:39.245 --> 09:42.623
At least the fact that the number of attendees was unexpectedly large
is very encouraging.

09:43.207 --> 09:44.875
Let's not get too depressed

09:44.959 --> 09:48.337
We didn’t expect so many people to participate
, so it’s our fault that we couldn’t respond well.

09:49.130 --> 09:51.716
To be honest, the pre-confirmation of the server
is indeed too sloppy.

09:51.799 --> 09:54.176
It must give people an unprofessional feeling.

09:54.927 --> 09:57.972
I finally planned everything
but failed to get off to a successful start.

09:58.639 --> 10:01.642
If I had known this, maybe it would have been better not to do it.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.561
Don't be so pessimistic

10:04.145 --> 10:05.479
because that's the case

10:06.439 --> 10:08.649
Everyone has worked hard today

10:10.610 --> 10:12.028
Are you leaving?

10:12.695 --> 10:14.030
Let's go have a drink together

10:14.113 --> 10:16.240
I stopped drinking for a while

10:16.324 --> 10:17.158
Why?

10:18.993 --> 10:20.745
You shouldn't really feel uncomfortable somewhere...

10:24.373 --> 10:26.125
I already have an appointment

10:26.208 --> 10:28.252
You should make an appointment in advance to drink.

10:28.544 --> 10:30.504
It's a happy Saturday after all

10:35.051 --> 10:37.428
At the same time, does this require a review report?

10:37.845 --> 10:39.513
Just help me analyze the reasons.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.307
It's not your fault, so what kind of review report should you write?

10:41.390 --> 10:42.600
Analyze the reasons?

10:43.267 --> 10:45.227
“Seyong’s computer system is too old”

10:45.311 --> 10:46.354
One line will solve it

11:01.327 --> 11:02.328
Do you have an appointment?

11:04.622 --> 11:05.623
Is it a date?

11:08.918 --> 11:10.461
Let’s go to the Han River

11:10.544 --> 11:12.463
Ask Xiaoen to remember to bring a picnic mat

11:13.422 --> 11:14.298
no problem

11:30.564 --> 11:32.274
- nice shot!
- nice shot!

11:32.358 --> 11:33.734
very good

11:42.827 --> 11:44.161
Speaking of Zheng Shouhuan

11:44.370 --> 11:48.249
I heard he actually jumped over you

11:48.332 --> 11:50.835
Go directly to the vice president

11:52.670 --> 11:53.921
I'm talking about Serdix

11:55.256 --> 11:57.842
The reason why you made that decision before

11:58.426 --> 12:00.428
Isn't it because you trust Director Zheng?

12:00.511 --> 12:03.764
But he acted like he had done nothing wrong

12:03.889 --> 12:06.976
Arrive at the vice president with the solution

12:07.476 --> 12:10.855
That plan was still the opinion put forward by Director Goo.

12:12.356 --> 12:15.985
It was you who pushed him to take the position of head of the Strategy Headquarters all along.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.612
That's so ungrateful of him.

12:18.696 --> 12:20.489
Even I feel angry

12:21.073 --> 12:24.952
He is a few years younger than me, but he is always extremely rude to me

12:25.911 --> 12:28.581
That brat thinks he's the smartest

12:28.664 --> 12:30.374
That's right, that's right

12:31.709 --> 12:33.335
What if that kind of guy becomes the head of the headquarters?

12:33.419 --> 12:37.715
He will attribute his excellence to himself
and then be like a wild horse out of control.

12:42.011 --> 12:43.220
so

12:44.054 --> 12:46.390
Do you want to sit in that seat too?

12:47.224 --> 12:48.142
What?

12:49.393 --> 12:50.269
no

12:51.145 --> 12:52.354
How dare I...

12:53.272 --> 12:54.774
God, how dare I...

12:57.109 --> 12:59.695
Very good, then just wait and see what happens.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.072
Okay, no problem, of course

13:03.741 --> 13:04.658
Get out of the way

13:05.075 --> 13:06.076
Yes, okay

13:07.828 --> 13:11.165
I also wish you good luck this time.

13:14.585 --> 13:17.087
Okay, be careful on the road, bye

13:18.589 --> 13:19.715
Xiao En said she was almost there

13:19.799 --> 13:20.883
OK, take it

13:21.675 --> 13:22.843
Thanks

13:24.762 --> 13:25.805
cheers

13:33.354 --> 13:34.271
- Awesome
- It feels so good

13:36.565 --> 13:37.817
Hey, do you know?

13:38.400 --> 13:40.820
London and Paris also have rivers running through their cities.

13:40.903 --> 13:43.405
But the width is less than 300 meters

13:44.490 --> 13:45.449
Looking back at the Han River

13:46.575 --> 13:47.910
Nearly 1 km wide

13:48.619 --> 13:51.705
It’s really rare to see a city like this with a big river.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.293
Is that a good thing?

13:56.877 --> 13:57.711
What?

13:57.795 --> 13:59.463
So do you think that's a good thing or a bad thing?

14:00.840 --> 14:01.715
Of course that's good

14:04.009 --> 14:06.262
I think Xiaotiao River is better

14:07.012 --> 14:09.098
Feeling both elegant and charming

14:15.688 --> 14:18.816
But I think Director Goo prefers Dae Jiang.

14:23.404 --> 14:26.282
Isn’t the person you like Director Goo?

14:32.955 --> 14:35.833
Growing up, was there anyone
you wanted to emulate?

14:37.167 --> 14:38.335
What to imitate?

14:38.419 --> 14:40.671
It’s just that you want to be like that person

14:43.257 --> 14:44.425
Maybe not

14:45.718 --> 14:46.969
i have had

14:47.553 --> 14:49.430
When I first started working in public relations

14:49.513 --> 14:53.601
I knew nothing about this field
so I did a lot of research

14:53.684 --> 14:56.562
Suddenly someone caught my eye

14:57.062 --> 14:59.356
She started out as a reporter in South Korea

14:59.440 --> 15:01.150
Later, he moved to the portal website to do public relations.

15:02.568 --> 15:05.863
She also served as the head of public relations during the U.S. presidential election

15:06.238 --> 15:09.491
He also worked in a consulting company related to corporate sustainability.

15:10.951 --> 15:12.161
Yes, it's her

15:13.287 --> 15:15.289
When I heard the person you like is Director Goo

15:16.332 --> 15:18.876
I felt like you do now

15:22.755 --> 15:25.299
But what can be done? that's the fact

15:25.799 --> 15:27.468
She is someone I can't surpass

15:33.557 --> 15:36.810
I really hope you will have good results

15:39.104 --> 15:40.814
Xiao Zhao! Xiaomin!

15:41.690 --> 15:42.942
Well, here it is!

15:45.903 --> 15:47.780
Yes, I am Xu Dongxun

15:48.155 --> 15:49.740
Today is Saturday, what are your plans?

15:50.240 --> 15:52.743
Well, I don’t have any special plans.

15:53.243 --> 15:55.412
So can you spare some time for me?

15:57.414 --> 15:58.415
What?

15:58.499 --> 16:00.376
You said there's nothing left to do

16:00.918 --> 16:03.879
Of course office workers
cannot spend their golden weekend in such an empty way.

16:05.005 --> 16:06.674
So how do I get through it?

16:07.883 --> 16:09.093
Let's meet first

16:10.177 --> 16:11.720
- That way you'll know
- Thanks

16:11.804 --> 16:14.682
How to spend a perfect Saturday

16:16.684 --> 16:18.519
OK, I will look forward to it

16:21.730 --> 16:24.024
Okay, I'll pass you the location

16:24.400 --> 16:25.484
within one hour

16:26.026 --> 16:26.944
goodbye

16:30.739 --> 16:33.492
Hey, it seems I have to go

16:35.327 --> 16:36.787
I closed all the shops just to come here.

16:36.870 --> 16:37.788
Feel sorry

16:40.082 --> 16:40.958
Is it Representative Xu?

16:42.960 --> 16:45.295
Did Xiao Meng eavesdrop on our conversation at the pig's trotter shop ?

16:45.379 --> 16:46.547
right

16:46.630 --> 16:48.674
It seems like it's going to spread throughout the company.

16:49.633 --> 16:52.386
No wonder everyone says you shouldn’t make appointments to meet near the company

16:53.220 --> 16:54.430
What? Are you going on a date?

16:55.472 --> 16:56.432
Is this the kind of date I know?

16:57.182 --> 16:58.267
I am leaving

17:01.478 --> 17:02.563
What's the situation now?

17:02.646 --> 17:04.481
You were rejected and she went on a date?

17:04.565 --> 17:06.358
Yun Zhao didn’t know I was rejected

17:06.442 --> 17:07.484
Why don't you tell her?

17:08.485 --> 17:09.695
Why tell her?

17:10.112 --> 17:12.448
Said that I felt lonely and uncomfortable after being rejected

17:12.531 --> 17:13.532
Do you want her to comfort me?

17:14.033 --> 17:15.743
That's the real scum, right?

17:18.787 --> 17:19.913
That's true

17:20.497 --> 17:21.415
cheers

17:24.418 --> 17:26.420
(Room 1)

18:01.163 --> 18:02.873
alright…

18:03.540 --> 18:04.708
Stop fighting

18:04.792 --> 18:06.376
what? Why?

18:07.461 --> 18:09.254
It's been 30 minutes, let's go

18:09.338 --> 18:10.881
Then we still have 30 minutes

18:10.964 --> 18:12.591
Because it hurts me to hear

18:12.674 --> 18:14.301
The same drumming sound for 30 minutes

18:14.384 --> 18:16.637
That's why I asked you to wait somewhere else.

18:16.720 --> 18:17.930
You insisted on coming here

18:18.013 --> 18:20.557
Because I didn't know your strength was so bad

18:21.350 --> 18:23.519
Hey, beginners are all like this...

18:24.186 --> 18:25.187
gone

18:25.270 --> 18:26.438
OK

18:29.316 --> 18:31.819
How many interests do you have?

18:32.027 --> 18:33.695
Do you have time to work like this?

18:34.780 --> 18:35.864
Really

18:35.948 --> 18:37.866
She's such a weirdo

18:39.535 --> 18:41.995
Why does she have to come to me to get nervous on the weekend?

18:42.079 --> 18:44.623
No matter how interested I am, it's not her turn to take care of it.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.293
You just let her go like that?

18:48.877 --> 18:49.962
That kid came all the way to find you.

18:51.046 --> 18:52.089
yes

18:52.589 --> 18:54.550
Why don't you take her to have something to eat?

18:58.679 --> 18:59.847
I'm very cautious

19:01.265 --> 19:03.058
Afraid that if she is not careful, she will become

19:03.600 --> 19:04.476
Hate me even more

19:07.396 --> 19:08.313
what is her name?

19:08.397 --> 19:09.690
An Yuzhen

19:10.107 --> 19:12.484
- How come you don't even know her name?
- Yu Zhen, okay

19:13.902 --> 19:15.696
You come back to Korea this time

19:16.405 --> 19:21.577
One of the reasons
should be to repair the relationship with her, right?

19:21.660 --> 19:23.078
That's the main reason

19:25.581 --> 19:27.583
It’s really hard. Let’s have a drink.

19:29.501 --> 19:31.170
It's definitely not easy

19:33.672 --> 19:35.007
but seriously

19:36.008 --> 19:37.342
in my opinion

19:38.177 --> 19:40.137
As long as you can be candid, you'll be fine

19:41.138 --> 19:44.141
If she really hates you that much, I think she...

19:44.433 --> 19:45.851
I mean Yu Zhen

19:45.934 --> 19:47.728
She won't go to the company to find you either

19:50.272 --> 19:51.440
- Really?
- so

19:51.523 --> 19:54.276
You might as well tell her what's on your mind honestly.

19:54.985 --> 19:57.321
"Actually, I don't know what to do

19:57.404 --> 19:58.363
please tell me

19:58.530 --> 20:01.074
I really want to get along well with you."

20:01.158 --> 20:02.284
something like this

20:04.244 --> 20:08.665
What if I say I want to get along with her
and she tells me to go away?

20:08.749 --> 20:10.834
Then just do it, what else?

20:10.918 --> 20:13.462
Hey, who cares if you are her mother or who you are?

20:13.545 --> 20:16.089
If she doesn't like it, you can just get out of here.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.424
not me…

20:18.425 --> 20:22.846
I am her mother, but except for her mobile phone number,
I know little about everything else.

20:23.430 --> 20:25.349
I know nothing about her, am I worthy of being her mother?

20:26.683 --> 20:29.186
Why don't you go see your ex-husband?

20:29.853 --> 20:33.315
As long as you don't want to grab a knife as soon as you meet

20:33.398 --> 20:35.567
The relationship between each other

20:40.530 --> 20:41.823
- Yun Zhao!
- What?

20:41.907 --> 20:43.617
Yun Zhao, do you know Park Yun Zhao?

20:43.700 --> 20:45.535
Agent Park Yoon-so from your company’s PR team 3

20:45.619 --> 20:46.620
What?

20:47.496 --> 20:48.789
How do you know her?

20:49.748 --> 20:51.458
She is the person I took care of at Cao Ya Public Relations

20:52.209 --> 20:54.670
Hey, please take good care of our Yun Zhao

20:54.753 --> 20:56.838
She's a really nice person

20:56.922 --> 21:00.425
I really love her and love her, please.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.970
Why is this world so small?

21:03.053 --> 21:05.639
So you don’t know? small enough

21:05.722 --> 21:08.892
The world is as small as a culture pot full of bean sprouts

21:10.060 --> 21:12.020
- I suddenly want to eat bean sprouts
- What?

21:12.104 --> 21:13.814
Some demand-side platforms

21:13.939 --> 21:17.943
Will utilize both third-party data and first-party data

21:18.026 --> 21:20.696
Some will only use one type of data

21:21.113 --> 21:23.740
But as you can see so far...

21:23.824 --> 21:26.159
A refresher course for current public relations professionals?

21:26.243 --> 21:27.953
When did you start getting involved?

21:28.578 --> 21:30.122
I'll tell you later

21:30.205 --> 21:32.332
Because now it’s me on stage to deliver the speech

21:34.167 --> 21:38.297
(Programmatic advertising in the metaverse)

21:38.380 --> 21:41.591
Okay, let’s continue the speech of Minister Kim Joo-yeon.

21:41.675 --> 21:45.846
Next, I want to explain programmatic advertising in the metaverse.

21:45.929 --> 21:46.930
Please see

21:48.098 --> 21:52.352
The demand-side platform data management platform and supply-side platform mentioned by Minister Jin just now

21:52.436 --> 21:56.231
How will it be presented in the metaverse in the form of advertising...

21:56.315 --> 21:58.066
so for you

21:58.775 --> 22:00.777
This is the perfect way to spend a Saturday

22:00.861 --> 22:02.779
I thought you would like it too

22:02.863 --> 22:04.281
Yes, I like it very much

22:04.740 --> 22:06.783
you really know me

22:07.868 --> 22:09.911
What do you think after listening to the course?

22:11.997 --> 22:13.749
Everyone is really amazing

22:13.999 --> 22:18.045
I'm busy enough just with work
, but I still find time to study these things

22:18.962 --> 22:21.048
It's so hard to make a living

22:21.298 --> 22:23.008
Industries are changing rapidly these days

22:23.091 --> 22:25.010
If you don’t enrich yourself, it will be difficult to keep up.

22:25.135 --> 22:26.345
you are right

22:26.428 --> 22:29.598
The media environment
is always changing at a dizzying pace

22:29.681 --> 22:32.059
So do you want to join us next time?

22:33.101 --> 22:34.102
me?

22:34.186 --> 22:35.687
Oh, forget it

22:36.146 --> 22:37.731
I still have a lot to be desired

22:37.814 --> 22:39.316
what you mean?

22:39.399 --> 22:42.486
I'm grateful that you always give me courage

22:42.778 --> 22:44.029
But now is not the time

22:44.279 --> 22:46.823
I know this very well

22:49.242 --> 22:50.994
To be honest, I really want to participate

22:52.371 --> 22:56.083
If we study together, we can understand more deeply

22:56.166 --> 22:58.210
It can also expand your network of contacts

22:58.835 --> 23:02.047
But now I want to focus on the world

23:02.631 --> 23:06.968
I'm afraid that once I get involved,
I want to do this well but also take care of that.

23:07.469 --> 23:09.096
In the end, he ended up with nothing.

23:09.554 --> 23:11.473
I know exactly where my abilities are

23:11.556 --> 23:13.183
OK, I can understand

23:13.767 --> 23:15.268
I seem to be putting pressure on you invisibly

23:15.894 --> 23:17.604
When the time is right, you can tell me again.

23:17.938 --> 23:19.314
Then we can do it together

23:26.113 --> 23:27.781
Representative Xu, you are a very good person

23:28.490 --> 23:32.160
Because of this, I think I should make it clear to you

23:33.578 --> 23:36.456
I don't
feel that way about you the way you feel about me.

23:37.499 --> 23:38.792
Although you are a good person

23:38.875 --> 23:40.585
But it hasn’t given me the idea of ​​dating yet

23:42.045 --> 23:43.338
besides…

23:45.799 --> 23:49.219
I agreed to date you just to get over
someone

23:51.888 --> 23:56.184
You might think it's selfish
but it's the most effective way

24:02.357 --> 24:06.903
So even if you're disappointed in me
and refuse to continue dating me

24:06.987 --> 24:08.947
- I can accept it calmly...
- I still feel very lucky

24:09.948 --> 24:12.993
At least your reasons aren't the same as refusing a refresher course.

24:13.410 --> 24:14.578
Say you're not ready yet

24:17.372 --> 24:18.540
It’s best to forget as soon as possible

24:19.124 --> 24:20.125
if you want to forget

24:41.521 --> 24:45.734
Everyone, have you seen how popular intranet message boards are
with bullshit chats nowadays?

24:45.817 --> 24:50.614
Everyone said that the server crashed in the middle of the meeting,
which is Shi Yong's usual style.

24:51.406 --> 24:53.283
No, I'm not talking about that

24:53.366 --> 24:56.453
There is a lot of
interest in the internal culture improvement program and looking forward to future developments

24:57.412 --> 24:59.748
Some people also asked when the survey will be conducted

25:00.540 --> 25:03.793
It seems that the server crash has attracted more attention.

25:05.337 --> 25:08.715
But why didn’t Agent Park, the original planner of Sexiang,
say a word?

25:09.341 --> 25:10.926
She should be the happiest person

25:15.972 --> 25:17.557
Is it necessary to do this?

25:17.641 --> 25:18.808
Is there no other way?

25:18.934 --> 25:21.561
Yes, we must use
negative marketing methods

25:22.145 --> 25:23.396
Negative marketing?

25:23.480 --> 25:26.399
Did you know that recently on the market,
only products containing protein powder are

25:26.483 --> 25:28.443
Will they all be popular?

25:28.527 --> 25:30.612
Like high-protein bread or high-protein nutrition bars

25:30.737 --> 25:33.448
But can you trust the ingredients added to those finished products?

25:33.532 --> 25:34.491
No one can guarantee

25:34.574 --> 25:37.953
But our finished products only use
raw materials approved by the Food and Drug Administration

25:38.078 --> 25:38.995
Chi Hyo

25:39.079 --> 25:42.666
Let those
athletes and Internet celebrities with large subscriptions to audio and video platforms

25:42.749 --> 25:44.417
talk about the topic in a roundabout way

25:44.501 --> 25:46.461
We also manipulate social media comments

25:47.796 --> 25:50.757
These are all written in the plan,
you just need to open it and read it.

25:52.676 --> 25:54.344
Is that difficult to understand?

25:54.427 --> 25:56.388
It's not that I can't understand

25:56.471 --> 25:59.391
But if we use negative marketing techniques
to criticize other people’s products

25:59.516 --> 26:01.810
Small manufacturers will suffer a huge blow

26:02.894 --> 26:03.937
so what?

26:04.563 --> 26:06.439
Those things have nothing to do with you

26:08.942 --> 26:12.279
Are you opposed to high-protein bread?

26:12.612 --> 26:15.448
Because that bakery
was the client you were responsible for before joining Seyong

26:15.532 --> 26:16.491
Are you worried that they won't be able to hold on?

26:19.077 --> 26:20.579
But that's your private emotion, right?

26:21.246 --> 26:24.583
You still give me the feeling that you were
Agent Park during the agency period.

26:26.126 --> 26:28.712
It sounds like negative marketing at best
, but it’s basically...

26:34.759 --> 26:36.136
Does Team Leader Chi know about this?

26:36.928 --> 26:38.888
Could she be unaware?

26:38.972 --> 26:41.141
I have already reported these contents to her.

26:41.224 --> 26:42.809
The third-party manufacturer will come over for a meeting today

26:42.892 --> 26:45.186
Team Leader Chi agrees to carry out this project?

26:45.270 --> 26:48.315
Since this case is ongoing
, it means she agrees.

26:51.276 --> 26:52.569
The manufacturer's people are here

26:53.361 --> 26:54.696
Seems like someone you know well

27:05.790 --> 27:08.293
(Cao Ya)

27:08.877 --> 27:10.670
Miss Li Shizhang, this way please

27:15.675 --> 27:17.135
- Yes, how are you doing?
- Hello

27:21.056 --> 27:22.307
world palm

27:24.976 --> 27:26.478
(eCao Ya PR, representative, Li Shizhang)

27:26.561 --> 27:28.855
I opened a small agency

27:29.022 --> 27:30.940
Specialized in managing messages on digital media platforms

27:31.024 --> 27:32.192
Comments and influencers

27:33.276 --> 27:36.237
Why didn't you tell me? I do not even know

27:36.863 --> 27:38.657
So how did Jihyo find you?

27:38.782 --> 27:40.200
that

27:40.283 --> 27:42.535
She said it was difficult to write off expenses through normal channels in this case.

27:42.619 --> 27:44.663
Payment must be made through subcontractors

27:44.871 --> 27:47.791
She saw my name while searching for agents
and called me.

27:48.291 --> 27:49.959
Of course I'm grateful

27:50.752 --> 27:53.004
-Shizhang-
Yes, I know

27:53.755 --> 27:56.049
That high-protein bakery
was once a client of Cao Ya Public Relations

27:56.132 --> 27:59.886
That store is now managed by CEO Kim Hee-young
through Global Communications.

28:01.012 --> 28:02.097
So I have to hide it from her

28:02.180 --> 28:06.017
Even if she doesn't know it was you
, she will know that it was Shi Yong who did it.

28:06.101 --> 28:07.936
It's my job to make sure she doesn't find out

28:09.896 --> 28:11.356
But it's wrong to do this

28:13.066 --> 28:14.192
Director Park

28:15.026 --> 28:16.319
please let me go

28:16.903 --> 28:18.738
Just don't worry about it, okay?

28:18.822 --> 28:21.825
Do you know
how much it costs to have a nanny to take care of twins?

28:25.412 --> 28:28.957
Yun Zhao, I understand, I can understand your mood

28:29.541 --> 28:31.042
But I have to do everything

28:31.960 --> 28:33.753
What's more, this is Se Yong's case

28:33.837 --> 28:36.381
If I handle it
well, I might be able to get other cases.

28:37.507 --> 28:38.925
No matter what, I have to survive

28:40.593 --> 28:42.595
Just open one eye or close one eye.

28:43.179 --> 28:44.931
You are Jihyo’s boss

28:45.014 --> 28:48.101
If you don't agree, the matter may fall through

28:48.685 --> 28:50.103
I can't let that happen

28:51.187 --> 28:54.274
So just do me this favor, okay?

28:56.901 --> 28:58.069
two sets

28:59.863 --> 29:03.825
What is the largest event in the biopharmaceutical industry ?

29:04.659 --> 29:06.828
It's the J.P. Morgan Annual Meeting

29:06.911 --> 29:08.329
Right? That's right

29:08.580 --> 29:10.290
That's held every year in San Francisco

29:11.291 --> 29:13.918
The Public Relations Office will also send two people to participate every year

29:14.002 --> 29:15.086
You also know this, right?

29:15.170 --> 29:17.255
One team leader, one team member

29:18.131 --> 29:20.300
Is it up to you to participate this year?

29:21.259 --> 29:23.011
It's almost like a vacation

29:23.303 --> 29:25.013
I'm here to work, you brat.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.140
Of course, that's work

29:27.515 --> 29:28.641
that

29:28.808 --> 29:30.310
Our second group this time...

29:30.393 --> 29:31.895
Help me score

29:35.940 --> 29:37.025
Seung Hee, do you want to go?

29:40.987 --> 29:42.447
me? Really?

29:43.239 --> 29:45.116
Leader Song, I will be loyal to you!

29:45.200 --> 29:46.618
Oh my God

29:46.701 --> 29:48.036
Is this the army?

29:49.871 --> 29:50.997
She is too excited

30:05.678 --> 30:07.138
Lee Seung Hee is sure to get an A this time

30:10.266 --> 30:11.768
Are you sure that's the case?

30:11.851 --> 30:13.394
Didn’t you also go there after you were promoted to agent?

30:15.605 --> 30:17.357
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.234
I also went there after I was promoted to section chief.

30:19.317 --> 30:22.403
So Lee Seung Hee will definitely get an A this time

30:22.487 --> 30:25.365
Will be promoted to agent smoothly

30:26.157 --> 30:27.450
no doubt

30:31.287 --> 30:32.497
Li Shengxi

30:32.789 --> 30:34.290
Congratulations in advance

30:35.208 --> 30:40.922
(The day for promotion has finally arrived...)

30:41.005 --> 30:42.257
- What's the next sentence?
- Xiao Meng

30:42.340 --> 30:43.550
Are you here to play in the company?

30:45.093 --> 30:45.927
no

30:46.719 --> 30:48.304
That kid just came to the company to have fun.

31:01.109 --> 31:03.027
(expected date of delivery)

31:11.452 --> 31:12.954
Come to the stairwell

31:22.797 --> 31:24.507
Can't we make an appointment somewhere else?

31:24.966 --> 31:26.009
That is to say

31:26.759 --> 31:28.177
You go find somewhere else

31:28.761 --> 31:30.555
There aren't even windows here, it's so stuffy.

31:31.222 --> 31:34.058
It's up to you to find it.
You've been around longer than me.

31:42.066 --> 31:42.984
What do you want to say?

31:48.323 --> 31:50.950
Was the date that day not going well?

31:54.954 --> 31:55.997
what?

31:57.540 --> 32:00.919
The person in charge of the protein powder case in Group 2 is you.

32:01.210 --> 32:02.462
Have you read the plan?

32:04.339 --> 32:05.340
seen it already

32:05.548 --> 32:07.175
It turns out this isn't the first time this has happened.

32:07.634 --> 32:09.344
What you call negative marketing

32:09.427 --> 32:11.679
Now it's done under the table

32:11.763 --> 32:13.181
It was blatant before

32:14.557 --> 32:18.269
This is Shirong’s culture, an outdated system

32:19.479 --> 32:21.648
Se Yong still has a long way to go

32:22.732 --> 32:23.775
Hello

32:23.858 --> 32:26.611
Don't
sound like the leader of the internal culture improvement project team.

32:26.694 --> 32:27.737
tell me what to do

32:28.321 --> 32:30.698
Should I warn the manager of a high-protein bakery?

32:31.282 --> 32:35.703
“There will be messages and comments attacking you online
, so be prepared in advance.

32:35.787 --> 32:39.624
But those are all Se-yong’s tricks behind the scenes.”
Is it going to be like this?

32:41.084 --> 32:43.753
But as a member of Shirong, I shouldn’t do that

32:43.836 --> 32:46.297
It's my responsibility, I'm the one in charge

32:46.381 --> 32:49.842
Then you ask to withdraw from the case
and say that you think that is unethical.

32:49.926 --> 32:51.886
It would be even more irresponsible to do that

32:52.345 --> 32:53.721
Besides, what if I'm the only one who quits?

32:53.805 --> 32:55.223
So what do you want?

32:56.057 --> 32:57.183
I want to know too

32:57.767 --> 32:59.352
I'm so depressed that I'm going crazy

32:59.936 --> 33:01.437
And this also involves Li Shizhang

33:09.612 --> 33:10.571
What?

33:12.156 --> 33:13.449
When did you get pregnant...

33:15.994 --> 33:17.870
No, that's not what I meant

33:19.872 --> 33:21.249
Okay, so...

33:22.709 --> 33:25.003
Then there's no way

33:25.461 --> 33:27.922
How can I travel far away after just giving birth to a baby?

33:28.047 --> 33:29.632
Right? You can't go, can you?

33:29.924 --> 33:30.758
right

33:30.842 --> 33:31.843
Oh, I see

33:34.971 --> 33:36.472
But you got pregnant too quickly...

33:36.806 --> 33:38.182
No, I mean...

33:38.266 --> 33:42.145
Since you are already married, you might as well get pregnant right away

33:43.813 --> 33:46.065
But aren’t you still under 30?

33:46.441 --> 33:49.444
You guys are really anxious. It seems you can't wait any longer.

33:50.611 --> 33:51.779
Oh, sorry

33:52.947 --> 33:54.991
Well, I'm sorry, I talked too much...

33:55.241 --> 33:58.202
Yes, now the country is worried that
the national birth rate is too low

33:59.162 --> 34:01.289
Well done, it's patriotic

34:01.372 --> 34:02.790
Worthy of awards and encouragement

34:04.042 --> 34:05.043
sorry

34:05.793 --> 34:08.254
Please send me there next time

34:08.379 --> 34:10.381
No problem, next time, okay

34:11.049 --> 34:11.924
A year from now?

34:12.842 --> 34:13.801
that

34:14.469 --> 34:15.386
you plan

34:16.179 --> 34:18.014
Taking a long maternity leave?

34:20.516 --> 34:22.310
I'm not sure about that either.

34:22.393 --> 34:25.730
Yes, how can you predict it?
We can only take one step at a time depending on the situation.

34:27.356 --> 34:28.900
Shall I go out first?

34:28.983 --> 34:30.610
- Okay
- Okay

34:33.821 --> 34:35.865
By the way, congratulations

34:36.365 --> 34:37.408
Take good care of your body

34:37.492 --> 34:38.659
Thanks

34:41.162 --> 34:43.956
Hey, I closed the door too loudly

34:44.040 --> 34:45.374
It didn't scare you, did it?

35:06.854 --> 35:07.855
Won't you leave?

35:07.939 --> 35:11.442
When I see Shin Ji Hyo now, I want to beat her up,
so I need to calm down.

35:12.610 --> 35:14.195
I really don't want to go back to the office

35:14.278 --> 35:15.571
Me too

35:15.655 --> 35:16.989
(inbox)

35:17.615 --> 35:18.533
He wrote back

35:18.616 --> 35:20.076
(I am in Genzyme)

35:20.159 --> 35:21.494
(The poster who posted the review of Serong Protein Powder)

35:21.619 --> 35:22.495
Hey, wait a minute

35:24.288 --> 35:25.373
I'm going out in the field

35:26.040 --> 35:27.083
good

35:27.166 --> 35:28.167
I am leaving

35:28.251 --> 35:29.168
Thanks for your hard work

35:48.563 --> 35:51.065
Do you really not want to see me succeed?

35:52.066 --> 35:52.900
no…

35:52.984 --> 35:54.527
Please don't say anything to the team leader

35:55.111 --> 35:56.821
And don't dispute my case.

35:57.363 --> 35:59.323
- Jihyo-
This is my first case

35:59.407 --> 36:01.242
I'll figure it out myself

36:13.963 --> 36:15.256
My name is Yoo Jae-min

36:18.467 --> 36:19.677
not just me

36:19.760 --> 36:22.930
I
bought it after careful research with my friend who works out with me.

36:23.723 --> 36:25.725
Their skin also has allergic reactions

36:28.978 --> 36:30.188
Can I confirm it?

36:34.817 --> 36:36.110
I heard the formula has been upgraded

36:36.611 --> 36:38.738
The ingredients are different from before

36:38.821 --> 36:39.989
I mean it becomes worse

36:43.159 --> 36:43.993
but

36:44.660 --> 36:46.412
Are you really an employee of Serong?

36:46.495 --> 36:48.414
I've called several times before

36:48.831 --> 36:50.750
But you all insist that there is nothing wrong with the product

36:52.001 --> 36:53.336
Who did you talk to on the phone?

36:53.419 --> 36:56.672
I called Shi Rong directly and
they immediately transferred me to the person in charge.

36:57.256 --> 36:59.759
There was a man who said he was the person in charge of protein powder.

37:01.677 --> 37:03.387
- Is that person named Meng...
- By the way

37:03.930 --> 37:06.057
What's it called there? This is where the ingredients are tested

37:06.891 --> 37:08.017
Food and Drug Administration?

37:08.100 --> 37:09.185
Yes, that's right there

37:09.268 --> 37:12.188
He also sent me the inspection report there
and told me there was nothing abnormal.

37:12.772 --> 37:15.524
That’s why I get so angry and post everywhere

37:23.032 --> 37:25.368
(Lawyer, Ahn Eun-seok)

37:28.287 --> 37:31.207
Your secretary told me you haven't gotten off work yet

37:33.417 --> 37:36.128
(KA Law Firm, lawyer, Ahn Eun-seok)

37:36.254 --> 37:37.129
Looks like it's time to fire her

37:37.213 --> 37:38.839
Why fire her for such a trivial matter?

37:38.923 --> 37:42.301
I don't need a
secretary who can't accurately judge the boss's needs.

37:42.885 --> 37:45.096
It’s not like you want to engage in politics with her anyway

37:47.139 --> 37:48.641
I heard about it

37:49.058 --> 37:50.476
you were nominated

37:50.559 --> 37:52.979
Preparing for party primaries

37:54.981 --> 37:56.274
Are you here to talk about my political career?

37:58.150 --> 37:59.819
I feel like you have something to ask me for

38:04.907 --> 38:06.826
The way guests are treated here is really cold.

38:07.243 --> 38:08.369
Just focus on the key points

38:18.379 --> 38:19.213
Yu Zhen

38:23.301 --> 38:25.219
I want to discuss Yu Zhen's matter with you

38:28.014 --> 38:29.265
What to discuss?

38:29.640 --> 38:31.267
how? Doesn't she answer your call?

38:31.892 --> 38:33.352
Are things not going your way?

38:34.770 --> 38:36.564
It seems I guessed it right

38:38.065 --> 38:39.942
- You seem happy
- Yeah

38:40.026 --> 38:41.902
I'm very happy, so happy

38:42.778 --> 38:43.904
But what a pity

38:43.988 --> 38:45.781
I have nothing to say

38:45.865 --> 38:48.200
I won’t discuss anything related to Yu Zhen with you either.

38:52.788 --> 38:55.374
I already knew you would do this
, why did you come all the way?

39:06.719 --> 39:08.929
Don't wear that tie in front of the campaign team

39:09.472 --> 39:11.724
It gives people the feeling of trying to pretend to be young

39:29.784 --> 39:32.328
(Se Yong)

39:42.588 --> 39:46.300
This site is Hapjeong Station

39:54.725 --> 39:57.561
Our representatives are very humorous.

39:57.645 --> 39:59.188
That was just a joke, how could...

39:59.271 --> 40:01.649
- Yes, I am Yoo Jae-min.
- That was just a joke.

40:01.732 --> 40:03.109
There's no need to call the director for this kind of thing, right?

40:03.192 --> 40:04.735
- are you free?
- She has no political stance

40:04.819 --> 40:06.404
- As far as I know, that's it.
- Why did you call the director?

40:06.487 --> 40:07.363
Hello?

40:07.446 --> 40:08.406
- I guess it means nothing else.
- Yeah.

40:08.489 --> 40:09.949
- I'll call you later...
- Please wait.

40:10.032 --> 40:11.117
I'll call you later

40:11.951 --> 40:15.162
What are you doing? Where did Xiao Meng and Hou Ji go?
Didn't they come to work?

40:15.246 --> 40:17.873
They seemed to have had a dinner with the reporters responsible for Se Yong yesterday.

40:17.957 --> 40:20.084
What about you? Why didn't you go?

40:26.006 --> 40:26.882
talk

40:26.966 --> 40:28.759
Because I have something to do

40:30.511 --> 40:34.223
I'm going crazy, really, this brat

40:37.226 --> 40:38.269
Yes, Reporter Kim

40:38.727 --> 40:40.354
(Is she crazy? She actually used soy flour
as a metaphor for a presidential candidate?)

40:40.438 --> 40:42.148
(She should have thought about the consequences before posting this kind of post here
, otherwise it would be even more ridiculous)

40:57.621 --> 40:58.831
represent

40:58.914 --> 41:00.082
Well, what's the matter?

41:00.166 --> 41:02.710
The other party is the presidential candidate of the opposition party

41:03.210 --> 41:04.086
How can you mention soy flour?

41:07.173 --> 41:08.632
(#Oh my God, it’s soybean flour
# If you want to eat it, you should eat it in moderation)

41:08.716 --> 41:10.843
Yes, now we have to talk to the people at the Democratic Party headquarters

41:10.926 --> 41:12.970
- Reporter Jin Minzhi online
- That’s great

41:13.345 --> 41:15.723
The incident caused public concern

41:15.806 --> 41:18.267
- As a party representative...
- Oh, take a picture for me

41:18.350 --> 41:20.019
- what?
- hurry up

41:20.644 --> 41:22.229
The Party’s Ethics Committee and Emergency Response Committee

41:22.313 --> 41:23.230
look here

41:23.314 --> 41:25.858
Relevant persons will be
thoroughly investigated and appropriate...

41:26.984 --> 41:27.943
For justice…

41:29.403 --> 41:31.405
- I hereby promise all citizens...
- Hey, look...

41:32.114 --> 41:33.449
Party representative’s formal apology

41:33.532 --> 41:35.576
- Very good
- I'm afraid it still can't calm the people's anger...

41:35.659 --> 41:38.662
(#久久的吃Out
#The roasted pork rinds in memory)

41:38.746 --> 41:41.207
(#Michelin gourmet restaurant, tastes great
# Drinking soju is the truth)

41:41.290 --> 41:45.336
(#Oh my God, it’s soybean flour
# If you want to eat it, you should eat it in moderation)

41:48.005 --> 41:51.050
So what if you should eat roasted pork rinds with soybean flour ?

41:51.133 --> 41:52.009
represent

41:52.092 --> 41:54.845
Is it necessary to over-interpret a social media post ?

41:56.138 --> 41:57.556
I just felt it at that time

41:58.140 --> 41:59.558
Am I not allowed to express my thoughts?

42:00.100 --> 42:01.977
Isn’t the Republic of Korea a liberal country?

42:02.061 --> 42:06.273
If this were not Korea, I would suggest you

42:06.690 --> 42:08.234
Don't belittle your opponent in this way

42:08.317 --> 42:10.694
Just actively support the candidate you like

42:10.778 --> 42:13.948
That way it will look more stylish

42:14.031 --> 42:16.200
But this is Korea

42:16.283 --> 42:19.078
Koreans are extremely sensitive to political overtones

42:19.161 --> 42:23.916
Although your social media is your personal space
, it also represents the world.

42:24.124 --> 42:27.169
Those who support opposition party candidates

42:27.253 --> 42:30.130
We are already planning to boycott Serong’s brand.

42:30.214 --> 42:32.132
If you are still stubborn

42:32.216 --> 42:34.176
Then just stop running social media.

42:35.719 --> 42:37.346
The risk is too great

42:39.265 --> 42:41.350
Everyone is too sensitive

42:43.727 --> 42:46.355
One post can make a fuss

42:48.983 --> 42:50.859
If the risk posed by the business owner causes the stock price to fall

42:50.943 --> 42:52.861
It will be more difficult to secure the representative’s seat

42:52.945 --> 42:54.738
Do you think the vice president will sit back and do nothing?

42:56.031 --> 42:57.366
Okay, got it

42:57.449 --> 42:58.867
cheer up

43:04.123 --> 43:05.249
So

43:06.166 --> 43:07.501
Could you please clean up the mess?

43:08.127 --> 43:09.211
OK

43:19.138 --> 43:20.389
What to do now?

43:21.181 --> 43:23.225
It can only end with accidental events

43:24.018 --> 43:27.062
They must also be prepared to clarify reports
that the move has no political implications.

43:27.479 --> 43:28.480
Director Gu

43:28.564 --> 43:31.191
Didn’t the representative go to a restaurant at that time?

43:32.318 --> 43:35.029
It would be better if a few
reports about that restaurant could be published

43:35.529 --> 43:37.573
“A barbecue restaurant that even the second generation of rich people will visit

43:37.698 --> 43:39.408
That roasted pork rind is really delicious”

43:39.867 --> 43:41.243
Okay, let's do this

43:41.744 --> 43:42.828
Connect these two paragraphs

43:42.953 --> 43:45.956
And then add a little bit more relevance here...

43:46.665 --> 43:48.876
- I looked for the photo, here it is...
- Yeah

43:48.959 --> 43:50.919
That's not what you call a fancy restaurant

43:51.003 --> 43:53.213
If reporters ask tough questions

43:53.297 --> 43:56.967
It would be better to emphasize that it was just an incident

43:57.051 --> 44:00.346
Sorry, I have no way of knowing that kind of thing

44:00.429 --> 44:02.556
Oh, Agent Kim

44:02.640 --> 44:04.099
The coffee tastes really good

44:04.183 --> 44:05.351
- Does that taste good?
- not bad

44:05.434 --> 44:06.894
The suit looks very nice. Did you buy it new?

44:06.977 --> 44:08.854
I was wearing this suit to see how little you care about me

44:08.937 --> 44:10.522
Hello, first time meeting

44:10.606 --> 44:11.565
Hello

44:11.649 --> 44:13.817
- Hi, I am Kim Hoo-gil from Se Yong Public Relations Team 2
- Yes

44:13.901 --> 44:15.110
You're here

44:16.403 --> 44:17.571
I want to talk to you about that

44:17.655 --> 44:20.824
Our company also has its own position.
Please help us write a favorable report.

44:20.908 --> 44:22.701
- Oh my god, Reporter Kwon
- Oh, Agent Kim

44:23.827 --> 44:24.703
Reporter Goo, how are you doing?

44:24.787 --> 44:26.205
What's going on with Representative Lin?

44:26.288 --> 44:29.583
As long as you show your respect this time,
I will provide you with better materials.

44:30.250 --> 44:33.629
Okay, three, two, one, start

44:33.962 --> 44:34.838
Yes, hello everyone

44:34.922 --> 44:38.133
- We are the "Come for a meal show!" "
- show!

44:38.217 --> 44:40.719
We're going live today with special guests

44:40.803 --> 44:41.887
Come, please introduce yourself

44:41.970 --> 44:45.808
- Hi, I am Xiaolan from Blue Eater Diary
- Welcome Xiaolan

44:45.891 --> 44:47.601
Okay, there are cameras over there too

44:47.685 --> 44:48.519
- Hello everyone!
- Say hello

44:48.644 --> 44:51.438
Come on, cover both the front and back with soybean flour

44:51.522 --> 44:52.648
That's the key to deliciousness

44:52.731 --> 44:54.525
Boss, is this the most important step?

44:54.608 --> 44:56.026
- Please be quiet
- Okay

44:56.110 --> 44:57.486
Looks super delicious

44:57.569 --> 44:58.779
Come

45:01.490 --> 45:02.700
Is it delicious?

45:02.950 --> 45:04.243
taste different

45:04.410 --> 45:06.203
- They did take a good shot.
- Not bad, right?

45:06.286 --> 45:07.204
What does this smell like?

45:07.287 --> 45:09.915
- When was this taken?
- I know that producer very well.

45:09.998 --> 45:11.458
Judging from the comments, the response has been pretty good.

45:11.583 --> 45:13.043
Boss, please pack it for me

45:13.127 --> 45:14.670
Thanks to us, their business should be doing great

45:14.753 --> 45:16.171
- Really
- That restaurant was already very popular.

45:16.255 --> 45:17.965
- Maybe it will be better
- You're back

45:18.048 --> 45:18.966
you are back

45:19.049 --> 45:20.134
(A famous roasted pork rind restaurant that even CEO Se Yong Lim Ji-hyun
is obsessed with)

45:20.217 --> 45:22.845
It's not bad. The report is well written.

45:22.928 --> 45:24.179
Reporter Park was very helpful.

45:24.263 --> 45:26.432
- Thank you for your hard work
- Really well written

45:26.515 --> 45:28.267
- I picked this photo.
- Thank you for your hard work.

45:28.350 --> 45:30.519
- Hey, thank you for your hard work
- Thank you for your hard work.

45:30.602 --> 45:32.479
- Thank you for your hard work
- No, you have worked harder.

45:43.240 --> 45:44.199
Director Gu

45:45.576 --> 45:49.163
I see you handled the aftermath very quickly this time.

45:50.581 --> 45:52.791
In my impression, the public relations team of Shiyong

45:52.875 --> 45:55.252
Never been handled so quickly like this time

45:56.462 --> 45:57.337
Yeah?

45:59.381 --> 46:00.466
What do you want to say?

46:01.341 --> 46:06.263
I'm thinking that this incident was
caused by the vacancy of the head of the Strategy Headquarters.

46:06.889 --> 46:10.184
No one can play coaching chess next to the representative

46:13.604 --> 46:15.814
I will look forward to
the results of the internal culture improvement plan

46:27.951 --> 46:30.537
(Se Yong)

46:35.667 --> 46:37.127
I finally woke up

46:40.130 --> 46:41.507
Did he run out again?

46:42.883 --> 46:45.093
Is his body made of iron?

46:45.260 --> 46:46.762
How can I keep drinking?

46:47.554 --> 46:48.472
elder brother

46:49.973 --> 46:52.684
Have you ever received complaints about protein powder?

46:53.519 --> 46:55.312
I also sent the ingredients inspection report from the Food and Drug Administration to the other party.

46:56.438 --> 46:57.356
No

46:57.439 --> 46:58.273
Yeah?

46:58.357 --> 46:59.191
yes

47:03.529 --> 47:05.322
May I ask where Miss Li Shengxi sits?

47:05.405 --> 47:06.532
here

47:09.701 --> 47:11.829
- Thank you, bye.
- Okay, please walk slowly.

47:14.081 --> 47:15.791
what? Is today her birthday?

47:16.208 --> 47:18.544
Brother, you can't just look at other people's cards

47:19.336 --> 47:20.754
(Seunghee, congratulations on your pregnancy!)

47:20.838 --> 47:22.214
(Are we going to be aunties?)

47:22.297 --> 47:23.715
Seung Hee seems to be pregnant

47:23.799 --> 47:24.716
What?

47:24.800 --> 47:27.094
This was sent by her friend to congratulate her on her pregnancy.

47:28.136 --> 47:29.429
- Really?
- yes

47:32.349 --> 47:33.475
Seung Hee, you...

47:39.398 --> 47:41.650
Don't say anything, and don't congratulate me.

47:48.365 --> 47:49.408
Why?

47:50.367 --> 47:53.704
We need to quickly formulate questionnaire questions
and send them to all employees

47:53.787 --> 47:55.455
This way we can make plans early

48:05.465 --> 48:07.342
I can't go to San Francisco

48:08.260 --> 48:09.887
Because the date overlaps with my due date

48:10.846 --> 48:13.307
I may not be able to be promoted to an agent.

48:14.099 --> 48:17.436
Who would promote someone who is about to take maternity leave?

48:21.815 --> 48:22.816
so

48:23.775 --> 48:24.776
us

48:25.360 --> 48:27.279
Let’s hold a meeting as soon as possible

48:27.905 --> 48:29.114
Well, no problem

48:42.419 --> 48:46.757
I think the questionnaire must be able to assess both
objectivity and relativity

48:46.840 --> 48:49.009
When we break the problem down into fact-finding

48:49.092 --> 48:50.886
When thinking about likeability surveys

48:50.969 --> 48:53.847
You will find that even multiple choice questions are not enough...

48:53.931 --> 48:55.766
Relationship and communication with immediate superiors

48:55.849 --> 48:57.017
Also very important…

48:57.100 --> 48:59.728
That might be a problem between the group members.

48:59.811 --> 49:00.938
Or other team members…

49:01.021 --> 49:02.731
The relationship between the team leader and team members is very important

49:02.814 --> 49:04.524
Because we don’t really know how to interact with other groups…

49:04.608 --> 49:08.070
(High protein bread has no flavor at all and
I don’t understand why anyone would want to eat it…)

49:09.404 --> 49:13.659
Hee Jung, you wrote this part a bit like you were joking

49:13.742 --> 49:16.745
The point is to be a little more aggressive,
okay?

49:17.329 --> 49:19.331
Joo Eun and Jae Hyuk, are you writing smoothly?

49:19.414 --> 49:21.833
- Jaehyuk, write about your own experience
- Yes

49:22.417 --> 49:24.252
No, it’s bad for your health if you write about it

49:24.336 --> 49:25.379
Yes, got it

49:25.462 --> 49:27.297
- Because that's your experience
- Okay

49:27.381 --> 49:29.049
You want to write "The more you eat, the worse your condition becomes."

49:29.132 --> 49:30.050
yes

49:31.760 --> 49:33.220
very good

49:35.138 --> 49:37.224
(No matter how much you eat, you will only get fatter...)

49:37.349 --> 49:38.976
(It’s better to eat chicken breast and eggs.
Who knows what’s added to it?)

49:39.893 --> 49:42.104
(Protein is less than 20 grams at all)

49:42.187 --> 49:43.855
(How can we trust
the protein products on the market?)

49:43.939 --> 49:45.816
(That's all just business strategy)

49:59.287 --> 50:00.288
Hi, sisters

50:00.372 --> 50:01.373
I'm Lanie

50:01.456 --> 50:03.750
Today’s video has nothing to do with sports

50:03.834 --> 50:08.213
You've been eating this kind of high-protein bread a lot lately
to go with your workouts, right?

50:08.422 --> 50:09.923
Look

50:10.298 --> 50:13.927
But what if after in-depth research, you find
high-protein products that are easily available on the market?

50:14.011 --> 50:16.138
What should I do if it’s all garbage?

50:16.221 --> 50:18.140
Yes, these are the products you commissioned

50:18.223 --> 50:21.018
It says that the raw materials are imported protein powder.

50:21.101 --> 50:23.770
But is the origin label consistent with the raw materials?

50:23.854 --> 50:25.480
We are unable to confirm

50:25.564 --> 50:27.274
Through this raw material analysis report

50:27.899 --> 50:31.236
It can be seen that the raw materials used are far below
the standards approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

50:31.319 --> 50:34.406
So are these high-protein breads a bad food?

50:34.489 --> 50:37.284
It has absolutely no that ingredient, it's just garbage

50:38.827 --> 50:40.662
How was the response in the live message area?

50:40.746 --> 50:44.750
Because those films were so offensive
, they got the majority of negative reviews.

50:44.833 --> 50:47.836
First of all, I think we should
distract the public with other issues

50:47.919 --> 50:50.714
I also feel
that this problem needs to be solved as soon as possible

50:50.797 --> 50:51.715
- That's right
- That...

50:51.798 --> 50:55.135
Please be responsible for mastering the method of dissemination first

50:55.218 --> 50:58.346
As for seniors, you'd better go meet a few representatives first...

51:23.330 --> 51:24.873
Eating cup noodles doesn’t seem to be a good idea

51:24.956 --> 51:26.917
Should I order something else to eat?

51:28.502 --> 51:30.170
Is Representative Kim out of town?

51:31.546 --> 51:32.839
She obviously made an appointment with me

51:33.173 --> 51:35.550
That's why I sit here in her place

51:36.384 --> 51:38.136
You can tell me directly

51:38.220 --> 51:40.347
But if I tell you, you won’t come

51:42.516 --> 51:45.018
We haven't seen each other for a while

51:45.310 --> 51:46.770
Didn't get a date either

51:48.021 --> 51:49.564
Because I'm a little busy

51:50.982 --> 51:52.275
Is your heart very busy?

51:56.988 --> 51:59.991
Haven't you successfully promoted
high-protein bread before?

52:00.325 --> 52:02.744
It's not in good condition right now

52:03.411 --> 52:05.664
It seems like someone is tampering with you behind my back

52:06.248 --> 52:09.000
The current sales situation of high-protein finished products is miserable

52:09.167 --> 52:12.712
Representative Kim went out for a countermeasures meeting.

52:12.796 --> 52:13.630
Countermeasures meeting?

52:13.713 --> 52:17.926
Yes, she convened several manufacturers to hold a countermeasures meeting

52:18.802 --> 52:21.429
Is the situation really that bad?

52:24.015 --> 52:26.518
To be honest, it's really miserable

52:26.601 --> 52:28.353
Because they are all small businesses

52:29.062 --> 52:31.815
One of the store managers is currently hospitalized

52:32.232 --> 52:34.776
He must have been under a lot of pressure

52:40.615 --> 52:41.950
I'll order something else

52:42.576 --> 52:44.369
It's our fault

52:45.328 --> 52:46.872
those negative comments

52:47.622 --> 52:49.666
Serong hired subcontractors to do it.

52:52.586 --> 52:53.587
what to do?

53:15.609 --> 53:18.570
(Se Yong)

54:24.219 --> 54:25.595
It was Team Leader Song who asked me to do that.

54:26.221 --> 54:27.931
Ingredients test report from the Food and Drug Administration

54:28.515 --> 54:29.432
He also gave it to me

54:32.602 --> 54:33.853
But what happened?

54:39.859 --> 54:42.404
(Public Relations, Section Chief Meng Zhejun)

54:45.907 --> 54:47.409
Well, brother Zhejun, what's wrong?

54:48.118 --> 54:49.995
Where are you? Why didn't you come to work?

54:50.078 --> 54:52.247
I'm on vacation today, what's wrong?

54:52.330 --> 54:54.291
Apparently you haven't heard of it yet

54:56.084 --> 54:58.962
Doesn't Serong have a
message board to listen to customers' voices?

54:59.587 --> 55:01.464
Something big happened there now

55:02.215 --> 55:04.467
Some people say they want to expose the inside story of Shirong's bullying.

55:05.051 --> 55:06.886
He also said that the person in charge, Park Yoon-soo,

55:07.262 --> 55:10.056
His career was ruined and
even his employees fell down.

55:14.978 --> 55:17.564
I want to expose the domineering and oppressive behavior of the big company Se Yong

55:17.647 --> 55:19.691
I was in the bakery of a bakery called Ang

55:19.774 --> 55:21.526
People who make high protein bread

55:22.110 --> 55:24.195
We have developed various recipes after painstaking research

55:24.279 --> 55:26.823
Healthy ingredients, taste and protein content

55:26.906 --> 55:28.742
We don't do anything carelessly

55:28.825 --> 55:32.412
Later, as the number of customers gradually increased,
an agent saw our potential.

55:32.495 --> 55:34.706
Proposed an online promotion plan to us

55:34.789 --> 55:38.877
Word of mouth via social media
really took off for a while

55:39.461 --> 55:42.172
But starting two weeks ago,
our sales suddenly dropped sharply.

55:43.006 --> 55:46.217
Financial difficulties due to sudden drop in operating income

55:46.301 --> 55:48.094
My friend ended up passing out from the stress.

55:48.178 --> 55:50.263
- Currently in hospital
- Hey, wake up.

55:50.347 --> 55:51.389
(Conglomerate Seyong...)

55:51.473 --> 55:54.309
Later I learned about recent
random malicious attacks on social media

55:55.143 --> 55:58.104
It was instigated by the public relations team of a large company, Serong.

55:59.105 --> 56:01.775
And
the person in charge of such shameless behavior, Miss Park Yun-soo,

56:02.275 --> 56:05.236
It is the person I mentioned earlier who appreciates us

56:05.320 --> 56:07.572
And the person who first proposed to us online promotion

56:09.699 --> 56:12.202
I feel deeply betrayed and can't do anything

56:13.328 --> 56:15.038
This thing hit me hard

56:21.961 --> 56:24.297
We can no longer ignore it, Vice President

56:25.548 --> 56:27.050
From the representative's mistake to this incident

56:27.133 --> 56:29.844
Se Yong’s image continues to collapse

56:30.345 --> 56:32.639
It should be the job of the chief communications officer to prevent this from happening

56:32.806 --> 56:36.101
But after the chief public relations officer took office,
similar troubles emerged one after another.

56:36.684 --> 56:40.146
I can understand that you want to trust Representative Lin
and give her a little more time

56:40.688 --> 56:43.942
But Vice President, now is the time to rectify all this.

56:48.488 --> 56:50.615
You mean to correct all this?

56:52.325 --> 56:54.035
Fire the chief public relations officer

57:01.084 --> 57:03.962
I want to report the big company Serong for trying to monopolize the market.

57:04.754 --> 57:05.839
Bullying

57:07.340 --> 57:08.174
is this real?

57:15.598 --> 57:18.101
I ask you if this is true, Agent Park Yun-soo

57:36.786 --> 57:37.620
Yes

58:24.417 --> 58:26.419
