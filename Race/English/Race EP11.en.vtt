00:37.537 --> 00:40.999
(competition in life)

00:41.082 --> 00:44.002
(The characters, events, groups, organizations
and backgrounds of this drama are purely fictitious. We hereby inform you that)

00:45.295 --> 00:46.421
(Episode 11)

00:46.504 --> 00:48.465
Let's get started

00:50.341 --> 00:52.177
About PR Team 2 Agent Yoo Jae-min

00:52.260 --> 00:53.970
Acted by Park Yun-soo of PR Team 3

00:54.054 --> 00:55.847
The Personnel Committee will now be held

00:58.516 --> 00:59.350
before that

00:59.809 --> 01:02.353
There are other people who are going to be there in person

01:03.313 --> 01:04.147
who is it?

01:21.498 --> 01:23.041
Why is Director Goo here?

01:35.929 --> 01:37.472
Director Goo, would you please preside over it?

01:39.265 --> 01:40.517
How is this going?

02:05.792 --> 02:08.419
(One week before the Personnel Committee is held)

02:11.381 --> 02:14.134
(Se Yong)

02:15.009 --> 02:16.094
Please come in

02:16.177 --> 02:17.846
(General Manager of Sales Department)

02:23.726 --> 02:25.687
Please cancel the convening of the personnel committee

02:28.273 --> 02:29.566
Then I'm afraid I can't do it

02:29.649 --> 02:32.402
Do you really have no idea what
the real problem is?

02:32.485 --> 02:34.946
The PR office should not be blamed for this matter!

02:35.029 --> 02:38.741
No, the PR office must take full responsibility for this

02:38.825 --> 02:41.161
And not just them, but you too

02:41.661 --> 02:44.873
The company is not a charity

02:44.998 --> 02:46.958
How long will I tolerate you?

02:47.041 --> 02:49.669
Why should we suffer
the consequences of your incompetence?

02:49.752 --> 02:51.504
Not to mention not just once, but twice!

02:52.213 --> 02:55.800
If nothing can be done to remedy this situation,
Shi Yonghui will collapse.

02:56.384 --> 02:58.344
I want to prevent that from happening

02:58.428 --> 02:59.637
And that's it for you!

03:03.683 --> 03:05.977
Is the personnel committee going to be convened so soon?

03:06.936 --> 03:10.148
And the target is not the sales manager
but an employee of the public relations office?

03:10.231 --> 03:12.317
Doesn’t that mean the company
wants to push us to take bullets?

03:12.400 --> 03:15.069
Seeing them do all the dirty things
makes people more convinced that there must be something evil.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.322
What on earth were they trying to cover up
to get to this point?

03:17.405 --> 03:18.531
Hello

03:18.615 --> 03:21.534
When did Team Leader Song get involved
and how did he get involved?

03:22.785 --> 03:24.120
I asked him

03:25.163 --> 03:27.624
- But he avoided the question
- would he openly admit it?

03:28.416 --> 03:31.211
How could any fool go and ask him face to face?

03:31.294 --> 03:32.545
And you are the fool

03:32.629 --> 03:33.963
Damn it, you scared me

03:35.715 --> 03:37.383
You said you want to hold an emergency countermeasures meeting?

03:38.968 --> 03:41.638
No matter what the name of this meeting is,

03:42.222 --> 03:44.057
But the current situation is indeed urgent

03:44.140 --> 03:46.726
What will happen if a personnel committee is convened?

03:46.809 --> 03:48.895
That's just a necessary process for making punishments

03:49.479 --> 03:51.356
Now there are rumors outside

03:51.439 --> 03:54.776
If you are punished,
it will be Director Goo’s turn next.

03:55.193 --> 03:57.237
Why is everyone targeting Director Goo?

03:57.320 --> 03:59.906
Why is everyone so anxious to remove her?

04:02.659 --> 04:04.327
Now that's not the point

04:04.744 --> 04:06.788
But what do you two plan to do?

04:07.705 --> 04:11.417
This forged ingredient analysis list given to Houji by Team Leader Song

04:11.501 --> 04:13.336
I think we should start investigating from here

04:18.383 --> 04:19.717
Scared me

04:20.760 --> 04:21.844
It's clearly visible from outside

04:22.095 --> 04:23.721
Why should countermeasures meetings be held in the company?

04:23.805 --> 04:25.932
-There are eyeliners everywhere here
-Seunghee

04:28.184 --> 04:29.852
What you plan to do is also our share.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.105
Seung Hee

04:33.439 --> 04:36.401
It seems like I haven’t seen Agent Xu for a long time.

04:36.484 --> 04:38.611
I also want to help you

04:38.695 --> 04:41.531
I can't put all the blame on you two.

04:42.490 --> 04:43.616
That's wrong

04:44.784 --> 04:45.868
Agent Xu

04:46.786 --> 04:48.454
I can't tell you are so good at talking

04:50.331 --> 04:51.541
What to do? What to start with?

04:56.421 --> 04:59.257
My problem is no longer
within our capabilities

04:59.340 --> 05:01.676
Let’s all help solve Agent Liu’s problem together .

05:01.759 --> 05:03.928
Now who leaked that report?

05:04.012 --> 05:05.388
It's no longer the point

05:05.722 --> 05:07.682
Then go inquire about the sales team.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.351
My connections are no joke

05:15.023 --> 05:16.232
but

05:16.316 --> 05:19.569
We should also solve
the problem of Agent Park, right?

05:20.194 --> 05:21.487
That negative marketing

05:22.780 --> 05:27.660
I heard from Jihyo that you
were actually firmly opposed to it at the beginning.

05:29.203 --> 05:31.497
So why should you be punished alone?

05:32.999 --> 05:36.627
I believe you and like you

05:44.469 --> 05:45.845
Hey, what is this?

05:45.928 --> 05:48.639
By the way, this is the ingredient analysis table,
show it to them.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.266
Well, that is to say

05:50.350 --> 05:52.685
This is the ingredient analysis list given to Houji by Team Leader Song

05:52.769 --> 05:53.728
right

05:53.811 --> 05:55.438
This is the analysis table I commissioned separately.

05:55.521 --> 05:57.607
(Is Shi Yong not related to the death of the boss of a certain outsourcing company ?)

05:58.983 --> 06:00.777
Well, this is very well written.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.570
But Jae Min…

06:02.653 --> 06:03.696
Huiying

06:03.780 --> 06:05.615
This is not something you should feel guilty about

06:05.698 --> 06:08.659
You didn't peek on purpose, you
just happened to see it

06:09.035 --> 06:10.745
Didn’t you also tell Cai Min?

06:10.828 --> 06:14.415
I only said
it after I decided to write the report. At most, it was just to inform him.

06:14.499 --> 06:18.878
If you pretended not to know for Jaemin's sake,
would you feel better now?

06:19.462 --> 06:21.756
I don't think so, you must be very anxious

06:21.839 --> 06:24.592
I guess we don't have to worry about Jae Min

06:29.722 --> 06:30.932
I like you

06:32.600 --> 06:34.143
I said I like you

06:34.227 --> 06:35.186
Come date with me

06:35.853 --> 06:37.688
You don’t have a date right now, do you?

06:43.569 --> 06:44.821
Have you ever dated a girl?

06:46.155 --> 06:48.324
Here we go again, you asked the same question

06:51.119 --> 06:53.079
But does it matter whether you’ve been in a relationship or not?

06:53.621 --> 06:54.872
important

06:55.456 --> 06:57.250
Very important

06:57.834 --> 06:58.918
in Korea

06:59.377 --> 07:01.504
This kind of relationship cannot be disclosed easily

07:02.088 --> 07:03.756
Suppose someone asks you if you have a date

07:03.840 --> 07:05.633
Then he asked when you plan to get married.

07:06.342 --> 07:08.177
You can't answer this kind of question at all

07:08.886 --> 07:11.055
Over time, you will start to think about giving up.

07:12.515 --> 07:15.852
“I want to show off my significant other to others
and receive blessings from others

07:15.935 --> 07:18.187
I also want to have ordinary love in the eyes of others.”

07:19.105 --> 07:20.606
In the end you will choose to leave

07:21.065 --> 07:23.109
Those who think there is no difference

07:24.026 --> 07:26.362
Maybe I haven't thought about this problem at all

07:29.031 --> 07:30.158
In short

07:32.118 --> 07:36.122
It's something to be grateful for when someone likes me,
so thank you.

07:37.039 --> 07:37.999
It seems…

07:39.125 --> 07:40.710
You are quite extreme

07:41.210 --> 07:42.753
As you say

07:42.837 --> 07:46.007
In Korea, as long as you get blessings from others,
you can have an ordinary love in the eyes of others.

07:46.090 --> 07:47.592
Will they never break up?

07:48.801 --> 07:50.344
If we break up because of other people

07:50.428 --> 07:52.221
That love was doomed to fail from the beginning

07:52.763 --> 07:55.349
If not,
it means that the breakup was just because we no longer loved each other.

07:57.185 --> 07:59.979
I've already confessed to you

08:01.063 --> 08:05.276
But my desire to date you has not changed.
Please think about it carefully.

08:06.402 --> 08:08.779
I think the problem is not with me, but with you

08:11.240 --> 08:12.825
Look at the way you are pretending to be awesome

08:13.409 --> 08:15.119
I am already very powerful, don’t you know?

08:26.005 --> 08:28.424
That really makes you want to curse, right?

08:28.508 --> 08:29.634
Damn it makes me want to curse

08:30.218 --> 08:32.345
Calm down, don't get excited

08:34.222 --> 08:35.890
He said I was incompetent

08:37.475 --> 08:41.771
I really don’t understand
which period drama Se Yong is acting in

08:42.230 --> 08:45.566
Alas, Seyong is essentially a pharmaceutical company.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.360
that kind of place

08:48.110 --> 08:49.820
somewhat conservative

08:49.904 --> 08:51.280
They don't even have any common sense

08:51.364 --> 08:52.949
Because the standards are different

08:53.032 --> 08:55.868
Hey, how can there be any so-called standards for common sense?

08:55.952 --> 08:58.037
What the public thinks is right is common sense

08:58.120 --> 09:00.164
If everyone has their own standards,
how can it be called common sense?

09:00.248 --> 09:02.583
Have worked in the company for a long time

09:02.667 --> 09:05.127
People's standards may be shaken

09:05.211 --> 09:07.838
Otherwise, why would anyone be willing to
accept the mistakes made by company representatives?

09:07.922 --> 09:09.549
Are you still sacrificing your life for the company?

09:09.632 --> 09:10.466
Not at all

09:10.550 --> 09:12.301
That's because they are afraid

09:12.385 --> 09:14.345
The life I have devoted my whole life to is worthless.

09:14.428 --> 09:16.097
Only then will your own value change...

09:18.432 --> 09:21.060
I really don’t understand that kind of person, my God!

09:21.644 --> 09:24.105
I heard what you said

09:25.231 --> 09:27.650
Suddenly reminds me of a certain bastard from before

09:28.442 --> 09:29.318
Which bastard?

09:29.402 --> 09:31.153
When I was an agent

09:32.530 --> 09:36.158
Reported a supervisor’s wrongdoing to the Inspection Team

09:36.242 --> 09:42.206
But some bastard who knows that better than anyone else

09:42.456 --> 09:44.500
But when questioned by the inspection team, he denied it completely

09:44.834 --> 09:47.628
Choose to protect your boss

09:48.129 --> 09:50.590
This is too ridiculous

09:50.673 --> 09:54.302
So I was labeled an insider whistleblower.

09:54.927 --> 09:58.556
After that, everyone obviously
avoided me

09:58.806 --> 10:00.725
I was not admitted through open recruitment in the first place.

10:00.808 --> 10:02.268
But he was a journalist and was specially hired.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.895
Now I'm even more annoying

10:05.396 --> 10:07.940
Even promotion has become out of reach

10:10.735 --> 10:12.194
so i left

10:13.696 --> 10:14.822
I'm talking about Se Rong

10:16.157 --> 10:17.325
Shi Rong?

10:17.408 --> 10:18.784
Yes, Se Yong

10:18.868 --> 10:21.203
Oh my God! So fed up

10:21.579 --> 10:22.622
drink

10:30.671 --> 10:32.006
But Yi Jung

10:32.965 --> 10:34.842
Don't give up

10:35.426 --> 10:36.344
Why?

10:36.636 --> 10:40.931
Although you may not be able to change anything on your own

10:42.058 --> 10:44.310
But if you don't care about me

10:44.393 --> 10:47.021
There's no chance to change again

10:51.275 --> 10:52.401
(Representative, Xu Dongxun)

11:03.079 --> 11:04.664
-Do you want to go there now?
-Yes, senior

11:04.747 --> 11:06.999
I heard that you prepared those all by yourself.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.584
You should let others share the burden.

11:08.668 --> 11:09.710
Because it concerns Se-yong

11:10.086 --> 11:11.879
Everyone is running for Ang's bakery

11:11.962 --> 11:13.506
I should do this

11:15.424 --> 11:17.718
After all, Shirong is also our client.

11:17.802 --> 11:19.387
we have no choice

11:19.553 --> 11:21.055
But you can’t ask them for money, right?

11:21.138 --> 11:21.972
right

11:22.056 --> 11:24.684
They should hope that
we can give away online monitoring services

11:24.767 --> 11:26.310
I think so

11:26.435 --> 11:28.020
Anyway, thank you for your hard work

11:28.104 --> 11:29.689
- No
- That’s right

11:29.772 --> 11:32.024
It's a representative's job to deal with this kind of thing, right?

11:32.108 --> 11:33.025
That's right

11:40.908 --> 11:41.992
oh

11:42.076 --> 11:43.077
good

11:44.078 --> 11:46.539
I heard that Representative Xu worked very hard on this matter.

11:48.666 --> 11:49.667
so what?

11:49.750 --> 11:52.044
He came here for online monitoring of protein powder.

11:52.128 --> 11:53.629
It is required by the directors

11:53.754 --> 11:54.922
that?

11:55.548 --> 11:58.926
In short, the responsible unit is Global Communications,
I believe you will do a good job.

12:00.594 --> 12:03.139
No, you must behave well

12:03.222 --> 12:05.850
Shirong is not a company that is easy to bully

12:07.101 --> 12:09.520
How easy is it to make other people's money?

12:10.229 --> 12:11.063
Isn't it?

12:11.939 --> 12:14.608
Yes, you are right

12:15.735 --> 12:19.697
At least Director Chen still wants to talk to you in person.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.991
Yes, thank you for taking such good care of me

12:24.452 --> 12:26.120
The situation is not optimistic, right?

12:26.996 --> 12:27.955
right

12:30.666 --> 12:32.835
In addition to Representative Lin’s personal account

12:32.918 --> 12:36.338
And all social media comment areas managed by Shi Yong

12:36.422 --> 12:37.923
It's best to close them all temporarily

12:38.007 --> 12:39.508
I checked on the way here

12:39.592 --> 12:41.677
The Internet is now filled with calls for crusade

12:41.761 --> 12:42.720
OK

12:43.637 --> 12:45.598
Yes, thank you for confirming it for us

12:46.056 --> 12:47.224
Okay, I'll take my leave then

12:49.351 --> 12:50.978
Wait, that...

12:52.021 --> 12:55.399
I heard your clients are also involved.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.694
I didn't expect you to take care of this personally.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.155
On the one hand, I also think
our request is too unreasonable.

13:01.238 --> 13:02.865
as i just said

13:02.948 --> 13:05.951
Global Communications is a partner of Serong

13:06.035 --> 13:09.163
All we do is try our best to meet customer requirements

13:09.830 --> 13:11.707
Please remember this

13:12.541 --> 13:13.959
Okay, I'll keep it in mind

13:14.835 --> 13:15.878
OK, bye

13:26.847 --> 13:28.098
take care

13:38.943 --> 13:41.487
He also gave me the ingredients test report from the Food and Drug Administration.

13:41.946 --> 13:44.949
You have nothing to do with this?

13:46.325 --> 13:47.201
What did you say?

13:47.910 --> 13:49.537
If you didn't hear it, let me ask again

13:51.372 --> 13:52.373
Team leader

13:53.541 --> 13:55.000
You and this protein powder incident

13:56.126 --> 13:58.212
No connection at all?

14:11.350 --> 14:13.477
Agent Guo, if you know anything, just tell me.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.312
Senior, I really don’t know anything.

14:15.396 --> 14:17.314
How could you, the ace of the sales team, know nothing?

14:17.398 --> 14:18.357
-Senior
-huh?

14:18.440 --> 14:19.733
I really don't know anything

14:19.817 --> 14:22.444
That was all done by Team Leader Zhao alone.

14:22.528 --> 14:23.779
I go first

14:24.530 --> 14:26.115
Agent Guo

14:28.826 --> 14:32.788
Team Leader Zhao has the sole authority to handle the upgrade of the protein powder formula this time.

14:32.955 --> 14:34.957
So the other groups don’t know anything about it.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.752
This is the ingredient analysis information you requested

14:39.920 --> 14:40.838
Only this?

14:40.921 --> 14:41.839
right

14:42.423 --> 14:43.632
research group to date

14:43.716 --> 14:46.302
I still have the ingredient analysis table previously issued by Dongxin.

14:47.052 --> 14:49.346
(Equipment warehouse)

14:49.972 --> 14:52.766
Yes, there are limits to what we can do

14:52.850 --> 14:53.809
Do you want

14:54.810 --> 14:56.312
Report directly to the inspection team?

14:56.812 --> 14:58.397
Do you want everyone to quit?

14:58.689 --> 15:00.190
Then the public relations office will really collapse.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.735
Houji should be able to survive.

15:02.818 --> 15:05.696
That brat said he didn't want to have anything to do with it

15:06.530 --> 15:08.073
I will survive too

15:08.157 --> 15:09.575
Otherwise, who will make the money for milk powder?

15:10.701 --> 15:13.078
So don’t even think about reporting it to the inspection team.

15:14.663 --> 15:15.539
In this case

15:16.582 --> 15:18.292
I'll tell you what's really the key

15:21.795 --> 15:22.671
Team Leader Song

15:24.465 --> 15:25.674
We need to investigate him further.

15:27.051 --> 15:29.595
Then do you want to meet the other team leaders?

15:30.220 --> 15:31.722
I'll go find Team Leader Chi

15:33.432 --> 15:34.725
Team leader pool?

15:48.822 --> 15:51.700
This is no longer a problem we can solve

15:52.368 --> 15:54.453
what i can do for you

15:54.536 --> 15:57.915
Just to help you reduce the punishment as much as possible

16:00.626 --> 16:02.836
But I'm not sure now whether I can do it

16:03.337 --> 16:05.005
Not to mention the other team members' affairs.

16:06.256 --> 16:07.341
besides

16:07.424 --> 16:09.218
Senior Song should also have his own reasons

16:09.927 --> 16:11.178
And I can't ignore that

16:14.473 --> 16:15.474
Caimin agent

16:16.308 --> 16:18.227
It seems wrong to do this

16:19.228 --> 16:20.646
How can I…

16:21.939 --> 16:23.899
How could I stab Team Leader Song in the back?

16:23.983 --> 16:27.236
No, I'm not asking you to do this, Team Leader Cui

16:27.695 --> 16:29.613
i just hope you

16:30.572 --> 16:33.367
Can you help us thoroughly investigate the ins and outs of this matter?

16:33.450 --> 16:35.160
That's what it means to me

16:36.036 --> 16:38.914
You want to investigate deeply everything related to Team Leader Song?

16:41.542 --> 16:42.751
me

16:43.085 --> 16:46.171
The reason why I can still stay in this company till now

16:46.880 --> 16:47.840
It depends on loyalty

16:49.466 --> 16:54.555
I will never do anything that harms the organization or my colleagues

16:56.515 --> 16:58.392
Maybe you will be disappointed after hearing this

17:01.395 --> 17:02.688
But that's who I am

17:05.441 --> 17:07.484
Just pretend that what we met today never happened.

17:08.986 --> 17:10.320
Take care of yourself

17:19.663 --> 17:20.914
I'll pay the bill

17:47.107 --> 17:48.025
Let’s go find Director Goo

17:48.901 --> 17:53.238
She has the right to investigate this matter
and I believe she will do the same.

17:53.322 --> 17:54.990
But there is so little evidence

17:55.407 --> 17:59.328
The only evidence we have is the ingredient analysis table

18:01.663 --> 18:03.624
Besides, her current situation is not very good either.

18:03.707 --> 18:04.958
I know everything

18:05.834 --> 18:08.462
But she's our last resort

18:10.214 --> 18:13.634
It also takes courage to ask a good boss for help

18:17.304 --> 18:19.681
About the Victims of the Protein Powder Incident

18:20.224 --> 18:22.267
What does the sales team think?

18:22.351 --> 18:24.394
Yes, because this incident is not simple

18:24.478 --> 18:27.981
Therefore, the sales team also attaches great importance to this matter
and decided to recall all products

18:28.065 --> 18:28.941
good

18:29.858 --> 18:32.069
In addition, reporter Choi Huiying of Daguo Ilbo

18:32.736 --> 18:35.155
The ingredient analysis table she presented...

18:35.239 --> 18:36.406
but

18:37.074 --> 18:41.328
The analysis form provided to us by the Food and Drug Administration
shows that there is no problem

18:44.581 --> 18:46.166
certainly

18:46.250 --> 18:51.463
Analysis results will
vary depending on the sample analyzed.

18:51.547 --> 18:54.633
I guess that's
why the company decided to recall all the products

18:54.716 --> 18:55.801
So the samples are different?

18:58.095 --> 18:59.012
right

19:02.099 --> 19:03.684
That, Director Goo

19:04.351 --> 19:05.769
According to Director Chen

19:06.353 --> 19:09.189
The company has decided to take punishment

19:09.773 --> 19:13.443
And punishing those two people is
the biggest apology the company can express.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.449
Is Director Chen in the company now?

19:19.533 --> 19:21.910
He scheduled a vacation before the personnel committee convened.

19:22.202 --> 19:23.495
The phone is also turned off

19:26.540 --> 19:31.879
What's the point of having a meeting with just a few of us
?

19:32.379 --> 19:34.131
This matter seems to have been decided...

19:37.092 --> 19:38.260
okay, I get it

19:38.343 --> 19:39.469
You guys go out

19:44.141 --> 19:46.602
Director Goo seems to be helpless.

19:46.685 --> 19:48.103
that's what i want to say

19:48.187 --> 19:50.022
This is what I just wanted to say

19:50.439 --> 19:53.066
Wait, you really have to watch the PR office.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.902
Reduced to a state of fragmentation?

19:54.985 --> 19:57.487
What can we do?
The PR office is the weakest department

20:05.495 --> 20:06.371
Um

20:16.506 --> 20:20.344
This is not something that a mere sales team leader
can accomplish alone.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.804
Unless someone high-level is helping him behind the scenes

20:24.097 --> 20:24.932
right

20:25.015 --> 20:26.391
And that ingredient analysis table...

20:26.475 --> 20:30.145
Team Leader Song Xuantai just reported this matter to me

20:30.729 --> 20:32.356
He said because the samples were different

20:32.773 --> 20:37.277
The ingredient analysis table provided by the Food and Drug Administration
shows that Se Yong’s sample did not ask...

20:37.361 --> 20:38.195
No

20:38.987 --> 20:40.030
The samples are the same

20:41.698 --> 20:44.409
The person who provided the analysis table was also team leader Song Xuantai

20:44.493 --> 20:45.786
You said the samples are the same?

20:46.328 --> 20:47.162
right

20:58.799 --> 20:59.967
Director Gu

21:01.510 --> 21:05.889
I didn't express my suspicions to save myself.

21:06.723 --> 21:08.100
I don't think so either

21:08.684 --> 21:11.520
What can be found out or resolved before convening the personnel committee ?

21:11.603 --> 21:12.771
if not?

21:12.854 --> 21:15.983
The reason why I decided to tell you these things

21:16.733 --> 21:17.651
Because of

21:18.902 --> 21:23.824
I don't think you're going to ignore this like the rest of Seyong's senior management.

21:25.075 --> 21:27.828
You won't give up just because you're in a disadvantaged position.

21:29.997 --> 21:32.040
Even after the personnel committee ends

21:33.000 --> 21:34.668
I also hope you can find out about this

21:35.377 --> 21:37.254
but after that

21:40.299 --> 21:42.759
I might not be alive anymore

21:44.386 --> 21:46.555
In other words, if you want to launch an investigation

21:46.930 --> 21:49.099
We have to hurry up before the personnel committee convenes.

21:51.101 --> 21:52.102
so

21:52.686 --> 21:55.230
It 's time for us to stop being silent
and show them.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.857
As the saying goes, "A dog in a hurry will jump over the wall."

21:56.940 --> 21:58.150
So what to do?

21:58.608 --> 22:00.736
-Will everyone resign together?
-Don't do that

22:01.028 --> 22:03.697
Slogans like "We want to get to the bottom of things"

22:04.114 --> 22:05.240
How about uploading it to the company discussion forum?

22:05.324 --> 22:06.450
"Find out the truth thoroughly"?

22:06.908 --> 22:08.118
You are exaggerating too

22:08.785 --> 22:12.039
Have you ever participated in a protest?
Do you know what a petrol bomb is?

22:12.122 --> 22:14.041
It seems you are quite experienced

22:14.124 --> 22:16.460
In fact, Agent Liu was also wrong, wasn't he?

22:17.127 --> 22:19.004
I heard that reporter is his friend

22:19.212 --> 22:21.048
This means that he has no self-awareness as a publicist

22:21.631 --> 22:24.134
Also, the person mentioned in the forum post is Agent Park.

22:24.718 --> 22:27.429
In my opinion, those who do wrong
should be punished

22:27.512 --> 22:28.388
wrong

22:29.514 --> 22:30.557
it's not like that

22:30.640 --> 22:32.309
Agent Yoo did not leak any information.

22:33.310 --> 22:35.896
Besides, that's not the point.

22:36.021 --> 22:38.398
Something happened but you just want to cover it up,
that's the real problem

22:38.565 --> 22:39.649
As for Agent Park

22:39.733 --> 22:41.985
She's just a scapegoat

22:42.402 --> 22:44.946
You don’t even know this and
you dare to call yourself a public relations office employee?

22:48.992 --> 22:51.078
Anyway, let’s wait until the disciplinary action comes out.

22:51.578 --> 22:52.788
Maybe they'll get away with it.

22:52.871 --> 22:55.290
Then we will look like fools

23:09.471 --> 23:12.474
Don't gather everyone to talk about what you have and what you don't have.

23:13.475 --> 23:14.893
Where did Agent Park go?

23:15.894 --> 23:17.813
She just said she was going to the hospital

23:17.896 --> 23:20.357
Visit the proud bakery owner

23:20.565 --> 23:21.608
I went to see him too

23:21.691 --> 23:22.859
Why are you going?

23:22.943 --> 23:24.778
Because I feel so sorry

23:25.487 --> 23:29.032
The thought of someone passing out from
the amount of stress I'm under

23:29.491 --> 23:31.535
My mood is very heavy

23:37.207 --> 23:39.543
The current market response is gradually changing

23:39.626 --> 23:42.421
Ang’s bakery sales have also gradually picked up

23:57.310 --> 23:58.812
Sorry, boss

23:59.438 --> 24:00.981
it's all my fault

24:01.523 --> 24:02.691
You say you have no choice

24:02.774 --> 24:03.692
no

24:04.067 --> 24:06.153
That's what everyone says to me

24:07.696 --> 24:10.490
But I should fight to the death to stop them

24:10.991 --> 24:13.910
If I can't do
that, then I should leave that company.

24:15.162 --> 24:16.288
but

24:16.872 --> 24:18.290
Sorry I didn't do that

24:19.708 --> 24:21.835
I'm also sorry that I delayed coming until now.

24:23.044 --> 24:23.962
to be honest

24:24.671 --> 24:26.506
I'm scared

24:27.215 --> 24:29.634
I'm afraid that Boss Huang might have something unexpected happen to him

24:30.552 --> 24:35.182
I'm also afraid that after we actually meet, you will all blame me.

24:38.518 --> 24:39.561
sorry

24:40.395 --> 24:41.229
that…

24:41.938 --> 24:43.899
If I have to say it, it’s Se Rong’s fault.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.067
I still know this

24:46.318 --> 24:47.444
But look

24:47.527 --> 24:49.279
You are the only one who apologizes

24:49.362 --> 24:53.450
How long has it been since I uploaded that post?
Saeyong hasn’t even made an official statement.

24:53.533 --> 24:54.743
sorry

24:56.036 --> 24:58.747
This is all I can say now

25:04.794 --> 25:07.547
(Se Yong)

25:10.467 --> 25:12.761
If this continues, we will all be fired, right?

25:12.844 --> 25:14.221
Then take the legal route

25:14.304 --> 25:15.305
correct

25:15.764 --> 25:17.057
Your mother is a judge, right?

25:18.558 --> 25:19.643
Why are you saying this suddenly?

25:19.726 --> 25:22.687
Then she must know many relevant people in the legal field

25:23.522 --> 25:25.607
At least it will be beneficial to us in the lawsuit

25:27.192 --> 25:28.902
My mother should know a lot of people

25:29.402 --> 25:30.278
but I do not have

25:30.362 --> 25:32.739
Yes, you have a bad relationship with your mother

25:32.822 --> 25:35.367
Yes, we don’t have a good relationship, and we haven’t seen each other for a long time.

25:38.328 --> 25:40.705
Every time your mother is mentioned, you lose your temper

25:41.957 --> 25:42.832
how about you?

25:43.792 --> 25:45.293
You still refuse to call her mother

25:45.377 --> 25:47.671
My situation is different from yours

25:47.754 --> 25:50.257
Don't compare you to me

25:51.091 --> 25:55.637
Yeah, your situation is
worse than mine, bleak and miserable.

25:55.762 --> 25:59.307
-Are you satisfied?
-When you said that, I felt worse again.

26:03.770 --> 26:04.813
It's time to prepare

26:10.527 --> 26:11.736
Are you relaxing now?

26:11.820 --> 26:12.696
Absolutely not

26:18.994 --> 26:23.456
Before convening the personnel committee of Deputy Yoo Jae-min
and Deputy Park Yoon-so

26:23.540 --> 26:26.501
There's something I need to confirm first

26:26.585 --> 26:30.755
It’s about the launch process of protein powder products with upgraded formulas

26:31.631 --> 26:35.927
What does that have to do with the case being heard by the Personnel Committee today
?

26:36.803 --> 26:39.347
Manufacturers supplying protein powder raw materials have made changes

26:39.431 --> 26:40.640
I think you all should know

26:41.141 --> 26:44.185
Switched from Dongshin to PF

26:44.269 --> 26:45.312
And this new manufacturer

26:45.687 --> 26:49.482
It's a company run by a relative of Zhao Zhenrui, the leader of the sales team.

26:50.025 --> 26:52.944
Whether it is factory facilities, manpower or R&D capabilities

26:53.028 --> 26:56.615
They are extremely backward in every aspect
and are a messed up company.

26:56.698 --> 26:59.951
Therefore, defective products are an expected result

27:00.035 --> 27:02.871
Moreover, when there are already victims

27:02.954 --> 27:06.458
They even teamed up with each other to cover it up

27:07.834 --> 27:10.211
What on earth are you talking about?

27:10.920 --> 27:13.256
-You like playing golf, right?
-What?

27:15.592 --> 27:16.843
It's just a simple question

27:17.677 --> 27:19.429
Do you like to play golf?

27:31.900 --> 27:34.653
(One day before the personnel committee meeting)

27:47.207 --> 27:49.709
You are here, but why are you here?

27:50.627 --> 27:52.253
Can we have a chat?

28:04.933 --> 28:07.602
i have been thinking

28:09.187 --> 28:12.565
“
What is Team Leader Song Xuantai’s stance on this matter?

28:13.566 --> 28:17.946
How deeply involved is he with Team Leader Zhao's corruption?

28:19.280 --> 28:21.533
Does he have no idea, or is he just...

28:23.201 --> 28:24.744
The core figure in this corruption incident?

28:25.286 --> 28:30.583
If not, does he
play the role of a ghost in this round? "

28:31.626 --> 28:32.669
All right

28:32.961 --> 28:34.462
maybe you don't know

28:35.130 --> 28:38.466
The ingredient analysis sheet that I handed over...

28:41.511 --> 28:42.846
is fake

28:45.056 --> 28:48.560
If you just accept
the analysis table given by Team Leader Zhao

28:50.311 --> 28:52.897
Although Team Leader Zhao is from the same hometown as you,

28:52.981 --> 28:55.024
I'm also a junior from the same school as you.

28:55.775 --> 29:01.698
But you may have nothing to do with Team Leader Zhao’s corruption.

29:02.532 --> 29:03.366
right

29:04.200 --> 29:07.036
I might think so

29:07.871 --> 29:08.872
but

29:09.706 --> 29:13.042
This seems unjustifiable to anyone.

29:13.626 --> 29:15.545
Especially someone like Se Yong

29:15.837 --> 29:18.590
Relying on personal connections and alumni relationships to build bridges

29:18.673 --> 29:20.467
support each other

29:20.550 --> 29:23.136
This is especially true for companies that provide help

29:23.219 --> 29:24.471
Director Gu…

29:24.554 --> 29:27.098
It was Chief Chen and Chief Larkin who set up the trap.

29:27.974 --> 29:32.604
And you are the middleman who helps match up Director Chen and Team Leader Zhao,
right?

29:34.147 --> 29:36.941
That's the heart of this protein powder scandal

29:37.609 --> 29:40.695
It is also the origin of all events

29:41.905 --> 29:42.781
you hope to

29:43.406 --> 29:45.492
What do I do?

29:47.619 --> 29:50.789
Do you want me to be an inside whistleblower?

29:51.498 --> 29:52.373
I…

29:54.709 --> 29:57.670
I look down on that kind of person

29:57.754 --> 29:58.838
Team Leader Song

29:59.756 --> 30:01.591
Don't sink with the boat under your feet

30:02.550 --> 30:04.385
Let's switch to another ship as soon as possible

30:06.179 --> 30:08.264
Times have changed now

30:09.349 --> 30:11.100
It doesn't matter even if you do that

30:12.560 --> 30:16.147
"Agent Song Xuantai who helped Section Chief Chen Bingwan cover up the
crime of accepting bribes"

30:17.273 --> 30:18.858
You have to break away from this relationship

30:19.859 --> 30:22.904
Stop letting your past life determine your worth

30:23.404 --> 30:26.491
Let it be reflected in Seyong’s future

30:33.581 --> 30:36.751
You will know after reading it, currently replacing Dongxin

30:37.836 --> 30:43.341
The raw materials are provided by PF Factory,
a company run by a relative of team leader Zhao Zhenrui.

30:43.633 --> 30:46.553
As far as I know, President Park Ji-hoon of PF will provide

30:46.636 --> 30:52.976
Golf membership coupons and cars
are given to the head of the finance department and office manager Chen in return.

30:55.311 --> 30:58.815
Sorry for not informing you in advance

31:02.068 --> 31:05.947
Chief Kim,
do you have the membership coupon for Lucun CC?

31:06.030 --> 31:09.200
Chief Chen has membership coupons for Eastern Benister

31:09.784 --> 31:11.953
Yeochon CC’s membership coupons are worth 1.8 billion won

31:12.036 --> 31:14.205
Dongbu Benister’s membership coupons
are worth 980 million won

31:14.289 --> 31:17.292
Stop talking about irrelevant things!

31:17.375 --> 31:18.418
Drag that woman out

31:19.669 --> 31:24.674
The person who presented the membership coupon was none other than
President Park Ji-hoon of raw material manufacturer PF.

31:26.092 --> 31:28.386
And he is also
the brother-in-law of Zhao Zhenrui, the leader of the sales team.

31:28.469 --> 31:30.263
I said drag that woman out

31:30.346 --> 31:32.765
Take away that woman who is talking nonsense!

31:33.099 --> 31:34.726
Drag that woman out quickly!

31:36.477 --> 31:38.229
Didn't you hear what I said?

31:38.813 --> 31:40.732
You like more than just golf

31:41.316 --> 31:44.861
You also like cars and luxury resorts

31:44.944 --> 31:46.821
-enough
- cash of course

31:46.905 --> 31:48.281
Shut up!

31:58.625 --> 31:59.500
vice president

32:00.043 --> 32:02.754
I have dedicated my whole life to Shirong

32:03.463 --> 32:04.631
You should know very well

32:08.301 --> 32:09.344
Don't you know?

32:10.720 --> 32:13.056
I gave it my all!

32:27.570 --> 32:28.529
Is it just me?

32:31.616 --> 32:32.700
No

32:34.577 --> 32:35.620
no

33:03.147 --> 33:04.399
Inspection team

33:05.775 --> 33:08.069
-Please investigate this matter thoroughly
-Yes

33:14.492 --> 33:18.037
Is there anything you two want to say?

33:20.957 --> 33:23.084
I don't

33:31.634 --> 33:32.510
I…

33:35.638 --> 33:37.598
I have never been ashamed of Shi Rong

33:39.142 --> 33:41.394
But that’s not because Shirong is really acting magnanimously.

33:41.894 --> 33:43.521
It's because I have no expectations for the company

33:45.815 --> 33:47.650
But this colleague next to me

33:47.734 --> 33:49.694
During the implementation of this project

33:50.695 --> 33:52.405
I really blamed myself countless times

33:53.865 --> 33:56.409
Blaming myself for not objecting more actively

33:56.993 --> 33:58.036
she is very remorseful

33:58.703 --> 34:00.329
See her like that

34:01.330 --> 34:02.790
i feel ashamed of myself

34:03.374 --> 34:06.210
I also realized that I have been doing nothing

34:06.294 --> 34:11.340
It is also part of the reason why Shirong culture
is so outdated and unreasonable.

34:11.966 --> 34:14.135
So I plan to change starting with me

34:15.595 --> 34:16.846
I decided to look forward to it

34:18.473 --> 34:20.141
That's all I want to say

35:03.059 --> 35:04.018
you first

35:15.238 --> 35:17.490
You told me the problem was

35:18.116 --> 35:19.867
Serong’s corporate culture, right?

35:21.285 --> 35:22.203
right

35:24.288 --> 35:27.416
Can that change overnight?

35:27.500 --> 35:29.418
Although not that fast

35:30.128 --> 35:32.171
But it seems to have begun to change

35:33.214 --> 35:34.423
Yeah?

35:36.926 --> 35:38.803
About internal culture improvement plan

35:39.720 --> 35:41.097
you have to take responsibility

35:41.639 --> 35:43.224
Complete the plan well

35:48.020 --> 35:48.938
yes

35:50.231 --> 35:51.232
Thanks a lot

36:06.581 --> 36:09.250
You were so handsome just now

36:12.295 --> 36:13.963
It's because you are handsome

36:15.840 --> 36:16.966
all because of you

36:17.675 --> 36:20.845
It's all thanks to you that I had that thought

36:20.928 --> 36:23.431
Really, please take that line back

36:23.764 --> 36:24.891
I'm getting goosebumps

36:26.767 --> 36:30.188
By the way, that golf course membership ticket?

36:30.730 --> 36:32.023
How did Director Goo know?

36:32.106 --> 36:33.649
She even knows the price clearly

36:34.650 --> 36:36.736
There must be someone inside helping her

36:39.488 --> 36:41.157
Could it be Team Leader Song?

36:42.533 --> 36:43.367
impossible

36:44.160 --> 36:45.161
not him

36:46.329 --> 36:47.246
Could it be him?

36:47.788 --> 36:51.584
Didn't the vice president just order
a thorough investigation?

36:51.959 --> 36:54.462
If Team Leader Song does something wrong,
he will definitely be found out.

36:55.213 --> 36:57.006
Yes, you are right

36:57.840 --> 36:59.133
You should have a drink today

37:00.092 --> 37:01.052
I have an appointment

37:06.474 --> 37:08.768
Are you planning to officially start a relationship?

37:09.393 --> 37:11.270
Yes, probably

37:13.689 --> 37:14.732
Do you like…

37:16.192 --> 37:17.026
That person?

37:17.735 --> 37:18.736
right

37:19.362 --> 37:21.530
I like him, he is a good man

37:21.822 --> 37:22.823
That's enough

37:29.455 --> 37:32.208
You ask me how to tell whether it is friendship
or love?

37:32.333 --> 37:35.253
Because even if you are a friend
, you might like her very much.

37:35.336 --> 37:37.630
Aren't you confused with love?

37:37.713 --> 37:39.590
Are you stupid? How could there be confusion?

37:42.593 --> 37:43.469
is that so?

37:43.552 --> 37:47.390
Otherwise, try to think about whether
you would want to kiss or sleep with her.

37:48.307 --> 37:50.059
Let’s see if you can do it or not

37:50.977 --> 37:52.103
Then there's the answer

37:57.566 --> 37:59.360
What's wrong? who is it?

38:01.153 --> 38:03.197
Among the friends you know...

38:06.450 --> 38:07.535
No way?

38:08.202 --> 38:09.036
What?

38:11.539 --> 38:12.540
Could it be...

38:14.125 --> 38:15.042
Reporter Choi, right?

38:15.626 --> 38:18.004
Damn, things get complicated.

38:19.088 --> 38:19.922
you…

38:21.048 --> 38:22.216
Huiying confessed to you

38:23.217 --> 38:25.303
-What?
-She's exactly your type, right?

38:26.971 --> 38:28.889
Hey, get out of here after drinking the wine

38:28.973 --> 38:30.099
I really can't stand you

38:34.228 --> 38:36.022
If not Reporter Choi, then who?

38:39.400 --> 38:40.276
Actually it is...

38:43.237 --> 38:44.238
you

38:45.406 --> 38:46.574
Neuropathy

38:53.331 --> 38:54.582
you crazy

38:55.666 --> 38:56.667
Is it Yun Zhao?

39:06.218 --> 39:08.554
The meat is super soft and almost melts in your mouth

39:09.347 --> 39:10.598
Not to that point yet

39:10.681 --> 39:13.225
Don't pick on my bad language, I'm just saying the meat is delicious

39:13.809 --> 39:14.894
good

39:14.977 --> 39:16.771
This meal is mine

39:16.854 --> 39:18.647
Representative, enjoy it.

39:19.023 --> 39:20.691
I treat you because I want to thank you

39:23.152 --> 39:26.113
But can you please stop calling me representative?

39:26.405 --> 39:27.740
This title is too standard

39:28.324 --> 39:30.409
How about calling you "honey"?

39:34.205 --> 39:35.539
I'm just kidding

39:35.998 --> 39:37.333
It's too exaggerated to call it that.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.336
What about "baby"?

39:41.379 --> 39:42.505
What?

39:42.588 --> 39:46.300
How can we call you that when we have no relationship ?

39:47.009 --> 39:47.843
Didn't we have a relationship?

39:51.347 --> 39:52.890
Have we dated?

39:54.600 --> 39:55.893
When did it start?

39:57.353 --> 40:01.732
Then let’s start dating from today.
Today is the first day.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.910
Isn't it time yet?

40:13.619 --> 40:15.371
Do you need a little more time?

40:16.330 --> 40:17.665
But I can't seem to wait any longer

40:19.583 --> 40:21.460
Am I being a bit selfish?

40:24.463 --> 40:25.798
Is that your answer?

40:26.757 --> 40:29.343
This answer is a bit unsettling

40:30.428 --> 40:33.222
Does this mean I need to have a good cry when I get home?

40:39.812 --> 40:40.813
So

40:43.023 --> 40:44.275
Today is the first day of our relationship

40:45.985 --> 40:47.194
Are you negotiating?

40:48.487 --> 40:50.156
You can also refuse

40:51.490 --> 40:52.450
All right

40:53.117 --> 40:55.161
After all, it feels like I like you more

40:55.828 --> 40:56.704
make a deal

41:15.723 --> 41:16.974
- over there
- okay

41:19.810 --> 41:21.812
(American Chinatown snacks)

41:28.819 --> 41:29.653
-Right?
-right

41:43.083 --> 41:43.959
That’s right…

41:52.092 --> 41:53.844
- they were a little panicked
- um

42:06.815 --> 42:08.025
You want me to apologize publicly?

42:08.692 --> 42:09.610
right

42:09.693 --> 42:13.531
You must bend down and apologize in person

42:14.573 --> 42:17.868
In Korea, you may
lose your job because of a hidden ad

42:18.536 --> 42:22.498
But we
are using social media to spread false news in South Korea

42:22.581 --> 42:24.833
Therefore we need a sincere apology from the company representative

42:25.167 --> 42:26.043
no problem

42:26.126 --> 42:27.044
correct

42:27.711 --> 42:30.756
You also have to talk about the internal cons

42:32.383 --> 42:35.844
Do we need to expose our company's scandals
to the public one by one?

42:35.928 --> 42:37.972
You can't just apologize

42:38.055 --> 42:40.516
You must also demonstrate
your responsible attitude as a representative

42:40.641 --> 42:43.978
So we can't hide anything anymore

42:47.189 --> 42:49.149
Then let's make a public apology.

42:50.609 --> 42:54.363
I was busy dealing with the Human Resources Committee,
so the response was slow.

42:55.906 --> 42:56.907
I'm sorry about that

42:56.991 --> 43:00.160
I knew I chose the golden axe

43:01.203 --> 43:02.413
instead of a bad ax

43:06.375 --> 43:07.334
us

43:07.918 --> 43:09.670
I sincerely apologize to you

43:12.089 --> 43:14.091
We will definitely try our best

43:14.174 --> 43:15.509
Don't let this happen again

43:17.553 --> 43:21.807
Shi Yong Hui strives to become
a company that fulfills corporate social responsibilities

43:21.974 --> 43:25.060
We apologize again

43:36.614 --> 43:39.617
I am Se Rong’s representative, Lin Zhixian

43:40.576 --> 43:41.660
first

43:41.744 --> 43:45.205
Regarding the recent controversy caused by our company’s protein powder products

43:45.789 --> 43:48.042
caused concern among the people

43:49.001 --> 43:51.170
I would like to express my deepest apologies for this

43:58.010 --> 44:01.096
We are conducting thorough internal monitoring

44:01.722 --> 44:05.934
Try to find out the exact cause
so you can take follow-up measures

44:06.018 --> 44:07.519
Based on the results of internal monitoring

44:07.895 --> 44:09.563
We found that within the company

44:09.647 --> 44:12.316
Major problems occurred during the communication process

44:12.775 --> 44:15.027
we have not reflected

44:15.611 --> 44:17.237
A routine of repeating past mistakes

44:18.447 --> 44:21.241
I think this kind of thing should never happen

44:21.909 --> 44:25.204
In addition, for the failure to thoroughly confirm in advance

44:25.996 --> 44:27.665
Product safety lapses

44:28.165 --> 44:29.708
Even if it’s just once…

44:30.042 --> 44:31.043
I went to see her

44:31.126 --> 44:32.169
No forgiveness either

44:32.252 --> 44:33.420
The woman in the picture just now

44:35.130 --> 44:37.341
To prevent similar incidents from happening again

44:37.424 --> 44:41.637
We will significantly improve the way we communicate with the outside world

44:41.887 --> 44:44.723
- Sit down for a moment
- Shi Rong played a good chess game

44:44.807 --> 44:45.933
Can it be reversed?

44:46.016 --> 44:48.727
The current public opinion of the people is lukewarm, attracting public attention

44:50.145 --> 44:51.689
So what do you want to do?

44:52.356 --> 44:54.149
I shouldn't have gone to see her

44:55.150 --> 44:58.737
After meeting her, I realized that even though I hate her

45:00.322 --> 45:01.699
But I also miss her very much

45:03.575 --> 45:05.452
I feel a little sorry for you

45:06.620 --> 45:07.830
Why do you feel sorry for me?

45:08.497 --> 45:11.792
Aren't you still angry with her?

45:12.710 --> 45:14.586
Because she left us and walked away

45:15.587 --> 45:18.298
I know exactly how you feel

45:19.341 --> 45:20.342
so

45:21.885 --> 45:24.513
When I start to miss her a little

45:25.472 --> 45:26.432
will feel guilty

45:29.268 --> 45:31.228
I didn't mean to hide it from you

45:32.479 --> 45:35.774
It's just that I don't feel comfortable lying all the time.

45:43.282 --> 45:44.283
Yu Zhen

45:45.325 --> 45:48.412
First of all, I appreciate you telling me honestly

45:48.495 --> 45:50.831
What do you think of your mother?

45:52.207 --> 45:55.169
But I hope you don't feel guilty about me

45:55.586 --> 45:59.173
Whatever feelings you have for her,
that's up to you.

45:59.256 --> 46:01.049
And I will respect you

46:01.133 --> 46:02.551
thanks for saying that

46:03.844 --> 46:05.262
Then I'll go back to the room

46:06.972 --> 46:08.182
I can do it too…

46:10.225 --> 46:11.226
Trying to see

46:13.353 --> 46:14.980
Although not sure what the outcome will be

46:24.323 --> 46:26.033
Why are you looking for me?

46:26.241 --> 46:27.284
Is there a problem?

46:28.535 --> 46:29.787
Have you heard about me?

46:29.870 --> 46:31.205
What's up?

46:32.372 --> 46:34.291
I'm getting ready to run for mayor.

46:34.583 --> 46:36.710
But I have to win the party primary first

46:38.712 --> 46:39.588
It turned out to be this

46:39.671 --> 46:41.048
Why don't you help me?

46:45.302 --> 46:48.972
What are you doing? Do you want to ask me for help now
or what?

46:49.056 --> 46:50.682
This is not a request, but a proposal

46:50.808 --> 46:52.810
Many people recommend you to me

46:53.352 --> 46:54.853
And I can't completely ignore it

46:56.605 --> 46:57.731
I see

46:59.274 --> 47:01.693
I reject your proposal

47:02.361 --> 47:03.487
I'm not happy at all

47:06.240 --> 47:07.074
Yeah?

47:07.658 --> 47:09.201
I originally wanted to see your ability

47:09.701 --> 47:12.412
Anyway, I gave you another chance

47:13.038 --> 47:14.748
You are the one who is dismissive

47:15.624 --> 47:17.584
This conclusion really fits your style

47:23.465 --> 47:26.635
Okay, I think we're done talking, so I'll leave first.

47:26.718 --> 47:28.011
Thank you for taking the time to stop by

47:29.137 --> 47:30.097
that's all?

47:30.681 --> 47:32.224
It seems you have other expectations

47:33.225 --> 47:34.643
Is it about Yu Zhen?

47:36.103 --> 47:37.980
What a shame, I have nothing to say

47:39.356 --> 47:40.649
It seems you guessed wrong

47:45.362 --> 47:47.489
If I'm not mistaken, I won't come at all

Speaking of Team Leader Song

48:28.614 --> 48:31.533
It is said that he helped cover up all of Team Leader Zhao’s illegal activities.

48:32.242 --> 48:34.286
In exchange for a death-free gold medal

48:35.662 --> 48:38.457
Think about it, his child is in Australia

48:38.874 --> 48:41.793
Then he must have gained something from Team Leader Zhao , right?

48:43.086 --> 48:45.839
-Maybe not.
-I was shocked.

48:46.840 --> 48:48.926
Why do you show up silently every time?

48:49.593 --> 48:51.136
I think Team Leader Song

48:52.638 --> 48:54.056
Maybe not that kind of person

48:55.641 --> 48:57.601
Are you crazy? Why speak for him?

48:58.769 --> 48:59.645
no

49:00.646 --> 49:03.732
I just feel that way

49:04.733 --> 49:05.609
You just…

49:06.526 --> 49:08.028
Just think about yourself

49:10.030 --> 49:11.657
No one will help you at all

49:12.157 --> 49:13.158
so

49:14.159 --> 49:15.619

acting so strong to protect himself

Is it 119?

49:33.720 --> 49:35.847
There's a guy here who's talking crazy nonsense

49:35.931 --> 49:36.765

51:23.330 --> 51:27.000
Are you here to visit, you brat?
He actually sat there and didn't help.

51:27.167 --> 51:29.294
Agent Park is left busy all by himself.

51:29.461 --> 51:32.172

51:34.132 --> 51:35.008
"That girl"?

51:37.260 --> 51:40.138
what? Is this place filled with pink bubbles too?

51:40.931 --> 51:44.768
Sure enough, it’s better to be single, you can have ambiguities everywhere

51:45.310 --> 51:48.647
Everyone, I have a boyfriend, okay?

51:50.357 --> 51:52.067
Now it's time to reveal

51:52.150 --> 51:55.362
Liu Caimin was my classmate in elementary school and junior high school.

51:59.699 --> 52:01.993
OK, I'll say it again

52:02.452 --> 52:05.872

52:10.919 --> 52:12.087
scared me

52:12.170 --> 52:15.966
If you completely fooled us,
then it's obviously no big deal.

52:16.550 --> 52:19.094
Then help arrange things quickly.
Director Gu will be here soon.

52:19.427 --> 52:21.054
OK, I'll help set it up

52:22.597 --> 52:26.852
By the way, I heard that both Chief Kim
and Chief Chen have resigned.

52:27.102 --> 52:29.521
They mentioned it before the inspection results came out.

52:29.604 --> 52:30.564
What about Team Leader Song?

52:30.647 --> 52:34.693
He seems to have been under surveillance together
, but I don’t know what the outcome will be.

52:35.443 --> 52:37.028
I'm really curious

52:37.112 --> 52:39.447

52:40.991 --> 52:42.826
