Workplace Competition Code

00:43.001 --> 00:44.627
Don’t cry in front of me again

00:44.711 --> 00:47.130
Never negotiate with tears

00:47.797 --> 00:49.257
That's the worst way

00:58.558 --> 01:00.226
I think it’s great to be loud

01:02.979 --> 01:04.272
You get off work

02:30.275 --> 02:31.359
Time is wasted

02:34.362 --> 02:37.532
If you want to curse, you can curse. Now is the time.

02:39.909 --> 02:40.952
bad woman

02:42.078 --> 02:44.038
Do you have to say it so harshly?

02:45.999 --> 02:47.542
Hey, I'm so weak

02:48.209 --> 02:49.460
Your scolding is too bland

02:50.628 --> 02:51.921
Bad stinky woman

02:52.297 --> 02:53.756
Does she think she is great?

02:54.924 --> 02:56.342
Yes, this is better

02:56.426 --> 02:58.469
How could she treat my eight years of
work experience like dirt?

02:58.553 --> 03:00.346
How can I be the same as the newcomer?

03:01.139 --> 03:02.015
Really

03:02.098 --> 03:04.309
I came in based on work experience.

03:04.934 --> 03:05.810
Right?

03:06.477 --> 03:08.771
The competition rate for special recruitment is exaggerated, right?

03:09.189 --> 03:10.064
Yeah, of course

03:12.025 --> 03:15.028
I must prove it to her

03:15.820 --> 03:18.948
I have to prove how serious I am!

03:24.537 --> 03:25.496
Then again

03:26.331 --> 03:28.041
Why do I cry so much?

03:29.417 --> 03:30.752
I always shed tears involuntarily

03:31.628 --> 03:34.422
I can't control myself when I feel wronged

03:35.965 --> 03:37.675
That makes me even more angry and upset

03:37.759 --> 03:39.594
Some people say tears and smiles are the same

03:48.895 --> 03:52.440
So don’t feel wronged just because you cry easily.

03:53.650 --> 03:56.402
You love to laugh and cry

03:56.486 --> 03:57.987
Just be true to your feelings

04:01.491 --> 04:03.201
Who told you to be so handsome?

04:03.618 --> 04:04.619
it is me

04:05.954 --> 04:06.829
Very stylish, right?

04:21.135 --> 04:22.262
("An Ordinary Day")

04:29.060 --> 04:32.188
If you dare to ruin the atmosphere, I will kill you!

Hello

05:25.616 --> 05:26.993
morning

05:42.008 --> 05:42.884
Agent Park Yun-soo

05:43.593 --> 05:44.552
Yes, team leader

05:46.721 --> 05:48.181
Agent Park, this is your PR schedule.

05:49.557 --> 05:52.685
Also, please contact the Human Resources Office
to get the PC as soon as possible

05:52.769 --> 05:54.479
If you don't push it, this matter will continue to drag on.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.022
yes

05:58.066 --> 06:00.735
(Qualifications are not limited, recruitment of experienced personnel
will be finalized, public relations schedule)

06:08.743 --> 06:09.952
Hello everyone

06:10.036 --> 06:14.165
I just joined
the Public Relations Team 3 of the Public Relations Office of the Business Strategy Headquarters.

06:14.248 --> 06:15.375
Park Yoon Joo

06:15.750 --> 06:19.253
Why did you come to apply for
Shi Yong’s special recruitment?

06:19.337 --> 06:20.713
I have ambition

06:21.339 --> 06:24.884
I want to have my own brand within a big company

06:24.967 --> 06:27.887
Many people are quite curious about your past experiences

06:27.970 --> 06:32.308
Can you share your experience
and how you started working in PR?

06:32.392 --> 06:34.685
I used to go to a technical high school

06:35.853 --> 06:38.898
After graduation, I worked in the general affairs team

06:38.981 --> 06:40.900
It took about three to four years

06:41.526 --> 06:43.486
Later I moved to a room…

06:43.569 --> 06:44.529
Hello

06:45.363 --> 06:46.239
Hello

06:46.322 --> 06:47.657
Yes, please take care of me

06:47.740 --> 06:49.492
-Is it okay to just sit here?
-right

06:49.575 --> 06:51.202
It's time to start shooting. Maintain this position and don't move.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.247
Take some more pictures

06:55.540 --> 06:56.416
Like this?

06:56.499 --> 06:58.668
Yes, good, very good now

06:59.627 --> 07:00.670
take this

07:02.713 --> 07:03.798
Smile a little wider

07:09.262 --> 07:10.638
Slowly jump to the next one

07:10.888 --> 07:12.056
-Thank you for your hard work
-No.

07:14.142 --> 07:16.644
Wait, go back to the previous one

07:17.812 --> 07:19.564
How about this one? I feel it's ok

07:19.689 --> 07:21.023
Yes, pretty good

07:22.358 --> 07:23.734
This one is very good

07:23.818 --> 07:25.945
Let’s pick this one up first and let’s continue reading.

07:26.487 --> 07:29.615
-If you like it, tell me
. -Wait a minute, the previous picture of this one

07:29.699 --> 07:30.700
-This one?
-right

07:30.783 --> 07:31.659
Nice shot

07:31.742 --> 07:32.827
You feel…

07:34.120 --> 07:35.538
how do you feel?

07:35.663 --> 07:36.956
nice

07:38.332 --> 07:39.333
very good

07:39.417 --> 07:40.418
There are too many good photos

07:40.501 --> 07:41.752
she behaved well

07:45.965 --> 07:46.841
Hello

07:47.425 --> 07:51.012
I work so hard and
you just give me a lunch?

07:51.095 --> 07:52.722
Go report it to the Ministry of Labor?

07:54.390 --> 07:55.975
I just joined the company and you want to ask me to leave?

07:56.058 --> 07:58.478
Of course we can't fire you so quickly

07:59.103 --> 08:00.146
Don't be too afraid

08:04.650 --> 08:08.446
It's a bit exaggerated to cause trouble over this bento.

08:12.783 --> 08:14.118
It’s my favorite bento

08:15.119 --> 08:15.953
So what do you eat?

08:17.788 --> 08:18.915
You also know that I don't like eels

08:18.998 --> 08:20.583
The eel looks disgusting

08:29.634 --> 08:31.260
Keep up the good work when you’re full, Yun Zhao

08:31.844 --> 08:33.137
We still have to be busy later

08:33.721 --> 08:35.515
I am also in public relations, I know very well

08:41.687 --> 08:42.980
Remember to say something if it goes too far

08:44.857 --> 08:46.150
So what if I say it?

08:46.817 --> 08:49.028
I hope you will at least say it

08:49.111 --> 08:52.281
The same goes for everyone going to see a psychiatrist.

08:52.907 --> 08:54.784
It's important to express it

Hello

09:20.851 --> 09:21.727
Reporter Park

09:22.311 --> 09:23.479
Please give me some advice

09:35.783 --> 09:36.867
Sit down

09:37.868 --> 09:38.828
OK

09:40.663 --> 09:42.248
You have to be as formal as you are at work, right?

09:43.124 --> 09:44.250
Yes, we are working

09:47.044 --> 09:48.087
Pour us a cup of tea

09:48.170 --> 09:49.005
yes

09:55.011 --> 09:56.220
Are you still used to staying in hotels?

09:56.304 --> 09:58.180
This one is okay

09:58.889 --> 10:02.143
Then you can continue to live here
so that I can have friends who live nearby.

10:05.521 --> 10:07.648
we are not friends

10:08.691 --> 10:09.900
It's been a while

10:10.776 --> 10:11.652
Really high maintenance

10:14.238 --> 10:15.114
so

10:15.906 --> 10:17.325
Have you met Ahn Eun-seok?

10:21.746 --> 10:23.456
You haven't met yet?

10:24.707 --> 10:25.916
I have no reason to see him

10:26.542 --> 10:29.253
That's right, why would you go to your ex-husband if you have nothing to do?

10:30.504 --> 10:31.922
You have a daughter, right?

10:32.590 --> 10:35.426
Have you met your daughter? How old is she?
I remember it was written in your profile

10:36.177 --> 10:37.386
represent

10:38.763 --> 10:41.641
I hired you because I wanted someone to chat with me.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.476
Is that my responsibility? Yeah?

10:45.102 --> 10:46.479
Message from the Vice President

10:47.229 --> 10:48.064
You should think so

10:50.232 --> 10:52.693
She is an ESG professional consultant

10:52.777 --> 10:54.528
(ESG: refers to environmental protection,
social responsibility and corporate governance)

10:54.612 --> 10:56.238
(Non-financial standards for business operations)

10:58.783 --> 10:59.659
(ESG expert, Koo Yi-jung)

10:59.742 --> 11:00.910
ESG？

11:02.203 --> 11:05.748
It should be considered as if she hired a consultant.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.210
Representation is indeed a lonely position

11:09.919 --> 11:11.629
It's good to have someone to talk to.

11:11.712 --> 11:12.922
yes

11:15.299 --> 11:17.677
Vice president, you should make preparations now

11:18.469 --> 11:20.262
-Then let's go
-Yes

11:24.225 --> 11:26.227
You're the only male, so sit in the middle

11:26.394 --> 11:27.728
Come, this way please

11:29.105 --> 11:29.980
Please take a seat…

11:34.694 --> 11:35.528
hateful

11:36.112 --> 11:38.364
- Jae Min, let me check the list of reporters
- Okay

11:39.865 --> 11:41.409
-Have you contacted everyone?
-yes

11:41.492 --> 11:43.786
Only Y News didn’t answer the phone

11:43.869 --> 11:46.163
Really, why haven't they come yet?

11:51.669 --> 11:52.712
Hello

11:53.421 --> 11:54.296
smile

12:28.247 --> 12:29.707
This is the leader of the second public relations team

12:30.291 --> 12:31.167
I am Song Xuantai

12:31.250 --> 12:32.293
That one is the head of the public relations team

12:56.609 --> 12:57.985
Hey, Jae Min

13:04.575 --> 13:06.702
He is the planner of this project with no restrictions on qualifications

13:06.786 --> 13:07.995
and business undertaker

13:11.916 --> 13:14.001
I’m Yoo Jae-min from the Public Relations Team 2

13:21.008 --> 13:24.386
You also seem to think that this kind of activity helps promote

13:25.596 --> 13:27.389
This requires a lot of effort

13:28.724 --> 13:30.559
but not much effect

13:32.186 --> 13:34.104
This is done to improve Se Yong’s image

13:34.772 --> 13:36.649
-Is it right?
-Yes

13:36.941 --> 13:40.277
This kind of superficial and short-lived activity

13:42.279 --> 13:44.114
Already a bit outdated

13:45.199 --> 13:47.284
Then please let the event continue

13:49.578 --> 13:53.332
The Republic of Korea holds a Fair Recruitment Fair every year hosted by
the Ministry

13:53.415 --> 13:55.751
and blind hiring excellence case competition

13:56.335 --> 13:58.420
Although most of them are registered for government agencies,

13:59.296 --> 14:04.593
However, it can be seen that
the social demand for fair recruitment based on work ability

14:05.302 --> 14:06.595
is big

14:06.679 --> 14:08.305
-Per year?
-Yes

14:08.389 --> 14:09.765
What if it can continue?

14:17.231 --> 14:19.066
- that's a good thing of course
- no

14:19.733 --> 14:21.652
-This is not the answer I want
-Director Goo

14:22.111 --> 14:24.488
The minister is now with the vice president

14:24.572 --> 14:25.823
Do you want to go over and have a look?

14:27.241 --> 14:28.409
OK, let's go

14:28.492 --> 14:29.827
Yes, this way please

14:29.910 --> 14:30.911
walk slowly

14:42.756 --> 14:43.591
Are you reading nonsense?

14:43.674 --> 14:44.508
right

14:44.842 --> 14:46.176
There hasn’t been much discussion recently

14:46.760 --> 14:48.178
very quiet

14:48.596 --> 14:51.682
Seriously, I don't think there's any need to check over there.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.143
Do we even have to regulate nonsense?

14:57.229 --> 14:59.940
Then go and go somewhere else

15:01.859 --> 15:03.068
Okay, that's what I'm going to do

15:04.153 --> 15:06.322
When I become an agent, I want to go to the sales team

15:06.530 --> 15:08.157
Staying in the PR team is not conducive to promotion

15:08.240 --> 15:10.326
Look at you, you are so ambitious

15:13.203 --> 15:14.413
Don't always meet your sister

15:15.831 --> 15:17.499
You won’t get back together

15:17.583 --> 15:19.084
She has another partner

15:19.168 --> 15:20.961
I was called over by her

15:21.045 --> 15:22.630
How is that? So irresponsible

15:23.213 --> 15:25.007
It is irresponsible for her to seek me out

15:25.591 --> 15:26.508
Go find your senior to investigate

15:26.592 --> 15:28.677
She's drunk, don't go to her

15:28.761 --> 15:30.012
You should take the initiative to reject her

15:30.095 --> 15:31.180
Why?

15:31.847 --> 15:32.890
I'm lonely too

15:36.477 --> 15:38.354
I shouldn't have introduced them

15:39.313 --> 15:40.230
Can't stand it

15:44.485 --> 15:45.444
We have a dinner party today

15:53.410 --> 15:54.286
How is this?

15:54.870 --> 15:56.413
I can't tell whether you are happy or not

15:57.539 --> 15:58.582
nice

15:59.416 --> 16:01.627
It is to commemorate the inauguration
ceremony of personnel regardless of qualifications.

16:01.710 --> 16:03.921
The room chief gave instructions in the hope that all groups can unite

16:04.505 --> 16:06.924
Inaugural ceremony for persons with no qualifications
and the unity of our group…

16:09.009 --> 16:10.302
There is a huge correlation!

16:11.679 --> 16:13.222
Let's get ready for a dinner party, everyone

16:14.264 --> 16:15.516
Which restaurant should I book?

16:16.600 --> 16:17.601
He didn't even answer

16:18.727 --> 16:19.812
Three groups

16:20.729 --> 16:21.647
Three groups

16:22.690 --> 16:24.692
Who can come to the party today?

16:30.864 --> 16:32.241
What about the rest?

16:33.492 --> 16:36.537
I already have an appointment

16:36.620 --> 16:40.582
My mother is feeling unwell and has an appointment to see a doctor today.

16:44.503 --> 16:45.796
Where is Agent Xu?

16:46.964 --> 16:48.716
I can go

16:49.550 --> 16:51.510
You'd better go home today

16:52.261 --> 16:54.680
Go back and take a nap and then take a shower

16:54.763 --> 16:55.639
good

16:56.807 --> 16:59.560
Then our group will have a dinner party at noon tomorrow instead.

17:01.228 --> 17:02.396
OK

17:11.822 --> 17:13.115
She is a young lady with no qualifications

17:14.074 --> 17:16.118
I am Section Chief Meng Zhejun

17:16.535 --> 17:17.411
right

17:17.703 --> 17:19.413
Thanks to you, we are going to have a dinner

17:20.247 --> 17:21.165
goodbye

17:22.499 --> 17:23.333
Hello

17:35.763 --> 17:37.097
Aren't you three groups going to have dinner together?

17:37.181 --> 17:39.391
We will have a lunch party tomorrow instead

17:39.933 --> 17:40.768
Why?

17:41.602 --> 17:44.521
One person said that he wanted to accompany his mother to see a doctor.
This must be a lie.

17:45.064 --> 17:48.025
The other person was asked to go home to rest and wash up.

17:48.108 --> 17:50.194
Obviously this is to welcome you into the company, really

17:50.861 --> 17:51.737
What?

17:52.738 --> 17:54.907
So do you want to have dinner with our group?

17:56.033 --> 17:57.284
Is this okay?

17:57.534 --> 17:58.577
Can not be done

17:58.660 --> 17:59.787
Damn it, then what are you asking?

18:00.370 --> 18:01.246
Hello

18:01.789 --> 18:04.041
Do you want to drink with Team Leader Song? serious?

18:04.374 --> 18:05.209
In no mood

18:06.168 --> 18:07.711
I didn't consider that

18:08.879 --> 18:09.838
it's a pity

18:09.922 --> 18:12.925
You are the only wage earner I know who
likes to have dinner together.

18:13.884 --> 18:15.594
Li Sejiang also likes it

18:16.470 --> 18:17.638
Cao Ya public relations…

18:17.721 --> 18:20.140
Then you have worked hard today too

18:21.100 --> 18:22.017
See you next time

18:25.854 --> 18:28.732
Yes, Agent Jaemin, you have worked hard too

18:30.359 --> 18:31.485
move

18:31.568 --> 18:32.444
The section chief too

18:33.612 --> 18:34.863
Go quickly

18:36.240 --> 18:37.282
Meng…

18:37.866 --> 18:39.243
(Representative Kim Hee-young)

18:39.326 --> 18:41.495
Do you have an appointment tonight?

18:45.666 --> 18:47.626
So what to eat?

18:47.709 --> 18:49.336
- You can eat whatever you want.
- Find any place.

18:49.419 --> 18:50.546
Then let's go eat grilled pork belly

18:50.629 --> 18:52.131
-Roasted pork? The opposite one?
-right

18:52.214 --> 18:53.215
Yes, the one opposite

18:53.298 --> 18:55.425
- Let's go
. It's cheap and delicious there.

18:59.346 --> 19:00.889
Yes, we have an appointment

19:03.642 --> 19:05.894
Xiao En, do you want to eat pig's feet?

19:08.856 --> 19:10.107
Add some disc soba noodles

19:26.790 --> 19:28.667
Then why do you have to go to work?

19:29.126 --> 19:31.378
Just to make money?

19:31.461 --> 19:34.214
I hope my abilities are also appreciated

19:34.298 --> 19:36.842
So I'll be a senior executive

19:37.926 --> 19:39.219
Is she self-actualizing?

19:39.303 --> 19:40.888
Or schizophrenia?

19:40.971 --> 19:42.097
how?

19:43.182 --> 19:44.558
Don’t you understand Shi Rong yet?

19:44.641 --> 19:46.852
Only 1% of employees become senior executives

19:46.935 --> 19:49.980
The chances are slim, almost impossible

19:50.063 --> 19:51.440
But just you as a girl?

19:52.441 --> 19:53.859
The representative is also a girl.

19:54.151 --> 19:55.986
The business belongs to their family,
regardless of gender.

19:56.069 --> 19:57.446
wrong

19:57.529 --> 20:00.157
If Representative Lin were a man, he would have inherited the company long ago.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.074
How could he be the head of the strategy department?

20:01.700 --> 20:04.119
Yes, Seyong is that kind of place

20:04.203 --> 20:05.537
I still have to do gymnastics at the company

20:05.621 --> 20:06.747
Shi Rong is gradually changing

20:06.830 --> 20:09.416
This time the new chief public relations officer is also a girl.

20:09.499 --> 20:12.169
She is someone else found on behalf of others.

20:12.628 --> 20:15.631
There has never been a woman starting from the grassroots in Shirong

20:15.714 --> 20:17.883
An example of finally becoming a senior executive

20:17.966 --> 20:20.260
I'm going to set a precedent!

20:20.344 --> 20:22.763
As long as you drink, you can talk to me no matter how big or small you are.

20:24.014 --> 20:25.182
What are you doing

20:26.600 --> 20:27.434
watch video?

20:28.769 --> 20:30.896
Social climate is really changing

20:31.438 --> 20:33.440
Watching a movie by yourself during a dinner party?

20:33.523 --> 20:35.901
It's so boring, you guys keep talking about
the same topics over and over again

20:37.736 --> 20:38.737
good

20:38.820 --> 20:42.115
Since we're bored now,
let's repeat the same itinerary and go to the second stall.

20:42.199 --> 20:43.951
-Give it back to me
-Don't make trouble

20:44.034 --> 20:45.035
You all want to go to the second stall, right?

20:45.452 --> 20:46.954
-Then I'm looking for Team Leader Chi.
-What?

20:48.080 --> 20:49.414
-Team leader?
-yes

20:51.875 --> 20:52.834
That's right

20:56.630 --> 20:59.049
It seems that the room manager did not invite Team Leader Chi

20:59.466 --> 21:01.134
Team Leader Song and Team Leader Cui are both there, right?

21:01.218 --> 21:04.096
They should go to a high-end bar,
and of course they can't ask out Team Leader Chi.

21:11.228 --> 21:13.438
By the way, is the dinner party between the three groups over?

21:14.731 --> 21:16.191
They want to have a lunch party tomorrow instead

21:16.275 --> 21:17.109
Really?

21:18.443 --> 21:20.529
It's different because the team members are younger

21:21.029 --> 21:22.030
Not a typical dinner party

21:22.531 --> 21:23.657
that's what i want

21:24.449 --> 21:26.827
Brother, please transfer me to the third group

21:27.327 --> 21:28.620
Let me transfer there first

21:31.540 --> 21:32.582
By the way, Jae Min

21:33.542 --> 21:36.545
My innate sixth sense tells me

21:36.962 --> 21:39.631
Will you date that young lady who has no qualifications?

21:43.510 --> 21:44.803
How about it? Am I too sharp?

21:44.886 --> 21:46.471
No, what is he interested in?

21:47.306 --> 21:48.765
Cai Min’s vision is not high

21:49.099 --> 21:50.600
She is within the qualification range

21:51.268 --> 21:52.519
She looks quite cute

21:52.602 --> 21:54.896
Agent Kim, you shouldn't comment on other people's appearance.

21:54.980 --> 21:58.650
Would you be happy if someone said you looked like a gangster ?

22:04.948 --> 22:05.907
Hey, do I look like a gangster?

22:05.991 --> 22:07.367
you just look ugly

22:08.327 --> 22:10.203
So who is your ideal lover?

22:10.287 --> 22:13.081
Angelina Jolie in "Smith vs. Smith's Wife"

22:13.165 --> 22:14.416
Stop it

22:16.335 --> 22:18.253
Anyway, don’t make reservations for me if you want to renew your stall.

22:19.129 --> 22:21.923
If you want to renew your stall, please use this card.
Team Leader Song just gave it to me.

22:26.219 --> 22:28.513
Okay, let's go, go quickly...

22:28.597 --> 22:30.182
- It's really dirty.
- Take it.

22:30.265 --> 22:31.808
Please, I've taken a shower

22:31.892 --> 22:33.518
Come on, let's have one last drink and then go.

22:33.602 --> 22:34.936
(PS Bank, Corporate Card, Shirong)

22:43.278 --> 22:44.738
welcome

22:53.914 --> 22:54.790
I say you

22:55.374 --> 22:58.418
Do you know how many years we haven’t seen each other?

22:59.002 --> 23:01.421
You pretend a little bit that you're happy to see me

23:01.505 --> 23:03.965
-is it hard?
-i'm happy to see you

23:09.096 --> 23:10.347
Came here again…

23:12.599 --> 23:15.143
It's also very happy, it's still the same.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.145
Time seems to have paused here

23:17.687 --> 23:20.524
We all drank like crazy here when we first became journalists.

23:20.607 --> 23:21.733
Do you remember?

23:22.984 --> 23:26.655
Really, you want to invite me to drink with you?

23:27.406 --> 23:28.949
It feels good to drink it by yourself

23:30.867 --> 23:31.701
Hello

23:32.661 --> 23:34.704
In that case, why did you come to me?

23:35.122 --> 23:37.207
Just drink it yourself, right?

23:38.583 --> 23:39.418
how is your day?

23:41.169 --> 23:42.170
not good

23:44.756 --> 23:46.383
I've been through all kinds of storms

23:46.466 --> 23:48.718
Had a very hard time

23:52.514 --> 23:54.182
Then why did you come back suddenly?

23:54.808 --> 23:56.143
I thought you wouldn't come back

23:56.226 --> 23:57.436
This one

24:00.188 --> 24:01.356
I may be a little tired

24:02.315 --> 24:05.193
No matter what achievements are made there

24:06.278 --> 24:08.822
I'm just a stranger

24:09.739 --> 24:10.782
There's a feeling of not being able to fit in

24:13.910 --> 24:15.871
It turns out you came back to recharge your batteries

24:17.330 --> 24:19.499
I understand what you mean

24:20.709 --> 24:22.294
But why is it Se Rong?

24:22.377 --> 24:24.796
You probably can’t stand it very much, right?

24:25.589 --> 24:26.423
Yeah?

24:28.550 --> 24:29.426
forget it

24:29.968 --> 24:34.306
It's really a good place to spend time

24:36.558 --> 24:38.310
Anyway, I'm glad to meet you.

24:38.393 --> 24:39.519
Oh my god

24:40.312 --> 24:43.982
It’s really a great honor for Goo Yi Jung to come to me.

24:44.065 --> 24:46.401
I don’t have many friends that I’m in contact with either.

24:46.485 --> 24:47.360
Really?

24:47.444 --> 24:49.613
That should be an honor for you

24:49.696 --> 24:50.906
Come on, cheers

24:50.989 --> 24:52.199
- I'm honored
- OK

24:54.659 --> 24:56.745
Let’s start with warm-up exercises

24:56.828 --> 24:58.830
Raise your knees past 90 degrees

24:58.914 --> 25:01.082
Hands slapping the knees alternately

25:01.374 --> 25:02.876
Don't move too fast

25:08.381 --> 25:10.926
-What are you doing?
-I ate too much and couldn't breathe

25:11.009 --> 25:11.968
Feel like vomiting

25:19.851 --> 25:20.769
Would that be better?

25:20.852 --> 25:23.188
Don't talk to me, I'll really spit it out

25:23.647 --> 25:24.731
Hey, shut your mouth

25:24.856 --> 25:26.483
There seemed to be something at the corner of your mouth just now

25:33.198 --> 25:34.115
I'll smoke one

25:35.408 --> 25:36.576
Um?

25:36.660 --> 25:38.537
Something's not right with Yoo Jae-min

25:40.330 --> 25:41.373
Hello

25:41.957 --> 25:44.417
It's almost time. Go and smoke one.

25:44.501 --> 25:45.669
- Go quickly
- I don’t want to smoke

25:45.752 --> 25:46.670
go ahead

25:49.130 --> 25:50.966
- Really
- Put your hands on your waist

25:51.049 --> 25:52.467
Spread your feet shoulder-width apart

26:09.943 --> 26:10.944
Hello

26:11.861 --> 26:13.280
Didn’t you quit smoking?

26:14.030 --> 26:15.365
Originally it was

26:17.659 --> 26:19.494
What's wrong? Are you worried?

26:24.332 --> 26:25.250
Hard to say

26:26.418 --> 26:27.252
how?

26:27.919 --> 26:28.878
Don't you want to say it?

26:31.506 --> 26:32.716
No, I don't want to say it

26:33.800 --> 26:34.718
That's it anyway

26:40.557 --> 26:41.558
Really

26:42.017 --> 26:44.019
Hey, you are really acting out today

26:47.772 --> 26:49.649
what happened?

26:50.400 --> 26:53.862
Why did you suddenly start smoking?

26:53.945 --> 26:57.490
Do you think of your old lover?

26:57.574 --> 26:59.159
What kind of cliche is that?

26:59.242 --> 27:00.076
Um

27:03.038 --> 27:04.581
What? Really?

27:05.540 --> 27:08.209
Who was your old flame?

27:09.961 --> 27:13.131
-Why should I tell you?
-Because we're playing the truth game

27:14.633 --> 27:16.176
What? So sudden?

27:16.259 --> 27:19.763
Yes, this kind of game
is fun only when you are caught off guard.

27:19.846 --> 27:22.682
-Right?
-Yeah, it just needs to be unexpected.

27:25.602 --> 27:26.770
Where did we first meet?

27:27.103 --> 27:28.188
San Diego

27:29.314 --> 27:31.274
what? When did you go to San Diego?

27:31.358 --> 27:32.275
Is this a problem?

27:32.359 --> 27:33.652
Is this the answer?

27:34.653 --> 27:36.488
I went there after I was discharged from the army. Next question

27:36.571 --> 27:37.906
how did you guys meet?

27:38.865 --> 27:41.034
We met by chance while walking on the street

27:41.868 --> 27:43.036
Be more detailed

27:44.537 --> 27:45.622
It was raining that day

27:46.206 --> 27:47.582
We stayed in the same hotel

27:49.334 --> 27:50.627
then fall in love

27:53.213 --> 27:55.799
I heard you were joking. Are you lying?

27:55.882 --> 27:58.176
Yes, he is lying, this must be fake

27:58.760 --> 28:00.887
Hey, why am I the only one playing the truth game?

28:01.137 --> 28:02.889
There's nothing to ask.
We know everything about each other, right?

28:02.972 --> 28:04.474
Of course we have no secrets

28:04.557 --> 28:07.185
-Every relationship of hers is short-lived
. You don't have to give in too much.

28:07.268 --> 28:08.812
At least longer than you

28:10.355 --> 28:13.191
Whoever likes you, date them and
then get rid of them first

28:13.274 --> 28:16.111
If my feelings for them don't deepen,
then I should break up.

28:18.029 --> 28:20.907
When you agreed to date, did you really like the other person?

28:21.032 --> 28:22.701
Probably to the extent that I have a good impression of him

28:23.785 --> 28:25.995
It’s also magical to stop at a good feeling

28:26.621 --> 28:28.248
Yes, how could this happen?

28:28.331 --> 28:29.582
I really hope someone can teach me

28:29.666 --> 28:31.793
Because you only date trash

28:31.876 --> 28:32.711
Hello

28:34.087 --> 28:35.547
Don't you know

28:36.589 --> 28:38.633
What does it feel like to love someone?

28:40.218 --> 28:42.345
Do you know it well?

28:43.138 --> 28:45.098
Of course, I understand very well

28:45.682 --> 28:46.516
What does that feel like?

28:51.521 --> 28:52.522
like this

28:53.690 --> 28:55.316
You can feel it just by looking at it

28:58.820 --> 29:00.488
Just by looking at each other, you can understand everything

29:03.116 --> 29:04.242
Needless to say

29:20.884 --> 29:21.968
Do you have someone you like?

29:24.804 --> 29:25.764
Is it me?

29:44.073 --> 29:45.283
If so

29:46.701 --> 29:47.660
What do you want?

30:15.438 --> 30:19.359
Hey, look at his expression, he
looks like he is about to perish.

30:20.068 --> 30:22.987
Wait, it’s very unpleasant to think about it.

30:23.363 --> 30:27.826
Hey, sister, I like you,
shouldn’t you be grateful?

30:27.909 --> 30:30.453
Yes, I'm very grateful

30:30.537 --> 30:33.540
It's so hot here, I feel like my heart is going to jump out

30:34.040 --> 30:35.250
Really

30:36.042 --> 30:37.043
So talented

30:38.294 --> 30:39.462
What do you think about me?

30:39.546 --> 30:40.964
Do you want to date me?

30:42.674 --> 30:43.716
No, sister

30:44.217 --> 30:46.719
Do you mind if I refuse?

30:48.137 --> 30:51.724
Why did you reject me?
Can you tell me why?

30:51.808 --> 30:53.434
You two are really sick

30:54.018 --> 30:55.019
because of you

30:55.895 --> 30:58.690
It's really not my type

31:00.817 --> 31:01.693
I gotta go

31:02.777 --> 31:03.778
Can I go?

31:07.824 --> 31:11.327
Can I ask you another question?

31:11.786 --> 31:14.080
what is the problem? If you want to ask, ask quickly, I'm really tired

31:15.206 --> 31:17.166
You have never been in love

31:17.584 --> 31:18.543
Could it be

31:19.586 --> 31:20.712
Is it because of her?

31:43.067 --> 31:44.152
I am leaving

31:54.829 --> 31:57.040
Hey, please understand the situation

31:58.041 --> 32:00.126
What do you think that means?

32:00.209 --> 32:01.169
Did he acquiesce?

32:02.295 --> 32:03.212
whatever

32:07.383 --> 32:08.217
you…

32:08.301 --> 32:10.470
Either you speak clearly

32:10.553 --> 32:12.597
Otherwise, let it go decisively

32:12.680 --> 32:13.932
It’s been decades

32:14.015 --> 32:15.099
Crazy woman, oh my god

32:15.183 --> 32:18.645
Hey, it's not like that, it's really not

32:18.728 --> 32:20.480
If I still have feelings for him

32:20.563 --> 32:24.525
I just heard him say that I'm not his type.
I should have felt like a bolt from the blue.

32:24.609 --> 32:25.944
There are already tears in your eyes

32:26.569 --> 32:27.820
Damn it, I just said no

32:28.738 --> 32:29.906
I gotta go

32:40.875 --> 32:42.585
-Hey
-so what?

32:42.669 --> 32:44.045
You just have to let go decisively

34:32.820 --> 34:34.155
(Yu Zhen, mother has returned to Korea)

34:34.238 --> 34:36.783
(You didn’t answer the phone, so I sent you a message)

34:36.866 --> 34:39.118
(Be sure to call me when you have time)

35:03.309 --> 35:04.685
Today was tough

35:04.769 --> 35:05.686
Won't

35:06.270 --> 35:07.438
Let's go

35:12.944 --> 35:15.071
Why are you here? I heard that you are very busy recently

35:15.696 --> 35:17.115
Yes, I am indeed busy

35:17.698 --> 35:21.702
Although I am very busy, this is the only
time I can chat with my daughter

35:29.460 --> 35:31.212
Are you free right now?

35:34.382 --> 35:36.425
What's wrong? Why do you look unhappy?

35:37.802 --> 35:39.011
What happened?

35:39.095 --> 35:40.847
No, it's spam

35:41.430 --> 35:43.808
It's really annoying and annoying

35:44.433 --> 35:45.560
sounds like lunch meat

35:46.894 --> 35:49.438
How about we have ham for dinner?

35:50.773 --> 35:51.816
No, I want to eat fish

35:54.110 --> 35:55.236
mackerel

35:55.820 --> 35:57.780
Yu Zhen, do you know that mackerel is difficult to predict?

35:58.656 --> 35:59.615
Why?

35:59.699 --> 36:01.868
Because there is a song with the lyrics "It's unpredictable whether it's sunny or rainy"

36:05.079 --> 36:06.831
You told cold jokes again

36:09.125 --> 36:12.211
What's wrong? Why does your expression look like this?
Did anyone bully you?

36:15.798 --> 36:18.050
(Se Yong)

36:20.428 --> 36:22.013
morning

36:22.096 --> 36:23.306
morning

36:25.224 --> 36:26.309
(Shi Rong, qualifications are not limited!)

36:27.101 --> 36:27.977
Hello everyone

36:28.060 --> 36:31.939
I'm from the Public Relations Team 3 of the Public Relations Office of the Business Strategy Headquarters.

36:32.023 --> 36:32.857
Park Yoon Joo

36:36.152 --> 36:38.571
I used to work in a PR agency

36:38.654 --> 36:40.823
When I heard Se Yong

36:40.907 --> 36:45.411
For the first time, we should
recruit employees solely based on their resumes.

36:45.494 --> 36:49.207
I thought I couldn't miss the opportunity, so I applied.

37:00.176 --> 37:02.887
After I graduated, I worked in the general affairs team

37:03.512 --> 37:05.389
It took about three to four years

37:05.890 --> 37:09.268
Later, I switched to a company that produces corporate newspapers and periodicals.

37:09.810 --> 37:11.562
I was originally from the general affairs team

37:11.646 --> 37:14.649
But there was a shortage of manpower at the time, so I started writing reports

37:14.732 --> 37:17.485
That’s when I started to get involved in the public relations industry

37:20.696 --> 37:22.823
(Qualifications are not limited, recruitment of experienced personnel
will be finalized, public relations schedule)

37:22.907 --> 37:24.450
(Public relations office, represented by Park Yun-soo)

37:24.533 --> 37:26.369
(Appeared in the CNS program
character documentary "Partners")

37:29.956 --> 37:33.334
Does anyone know why there is a CNS documentary filming on Park Yun-soo’s schedule ?

37:33.876 --> 37:36.796
It was Team Leader Song who arranged it, and Shengxi rushed to do it.

37:38.130 --> 37:39.173
I do not know how?

37:39.257 --> 37:41.133
Yes, why don’t you know?

37:41.217 --> 37:42.426
Didn’t Seunghee tell you?

37:43.761 --> 37:47.473
I heard that Agent Park refused once
but they kept pushing her.

37:51.310 --> 37:52.937
Who watches CNS documentaries these days?

37:56.315 --> 37:57.692
Those high-level people

38:06.075 --> 38:07.952
Hello, team leader, morning

38:08.035 --> 38:08.869
morning

38:10.121 --> 38:12.748
Team Leader Chi, would you like to make you a cup of coffee?

38:15.835 --> 38:17.461
-Agent Park
-Yes

38:17.545 --> 38:18.921
Did you come into the company to help me make coffee?

38:19.547 --> 38:21.132
Just do what you have to do

38:21.632 --> 38:22.925
And I don't drink coffee

38:23.009 --> 38:25.303
Caffeine gives me heart palpitations

38:29.265 --> 38:30.266
I drink

38:31.600 --> 38:33.686
2 tablespoons each of coffee, creamer and sugar

38:33.769 --> 38:34.812
That is three-in-one instant coffee

38:37.648 --> 38:38.607
sorry to bother you

38:38.691 --> 38:42.528
You are not my team leader, I will not help you rush

38:51.579 --> 38:53.331
What do you do early in the morning?

38:53.706 --> 38:54.665
that…

38:55.624 --> 38:57.084
I heard Agent Park

38:57.168 --> 38:59.628
Declined to shoot CNS documentary

39:00.254 --> 39:01.589
I want to ask

39:02.173 --> 39:06.052
Do you know the reason why Agent Park refused?

39:06.594 --> 39:09.138
As far as I know, you can refuse

39:09.638 --> 39:12.850
Yes, of course you can refuse

39:12.933 --> 39:13.934
But…

39:15.061 --> 39:16.312
why?

39:18.647 --> 39:20.941
You seem to think it's easy to get on a wireless station

39:21.025 --> 39:22.651
Actually not

39:23.110 --> 39:25.071
Besides, the title is pretty good.

39:25.154 --> 39:27.990
Everyone says you are the hope of the Republic of Korea

39:32.536 --> 39:34.538
Just let the organizer handle it.

39:34.622 --> 39:36.791
Why go out of your way to ask here in person?

39:36.874 --> 39:39.585
It's just because they can't handle it
that I came here personally.

39:39.794 --> 39:41.087
Pool leader

39:43.798 --> 39:45.716
Did you assign her work?

39:46.759 --> 39:50.262
Is that why you are so busy?
Is it because you are too busy?

39:50.346 --> 39:51.514
I need to confirm her itinerary

39:53.015 --> 39:55.684
My purpose for filming a TV documentary

39:56.060 --> 39:57.812
Is it to enhance the company's image?

39:57.895 --> 39:58.938
The target customer group is people in their 20s

40:00.106 --> 40:01.899
Then don't do it through TV documentaries

40:01.982 --> 40:04.276
I will find someone who specializes in interviewing wage earners.

40:04.360 --> 40:07.154
Well-known YouTube channel to shoot

40:08.322 --> 40:11.659
Main audience groups of CNS character documentaries

40:11.742 --> 40:13.035
Is the audience over 50 years old

40:13.327 --> 40:15.204
This is not in line with the target customer group

40:15.287 --> 40:18.916
And the YouTube channel is dedicated to discussing career development

40:18.999 --> 40:21.710
Can conduct more in-depth interviews

40:29.593 --> 40:30.594
That probably won't work

40:32.263 --> 40:33.389
In the company

40:33.514 --> 40:36.934
There is a long-established process

40:37.184 --> 40:38.102
Team Leader Song

40:38.811 --> 40:41.397
I will confirm this when I come back later.

40:41.480 --> 40:43.107
It's time for us to have a team leader meeting

40:59.039 --> 41:00.708
Will she still make a CNS documentary?

41:01.417 --> 41:04.086
Is there any reason why she didn't take the photo?

41:05.254 --> 41:08.757
Every time we were willing to bear the full production fee,
they were unwilling to shoot.

41:08.841 --> 41:10.634
This time he agreed.

41:11.260 --> 41:14.597
Let's get it straight.
Who are you doing this for?

41:15.222 --> 41:16.223
Vice president?

41:16.307 --> 41:18.559
Don’t we have clear goals and objectives?

41:20.019 --> 41:21.729
You disrespected her too much just now

41:23.522 --> 41:24.523
What did you say?

41:25.816 --> 41:28.110
- I won't force her
- Then let me do it

41:28.194 --> 41:29.278
She is my team member

41:29.361 --> 41:30.905
I remember I'm more senior than you, right?

41:41.207 --> 41:42.166
they arrived

41:43.709 --> 41:44.752
Representative Xu

41:50.674 --> 41:51.675
Hello

41:53.093 --> 41:55.638
Our team leader’s previous meeting will end later

41:55.721 --> 41:56.972
- Over there please
- Okay

42:02.645 --> 42:04.480
-The representative-
is here

42:11.946 --> 42:13.864
-Excuse me, Miss Shin Ji
-hyo-Yes

42:13.948 --> 42:15.950
Who is responsible for Sirdis?

42:16.033 --> 42:16.992
it's me

42:18.994 --> 42:20.746
It would be nice if it was, but it's not me

42:20.829 --> 42:22.498
The team leader must handle it personally

42:22.915 --> 42:25.125
Is Team Leader Chi personally responsible?

42:25.209 --> 42:26.877
Very good

42:41.225 --> 42:43.185
Leave some time for me another day

42:43.435 --> 42:45.229
I invite you to dinner

42:45.479 --> 42:47.398
Of course, eat what you like

42:53.112 --> 42:57.658
Nowadays, the younger generation
tends to do a lot of things in a short time

42:58.284 --> 43:00.578
- That leads to...
- Then I want roast beef.

43:00.661 --> 43:03.956
They often lack attention…

43:12.798 --> 43:13.757
Feel sorry

43:13.841 --> 43:14.675
It doesn't matter

43:16.010 --> 43:18.095
in daily life

43:18.178 --> 43:20.806
For example, while they were waiting for the bus...

43:26.687 --> 43:27.563
Hello

43:37.031 --> 43:37.865
(Section Chief Meng Zhejun)

43:37.948 --> 43:38.782
Where are you?

43:38.866 --> 43:39.742
You want this, right?

43:40.284 --> 43:41.410
right

43:41.493 --> 43:42.453
Pantry

43:42.536 --> 43:43.829
What do you do after get off work?

43:43.912 --> 43:44.788
What's wrong?

43:45.205 --> 43:47.416
Are there any good movies showing?

43:47.499 --> 43:48.417
right

43:48.959 --> 43:51.086
"August Photo Studio" is re-released

43:53.422 --> 43:54.423
That one again?

43:55.299 --> 43:56.300
Thanks

43:57.217 --> 43:58.218
It’s a big deal, Jae Min

43:58.302 --> 44:00.512
Someone is
posting nonsense about the eligibility-free program

44:12.941 --> 44:16.904
Any idea that employees select candidates through blind testing
is a lie.

44:17.029 --> 44:19.365
It is said that the senior management selected the person for publicity.

44:19.448 --> 44:20.616
I thought it was weird from the beginning

44:20.699 --> 44:21.950
Se Yong is cleaning up her image

44:22.034 --> 44:23.786
Making a big fuss just to admit someone

44:27.414 --> 44:29.500
Using people with no qualifications to promote themselves?

44:30.042 --> 44:32.127
Se Yong’s public relations office is not what it used to be.

44:32.211 --> 44:33.504
What image enhancement does this enhance?

44:33.587 --> 44:36.840
This kind of pomp and circumstance is no longer about walking in through the back door
, but coming in openly.

44:36.924 --> 44:38.384
I heard that the public relations office didn't give her any instructions about her work.

44:38.467 --> 44:39.551
She has no qualifications

44:39.635 --> 44:41.470
-She's not working either
. She will be dumped after her one-year contract expires.

44:41.553 --> 44:44.139
Do you want to send people with excellent qualifications to the factory?

44:44.223 --> 44:45.766
No one went to vote at all

44:45.849 --> 44:47.726
-Who voted?
-I didn’t vote either

44:47.851 --> 44:49.103
What? Why was she admitted?

44:49.186 --> 44:51.355
There are a bunch of people in our company who don't know how to read the discussion forum

44:51.438 --> 44:53.232
There is no point in discussing it here

44:53.649 --> 44:56.985
The first article about the eligibility-free program
was posted around 3:10 p.m.

44:57.069 --> 44:58.862
It's 3:45pm now

44:59.780 --> 45:02.282
But the number of messages has exploded

45:02.866 --> 45:05.327
I have never seen such a big commotion since I joined the company.

45:05.911 --> 45:07.955
I think we need to confirm the facts first

45:08.789 --> 45:10.082
Ms. Park Yun Zhao

45:10.165 --> 45:13.794
Selected by employees through blind testing.

45:13.877 --> 45:14.920
right?

45:17.840 --> 45:19.049
probably

45:20.384 --> 45:21.218
Nothing wrong?

45:22.302 --> 45:23.554
Isn't that a matter of course?

45:24.179 --> 45:26.515
Is not it? I do not know

45:27.516 --> 45:28.392
Where is the team leader?

45:28.475 --> 45:31.228
In the morning, he talked with the director of "Daguo Daily"

45:31.895 --> 45:33.772
We went drinking together with Houji.

45:36.024 --> 45:37.943
we need to check the facts

45:41.697 --> 45:43.866
Didn't he listen? He won't listen

45:43.949 --> 45:44.867
The call you made was not...

45:44.950 --> 45:48.871
He 's not very good at checking his phone when he's drinking with reporters.

45:52.458 --> 45:54.334
Brother Zhejun, where do you think they are?

45:55.043 --> 45:56.420
Gwanghwamun Octopus Shop

46:00.174 --> 46:01.592
(Who is eligible to vote under the Free Plan?)

46:01.675 --> 46:03.135
(I asked people in the same group and no one voted)

46:03.218 --> 46:04.803
(There are many comments
but many people did not vote)

46:04.887 --> 46:06.680
( Why should she admit the majority of people who didn’t vote ?)

46:16.565 --> 46:17.483
Really are

46:33.123 --> 46:34.124
What's up?

46:38.003 --> 46:39.630
This is a nonsensical discussion forum for Se Yong

46:41.298 --> 46:44.468
(Any idea that employees select candidates through blind testing
is a lie)

46:44.551 --> 46:47.596
Related articles have also begun to appear in the company discussion forum.

46:48.847 --> 46:50.682
If we just ignore...

46:52.100 --> 46:53.644
That shouldn't work, right?

46:56.021 --> 46:56.855
Damn it

47:01.318 --> 47:03.570
Just listen and say, "You've made a mistake."

47:03.654 --> 47:06.406
"The company is not
qualified to do this kind of thing. The plan is indeed chosen by you personally."

47:06.490 --> 47:07.616
Just deal with it

47:08.367 --> 47:10.285
Immediately write a statement and submit it to the Human Resources Office

47:10.369 --> 47:12.371
Post to the company forum during off-hours

47:12.454 --> 47:14.373
This matter must be resolved quickly

47:14.456 --> 47:15.874
Before get off work?

47:15.958 --> 47:16.875
right

47:17.376 --> 47:18.252
What's wrong?

47:19.044 --> 47:20.379
It's not like you haven't dealt with it before

47:20.963 --> 47:23.507
This kind of thing should be covered up quickly
to avoid causing a bigger fuss.

47:25.509 --> 47:27.427
Haven't you seen her resume?

47:27.803 --> 47:29.596
She works in digital PR

47:29.680 --> 47:31.431
Let her join your group!

47:31.515 --> 47:33.517
Honestly, I recommend the person who doesn't meet the qualifications.

47:33.600 --> 47:36.478
-Obviously it's you, because that way it's topical
- Hey!

47:36.562 --> 47:38.272
Hey, this is her job

47:38.355 --> 47:41.066
Become an Advocate for the Eligibility-Free Program

47:41.149 --> 47:44.278
That's why she was admitted

47:45.028 --> 47:46.989
if her qualifications are always in dispute

47:47.072 --> 47:49.408
That's not good for her or the company.

47:49.783 --> 47:52.119
For her sake, this matter must be brought to an end quickly

47:53.579 --> 47:54.580
You go

47:56.915 --> 47:57.916
Team leader

48:00.335 --> 48:01.378
This is not true, is it?

48:12.639 --> 48:14.016
( Answers to questions related to recruitment regardless of qualifications are provided here )

48:14.099 --> 48:15.851
(The recent false news that qualifications are not limited to the recruitment process may cause our company...)

48:15.934 --> 48:18.854
It's not that bad overall

48:19.855 --> 48:20.898
But where to focus…

48:20.981 --> 48:22.190
I'm going to get off work

48:22.274 --> 48:23.108
good

48:23.442 --> 48:26.695
It’s not clear where the focus should be.

48:26.820 --> 48:28.113
I thought so

48:28.196 --> 48:30.699
How about highlighting this part?

48:30.824 --> 48:32.159
- And don't want this
- this way?

48:32.242 --> 48:33.201
right

48:33.285 --> 48:34.328
-Okay, I got it
-Okay

48:34.912 --> 48:36.330
besides…

48:38.123 --> 48:40.292
Then we need to use something else here

48:40.375 --> 48:43.003
- Want to make up for it?
-Yes, it would be better to make up for it here.

48:43.086 --> 48:44.254
-Fix this side or...
-Yes

48:44.838 --> 48:47.215
-I'm going to get off work
-Okay

48:47.299 --> 48:50.093
Content and pictures, think about which one is better...

48:50.177 --> 48:51.011
yes

48:58.352 --> 49:00.479
( Answers to questions related to recruitment regardless of qualifications are provided here )

49:01.396 --> 49:02.648
Too much content has been deleted, right?

49:03.690 --> 49:04.733
Almost half deleted

49:07.235 --> 49:09.905
The team leader’s explanation should be brief.

49:11.865 --> 49:13.700
so things get worse

49:14.952 --> 49:16.745
Everyone criticized
the company for uploading the statement after working hours

49:18.246 --> 49:20.082
I don’t think this can be called a statement either.

49:23.293 --> 49:24.252
Borrow it

49:24.336 --> 49:25.212
Excuse me

49:25.295 --> 49:26.546
I borrowed it, sorry

49:26.630 --> 49:27.839
I borrowed it, sorry

49:27.923 --> 49:29.049
Excuse me

49:30.175 --> 49:31.885
-Sorry
. What did you hit?

49:31.969 --> 49:33.595
The train door is closing

49:34.137 --> 49:35.305
The train door is closing

49:35.389 --> 49:36.264
Alas

49:36.348 --> 49:37.849
Sorry, lend me a hand

49:37.933 --> 49:39.184
Stand in a little bit

49:52.197 --> 49:54.324
The person who came in regardless of his qualifications
was selected by the senior management.

49:54.908 --> 49:57.494
This is a shocking fact told to me by a colleague in the public relations office

49:57.577 --> 49:59.246
There was an article before about several team leaders in the public relations office.

49:59.329 --> 50:01.415
Are you going to quarrel because your qualifications are not limited?

50:01.957 --> 50:03.125
I heard that thing is true

50:03.500 --> 50:06.420
After she joined the company,
no group in the PR office wanted her.

50:06.837 --> 50:08.505
Yes, no surprise

50:09.131 --> 50:10.674
An online university has produced a talent

50:11.174 --> 50:13.719
Sure enough, the truth will eventually come out

50:19.808 --> 50:22.894
(Is Shirong recruiting employees for publicity?)

50:22.978 --> 50:25.564
Why should I waste four years in college?

50:25.981 --> 50:27.441
If there is a next life

50:27.524 --> 50:29.234
I also imagine her entering the company with a diploma from an online university

50:31.194 --> 50:33.113
Hey, did you know that person was chosen by the senior management?

50:33.447 --> 50:34.865
Yeah, I heard that, it's crazy

50:34.948 --> 50:37.576
The team leaders of the PR office even had a big fight over this.

50:37.659 --> 50:38.994
We were raped by an unqualified person

50:39.077 --> 50:40.412
-It's making a big fuss
-That's what I mean

50:40.495 --> 50:41.663
The atmosphere was tense

50:41.747 --> 50:43.957
It's so annoying to be in the same company as her

50:44.166 --> 50:45.250
Really, so embarrassing

50:45.333 --> 50:47.377
Really, the phone keeps ringing

50:47.461 --> 50:50.172
Their sense of smell for gossip is as sharp
as a bedbug's

50:50.839 --> 50:51.673
Hello? Hello

50:51.757 --> 50:53.842
Hello, Reporter Park, yes

50:53.925 --> 50:54.885
it's not like that

50:54.968 --> 50:56.303
When did you see it?

50:56.553 --> 50:58.930
-No
-Really, what are you talking about?

50:59.014 --> 51:01.433
It was just a little farce

51:01.516 --> 51:02.768
- That was a misunderstanding
- Yes

51:02.893 --> 51:05.103
We have published our official position in the company discussion forum

51:05.896 --> 51:08.607
-There are indeed many creative messages
- why don't you believe it?

51:08.690 --> 51:09.524
correct

51:09.608 --> 51:11.943
But you shouldn’t add fuel to the fire, right?

51:12.027 --> 51:13.695
I wish you could revise the wording a bit...

51:13.779 --> 51:14.780
okay, thank you

51:14.863 --> 51:16.406
-What? Hello?
-goodbye

51:16.490 --> 51:17.449
Hello?

51:18.658 --> 51:19.993
hateful

51:20.660 --> 51:22.871
Who was in the public relations office at the same time?

51:23.205 --> 51:25.165
Thanks to that article, things got even bigger again.

51:25.874 --> 51:28.460
Where has Agent Liu gone?
Was it a good thing he did?

51:28.543 --> 51:30.045
- No way
- Damn it

51:31.421 --> 51:32.798
-Hello?
-Hello?

51:32.881 --> 51:35.467
The wrong use of one person caused such a big disturbance

51:36.218 --> 51:38.762
I can hear
the calls from the PR office coming and going from here.

51:39.221 --> 51:41.264
The atmosphere in their office must be tense

51:42.224 --> 51:43.850
"Se Yong's plan to not restrict qualifications caused controversy"

51:43.934 --> 51:46.019
"The hot potato in social platforms for wage earners"

51:46.144 --> 51:49.481
Oh my god, it’s in the news.
Has Saeyong finally made the headlines on the portal?

51:50.023 --> 51:52.734
It made the news after all. It’s really embarrassing.

51:55.195 --> 51:57.280
All the parties involved are here, have you had enough of talking?

51:57.364 --> 51:58.740
How do you look at other people's screens?

51:58.824 --> 52:00.117
Then don't let me see it

52:01.493 --> 52:02.536
How is she?

52:02.828 --> 52:04.287
It's too much

52:07.249 --> 52:08.125
(Office of the Director of Public Relations Office)

52:08.208 --> 52:09.042
Now

52:09.126 --> 52:11.545
The chief was furious

52:11.795 --> 52:14.214
This incident even appeared in the daily newspapers

52:14.798 --> 52:17.926
And it’s a daily newspaper that the vice president reads every day!

52:22.722 --> 52:25.892
Now everyone says this is reverse discrimination

52:26.351 --> 52:27.519
What to do now?

52:27.602 --> 52:30.230
You hire someone who is not qualified

52:30.313 --> 52:32.315
What are you going to do now?

52:32.482 --> 52:35.569
You shouldn't say she's not qualified enough, right?

52:36.486 --> 52:39.239
Everyone says that

52:48.373 --> 52:50.083
Why don't you say anything?

52:51.001 --> 52:52.544
What are you going to do?

52:58.008 --> 52:59.509
About that employee

53:00.135 --> 53:02.262
The employee who caused controversy

53:03.972 --> 53:05.182
Tell me about it

53:08.643 --> 53:10.437
Can we fire her?

53:14.482 --> 53:15.901
(Is Shirong recruiting employees for publicity?)

53:15.984 --> 53:17.527
(There are a lot of discussions on the social platforms of migrant workers)

53:17.611 --> 53:19.237
( Weird recruitment where lack of qualifications becomes a qualification ?)

53:19.321 --> 53:20.572
(Suspicion of inappropriate recruitment by Se Yong)

53:29.748 --> 53:31.249
(Before, they advertised that they only select elites)

53:31.333 --> 53:33.210
(The person who came in regardless of qualifications
was selected by the senior management)

53:48.975 --> 53:50.060
Thanks for your hard work

55:47.927 --> 55:49.971
