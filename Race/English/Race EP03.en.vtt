01:29.297 --> 01:30.298
right

01:31.007 --> 01:31.841
OK, thank you

01:33.218 --> 01:34.219
goodbye

01:38.264 --> 01:39.307
Miss Yun Zhao?

01:44.354 --> 01:45.271
Feel sorry

01:46.231 --> 01:48.316
What did you just say?

01:49.359 --> 01:50.902
Who called?

01:52.445 --> 01:53.279
I…

01:54.030 --> 01:55.740
Admitted by Shi Rong

01:56.407 --> 01:58.701
They have released special recruitment quotas

02:01.204 --> 02:02.247
That's it

02:04.040 --> 02:05.291
(Jae Min)

02:05.834 --> 02:06.918
that…

02:07.752 --> 02:10.630
Representative Xu, what you just proposed to me...

02:10.713 --> 02:11.923
No, nothing

02:12.215 --> 02:14.008
Next time, we'll talk about it later

02:14.092 --> 02:16.761
Listen quickly, I should be calling to congratulate you.

02:17.428 --> 02:18.429
Okay, thank you

02:20.473 --> 02:21.599
What's wrong?

02:22.350 --> 02:23.226
Shi Rong?

02:23.309 --> 02:26.688
Yeah, I got the call.
That's not a big deal.

02:27.814 --> 02:30.108
Come on, of course it's amazing.

02:30.191 --> 02:31.776
Hey, am I right?

02:32.944 --> 02:34.028
Can not believe it!

02:34.863 --> 02:36.114
I just received the call

02:36.781 --> 02:38.992
- The timing is just perfect
- Oh my god

02:40.118 --> 02:42.203
Of course we should celebrate this kind of thing

02:42.996 --> 02:46.207
So I want you to promise
not to push my face into the cake.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.793
Then I'll pick a really delicious cake

02:48.877 --> 02:50.962
Don't worry about the cake, just come.

02:51.045 --> 02:52.297
There's no celebration party today

02:53.006 --> 02:53.882
Why?

02:53.965 --> 02:55.842
She was clamoring for me to buy a cake just now

02:55.925 --> 03:00.054
I don’t know, she’s worried about how to leave her boss now.

03:00.138 --> 03:01.890
Please tell her for me
that not being nervous is also a virtue.

03:01.973 --> 03:03.474
Is there such a saying?

03:03.558 --> 03:07.187
You are indeed a Chinese major, and your literary attainments are really good.

03:08.313 --> 03:11.733
Hey, Xiaomin said, "Not being nervous is also a virtue."

03:12.525 --> 03:13.359
(Jae Min)

03:13.443 --> 03:15.945
Hey, I'm not crazy, I'm really worried

03:16.029 --> 03:18.531
You have never had a good boss,
so you cannot empathize with me.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.533
you poor guys

03:22.535 --> 03:24.662
If she doesn't plan to report her death,
tell her to reply quickly.

03:24.746 --> 03:27.123
There are still a bunch of
people waiting to be replaced who don’t have to worry about their bosses.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.291
I'll close the line first

03:29.667 --> 03:30.585
Did you hear that?

03:31.794 --> 03:33.588
Is he too heartless sometimes?

03:34.380 --> 03:36.758
But he's also the smartest among us

03:37.508 --> 03:38.384
She also looks the best

03:42.305 --> 03:44.974
Don't take it too seriously, I just said it casually

03:46.517 --> 03:48.519
Forget it, you'd better sort out your thoughts.

03:49.187 --> 03:50.021
Hello

03:51.064 --> 03:52.398
I've already made up my mind

03:52.482 --> 03:54.567
We are just friends now

03:58.947 --> 04:01.866
Are you talking about our representatives? knew

04:04.786 --> 04:07.538
You crazy woman, really

-Representative
-What's wrong?

04:13.461 --> 04:14.462
Are you going out?

04:14.545 --> 04:19.050
Yes, I will get off work directly after finishing the meeting with the client.

04:19.133 --> 04:22.470
If you have nothing to do,
just finish packing and go back early.

04:22.553 --> 04:24.889
-represent!
-Yes, what's wrong?

04:25.932 --> 04:27.976
-What's up?
-that…

04:28.893 --> 04:30.228
What's wrong?

04:32.188 --> 04:34.274
Nothing, please walk slowly

04:34.857 --> 04:36.526
Ouch, so boring

04:38.278 --> 04:39.821
-I am leaving
, bye

04:44.826 --> 04:46.411
Why did she leave so early?

would like to inform you that you have been admitted in 2022...)

06:25.218 --> 06:27.011
You're here, Yun Zhao

06:27.929 --> 06:28.805
Look at this

06:31.391 --> 06:32.600
What do you think this is?

06:33.267 --> 06:34.102
Chair?

06:35.103 --> 06:36.229
Yeah?

06:38.564 --> 06:40.858
Then I'll make it into a chair

06:42.360 --> 06:46.489
You are a chair from now on, a chair

06:46.572 --> 06:51.035
It's so late.
Why don't you go home and come to see me instead?

06:51.536 --> 06:53.371
I'll tell you after you finish.

06:53.955 --> 06:55.081
What is it?

06:55.748 --> 06:56.624
What's wrong?

06:57.208 --> 07:00.128
What is going on? Say it

07:07.009 --> 07:09.262
I want to have my own brand

07:10.847 --> 07:14.058
In an agency, I always deal with other people’s brands.

07:14.308 --> 07:16.394
That desire began to emerge in my heart

07:16.978 --> 07:21.315
Of course I understand that the client's brand
is actually equivalent to my...

07:22.233 --> 07:23.276
please

07:24.152 --> 07:26.070
Do you think I don't understand that feeling?

07:26.654 --> 07:28.656
I can totally understand

07:28.739 --> 07:32.034
I have worked in both large companies and agencies.

07:32.535 --> 07:35.371
I just don’t want my dreams
to come to an end in vain

07:36.247 --> 07:37.832
I just have such a good opportunity

07:39.584 --> 07:40.418
congratulations

07:41.752 --> 07:43.254
I'm proud of you, Yun Zhao

07:45.089 --> 07:46.299
Sorry, representative

07:46.382 --> 07:48.551
What's there to be sorry for?

07:49.552 --> 07:53.723
Gosh, I sure
have a knack for developing talent, right?

07:54.140 --> 07:55.266
Are you okay?

07:55.349 --> 07:58.436
Alas, just hire new people

08:02.648 --> 08:04.233
Okay, it's time for us to go

08:06.027 --> 08:07.945
Do you want me to have a drink with you?

08:10.364 --> 08:12.241
Not today, next time

08:14.660 --> 08:15.661
OK

08:44.649 --> 08:46.359
Are you depressed because Yun Zhao was admitted by Shi Rong
?

08:47.443 --> 08:48.819
How did you know?

08:48.903 --> 08:51.030
It's nothing, I just learned about it accidentally

08:52.073 --> 08:54.825
Oh, this is something worth being happy about

08:55.451 --> 08:57.745
But why am I so upset?

09:00.456 --> 09:04.669
I always tell myself not to invest too much emotion
, but I always forget it again and again

09:06.128 --> 09:08.756
Once I develop feelings for them,
it won't end well in the end.

09:09.257 --> 09:11.592
Because they will eventually
leave for a better way out

09:12.593 --> 09:14.804
I can't be their final stop

09:15.930 --> 09:16.931
Alas

09:17.014 --> 09:19.350
Hey, Dongxun, I seem drunk

09:21.811 --> 09:23.145
Are you so reluctant to give up?

09:25.523 --> 09:26.357
right

09:28.150 --> 09:31.028
Not long ago, you clearly asked me to take Park Yun Zhao away.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.991
Would I feel more relieved if she went to your company
?

09:35.074 --> 09:37.785
I was also sad when you left Universal Communications, okay?

09:37.868 --> 09:39.495
But we meet again now

09:39.579 --> 09:41.581
If we are destined, we will meet again

09:41.664 --> 09:42.665
cheers

09:48.921 --> 09:50.881
Why don't you come back to our company this time?

09:55.386 --> 09:58.055
You're such a bad boy

09:58.139 --> 10:00.850
Hey, the position of team leader is too...

10:00.933 --> 10:02.393
Let's get rid of Cao Ya's public relations.

10:03.394 --> 10:07.231
The project that Cao Ya Public Relations was originally working on
can be taken over by Global Communications

10:08.065 --> 10:10.651
Both cosmetics and high-protein bread can continue to advance

10:13.904 --> 10:15.573
It seems you are not drunk yet

10:16.240 --> 10:17.825
I'll make you a co-representative

10:18.534 --> 10:20.911
Even Shi Yong can't intervene in this kind of thing

10:20.995 --> 10:24.332
Besides, if we join forces,
we will definitely stimulate Shirong hard.

To all members of the Serong family,
I wish you an energetic day.

13:31.227 --> 13:33.145
Those who do public relations these days

13:33.604 --> 13:34.605
All lack perseverance

13:35.773 --> 13:38.442
We used to stay up all night drinking

13:38.526 --> 13:41.529
I can still arrive at the company on time at 7 a.m. the next day.

13:42.446 --> 13:44.490
Even if you faint, you will still fall in the company

13:45.324 --> 13:46.575
you are right

13:46.909 --> 13:49.662
When Agent Jin comes, I will definitely tell him

13:53.332 --> 13:54.792
Let's go, Agent Liu

13:54.875 --> 13:55.751
OK

13:58.546 --> 13:59.588
Where are you going?

14:00.047 --> 14:01.048
Go to a team leader meeting

14:03.884 --> 14:07.429
He asked me to personally report to the director of the office.
The media promotion strategy is not limited to the plan.

14:07.513 --> 14:08.389
Team leader meeting?

14:10.224 --> 14:12.810
This sentence makes my soul
feel like it has been ravaged in every possible way

14:15.729 --> 14:19.024
The Bible contains all the truths in the world

14:19.608 --> 14:20.860
It is recorded inside

14:20.943 --> 14:25.573
"If you seek, you will find.
If you knock, the door will open to you."

14:27.700 --> 14:31.036
There is nothing impossible in this world

14:31.120 --> 14:32.079
Amen

14:33.873 --> 14:38.419
What's more, those
employees who have the strength to enter our world

14:39.503 --> 14:42.673
You shouldn’t make excuses for your lack of ability…

14:42.756 --> 14:44.425
-Chief Chen
-What's wrong?

14:44.508 --> 14:47.761
I'm sorry to interrupt your precious speech.

14:48.262 --> 14:51.765
But there is one last item left on the agenda.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.645
It’s a public relations press release with no qualifications.

14:56.729 --> 14:57.938
yes

14:58.022 --> 14:59.690
- Yes
- We haven't discussed that yet.

15:00.441 --> 15:03.402
The representative asked us to exclude "Da Guo Daily"

15:03.485 --> 15:06.030
But the consequences of doing so may be unimaginable

15:06.405 --> 15:08.449
However, if "Da Guo Daily" is added to the list

15:09.533 --> 15:12.202
-That's tantamount to disobeying the representative's order.
-That's it.

15:12.995 --> 15:15.289
She has just been promoted from head office to representative

15:15.581 --> 15:18.292
So we should pay special attention to her feelings.

15:18.417 --> 15:19.793
Yes, you are right

15:19.877 --> 15:22.546
So I found the person in charge

15:22.630 --> 15:25.215
- You might as well listen to his opinion
- Okay

15:26.800 --> 15:29.303
Just send the press release to the news agency

15:29.386 --> 15:32.139
There is no need to send it to Daguo Ilbo
and the top ten central comprehensive dailies.

15:32.848 --> 15:34.725
Anyway, whether it’s a TV station or a newspaper

15:34.808 --> 15:36.477
They all receive reports from news agencies

15:36.977 --> 15:38.938
"Daguo Daily" is not the only one who is excluded in this way.

15:39.021 --> 15:40.648
It will also be easier for us to cope with

15:41.273 --> 15:42.107
sounds good

15:42.650 --> 15:44.151
Just do as you say

15:45.027 --> 15:46.445
As expected of the second group

15:53.285 --> 15:56.413
Agent Caimin, do you go to church?

15:57.998 --> 15:59.875
No, I am not religious...

16:02.795 --> 16:03.629
The so-called faith…

16:03.712 --> 16:04.797
-Chief Chen
-huh?

16:05.422 --> 16:07.883
I believe in non-discriminatory employment, regardless of qualifications

16:07.967 --> 16:09.510
is a good starting point

16:10.970 --> 16:12.805
But why is it our group?

16:39.915 --> 16:42.793
Dear Shirong employees

16:42.876 --> 16:44.211
nice to meet you

16:44.586 --> 16:46.171
Given that economies of scale are rapidly…

16:46.255 --> 16:48.257
If you are recruiting employees from the public relations department this time,

16:48.340 --> 16:51.510
Then they should be assigned to
the group that plans and executes the project.

16:52.177 --> 16:56.265
Suddenly putting people into our group
will really make it difficult for us to do things.

16:56.348 --> 16:57.224
Director Chen

17:00.728 --> 17:04.064
- I thought the matter was settled
- Yes, it was settled

17:04.148 --> 17:05.607
But I never agreed

17:05.691 --> 17:07.735
You didn't come to the meeting yourself

17:07.860 --> 17:11.613
I asked to change the meeting time
, but you still held the meeting as usual

17:11.697 --> 17:14.283
If you are unable to attend the meeting due to personal matters
, you will have to bear the consequences yourself.

17:14.366 --> 17:15.242
This is a company

17:15.325 --> 17:17.453
Can't you be a little more flexible in what you do?

17:17.536 --> 17:19.955
This matter is not that urgent

17:20.039 --> 17:21.040
Pool leader

17:21.373 --> 17:22.291
if that is the case

17:23.625 --> 17:25.085
Still have to open it again...

17:25.169 --> 17:26.795
No, no need

17:26.879 --> 17:29.757
Team Leader Chi is just making trouble unreasonably.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.760
This matter is a foregone conclusion

17:32.843 --> 17:35.596
Besides, that employee also came to report today.

17:35.679 --> 17:36.722
Pool leader

17:37.973 --> 17:38.974
You take people away first

17:39.058 --> 17:40.225
Anyway...

17:49.526 --> 17:52.196
-Okay, then I'll start...
-That's it.

17:52.696 --> 17:55.157
So that concludes today’s team leader meeting

17:55.282 --> 17:56.784
-ok
-very good

18:01.997 --> 18:03.040
Yes, good work

18:11.173 --> 18:12.091
Hello, Chi Yinzhen

18:12.633 --> 18:14.301
Haven't you seen her resume?

18:15.052 --> 18:16.887
She works in digital PR

18:16.970 --> 18:19.389
These days, anyone can say that they are in digital public relations.

18:19.473 --> 18:20.682
I can't believe that.

18:21.141 --> 18:22.559
So what do you want?

18:22.643 --> 18:24.728
Let her join your group!

18:25.771 --> 18:27.815
Honestly, I recommend the person who doesn't meet the qualifications.

18:27.898 --> 18:29.608
It's obviously you, because that's how it's topical

18:29.691 --> 18:30.692
Hello!

18:34.696 --> 18:36.990
Be careful what you say, you know?

18:37.491 --> 18:39.451
All the newcomers from the past also joined our group.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.870
Do you want our three groups to sit back and wait for death?

18:46.792 --> 18:49.670
That's the good thing about being in the public relations room.
You can take a break and have a cup of coffee.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.256
Has Hou Ji come to work?

18:52.756 --> 18:54.049
Damn Kim Ho-gil

18:54.800 --> 18:55.843
Speaking of that brat

18:56.093 --> 18:57.177
you know him now

18:57.261 --> 18:59.304
Didn't he even reveal which reporters he was drinking with?

18:59.638 --> 19:00.722
Well managed

19:01.265 --> 19:02.349
He will stand out

19:02.850 --> 19:04.601
In my opinion, he will only last three years

19:05.102 --> 19:07.563
He will definitely leave his job within three years
and start his own company.

19:07.980 --> 19:11.441
Look, this is
a common tactic used by people who love to flatter reporters.

19:11.859 --> 19:13.944
This, I'm not interested

19:14.444 --> 19:15.654
me too

19:18.782 --> 19:21.660
By the way, Team Leader Chi just said something strange.

19:21.869 --> 19:22.703
What words?

19:22.786 --> 19:24.621
She said that Team Leader Song strongly recommended Park Yun-soo for this recruitment.

19:24.705 --> 19:25.789
Yeah?

19:25.873 --> 19:27.124
Really?

19:29.084 --> 19:30.294
Do you really have no idea?

19:30.377 --> 19:32.045
Yeah, I really don't know

19:33.547 --> 19:34.923
But how could he push her?

19:35.215 --> 19:36.842
Didn't you do a blind test at the beginning?

19:40.179 --> 19:41.221
anyway

19:42.347 --> 19:45.017
Do you know that person who admitted with any qualifications?

19:46.059 --> 19:47.477
Otherwise, why would you be interested?

19:49.146 --> 19:50.314
Because that's what I'm responsible for

19:50.397 --> 19:52.691
That being said, you're acting a little suspicious.

19:53.984 --> 19:55.110
It's time for us to go back

19:55.194 --> 19:56.320
You know me, right?

19:56.778 --> 19:58.197
I have God-given intuition.

19:58.280 --> 19:59.615
I feel it now

19:59.698 --> 20:01.950
Stop drinking coffee and have a beer.

20:02.492 --> 20:03.368
Or do you want soju?

20:03.702 --> 20:04.620
All right

20:08.332 --> 20:09.374

20:11.168 --> 20:12.211

Please over there

20:31.271 --> 20:34.274
This is the newcomer who will join us in the future, Ms. Zheng Zhiren.

20:34.358 --> 20:35.192
Say hello

20:35.275 --> 20:36.318
Please give me some advice

21:13.063 --> 21:14.523
-He...
-Super annoying.

No, it's super strong

21:20.487 --> 21:21.405
(Team leader, Song Xuantai)

21:21.488 --> 21:22.447
He's really super strong

21:24.658 --> 21:27.911
Also, let’s just pretend we don’t know each other in the company.

21:29.705 --> 21:31.373
Because I hope to rely on myself for everything

21:31.456 --> 21:32.541
Can you understand?

21:33.667 --> 21:34.960
up to you

21:35.961 --> 21:37.170
Really

21:37.254 --> 21:38.422
Then why are you receiving special training now?

(Public Relations Group Three, Team Leader, Chi Yinzhen)

21:45.262 --> 21:46.722
Public Relations Group 3, also the Digital Public Relations Group

21:46.847 --> 21:48.223
The team leader is Chi Yinzhen

21:49.683 --> 21:52.227
She was the first to become a team leader among those who were publicly recruited at the same time.

21:53.145 --> 21:56.023
He is also the only deputy chief appointed as the team leader.

21:57.190 --> 21:59.443
Team leader Chi, this is Miss Park Yun-jo

22:00.110 --> 22:02.279
nice to meet you

22:02.362 --> 22:04.239

He is a designer personally hired by the digital public relations team to strengthen the design field.

He is in a state of being drained of energy

22:30.390 --> 22:32.434
Have you read the draft I sent you earlier?

22:32.517 --> 22:34.686
I'll watch that after the meeting.

22:35.729 --> 22:36.730
OK

22:37.647 --> 22:39.483
Agent Xu, you also need to have a meeting together.

22:41.651 --> 22:43.487
But I still have a lot to do…

22:46.198 --> 22:47.741
Agent Park, this is your seat

22:49.493 --> 22:50.577
Let's go

23:02.464 --> 23:03.882
"Agent Park"?

23:05.634 --> 23:08.553
I haven’t heard anyone call me Agent Park for a long time.

23:16.686 --> 23:18.855
By the way, the public relations office uses open recruitment

23:18.939 --> 23:21.191
The only new person admitted is in the third group

23:28.198 --> 23:29.533
Otherwise, why would I come to work in a place like this?

23:29.616 --> 23:31.618
No work-life balance
, even the salary sucks

23:31.701 --> 23:33.161
Then just leave

23:33.245 --> 23:35.956
Yes, that's what I meant,
so I'm going to stop doing it from today on

23:37.374 --> 23:39.793
Could it be that you are the one who has no qualifications...

23:42.087 --> 23:43.880
Unexpectedly, we met again

23:44.965 --> 23:46.675

She was hired to be the chief public relations officer and executive director?

25:01.333 --> 25:02.375
Se Yong's chief public relations officer?

25:03.335 --> 25:04.419
It's really unheard of

25:04.544 --> 25:06.129
Then isn't she our direct supervisor?

25:06.213 --> 25:08.298
That's why everyone is in a mess now

25:08.381 --> 25:10.759
The chief public relations officer is the immediate boss of the public relations office

25:11.426 --> 25:13.970
But the PR office knew nothing about this
personnel appointment?

25:14.721 --> 25:16.848
Will Director Chen be fired?

25:17.474 --> 25:20.602
It's hard to say. The life span of a high-level boss
can be described as life and death.

Yes, Agent Jae Min

So who is she?

25:49.339 --> 25:50.757
It's really her

25:51.174 --> 25:53.385
Cable News Network has also published several
interviews with her.

25:54.094 --> 25:55.428
She is a public relations expert

27:32.317 --> 27:34.486
No one knows what she is thinking

27:34.569 --> 27:37.572
They actually created a new position of chief public relations officer
and brought people back.

27:37.656 --> 27:41.117
She must have drunk too much foreign ink
, so she doesn’t understand how things work in Korea.

27:41.201 --> 27:44.079
I'm worried she'll do other ridiculous things

27:45.288 --> 27:48.750
This was the first thing she prepared after taking office as the representative director.

27:49.417 --> 27:52.337
I think she should have her own plan

27:54.464 --> 27:55.840
Go and inquire more carefully

27:55.924 --> 27:57.801
Let’s see what kind of work she does mainly

27:58.468 --> 27:59.803

Do you know this person?

31:25.925 --> 31:27.010
who is she?

31:27.093 --> 31:29.470
She left Zter not long ago

31:29.554 --> 31:31.347
Switched to public relations career for American start-up companies

31:31.431 --> 31:33.224
what are you saying?

31:33.641 --> 31:35.977
I'm not going to spend my whole life making company publications.

31:36.060 --> 31:38.354
I want to be like her in the future

31:38.438 --> 31:40.815
She should have also produced company publications in the beginning.

31:42.066 --> 31:43.359
Have you confirmed it?

31:43.693 --> 31:44.819
Yes, let me confirm

31:44.903 --> 31:46.154
Really

Everyone, sit down, sit down...

34:06.586 --> 34:10.548
Hello! Don't sit down. What are you doing sitting down?
What's wrong?

34:10.631 --> 34:13.217
Oh my god, my daughter is back.

34:13.301 --> 34:14.802

Come, have another drink

35:02.141 --> 35:04.769

35:11.359 --> 35:12.693
Have you been back?

35:13.986 --> 35:15.071
So annoying

35:15.154 --> 35:17.907
The guard guy kept running up
, and even the police came

35:23.287 --> 35:26.916
By the way, when you pay me,
you will help me buy a pair of brand-name sneakers.

Ouch, I'm almost exhausted

35:44.684 --> 35:45.852
Hello

36:15.339 --> 36:16.549
-Hi
-Hmm

36:30.104 --> 36:31.606
Why don't you give me some hints?

36:32.481 --> 36:33.983
unacceptable

36:35.443 --> 36:38.946
That's a special instruction from the representative. I have to keep it a secret.

36:41.449 --> 36:42.450
but

36:43.159 --> 36:45.286
I really can't understand

36:45.369 --> 36:48.372
Just add a rank above the director of the public relations office

36:48.456 --> 36:51.209
Is it necessary to make it look like an espionage war?

36:51.959 --> 36:54.545
-I don’t know about that either.
-Young Master

36:54.629 --> 36:55.880
I am not kidding

36:56.547 --> 36:57.965
Maybe the head of the strategy room will know

36:58.090 --> 36:59.425
He doesn't answer the phone at all

37:05.181 --> 37:07.683
Chief Kim called me just now

37:08.392 --> 37:12.104
He said that the vice president asked him to find
someone who could be the head of the Strategy Headquarters.

37:13.064 --> 37:13.898
What?

37:15.274 --> 37:19.654
In other words, if even
the head of the Strategy Headquarters is from the vice president's side...

37:20.988 --> 37:21.864
That means...

37:21.948 --> 37:24.200
She will become in name only

37:30.581 --> 37:33.209
You should know how much the vice president loves the media, right?

37:33.292 --> 37:34.794
He still reads the newspaper every day

37:36.879 --> 37:40.549
You need to prepare a plan for this time that the qualifications are not restricted.

37:41.384 --> 37:42.510
Try to be as high-profile as possible

38:07.702 --> 38:08.786

-Yes

-you are here

40:23.129 --> 40:26.215
Representative, Global Communication is beautiful

40:26.298 --> 40:27.133
Beautiful, right?

40:27.800 --> 40:30.469
Because Dongxun majored in design

40:30.553 --> 40:32.221
He decorated this place himself

40:32.304 --> 40:33.764
He's really talented

40:33.848 --> 40:35.641
He will come over later, let's have dinner together

It's great. Everyone is very kind to me.

Hello

Since you're working here now,
it's up to you to take over.

42:09.443 --> 42:12.071
Shi Rong still doesn’t know that I’m working here.

42:14.240 --> 42:17.159
They want to spread the word around the world and it’s up to them.

42:20.871 --> 42:21.705

42:49.775 --> 42:51.902

42:53.279 --> 42:54.989
I think it's up to me to say

42:56.282 --> 42:57.449
sorry

42:57.741 --> 42:58.826
what are you saying?

42:59.868 --> 43:02.454
That was an offer that was impossible to refuse.

43:02.580 --> 43:04.164
No, it should be said to be an order

43:04.832 --> 43:06.625
So don't take it too seriously

43:07.960 --> 43:10.421
But I still feel very guilty for her

43:11.088 --> 43:12.381
That's true

I really feel sorry for her, that's right

43:56.759 --> 43:58.636
To drain her of all her worth

43:59.053 --> 44:02.473

is enough to leave her with no time to do other work.

What other job does she have?

44:08.020 --> 44:09.938

Become an Advocate for the Eligibility-Free Program

44:14.777 --> 44:16.945
That's why she was admitted

44:20.741 --> 44:22.201

Hello! Agent Liu!

Yes, team leader

How is the global communications plan going?

44:55.943 --> 44:57.653
-Sildis' project
-The other party has not yet given a definite reply.

44:57.736 --> 44:58.904
what are they going to do

44:58.987 --> 45:01.240
Why? Have you made it clear to them?

45:02.282 --> 45:05.411
Can't you even convey the company's intentions well?

45:06.328 --> 45:08.914
It seems like you're just relaying it like a megaphone again

45:08.997 --> 45:11.417
Didn't understand the meaning at all

45:11.875 --> 45:15.838
Do you really have a way
to manage those agencies well?

45:16.964 --> 45:18.716
Go back and explain it clearly to them.

45:19.216 --> 45:21.593
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?

45:23.595 --> 45:26.890
Please use your brain, Jaemin.

45:29.768 --> 45:31.603
so what you mean is

45:32.312 --> 45:34.314
We adopt the plan from Cao Ya Public Relations

45:34.732 --> 45:36.150
Completely out of necessity

45:36.233 --> 45:38.235
Because
all team leaders were not hired through open recruitment.

45:38.318 --> 45:40.237
I have the support of Minister Kim behind me.

45:40.904 --> 45:43.282
Therefore, Global Media should arbitrarily
steal other people’s plans.

45:43.365 --> 45:45.159
Or you have to spend your own money to buy it.

45:45.242 --> 45:47.494
Is this what you want to convey?

46:00.966 --> 46:01.967
Yes, that's right

46:03.135 --> 46:05.721
-That's what it means
. -Okay, then I get it.

Just now, Team Leader Song

46:46.386 --> 46:47.221
Did you run away in despair?

46:47.304 --> 46:48.847
He must feel so embarrassed

46:48.931 --> 46:52.559
He certainly never thought that
those words he said would turn Yijun against him.

46:52.643 --> 46:53.936
Alas, Agent Liu

46:54.311 --> 46:56.271
I appreciate your madness very much

46:56.355 --> 46:58.899
If it were me, I would be fired immediately

47:01.109 --> 47:03.737
It seems that the trump card is still the trump card even if it goes astray.

47:03.821 --> 47:06.990
This society is really unfair, right?

47:11.995 --> 47:13.121

-why me?
-This is your job.

47:21.421 --> 47:23.173
- But not anymore
- Are you kidding me?

47:24.174 --> 47:26.051
Didn’t you say you must be promoted this time?

47:26.134 --> 47:28.929
Without this, you're totally screwed

47:30.013 --> 47:30.889

47:33.684 --> 47:35.102
As long as you know

47:35.811 --> 47:37.938
Let’s talk about this plan

47:38.021 --> 47:40.440
Was it the Cao Ya public relations employee with no qualifications
who did it?

47:42.276 --> 47:45.612
The representative of Cao Ya PR worked in Serong before.

47:46.613 --> 47:50.409
When we were pitching proposals, I told her that
the finalist was already determined to be Global Communications

47:51.660 --> 47:52.995
Ask her not to have high expectations

47:54.663 --> 47:56.456
But it turned out like this

47:57.583 --> 48:01.086
-Why is it always so bad?
-because we made a mess

48:03.005 --> 48:05.340
Do you know the posts about Shi Yong in the Nonsense Forum ?

48:05.424 --> 48:06.925
Why is it always less than other companies?

48:07.801 --> 48:09.261
-Because everyone gave up?
-no

48:09.344 --> 48:10.679
It’s because what we do lets others know

48:10.762 --> 48:12.681
I really couldn’t hold my head up, so everyone couldn’t hold back from writing.

48:13.265 --> 48:14.141
I totally understand

48:18.812 --> 48:20.647
Don't call her "regardless of qualifications" anymore

48:21.064 --> 48:22.900
I want to call her Agent Park Yoon-so

48:23.775 --> 48:24.735
What?

48:25.694 --> 48:29.406
Yes, that’s right, I like her.
I’ve had a crush on her for a long time. Are you satisfied?

48:30.824 --> 48:31.783
What?

48:44.087 --> 48:46.590
So is the global communications team responsible for Sirdis' project ?

48:47.132 --> 48:48.050
Yes

48:48.133 --> 48:50.886
I heard that it is currently supervised by Representative Seo Donghun personally.

48:52.054 --> 48:52.888
Really?

48:54.890 --> 48:57.601
Who will be responsible for those three groups?

49:01.271 --> 49:02.648
I'm willing to give it a try

49:06.234 --> 49:07.402
you are not qualified yet

49:22.751 --> 49:24.836
It seems that I can only take responsibility personally.

49:26.588 --> 49:29.132
That’s why I ask that qualifications be taken into consideration when replacing people.

This plan…

49:37.265 --> 49:38.725
I said I'm responsible

49:40.519 --> 49:41.436
Any questions?

49:45.899 --> 49:46.858
No

49:48.026 --> 49:49.194
nothing

50:36.324 --> 50:39.161
About the Sildis Plan that Global Communications is responsible for

50:39.327 --> 50:41.246
That's actually the plan I made

50:41.788 --> 50:42.706
Then what?

50:44.291 --> 50:46.918
Please leave the Sildis plan to me.

50:47.836 --> 50:51.339
Please let me work on this project with Global Communications

50:54.384 --> 50:56.011
I am confident that I will do better than anyone else

50:56.094 --> 50:57.012
no

50:58.221 --> 51:00.307
Please familiarize yourself with your current job content first

51:01.308 --> 51:02.392
-Team Leader Chi
-You can get off work now

51:02.476 --> 51:03.560
Pool leader

51:03.643 --> 51:05.520
It only takes a few days to become familiar with the work content

51:05.604 --> 51:08.231
I've been doing digital PR in the past
so I'm familiar with

51:08.315 --> 51:10.817
-That plan...
-I said I'm in charge!

51:16.031 --> 51:17.991
This is an important project and I must be responsible for it

51:18.116 --> 51:19.242
How many times do you want me to speak?

51:21.620 --> 51:24.081
You said it only takes a few days to familiarize yourself with the work content?

51:24.831 --> 51:26.208
You said you've been doing it for a long time?

51:26.833 --> 51:27.834
Where is it done?

51:27.918 --> 51:30.879
Are they working for agencies whose names I've never even heard of ?

51:31.922 --> 51:34.257
Just because people like you
are neither powerful nor trustworthy

51:34.341 --> 51:37.135
We will distribute your plan
to the world, right?

51:37.594 --> 51:39.054
You should be ashamed

51:40.388 --> 51:41.348
How dare you do it casually...

51:42.933 --> 51:46.103
I have eight years of relevant work experience, team leader

51:46.978 --> 51:49.523
No one knows what you did in other companies during those eight years.

51:49.940 --> 51:52.901
Even if you have eight years of experience,
you may not be as good as Se Rong, a newcomer.

51:53.318 --> 51:57.322
As far as I'm concerned, there's no difference between you and that newcomer Ji Hyo.

51:57.989 --> 51:59.825
Do you understand your position now?

52:00.450 --> 52:04.454
I still don't agree that you are capable enough
to join Serong's public relations team.

52:11.795 --> 52:12.671
Agent Park

52:15.465 --> 52:16.967
Don’t cry in front of me again

52:17.384 --> 52:19.594
Never negotiate with tears

52:20.220 --> 52:21.346
That's the worst way

53:07.976 --> 53:09.978
