00:56.223 --> 00:57.474
You dropped this.

00:57.558 --> 00:58.726
"part 1"

01:05.274 --> 01:07.109
Please include a nice ribbon.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.696
Let's put up a sign.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.656
“Rooftop Movie Party with Lomocon”

01:12.740 --> 01:14.575
The right one is slightly higher.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.452
Yes, I understand.

01:16.535 --> 01:17.411
So be it.

01:39.224 --> 01:41.310
Yes, I am Park Yoon-joo from PR JoA.

01:41.393 --> 01:44.021
We rented 50 chairs
, but they haven't all arrived yet.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.106
- Manager
- Can you send it to me now?

01:46.190 --> 01:47.691
Wait a minute, what's going on?

01:47.775 --> 01:49.068
Come check this one out.

01:49.151 --> 01:50.861
About ten people are missing.

01:52.071 --> 01:53.280
No one sent it?

01:54.114 --> 01:55.532
Let the first person come...

01:58.827 --> 02:01.121
Uncle, go this way.

02:01.205 --> 02:04.291
Wait, uncle, don't leave yet.

02:04.374 --> 02:06.001
what are you doing here?

02:06.418 --> 02:08.128
No

02:08.212 --> 02:10.547
There are not enough chairs and no one delivers them.

02:10.672 --> 02:13.175
Li Zhejiang,
I don’t have time to chat now.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.052
There is definitely time.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.721
Look, 90% of our guests canceled.

02:19.473 --> 02:22.351
The chairs are more than adequate.

02:22.601 --> 02:24.228
what should I do?

02:24.645 --> 02:26.480
An absolute disaster.

02:28.816 --> 02:31.693
A classic movie from the 90s?
Definitely fits the retro theme.

02:31.777 --> 02:34.113
If no one is born in the 1990s,
what’s the point?

02:36.323 --> 02:37.991
Invite everyone you know. Li Zhe Zhang.

02:38.075 --> 02:40.119
Hey, look how nice the weather is.

02:40.786 --> 02:42.830
Do you think people will sleep at home?

02:42.913 --> 02:46.083
But we should call everyone who can.

02:47.876 --> 02:51.004
But why haven’t the new employees arrived yet?

02:51.463 --> 02:52.840
A student at Seoul National High School?

02:53.298 --> 02:54.341
I really do not understand.

02:54.424 --> 02:56.593
Graduated from Seoul National University. Why do you want to work here?

02:56.927 --> 02:58.220
Is it so hard to find a job now?

02:58.303 --> 03:02.683
What I don't understand is
why can't I see her here now?

03:08.313 --> 03:10.357
Where is Mr. Shin Ji-hyo now?

03:13.068 --> 03:14.528
- This
- This is Jihyo.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.446
Hello, please wait a moment.

03:18.448 --> 03:22.244
Hey, I told you.
Asking for leave before starting work

03:24.246 --> 03:26.665
No, the president has agreed.

03:27.249 --> 03:29.877
So "Park Yoon-joo" is not "nee"?

03:31.295 --> 03:32.337
OMG.

03:35.674 --> 03:37.634
Thank you, Manager Park Yoon-joo.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.720
Do you want me to leave now?

03:42.181 --> 03:43.682
How many people can I bring?

04:28.644 --> 04:29.645
- Hello
, welcome.

04:29.728 --> 04:31.104
- hello
- here

04:31.188 --> 04:32.981
- Nice to meet you. it's here.
- One by one.

04:33.065 --> 04:34.358
I'll show you around, so just follow along.

04:34.441 --> 04:35.317
Hello

04:35.400 --> 04:36.944
This is Lomocon...

04:37.903 --> 04:39.613
- Are you there yet?
- We haven't seen each other for a long time.

04:40.614 --> 04:43.116
-This is food. -Okay
, let's have a drink. Let's have a drink.

04:44.451 --> 04:45.452
Can't take pictures of me.

04:45.535 --> 04:46.536
Okay, I'll take pictures now.

04:49.539 --> 04:50.540
Joe

04:51.667 --> 04:54.586
Seriously, why is it taking so long?
I've been playing for hours.

04:54.670 --> 04:57.547
She is crazy.
Told me to close the bar so I could watch a movie.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.300
She has no customers anyway.
until 10 p.m.

05:00.884 --> 05:03.178
Hehe, the whole store is crowded with people.

05:03.262 --> 05:05.347
After the event I went to have dinner.
In your bar?

05:05.430 --> 05:06.807
Yes Yes.

05:06.890 --> 05:09.142
But shouldn't she take it out?

05:10.102 --> 05:12.104
People born in the 90s?

05:12.980 --> 05:14.564
Which

05:14.648 --> 05:16.400
Why can't I have you and me?

05:16.483 --> 05:17.567
We were born in 1990

05:17.651 --> 05:19.778
It's still the 90s.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.113
And one more thing...

05:21.196 --> 05:22.239
- Hello
.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.282
- Hello
- Hey.

05:23.782 --> 05:25.617
- let me see
- we look really good

05:25.701 --> 05:26.702
"Yun Qiao's sister. Ten years old."

05:26.785 --> 05:28.161
We look good. Let's take some more photos.

05:28.245 --> 05:30.414
- Come on
- Would you like to take a picture with me?

05:30.497 --> 05:31.957
"Yoon Joo's mother, 50 years old"

05:32.916 --> 05:34.710
“Yunjo is older than his first job,
in his 50s.”

05:37.129 --> 05:39.923
It's here and yes, more will be coming soon.

05:40.007 --> 05:40.966
Don't worry.

05:41.049 --> 05:41.925
“Customers over 40 years old”

05:42.009 --> 05:43.093
"President of Joa Public Relations Company,
40 years old"

05:43.176 --> 05:44.136
- Yes
- Are you sure?

05:44.219 --> 05:45.178
certainly.

05:45.262 --> 05:46.388
- That's...
- This way.

05:46.471 --> 05:47.306
Yes

05:47.389 --> 05:50.767
I can't believe we were able to drag people out here.
But none of them are in their 20s.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.270
Hey, Li Zhejiang,
let's do what we prepared.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.605
Last word challenge? Well, of course.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.441
Last word challenge?

05:58.483 --> 06:00.444
"Challenge 'The Last Word' with Lomocon"

06:02.404 --> 06:03.488
Post-90s

06:04.114 --> 06:07.200
This is a job suitable for young people in their 20s and early 30s.

06:07.784 --> 06:10.787
We'll take pictures in front of the body
along with the last words

06:10.871 --> 06:13.498
"I want to donate my property.
Create a value of hundreds of billions for society."

06:13.582 --> 06:15.876
Can you send this? Look, Haejonie.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.503
But there’s nothing sad or depressing about it at all.

06:18.587 --> 06:21.006
This is a lighthearted last word challenge.

06:21.089 --> 06:23.342
The key is that it has to be easy.

06:23.425 --> 06:25.385
Only those born in the 1990s
can do this.

06:25.469 --> 06:27.804
Hey, if you cry again I'll kill you.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.973
I've had enough

06:30.057 --> 06:31.016
"I've had enough, but here it comes again."

06:31.975 --> 06:33.727
"Let's fall in love again in the next life.
Men are the best."

06:36.355 --> 06:38.231
Love is the best.

06:40.192 --> 06:41.943
Gee, why does she look so stressed?

06:42.027 --> 06:42.861
That's it.

06:47.324 --> 06:50.410
"Sorry, but I'm really dying."

06:51.411 --> 06:53.372
"I'm so happy to have you in my life."

06:54.539 --> 06:55.374
What's this?

06:56.083 --> 06:57.834
I want this photo.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.212
I really had to use photos of dead bodies.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.381
Why are you talking about corpse pictures here?

07:02.464 --> 07:03.298
everyone

07:03.799 --> 07:06.343
I'm happy because of them.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.430
I often hang out with them.

07:16.395 --> 07:17.229
Thanks.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.481
- She was really crying.
- What?

07:20.982 --> 07:24.277
- What's up with her?
- she...

07:24.611 --> 07:26.488
- I can't believe it.
- What did you say?

07:27.072 --> 07:29.950
- What happened?
- Why didn't you tell me right away?

07:30.033 --> 07:31.284
- Why?
- what happened?

07:31.368 --> 07:32.536
this

07:32.619 --> 07:33.912
Things get really weird.

07:33.995 --> 07:35.580
Because I know what's going to happen

07:36.832 --> 07:40.502
No, we are in this together.
We will die together.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.045
This isn't fair.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.131
Here, step back.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.508
Drink until you are completely drunk.

07:47.342 --> 07:48.468
- Pour it for me.
- Please show me the way.

07:48.552 --> 07:49.511
That!

07:49.594 --> 07:51.346
- here are our drinks
- here

07:51.847 --> 07:53.473
- There will be many things in life
- Soju has arrived.

07:54.558 --> 07:57.018
It's like glass.

07:57.102 --> 07:59.980
- Empty glass, fill it.
- Empty glass, fill it.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.148
If the cup is empty, fill it.

08:01.231 --> 08:02.357
uncle

08:02.983 --> 08:04.734
Turn the volume down a little. We are watching a movie together.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.278
- Noisy
- What's wrong?

08:06.361 --> 08:08.864
- If you want a drink go to a bar
- here

08:08.947 --> 08:11.074
- Let's watch a movie.
- What did you say?

08:11.158 --> 08:12.951
- Shut up
...

08:13.034 --> 08:14.035
- Hey
- stop.

08:14.119 --> 08:15.704
- What?
- No.

08:15.787 --> 08:17.664
- I'm sorry
- What did you say?

08:18.081 --> 08:20.000
- Believe it or not
- let the kid go.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.043
This guy has no manners at all.

08:22.127 --> 08:24.296
Hey, don't cry.

08:24.754 --> 08:27.424
There will be many things in life.
Enjoy every moment until death is enough.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.176
Damn it, be quiet.

08:29.259 --> 08:30.427
It's not just you.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.595
Let's watch movies together.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.889
I just found out today
that my friend is dying

08:33.972 --> 08:36.266
Didn't you see we were watching a movie?

08:36.349 --> 08:38.185
- Sorry
- Hey

08:38.268 --> 08:41.480
- It's not just you here.
- Let me watch the movie

08:41.563 --> 08:43.482
- I'm sorry
- Damn it

09:08.715 --> 09:11.051
Like countless photos
in my memory

09:11.801 --> 09:16.932
I know that as time goes by,
love will eventually become a memory

09:19.392 --> 09:22.354
But you will never become a memory

09:24.105 --> 09:27.526
Because of you, I can leave with the love in my heart.

09:28.026 --> 09:30.070
I want to thank you for this.

09:44.376 --> 09:48.171
“#90s电影
#augustchristmas#moviemovie”

09:48.255 --> 09:49.839
“#filmcamera#lastwordchallenge”

09:49.923 --> 09:51.967
"#lastwordchallenge# was born in the 1990s"

09:55.011 --> 09:56.638
Don't include "born in the 1990s" at all.

09:57.222 --> 09:59.391
There are three of us,
you, me and Li Zhezhang.

09:59.474 --> 10:02.519
But none of them are in their 20s, and that's the problem.

10:04.646 --> 10:06.064
But it's still profound.

10:06.565 --> 10:08.149
But you're not reassured, right?

10:08.233 --> 10:09.442
not at all

10:10.777 --> 10:12.737
Should I change the name of the challenge?

10:13.196 --> 10:15.657
Not "last words of comfort"
post-90s generation"

10:15.740 --> 10:17.534
But are they “the true last words of all generations”?

10:17.617 --> 10:19.869
- Can you change it?
- No, you can't change it.

10:22.038 --> 10:24.916
The customers are only from the post-90s generation.

10:25.834 --> 10:27.961
Seriously,
is this called a promotion?

10:28.044 --> 10:29.087
- Miss, I'm sorry
- Oh my God.

10:29.170 --> 10:30.922
No, don't stop me.

10:31.006 --> 10:32.507
- Back off
- I won't stop you.

10:32.591 --> 10:34.467
- Needless to say
- I won't stop you.

10:34.551 --> 10:36.845
- I didn't touch you at all
- Damn, today...

10:45.020 --> 10:46.354
damn it.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.377
can you accept?

11:09.461 --> 11:10.712
But I'm a fast bowler.

11:10.795 --> 11:12.714
- Good throw
- Wow.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.716
- Do you play baseball?
- I'll ask.

11:14.799 --> 11:17.052
- I want popcorn
- Yes, I just made it this morning.

11:17.135 --> 11:18.511
- Why is it so delicious
? - Right?

11:18.595 --> 11:20.513
- For your next job...
- Make delicious popcorn.

11:26.603 --> 11:30.482
The Seoul National University freshman turned off his phone.
And in the end it didn't show up at all.

11:30.565 --> 11:31.524
WHO？

11:32.275 --> 11:33.109
a child

11:34.569 --> 11:35.737
Drink.

11:36.988 --> 11:38.657
I don't even deserve a drink.

11:38.740 --> 11:42.369
Who said there would be a party?
After finishing the work here

11:46.623 --> 11:48.041
You have to drink.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.545
Yeah, I'll drink it all.

11:52.629 --> 11:53.505
very good

11:59.678 --> 12:00.845
Damn it

12:05.850 --> 12:07.060
too delicious

12:07.519 --> 12:10.230
Hey, why didn't Jimin come?

12:10.313 --> 12:11.690
She also played his favorite movies.

12:12.023 --> 12:13.358
He went camping.

12:13.692 --> 12:15.985
I've been seeing a lot of this lately.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.696
Are you camping alone?

12:17.779 --> 12:18.613
have no idea

12:18.697 --> 12:20.949
Maybe he's hiding his girlfriend, who knows?

12:22.784 --> 12:24.869
I should live like Jaemin.

12:24.953 --> 12:27.372
Don't they work in the same line of work?
Have you met him?

12:27.956 --> 12:29.416
No, never once.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.836
He works in the public relations department of a large company.
Top of the food chain

12:33.294 --> 12:36.131
I work for a small company.
bottom of food chain

12:37.257 --> 12:38.675
This is a brutally racist society.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.804
Damn, there's so much going on, I want to drink it.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.269
This is too strong. Give me some soju.

12:49.394 --> 12:50.645
- This would be better, right?
- oh.

12:52.313 --> 12:53.148
here it is.

13:13.418 --> 13:15.587
"Cui Huiying"

13:21.468 --> 13:24.471
Who is this
? My favorite reporter Choi.

13:24.637 --> 13:25.597
very happy

13:25.680 --> 13:26.723
where

13:27.807 --> 13:28.641
I'm not in Seoul.

13:29.392 --> 13:30.435
Good night

13:30.518 --> 13:32.353
"Daguo Daily"

13:32.437 --> 13:34.439
I'm sending a file.
Open it now and take a look.

13:36.941 --> 13:39.444
"Cui Huiying"

13:40.862 --> 13:42.489
Changing the manufacturer of Seyon in "Choi Hye Young: Bribery Auction" ? "

"Bribery auction to
replace Seyon's manufacturer?"

13:43.907 --> 13:45.575
"Read all"

13:45.658 --> 13:48.495

Not Company B..."

13:52.540 --> 13:55.126
"I suspect bribery.
Change the manufacturer to Company A"

14:03.843 --> 14:05.386
It's up to you, isn't it?

14:05.470 --> 14:08.181
If you can't,
I'll pretend you didn't call me.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.308
At least I can enjoy the weekend.

14:10.892 --> 14:13.561
- Didn't you cry when you saw the coffin?
- Can you turn off the news?

14:13.645 --> 14:16.231
Check out my post.
He knew that we graduated from the same university.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.902
- That means you want us to cover up the news
- You're addicted to alcohol

14:29.202 --> 14:30.662
Come on, bug manager.

14:31.246 --> 14:33.873
Manager Meng, please answer the phone quickly.

14:33.957 --> 14:36.543
Did you get drunk a little too quickly?

14:40.171 --> 14:42.799
Hey Brother Zhejun, I just sent you the file.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.885
I think you should tell your boss first.

14:45.969 --> 14:50.139
I...I just got home...

14:50.223 --> 14:52.600
- Go to sleep, go to sleep
- I'm dizzy...

14:53.184 --> 14:54.477
Yes

14:54.978 --> 14:56.521
- Oh
- Go home and sleep.

14:57.021 --> 14:59.315

15:21.504 --> 15:23.047
Oh, why are you here alone?

15:23.923 --> 15:24.924
Where is Zhejun?

15:27.051 --> 15:28.219
He is not in good health.

15:28.303 --> 15:29.512
You bastard!

15:36.394 --> 15:38.646
A reporter from Daguo Daily came to Zaile?

15:38.730 --> 15:39.606
Yes

15:40.106 --> 15:41.566
I've never heard of this name before.

15:42.317 --> 15:43.484
who told you that?

15:44.277 --> 15:46.362
Reporter Choi Hye-young
graduated from the same university

15:46.446 --> 15:48.072
Yes, Director Zhang.

15:48.156 --> 15:51.159
Oh, sorry to bother you so early in the morning.

15:51.242 --> 15:53.036
I won't bother you if it's not necessary.

15:53.119 --> 15:56.247
How is this going? What happened to the reporter?

15:56.331 --> 15:58.625
He had me running around.
It's the weekend.

15:59.584 --> 16:00.668
Ah right?

16:01.502 --> 16:03.463
I think he's a little too enthusiastic.

16:04.756 --> 16:08.009
That said, we will check the facts.

16:08.092 --> 16:10.094
But Monday is too early, right?

16:10.553 --> 16:11.512
oh!

16:11.930 --> 16:14.015
I didn't ask you
to stop posting about this.

16:14.265 --> 16:17.018
You have to find out the facts.
and listen to some stories around us

16:18.853 --> 16:20.897
Yes, yes, golf sounds good.

16:21.022 --> 16:24.651
Was the previous session good?
I will make an appointment and call you back.

16:24.734 --> 16:26.402
Yes Yes.

this afternoon

16:30.365 --> 16:31.783
Go find a reporter.

16:32.408 --> 16:33.826
Go find out what that bastard wants.

16:33.910 --> 16:35.787
I made a lot of phone calls.
Both parties send messages

16:35.870 --> 16:37.080
But he didn't answer at all.

16:37.163 --> 16:38.247
He seemed to be avoiding me.

16:38.957 --> 16:40.375
He really wanted to talk to this big guy.

16:42.835 --> 16:43.878
I'll keep calling.

16:44.629 --> 16:46.130

16:46.214 --> 16:48.257
"Corruption is still rampant.
Is it in the company?"

16:48.341 --> 16:51.678
Its purpose is to use a negative word.

16:53.554 --> 16:55.264
Damn that bastard.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.034
He should have arrived.

There are no problems at the Changwon factory.

17:37.265 --> 17:39.434
Who is the manager there?
He was interviewed here.

17:39.517 --> 17:42.478
I have read this article.
He didn't say much.

17:43.312 --> 17:46.107
It doesn't work anymore.
Go see the factory director.

17:47.358 --> 17:49.277
Have you gone to Changwon?

17:49.360 --> 17:50.528

But if I were living in Changwon and reporters came...

18:01.372 --> 18:02.790
Why don't you answer the phone?

18:03.708 --> 18:06.836
If he accepts, do I have to fly back to Seoul?

18:07.503 --> 18:08.546
Yes

Any questions? Don't you understand what I'm saying?

18:15.636 --> 18:18.097

But I didn't say anything bad.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.057
I'm not talking about using power.
in the wrong way

19:01.140 --> 19:03.226
I told you
this was a normal interview.

19:06.270 --> 19:08.272
They may lie to you.
There are a lot of questions, and that’s great.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.052
I'll check again.

- Yes, Reporter Park
- We lost contact during the game yesterday.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.636
What he said in that interview
is not true...

23:48.719 --> 23:51.263
Hey, they fired me
because I couldn't work on the holidays.

23:51.347 --> 23:52.848
This is against labor laws.

23:54.517 --> 23:55.351
Anyway

23:55.434 --> 23:58.437
I thought they solved this problem with seminar tickets.
This is from the president of Daguo Daily.

23:58.521 --> 24:00.064
I might want more.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.775
Isn’t that 4 million won per ticket?

24:03.359 --> 24:05.194
Hey, those slimy reporters.

24:12.034 --> 24:13.828
Yes, I'm listening. bring it on.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.872
Probably around noon.

24:17.498 --> 24:19.708
We will send you a statement.
As for other questions...

24:19.792 --> 24:23.087
- I heard you went to Changwon
- Yes

24:23.170 --> 24:25.714
What did the factory director say?
Is it during the interview?

24:27.049 --> 24:28.134
That doesn't seem to be the case.

24:29.093 --> 24:29.927
So what does it look like?

24:30.010 --> 24:32.054
Protein ingredient manufacturers have changed.

24:32.138 --> 24:34.807
But like previous manufacturers,
they will provide false information to reporters.

24:37.435 --> 24:38.394
Very original script

24:42.731 --> 24:46.485
I slept with my ex-wife, what should I do?

24:46.652 --> 24:47.611
Ha, this idiot.

24:47.695 --> 24:48.737
You are the manager.

24:49.363 --> 24:51.282
can you hear me? Speak softly.

24:51.365 --> 24:52.366
I heard it all.

24:54.410 --> 24:55.786

25:03.711 --> 25:05.296
Yes, I'll give it to you now.

25:05.379 --> 25:06.505
hurry up.

25:19.643 --> 25:20.686
It's about the new kids.

25:21.270 --> 25:22.938
Have you been missing since Saturday?

25:23.647 --> 25:25.149
Didn't you call back at all?

25:25.232 --> 25:26.066
Yes

25:26.150 --> 25:28.110
To this day, he still hasn't called.

25:29.487 --> 25:33.365
Obviously, I don't want to work here.

25:33.449 --> 25:36.035
But it's impossible to go on like this, isn't it?

25:36.118 --> 25:37.453
Just a rude kid

25:37.536 --> 25:40.039
I already know that it won't be long before
it all ends here.

25:40.706 --> 25:43.083
I hope students can graduate from Seoul National University.
You can't come to work in a place like this.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.127
This is Li Zhenjiang.

25:46.253 --> 25:47.630
It doesn't sound right.

25:47.713 --> 25:49.298
Why do you need to mention your university?

25:51.050 --> 25:53.677
So is there anything bad here? why?

25:53.761 --> 25:56.764
No, it's okay, I'm just saying.

25:59.934 --> 26:00.809
Not working

26:03.479 --> 26:06.023
What makes you think that?
This time, she'll answer the phone.

26:07.775 --> 26:12.780
Please leave a message after the beep.
Then press the star or square button

26:14.782 --> 26:18.035
Mr. Shin Ji Hyo, I am

26:18.118 --> 26:19.495
You never called me back.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.789
As far as I know,
this is how you announced your resignation.

26:21.872 --> 26:24.041
But work is not fun.

26:24.792 --> 26:25.793
if you want to resign

26:25.876 --> 26:27.628
Learn to be polite and put people in perspective.

26:27.711 --> 26:29.964
You are of the same generation.
My reputation is completely ruined.

26:30.965 --> 26:32.132
That last sentence is pretty cool.

26:35.511 --> 26:37.763
"Shin Ji Hyo"

26:49.233 --> 26:50.359
What's wrong?

26:51.569 --> 26:53.529
It's okay, don't worry.

26:54.071 --> 26:55.072
It doesn't matter.

26:55.990 --> 26:57.575
Those two people...

26:58.742 --> 27:00.536
- Mr. Shin Ji-hyo...
- Let me start.

27:01.328 --> 27:04.039
I have informed the President that I am on leave.

27:04.123 --> 27:05.791
I never disobeyed you for a moment.

27:05.874 --> 27:08.294
So why don't you answer the phone?

27:08.377 --> 27:10.212
You can leave a message here.

27:10.296 --> 27:13.299
I have the right not to answer the phone.
This has to do with holiday work.

27:13.382 --> 27:14.300
Mr. Shin Ji-hyo

27:14.883 --> 27:19.388
As you can see, this is not a large company.
We can never have enough people.

27:19.722 --> 27:23.726
And you know deep down that
we're going to be hosting the event on the weekend

27:23.809 --> 27:27.438
And your job is to take care of the guests.

27:28.314 --> 27:30.482
You keep saying the same thing over and over again.

27:30.566 --> 27:33.235
I have informed the president.
I got off work that day

27:33.319 --> 27:34.528
You are not interested here.

27:34.612 --> 27:36.196
Don't talk to me in that tone.

27:36.780 --> 27:39.366
I'm still your boss.

27:39.450 --> 27:41.160
Why did you act so unreasonably?

27:42.161 --> 27:43.120
Or maybe it's because...

27:43.203 --> 27:45.581
This is a small company.
So you have no common sense.

27:49.627 --> 27:51.754
not flexible...

27:51.837 --> 27:54.048
This is a benefit.
of this small company.

27:54.131 --> 27:55.174
unlike big companies

27:55.257 --> 27:57.509
If not,
what's the point of continuing to work here?

27:57.593 --> 27:59.136
Work-life balance
And the pay isn't great either.

27:59.219 --> 28:01.305
- Then you don't have to do it.
- I definitely won't.

28:01.388 --> 28:03.641
Why am I resigning from today?

28:14.026 --> 28:14.902
Mr. Shin Ji-hyo

28:15.486 --> 28:17.529
Sorry I forgot to tell...

28:17.613 --> 28:22.159
Manager Park and Lee Chul-jung, please
explain that you are on vacation.

28:23.327 --> 28:24.453
Yes

28:27.623 --> 28:28.666
Yes, it is...

28:30.334 --> 28:32.836
If you say you want to resign, I won't back down.

28:32.920 --> 28:34.463
But it's about balancing life with work
and salary.

28:34.546 --> 28:38.092
If you don't like anything else, you can tell me.

28:38.175 --> 28:39.968
I thought...

28:40.552 --> 28:43.222
Looking for a way to grow...

28:43.305 --> 28:46.225
My future small company

28:46.558 --> 28:47.601
Do you really want to hear it?

28:48.602 --> 28:49.436
Yes

28:52.231 --> 28:56.527
I believe in having talented employees.
This is even more important for small companies.

28:56.610 --> 29:00.948
You should hire better people.
Your company will be able to compete with other companies.

29:03.659 --> 29:05.536
What’s the point of working all night?

29:05.619 --> 29:08.872
You don't have enough people to do it.
Even a viral marketing project.

29:08.956 --> 29:09.998
The efficiency is too low

29:11.458 --> 29:12.668
This is a human resources issue.

29:13.544 --> 29:15.796
Moreover,
there are only a few employees here.

29:15.879 --> 29:19.508
Let’s just call each other cool.
That'll be fun.

29:19.591 --> 29:22.136
In fact, her name is Li Zhejiang.

29:22.886 --> 29:25.681
Have been working here for a week.
Don't you know about this?

29:25.764 --> 29:26.974
This is just a small company.

29:33.564 --> 29:35.816
As far as I can see

29:36.358 --> 29:40.112
Manager Park and Lee Cheol Jung are both good.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.489
Do you think so?

29:43.073 --> 29:46.118
Well, everyone has different standards.

29:47.161 --> 29:49.872
Mr. Shin Ji-hyo thinks
what makes employees...

29:50.539 --> 29:51.540
You are a talented person.

29:52.249 --> 29:55.085
I don't know anything else.

29:55.419 --> 29:58.589
But probably not someone I don’t know.
Balance life and work

29:58.672 --> 30:00.257
Work-life balance
This is a personal value.

30:00.340 --> 30:02.134
This is not something that can be used to measure ability.

30:02.217 --> 30:04.928
I'm only giving my opinion because you asked.

30:05.429 --> 30:07.765
I will not discuss or argue with you.

30:07.848 --> 30:08.724
Mr. Shin Ji-hyo

30:08.807 --> 30:10.559
Can I still leave?

30:22.237 --> 30:24.948
I bet my life
she finds a job somewhere else

30:25.532 --> 30:27.159
You don't have to do this.

30:27.785 --> 30:29.661
Really, I don't want to believe it.

30:49.223 --> 30:50.641
“Party on the Lomocon Rooftop”

30:57.606 --> 31:00.025
What's wrong with today's children?

31:00.234 --> 31:02.236
- Do you understand them?
- Are you a monk or something?

31:02.319 --> 31:03.153
"Corporation: Conservatives"

31:03.237 --> 31:04.488
who I am?

31:04.988 --> 31:05.989
wait for me?

31:06.073 --> 31:07.991
Everything the child said was right.

31:08.992 --> 31:11.453
She thought she had informed the president.
Isn't this okay?

31:11.537 --> 31:14.122
The girl turned off her phone. Do your job for me.

31:14.456 --> 31:18.168
Who asks for leave?
Start with the first week of your new job.

31:18.252 --> 31:19.294
Can't you?

31:19.878 --> 31:21.630
you can not.

31:22.047 --> 31:23.966
You might not know this
because I've never worked in a company.

31:24.049 --> 31:25.509
But it can't do that.

31:25.592 --> 31:28.428
If there is an emergency, you can take a day off.
What's the big deal?

31:28.512 --> 31:29.429
Quiet.

31:30.097 --> 31:31.515
OK

31:33.475 --> 31:34.434
You know what?

31:34.518 --> 31:36.186
I will win this upcoming project.

31:37.646 --> 31:40.691
That girl gave me fire.
and feel like winning

31:41.441 --> 31:43.318
She looks down on me.

31:43.485 --> 31:45.737
I understand what you want to drink.

31:46.488 --> 31:49.157
This is a billion dollar project.
Serong Cosmetics

31:49.241 --> 31:50.868
- Seyong
- What are you drinking?

31:51.577 --> 31:52.703
What is no padding?

31:53.745 --> 31:56.456
I just do whatever needs to be done.
He put it on the news anyway.

31:56.540 --> 31:58.584
He did not break the news.
So we can turn off the news

31:58.667 --> 32:00.210
He wanted to talk to someone at boss level.

32:00.294 --> 32:02.254
How does he know prices will rise again?

32:03.589 --> 32:04.756
bad

32:05.215 --> 32:07.217
What do we need in a moment like this?

32:07.551 --> 32:09.094
- Alcohol?
- That's right.

32:10.387 --> 32:11.430
Tan Tan

32:11.513 --> 32:13.307
"Utopia"

32:14.391 --> 32:16.351
- "Tho"?
- Cool name, right?

32:22.608 --> 32:23.567
a while.

32:58.852 --> 33:00.812
Oh, I was totally shocked.

33:01.939 --> 33:03.231
Put my head back in place.

33:03.941 --> 33:04.983
able

33:07.277 --> 33:08.403
five degrees to the left

33:08.487 --> 33:09.613
left...

33:11.615 --> 33:12.824
OK

33:14.785 --> 33:15.869
damn it.

33:16.578 --> 33:17.496
I was completely shocked.

33:17.579 --> 33:18.664
same

33:18.747 --> 33:19.581
Are you shocked?

33:21.458 --> 33:22.417
Damn it

33:24.336 --> 33:25.170
Oh, indeed.

33:25.671 --> 33:26.505
this

33:27.631 --> 33:28.882
welcome

33:29.299 --> 33:30.258
Hello

33:31.218 --> 33:32.427
Please sit here.

33:32.511 --> 33:33.762
- thank you
- right here

33:35.263 --> 33:38.058
All three of them are in primary school.
Or the same middle school?

33:38.141 --> 33:39.059
- Yes
Yes.

33:39.601 --> 33:41.812
I'm tired of them.

33:43.981 --> 33:46.942
Reporter Choi graduated from college.
Is it the same as Jaemin?

33:47.776 --> 33:49.486
Your academic performance must be very good.

33:50.112 --> 33:50.946
not at all.

33:51.029 --> 33:54.074
Actually we were just chatting.
Your college junior will go on his own.

33:55.283 --> 33:56.451
What's wrong?

33:56.535 --> 33:57.953
They are all children these days

33:58.620 --> 34:00.622
I see.

34:00.706 --> 34:02.708
I see new employees at work who are in their early 20s.

34:02.791 --> 34:04.710
I thought:
"I've never been like this."

34:05.585 --> 34:06.795
Is it right?

34:07.379 --> 34:09.172
The worst thing is they don't answer the phone.

34:09.756 --> 34:10.632
that's right.

34:11.216 --> 34:12.926
Never picked up the phone.

34:13.176 --> 34:16.221
Some people just send messages.
Don't answer the phone either.

34:16.430 --> 34:17.472
Did you hear it?

34:17.681 --> 34:19.433
I just called someone.

34:19.516 --> 34:20.851
- Very important thing
- Yes.

34:20.934 --> 34:23.395
But she kept messaging me.
Don't answer my calls at all.

34:23.478 --> 34:25.647
- Do you get me?
- What nonsense.

34:25.731 --> 34:26.815
Hey, go away.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.150
- Ha
- What next?

34:28.233 --> 34:29.067
- Why...
- So I...

34:29.151 --> 34:29.985
- Change place?
- Yes.

34:30.694 --> 34:33.196
- There's a typhoon coming now, right?
- Yes.

34:33.280 --> 34:36.199
- You should answer the phone. The matter is urgent
- yes.

34:36.283 --> 34:37.951
She doesn't answer my calls. continue sending messages

34:38.035 --> 34:40.078
Damn it, why are you doing this?

34:40.162 --> 34:41.455
- Hey, you understand...
- Yeah.

34:41.955 --> 34:43.749
Yes, can you give me your business card?

34:43.832 --> 34:45.500
Can you give me your business card?

34:45.584 --> 34:48.003
"Open test consent form
and restore safety"

34:54.634 --> 34:56.720
OK, everything is ready.

35:09.357 --> 35:10.400
What's this?

35:11.109 --> 35:12.778
free.

35:14.488 --> 35:16.531
Looks better than the real product.

35:16.907 --> 35:18.825
That's the beauty of free stuff.

35:18.909 --> 35:19.785
It's irresistible.

35:21.036 --> 35:21.870
This is real.

35:22.537 --> 35:25.540
Of course, I'm always right.

35:25.665 --> 35:26.833
Yes Yes.

35:26.917 --> 35:28.335
let's go.

35:31.588 --> 35:32.464
Miss Huajia

35:33.256 --> 35:35.383
Why didn't I go to a regular high school?

35:36.551 --> 35:38.637
What the hell are you talking about?

35:40.347 --> 35:43.266
Mr. Huazi won't let me study, will he?

35:43.850 --> 35:47.062
He said he wanted me to make money.
Immediately after high school graduation

35:48.063 --> 35:50.816
He went to study for a vocational certificate because he wanted to work immediately.

35:50.899 --> 35:51.900
Why do you blame me?

35:51.983 --> 35:54.111
- I?
- Yes, that's you.

35:56.279 --> 35:59.032
At that time, Uncle Byung-gil
had just been diagnosed with cancer.

35:59.116 --> 36:00.033
we need money

36:00.117 --> 36:01.827
You see, you chose it yourself.

36:06.248 --> 36:07.124
The elevator is rising.

36:12.254 --> 36:14.589
I wouldn't be surprised if the elevator fell down now.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.884
No one is forcing
us to move to this dilapidated building.

36:18.885 --> 36:20.303
He is about to develop a new product here.

36:21.054 --> 36:22.556
We are leasing him.

36:22.639 --> 36:24.975
Even if you create a new one
it's none of our business.

36:25.058 --> 36:28.103
The deposit is so cheap.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.646
I didn't think about this at all.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.149
I'm the one who paid the deposit.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.656
So why are you talking about high school?

36:39.739 --> 36:41.032
It ended a long time ago.

36:41.116 --> 36:42.117
there is nothing

36:43.118 --> 36:45.328
I just want to know if I studied in an ordinary high school...

36:45.412 --> 36:47.372
Would my life be different than it is now?

36:47.455 --> 36:48.415
Why is life now?

36:50.792 --> 36:52.419
This is good.

36:52.711 --> 36:54.504
But I keep getting asked.

36:54.588 --> 36:55.505
It's very annoying.

36:56.131 --> 36:57.090
What does it mean?

36:57.215 --> 36:59.426
Don't be too vague.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.475
Obviously, I'm not a smart person.

37:09.436 --> 37:10.604
Did the president speak?

37:10.812 --> 37:11.813
No, that's not right.

37:12.397 --> 37:13.940
Speech by new employee who resigned

37:14.191 --> 37:15.609
What would she know?

37:16.693 --> 37:17.903
that's right.

37:18.528 --> 37:21.281
She may look down on you.
Because you can graduate from college online.

37:22.449 --> 37:24.534
Is it you Huajia?

37:24.701 --> 37:26.203
alright.

37:27.537 --> 37:28.538
Isn't it?

37:31.333 --> 37:32.459
Is it right?

37:33.627 --> 37:35.712
But talking about online college

37:36.129 --> 37:38.298
I didn’t even get a student loan.

37:38.381 --> 37:40.342
I work to make money for myself.

37:40.425 --> 37:43.053
Since working in accounting
until now I started working in public relations.

37:43.136 --> 37:45.055
Do you think it's easy?

37:45.430 --> 37:48.683
I changed jobs when I was 20 years old.

37:48.767 --> 37:49.809
real

37:49.893 --> 37:52.479
I don’t know how many 20-year-olds there are.
Who doesn’t know what they want to do.

37:52.562 --> 37:54.648
What you do is amazing.

37:55.315 --> 37:57.525
I work hard too.

38:01.947 --> 38:04.658
So why is my life so miserable?

38:04.741 --> 38:07.327
I only have my daughter to support me.

38:07.410 --> 38:09.246
Use your own money
to pay the deposit.

38:09.329 --> 38:10.914
Only 30 million won.

38:12.207 --> 38:13.333
that is because...

38:13.416 --> 38:15.794
Mr. Huajia always spends his money on stupid things.

38:16.419 --> 38:19.714
Hey, I spend my money
on the people I love and the people I love.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.341
Where is the waste?

38:21.424 --> 38:22.509
Damn it

38:24.594 --> 38:25.428
A man?

38:26.137 --> 38:28.181
Men are different.

38:28.598 --> 38:30.767
This is my life my man

38:32.435 --> 38:35.105
This is my cup, I bought it.

38:35.939 --> 38:38.191
How narrow-minded.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.110
Just a glass of soju

38:41.236 --> 38:42.570
《Seyuu》

38:42.654 --> 38:43.488
Is that me?

38:43.571 --> 38:44.948
Yes, sir.

38:45.699 --> 38:47.617
Do you mean starting a company?

38:49.327 --> 38:50.829
The manager is responsible.

38:51.621 --> 38:53.999
Yes, usually the manager
is responsible

38:54.082 --> 38:56.501
But he seems very busy lately.

38:56.584 --> 38:58.003
So I helped lighten the load for him.

38:58.837 --> 39:01.214
Or you might have to take all the work away from him.

39:01.589 --> 39:03.174
If he was going to do anything
he wouldn't let it go.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.385
When you piss him off, it's all over.

39:06.636 --> 39:08.179
Why does he have to be like this?

39:08.263 --> 39:12.142
Calm down and come back.
Let us take responsibility for this again.

39:12.225 --> 39:13.685
I was overloaded with work just now.

39:13.768 --> 39:17.188
You know, if I don't get promoted,
I have to quit.

39:17.272 --> 39:20.275
Because of this, I should take my job back.

39:20.525 --> 39:22.694
You have to do something.
To be evaluated

39:22.777 --> 39:25.405
Except drinking with reporters.

39:25.780 --> 39:26.740
So what went wrong?

39:26.823 --> 39:29.242
That’s what PR people do.

39:29.492 --> 39:30.744
It's work.

39:30.827 --> 39:32.996
Times have changed.

39:33.079 --> 39:36.041
- Only the manager doesn't know
- Yeah, I don't know

39:36.124 --> 39:37.375
I don't want to know anything anymore.

39:40.462 --> 39:41.504
Oh, Chief Elf.

39:41.588 --> 39:42.839
a while.

39:44.049 --> 39:45.342
This is Director G.

39:45.425 --> 39:47.052
Is today’s digital world safe?

39:47.135 --> 39:48.303
shut your mouth

39:51.931 --> 39:53.266
Crazy cool

39:56.019 --> 39:57.312
We started working here together.

39:57.604 --> 39:59.689
But she became the head of the department.
Be a team leader

40:00.273 --> 40:01.900
Knowing this, I should probably go to the digital department.

40:02.025 --> 40:03.526
Who drinks with reporters these days?

40:03.610 --> 40:05.779
Hey, you old-school PR guy.

40:08.198 --> 40:09.741
This is the information provided for bidding on this work.
Is it cosmetics?

40:10.200 --> 40:12.786
It says "Auction"
but the winner has already been chosen.

40:14.412 --> 40:15.663
You know who this is.

40:17.415 --> 40:18.583

40:18.666 --> 40:19.542
Yes

40:20.085 --> 40:21.211
"PR Joea"

40:25.090 --> 40:29.761
It won't be like
a regular cosmetics ad

40:30.387 --> 40:32.680
while still conveying the essence

40:32.931 --> 40:35.975
This would be a clever advertisement. people can visit

40:36.518 --> 40:40.855
We plan to invite influencers.
Focus on beauty influencers

40:40.939 --> 40:45.944
Go to publicity jobs and do various challenges
in order to attract users...

40:50.698 --> 40:51.699
how

40:51.783 --> 40:54.202
I don't think it's necessary to come here.

A cup of sweet latte

40:58.873 --> 41:00.250
- Have an iced Americano
- American...

41:02.210 --> 41:03.962
- Sigh
- But what happened?

41:06.631 --> 41:07.632
Sane's introduction?

41:08.383 --> 41:09.217
do you know?

41:09.300 --> 41:11.970
I think she still doesn't know.
But I work there.

41:12.595 --> 41:13.721
There is also a public relations department

41:14.472 --> 41:16.641
Guess who does the demo?

41:17.392 --> 41:18.393
you?

41:19.144 --> 41:21.729
So can I use some wire?
Choose mine.

41:21.813 --> 41:25.024
Oh, this depends on strength.
The level of deputy manager is too high

41:26.317 --> 41:28.862
Come, please give me a glass of sweet wine.
I need to add some sugar.

41:31.990 --> 41:32.866
Thanks

41:35.118 --> 41:38.037
Alas, if only I had been so diligent in high school.

41:38.121 --> 41:39.372
Maybe got into Harvard.

41:45.003 --> 41:46.421
Maybe I should...

41:47.213 --> 41:48.882
It actually says "auction."

41:48.965 --> 41:50.633
But the winner has already been chosen.

41:50.717 --> 41:52.218
- Earth communications?
- Yes.

42:00.477 --> 42:03.146
Other PR Agencies
Don’t you know this?

42:03.229 --> 42:04.647
You must not know.

42:12.071 --> 42:14.449
That's all? Boss Song is here again.

42:15.325 --> 42:18.244
Damn, it’s been ten years.
But he still didn't let go.

Smoke billowed from her head.

42:39.682 --> 42:41.351
Hey, wait a minute.

That

43:10.129 --> 43:11.297
are you ready?

43:11.381 --> 43:12.674
I haven't played for a long time, let's go.

43:12.757 --> 43:13.716
OK

43:39.284 --> 43:40.868
Why do you go so far?

43:41.828 --> 43:42.829
What?

43:43.913 --> 43:45.623
You work too hard.

43:49.294 --> 43:52.463
You can give up halfway
, but I can't.

43:52.797 --> 43:55.592
I want to do well and be accepted.

43:55.925 --> 43:58.261
This makes me happy and excited.

44:26.873 --> 44:29.500
Stop talking about me.
Are you OK?

Very bad

Despite this, the cervix is ​​still only two centimeters wide.
You have to wait until you reach ten centimeters.

OMG.

44:43.556 --> 44:44.682
Looking for Ten Centimeters?

44:45.058 --> 44:47.560
Just listening to it makes you think
the body has been torn into pieces.

44:50.313 --> 44:53.274
I want to give my body sugar.
Then let’s go in first.

44:53.358 --> 44:55.485

I'm very anxious now.

45:53.543 --> 45:54.377
a while.

45:57.422 --> 45:58.423
here.

Why did the marketing department come to take a look?
Bid presentations are also available here.

49:26.297 --> 49:30.426
No, not when you have to show your work.
I didn't see you calling us.

49:30.509 --> 49:32.428
They clearly despise each other.

49:32.511 --> 49:34.722
- The sales department invited them to come
- why?

49:34.805 --> 49:37.266
This works for both ads.
and public relations work

49:37.350 --> 49:38.434
So I wanted to come back and have a look.

49:39.727 --> 49:41.062
I don't want answers.

49:42.521 --> 49:45.274
I hate arrogant attitudes.
Are marketers alone?

49:45.358 --> 49:46.359
is that so?

49:46.734 --> 49:48.653
I hate it too.

As for them, they are doing business.

49:54.283 --> 49:56.327
There may be more such people.

49:56.410 --> 49:58.537
But we are the heart of this company.

Do you really need help?
People are busy.

50:05.336 --> 50:07.964

What would we do without you?

50:10.216 --> 50:12.093

okay?

to prevent wrinkles and increase moisture.

51:57.114 --> 52:01.118
Lactobacillus plantarum
is one of the most common foods around us.

52:01.202 --> 52:03.454
That's kimchi.

52:03.537 --> 52:06.040
We expect people in their 30s

52:06.123 --> 52:07.583
This is our target customer group

52:54.421 --> 52:55.923
So what should we do?

52:56.507 --> 52:59.009
What else can I do? We have to get it right.

53:00.094 --> 53:01.887

Let's give it a try, shall we?

53:24.743 --> 53:26.203
I have to go.
