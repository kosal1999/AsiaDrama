You have to find out who the second victim is.

He is dead, Mr. Yin.

01:34.769 --> 01:36.840
I know it doesn't make sense.

01:38.739 --> 01:41.209
Like you came here specifically just to save me.

Did you kill him?

06:32.459 --> 06:33.529
No.

06:35.129 --> 06:36.230
No, Mr. Yin.

06:37.500 --> 06:38.939
Why did you kill him?

06:39.139 --> 06:40.399
Why?

06:40.399 --> 06:43.009
sorry. Please help me.

Why isn't he wearing a ring?

07:33.790 --> 07:34.790
Mr. Yin.

07:35.529 --> 07:38.529
It really doesn't make any sense.

07:39.129 --> 07:40.730
I got it from him

07:40.730 --> 07:42.370
When I met him in the city center yesterday afternoon.

07:43.269 --> 07:46.639
Mr. Yin, this ring has nothing to do with his death.

07:48.009 --> 07:51.209
I met him again, so, we chatted for a while.

07:51.410 --> 07:53.040
Then I went first.

Mr. Yin, this is a fact.

when?

08:04.490 --> 08:05.560
What?

08:06.060 --> 08:07.089
When did you see it?

08:07.959 --> 08:09.029
yesterday afternoon.

08:10.259 --> 08:11.430
if you tell anyone,

08:11.430 --> 08:14.600
The police might know I saw him.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.670
I heard he was a member of the Communist Party.

08:19.399 --> 08:20.569
they might catch me

08:20.569 --> 08:22.939
Because I didn’t report him after seeing him twice.

08:39.320 --> 08:40.789
Is this what you're afraid of?

08:41.159 --> 08:42.460
of.

08:48.730 --> 08:50.129
He never left?

Is Qingai still sleeping?

14:16.830 --> 14:18.830
question...

14:22.200 --> 14:24.570
Man, he must have been sneaking out at night again.

14:25.340 --> 14:26.799
What? Very?

14:27.100 --> 14:30.039
He promised to go home early.

14:30.039 --> 14:32.210
Don’t you know your brother yet?

14:32.279 --> 14:34.409
Do you believe what he says and let him go?

14:39.320 --> 14:40.419
So sad.

14:40.419 --> 14:43.389

14:43.889 --> 14:44.919
- So sad. - Let's finish.

14:44.919 --> 14:45.919

if this does happen

17:41.059 --> 17:42.869
It happens no matter what we do.

17:44.369 --> 17:45.839
You saw it yourself.

17:47.269 --> 17:49.940

not only.

17:55.750 --> 17:56.809
I've never seen it.

17:58.279 --> 17:59.980
He had never died in a place like this.

18:00.950 --> 18:03.650
There is no future that I can change

18:06.089 --> 18:07.190

18:15.000 --> 18:16.369
So, wait until then.

I find it hard to believe. Let's get there quickly.

19:09.720 --> 19:11.019
- where is that? - I can't believe this is happening.

19:11.019 --> 19:12.819
It happened again.

19:14.829 --> 19:17.089
Mi Shu.

19:17.089 --> 19:18.200
Su me!

19:18.299 --> 19:19.460
Did you hear that too?

19:19.900 --> 19:21.230
Isn't this terrible?

19:21.400 --> 19:23.799
I know. How could this happen?

19:24.900 --> 19:26.640
What kind of madman would do such a thing?

19:27.869 --> 19:28.970
How terrible.

19:29.509 --> 19:31.039
How could this happen in our environment?

19:31.039 --> 19:32.039
Yes, right?

19:32.109 --> 19:35.180
We cannot walk freely now. terrible.

19:36.250 --> 19:37.480
Let's get there quickly.

19:43.490 --> 19:44.990
Why do you look so serious?

19:50.789 --> 19:51.799
What?

19:51.900 --> 19:53.930
People may think you killed him.

19:55.869 --> 19:57.200
calm.

19:58.339 --> 19:59.440
You made it very obvious.

20:06.740 --> 20:08.779
hurry up. This will be fun.

20:12.750 --> 20:13.750
Ayo.

20:17.190 --> 20:18.359
Isn't she that girl?

20:18.819 --> 20:20.420
The girl who fled Seoul after participating in a demonstration?

20:22.660 --> 20:25.700
He's not even from this village. Why did he die here?

20:26.259 --> 20:27.799
This will give me more headaches.

20:29.069 --> 20:30.529
Things suddenly got crazy.

20:30.930 --> 20:33.769
- Yes Yes? - Saw his hands tied,

20:34.240 --> 20:36.140
This must be the work of the same person. Where did it go?

20:36.809 --> 20:38.680
No matter who is a fool,

20:38.809 --> 20:40.309
He killed two people in one night.

20:40.380 --> 20:41.980
By the way, Chief.

20:42.150 --> 20:44.980
You are appointed as Commissioner. This won't have any impact, right?

20:44.980 --> 20:46.079
certainly.

20:46.450 --> 20:48.289
Why didn't anyone bring matches?

20:48.519 --> 20:49.589
I told you to get one.

20:50.450 --> 20:51.519
wait.

20:52.990 --> 20:54.730
This guy still smokes?

20:54.789 --> 20:55.859

As long as you hold it,

21:20.680 --> 21:21.920

21:48.450 --> 21:49.509
up to you.

21:49.680 --> 21:51.920
We must find this madman immediately and close the case.

Anyone who has met Lee Joo Young and Lee Kyung Ae.

21:54.789 --> 21:56.750

21:59.059 --> 22:00.259
bring them to me

Now for the prank! Go away.

22:03.390 --> 22:05.029
- OK. - quickly!

22:05.029 --> 22:06.630
- We'll go find them. - I'll come here.

22:06.799 --> 22:08.000
Man, those idiots.

22:09.930 --> 22:11.569
Man, that fool.

22:12.140 --> 22:13.200
So sad.

22:14.640 --> 22:16.640
- Didn't you hear me? - Yes?

22:16.640 --> 22:17.839
Don't plan on missing work again.

22:17.839 --> 22:19.640
Baek Dong-sik, get out of the way.

22:19.740 --> 22:20.740
oops!

22:25.220 --> 22:27.920
So sad. What's so fun about this?

22:28.690 --> 22:31.289
- How could this happen? - I feel pity.

22:31.289 --> 22:33.619
- he died. - How could this happen?

22:33.619 --> 22:36.730
- They said he was dead. - I do not believe.

22:36.730 --> 22:39.000
- He is still very young. - So sad.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.059
- This is tragic. - So sad.

23:58.410 --> 23:59.609
Yin Yong.

24:00.609 --> 24:01.710
Yun Ying!

24:03.079 --> 24:04.279
Mr. Yin!

24:06.049 --> 24:07.420
Is there no one at home?

24:07.920 --> 24:09.619
who can help me?

24:10.990 --> 24:12.160
Anyone please...

24:13.259 --> 24:15.759
help me.

24:20.799 --> 24:21.799
Yin Yong.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.299
my brother...

24:28.710 --> 24:29.940
so...

24:33.910 --> 24:35.079
my brother...

24:41.690 --> 24:43.289
I know.

24:47.519 --> 24:48.589
I know.

24:49.630 --> 24:50.660
sorry.

24:53.730 --> 24:55.569
My mother is acting strange, Yoon-young.

25:10.150 --> 25:11.349
I said this is dangerous.

25:13.680 --> 25:17.150
I say the world is a scary place.

25:18.920 --> 25:21.319
He never listens to me.

25:22.730 --> 25:23.829
Mother

25:23.960 --> 25:26.029
Why did he arrive so late?

25:29.869 --> 25:32.069
What was he doing there so late?

25:33.569 --> 25:34.599
He is great.

25:35.869 --> 25:38.279
That silly kid.

25:40.079 --> 25:43.279
It's clear what people will say.

25:45.650 --> 25:47.980
I told you not to let the phone ring.

25:59.130 --> 26:00.359
Those idiots.

26:01.670 --> 26:03.930
They keep harping on it because it's not their problem.

26:04.700 --> 26:07.869
Is this just fun gossip to them?

26:08.440 --> 26:10.970
Why do they keep calling?

26:13.380 --> 26:14.440
Mother

26:18.920 --> 26:19.980

26:44.240 --> 26:45.309
Hey.

26:46.740 --> 26:47.740
Can I...

26:48.650 --> 26:50.549
Excuse me

26:57.119 --> 26:58.150
Hey.

26:59.059 --> 27:01.019
Will you open the door and come see me?

27:08.029 --> 27:09.500
About my grandmother...

27:12.240 --> 27:14.740
Do you know when and how he died?

27:16.140 --> 27:18.109
All I know is that he died long before I was born.

27:18.109 --> 27:21.039
I never heard how or why he died.

27:24.549 --> 27:25.619
Is it available?

27:27.150 --> 27:30.589
Does it have anything to do with today's incident?

27:35.690 --> 27:37.430
If true,

27:38.799 --> 27:40.759
At least I wanted to save him.

27:42.099 --> 27:45.200
Can you tell me how to save him?

27:49.509 --> 27:52.140
I'm afraid everything will go bad because of me

27:53.640 --> 27:56.950
This is how it all ends.

28:17.869 --> 28:19.539
However, I saw it all.

28:22.609 --> 28:25.240
I've been running around trying to save them.

28:27.480 --> 28:28.710
Their feelings for each other.

28:31.079 --> 28:32.450
I saw it all.

28:34.519 --> 28:36.319
Isn't it important at all?

28:38.990 --> 28:40.420
And just got here?

28:41.829 --> 28:42.859
how can that be possible?

28:45.599 --> 28:46.730
I do not believe.

28:53.299 --> 28:56.009
Unless we can go back to a time we never met

28:58.369 --> 29:00.339
No matter where we are, things will never go back to the way they were.

29:15.690 --> 29:17.960

29:17.990 --> 29:20.630

Or step back.

29:42.589 --> 29:43.690
That!

29:46.289 --> 29:47.460
A bet is a bet.

29:51.329 --> 29:52.400
You know how it works.

29:53.859 --> 29:54.930
this.

30:06.640 --> 30:08.140
Oh my god, daddy's boy.

30:08.210 --> 30:09.750
So sad. Father's son!

30:09.750 --> 30:11.250
I miss dad.

30:12.450 --> 30:14.049
Let me see, Dad. This is good.

30:14.920 --> 30:16.220
- Is this your bag? - Yes.

30:16.220 --> 30:17.549
Ayo.

30:17.549 --> 30:19.519
- Are you OK? - I am fine.

30:27.559 --> 30:29.799
- Stop looking at me, Dad. - Come on, kid.

30:31.329 --> 30:34.140
Dad waited three years to see your face again.

30:34.339 --> 30:36.609
Dad just stared at you for 30 minutes.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.079
I'm very busy on campus. sorry.

30:40.809 --> 30:44.279
So sad. However, your grades are outstanding.

30:46.150 --> 30:49.150
I think the Yin family is really smart.

30:49.250 --> 30:50.390
you, father,

30:50.789 --> 30:53.390
There is also a teacher that my father likes very much recently.

30:53.660 --> 30:56.130
His name is Yoon Haejun. He is also Yin.

30:58.960 --> 31:00.900
- Haejun? - Yes. Why?

31:01.970 --> 31:03.569
I like this name.

31:04.230 --> 31:05.240
is that so?

31:06.140 --> 31:08.539
Dad said he would introduce you to him when you come back.

31:09.170 --> 31:11.470
He said there were some things that needed to be sorted out.

31:11.839 --> 31:14.109
You are very good at it.

31:14.109 --> 31:16.250
You are the best in Korea, right?

31:20.750 --> 31:21.920
Dad is very happy.

31:31.789 --> 31:34.230
- damn it. Hey, catch him. - Unfortunately.

31:39.339 --> 31:40.599
What happened?

31:40.940 --> 31:41.940
who knows.

31:42.309 --> 31:43.339
Stay in the car.

31:48.039 --> 31:49.079
Come in.

31:49.980 --> 31:52.220

Welcome to Korea.

32:26.720 --> 32:27.980
Is this Haejun’s home?

32:47.099 --> 32:48.140
Who are you?

32:50.940 --> 32:53.309
I came because I heard he needed my help to solve some problems.

32:58.849 --> 33:00.519
Did I come at the wrong time?

33:01.779 --> 33:02.849
in this case,

33:04.250 --> 33:05.289
Can you give this to him?

33:06.619 --> 33:09.660
If he can solve this problem in five seconds, I will solve the problem he wants.

33:10.759 --> 33:14.700
If he can't solve the Rubik's Cube, I'll have to think about it.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.569
I like smart people.

33:20.769 --> 33:21.799
If so, see you soon.

33:40.759 --> 33:42.490
Local residents were trembling with fear.

33:42.690 --> 33:44.329
This is a report by reporter Wu Rencheng.

33:44.859 --> 33:46.230
Around 06 o'clock today,

33:46.230 --> 33:50.000
Li, a 22-year-old local resident, was found dead covered in blood.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.730
in an empty house

33:51.730 --> 33:53.640
It is located on a hill in Houzhongli, Houzhong Town, Houzhong County.

Wuzhongli has been a crime-free village for five consecutive years.

34:36.210 --> 34:37.349
I was serious.

34:37.610 --> 34:41.150
After becoming Miss Korea, I will buy my mother a fur coat.

34:41.679 --> 34:44.250
I don't believe you are my daughter.

34:44.789 --> 34:45.860
So sad.

34:46.260 --> 34:48.389
Do you think everyone can afford a fur coat?

34:48.719 --> 34:52.559
I didn't ask my mother to buy it for me. I said I would buy it.

34:52.800 --> 34:55.769
Stop pushing and stop drinking.

34:56.530 --> 34:59.570
Miss Korea? Just the truth. Respect your elders.

34:59.570 --> 35:00.699
enough.

35:00.900 --> 35:03.070
Why doesn't anyone believe me?

35:03.070 --> 35:05.440
They said I had potential.

35:05.679 --> 35:06.679
you

35:07.039 --> 35:10.150
Don't get involved with bad people, right?

35:10.349 --> 35:12.780
Mom doesn't understand such things.

35:16.750 --> 35:19.860
But can you help me a little?

35:20.389 --> 35:21.590
Are you crazy?

35:22.489 --> 35:24.860
We have no money. We're broke.

35:39.610 --> 35:41.340
- I'm going to school. - OK.

35:41.340 --> 35:42.550
I go to work.

- Mother. - Have a great day.

35:44.079 --> 35:46.849
- Mother. -damn you...

35:46.849 --> 35:49.389
- Mother. - What happened this time?

35:50.150 --> 35:53.320
Come on, Mom. I was serious.

35:54.159 --> 35:56.860
- After becoming Miss Korea... - Miss Korea? No.

35:57.130 --> 35:59.460
Even if you don’t become Miss Korea

35:59.900 --> 36:03.199
I will make a lot of money to buy my mother a fur coat, okay?

36:03.800 --> 36:05.369
what's wrong with you?

36:05.369 --> 36:08.139
Why do you always talk about fur coats?

36:08.440 --> 36:11.409
do you remember? Long time no see... What's his name?

36:11.409 --> 36:14.380
Yes. Our neighbor, Shengzhen’s mother. Mom is jealous

36:14.380 --> 36:16.349
and his mink coat.

36:16.449 --> 36:18.050
- Chengzhen’s mother? - Yes.

36:19.150 --> 36:21.250
Do you mean the family that moved in when you were nine?

36:21.280 --> 36:22.349
of.

36:23.449 --> 36:25.789
From then on, my dream was to buy

36:25.789 --> 36:28.789
Wear the same fur coat for mom. wait. No.

36:28.929 --> 36:31.530
buy you a nicer coat

36:31.530 --> 36:32.929
is my dream.

36:33.659 --> 36:36.329
I think I'm very close to realizing my dream now.

36:36.570 --> 36:39.170
So, wait,

How about a kiss? It has been a long time.

36:43.570 --> 36:45.269
- Mom, I'm going to school. - So sad.

36:45.440 --> 36:46.510
do not disturb. Let mom go.

36:47.010 --> 36:48.980
- Have you brought what you need? - Yes.

36:49.679 --> 36:50.710
Ayo.

36:59.360 --> 37:00.519
A heartless mother.

37:04.130 --> 37:05.130

37:06.800 --> 37:07.960
He should be hugged.

37:10.699 --> 37:13.340
You should hug him.

37:17.309 --> 37:19.539
When the opportunity arises,

37:22.610 --> 37:24.579
You should hug him as much as possible.

37:37.059 --> 37:38.460

At least 40 years.

40:27.030 --> 40:28.829
No, there will be more!

40:37.010 --> 40:38.739
You thought you could rest in peace

40:39.340 --> 40:40.980
What would you do to them if you knew?

40:48.579 --> 40:50.650
Your decision will affect many people.

40:51.849 --> 40:53.760
so tell me

40:54.860 --> 40:56.960
You can overcome this and get through it.

40:57.929 --> 40:58.989

41:36.599 --> 41:37.670
Be careful.

41:39.900 --> 41:40.969

- OK! - Mother.

41:51.780 --> 41:53.079
You stupid!

42:04.230 --> 42:07.300
- seriously! I'm scared. - Mother...

42:10.900 --> 42:11.929
Mother...

42:40.260 --> 42:42.530
Should we hug?

42:48.800 --> 42:50.940
A lot happened today.

42:53.079 --> 42:55.610
let us...

43:40.559 --> 43:41.889
You'd try again, wouldn't you?

43:44.289 --> 43:45.360
catch the culprit

43:46.400 --> 43:47.800
and rescued a third victim.

43:49.500 --> 43:50.969
This can't be the end.

43:52.469 --> 43:54.639
I don't want us to be strangers.

44:03.909 --> 44:05.449
Someone is coming for you.

44:08.550 --> 44:10.219
He's a little weird.

44:14.690 --> 44:15.989
what did he say?

44:17.190 --> 44:19.289
He said if you did it in five seconds, he would fix it.

44:23.800 --> 44:24.900
what is that?

44:29.199 --> 44:30.909
Do you really want to ask him to solve it?

44:31.940 --> 44:33.280
I can ask him this.

44:34.179 --> 44:37.050
Eventually, we have to come back, even if it's not now.

44:37.909 --> 44:39.349
who is he?

44:42.179 --> 44:44.719
Can you show me the car?

44:45.920 --> 44:47.760
I know how to handle it.

44:49.690 --> 44:50.960
He is my father.

44:52.460 --> 44:53.500
Oh, that's right.

44:54.360 --> 44:55.400
What?

45:11.150 --> 45:12.750
I guess you're not hiding anything anymore

45:12.750 --> 45:14.949
But you kept the greatest secret.

45:16.949 --> 45:18.449
I mean, your family is here.

45:18.449 --> 45:20.559
How could you keep it a secret until now?

45:21.219 --> 45:23.659
I'm waiting for the right time, which is now.

45:26.099 --> 45:28.800
So, Principal Yin, whom we meet every day...

45:30.599 --> 45:32.630
No wonder you have the same last name.

45:36.710 --> 45:38.570
We have to exclude some people.

45:39.809 --> 45:40.840
Both.

45:41.539 --> 45:43.150
From what I've seen,

45:43.750 --> 45:45.909
He couldn't tie anyone with these fingers.

45:48.949 --> 45:50.289
My bones are broken. sick!

45:50.889 --> 45:53.159
You may not be able to tie any rope right now.

45:53.860 --> 45:54.960
victim.

45:55.619 --> 45:57.690
Two victims were tied up with red ropes

45:57.690 --> 45:58.789
when they were discovered.

46:05.269 --> 46:06.739
Except for his fingers,

46:07.639 --> 46:09.570
It looked like he was hurt everywhere.

46:10.239 --> 46:11.269
I mean, Gao Minxiu.

46:13.909 --> 46:16.480
Liu Beomyong is not afraid of being accused of murder.

46:16.710 --> 46:18.150
I heard he was a member of the Communist Party.

46:19.849 --> 46:21.019
they might arrest me

46:21.019 --> 46:23.420
Because I didn’t report him after seeing him twice.

46:25.250 --> 46:26.619
Is this what you're afraid of?

46:26.860 --> 46:28.159
of.

46:28.289 --> 46:30.360
Unless he's really good at acting.

46:31.260 --> 46:33.230
It seems he doesn't know either

46:33.230 --> 46:34.929
There was another murder.

46:43.110 --> 46:45.170
"Suspect in Yu Zhongli Serial Murder Case"

46:48.280 --> 46:49.909
I have no reason.

46:52.780 --> 46:55.019
And the original owner of Blue Hat, Baek You-seop.

46:56.619 --> 46:58.489
Now there is one more person.

47:01.889 --> 47:03.429
The person who tells the biggest lie.

47:06.659 --> 47:07.800
don't miss me

47:10.500 --> 47:11.530
Mi Shu.

47:11.699 --> 47:13.570
now I understand

47:14.039 --> 47:15.500
Why would he lie like that.

47:16.139 --> 47:17.409
About my brother...

47:19.139 --> 47:20.510
you think i am happy

47:21.010 --> 47:22.809
About his ending,

47:23.849 --> 47:25.409
Or something else?

47:25.849 --> 47:27.219
If you need help please let me know.

47:27.480 --> 47:30.590
Because I still appreciate everything you do.

47:31.150 --> 47:33.619
He was happy with what happened to Gao Minxiu.

47:35.389 --> 47:37.159
Remember what he did to me

47:38.289 --> 47:40.929
I'm sure he wasn't a good brother to his younger siblings either.

47:43.329 --> 47:45.300
What matters here is how much he knows.

47:47.699 --> 47:50.110
How much does Gao Meishu know?

47:50.639 --> 47:52.670
Blame Go Min-soo?

47:53.139 --> 47:54.639
And how he knew it.

47:55.710 --> 47:57.250
The circumstances surrounding the incident are important.

47:58.650 --> 48:00.449
This means he knows quite a lot of details

48:00.449 --> 48:01.949
Put it in his novel.

48:03.349 --> 48:04.420
you're right.

48:07.719 --> 48:09.420
We have to deal with Baek Hee-seop first.

48:12.130 --> 48:15.030
He will be selected as the first suspect in about 30 minutes

48:15.400 --> 48:16.469
by the police.

48:38.519 --> 48:41.559
"Baek Dong-sik"

48:45.659 --> 48:47.730
Who would go to a student’s home like this?

48:52.130 --> 48:53.340
Where is your sister?

48:54.400 --> 48:55.599
When was the last time you saw him?

48:56.440 --> 48:58.469
I guess you don't know yet

48:59.239 --> 49:01.110
But my uncle is a policeman.

49:03.409 --> 49:06.480
I know you're a teacher, but if you do this...

49:08.420 --> 49:10.650
Your uncle will come soon to arrest you.

49:10.820 --> 49:11.920
About five minutes to go.

49:27.800 --> 49:28.869
What's this?

49:30.340 --> 49:31.969
Why did you hide it there?

49:40.519 --> 49:41.579
when

49:42.719 --> 49:45.619
Do you think people are in the greatest danger?

49:47.019 --> 49:48.920
“Bong Bong Tea Shop”

49:49.889 --> 49:52.559
"Two hours ago"

49:59.429 --> 50:01.940
Hope you can correct all your mistakes.

50:03.869 --> 50:05.639
The illusion that you can make all your mistakes go away

50:05.639 --> 50:07.210
It's like it never happened.

50:09.340 --> 50:12.349
When you are immersed in this sweet and sad pseudo-dream,

50:13.849 --> 50:15.480
You realize at some point...

50:18.250 --> 50:19.289
"Bernar."

50:20.889 --> 50:23.429
“There are no wrongs in the world that can be righted.”

50:25.730 --> 50:28.260
However, when you realize this,

50:29.130 --> 50:32.469
You have been destroyed by the wheel of fortune.

50:38.570 --> 50:39.780
What's important

direction.

50:44.050 --> 50:46.010
what are you saying?

50:47.150 --> 50:49.849
Without further ado, let’s get to the point.

50:51.820 --> 50:53.219
Why do you want to see me?

50:54.989 --> 50:56.289
Your weakness.

50:58.489 --> 51:00.429
I think I can answer that for you.

51:01.630 --> 51:02.699
What are the weaknesses?

51:11.710 --> 51:13.579
If you want to throw it away, you should throw it away quietly.

51:14.940 --> 51:16.480
What's this? So stupid.

51:31.929 --> 51:33.960
You want to protect someone,

51:37.130 --> 51:38.699
I want to get rid of someone.

51:41.670 --> 51:43.869
I think we can help each other.

51:45.139 --> 51:46.510
What are you going to do to me?

51:58.150 --> 51:59.590
Your sister's actions.

52:29.619 --> 52:30.789
You fool.

52:32.050 --> 52:33.519
He doesn't even know anything.

52:39.190 --> 52:40.960
I don't know why you are here.

52:44.829 --> 52:45.900
However, this is mine.

52:49.599 --> 52:50.940
I did them all.

53:07.119 --> 53:08.619
- I did nothing. - enough.

53:10.130 --> 53:11.829
It's really not me.

53:12.230 --> 53:13.230
Then why are you running away?

53:13.429 --> 53:15.900
Why can't you trust me?

53:17.070 --> 53:19.130
- I did nothing. -damn you...

53:19.630 --> 53:21.269
You'd better be honest with me.

53:21.269 --> 53:22.500
So sad.

53:27.610 --> 53:29.039
It's really not me.

53:29.039 --> 53:30.610
What do you mean this is not you?

this is mine.

54:25.170 --> 54:27.239
I did them all.

54:29.699 --> 54:30.869
who I am?

54:33.139 --> 54:34.579
Where am I?

54:38.050 --> 54:39.849
Do I really want to leave?

54:39.849 --> 54:41.019
so far

54:43.280 --> 54:45.320
Just to hear my dad say that to me?

54:50.860 --> 54:53.090
Everything becomes clearer.

54:54.500 --> 54:55.800
for me,

54:57.599 --> 54:59.800
from start to finish,

55:01.239 --> 55:03.000
Dad is just a sad man

55:05.510 --> 55:07.980
I don’t understand or don’t want to understand.

So sad. My poor child.

what should I do?

55:28.559 --> 55:29.730
make sure

55:30.400 --> 55:32.369
You're back.

55:33.000 --> 55:34.940
You have to survive.

55:35.900 --> 55:39.070
You have to survive no matter what. you understand?

55:43.039 --> 55:45.309
Wake up, Baek Hee-seop. Get a grip on yourself.

55:47.150 --> 55:48.449
This is driving me crazy.

55:51.920 --> 55:53.690
Wake up and look into your eyes!

55:57.760 --> 55:58.760
Listen carefully.

56:00.599 --> 56:01.599
this...

56:02.400 --> 56:04.030
your life

56:04.829 --> 56:07.739
Your family's life depends on it.

56:09.369 --> 56:10.940
If you lie...

56:14.380 --> 56:16.510
No one knows what will happen better than me.

56:17.880 --> 56:20.820
This is none of your business, just leave.

56:25.250 --> 56:26.920
If you stay here, someone's going to get hurt.

56:29.590 --> 56:30.590
let's go.

56:32.059 --> 56:34.000
What else is there to listen to? He has admitted it.

56:35.329 --> 56:37.030
Make him pay for his crimes.

56:38.670 --> 56:40.369
Although I don't know if this is possible.

56:42.440 --> 56:43.869
wait. you...

57:08.199 --> 57:09.199
Uncle Dong-sik.

57:14.539 --> 57:15.570
What did uncle just hear...

57:17.010 --> 57:18.269
Is all this true?

57:22.010 --> 57:23.010
sorry.

57:24.809 --> 57:26.510
Sorry, Uncle Dong-sik.

57:39.889 --> 57:40.900
you...

57:46.730 --> 57:47.969
Come with uncle, asshole.

57:48.769 --> 57:49.840
Stand up, damn!

57:59.550 --> 58:01.579
You keep meeting me.

58:02.920 --> 58:05.219
This can't be a good thing.

58:08.059 --> 58:09.659
You'd better remember this. understand?

58:15.599 --> 58:16.630
Ayo.

58:17.630 --> 58:18.699
Come on, fuck it!

58:58.739 --> 58:59.769
sorry.

59:04.110 --> 59:05.110
sorry.

59:06.849 --> 59:07.849
sorry.

59:09.019 --> 59:10.079
sorry.

59:27.440 --> 59:28.969
You are putting others first again.

59:32.670 --> 59:35.380
Everything happened because of my father.

59:37.409 --> 59:39.449
Your reasoning ends here.

59:41.849 --> 59:44.389
And why I happened to follow you here.

59:46.090 --> 59:48.159
Maybe that's why.

59:53.230 --> 59:56.530
I don't even know where to apologize.

01:00:14.079 --> 01:00:16.079
I don't know if this will make you feel better.

01:00:18.050 --> 01:00:19.090
but

01:00:21.059 --> 01:00:22.989
I won’t live a good life.

01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:26.130
No.

01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:29.500
I won't be able to do it.

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:37.840
This time the police heard my father's confession,

01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:40.679
So, he will be punished soon.

01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:44.579
My mother would soon find out.

01:00:47.579 --> 01:00:50.420
So that means he won't marry her.

01:00:53.989 --> 01:00:55.760
- Then I'll... - Disappear.

01:00:57.789 --> 01:00:59.829
Will this make me feel better?

01:01:09.099 --> 01:01:10.099
sorry,

01:01:11.139 --> 01:01:13.039
But that won't happen. I'll make sure.

01:01:14.309 --> 01:01:15.710
Because I can't feel it

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.949
Your father Baek Hee-seop is the culprit.

How can you kill someone, little bastard?

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:11.400
The question I asked before...

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:12.429
What's this?

01:02:12.599 --> 01:02:13.900
Why did you hide it here?

01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:15.170
When I asked him, "Why?"

01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:17.239
He suddenly replied: "It's mine."

01:02:17.239 --> 01:02:18.969
There was no need, since it was something in his own room.

01:02:18.969 --> 01:02:20.710
I am sure. My uncle won't let me touch him

01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:23.010

01:02:25.679 --> 01:02:26.710
Is this from Yu Sub?

this is mine.
