"The Stranger I Met"
Episode 15

00:16.519 --> 00:19.090
(Wu Jindong)

00:28.799 --> 00:31.499
(Kyung Gi Joo)

00:40.840 --> 00:43.980
(a stranger I met)

00:59.429 --> 01:01.759
(Bangbang Teahouse)

01:50.809 --> 01:54.550
(Episode 15, the reason why I can’t leave)

02:51.310 --> 02:52.410
Haijun

02:53.009 --> 02:54.039
Father

03:01.949 --> 03:02.979
Father

03:03.620 --> 03:05.620
Is this because Hae Joon will come back anyway?

03:10.019 --> 03:11.729
He was very good to me when he was here

03:12.590 --> 03:16.000
Just wait like crazy

03:17.060 --> 03:18.699
The son asked him if he would come back

03:20.169 --> 03:22.269
really annoying

03:28.509 --> 03:29.840
what exactly is it?

03:31.049 --> 03:32.410
what is it?

03:34.750 --> 03:37.579
Why did you come to me?

03:37.819 --> 03:39.819
they are talking about looking for me

03:41.690 --> 03:43.220
(Part 15)

03:54.699 --> 03:58.539
(Congratulations to the 1988 Seoul Olympics
)

04:16.319 --> 04:18.130
This news is about teachers

04:28.470 --> 04:29.900
I saw the defendant's face

04:32.410 --> 04:33.439
you do not say

04:38.979 --> 04:40.780
I'll come to your house at noon

04:41.879 --> 04:43.720
Anyway, my plan was
ruined.

04:44.150 --> 04:45.820
I really want to hear

04:48.260 --> 04:50.390
I'm here to tell you this

04:51.929 --> 04:53.760
But
there is still one person without you

04:55.460 --> 04:56.700
And the defendant

04:58.729 --> 04:59.770
What

04:59.900 --> 05:02.600
Although I often miss the things nearby

05:06.410 --> 05:09.309
I was told to stay in my house
and come to me to inquire.

05:10.210 --> 05:12.080
What do you want me to do?

05:13.179 --> 05:14.919
What are you talking about now?

05:16.220 --> 05:17.650
you really don't know

05:20.150 --> 05:21.260
Brother Yun Wule

05:23.359 --> 05:24.989
The principal's son said

05:30.260 --> 05:31.770
He is the culprit

05:50.350 --> 05:51.419
Why did you come?

05:59.330 --> 06:00.359
far away

06:29.760 --> 06:30.760
Lacquer water

06:32.160 --> 06:34.359
i know where to go

08:16.960 --> 08:18.499
Lee Joo Young Lee Kyun Il

08:19.030 --> 08:20.499
The murder of the Youbum brothers

08:20.999 --> 08:23.900
Conspiracy to murder Lee Sun-il and Yoon Hye-joon

08:26.910 --> 08:28.410
Yun Yunwu was arrested

08:29.609 --> 08:32.950
From now on I'm going to search the house for evidence.

08:37.320 --> 08:38.320
Come

08:43.290 --> 08:45.229
Is the director okay?

08:47.960 --> 08:52.229
No. How did this happen?

08:53.629 --> 08:56.600
Dong-seok asks what’s going on

08:58.869 --> 09:02.080
Although teacher Yin Hyejun was sent to the hospital

09:03.879 --> 09:05.210
I haven't regained consciousness yet

09:29.170 --> 09:30.239
Haijun

09:33.470 --> 09:34.570
Haijun

09:40.580 --> 09:43.350
Wait, how did this happen?

09:44.450 --> 09:45.489
Miss

09:55.100 --> 09:56.129
Haijun

09:58.070 --> 09:59.100
Haijun

10:12.080 --> 10:13.149
Haijun

10:32.570 --> 10:36.440
What happens to the defendant now?

10:37.170 --> 10:38.840
check carefully

10:40.210 --> 10:41.909
I have to make sure I pay off my debt

10:42.779 --> 10:43.879
That is..

10:45.210 --> 10:47.379
I hope I can be Mr. Yoon Hye Jun

10:54.420 --> 10:57.159
If I get caught, I guess it's all over

11:00.529 --> 11:02.159
without any sin

11:03.460 --> 11:05.330
Those who died miserably

11:09.570 --> 11:13.440
I don't know if I can pay for all these sins..but
still

11:23.720 --> 11:26.149
for him now

11:30.790 --> 11:33.589
I have to say it because
I feel like this is something that will never end with me for the rest of my life

11:33.590 --> 11:35.029
I'm afraid of that

11:39.029 --> 11:41.539
How could I give him
such an answer?

11:41.540 --> 11:44.040
I'm very sorry about this

12:01.019 --> 12:02.119
so

12:03.560 --> 12:07.029
Did he really
mean that Hye-jun was caused by him?

12:23.180 --> 12:24.339
When Yunwu comes back

12:24.340 --> 12:26.450
I went to the airport by myself

12:26.749 --> 12:29.320
After four hours of driving
, I...

12:29.420 --> 12:31.450
He drove next to him

12:31.550 --> 12:33.950
Everyone in the village was dead by then

12:34.249 --> 12:36.359
when we return to the bubbling place

12:36.519 --> 12:38.529
I met him,
but how?

12:39.659 --> 12:43.129
Didn't the director check the passport?

12:43.759 --> 12:44.830
A passport?

13:00.479 --> 13:02.279
Yunwu
returns to this village for the first time

13:02.979 --> 13:06.220
Earlier than the director knew

13:07.920 --> 13:09.790
He was never suspected from the beginning

13:09.960 --> 13:11.190
that's why

13:12.830 --> 13:16.300
Yunwu deceived everyone from the beginning

13:17.060 --> 13:18.769
Until the day I return to this village

13:32.350 --> 13:35.249
When, where and what kind
of crime was committed?

13:35.779 --> 13:37.580
You must say it now with your mouth

13:38.920 --> 13:40.050
sick

13:41.119 --> 13:43.159
not getting smarter

13:43.859 --> 13:45.830
Must say it

13:46.060 --> 13:47.330
He said he was sick

13:48.899 --> 13:51.159
The hand that uncle threw

13:52.129 --> 13:53.430
sorry

13:55.269 --> 13:57.639
I think I need therapy

13:58.670 --> 14:00.769
Can't you call me daddy?

14:03.479 --> 14:05.080
Don't you know where this is now?

14:07.680 --> 14:10.019
Don't you know why you are here?

14:13.420 --> 14:15.090
I am not sure

14:16.460 --> 14:19.060
Uncle, can you explain?

14:20.229 --> 14:22.529
- What
- like a witness.

14:23.560 --> 14:25.369
If you show me something like

14:36.509 --> 14:37.509
Why?

14:40.710 --> 14:42.379
Is there no evidence?

14:48.389 --> 14:50.720
Now, my house
and my room

14:51.889 --> 14:53.859
Search is enough

15:00.930 --> 15:03.369
But don’t you see anything?

15:07.609 --> 15:09.009
of course not

15:10.210 --> 15:11.779
because i didn't do it

15:15.879 --> 15:16.879
correct?

15:53.019 --> 15:54.090
How are you?

15:55.720 --> 15:57.019
do you remember?

16:38.330 --> 16:39.869
What happened to the defendant?

16:41.529 --> 16:43.040
It's all over now

16:44.570 --> 16:47.440
Detective Shi Badong took it and
inspected it

17:06.790 --> 17:08.730
Will you continue to look away from me?

17:20.010 --> 17:21.070
sorry

17:23.179 --> 17:25.909
You hurt your family like this

17:28.310 --> 17:29.719
this is my father

17:31.820 --> 17:34.750
I came from that disgusting one too.

17:36.659 --> 17:39.560
That despicable person
hurt you too

17:41.790 --> 17:43.830
Why are you apologizing for this?

17:46.070 --> 17:47.399
you and me

17:48.669 --> 17:51.240
Everything our family has been through

17:53.169 --> 17:55.310
not a single error

17:58.409 --> 18:00.350
So
don't say such things again

18:02.149 --> 18:03.879
Don't think so

18:08.619 --> 18:10.659
He didn't know where he came from

18:13.929 --> 18:16.159
Nothing has changed for me

18:27.639 --> 18:29.409
Thanks for reminding me

18:58.270 --> 18:59.369
director

19:05.879 --> 19:07.649
The culprit is 100% certain

19:08.010 --> 19:09.719
After entering the trap, we were imprisoned in

19:10.219 --> 19:12.519
As soon as he knew I was there,
he ran away

19:12.520 --> 19:15.889
And you're trying to escape in your car

19:18.560 --> 19:19.889
I'm injured

19:20.659 --> 19:22.659
If the entry date is incorrect

19:23.060 --> 19:25.469
There are a few points worth doubting

19:25.899 --> 19:27.070
but

19:28.469 --> 19:30.040
no concrete evidence

19:31.070 --> 19:33.969
He is light because he knows it

19:34.169 --> 19:37.639
It appears to have been carefully cleaned to prevent the police from discovering it.

19:38.480 --> 19:40.449
I
asked if there was any evidence

19:40.609 --> 19:41.850
How about handwriting?

19:42.419 --> 19:45.020
Have you checked that the handwriting matches the handwriting in the message?

19:54.659 --> 19:55.730
what are these?

19:56.359 --> 19:57.359
at the same time

19:59.469 --> 20:01.330
Wu Yun sent it to me from the United States

20:02.040 --> 20:04.500
weekly letters

20:07.570 --> 20:09.510
this is what i have

20:17.250 --> 20:18.279
(Zhou Airlines)

20:18.280 --> 20:20.889
(Arrived in the U.S. and
made arrangements)

20:21.350 --> 20:22.459
This is it

20:23.919 --> 20:26.189
The handwriting is different from the Yun Wu I know

20:27.159 --> 20:28.830
Because I am the only one who knows this handwriting

20:30.159 --> 20:31.230
in this whole world

20:34.300 --> 20:36.199
I'm the only one who knows

20:37.669 --> 20:39.340
Because of this handwriting

20:41.209 --> 20:42.310
Watch now

20:43.540 --> 20:45.280
others will find out

20:47.879 --> 20:50.050
Message left by the defendant to the victim

20:51.480 --> 20:52.919
The handwriting is there

20:55.250 --> 20:56.389
Because it's the same

21:01.290 --> 21:02.330
handwriting

21:02.730 --> 21:05.000
It's not easy to lie when you want to

21:05.330 --> 21:06.730
That's why I'm confused

21:08.330 --> 21:09.600
Just like when Gomin was fat

21:10.070 --> 21:12.070
Generally speaking, if there is handwritten material

21:12.340 --> 21:13.770
This can be compared with each other

21:15.240 --> 21:17.179
No matter how I search, there is no result

21:19.750 --> 21:22.679
After the news airs,
find your woman

21:23.919 --> 21:25.080
The owner of an ordinary teahouse

21:27.290 --> 21:29.919
Did he tell you that
Yunwu was the culprit?

21:32.159 --> 21:34.329
know something from him

21:34.330 --> 21:35.859
Although I try hard to find

21:36.600 --> 21:38.800
I wonder where they disappeared after the teahouse closed.

21:39.869 --> 21:41.100
Absolutely untraceable

21:41.300 --> 21:43.270
That's it, it's enough to leave the village

21:45.969 --> 21:47.469
Because he wants to leave

21:53.609 --> 21:55.409
What's that word?

21:56.679 --> 21:58.250
want to be different from others

22:00.750 --> 22:02.290
I will write something special

22:05.020 --> 22:06.629
It's time to write me a letter

22:08.730 --> 22:10.600
He said he could write with his other hand

22:11.830 --> 22:13.699
I thought it was just a fantasy

22:14.600 --> 22:16.570
Because he thinks so

22:18.840 --> 22:20.040
i like it better

22:22.709 --> 22:23.909
But one day

22:25.139 --> 22:26.479
Detectives come looking for him

22:26.480 --> 22:28.079
(The clouds dance to Li Chao'a)

22:28.080 --> 22:30.320
A message from Matchbox appears

22:32.550 --> 22:34.149
Because our theater doesn't match

22:34.949 --> 22:36.059
If it's just a customer

22:36.060 --> 22:37.060
I don't know if I still remember

22:38.490 --> 22:40.030
I remembered it immediately

22:40.889 --> 22:42.459
Because I am the only one who knows this handwriting

22:45.730 --> 22:46.830
in this case..

22:48.399 --> 22:51.139
Why didn't you tell me then?

23:04.719 --> 23:06.189
Unless you're not...

23:16.600 --> 23:17.899
I want to escape

23:20.570 --> 23:21.570
this time

23:23.270 --> 23:24.899
I always wanted to escape

23:26.540 --> 23:28.070
Although he did want to escape

23:30.240 --> 23:31.310
Yoon Hye-joon

23:35.750 --> 23:37.550
As soon as I told him

23:41.090 --> 23:42.619
but not enough evidence

23:43.990 --> 23:46.830
Wu Yun is a smart man

23:47.859 --> 23:49.800
Making mistakes is not enough

23:52.570 --> 23:53.929
Besides

23:55.869 --> 23:57.639
(Zhou Airlines)

23:57.800 --> 23:59.740
- That's why..
- You

24:02.169 --> 24:04.310
What's the real reason you came to see me ?

24:14.149 --> 24:15.219
detective

24:20.629 --> 24:21.659
what

24:22.600 --> 24:24.560
Owner of Bom Bom Tea House

24:25.869 --> 24:29.240
Haven't there been enough cases where I helped you find him ?

24:29.570 --> 24:30.570
Well

24:32.770 --> 24:35.609
Because he looks important

24:36.409 --> 24:38.439
Although we are the same now

24:39.379 --> 24:40.810
especially for him

24:46.449 --> 24:47.490
Unless it's not...

24:54.330 --> 24:55.859
if you leave the village

24:56.730 --> 24:58.530
I don't even know if I'm going to the grocery store

24:59.369 --> 25:01.129
by my grandfather

25:01.369 --> 25:04.439
I'll go see if I can investigate.

25:07.740 --> 25:09.139
Thank you Yin Yan

25:13.209 --> 25:15.780
If you are the owner of Bom Bom Teahouse,
you must have seen

25:16.520 --> 25:20.090
Sitting alone in front of the grocery store for a long time

25:21.020 --> 25:23.659
The girl just
sat alone, feeling sad

25:24.490 --> 25:26.090
I sat with you for a while

25:26.959 --> 25:28.358
I didn't see it until I got on the bus

25:28.359 --> 25:31.629
So I look at where I'm going and which bus I'm going to take

25:32.899 --> 25:34.530
I have no idea

25:35.500 --> 25:37.399
I can't remember clearly

25:40.969 --> 25:42.040
Thanks

25:48.010 --> 25:49.080
How are you?

25:50.780 --> 25:51.780
What

25:53.719 --> 25:55.250
Because of the director's son?

25:58.889 --> 26:01.230
To be honest, I
still can't believe it

26:02.159 --> 26:03.359
director

26:04.230 --> 26:05.969
a truly good man

26:08.869 --> 26:11.600
Such a good life gave birth to a son

26:12.869 --> 26:14.010
How to do it?

26:15.740 --> 26:16.939
from the other side

26:17.879 --> 26:20.909
I also pray that guy is really the culprit

26:22.050 --> 26:23.219
Why?

26:25.379 --> 26:28.350
If so, the suspect has been captured

26:29.219 --> 26:30.389
it's all over

26:31.290 --> 26:32.830
other people..

26:33.959 --> 26:37.060
I don't feel like my child anymore

26:38.429 --> 26:40.129
to anyone in the world

26:41.129 --> 26:42.439
no family

26:47.439 --> 26:48.609
like this

26:50.209 --> 26:52.040
I don't want to feel it

26:54.280 --> 26:55.580
Mr. Yin

26:56.820 --> 26:59.189
Thank you very much again

27:00.219 --> 27:01.719
thank you for catching me

27:02.959 --> 27:06.730
thank you so much for ending it

27:09.899 --> 27:10.899
Yes

27:14.070 --> 27:15.270
No evidence?

27:16.199 --> 27:17.240
Why?

27:18.199 --> 27:20.209
I remember my father's handwriting

27:22.310 --> 27:23.379
No

27:24.040 --> 27:25.709
I've never seen my father's handwriting

27:38.419 --> 27:39.429
grandfather

27:39.959 --> 27:41.059
What's this?

27:41.060 --> 27:43.730
He said he can study now

27:44.129 --> 27:46.730
My father sent me oil, grandpa

27:49.199 --> 27:50.369
(From Yoon Yoon Woo to Yoon Hae Joon)

27:51.939 --> 27:55.169
(Dear son Hae Joon comes)

27:56.109 --> 27:58.010
Such a disgusting guy

28:07.320 --> 28:08.550
just know

28:11.820 --> 28:13.730
I knew everything then

28:43.060 --> 28:44.060
Heejun

28:44.619 --> 28:45.619
(Zhou Airlines)

28:45.620 --> 28:47.189
(I hope you will definitely use the diary I gave you as a gift)

28:47.530 --> 28:49.500
how did you do it?

28:51.500 --> 28:52.699
What are you doing?

28:53.699 --> 28:54.869
Haejun, that's...

28:57.540 --> 28:59.469
Defendant's handwritten witness

29:00.169 --> 29:02.909
Why not burn it all?

29:04.810 --> 29:05.810
I know

29:07.280 --> 29:08.850
I know this is crazy

29:09.949 --> 29:12.349
I know it's a big sin, but

29:12.350 --> 29:13.419
But what?

29:14.820 --> 29:17.289
The rest of your life
depends on it

29:17.290 --> 29:18.820
Because it depends on your future

29:18.919 --> 29:20.030
i can't do anything

29:20.790 --> 29:23.100
To me this is your
best choice

29:24.929 --> 29:28.629
Now that the baby is in the mother's belly, you...

29:29.869 --> 29:32.539
Born the son of a murderer who killed three people

29:32.540 --> 29:34.070
what should I do?

29:34.540 --> 29:36.240
Can I watch this?

29:37.280 --> 29:38.310
Haijun

29:39.550 --> 29:41.310
I will take all the blame

29:41.480 --> 29:44.149
Even if I go to hell, I
will bear all the sins

29:45.020 --> 29:47.090
It's like you don't know anything

29:47.490 --> 29:49.520
Can't you just live like everyone else
?

29:50.389 --> 29:52.589
Don't let him
do something good that disgusts you next time

29:52.590 --> 29:54.830
Because I will stop everything

29:59.869 --> 30:02.699
That's what I did

30:04.340 --> 30:06.409
you cover it all

30:07.770 --> 30:09.580
This is how everything happened

30:13.850 --> 30:14.909
if you do

30:15.709 --> 30:17.119
If you throw away this cover

30:18.119 --> 30:20.449
Do you think I can live well in your mind?

30:23.260 --> 30:25.459
Don't make excuses for my future

30:26.629 --> 30:29.330
Covering everything
, unable to relax

30:29.500 --> 30:32.929
It's because of your life that you turned a blind eye to that son's son

30:35.169 --> 30:36.240
lifetime

30:38.439 --> 30:42.070
I've been looking at your cold back all my life

30:44.209 --> 30:47.250
no no

30:51.080 --> 30:52.619
Even if I know this future

30:54.919 --> 30:56.389
Would you still choose this way?

31:30.889 --> 31:33.929
I even saw a bus in front of the grocery store

31:34.260 --> 31:35.559
guess where

31:35.560 --> 31:38.359
Well, it doesn't matter,
I won't look for it anymore

31:39.570 --> 31:40.570
Why?

31:40.699 --> 31:43.969
Teacher Yin Haijun
just arrived

31:44.240 --> 31:46.708
what are you saying? Why is he in hospital now
?

31:46.709 --> 31:49.639
Defendant Yun Wulei's handwriting

31:49.810 --> 31:51.240
He came and gave evidence

31:52.010 --> 31:54.148
Did you find the evidence?

31:54.149 --> 31:56.719
Well
I think I can finish it

31:56.980 --> 32:00.649
Thanks to him, I think we will be able to catch the real culprit this time

32:22.609 --> 32:24.379
Didn't you ask where you came back from?

32:26.350 --> 32:27.510
I heard it all

32:34.520 --> 32:37.060
Can I not be discharged from the hospital now that I am fine
?

32:37.689 --> 32:39.759
Certainly not yet

32:39.760 --> 32:41.659
I want to go home now

32:46.669 --> 32:49.199
Grandpa says thank you

32:54.040 --> 32:56.109
right in front of the grocery store

32:56.709 --> 32:59.709
I met the owner of Bom Bom teahouse

33:01.750 --> 33:04.219
Which bus to take?

33:05.419 --> 33:09.090
I didn't even think about parking

33:10.790 --> 33:13.290
I just keep looking at something

33:18.359 --> 33:20.070
Are you going on a long trip?

33:23.439 --> 33:24.469
Yes

33:24.840 --> 33:27.010
It will take time for the first car to arrive

33:27.439 --> 33:28.609
great whale whale

33:29.439 --> 33:31.909
I'll open the door in a moment, so
stay inside

33:32.080 --> 33:33.250
It doesn't matter

33:33.810 --> 33:36.550
Sister, I can do that too

33:37.619 --> 33:39.080
After losing my daughter

33:39.590 --> 33:41.790
Worry about the world

33:43.219 --> 33:46.929
But the culprit
was still caught, right?

33:49.959 --> 33:51.030
Yes

33:54.770 --> 33:57.000
She is very pretty

33:59.770 --> 34:03.879
Holding baby socks for a long time

34:05.179 --> 34:06.949
I finally went up

34:08.909 --> 34:10.480
your mother

34:17.219 --> 34:18.560
did you know?

34:22.630 --> 34:25.259
Should I check where it went?

34:27.230 --> 34:30.440
no i can

34:49.589 --> 34:52.118
I heard that the suspect in the Wu Zongri serial murder case has been arrested

34:52.119 --> 34:54.060
Briefly introduce the current status of the case

35:00.299 --> 35:01.400
Yes

35:02.500 --> 35:05.670
Our police have spent the past five months

35:05.969 --> 35:09.440
Three murders in Wuzhengli Village

35:10.009 --> 35:12.008
two assassination plots

35:12.009 --> 35:15.080
The suspect was successfully captured

35:15.880 --> 35:18.649
The suspect Yun’s family
studied abroad for a long time

35:18.650 --> 35:20.388
A 20-year-old student

35:20.389 --> 35:23.420
Because the criminal warrant has also
expired.

35:23.560 --> 35:25.020
Yun family arrested

35:25.259 --> 35:28.059
After a thorough investigation into the intent and actions of the murder

35:28.060 --> 35:29.759
will be handed over to investigators

35:29.960 --> 35:32.459
my God

35:32.460 --> 35:36.638
The director's son was born from a silkworm

35:36.639 --> 35:39.000
You say that guy is the real culprit?

35:39.810 --> 35:42.939
Wisdom and Peace and Prosperity

35:42.940 --> 35:45.979
Not enough people have everything

35:45.980 --> 35:47.778
Why do such a despicable act?

35:47.779 --> 35:48.948
- Ms.
- Ms.

35:48.949 --> 35:51.278
Can a poor man do it?

35:51.279 --> 35:54.319
- It's not that.
- It's not that.

35:54.350 --> 35:57.190
My daughter was born like a
bug

35:57.659 --> 35:59.560
those words

35:59.960 --> 36:01.429
- Madam, this person is
- Madam

36:02.960 --> 36:04.159
Miss

36:11.100 --> 36:14.439
The suspect in the Oh Jong-il serial murder case that happened one month ago

36:14.440 --> 36:16.139
He has been arrested and detained

36:16.710 --> 36:19.379
For worried villagers,
it's a nightmare

36:19.380 --> 36:21.049
- It's over
- Really

36:21.350 --> 36:23.150
Reporter Kim Sun-woo

36:23.779 --> 36:27.588
The Wujingri serial murder case that occurred last month

36:27.589 --> 36:30.520
The suspect Yin Yin
was arrested and taken to the police station

36:31.020 --> 36:33.059
Yunshi in camera lighting

36:33.060 --> 36:34.889
He was taken to the interrogation room

36:35.190 --> 36:38.229
Although suspect Yoon Soo denied involvement in the murder

36:38.230 --> 36:41.669
Police found writing at the murder scene

36:41.670 --> 36:43.568
It can be considered that the handwriting of the Yun family matches

36:43.569 --> 36:45.869
It has been announced that the evidence has been obtained

36:49.569 --> 36:51.509
I think it's all done now

36:53.210 --> 36:57.049
I think I've done all I can here since the culprit was also caught

36:58.650 --> 37:00.250
The car has been repaired

37:01.449 --> 37:05.060
now we have to go back

37:07.130 --> 37:08.460
Shall we go out?

37:09.130 --> 37:11.429
You can't live forever as a non-existent person

37:12.900 --> 37:14.730
The future of change must also
be tested

37:20.069 --> 37:22.210
Father, mother and family members

37:22.569 --> 37:24.409
Because I still need time to say goodbye

37:27.810 --> 37:29.850
How about going out tomorrow night?

37:36.690 --> 37:37.719
Excellent

37:38.889 --> 37:40.060
I did this

38:01.850 --> 38:02.980
Do you want it?

38:08.750 --> 38:10.060
I do not want to go

38:11.659 --> 38:14.389
Have you not contacted my father yet
?

38:30.009 --> 38:33.509
Believe me, I'll avoid it for a while, so
I'll talk it out

38:35.710 --> 38:36.719
Yes

38:51.799 --> 38:54.068
I wonder who this lucky guy will be

38:54.069 --> 38:55.729
Finally, it happens to you

38:55.730 --> 38:59.169
There is always money in front of the store and plenty of toothpaste

38:59.170 --> 39:00.270
very good

39:00.610 --> 39:01.809
What gift did you receive from your boyfriend?

39:01.810 --> 39:03.239
- do you have a boyfriend?
- do you have a boyfriend?

39:08.679 --> 39:09.709
ha

39:09.710 --> 39:10.879
- Not yet
- Ha

39:10.880 --> 39:12.679
- If you don't buy again
- it's too late

39:17.759 --> 39:18.819
Are you crazy?

39:19.159 --> 39:20.730
Is 200,000 a bit too much?

39:21.259 --> 39:22.960
Why are you doing this to me?

39:23.799 --> 39:25.500
you don't have enough money

39:29.130 --> 39:31.770
Did you steal the teacher's money?

39:32.199 --> 39:34.270
- If it slips, it's me..
- Hey

39:36.139 --> 39:37.609
Because I was told that if I was late I would have to pay back the money

39:37.610 --> 39:40.150
Without saying a word, he picked up the guitar and left.

39:40.610 --> 39:42.179
My ears hurt like hell

39:44.219 --> 39:45.279
ha

39:50.190 --> 39:52.690
It's really you now

40:02.270 --> 40:04.540
- Thank you, guest
- Madam

40:05.969 --> 40:09.239
(Sun and Moon Record Store)

40:13.710 --> 40:14.810
Miss

40:32.060 --> 40:33.270
Unless you're not

40:35.330 --> 40:37.299
With the feeling I like...

40:50.319 --> 40:51.480
Just a bribe

40:58.589 --> 40:59.759
forward

41:00.790 --> 41:03.230
I wish my best friend Sun Ai all the best for the rest of his life

41:04.029 --> 41:07.000
If you make Shan'e
cry once

41:08.170 --> 41:10.469
I won't put it here

41:11.699 --> 41:13.569
Bribe or threat?

41:14.469 --> 41:16.710
I'll look into it myself

41:16.909 --> 41:17.940
Why are you..

41:20.009 --> 41:21.779
What a nuisance

41:23.850 --> 41:26.319
I said they will always be by each other's side, never separated

41:29.350 --> 41:30.360
this is me

41:31.889 --> 41:33.730
Because we can see you again

41:38.060 --> 41:39.230
where are you going?

41:43.639 --> 41:45.369
see you soon

41:49.210 --> 41:51.210
It may take you longer

41:52.639 --> 41:54.110
what are you saying?

41:55.779 --> 41:58.420
But you
're not the one with the headache anymore?

42:02.089 --> 42:03.659
He doesn't seem to have a fever

42:09.790 --> 42:10.830
ok let's go

42:18.440 --> 42:20.909
I don't feel well

42:44.429 --> 42:46.429
Dad, I must do it this time

42:49.069 --> 42:50.239
without illness

42:52.270 --> 42:53.639
no harm

42:56.739 --> 42:58.679
Customize everything you want

43:10.259 --> 43:12.020
Why do you really want to kill me?

43:13.860 --> 43:15.989
This is what I want to continue to ask

43:19.699 --> 43:21.400
now we will never know

43:23.069 --> 43:25.369
Because the future that could kill me
has disappeared

46:02.560 --> 46:03.560

Then do it again

46:10.770 --> 46:11.799
let's kill it

46:13.170 --> 46:14.869
No matter how far you live

46:16.610 --> 46:19.110
I didn't realize there were other forms

46:20.880 --> 46:21.880
What

46:22.380 --> 46:23.819
clear proof

46:25.880 --> 46:27.989

46:29.089 --> 46:30.319
I would like to know

46:38.130 --> 46:41.199
(I hope you will definitely use the diary I gave you as a gift)

46:41.670 --> 46:43.069
you are a smart person

46:44.299 --> 46:47.770
You didn't leave any footprints at the scene

46:48.909 --> 46:50.409
Why did you miss it?

46:51.679 --> 46:54.179
Just knowing that you will definitely become a witness
is enough

46:55.250 --> 46:56.679
That woman and that...

46:57.520 --> 47:00.449
I knew I could end it all

Why did you leave it to that woman?

47:11.159 --> 47:12.500
Have you ever loved?

47:18.540 --> 47:20.969
I asked a very unexpected question

47:23.009 --> 47:25.980
Why and how did he kill?

47:26.739 --> 47:28.310
I thought I would ask

47:34.049 --> 47:35.150
Is this love?

47:38.360 --> 47:39.389
i love it

47:40.460 --> 47:42.130
i love it

47:43.159 --> 47:45.560
I thought he was the one who could make my dream come true

47:48.600 --> 47:50.440
Because he thought things would be different

47:52.540 --> 47:53.670
I used to know

47:55.409 --> 47:57.080
Than a cruel woman

47:59.779 --> 48:01.750
I remember that woman's face

48:02.409 --> 48:04.219
I usually read books

48:05.380 --> 48:07.690
once Upon a time

48:08.489 --> 48:12.089
He never looked at me with warm eyes

48:13.489 --> 48:16.488
Finally
when I was 7 years old

48:16.489 --> 48:18.060
("Nesach")

48:19.130 --> 48:20.400
i left home

48:21.900 --> 48:24.900
Then I said I don't want to be my mother anymore

48:33.679 --> 48:34.750
I..

48:36.549 --> 48:38.219
Am I going to see my mother?

48:41.049 --> 48:42.089
Mother

48:43.250 --> 48:45.659
Did you hear from mom?

49:09.909 --> 49:11.619
more than anyone else

49:12.949 --> 49:14.750
From someone who will absolutely love you

49:15.089 --> 49:16.719
Abandoned

49:18.159 --> 49:19.589
You know that feeling?

49:21.029 --> 49:23.759
I miss the person who abandoned me every day

49:24.230 --> 49:27.000
cried all night

49:28.130 --> 49:30.000
in endless pain

49:30.940 --> 49:32.139
I agreed

49:34.839 --> 49:36.270
next time

49:37.440 --> 49:38.779
if i had a child

49:42.810 --> 49:43.880
to my son

49:45.350 --> 49:48.350
My son will never be like me

49:49.520 --> 49:52.659
I met a woman who loves her children more than anyone else

49:55.060 --> 49:56.690
As long as you are happy

49:59.460 --> 50:00.730
That's why I found it

50:01.830 --> 50:02.929
Such a woman

50:04.639 --> 50:05.699
That woman...

50:07.339 --> 50:08.440
orphan

50:09.469 --> 50:12.639
A woman who really wants a family

50:15.279 --> 50:17.219
Did you know this was going to happen?

50:20.250 --> 50:23.089
- What
- you want to create so much

50:23.989 --> 50:26.719
perfect happiness,
perfect family

50:28.460 --> 50:30.830
Do you know it was destroyed by your own hands?

50:31.730 --> 50:33.029
What's that word?

50:34.699 --> 50:35.869
That's why it's still good

50:37.000 --> 50:38.500
from people like you

50:39.270 --> 50:41.569
my mother escaped

50:58.889 --> 50:59.889
you..

51:01.889 --> 51:03.389
Unless you're not...

51:11.799 --> 51:12.969
impossible

51:15.610 --> 51:17.409
if you really are my son

51:18.940 --> 51:21.810
you can't do this to
me

51:23.210 --> 51:25.219
How could I kill you?

51:25.980 --> 51:28.549
With a despicable father like you

51:29.319 --> 51:31.860
Abandoned from birth, I
tell you

51:33.290 --> 51:35.560
what you have said so far

51:37.560 --> 51:40.330
The victim’s feelings and the murderer’s
speechless

51:40.569 --> 51:42.969
Just false words

51:45.569 --> 51:49.040
So go ahead and spend
all your time doing this for the rest of your life

51:49.969 --> 51:52.940
Get trapped,
feel the pain, and survive

51:55.580 --> 51:57.419
This is what makes you want to have kids so bad

51:57.420 --> 51:59.920
These are the last words you say as a son

52:53.500 --> 52:54.610
- Mr. Yin
-Ms.

52:56.670 --> 52:57.738
- Yes
ma'am

52:57.739 --> 53:00.079
Why are they going out?
Is there a problem?

53:00.080 --> 53:01.779
So, is it possible to live without problems?

53:02.210 --> 53:04.549
I'm moving tonight

53:04.949 --> 53:07.690
Why did it suddenly happen without any warning?

53:08.250 --> 53:10.690
I am really sorry

53:10.889 --> 53:13.860
- Yes
- I'm very sorry, sir.

53:14.029 --> 53:16.589
How to do what I consider a family thing
..

53:31.940 --> 53:34.610
we will really meet again

53:35.380 --> 53:36.610
when

53:37.880 --> 53:39.250
Where

53:41.949 --> 53:43.889
34 years old

53:44.920 --> 53:46.060
at your home

53:48.330 --> 53:50.159
i really hate you

53:52.330 --> 53:55.369
Instead,
try saying you won't see each other for the rest of your lives

53:56.529 --> 53:58.940
Try to say you won't see me again

54:01.569 --> 54:03.810
let us wait no longer

54:10.480 --> 54:11.920
around that time

54:14.790 --> 54:17.690
Although it's a little different now

54:21.529 --> 54:23.759
I really like this face too

54:27.569 --> 54:28.730
That face too

54:30.429 --> 54:31.900
i miss it very much

54:37.170 --> 54:40.440
I think it's great to be here

54:42.480 --> 54:43.580
current

54:45.719 --> 54:48.020
Because I can see you now

54:50.790 --> 54:52.690
i can take it back

54:55.960 --> 54:57.860
I think it's really good

55:08.770 --> 55:09.909
Me too

55:14.009 --> 55:15.110
Me too

55:19.580 --> 55:21.420
I'm very pleased to meet you..

55:22.850 --> 55:24.020
I was very happy then

55:52.380 --> 55:53.420
Thanks

55:58.259 --> 56:00.259
Thank you Mr. Yin

56:00.830 --> 56:02.529
Because he is my neighbor

56:03.259 --> 56:05.929
- Thank you very much
- Yes

56:08.369 --> 56:10.170
thanks for saying that

56:10.400 --> 56:11.400
Miss

56:12.040 --> 56:16.210
Thank you very much sisters for helping me

56:16.940 --> 56:18.040
That's cool

56:18.440 --> 56:21.679
Can't you tell me where you're going?

56:22.480 --> 56:25.880
Now
let us know it must be somewhere

56:26.420 --> 56:28.020
no matter where

56:29.389 --> 56:32.960
a bit too far

56:34.529 --> 56:36.929
Stay healthy and live longer

56:37.060 --> 56:39.699
I will continue to see you

56:58.080 --> 56:59.949
we really left

57:01.520 --> 57:02.589
Yes, sir

57:03.619 --> 57:05.759
Time travel long after

57:06.489 --> 57:07.860
a little excited

57:14.330 --> 57:15.730
Are you not immune?

57:16.100 --> 57:17.199
What?

57:17.600 --> 57:19.900
He came back without saying goodbye

57:21.409 --> 57:23.369
grandfather and mother

57:24.040 --> 57:28.380
Especially with my mom,
I don't know if this is the last time I'll be here

57:29.750 --> 57:31.850
I'm not here to see them

57:33.449 --> 57:35.250
That's it, I've seen it a lot

57:36.520 --> 57:37.690
enough

57:44.759 --> 57:46.758
What will you do first when you come back?

57:46.759 --> 57:47.929
what do you want to do?

57:48.730 --> 57:50.028
Iced Caramel Macchiato

57:50.029 --> 57:52.270
Let's have a drink of something very sweet

57:52.500 --> 57:55.310
Do you know how delicious it tastes with salty bread?

57:56.239 --> 57:59.080
Really like sweet and salty

58:37.949 --> 58:39.920
so exciting

58:40.520 --> 58:41.750
Don't worry

58:42.449 --> 58:44.659
It's over in the blink of an eye

58:47.489 --> 58:49.159
Once you pass this cave

58:50.130 --> 58:52.499
Just like lying on our home field

58:52.500 --> 58:54.900
Will return in 2021

58:56.969 --> 58:59.299
OK, let's go

59:41.279 --> 59:42.509
Are you there yet?

59:43.480 --> 59:44.650
Are you there yet?

59:49.020 --> 59:50.190
Is it 2021?

59:51.020 --> 59:52.790
Smoother than expected

59:54.020 --> 59:56.360
I'm not sure if I'll be back after a long time

59:57.560 --> 59:59.400
Yes, this year is 2021

01:00:01.199 --> 01:00:02.869
Yes or no?

01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:12.309
- Mr. Yin-
Yes, yes

01:00:12.310 --> 01:00:14.710
Hey Mr. Yin

01:00:21.949 --> 01:00:25.259
Didn’t I say I
would be a news anchor in 2021?

01:00:46.139 --> 01:00:48.980
June 14, 1987

01:00:49.409 --> 01:00:51.350
10:40pm

01:00:51.619 --> 01:00:55.119
We
've made everything perfect here

01:00:55.589 --> 01:00:58.860
I tried to leave, but
I stayed here like before

01:00:59.889 --> 01:01:01.790
Say we are forever...

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:05.130
Is fate trapped here?

01:01:14.569 --> 01:01:16.440
(The finale will be broadcast at 9:50 pm tomorrow)

01:01:46.639 --> 01:01:50.270
(a stranger I met)
