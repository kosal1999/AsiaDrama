00:40.770 --> 00:44.009
"The Stranger I Met"
Part 2

00:45.609 --> 00:48.149
Looking back,
it was a strange night

00:48.480 --> 00:51.550
Unreasonable weather
awareness navigation system

00:51.920 --> 00:53.190
There's also a phone

00:53.889 --> 00:56.490
Just then it appeared in front of me

00:56.959 --> 01:00.459
There I wrote about how to use a time travel machine

01:00.630 --> 01:04.029
I'm talking about the time travel machine in novels and movies

01:04.270 --> 01:07.740
Have you ever imagined a world without my mother?

01:07.940 --> 01:11.038
Even if you call me "Mom" in this world

01:11.039 --> 01:12.739
No reason to reply

01:12.740 --> 01:16.439
From now on, next year,
when I am 35, I will die

01:16.440 --> 01:19.308
This is the man who killed me in 1987

01:19.309 --> 01:22.050
Because Wu Zongri is the culprit of the serial murders

01:22.280 --> 01:24.449
This also appeared at the scene of my death

01:24.520 --> 01:26.750
This is the logo of the defendant in 1987

01:35.899 --> 01:36.899
Mother

01:38.399 --> 01:41.470
We arrived in 1987

01:41.640 --> 01:43.500
There is no way to go back

01:43.740 --> 01:45.270
I'm stuck here

03:24.940 --> 03:28.038
KSBC news anchor
Yoon Hye-joon believed to have been killed

03:28.039 --> 03:30.079
They were surprised to find this scene

03:30.609 --> 03:33.709
Based on DNA test results from blood spots found at the scene

03:33.710 --> 03:35.549
It has been confirmed that it is the blood of news anchor Yin

03:35.979 --> 03:38.619
Because the position of news anchor Yin
has not been determined yet

03:38.620 --> 03:41.660
They are considering murder without a body

03:43.560 --> 03:45.689

has been missing for a week)

05:17.950 --> 05:20.150
how are you today?

05:24.160 --> 05:25.260
Oh oh

05:25.890 --> 05:28.159
How are you? Your forehead is fine too. .

05:28.160 --> 05:29.700
Yes, no problem

05:33.299 --> 05:34.330
divine water

05:36.200 --> 05:37.869
Why can't I separate my head and my heart today?

05:40.369 --> 05:42.210
Carefully keep your shoulders forward

Sorry,
I'll explain everything

gentlemen

06:21.249 --> 06:22.950
Although surprised

06:23.479 --> 06:26.350
The current situation is worse than people imagine

06:40.030 --> 06:41.770
I'm stuck here

06:48.010 --> 06:49.109
Really?

are you laughing?

07:32.390 --> 07:33.850
Do you hit your head often?

07:34.859 --> 07:36.160
It is not

07:37.720 --> 07:40.229
How are you?

07:56.939 --> 07:59.809
Now what if you say?

08:00.879 --> 08:03.979
Is my mother still alive now?

08:04.179 --> 08:05.189

09:12.790 --> 09:15.220
Where is the bathroom?

09:52.659 --> 09:55.999

10:35.540 --> 10:37.470

10:44.879 --> 10:46.249

My daughter Yunying

11:23.080 --> 11:24.649
Are not you afraid?

11:27.389 --> 11:28.719
Why did you leave like this?

11:28.720 --> 11:30.659
How will my daughter live now?

11:32.659 --> 11:35.330
sorry

11:38.570 --> 11:40.070
sorry mom

11:41.070 --> 11:44.340
No, daughter,
it’s very embarrassing outside today.

11:45.769 --> 11:49.440
My daughter
pretends not to know because she is sad

11:50.210 --> 11:51.649
To my daughter Amy

11:52.779 --> 11:55.649
I'm ashamed to show my face

11:58.080 --> 11:59.320
that's why i do it

12:13.170 --> 12:14.940
Mom, this is wrong

12:16.600 --> 12:17.739
my daughter..

12:19.040 --> 12:20.970
I think there's still a lot of time

12:21.909 --> 12:24.310
I think a mother will wait for her daughter

12:32.450 --> 12:34.850
Really exactly the same, mom

12:58.749 --> 12:59.850
acre..

13:03.920 --> 13:05.389
If not, do you remember your daughter?

13:05.950 --> 13:07.190
do you remember me?

13:07.690 --> 13:08.758
- Yes
- I opened my eyes

13:08.759 --> 13:10.988
My mother is the treasure of our village

No more dying on the streets

13:18.060 --> 13:20.228
I didn't hit it, but blood came out

13:20.229 --> 13:21.638
I think I have to take him to the hospital

13:21.639 --> 13:23.700
- Yes
- That's it

13:23.869 --> 13:25.810
Because I have someone I'm looking for

13:26.509 --> 13:27.509
Mother

13:27.510 --> 13:29.478
- I'm not dead yet
, sir.

13:29.479 --> 13:32.009
What would happen if you died trying to save our children ?

13:32.580 --> 13:35.018
Remember last month’s superglue case?

13:35.019 --> 13:36.079
Mr. Yin, do you still remember?

13:36.080 --> 13:37.680
Hey, it won't happen again, Khonpo

13:37.779 --> 13:39.419
Yes, landing

13:39.420 --> 13:40.719
- Oh no.
- Get on his back.

13:40.720 --> 13:41.988
-I'm alive.
-Hurry up.

13:41.989 --> 13:43.888
- Lying on your back
- Be careful when lying on your back

13:43.889 --> 13:45.889
- Almost

13:48.060 --> 13:49.729
tell me what happened

13:51.300 --> 13:52.369
acre..

13:59.070 --> 14:00.710
Do you use super glue?

14:04.279 --> 14:05.478
What's that word?

14:05.479 --> 14:07.878
Did you really hit me?

14:07.879 --> 14:10.119
I just want to go home

14:11.619 --> 14:12.889
Mother

14:14.249 --> 14:17.190
How is my mother?
Why did my daughter hit my mother?

14:17.519 --> 14:19.259
Mother

14:20.629 --> 14:22.729
Mother and daughter Yunying

14:23.330 --> 14:24.800

Oh ~ my love

14:33.139 --> 14:37.508
If there is a breeze open the window

14:37.509 --> 14:42.079
Let your moonlight smile shine brightly

14:42.080 --> 14:46.019
My fun dream came true

14:47.119 --> 14:48.119

14:48.690 --> 14:50.159

14:52.159 --> 14:53.629
stop all

14:56.529 --> 14:58.158
- What is
- Ha

14:58.159 --> 15:01.430
Now, from now on, I'm going to find a minor

15:01.800 --> 15:04.639
All registered personnel have been released

15:04.800 --> 15:05.909
non-existent person

15:06.970 --> 15:08.478
Let's admit it and go camping

15:08.479 --> 15:09.939
- Get out quickly
- Get out

15:09.940 --> 15:11.639

15:27.090 --> 15:28.128
indeed

15:28.129 --> 15:30.459
My head is bleeding too

15:30.460 --> 15:33.498
There is a tie with a red dot around the neck

15:33.499 --> 15:35.340
- Absolutely too..
- Stop

15:36.170 --> 15:38.300
- Where
- Priest

15:39.239 --> 15:40.368
Oh, Chairman

15:40.369 --> 15:41.669
Oh yes, yes

15:41.670 --> 15:42.878
Where do you find it?

15:42.879 --> 15:44.540
Where did that red tie go?

15:45.109 --> 15:46.249
This way

15:48.210 --> 15:49.849
Mother

15:49.850 --> 15:51.619
you can't go in there

15:52.090 --> 15:54.519
My brother is here today

15:55.259 --> 15:56.989
- Domshi?
- Yes

15:59.560 --> 16:01.590
Thank you all for your cooperation

16:02.060 --> 16:04.729
Sign up in advance and
be prepared

16:09.670 --> 16:10.769
Are you sure you don't want to mention it?

16:12.070 --> 16:14.409
What are you doing?

16:14.670 --> 16:15.779
Don't you know when you saw it?

16:16.180 --> 16:17.540
Check registration

16:17.979 --> 16:19.050
Take it out quickly

16:19.109 --> 16:21.479
If you don't want to go to the police station with them

16:22.149 --> 16:25.489
Are they all registered using this form?

16:26.619 --> 16:28.319
Is it because the registration method is different?

16:28.320 --> 16:31.320
This is the line

16:38.869 --> 16:41.940
Now I'm using a word that I find difficult

16:46.340 --> 16:47.369
sorry

17:21.010 --> 17:22.980
What are these girls doing here?

17:24.639 --> 17:27.780
- teacher
- teacher

17:28.679 --> 17:29.780
teacher

17:29.850 --> 17:31.888
I said all this to wake up

17:31.889 --> 17:33.750
Can seniors go to nightclubs?

17:34.020 --> 17:35.090
Come out of here quickly

17:35.389 --> 17:37.319
teacher

17:37.320 --> 17:39.290
Please forgive me

17:39.429 --> 17:40.858
- Advanced
- Sorry

17:40.859 --> 17:42.458
- Teacher
- What are you doing?

17:42.459 --> 17:43.459
Coming out soon

17:44.330 --> 17:45.429
teacher

17:45.830 --> 17:48.429
- He's not from our school.
- Yes, you are.

17:48.669 --> 17:50.300
What are you pretending not to know?

17:55.939 --> 17:57.309
teacher

17:57.310 --> 17:59.080
what do you do now?

18:03.179 --> 18:04.379
Badong Eight Detectives

18:05.689 --> 18:07.389
five days later

18:07.889 --> 18:10.719
Two murders and a missing person

18:11.790 --> 18:14.560
He suddenly quit his hard-working
detective job

18:14.830 --> 18:17.300
This is the man who left the village and disappeared

18:18.000 --> 18:20.669
That counts as thirty years

18:29.240 --> 18:30.240
action?

18:31.439 --> 18:33.309
The teacher will lead the students

18:33.310 --> 18:35.719
Is that how it's described?

18:39.389 --> 18:41.719
The police will take away the criminals

18:42.359 --> 18:44.560
This is impossible to enter

18:45.429 --> 18:49.199
Don't think about calling young people and threatening them with criminals

18:50.300 --> 18:53.570
Make sure only the real criminals are caught

18:55.469 --> 18:56.540
What

18:57.169 --> 19:00.409
Things are so complicated because we can't be sure

19:01.340 --> 19:02.409
Now..

19:04.310 --> 19:05.580
what does that mean?

19:14.050 --> 19:16.520
my mom is in trouble

19:17.119 --> 19:19.260
- Madam Chairman
- Yes

19:20.830 --> 19:23.600
alone with a child

19:24.159 --> 19:26.929
I can't go home until midnight

19:27.500 --> 19:28.939
This is no longer the case

19:29.399 --> 19:33.069
- I am from Su Wu, battalion commander
- look at the pattern

19:33.070 --> 19:35.240
- Little girl unconscious
- Father

19:35.270 --> 19:37.809
- It's not like that.
- I'll let you go home.

19:37.810 --> 19:39.179
go back

19:39.379 --> 19:40.509
I will send it

19:40.510 --> 19:42.319
- Oh, is it so?
- Yes

19:42.320 --> 19:44.618
So, after staying for a long time,
should I take a police car?

19:44.619 --> 19:46.490
yes, yes, of course

19:47.449 --> 19:48.520
so

19:50.020 --> 19:53.159
They arrived at the principal's office before eight o'clock on Monday morning

19:55.129 --> 19:56.958
- Let's go.
- Okay, let's go.

19:56.959 --> 19:57.959
Yes

19:59.399 --> 20:01.368
-Follow

20:01.369 --> 20:03.199
Father

20:17.119 --> 20:18.219
Detective Barker

20:18.449 --> 20:20.090
Yes, I'm here, Chairman.

20:36.070 --> 20:38.468
(moon night)

20:38.469 --> 20:39.939
Thank you
and wish you all the best

20:49.219 --> 20:50.250
oh

20:55.590 --> 20:57.060
Where are you going now?

20:58.389 --> 21:00.229
Saved the wrong people and
got away with it

21:00.230 --> 21:01.859
Can't solve it

21:03.260 --> 21:04.830
So who is it?

21:12.000 --> 21:14.070
Now you want to know?

21:15.510 --> 21:17.780
I'm not very close to people now

21:19.449 --> 21:20.948
The current situation is better than this

21:20.949 --> 21:23.079
Because it is very professional

21:23.080 --> 21:25.019
A man who knows how to be very special

21:25.020 --> 21:26.689
Just take a walk?

21:27.149 --> 21:28.350
Are you really here to visit?

21:29.060 --> 21:31.219
Why did you actually join the club?

21:31.520 --> 21:32.590
That is..

21:39.369 --> 21:40.699
that side and that side

21:42.169 --> 21:45.708
Because what people are really doing at this moment

21:45.709 --> 21:47.840
Why is it so natural?

22:10.500 --> 22:11.500
correct?

22:12.030 --> 22:13.469
The guy who hit me with his car

22:16.369 --> 22:18.269
what is the real point

22:18.270 --> 22:20.240
I don't know why I notice it now

22:21.169 --> 22:23.580
Well, that's right

22:26.850 --> 22:27.949
Already following

22:28.609 --> 22:30.320
It would be faster to go and see for yourself

22:39.929 --> 22:43.030
So this is no ordinary car, it's
a time travel machine

22:43.699 --> 22:45.260
Time travel is over there

22:45.869 --> 22:48.100
I was hit by this car

22:48.629 --> 22:51.639
It arrived in 1987,
right?

22:54.669 --> 22:56.939
- This is stupid
- This is stupid

22:58.179 --> 23:01.010
After seeing such a situation,
can you still speak like this?

23:01.709 --> 23:03.879
The current situation is not caused by me

23:09.290 --> 23:10.719
Why didn't I think of this?

23:12.189 --> 23:13.929
Why do you think this is my problem?

23:16.129 --> 23:17.330
Why fight?

23:18.699 --> 23:19.699
what happened

23:19.700 --> 23:22.500
What is actually being done and in what way
?

23:23.270 --> 23:24.638
Is there anything you can do if you get hit by a car?

23:24.639 --> 23:26.570
The driver came and hit
me

23:27.010 --> 23:29.379
No, I say that because I'm not sure

23:29.609 --> 23:32.080
This is not a car that hits things

23:32.850 --> 23:34.649
This is totally insightful

23:35.149 --> 23:39.020
At least twice a day for the past two months

23:39.090 --> 23:41.148
Although I have been here many times

23:41.149 --> 23:42.790
never been like this

23:43.459 --> 23:45.520
Being beaten wasn't enough, so
I came too.

23:47.060 --> 23:49.260
What will really change
?

23:52.469 --> 23:53.500
Change

23:59.040 --> 24:00.240
Have you ever thought about it?

24:05.310 --> 24:07.409
Isn't a song a song?

24:08.080 --> 24:10.649
- What
- Yes, this is Lin Sannu's song

24:11.250 --> 24:13.550
The sound is so loud that even
outsiders can hear it

24:17.820 --> 24:20.230
My heart is wrapped in silk

24:22.699 --> 24:23.859
What does it matter?

24:24.100 --> 24:25.699
Did you call Aicante?

24:25.929 --> 24:26.969
what phone?

24:37.909 --> 24:39.079
(speaker)

24:39.080 --> 24:40.080
Yes

24:42.580 --> 24:44.179
what's up hello

24:51.419 --> 24:52.859
it keeps going on

24:53.859 --> 24:55.529
during normal driving

24:55.530 --> 24:57.730
Wouldn't it be easier to crash if you did this?

24:58.230 --> 25:00.770
No,
this is not a car that will fight from the start

25:02.540 --> 25:04.199
Insurance can't solve it here

25:04.639 --> 25:06.340
We had a quarrel, what are you going to do?

25:08.040 --> 25:09.040
ha

25:09.709 --> 25:12.040
I asked if I could get help fixing it

25:13.609 --> 25:15.080
Is there somewhere I can go back to?

25:15.449 --> 25:16.820
Here is the teacher

25:26.389 --> 25:28.260
It's like you don't watch the news at all

25:30.600 --> 25:32.330
it's just a trip

25:32.699 --> 25:35.330
When I'm there,
it's home to me

25:37.169 --> 25:40.939
Jobs are rarely safe jobs

25:42.510 --> 25:45.850
People who shouldn't be there are just
like me

25:48.379 --> 25:50.649
This means this could be a very dangerous situation

25:51.619 --> 25:53.250
Especially that side

25:55.490 --> 25:58.060
Hey Mr. Yin

25:58.590 --> 25:59.659
How are you?

25:59.990 --> 26:02.459
I apologize for being late

26:27.750 --> 26:28.790
Mother

26:34.290 --> 26:35.428
Is it because I have a car?

26:35.429 --> 26:36.658
A person who really shouldn't be there

26:36.659 --> 26:38.000
No one doesn't know

26:44.969 --> 26:47.439
thank you george

26:54.310 --> 26:56.879
- let's go
- let's talk

27:04.719 --> 27:07.688
Forget it

27:07.689 --> 27:10.358
start speaking

27:10.359 --> 27:13.329
Just do boring things

27:13.330 --> 27:15.968
speak your mind

27:15.969 --> 27:18.739
Physical anxiety,
tension, uncertainty

27:18.740 --> 27:22.580
I blushed and hesitated

27:27.750 --> 27:28.879
- miss
- arrive

27:29.520 --> 27:31.780
- Ha
- Split head?

27:33.619 --> 27:34.719
It doesn't matter

27:37.859 --> 27:38.919
No

27:39.490 --> 27:41.790
I don't want to chop three heads in one night

27:42.260 --> 27:43.359
Always be careful

27:44.399 --> 27:46.199
keep away

27:47.030 --> 27:49.469
let us stay away

27:53.169 --> 27:54.209
what is

28:06.919 --> 28:09.520
How are you?
I've been walking a little strange lately

28:12.689 --> 28:13.990
very convenient

28:14.290 --> 28:15.760
This is not something insurance can solve

28:16.899 --> 28:17.929
And that side

28:18.959 --> 28:20.329
It must be very convenient

28:20.330 --> 28:22.469
If you die here, things get a little complicated

28:25.070 --> 28:27.770
The death of someone who was never born?

28:38.179 --> 28:39.820
No way to take responsibility

28:42.490 --> 28:44.520
The answer is this sweet and salty bread

28:48.689 --> 28:50.429
the worst

28:52.129 --> 28:53.169
Mother

29:13.649 --> 29:14.719
enter first

29:28.030 --> 29:29.070
drink it

29:36.080 --> 29:38.209
You can even stay here forever

29:40.179 --> 29:41.350
Are you cursing?

29:44.949 --> 29:47.219
I don't even have a house, so
I can only sleep here

29:50.090 --> 29:51.889
The car will be repaired anyway

29:52.189 --> 29:53.530
Until then, stay here

29:54.830 --> 29:57.629
It's better to go out as little as possible, because it's very dangerous

29:58.560 --> 30:00.869
Why is it so dangerous?

30:02.939 --> 30:04.500
Don’t you feel like being in the club now?

30:05.500 --> 30:06.639
Have you registered?

30:07.340 --> 30:09.540
Do you have a job?

30:11.179 --> 30:12.439
Of course you can be a spy

30:13.909 --> 30:14.980
I will be careful

30:17.320 --> 30:20.820
On top of that, the subjects themselves
can become dangerous

30:22.320 --> 30:24.289
Even if I accidentally drop a nut here

30:24.290 --> 30:26.060
Because in thirty years it will become a tree

30:26.730 --> 30:30.159
A small act
can change someone's entire future

30:33.600 --> 30:34.669
I will remember

30:34.929 --> 30:36.569
- Hi
, Mom

30:36.570 --> 30:39.240
-Why are you so strong
? -Let me go, Mom.

30:39.810 --> 30:42.839
Which club does this girl go to?

30:42.840 --> 30:46.579
Do you want to follow in your sister's footsteps and
make me suffer?

30:46.580 --> 30:48.349
- No, Mom.
- I'm bored.

30:48.350 --> 30:51.520
Don't need everything, just go out

30:52.020 --> 30:53.149
Mom really

30:54.389 --> 30:56.289
As for women, it’s fine if they are fat like this.

30:56.290 --> 30:57.918
Did the Night King banish the child?

30:57.919 --> 31:00.560
If you are not satisfied, go down

31:01.689 --> 31:03.300
- Mom
- What?

31:03.899 --> 31:05.428
- mother
- this woman

31:05.429 --> 31:07.929
Mom is wrong

31:10.169 --> 31:12.040
Soon we will be punished

31:16.179 --> 31:17.209
Well

31:30.520 --> 31:32.520
It seems that the teacher is coming back

31:42.270 --> 31:44.399
If you call the TA

31:45.340 --> 31:47.240
It's like going to school around here

31:51.609 --> 31:53.609
So the house will be in this village

31:57.550 --> 31:59.590
Is this why I came to Wu Zongri?

32:02.020 --> 32:03.419
Because that's my mother's hometown

32:10.000 --> 32:11.959
Is this why you sent me here?

32:45.159 --> 32:46.869
Is it really comfortable to sleep here?

32:48.369 --> 32:49.469
this place is very comfortable

32:50.939 --> 32:53.139
If you need anything during your stay,
please let me know

32:53.369 --> 32:55.869
Clothes, rice, wine,
etc.

32:57.980 --> 33:01.179
The life I have dreamed of for a long time,
the feeling of being unemployed but rich

33:03.480 --> 33:06.689
Have fun while you still can,
it won't be too long

33:07.520 --> 33:10.359
I'm more device savvy than I thought

33:13.760 --> 33:14.790
Of course convenient

33:18.830 --> 33:20.699
thank you for everything you did today

33:23.240 --> 33:24.800
I think I'm going to be very nervous today

33:25.139 --> 33:26.770
Listen fully and don’t worry too much

33:27.969 --> 33:30.409
Because you can go home immediately

33:47.459 --> 33:48.629
Going crazy

33:49.699 --> 33:51.060
I don't know any more

33:55.429 --> 33:56.600
ha

34:24.460 --> 34:26.469
(First murder)

34:32.239 --> 34:35.139
In any case, it must be sent back before

34:43.219 --> 34:44.449

34:47.650 --> 34:48.850
Mr. Yin

34:50.360 --> 34:51.690
Mr. Yin A

34:53.960 --> 34:54.988
Yes

34:54.989 --> 34:58.229
Shun'e's father, what's going on since Sunday morning at seven o'clock?

34:58.230 --> 34:59.230
forehead..

34:59.231 --> 35:00.270
- Are you OK?
- Mother

35:00.600 --> 35:03.639
- Oh, I'm fine, thank you
- Oh

35:05.569 --> 35:06.739
Then let's go together

35:07.069 --> 35:08.069
Where?

35:08.239 --> 35:10.138
Ekanta De Li Hoi Man

35:10.139 --> 35:12.678
Wu Zhengli Family Walking Marathon
is a must

35:12.679 --> 35:14.549
The name is already printed on the T-shirt

35:14.650 --> 35:17.420
I don't have a family, I
'm busy, that's all

35:18.719 --> 35:20.488
There is another person like this

35:20.489 --> 35:21.618
This is when you need a partner

35:21.619 --> 35:22.718
-Let's go
-Rev

35:22.719 --> 35:24.419
- No, I'm...
- It's okay

35:24.420 --> 35:26.759
The teacher will be very happy if you go and take a look

35:30.730 --> 35:33.369
Yes, the timing is perfect

35:39.299 --> 35:41.639
So how do you find your mother’s home?

35:45.080 --> 35:46.139
Mother

35:50.480 --> 35:51.580
Mother

35:52.449 --> 35:53.589
super glue

35:58.489 --> 36:00.589
If not, is this
our mother's home?

36:07.469 --> 36:09.230
wow that's amazing

36:09.500 --> 36:11.900
marvelous

36:22.610 --> 36:24.619
Why do you still come?

36:26.750 --> 36:27.819
this time

36:29.319 --> 36:30.319
I like

36:32.589 --> 36:33.730
mystery

36:35.060 --> 36:36.259
remember

36:54.850 --> 36:57.850
Is my mother dead?

37:00.819 --> 37:02.350
In the toilet yesterday

37:05.190 --> 37:07.489
Is this why you came home?

37:19.909 --> 37:21.210
This is Li Sun

37:24.509 --> 37:25.509
my name

37:28.480 --> 37:30.150
Does it look like me?

37:30.580 --> 37:32.750
I don’t know if it’s because of the super glue.

37:33.319 --> 37:35.290
don't call me mom

37:37.960 --> 37:39.219
really scared

37:40.989 --> 37:42.759
Can I come with you?

38:34.380 --> 38:36.080
Do you work here every Sunday?

38:38.920 --> 38:39.920
It is not

38:40.889 --> 38:43.618
My mother and father used to take turns
working here

38:43.619 --> 38:46.989
We all
ran a marathon today, so I ran

38:48.029 --> 38:49.130
nine like this

38:55.400 --> 38:57.100
Are you going to continue sitting there?

38:58.400 --> 39:00.139
now i have to work

39:00.839 --> 39:03.178
I know, don't bother me anymore

39:03.179 --> 39:04.909
I will look at the scenery around me

40:35.969 --> 40:37.139
Mom, what's going on?

40:37.400 --> 40:40.408
Is this the hospital your father took you to?

40:40.409 --> 40:42.610
I was surprised to see you when I passed by

40:43.279 --> 40:44.409
Are you too busy?

40:44.779 --> 40:46.778
- Haha-
Only half a face

40:46.779 --> 40:48.449
- Makeup will ruin
- Okay.

40:51.980 --> 40:53.420
Will the author come?

40:53.719 --> 40:56.319
Were you late for the hospital?

40:57.360 --> 41:01.489
I also
wanted to be a novelist

41:02.029 --> 41:03.159
Is that easy?

41:04.199 --> 41:05.630
What kind of content?

41:06.159 --> 41:08.699
Can you give my mother a signed book?

41:09.869 --> 41:11.199
Does mom want to study?

41:11.969 --> 41:14.940
This is a book you haven't read yet

41:15.540 --> 41:16.710
Let's go quickly

41:17.909 --> 41:19.009
Yes

41:19.540 --> 41:23.049
Now that your eyesight is bad,
what books are you going to read?

41:24.880 --> 41:26.790
- I'm going, daughter.
- Yes.

41:26.889 --> 41:29.420
- Take care of the rice
- Okay

41:49.139 --> 41:52.309
If you break up, you will be alone

41:52.310 --> 41:55.008
tears and sadness

41:55.009 --> 41:57.948
If you leave you will regret it

41:57.949 --> 42:00.989
Why don't you say it?

42:02.190 --> 42:03.719
ha

42:04.190 --> 42:06.158
It would be great if I could find a member

The band could easily have been jailed

42:36.150 --> 42:38.589
- Is everyone feeling down?
- Yeah, everyone's down.

42:39.159 --> 42:40.159
ha

42:43.529 --> 42:46.159
What if I can't catch the bus on time?

42:51.239 --> 42:53.710
My mother also likes this book very much

42:59.380 --> 43:00.548
if it weren't for us

43:00.549 --> 43:02.110
I will read books at will

43:10.659 --> 43:11.759
This is..

43:13.060 --> 43:14.159
it's no coincidence

43:14.330 --> 43:17.299
How do you find a 19-year-old mother in a toy store ?

43:17.929 --> 43:20.429
There must be a reason

43:21.170 --> 43:24.900
I really want
to go back in time, Dad

43:25.799 --> 43:27.710
if we could go back to the past

43:29.810 --> 43:31.408
return to the past

43:31.409 --> 43:34.250
Then my mom told my dad...I...

43:36.250 --> 43:38.020
will make you not love

43:38.980 --> 43:40.520
happy mom alone

43:41.619 --> 43:43.319
I'll make it last a long time

43:45.319 --> 43:46.759
Will continue to stay

43:49.389 --> 43:52.028
My mother got married in 1988

43:52.029 --> 43:54.670
Because I said the first time we met was a year ago

44:02.469 --> 44:05.440
How could you really miss the bus?

44:52.759 --> 44:54.429
What time is the ride?

44:58.960 --> 45:00.000
How are you?

45:02.929 --> 45:03.969
Hospital..

45:05.500 --> 45:06.770
I think I have to go

45:13.980 --> 45:15.008
Mother

45:15.009 --> 45:17.149
(Wuzhuang Grocery Store)

45:17.150 --> 45:18.420
What happened to Sun Al?

45:18.719 --> 45:22.389
Suddenly he saw me
once

45:22.589 --> 45:24.790
suddenly this place

45:25.619 --> 45:27.589
Jump and jump

45:27.690 --> 45:30.730

45:31.799 --> 45:33.330
like to play

45:42.369 --> 45:44.409
- Mom
- Oh, oh

45:48.810 --> 45:50.880
- What's Ekanta's name
- Huh?

45:53.279 --> 45:54.989
its name is basisu

45:58.060 --> 45:59.520
name over there

46:03.029 --> 46:04.199
oh

46:08.670 --> 46:11.170
This is the first head

46:14.610 --> 46:16.210
How is this going?

46:20.449 --> 46:21.850
come and meet me

46:23.480 --> 46:25.179
Come in quickly

46:25.650 --> 46:26.920
- Ah
- come here

46:27.719 --> 46:29.089
Shun Alcock

46:30.049 --> 46:31.060
Come

46:31.119 --> 46:32.259
Quick entry

46:35.230 --> 46:36.789
- Very strong
- Come on

46:36.790 --> 46:38.000
- What
- Come on

46:40.600 --> 46:42.699
- How about it?
- bring it on

46:44.569 --> 46:46.569
They both look very similar

46:49.940 --> 46:51.440
Both are weird

47:18.069 --> 47:20.310
How is your head?

47:22.139 --> 47:25.009
I think it's okay

47:25.509 --> 47:26.810
absolutely awesome

47:29.580 --> 47:30.650
Indeed

47:35.219 --> 47:36.549
How are your legs?

47:38.520 --> 47:40.330
- run
- must run

47:57.040 --> 47:58.279
nothing strange

48:03.049 --> 48:04.579
Since when did you start using dialect?

48:04.580 --> 48:06.548
Used since birth

48:06.549 --> 48:09.489
All the weird stuff, I just asked
what happened

48:14.259 --> 48:15.330
you..

48:16.389 --> 48:18.659
Come on,
don't show up in front of us

48:20.730 --> 48:21.770
bread?

48:24.799 --> 48:28.310
Mom, I'm still working hard today,
little draftsman

48:30.610 --> 48:32.779
good friend

48:33.540 --> 48:34.879
I came out and had to go

48:34.880 --> 48:37.009
If I leave now, my mother will get fat

48:37.319 --> 48:38.650
a while

48:38.980 --> 48:41.019
We will have a lot of fun at school tomorrow

48:41.020 --> 48:42.420
Let's plan it together

48:43.719 --> 48:44.790
program

48:44.960 --> 48:46.360
Why did I do that?

48:47.190 --> 48:48.959
Why are you
talking like that?

48:48.960 --> 48:50.029
I..

48:53.330 --> 48:55.069
What happened to Solar Alpha?

48:56.299 --> 48:58.139
How great

49:00.270 --> 49:01.409
why is that?

49:02.440 --> 49:06.239
Do you know what the closest friend in the world
means?

49:06.940 --> 49:08.750
I have this kind of relationship with my son A

49:12.719 --> 49:14.548
yesterday I

49:14.549 --> 49:16.389
Sorry I hit my head

49:17.589 --> 49:18.659
very good

49:20.190 --> 49:21.560
as long as i'm here

49:22.060 --> 49:24.960
Because it has nothing to do with us

49:27.170 --> 49:28.630
Kill it before things get worse

49:28.830 --> 49:31.000
Why do you dislike me so much?

49:44.279 --> 49:45.350
Why?

49:52.960 --> 49:54.460
I am you

49:56.860 --> 49:58.630
What kind of person are you?

50:00.770 --> 50:03.299
Your love is so light and
insignificant

50:06.670 --> 50:08.239
Because everyone comes to see

50:10.310 --> 50:11.339
what is that..

50:12.779 --> 50:13.909

I'm really happy to be taking part in this year's competition

52:31.750 --> 52:34.549
I had to applaud three or two times from the sidelines

52:35.190 --> 52:36.250

52:37.119 --> 52:39.460
I heard that this year’s third prize is a Walkman

52:40.259 --> 52:42.389
i think we can do it

52:44.060 --> 52:46.400
A person who has nothing but money will
be trapped

Family means having a son

52:49.929 --> 52:51.699
Now he is sent to study in the United States

52:51.969 --> 52:55.940
Mom, the only happiness is waiting for him to come back

52:56.940 --> 52:58.909
When did you love me so much?

52:59.339 --> 53:02.710
Hey, Mr. Yoon, what have you been talking about since then?

53:05.449 --> 53:07.889
If you want to get the third prize, you have to speed up

53:08.989 --> 53:10.619

you won't be able to stand it for a whole day.

this is too much

So don't you want to do that?

55:26.190 --> 55:28.730
If you want to just disappear,
you can do it

55:29.290 --> 55:32.960
I can't lie and say I got it without it being stolen.

58:48.630 --> 58:50.429
Why did my friend fall into the water?

58:52.159 --> 58:53.699
Do they just stand there and watch?

i sit alone

59:37.440 --> 59:38.679
Why here?

59:39.509 --> 59:43.408
The first novel published in 1987 was
"Little Door".

59:43.409 --> 59:45.179
This wonderful book...

59:46.150 --> 59:48.888
Written by the teacher when he was 19 years old

59:48.889 --> 59:50.318
among teachers

59:50.319 --> 59:53.319
Don’t you know how many people were turned to glass because of the first novel?

59:54.489 --> 59:56.790
I'm the first piece of glass, aren't I?

59:58.259 --> 59:59.330
correct?

There is a big hospital at the crossroads of the village

My mother is a doctor there

01:01:01.790 --> 01:01:04.329
If things get worse,
take him with you.

01:01:04.330 --> 01:01:05.659
I will tell you for sure

See you at school tomorrow

01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:37.429
Sorry, sister,
I can't swim

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:38.830
because i am like this

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.480
Are those girls from the same school as you?

01:01:52.639 --> 01:01:53.679

01:01:54.509 --> 01:01:57.279
Yes, my
classmate

01:01:57.449 --> 01:02:00.449
What kind of friend would you watch yourself falling into the water and not help yourself?

01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:10.830
you can tell me the truth

01:02:13.929 --> 01:02:15.330
Do they bully you?

01:02:15.369 --> 01:02:16.429
It is not

01:02:17.230 --> 01:02:18.739

01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:21.210

01:02:23.239 --> 01:02:25.179
How could this be
a joke?

01:02:27.779 --> 01:02:29.810
Give me your opinion as if you've never seen this before

01:02:31.850 --> 01:02:34.919
But I can speak in school

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:36.219
they are the only ones

01:02:38.389 --> 01:02:41.730
Everyone doesn't like me very much

01:02:45.130 --> 01:02:48.069
That's why they don't want to talk to me

01:02:48.969 --> 01:02:50.230
that's why

01:02:51.369 --> 01:02:53.940
I have to stay friends with them

01:02:55.569 --> 01:02:57.810
This all must be a joke

01:02:59.779 --> 01:03:00.779
that's why

01:03:03.310 --> 01:03:04.750
that's why i want to talk about

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:13.889
I want to die

01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:35.009
Hey, Lee Seung Yi

01:03:36.679 --> 01:03:39.420
What are you doing there
? Did you come in early?

01:03:41.850 --> 01:03:44.319
Today's matter must be kept secret

01:03:47.119 --> 01:03:48.428
Come on in quickly!

01:03:48.429 --> 01:03:50.230
(Commemorating the 1988 Seoul Olympics
)

01:05:04.670 --> 01:05:06.139
a feeling

01:05:08.969 --> 01:05:11.310
I thought it was already too late to know

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:15.679
Have you ever thought about it?

01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:22.719
If only I had known earlier

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.619
If only I had known a little bit ahead of time

01:05:28.830 --> 01:05:30.790
I don't know if everything will change

01:05:35.730 --> 01:05:37.100
but not here

01:05:39.799 --> 01:05:41.968
Is there nothing left here ?

01:05:41.969 --> 01:05:43.540
Because before everything happens

01:05:49.350 --> 01:05:50.449
Although it hurts

01:05:52.619 --> 01:05:54.989
I think I can't go back now

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:00.619
There's work to be done here

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:44.429
"A Stranger I Met"

01:06:44.799 --> 01:06:46.999
I have to go to school

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.408
If you take off your makeup, your current life

01:06:48.409 --> 01:06:49.738
Because it's a very elusive face

01:06:49.739 --> 01:06:51.778
Does this make sense now?

01:06:51.779 --> 01:06:53.479
Not as a teacher, but
as a student

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:55.380
Let's take a look at registration,
carefully this time

01:06:55.549 --> 01:06:57.349
Have specific information

01:06:57.350 --> 01:07:00.649
He is a senior student of Wuzheng Middle School

01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:01.849
How did it happen?

01:07:01.850 --> 01:07:02.850
are you happy?

01:07:02.851 --> 01:07:05.060
It's okay
, I'm giving the cat a bath

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:07.419
List of main suspects at the time

01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:08.588
Three in total

01:07:08.589 --> 01:07:09.729
as close as possible

01:07:09.730 --> 01:07:11.658
I will join them and watch

01:07:11.659 --> 01:07:13.960
School..that's where it all started

01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:29.580
"A Stranger I Met"
