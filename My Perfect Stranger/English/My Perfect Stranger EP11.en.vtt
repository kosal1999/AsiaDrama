00:50.620 --> 00:53.319
Isn’t your brother asking for it?

00:53.389 --> 00:54.990
Just hand it over as soon as possible and it will be over

00:55.219 --> 00:57.590
There's so much nonsense, you stinky girl

00:58.959 --> 01:00.160
My brother

01:00.560 --> 01:03.630
Do you think I would be happy about being locked up?

01:03.800 --> 01:05.200
Or is it the opposite?

01:05.270 --> 01:08.140
Are you happy that Go Min-soo turned out like that?

01:08.399 --> 01:09.369
Just testing it out

01:09.440 --> 01:11.610
Where should I stimulate you to react?

01:11.709 --> 01:13.169
See what your weaknesses are

01:13.309 --> 01:15.640
Is there any secret weapon we can use?

01:15.780 --> 01:17.380
Before fully grasping this information

01:17.440 --> 01:18.979
She will never attack

01:20.750 --> 01:22.550
It hurts so much. My hand is broken.

01:23.179 --> 01:24.350
once she gets the hang of it

01:30.020 --> 01:31.059
you're done

01:31.330 --> 01:33.360
Go Min-soo is also a suspect, right?

01:33.690 --> 01:36.429
He served more than 30 years in prison as the real murderer

01:36.530 --> 01:38.669
But the most important thing is the witnesses

01:39.030 --> 01:40.770
She said she saw him kill someone with her own eyes

01:41.500 --> 01:43.470
His sister Gao Meishu said

01:53.780 --> 01:55.149
Do you find it interesting?

01:56.619 --> 01:57.819
We will come again next time

01:59.619 --> 02:02.490
What should I do if my popcorn is so bad?

02:02.559 --> 02:03.890
-Teacher- Is popcorn important now?

02:03.959 --> 02:04.729
How are you

02:04.789 --> 02:05.660
As long as I think of your fragile body

02:05.729 --> 02:06.459
fine

02:07.059 --> 02:08.160
are you injured

02:09.160 --> 02:10.130
How unreasonable

02:10.199 --> 02:11.229
I said

02:16.299 --> 02:17.639
Who are you staring at?

02:18.039 --> 02:19.009
What did you say

02:19.069 --> 02:21.109
Since you hit someone, you have to apologize first

02:21.180 --> 02:24.310
Why are you glaring at someone who is just waiting for peace and suffering?

02:24.710 --> 02:25.910
Didn't you see that he was wet?

02:26.009 --> 02:27.620
Who told him to stand in the middle of the road and block it?

02:27.850 --> 02:29.919
Even a grown man doesn’t know how to be polite to girls

02:29.979 --> 02:32.049
Do you know him? Why do you call him that?

02:32.350 --> 02:33.850
Apologize to him quickly, you bastard

02:33.949 --> 02:36.359
Why does this stinky girl have such a loud voice?

02:36.460 --> 02:37.630
Why are you meddling in other people's business?

02:37.690 --> 02:39.359
Why are you so careful that I'll beat you up?

02:39.430 --> 02:40.489
elder brother

02:42.000 --> 02:44.400
What's going on? Are you Yanyu?

02:45.329 --> 02:46.400
Brat

02:47.739 --> 02:50.000
When did you come back from the United States?

02:50.639 --> 02:52.009
Shang Shu, please say hello to him quickly.

02:52.169 --> 02:53.370
The building in our house is in his father's name

02:53.440 --> 02:56.079
Brother, please apologize first.

02:56.509 --> 02:57.539
What

02:58.079 --> 02:58.780
Did you just yell at her?

02:58.850 --> 02:59.609
Do you call her a stinky girl?

03:01.220 --> 03:02.350
she is my girlfriend

03:02.850 --> 03:03.880
What

03:07.889 --> 03:08.889
I see

03:09.319 --> 03:11.259
This elder brother is also familiar with me

03:11.590 --> 03:13.859
But why are his clothes so wet?

03:16.729 --> 03:17.769
Excuse me

03:19.400 --> 03:20.400
fine

03:21.970 --> 03:24.470
Sorry I'm sorry

03:24.710 --> 03:27.609
Teacher, I'll take my leave first.

03:28.210 --> 03:29.310
Good to know

03:29.910 --> 03:31.079
yes

03:31.579 --> 03:33.310
- How are you doing? - Of course.

03:35.079 --> 03:36.180
How are you doing?

03:36.979 --> 03:38.889
Nothing special

03:40.190 --> 03:42.759
She left the village immediately the night she gave birth to you.

03:44.289 --> 03:46.530
Even if I see you crying and your face is red

03:46.590 --> 03:47.359
she also

03:48.329 --> 03:50.060
I never hugged you once and then turned around and left

03:51.799 --> 03:53.900
She sees you as a stain in her life

03:55.039 --> 03:56.739
So don't be curious anymore

03:56.799 --> 03:57.810
Don't even think about her

04:16.319 --> 04:17.560
really strange

04:19.190 --> 04:21.660
He was obviously just standing there looking at me

04:24.830 --> 04:26.229
At first I wanted to say what he was doing

04:27.429 --> 04:29.499
But suddenly I felt sad

04:31.369 --> 04:34.439
My heart became inexplicably dull

04:35.780 --> 04:36.879
The whole person is depressed

04:38.780 --> 04:40.379
Are you obsessed with him?

04:42.950 --> 04:44.179
I was serious

04:47.020 --> 04:50.220
Maybe there's something really different about him

04:52.030 --> 04:52.929
first time i saw him

04:52.989 --> 04:54.129
I also feel that the mood is a bit subtle

04:55.700 --> 04:57.869
Should I say it was like this before?

04:59.200 --> 05:00.629
My dad said he wanted to introduce someone to me

05:00.700 --> 05:01.840
He even told me his name

05:03.070 --> 05:04.070
That man's name is Haejun

05:05.970 --> 05:08.939
Is his name Haejun?

05:09.780 --> 05:10.780
do you remember

05:11.109 --> 05:14.309
The letter you wrote to me when I was in America

05:16.220 --> 05:18.419
If we get married and have children in the future

05:18.489 --> 05:19.749
I’ll name him Haejun

05:21.289 --> 05:22.820
I don’t know if it’s because of this

05:24.890 --> 05:26.160
I have special feelings for him

05:27.900 --> 05:28.830
but

05:29.559 --> 05:30.429
Very strange

05:46.979 --> 05:50.249
No wonder I didn't like her from the beginning

06:18.879 --> 06:19.979
Did you eat

06:22.379 --> 06:23.479
Do you know me

06:24.080 --> 06:25.249
Can't we just start getting to know each other now?

06:25.650 --> 06:27.090
Since it's your first time here, I'll give you a cup of tea.

06:27.489 --> 06:28.590
That's what I'm best at

06:39.629 --> 06:41.200
Oh my God, are you crazy?

06:41.270 --> 06:42.299
Why break the egg?

06:42.369 --> 06:43.570
Don’t you know how to drink Shuanghe tea?

06:44.299 --> 06:45.970
You don't care how I want to drink it

06:46.039 --> 06:47.369
Wait for me and I'll make you another cup

06:47.809 --> 06:50.039
No, it's okay

06:52.150 --> 06:55.650
I can't stand someone cracking the egg

06:56.650 --> 06:58.520
This is how you want to drink

06:58.590 --> 06:59.789
- Good mouth open - No need

06:59.850 --> 07:00.989
I will do it myself

07:01.049 --> 07:03.059
It doesn't matter, I'll take it all, just relax

07:03.119 --> 07:04.460
Because I feel very uncomfortable

07:04.520 --> 07:05.629
Oh my god

07:10.900 --> 07:12.700
There

07:23.179 --> 07:25.749
I think in the future

07:26.450 --> 07:28.720
I should come here often

07:28.919 --> 07:29.950
Really

07:34.090 --> 07:35.119
so

07:36.419 --> 07:37.820
I hope you can talk to me without any problem

07:37.890 --> 07:40.689
Physical contact or interference in my affairs

07:41.600 --> 07:43.059
You don’t need to recommend meals to me.

07:43.359 --> 07:45.369
Treat me as a stranger as much as possible and ignore me

07:47.229 --> 07:48.939
Even though we didn’t know each other before

07:50.100 --> 07:51.570
I know I will work hard

07:54.570 --> 07:55.580
good

07:57.140 --> 07:58.150
I can't stand it

08:05.619 --> 08:07.249
Look how she does whatever she wants

08:09.289 --> 08:10.760
No wonder they leave their children alone

08:17.059 --> 08:18.369
It's a stranger anyway

08:19.700 --> 08:20.999
we are just strangers

08:32.249 --> 08:34.080
after that night

08:34.749 --> 08:36.619
time flies

08:38.050 --> 08:39.850
But the amazing thing is

08:39.950 --> 08:42.190
The village remains unchanged

08:48.700 --> 08:50.759
How on earth do you do things?

08:51.899 --> 08:53.629
It’s been half a month, let alone catching the culprit.

08:54.029 --> 08:56.070
Not even a single suspect has been identified.

08:57.340 --> 08:58.540
Do you think it makes sense?

09:00.040 --> 09:01.040
talk

09:02.639 --> 09:03.540
“Incompetent and irresponsible”

09:03.609 --> 09:04.810
"Chief of Ushii Police Station"

09:04.879 --> 09:05.879
hateful

09:06.979 --> 09:09.450
"Before promotion review of Gyeonggi Province Police Chief"

09:09.519 --> 09:10.749
"Doubted as to whether he is not qualified"

09:11.790 --> 09:12.820
Hey Hyun Kyu

09:13.389 --> 09:14.889
are you

09:15.259 --> 09:17.960
Deliberately trying to block my future

09:20.259 --> 09:21.359
I'm very sorry

09:22.930 --> 09:26.229
My future is your future

09:27.800 --> 09:29.269
Wake me up

09:29.869 --> 09:31.139
Show me the results

09:31.810 --> 09:33.769
Gotta catch a guy within a week

09:34.879 --> 09:36.040
bring it to me

09:39.180 --> 09:40.810
Don't do something stupid

09:43.479 --> 09:45.649
Why are you still standing there? Hurry up and get out.

09:46.519 --> 09:47.720
Go investigate

10:25.930 --> 10:27.460
where did you just go

10:27.590 --> 10:29.330
Why didn't you wake me up and come with you?

10:30.330 --> 10:31.470
Are you having nightmares again?

10:33.700 --> 10:34.600
What the hell is this dream?

10:34.670 --> 10:36.899
How come I have the same dream for a week in a row?

10:40.710 --> 10:42.210
Are you really not going to tell me?

10:47.749 --> 10:49.180
Then where were you just now?

10:53.050 --> 10:54.090
Today is

10:54.889 --> 10:56.320
The day Baek Yoo-seob was discharged from the hospital

10:56.820 --> 10:58.290
I just happened to have something to ask him.

10:58.359 --> 10:59.290
Just drop by

11:02.729 --> 11:04.970
Uncle should also know by now

11:05.899 --> 11:07.930
Who died in this village?

11:41.430 --> 11:44.369
I know you have nothing to do with the murder.

11:44.940 --> 11:47.009
But with the two victims

11:47.070 --> 11:49.080
People with whom you have the most frequent contact

11:50.080 --> 11:51.879
It’s not Baek Hee-seop, it’s you

11:52.909 --> 11:54.810
Is there anything you can share with me?

12:02.460 --> 12:05.989
The reason why Li Zhuying returned to the village

12:06.529 --> 12:07.889
It’s because of Baek Yoo Seop

12:08.759 --> 12:10.129
They originally agreed to leave together

12:10.830 --> 12:12.869
She will come here in the first place

12:13.029 --> 12:14.269
It was also because of Baek Yoo Seob’s help.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.399
I think

12:17.470 --> 12:19.670
They may not just be a simple relationship between seniors and juniors

12:21.409 --> 12:22.979
Then why didn't he leave?

12:23.440 --> 12:24.779
Because a few days later

12:25.379 --> 12:27.509
It happens to be the death anniversary of Baek Yoo-seop’s parents

12:29.080 --> 12:31.080
If you want to avoid police eyes and ears, leave

12:31.320 --> 12:33.889
I don’t know when I can come back again

12:33.950 --> 12:37.159
At least he wanted to spend more time with his brother that day

12:37.720 --> 12:40.960
So I decided to hide in the village for those few days.

12:43.159 --> 12:45.529
But where they are hiding

12:46.470 --> 12:47.529
It happens to be an abandoned house

12:49.440 --> 12:51.300
- Could it be - That's right

12:52.210 --> 12:55.379
It was the abandoned house where Li Jingai was found.

12:58.040 --> 13:01.450
The night of the incident

13:02.080 --> 13:04.249
She seems to have gone to find us too

13:04.989 --> 13:06.019
How are you

13:10.519 --> 13:11.989
That day when we were with Li Jingai

13:12.330 --> 13:14.529
She seems to be secretly following Baek Yoo Seob

13:34.109 --> 13:35.249
What to wear?

13:37.550 --> 13:39.889
Anyway, the three of them became friends

13:40.790 --> 13:42.060
And Li Jingai also helped keep it secret

13:42.119 --> 13:43.290
I'm also curious

13:44.790 --> 13:46.259
After she listened to our story

13:47.460 --> 13:49.200
Expressing that he wants to help with something

13:50.529 --> 13:52.229
She asked if we needed anything

13:53.869 --> 13:54.899
she may be

13:56.070 --> 13:58.269
You go there just to get something for us.

13:59.739 --> 14:02.040
If I hadn't gone to Seoul then

14:02.810 --> 14:04.609
If we hadn't missed it

14:07.350 --> 14:09.920
can protect the two of them

14:18.330 --> 14:21.229
What puzzles me most during this period is

14:24.430 --> 14:26.029
That's the sentence

14:27.330 --> 14:29.499
"Women who read are dangerous"

14:30.739 --> 14:32.440
What does this sentence mean?

14:33.239 --> 14:35.109
Why did the prisoner write this sentence specifically?

14:35.180 --> 14:37.109
stay with the victim

14:47.090 --> 14:48.989
Li Zhuying does have a book at hand

14:49.060 --> 14:50.159
But

14:50.889 --> 14:52.460
Only Lee Joo Young has it

15:01.869 --> 15:03.540
Li Jingai doesn’t have such a thing

15:04.769 --> 15:06.409
That's what I originally thought

15:07.470 --> 15:10.639
The reason why Li Jingai went to that abandoned house that night

15:11.680 --> 15:13.149
It’s to send Baek Yoo-seop away

15:13.479 --> 15:16.320
The only thing I need from Lee Joo Young

15:18.720 --> 15:19.920
what do you think that would be

15:23.019 --> 15:24.220
It turns out to be a book

15:33.930 --> 15:35.200
Thus

15:35.700 --> 15:38.710
The victims really have something in common

15:38.970 --> 15:40.269
That's the book in their hands

15:42.680 --> 15:44.739
Maybe this is a warning

15:46.080 --> 15:47.779
But where did those books go?

15:48.109 --> 15:49.550
Why didn't I see it at the crime scene?

15:50.749 --> 15:52.149
If the prisoner notices

15:52.220 --> 15:53.920
If you write this kind of sentence

15:54.989 --> 15:56.790
Then it's possible that they were taken away by prisoners.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.330
Although I don’t know the reason for doing this

16:18.210 --> 16:20.509
Brother that one

16:20.580 --> 16:23.220
I know very well the terms we negotiated

16:26.519 --> 16:29.889
I also know I can only get in and out of the garage but

16:32.290 --> 16:35.899
Why are you making such a disgusting gasping sound?

16:37.060 --> 16:41.330
I'm dying. I'm in a hurry to get a big size.

16:41.399 --> 16:44.139
- Wait for me. - No.

16:44.700 --> 16:47.139
Yunying quickly cleaned these up

17:02.420 --> 17:03.820
where is the toilet

17:44.060 --> 17:45.159
Occasionally this happens

17:45.629 --> 17:47.800
I forgot that his stomach is weak

17:49.399 --> 17:50.740
Just do this

17:51.469 --> 17:53.109
He spends almost all day in the garage

17:53.169 --> 17:54.369
If he is not even allowed to use the toilet

17:54.439 --> 17:56.540
This is too harsh on our heroes.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.649
But why is it a book?

18:05.179 --> 18:07.149
"Women who read are dangerous"

18:09.060 --> 18:12.359
Publishing books is my job

18:13.429 --> 18:16.730
Is this really all a coincidence?

18:19.570 --> 18:22.639
At the end of the day, my mom also wanted to be a writer who wrote books.

18:22.699 --> 18:24.000
And Gao Meishu is too

18:24.899 --> 18:26.310
i always think

18:27.540 --> 18:30.780
Maybe all this is not just a coincidence

19:10.520 --> 19:11.719
Then what are you going to do for me?

19:12.290 --> 19:13.389
What

19:13.889 --> 19:17.320
I've already paid for your tuition.

19:17.659 --> 19:19.359
So what are you going to do for me?

19:20.429 --> 19:23.100
Didn’t you also steal dad’s private money?

19:23.230 --> 19:25.530
Why is stolen money not money?

19:25.929 --> 19:27.969
Looks like it won’t work anymore. Give it back to me.

19:28.030 --> 19:29.600
Dad Lee Soon Ae

19:29.669 --> 19:30.840
What do you want me to do

19:35.580 --> 19:36.679
my name

19:38.010 --> 19:41.179
If you become a novelist in the future

19:41.510 --> 19:43.050
I hope you can be in the corner of the book

19:43.949 --> 19:46.119
write my name

19:46.290 --> 19:47.550
What's that?

19:47.619 --> 19:49.189
What kind of stinky girl could she be?

19:49.260 --> 19:50.859
this is amazing

19:50.919 --> 19:54.990
Feed one person at most

19:55.060 --> 19:56.859
Neither will live to be a hundred years old

19:58.199 --> 20:00.830
But books can last forever

20:01.429 --> 20:05.939
So if you are willing to write my name in the book

20:06.070 --> 20:07.939
Everyone will know this person Li Jingai

20:08.010 --> 20:10.709
once lived in this world

20:10.939 --> 20:12.810
This way it will be famous forever

20:12.879 --> 20:13.949
Is this so happy?

20:14.050 --> 20:15.250
Of course I'm happy

20:15.580 --> 20:19.119
Hey, even after a thousand years

20:19.189 --> 20:21.990
I can also be known to the world as Li Jingai

20:22.659 --> 20:25.830
Your sister will soon become a famous person

20:27.189 --> 20:28.290
Do you dare to laugh?

20:28.429 --> 20:30.300
Hello to the Chinese teacher from the opposite house

20:30.359 --> 20:32.070
He also praised me for feeling very good

20:32.300 --> 20:34.570
She also said that even if she is not Miss Korea,

20:34.629 --> 20:36.840
There is also a way to go on TV

20:38.639 --> 20:41.040
Soonae if I become very famous

20:41.570 --> 20:44.340
i will be all over the world

20:44.409 --> 20:46.949
I leave my footprints in every corner

20:47.679 --> 20:50.379
Dear villagers in Niujingli,

20:50.520 --> 20:53.990
The eldest daughter of Lee Hyung Man and Park Ok Ja

20:54.149 --> 20:55.859
Ms. Lee Kyung-ae

20:56.020 --> 21:00.060
She lived a life full of fun

21:02.500 --> 21:03.530
like this

21:03.830 --> 21:06.469
So you must remember to write

21:06.530 --> 21:07.230
Do you understand

21:10.070 --> 21:11.869
You don't answer me

21:12.169 --> 21:14.439
- Then I'll take this back. - No.

21:15.169 --> 21:16.679
Do you know how many bottles of wine these can buy?

22:14.730 --> 22:16.040
Did you see the bookstore on the way here?

22:16.100 --> 22:18.100
I saw that Go Mi-sook is actually a novelist

22:18.169 --> 22:19.770
It really scared me

22:20.010 --> 22:21.070
It's amazing

22:21.969 --> 22:24.209
Hey, I heard that Go Mi-sook became a novelist.

22:24.679 --> 22:26.250
Really

22:32.949 --> 22:34.020
"To Y"

22:34.189 --> 22:36.159
"Sometimes I feel lonely"

22:36.219 --> 22:37.590
"I can imagine"

22:37.659 --> 22:39.189
“That one is equally unpopular”

22:39.260 --> 22:42.260
"My secret little door hidden somewhere"

22:43.659 --> 22:44.699
I missed

22:46.369 --> 22:48.070
I really didn't expect it would be this time

22:51.340 --> 22:52.369
"Congratulations"

22:52.869 --> 22:54.869
"The birth of a genius female high school novelist"

22:55.369 --> 22:57.209
"New products this year, new products this year"

22:57.280 --> 22:58.310
"Changes in Publishing"

22:58.879 --> 23:00.649
"The birth of a 19-year-old female high school novelist"

23:00.810 --> 23:03.250
"Appeared like a comet in the literary world"

23:03.320 --> 23:04.449
“little wine”

23:07.850 --> 23:10.389
Is it written there about Gao Meishu from our school?

23:11.590 --> 23:14.230
Gao Meishu in our class is absolutely true

23:14.790 --> 23:17.330
A newspaper company wanted to interview her

23:17.500 --> 23:20.429
Asked if I could bring publishing house staff and reporters with me

23:20.929 --> 23:22.369
No problem, right?

23:23.669 --> 23:26.510
Do I need to fix my hair?

23:26.709 --> 23:29.139
Tell me why until I finish writing this book

23:29.209 --> 23:30.840
She had never mentioned this to the school before

23:30.909 --> 23:33.109
She really fooled everyone

23:33.280 --> 23:35.580
She suddenly brought the book over and shocked me.

24:03.909 --> 24:05.040
That's outrageous

24:09.350 --> 24:10.350
how come

24:31.070 --> 24:33.540
I want to help my mother realize her dream that she couldn't realize

24:34.439 --> 24:36.740
I heard she once dreamed of becoming a novelist

24:38.409 --> 24:39.550
just like me

24:40.310 --> 24:42.419
She was once a young person who was passionate about literature

24:43.280 --> 24:44.619
He is also my junior college student

24:45.850 --> 24:49.020
Oh my God, it turns out she inherited your talent.

24:49.090 --> 24:50.790
- That's true - That's a prize

24:51.060 --> 24:53.189
My daughter is better than me

24:55.030 --> 24:56.399
After all, this is my first work

24:56.959 --> 24:58.929
If you want to be on par with your mother, you still have a long way to go.

24:59.429 --> 25:01.469
But I hope this is a special gift

25:02.540 --> 25:04.169
Because it will be her birthday soon

25:05.369 --> 25:06.409
is that so

25:06.639 --> 25:08.070
Oh, happy birthday to you

25:08.139 --> 25:11.609
The relationship between mother and daughter is really harmonious.

25:12.709 --> 25:13.949
this will be the best gift

25:14.080 --> 25:16.480
First day on the shelves in bookstores in Seoul

25:16.550 --> 25:18.780
received a warm response

25:19.090 --> 25:22.149
There is even a trend of becoming a best-selling book

25:22.219 --> 25:24.859
- Really? - That's great.

25:26.530 --> 25:29.030
It is also a great joy for us at Ushii High School

25:29.199 --> 25:31.100
This is the first time since the establishment of the school

25:32.060 --> 25:33.730
if i knew in advance

25:33.800 --> 25:36.570
Will definitely hang a big banner in the school

25:48.780 --> 25:49.850
Takami tree

25:52.719 --> 25:53.790
talk to me

26:08.629 --> 26:09.800
how could you do such a thing

26:10.969 --> 26:13.469
tell me why

26:16.810 --> 26:17.980
How could you steal

26:18.709 --> 26:19.780
what did i steal

26:20.949 --> 26:21.879
what are you saying

26:21.949 --> 26:23.280
my novel

26:24.850 --> 26:27.490
Don't lie shamelessly in front of me

26:29.189 --> 26:30.419
what your novel

26:31.689 --> 26:33.659
I really don't know what you are talking about

26:41.730 --> 26:42.840
Mi-sook please

26:43.669 --> 26:44.939
Have you been having a hard time lately?

26:46.109 --> 26:48.169
Then you can't make trouble with Shun Ai unreasonably.

26:49.409 --> 26:51.409
How many times did you think you could help me with my composition assignments?

26:52.080 --> 26:54.949
Do you mistakenly think that what I wrote is yours?

27:03.359 --> 27:05.320
I didn't expect you to be so bad

27:07.590 --> 27:08.689
I won't tolerate it

27:10.600 --> 27:11.830
I want to make the truth known to the world

27:12.800 --> 27:14.300
What you asked me to do

27:15.600 --> 27:16.639
All will be told

27:35.790 --> 27:37.689
Why are you so annoying Soon Ae?

27:39.590 --> 27:41.359
Then I have to take measures

27:42.929 --> 27:44.030
What a trouble

27:46.330 --> 27:47.369
you

27:49.199 --> 27:50.399
Is there any evidence?

27:53.169 --> 27:54.310
Lost notebook?

27:56.510 --> 27:58.840
Does anyone know if you wrote that?

28:06.090 --> 28:08.020
No matter what, your efforts will be in vain

28:09.719 --> 28:11.619
So just wait and see.

28:15.429 --> 28:16.100
Keep making trouble

28:16.159 --> 28:17.929
Be careful to end up like your sister Shun Ai

28:19.869 --> 28:20.899
ok

28:53.330 --> 28:55.030
I once wanted a woman who likes to read books

28:56.439 --> 28:58.770
Why do they always look like that?

29:00.770 --> 29:01.770
What

29:02.169 --> 29:04.240
Act like you are the protagonist

29:04.939 --> 29:07.480
Pretend to be smart and know everything

29:08.480 --> 29:10.719
I just know how to read a few words on paper

29:11.780 --> 29:13.550
As if I am such a unique existence

29:13.619 --> 29:14.889
It’s really unpleasant to look at

29:17.159 --> 29:18.490
But after trying it I found

29:21.760 --> 29:22.859
Quite interesting

29:47.290 --> 29:48.689
It's not too late now

29:50.659 --> 29:52.959
There's still time to save it

29:56.629 --> 29:58.060
Gao Meishu is right

29:59.969 --> 30:03.199
I have no evidence, who will believe me?

30:04.770 --> 30:06.270
The notebook has disappeared without a trace

30:07.810 --> 30:09.340
The book has also been published

30:12.080 --> 30:13.810
The only person who sees me writing

30:15.480 --> 30:16.949
only my sister

30:21.389 --> 30:22.689
but she has

30:32.399 --> 30:33.969
Why do you give up without even trying?

30:35.800 --> 30:38.000
If Gao Mi-sook says no, will it be over?

30:38.600 --> 30:40.310
Because Go Mi-sook said otherwise

30:41.540 --> 30:43.139
Everyone will believe her

30:58.159 --> 31:00.429
If this matter gets too big

31:01.389 --> 31:03.760
My parents will know too

31:07.399 --> 31:08.699
But my parents

31:11.070 --> 31:14.969
Even if he knew I wrote novels, he wouldn't be proud of it

31:17.109 --> 31:19.879
Instead, it will only make them work harder.

31:24.449 --> 31:26.250
as long as i give up

31:31.320 --> 31:34.889
As long as I swallow my anger

31:37.959 --> 31:41.830
Maybe you can just pretend that nothing happened

31:45.600 --> 31:47.310
This is possible for everyone

31:49.139 --> 31:50.409
It will be better

31:52.540 --> 31:53.580
turn out to be

31:55.209 --> 31:57.980
Mom gave up in this mood

32:03.219 --> 32:04.389
But this won't work

32:07.590 --> 32:09.129
Cheer up Lee Soon Ae

32:10.060 --> 32:12.199
Is your family only composed of mom and dad?

32:13.699 --> 32:15.369
There are also Wufu and my sister.

32:16.540 --> 32:17.600
no

32:17.969 --> 32:19.840
Is it just Wufu and sister?

32:20.510 --> 32:22.010
Otherwise, who else

32:26.409 --> 32:28.649
Think about it as if you have other family members

32:29.419 --> 32:30.520
that person

32:31.219 --> 32:33.750
My favorite novel written by you in the world

32:35.689 --> 32:36.889
That person hopes to be in this world

32:36.959 --> 32:38.060
In favorite novel

32:39.320 --> 32:42.189
Write your name and not someone else's

32:43.530 --> 32:45.159
That person wants you to borrow that novel

32:46.300 --> 32:48.270
Become a truly handsome novelist

32:50.939 --> 32:52.840
You can also read your favorite books

32:54.209 --> 32:55.639
listen to music to your heart's content

32:57.280 --> 33:00.010
While sipping hot coffee

33:01.409 --> 33:03.949
I hope you don't have to give up anything anymore

33:06.050 --> 33:08.090
You can do what you want

33:11.520 --> 33:14.060
Maybe someone is so desperate to

33:16.330 --> 33:18.730
can you live like this

33:20.070 --> 33:21.129
do you know

33:34.310 --> 33:35.409
come on in

33:47.830 --> 33:49.699
- Behave yourself - Where are you going?

34:10.050 --> 34:11.080
Soon Ae

34:12.279 --> 34:14.150
You know in Moon Night nightclub

34:14.219 --> 34:17.219
Do you occasionally go to the Hallasan Band where you sing as a resident?

34:22.130 --> 34:23.960
Although some people say that they

34:24.029 --> 34:25.960
Is it imitating the Changbai Mountain Band?

34:26.500 --> 34:28.830
But I still respect those brothers very much

34:29.199 --> 34:30.600
Especially the drummer brother inside

34:31.540 --> 34:34.339
But one day that brother

34:34.569 --> 34:35.940
A big crisis has come

34:37.380 --> 34:38.540
what crisis

34:45.420 --> 34:46.489
Have loose bowels

34:47.850 --> 34:49.790
Should I endure it until death or go to the toilet alive?

34:50.719 --> 34:53.529
He must make a choice immediately

34:53.730 --> 34:57.199
At this time, the brother glanced around

34:57.429 --> 34:59.199
Just a small performance in a village nightclub

34:59.259 --> 35:01.299
There won't be any problem if you interrupt for a while.

35:01.900 --> 35:04.940
But that brother did it for the audience

35:05.339 --> 35:06.940
Hold his position until the end

35:08.369 --> 35:11.210
Does that mean he was pulled out where he was?

35:11.509 --> 35:12.540
yes

35:16.580 --> 35:19.279
What's the takeaway from this sordid story?

35:20.089 --> 35:21.920
Now that it has started

35:22.520 --> 35:23.989
The result should be made

35:35.929 --> 35:39.069
Isn’t that novel Shun Ai You?

35:41.110 --> 35:43.339
Then you should try your best to hold it until the end.

35:43.909 --> 35:46.710
I'm waving like crazy next to you to cheer you on

35:47.580 --> 35:50.380
How can you give up, right?

35:51.750 --> 35:53.889
How can you forget that I'm still here?

36:07.770 --> 36:08.830
You stinky girl

36:09.500 --> 36:10.069
Mother

36:10.139 --> 36:12.940
How could I not be proud of you?

36:13.569 --> 36:15.009
- What - you know?

36:15.069 --> 36:18.339
When your sister said she wanted to be Miss Korea

36:18.480 --> 36:19.980
When I said I wanted to be a singer

36:21.080 --> 36:23.380
I never promised her once

36:23.819 --> 36:25.520
Do you know how much I regret it?

36:34.589 --> 36:36.860
Stand tall and fight for your return, you know?

36:56.520 --> 36:57.549
Let's go

37:06.759 --> 37:07.889
what

37:09.860 --> 37:11.960
How many people did you let know about this?

37:12.560 --> 37:15.299
Bad things should be known to as many people as possible

37:17.369 --> 37:19.639
Only then will bad women be punished

37:24.880 --> 37:28.409
That's a road I'm very familiar with

37:30.279 --> 37:32.420
About 30 years in the future

37:32.480 --> 37:34.790
It's my way to work in a publishing house

37:36.150 --> 37:37.889
Although this is me

37:38.319 --> 37:39.889
It was the first time I went there with my mother.

37:53.810 --> 37:55.009
And there

37:56.210 --> 37:59.239
There are very familiar faces that I have known for a long time

38:01.779 --> 38:03.549
The real owner of the novel has arrived

38:04.850 --> 38:06.650
Do you want to have a formal talk?

38:09.860 --> 38:11.219
That's really not the case

38:11.489 --> 38:13.460
They colluded to do this.

38:14.759 --> 38:16.029
what on earth do you want

38:16.330 --> 38:17.900
This is no small matter

38:18.199 --> 38:20.000
This book has been published

38:20.069 --> 38:20.770
National Bookstore

38:20.830 --> 38:23.469
They're all being sold under my name and photo.

38:23.540 --> 38:25.500
If things get serious, can you take responsibility?

38:27.969 --> 38:29.239
And do you have evidence?

38:31.639 --> 38:34.179
Not to mention that your parents are still grieving the loss of their daughter.

38:35.750 --> 38:37.850
Is it really okay for you to make trouble like this?

38:40.589 --> 38:42.949
Senior, let’s wait until the lawyer comes to talk.

38:44.020 --> 38:46.159
Prisoners are always clamoring for evidence.

38:46.960 --> 38:48.989
Evidence from your mouth

38:49.060 --> 38:51.029
If it refers to the notebook that was stolen by you

38:51.100 --> 38:52.460
That doesn't

38:53.060 --> 38:55.069
But you thought writing a novel

38:55.799 --> 38:58.199
Is just a notebook enough?

39:14.190 --> 39:16.420
This is a novel I started writing two years ago

39:16.989 --> 39:20.159
There are articles in it that I wrote and then deleted.

39:20.230 --> 39:22.830
Thinking about what words to use and what meanings to give them

39:22.889 --> 39:24.429
What is written in the essay

39:24.529 --> 39:26.500
There are also chapters that I originally wanted to include but later deleted.

39:26.569 --> 39:27.900
it's all inside

39:28.869 --> 39:30.069
You'll understand once you see it

39:31.170 --> 39:33.610
Once you see it, you will know that you will definitely do it.

39:33.670 --> 39:34.909
Those were her notes after reading my novel

39:34.969 --> 39:36.409
fabricated by oneself

39:36.469 --> 39:38.480
I can answer all the questions

39:38.540 --> 39:40.480
All about the novel

39:41.610 --> 39:43.350
I can answer them all

39:45.779 --> 39:47.119
But you can't do it

39:48.290 --> 39:49.350
Takami tree

40:07.009 --> 40:09.839
Senior, what are you doing?

40:10.279 --> 40:11.710
She said she would know after seeing it

40:13.409 --> 40:14.710
Of course it depends

40:15.580 --> 40:16.949
and ask her

40:17.549 --> 40:19.350
I also have many curious things

40:23.360 --> 40:25.759
Mother

40:37.369 --> 40:38.069
yes

40:38.139 --> 40:41.310
The quantity published so far is planned to be recycled

40:41.739 --> 40:43.880
Interviews with writers have also been cancelled.

40:45.210 --> 40:48.480
Will not be republished anytime soon

40:50.219 --> 40:52.520
The content of the novel will not be changed

40:52.850 --> 40:55.589
Instead, change the author’s name and novel cover

40:56.119 --> 40:57.219
Yes

40:57.759 --> 41:00.360
Please arrange a time for the interview then.

41:01.929 --> 41:03.529
OK, thanks

41:06.670 --> 41:08.529
republished in mom's name

41:08.600 --> 41:09.730
The first page of the novel

41:10.540 --> 41:13.270
She specifically requested that this sentence be added.

41:15.170 --> 41:16.639
"This novel"

41:16.810 --> 41:19.980
"Dedicated to those who live in the cow well"

41:20.310 --> 41:22.279
"The eldest daughter of Lee Hyung Man and Park Ok Ja"

41:22.350 --> 41:23.210
"Li Jingai"

41:29.960 --> 41:33.529
At the same time, I also learned a little secret

41:45.400 --> 41:46.839
I have a question

41:49.170 --> 41:51.239
"To Y"

41:52.040 --> 41:53.279
Who is Y?

42:02.850 --> 42:03.889
yes

42:05.819 --> 42:08.130
The name of the friend I want to see in the future

42:16.969 --> 42:18.040
She said it was

42:19.040 --> 42:20.440
If she gives birth to a daughter in the future

42:20.509 --> 42:23.139
The first English letter of the name I want to give her

42:23.980 --> 42:26.909
For example, Yunying’s Y

42:33.790 --> 42:34.989
Yunying thank you

42:36.150 --> 42:39.159
Thanks to you I can get my novel back

42:40.529 --> 42:41.529
Me too

42:42.389 --> 42:43.600
It's all thanks to you

43:12.389 --> 43:13.429
this day

43:15.460 --> 43:17.159
really happy

43:19.199 --> 43:22.270
Never been so perfect in my life

43:23.600 --> 43:24.869
happy day

43:39.080 --> 43:40.449
Mom can't

43:42.150 --> 43:42.750
Mother

43:42.819 --> 43:44.259
If you want to do such an unpopular thing

43:44.319 --> 43:45.589
What else are you reading?

43:45.659 --> 43:47.830
It's better to tear them all up

43:48.429 --> 43:49.790
Mom, I know I was wrong

43:50.360 --> 43:51.900
"A gift to me"

43:52.429 --> 43:55.400
"Help me realize my unfulfilled dreams."

43:56.500 --> 43:57.699
What a joke

43:58.869 --> 44:02.239
Give birth to a worthless daughter like you

44:02.469 --> 44:03.810
is my shame

44:05.080 --> 44:06.139
do you know

44:10.250 --> 44:11.279
Mother

44:14.650 --> 44:15.920
Mother

45:52.250 --> 45:53.549
what are you doing here

45:55.350 --> 45:56.819
I see you are sleeping soundly

45:59.489 --> 46:00.630
Are you again

46:10.469 --> 46:12.600
Can I sit next to you? I'm a little scared.

46:25.580 --> 46:27.219
This is much better

46:46.239 --> 46:48.239
A day of running around in Seoul

46:48.310 --> 46:49.839
I thought you would be tired and have a good night's sleep

46:51.440 --> 46:52.710
And things turned out well

46:54.880 --> 46:55.880
That is to say

46:57.179 --> 46:59.080
I thought so too

47:01.819 --> 47:03.989
It's like I drank hundreds of bottles of soda

47:04.659 --> 47:07.190
Put me under Gao Meishu's oppression

47:07.259 --> 47:09.330
The pain accumulated for 6 years is clearly cleansed

47:14.569 --> 47:16.500
But that nightmare is not over

47:17.199 --> 47:18.569
What the hell is this dream?

47:20.440 --> 47:21.770
Are you really not going to tell me?

47:27.650 --> 47:30.750
That seemed to happen not long ago

47:33.080 --> 47:36.219
I took a time machine and went back to the future

47:38.560 --> 47:39.889
parents

47:40.630 --> 47:43.190
They all changed into what I imagined

47:43.960 --> 47:45.259
Everything looks great

47:46.529 --> 47:48.100
Wouldn't that be great? What's wrong?

47:50.100 --> 47:51.139
But

47:59.909 --> 48:00.949
never mind

48:02.480 --> 48:04.350
Are you actually showing off your skills at this time?

48:04.480 --> 48:06.750
It's nothing, just a weird dream

48:07.790 --> 48:08.819
Like it's boring and pointless

48:08.889 --> 48:10.659
Weird mess of a movie

48:19.659 --> 48:21.799
I actually went to see a movie a few days ago

48:25.170 --> 48:27.869
I also met my mother there

48:30.810 --> 48:32.179
That feeling is strange

48:33.139 --> 48:35.049
What it feels like to meet the person who abandoned me

48:42.250 --> 48:43.790
1988

48:44.589 --> 48:46.190
one year from now

48:48.230 --> 48:50.159
The person who left after giving birth to me

48:54.799 --> 48:55.799
you said

48:57.469 --> 48:59.869
It's not a dream, it's reality

49:01.069 --> 49:02.339
Just treat it as a dream?

49:08.250 --> 49:10.850
As long as I want to find her no matter what

49:11.020 --> 49:12.980
The world is not that big

49:15.020 --> 49:17.319
Even without a time machine

49:18.719 --> 49:20.659
I can also find out

49:21.460 --> 49:22.830
How is she doing where she is?

49:24.400 --> 49:25.560
but i didn't do that

49:26.860 --> 49:29.569
I didn't go to her even once

49:32.600 --> 49:34.339
Because that's her choice

49:36.569 --> 49:38.210
She would choose to express it that way

49:38.980 --> 49:40.679
We are in each other's life

49:42.710 --> 49:44.580
None exist

49:48.420 --> 49:50.960
So I’ve been living well like this until now.

49:51.860 --> 49:54.060
If it weren't for this car

50:01.100 --> 50:02.270
Or is this just an excuse I made?

50:04.739 --> 50:07.000
Do you just want to see her?

50:14.449 --> 50:15.650
Now that I’ve met someone

50:16.650 --> 50:17.719
So far

50:19.319 --> 50:20.489
Just treat it as temporary

50:21.219 --> 50:23.489
I had a dream and passed by like this

50:25.960 --> 50:28.630
Anyway, that's what I'm supposed to do here

50:30.389 --> 50:32.860
Don't interfere

50:33.400 --> 50:34.900
Things you shouldn't interfere with

50:47.650 --> 50:48.710
that dream

50:52.080 --> 50:53.380
actually

50:54.589 --> 50:55.589
in my dream

51:00.360 --> 51:02.630
that

51:03.330 --> 51:05.060
I have something to tell you

51:06.259 --> 51:07.270
elder brother

51:11.000 --> 51:12.569
You said you had something to say

51:13.799 --> 51:14.839
want to tell me

51:16.339 --> 51:18.409
What crazy things are you going to say again?

51:19.639 --> 51:20.750
Say it

51:30.790 --> 51:31.889
do you remember

51:34.960 --> 51:36.929
The summer vacation when I was 13 years old

51:38.659 --> 51:39.929
your first time

51:41.699 --> 51:43.770
hit me in your room

51:47.409 --> 51:49.069
Fortunately

51:51.139 --> 51:52.440
Mom has seen it

51:53.980 --> 51:57.520
How sad she must have been that day

51:58.850 --> 52:01.920
She was beaten by her husband all her life

52:04.319 --> 52:05.690
But I have to watch

52:07.589 --> 52:10.529
You bastard beat up her only daughter.

52:12.259 --> 52:15.969
What is this crazy woman talking about?

52:19.770 --> 52:23.369
But is she too sad?

52:24.880 --> 52:26.779
He actually turned a blind eye and walked away.

52:31.520 --> 52:32.520
right

52:38.960 --> 52:41.429
It happened countless times after that

52:42.659 --> 52:44.560
Is it possible that I am a transparent person?

52:45.830 --> 52:47.100
Even if I cry and shout

52:49.429 --> 52:51.839
Said I was in so much pain and discomfort

52:53.369 --> 52:54.839
But in that home

52:57.739 --> 52:59.440
It's like I don't exist bro

53:00.650 --> 53:02.409
So I want my mother to watch

53:03.710 --> 53:04.850
let mom

53:07.119 --> 53:09.119
have a look

53:16.989 --> 53:18.429
Is your hand healed?

53:20.230 --> 53:21.299
What

53:34.210 --> 53:36.679
It's all because you always like to drink

53:43.190 --> 53:44.960
will never get better

53:48.560 --> 53:49.730
Are you crazy

53:50.290 --> 53:52.159
How long have I been looking for you to come now?

53:53.860 --> 53:55.000
Where is the umbrella?

53:55.770 --> 53:59.170
How are you going to go back when it's raining so hard?

53:59.940 --> 54:02.139
Have you got the money?

54:05.179 --> 54:09.179
Hey, if you treat me like this, my mother will never let you go.

54:10.880 --> 54:11.949
Hello

54:12.319 --> 54:13.819
Why don't you help me up quickly?

54:20.190 --> 54:22.489
Lighter

54:28.330 --> 54:30.529
What the hell are you doing?

54:32.270 --> 54:34.839
Didn't I say it would hurt? Damn it?

54:35.639 --> 54:37.810
Be more careful

54:57.389 --> 54:58.500
What are you doing

55:03.230 --> 55:04.339
that hand

55:07.739 --> 55:08.969
Does it hurt?

55:12.440 --> 55:13.880
how painful it is

55:25.119 --> 55:29.230
What's wrong with my hands?

55:53.480 --> 55:56.549
What's wrong? What do you want to say?

55:58.960 --> 55:59.889
This is it

56:01.089 --> 56:04.600
Sometimes I look inside this car

56:05.500 --> 56:08.369
There will be a strange feeling

56:09.199 --> 56:12.040
I know this sounds unreasonable, but

56:13.600 --> 56:16.069
I always feel like what I’m looking at is

56:16.210 --> 56:18.339
Things that shouldn't be here

56:23.779 --> 56:25.819
It's okay. Just pretend I didn't say anything.

56:26.980 --> 56:31.159
It doesn't matter anyway, right?

56:32.719 --> 56:34.020
what does that mean

57:08.460 --> 57:09.529
Police officer

57:11.929 --> 57:13.659
I have something to say

57:18.440 --> 57:20.139
Now start what I said

57:21.610 --> 57:24.009
Can you please keep it a secret for me?

57:28.380 --> 57:31.650
If word gets out, I might really die.

57:34.319 --> 57:35.589
no matter what you want to say

57:36.520 --> 57:39.489
I promise I won't let you get any harm done

57:45.730 --> 57:47.500
Cases that happened in the village

57:51.170 --> 57:52.239
I have

57:57.069 --> 57:58.179
saw the murderer

58:02.880 --> 58:05.020
I saw him kill someone with my own eyes

58:07.949 --> 58:09.119
The murderer is my brother

58:17.730 --> 58:18.799
It is said that

58:20.860 --> 58:23.270
There was a murder in the village

58:24.699 --> 58:28.170
was recovered from the victim at that time

58:29.739 --> 58:32.580
My girlfriend’s waiter’s matchbox

58:34.310 --> 58:35.909
and note

58:42.350 --> 58:43.520
Could it be

58:46.290 --> 58:47.319
this one

59:03.170 --> 59:05.440
I didn't mean to see it

59:06.239 --> 59:09.710
I just went to the toilet during the day

59:20.989 --> 59:22.589
Picked this up

59:24.600 --> 59:25.799
But why

59:27.869 --> 59:30.270
you will have this

59:38.409 --> 59:39.440
No way

59:40.440 --> 59:41.850
is this really yours

59:45.850 --> 59:47.319
Just calm down and listen to my explanation.

59:52.319 --> 59:55.060
Who are you

59:55.960 --> 59:57.659
- What's going on? - Listen to me.

59:57.730 --> 59:58.799
What exactly are you

59:59.299 --> 01:00:00.600
who is

01:00:45.810 --> 01:00:47.739
-Teacher- Liu Fanlong

01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:50.250
teacher

01:00:50.679 --> 01:00:53.619
Something seems to have happened to Shun Ai

01:00:53.679 --> 01:00:55.150
You wake up

01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:56.049
This is wrong

01:00:56.119 --> 01:00:57.589
Everyone is dead anyway

01:01:00.719 --> 01:01:01.989
Can it still be saved now?

01:01:10.029 --> 01:01:11.400
Hae Kyung can't catch him
