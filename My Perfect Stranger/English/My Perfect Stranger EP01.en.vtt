01:13.209 --> 01:15.950
When I think back
it was a strange night.

01:24.760 --> 01:27.030
The vehicle is leaving the road.
I'm going to change my route

01:27.829 --> 01:29.590
Calculate new route.

01:29.659 --> 01:32.799
Everything that day
was twisted in the most natural way

01:33.000 --> 01:34.230
This doesn't happen every day.

01:47.909 --> 01:50.819
That's when it popped up in front of me.

01:53.989 --> 01:55.049
oh oh!

01:57.359 --> 01:58.359
Ouch!

How to use time machine

03:00.819 --> 03:01.849
Yes

03:02.150 --> 03:05.620
The kind in novels or movies.
A time machine like this.

03:05.620 --> 03:06.659
What's this?

03:08.090 --> 03:09.830
I have been a journalist for seven years.

03:10.460 --> 03:12.960
I only pursue facts.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.430
This is too idealistic for me.

03:15.530 --> 03:18.240
What kind of fantasy drama is this the protagonist of?

03:18.539 --> 03:20.099
I'm not interested in playing.

03:22.840 --> 03:24.810
But there is one factor I overlooked.

03:25.479 --> 03:27.580
Curiosity led to my own nemesis.

do you want to know what I saw that year?

What did I see there...

05:15.120 --> 05:16.589
what exactly is it?

05:36.839 --> 05:38.339
What do you see there?

05:38.779 --> 05:39.779
have no idea

05:40.879 --> 05:43.720
Anyway, after that incident

05:43.720 --> 05:46.319
My life started to go off track.

05:48.319 --> 05:50.920
You see, I'm just here to talk nonsense.
Now let's hear it.

05:52.189 --> 05:55.259
(supermarket)

05:55.360 --> 05:57.230
I think my uncle has gone crazy.

(Congratulations on becoming the host of
the 1988 Seoul Olympics)

05:59.060 --> 06:01.670
What a pity, just listen to his uncle.

06:04.300 --> 06:05.600
Do you still have what I just gave you?

06:07.339 --> 06:08.339
Yes

06:08.569 --> 06:10.240
I'll come back later to pay.

06:10.240 --> 06:11.480
If you want to eat something, eat it.

06:12.639 --> 06:14.550

From glue and butane gas

06:24.790 --> 06:26.220
It comes in the form of bleach and benzene.

- You take good care of the old man.
- Oh my God.

06:37.199 --> 06:39.199
- Oh
- I really want to thank you.

Do you all agree?

07:08.500 --> 07:10.430
- Agreed
- Of course.

07:10.569 --> 07:12.339
Let's drink.

07:13.040 --> 07:14.740

07:36.189 --> 07:37.430
- Oh my god
- Go ahead.

07:37.629 --> 07:39.459
- This guy said you don't have to do this.
- No.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.769
- Say something
- Come on

07:41.769 --> 07:43.670
- What does the principal have to say?
- Yes.

07:43.670 --> 07:45.800
Oh, thank you.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.040
- Great
- Great

07:47.610 --> 07:50.470
But I did nothing.

07:50.980 --> 07:54.610
First of all, I want to thank the villagers.
Yuting Village

07:54.810 --> 07:56.550
Very good people are capital.

07:58.050 --> 07:59.750
second

07:59.750 --> 08:02.649
I want to thank our children
for growing into such wonderful people.

08:02.649 --> 08:03.860
This is simply not true.

08:11.699 --> 08:13.800
No wonder
it ended in tragedy.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.100
Because even though we know very little about each other

08:15.100 --> 08:16.569
But you still believe each other with your eyes closed.

08:17.839 --> 08:19.139
What are you talking about him?

08:19.139 --> 08:20.839
- what did he say?
- How is this going?

08:21.170 --> 08:22.670
About 30 seconds later

08:23.339 --> 08:25.680
You will hear a scream.
It came from the mountains behind.

08:26.240 --> 08:27.910
Six naughty teenagers...

08:27.910 --> 08:29.750
They will begin to split up and run in six directions.

08:30.550 --> 08:32.519
Everyone was super drunk.

08:32.779 --> 08:35.450
And three of these six
are girls from this village.

08:35.690 --> 08:37.220
What is he saying?

08:37.220 --> 08:38.659
Are there any children in our village who are drunk after drinking glue?

08:38.659 --> 08:39.720
Maybe not?

08:39.720 --> 08:42.289
Television reporters had clues before the incident.

08:42.289 --> 08:43.830
Departing from Seoul

08:44.029 --> 08:45.529
- TV reporter?
- TV reporter?

08:45.529 --> 08:47.200
Five minutes later, the reporter arrived.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.830
You have approximately 4 minutes and 30 seconds.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.740
You need to solve this problem.

08:50.740 --> 08:53.700

09:07.149 --> 09:09.049
Another classmate, Park Yuri

09:09.220 --> 09:12.190
Wait, that's my niece.

09:12.190 --> 09:14.590
Are you sure you want to take the risk?

09:15.029 --> 09:17.429
According to the Toxic Substances Control Act...

09:18.600 --> 09:20.830
- What?
- What's that sound?

09:20.830 --> 09:22.929
- Is that the sound of people screaming?
- Yes, it's coming from over there.

09:23.899 --> 09:25.070
Has it been 30 seconds?

09:34.049 --> 09:36.179
This story is about our children.

09:37.750 --> 09:38.850
Let's believe him.

09:49.759 --> 09:51.629
No, that's not true at all.

09:52.029 --> 09:54.429
I did nothing.

09:56.230 --> 09:57.269
Oh my god.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.440
Drink, the water here is still clean.

10:07.909 --> 10:11.049
Who are you?

10:12.220 --> 10:14.149
Missed a step on the cliff over there…

10:14.320 --> 10:16.820
It was her destiny to end her life at the age of 19 .

10:16.820 --> 10:18.220
I just changed it to

10:18.559 --> 10:19.590
Who are you...

10:21.190 --> 10:24.559
very handsome

10:24.559 --> 10:27.600
- What's this? Hey, good girl...
- Eun-ha, oh my god.

10:27.600 --> 10:31.070
- Unbelievable, you crazy kid.
- Galaxy

10:31.070 --> 10:33.000
- This kid
- Oh my God.

10:33.139 --> 10:35.740
- Please calm down
- you crazy person.

10:35.740 --> 10:37.710
- pay attention
- oh, look at that

10:37.980 --> 10:39.710
- This is unbelievable.
- Let's go.

10:39.710 --> 10:41.980
Go straight and hurry up.

10:42.480 --> 10:45.750
- Come on.
- Here.

10:46.049 --> 10:47.450
What are you doing?

10:47.450 --> 10:48.889
- Attention
- Grandma, grandpa.

10:48.889 --> 10:50.820
- What did you do... what did you do?
- What?

10:50.820 --> 10:52.419
- Oh my God, what happened?
- What?

10:52.419 --> 10:54.129
Come quickly.

10:54.330 --> 10:56.730
- Come on oh my God
- Let's go

10:56.730 --> 10:58.500
- come here
- stop

10:59.659 --> 11:00.929
- He...
- What?

11:07.340 --> 11:08.509
Do I need to push?

11:10.409 --> 11:12.480
The one who tricks other kids into smelling glue
is you.

11:13.210 --> 11:15.250
She may make herself appear to be in danger.

11:15.250 --> 11:17.210
But others actually had to die.

11:17.620 --> 11:20.720
I don’t want to help a misbehaving kid.
Who killed two of his own friends?

11:20.720 --> 11:21.950
If you really want this, just say so.

11:22.450 --> 11:23.450
I'll help you push it down.

11:24.590 --> 11:25.889
What is this bastard?

11:26.789 --> 11:27.860
Can you forget about it for a while?

11:36.769 --> 11:37.840
("10 out of 10 glue sniffers killed two people")

11:40.970 --> 11:42.240
Wait a moment.

11:42.240 --> 11:43.870
Let's go and see.

11:58.360 --> 11:59.860
Oh, I was totally shocked.

11:59.990 --> 12:01.490
- Oh my God
- Damn, they survived.

12:02.090 --> 12:03.929
He saved her.

12:14.039 --> 12:16.809
Because your mother is different from other people.
So I think my life is very difficult.

12:18.039 --> 12:19.080
What?

12:21.379 --> 12:22.809
What do you want to know?

12:23.909 --> 12:25.980
Although her mother was a little different, she...

12:26.679 --> 12:28.190
I live for you.

12:32.059 --> 12:34.190
So don't do such a thing.
with friends again

12:34.460 --> 12:35.460
do you understand?

12:40.100 --> 12:41.470
I don't want to do that either.

12:43.899 --> 12:45.870
even without you

12:46.139 --> 12:48.740
There are still people in this village who are helping.
there are more

12:56.009 --> 12:57.620

13:01.289 --> 13:02.350

13:04.049 --> 13:05.220
("Wujing Village was selected as
the village that has been crime-free for five consecutive years)

13:05.220 --> 13:07.460
Oh, Dad.

13:07.460 --> 13:09.730
Oh my gosh, did you just remember that?

13:12.500 --> 13:14.700
The next news story is about unruly teenagers.

13:14.700 --> 13:16.870
has become a serious social problem

13:17.129 --> 13:20.169
Here are high school students who get drunk on glue.

13:24.440 --> 13:26.710

13:26.779 --> 13:29.210
God, be careful.

13:29.480 --> 13:30.750
Ouch!

13:30.750 --> 13:33.149
How can we thank you enough?

13:33.620 --> 13:35.320
This is just a temporary illusion.

13:35.950 --> 13:38.360
They were still in high school.

13:38.720 --> 13:41.559
Parents should comfort
and guide them well.

13:41.590 --> 13:44.159
Because that's
what adults should do.

13:44.500 --> 13:47.330
You said exactly what I thought.

13:47.799 --> 13:49.929
You know these things.
How are you?

13:50.129 --> 13:52.169
Know exactly what will happen when.

13:52.269 --> 13:54.509
It all happened like that.

13:54.509 --> 13:55.509

I?

14:06.750 --> 14:08.289
(Teaching Certificate)

14:08.690 --> 14:10.490
- Pretty much the same thing.
- What?

14:10.490 --> 14:11.960
I put it down.

14:12.460 --> 14:13.559
Oh, really.

14:13.559 --> 14:15.889
Teacher Yoon Haejun?

14:16.860 --> 14:18.330
Are you a teacher?

14:18.960 --> 14:19.960
Yes

14:21.000 --> 14:24.340
He accidentally moved from Seoul.
The time to come to our village is just right.

14:24.440 --> 14:26.039
- What?
- Really?

14:26.639 --> 14:27.639
That is...

14:28.570 --> 14:30.070
Sorry for asking.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.240
But have you found a new job?

14:32.740 --> 14:33.809
Not yet, not yet.

14:35.649 --> 14:39.419
There is a vacancy at the school I am currently in charge of .

14:39.879 --> 14:41.889
- Oh, is that right?
- Yes.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.620
What kind of coincidence could this be?

14:44.490 --> 14:46.159
I teach Korean.

14:46.389 --> 14:48.590
Yes, Teacher Yin.

14:48.590 --> 14:51.159
This was the beginning of my fake life.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.559
In 1987, in that village

14:57.600 --> 14:58.600
(teacher's office)

14:59.539 --> 15:01.139
(Korean language)

15:03.840 --> 15:05.779
- Teacher,
- go away.

15:06.309 --> 15:07.340
Go away.

15:07.379 --> 15:10.509
I'm the first one here, teacher.

15:14.919 --> 15:16.149
teacher

15:16.519 --> 15:18.759
I've become
someone I never wanted to be.

15:18.759 --> 15:20.019
That's the teacher

15:26.029 --> 15:28.370
and bought a house
in a remote village

15:28.899 --> 15:30.970
Something I never wanted to buy before.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.740
I lived like this for a whole month.

16:10.340 --> 16:12.279
Why do I have to do this?

16:12.279 --> 16:13.710
(Seoul 2021)

16:17.309 --> 16:20.350
The Yujing Village Serial Murder
Case happened in 1987

16:22.320 --> 16:24.659
The man you killed 34 years ago...

16:24.659 --> 16:26.720
Still alive in that place

16:28.690 --> 16:31.059
No, I didn't kill them.

16:38.399 --> 16:39.440
I know.

16:40.269 --> 16:41.309
What?

16:41.340 --> 16:43.509
That's why I went there.
Find out the real culprit

16:45.480 --> 16:47.440
This way you and I can survive.

16:50.250 --> 16:51.379
what are you saying?

16:55.950 --> 16:57.690
You'll be released tomorrow morning
, right?

16:57.960 --> 16:59.590
Let's meet in Yujing Village.

17:00.519 --> 17:02.889
I'll tell you what I'm talking about.

17:04.029 --> 17:05.700
Then before tomorrow morning...

17:06.259 --> 17:08.029
This also helps with survival.

17:27.920 --> 17:29.789
("The murderer of the Youjing Village serial murder case committed suicide")

17:29.789 --> 17:32.660
("The murderer of the Gojing Village serial murder case will be released tomorrow.")

18:09.430 --> 18:10.430
Mr. Yunyong, where are you?

18:10.630 --> 18:11.829
Is it coming?

18:11.829 --> 18:12.859
(Editor-in-Chief)

18:12.859 --> 18:14.430
I know today is your holiday.

18:14.430 --> 18:16.829
But the teacher only called Teacher Yin Ying.
what can I do?

18:17.940 --> 18:19.299
I will arrive soon.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.569
I realized I couldn't rest.

18:41.119 --> 18:42.390
(Mother)

18:43.430 --> 18:44.430
what else?

18:48.930 --> 18:50.200
Is it a video this time?

18:50.569 --> 18:51.740
What is this about?

18:51.799 --> 18:52.900
This is the video.

18:53.500 --> 18:57.539
Singing was very cute when I was a child
.

18:58.039 --> 19:00.509
Mom was worried because it was swollen.

19:00.740 --> 19:04.250
My son told me to convert it to a file.
You can put it in a USB.

19:04.880 --> 19:06.279
I understand, I will do the same next time.

19:06.279 --> 19:08.890
I committed to doing this for over a year.

19:10.150 --> 19:11.690
I didn't forget on purpose.

19:11.920 --> 19:13.259
Are you still busy these days?

19:13.960 --> 19:15.190
My child must be very tired.

19:16.130 --> 19:18.799
But how late is it now?
Are you going home today?

19:20.500 --> 19:21.529
today?

19:40.480 --> 19:43.049
Why do we celebrate our father’s birthday every year?

19:44.559 --> 19:46.920
Mom used to get flowers from him.
On your birthday?

19:48.859 --> 19:51.190
He rarely comes home.

19:53.160 --> 19:55.930
Preparing food for him
was always just the two of us.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.940
Because his father is very busy.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.039
what are you busy with?

20:02.809 --> 20:04.910
Busy, drunk,
having trouble hanging out with friends?

20:05.309 --> 20:07.950
Oh, come on.

20:07.950 --> 20:09.410
Mom can cook a lot of delicious food.

20:09.410 --> 20:11.720
I also make my kids’ favorite mixed vegetables.

20:12.619 --> 20:14.690
This doesn't have to be difficult.
Because I won't go.

20:17.490 --> 20:18.859
I will send you more money.

20:19.220 --> 20:21.220
You should go buy some new clothes
and get some fresh air.

20:21.930 --> 20:24.660
Stop watching old videos,
they are so depressing.

20:26.029 --> 20:27.099
That's it.

20:28.069 --> 20:31.269
Just asking:
Why is the murderer in my novel...

20:31.269 --> 20:32.970
Even if it’s only women?

20:34.269 --> 20:35.339
I have no idea.

20:36.640 --> 20:38.079
An old aunt like me comes to write novels

20:38.079 --> 20:39.609
You must not find it strange, right?

20:41.950 --> 20:43.880
Just like any man in this world...

20:43.880 --> 20:46.019
can murder

20:46.420 --> 20:49.890
Any woman can kill a man.
It's also cruel.

20:50.319 --> 20:51.660
I only choose stories...

20:51.990 --> 20:55.230
I'm more familiar with
it. Let's turn it into a novel.

20:56.759 --> 20:58.900
If so, let's move on to the next question.

20:58.900 --> 21:00.130
(Author discussion
with writer Gao Meishi)

21:01.029 --> 21:03.769
This is your first novel.
Published 1987

21:03.769 --> 21:04.940
"small door"

21:05.569 --> 21:08.170
This is the teacher's only novel...

21:08.170 --> 21:09.569
There is no murderer there

21:10.309 --> 21:12.609
Mr. Yin Ying's favorite novel is here.

21:14.980 --> 21:17.480
Yes, it led me to this hell.

21:17.480 --> 21:18.750
A novel that I both love and hate.

21:19.650 --> 21:22.519
This story was written by a teacher
when I was only nineteen years old.

21:23.650 --> 21:25.890
Isn’t it boring to talk about the past?

21:27.490 --> 21:29.660
Rather than talk about this, I'd like to...

21:29.660 --> 21:32.299
Introducing the most important people
in my life now

21:33.430 --> 21:34.869
over there in the back

21:35.869 --> 21:37.829
See that sparkly girl?

21:38.970 --> 21:42.170
She is a personal editor.
I mentioned it before

21:42.339 --> 21:44.069
Also my soul mate.

21:44.940 --> 21:46.309
Most of my successes...

21:46.640 --> 21:48.809
I got it because of her dedication.

21:56.490 --> 21:58.589
I can not believe it.
Who planned this event?

22:00.519 --> 22:01.759
I haven't been able to write much lately.

22:01.759 --> 22:03.559
And asked me to answer nonsense questions.

22:03.630 --> 22:06.029
When do we talk about old novels?

22:06.259 --> 22:08.200
Some novels have sold more than a million copies.
There are more volumes

22:08.200 --> 22:10.170
I'm still talking about
my first bad piece.

22:10.230 --> 22:12.670
Oh, and look at your own work again.

22:13.339 --> 22:14.740
do not you know?

22:14.740 --> 22:17.670
How many people became fans
because of the teacher's first novel?

22:18.910 --> 22:20.980
This is me.
who became the first fan

22:22.210 --> 22:24.509
If it weren't for
the sentences in the teacher's novel, I would...

22:24.509 --> 22:28.049
Hey, do you think I'm interested in her?

22:29.319 --> 22:30.390
So let's go back to the office, okay?

22:33.759 --> 22:35.559
Please take some of the pressure off me.

22:40.359 --> 22:43.099
Oh, my daughter.

22:44.230 --> 22:45.269
What?

22:48.509 --> 22:49.569
I'm going to start the car now.

22:55.750 --> 22:57.180
This kid is so cold.

22:58.049 --> 22:59.380
Do I want more money?

22:59.380 --> 23:01.690
I just want to see your face.

23:02.450 --> 23:03.589
This doesn't mean...

23:04.250 --> 23:08.230
I rewatch the video
because I have no money so I will die.

23:09.160 --> 23:10.190
Oh my god.

23:14.900 --> 23:16.529
Oh, it's so expensive.

23:22.839 --> 23:23.839
Hello

23:44.589 --> 23:46.160
Sorry to keep you waiting.

23:49.170 --> 23:51.200
- Can I see number 36?
- Can.

23:51.200 --> 23:52.240
What about restaurants?

23:52.569 --> 23:54.599
I made a reservation at the store across the street.

23:54.599 --> 23:57.140
You can go as soon as Ena arrives.

23:57.470 --> 23:59.710
I sent the address to Teacher Park.

24:03.950 --> 24:05.250
Did you see the introduction I sent you?

24:06.349 --> 24:08.049
Don't you see the dark circles under your eyes?

24:08.420 --> 24:11.490
I read it all night until I couldn't sleep.
It's really fun.

24:12.059 --> 24:13.160
Slightly relieved.

24:13.690 --> 24:15.759
This time, he won't be torn to pieces.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.029
She hates my job in many ways.

24:20.559 --> 24:22.470
No, Master,
why do you say that?

24:22.769 --> 24:24.940
There will be a good response.
Only after her verification.

24:25.640 --> 24:27.369
So I can't really complain.

24:30.940 --> 24:33.579
But anyone can check and fix this problem.

24:36.410 --> 24:39.019
Of course, all writers
are teachers.

24:40.250 --> 24:41.279
Bring it with you.

24:42.150 --> 24:45.720
It will go well this time, Master.
I can feel.

24:49.529 --> 24:52.529
It is often said that good shoes
will take you to good places.

24:54.259 --> 24:56.829
Why is she wearing those shoes?

25:23.130 --> 25:25.200
-Run away-
I want a pair.

25:25.200 --> 25:27.230
- What shoes?
- let me see.

25:27.230 --> 25:28.269
Mother?

25:28.269 --> 25:30.170
-Stop.
-Don't push.

25:30.170 --> 25:32.140
- Don't push me.
- Be careful.

25:32.140 --> 25:34.740
It's like a flea market.

25:34.869 --> 25:38.140
Just some stupid shoes on sale.
Why all the fuss?

25:38.140 --> 25:40.539
- What’s wrong with you?
- bring it on.

25:40.539 --> 25:41.779
- Yes, this is the sixth one.
- Sorry.

25:42.049 --> 25:43.480
Life is so miserable.

25:43.480 --> 25:45.920
- Very beautiful
- Size 6.5

25:45.920 --> 25:48.690
Even though people are poor, they still need to have a certain standard.

25:50.289 --> 25:52.690
You should remember this before you get older.

25:54.089 --> 25:56.029
- Mom
- Oh.

25:58.190 --> 25:59.559
Are you OK?

25:59.559 --> 26:01.500
What should we eat today?
I'm starving.

26:02.599 --> 26:04.869
I may not have eaten anything yet.
Because you have to follow your mom, right?

26:05.500 --> 26:07.099
I'm probably waiting for you, let's go.

26:07.099 --> 26:09.009
Brother, let’s go first
and talk after dinner.

26:09.009 --> 26:10.009
Yes

26:19.250 --> 26:20.319
Oh my god.

26:23.150 --> 26:24.150
oh

26:57.420 --> 26:58.490

real

27:26.079 --> 27:27.619
Are you crazy?

27:27.619 --> 27:29.690
Aren't you afraid of cars?

27:29.690 --> 27:31.690
I'm hard of hearing. I've called several times.

27:31.960 --> 27:35.190
Mom is thinking about this problem.
How much did you spend today?

27:36.059 --> 27:38.190
I know, don't raise your voice.

27:38.190 --> 27:39.559
I didn't raise my voice.

27:39.559 --> 27:42.130
Hey, cool, try this.

27:42.730 --> 27:43.730
what else?

27:48.910 --> 27:51.470
If it doesn’t fit, try it on quickly.
Mom will take it to change.

27:52.509 --> 27:53.609
Do you want me to give it to you too?

27:55.150 --> 27:56.609
No, talk about it later.

27:56.950 --> 27:58.950
- I don't want
- oh, this child.

27:59.150 --> 28:01.990
He said I would try again later and got up.

28:03.390 --> 28:05.460
I know, okay.

28:09.660 --> 28:12.730
- Are you satisfied?
- Perfect fit, right?

28:14.029 --> 28:15.500
Or is it because your daughter is beautiful?

28:15.730 --> 28:17.230
The shoes look shiny.

28:18.130 --> 28:20.569
It is often said that good shoes
will take you to good places.

28:23.740 --> 28:25.640
Who would believe such a thing? It's just nonsense.

28:27.740 --> 28:30.779
Hey, these are not cheap shoes.

28:31.150 --> 28:32.950
Mom doesn't buy it.
From the store where the child met the mother, stand up and look.

28:32.950 --> 28:34.750
Mom went to their store and bought it at full price.

28:35.119 --> 28:37.150
This is good stuff.

28:37.450 --> 28:38.890
I said nothing here.

28:42.759 --> 28:43.890
Who told you to buy it?

28:44.859 --> 28:47.460
I told my mother to take the money.
Go buy some beautiful clothes for yourself?

28:48.200 --> 28:50.069
Mom has no place to show off.

28:50.200 --> 28:51.500
That is why.

28:51.500 --> 28:52.799
So don't dress like this...

28:53.670 --> 28:54.940
- What's this
?

28:55.640 --> 28:57.670
How many times have I told you to throw it away?

28:57.670 --> 29:00.809
Why do you love this decade-old vintage scarf?

29:01.380 --> 29:02.680
Look at other people around you.

29:03.109 --> 29:05.680
Who wears such clothes? look.

29:07.049 --> 29:08.920
I should never have bought it for my mom in the first place.

29:09.450 --> 29:11.890
I get it and my ears are going to explode.
Don't shout.

29:13.619 --> 29:14.819
Do you embarrass your child so much?

29:22.869 --> 29:25.599
I only work with smart, level-headed people.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.539
People like mothers are a laughingstock to their children.

29:31.769 --> 29:33.440
Why do you say that?

29:35.279 --> 29:36.509
But you know what?

29:37.279 --> 29:40.819
Even if your child is wearing dirty shoes
and an old-fashioned scarf

29:40.819 --> 29:41.990
A mother never neglects her child.

29:42.750 --> 29:43.789
that's right...

29:44.390 --> 29:48.730
No matter what your child wears or does.
A mother never neglects her child.

29:48.730 --> 29:49.759
do you understand?

29:50.960 --> 29:52.029
And mom...

29:55.400 --> 29:57.099
The mother doesn't know how to play with her child either.

30:02.369 --> 30:03.539
Mother

30:04.569 --> 30:05.609
then...

30:06.609 --> 30:08.680
If I didn't let my mother go like this...

30:10.680 --> 30:11.950
real

30:12.420 --> 30:13.980
Will anything change?

30:14.819 --> 30:16.089
I don't play either.

30:18.289 --> 30:19.759
- Do you want this bag?
- Yes.

30:22.759 --> 30:25.700
I think there's plenty of time
to make up for this.

30:49.049 --> 30:51.819
Oh, it's me. Did you have meal?

30:53.519 --> 30:54.720
Because I'm still a mother.

30:55.490 --> 30:56.559
Because one person is a mother...

30:57.690 --> 31:00.460
He will always be waiting for us no matter what.

Yes, I'm talking.

But mom...

31:45.509 --> 31:46.680

32:04.259 --> 32:05.759
There seems to be a suicide note.

Don’t you have a mother?

33:51.369 --> 33:55.940

- Mother

34:04.710 --> 34:05.779
"Mother"

34:05.980 --> 34:07.480
Mother...

34:07.519 --> 34:08.849
When I say this word...

34:10.320 --> 34:12.219
- No one answered
- That's not true

34:23.429 --> 34:25.030
(May 9,
writer Gao Meishi)

34:27.400 --> 34:28.400
(I've lost my patience with you)

34:28.400 --> 34:29.539
(You may need to find another publisher.)

34:29.539 --> 34:30.610
(delete)

34:38.380 --> 34:40.380
Still can't contact your father?

34:42.050 --> 34:43.849
I don't understand
why you come here?

34:45.019 --> 34:46.619
In this Wujing Village

34:50.030 --> 34:51.760
I've never heard of it before.

34:55.400 --> 34:57.030
And it's also far away from our home.

34:57.269 --> 35:00.000
(Police Detective)

35:00.039 --> 35:01.539
We still need to investigate further.

35:05.210 --> 35:06.280
But you should check this out.

35:06.940 --> 35:08.809
I think he intended to send it to his daughter.

35:17.019 --> 35:19.090
(Father)

35:20.090 --> 35:21.119
Father

35:21.119 --> 35:22.190
Is that Yoon Young?

35:22.860 --> 35:24.590
Her father was in trouble again.

35:24.690 --> 35:26.659
I won't give in this time.

35:26.659 --> 35:29.230
Do you know how many plates he broke?

35:29.369 --> 35:30.570
Ah what?

35:31.099 --> 35:33.699
Oh, don't puke there.

35:33.699 --> 35:35.039
really too much

35:35.710 --> 35:36.739
Oh my god.

35:37.840 --> 35:39.840
Send me the account number and amount.

35:41.239 --> 35:43.179
Compensate for all losses
he has promised so far

35:45.050 --> 35:46.320
I'll forward it to you now.

35:51.719 --> 35:53.289
I'm afraid you won't come.

35:53.289 --> 35:56.329
No, I'm worried you won't come.

35:57.030 --> 35:58.130
I felt a little relieved.

36:08.340 --> 36:11.710
who are you?

36:12.039 --> 36:13.179
how do you know?

36:13.380 --> 36:14.880
You have to ask.

36:16.210 --> 36:18.449
How do I know?
You are not a bad person...

36:18.449 --> 36:20.349
Since 34 years ago, or...

36:20.920 --> 36:22.050
how could I know...

36:22.050 --> 36:24.090
The night before being released...

36:24.090 --> 36:25.619
You will hang yourself.

36:28.019 --> 36:30.130
I told you the answer last night.

36:30.489 --> 36:34.329
I think I'll believe it.
Are you talking nonsense?

36:34.429 --> 36:36.900
Do you really want me to believe that
you really went back in time?

36:39.699 --> 36:40.699
alright.

36:41.869 --> 36:44.309
Because I've been rotting in prison for thirty years.

36:44.510 --> 36:45.780
So I thought of making fun of it.

36:45.780 --> 36:47.679
I don't know about this.
Real world, damn?

36:57.219 --> 36:59.059
There are still 16 years to go.

37:00.989 --> 37:04.230
I plan on going head to head.
And retired at a young age

37:05.230 --> 37:07.300
I will go fishing, read books...

37:07.300 --> 37:09.530
In such a quiet village
I want to continue playing.

37:10.429 --> 37:12.469
That used to be my dream.

37:14.039 --> 37:15.969
This was the path I chose.

37:21.579 --> 37:24.610
But by 2037
, that is, 16 years later.

37:25.679 --> 37:27.679
I want to see my simple dreams come true.
is this real?

37:27.679 --> 37:29.389
I'm just going to check it out and come back.

37:29.389 --> 37:30.590
(Time Travel System, 2021)

37:32.920 --> 37:35.889
(Time travel system, 2037)

37:36.960 --> 37:37.960
However...

37:39.630 --> 37:40.760
I can not do it.

37:43.900 --> 37:45.269
My dream cannot come true.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.969
Because I died young

37:52.780 --> 37:54.110
one year from now

37:54.679 --> 37:57.150
I will die at the age of 35.

37:58.150 --> 38:01.050
Do you want to know about my death?
What does this have to do with you?

38:01.050 --> 38:02.050
because...

38:04.150 --> 38:06.659
The villain who killed me is the real villain...

38:06.820 --> 38:09.860
In Serial Murder Case
Yujingcun, 1987

38:10.429 --> 38:11.429
how do you say?

38:12.190 --> 38:13.860
What is that about...

38:20.239 --> 38:22.809
(Bangbang Tea House)

38:24.070 --> 38:25.739
(Seoul Mo 0508)

38:36.190 --> 38:37.349
(Bangbang Tea House)

38:37.349 --> 38:39.559
That was the symbol of the 1987 villain.

38:44.190 --> 38:46.599
It was also found at the scene of my murder.

38:47.460 --> 38:50.030
Of course you are the first.
police are looking for

38:50.230 --> 38:51.869
but you...

38:53.739 --> 38:55.710
He even died before me.

38:59.010 --> 39:00.710
You said you didn't kill anyone.

39:01.309 --> 39:02.909
can't stand injustice

39:04.380 --> 39:06.050
The night before you were released,
it was yesterday

39:06.579 --> 39:09.019
You hanged yourself in your cell.

39:09.519 --> 39:10.619
impossible

39:13.860 --> 39:14.889
how do you know?

39:15.019 --> 39:16.190
That doesn't make sense at all, does it?

39:16.760 --> 39:18.329
How can a dead man kill me?

39:24.199 --> 39:26.500
So I decided to believe you were innocent.

39:27.670 --> 39:28.840
how do you say?

39:30.409 --> 39:31.809
Can I believe it?

39:39.949 --> 39:41.150
This is the real villain.

39:42.079 --> 39:43.289
Can we really find it?

39:45.690 --> 39:46.789
You have to get it.

39:47.659 --> 39:49.590
How did I drive off the road?

39:54.659 --> 39:56.800
This is the only way.
You and I will have a chance...

39:56.800 --> 39:58.230
have a proper life

40:35.300 --> 40:37.710
(To Yin Ying)

40:40.210 --> 40:41.280
Yoon Young

40:42.480 --> 40:45.409
I'm sorry I made you angry.

40:45.880 --> 40:46.949
And mom...

40:50.320 --> 40:52.289
The mother doesn't know how to play with her child either.

40:54.360 --> 40:56.059
After the children move out

40:56.559 --> 40:57.590
Mother

40:57.829 --> 41:00.730
Mom couldn't help but lament that
we were drifting apart

41:01.000 --> 41:03.500
Mom may be trying to appear angry.

41:09.340 --> 41:13.039
Oops, the frogs are singing.

41:13.039 --> 41:14.679
Son, grandson, daughter-in-law

41:14.679 --> 41:16.150
let's get together

41:16.150 --> 41:18.510
Singing all night long but no one wanted to listen.

41:18.510 --> 41:20.550
During this time, my mother no longer missed me.
I couldn't do it as a kid.

41:21.449 --> 41:23.050
when the child was young

41:23.550 --> 41:26.119
My kids used to sing the frog song.

41:27.019 --> 41:28.960
I will always play with you.

41:29.230 --> 41:31.289
Even if my mother turns into a gray-haired grandma

41:31.289 --> 41:33.130
I play with my mother every day.

41:33.329 --> 41:35.360
That's why I have to play...

41:35.360 --> 41:37.769
-Your little mouth used to talk all the time. -For
me too. All right.

41:38.099 --> 41:39.440
Baby’s little hands are so cute

41:40.239 --> 41:43.409
Oh no, no.

41:45.340 --> 41:46.880
Ouch!

41:52.679 --> 41:56.889
If mom could travel through time and space

41:57.820 --> 41:58.849
Mom also wants to...

42:00.219 --> 42:03.929
Go back to that time
and hold those hands again

42:05.030 --> 42:07.030
cute little hands of child

42:08.400 --> 42:09.570
Yoon Young

42:10.630 --> 42:12.500
Mom will never forget.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.800
If only my mom could do it.

42:16.739 --> 42:19.039
Mom wants to play with her baby...

42:19.039 --> 42:21.840
For the rest of my life
, until my mother turns into a gray-haired grandma.

42:23.309 --> 42:25.050
From this mother who loves her children

43:03.719 --> 43:07.059
(Bangbang Tea House)

43:19.599 --> 43:20.639
"Book" right?

43:20.639 --> 43:22.340
(Book...)

43:22.710 --> 43:23.969
That is...

43:29.039 --> 43:30.380
Yoon Young

44:03.550 --> 44:05.250
Why didn't my mother answer the phone when she called me?

44:06.880 --> 44:09.349
Before my mother passed away, she called my father three times.

44:11.920 --> 44:13.320
Are you ignoring your mother again?

44:14.860 --> 44:15.920
let's go.

44:16.590 --> 44:19.760
We should start from here. Let's go find the children's mother.

44:21.960 --> 44:23.269
Where can mom go?

44:25.300 --> 44:26.900
How can we find mom?

44:28.739 --> 44:30.769
- Yunying-
Dad.

44:32.710 --> 44:35.639
Do you know why I keep wanting to leave?
Away from hometown

44:38.679 --> 44:41.280
Because I hate seeing
father and mother living together.

44:43.389 --> 44:44.489
That's why.

44:45.889 --> 44:47.320
When we're together, we argue.

44:47.820 --> 44:49.389
Every time we quarreled my father then left the house.

44:51.929 --> 44:53.530
And mom will always wait for dad.

44:54.400 --> 44:57.900
I hate seeing this every day.
To escape from there

45:00.469 --> 45:03.010
Even though I know in the end
my mother will be alone.

45:04.940 --> 45:06.539
But my mother said she missed me.

45:11.250 --> 45:12.849
If mom could go back in time

45:15.280 --> 45:17.219
Mom was stupid enough to say she would come find me again.

45:25.190 --> 45:26.360
I am...

45:30.230 --> 45:32.369
I want to go back in time.
Dad, you can really go back.

45:35.300 --> 45:36.869
If I could turn back time

45:38.610 --> 45:40.010
I would take the long way back.

45:42.340 --> 45:43.849
This way mom doesn't have to...

45:45.909 --> 45:47.019
love daddy

45:48.820 --> 45:50.590
Or love me again

45:52.690 --> 45:54.760
Mom doesn't have to live with anyone...

45:56.760 --> 45:58.489
This makes my mother feel lonely
and deceives her into waiting for a lifetime.

46:00.159 --> 46:01.659
I will make my mother happy...

46:04.130 --> 46:05.630
Finish life by yourself

46:07.840 --> 46:09.139
I will let mom live.

46:12.840 --> 46:14.110
But I can't.

46:19.179 --> 46:20.650
Because it's impossible

47:28.980 --> 47:30.320
If you become obsolete, you will die.

47:33.489 --> 47:35.760
I'll buy you something better than this.
Let's go to the mall together.

47:35.760 --> 47:38.030
Expensive things are not necessarily good things, but this one is beautiful.

47:38.789 --> 47:40.929
This is my mom's favorite.

47:41.400 --> 47:42.829
The color suits you well too.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.400
My daughter uses her salary.
Start with your first part-time job

47:45.400 --> 47:46.800
Come and buy it for me.

47:47.599 --> 47:49.269
With these little hands...

47:49.570 --> 47:52.469
Oh, I'm disappointed with the money.
But you can buy it for me.

47:53.340 --> 47:54.909
it's not a big deal.

47:54.909 --> 47:57.449
My daughter goes to college near here.

47:57.650 --> 47:59.619
I'm here to visit
your university.

47:59.619 --> 48:02.780
It is because of my daughter that
I was able to go to college.

48:03.590 --> 48:05.889
- You must be happy
- Yes

48:10.590 --> 48:12.860

48:52.929 --> 48:57.210

50:01.400 --> 50:06.380
Lay a piece of silk in my heart
and stand at the end of your alley

50:07.079 --> 50:12.349
I will welcome you with beautiful candles.

50:12.780 --> 50:17.750
I turned into a butterfly
and walked on the fragrant flower road

50:21.260 --> 50:23.489
I will fly and stop in your heart.

50:24.030 --> 50:28.199
Our words become songs and poems.

50:29.730 --> 50:34.639
I'll sing to you
after laying the carpet on my heart

50:36.409 --> 50:40.139
Do you know what that feels like?

50:42.039 --> 50:46.579
my carpeted heart

51:10.170 --> 51:15.010
Lay a piece of silk in my heart
and stand at the end of your alley

51:15.880 --> 51:21.050
I will welcome you with beautiful candles.

51:42.900 --> 51:43.909
Wait a moment.

51:45.010 --> 51:46.010
ha!

51:47.039 --> 51:48.079
Hey!

51:48.739 --> 51:50.309
Hey!

52:13.570 --> 52:16.570
That day, I brought the shoes my mother bought for me.

- This way, please.

54:08.019 --> 54:10.949
Not that expensive.

54:12.050 --> 54:14.059
Come on, try it first.

54:14.820 --> 54:16.690
It's well worth it.

54:16.889 --> 54:19.389

It's not like that.

55:23.190 --> 55:24.460
I am fine.

55:24.960 --> 55:27.400
Wait, what happened?

55:27.829 --> 55:29.260
Your face is also pale.

55:29.260 --> 55:30.969
You should go to the hospital.

55:31.230 --> 55:33.030
It's not because of you.

55:33.500 --> 55:34.840
Just focus on yourself.

55:37.210 --> 55:39.840
Don't break your word, do you understand?

Sorry, I'm very tired today.

56:25.119 --> 56:26.989
Can you let me pass?

56:27.559 --> 56:29.860
There is something going on with friends.

56:30.230 --> 56:31.659

56:47.809 --> 56:49.239
If you finish third, you'll also get a Walkman.

56:49.340 --> 56:51.179
My sister and I are going to participate in the competition tomorrow.

56:52.110 --> 56:54.280
That number was entered incorrectly, right?

56:55.420 --> 56:56.579
What day is tomorrow?

56:57.119 --> 56:58.389
"May 10th" Sunday

56:58.489 --> 57:00.789
Does it have to be "Day 4"
instead of "Day 3"?

57:01.190 --> 57:03.389
This is not that story, "1987."

57:05.389 --> 57:07.230
It’s already 2021.

57:08.659 --> 57:09.960
What's this? I am afraid.

57:11.530 --> 57:12.570
Is it really painful?

57:13.230 --> 57:15.000
(May 10, 1987)

57:18.869 --> 57:20.340
(Meet So Bangcha at Moon Night Club)

57:22.539 --> 57:25.010
(Moon Nightclub)

57:25.550 --> 57:27.750
Brother, you go home,
I won't disturb you anymore.

57:31.449 --> 57:33.989
Is this really 1987?

57:35.690 --> 57:38.030
The 1988 Olympic Games will be held next year.
I really do not know.

57:42.900 --> 57:43.929
club?

57:47.070 --> 57:48.570
Do you really want to go to the club?

57:55.440 --> 57:56.510
Then...

57:57.449 --> 57:59.610
I think it's too late now.
Shall we go to the amusement park?

57:59.849 --> 58:02.250
Not really, but so what?

58:03.119 --> 58:04.719
We are still just students.

58:05.150 --> 58:07.019
"We are still just students."

58:07.260 --> 58:10.159
Hey, Li Shanai wants to praise
herself as an excellent student?

58:10.230 --> 58:12.260
In a few days, we will be 20 years old.

58:12.260 --> 58:14.329
Go clubbing for a few months first.
What would that look like?

58:14.329 --> 58:15.329
And one more thing...

58:16.130 --> 58:18.730
They had just been caught sniffing glue.

58:21.369 --> 58:22.599
Will it really be okay?

58:22.800 --> 58:23.869
Therefore...

58:24.570 --> 58:26.239
So we have to take her with us.

58:26.769 --> 58:29.409
Please be careful when you talk to your mother this time .

58:29.409 --> 58:30.949
We went to study together...

58:30.949 --> 58:33.210
Staying at your house all night, do you understand?

58:37.150 --> 58:39.690
I don't like lying.

58:40.260 --> 58:41.320
this

58:43.260 --> 58:44.929
Do we really have to take this girl with us?

58:46.159 --> 58:47.360
that's right.

58:48.099 --> 58:50.429
She must be complicit.
To keep our stories consistent

58:50.630 --> 58:53.230
Last time she told my mom
we didn't travel together.

58:53.230 --> 58:55.000
So I was beaten almost to death by my mother.

59:01.110 --> 59:02.780
I must die...

59:03.340 --> 59:05.949
Before marrying Hae Sung hyung?

59:10.489 --> 59:11.619
understand

59:15.090 --> 59:16.989
But will you let this girl go on like this?

59:17.190 --> 59:18.760
No more we don't want to be kicked out...

59:18.760 --> 59:19.889
From entrance to club

59:20.360 --> 59:22.400
Oh my God, this is...

59:23.199 --> 59:24.829
what do I do?

59:25.070 --> 59:26.599
what do I do?

59:28.500 --> 59:30.000
(Quan Yingnuo)

59:33.170 --> 59:34.210
This would say...

59:34.809 --> 59:36.340
This year is 1987?

59:37.510 --> 59:39.550
If you are sick, go to the hospital.

59:39.550 --> 59:41.079
Don't do this in front of someone else's store.

59:42.519 --> 59:44.050
real

59:44.690 --> 59:46.619
If you're joking, you have to have boundaries.

59:46.619 --> 59:48.559
Have I ever told you I'm not in the mood right now?

59:50.460 --> 59:51.760
Is this a filming location?

59:51.760 --> 59:53.159
Where are we now?

59:54.429 --> 59:55.659
yes...

59:56.130 --> 59:57.599
This is Wujing Village.

59:57.699 --> 01:00:00.940
I don't know what "shooting location"
means?

01:00:04.239 --> 01:00:05.239
It doesn't matter.

01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:07.239
I can find the answer myself.

01:00:09.010 --> 01:00:10.039
oh

01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:13.980
what is that?

01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:21.719
(Please check the connection
and try again)

01:00:22.059 --> 01:00:23.420
No signal here?

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:31.829
Can't access the Internet here?

01:00:32.469 --> 01:00:33.530
what is it?

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.670
- no signal?
- What signal?

01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:42.280
What's going on around here?

01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:48.550
Brother, please come back
, don't come back again.

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.519
Damn, I almost dug my own grave.

01:00:56.590 --> 01:00:58.159
- Is it this one?
- Yes.

01:00:58.590 --> 01:00:59.829
unless...

01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:05.570
- we look great
- let 's go

01:01:07.699 --> 01:01:08.769
damn it.

01:01:10.199 --> 01:01:12.670
Learn to watch horses and boats.

01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:14.010
Yes, sorry.

01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:50.179
Oops, the frogs are singing.

01:01:50.579 --> 01:01:52.550
Son, grandson, daughter-in-law

01:01:52.550 --> 01:01:54.079
let's get together

01:01:54.079 --> 01:01:57.420
Singing all night long but no one wanted to listen.

01:02:10.130 --> 01:02:11.130
Mother

01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:18.510
Mother

01:02:48.369 --> 01:02:49.369
This is real.

01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:52.369
Sorry, I'll explain everything.

01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:56.309
Yes

01:02:57.110 --> 01:02:58.949
You're probably still in shock right now.

01:02:59.409 --> 01:03:02.519
But it's worse than you think.

01:03:03.849 --> 01:03:05.750
We just...

01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:10.119
Back in 1987.

01:03:11.230 --> 01:03:12.429
And there is no way...

01:03:13.929 --> 01:03:15.000
You can go back.

01:03:15.699 --> 01:03:17.469
We're stuck here.

01:03:25.610 --> 01:03:26.710
is this real?

01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:29.380
Yes

01:03:29.579 --> 01:03:30.809
Oh my god.

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:33.409
Don't be too scared.

01:03:33.409 --> 01:03:35.480
I will do everything...

01:03:36.719 --> 01:03:37.820
If this is the case...

01:03:38.519 --> 01:03:41.420
It's true, damn.

01:03:43.989 --> 01:03:45.030
sorry.

01:04:16.889 --> 01:04:17.960
are you laughing?

01:04:30.139 --> 01:04:31.139
(Thanks to actor Kim Hye-eun)

01:04:31.139 --> 01:04:32.139
(And actor Kim Hyun-mok
who was invited to perform)

01:04:50.519 --> 01:04:53.289
(Time travel system from 2021 to 1987)

01:04:53.530 --> 01:04:55.360
(my perfect stranger)

01:04:55.730 --> 01:04:57.570
This is real?

01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:00.030
Is my mother still alive?

01:05:00.030 --> 01:05:01.699
- Mom
- Don't do this.

01:05:01.699 --> 01:05:03.769
Do you want to hit me?

01:05:03.769 --> 01:05:06.539
Mom, what's wrong? Why did I hit you?

01:05:06.539 --> 01:05:09.440
Okay, we're going to start hitting.
Youth is gone

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:11.050
What are kids like you doing here?

01:05:11.050 --> 01:05:13.010
- Come here quickly
- You are not a student of our school

01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:14.179
Yes, that's you.

01:05:14.179 --> 01:05:15.650
Why do you have to pretend not to know?

01:05:15.650 --> 01:05:16.650
Are you here to travel?

01:05:16.650 --> 01:05:18.389
Why did you enter the club?

01:05:18.389 --> 01:05:20.289
He suddenly looked at me...

01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:22.719
I don't know what your name is.

01:05:22.719 --> 01:05:24.329
My name is Baek Hee-seop.

01:05:26.929 --> 01:05:28.960
(Conclusion)

01:05:36.139 --> 01:05:38.039
Where have you been so late?

01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:41.210
Yuting Village

01:05:43.079 --> 01:05:44.110
Wujing Village?

01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:49.050
Yuting Village is your hometown?

01:05:50.949 --> 01:05:52.119
Why did you end up there all of a sudden?

01:05:53.090 --> 01:05:54.190
fit...

01:05:57.059 --> 01:05:58.690
Something needs to be resolved.
