"The Stranger I Met"
Episode 12

00:16.580 --> 00:19.119
(Wu Jindong)

00:28.830 --> 00:31.499
(Kyung Gi Joo)

00:40.810 --> 00:44.009
"A Stranger I Met"

00:45.380 --> 00:46.950
Do you remember these people?

00:47.079 --> 00:48.349
May 14, 1987

00:48.350 --> 00:50.749
Two female victims were killed in turn

00:50.920 --> 00:53.550
The girl who has not yet been found

00:54.219 --> 00:57.389
This was
the list of prime suspects at the time.

00:57.660 --> 00:59.459
The first suspect is Baksa

00:59.630 --> 01:01.359
The second suspect is Yu Bum Yong

01:01.600 --> 01:03.059
The third suspect?

01:03.060 --> 01:05.069
Gomin Su jailed for 30 years

01:06.399 --> 01:07.539
Hello

01:13.470 --> 01:14.780
(Bangbang Teahouse)

01:18.280 --> 01:20.380
Almost impossible with those fingers

01:22.149 --> 01:24.519
I am currently
unable to do any form of bundling

01:24.520 --> 01:26.719
Both are wearing red ties

01:26.720 --> 01:27.720
Because I found it

01:27.959 --> 01:30.519
Yubum's fear
has nothing to do with murder

01:30.520 --> 01:31.788
Red body (communism).

01:31.789 --> 01:33.228
Afraid of being caught if I don’t report it

01:33.229 --> 01:34.530
Is this what you're afraid of?

01:36.660 --> 01:39.429
Covering up a crime is not murder

01:39.699 --> 01:42.800
Not arresting college students who commit crimes worse than murder

01:44.569 --> 01:46.209
You must come with us now

01:46.539 --> 01:48.780
Looking for your brother Bayusup

01:59.020 --> 02:01.360
( Suspect in Wu Jong-il serial murder case )

02:01.789 --> 02:05.360
(Episode 12 - The Absent One)

02:11.899 --> 02:13.870
who I am?

02:17.500 --> 02:18.910
Who do you think I am?

02:22.579 --> 02:24.180
Article (12)

02:24.710 --> 02:28.019
(Deadline for reporting suspects)

02:32.590 --> 02:33.789
what are you saying?

02:33.919 --> 02:35.460
who do i want to be

02:36.160 --> 02:37.660
Why are you here?

02:39.889 --> 02:41.999
If you really want to know who I am

02:42.000 --> 02:43.460
go to police station

02:44.729 --> 02:46.630
We found this at home

02:47.430 --> 02:48.739
in our garage

02:49.299 --> 02:51.139
There are many strange things

02:51.769 --> 02:53.310
Very strange person

02:54.410 --> 02:56.410
Tell the police to identify

02:58.350 --> 02:59.710
This can also be done

03:00.780 --> 03:02.150
Have you finally come to me?

03:03.919 --> 03:05.549
because i can't do it

03:06.449 --> 03:07.519
Yes or no

03:14.960 --> 03:16.759
- Hey, come on
- Come on

03:16.930 --> 03:18.000
Let's go quickly

03:18.530 --> 03:19.930
- where
- here

03:20.299 --> 03:22.340
- Hey
- Hey guys

03:24.769 --> 03:26.669
- Finally caught this guy
- Ha!

03:30.539 --> 03:33.280
- What the hell happened
- Back off

03:36.319 --> 03:37.789
what do you do now?

03:49.060 --> 03:50.100
Already found

03:53.569 --> 03:54.669
I have found

03:57.440 --> 04:00.609
(Bangbang Teahouse)

04:02.280 --> 04:03.810
Because I thought there wasn't

04:06.479 --> 04:08.079
Otherwise it would be fine

04:09.220 --> 04:10.519
That's because I thought of it

04:12.549 --> 04:15.660
Because only then will you know what you really want to know

04:19.229 --> 04:20.760
Is this why you came to me?

04:21.359 --> 04:22.460
No need to go to the police station

04:26.669 --> 04:29.700
If you really need an answer,
my answer is no

04:30.669 --> 04:32.809
Although I can't explain everything here

04:33.570 --> 04:36.879
I won't do anything you suspect

04:37.580 --> 04:38.749
I do not believe you

04:44.249 --> 04:45.320
is that so

04:48.760 --> 04:49.919
I can not afford it

04:51.830 --> 04:52.859
but..

04:54.960 --> 04:56.460
if you hide it

04:57.830 --> 05:00.330
You will be able to continue repairing the car

05:00.400 --> 05:02.070
Now what does this matter?

05:03.169 --> 05:04.299
if you do

05:04.840 --> 05:07.070
I don’t know if you can solve it yourself.

05:08.640 --> 05:09.780
who I am?

05:11.679 --> 05:12.979
What is this all about?

06:14.039 --> 06:15.840
Why, what happened?

06:17.780 --> 06:19.049
What's wrong?

06:27.890 --> 06:29.489
(Bangbang Teahouse)

06:29.859 --> 06:31.059
My fault

06:33.059 --> 06:35.400
Be careful when entering and exiting the house

06:45.340 --> 06:46.369
Don't worry

06:47.070 --> 06:48.510
times..

06:49.010 --> 06:50.510
This means that it will be temporarily overwritten

06:52.479 --> 06:55.619
Although it will be because of the car and not because of me

06:59.590 --> 07:01.090
How are you?

07:10.799 --> 07:12.200
Walk?

07:14.700 --> 07:16.640
Although we don't have much time

07:17.700 --> 07:18.739
but also

07:19.640 --> 07:22.439
I think it's time for a little breeze

08:05.720 --> 08:07.320
i met my family

08:09.660 --> 08:10.689
That is..

08:12.660 --> 08:15.660
Facing an unfamiliar
family member’s face

08:16.960 --> 08:18.429
I don't think it's an easy thing

08:27.439 --> 08:29.340
Although I haven’t traveled that far in time and space

08:30.239 --> 08:33.309
I'm a little older when it comes to family here.

08:43.659 --> 08:45.190
Scarier than I imagined

08:46.960 --> 08:49.560
I know I'll be nervous

08:51.399 --> 08:53.670
It's the same here with my mom

08:55.340 --> 08:56.440
with my father..

08:57.399 --> 08:58.909
face to face from time to time

09:00.009 --> 09:01.269
various questions

09:04.749 --> 09:06.409
Is your mind confused?

09:18.229 --> 09:19.690
But that matchbox

09:20.359 --> 09:23.159
I think it's good that I found my dad and not someone else

09:26.300 --> 09:28.268
I wasn't released because of my car.

09:28.269 --> 09:29.600
I think

09:31.409 --> 09:34.440
Although I can't explain it in words

09:35.340 --> 09:38.279
I want to believe your feelings

09:38.909 --> 09:40.580
There will definitely be

09:42.680 --> 09:43.720
I have no idea

09:44.220 --> 09:46.389
The principal also said that he loved her very much

09:47.249 --> 09:48.720
Because some things are attractive

09:50.060 --> 09:52.190
How do I identify this strange man?

09:53.259 --> 09:55.729
I feel the atmosphere of grandson

09:58.170 --> 10:00.029
Even though I know you want to comfort me

10:01.940 --> 10:03.739
I guess I just did something wrong

10:04.909 --> 10:05.939
Well

10:05.940 --> 10:08.080
I feel the atmosphere of grandson

10:09.779 --> 10:13.249
If that's the case,
you'll be disgusted and hated from an early age

10:18.450 --> 10:20.790
Although he is the only family member who comes to accompany him

10:21.249 --> 10:22.920
my life

10:23.590 --> 10:25.659
The person who treats me like I don't exist

10:28.060 --> 10:29.159
How is it going?

10:30.859 --> 10:31.999
I have no idea

10:32.729 --> 10:34.840
I don't know what makes me so upset

10:37.970 --> 10:39.609
But why alone?

10:40.210 --> 10:42.279
Don't you live with your father?

10:45.350 --> 10:48.320
I don’t know if I was shocked after my mother left.

10:48.450 --> 10:50.019
Return to the United States

10:52.850 --> 10:55.759
He went on to school and
became a professor

10:56.420 --> 10:57.960
I've lived there my whole life

10:58.930 --> 11:00.858
Because he only comes back to see me on vacation

11:00.859 --> 11:03.659
I only see him twice a year

11:04.159 --> 11:06.129
Even then, I had to do research

11:07.070 --> 11:09.940
Stayed for a while and then went back

11:12.639 --> 11:14.509
Although he is a kind person

11:15.639 --> 11:18.479
Until I feel like I want to believe when I'm free

11:19.479 --> 11:21.550
I think I don't have enough bonds

11:27.749 --> 11:29.159
Did I say too much?

11:36.229 --> 11:37.629
i will be alone

11:45.009 --> 11:47.470
no one loves Me

11:49.009 --> 11:51.609
The time I thought like this

12:02.090 --> 12:03.790
But you know what?

12:11.129 --> 12:13.070
i have a bond

12:20.340 --> 12:23.279
I think this is how I treat you

12:39.330 --> 12:41.359
the dream i dream

12:44.359 --> 12:46.369
Take a time travel machine

12:47.300 --> 12:48.970
back to the Future

13:09.019 --> 13:13.930
Everything is as I imagined

13:14.359 --> 13:15.629
Miracle

13:16.800 --> 13:18.269
How come you have such good eyes?

13:19.330 --> 13:20.930
everyone seems happy

13:23.639 --> 13:24.800
but..

13:27.670 --> 13:29.779
he's not there

13:30.879 --> 13:32.580
I didn't find much money

13:33.350 --> 13:35.220
You are definitely...

13:36.979 --> 13:38.420
That world doesn't exist

13:40.050 --> 13:41.889
disappeared without a trace

13:43.859 --> 13:47.960
He woke up after searching all this time

13:49.600 --> 13:51.600
This is my nightmare now

13:52.600 --> 13:54.970
Although I think this is a dream of freedom

13:57.170 --> 14:00.609
I'm disgusted and don't want to express it in words

14:02.340 --> 14:04.080
i feel scared and sad

14:08.149 --> 14:09.879
the future without you

14:14.590 --> 14:17.659
I want to have a future with you

14:19.029 --> 14:20.060
There

14:21.060 --> 14:22.930
I will also
take you to a good restaurant I know

14:24.930 --> 14:27.269
We will walk on a new road together

14:29.499 --> 14:30.639
useless

14:31.369 --> 14:35.310
Not scary things, but
lighthearted words

14:38.779 --> 14:41.979
I think I want to do it with you

14:49.420 --> 14:52.690
Is this false comfort?

15:02.769 --> 15:03.769
this time

15:06.210 --> 15:08.840
Should I take that as comfort?

15:18.420 --> 15:19.420
hehe

15:33.729 --> 15:35.998
I thought this was what I expected

15:35.999 --> 15:37.040
such a future

15:41.369 --> 15:43.840
So I pretended not to know until the end

16:12.739 --> 16:15.070
Although we don't have much time

16:17.540 --> 16:18.550
A little while..

16:19.609 --> 16:21.310
They think things have stopped

16:55.009 --> 16:56.079
I'm coming

16:56.080 --> 16:57.979
- I'm
coming

16:59.450 --> 17:01.450
(The trustworthy Wujiang Police Station will always be with the people)

17:05.659 --> 17:06.889
come out

17:06.930 --> 17:08.429
The real culprit?

17:09.060 --> 17:10.729
- Give me a word
- Take it away

17:10.730 --> 17:11.829
- Okay
- go away

17:11.830 --> 17:13.569
- Remove
- Do not push

17:13.570 --> 17:14.899
The real culprit?

17:15.169 --> 17:16.839
Rope found at the scene

17:16.840 --> 17:17.899
The matchbox is out

17:18.040 --> 17:19.168
Why are you jumping to conclusions?

17:19.169 --> 17:20.510
Currently, the suspect is the culprit

17:20.669 --> 17:21.878
If the culprit is most likely

17:21.879 --> 17:22.879
Is that so, Detective Jane?

17:23.040 --> 17:24.780
Did Detective Jane himself catch him?

17:24.980 --> 17:27.379
Although yes

17:27.609 --> 17:28.780
wait

17:28.980 --> 17:32.090
From time to time he wrote articles slandering our battalion commander.

17:32.149 --> 17:33.618
Mom, that's it

17:33.619 --> 17:35.619
Now I have to go to my post as originally planned.

17:35.859 --> 17:37.490
I turned a crisis into an opportunity

17:38.219 --> 17:40.790
- Now, give way.
- Give way.

17:41.899 --> 17:43.959
- Give me a word
- Delete

17:45.469 --> 17:47.230
Well, that's right

17:47.300 --> 17:49.399
Yes, I think it's coming now

17:50.040 --> 17:51.438
- Yes, as soon as possible..
- Sit down

17:51.439 --> 17:52.639
- I'll kill it.
- Sit down.

17:52.840 --> 17:53.869
- Yeah
- sitting here.

17:57.010 --> 17:58.040
Minsu

17:58.810 --> 18:00.149
you are the culprit

18:00.609 --> 18:01.649
This guy

18:02.550 --> 18:03.580
Yes

18:05.649 --> 18:07.590
- Yes
, ma'am.

18:07.750 --> 18:09.958
How much had this guy drank?

18:09.959 --> 18:12.289
Why confess without knowing?

18:12.290 --> 18:15.800
I admit it's just because I drink

18:19.500 --> 18:20.530
Misu

18:23.740 --> 18:26.639
Where is my sister Misu?

18:30.580 --> 18:32.679
Hey, let him sleep first

18:33.649 --> 18:35.449
If you regain consciousness, straighten up immediately

18:35.820 --> 18:37.349
As soon as possible

18:37.350 --> 18:38.378
- Yes
Yes

18:38.379 --> 18:39.449
hey guys

18:39.820 --> 18:41.118
- Be careful, hey
- Mom

18:41.119 --> 18:42.489
I have to go home now

18:42.490 --> 18:44.819
- To
- Miss this person

18:44.820 --> 18:46.230
- leader
- keep

18:47.459 --> 18:48.629
I have something to say

18:51.129 --> 18:53.569
I found the matchbox, but
no news

18:53.570 --> 18:56.369
I'll add the text from there

18:56.800 --> 18:59.638
Isn't the fact that there is an empty match
important?

18:59.639 --> 19:01.609
Prepare in advance

19:03.240 --> 19:04.608
(For better public policing)

19:04.609 --> 19:06.580
I looked at the notebook in Gominsu's room

19:07.679 --> 19:09.019
The handwriting is completely different

19:09.020 --> 19:10.179
Have you taken the exam?

19:10.580 --> 19:12.689
If it were you, would you
write as usual?

19:12.889 --> 19:14.389
I can write the key

19:15.590 --> 19:17.589
This definitely needs to be checked again

19:17.590 --> 19:18.689
Hey badminton number eight

19:19.560 --> 19:20.789
A child saw it with his own eyes

19:20.790 --> 19:22.260
What else should I check?

19:23.260 --> 19:26.129
What idiot would turn his family over to the police if it weren't for you
?

19:28.570 --> 19:31.540
As long as there are reliable witnesses and
evidence

19:31.869 --> 19:33.909
This game is over

19:35.439 --> 19:37.878
I remember it was pretty good before

19:37.879 --> 19:39.250
I have a knockout

19:39.709 --> 19:41.310
I'm short of water

19:42.020 --> 19:43.080
strength

20:01.300 --> 20:02.439
it won't disappear

20:05.240 --> 20:06.369
accused arrested

20:06.939 --> 20:10.179
Your mother and future
definitely saved me

20:10.580 --> 20:11.580
we will go back together

20:18.990 --> 20:20.689
Let's go shopping together for a long time

20:21.119 --> 20:22.119
with me

20:27.830 --> 20:28.830
grandfather

20:29.659 --> 20:30.699
Mother

20:31.159 --> 20:33.199
- Is it dark?
- Mother

20:33.629 --> 20:34.699
grandfather?

20:35.369 --> 20:36.699
I?

20:39.070 --> 20:40.909
Did you get a call from your grandpa?

20:44.580 --> 20:47.080
Okay, I have to go back

20:47.850 --> 20:49.619
I want to enter

20:50.580 --> 20:51.649
moment

20:55.619 --> 20:58.990
Teacher Ho..

21:01.490 --> 21:03.060
we sing

21:05.060 --> 21:06.770
he became a novelist

21:07.869 --> 21:09.770
Really good,
yes

21:10.540 --> 21:12.109
Mom, that's it

21:12.909 --> 21:14.469
this is a big problem

21:15.010 --> 21:16.080
Yes

21:16.879 --> 21:18.280
But good news

21:19.250 --> 21:21.350
Because no one can boast

21:22.520 --> 21:24.320
because people will laugh at

21:25.250 --> 21:27.350
She said
she was not happy about her daughter's death.

21:28.149 --> 21:30.189
But the matter of honor
must be respected

21:31.619 --> 21:34.659
Congratulations, I'm so proud

21:36.100 --> 21:37.260
Thanks

21:38.429 --> 21:41.770
What our second daughter wants to do is
education

21:42.439 --> 21:44.069
I wonder if I should continue teaching

21:44.070 --> 21:45.070
Yes

21:47.510 --> 21:48.609
do it

21:53.780 --> 21:55.050
I want to enter

21:55.409 --> 21:57.449
yes listen

22:04.820 --> 22:05.929
real

22:13.429 --> 22:16.100
(Bangbang Teahouse)

22:30.480 --> 22:32.590
(
Main suspect in serial murder case arrested)

22:32.949 --> 22:34.090
Ge Minsu...

22:38.419 --> 22:41.629
I don’t know if anyone has been arrested yet.

22:42.159 --> 22:43.699
if you have been arrested

22:44.260 --> 22:45.800
difficult to release immediately

22:48.169 --> 22:49.300
police..

22:50.100 --> 22:52.100
no easy way out

22:53.209 --> 22:56.310
Because
the person who reported what he saw was a family member

22:57.840 --> 22:59.449
Who could doubt this?

23:01.310 --> 23:02.750
The real culprit in the end...

23:03.919 --> 23:06.850
I think it will be released only after providing strong evidence.

23:10.419 --> 23:12.928
Gomin Su was murdered
three or four hours before

23:12.929 --> 23:14.159
he was seriously injured

23:15.530 --> 23:16.829
- That's when
- Ms.

23:16.830 --> 23:18.759
- Completely lost
- Broken arm

23:18.760 --> 23:20.929
He reappeared unharmed and
was arrested

23:22.270 --> 23:23.369
- Natalie
- all this stuff.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.240
It’s not enough that Hou Guang planned it himself

23:36.320 --> 23:38.679
Until then, the Gomi Prize Program

23:39.889 --> 23:42.219
That night was a murder

23:43.389 --> 23:46.429
Until Gominsu
hid this situation from others

23:47.760 --> 23:48.959
That's what everything we do means

23:50.429 --> 23:53.270
It must be a very busy night

23:53.570 --> 23:54.669
Five Flavors Award

23:55.840 --> 23:57.369
Not a false witness

23:58.939 --> 24:02.510
It would be nice if real witnesses could come out

24:05.080 --> 24:06.109
This is Kim Hye Yeon

24:08.550 --> 24:09.750
he looks scared

24:10.649 --> 24:13.019
If the Five Flavors novel is true

24:13.020 --> 24:14.590
I'll see something myself

24:17.490 --> 24:19.830
But I don't know
what will be different now

24:20.959 --> 24:22.800
Although I didn’t believe it before

24:23.659 --> 24:26.300
Because I saw that Gomin Su was actually arrested

24:30.169 --> 24:32.669
(Suspect in serial murder case
arrested)

24:38.280 --> 24:39.750
Did you see it by the river?

24:40.810 --> 24:43.350
A red rope is tied around his wrist

24:43.719 --> 24:46.290
Did that third brother
come out of the room?

24:47.090 --> 24:50.060
Some people actually see what they read in the newspapers

24:50.290 --> 24:51.359
kill

24:52.060 --> 24:54.659
- Ha
- I feel bad for Mi Joo.

24:55.090 --> 24:57.429
He also said
it was disgusting and terrible

24:58.330 --> 25:00.368
It's all because of his brother

25:00.369 --> 25:04.340
In fact,
it was not Wuguang, the son of Apaha, who was pitied

25:05.070 --> 25:06.968
He stole San Air's novel

25:06.969 --> 25:09.439
His brother also killed his sister

25:12.310 --> 25:15.049
But I feel sad for Miju

25:15.050 --> 25:16.350
Why pity?

25:28.830 --> 25:30.600
indeed

25:33.899 --> 25:36.600
I didn't say anything, I
just came here to blow some air.

25:38.540 --> 25:41.209
I will come to my mother's shop every time
and sit there for free

25:41.540 --> 25:43.780
I said I know absolutely nothing

25:44.179 --> 25:46.080
Why do you
bother me every now and then?

25:46.350 --> 25:48.409
I know I know I don't ask any more questions

25:48.909 --> 25:50.280
I didn't do this to hurt you

25:51.480 --> 25:52.490
Excellent

25:53.020 --> 25:55.589
If you are afraid of the police,
tell your teacher

25:55.590 --> 25:56.719
one way or another

26:08.330 --> 26:09.399
Mother

26:21.810 --> 26:23.219
Do not talk

26:24.780 --> 26:26.090
I said I'm no longer friends

26:36.760 --> 26:37.830
you..

26:38.600 --> 26:39.899
Are you dating Lee Seung Yeol?

26:40.500 --> 26:41.569
ha

26:41.570 --> 26:42.800
no no

26:44.070 --> 26:45.869
Not because of dissatisfaction

26:53.980 --> 26:55.409
tell me through this

26:57.280 --> 26:58.750
This is Lee Sun Alhara

26:59.320 --> 27:02.119
I want to return it myself,
it was the head teacher who took it.

27:06.159 --> 27:07.159
but..

27:08.790 --> 27:10.530
I don't think he wants to see me

27:17.740 --> 27:19.939
I think I've become a very bad person

27:38.590 --> 27:39.929
from now on

27:41.129 --> 27:42.290
went well

27:43.399 --> 27:45.000
If you don't want to be a worse person

27:47.570 --> 27:48.929
Think this is the last chance

28:03.219 --> 28:04.250
correct

28:45.119 --> 28:46.990
even if you don't send

28:47.629 --> 28:49.129
Why did you receive a class slip?

28:50.699 --> 28:52.000
doctor..

28:52.570 --> 28:54.830
When I was discharged from the hospital, I was told to walk more.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.439
Being alone would be boring

28:59.639 --> 29:00.740
will you go home?

29:01.770 --> 29:02.780
Excellent

29:15.189 --> 29:18.020
So let's come back in a week

29:37.580 --> 29:38.609
Lee Sun El...

29:39.510 --> 29:40.649
Did you go back early?

29:41.780 --> 29:42.820
Excellent

29:43.080 --> 29:44.550
Do you feel this way?

29:45.520 --> 29:46.719
Is my sister dead?

29:49.490 --> 29:51.189
for other family members

29:53.429 --> 29:54.959
accused arrested

29:56.030 --> 29:57.499
demand repayment of debt

29:57.500 --> 29:59.800
Probably the most anticipated one,
right?

30:01.070 --> 30:02.868
But why does this happen?

30:02.869 --> 30:06.139
But
it will be sad

30:07.169 --> 30:08.639
I really don't know anything

30:57.859 --> 30:59.459
Will they last a week?

31:08.000 --> 31:09.300
The school is empty anyway

31:10.000 --> 31:11.369
Did they go away happy?

31:12.570 --> 31:13.770
Are you going to the skating rink?

31:15.040 --> 31:16.109
very good

31:19.709 --> 31:22.310
So are you going to a game store?

31:22.719 --> 31:23.849
Do you know the skeleton game?

31:23.850 --> 31:27.449
Although I feel a little sad because the baby is so cute

31:27.790 --> 31:29.790
But if I do,
I'll feel relieved

31:31.459 --> 31:32.520
let it be

31:38.429 --> 31:39.530
so..

31:41.969 --> 31:43.300
Do I have to give it to you from time to time?

31:44.639 --> 31:46.340
These

31:47.139 --> 31:48.909
- I..
- I'm going home today

31:50.639 --> 31:52.439
our mother alone

31:53.879 --> 31:55.149
I'll go in first

32:07.060 --> 32:09.699
In the morning, after hearing the news of Su Wumin’s arrest,

32:11.760 --> 32:14.500
Our mother
washed the dishes without saying a word

32:15.800 --> 32:17.968
Take out all the dishes

32:17.969 --> 32:20.139
I kept washing until I came out

32:23.679 --> 32:24.980
at present

32:25.879 --> 32:30.480
A bunch of clothes to wash

32:31.419 --> 32:34.990
From my room to Obo's
room

32:36.119 --> 32:38.060
Our mothers are like this too when they are angry

32:40.159 --> 32:41.730
if i miss my mother

32:43.260 --> 32:45.530
sometimes i get worried and scared

32:55.109 --> 32:57.010
So
give me a hug

33:13.290 --> 33:14.389
Mother

33:17.929 --> 33:18.959
Mother

33:19.929 --> 33:21.030
Mother

33:25.070 --> 33:26.240
Mother

33:29.109 --> 33:32.510
i nap till late

33:33.379 --> 33:35.609
I'm hungry

33:36.149 --> 33:37.619
Can I make your favorite topoki?

33:38.080 --> 33:41.790
Oh, the printer sent something

33:41.949 --> 33:43.760
Pre-copy or what?

33:44.520 --> 33:45.858
because of your book

33:45.859 --> 33:48.230
I look a little curious

33:57.840 --> 33:59.639
(Lee Seon-ah's "Small Door")

34:03.409 --> 34:05.139
your sister will love it

34:32.139 --> 34:34.409
- Father
- Yeah

34:34.670 --> 34:38.540
- Mr. Yin..
- Mr. Yin, what's the matter?

34:40.080 --> 34:42.150
We are not villagers

34:43.080 --> 34:45.480
what kind of person?

34:49.089 --> 34:53.429
Oh, what a strange man

34:54.960 --> 34:56.830
What's weird?

34:57.699 --> 34:58.830
So all the time...

35:00.270 --> 35:02.569
I'm saving people

35:03.540 --> 35:04.540
Priest

35:05.339 --> 35:08.440
So the first day we met

35:09.040 --> 35:11.609
Three or four students in our school
inhaled the superglue

35:11.610 --> 35:12.949
Still foamy

35:13.310 --> 35:15.009
A man is about to jump off the cliff

35:15.710 --> 35:18.049
My mother really doesn't want to die

35:18.219 --> 35:21.089
But he suddenly came and
saved me

35:22.719 --> 35:23.759
this is silly

35:24.089 --> 35:27.690
Then one day the village caught fire

35:28.389 --> 35:31.460
Mom, my heart is really

35:32.060 --> 35:34.129
By the way, do you know Uncle Dongshi?

35:34.130 --> 35:35.730
his children are there

35:36.469 --> 35:40.009
But Yin saved me again

35:40.639 --> 35:43.339
this is silly

35:44.139 --> 35:45.810
not only

35:46.650 --> 35:51.049
He suddenly appeared throughout the village,
saved people, and then disappeared again

35:53.520 --> 35:56.289
If you think about it,
to save someone

35:56.290 --> 35:58.219
this is not an easy task

35:58.960 --> 36:00.428
This has been the case from the beginning

36:00.429 --> 36:02.759
It's hard to appear in front of you

36:03.259 --> 36:04.259
Yes or no

36:04.429 --> 36:07.000
So is this weird or stupid?

36:12.440 --> 36:16.139
Weird and stupid

36:18.540 --> 36:20.250
what exactly is it?

36:30.159 --> 36:32.819
As for Kim Hye-yeon,
no matter what she says, she can't get enough help

36:33.489 --> 36:35.289
Because you can't be forced to say it

36:35.290 --> 36:36.699
we have to find another way

36:38.199 --> 36:39.199
Ho...

36:44.170 --> 36:45.239
teacher

36:47.009 --> 36:48.639
well said

37:15.199 --> 37:16.299
for real..

37:17.469 --> 37:19.339
Did it or didn’t say it?

37:21.069 --> 37:22.069
I know

37:25.810 --> 37:29.350
Because I was told to keep it a secret

37:31.819 --> 37:34.489
I want to protect him

37:35.250 --> 37:36.319
is that so

37:38.259 --> 37:39.589
ha

37:40.489 --> 37:43.130
But I no longer know
what is right

37:52.369 --> 37:53.369
this is me

37:56.509 --> 37:57.610
that night

37:58.880 --> 38:02.850
Gomitsu was brought to Gominsu

38:08.250 --> 38:11.020
Isn't there anyone, hey?

38:13.020 --> 38:14.130
There's someone here

38:15.389 --> 38:17.159
save this man

38:19.699 --> 38:20.730
please

38:24.000 --> 38:26.239
Misu's friend?

38:27.339 --> 38:29.210
Please give me a call

38:30.139 --> 38:32.940
My brother is injured

38:33.509 --> 38:35.080
Can't even walk

38:36.110 --> 38:38.520
tell me to call you

38:39.449 --> 38:40.449
please

38:41.949 --> 38:45.420
This madman
really deserves to be killed

38:45.860 --> 38:47.290
Don't come here again

38:48.560 --> 38:50.830
i had to call

38:51.299 --> 38:53.630
Just say I didn't say it

38:54.529 --> 38:56.500
- If you say you don't know...
- It doesn't matter

38:57.100 --> 38:58.400
Stay tuned because it's coming

39:08.580 --> 39:09.819
if you find out later

39:11.219 --> 39:13.020
Mom will hate me

39:17.560 --> 39:20.730
I'm really tired of chasing
that guy, I'm dying

39:22.060 --> 39:23.830
Should I hit that guy?

39:28.100 --> 39:29.169
What

39:29.170 --> 39:31.440
I couldn't walk at all, I could only lie down

39:32.170 --> 39:35.040
Am I going to tear him to pieces now
?

40:00.929 --> 40:02.000
Quiet

40:04.270 --> 40:05.469
not even breathing

40:23.020 --> 40:25.460
impossible

40:27.029 --> 40:28.690
I need a police station, Misu

40:30.730 --> 40:31.960
it won't happen

40:34.100 --> 40:35.699
What a great opportunity!

40:38.869 --> 40:40.409
try to control yourself

40:41.509 --> 40:42.610
Not yet

40:43.279 --> 40:44.839
Are people dead?

40:45.310 --> 40:47.009
He's dead anyway

40:47.909 --> 40:51.020
Can the police come
and revive him?

40:53.020 --> 40:54.020
but also

40:55.319 --> 40:57.190
But you have to grab it, right?

40:57.290 --> 40:58.319
to whom?

41:00.429 --> 41:02.029
Did you see the defendant's face?

41:03.860 --> 41:04.929
Didn't you see?

41:06.799 --> 41:08.230
Did you see that?

41:10.969 --> 41:12.339
Did you see who it was?

41:49.509 --> 41:51.040
Misu

41:58.319 --> 41:59.319
check it out

42:01.719 --> 42:02.719
my brother..

42:04.719 --> 42:07.029
Gominsu did that garbage

42:09.230 --> 42:11.130
Don't let others see
or notice

42:12.460 --> 42:14.330
I chose a place out of sight

42:18.139 --> 42:20.770
I'm afraid that others will see me,
haha

42:27.409 --> 42:29.880
What a disappointment our family is.

42:32.250 --> 42:33.690
I'm for those people

42:34.889 --> 42:36.249
What an insignificant existence

42:36.250 --> 42:38.259
I'm scared that others will notice

42:44.929 --> 42:45.929
hell boy

42:47.429 --> 42:48.730
Please help me

42:51.299 --> 42:53.100
At this point, Gominsu can end

42:54.210 --> 42:56.710
I am confident to complete

42:58.480 --> 42:59.739
but not yet

43:00.509 --> 43:02.909
The real culprit may be caught

43:04.179 --> 43:06.020
How did you do it?

43:12.790 --> 43:14.130
he was not arrested

43:20.330 --> 43:21.569
he was not arrested

43:48.159 --> 43:50.799
(Bangbang Teahouse)

44:22.989 --> 44:24.159
What did Kim Hye Yeon say?

44:27.500 --> 44:28.529
Why?

44:30.839 --> 44:32.369
Not Wuguang

44:34.610 --> 44:36.339
The culprit is not Wuguang

44:37.380 --> 44:38.610
witness

44:39.210 --> 44:40.380
true witness

44:41.650 --> 44:44.750
He just wrote what he saw in the novel

44:46.949 --> 44:48.389
The culprit is a man

44:48.850 --> 44:52.489
The only person who knows that face
is Hou Guang

45:15.409 --> 45:16.409
Yes

45:17.179 --> 45:18.250
teacher

45:20.080 --> 45:21.119
i believe in euben

45:23.860 --> 45:24.860
What’s wrong with you?

45:27.989 --> 45:29.029
teacher

45:34.400 --> 45:36.230
I'm scared

45:39.239 --> 45:40.839
Be sure to say what he said

45:43.069 --> 45:44.339
Sun Al...

45:45.540 --> 45:46.810
Sun Al...

45:48.449 --> 45:49.449
explain

45:51.850 --> 45:52.980
Say it quickly

45:56.989 --> 45:59.790
Anyway, I think
something happened to Son El

46:01.429 --> 46:02.560
what have you found?

46:03.759 --> 46:06.759
When, where and what did you see
?

46:08.670 --> 46:11.039
He came down from school earlier

46:11.040 --> 46:13.040
He climbed up the hill behind the village

46:14.369 --> 46:17.710
The teacher didn't return the ring

46:22.580 --> 46:24.020
(small door)

46:32.860 --> 46:33.960
no no

46:34.860 --> 46:38.029
Because the ashes of the school teacher were scattered there

46:39.130 --> 46:40.330
move there

46:42.199 --> 46:44.069
Sorry, I have to leave

46:46.900 --> 46:50.069
I really experienced it like this

46:50.279 --> 46:51.279
but..

47:03.589 --> 47:04.589
Sun E

47:08.360 --> 47:09.389
Sun E

47:11.330 --> 47:13.259
No need to search extensively

47:13.730 --> 47:14.830
Sun E

47:16.029 --> 47:19.239
I called Shanai's home, but
they haven't come back yet

47:21.440 --> 47:24.380
Even though I called the police

47:28.980 --> 47:31.779
The defendant has been captured and
nothing will happen

47:32.850 --> 47:34.350
Every time you go out

47:38.259 --> 47:39.489
But the teacher

47:41.259 --> 47:42.360
I..

47:42.659 --> 47:45.529
Without further ado, you stay there

47:45.730 --> 47:46.830
I will come

48:01.080 --> 48:02.449
my mother is gone

48:04.949 --> 48:06.319
The last place...

48:06.650 --> 48:08.719
The side of the mountain where Li Jing'e's bones are scattered

48:14.290 --> 48:15.630
you must inform the police

48:16.429 --> 48:18.158
After finding Bahaisu

48:18.159 --> 48:19.860
Go to Baden Detective No. 8 quickly.

48:22.170 --> 48:23.270
Can it be done?

48:34.480 --> 48:35.679
Not versatile enough

49:22.089 --> 49:23.659

49:34.770 --> 49:35.770

49:36.909 --> 49:37.940

49:39.380 --> 49:40.409

49:47.080 --> 49:48.750

49:51.190 --> 49:53.489

50:54.089 --> 50:56.489
Oh my God, why are you here?

50:56.690 --> 50:57.860
Save me, little uncle

50:58.190 --> 50:59.960
I think something fishy is going on

51:01.960 --> 51:03.060

51:06.400 --> 51:07.469
Are you really here?

51:21.210 --> 51:22.250
Sun E

51:26.819 --> 51:27.889
How are you?

51:29.690 --> 51:30.690
Run away quickly

51:31.290 --> 51:32.290
run away

51:32.489 --> 51:33.819
Run away quickly

51:33.860 --> 51:34.929
Hey

51:40.360 --> 51:42.069

mr san el

53:51.630 --> 53:52.699
teacher

53:53.460 --> 53:55.130
The defendant then

54:07.810 --> 54:10.110
Can Su wait here?

54:15.719 --> 54:16.790
Yes

Sun E

55:11.179 --> 55:13.239
I got it

55:16.049 --> 55:18.448
The defendant is Gomin Supa,
what's going on?

55:18.449 --> 55:19.850
nothing happened

55:24.190 --> 55:25.790
Hey hey hey, try to control yourself

55:25.960 --> 55:28.730

55:29.429 --> 55:31.000

Beware_

58:11.790 --> 58:13.319
But the teacher

58:14.889 --> 58:16.130
I..

58:18.600 --> 58:21.799
No matter what, I want to keep searching

58:22.830 --> 58:24.569
help me

58:25.569 --> 58:28.639
earlier in the mountains

58:28.969 --> 58:31.810
I saw the way Sun-e looked at me

58:32.580 --> 58:35.179
looks very scary

58:39.719 --> 58:43.020
I think I've become a very bad person

58:48.290 --> 58:49.589
teacher

58:51.000 --> 58:52.330
in other words..

58:53.259 --> 58:56.830
I don't know if this is my chance

59:31.540 --> 59:33.940
don't move and surrender

59:47.719 --> 59:49.520
Put your hands up and come down, hey

(Bangbang Teahouse)

01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:40.100
(Women who study are more dangerous)

This guy

"A Stranger I Met"

01:02:32.719 --> 01:02:33.719
Who is the culprit?

01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:34.919
Why do you ask me this?

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:36.218
Another person died

01:02:36.219 --> 01:02:38.088
I'm in the same class as you

01:02:38.089 --> 01:02:39.988
A good boy
died in an abandoned house

01:02:39.989 --> 01:02:41.790
Otherwise, Li Cheng'e will be dead.

01:02:42.259 --> 01:02:43.330
come out
