"Perfect Strangers"

00:16.480 --> 00:19.049
"Kim Dong-wook"

00:28.860 --> 00:31.499
"Kim Ki Joo"

00:40.840 --> 00:44.009
"Perfect Strangers"

00:45.709 --> 00:47.248
"In the first few episodes"

00:47.249 --> 00:48.819
Do you remember them?

00:48.950 --> 00:52.420
Two girls who died in succession...

00:52.490 --> 00:54.859
May 14-16, 1987

00:56.690 --> 01:00.490
A woman disappeared on May 20
and is still missing

01:00.690 --> 01:03.432
Due to a letter she left behind,
it is believed she has fled her home

01:03.929 --> 01:04.969
but she died

01:05.300 --> 01:07.258
I'm only telling you what's written here

01:07.740 --> 01:09.800
This is a novel by Gao Meishu.

01:10.039 --> 01:12.809
Anyway, what is written in the novel is that
three women died.

01:13.009 --> 01:15.209
And the culprit was never caught until the end

01:15.380 --> 01:17.280
Do you want to be the killer Gaomeishi?

01:18.709 --> 01:22.280
Do you want to know why the killers in my novels
are all women?

01:22.419 --> 01:25.919
Anyone can commit a crime...

01:26.050 --> 01:29.360
Any woman can commit a brutal crime

01:29.559 --> 01:30.819
I chose the story...

01:31.259 --> 01:34.300
I use it to write novels

01:35.000 --> 01:38.569
Gaomeishi is fully capable of doing this

01:38.600 --> 01:40.699
"Gao Meishu,
Gao Minxiu's sister's witness."

01:45.539 --> 01:49.080
"Perfect Strangers, Episode 10:
Far or Near"

01:49.740 --> 01:51.478
"Episode 10"

01:51.479 --> 01:52.679
"Hotel entrance"

01:55.280 --> 01:56.619
Maybe, some facts...

01:58.190 --> 02:00.619
She is destined to reach her destination

02:03.589 --> 02:05.929
Even if it means
a long time has passed

02:08.059 --> 02:09.759
it reaches the intended person

02:41.630 --> 02:42.930
Do you think you can walk?

02:44.900 --> 02:46.069
Let's go to the hospital

02:49.199 --> 02:50.269
No

02:51.069 --> 02:52.769
I left the hotel alone

02:54.169 --> 02:57.210
It can't be that embarrassing,
I don't deserve treatment

02:59.009 --> 03:00.449
Before my brother leaves...

03:02.350 --> 03:03.680
I'm not going anywhere

03:15.460 --> 03:16.900
maybe that's what you think

03:20.799 --> 03:22.370
Maybe your leg wasn't treated...

03:23.470 --> 03:25.069
when i'm here alone

03:28.039 --> 03:29.310
but not now

03:30.639 --> 03:31.850
I won't let you do this

03:41.389 --> 03:42.789
- Leave me alone
- Be careful

03:48.060 --> 03:51.470
leave me alone

03:52.600 --> 03:54.370
I have to go find my brother

04:09.850 --> 04:12.489
Please take good care of Hee-seop when he comes out

04:15.120 --> 04:16.120
wait

04:18.690 --> 04:20.592
In fact, when they took Baek Hee-seop away...

04:21.400 --> 04:23.059
I immediately called my colleagues

04:24.729 --> 04:27.129
They arrived 50 minutes later.
They're almost there

04:30.917 --> 04:32.548
- Are you sure he's at the hotel?
- OK

04:32.573 --> 04:34.139
- which room?
- Room 204

04:34.140 --> 04:35.978
- Really? which room?
- Room 204

04:35.979 --> 04:37.239
Come on, go to room 204

04:38.950 --> 04:39.950
Damn it

04:40.809 --> 04:42.979
I understand our current situation

04:44.080 --> 04:45.090
but...

04:47.890 --> 04:50.020
No sir, I apologize.

05:08.609 --> 05:09.780
Like I said...

05:10.640 --> 05:12.850
we may not have a good plan

05:14.179 --> 05:16.919
No, people who can't even defeat these people.

05:18.189 --> 05:19.419
someone who might know the future

05:21.689 --> 05:24.460
Reporters from various stations have received the information
and will arrive soon.

05:25.559 --> 05:26.859
15 minutes

05:27.629 --> 05:30.299
Those who know will be over in 15 minutes

05:31.830 --> 05:33.400
You're the only one here who knows this

05:37.970 --> 05:39.410
Rescue your brother first

05:40.010 --> 05:42.148
and wait as long as possible
before your injury worsens

05:42.739 --> 05:45.609
Staying safe only takes 15 minutes

05:47.919 --> 05:49.249
for your family

05:58.260 --> 06:00.460
yes i will do that

06:06.100 --> 06:07.129
let's go out

06:08.770 --> 06:10.100
Have you ever tortured them?

06:10.869 --> 06:12.070
You tortured them, didn't you?

06:14.239 --> 06:15.239
let's get out of here

06:18.309 --> 06:19.966
- answer our questions
- I torture them

06:21.619 --> 06:23.879
-Answer our questions-
You tortured children, right?

06:24.150 --> 06:26.850
Why bring high school students to the dormitory?

06:27.320 --> 06:28.959
- We answer
- Why don't you say something?

06:28.960 --> 06:30.389
- We answer
- Have you ever tortured children?

06:30.390 --> 06:32.159
- Why did you bring them here?
- we answered

06:32.160 --> 06:33.390
- Why?
- we answered

06:41.999 --> 06:43.039
Thank you...

06:43.369 --> 06:46.609
I make the future I know
become reality

06:51.140 --> 06:55.080
"Wozong Hospital"

07:14.939 --> 07:17.039
Have the comrades arrived in Seoul?

07:17.840 --> 07:19.710
they got their purpose

07:20.369 --> 07:23.179
I saw them partying at the bar after get off work

07:24.780 --> 07:26.249
We are in 1987

07:27.280 --> 07:29.150
This can't be
aired on TV

07:30.619 --> 07:32.689
But they still came here

07:33.020 --> 07:36.619
I happen to have direct connections with people who are coming here no matter what

07:38.537 --> 07:42.768
This fiasco must have been carefully planned.

07:43.460 --> 07:46.600
I get it, that's part of the show,
isn't it?

07:47.629 --> 07:48.669
OK

07:49.970 --> 07:50.970
I saw

07:54.470 --> 07:55.809
Very good

07:57.280 --> 07:58.710
This reminds me of when I first joined the company

07:59.809 --> 08:01.520
The world is a crazy place

08:02.650 --> 08:05.890
I worry about whether he can
survive in this cruel world

08:06.319 --> 08:09.189
God, he did more than just survive.

08:10.160 --> 08:11.959
His longest career...

08:11.960 --> 08:13.189
as director of the press department

08:13.359 --> 08:15.999
- The boy who looks like a complete beginner?
- OK

08:16.660 --> 08:17.729
impossible

08:35.280 --> 08:38.090
What future do you think they have?

08:41.489 --> 08:42.859
Amal...

08:44.190 --> 08:46.790
they can start over

08:47.930 --> 08:51.330
After all the pain they've been through...

08:52.570 --> 08:54.629
Hope they can live their own lives...

08:55.540 --> 08:56.840
which one do they want

09:04.279 --> 09:05.479
they will survive

09:08.979 --> 09:10.479
The operation went well

09:11.420 --> 09:13.590
They will all recover and make a full recovery

09:15.060 --> 09:16.889
I'm sure a lot of things have changed

09:19.060 --> 09:20.960
When you come back you should see...

09:21.930 --> 09:23.759
What kind of family is waiting for you at home?

09:33.040 --> 09:35.009
do you know? I want to treat you to a meal

09:36.009 --> 09:37.479
Do you have the money of this era?

09:37.739 --> 09:39.049
you must lend me money

09:39.050 --> 09:40.550
But it will be an invitation at my expense

09:40.710 --> 09:42.080
I'll give it back to you when we get back

09:42.680 --> 09:43.849
Invite me to dinner tomorrow

09:43.850 --> 09:45.489
I would look for an expensive restaurant

09:56.629 --> 09:57.659
"Yo Subbu"

10:03.540 --> 10:04.639
my Lord

10:07.769 --> 10:09.710
what happened?

10:10.210 --> 10:11.760
I haven't been able to contact you for a while

10:12.680 --> 10:14.550
Why do you look so bandaged?

10:28.629 --> 10:30.729
Does that make sense? Let me go

10:31.129 --> 10:32.729
Do you think this makes sense?

10:33.300 --> 10:36.970
How can you let him go without evidence?

10:37.440 --> 10:41.040
You know the truth about what they are

10:41.609 --> 10:43.309
But you didn't tell me

10:43.310 --> 10:45.209
Stop being stupid, you idiot

10:45.210 --> 10:48.679
If you were worried about your nephew,
why did you arrest him and bring him here?

10:48.680 --> 10:49.680
Why did you do this?

10:50.220 --> 10:52.089
What? How could this be different?

10:52.090 --> 10:53.420
Yes, that's right

10:53.749 --> 10:55.618
This will help your assessment if he is a criminal

10:55.619 --> 10:58.089
But as long as there is one dissenter,
this will cause us trouble

10:58.090 --> 11:00.758
He also has precedent, don’t you agree?

11:00.759 --> 11:02.830
- calm down?
- What?

11:03.129 --> 11:05.128
Listen, no matter what...

11:05.129 --> 11:08.498
we do this to make a living

11:08.499 --> 11:10.799
So don't be too exaggerated

11:10.800 --> 11:13.210
we were both embarrassed

11:17.279 --> 11:20.149
- Dong-sik, what's wrong with you?
- What's this?

11:21.409 --> 11:22.420
stop...

11:23.119 --> 11:24.479
The boss is here

11:25.850 --> 11:26.950
Oh my god

11:27.887 --> 11:31.551
We were in a meeting and
kind of lost our cool.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.590
what a shame

11:38.170 --> 11:40.769
Two people have died in the village

11:41.399 --> 11:44.300
I provide you with food and drink every day

11:45.040 --> 11:48.108
The villagers shed painful tears because of the loss of their loved ones...

11:48.109 --> 11:49.579
Yet you are quarreling here

11:49.580 --> 11:51.040
Have you always been a poor person?

11:51.310 --> 11:52.379
I apologize

11:52.450 --> 11:53.479
-I apologize
-I'm sorry

11:54.580 --> 11:56.149
I am disappointed

12:00.389 --> 12:01.744
As for Baek Hee-seop...

12:03.190 --> 12:05.960
Stop being cruel to my students

12:06.489 --> 12:07.560
concept?

12:14.570 --> 12:16.040
screw you

12:16.139 --> 12:19.070
Mr. Yin, wait...

12:20.040 --> 12:21.239
Good day sir

12:22.085 --> 12:23.354
Oh my god

12:23.379 --> 12:24.379
Damn it

12:25.402 --> 12:26.402
OMG

13:06.720 --> 13:08.720
"Better have some sauce on it."

13:09.220 --> 13:10.220
What are you doing there?

13:12.330 --> 13:13.330
What's this?

13:14.359 --> 13:17.330
I have no idea

13:25.570 --> 13:26.609
This is twisted breadsticks

13:29.080 --> 13:31.609
Jing A loves her

13:37.619 --> 13:40.489
Dinner is ready, let's go inside, okay, Ja.

14:02.340 --> 14:04.680
"The Houzongri Murder Suspect"

14:10.950 --> 14:12.519
He is finally back

14:13.290 --> 14:14.349
from?

14:14.350 --> 14:15.420
our heroes

14:24.499 --> 14:25.970
There are two conditions...

14:27.499 --> 14:28.600
I will ask you

14:30.269 --> 14:31.300
Suddenly?

14:31.340 --> 14:33.710
I prefer to have one meal every night

14:34.109 --> 14:36.080
This is grilled cheese

14:36.580 --> 14:39.210
Best to prepare between 8pm and 9pm

14:39.580 --> 14:41.049
The second condition...

14:41.050 --> 14:42.920
Don't disturb me except when I'm eating

14:43.479 --> 14:45.950
I hate when people interrupt me when I'm concentrating

14:48.489 --> 14:49.859
- Yes
- And to start...

14:50.320 --> 14:52.290
You can solve the Rubik's Cube in 5 minutes

15:04.399 --> 15:08.540
Five, four, three, two...

15:17.550 --> 15:19.489
Well, let me help you solve it

15:21.320 --> 15:23.019
You are a complete tyrant, aren't you?

15:23.790 --> 15:26.190
As soon as you open the lid, you'll beg me...

15:26.489 --> 15:28.330
Solve problems for you

15:29.859 --> 15:31.659
I also have two conditions...

15:32.399 --> 15:35.670
First of all, don't talk about what you see here...

15:37.040 --> 15:39.609
to anyone

15:39.940 --> 15:40.970
second...

15:41.470 --> 15:44.340
You can stay in the garage...

15:44.979 --> 15:46.810
So as not to disturb the lady I live with.

15:47.649 --> 15:49.779
Do you set conditions when I do this for free?

15:58.659 --> 15:59.659
What's this?

16:00.029 --> 16:02.659
What? Is it any different from others?

16:06.629 --> 16:08.670
No, I mean the battery...

16:09.639 --> 16:12.340
What? Do you think you can fix it?

16:12.710 --> 16:14.570
Yes, Hyejun.

16:54.979 --> 16:57.149
Now, it's time to fix the machine...

16:58.180 --> 16:59.850
We have to do the best we can here...

17:00.249 --> 17:01.489
before we come back

17:02.460 --> 17:04.159
We will arrest those who need to be arrested...

17:04.590 --> 17:06.359
We criticize those who should be saved

17:08.459 --> 17:10.759
The last victim was in 1987

17:10.760 --> 17:13.515
"Suspect's personal information
: Lee Joo-young, Lee Kyung-ae."

17:16.969 --> 17:18.869
Pick it up and try it out, do you know how to play?

17:19.209 --> 17:21.169
- Okay, I'll play with you
- Try it

17:21.570 --> 17:23.039
Let's start like this

17:23.040 --> 17:24.279
- Awesome
- Did you see that?

17:24.280 --> 17:25.948
Then we make it like this

17:25.949 --> 17:26.949
gosh you

17:27.209 --> 17:28.250
she is here

17:28.480 --> 17:29.550
"He Jing"

17:30.379 --> 17:33.590
Kim Ha Kyung, also
a first-year student in the third grade of middle and high school

17:34.320 --> 17:36.060
We no longer have suspects to examine

17:36.490 --> 17:38.320
But maybe it can be more subtle

17:38.859 --> 17:41.730
This means we can move on without having to...

17:42.060 --> 17:43.760
Our roads cross with the police

17:46.169 --> 17:48.269
We know a suspect...

17:48.270 --> 17:49.300
they don't know him

17:57.568 --> 18:00.078
Don’t you still think Gao Meishi
is one of the suspects?

18:00.649 --> 18:01.964
Just because it's the story she tells?

18:02.280 --> 18:05.179
The only one who claims
Kim Ha Kyung is the victim...

18:05.490 --> 18:07.790
But there's nothing concrete in her account

18:08.149 --> 18:09.959
Did Gao Meishu tell you anything...

18:10.060 --> 18:11.219
About Kim Ha Kyung?

18:12.990 --> 18:14.030
indeed

18:16.330 --> 18:18.600
How would she write about the third victim?

18:19.570 --> 18:20.600
you told me

18:23.340 --> 18:25.070
I am on a diet

18:25.969 --> 18:26.969
you gained weight

18:27.336 --> 18:29.280
- No, you lost weight.
- You even gained weight.

18:29.639 --> 18:30.709
please

18:32.780 --> 18:33.879
she says...

18:34.909 --> 18:36.320
Kim Ha Kyung...

18:37.619 --> 18:38.619
you are here

18:38.689 --> 18:40.290
She likes the writer
Gao Meishu very much.

18:40.889 --> 18:41.889
welcome

18:42.219 --> 18:43.520
“Takami Shu”...

18:44.159 --> 18:45.889
I know this too

18:45.959 --> 18:48.060
Listen, since we're here, I'm telling you

18:48.600 --> 18:51.399
- Okay
- What are you going to do?

18:52.000 --> 18:53.330
surprise

18:55.000 --> 18:56.968
My mother is working

18:56.969 --> 18:59.070
For every tape she hangs, they pay her for two years

18:59.439 --> 19:01.909
But they
sell headband gags for $3

19:02.010 --> 19:03.439
But isn’t that theft?

19:03.810 --> 19:06.779
So I stole some...

19:06.780 --> 19:08.209
in order to wear it

19:09.020 --> 19:11.750
Are you crazy?
Why do we all wear the same headbands?

19:12.149 --> 19:13.149
this is corny

19:20.859 --> 19:21.859
How do I look?

19:22.629 --> 19:23.629
Isn't she beautiful?

19:26.369 --> 19:30.369
Mi Sook, you made the headband
look like you spent $9

19:30.469 --> 19:31.600
I will wear it too

19:35.379 --> 19:36.651
you must have another one

19:39.679 --> 19:40.679
I want one

19:40.680 --> 19:42.879
Of course I brought you a copy

19:44.050 --> 19:45.320
You are beautiful

19:48.520 --> 19:50.119
- "Chung Ah"
- "Chung Ah"

19:52.839 --> 19:56.167
- How do you look? Doesn’t it look like 10 yuan?
- No, it looks like a dollar.

19:57.159 --> 19:58.230
you gained weight

20:00.369 --> 20:01.429
can we talk?

20:06.270 --> 20:08.810
What are you going to do now?

20:10.010 --> 20:11.010
about what?

20:13.010 --> 20:16.480
It seems Baek Hee-seop has been released

20:19.919 --> 20:21.250
this is the best

20:23.760 --> 20:25.790
Why didn't he listen to me when I told him not to be angry?

20:27.359 --> 20:28.699
He just doesn't listen to me

20:32.969 --> 20:34.730
I thought he was angry...

20:35.869 --> 20:37.669
Because his brother is not good

20:38.909 --> 20:40.740
So I just wanted to lie to him...

20:41.540 --> 20:43.409
But he was turned away

20:43.679 --> 20:45.649
but i think this is the best

20:47.409 --> 20:49.050
he gave us some time

20:50.820 --> 20:52.649
They are not fully healed yet

20:54.389 --> 20:55.389
his hand

20:56.919 --> 20:59.060
Meixi's friends

21:01.060 --> 21:02.129
Can you...

21:02.760 --> 21:04.500
Can you contact her? please

21:04.803 --> 21:06.330
Tell her I'm hurt

21:07.429 --> 21:08.469
Do...

21:10.969 --> 21:12.709
Stoutin...

21:13.669 --> 21:14.909
Is he really your brother?

21:17.439 --> 21:18.949
Why do you ask again?

21:19.949 --> 21:21.080
this is annoying

21:25.990 --> 21:29.419
Ha Kyung knew her secret and
kept pinching her

21:29.919 --> 21:31.290
This made her very angry

21:31.919 --> 21:33.589
Ha Kyung even ran away from home

21:33.590 --> 21:35.129
she did run away

21:36.560 --> 21:38.829
She also left a handwritten note

21:38.830 --> 21:40.270
"The people you killed"

21:41.330 --> 21:44.169
She became so bold that she left home

21:44.669 --> 21:47.740
She tells Mi-seok that she will reveal her secret…

21:48.070 --> 21:50.539
If you don't come to Seoul with her

21:50.540 --> 21:54.149
The secret is that she is the murderer?

21:54.810 --> 21:55.820
OK

21:59.219 --> 22:00.990
Let us also consider this story

22:02.260 --> 22:03.419
"return"?

22:03.790 --> 22:05.560
There's a story I just discovered

22:07.389 --> 22:09.030
The reason why Ha Kyung ran away from home

22:09.800 --> 22:11.698
We should celebrate such a happy day

22:11.699 --> 22:13.829
- Yes
- Congratulations

22:13.830 --> 22:15.800
- Let's celebrate
- Yes, be happy

22:18.240 --> 22:19.240
School teacher?

22:20.070 --> 22:21.310
Are you talking about my instructor?

22:22.909 --> 22:24.280
What does it have to do with this story?

22:28.679 --> 22:31.480
He has feelings for Ha Kyung's mother.

22:32.350 --> 22:33.889
She is also interested in him

22:37.119 --> 22:39.129
- Madam, here
- Madam

22:39.287 --> 22:41.329
- Two more glasses of juice.
- More juice?

22:41.330 --> 22:42.928
- Yes
- I'll give you more

22:42.929 --> 22:45.198
How are you doing at work these days?

22:45.199 --> 22:47.428
- Come on
- What are you doing?

22:47.429 --> 22:49.668
- Stop moving.
- Please, why are you doing this?

22:49.669 --> 22:50.770
stop

22:51.399 --> 22:53.638
- What?
- what is that?

22:53.639 --> 22:55.070
- What?
- What did you say?

22:57.709 --> 22:59.079
Has he lost his mind?

22:59.080 --> 23:00.908
- no
- leave me

23:00.909 --> 23:03.250
- stay away from me
- calm down

23:06.290 --> 23:08.020
calm down

23:08.250 --> 23:11.760
You are a teacher, how could you do this to my husband?

23:11.859 --> 23:13.060
let me apologize to him

23:13.330 --> 23:14.729
I'll pay for the medicine

23:14.730 --> 23:17.429
Will you leave before Ha Kyung comes back?

23:17.760 --> 23:21.000
Would you be embarrassed to at least meet your daughter?

23:21.800 --> 23:23.300
You're messing with her teacher

23:24.070 --> 23:25.469
watch what you say

23:26.169 --> 23:27.509
She doesn't deserve to hear this

23:27.611 --> 23:30.810
let's go home, mom

23:31.540 --> 23:32.649
let's go

23:34.649 --> 23:35.719
Oh my god

23:57.040 --> 23:58.169
How long have you been standing there?

23:58.969 --> 23:59.969
Have you had dinner?

24:04.480 --> 24:06.750
Drinking soup again?
It's not even on our menu

24:07.649 --> 24:09.020
This is his favorite

24:11.619 --> 24:14.149
I want seaweed soup

24:14.649 --> 24:15.659
What?

24:16.659 --> 24:18.560
Okay, I'll go tomorrow

24:19.290 --> 24:20.429
Just seaweed soup

24:21.189 --> 24:24.600
If I make kimchi soup again,
I won't go home

24:32.040 --> 24:34.939
Does she mean she's leaving the house tomorrow because of kimchi soup?

24:36.879 --> 24:38.010
some

24:41.550 --> 24:43.433
So, Ha Kyung likes seaweed soup

24:43.649 --> 24:45.350
My teacher loves kimchi soup.

24:45.419 --> 24:48.590
But because her mother chose
to make kimchi soup...

24:48.719 --> 24:51.389
This is Ha Kyung’s problem.

24:52.189 --> 24:54.629
In fact, she also does it for her daughter

24:55.290 --> 24:59.169
I made soup last time
and told him not to come again.

25:03.139 --> 25:06.540
What matters to us is what she did after she left home,
right?

25:06.709 --> 25:08.109
That's not why she ran away

25:08.419 --> 25:09.818
This was important in the past

25:10.650 --> 25:12.949
Because we think it's important...

25:13.209 --> 25:15.179
When and where did you meet the perpetrator?

25:16.520 --> 25:17.520
but now...

25:18.419 --> 25:21.119
I don't want to leave room for any other possibility...

25:22.219 --> 25:25.219
Let you never run away no matter what changes happen

25:25.459 --> 25:26.530
but...

25:27.359 --> 25:30.398
This may be our last chance to find the culprit

25:30.399 --> 25:31.859
There must be another way

25:34.330 --> 25:35.369
before that...

25:36.040 --> 25:38.639
let's make sure we keep her alive

25:42.070 --> 25:44.080
"The people you killed"

25:46.480 --> 25:47.850
If the reason is understandable...

25:48.709 --> 25:50.980
She changes her mind easily and leaves home

25:51.850 --> 25:54.090
"Your mother likes you better than your teacher."

25:55.689 --> 25:57.474
"This is kelp soup,
not kimchi."

25:58.119 --> 26:00.159
We just need to let her know the truth

26:06.869 --> 26:10.161
“Let us achieve national harmony through aid,
self-reliance and cooperation.”

26:11.070 --> 26:14.840
"Forward with our independence, creativity and intelligence"

26:22.010 --> 26:24.678
- Does it look good on you?
- Really? Do you think so?

26:24.679 --> 26:26.490
Are they the fourth princess?

26:28.189 --> 26:29.807
Why are they wearing similar headbands?

26:30.060 --> 26:32.130
It's also tacky pink

26:37.000 --> 26:38.260
Does she like pink?

26:39.830 --> 26:42.800
Are you a monk or something?

26:44.093 --> 26:45.933
Are you just comparing me to this? Oh my god

26:46.340 --> 26:48.939
I mean, how could a handsome guy understand that?

27:05.619 --> 27:08.330
Are you proposing today?

27:09.159 --> 27:12.260
Yes, today is a good day

27:13.230 --> 27:14.770
Are you being too optimistic?

27:15.941 --> 27:17.701
Don't you think you might be rejected?

27:18.300 --> 27:21.709
No, I'll make sure you don't say no

27:24.939 --> 27:26.179
you must have heard of it

27:26.949 --> 27:28.409
People are talking about her...

27:28.780 --> 27:30.919
Just because she runs a bar by herself

27:32.320 --> 27:34.590
People talk about her more because of her relationship with me

27:36.689 --> 27:38.320
The problem is I can't hide how I feel

27:41.429 --> 27:44.300
I'm going to put an end to the rumors now.

27:45.699 --> 27:48.070
I will provide them with help and support...

27:49.270 --> 27:51.600
Let people stop talking about
mother and daughter

28:08.490 --> 28:09.490
welcome

28:11.219 --> 28:12.290
Oh my god

28:13.830 --> 28:17.359
When will he wake up?

28:17.899 --> 28:20.669
Look at his clothes. Does it look like chalk?

28:22.129 --> 28:25.070
I heard he got into a fight with one of his parents at the bar yesterday

28:25.699 --> 28:26.839
He's dating a student's mother...

28:26.840 --> 28:28.770
He had a fight with another father

28:30.280 --> 28:31.280
Oh my god

28:31.909 --> 28:33.909
Should I fire him?

28:35.080 --> 28:37.149
You always say that, but you don't deny him

28:38.719 --> 28:39.719
OK

28:40.820 --> 28:43.419
How can you kick your family out, right?

28:46.790 --> 28:47.830
OK

29:09.350 --> 29:12.020
I heard your father was insulted yesterday

29:12.590 --> 29:15.418
Is there a relationship between your father and Ha Kyung’s mother?

29:15.419 --> 29:17.159
Shut up, what if Ha Kyung hears it?

29:18.219 --> 29:19.530
I went to the canteen

29:19.659 --> 29:21.230
you have to be careful

29:21.530 --> 29:23.230
her mother is beautiful

29:24.230 --> 29:25.300
Do you want a piece of me?

29:25.899 --> 29:29.129
You know Ha Kyung's mother and our teacher
are topics of conversation

29:29.500 --> 29:30.840
Doesn't she feel ashamed?

29:31.070 --> 29:32.668
After fooling all these guys...

29:32.669 --> 29:34.839
She also dealt with her daughter's teacher

29:34.840 --> 29:35.909
What?

29:36.080 --> 29:37.080
Oh my god

29:37.081 --> 29:38.810
Can't you live without a man?

29:46.189 --> 29:48.050
- Shut up
- That's enough

29:51.389 --> 29:52.459
It's okay, sit down

29:55.760 --> 29:56.929
Page 58

30:11.840 --> 30:13.280
- oh my god
- oh my god

30:14.850 --> 30:17.320
Have you ever seen my mother with men?

30:17.480 --> 30:19.079
How can this be?

30:19.080 --> 30:20.689
how could I know?

30:20.949 --> 30:23.060
but i saw

30:23.820 --> 30:24.889
"Kim Ha Kyung"

30:25.219 --> 30:26.260
you...

30:27.560 --> 30:28.590
stop

30:29.429 --> 30:31.030
- stop
- stay away from me

30:31.230 --> 30:33.230
- Come here
- Stop, Ha Kyung!

30:33.969 --> 30:35.770
For your mother, you must be strong

30:37.800 --> 30:40.439
This is none of your business, stay out of it

30:40.570 --> 30:44.209
You're a teacher
and can date a bar owner like my mom

30:44.540 --> 30:45.580
You damn thing

31:02.959 --> 31:04.000
- Ha Kyung
- Oh my god

31:12.070 --> 31:13.139
I will be right back

31:20.080 --> 31:21.379
No

31:23.780 --> 31:27.189
"gallery"

31:32.260 --> 31:35.530
"Stella"

32:05.219 --> 32:06.659
No, go back

32:08.429 --> 32:09.459
What?

32:10.260 --> 32:12.459
back inside

32:17.800 --> 32:20.510
You left a message for your mother, right?

32:22.209 --> 32:24.139
how do you know?

32:24.240 --> 32:25.609
look at yourself

32:26.179 --> 32:28.580
This is
what runaway kids do

32:29.550 --> 32:30.949
Go back inside and get it

32:33.820 --> 32:34.990
Should I go in and get it?

32:38.159 --> 32:39.530
Oh my God, come on

32:42.689 --> 32:46.830
"Mom, I really hate that you're my mother."

32:47.429 --> 32:49.011
"I know you feel the same way."

32:49.300 --> 32:51.800
"So, until death, we can't meet again."

32:52.169 --> 32:55.609
- Let's break up.
- Stop reading that.

32:56.139 --> 32:58.080
I only read it nine times

32:58.740 --> 33:00.179
If you did leave this message...

33:00.409 --> 33:03.448
Your mother will definitely read it a thousand times

33:03.449 --> 33:05.178
This will break her heart

33:05.179 --> 33:07.290
What? Still can’t stand it after 9 times?

33:09.219 --> 33:10.590
where are we going?

33:14.230 --> 33:16.429
I know you are not at home now

33:16.959 --> 33:18.429
I ran away from home

33:18.929 --> 33:20.629
you at least need some fresh air

33:23.570 --> 33:24.639
He's here

33:26.869 --> 33:27.869
Get on the bus

33:54.270 --> 33:55.270
my Lord

33:59.240 --> 34:00.270
my Lord

34:01.439 --> 34:02.510
OK

34:04.179 --> 34:06.709
Can you go out early today?

34:07.250 --> 34:09.350
- You have to...
- Of course, go

34:12.319 --> 34:13.389
Thanks

34:25.929 --> 34:27.000
sit down

34:30.270 --> 34:32.069
This is a one-day field trip

34:32.869 --> 34:34.509
We'll keep an eye on this 300-year-old tree

34:40.909 --> 34:42.610
It's just a stupid tree

34:43.880 --> 34:46.549
Do you know what 300 years means?

34:48.920 --> 34:51.989
There must have been droughts and floods

34:53.190 --> 34:57.630
But she still stayed
where she was and was not drawn into the water...

34:58.060 --> 34:59.130
300 years

35:00.069 --> 35:02.529
All trees are like this

35:04.069 --> 35:05.100
nature

35:06.270 --> 35:07.639
The tree has no choice

35:10.210 --> 35:11.779
But why do you think people do this?

35:15.779 --> 35:16.920
I know someone...

35:18.679 --> 35:20.420
He lives like this tree

35:29.230 --> 35:32.298
“August 2013”

35:32.299 --> 35:33.469
"Help me find my daughter"

35:35.869 --> 35:37.040
Thanks

35:38.770 --> 35:39.810
Thanks

35:47.080 --> 35:48.150
OK

35:48.779 --> 35:52.219
- I took this...
- Thank you for taking it.

35:52.250 --> 35:54.219
- Thank you
- Welcome

36:02.029 --> 36:05.299
“December 2015”

36:10.839 --> 36:14.940
- OK
, thanks

36:17.909 --> 36:19.479
“August 2020”

36:19.480 --> 36:21.778
- Thank you, Ha Joon.
- Thank you for the food.

36:21.779 --> 36:22.880
I went shopping again

36:28.920 --> 36:30.759
"Name: (Kim Ha Kyung)"

36:48.170 --> 36:51.540
"October 2020"

36:55.250 --> 36:56.920
God no

37:00.520 --> 37:01.619
Madam, are you okay?

37:02.164 --> 37:03.319
- Please stand up.
- Oh my God.

37:08.690 --> 37:09.799
Thanks

37:15.469 --> 37:18.000
Are you sure you don't want to go to the hospital?

37:18.639 --> 37:20.210
God I'm fine

37:21.940 --> 37:23.380
Thanks

37:24.080 --> 37:26.380
However, you should rest

37:28.679 --> 37:29.880
what if...

37:31.750 --> 37:35.089
My daughter came back while I was resting?

37:36.219 --> 37:38.460
What if she hears me here...

37:38.659 --> 37:40.759
She actually came to see me?

37:41.989 --> 37:45.499
If she can't find me, she'll be disappointed and leave

37:45.500 --> 37:46.799
Then what should I do?

37:47.969 --> 37:51.670
People told me she might be dead

37:54.409 --> 37:56.409
but i don't believe it

37:57.509 --> 37:58.509
I...

37:59.810 --> 38:02.210
I trust the message you left...

38:04.049 --> 38:05.380
for me to read

38:06.949 --> 38:11.719
She wrote this letter because she hates me
and I'm a bad mother

38:12.819 --> 38:17.330
So I think she is avoiding me

38:20.699 --> 38:23.000
I hope so

38:24.339 --> 38:27.369
I want her to live her own life

38:29.369 --> 38:30.810
But I just hope...

38:32.610 --> 38:37.580
I can see it once before I die

38:38.650 --> 38:42.389
I don't want anything, just want to see her

38:44.460 --> 38:46.096
I want to say I'm not good...

38:47.159 --> 38:48.659
I regret

38:50.730 --> 38:51.759
but I...

38:53.170 --> 38:56.600
I miss her...

38:58.400 --> 39:00.440
a lot of

39:14.750 --> 39:16.319
She's been doing this for 40 years

39:18.089 --> 39:22.259
The same place, in the rain and snow

39:23.429 --> 39:25.029
then she died

39:27.529 --> 39:30.069
But in the end she still couldn't see her daughter

39:31.369 --> 39:34.139
I'll only disappear for a while,
not forty years

39:35.339 --> 39:37.710
I know this, so...

39:38.980 --> 39:41.279
Why did you run away from home?

39:41.710 --> 39:43.580
Didn't you quarrel with that girl because of your mother?

39:44.480 --> 39:46.249
You should hate those who spread rumors about her

39:46.250 --> 39:48.350
Why do you want to go against your mother too?

39:49.089 --> 39:50.319
You don't even hate your mother

39:59.799 --> 40:00.869
"Sun A"

40:05.469 --> 40:06.540
"Eunying"

40:11.480 --> 40:12.940
what are you doing here?

40:14.009 --> 40:15.110
What about school?

40:15.909 --> 40:18.319
I left early because I knew you would

40:19.619 --> 40:20.619
Have you eaten yet?

40:24.889 --> 40:25.920
I am fine

40:29.589 --> 40:31.330
Is there no one at home?

40:32.400 --> 40:35.000
Yes, where did your parents go?

40:36.529 --> 40:38.270
go to police station

40:39.139 --> 40:40.509
To take away my sister's body

40:42.310 --> 40:43.940
We should have a funeral for her

40:44.940 --> 40:46.509
But the police are delaying the matter

40:57.290 --> 41:01.060
"Baek Hee-seop" has been released

41:09.069 --> 41:10.239
Where is he now?

41:14.139 --> 41:15.139
What is he doing?

41:17.710 --> 41:18.909
Are you hurt?

41:22.710 --> 41:23.719
Do you want to see him?

41:40.429 --> 41:43.839
"elevator"

42:12.000 --> 42:13.699
Why did you come?

42:16.069 --> 42:18.239
I just want to show you my sweet side

42:18.639 --> 42:20.210
you must respect my property

42:21.009 --> 42:22.369
you mean your privacy

42:25.739 --> 42:27.449
That's because I hurt my head

42:29.409 --> 42:30.819
Why don't you tell them?

42:31.750 --> 42:34.920
If you tell them you're with me,
you won't be dragged away

42:36.760 --> 42:39.030
God, that's yours

42:42.889 --> 42:45.000
i mean your privacy

42:45.699 --> 42:46.869
You idiot

42:48.824 --> 42:50.853
You don't even remember what you just said

43:12.719 --> 43:13.759
"Sun A"

43:17.259 --> 43:18.560
You didn't agree...

43:19.699 --> 43:21.230
which error

43:24.400 --> 43:26.170
When you lose someone you love...

43:27.440 --> 43:28.610
You tend to think so

43:31.110 --> 43:33.110
Wouldn't things be different if I did that?

43:34.980 --> 43:36.509
What if I did?

43:40.850 --> 43:42.219
Because I think it's all your fault

43:46.889 --> 43:49.330
but it is not the truth

43:51.159 --> 43:53.869
You didn't do anything wrong that night

43:55.299 --> 43:56.799
I saw it with my own eyes

43:58.040 --> 43:59.239
you didn't do anything wrong

44:46.750 --> 44:51.719
"Stella"

45:04.239 --> 45:05.400
Come on, come in

45:06.369 --> 45:08.839
Come in and see what I have prepared for you

45:24.276 --> 45:25.975
Hello dear, I'm back

45:26.460 --> 45:27.589
You haven't eaten yet?

45:28.029 --> 45:29.429
I prepared seaweed soup for you

45:30.730 --> 45:31.759
come over

45:32.529 --> 45:33.699
sit down and eat this

45:39.170 --> 45:42.670
I don’t know if this seasoning is good or not.

45:45.639 --> 45:46.810
OK

45:48.850 --> 45:50.080
Help yourself

45:57.860 --> 45:59.960
I thought you made kimchi soup.

46:00.929 --> 46:01.960
What?

46:02.330 --> 46:05.029
I also prepared this

46:06.060 --> 46:07.270
but he didn't come

46:08.500 --> 46:09.569
he won't come again

46:10.130 --> 46:12.639
I was going to tell him not to come here again

46:13.100 --> 46:14.139
I was serious

46:15.509 --> 46:17.440
I wanted to tell him that day

46:19.310 --> 46:20.710
But he said he wouldn't come

46:24.619 --> 46:25.679
presentable

46:27.420 --> 46:29.589
I only want you in my life

46:32.259 --> 46:34.790
Even if you don’t run away from home now...

46:35.460 --> 46:37.259
One day you will be separated from your mother

46:39.230 --> 46:41.599
Go to college at the age of 20 and live on your own

46:41.600 --> 46:43.600
You date a man and get a job

46:46.040 --> 46:48.839
When you look back,
you will realize how much your mother has aged

46:49.969 --> 46:51.509
She will still wait for you to come home

46:52.139 --> 46:53.705
Wouldn't that be difficult to deal with?

46:57.950 --> 47:00.889
Things she doesn’t like when she’s around…

47:01.949 --> 47:04.659
It would be a pity if the distance is too far...

47:06.319 --> 47:07.659
after time passes

47:10.759 --> 47:11.830
That's how it is

47:13.600 --> 47:15.069
Is it because of me that he stopped coming?

47:17.469 --> 47:20.138
He hit me in the face at noon

47:20.139 --> 47:21.339
That bastard

47:21.869 --> 47:24.310
I said something bad about you

47:26.080 --> 47:27.509
That's why he can't come

47:34.650 --> 47:36.089
tell him to come

47:37.989 --> 47:41.589
To be honest, I don’t like seaweed soup

47:52.500 --> 47:53.500
Kelly

48:00.949 --> 48:02.980
- Okay?
- OK

48:08.049 --> 48:10.020
"Stella"

48:14.389 --> 48:17.629
"Martial Arts Market"

48:17.630 --> 48:19.230
Maybe for some facts...

48:20.929 --> 48:23.500
nice to visit

48:25.400 --> 48:27.969
even if it takes a long time

48:29.569 --> 48:31.940
People who want the truth will tell it

48:34.949 --> 48:36.281
Well, there's something...

48:37.650 --> 48:39.920
I couldn't understand him well around my mother.

48:40.920 --> 48:43.218
She says she hates my father
, but every birthday

48:43.219 --> 48:44.759
She is preparing a feast for him

48:45.060 --> 48:46.790
She'll be upset if I don't come

48:47.360 --> 48:48.829
I've always wondered...

48:48.830 --> 48:51.259
Why don't you let him go?

48:54.500 --> 48:56.029
But after what I saw today...

48:57.000 --> 48:58.139
I kind of understand

49:01.440 --> 49:03.170
If anyone were around her...

49:05.009 --> 49:07.350
in her darkest period

49:17.790 --> 49:19.871
See how an eel only costs $2?

49:21.974 --> 49:24.384
When you return your money to me you must take into account price changes

49:25.860 --> 49:26.860
take it

49:30.940 --> 49:33.603
We have to go to a better place.
I want to invite you to some more expensive places

49:35.170 --> 49:38.040
Maybe next
time we come back you can treat me to dinner

49:39.679 --> 49:40.710
really

49:41.549 --> 49:43.179
I know a good restaurant

49:45.049 --> 49:46.819
Let's meet there next time

49:48.819 --> 49:50.960
But I don't go to any restaurants

49:54.159 --> 49:55.259
I expect

49:56.429 --> 50:00.360
I know what it's like to be a strict person who
doesn't even like salty or sweet things

50:01.869 --> 50:03.107
Healthy and Moderate Food

50:03.400 --> 50:05.903
Good ingredients involved

50:05.931 --> 50:07.641
Those bad things are expensive

50:07.869 --> 50:08.940
correct

50:10.170 --> 50:11.310
you know me

50:13.339 --> 50:16.679
Be patient with me and wait for me for 34 years

50:21.520 --> 50:24.119
This is grilled eel

50:24.619 --> 50:25.920
Thanks

50:29.830 --> 50:32.330
Well, give it a try

50:33.299 --> 50:34.999
it's spicy, salty and sweet

50:35.000 --> 50:36.569
This dish is near your home

50:50.980 --> 50:52.480
Really good

50:52.580 --> 50:53.580
enjoy

50:56.420 --> 50:58.860
Want to give it a try? Don't you want that?

50:59.190 --> 51:00.190
You're not going to eat it, right?

51:04.060 --> 51:05.060
Then I'll eat it alone

51:05.061 --> 51:07.130
"Martial Arts Market"

51:31.790 --> 51:33.489
Be careful, you may fall

51:35.489 --> 51:36.960
It's so refreshing

51:38.060 --> 51:40.299
This is what I love about the countryside

51:43.699 --> 51:45.170
Okay, you have to get out now

51:48.670 --> 51:49.670
No

51:59.020 --> 52:00.380
- No
- Oh my God.

52:08.690 --> 52:11.860
Did you see it? My sense of balance?

52:15.270 --> 52:17.170
Yeah, so get out now

52:17.839 --> 52:20.000
If you fall, your head will be broken

52:20.100 --> 52:22.170
Isn't once enough?

52:25.080 --> 52:27.580
Can you share a little bit with me?
feels good

52:28.710 --> 52:30.650
it's out of the question

52:31.779 --> 52:33.650
Come on, just once

52:35.989 --> 52:36.989
No

53:06.779 --> 53:07.850
Why don't you come?

53:08.589 --> 53:09.619
I do not like this

53:17.759 --> 53:18.929
please

53:30.610 --> 53:32.080
Don't say you want to sleep now

53:34.110 --> 53:35.110
Sudden?

53:40.380 --> 53:41.489
OMG

53:46.219 --> 53:47.560
You do not care

53:49.730 --> 53:51.330
you are always cold and heartless

53:53.199 --> 53:54.799
I know...

53:55.109 --> 53:58.408
Now that I said I'd feel better if I disappeared

54:11.619 --> 54:12.779
this makes me upset

54:21.330 --> 54:22.790
this is a problem

54:43.080 --> 54:48.319
"Safety first, safety always"

54:59.330 --> 55:00.600
Sorry I'm late

55:01.670 --> 55:03.929
Some people like water very much

55:13.040 --> 55:15.650
You scared me to death. When did you come?

55:16.350 --> 55:18.020
I knocked on the door,
have some of this

55:20.750 --> 55:21.819
Thanks

55:30.659 --> 55:31.659
what time is it?

55:33.199 --> 55:34.230
It's ten o'clock in the evening

55:35.162 --> 55:36.292
What? Ten p.m?

55:37.469 --> 55:39.839
Damn it, the movie starts at 9:30,
oh my god

55:41.839 --> 55:42.839
"Movie"?

55:42.840 --> 55:45.409
Yes, what's his name?
"The Sweet Days of Our Youth"

55:46.739 --> 55:47.980
Where did you put it?

55:48.080 --> 55:50.980
Oh my God, you told me not to be late, I have to leave

55:56.719 --> 56:00.259
"2020"

56:03.290 --> 56:05.060
Have you collected all these things?

56:05.500 --> 56:06.600
this is only...

56:07.600 --> 56:10.670
Tickets for the movie I watch during my reservation

56:11.900 --> 56:13.100
I keep it as a memory

56:14.509 --> 56:15.610
With your mother?

56:18.639 --> 56:19.679
OK

56:22.650 --> 56:25.279
What was the first movie we watched together?

56:26.819 --> 56:28.650
"The Sweet Days of Our Youth"

56:29.089 --> 56:30.819
But I fell asleep
and couldn't watch it

56:30.989 --> 56:32.759
I always fall asleep while watching movies

56:37.159 --> 56:39.400
"A ticket"

56:55.650 --> 57:00.250
"Wuzong Cinema"

57:01.319 --> 57:02.949
Why did you come...

57:04.290 --> 57:05.318
to here?

57:05.319 --> 57:07.360
"The Sweet Days of Our Youth"

57:37.889 --> 57:40.929
What would I do if I saw her?

57:41.489 --> 57:43.589
What’s the point of knowing who you are now?

58:08.489 --> 58:10.250
What does she look like?

58:11.960 --> 58:13.059
my mom

58:13.060 --> 58:14.588
《1994》

58:14.589 --> 58:18.960
Grandpa, what does my mother look like?

58:21.670 --> 58:24.639
Your mother left the village the day she gave birth to you.

58:25.199 --> 58:27.499
You were crying very sadly...

58:27.500 --> 58:28.540
But she...

58:29.810 --> 58:31.839
She left without even hugging you

58:33.580 --> 58:36.580
She thinks you are a mistake in her life

58:36.710 --> 58:39.779
So from now on don't be curious about it and
don't think about it

58:45.776 --> 58:47.213
- That was a great movie
- Yeah.

58:47.659 --> 58:49.730
- Yes or no?
- OK

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:07.639
Some facts...

01:00:08.369 --> 01:00:10.940
finally reach destination

01:00:26.719 --> 01:00:28.960
no matter what is needed

01:00:29.790 --> 01:00:32.759
Deliver the truth to
those who need it most

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:48.449
Mr. Yin

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:52.020
welcome

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:11.139
Why does this have to happen now?

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:13.940
Are you OK?

01:01:51.909 --> 01:01:53.779
"Perfect Strangers"

01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:55.979
- Have you searched in the library?
- OK

01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:58.718
I can't believe Gao Meishi is a novelist.
this surprises me

01:01:58.719 --> 01:02:01.819
I wonder why all girls who study
are like this

01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:03.948
They act like they are special

01:02:03.949 --> 01:02:05.259
They took me the wrong way

01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:08.088
What confuses me the most is...

01:02:08.089 --> 01:02:09.290
This is this sentence

01:02:09.389 --> 01:02:11.400
"Women who read are in danger"

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:13.500
this may be a warning

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:16.170
Stop trying to lie to me

01:02:16.299 --> 01:02:17.429
i will expose you

01:02:19.339 --> 01:02:21.100
Sun A, why are you so annoying?

01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:23.839
If you don't want to be
like your sister, don't interfere

01:02:27.739 --> 01:02:29.810
"Perfect Strangers"
