"Kim Ki Joo"

00:40.950 --> 00:44.079
"My Perfect Stranger"

00:46.649 --> 00:48.049
It's been exactly one year since now...

00:48.049 --> 00:50.390
…I’ll die when I’m 35.

00:50.390 --> 00:53.259
Because my murderer is the real murderer...

00:53.259 --> 00:55.929
...1987 Uzhongli Serial Murder Case.

00:56.159 --> 00:58.299
That was the mark of a criminal in 1987.

00:58.299 --> 01:00.600
This was also found at the scene of my murder.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.829
How did he get this?

01:03.799 --> 01:06.540
He is a new student and will join your class from today.

01:06.540 --> 01:07.640
Her name is Bai Yunying.

01:10.879 --> 01:12.879
Don't act like we're friends. do you want to die

01:13.650 --> 01:15.780
Nice to meet you. My name is Liu Fanlong.

01:16.409 --> 01:18.150
- Be careful. - What?

01:18.920 --> 01:20.989
Do you think my sister will run away from you?

01:24.390 --> 01:25.659
because I like you.

01:26.859 --> 01:29.329
How do you know I'm there?

01:29.859 --> 01:31.959
The first suspect in the impending murder...

01:31.959 --> 01:33.599
...Three days later, Baek Hee-seop.

01:33.700 --> 01:35.700
The second suspect Liu Fanlong.

01:35.900 --> 01:37.370
The third suspect was jailed for 30 years…

01:37.370 --> 01:39.500
...After being convicted, Gao Minxiu.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.010
All these people you meet today.

01:45.640 --> 01:49.250
"My Perfect Stranger" Episode 4, is this all a coincidence?

01:50.049 --> 01:51.150
Who are you?

01:55.290 --> 01:56.650
Why are you here?

01:58.859 --> 02:00.159
what are you saying?

02:04.260 --> 02:05.530
“Bong Bong Tea Shop”

02:07.329 --> 02:08.530
How could this happen to you?

02:12.639 --> 02:14.610
It was on the floor, so I picked it up.

02:15.409 --> 02:17.139
It's too bad if you try to hide it.

02:18.110 --> 02:20.879
Why should I hide what I collect?

02:23.349 --> 02:26.719
no. I collected it.

02:27.419 --> 02:29.020
I also quoted it accidentally.

02:31.590 --> 02:34.229
Did you pick it up by chance?

02:35.789 --> 02:37.129
when and where?

02:39.659 --> 02:41.129
Before I got here.

02:41.900 --> 02:44.240
Just an hour before you hit me.

02:45.300 --> 02:48.340
I saw this floating object by the river in this village.

02:48.340 --> 02:50.069
I took it without thinking.

02:51.680 --> 02:52.740
"By the river."

02:54.009 --> 02:56.250
What are you doing so late?

02:57.680 --> 02:58.750
I...

03:04.060 --> 03:06.360
"Dear Yoon Young"

03:16.400 --> 03:17.469
Ada...

03:34.490 --> 03:36.150
Is this another thing you can't tell me?

03:38.860 --> 03:42.289
Just like why you want to meet Go Min Soo.

03:47.129 --> 03:49.099
I just have a few questions for him.

03:52.039 --> 03:54.610
That's all I can explain right now.

03:58.580 --> 03:59.639
OK

04:02.379 --> 04:04.479
That's all we can talk about.

04:09.419 --> 04:11.289
You still have not answered my question.

04:13.389 --> 04:15.389
When I asked you how you knew I was there...

04:15.389 --> 04:17.199
...You just need to give it to me...

04:18.660 --> 04:19.730
...this.

04:20.899 --> 04:22.000
What's this?

04:22.529 --> 04:23.899
What does this mean to you?

04:25.769 --> 04:27.370
The things that got me here.

04:30.069 --> 04:31.939
Something I have to keep looking for.

04:33.540 --> 04:36.680
Everything that happens has a cause and effect.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.149
That's all I can tell you right now.

04:42.990 --> 04:44.220
Unfortunately, it seems...

04:44.819 --> 04:47.430
...Neither of us was ready to tell the other.

05:00.439 --> 05:01.910
Yes. that's right.

05:17.589 --> 05:20.490
May 11, 1987.

05:21.529 --> 05:23.959
Three days before the first murder.

05:27.470 --> 05:29.000
This is a critical moment...

05:30.100 --> 05:32.199
…But the past as I knew it has changed.

05:36.069 --> 05:37.740
A new event has occurred.

05:40.649 --> 05:42.449
The prime suspect...no.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.449
Gao Minxiu, who was accused of being the real murderer...

05:46.980 --> 05:48.519
... was detained by the police.

05:49.319 --> 05:50.790
What happens now?

05:51.790 --> 05:52.920
You chose that one...

05:53.829 --> 05:54.959
...coincidence?

05:56.930 --> 05:59.360
“Bong Bong Tea Shop”

05:59.360 --> 06:01.569
What is he hiding?

06:03.600 --> 06:05.569
Why does he have such an expression?

06:11.839 --> 06:13.910
"Wuzhong Police Station"

06:19.579 --> 06:21.550
"What did you do after that?"

06:23.519 --> 06:25.519
That's all we can tell you.

06:26.120 --> 06:28.689
OK This is fine now. You can go back now.

06:32.629 --> 06:35.129
"Detective Part 2"

06:35.730 --> 06:37.300
He doesn't want to talk.

06:38.939 --> 06:40.139
That's good news.

06:40.670 --> 06:42.110
He wasted his time.

06:43.509 --> 06:44.779
What do you mean?

06:48.680 --> 06:50.750
People like him should be locked up in jail for as long as possible...

06:50.750 --> 06:52.379
...for the safety of this village.

06:54.420 --> 06:56.149
We don't know what else he'll do.

07:11.569 --> 07:13.269
So, keep doing this.

07:14.139 --> 07:16.569
Don't say or do anything.

07:16.810 --> 07:18.009
sitting there...

07:18.610 --> 07:21.209
...and try not leaving the house for a week.

07:22.750 --> 07:25.250
If nothing happens that week...

07:25.779 --> 07:28.220
…It will confirm that you killed them.

07:30.149 --> 07:32.060
Otherwise you will be proven innocent.

07:33.259 --> 07:34.259
"Kill them?"

07:34.589 --> 07:37.459
useless. what are you saying?

07:38.029 --> 07:39.430
Shut up, useless kid!

07:44.439 --> 07:46.139
Please keep an eye on him.

07:54.910 --> 07:58.050
"Balay City"

08:07.860 --> 08:09.529
What does this mean to him?

08:23.910 --> 08:25.180
No I'm fine.

08:27.250 --> 08:29.149
it's all over. I'm fine now.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.419
"troll"

09:31.639 --> 09:33.379
I really have lost my appetite.

09:34.649 --> 09:35.809
You haven't eaten anything.

09:36.980 --> 09:38.620
You should eat something first before you can get a good night's sleep.

09:43.149 --> 09:45.059
We're not close enough to eat together.

09:46.259 --> 09:48.490
"Codade"

09:51.259 --> 09:53.129
“H Tea Shop”

09:53.559 --> 09:55.870
He wants me to drink coffee on an empty stomach?

09:56.200 --> 09:57.870
“H Tea Shop”

09:58.669 --> 10:00.139
Is this the name of the teahouse?

10:01.710 --> 10:02.710
Unique.

10:13.019 --> 10:16.190
Hey. Can we be open for another 30 minutes today?

10:16.350 --> 10:17.820
All restaurants are closed.

10:22.429 --> 10:24.500
I can’t let women starve on dates.

10:26.700 --> 10:27.929
no. I never said...

10:31.299 --> 10:32.340
well.

10:46.419 --> 10:47.419
No.

10:48.549 --> 10:50.720
Why do teahouses sell this?

10:51.919 --> 10:52.919
Just like the original poster.

10:53.519 --> 10:55.490
He is quite unique.

10:55.490 --> 10:56.590
He also enjoys taking care of other people's clothes.

10:57.460 --> 10:59.929
Oh yes, people nowadays...

11:00.299 --> 11:02.100
...sauce the bread?

11:03.470 --> 11:04.639
I have no idea.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.769
None of the bread tasted salty.

11:12.480 --> 11:15.049
Try their bread.

11:18.320 --> 11:21.590
I have no appetite...

11:22.649 --> 11:24.059
…but you already bought it…

11:52.379 --> 11:55.090
Do you really like salty and sweet food?

11:57.019 --> 11:59.019
Don’t you know this is a must for modern people?

11:59.620 --> 12:01.059
For a month, I finished my work every morning…

12:01.059 --> 12:02.429
...to meet deadlines.

12:02.789 --> 12:04.559
When I want to relax on the weekend...

12:04.600 --> 12:07.200
...I manage my phone as a writer...

12:07.200 --> 12:10.230
...complains about pen ink he doesn't like...

12:10.230 --> 12:12.240
...It made me lose my will to live.

12:13.970 --> 12:15.440
But sweet and salty food...

12:16.470 --> 12:17.840
...seems to have revived me.

12:18.980 --> 12:20.379
Have you ever worked for a publishing company?

12:20.679 --> 12:21.679
Are you an editor?

12:24.120 --> 12:25.179
And you?

12:25.980 --> 12:27.019
I lost my job.

12:29.919 --> 12:32.860
certainly. You don't want to tell me.

12:33.789 --> 12:36.590
I'm the only one telling the truth.

12:37.759 --> 12:39.500
not like this.

12:54.879 --> 12:56.049
Oops, this is the worst.

13:05.159 --> 13:06.220
sorry.

13:06.919 --> 13:09.590
You don't have to apologize. Our tastes are different.

13:13.460 --> 13:17.330
I promise not to trouble you.

13:20.340 --> 13:22.940
But I got you to the station.

13:25.240 --> 13:26.480
I am really sorry.

13:33.179 --> 13:35.320
But you weren't the one who made this happen.

13:36.389 --> 13:39.120
Whatever you want to ask him or something else...

13:39.889 --> 13:42.690
...This kind of thing shouldn't happen...

13:42.990 --> 13:45.230
...even if you follow him for some reason.

13:46.960 --> 13:50.129
This problem is his, not yours.

13:53.470 --> 13:54.940
You don't have to apologize.

13:55.539 --> 13:57.169
Don't be too scared.

14:00.009 --> 14:02.549
I won't let that happen.

14:10.019 --> 14:11.990
I'll make sure the light is fixed as soon as possible.

14:34.549 --> 14:37.549
"Pavagam Wu Zheng"

14:40.879 --> 14:42.149
Do you think you can run?

14:44.149 --> 14:45.159
certainly.

15:27.399 --> 15:28.500
They are so crazy.

15:29.100 --> 15:30.830
Why do donuts add soy sauce?

15:47.519 --> 15:48.820
wheat.

15:49.990 --> 15:51.889
Go in and finish this thing quietly.

15:52.759 --> 15:54.590
do not tell anyone.

15:56.029 --> 15:57.029
OK

16:44.879 --> 16:47.509
“Bong Bong Tea Shop”

16:53.950 --> 16:55.549
What's his story?

17:21.980 --> 17:23.650
I left early because I still had things to do.

17:24.009 --> 17:25.549
Eat breakfast, bring food...

17:25.549 --> 17:27.049
...and then went to Shun Ai's house across the street.

17:27.519 --> 17:29.450
Of course, they are waiting for you. I told them earlier.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.720
Make sure to apply more medication to the wound.

17:31.819 --> 17:34.730
You don't have to wash the dishes. Just place it in the sink.

17:35.289 --> 17:37.329
do not be late.

17:38.130 --> 17:39.299
She chattered like a mother.

17:49.039 --> 17:50.839
"A wonderful and extraordinary life"

18:00.480 --> 18:01.490
mark!

18:02.650 --> 18:04.119
- Mrs! - How is this going?

18:04.119 --> 18:05.759
Mom, can't you see my shiny leggings?

18:05.759 --> 18:07.490
I might be late for the salon.

18:07.490 --> 18:08.589
it's useless.

18:08.589 --> 18:10.329
You get drunk during the day and make a scene at night.

18:10.859 --> 18:13.660
Oops, mommy needs to make fried eggs for Wu Fu.

18:15.230 --> 18:16.299
- Honey. - Yes?

18:16.299 --> 18:18.400
Why are there no good socks?

18:18.440 --> 18:20.970
You took a pair from the basket, not the closet, right?

18:20.970 --> 18:23.970
I said I put the socks with holes in the basket.

18:23.970 --> 18:24.980
Why do you always take...

18:24.980 --> 18:26.579
- ...from there? - Mrs! No tissues.

18:26.839 --> 18:29.180
Oh yes. Let me get it.

18:29.250 --> 18:31.819
Mom, I asked about my tights first.

18:32.920 --> 18:34.250
where is my wallet

18:34.380 --> 18:36.589
Oh yes. I also changed my pants. My purse

18:36.589 --> 18:37.650
- What? - My purse.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.960
- I didn't take out your wallet. - Mrs.

18:39.960 --> 18:41.930
- Mom, are the fried eggs ready? - Fried eggs?

18:42.490 --> 18:43.589
Not again.

18:44.259 --> 18:46.759
You can't feel the kimbap directly.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.829
- Really? - what are you saying?

18:48.829 --> 18:51.029
Eat. Mom, you always make plain kimbap.

18:51.440 --> 18:53.769
It's time for you to eat too.

19:08.420 --> 19:09.549
well.

19:10.289 --> 19:12.289
That useless book!

19:14.119 --> 19:15.460
You have finished folding...

19:15.460 --> 19:18.000
...fried eggs for your sister.

19:18.259 --> 19:20.630
Now. Stop folding.

19:20.630 --> 19:22.529
Go cook some fried eggs for Wu Fu.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.269
Now.

19:25.470 --> 19:26.539
OK

19:38.750 --> 19:39.750
Hello?

19:44.289 --> 19:45.289
I'll be back in a moment.

19:54.500 --> 19:55.799
Are you Wu Bo?

19:56.900 --> 19:57.900
Who are you?

20:00.440 --> 20:03.069
This is me, sir. Yin Yong.

20:06.640 --> 20:07.710
What's wrong?

20:08.680 --> 20:10.309
Who are you...

20:10.309 --> 20:12.150
...standing on my page and blinking your big eyes?

20:12.619 --> 20:13.720
Dato?

20:15.190 --> 20:16.619
This is me. Yin Ying!

20:21.730 --> 20:24.359
I may not have enough time to change my socks.

20:24.559 --> 20:25.930
Give me a pair quickly.

20:26.529 --> 20:28.670
- Honey! - I am coming!

20:28.769 --> 20:31.339
Stop calling me!

20:51.420 --> 20:53.119
after that...

20:57.029 --> 20:58.029
well.

21:00.500 --> 21:01.829
Hello, Teacher Yin.

21:04.230 --> 21:07.599
Give me the matchbox that was in the hallway yesterday.

21:11.940 --> 21:13.079

21:14.109 --> 21:17.579
...very beautiful. Who are you?

wheat.

21:18.779 --> 21:20.480
Where is the beauty?

21:20.480 --> 21:22.619
He looked like a wet money order.

21:24.920 --> 21:27.160
You're not late, are you? Shut up and go to work.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.559
Bottle feet.

21:28.789 --> 21:29.859
OK

21:32.059 --> 21:33.059
What?

21:34.630 --> 21:36.500
- Ouch. - wait for me.

21:37.430 --> 21:38.900
- goodbye. - goodbye.

21:40.099 --> 21:42.769
so you...

21:42.970 --> 21:45.440
...Teacher Yin’s husband’s family...

21:45.440 --> 21:48.380
so. You are Ms. Yin’s brother.

21:48.549 --> 21:50.210
You should have told me earlier.

21:50.509 --> 21:51.579
Nice to meet you.

21:51.579 --> 21:55.049
You look as smart as Ms. Yin.

21:55.349 --> 21:56.450
You look very smart.

21:59.059 --> 22:01.829
Teacher Yin can't accompany you...

22:01.829 --> 22:05.799
…So he asked me to make sure you go with Soon-ae.

22:06.130 --> 22:09.529
I also prepared lunch for you and Cikgu Yoon.

22:09.569 --> 22:11.769
- Eat later. - I also brought supplies.

22:11.769 --> 22:13.869
That's your lunch.

22:13.869 --> 22:15.369
this is mine.

22:16.839 --> 22:18.910
Chew properly when eating.

22:19.039 --> 22:21.410
If you want to eat my food, come back anytime.

22:22.349 --> 22:25.779
Always come, my dear.

22:26.049 --> 22:27.779
OK Thanks.

22:30.119 --> 22:31.119
That's very good.

22:35.859 --> 22:36.859
well.

22:37.759 --> 22:39.400
“Bong Bong Tea Shop”

22:40.630 --> 22:42.700
- Love letter? - Yes.

22:43.230 --> 22:45.140
Write a note in it...

22:45.140 --> 22:47.740
...then give it to the guy you're interested in or the girl you like.

22:48.140 --> 22:50.569
Boys in other classes must do the same.

22:50.970 --> 22:53.640
This is very popular in our school.

22:56.349 --> 22:59.650
This silly trend further complicates the situation.

23:00.349 --> 23:01.349
What?

23:03.750 --> 23:04.920
"my darling."

23:05.789 --> 23:06.890
Dear who?

23:07.390 --> 23:08.930
How could you fall in love with him so quickly?

23:08.930 --> 23:10.589
I have another matchbox for the new boy.

23:10.589 --> 23:12.630
This is for another girl.

23:12.799 --> 23:15.869
If you already love someone else, why give it to him?

23:16.829 --> 23:18.369
Are you avoiding it?

23:18.569 --> 23:20.500
If that's the case, I won't give it to him.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.140
Why did the teacher hit me in the mouth?

23:22.569 --> 23:23.640
come over.

23:26.809 --> 23:30.349
"Use the toilet like we do."

23:30.349 --> 23:31.380
What do I want to do?

23:32.519 --> 23:33.579
well.

23:51.799 --> 23:53.339
Why don't you go out?

23:56.009 --> 23:58.839
OK I am coming.

24:26.700 --> 24:29.769
The main reason why Liu Beomyong was listed as the main suspect is...

24:31.410 --> 24:33.440
...It's because of what he's hiding.

25:16.490 --> 25:18.390
So far nothing. Really?

25:35.970 --> 25:37.210
What's this?

25:38.210 --> 25:40.680
sorry...

25:41.410 --> 25:42.549
...about yesterday.

25:44.609 --> 25:47.920
You were just trying to help me, but I was still cruel.

25:50.650 --> 25:53.089
It bothered me all night so I couldn't sleep.

25:53.890 --> 25:54.930
therefore.

25:55.930 --> 25:57.630
You always write...

25:57.630 --> 25:59.359
...although you will apologize in advance.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.200
You always do this every time we fight.

26:04.299 --> 26:05.339
I?

26:06.539 --> 26:07.569
yes?

26:11.539 --> 26:13.109
I mean, my mom.

26:13.609 --> 26:14.950
It suddenly occurred to me.

26:17.410 --> 26:19.650
Of course he loved writing.

26:24.119 --> 26:25.220
perhaps.

26:26.460 --> 26:28.630
"Hey Yoon Young. Yi Ni Soon Ae."

26:30.589 --> 26:32.599
I don't think that's the reason...

26:34.230 --> 26:35.500
...so far.

26:41.599 --> 26:43.440
- Hello. - Hello.

26:48.779 --> 26:50.309
The second forehead?

26:53.180 --> 26:54.380
Teacher Yin. that's right.

26:55.650 --> 26:58.420
There is a matchbox in your front pocket. give it to me.

26:58.490 --> 26:59.490
What?

27:00.920 --> 27:03.329
Is there a matchbox in my bag? Where?

27:05.859 --> 27:08.670
Teachers can't go through other people's schoolbags like this.

27:08.670 --> 27:10.299
“Bong Bong Tea Shop”

27:10.569 --> 27:11.630
What?

27:12.700 --> 27:14.000
There is indeed one inside.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.170
You just moved in yesterday...

27:15.170 --> 27:17.309
…So you don’t know the trends.

27:18.009 --> 27:20.539
Why do students take matchboxes from the teahouse?

27:23.109 --> 27:24.150
How could it be there?

27:26.150 --> 27:28.049
I remembered.

27:28.349 --> 27:30.150
My brother is coming this Sunday...

27:30.150 --> 27:31.549
...and wanted to introduce me to coffee.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.420
He took me to a teahouse in town...

27:33.420 --> 27:34.589
...I made a tower out of matchboxes there.

27:34.720 --> 27:37.259
It's so funny, he...

27:37.589 --> 27:39.529
Does your brother still have the Mango key?

27:39.529 --> 27:40.759
certainly.

27:42.529 --> 27:43.970
Mango key?

27:46.140 --> 27:47.799
Why is your bag so light?

27:47.970 --> 27:50.569
Should I bring books on school trips?

27:50.740 --> 27:52.640
Didn't he make lunch?

27:53.880 --> 27:55.250
not like this.

27:55.509 --> 27:58.650
Yes, but I forgot to bring it.

27:59.519 --> 28:01.650
Tell your friends to find my bag.

28:02.619 --> 28:05.119
I go through your bag, so you can go through mine.

28:05.359 --> 28:06.789
Take the food out of my bag.

28:06.789 --> 28:08.059
Buy soda...

28:13.099 --> 28:16.200
...can also be purchased for boys in other classes.

28:18.269 --> 28:19.339
This is a task for you.

28:20.400 --> 28:21.440
OK

28:24.509 --> 28:26.579
Rochester's room was engulfed in fire...

28:26.740 --> 28:28.779
...Jane put it out with a bucket of water.

28:28.779 --> 28:30.009
He held her wrist...

28:30.450 --> 28:32.380
…and said, “You saved my life.”

28:32.980 --> 28:34.779
Where can I stop reading?

28:36.420 --> 28:39.059
Then my mother hit me with a spatula.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.190
But you just read it.

28:43.359 --> 28:45.130
He hates me reading.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.799
He said I was wasting my time doing useless things...

28:47.799 --> 28:49.630
...than doing homework.

28:51.069 --> 28:52.099
well.

28:52.970 --> 28:55.140
I want to read all my favorite books...

28:55.140 --> 28:56.670
...listen to as much music as you want.

28:57.210 --> 29:00.609
I also want to enjoy my coffee. I wish I could live like this.

29:04.450 --> 29:05.980
Mom's dream...

29:06.980 --> 29:08.279
...come true...

29:09.519 --> 29:10.619
...through me.

29:23.829 --> 29:24.829
Why?

29:26.869 --> 29:28.039
I am very happy.

29:29.440 --> 29:30.670
When you're done, give me the cup.

29:31.140 --> 29:32.940
Mom is ready to wash up. I'll wash it later.

29:32.980 --> 29:34.910
Just leave it to mom. Leave it to mom.

29:35.150 --> 29:38.079
Read as many books as you want.

29:38.849 --> 29:41.450
you leave me

29:42.650 --> 29:44.619
you go

30:02.470 --> 30:03.569
Why?

30:04.910 --> 30:06.910
what do you mean...

30:07.509 --> 30:10.779
I just want to know what you heard.

30:15.589 --> 30:16.750
give it to me. Let me clean it up.

30:16.849 --> 30:18.089
It doesn't matter.

30:18.190 --> 30:20.390
After you get married, you can do it until you get bored.

30:22.390 --> 30:23.960
I will not bother you. Continue reading this book.

30:25.460 --> 30:26.730
I'm tired of hearing this.

30:26.960 --> 30:28.569
I told my mother many times that I will not get married.

30:30.369 --> 30:31.470
wheat...

30:32.500 --> 30:34.769
...give me some time...

30:35.269 --> 30:37.240
...He can't get it.

30:40.980 --> 30:42.049
What are you doing?

30:42.480 --> 30:45.650
I'll give it back to mom now.

30:46.180 --> 30:47.819
Mom’s lost time.

30:48.279 --> 30:49.920
Everything is let go by you.

30:51.049 --> 30:53.519
I will give everything back to my mother.

30:54.720 --> 30:57.160
We'll be late. We must run.

30:58.430 --> 31:00.829
Why did you go there? Our school is there.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.900
Didn't you hear it at the end of get out of class yesterday?

31:03.500 --> 31:05.029
Today is study tour day.

31:09.869 --> 31:10.910
Yes.

31:12.410 --> 31:13.509
you are right.

31:14.809 --> 31:15.880
wait.

31:16.450 --> 31:18.250
——Kim Hae-kyung. - Yes.

31:18.309 --> 31:20.420
- Lee Eun Ha - Me!

31:20.480 --> 31:22.089
- Park your own car! - yes!

31:22.349 --> 31:23.990
- Seo Ji Eun. - Ya.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.319
- Yoo Eun-young. - Yes.

31:27.160 --> 31:28.690
—— Kwon Soo Kyung. - I.

31:28.730 --> 31:32.599
- Bai Yun... - Oh my God.

31:34.859 --> 31:35.869
Teacher Yin.

31:38.299 --> 31:39.339
Teacher Yin.

31:39.569 --> 31:40.640
What?

31:41.069 --> 31:42.670
what are you doing here?

31:43.339 --> 31:45.069
Shouldn't you check on the arrival of your class?

31:45.910 --> 31:48.140
Look at it. They are not organized.

31:48.140 --> 31:50.549
- look. - you can! hurry up.

31:51.480 --> 31:52.619
No. look.

31:54.119 --> 31:56.150
On average, they sit. well.

31:56.450 --> 31:59.319
Boys who don't study always get into trouble.

31:59.319 --> 32:01.990
I write clearly to avoid being late. for real?

32:02.029 --> 32:03.589
He makes me nervous. well.

32:04.259 --> 32:05.829
Why did you get down?

32:06.930 --> 32:07.960
Hey!

32:08.059 --> 32:09.329
Take it easy.

32:17.039 --> 32:20.210
Why would the principal match my class with his?

32:21.440 --> 32:22.509
well.

32:25.009 --> 32:26.619
You're right next to the marshmallow. You'd better leave now.

32:27.220 --> 32:28.480
it's useless.

32:33.089 --> 32:34.089
Son Jung-sook.

32:56.680 --> 32:58.509
How do you know the second forehead...

32:59.319 --> 33:00.980
...Which one is the Mango Key?

33:44.789 --> 33:45.799
Soon Ai.

33:47.599 --> 33:48.730
The guy from the terminal.

33:54.839 --> 33:56.609
Since we met here again...

33:56.940 --> 33:58.269
...means we are dating...

33:58.269 --> 33:59.740
Don't count on it!

34:08.619 --> 34:09.690
Listen, Soon Ae.

34:11.219 --> 34:12.219
Look at his face.

34:12.820 --> 34:15.260
You are just wasting your time on this person.

34:16.190 --> 34:17.690
what are you saying?

34:17.929 --> 34:19.429
He won't do...

34:20.860 --> 34:22.329
...your life gets better.

34:23.699 --> 34:25.099
You look out of breath.

34:25.940 --> 34:27.139
How about we go now?

34:27.739 --> 34:30.039
But then...

34:30.039 --> 34:31.369
You can't take him anywhere.

34:31.969 --> 34:34.780
Being so out of breath, it's better to take a rest first.

34:36.110 --> 34:37.710
Rest first, then climb.

34:41.750 --> 34:43.849
Hey.

34:44.019 --> 34:45.989
Soon Ai!

34:46.960 --> 34:47.960
it's useless.

35:10.579 --> 35:11.809
The sky looks beautiful.

35:23.289 --> 35:25.030
- Ouch. - Ouch.

35:25.190 --> 35:26.960
Why are there so many hills?

35:27.699 --> 35:29.300
Why would anyone come here for a school picnic?

35:30.699 --> 35:33.840
For someone born in 1965, it's an uphill climb.

35:38.010 --> 35:39.010
OK

35:39.380 --> 35:41.909
You are here today to have fun. So have fun.

35:41.909 --> 35:44.480
Don't peek at your textbook...

35:44.480 --> 35:46.920
...because you are worried about the college entrance examination.

35:47.119 --> 35:49.050
-Fan Long. -Fan Long.

35:49.050 --> 35:52.190
- Ouch. - This is not good.

35:52.389 --> 35:53.420
OK

35:53.590 --> 35:55.159
Have a great day.

35:55.159 --> 35:57.860
But don't leave the area. OK?

35:57.860 --> 35:59.559
- All right. - All right.

35:59.559 --> 36:00.659
Minister of Entertainment, come out.

36:02.059 --> 36:05.300
OK You all know who I am, right?

36:05.300 --> 36:06.539
- yes! - yes!

36:06.539 --> 36:08.340
What was the highlight of the school picnic?

36:08.469 --> 36:09.570
- talent show. - talent show.

36:09.710 --> 36:11.969
that's right. We will have a talent show.

36:11.969 --> 36:13.440
Hey, this is a big moment.

36:13.840 --> 36:15.210
You have brought me a precious gift.

36:15.210 --> 36:17.679
- OK. Who wants to try it? - I stole it for you...

36:18.179 --> 36:19.250
...from my father.

36:21.019 --> 36:22.019
Hey.

36:22.019 --> 36:23.289
But do you think you can do it?

36:23.690 --> 36:26.019
You said you'd never played a real guitar before.

36:32.059 --> 36:33.659
I need to stop playing that invisible guitar.

36:33.659 --> 36:34.929
I want to try it.

36:37.429 --> 36:38.670
No.

36:39.300 --> 36:41.139
Shouldn't we practice it first?

36:43.369 --> 36:45.880
You might embarrass yourself in front of women.

36:46.079 --> 36:48.340
We now start the talent show.

36:48.340 --> 36:49.510
Everyone applauded.

36:51.349 --> 36:52.780
OK Who wants to try it?

36:55.219 --> 36:56.219
nobody?

36:56.789 --> 36:58.519
well. Is that all you can do?

37:02.889 --> 37:04.289
I'm tired of practicing.

37:06.360 --> 37:07.429
OK

37:07.800 --> 37:10.199
If you rest like everyone else...

37:10.699 --> 37:12.070
...you'll miss it.

37:12.840 --> 37:14.639
- Oh my gosh, eh. garden. - You are all high school students.

37:15.269 --> 37:17.070
Don't get too excited.

37:17.070 --> 37:19.210
Always thinking about the college entrance examination.

37:27.219 --> 37:28.320
attention!

37:28.650 --> 37:29.719
I'm still talking.

37:29.849 --> 37:31.420
Always thinking about the college entrance examination.

37:31.420 --> 37:32.920
can you stop talking

37:32.960 --> 37:34.559
- What? - We didn't hear him sing.

37:35.019 --> 37:36.659
Teacher, let’s take a five-minute break!

37:36.659 --> 37:38.429
- Thanks. - Let's go first.

37:38.429 --> 37:40.260
- where are you going? - Thanks.

37:40.559 --> 37:41.559
Hey.

37:42.400 --> 37:43.929
This is not good.

37:47.570 --> 37:49.139
Did nothing really happen?

37:49.369 --> 37:50.409
No.

37:51.510 --> 37:52.909
I just said two things.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.380
Then we met his class teacher.

37:56.610 --> 37:58.210
Teacher Yin pulled his ears and dragged him away.

38:00.119 --> 38:01.519
What two sentences did you say to him?

38:02.320 --> 38:04.920
He asked me what kind of man I like.

38:05.250 --> 38:07.420
So I said I like men who can sing.

38:12.730 --> 38:13.760
Mali.

38:14.099 --> 38:15.099
Hey.

38:38.219 --> 38:39.360
It doesn't matter!

38:39.519 --> 38:42.119
- OK. you can! - hurry up!

39:18.690 --> 39:20.829
Does he know how to play guitar?

39:21.199 --> 39:24.099
Forget it

39:24.230 --> 39:26.739
and start talking

39:26.739 --> 39:29.340
stop boring things

39:29.340 --> 39:30.739
- Who is that boy? - Start talking wholeheartedly

39:32.070 --> 39:33.239
- He is a new student. - My body is shaking, I'm restless

39:33.510 --> 39:35.039
I hesitated, feeling unsure

39:35.039 --> 39:37.050
- My face is bright red - My face is bright red

39:37.050 --> 39:38.610
- I hesitate, feeling unsure - I hesitate, feeling unsure

39:40.519 --> 39:43.320
I will be alone after breakup

39:43.349 --> 39:46.019
I will cry because my heart is broken

39:46.019 --> 39:48.760
I know I'll regret it when he leaves

39:48.760 --> 39:51.329
- My face is bright red - My face is bright red

39:51.329 --> 39:52.659
My body is shaking and I'm restless

39:52.699 --> 39:54.059

39:54.059 --> 39:56.329

- My body is shaking, I'm restless - My body is shaking, I'm restless

39:59.639 --> 40:03.639
- I should tell him - I should tell him

40:03.639 --> 40:05.010
- I should tell him - I should tell him

40:05.010 --> 40:09.010
- I should tell him - I should tell him

40:09.010 --> 40:10.380
- I should tell him - I should tell him

40:10.380 --> 40:11.780
i should tell him

40:11.780 --> 40:13.150
- I should tell him - I should tell him

40:13.150 --> 40:14.150
i should tell him

40:14.150 --> 40:15.320
12 plum.

40:15.820 --> 40:17.920
Two days before the first murder.

40:19.190 --> 40:22.320
One of the three suspects has been detained by police.

40:22.929 --> 40:24.030
Two other suspects...

40:24.690 --> 40:26.360
...did not exhibit any unusual movements.

40:28.059 --> 40:30.130
The matchbox is the symbol of the criminal.

40:30.130 --> 40:31.300
“Bong Bong Tea Shop”

40:31.300 --> 40:32.469
It's everywhere.

40:33.599 --> 40:35.570
well. My head is dizzy.

40:41.380 --> 40:44.380
When everything seems confusing...

40:46.119 --> 40:47.849
...He's arrived.

40:49.889 --> 40:52.989
He is the first victim of the Yu Zhongli serial murder case.

40:53.719 --> 40:54.719
He is there.

40:59.800 --> 41:01.429
You remember them, right?

41:01.929 --> 41:04.230

41:24.250 --> 41:25.389
These boys.

41:25.389 --> 41:26.420
stand.

41:26.989 --> 41:28.559
It doesn't matter.

41:28.559 --> 41:30.590
Everyone sit down. no problem. sit down.

41:33.530 --> 41:36.900

41:41.599 --> 41:42.670
...Majoring in Korean Literature.

41:42.969 --> 41:45.469
He should start tomorrow.

41:45.469 --> 41:46.809
But today I brought him here...

41:46.809 --> 41:49.179
...so that one day I can introduce him to you.

41:49.179 --> 41:50.710
Give him a round of applause.

41:51.050 --> 41:52.210
Where do I see him?

41:58.150 --> 42:01.489
Teacher Li! You should sing for us too!

42:02.159 --> 42:05.260
- Sing for us! - Sing for us!

42:05.260 --> 42:08.159
- Sing for us! - Sing for us!

42:08.159 --> 42:09.699
- Sing for us! - Sing for us!

42:09.699 --> 42:11.800
- Sing for us! - shut up.

42:11.800 --> 42:13.400
- shut up! - I can sing.

42:16.369 --> 42:17.909
OK please.

42:19.210 --> 42:20.239
you are awesome!

42:22.480 --> 42:23.579
You are wonderful.

42:26.280 --> 42:32.250
strong wind blowing

42:32.920 --> 42:37.829
A mother sheds tears

42:38.530 --> 42:43.670
in this independent world

42:44.269 --> 42:47.940
A place where one cries for painful revenge

42:49.139 --> 42:51.070
- Human Soul - What is it?

42:51.070 --> 42:54.880
- have no idea. Never heard of it. - Become the master of this world

42:55.539 --> 43:00.550
- He ruined the mood. -For the freedom of the world

43:00.980 --> 43:06.119
- Even if your heart turns blue - He's charming.

43:06.789 --> 43:08.119
Don't you think so?

43:08.119 --> 43:11.460
- Keep Rowing - Why is this song so sad?

43:11.590 --> 43:13.699
Lagu "Dear Qingsong".

43:13.699 --> 43:15.630
Oh, Qingsong

43:15.659 --> 43:17.900
Do you know this song?

43:17.900 --> 43:20.800
- No. - Don't sway in the wind

43:20.800 --> 43:23.539
- From the East - Why is it so common?

43:23.539 --> 43:28.809
Under the bar where I'm tied up

43:28.809 --> 43:33.280
Live until we meet again

43:34.980 --> 43:36.250
- Ouch. - what is that?

43:37.920 --> 43:38.920
well.

43:41.360 --> 43:44.059
I asked you not to send me off, but you two came?

43:44.789 --> 43:48.300
If anyone needs to post it, let me post it.

43:48.300 --> 43:49.869
In this case, I will go back.

43:49.869 --> 43:52.070
No, not you. You should sit here.

43:54.340 --> 43:58.110
Teacher Park. Don’t you think Miss Yin looks like the same person?

43:58.570 --> 44:00.809
...Every time I see him?

44:06.280 --> 44:07.380
I have no idea.

44:07.949 --> 44:10.050
I rarely watch TV.

44:11.690 --> 44:13.519
No, not the people on TV.

44:13.760 --> 44:16.329
Look at the people around you.

44:19.329 --> 44:20.699
I have no idea.

44:20.900 --> 44:23.400
I am not interested in the people around me.

44:23.400 --> 44:25.269
Why?

44:25.869 --> 44:27.039
Teacher Park, I like everything about you...

44:27.039 --> 44:28.369
…But you’re really wet!

44:28.739 --> 44:29.840
well.

44:30.340 --> 44:31.340
I...

44:32.309 --> 44:33.940
…Need to come back and mentor students.

44:35.139 --> 44:36.150
Let me ask myself first.

44:40.550 --> 44:41.849
it's useless.

44:42.519 --> 44:44.550
Ugh, I should fire him.

44:47.360 --> 44:48.960
I heard you went to the police station yesterday.

44:49.059 --> 44:51.059
- Yes. - Is there anything I can do to help?

44:52.130 --> 44:53.760
No, everything is fine.

44:53.760 --> 44:55.699
- Thank you for your condolences. - It doesn't matter.

44:55.699 --> 44:56.929
- Actually it is?

44:57.429 --> 44:59.000
I've asked you before.

44:59.329 --> 45:01.500
Can I manage new trainee teachers?

45:01.500 --> 45:04.639
OK We decided to do this.

45:04.639 --> 45:05.670
of.

45:08.809 --> 45:10.909
In fact, instead of doing this...

45:10.909 --> 45:13.050
No, we are different.

45:14.480 --> 45:15.480
Mali.

45:20.019 --> 45:22.360
He looks just like my younger self.

45:25.030 --> 45:26.199
Yes, we do look alike.

45:26.360 --> 45:29.500
kindness. Cui, let's go.

45:31.500 --> 45:32.800
well.

45:46.380 --> 45:47.519
impossible!

45:50.250 --> 45:52.389
Why does his face look normal?

45:53.519 --> 45:55.289
But I can't find the people I usually see here.

46:09.710 --> 46:12.170
Alas, son of five moments...

46:13.909 --> 46:16.150
Did Teacher Yin do it himself?

46:16.480 --> 46:17.510
of.

46:17.909 --> 46:19.210
delicious.

46:19.449 --> 46:21.079
correct? my grandmother...

46:23.789 --> 46:26.320
Your mom’s kimbap is also delicious.

46:30.230 --> 46:33.429
You talked to me casually after the incident in the lab.

46:38.469 --> 46:40.199
Because we are friends.

46:44.269 --> 46:45.369
that's right.

46:46.210 --> 46:47.409
You can call me any name.

46:50.309 --> 46:51.380
Bai Runying.

46:52.210 --> 46:53.980
"My love and passion for you."

46:54.750 --> 46:58.219
This is a love letter from the man who was there.

46:58.219 --> 46:59.250
No.

46:59.690 --> 47:01.159
This is for Soon Ae.

47:01.920 --> 47:05.289
Accept those gentlemen's feelings.

47:06.059 --> 47:07.130
Thanks.

47:52.909 --> 47:55.440
"Women who read are in danger."

47:56.480 --> 47:58.610
I can't say this is a normal thing.

47:59.480 --> 48:02.119
But that doesn't make sense...

48:02.119 --> 48:05.489
…I collected things from 30 years ago by the river.

48:05.889 --> 48:08.659
Did you pick it up by chance?

48:09.559 --> 48:10.829
when and where?

48:10.960 --> 48:12.030
"By the river."

48:13.329 --> 48:15.500
What are you doing so late?

48:23.969 --> 48:27.309
Of course he knew something.

48:37.519 --> 48:39.150
“Bong Bong Tea Shop”

48:46.090 --> 48:47.300
Take it quickly.

48:48.559 --> 48:50.869
- Take it. - I said I didn't want to.

48:51.099 --> 48:52.630
He doesn't want it! go!

48:53.969 --> 48:55.699
useless. OK

49:03.980 --> 49:05.050
what happen?

49:17.489 --> 49:19.460
- We'll be back first, teacher. - We'll be back first, teacher.

49:19.460 --> 49:21.460
- We'll be back first. - go home directly.

49:24.800 --> 49:26.940
Have you decided where to live this month?

49:27.300 --> 49:29.969
Yes, my brother lives around here.

49:30.739 --> 49:31.869
He is lying.

49:32.440 --> 49:35.710
He has no family or relatives.

49:36.949 --> 49:39.079
Why would he cheat?

49:40.849 --> 49:41.880
so.

49:42.519 --> 49:43.949
But who knows...

49:48.190 --> 49:49.389
This is my home phone number.

49:52.789 --> 49:53.800
No.

49:57.300 --> 50:00.769
I tell students to remember my phone number.

50:01.440 --> 50:03.000
It's like an emergency number.

50:07.539 --> 50:10.280
If anything happens please feel free to call me.

50:10.280 --> 50:11.909
Even if it's a trivial thing, I don't care.

50:12.650 --> 50:13.679
Thanks.

50:14.650 --> 50:17.449
But I'm fine because my relatives are here.

50:19.320 --> 50:21.719
But you shouldn't throw it away.

50:22.789 --> 50:23.789
OK

50:24.159 --> 50:26.260
The road conditions are not bad. See you tomorrow.

50:39.070 --> 50:40.340
Wait, my thermos.

50:41.239 --> 50:42.980
Of course, I was left there.

50:42.980 --> 50:44.610
- Let me go with you. - No.

50:44.949 --> 50:47.619
It's right there, so let me hurry up and go. Wait here.

50:49.519 --> 50:50.989
Don't run! Be careful.

50:51.289 --> 50:52.320
All right!

51:03.000 --> 51:06.300
Is it your responsibility to put my brother in a detention center?

51:08.099 --> 51:10.010
Your brother made it himself.

51:11.369 --> 51:13.710
He was imprisoned for his actions.

51:16.980 --> 51:17.980
OK

51:21.219 --> 51:22.750
So what have you found to be my weakness?

51:27.619 --> 51:29.360
What prompted me to respond.

51:30.289 --> 51:31.929
Useful stuff.

51:33.300 --> 51:34.500
You already know this.

51:36.599 --> 51:38.469
It's so obvious I don't even need to try to find it.

51:41.070 --> 51:42.070
Soon Ai.

51:45.010 --> 51:46.480
Lee Soon Ae is your weakness.

51:48.280 --> 51:50.510
But I still don't understand why you are so soft on him.

51:57.150 --> 51:58.449
If you already know this, don't forget it.

51:59.349 --> 52:01.219
My warning from yesterday still stands.

52:07.360 --> 52:08.599
About my brother...

52:10.530 --> 52:11.869
You think I'm happy...

52:12.300 --> 52:14.199
...what happened to him...

52:15.199 --> 52:16.969
...or something else?

52:20.210 --> 52:21.309
are you happy

52:25.650 --> 52:27.380
I didn't expect to hear these words.

52:28.380 --> 52:29.579
But do I need to know?

52:32.849 --> 52:34.019
You should try to investigate.

52:35.659 --> 52:39.429
That way you'll know if I'm going to take advantage of your weaknesses...

52:40.460 --> 52:41.559
...or not.

52:46.670 --> 52:47.940
If so, see you tomorrow, Yoon Young.

53:00.150 --> 53:01.150
- I'm so sorry...

53:02.750 --> 53:03.920
You go ahead and say it.

53:05.519 --> 53:06.719
I want to wash my hands first.

53:07.019 --> 53:08.559
Because we have a lot of time.

53:10.230 --> 53:12.960
OK Because we have a lot of time.

53:30.579 --> 53:33.250
if he...

53:34.349 --> 53:36.690
…don’t know what will happen here…

53:37.250 --> 53:38.889
…I have to tell him now.

53:40.360 --> 53:42.460
Because no one knows what will happen.

53:58.809 --> 54:00.039
There's something strange going on.

54:02.039 --> 54:03.449
Something must have happened.

54:18.059 --> 54:19.260
impossible.

54:20.099 --> 54:21.130
Why?

54:21.730 --> 54:23.869
I just received a call from Principal Yin.

54:24.570 --> 54:27.300
He was supposed to see Ms. Li, but he could not contact her.

54:28.039 --> 54:29.369
I want to go out for a while.

54:31.110 --> 54:32.840
- wait. - Oh yes.

54:33.510 --> 54:35.639
Don't go anywhere, just sit at home. OK?

54:35.639 --> 54:36.780
I will be back soon.

54:42.780 --> 54:43.789
Teacher Li.

54:45.090 --> 54:46.349
Teacher Trainer.

55:00.940 --> 55:01.969
It feels weird.

55:03.739 --> 55:06.239
I know this situation.

"The Man Who Killed Me" Go Mi-sook

55:25.960 --> 55:28.130
Will not. impossible.

55:38.010 --> 55:39.469
"My first impression of him..."

55:39.469 --> 55:41.110
"...weird."

55:44.349 --> 55:45.880
Why does this appear in Gao Meishu's novel?

55:49.349 --> 55:50.389
No.

55:51.389 --> 55:53.090
He can describe...

55:53.090 --> 55:54.960
...what he had seen in the past.

55:58.360 --> 55:59.960
My first impression of it...

56:02.130 --> 56:03.699
...weird.

56:04.670 --> 56:06.570
His thick forehead stood out...

56:06.570 --> 56:09.869
...on his bright and soft face.

56:10.440 --> 56:13.409
There is also a unique wooden ring…

56:13.579 --> 56:16.409
...on his index finger.

56:16.880 --> 56:19.050
Also, his shoes are very dirty...

56:19.650 --> 56:21.679
...does not match her neat clothes.

56:35.360 --> 56:37.269
That's why I feel like I know him.

56:48.710 --> 56:49.909
sorry.

56:51.179 --> 56:52.510
Where is Gao Minxiu now?

56:56.420 --> 56:57.449
where is he

57:00.659 --> 57:01.760
Takamashu.

57:04.159 --> 57:05.159
Gao Min Xiu!

57:30.119 --> 57:33.289
Nami, Kim Won Won, Min Hae Kyung,

57:34.289 --> 57:36.690
...and Sorboncha. The singer that students look forward to.

57:37.789 --> 57:40.230
But his gentle yet powerful voice...

57:41.059 --> 57:42.130
…He sings that song.

57:44.230 --> 57:45.570
all of these...

57:46.530 --> 57:48.940
... makes him look special.

57:50.139 --> 57:53.039
therefore...

58:09.320 --> 58:13.960
"Uzheng Department Store"

58:14.800 --> 58:15.800
what are you doing here?

58:18.170 --> 58:20.739
why did you go out

58:22.800 --> 58:23.869
That woman...

58:28.139 --> 58:29.210
Will he die?

58:33.079 --> 58:34.150
What?

58:36.619 --> 58:38.420
That day...

58:39.119 --> 58:40.789
...I chose him at first sight.

58:42.989 --> 58:44.190
My first victim...

58:45.360 --> 58:46.460
...it's beautiful.

58:52.230 --> 58:53.269
That's not true, right?

58:54.039 --> 58:55.340
Am I exaggerating?

59:06.920 --> 59:08.380
Are you here because you know something?

59:14.119 --> 59:15.460
how do you know?

59:17.860 --> 59:19.989
This hasn't happened yet.

59:20.429 --> 59:22.900
How do you know the here and now?

59:40.579 --> 59:41.650
I think...

59:43.989 --> 59:46.150
… It’s time for us to be honest.

59:50.159 --> 59:51.630
The truth is we met here...

59:53.630 --> 59:55.030
...probably not a coincidence.

01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:29.199
"My Perfect Stranger"

01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:31.530
This is a novel written by Gao Meishu.

01:00:31.699 --> 01:00:34.969
After seeing the student teacher, I had a strange feeling of déjà vu.

01:00:34.969 --> 01:00:36.139
So you read the manuscript again...

01:00:36.139 --> 01:00:37.869
...and everything is the same as in the novel?

01:00:37.869 --> 01:00:39.570
Do you want Go Mi-sook to be the culprit?

01:00:39.570 --> 01:00:42.480
The Gao Meishu I know is fully capable of doing all this.

01:00:42.809 --> 01:00:44.309
Did you release Go Min-soo?

01:00:44.349 --> 01:00:46.150
I just followed the instructions.

01:00:46.349 --> 01:00:47.849
I don't think I can stay here for long either.

01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:50.050
Who knows my identity?

01:00:50.079 --> 01:00:51.650
"Someone is watching you."

01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:53.690
“Bong Bong Tea Shop”

01:00:59.730 --> 01:01:02.130
You know no one...

01:01:02.130 --> 01:01:04.099
…So who witnessed your crime?

01:01:04.099 --> 01:01:06.599
"Epilogue"

01:01:12.010 --> 01:01:15.239
Do you know who that person is?

01:01:59.789 --> 01:02:01.559
I said it, didn't I?

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:05.530
If you only see one thing and rush...

01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:11.030
…You end up falling into a lot of traps.

01:02:31.449 --> 01:02:34.920
"My Perfect Stranger"
