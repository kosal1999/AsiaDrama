00:48.950 --> 00:52.090
This is the car that broke down last time, right?

00:52.289 --> 00:53.920
It's been repaired

00:54.090 --> 00:55.090
yes

00:55.160 --> 00:58.029
Oh, that's great. I'm so lucky.

00:59.389 --> 01:02.630
I see you guys are going out, so be careful on the road.

01:03.459 --> 01:04.499
Then let's do this first

01:25.520 --> 01:26.720
us

01:27.959 --> 01:29.759
How bad is the current situation?

01:31.459 --> 01:34.759
Well, this is also the first time I've encountered this.

01:34.929 --> 01:36.959
Shouldn't I be trapped here forever?

01:39.030 --> 01:40.569
Can't we go back?

01:41.240 --> 01:42.369
No way

01:43.300 --> 01:46.240
Don't worry, just fix it. It can be fixed.

01:46.309 --> 01:48.339
Just fix it. Just fix it.

01:52.149 --> 01:54.619
It'll be fine if it's fixed. It can be fixed.

01:55.479 --> 01:56.649
Let's go home first

02:30.419 --> 02:31.919
this time before

02:32.590 --> 02:35.120
I don't think there's any need to ask anything in particular.

02:36.919 --> 02:40.789
Because the existence of a time machine is ridiculous in the first place.

02:41.930 --> 02:43.829
no matter who made it

02:43.900 --> 02:45.900
Or even from the magic lamp

02:45.970 --> 02:48.199
I don't think it's a big deal

02:51.239 --> 02:52.810
This shouldn't be made by you, right?

02:57.039 --> 02:58.250
So where did this one come from?

03:00.680 --> 03:02.019
I picked it up

03:05.150 --> 03:06.350
Turns out I picked it up

03:08.889 --> 03:10.060
You actually

03:11.030 --> 03:12.329
I actually picked up a time machine

03:13.530 --> 03:15.030
The time machine turned out to be picked up

03:18.069 --> 03:19.630
He actually said he picked up a time machine

04:35.739 --> 04:36.879
Jiongwan

04:38.280 --> 04:40.049
Please don't mention my husband's name easily

04:41.249 --> 04:42.850
There is no need for us to meet with the chairman in the future.

04:42.919 --> 04:43.619
please leave

04:43.780 --> 04:45.150
I told you to go quickly

04:51.590 --> 04:52.689
sorry

04:54.260 --> 04:55.460
I'm really sorry for you

04:58.499 --> 04:59.830
It is my fault

05:02.799 --> 05:05.010
It's me who didn't teach my son well

05:06.609 --> 05:08.710
will harm you

05:11.280 --> 05:13.580
Lost a precious child just like that

05:15.419 --> 05:16.749
I also know no matter what

05:17.379 --> 05:19.189
I can't even get your forgiveness

05:20.150 --> 05:22.059
I can't give you any comfort

05:25.090 --> 05:26.660
I will hold the mood of atonement

05:28.030 --> 05:29.900
Spend the rest of your life

05:31.929 --> 05:34.470
I will definitely let myself

05:36.869 --> 05:38.640
Tortured every minute

05:48.720 --> 05:49.780
sorry

06:22.150 --> 06:23.919
can you really do it

06:25.590 --> 06:26.720
You really have a way

06:28.119 --> 06:30.619
Will you live a life of torture?

06:34.330 --> 06:35.400
i will do that

06:36.600 --> 06:38.030
I will let myself live like that

06:39.600 --> 06:41.369
I'm really sorry for you

06:41.669 --> 06:43.340
That bastard thing

06:43.770 --> 06:46.010
I hope they are a family

06:47.169 --> 06:50.239
Can live in dire straits for the rest of his life

06:57.479 --> 07:00.249
No matter how incompetent your child is,

07:02.760 --> 07:04.760
But I have to uncover the child’s scars with my own hands

07:06.090 --> 07:07.789
How difficult is it

07:08.999 --> 07:10.400
I know it too

07:13.600 --> 07:15.570
I'm grateful to you for that.

07:54.739 --> 07:55.809
even so

07:57.140 --> 07:58.780
Fortunately, I have a place to come back to.

08:03.220 --> 08:04.950
How about we just get drunk today?

08:06.090 --> 08:07.720
Anyway, there’s nothing left to do tonight

08:11.260 --> 08:12.989
- Eat more - Okay

08:20.830 --> 08:22.100
I thought it was all fixed

08:22.169 --> 08:23.340
It turned out not to be the case

08:25.239 --> 08:26.609
It's not all bad

08:27.939 --> 08:30.939
Anyway, once I go back

08:31.710 --> 08:33.379
Have to go to work soon

08:35.119 --> 08:36.350
At least if you continue to stay here

08:37.149 --> 08:38.149
You don’t have to suffer that 6:30 in the morning

08:38.220 --> 08:39.850
35 minutes 40 minutes

08:41.859 --> 08:44.619
The alarm that rings every 5 minutes is disturbing.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.560
Not bad

08:48.859 --> 08:50.560
I can also see my mother in her youth a few more times

08:51.570 --> 08:53.200
Take more breaths of fresh air

08:56.040 --> 08:57.639
Hagfish even sells for only 2,000 won

08:58.570 --> 08:59.970
You can’t even come up with 2,000 won

09:01.940 --> 09:03.580
Are you trying to draw a clear line with me now?

09:04.009 --> 09:05.249
Aren't you still here?

09:08.149 --> 09:11.180
In fact, the money I prepared is almost gone.

09:12.720 --> 09:15.820
Because I didn't plan to stay so long

09:16.359 --> 09:17.960
I didn't expect to be trapped here either.

09:22.430 --> 09:23.460
Mark Six Lottery

09:23.899 --> 09:25.970
Don’t you have the winning numbers memorized?

09:28.170 --> 09:29.499
What do you think

09:34.779 --> 09:35.879
hateful

09:36.940 --> 09:38.909
What a useless conscience

09:44.350 --> 09:45.420
It doesn't matter

09:47.019 --> 09:48.920
Anyway, we are all able-bodied

09:53.290 --> 09:56.129
We even know the future direction

09:56.359 --> 09:57.830
You can definitely make a lot of money if you make up your mind.

09:57.899 --> 09:59.430
Are you still afraid of starving to death?

10:17.320 --> 10:18.590
but

10:21.489 --> 10:23.690
How could the time machine be picked up?

10:25.060 --> 10:26.560
Even walking on the roadside

10:26.629 --> 10:28.129
It’s hard to find 500 won coins

10:31.129 --> 10:32.729
I'm also very curious about this matter

10:35.570 --> 10:36.940
Then how did you pick it up?

10:43.210 --> 10:45.649
It was a day of pouring rain

10:49.149 --> 10:50.279
You've gone off course

10:50.350 --> 10:51.550
Searching again

10:52.090 --> 10:54.320
Not only did the navigation fail that day,

10:54.590 --> 10:56.359
My vision was blurry because of the rain.

10:57.119 --> 10:58.460
I was on the road where I didn't even know where I was.

10:58.529 --> 11:00.489
Been driving for a while

11:03.460 --> 11:05.070
Then we met

11:05.700 --> 11:07.300
Just in front of the old bridge

11:17.710 --> 11:19.879
Is it like being thrown in there?

11:19.979 --> 11:21.680
The car door is still open

11:21.850 --> 11:24.019
There was even a sign in the car that said

11:24.080 --> 11:27.220
Tell me to drive across the old bridge ahead or something like that

11:27.649 --> 11:31.060
and instructions for use

11:31.859 --> 11:34.529
I want you to drive past the one in front of you

11:37.499 --> 11:40.999
It's like I'm waiting to be discovered

11:43.700 --> 11:46.970
Now that I think about it, that's not the only thing that's strange.

11:49.080 --> 11:50.810
The day I bumped into you

11:51.550 --> 11:53.350
Do you remember what you asked me?

11:53.409 --> 11:54.279
That question about the phone

11:54.550 --> 11:57.320
This is not a car that can hit just about anywhere.

11:57.379 --> 11:58.920
Did you call anyone?

11:59.249 --> 12:00.920
You must have been beaten

12:01.720 --> 12:04.259
Usually inattentive while driving

12:04.320 --> 12:06.159
Isn't it more likely to cause an accident?

12:07.690 --> 12:09.430
What's strange

12:09.899 --> 12:12.830
Actually that day

12:12.999 --> 12:14.940
Someone really called me

12:22.139 --> 12:23.139
yes

12:25.710 --> 12:26.779
What did you say

12:27.350 --> 12:30.879
Only you can solve this matter from beginning to end

12:31.080 --> 12:32.149
What did you say

12:40.359 --> 12:42.200
But I had no idea at the time

12:42.259 --> 12:44.859
I just dismissed it as a strange call and ignored it.

12:45.529 --> 12:46.869
But no matter how I thought about it later, I felt that

12:46.930 --> 12:49.739
That's not what someone who knows nothing would say.

12:52.710 --> 12:54.310
Who could that person be?

12:56.109 --> 12:57.139
I don't know either

13:15.600 --> 13:16.830
Are you OK

13:17.259 --> 13:18.869
The pace of walking is a bit strange

13:20.600 --> 13:21.769
I'm fine

13:22.570 --> 13:24.440
You can’t apply for insurance claims here anyway.

13:26.570 --> 13:28.479
It seems this is not the first time I have heard this sentence

13:29.139 --> 13:30.540
I'm fine

13:30.840 --> 13:32.210
If I die here

13:32.279 --> 13:34.080
Things will become quite difficult to understand

13:41.019 --> 13:43.489
I felt really confused at that time.

13:44.460 --> 13:48.330
But to be honest, I'm not that confused now.

13:51.769 --> 13:54.170
Because there is someone I want to be with

14:00.409 --> 14:01.509
if

14:02.879 --> 14:04.639
If it's true

14:05.109 --> 14:06.810
Never find a way back

14:06.879 --> 14:09.649
I have to be trapped here for the rest of my life.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.389
I seem to be able to accept it, too.

14:14.090 --> 14:15.590
If you were with me

14:18.690 --> 14:19.729
Really

14:28.869 --> 14:30.200
how about you

14:31.139 --> 14:32.210
me

14:35.080 --> 14:36.779
It’s useless to say more

14:39.550 --> 14:40.879
Of course not

15:30.759 --> 15:33.100
It seems that your words and deeds are a little different from yesterday.

15:33.170 --> 15:34.170
what do you mean

15:34.229 --> 15:35.399
Didn't you say you don't care?

15:35.800 --> 15:36.639
Didn't you say that if I were here?

15:36.700 --> 15:38.540
Are you willing to stay here all your life?

15:38.609 --> 15:39.340
I thought the back of my head

15:39.409 --> 15:40.869
A hole is almost being seen through

15:40.940 --> 15:42.779
How many hours do you plan to stay here and watch?

15:42.940 --> 15:44.279
no

15:44.340 --> 15:48.210
I'm just curious if things are going well

15:48.350 --> 15:49.720
A person who is simply curious

15:49.779 --> 15:53.019
Will you sigh when you see me tilting my head?

15:53.649 --> 15:55.790
It seems that I am the only one who is sincere.

15:57.720 --> 15:59.859
Of course I really mean it too.

16:00.290 --> 16:01.460
But now that it’s like this

16:01.999 --> 16:05.529
It would be better to meet in 2021

16:06.200 --> 16:08.129
Can we still rely on modern civilization

16:16.409 --> 16:18.279
Sorry, I won't watch it anymore

16:21.749 --> 16:24.149
But can you leave the door a crack?

16:31.790 --> 16:32.830
knew

16:34.790 --> 16:37.300
I know, I'm leaving now

16:38.700 --> 16:39.899
I'm going in

16:50.139 --> 16:51.810
This book has been selling very well recently

16:51.879 --> 16:53.249
- Really? - Yeah

16:53.909 --> 16:55.920
- It must be interesting. - That's right.

16:55.979 --> 16:57.950
- Do you want to buy a copy and take it back? - Okay

17:04.220 --> 17:05.859
Oh, thank you. Welcome back.

17:05.930 --> 17:07.960
- Thank you, you're welcome

17:18.669 --> 17:22.040
I've already seen it

17:22.879 --> 17:24.080
I think it looks good

17:24.609 --> 17:27.250
Your writing is not bad

17:27.980 --> 17:29.980
Please sign your name on the cover for me later

17:32.419 --> 17:34.820
Are you feeling better?

17:36.060 --> 17:38.730
It's okay now that I'm here

17:40.230 --> 17:43.129
That lunatic should have been caught sooner

17:45.060 --> 17:46.199
but

17:46.770 --> 17:50.300
Why don't you come to school since you've been discharged from the hospital?

17:51.000 --> 17:52.570
Is it because of our relationship?

17:52.969 --> 17:54.409
it's not like that

17:56.480 --> 17:58.040
Then it's time to go to school

17:59.310 --> 18:00.510
Come back soon

18:01.050 --> 18:04.379
Teachers and classmates are waiting for you

18:04.980 --> 18:06.219
Thanks

18:08.490 --> 18:11.159
See you at school then

18:11.290 --> 18:13.429
Meet Lee Soon Ae at school

18:24.939 --> 18:27.109
In the past, I only heard them asking me to meet at school.

18:27.169 --> 18:28.780
I feel so scared

18:29.580 --> 18:31.580
It seems like it really doesn't matter now

18:34.909 --> 18:36.050
that's great

18:39.919 --> 18:40.919
correct

18:43.119 --> 18:44.459
I've prepared a gift for you

18:55.570 --> 18:57.000
Is it the official printed version?

18:59.310 --> 19:00.409
"Lee Soon Ae"

19:02.240 --> 19:04.409
The name is also printed clearly

19:07.149 --> 19:08.280
sign your name for me

19:08.919 --> 19:10.449
Signed long ago

19:11.850 --> 19:12.919
Open the first page and take a look

19:24.699 --> 19:26.629
"To my best friend"

19:27.300 --> 19:30.540
"Only my Y Yunying"

19:43.149 --> 19:44.280
Thank you

19:46.619 --> 19:48.149
Really thank you very much

19:50.619 --> 19:52.730
This is the greatest gift in my life

20:11.379 --> 20:13.909
Do you really know something before you fix it?

20:16.320 --> 20:18.550
If that were the case, I would have fixed it long ago.

20:19.850 --> 20:21.350
How does that go

20:22.959 --> 20:25.830
The rest of the procedure should go smoothly.

20:26.359 --> 20:29.629
The chairman seems to have given an explanation

20:29.899 --> 20:32.030
Make him admit everything and pay the price

20:32.230 --> 20:33.500
It seems that's what he told your dad.

20:36.840 --> 20:39.810
The chairman is having a hard time now

20:40.439 --> 20:42.109
What else is needed at this time?

20:42.879 --> 20:44.080
What we need most is family.

20:45.340 --> 20:48.480
But from now on he will be left alone

21:24.949 --> 21:27.050
Why do you open the door so wide?

21:28.149 --> 21:29.189
Haijun

21:31.990 --> 21:34.260
Haven't you seen what people outside are doing?

21:35.030 --> 21:37.600
What should you do if someone comes in and hurts you? It's too dangerous.

21:38.300 --> 21:40.730
Who else in this village can be better than my son?

21:41.699 --> 21:42.800
More dangerous

21:49.080 --> 21:50.609
I thought you had gone back

21:52.810 --> 21:55.409
Thought you had enough of yours

21:56.219 --> 21:57.649
The so-called family members who do all kinds of evil

21:58.480 --> 22:00.990
Just leave without saying goodbye

22:01.290 --> 22:04.260
I would have done this if I could

22:09.760 --> 22:11.500
thank you for not doing that

22:12.830 --> 22:16.399
I always hope to see you one last time

22:19.270 --> 22:20.810
Don't you hate me?

22:21.340 --> 22:24.040
Because of me, you are going through things that you don’t have to go through.

22:25.909 --> 22:27.879
Don't even know how long this will last

22:29.820 --> 22:32.389
Just because I'm worried that you might think this way

22:33.389 --> 22:36.419
So I want to meet you again

22:37.119 --> 22:38.590
Want to tell you I'm okay

22:39.490 --> 22:41.159
On the contrary, thank you very much

22:43.030 --> 22:44.659
I really want to tell you this

22:49.199 --> 22:50.669
Thanks to you

22:51.300 --> 22:53.469
Now I can at least make things right

22:56.679 --> 22:58.010
Really sorry

22:59.810 --> 23:03.679
Let you see my shameful appearance

23:09.490 --> 23:11.219
I'm still thinking

23:12.119 --> 23:15.629
How long do I need to wait before I can tell you this?

23:17.899 --> 23:21.129
Fortunately I could tell you 30 years in advance

23:23.169 --> 23:24.340
What a blessing

23:36.679 --> 23:37.850
where did you go

23:40.219 --> 23:41.689
Went to meet someone

23:56.000 --> 23:57.939
Why are you so listless?

24:03.780 --> 24:05.010
us

24:06.449 --> 24:08.149
Can be done in the blink of an eye

24:08.550 --> 24:10.919
span 30 years

24:13.389 --> 24:15.090
But it made me realize

24:16.590 --> 24:18.119
Some people have to endure it

24:18.520 --> 24:20.859
every day for these 30 years

24:25.730 --> 24:27.469
Did you go to see your grandpa?

24:33.469 --> 24:35.540
I'm not regretting what we did

24:35.879 --> 24:38.379
I know and understand

24:50.760 --> 24:52.889
Maybe this will be our chance

24:55.389 --> 24:57.699
Although we can't go back right now

24:58.030 --> 25:01.070
But that means more time here

25:02.969 --> 25:06.369
How about spending time like we didn't have before.

25:06.709 --> 25:08.639
"A time we didn't have before"

25:10.280 --> 25:13.010
In other words, the time that I wanted to have but couldn’t.

25:13.949 --> 25:17.379
Because I saw them again 30 years later

25:18.649 --> 25:20.990
So create a beautiful memory for them

25:21.050 --> 25:22.250
It should be fine

25:40.270 --> 25:41.570
do you like fishing

25:44.139 --> 25:46.050
i know a good place

25:46.510 --> 25:47.780
But I don’t want to go alone

25:51.649 --> 25:53.550
Do you know what my original dream was?

25:54.820 --> 25:57.459
Live an ordinary life and have an ordinary job

25:58.119 --> 26:00.159
alone after retirement

26:00.760 --> 26:04.199
Just spend your whole life fishing leisurely like this

26:05.260 --> 26:06.369
Are you alone

26:07.169 --> 26:09.340
Don’t you have family or children?

26:10.770 --> 26:11.869
may be

26:15.540 --> 26:16.840
Too

26:17.580 --> 26:19.179
For you

26:19.949 --> 26:21.149
My family is not impressed

26:24.780 --> 26:27.050
But something seems to have changed now

26:29.320 --> 26:31.760
I hope someone can stay with me

26:33.389 --> 26:35.330
We can talk and laugh together

26:36.000 --> 26:37.230
You can also ask for help

26:38.659 --> 26:40.199
I also want to live that kind of life

26:41.500 --> 26:43.369
Of course life is like that

26:43.439 --> 26:45.169
You can definitely have that life

26:46.070 --> 26:47.369
can i really do that

26:47.439 --> 26:49.139
of course

26:49.310 --> 26:52.550
If you decide you want to live that life

26:53.679 --> 26:56.219
I will do my best to help you

26:56.949 --> 26:59.050
Then I beg you

26:59.119 --> 27:00.149
"Plea"

27:00.820 --> 27:02.419
Reduce your alcohol intake as soon as possible

27:02.689 --> 27:04.659
If you don’t want to take those nasty medicines all the time

27:06.159 --> 27:08.429
Remember to eat on time

27:09.330 --> 27:12.899
Start regular health check-ups after 8 years

27:15.500 --> 27:16.540
OK

27:17.169 --> 27:18.000
Just no more worries

27:18.070 --> 27:20.810
Only then can I live a life of talking and laughing

27:22.580 --> 27:25.639
Apart from these things that are good to me

27:26.679 --> 27:29.750
Didn't you ask me to do it for you?

27:31.219 --> 27:34.389
Just take me fishing occasionally

27:36.359 --> 27:38.619
The first time I went fishing was with my seniors after I joined the company

27:38.689 --> 27:40.030
Found it suits me very well

27:40.730 --> 27:43.159
At that time, I thought it would be great to know earlier.

27:44.530 --> 27:46.100
If you feel good today

27:46.169 --> 27:48.070
You can bring me here early

27:53.209 --> 27:54.840
The real fun is night fishing

27:54.909 --> 27:56.240
You can also cook ramen and eat it

28:01.780 --> 28:02.850
alright

28:05.419 --> 28:07.750
- Here you go - Thank you

28:09.189 --> 28:10.219
Blow it

28:22.429 --> 28:24.369
That's good

28:25.000 --> 28:26.669
But is this enough?

28:28.169 --> 28:30.409
that's enough for me

28:34.780 --> 28:36.619
Oh my god float

28:37.280 --> 28:39.619
Grandpa, I told you to wait a while

28:39.689 --> 28:41.189
But the float has moved

28:41.250 --> 28:42.290
Didn't move at all

28:42.350 --> 28:44.820
The beauty of fishing is to be patient and let it go

28:47.330 --> 28:50.899
Okay, we'll come back when we get there.

28:51.060 --> 28:53.530
The last person to arrive wants to buy spicy rice cakes

28:53.629 --> 28:55.399
Then let's go

28:57.800 --> 29:00.169
Even the foul is so cute

29:03.240 --> 29:04.340
What are you doing

29:06.379 --> 29:07.379
I won't

29:07.980 --> 29:09.649
What should I say louder?

29:11.850 --> 29:13.149
I can't ride a bicycle

29:28.770 --> 29:31.169
You two go ahead and leave me alone.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.609
How can I not ride a bicycle at this age?

29:36.639 --> 29:38.939
Why didn't your father even teach you this?

29:40.149 --> 29:41.409
He can't ride either

29:42.149 --> 29:43.580
His legs are a bit inconvenient

29:44.679 --> 29:45.780
Yeah

29:47.850 --> 29:48.990
if

29:51.119 --> 29:52.419
If he's okay

29:54.830 --> 29:57.260
Do you want to teach me this too?

29:57.730 --> 29:59.830
As a father, who doesn’t want to teach his children to ride a bicycle?

30:00.969 --> 30:03.600
Whenever I see

30:03.899 --> 30:05.840
He must be very sad that someone else is teaching their children.

30:07.340 --> 30:08.969
I would think "I really want to teach"

30:09.109 --> 30:11.040
"I really want to teach my daughter"

30:16.580 --> 30:17.719
do not worry

30:18.520 --> 30:19.949
Let me teach you

30:20.750 --> 30:24.060
Put your feet on the pedal first and put them up first

30:25.359 --> 30:27.689
Then step hard and don’t have any worries

30:27.929 --> 30:29.760
Even if you shake and feel like you're going to fall

30:30.060 --> 30:33.230
You must never stop and keep moving forward.

30:33.730 --> 30:35.129
What if I do fall?

30:35.199 --> 30:37.899
No, I'll be right behind you, don't worry

30:38.000 --> 30:39.070
let us start

30:39.939 --> 30:42.270
Don't let go suddenly, don't let go

31:02.760 --> 31:05.399
Oops, her exercise cells are too bad, right?

31:09.070 --> 31:12.340
This is her first time riding. You should keep supporting her.

31:13.070 --> 31:15.169
How can I let go?

31:17.010 --> 31:19.379
To learn well, you have to train rigorously from the beginning

31:22.080 --> 31:23.580
What are you talking about?

31:25.020 --> 31:27.250
What to do if you leave a scar

31:27.649 --> 31:29.990
I was wrong and sorry

31:30.790 --> 31:32.219
Hate

31:33.689 --> 31:35.230
- It makes me sad. - I was wrong.

31:35.290 --> 31:36.859
- Do you know you are wrong - I was wrong

31:38.030 --> 31:41.070
I thought why it was so strange

31:41.129 --> 31:44.070
It turns out this is time I've never spent before

31:44.139 --> 31:46.139
- Do you know that you are wrong? - I know that you are wrong.

31:46.209 --> 31:48.270
in my changed future

31:49.480 --> 31:51.379
Can record more

31:52.639 --> 31:54.750
Is this kind of memory?

31:54.810 --> 31:58.250
The little frog is singing

31:58.320 --> 32:02.020
Children, grandchildren, and daughters-in-law gathered together

32:07.189 --> 32:08.889
It would be nice if that was the case

32:10.330 --> 32:13.070
It would be great if that was really the case

32:20.969 --> 32:22.669
The Yunying one

32:23.209 --> 32:24.679
Do you want to take a bite of the long rice cake?

32:25.280 --> 32:26.209
No need for me to do it myself

32:27.310 --> 32:29.280
I'll feed you

32:31.050 --> 32:31.850
Open your mouth quickly

32:31.919 --> 32:33.790
Just accept his apology.

32:36.760 --> 32:38.959
Just say it doesn't matter. Really?

32:46.030 --> 32:47.969
How delicious is it?

32:48.469 --> 32:50.600
I feed you, so it tastes better, right?

32:51.070 --> 32:52.369
It's inherently delicious

32:57.840 --> 33:00.980
The rice cake is chewy and delicious.

33:24.639 --> 33:26.169
Who is he and why is he at the door of our Teacher Yin’s house?

33:26.240 --> 33:27.740
probing

33:52.500 --> 33:54.629
Didn’t I ask you not to come for a while?

33:54.699 --> 33:55.600
Why are you here?

33:55.669 --> 33:58.070
I know you are having a hard time now, how could I not come?

33:58.300 --> 33:59.199
In the past I have also suffered

33:59.270 --> 34:00.909
Chairman, you are very helpful.

34:01.969 --> 34:04.480
- Please come in. - Thank you very much.

34:12.150 --> 34:14.520
Can you let me know before you leave?

34:15.350 --> 34:17.389
OK I will

34:18.860 --> 34:21.489
Okay, then I'll wait for your news

34:22.130 --> 34:24.900
Okay, come in quickly

34:45.449 --> 34:46.619
Oops

34:48.850 --> 34:51.060
What should I do with that car?

35:02.199 --> 35:05.369
We finally met here

35:07.239 --> 35:08.310
Who are you

35:08.770 --> 35:10.779
so sad

35:11.339 --> 35:13.080
I thought you would recognize me right away

35:14.750 --> 35:16.179
Don’t you remember my voice?

35:17.049 --> 35:18.449
“This thing starts and ends.”

35:18.520 --> 35:20.690
"Only you can solve it"

35:23.089 --> 35:24.920
old bridge telephone

35:26.730 --> 35:28.589
What did you say?

35:28.659 --> 35:32.259
Only you can solve this matter from beginning to end

35:35.369 --> 35:37.000
I knew you would remember

35:37.239 --> 35:38.199
because you are smart

35:38.270 --> 35:40.139
It only takes 5 seconds to solve the twisting dice

35:40.210 --> 35:41.839
Do you know who I am

35:46.239 --> 35:47.580
How could I not know

35:50.179 --> 35:51.319
Where is my father?

35:52.750 --> 35:53.889
What did you say

36:02.029 --> 36:03.659
I miss your dad very much

36:08.170 --> 36:10.270
But are you giving me the time machine I gave you?

36:10.339 --> 36:11.569
broken

36:35.060 --> 36:37.330
Are you happy going fishing with your grandpa?

36:37.429 --> 36:38.529
Um

36:39.730 --> 36:41.400
Come with me next time too

36:41.770 --> 36:44.199
I also learned to ride a bicycle now

36:44.469 --> 36:47.110
The scenery we went to today is very good

36:47.409 --> 36:49.469
So I want to go with you again

36:49.980 --> 36:52.179
Is that where it won’t be in 2021?

36:52.839 --> 36:54.049
There should be

37:02.350 --> 37:04.020
Has the car been repaired?

37:05.420 --> 37:06.560
Maybe

37:09.330 --> 37:10.199
Had known so

37:10.259 --> 37:12.429
I won’t make an appointment with them to see you tomorrow.

37:15.270 --> 37:17.369
There's no need to go back now

37:19.639 --> 37:20.670
No

37:21.239 --> 37:23.540
Anyway, we are the ones who can’t appear here.

37:23.909 --> 37:25.580
No matter what, it has to disappear

37:26.580 --> 37:28.679
And we will meet again soon after we go back

37:31.949 --> 37:33.319
And you

37:34.920 --> 37:38.719
Is it really okay to go back like this now?

38:24.639 --> 38:25.739
how could you

38:27.009 --> 38:28.969
know i'm here

38:29.139 --> 38:31.040
Sorry to come to you suddenly

38:33.080 --> 38:35.949
I won't tell anyone else you're here

38:36.779 --> 38:38.880
I will also forget it from now on

38:43.759 --> 38:45.060
can i sit down

39:15.750 --> 39:19.560
Do we really have to send the child away after he is born?

39:20.089 --> 39:22.029
Send it to Chairman Yoon Byeong-qiu

39:27.029 --> 39:28.029
right

39:29.270 --> 39:30.739
I already said I would do this

39:32.270 --> 39:34.909
Because you think that child is scary and disgusting?

39:37.210 --> 39:38.339
right

39:48.350 --> 39:49.449
All right

39:50.659 --> 39:53.529
Then live a good life

39:55.190 --> 39:57.600
Don't feel any guilt

39:58.630 --> 40:00.369
Forget everything and live your life

40:05.500 --> 40:07.310
Don’t I understand your difficulties very well?

40:09.239 --> 40:12.040
It's understandable that you would feel disgusted and frightened.

40:14.650 --> 40:15.449
So if you feel very painful

40:15.509 --> 40:17.949
You don’t have to live with your children

40:19.989 --> 40:21.290
i can understand

40:23.420 --> 40:25.119
Chairman Yin Bingqiu

40:25.619 --> 40:27.589
Very rich and a good man

40:27.960 --> 40:29.730
This is also a good thing for children

40:30.659 --> 40:34.369
Living in a rich family has everything you need

40:35.730 --> 40:37.170
This is how he will be raised

40:38.540 --> 40:40.639
I won’t feel resentment towards my mother.

40:41.969 --> 40:43.739
There will be no complaints

40:45.739 --> 40:47.210
He will grow up like this

40:50.420 --> 40:51.580
Lie

40:53.080 --> 40:54.790
How could you not blame me?

40:55.719 --> 40:57.489
How could you not resent me?

40:58.219 --> 40:59.819
I abandoned him

41:01.389 --> 41:04.759
After all, I am a mother who abandoned her children

41:07.330 --> 41:08.929
Just believe me

41:09.900 --> 41:11.639
Didn’t you say your name is the same as mine?

41:14.540 --> 41:16.909
That kid's thoughts will be similar to mine.

41:18.980 --> 41:20.250
real

41:21.909 --> 41:23.110
will it be so

41:26.049 --> 41:28.790
It was you who brought him into this world

41:30.960 --> 41:34.560
This alone is a favor enough

41:41.029 --> 41:42.699
He would think so

42:03.589 --> 42:04.889
Are you in a good mood?

42:06.159 --> 42:07.259
Um

42:08.529 --> 42:11.400
This time it’s my turn to send away the person who abandoned me

42:12.000 --> 42:13.969
I feel inexplicably relaxed

42:16.330 --> 42:19.170
Then you can really go back now, right?

42:19.940 --> 42:21.009
right

42:25.710 --> 42:28.009
But it was really repaired this time, right?

42:28.080 --> 42:30.179
Should I go back to see the chairman again?

42:30.880 --> 42:31.949
Will not

42:32.850 --> 42:35.389
Because this time a real repairman showed up

42:36.150 --> 42:37.259
Has anyone been here?

42:37.589 --> 42:39.759
The person who called me under the old bridge at that time

42:42.029 --> 42:43.630
That's the person who built this time machine.

42:46.900 --> 42:48.699
I couldn't believe it at first

42:49.270 --> 42:51.500
I don't think that person can exist

42:52.839 --> 42:53.969
How can it be

42:54.940 --> 42:55.610
how could i

42:55.670 --> 42:57.380
How can I have a son?

42:57.980 --> 43:00.250
You will obviously die in 2022

43:02.080 --> 43:03.619
Because you're not dead at all

43:04.480 --> 43:06.750
Although it is true that he almost died

43:07.619 --> 43:08.889
But he survived in the end

43:12.860 --> 43:16.460
Because there is a key there that you have overlooked

43:18.560 --> 43:20.600
appeared in that hidden future

43:22.500 --> 43:23.600
it's me

43:27.339 --> 43:29.610
I always wanted to give you another chance

43:30.839 --> 43:32.779
An opportunity to make different choices

43:34.009 --> 43:35.049
And you

43:36.650 --> 43:38.150
Sure enough we did it

43:42.850 --> 43:45.060
There is a future there that I don’t know about

43:45.619 --> 43:48.130
These things happened because of that future

43:51.429 --> 43:52.860
So who is that person?

43:55.369 --> 43:56.630
secret

43:58.299 --> 43:59.569
Are you really not going to say it?

44:03.480 --> 44:04.540
Let's go

44:19.690 --> 44:20.960
Just one step away now

44:22.130 --> 44:23.230
yes

44:24.060 --> 44:26.900
Thanks to some unknown benefactor, I can go back

44:31.040 --> 44:32.969
There were still a lot of good times during this period, right?

44:34.569 --> 44:36.239
There must be a lot of grateful moments

44:36.909 --> 44:38.580
It's also because you are here

44:42.380 --> 44:43.920
But after going back

44:45.150 --> 44:46.719
Will this really change?

44:48.350 --> 44:50.049
What should I do if I leave it intact?

44:51.290 --> 44:52.819
Go back quickly to confirm

44:54.659 --> 44:55.830
are you ready

44:58.330 --> 45:01.230
See you in the future

45:04.940 --> 45:08.369
Well, see you in 34 years

46:35.860 --> 46:38.130
- Hello - Has Haejun arrived safely?

46:38.360 --> 46:39.630
I kept you waiting for a long time

46:40.929 --> 46:42.500
I arrived grandpa

46:44.839 --> 46:45.869
good

47:14.170 --> 47:15.330
Pick it up quickly

47:28.049 --> 47:29.049
Hello

47:35.489 --> 47:36.949
Is mom really you?

47:41.630 --> 47:43.029
That's how we are

47:43.529 --> 47:45.400
Back to the future safely

47:57.909 --> 47:59.310
our present

48:00.409 --> 48:02.750
Really changed a lot

48:04.480 --> 48:05.580
Home

48:08.819 --> 48:10.020
changed

49:12.219 --> 49:13.619
Yunying

49:16.889 --> 49:17.960
This guy

49:23.560 --> 49:24.630
Really

49:24.699 --> 49:27.600
where have you been

49:32.500 --> 49:34.040
I went to see my mother

49:35.540 --> 49:36.540
What

49:36.639 --> 49:39.179
What is she talking about?

49:39.239 --> 49:42.310
Waiting for me to disappear without a trace

49:43.279 --> 49:44.750
Parents who have been waiting for a month

49:44.819 --> 49:46.779
Worried me to death

49:46.850 --> 49:50.219
Became what I had seen in my dreams

49:52.060 --> 49:54.589
- Smelly girl - don't hit her

50:38.839 --> 50:40.839
For more than thirty years

50:41.069 --> 50:43.610
He who is always waiting for me

50:45.040 --> 50:47.409
Didn't forget our agreement

50:50.520 --> 50:51.580
Haijun

51:07.029 --> 51:08.029
but me

51:08.969 --> 51:11.699
Finally met the writer of my dreams

51:13.040 --> 51:14.770
became her editor

51:16.670 --> 51:17.710
Mother

51:18.440 --> 51:20.850
I think this sentence needs to be deleted.

51:23.150 --> 51:24.219
I do not want it

51:24.779 --> 51:26.219
If you want to review the manuscript like this

51:26.279 --> 51:27.150
Just write your own novel

51:29.949 --> 51:31.089
Acting stubborn again

51:31.619 --> 51:33.489
He's becoming more and more stubborn

51:33.560 --> 51:36.489
I mean, go ahead and write your own novel.

51:38.199 --> 51:39.259
Wife

51:40.830 --> 51:42.500
Do you want to give it to her?

51:43.730 --> 51:44.839
for you

51:48.139 --> 51:49.339
Quite interesting

52:08.730 --> 52:10.060
Don't make trouble

52:21.409 --> 52:22.409
besides

52:23.069 --> 52:24.880
Dad, please be quiet and stop playing.

52:24.940 --> 52:28.080
I loved last Sunday at 9pm

52:28.150 --> 52:29.449
Hello everyone, viewers

52:29.509 --> 52:32.719
What you are watching now is "KSBC 9 o'clock news"

52:32.949 --> 52:35.020
Under investigation Songhuan Group Chairman Zhao Mingshi

52:35.089 --> 52:37.089
Prosecutors suspected of bribery

52:37.389 --> 52:39.089
Today, for Songhuan Group Corporation

52:39.159 --> 52:41.929
and 8 related companies to launch seizures

52:42.089 --> 52:43.389
Looks similar

52:44.400 --> 52:46.960
The biggest doubt is to transfer company funds

52:47.029 --> 52:48.069
Hee-seop

52:48.969 --> 52:49.799
elder brother

52:50.969 --> 52:52.040
Hello uncle

52:53.469 --> 52:54.909
There are no guests today

52:54.969 --> 52:57.270
This is a retro bar, so

52:57.339 --> 52:58.980
- Mastered 4 billion won - Dad

52:59.040 --> 53:00.909
size of funds

53:00.980 --> 53:03.150
Evidence of transfer to the name of Chairman Cho Myung-seok

53:03.210 --> 53:06.250
The details will be reported by reporter Kim Woo-hyun

53:22.670 --> 53:23.670
Let's go

53:27.100 --> 53:30.339
It feels so strange walking here, right?

53:31.040 --> 53:32.139
Feel better

53:32.679 --> 53:34.750
Hold hands whenever and wherever you want

53:35.250 --> 53:37.009
Don’t be afraid of speaking

53:38.750 --> 53:41.790
By the way, did your parents say anything when they saw me?

53:43.089 --> 53:44.319
How could I not say it?

53:44.920 --> 53:46.460
Whenever they see the news they say

53:46.520 --> 53:48.360
You look a lot like their old school teacher

53:48.429 --> 53:50.630
Even the sound is exactly the same

53:50.699 --> 53:52.259
I feel incredible

53:53.460 --> 53:55.799
Your daughter is also quite suspicious, right?

53:57.230 --> 53:58.369
They were indeed suspicious

54:01.069 --> 54:02.610
Let's get started

54:02.670 --> 54:05.239
OMG the long rice cake looks so delicious

54:05.940 --> 54:07.850
come to you

54:08.009 --> 54:10.380
- Oh my god. Please use this.

54:10.449 --> 54:11.520
Eat

54:15.949 --> 54:17.690
It really tastes the same as what I’ve had before.

54:18.360 --> 54:21.330
We were with Yunying at that time

54:21.389 --> 54:24.199
The same day I was riding a bicycle in the park

54:30.199 --> 54:32.170
It’s been 30 years

54:32.239 --> 54:35.839
There's a friend your mother still misses

54:36.639 --> 54:39.440
That's why I named you after her

54:42.710 --> 54:43.850
I can't stand it

54:49.049 --> 54:52.560
But you look more and more like her as you get older

54:52.619 --> 54:54.389
I never thought something like this would happen

54:55.029 --> 54:57.429
It should have been when you were pregnant with me

54:57.500 --> 55:00.429
I think of that friend often, maybe it’s like that

55:01.670 --> 55:03.500
- Is it is it

55:04.569 --> 55:05.670
Oops

55:05.770 --> 55:07.369
Do they believe what you say?

55:08.409 --> 55:10.040
What if I don’t believe it?

55:10.639 --> 55:13.279
Even if we are the same as those 34 years ago

55:13.339 --> 55:15.009
Teacher and friend look exactly the same

55:15.610 --> 55:17.949
They never thought it was because of time travel

55:25.190 --> 55:26.560
A while ago

55:27.489 --> 55:30.029
I met that person by chance

56:11.699 --> 56:12.969
You won't do anything to yourself

56:13.799 --> 56:15.009
Do you regret it?

56:16.610 --> 56:17.710
Regret

56:20.880 --> 56:23.009
If you like it, just say you like it.

56:23.810 --> 56:25.719
If it hurts, just say it hurts

56:26.279 --> 56:28.150
If you're envious, just say envy.

56:29.190 --> 56:31.389
If only I were more candid too

56:35.190 --> 56:36.730
Because I couldn't do that

56:38.100 --> 56:40.130
Because it's too late

56:44.869 --> 56:47.540
Maybe I will live forever

56:49.509 --> 56:51.239
The days of wandering among the crowd

56:57.080 --> 56:58.850
It's never too late

57:00.779 --> 57:02.389
Because now

57:03.690 --> 57:05.520
To you in the future, it’s the past

57:10.029 --> 57:11.159
Is that so?

57:30.250 --> 57:32.850
Although I don't know how she is doing now

57:33.819 --> 57:35.319
but i think maybe

57:36.449 --> 57:39.460
she has become more outspoken

57:41.290 --> 57:42.860
but me

57:43.630 --> 57:45.830
Still living on the same side

57:46.299 --> 57:49.130
While thinking about the future and the past

58:01.009 --> 58:03.710
good night, see you tomorrow

58:03.779 --> 58:05.619
- It's been a lot of fun today - Yeah

58:05.980 --> 58:09.420
I can't look closer

58:09.489 --> 58:10.719
My mother's face?

58:10.989 --> 58:14.630
Let's talk about it later. If you see it now, you'll be in trouble.

58:14.690 --> 58:15.759
Why

58:17.489 --> 58:19.759
It wouldn’t be fun if the ending was spoiled.

58:22.029 --> 58:23.699
For the sake of our future relationship

58:30.409 --> 58:34.549
Sure enough, people who are destined to meet will eventually meet.

58:36.409 --> 58:38.819
After all, my parents meet again here

58:38.880 --> 58:42.520
fall in love again

58:44.150 --> 58:45.159
yes

58:47.489 --> 58:50.360
As far as you know, what's her favorite thing?

58:50.929 --> 58:53.060
Now that you know everything, give me some tips.

58:53.699 --> 58:56.069
So that I can prepare the gifts I will give later

58:58.369 --> 58:59.540
It's you

59:00.569 --> 59:04.069
What my mother likes most in the world is you

59:05.080 --> 59:08.580
And the bouquet of flowers you occasionally give her

59:09.210 --> 59:10.779
That really made her happy

59:34.770 --> 59:37.339
- what is this - a gift

59:42.949 --> 59:44.049
I love so much

59:45.850 --> 59:47.219
I love it

59:48.190 --> 59:49.949
Are you too easy to dismiss?

59:50.350 --> 59:52.290
This little thing makes you so happy

59:53.420 --> 59:56.060
I already have this gift from you, why should I give it to you again?

01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:03.600
- That's - my gift.

01:00:07.810 --> 01:00:11.080
Is that time machine no longer usable?

01:00:11.909 --> 01:00:14.339
I can only run back and forth one more time

01:00:14.549 --> 01:00:15.710
Anywhere

01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:22.619
Did you know that tomorrow is May 16th?

01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:26.960
It seems we think the same thing

01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:29.259
if

01:00:30.730 --> 01:00:34.060
What if I just make this trip?

01:00:35.199 --> 01:00:36.569
how do you feel

01:00:39.170 --> 01:00:41.310
It should be worth a try this time

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:46.839
Let's go one last time

01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:49.210
I have to try my best this time

01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:52.779
just in case

01:01:54.009 --> 01:01:55.949
What to do if variables occur

01:01:57.150 --> 01:02:00.980
Maybe the "future" will find us

01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:03.719
Because we will be together no matter what

01:02:06.690 --> 01:02:08.989
Our meeting was not by chance

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:12.060
But it is the fate that we must meet

01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:19.639
- Are you ready? - Okay

01:02:21.369 --> 01:02:22.540
lets go
