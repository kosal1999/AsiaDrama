"The Stranger I Met"
Episode 9

00:16.519 --> 00:19.049
(Wu Jindong)

00:28.860 --> 00:31.499
(Kyung Gi Joo)

00:40.770 --> 00:44.039
(a stranger I met)

00:45.679 --> 00:49.350
(past story)

00:51.020 --> 00:52.620
- Did you kill him?
- No

00:52.889 --> 00:53.950
no sir

00:54.259 --> 00:56.919
sir please give me a good life
i am not real

00:56.920 --> 00:58.590
I'm really not

01:03.899 --> 01:06.999
- It's not because I'm here
- It's me

01:07.270 --> 01:08.740
- No
- Let me in.

01:10.069 --> 01:12.169
Yesterday, it was almost impossible to tie a rope with fingers like this

01:12.970 --> 01:15.178
When the two victims
were discovered

01:15.179 --> 01:16.179
tied with red string

01:16.180 --> 01:17.439
he is a communist

01:17.440 --> 01:18.508
He said he didn't even meet him twice

01:18.509 --> 01:19.580
they will arrest me

01:21.020 --> 01:22.179
who I am?

01:23.119 --> 01:24.789
Where is this now?

01:26.949 --> 01:29.890
It really took me so long

01:30.259 --> 01:31.289
this is mine

01:31.530 --> 01:33.729
i did everything

01:34.059 --> 01:36.100
Can you hear such an answer?

01:37.770 --> 01:39.630
Everything has become different

01:41.940 --> 01:43.140
for me

01:43.770 --> 01:45.910
I can't understand it from beginning to end

01:46.470 --> 01:47.880
I don't want to understand

01:48.479 --> 01:50.440
A good person can be disappointed

01:51.050 --> 01:54.550
(Part 9,
I come from your darkest night)

01:55.979 --> 01:57.850
What do you mean, this is not the defendant

01:58.649 --> 02:00.250
I must have heard
the confession

02:08.130 --> 02:09.130
I heard about it

02:09.899 --> 02:11.899
The answer does not match the question at all

02:13.199 --> 02:16.340
The question I just asked was
"Why?"

02:19.169 --> 02:20.169
What's this?

02:20.509 --> 02:21.979
Why hide this here?

02:22.280 --> 02:23.638
But why?

02:23.639 --> 02:25.549
The answer that comes out
is mine

02:26.949 --> 02:27.979
this is mine

02:28.220 --> 02:30.049
Just something from his room

02:30.919 --> 02:32.319
No matter how fast it goes

02:32.650 --> 02:35.319
Would he admit such a thing without giving me the slightest excuse ?

02:35.960 --> 02:37.759
Even if he did what he did

02:38.030 --> 02:40.589
- man
- try to let go

02:40.590 --> 02:42.198
- I'm gonna kill that guy
- Man!

02:42.199 --> 02:44.258
- It won't change anything.
- Don't say that.

02:44.259 --> 02:45.798
- No one
- let me go

02:45.799 --> 02:47.199
- Dad, calm down.
- I'm here.

02:48.470 --> 02:49.669
What's wrong?

02:50.639 --> 02:53.810
Uncle Dongshi
put handcuffs on his nephew himself

02:54.410 --> 02:57.238
That guy killed my sister

02:57.239 --> 02:58.548
Let me go

02:58.549 --> 03:00.948
- Ha
- I'm going to kill that guy.

03:00.949 --> 03:03.018
- Don't be a father
- Calm down

03:03.019 --> 03:04.650
- I'll let that guy go
- No.

03:09.819 --> 03:11.229
Jesus said it was not him

03:11.590 --> 03:12.889
Absolutely not

03:19.870 --> 03:21.000
this

03:22.639 --> 03:23.769
is this real?

03:34.079 --> 03:35.079
How to do it?

03:36.919 --> 03:39.549
How can anyone else do it?

03:40.549 --> 03:42.620
you are you

03:44.989 --> 03:47.060
Why can't you kill someone?

03:55.840 --> 03:56.900
Killed?

03:58.440 --> 03:59.470
what is that?

03:59.539 --> 04:01.680
What's the use of pretending to be innocent here
?

04:02.009 --> 04:04.579
All the evidence points to you being the culprit.

04:10.280 --> 04:11.349
that matchbox

04:11.350 --> 04:12.489
(Girls in red clothes
are dangerous)

04:12.720 --> 04:13.750
and text

04:27.700 --> 04:30.270
Brother, what are these?

04:30.999 --> 04:34.210
Oh, nothing

04:36.479 --> 04:37.910
After cleaning the room

04:38.379 --> 04:39.479
let's go out to eat

04:44.689 --> 04:47.049
no no

04:47.789 --> 04:49.059
I'm not

04:49.359 --> 04:50.359
if not

04:52.489 --> 04:54.160
What's this?

04:56.929 --> 04:58.530
Whose is this?

05:18.890 --> 05:22.359
Last night, Hee Soo
came looking for a house

05:25.390 --> 05:27.900
Yesterday he saved his daughters

05:28.559 --> 05:29.830
In front of Wuzheng Inn

05:30.229 --> 05:31.229
Is it a hotel?

05:32.470 --> 05:34.330
I came because I was worried

05:35.039 --> 05:36.739
But then he got hurt

05:40.570 --> 05:43.239
Things worth loving

05:44.210 --> 05:46.248
What do you do together?

05:46.249 --> 05:47.280
Priest

05:48.280 --> 05:50.580
That 's definitely
the case

05:52.090 --> 05:54.859
Because he gets scared every time

05:55.660 --> 05:59.330
As for worrying about Sun-e, yes

06:00.689 --> 06:01.760
Excellent

06:02.460 --> 06:03.530
Go quickly

06:04.229 --> 06:05.470
If there is someone you want to meet

06:06.700 --> 06:07.729
No more, no more

06:08.270 --> 06:10.270
cat like girl

06:13.239 --> 06:14.270
hehe

06:18.910 --> 06:20.809
You must be kind to your sister

06:23.080 --> 06:25.719
look at that cute face

06:25.720 --> 06:27.989
Don't be aggressive, okay?

06:28.289 --> 06:29.289
Yes, I understand

06:29.859 --> 06:30.859
well done

06:33.429 --> 06:34.929
please continue

06:36.629 --> 06:38.470
- Come back early
- Yeah

06:39.270 --> 06:41.169
I will be scolded by my parents

06:42.400 --> 06:43.400
That's cool

06:44.369 --> 06:46.809
This sister will avoid it

06:47.910 --> 06:50.379
have a good time

06:50.910 --> 06:51.950
Disappeared

06:53.479 --> 06:56.150
- Come back early
- Yes, ma'am.

06:58.850 --> 07:00.390
Li Jing'e is real

07:02.260 --> 07:03.320
What's wrong

07:17.270 --> 07:19.409
- Affected area
- Yes

07:19.410 --> 07:20.510
How are you?

07:21.840 --> 07:22.939
very convenient

07:23.609 --> 07:26.510
I will apply soybeans later

07:29.049 --> 07:32.850
I've seen what works and
that's it

07:36.419 --> 07:39.660
We have a lot of soybeans on our roof

07:42.929 --> 07:45.200
roof?

07:45.900 --> 07:47.030
Is this the end of our roof?

07:48.869 --> 07:52.239
Two people together at night

07:57.840 --> 07:58.850
Miss

08:00.650 --> 08:01.780
When exactly?

08:03.020 --> 08:05.119
Do you remember how long we have been together?

08:06.890 --> 08:07.919
That's it

08:08.919 --> 08:12.030
I will stay with you and wait for my sister to come back

08:12.929 --> 08:14.429
until morning

08:15.530 --> 08:17.030
we were together the whole night

08:18.530 --> 08:20.798
That's why Hess
is totally to blame

08:20.799 --> 08:21.900
about that

08:23.070 --> 08:24.369
Anyone else know?

08:27.979 --> 08:29.010
hehe

08:30.280 --> 08:31.679
it will have no

08:35.220 --> 08:36.350
from now on

08:37.519 --> 08:38.550
Along the way

08:38.889 --> 08:41.659
So who is Jesus?

08:41.759 --> 08:43.290
With that hee hee hee hee

08:44.019 --> 08:45.290
How long have you known?

08:45.590 --> 08:47.960
Calling a boy's name so intimately
?

08:48.200 --> 08:51.430
Don't you know what people say about your sister?

08:51.970 --> 08:54.899
That night, heading to the house far away

08:55.100 --> 08:56.440
Why are you going?

08:56.769 --> 08:59.869
She said she drank to meet men

09:00.639 --> 09:03.609
Don't you know what you are saying?

09:05.180 --> 09:08.878
Why did the second daughter appear on the roof of their house with a man ?

09:08.879 --> 09:10.350
tell me you were there all night

09:10.950 --> 09:12.690
in such a small village

09:12.850 --> 09:14.618
Spreading rumors

09:14.619 --> 09:15.619
sooner or later

09:17.019 --> 09:18.029
you

09:18.960 --> 09:21.330
Why don't you ask your mother about this?

09:22.600 --> 09:24.560
- Father
- If there is no sin

09:25.269 --> 09:26.700
It will be convenient and free

09:29.540 --> 09:30.540
so

09:31.300 --> 09:32.369
nobody

09:33.040 --> 09:34.139
Absolutely

09:35.540 --> 09:37.340
Don't rave about it

09:45.389 --> 09:46.450
teacher

09:49.290 --> 09:50.460
Although my face is very hot

09:51.659 --> 09:52.759
continue

09:54.330 --> 09:55.529
I request

10:11.550 --> 10:14.149
(
Responsibly surrender illegal weapons)

10:17.649 --> 10:21.489
This guy is
a stubborn guy, keep your mouth shut

10:23.320 --> 10:25.789
Hey, this

10:25.790 --> 10:27.590
Was he innocent when he killed his victims ?

10:28.129 --> 10:29.600
last night

10:29.830 --> 10:32.800
When Lee Kyung-eul was beheaded in a house collapse

10:33.229 --> 10:34.840
Answer everyone

10:35.670 --> 10:36.769
I will ask

10:37.340 --> 10:40.810
How do I ask
my family?

10:41.609 --> 10:42.710
to make tears flow down

10:43.210 --> 10:44.979
illegal

10:46.080 --> 10:48.420
Hey, try to
gag this guy

10:49.080 --> 10:50.519
- Yes
Yes

10:52.619 --> 10:53.690
let's go

10:55.359 --> 10:56.359
come over

10:56.360 --> 10:57.618
(Crime-Free Village)

10:57.619 --> 10:58.690
far away

11:04.399 --> 11:07.700
Did you say
you were going to meet someone when we were talking?

11:08.540 --> 11:10.239
The night Hyun-ae left

11:11.369 --> 11:12.869
Yes

11:14.340 --> 11:17.810
But
he said he's a nice guy

11:18.710 --> 11:22.050
Thank you for saving my sister during the day

11:29.320 --> 11:31.159
Can you guess who it is?

11:31.659 --> 11:32.989
If confession is wrong

11:33.590 --> 11:35.028
Bahisu is a good reason to do so

11:35.029 --> 11:36.060
Because this is the only one

11:37.159 --> 11:40.629
I really want to protect my father,
not my mother

11:42.670 --> 11:43.739
Are you still affected?

11:43.970 --> 11:45.040
that night

11:45.269 --> 11:47.440
Li Jing'e was the last
person to meet

11:48.210 --> 11:49.879
The owner of the blue hat, Ba Yusup

11:51.040 --> 11:53.909
To
his brother, who I love deeply throughout my life

11:54.580 --> 11:56.149
My father did this to protect me

12:00.720 --> 12:02.960
Did he catch it this time?

12:03.320 --> 12:05.559
He once saved Yunwu once

12:05.560 --> 12:07.690
Thank you very much sir

12:08.330 --> 12:10.358
Really, why would you do this to our family?

12:10.359 --> 12:13.430
Don't you know there are some houses in this village that are in worse condition?

12:13.470 --> 12:16.570
It is the father's responsibility to solve the problem

12:18.440 --> 12:21.269
I have a personal question

12:21.409 --> 12:23.340
Anyway, I have to contact you

12:23.479 --> 12:25.079
If you want to know about Bakhisa

12:25.080 --> 12:26.249
in order to be able to communicate

12:27.680 --> 12:30.249
He hasn't returned to the dormitory for three days

12:35.159 --> 12:36.560
This is a frequently asked question

12:37.190 --> 12:39.359
While attending a good university in Seoul

12:39.960 --> 12:42.059
He will call his brother later

12:42.060 --> 12:44.560
Working in a factory when I was a child

12:45.200 --> 12:46.369
uncle?

12:46.899 --> 12:49.369
How tolerant is he of his brother?

12:49.670 --> 12:51.239
even though

12:52.210 --> 12:53.739
Come back every weekend

12:53.869 --> 12:56.009
He comes to see his brother

12:56.310 --> 12:59.879
Do you still have time to sleep in the dormitory?

13:01.950 --> 13:04.019
I have a headache

13:04.680 --> 13:07.090
Do you know the address of the dormitory?

13:08.519 --> 13:10.118
He said it was near the school

13:10.119 --> 13:12.560
Where is Shi Lindong?

13:13.489 --> 13:14.629
A shilling?

13:18.470 --> 13:21.070
I'm a student at Seoul National University, uncle

13:22.139 --> 13:24.039
University of Seoul

13:24.040 --> 13:25.539
Third-year student majoring in Korean literature

13:25.540 --> 13:27.939
I will keep helping you this month

13:27.940 --> 13:29.779
Ms. Li Zhuying

13:30.139 --> 13:32.449
Seoul National University, Korean Literature Major

13:32.450 --> 13:33.749
fourth grade students

13:35.279 --> 13:36.879
One school, one major

13:40.220 --> 13:43.060
If you knew the first victim, you would know

13:45.159 --> 13:47.028
Everything is covered like this

13:47.029 --> 13:48.560
How could they doubt it?

13:49.200 --> 13:52.399
My father was arrested protecting his brother

13:52.999 --> 13:55.600
Grandpa pretended not to know because he would spread the news throughout the village.

13:56.499 --> 13:59.070
Thanks to this, Ba Yusup
was able to hide

14:00.869 --> 14:02.210
But even so

14:04.180 --> 14:05.850
Why didn't you even say your name?

14:08.450 --> 14:09.619
I've already gone out

14:10.220 --> 14:11.350
for a while

14:12.249 --> 14:13.749
Passed by once

14:14.290 --> 14:15.889
Just try to be quiet, hey

14:18.119 --> 14:19.790
Hey guys, be careful

14:19.889 --> 14:22.460
Hey guys, give it a try

14:22.499 --> 14:24.960

14:28.739 --> 14:29.840

14:30.040 --> 14:31.569
Going crazy

14:31.570 --> 14:33.340
try to say it

14:34.940 --> 14:35.940
leader

14:36.239 --> 14:38.609
The policeman's son, Kim , picked this up from the ruins of the house.

14:39.249 --> 14:40.509
- Near a run-down house?
- Yes

14:40.909 --> 14:42.080
Should I post this as evidence?

14:42.350 --> 14:43.379
What's this?

14:45.090 --> 14:47.248
I think it's a chain

14:47.249 --> 14:48.319
try drawing

14:48.320 --> 14:49.889
This is on the neck.

14:53.659 --> 14:54.659

I just confessed

15:06.670 --> 15:08.580

Xixiu, are you okay?

15:18.180 --> 15:19.290
what is it?

15:19.489 --> 15:20.489
Hey guys, badum eight

15:21.519 --> 15:22.659
What's your job?

15:23.460 --> 15:25.460
please be careful

15:25.930 --> 15:27.729
This is this

15:28.460 --> 15:30.499
your brother

15:31.229 --> 15:32.600
What if?

15:33.430 --> 15:34.570
Gotta say it, man.

15:36.300 --> 15:37.540
this is mine

15:37.840 --> 15:40.109
He's like this crazy guy

15:40.409 --> 15:42.540
I just started gagging

15:43.210 --> 15:45.008
I rented him for a while

15:45.009 --> 15:46.350
It’s been a long time since I’ve returned anything.

15:47.379 --> 15:49.050
This was originally mine

15:49.580 --> 15:50.820
no my father

15:54.489 --> 15:55.489
I believe

15:56.259 --> 16:00.159
Growing up, his uncle
didn't even let him touch him with his fingers.

16:03.100 --> 16:05.060
Bashisu will say it's his

16:05.670 --> 16:07.070
they will really believe it

16:08.029 --> 16:09.170
As long as it's intact

16:09.470 --> 16:11.700
Although he will be released anyway

16:12.070 --> 16:13.569
This time because he admitted it

16:13.570 --> 16:14.570
I don't know what will happen

16:14.739 --> 16:17.279
We must
find a solution as soon as possible

16:17.580 --> 16:19.509
Are you really looking for it?

16:20.950 --> 16:22.249
Anyway, that chain

16:22.979 --> 16:25.249
He said it would be difficult to prove murder

16:26.019 --> 16:27.089
when it falls

16:27.090 --> 16:28.249
Because the location is unclear

16:31.190 --> 16:33.159
That's why
you'll find one ahead of time

16:34.759 --> 16:35.930
missing witness

16:41.070 --> 16:42.239
this is a shirt

16:42.940 --> 16:45.739
It may turn out to be a more important witness than you think

16:50.940 --> 16:52.879
-Police son Kim
-Miss Detective Lee

16:53.009 --> 16:54.050
Hey

16:55.550 --> 16:57.249
- Are you OK?
- certainly

16:57.550 --> 17:00.049
In an era that is still far away from scientific and technological testing,

17:00.050 --> 17:02.119
- a small mistake
- regards

17:17.040 --> 17:19.369
Even if it doesn't destroy everything instantly

17:20.340 --> 17:21.409
ha

17:23.510 --> 17:24.540
invalid evidence

17:25.379 --> 17:27.879
Not giving results
is not enough

17:30.219 --> 17:32.019
after investigation

17:32.020 --> 17:33.350
No more, no more

17:33.889 --> 17:35.560
the future is possible

17:35.719 --> 17:37.689
completely destroyed

17:44.800 --> 17:46.100
It will be different this time

17:46.600 --> 17:48.969
Only that witness can stay in good shape

17:49.340 --> 17:50.969
Ba Yusup now
has nowhere to hide

18:02.219 --> 18:03.280
Miss

18:03.619 --> 18:05.419
It's dangerous to bite and drive like this

18:05.750 --> 18:07.219
How is this going?

18:08.859 --> 18:09.889
That's it

18:10.590 --> 18:12.490
Detective Li said he forgot

18:13.090 --> 18:15.730
This is important so be sure to add it

18:17.000 --> 18:18.030
Yes

18:32.449 --> 18:33.709
Drive safely and carefully

18:34.980 --> 18:36.080
Yes

18:44.659 --> 18:47.060
I will keep looking for Bayusu until the results come out

18:47.929 --> 18:49.530
School factory dormitory

18:49.959 --> 18:52.070
I will
fight as much as possible

18:56.699 --> 18:57.899
Seoul Shilling-dong

19:00.040 --> 19:01.040
Father

19:01.980 --> 19:03.040
Father

19:03.909 --> 19:06.649
dad please open it

19:08.619 --> 19:10.419
Not yet

19:11.919 --> 19:14.990
How important are other people’s words?

19:17.159 --> 19:18.320
Jesus is...

19:19.760 --> 19:23.359
He won't talk about his daughter at all from his mouth

19:24.560 --> 19:26.000
Father

19:27.330 --> 19:30.040
My daughter hates herself so much

19:30.669 --> 19:33.439
I didn't know this could happen to my sister

19:35.209 --> 19:38.280
At that point, it would have been nice if my daughter had hung up the phone and said don't leave.

19:40.379 --> 19:42.719
Sister, that's not the case

19:44.879 --> 19:48.520
At that time, my daughter had no choice but to hang him.

19:55.189 --> 19:57.330
It's all my daughter's fault

19:58.730 --> 20:01.669
Really disgusting myself

20:03.000 --> 20:04.399
i hate it very much

20:07.740 --> 20:09.080
father, but of course

20:11.780 --> 20:13.010
daughter to sister

20:15.719 --> 20:17.580
i lost my sister

20:20.750 --> 20:22.688
No matter what kind of person the other person is

20:22.689 --> 20:24.189
Throw this away

20:26.330 --> 20:27.929
Not so yet

20:32.330 --> 20:34.669
This won't really happen

21:30.459 --> 21:32.490
Yin Yan help me

21:47.770 --> 21:49.179
Where are you going now?

21:49.439 --> 21:50.439
police station

21:50.810 --> 21:53.379
If you have been arrested so far,
you must recognize it

21:54.409 --> 21:56.280
Jesus is so scared now that he is alone

21:57.280 --> 21:58.280
you have to go quickly

22:00.990 --> 22:01.990
well done

22:03.659 --> 22:05.459
Now is not the time to enter

22:06.459 --> 22:07.530
What's the point?

22:09.959 --> 22:12.060
Adults will see it and fix it

22:13.070 --> 22:14.729
That's why I've been waiting

22:14.730 --> 22:15.899
What adults?

22:17.199 --> 22:18.540
without being sure of anything

22:18.909 --> 22:21.070
handcuffed and
arrested

22:21.939 --> 22:23.909
Such an old man actually spreads news in the village?

22:27.050 --> 22:29.550
You have Teacher Yin,
I have mom and dad

22:30.679 --> 22:31.980
no matter what

22:32.389 --> 22:34.820
I wouldn't do this if only adults were there to protect me

22:35.959 --> 22:38.020
But Jesus has no one

22:41.629 --> 22:42.730
I must go

22:45.199 --> 22:46.469
If you don't know, try to be quiet

22:47.129 --> 22:48.570
Because the police are crazy?

22:50.139 --> 22:51.699
This is what happened to Bays

22:52.469 --> 22:54.039
it's his fault

22:54.040 --> 22:55.580
what do you know?

22:57.010 --> 22:58.240
I must go

23:00.179 --> 23:01.209
release

23:03.850 --> 23:05.020
please release

23:09.159 --> 23:10.820
I must go

23:23.399 --> 23:25.070
I gotta go

23:30.280 --> 23:31.840
what he promised

23:36.280 --> 23:37.879
what he promised

24:09.719 --> 24:11.119
Is it really possible to apply soy sauce?

24:12.149 --> 24:13.419
he said he would apply it

24:14.619 --> 24:15.959
show me

24:16.290 --> 24:20.260
But I guess I must have laughed too much

24:20.590 --> 24:23.199
The smell comes out

24:23.230 --> 24:24.230
ha

24:25.199 --> 24:26.770
- Come on
- Oh

24:33.709 --> 24:34.810
I can't open my eyes

24:35.570 --> 24:37.040
Yes

25:08.040 --> 25:09.340
(Huhu ointment)

25:12.850 --> 25:15.250
Who is crazy about using soybean oil in this era
?

25:16.320 --> 25:17.520
Hey

25:23.590 --> 25:24.619
if

25:25.889 --> 25:26.929
Just talk like your peers

25:29.159 --> 25:30.199
Do you not like it?

25:32.830 --> 25:33.899
love it

25:43.010 --> 25:45.850
I'm afraid because I like

25:51.050 --> 25:53.949
No matter what, you are mine

25:57.320 --> 25:58.790
I think it will be very valuable

26:00.359 --> 26:01.490
why is that?

26:04.730 --> 26:06.169
Because I lose people easily

26:08.969 --> 26:10.939
my mom and dad

26:11.869 --> 26:13.010
Big brother

26:15.469 --> 26:18.409
if i love and appreciate

26:21.909 --> 26:23.050
they all left

26:38.399 --> 26:39.600
Excellent

26:42.899 --> 26:44.340
i swear sometimes

26:45.439 --> 26:47.669
if you feel alone and scared

26:49.740 --> 26:51.209
I imagined a small door

26:54.709 --> 26:56.419
small door?

27:00.090 --> 27:01.090
Excellent

27:03.359 --> 27:06.389
There is a door in my heart

27:08.590 --> 27:09.959
behind that door

27:10.929 --> 27:13.030
There's always someone waiting for me

27:19.000 --> 27:21.409
when you feel scared and alone

27:22.510 --> 27:24.379
Close your eyes and imagine
that little door

27:27.480 --> 27:30.949
So I will always
wait behind that door

27:34.149 --> 27:35.619
you just open the door

27:39.189 --> 27:40.260
you do not say

27:41.929 --> 27:42.929
Excellent

28:21.600 --> 28:23.139
Lee Seung-il, be careful

28:27.469 --> 28:28.969
How much do you think about him

28:29.879 --> 28:32.040
If you think he has your best interests at heart,
you are wrong

28:32.679 --> 28:34.250
what do you know?

28:40.689 --> 28:41.719
sunshine air

28:44.490 --> 28:45.888
I am disappointed

28:45.889 --> 28:47.129
Disappointing as much as I liked

28:49.429 --> 28:52.330
It 's going to be so much better for you now that it's all over

29:10.820 --> 29:13.449
I really
saw it with my own eyes

29:13.949 --> 29:15.689
My mother and father also met

29:16.159 --> 29:17.888
During our study tour

29:17.889 --> 29:20.560
- A cute guy playing guitar
- Yeah

29:21.290 --> 29:23.260
He was handcuffed like this

29:23.629 --> 29:26.898
If you can't lean and are shaking

29:26.899 --> 29:28.199
Someone who "needs to be told"?

29:28.699 --> 29:30.300
he he he

29:32.270 --> 29:34.469
How did it happen?

29:34.609 --> 29:36.279
Isn't that true?

29:36.280 --> 29:37.679
- Well
- that's what I said.

29:38.879 --> 29:40.349
- That's terrible.
- Yeah.

29:40.350 --> 29:42.550
- Yeah, I'd be scared
- Stupid

29:44.580 --> 29:46.250
This just complicates things

30:02.230 --> 30:05.270
Your class teacher
due to personal reasons

30:05.669 --> 30:07.209
I can't come these days

30:07.869 --> 30:09.709
In the meantime, there’s no need to ask for trouble

30:10.109 --> 30:11.409
All focus on learning

30:12.609 --> 30:14.080
Who is that and
why hasn’t it come yet?

30:15.280 --> 30:16.750
The murderer's residence

30:22.790 --> 30:24.020
immature guy

30:24.189 --> 30:26.629
So far nothing is certain,
only one roommate

30:26.830 --> 30:28.628
What did you say?

30:28.629 --> 30:30.060
my father said

30:30.859 --> 30:33.330
No one in our village
would do such a thing

30:33.469 --> 30:35.300
But Bashisu has already
transferred to another school

30:35.600 --> 30:36.898
Moved from far away

30:36.899 --> 30:38.939
his uncle is a policeman

30:39.169 --> 30:41.770
Arrested
Isn't it obvious?

30:42.070 --> 30:44.179
- Inlay arrested
- Yes

30:44.580 --> 30:46.080
- That's right
- I got caught anyway.

30:47.480 --> 30:48.810
- what have you done?
- Um

31:05.199 --> 31:06.330
Mother

31:06.530 --> 31:09.030
- mother
- mother

31:09.070 --> 31:11.569
- Mom
- Okay

31:11.570 --> 31:12.739
- Mom
- Are you okay?

31:12.740 --> 31:13.809
Mother

31:13.810 --> 31:14.868
(Urgent Care Center)

31:14.869 --> 31:16.339
Mother

31:16.340 --> 31:17.340
patient

31:18.510 --> 31:20.280
No adults?

31:22.409 --> 31:23.449
a while

31:26.149 --> 31:27.419
(Father)

32:08.889 --> 32:10.699
Where are you at the end of today?

32:12.230 --> 32:15.330
There's something wrong with your uncle

32:18.669 --> 32:19.740
Why?

32:27.709 --> 32:28.780
Father

32:30.050 --> 32:32.149
This time he chose his younger brother

32:33.320 --> 32:35.290
No matter how small my mother is

32:35.820 --> 32:37.789
How complicated is his life?

32:37.790 --> 32:39.260
again and again

32:40.260 --> 32:41.889
Bigger than us

32:43.129 --> 32:45.129
selected

32:47.369 --> 32:48.969
It seems like I will be like this for the rest of my life

32:56.179 --> 32:58.939
(live)

33:29.810 --> 33:34.178
(Wusong Transportation)

33:34.179 --> 33:37.020
(City bus terminal, ticket office)

33:39.550 --> 33:42.250
Seoul is quite big

33:47.760 --> 33:49.929
He was even arrested on behalf of his brother

33:50.560 --> 33:52.699
A person pretends not to know and hides

33:54.429 --> 33:55.899
Even if it's easy to find, it's still weirder

33:59.439 --> 34:01.740
we were wrong

34:04.010 --> 34:05.439
This is done to cover baghisu

34:07.179 --> 34:08.409
this is not murder

34:10.679 --> 34:11.679
Very strange

34:12.219 --> 34:15.520
No confessions until we arrive

34:17.060 --> 34:19.388
Bayes
has always been under suspicion

34:19.389 --> 34:21.029
the shirt and keys

34:21.860 --> 34:24.500
He said it's all his, but
he's not the murderer

34:26.529 --> 34:29.130
Those who are willing to repent
can avoid committing sins

34:30.900 --> 34:31.940
That is

34:32.600 --> 34:34.068
Because the evidence is uncertain

34:34.069 --> 34:35.170
Want to go out

34:36.069 --> 34:37.080
It is not

34:38.210 --> 34:39.779
really not

34:41.250 --> 34:43.119
everyone i met there

34:43.380 --> 34:44.850
He only asked one question

34:46.179 --> 34:48.389
" When was the last time you saw Bayous ?"

35:02.630 --> 35:03.868
(Ba Yusu, 23 years old)

35:03.869 --> 35:05.339
(Working in a leather factory)

35:17.049 --> 35:18.219
I have no idea

35:22.250 --> 35:24.790
How can we know everything when we live in the same dormitory
?

35:25.360 --> 35:26.460
we don't know anything

35:26.989 --> 35:27.989
Do not ask

35:32.529 --> 35:33.600
that night

35:34.929 --> 35:36.739
Being dragged from the front row

35:37.000 --> 35:38.900
I can see it with my own eyes

35:40.210 --> 35:41.639
i can't do anything

35:43.480 --> 35:45.139
I can't even go

35:50.719 --> 35:52.549
I've lost a lot of blood

35:54.020 --> 35:56.860
Are you sure you can still run with such an injury
?

35:58.759 --> 36:01.330
After that day,
there was no contact

36:02.690 --> 36:04.159
I am very worried

36:05.400 --> 36:07.069
Half pretending not to want to know

36:07.730 --> 36:09.400
About half of the story

36:10.469 --> 36:11.969
Night of the 16th

36:12.500 --> 36:14.469
They all saw Bayusu

36:15.310 --> 36:17.008
