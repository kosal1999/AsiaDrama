"The Stranger I Met"
Episode 3

00:16.511 --> 00:19.121
(Wu Gang Dumu)

00:28.891 --> 00:31.560
(Kyung Gi Joo)

00:40.801 --> 00:44.011
"A Stranger I Met"

00:46.441 --> 00:49.510
So this is not an ordinary car but
a time travel machine.

00:49.511 --> 00:50.919
Time travel is over there

00:50.920 --> 00:52.580
I was hit by this car

00:52.581 --> 00:55.591
This goes back to 1987
?

00:55.691 --> 00:57.590
- Cool
- Cool, right?

00:57.591 --> 01:00.220
Seeing such a situation,
can you still say such a thing?

01:00.221 --> 01:01.929
The car will be repaired anyway

01:01.930 --> 01:03.260
Until then, stay here

01:03.261 --> 01:05.100
My name is Li Shengyi

01:05.301 --> 01:07.100
don't call me mom

01:07.261 --> 01:08.430
really scared

01:08.501 --> 01:10.000
What's your real name?

01:10.001 --> 01:11.641
My name is Baisu

01:13.040 --> 01:14.839
Are they all girls from your school?

01:14.840 --> 01:16.209
He fell into the water without saving him

01:16.210 --> 01:17.709
Which friends are watching?

01:17.710 --> 01:19.281
Pretend you don't want to see it, sister

01:19.881 --> 01:21.250
one year later

01:21.251 --> 01:23.450
I will die at the age of 35

01:23.781 --> 01:26.179
The defendant who killed me was in 1987

01:26.180 --> 01:28.849
Because Wu Zongri is the culprit of the serial murders

01:28.850 --> 01:31.020
This also appeared at the scene of my death

01:31.021 --> 01:33.190
This is the defendant's trademark from 1987

01:33.191 --> 01:36.061
In any case, it must be sent back before

01:37.930 --> 01:38.959
(Bom Bom Theater)

01:38.960 --> 01:40.061
that's why

01:49.070 --> 01:52.781
(Part 3 - The Secret You Have)

02:06.090 --> 02:07.161
I know

02:08.460 --> 02:11.531
The era suddenly comes and
there is something to do

02:11.700 --> 02:14.001
How illogical and
strange

02:16.471 --> 02:17.501
but

02:24.681 --> 02:25.711
go out

02:37.691 --> 02:39.760
Because it's colder here than outside

02:45.360 --> 02:46.661
First let's go outside

02:53.600 --> 02:55.211
Part (3)

03:06.320 --> 03:09.251
Anyway, I think it will be difficult to go back tonight.

03:21.770 --> 03:22.901
Get dressed and come out

03:42.890 --> 03:46.091
Are Kimizu and our mother friends?

03:48.360 --> 03:49.631
same class

03:53.830 --> 03:56.100
Novel
How did it actually happen?

03:57.001 --> 04:00.001
Because no one likes me very much

04:01.570 --> 04:02.741
that's why

04:05.181 --> 04:06.640
That's why I want to say...

04:09.811 --> 04:11.281
I want to die

04:13.221 --> 04:15.591
Mom will have times like this too

04:15.691 --> 04:17.491
never imagined

04:18.661 --> 04:20.061
Is that all?

04:21.191 --> 04:23.491
The mother time I didn’t know

04:24.131 --> 04:27.931
I once
wanted to be a novelist

04:28.200 --> 04:29.530
What kind of content?

04:30.231 --> 04:32.671
Can you give my mother a signed book?

04:33.840 --> 04:35.070
Do not you understand?

04:35.171 --> 04:36.640
What books will I read?

04:37.311 --> 04:41.181
At the same time, how much do I miss my mom?

04:56.030 --> 04:57.090
No

04:58.231 --> 04:59.830
Everything can change here

05:09.611 --> 05:13.111
(Bom Bom Theater)

05:22.720 --> 05:24.520
How did you know?

05:27.621 --> 05:29.861
I think I can't go back now

05:30.861 --> 05:32.631
There's work to be done here

05:38.441 --> 05:40.540
What to do there?

05:40.541 --> 05:41.541
(Bom Bom Theater)

05:45.510 --> 05:47.041
Do you remember them?

05:48.681 --> 05:52.181
5 months and 14 days, 5 months and 16 days, 1987

05:52.621 --> 05:55.090
Two women take turns to die

05:56.551 --> 05:59.291
Then No. 20 disappeared and
has not been found yet.

05:59.520 --> 06:00.660
a woman

06:01.590 --> 06:04.030
Yes, I've seen them all around

06:04.361 --> 06:05.631
Knowledge

06:06.660 --> 06:08.801
Those who were not killed by you

06:09.200 --> 06:10.501
not really

06:11.101 --> 06:13.871
If those detectives
hadn't blamed me then...

06:16.441 --> 06:17.671
I am strong

06:18.381 --> 06:19.640
Please trust me

06:22.650 --> 06:25.121
Then this

06:26.121 --> 06:28.121
List of main suspects at the time

06:29.551 --> 06:31.220
There are three people including you

06:32.291 --> 06:34.791
Do you remember the other two?

06:36.691 --> 06:39.601
Yes, because the community is small

06:41.570 --> 06:42.770
from now on

06:43.501 --> 06:45.501
Regarding these six people, including the parties concerned

06:46.070 --> 06:47.970
tell me everything you remember

06:48.570 --> 06:50.410
Just small is fine

06:53.111 --> 06:55.811
I don't know if it's accurate because it has a long memory

06:57.051 --> 06:58.681
Just for reference, don’t worry

06:59.520 --> 07:01.520
I will introduce it in detail myself

07:03.791 --> 07:06.861
Because this is a case that doesn't leave much evidence

07:08.390 --> 07:09.931
That's why it's as close as possible

07:10.390 --> 07:12.330
I will join them and watch

07:12.830 --> 07:14.871
Every action is monitored

07:17.301 --> 07:18.871
you have to wait

07:21.570 --> 07:23.311
Until shortly before the incident

07:30.751 --> 07:34.251
At that time, at least half of these six people
were of mixed race.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.191
Where do you think it is?

07:37.991 --> 07:40.561
I'm mixed raceI'm mixed race

07:43.530 --> 07:44.590
School?

07:46.830 --> 07:47.830
School

07:49.830 --> 07:51.301
start from there

07:52.270 --> 07:54.241
I think I have to go to school

07:56.941 --> 07:59.881
I have to go to school

08:01.481 --> 08:02.681
hot pot

08:03.780 --> 08:05.450
- Hot hot hot
- Are you crazy?

08:05.881 --> 08:06.921
It's hot

08:07.181 --> 08:10.320
(Contact to inquire about spies and communist criminals)

08:13.991 --> 08:16.830
Do I really have to pay if I get caught?

08:17.090 --> 08:19.160
Is it because of meeting a stranger that this happened?

08:20.801 --> 08:22.801
Everyone I see is weird

08:23.270 --> 08:24.470
look at him

08:26.900 --> 08:30.269
- Let's go
- Next round

08:30.270 --> 08:31.941
- Kyung Hee
- Miss

08:32.041 --> 08:34.111
I even know how many hammers and spoons he has in his house

08:34.280 --> 08:35.611
he is hopeless

08:36.180 --> 08:39.981
Do you recognize an unfamiliar face or
unfamiliar words?

08:40.081 --> 08:41.990
Like coming from a strange other world

08:41.991 --> 08:44.251
Strange faces, another world

08:44.420 --> 08:46.659
Yes, and where is this place?

08:46.660 --> 08:48.861
People who don’t know what day of the week it is

08:50.731 --> 08:52.429
- Yeah, I don't know
- Well

08:52.430 --> 08:53.430
and then

08:53.431 --> 08:56.101
Holding a strange machine and
saying strange things

08:57.701 --> 08:58.701
Weird machine...

08:59.601 --> 09:02.010
Yesterday I met such a person

09:02.341 --> 09:05.340
Oh, great, I
get to see you every day

09:05.341 --> 09:07.080
I can see clearly
because I have good eyes

09:07.081 --> 09:08.111
No

09:08.481 --> 09:09.510
Who is that?

09:11.451 --> 09:13.020
Who are you asking?

09:14.081 --> 09:17.351
School, do you think this makes sense now?

09:18.621 --> 09:20.461
as
a student, not a teacher

09:22.030 --> 09:23.790
Is there such a terrible thing?

09:24.190 --> 09:25.660
I don't even know how hot it is

09:33.371 --> 09:35.871
Well, you'll know when you look at it

09:36.270 --> 09:38.740
if you remove makeup

09:38.741 --> 09:40.940
Because the face of the modern era is difficult to predict

09:41.951 --> 09:43.779
If you say you have been out of school for three years

09:43.780 --> 09:44.920
completely..

09:47.981 --> 09:50.091
You don't have to worry about this

09:50.550 --> 09:51.991
Have you forgotten where this place is?

09:52.821 --> 09:54.491
Drink slowly while it's hot

10:05.640 --> 10:07.741
I will never forget 1987

10:09.741 --> 10:11.711
Anyway, I
can't go back now

10:13.481 --> 10:16.150
It is safe to take a form

10:17.981 --> 10:20.020
I did it over there, so
I can do it too, right?

10:24.020 --> 10:25.060
on the other hand

10:25.361 --> 10:27.420
Don't you think this plan is wrong?

10:28.591 --> 10:30.861
What procedures are required?
After both parties apply

10:38.270 --> 10:39.440
Not that one

10:40.571 --> 10:43.241
Is that why we have to do it here
?

10:45.940 --> 10:48.981
So
I think it's only right to first explain what it's all about

11:04.091 --> 11:05.930
Is anyone coming this time?

11:11.030 --> 11:12.241
Is it possible to do this?

11:12.841 --> 11:14.269
After all, he is a teacher from Wuzheng Middle School

11:14.270 --> 11:15.371
If the chairman knew

11:17.341 --> 11:19.711
We
are also familiar with the battalion commander

11:34.721 --> 11:37.030
What are Badang Badan doing here?

11:42.201 --> 11:44.001
I'll be back soon

11:59.121 --> 12:00.381
What happened this time

12:00.550 --> 12:01.990
Wujiang Municipal Public Security Bureau Serious Case Brigade

12:01.991 --> 12:03.020
Badong Detective No. 8

12:03.150 --> 12:05.091
I'm here to confirm.
please wait for a moment

12:05.461 --> 12:06.461
stay

12:07.621 --> 12:10.131
I think it needs to be explained what the problem is

12:11.900 --> 12:14.030
Do you think it is necessary now?

12:14.461 --> 12:15.501
here

12:16.501 --> 12:17.731
teacher

12:17.800 --> 12:19.540
Will you call the chairman?

12:19.770 --> 12:22.241
That guy is always
talking nonsense on a moonlit night

12:22.741 --> 12:24.611
Mazuto

12:41.991 --> 12:43.231
Let's register

12:43.631 --> 12:44.690
Carefully this time

12:46.160 --> 12:47.601
- Shin
- Didn't you hear?

12:48.331 --> 12:50.601
I'm here because I got a complaint about a stranger

12:50.900 --> 12:52.601
Register

12:55.871 --> 12:57.170
Disappeared once before

13:09.790 --> 13:12.361
If you don't even make that much effort

13:13.020 --> 13:15.991
I don't think there's any other way to prove who you are

13:18.361 --> 13:19.400
I know

13:20.430 --> 13:21.501
let's go

13:22.270 --> 13:23.501
Wait, police station?

13:23.800 --> 13:25.540
- Come on
- Police station?

13:27.270 --> 13:28.341
-Wait
a moment

13:41.451 --> 13:42.451
Are you crazy?

13:43.491 --> 13:44.951
Are you doing this because you trust the chairman?

13:45.190 --> 13:46.519
to show action

13:46.520 --> 13:48.260
I know you are so passionate

13:48.491 --> 13:50.461
I helped because I was worried that I would suffer in vain.

13:50.861 --> 13:52.160
this is a waste of time

13:53.101 --> 13:56.101
Have accurate information and
a way to prove it

13:56.800 --> 13:59.571
You can verify it yourself if you wish

14:05.841 --> 14:07.910
Have specific information

14:09.081 --> 14:10.111
Yes

14:11.310 --> 14:12.420
This kid...

14:17.951 --> 14:19.060
This kid...

14:22.961 --> 14:26.101
Wuzheng Middle School
senior students

14:31.030 --> 14:32.201
Ross

14:47.050 --> 14:48.821
-Is it really big?
-certainly

14:49.420 --> 14:50.690
OK

14:54.390 --> 14:55.759
-Hi
-Hi

14:55.760 --> 14:57.060
oh

15:28.091 --> 15:30.260
What year were you born? Aw 1965

15:30.361 --> 15:31.659
May 15, 1965

15:31.660 --> 15:33.299
Good morning sir

15:33.300 --> 15:34.429
Well, hello, Miss Sun

15:34.430 --> 15:35.570
- Hello
- Mitsu?

15:35.571 --> 15:37.300
- I'm a lady
- Cool, yes.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.241
I'm really grateful for this

15:42.770 --> 15:45.510
What should I do after my registration number is 63?

15:49.280 --> 15:50.581
I will take a short break

15:50.780 --> 15:51.821
come over

15:52.180 --> 15:54.419
Why
?

15:54.420 --> 15:56.520
- Come here, wait a minute.
- What is this place?

16:03.231 --> 16:04.430
Why is this a toy store?

16:04.731 --> 16:08.400
Now I know how dangerous it is

16:08.871 --> 16:10.600
If something goes wrong, you and me

16:10.601 --> 16:12.799
It ends awkwardly here

16:12.800 --> 16:13.871
I know

16:14.270 --> 16:15.670
I saw and felt it yesterday

16:16.170 --> 16:18.009
I will go to school to avoid making mistakes

16:18.010 --> 16:19.341
Be sure to say the word

16:19.711 --> 16:21.581
I went because I had something to do

16:22.351 --> 16:24.610
Because this is a dangerous situation

16:24.611 --> 16:25.821
The lake has been prepared for a long time

16:26.081 --> 16:27.850
Get ready for the pool..Use words like this

16:27.851 --> 16:29.491
Be careful

16:32.690 --> 16:34.560
I know, I'm sorry,
I'll be careful

16:35.930 --> 16:37.631
Because this is the first trip

16:38.231 --> 16:39.231
that's why

16:39.831 --> 16:42.201
The first person to travel through time.
What were you doing in school?

16:48.241 --> 16:50.310
There must be a reason

16:53.081 --> 16:54.341
Do you think you don’t know enough?

16:55.410 --> 16:57.810
A person who can travel freely through time and space

16:58.310 --> 17:00.750
Another time, I bought a house

17:00.751 --> 17:02.019
Pretend to be an ordinary teacher

17:02.020 --> 17:03.650
Travel to and from the office as usual

17:04.690 --> 17:05.790
To and from the office

17:09.331 --> 17:11.390
worst thing in life

17:14.831 --> 17:17.929
Such
a dangerous and dangerous lie

17:17.930 --> 17:19.199
enough to think

17:19.200 --> 17:21.541
It must be for important personal reasons

17:23.470 --> 17:25.980
But I don't ask
why

17:27.581 --> 17:30.081
If you don’t have the confidence to speak up,
don’t ask.

17:32.121 --> 17:33.121
correct answer

17:35.250 --> 17:36.621
let's do what we have to do first

17:37.091 --> 17:39.590
Instead,
let’s not encounter difficult situations like yesterday

17:39.591 --> 17:40.960
I will try

17:43.031 --> 17:44.531
until we come back

17:44.730 --> 17:45.900
Because they are in the same boat

17:46.930 --> 17:48.670
I have to go to school

17:48.831 --> 17:50.430
Return to China after graduation

17:51.101 --> 17:53.170
Be as inconspicuous as possible

17:53.670 --> 17:55.771
if it interferes with my case

17:55.871 --> 17:57.410
At that time, school was over

17:57.740 --> 17:58.940
This is true no matter what time

18:00.611 --> 18:01.680
I agree

18:03.910 --> 18:06.351
But I don’t know if the detective yesterday
will come again.

18:08.150 --> 18:09.150
i don't know how to speak

18:10.950 --> 18:12.021
Let's go first

18:13.291 --> 18:14.291
let's go

18:30.940 --> 18:32.440
Yes Yes

18:32.680 --> 18:35.350
What are you afraid of?

18:35.351 --> 18:36.650
Don't worry

18:37.111 --> 18:39.881
It is also possible for young people to work part-time

18:41.121 --> 18:44.220
Come back quickly and buy a bottle of rice wine

18:45.321 --> 18:46.760
The only son was sent to a distant place

18:46.761 --> 18:48.890
Think of your lonely friend

18:49.190 --> 18:52.060
Cool, I know, hang up,
Commander Gin.

18:52.061 --> 18:53.560
(Principal Yoon Bong-koo)

18:53.561 --> 18:55.271
sorry

18:55.631 --> 18:57.801
My call is a bit long

18:58.841 --> 18:59.970
Now

19:01.940 --> 19:03.940
I am really happy today

19:04.410 --> 19:06.341
This is my
first time moving to a new school since school started

19:07.111 --> 19:08.410
even two

19:08.781 --> 19:10.011
This is also within one day

19:11.910 --> 19:13.649
There is another picture

19:13.650 --> 19:15.121
- I don't wear it
- I don't wear it

19:22.390 --> 19:25.600
Although
I briefly met him in a club not too long ago

19:25.601 --> 19:26.700
say goodbye officially

19:26.900 --> 19:28.531
I am Mr. Yoon Hye-jun

19:30.200 --> 19:32.101
if you look carefully

19:32.271 --> 19:33.670
- Picture..
- I don't wear it

19:33.900 --> 19:34.900
Yes

19:39.311 --> 19:40.381
Anyway

19:41.341 --> 19:44.081
From today on, this
is your nephew's class teacher.

19:46.420 --> 19:47.950
Is the father the same person?

19:50.490 --> 19:51.551
so me too

19:51.890 --> 19:52.960
I need it

19:53.861 --> 19:57.090
Detective Badong
is a very good detective

19:57.091 --> 19:59.630
Thanks to these children, our village

19:59.631 --> 20:01.100
very safe

20:01.101 --> 20:02.970
I have to think of it as gratitude

20:04.400 --> 20:06.400
i absolutely need it

20:10.511 --> 20:13.511
How could I meet such a nice person last night?

20:15.081 --> 20:17.581
Oh, sorry, Chairman

20:18.480 --> 20:21.220
No,
I didn't know it was a member of our family

20:21.581 --> 20:23.890
Because the head teacher and parents of students

20:24.220 --> 20:26.321
We are all part of the Wuzheng Middle School family

20:26.920 --> 20:29.429
Let's get comfortable,
okay?

20:29.430 --> 20:30.631
second head

20:35.261 --> 20:37.230
The first head is here too

20:38.500 --> 20:40.499
What a mystery

20:40.500 --> 20:43.571
Uncle Yang, I see these two heads here

20:51.450 --> 20:52.750
as far as I know

20:53.150 --> 20:54.851
It seems you don't have a father either

21:01.091 --> 21:02.730
not talking

21:05.460 --> 21:06.660
What happened again?

21:07.031 --> 21:08.330
Even though he moved to a new school

21:08.331 --> 21:10.571
If you come with distant relatives

21:11.301 --> 21:12.601
The answer is obvious

21:19.041 --> 21:20.910
Even if there are still people who won’t come

21:22.650 --> 21:25.281
elementary, middle, and
high school

21:25.621 --> 21:27.350
Welcome ceremony graduation sports meeting

21:27.351 --> 21:29.150
Such a person has never been here for a day

21:30.291 --> 21:32.419
After drinking,
he started fighting with someone by the collar.

21:32.420 --> 21:35.730
Such a person has gone through all the important moments in my life

21:37.460 --> 21:39.061
My father is such a person

21:39.631 --> 21:41.301
Is there such a father?

21:42.230 --> 21:43.301
bamboo

21:44.601 --> 21:47.271
It feels strange to hear these words from your mouth

21:51.871 --> 21:54.611
So what's the main thing?

21:54.841 --> 21:55.881
preschool

21:57.511 --> 22:00.450
School name must be

22:03.321 --> 22:06.660

22:07.460 --> 22:08.861
Ekantasun E also...

22:10.861 --> 22:11.890
hehe

22:13.101 --> 22:14.101
Did I tell you yesterday?

22:14.102 --> 22:15.601
- Not interested
- Wait a minute

22:16.771 --> 22:18.370
hehe

22:18.371 --> 22:19.770
I also said it yesterday

22:19.771 --> 22:21.301
Don't meddle in my business

22:23.511 --> 22:25.111
open my ears

22:26.811 --> 22:29.311
(teacher's office)

22:31.950 --> 22:34.180
Not like distant relatives

22:34.680 --> 22:36.190
Didn't I say it's cool?

22:39.460 --> 22:41.890
Yes, although I promise to keep it that way

22:44.730 --> 22:46.600
- So cute
- No, he's the coolest

22:46.601 --> 22:48.560
- Haha-
He bought it

22:48.561 --> 22:51.830
- Hey, I don't have any pocket money.
- Let me do it.

22:51.831 --> 22:54.140
- That's right
- not these girls.

22:54.271 --> 22:57.011
- Hey, do you have any left?
- No, give me one.

This is the same lesson we started teaching today

23:46.861 --> 23:47.990
Pei Yunying

23:48.420 --> 23:50.561
I missed a little school because of housework

23:50.861 --> 23:52.189
a little older than you

23:52.190 --> 23:53.730
What does it have to do with old age?

23:54.700 --> 23:57.000
If you are in the same class,
you are all friends

23:57.200 --> 23:59.499
- That's right
- Yes

23:59.500 --> 24:01.541
Cool, check it out yourself

24:07.111 --> 24:09.881
You three, Ginglieburt,
are barely moving.

24:10.210 --> 24:13.281
If you bully a new classmate,
you will be punished

24:13.950 --> 24:15.020
Yes

24:15.021 --> 24:17.591
The same goes for upper-class seniors

24:18.190 --> 24:21.291
There is indeed no hope

Except our Mitsu

24:28.831 --> 24:30.400
There's an empty seat there.
Go sit down.

24:32.101 --> 24:33.101
Yes

24:34.670 --> 24:35.740
That's it

24:36.111 --> 24:38.011
- thanks,
thanks

24:50.150 --> 24:51.790
come over

24:51.791 --> 24:53.820
- Ha
- Hey

24:53.821 --> 24:56.660
- Don't do this.
- Really?

24:56.890 --> 24:59.699
- Are you kidding me?
- Very good.

24:59.700 --> 25:02.030
- That's what I can do
- Hey, the teacher is here

25:02.031 --> 25:04.200
- You
- bring it back.

25:04.601 --> 25:05.841

What have you done?

25:35.200 --> 25:36.230
Yes

25:37.430 --> 25:39.041
Said a lot

25:40.640 --> 25:43.940
Because it goes against the spirit of rock and roll

25:51.011 --> 25:52.821
- Okay
- See?

25:54.781 --> 25:55.791
Excellent

25:57.051 --> 25:59.189
Yes, that's how the pattern is set up

25:59.190 --> 26:00.361
What will happen if we go against the spirit?

26:01.021 --> 26:02.590
sit where you like

26:02.591 --> 26:03.761
That's it

26:04.631 --> 26:05.660
smoothly

26:07.301 --> 26:08.831
- smoothly
- smoothly

26:15.771 --> 26:16.940
How did it happen?

26:20.111 --> 26:22.480
I think I should stay here a little longer

26:23.351 --> 26:24.351
are you happy?

26:29.690 --> 26:32.091
Do you like Virginia Wolfe?

26:40.900 --> 26:42.000
Do you know this book?

26:47.440 --> 26:50.170
"If you give her a hundred years."

26:51.341 --> 26:53.240
"Give her her own room."

26:53.640 --> 26:55.381
"If you give me 500 days a year"

26:56.650 --> 26:59.220

she will."

Slater ranked fourth

28:06.051 --> 28:07.781
Are you playing with electronic codes?

28:08.881 --> 28:11.621
Bamboo fingers are also very fast and
have a good sense of rhythm

28:12.960 --> 28:14.690
I finally found my partner

28:16.930 --> 28:17.990
I am very happy

28:18.761 --> 28:20.700
My name is Yu Bum

28:23.031 --> 28:24.430
Aren't you crazy?

28:28.170 --> 28:29.311
I am very happy

28:29.440 --> 28:32.881
Said he was very happy

28:33.381 --> 28:34.841
I have to say something, don't I?

28:37.111 --> 28:39.220
but in a decidedly childish way

28:42.821 --> 28:44.420
Because they are all childish jokes

28:56.430 --> 28:57.670
What will it be?

29:09.680 --> 29:11.210
I don’t know if it’s a good use or not.

29:12.480 --> 29:14.250
- Already following
- Yes

Where are you pretending to be kissing?
Do you want to die?

29:52.720 --> 29:54.861
Because I don’t have time, I listen carefully

29:55.321 --> 29:58.031
Now the other person’s eyes

29:59.930 --> 30:01.031
look at this

30:05.331 --> 30:06.601
almost

30:07.170 --> 30:10.011
And then all of a sudden,
what was that?

30:12.640 --> 30:15.381
Well, that's a nod.

30:16.281 --> 30:18.950
Just then he sat down to pack his things

30:19.581 --> 30:21.420
raise your head like this

30:21.821 --> 30:24.021
I had a nosebleed once...

30:31.990 --> 30:33.061
Hey you won't do this again

30:33.261 --> 30:35.801
Now that I think about it I'm doing this

30:36.170 --> 30:37.670
I'll bow like this

30:40.371 --> 30:43.440
Is the head made of stone?

30:48.311 --> 30:51.081
That's
why you teach

30:54.720 --> 30:55.720
ha

30:59.190 --> 31:02.220
Our father taught us this

31:04.890 --> 31:06.561
when i started preschool

31:06.960 --> 31:08.761
If the first child you meet is aggressive

31:08.900 --> 31:10.230
I told him he did it to scare me

31:11.871 --> 31:14.540
Although my parents
passed away when I graduated, I am no longer with them

31:14.541 --> 31:16.341
Although I have never learned anything other than this

31:17.640 --> 31:19.980
but because it's still useful

31:23.450 --> 31:26.621
Dads want to teach techniques like this

31:28.250 --> 31:29.281
that's why

31:30.351 --> 31:32.091
Does your father want to run away?

31:33.321 --> 31:34.660
There must be a reason

31:41.960 --> 31:43.831
- You know what
- Yeah

31:45.730 --> 31:48.200
A 19-year-old boy is teaching children

31:49.071 --> 31:50.511
There's no need for that

31:59.281 --> 32:00.351
ha

32:02.180 --> 32:03.190
How are you?

32:04.091 --> 32:06.660
- My nose is bleeding.
- Ha.

32:12.531 --> 32:13.531
Are you crazy?

32:13.532 --> 32:14.801
Please be quiet

32:18.601 --> 32:20.440
I can't concentrate anymore

32:27.210 --> 32:29.011

What were you told to do after graduation?

33:35.881 --> 33:37.611
- I have to go home
- I have to go home

33:40.051 --> 33:41.950
Yes, I have to go back and do my homework.

33:42.650 --> 33:45.390
Don't go out after ten o'clock in the evening

33:45.521 --> 33:47.660
I can't go to the reading room because I have to go to work

33:47.791 --> 33:49.021
Studying at home this time

33:49.190 --> 33:50.761
If you can't concentrate, sleep like this

33:51.190 --> 33:52.430
Sleep is the best medicine

33:52.930 --> 33:55.930
Don’t go to the mountains or riverside during the day

33:56.700 --> 33:57.970
Don't go to the dentist

33:58.301 --> 34:00.301
Don't go to dark places

34:00.871 --> 34:02.541
Don't trust anyone easily

34:02.801 --> 34:04.841
The bad guy comes with a smile

34:05.271 --> 34:08.209
Currently, my school friends

34:08.210 --> 34:09.881
think about it

34:10.150 --> 34:12.250
Wait three or four months until you are 20

34:12.511 --> 34:13.951
I'm free from now on

34:14.420 --> 34:17.350
- So...
- Let's study this time, teacher.

34:23.991 --> 34:24.991
open book

34:29.201 --> 34:31.470

34:37.011 --> 34:38.240
Nickname of Prince Wuer

34:38.241 --> 34:40.181
Unless you don't listen,
do you have to listen every time?

34:42.310 --> 34:43.381
so terrible

34:43.451 --> 34:45.380
don't just say too much

34:45.381 --> 34:46.620
It is also known as Dom Prince

34:49.120 --> 34:50.150
don't tell me

34:52.020 --> 34:54.091
So why does every name have to
include prince?

34:57.131 --> 34:58.230
How could I not add it?

34:59.031 --> 35:01.099
To write Yunbe Ochunga

35:01.100 --> 35:02.801
Learn how to use it

35:03.400 --> 35:05.971
Features that are different from Yoongi Ochunga

35:06.170 --> 35:07.670
the form described

35:09.841 --> 35:11.040
must understand

35:11.440 --> 35:12.471
Now first

35:12.940 --> 35:15.641
Let’s talk about Yunbi Ochung’s net worth

35:15.841 --> 35:17.580
as i said yesterday

35:18.111 --> 35:20.180
First written in our words by Yonbe Ochunga

35:20.181 --> 35:21.850
a long poem

35:21.920 --> 35:23.890
Because it is reflected in music and literature

35:23.891 --> 35:25.920
Korean literature is valuable

35:26.221 --> 35:27.919
This work is from the late Goryeo Dynasty

35:27.920 --> 35:30.189
In studying the early Korean language

35:30.190 --> 35:33.330
Has historical value..

35:38.201 --> 35:39.741
- Hello sir
- Hello sir

35:43.571 --> 35:45.641
Mom...Grandpa hates me

35:49.511 --> 35:51.150
I hate people who fight too

35:51.480 --> 35:53.750
I said so much because I am calm

35:54.221 --> 35:57.721
I've been losing UFC fights since day one

35:59.290 --> 36:01.790
Let’s do our own thing and
don’t criticize each other

36:02.391 --> 36:03.891
that's what i said

36:05.060 --> 36:07.701
Don’t look too closely during class

36:14.571 --> 36:16.200
You can't go anywhere after graduation.

36:16.201 --> 36:18.741
Stay in the classroom
because I'm going to call you

36:20.080 --> 36:21.840
- Teacher
- Yes

36:21.841 --> 36:22.881
go where you have to go

36:23.111 --> 36:24.181
Wow

36:24.681 --> 36:25.781
Do you talk very intimately?

36:27.821 --> 36:29.181
Thank you so much

36:30.850 --> 36:32.650
Thank you for your compliments on your homework

36:34.020 --> 36:35.891
I say well written because it is well written

36:36.391 --> 36:37.861
It's not a matter of gratitude

36:37.960 --> 36:40.400
This time I was a little shy to show it

36:41.861 --> 36:43.700
In fact, I later

36:43.701 --> 36:45.770
Do you think you could be a novelist?

36:46.100 --> 36:47.201
certainly

36:47.641 --> 36:49.641
Even if it takes too long, it will take too long

36:50.011 --> 36:51.810
I don’t know if it will be very popular.

36:52.841 --> 36:54.111
so work hard

37:09.761 --> 37:11.091
Do you know Jimmy Zu?

37:13.900 --> 37:15.960
This is a best-selling author

37:17.931 --> 37:19.870
(academic points)

37:23.040 --> 37:24.511
Not in the bathroom either

37:26.881 --> 37:27.940
Where will it go?

37:34.721 --> 37:35.821
Did you bring it?

37:37.150 --> 37:38.190
Excellent

37:38.690 --> 37:39.721
Excellent

37:40.391 --> 37:42.391
I fixed some existing sentences

37:43.060 --> 37:46.330
The content is also
fixed

37:52.230 --> 37:54.270
You are already tired from doing homework

38:12.391 --> 38:13.420
but

38:14.861 --> 38:16.960
Almost all the lines I wrote
were deleted

38:25.531 --> 38:27.801
Oh, that's it

38:28.971 --> 38:30.011
It doesn't matter

38:31.741 --> 38:34.080
Because that will be a good result

38:34.641 --> 38:37.181
Anyway, I wrote the original work

38:39.111 --> 38:41.620
The thing is, anyone can do it

38:42.551 --> 38:43.591
Isn't it?

38:45.350 --> 38:47.790
Well, yes, of course

38:51.091 --> 38:52.460
So come out quickly

38:53.701 --> 38:54.701
Excellent

39:12.850 --> 39:15.080
Because good results come from your hands

39:15.681 --> 39:17.420
I have no general complaints

39:19.620 --> 39:20.891
Corrected

39:21.391 --> 39:22.420
anyone can do it

39:24.161 --> 39:26.289
(Storage Room)

39:26.290 --> 39:28.100
(Always pay attention to fire prevention)

39:47.350 --> 39:49.181
I've always done this

39:52.190 --> 39:54.290
I wonder
if it's the same for you

39:58.661 --> 40:01.500
Can you write without help ?

40:03.161 --> 40:04.729
Although I have watched it for six years

40:04.730 --> 40:06.399
Even if it’s just a little homework

40:06.400 --> 40:09.100
I'm surprised others hired and got it done

40:10.611 --> 40:12.939
If you really think anyone can do it

40:12.940 --> 40:14.841
Why do you have to do it yourself?

40:15.141 --> 40:16.709
Leverage other people's skills

40:16.710 --> 40:17.881
Are you that bald?

40:20.721 --> 40:22.420
No, not bald

40:25.951 --> 40:27.820
I think it's embarrassing

40:27.821 --> 40:29.690
Hiding in this place?

40:32.431 --> 40:33.531
Such a thing

40:34.960 --> 40:37.201
At least here,
it can't be a secret

40:40.940 --> 40:42.040
Let's go to the teacher's office

41:02.361 --> 41:03.391
Misu, are you okay?

41:11.201 --> 41:12.270
this..

41:15.141 --> 41:16.571
I want to do it

41:19.770 --> 41:22.241
Class is about to start, come on

41:24.011 --> 41:25.181
Let's go to Mizu

41:52.341 --> 41:53.640
how to really do it

41:53.641 --> 41:56.011
Why can't my mother move like this?

41:57.150 --> 41:58.810
There must be something there

42:06.891 --> 42:08.560
This is the first face I've ever seen

42:11.190 --> 42:13.290
A room in the upper class?

42:20.870 --> 42:23.071
Is Lee Sun-el in your room?

42:24.141 --> 42:26.781
Sun El Sun El Why?

42:28.411 --> 42:29.841
he..

42:30.611 --> 42:33.051
Can you give me this?

42:36.891 --> 42:37.951
I trust you

42:46.290 --> 42:49.100
Now you know how fishy this is

42:52.100 --> 42:53.769
Go to the corridor where the girls' classroom is

42:53.770 --> 42:54.841
Don’t you know not to cut it?

42:55.701 --> 42:57.111
Are school rules a joke?

42:57.971 --> 43:01.011
no i'm sorry

43:01.611 --> 43:03.850
- Please forgive me once
- Come on

43:15.861 --> 43:17.729
(Copyrighted invention)

43:17.730 --> 43:19.631
(Let us move forward with wisdom)

43:23.000 --> 43:24.571
- Did you come back?
- Tarta

43:27.270 --> 43:30.611
If Wumisu is really as
far away as the novels written by my mother

43:31.741 --> 43:33.741
Today's question is just the beginning

43:46.420 --> 43:49.391
I can't even sleep because it makes me feel so uncomfortable

43:52.960 --> 43:55.460
(Let us give up ourselves and
love each other)

43:56.131 --> 43:57.900
Why is it taking so long?

43:59.701 --> 44:01.870
don't go anywhere and wait

44:16.181 --> 44:17.250
Be careful

44:19.190 --> 44:20.190
What

44:21.491 --> 44:22.861
Yun Yang, be careful

44:39.741 --> 44:40.911
Do you really want to go to this place?

44:41.310 --> 44:43.580
The principal said today's dinner was really...

44:43.650 --> 44:45.550
Even if it rains, the earth will split in two

44:45.551 --> 44:47.451
I was told I had to attend

44:48.721 --> 44:51.221
I've been talking a lot since before

44:52.190 --> 44:53.190
so?

44:55.460 --> 44:58.391
How much do you
know about the principal who has just been here a month?

44:59.960 --> 45:01.000
so

45:01.460 --> 45:03.971
Why
would the principal fall in love with such a person?

45:06.270 --> 45:07.500
Sorry, I'm late

45:10.471 --> 45:11.540
No?

45:23.620 --> 45:24.620
What

45:25.750 --> 45:28.161
Are you not as smart as I thought?

45:33.900 --> 45:34.960
being threatened

45:36.301 --> 45:38.801
Horrible people to work with

45:39.701 --> 45:41.470
that warning

45:41.471 --> 45:43.500
Until now,
I don’t know how Shan’e was restrained, but I listened carefully

45:44.911 --> 45:46.340
What you have done so far

45:46.341 --> 45:48.980
All the cowardly things he did to get ahead

45:49.440 --> 45:51.210
It won't be what you want anymore

45:52.750 --> 45:55.181
I will stop everything no matter what

46:03.420 --> 46:04.491
Yes

46:11.971 --> 46:13.031
Misu

46:38.431 --> 46:40.560
Where are you going?

46:42.861 --> 46:45.631
A chapter from the senior year
to the freshmen

46:52.210 --> 46:54.241
Let's see what we do here

46:54.440 --> 46:55.881
Mom told me to come back early

47:01.721 --> 47:04.620
I have a place where I can go in for a while,
but I’m going back today

47:13.931 --> 47:15.100
He Wuguang

47:29.080 --> 47:31.210
Do you think my sister ran away like this?

47:34.250 --> 47:36.019
No eavesdropping allowed

47:36.020 --> 47:37.821
When the windows are opened due to cloudy weather

47:40.290 --> 47:41.761
So even if it hurts

47:42.790 --> 47:44.661
I don't know anything about Mitsu's method

47:47.400 --> 47:48.959
if you want to fight

47:48.960 --> 47:51.471
Shouldn't you be sure of the other person's situation
?

47:56.870 --> 47:58.210
Which way do you want to go?

48:00.841 --> 48:03.210
Then give it to new classmates

48:03.781 --> 48:05.381
I want to write a message

48:06.580 --> 48:09.579
Hey, do you have a girlfriend?

48:09.580 --> 48:13.350
Hey, people change all the time,
you know?

48:13.761 --> 48:16.190
if i see a beautiful girl

48:16.460 --> 48:19.290
Brave girlfriend first...

48:23.261 --> 48:24.330
I just gave

48:24.770 --> 48:26.599
I tried it first

48:26.600 --> 48:29.169
A guy who can't even lift weights

48:29.170 --> 48:31.370
I just need to ask for the phone number

48:31.770 --> 48:34.310
It would be fine if the head teacher didn't stop me

48:36.511 --> 48:37.551
Well

48:41.480 --> 48:44.451
I'll go find the head teacher tomorrow

48:44.690 --> 48:46.620
- cool
guy

48:47.020 --> 48:48.761
"What's your home phone number?"

48:49.391 --> 48:53.091
Yes 53 2355

48:53.261 --> 48:57.000
What 53 2355

48:57.870 --> 48:59.471
i heard somewhere

49:00.301 --> 49:03.500
Hey,
isn't this the head teacher's phone number?

49:04.210 --> 49:07.040
Well, our
new student

49:08.011 --> 49:10.451
If you remember, give me a call and I'll take care of it

49:15.650 --> 49:16.850
Come back soon

49:30.571 --> 49:33.900
(Let's use it as a private toilet)

49:34.100 --> 49:35.100
How to do it?

49:51.850 --> 49:54.790
I don't think so, but it
won't be an umbrella

49:57.861 --> 50:00.031
As a student, can I say whatever I want?

50:01.400 --> 50:02.500
I am 22 years old

50:04.270 --> 50:05.330
oh yes

50:09.870 --> 50:12.841
So, what does this word mean?

50:14.210 --> 50:16.741
I
know very little about the Five Lights Dharma

50:19.750 --> 50:21.051
I said I was threatened

50:22.381 --> 50:24.249
If you really feel this way

50:24.250 --> 50:26.120
Probably not a real threat

50:27.091 --> 50:29.761
This is a casual test

50:30.631 --> 50:31.661
Is this a test?

50:32.330 --> 50:33.431
Is there such a thing?

50:34.000 --> 50:36.161
Which button does it respond to when pressed?

50:36.761 --> 50:38.330
What are the disadvantages?

50:39.270 --> 50:41.641
Is there something as useful as a secret card?

50:42.801 --> 50:46.111
Mizu didn't attack at all until she fully understood this

50:46.710 --> 50:47.980
but if you know

50:50.850 --> 50:51.951
it's over

50:58.391 --> 50:59.491
threaten..

51:00.091 --> 51:02.591
Horrible people to work with

51:07.261 --> 51:08.431
Yes

51:09.500 --> 51:10.571
Be careful

51:12.531 --> 51:13.600
What

51:14.870 --> 51:16.301
Yun Yang, be careful

51:18.210 --> 51:19.511
as a sister

51:20.781 --> 51:23.710
You said this when you first met me

51:28.520 --> 51:29.721
looks dangerous

51:30.891 --> 51:33.091
When you look at a goal and
move forward

51:33.721 --> 51:35.560
This is a common trap

52:17.000 --> 52:18.071
How are you?

52:23.100 --> 52:24.870
That's why you have to be careful

52:43.960 --> 52:45.060
let's get into consciousness

52:45.391 --> 52:46.491
drink slowly

53:19.431 --> 53:22.330
this is gonna be really crazy

53:29.440 --> 53:31.010
Don't look at it like that

53:31.011 --> 53:33.511
This is not a dangerous place in our house.

53:35.681 --> 53:37.580
It's just that the method is wrong

53:38.511 --> 53:39.551
This is not ordinary

53:40.210 --> 53:42.321
Let's have a drink and enjoy

53:43.451 --> 53:45.690
I like you

53:54.730 --> 53:56.560
Do you know this, Wu Guang?

53:58.500 --> 54:00.801
I can't say, but I can know

54:01.301 --> 54:02.600
Maybe you just pretend not to know

54:04.310 --> 54:05.870
This means it's not the first time

54:13.750 --> 54:15.451
It means it will be fine soon

54:33.730 --> 54:34.770
Mother

54:36.141 --> 54:37.571
This is a sad picture

54:49.650 --> 54:51.091
will be very convenient

55:22.181 --> 55:23.681
Who are you looking for?

55:34.301 --> 55:35.531
This guy

55:39.900 --> 55:40.971
This guy

55:47.071 --> 55:48.080
How are you?

55:55.980 --> 55:57.080
Come

56:19.611 --> 56:21.841
Did you tell me to trust you
?

56:22.281 --> 56:23.281
please

56:26.210 --> 56:27.551
not really

56:27.821 --> 56:28.980
I am strong

56:29.681 --> 56:30.920
Please trust me

56:31.290 --> 56:32.920
Then let's meet in Wuzhengli

56:33.420 --> 56:35.891
Because I'll tell you what it means

56:36.520 --> 56:38.391
keep living and hold on

56:39.031 --> 56:40.190
I'm afraid he won't come

56:40.730 --> 56:43.631
I'm still worried that I won't be able to come

56:55.440 --> 56:56.480
listen carefully

56:57.951 --> 57:00.580
From now on your life will be absolute hell

57:01.281 --> 57:03.180
I
never took my eyes off you for a moment

57:03.181 --> 57:04.620
Because I will watch until the end

57:05.650 --> 57:07.419
If you have debt to pay

57:07.420 --> 57:08.520
no matter what

57:08.721 --> 57:11.031
