"The Stranger I Met"
Episode 14

00:16.549 --> 00:19.090
(Wu Gang Dumu)

00:28.799 --> 00:31.499
(Kyung Gi Joo)

00:40.880 --> 00:43.980
"A Stranger I Met"

00:45.350 --> 00:46.979
What happened in the village...

00:46.980 --> 00:49.480
I found the defendants in those cases

00:49.920 --> 00:51.550
He saw himself killing someone

00:52.590 --> 00:53.788
my brother

00:53.789 --> 00:55.159
(Excerpted from previous episodes)

00:55.160 --> 00:56.788
- I finally got this guy.
- Ma'am.

00:56.789 --> 00:58.329
The culprit is not Wuguang

00:58.490 --> 01:00.629
Not the defendant, but the witness

01:00.630 --> 01:01.729
The defendant is a male

01:01.730 --> 01:04.700
The only person who recognizes his face is
Hou Guang

01:08.069 --> 01:09.838
- Mr. Yin
- Mr. Liu Fan

01:09.839 --> 01:11.209
sunshine air

01:11.640 --> 01:12.669
it won't happen

01:16.479 --> 01:18.380
Li Sheng'er, hurry up

01:24.649 --> 01:25.819
mr san el

01:27.250 --> 01:28.520
Another person died

01:28.919 --> 01:30.319
This time it's a student

01:30.459 --> 01:32.329
A good boy
died in an abandoned house

01:32.330 --> 01:33.989
Otherwise, Li Sheng'e will die.

01:33.990 --> 01:35.359
If only because of the teacher

01:35.360 --> 01:36.929
I almost fell in love with the murderer

01:41.069 --> 01:42.100
(Bangbang Teahouse)

01:43.669 --> 01:45.309
how long have you been here?

01:46.209 --> 01:47.209
(Bangbang Teahouse)

01:48.610 --> 01:50.809
(I'm glad I remembered and
saw you again)

01:51.080 --> 01:54.750
(Episode 14: The person who makes you happy)

Article (14)

01:57.179 --> 02:00.720
(Wujiang Hospital)

02:08.530 --> 02:10.729
A bald, disgusting guy.

02:10.899 --> 02:12.430
Where do you think you are from?

02:13.000 --> 02:16.370
Where did you come from, threatening me with such information
?

02:16.799 --> 02:19.609
I'll see that bald guy's
face

02:19.910 --> 02:21.609
- Calm down and get up there
- Madam.

02:23.180 --> 02:24.910
shameless

02:26.280 --> 02:28.519
Yin Yongsheng

02:28.850 --> 02:30.850
Let's go to our house now

02:31.850 --> 02:32.919
Yes

02:35.819 --> 02:37.519
that crazy guy

02:38.389 --> 02:40.359
That guy is not a very
bold person

02:41.259 --> 02:44.199
Have you reached this point and still left threatening letters?

02:46.223 --> 02:49.340
He is not afraid of being
caught

02:49.470 --> 02:50.539
This is...

02:52.940 --> 02:54.269
Do you think so?

02:56.739 --> 02:58.979
In my opinion
this is the complete opposite

03:02.419 --> 03:05.590
This guy is totally scared now because
he's afraid of getting caught

03:06.549 --> 03:08.120
After any threat

03:08.489 --> 03:10.190
I need to shut that girl up

03:13.030 --> 03:14.359
this is the first time

03:14.699 --> 03:16.430
I couldn't kill anyone

03:17.329 --> 03:20.569
He was shocked by the fact that the victim was still alive

03:32.180 --> 03:33.910
But why are there only two detectives?

03:34.979 --> 03:36.279
- Well
- in this village...

03:36.280 --> 03:37.949
Is there anything more important than this?

03:39.690 --> 03:42.359
When I opened the complaint,
why did only two detectives come?

03:45.259 --> 03:47.590
That is...

03:48.799 --> 03:51.430
The police don't want this to become a big deal

03:52.569 --> 03:53.699
This time too

04:10.880 --> 04:12.889
Does it make sense for us to go alone
?

04:13.250 --> 04:14.989
Even if all the detectives were gone,
it wouldn't be enough

04:15.389 --> 04:17.589
The defendant went to the hospital

04:17.590 --> 04:18.630
Who says this is the culprit?

04:20.890 --> 04:22.728
-What did someone say in this message?

04:22.729 --> 04:24.029
What if I'm kidding?

04:24.030 --> 04:25.900
Why
did you conclude that you were the culprit?

04:28.439 --> 04:30.739
Go quietly, don't alert people, it's free

04:30.900 --> 04:33.139
Bring me that little piece of paper right now

04:33.140 --> 04:35.410
I'll do a test, okay?

04:41.350 --> 04:43.520
(Lee Sun-Ah kidnapping case file)

04:59.570 --> 05:01.640
(Bangbang Teahouse)

05:05.640 --> 05:07.910
Anyway,
what can you do to cause trouble for the boy who was arrested?

05:08.479 --> 05:09.979
Don't tell me about the promotion to police chief

05:10.379 --> 05:13.450
Even now, the position is uncertain,
so that means he can't give us much time

05:14.010 --> 05:15.350
So what can I do?

05:15.679 --> 05:17.149
The one who was arrested was Gominsu

05:17.150 --> 05:18.220
I have to be the culprit

05:19.049 --> 05:21.590
Lee Joo-young and Lee Kyung-a
were killed by Go Min-soo

05:21.859 --> 05:23.589
The last case is another person's
hand

05:23.590 --> 05:24.729
Yes of course

05:24.890 --> 05:28.830
If so, we
can solve at least one case

05:29.499 --> 05:31.600
But although I can't find any evidence of Yu Bum Yong

05:31.900 --> 05:35.140
That student, Lee Sun Else,
has witnesses.

05:35.470 --> 05:36.539
same handwriting

05:36.970 --> 05:38.869
"Women who read are dangerous
"

05:39.439 --> 05:43.010
This makes sense if there is no written explanation

05:43.679 --> 05:45.579
So the note I found in the hospital room today
...

05:45.580 --> 05:47.780
This is something that doesn't exist

05:53.590 --> 05:57.119
(Congratulations on hosting the 1988 Seoul Olympics)

06:07.799 --> 06:11.369
Thank you very much for sending me,
Detective.

06:11.770 --> 06:12.939
It doesn't matter

06:14.309 --> 06:17.079
So the question tonight

06:17.080 --> 06:19.350
I can't tell anyone right now

06:19.679 --> 06:21.320
May interfere with investigation

06:21.749 --> 06:23.350
Do you get me?

06:23.450 --> 06:24.789
certainly

06:25.020 --> 06:29.059
Detective, arrest the murderer as soon as possible

06:29.689 --> 06:30.689
Yes

06:34.030 --> 06:35.229
Why is this so?

06:37.929 --> 06:39.629
among those who came to ask for news

06:40.770 --> 06:42.400
The defendant may be present

06:45.010 --> 06:46.570
Who came looking for it?

06:47.710 --> 06:49.010
Why don't you ask?

06:49.410 --> 06:52.709
this is just a program

06:52.710 --> 06:54.009
if you wait

06:54.010 --> 06:55.580
How long do you have to wait?

06:56.450 --> 06:58.989
How do you plan to handle this case?

07:00.820 --> 07:02.960
He even received threatening messages from the defendant

07:03.960 --> 07:07.660
Just get it home and
that's the end of it, isn't it?

07:13.499 --> 07:16.439
I'll go to camp and confirm

07:41.189 --> 07:43.760
(The 5th Wujingli Fireworks Festival)

07:46.629 --> 07:49.999
(TV prep time)

08:52.029 --> 08:54.529
Where are you going? Why come now?

08:55.499 --> 08:58.970
I think I can find a way
to face you

09:00.470 --> 09:01.639
Are they inside?

09:02.979 --> 09:04.180
Come in and talk

09:15.889 --> 09:17.489
Is this news?

09:17.659 --> 09:18.690
Yes

09:19.159 --> 09:22.460
What happened last night
was included in the news

09:26.499 --> 09:28.670
After being discharged from hospital yesterday

09:28.970 --> 09:30.399
I went around the whole village

09:31.540 --> 09:33.609
But neither the villagers nor the police

09:34.509 --> 09:37.210
The surroundings were quiet, as if nothing had happened

09:39.450 --> 09:43.249
This silence is not safe for Sun-e

09:44.149 --> 09:46.649
Not only that,
he also received threatening messages from the defendant

09:47.320 --> 09:49.889
There's not even a police guard in front of this house.

09:52.759 --> 09:56.700
Now
we need to get as much public involvement in this case as possible

09:59.044 --> 10:01.290
The police
should investigate more actively

10:02.639 --> 10:04.909
If the police
are unwilling to do this

10:05.340 --> 10:06.869
we have to make it happen

10:08.440 --> 10:11.749
I think the most accurate way is in the news

10:14.479 --> 10:16.450
If we
identify previous cases

10:16.979 --> 10:19.290
The police can no longer investigate

10:20.090 --> 10:21.859
If the police have started an investigation

10:22.820 --> 10:25.729
The defendant will not approach Sun Al easily again.

10:28.129 --> 10:31.199
At present, all this is to ensure
the safety of Sun Aier

10:31.200 --> 10:34.229
I think this is the only way to catch the culprit

10:34.499 --> 10:35.700
but...

10:37.100 --> 10:38.540
this way

10:38.970 --> 10:41.979
Shouldn't Son El
be in the news herself?

10:42.580 --> 10:45.249
The victim's interview went like this

10:46.279 --> 10:48.379
I know exactly what you're worried about

10:48.979 --> 10:50.778
face and voice

10:50.779 --> 10:52.619
I have to do this so I don't even remember Sun El

10:53.249 --> 10:55.989
I know journalists who would do that.

10:58.259 --> 11:01.729
I believe Mr. Yin,
but...

11:02.859 --> 11:04.600
Even if you cover your voice and face like that

11:05.170 --> 11:08.369
No one else knows, but
the defendant knows

11:11.040 --> 11:13.139
this is about my daughter

11:14.470 --> 11:16.940
This
may be more dangerous

11:18.279 --> 11:21.379
To be honest, I don't want to

11:44.070 --> 11:45.840
for my teacher

11:46.509 --> 11:48.479
You've never cooked, have you?

11:55.279 --> 11:57.820
I've always wanted to cook it once

11:58.190 --> 12:02.219
Prepared hastily,
although there is not much curry

12:02.220 --> 12:03.320
Participation

12:03.920 --> 12:05.359
How was the food?

12:06.460 --> 12:07.560
Yes

12:15.070 --> 12:16.739
one way or another

12:18.470 --> 12:19.739
The worst situation

12:23.409 --> 12:26.950
Even though something as sad as this
happened to my child

12:28.050 --> 12:32.350
Feed your family no matter what

12:33.119 --> 12:34.889
A mother's feelings

12:35.659 --> 12:38.090
Even though Mr. Yin is not my son

12:38.629 --> 12:42.600
I think this is our family

12:43.200 --> 12:44.359
if not

12:44.859 --> 12:47.028
At the same time we

12:47.029 --> 12:51.070
care, think, worry,
help

12:51.470 --> 12:53.170
can you do it?

12:53.310 --> 12:56.310
As the teacher said, this is other people's business

12:57.310 --> 12:58.850
other people's business

12:59.479 --> 13:00.649
that's why

13:01.249 --> 13:06.190
If such a teacher really
thinks this information is important

13:07.749 --> 13:09.259
i want to believe

13:10.889 --> 13:14.259
keep us safe

13:15.100 --> 13:17.299
Can you do the same thing?

13:17.300 --> 13:18.399
Miss

13:18.670 --> 13:22.269
You know what the police have told us the most so far?

13:22.600 --> 13:25.710
"Keep calm and quiet."

13:26.340 --> 13:29.739
Has anyone been able to resolve this issue so far?

13:30.779 --> 13:32.278
If you do nothing because you are afraid

13:32.279 --> 13:33.350
we are all here

13:33.810 --> 13:36.220
How long is he going to hide like this?

13:39.550 --> 13:42.389
I want to do what is reported in the news

13:46.729 --> 13:48.899
I want to do it too

13:51.629 --> 13:53.930
Because it's not me who's wrong

13:55.769 --> 13:57.600
he should be afraid

13:58.239 --> 14:01.239
Because I'm not the culprit

14:09.220 --> 14:11.689
Although it will be difficult for the family

14:11.690 --> 14:14.489
This is an important interview,
please do it well

14:15.790 --> 14:17.719
Good focus shot of mother and daughter

14:17.720 --> 14:21.159
- Be sure to wear a press jacket
- Yes

14:21.700 --> 14:24.258
Be sure to chew on your face

14:24.259 --> 14:26.800
The sound must also
change radically

14:28.269 --> 14:31.398
The audience wants to know
the face of the perpetrator, not the face of the victim.

14:31.399 --> 14:32.470
I'm sure

14:33.440 --> 14:36.310
It would be better if it could be displayed directly

14:36.540 --> 14:38.680
Last night’s matchbox and text message

14:39.080 --> 14:40.648
The police have taken it, haven't they?

14:40.649 --> 14:42.518
Yes, everything is imported

14:42.519 --> 14:43.679
Yes I know

14:43.680 --> 14:45.549
I would start shooting the same way

14:45.550 --> 14:47.690
Let's start interviewing reporter Gin

14:58.999 --> 15:00.700
what are you doing here?

15:01.570 --> 15:04.670
So what are you doing there
?

15:08.810 --> 15:10.109
(Bangbang Teahouse)

15:18.950 --> 15:22.790
What if the case becomes public while the police are still investigating ?

15:23.090 --> 15:24.389
without witnesses

15:25.790 --> 15:30.159
Was the witness just
smuggled out like this?

15:31.930 --> 15:35.700
Because I don't know when and how the place inside will be destroyed

15:37.700 --> 15:39.169
you are right

15:39.170 --> 15:41.739
People from the future
don't lie

15:42.840 --> 15:46.249
But we didn't expect things to get that bad

15:50.279 --> 15:52.018
One more thing has really disappeared

15:52.019 --> 15:53.519
(Lee Sun-Ah kidnapping case file)

15:56.359 --> 15:58.389
When student Li Shanyi
ran away from the abandoned house

15:58.690 --> 16:02.159
The information in my pocket
is gone

16:04.200 --> 16:06.369
You know what this means, right?

16:09.139 --> 16:10.470
That's why you called, right?

16:11.040 --> 16:12.440
radio reporter

16:16.080 --> 16:18.379
I would never allow it to be overwritten like this

16:19.850 --> 16:21.879
it will still be bubbly

16:24.519 --> 16:26.518
leader

16:26.519 --> 16:27.989
- Leader
- What?

16:29.190 --> 16:30.658
from Seoul Broadcasting Station

16:30.659 --> 16:33.389
Looks like they're looking into this case everywhere

16:33.430 --> 16:35.528
Now the whole village is boiling

16:35.529 --> 16:37.060
Is he a broadcaster from Seoul?

16:37.159 --> 16:39.330
One..Two..Three will start

16:39.729 --> 16:42.368
Rated as a crime-free village for five consecutive years

16:42.369 --> 16:43.369
Yu Zhongjian Yu Zhongyu

16:43.370 --> 16:44.599
In Wuzhong Village

16:44.600 --> 16:47.608
There have been three murders in the past 30 days

16:47.609 --> 16:49.539
The village will become increasingly noisy

16:49.540 --> 16:53.108
The suspect in the brutal murders of two women last May

16:53.109 --> 16:57.079
Each corpse
left its own symbol

16:57.080 --> 17:00.319
One of
the text messages was what he wanted to say.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.789
I put it in this matchbox

17:01.790 --> 17:03.819
Matchboxes
are mostly used by young people in the village

17:03.820 --> 17:05.330
Posted from teahouse

17:05.489 --> 17:07.489
Based on this information, the police

17:07.560 --> 17:09.499
The defendant often went in and out of ordinary teahouses

17:09.500 --> 17:12.168
Assuming it must be a young man from the same village

17:12.169 --> 17:14.198
The biggest culprit among consumers...

17:14.199 --> 17:17.300
Everyone
talks about the culprit every day

17:18.069 --> 17:21.878
Surely the culprit somewhere
will see it too

17:21.879 --> 17:23.009
Because the defendant has not been arrested yet

17:23.010 --> 17:24.479
Although the whole village is worried

17:24.480 --> 17:26.948
Judging from the murder that happened again in s

17:26.949 --> 17:28.549
surviving
victim

17:28.550 --> 17:31.479
He was reportedly threatened again by the defendant

17:31.480 --> 17:33.619
The whole village is in panic

17:38.260 --> 17:40.560
when i see this handwriting

17:41.459 --> 17:43.159
If you didn't know, the defendant

17:43.429 --> 17:47.070
I feel like someone is watching me

17:48.129 --> 17:52.240
Even so, the police
have not taken any action

17:52.310 --> 17:54.669
Is that how it should be?

17:55.310 --> 17:57.179
Our police here

17:57.609 --> 18:00.050
to protect victims

18:00.209 --> 18:01.919
Will try my best to do my best

18:01.949 --> 18:04.649
Things
will slowly start to change

18:07.449 --> 18:11.090
If you see anything suspicious
please report it to me

18:11.419 --> 18:12.959
Hello

18:13.659 --> 18:16.729
We
will be waiting in front of you 24 hours a day

18:16.730 --> 18:18.159
it's sad

18:19.770 --> 18:21.729
Although it has been a month since the investigation

18:21.730 --> 18:23.540
no progress?

18:24.500 --> 18:27.240
of course not

18:27.540 --> 18:32.050
We
have arrested the main suspect

18:32.550 --> 18:36.118
We plan to turn him over to the investigative office as soon as possible

18:36.119 --> 18:39.589
We must change what has not changed

18:39.590 --> 18:42.159
you can stay calm

18:42.790 --> 18:44.590
Either cover up the case

18:44.719 --> 18:48.030
Finally, it looks like they'll make Gominsu the culprit

18:49.629 --> 18:52.270
Anyway, as long as he's caught

18:52.770 --> 18:54.869
A thorough investigation is impossible

18:56.770 --> 18:58.909
As for Hou Guang,
hasn’t he said anything yet?

19:03.780 --> 19:05.750
what are you talking about?

19:06.810 --> 19:09.379
I've never really lied, detective.

19:09.480 --> 19:10.619
Five Flavors Award

19:11.949 --> 19:16.790
Do you know how dangerous it is to lie to the police
?

19:17.359 --> 19:20.830
Even now, if you tell the truth,
you pretend not to know your mistake

19:21.560 --> 19:24.959
This is the last chance my uncle gave me

19:25.230 --> 19:28.169
By the time the real culprit is found it's too late

19:28.939 --> 19:32.540
I don't know what crime you would be charged with.

19:32.869 --> 19:35.269
I have to call my lonely brother a murderer

19:35.270 --> 19:36.840
Do you think it's easy?

19:37.340 --> 19:39.049
With
the guilt of killing his family

19:39.050 --> 19:40.809
Hesitation and thinking countless times every day

19:40.810 --> 19:42.550
He said quite a bit

19:44.750 --> 19:46.850
If you doubt me like this

19:50.820 --> 19:52.560
I really found it

19:54.990 --> 19:56.959
That day, my brother was by the river

19:57.030 --> 19:59.569
It seems that Gominsu is not the culprit

19:59.570 --> 20:01.129
if you show evidence

20:02.300 --> 20:03.699
I would say I didn't see it

20:04.300 --> 20:07.840
For that kid, this
would be a last resort

20:09.780 --> 20:12.409
Now I can't wait for his answer

20:12.550 --> 20:14.208
The reporter asked more questions

20:14.209 --> 20:16.520
The police will work hard to end this matter as soon as possible

20:18.919 --> 20:20.750
If we use our method

20:21.490 --> 20:23.689
If you get confession after a few days,
you can get

20:24.320 --> 20:25.928
No matter
how rubbish it is

20:25.929 --> 20:28.060
It is impossible to ask her to pay for the crimes she committed

20:28.159 --> 20:30.399
That 's a good thing for the real culprit

20:32.730 --> 20:35.030
Yuguang
didn't even move.

20:36.300 --> 20:37.840
How can he rescue his brother?

20:40.070 --> 20:41.169
acre

20:42.280 --> 20:44.340
Can I meet him once?

20:47.350 --> 20:48.550
(Storage Room)

21:01.459 --> 21:04.799
Because there will be someone guarding the door

21:04.800 --> 21:06.330
Must be completed within 5 minutes

21:13.310 --> 21:14.510
Night of the 16th

21:15.810 --> 21:17.510
Do you remember what I encountered?

21:20.310 --> 21:22.379
How do you do it?

21:24.449 --> 21:25.490
I do not love

21:30.290 --> 21:32.530
Natale broke his arm

21:35.030 --> 21:37.199
I'm trying to get you out of here now

21:37.629 --> 21:40.600
Try to remember without thinking

21:41.699 --> 21:43.969
Where was he then and what did he do after that
?

21:49.510 --> 21:50.580
About Li Jing'e

21:52.010 --> 21:53.179
Will you tell the police?

21:57.449 --> 21:58.580
that night

22:00.020 --> 22:01.250
your hand is hurt

22:02.159 --> 22:03.359
How is it treated?

22:04.990 --> 22:06.330
Does gomisu help?

22:08.129 --> 22:09.199
Mitsu?

22:12.000 --> 22:13.730
Miss

22:17.070 --> 22:18.199
ha

22:23.580 --> 22:26.949
He's dying of thirst

22:27.879 --> 22:30.080
Go buy something to drink

22:32.850 --> 22:33.919
go

23:05.320 --> 23:06.990
Take a taxi

23:08.050 --> 23:09.919
I think I went to the hospital

23:12.230 --> 23:14.359
sometimes i feel sleepy

23:18.359 --> 23:19.570
Where did he go?

23:21.000 --> 23:22.169
Mitsu will know

23:25.070 --> 23:26.139
Every...

23:26.510 --> 23:28.270
(List of Yu Jongjian taxi drivers)

23:39.719 --> 23:40.820
Lapa

23:43.520 --> 23:44.689
I'm tired

23:44.889 --> 23:47.529
The caller just now
was Detective Shi Badong.

23:47.530 --> 23:49.158
Starting from the night of the 16th

23:49.159 --> 23:51.199
It was not until the morning of the 17th that
it was fully loaded with passengers.

23:51.429 --> 23:52.429
Yes

23:54.770 --> 23:57.070
Is it them?

24:13.889 --> 24:16.719
This is Go Min-soo, who the police say is the main suspect

24:16.919 --> 24:17.990
alibi

24:22.260 --> 24:23.459
(discharge certificate)

24:23.659 --> 24:24.898
(Medical Certificate)

24:24.899 --> 24:25.899
Miss

24:26.469 --> 24:29.740
No matter how well-informed you are,
where did you get this information?

24:30.340 --> 24:32.310
Is she really a Korean teacher?

24:32.439 --> 24:33.869
The image is not

24:35.310 --> 24:37.080
Look like people in our field

24:38.840 --> 24:40.709
How many minutes do you think it will be when it airs
?

24:41.209 --> 24:44.619
To be honest, at first
I thought it would take me a minute and a half

24:44.919 --> 24:47.820
But when I looked at it, it was only
three and five minutes.

24:48.219 --> 24:50.959
I'm more greedy
because I think that's not all I'm seeing now

24:51.189 --> 24:54.290
How about 20 minutes
?

24:54.760 --> 24:55.859
20 minutes?

24:58.330 --> 25:01.399
Mr. Yin seems not sure about the news

25:02.000 --> 25:03.639
have a certain form

25:03.939 --> 25:06.269
If you present a case for 20 minutes,
people...

25:06.270 --> 25:07.469
Will they get bored?

25:09.609 --> 25:11.709
Although I'm not sure

25:12.679 --> 25:15.209
I want to see a detailed presentation of news announcements

25:16.050 --> 25:18.119
there will be an audience

25:20.419 --> 25:24.419
Reporters
are all greedy to do this kind of thing

25:25.490 --> 25:28.359
Hey, isn't this
what you've always wanted to do?

25:29.560 --> 25:31.800
Shows only two 20-minute popular news stories

25:32.399 --> 25:35.899
Yes, but
how could I do such a thing...

25:36.439 --> 25:37.869
If you force yourself, it will happen

25:39.109 --> 25:40.209
May I?

25:40.709 --> 25:41.869
I think it'll be fine

25:42.480 --> 25:45.179
The working environment for broadcasters
just got better

25:45.639 --> 25:47.010
My time was really bad.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.780
in 1989

25:51.250 --> 25:53.319
Weekend news every 20 minutes

25:53.320 --> 25:55.889
They will select two stories and
conduct a detailed news announcement presentation

25:56.260 --> 25:59.489
When I was little I
said they had to do this

25:59.490 --> 26:02.030
Aren't you tired of saying that in my day ?

26:02.159 --> 26:05.869
Hey, do you know how groundbreaking this was in our broadcast history?

26:06.330 --> 26:07.369
this boy

26:08.869 --> 26:12.709
Can someone please clarify who wrote this history?

26:14.810 --> 26:16.540
This is what a news anchor should be like

26:16.580 --> 26:18.679
Clear,
not diminished at all

26:19.080 --> 26:20.449
This guy is cool

26:21.949 --> 26:23.280
can i do it?

26:23.480 --> 26:27.049
This will be a
true pioneer

26:27.050 --> 26:28.089
Yes, is it?

26:28.090 --> 26:29.389
tell the director

26:31.020 --> 26:33.060
The name is used for the fake image

26:33.530 --> 26:36.359
I will be hospitalized from the night of the 16th to the 18th

26:36.859 --> 26:39.570
If this is true,
there is no way Gominsu is a murderer

26:40.070 --> 26:41.699
It's absolutely impossible to be sure

26:43.369 --> 26:44.570
reporter

26:45.639 --> 26:46.869
I have to end my turn

26:47.909 --> 26:50.878
The main suspect is currently under police investigation

26:50.879 --> 26:52.449
Arrested Ge Minsu

26:52.609 --> 26:55.550
We have evidence that he had an alibi on the day of the incident

26:56.280 --> 26:57.850
I'll shoot as soon as the leader comes out

26:58.050 --> 26:59.389
come out and shoot

26:59.619 --> 27:02.119
- Can I be interviewed by the leader?
- I don't mind.

27:02.320 --> 27:05.219
Does the main suspect Goss really
have an alibi?

27:06.790 --> 27:07.990
how do you know?

27:08.060 --> 27:10.159
So where will the next investigation go?

27:10.330 --> 27:12.060
Are there any other suspects?

27:14.730 --> 27:16.799
Villagers
strengthen security in surrounding areas

27:16.800 --> 27:18.300
The program is now being requested...

27:18.639 --> 27:20.639
Responsible police investigation

27:20.810 --> 27:23.280
Restore the confidence of Wujingli villagers

27:23.439 --> 27:25.879
I think the villagers' suspicion
can be dispelled.

28:02.149 --> 28:03.149
What

28:11.090 --> 28:12.119
Why?

28:13.959 --> 28:15.530
Can I come in for a moment?

28:17.060 --> 28:19.300
- Hey, he's back
- Yes

28:19.369 --> 28:20.469
i will come soon

28:39.719 --> 28:40.790
Misu

28:41.619 --> 28:43.560
What are you doing standing there
?

28:54.169 --> 28:55.399
What are you doing?

29:03.939 --> 29:05.179
He Wuguang

29:39.510 --> 29:40.780
Who is this?

29:41.409 --> 29:43.719
Nice to meet you,
long time no see

29:56.530 --> 29:59.399
What are you doing Did you forget to make an appointment to meet me today?

30:05.070 --> 30:07.639
What, the two of them
are close now?

30:09.070 --> 30:10.209
Of course convenient

30:11.139 --> 30:12.340
they enter together

30:14.909 --> 30:16.750
Do you want to go back as soon as you are free?

30:24.159 --> 30:25.219
Won't you come?

30:33.030 --> 30:34.369
I'll go for a while

30:44.540 --> 30:47.250
Yes, I am confident today

30:48.250 --> 30:50.850
I'll see you when I get home

31:29.719 --> 31:31.020
Why help?

31:49.379 --> 31:50.679
that chain

31:52.040 --> 31:54.009
Whenever I feel cold, irritable, or
restless

31:54.010 --> 31:55.780
The necklace you once held

31:57.550 --> 32:00.750
My habit is
to notice it first

32:03.659 --> 32:05.219
that's why

32:13.169 --> 32:14.230
Are you OK?

32:16.369 --> 32:18.240
Gominsu is now free

32:30.449 --> 32:32.449
Are you crying now?

32:34.050 --> 32:37.260
When I see others in pain,
I don't exist at all, do I?

32:38.990 --> 32:41.459
I don’t know why I’m here
on this cold river bank

32:42.290 --> 32:44.899
I also met Mrs. Li who died unjustly...

32:45.699 --> 32:49.669
Even if you see your classmates
grieving the loss of their sister

32:51.699 --> 32:54.169
I'm just trying to use it to your advantage, aren't I?

32:55.639 --> 32:57.709
I did it and now I'm in tears

33:51.659 --> 33:52.760
Wait a moment

33:59.510 --> 34:01.708
I won't care about this

34:01.709 --> 34:03.080
Is it important?

34:04.010 --> 34:06.949
Why do girls wear children's clothes?

34:07.379 --> 34:08.579
look ma'am

34:08.580 --> 34:11.320
Lots of baby clothes and shoes?

34:11.419 --> 34:12.850
Is it because she's pregnant?

34:13.650 --> 34:15.819
like mother and son

34:18.790 --> 34:19.889
this

34:22.029 --> 34:23.330
don't throw away

34:23.699 --> 34:25.230
Throw away the rest

34:25.860 --> 34:26.900
That's cool

34:50.860 --> 34:52.789
I also want to know how the case is progressing

34:52.790 --> 34:54.130
I call it anxiety

34:54.889 --> 34:57.429
I heard noises in the village,
are you okay?

34:59.799 --> 35:02.299
This is what his grandson did

35:06.100 --> 35:08.739
If I think it's dangerous, I have to stop it

35:09.469 --> 35:11.079
This person is not free

35:11.080 --> 35:13.710
What if creating a problem makes people pay attention to him and want to know about him?

35:14.279 --> 35:17.319
But because of him, many problems
have been solved

35:17.619 --> 35:20.119
Student Seon-e is now
under police protection

35:20.350 --> 35:23.860
And the cases where innocent people were accused of being the culprits stopped there.

35:26.630 --> 35:28.528
enough

35:28.529 --> 35:30.730
Now all that's left is for the police to do

35:34.500 --> 35:36.299
Are you listening to me now?

35:37.100 --> 35:38.100
look ma'am

35:38.101 --> 35:41.068
Lots of baby clothes and shoes?

35:41.069 --> 35:42.440
Is it because she's pregnant?

35:45.580 --> 35:46.850
this

35:47.449 --> 35:48.880
don't throw away

35:49.150 --> 35:50.580
Throw away the rest

35:50.619 --> 35:51.949
This is my grandson

35:54.690 --> 35:55.949
Yes

35:56.589 --> 35:58.118
Yes I know

35:58.119 --> 35:59.219
real

36:00.159 --> 36:01.959
won't get into any more dangerous problems

36:01.960 --> 36:03.460
Be quiet, okay?

36:04.159 --> 36:07.068
Yes, I have a help request

36:07.069 --> 36:09.428
Well, what do you say?

36:09.429 --> 36:11.899
Soon Ae was suddenly discharged from the hospital

36:11.900 --> 36:13.969
He won't be treated well

36:14.310 --> 36:16.980
I hope he's in a safe place with his family

36:17.339 --> 36:18.580
Not in this village

36:18.610 --> 36:21.250
Even if it's not cold, I'm still worried

36:21.850 --> 36:24.949
I will look for a good hospital in Seoul

36:25.480 --> 36:27.149
So do our police

36:27.150 --> 36:28.619
- I'll send it there
- Okay

36:29.960 --> 36:31.319
and then

36:31.790 --> 36:34.330
Can I use this car for a period of time?

36:36.960 --> 36:38.060
Yun Yang

36:45.270 --> 36:46.710
are you waiting for me?

36:50.009 --> 36:51.509
what car is this?

36:53.049 --> 36:54.909
I'll answer questions as I go

36:55.350 --> 36:57.150
Anyway, it will take some time

36:58.549 --> 36:59.850
Why don't you go somewhere?

37:00.089 --> 37:01.250
a beautiful place

37:10.060 --> 37:11.060
superior

37:20.639 --> 37:23.480
How was the sea in 1987?

37:25.339 --> 37:27.880
It seems clearer

37:28.779 --> 37:30.080
Do you think?

37:31.279 --> 37:33.719
I'll come back later
to see how it goes

37:35.389 --> 37:37.389
There are many things to confirm

37:39.659 --> 37:43.159
So I wonder how it got to this point?

37:44.299 --> 37:45.799
think about it

37:46.869 --> 37:48.929
take you back in time

37:49.569 --> 37:53.310
I don’t think I’ve
seen any good scenes

37:55.739 --> 37:57.679
After getting the time shuttle car

37:58.009 --> 38:00.449
I think I have also been affected by the times

38:00.850 --> 38:02.309
Know the time in advance

38:02.310 --> 38:03.949
I want to change the future

38:04.049 --> 38:05.920
Because I have to run everywhere

38:07.250 --> 38:10.960
What I really want to do right now

38:11.860 --> 38:13.759
Who do you want to be, where do you want to be...

38:15.290 --> 38:17.259
I guess I've never thought about these things

38:19.199 --> 38:21.369
So think about it

38:22.900 --> 38:25.199
Do you want to go see the beautiful scenery with me?

38:27.739 --> 38:29.170
I think so

38:31.440 --> 38:34.080
- Come again
Come again

38:38.150 --> 38:41.088
in sweet, salty and salty foods that someone likes

38:41.089 --> 38:43.619
It's like he wants to see how delicious his food is

38:44.420 --> 38:45.420
again

38:46.759 --> 38:49.659
What do you like and what do you hate?

38:50.159 --> 38:54.230
I think I'm tired of hearing him say such trivial things.

38:58.270 --> 39:00.409
But I like all the answers

39:01.969 --> 39:04.440
Let's try each answer

39:05.509 --> 39:06.580
Excellent

39:20.830 --> 39:23.299
The best sweet and savory food is
topoki

39:25.130 --> 39:26.400
The next round is...

39:29.170 --> 39:30.339
used bookstore

39:30.839 --> 39:32.839
I also like the smell of old books

39:33.170 --> 39:34.209
faded yellow pages

39:34.210 --> 39:36.339
I also like the feeling of rolling

39:36.940 --> 39:38.879
With old books that are hard to find

39:38.880 --> 39:41.179
I also like the feeling of treasure hunting

39:42.980 --> 39:44.049
again

39:45.920 --> 39:47.389
Friday 3pm

39:47.489 --> 39:48.548
3 hours before leaving the office

39:48.549 --> 39:49.618
It's like owning the whole world

39:49.619 --> 39:50.889
Do you know this feeling?

39:51.290 --> 39:53.360
Because I was
the one who announced the news for the weekend

39:56.230 --> 39:58.259
Oh, who works on weekends?

39:59.529 --> 40:01.299
So what do you hate about Mondays?

40:02.299 --> 40:04.068
Sunday 9pm

40:04.069 --> 40:06.400
It was from then on that
I was no longer confident

40:07.170 --> 40:09.940
Just when I started announcing the news on TV

40:12.080 --> 40:13.350
I will love it from now on

40:21.219 --> 40:23.019
This looks like it should be a famous topoki shop in 1987

40:23.020 --> 40:25.159
The rice cakes are chewy and
delicious

40:27.630 --> 40:28.859
take a bite

40:28.860 --> 40:30.060
I also put it in the same game

40:30.230 --> 40:31.400
I will eat my feast

40:34.630 --> 40:36.569
Bus No. 540

40:38.000 --> 40:41.739
This is
where I sit at the bus stop when I'm depressed

40:42.569 --> 40:46.750
I got on the bus and
sat there without thinking about anything

40:47.980 --> 40:49.979
looking out the window

40:49.980 --> 40:52.779
I feel good after pulling the thread

40:53.690 --> 40:55.149
on the bus

40:55.150 --> 40:58.520
Route 540
has the best scenery

40:59.690 --> 41:01.989
i must remember

41:02.830 --> 41:03.860
and then...

41:06.799 --> 41:08.400
I stop here

41:09.730 --> 41:11.199
just because i tried

41:14.440 --> 41:15.710
Now really...

41:16.880 --> 41:19.080
I want to hear what you say to me

41:20.179 --> 41:22.150
Isn't that why you brought me here?

41:24.150 --> 41:26.380
The case is not over yet

41:26.580 --> 41:28.190
There's no way I was called here for no reason.

41:29.719 --> 41:32.619
Why did you get to this point and because of how difficult it was?

41:35.259 --> 41:36.960
no matter what i do

41:37.830 --> 41:39.529
You'll believe me, won't you?

41:41.130 --> 41:42.500
What's wrong?

41:44.400 --> 41:47.739
Although I can't tell you in detail what I plan to do now

41:48.710 --> 41:50.940
I can guarantee that nothing will happen

41:52.639 --> 41:55.279

Are you leaving now?

42:29.449 --> 42:30.520
Excellent

42:31.420 --> 42:32.449
Yes?

42:38.719 --> 42:39.790
Ho...

42:45.000 --> 42:48.929
Can you take me to the bus station?

42:50.540 --> 42:52.900
I'm a little scared because it's dark

42:57.279 --> 42:59.580
I shot the whole village for the news.

43:00.150 --> 43:01.750
This is what you reported

43:03.619 --> 43:06.319
I heard you
're providing information to reporters

43:06.819 --> 43:08.049
everyone is talking about it

43:09.089 --> 43:10.290
It's not just your case

43:11.259 --> 43:12.360
Are not you afraid?

43:13.060 --> 43:14.759
Because this is just my situation

43:16.860 --> 43:19.830
It means I live in the village where the murderer walked

43:20.529 --> 43:23.569
It feels like the people around me
are always in danger

43:24.969 --> 43:27.069
I
have too many people to protect

43:30.880 --> 43:32.080
good guy

43:34.210 --> 43:37.179
But your mother
doesn't think so

43:49.130 --> 43:51.460
Did I interfere again?

43:53.469 --> 43:55.500
Sorry, that's it...

43:56.130 --> 43:58.670
If my son
did something dangerous to protect someone

43:59.600 --> 44:01.069
I guess I'm worried

44:01.670 --> 44:04.179
It's like you
didn't ask what you think

44:06.880 --> 44:08.679
I know, I'm sorry

44:10.319 --> 44:13.080
It's like I
'm thinking a lot of these thoughts right now

45:07.610 --> 45:09.239
I collected every one for him

45:12.080 --> 45:14.150
There are also homemade ones

45:14.480 --> 45:16.049
Some of them are bought because they look good.

45:26.060 --> 45:27.460
Are these shoes really cute?

45:30.299 --> 45:31.929
How can it be so small?

45:32.429 --> 45:34.400
even in my days

45:37.040 --> 45:40.239
It's really weird to think that you're going to be walking on it

45:43.069 --> 45:44.480
Such a collection

45:45.610 --> 45:48.380

If you look at me with sparkling eyes

46:40.130 --> 46:41.569
how beautiful

46:46.969 --> 46:48.170
I've had this thought

46:50.639 --> 46:52.080
Why are you leaving?

Our news today is very special

The first case has appeared for five consecutive years

48:53.299 --> 48:55.230
It was chosen as a crime-free village

48:55.369 --> 48:58.238
It tells the story of a serial murder case that happened in a village
...

48:58.239 --> 48:59.400
- Hey
- Yeah

48:59.639 --> 49:02.609
Is this the news coming from our village
?

left its own symbol

49:41.679 --> 49:44.719
One of
the text messages was what he wanted to say.

49:44.880 --> 49:46.250
I put it in this matchbox

49:46.319 --> 49:48.289
Matchboxes
are mostly used by young people in the village

49:48.290 --> 49:49.819
Posted from teahouse

49:50.219 --> 49:51.989
Based on this information, the police

49:52.060 --> 49:54.129
The defendant had been in and out of ordinary residences

49:54.130 --> 49:56.730
Assuming it must be a young man from the same village

49:56.929 --> 50:00.028
Are there any suspects among consumers who may be the culprit?

50:00.029 --> 50:01.729
Although I made some inquiries

50:01.730 --> 50:03.670
No obvious results yet

50:03.900 --> 50:05.638
Because the defendant has not been arrested yet

50:05.639 --> 50:07.338
Although the whole village is worried

50:07.339 --> 50:09.408
It happened again

50:09.409 --> 50:11.710
Murder
survivor

50:11.909 --> 50:14.609
He was reportedly threatened again by the defendant

50:14.610 --> 50:16.549
The whole village is in panic

50:17.750 --> 50:19.719
when i see this handwriting

50:21.790 --> 50:26.520
If I didn't know better, I would feel like the defendant
was right next to me, watching me

50:26.960 --> 50:30.758
she is a terrible person

50:30.759 --> 50:31.859
that's what i said

50:31.860 --> 50:33.758
Are they really from our village?

50:33.759 --> 50:36.068
- Well - in order to restore the trust of the villagers in Wujingli...

50:36.069 --> 50:37.638
Aren't you here now?

50:37.639 --> 50:39.399
my mom says some disgusting things

50:39.400 --> 50:41.068
How quiet is this village
?

50:41.069 --> 50:43.669
- It's possible
- Yes

50:43.670 --> 50:46.508
- Don't say things like that
- No.

50:46.509 --> 50:49.349
Reporters
are currently investigating

50:49.350 --> 50:50.519
private visit

50:50.520 --> 50:52.920
I'll look at the witness statements

50:53.819 --> 50:56.548
Witnesses being interviewed now
, other than survivor witnesses

50:56.549 --> 50:57.819
as additional witness

50:58.060 --> 51:00.729
It may be important to arrest the accused

51:00.730 --> 51:02.489
He gave me important news

51:03.330 --> 51:07.100
I hope the audience will pay attention and listen.

51:09.029 --> 51:10.069
Well

51:13.569 --> 51:15.969
I teach Korean literature at Gojing High School

51:19.239 --> 51:20.610
This is Yoon Hyejun

51:21.850 --> 51:23.210
I came on the night of the 4th

51:23.380 --> 51:25.718
A third murder occurred in this abandoned house.

51:25.719 --> 51:27.119
He is also a witness

51:27.920 --> 51:29.420
At that time, he followed the defendant

51:30.350 --> 51:32.259
Then he ran to the mountains

51:45.770 --> 51:48.009
Has the teacher interviewed you?

51:50.339 --> 51:52.339
He told me he would bite me in the face

51:53.679 --> 51:56.179
Why does the teacher
show his face?

52:04.690 --> 52:06.619
as i see

52:06.819 --> 52:09.389
The defendant was wearing a black hat and
black jacket

52:09.659 --> 52:12.159
There is a vertical tear on the back.

52:12.460 --> 52:14.929
Is it because of the teacher’s face?

52:15.869 --> 52:19.099
That is, other people
have already got everything

52:19.100 --> 52:20.639
- Why teacher...
- That's what I said

52:21.469 --> 52:22.469
brother

52:25.174 --> 52:26.839
- Bro
- Okay

52:27.810 --> 52:30.210
What are you so focused on
?

52:30.880 --> 52:33.420
It's a bit like this...

52:35.020 --> 52:36.150
angry

52:36.319 --> 52:39.219
So in the end
, I don't know if there's anything else to say.

52:40.360 --> 52:42.259
During the pursuit of the defendant

52:42.560 --> 52:45.259
I saw the defendant's face with my own eyes

52:46.730 --> 52:48.630
If you confront the defendant again

52:49.929 --> 52:52.069
I think you can remember it

53:00.810 --> 53:02.649
Send it out to Oh Jae-ri, Gyeonggi-do as soon as possible

53:02.650 --> 53:03.679
Yes

53:33.610 --> 53:35.650
Both houses are now empty

53:36.009 --> 53:38.420
If you wait until tomorrow night
you'll get it

53:41.190 --> 53:43.190
Did he really show up?

53:43.949 --> 53:46.920
If he watches the news,
it will definitely appear

53:47.730 --> 53:50.130
It was hard to control the urge to see what he said he saw on his face

55:25.719 --> 55:26.860
What

55:34.369 --> 55:35.900
Why are you here?

55:45.839 --> 55:47.179
What was said in the news...

55:48.750 --> 55:50.409
He saw the defendant's face

55:51.719 --> 55:52.850
It's a lie, isn't it?

55:53.650 --> 55:54.689
what did he say?

55:54.690 --> 55:56.889
So what if the real culprit is found?

55:57.960 --> 55:59.920
Why do you do such a dangerous thing
...

56:04.330 --> 56:06.099
Let's leave here for now

56:06.100 --> 56:07.330
how do you know?

56:09.469 --> 56:10.699
this is a lie

56:12.540 --> 56:14.170
I can't see his face

56:15.270 --> 56:16.670
how do you know?

56:17.139 --> 56:18.610
How can you be so sure?

56:26.880 --> 56:27.949
if you find

56:30.219 --> 56:31.790
Because there is no reason to know

56:35.730 --> 56:36.790
Absolutely...

56:39.060 --> 56:41.469
There is no reason to say such a thing

56:49.469 --> 56:50.810
did you know?

56:52.310 --> 56:53.610
Who is the culprit?

57:09.659 --> 57:12.029
In that box of baby supplies

57:12.560 --> 57:13.929
This one also exists

57:15.199 --> 57:17.000
When will that child be born?

57:17.799 --> 57:19.500
cold winter wind

57:22.569 --> 57:24.710
I want to put warm clothes on for him

57:28.009 --> 57:29.650
I do it by myself

57:33.650 --> 57:34.650
acre...

57:37.589 --> 57:39.259
Do you know what this is?

57:51.839 --> 57:53.369
It's all my stuff

57:54.810 --> 57:57.170
The ropes that bind those people

57:58.080 --> 57:59.339
matchbox

58:01.350 --> 58:03.350
everything starts from me

58:09.989 --> 58:11.259
Our Xizhong

58:16.029 --> 58:18.500
I really want to meet this kid

58:21.130 --> 58:23.330
But now I don't know what to do

58:28.569 --> 58:29.739
he...

58:31.339 --> 58:32.880
That bad guy...

58:38.580 --> 58:39.679
that person...

58:45.159 --> 58:46.319
The child's father...

58:53.060 --> 58:54.330
Are you talking about the culprit?

58:58.239 --> 59:00.270
Is that why you left?

59:01.569 --> 59:02.710
I am afraid

59:05.909 --> 59:07.310
Because it's so disgusting

59:09.980 --> 59:12.449
Because I can't stay with people like this anymore

59:15.589 --> 59:17.690
I have been waiting for this child for a long time...

59:19.860 --> 59:21.259
I do not know right now

59:23.929 --> 59:25.730
Now I don't want to see it again

59:28.069 --> 59:29.170
Now...

59:31.799 --> 59:33.440
I don't want to see it again

59:35.670 --> 59:37.339
That man’s child is…

59:40.380 --> 59:41.909
Very disgusting

59:43.949 --> 59:45.020
I'm afraid

01:01:08.730 --> 01:01:10.029
Why did he...

01:01:11.339 --> 01:01:12.369
Why this...

01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:17.770
Hare

01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:22.750
Yunyunwu

01:03:16.730 --> 01:03:20.259
