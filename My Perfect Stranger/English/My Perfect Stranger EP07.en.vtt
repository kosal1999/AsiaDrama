"The Stranger I Met"
Episode 7

00:16.480 --> 00:19.049
(Wu Jindong)

00:28.799 --> 00:31.529
(Kyung Gi Joo)

00:40.810 --> 00:43.980
"A Stranger I Met"

00:45.310 --> 00:46.748
Did the blue hat show up?

00:46.749 --> 00:48.950
(past story)

00:55.920 --> 00:57.420
there are more people

00:57.630 --> 00:59.329
- Hersul
- Brothers

01:04.700 --> 01:06.369
That night he fled the bridge

01:06.370 --> 01:07.899
The blue hat is Bahisu

01:10.839 --> 01:11.839
Liu Fan believes

01:12.740 --> 01:14.509
The victim and I walked the same path.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.749
One of the three current suspects

01:20.750 --> 01:22.419
a hidden blue hat

01:23.280 --> 01:24.919
Everything matches the location

01:25.319 --> 01:27.419
The person closest to the current defendant

01:28.360 --> 01:29.690
your father

01:30.520 --> 01:31.530
Bais

01:31.990 --> 01:33.190
I'm talking about blue hat

01:34.959 --> 01:36.458
The person who might have killed my mother

01:36.459 --> 01:38.199
have you seen?

01:39.630 --> 01:41.199
I think I can investigate

01:51.080 --> 01:52.550
(Bangbang Teahouse)

01:59.649 --> 02:02.360
(Bangbang Teahouse)

02:13.829 --> 02:17.539
(Section 7 - Overlapping paths)

02:18.370 --> 02:20.009
Article (7)

02:34.519 --> 02:35.519
Yes

02:35.989 --> 02:38.130
I didn't even know it was wrong from the beginning

02:47.199 --> 02:49.539
1987 Three Suspects

02:52.539 --> 02:55.180
Produced by police who were unable to identify the arresting suspect

02:55.310 --> 02:58.149
Find the real culprit from the list of suspects

02:58.150 --> 02:59.979
( Suspect in Wu Jong-il serial murder case )

03:06.789 --> 03:08.359
that's wrong

03:15.699 --> 03:17.799
( Suspect in Wu Jong-il serial murder case )

03:21.769 --> 03:22.970
How are you?

03:27.139 --> 03:28.579
I said I can bear it

03:29.680 --> 03:30.680
Excellent

03:32.109 --> 03:33.849
Except these two

03:33.850 --> 03:35.380
this is not new

03:36.880 --> 03:38.190
Although I only found out five minutes ago

03:39.190 --> 03:40.350
Although Sprite happened

03:46.759 --> 03:49.728
Where did you find this photo?

03:49.729 --> 03:51.030
This is my first time seeing

03:52.500 --> 03:54.600
Looks like we need to investigate thoroughly

03:55.000 --> 03:57.299
Not very good at detective skills

04:00.970 --> 04:01.979
No

04:05.150 --> 04:06.380
It’s about Bayusu

04:06.880 --> 04:08.850
Among so many documents,
there is no one

04:10.180 --> 04:12.919
I don't think I'm a suspect

04:15.160 --> 04:16.590
What kind of person have you become?

04:17.220 --> 04:18.359
your great uncle

04:19.329 --> 04:20.359
Bayusu

04:24.830 --> 04:25.830
I have no idea

04:27.530 --> 04:29.640
Even though I thought I knew

04:32.539 --> 04:34.369
Until today I see you there

04:53.059 --> 04:55.400
(disco)

04:58.499 --> 05:00.299
Too far away to call family

05:01.770 --> 05:04.200
People who are too close cannot be called strangers

05:06.470 --> 05:07.470
but...

05:08.309 --> 05:10.479
That disappointingly familiar face

05:11.879 --> 05:13.410
there is almost nothing there

05:20.720 --> 05:22.520
What are you doing now, uncle?

05:24.320 --> 05:25.660
Book

05:25.890 --> 05:28.859
Didn't you tell me not to enter other people's rooms?

05:30.330 --> 05:32.700
Why are you doing this to me?

05:33.270 --> 05:35.270
- Almost let it go
- Haha

05:40.869 --> 05:42.340
- Nothing happened
- Oops

05:45.179 --> 05:50.879
(small door)

05:54.960 --> 05:56.059
Apologize

05:58.030 --> 05:59.489
excuse me

06:00.229 --> 06:01.530
Don't shout

06:03.460 --> 06:04.669
we are family

06:07.499 --> 06:08.869
my father's family

06:11.100 --> 06:14.140
Didn’t my mother and I have a place in it from the beginning
?

06:15.010 --> 06:16.379
Do you think you don’t know enough?

06:19.609 --> 06:22.780
That's why this isn't family to me,
Dad

06:36.229 --> 06:38.700
Hey Yoon Young

06:41.470 --> 06:42.470
hold on..

06:44.669 --> 06:45.710
I do not know

06:46.669 --> 06:48.979
Do I really know that person?

06:50.410 --> 06:52.049
What kind of nation has it become?

06:54.249 --> 06:55.249
(Badminton eight events)

06:55.250 --> 06:57.379
So you have to find out from here

07:24.080 --> 07:26.410
I was shocked

07:27.309 --> 07:28.320
- Bamboo
- Come on

07:35.189 --> 07:38.830
From now on,
I will ask three or four very simple questions

07:39.129 --> 07:40.890
If there is a lie in the answer

07:41.799 --> 07:43.298
There is a parent-teacher meeting tomorrow morning

07:43.299 --> 07:45.869
it's not fair

07:46.999 --> 07:48.470
Parent-teacher conference teacher...

07:48.570 --> 07:50.270
- Uncle totally
...

07:56.609 --> 07:57.679
Whose is that?

07:59.549 --> 08:00.580
Is this a hat?

08:04.020 --> 08:07.189
Not yet,
the Night King is coming for him

08:07.590 --> 08:08.859
Why do other people's hats...

08:09.890 --> 08:10.890
Will they do it tomorrow?

08:11.629 --> 08:13.959
I called my uncle at eight o'clock in the morning.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.129
Why my brother?

08:18.629 --> 08:21.470
I rented it for a while last night and watched it.

08:22.570 --> 08:23.600
last night..

08:24.809 --> 08:27.439
What is the real reason why he went to Wuzhen Inn Alley ?

08:27.869 --> 08:30.410
Wait, I already said that

08:30.780 --> 08:32.079
every time i go for a walk

08:32.080 --> 08:34.249
If I'm wrong
I'll ask more specifically

08:35.879 --> 08:36.950
last night..

08:37.720 --> 08:39.589
Until you change the direction of travel

08:39.590 --> 08:41.659
Who asked you to take that path?

08:44.389 --> 08:46.460
The person who walked together but
disappeared alone

08:47.999 --> 08:49.700
Just like walking out from in front of me

08:50.159 --> 08:52.300
There is no point in lying

08:53.970 --> 08:55.070
Who is that?

09:09.080 --> 09:12.050
Please do not turn on the lights on the second floor

09:12.350 --> 09:15.060
Just confirm

09:17.090 --> 09:18.090
WHO？

09:19.960 --> 09:21.930
Who asked you to do this?

09:33.440 --> 09:35.840
Who is your own mouth?

09:39.009 --> 09:40.050
mine..

09:42.749 --> 09:43.779
brother

10:09.680 --> 10:11.450
everything has been paid for

10:12.210 --> 10:14.179
Go to the second floor room where Lee Joo-young is alone at the match shop

10:14.180 --> 10:15.350
Do you want to know?

10:15.749 --> 10:17.618
Last night, Lee Joo Young didn't even show up at Bom Bom Play House

10:17.619 --> 10:18.919
forced to do this

10:18.920 --> 10:21.759
This means that Lee Joo Young was targeted from the beginning.

10:23.190 --> 10:24.290
Not that, but here

10:25.529 --> 10:27.129
The man ran away

10:28.259 --> 10:30.829
Below is Lee Joo Young

10:30.830 --> 10:32.899
Could it be that he was peeping and
escaping at the same time?

10:33.769 --> 10:36.369
owner of blue hat

10:37.369 --> 10:38.639
The culprit is Bayusu

10:42.879 --> 10:45.180
If you were in front of such power,
you would feel dizzy

10:50.279 --> 10:52.290
If Ba Yusup is the real culprit

10:53.249 --> 10:56.389
No need to wait,
see you tomorrow night

11:01.859 --> 11:02.999
second victim

11:05.330 --> 11:06.570
Because you have to kill

11:10.769 --> 11:12.739
Do you really have the confidence to face it yourself?

11:18.550 --> 11:20.979
I mean, there's no need to suppress this feeling.

11:21.779 --> 11:23.680
It must be tiring and painful

11:24.950 --> 11:26.220
Because after all, we are family

11:56.479 --> 11:59.050
I'm disgusted,
my heart is in chaos

12:02.259 --> 12:03.889
but before that

12:04.820 --> 12:06.129
The rest of my thoughts

12:07.790 --> 12:08.800
my mother

12:10.029 --> 12:11.200
And you..

12:12.570 --> 12:15.700
There is only one thing that must be protected from despicable people

12:17.200 --> 12:18.239
that's why

12:31.420 --> 12:33.350
Why not spread the word around the neighborhood?

12:33.619 --> 12:34.889
About me and my mother

12:55.710 --> 12:58.109
I'm just a little confused
.

12:58.409 --> 13:00.080
No one knows better than me

13:01.450 --> 13:03.420
Required Documents
Missing Information

13:03.879 --> 13:05.950
From now on I'll fill in everything you need

13:06.149 --> 13:07.220
from now on

13:08.960 --> 13:10.720
You never know what you'll find

13:12.029 --> 13:13.259
Do you really have faith?

13:16.330 --> 13:17.430
Yes

13:17.800 --> 13:20.070
(trash can)

13:22.340 --> 13:23.840
Who did what?

13:25.609 --> 13:27.639
If it were true I would know

13:34.409 --> 13:36.119
Won't run away at all

13:37.779 --> 13:39.519
because it can be protected

14:08.619 --> 14:09.619
Are you there yet?

14:12.290 --> 14:13.290
Yes

14:13.389 --> 14:15.090
Bring a change of clothes

14:22.930 --> 14:24.259
What to do now?

14:26.300 --> 14:27.300
i have to find out

14:28.170 --> 14:29.899
Start with who the second victim is.

14:31.499 --> 14:32.639
who is it?

14:49.590 --> 14:51.019
Hello

14:51.560 --> 14:53.489
Contestant No. 2

14:53.759 --> 14:55.060
Ms. Gyeonggi

14:55.629 --> 15:00.170
Li Jing'e

15:00.999 --> 15:02.899
please help

15:10.540 --> 15:11.639
impossible

15:17.879 --> 15:20.190
Have you really not noticed something?

15:21.350 --> 15:23.060
I found my absent aunt

15:24.019 --> 15:25.129
because of physical weakness

15:26.960 --> 15:29.229
I only know that he died young due to illness

15:34.470 --> 15:36.470
Is there anything else that hasn’t been said yet?

15:39.340 --> 15:40.710
Already displayed on the second floor

15:40.909 --> 15:42.009
this explains everything

15:46.779 --> 15:48.479
Do you have any plans this time?

15:49.580 --> 15:50.748
Rented the house opposite

15:50.749 --> 15:52.119
Do you think this is a coincidence?

15:54.149 --> 15:55.519
Everything starts from scratch...

16:18.509 --> 16:19.850
Judging from the results for the entire month

16:20.379 --> 16:23.119
Today will be the most difficult day

16:24.149 --> 16:27.889
Because the people we want to save are not ordinary people

16:42.170 --> 16:44.970
(University Entrance Examination)

17:12.730 --> 17:13.830
(10,000 won)

17:58.310 --> 18:01.149
Find Dad's Emergency Fund

18:03.080 --> 18:06.350
I should have
thought about it earlier

18:08.889 --> 18:12.359
Yes, you can get it if you save a little more

18:13.459 --> 18:15.260
Just a little more

18:15.730 --> 18:17.159
Just a little more

18:17.530 --> 18:18.800
Just a little more

18:19.000 --> 18:20.469
Just a little more

18:20.629 --> 18:23.699
Just a little more

18:40.649 --> 18:42.389
Nickname Wu Zongri is crazy

18:42.719 --> 18:44.820
The craziest crazy woman around

18:45.790 --> 18:47.589
Why are you doing what you are doing?

18:47.590 --> 18:50.530
It is impossible to understand with normal thinking

18:54.230 --> 18:56.070
that's why it's the front of the house

18:56.600 --> 18:58.040
Because I don't know what to do

19:11.179 --> 19:13.990
At that time, the police found
the route

19:14.250 --> 19:15.760
It's hard to believe

19:17.359 --> 19:18.889
Missed too much

19:20.790 --> 19:23.359
After what happened last night,
I am even more sure

19:26.369 --> 19:27.369
ah

19:30.570 --> 19:31.600
Mother

19:32.310 --> 19:35.409
Anyway, that's
where those guys ended up

19:35.939 --> 19:38.209
Bom Bom Ti House tonight at 9pm

19:39.709 --> 19:41.310
Same as Lee Joo Young

19:43.520 --> 19:46.889
I must have seen the defendant after I left there

19:52.159 --> 19:53.389
Today is different

19:55.330 --> 19:57.300
Because we will be behind him

20:01.399 --> 20:02.800
This time for sure

20:05.240 --> 20:06.770
I will definitely do this

20:14.879 --> 20:16.179
our school

20:17.520 --> 20:18.550
What

20:19.689 --> 20:20.719
fever..

20:21.689 --> 20:22.919
39 degrees

20:23.389 --> 20:26.929
Yeah, what should I do
because I'm the only guardian

20:31.500 --> 20:34.429
Of course, if something goes wrong at school now,
I have to go to the hospital as soon as possible

20:35.699 --> 20:38.399
Do you know that hospital at the intersection?

20:39.270 --> 20:41.009
You don’t have to worry about class at all

20:41.010 --> 20:42.609
Stay connected and take care of yourself

20:44.179 --> 20:45.449
Well, yes, yes

20:46.949 --> 20:48.080
Mother

20:49.679 --> 20:50.980
Not today

20:52.750 --> 20:54.189
You can get it if you go to the hospital

20:55.250 --> 20:57.189
Oh, I'm on my way

20:59.730 --> 21:02.600
So kids are better off?

21:02.760 --> 21:05.129
Yes, I can be discharged

21:05.300 --> 21:06.500
I was asked to stay one more day

21:07.070 --> 21:08.740
Great, great

21:09.169 --> 21:11.800
Take this opportunity to let the kids eat whatever they want.

21:13.070 --> 21:16.039
Let them see their father's face as they please

21:16.040 --> 21:18.750
- Mr. Chairman, why are you doing this?
- Take it.

21:22.379 --> 21:23.750
if i don't

21:24.580 --> 21:27.320
I didn’t dare to look at my son’s face for three or four days.

21:28.090 --> 21:29.419
curry

21:30.320 --> 21:32.290
It hangs you up so you can't walk

21:32.859 --> 21:34.159
Am I not?

21:35.800 --> 21:37.459
Didn't do it on purpose

21:39.369 --> 21:40.399
Excellent

21:42.399 --> 21:44.439
cherry flavor

21:46.270 --> 21:47.909
Has Yin Yu returned to Korea now?

21:48.240 --> 21:49.510
Well, the call came

21:52.010 --> 21:53.649
He will come back to see his father's face

21:55.619 --> 21:57.350
It's been three years

21:59.449 --> 22:02.459
When slime appears before your eyes,
think of it as gratitude

22:03.290 --> 22:05.859
They won't spend the rest of their lives in your arms like children.

22:06.189 --> 22:07.189
Yes

22:11.330 --> 22:12.499
Want to eat one?

22:12.500 --> 22:14.330
Oh yes, thank you

22:18.469 --> 22:19.770
Really?

22:19.969 --> 22:23.510
If I were a Korean wife,
I would buy a fur coat

22:25.340 --> 22:26.449
Mother

22:26.609 --> 22:28.409
Is this a child?

22:28.879 --> 22:30.580
Is a fur coat affordable for everyone?

22:30.980 --> 22:33.589
No compulsory purchase

22:33.590 --> 22:35.590
- I will buy
- Madam

22:36.490 --> 22:38.559
If only my mother were a Korean lady

22:38.560 --> 22:40.958
Don't cheat and
try to stop drinking

22:40.959 --> 22:43.559
Miss Korea

22:43.560 --> 22:46.000
- I was rude to my sister.
- It's okay.

22:46.429 --> 22:48.128
What about everything that happened to me?

22:48.129 --> 22:50.540
In other words, I definitely
have potential

22:50.639 --> 22:53.540
Talking about 500,000 won again
makes me sick

22:54.740 --> 22:58.480
It's not like you meet someone you don't know

23:00.609 --> 23:02.080
My mother said she didn't know

23:06.149 --> 23:09.219
But can you support me a little bit?

23:09.560 --> 23:10.760
Are you crazy?

23:11.719 --> 23:14.060
not a penny

23:17.300 --> 23:19.830
Can't we hire a math teacher?

23:25.909 --> 23:27.439
I can't catch up now

23:28.369 --> 23:30.379
Now the college entrance examination is approaching

23:35.280 --> 23:38.889
If you add a little more to my savings...

23:39.750 --> 23:40.790
It doesn't matter

23:42.219 --> 23:43.260
he is

23:44.389 --> 23:46.730
What should I do when I don't recognize this shadow?

24:04.740 --> 24:06.580
Sun E

24:07.250 --> 24:09.750
If I had extra money, I would definitely hire a teacher

24:10.119 --> 24:11.280
father is late

24:11.679 --> 24:13.619
Goodbye my daughter

24:19.389 --> 24:21.929
Of course I have to buy some mother and son books

24:29.040 --> 24:31.198
If that's not enough, say it again

24:31.199 --> 24:32.609
don't tell your sisters

24:33.869 --> 24:34.869
want to go

25:10.939 --> 25:13.080
Neither noticed nor missed

25:13.350 --> 25:14.709
I said I work in a hair salon

25:15.010 --> 25:16.819
So are you going to work?

25:16.820 --> 25:19.218
I lost my job without notice over something as simple as that.

25:19.219 --> 25:21.250
There is no record of what he did during this period

25:21.419 --> 25:22.490
You will know if you follow me in the future

25:24.320 --> 25:25.889
Quiet

25:26.260 --> 25:27.290
Do you have

25:34.899 --> 25:36.939
Hey Shan'e,
did you do this on purpose?

25:37.540 --> 25:38.540
What am I doing?

25:39.270 --> 25:42.938
Just because you think my dreams are interesting

25:42.939 --> 25:45.750
Interrupting and talking about you like this

25:46.149 --> 25:49.379
Don't spend your money where there is no such hope

25:49.750 --> 25:52.590
Use it on my smart girl,
don't you think?

25:53.290 --> 25:54.990
I'm sorry to bother you

25:55.149 --> 25:57.820
I really don’t know
because I didn’t listen to my sister

25:59.189 --> 26:00.230
Don't listen...

26:01.060 --> 26:03.259
Now I'm going to ignore
this ratio

26:03.260 --> 26:05.229
No,
that doesn't mean

26:05.230 --> 26:09.469
Hey,
you're good at it, remember?

26:10.639 --> 26:12.240
that clip

26:12.369 --> 26:14.139
that's what i'm worried about

26:14.669 --> 26:17.010
My dad only bought you one

26:17.709 --> 26:19.379
Why is the whole school Level 1?

26:20.609 --> 26:23.379
So I was loved

26:23.750 --> 26:25.719
Until then, you know what?

26:26.619 --> 26:30.090
Do you think my father
doesn’t accept you as a teacher because he really has no money?

26:30.459 --> 26:31.659
What's that word?

26:32.560 --> 26:33.590
you..

26:34.859 --> 26:37.260
My father had no intention of sending me to college

26:41.270 --> 26:43.439
How did my sister know?

26:43.840 --> 26:45.969
You're the only one who doesn't know

26:46.369 --> 26:49.209
What was the father's wish from the beginning?

26:49.810 --> 26:50.939
you and me

26:51.179 --> 26:54.279
Marry into a good family early

26:54.280 --> 26:56.549
I want not to get a drop of water on my hands

26:56.550 --> 26:59.188
After requesting ABO study

26:59.189 --> 27:01.389
I want to find a good job and stay

27:01.790 --> 27:03.090
these two wishes

27:03.459 --> 27:06.889
but you are not like that

27:07.859 --> 27:08.889
That's it

27:10.060 --> 27:11.300
Will my sister do the same?

27:12.500 --> 27:14.330
- What
- just like my father.

27:15.469 --> 27:16.899
I'm not like that

27:19.669 --> 27:21.810
You can write without taking classes

27:24.480 --> 27:26.480
If my sister needs to do this too

27:29.280 --> 27:30.449
use this or fill it out

27:35.020 --> 27:36.520
I never thought this was funny

27:41.889 --> 27:44.459
Are you reading this to be smart or what?

27:45.560 --> 27:47.699
I ignored it until the end

27:48.830 --> 27:50.800
(10,000 won)

27:51.969 --> 27:53.209
ha

27:55.010 --> 27:56.439
I am angry

28:43.060 --> 28:44.290
I can go alone

28:47.459 --> 28:48.490
It is not

28:48.859 --> 28:51.659
Now I wish my mom would follow this direction

29:04.780 --> 29:07.379
(pay phone)

29:14.590 --> 29:16.619
This is the first time I resent my grandfather

29:17.689 --> 29:19.230
This is my mother's lifelong wish

29:20.230 --> 29:21.659
In the end I failed to go to college

29:24.800 --> 29:27.129
This was not unusual at the time

29:27.969 --> 29:29.939
Caste pain
is not common

29:31.070 --> 29:32.709
It means I don’t know enough

29:33.439 --> 29:35.869
How will you feel about blocking your daughter's choice later?

29:50.060 --> 29:51.389
What is he doing?

29:53.359 --> 29:54.530
no matter what you do

29:55.859 --> 29:58.629
We just wait for the defendant to come out

29:59.530 --> 30:01.669
No more changes can be made

30:15.149 --> 30:16.320
kakao

30:17.320 --> 30:18.320
Hello

30:18.879 --> 30:20.149
How are you, beautiful?

30:20.590 --> 30:21.919
finally ready

30:28.030 --> 30:30.329
So what are they?

30:30.330 --> 30:31.330
What should happen?

30:31.331 --> 30:34.100
Friends who are preparing for the Miss Korea competition with you

30:35.070 --> 30:37.800
He will first conduct South Chora

30:38.369 --> 30:39.609
He is the greatest ancient

30:40.040 --> 30:41.868
Gyeongbuk Region
3rd place

30:41.869 --> 30:44.439
I gave 500,000
to make the second one

30:44.480 --> 30:46.709
Oh, sorry for the second time

30:47.080 --> 30:48.080
Now

30:49.980 --> 30:51.418
our handsome guy

30:51.419 --> 30:52.820
Where will Gyeonggi Province take it?

31:00.129 --> 31:01.129
second

31:05.560 --> 31:07.570
Second or first?

31:08.369 --> 31:10.070
Enter now

31:10.699 --> 31:11.740
hurry up

31:12.070 --> 31:13.168
let's go

31:13.169 --> 31:14.739
(Wanted for fraud)

31:14.740 --> 31:15.840
up

31:17.010 --> 31:18.679
What are you doing I do not have time.
hurry up

31:20.580 --> 31:22.550
What are you doing?

31:23.580 --> 31:26.250
As expected, today is the day I was deceived.

31:28.750 --> 31:29.859
Am I being scammed or something?

31:31.189 --> 31:32.589
about half a million

31:32.590 --> 31:34.389
They will make me Miss Korea

31:34.730 --> 31:36.329
- Come on
- From the day I first came here

31:36.330 --> 31:37.500
they improvise

31:37.859 --> 31:39.999
Even if you get money out of it

31:40.000 --> 31:42.199
Because I spent all my money on booze and cash

31:42.399 --> 31:44.439
No money to cheat

31:46.740 --> 31:49.070
That money is my mother's money

31:50.909 --> 31:52.010
I can not afford it

31:53.609 --> 31:55.749
Why can't you afford it?

31:55.750 --> 31:57.280
500,000 tuition fees?

31:58.649 --> 32:00.719
Did you grow up in a wealthy family or were you
an only child?

32:01.350 --> 32:03.059
I don't know because I don't live as a daughter

32:03.060 --> 32:04.490
That's why I can be so calm

32:05.689 --> 32:07.590
what are you talking about?

32:08.129 --> 32:10.859
If you give it back, this won't happen

32:10.959 --> 32:13.399
Mom, what happened suddenly?

32:13.669 --> 32:15.570
We must go to Seoul together as soon as possible

32:15.699 --> 32:17.968
No matter what happens

32:17.969 --> 32:21.408
There is a child in our family. He is stupid but
very smart.

32:21.409 --> 32:23.040
Because I worry about him sometimes

32:23.679 --> 32:26.148
Next year, he will be admitted

32:26.149 --> 32:28.448
I
will participate in the competition next year

32:28.449 --> 32:30.419
what are you saying?

32:31.050 --> 32:32.580
- Haha-
No way

32:36.859 --> 32:38.619
What are you doing hurry up

32:39.490 --> 32:41.730
- Ah
- this guy

32:42.189 --> 32:43.560
hehe

32:43.629 --> 32:44.699
strength

32:50.100 --> 32:51.800
really quiet

32:53.310 --> 32:54.409
hehe

32:56.810 --> 32:58.679
- Ha
- Wait a minute.

33:12.389 --> 33:14.730
- Call Kyung Yi first
- Yeah.. Daw Lay Ray

33:19.359 --> 33:20.729
- Mom
- Where have you been?

33:20.730 --> 33:21.968
Mom, try to let go

33:21.969 --> 33:23.299
The bastard who pays back the money

33:23.300 --> 33:25.938
Hey, this girl...

33:25.939 --> 33:26.969
hehe

33:30.080 --> 33:31.980
Mother

33:37.280 --> 33:38.580
- Ha
- Really

34:33.069 --> 34:34.839
- Sun Lane
- Hen

34:36.679 --> 34:37.810
how do you know?

34:39.440 --> 34:41.909
I don't ask because I think it would be difficult

34:42.210 --> 34:43.520
I really want to know

34:43.850 --> 34:45.449
How recently have you moved to school
?

34:50.520 --> 34:52.259
let's be
friends

34:52.719 --> 34:54.489
only when we feel comfortable with each other

34:54.860 --> 34:55.860
Yes or no

35:00.369 --> 35:01.600
you are right

35:04.069 --> 35:05.069
the person I like

35:06.670 --> 35:08.040
love at first sight..

35:13.210 --> 35:14.949
But you know the result

35:15.480 --> 35:17.380
Even when he opened up, he was rejected

35:19.020 --> 35:20.719
someone is hanging out

35:21.549 --> 35:23.089
He doesn't accept my feelings

35:25.190 --> 35:27.389
This guy is honest

35:30.000 --> 35:31.429
thanks for letting me know

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
What?

35:35.730 --> 35:36.969
Ah, why?

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
ha

35:40.839 --> 35:42.309
- Should I pay
for anything?

35:42.310 --> 35:43.709
- Do I have to pay?
- What?

35:43.710 --> 35:45.138
What will you give?

35:45.139 --> 35:46.779
Can I get you a sundae?

35:47.580 --> 35:48.650
What

35:50.880 --> 35:52.380
just kidding

36:06.429 --> 36:07.429
How are you?

36:08.029 --> 36:09.199
Are you still affected?

36:13.839 --> 36:16.480
Why now,
why start now?

36:17.080 --> 36:19.610
This is not a place to meet

36:25.750 --> 36:28.190
If you knew it was me who was chasing you that night

36:29.150 --> 36:31.560
Ba Yusup
is not in this situation, except...

36:32.790 --> 36:33.929
Because of me?

36:36.089 --> 36:37.460
Because of Li Jing'e?

36:39.230 --> 36:41.830
So this is
something that has or has not happened before

36:44.270 --> 36:45.699
Is this a new problem?

36:51.139 --> 36:53.449
We are fine,
how are you?

36:56.850 --> 36:57.880
Thanks

36:58.480 --> 36:59.949
I don't think it's easy to get into

37:00.190 --> 37:03.560
I thought I was passing by by accident and
I should do something to help.

37:05.360 --> 37:06.389
Don't you think so?

37:06.560 --> 37:07.560
Yes

37:11.130 --> 37:13.429
I did something big

37:13.830 --> 37:15.769
Everyone, wait here for a moment

37:15.770 --> 37:17.369
I just went to the police station to report

37:22.440 --> 37:24.779
How did this happen?

37:28.909 --> 37:32.119
Scammers also pass by here...

37:33.049 --> 37:34.350
catch them all

37:34.819 --> 37:36.759
There is also the possibility of human trafficking

37:37.060 --> 37:38.389
i will understand

37:39.360 --> 37:40.959
I think it's a detective

37:40.960 --> 37:42.290
- Let's go.
- Of course.

37:43.259 --> 37:44.499
- Not a detective?
- police?

37:44.500 --> 37:46.769
- Police
- Can you help us?

37:46.770 --> 37:49.270
- They took our money
- Yeah.

37:51.400 --> 37:52.969
- Can you take me home
?

37:53.170 --> 37:54.469
- Please
- No

37:54.569 --> 37:56.908
- Mom will kill me.
- Help me get home.

37:56.909 --> 37:58.178
- Please
help me

37:58.179 --> 38:00.750
- Mom will be angry
- What will they do?

38:01.179 --> 38:03.178
- Call my mom
- please

38:03.179 --> 38:04.980
- Mom
- I have to go home.

38:06.080 --> 38:09.619
- If you don't call, you'll die
- Ha

38:19.029 --> 38:21.029
Did they really
disappear together?

38:23.270 --> 38:24.369
Last night we...

38:25.400 --> 38:27.839
Remember how I told you
what to do if you had to?

38:28.639 --> 38:30.409
yes, I remember

38:31.980 --> 38:33.080
so be careful

38:39.350 --> 38:41.250
if it is true

38:41.989 --> 38:43.989
Although there is absolutely no such thing

38:45.389 --> 38:47.429
if anything changes

38:47.860 --> 38:49.429
if you miss the victim

38:51.860 --> 38:52.929
Well

38:57.299 --> 38:58.369
Yes

39:00.610 --> 39:01.670
How are you?

39:03.040 --> 39:05.339
Unusual,
stop immediately

39:09.150 --> 39:10.349
come over

39:10.350 --> 39:11.750
did you sleep well?

39:12.779 --> 39:14.089
As far as I know, no

39:14.250 --> 39:15.589
Does it matter?

39:24.330 --> 39:26.199
It is said that the most abundant
sad drama in the world is

39:27.299 --> 39:28.969
Why are you doing so much?

39:30.339 --> 39:33.469
Everyone is a stranger to you, right?

39:34.739 --> 39:37.880
If you can save everyone,
you can't survive

39:39.739 --> 39:41.909
Just find the culprit

39:43.380 --> 39:45.150
Easier and cheaper way

39:48.650 --> 39:50.389
I think no matter how many there are

39:59.299 --> 40:02.799
The ground is cold

40:04.869 --> 40:09.610
(3 months in 2022)

40:11.880 --> 40:14.279
When I first learned of my death and went looking for it

40:14.750 --> 40:16.850
All conditions are met

40:18.819 --> 40:19.920
three months

40:20.920 --> 40:23.319
The murder happened two months ago

40:26.159 --> 40:28.589
Because the destination that can be decided is only one year

40:28.759 --> 40:30.758
If you want to meet the defendant there

40:30.759 --> 40:32.230
There is nothing to do but wait

40:34.130 --> 40:35.969
Until he comes back a month later

40:36.170 --> 40:37.869
A whole ten months

40:54.790 --> 40:57.119
No matter what, people
die once in a while

40:57.860 --> 40:59.659
This is a very bad ending

41:10.040 --> 41:12.299
There at that time

41:12.940 --> 41:16.239
By chance he found a garbage man

41:17.139 --> 41:19.440
Because everything
ended in an instant

41:24.049 --> 41:25.580
(Bangbang Teahouse)

41:28.389 --> 41:30.060
The weather is cold

41:31.219 --> 41:32.819
lie down like abandoned

41:51.310 --> 41:53.310
But such a person

41:54.009 --> 41:56.719
After realizing there is more elsewhere

41:57.650 --> 41:59.449
Then I got scared

42:01.420 --> 42:03.150
Because I can't stop it because I know

42:08.429 --> 42:11.460
know means change

42:12.130 --> 42:13.199
That is..

42:14.130 --> 42:17.699
Because that's a pretty heavy expectation

42:32.150 --> 42:34.889
Responsible for where Bayusu can be found

42:40.029 --> 42:41.230
how about you?

42:46.159 --> 42:49.000
I
'll go where the murders actually happened

42:49.199 --> 42:51.099
(Mysterious murder case,
the body was found with its hands and neck tied)

42:51.100 --> 42:52.799
(Another female body was found,
a 20-year-old female was killed)

43:00.380 --> 43:03.009
(Sun and Moon Record Store)

43:05.549 --> 43:06.989
what does that mean?

43:08.319 --> 43:09.420
do you know?

43:14.860 --> 43:17.229
I just wish I hadn't found it

43:17.230 --> 43:18.698
(20-year-old college student
was found murdered)

43:18.699 --> 43:20.630
( The body of a school teacher was found on the bank of a river in a quiet village )

43:28.210 --> 43:29.239
That is..

43:31.779 --> 43:33.549
This must mean it's too late

43:41.319 --> 43:44.290
(Wuzhuang Grocery Store)

43:59.770 --> 44:01.310
Think it's too late?

44:05.679 --> 44:08.980
I haven't found any clues yet

44:10.650 --> 44:12.020
not enough

44:13.650 --> 44:15.719
So
where exactly are you doing?

44:16.350 --> 44:17.759
all roads and roads

44:24.100 --> 44:25.100
Yes

44:26.699 --> 44:28.469
I don't know if I'm doing something

44:29.770 --> 44:32.069
If nothing really happened

44:33.770 --> 44:35.810
Could it be doing something somewhere?

44:36.980 --> 44:39.439
But we
can get a good end result

44:39.440 --> 44:41.509
Don't you think I'm just looking for a place like this?

44:42.449 --> 44:45.449
Just enough place to kill someone

44:47.389 --> 44:49.690
If Bayusu and I are together, I'm sure...

44:57.900 --> 44:58.900
No

44:59.429 --> 45:01.029
If so, the field would be very broad

45:02.969 --> 45:04.170
what time is it now?

45:05.299 --> 45:06.639
9 hours and 10 minutes

45:08.569 --> 45:09.639
Ordinary shop

45:10.380 --> 45:12.239
This was the last location recorded by police

45:13.750 --> 45:15.310
things have changed

45:15.409 --> 45:17.520
- No reason to go there now..
- No reason not to go there.

45:19.150 --> 45:21.889
I know I'm afraid of change

45:23.219 --> 45:24.460
I have no idea

45:25.389 --> 45:28.360
No matter what you do, the result is the same.

45:29.389 --> 45:30.759
Such problems often exist

45:33.130 --> 45:34.568
- That's what time is
- That's what time is

45:34.569 --> 45:37.838
I don't even know this is time, this is love

45:37.839 --> 45:41.109
It's a feeling hidden like fog

45:41.110 --> 45:44.379
This is love that shines like the morning star

45:44.380 --> 45:46.008
Yesterday too

45:46.009 --> 45:47.649
- It was all yesterday
- It was all yesterday

45:47.650 --> 45:49.278
Today too

45:49.279 --> 45:50.948
- Today
- Today all

45:50.949 --> 45:52.948
Tomorrow too

45:52.949 --> 45:54.789
- I can't stand the entrance being closed
- all the time

45:54.790 --> 45:56.488
- That's what I want to hear
- Please sit down quickly

45:56.489 --> 45:59.359
- Let's sing I like you together
- I like you

45:59.360 --> 46:00.459
bamboo

46:00.460 --> 46:02.830
- I like you
- I like you

46:03.699 --> 46:05.929
- I like you
- I like you

46:06.830 --> 46:09.299
- you like me
- you like me

46:22.150 --> 46:25.278
I want to say this every day

46:25.279 --> 46:27.048
heart-warming moments

46:27.049 --> 46:29.718
If you don't understand, let's sit down

46:29.719 --> 46:31.718
This is the love we can share with each other

46:31.719 --> 46:35.190
You like me and
I like you too

46:46.400 --> 46:48.969
Is Gominsu also on the suspect list?

46:51.380 --> 46:54.250
He was imprisoned as a defendant for more than thirty years

46:55.210 --> 46:56.650
Although he ultimately refused

46:56.750 --> 46:57.980
Is that Ge Minsu?

46:59.150 --> 47:00.219
Why and how?

47:02.049 --> 47:03.960
Although there were three or four witnesses

47:04.619 --> 47:07.060
The main decision is the witness

47:08.060 --> 47:09.960
He said he witnessed the murder

47:11.299 --> 47:13.770
My sister, Wu Xu

47:16.969 --> 47:19.069
The Wuguang I know?

47:24.679 --> 47:26.980
One of the two
must be lying

47:27.850 --> 47:29.610
At least tonight is for sure

47:30.480 --> 47:31.980
Whose words are true?

47:32.049 --> 47:34.150
- Sing another song
- Okay

47:47.600 --> 47:49.000
they are breaking up

47:54.339 --> 47:57.710
( Suspect in Wu Jong-il serial murder case )

48:03.949 --> 48:05.549
I will go find my mother

48:07.350 --> 48:08.650
Now suddenly?

48:10.250 --> 48:12.159
Go on tell me who's lying

48:14.259 --> 48:15.330
Li Jing'e

48:16.290 --> 48:17.400
our little aunt

48:18.360 --> 48:19.460
I must

48:22.230 --> 48:23.399
Now we enter the second round

48:23.400 --> 48:24.869
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.499
GR8

48:26.500 --> 48:28.369
- always the best
- thank you

48:28.839 --> 48:30.270
Where are they going?

48:31.480 --> 48:33.139
(Bangbang Teahouse)

48:36.980 --> 48:38.250
This guy..

48:38.380 --> 48:40.179
let's go

48:41.250 --> 48:42.388
ah

48:42.389 --> 48:43.718
- I have to go
- I have to go

48:43.719 --> 48:45.388
- I'm leaving
- Tarta

48:45.389 --> 48:47.289
- Will you come back?
- See you tomorrow

48:47.290 --> 48:49.460
- Gone
- Tata

48:51.000 --> 48:52.029
strength

48:53.199 --> 48:56.469
(Bangbang Teahouse)

49:05.909 --> 49:08.049
How far do you want to go?

49:09.380 --> 49:10.880
Because I have something to say

49:18.860 --> 49:21.929
(hostel)

49:25.130 --> 49:26.830
Where did Li Zhuying go in the end?

49:32.869 --> 49:34.770
What did he do?

49:35.139 --> 49:37.409
(hotel entrance)

49:41.810 --> 49:43.009
(hotel entrance)

49:45.279 --> 49:46.350
What's your job?

49:46.520 --> 49:48.350
if you have something to say

49:48.589 --> 49:49.719
if they break up

49:50.860 --> 49:53.489
I know, I will do what you want

49:54.429 --> 49:55.989
So you want to surrender to me too

49:56.929 --> 49:58.060
Hey yubum

49:58.500 --> 50:00.028
I have to break up without doing anything.

50:00.029 --> 50:01.569
I'm too good to be immune

50:02.770 --> 50:04.739
In the meantime I give you
the time

50:06.540 --> 50:07.540
Yes or no

50:10.170 --> 50:11.179
release

50:11.279 --> 50:13.509
save me, save me

50:13.540 --> 50:14.810
hehe

50:20.750 --> 50:24.119
Let's go somewhere
and have another drink

50:25.060 --> 50:28.360
They said they wanted to sit at the same table

50:29.060 --> 50:30.460
What do your friends think of me?

50:30.860 --> 50:33.560
Because other friends just sit there for a while

50:34.369 --> 50:36.869
I don't deal with garbage like you

50:37.440 --> 50:38.540
He speaks beautifully

50:41.040 --> 50:42.969
If you don't want to hear more beautiful words, just leave

50:43.239 --> 50:45.110
Even if not, I'm still very angry today

50:47.779 --> 50:49.710
I want to take it easy today

51:05.400 --> 51:06.730
You shoot first

51:16.940 --> 51:18.040
Son, are you okay?

51:18.339 --> 51:20.339
Hey, boss, are you hurt somewhere?

51:22.279 --> 51:23.650
This guy

51:25.020 --> 51:26.350
you are no longer friends

51:32.520 --> 51:33.520
Let's go, sun

51:42.369 --> 51:43.429
try to die

51:53.339 --> 51:54.380
ha

51:54.850 --> 51:57.819
I think I'm dead, what should I do?

51:58.150 --> 51:59.319
How to do it?

52:02.089 --> 52:03.089
I have no idea

52:07.360 --> 52:08.360
hold on

52:14.270 --> 52:17.440
I think I have a broken bone

52:19.739 --> 52:22.309
(Li Jing'e, Li Zhouying)

52:22.310 --> 52:23.670
(Cause of death -
cranial nerve compression asphyxia)

52:27.549 --> 52:28.710
a bone is broken

52:29.310 --> 52:31.949
Currently I am unable to do any form of bundling

52:38.790 --> 52:41.259
please call my mom

52:42.130 --> 52:44.000
Mother

52:46.799 --> 52:48.230
Let's go, Li Jing'e

52:52.339 --> 52:54.409
Why did it really disappear?

52:54.639 --> 52:55.838
- Wait until the police come
- But

52:55.839 --> 52:56.868
Didn't you hear?

52:56.869 --> 52:59.380
Can it really be left like this?

52:59.580 --> 53:01.480
drinking

53:01.850 --> 53:03.809
If something like this happens...

53:03.810 --> 53:04.819
It doesn't matter

53:05.020 --> 53:06.650
Because I'm the only witness

53:07.619 --> 53:10.589
I just saw you tweet

53:12.719 --> 53:14.159
eyewitness?

53:14.489 --> 53:16.360
That's why I'm currently cautious

53:17.060 --> 53:19.429
He rarely drinks
and comes home early

53:20.230 --> 53:23.468
If he is caught, he
will have to pay a lot of money

53:23.469 --> 53:24.540
do you know?

53:24.670 --> 53:25.670
Yes

53:26.299 --> 53:28.009
I rarely drink

53:28.770 --> 53:30.610
if you go home early

53:31.839 --> 53:34.210
How can I see my parents' faces clearly?

53:34.710 --> 53:38.250
How can I look at my sister's face because I feel ashamed

53:38.449 --> 53:39.549
Well

53:39.819 --> 53:43.149
I'm 22 and
I'm sure there's nothing I can do

53:43.150 --> 53:44.589
disappointing

53:45.060 --> 53:47.759
Are you a liar now?

53:48.389 --> 53:51.959
I no longer have
the ability to live

53:51.960 --> 53:54.299
I'm exhausted

53:54.469 --> 53:56.299
I really can't stand it anymore

53:58.940 --> 54:00.400
Miss Korea...

54:01.110 --> 54:03.569
Not really yet

54:08.679 --> 54:10.750
But
according to what I observed at the same time

54:11.880 --> 54:14.819
Woo Jae Ri Geun Sun’s statement
is roughly correct

54:15.350 --> 54:18.520
It's not bad to always dance in the club

54:19.219 --> 54:21.630
It's also great at making friends laugh

54:22.130 --> 54:23.290
dress up

54:24.400 --> 54:25.400
I have an eye for fashion

54:26.460 --> 54:29.130
Not Miss Korea, but many people on TV

54:29.429 --> 54:31.838
If you know exactly what you want to do,
you're around 22 years old

54:31.839 --> 54:33.900
you can be young

54:35.210 --> 54:36.239
for real..

54:37.480 --> 54:39.339
Do you think so?

54:41.310 --> 54:44.619
this is not a lie

54:44.779 --> 54:47.048
How can someone who has been robbed of all their money
be defrauded again?

54:47.049 --> 54:48.819
that money

54:49.219 --> 54:53.360
This really doesn't allow this poor little boy
to pay his tuition.

54:53.719 --> 54:54.790
ha

54:54.989 --> 54:56.759
You didn't lie, did you?

54:58.560 --> 55:00.159
try to drink with everything

55:00.869 --> 55:01.869
gentlemen

55:03.270 --> 55:04.270
Rob

55:05.540 --> 55:06.639
Well

55:06.969 --> 55:09.610
I took it back when I took it back unknowingly before.

55:13.009 --> 55:14.080
my God

55:15.679 --> 55:17.380
Mother

55:18.449 --> 55:21.020
so so..

55:22.589 --> 55:24.719
Can I give it to grandma?

55:24.860 --> 55:25.860
What

55:25.960 --> 55:26.960
I can't go back

55:34.199 --> 55:35.699
Hey, Lee Seung Yi

55:36.000 --> 55:40.639
- Do you know what happened today because of this
- sister?

55:42.670 --> 55:45.480
- Sister
- Sorry, son E

55:46.279 --> 55:49.909
I'm sorry for what I just said

55:54.350 --> 55:57.020
- I'm sorry
- Sister

55:57.489 --> 55:59.190
i'm angry with you

56:12.040 --> 56:14.339
(Lee Hyoman)

56:28.819 --> 56:30.589
thank you for everything you did today

56:33.819 --> 56:35.429
Did not see the defendant

56:37.360 --> 56:39.258
I think I'm coming out of the fog a little now

56:39.259 --> 56:41.000
I don't know what went wrong again

56:43.069 --> 56:45.069
Now there's only one chance left

56:50.710 --> 56:52.639
But it's
clear

56:53.909 --> 56:56.009
I am very satisfied with the scenery today

57:33.580 --> 57:34.650
Hello

57:55.440 --> 57:56.440
Who are you?

58:06.679 --> 58:07.690
teacher

58:08.949 --> 58:10.020
i believe in euben

58:15.730 --> 58:16.860
died

58:30.639 --> 58:32.279
he is dead sir

58:50.489 --> 58:51.659
died

58:55.170 --> 58:56.830
it finally happened

59:53.020 --> 59:55.060
"A Stranger I Met"

59:55.429 --> 59:56.489
How did it happen?

59:57.190 --> 59:58.259
i have to explain

59:58.659 --> 01:00:00.699
What you see is what you do

01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:02.699
Explain everything from start to finish

01:00:03.069 --> 01:00:04.440
You didn't go out, did you?

01:00:04.799 --> 01:00:07.339
Time and place have changed, but
death remains the same

01:00:07.369 --> 01:00:08.969
I've never died in a place like this

01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:11.580
It all comes full circle and
this is where we end up

01:00:11.679 --> 01:00:13.810
This village is not human,
why do you want to come here to die?

01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:19.020
Why is it so stable?

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:21.190
Try to relax your face

01:00:22.790 --> 01:00:23.850
this is very obvious

01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:38.440
