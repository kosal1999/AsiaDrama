00:46.380 --> 00:48.219
What did I steal? What are you talking about?

00:48.279 --> 00:49.620
my novel

00:49.679 --> 00:52.289
Don't lie shamelessly in front of me

00:52.350 --> 00:53.450
I want to make the truth known to the world

00:55.160 --> 00:57.160
Why are you so annoying Soon Ae?

00:57.660 --> 00:58.289
Keep making trouble

00:58.359 --> 01:00.130
Be careful to end up like your sister Shun Ai

01:00.190 --> 01:02.730
What puzzles me most during this time

01:02.800 --> 01:03.999
That's the sentence

01:04.060 --> 01:05.929
"Women who read are dangerous"

01:05.999 --> 01:07.940
Li Zhuying does have a book at hand

01:07.999 --> 01:09.600
The reason why Li Jingai went to that abandoned house

01:09.669 --> 01:10.740
It’s to send Baek Yoo-seop away

01:10.800 --> 01:13.069
The only thing I need from Lee Joo Young

01:13.140 --> 01:14.240
It turns out to be a book

01:14.440 --> 01:17.009
The victims really have something in common

01:17.080 --> 01:18.209
That's the book in their hands

01:18.309 --> 01:20.350
Maybe this is a warning

01:20.809 --> 01:22.750
I once wanted a woman who likes to read books

01:22.819 --> 01:24.550
Why do they always look like that?

01:24.720 --> 01:26.390
As if I am such a unique existence

01:26.449 --> 01:27.789
It’s really unpleasant to look at

01:33.130 --> 01:34.130
What are you doing

01:38.869 --> 01:41.270
It seems like you won't be able to tie the rope for a while.

01:41.440 --> 01:43.899
Does that hand hurt?

01:49.140 --> 01:51.550
It's all because you always like to drink

01:53.080 --> 01:54.750
will never get better

01:56.479 --> 01:58.149
Cases that happened in the village

01:58.250 --> 02:00.089
I saw the murderer

02:01.089 --> 02:02.819
I saw him kill someone with my own eyes

02:07.259 --> 02:08.399
The murderer is my brother

02:36.060 --> 02:37.120
alright

02:38.729 --> 02:40.729
This is really good stuff, right?

02:40.859 --> 02:42.660
Oh, of course

02:43.229 --> 02:45.970
If I had taken good care of it, let alone a hundred years.

02:46.199 --> 02:48.269
It won't be a problem even if it lasts two hundred years.

02:48.340 --> 02:49.769
Well, that's how it should be

02:50.669 --> 02:53.009
I plan to give it to my grandson to wear in the future.

02:53.069 --> 02:55.039
"Grandson" Yanyu

02:56.039 --> 02:57.910
Has Yanyu already talked about his marriage partner?

02:58.609 --> 02:59.979
Could it be that I got on the bus first and paid for the ticket later?

03:00.049 --> 03:00.949
You really are too

03:01.280 --> 03:03.519
If you talk nonsense, something will happen.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.049
Otherwise

03:05.720 --> 03:06.819
that

03:07.250 --> 03:09.220
I had a dream not long ago

03:09.289 --> 03:11.759
I'm walking in a thick fog

03:12.160 --> 03:15.560
You know there is an old bridge in the back mountain, right?

03:16.060 --> 03:17.769
As a result, on the old bridge

03:17.829 --> 03:21.900
But suddenly a tiger that big appeared

03:22.169 --> 03:24.440
But it obediently let me hold it in my arms

03:24.509 --> 03:26.210
Isn't this a great dream?

03:27.109 --> 03:28.979
I just think this dream is related to my grandson

03:29.039 --> 03:30.139
I plan to buy it first and prepare it.

03:32.549 --> 03:34.049
Although I don’t know when it will be

03:34.280 --> 03:37.079
But you should have a very smart grandson

03:38.090 --> 03:40.120
I'm here to commemorate our first meeting

03:40.190 --> 03:41.190
Just bought this

03:43.120 --> 03:45.530
I really don’t know when he and I will meet in person.

03:46.030 --> 03:47.859
Really curious

04:16.090 --> 04:17.759
Wait, please wait.

04:18.729 --> 04:19.729
Wait a moment

04:21.760 --> 04:22.799
This is a misunderstanding

04:23.760 --> 04:25.830
Things are not what Detective Bai thought

04:26.030 --> 04:27.669
Get out of the way or you'll get hurt

04:28.270 --> 04:29.400
listen to me

04:31.340 --> 04:34.070
Didn't I explain it to you just now?

04:35.340 --> 04:37.879
Ask me to find your person

04:37.950 --> 04:40.379
How could you possibly kill someone? This is outrageous.

04:40.450 --> 04:41.650
I told you to get out of the way quickly

04:42.749 --> 04:43.850
Yunying, it's okay

04:46.049 --> 04:47.090
It's fine

04:52.689 --> 04:54.359
Please let me talk to her

04:56.129 --> 04:56.929
during my absence

04:56.999 --> 04:58.400
She has to live her own life

04:58.900 --> 04:59.869
she is my family

05:12.379 --> 05:13.549
You are limited to three minutes to finish

05:24.830 --> 05:25.859
Just trust me

05:26.359 --> 05:27.859
Of course, what's there to ask?

05:28.760 --> 05:30.229
when i arrived

05:31.330 --> 05:33.100
he has been killed

05:33.929 --> 05:35.600
Maybe to save your mother

05:37.070 --> 05:38.939
Just fight the prisoner alone.

05:42.640 --> 05:44.140
then what should i do

05:45.150 --> 05:46.309
What should I do

05:47.710 --> 05:50.179
I'll be back soon. Don't worry too much.

05:51.619 --> 05:53.249
You go and stay with your aunt first.

05:54.119 --> 05:55.820
Gotta keep her in a safe place as much as possible

05:56.320 --> 05:57.830
stay with other people

06:01.760 --> 06:02.900
besides

06:04.700 --> 06:06.830
can you drive

06:09.270 --> 06:11.910
Do you know how to drive?

06:16.010 --> 06:17.340
Why are you asking this?

06:20.109 --> 06:21.820
Won't you be back soon?

06:23.979 --> 06:26.020
Then why are you asking me this now?

06:28.619 --> 06:29.689
just in case

06:30.660 --> 06:31.890
if it were me

06:31.960 --> 06:33.830
Nothing will happen

06:38.330 --> 06:40.970
Didn't I tell you about the future I want?

06:44.200 --> 06:45.570
anyway

06:47.070 --> 06:48.840
I will wait for your return at our home

06:50.080 --> 06:51.080
i will be alone

06:52.309 --> 06:53.850
Still very scared

06:58.789 --> 07:00.090
So you have to come back quickly

07:01.619 --> 07:03.220
don't get hurt

07:06.030 --> 07:07.090
knew

07:10.960 --> 07:12.169
I will definitely do it

07:31.890 --> 07:34.220
Really, this guy is really shameless.

07:34.960 --> 07:37.619
Forget it, the evidence is conclusive anyway.

07:37.789 --> 07:39.960
No need to waste time waiting for him to confess

07:40.160 --> 07:41.600
Organize the information you currently have

07:41.660 --> 07:43.660
Send him there at dawn tomorrow morning

07:43.900 --> 07:44.830
- Yes Yes

07:44.900 --> 07:47.530
Oh my god, this trouble is finally over.

08:14.729 --> 08:17.160
Hey, what's going on?

08:17.600 --> 08:19.869
Damn it, I'm going crazy

08:19.929 --> 08:21.869
Didn’t you say that the prisoner has been arrested?

08:22.200 --> 08:24.669
Didn't you say that catching that guy would close the case?

08:24.809 --> 08:26.369
How could this happen again?

08:26.539 --> 08:28.340
Why is it my daughter again?

08:29.039 --> 08:29.780
If anything happens to her

08:29.840 --> 08:31.280
How are you going to say it responsibly?

08:31.479 --> 08:34.080
- Dad, stop talking. - It's true.

08:53.029 --> 08:54.629
It’s not enough to take away our Jing Ai’s life

08:55.670 --> 08:56.940
If that guy is caught by me

08:57.570 --> 08:59.639
I will definitely cut him into pieces

09:06.249 --> 09:08.580
What should I do with my baby girl?

09:08.779 --> 09:09.850
Oh my god

09:11.350 --> 09:12.889
Soon Ae

09:58.899 --> 09:59.700
We are in the body of classmate Li Shunai

09:59.769 --> 10:01.470
Find the matchbox at Fengfeng Tea House

10:01.739 --> 10:03.200
There is also a note inside

10:03.670 --> 10:06.139
Not only did he write "Women who read are dangerous"

10:06.210 --> 10:08.509
Even the handwriting is the same, I'm sure

10:08.710 --> 10:11.009
This is exactly the same as what was written on the note before

10:14.550 --> 10:17.680
Gao Meishu is not a prisoner but a witness

10:19.050 --> 10:20.389
The prisoner is male

10:20.989 --> 10:23.060
The only person who knows what the prisoner looks like

10:24.359 --> 10:25.489
That's Go Mi-sook

10:31.769 --> 10:34.840
I think the guy in the abandoned house is the real murderer

10:35.399 --> 10:36.440
good

10:37.200 --> 10:39.239
As soon as classmate Li Shunai woke up,

10:39.310 --> 10:40.739
Just contact me right away

10:41.580 --> 10:42.580
good

10:49.720 --> 10:50.779
Yoon Haejun

10:54.249 --> 10:56.659
From the evening of the 16th to the early morning of the 17th

10:58.560 --> 10:59.690
That is to say

11:00.560 --> 11:02.029
Li Zhuying

11:02.100 --> 11:04.300
The time when Li Jingai was killed

11:05.899 --> 11:07.670
Where are you and what are you doing?

11:08.369 --> 11:09.369
you

11:15.239 --> 11:16.279
Is there a problem

11:17.979 --> 11:19.279
who is the prisoner

11:21.720 --> 11:23.019
Who is the prisoner?

11:23.080 --> 11:24.619
Why did you come to ask me this question?

11:26.590 --> 11:28.190
Another person was killed

11:29.720 --> 11:31.460
This time it's a male student

11:32.129 --> 11:33.960
Same school and grade as you

11:34.029 --> 11:35.800
A good boy died in an abandoned house

11:35.859 --> 11:36.629
Why

11:37.600 --> 11:39.729
Because if he hadn’t died, it would have been Lee Soon Ae

11:43.540 --> 11:44.700
What are you talking about

11:44.970 --> 11:47.970
Shun Ai almost died at the hands of the real murderer

11:49.239 --> 11:50.710
He died to save Soon Ae

11:50.779 --> 11:52.180
He died because of you

11:52.249 --> 11:54.080
How could it be because of me?

12:02.790 --> 12:05.190
If only you had called the police from the beginning

12:06.060 --> 12:07.389
If you hadn't lied

12:07.460 --> 12:09.300
Just frame someone

12:09.359 --> 12:10.800
If you make everyone's work in vain

12:12.100 --> 12:14.129
That won't happen today

12:18.609 --> 12:21.739
Although I don’t know who you listened to and what

12:23.540 --> 12:25.210
but i don't know anything

12:31.019 --> 12:33.090
Stop talking nonsense and tell me quickly.

12:35.119 --> 12:37.060
Who is the prisoner?

12:37.119 --> 12:39.859
Why are you telling me what to do?

12:39.930 --> 12:40.529
who are you

12:40.590 --> 12:43.859
He always appears in front of me and gets in my way

12:48.239 --> 12:50.200
Anyway, your plan

12:51.869 --> 12:53.340
It's finished, Go Mi-sook

12:56.379 --> 12:58.210
The Chinese teacher was arrested

13:01.009 --> 13:02.050
What did you say

13:02.619 --> 13:05.720
He might have to take all the blame

13:10.320 --> 13:11.659
what do you mean

13:12.460 --> 13:14.159
Everything is screwed up

13:14.759 --> 13:18.129
How could it be possible that Gao Minxiu, who was arrested by the police, committed murder?

13:19.629 --> 13:22.499
The police need a new prisoner anyway

13:22.570 --> 13:24.070
It turns out that person happened to be

13:35.420 --> 13:37.249
I know the reason why you did this Gao Meishu

13:38.420 --> 13:39.790
But it's wrong to do this

13:40.420 --> 13:42.790
Too many people are in danger

13:44.060 --> 13:46.259
If you need another way I will help you

13:47.930 --> 13:49.830
So please help me be beautiful once

13:50.129 --> 13:51.869
As long as you are willing to tell me who the prisoner is

13:52.070 --> 13:53.170
let me go

13:54.629 --> 13:56.570
I don't need your help

13:57.940 --> 13:59.840
I know nothing. You can leave.

14:08.479 --> 14:09.950
I already know that you appeared in Li Jingai's

14:10.019 --> 14:11.080
Crime scene

14:11.619 --> 14:13.050
I'm asking about your previous whereabouts

14:13.619 --> 14:15.320
Where were you and what were you doing at that time?

14:17.489 --> 14:20.430
I was also with Liu Fanlong at that time

14:23.560 --> 14:27.330
Because he called me

14:28.300 --> 14:29.470
At that time too

14:29.639 --> 14:31.300
She is dead teacher

14:31.940 --> 14:33.239
she is dead

14:33.810 --> 14:35.580
It finally became like this

14:46.489 --> 14:48.420
You were looking at Lee Joo Young's body

14:48.489 --> 14:51.190
He was very scared when he came to me

14:52.759 --> 14:54.690
Don't dare tell the police

14:54.960 --> 14:56.499
Isn't she a communist?

14:57.460 --> 14:58.330
That way everyone will know

14:58.399 --> 15:00.899
I saw her but didn't report it

15:01.269 --> 15:02.700
The reason why he is so scared

15:02.769 --> 15:04.899
Get involved with teacher Li Zhuying

15:05.840 --> 15:07.609
I think you should also know the reason very well

15:07.739 --> 15:09.180
After all, your nephew is his classmate

15:12.649 --> 15:14.249
if you now

15:15.479 --> 15:17.450
I plan to blame all this on Liu Fanlong

15:17.519 --> 15:18.389
You're asking for my alibi.

15:18.450 --> 15:20.389
I just answered honestly

15:21.889 --> 15:24.460
Liu Fanlong is not a prisoner

15:25.060 --> 15:26.690
You can tell just by looking at the handwriting

15:26.859 --> 15:28.729
And the same applies to my case

15:30.300 --> 15:32.430
You will know better when you go to school

15:33.170 --> 15:35.269
Exam papers and homework during this period

15:35.340 --> 15:38.070
You can’t deceive people by writing so many things.

15:47.649 --> 15:48.920
So what is this

15:49.850 --> 15:52.090
I found this in your pocket

15:55.489 --> 15:56.619
That's what I picked up

15:56.889 --> 15:58.889
Are you kidding me now?

16:00.889 --> 16:03.930
I know it's all mixed up now

16:04.729 --> 16:06.670
But there are many ways to confirm

16:07.369 --> 16:08.570
my handwriting

16:09.800 --> 16:11.340
And classmate Li Shunai

16:13.239 --> 16:14.609
You can wait until she wakes up and listen to what she has to say

16:15.310 --> 16:17.040
See who she is trying to escape from

16:17.639 --> 16:20.249
And why did Liu Fanlong have to die there?

16:22.249 --> 16:24.519
I'm also extremely curious

16:30.859 --> 16:32.529
Every time I meet you during this time

16:34.560 --> 16:36.830
Everyone thinks you are suspicious

16:44.340 --> 16:46.710
So I plan to take this opportunity to find out

16:46.970 --> 16:49.180
Why do I find you at the scene every time something happens?

16:50.109 --> 16:51.310
You can look forward to it

16:51.710 --> 16:53.779
Because you won’t be able to escape the law this time

17:51.240 --> 17:53.810
This may sound outrageous

17:54.609 --> 17:55.609
But I think you

17:55.679 --> 17:59.250
Like someone who came here intentionally to save me

17:59.980 --> 18:00.909
Really thank you very much

18:00.980 --> 18:05.080
The money was originally intended to be left to Shun Ai for tuition.

18:11.990 --> 18:13.330
Soon Ae is the teacher

18:13.629 --> 18:14.889
teacher

18:15.500 --> 18:17.030
The prisoner is catching up

18:17.800 --> 18:20.030
Wake up, Fan Long

18:23.669 --> 18:25.139
anyway

18:26.010 --> 18:27.770
I will wait for your return at our home

18:27.840 --> 18:29.179
So you have to come back quickly

18:30.580 --> 18:32.480
don't get hurt

18:32.609 --> 18:33.949
I will definitely do it

20:30.129 --> 20:31.129
But who is he?

20:31.199 --> 20:33.629
Why have you been crying since last night?

20:34.369 --> 20:36.540
He's the one who went up to our rooftop

20:37.040 --> 20:38.100
What did you say

20:38.500 --> 20:39.840
Then that brat

20:40.570 --> 20:43.409
Oh, please let him go

20:44.439 --> 20:46.679
He worked so hard because of us

20:47.080 --> 20:50.350
Even though he did nothing wrong, he was still arrested by the police.

20:51.649 --> 20:53.850
For the sake of Shun Ai

20:54.219 --> 20:56.219
He closed his mouth tightly and said nothing.

20:57.419 --> 20:59.590
It looks like he hasn't eaten all day

20:59.689 --> 21:01.530
Why is he hungry?

21:06.100 --> 21:08.699
Why are you hungry for Shun Ai?

21:11.540 --> 21:13.340
The doctor said Soon Ae was just too shocked

21:13.409 --> 21:14.810
There's nothing wrong with it

21:14.869 --> 21:17.439
She'll wake up soon

21:17.679 --> 21:18.750
Eat quickly

21:33.030 --> 21:34.129
Really

21:35.290 --> 21:36.629
I feel like I can't eat it

21:37.600 --> 21:39.600
Soon Ae is still lying in the hospital bed

21:40.699 --> 21:42.340
How scared do you feel?

21:44.040 --> 21:45.740
How cruel

21:46.770 --> 21:48.040
This will keep her from waking up

21:50.340 --> 21:51.639
That bastard

21:53.409 --> 21:54.780
catch the culprit

21:55.649 --> 21:57.080
I will never spare that guy

21:57.149 --> 21:58.580
Then you need to eat more

21:59.350 --> 22:00.990
How can a man be so thin and frail?

22:02.959 --> 22:03.990
hurry up

22:04.659 --> 22:05.689
Open your mouth

22:06.359 --> 22:07.389
Open your mouth quickly

22:09.359 --> 22:10.459
Hurry up and eat it like this

22:13.730 --> 22:14.770
Eat

22:15.100 --> 22:16.300
Hurry up and pick up the chopsticks

22:54.070 --> 22:55.109
Come out

23:31.709 --> 23:32.709
Tell me

23:33.409 --> 23:34.580
what happened

23:35.350 --> 23:37.550
Your ID card, resume, teacher qualification certificate

23:38.780 --> 23:39.949
It's all fake

23:40.820 --> 23:42.189
What exactly is going on

23:42.760 --> 23:43.760
just in case

23:43.820 --> 23:44.959
Include previous workplaces and residential addresses

23:45.020 --> 23:46.659
I've checked all the information you left.

23:46.730 --> 23:50.530
But there is no evidence to prove your existence

23:53.469 --> 23:56.570
Not only that, you weren't even born

23:57.340 --> 23:59.310
Do you know what this means?

23:59.939 --> 24:02.240
Do you know this is a more dangerous situation than killing someone?

24:09.850 --> 24:11.580
Answer truthfully when I give you the chance.

24:12.619 --> 24:13.750
I'm trying to bear with you and Bai Yunying

24:14.419 --> 24:17.219
The urge to arrest them together as spies

24:18.990 --> 24:20.830
I want to have a good chat with you

24:23.659 --> 24:24.899
Just because of the favor I owe you

24:25.560 --> 24:27.629
Uncle, you are wrong

24:29.899 --> 24:33.540
Because you never came to see me while I was in the hospital

24:34.040 --> 24:35.369
so you may not know

24:36.010 --> 24:38.949
If it weren’t for that teacher, my brother and I would

24:40.879 --> 24:42.320
don't know what will happen

24:43.350 --> 24:46.990
He comes to our ward every day and pats our shoulders

24:50.889 --> 24:52.060
He is like our guardian

24:52.490 --> 24:54.090
The only one for our brothers

24:55.260 --> 24:56.300
guardian

24:57.199 --> 24:59.000
Why don't you stand up for my stupid uncle?

25:00.429 --> 25:01.530
to take care of my poor nephews

25:02.969 --> 25:04.969
It's this favor

25:05.369 --> 25:06.669
make me put these ridiculous things

25:06.740 --> 25:09.010
And your suspicious behavior that no need to be asked anymore

25:09.080 --> 25:10.679
Brought to you

25:12.949 --> 25:13.980
so hurry up

25:16.520 --> 25:20.090
Can you give me an explanation that I can accept?

25:21.790 --> 25:22.790
if i said

25:24.520 --> 25:25.689
would you believe it

25:31.929 --> 25:33.000
if i put everything

25:34.300 --> 25:35.770
All confess truthfully

25:36.869 --> 25:38.139
Will you believe me

25:39.439 --> 25:40.469
What

25:41.139 --> 25:42.270
I have something to show you

25:44.040 --> 25:45.080
besides

25:45.679 --> 25:48.350
Although I never thought that you would owe me a favor

25:48.609 --> 25:51.020
But if you really think so, just this once

25:52.590 --> 25:53.820
can you do me one last favor

25:55.619 --> 25:56.889
Chairman Yin Bingqiu

25:58.060 --> 26:00.230
Help me bring him to my house

26:00.790 --> 26:01.790
It's now

26:03.500 --> 26:05.399
what is happening

26:07.070 --> 26:08.669
This is it

26:08.730 --> 26:09.800
Oops

26:22.679 --> 26:25.149
- Come over here, please. - Okay.

26:25.350 --> 26:26.590
- Let's go. - Come up.

26:56.350 --> 26:57.850
what are these

27:04.619 --> 27:05.590
How could this happen?

27:07.929 --> 27:10.260
Why is news from 1988 here?

27:25.409 --> 27:27.149
Why are the notes I wrote here?

27:31.350 --> 27:32.919
I think you'll have to see it with your own eyes to believe it.

27:38.119 --> 27:39.159
that is

27:42.189 --> 27:43.899
The fact that I'm from the future

27:49.199 --> 27:51.240
Although I came from a very far away time

27:52.399 --> 27:54.209
But the relationship between us is not that far away

27:55.879 --> 27:57.980
my dad's dad

27:58.439 --> 28:00.409
That’s Chairman Yoon Byeong-qiu

28:02.280 --> 28:05.149
Your nephew Baek Hee-seop's future daughter

28:06.020 --> 28:08.290
It’s Baek Yunying who lives with me

28:09.590 --> 28:11.260
You must have seen it many times

28:20.429 --> 28:23.540
In other words, you are in a time machine

28:23.600 --> 28:25.240
Did you come here?

28:26.469 --> 28:27.510
Yes

28:28.510 --> 28:30.040
That is to say, these cases that happened here

28:30.939 --> 28:32.340
Because we caught the wrong culprit

28:33.310 --> 28:35.550
So it will lead to your death

28:36.520 --> 28:39.350
So you came here to catch the real culprit yourself

28:41.619 --> 28:42.619
do you mean this

28:43.959 --> 28:44.959
Yes

28:49.830 --> 28:52.159
Sorry, Chairman, let's go

28:52.770 --> 28:54.500
It's all my fault for believing this lunatic's words

28:54.570 --> 28:56.899
Having you here so late listening to this nonsense

28:57.869 --> 28:59.840
It's not you who should get up

28:59.909 --> 29:01.340
Get up you bastard

29:01.570 --> 29:03.840
Even a bastard like you, the Intelligence Bureau,

29:03.909 --> 29:05.340
Or a mental hospital?

29:05.510 --> 29:07.609
No matter where you are, I will definitely send you there

29:07.679 --> 29:09.679
that thing

29:11.550 --> 29:13.590
Can you give me a look?

29:42.949 --> 29:45.580
So

29:48.350 --> 29:49.590
you really are

29:50.919 --> 29:52.490
My grandson?

29:55.429 --> 29:56.429
Yes

29:58.000 --> 30:00.100
dongzhi

30:02.270 --> 30:03.570
Chairman, what's wrong with you?

30:03.639 --> 30:06.340
Do you really want to believe that fantasy?

30:07.709 --> 30:08.939
that

30:10.040 --> 30:12.310
I know this sounds ridiculous

30:13.510 --> 30:16.219
But I bought that watch in a jewelry store yesterday

30:16.879 --> 30:19.949
He said that he finally got a piece from abroad.

30:20.090 --> 30:22.889
I spent a lot of money to buy it for my grandson.

30:23.090 --> 30:24.659
And the words engraved on it were written by me.

30:25.560 --> 30:27.659
And the engraving on the back is exactly the same.

30:28.689 --> 30:31.830
Can I even admit my handwriting is wrong?

30:35.300 --> 30:36.469
where is that watch

30:37.199 --> 30:39.310
Could it be stolen by him?

30:41.639 --> 30:43.409
I received it this morning

30:43.810 --> 30:46.409
But you arrested him last night

30:49.520 --> 30:51.580
I'm confused now too

30:53.590 --> 30:54.919
When he said he was my grandson

30:57.459 --> 30:58.659
The weird thing is

30:59.730 --> 31:02.389
This makes me feel pity for the beauty

31:12.939 --> 31:13.939
wrong

31:14.740 --> 31:15.909
Impossible chairman

31:16.740 --> 31:18.040
this is absolutely ridiculous

31:18.810 --> 31:22.480
That guy should be locked up again immediately.

31:48.209 --> 31:49.270
Soon Ae

31:51.510 --> 31:52.609
Soon Ae

31:55.080 --> 31:56.580
do you recognize me

31:57.580 --> 32:00.689
I am Yunying Soon Ae

32:10.060 --> 32:11.330
Soon Ae

32:11.560 --> 32:14.300
Thank you

32:15.500 --> 32:16.639
Yunying

32:19.100 --> 32:21.469
Oh Soon Ae

32:21.840 --> 32:23.480
- Ouch- Mom

32:25.379 --> 32:26.580
Refreshed yet?

32:26.679 --> 32:28.149
sorry

32:28.209 --> 32:29.980
Why are you apologizing?

32:30.080 --> 32:32.719
It's okay, just wake up

32:32.990 --> 32:34.149
never mind

32:35.850 --> 32:39.590
It's okay Oops

32:58.240 --> 32:59.379
Soon Ae

33:01.379 --> 33:04.179
Have you seen the prisoner's face?

33:15.060 --> 33:16.129
No

33:17.159 --> 33:20.070
Does the prisoner live across from your house?

33:20.629 --> 33:21.899
Teacher Yin Haijun

33:25.540 --> 33:27.510
what do you mean

33:29.139 --> 33:31.439
How could the teacher be a criminal?

33:32.379 --> 33:34.350
That's outrageous

33:36.520 --> 33:37.619
no

34:28.529 --> 34:30.670
Thank you for coming back safe and sound

34:41.909 --> 34:43.080
sorry

34:44.619 --> 34:45.949
I'm sorry for you

35:07.969 --> 35:09.509
right now we

35:10.339 --> 35:12.679
Do they look like relatives?

35:15.350 --> 35:18.380
It may not look like it

35:23.659 --> 35:24.860
but it doesn't matter

35:26.060 --> 35:28.029
Anyway, I've already said it all

35:33.199 --> 35:36.299
But did you come because you knew I was at home?

35:37.170 --> 35:38.270
correct

35:39.400 --> 35:41.009
Soon Ae woke up

35:43.509 --> 35:46.350
She told the police

35:46.810 --> 35:48.480
What happened that day

35:51.380 --> 35:53.150
and who saved her

35:54.790 --> 35:56.219
Teacher him

35:57.560 --> 36:00.230
Came to help me

36:02.259 --> 36:03.429
Let's go

36:05.029 --> 36:06.130
Really

36:07.230 --> 36:09.639
Yes, I understand

36:10.969 --> 36:12.339
What

36:16.069 --> 36:17.110
No

36:18.580 --> 36:20.509
There's nothing suspicious about him

36:21.080 --> 36:23.719
It is good

36:26.389 --> 36:27.719
Thank you Dongzhi

36:28.650 --> 36:30.119
I don't believe what he said

36:30.319 --> 36:31.319
It's because you always ask me for help

36:31.389 --> 36:32.420
will let him go temporarily

36:33.060 --> 36:35.389
But this is not enough

36:35.460 --> 36:36.830
More conclusive evidence is needed

36:40.369 --> 36:41.630
have you seen it on tv

36:41.699 --> 36:43.799
That kind of show about finding lost relatives, right?

36:44.069 --> 36:46.839
I heard that I occasionally try to do this

36:47.170 --> 36:48.339
It hurts

36:48.969 --> 36:50.509
It's just a blood draw, nothing more

36:50.839 --> 36:52.710
Don't know what the result will be

36:53.150 --> 36:54.710
You can't help but know

36:55.509 --> 36:56.150
If the result is wrong

36:56.210 --> 36:59.420
I'll send you to the intelligence agency or a mental hospital

37:00.150 --> 37:01.619
I see

37:02.920 --> 37:04.089
I let you go because I believed in the chairman.

37:04.159 --> 37:05.659
It's not that I believe you

37:05.719 --> 37:08.460
I don't believe any of your nonsense

37:08.830 --> 37:11.159
So I'll keep an eye on you until the results come out.

37:11.230 --> 37:14.330
Don't do anything stupid. Just stay at home.

37:14.469 --> 37:15.630
Not allowed to go to school either

37:15.830 --> 37:18.540
I will check at any time, you know?

37:25.440 --> 37:26.480
that

37:28.350 --> 37:30.920
Forget it, not that one

37:32.580 --> 37:35.850
Who did our Hee-seop marry?

37:38.259 --> 37:41.060
My mother is Lee Soon Ae

37:41.989 --> 37:43.429
Lee Soon Ae

37:43.900 --> 37:45.330
Isn't it from the bus station chamber of commerce?

37:45.400 --> 37:46.630
Is Brother Jiongwan his daughter?

37:50.569 --> 37:51.540
That's it

37:56.839 --> 37:58.310
So to say

37:58.909 --> 38:01.150
Did you know who I was from the beginning?

38:01.909 --> 38:03.650
I only found out after coming here

38:03.980 --> 38:07.219
I had no idea that my father had any relatives or elders

38:07.790 --> 38:08.920
Why

38:09.889 --> 38:11.159
How could you not know me?

38:12.960 --> 38:16.330
It seems you have lost contact

38:17.330 --> 38:19.230
He didn't tell me anything else about you either.

38:23.900 --> 38:24.940
Let's go

38:33.679 --> 38:34.850
This brat

38:45.190 --> 38:47.330
And he said he didn’t believe it at all

38:47.389 --> 38:49.690
He looks hurt, right?

38:49.759 --> 38:50.860
That is to say

38:53.569 --> 38:56.000
I mean, you really weren't hurt, right?

38:56.940 --> 38:57.799
Could it be that he was hit somewhere invisible?

38:57.869 --> 38:59.739
Don't let me know

39:02.009 --> 39:03.509
He's not that kind of person

39:07.549 --> 39:09.150
I'm really scared

39:11.080 --> 39:13.449
What could happen to you or go wrong?

39:25.500 --> 39:27.230
I should be more scared

39:28.199 --> 39:30.299
I'm afraid you'll be in danger because of me

39:31.500 --> 39:33.040
Afraid of messing up everything

39:35.810 --> 39:37.580
Although it seems to have become like this

39:44.750 --> 39:47.420
I will definitely catch the real culprit.

39:47.850 --> 39:49.920
I'll make him pay for all the crimes he's committed so far

39:49.989 --> 39:51.860
pay the price

39:53.290 --> 39:55.159
We are getting closer to this goal

39:56.330 --> 39:58.130
Someone who already knows the appearance of the witness

39:58.199 --> 39:59.429
And the police

40:00.529 --> 40:02.969
At least one police officer will be on our side

40:10.610 --> 40:11.880
On our side?

40:16.080 --> 40:17.580
It doesn't feel like it

40:20.520 --> 40:21.850
Although it is said to be surveillance

40:21.920 --> 40:23.860
But he'll help soon

40:24.060 --> 40:26.690
He has believed half and left the other half

40:27.159 --> 40:28.830
It will be achieved soon

40:30.060 --> 40:31.159
How to do

40:31.600 --> 40:33.429
Because he is absolutely

40:34.230 --> 40:36.369
You can’t win against someone who can predict the future

40:43.409 --> 40:44.480
Wait a moment

40:45.409 --> 40:47.449
- How much - 100 won

40:55.290 --> 40:56.690
What newspaper are you reading?

40:59.020 --> 41:00.790
If it were today’s report on June 7

41:01.230 --> 41:03.860
The headline should be about building a new expressway, right?

41:07.130 --> 41:08.730
From Daejeon to Jinju

41:08.799 --> 41:10.440
And Cheongju to Sangju

41:11.000 --> 41:13.810
And it seems like this from Cheonan to Nonsan

41:18.810 --> 41:20.150
Are you here to spy on me?

41:20.850 --> 41:22.480
The catcher is Kim Dong-ki

41:22.549 --> 41:24.119
Runner prepares for first base

41:24.179 --> 41:25.319
pass touchdown

41:25.380 --> 41:27.089
- It's really boring. - Safety on base.

41:27.790 --> 41:29.589
Not only can I not go out

41:31.860 --> 41:33.560
The ball flew over the outfield

41:33.630 --> 41:36.529
I even know the result of the game

41:36.830 --> 41:39.130
So watching football games is boring

41:40.230 --> 41:42.369
Pintos team 5 points Lions team 4 points

41:42.900 --> 41:44.239
Team Pintos wins

41:50.239 --> 41:51.779
competition is over

42:06.520 --> 42:08.360
He is letting his opponent down today

42:08.429 --> 42:10.600
Yes, if you refer to last year’s competition

42:10.659 --> 42:13.130
It will be interesting today

42:13.199 --> 42:15.369
Count the number of matches between two people

42:15.429 --> 42:17.639
- This is the fifth time - That's right

42:24.610 --> 42:26.639
The player with the red belt will win 3-2.

42:51.440 --> 42:53.770
Just think you're crazy and trust me for once

42:54.940 --> 42:56.569
We don't have time to waste like this

42:57.310 --> 42:59.110
The prisoner who killed three people

42:59.339 --> 43:01.009
It's still fair and square now

43:01.080 --> 43:02.779
Feel free to walk outside

43:23.369 --> 43:25.770
I shouldn't be here anyway

43:27.139 --> 43:28.770
Even if I catch the culprit

43:29.869 --> 43:31.739
I can't deal with him either

43:33.080 --> 43:35.409
In the end, it's up to you as a detective to settle the matter.

43:39.679 --> 43:41.420
I will share the information I have with you

43:42.089 --> 43:43.150
from now on

43:44.290 --> 43:46.060
Let's work together

43:58.170 --> 43:59.670
Are you saying that Go Mi-sook is lying?

44:01.040 --> 44:02.969
She didn't report the real culprit

44:03.610 --> 44:06.179
Instead, they put the blame on Gao Minxiu.

44:08.909 --> 44:10.819
Although Gao Minxiu is indeed suspicious

44:11.580 --> 44:12.880
But I didn’t expect Gao Meishu to treat her family

44:18.190 --> 44:20.860
Although I’m not qualified to say that

44:21.690 --> 44:24.060
You just did that because you wanted to catch the prisoner.

44:24.830 --> 44:26.259
If the real culprit is a family member

44:27.170 --> 44:30.139
Even his family must let him make atonement for his sins

44:33.440 --> 44:35.869
I know when Baek Hee-seop and Baek Yoo-seop were hospitalized

44:36.239 --> 44:37.839
have you been to the hospital

44:40.409 --> 44:41.449
sorry nurse

44:42.250 --> 44:43.250
Hello

44:43.920 --> 44:46.250
Could you please pass it on?

44:47.589 --> 44:48.290
According to the original development

44:48.350 --> 44:50.589
Things will be even worse for both of them than they are now.

44:51.819 --> 44:54.029
What will happen to Baek Hee-seop because of his brother?

44:54.389 --> 44:57.659
Live resenting yourself and others

44:59.360 --> 45:02.600
And you will live in guilt for the rest of your life

45:05.040 --> 45:07.170
Maybe handle this case properly

45:07.810 --> 45:10.139
will be an opportunity to change your future

45:11.880 --> 45:13.440
Of course me too

45:25.389 --> 45:26.460
so what you mean is

45:28.130 --> 45:31.330
Let's work together?

45:37.799 --> 45:38.799
Although we have to wait for the results to come out

45:38.869 --> 45:40.310
to know if you are crazy

45:40.940 --> 45:42.469
But is it because I always come into contact with you?

45:42.540 --> 45:44.210
Why do I feel like I'm crazy too?

45:46.580 --> 45:47.610
So

45:48.779 --> 45:50.420
Just go and see Gao Mi-sook first, okay?

45:57.219 --> 45:59.389
It seems like his dad can still be of help here.

46:03.360 --> 46:06.130
Wait, Yanyu doesn’t know yet.

46:07.330 --> 46:08.770
Dongsik, is that you?

46:11.069 --> 46:12.239
Why are you here so late?

46:12.299 --> 46:13.569
This is Dong-sik

46:15.839 --> 46:19.279
Can Teacher Yin go out with me?

46:20.549 --> 46:21.279
But

46:23.580 --> 46:25.650
I'll take care of you, Dong-sik

46:33.630 --> 46:36.290
Detective Bai also said that I must not go out.

46:37.460 --> 46:40.000
I promised him I'd be with you.

46:41.699 --> 46:43.299
After all, I have a pretty high level of integrity.

46:45.299 --> 46:46.839
Not grandpa

46:50.880 --> 46:52.210
Why are you so surprised?

46:53.210 --> 46:54.409
I'm rather embarrassed

46:55.409 --> 46:57.350
Shouldn't you be used to it by now?

46:57.980 --> 47:00.350
If I say "Haejun"

47:00.549 --> 47:02.350
Just say "it's grandpa"

47:05.719 --> 47:06.790
Oops

47:07.730 --> 47:09.060
this mood

47:10.089 --> 47:11.199
It's really strange

47:14.330 --> 47:16.770
Now that it’s all mentioned, let’s try this

47:16.830 --> 47:18.869
- Please drink - Okay

47:34.420 --> 47:36.489
I've always imagined

47:37.190 --> 47:38.460
Have a drink with the grandson

47:39.560 --> 47:42.089
You accepted the report even before it came out?

47:42.159 --> 47:44.330
That kind of thing is for others to see.

47:44.560 --> 47:46.130
Would I not recognize my own grandson?

47:47.270 --> 47:48.630
We get along so well

47:55.710 --> 47:57.880
Show me your watch

47:58.909 --> 47:59.940
hurry up

48:09.190 --> 48:10.319
I'm here

48:11.219 --> 48:14.759
I have handwritten words engraved on it to give to you.

48:16.230 --> 48:19.100
"Time flies, love still exists"

48:19.759 --> 48:21.069
do you know what this means

48:24.739 --> 48:26.540
Time flies but love lasts forever

48:27.069 --> 48:29.639
You really understand

48:31.480 --> 48:34.279
By the way, why did you carve this? It’s so disgusting.

48:37.520 --> 48:38.580
Yeah

48:41.690 --> 48:42.850
I just want to say

48:43.589 --> 48:46.989
It will feel better to see it when you are tired

48:48.489 --> 48:51.900
I will think of "Grandpa loves me very much"

48:53.400 --> 48:55.869
"I've been looking forward to meeting me since I was born"

48:56.569 --> 48:59.569
“He even bought this watch as a gift to me.”

49:06.710 --> 49:08.449
Even if time passes

49:09.850 --> 49:12.049
One day I left this world

49:13.420 --> 49:14.920
I also hope that I love you

49:14.989 --> 49:16.889
Lasts 100 years 200 years

49:18.659 --> 49:22.659
I can always protect you with this kind of heart.

49:36.009 --> 49:39.239
By the way, who is Yeonwoo’s other half?

49:42.350 --> 49:45.580
So you're talking about Qing'e from Fengfeng Tea House

49:45.650 --> 49:48.089
She is your mother, my daughter-in-law

49:49.150 --> 49:50.219
real or fake

49:50.489 --> 49:53.060
No matter it's true or false, just leave me

49:53.119 --> 49:54.190
Go well

49:54.659 --> 49:56.929
Hey wait, this is it

49:56.989 --> 49:58.699
your mother is right here

49:58.759 --> 49:59.860
keep your voice down

50:00.259 --> 50:03.029
It's okay. Let's go up there.

50:03.569 --> 50:05.839
Go in

50:06.400 --> 50:08.409
and my grandpa

50:08.639 --> 50:11.610
Go and see what your mother is up to now

50:11.679 --> 50:12.940
Hey, what are you looking at?

50:13.009 --> 50:14.610
Why don't you go home quickly?

50:14.679 --> 50:15.880
Let's go

50:17.750 --> 50:20.520
- Take a good walk - I have to go check it out.

50:23.989 --> 50:26.389
Grandpa said everything he said, so he spoke smoothly.

50:27.060 --> 50:28.489
Damn grandpa

50:31.500 --> 50:32.560
Oops

50:33.900 --> 50:36.199
Please drink less wine

50:36.699 --> 50:39.069
You will have a hard time with high blood pressure in the future

50:45.040 --> 50:46.110
Oops

50:52.779 --> 50:55.549
Turns out I’m the damn grandpa

51:01.560 --> 51:03.589
How dare

51:05.900 --> 51:07.630
my precious grandson

52:13.159 --> 52:14.270
congratulations

52:24.909 --> 52:26.380
All meals are free today

52:26.710 --> 52:29.779
Because you are the 20,000th guest at Fengfeng Tea House

52:31.779 --> 52:33.080
What a joke

52:33.719 --> 52:34.750
I was serious

52:35.750 --> 52:37.089
I know you want me to stop talking to you

52:37.150 --> 52:38.920
Don’t recommend meals to you either

52:39.420 --> 52:40.730
But now that you have become the 20,000th guest

52:40.790 --> 52:42.190
I won't give in this time

52:43.159 --> 52:46.060
Sit down and I'll prepare some tea for you

53:12.319 --> 53:13.589
why are you sitting down

53:18.960 --> 53:20.560
You are the 20,000th guest

53:21.699 --> 53:25.500
I want to use this as an excuse to talk to you.

53:27.239 --> 53:29.009
Mr. Yin Haijun

53:31.839 --> 53:34.750
There are so many names, why is it Haejun?

53:35.250 --> 53:38.250
Did your boyfriend tell you my name?

53:39.920 --> 53:41.049
Last time

53:41.819 --> 53:44.790
Why did you look at me like that when we met in front of the theater?

53:46.989 --> 53:48.529
Which kind

53:49.759 --> 53:52.960
Then he treated me like air and kept ignoring me

53:55.770 --> 53:58.170
are you questioning me

53:59.069 --> 54:00.670
That's not true

54:06.610 --> 54:10.150
I should drink more good stuff but I just can’t.

54:12.480 --> 54:14.650
This is my tenth cup of Shuanghe tea

54:15.949 --> 54:17.319
Why can't I drink

54:19.790 --> 54:21.060
Because it’s the last drink

54:21.560 --> 54:23.290
you are the last guest

54:25.299 --> 54:26.699
“The last guest”

54:31.799 --> 54:33.839
I plan to close this cafe

54:36.969 --> 54:38.380
leave this village

54:49.089 --> 54:50.989
Do you want to leave this village?

54:54.060 --> 54:56.060
Yeonwoo, I mean

54:57.060 --> 54:58.500
your boyfriend

54:59.429 --> 55:00.699
does he know

55:01.770 --> 55:03.170
Of course I don't know

55:04.369 --> 55:06.400
I only tell you one person

55:06.770 --> 55:08.110
why me

55:08.869 --> 55:09.969
have no idea

55:10.639 --> 55:12.409
Maybe you're meant to hear this from me.

55:13.009 --> 55:15.049
That's why I happened to appear here

55:15.110 --> 55:18.119
You can almost predict the time when I'm going to let go.

55:20.380 --> 55:23.049
why do you want to leave

55:27.929 --> 55:29.589
Want to know in detail

55:30.460 --> 55:32.460
You should have gotten to know me earlier.

55:33.199 --> 55:34.500
it's too late

55:35.330 --> 55:37.230
It's time for me to prepare

55:53.949 --> 55:55.920
Why are you leaving so soon?

56:11.100 --> 56:12.500
Brother, when did you come back?

56:14.940 --> 56:15.869
Just came back

56:18.880 --> 56:20.139
It's getting late

56:21.279 --> 56:24.679
Really? I was so focused that I didn't notice the time.

56:26.449 --> 56:29.790
And someone forgot to make toast for me again

56:30.589 --> 56:32.920
Sorry you didn't have dinner

56:33.589 --> 56:34.960
No

56:35.029 --> 56:37.060
Being full hinders my thinking

56:42.630 --> 56:43.869
Suffer it now

56:45.369 --> 56:46.739
Misunderstood

56:48.009 --> 56:49.440
I heard you saved people

56:50.509 --> 56:52.440
It turns out you are indeed a good person

56:54.080 --> 56:55.679
I didn't even know I would treat you like that

56:56.850 --> 57:00.449
Oops, it’s time to find my girlfriend

57:01.690 --> 57:03.920
Are you going to find your girlfriend now?

57:03.989 --> 57:07.389
Yes, I've been staying here recently.

57:07.460 --> 57:09.290
Not able to meet often

57:09.589 --> 57:12.060
Maybe she was a little awkward because of this

57:13.199 --> 57:14.900
I need to make up for it quickly.

57:15.000 --> 57:16.830
Okay, save the toast for next time

58:06.319 --> 58:09.150
Did you see your girlfriend yesterday?

58:09.219 --> 58:11.659
Yes, I haven’t had a good date in a long time.

58:12.989 --> 58:14.119
Yeah

58:14.830 --> 58:16.690
Nothing happened, right?

58:16.929 --> 58:19.330
As usual, what's wrong?

58:19.460 --> 58:20.830
should something happen?

58:21.929 --> 58:24.069
Not just a casual question

58:24.770 --> 58:27.639
What are you asking this weird question?

58:30.569 --> 58:32.880
- Here you go - Thank you

58:35.850 --> 58:37.719
There are really many

58:38.420 --> 58:41.920
That's right, why bother sending so many things?

58:42.719 --> 58:44.049
I'm very well

58:44.119 --> 58:46.389
I want to use this to bring you some comfort.

58:46.989 --> 58:49.029
Hope you get over the bad and get back on your feet again

59:22.230 --> 59:23.929
do you feel better now

59:25.259 --> 59:26.330
much better

59:28.799 --> 59:29.900
correct

59:30.730 --> 59:32.369
I heard that you were misunderstood because of me

59:32.440 --> 59:33.699
Suffered a lot

59:35.610 --> 59:38.710
I should have caught the criminal earlier, sorry Soon Ae

59:39.509 --> 59:40.779
don't say that

59:41.509 --> 59:45.219
If it weren't for my teacher, I would have been kidnapped by the criminals long ago

59:46.679 --> 59:48.719
On that dark and scary road

59:48.790 --> 59:50.790
When I see the teacher

59:51.190 --> 59:53.659
At that moment I felt "saved"

59:54.529 --> 59:56.730
Makes me feel more at ease

01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:06.469
By the way, why are you going out?

01:00:09.810 --> 01:00:11.679
You can go out now

01:00:20.949 --> 01:00:23.190
It seems like there are a lot of people coming to visit me.

01:00:23.790 --> 01:00:26.960
Yes, many people from the village came

01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:29.889
You also know the character of our head teacher

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:32.299
Bring a group of classmates over every night

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:34.299
It's so noisy

01:00:35.029 --> 01:00:38.739
Not to mention the quiet recuperation is simply not peaceful.

01:01:42.830 --> 01:01:44.839
How long has this thing been sitting here?

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:32.480
The prisoner has been here before

01:02:37.719 --> 01:02:40.719
Maybe it was to obliterate the traces left by his mistake
