"Perfect Strangers"

00:16.585 --> 00:19.156
"(Kim Dong-wook)"

00:28.926 --> 00:31.595
"(Jin Gi Joo)"

00:40.906 --> 00:44.046
"Perfect Strangers"

00:45.215 --> 00:48.691
Two nights before the teacher died,
she suddenly disappeared

00:48.715 --> 00:50.815
Looks like someone is chasing her

00:50.986 --> 00:53.662
It's very close to the grocery store
so be sure to come here.

00:53.686 --> 00:54.931
"In the last episode..."

00:54.955 --> 00:56.001
Miss Li

00:56.025 --> 00:58.595
- Miss Li-
No, not me!

01:05.936 --> 01:08.111
Who looked at the teacher
and ran away yesterday?

01:08.135 --> 01:09.135
Who is the one?

01:09.336 --> 01:11.605
I think he's the one I've been waiting for

01:11.836 --> 01:14.875
Then I can
see the man in the blue hat again

01:15.045 --> 01:17.383
Ms. Li
stayed in the cafe for 20 minutes...

01:17.408 --> 01:19.077
the only person i met there

01:19.275 --> 01:23.086
But the guy I chased last night
was wearing a blue hat

01:23.286 --> 01:25.685
That's why I plan to witness this for myself

01:45.506 --> 01:49.146
"Perfect Strangers Episode 6
Lie After Lie"

01:49.905 --> 01:51.646
"Episode 6"

02:10.566 --> 02:11.566
Oh my god

02:27.515 --> 02:29.186
Do you know what time it is?

02:32.585 --> 02:33.615
OK...

02:35.126 --> 02:36.226
You know what that feels like...

02:36.925 --> 02:39.656
Waiting for someone who goes out to meet a killer?

02:40.325 --> 02:43.002
You said you just wanted to see his face
, but you disappeared for three hours!

02:43.026 --> 02:44.365
Oh my god, what is that?

02:46.196 --> 02:48.365
She was afraid that she would get hurt following him like last night

02:49.865 --> 02:51.976
- Are you hurt?
- No

02:54.075 --> 02:56.376
I can't call the police
or go out to find you...

02:56.545 --> 02:59.416
Because we live in stupid 1987
and I can't even call you

02:59.776 --> 03:01.446
I almost lost my mind

03:01.946 --> 03:03.145
sorry

03:11.795 --> 03:13.352
Is the man in the blue hat here?

03:17.066 --> 03:18.066
OK...

03:23.536 --> 03:24.705
who is he?

03:29.205 --> 03:31.392
"Three hours ago"

03:31.416 --> 03:34.145
“(Ping Pong Teahouse)”

04:05.645 --> 04:07.015
your father...

04:08.286 --> 04:09.346
"Baek Hee-seop"

04:14.585 --> 04:15.626
Damn it

04:29.105 --> 04:31.675
May 14, 1987

04:32.005 --> 04:34.675
That day the first murder occurred

04:35.745 --> 04:38.172
The man who met the victim Lee Joo-young that day...

04:38.384 --> 04:39.814
Is it her father?

04:43.445 --> 04:46.716
If the man in the blue hat
is the real culprit...

04:48.386 --> 04:50.286
That means he even killed her mother

04:50.855 --> 04:53.156
So he even killed his wife

05:03.136 --> 05:04.466
If I...

05:19.016 --> 05:20.786
I can't be biased

05:21.726 --> 05:24.086
I have to stay calm and objective

05:25.295 --> 05:26.456
Let's summarize

05:33.995 --> 05:35.406
If everything remains the same...

05:35.505 --> 05:38.675
Li Zhuying was supposed to
arrive seven minutes earlier than him

05:38.935 --> 05:40.776
If nothing happens today...

05:41.044 --> 05:43.374
I want to go to a cafe after school

05:44.476 --> 05:46.276
I want to have a cup of coffee alone...

05:46.875 --> 05:48.749
Finish the book you started

05:49.416 --> 05:52.656
I didn't plan on meeting anyone.

05:57.125 --> 06:00.195
But she ends up
meeting someone she wasn't planning on meeting

06:03.666 --> 06:04.771
I don't want to talk about this

06:04.795 --> 06:06.966
The man in the blue hat "Baek Hee-seop"

06:09.836 --> 06:12.981
For whatever reason, the two had a fight.

06:13.005 --> 06:14.382
I told you to stay there!

06:14.406 --> 06:17.105
The only person who witnessed their fight was...

06:18.346 --> 06:19.916
Owner of "Ping Pong Tea House"

06:26.055 --> 06:27.156
where did you go?

06:28.456 --> 06:29.656
welcome

06:36.596 --> 06:38.136
there are more people

06:40.036 --> 06:41.065
I am coming

06:41.636 --> 06:42.742
Oh my God, I'm sorry

06:42.766 --> 06:46.036
I'm late because I
heard some crazy news on the way here

06:48.045 --> 06:50.521
Do you remember what happened at school this morning?

06:50.545 --> 06:51.675
Because of parameters?

06:52.146 --> 06:53.315
Do you know why?

06:54.076 --> 06:55.545
It turns out...

06:59.355 --> 07:00.886
Said she was a communist

07:04.226 --> 07:05.355
Don't you watch the news?

07:06.326 --> 07:09.026
These college students are crazy
and come out to protest

07:10.596 --> 07:12.671
Do you remember that strange song...

07:12.695 --> 07:14.466
Which song did you sing on your school trip?

07:14.865 --> 07:16.666
This is the song people sang at the protests

07:16.691 --> 07:19.600
I bet she wants to influence us too

07:21.846 --> 07:23.505
Isn't this terrible?

07:25.445 --> 07:27.476
- Yeah, it's scary
- isn't it?

07:28.545 --> 07:31.416
Oh my god, just thinking about it
gives me goosebumps

07:32.815 --> 07:34.216
my parents...

07:37.855 --> 07:39.255
Because my friend did this

07:48.105 --> 07:49.305
how do you know?

08:14.125 --> 08:15.365
You said you pooped

08:16.026 --> 08:18.065
But I want to know why there is no smell

08:22.235 --> 08:24.435
Liu Fanling, haven't you finished speaking yet?

08:24.776 --> 08:26.076
Both

08:27.706 --> 08:29.745
I ate a lot today

08:30.076 --> 08:32.021
Look, I don't know what's going on...

08:32.045 --> 08:33.445
But something happened in our school

08:34.216 --> 08:37.616
Police swarmed our school
looking for teachers

08:38.756 --> 08:40.555
- Who are they looking for?
- New parameters

08:43.856 --> 08:45.725
God, that idiot

08:50.896 --> 08:52.372
The bathroom wasn't even cleaned

08:52.396 --> 08:54.065
Damn, this disgusting thing

08:58.675 --> 09:01.705
"Let's use the toilet like we would in our own homes."

09:26.036 --> 09:27.496
Is this for new teachers?

09:28.506 --> 09:29.736
Did you steal it?

09:31.805 --> 09:32.906
will you tell me?

09:35.606 --> 09:36.606
What?

09:37.876 --> 09:39.016
Do...

09:40.416 --> 09:43.045
Would you tell anyone about this ring?

09:45.085 --> 09:46.955
Did you steal it even though you knew it was wrong?

09:47.516 --> 09:49.386
I stole someone else's stuff and hid it in the bathroom

09:50.286 --> 09:52.496
If Sun-ae knew what she had done...

09:52.725 --> 09:53.725
"Sun Ai"?

09:56.195 --> 09:58.136
How do you know my girlfriend's name?

10:00.195 --> 10:01.465
Have you ever thought about...

10:03.036 --> 10:05.075
How much harm would it cause her if she knew?

10:12.845 --> 10:14.416
Don't do anything to embarrass yourself...

10:15.286 --> 10:16.715
in front of your girlfriend

10:17.516 --> 10:19.116
every man should know

10:31.496 --> 10:34.266
Wait, "Hee-seob"

10:34.565 --> 10:35.666
wait

10:37.805 --> 10:38.835
OK

10:39.776 --> 10:40.776
OK

10:41.705 --> 10:42.805
I'll give it back to her

10:42.906 --> 10:44.722
I'll tell her I'm curious...

10:44.746 --> 10:46.315
I personally apologize to her

10:47.246 --> 10:48.486
I'll give it back to her

10:50.286 --> 10:52.916
So give it back to me

10:57.756 --> 10:59.095
I mean

10:59.925 --> 11:02.496
Like I said, I don’t want to do anything…

11:02.965 --> 11:04.666
Might make me feel embarrassed in front of my girlfriend...

11:05.866 --> 11:07.396
In front of you, my friend

11:18.146 --> 11:19.215
I will keep it a secret

11:22.016 --> 11:23.616
I won't tell anyone about this

11:26.616 --> 11:28.185
I'll pretend nothing happened

11:28.776 --> 11:30.157
But you must also keep your promise

11:31.026 --> 11:32.095
OK

11:39.195 --> 11:41.666
thank you my partner

11:43.095 --> 11:45.395
- "Hee-seop"
- "Yoo-seop"

11:49.246 --> 11:50.305
welcome

11:50.646 --> 11:52.075
Be a good friend to my brother

11:52.646 --> 11:53.646
OK

11:54.246 --> 11:55.945
What's wrong?

12:01.685 --> 12:04.585
“(Ping Pong Teahouse)”

12:09.695 --> 12:12.266
Baoling stole Li Zhuying's ring.

12:13.335 --> 12:16.785
Baek Hee-seop was
the man in the blue hat who escaped on the bridge that night.

12:17.296 --> 12:19.798
At that time, Baek Hee-seop
walked out of the cafe with someone.

12:20.475 --> 12:21.475
And Liu Fanling...

12:22.107 --> 12:23.985
He was walking in the same direction as the victim

12:26.226 --> 12:27.734
The path Lee Joo-young has traveled

13:01.575 --> 13:04.986
“(Ping Pong Teahouse)”

13:25.675 --> 13:27.935
"hotel"

13:33.416 --> 13:34.545
"hotel"

13:42.126 --> 13:43.585
hurry up!

13:45.825 --> 13:47.555
Are you kidding me now?

13:47.810 --> 13:48.810
“Takamishu”?

13:52.248 --> 13:53.977
This is extremely unfair

13:54.832 --> 13:56.273
On the day of the incident...

13:56.705 --> 13:58.935
I'm not even in Woojong-ri.

14:00.928 --> 14:04.059
At the time, I was living
in a private boarding school far away from the city

14:06.215 --> 14:08.786
My mother sent me there to focus on my studies

14:11.282 --> 14:14.416
The school is in the middle of a mountain and
there is no landline phone.

14:15.185 --> 14:16.225
Do you want to die?

14:17.455 --> 14:18.526
Why is he here?

14:24.195 --> 14:25.295
Your dear brother...

14:25.666 --> 14:27.065
He's the one who asked

14:27.935 --> 14:29.745
Give it to me and let's end this

14:30.636 --> 14:33.175
Why are you talking to me like this?

14:37.805 --> 14:38.815
wait

14:42.786 --> 14:43.916
Is this your money?

14:46.256 --> 14:48.856
I probably got it from my mom's purse anyway.

14:49.626 --> 14:50.626
Yes or no?

14:51.623 --> 14:52.693
"Mi Shu"

14:56.316 --> 14:57.517
you are such a loser

14:59.896 --> 15:02.435
My mother kicked you out of the house

15:04.705 --> 15:05.805
Don't act like you're strong

15:13.016 --> 15:14.075
Hey...

15:20.256 --> 15:21.256
Are you OK?

15:22.886 --> 15:24.325
Come here, you...

15:31.866 --> 15:32.896
curse

15:36.666 --> 15:37.736
my arms...

15:38.049 --> 15:39.120
you hurt my arm

15:44.920 --> 15:47.759
I'm sorry, my future self,
for saving a filthy scum like you!

15:48.445 --> 15:49.646
What should I do to you?

15:49.815 --> 15:52.055
This is all because of you idiot!

15:52.762 --> 15:54.291
-It's your fault!
- Are you OK?

15:55.571 --> 15:57.931
Go to the nearest public phone and call the police

15:59.095 --> 16:00.550
I don't trust the police system...

16:00.575 --> 16:02.484
But I should at least leave you a record

16:03.565 --> 16:06.565
I'll make sure he pays for what he did this time

16:08.036 --> 16:10.606
Gao Meishu, think about it carefully

16:16.989 --> 16:18.060
I do not want...

16:19.975 --> 16:21.215
contact police

16:33.526 --> 16:35.195
He has some money now

16:37.325 --> 16:40.465
When he has had fun and feels better, he will return to boarding school

16:42.736 --> 16:43.805
that's what i need

16:45.573 --> 16:47.313
If he gets into trouble again...

16:49.020 --> 16:50.591
my mother will punish me

16:53.382 --> 16:54.382
so...

16:58.678 --> 17:01.308
I want this to stay between us

17:26.346 --> 17:28.215
"Wozhuang Hotel"

17:46.666 --> 17:48.865
These kids will never go home

18:01.261 --> 18:03.175
This is the path Lee Joo Young took.

18:04.113 --> 18:05.720
perhaps...

18:05.822 --> 18:08.284
One of the boys I met tonight
is the real culprit.

18:09.225 --> 18:10.386
But I met...

18:11.001 --> 18:13.731
All three suspects tonight

18:19.965 --> 18:20.995
I will keep it a secret

18:22.166 --> 18:23.606
i won't tell anyone

18:24.035 --> 18:27.136
"bathroom"

18:39.416 --> 18:40.416
OK

18:41.038 --> 18:42.038
I'll give it back to her

18:42.063 --> 18:45.192
I will give it back to her and I will apologize to her personally

19:03.445 --> 19:05.146
I will never come to this neighborhood again

19:07.576 --> 19:08.616
Are you happy now?

19:08.685 --> 19:09.816
"direct road"

19:23.425 --> 19:25.296
Everyone I met along the way...

19:25.965 --> 19:28.195
they are lying

19:34.705 --> 19:37.275
Why did they lie?
Why on earth do they do this?

19:47.715 --> 19:49.185
Why are you so quiet?

19:52.845 --> 19:54.073
young man wearing blue hat

19:55.796 --> 19:57.701
He might be the criminal who killed my mother

19:57.725 --> 19:59.336
You saw him in the cafe, right?

20:06.775 --> 20:09.945
who is he? Do we know who he is?

20:13.515 --> 20:15.616
I can't see his face

20:17.316 --> 20:18.856
I lost it like last time

20:20.285 --> 20:21.785
It's my fault, I'm sorry

20:27.525 --> 20:28.525
i lied

20:31.396 --> 20:33.235
You said you weren't hurt, but you were.

20:38.073 --> 20:39.743
You must be hurt every time your shirt touches it

20:40.876 --> 20:42.146
it's not a big deal

20:44.275 --> 20:46.146
How is Miss Li?

20:49.386 --> 20:51.316
She looks worried but she's fine

20:52.455 --> 20:55.755
She was worried that the police might know about it
and come here

20:56.626 --> 20:58.656
She said we'd be in trouble too

21:00.096 --> 21:01.195
Don't worry

21:02.265 --> 21:04.066
No one can come here tonight

21:11.935 --> 21:13.076
"Eunying"

21:14.035 --> 21:15.035
"Eunying"

21:19.854 --> 21:21.255
"Eunying"

21:27.520 --> 21:29.731
If you want to knock on the door...

21:29.755 --> 21:31.725
You shouldn't whisper and vice versa

21:32.255 --> 21:34.626
Don’t you have to choose one way?

21:35.626 --> 21:37.127
I'm sorry for coming so late

21:38.195 --> 21:39.596
Is Yin Ying at home?

21:42.636 --> 21:45.066
Yanying, are you okay?

21:46.376 --> 21:47.406
Why might I not?

21:47.636 --> 21:49.505
I heard all this from my father

21:49.705 --> 21:51.046
He said something terrible happened

21:51.275 --> 21:53.975
Someone had a knife in the grocery store this morning

21:55.316 --> 21:56.601
you must be scared

21:58.685 --> 22:00.586
- Nothing important
- Is this possible?

22:02.455 --> 22:03.525
Incidentally...

22:04.755 --> 22:08.326
Are you going to let Eun-young sleep here tonight?

22:08.995 --> 22:10.396
with you?

22:11.296 --> 22:12.296
What?

22:13.336 --> 22:15.705
Well, I mean...

22:16.265 --> 22:18.606
Can she stay with me for one night?

22:19.876 --> 22:23.275
Well, that would be great

22:24.906 --> 22:27.146
I did not expect

22:29.215 --> 22:30.245
you can let it go

22:33.056 --> 22:35.586
No, it's okay,
it's just a misunderstanding

22:39.396 --> 22:41.626
Just go and take a rest...

22:42.626 --> 22:43.850
Use this as an excuse to relax

22:45.495 --> 22:47.535
I came here after she died

22:48.935 --> 22:51.005
Relax for at least one night

22:52.066 --> 22:54.576
In addition to your mother, this is also a good opportunity

23:37.485 --> 23:38.955
Is my room a mess?

23:39.616 --> 23:41.255
Although I arranged it

23:41.586 --> 23:43.185
My mother always pats me on the back

23:44.156 --> 23:47.425
She even threatened me
that she would throw away all my stuff

23:48.525 --> 23:50.396
My mother is like this too

23:50.465 --> 23:51.465
Really?

23:52.455 --> 23:54.599
Moms, do you have any questions?

23:56.806 --> 24:00.005
I would never do that to my daughter

24:02.775 --> 24:04.981
I'm going to take a shower. You're welcome.

24:05.005 --> 24:06.515
Okay, let's take a shower

24:26.013 --> 24:27.073
Both

24:28.136 --> 24:29.465
Why should he hide it?

24:44.245 --> 24:45.515
Who are you calling...

24:46.685 --> 24:47.916
this late?

24:48.785 --> 24:50.162
You said you've been worried all day

24:51.386 --> 24:52.656
let me check

24:54.955 --> 24:57.971
"Wu Zong Restaurant"

24:57.995 --> 25:00.566
Do I really need to check?

25:00.695 --> 25:03.666
- It's messy enough here
- "The one I miss"

25:04.235 --> 25:05.711
well done!

25:05.735 --> 25:08.312
"I miss her"

25:08.336 --> 25:10.445
Yes, everyone here

25:10.721 --> 25:12.030
- President Yoon
- Wait

25:12.055 --> 25:13.991
what are you doing here?
now you

25:14.015 --> 25:15.745
yes ok

25:16.445 --> 25:17.886
Hold on

25:18.646 --> 25:20.877
- Come on
- Everyone applaud!

25:23.285 --> 25:24.386
OK

25:24.586 --> 25:27.356
President Yoon wants to sing, let’s help him sing

25:29.126 --> 25:32.166
No, I can't sing

25:32.965 --> 25:35.096
I only wish the police officers happiness...

25:35.265 --> 25:37.765
Those who work tirelessly day and night

25:38.005 --> 25:39.973
Keep Houzongli
away from crime

25:40.535 --> 25:41.806
that's all i need to hear

25:42.005 --> 25:43.675
Applaud President Yoon!

25:46.376 --> 25:49.062
As I said before...

25:49.086 --> 25:51.316
Today's reception is for the peace of our city

25:51.515 --> 25:54.156
Don't even think about going home tonight

25:54.685 --> 25:58.126
Eat and drink as much as you want

25:59.425 --> 26:00.572
- OK!
- let's go!

26:00.596 --> 26:03.701
Cheers to the happiness and prosperity of Hojongri Police!

26:03.725 --> 26:06.666
- cheers!
- cheers!

26:08.666 --> 26:09.765
Oh my god

26:11.205 --> 26:13.275
Grill more meat too

26:13.836 --> 26:15.705
Can we drink more?

26:17.906 --> 26:19.475
what have you done?

26:20.675 --> 26:24.515
As a principal, how could he not know that
there would be a person with a criminal record as our teacher?

26:24.715 --> 26:28.416
she tried to help me

26:28.556 --> 26:31.062
I make sure everyone finishes what they start

26:31.086 --> 26:32.386
So don't worry about this

26:34.626 --> 26:37.465
Yes, as we discussed before...

26:37.695 --> 26:40.136
Please keep everyone there until sunrise

26:42.505 --> 26:44.406
I'll get you a drink, good job

26:47.205 --> 26:48.975
you sit

26:53.775 --> 26:57.715
Can't you see we're cleaning up
the mess you made after you made a mess in the school?

26:58.445 --> 26:59.455
move

26:59.985 --> 27:03.326
President Kim said he felt very embarrassed facing Chairman Yoon.

27:07.596 --> 27:11.425
To be honest, there are no clear charges against him

27:11.725 --> 27:12.735
tell me the truth

27:13.035 --> 27:17.235
I just want to blame the protesters from Seoul
for improving your image

27:29.076 --> 27:32.146
I say if you look suspicious it's your fault

27:33.132 --> 27:36.803
You also said that if you were trying to manipulate someone
you could easily make up some crime

27:38.056 --> 27:39.356
To improve my image?

27:39.556 --> 27:41.525
I wonder who needs to do this

27:44.096 --> 27:45.425
You bastard, how dare you?

27:45.495 --> 27:47.465
- Stay away from me
- Are you crazy?

27:49.306 --> 27:52.306
I have to pick up my kids

27:52.406 --> 27:54.205
- Oh my God, you idiot.
- For you.

27:54.876 --> 27:56.406
What do you two think you're doing?

27:58.175 --> 28:00.376
I started to calm down

28:01.015 --> 28:03.316
-Are you really doing this?
- sorry

28:04.046 --> 28:06.086
- Dong
-sik- Yes

28:08.715 --> 28:11.425
Where are Young Woo and Young Soon?
Isn't she at home?

28:12.485 --> 28:14.455
My wife went to visit her parents...

28:14.826 --> 28:16.971
To take care of my sick father

28:16.995 --> 28:17.995
OK

28:18.166 --> 28:21.096
I left the children at home
by the persimmon tree.

28:21.866 --> 28:22.906
Understood

28:26.235 --> 28:27.576
Especially Baek Dong-sik

28:28.535 --> 28:30.975
Bring all the police to our school today

28:31.205 --> 28:33.745
He turned the whole place upside down

28:35.275 --> 28:37.346
We never know when or what he will do next

28:38.316 --> 28:40.156
it's not a big problem

28:40.386 --> 28:42.755
Look at the current time

28:42.856 --> 28:45.056
let them spend the night there

28:45.725 --> 28:48.695
Sit down, everyone, sit down

28:50.265 --> 28:52.525
your kids will love it

28:52.796 --> 28:54.636
The boss's grandson is about the same age as your child, right?

28:55.836 --> 28:57.505
- Am I right?
- OK

28:57.636 --> 29:00.112
I'll also call the lady of the house

29:00.136 --> 29:02.035
Don't worry about that

29:02.275 --> 29:03.951
Until sunrise...

29:03.975 --> 29:05.120
Okay, get me a drink

29:05.475 --> 29:07.076
Just stay here

29:07.146 --> 29:08.416
- Okay
- let's go

29:08.846 --> 29:10.921
President Yoon, I deeply apologize for causing confusion.

29:10.945 --> 29:11.842
It's okay, drink it

29:11.867 --> 29:14.612
Everyone, get ready to sing for President Yoon!

29:14.715 --> 29:15.785
- Oh my god
- Yes!

29:16.826 --> 29:18.525
one two three four

30:09.035 --> 30:10.306
Is something bothering you?

30:11.475 --> 30:13.346
I noticed you never sleep

30:14.245 --> 30:15.346
Are you awake?

30:20.156 --> 30:21.255
All this is...

30:24.626 --> 30:26.096
I can't get it out of my head

30:27.425 --> 30:28.455
what is it?

30:31.695 --> 30:34.366
What bothers you so much
that you can't sleep?

30:38.005 --> 30:39.136
"Baek Hee-seop"

30:40.376 --> 30:42.435
What? So fast?

30:42.975 --> 30:45.945
Listen, you said you still have a boyfriend

30:48.745 --> 30:50.116
I'm the worst

30:51.015 --> 30:52.715
what should I do?

30:54.356 --> 30:55.685
God this gives me a headache

30:57.755 --> 31:00.025
I thought I could relax for a night

31:01.056 --> 31:02.056
listen

31:03.296 --> 31:05.296
Hee-seop and I have only known each other for a short time.

31:05.965 --> 31:08.995
He doesn't even know you that well

31:11.906 --> 31:13.735
That's why I asked him

31:16.876 --> 31:18.447
When I met him at Pong Pong Café

31:33.725 --> 31:34.896
Incidentally...

31:35.995 --> 31:37.695
Why do you like me so much?

31:38.396 --> 31:39.596
you don't know me very well

31:40.796 --> 31:42.671
You were transferred a few days ago...

31:42.695 --> 31:44.465
And you don't even know who I am

31:44.606 --> 31:45.806
Why might I not know you?

31:46.596 --> 31:49.257
As soon as I met you, I discovered your essence

31:50.076 --> 31:51.576
What kind of girl am I?

31:52.005 --> 31:53.346
a great girl

32:05.126 --> 32:06.156
Too...

32:07.126 --> 32:09.396
you have your own world

32:13.566 --> 32:15.035
When I first met you...

32:15.596 --> 32:16.965
In that cabin...

32:17.304 --> 32:19.643
You are listening to your favorite song on the radio

32:20.035 --> 32:21.306
Very focused on writing...

32:22.166 --> 32:23.697
That you didn't even notice me standing there

32:25.306 --> 32:27.715
I'm too busy in the world I've created

32:28.316 --> 32:30.586
you don't know how beautiful you look

32:31.215 --> 32:32.721
And that cabin...

32:32.745 --> 32:35.156
She shines like a star, just because you are here

32:36.856 --> 32:38.525
"I don't care about anything in this world"

32:40.255 --> 32:42.296
you just smile alone

32:45.055 --> 32:46.055
In fact...

32:47.636 --> 32:51.166
I've never met anyone as good as you

32:53.182 --> 32:56.275
He shines like a star in front of me

33:00.445 --> 33:02.745
What he told me...

33:04.515 --> 33:07.315
And the expression on his face when he spoke...

33:10.225 --> 33:12.326
in his low, hesitant voice

33:13.886 --> 33:14.947
everything is shiny

33:22.636 --> 33:24.366
"A moment that never ends"

33:24.836 --> 33:26.435
"small door"

33:28.635 --> 33:30.351
"Message 25"

33:30.376 --> 33:31.846
"You know what, Y?"

33:36.275 --> 33:37.545
"For a moment..."

33:38.267 --> 33:40.706
"It never ends"

33:45.326 --> 33:48.796
I think of
those beautiful words he said to me that day

33:49.695 --> 33:51.796
repeatedly

33:53.666 --> 33:56.265
Get out, if you want to keep doing this...

33:56.765 --> 33:59.935
Spend the rest of your life doing this

34:23.325 --> 34:26.666
Whatever future darkness may befall me...

34:27.466 --> 34:30.666
If you can keep these shining moments...

34:32.443 --> 34:34.773
I thought nothing in the world could scare me

34:36.667 --> 34:39.568
It only took him a moment to see my world

34:41.816 --> 34:43.745
I want to know what his world is like

34:45.622 --> 34:47.131
I'm always curious...

34:47.986 --> 34:49.216
about the shape of his world

34:53.649 --> 34:56.249
The man in my mother’s novel…

34:57.126 --> 34:58.126
he is...

34:58.896 --> 35:00.466
"Baek Hee-seop"

35:03.705 --> 35:04.765
What?

35:17.013 --> 35:18.083
Are you going to bed?

35:19.115 --> 35:20.816
what should I do?

35:26.630 --> 35:27.630
"Baek Hee-seop"

35:37.736 --> 35:41.276
I'm here because I want to give something back to her

35:41.805 --> 35:42.905
for new teachers

35:55.083 --> 35:56.924
I'm going out...

35:59.563 --> 36:00.592
walk a little

36:00.896 --> 36:02.696
He is one of the three suspects

36:02.996 --> 36:04.571
And the mysterious man in the blue hat

36:05.666 --> 36:07.535
His position is consistent with that of Lee Joo Young.

36:08.135 --> 36:10.606
So far, he's the prime suspect

36:11.295 --> 36:12.356
but...

36:13.475 --> 36:16.575
If he told Liu Fanling to return the ring, why did he kill her?

36:17.091 --> 36:18.621
some things don't make sense

36:22.567 --> 36:24.266
Or am I hoping for something similar?

36:34.196 --> 36:35.926
"Wozhuang Hotel"

36:36.225 --> 36:38.055
I brought all my important possessions

36:38.995 --> 36:40.566
- Let's go.
- Okay.

36:53.115 --> 36:54.991
"From Hou Zhongli to Yuanzu"

36:55.015 --> 36:56.015
curse

36:56.526 --> 36:58.831
How did I
get involved with that dangerous neighbor?

37:05.955 --> 37:08.626
There will be no danger if you leave the village

37:08.995 --> 37:09.995
But just to make sure...

37:10.396 --> 37:12.580
Call me as soon as you get to your friend's house

37:12.865 --> 37:14.836
- The landline number is...
- I know.

37:17.435 --> 37:19.606
You gave me your number as soon as I got here.

37:27.689 --> 37:29.758
I know it doesn't make sense...

37:30.929 --> 37:32.168
But it seems you...

37:33.916 --> 37:36.555
You came here just to save me

37:38.455 --> 37:40.955
It's like you knew I'd be here and
you were waiting for me

37:41.796 --> 37:43.526
It's like you thought...

37:44.926 --> 37:47.635
Helped me in some way for a long time

37:48.966 --> 37:50.035
it's out of the question

37:50.736 --> 37:51.736
correct

37:52.365 --> 37:55.376
I know it's impossible
but you helped me like you really did it

37:56.506 --> 37:57.575
Thanks

37:59.158 --> 38:00.828
Laura, your presence...

38:02.146 --> 38:04.146
i don't know what will happen to me

38:07.086 --> 38:08.332
Thank you so much

38:08.356 --> 38:12.825
"Youzong Grocery Store"

38:13.626 --> 38:14.655
Help yourself

38:17.666 --> 38:19.066
Don't lose him again

38:21.696 --> 38:22.865
I wish you a happy life...

38:23.236 --> 38:26.506
Enjoy a healthy and long life until old age

38:28.075 --> 38:29.236
The same to you

38:35.316 --> 38:36.475
The bus is coming

38:49.917 --> 38:50.957
give yourself to me

39:06.146 --> 39:07.676
God this is so annoying

39:11.946 --> 39:13.385
Has the bus arrived?

39:24.495 --> 39:26.595
Hey!

39:28.336 --> 39:30.135
Hey!

39:30.736 --> 39:31.736
curse

39:33.975 --> 39:35.035
for your own good

39:53.178 --> 39:55.577
You fool, you!

39:57.566 --> 39:58.595
you bastard

39:59.296 --> 40:02.635
When I was under the bridge that night,
she secretly sent me signals to help her

40:03.196 --> 40:04.968
How dare you let the police help protesters?

40:05.135 --> 40:07.405
When I realized what I had done...

40:08.679 --> 40:11.520
I thought you were just a forgetful teacher

40:12.606 --> 40:14.046
Are you one of them?

40:14.729 --> 40:15.729
is that so?

40:17.559 --> 40:19.068
How much did you drink?

40:19.816 --> 40:20.991
"one of them"?

40:21.015 --> 40:22.756
I was just passing by there

40:22.968 --> 40:23.968
Is it correct?

40:24.825 --> 40:26.486
I'll find the truth when I start looking

40:27.179 --> 40:29.068
Let's have this conversation at the center, shall we?

40:29.093 --> 40:31.026
Why did you take me away when I didn't do anything?

40:31.325 --> 40:33.701
Stop talking and come with me, you bastard

40:33.726 --> 40:34.726
OMG

40:53.785 --> 40:55.716
Oh my god, how could this happen?

40:56.115 --> 40:58.426
- Hey
- Yeah

41:00.256 --> 41:02.396
what happened? Is there a fire?

41:02.824 --> 41:05.994
A fire broke out in the house next to the persimmon tree.

41:06.865 --> 41:08.341
What? Where?

41:08.365 --> 41:11.166
The house next to the persimmon tree where
the boy lives with his grandmother

41:12.233 --> 41:15.236
God, I hope they're okay.
what should we do?

41:16.459 --> 41:18.258
On May 15, a fire accident occurred

41:19.290 --> 41:20.630
no one died

41:22.646 --> 41:24.516
My two children are in that house.

41:28.285 --> 41:31.086
what are you saying?
There should only be two people inside

41:33.416 --> 41:35.646
I had to pick them up last night

41:38.239 --> 41:39.310
but I can not

41:41.908 --> 41:42.950
Both

41:43.135 --> 41:45.135
God no

41:45.365 --> 41:48.482
Honey, what are we going to do, Dong-sik?

41:48.506 --> 41:49.776
- "Young Woo"
- None

41:50.876 --> 41:52.805
No, oh my god

41:55.475 --> 41:57.515
Yingyu, Yingshun!

42:00.515 --> 42:01.515
"Youngwoo!"

42:02.216 --> 42:03.385
Yingyu, Yingshun!

42:05.225 --> 42:07.131
Yingyu, Yingshun!

42:07.155 --> 42:08.995
- there
- she's here

42:09.655 --> 42:11.542
- Yingshun, it's your father.
- Your father is here.

42:11.566 --> 42:12.566
Are you OK?

42:13.736 --> 42:15.236
"Xiao Sun!"

42:15.836 --> 42:17.365
Sorry, Yang Shun.

42:22.106 --> 42:24.075
- Get the old lady out
- Madam

42:24.546 --> 42:25.951
Where are the rest of the kids?

42:25.975 --> 42:27.051
I have no idea

42:27.075 --> 42:30.385
I think I got my grandson out of there

42:34.486 --> 42:37.185
Oh my god, the house is falling down.

42:37.586 --> 42:38.801
- Oh my God
- What are we going to do?

42:38.826 --> 42:39.886
"Youngwoo!"

42:40.526 --> 42:41.571
"Youngwoo!"

42:41.595 --> 42:42.896
"Youngwoo!"

42:43.466 --> 42:44.566
"Youngwoo!"

42:46.696 --> 42:47.736
"Youngwoo!"

42:49.535 --> 42:50.606
"Youngwoo!"

42:52.106 --> 42:53.111
"Youngwoo!"

42:53.135 --> 42:55.535
"Youngwoo!"

42:56.435 --> 42:58.776
- "Yang Yu"!
- "Yang Yu"!

42:59.046 --> 43:01.515
Can you stop them
from going out before sunrise?

43:01.816 --> 43:03.075
Especially Baek Dong-sik

43:04.115 --> 43:06.546
Bring all the police to our school today...

43:07.316 --> 43:09.885
He turned the whole place upside down

43:10.225 --> 43:12.385
I should have picked them up yesterday

43:14.926 --> 43:16.196
but I can not

43:17.265 --> 43:18.365
"Youngwoo!"

43:18.825 --> 43:19.926
"Youngwoo!"

43:22.635 --> 43:23.705
"Youngwoo!"

43:24.736 --> 43:25.765
God he's so hot

43:26.975 --> 43:28.236
"Youngwoo!"

43:30.276 --> 43:31.506
"Youngwoo!"

43:32.646 --> 43:33.745
"Youngwoo!"

43:34.946 --> 43:35.975
"Youngwoo!"

43:36.845 --> 43:37.946
"Youngwoo!"

43:38.946 --> 43:40.155
Detective Parker, here we come!

43:40.455 --> 43:41.955
- "Yang Yu"!
- here

43:42.486 --> 43:43.685
Take him out quickly

43:44.885 --> 43:46.926
"Youngwoo!"

43:49.296 --> 43:51.495
"Youngwoo!"

43:53.066 --> 43:54.495
Come on, Yongwoo

43:55.466 --> 43:56.796
Yongyu, stay with me

43:57.765 --> 43:58.865
"Xiao Wu"

43:59.466 --> 44:02.276
"Xiao Wu"

44:03.575 --> 44:05.245
Yongyu, are you okay?

44:06.205 --> 44:07.622
I'm very sorry

44:07.646 --> 44:10.491
- Thank God
- That's good

44:10.515 --> 44:13.192
-His father saved him
. -You are wonderful

44:13.216 --> 44:15.026
- Very close
- Very good

44:15.051 --> 44:16.462
"Houzongli Fire Brigade"

44:16.487 --> 44:17.686
“Hiko”

44:19.385 --> 44:20.401
uncle dongshik

44:20.426 --> 44:22.555
Your teacher must go to the hospital

44:22.756 --> 44:23.796
excuse me?

44:30.535 --> 44:31.805
you were seriously injured

44:32.736 --> 44:33.876
Let's go to the hospital

44:41.546 --> 44:44.146
what are you waiting for? Let's leave right away

44:54.296 --> 44:57.296
"In case of fire, please call emergency number 119"

45:03.336 --> 45:06.305
What did I do to keep Lee Joo Young safe...

45:06.865 --> 45:08.405
Create another variable...

45:09.305 --> 45:11.646
This variable creates another situation

45:17.015 --> 45:19.185
I saved a man who might have died...

45:20.385 --> 45:24.026
But on the other hand, I almost created a
person who should have lived...

45:24.856 --> 45:25.885
he died

45:43.019 --> 45:44.120
it's somewhere around here

45:58.356 --> 45:59.685
Did you lose Miss Li...

46:02.095 --> 46:03.356
What happened?

46:04.926 --> 46:05.896
not much

46:06.825 --> 46:09.196
Did you and your mother have a good time?

46:10.836 --> 46:11.836
OK

46:12.966 --> 46:14.135
Why are you carrying this?

46:16.252 --> 46:17.821
i think i can figure it out

46:18.276 --> 46:20.515
- Find out what?
- The identity of the man in the blue hat

46:21.345 --> 46:22.416
Answer...

46:23.446 --> 46:24.986
Maybe in this text

46:37.466 --> 46:39.225
A novel is not a report...

46:41.336 --> 46:43.411
Although it is based on a true story...

46:43.435 --> 46:45.836
This does not mean that real names were used

46:46.836 --> 46:50.269
At first I thought Gao Meishi
was not writing about a man wearing a blue hat.

46:51.546 --> 46:54.075
But then I remembered that there was a similar sentence

46:55.975 --> 46:57.446
"Blue Headed Man"

46:59.015 --> 47:01.015
all the time...

47:01.885 --> 47:03.955
I thought it meant he had blue hair

47:09.526 --> 47:11.296
In the end what happened?

47:12.796 --> 47:14.896
Do I have to tell you everything?

47:16.336 --> 47:19.865
Do I have to share
every little detail of what's going on here?

47:20.127 --> 47:21.397
And you?

47:22.376 --> 47:24.606
Are we that close?

47:34.716 --> 47:35.856
You know that, right?

47:40.325 --> 47:41.426
blue hat

47:43.696 --> 47:45.325
you're not even curious

47:48.666 --> 47:50.135
You know who he is, don't you?

47:51.765 --> 47:53.606
You didn't waste it in a cafe

47:58.245 --> 47:59.676
You don't need to tell me...

47:59.975 --> 48:03.422
But there is a reason why you hid it from me.
what is it then?

48:03.446 --> 48:05.745
I think you misunderstood something

48:06.745 --> 48:07.955
think carefully

48:08.814 --> 48:10.931
If you're here to hide something...

48:11.049 --> 48:13.779
Why should I go to great lengths
to catch criminals?

48:15.455 --> 48:17.086
Because I feel sorry for the victim?

48:18.126 --> 48:20.126
The world is full of tragedies like this

48:20.796 --> 48:23.836
I don't have time to save all these people

48:25.765 --> 48:26.935
So what is the reason?

48:31.245 --> 48:32.606
I am also a victim

48:33.776 --> 48:35.075
fifth victim

48:38.298 --> 48:40.814
I will die like your mother in the future

48:41.153 --> 48:43.353
Because the real culprit hasn't been caught yet

48:44.126 --> 48:46.256
You came here to save my life.

48:46.356 --> 48:49.902
I transcribed every newspaper report,
news broadcast, and case file…

48:49.926 --> 48:51.942
Associated with this village since 1987...

48:51.966 --> 48:53.526
to my head

48:54.365 --> 48:57.205
But everything could be in vain because of one variable

48:58.805 --> 49:01.435
That alone makes me feel like my head is going to explode.

49:03.876 --> 49:05.106
But you know what?

49:07.615 --> 49:09.975
Do you know who the biggest variable is?

49:12.986 --> 49:15.555
Is this why you sent me to be with my mom last night?

49:18.586 --> 49:21.126
"Don't even wonder about the variables."

49:22.896 --> 49:24.225
"Don't get in my way"

49:25.365 --> 49:26.466
"Don't interfere"

49:28.566 --> 49:30.095
Is this what you want to say?

49:34.736 --> 49:36.506
Sorry, but I can't

49:38.176 --> 49:39.838
Now that I've come this far...

49:40.845 --> 49:43.015
I don't want to stand idly by like a fool

49:45.960 --> 49:47.587
If you don't want to tell me that's your business

49:49.216 --> 49:50.756
I'll find out for myself

50:04.066 --> 50:05.736
I feel uncomfortable

50:08.475 --> 50:10.546
What if Fan Ling cries and becomes attached to me?

50:11.745 --> 50:13.946
He said I'm the only one in his life

50:16.615 --> 50:17.745
What's your job?

50:19.086 --> 50:20.345
"Baek Eun-young"

50:27.325 --> 50:30.225
"The afternoon the first victim's body was discovered..."

50:31.396 --> 50:34.635
"Some people
started acting strange."

50:35.935 --> 50:37.542
"The blue-haired man..."

50:37.566 --> 50:40.006
"He always seemed to stand between the sun and the moon."

50:41.035 --> 50:42.635
"The man wearing glasses..."

50:43.236 --> 50:45.975
"He spent a long time in the third toilet."

50:47.146 --> 50:48.776
"The man who lost his memory..."

50:49.376 --> 50:52.185
"He was lying under the bridge and they didn't know who he was."

50:54.216 --> 50:59.086
"The blue-haired man stood
between the sun and the moon for what seemed like forever."

51:00.126 --> 51:02.725
Li Zhuying was found dead on this day

51:04.225 --> 51:05.966
So this part is about the current era

51:07.495 --> 51:11.236
If "the man with the blue head"
really means the man with the blue hat...

51:11.836 --> 51:15.336
"Sun and Moon"

51:16.006 --> 51:17.845
Where would it be "between the sun and the moon"?

51:18.946 --> 51:19.946
I have no idea

51:20.845 --> 51:23.276
What's this? scared me

51:26.946 --> 51:28.785
Go see Liu Fanling

51:29.916 --> 51:31.962
you have to deal with it one way or another

51:33.825 --> 51:35.225
Ok, i will

51:39.626 --> 51:42.135
BTW, don’t hang out with the guy who wrote this

51:46.535 --> 51:47.676
I do not like it

51:48.006 --> 51:49.975
How do you know I didn't write this?

51:50.376 --> 51:51.446
Are you a dummy?

51:52.075 --> 51:54.245
It is impossible for what you write not to be understood

51:54.615 --> 51:56.022
The author should know everything...

51:56.515 --> 51:58.546
Because every word of his has been carefully chosen

52:02.916 --> 52:03.955
See you later

52:17.833 --> 52:20.303
In 30 years you won't know anything I wrote

53:25.236 --> 53:26.236
"Hey, Jun!"

53:27.236 --> 53:29.681
- "Hey Jun!"
- Can I strangle you?

53:29.705 --> 53:30.776
wait

53:57.652 --> 53:59.750
"First crime, second crime"

54:04.805 --> 54:06.575
"The First Murder"

54:26.265 --> 54:27.666
"Investigation Report"

55:01.935 --> 55:03.495
I heard that Mr. Yin was injured

55:06.773 --> 55:08.052
If you need help please let me know

55:09.305 --> 55:12.405
Because I'm still grateful for what I did.

55:13.506 --> 55:14.546
if...

55:15.774 --> 55:17.714
What happened to Gao Minxiu made you happy.

55:26.012 --> 55:29.370
"The blue-haired man stood
between the sun and the moon for what seemed like forever."

55:35.572 --> 55:37.333
If there is such a sentence...

55:38.506 --> 55:40.805
What does "between the sun and the moon" mean?

55:48.012 --> 55:49.383
how could I know?

55:57.586 --> 55:58.856
I don't need to ask her

56:01.201 --> 56:02.841
Isn't that the name of the record store?

56:14.166 --> 56:16.475
"Record Store (Sun and Moon)"

56:17.845 --> 56:19.321
"sun"

56:19.345 --> 56:21.345
"Guitar Lesson"

57:06.185 --> 57:10.225
"Record Store (Sun and Moon)"

57:52.606 --> 57:54.676
Do you know what time it is?

57:59.805 --> 58:00.845
if...

58:01.515 --> 58:04.845
You know that feeling when you hear someone waiting after school early?

58:06.905 --> 58:08.660
Because we live in the stupid year of 1987…

58:08.685 --> 58:10.443
I can't even reach you

58:17.966 --> 58:18.995
sorry

58:21.466 --> 58:23.172
I know I have to tell you...

58:23.196 --> 58:25.066
But I hid the truth from you

58:26.340 --> 58:28.955
But I didn't send you with your mother to get rid of you
or anything like that.

58:30.842 --> 58:31.912
I know

58:35.269 --> 58:37.544
The man in the blue hat is...

58:37.569 --> 58:38.799
I know too

58:42.262 --> 58:43.762
I saw it with my own eyes

58:45.256 --> 58:48.825
I also think I know why you had no choice
but to hide the truth from me

58:51.039 --> 58:52.169
Because we are a family

58:54.765 --> 58:56.595
He is just one of the suspects

59:01.836 --> 59:03.106
I actually don't like him very much...

59:04.575 --> 59:07.446
But I didn't expect him
to be so cruel

59:09.146 --> 59:11.986
my father loves him very much

59:14.816 --> 59:15.856
Even more than he loves us

59:19.169 --> 59:20.269
excuse me?

59:22.678 --> 59:23.678
What?

59:24.396 --> 59:25.396
I mean...

59:27.194 --> 59:29.265
Who are you talking about now?

59:29.935 --> 59:32.511
I thought we were talking about the man in the blue hat

59:32.535 --> 59:33.566
Exactly

59:34.210 --> 59:37.496
Why does Baek Hee-seop love himself so much?

59:41.020 --> 59:43.991
Are you saying the man in the blue hat is my father?

59:48.455 --> 59:49.955
So who did you see?

59:52.526 --> 59:54.995
"Record Store (Sun and Moon)"

01:00:25.555 --> 01:00:26.926
I saw my uncle

01:00:28.155 --> 01:00:29.155
"Bai Ruxie"

01:00:30.569 --> 01:00:32.638
Baek Yeo-seop isn’t even a suspect…

01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:35.495
He wasn't there last night

01:00:51.416 --> 01:00:53.015
Everything makes sense now

01:01:07.526 --> 01:01:08.642
"(pingpong)"

01:01:08.666 --> 01:01:12.765
"in conclusion"

01:01:13.611 --> 01:01:14.611
"Yo Subbu"

01:01:15.965 --> 01:01:18.028
what are you doing here?
It's not even the weekend

01:01:18.634 --> 01:01:20.935
I was supposed to meet someone here
but I don't think he showed up

01:01:21.218 --> 01:01:23.646
- And you?
-I'm also here to meet someone.

01:01:24.146 --> 01:01:26.816
- Do you want to come with me?
- It's okay, it's crowded inside.

01:01:27.168 --> 01:01:29.285
If you finish soon, I'll wait for you outside

01:01:29.416 --> 01:01:30.832
- Can you?
- certainly

01:01:30.856 --> 01:01:32.225
i want it

01:01:35.896 --> 01:01:37.995
OMG your hat is so cool

01:01:47.905 --> 01:01:49.635
for you

01:01:50.519 --> 01:01:51.519
let me see

01:01:51.752 --> 01:01:53.322
Oh my gosh, it suits you so well.

01:01:53.975 --> 01:01:55.745
It looks better on me, doesn't it?

01:01:57.297 --> 01:01:59.098
-Don't be late-
Okay, Yoo Seob.

01:02:50.865 --> 01:02:54.641
These files do not contain any information about Baek You Sub

01:02:54.801 --> 01:02:57.135
No one knows Baek You-seop better than me

01:02:57.176 --> 01:02:59.106
I'll provide you with everything you need

01:02:59.146 --> 01:03:00.982
If Baek Yeo-seop is the culprit...

01:03:01.006 --> 01:03:02.752
We'll see him again tomorrow night...

01:03:02.777 --> 01:03:04.978
Because he had to kill the second victim

01:03:05.128 --> 01:03:06.905
Where is he?

01:03:06.976 --> 01:03:09.005
- We're looking everywhere
- This isn't going to happen anytime soon

01:03:09.385 --> 01:03:10.385
welcome
