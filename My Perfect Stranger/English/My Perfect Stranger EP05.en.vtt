"The Stranger I Met"
Episode 5

00:16.623 --> 00:19.092
(Wu Gang Dumu)

00:28.873 --> 00:31.542
(Kyung Gi Joo)

00:40.853 --> 00:44.052
"A Stranger I Met"

00:45.993 --> 00:48.321
Two days before the first murder

00:48.322 --> 00:51.332
One of the three suspects
has been arrested

00:51.432 --> 00:52.931
the other two

00:52.932 --> 00:54.603
Nothing special yet

00:55.463 --> 00:58.472
When everything is so chaotic

00:59.273 --> 01:01.002
She is coming

01:01.472 --> 01:04.643
He is the first victim of Wu Zongri's serial murder case

01:05.243 --> 01:06.273
she

01:06.472 --> 01:09.411
The teacher who will be with you throughout the month

01:09.412 --> 01:10.882
It’s teacher Li Zhouying

01:10.953 --> 01:12.152
- Seoul National University..
- Where..

01:12.153 --> 01:13.352
- Major in Korean Literature
- You must have read it

01:14.352 --> 01:15.483
What's wrong?

01:15.653 --> 01:17.522
I got a call from the principal

01:17.593 --> 01:20.222
I couldn’t make an appointment to meet with teacher Li Zhouying.

01:20.423 --> 01:22.563
That's definitely what I know.

01:24.933 --> 01:28.703
That day I
chose her at first sight

01:30.403 --> 01:33.102
as my beautiful first death

01:33.673 --> 01:36.343
Will that girl die?

01:36.602 --> 01:37.912
how do you know?

01:38.412 --> 01:40.712
This is a case that has not happened yet

01:41.013 --> 01:43.242
Now how do we know this?

01:45.513 --> 01:49.153
(Part 5 – A Confession)

01:49.552 --> 01:51.122
what did you just say?

01:51.123 --> 01:52.293
Article (5)

01:53.123 --> 01:55.522
Isn't it a coincidence that we meet here ?

02:04.533 --> 02:06.233
if all this is true

02:07.272 --> 02:08.302
tonight

02:09.543 --> 02:11.873
Well, two days before that school teacher died

02:12.943 --> 02:15.112
He said there was a case where he suddenly disappeared

02:15.842 --> 02:18.013
Fortunately, I
was discovered by the villagers.

02:18.782 --> 02:20.913
Because I know I've lost my way

02:21.453 --> 02:23.522
Although it was just a small incident in the end,
in fact

02:24.893 --> 02:27.122
It seems like someone is being chased

02:34.962 --> 02:36.332
where was found

02:37.432 --> 02:38.703
Do you know where it is?

02:40.432 --> 02:41.473
River bank

02:42.073 --> 02:44.973
If it's close to a grocery store,
it should be around here

02:47.443 --> 02:48.443
Well

02:55.152 --> 02:56.182
Li Zhuying

03:00.693 --> 03:03.362
-Teacher-
No, I'm not

04:30.412 --> 04:31.412
ha

04:39.652 --> 04:40.992
What's your job?

04:40.993 --> 04:42.422
Are you half crazy and want to die?

04:45.863 --> 04:47.933
It’s Teacher Yin Hyejun again, is it you?

04:49.303 --> 04:50.332
ha

04:51.102 --> 04:52.803
Destroying it once is not enough

04:52.972 --> 04:55.303
Do you want to destroy it two or three times again and again?

05:11.722 --> 05:13.152
Gominsu was released, right?

05:14.292 --> 05:15.292
Why?

05:17.722 --> 05:19.792
Just followed the order

05:22.503 --> 05:24.232
Very responsible words

05:25.532 --> 05:27.373
Because doing work this way

05:34.373 --> 05:35.883
This is a one-time error

05:36.342 --> 05:39.013
Now you have to accept this,
Badang Badan

05:39.553 --> 05:41.082
if we are unlucky

05:41.623 --> 05:43.351
Because of the person you released today

05:43.352 --> 05:45.753
Someone's life
may be in danger again

05:49.393 --> 05:50.522
Are you fat now?

05:51.393 --> 05:52.731
It's just that guy again

05:52.732 --> 05:54.162
What did that guy do?

05:54.902 --> 05:57.232
You have nothing to say,
right?

05:58.532 --> 06:01.172
I know for a fact that letting him go was the worst idea

06:01.643 --> 06:03.303
Be sure to answer the question

06:04.102 --> 06:06.243
- Gominsu Is it hot now?
- I have no idea

06:07.412 --> 06:08.442
i don't know what

06:08.443 --> 06:11.042
Who can do what?

06:11.282 --> 06:12.752
Although you will know if you are caught

06:12.753 --> 06:14.922
Because alone,
I don’t know anything anymore

06:16.782 --> 06:17.782
if you knew anyway

06:17.783 --> 06:20.222
Although I don't want to share the responsibility of the police at all

06:22.422 --> 06:26.162
So please let
us not face each other again

06:36.602 --> 06:37.643
road..

06:39.443 --> 06:41.113
Did it just disappear?

06:41.743 --> 06:43.082
I am..

06:44.042 --> 06:45.652
Because I can't see much at night

06:47.082 --> 06:48.552
Too afraid of freedom

06:48.553 --> 06:50.152
Free is not paranoid

06:51.823 --> 06:53.123
anyone there?

06:54.592 --> 06:55.962
Even ran away

06:57.123 --> 07:00.792
I can't say I don't know anyone

07:00.962 --> 07:04.263
Is the stranger’s reaction
calm?

07:10.443 --> 07:11.613
Do not you remember?

07:12.172 --> 07:14.172
Regardless of whether
I said it myself or not

07:14.272 --> 07:16.943
-Teacher-
No, I'm not

07:19.212 --> 07:20.613
why not?

07:20.813 --> 07:23.022
Does anyone blame Mrs. Li
?

07:23.253 --> 07:24.453
The guy who ran away?

07:24.893 --> 07:26.522
Do you know who that is?

07:27.993 --> 07:30.323
I do not know what to say

07:34.263 --> 07:35.433
Ms. Li Zhuying

07:36.602 --> 07:38.272
Although I know it's hard to believe

07:38.732 --> 07:40.503
I'm trying to help Ms. Li now

07:41.133 --> 07:43.102
telling the truth can stop it

07:44.243 --> 07:46.041
threatened by someone

07:46.042 --> 07:47.042
no matter what

07:47.712 --> 07:48.982
everything must be said

07:58.893 --> 08:00.993
-Lee Joo
-young- Worry

08:03.123 --> 08:04.763
But thank you for your concern

08:07.662 --> 08:09.063
Really misunderstood

08:10.133 --> 08:11.703
I'm treated like a human being

08:13.972 --> 08:15.542
no threat

08:17.443 --> 08:19.612
Relatives and elders will be worried

08:19.613 --> 08:21.482
Mr. Yin, can I come back?

08:22.113 --> 08:23.183
Wait a moment

08:24.542 --> 08:26.912
Come back for now

08:28.383 --> 08:29.823
Yun Yang, let’s go too

08:30.753 --> 08:32.123
Then see you at school tomorrow

08:37.723 --> 08:39.062
Stay safe now..

08:39.233 --> 08:40.932
Can I buy you your favorite bread and feed it to you?

08:44.932 --> 08:46.672
What are bread skewers?

08:54.983 --> 08:57.082
When you look at it, it's obvious that something is hidden

08:57.083 --> 08:58.613
Is it because of this release?

08:59.952 --> 09:01.181
If that person is two days older than that person

09:01.182 --> 09:03.723
I don't think he knew what was going to happen.

09:05.452 --> 09:07.093
Is this the home court?

09:12.493 --> 09:14.031
(Tung Wah Tailor Shop)

09:14.032 --> 09:16.233
(in front of the inn)

09:19.772 --> 09:22.843
(in front of the inn)

09:27.042 --> 09:30.483
(Wujiang Hotel)

09:33.513 --> 09:36.223
(hostel)

09:37.682 --> 09:39.723
Are you here to see Beijin come back?

09:41.692 --> 09:43.562
I'm afraid there will be more questions that I don't know about

09:45.993 --> 09:47.093
Is it possible?

09:48.633 --> 09:51.263
For all I know, tonight
probably won't happen again

09:52.233 --> 09:53.902
I don't know if this is the right answer

09:55.902 --> 09:58.843
Because I don't know what you know and what you don't know

10:01.213 --> 10:02.513
That side might be the same

10:04.383 --> 10:05.952
From now on we will learn about

10:08.123 --> 10:10.983
Let's go to
the right place to talk

10:17.623 --> 10:20.291
(Bangbang Teahouse)

10:20.292 --> 10:22.003
The race tilts slightly to the right

10:23.162 --> 10:24.263
tilt in this direction

10:24.603 --> 10:26.071
- Teacher, look
- Gin Clan leans to the left

10:26.072 --> 10:30.602
(Bangbang Teahouse)

10:30.603 --> 10:31.713
Zuo Zuo

10:32.272 --> 10:33.842
left

10:33.843 --> 10:36.412
Last summer,
he was struck down by lightning

10:37.483 --> 10:38.952
If you view the fix now

10:39.152 --> 10:42.782
It's obvious that the owner
doesn't care about the extent of his responsibility

10:43.182 --> 10:45.723
This is not a teahouse

10:45.993 --> 10:47.692
You may already be familiar with this name

10:49.263 --> 10:51.792
This is the birthplace of useless matchsticks

10:52.532 --> 10:53.633
I got it

10:54.093 --> 10:56.103
(Bangbang Teahouse)

10:56.963 --> 10:58.103
let's go now

11:02.302 --> 11:05.071
(Bangbang Teahouse)

11:05.072 --> 11:07.613
(Bangbang Teahouse)

11:25.093 --> 11:28.402
(Bangbang Teahouse)

11:45.152 --> 11:47.853
I don't know if you already know, but this place

11:48.483 --> 11:51.522
In 1987,
a serial murder case occurred in Wujiang

11:52.692 --> 11:55.022
You may have guessed it, but
I'm following this case

11:57.022 --> 11:58.093
Did the detective do it?

12:02.932 --> 12:06.301
If you turn on the news, whether it's a weekend night or not

12:06.302 --> 12:08.172
i think i remember

12:10.542 --> 12:12.542
A criminal?

12:13.613 --> 12:16.312
The person who showed the photo to Ekan's reporter ?

12:17.083 --> 12:19.353
Wouldn't it be more logical to assume he was a news anchor ?

12:19.753 --> 12:21.353
Oh, like this

12:23.552 --> 12:25.353
Nine people in the TV series

12:25.792 --> 12:27.993
Sorry for not watching the news much

12:29.993 --> 12:32.733
Do you miss me too?

12:32.963 --> 12:35.833
No, it's not like that

12:36.263 --> 12:37.763
I thought about all kinds of things

12:38.302 --> 12:42.373
Even if I'm stuck in life, I want to be safe

12:44.503 --> 12:47.513
To get news?

12:49.243 --> 12:52.213
Roughly speaking, it is like this

12:57.052 --> 13:00.052
When will the case be heard?

13:05.692 --> 13:08.133
Two days later, on the 14th

13:08.532 --> 13:10.031
Two days later on the 16th

13:10.032 --> 13:11.062
another case

13:11.902 --> 13:13.932
A total of two girls
died

13:15.003 --> 13:17.343
- No. 20..
- One of them is missing

13:18.843 --> 13:20.171
I left a message

13:20.172 --> 13:21.272
Although I thought I ran away from home

13:22.113 --> 13:23.213
actually dead

13:24.583 --> 13:26.113
What do you say now?

13:27.483 --> 13:28.552
because he is dead

13:29.723 --> 13:32.493
There are three victims in total

13:37.363 --> 13:39.233
During more than thirty years

13:39.792 --> 13:42.932
No clues were found, let alone a body.

13:43.733 --> 13:45.531
Neither the police nor the victim’s family knew anything about it.

13:45.532 --> 13:46.733
How do you...

13:48.542 --> 13:51.072
It's hard to believe but I'm here

13:53.013 --> 13:55.042
I tell you as written here

14:00.353 --> 14:02.781
(people I killed)

14:02.782 --> 14:03.883
Please wait

14:06.052 --> 14:07.192
Wuwei wrote

14:09.863 --> 14:12.492
Madam, the article I wrote this time

14:12.493 --> 14:14.032
Can't you give me a little taste?

14:17.763 --> 14:19.003
Can we say a confession?

14:19.833 --> 14:20.902
frank?

14:22.672 --> 14:23.843
thirty years ago

14:24.902 --> 14:27.472
The perfect crime someone committed

14:27.473 --> 14:30.013
The person who starts the story is the protagonist

14:30.812 --> 14:33.583
Spend the rest of my life learning it alone

14:35.083 --> 14:36.123
Is it a pity?

14:39.093 --> 14:41.551
So thirty years ago

14:41.552 --> 14:43.762
I think it's about the same time as this novel.

14:43.763 --> 14:44.792
(small door)

14:45.863 --> 14:47.792
This time let’s talk about myself seriously.

14:50.733 --> 14:52.603
just kidding

14:53.032 --> 14:54.733
It's all written there

14:55.442 --> 14:56.802
certainly

14:57.103 --> 14:58.613
The teacher is really

15:03.113 --> 15:04.842
I've been a teacher for a long time

15:04.843 --> 15:06.483
Editor

15:08.113 --> 15:09.182
National American Award?

15:13.922 --> 15:17.093
Thanks to this,
Wu Guang’s new novel has not yet been published

15:17.292 --> 15:18.932
i can hold

15:20.263 --> 15:22.902
Even though I completely forgot about it after I got here

15:23.633 --> 15:26.103
After seeing that teacher just now

15:26.272 --> 15:28.442
Like seeing something weird every now and then

15:29.473 --> 15:30.772
I read it again

15:31.672 --> 15:33.572
Same as the content in the novel

15:35.812 --> 15:39.052
I don't think this is about what really happened.

15:40.353 --> 15:42.022
Anyway, that’s how it’s written

15:42.922 --> 15:44.353
Start with that school teacher

15:45.522 --> 15:46.922
three girls died

15:47.853 --> 15:50.192
I didn't find the real culprit until the end

15:51.562 --> 15:53.032
This is about the real culprit, right?

15:53.863 --> 15:55.932
Last paragraph of second page,
last line

15:56.263 --> 15:57.333
please confirm

16:23.322 --> 16:25.733
"The truth
was never revealed."

16:26.763 --> 16:28.902
"He created all this death."

16:29.162 --> 16:30.503
I am who I am

16:31.463 --> 16:34.302
Even that fun fact

17:03.633 --> 17:05.633
you are no longer in this house

17:09.702 --> 17:10.873
really good

17:35.932 --> 17:37.202
(people I killed)

17:37.902 --> 17:39.633
Is it really five lights?

17:45.073 --> 17:48.543
In fact, I didn't find the real culprit

17:49.083 --> 17:50.242
I'm surprised

17:51.712 --> 17:53.211
Although the defendant ultimately refused

17:53.212 --> 17:54.982
reality is unknowable

17:56.182 --> 17:59.492
Yes, that's why I talk like this

18:00.593 --> 18:02.722
The first time I stole it from my mother

18:03.063 --> 18:05.793
it's really about him

18:07.093 --> 18:10.133
If so, this may be new evidence

18:11.863 --> 18:13.232
can't say for sure

18:13.902 --> 18:15.402
Anyway, this is a novel

18:15.873 --> 18:17.941
Even though it's based on a true story

18:17.942 --> 18:20.043
However, imagination
can be very wild

18:21.273 --> 18:22.313
I started this week...

18:23.012 --> 18:26.012
We cannot guarantee that this is a true representation of the Gowe Awards

18:26.452 --> 18:27.883
I can't guarantee there won't be

18:29.952 --> 18:30.982
Did you just see that?

18:31.422 --> 18:33.922
I also wrote about
the whereabouts of the missing teacher

18:36.992 --> 18:38.992
someone who knows more than you

18:40.133 --> 18:41.363
Isn't this the culprit?

18:43.502 --> 18:45.033
Because they are from the same village

18:45.833 --> 18:48.533
You can write down
what you saw and heard at that time

18:49.002 --> 18:50.971
How many have I tried

18:50.972 --> 18:53.373
Most are just official records

18:53.613 --> 18:55.383
Why do you
deny it?

18:55.912 --> 18:58.143
Why do you make such clear accusations?

19:05.893 --> 19:07.893
Do you want Wu Mei to be the culprit?

19:10.563 --> 19:12.292
Why so much knowledge...

19:12.293 --> 19:13.732
That's why I doubt

19:15.962 --> 19:17.303
Five lights, I know

19:18.363 --> 19:20.232
Because he is fully capable of doing so

19:25.103 --> 19:26.712
What do you say now?

19:30.283 --> 19:32.182
Are you talking about marrying me now?

19:33.652 --> 19:36.053
pastor when

19:37.853 --> 19:39.922
What happened again?

19:40.222 --> 19:41.652
What will you marry?

19:42.523 --> 19:43.922
we are not together yet

19:44.123 --> 19:45.592
That guy who doesn't even taste like milk

19:45.593 --> 19:47.633
This is why I made mistakes early on

19:48.063 --> 19:50.001
When will you actually be called out?

19:50.002 --> 19:51.032
-This time-
Yin Ying

19:51.033 --> 19:52.273
How is the child doing?

19:53.103 --> 19:55.772
Am I really going crazy because what did I do wrong?

19:55.773 --> 19:57.902
- I've never said anything like that
- Ma'am.

19:58.043 --> 20:00.211
A son and a daughter will be born and
they will live well

20:00.212 --> 20:01.273
a son and a daughter

20:02.083 --> 20:03.242
- Sun Al
- How's it going?

20:03.942 --> 20:06.652
Is there something wrong with your ears?

20:07.353 --> 20:08.981
When did I
say they would leave?

20:08.982 --> 20:10.452
I just said I wanted to stay

20:10.952 --> 20:13.692
I asked what the dream was.

20:15.863 --> 20:18.023
I also want to have a family

20:19.393 --> 20:22.633
Sorry, I already have a partner

20:22.962 --> 20:24.501
That’s why I can’t accept Hisoka’s heart

20:24.502 --> 20:25.732
- what is
- what is

20:28.033 --> 20:30.202
Even if not, there will be a time when I
can meet in front of you

20:30.742 --> 20:31.972
Hey

20:43.982 --> 20:45.422
It's really that person

20:46.523 --> 20:47.692
Sun Ai's boyfriend?

20:54.333 --> 20:55.662
first love

21:02.643 --> 21:05.002
Indeed, I came to speak

21:05.242 --> 21:06.242
That's it

21:15.012 --> 21:17.452
i hate flowers

21:18.853 --> 21:19.992
keep great

21:26.293 --> 21:27.661
(Bom Bom Theater)

21:27.662 --> 21:28.662
Sun E

21:30.402 --> 21:31.462
Sun E

21:37.502 --> 21:40.512
I guess I should explain what I just saw

21:44.383 --> 21:46.553
Need to explain slowly

21:48.053 --> 21:49.123
Unless it's not...

21:50.623 --> 21:51.783
family?

21:55.023 --> 21:57.093
I have a son
and a daughter

21:58.063 --> 22:01.033
I think this is my daughter's place

22:02.932 --> 22:06.432
Are you the daughter of suspect Bays?

22:26.793 --> 22:27.853
bamboo

22:28.922 --> 22:30.261
I'm scared

22:30.262 --> 22:31.593
(hostel)

22:34.262 --> 22:35.533
How to call the police?

22:38.762 --> 22:40.803
Nothing to do with the police

22:46.073 --> 22:47.972
I don't think I can stay here too long

22:52.682 --> 22:53.752
Excellent

22:59.652 --> 23:01.722
Who really knows me?

23:07.633 --> 23:08.732
Ok, I know

23:18.502 --> 23:22.343
(Someone is watching you)

23:29.982 --> 23:31.422
Are you too confused?

23:34.323 --> 23:35.722
I was really shocked

23:36.462 --> 23:39.662
It's hard to believe it's been thirty years since I was hit by a car

23:39.833 --> 23:41.833
The person who hits someone is a time traveler

23:41.992 --> 23:44.633
In front of that man’s house, my mother’s family
was all seated

23:45.563 --> 23:46.603
bamboo

23:47.633 --> 23:49.172
Why do you really want to go to school?

23:50.242 --> 23:51.242
No

23:52.073 --> 23:54.242
Why did you do that in the teahouse
?

23:57.583 --> 23:59.283
it's a bit complicated

24:04.682 --> 24:07.422
To separate my parents in the teahouse

24:08.422 --> 24:09.523
What will be divided?

24:10.462 --> 24:14.393
Don't let mom and dad see each other

24:15.633 --> 24:16.863
from the sun...

24:18.533 --> 24:21.201
- Acres?
- What?

24:21.202 --> 24:23.702
Yes, everything is accidental

24:23.803 --> 24:26.613
I remember getting hit by a car without thinking twice.

24:27.012 --> 24:29.283
Stay in front of young parents

24:29.883 --> 24:32.212
Should I consider separating the two?

24:33.212 --> 24:35.613
Have you never thought about the consequences of this?

24:36.222 --> 24:38.682
- You can't come...
- What's the matter?

24:41.992 --> 24:42.992
what happened

24:45.192 --> 24:46.593
What happened to those little guys?

24:51.333 --> 24:53.033
Do I know nothing about this?

24:56.543 --> 24:59.741
One small action
can change someone's entire future

24:59.742 --> 25:01.742
Did you tell me when you first came here ?

25:04.742 --> 25:06.283
So what is it?

25:10.982 --> 25:12.323
before coming here

25:14.222 --> 25:16.762
I asked him what he was doing by the river

25:17.222 --> 25:18.662
(police)

25:19.593 --> 25:20.932
That day at the river

25:22.133 --> 25:23.962
Mother abandoned us
and left

25:27.633 --> 25:29.273
no right to resent

25:30.343 --> 25:32.273
I abandoned my mother first

25:33.212 --> 25:34.672
because we don't know

25:36.412 --> 25:39.182
I gave crazy love that I can't repay

25:40.853 --> 25:42.211
(Suen Er)

25:42.212 --> 25:44.822
It's becoming a name that's crazy to ignore

25:44.823 --> 25:45.992
(Suen Er)

25:47.623 --> 25:48.823
one day suddenly

25:49.922 --> 25:51.823
I don’t know if my mother understands

25:53.432 --> 25:56.202
There are too many moments that I can't look back on

25:56.863 --> 25:59.902
it's too late

26:01.803 --> 26:04.073
That day, by the river,
I had a strong desire

26:05.373 --> 26:07.672
If there is only one chance

26:10.182 --> 26:14.113
It would be nice if I could
look back for a moment

26:18.922 --> 26:20.793
I don't know if I look crazy

26:24.063 --> 26:26.563
But actually,
no matter what I do

26:29.103 --> 26:31.062
Until my mother went to the river

26:31.063 --> 26:33.533
If I think there's nothing I can do,
I...

26:36.402 --> 26:38.472
I don't think I can bear it anyway

26:52.422 --> 26:55.152
Sorry, I didn't mean to say that

26:55.252 --> 26:56.363
Come in

26:57.123 --> 26:59.063
Just listen to it today

27:04.633 --> 27:05.702
Excellent

28:12.303 --> 28:13.833
I have to ask this

28:33.623 --> 28:35.623
Unless it's not

28:37.123 --> 28:38.393
That day at the river

28:39.732 --> 28:41.432
Mother abandoned us
and left

(Bangbang Teahouse)

28:50.043 --> 28:51.072
(Bangbang Teahouse)

28:51.073 --> 28:53.872
I don't think I picked this up

28:53.873 --> 28:55.773
(Women who study are more dangerous)

28:56.712 --> 28:58.043
Really when and where?

28:58.643 --> 29:01.012
I stumbled upon this floating village on the banks of a river

29:02.412 --> 29:04.083
pick it up without thinking

29:05.853 --> 29:07.823
Why?

29:19.773 --> 29:21.103
( Suspect in Wu Jong-il serial murder case )

30:00.212 --> 30:02.273
(Bangbang Teahouse)

30:16.823 --> 30:18.123
Where did it come from?

30:19.293 --> 30:20.662
(Bangbang Teahouse)

30:22.133 --> 30:23.633
There's something you need to know

30:27.333 --> 30:30.972
(Wuzhengli Fishing Ground)

30:31.972 --> 30:34.373
Because of what I said yesterday

30:35.543 --> 30:36.712
Don't worry

30:38.143 --> 30:40.053
This is my personal matter

30:40.982 --> 30:42.783
Don't interfere with the work there

30:46.722 --> 30:48.192
For me, my mother is...

30:49.323 --> 30:50.893
This is not a serious problem

30:52.162 --> 30:54.633
He gave birth to me but never looked up

30:55.033 --> 30:57.202
Because the one who ran away was my mother

30:58.563 --> 31:01.502
I don't quite understand how my mother feels

31:02.972 --> 31:06.241
As others have said,
is there anything special and hurtful about it?

31:06.242 --> 31:07.442
i don't even know

31:08.113 --> 31:09.682
I never knew or didn't want to know

31:11.113 --> 31:12.512
But no matter who

31:13.912 --> 31:16.952
I know the one I love has no reason,
I don't know what it feels like

31:24.123 --> 31:26.832
i don't care what happens

31:26.833 --> 31:28.393
The heart that misses my mother

31:29.192 --> 31:31.462
Do you think your mother is not sensible enough?

31:34.972 --> 31:36.032
what does that mean..

31:36.033 --> 31:38.303
Knowing this, would you still make such a choice?

31:40.543 --> 31:42.712
- What do you want to say now?
- Listen carefully.

31:44.043 --> 31:46.553
First murder tomorrow night

31:47.212 --> 31:48.982
You know stuff will come out

31:58.162 --> 31:59.293
matchbox

32:09.942 --> 32:11.472
and the memorandum therein

32:15.043 --> 32:17.012
(Women who study are more dangerous)

32:18.883 --> 32:19.911
this..

32:19.912 --> 32:21.882
At that time, the police deliberately left the matter to the defendant

32:21.883 --> 32:23.283
They considered this mark

32:25.123 --> 32:26.522
Among the second victim’s belongings

32:26.523 --> 32:28.152
Because the same product comes out

32:29.252 --> 32:30.323
Is that the mark?

32:34.093 --> 32:35.363
So why is this...

32:36.232 --> 32:38.902
Why did the defendant use material from 34 years ago...

32:40.073 --> 32:42.633
Will we meet again in 2021?

32:44.303 --> 32:45.472
This is a popular store

32:46.613 --> 32:49.883
Why on the bank of the river where your mother died?

32:53.652 --> 32:54.712
Unless it's not...

32:56.682 --> 32:57.823
no definite evidence

32:58.482 --> 33:01.692
Yes, your feelings are genuine

33:02.422 --> 33:04.522
Maybe your mother doesn't know

33:04.523 --> 33:06.093
but if

33:07.833 --> 33:08.932
if it's true

33:17.873 --> 33:20.043
That day, by the river, your mother...

33:20.643 --> 33:22.472
if you meet someone else

33:23.083 --> 33:25.313
That was 34 years ago

33:25.512 --> 33:27.053
If the real culprit

33:30.783 --> 33:32.783
So now you've made a mistake

33:33.853 --> 33:36.793
Do you hate yourself
for giving up?

33:38.162 --> 33:39.762

33:41.992 --> 33:43.033
do not you?

Yun Yang

34:23.202 --> 34:24.643
Were you too scared yesterday?

34:25.543 --> 34:26.543
sorry

34:27.673 --> 34:29.881
I lied to you on purpose

34:29.882 --> 34:32.952
Basisu,
it’s not just to meet that person.

34:36.983 --> 34:37.983
Yes

34:38.923 --> 34:40.492
Why did you miss this?

34:41.452 --> 34:43.423
Until she becomes a gray-haired grandma

34:43.822 --> 34:46.632
I want to play with Yoongi forever

34:47.162 --> 34:48.833
dear mother

34:49.463 --> 34:51.162
This is a letter, not a will

34:52.833 --> 34:54.602
I will always be by your side

34:54.603 --> 34:56.443
My mom is always like this. .

34:57.673 --> 34:59.103
I just promised

35:01.612 --> 35:04.313
How could it be misunderstood like this?

35:05.213 --> 35:06.452
how so..

35:08.282 --> 35:11.083
Don't you understand in the end?

35:11.653 --> 35:12.722
Yun Yang

35:14.592 --> 35:16.362
Is that disappointment?

35:20.492 --> 35:21.563
sorry

35:25.833 --> 35:27.531
What is always so painful?

35:27.532 --> 35:28.632
I do not understand

35:29.173 --> 35:31.802
No,
I really don't know either

35:33.173 --> 35:35.642
It was written on a piece of paper taken from a matchbox

35:35.643 --> 35:36.943
They will have a common encounter

35:45.322 --> 35:46.393
Don't worry

35:48.393 --> 35:49.393
more..

35:51.822 --> 35:52.991
Another such tragedy

35:52.992 --> 35:54.563
I will protect it from happening

35:55.662 --> 35:57.403
I will protect you no matter what

35:58.862 --> 36:00.572
But thanks anyway

36:01.273 --> 36:04.072
Is it that bad?

36:05.003 --> 36:07.773
Can't we have a cold drink together?

36:08.713 --> 36:12.112
I didn't marry Fan Feng

36:20.322 --> 36:23.193
Genlai, what are they doing?

36:24.523 --> 36:25.523
I have no idea

36:26.222 --> 36:29.132
I heard that the level was released,
has Sun E's level dropped a lot?

36:41.112 --> 36:42.842
- Thank you
- Yes, do your job

36:43.443 --> 36:44.612
- Teacher Che-
Yes

36:45.512 --> 36:46.781
Take it and eat it

36:46.782 --> 36:47.952
- I'll eat well.
- Okay.

36:49.313 --> 36:50.781
- Yes
, this is...

36:50.782 --> 36:53.122
- Yes
- Our son sent it from the United States.

36:53.123 --> 36:54.353
Oh America?

36:54.423 --> 36:56.122
Doesn't it look great?

36:56.123 --> 36:57.162
- This is...
- Ha

36:57.623 --> 37:00.631
I don’t know if it’s American,
but something seems wrong.

37:00.632 --> 37:02.761
- Did you notice?
- Thanks

37:02.762 --> 37:05.103
So now you've made a mistake

37:06.162 --> 37:09.032
Did you hate yourself and
give up?

37:13.572 --> 37:15.142
Mother

37:15.143 --> 37:17.881
good mom

37:17.882 --> 37:19.781
No need to say it so strongly

37:19.782 --> 37:22.882
I need to say something sweet.

37:23.483 --> 37:25.451
- Yes
- Indeed, this country is huge

37:25.452 --> 37:27.923
The country is big and
the flowers are also big

37:28.052 --> 37:30.122
- The leaves are also big, very good
- Yes

37:30.123 --> 37:32.362
- Hello
- Yes, are you here?

37:33.393 --> 37:35.532
I think so

37:37.262 --> 37:38.701
It's time to throw this away

37:38.702 --> 37:40.132
Why throw it away?

37:40.603 --> 37:43.003
Teacher Li Zhouying is here

37:43.673 --> 37:46.102
14 hours flight to South Korea

37:46.103 --> 37:48.612
Come on, cause I'll give you precious jelly

37:48.912 --> 37:49.912
Yes

37:51.842 --> 37:54.012
I didn't tell anyone about last night

37:58.382 --> 38:00.322
Go get it for me

38:01.952 --> 38:02.992
gentlemen

38:04.623 --> 38:06.123
Jelly from America

38:09.733 --> 38:10.733
i will bring it

38:12.932 --> 38:14.072
Thanks

38:16.373 --> 38:17.841
- Is it sweet?
- come from America

38:17.842 --> 38:19.543
come on now

38:19.773 --> 38:22.173
- try this
- thanks

38:23.782 --> 38:25.841
- I'm depressed
- I'm still the same

38:25.842 --> 38:28.082
- I think I'm going to get fat
- Am I a bitch?

38:28.083 --> 38:29.083
I answered a lot

38:29.084 --> 38:30.182
(Intermediate
Lee Sun El, advanced class Gomizu)

38:31.583 --> 38:32.882
- I can't believe it
- I guess

38:32.983 --> 38:34.023
step 1

38:34.552 --> 38:36.193
- Level 1
- His level is the same as before

38:36.353 --> 38:37.522
I'm going back to class

38:37.523 --> 38:39.092
- That's great.
- Ma'am.

38:39.162 --> 38:40.193
divine water

38:41.492 --> 38:43.503
Is this enough?

38:43.963 --> 38:46.603
I am proud of you

38:48.173 --> 38:49.503
How to get level?

38:51.273 --> 38:54.213
- School-wide level 1
- Ms.

38:55.443 --> 38:56.682
The whole school is Level 1

38:57.813 --> 38:59.083
- Step 1
- Bamboo

39:00.182 --> 39:01.412
- We are upgrading
hahaha

39:15.032 --> 39:16.262
First level in the school

39:17.103 --> 39:18.103
I guessed most of it

39:18.104 --> 39:19.261
hehe

39:19.262 --> 39:20.403
Is it level one?

39:25.673 --> 39:26.813
I will be sad

39:28.143 --> 39:30.782
I'm very proud

39:33.253 --> 39:34.782
Really?

39:38.983 --> 39:42.693
Can you live with sad bad people?

39:47.733 --> 39:48.833
he came out

39:59.443 --> 40:02.173
Pretend you can't pass the exam

40:03.213 --> 40:06.313
Lee Seung-il always behaves like this

40:07.083 --> 40:08.112
Are you that happy?

40:08.612 --> 40:10.181
Everyone can see it on the forehead

40:10.182 --> 40:11.221
Should I post it?

40:11.222 --> 40:12.522
- Are you crazy?
- Yin Ying

40:12.523 --> 40:13.952
This crazy Kim Hye Kyun

40:16.452 --> 40:19.193
- Hey, you're in trouble.
- Come on.

40:22.463 --> 40:23.563
Qingxian

40:24.903 --> 40:25.932
Won't you come back soon?

40:26.903 --> 40:28.031
- I hate it
- I'm disappointed

40:28.032 --> 40:29.572
- how is he?
- cool

40:31.173 --> 40:32.202
- let's go
- very disappointed

40:36.173 --> 40:38.313
bring back

40:43.583 --> 40:47.023
(school rules)

40:47.423 --> 40:48.893
This school is weird

40:50.293 --> 40:51.893
it only sticks to the sides

41:03.373 --> 41:05.242
Do you like such a man?

41:07.273 --> 41:09.012
What do you really like to watch?

41:11.242 --> 41:17.482
(College Entrance Examination Part 1)

41:17.483 --> 41:20.123
This mathematical description can be used like this

41:21.793 --> 41:22.892
Interesting

41:22.893 --> 41:25.293
The whole school is suspicious

41:25.722 --> 41:27.762
Please be conscious

41:28.693 --> 41:29.862
Mother

41:31.032 --> 41:33.063
He is indeed a poor man

41:34.932 --> 41:37.143
How is it going?

41:48.052 --> 41:49.112
nothing

41:50.123 --> 41:51.123
very good

41:52.952 --> 41:54.653
I don't want to lose my friendship

41:56.793 --> 41:57.862
Unless it's not...

41:59.523 --> 42:00.932
Did something go wrong yesterday?

42:01.492 --> 42:03.132
Even the flowers I gave you don’t work?

42:07.103 --> 42:08.432
what is that?

42:09.932 --> 42:12.342
Why go through the trouble of
choosing one yourself?

42:13.742 --> 42:15.342
The one I bought is more beautiful

42:16.012 --> 42:17.782
indeed

42:19.742 --> 42:20.882
take it

42:22.313 --> 42:26.282
Girls
don't like it very much because it's naive

42:30.293 --> 42:31.492
is that so?

42:32.762 --> 42:33.963
so

42:34.132 --> 42:35.261
Who will open it?

42:35.262 --> 42:36.293
Are you really not going to tell me?

42:39.063 --> 42:40.632
Hey, that's it...

42:40.932 --> 42:43.802
I'll tell you if I can

42:44.943 --> 42:46.472
I know, try it

42:46.643 --> 42:47.713
Thanks

42:49.213 --> 42:51.182
- Tried it with Su Shui
- Yeah

42:52.443 --> 42:53.983
He said it was a flower

42:55.353 --> 42:57.253
Your ho...what?

43:02.123 --> 43:03.693
Do girls like it?

43:04.592 --> 43:06.023
I'm sure

43:06.563 --> 43:08.362
Although he says he doesn't always like it

43:08.463 --> 43:10.202
This is what it means to like

43:10.362 --> 43:11.962
pretend to be shy

43:11.963 --> 43:14.833
If you don’t like it, you just don’t like it.
Why do you feel ashamed?

43:17.643 --> 43:20.173
Hey, so just give me a flower

43:21.012 --> 43:23.782
Give me a flower,
where is the rest?

43:23.943 --> 43:26.112
Oh, is that right?

43:27.353 --> 43:28.552
Well, that too. .

43:30.123 --> 43:31.923
I use it in a good place

43:32.923 --> 43:34.153
Hello

44:25.302 --> 44:27.213
Why do you think this is not Gotsu?

44:30.282 --> 44:33.512
If this place is the culprit

44:33.713 --> 44:36.213
34 years later, another murder

44:36.853 --> 44:38.952
This is why my mother died

44:40.623 --> 44:43.722
I think the defendant may be more of a backlighter

44:43.793 --> 44:45.423
It's entirely possible

44:46.722 --> 44:47.862
but..

44:48.063 --> 44:50.562
The man who chased the school teacher and ran away last night

44:50.563 --> 44:51.563
Who is the one?

44:53.932 --> 44:56.373
I think this is the one I've been waiting for

44:58.103 --> 44:59.302
at the same time

44:59.603 --> 45:02.412
I thought there would be answers on Lee Joo Young's path and
waited

45:03.273 --> 45:05.643
Lee Joo Young’s route on the night he was killed

45:06.083 --> 45:07.781
(Let us move forward with freedom, creativity and wisdom)

45:07.782 --> 45:10.522
The person who got off work that night was Lee Joo-young

45:10.523 --> 45:12.353
I left school around ten o'clock

45:13.123 --> 45:16.591
(Wuzhong Middle School)

45:16.592 --> 45:18.592
(Bangbang Teahouse)

45:18.893 --> 45:20.362
destination..

45:20.733 --> 45:23.903
This is the Bom Bom teahouse we went to yesterday

45:35.643 --> 45:36.713
welcome

45:40.713 --> 45:44.052
There are twenty minutes and
half past ten

45:44.382 --> 45:45.853
Lee Joo Young is out

45:46.523 --> 45:49.653
The next destination
is definitely Wuzheng Inn

46:00.202 --> 46:03.702
But that night,
I couldn't go to Lee Joo Young's hotel

46:07.112 --> 46:08.543
(pay phone)

46:09.173 --> 46:11.882
(Wujiang Hotel)

46:14.682 --> 46:17.423
(Bangbang Teahouse)

46:20.893 --> 46:23.221
From teahouse to hotel
, even if it’s a step slower

46:23.222 --> 46:24.293
only thirty minutes

46:25.123 --> 46:27.293
Just disappeared in such a short distance

46:27.893 --> 46:29.963
Until he was found dead the next day

46:30.903 --> 46:34.003
Are there no witnesses within such a short distance
?

46:34.773 --> 46:37.943
No one saw who he met at the same time

46:38.572 --> 46:40.912
That's why I didn't watch it myself

46:42.643 --> 46:44.443
Same time and same place

46:45.112 --> 46:46.483
towards one direction

46:46.882 --> 46:48.782
Because I will stand behind Lee Joo Young

46:49.552 --> 46:52.623
So maybe we'll see the
man in the blue hat again

46:53.322 --> 46:54.393
Blue hat?

46:54.923 --> 46:57.293
Lee Joo Young’s 20 Minutes in the Teahouse

46:57.992 --> 46:59.722
He was the only person I met there

47:07.903 --> 47:09.932
(Bangbang Teahouse)

47:13.373 --> 47:14.943
Is this an argument?

47:16.313 --> 47:18.643
Although he is a very suspicious person

47:19.342 --> 47:22.083
At that time, the police were unable to fully investigate who it was.

47:23.253 --> 47:26.983
But the guy I chased last night
was wearing a blue hat

47:34.132 --> 47:36.532
The National American Awards have not been completely cancelled.

47:37.162 --> 47:39.063
will be fully considered and monitored

47:39.762 --> 47:40.802
but..

47:42.072 --> 47:43.503
As for Gomisu, I still need it

47:46.043 --> 47:49.112
I'll catch Mion carefully here

47:50.173 --> 47:53.753
1987 and 2021

47:54.382 --> 47:56.452
That man can't kill anyone

47:57.882 --> 47:59.353
Because I'm here to do this

48:02.193 --> 48:04.123
So please trust me and
wait

48:34.322 --> 48:40.893

48:43.762 --> 48:45.733
I'll come back to make sure it's safe

48:46.403 --> 48:47.531
Shall we go together?

48:47.532 --> 48:49.503
The work I have to do
is neither ordinary nor special.

48:50.373 --> 48:51.403
and then

48:54.713 --> 48:57.512
Don't go alone,
go with your mom and uncle

49:01.713 --> 49:02.983
(Cream Twisted Jelly)

49:04.123 --> 49:05.653
Let's go with Yoon Young

(Detective Division 1)

49:24.673 --> 49:25.903
misunderstanding

49:26.173 --> 49:29.213
I was not chased or threatened by anyone

49:30.173 --> 49:32.912
They must be hiding something

49:34.083 --> 49:35.983
Are you going to buy your favorite rolls?

49:36.753 --> 49:38.722
I know I'm following

49:39.253 --> 49:40.923
I let myself hear these words on purpose

49:43.123 --> 49:45.822
It seems to be telling the woman that she is in a dangerous situation

49:46.923 --> 49:47.963
Yes

49:48.193 --> 49:49.432
Brother, where are you going?

49:51.362 --> 49:53.202
- Not that bad
- So why eat them all?

49:53.702 --> 49:54.833
Hey badminton number eight

49:55.472 --> 49:57.272
Where are you going alone?

49:57.273 --> 49:59.702
(Wujiang Police Station)

50:01.842 --> 50:03.842
confirm

50:04.213 --> 50:05.912
Why not reconfirm?

50:05.983 --> 50:07.312
Like the hospital manager again, he broke the pot

50:07.313 --> 50:08.482
If you didn't bring it

50:08.483 --> 50:11.583
Please stop, eight hundred knees

50:11.983 --> 50:15.052
Yes,
there is a new teacher at Goi High School

50:15.222 --> 50:17.362
Things are a little weird, so
I'll be back

50:17.722 --> 50:18.722
Hey

50:21.051 --> 50:22.293
What's weird?

50:24.202 --> 50:26.103
Don’t you know who the eldest brother is?

50:28.173 --> 50:29.572
(in front of the inn)

50:43.213 --> 50:47.793
(Wuzhong Hotel)

50:56.592 --> 50:58.632
That school teacher
has three old crimes

51:00.932 --> 51:02.801
We just pretend not to know

51:02.802 --> 51:04.373
He said he was not an ordinary person

51:14.052 --> 51:15.253
Tonight

51:16.253 --> 51:18.752
If nothing else changes,
tonight

51:18.753 --> 51:20.382
Is it really not helpful?

51:21.653 --> 51:24.123
Since it's my business,
I can do anything

51:24.563 --> 51:26.222
Because I'm used to moving alone

51:37.003 --> 51:38.443
What if something changes?

51:39.373 --> 51:40.443
Go first

How is this going?

51:56.423 --> 51:57.762
- Hello
- Yeah

51:57.923 --> 51:59.463
-
Hello

52:22.612 --> 52:24.952
I asked what happened

52:25.583 --> 52:27.822
I'm talking about removing it

52:33.822 --> 52:36.462
Make sure you work hard for about a month

52:36.463 --> 52:37.662
The opportunity has been given

52:39.103 --> 52:41.233
Aren’t you here to help Li Zhouying?

52:44.673 --> 52:46.043
For such people, you have to help, right?

52:47.003 --> 52:48.072
I?

52:49.813 --> 52:50.912
Mr. Yin Haijun

52:51.382 --> 52:53.813
You might even die because of that woman

52:54.612 --> 52:55.682
do you know?

52:58.083 --> 53:00.382
Hey, let's go grab it,
don't miss it

53:00.653 --> 53:02.253
- Yes, let's go.
- Yes, let's go.

53:21.143 --> 53:22.213
ha

53:29.083 --> 53:30.112
leg

53:33.923 --> 53:35.393
Why so fast?

53:36.423 --> 53:37.762
tired

53:39.162 --> 53:41.431
If I really only paid 500,000 won,
I would ask a Korean lady to do it

53:41.432 --> 53:43.733
They said it belonged to my father

53:45.802 --> 53:46.833
strength..

53:47.472 --> 53:49.173
There will only be half a million

53:49.503 --> 53:52.002
Even if you give five million, it is absolutely impossible

53:52.003 --> 53:53.972
Korean wife, that little girl

53:54.912 --> 53:55.912
My daughter, what is going on?

53:56.373 --> 53:57.612
My daughter, what is going on?

53:58.282 --> 53:59.313
Father

54:00.112 --> 54:02.682
The daughter is Yu Zaili’s Genshun

54:02.912 --> 54:03.983
Is it the same now?

54:04.452 --> 54:05.523
what happened

54:13.162 --> 54:14.463
Even Chestnut smiled, poor child

54:14.532 --> 54:15.733
really annoyed

54:16.233 --> 54:17.732
- Mom
- I'm going to Seoul

54:17.733 --> 54:18.733
When is the fastest bus?

54:18.733 --> 54:19.733
I was shocked

54:20.503 --> 54:21.902
Will be there in five minutes

54:21.903 --> 54:23.632
- Give me a ticket.
- A ticket?

54:24.202 --> 54:25.302
Wait a moment

54:26.173 --> 54:27.643
- Ha
- let's see.

54:28.112 --> 54:29.212
Give it quickly

54:29.213 --> 54:31.511
Why are they all running around sweating ?

54:31.512 --> 54:32.583
What

54:34.952 --> 54:36.983
- Ha
- Wait a minute, teacher.

54:37.983 --> 54:39.322
arrest him

54:40.083 --> 54:42.122
Where does the otter come from to give the orders?

54:42.123 --> 54:44.892
- Ah Nuttle
- But I listen

54:44.893 --> 54:45.962
-let
go

54:45.963 --> 54:47.931
let it go

54:47.932 --> 54:49.192
-Miss
-Teacher

54:49.193 --> 54:50.392
- Let go
- just for a moment

54:50.393 --> 54:51.661
-Teacher, wait a minute
- let go

54:51.662 --> 54:52.662
please

54:55.273 --> 54:57.202
I don't know why I do this

54:58.373 --> 55:00.603
I have to stay here tonight

55:01.112 --> 55:02.543
Only then can you catch it

55:04.282 --> 55:05.313
It will be like this

55:09.612 --> 55:10.753
Korean teachers also came

55:14.592 --> 55:15.653
Mother

55:16.722 --> 55:18.193
Mother

55:20.862 --> 55:22.732
- You two
- Lee Joo Young

55:22.733 --> 55:25.132
Do you think I don't know you are watching me every night?

55:25.862 --> 55:27.702
That night he found me under the bridge

55:28.773 --> 55:30.003
Isn't it a coincidence?

55:30.802 --> 55:32.341
hand it over to the police

55:32.342 --> 55:34.042
It was planned from the beginning

55:34.043 --> 55:35.373
Now I misunderstood something

55:36.112 --> 55:38.043
Please calm down and
give me that knife

55:39.182 --> 55:40.443
i don't trust anyone

55:41.713 --> 55:43.312
dirty spy

55:43.313 --> 55:44.653
please believe my words

55:45.483 --> 55:46.552
us..

55:47.182 --> 55:48.923
I'm doing this to help Lee Joo Young

55:51.722 --> 55:52.793
What's the matter, ma'am?

55:57.262 --> 55:58.403
release

56:00.603 --> 56:02.132
please lee juyoung

56:05.603 --> 56:07.673
Please raise your voice because the police are coming

56:08.572 --> 56:10.882
Is there no place to hide, father?

56:11.842 --> 56:13.813
here, here, inside

56:14.112 --> 56:15.112
go in

56:31.833 --> 56:33.503
How are you?
No injuries?

56:34.233 --> 56:35.373
I am fine

56:36.373 --> 56:37.532
I am fine

56:38.342 --> 56:39.342
Yes

56:43.643 --> 56:44.682
i don't know how to speak

56:45.213 --> 56:48.213
The bus has left.
Who are you talking about?

56:49.813 --> 56:53.653
We here have been
talking about Miss Korea

56:56.492 --> 56:57.722
Hello

56:59.063 --> 57:01.592
You said it's impossible,
you bad guy

57:02.432 --> 57:05.802
The father said, my daughter is Oh Jae-ri Geun-soon

57:11.673 --> 57:12.702
Let’s check the accommodation again

57:12.943 --> 57:14.313
- Pastor Yes
- Yes, I know.

57:17.612 --> 57:20.483
- Ha
- A gift from my father, bad girl.

57:22.253 --> 57:23.253
Why..

57:31.623 --> 57:32.963
all because of me

57:33.523 --> 57:35.992
I misjudged
the changes

57:37.903 --> 57:41.903
In any case, it would be too risky to send him back to the inn tonight.

57:43.233 --> 57:46.043
Yes, take them to a safe place first

57:55.512 --> 57:57.653
I thought I was alone

58:00.952 --> 58:02.753
I'm scared

58:04.362 --> 58:05.463
sorry

58:06.662 --> 58:08.362
sorry

58:23.043 --> 58:25.112
Is it really okay to go alone?

58:25.543 --> 58:27.412
Just look at this face and I'll be back

58:29.253 --> 58:31.123
(Bom Bom Tea House Coffee and Tea)

58:54.242 --> 58:55.643
if you are lucky

58:57.012 --> 58:58.342
Even without Lee Joo Young

58:59.043 --> 59:00.611
at the same time and the same place

59:00.612 --> 59:02.612
I wonder if that person will come out

59:34.043 --> 59:35.382
if you are lucky

59:36.452 --> 59:37.452
that face

59:38.523 --> 59:39.782
Continue to confirm

59:40.523 --> 59:41.722
that person..

59:42.452 --> 59:45.722
Because 34 years later, I will be the one responsible for killing my mother.

01:01:09.813 --> 01:01:10.912
Going crazy

01:01:36.572 --> 01:01:39.373
(Women who study are more dangerous)

01:01:42.572 --> 01:01:44.472
"A Stranger I Met"

01:01:44.612 --> 01:01:46.212
one of the three suspects

01:01:46.213 --> 01:01:47.812
hidden blue hat

01:01:47.813 --> 01:01:49.411
Everything matches the action

01:01:49.412 --> 01:01:51.983
The most likely culprit is Bakhisu

01:01:52.483 --> 01:01:54.753
If the blue hats are the real culprits

01:01:54.793 --> 01:01:56.051
His mother...

01:01:56.052 --> 01:01:58.262
i killed my wife

01:01:58.393 --> 01:02:00.562
The blue hat is yours...

01:02:00.563 --> 01:02:03.131
I know,
I saw it with my own eyes

01:02:03.132 --> 01:02:05.661
Although I never thought of becoming such a person

01:02:05.662 --> 01:02:07.462
just be one of the skeptics

01:02:07.463 --> 01:02:10.273
Is the blue hat talking about my father now?

01:02:10.403 --> 01:02:11.443
what happened

01:02:16.072 --> 01:02:17.172
impossible

01:02:17.173 --> 01:02:18.312
(appendix)

01:02:18.313 --> 01:02:19.382
How to do this...

01:02:23.112 --> 01:02:24.112
how..

01:02:25.483 --> 01:02:27.722
This kind of action has been done before

01:02:30.222 --> 01:02:31.293
stay away

01:02:35.262 --> 01:02:36.662
stay away

01:02:42.403 --> 01:02:45.903
