00:18.643 --> 00:20.270
Damn

00:20.353 --> 00:21.521
"(Tae Ho Choi)"

00:34.284 --> 00:38.163
"Mr. Oh, Yang Jung Hwang,
Do Young Lee, Hyun Joo."

00:46.713 --> 00:47.714
Won't you come home?

00:48.214 --> 00:50.050
I was looking for a house, sir.

00:50.842 --> 00:53.678
Oh God. It's not easy to find a home these days.

00:54.387 --> 00:55.805
What about a honeymoon?

00:56.389 --> 01:00.060
My wife wants to go to Paris
but I don't think we can go because of Covid.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.936
Woe to him. What a fucking virus.

01:06.191 --> 01:07.859
Why did you come this late?

01:12.030 --> 01:13.114
Listen

01:13.615 --> 01:14.783
There is a big issue.

01:15.283 --> 01:18.453
I have been monitoring a loan shark for nearly six months,

01:18.536 --> 01:22.373
This scoundrel films clips of people and threatens them with them.

01:22.874 --> 01:27.504
I came across a list of the scoundrel's victims today.

01:28.213 --> 01:32.050
I will share the data with you,
so we can check it in detail together.

01:34.010 --> 01:34.844
Okay sir.

01:36.679 --> 01:37.931
- Get back to what you're doing.
- Okay.

01:43.144 --> 01:43.978
Okay

01:44.062 --> 01:46.272
He said he received the list today.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.775
He probably didn't do this alone.

01:49.400 --> 01:53.071
Find someone who participated in this and I will pay you 100 million
per person.

01:53.822 --> 01:54.948
Yes sir.

01:55.532 --> 01:57.659
When will you know where In Mok Oh is?

01:57.742 --> 02:02.038
I'll be able to see where he used
his credit card,

02:02.914 --> 02:05.208
In the last seven days by tomorrow morning.

02:06.417 --> 02:08.837
I will send you the money
as soon as I receive the address. Good luck

02:14.134 --> 02:15.093
100 million.

02:17.595 --> 02:18.638
how's it going

02:20.431 --> 02:23.560
Jang Do was the only one
who knew where the hard drive was.

02:23.643 --> 02:26.855
The bastard revealed his whereabouts
when Boss Choi caught him.

02:27.772 --> 02:32.861
The scoundrels who were with him at that time
allied themselves with Director Hong.

02:33.486 --> 02:34.320
"Myung-gil."

02:35.280 --> 02:37.240
Secure one hard drive?

02:40.493 --> 02:42.203
There is only one solid-state drive.

02:44.038 --> 02:47.584
But there is a backup copy of everything
on the laptop

02:47.667 --> 02:50.128
Which we used
to transfer videos to the hard drive.

02:52.505 --> 02:53.590
Good

02:55.175 --> 02:57.218
We must not act at the moment.

02:58.761 --> 03:00.847
If we posted the video at the wrong time,

03:01.347 --> 03:03.433
That bastard Hong,

03:04.100 --> 03:07.812
It will harm our company with tax audit.

03:10.899 --> 03:11.733
Myung Gil,

03:12.692 --> 03:16.237
Wouldn't it be better to let them know
you still have the video?

03:19.032 --> 03:20.783
Work to scare them so they stop fooling around.

03:26.414 --> 03:28.499
How smart you are.

03:29.334 --> 03:30.543
Let's have a toast.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.253
- To you.
- To you.

03:36.758 --> 03:39.052
"Address, market, gas station, rice shop"

03:55.902 --> 03:58.696
"Gohong Grocery"

03:59.405 --> 04:00.740
Did you see him?

04:01.241 --> 04:05.286
I'm not sure. Customers wear masks,
so I'm not sure.

04:06.287 --> 04:07.664
Understood. Is that so then?

04:07.747 --> 04:09.874
Damn, unbelievable.

04:10.708 --> 04:11.793
Take another look.

04:17.298 --> 04:18.341
I don't know

04:18.424 --> 04:19.676
Do you find this funny?

04:20.218 --> 04:22.345
- Excuse me?
- You find this funny?

04:22.971 --> 04:24.222
No, I don't find it so.

04:25.640 --> 04:26.849
the curse

04:27.517 --> 04:29.018
Look away, you bastard.

04:30.019 --> 04:31.771
Take a closer look. do you know him

04:31.854 --> 04:32.689
I don't know

04:32.772 --> 04:36.776
Do you know him or not, you scoundrel? Get up, do you know him or not?

04:36.859 --> 04:37.819
- I don't know.
- No?

04:37.902 --> 04:40.697
Look carefully, you bastard. Do you know him or not?

04:41.197 --> 04:42.198
the bastard

04:42.282 --> 04:43.908
- Shit.
- I should kill you, you bastard.

04:44.617 --> 04:45.493
Look closely.

04:45.576 --> 04:46.661
Hello sir

04:46.744 --> 04:47.745
Hello, welcome

04:47.829 --> 04:49.580
- May I ask you something?
- Sure.

04:49.664 --> 04:53.251
I'm looking for someone, he's my father's friend.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.629
Yes, I know this person.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.589
- Really?
- I know him, why do you want him?

04:58.673 --> 05:01.926
I'm getting married and I wanted to invite him to the wedding.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.011
Good

05:03.094 --> 05:04.220
Do you know his address?

05:04.304 --> 05:07.640
naturally. I deliver rice there every month.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.685
May I take his address?

05:11.185 --> 05:12.395
certainly. I'll tell you about it.

05:51.601 --> 05:54.812
"Catch outside the ring"

05:55.313 --> 05:57.774
"(Stone Village)"

06:00.985 --> 06:01.819
Here he is.

06:06.074 --> 06:07.450
In Beom Kang's file.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.620
I have everything I need to know about him here.

06:12.330 --> 06:13.623
You get your work done quickly.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.376
Speed ​​is important in such matters.

06:16.459 --> 06:17.919
- Thanks.
- Excuse me.

06:19.337 --> 06:20.755
- It's done.
- Yes.

06:37.355 --> 06:39.148
Is that all?

06:39.232 --> 06:40.108
Sorry

06:41.150 --> 06:43.611
You don't know then.

06:44.153 --> 06:47.407
Normally, when someone is assigned
to carry out a request like this,

06:48.491 --> 06:50.034
Offered as a token of thanks.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.370
Good. How much should we pay you?

06:53.413 --> 06:54.705
Well, a lot.

06:54.789 --> 06:59.585
We're a team and a family now
and a generous tip would do me good.

07:00.670 --> 07:01.838
- Well, here you go.
- Yes.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.214
Thanks

07:04.841 --> 07:06.300
Call me anytime.

07:06.384 --> 07:08.344
- We will. Good day.
- Goodbye.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.262
Good

07:15.351 --> 07:17.270
"Ten thousand won"

07:20.314 --> 07:21.983
Damn, I meant a million won.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.488
"Personal information, In Beom Kang."

07:34.537 --> 07:36.080
She asked us not to use it.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.168
But it's worth taking a look at his neighborhood
on a big screen.

07:40.251 --> 07:42.003
What do we do if Da Min comes?

07:43.296 --> 07:46.215
You won't come. She happened to stop
by the last time she checked us out.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.550
It was bad luck.

07:48.801 --> 07:49.635
Look

07:49.719 --> 07:52.597
- “Gangdong-gu,” “Seongro-ro.”
- “Seonggo-ro.”

07:57.894 --> 07:59.937
I told you she would come. Turn it off.

08:07.653 --> 08:08.821
What's wrong?

08:10.281 --> 08:11.824
The place had the smell of miserable men.

08:13.075 --> 08:14.285
Why did you repeat your action?

08:14.368 --> 08:15.745
Go to an internet café.

08:16.412 --> 08:17.288
We are sorry.

08:17.872 --> 08:19.582
We also apologize for the smell of misery.

08:19.665 --> 08:20.917
the curse

08:21.000 --> 08:23.336
It doesn't matter. The room was already messed up.

08:23.419 --> 08:24.253
I was spoiled.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.213
"Da who"!

08:26.672 --> 08:28.966
- What?
- I apologize for what happened today.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.635
I'll take care of that smell.

08:31.260 --> 08:32.345
how

08:32.428 --> 08:33.346
Air distributor.

08:33.846 --> 08:37.642
An air diffuser will get rid
of that miserable old man smell.

08:37.725 --> 08:38.559
truly

08:38.643 --> 08:42.522
First, to get rid of the smell,
you must find an anti-odor.

08:42.605 --> 08:45.691
The scent of Misery is a mixture of intense musky scent

08:45.775 --> 08:47.777
And an unintended smell of rotting firewood.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.363
To get rid of them, we need a counter odor.

08:51.239 --> 08:53.908
Floral and fruity scent.

08:53.991 --> 08:55.910
I use Bice wax and Diptyque fragrance.

08:55.993 --> 08:57.828
- I like this idea.
- That's good.

08:57.912 --> 08:59.539
It's a great

08:59.622 --> 09:02.416
The refreshing sweetness of Pace wax will wash away

09:02.500 --> 09:05.419
The smell of antique misery is about the place here.

09:06.587 --> 09:08.548
We'll get one for you when we leave here.

09:09.173 --> 09:10.591
- A gift.
- Yes.

09:10.675 --> 09:12.635
We'll get two, for the upstairs and downstairs.

09:12.718 --> 09:13.761
And for the bathroom too.

09:13.844 --> 09:15.304
Well, whatever you want.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.264
We agreed

09:25.940 --> 09:28.776
How does In Beom Kang know my number?
Look at this.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.112
unbelievable

09:31.195 --> 09:32.738
Something is definitely wrong.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.001
What's wrong with my grandfather?

09:46.043 --> 09:47.253
Who did this to him?

09:47.920 --> 09:49.130
In reality

09:52.258 --> 09:53.134
Listen...

09:53.718 --> 09:56.345
Come to Four Garden Shopping Center
in Incheon in an hour.

09:56.929 --> 10:00.182
If you call the police, the elderly person will die.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.767
I will kill you, you motherfucker.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.312
Listen...

10:04.395 --> 10:06.856
You need to tell us what else he said,
Da Min.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.816
He asked me to go to Four Garden in an hour.

10:08.899 --> 10:10.234
If we call the police...

10:12.194 --> 10:13.487
My grandfather would be killed, he said.

10:16.907 --> 10:18.492
Let's hurry. There is no time.

10:33.257 --> 10:34.425
- “Gunwoo.”
- Yes?

10:34.508 --> 10:37.178
- How many men do you think there will be?
- At least 30?

10:37.261 --> 10:39.055
They will most likely be armed.

10:39.555 --> 10:41.974
In Beom Kang and this guy, Jung,
will be there.

10:42.058 --> 10:44.185
Should we call Gang Young?

10:45.561 --> 10:48.773
No, this would put Mr. Oh in great danger.

10:50.149 --> 10:51.275
What about our eldest?

10:51.359 --> 10:52.318
Which big?

10:52.401 --> 10:53.235
Mr. Moon.

10:54.528 --> 10:55.571
But he was injured in his arm.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.615
Wouldn't he help in any way possible?

10:58.366 --> 10:59.950
This is true but...

11:00.951 --> 11:01.952
Are you ready?

11:02.036 --> 11:05.373
Yes, but what's the need for a bow, Da Min?

11:06.082 --> 11:07.041
To save my grandfather.

11:07.124 --> 11:10.961
This is completely unacceptable. The situation is very dangerous,
just the two of us will go.

11:13.297 --> 11:14.382
Step aside.

11:15.466 --> 11:16.884
No, Da Min...

11:16.967 --> 11:18.344
- What...
- Wait.

11:26.477 --> 11:27.978
I can help with my style.

11:28.896 --> 11:30.648
I will go and do not negotiate. Do not deter me.

11:32.274 --> 11:33.734
Let's go. We don't have time.

11:34.735 --> 11:36.821
She is a skilled marksman.

11:36.904 --> 11:37.738
Listen

11:38.531 --> 11:39.865
I think it will benefit us.

11:43.869 --> 11:45.746
This is Woo Jin, sir.

11:46.789 --> 11:47.998
mr oh

11:49.417 --> 11:50.751
He has been kidnapped.

11:52.253 --> 11:54.255
Can you help us in any way?

11:54.338 --> 11:56.841
I am also indebted to Mr. Oh.

11:57.341 --> 11:59.760
Don't go without me no matter what.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.220
it's a command

12:48.309 --> 12:51.312
"Gwang Mu-mun, 734th Senior Division."

13:04.450 --> 13:06.202
Are the two younger Marines ready?

13:06.285 --> 13:08.788
- Yes, sir.
- You did your best to prepare, sir.

13:08.871 --> 13:12.666
I put it on because it was left at home.
It's itchy.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.168
I think it's old.

13:14.251 --> 13:16.170
Get out before the warts start to appear.

13:28.390 --> 13:30.267
I will enter from the parking lot...

13:30.768 --> 13:31.644
Who are you

13:32.228 --> 13:33.646
I came to save my grandfather.

13:35.314 --> 13:36.774
She is Mr. Oh's granddaughter.

13:37.608 --> 13:39.276
Understood. Good

13:39.360 --> 13:41.070
You have his facial features.

13:41.695 --> 13:42.780
An hour passed.

13:43.364 --> 13:45.699
Okay but what is that bag?

13:45.783 --> 13:47.076
It is a compound bow.

13:47.952 --> 13:48.786
compound

13:49.411 --> 13:50.704
Rather, it is a compound bow.

13:50.788 --> 13:51.664
Arc...

13:51.747 --> 13:53.958
It's an archer's bow, sir.

13:55.543 --> 13:58.003
correct. Koreans are good at archery.

13:59.630 --> 14:00.631
Is she skilled?

14:00.714 --> 14:01.841
Yes

14:03.342 --> 14:06.220
Okay, me and the archer are going up the stairs
from the parking lot

14:06.303 --> 14:08.138
We head to the top of the building.

14:08.222 --> 14:11.058
And you two Marines
will enter through the front door.

14:11.141 --> 14:13.435
We'll protect you from above, okay?

14:13.519 --> 14:14.937
- Your order, sir.
- Let's move.

14:16.939 --> 14:17.940
- Follow me.
- Okay.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.489
- From here.
- Okay.

14:58.606 --> 14:59.857
Where is Mr. Oh?

15:01.275 --> 15:02.776
Kill them!

15:03.736 --> 15:04.904
Damn

15:16.415 --> 15:18.834
one two Three

15:25.007 --> 15:25.841
the curse

15:47.738 --> 15:48.822
- What?
- Where was he thrown from?

15:48.906 --> 15:49.823
Where was he thrown from?

15:51.700 --> 15:52.701
What a wonderful archer you are.

15:52.785 --> 15:53.911
- Catch them!
- Who is this?

15:53.994 --> 15:54.828
above

15:54.912 --> 15:56.413
- Great.
- Where?

15:56.497 --> 15:58.040
What? What is this

16:02.753 --> 16:04.254
Hey, stop!

16:04.338 --> 16:05.506
above

16:05.589 --> 16:07.091
Who wears black clothes there?

16:07.174 --> 16:08.509
Who throws? Who does this?

16:17.559 --> 16:19.311
Who's wearing blue over there?

16:23.941 --> 16:24.775
Damn

16:24.858 --> 16:27.653
Keep helping the Marines, okay?

16:35.536 --> 16:36.453
Oh blue color.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.498
Were you on one of the running teams?

16:40.082 --> 16:41.250
Screw it.

17:04.356 --> 17:05.232
Get away from here!

17:06.734 --> 17:08.694
he is coming! Make way for him!

17:10.988 --> 17:11.864
They got him!

17:24.960 --> 17:25.836
Damn

17:33.552 --> 17:35.554
What do you do? stand up

17:58.035 --> 17:59.036
the curse

18:16.845 --> 18:17.971
Damn

18:22.267 --> 18:23.310
Damn

19:20.742 --> 19:22.536
You are worthless without your knife.

19:23.704 --> 19:24.913
Take it out of its sheath, you bastard.

19:26.081 --> 19:26.957
let it out

19:32.254 --> 19:33.839
I see you have pride.

19:35.716 --> 19:36.550
Come closer then.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.844
Are you okay sir?

20:20.928 --> 20:22.012
I'm not fine at all.

21:00.926 --> 21:03.804
one two three four

21:03.887 --> 21:06.640
one two three four

21:29.621 --> 21:31.123
Oh running!

21:31.790 --> 21:36.086
You scoundrel. We don't have time. Wake up.

21:36.169 --> 21:38.630
Where is Mr. Oh?

21:39.715 --> 21:43.468
Look at this bastard,
he gives the old marine a terrifying look.

21:43.552 --> 21:45.721
- Archer, give me an arrow.
- What?

21:46.305 --> 21:48.056
Don't worry. Give me an arrow for a moment.

21:48.765 --> 21:52.185
This bastard is a loyal troll.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.146
I was like you too,

21:54.229 --> 21:56.440
When Mr. Choi was among us.

21:56.940 --> 22:01.945
Do you know what happens to a troll who loses his master?

22:02.487 --> 22:05.824
He loses his way and attacks anyone he sees!

22:11.955 --> 22:13.749
Don't worry, you're fine.

22:14.583 --> 22:16.752
You are experiencing psychological trauma and are not in pain.

22:16.835 --> 22:18.670
Actual pain

22:19.796 --> 22:21.298
You will feel it when you take it off!

22:25.344 --> 22:26.803
Marine,

22:27.554 --> 22:29.389
Cover the archer's ears, please.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.313
You're not married, right?

22:37.189 --> 22:38.023
Good

22:38.648 --> 22:42.652
Family is the most important thing a person has in his life.

22:42.736 --> 22:46.990
But without this, you will be unable to start a family.

22:47.991 --> 22:52.496
Work or family. Choose

22:53.538 --> 22:56.166
If you insist on choosing work,
even in this situation,

22:56.249 --> 22:57.959
I will admit that you are truly professional.

22:58.043 --> 23:01.630
But in return, I will pierce your balls for you.

23:02.130 --> 23:03.048
Why

23:03.548 --> 23:05.050
Because I'm a professional person too.

23:06.134 --> 23:07.219
What will be your choice?

23:08.470 --> 23:10.013
I'll give you three seconds.

23:10.097 --> 23:11.223
three

23:11.306 --> 23:12.265
two

23:13.850 --> 23:15.018
One

23:16.186 --> 23:19.189
- Hey!
- What? Why

23:21.066 --> 23:22.734
I will speak, sir.

23:27.406 --> 23:28.323
Lower your head.

23:29.699 --> 23:30.867
Get on, fast!

23:31.993 --> 23:33.537
I said keep your head down.

23:38.458 --> 23:43.130
We're going to rescue Mr. Oh.
Can you spare In Beom Kang?

23:43.213 --> 23:45.215
What are you saying? I have to go too.

23:45.298 --> 23:46.800
We will do this ourselves.

23:47.759 --> 23:49.594
Your arm is in critical condition, sir.

23:50.178 --> 23:52.055
Damn, this is unbelievable.

23:52.139 --> 23:56.268
Sir, In Beom Kang knows
where Myung Gil Kim is secretly hiding money,

23:56.351 --> 24:00.230
He knows the location of the safe and the money in it
, and he knows where Mr. Choi's gold was hidden.

24:00.313 --> 24:03.442
Please extract all this information from him
using the spirit of the Navy.

24:03.525 --> 24:04.609
Please sir.

24:05.569 --> 24:07.863
OK I will do it

24:09.448 --> 24:10.866
Save Mr. Oh no matter what.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.367
Your order, sir.

24:12.993 --> 24:14.494
Let's go. Get on, Da Min.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.880
"National Police Agency"

24:29.926 --> 24:30.760
here

24:33.096 --> 24:34.139
How does this look to you?

24:35.307 --> 24:38.727
Sir, I've seen him standing next to
the Blue House chief of staff before.

24:39.936 --> 24:41.480
- Chief of Staff?
- Yes, sir.

24:41.563 --> 24:43.857
That hooked nose and ears. I am sure

24:45.192 --> 24:47.736
Why would a moneylender pay a bribe to the presidential office?

24:47.819 --> 24:48.778
Maybe he likes to snoop?

24:49.362 --> 24:51.907
Or does it have a bigger role than we realize?

24:54.993 --> 24:56.953
"Drunk Gun Woo"

24:58.288 --> 24:59.122
Welcome

24:59.206 --> 25:01.333
Welcome. I apologize for calling so late

25:01.416 --> 25:03.960
But we didn't know what to do, so I called.

25:04.544 --> 25:06.713
- What's going on?
- Myung-gil kidnapped Mr. Oh.

25:06.796 --> 25:09.257
I'm heading to Seoryong with Woo-jin now.

25:09.341 --> 25:10.509
Just the two of you?

25:10.592 --> 25:12.385
Why did you tell me this now?

25:12.469 --> 25:16.556
I apologize for this but they said
they would kill Mr. Oh if we reported it to the police.

25:16.640 --> 25:17.641
Wait.

25:18.558 --> 25:20.352
Did Myung Gil Kim contact you personally?

25:20.435 --> 25:23.605
No, we caught one of his henchmen and he told us so.

25:23.688 --> 25:26.066
So you don't know for sure
if Kim was there?

25:26.149 --> 25:26.983
This is correct

25:28.902 --> 25:32.322
send me the site. I'm heading over there.
Don't barge in and wait for me.

25:32.405 --> 25:33.281
Good

25:34.616 --> 25:36.451
- Send him the website, Woo Jin.
- Okay.

25:41.081 --> 25:42.499
- Yes, sir.
- “Jae Min.”

25:42.582 --> 25:44.376
Come to the conference room immediately.

25:45.001 --> 25:46.002
Your order, sir.

25:52.884 --> 25:54.135
"Meeting Room No. 1"

25:54.219 --> 25:57.597
Ask for support, Jae Min.
The place is in Buseongmyeon, Seoryong.

25:57.681 --> 25:59.724
This has something to do with the issue I mentioned last time.

25:59.808 --> 26:00.642
Your order, sir.

26:00.725 --> 26:01.560
Good

26:01.643 --> 26:02.852
When did you see them?

26:03.353 --> 26:05.438
Nearly a month ago.

26:06.439 --> 26:07.857
"Lieutenant Jae Min Kim"

26:10.360 --> 26:11.194
Okay

26:22.747 --> 26:24.749
"Mr. Myung Gil Kim"

26:26.918 --> 26:28.378
The police are on their way to you.

26:28.878 --> 26:29.838
Concept

26:38.179 --> 26:40.724
The police are coming! Start cleaning!

27:03.288 --> 27:06.166
Good. Check if there is a back entrance.

27:06.249 --> 27:08.126
Move! quickly

27:19.346 --> 27:20.472
Turn off the engine.

27:20.555 --> 27:21.389
Good

27:21.931 --> 27:24.392
We'll check the general situation, Da Min.
Wait here.

27:26.936 --> 27:30.065
We arrived before you and searched the place.
Nothing happened. It's a flounder farm.

27:30.148 --> 27:31.149
Good

27:33.485 --> 27:35.695
Please talk to the bastard
in the trunk.

27:39.199 --> 27:40.367
Who is this scoundrel?

27:40.867 --> 27:42.202
He is Myung-gil's follower.

27:42.827 --> 27:44.037
The person who stabbed me.

27:47.916 --> 27:50.335
I'm a policeman, so answer honestly.

27:52.087 --> 27:53.713
Nod your head, you bastard.

27:55.256 --> 27:56.675
Is this Sol's fish farm?

27:59.260 --> 28:00.679
Does anyone know we're coming?

28:04.974 --> 28:05.975
"Gang Young."

28:06.476 --> 28:09.062
This man's comrades ran away in the middle of the fight.

28:09.729 --> 28:11.564
Maybe they warned them.

28:16.403 --> 28:18.863
Leave this man here and get out of here.

28:18.947 --> 28:20.323
You weren't here, okay?

28:20.407 --> 28:21.324
Well
Well

28:21.408 --> 28:22.992
- Were you injured?
- No.

28:23.993 --> 28:24.828
“Han Gu.”

28:35.171 --> 28:36.673
Where is my grandfather?

28:38.091 --> 28:40.844
Let's wait. Investigators will get back to us with information about him.

28:42.053 --> 28:43.430
There's no time for this.

28:47.350 --> 28:48.601
We must find him.

28:50.061 --> 28:51.688
We will do this no matter what.

28:52.188 --> 28:54.983
The safe, you scoundrel!

28:55.066 --> 28:57.944
Where is Myung Gil Kim's safe?

28:58.027 --> 28:59.154
Damn, unbelievable!

28:59.237 --> 29:02.907
You'll die, you bastard, if you stay like this!

29:17.464 --> 29:18.590
Give me a cigarette.

29:20.467 --> 29:21.551
You bastard!

29:27.056 --> 29:28.183
- Hit me.
- You're doomed.

29:28.266 --> 29:30.435
Hit me harder!

29:34.522 --> 29:37.066
"Best Pork, Beomseong Distribution Outlet."

29:46.868 --> 29:47.744
How did it go?

29:48.411 --> 29:49.704
What about Mr. Oh?

29:49.788 --> 29:51.039
We couldn't find it.

29:51.122 --> 29:53.208
I think those bastards took him somewhere else.

29:53.291 --> 29:54.667
the curse

29:54.751 --> 29:55.794
Did he say something?

29:55.877 --> 29:59.088
He's a stubborn bastard. He won't speak.

30:05.136 --> 30:06.596
You're having a good time, aren't you?

30:08.056 --> 30:11.267
- Do you want to see something more interesting?
- What are you saying, you scoundrel?

30:23.571 --> 30:24.572
the curse

30:25.156 --> 30:27.575
my lord! That bastard bit his tongue!

30:27.659 --> 30:28.868
Damn

30:28.952 --> 30:29.828
Hurry, sir!

30:31.496 --> 30:33.331
the curse! Screw it!

30:33.915 --> 30:35.542
- Hey!
- Shit.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.752
- In Beom Kang, wake up.
- Damn it!

30:38.545 --> 30:40.755
- Call an ambulance, Woo Jin!
- Okay.

30:41.256 --> 30:42.340
Hey!

30:42.924 --> 30:45.593
If we send him,
how will we find Myung-gil Kim's safe?

30:45.677 --> 30:48.847
However, we cannot afford to let someone die,
sir.

30:49.722 --> 30:51.474
If he dies, we won't get to the vault.

30:52.767 --> 30:54.561
Damn! Give it to me

30:54.644 --> 30:56.980
Help me download it please.

31:03.903 --> 31:05.405
Are you okay sir?

31:06.239 --> 31:08.032
Wake up sir! Are you well

31:14.706 --> 31:15.874
Welcome

31:15.957 --> 31:16.916
Welcome

31:17.792 --> 31:18.877
Where is the owner?

31:19.377 --> 31:20.670
On vacation

31:20.753 --> 31:21.963
Good

31:22.839 --> 31:24.966
I want Ethiopian iced coffee.

31:25.049 --> 31:25.884
Good

31:27.385 --> 31:29.929
Help yourself. Please wait.
- Okay, thank you.

31:31.264 --> 31:32.891
“My happy family, I will keep you safe.”

31:48.823 --> 31:51.451
"President Myung-Gil Kim,
attached file, video clip."

31:57.081 --> 31:58.458
the curse

32:04.255 --> 32:05.256
Hello, Minbeom.

32:06.215 --> 32:09.052
Myung-Gil Kim still has
the video he took of me.

32:09.636 --> 32:11.054
Just sent it to me.

32:11.137 --> 32:12.889
What

32:15.892 --> 32:16.976
Welcome

32:17.060 --> 32:18.227
"Gang Young"?

32:19.020 --> 32:19.854
Welcome

32:26.653 --> 32:27.487
the curse

32:33.826 --> 32:34.702
Damn

33:12.407 --> 33:14.158
Scoundrels.

33:14.951 --> 33:16.452
You bastard

33:20.665 --> 33:21.499
salt

33:21.582 --> 33:22.583
What

33:22.667 --> 33:24.085
salt

33:48.443 --> 33:49.736
Someone was shocked!

33:49.819 --> 33:51.237
- She must be dead.
- Check.

33:51.320 --> 33:52.613
What happened

33:52.697 --> 33:54.699
- Call 911.
- I think someone died.

33:57.493 --> 33:59.245
"Mr. Oh"

34:02.165 --> 34:04.375
Gun-woo, come on. faster

34:12.967 --> 34:14.469
You despicable fools.

34:15.219 --> 34:17.305
Why did you cause a major crisis?

34:18.890 --> 34:19.807
What do you want

34:22.310 --> 34:24.520
Come to the fish farm today
by 9pm.

34:25.188 --> 34:29.984
If you call the police again,
I'll chop up In Mok Oh and feed him to the fish.

34:30.693 --> 34:31.903
Answer me.

34:33.404 --> 34:36.949
I got rid of Gang Young Min and his men,
so don't mess with me.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.452
I said I would kill your mother

34:40.036 --> 34:41.662
If it appears again.

34:43.247 --> 34:44.082
see you there

34:47.376 --> 34:48.878
"Gang Young"

34:55.093 --> 34:56.928
They got Gang Young? But he's a policeman.

34:57.804 --> 34:59.597
The situation will be very dangerous this time.

34:59.680 --> 35:01.140
We must go alone.

35:01.933 --> 35:02.767
Excuse me

35:04.977 --> 35:06.604
How long have you been there?

35:06.687 --> 35:08.272
Since the beginning

35:09.732 --> 35:11.150
Don't step aside.

35:11.234 --> 35:12.568
I'm going to save my grandfather.

35:18.699 --> 35:19.534
come with me

35:29.710 --> 35:34.006
If something bad happens to Mr. Oh before our eyes,

35:35.007 --> 35:37.844
Da Min will inevitably collapse,
as happened with Hyun Joo.

35:39.262 --> 35:41.848
I don't want to witness that again, Woo Jin.

35:42.598 --> 35:43.474
But, Gun Woo,

35:44.600 --> 35:46.602
There is something different from our situation then.

35:47.186 --> 35:48.187
Do you know what it is?

35:49.355 --> 35:50.231
at that time

35:51.274 --> 35:53.693
The invincible marine duo was scattered.

35:54.610 --> 35:59.031
We are not currently divided
and we are much stronger. Have you forgotten?

35:59.991 --> 36:01.868
one two three four five

36:01.951 --> 36:03.786
one two three four five

36:05.079 --> 36:06.789
Okay

36:07.748 --> 36:08.624
Therefore,

36:10.334 --> 36:12.587
Let's work together and save everyone.

36:13.629 --> 36:15.131
Mr Oh and Da Min,

36:15.840 --> 36:18.426
And everyone Kim hurt.

36:23.431 --> 36:24.348
With determination?

36:24.432 --> 36:25.516
With determination!

36:27.476 --> 36:28.644
With determination!

36:29.145 --> 36:30.313
With determination!

36:41.073 --> 36:42.158
Why did you stop us?

36:42.950 --> 36:45.661
Woo Jin and I will go first.
Stay to watch the place.

36:45.745 --> 36:47.538
Move forward once you find a shooting position.

36:47.622 --> 36:48.581
Seems like a good idea.

36:49.457 --> 36:50.458
Anzali

37:14.023 --> 37:16.442
the curse. He brought me down too far.

37:20.238 --> 37:21.322
good idea

37:21.405 --> 37:22.240
What

37:23.032 --> 37:26.035
You put her down so she wouldn't get hurt, right?

37:26.827 --> 37:29.914
In fact, I lowered it so we wouldn't get caught.

37:31.707 --> 37:32.708
Was it far away?

37:34.794 --> 37:36.337
It will take ten minutes.

37:36.420 --> 37:38.214
Let's finish this quickly on our own.

37:38.798 --> 37:39.632
good idea

38:47.116 --> 38:48.868
Kill them!

38:53.706 --> 38:55.708
These bastards have a huge number of weapons.

39:02.840 --> 39:04.425
"Woo Jin!"

39:25.738 --> 39:26.947
You bastard!

39:27.865 --> 39:28.783
Damn

39:36.665 --> 39:38.125
Leave me, damn it!

39:41.504 --> 39:42.505
Let me!

39:45.466 --> 39:46.300
Damn

39:50.388 --> 39:51.764
You bastard!

39:53.099 --> 39:54.183
Oh damn!

39:55.226 --> 39:56.560
What is this

40:16.455 --> 40:17.540
You bastard!

40:21.127 --> 40:22.378
You bastard!

40:22.461 --> 40:23.838
Damn

40:28.175 --> 40:29.093
Hey you

40:30.136 --> 40:32.179
Can't even get rid of two guys?

40:34.390 --> 40:35.307
I'm sorry sir.

40:35.391 --> 40:38.227
She always apologizes.

40:41.313 --> 40:42.565
And now.

40:43.983 --> 40:45.651
Enough

40:47.319 --> 40:48.529
Hey!

40:48.612 --> 40:50.656
If you two bastards take a step,

40:50.739 --> 40:53.367
I will cut his throat, so do whatever you want.

40:54.702 --> 40:56.287
Okay. They stopped moving.

41:04.503 --> 41:07.756
What are you doing, you bastards? Hurry and kill them.

41:08.549 --> 41:09.842
Should I kill them myself?

41:10.342 --> 41:12.678
How amazing you are, you bastards.

41:18.100 --> 41:19.101
Bow down!

41:22.021 --> 41:23.939
- What is this?
- What happened?

41:28.277 --> 41:31.322
You vile! Come here

41:31.405 --> 41:34.116
I said kill them! You bastards!

41:34.200 --> 41:35.993
what are you doing? Leave me, you idiot!

41:43.751 --> 41:45.544
- Let me!
- Let's go to the hospital.

41:48.130 --> 41:49.882
Kill them! Let's go

42:14.490 --> 42:17.618
serious! Are you well

42:18.661 --> 42:19.578
This is me, Da Min.

42:26.710 --> 42:29.171
She took my eyebrows off.

42:32.007 --> 42:33.259
Are you okay, Mr. Oh?

42:35.427 --> 42:36.929
Thanks

42:49.441 --> 42:50.568
What is this

42:50.651 --> 42:52.069
They moved more quickly.

42:52.152 --> 42:54.071
Hurry up and get to work!

43:01.453 --> 43:02.371
Who is Tariq?

43:03.038 --> 43:04.290
Chinese food delivery boy.

43:13.674 --> 43:15.050
What is this, bastards?

43:15.551 --> 43:17.845
Stand your ground, motherfucker!

43:20.764 --> 43:23.017
They searched the whole area.

43:23.100 --> 43:24.852
- Search every inch!
- What is this place?

43:28.022 --> 43:29.690
I find it! Come here everyone!

43:31.609 --> 43:34.236
- Those bastards...
- What were they doing here?

43:38.907 --> 43:41.619
I'm Yoon Seo-yang,
from the Major Crimes Investigation Department.

43:42.453 --> 43:43.662
Here's a search warrant.

43:43.746 --> 43:46.540
We will conduct a search and seize your property.

43:46.624 --> 43:48.584
I appreciate your cooperation. Come in.

43:49.418 --> 43:50.544
Get in quickly.

43:55.841 --> 43:57.092
Mr. Jae Min Kim?

43:57.176 --> 44:00.471
You are under arrest for murder,
bribery and other charges.

44:01.263 --> 44:03.932
the curse. What a worse day.

44:04.600 --> 44:05.434
Let's go

44:07.353 --> 44:08.187
- Sir.
- Yes.

44:18.947 --> 44:22.034
The warrant was issued quickly
so we went to Kim's house.

44:22.117 --> 44:24.328
Several phones were found in his dresser drawer.

44:25.412 --> 44:28.832
We tracked the numbers,
they were all dead or missing people.

44:28.916 --> 44:30.042
Willah

44:30.125 --> 44:34.421
This crazy bastard kept the phones of the people he killed.

44:35.172 --> 44:36.548
He can't escape this.

44:36.632 --> 44:38.676
Not even the president of America can save him.

44:38.759 --> 44:40.052
What about escaping abroad?

44:40.552 --> 44:42.930
He's wanted now,
so this won't be easy.

44:43.013 --> 44:46.141
People often escape
to China on cargo ships.

44:46.225 --> 44:48.394
Kim is a wanted criminal and one of the most dangerous people.

44:48.977 --> 44:51.397
We will intensify surveillance on possible infiltration routes.

44:51.480 --> 44:52.564
He won't flee Korea.

44:52.648 --> 44:54.525
But this is not impossible.

44:55.567 --> 44:59.530
I see you all think this matter is over,
but I'm so nervous right now.

44:59.613 --> 45:01.573
That bastard still has a video of me.

45:01.657 --> 45:03.909
If he loses his mind and spreads it, I will be finished.

45:09.415 --> 45:10.249
"Gang Young."

45:11.208 --> 45:13.585
I should see that bastard behind bars.

45:14.920 --> 45:15.754
"Who day?"

45:18.549 --> 45:19.717
I understand your position.

45:23.137 --> 45:25.013
But consider Han Guo's condition now.

45:26.181 --> 45:27.808
And Tae Young hasn't regained consciousness yet.

45:28.851 --> 45:30.102
We need some time.

45:38.444 --> 45:39.403
I will help you.

45:40.738 --> 45:42.656
It doesn't end until it's completely over.

45:43.824 --> 45:47.286
Can you find us where Jang Do Im is?

45:47.870 --> 45:48.871
Why "Jang Do Im"?

45:48.954 --> 45:52.958
Jang Do Im is probably hiding
somewhere to stay away from Myung Gil Kim.

45:53.041 --> 45:57.963
But I think Jang Do Im might know
where Myung Gil Kim might flee to.

45:58.046 --> 46:01.383
True, Jang Do Im may have advised him
on how to escape the country.

46:01.467 --> 46:03.886
He mentioned that he was responsible for things like this.

46:05.512 --> 46:06.638
Okay, I'll look into this.

46:14.062 --> 46:15.522
How much cash is it?

46:15.606 --> 46:17.608
I can lower the price to 18 million.

46:18.776 --> 46:24.406
Jang Do Im hasn't used a phone
or card in his name in the last six months.

46:24.490 --> 46:27.075
He avoided everything that could be traced.

46:27.159 --> 46:28.786
Is there another way?

46:29.369 --> 46:34.082
Well, all we've been able to find so far
is his bank account number.

46:34.166 --> 46:37.920
The last cash withdrawal transaction took place
in March in Suwon.

46:38.003 --> 46:39.505
Isn't that enough to find it?

46:39.588 --> 46:43.050
There are clips that may take a few months of time,
so we need someone dedicated to checking them.

46:43.133 --> 46:45.219
It will take some time.

46:46.386 --> 46:49.765
May we have his account number?

46:49.848 --> 46:52.309
This bastard is probably
in financial difficulty right now.

46:52.392 --> 46:54.061
Transfer the money to that account.

46:54.144 --> 46:57.481
When sending it, write your phone number
in the sender’s name field.

46:57.564 --> 46:59.149
Then he will contact you both. This is guaranteed.

46:59.233 --> 47:01.819
- How much should I send?
- If it is a large amount, it will do.

47:02.402 --> 47:03.278
Ten thousand won?

47:04.363 --> 47:06.949
I wondered if I should have mentioned that
last time,

47:07.032 --> 47:09.827
But in our field, this
is what we mean by “a large amount,” which varies.

47:09.910 --> 47:12.538
The large sum she intended
for Kang's personal data,

47:12.621 --> 47:14.748
It was supposed to be a million
, not 10,000.

47:14.832 --> 47:15.999
1 million won?

47:16.083 --> 47:19.169
Of course, it's not my intention
to demand this money from you now.

47:19.253 --> 47:20.629
I'm not stingy.

47:20.712 --> 47:21.964
We are a family.

47:22.047 --> 47:24.591
How much are we talking about in our situation?

47:24.675 --> 47:26.468
He won't be satisfied with a million won.

47:27.010 --> 47:27.845
Ten million won.

47:29.429 --> 47:30.889
And he will come immediately.

47:39.773 --> 47:43.735
Your wounds do not heal because you continue to drink alcohol...

47:43.819 --> 47:45.195
the curse

47:55.873 --> 47:57.583
- Doctor.
- Yes, sir.

47:58.166 --> 47:59.209
Just do your job.

47:59.751 --> 48:00.586
Your order, sir.

48:06.008 --> 48:07.009
Damn

48:07.092 --> 48:08.260
‫66،‬

48:08.886 --> 48:10.095
‫67،‬

48:10.178 --> 48:12.347
‫68، 69.‬

48:12.848 --> 48:13.724
"Woo Jin."

48:14.808 --> 48:15.976
No number appears.

48:22.232 --> 48:23.275
Welcome

48:28.113 --> 48:28.947
Welcome

48:32.367 --> 48:33.201
Welcome

48:35.078 --> 48:35.913
You are the young man

48:36.914 --> 48:38.540
The one who was with President Choi, right?

48:42.169 --> 48:43.003
its me

48:43.921 --> 48:45.881
The police told you my account number.

48:47.799 --> 48:50.636
What is the matter? Did you send me money?

48:51.219 --> 48:53.388
Myung Gil Kim escaped.

48:54.181 --> 48:55.057
Why

48:55.641 --> 48:59.853
The police raided Myung Gil Kim's house
and found evidence that he killed people.

48:59.937 --> 49:00.896
When did that happen

49:01.396 --> 49:02.230
Two days ago

49:03.231 --> 49:06.109
You know where he's going to run, right?

49:08.820 --> 49:09.655
Yes I know

49:10.322 --> 49:11.490
Please

49:11.573 --> 49:14.701
We want to catch Myung Gil Kim. help us

49:18.038 --> 49:19.247
how much will you pay

49:22.125 --> 49:23.335
A large amount.

49:23.919 --> 49:26.421
Damn, you've got to be kidding me.

49:28.298 --> 49:30.175
- A billion!
- A billion?

49:30.258 --> 49:32.844
I trusted Chairman Choi and my situation worsened.

49:32.928 --> 49:34.513
I deserve this amount of compensation.

49:34.596 --> 49:36.306
But currently, we only have...

49:36.390 --> 49:40.602
Within four days, Myung Gil Kim will flee
out of the country by the means I told him about.

49:41.770 --> 49:43.021
You know my account, right?

49:44.189 --> 49:45.357
think about it

49:48.235 --> 49:50.112
unbelievable

49:50.988 --> 49:52.364
Where will we get a billion?

49:53.532 --> 49:55.534
Should we ask Mr. Oh?

49:55.617 --> 49:57.160
Mr. Oh has no money.

49:57.744 --> 50:00.080
The money he gave us
was the last available money.

50:00.872 --> 50:01.707
Wait.

50:07.713 --> 50:08.755
How many are here?

50:11.883 --> 50:13.385
I think about 300 million.

50:13.468 --> 50:14.761
Much less than we want.

50:18.181 --> 50:19.975
Should we ask for it from Min Beom?

50:20.058 --> 50:22.811
Jang Do Im
is the one who filmed that video for Min Beom.

50:23.478 --> 50:25.981
Do you think it will help us implement this?

50:26.815 --> 50:30.944
But Min Beom is the only one
who has that kind of money.

50:32.154 --> 50:33.947
Let's ask him for once, okay?

50:42.581 --> 50:43.874
Here they are, sir.

50:49.421 --> 50:51.048
Do you trust Jang Do Im?

50:53.633 --> 50:54.468
In reality

50:55.635 --> 51:00.182
We think we can trust
the information he has.

51:01.099 --> 51:03.393
What should I do if he takes the billion
and flees the country?

51:04.227 --> 51:05.312
What will we do then?

51:25.415 --> 51:29.044
Jang Do Im breaks his promise and runs away

51:29.127 --> 51:31.338
We will chase him until we catch him.

51:31.922 --> 51:33.799
I can promise you that.

51:49.022 --> 51:50.398
Make sure you keep this promise.

51:52.025 --> 51:53.443
- I'll do it.
- Okay.

51:56.279 --> 51:58.740
“I received a billion won.”

52:11.920 --> 52:13.839
Okay, I'm done checking it out. Go ahead.

52:13.922 --> 52:14.756
Good

52:15.507 --> 52:16.341
you can go

52:39.489 --> 52:43.326
"Pohang Station"

53:09.769 --> 53:11.938
"Anonymous caller"

53:15.192 --> 53:16.359
Write

53:17.110 --> 53:20.572
The day after tomorrow at 1pm,
a ship called Nike will depart from Pohang.

53:20.655 --> 53:21.865
To Ho Chi Minh City.

53:21.948 --> 53:24.743
Kim gave political funding
to a high-ranking Vietnamese official.

53:24.826 --> 53:27.621
He will leave with all the money he has hidden.

53:28.288 --> 53:30.957
The container number is “TJBU 9004230”.

53:31.458 --> 53:34.085
His money will be hidden in a container inside the truck.

53:34.169 --> 53:36.546
Should we move when he gets on the ship?

53:36.630 --> 53:38.548
It's a big ship and won't be easy to find.

53:38.632 --> 53:39.466
How do we find it?

53:40.050 --> 53:41.843
Board the ship with him!

53:44.721 --> 53:46.514
You mean we take it to Vietnam?

53:46.598 --> 53:48.141
This is your decision.

53:48.642 --> 53:50.435
- I'll end the call now.
- Wait.

53:50.518 --> 53:53.146
What should we do
if we want to get on that ship?

53:54.022 --> 53:57.442
I will send you the data of one of my acquaintances.
Tell him that I sent you and come to an agreement with him.

53:57.525 --> 53:59.736
And for your information, he likes to get paid in cash.

54:06.159 --> 54:07.160
We received the message.

54:16.211 --> 54:19.130
I didn't know what you needed,
so I prepared a bunch of everything for you.

54:20.340 --> 54:21.424
Thank you sir.

54:21.508 --> 54:22.926
Take care of yourself.

54:23.760 --> 54:24.594
Okay sir.

54:25.762 --> 54:26.721
We agreed

54:27.931 --> 54:28.807
Yes sir.

54:31.351 --> 54:32.185
Let's go upstairs.

54:33.228 --> 54:34.271
You beat me.

54:34.813 --> 54:35.772
I want to talk to them.

54:38.858 --> 54:39.859
Good

54:45.657 --> 54:47.409
Thank you both for your help.

54:48.410 --> 54:49.911
We are the ones who should thank you.

54:59.296 --> 55:01.464
Goodbye, Da Min.

55:03.174 --> 55:04.175
Good-bye

55:04.259 --> 55:05.093
Help yourself

55:10.390 --> 55:12.017
You know my number, right?

55:20.734 --> 55:21.568
Let's go

55:32.370 --> 55:34.497
- Yes, Min Beom.
- Are you on the way?

55:35.332 --> 55:36.458
We're on the way.

55:37.334 --> 55:39.085
Don't get hurt.

55:39.586 --> 55:40.420
Good

55:40.503 --> 55:42.756
Gang Young and I will handle the rest.

55:43.631 --> 55:44.758
drive carefully

55:44.841 --> 55:45.675
Good

56:20.460 --> 56:21.586
Let's hurry.

56:21.669 --> 56:22.796
Wait a minute.

56:23.546 --> 56:24.381
Moment

56:37.018 --> 56:37.852
"Woo Jin."

56:41.356 --> 56:42.190
Good

56:55.787 --> 56:56.621
Let's sail.

57:07.549 --> 57:09.843
- Let's check out the inside of the ship first.
- With determination!

57:09.926 --> 57:10.927
With determination!

57:52.051 --> 57:53.136
Myung Gil Kim!

58:13.448 --> 58:14.657
the curse

58:25.084 --> 58:26.503
Okay

01:02:57.398 --> 01:02:58.941
If she shows up again...

01:03:01.944 --> 01:03:03.237
I will kill you.

01:03:48.449 --> 01:03:49.283
“Gun-woo.”

01:03:53.704 --> 01:03:54.789
Are you well

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:07.760
What is the matter

01:04:11.013 --> 01:04:11.848
"Woo Jin."

01:04:15.601 --> 01:04:17.562
I think I've become a troll.

01:04:35.037 --> 01:04:38.249
Gun Woo, did you forget the boxer's heart?

01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:41.878
We just have to find a way back to it.

01:04:42.879 --> 01:04:45.590
We agreed? Let's get back together.

01:04:51.137 --> 01:04:51.971
Good

01:04:52.972 --> 01:04:53.890
Let's go back.

01:05:02.815 --> 01:05:03.649
Give me your hand.

01:05:22.543 --> 01:05:23.711
Wow! "Woo Jin!"

01:05:28.174 --> 01:05:29.717
Wow, we found it!

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:39.602
Welcome

01:05:39.685 --> 01:05:42.229
- Where are you, Min Beom?
- I'm almost there.

01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:44.482
Did you find the gold bars?

01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:46.651
Yes, we found them all.

01:05:47.818 --> 01:05:48.653
And the phone?

01:05:50.363 --> 01:05:51.489
I'll go get him.

01:05:52.198 --> 01:05:53.824
- Woo Jin, here.
- Okay.

01:05:53.908 --> 01:05:55.409
- Yes.
- Let's go.

01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:05.252
How did things go?

01:06:05.336 --> 01:06:07.213
I finally got the phone.

01:06:10.466 --> 01:06:11.509
Well done.

01:06:12.009 --> 01:06:15.012
I requested support from Interpol.
They will wait in Vietnam.

01:06:16.013 --> 01:06:17.181
The crisis is over.

01:06:17.264 --> 01:06:19.350
I suffered greatly, my young friend.

01:06:19.433 --> 01:06:20.518
Thank you, Gang Young.

01:06:36.492 --> 01:06:38.077
What would you like to do?

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:48.713
Mr. Choi has always wanted to help the poor
receive decent health care,

01:06:49.964 --> 01:06:53.467
Therefore, I would like this money to be used
for what Mr. Choi wished.

01:06:53.551 --> 01:06:55.886
What do you think

01:06:57.555 --> 01:06:59.306
Don't you want money for yourself?

01:07:03.102 --> 01:07:05.229
I definitely want to.

01:07:06.105 --> 01:07:08.190
But that's not my money.

01:07:08.941 --> 01:07:12.194
I returned Mr. Choi's good deed for his kindness.

01:07:12.278 --> 01:07:14.196
I kept my promise to him.

01:07:16.032 --> 01:07:17.158
Good

01:07:18.492 --> 01:07:19.326
My friend.

01:07:20.244 --> 01:07:24.081
We have 168 bars,
each weighing seven kilograms.

01:07:24.165 --> 01:07:27.835
Each of them is worth 500 million at its
current price, meaning in total, approximately 84 billion.

01:07:28.586 --> 01:07:30.921
If you want, we can take it

01:07:31.005 --> 01:07:33.966
To establish a social welfare institution
under the name “AIL” Group.

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:38.304
Through this institution,
we will be able to provide medical assistance to those in need.

01:07:39.263 --> 01:07:42.308
Or should I ask our company
to add an amount of money

01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:44.685
To establish a hospital?

01:07:45.311 --> 01:07:47.313
-That sounds like a great idea.
-Doesn't it?

01:07:47.396 --> 01:07:48.397
It's a great

01:07:48.481 --> 01:07:50.357
I think my father will like it.

01:07:50.983 --> 01:07:53.319
I believe this will help us improve our company image.

01:07:53.402 --> 01:07:55.196
We also contribute to doing good.

01:07:55.279 --> 01:07:58.616
I will start creating it as soon as I finish
the hotel issue.

01:07:58.699 --> 01:08:02.912
Min Beom, would you please include
Mr. Choi in the hospital name?

01:08:03.954 --> 01:08:06.499
-What was his name?
-Tae Ho Choi.

01:08:07.041 --> 01:08:09.835
Honestly, this won't be easy.

01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:12.379
But I will keep this in mind.

01:08:12.463 --> 01:08:13.631
I thank you

01:08:21.472 --> 01:08:22.473
What

01:08:22.556 --> 01:08:24.600
I will pay the shortfall with my own money.

01:08:25.101 --> 01:08:27.269
Consider it a reward for your mastery of what you did.

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:29.855
No need for that. I am completely satisfied.

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:32.441
Mr. Choi would have done the same.

01:08:33.067 --> 01:08:34.068
Take them.

01:08:39.031 --> 01:08:41.408
Don't you know what you're saying?

01:08:44.245 --> 01:08:45.579
"Thank you" is enough for me.

01:08:46.997 --> 01:08:48.666
Thank you, Mr. Choi.

01:08:48.749 --> 01:08:49.667
On the contrary.

01:08:51.001 --> 01:08:52.837
I'm the one who should thank you.

01:08:55.714 --> 01:08:57.424
Thank you very much

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:09.979
Pick it up!

01:09:10.062 --> 01:09:11.647
- No!
- Let's go!

01:09:12.565 --> 01:09:13.899
- I'll come.
- Here.

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:15.109
I will come.

01:09:16.527 --> 01:09:17.778
This too

01:09:20.239 --> 01:09:21.407
Hello, Gun Woo.

01:09:22.324 --> 01:09:23.367
Where are you

01:09:25.911 --> 01:09:27.621
Hey! “Gun-woo!”

01:09:41.468 --> 01:09:42.469
My dear son.

01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:48.976
"Woo Jin."

01:09:50.769 --> 01:09:52.813
What happened to your face?

01:09:53.647 --> 01:09:55.608
You both suffered.

01:09:59.486 --> 01:10:01.488
The crisis is over, mom. Let's go home.

01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:03.032
Good

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:06.702
I'm so proud of you both.

01:11:57.646 --> 01:12:00.607
