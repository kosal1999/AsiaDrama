00:09.009 --> 00:11.428
EMERGENCIES

00:18.935 --> 00:20.311
Give me a sedative.

00:20.395 --> 00:21.312
What do we do ?

00:21.396 --> 00:23.815
- Calm down, wait.
- My mother is not well.

00:23.898 --> 00:24.983
How long ?

00:25.692 --> 00:27.986
She didn't sleep all night.

00:28.069 --> 00:30.572
We'll take care of her, just wait a bit.

00:31.740 --> 00:34.242
Let it pass.

00:37.829 --> 00:40.081
Doctor, please...

00:40.165 --> 00:43.001
Clear the way!

00:43.084 --> 00:46.546
Stay with me. Keep your eyes open!

01:10.236 --> 01:11.821
- THANKS.
- You are welcome.

01:19.037 --> 01:20.288
Maman.

01:36.304 --> 01:37.555
I'm sorry.

01:45.772 --> 01:46.606
Let's go.

02:27.355 --> 02:30.733
THE HUNT IN THE BLOOD

02:32.152 --> 02:34.112
- Mr. An Mun-ju?
- Yes.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.579
Fortunately, the nerves are intact.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.832
An operation for the scar?

02:45.915 --> 02:48.626
We closed the wound,

02:48.710 --> 02:52.422
but you have to have surgery quickly,
or it might show.

02:52.505 --> 02:53.590
It's expensive, no ?

02:53.673 --> 02:55.425
I know a specialist.

02:56.384 --> 02:59.637
Here, look.
This is a recent operation.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.849
- Do you see the scar on his forehead?
- Yes.

03:02.932 --> 03:05.268
That was before the laser surgery.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.437
This is the result afterwards.

03:07.520 --> 03:08.396
I see.

03:08.479 --> 03:10.773
A scar on your face, at your age.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.568
It would be better to have surgery.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.655
No it'll be fine. THANKS.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.576
Choi Han-seon?

03:22.493 --> 03:23.703
Come in.

03:23.786 --> 03:24.621
Woo-jin.

03:28.833 --> 03:29.667
How are you ?

03:31.294 --> 03:32.420
Show me.

03:32.503 --> 03:33.504
Non.

03:33.588 --> 03:34.589
Show me.

03:42.096 --> 03:43.348
Whore !

03:46.976 --> 03:48.269
How many points?

03:49.187 --> 03:50.146
Thirty.

03:50.230 --> 03:54.025
Damn, bastards. It pisses me off.

03:56.194 --> 03:57.612
It should be reported.

03:59.489 --> 04:02.242
Notify the police and your mother will be there.

04:08.164 --> 04:10.083
- I can't.
- For what ?

04:10.166 --> 04:12.252
It would put my mother in danger.

04:13.711 --> 04:15.171
Damn, seriously?

04:15.964 --> 04:17.548
And if not, the contract?

04:19.300 --> 04:21.511
So look.

04:22.178 --> 04:25.098
I have never seen that.
“Loan Extension Fees”.

04:25.181 --> 04:29.394
You pay 10% of the capital every week
until you repay the loan.

04:29.477 --> 04:32.981
Your mother borrowed 50 million,
so five million in fees.

04:33.064 --> 04:35.358
And if you miss the deadline, it doubles.

04:35.441 --> 04:37.819
The interest rate increases from 5% to 20%.

04:37.902 --> 04:41.155
They wrote it
in the fine print, the bastards.

04:41.239 --> 04:43.992
A scam.
Your mother couldn't have known that.

04:44.075 --> 04:45.076
What do I do ?

04:45.159 --> 04:47.078
Pay them back immediately.

04:47.161 --> 04:50.123
If the interest goes up,
they'll seize your house.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.166
We don't have the money.

04:53.543 --> 04:56.296
Damn, piss off.

05:03.219 --> 05:04.178
Let's go to lunch.

05:04.262 --> 05:06.180
What do you want ? I invite you.

05:09.434 --> 05:10.393
He has steak.

05:11.352 --> 05:13.688
You haven't lost your sense of humor.

05:14.355 --> 05:15.773
Really, steak.

05:16.983 --> 05:17.859
Bon.

05:19.068 --> 05:21.738
How do you like sautéed pork?
It's worth a steak.

05:23.865 --> 05:24.741
All right.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.329
I come here after training.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.331
I have my little routine.

05:31.414 --> 05:34.459
Don't say anything and enjoy, understand?

05:34.542 --> 05:37.086
- Understood.
- Hi !

05:37.170 --> 05:39.213
Happy to see you.

05:39.297 --> 05:41.049
- Wow !
- We are two.

05:41.132 --> 05:42.967
A new friend ?

05:43.051 --> 05:44.844
- Good morning.
- A boxer friend.

05:44.927 --> 05:46.179
Really ?

05:51.893 --> 05:53.061
I have to answer.

05:54.645 --> 05:58.691
Hello, this is Woo-jin. How are you ?

05:59.901 --> 06:01.486
I wanted to talk to you...

06:08.368 --> 06:09.952
GUN-WOO

06:11.454 --> 06:12.497
Yes, Gun-woo?

06:13.081 --> 06:14.916
Woo-jin read the contract.

06:14.999 --> 06:18.544
They are professional scammers.
We got screwed.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.046
It's not your fault.

06:20.129 --> 06:21.714
Thank you honey.

06:23.299 --> 06:25.968
What did they say about your cheek?

06:26.719 --> 06:28.429
It heals well.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.348
<i>What a relief!</i>

06:31.391 --> 06:33.518
I'll clean the cafe with Woo-Jin.

06:33.601 --> 06:35.520
<i>Stay home and rest.</i>

06:37.021 --> 06:40.608
No, I'm going to clean up. Do not worry.

06:40.691 --> 06:43.653
It's nothing, I'll take care of it when I get home.

06:43.736 --> 06:45.238
It's ready !

06:48.658 --> 06:51.828
I call you later.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.663
<i>- Okay.</i>
- See you later.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.964
Come on, help me out on this one.

07:03.047 --> 07:05.341
It's for a friend, not for me.

07:05.842 --> 07:07.885
I will reimburse you on time.

07:07.969 --> 07:09.512
Everything will be fine.

07:10.054 --> 07:13.808
2% interest? Might as well go to the bank.

07:13.891 --> 07:17.937
Do it to me at 1%.
I beg you. Just this once.

07:18.521 --> 07:20.690
He's a very good friend.

07:22.024 --> 07:23.192
Help me out.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.736
I collected a lot of money for you

07:26.279 --> 07:28.281
and I never asked you anything.

07:58.019 --> 07:59.979
You had to call me.

08:00.062 --> 08:01.647
She just brought it.

08:02.523 --> 08:03.524
Taste.

08:03.608 --> 08:06.068
The best pork stir-fry in the country.

08:12.950 --> 08:14.619
SO ? Enjoy your food.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.925
GO TO THE OFFICE, WE’RE GOING TO CHAT

08:29.008 --> 08:32.303
He's angry,
so don't get into trouble.

08:32.803 --> 08:34.138
Let me talk.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.056
All right.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.560
- Mr. Seo?
- Yes ?

08:39.644 --> 08:41.020
How much is that worth?

08:41.687 --> 08:43.397
About 20 million won.

08:43.481 --> 08:45.942
Hi ! It's me, Woo-jin!

08:47.401 --> 08:52.073
You have some nerve. You disappear for years,
and you come back asking for money.

08:52.156 --> 08:54.575
Do you think I'm happy to see you?

08:55.076 --> 08:56.911
- Sorry.
- Stopped.

08:56.994 --> 08:58.037
Come on !

08:58.120 --> 09:00.164
Poor bastard!

09:01.040 --> 09:02.333
- Sit down.
- Yes.

09:08.464 --> 09:11.551
How did your friend get into debt?

09:11.634 --> 09:14.637
He got scammed by Smile Capital.

09:15.221 --> 09:18.057
Smile Capital ?
Les types de Gwangan-dong ?

09:18.683 --> 09:20.101
I don't know where they are from.

09:20.893 --> 09:22.228
Whore.

09:23.145 --> 09:26.023
Smile Capital is not amateurs.

09:26.107 --> 09:27.608
It's a big box.

09:28.109 --> 09:30.820
- How much do you owe them?
- One hundred million.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.071
Whore.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.076
You're in trouble.

09:37.159 --> 09:39.078
Exactly, help us.

09:39.161 --> 09:40.580
You're loaded with cash.

09:44.166 --> 09:47.420
I'll give you a loan at 1%
repayable over one year.

09:49.505 --> 09:51.007
Thank you so much.

09:53.134 --> 09:56.095
In exchange, come back and work for me.

09:56.178 --> 09:58.848
With the pandemic, business is taking off.

09:58.931 --> 10:01.183
You have to take advantage of it to enrich yourself.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.060
Come back and help me.

10:03.144 --> 10:06.480
You will receive a good bonus
on each recovery.

10:08.149 --> 10:10.443
Damn, you're taking me by surprise.

10:10.526 --> 10:11.652
Whore.

10:11.736 --> 10:14.155
A year of collecting debts for me.

10:15.072 --> 10:17.283
I'm offering you an opportunity.

10:17.366 --> 10:19.827
You can make golden balls.

10:20.328 --> 10:22.872
You'll never get that much money.

10:22.955 --> 10:26.500
I see what you mean,
but I wasn't expecting that.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.462
- Make a decision.
- Here we go.

10:31.213 --> 10:32.048
Quoi ?

10:32.131 --> 10:34.383
Would that mean beating people up?

10:36.469 --> 10:39.263
We're not scum.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.599
We are boxers.

10:44.018 --> 10:44.977
Petit.

10:45.645 --> 10:50.274
If you don't pay back Smile Capital,
they will kill you and sell your organs.

11:02.536 --> 11:03.579
What are you doing ?

11:03.663 --> 11:07.083
Thank you for everything.
I'll come back another time.

11:08.209 --> 11:09.043
Let's go.

11:09.835 --> 11:11.504
Are you kidding me ?

11:14.006 --> 11:15.216
You calm down.

11:24.725 --> 11:26.018
I'm kidding.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.688
See you next time.

11:31.524 --> 11:32.483
Come on, let's go.

11:35.903 --> 11:37.905
Whore !

11:39.365 --> 11:40.366
Hey, boxer.

11:47.039 --> 11:48.874
- Stamp here.
- All right.

11:50.167 --> 11:53.462
If business takes off,
don't forget our part.

11:53.546 --> 11:56.132
Thank you so much.

12:01.470 --> 12:02.930
- Good job.
- Started.

13:11.957 --> 13:14.627
- No problem, I hope?
- No sir.

13:15.127 --> 13:17.338
GOOD. Hold.

13:17.421 --> 13:19.590
Money raised today.

13:20.966 --> 13:25.596
We collect homeless people's papers
all over the city.

13:25.679 --> 13:27.181
Who are you ?

13:27.264 --> 13:29.433
What do you want ? Get back to work.

13:29.517 --> 13:30.434
Pardon.

13:31.894 --> 13:36.524
We will do everything to bring you
the required amount as soon as possible.

13:39.693 --> 13:41.237
This week ?

13:41.320 --> 13:43.322
I'll do my best.

13:43.405 --> 13:46.075
KIM JUN-MIN

13:49.870 --> 13:51.664
WEARING A MASK MANDATORY

13:56.627 --> 13:59.713
I didn't
keep you waiting too long, I hope.

13:59.797 --> 14:02.591
DREAM ON CAPITAL

14:02.675 --> 14:04.760
Why don't you have a mask?

14:05.511 --> 14:06.345
I put it.

14:06.428 --> 14:10.182
I'm not asking you to put it on,
but why you took it off.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.434
We've been waiting for 30 minutes.

14:12.518 --> 14:13.519
I was suffocating.

14:13.602 --> 14:17.523
You little bastard, you have no patience
and you want to be a bodyguard?

14:17.606 --> 14:20.818
Wearing a mask has nothing to do with it!

14:20.901 --> 14:21.735
Cleared.

14:23.070 --> 14:24.363
Go away !

14:26.073 --> 14:26.949
Shit.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.036
What a little shit!

14:32.663 --> 14:34.248
Whore !

14:35.833 --> 14:38.002
- You took off your mask.
- No.

14:38.085 --> 14:38.919
I saw you.

14:39.503 --> 14:40.796
I had lowered it.

14:40.880 --> 14:44.258
It's the same.
Take some responsibility for your mistakes. Out !

14:45.301 --> 14:46.135
Go out !

14:46.218 --> 14:47.928
Whore.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.307
"Putain" ?

14:51.807 --> 14:53.893
"Putain" ?

14:53.976 --> 14:55.394
I'm hallucinating.

14:58.606 --> 14:59.648
Your mask.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.112
What's your name ?

15:05.696 --> 15:06.780
Cheon Dong-woo.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.198
I see. Size ?

15:08.282 --> 15:10.242
1.87 m. I weigh 74 kg.

15:10.868 --> 15:14.288
- Do you do sports ?
- Ten years of kickboxing and hapkido.

15:14.371 --> 15:17.499
- Diploma ?
- Security at Yongheon University.

15:20.294 --> 15:23.255
Hey ! The total !

15:23.339 --> 15:25.299
- The army?
- I was exempted.

15:26.383 --> 15:28.427
Following a sports injury.

15:29.428 --> 15:30.262
Too bad.

15:32.014 --> 15:32.848
Bye.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.767
Why are you rejecting me?

15:35.517 --> 15:38.228
- I'm looking for a marine.
- A marine, obliged?

15:38.312 --> 15:40.147
Oui.

15:40.648 --> 15:44.193
Whore. You could have
mentioned it in the ad.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.362
What, “damn”?

15:46.445 --> 15:50.991
- You wasted my time!
- A little respect for your elders.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.284
Fuck you.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.954
You just had to not piss off...

15:58.374 --> 16:00.167
You're going to leave now.

16:00.751 --> 16:01.585
All right !

16:04.129 --> 16:07.049
MARINE
IF YOU CAN’T GET IT, PERSEVERE!

16:11.220 --> 16:13.138
HONG WOO-JIN - 1 216E PROMO

16:23.315 --> 16:24.274
Come over here.

16:25.734 --> 16:26.902
Why do we run?

16:26.986 --> 16:28.529
He's a senior marine!

16:31.865 --> 16:35.536
A single man in Korea
can transfer a trillion won

16:35.619 --> 16:37.579
with a single phone call.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.540
Bang Seong-ho.

16:41.667 --> 16:45.004
And only one man knows
what Mr. Bang looks like.

16:45.087 --> 16:48.424
- And only you know who this man is?
- Shut up.

16:49.341 --> 16:52.594
Mr. Bang only ever took
one person under his tutelage.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.096
M. Choi.

16:54.179 --> 16:58.600
It's thanks to him that I earn my living.

16:58.684 --> 17:01.103
Do you see the blackboard ?

17:01.186 --> 17:02.229
- Yes.
- Yes.

17:02.312 --> 17:04.523
Good. Alright.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.735
Mr. Choi wants to hire someone.

17:07.818 --> 17:11.780
Someone who would be willing to risk their life
to save someone.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.198
Someone generous.

17:13.282 --> 17:17.286
Someone who knows our business.

17:17.369 --> 17:21.623
Yesterday I started
looking for candidates,

17:21.707 --> 17:23.834
but none suited.

17:23.917 --> 17:27.796
It was at this very moment
that a young marine called me.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.715
Talk about a coincidence!

17:31.091 --> 17:33.677
He's a marine too,
from a previous class.

17:34.261 --> 17:35.137
Those promos?

17:35.220 --> 17:36.722
La 1 207e.

17:36.805 --> 17:38.974
I'm from the 734th class.

17:40.267 --> 17:43.437
- Did you see ?
- It's nice to see !

17:43.520 --> 17:46.607
I will recommend you to Mr. Choi.

17:47.691 --> 17:50.527
- Write down your identity number.
- Sir.

17:51.987 --> 17:55.699
Actually, you were contacted
to borrow money.

17:56.325 --> 17:59.536
That's why
I refer you to Mr. Choi.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.705
He is as fierce as a tiger,

18:01.789 --> 18:04.792
but understanding and generous.

18:04.875 --> 18:09.296
If he takes a liking to you,
he will take care of you like a marine!

18:10.005 --> 18:11.340
Is he a marine?

18:12.758 --> 18:14.343
What if he's a marine?

18:14.426 --> 18:15.511
Oui.

18:17.387 --> 18:20.140
He was exempted
because he was out of school.

18:21.517 --> 18:23.644
Yes, well, so to speak.

18:23.727 --> 18:27.981
I said "navy" to mean "cool",
like rappers say "hip-hop".

18:30.567 --> 18:34.071
What are you talking about ?
Write your ID number.

18:34.613 --> 18:35.447
All right.

18:42.287 --> 18:45.707
Did you see his face?
I think it looks good.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.668
- THANKS.
- Let's go.

18:47.751 --> 18:49.670
You don't have to thank me.

18:50.337 --> 18:52.464
How many were your attackers?

18:53.549 --> 18:54.550
About ten.

18:55.509 --> 18:58.303
- But it was someone else who beat me.
- Only one?

18:58.804 --> 19:02.182
A real mirror cabinet.
He headbutted me.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.601
Hard to dodge, that.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.564
Say, if ever

19:09.523 --> 19:12.651
you have to collect debts
to pay yours,

19:12.734 --> 19:13.735
what will you do ?

19:19.491 --> 19:21.285
We will advise together.

19:34.631 --> 19:37.885
Good job, as always. THANKS.

19:38.385 --> 19:41.430
No, we'll take care of it.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.724
This is Mr. Oh's specialty.

19:44.266 --> 19:45.392
All right.

19:45.475 --> 19:50.189
We just have to go to Yang-jung's for lunch
one of these days. See you soon.

19:53.275 --> 19:56.570
Yang Jae-myeong went
to Chungjeong-ro and Myeong-dong

19:56.653 --> 19:59.573
borrow 400 million
from seven different loan sharks.

20:00.240 --> 20:03.911
He gave everything to an executive
at Smile Capital in Gwangan-dong.

20:04.912 --> 20:05.871
You know him ?

20:07.331 --> 20:08.916
His face doesn't tell me anything.

20:08.999 --> 20:12.961
He impersonates homeless people
to create shell companies

20:13.545 --> 20:15.547
and borrow from loan sharks.

20:15.631 --> 20:17.382
The moneylenders accept,

20:17.466 --> 20:21.511
because they do not communicate with each other
and suspect nothing.

20:22.095 --> 20:25.766
They only notice it
when they collect the money.

20:25.849 --> 20:29.436
Whoever designed this plan
knows the inner workings of the industry well.

20:29.519 --> 20:32.814
It seems
that Yang Jae-myeong is just a pawn.

20:33.732 --> 20:35.359
How do you know all this?

20:35.943 --> 20:38.362
It was in 2001 or 2002.

20:38.445 --> 20:41.573
A fake volunteer
at a clinic for the disabled

20:41.657 --> 20:43.992
stole their identity papers.

20:44.493 --> 20:47.329
He created a shell company
to take out a loan

20:47.412 --> 20:52.000
the seven billion won
from the moneylenders of Myeong-dong,

20:52.084 --> 20:53.877
before fleeing to the Philippines.

20:54.419 --> 20:56.088
A fortune at the time.

20:57.631 --> 20:59.132
Are we going to let them do it?

20:59.216 --> 21:00.384
Quoi ?

21:00.467 --> 21:03.136
These loan sharks are being scammed.

21:03.220 --> 21:04.930
They're a bit like your colleagues.

21:05.013 --> 21:06.848
They will get through this.

21:07.432 --> 21:10.185
Loan sharks
cannot file a complaint.

21:11.103 --> 21:15.148
Hyeon-ju,
it's up to them to sort this out.

21:16.483 --> 21:19.444
I am no longer part of this environment.

21:20.028 --> 21:21.571
Not for ten years.

21:23.031 --> 21:27.244
Was
the guy who fled to the Philippines caught?

21:27.327 --> 21:32.124
His victims sent henchmen
after him in the Philippines.

21:32.624 --> 21:33.583
He is dead ?

21:37.713 --> 21:39.172
It's brutal.

21:39.715 --> 21:40.882
Hyeon-ju.

21:40.966 --> 21:43.510
I can hire someone to help you.

21:44.094 --> 21:45.595
Especially not.

21:45.679 --> 21:48.473
It's dangerous.
The proof is that you got hurt.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.309
It's just a scratch.

21:50.392 --> 21:51.268
Anyway.

21:51.351 --> 21:53.895
I'm more efficient on my own.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.063
Rest.

21:56.815 --> 21:57.733
Dirty brat!

22:02.154 --> 22:03.071
Nice shot !

22:04.197 --> 22:07.242
Sir, why
did you disfigure this young man?

22:14.291 --> 22:15.500
Who told you about it?

22:15.584 --> 22:17.627
I asked In-beom.

22:18.420 --> 22:19.838
Beom talking about all this?

22:20.714 --> 22:23.091
- Just me.
- Wait, I'm finished.

22:27.262 --> 22:29.056
- Not bad.
- Nice shot.

22:32.476 --> 22:35.145
He spat in my face
in front of the men.

22:36.813 --> 22:38.482
I made an example of it.

22:39.858 --> 22:41.943
It makes me extra work.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.158
Jang-do.

22:49.242 --> 22:51.661
Sometimes you have to take the lead.

22:51.745 --> 22:53.497
Instill fear.

22:54.664 --> 22:55.499
Oui.

22:57.459 --> 22:59.878
This rich kid didn't call me back.

22:59.961 --> 23:01.338
It has been a week.

23:01.838 --> 23:05.634
I will arrange a meeting
to convince him to support us.

23:06.343 --> 23:07.177
Alright.

23:25.112 --> 23:27.322
APPLICATION FOR THE 38TH BEGINNERS TOURNAMENT

23:28.615 --> 23:31.785
Hey,
he really has an athletic body.

23:31.868 --> 23:34.746
Weren't you a boxer, too?

23:34.830 --> 23:37.165
Not at this level.

23:37.833 --> 23:40.961
This body proves
his determination and seriousness.

23:41.044 --> 23:43.296
Looks don't lie.

23:43.380 --> 23:44.589
It's true.

23:45.215 --> 23:49.302
But he knows nothing
about money lending.

23:51.847 --> 23:52.722
Merci.

23:52.806 --> 23:55.892
This is Kim Gun-woo's new friend.

23:55.976 --> 23:57.436
According to the investigator,

23:58.520 --> 24:01.398
he had busted gangsters in Incheon

24:01.481 --> 24:03.567
and set out to escape them.

24:04.067 --> 24:05.777
No more gaps since.

24:05.861 --> 24:09.489
He worked for loan sharks,
he knows the business.

24:10.615 --> 24:13.827
I think it would be good
to hire them both.

24:15.704 --> 24:18.665
- Let's start by seeing Gun-woo.
- Alright.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.292
It's here.

24:24.171 --> 24:26.047
SUSHI

24:31.470 --> 24:32.429
Bonjour.

24:32.512 --> 24:33.346
Bonjour.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.308
Mr. Moon sent you, right?

24:36.391 --> 24:37.350
Oui.

24:39.394 --> 24:40.437
After you.

24:47.027 --> 24:48.320
- Go for it.
- Me ?

24:48.820 --> 24:49.654
Oui.

25:28.693 --> 25:30.612
Hello, I'm Kim Gun-woo.

25:31.947 --> 25:32.781
Sit down.

25:32.864 --> 25:33.698
All right.

25:42.415 --> 25:44.751
I can refer to you informally ?

25:45.627 --> 25:46.461
Yes sir.

25:52.592 --> 25:54.344
Did you hurt your cheek?

25:54.928 --> 25:59.349
Yes, trying to stop loan sharks
from trashing my mother's cafe.

26:02.143 --> 26:04.312
I was a loan shark myself.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.900
It's been a while since I stopped.

26:09.484 --> 26:10.360
All right.

26:10.443 --> 26:14.030
Now I offer zero interest loans

26:15.115 --> 26:17.409
to pay for the care of sick people.

26:17.993 --> 26:18.827
I see.

26:21.871 --> 26:23.456
I have work for you.

26:24.833 --> 26:28.295
I'm teaching the ropes
to a young person.

26:28.962 --> 26:30.046
All right.

26:30.130 --> 26:31.923
We are not related.

26:33.466 --> 26:36.720
- But I don't have any other family.
- I see.

26:36.803 --> 26:40.599
I'm afraid that working alone,
something will happen to her.

26:41.891 --> 26:46.313
So I'm looking for someone good
to ensure their safety.

26:48.565 --> 26:52.819
- I wouldn't have to recover any money?
- No, it's not about that.

26:54.487 --> 26:57.449
- You would be a bodyguard.
- I see. All right !

27:00.243 --> 27:03.038
At the risk of offending you,

27:03.788 --> 27:05.915
I found out about you.

27:05.999 --> 27:07.959
No, that doesn't offend me at all.

27:08.043 --> 27:11.546
Even in difficult times,
you showed kindness

27:12.547 --> 27:14.507
and determination.

27:14.591 --> 27:18.720
Now that I've met you,
I see that you have a frank outlook.

27:21.973 --> 27:24.184
- You are trustworthy.
- THANKS.

27:32.734 --> 27:36.446
- Why do you box?
- As a child, I wanted to be strong.

27:37.030 --> 27:37.864
For what ?

27:38.740 --> 27:41.368
My father never resisted alcohol.

27:42.369 --> 27:44.954
It got complicated
when I entered college.

27:45.038 --> 27:47.540
He started drinking and hitting my mother.

27:48.124 --> 27:51.294
I was just a kid,
it motivated me to become strong.

27:54.089 --> 27:56.466
- Does he live with you?
- No.

27:57.008 --> 28:00.387
They divorced,
I haven't seen him since I was 16.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.932
- I come from the countryside.
- I see.

28:04.015 --> 28:07.394
My father was a sharecropper.

28:07.477 --> 28:08.353
I see.

28:09.104 --> 28:13.191
I have a very clear memory
of the year I was ten.

28:13.775 --> 28:16.986
There had been a famine
and poor harvests.

28:17.070 --> 28:18.988
We couldn't pay our rent,

28:19.614 --> 28:21.950
and the owner sent his men

28:23.034 --> 28:24.911
beating my father...

28:27.414 --> 28:29.582
in front of the whole village.

28:30.750 --> 28:33.795
My father was
seriously injured in the head.

28:33.878 --> 28:36.506
but we didn't have
enough to pay for the hospital.

28:38.258 --> 28:40.427
He died suffering martyrdom.

28:41.094 --> 28:44.347
This is what motivated me to become rich.

28:44.931 --> 28:48.017
I decided to help people

28:49.477 --> 28:51.813
who do not have the means to care for themselves.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.697
What I mean,

29:00.780 --> 29:06.369
it is that a generous heart
can overcome all obstacles.

29:06.453 --> 29:09.831
Yes, I always try to be generous.

29:15.879 --> 29:17.297
You're not a good talker.

29:17.380 --> 29:20.800
Pardon. Talking is not my strong suit.

29:20.884 --> 29:23.052
- Oh no?
- Not.

29:28.099 --> 29:29.601
- Come.
- I'm coming.

29:31.311 --> 29:32.145
SO ?

29:33.605 --> 29:34.814
It was, I think.

29:35.315 --> 29:37.901
I mostly let Mr. Choi do the talking.

29:37.984 --> 29:40.528
I told you it would go well!

29:42.238 --> 29:43.239
You see ?

29:44.407 --> 29:45.658
SO ?

29:46.242 --> 29:48.620
He has no sense of humor.

29:51.372 --> 29:52.582
But he has a good background.

29:54.918 --> 29:55.752
I see.

29:59.839 --> 30:00.924
Attention.

30:03.343 --> 30:07.013
He needs money.
Take care of it by tonight.

30:07.096 --> 30:08.181
All right.

30:08.890 --> 30:11.976
- Help me some. Not too much.
- Eat well.

30:17.273 --> 30:22.153
- It's not much, but hey.
- Madam, I love kimchi stew.

30:22.237 --> 30:23.571
I can taste ?

30:23.655 --> 30:24.739
Yes of course.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.995
- Be careful, it's hot.
- It's too good. THANKS.

30:31.079 --> 30:32.747
Enjoy your food.

30:34.082 --> 30:39.003
In any case,
it's nice of you to help us.

30:39.087 --> 30:42.465
It's all natural.
Your son is a very good friend.

30:43.550 --> 30:44.926
And we are marines!

30:45.510 --> 30:47.303
Everything will be alright.

30:48.680 --> 30:49.806
Merci.

30:49.889 --> 30:51.307
Eat, it'll get cold.

30:51.391 --> 30:53.059
- All right !
- Enjoy your food.

30:53.142 --> 30:53.977
Enjoy your food.

30:56.062 --> 30:56.896
Who is it ?

30:58.314 --> 30:59.315
I will see.

31:00.275 --> 31:01.359
Who is it ?

31:04.445 --> 31:06.114
Yes, can I help you?

31:06.197 --> 31:08.074
I work for Mr. Choi.

31:08.825 --> 31:09.742
I see.

31:13.162 --> 31:14.455
Delighted.

31:14.539 --> 31:16.749
Hold. One hundred million won.

31:17.333 --> 31:20.461
- What ?
- Two years of salary in advance.

31:22.672 --> 31:23.590
More...

31:31.014 --> 31:32.932
You start tomorrow at 10 a.m.

31:33.016 --> 31:35.643
I will text you the address.

31:40.148 --> 31:43.526
Thank you very much sir.

31:44.527 --> 31:46.863
Instead, thank Mr. Choi.

31:46.946 --> 31:48.197
- Yes.
- I go.

31:49.157 --> 31:50.700
Thanks again.

32:17.644 --> 32:19.437
Excellent, this omelette.

32:20.063 --> 32:21.439
I can do it again.

32:24.108 --> 32:25.109
Who was it ?

32:27.862 --> 32:29.030
Hey well...

32:31.824 --> 32:33.993
Mom, I didn't tell you,

32:34.077 --> 32:37.455
but an acquaintance of Woo-jin
found me a job.

32:37.538 --> 32:38.414
Work ?

32:38.998 --> 32:43.378
Bodyguard for someone
in the family of a wealthy businessman.

32:44.545 --> 32:46.798
I made a good impression.

32:46.881 --> 32:49.258
He gave me an advance on my salary.

32:49.342 --> 32:50.301
Cent millions.

32:54.138 --> 32:55.932
- Really ?
- Yes.

32:56.015 --> 33:00.311
Let's start by paying off our debt
to prevent it from increasing.

33:08.695 --> 33:11.531
I feel like
I'm mortgaging your future.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.492
But no, mom.

33:16.202 --> 33:19.497
The main thing
is that we are both happy.

33:19.580 --> 33:21.290
I will continue to train.

33:21.374 --> 33:24.210
I will resume boxing
after the pandemic. It'll be fine.

33:26.629 --> 33:28.464
I'm sorry.

33:33.720 --> 33:37.056
Smile, mom. It's good news.

33:45.273 --> 33:46.441
Merci, Woo-jin.

34:08.337 --> 34:09.797
- Good evening.
- Pushes you.

34:09.881 --> 34:11.007
Come see.

34:12.967 --> 34:13.801
Quoi ?

34:14.635 --> 34:16.929
- He's already here.
- He's ahead.

34:17.013 --> 34:19.182
Is he the son of the CEO of Iil Group?

34:19.766 --> 34:21.434
- You know him ?
- My heart.

34:21.517 --> 34:23.603
- Beware of him.
- For what ?

34:23.686 --> 34:25.438
- Say!
- I'm coming.

34:26.856 --> 34:30.401
Do you have wipes?
I rang the bell, no one answered.

34:30.485 --> 34:32.570
Sorry, I brought this to you.

34:32.653 --> 34:36.657
When I was manager at Speed,
he fought the owner.

34:36.741 --> 34:37.992
Hyeon-ji ?

34:38.076 --> 34:38.993
Oui.

34:39.077 --> 34:41.662
A drunken argument about politics.

34:41.746 --> 34:45.166
The following week,
we were subject to a tax audit.

34:45.750 --> 34:48.294
She had to sell her house to pay them.

34:48.795 --> 34:52.090
Later, we learned
that he had friends everywhere.

34:52.173 --> 34:56.761
Tax authorities, police, Ministry of Finance...
His family is everywhere.

34:56.844 --> 34:58.554
Like all rich people.

34:59.222 --> 35:00.056
Really ?

35:00.556 --> 35:03.059
She will have insulted
one of her politician cousins.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.730
I worry about you.

35:09.232 --> 35:10.149
Go ahead.

35:10.900 --> 35:12.527
Did you order girls?

35:13.444 --> 35:14.946
He advised us against it.

35:17.990 --> 35:19.700
Good. Do not worry.

35:21.994 --> 35:23.204
He is accompanied.

35:23.287 --> 35:25.331
- Who ?
- A former member of the academy.

35:28.709 --> 35:29.919
Is he still a cop?

35:30.002 --> 35:32.421
Yes, he was first in his class.

35:35.299 --> 35:36.425
Does he know who you are?

35:37.844 --> 35:40.221
No. We were several years apart.

35:46.727 --> 35:49.605
Whatever happens,
don't intervene, understand?

35:50.273 --> 35:51.107
Oui.

35:55.236 --> 35:56.946
I'll tell them to call.

36:00.825 --> 36:01.784
Good evening.

36:02.493 --> 36:03.452
Here you are.

36:04.662 --> 36:07.540
He's a cousin of mine.

36:07.623 --> 36:09.584
Min Gang-yong, delighted.

36:09.667 --> 36:11.294
I like your voice.

36:11.377 --> 36:12.587
Kim Myeong-gil.

36:12.670 --> 36:15.339
He mentioned alcohol,
so I joined in.

36:15.423 --> 36:16.424
Does it bother you ?

36:16.507 --> 36:19.177
It seems you have big plans.

36:19.260 --> 36:21.095
- Delighted.
- Me too.

36:21.971 --> 36:24.724
This is Lee Jin-su, an associate of mine.

36:25.308 --> 36:28.603
Delighted. I've
seen you somewhere before, right?

36:28.686 --> 36:32.023
I have an all-purpose face, that's all.

36:33.399 --> 36:34.901
- Sit down.
- THANKS.

36:37.695 --> 36:40.531
I brought this
so I wouldn't drink at your expense.

36:41.157 --> 36:42.450
You should not have.

36:46.495 --> 36:47.371
I serve you ?

36:52.793 --> 36:55.046
Excuse him, he doesn't drink.

36:55.129 --> 36:58.174
Just one sober person
complicates things.

36:58.257 --> 37:02.595
Sharing a drink
helps prevent you from changing your mind later.

37:02.678 --> 37:07.225
So drink his share like a loyal friend.
I bet you handle alcohol well.

37:07.308 --> 37:08.684
I appreciate loyalty.

37:10.269 --> 37:11.562
Go for a second one.

37:25.576 --> 37:27.286
You drink it like water.

37:27.787 --> 37:30.414
- It's going well, isn't it?
- Yes.

37:30.915 --> 37:32.458
My turn to serve you.

37:33.834 --> 37:35.002
A small glass ?

37:35.920 --> 37:38.130
A big glass, you mean.

37:38.214 --> 37:40.007
- I'll take this.
- GOOD.

37:42.593 --> 37:43.928
Hey !

37:44.011 --> 37:48.474
With my colleagues, we thrive on <i>soju,</i>
so if someone offers me good whiskey,

37:48.557 --> 37:49.809
I take advantage of it!

37:57.233 --> 37:58.484
It's up to me to serve you.

38:26.929 --> 38:28.472
What a descent!

38:29.056 --> 38:32.018
I want some too.
It's my whiskey, after all.

38:32.852 --> 38:33.686
Non ?

38:34.312 --> 38:36.480
I serve you. I can refer to you informally ?

38:41.193 --> 38:42.111
You go-y.

38:56.667 --> 38:57.752
Trinquons.

39:04.800 --> 39:05.801
Hey !

39:07.011 --> 39:07.845
Come on !

39:09.430 --> 39:10.264
Dry ass!

39:24.779 --> 39:26.614
You have quite a descent.

39:26.697 --> 39:30.284
Gang-yong, if alcohol
makes me do something stupid, stop me.

39:30.368 --> 39:31.994
If it gets out of hand...

39:32.078 --> 39:33.746
Where did I put them?

39:38.167 --> 39:39.502
I will arrest someone.

39:45.925 --> 39:47.176
Pass your drinks.

40:04.777 --> 40:05.736
Whore.

40:07.113 --> 40:12.118
Now that we've had a drink together,
let's put our cards on the table.

40:13.119 --> 40:14.036
Alright.

40:15.830 --> 40:16.747
You are rich ?

40:16.831 --> 40:19.417
I come from a modest background,
I work hard.

40:21.127 --> 40:22.211
Do you have 100 billion?

40:23.421 --> 40:26.590
I never lie
when it comes to money.

40:26.674 --> 40:28.259
Never ?

40:29.802 --> 40:31.220
It's strange.

40:31.303 --> 40:36.934
I was told that even if I looked hard,
Smile Capital didn't have 50 billion.

40:37.017 --> 40:38.561
It's true.

40:38.644 --> 40:41.355
The tax authorities must not be doing their job well.

40:41.439 --> 40:42.731
We call them ?

40:43.691 --> 40:45.151
Be careful, you're drunk.

40:45.234 --> 40:47.945
Mr. Kim looks upset, apologize to him.

40:48.571 --> 40:49.655
Oh sorry.

40:50.239 --> 40:54.785
I shouldn't have drunk on an empty stomach,
the alcohol is going to my head.

40:55.369 --> 40:57.538
Don't worry about the money.

40:59.123 --> 41:00.207
Oh no?

41:00.875 --> 41:01.917
If you say so.

41:02.877 --> 41:05.629
I never worry about money.

41:08.257 --> 41:12.136
Hey, my mother asked me
to say hello to Mr. Bang.

41:12.970 --> 41:14.805
She thanks him again.

41:16.056 --> 41:18.601
But the man
who brought him the money...

41:22.229 --> 41:24.356
He was already in his forties.

41:25.483 --> 41:29.570
It's been 20 years, and you haven't aged.
What's your secret?

41:30.696 --> 41:31.947
Un lifting ?

41:33.574 --> 41:35.117
It's fashionable.

41:38.704 --> 41:41.749
Did you think I wouldn't tell him about it?

41:41.832 --> 41:43.250
Well then?

41:43.334 --> 41:44.877
You do not say anything anymore ?

41:45.503 --> 41:49.548
Are you the type to shut up
as soon as you lose the advantage?

41:52.468 --> 41:54.678
Is that what they taught you in prison?

41:58.057 --> 41:59.642
I'm hallucinating, he's laughing.

41:59.725 --> 42:01.852
That's it, smile.

42:03.479 --> 42:05.648
Putain, Gang-yong!

42:06.273 --> 42:09.443
I don't want to drink anymore. Let's get this over with.

42:10.569 --> 42:11.612
Listen, Kim.

42:12.238 --> 42:13.989
I'll put in the 100 billion.

42:14.740 --> 42:17.034
This is the last time we see each other.

42:19.078 --> 42:20.162
Come on, my little Kim.

42:22.289 --> 42:23.624
Come on, come here.

42:34.426 --> 42:38.347
If you attack my family again,

42:40.182 --> 42:41.392
you are dead.

42:47.439 --> 42:48.315
Understood ?

42:52.444 --> 42:56.198
You really lived!
You even have a scar.

42:56.282 --> 42:57.741
I told you !

42:57.825 --> 42:58.826
Lets' go.

42:58.909 --> 43:01.453
Let's go. We stayed too long.

43:01.537 --> 43:04.415
I tried
to give you the benefit of the doubt.

43:04.498 --> 43:06.792
You seemed like a deserving guy.

43:19.305 --> 43:20.139
Jang-do.

43:20.639 --> 43:21.473
Oui ?

43:22.891 --> 43:25.978
Take Beom
and find me a file on him.

43:26.478 --> 43:27.646
Serious.

43:29.690 --> 43:30.524
Understood.

43:31.025 --> 43:33.944
ANTIQUE STORE

43:41.452 --> 43:43.621
- Thanks for coming.
- My pleasure.

43:46.874 --> 43:47.958
What are you doing ?

43:48.459 --> 43:49.460
Quoi ?

43:49.543 --> 43:51.795
- You want to come ?
- Yes.

43:51.879 --> 43:54.965
I'll try
to convince Mr. Choi to hire me.

43:55.049 --> 43:57.760
- That would be cool, right?
- It would be great.

43:57.843 --> 43:59.970
So support me.

44:00.054 --> 44:01.472
Throw me some flowers.

44:01.555 --> 44:03.307
- All right.
- Okay, let's go.

44:25.704 --> 44:27.373
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

44:30.084 --> 44:32.503
- Did you find it without any problem?
- Yes.

44:32.586 --> 44:35.923
I just paid off my loans
with your money.

44:36.006 --> 44:38.842
Thank you so much.

44:40.928 --> 44:42.805
You'll do well.

44:42.888 --> 44:44.765
I'll do my best.

44:44.848 --> 44:48.185
Hello Sir !
My name is Hong Woo-jin.

44:48.268 --> 44:50.896
I used to work for Mr. Moon
.

44:51.397 --> 44:54.858
I'm Gun-woo's brother in arms
since the marines.

44:54.942 --> 44:56.026
Oui.

44:56.110 --> 44:58.904
I followed Gun-woo's misadventures from afar .

44:58.987 --> 45:02.408
I wanted to help him,
but there was nothing I could do.

45:02.491 --> 45:04.993
And it was eating away at me.

45:05.077 --> 45:08.497
I'm relieved
that someone good helped him.

45:08.580 --> 45:10.124
Thank you.

45:10.207 --> 45:12.167
And I came to the conclusion

45:12.251 --> 45:14.294
that I could be useful to you.

45:14.378 --> 45:16.296
I know the job better.

45:17.631 --> 45:19.967
It embarrasses me to brag in front of you,

45:20.050 --> 45:23.178
the living legend of Myeong-dong,

45:23.762 --> 45:25.889
but I know it better than him.

45:25.973 --> 45:29.601
"What if I accompanied Gun-woo
to teach him the trade

45:30.269 --> 45:31.353
"and assist him?

45:32.020 --> 45:34.356
“That would be useful to him, wouldn’t it?

45:34.440 --> 45:36.650
“It would even be very beneficial.”

45:36.734 --> 45:39.278
It is this reasoning that brings me here.

45:39.862 --> 45:43.323
With your permission,
I will accompany him to help him!

45:50.873 --> 45:51.790
Why not ?

45:55.544 --> 45:56.462
Merci !

45:57.838 --> 45:58.797
Sit down.

45:58.881 --> 45:59.798
All right.

46:02.342 --> 46:04.511
- THANKS !
- Thanks for the tea!

46:05.012 --> 46:07.431
I forgot to mention one detail.

46:08.557 --> 46:11.727
I pay you,
but I'm not the one who hires you.

46:12.436 --> 46:13.270
Pardon ?

46:13.353 --> 46:15.564
You have an interview with Hyeon-ju.

46:17.816 --> 46:18.942
I see.

46:19.026 --> 46:20.319
More...

46:20.402 --> 46:23.030
What if I don't pass the interview?

46:23.113 --> 46:25.073
You will have to return the salary.

46:26.992 --> 46:30.245
But I used it
to repay the loan.

46:30.329 --> 46:32.080
I'm sure it will be fine.

46:32.748 --> 46:33.582
Quoi ?

46:34.666 --> 46:39.463
I'm warning you,
Hyeon-ju doesn't want a bodyguard.

46:39.546 --> 46:42.633
But I'm not convincing, Mr. Choi.

46:42.716 --> 46:43.926
Good luck.

46:44.009 --> 46:45.219
M. Choi.

46:45.302 --> 46:50.599
If I can persuade Hyeon-ju
to hire Gun-woo and me,

46:50.682 --> 46:52.351
I will have a salary too?

46:55.354 --> 46:56.647
That works.

46:56.730 --> 46:57.648
Woo-jin.

46:59.274 --> 47:01.485
I have a head massage waiting for me.

47:01.568 --> 47:02.945
- All right.
- Bye.

47:03.028 --> 47:04.571
Bon massage.

47:04.655 --> 47:05.656
Hold...

47:07.616 --> 47:08.784
Take this

47:09.535 --> 47:11.328
and treat yourself to a good meal.

47:13.121 --> 47:15.332
All right. Thank you sir.

47:16.792 --> 47:19.253
This is truly my dream job.

47:19.336 --> 47:20.170
Sir.

47:22.506 --> 47:23.841
Both...

47:26.510 --> 47:28.428
stick together no matter what.

47:30.681 --> 47:31.598
All right !

47:32.099 --> 47:33.016
Good luck !

47:33.100 --> 47:34.142
Merci !

47:46.154 --> 47:47.322
Damn then!

47:54.872 --> 47:56.415
Holy shit!

47:57.124 --> 47:58.125
- What ?
- Come !

47:58.208 --> 47:59.334
Quoi ?

47:59.918 --> 48:02.296
- It was in there.
- Serious ?

48:02.796 --> 48:05.132
There must be 100 million won.

48:05.215 --> 48:06.717
- That much ?
- Hold on.

48:12.431 --> 48:13.307
Did you see that ?

48:14.933 --> 48:16.518
Whore ! In there too.

48:18.186 --> 48:19.104
Attends...

48:38.415 --> 48:41.668
THERE ARE GUESTS AT THE BOOKSTORE
CHAT WELL WITH THEM

48:42.461 --> 48:43.545
Piss off.

48:45.422 --> 48:50.010
Seventeen billion,
18 billion, 19 billion...

48:51.845 --> 48:53.931
- 21 billion...
- Woo-jin.

48:54.014 --> 48:55.140
In truth,

48:56.350 --> 48:58.477
I already met Hyeon-ju.

48:59.269 --> 49:01.480
What ? How so ?

49:02.147 --> 49:04.316
On my way to your house the other day,

49:05.067 --> 49:07.694
she was chasing a guy dressed as a homeless person.

49:07.778 --> 49:11.031
I followed her,
and she tasered me.

49:11.114 --> 49:13.283
- A taser shot?
- Yes.

49:13.367 --> 49:15.577
Did you fight against her?

49:15.661 --> 49:19.164
No, she just insulted me, that's all.

49:19.247 --> 49:20.749
I see.

49:22.876 --> 49:23.877
Do not worry.

49:24.670 --> 49:26.296
I'll take care of everything.

49:26.380 --> 49:28.507
Do not say anything.

49:28.590 --> 49:30.801
Be discreet.

49:31.885 --> 49:34.554
- You made me lose count.
- Sorry.

49:44.815 --> 49:46.149
Hello, Hyeon-ju.

49:46.233 --> 49:49.486
We were chosen by Mr. Choi himself

49:49.569 --> 49:52.072
to guarantee your safety at work.

49:52.656 --> 49:56.743
Hashtag, bodyguard.
Hashtag, close protection.

49:56.827 --> 49:58.078
Hashtag, manager.

49:58.161 --> 50:02.374
Hashtag, we're here for you.

50:02.916 --> 50:04.501
Can you repeat ?

50:04.584 --> 50:07.713
We're here for you. Delighted.

50:10.799 --> 50:12.843
At your service.

50:12.926 --> 50:15.470
We'll do whatever you need.

50:15.554 --> 50:17.014
I do not need anything.

50:19.558 --> 50:24.062
Okay, but in the future,
let us know if you need anything.

50:24.146 --> 50:27.107
I won't need
anything in the future either, just go.

50:33.155 --> 50:34.573
Don't you like us?

50:35.198 --> 50:38.577
That's not the question.
I don't need you.

50:38.660 --> 50:42.414
You can't know
until you see us at work.

50:42.497 --> 50:44.875
I do very well on my own,

50:44.958 --> 50:47.127
I really don't need you.

50:47.627 --> 50:49.421
So stop insisting.

50:49.504 --> 50:50.756
I do not insist...

50:50.839 --> 50:53.133
You see, you start again.

50:53.216 --> 50:54.593
go away

51:01.099 --> 51:04.186
Mr. Choi said we could stay.

51:05.103 --> 51:06.772
Even against my will?

51:09.107 --> 51:12.277
Whore ! And a liar to boot!

51:12.778 --> 51:14.905
You're faker than your sneakers.

51:15.489 --> 51:16.531
Cleared.

51:17.991 --> 51:19.284
Get out, I said!

51:20.869 --> 51:23.413
Are you deaf or what?

51:23.497 --> 51:25.791
Get the fuck out!

51:45.102 --> 51:47.562
I really need this job.

51:47.646 --> 51:48.939
Just for a month.

51:49.022 --> 51:51.441
If I don't make myself useful, I'll leave.

51:51.525 --> 51:53.777
Just one month, please.

51:54.277 --> 51:55.237
Stopped.

51:55.320 --> 51:58.824
If you need money,
my grandfather will give you a loan.

51:58.907 --> 52:01.368
I'll talk to him about it. Come on, go away.

52:01.451 --> 52:02.869
That's embarrassing now.

52:02.953 --> 52:03.870
Money...

52:05.747 --> 52:09.459
Mr. Choi has already given me
two years' advance on my salary.

52:10.669 --> 52:13.922
My mother accepted
a fraudulent loan from Smile Capital.

52:14.714 --> 52:16.716
She has a debt of 100 million,

52:17.217 --> 52:20.470
and I had to pay her back this morning
with this money.

52:20.554 --> 52:25.016
If I have to give it back to him,
I'll be in big trouble.

52:25.517 --> 52:28.854
Please, I beg you.

52:31.481 --> 52:32.774
Standing.

52:33.358 --> 52:34.276
Let's go eat.

52:44.035 --> 52:46.663
Why did you borrow money from them?

52:47.581 --> 52:49.332
My mother was fooled.

52:50.625 --> 52:52.294
How much did she borrow?

52:53.420 --> 52:54.671
Cent millions.

52:55.463 --> 52:59.092
Was the money enough to calm them down?
Was there any other damage?

52:59.759 --> 53:02.387
My mother runs a café,

53:02.470 --> 53:04.764
but they ransacked it.

53:05.515 --> 53:06.391
I see.

53:07.934 --> 53:10.645
Is that where you got your facial injury?

53:12.105 --> 53:12.981
Oui.

53:15.609 --> 53:17.319
You have to blame them.

53:18.361 --> 53:19.779
Did you file a complaint?

53:20.822 --> 53:21.656
Non.

53:24.409 --> 53:26.494
They threatened to kill my mother.

53:27.787 --> 53:28.622
Who ?

53:30.248 --> 53:31.458
Their boss.

53:31.541 --> 53:35.086
Hot in front, the hamburgers are served!

53:37.631 --> 53:39.341
Listen to me before you eat.

53:45.347 --> 53:46.598
As you know,

53:46.681 --> 53:48.850
my grandfather is no longer a loan shark.

53:48.934 --> 53:51.353
He makes zero interest loans.

53:51.937 --> 53:53.230
But sometimes,

53:53.313 --> 53:56.733
bastards abuse his generosity.

53:56.816 --> 53:58.735
Including a man named Yang Jae-myeong.

53:59.569 --> 54:02.113
He said his mother had to have surgery.

54:02.197 --> 54:04.115
He disappeared with ten million.

54:04.199 --> 54:06.493
It took me six months to find him.

54:07.285 --> 54:09.621
I saw him begging in front of the metro.

54:10.413 --> 54:14.167
At first
I thought he was really on the street,

54:14.251 --> 54:18.546
but as I passed him,
I saw that his teeth were clean.

54:19.506 --> 54:21.007
So, I followed him.

54:21.633 --> 54:25.679
He and his henchmen
pretend to be homeless

54:25.762 --> 54:28.431
to steal the papers of real homeless people.

54:29.182 --> 54:32.769
They open bank accounts
in the name of shell companies,

54:32.852 --> 54:34.688
scam small loan sharks

54:34.771 --> 54:38.108
and borrow hundreds of millions.

54:39.317 --> 54:41.528
Their tactics were too ingenious

54:41.611 --> 54:44.406
so that Yang Jae-myeong thought about it.

54:45.657 --> 54:49.327
I found out
he was close to this man.

54:50.620 --> 54:51.454
You know him ?

54:56.126 --> 54:57.252
Oui.

55:02.632 --> 55:08.054
Our goal is to count
how many papers they steal in one night.

55:08.138 --> 55:10.348
Above all, don't stand out.

55:10.432 --> 55:12.017
If they spot you,

55:12.100 --> 55:14.144
all my plans are falling through.

55:17.814 --> 55:19.691
ID CARD

56:30.929 --> 56:32.889
Take a cap, hide your features.

56:59.249 --> 57:00.875
Hey, this one?

57:01.376 --> 57:02.627
He's dead drunk.

57:02.710 --> 57:04.712
Maybe he has some stuff on him.

57:10.760 --> 57:12.303
Over there.

57:12.387 --> 57:15.098
- Find me one who is sober.
- All right.

57:17.058 --> 57:18.309
- Follow me.
- Yes.

57:18.393 --> 57:20.353
- Let's go.
- Yes.

57:41.249 --> 57:42.250
Head down.

57:51.092 --> 57:52.719
Good day sir.

57:52.802 --> 57:53.720
Oui.

57:54.220 --> 57:58.433
You should not sleep on the floor
on thin newspapers.

57:58.516 --> 58:00.852
Get something thicker.

58:00.935 --> 58:02.020
It's true.

58:02.645 --> 58:03.521
Bon sang.

58:03.605 --> 58:07.400
- When was your last meal?
- Yesterday or the day before yesterday.

58:07.484 --> 58:09.652
Do not be afraid.

58:09.736 --> 58:13.156
We represent a homeless association
financed by the city.

58:13.239 --> 58:14.449
I see.

58:14.532 --> 58:18.453
The municipality created this association
so that we can help each other.

58:18.536 --> 58:20.038
Do you want to join?

58:20.121 --> 58:21.080
Quoi ?

58:21.164 --> 58:24.250
You won't have to sleep here anymore.

58:24.334 --> 58:26.419
We'll find you a job.

58:26.503 --> 58:29.756
You will have 20 free masks per month.

58:29.839 --> 58:33.885
And a monthly allowance
of 300,000 won.

58:33.968 --> 58:34.886
300 000 won...

58:37.180 --> 58:38.014
Sir.

58:38.097 --> 58:41.559
Do you have papers?
We can already register you.

58:41.643 --> 58:44.604
And we'll bring you the money
next week.

58:44.687 --> 58:45.730
You understand ?

58:45.813 --> 58:47.065
- Yes.
- GOOD.

58:49.234 --> 58:50.151
Hold.

58:51.486 --> 58:53.738
Not a word, places are limited.

58:53.821 --> 58:54.697
All right.

58:55.573 --> 58:56.407
Merci.

58:56.491 --> 58:58.451
What a bullshitter.

58:58.535 --> 58:59.369
Merci.

59:02.455 --> 59:03.873
<i>They already have four...</i>

59:15.885 --> 59:17.845
- Sorry sir.
- What ?

59:18.846 --> 59:21.057
We are from a homeless association.

59:21.140 --> 59:24.102
- And so...
- You bastard!

59:24.602 --> 59:27.397
Bastard! Give me back my ID card!

59:27.480 --> 59:31.192
What ? Are you crazy or what? Whore !

59:32.360 --> 59:33.736
Let me go, asshole!

59:37.407 --> 59:39.701
No ! We can't intervene!

01:01:39.153 --> 01:01:42.115
