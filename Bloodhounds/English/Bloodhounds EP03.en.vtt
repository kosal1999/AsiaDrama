00:21.813 --> 00:22.981
What is this

00:25.275 --> 00:26.943
Who are you

00:35.869 --> 00:38.496
Come closer, bastard.

00:38.997 --> 00:39.998
You scoundrel!

00:43.460 --> 00:44.461
Damn

00:45.628 --> 00:46.463
Let's go

00:52.761 --> 00:54.471
"Woo Jin." Let's call an ambulance.

00:54.554 --> 00:57.015
The situation could get worse, Gun-woo.

00:57.098 --> 00:58.808
The man is dying.

01:15.867 --> 01:16.826
“Hyun Joo.”

01:16.910 --> 01:18.995
An elderly homeless man was seriously injured,

01:19.079 --> 01:21.164
So we called an ambulance.

01:21.247 --> 01:22.624
What about Jae Myung Yang?

01:23.541 --> 01:24.459
he escaped

01:24.542 --> 01:26.503
the curse! I ordered you not to interfere!

01:26.586 --> 01:28.379
But he was seriously injured.

01:28.463 --> 01:29.756
We had no other choice.

01:29.839 --> 01:32.008
You don't even know him, so why did you intervene?

01:32.092 --> 01:34.010
Yes, but...

01:39.307 --> 01:40.141
What do we do?

01:45.438 --> 01:46.397
I will call her.

01:53.404 --> 01:56.282
- What?
- Hyun Joo, about what happened...

01:56.783 --> 01:58.201
We are very sorry.

01:58.284 --> 02:00.161
We are completely wrong.

02:00.245 --> 02:03.039
Where are you? I want to apologize personally.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.375
Forget it, cancel the deal.

02:05.458 --> 02:08.545
Hyun Joo,
just give us five minutes of your time, please?

02:08.628 --> 02:11.047
I am completely serious.

02:11.131 --> 02:14.008
I truly apologize for what happened.
Gun-woo wants to apologize too.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.761
Give us five minutes, please.

02:17.345 --> 02:18.179
Please

02:18.680 --> 02:20.348
Come to the book store.

02:32.235 --> 02:33.444
"Woo Jin."

02:35.488 --> 02:37.323
I honestly can't understand it.

02:37.407 --> 02:38.616
What don't you understand?

02:39.200 --> 02:42.745
If we had not acted, that elderly homeless man would have died.

02:42.829 --> 02:43.746
You saw what happened yourself.

02:44.330 --> 02:45.165
correct

02:45.248 --> 02:48.293
We did the right thing,
so what made you apologize in this way?

02:48.376 --> 02:52.213
- Why should we apologize?
- This was our first interaction at work.

02:52.714 --> 02:55.341
Hyun Joo didn't witness what happened
so it's hard for her to understand.

02:56.551 --> 02:59.137
Our knowledge of each other is still superficial
and this has happened.

02:59.220 --> 03:02.307
If we apologize for actions
that may result in misunderstandings

03:02.807 --> 03:04.642
We will be able to come to an understanding with her.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.605
- But...
- “Gun-woo.”

03:09.189 --> 03:11.733
I don't find you at fault for what you did.

03:11.816 --> 03:13.484
But to preserve the job,

03:14.360 --> 03:17.655
We can alleviate this situation
if we help each other.

03:18.406 --> 03:20.325
Just this once, okay?

03:22.368 --> 03:24.162
Ok, Deal

03:48.937 --> 03:52.315
"Catch outside the ring"

04:00.323 --> 04:02.700
Don't sit down. The meeting will end quickly.

04:03.534 --> 04:05.161
Did you fight Jae Myung Yang?

04:05.787 --> 04:07.872
It was inevitable to fight him.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.624
We can't work together.

04:12.168 --> 04:13.169
What is the matter

04:13.253 --> 04:14.796
Don't you find it a logical decision?

04:15.380 --> 04:16.881
We sincerely apologize to you.

04:16.965 --> 04:19.217
I don't want any apology.

04:20.385 --> 04:23.179
Jae Myung Yang saw your faces, didn't he?

04:24.097 --> 04:27.350
My plan was to secretly track him down and collect evidence.

04:27.433 --> 04:30.561
Now that Jae Myung Yang knows
that someone is tracking him, he will hide.

04:30.645 --> 04:33.398
So my plan was ruined.

04:33.481 --> 04:35.858
We were wearing a hat and mask. He wouldn't have seen our faces.

04:35.942 --> 04:39.487
correct. As long as you cover your face, he won't recognize you.

04:39.570 --> 04:42.156
As long as your ugly hair was covered,
he wouldn't recognize you.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.617
the curse! I would have recognized you
from a few meters away!

04:45.743 --> 04:47.870
Why are you waiting? Get out.

04:47.954 --> 04:50.081
- We apologized.
- I said get out!

04:50.164 --> 04:51.708
- We had no other choice.
- How?

04:51.791 --> 04:53.251
We are working together for the first time.

04:53.334 --> 04:55.169
-We're not perfect!
-That's why I rejected you!

04:55.253 --> 04:56.296
We act according to the situation!

04:56.379 --> 04:57.797
- What situation?
- I already told you!

04:57.880 --> 04:59.090
you do not understand

04:59.173 --> 05:00.842
Why did I include my hair in the topic?

05:00.925 --> 05:02.093
- We're leaving.
- Damn it.

05:02.176 --> 05:03.845
Stop shouting please.

05:05.096 --> 05:06.931
I will find a way

05:08.391 --> 05:10.727
I return the money
Mr. Choi gave me.

05:12.770 --> 05:17.358
Since we listened to your shouting

05:18.443 --> 05:19.986
I hope you listen to me too.

05:26.367 --> 05:29.203
If someone offers you to perform a job smoothly

05:30.621 --> 05:32.332
In exchange for killing someone,

05:33.416 --> 05:34.500
Can you perform it?

05:47.680 --> 05:49.682
The president of Smile Capital slit my face with a knife.

05:51.809 --> 05:54.479
If I refrain from taking a stand
while someone is dying in front of me,

05:55.188 --> 05:57.523
I would have been worse than that man.

05:59.317 --> 06:00.735
That would have been a crime.

06:03.404 --> 06:04.697
think about it

06:40.149 --> 06:43.111
I will find a place. Don't worry about that.

06:44.487 --> 06:46.739
I'm sorry. I couldn't stop myself from speaking.

06:47.532 --> 06:49.492
But you resisted yourself more than me.

06:50.868 --> 06:53.704
Are you hungry?
Let's go to a restaurant I know that serves soup.

06:55.581 --> 06:56.749
Wait.

06:58.209 --> 07:00.628
It's probably closed due to Covid.
We're past 10.

07:03.005 --> 07:05.216
This makes me hungrier.

07:05.800 --> 07:06.926
I forgot

07:10.221 --> 07:11.305
My stomach hurts

07:12.890 --> 07:15.226
It's not my fault the restaurant closed due to Covid.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.479
It's your fault for mentioning it.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.316
You just couldn't stop yourself
from talking to Hyun Joo.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.235
You even praised me.

07:24.318 --> 07:26.654
I praised you because you were wailing like a loser.

07:26.737 --> 07:28.448
I wasn't sobbing.

07:29.907 --> 07:32.785
"I wasn't sobbing."

07:33.619 --> 07:34.912
What are you doing?

07:34.996 --> 07:37.999
I imitate you, loser. "Wow, I'm hungry."

07:38.082 --> 07:40.084
- My stomach hurts.
- Wow.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.086
How ugly you are.

07:44.338 --> 07:45.882
Why did you cross the line with such a joke?

07:45.965 --> 07:48.509
What? I wasn't kidding. I'm serious

07:49.594 --> 07:52.555
Your words hurt me deeply, so I apologize.

07:58.352 --> 08:01.272
"I'm sorry, I was wrong.
I'll see you both tomorrow at the office at ten in the morning."

08:02.231 --> 08:03.065
"Woo Jin."

08:04.984 --> 08:08.362
I knew we would convince her!

08:51.322 --> 08:54.492
You will not arrive!

08:54.575 --> 08:55.409
You will not arrive!

08:55.493 --> 08:57.453
Your voice is loud!

08:58.538 --> 09:00.373
Do not get angry. It's just a game.

09:00.456 --> 09:01.707
- The club is expensive.
- Why the anger?

09:01.791 --> 09:03.918
- Hurry up and start.
- Oh God, I will.

09:04.418 --> 09:06.045
- It's my turn.
- I know, you bastard.

09:06.128 --> 09:07.588
- Don't curse.
- It doesn't matter.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.799
-You have to wear your mask, sir.
-Understood.

09:14.053 --> 09:15.096
What is the matter

09:16.097 --> 09:18.057
Someone is following us, sir.

09:19.725 --> 09:20.601
from

09:21.352 --> 09:23.896
They were young, but they were good at fighting.

09:24.897 --> 09:25.731
are you sure

09:26.315 --> 09:28.818
- What?
- Are you sure someone is following you?

09:30.611 --> 09:31.487
to focus

09:31.571 --> 09:32.572
It's all about it...

09:33.781 --> 09:34.615
to speak

09:34.699 --> 09:36.659
Before I start working with you,

09:36.742 --> 09:38.828
I borrowed money from somewhere.

09:38.911 --> 09:41.289
The bastards didn't mention
they wanted him back, so I ignored them.

09:41.372 --> 09:44.292
- Get to the point.
- But they came to me recently to get a refund.

09:44.375 --> 09:47.545
The scoundrel who came to collect the money
was wearing a hat with a red cat on it.

09:47.628 --> 09:50.840
The bastard who raided us today
was wearing the same hat.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.011
Wasn't it a coincidence?

09:56.762 --> 09:58.472
No, it was the same hat, sir.

10:02.810 --> 10:04.228
Where did you borrow money from?

10:04.312 --> 10:06.814
I will explain yesterday's position briefly,

10:06.897 --> 10:09.275
Jae Myung Yang had robbed
that homeless man before,

10:09.358 --> 10:11.736
But he forgot that.

10:11.819 --> 10:14.363
So a quarrel ensued as soon as he spoke.

10:16.157 --> 10:18.034
But how much do Jae Myung's men borrow?

10:18.117 --> 10:20.870
With one stolen ID?

10:21.912 --> 10:23.706
Approximately 50 million per broker account.

10:24.373 --> 10:26.167
That is 500 million from ten stolen cards.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.419
Woe to him. How long have they been doing this?

10:29.754 --> 10:31.756
I think for at least half a year.

10:31.839 --> 10:35.051
Wow! They must have amassed a lot of wealth.

10:36.135 --> 10:39.180
Didn't the moneylenders take a stand?

10:39.263 --> 10:41.724
The police will investigate them if they report what happened.

10:41.807 --> 10:45.019
They try to recover the money themselves
but are unable to do so.

10:47.188 --> 10:48.522
This is my plan.

10:48.606 --> 10:51.359
Find the
moneylenders who were defrauded by Jae Myung Yang,

10:51.442 --> 10:54.070
And recover the money that Jae Myung Yang stole
in exchange for a commission.

10:55.446 --> 10:58.157
One percent of the commission
is worth three billion won.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.534
It should be two percent.

11:06.374 --> 11:07.208
"Woo Jin."

11:08.459 --> 11:10.336
If the moneylenders were defrauded,

11:10.419 --> 11:13.631
Wouldn't that make the situation more difficult for the people
who borrowed from them?

11:14.215 --> 11:15.341
What

11:15.424 --> 11:18.427
They will have to harass their customers more
to make up for their losses.

11:19.011 --> 11:19.887
And what?

11:20.429 --> 11:24.392
I see that small businesses are the most affected party.

11:25.559 --> 11:26.977
you are right

11:27.061 --> 11:27.895
Okay

11:40.741 --> 11:42.076
How did they find us?

11:42.910 --> 11:44.370
How did they find us?

11:44.453 --> 11:45.287
I don't know

11:48.541 --> 11:50.668
Turn off the lights and sign outside.

11:51.335 --> 11:52.461
Damn

11:55.506 --> 11:57.758
"Byeonghwa Books"

11:59.135 --> 12:00.803
- Turn off your phones.
- Okay.

12:08.185 --> 12:09.437
Is this the place? Are you sure?

12:09.520 --> 12:10.438
Sure sir.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.698
Borrowed money from a bookstore?

12:21.323 --> 12:24.994
Yes. Its owner was an important moneylender at the time.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.929
Listen, kick that.

12:54.064 --> 12:54.940
Kick here.

12:57.276 --> 12:58.944
Hurry, you bastard!

13:06.118 --> 13:07.870
-Kick harder.
-What?

13:07.953 --> 13:09.580
Kick harder, you bastard!

13:09.663 --> 13:10.706
the curse

13:12.458 --> 13:13.292
more powerful

13:14.376 --> 13:15.211
more powerful

13:15.711 --> 13:17.296
Kick harder, you bastard!

13:21.759 --> 13:22.593
its enough

13:23.928 --> 13:26.180
We'll need heavy equipment to break it.

13:29.016 --> 13:30.351
Here is the safe.

14:10.140 --> 14:13.894
When you were back yesterday,
did you check if anyone was following you?

14:15.062 --> 14:17.314
We took a bus.

14:17.898 --> 14:19.984
They could have tracked the bus.

14:20.901 --> 14:24.947
If they tracked us down last night,
why didn't they surprise us directly?

14:25.030 --> 14:26.615
Why do they move now?

14:27.199 --> 14:30.077
- Maybe he wanted Joon Min Kim to come...
- Hyun Joo.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.371
Jae Myung Yang noticed
our fighting style yesterday.

14:32.454 --> 14:35.124
If he wanted to raid us,
he would have brought more men.

14:36.083 --> 14:38.919
Maybe they weren't sure either.

14:39.003 --> 14:42.506
But they've probably been confirmed now.

14:46.760 --> 14:50.472
Anyway,
it's important to know how we found them.

14:50.556 --> 14:53.017
This way
we will avoid making the same mistake twice.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.643
Okay, I totally understand that.

14:54.727 --> 14:58.230
Why don't we sit down to discuss it? Do you agree?

15:05.738 --> 15:08.365
Does Jae Myung Yang know this place?

15:09.074 --> 15:10.492
He came here a long time ago.

15:11.911 --> 15:16.081
This means that he obtained information
that made him realize our connection to the place here.

15:16.582 --> 15:17.958
correct

15:20.544 --> 15:21.545
Okay

15:25.883 --> 15:26.759
In reality

15:27.927 --> 15:30.137
He probably recognized your hat.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.766
The matter and what is in it,

15:33.849 --> 15:37.603
I tracked you down a while ago
while you were chasing a homeless man.

15:37.686 --> 15:38.771
right...

15:40.105 --> 15:42.524
Yes, it was me.

15:43.025 --> 15:45.778
That homeless man was Jae Myung Yang.

15:46.362 --> 15:47.863
Good. the curse

15:47.947 --> 15:51.408
I was wearing a hat then, wasn't I?

15:51.992 --> 15:54.745
Okay. It was a special hat.

15:56.288 --> 15:58.499
Maybe they found out about us this way.

15:58.582 --> 16:01.961
But why do you think they kicked in the shutters?

16:02.544 --> 16:05.923
Our shutters are made to order
from steel, not aluminum.

16:06.006 --> 16:07.341
They were checking this out.

16:07.424 --> 16:09.843
Damn, I think they'll be back.

16:12.221 --> 16:13.263
I did not come

16:30.489 --> 16:31.949
What were you doing?

16:33.117 --> 16:35.327
That white car came here,
didn't it?

16:37.037 --> 16:38.205
Speak up.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.752
I'm sorry sir. It's my fault

16:44.586 --> 16:47.798
We went out to work last night.

16:47.881 --> 16:49.049
Work of what kind?

16:49.133 --> 16:51.176
that it

16:53.721 --> 16:55.055
Work of what kind?

16:56.557 --> 16:58.100
We were tracking Jae Myung Yang.

16:59.226 --> 17:00.477
- Why?
- Serious.

17:00.561 --> 17:02.855
The loan sharks want to catch Jae Myung Yang.

17:02.938 --> 17:05.816
I'm sure they would be willing
to pay a fee to make it happen.

17:05.899 --> 17:08.235
And I'm the only one who can catch him.

17:09.236 --> 17:10.487
Is the goal money?

17:10.571 --> 17:12.322
Making money benefits us.

17:14.074 --> 17:15.576
And what did you do?

17:16.452 --> 17:19.121
They're my bodyguards, right?

17:20.748 --> 17:22.041
I was not harmed.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.293
I'm disappointed in you.

17:26.253 --> 17:28.255
I'm disappointed in you too, Grandpa.

17:28.338 --> 17:30.466
It's clear that Jae Myung Yang
is up to no good.

17:30.549 --> 17:31.925
Why not take a stand?

17:32.009 --> 17:35.471
Mr. Huang can get rid of him easily.

17:35.554 --> 17:38.640
Are you frustrated? I'm more disappointed than you!

17:39.850 --> 17:42.603
Gun-woo, remove the bandage.

17:42.686 --> 17:44.438
- What?
- Remove it quickly.

17:45.355 --> 17:47.024
What? Good

17:50.235 --> 17:53.489
If Jae Myung Yang
and Jun Min Kim continue to defraud moneylenders

17:53.572 --> 17:56.200
They will inevitably become a source of threat and gain control

17:56.283 --> 17:58.702
On helpless people like Gun Woo.

17:58.786 --> 18:03.123
Your charitable deeds will become worthless.

18:03.207 --> 18:06.085
Your money will go straight into their pockets.

18:06.752 --> 18:09.338
If you really want to help those in need,

18:09.421 --> 18:12.549
You must first get rid of corrupt people
like Jae Myung Yang.

18:14.384 --> 18:16.095
Who did this to your face?

18:17.387 --> 18:20.557
Chairman of Smile Capital, sir.

18:22.101 --> 18:22.935
What is his name

18:23.018 --> 18:26.188
I do not know his name

18:27.648 --> 18:29.733
He had a long scar on his left cheek.

18:39.076 --> 18:39.993
Go back to your house.

18:57.719 --> 18:58.554
my lord

18:59.763 --> 19:01.598
Could it be just a coincidence?

19:02.099 --> 19:05.936
Please check if Myung-Gil Kim
is the CEO of Smile Capital.

19:06.019 --> 19:06.854
Yes sir.

19:14.194 --> 19:16.238
Joe Joe

19:17.489 --> 19:18.365
What

19:18.448 --> 19:20.617
You described us as your bodyguards.

19:20.701 --> 19:23.287
I have to admit, it made me happy.

19:23.370 --> 19:24.371
Accordingly

19:24.454 --> 19:27.916
I thought it would be nice
if we could talk without titles.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.002
We're a team, JoJo.

19:30.085 --> 19:32.629
So we won't be a team if we save the titles?

19:32.713 --> 19:37.134
It's a suggestion, it would be nice
if we worked as one big family.

19:37.217 --> 19:40.971
If we are a family,
the eldest among us should invite us to eat.

19:41.054 --> 19:42.097
Will you buy?

19:42.723 --> 19:45.017
I prefer to save titles, ma'am.

19:45.726 --> 19:46.768
I'm kidding

19:46.852 --> 19:49.104
Let's use the Jedi card. what do you want to

19:49.188 --> 19:50.022
Rib meat.

19:50.731 --> 19:51.565
Then you pay.

19:53.442 --> 19:54.276
Grill restaurant.

19:54.359 --> 19:57.446
- Grill restaurant?
- Yes. I know an excellent restaurant.

20:01.074 --> 20:02.576
Good

20:02.659 --> 20:03.493
Let's go

20:06.747 --> 20:08.999
How long have you been friends with Gun Woo?

20:09.791 --> 20:13.253
I think the length of time has no importance
in knowing people.

20:13.337 --> 20:16.089
Knowing a person for a long time
does not necessarily mean that he is a true friend.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.007
Meaning?

20:17.090 --> 20:18.800
What really matters

20:18.884 --> 20:21.762
It is the similarity of their path in life.

20:21.845 --> 20:25.849
Their ability to understand each other,
even if the dialogue was short.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.392
This is what is important.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.645
- Does this apply to you?
- Yes.

20:29.728 --> 20:34.399
Likewise, boxers like us
do not just exchange punches.

20:34.983 --> 20:36.985
"That's how you lived your life then."

20:37.069 --> 20:37.903
a hit

20:37.986 --> 20:39.529
"This is how I lived."

20:39.613 --> 20:42.783
Every stroke expresses

20:42.866 --> 20:47.913
About the personality of the fighter
, the nature of his heart, his experiences and his history...

20:49.248 --> 20:50.123
Do you mean its history?

20:50.749 --> 20:51.917
Its history.

20:53.210 --> 20:55.879
Everything becomes clear to us and we know it.

20:56.755 --> 20:57.589
naturally

20:58.173 --> 20:59.549
Also, Gun Woo

21:01.343 --> 21:03.053
A marine older than me.

21:04.221 --> 21:06.014
This makes everything you need to know clear.

21:06.682 --> 21:08.225
What exactly becomes clear?

21:09.893 --> 21:11.144
Everything you need to know.

21:11.228 --> 21:12.437
What do you need to know?

21:12.521 --> 21:15.565
JoJo, there's no way to explain this.

21:15.649 --> 21:17.317
It is a matter for the Navy.

21:17.401 --> 21:23.657
This is like rappers resorting to describing everything they consider
to be rap as an umbrella term.

21:23.740 --> 21:25.284
It's indescribable.

21:25.367 --> 21:27.911
Understood. You say indescribable?

21:28.704 --> 21:30.998
-Are you mocking me?
-Absolutely not.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.416
It's really...

21:32.499 --> 21:33.625
- Here.
- Okay.

21:37.838 --> 21:38.672
What

21:39.923 --> 21:41.925
Haven't you fired up the grill yet?

21:42.009 --> 21:43.176
You didn't ask me to do this.

21:43.260 --> 21:45.971
It is known that whoever sits
at the table lights the grill.

21:46.054 --> 21:48.348
I did not know. Why didn't you light it before you went?

21:48.432 --> 21:51.518
How could I do this?
The grill would have burned out by the time I got back.

21:51.601 --> 21:53.312
How does iron burn?

21:53.395 --> 21:55.105
Not iron.

21:55.188 --> 21:58.942
What I'm saying is that the meat will burn
if the grill is too hot.

21:59.026 --> 22:00.152
So the meat won't burn.

22:00.235 --> 22:02.446
This is what is understood by the phrase "burning the grill."

22:02.529 --> 22:05.949
That's what grilling professionals use to describe it,
and I'm just an ordinary person.

22:06.033 --> 22:09.286
- My mom uses the phrase "burn the grill" too.
- And my mom doesn't use it.

22:10.287 --> 22:12.205
- Who knows the nature of meat...
- She lit it.

22:12.706 --> 22:13.707
Start grilling.

22:13.790 --> 22:15.167
Well, I can't.

22:15.250 --> 22:17.544
Meat cannot be placed on a lukewarm grill.

22:17.627 --> 22:19.838
True, it will spoil its taste. We must wait.

22:22.799 --> 22:25.177
Let's talk while the grill heats up.

22:26.136 --> 22:29.514
“Gun-woo.” Speak spontaneously.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.391
Good. Are you related to Mr. Choi?

22:31.975 --> 22:34.603
What? I did not expect you to ask this.

22:34.686 --> 22:37.898
I was curious about that too.

22:39.816 --> 22:40.650
In reality

22:42.152 --> 22:43.487
Briefly

22:45.989 --> 22:49.117
I found out at eight years old
that I had cancer of the spine.

22:49.701 --> 22:52.037
By the time I was ten years old, I was cured of it.

22:53.622 --> 22:56.500
But my father was dead.

22:58.085 --> 23:00.128
So I was sent to an orphanage,

23:01.254 --> 23:03.173
But because I hated him so much, I ran away from him.

23:04.299 --> 23:06.093
Usually I was starving,

23:07.052 --> 23:10.722
I eat the leftover black vermicelli
that people leave on their doorsteps.

23:11.348 --> 23:13.725
I also worked in bars
with other runaway children.

23:14.893 --> 23:16.186
But it was a hard life.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.148
So I returned to the orphanage.

23:22.275 --> 23:25.570
I was transferred to a different orphanage when I turned 17.

23:26.446 --> 23:28.365
My grandfather was the owner of the orphanage.

23:28.448 --> 23:30.325
- Mr. Choi?
- Yes.

23:30.826 --> 23:33.829
He founded an orphanage out of a desire to do good.

23:36.123 --> 23:38.166
He was very friendly in dealing with me.

23:38.875 --> 23:41.378
At first I thought he was a perverted man.

23:42.838 --> 23:44.256
But over time I realized...

23:46.425 --> 23:48.093
He's acting like himself.

23:48.176 --> 23:52.264
My grandfather allowed me to learn everything that I could not learn
due to lack of money.

23:52.347 --> 23:56.101
I learned to practice kendo
and ride motorcycles.

24:01.982 --> 24:04.776
I find Mr. Choi a wonderful person.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.778
Since middle school days

24:06.862 --> 24:09.906
I work part time jobs
with my mother to pay off my father's debts.

24:10.574 --> 24:14.411
When our debt reached 100 million won,
I felt completely helpless.

24:15.370 --> 24:18.206
I realize how terrifying 100 million won is.

24:18.707 --> 24:21.877
So when Mr. Choi gave me money
and asked me to pay off my debts,

24:21.960 --> 24:23.211
I addressed myself

24:24.171 --> 24:26.923
It is necessary to protect this man at all costs.

24:29.050 --> 24:32.762
My grandfather told me that it is important to evaluate one's character

24:32.846 --> 24:34.431
It takes an open mind.

24:34.514 --> 24:38.143
Those who have a deep personality
will recognize your sincerity and deal with you in a friendly manner.

24:38.935 --> 24:41.354
As for superficial personalities, they will exploit this against you.

24:42.606 --> 24:44.733
- That's right.
- You're a friendly person, Gun-woo.

24:45.233 --> 24:49.154
correct. He is distinguished by his friendliness and perseverance.

24:49.779 --> 24:52.240
-I think we can start grilling now.
-Sure.

25:01.082 --> 25:03.168
It's perfect timing.

25:03.251 --> 25:04.127
I find you learning.

25:04.211 --> 25:06.338
I learned from the creator.

25:06.963 --> 25:09.424
I suddenly felt left out.

25:10.967 --> 25:12.719
It's not your fault. Hurry up and turn it over.

25:12.802 --> 25:13.720
I cannot

25:13.803 --> 25:15.180
Trust him. He's good at this.

25:15.847 --> 25:17.933
Woe to him. I can't get used to this style of dialogue.

25:18.016 --> 25:19.142
Well, take your time.

25:21.853 --> 25:22.812
It smells delicious.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.442
- Let's eat whatever food is available.
- Yes.

25:28.026 --> 25:30.195
-When will the stitches be removed?
-Tomorrow.

25:30.278 --> 25:31.279
Does it hurt?

25:31.363 --> 25:32.572
Unbearable pain.

25:33.865 --> 25:37.118
- I asked for my drink to be hot.
- It is preferable to drink it cold in the winter.

25:37.202 --> 25:38.912
How amazing you are.

25:39.538 --> 25:40.705
- Hyun Joo.
- Yes.

25:40.789 --> 25:44.251
Shouldn't we do something
now that Jae Myung Yang knows where we are?

25:45.961 --> 25:47.963
I'll talk to my grandfather about it.

25:49.339 --> 25:51.716
- Hurry to ask him, as we are running out of time.
- Okay.

25:53.635 --> 25:54.511
Mrs. Lee.

25:55.095 --> 25:57.055
The hotel lobby is the first place to make an impression.

25:57.556 --> 26:02.352
I want our foreign guests to see
the best, most beautiful and luxurious Korean-designed lobby.

26:02.435 --> 26:05.397
Of a kind they have never seen before.

26:05.480 --> 26:06.690
Well, understood.

26:06.773 --> 26:08.316
"Team Leader Soo Hyun Lee"

26:08.400 --> 26:10.569
I look forward to hearing your genius ideas

26:10.652 --> 26:12.070
At tomorrow's meeting.

26:12.153 --> 26:15.782
The club will be located on the top floor of that hotel.

26:15.865 --> 26:19.119
My goal is to have an annual revenue
of 100 billion won.

26:19.202 --> 26:20.829
There are a lot of people

26:20.912 --> 26:24.207
They are impatient to be unable to gamble due to Covid.

26:24.791 --> 26:29.254
We will reserve a suite for them each week
so they can enjoy their time.

26:30.338 --> 26:32.674
We will secretly film them gambling.

26:32.757 --> 26:35.468
As soon as we have enough money,

26:36.136 --> 26:41.850
Jang Do will hand over evidence
proving illegal gambling to the police.

26:43.602 --> 26:46.104
When the hotel deteriorates and loses its value

26:47.063 --> 26:50.191
We'll go in and take over the entire hotel.

26:58.992 --> 27:01.161
When Jang Do returns
with what Director Hong owes,

27:01.244 --> 27:03.246
We must be prepared to pay a hundred billion.

27:03.330 --> 27:06.082
We're currently about 50 billion short, right?

27:06.166 --> 27:07.000
Yes sir

27:08.043 --> 27:10.545
It's time to get all our money.

27:11.880 --> 27:14.382
Sell ​​everything of value.

27:15.467 --> 27:16.885
I'm coming

27:24.309 --> 27:25.268
Yes sir.

27:25.352 --> 27:27.854
The car I just mentioned has arrived.

27:27.937 --> 27:29.105
Good

27:30.440 --> 27:31.858
I will be back soon, sir.

27:43.745 --> 27:44.996
what's going on

27:51.336 --> 27:52.170
"sink outlet"

27:53.380 --> 27:54.214
Is there anyone?

27:56.216 --> 27:58.093
what is happening? the curse

28:00.845 --> 28:02.305
Consider this man.

28:13.441 --> 28:15.527
- Don't lift your feet.
- Damn it!

28:22.325 --> 28:24.452
How disgusting. Screw it.

28:26.287 --> 28:27.497
What is this scoundrel doing?

28:28.331 --> 28:29.332
Pardon me.

28:29.416 --> 28:30.250
Pull it!

28:30.333 --> 28:32.711
You're doomed, you bastard.

28:33.503 --> 28:35.046
where are you going

28:35.547 --> 28:37.257
unclothe

28:38.675 --> 28:41.094
Come here

28:46.558 --> 28:48.518
Hello sir. from here

28:48.601 --> 28:50.311
-Is he inside now?
-Yes.

28:50.395 --> 28:51.730
Thank you for your hard work.

28:54.107 --> 28:56.109
-You can count him.
-Thank you, sir.

28:56.192 --> 28:58.361
- You bastard.
- Damn it.

28:58.445 --> 29:01.781
I'm sorry. Give me something to wear.

29:03.783 --> 29:05.702
I see you insulted him, men.

29:05.785 --> 29:06.995
Hello sir

29:07.078 --> 29:09.998
so cold. Can someone give me something to wear?

29:10.707 --> 29:11.624
I'm sorry sir.

29:16.504 --> 29:17.422
Welcome

29:21.301 --> 29:22.218
You

29:23.720 --> 29:25.430
It's you, isn't it? the curse

29:25.930 --> 29:27.390
the bastard

29:28.558 --> 29:31.227
You started pretending that you were important.

29:32.228 --> 29:33.396
Foolish

29:34.105 --> 29:34.939
For your information,

29:35.690 --> 29:38.610
You shouldn't have been messing with him.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.529
I thought he might be afraid

29:41.613 --> 29:43.865
He apologizes to you or something

29:43.948 --> 29:46.618
Because your relative is a policeman?

29:54.918 --> 29:57.629
Let me teach you an important lesson.

29:58.838 --> 30:02.842
Untamed animals bite if they are hit.

30:04.552 --> 30:08.515
It doesn't matter whether you are stronger or weaker than her.

30:08.598 --> 30:10.308
They just bite.

30:18.983 --> 30:20.276
And now.

30:23.363 --> 30:24.197
remove your clothes

30:24.280 --> 30:25.448
What

30:25.532 --> 30:27.742
take off your Pants

30:27.826 --> 30:29.452
Okay, now I understand.

30:29.536 --> 30:31.496
Release me this time.

30:31.579 --> 30:33.915
- Shit.
- I'm sorry.

30:33.998 --> 30:35.416
I don't know why this happened...

30:35.500 --> 30:36.543
"In a day."

30:37.502 --> 30:39.295
Release me this time.

30:43.299 --> 30:44.509
Let's end this matter.

30:55.520 --> 30:56.688
Do you want to get naked or not?

30:58.731 --> 31:00.108
do not kill me

31:00.900 --> 31:02.735
- Please let me live.
- Drink more.

31:07.282 --> 31:08.741
Do you want to get naked or not?

31:18.251 --> 31:20.128
I'll get naked!

31:20.712 --> 31:21.629
Immediately

31:26.843 --> 31:28.303
good decision

31:28.887 --> 31:31.556
Let's see you get naked, Director Hong.

31:49.157 --> 31:50.491
"I had a scandal"

31:50.575 --> 31:52.660
Okay, that's enough.

32:02.086 --> 32:05.006
"Kick boxing"

32:08.134 --> 32:09.427
Work on getting it upright. Let's go

32:28.988 --> 32:29.989
Okay

32:30.073 --> 32:35.995
Mr. Choi, the Myung Gil Kim we know
is actually the president of Smile Capital.

32:36.663 --> 32:37.956
Good

32:39.123 --> 32:41.542
I will come to pick you up. I will arrive with you shortly, sir.

32:42.043 --> 32:42.877
Good

33:04.565 --> 33:06.734
I apologize for this sudden decision.

33:09.487 --> 33:12.448
I've been going through personal difficulties recently.

33:14.367 --> 33:18.204
The decision was made after much thought,
so I hope you understand.

33:19.539 --> 33:21.791
Our company will close at the end of this month.

33:23.543 --> 33:25.044
I will transfer it to you

33:25.795 --> 33:28.339
General salary and end-of-service bonus.

33:32.427 --> 33:33.886
Thank you for everything you have done.

33:34.512 --> 33:35.680
my lord

33:37.390 --> 33:39.600
What about our money that people currently owe?

33:40.393 --> 33:41.769
I'll take care of him.

34:09.172 --> 34:11.049
my dad

34:31.319 --> 34:33.821
- Yes.
- This is In Mok Oh from security, sir.

34:34.405 --> 34:36.449
I think your office was broken into by thieves.

34:37.325 --> 34:38.326
How many are there?

34:44.040 --> 34:45.166
I think they are two.

35:10.858 --> 35:11.692
Hey you

35:13.236 --> 35:14.362
I said ten minutes would be enough.

35:15.446 --> 35:18.449
This model usually has six numbers.

35:18.533 --> 35:19.492
As for this one, it is eight.

35:19.575 --> 35:20.952
I think it's modified.

35:22.328 --> 35:24.580
- What should I do?
- I need more time.

35:25.331 --> 35:26.332
faster

35:51.065 --> 35:51.899
I opened it!

35:52.984 --> 35:54.735
Good. Stay away

36:03.494 --> 36:04.871
"Model Agreement for a Private Loan"

36:04.954 --> 36:08.040
These bills are worth one billion won.

36:27.268 --> 36:28.102
What happened

36:28.186 --> 36:30.605
No one came out. I stopped the elevator.

36:30.688 --> 36:31.856
Good

36:32.523 --> 36:35.234
Well, shall I accompany you?

36:35.318 --> 36:37.987
No need for that. Thanks

36:38.821 --> 36:41.073
Wait. Lend me this.

36:41.157 --> 36:41.991
Help yourself

37:17.860 --> 37:18.945
Who are you

37:22.990 --> 37:24.116
How did you get here?

38:19.630 --> 38:20.673
Who sent you?

38:27.930 --> 38:29.181
Who sent you?

38:29.265 --> 38:30.099
Damn

38:30.933 --> 38:32.393
Who sent you?

38:35.896 --> 38:36.981
Who sent you?

38:38.149 --> 38:39.317
Who sent you?

39:00.671 --> 39:01.839
the curse

40:34.265 --> 40:35.474
Sir, are you okay?

40:35.558 --> 40:36.684
Kill that bastard!

41:25.691 --> 41:27.067
It's okay, Beom.

41:27.151 --> 41:29.153
- Well, Beom.
- Okay.

41:29.236 --> 41:30.488
- Clear?
- Okay, sir.

41:30.571 --> 41:31.906
“In Beom Kang!”

41:34.033 --> 41:35.159
We're running out of time.

41:35.242 --> 41:38.204
Take all the money in the safe and go downstairs first.

41:43.042 --> 41:45.294
calm yourself

42:17.243 --> 42:18.202
my lord

42:19.453 --> 42:20.788
He disappeared.

42:26.043 --> 42:27.461
- Get ahead of me.
- Yes, sir.

42:49.233 --> 42:50.901
- Mr. Choi.
- Yes?

43:20.514 --> 43:22.600
Have you thought about it?

43:26.478 --> 43:28.314
For your sake. what's the problem

43:29.523 --> 43:31.191
Let's avoid Jae Myung Yang.

43:32.234 --> 43:33.152
Why

43:33.652 --> 43:35.613
They kill people.

43:35.696 --> 43:37.573
Let's move the bookstore too.

43:38.157 --> 43:39.199
Why

43:39.283 --> 43:40.451
“Hyun Joo.”

43:43.621 --> 43:44.788
A current reflection.

43:48.584 --> 43:50.544
I am old and tired.

43:51.128 --> 43:53.339
I no longer have strength or courage,

43:54.256 --> 43:55.674
To fight them.

43:56.175 --> 43:58.802
I want to live the rest of my days in peace,

43:59.470 --> 44:04.642
I will teach you what I want,

44:06.352 --> 44:09.188
And I leave to you what I want to leave to you.

44:10.898 --> 44:13.108
This is my only wish.

44:17.946 --> 44:19.448
Can you achieve this?

44:25.537 --> 44:26.622
good

44:27.998 --> 44:29.041
I thank you

45:52.416 --> 45:54.251
The value of gold is bound to rise

45:54.793 --> 45:57.463
When people lose confidence in paper currency.

45:57.546 --> 46:01.175
That's why it's safer to have
a secret stash of gold.

46:01.967 --> 46:04.344
If gold is melted and mixed with other gold,

46:04.428 --> 46:06.597
It actually washes off.

46:07.973 --> 46:10.309
This is the first thing I learned from Choi.

46:14.396 --> 46:16.899
My failure to reach his hidden gold...

46:19.526 --> 46:20.778
It still makes me feel remorseful.

46:21.403 --> 46:23.489
That old bastard.

46:24.323 --> 46:26.992
Why shut down the damn company?

47:20.045 --> 47:21.088
"By day."

47:21.171 --> 47:22.130
Yes sir

47:22.965 --> 47:24.007
Enter

47:35.519 --> 47:36.812
What is your opinion

47:37.646 --> 47:38.605
it is amazing

47:43.694 --> 47:45.279
Gold bars worth 500 million.

47:45.362 --> 47:47.531
If our trade in Korea deteriorates,

47:48.740 --> 47:51.702
You and I will take him and go to Vietnam.

47:52.911 --> 47:56.999
Someone planted it in the Vietnamese government.

47:57.958 --> 47:58.792
And with this gold,

48:00.419 --> 48:03.422
We will be able to live like kings
for the rest of our lives.

48:05.757 --> 48:06.717
Thank you sir.

48:11.597 --> 48:13.473
You are my brother

48:14.057 --> 48:16.143
I would do anything for you.

48:17.436 --> 48:18.270
"By day."

48:20.814 --> 48:23.901
I have no one left but you.

48:25.485 --> 48:26.486
You know that, right?

48:33.619 --> 48:34.786
Come on.

48:36.455 --> 48:38.707
They have the best fried pork in the world.

48:38.790 --> 48:40.417
- Is it that delicious?
- Yes.

48:50.177 --> 48:51.929
Oh aunt?

48:53.305 --> 48:55.766
Oh aunt.

48:56.808 --> 48:58.226
This is me, Woo Jin.

48:58.310 --> 49:01.271
Oh, Woo Jin!

49:02.064 --> 49:03.106
What happened

49:04.316 --> 49:06.735
I borrowed a private loan.

49:07.778 --> 49:09.321
They asked me to pay it back.

49:09.404 --> 49:12.741
I told them that I had no money to make my project falter.

49:13.533 --> 49:14.952
They destroyed everything.

49:15.035 --> 49:16.995
Oh, I'm afraid.

49:19.247 --> 49:20.540
What do I do

49:26.338 --> 49:29.007
She can't run her restaurant because you broke it.

49:29.091 --> 49:31.468
How do you expect her to pay you interest now?

49:31.551 --> 49:33.053
You weren't paying.

49:33.136 --> 49:35.764
I ask you to be kind to her.
Everyone faces difficult times.

49:35.847 --> 49:38.058
How can I earn my living then?

49:38.141 --> 49:40.102
Why don't you pay the money back?

49:40.811 --> 49:43.563
You know I don't have the money to do that.

49:43.647 --> 49:45.190
Close your mouth then.

49:45.273 --> 49:48.485
Mind your business, okay?

49:49.027 --> 49:49.945
Good

49:59.329 --> 50:00.205
It is m

50:01.623 --> 50:03.208
He's who I used to work with.

50:03.291 --> 50:06.086
He was recently defrauded by someone who loaned him 500 million won.

50:06.169 --> 50:08.005
- Is it Jae Myung Yang?
- I don't know.

50:08.088 --> 50:10.215
I don't know. I didn't ask for details.

50:10.298 --> 50:13.510
But a homeless card and an intermediary account were used.

50:13.593 --> 50:14.511
It's the same style.

50:15.095 --> 50:16.054
it is him

50:17.556 --> 50:18.974
We must catch him.

50:20.517 --> 50:22.519
I am a victim too and I must act.

50:23.395 --> 50:25.063
My grandfather asked us to stay out of sight.

50:25.814 --> 50:27.190
They are dangerous people.

50:27.274 --> 50:29.526
I think it is wrong not to act.

50:30.152 --> 50:31.528
Why don't I call him?

50:31.611 --> 50:33.613
And tell him about Yang so he can catch him?

50:34.781 --> 50:36.992
If the goal is to catch him,
we have to do it.

50:37.492 --> 50:38.577
We might make money.

50:38.660 --> 50:42.289
If we make money from this,
can I help Auntie with it?

50:42.372 --> 50:45.375
We'll share it and you can use it however you want.

50:46.626 --> 50:49.254
- Okay.
- I want to help her too.

50:53.091 --> 50:54.009
Come closer.

50:57.763 --> 50:58.638
Come closer.

50:58.722 --> 50:59.639
Screw it.

51:02.642 --> 51:03.560
Thanks

51:18.033 --> 51:19.034
I bet everything I have.

51:32.005 --> 51:34.424
You should take a look at this, sir.

51:37.094 --> 51:38.386
That car.

51:39.513 --> 51:42.015
They turned off the engine but no one came out.

51:44.810 --> 51:46.269
- Get ready.
- Yes, sir.

51:47.437 --> 51:48.855
Check your phone!

51:48.939 --> 51:49.773
Yes sir.

51:56.822 --> 51:58.448
They arrived, sir.

51:59.658 --> 52:02.035
Do exactly what I ask in two hours.

52:26.101 --> 52:27.102
They have arrived.

52:35.777 --> 52:36.903
Let's go

52:42.534 --> 52:44.578
You will die today, you bastards.

53:49.851 --> 53:50.977
Yes sir.

53:52.187 --> 53:53.313
You can come down now.

54:03.448 --> 54:04.532
Get out!

54:05.492 --> 54:08.536
I know you're here,
so hurry up and show yourself, you bastards.

54:09.037 --> 54:12.540
Get out, you bastards! Are you playing hide and seek?

54:12.624 --> 54:13.500
Ughdan

54:27.764 --> 54:30.225
please answer

54:30.308 --> 54:32.185
"(Hyun Joo)"

54:37.274 --> 54:38.858
- Yes?
- Serious.

54:38.942 --> 54:40.026
The two young men are in danger.

54:41.027 --> 54:42.195
Where are you

54:42.279 --> 54:43.154
Hurry up!

54:43.238 --> 54:44.489
- Come on!
- Let's go!

54:45.073 --> 54:45.991
You scoundrels!

54:46.074 --> 54:47.284
Let's go

54:49.202 --> 54:50.328
Damn

54:50.829 --> 54:52.038
Let's go

54:53.581 --> 54:57.377
Damn. unbelievable

56:52.784 --> 56:55.745
