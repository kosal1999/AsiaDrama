00:16.057 --> 00:16.933
Run!

00:21.438 --> 00:22.313
Run. quickly

00:45.920 --> 00:46.755
Hey!

00:50.467 --> 00:52.010
the curse

00:52.594 --> 00:53.428
Throw the bag!

00:54.304 --> 00:55.513
Damn

00:56.765 --> 00:57.891
You scoundrel!

00:59.684 --> 01:01.436
actuate

01:02.937 --> 01:04.647
"Hyun Joo!" Hurry! Run faster!

01:04.731 --> 01:05.565
Run faster!

01:08.443 --> 01:10.195
Hurry! Run faster!

01:11.780 --> 01:13.198
actuate

01:15.075 --> 01:17.202
- Those bastards.
- Run faster!

01:17.285 --> 01:18.286
Hurry!

01:20.288 --> 01:21.498
Get on board quickly!

01:21.581 --> 01:24.793
Close the door, Woo-jin. The Door

01:35.637 --> 01:37.263
Damn

02:00.745 --> 02:04.249
"Catch outside the ring"

02:05.083 --> 02:09.254
Who borrowed more from Myung Gil Kim than we expected.

02:09.337 --> 02:13.091
People entered the bar at hour-long intervals.

02:13.174 --> 02:15.844
Some of them came in official police cars.

02:16.928 --> 02:18.388
I don't know the name

02:18.888 --> 02:21.474
But there was a tennis player
I saw on TV.

02:23.268 --> 02:27.105
Yes, I'm sure he's expanded his influence
over the years.

02:45.832 --> 02:48.960
I knew Myung Gil was a former prisoner.

02:49.669 --> 02:53.756
He said he wanted
to start over working for me.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.885
He begged me desperately.

02:59.762 --> 03:00.930
This occurred to me.

03:03.266 --> 03:05.310
After Myung-gil got me,

03:06.060 --> 03:08.521
She hid in Namhae with Mr. Oh.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.900
Then I heard rumours

03:12.859 --> 03:15.445
It says that Myung Gil
has established a company with my money and bonds.

03:17.113 --> 03:19.782
I was the one who had to take care of him.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.785
I was the one who taught him.

03:27.832 --> 03:29.626
But I didn't even dare to think

03:31.002 --> 03:33.171
In pursuit of him.

03:35.757 --> 03:39.344
I stopped you from chasing Myung-gil back then.

03:40.428 --> 03:41.554
And I apologize for that.

03:42.847 --> 03:45.767
I was afraid I would lose you too.

03:52.857 --> 03:54.317
You always cared about me

03:55.735 --> 03:58.696
And you protected me as if I were part of your family, sir.

04:00.531 --> 04:01.616
I am always prepared

04:02.951 --> 04:06.120
To sacrifice my life for you, sir.

04:07.372 --> 04:08.414
I thank you

04:10.625 --> 04:11.542
and I am sorry

04:20.843 --> 04:21.678
Okay

04:23.513 --> 04:24.347
truly

04:26.641 --> 04:27.892
Concept. Come quickly.

04:31.729 --> 04:35.358
It seems, sir, that Myung Gil Kim's men
have taken the youth by surprise

04:35.942 --> 04:38.111
While they were transferring money from the bookstore.

04:38.194 --> 04:40.571
- Were they harmed?
- No, nothing was mentioned about that.

04:41.072 --> 04:42.073
but

04:43.658 --> 04:45.576
They lost all the money in the safe.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.287
Were they harmed or not?

04:48.162 --> 04:49.622
I think they are fine.

04:52.792 --> 04:55.920
They also tied up one of them in the building,

04:56.004 --> 04:58.506
But they were unable to deal with it, so what should we do?

05:00.466 --> 05:03.970
When the emergency department receives a patient
who was injured while carrying out an illegal activity,

05:04.887 --> 05:07.223
Doctors are required to report to the police.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.268
So I made a deal with a hospital

05:10.768 --> 05:12.687
To prepare for any surgery at any time.

05:13.813 --> 05:16.399
Myung-gil must have a hospital of his own.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.652
I'll assign Do-young to do this as his bike will help him.

06:11.662 --> 06:12.622
Well done.

06:14.123 --> 06:14.999
Wait.

06:18.753 --> 06:19.837
Well done

06:20.546 --> 06:21.631
Good. Thanks

06:22.715 --> 06:26.219
Get some sleep first,
then come to my restaurant.

06:27.428 --> 06:29.389
For any reason in particular...

06:30.390 --> 06:31.766
To eat.

06:32.642 --> 06:33.476
Good

06:35.436 --> 06:36.437
Wouldn't you like that?

06:37.855 --> 06:39.399
I don't usually eat lunch.

06:39.482 --> 06:40.942
- Right.
- Okay.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.319
Enter

06:51.452 --> 06:52.286
Welcome

06:57.792 --> 06:58.793
Are you well

07:01.045 --> 07:03.840
We lost all the money in the safe. I'm sorry

07:03.923 --> 07:05.800
Have you been harmed?

07:08.636 --> 07:09.846
I'm fine

07:10.596 --> 07:11.806
It's okay then.

07:13.224 --> 07:17.270
Good. Let me finish moving the boxes.
You should go to sleep first.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.568
Are you sure you're not hurt?

07:28.030 --> 07:28.865
Yes

08:23.294 --> 08:25.880
The problem isn't that I didn't pay them back.
That guy...

08:27.548 --> 08:29.592
"One day" is generally fine,

08:30.176 --> 08:31.969
But his right eardrum was perforated.

08:33.221 --> 08:36.599
I'll check the license plate number
that the car camera captured in the morning.

08:36.682 --> 08:37.975
Haven't done this yet?

08:39.101 --> 08:41.604
The police have not started their work yet.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.608
I don't like the tone of your voice.

08:48.069 --> 08:49.111
I like your look.

08:49.779 --> 08:50.905
the curse

08:58.120 --> 09:01.457
If they have used an unregistered car
or a fake license plate,

09:01.541 --> 09:04.794
Can you track the distance you have traveled
using surveillance cameras?

09:06.295 --> 09:08.798
This is possible but will take time.

09:09.465 --> 09:12.260
Plates can be easily searched
on the police internal network.

09:12.843 --> 09:16.180
But you must go to the control center
and check the cameras one by one.

09:16.764 --> 09:18.808
Each province has its own control center,

09:18.891 --> 09:20.977
So I need time to assign the right people.

09:21.769 --> 09:24.939
Money is no problem, so do it as soon as possible.

09:25.773 --> 09:26.607
Yes sir.

09:26.691 --> 09:29.443
Find out who owns the building
where the bookstore is located.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.655
If it's President Choi,
you'll be able to find his home address.

09:33.531 --> 09:34.365
Yes sir.

09:34.448 --> 09:37.618
Let me talk to Jang Do alone.

09:39.203 --> 09:40.037
Sorry

09:42.373 --> 09:43.457
Didn't you hear me?

09:47.336 --> 09:48.421
Yes sir.

10:09.483 --> 10:12.737
Why did they leave "Byom" there in your opinion?

10:14.530 --> 10:16.282
Perhaps they were busy transferring money.

10:16.991 --> 10:19.452
Come on, Jang Do.

10:20.077 --> 10:23.039
People who think positively do not improve their skills.

10:23.664 --> 10:25.458
Think negative for a change.

10:26.125 --> 10:29.128
Allow your fear of those bastards

10:29.211 --> 10:32.048
Who did everything in their power to kill you

10:32.131 --> 10:33.549
To own your thoughts.

10:36.385 --> 10:37.678
Let's track him down?

10:40.723 --> 10:44.769
He assigned more men to guard the hospital,
dressed them in patient uniforms, and armed them.

10:45.603 --> 10:46.437
Your order, sir.

10:48.272 --> 10:49.857
He assigned men to track down Jun Min as well.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.028
Did he do something wrong?

10:54.111 --> 10:57.281
Oh God. I asked you to think negatively.

10:58.449 --> 11:01.577
President Choi
may have accessed his personal data.

11:02.620 --> 11:03.663
Understood

11:05.790 --> 11:09.502
Jun Min is a coward. He couldn't hide his facial expressions.

11:10.169 --> 11:12.296
They can spot it from a distance.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.340
It's better to keep it in secret, okay?

11:15.257 --> 11:16.092
Your order, sir.

11:17.927 --> 11:22.098
I don't think they would assign Yang Jung Hwang
to deal with someone as petty as him.

11:22.598 --> 11:23.891
They'll send Do Young Lee.

11:23.974 --> 11:27.186
I previously told you about his ability to move
in wide areas with his bicycle.

11:27.269 --> 11:28.104
correct

11:28.187 --> 11:31.065
Block its entrances and exits and catch it.

11:33.234 --> 11:34.068
Your order, sir.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.071
This will be fun.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.766
Good morning, Mr. Choi.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.059
Did you sleep

12:07.143 --> 12:08.644
Yes, I slept.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.105
I came back very late. You should rest.

12:11.188 --> 12:12.857
I had enough deep sleep.

12:12.940 --> 12:13.983
Good. “Gun-woo.”

12:14.525 --> 12:16.277
There's something I want to talk to you about.

12:16.360 --> 12:17.194
Concept

12:22.324 --> 12:25.161
Hyun Joo is a lonely young woman.

12:25.244 --> 12:27.705
There was always darkness in her heart.

12:27.788 --> 12:28.622
Good

12:29.582 --> 12:33.085
That's why you act cold sometimes on purpose.

12:33.753 --> 12:34.879
Good

12:36.297 --> 12:39.884
But Hyun Joo became noticeably cheerful
after meeting you and Woo Jin.

12:39.967 --> 12:42.803
For that I am very grateful to you both.

12:43.721 --> 12:45.556
We're also happy to be with Hyun Joo.

12:45.639 --> 12:49.143
As for the money I paid you in advance,

12:50.144 --> 12:51.020
Consider it lost.

12:52.104 --> 12:53.647
Good

12:53.731 --> 12:55.775
Where was he lost?

12:55.858 --> 12:58.068
What I'm trying to say is that our scores are settled.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.612
Good. What's the reason

12:59.695 --> 13:03.741
Do you know how much money I got back from the bookstore yesterday?

13:04.408 --> 13:05.743
In reality

13:10.623 --> 13:14.668
I am offering you a reward for a sound financial transfer.

13:14.752 --> 13:15.586
Concept

13:16.837 --> 13:19.548
I would like to pay what I owe by working for him.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.383
You've earned it.

13:22.551 --> 13:24.845
You have recovered a large amount.

13:27.681 --> 13:31.352
Also, you no longer owe me.

13:31.936 --> 13:36.440
Take your mother and open a new café in a wonderful place,
like Jeju Island, for example.

13:37.983 --> 13:40.152
I will take care of the necessary investments.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.866
Thank you very much, Mr. Choi.

13:46.367 --> 13:49.954
But I'd like your help in catching
Myung-Gil Kim,

13:50.746 --> 13:52.081
Till the end

13:52.164 --> 13:53.707
You helped me enough.

13:53.791 --> 13:56.418
Absolutely.
I would like to help until this whole thing is over.

13:57.920 --> 13:58.754
And what's the reason

13:59.713 --> 14:00.965
I want to return the favor.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.008
I did enough.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.718
I don't find it enough.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.097
It won't be over until it's completely over.

14:11.517 --> 14:12.393
Good

14:14.270 --> 14:16.355
It won't be over until it's completely over.

14:17.606 --> 14:19.859
Let's drink wine together soon.

14:20.568 --> 14:22.945
Actually, I don't drink alcohol.

14:23.654 --> 14:24.530
Wow.

14:24.613 --> 14:26.532
But I can pour you some wine.

14:31.078 --> 14:33.289
- Go upstairs.
- Yes, sir.

14:43.591 --> 14:45.885
"Sushi"

14:58.606 --> 15:00.983
Add a little wasabi
and serve with soy sauce.

15:22.004 --> 15:23.005
It is wild.

15:24.423 --> 15:25.841
Farmed halibut

15:25.925 --> 15:28.886
Its fins are full of fat
and it may be very heavy.

15:28.969 --> 15:32.139
But the wild one, like this fish, is soft

15:32.222 --> 15:33.933
The fat is evenly distributed.

15:34.558 --> 15:37.645
The distinctive, pure taste of halibut is delicious...

15:39.688 --> 15:41.231
I can taste it every time I chew it.

15:41.815 --> 15:43.150
It was also manufactured with distinction.

15:45.444 --> 15:47.821
Do you like sashimi?

15:47.905 --> 15:51.575
In fact, I worked for a short period of time
providing content for a sashimi restaurant in the past.

15:51.659 --> 15:54.328
But I left it
because I couldn't get a thousand subscribers.

15:54.411 --> 15:57.706
Wow. This is my first time
eating such a long slice.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.209
It curls around my mouth like a whip.

16:00.876 --> 16:03.671
It's the best halibut I've ever had, sir.

16:04.713 --> 16:05.547
Like

16:06.840 --> 16:08.258
Wow, Woo Jin. you are a mazing

16:08.342 --> 16:10.636
I toiled through life.

16:10.719 --> 16:11.929
I will subscribe.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.722
- I said I left him.
- That's right.

16:14.431 --> 16:18.060
You guys had a rough time yesterday
, so I wanted to invite you over for dinner.

16:18.143 --> 16:19.603
Thank you sir.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.271
How will you handle it starting now?

16:21.855 --> 16:23.357
We'll kill the big man,

16:24.316 --> 16:27.027
We catch someone who looks like a wild cat
and force him to talk.

16:27.611 --> 16:31.198
That bastard wildcat lookalike
is the one covering up for Myung-gil.

16:31.281 --> 16:35.077
If I had to guess, he is the one who buys people's silence.

16:35.160 --> 16:38.664
He threatens them into submission
when Myung Gil Kim causes trouble.

16:38.747 --> 16:43.043
After we get him and find the body he buried
on Myung Gil Kim's orders, this will be over.

16:43.127 --> 16:45.170
No amount of money can make a dead body disappear.

16:45.254 --> 16:47.256
I think this will destroy Smile Capital.

16:47.339 --> 16:48.340
This is correct

16:49.299 --> 16:51.635
What will we look for if we don't find the body?

16:51.719 --> 16:54.138
If we find the murder weapon
or the required footage,

16:54.221 --> 16:55.764
They will end up too.

16:57.766 --> 16:58.600
Please.

17:00.227 --> 17:01.937
As for the yellow-tailed,

17:02.771 --> 17:04.231
If you age it...

17:04.314 --> 17:05.941
I'm sorry

17:06.775 --> 17:08.569
- Sit down.
- You took as much time as you needed.

17:09.111 --> 17:11.488
Hello, I'm Do Young Lee.
I heard about you both.

17:11.572 --> 17:13.490
- I'm Gun Woo Kim, sir.
- Okay.

17:13.574 --> 17:14.950
- I'm Woo Jin Hong.
- Oh God.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.494
Boxers' fists have a different structure.
Nice to meet you.

17:17.578 --> 17:20.748
I actually went to the underground passage
the other day.

17:20.831 --> 17:24.710
I went there right after the boss called me
but I live far away so I was late.

17:24.793 --> 17:27.379
But I saw those idiots lying on the ground

17:27.463 --> 17:30.090
It occurred to me that you are “strong fighters.”

17:30.174 --> 17:31.050
Good

17:32.051 --> 17:35.679
You also dreamed
of being world champion in the past, didn't you?

17:35.763 --> 17:37.848
Why did you involve me in this matter?

17:37.931 --> 17:38.766
why not

17:40.350 --> 17:41.935
Can you carry out an assassination today?

17:42.895 --> 17:43.937
What

17:44.021 --> 17:45.355
sales manager

17:45.439 --> 17:47.066
We will talk alone.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.526
Why? They will accompany us.

17:50.027 --> 17:51.820
What do you mean

17:56.533 --> 17:58.702
They are the ones who wanted to participate, so don't take your anger out on me.

18:01.830 --> 18:03.665
Listen, if you two have a criminal record,

18:03.749 --> 18:06.168
You won't be able to get back in the ring.
You know that, right?

18:06.794 --> 18:08.003
Yes

18:10.756 --> 18:13.008
Why do you want to confront Myung Gil Kim?

18:13.092 --> 18:15.344
I must avenge the death of my men.

18:15.427 --> 18:18.347
You may die while fighting Myung-Gil Kim.

18:18.430 --> 18:19.264
Aren't you afraid?

18:19.848 --> 18:21.350
I don't fear death.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.060
It scares me not to kill them.

18:25.437 --> 18:26.730
What will you do?

18:26.814 --> 18:28.690
- I will accompany them.
- Me too.

18:28.774 --> 18:29.817
Why

18:30.442 --> 18:32.569
Myung-Gil Kim is a horrible person.

18:33.570 --> 18:36.865
My family would have been destroyed if it weren't for Mr. Choi's intervention.

18:37.491 --> 18:39.618
I'm only good at fighting,

18:40.244 --> 18:42.079
But I want to help until the end.

18:42.955 --> 18:43.872
Me too

18:43.956 --> 18:46.458
I think that we, the marine duo,
can be of help.

18:46.542 --> 18:47.918
Did you serve in the Navy?

18:48.001 --> 18:48.836
Yes sir

18:49.378 --> 18:50.963
Are you from the Navy, sir?

18:51.046 --> 18:52.923
I was relieved of duty, but he's in the Navy.

18:53.924 --> 18:54.758
Wait.

18:55.509 --> 18:56.760
my regards

18:59.263 --> 19:00.264
my regards

19:01.265 --> 19:04.560
Why do you keep revealing my personal information?
Are you crazy?

19:04.643 --> 19:07.187
This way we get to know each other.

19:09.731 --> 19:11.316
Hands down, you idiots!

19:11.400 --> 19:13.110
Tell us your band sir!

19:13.610 --> 19:14.778
I said keep your hands down.

19:16.029 --> 19:18.198
I'd like to call you Senior Marine, sir!

19:18.907 --> 19:22.119
Consider this scoundrel. He's forcing me to get up.
I said, 'Put your hand down, you idiot.'

19:24.037 --> 19:26.331
Whoever was a marine remains one, sir!

19:26.415 --> 19:29.209
- See this?
- Take it easy.

19:29.293 --> 19:32.171
This fool is trying to gain the upper hand over me.
Watch what he does.

19:32.671 --> 19:35.090
No, sir,
the spirit of the Navy prevails over you.

19:35.174 --> 19:38.177
He's extreme in his boasting about the Navy, sir.

19:38.260 --> 19:39.970
Please forgive him.

19:40.554 --> 19:41.471
"Hard-headed in his boasting"?

19:42.055 --> 19:43.974
That is, he feels very proud to be one of the forces.

19:44.057 --> 19:45.184
Which forces?

19:45.267 --> 19:47.811
- Marines.
- Okay.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.396
Tell me your band please sir.

19:49.938 --> 19:51.565
He's proud to be a Marine.

19:51.648 --> 19:53.025
Tell me please sir.

19:55.444 --> 19:58.238
I'm from Troop 571. Are you happy now?

20:00.282 --> 20:01.575
You're a senior Marine.

20:01.658 --> 20:03.118
my regards

20:09.458 --> 20:10.584
Will you accompany us too?

20:11.585 --> 20:13.337
Do you think I'm incapable of fighting?

20:14.838 --> 20:18.217
This might worry the president. That's why I ask you.

20:19.509 --> 20:22.596
I started it,
I will continue it until it is over.

20:23.597 --> 20:24.431
Good

20:26.934 --> 20:27.768
Good

20:28.936 --> 20:30.437
We will attack tonight.

20:30.938 --> 20:33.523
Call me, Do Young,
as soon as you get the sales manager.

20:33.607 --> 20:36.109
I will wait in front of the hospital
and admit her as soon as she calls.

20:36.193 --> 20:37.444
Concept

20:37.527 --> 20:39.238
Why wait and enter immediately?

20:39.321 --> 20:42.532
If there are thugs
with the sales manager, they will be exposed.

20:42.616 --> 20:44.785
This means they will be in the hospital as well.

20:45.285 --> 20:47.829
Wouldn't it be dangerous
for Mr. Li to go alone?

20:48.330 --> 20:49.498
He will be fine. It's fast.

20:51.333 --> 20:52.251
Isn't it faster?

20:52.334 --> 20:55.963
To unite in getting rid of Jeon Min Kim together
and then go in and take Jang Do Im?

20:56.713 --> 20:58.674
And if he knows of our move,

20:58.757 --> 21:01.009
Myung Gil Kim will release all his thugs.

21:01.510 --> 21:02.511
We will then perish.

21:02.594 --> 21:04.388
They outnumber us.

21:04.888 --> 21:07.599
We have to disperse and target them at the same time.

21:08.558 --> 21:11.645
It's a risk,
but it's the only way we can win.

21:14.898 --> 21:19.069
I'll move around on a motorcycle so I'll be fine.
I'll run away if the situation gets worse.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.115
What should we do?

21:24.449 --> 21:25.701
Can you drive a motorcycle?

21:26.618 --> 21:27.703
no

21:27.786 --> 21:29.288
The motorcycle is also fast.

21:29.871 --> 21:30.706
What

21:31.623 --> 21:32.749
Nothing, sir.

21:34.042 --> 21:37.004
I'll take them with me. I may need them in the hospital.

21:38.005 --> 21:40.882
I'll go with Mr. Lee.
I can drive a motorcycle.

21:42.009 --> 21:42.843
Good

21:43.677 --> 21:44.511
Let's eat now.

21:45.095 --> 21:46.346
Yes sir.

21:46.430 --> 21:47.973
Can you drive a motorcycle?

21:48.557 --> 21:49.725
- Yes.
- Of what kind?

21:50.225 --> 21:51.518
I ride regular bicycles.

21:52.394 --> 21:54.646
Don't you find that we have similarities?

21:55.605 --> 21:56.732
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

21:57.649 --> 21:58.483
the curse

21:58.567 --> 22:00.235
No need to curse.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.445
Where did you serve, sir?

22:01.528 --> 22:03.155
Let's not talk about the army.

22:03.864 --> 22:05.032
You must stop.

22:05.741 --> 22:08.702
“Min Dong.” Bring some soup and rice.

22:09.536 --> 22:10.370
Yes sir.

22:12.331 --> 22:13.165
"Doc."

22:13.665 --> 22:16.209
How are you
fine. It's been a long time, sir.

22:16.293 --> 22:17.377
She is the one who will lead it.

22:17.461 --> 22:18.545
Hello
Hello

22:19.379 --> 22:20.797
I prepared it there.

22:23.133 --> 22:24.593
The new bikes are great.

22:26.887 --> 22:30.515
- Have you ever ridden a racing bike?
- For a short while ago.

22:31.475 --> 22:35.062
You were trained to handle a knife
in the army, right?

22:35.145 --> 22:36.855
- Try catching him.
- No.

22:37.898 --> 22:38.732
truly

22:38.815 --> 22:39.900
Yes

22:43.904 --> 22:44.946
They tried to catch him.

22:45.030 --> 22:48.575
We don't intend to use knives, sir.

22:50.243 --> 22:53.413
-Who asked you to use a knife?
-Didn't you offer us a knife?

22:53.997 --> 22:55.207
Are you answering me?

22:55.290 --> 22:56.500
I will behave, sir!

22:59.127 --> 23:02.881
You must both learn how to use a knife
to find out how the stabber thinks.

23:02.964 --> 23:04.925
You must read their minds to defeat them.

23:05.008 --> 23:06.134
Concept

23:06.218 --> 23:07.636
Oh God. You scared me.

23:10.097 --> 23:12.224
Let's see. Once you get used to it...

23:14.434 --> 23:15.977
It is one of the fastest bikes.

23:23.360 --> 23:24.319
It suits you.

23:25.695 --> 23:29.950
Sashimi knives do not have
a guard between the handle and the blade.

23:30.033 --> 23:31.827
This blade is not for stabbing.

23:32.744 --> 23:34.871
Look, if you stab it hard...

23:36.498 --> 23:39.501
Your hand will slide forward
and the blade will hurt your fingers.

23:39.584 --> 23:41.002
To stab deeply into it,

23:41.086 --> 23:42.796
They should support the knife from behind.

23:43.463 --> 23:44.297
thus

23:45.757 --> 23:47.092
Your hand will not slip.

23:48.385 --> 23:50.804
If someone points a knife like this,
what is he aiming at?

23:50.887 --> 23:53.390
He will try to cut the hand or wrist.

23:53.473 --> 23:56.101
correct. The cut will not be deep.

23:56.685 --> 24:00.021
This is like someone boxing
from a distance with light punches.

24:00.105 --> 24:01.398
Understood

24:04.693 --> 24:06.695
once again! Acceptable performance.

24:07.988 --> 24:09.906
Relax and keep rolling.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.834
What about people who use both hands?

24:20.917 --> 24:22.544
Their intent is to kill, right?

24:25.589 --> 24:28.175
As long as you press with your thumbs,

24:28.258 --> 24:30.343
Your hand will not slip easily.

24:31.136 --> 24:34.139
If someone holds his knife this way,
it means he is an expert.

24:34.222 --> 24:36.516
Strike at the same speed
you are moving toward her.

24:36.600 --> 24:37.851
- With less force.
- Lightly.

24:37.934 --> 24:38.894
- Like that.
- Yes.

24:47.110 --> 24:48.153
Yes, like that!

25:01.750 --> 25:03.502
If you cheat, I'll kill you.

25:04.294 --> 25:06.087
What do you do? Distribute the paper.

25:06.171 --> 25:08.215
the curse. Let me have it.
- Hey, show me.

25:10.759 --> 25:11.927
Won't you welcome me?

25:18.767 --> 25:20.810
You fucking bastards!

25:39.120 --> 25:40.372
Let's wait here.

26:05.564 --> 26:06.690
to stop

26:07.732 --> 26:10.068
- Which unit do you visit?
- Unit 603.

26:12.737 --> 26:14.072
There's a car coming.

26:31.214 --> 26:32.257
There is someone.

26:32.882 --> 26:33.717
What do we do?

26:35.635 --> 26:36.469
Wait now.

26:41.266 --> 26:42.851
"Incoming call"

26:42.934 --> 26:44.394
the curse

27:06.207 --> 27:07.042
Thank you sir.

27:08.043 --> 27:11.129
Listen to me while you drink.
For your lives in this field,

27:11.212 --> 27:13.131
You must give up everything you have.

27:14.257 --> 27:15.550
Your fist.

27:15.634 --> 27:16.509
Your soul.

27:17.010 --> 27:17.844
Your dreams.

27:18.595 --> 27:19.888
Dispense with it and you will live.

27:21.181 --> 27:23.850
But do not neglect your friends and family.

27:23.933 --> 27:26.269
It is better for a person to die
than to live such a life.

27:27.437 --> 27:28.688
Your order, sir.

27:29.898 --> 27:31.566
When I enter the hospital,

27:31.650 --> 27:34.152
I ask you to run away, so do not argue with me and run away.

27:34.235 --> 27:36.071
I'll take care of it inside.

27:38.823 --> 27:40.075
Concept

27:41.159 --> 27:45.205
Didn't you just tell us
not to abandon our friends and family?

27:45.789 --> 27:46.956
I am a criminal

27:47.040 --> 27:50.418
We may be in the same boat now
but we are not family.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.629
We will not meet again after this mission is completed.

27:52.712 --> 27:55.757
So don't think about getting romantically involved with me, okay?

28:01.554 --> 28:02.639
Do you understand?

28:03.765 --> 28:04.933
Understood, sir.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.103
Understood, sir.

28:26.579 --> 28:27.664
Jun Min Kim has arrived.

28:33.461 --> 28:34.796
What will you do?

28:36.506 --> 28:38.341
What are we going to do, Mr. Lee?

28:39.342 --> 28:40.301
can you hear me

28:40.927 --> 28:42.262
Answer me please.

28:42.762 --> 28:43.805
I will attack.

29:00.405 --> 29:02.282
What a scoundrel!

29:14.711 --> 29:15.754
Call the hospital!

29:32.771 --> 29:35.815
You bastard! Oh damn!

29:36.900 --> 29:37.901
die!

29:37.984 --> 29:40.236
Oh damn! You bastard!

29:40.320 --> 29:43.239
Screw you, asshole!

29:45.492 --> 29:46.367
"Do ho."

29:46.451 --> 29:48.953
Put that motherfucker in the trunk.

29:49.579 --> 29:50.997
Put him in the trunk quickly!

29:54.459 --> 29:55.293
What is this

29:57.420 --> 29:59.214
- What is this?
- That scoundrel!

30:05.553 --> 30:06.971
- You bastard.
- Come on!

30:21.986 --> 30:22.821
Are you well

30:41.047 --> 30:42.632
"Main building, sick room"

30:42.715 --> 30:44.843
"Do Young"

30:46.761 --> 30:47.637
Okay

30:50.098 --> 30:50.974
Are you well

30:52.225 --> 30:53.059
Good

31:02.861 --> 31:04.070
Let's go

31:04.153 --> 31:05.280
Okay sir.

31:40.356 --> 31:41.232
It's Jang Do Im.

31:46.863 --> 31:48.573
"Bitcoin"

31:48.656 --> 31:50.408
Yes, to increase your value.

31:54.704 --> 31:55.538
Damn

32:06.090 --> 32:07.675
Let's go

32:07.759 --> 32:09.052
Damn

32:23.441 --> 32:24.275
Good. Wait.

32:25.944 --> 32:26.861
Moment

32:27.528 --> 32:28.655
Leave me. the curse

32:32.283 --> 32:33.201
Damn

32:36.704 --> 32:37.997
Who are you

33:08.027 --> 33:09.237
- Let's go.
- Okay, sir.

33:15.284 --> 33:16.202
I notice

33:38.307 --> 33:41.394
“We brought Jang Do Im
and take him to Do Young's store.”

33:59.954 --> 34:01.581
- You have arrived.
- Hello, sir.

34:09.839 --> 34:10.840
Can you put it here?

34:10.923 --> 34:11.841
Yes sir

34:14.135 --> 34:15.261
One, two

34:15.344 --> 34:16.345
Pay attention.

34:16.846 --> 34:18.097
Willah

34:19.474 --> 34:20.600
Where is the salt?

34:20.683 --> 34:21.517
salt

34:23.144 --> 34:24.062
He's in the office.

34:25.229 --> 34:26.397
Prepare salt water.

34:27.607 --> 34:29.567
Pour out a bucket and pour all the salt.

34:29.650 --> 34:30.777
Yes sir.

34:30.860 --> 34:31.944
- Come on.
- Okay.

34:32.028 --> 34:32.987
At the corner.

34:33.071 --> 34:33.988
Okay sir.

34:35.490 --> 34:36.532
Damn

34:43.581 --> 34:45.083
Are you okay, Hyun Joo?

34:45.166 --> 34:46.918
Yes, are you okay?

34:47.001 --> 34:47.960
Yes

34:49.670 --> 34:51.672
We came with "Jang Do Im".

34:52.173 --> 34:53.466
- True.
- And “Jun Min Kim”?

34:53.549 --> 34:56.344
I was outside so I didn't see what happened,
but he said he had it.

34:56.427 --> 34:59.472
- Well.
- Did he kill him?

35:05.728 --> 35:07.230
Let's hurry and prepare the salt water.

35:07.313 --> 35:08.731
- Find him.
- Okay.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.445
I think we could use this.

35:14.529 --> 35:16.030
- And the water?
- I saw water at the bottom.

35:16.114 --> 35:16.948
Let's go down.

35:17.031 --> 35:18.157
Let's go, Hyun Joo.

35:32.797 --> 35:33.756
Yes sir.

35:33.840 --> 35:36.676
I'll be there in five minutes,
so shake his confidence.

35:36.759 --> 35:38.010
And I want too

35:39.095 --> 35:41.430
To show Hyun Joo and the two young men what is happening.

35:55.611 --> 35:56.779
What is the matter

35:58.197 --> 35:59.824
He wants Hyun Joo to see what's going on.

35:59.907 --> 36:00.867
Why

36:03.619 --> 36:05.413
Oh God. Will Hyun Joo bear this?

36:07.415 --> 36:09.167
Hello sir. from here

36:23.973 --> 36:26.184
to stop. Show us the stairs.

36:26.267 --> 36:27.894
There are no cameras on that side.

36:28.519 --> 36:29.353
why not

36:29.437 --> 36:30.771
There is no reason.

36:33.316 --> 36:34.817
Are you kidding me?

36:35.776 --> 36:40.281
Well, security cameras outside in front of the building?

36:40.865 --> 36:42.783
We should go to the police to check it out.

36:51.542 --> 36:52.960
How is Jun Min?

36:54.378 --> 36:55.588
He's unconscious, sir.

36:56.797 --> 36:58.299
Go to the building manager,

36:58.382 --> 37:00.760
And find the scoundrels
who got rid of John Min.

37:00.843 --> 37:01.677
Your order, sir.

37:03.095 --> 37:05.139
- Let's put it here.
- I'll pour it.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.349
How much do I pour?

37:06.849 --> 37:09.018
Didn't he ask us to pour it all out?

37:09.101 --> 37:10.228
Isn't it too much?

37:11.562 --> 37:14.315
Let's pour it all out. You were the one who received his orders.

37:14.398 --> 37:15.441
Good

37:18.736 --> 37:19.612
What are you doing?

37:19.695 --> 37:21.155
We were asked to prepare salt water.

37:26.953 --> 37:27.870
Brine

37:27.954 --> 37:29.080
Here you go sir.

37:33.209 --> 37:34.502
Come and see.

37:36.170 --> 37:37.004
Why

37:37.088 --> 37:38.673
It's Mr. Choi's orders.

37:46.472 --> 37:50.184
I hate people who open their mouths and then close them.

37:51.310 --> 37:55.773
So when you decided to tell me everything,
you shook your head.

37:57.275 --> 38:01.028
If you say you'll speak and then back down,
I'll cut your lips off with a knife.

38:01.612 --> 38:02.446
Concept

38:40.651 --> 38:42.236
You won't talk, will you?

39:29.325 --> 39:30.159
Wait.

39:49.720 --> 39:50.721
“Hyun Joo.”

40:05.152 --> 40:06.695
Why did you ask me to watch that?

40:07.488 --> 40:10.616
Myung-gil
has probably started looking for Jang Do-im now.

40:10.699 --> 40:12.660
We're running out of time.

40:13.494 --> 40:16.288
There is something I want to teach you.

40:17.123 --> 40:18.499
What are you talking about?

40:18.582 --> 40:21.252
This matter will only be resolved by the death of one of them.

40:21.335 --> 40:23.754
It is not guaranteed that I will survive.

40:23.838 --> 40:27.174
Then win. Why did you insist that the worst would happen?

40:27.258 --> 40:29.343
- Hyun Joo.
- That's enough.

40:35.141 --> 40:36.100
"Hyun Joo!"

40:39.478 --> 40:42.189
- Catch Hyun Joo, please, Mr. Oh.
- Yes, sir.

40:43.399 --> 40:45.109
Oh God. What a girl.

40:49.155 --> 40:50.906
- “Gun-woo.”
- Yes, sir.

40:52.825 --> 40:53.701
that

40:55.744 --> 40:57.163
Al Bekma eventually

40:58.164 --> 41:00.166
To confront Myung-gil.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.127
Can you protect others?

41:04.962 --> 41:06.672
I will protect them until the end.

41:07.882 --> 41:09.049
Well, thank you

41:10.593 --> 41:14.638
We are running out of time, so let me give you some information.

41:18.225 --> 41:22.354
It takes two requirements to defeat a monolithic organization.

41:24.273 --> 41:26.650
Distraction and separation.

41:28.319 --> 41:30.779
People tend to trust
those they know well

41:30.863 --> 41:32.490
And they sympathize with them.

41:34.575 --> 41:36.827
Without gaining the individual's trust,

41:38.287 --> 41:40.331
You will have no hope of breaking up an organization.

41:55.387 --> 41:56.305
Remove it.

42:13.197 --> 42:14.073
"Jang Do Im"?

42:15.115 --> 42:20.788
I think that out of all his men, no one understands Myung-gil better than you.

42:21.997 --> 42:24.917
Myung Gil is a violent and cruel man.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.753
But he is able to read people like an open book.

42:28.671 --> 42:30.256
He also knows how to win their affection.

42:31.090 --> 42:35.219
So Joon Min Kim and In Beom Kang
probably trust him sincerely.

42:35.928 --> 42:37.346
But you are a smart man.

42:37.846 --> 42:39.890
Myung-gil knows more than them.

42:40.641 --> 42:44.812
Myung-gil doesn't genuinely sympathize with anything
deep down.

42:45.312 --> 42:47.106
His understanding and sympathy are cold and rational.

42:47.815 --> 42:52.236
He is always planning how to manipulate people
to serve his interests.

42:52.319 --> 42:55.906
And even though you know that, you worked for him.

42:56.448 --> 42:57.449
Why

42:58.576 --> 43:00.703
The first reason was money.

43:02.079 --> 43:06.625
Myung-gil paid you an annual wage equal to
what a large company pays for 5 years of work.

43:06.709 --> 43:10.087
Graduating from the Police College was your gateway to power.

43:10.170 --> 43:12.673
But you were demoted
and making money became your only option.

43:12.756 --> 43:15.259
This way you save your pride.

43:17.344 --> 43:21.390
But the second reason is your real motivation
for deciding to work for Myung Gil.

43:21.974 --> 43:25.185
You were confident
that you wouldn't let Myung-gil take advantage of you.

43:25.769 --> 43:27.354
I was sure

43:28.230 --> 43:30.232
That a bastard criminal like him wouldn't defeat you.

43:30.816 --> 43:33.652
And if Myung-gil finds a reason to kill you,

43:33.736 --> 43:37.156
All you have to do is flee
to Southeast Asia.

43:38.115 --> 43:40.284
With the money you made working for Myung Gil.

43:43.495 --> 43:45.414
I really like your plan.

43:46.457 --> 43:50.586
But if I take a picture of you right now
and send it to Myung-gil...

43:52.046 --> 43:55.466
You told him that you reported those
you killed to the authorities on Myung-gil's orders.

43:55.549 --> 43:57.259
He will trust me without any doubt.

43:57.343 --> 44:01.597
Because your current situation is enough motivation
to reveal what is hidden.

44:04.183 --> 44:08.312
Then Myung-gil will call back the men
he sent to find you

44:08.395 --> 44:12.733
He releases a group of trolls
to kill you and get rid of you secretly.

44:13.734 --> 44:17.363
Those guys won't give you time
to defend yourself to Myung-gil.

44:17.446 --> 44:18.989
Because he ordered them not to allow this.

44:19.073 --> 44:21.492
Myung-gil doesn't care about the truth.

44:21.992 --> 44:24.536
It is safer to bury two meters deep.

44:24.620 --> 44:29.291
The person who knows most about
the crimes Myung-gil committed,

44:29.375 --> 44:32.211
It's not Jun Min Kim or In Beom Kang,
it's you.

44:36.757 --> 44:38.967
You know Myung-gil as well as I do.

44:40.511 --> 44:45.140
If Myung-gil has any doubt about you...

44:47.768 --> 44:49.353
He will kill you.

44:49.978 --> 44:50.854
Damn

44:53.065 --> 44:53.982
Wait.

44:55.150 --> 44:57.319
Why should I die?

44:58.112 --> 44:59.446
the curse

44:59.530 --> 45:00.406
“Jang Do Im!”

45:02.032 --> 45:03.826
listen to me carefully

45:03.909 --> 45:06.537
If you don't hold yourself together now, you'll actually die!

45:11.417 --> 45:13.085
Tell me everything you know.

45:14.586 --> 45:17.506
In return, I will send you to a safe country

45:17.589 --> 45:19.550
With enough money to last you the rest of your life.

45:20.551 --> 45:22.428
Myung-gil learned everything from me.

45:23.804 --> 45:26.432
I know places he hasn't even heard of.

45:27.057 --> 45:28.142
I promise you

45:32.020 --> 45:35.107
You were going to run away anyway.

45:36.525 --> 45:38.527
And this is your chance.

45:43.824 --> 45:45.033
If I told you,

45:46.535 --> 45:47.828
How much will you give me?

45:50.998 --> 45:52.750
Answer quickly and honestly.

45:59.965 --> 46:03.135
I will get rid of Myung-gil
and Smile Capital once and for all.

46:04.136 --> 46:05.721
Then I will send you to Guam.

46:05.804 --> 46:07.389
I have acquaintances there.

46:08.182 --> 46:11.810
I will support you with everything you need to start a new life there.

46:20.486 --> 46:21.528
Get him something to wear.

46:36.668 --> 46:38.378
How long have you been working for Myung Gil?

46:39.463 --> 46:40.506
since five years

46:40.589 --> 46:42.341
What exactly do you do?

46:42.925 --> 46:46.595
Make sure
his illegal deals are done away from the police,

46:46.678 --> 46:50.182
I am working to ensure that she is not exposed
if the police start investigating her.

46:50.265 --> 46:51.809
And your personal contributions?

46:51.892 --> 46:54.353
In-beom and I handle the minor tasks,

46:54.853 --> 46:58.106
But Mr. Kim's service company is used
for most tasks.

46:58.190 --> 46:59.399
“Minor tasks”?

46:59.483 --> 47:00.317
For example

47:01.944 --> 47:03.987
Filming scandals to threaten others.

47:04.071 --> 47:06.406
You threatened the Aile group, didn't you?

47:09.243 --> 47:10.244
What did you do

47:11.411 --> 47:12.913
Mr. Kim ordered me to do this.

47:12.996 --> 47:15.707
He did not ask you who ordered you, but rather asked you what you did.

47:17.709 --> 47:19.711
I filmed a video for the heir to the Isle group.

47:19.795 --> 47:20.921
from which type

47:21.713 --> 47:23.173
We stripped him of his clothes.

47:24.049 --> 47:25.342
We filmed videos.

47:25.425 --> 47:26.260
Why

47:28.971 --> 47:31.056
Tell me what happened from the beginning.

47:32.724 --> 47:35.686
A 40-storey luxury hotel is
being built in Gangnam.

47:35.769 --> 47:39.064
But after the epidemic spread,
the company responsible for it went bankrupt.

47:39.690 --> 47:41.567
The heir to the Ile Group planned to take it over,

47:41.650 --> 47:43.944
But Mr. Kim learned that they were missing 100 billion.

47:44.027 --> 47:45.279
of whom

47:45.946 --> 47:47.906
The building was neglected for a long time,

47:47.990 --> 47:49.491
So the city of Seoul intervened.

47:49.575 --> 47:51.535
They were looking for someone with cash,

47:51.618 --> 47:56.456
Mr. Kim was playing golf with a member of
the Legislative Assembly, so he recommended him to the governor.

47:57.124 --> 48:01.169
Mr. Kim dreams of building a club in a hotel.

48:03.213 --> 48:06.758
The Seoul City Council told him that
a permit might be allowed to build a club for foreigners only.

48:06.842 --> 48:08.343
Mr. Kim was excited about that.

48:08.427 --> 48:10.554
But the ILE heir tried to back down.

48:10.637 --> 48:13.056
Mr. Kim ordered me to force him to cooperate.

48:13.932 --> 48:16.184
How many people have you filmed videos for?

48:16.935 --> 48:17.769
‫50.‬

48:19.187 --> 48:21.481
Does Myung Gil keep these videos?

48:21.565 --> 48:22.399
Yes

48:23.358 --> 48:25.819
He sees every weakness as a source of income.

48:26.737 --> 48:27.779
It is also

48:28.363 --> 48:30.908
Do not share anything that
may have financial value with anyone.

48:31.575 --> 48:33.368
Where is this data?

48:35.287 --> 48:38.373
Mr. Kim keeps a hard drive
in a small safe in his bedroom.

48:38.957 --> 48:41.376
But it's a German smart safe.

48:41.460 --> 48:44.087
It only opens with a vein on his right arm
when he puts it on.

48:44.171 --> 48:49.343
If any problem arises, he will be able to burn
all its contents remotely using his phone.

48:49.426 --> 48:51.845
There's liquid fuel at the top of the tank.

48:51.929 --> 48:54.723
It will fall and catch fire at the push of a button.

48:54.806 --> 48:57.309
He knows that a solid engine is a double-edged sword.

48:57.893 --> 49:01.229
It serves as a weapon for him
, but it is evidence that incriminates him to the police.

49:02.856 --> 49:05.442
Is that service company a gang?

49:05.984 --> 49:06.818
Yes

49:07.361 --> 49:08.195
How many men does she have?

49:08.779 --> 49:12.157
I think it has 30 men but they call in
more men when needed.

49:12.240 --> 49:13.325
Who is responsible for them?

49:13.909 --> 49:17.579
Mr. Jung is its boss,
and he is the one who kills for Mr. Kim.

49:17.663 --> 49:22.709
He was a mixed martial arts fighter
but was denied it as he beat a fighter to death.

49:22.793 --> 49:24.670
I heard Mr. Kim recruited him.

49:24.753 --> 49:26.380
How do they dispose of bodies?

49:27.130 --> 49:29.383
Mr. Jung is the one who takes care of the bodies.

49:29.466 --> 49:31.134
Well, tell me what you know.

49:32.594 --> 49:36.682
Nearly three years ago,
Mr. Kim flew into a rage while drinking alcohol.

49:36.765 --> 49:38.183
He beat someone to death.

49:39.142 --> 49:40.894
I happened to be near there at the time,

49:40.978 --> 49:43.730
So I took over until Mr. Jung arrived.

49:43.814 --> 49:47.067
Mr. Jung summoned a
three-ton fish truck with an aquarium attached

49:47.150 --> 49:48.443
The body was moved away.

49:48.527 --> 49:52.155
It seemed to me that Mr. Jung was a regular customer
from the way he spoke to the driver.

49:53.031 --> 49:53.907
Do you know his name?

49:55.617 --> 49:57.160
It's hard to remember since it's been so long.

49:59.121 --> 49:59.955
Good

50:00.747 --> 50:02.833
There's a hospital I know in Incheon.

50:02.916 --> 50:05.252
I'll call the ambulance,
so you can get some rest.

50:05.335 --> 50:08.547
Once the job is done and you've taken over the whole thing,

50:09.047 --> 50:11.174
I will issue a passport for you
and arrange a flight for you.

50:15.137 --> 50:17.139
Don't call anyone.

50:18.098 --> 50:19.975
Otherwise Myung Gil Kim will find you.

50:24.771 --> 50:26.690
I'll take your phone.

50:34.156 --> 50:35.782
I'll ask you one last question.

50:38.201 --> 50:40.287
Where is Myung-gil's gold stock?

50:41.705 --> 50:43.248
Only In-beom knows where he is.

50:44.624 --> 50:45.834
What is the nature of their relationship?

50:45.917 --> 50:48.462
In-beom is the only one
Mr. Kim trusts.

50:49.504 --> 50:51.089
They met in prison.

50:51.173 --> 50:53.425
I heard they saved each other's lives
several times.

50:54.009 --> 50:55.802
In-Byeom is willing to die for him.

50:56.928 --> 50:58.972
I don't know everything that's on Mr. Kim's mind.

50:59.473 --> 51:02.184
But he considers In-beom a brother,
I'm sure of that.
