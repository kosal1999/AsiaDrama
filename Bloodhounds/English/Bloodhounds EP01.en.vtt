00:09.759 --> 00:13.179
DECEMBER 2020

00:14.264 --> 00:16.933
BOXING JINNAM

01:27.128 --> 01:28.463
Excuse me?

01:28.546 --> 01:30.048
Put on your mask.

01:30.131 --> 01:31.257
Come on, let's go.

01:31.341 --> 01:33.635
A mask is required on the bus.

01:33.718 --> 01:34.594
Party.

01:34.677 --> 01:36.638
First put on your mask.

01:36.721 --> 01:38.473
Don't tell me what to do!

01:38.556 --> 01:41.601
- There's a sanction...
- I'll decide whether to impose it!

01:41.684 --> 01:44.229
- Don't tell me what to do!
- All right.

01:44.312 --> 01:47.190
Do you drive the bus? So go ahead and drive!

01:47.273 --> 01:48.108
Misery!

01:48.191 --> 01:50.443
First put on your mask.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.070
- Enough!
- Stop it.

01:52.153 --> 01:54.781
- There are other passengers.
- Leave me!

01:54.864 --> 01:56.574
Hands off, you wretch!

01:56.658 --> 01:58.785
- Hands down!
- Excuse me.

01:58.868 --> 02:00.453
And what do you want?

02:00.537 --> 02:03.081
I think it's better if he walks home.

02:03.164 --> 02:06.126
- Bad...
- I'm sorry.

02:06.209 --> 02:07.335
Ugly piece of...

02:07.418 --> 02:09.212
I'm sorry.

02:09.295 --> 02:10.171
I am sorry.

02:11.297 --> 02:12.841
Again, sorry.

02:12.924 --> 02:14.467
No, I don't want to hurt her.

02:14.551 --> 02:15.802
Curse!

02:17.762 --> 02:18.930
Damn you!

02:19.848 --> 02:20.849
My apologies.

02:20.932 --> 02:22.642
What a pain you are.

02:24.769 --> 02:25.687
I apologize.

02:25.770 --> 02:26.938
Yes, damn it.

02:31.192 --> 02:33.278
I apologize for what happened.

02:33.361 --> 02:35.029
- Thank you.
- No problem.

02:36.948 --> 02:38.575
Thanks, you did well.

02:38.658 --> 02:40.160
- A thousand thanks!
- Thank you!

03:21.951 --> 03:23.661
I am sorry.

03:24.162 --> 03:27.123
I didn't know
it would take this long.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.086
I'm sorry this happened.

03:32.170 --> 03:34.756
I'll try for next month.

03:36.925 --> 03:39.719
Can you wait another month?

03:41.262 --> 03:42.555
I'll give you everything back.

03:43.806 --> 03:46.726
Yes, then I'll think about next month.

03:46.809 --> 03:48.478
Okay thanks.

04:27.308 --> 04:30.895
I FOLLOW

04:34.065 --> 04:37.026
<i>In the midst of the crisis due
to the COVID pandemic</i>

04:37.110 --> 04:41.072
<i>a stopped construction site
puts public safety at risk.</i>

04:41.155 --> 04:44.659
<i> The construction of the building was blocked twice </i>

04:44.742 --> 04:46.786
<i>because a bricklayer was positive.</i>

04:46.869 --> 04:49.580
<i>The construction company in charge has failed</i>

04:49.664 --> 04:52.292
<i>and this havoc remains
which disfigures the city.</i>

04:52.375 --> 04:54.752
<i>Seoul must act immediately
to find a solution.</i>

05:02.051 --> 05:05.179
In the United States, they laid off
more than 3.5 million employees

05:05.263 --> 05:06.681
of hotels since mid-year.

05:06.764 --> 05:09.517
I say this because for at least three
or four years

05:09.600 --> 05:12.520
there is no foreign company
that will want to buy the hotel.

05:12.603 --> 05:15.857
- And not even Korean.
-You say it as if it were a fact.

05:15.940 --> 05:18.026
I have friends who will be future leaders

05:18.109 --> 05:19.652
of the 50 most important companies.

05:19.736 --> 05:22.822
We talked about it
and this is the conclusion,

05:22.905 --> 05:24.449
so I would say it's true.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.159
On the contrary,

05:27.201 --> 05:28.536
it's a true fact.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.456
You did well to deal with me, Vice President.

05:32.040 --> 05:32.957
Director Hong.

05:34.083 --> 05:37.211
Our bank financed
the property with 400 billion.

05:37.712 --> 05:40.715
Saying it returns 300 billion
is not a deal.

05:40.798 --> 05:43.176
You will have to suffer some losses.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.053
How do you do business?

05:45.636 --> 05:47.013
I don't do business,

05:47.597 --> 05:48.723
I'm a banker.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.809
Therefore, director, vice president,

05:51.893 --> 05:53.811
the reason you are here is...

05:53.895 --> 05:54.729
Yes.

05:54.812 --> 05:58.024
The mayor wants to finish
the construction as soon as possible

05:58.107 --> 05:59.400
for security reasons.

05:59.484 --> 06:01.361
But he's as stubborn as a donkey!

06:01.444 --> 06:04.697
Vice President, are you calling me an ass?

06:04.781 --> 06:07.116
Tell me when you weren't stubborn.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.293
I'm sorry for my late.

06:18.544 --> 06:21.714
President Kim Myeong-gil,
who I told you about before.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.257
Welcome.

06:23.341 --> 06:26.928
Representative Seo Woo-hyeon introduced us ,

06:27.011 --> 06:28.596
an acquaintance of the mayor.

06:29.347 --> 06:30.598
Kim Myeong-gil.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.852
KIM Myeong-GIL

06:35.937 --> 06:37.814
I contact you separately.

06:38.439 --> 06:39.273
Right.

06:44.028 --> 06:45.029
Kim Myeong-gil.

06:55.706 --> 06:58.543
Can I ask you what you do?

06:59.127 --> 07:00.878
Especially about investments.

07:00.962 --> 07:05.258
When people ask me,
I try to help however I can.

07:05.758 --> 07:08.052
Do you have a credit granting business?

07:09.095 --> 07:12.223
Excuse me, but did you bring us a loan shark?

07:13.057 --> 07:15.476
Chairman Kim deals with various things.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.020
It's not a place for loan sharks, don't you think?

07:20.398 --> 07:23.109
You are President Hong Woo-geun's eldest son , yes?

07:24.152 --> 07:27.447
As a young man, I worked
for President Bang in Myeong-dong.

07:27.530 --> 07:30.575
She won't remember him
because he was small.

07:30.658 --> 07:32.785
When the financial crisis hit,

07:32.869 --> 07:35.872
the Iil Group,
open for 50 years, almost went bankrupt

07:35.955 --> 07:37.915
because he didn't have six billion.

07:37.999 --> 07:40.168
So, President Hong Woo-geun

07:40.251 --> 07:43.463
went to ask my boss,
President Bang, for help.

07:43.546 --> 07:47.550
He begged him to save the company
at any cost.

07:47.633 --> 07:51.762
President Bang was moved
by his passion and sincerity.

07:53.097 --> 07:57.852
I took a bag with six billion won
in cash and came to his house.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.688
I remember his mother preparing me

08:00.771 --> 08:03.733
some excellent melons
to express gratitude.

08:05.109 --> 08:08.070
Dirty money does not exist.
It can be used with criminal intent

08:08.154 --> 08:10.740
but when the cause is right,
it's clean money.

08:11.324 --> 08:14.202
I'm here to help.

08:17.955 --> 08:20.458
If you update me on the negotiations...

08:21.125 --> 08:23.878
They have two different numbers in mind.

08:23.961 --> 08:27.215
- We were talking about it.
- I understand. How much is it?

08:27.298 --> 08:28.883
One hundred billion won.

08:32.929 --> 08:36.599
Do you intend to personally follow
the hotel's activities, director?

08:37.099 --> 08:39.769
I did a master's degree in hotel management
in Switzerland

08:39.852 --> 08:41.437
and I worked in Hong Kong.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.648
I understand. He is very prepared.

08:45.233 --> 08:48.444
Would you be okay
with me making an investment?

08:50.404 --> 08:51.239
By how much?

08:51.322 --> 08:52.281
Beh,

08:52.865 --> 08:55.785
100 billion missing,
I would invest that amount.

08:59.330 --> 09:02.124
I also invest more, if necessary.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.167
And the conditions?

09:03.251 --> 09:05.920
Well, there are only three.

09:06.504 --> 09:12.176
I would like to build a small casino
on the top floor of the hotel.

09:12.260 --> 09:14.804
His dream is to manage a hotel,

09:14.887 --> 09:17.431
mine is to open a casino.

09:18.432 --> 09:23.563
Then, you will help me make sure
there is a lounge bar on the ground floor.

09:23.646 --> 09:27.358
Finally, if there were such a thing as COVID again ,

09:27.441 --> 09:30.820
we will give the hotel spaces
for quarantine

09:30.903 --> 09:33.406
of those who have no money, for free.

09:34.490 --> 09:38.494
In difficult times,
we must help each other.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.747
This is how we create a better world.

09:46.043 --> 09:47.712
I'm willing

09:48.462 --> 09:51.424
to pay the
100 billion quota also tomorrow morning.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.566
How did it go?

10:09.984 --> 10:11.819
- Well.
- Did they take the bait?

10:12.987 --> 10:15.740
- Yes.
- Hurray!

10:16.407 --> 10:20.286
And go! Now I have to think
about how to furnish the bar.

10:20.369 --> 10:22.913
You don't go to the bar
to admire the decor.

10:22.997 --> 10:27.043
We go to meet girls.
Take care of finding beautiful girls.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.128
Mind your own business, idiot.

10:29.211 --> 10:32.214
Maybe someone as beautiful as you
could also speak well.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.884
What do you know? Imbecile!

10:37.637 --> 10:39.013
I want to clean my face.

10:43.392 --> 10:44.226
Ecco.

10:59.742 --> 11:00.785
Let's go.

11:05.206 --> 11:06.707
E al Seongeun Building?

11:06.791 --> 11:10.002
The tenants have no ties
to the police or prosecutor's office.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.379
Not even friends and relatives?

11:11.462 --> 11:14.340
It only happened once, President.

11:14.423 --> 11:16.550
Maybe they have a policeman lover.

11:16.634 --> 11:18.552
You do your job and he stays calm.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.930
You think about your work.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.098
Jang-do,

11:23.182 --> 11:25.601
address your sister-in-law with respect.

11:26.894 --> 11:28.104
I apologize.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.606
Apologize to me, asshole!

11:31.524 --> 11:33.734
The asshole apologizes, ma'am.

11:33.818 --> 11:36.487
Let's move, I want to drink.

11:36.570 --> 11:37.488
Yes, President.

11:40.491 --> 11:43.536
Welcome to the 2020 KBFC Rookies Tournament.

11:43.619 --> 11:45.663
The arena is usually
packed with spectators

11:45.746 --> 11:48.290
who is cheering, but because of COVID,

11:48.374 --> 11:50.918
today the public is not there.

11:51.001 --> 11:52.378
It's a sad atmosphere.

11:52.461 --> 11:54.797
Yes, there are usually always fans

11:54.880 --> 11:58.008
for all the athletes,
but now there is only silence.

11:58.092 --> 12:01.303
<i>The third round
of Hong Woo-jin's fight begins.</i>

12:01.387 --> 12:02.972
<i>A clash between middleweights.</i>

12:03.055 --> 12:04.598
<i>Hong Woo-jin in rosso,</i>

12:04.682 --> 12:06.684
<i>mentre Jung Jae-hun è in azzurro.</i>

12:06.767 --> 12:07.601
Forza.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.562
<i>- Nice series of shots.
- Yes

12:09.645 --> 12:10.980
<i>Hong leans against the ropes.</i>

12:11.063 --> 12:13.733
<i>Taunt the opponent after hitting them</i>.

12:13.816 --> 12:16.277
<i>It's true, but the opponent doesn't get upset.</i>

12:16.360 --> 12:17.903
<i>- "Prova a colpirmi."
- Sì.</i>

12:17.987 --> 12:19.321
<i>"Dai, provaci."</i>

12:19.405 --> 12:20.239
<i>Che botta!</i>

12:20.322 --> 12:21.157
Forza.

12:21.240 --> 12:24.285
<i>- A clean jab.
- And another one in the face!</i>

12:24.368 --> 12:26.537
<i>He knocked him out! Hong Woo-jin!</i>

12:26.620 --> 12:29.039
<i>A double right
followed by a one-two.</i>

12:29.123 --> 12:31.959
<i>Yes, what great footwork.
He's a real talent.</i>

12:32.042 --> 12:33.294
<i>Ed è KO!</i>

12:33.836 --> 12:37.465
<i>The next match
is Kim Gun-woo vs. Kin Rae-hyeon.</i>

12:37.548 --> 12:39.550
<i>Kim Gun-woo, la promessa, è in azzurro.</i>

12:39.633 --> 12:42.511
<i>Kim Gun-woo
waits for the opportunity with his guard up.</i>

12:42.595 --> 12:43.512
<i>Bravo!</i>

12:43.596 --> 12:45.556
<i>- What a shot!
- He's on his knees!</i>

12:45.639 --> 12:48.142
<i>A precision shot to the solar plexus...</i>

12:48.225 --> 12:50.186
<i>- It matches if conclude which.
- Sì.</i>

12:50.269 --> 12:51.729
<i>Un colpo ed è KO.</i>

12:51.812 --> 12:54.940
<i>Kim Gun-woo continua
a vincere con un colpo.</i>

12:55.024 --> 12:56.066
<i>- It's flawless.
- Yes

12:56.150 --> 12:58.068
<i>He is an athlete who promises well.</i>

12:58.652 --> 13:00.446
<i>The situation is heating up.</i>

13:00.529 --> 13:02.281
<i>- It's on the corner.
- He closed it.</i>

13:05.242 --> 13:08.245
<i>He pushed him to the ground.
She threw him to the ground.</I>

13:08.329 --> 13:09.872
<i>È fallo.</i>

13:09.955 --> 13:11.665
<i>- It's true.</i>
- It was him...

13:11.749 --> 13:13.375
<i>- He is too agitated.
- Yes

13:13.459 --> 13:15.044
- Boxing!
- Force!

13:15.544 --> 13:18.297
<i>He moves his hair,
Hong is really histrionic.</i>

13:18.380 --> 13:20.257
<i>- Already.
- Provokes the opponent.</i>

13:20.341 --> 13:21.342
<i>Schivata.</i>

13:21.967 --> 13:23.260
<i>Guardate come schiva!</i>

13:25.763 --> 13:27.807
<i>Again... And it hits! He goes down.</i>

13:27.890 --> 13:29.850
<i>It's Hong Woo-jin's specialty.</i>

13:29.934 --> 13:32.144
- Yes.
- Double jab and hook!</i>

13:32.228 --> 13:33.979
<i>Hong Woo-jin, il marine.</i>

13:34.063 --> 13:36.398
<i>Hong Woo-jin vince di nuovo.</i>

13:37.358 --> 13:39.860
<i>Adesso, Kim Gun-woo contro Lee Yong-gyu.</i>

13:41.737 --> 13:44.365
<i>Kim Gun-woo, in red,
has a massive physique.</i>

13:44.448 --> 13:45.783
- Yes.
- Nice dodge.</i>

13:45.866 --> 13:48.452
<i>- His strength is melee.
- Yes

13:48.536 --> 13:51.372
<i>He knows how to handle himself well in hand-to-hand combat.</i>

13:51.455 --> 13:53.541
<i>One shot and dodge.</i>

13:53.624 --> 13:56.836
<i>- Liver shot!
- Knocked out with one blow!</i>

13:56.919 --> 13:59.088
<i>- A win for the fegato.
- Yes.</i>

13:59.171 --> 14:01.382
<i>At the time, I was good like that too.</i>

14:01.465 --> 14:03.551
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

14:03.634 --> 14:06.053
<i>- Indeed you won the gold.
- It's true.</i>

14:06.720 --> 14:08.514
<i>Kim Gun-woo e Hong Woo-jin.</i>

14:08.597 --> 14:11.267
- Well.
- Who takes home the trophy?

14:11.350 --> 14:14.019
Small movements, short punches,
use your hips!

14:14.103 --> 14:16.856
Watch out for the left hook.
It goes down hard.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.112
SOUTH KOREA NAVIES 1216

14:23.737 --> 14:26.240
But I'm a Marine.

14:27.032 --> 14:28.492
Watch out for the left hook.

14:28.576 --> 14:30.911
I am an invincible marine. Invincible!

14:30.995 --> 14:34.081
If he beats you bloody and you cry,
I'll kill you.

14:39.044 --> 14:40.254
- Force!
- Force!

14:43.632 --> 14:45.801
Good match. At the corners.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.891
<i>Fantastic encounters so far.</i>

14:51.974 --> 14:55.686
<i>Kim Gun-woo, the promise,
fights differently.</i>

14:55.769 --> 14:59.440
<i>Exactly. Kim Gun-woo
is good at attacking his opponent.</i>

14:59.523 --> 15:00.983
<i>Sì.</i>

15:01.066 --> 15:06.030
<i>Instead, Hong Woo-jin keeps his distance
and has a phenomenal counterattack.</i>

15:06.113 --> 15:09.116
<i>Yeah, Hong Woo-jin
has fun during meetings.</i>

15:09.199 --> 15:10.034
<i>Sì.</i>

15:10.117 --> 15:13.037
<i>Instead the opponent is serious and does not provoke...</i>

15:13.120 --> 15:15.831
<i>Attack! He's cornering him!</i>

15:15.915 --> 15:18.500
<i>Will Hong Woo-jin scam her?</i>

15:18.584 --> 15:20.002
<i>He managed to free himself.</i>

15:20.085 --> 15:24.131
<i>- Yes, Hong Woo-jin is very fast.
- Exactly.</i>

15:24.214 --> 15:26.425
<i>But Kim Gun-woo is also a middleweight...</i>

15:26.508 --> 15:28.594
<i>And try a powerful hook!</i>

15:29.219 --> 15:31.055
<i>- Yes.
- He blocked it. Now the stomach.</i>

15:31.138 --> 15:33.015
<i>Kim Gun-woo si difende bene.</i>

15:33.098 --> 15:35.351
- Yes.
- It's a rock

15:35.434 --> 15:37.770
<i>His guard is up.</i>

15:37.853 --> 15:38.687
<i>Montante!</i>

15:38.771 --> 15:40.481
<i>- Here.
-He scored.</I>

15:40.564 --> 15:42.149
<i>Yes, and so.</i>

15:42.232 --> 15:43.484
<i>Enthralling clash.</i>

15:43.567 --> 15:44.902
Hook! And dodge!</i>

15:44.985 --> 15:46.862
<i>Ora tocca a Hong Woo-jin.</i>

15:46.946 --> 15:50.074
<i>Hong Woo-jin continua a pressare.</i>

15:50.908 --> 15:53.827
<i>- Left hook!
- An accident. Will he recover?</i>

15:53.911 --> 15:55.996
<i>- And it goes down.
- It's on the carpet!

15:56.080 --> 15:57.623
<i>- È al tappeto.</i>
- Due...

15:57.706 --> 16:01.085
<i>With a blow to the stomach
the consequences come later.</i>

16:01.168 --> 16:03.712
<i>- It's true.
- It takes five seconds.</i>

16:03.796 --> 16:04.797
<i>Alzati! Woo-jin!</i>

16:04.880 --> 16:06.340
Six seven...

16:06.423 --> 16:07.800
- He gets up.
- Yes.

16:07.883 --> 16:09.802
<i>- He has already recovered.
- Yes...</i>

16:09.885 --> 16:10.803
<i>Sì.</i>

16:10.886 --> 16:12.930
<i>This is farà male.</i>

16:13.013 --> 16:15.307
<i>- You'll hear it soon.
- Right.</i>

16:17.226 --> 16:18.060
Forza.

16:20.145 --> 16:22.606
Forza!

16:48.173 --> 16:49.008
Forza.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.052
Come on, get on with it.

16:53.721 --> 16:54.888
Son of a bitch.

16:57.891 --> 16:59.893
Come on, come on!

17:01.770 --> 17:03.105
<i>Will it fall?</i>

17:03.188 --> 17:05.357
<i>- Kim Gun-woo ci pensa.</i>
- Forza!

17:05.441 --> 17:07.735
<i>He's gone! Will he strike?</i>

17:07.818 --> 17:11.155
Stop! One two...

17:11.238 --> 17:13.574
<i>It must have hurt a lot.</i>

17:13.657 --> 17:15.409
<i>- The tactic went wrong.</i>
- KO.

17:15.492 --> 17:16.410
<i>Esatto.</i>

17:16.493 --> 17:19.121
<i>Kim Gun-woo scored
and ended the match,</i>

17:19.204 --> 17:24.293
<i>again with his single shot,
this time to the side.</i>

17:28.464 --> 17:29.590
Are you OK?

17:30.257 --> 17:32.843
I have tarnished the honor of the Marines.

17:33.427 --> 17:35.512
Everyone goes down
with a shot to the liver.

17:36.722 --> 17:37.639
I'm leaving.

17:38.640 --> 17:39.892
And to eat?

17:40.601 --> 17:41.810
There's still COVID.

17:42.394 --> 17:45.564
I just lost, at least buy me lunch.

18:01.455 --> 18:02.915
Go home and order.

18:06.126 --> 18:06.960
Ciao.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.853
What? Why? What?

18:25.771 --> 18:26.855
Shall we eat something?

18:27.606 --> 18:29.274
Why should I come with you?

18:29.858 --> 18:32.861
I wanted to go eat bacon.
Do you want?

18:35.531 --> 18:36.615
Do you feel sorry for me?

18:37.157 --> 18:37.991
No.

18:38.075 --> 18:40.202
Tell that to the losers you knocked out.

18:40.285 --> 18:41.912
They returned home.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.248
Ugh.

18:56.677 --> 18:59.304
- The prize was ten million?
- Yes.

19:00.264 --> 19:03.392
So why bacon?
Let's have a steak.

19:03.475 --> 19:06.145
- I only want to spend 50,000 won.
- Why?

19:06.228 --> 19:07.980
I have to give the rest to my mother.

19:08.063 --> 19:10.107
- Do you owe her money?
- No.

19:10.190 --> 19:11.066
Then why?

19:11.567 --> 19:13.527
I pay you the bar rent.

19:14.319 --> 19:15.529
You are a good son.

19:16.196 --> 19:17.614
If you spend 10,000 more,

19:17.698 --> 19:20.284
there is a buffet
that costs 29,000 won per head.

19:20.367 --> 19:22.035
It's great, they have Korean beef.

19:22.119 --> 19:24.079
- Really? Where?
- I'm joking, stupid.

19:25.455 --> 19:27.583
How do they serve it at 29,000 won?

19:28.584 --> 19:30.169
Have you only done boxing in life?

19:31.378 --> 19:33.755
It's good. He takes out another 10,000 won.

19:48.061 --> 19:48.896
Let's go.

19:50.397 --> 19:51.982
Got a strong left hook, huh?

19:52.482 --> 19:56.028
I used to train with a tire
when I worked in the landfill.

19:56.111 --> 19:57.279
Only the left one?

19:58.363 --> 19:59.781
Why only the left one?

19:59.865 --> 20:01.867
Did you only train with your left foot?

20:01.950 --> 20:03.785
With both of them.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.537
And why is the left strong?

20:05.621 --> 20:08.874
- The right is stronger.
- Why did you use the left?

20:08.957 --> 20:11.293
I couldn't find the right moment
for the right.

20:12.628 --> 20:13.545
What a bully.

20:14.588 --> 20:15.422
How come?

20:15.505 --> 20:18.258
Because you say you knock out
with the left.

20:18.342 --> 20:19.468
Today, yes.

20:19.551 --> 20:21.386
You see? You're a bully.

20:21.970 --> 20:23.347
No not at all.

20:23.430 --> 20:24.306
Turn the meat.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.308
It takes another 30 seconds.

20:26.391 --> 20:28.143
Turn it over immediately.

20:28.227 --> 20:31.355
No, I worked in a place like that.
I know meat.

20:31.438 --> 20:33.607
Man, you've worked all over the place.

20:34.107 --> 20:37.069
- Are you poor?
- Yes, my family lost everything.

20:39.488 --> 20:40.405
How come?

20:42.783 --> 20:45.244
My father was a researcher
in a large company.

20:45.327 --> 20:48.455
He sued for unfair dismissal,
but lost four years later.

20:48.956 --> 20:51.250
Legal fees
turned into debt.

20:52.167 --> 20:54.753
With big companies you lose.
The rich always win.

20:54.836 --> 20:55.879
That's how it is.

20:58.590 --> 21:01.551
- What other jobs have you done?
- Of everything.

21:01.635 --> 21:04.137
I mostly made deliveries with my mother.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.848
You are an eclectic worker.

21:10.519 --> 21:13.438
You can do anything, you're really good at it.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.691
Turn the meat with your right hand.

21:16.233 --> 21:17.567
When did you start boxing?

21:18.277 --> 21:20.195
More or less three years ago.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.281
- When?
- After the military.

21:23.949 --> 21:26.243
I started in sixth grade.

21:26.326 --> 21:27.995
My father was in the national team.

21:28.078 --> 21:31.540
Well, that's cool. What is his name?

21:31.623 --> 21:34.501
Hong Seong-geun.
Bronze at the Barcelona Olympics.

21:34.584 --> 21:36.169
- Ah here.
- Do you know him?

21:36.253 --> 21:37.379
No.

21:38.463 --> 21:40.048
Many boxers know him.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.134
I am sorry.

21:43.593 --> 21:45.429
Did your father teach you?

21:46.138 --> 21:48.765
- We're not very close.
- Why?

21:49.433 --> 21:52.060
He's never happy with what I do.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.354
At my age he had won bronze,

21:54.938 --> 21:57.065
he judges me based on his successes.

21:59.651 --> 22:00.736
At that time,

22:01.611 --> 22:04.948
won the bronze medal at 25?

22:06.074 --> 22:07.617
No, a 27.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.247
How old are you?

22:12.831 --> 22:14.041
Twenty seven.

22:14.624 --> 22:16.668
Well, I apologize then.

22:16.752 --> 22:18.879
I'm 25 years old. I am very sorry.

22:18.962 --> 22:20.756
What the hell, you idiot.

22:20.839 --> 22:21.673
Do you forgive me.

22:21.757 --> 22:22.799
- Oh!
- Yes?

22:22.883 --> 22:24.593
Behave now, huh?

22:24.676 --> 22:26.011
- Certainly.
- Understood?

22:26.720 --> 22:27.888
Yes.

22:27.971 --> 22:28.889
Girala.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.266
No, it takes another minute.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.435
- It's ready, turn it over!
- Not yet.

22:33.518 --> 22:35.771
Damn, you're so stubborn.

22:36.271 --> 22:37.147
The military?

22:37.230 --> 22:40.192
Yes, I said
I boxed after the military.

22:40.275 --> 22:41.568
I know.

22:41.651 --> 22:43.987
I wanted to know what force I was in.

22:44.071 --> 22:47.240
- Be more careful.
- I was in the Marines.

22:48.450 --> 22:49.451
Come on!

22:50.035 --> 22:51.578
I'm a Marine too.

22:52.662 --> 22:53.872
With what degree?

22:53.955 --> 22:56.041
1207°.

22:58.377 --> 23:01.004
Watch out! I 1216th, sir!

23:01.088 --> 23:02.297
Sit down again.

23:02.381 --> 23:03.840
What are you doing? Come on!

23:03.924 --> 23:06.927
- I sit down when she does too.
- Ah...

23:10.389 --> 23:11.973
Marine Kim Gun-woo, signore.

23:12.057 --> 23:13.767
- Yes?
- And where, sir?

23:14.351 --> 23:15.227
In the first department.

23:15.310 --> 23:17.229
Me too! In what battalion, sir?

23:18.438 --> 23:20.732
- Reconnaissance.
- Crazy.

23:21.316 --> 23:24.361
I wanted to get in there too,
but I couldn't, sir.

23:24.444 --> 23:27.072
The Pride of the Marines:
Reconnaissance Wing.

23:27.656 --> 23:29.324
Reconnaissance!

23:30.784 --> 23:33.453
Listen, I want to address you firsthand,
without formalities.

23:34.371 --> 23:35.622
I understand, sir.

23:35.705 --> 23:36.998
Let's be on first terms.

23:37.082 --> 23:38.542
Let's address each other on a first-name basis, sir.

23:38.625 --> 23:39.584
Come on...

23:41.044 --> 23:41.878
Dai.

23:44.714 --> 23:45.549
Yes,

23:46.133 --> 23:48.635
I am very proud to be a Marine.

23:49.302 --> 23:50.137
Why?

23:50.220 --> 23:52.722
I was a bit of a delinquent in Incheon,

23:52.806 --> 23:55.725
but in the Marines
and I met good people

23:55.809 --> 23:57.602
and I realized I was wrong.

23:57.686 --> 24:00.856
Training hard together,
I really enjoyed it.

24:00.939 --> 24:02.274
Delicious.

24:02.858 --> 24:05.360
Waking up early,
going for a run, sweating

24:05.444 --> 24:06.987
and help each other wash.

24:07.070 --> 24:08.738
- Woo-jin.
- Yes?

24:09.948 --> 24:12.451
- Are you one of those crazy marines?
- No.

24:12.534 --> 24:13.702
Break in.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.247
As?

24:19.583 --> 24:21.126
It's like a steak.

24:21.209 --> 24:22.043
Truly?

24:23.670 --> 24:25.338
I'll show you a thing.

24:26.006 --> 24:27.215
- Put three pieces.
- Yes.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.259
- A little spicy.
- Yes.

24:29.342 --> 24:30.677
And kimchi too.

24:35.056 --> 24:37.017
- Marine Kim Gun-woo, sir.
- Yes?

24:41.313 --> 24:43.064
It's the bomb, right?

24:43.607 --> 24:44.983
Would you like something to drink?

24:45.066 --> 24:46.943
Why? Are you afraid of gaining weight?

24:47.027 --> 24:49.237
You perfectionists are two balls.

24:50.363 --> 24:52.616
Ma'am, excuse me!

24:52.699 --> 24:55.744
A bottle of beer and some soju,
please!

24:57.454 --> 24:59.080
How much do the shoes cost?

24:59.581 --> 25:01.124
- 1,200,000 won.
- Really?

25:01.958 --> 25:04.127
They cost the same as the bar rent.

25:04.211 --> 25:05.795
You're such a moron.

25:05.879 --> 25:07.506
They are fake.

25:09.049 --> 25:10.133
They seem real.

25:10.217 --> 25:12.802
The fake ones have a shiny tip.

25:12.886 --> 25:16.014
The real ones are suede.
The finishing is terrible.

25:17.015 --> 25:19.601
If you want them,
I find them better than the real ones.

25:19.684 --> 25:21.853
- Really?
- Like "really"?

25:21.937 --> 25:25.106
As beautiful as the real ones, there are none.

25:26.149 --> 25:28.693
Let's meet, so I'll teach you how to live.

25:28.777 --> 25:31.196
You worked too hard.

25:33.281 --> 25:36.117
Do you know anything about it? It's quite widespread.

25:37.577 --> 25:39.538
“Special COVID Loans.”

25:40.080 --> 25:43.833
I worked in this industry
when I needed money.

25:43.917 --> 25:47.587
- Already.
- Those who are desperate are easier to fool.

25:47.671 --> 25:49.965
COVID has pushed many
to desperation.

25:52.175 --> 25:54.970
The loan sharks are rubbing their hands.

25:55.053 --> 25:55.887
How come?

25:55.971 --> 25:58.807
Since they're all trying
to pay the rent,

25:58.890 --> 26:02.686
the loan sharks are there waiting
to take all the money.

26:03.395 --> 26:06.565
My mother is in trouble
with the rent of the bar.

26:07.190 --> 26:09.859
The bar yields less than half of what it used to,

26:09.943 --> 26:12.320
but the landlord wants the same rent.

26:13.530 --> 26:16.199
If we close now,
moving will cost us more.

26:16.283 --> 26:20.537
Let's hold on, otherwise
we have to return it to its previous state.

26:26.793 --> 26:27.627
Second.

26:29.796 --> 26:32.257
Next time
I'll take you somewhere more beautiful.

26:33.300 --> 26:34.134
The steak?

26:34.217 --> 26:36.970
There is a butcher's shop
that also serves as a restaurant.

26:37.053 --> 26:38.305
Do you really mean it, yes?

26:38.388 --> 26:42.934
Do you think I would tell a lie
to a higher ranking Marine?

26:43.018 --> 26:45.395
- In my opinion, yes.
- You do not believe me?

26:45.478 --> 26:47.897
You've already done this several times.

26:47.981 --> 26:50.775
Yes, but I was joking, stupid.

26:50.859 --> 26:52.611
From now on, no lies.

26:53.862 --> 26:54.696
All right.

26:55.864 --> 26:57.073
I am sorry.

26:57.782 --> 26:59.075
I'm dismayed.

26:59.159 --> 27:02.621
This month I thought I would make it,

27:03.121 --> 27:04.748
but I didn't succeed.

27:05.498 --> 27:09.794
Yes, I'll invent something for next month .

27:11.129 --> 27:12.213
I'm sorry.

27:14.049 --> 27:15.967
- We will talk later.
- Mom.

27:16.051 --> 27:17.552
I'll call you tomorrow morning.

27:18.136 --> 27:19.596
Tesoro!

27:20.347 --> 27:21.931
How good!

27:23.892 --> 27:25.935
You were amazing today!

27:26.019 --> 27:28.480
- Did you see the meeting?
- Of course yes.

27:28.563 --> 27:30.857
The commentators
complimented you.

27:30.940 --> 27:33.777
- Truly?
- They said you were flawless.

27:33.860 --> 27:35.278
I want to see it too.

27:36.154 --> 27:37.739
- Mom, wait.
- Yes.

27:37.822 --> 27:39.157
You've been very good.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.326
Second.

27:42.202 --> 27:43.161
What are they?

27:43.787 --> 27:45.997
The prize money. Pay us the rent.

27:48.333 --> 27:49.417
Cielo.

27:50.001 --> 27:51.836
I can't take them.

27:53.588 --> 27:55.423
No, I won to give them to you.

27:59.010 --> 28:02.389
Let's first return the money
we took from uncle.

28:02.472 --> 28:03.348
What?

28:04.557 --> 28:06.601
How do you know?

28:06.685 --> 28:09.979
The uncle is also in difficulty.
Let's give them back quickly.

28:14.609 --> 28:15.568
All right.

28:16.653 --> 28:19.489
But I'll give it back to you with interest.

28:19.572 --> 28:22.575
- All right.
- Thank you.

28:26.287 --> 28:27.414
Let's go, mom.

28:27.497 --> 28:29.207
Oh God, it's cold. Force.

28:29.999 --> 28:31.292
Have you already eaten?

28:31.376 --> 28:32.335
Yes, certainly.

28:32.419 --> 28:33.795
With who?

28:34.379 --> 28:36.548
With the one I challenged in the final.

28:37.507 --> 28:40.802
The one with curly hair?

28:40.885 --> 28:41.845
Yes him.

28:43.930 --> 28:45.056
You ate?

28:45.140 --> 28:46.516
Yes, I already ate.

29:05.201 --> 29:06.035
President.

29:06.619 --> 29:07.537
How is it going?

29:08.329 --> 29:11.750
Tenants owe money
to banks and finance companies,

29:11.833 --> 29:12.834
as she said.

29:13.585 --> 29:16.629
By next week
they will already be our customers.

29:16.713 --> 29:17.547
Beh,

29:18.047 --> 29:19.549
can you this week?

29:20.133 --> 29:22.969
Congressman Seo wants
us to kick them out now.

29:24.387 --> 29:25.513
Of course, President.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.724
Well, let's hurry then.

29:28.224 --> 29:30.268
Jun-min, selling is important.

29:31.060 --> 29:31.895
Yes, sir.

29:36.483 --> 29:37.567
Beom.

29:39.652 --> 29:40.612
Let's get ready.

30:00.215 --> 30:03.301
I'm Yoo In-yeong,
I work for Smile Capital.

30:03.384 --> 30:05.345
We are a financial company

30:05.428 --> 30:07.806
which has the state certification
of excellence.

30:07.889 --> 30:12.143
- Do you have some time to talk?
- Certain.

30:12.769 --> 30:15.897
Lately, the number of customers
has decreased, right?

30:17.398 --> 30:18.316
Already.

30:18.399 --> 30:21.152
You have a mortgage
of 40 million won, right?

30:21.778 --> 30:22.612
Yes.

30:22.695 --> 30:27.075
If you sign, we'll take care
of repaying your debt today.

30:27.158 --> 30:31.412
We have a rate of 5%,
which is lower than the bank's 7%.

30:31.496 --> 30:34.207
And how do you make money?

30:34.290 --> 30:35.416
<i>Beh, sa,</i>

30:35.500 --> 30:38.962
the government has approved
special aid measures

30:39.045 --> 30:43.091
to support small businesses
in difficulty due to COVID.

30:43.174 --> 30:47.136
We won the contract
and thus we lowered the interest.

30:47.220 --> 30:50.098
A 2% difference is not a small thing.

30:50.723 --> 30:53.768
In times like these,
you only win by holding on.

30:55.603 --> 30:58.189
COVID will pass sooner or later.

30:58.731 --> 31:02.777
We would like to help you
keep your business open.

31:05.363 --> 31:07.031
It's an advantage for us,

31:07.115 --> 31:09.325
but above all it is good for her.

31:12.370 --> 31:14.831
- Thank you.
- I'm the one who thanks you.

31:14.914 --> 31:16.332
SMILE CAPITAL
FIRMA YOON SO-YEON

31:20.795 --> 31:22.881
SPARK BOXING GYM

31:32.557 --> 31:33.516
What?

31:35.101 --> 31:38.897
They ate fried chicken
at the gym last night.

31:38.980 --> 31:41.357
<i>It seems that someone was positive.</i>

31:42.066 --> 31:44.152
Do I have to take a swab?

31:44.652 --> 31:45.486
<i>Non serve.</i>

31:45.570 --> 31:50.074
You had the meeting yesterday.
Why are you already at the gym?

31:50.158 --> 31:52.535
- Per allenarmi.
<i>- Gun-woo.</i>

31:53.119 --> 31:54.329
Get some rest.

31:54.954 --> 31:56.205
And then what do I do?

31:56.289 --> 31:58.499
If you do something you don't rest.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.752
Don't do anything and rest.

32:01.502 --> 32:02.337
All right.

32:12.847 --> 32:15.183
GU-NOO

32:22.941 --> 32:24.525
Hello, what are you doing?

32:26.319 --> 32:27.528
sleep

32:27.612 --> 32:28.655
Come?

32:28.738 --> 32:30.031
<i>Dormo.</i>

32:31.115 --> 32:32.241
I don't hear well.

32:32.325 --> 32:33.576
<i>I said I'm sleeping.</i>

32:33.660 --> 32:35.954
I'm sleeping.

32:36.621 --> 32:38.414
Do you want to train?

32:38.498 --> 32:40.291
<i>No.</i>

32:40.833 --> 32:42.126
I am getting bored.

32:42.210 --> 32:45.380
Ugh. You're already nagging first thing in the morning.

32:45.964 --> 32:47.382
Come on, let's meet.

32:49.926 --> 32:52.720
I'll send you the address, come here.

32:53.596 --> 32:54.555
All right.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.031
Fuck!

33:13.783 --> 33:14.617
Hey! Stop!

33:15.201 --> 33:16.452
Asshole!

34:01.581 --> 34:03.416
Everything OK?

34:04.125 --> 34:05.251
One moment...

34:32.695 --> 34:33.529
What do you want?

34:35.114 --> 34:36.449
Why are you following me?

34:37.116 --> 34:38.242
Who sent you?

34:40.328 --> 34:42.538
I wanted to help.

34:42.622 --> 34:43.456
What?

34:44.123 --> 34:44.957
Who were you helping?

34:46.209 --> 34:49.796
I thought someone
was chasing that man.

34:50.713 --> 34:52.840
- Fuck!
- What's up?

34:52.924 --> 34:54.717
That asshole is pretending.

34:54.801 --> 34:56.636
- As?
- Mind your own business.

34:56.719 --> 34:59.347
- All right.
- What an idiot you are.

35:35.091 --> 35:36.092
How come here?

35:36.175 --> 35:40.138
Mi-yeon's surgery yesterday
went well.

35:40.221 --> 35:42.390
Really? How is he now?

35:42.974 --> 35:46.018
Well. She is recovering.

35:48.271 --> 35:49.939
It's thanks to you, President.

35:50.565 --> 35:52.608
If you hadn't helped us,

35:53.109 --> 35:56.237
Mi-yeon would have died.

35:59.323 --> 36:00.158
Have.

36:02.034 --> 36:05.121
My husband recently
moved to a large company

36:05.204 --> 36:07.373
and they paid him severance pay.

36:08.916 --> 36:11.669
I came as soon as we received them

36:11.752 --> 36:14.130
because I wanted to return them to him immediately.

36:17.508 --> 36:19.802
There was no need to give them to me right away.

36:20.761 --> 36:22.263
Think about urgent things.

36:22.847 --> 36:26.475
No, President, please accept them.

36:27.268 --> 36:29.437
So I'm calmer.

36:32.398 --> 36:33.941
Thank you, President.

36:35.818 --> 36:38.362
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

36:41.073 --> 36:42.241
Thank you very much.

36:58.799 --> 37:00.927
MI-YEON'S MOTHER 14 APRIL 2018
20 MILLION

37:06.724 --> 37:12.772
KOREAN ANTIQUES

37:32.625 --> 37:36.629
I saw that bastard Yang Jae-myeong,
he said he was broke,

37:36.712 --> 37:38.005
but I got this from him.

37:42.051 --> 37:43.928
It is worth more than 20 million won.

37:44.011 --> 37:45.054
So what?

37:46.055 --> 37:48.057
I gave Yang Jae-myeong ten million.

37:49.058 --> 37:50.518
Here are the interests.

37:56.148 --> 37:57.191
Does it hurt?

37:57.275 --> 38:00.152
Shit. Yang Jae-myeong and
I got into a fight.

38:00.736 --> 38:04.448
By the way,
we really need to talk now.

38:04.532 --> 38:05.783
Do you want a sweet?

38:06.701 --> 38:09.161
Don't try to change the subject.

38:11.539 --> 38:12.999
Are you thinking of quitting?

38:14.417 --> 38:15.251
Stop what?

38:17.378 --> 38:19.213
To make interest-free loans.

38:19.297 --> 38:20.965
We don't make money.

38:21.465 --> 38:22.633
In what sense?

38:22.717 --> 38:25.845
I always pay you a 30% commission.

38:25.928 --> 38:28.097
Not me. I mean you, grandfather.

38:31.767 --> 38:33.644
Do you know Mi-yeon's mom?

38:34.770 --> 38:35.771
Yes why?

38:35.855 --> 38:39.358
She came first
and gave me everything back in cash.

38:41.193 --> 38:42.320
With interest?

38:44.613 --> 38:45.531
Hyeon-ju.

38:46.240 --> 38:48.909
A sick little girl
was operated on and is doing well.

38:48.993 --> 38:50.536
I gave him the money

38:50.619 --> 38:53.664
and they have not mortgaged the house
as security for the loan.

38:53.748 --> 38:57.168
The child has a home
to return to when they discharge her.

38:58.586 --> 39:00.504
We saved a family.

39:01.339 --> 39:04.216
It is the most valuable interest rate
in the world.

39:07.845 --> 39:08.721
And oh well...

39:08.804 --> 39:12.808
However, when I was looking for Yang Jae-myeong
I found out

39:12.892 --> 39:16.437
that he and his gang
dress like homeless people,

39:16.520 --> 39:19.357
they steal the identity of real homeless people
and make loans in their names.

39:19.440 --> 39:20.983
What people are they?

39:21.067 --> 39:24.403
They were in prison with Yang Jae-myeong,
some convicted felons.

39:24.487 --> 39:26.447
And you decided to go anyway?

39:27.239 --> 39:28.991
Are you coming too next time?

39:29.658 --> 39:34.080
Look, I'll do some research,
maybe I'll find something interesting.

39:34.163 --> 39:35.998
Don't take unnecessary risks.

39:36.665 --> 39:37.500
All right.

39:47.426 --> 39:50.471
DIRECTOR MOON GWANG-MU

39:52.765 --> 39:53.599
Pronto.

39:54.183 --> 39:56.477
Should I call at another time?

39:56.560 --> 39:57.770
No, just tell me.

39:57.853 --> 40:00.856
I wanted to ask you a favor.
You have to find me someone.

40:00.940 --> 40:02.441
Yes, just a moment.

40:03.901 --> 40:04.819
Tell me everything.

40:05.903 --> 40:07.029
"A good person,

40:08.114 --> 40:09.657
security expert,

40:10.741 --> 40:13.619
better if he knows the world of loans."

40:16.330 --> 40:17.748
All right, President.

40:18.249 --> 40:20.835
I will find the most qualified candidates.

40:21.419 --> 40:22.753
Thanks for the help.

40:22.837 --> 40:23.921
Sissir

40:24.422 --> 40:25.256
Watch out!

40:26.715 --> 40:29.051
Mayweather is the best.

40:29.135 --> 40:32.471
But Mayweather seems more like
a businessman than a boxer.

40:32.555 --> 40:36.434
Exact. He does it for the money,
but he's really good at it.

40:37.143 --> 40:39.478
In my opinion, he made real billions.

40:39.562 --> 40:40.771
Does money matter to you?

40:41.856 --> 40:43.357
What matters more than money?

40:43.983 --> 40:45.192
The heart of a boxer.

40:48.320 --> 40:49.196
What's up?

40:51.824 --> 40:52.658
What happens?

40:55.995 --> 40:57.997
- Come on, what is it?
- Nothing, sorry.

40:58.080 --> 40:59.540
Well, you know...

41:00.082 --> 41:02.585
You got all serious suddenly.

41:02.668 --> 41:04.462
I did not expect.

41:04.962 --> 41:06.922
Tell me about the boxer's heart.

41:09.508 --> 41:11.927
I think Manny Pacquiao is the best.

41:12.011 --> 41:12.928
Bye bye!

41:13.012 --> 41:15.306
Dad! Pacquiao! Pa!

41:15.389 --> 41:18.642
Come on, can you let me talk once
without interrupting me?

41:19.393 --> 41:22.104
Excuse me, sir. I won't interrupt her anymore.

41:22.688 --> 41:26.942
I admire Pacquiao's heart.
He never gives up.

41:27.026 --> 41:30.738
This is true,
but Mayweather made more money.

41:30.821 --> 41:34.658
I bet that, thanks to Pacquiao, many
have started dreaming of being boxers.

41:34.742 --> 41:36.076
It happened to me.

41:37.620 --> 41:40.539
It's the person I want to become.

41:40.623 --> 41:43.459
One that proves that dreams do come true

41:44.293 --> 41:46.212
if you put will and passion into it.

41:46.295 --> 41:47.796
It's very windy today.

41:47.880 --> 41:50.007
This is the true heart of the boxer,

41:50.090 --> 41:54.428
it is the hope we instill
in those who watch our meetings.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.138
- The heart...
- Ah, it's ready.

41:56.222 --> 41:57.181
Let's eat.

41:59.350 --> 42:00.184
Ecco.

42:05.689 --> 42:07.399
- Are good?
- Yes, excellent.

42:08.609 --> 42:10.819
But what work do you do?

42:10.903 --> 42:15.366
I taught gymnastics
at a friend's kindergarten.

42:15.449 --> 42:16.951
A kind of master.

42:17.034 --> 42:18.536
Well, it doesn't suit you.

42:18.619 --> 42:22.414
How, sorry? Children love me.

42:22.498 --> 42:24.959
In the morning I taught
and in the afternoon I trained.

42:25.042 --> 42:27.920
Since school closed,
I've been in trouble.

42:30.297 --> 42:34.301
Do you want to deliver parcels with me?
Deliveries are going swimmingly.

42:35.177 --> 42:36.637
- Do they pay well?
- Yes.

42:36.720 --> 42:38.305
If we commit ourselves,

42:38.389 --> 42:40.766
we also earn 200,000 won a day.

42:40.849 --> 42:41.725
Truly?

42:41.809 --> 42:43.727
With deliveries you do cardio,

42:43.811 --> 42:47.147
you use muscles that you don't use with boxing
and your balance improves.

42:47.231 --> 42:49.441
Two birds with one stone, man.

42:49.525 --> 42:51.569
- Three pigeons.
- Meaning what?

42:51.652 --> 42:54.572
You make gains, you do cardio
and you improve your balance.

42:54.655 --> 42:57.157
Cardio and balance count for one.

42:57.241 --> 42:58.993
No, they are two different things.

42:59.076 --> 43:00.077
Ugh.

43:00.995 --> 43:03.622
You didn't represent
Korea at the Super Series,

43:03.706 --> 43:06.709
since you won
the rookie tournament?

43:06.792 --> 43:10.254
Yes, but it was postponed due to COVID.

43:12.214 --> 43:14.592
Cabbage. But how much longer will it take?

43:15.301 --> 43:16.844
I can not do anything about it.

43:19.388 --> 43:23.142
But I'm always ready to fight.

43:26.186 --> 43:27.021
Sai,

43:27.896 --> 43:29.857
you have the heart of a boxer.

43:37.364 --> 43:38.407
Dai.

43:38.490 --> 43:40.367
- Come here, Pacquiao.
- Now?

43:41.577 --> 43:42.411
Forza!

43:49.251 --> 43:50.711
Why did you hit me?

43:50.794 --> 43:51.962
I'm sorry.

43:52.046 --> 43:54.715
Come on, come here. Stop that.

43:54.798 --> 43:57.885
Come here, Kim Gun-woo!

43:57.968 --> 44:00.054
Hey, Kim Gun-woo! Come here!

44:01.639 --> 44:04.224
Let's have a nice toast!

44:04.933 --> 44:07.603
- Hello!
- Cine Cine!

44:07.686 --> 44:10.939
And now the highlight!
The most spectacular performance!

44:11.023 --> 44:14.276
In-beom smashes the watermelon!

44:15.527 --> 44:17.112
Come on, how much do you bet?

44:17.196 --> 44:19.073
A million who can't make it!

44:20.115 --> 44:23.243
I bet you three million that he can do it!

44:24.078 --> 44:27.206
If I win the pot,
I'll offer you everything!

44:28.332 --> 44:29.249
Beom.

44:29.333 --> 44:32.336
I know you can crack it,
but I'll bet four million on no.

44:33.837 --> 44:36.340
- Mr. In-beom!
- Go ahead!

44:36.423 --> 44:39.134
- Mr. In-beom!
- Mr. In-beom!

44:39.218 --> 44:41.178
- Go ahead!
- Mr. In-beom!

44:43.097 --> 44:43.972
He rocked it!

44:46.016 --> 44:47.768
Buy your snacks!

44:47.851 --> 44:49.645
Let's buy some food!

44:49.728 --> 44:50.813
Fantastic!

44:51.897 --> 44:53.315
It worked out well for me, didn't it?

44:56.902 --> 44:58.570
Silence!

45:05.035 --> 45:06.120
Yes, mayor.

45:08.580 --> 45:09.415
Yes.

45:12.626 --> 45:13.627
Yes.

45:17.673 --> 45:18.674
Yes, mayor.

45:20.175 --> 45:21.385
Yes, I see.

45:21.468 --> 45:22.761
I tell him.

45:23.887 --> 45:25.222
Good evening to you.

45:29.101 --> 45:31.770
The mayor will support

45:33.021 --> 45:34.690
his casino project.

45:43.240 --> 45:46.618
I have prepared a small gift

45:46.702 --> 45:49.288
on your birthday, Mr. Park.

45:54.543 --> 45:55.377
Open it.

46:01.967 --> 46:03.594
That's 3.7kg of gold.

46:04.678 --> 46:05.512
Say. Park,

46:06.013 --> 46:09.767
turtles are clean,
no one will understand where they come from.

46:10.768 --> 46:12.394
I give them to him with hope

46:12.478 --> 46:15.272
that this relationship will be profitable for a long time.

46:15.355 --> 46:18.692
I would be truly grateful
if you decided to accept them.

46:27.493 --> 46:29.870
It will not always remain with the Municipality.

46:31.371 --> 46:33.415
I know he has big ambitions.

46:33.499 --> 46:35.375
If he wants to get to the Blue House

46:35.459 --> 46:38.170
and the National Assembly,
she will need money.

46:39.254 --> 46:40.881
Let's make an alliance.

46:41.381 --> 46:43.759
He will have my full support, always.

46:45.427 --> 46:48.889
My money has never let me down.

47:07.074 --> 47:08.283
But what are you doing?

47:08.367 --> 47:10.994
Be careful. We'll take her home.

47:11.078 --> 47:11.912
Let's go.

47:18.460 --> 47:20.587
When are you taking care
of Congressman Seo's building?

47:21.088 --> 47:23.298
It depends on the stores, but by Friday.

47:23.382 --> 47:26.093
Between all of them,
they owe about 20 million in interest.

47:26.593 --> 47:28.303
With the right push, they will go away.

47:29.179 --> 47:31.139
People tend to give up

47:31.223 --> 47:36.436
if he sees his shop devastated
when he goes to work.

47:38.272 --> 47:39.606
I will do so, President.

47:40.732 --> 47:43.610
Mr. Jung isn't well,
he's not here tonight.

47:43.694 --> 47:46.446
I tell him to send
about fifteen men.

47:46.530 --> 47:47.990
Beom takes care of finishing.

47:48.073 --> 47:49.533
Do we give them weapons?

47:50.117 --> 47:51.159
They are not needed.

47:51.243 --> 47:54.162
Tell him to put on his suit
and mask.

47:54.246 --> 47:56.415
President, five are enough.

47:56.498 --> 47:59.459
The president will have his reasons.

48:01.461 --> 48:02.713
It is true.

48:03.338 --> 48:04.965
I'm wrong, for sure.

48:07.551 --> 48:09.553
Here we go again with you two assholes.

48:09.636 --> 48:11.430
Come on, let's concentrate. So?

48:12.806 --> 48:14.474
Where do we want to start?

48:53.889 --> 48:54.848
Salve.

48:55.891 --> 48:57.768
He didn't keep his promise.

48:58.810 --> 48:59.645
Come?

48:59.728 --> 49:01.521
He had to pay a commission

49:02.689 --> 49:04.608
in exchange for a lower rate.

49:05.275 --> 49:06.360
What?

49:07.945 --> 49:10.447
He had to pay a fee on the loan

49:10.530 --> 49:12.658
which is 10% of the sum

49:13.241 --> 49:16.787
within 24 hours of signing the contract.
It's in the contract.

49:16.870 --> 49:18.789
She couldn't do something that easy

49:19.790 --> 49:22.501
and the interest on the commission
amounts to 40 million.

49:22.584 --> 49:26.380
And then his credit rating got worse
and the rate is now 20%.

49:27.547 --> 49:28.382
Sit down,

49:29.341 --> 49:32.135
we set out with the best intentions.

49:33.345 --> 49:35.263
But she ruined everything!

49:37.683 --> 49:39.017
What will he do now?

49:39.601 --> 49:41.520
Is there any interest money?

49:45.232 --> 49:46.650
I'll call the police.

49:47.567 --> 49:48.402
Police?

49:50.153 --> 49:51.154
Yes.

50:02.791 --> 50:03.709
Hate.

50:11.133 --> 50:12.009
<i>Ciao, mamma.</i>

50:12.092 --> 50:13.885
Hello where are you?

50:13.969 --> 50:15.303
I'm almost there.

50:15.387 --> 50:17.389
<i>Okay, I'm at the bar.</i>

50:17.472 --> 50:19.558
<i>There are some strange people here...</i>

50:19.641 --> 50:21.435
Strange people? Who I am?

50:21.518 --> 50:22.602
I am...

50:24.730 --> 50:26.189
Mamma?

50:42.998 --> 50:44.124
Smash everything!

50:59.222 --> 51:01.183
Where do you think you're going, idiot?

51:01.266 --> 51:04.019
Where are you going? Get out of my way, you idiot!

51:05.103 --> 51:07.272
Go away, I told you!

51:09.691 --> 51:11.359
Do not try...

51:13.153 --> 51:15.322
- What happens? Take it.
- Idiot.

51:15.405 --> 51:18.784
- And who would this asshole be?
- Hey you, asshole!

51:26.083 --> 51:27.501
Stop him, come on!

51:28.335 --> 51:29.586
Asshole!

51:29.669 --> 51:31.379
- Damn!
- Fuck!

51:32.422 --> 51:33.840
- Hey, over here.
- Shit!

51:45.477 --> 51:46.478
Cursed!

51:53.568 --> 51:54.694
Asshole!

52:10.752 --> 52:11.711
Asshole!

52:25.142 --> 52:26.601
Mom, are you okay?

52:26.685 --> 52:27.519
Yes.

52:27.602 --> 52:28.728
Did you get hurt?

52:28.812 --> 52:30.689
I am fine.

52:41.449 --> 52:42.367
Who are you?

52:43.827 --> 52:46.037
Why did you do this at the bar?

52:47.789 --> 52:49.124
I asked you who you are.

53:09.144 --> 53:10.437
Calm down, kid.

53:11.396 --> 53:14.691
Your mother borrowed money
from us.

53:19.237 --> 53:20.405
What do you want?

53:21.615 --> 53:22.908
May he give them back to us.

53:23.491 --> 53:25.327
Pay the damage to the bar first.

53:47.098 --> 53:48.183
Beom.

53:59.486 --> 54:01.863
Everything is fine. Stay here for a moment.

54:01.947 --> 54:02.948
Gun-woo.

55:20.692 --> 55:21.609
Gun-woo!

55:50.013 --> 55:51.848
Gun-woo, no!

56:10.241 --> 56:11.076
Beom.

56:35.016 --> 56:35.850
Sai,

56:37.435 --> 56:38.978
I like those who have determination.

56:40.855 --> 56:44.442
- Those who have determination can do everything.
- Cursed.

56:47.695 --> 56:49.280
Do you want to work for me?

56:49.364 --> 56:50.490
Of...

59:25.770 --> 59:28.731
