00:17.726 --> 00:19.519
HONG MIN-BEOM

00:19.602 --> 00:20.770
Gang-yong?

00:20.854 --> 00:22.522
<i>Yes. I'll be there in ten minutes.</i>

00:22.605 --> 00:25.066
Min-beom, don't hang up.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.193
Stavi mobile na stol

00:27.277 --> 00:29.654
<i>to be able to listen. Do you understand?</i>

00:39.456 --> 00:40.749
Let's cut to the chase.

00:43.001 --> 00:43.918
What are you doing?

00:49.674 --> 00:51.926
Don't act like a child and be calm.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.178
GANG-YONG

00:53.261 --> 00:54.095
Do you hear me?

00:54.179 --> 00:56.431
Bastard, how are you talking to me?

00:56.514 --> 00:57.932
<i>Do you want to die?</i>

00:59.434 --> 01:02.729
You're making a big mistake, you fucking criminal!

01:02.812 --> 01:03.730
Shut up.

01:05.398 --> 01:06.232
Gang-yong.

01:07.192 --> 01:09.819
- Quiet!
- I'll make sure you end up in jail!

01:09.903 --> 01:10.779
<i>Kurvin sine!</i>

01:12.405 --> 01:14.949
Fuck! Shut up, dumbass!

01:18.286 --> 01:19.120
A fool.

01:21.372 --> 01:22.832
Have you calmed down now?

01:25.627 --> 01:26.669
Answer me.

01:27.879 --> 01:29.005
What do you want?

01:29.589 --> 01:32.634
A report was received at the police station today
.

01:33.134 --> 01:37.347
A guy on a motorcycle slit
a man's throat in the parking lot and ran away.

01:38.014 --> 01:39.057
Write this down.

01:39.724 --> 01:44.479
Alone, Gangdong, A 6438.

01:45.146 --> 01:47.816
It's a fake table number
, so it won't be in the database.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.527
Find out where the guy on the motorcycle is.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.613
To find out...

01:53.696 --> 01:55.365
<i>I know it won't be easy.</i>

01:55.990 --> 01:57.242
That's why I called you.

01:58.201 --> 02:00.036
<i>It is now 10 pm. I give you five hours.</i>

02:00.537 --> 02:01.830
If you don't find it,

02:03.456 --> 02:06.251
your cousin's striptease
will end up on the internet.

02:06.334 --> 02:09.045
Try to row me over
and the same thing will happen.

02:09.712 --> 02:13.258
<i>If you don't want Group Iil share prices
to fall tomorrow morning,</i>

02:13.341 --> 02:14.175
listen to me

02:18.596 --> 02:19.430
What is the code?

02:20.181 --> 02:21.516
735629.

02:29.440 --> 02:30.275
See you.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.114
Fuck!

03:07.020 --> 03:10.190
CHASERS

03:17.155 --> 03:18.114
Good evening.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.074
- Come, poor thing.
- Hello!

03:20.158 --> 03:21.034
Damn it.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.119
I'll buy you a drink.

03:30.585 --> 03:32.212
- This way.
- Thank you.

03:32.712 --> 03:33.922
- Sir.
- Hello.

03:35.506 --> 03:40.011
They cook the body for days
until the bones are soft.

03:40.094 --> 03:42.430
Then they grind them up and throw them into the ocean.

03:42.513 --> 03:44.557
It costs 15 million per body.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.309
We won't find a single bone.

03:46.976 --> 03:49.145
Who cooks people? What patients.

03:49.771 --> 03:50.730
How do you know that?

03:51.606 --> 03:52.982
Seung-deok told me.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.193
He is in prison. How does he know about it?

03:55.276 --> 03:57.862
Prison is always
the fastest source of information.

03:59.113 --> 04:00.823
Guys, are you okay?

04:01.616 --> 04:02.992
- We're.
- We're.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.536
It was not easy to witness that.

04:07.747 --> 04:11.626
What will happen when the casino opens?

04:11.709 --> 04:12.669
What do you mean?

04:13.836 --> 04:15.588
Myeong-gil will collect the money.

04:15.672 --> 04:17.006
- I understand.
- Gun-woo.

04:17.507 --> 04:18.341
And?

04:18.424 --> 04:22.428
Gamblers and drug addicts
often take out private loans.

04:22.512 --> 04:25.473
Myeong-gil wants to connect
gambling and money lending.

04:26.099 --> 04:30.478
The more people visit his casino,
the more people will take out loans.

04:30.561 --> 04:32.981
Money will come in every day.

04:33.898 --> 04:35.984
But only foreigners can go to casinos.

04:37.610 --> 04:38.820
That is not an obstacle for him.

04:38.903 --> 04:39.779
Aha.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.573
Big clients will be let in the back.

04:42.657 --> 04:44.284
They won't make much money legally.

04:45.451 --> 04:49.289
When he earns enough money,
he will take out a loan and buy a building.

04:49.372 --> 04:51.040
She will be his collateral

04:51.124 --> 04:53.668
for a bigger loan and the purchase of an even bigger building.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.713
That bastard is very resourceful.

04:56.796 --> 05:00.258
He will increase activities in the casino
to pay back the loan.

05:00.341 --> 05:03.177
And Smile Capital
will squeeze even more people.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.763
Myeong-gil will gain control over everyone.

05:18.192 --> 05:23.781
Myeong-gil stole
more than 20 billion won from me back then.

05:23.865 --> 05:26.284
When we return them,

05:26.367 --> 05:29.829
shall we travel the world
with Gun-woo and Woo-jin?

05:30.955 --> 05:33.082
And now we have enough money.

05:35.084 --> 05:35.918
And,

05:36.919 --> 05:38.880
but we can't go anywhere because of corona.

05:40.798 --> 05:41.632
Pa...

05:43.634 --> 05:44.635
We're going to Rome.

05:47.555 --> 05:48.556
Why there?

05:48.639 --> 05:52.060
When I was 20 years old,
I saw the movie <i>Holiday in Rome</i>.

05:53.019 --> 05:56.397
I swore I'd go there
after I got rich,

05:56.481 --> 05:57.857
but I didn't have a chance.

05:57.940 --> 06:01.611
I thought it would be nice if we went,

06:02.195 --> 06:03.863
four of us.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.827
I'll buy you anything you want.

06:10.912 --> 06:14.040
Grandpa, there are many expensive things in Italy.

06:14.123 --> 06:15.541
It is a land of luxury.

06:16.125 --> 06:18.711
Who do you think you're talking to?

06:19.796 --> 06:21.672
You will see how the money is spent.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.803
Grandpa, it's called "flexing".

06:27.970 --> 06:31.474
Yes, I will show you "flexing".

06:32.850 --> 06:36.020
You show nothing. You're just flexing.

06:38.064 --> 06:38.940
Flexible

06:44.404 --> 06:48.282
Well, when all this is over,
we'll all travel there together.

07:04.757 --> 07:05.591
Yes sir?

07:06.884 --> 07:08.219
Yeah, that sounds good.

07:09.345 --> 07:10.179
Yes sir.

07:11.180 --> 07:14.392
Mr. Choi invited us for a drink at his place.

07:16.519 --> 07:18.146
I guess he's in a good mood.

07:19.564 --> 07:20.898
Do you two drink?

07:21.941 --> 07:22.775
We're coming!

08:18.164 --> 08:19.457
Can you speed up?

08:19.957 --> 08:21.834
Double or quadruple?

08:21.918 --> 08:23.252
- Double.
- Good.

08:30.092 --> 08:32.053
If I were Kim Myeong-gil,

08:32.136 --> 08:35.681
I would move the hard drive
to a more secure location

08:35.765 --> 08:38.434
fearing that Im Jang-do had blurted it all out.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.771
Do you think you could pull it off?

08:41.854 --> 08:44.899
We took away his main helpers.

08:44.982 --> 08:48.528
Now there is no one to mobilize but Jung.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.196
In addition,

08:51.155 --> 08:54.075
I don't think he would trust
that information to anyone.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.286
He doesn't have to move it far.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.413
He can put it in the trunk.

09:00.164 --> 09:01.541
He is aware of that.

09:02.291 --> 09:03.125
You're right.

09:03.918 --> 09:07.255
If we could win
his enemies to our side,

09:07.338 --> 09:09.215
that would be to our advantage.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.970
But for that we need a hard drive.

09:14.053 --> 09:17.473
The disk contains a lot of information
about his victims of blackmail.

09:18.140 --> 09:20.643
These people have the same motive as us.

09:22.019 --> 09:26.399
There must be many powerful individuals
like Group Iil's successor.

09:29.110 --> 09:31.821
The longer this goes on,
the worse off we are.

09:32.488 --> 09:35.741
Myeong-gil has already established
a wide network of acquaintances.

09:36.367 --> 09:39.996
He must have already bribed
all the policemen, prosecutors and politicians

09:40.746 --> 09:42.039
which he could.

09:42.707 --> 09:45.668
If we relax even for a moment,
it will harm us.

09:46.627 --> 09:47.545
And.

09:47.628 --> 09:51.173
Still, we took three men from him, didn't we?

09:51.841 --> 09:52.675
And.

09:53.718 --> 09:56.262
It discourages planning too far in advance.

09:56.887 --> 09:59.599
But as far as it seems to me,
we started well.

09:59.682 --> 10:01.225
No one was injured.

10:01.892 --> 10:02.727
Truth.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.271
We do things one at a time.

10:05.354 --> 10:08.274
Let's take down Myeong-gil first,
then his company.

10:09.025 --> 10:12.194
Besides, now that
Im Jang-do and Kim Jun-min are gone,

10:12.278 --> 10:14.530
he will surely come to his senses.

10:17.158 --> 10:18.951
I guess you're right.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.163
This one...

10:25.041 --> 10:26.792
And.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.502
Mr. Choi. Ladies and gentlemen.

10:30.921 --> 10:36.135
I would like to toast
our safety and our common goal.

10:36.802 --> 10:40.014
When I say "Let's find that disk,"

10:40.097 --> 10:42.266
you say, "Kim Myeong-gil is done"

10:43.184 --> 10:45.186
as a continuation of the toast.

10:45.269 --> 10:47.355
Let's begin. Raise your glasses.

10:49.398 --> 10:51.692
Let's find that disc. Kim Myeong-gil is...

10:51.776 --> 10:53.694
- Gotov!
- Gotov!

11:44.787 --> 11:46.455
<i>I'm going to Joongang station.</i>

11:46.539 --> 11:49.083
<i>They moved from Dongpa-gu district
to Joongang-gu.</i>

11:50.084 --> 11:51.836
Can you find them by 3 o'clock?

11:52.837 --> 11:54.797
They can if they stopped in Joongang-gu,

11:54.880 --> 11:57.007
but if they moved to another district,

11:57.091 --> 11:58.551
I'll have to keep looking.

12:00.344 --> 12:01.178
Help me.

12:01.679 --> 12:03.097
<i>Don't worry.</i>

12:03.180 --> 12:05.725
For now, we'll do what the bastard wants.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.979
And when this is over,
I'll figure out how to screw him up.

12:10.855 --> 12:11.731
Thank you.

12:12.273 --> 12:16.318
Min-beom, you think I'd let
some jerk screw my family?

12:17.570 --> 12:18.404
Do not worry.

12:18.487 --> 12:19.572
<i>Dobro?</i>

12:19.655 --> 12:21.073
I only have you.

12:21.699 --> 12:24.243
<i>Don't drink too much, okay?</i>

12:24.910 --> 12:25.786
And.

12:46.515 --> 12:49.226
God. Why did he drink so much
if he can't stand drinking?

12:49.310 --> 12:50.352
Maybe he was

12:51.312 --> 12:52.772
especially good will.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.815
I am sleepy. And you?

12:54.899 --> 12:56.400
I'm going back down.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.235
- Aren't you tired?
- No, I'm fine.

13:01.864 --> 13:02.782
Well done for today.

13:02.865 --> 13:03.783
Of course.

13:10.372 --> 13:11.540
Gun-woo.

13:12.416 --> 13:13.250
Gun-woo.

13:15.419 --> 13:16.253
You do not sleep?

13:17.546 --> 13:18.923
Not. Why are you awake?

13:19.006 --> 13:21.008
We relax with a drink.

13:21.675 --> 13:23.928
- Do you drink too?
- Of course not.

13:24.011 --> 13:24.887
God.

13:26.722 --> 13:28.933
In the morning I will make a hangover soup.

13:29.016 --> 13:30.935
It can. Sleep. I'll close the door.

13:31.018 --> 13:32.561
Good. Sleep tight.

13:32.645 --> 13:33.771
Good night.

13:36.106 --> 13:39.068
Nice to have a drink
with you after so long.

13:58.337 --> 13:59.171
Some woman?

13:59.755 --> 14:00.589
And.

14:01.131 --> 14:02.925
Who would call you at this time?

14:07.221 --> 14:08.556
Tell me.

14:10.766 --> 14:11.600
Yang-jung.

14:14.478 --> 14:15.479
I'm going to be a dad.

14:17.523 --> 14:18.524
What?

14:19.108 --> 14:20.985
In two months. It's a girl.

14:23.612 --> 14:25.698
I have been with her mother for three years.

14:26.824 --> 14:30.077
You should have told me
you had a family, you wretch!

14:30.160 --> 14:32.746
Then he would tell me not to come.

14:36.792 --> 14:38.586
Go home. I'll be leaving soon too.

14:38.669 --> 14:40.963
No, we haven't been drinking together for a long time.

14:41.046 --> 14:42.131
I'm staying.

14:42.214 --> 14:43.632
I said you were going home.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.093
Man, that temper of yours.

14:49.054 --> 14:49.889
Hello.

14:50.973 --> 14:52.266
Thanks, I don't need it.

14:52.766 --> 14:55.352
It's not for you. Buy the woman some meat.

14:55.436 --> 14:57.980
Iron intake is important for pregnant women. Come on.

15:00.399 --> 15:01.775
This is too much.

15:05.195 --> 15:06.113
Are you coming?

15:06.196 --> 15:07.364
Yes, I will now.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.158
- Good. I'll be down.
- Alright.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.037
Call a taxi.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.414
I'll light another one while you wait.

15:17.374 --> 15:18.208
Yang-jung.

15:21.795 --> 15:22.630
Thank you.

15:24.048 --> 15:25.507
You are talking nonsense.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.638
You are the best.

15:31.138 --> 15:33.390
I will buy <i>hanwoo</i> beef on the way back.

15:38.729 --> 15:40.731
Hyeon-ju said she was going to bed.

15:40.814 --> 15:41.649
Good.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.653
Are you OK?

15:45.736 --> 15:46.570
Yes I am.

15:53.827 --> 15:55.496
You must be very worried.

15:56.163 --> 15:59.291
I taught Myeong-gil.
He is my responsibility.

16:00.250 --> 16:02.169
But after my body betrayed me,

16:02.920 --> 16:04.254
I didn't have the courage

16:05.839 --> 16:07.091
fight with him.

16:09.385 --> 16:10.803
The only thing I could do

16:11.887 --> 16:14.848
it was to take care of Hyeon.

17:25.669 --> 17:26.795
Who are you?

17:27.713 --> 17:28.547
Pa,

17:29.673 --> 17:30.549
I'm a friend

17:32.259 --> 17:33.218
your dad's.

17:38.682 --> 17:40.934
Do not Cry.

17:41.435 --> 17:42.394
Please do not.

17:46.982 --> 17:48.484
Tata!

17:53.280 --> 17:56.617
TOUGH

17:57.576 --> 17:58.911
What do you mean?

18:01.288 --> 18:02.831
Fill this hall

18:02.915 --> 18:05.125
the most beautiful flowers for a funeral.

18:05.209 --> 18:06.043
Yes sir.

18:06.126 --> 18:09.546
Bring ten men
to guard the coffin transport.

18:10.255 --> 18:12.049
- Shall we arm them?
- No.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.843
Bring them because the girl is alone.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.178
Let them feed her.

18:16.261 --> 18:17.096
Yes sir.

18:18.639 --> 18:21.391
Sir, I think
you left the scarf inside.

18:21.475 --> 18:22.768
No, it doesn't matter.

18:25.395 --> 18:27.314
By the way, why did he kill himself?

18:28.148 --> 18:30.984
He worked as a delivery boy in the morning,
in the factory during the day,

18:31.068 --> 18:32.778
and at night as a driver.

18:32.861 --> 18:36.448
He slept three hours
working night shifts to save his daughter.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.408
He lived like that for two years.

18:38.492 --> 18:40.744
His daughter recovered. Why would you kill yourself?

18:41.703 --> 18:42.788
I don't see the reason.

18:43.705 --> 18:45.916
I loaned him money without interest.

18:45.999 --> 18:47.501
He owed only the principal.

18:48.043 --> 18:51.171
I told him that I would
extend his repayment indefinitely.

18:59.429 --> 19:00.347
I'll look into it.

19:00.931 --> 19:02.141
I do not understand.

19:10.524 --> 19:11.400
There.

19:15.946 --> 19:16.864
Third floor.

19:26.415 --> 19:27.457
Sorry.

19:29.042 --> 19:29.960
You scared me.

19:30.544 --> 19:33.505
Are you going to Mr. Cha Sang-ho's funeral?

19:35.174 --> 19:36.008
Idem.

19:39.678 --> 19:43.515
Two years ago I had back surgery
and could not lift things.

19:44.057 --> 19:48.353
Hyeon-jun's father
took out the trash for me for three months.

19:49.855 --> 19:50.981
God.

19:51.732 --> 19:54.610
He was extremely kind and hardworking.

19:55.944 --> 19:58.113
I felt very sorry for Hyeon.

19:58.197 --> 20:01.450
That poor thing was sick and motherless.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.828
I fed her and filled their refrigerator

20:05.370 --> 20:07.206
so that they don't run out of food.

20:07.289 --> 20:11.168
Why would such a man kill himself
now that Hyeon-ju has recovered?

20:11.251 --> 20:14.421
It's because of those damn moneylenders!

20:15.839 --> 20:17.966
They came whenever they wanted,

20:18.050 --> 20:20.093
they grabbed him by the neck and beat him.

20:20.177 --> 20:22.137
Oh God.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.096
Describe them.

20:24.848 --> 20:27.893
One was built like a bear,

20:28.393 --> 20:31.104
and the other was very tall.

20:34.107 --> 20:35.359
<i>A month later</i>

20:35.984 --> 20:39.446
another person
to whom I lent money killed himself.

20:40.113 --> 20:44.701
I also gave her an interest-free loan
because she had a sick family member.

20:46.161 --> 20:47.496
I'm going home too early.

20:50.165 --> 20:50.999
Watch out for the stairs.

20:55.545 --> 20:56.546
God, my brother.

21:03.220 --> 21:04.054
I'm going now.

21:05.722 --> 21:07.224
- Have a safe trip home.
- Thank you.

21:09.059 --> 21:10.060
Good night.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.277
<i>Yang-jung later found out</i>

21:18.777 --> 21:23.615
that Myeong-gil was visiting the people
I gave loans to

21:25.367 --> 21:27.411
for the treatment of their family.

21:27.494 --> 21:29.496
He billed them every month

21:29.579 --> 21:31.915
several million to extend the loan

21:33.208 --> 21:35.711
telling them that I ordered it.

21:37.004 --> 21:40.215
My mom fell for the same trick.

21:41.967 --> 21:44.094
There was a hidden clause in the contract.

21:47.139 --> 21:48.098
I understand.

21:49.891 --> 21:51.143
I'm sorry.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.228
Nothing.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.856
Many have died because of me.

21:56.648 --> 21:57.482
It's not true.

21:58.734 --> 22:01.320
You have nothing to be sorry for, Mr. Choi.

22:01.945 --> 22:04.197
You have a strong sense of responsibility

22:04.281 --> 22:07.284
and that's why you feel so guilty.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.912
Those who have no shame
feel no guilt.

22:11.413 --> 22:15.334
They always blame others
and take advantage of those weaker than themselves.

22:17.252 --> 22:22.215
I believe we are all gathered here
because of your good deeds.

22:22.799 --> 22:28.013
I don't think Hyeon-ju knows
that you bought the orphanage for her,

22:28.597 --> 22:30.932
but he trusts you with all his heart.

22:32.017 --> 22:35.103
We will stop Kim Myeong-gil
at all costs.

22:35.854 --> 22:37.397
So stop blaming yourself

22:39.316 --> 22:41.276
and take care of your health.

22:55.165 --> 22:59.836
When this is all over,
I'll get you your own gym

22:59.920 --> 23:04.049
where you can focus
on training until you become a champion.

23:04.841 --> 23:08.720
I'm going to build a nice big cafe for your mom on the first floor .

23:09.971 --> 23:12.057
They won't pay the rent as long as I live.

23:13.308 --> 23:14.726
Pa...

23:17.813 --> 23:20.273
Don't know what to say?

23:20.357 --> 23:21.191
Yes.

23:23.360 --> 23:24.736
Maybe "thank you".

23:26.154 --> 23:26.988
And.

23:28.115 --> 23:29.533
Thank you, Mr. Choi.

23:29.616 --> 23:30.534
Yes.

23:32.702 --> 23:34.413
I should thank you.

23:36.331 --> 23:38.458
You teach me what youth is.

23:40.961 --> 23:41.837
This is...

23:43.964 --> 23:44.798
flexing!

23:46.466 --> 23:47.467
You like it?

23:47.551 --> 23:48.718
And.

23:53.765 --> 23:54.599
See here.

23:54.683 --> 23:56.518
- Here?
- No, next to it.

23:56.601 --> 23:57.436
Good.

24:14.119 --> 24:15.078
And that part?

24:15.745 --> 24:16.872
Good.

24:31.094 --> 24:32.304
- Thank you.
- Nothing.

24:32.387 --> 24:33.221
Bravo.

24:47.319 --> 24:48.487
GANG-YONG

24:50.572 --> 24:52.824
- Fall?
- Onyu-ro 88.

24:53.909 --> 24:54.784
Happy?

24:55.869 --> 24:56.870
Thanks for the effort.

25:08.298 --> 25:10.008
- Let's go.
- Yes sir!

26:24.457 --> 26:25.417
Stop.

26:29.963 --> 26:31.965
Looks like Choi is on crutches now.

26:46.730 --> 26:48.231
They tortured Jang-do with salt.

26:50.609 --> 26:51.776
Did he snitch on us?

26:52.444 --> 26:53.737
I'm not sure.

26:56.615 --> 26:59.284
In this case,
we can assume that it is.

27:00.493 --> 27:02.203
We'll get rid of Choi first,

27:04.289 --> 27:05.332
a onda Jang-doa.

27:06.499 --> 27:07.542
Yes sir.

27:12.631 --> 27:13.465
Sir.

27:18.887 --> 27:21.056
LEE DU-YONG

27:29.606 --> 27:31.900
Be careful not to accidentally kill him.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.027
I have to ask him something.

27:34.110 --> 27:34.944
Yes sir.

27:35.612 --> 27:36.988
And get it out of your ears.

27:37.072 --> 27:37.947
Good.

28:07.811 --> 28:08.645
Du-yeong.

28:10.021 --> 28:11.815
I think there's someone at the door.

28:28.081 --> 28:29.332
Who is?

28:29.416 --> 28:31.459
Neighbor from the lower floor.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.128
Water is leaking from the ceiling.

28:33.962 --> 28:36.172
Can I look in your bathroom?

28:40.260 --> 28:43.304
I promise it won't take long.
My apartment is flooded.

28:44.806 --> 28:46.433
My children can't sleep.

28:48.977 --> 28:50.228
I would be grateful.

28:53.398 --> 28:54.482
Now?

28:54.566 --> 28:56.192
That. It won't last long.

28:56.985 --> 28:58.403
Just to see the situation.

29:12.125 --> 29:12.959
Honey?

29:13.752 --> 29:14.586
And?

29:17.172 --> 29:19.841
- Who is?
- He says his water is leaking.

29:23.428 --> 29:24.512
- Move.
- What?

29:24.596 --> 29:25.430
Move over.

29:39.194 --> 29:40.361
- Just a moment.
- Good.

29:55.418 --> 29:59.047
Honey, call the police
and report a burglary in progress.

29:59.839 --> 30:00.840
Why?

30:00.924 --> 30:02.300
I'll explain later.

30:03.176 --> 30:04.010
Do you believe me?

30:05.220 --> 30:06.679
- Yes.
- Another thing.

30:07.931 --> 30:09.140
Whatever happens,

30:10.600 --> 30:12.268
don't open the door.

30:12.852 --> 30:13.686
Good.

30:15.563 --> 30:16.523
Good.

30:16.606 --> 30:18.775
It's okay, honey.

30:18.858 --> 30:20.485
Nothing will happen.

30:25.406 --> 30:26.908
Jesus.

30:51.307 --> 30:52.392
Okrug Dongjak-gu.

31:06.698 --> 31:10.159
Please hurry.
My husband is in danger.

31:21.129 --> 31:23.047
Quick, get in.

31:23.131 --> 31:24.048
Let's get him out.

31:27.218 --> 31:28.303
What the fuck?

31:29.512 --> 31:30.805
Fuck!

31:32.348 --> 31:35.101
Shit. Nasty!

31:36.978 --> 31:38.146
Gade!

31:56.706 --> 31:59.000
Smudge! Kurvin sine!

32:01.878 --> 32:03.087
Get up, asshole!

32:06.174 --> 32:07.342
Curve sine!

33:21.708 --> 33:23.918
If you tell me where Hwang Yang-jung is,

33:25.169 --> 33:26.671
I won't kill your wife.

33:31.384 --> 33:32.802
I always keep my promise.

33:34.137 --> 33:35.138
Regardless of everything.

33:41.686 --> 33:42.520
Trust me.

34:13.301 --> 34:14.927
- Did you get enough sleep?
- Yes I am.

34:16.679 --> 34:17.722
Did you get enough sleep?

34:17.805 --> 34:18.890
- And you?
- Yes I am.

34:22.060 --> 34:22.894
Come.

34:26.564 --> 34:28.274
I can't believe this is happening.

34:28.983 --> 34:30.985
That. This is a real reunion.

34:32.361 --> 34:34.197
Woo-jin, get up. Do you hear me?

34:34.280 --> 34:35.114
Let's eat.

34:38.367 --> 34:40.161
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

34:43.289 --> 34:45.291
- Do not come?
- He doesn't want to get up.

34:45.374 --> 34:47.668
He should have eaten and then gone to sleep again.

34:48.252 --> 34:49.629
He drank a lot yesterday.

34:49.712 --> 34:50.922
Is.

34:51.005 --> 34:53.132
And he boasted that he tolerates drinking well.

34:54.717 --> 34:55.635
Let's eat now.

34:55.718 --> 34:56.928
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

34:57.011 --> 34:58.471
Thanks for the meal.

35:09.482 --> 35:11.067
- Gun-woo.
- Yes?

35:11.150 --> 35:13.903
When are you taking your mother to the orphanage?

35:13.986 --> 35:16.531
Grandpa, I'll borrow your car and take them.

35:16.614 --> 35:20.076
It has been parked for some time.
It might be dangerous. Take care.

35:20.159 --> 35:21.786
- It'll be fine.
- Good.

35:21.869 --> 35:24.956
Shall we go after dinner?
It will only take us an hour.

35:26.624 --> 35:27.542
Does this work for you?

35:27.625 --> 35:29.293
Well, this...

35:29.836 --> 35:34.715
I think I would feel better
if I stayed here and cooked for you.

35:37.802 --> 35:38.636
Gđo Yoon.

35:40.054 --> 35:42.181
I don't want to bother you,

35:43.099 --> 35:45.476
but can you help us in the orphanage?

35:47.395 --> 35:50.106
Your cooking skills are impressive.

35:50.648 --> 35:52.733
Children would love them.

35:54.569 --> 35:57.029
This food is amazing.

36:01.325 --> 36:03.244
Mom, that would be the best.

36:08.249 --> 36:10.459
Fine, if that helps.

36:10.543 --> 36:11.377
Thank you.

36:13.254 --> 36:14.088
You're welcome.

36:26.893 --> 36:30.688
Will you eat all the meals
even if I'm not here?

36:32.106 --> 36:33.191
I will.

36:40.323 --> 36:41.699
Take care.

36:44.035 --> 36:44.869
I will.

36:50.499 --> 36:51.584
Worry less.

36:55.546 --> 36:56.672
I believe in you.

36:56.756 --> 36:57.590
Good.

Hello.

38:43.821 --> 38:44.655
You killed them?

43:20.180 --> 43:22.433
ONLY 25 KM

Let's go.

43:50.461 --> 43:51.378
G. Choi!

43:52.630 --> 43:55.591
- Kim Myeong-gil's men have arrived.
- What are you talking about?

44:04.266 --> 44:06.518
Let's go to the basement. I have a gun there.

44:18.781 --> 44:20.824
I will stay. Go get the gun.

44:21.492 --> 44:22.326
Hey, Woo-jin!

44:22.409 --> 44:23.410
Damn it.

44:23.494 --> 44:25.162
- Woo-jin!
- Get the gun!

44:25.245 --> 44:26.455

This way.

48:20.188 --> 48:21.815
- Pour it out.
- Yes sir.

48:28.989 --> 48:30.240
Blood. Hell.

48:46.798 --> 48:47.633
Bravo.

48:48.133 --> 48:48.967
Thank you.

48:55.724 --> 48:56.850
I owe you...

48:58.894 --> 49:00.354
gratitude.

49:00.437 --> 49:01.939
Here.

49:04.274 --> 49:05.108
you know,

49:06.193 --> 49:07.277
you gave me a dream

49:08.070 --> 49:08.946
Of...

49:15.285 --> 49:16.495
Therefore...

49:19.039 --> 49:20.582
I will make this painless.

49:21.500 --> 49:22.709
It is OK.

49:24.252 --> 49:27.005
It will be over soon. It is OK.

49:27.673 --> 49:29.049
Da, evo.

49:34.054 --> 49:36.098
It is OK.

50:19.933 --> 50:21.184
Gun-woo.

50:36.825 --> 50:38.201
- The back door.
- Good.

50:51.423 --> 50:53.508
Woo-jin!

51:06.063 --> 51:06.897
Woo-jin!

51:35.300 --> 51:36.218
Hyeon-ju!

51:37.761 --> 51:38.970
Hyeon-ju!

51:44.017 --> 51:45.435
Hold on.

51:47.771 --> 51:48.772
Grandpa.

51:51.733 --> 51:52.567
Grandpa.

51:53.068 --> 51:56.446
Grandpa.

51:56.530 --> 51:58.865
God, grandpa.

52:00.200 --> 52:01.243
Grandpa.

52:05.497 --> 52:06.414
Stand up.

52:11.253 --> 52:14.589
Oh God. Gun-woo!

52:15.173 --> 52:16.883
Grandpa!

52:16.967 --> 52:18.426
Gun-woo!

52:19.928 --> 52:22.389
Grandpa, please get up.

52:23.348 --> 52:26.518
Gun-woo, please help.

52:28.854 --> 52:30.939
Grandpa, please...

52:31.022 --> 52:32.691
- Hyeon-ju, we have to go out.
- No!

52:32.774 --> 52:35.277
- We have to. Quickly!
- We can not. Let me go!

52:35.360 --> 52:36.570
You will die here!

52:36.653 --> 52:39.906
Grandpa!

52:43.869 --> 52:44.995
Grandpa!

52:59.885 --> 53:00.719
Scalpel.

53:03.930 --> 53:05.849
Suck the blood! Give me more gauze.

53:12.022 --> 53:13.190
How is the patient?

53:13.273 --> 53:15.317
The pressure is 80/50! The transfusion is starting!

53:15.400 --> 53:18.278
There is a lack of blood due to COVID.
We need it from outside.

53:18.361 --> 53:20.030
Give us as much as you can.

53:20.113 --> 53:21.072
Clamp!

53:28.079 --> 53:29.080
<i>What are we going to do?</i>

53:29.164 --> 53:31.374
- What will we do then?
- If anyone else has...

53:31.458 --> 53:32.792
- Gun-woo!
- What is it?

53:32.876 --> 53:34.502
No blood for Woo-jin.

53:34.586 --> 53:36.171
- What?
- Which group are you?

53:36.254 --> 53:37.756
Group A.

53:37.839 --> 53:38.965
- Come.
- Good.

53:42.677 --> 53:45.180
I will save Woo-jin. Do not worry. Good?

53:45.263 --> 53:46.264
Good.

54:00.320 --> 54:01.488
He's bleeding profusely.

54:01.571 --> 54:04.032
Please prepare a lot of blood.

54:05.116 --> 54:06.076
I need more gauze.

54:06.910 --> 54:07.953
Hurry up.

54:09.996 --> 54:10.997
I'm done.

54:11.081 --> 54:13.458
Is this enough to save Woo-jin?

54:13.541 --> 54:15.627
We'll need a few more bags.

54:15.710 --> 54:16.544
I understand.

54:17.045 --> 54:19.172
Take another one from me.

54:19.256 --> 54:21.466
More than 320 ml will be risky.

54:21.549 --> 54:24.761
I'm fine. I'm a boxer.
I'll be fine.

54:24.844 --> 54:25.762
- I'm fine.
- No.

54:25.845 --> 54:29.516
Please. I really need to save him.

54:30.725 --> 54:32.519
Please get me more blood.

54:32.602 --> 54:34.145
- I'm begging you.
- I can not.

54:34.229 --> 54:35.981
It won't kill me, really.

54:36.815 --> 54:39.985
Please, I have to save Woo-jin.

54:40.068 --> 54:41.444
I have to save him.

54:41.528 --> 54:46.324
I'm begging you! It won't kill me.

54:46.408 --> 54:48.702
- I can't see because of the blood. Suck it up!
- Here.

54:49.452 --> 54:52.414
I can't control the bleeding.
Give me a bandage.

54:52.497 --> 54:54.249
The bandage is ready.

54:54.332 --> 54:56.751
Good. Prepare more, I'll need them.

54:56.835 --> 54:59.337
Blood pressure drops! Please hurry!
