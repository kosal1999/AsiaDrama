00:18.727 --> 00:21.146
President

00:59.476 --> 01:02.854
"Catch outside the ring"

01:02.937 --> 01:05.857
Damn. unbelievable

01:20.163 --> 01:21.081
Mr. Bai.

01:21.164 --> 01:23.541
Give me the address of the woman who runs the café.

01:23.625 --> 01:25.126
These two idiots are ready to fight.

01:25.960 --> 01:27.003
You scoundrels.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.131
You bastards!

01:37.764 --> 01:38.598
the curse

01:52.779 --> 01:54.155
Come closer, you idiot!

01:55.657 --> 01:57.450
Screw you, you bastards! ‬

02:08.044 --> 02:09.170
Damn

02:12.006 --> 02:12.924
You bastard

02:20.890 --> 02:23.017
- They attacked him at the same time!
- You scoundrel.

02:42.245 --> 02:43.663
the curse

02:47.417 --> 02:48.585
You fools!

02:49.169 --> 02:50.253
Come closer!

02:53.214 --> 02:54.132
Scoundrel!

03:08.938 --> 03:11.691
damn you

03:14.861 --> 03:15.778
Beat him up!

03:18.072 --> 03:19.365
damn you

03:27.790 --> 03:28.625
You trifle!

03:31.127 --> 03:31.961
You scoundrel!

03:37.926 --> 03:39.344
the curse

03:53.316 --> 03:54.943
- You bastard!
- You scoundrel!

04:18.591 --> 04:19.425
Damn

04:34.565 --> 04:35.525
You idiot...

04:37.652 --> 04:38.987
Come closer!

04:39.070 --> 04:40.113
Screw it!

04:54.711 --> 04:56.129
stand up! Move

05:21.404 --> 05:23.072
- Let's leave, Gun-woo.
- Okay.

05:23.781 --> 05:25.116
- Let's go!
- Okay.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.580
Thanks for coming, Hyun Joo.

05:31.539 --> 05:32.707
I apologize for coming late.

05:33.541 --> 05:35.251
You saved us from a severe beating.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.796
How painful. the curse

05:52.268 --> 05:54.103
Is that you, Gun Woo?

06:05.948 --> 06:07.241
"Gunwoo"?

06:22.799 --> 06:24.008
Shut up.

06:47.865 --> 06:49.450
- Move quickly.
- Yes, sir.

06:56.290 --> 06:57.125
Hey you

07:04.048 --> 07:06.426
Who is this

07:08.428 --> 07:10.263
How annoying.

07:27.405 --> 07:28.406
the curse

07:50.303 --> 07:51.137
Wait.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.277
Damn

08:38.601 --> 08:39.977
Who are you

08:53.824 --> 08:56.035
Shut your mouth, you bastard.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.209
stand up

09:28.276 --> 09:29.944
Oh God, stop!

09:52.717 --> 09:53.843
What a view.

09:57.972 --> 09:58.931
Hey you

09:59.890 --> 10:01.017
who are you

10:01.767 --> 10:02.935
- Sorry, sir.
- Stop.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.813
I asked you a question.

10:17.116 --> 10:18.159
sleep well

10:30.546 --> 10:31.589
What? What is this

10:32.173 --> 10:33.883
When did you get this beating?

10:44.018 --> 10:45.603
Dear mom

10:47.688 --> 10:48.648
Yes, mom.

10:48.731 --> 10:49.732
“Gun-woo.”

10:51.484 --> 10:53.736
My mom? What happened? Why are you crying?

10:55.488 --> 10:56.989
Someone wants to talk to you.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.370
where are you

11:28.104 --> 11:29.313
“Gun-woo.”

11:33.192 --> 11:35.194
What happened to your forehead, mom?

11:36.195 --> 11:37.488
I'm fine

11:38.781 --> 11:40.658
My head hit the ground.

11:44.370 --> 11:45.663
your face

11:49.083 --> 11:52.002
What happened to your face, Woo Jin?

11:52.086 --> 11:54.213
It's just a scratch.

11:55.047 --> 11:57.842
Mr. Choi felt very anxious
while waiting for you.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.301
Let's go down.

11:59.927 --> 12:00.845
Well
Well

12:04.265 --> 12:05.349
I'll come back

12:09.228 --> 12:10.563
Sit down, everyone!

12:18.237 --> 12:20.823
I'm sure you're very tired
so I'll keep it short.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.411
When I received your call,

12:26.287 --> 12:28.456
I was shocked as if the world had ended.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.084
you are my family

12:33.502 --> 12:36.547
I was so afraid of losing you.

12:37.506 --> 12:39.800
I will no longer tolerate you getting hurt.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.969
Let the adults handle the rest.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.097
-I want to help too.
-Gun-woo.

12:45.681 --> 12:49.602
This is not a game that ends with a win or a loss.

12:50.686 --> 12:53.272
This is a war that will not end until someone dies.

12:57.693 --> 12:58.903
Go upstairs.

13:10.331 --> 13:13.459
- I'm sorry.
- Promise me not to get yourself involved again.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.169
Good

13:15.920 --> 13:18.881
They know where Gun Woo lives
, so it's dangerous to go there.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.634
Take Gun Woo's mother to the orphanage tomorrow.

13:21.717 --> 13:23.803
It would be safer for her to stay there.

13:25.638 --> 13:26.472
Good

13:27.807 --> 13:28.849
good night

13:37.942 --> 13:39.902
What do we do now, Yang Jung?

13:42.738 --> 13:43.864
I'll put an end to it.

13:46.158 --> 13:49.119
We should have taken care of this
a long time ago.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.831
Can you bring Myung-gil?

13:51.914 --> 13:54.375
I'll be forming a team with Do Young starting tomorrow.

13:55.376 --> 13:58.504
- I'll target them one by one.
- Let's eat with Do Young.

13:58.587 --> 13:59.922
Mr. Oh.

14:00.422 --> 14:02.800
Investigate Myeong-gil's men, please.

14:02.883 --> 14:03.759
Yes sir.

15:33.557 --> 15:36.185
I see you there since early morning
, Mr. Director.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.771
I had to come for you, Mr. Kim.

15:39.730 --> 15:41.315
I operated on them myself.

15:41.398 --> 15:42.900
Good. I thank you

15:42.983 --> 15:46.862
One of them had the Achilles tendons
in both feet cut with a knife.

15:47.446 --> 15:51.033
The tendons in my other shoulder were torn.

16:04.588 --> 16:05.589
His hair is short

16:06.757 --> 16:08.342
His eyes are narrow.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.220
He was fast moving.

16:11.929 --> 16:14.181
His knife skills are excellent.

16:19.478 --> 16:20.688
Yes, actually...

16:22.106 --> 16:23.941
It looked more like a sashimi knife.

16:27.695 --> 16:28.779
Damn

16:33.617 --> 16:35.828
Ask Beom
to go to the office at one o'clock.

16:35.911 --> 16:37.788
- Let's meet.
- Yes, sir.

16:38.622 --> 16:40.040
What is happening has become interesting.

16:50.217 --> 16:52.177
- Finish this.
- Okay.

16:54.555 --> 16:55.723
my lord

16:55.806 --> 16:56.640
Yes

16:58.767 --> 16:59.810
I will accompany you.

17:01.353 --> 17:02.396
Stay here.

17:03.522 --> 17:04.898
I want to help sir.

17:04.982 --> 17:06.233
“Min Dong.”

17:07.651 --> 17:09.194
I'll take care of it myself.

17:10.070 --> 17:11.822
Live your life

17:12.489 --> 17:15.367
I want to join you sir!

17:15.451 --> 17:16.410
Listen

17:17.119 --> 17:20.372
If the restaurant is destroyed by my return,

17:20.456 --> 17:21.290
So what will you do?

17:22.499 --> 17:24.918
Protect the store. You can help me with this.

17:25.419 --> 17:26.336
But

17:30.007 --> 17:31.091
Guard the store.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.056
“Yang Jung Huang!”

18:19.640 --> 18:20.808
It's been a while.

18:20.891 --> 18:22.559
Why haven't you been contacting me?

18:22.643 --> 18:24.269
I was busy making a living.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.897
Why does your handsome face show
signs of aging?

18:26.980 --> 18:28.774
Earning a halal livelihood is difficult.

18:28.857 --> 18:29.983
is not it

18:30.067 --> 18:31.819
It's very difficult.

18:34.196 --> 18:35.572
- It's been a long time.
- Yes.

18:36.573 --> 18:39.576
I called Soo Cheol and Min Soo
to ask them to investigate.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.787
It's very complicated.

18:42.621 --> 18:45.958
They are not ordinary moneylenders,
there is something fishy about them.

18:47.584 --> 18:48.502
Thanks

18:48.585 --> 18:49.419
Thanks

18:54.174 --> 18:55.843
A friend of mine heard in "Youido"

18:56.426 --> 18:59.847
The Il Group purchased
an unfinished hotel building in Gangnam.

19:00.514 --> 19:03.100
They got their money from a company called Smile Capital.

19:03.183 --> 19:04.560
It's Myung Gil Kim's company.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.353
Okay

19:07.020 --> 19:10.941
But why would a chaebol borrow
money from Myung Gil Kim? I don't understand it.

19:12.025 --> 19:14.236
Most likely, Myung-Gil Kim tricked them.

19:15.612 --> 19:17.447
- Let's investigate.
- Okay.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.869
We will finally avenge our men.

19:23.912 --> 19:24.872
Let's end this issue.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.166
Mr. Choi gave us his approval.

19:30.002 --> 19:30.836
Good

19:31.670 --> 19:36.300
In the past, Chairman Choi had
five appellants working for him.

19:36.383 --> 19:39.928
At that time, President Choi
had loaned money to companies,

19:40.012 --> 19:42.431
He now has 10 billion won or more
in uncollected money.

19:42.514 --> 19:45.142
But places like real estate companies had gangs

19:45.225 --> 19:47.186
To guard her.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.229
And at times like this, these guys come out.

19:49.730 --> 19:53.317
They go out to eliminate an entire gang in a day.

19:53.400 --> 19:57.654
At that time, even the major gangs were
trembling in fear of stabbing Chairman Choi.

19:59.656 --> 20:02.409
After I removed President Choi,

20:03.660 --> 20:05.495
The first thing I did with “Byom”

20:05.996 --> 20:07.414
He is getting rid of his attackers.

20:07.497 --> 20:08.665
Do you know why?

20:09.833 --> 20:10.751
No sir.

20:11.752 --> 20:14.838
Because I was trembling in fear of them too.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.800
Were you alone?

20:18.884 --> 20:23.347
We sent two gangs, one from Sindang-dong
and the other from Yeongdeungpo, and they were united.

20:23.430 --> 20:26.350
It only came about
because they weren't together at the time.

20:26.433 --> 20:28.602
Otherwise, it would be impossible to achieve this.

20:28.685 --> 20:30.520
Wow, how wonderful, sir.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.022
But in the end,

20:33.023 --> 20:35.525
I couldn't get rid of the two most important ones.

20:36.985 --> 20:40.113
Do Young Lee and Yang Jung Hwang.

20:40.697 --> 20:43.742
They are President Choi's right hand.

20:45.244 --> 20:50.207
I met Do Young Lee once
when I was Chairman Choi's servant.

20:50.290 --> 20:51.500
he is handsome

20:53.001 --> 20:55.587
One time,
there was a gang leader who was stuck in a traffic jam.

20:55.671 --> 20:58.090
He smoked a cigarette with the car window open.

20:58.674 --> 21:00.968
When he heard the sound of a motorcycle approaching,
he turned his head.

21:01.051 --> 21:04.930
Then Do Young Lee slit his face like this
with a sashimi knife and walked away.

21:05.013 --> 21:07.474
His mouth grew so large
and began to tremble like this.

21:07.557 --> 21:09.101
Damn, crazy.

21:11.103 --> 21:14.231
-And who is Yang Jung Hwang?
-It is actually said...

21:15.774 --> 21:18.819
He incapacitated 20 gangsters

21:18.902 --> 21:20.821
By tearing the Achilles tendons.

21:20.904 --> 21:23.073
He fights with two knives,

21:23.156 --> 21:25.534
It is rumored that he stabs 100 times a minute.

21:26.034 --> 21:27.327
It's amazing and wondrous.

21:30.622 --> 21:33.542
correct. Did you say those three guys showed up?

21:33.625 --> 21:36.545
Yes sir. A young woman appeared after some time passed.

21:37.045 --> 21:40.215
I think it has something to do with the bookstore
I told you about before.

21:43.427 --> 21:45.637
It makes sense that he would own a bookstore.

21:45.721 --> 21:49.850
Surely that damned senile old man
crawled out of the darkness to save his children.

21:52.269 --> 21:54.104
Do you know how much President Choi owns?

21:55.772 --> 21:59.776
Nearly 50 billion won in cash I think.

22:01.028 --> 22:03.697
This will save us money
for the club.

22:05.032 --> 22:08.744
Surely there is a force in heaven looking after us,
don't you think?

22:11.455 --> 22:14.916
Jang Do and Beom
monitored the place and brought me everything there.

22:20.047 --> 22:22.049
"Loving Orphanage"

22:33.310 --> 22:34.227
Will not you come

22:35.103 --> 22:37.314
I don't want to enter. Hurry up!

22:38.315 --> 22:40.150
Good. We'll be right back.

22:42.319 --> 22:44.529
- From here, children.
- Look at this.

22:44.613 --> 22:45.614
Please come from here.

22:47.949 --> 22:50.202
It is a children's room so it is a bit small.

22:50.285 --> 22:52.996
But it is suitable for residence,
so take your time to inspect it.

22:53.080 --> 22:53.997
Thanks

23:13.934 --> 23:16.686
What do you think about this place, mom?
Look, it's Woo Jin.

23:16.770 --> 23:18.105
Hello ma'am

23:23.985 --> 23:25.987
A friend of mine from middle school

23:26.071 --> 23:29.699
He works for one of Myung-gil Kim's men,
so he was on the scene that day.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.494
What I heard was that the situation
had reached a terrifying level.

23:33.245 --> 23:34.996
They were waiting for him at the gas station.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.998
As soon as the Ile heir entered,

23:37.082 --> 23:39.501
They imprisoned him, beat him, and threatened him.

23:40.710 --> 23:44.423
They must be the only ones in Korea
who would do this to a chaebol.

23:44.506 --> 23:45.465
and what else

23:45.549 --> 23:47.217
They have a video of the man...

23:58.061 --> 24:01.148
This is Jun Min Kim,
Sales Director at Smile Capital.

24:01.231 --> 24:02.858
He has six records of fraud.

24:03.775 --> 24:07.988
Scams related to used cars and
credit cards, and he did not leave any type of them without practicing them.

24:08.071 --> 24:10.991
He apparently served his detention
in the Seoul Nambu detention center.

24:12.075 --> 24:14.953
Jang Do Im was a student at the Police College.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.998
Until he was fired due to sexual harassment.

24:18.081 --> 24:21.460
He has no previous records and is the head of
strategic planning at Smile Capital.

24:22.043 --> 24:23.128
It's unusual.

24:23.837 --> 24:26.965
The presence of a person familiar with how the police work

24:27.048 --> 24:29.509
It will help them avoid police investigations.

24:29.593 --> 24:30.719
Are these two people important?

24:31.219 --> 24:32.137
Yes

24:32.846 --> 24:34.306
What about their address?

24:34.389 --> 24:35.891
I came up with this guy's address.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.101
He lives in Saesong-dong.

24:38.185 --> 24:40.020
We know his car and its plate number.

24:41.188 --> 24:42.522
We must act quickly.

24:43.732 --> 24:45.275
They will realize what is happening soon.

24:45.358 --> 24:46.193
Okay

24:46.860 --> 24:48.987
I'll take care of this guy.

24:50.739 --> 24:53.992
- Tomorrow night?
- But what limit do we have in dealing with them?

24:54.075 --> 24:56.536
what do you mean? We must eliminate them once and for all.

24:59.706 --> 25:01.082
I'll take care of Myung Gil Kim.

25:01.666 --> 25:03.001
He does not move alone.

25:03.919 --> 25:06.838
What he appears to be different from what he is.
Go with Do Young.

25:08.757 --> 25:10.091
I'll just track him down.

25:12.052 --> 25:14.888
Wasn't there a burly person with Myung-gil?

25:14.971 --> 25:16.014
Okay

25:16.848 --> 25:19.601
The detective agency asked for more time.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.812
I will investigate further.

25:23.522 --> 25:24.940
who is he

25:25.023 --> 25:28.109
He's the man who threw me out the window
and he's strong as a bull.

25:31.863 --> 25:35.116
Sir, what are you going to do with the money
in the bookstore?

25:35.700 --> 25:36.952
We must move it.

25:37.035 --> 25:38.787
He knows the place.

25:39.287 --> 25:41.748
Why don't we ask young people to move money?

25:44.501 --> 25:48.505
The problem is that we do not have time
and we lack manpower.

25:50.423 --> 25:52.259
They are strong.

25:52.342 --> 25:55.136
- They got rid of 30 men.
- Did you see what happened?

25:55.220 --> 25:57.305
I went there but they were lying on the ground.

25:57.806 --> 26:00.850
The three of them were surrounded by 30 men
and without knives...

26:00.934 --> 26:02.686
They are not ordinary guys.

26:03.311 --> 26:06.940
They won't have a problem if they move the money
early in the morning, sir.

26:07.023 --> 26:08.567
Why not give them a chance?

26:09.150 --> 26:10.652
Hyun Joo is smart too.

26:17.659 --> 26:19.202
Okay, let's put it here.

26:20.912 --> 26:21.746
Please.

26:24.958 --> 26:25.834
It looks delicious.

26:28.712 --> 26:30.005
thank you
thank you

26:30.088 --> 26:31.590
- Thank you.
- Pardon, hurry up and eat.

26:32.340 --> 26:34.009
You first, Hyun Joo.

26:34.926 --> 26:36.511
Fine, thank you

26:44.769 --> 26:46.688
Did you use kimchi to prepare it?

26:46.771 --> 26:47.772
Yes

26:48.815 --> 26:51.693
It tastes completely different from the one I was making.

26:53.028 --> 26:54.696
The method is easy. I will teach it to you.

26:56.531 --> 26:57.365
Good

27:02.621 --> 27:04.998
I wanted to inquire about something.

27:05.081 --> 27:09.836
Is Mr. Choi running the orphanage?

27:10.587 --> 27:12.172
Yes

27:12.255 --> 27:14.966
My grandfather was poor, according to his words.

27:15.550 --> 27:18.053
His dream was to help those in need
if he had abundant money.

27:18.136 --> 27:19.471
Good

27:20.138 --> 27:22.891
Are you his granddaughter then?

27:23.475 --> 27:28.104
no. I was transferred to the orphanage after my parents died.

27:28.188 --> 27:29.814
Good. I'm sorry

27:30.440 --> 27:32.567
Oh God. I shouldn't have brought this up.

27:33.860 --> 27:35.528
Never mind.

27:36.112 --> 27:36.946
I'm sorry

27:39.741 --> 27:41.618
What food do you like, Hyun Joo?

27:43.119 --> 27:43.953
In reality

27:45.413 --> 27:46.998
I love rolled omelettes.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.376
Good. Eat some of these.

27:50.627 --> 27:53.046
Wow! Where is the rolled omelette?

27:54.589 --> 27:57.842
You both had to leave some for Hyun Joo.

28:03.181 --> 28:05.850
This is correct. I wanted her.

28:10.355 --> 28:11.481
Let me prepare more for you.

28:11.564 --> 28:12.565
It's not your fault

28:12.649 --> 28:14.901
No, it won't take long. Wait a minute.

28:14.984 --> 28:16.903
Make it big and thick, mom.

28:16.986 --> 28:18.321
Good

28:18.405 --> 28:19.614
Prepare a lot please.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.783
Okay, I'll make it big.

28:24.285 --> 28:25.286
Hurry up and eat.

28:32.377 --> 28:35.547
“Go to the bookstore
the day after tomorrow and transfer all the money.”

28:51.771 --> 28:53.773
"(Jun Min Kim)"

29:24.095 --> 29:24.929
take care of yourself

29:51.623 --> 29:53.208
- Have you packed everything?
- Yes.

30:25.990 --> 30:27.992
the curse. it's scary

32:30.156 --> 32:32.075
Start making boxes. I'll bring the money.

32:32.158 --> 32:33.826
How are we going to get her to the car?

32:33.910 --> 32:34.994
We will carry it.

32:35.078 --> 32:37.747
No, this will take too long.
Vehicle security?

32:37.830 --> 32:40.458
Yes. It's in the storage room
at the bottom left.

32:40.541 --> 32:42.293
Woo Jin and I will go get her.

32:42.377 --> 32:44.212
Arrange the money on the floor.

32:44.295 --> 32:45.338
- Okay.
- Come on.

33:56.659 --> 33:59.078
How strong you are.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.321
What do you do

34:33.905 --> 34:35.281
Don't let him catch you.

34:35.364 --> 34:37.408
- Who is he?
- The man I told you about then.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.577
the curse

35:48.980 --> 35:50.606
Hit and dodge more quickly.

35:50.690 --> 35:51.691
Good

36:33.482 --> 36:35.318
You bastard.

37:17.985 --> 37:18.861
Damn

37:29.580 --> 37:31.165
damn it

39:09.221 --> 39:11.182
just chill. Stop, that's enough.

39:13.059 --> 39:14.852
its enough

39:17.021 --> 39:18.105
just chill

39:20.649 --> 39:21.609
it's all over

39:22.443 --> 39:25.029
All is well

39:29.200 --> 39:30.993
- Let's tie him up.
- Yes.

39:34.538 --> 39:36.540
- Let's find something to tie him to.
- Okay.

39:40.127 --> 39:42.213
- Go check that side.
- Okay.

39:47.551 --> 39:48.552
the curse

39:54.683 --> 39:55.768
"Woo Jin!"

39:57.228 --> 39:58.145
critical

40:01.565 --> 40:02.400
Wait.

40:04.610 --> 40:06.278
What is this? What happened to you?

40:06.362 --> 40:07.613
I had a fight.

40:07.696 --> 40:08.572
are you OK

40:08.656 --> 40:10.491
I'm going to be in terrible pain tomorrow.

40:10.991 --> 40:14.578
Why did you handcuff him in front? It will break it easily.

40:14.662 --> 40:16.122
I do not think so

40:16.205 --> 40:17.415
Do they need to be tied up again?

40:17.498 --> 40:19.750
Tie him up quickly. Bring the cart, Gun-woo.

40:19.834 --> 40:21.168
Good

40:22.086 --> 40:23.003
Hold his feet.

40:26.257 --> 40:27.967
Good. Let's go

40:30.136 --> 40:31.470
- Our jackets.
- Damn. quickly

40:31.554 --> 40:32.555
These are expensive.

40:42.481 --> 40:44.191
I handcuffed him here.

40:47.278 --> 40:49.280
He escaped because you tied him to a pipe.

40:50.030 --> 40:52.199
You had to get good at restraining him.

40:52.283 --> 40:53.117
Damn

41:11.552 --> 41:12.720
"(Jang Do Im)"

41:16.640 --> 41:17.641
What delayed you?

41:18.309 --> 41:20.227
We hit a snag.

41:20.311 --> 41:21.145
And wealth?

41:21.645 --> 41:23.898
Don't worry. The money is still there.

41:23.981 --> 41:25.524
Where are you going?

41:25.608 --> 41:27.193
I can't reach InBome.

41:27.276 --> 41:29.737
My face and mouth were badly cut,

41:30.404 --> 41:31.614
So I'll go through the emergency

41:31.697 --> 41:33.407
Before I return to the site of the event.

41:33.491 --> 41:34.408
what do you mean

41:34.909 --> 41:36.702
Clean up your mess before you leave.

41:36.785 --> 41:38.204
Okay. You are right sir.

41:38.287 --> 41:40.581
But my face is bleeding badly.

41:40.664 --> 41:42.374
My teeth are loose, so I have to...

41:42.458 --> 41:44.376
You damned bastard.

41:44.460 --> 41:47.421
Call Jung,
gather his men and eliminate them immediately.

41:48.464 --> 41:51.884
I want their heads, okay?
I see you trying to hold back, you bastard.

41:51.967 --> 41:53.469
Screw you. Do you want to die?

41:53.552 --> 41:57.223
Should I cut off your head
before I cut off their heads, you idiot?

41:58.140 --> 41:59.225
I will do what you ask.

42:00.184 --> 42:01.060
Sir

42:13.656 --> 42:14.698
Move!

42:16.784 --> 42:18.035
Get in the car quickly.

42:28.295 --> 42:29.296
Arma!

42:44.895 --> 42:46.355
- Open the trunk.
- Okay.

42:47.314 --> 42:48.148
Push it!

42:58.117 --> 42:59.493
I notice

42:59.577 --> 43:00.494
quickly

43:01.870 --> 43:02.871
Damn

43:05.457 --> 43:06.375
Okay, we're done.

43:06.458 --> 43:08.502
the curse. We have to get what's in the safe.

43:08.586 --> 43:09.837
Shouldn't we leave now?

43:09.920 --> 43:10.879
You are ahead of us.

43:10.963 --> 43:11.880
How many are there?

43:11.964 --> 43:13.465
Billions at least.

43:14.049 --> 43:14.925
I will help you.

43:15.426 --> 43:17.386
- He preceded us.
- Actually...

43:17.469 --> 43:21.307
We must come in billions.

43:21.390 --> 43:23.601
Start the car and wait. We will be back quickly.

43:24.101 --> 43:25.227
You must hurry.

43:28.814 --> 43:31.358
- Woo Jin, there's a bag under the closet.
- Okay.

43:36.196 --> 43:37.740
Wow! gold bar

43:37.823 --> 43:41.035
- Oh my God. Start packing it!
- Okay.

43:46.415 --> 43:47.416
Dollars?

43:48.000 --> 43:49.793
Do not sit still. Pack it.

43:50.461 --> 43:51.462
Good

44:20.699 --> 44:23.035
the curse. Someone was severely beaten.

44:23.786 --> 44:24.662
Are you well

44:27.623 --> 44:28.582
Follow me.

44:42.763 --> 44:44.056
Slow down.

44:44.139 --> 44:45.516
Why is there so much money?

44:49.311 --> 44:51.063
faster

44:51.146 --> 44:53.107
They are very heavy.

44:58.737 --> 44:59.613
Good

45:05.869 --> 45:06.704
Good

45:26.682 --> 45:27.850
Call Gun Woo.

45:31.937 --> 45:32.771
Yes, Woo Jin.

45:33.522 --> 45:35.399
Don't stop following me no matter what happens.

45:35.482 --> 45:36.316
Good

45:47.745 --> 45:48.871
Damn

45:51.290 --> 45:52.583
the curse

46:17.733 --> 46:19.443
Can you go faster, Gun-woo?

46:19.526 --> 46:21.779
I think the car is currently overloaded.

46:21.862 --> 46:23.530
When I give you my signal, you go ahead of me.

46:24.490 --> 46:25.449
Good. I'll try

46:30.370 --> 46:31.705
Get ahead of me now!

46:41.173 --> 46:42.174
Damn

47:11.745 --> 47:12.913
Screw it.

47:22.005 --> 47:22.965
Ride fast.

47:38.605 --> 47:40.107
They are coming. Hurry more!

47:40.607 --> 47:42.025
There's a disturbance in the car!

47:56.081 --> 47:57.082

Push! more

49:56.243 --> 49:59.204
The car broke down. Get down.
We have to get the two bags.

Run!

50:12.884 --> 50:13.885
Run. quickly
