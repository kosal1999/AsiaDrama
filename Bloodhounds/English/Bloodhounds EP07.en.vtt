00:09.009 --> 00:10.802
Is it certain that the patient is fine?

00:10.885 --> 00:12.095
Blood pressure drops again.

00:12.178 --> 00:13.930
Wait. I will check.

01:01.352 --> 01:02.771
You should eat this.

01:04.856 --> 01:06.858
You should be well fed today.

01:06.941 --> 01:08.193
I thank you

01:08.276 --> 01:09.194
pardon

01:32.675 --> 01:35.929
I apologize. The young woman who was here,
do you know where she went?

01:36.012 --> 01:37.430
I left a while ago.

01:37.514 --> 01:38.932
when

01:39.516 --> 01:40.850
About ten minutes ago.

01:42.560 --> 01:43.436
Thanks

02:48.251 --> 02:49.419
Excuse me

02:50.753 --> 02:53.423
Are you the one taking care of Woo Jin Hong?

02:53.965 --> 02:55.258
Yes

02:56.092 --> 02:57.719
The surgery was successful.

02:58.761 --> 03:02.223
We have to keep him under observation
but the surgery was successful.

03:11.065 --> 03:12.901
Thanks

03:14.944 --> 03:16.696
Thank you very much

03:19.991 --> 03:21.159
hang in there

03:21.659 --> 03:23.161
Good

03:58.905 --> 04:02.283
"Catch outside the ring"

04:17.757 --> 04:20.718
"Spirit of the Navy, Myung-Gil Kim."

05:02.010 --> 05:02.927
Willah

05:03.886 --> 05:05.555
It scares me every time.

05:07.098 --> 05:07.932
Let's go

05:18.151 --> 05:18.985
Let's go

05:25.283 --> 05:26.117
Let's run.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.014
‫86.‬

07:49.051 --> 07:50.803
Wow, it really worked!

07:58.728 --> 08:00.521
Get up, Woo Jin.

08:02.857 --> 08:05.818
To upset their balance,
we have to follow this method to overthrow them...

08:05.902 --> 08:07.028
Listen.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.113
We have to talk.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.035
I said no

08:14.785 --> 08:17.288
If you go back, you will die a useless death.

08:18.456 --> 08:21.751
I understand why you're worried about us, Mr. Oh.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.377
Why don't you listen to me then?

08:23.920 --> 08:25.004
Do you rebel?

08:25.505 --> 08:26.756
Mr. Oh.

08:27.381 --> 08:29.717
I'll tell you what I think today.

08:32.053 --> 08:35.097
I believe we can take on Myung-Gil Kim
and beat him.

08:40.603 --> 08:43.064
Yang Jung and Do Young are dead.

08:43.648 --> 08:44.774
How will you overcome it?

08:44.857 --> 08:47.944
Following Mr. Choi's instructions.

08:50.112 --> 08:53.866
Many have lost their families
, and Kim has robbed them of everything they hold dear.

08:54.450 --> 08:57.245
If we can bring them together and join forces, Mr. Choi said ,

08:57.328 --> 08:59.288
We will overcome it no matter what happens.

09:00.456 --> 09:03.000
Everyone hides because they are unable to confront
and win alone.

09:03.084 --> 09:07.713
But if they find people like me and Wu Jin,
I'm sure they'll help us.

09:08.798 --> 09:11.926
What if Myung Gil Kim catches
you both before this is done?

09:12.009 --> 09:13.678
We can fight.

09:13.761 --> 09:16.597
Woo Jin has made a full recovery
and I've crossed two weight classes.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.099
My punches are stronger now.

09:18.182 --> 09:20.893
We are fully prepared to eliminate his thugs.

09:20.977 --> 09:23.479
If we take everyone's advice,

09:23.563 --> 09:26.148
I think we can eliminate
Myung Gil Kim.

09:27.775 --> 09:30.611
I won't allow it,

09:31.696 --> 09:32.738
This is my final decision.

10:12.945 --> 10:16.907
I will be in Rome by the time you read this letter,
Mr. Oh.

10:18.117 --> 10:21.787
I rented a small room
with the money my grandfather gave me.

10:22.997 --> 10:25.791
I promised my grandfather that we would go to Rome together

10:25.875 --> 10:27.585
After the elimination of Myung Gil Kim,

10:28.169 --> 10:29.920
But I ruined everything.

10:31.505 --> 10:33.924
I will not ask you to understand my actions.

10:34.925 --> 10:39.055
But if I stay here,
I'll be thinking about my grandfather and I don't think I can bear that.

10:40.222 --> 10:42.558
Every place I go reminds me of my grandfather,

10:43.601 --> 10:45.478
And I can't stop crying.

10:46.145 --> 10:47.605
This makes me crazy.

10:48.522 --> 10:51.233
I'll feel better if I stay away.

10:52.610 --> 10:53.527
I love you

10:54.278 --> 10:55.196
And I'm sorry.

11:08.584 --> 11:10.336
This is so painful, man.

11:11.045 --> 11:12.922
What you're feeling is not pain, Woo-jin.

11:13.005 --> 11:14.965
It is the feeling that accompanies the disappearance of your weaknesses.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.425
What does this mean?

11:17.551 --> 11:19.595
It means that you are stronger today than yesterday.

11:24.225 --> 11:25.059
Listen.

11:26.268 --> 11:27.228
Follow me.

11:30.856 --> 11:31.691
Yes sir.

11:49.917 --> 11:53.129
This is the last of Mr. Choi's money saved
for emergencies.

11:53.963 --> 11:54.964
Take it and move on.

11:55.881 --> 11:59.552
I apologize for trying to keep you here because I'm worried about you.

12:00.344 --> 12:02.555
I'll arrange a room and a car for you in Seoul.

12:03.431 --> 12:04.432
May God bless you both.

12:06.434 --> 12:08.686
Thank you, Mr. Oh.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.733
We will win no matter what.

12:47.016 --> 12:52.563
"(Stone Village)"

12:56.150 --> 12:57.151
Unit 809.

13:00.654 --> 13:01.655
"Woo Jin."

13:11.707 --> 13:12.541
Yes

13:16.879 --> 13:17.838
Welcome

13:17.922 --> 13:21.050
We sent Mr. In Mok Oh.

13:29.767 --> 13:30.601
Come in.

13:30.684 --> 13:31.811
Let's go

13:40.778 --> 13:45.449
Now if you go back and notice any trace
of tampering with the tape,

13:45.533 --> 13:47.243
I will report you to the police.

13:47.952 --> 13:48.786
Why

13:49.620 --> 13:50.871
My panties are in it.

13:51.997 --> 13:54.333
No, that will never happen.

13:56.210 --> 13:58.003
There is a bed here and another one upstairs.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.713
Who wants the one on top?

13:59.797 --> 14:01.215
- It doesn't matter which one.
- Yes.

14:02.216 --> 14:03.342
Then to you who is above.

14:03.425 --> 14:04.343
Good

14:04.426 --> 14:08.931
I'm sorry but may I ask the reason for your decision?

14:10.349 --> 14:11.392
For no reason

14:12.643 --> 14:13.477
Concept

14:16.814 --> 14:19.984
Here are the keys to the door and the car
my grandfather asked me to rent.

14:22.319 --> 14:25.155
This is my number too but don't call if possible.

14:25.239 --> 14:26.073
I am busy

14:26.740 --> 14:28.701
-Is this acceptable?
-Yes.

14:29.493 --> 14:30.327
okay then

14:38.460 --> 14:39.461
Thanks

14:45.426 --> 14:46.343
Wait a minute.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.597
Did she point to Mr. Oh, saying he was her grandfather?

14:49.680 --> 14:51.390
Yes, she must be his granddaughter.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.854
correct. I find that they are similar
once I think about it.

14:56.937 --> 14:58.939
They have a small body and wear glasses.

15:00.399 --> 15:03.235
But didn't it look like she was forced
to lend her apartment?

15:03.319 --> 15:04.445
- Isn't it?
- Right.

15:05.988 --> 15:06.864
I feel bad

15:07.865 --> 15:09.074
Enough talking about that.

15:09.158 --> 15:11.535
- Let's shower and make a plan.
- Okay.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.414
- Oh God, my stomach hurts so bad.
- I'm in pain.

15:38.771 --> 15:39.647
What's the reason

15:39.730 --> 15:42.983
I think we should catch Jae Myung Yang
first to gather information.

15:43.067 --> 15:43.984
what about you

15:46.779 --> 15:48.113
"Mr. Moon, President M."

15:48.197 --> 15:50.741
I think we need to gather allies first.

15:50.824 --> 15:52.534
Moving together will result in solidarity.

15:52.618 --> 15:53.869
I like this idea too.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.790
But how will we find it?

15:57.873 --> 16:00.209
Mr. Choi said he would be our best helper.

16:01.168 --> 16:05.130
I thought about that on our way to Seoul,
but meeting the heir to the Isle Group wouldn't be easy.

16:05.214 --> 16:07.091
I'll come up with a plan somehow.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.599
- “Woo Jin”!
- What?

16:21.397 --> 16:23.232
You can open the roof in this model.

16:23.315 --> 16:24.733
-The roof is retractable?
-Yes.

16:25.317 --> 16:26.527
It's cloth.

16:36.954 --> 16:37.788
O'Brother

16:40.916 --> 16:42.626
Lots of loan sharks in Myeongdong.

16:42.710 --> 16:45.212
Smile Capital fooled them as well as you.

16:45.295 --> 16:47.673
I suggest that we bring them together and form a united front.

16:47.756 --> 16:49.967
Money lenders in this neighborhood...

16:50.050 --> 16:52.094
You know them all with your relationships.

16:52.177 --> 16:55.806
If you lead, those people will follow suit.

16:58.350 --> 16:59.268
And then what?

16:59.351 --> 17:01.395
You can get your money back

17:01.478 --> 17:05.274
She is keen to ensure that Smile Capital does not pull
this type of trick again.

17:06.191 --> 17:08.110
We will wipe them out of existence. What is your opinion

17:08.193 --> 17:10.154
I lost a few hundred million.

17:16.952 --> 17:18.037
I can't do this.

17:19.496 --> 17:21.707
If your plan fails, I may die.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.375
What about the money you lost?

17:23.459 --> 17:24.918
Screw the money.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.297
I can make up for it, okay?

17:28.380 --> 17:29.840
I will not interfere.

17:29.923 --> 17:32.468
I care more about my life than money.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.595
- Please, just this once...
- Stop.

17:50.527 --> 17:52.237
What is this

17:54.073 --> 17:55.032
What happened

17:57.409 --> 17:59.328
my lord

18:01.371 --> 18:03.040
Entry is not allowed here.

18:04.166 --> 18:07.211
Well, they're little marines.

18:07.795 --> 18:08.921
What happened sir?

18:09.880 --> 18:10.714
What

18:11.423 --> 18:12.341
In reality

18:13.801 --> 18:14.927
a few days ago,

18:15.427 --> 18:18.430
A group of gangsters came and took everything.

18:19.640 --> 18:20.557
Why

18:29.358 --> 18:32.569
I have ten million bonds
that will expire in a month.

18:33.237 --> 18:38.575
If you return this money to me,
I will give you five percent of it.

18:39.868 --> 18:43.372
It's too much money to pass up.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.415
Shall we make a deal then?

18:47.626 --> 18:52.172
Surely a classy lady like you
doesn't know how to make a deal.

18:52.256 --> 18:54.550
Such issues

18:55.217 --> 18:57.386
Be based on mutual trust.

18:58.262 --> 19:00.347
This is what follows.

19:06.687 --> 19:07.980
I will find someone else.

19:10.190 --> 19:12.526
Wait, wait a minute.

19:13.110 --> 19:16.822
Every rule generally has an exception.

19:22.327 --> 19:23.203
"(Gwang Mu Moon)"

19:23.287 --> 19:24.913
I found out the truth later.

19:24.997 --> 19:28.959
In the middle of that decade and in a fine line

19:29.042 --> 19:31.712
It was written that if I failed to return the bonds
within a month,

19:31.795 --> 19:34.298
I have to pay them half the amount.

19:34.381 --> 19:35.841
That's what was written.

19:39.136 --> 19:41.889
That contract looks like a Smile Capital contract.

19:42.514 --> 19:43.807
What are you

19:43.891 --> 19:46.185
A company run by Myung Gil Kim.

19:47.561 --> 19:49.730
Who worked for Mr. Choi?

19:50.355 --> 19:51.190
Yes

19:51.273 --> 19:53.483
Where is that bastard now?

19:54.693 --> 19:57.654
Did you hear about what happened to Mr. Choi, sir?

19:58.405 --> 19:59.239
Did you hear what?

19:59.948 --> 20:00.824
Mr. Choi...

20:04.036 --> 20:05.871
Myung Gil Kim killed him.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.294
What are you talking about?

20:12.377 --> 20:16.131
Myung-Gil Kim killed Mr. Choi,
Mr. Hwang, and Mr. Lee. Kill them all.

20:19.009 --> 20:22.012
We were hiding out in the countryside
with Mr. Oh until recently.

20:22.095 --> 20:25.474
Damn, your talk is not funny at all.

20:32.356 --> 20:34.316
This is not funny, is it clear?

20:58.507 --> 20:59.967
Why would Mr. Choi die?

21:01.426 --> 21:02.261
Why

21:03.887 --> 21:04.805
For any reason he may die

21:05.889 --> 21:06.974
Mr. Choi?

21:09.142 --> 21:11.853
Answer me, you scoundrels!

21:11.937 --> 21:12.854
Damn

21:15.774 --> 21:19.027
What do you mean by saying he died, you idiots?

21:35.460 --> 21:36.795
I'm tired

21:36.878 --> 21:37.921
I am very tired

21:39.506 --> 21:41.049
Let's go in and have a little rest.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.217
Yes sir.

21:47.014 --> 21:48.015
What is this

21:51.268 --> 21:52.269
been a long time

21:54.980 --> 21:56.982
- These two motherfuckers.
- Damn.

22:10.162 --> 22:13.290
I'll tell you everything, so don't hit me, okay?

22:13.915 --> 22:15.876
The news spread among the homeless,

22:15.959 --> 22:19.379
We collect ID cards
in facilities for people with special needs.

22:19.463 --> 22:20.714
We didn't ask about you.

22:20.797 --> 22:22.466
What's going on at Smile Capital?

22:23.300 --> 22:26.011
You should both be more specific
in your questions.

22:26.094 --> 22:27.888
Is the club open?

22:29.931 --> 22:30.766
wait a moment

22:31.266 --> 22:32.267
Look down.

22:35.270 --> 22:36.104
What is the matter

22:38.982 --> 22:41.109
Gun Woo, try to play the violent person.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.195
How to do it

22:43.278 --> 22:45.113
First stop treating him with respect.

22:46.782 --> 22:51.495
But this man is clearly over 40.
It wouldn't be comfortable for me to talk down to him.

22:52.412 --> 22:56.124
Good. If he looks at you with disdain, slap him hard.

22:57.250 --> 22:58.168
Good

23:02.589 --> 23:05.842
First, you may not believe this,
but I'm 31 years old.

23:05.926 --> 23:08.970
Secondly, I do not disdain you both
, so there is no need for violence.

23:09.054 --> 23:11.139
My physical condition is currently deteriorating.

23:11.223 --> 23:14.267
A while ago, a scoundrel cut off the Achilles in my heel.

23:14.351 --> 23:16.728
So I spent four months in a rehabilitation center.

23:16.812 --> 23:19.398
That bastard is our brother, so watch your words.

23:20.107 --> 23:23.985
I am completely to blame for what happened to me then.
I really deserved what was done to me.

23:25.320 --> 23:26.321
So, the club...

23:26.947 --> 23:27.864
Okay

23:27.948 --> 23:30.075
I had eavesdropped on the director's call...

23:30.158 --> 23:32.202
the boss? What is his name

23:32.285 --> 23:33.161
"Jun Min Kim."

23:35.580 --> 23:36.415
Is he alive?

23:36.498 --> 23:39.126
A scoundrel had his neck cut and he almost died...

23:39.209 --> 23:40.585
the curse

23:41.503 --> 23:44.339
That's right, you're all on the same team.

23:45.590 --> 23:48.718
Well, I understand everything completely now.

23:48.802 --> 23:52.222
I will be careful with my words from now on,
so there is no need to hit me, sir.

23:52.305 --> 23:55.392
I really hate Jun Min Kim.
That motherfucker is a bastard.

23:55.475 --> 23:57.519
And Smile Capital is a bunch of scoundrels too.

23:57.602 --> 23:59.479
I only work for her for the money.

23:59.563 --> 24:02.107
I wanted to disclose what was happening. I will tell you everything.

24:02.190 --> 24:04.568
We understand that, so please get to the point.

24:04.651 --> 24:08.822
I heard a call. They are still in dispute
with the Aile Group over the contract,

24:08.905 --> 24:11.658
And I heard that Myung Gil Kim is upset.

24:12.159 --> 24:13.201
and what

24:13.285 --> 24:15.537
Jang Do Im is not on good terms
with Joon Min Kim.

24:15.620 --> 24:16.997
He's really a scoundrel, isn't he?

24:17.080 --> 24:20.041
He used to lead the police
, but one day he disappeared.

24:20.125 --> 24:23.044
But Myung Gil Kim was having fun
at a hostess bar recently,

24:23.128 --> 24:25.839
He fought with a clumsy person and broke his wrist.

24:26.423 --> 24:28.758
So the police were called and it was a crisis.

24:28.842 --> 24:30.802
But it went on as if nothing had happened.

24:30.886 --> 24:34.848
This is not supposed to be the case
when the police are called to appear.

24:34.931 --> 24:39.186
According to Jeon Min Kim, Myung Gil Kim
has found a replacement for Jang Do Im.

24:39.269 --> 24:41.605
But he hasn't told anyone yet.

24:42.230 --> 24:43.440
Why

24:43.523 --> 24:45.233
He doesn't trust his men.

24:46.401 --> 24:47.486
and what else

24:47.569 --> 24:50.864
He's planning to take
over a golf course in Gyeonggi-do.

24:50.947 --> 24:53.408
That's why we overwork ourselves
like this.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.744
We are underpaid
but they overwork us.

24:55.827 --> 24:57.412
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

24:58.955 --> 25:00.999
This concludes my summary of current issues.

25:04.044 --> 25:05.253
wait a moment

25:12.594 --> 25:16.014
You know you'll get killed if we send this
to Joon Min Kim, right?

25:16.097 --> 25:17.140
Keep your mouth shut.

25:17.224 --> 25:18.558
Don't worry sir.

25:19.100 --> 25:21.811
If you need anything,
do not hesitate to contact me.

25:21.895 --> 25:24.648
I too want to see Smile Capital
crash and burn.

25:24.731 --> 25:27.901
So can you get us the phone number
of the Isle heir?

25:28.610 --> 25:30.403
This is beyond my capabilities.

25:30.904 --> 25:33.698
These people maintain their privacy.

25:35.825 --> 25:37.327
"Son of the eldest chairman of the Ile Group."

25:41.122 --> 25:42.582
"Isle's heir and his trust to create a world-class hotel."

25:42.666 --> 25:46.545
Understood. His name is Min Beom Hong.
His last name is the same as my last name.

25:47.128 --> 25:47.963
"Woo Jin."

25:48.588 --> 25:50.632
"Sol" has the most delicious black vermicelli.

25:50.715 --> 25:51.716
Okay

25:56.638 --> 25:59.307
Why did you use my computer without my permission?

25:59.391 --> 26:01.726
I'm signed in to all the messaging apps on it.

26:01.810 --> 26:04.646
I'm sorry. We didn't open any of the apps.

26:05.939 --> 26:07.482
Go to an internet café nearby.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.359
Good. I'm sorry

26:09.442 --> 26:10.735
Hurry up and turn it off.

26:10.819 --> 26:11.778
Concept

26:11.861 --> 26:13.280
Let's use it just this once.

26:14.823 --> 26:15.865
They accomplished it quickly.

26:15.949 --> 26:16.825
Good

26:17.409 --> 26:18.451
We are sorry.

26:18.535 --> 26:19.536
How tiring.

26:21.788 --> 26:22.706
how did you know

26:22.789 --> 26:26.167
She must have received a login notification
when we turned on the computer.

26:36.469 --> 26:38.096
- Shit.
- What's going on?

26:38.179 --> 26:41.266
Min Beom Hong has 500,000 followers.

26:42.642 --> 26:43.685
Let's see now.

27:03.246 --> 27:04.748
Hey, stop.

27:29.189 --> 27:30.065
Didn't I ask you...

27:32.025 --> 27:35.528
Have the contract ready by today so I can
send the money?

27:36.780 --> 27:38.114
I would do that,

27:39.532 --> 27:40.909
But my father...

27:40.992 --> 27:43.161
You bastard. how dare you

27:57.092 --> 27:57.926
"By day."

28:11.272 --> 28:13.942
Don't kill me please.

28:15.485 --> 28:19.906
Amend the contract as requested and bring it to me
by Friday.

28:19.989 --> 28:21.825
- Okay.
- If you don't, I'll post the video.

28:21.908 --> 28:26.329
I will work to show
that you committed suicide as a result of the video's spread, okay?

28:29.874 --> 28:31.918
Your order, sir.

29:18.590 --> 29:22.343
Want to get rid of Myung Gil Kim?
We can help you.

29:23.011 --> 29:25.263
Damn, who are these bastards?

29:28.558 --> 29:31.728
"We know where the hard drive
that contains the video is located."

29:32.979 --> 29:34.272
Let's meet them.

29:34.355 --> 29:36.441
If we're going to meet them, let's hurry.

29:36.941 --> 29:39.110
I must deliver the contract by Friday.

29:39.194 --> 29:41.112
Then ask them if they can meet us now.

29:41.196 --> 29:42.572
What to do if they agree?

29:42.655 --> 29:44.157
Meet them at the bar you're going to.

29:44.240 --> 29:46.326
Their true colors will be revealed once they get drunk.

29:47.327 --> 29:48.578
the curse

29:51.080 --> 29:53.708
Don't worry. I will assign two of my men to attend.

30:07.388 --> 30:08.348
“Inseong.”

30:08.431 --> 30:09.599
- Yes.
- It tastes delicious?

30:09.682 --> 30:11.017
Yes sir

30:11.100 --> 30:12.977
I asked you not to drink alcohol. the curse

30:13.520 --> 30:14.562
Your order, sir.

30:17.315 --> 30:18.441
"Woo Jin."

30:21.402 --> 30:22.904
Hello sir

30:23.404 --> 30:24.405
Hello sir

30:28.409 --> 30:30.662
I'm close "min day".

30:31.162 --> 30:32.664
Good. I'm Gun Woo Kim.

30:33.581 --> 30:34.916
And I'm Wu Jinhong.

30:34.999 --> 30:36.626
I am the one who wrote to you.

30:37.836 --> 30:38.670
Angels.

30:39.337 --> 30:40.338
Okay sir.

30:45.635 --> 30:48.304
Why don't we discuss it over a drink?

30:48.388 --> 30:49.389
In reality

30:51.766 --> 30:52.892
In reality

30:54.435 --> 30:56.145
I really apologize for this

30:56.980 --> 30:59.357
But Myung Gil Kim's thugs stabbed me

30:59.440 --> 31:02.694
It tore up my liver, so I can't drink alcohol.

31:04.904 --> 31:09.492
If you don't want to drink alcohol,
say so. decent

31:15.331 --> 31:16.541
It is the truth, sir.

31:16.624 --> 31:18.209
Here and here.

31:19.127 --> 31:19.961
And here.

31:22.088 --> 31:23.506
We get it.

31:24.299 --> 31:26.009
It's annoying to see. Take your shirt down.

31:26.092 --> 31:27.886
Well, don't drink with us then.

31:28.678 --> 31:29.596
Were you stabbed too?

31:29.679 --> 31:32.390
no. I don't just drink.

31:35.268 --> 31:37.478
We will go deeper into our conversation. Let's drink wine.

31:41.357 --> 31:45.904
Didn't you meet us here to talk frankly?

31:45.987 --> 31:49.574
If you refuse to fulfill such a trivial request,
how can we trust you?

31:49.657 --> 31:51.659
If I may be permitted to speak frankly,

31:52.660 --> 31:55.204
Didn't you ask to meet us because you needed us?

32:03.963 --> 32:05.673
In this case, I'll take a glass.

32:06.215 --> 32:08.718
No, I'll drink.

32:12.680 --> 32:13.514
Good

32:16.684 --> 32:18.019
And now, Director Hong.

32:18.102 --> 32:19.187
Good

32:25.443 --> 32:26.361
Now, let's drink.

32:29.572 --> 32:30.657
lump sum

32:31.407 --> 32:32.241
Good

32:40.708 --> 32:42.961
Wow, you are naturally talented.

32:43.670 --> 32:46.798
Since we're busy, why not drink from bottles?

32:46.881 --> 32:48.508
This is how whiskey is drunk.

32:48.591 --> 32:49.968
OK here
you go

32:50.468 --> 32:52.595
- Please.
- Please.

33:42.478 --> 33:43.312
Wow.

33:43.396 --> 33:45.523
- Your messengers.
- Okay.

33:54.615 --> 33:56.659
Let's talk now.

34:02.373 --> 34:03.499
the curse

34:33.738 --> 34:34.655
this is funy

34:35.239 --> 34:37.075
Nice to meet you, Gang Young.

34:38.034 --> 34:40.703
I was getting nervous
because of that bastard Myung Gil Kim.

34:40.787 --> 34:43.081
- Call me my brother, man.
- My brother.

34:43.164 --> 34:45.333
Okay. I'm your brother. Okay, pour.
- Okay, sir.

34:46.125 --> 34:48.544
Because of that bastard,

34:50.004 --> 34:52.590
I got alopecia,

34:53.174 --> 34:55.009
And hemorrhoids, damn it.

34:55.676 --> 34:58.262
It hit me when I met him earlier today.

34:59.430 --> 35:00.348
The bastard.

35:00.431 --> 35:04.185
The police commissioner adores me!

35:04.268 --> 35:06.813
When alone, he says,
"Commissioner Min..."

35:06.896 --> 35:08.815
And I say, "Brother! Don't do that."

35:08.898 --> 35:11.984
“Calling me Commissioner Maine
might be misunderstood by people.”

35:13.319 --> 35:16.405
Take care of this young man, Gang Young,
as we have become close.

35:16.489 --> 35:18.658
Take good care of him. He seems like a good young man.

35:18.741 --> 35:22.370
You and Woo Jin, you two,
do whatever you want.

35:22.453 --> 35:25.164
Screw whatever,
I've got your back all the way.

35:25.248 --> 35:26.541
Shall I pour you wine?

35:26.624 --> 35:28.292
- I can't anymore.
- Okay, sir.

35:28.376 --> 35:29.919
I can't do this because of hemorrhoids.

35:30.002 --> 35:32.421
Damn, that's because I worked overtime yesterday.

35:32.505 --> 35:35.007
I can usually drink for
at least another two hours.

35:54.443 --> 35:55.736
Damn

36:06.622 --> 36:07.790
"Gang Young."

36:15.089 --> 36:16.632
What is this

36:18.467 --> 36:19.969
Did you sleep well, Minbeom?

36:21.971 --> 36:23.097
Did you sleep well

36:24.807 --> 36:26.392
what's going on

36:28.227 --> 36:32.273
We brought you home last night
to continue drinking.

36:32.356 --> 36:33.274
Good

36:33.816 --> 36:35.776
I prepared vermicelli, so I meant to wake you up.

36:35.860 --> 36:36.944
-We should eat.
-Okay.

36:37.028 --> 36:37.987
Please take a seat

36:38.988 --> 36:40.865
-Gunwoo, take this.
-Okay.

36:40.948 --> 36:42.867
- I'll wake up Gang Young.
- Okay.

36:42.950 --> 36:45.119
Damn, how much wine did you drink?

36:49.165 --> 36:50.708
"Gun-ho"? "Gunwoo"?

36:52.084 --> 36:52.960
My name is Gun Woo.

36:53.044 --> 36:53.961
Good

36:56.172 --> 36:57.423
Could you remind me of the plan?

36:57.506 --> 37:01.219
Gang Young will bring a computer expert
from the police agency.

37:01.302 --> 37:05.765
This person will hack Kim's phone
and then burn the hard drive in the safe.

37:05.848 --> 37:08.935
Vermicelli preparation is complete. You must eat and wake up.

37:09.018 --> 37:09.977
stand up

37:11.020 --> 37:15.316
We'll do it on Friday when Myung-gil
comes to the IL group to sign the contract.

37:15.399 --> 37:16.359
Who made this decision?

37:18.402 --> 37:19.278
You

37:20.905 --> 37:23.574
correct. Of course I am. Oh, let's eat.

37:23.658 --> 37:25.243
How much wine did you drink?

37:26.827 --> 37:27.662
I notice

37:32.541 --> 37:33.501
Good esophagus.

37:38.631 --> 37:39.632
eat the food

37:40.466 --> 37:42.593
Thank you for the food

37:49.600 --> 37:51.310
It's been a long time to eat food like this.

37:52.270 --> 37:53.396
You both excelled.

38:03.447 --> 38:05.116
The place is huge.

38:05.199 --> 38:06.784
The ceiling is very high.

38:06.867 --> 38:08.703
Wow, how many floors?

38:10.496 --> 38:11.539
Thanks

38:12.248 --> 38:13.791
- Hello everyone.
- You've arrived.

38:13.874 --> 38:15.501
Hello
Hello

38:17.795 --> 38:20.131
- Hello.
- Allow me to introduce my colleagues.

38:23.384 --> 38:24.427
Do it.

38:25.970 --> 38:28.222
I'm Sergeant Han Guo-yeon. Nice to meet you.

38:30.141 --> 38:30.975
Welcome

38:31.767 --> 38:34.770
I'm Team Leader Tae Young Kang,
from the Cybercrime Department.

38:34.854 --> 38:37.064
Let's keep my presence here secret. Nice to meet you.

38:37.148 --> 38:38.274
- Okay.
- Nice to meet you.

38:39.150 --> 38:42.486
Let's also keep my presence secret.
We all attended in secret.

38:42.570 --> 38:43.529
Good

38:43.612 --> 38:47.325
Taeyong is the
country's leading authority for combating cybercrime.

38:47.408 --> 38:50.661
I'll show you how to hack Kim's phone.

38:50.745 --> 38:51.871
And activate the safe.

38:51.954 --> 38:53.748
Good. There are two ways.

38:53.831 --> 38:55.416
The first is Wi-Fi.

38:55.499 --> 38:58.794
I'll put a small jammer in the conference room
to cut off the signal

38:58.878 --> 39:00.671
To temporarily block your Internet connection.

39:00.755 --> 39:03.758
This will naturally lead Kim
to connect to Wi-Fi.

39:03.841 --> 39:07.762
I will be able to hack the phone
once it connects to the communicator.

39:07.845 --> 39:10.056
Once I hacked his phone, it would be done.

39:10.139 --> 39:14.060
I also conducted preliminary research into vault applications
that the suspect might be using.

39:14.143 --> 39:15.686
As for the second method,

39:15.770 --> 39:18.356
We will make sure the suspect opens
a more direct crossing to us.

39:18.439 --> 39:21.901
Do you know how to scan QR codes
when entering buildings due to the pandemic?

39:21.984 --> 39:25.321
I will place a direct response code
at the entrance and have him scan it.

39:25.404 --> 39:26.989
Once he scans his phone,

39:27.073 --> 39:29.367
This will give me access to hack his phone.

39:29.450 --> 39:31.702
We will use both methods together.

39:32.286 --> 39:33.162
Wait.

39:35.998 --> 39:37.249
What should I do

39:38.542 --> 39:41.420
You must ensure that the suspect stays
connected to Wi-Fi;

39:41.504 --> 39:42.838
For as long as possible.

39:42.922 --> 39:46.050
I'm going to access his cloud storage
to get all the data,

39:46.133 --> 39:48.552
But it may take time depending on its size.

39:48.636 --> 39:49.720
If we're lucky,

39:49.804 --> 39:52.848
We will be able to find evidence of all his crimes

39:52.932 --> 39:54.308
He and his partners to put an end to them.

39:56.560 --> 39:57.645
But what to do...

39:59.647 --> 40:01.107
If that bastard finds out what's going on?

40:02.024 --> 40:03.401
Do you have a plan?

40:05.653 --> 40:09.740
We are moving forward with both options simultaneously
to prevent this from happening.

40:09.824 --> 40:13.202
No, this is not what is required. That's not...

40:15.496 --> 40:20.459
The matter will only be fixed by getting rid
of the hard drive tomorrow, no matter what the cost.

40:21.210 --> 40:23.587
I would take his phone from him if it were up to me.

40:23.671 --> 40:27.633
It's simple. It shouldn't be this hard.
You're making it too complicated.

40:28.968 --> 40:30.428
I'll take his phone.

40:31.053 --> 40:31.929
“Han Gu.”

40:35.891 --> 40:39.186
May I ask what's on the hard drive?

40:39.270 --> 40:40.521
Damn, unbelievable!

40:40.604 --> 40:42.064
Okay, listen...

40:43.983 --> 40:44.817
They remained silent.

40:45.651 --> 40:46.777
Okay sir.

40:50.865 --> 40:52.908
“Min Beom,” he accompanied me for a moment.

41:15.389 --> 41:16.265
"Who day?"

41:17.850 --> 41:19.226
You must be very nervous.

41:20.144 --> 41:22.354
This is a very difficult process.

41:23.147 --> 41:25.357
There are limits because it is informal.

41:25.441 --> 41:26.442
"Gang Young."

41:28.527 --> 41:31.822
If I don't get rid of this engine,
I'm going to have to deal with Kim forever.

41:31.906 --> 41:33.032
I'll be in big trouble.

41:33.115 --> 41:35.451
So I will do my best.

41:35.951 --> 41:37.661
Please trust me.

41:44.210 --> 41:45.169
Good

42:08.275 --> 42:09.777
It's not available.

42:15.783 --> 42:17.159
You're sure of this, right?

42:17.243 --> 42:18.118
certainly

42:57.366 --> 42:58.951
Please take your temperature.

43:01.537 --> 43:03.080
Scan the response code with your camera.

43:04.081 --> 43:06.166
Shouldn't it be the opposite?

43:06.250 --> 43:08.210
This is how our system works.

43:09.587 --> 43:11.505
It's an unusual procedure but that's okay.

43:20.306 --> 43:21.390
It works.

43:32.860 --> 43:35.237
- Okay.
- Great!

43:42.411 --> 43:43.495
What? What is the matter

43:43.579 --> 43:45.205
There's nothing in his file.

43:45.289 --> 43:46.457
Give me a moment.

43:55.841 --> 43:58.886
The vault application you mentioned is not here.

44:02.723 --> 44:04.058
Did you hear this?

44:04.141 --> 44:05.100
Yes

44:05.184 --> 44:07.603
Jang Do Im was in no position to lie.

44:10.397 --> 44:11.940
Is that bastard planning something?

44:20.699 --> 44:22.076
Oh my God

44:23.118 --> 44:24.119
Director Hong.

44:26.413 --> 44:27.706
How are you

44:50.062 --> 44:51.647
the curse

44:53.982 --> 44:54.858
What is the matter

44:56.318 --> 44:58.278
There's no app for a safe on his phone.

45:18.006 --> 45:19.299
This bastard has two phones.

45:20.759 --> 45:21.927
what do you mean

45:22.010 --> 45:25.431
He scanned the code with a black phone, but this phone is silver.

45:28.600 --> 45:29.435
What to do now

45:29.518 --> 45:31.395
We have to pay it to connect to wifi.

45:41.864 --> 45:43.741
Mr. Min is coming here.

45:48.662 --> 45:49.955
- Sir.
- Never mind.

45:50.038 --> 45:51.749
-Do you want anything?
-I don't want anything.

46:00.215 --> 46:01.216
How did it go?

46:01.925 --> 46:03.594
Myung-Gil Kim has two phones.

46:03.677 --> 46:05.763
We hacked one but there was no app for a vault.

46:06.472 --> 46:08.807
The phone with the app is in that bag.

46:09.308 --> 46:10.142
and what

46:11.518 --> 46:12.853
We think of a solution.

46:12.936 --> 46:16.231
There's no time, Gang Young.
It won't take long.

46:19.485 --> 46:21.278
Why don't we talk privately?

46:21.361 --> 46:22.237
Damn

46:24.198 --> 46:25.741
Tae Young, Han Gu.

46:25.824 --> 46:28.035
Could you give us a moment?

46:28.619 --> 46:29.495
naturally

46:34.708 --> 46:37.419
What did Jang Do Im use
to film the video?

46:38.253 --> 46:39.171
Cell phone

46:39.254 --> 46:42.216
Wouldn't M have sent the video
to Myung Gul Kim's phone then?

46:42.299 --> 46:43.801
To confirm his portrayal?

46:43.884 --> 46:45.052
Okay

46:45.135 --> 46:49.473
Before you sign the contract,
ask him to delete the clip first.

46:49.973 --> 46:52.184
He would then have no choice but to take out his phone.

46:52.267 --> 46:53.727
What if he did not send it?

46:53.811 --> 46:55.646
What if Kim lies about this?

46:56.855 --> 46:59.566
Ask him to show you
the conversation he had with Jang Do Im.

46:59.650 --> 47:03.028
Tell him that Jang Do Im told you
that he intended to send him to his leader.

47:03.111 --> 47:04.530
truly

47:04.613 --> 47:07.241
Criminals like Myung Gil Kim
don't trust anyone.

47:07.324 --> 47:10.410
To make sure that Jang Do Im
got the job done properly,

47:10.494 --> 47:13.497
It is certain that he was asked
to send the video after completing the task.

47:21.421 --> 47:22.881
I don't think I can do that.

47:25.843 --> 47:26.969
Believe me

47:27.052 --> 47:28.262
No, this is not the problem.

47:29.263 --> 47:31.640
I don't think I can
stand up to Myung Gil Kim.

47:35.394 --> 47:36.770
I am afraid

47:39.022 --> 47:41.650
Damn, my hands are shaking just looking at him!

47:48.282 --> 47:49.116
"Who day?"

47:53.620 --> 47:56.790
I'm sure you can do this.

47:58.458 --> 48:01.503
I'll break down the door and break in
if I feel there's a problem.

48:01.587 --> 48:03.839
If things get out of control,

48:05.173 --> 48:08.176
I will use all our family's resources to protect you.

48:10.512 --> 48:12.222
So gather your courage this time.

48:18.687 --> 48:21.273
We will go there with him, Min Beom.

48:21.940 --> 48:23.358
You can do this.

48:43.795 --> 48:45.839
You're late for us.

48:46.632 --> 48:47.716
Where were you

48:48.884 --> 48:50.761
Can the two lawyers come out?

48:51.720 --> 48:54.056
I want to have privacy with Mr. Kim.

48:54.139 --> 48:55.015
certainly

49:08.946 --> 49:10.697
Do you want to get arrested?

49:18.580 --> 49:21.416
Where did you get this boldness?

49:21.917 --> 49:23.502
Before we sign the contract,

49:24.294 --> 49:25.796
Delete the video.

49:28.090 --> 49:29.049
He's at home.

49:30.759 --> 49:33.804
I promise to delete it at home
as soon as we sign the contract.

49:35.764 --> 49:37.099
Are you kidding me?

49:38.141 --> 49:40.560
I know your man sent it to your phone.

49:43.981 --> 49:45.649
Delete it while I see you doing it.

50:03.834 --> 50:04.710
Wow.

50:23.270 --> 50:25.063
- Here I delete it.
- No.

50:26.231 --> 50:27.983
Let me delete it myself.

50:29.067 --> 50:29.901
I do not trust you

50:31.778 --> 50:32.654
And if I refuse?

50:33.905 --> 50:35.699
I won't sign the contract then.

50:37.075 --> 50:38.326
I see you've completely lost your mind.

50:40.579 --> 50:41.413
Listen

50:43.457 --> 50:46.209
You think my family won't move if you touch me?

50:47.210 --> 50:49.254
I was acting alone because I was embarrassed.

50:49.755 --> 50:52.382
I secretly wanted to solve this crisis.

50:53.592 --> 50:54.426
correct

50:55.135 --> 50:57.054
My aunt is the director of the IRS.

50:57.137 --> 51:00.974
With one call from me, your company will be audited
the next day.

51:01.058 --> 51:02.100
What do you think

51:02.809 --> 51:06.855
Do you want to pay tens of billions in taxes?
Do you want this to be implemented?

51:14.571 --> 51:16.114
I became eloquent.

51:17.908 --> 51:19.201
When I see you threatening me.

51:20.077 --> 51:21.411
I learned from you

51:25.499 --> 51:26.500
I like this

51:29.503 --> 51:30.629
And I don't like this.

51:49.689 --> 51:50.941
"Wi-Fi is off"

51:51.024 --> 51:52.734
"Wi-Fi is on"

51:56.905 --> 51:57.906
We received a signal.

51:58.490 --> 51:59.574
Give me a moment.

52:06.540 --> 52:08.291
There is an application for a safe.

52:08.375 --> 52:11.336
- Great!
- Silence.

52:12.003 --> 52:13.171
I will open the safe now.

52:19.928 --> 52:21.805
Is that all your requests, Director Hong?

52:23.557 --> 52:24.808
Let's sign the contract.

52:35.652 --> 52:38.405
Good. Do I start burning?

52:50.000 --> 52:51.084
Good

52:51.168 --> 52:52.169
Good

52:57.007 --> 52:58.341
"Complete cremation is being carried out."

53:11.605 --> 53:12.814
It's done.

53:13.607 --> 53:16.401
- It really worked, right?
- Yes, certainly.

53:17.068 --> 53:19.696
- Thanks.
- I will extract the data first.

53:19.779 --> 53:21.573
Extract it all.

53:24.117 --> 53:25.327
Thank you both.

53:25.410 --> 53:27.037
No need for thanks

53:27.120 --> 53:28.622
I will collect all the evidence

53:28.705 --> 53:31.666
I will lock up that bastard, so don't worry.

53:31.750 --> 53:32.876
Okay sir.

53:42.385 --> 53:45.138
Well done you two. He'll call you both Gang Young.

53:45.222 --> 53:46.389
Fine, thank you

53:46.473 --> 53:47.474
Thanks

53:47.557 --> 53:49.768
This has been bothering me for a while, but...

53:50.602 --> 53:52.270
The wound you have, the scar.

53:53.230 --> 53:54.981
I would like to help you process it.

53:55.065 --> 54:00.445
Well, I'm grateful for that, but I'm fine.

54:01.112 --> 54:01.988
are you sure

54:02.072 --> 54:02.906
Yes

54:04.074 --> 54:07.994
Thanks to this scar, I was able to meet a lot
of wonderful people.

54:08.078 --> 54:11.581
You gave me the strength to keep going
instead of giving up.

54:12.415 --> 54:13.291
Therefore,

54:14.751 --> 54:16.169
I don't mind this scar.

54:17.003 --> 54:17.921
I understand this.

54:19.214 --> 54:20.048
See you soon.

54:20.131 --> 54:21.758
Well
Well

54:22.759 --> 54:23.718
Take care of them.

54:23.802 --> 54:24.928
- Yes.
- I will not go away.

54:25.011 --> 54:26.179
OK thanks

54:26.263 --> 54:27.222
Good day

54:30.725 --> 54:33.019
- I was relieved that it ended well.
- True.

54:35.855 --> 54:37.941
-I knew it would end well.
-Yes.

54:40.360 --> 54:42.112
- That's right, Gun Woo.
- Yes?

54:42.195 --> 54:46.992
Remember the question Mr. Choi asked
Jang Do Im about the gold bullion?

54:47.492 --> 54:50.954
Yes, and how is In Beom the only one who knows her whereabouts?

54:51.037 --> 54:51.871
Yes

54:51.955 --> 54:53.456
How much do you think it is worth?

54:54.916 --> 54:55.834
I don't know

54:56.876 --> 54:59.254
I think it's worth tens of billions.

55:00.964 --> 55:01.840
Good

55:03.383 --> 55:06.136
That includes the money
he stole from Mr. Choi, right?

55:06.219 --> 55:07.053
correct

55:07.595 --> 55:10.056
If the cops don't catch Myung Gil Kim,

55:10.974 --> 55:15.103
He will take the money and gold and flee out of the country.

55:16.062 --> 55:18.898
"We can't let that happen.
This is Mr. Choi's money."

55:19.607 --> 55:20.567
let's get ready

55:21.151 --> 55:23.653
Let's hunt him down and beat him to death.

55:24.154 --> 55:24.988
Seems like a good idea.

55:32.329 --> 55:35.081
- Let's drink ourselves unconscious tonight!
- Great!

55:35.165 --> 55:38.293
- Beom, Joon-min, well done!
- Sir!

55:38.376 --> 55:41.338
Well, let's continue drinking at my house!

55:43.882 --> 55:44.883
What is the matter

55:45.467 --> 55:47.010
Do you smell something?

55:47.927 --> 55:49.012
Eun-seo, what's wrong?

55:49.596 --> 55:52.182
Well, it smells like smoke I guess.

55:53.892 --> 55:55.477
Stay calm.

55:59.439 --> 56:00.273
do not you dare

56:18.249 --> 56:20.335
the curse

56:27.926 --> 56:29.344
Aden.

56:37.769 --> 56:39.938
"(Tae Ho Choi)"

56:58.415 --> 57:00.667
- Where are you?
- I'm working overtime, sir.

57:01.251 --> 57:03.878
I'll send a driver with a phone now.

57:04.462 --> 57:05.964
Find someone for me.

57:06.047 --> 57:07.382
How many people?

57:07.465 --> 57:09.050
We'll start with an old man.

57:09.634 --> 57:12.929
-Is it such an emergency?
-If I find him by tomorrow afternoon,

57:13.555 --> 57:15.223
I will pay you three times your wage.

57:16.683 --> 57:17.725
Your order, sir.

57:17.809 --> 57:22.689
