01:53.720 --> 01:54.920
I don't feel right today

01:57.000 --> 01:57.520
What's wrong

01:58.680 --> 01:59.800
I always feel like someone is following me

02:02.120 --> 02:02.680
Have you tested it?

02:04.280 --> 02:04.840
Not found

02:07.000 --> 02:08.320
Are you too sensitive?

02:10.520 --> 02:11.520
It's better to be more sensitive

02:15.640 --> 02:16.960
your relationship with that girl

02:17.320 --> 02:18.320
How far has it progressed?

02:20.840 --> 02:21.600
She has already started translating

02:21.720 --> 02:23.000
The last version of the tender document

02:25.079 --> 02:26.040
You can find an opportunity to start.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.200
Are things ready?

02:32.000 --> 02:32.600
Ready

02:38.400 --> 02:39.680
I'll take her back this weekend

02:42.960 --> 02:43.560
Will you stay?

02:48.360 --> 02:49.360
you can find a hotel

02:49.720 --> 02:50.600
No need to bring it back

02:51.720 --> 02:52.640
I've seen her and her friends

02:52.640 --> 02:53.320
chat record

02:54.320 --> 02:55.400
She has begun to doubt me

02:55.400 --> 02:56.240
I have another girlfriend

02:59.760 --> 03:01.080
Women's intuition is very accurate

03:03.040 --> 03:03.480
yes

03:04.760 --> 03:05.720
So I have to bring her back

03:06.240 --> 03:07.080
allay her concerns

03:12.520 --> 03:13.520
Wait until the mission is over

03:14.560 --> 03:15.480
Have to change place again

03:16.920 --> 03:17.360
Need not

03:19.040 --> 03:20.320
I will handle this relationship cleanly

03:22.760 --> 03:23.400
It's you

03:27.079 --> 03:28.200
He must be very busy recently

03:29.480 --> 03:30.360
Never came to the store

03:32.760 --> 03:33.680
Don't be impatient with him

03:36.280 --> 03:36.760
Not urgent

03:38.160 --> 03:38.800
I won't be in a hurry

03:38.800 --> 03:39.600
Brought him back

04:09.440 --> 04:10.360
Yao Yao

04:14.520 --> 04:15.560
Hello Yaoyao

04:16.200 --> 04:16.880
Something's wrong

04:17.480 --> 04:18.160
Feed uncle

04:18.600 --> 04:19.120
this late

04:19.200 --> 04:20.040
Didn't bother you?

04:20.320 --> 04:20.800
No no

04:21.040 --> 04:21.839
Don't bother, don't bother

04:22.000 --> 04:22.320
you say

04:23.520 --> 04:24.000
Is such that

04:24.600 --> 04:25.280
Where are we Zheyue?

04:25.400 --> 04:26.640
Opened a new column

04:27.040 --> 04:28.120
Just invite

04:28.280 --> 04:29.440
Elites in various fields

04:29.560 --> 04:30.360
conduct an interview

04:31.120 --> 04:32.680
would you like to be interviewed

04:34.080 --> 04:34.720
This matter

04:35.560 --> 04:36.800
Yao Yao, I'm sorry

04:37.159 --> 04:37.720
What about us

04:37.920 --> 04:39.600
You can't be interviewed casually

04:40.200 --> 04:42.200
Must apply in advance

04:45.040 --> 04:45.600
That's it

04:46.800 --> 04:47.920
Can you please

04:47.920 --> 04:48.280
follow us

04:48.280 --> 04:49.680
Biological research enthusiasts

04:49.720 --> 04:50.320
Say a few words

04:50.680 --> 04:52.120
We do it in our own name

04:52.600 --> 04:53.800
No professional issues involved

05:00.280 --> 05:01.720
If it really doesn’t work, forget it.

05:01.800 --> 05:02.200
uncle

05:02.720 --> 05:03.400
Zicheng also said

05:03.480 --> 05:04.440
You are usually busy

05:04.960 --> 05:05.920
Then go to bed early

05:06.640 --> 05:07.600
Zheyue this website

05:07.720 --> 05:08.360
I know

05:09.000 --> 05:10.720
The content is pretty good

05:11.520 --> 05:12.360
This is me

05:12.720 --> 05:13.400
I will try my best

05:13.640 --> 05:14.880
I try to take out as much time as possible

05:14.880 --> 05:15.960
Can I come to you?

05:16.960 --> 05:17.560
Really

05:18.000 --> 05:18.680
That's great

05:19.480 --> 05:21.160
Then let's make an appointment tomorrow

05:21.320 --> 05:22.040
How about uncle

05:22.560 --> 05:23.120
tomorrow

05:23.840 --> 05:24.880
tomorrow

05:25.080 --> 05:26.040
Then let's

05:26.200 --> 05:27.880
Take advantage of your lunch break

05:28.640 --> 05:28.960
OK

05:29.200 --> 05:30.240
Then I'll see my uncle tomorrow

05:30.320 --> 05:30.680
OK OK

05:31.000 --> 05:31.360
goodbye

05:31.360 --> 05:31.680
good

05:34.880 --> 05:36.000
Uncle has already agreed

05:37.080 --> 05:37.800
What about tomorrow?

05:37.920 --> 05:39.360
I'll try my best to buy you time

05:39.560 --> 05:40.600
I'll leave the rest to you

05:41.000 --> 05:41.600
can you do it

05:42.520 --> 05:43.760
Even if it doesn’t work, it has to work.

05:44.360 --> 05:45.080
Let's do it now

05:45.480 --> 05:46.480
There is another job

05:47.560 --> 05:48.159
What job

05:48.440 --> 05:49.320
Bargaining

05:49.640 --> 05:50.240
this task

05:50.480 --> 05:51.960
Worth at least five thousand gold coins

05:52.880 --> 05:53.240
right

05:53.480 --> 05:54.840
There must be rewards for doing tasks

05:55.000 --> 05:55.640
No more

05:56.640 --> 05:57.840
The bonus is half for each of us

05:58.000 --> 05:58.440
make a deal

06:03.440 --> 06:04.200
This is still a game

06:09.880 --> 06:11.440
If you are in Macau

06:11.840 --> 06:12.800
That document we got

06:12.840 --> 06:13.960
It's fine if it's fake

06:14.360 --> 06:15.720
It was originally fake

06:20.720 --> 06:21.400
All this

06:21.800 --> 06:22.800
It's just a game

06:23.440 --> 06:24.000
Believe me

06:24.680 --> 06:25.640
Wait until the game is over

06:26.080 --> 06:27.360
We will definitely make it ashore successfully

06:36.680 --> 06:37.440
I trust you

06:51.880 --> 06:53.360
Already reported to group leaders

06:53.480 --> 06:54.960
Be extremely careful when performing tasks

07:11.360 --> 07:11.960
Mr. Huang

07:14.400 --> 07:15.240
Please help me take a look

07:15.560 --> 07:15.880
this computer

07:15.960 --> 07:16.880
Why can't I connect?

07:17.600 --> 07:18.040
OK

07:23.240 --> 07:24.120
Hello technical department

07:24.560 --> 07:25.720
Mr. Huang’s office network

07:25.720 --> 07:26.360
Unable to connect

07:26.400 --> 07:27.400
Find someone to come and take a look

07:27.760 --> 07:28.240
right away

07:43.880 --> 07:44.480
Come in come in

07:45.480 --> 07:46.120
Didn't expect that

07:46.440 --> 07:46.960
So do you

07:46.960 --> 07:47.800
need my day

07:48.080 --> 07:48.880
hurry up hurry up

07:49.680 --> 07:50.640
Please help me take a look

07:51.440 --> 07:52.120
OK

07:53.320 --> 07:53.920
Let me see

07:54.800 --> 07:55.320
Don't mess with me

07:55.440 --> 07:56.440
What a mess

07:56.880 --> 07:58.040
I'm going to have guests later.

07:58.600 --> 07:59.200
I know

07:59.240 --> 08:00.160
Isn’t it Yao Yao?

08:00.280 --> 08:01.200
Not an outsider

08:01.480 --> 08:02.720
Be serious about your work attitude

08:03.360 --> 08:04.000
Is the leader

08:18.320 --> 08:18.800
Miss Yao

08:19.080 --> 08:19.440
Hello

08:20.040 --> 08:20.360
Hello

08:20.440 --> 08:21.280
I'm Mr. Huang's secretary

08:21.400 --> 08:22.560
Mr. Huang is waiting for you in the office

08:22.760 --> 08:23.440
Let's go straight there

08:24.000 --> 08:24.320
Hello

08:24.840 --> 08:25.640
Wait a mininute

08:31.560 --> 08:31.960
explain

08:32.600 --> 08:33.080
Mr. Huang

08:33.520 --> 08:34.760
Yao Yao from Zheyue Company has arrived

08:35.559 --> 08:37.080
Then let her come up directly

08:37.960 --> 08:39.360
She told us about the exhibition area on the first floor

08:39.400 --> 08:40.000
particularly interested in

08:40.280 --> 08:41.360
I would like to invite you to visit there

08:41.919 --> 08:42.360
Well

08:42.960 --> 08:43.760
Then let her

08:43.880 --> 08:44.760
Wait for me in the exhibition area

08:45.280 --> 08:45.920
I happened to be with her

08:46.000 --> 08:46.920
Give a good introduction

08:51.360 --> 08:51.960
how's it going

08:52.480 --> 08:53.240
It will take a while

08:54.840 --> 08:55.800
What about after you fix it?

08:56.040 --> 08:57.200
Turn off the computer for me

08:57.920 --> 08:58.640
close the door

08:59.360 --> 09:00.160
no problem

10:08.680 --> 10:09.880
It’s almost time today

10:11.400 --> 10:11.880
uncle

10:12.080 --> 10:13.080
And one last question

10:13.800 --> 10:15.320
Last question

10:15.680 --> 10:16.080
good

11:03.400 --> 11:03.840
Mr. Huang

11:04.360 --> 11:05.200
The computer has been repaired

11:36.960 --> 11:37.720
The data is all here

11:43.640 --> 11:44.720
Submit this one

11:45.080 --> 11:45.920
The data has been fine-tuned

11:47.280 --> 11:47.680
OK

12:08.560 --> 12:09.040
this is for you

12:11.440 --> 12:12.200
Well done

12:15.080 --> 12:16.160
When will the bonus be given to me?

12:17.880 --> 12:18.680
After inspection

12:19.640 --> 12:21.120
If not, how can you test it?

12:24.080 --> 12:24.720
Feeling guilty

12:27.840 --> 12:28.760
I have no guilty conscience

12:29.000 --> 12:29.960
I'm just afraid you'll default on your debt

12:32.360 --> 12:34.120
As long as you complete the task well

12:34.680 --> 12:35.880
I guarantee your income

12:36.600 --> 12:37.480
will soon exceed

12:37.560 --> 12:38.920
anyone around you

12:39.560 --> 12:40.920
I'm afraid that I have more money than them.

12:41.120 --> 12:42.080
Lifespan is shorter than theirs

12:43.520 --> 12:44.560
It's up to you

12:46.760 --> 12:47.600
Don't make arrangements for me recently

12:47.640 --> 12:48.320
What's the mission?

12:48.720 --> 12:49.720
I want to get familiar with the environment

12:50.120 --> 12:51.840
This will help me extend my life

12:53.400 --> 12:53.800
Walk

13:18.360 --> 13:19.080
Are you still worried?

13:22.400 --> 13:23.200
I just took a look

13:23.920 --> 13:25.080
Still didn’t pass review

13:25.760 --> 13:26.560
How can it be so fast?

13:27.600 --> 13:28.880
How will they review it?

13:32.000 --> 13:32.560
I don't know either

13:35.600 --> 13:36.080
you say

13:36.840 --> 13:38.040
will they

13:38.640 --> 13:39.600
The problem has been discovered

13:39.800 --> 13:41.600
Just stop being so guilty.

13:42.040 --> 13:43.280
I didn’t change it blindly.

13:43.720 --> 13:45.120
I am holding the previous data.

13:45.360 --> 13:46.240
fine-tuning

13:46.560 --> 13:47.720
They can't know

13:51.560 --> 13:52.240
unless

13:53.880 --> 13:54.360
Unless something

13:59.680 --> 14:00.120
you

14:01.320 --> 14:02.080
Suspect me

14:03.640 --> 14:04.360
You can't

14:05.320 --> 14:05.920
I swear

14:06.720 --> 14:07.600
I will never betray you

14:08.440 --> 14:09.120
Not now

14:09.840 --> 14:10.600
Not in the future

14:13.400 --> 14:14.000
I trust you

14:15.920 --> 14:16.840
You don't have to worry anymore

14:17.680 --> 14:18.520
As long as we don't say anything

14:18.800 --> 14:19.680
They can't know

14:21.960 --> 14:22.600
Don't worry

14:25.240 --> 14:26.520
Waiting for you to finish eating in a while

14:27.080 --> 14:28.480
Let's shift our attention

14:29.880 --> 14:30.880
take you to a place

14:31.240 --> 14:32.560
vent your anxiety

14:33.000 --> 14:33.400
where to

14:37.560 --> 14:40.480
Did you catch it?

14:40.760 --> 14:41.480
This one, this one

14:44.800 --> 14:45.360
Crooked

14:45.640 --> 14:46.560
Almost almost

14:47.080 --> 14:47.800
Come up, come up

14:49.280 --> 14:50.000
Ok, Ok

14:50.400 --> 14:50.760
good

15:01.480 --> 15:02.200
Another one comes out

15:06.000 --> 15:06.520
gave it to you

15:06.680 --> 15:07.280
Thanks

15:11.360 --> 15:12.400
come on! Come on

15:12.840 --> 15:13.280
come on

15:15.320 --> 15:16.040
A little closer

15:16.560 --> 15:17.440
You are so stupid

15:19.360 --> 15:20.600
This is okay, okay

15:20.720 --> 15:21.120
This is good

15:24.600 --> 15:25.280
I caught this

15:26.920 --> 15:28.120
come on! Come on

15:28.360 --> 15:30.520
come on, come on, come on

15:34.280 --> 15:34.960
five little dolls

15:35.080 --> 15:35.720
Get a bigger doll

15:35.800 --> 15:36.640
Which one is more cost-effective?

15:37.200 --> 15:38.400
It’s definitely a good deal for a big baby

15:39.080 --> 15:39.400
How about it

15:39.480 --> 15:40.560
I feel better now, right?

15:41.920 --> 15:42.600
Much more comfortable

15:43.160 --> 15:43.800
And today

15:43.920 --> 15:44.760
I caught more than you

15:45.240 --> 15:46.160
I caught these

15:46.640 --> 15:47.320
It sounds like

15:47.360 --> 15:48.480
When did I win over you?

15:48.880 --> 15:50.080
I appreciate you like this

15:50.320 --> 15:50.880
Ambitious

15:51.400 --> 15:52.120
surrender type

15:52.680 --> 15:53.640
What shall we play later?

15:54.600 --> 15:55.360
Wait a minute

15:56.720 --> 15:57.400
Go to the skating rink

15:57.600 --> 15:57.960
OK

15:58.480 --> 15:59.200
Then I've booked a ticket

16:30.280 --> 16:31.480
You weren't asleep at all, were you?

16:39.480 --> 16:41.360
I thought you were really not anxious

16:45.760 --> 16:47.400
I didn’t expect that we are evenly matched.

16:48.960 --> 16:49.880
What's going on between us?

16:50.000 --> 16:50.840
There has to be someone

16:51.000 --> 16:52.080
keep calm

16:52.960 --> 16:54.120
Otherwise everything will collapse

16:55.120 --> 16:56.400
I really don't like this feeling

16:57.440 --> 16:58.000
Might as well give it to me

16:58.000 --> 16:58.760
Let's have a good time

16:59.800 --> 17:00.680
Forget it

17:01.240 --> 17:02.040
Everything has been done

17:02.920 --> 17:03.720
Just leave it to fate

17:07.560 --> 17:08.200
What if

17:08.839 --> 17:09.839
There really will be a day

17:15.000 --> 17:16.319
Photos on Dr. Feng’s computer

17:16.440 --> 17:17.119
I stole it

17:17.920 --> 17:19.079
I also stole the documents in Macau.

17:19.960 --> 17:20.800
There are also those in Lao Huang’s computer

17:20.800 --> 17:21.440
that report

17:21.560 --> 17:22.200
I stole it all

17:23.200 --> 17:24.240
I'm in the middle

17:24.400 --> 17:25.400
What tricks did you do?

17:25.800 --> 17:26.680
you have no idea

17:27.079 --> 17:27.839
Spy asks you

17:28.000 --> 17:28.840
Just say that

17:29.480 --> 17:30.080
Remember?

17:34.480 --> 17:35.800
I'm worried about you

17:37.200 --> 17:37.960
Do not worry

17:38.600 --> 17:39.440
I have a big heart

17:39.920 --> 17:40.400
Fate is also great

17:41.080 --> 17:41.560
fine

17:45.200 --> 17:45.680
Go to sleep

18:07.680 --> 18:08.680
Documents handed over by Huang Zicheng

18:08.680 --> 18:09.320
has a problem

18:11.720 --> 18:12.760
some data

18:13.080 --> 18:13.840
Changed it for him

18:15.440 --> 18:16.480
Sure enough, he has a problem

18:21.880 --> 18:22.480
I originally thought

18:22.560 --> 18:23.960
Put him in the network department

18:24.040 --> 18:24.880
no need

18:25.920 --> 18:26.920
we have people there

18:28.040 --> 18:29.320
Putting one more is redundant

18:31.480 --> 18:32.200
Now it seems

18:32.360 --> 18:33.000
you are right

18:34.960 --> 18:36.120
Originally, Huang Zicheng

18:36.480 --> 18:37.160
Put it in the network department

18:37.280 --> 18:38.760
To find a scapegoat for him

18:39.720 --> 18:41.080
Just like Shi Lei and Yu Xiaoyue

18:42.440 --> 18:43.560
Once there is a problem

18:44.040 --> 18:45.040
Throw the chess piece

18:45.160 --> 18:45.960
Keep Huang Zicheng

18:47.320 --> 18:49.080
But after I met him in the bar

18:50.000 --> 18:51.080
I think it's not that simple

18:52.040 --> 18:52.560
so

18:53.120 --> 18:53.960
I give him a task

18:54.240 --> 18:55.120
Come and test the truth

18:56.960 --> 18:57.880
What do you think of Huang Zicheng?

18:57.920 --> 18:59.600
Doing such a small act without permission

19:00.600 --> 19:01.600
It's his personal behavior

19:03.120 --> 19:04.600
Or is there someone behind him?

19:06.240 --> 19:07.680
Contact Fang Lu

19:08.120 --> 19:09.280
Change data

19:10.320 --> 19:11.440
these behaviors

19:12.520 --> 19:14.480
It seems that the purpose is not simple.

19:15.440 --> 19:15.840
Then you doubt

19:15.960 --> 19:17.120
Instigated behind his back

19:18.040 --> 19:18.760
It's the National Security Agency

19:19.840 --> 19:20.760
It's possible

19:21.720 --> 19:22.320
What about Yao Yao?

19:23.560 --> 19:25.040
Did Yao Yao remind him?

19:26.480 --> 19:26.920
No

19:28.160 --> 19:29.560
I suggest starting with Yao Yao

19:30.600 --> 19:32.120
See how much she knows

19:36.160 --> 19:37.240
Huang Zicheng now

19:37.560 --> 19:39.120
Already a dangerous person

19:40.360 --> 19:41.640
Is the national security hidden behind him?

19:41.760 --> 19:42.520
Still unknown

19:44.240 --> 19:45.440
Before I figure it out

19:46.440 --> 19:47.480
Don't touch him first

19:48.600 --> 19:50.440
I will take care of Yao Yao's side.

19:52.360 --> 19:52.800
OK

19:55.680 --> 19:56.120
Just specialized

19:56.160 --> 19:56.960
is this your car

19:57.320 --> 19:57.600
this is mine

19:57.640 --> 19:58.320
this is yours

19:58.920 --> 19:59.560
Whose does this belong to?

19:59.920 --> 20:00.240
This is mine

20:00.400 --> 20:01.000
can i try

20:01.200 --> 20:01.480
sure

20:03.040 --> 20:04.000
let me try your car

20:06.320 --> 20:07.240
Are these two cars the same?

20:07.480 --> 20:08.320
These two cars are different

20:09.320 --> 20:09.680
Displacement is different

20:09.760 --> 20:10.200
What about that one?

20:10.760 --> 20:11.960
It's similar to that one

20:12.480 --> 20:13.440
Then these two are almost the same.

20:13.520 --> 20:13.840
right

20:13.920 --> 20:14.240
right

20:14.480 --> 20:15.800
But it was actually modified

20:15.880 --> 20:16.800
a little more than that

20:17.960 --> 20:19.280
Your car is so handsome

20:20.280 --> 20:20.720
Thanks

20:22.360 --> 20:23.400
Not bad, really handsome

20:25.480 --> 20:25.840
OK

20:26.800 --> 20:27.680
So let’s get here today

20:28.080 --> 20:28.920
Then I'll go back first

20:29.240 --> 20:30.200
Let's play again in two days

20:30.400 --> 20:30.760
OK

20:30.920 --> 20:31.280
Date again

20:31.560 --> 20:32.000
Bye bye

20:32.080 --> 20:32.560
Bye bye

20:35.320 --> 20:35.840
he's gone

20:37.960 --> 20:38.360
Hi-tech

20:39.000 --> 20:39.440
Hi-tech

20:48.680 --> 20:49.360
Pony follows up

20:50.000 --> 20:50.760
Technical subjects start

20:51.800 --> 20:52.520
Already started

20:56.440 --> 20:57.080
Everyone remember

20:57.600 --> 20:58.320
keep Calm

20:58.840 --> 20:59.720
Better to lose than to be violent

21:22.400 --> 21:22.960
I'm in place

21:25.840 --> 21:26.640
Take Kehua Middle Road

21:27.040 --> 21:27.680
parallel to him

21:44.240 --> 21:45.360
He entered Huainan North Road

21:50.640 --> 21:51.880
The target is at Huainan North Road

21:52.160 --> 21:52.480
Big Liu

21:52.680 --> 21:53.680
Follow him at the next intersection

21:54.840 --> 21:55.200
receive

22:22.960 --> 22:23.520
He stopped the car

22:23.600 --> 22:24.360
Entered a flower shop

22:24.560 --> 22:25.720
Don't stop and pass by

22:37.640 --> 22:38.240
hello sir

22:39.160 --> 22:39.840
what flowers do you want

22:41.240 --> 22:42.040
Give me a bouquet of roses

22:42.320 --> 22:43.000
Wait a moment

23:38.840 --> 23:40.360
He should arrive at his destination soon

24:06.960 --> 24:08.480
The suspect is at the gate of the high-speed rail group

24:08.520 --> 24:09.080
stopped

24:29.960 --> 24:30.640
Liu took over

24:30.840 --> 24:31.400
continue to follow

25:02.320 --> 25:03.680
Did you see the girl's face clearly?

25:05.040 --> 25:05.680
Can't see the face

25:44.760 --> 25:46.240
You first go to the 10th floor, Building 11, Area B

25:46.760 --> 25:48.240
Set the password to your birthday

25:48.720 --> 25:49.440
You go up first

25:49.880 --> 25:50.480
I'm going to park the car

25:57.840 --> 25:58.560
I'll follow up and have a look

25:58.800 --> 25:59.240
Stop following

26:00.880 --> 26:02.240
The girl is unidentified

26:02.600 --> 26:03.640
It's too risky to follow.

26:04.400 --> 26:05.040
Wait for her to come out

26:05.360 --> 26:05.680
good

26:38.640 --> 26:39.680
Hello, please come in

28:05.080 --> 28:05.880
Just ignore it

28:06.000 --> 28:06.800
Won't it burn?

28:07.680 --> 28:08.600
We just want its skin

28:08.680 --> 28:09.440
That layer of burnt

28:09.560 --> 28:10.640
That's called Mena's reaction

28:11.800 --> 28:13.560
I didn’t expect you to be so good at cooking

28:14.240 --> 28:15.200
I studied cooking in high school

28:15.680 --> 28:16.160
Really

28:18.160 --> 28:18.680
What are you doing?

28:18.680 --> 28:19.920
How many other things can you do?

28:19.960 --> 28:20.680
I do not know

28:25.080 --> 28:25.640
a lot of

28:31.880 --> 28:32.920
Do you really not care about it?

28:35.680 --> 28:36.240
It's time to turn over

28:41.920 --> 28:42.920
thanks for your dinnere

28:43.320 --> 28:43.960
delicious

28:44.520 --> 28:45.920
The red wine you chose is also great

28:58.960 --> 28:59.440
It's for you

29:00.880 --> 29:01.920
Why are there gifts?

29:04.360 --> 29:06.560
Today is an important day

29:08.000 --> 29:08.680
today

29:10.120 --> 29:11.000
do not you know

29:13.720 --> 29:14.720
Today is

29:16.080 --> 29:17.000
buckley galaxy

29:17.000 --> 29:18.560
1,350th anniversary of the explosion

29:18.560 --> 29:19.200
anniversary

29:22.400 --> 29:23.600
Come as soon as you open your mouth

29:24.960 --> 29:25.440
unimportant

29:25.640 --> 29:26.800
See if you like it

29:40.480 --> 29:41.360
Also round

29:46.520 --> 29:47.280
my name

29:47.960 --> 29:48.520
try

30:02.480 --> 30:02.960
How about it

30:10.240 --> 30:10.920
Got promoted

30:12.960 --> 30:13.720
Senior Assistant

30:14.360 --> 30:15.720
Isn't that still an assistant?

30:16.160 --> 30:16.760
But high-end

30:17.440 --> 30:18.560
We have to drink to this

30:27.920 --> 30:28.680
wish

30:29.560 --> 30:30.360
Happy promotion

30:31.600 --> 30:32.480
wish

30:32.720 --> 30:33.520
buckley galaxy

30:33.520 --> 30:35.320
1,350th anniversary of the explosion

30:36.800 --> 30:37.080
Can

30:45.280 --> 30:46.360
Let me give you a gift too

30:47.600 --> 30:48.320
I also have a gift

30:48.760 --> 30:48.960
come over

30:56.720 --> 30:57.280
receive

30:59.040 --> 31:00.680
You cook and I wash the dishes

31:01.120 --> 31:01.600
Reasonable

31:04.880 --> 31:05.520
Let's go together

31:09.200 --> 31:10.160
The sun is at the gate of the community

31:10.280 --> 31:11.560
The suspect has not been seen again.

31:11.800 --> 31:12.800
The girl never came out again

31:14.560 --> 31:15.880
Have you confirmed the girl's identity?

31:16.640 --> 31:17.760
I didn't see the girl's face clearly

31:17.920 --> 31:18.840
So there is nothing I can do to her

31:18.880 --> 31:19.920
for identification

31:20.560 --> 31:21.120
But that girl

31:21.240 --> 31:22.160
When I left the high-speed rail group

31:22.240 --> 31:23.040
Carrying a bag

31:23.280 --> 31:24.000
probably there

31:24.120 --> 31:24.800
employees

31:25.920 --> 31:26.920
Fang Yongping explained

31:27.200 --> 31:27.760
Ye Wu is watching

31:27.840 --> 31:28.840
High-speed rail group’s bid

31:29.240 --> 31:29.960
So their actions

31:30.040 --> 31:31.160
It's probably still going on

31:33.440 --> 31:34.080
Do it to them both

31:34.120 --> 31:35.200
24-hour monitoring

31:35.760 --> 31:36.840
Three groups take turns monitoring

31:38.280 --> 31:38.960
Be sure to make it clear

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
The identity of this girl

31:40.560 --> 31:40.880
clear

31:41.520 --> 31:42.120
If this girl

31:42.200 --> 31:42.800
work there

31:42.920 --> 31:43.880
It will definitely appear tomorrow

37:37.880 --> 37:39.120
She likes the gift you gave her

37:40.360 --> 37:41.400
I really like it

37:42.120 --> 37:43.120
Still pretending to like it

37:45.080 --> 37:45.600
unimportant

37:46.880 --> 37:48.360
The most important thing is to successfully complete the task

37:50.920 --> 37:51.400
Do not worry

37:56.000 --> 37:57.600
Time flies so fast

37:59.880 --> 38:01.520
This is our partnership

38:02.560 --> 38:03.760
What year is it?

38:09.840 --> 38:10.480
more than three years

38:52.480 --> 38:52.920
Boss Zhang

38:57.440 --> 38:58.480
from now on

38:58.880 --> 39:00.200
I am your wife

39:03.080 --> 39:03.760
How long

39:04.640 --> 39:05.640
Listen to the organization's arrangements

39:06.960 --> 39:07.440
Can

39:08.400 --> 39:09.800
Couple I haven’t seen for a long time

39:09.880 --> 39:11.160
Should I be more enthusiastic?

39:14.320 --> 39:15.480
Let's take you home

39:21.000 --> 39:21.440
Gift

39:27.080 --> 39:27.840
Very considerate

39:46.480 --> 39:47.320
Sorry, I am late

39:47.360 --> 39:47.920
It doesn't matter

39:50.000 --> 39:50.920
Sir, your wine

39:51.480 --> 39:51.960
Thanks

39:52.040 --> 39:52.520
thanks, thanks

39:53.240 --> 39:53.840
Very good

39:55.240 --> 39:55.600
cheers

39:55.720 --> 39:56.160
cheers

42:00.120 --> 42:01.400
Nothing good will happen to you when you come here

42:03.600 --> 42:04.720
Good news for you

42:05.920 --> 42:06.560
Your task here

42:06.680 --> 42:07.520
It has ended

42:09.160 --> 42:09.720
what's next

42:11.440 --> 42:11.960
You guys will go to one

42:11.960 --> 42:12.960
very beautiful place

42:13.960 --> 42:14.960
China Tsukai

42:15.480 --> 42:16.080
long-term latent

42:17.160 --> 42:18.000
Taking over on behalf of the organization

42:18.040 --> 42:18.920
Jinhai affairs

42:21.800 --> 42:23.200
So are we still husband and wife?

42:24.240 --> 42:24.760
No

42:26.000 --> 42:27.200
You will have your own tasks

42:32.080 --> 42:32.800
Divorced

42:35.280 --> 42:35.960
Single

42:44.240 --> 42:44.840
Happy three years
