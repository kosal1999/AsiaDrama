01:58.200 --> 01:59.039
I know it all

02:21.760 --> 02:22.760
Do they really trust you?

02:26.400 --> 02:26.920
That's good

02:27.800 --> 02:28.400
can say that

02:28.480 --> 02:30.040
My prison meals these days have not been in vain.

02:33.480 --> 02:34.000
I feel wronged to you

02:34.600 --> 02:35.200
Not wronged

02:36.079 --> 02:36.720
I found it

02:37.079 --> 02:37.880
I am now

02:38.000 --> 02:39.040
Just professional cannon fodder

02:39.800 --> 02:40.480
but

02:41.000 --> 02:42.120
I'm really happy this time

02:42.520 --> 02:43.920
As long as you can successfully land

02:44.200 --> 02:45.880
It's worth it even if I'm broken to pieces

02:49.079 --> 02:49.680
Zicheng

02:50.640 --> 02:51.360
Thank you

02:53.000 --> 02:54.360
Why are you so polite to me?

02:58.920 --> 03:00.040
Have we been there for a long time?

03:00.200 --> 03:01.080
nothing like now

03:01.120 --> 03:02.000
Stay together

03:03.120 --> 03:03.720
yes

03:04.480 --> 03:05.160
but

03:05.800 --> 03:06.560
This thing

03:06.760 --> 03:07.960
Getting better little by little

03:08.720 --> 03:09.360
Later

03:09.840 --> 03:11.000
the time we spend together

03:11.240 --> 03:12.000
there will be many

03:15.520 --> 03:16.200
But

03:19.000 --> 03:20.280
But I'm leaving Jinhai

03:22.000 --> 03:22.680
where to

03:26.120 --> 03:26.920
As soon as Zhou Zhe transferred me,

03:27.079 --> 03:28.840
The operating company of Agent Game

03:29.720 --> 03:30.840
Make me the game director

03:32.280 --> 03:33.079
so suddenly

03:36.400 --> 03:37.880
If you want to get his evidence

03:38.640 --> 03:39.520
this is an opportunity

03:42.079 --> 03:42.600
no

03:43.040 --> 03:43.640
you can't go

03:44.000 --> 03:44.840
Too dangerous

03:46.000 --> 03:47.360
Didn’t you just say that?

03:48.200 --> 03:48.760
this could be me

03:48.960 --> 03:50.040
Last chance to go ashore

03:50.760 --> 03:52.120
It's worth it to be broken into pieces

03:54.800 --> 03:55.320
That

03:56.520 --> 03:57.520
Have you thought it through?

04:04.520 --> 04:05.240
Think it through

04:08.080 --> 04:08.720
That

04:15.520 --> 04:16.640
will you go with me

04:18.200 --> 04:18.800
I

04:21.079 --> 04:22.560
Do you need me to go with you?

04:26.360 --> 04:27.000
I'm teasing you

04:27.200 --> 04:28.080
Are you kidding me?

04:29.120 --> 04:29.720
this is myself

04:29.920 --> 04:31.040
Things that need to be faced

04:31.760 --> 04:32.760
It has nothing to do with you

04:40.320 --> 04:40.960
I go

04:44.920 --> 04:45.600
Yao Yao

04:46.840 --> 04:47.600
What about you?

04:48.040 --> 04:48.880
When you lie

04:49.440 --> 04:51.040
I just like to pick my fingernails

04:52.680 --> 04:53.720
You must pay attention to this

04:54.720 --> 04:55.680
any detail

04:56.320 --> 04:57.320
will betray you

04:59.880 --> 05:00.960
You won't do it for no reason

05:01.040 --> 05:02.120
Tell me to accompany you

05:02.120 --> 05:03.280
If we go together

05:03.960 --> 05:05.280
If I guess correctly

05:06.400 --> 05:06.960
i should be you

05:07.120 --> 05:08.080
Go back as a bargaining chip

05:12.120 --> 05:13.400
Can they offer such conditions?

05:14.240 --> 05:14.880
Just show

05:15.440 --> 05:16.720
They don't fully trust you yet

05:18.360 --> 05:18.920
I went

05:19.400 --> 05:20.880
Can help you gain their trust

05:25.680 --> 05:26.240
But you know it

05:26.480 --> 05:27.320
this is a trap

05:27.800 --> 05:29.160
If you go there, you'll be free to eat mermaid meat.

05:30.320 --> 05:31.320
If I don't go

05:31.960 --> 05:32.640
The man who lets people eat meat

05:32.800 --> 05:33.560
it's you

05:48.560 --> 05:49.320
Yewu has already agreed

05:49.520 --> 05:50.080
my request

05:50.640 --> 05:52.640
After getting the HY106 data

05:53.120 --> 05:53.800
Arrange for me and Boss Zhang

05:54.000 --> 05:54.640
leave together

05:55.320 --> 05:56.040
leave

05:57.600 --> 05:57.920
I thought

05:57.920 --> 05:59.040
You just go through Boss Zhang

05:59.320 --> 06:00.960
Come and investigate the secrets hidden in Jinhai

06:01.160 --> 06:01.600
spy network

06:01.760 --> 06:02.560
why do you want to leave

06:03.400 --> 06:03.960
The night fog is now

06:04.120 --> 06:04.960
Starting to doubt me

06:06.680 --> 06:07.240
let me risk

06:07.440 --> 06:08.560
Take this experimental data

06:08.920 --> 06:09.520
obviously not them

06:09.680 --> 06:10.480
best choice

06:11.280 --> 06:11.720
I do not have either

06:11.880 --> 06:12.760
One hundred percent sure

06:13.640 --> 06:14.760
But they still let me do it

06:16.080 --> 06:17.080
Then they still have a backup plan

06:19.600 --> 06:20.280
In the hands of Boss Zhang

06:20.480 --> 06:21.240
One more trump card

06:22.440 --> 06:23.720
Just inside the Bio Group

06:24.240 --> 06:25.960
His actions are more reliable

06:27.480 --> 06:28.160
so let you go

06:28.360 --> 06:29.480
It's their usual trick

06:30.440 --> 06:31.880
The plank road was repaired in the open, but Chencang was buried in the dark

06:32.400 --> 06:33.040
That's right

06:53.800 --> 06:54.280
Thanks

07:01.440 --> 07:02.360
You go to Yewu to work as an undercover agent

07:02.520 --> 07:03.480
It's impossible

07:06.720 --> 07:07.320
why

07:08.960 --> 07:09.680
You are a national security officer

07:09.880 --> 07:11.440
How can they trust you?

07:12.800 --> 07:13.560
You are the biggest to them

07:13.800 --> 07:14.480
Utilization value

07:15.040 --> 07:16.320
That means you stay in the National Security Bureau

07:17.280 --> 07:17.920
once you leave

07:17.920 --> 07:19.080
You have no value anymore

07:19.080 --> 07:20.520
How could they take you in?

07:21.600 --> 07:22.880
It's too risky for you to do this

07:26.160 --> 07:27.000
you have a point

07:28.960 --> 07:29.840
But for the mission

07:30.720 --> 07:31.560
i must take risk

07:34.600 --> 07:35.680
No, I have to talk to him.

07:36.360 --> 07:38.000
Don't make trouble for others

07:39.520 --> 07:40.920
Can you believe me once?

07:44.520 --> 07:45.920
I can't die

07:51.840 --> 07:53.520
Look, are you sad now?

08:06.400 --> 08:07.080
what is this

08:09.600 --> 08:10.880
These were all given by Zicheng

08:15.560 --> 08:16.160
Look like

08:19.040 --> 08:19.680
unlike

08:25.160 --> 08:25.760
these things

08:25.800 --> 08:27.120
Just help me keep it safe first.

08:31.680 --> 08:32.320
OK

08:34.400 --> 08:35.080
I'm waiting for you to come back

08:36.480 --> 08:37.080
Give it back to you

08:39.200 --> 08:39.960
Thank you, Officer Wu

08:40.919 --> 08:41.520
You're welcome

08:41.840 --> 08:42.480
Section Chief Gao

09:22.920 --> 09:23.880
I don't even remember

09:24.120 --> 09:24.840
Last time I came to the beach

09:24.840 --> 09:25.600
when is it

09:26.920 --> 09:28.040
Often things around us

09:28.200 --> 09:29.160
Most easily ignored

09:33.280 --> 09:34.120
you have to do me a favor

09:41.080 --> 09:41.640
What are you busy with?

09:43.400 --> 09:44.080
i need one

09:44.280 --> 09:45.920
The latest HY106 data

09:50.520 --> 09:51.240
Ye Wu asked you to do it

09:53.760 --> 09:54.600
Finish this time

09:55.000 --> 09:56.040
I'm ready to leave

09:58.440 --> 09:59.280
where to

10:03.360 --> 10:04.000
have no idea

10:05.400 --> 10:06.400
I'm leaving anyway

10:11.720 --> 10:12.440
I also decided

10:14.040 --> 10:14.840
I'm going with Yao Yao

10:17.280 --> 10:17.880
Zicheng

10:18.680 --> 10:20.160
You don't have to go with me

10:21.800 --> 10:22.280
you don't want

10:22.280 --> 10:23.120
Shall I go with you?

10:24.640 --> 10:25.560
this is too dangerous

10:26.360 --> 10:27.480
Isn't it dangerous for you to go?

10:28.960 --> 10:29.520
Do not worry

10:30.040 --> 10:31.360
I am now a professional cannon fodder

10:32.120 --> 10:32.760
if i don't leave

10:33.240 --> 10:34.200
They won't trust you either

10:35.120 --> 10:35.600
Is it right

10:53.760 --> 10:54.800
So comfortable

10:59.320 --> 11:00.080
do you remember

11:00.560 --> 11:01.320
When we were kids

11:01.360 --> 11:02.920
This is my favorite time to go swimming

11:04.560 --> 11:05.800
I can also go into the water now

11:10.360 --> 11:11.360
Do you really want to do it?

11:17.040 --> 11:17.560
Leave him

11:18.040 --> 11:18.640
He's like that

11:19.240 --> 11:20.440
Do whatever comes to mind

11:33.600 --> 11:34.160
Brother Tianyang

11:35.080 --> 11:35.520
really want him

11:35.680 --> 11:36.680
come with me

11:38.760 --> 11:39.480
if he doesn't go

11:40.200 --> 11:41.600
All efforts are wasted

11:44.360 --> 11:45.360
really dangerous

11:48.200 --> 11:48.920
when necessary

11:49.600 --> 11:50.520
It requires sacrifice

11:51.560 --> 11:52.760
But that's your brother

11:53.560 --> 11:54.440
this is the struggle

11:56.200 --> 11:57.360
Now that you have chosen to join

11:57.880 --> 11:59.160
That requires wisdom and courage

11:59.320 --> 11:59.920
to fight

12:00.760 --> 12:01.800
rather than shrinking back

12:06.320 --> 12:06.920
Do not worry

12:08.240 --> 12:09.800
Someone will be responsible for his safety

12:15.360 --> 12:15.880
come

12:16.800 --> 12:17.840
Come on, Gao Tianyang

12:19.200 --> 12:19.960
come

12:21.640 --> 12:22.200
Coming

12:38.160 --> 12:38.840
Come down and play for a while

12:42.600 --> 12:43.120
Coming

14:32.080 --> 14:32.640
It’s time to eat

14:35.160 --> 14:36.200
It’s time to eat, it’s time to eat

15:36.320 --> 15:37.280
No rest at noon

15:38.600 --> 15:39.320
Is it noon?

15:40.120 --> 15:41.320
It's almost half past twelve

15:41.920 --> 15:43.280
You said you, old comrade

15:43.320 --> 15:44.840
We can’t just focus on construction.

15:45.040 --> 15:46.000
You also have to pay attention to your health

15:47.320 --> 15:48.640
There is another meeting in the afternoon

15:49.320 --> 15:50.080
No meal at noon

15:50.520 --> 15:51.120
eat

15:51.680 --> 15:52.680
Xiao Liu went to buy it

15:53.320 --> 15:53.880
Fine

15:53.960 --> 15:54.680
Then I won't bother you

15:54.680 --> 15:55.320
The leader is working

15:55.760 --> 15:56.920
I'll call my brother back tonight

15:57.120 --> 15:58.000
Let's have a meal together

15:58.320 --> 15:59.000
OK

15:59.880 --> 16:01.240
Fortunately, I have nothing to do in the afternoon

16:01.480 --> 16:02.240
What to eat

16:02.600 --> 16:03.840
I'll go buy it in advance in the afternoon

16:04.960 --> 16:05.800
Don't worry about it

16:06.200 --> 16:07.320
The two of us will do it for you

16:07.720 --> 16:08.840
I will honor and honor you well.

16:10.160 --> 16:12.040
I feel like this attitude is not quite right.

16:12.560 --> 16:14.160
I thought you came to me

16:14.760 --> 16:16.520
Is there some bad news to announce?

16:16.680 --> 16:17.320
or

16:17.720 --> 16:19.040
Just come to borrow money from me

16:20.680 --> 16:21.440
Why am I in your heart

16:21.640 --> 16:23.440
This image is so unbearable

16:24.320 --> 16:25.600
Anyway, if you

16:25.680 --> 16:27.320
If you really want to help me

16:27.560 --> 16:28.600
Then I won’t refuse

16:29.320 --> 16:30.880
You boy, you

16:41.240 --> 16:43.040
You two are Lao Huang's sons, right?

16:45.040 --> 16:46.400
When I was a kid, I followed behind

16:46.760 --> 16:48.200
It's so big now

17:01.680 --> 17:03.760
Okay, it looks good.

17:04.680 --> 17:05.400
When I said frying fish

17:05.480 --> 17:06.319
You have to watch it carefully

17:06.520 --> 17:07.800
Don't burn it, I tell you

17:08.480 --> 17:09.680
If you can do it, come

17:10.040 --> 17:10.960
That's not okay

17:11.200 --> 17:12.560
Today we agreed that you two will do it

17:12.760 --> 17:13.760
I eat ready-made

17:34.040 --> 17:34.760
brother

17:35.440 --> 17:36.040
Look at my fish

17:36.040 --> 17:37.120
Isn't it a bit too much?

17:41.800 --> 17:42.400
uncle

17:42.520 --> 17:43.600
Come, come, come and see

17:43.840 --> 17:45.120
Zicheng’s fried fish is so awesome

17:45.320 --> 17:45.920
Come on come on

17:46.160 --> 17:47.120
Why is it so delicious?

17:47.240 --> 17:48.840
It won’t burn after it’s fried.

17:50.640 --> 17:51.920
What did I just say?

17:52.080 --> 17:52.720
Mixed up like this

17:52.800 --> 17:53.640
How can we still eat it, you say?

17:53.640 --> 17:54.000
never mind

17:54.000 --> 17:54.600
The pan is sticky

17:54.920 --> 17:55.800
We can go out to eat

17:56.560 --> 17:57.240
Go out to eat

17:57.880 --> 17:58.560
What time is it?

17:58.920 --> 18:00.080
There are queues everywhere now

18:00.120 --> 18:01.080
Wait until he doesn't starve to death

18:01.680 --> 18:02.680
Don't, don't, don't worry

18:02.680 --> 18:03.160
I think of a way

18:03.160 --> 18:04.160
Think of a way, think of a way

18:04.760 --> 18:06.080
Isn’t this dish a good cut?

18:06.240 --> 18:07.360
Then eat hot pot instead and that's it.

18:08.960 --> 18:10.440
high high

18:11.200 --> 18:12.160
come on! Come on

18:15.160 --> 18:17.160
come on, come on, come on

18:18.840 --> 18:20.040
Gao Tianyang Gao Tianyang

18:20.360 --> 18:21.800
Always the last one

18:22.040 --> 18:22.920
How about it

18:23.560 --> 18:24.640
Accept or not

18:27.800 --> 18:28.720
I said you didn't mean it

18:28.920 --> 18:29.640
Give me some water

18:29.880 --> 18:30.640
No, no, no

18:30.840 --> 18:31.640
Not this time, really not this time

18:32.520 --> 18:33.240
The sword is not old yet

18:34.440 --> 18:36.360
Invincibility is so lonely

18:38.320 --> 18:39.280
You are still a master

18:39.280 --> 18:40.320
Even I can't play it

18:40.640 --> 18:41.560
He just has good hands

18:42.960 --> 18:43.600
drink drink drink

18:43.640 --> 18:44.280
Come, come, have a drink

18:44.520 --> 18:45.200
A cup of honor yellow

18:48.200 --> 18:48.920
do it again do it again do it again

18:48.920 --> 18:49.720
One more round, come on, come on

18:51.160 --> 18:52.160
Uncle, let’s go first

18:52.800 --> 18:53.760
Slow down on the road

18:54.560 --> 18:55.680
Go back and rest early

18:58.200 --> 18:59.280
What's going on? This is

19:03.720 --> 19:04.800
You also give Lao Huang a hug

19:07.200 --> 19:08.520
What's going on today?

19:09.560 --> 19:11.360
It's like a farewell ceremony

19:12.600 --> 19:13.280
This hug

19:13.720 --> 19:15.320
It’s etiquette between normal people

19:15.560 --> 19:16.120
Later

19:16.320 --> 19:17.360
We have to be normal too

19:17.920 --> 19:19.400
Okay, okay, you have many tricks

19:19.720 --> 19:20.240
let's go

19:20.840 --> 19:21.200
You go back

19:21.200 --> 19:21.600
You go quickly

19:21.680 --> 19:22.000
OK OK OK

19:22.000 --> 19:22.800
I won’t send it to you anymore

19:23.720 --> 19:24.400
Take care of yourself

19:36.560 --> 19:37.080
Where are you going?

19:37.720 --> 19:38.400
Go to Yao Yao's place

19:40.000 --> 19:40.520
action tomorrow

19:40.640 --> 19:41.720
Nothing can go wrong

19:42.560 --> 19:43.480
Someone will be watching us

19:45.240 --> 19:45.880
clear

20:01.080 --> 20:02.080
Came back so early

20:03.240 --> 20:04.200
I've just finished eating

20:05.840 --> 20:06.400
What do you want to eat

20:06.840 --> 20:07.440
I'll do it for you

20:10.560 --> 20:11.080
No

20:18.200 --> 20:19.120
when to act

20:20.400 --> 20:20.840
tomorrow

20:22.560 --> 20:23.280
so fast

20:24.600 --> 20:25.880
I'm really reluctant to give up

20:33.080 --> 20:34.280
I will leave with you

20:35.880 --> 20:37.400
Mr. Yu and I have finished talking.

20:38.000 --> 20:38.840
Have you considered

20:40.240 --> 20:40.680
What

20:42.880 --> 20:43.880
After going abroad

20:44.480 --> 20:45.160
What do you want to do

20:49.280 --> 20:50.480
what do you think i can do

20:51.400 --> 20:52.080
be my partner

20:54.120 --> 20:54.880
I don't want to be

20:55.000 --> 20:55.840
Another Xiao Yi

20:57.560 --> 20:58.200
Will not

20:59.080 --> 21:00.000
you are so smart

21:02.240 --> 21:02.760
Yes

21:04.240 --> 21:05.600
I can play the spy game

21:06.520 --> 21:07.280
I heard about that game

21:07.320 --> 21:08.040
Especially profitable

21:10.360 --> 21:11.600
you don't need to play games

21:14.640 --> 21:15.400
you are already one

21:15.400 --> 21:16.520
Very good agent

21:17.280 --> 21:18.760
There will be many companies hiring you

21:21.280 --> 21:22.800
Do you think Ye Wu can take me in?

21:24.640 --> 21:25.480
Who knows

21:26.440 --> 21:27.640
Let’s talk about it after we get out.

21:31.000 --> 21:31.920
You should pack your things first

21:32.360 --> 21:33.520
Don't wait for me at home tomorrow

21:34.520 --> 21:35.160
Why

21:36.280 --> 21:37.920
Tomorrow's action is an adventure

21:38.920 --> 21:39.920
If I'm going to get caught

21:40.240 --> 21:41.160
Just escape by yourself

21:45.200 --> 21:46.000
you were caught

21:47.200 --> 21:49.120
If I confess, I can be imprisoned for a few years less

21:51.080 --> 21:52.120
Pointless

21:54.600 --> 21:56.440
To me it's do or die

21:57.040 --> 21:57.760
no retreat

22:03.000 --> 22:03.800
Don't be too nice to me

22:04.480 --> 22:05.440
i will disappoint you

22:07.080 --> 22:07.760
I didn't expect it

22:07.960 --> 22:08.800
what can you give me

22:10.240 --> 22:11.040
That's good

22:15.440 --> 22:16.800
can i ask a personal question

22:18.960 --> 22:19.520
What

22:20.360 --> 22:21.240
do you have a family

22:34.800 --> 22:35.760
I only have myself

22:39.600 --> 22:41.120
This is the emotional bond we have in this business

22:41.760 --> 22:42.960
Will mislead my judgment

22:45.360 --> 22:46.400
Then why did you choose one?

22:46.520 --> 22:47.640
Such a difficult road

22:49.600 --> 22:50.920
Then why do you want to be a national security officer?

22:51.760 --> 22:52.600
avoiding problem

22:55.440 --> 22:56.360
Tell me first

22:57.160 --> 22:58.080
let me think

22:58.640 --> 23:00.080
Do you want to answer your question?

23:05.280 --> 23:05.960
university graduate

23:06.800 --> 23:07.400
Apply for national security

23:08.240 --> 23:08.800
Passed the training

23:09.160 --> 23:09.800
Then take up the job

23:10.720 --> 23:11.400
It's that simple

23:11.880 --> 23:12.600
I don't want to know

23:12.680 --> 23:13.840
Guoan recruitment process

23:14.800 --> 23:15.480
What I'm asking is

23:15.960 --> 23:16.880
Why are you

23:17.640 --> 23:18.520
To be a national security officer

23:29.480 --> 23:31.000
My parents were in a fire

23:32.160 --> 23:32.920
died accidentally

23:35.480 --> 23:36.320
And that accident

23:38.680 --> 23:39.320
that's because

23:39.520 --> 23:40.720
Caused by spies stealing secrets

23:45.200 --> 23:46.480
I thought I was going to hear a

23:46.480 --> 23:47.280
How ambitious

23:47.440 --> 23:48.560
and pursuit story

23:50.720 --> 23:51.880
Unexpectedly, it was also hatred

23:52.760 --> 23:53.760
This is not revenge

23:56.840 --> 23:58.000
The person who died is no longer there

23:59.440 --> 24:00.320
but living people

24:01.560 --> 24:02.520
I must protect

24:09.760 --> 24:10.360
I'm done

24:12.120 --> 24:13.360
Are you satisfied with my answer?

24:23.440 --> 24:24.400
When I was young

24:26.360 --> 24:27.400
Maybe worse than you

24:28.200 --> 24:29.400
little mute

24:29.480 --> 24:30.440
Come this way

24:31.000 --> 24:32.680
little mute

24:32.960 --> 24:34.600
Look at the children in our courtyard

24:34.600 --> 24:35.600
They're all down there

24:36.760 --> 24:38.240
little mute

24:38.240 --> 24:39.480
Then I'll go and get busy first.

24:39.920 --> 24:44.320
If you don’t cry or make trouble, you’re a fool

24:44.320 --> 24:45.080
cry

24:46.720 --> 24:48.640
little mute

24:49.160 --> 24:49.920
Really annoying

24:50.320 --> 24:51.600
little mute

24:51.920 --> 24:54.600
little mute

24:54.960 --> 24:57.080
Don't cry or make trouble

25:05.400 --> 25:06.000
know why

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
will i choose you

25:12.080 --> 25:13.240
Because there is hatred in your eyes

25:18.840 --> 25:19.800
like now

25:21.200 --> 25:22.240
Even in desperate situation

25:23.800 --> 25:25.080
Still want to bite the enemy back?

25:28.360 --> 25:29.280
Although your eyes are good

25:31.040 --> 25:31.720
but sometimes

25:31.720 --> 25:32.880
An act of overestimation

25:33.360 --> 25:34.360
It will make you suffer

25:39.040 --> 25:39.880
Do you still hate them?

25:43.680 --> 25:44.880
Remember this feeling

25:46.160 --> 25:46.720
hatred

25:48.000 --> 25:49.720
Sometimes it makes people stronger

25:53.400 --> 25:54.040
don't ask me

25:54.160 --> 25:55.200
will i take you somewhere

25:59.120 --> 25:59.760
where to

26:00.440 --> 26:01.680
It's better than here now

26:09.840 --> 26:11.440
You will live here from now on

26:12.400 --> 26:13.480
Get along well with everyone

27:04.080 --> 27:04.760
What are you doing

27:05.160 --> 27:05.680
release

27:22.560 --> 27:23.200
Okay, okay, okay

27:23.640 --> 27:24.360
let go

27:26.440 --> 27:27.120
Let go

27:28.040 --> 27:28.720
Excuting an order

27:33.920 --> 27:34.480
don't want

27:34.920 --> 27:37.360
Don't don't

27:40.040 --> 27:41.360
Where are you taking her?

27:41.840 --> 27:42.600
accept punishment

27:44.320 --> 27:45.880
She needs to calm down and think carefully

27:46.200 --> 27:47.360
Why did she lose?

28:00.280 --> 28:01.880
Do you want to have a fight too?

28:03.200 --> 28:04.880
One is eliminated every week

28:05.720 --> 28:06.360
new ones coming in

28:06.840 --> 28:08.120
Replace the one who was eliminated

28:12.520 --> 28:13.840
I don't want to be eliminated

28:15.440 --> 28:16.080
I don't want to either

28:24.400 --> 28:25.520
I didn't know until later

28:26.400 --> 28:27.160
that place

28:28.320 --> 28:29.720
It's a spy school, right?

28:31.920 --> 28:32.760
They recruit from all over

28:32.960 --> 28:33.800
Children of school age

28:34.560 --> 28:36.480
Raised since childhood, systematic training

28:37.200 --> 28:37.840
Then

28:38.360 --> 28:39.720
and then transported to various countries

28:40.160 --> 28:41.400
Become a real spy

28:43.520 --> 28:44.400
what you just said

28:44.840 --> 28:45.680
Is it training?

28:47.800 --> 28:48.840
almost every week

28:50.920 --> 28:52.320
People keep being sent away

28:53.640 --> 28:55.160
Someone will disappear suddenly

28:56.680 --> 28:58.360
Some people can't stand the torture

28:59.080 --> 28:59.880
suicide

29:01.960 --> 29:02.440
But soon

29:02.640 --> 29:03.280
There will be new children

29:03.520 --> 29:04.480
fill in

29:05.640 --> 29:06.320
cruel

29:07.000 --> 29:07.640
indifferent

29:08.360 --> 29:09.040
ruthless

29:09.920 --> 29:10.880
Mission first

29:14.320 --> 29:15.800
through training one at a time

29:16.720 --> 29:18.840
Kill all normal emotions

29:19.600 --> 29:20.600
Leave only what is needed

29:26.160 --> 29:26.920
But it's okay

29:27.880 --> 29:29.360
I made at least one friend

29:30.840 --> 29:31.760
only friend

29:32.960 --> 29:33.920
that boy

29:34.920 --> 29:36.080
It's Ran Fei, right?

29:41.040 --> 29:42.040
So you are so sure

29:42.560 --> 29:43.640
He won't betray me

29:45.560 --> 29:46.280
You believe it

29:50.800 --> 29:51.920
No, Section Chief Gao

29:53.000 --> 29:54.080
Such a vulgar story

29:54.680 --> 29:55.360
You believe it too

29:56.480 --> 29:58.120
I just like clichéd stories

30:00.440 --> 30:01.240
Is there any follow-up?

30:02.520 --> 30:03.840
story without ending

30:04.560 --> 30:05.480
That's the most perfect

30:09.640 --> 30:10.880
According to your story

30:12.120 --> 30:12.880
I won't be

30:13.000 --> 30:14.320
Be the next one to be eliminated

30:15.440 --> 30:16.880
As long as one person is still valuable

30:17.360 --> 30:18.440
won't be eliminated

30:21.320 --> 30:22.360
It seems I still have value

30:23.240 --> 30:24.000
certainly

30:27.200 --> 30:28.080
So keep it

30:28.200 --> 30:29.320
own value

30:30.440 --> 30:31.400
Don't do stupid things

30:43.320 --> 30:44.000
You do it

30:44.320 --> 30:45.040
Look at me

30:48.160 --> 30:48.720
what does it feel like

30:52.200 --> 30:53.080
It's like a lifetime ago

30:59.840 --> 31:00.560
Zicheng

31:01.800 --> 31:03.120
I think you should stay

31:04.120 --> 31:04.920
Have you ever thought about it

31:05.960 --> 31:06.880
If Brother Tianyang goes

31:07.040 --> 31:07.800
You went too

31:08.520 --> 31:09.600
What about uncle?

31:10.480 --> 31:12.240
It’s not like I won’t come back if I go.

31:14.080 --> 31:14.960
But even I went

31:15.160 --> 31:16.560
Don't even know what to face

31:16.880 --> 31:17.920
What's more, it's you

31:18.360 --> 31:19.080
so

31:19.320 --> 31:20.600
That makes it even more necessary for me to go

31:20.880 --> 31:21.880
I have to protect you

31:22.240 --> 31:23.040
Protect

31:23.640 --> 31:24.760
How do you protect me?

31:26.440 --> 31:27.800
The two of us were alone there

31:28.080 --> 31:28.560
What we have to face is

31:28.760 --> 31:29.800
entire espionage organization

31:30.160 --> 31:31.160
You can't even protect yourself

31:31.360 --> 31:32.800
What are you doing to protect me?

31:35.880 --> 31:36.400
Huang Zicheng

31:36.480 --> 31:37.520
you will always be like this

31:38.040 --> 31:39.040
feel good about yourself

31:39.560 --> 31:40.480
But you never know

31:40.680 --> 31:41.200
after you pass

31:41.400 --> 31:43.200
What dangers will you face?

31:43.960 --> 31:44.680
Yao Yao

31:45.400 --> 31:47.080
It's not like I haven't experienced it before

31:47.440 --> 31:47.960
Wouldn't they take me too?

31:48.160 --> 31:49.040
Nothing wrong?

32:00.040 --> 32:01.320
I know you are comforting me

32:03.480 --> 32:04.960
But now that you've escaped

32:05.640 --> 32:07.040
Just don't get involved anymore, okay?

32:08.160 --> 32:09.000
So I can't let you

32:09.160 --> 32:10.080
Go alone

32:11.680 --> 32:12.520
if you can

32:13.280 --> 32:14.160
someone i'd rather go to

32:14.520 --> 32:15.280
it's me

32:23.840 --> 32:25.200
It's all doomed

32:27.320 --> 32:29.360
Now things have developed like this

32:30.240 --> 32:31.880
Brother Tianyang and I must leave

32:33.680 --> 32:34.600
But you are different

32:36.080 --> 32:37.000
You still have a home

32:38.280 --> 32:39.200
And uncle

32:41.760 --> 32:43.320
You can still stay in Jinhai

32:43.640 --> 32:44.600
fulfill your dream

32:48.640 --> 32:49.600
If you have a chance

32:52.600 --> 32:53.440
we can meet again

32:54.200 --> 32:54.960
No but me

32:54.960 --> 32:55.600
Stop talking

32:57.880 --> 32:58.760
Listen to me this time

33:00.720 --> 33:01.840
Just let me beg you, okay?

33:06.000 --> 33:06.560
OK

33:07.640 --> 33:08.840
the time we can stay together

33:09.000 --> 33:09.560
Running out

33:09.920 --> 33:11.360
Don't waste this time anymore

33:12.160 --> 33:12.840
in some unnecessary

33:13.040 --> 33:13.960
Things are over

33:41.560 --> 33:42.480
We've been together for so long

33:43.360 --> 33:43.840
Not one yet

33:44.000 --> 33:44.920
What about the official group photo?

33:47.320 --> 33:47.920
Yes

33:49.280 --> 33:50.280
But it's so late

33:50.680 --> 33:51.720
No place to take pictures

33:53.800 --> 33:54.600
Not always

34:09.080 --> 34:09.800
look

34:21.639 --> 34:22.159
look

34:23.000 --> 34:23.760
Where are you going?

34:39.800 --> 34:40.400
there

34:43.080 --> 34:43.719
Zicheng

34:44.400 --> 34:45.480
Where are you taking me?

34:46.560 --> 34:47.679
let's get married

34:51.239 --> 34:52.040
Right here

34:52.560 --> 34:53.600
What are you going to do?

34:54.760 --> 34:55.320
Come

34:58.160 --> 34:58.960
Wait for me here

35:35.560 --> 35:36.160
this this

35:36.280 --> 35:37.040
Am I wearing this?

35:37.200 --> 35:37.840
Very strange

35:38.520 --> 35:39.240
Not surprising at all

35:39.680 --> 35:40.360
very beautiful

35:41.080 --> 35:41.680
real

35:43.640 --> 35:44.120
correct

35:45.040 --> 35:45.800
You just talked to them

35:45.840 --> 35:46.480
What have you said?

35:48.360 --> 35:49.360
I'll tell them

35:50.520 --> 35:51.360
I want to be with me

35:51.840 --> 35:52.840
The one you love proposes

35:57.720 --> 35:58.800
Full of lies

35:59.400 --> 36:00.480
I really think so

36:01.000 --> 36:01.520
look

36:04.920 --> 36:06.040
I even prepared the ring

36:15.600 --> 36:16.680
Okay, stop making trouble

36:17.480 --> 36:18.440
Let's take a photo

36:18.600 --> 36:19.680
Just leave it as a souvenir

36:21.280 --> 36:22.320
Just the two of us

36:23.080 --> 36:23.760
at this moment

36:23.920 --> 36:24.960
It's enough to be together

36:27.440 --> 36:27.880
bring it on

36:27.960 --> 36:29.160
Look here, you two.

36:30.200 --> 36:31.800
good very good

36:43.640 --> 36:44.320
good

36:46.240 --> 36:47.200
Let's make out

36:51.400 --> 36:52.400
Okay, one more

36:53.600 --> 36:54.080
good

36:54.600 --> 36:55.240
thank you

38:33.840 --> 38:34.600
I can't move this

38:35.080 --> 38:35.800
You can't move either

38:36.440 --> 38:37.160
I can't do this anymore

38:37.480 --> 38:38.240
what happened

38:38.440 --> 38:38.800
our firewall

38:38.960 --> 38:39.680
being attacked

38:39.920 --> 38:41.000
The system has activated an emergency state

38:41.280 --> 38:42.280
Turn off the Internet immediately

38:42.400 --> 38:42.920
lead

38:43.080 --> 38:44.000
This is a malicious attack

38:44.160 --> 38:45.360
It should be reported to the security department immediately

38:45.560 --> 38:46.200
I'll report it immediately

38:46.480 --> 38:47.640
You cut off the Internet immediately

38:47.840 --> 38:48.320
yes

39:02.240 --> 39:02.840
what happened

39:03.240 --> 39:03.960
half an hour ago

39:04.080 --> 39:04.800
Our network firewall

39:04.960 --> 39:05.680
Being maliciously attacked

39:05.920 --> 39:06.720
Have you cut off the Internet?

39:06.840 --> 39:07.280
cut off

39:07.320 --> 39:08.240
Data will not be leaked for the time being

39:08.400 --> 39:09.400
But there is already a problem with the intranet

39:09.520 --> 39:10.200
take us to see

39:10.360 --> 39:11.240
Good here

39:19.560 --> 39:20.280
Everyone here

39:31.680 --> 39:32.880
This is a virus attack

39:33.200 --> 39:34.440
I need to find the source of the virus

39:35.400 --> 39:36.080
Use my computer

39:36.400 --> 39:37.000
Please come this way

39:37.600 --> 39:38.080
good

39:39.040 --> 39:39.720
I suspect there is someone

39:39.880 --> 39:40.960
Hacked into our internal systems

39:42.120 --> 39:42.880
Group’s core data

39:43.080 --> 39:43.840
Where is it

39:44.480 --> 39:45.360
in data center

39:45.960 --> 39:46.680
data center

39:47.760 --> 39:48.760
Should we

39:49.040 --> 39:50.280
Go to some core departments and check

39:51.880 --> 39:53.360
Enter data center maintenance

39:53.680 --> 39:54.760
Requires personal approval from the Vice President

39:56.360 --> 39:57.000
Mr. Huang went to a meeting

39:57.240 --> 39:58.240
I've reported it to him

39:58.440 --> 39:59.040
request assistance

39:59.240 --> 40:00.080
National security personnel inspection

40:01.120 --> 40:01.640
All right

40:02.080 --> 40:02.640
follow me

40:03.120 --> 40:03.680
You lead the way

42:03.920 --> 42:05.240
Gao Tianyang is just a cover

42:06.240 --> 42:07.640
attract everyone's attention

42:08.960 --> 42:10.280
He is the real big fish

42:12.560 --> 42:13.240
Taking advantage of Huang Zicheng

42:13.280 --> 42:14.400
When attacking a network

42:15.240 --> 42:17.080
The sample was taken away quietly

42:18.080 --> 42:19.320
This plan is perfect

42:21.600 --> 42:22.160
need someone now

42:22.160 --> 42:22.920
Bring the sample back

42:24.360 --> 42:25.160
Isn’t it Boss Zhang?

42:28.080 --> 42:29.120
She wants to deal with Gao Tianyang

42:29.920 --> 42:30.720
The risk is too great

42:31.520 --> 42:32.360
we want to find one

42:33.120 --> 42:34.400
Someone who even the National Security Bureau trusts

42:37.000 --> 42:37.600
Yao Yao
