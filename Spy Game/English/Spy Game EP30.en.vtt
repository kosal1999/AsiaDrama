01:40.310 --> 01:41.039
Yusheng

01:41.710 --> 01:42.870
if you can't eat

01:44.000 --> 01:45.590
Or I'll make you sushi.

01:48.920 --> 01:50.039
Can I use your arm?

01:52.350 --> 01:53.150
piece of cake

02:18.240 --> 02:19.400
I'm going to the hospital today

02:20.960 --> 02:21.560
see someone

02:21.680 --> 02:22.710
looks like you

02:27.560 --> 02:28.360
I was originally today

02:28.360 --> 02:29.750
I'm going to the hospital too.

02:30.870 --> 02:31.430
is that so

02:32.680 --> 02:33.630
go to see friends

02:34.520 --> 02:35.310
Why don't you go?

02:38.840 --> 02:39.430
died

02:45.430 --> 02:46.000
Deep condolences to you

02:47.360 --> 02:48.150
It has passed

02:49.030 --> 02:49.630
I won't say it anymore

02:54.680 --> 02:55.750
Where is your brother?

02:56.190 --> 02:57.190
Has the problem been solved.

02:58.280 --> 02:59.150
I tried my best

03:01.080 --> 03:02.030
Can it be solved?

03:04.080 --> 03:04.960
Just depends on luck

03:06.710 --> 03:07.630
some things

03:09.190 --> 03:10.470
we have no control

03:11.560 --> 03:12.520
a bit troublesome

03:14.400 --> 03:15.910
Like falling dominoes

03:18.630 --> 03:19.430
1 person fell

03:21.280 --> 03:22.840
a series of reactions occur

03:27.000 --> 03:27.960
It seems that this is the trouble you have encountered recently

03:28.030 --> 03:28.710
so many

03:32.150 --> 03:32.910
I agree

03:34.079 --> 03:35.240
if i lose my job

03:36.150 --> 03:37.190
How about working part-time here?

03:38.590 --> 03:39.079
Understood

03:40.120 --> 03:40.910
what can I do?

03:44.120 --> 03:44.680
Lobby

03:47.430 --> 03:48.840
you really can't work

03:49.750 --> 03:50.840
follow me

03:51.079 --> 03:52.079
smile at each other

03:52.630 --> 03:53.400
not suitable for you

03:55.710 --> 03:56.870
What do you think I can do?

03:59.470 --> 03:59.960
be you

04:00.000 --> 04:01.430
this may be the best job

04:02.310 --> 04:02.960
Logically speaking

04:05.870 --> 04:06.840
I don't like the way it's done

04:07.470 --> 04:08.520
Change company

04:10.000 --> 04:11.360
please continue my daily work

04:14.190 --> 04:15.430
I've been doing this for years

04:15.720 --> 04:16.829
There are also certain resources

04:17.630 --> 04:19.430
Don't change jobs easily

04:20.720 --> 04:21.829
outside world

04:22.630 --> 04:24.600
Maybe it's just superficial greatness

04:25.270 --> 04:26.430
But my current job is

04:28.630 --> 04:30.160
i don't deserve it

04:31.870 --> 04:33.750
Things that have lost their value to you

04:34.430 --> 04:35.480
in the eyes of others

04:35.750 --> 04:37.040
it might be worth it

04:38.560 --> 04:39.040
is that so

04:39.510 --> 04:40.040
certainly

04:41.390 --> 04:42.360
it's in your eyes

04:44.270 --> 04:45.360
Am I worthy?

04:50.630 --> 04:51.510
you are with me

04:52.750 --> 04:54.430
cannot be measured by value

04:56.750 --> 04:58.040
You are me in Jinhai

04:59.360 --> 05:00.510
Important person

05:08.040 --> 05:08.600
taste

05:14.270 --> 05:15.270
I suddenly lost my appetite

05:18.830 --> 05:19.390
how

05:20.360 --> 05:21.430
Which word is mine?

05:22.270 --> 05:23.190
inspired you

05:26.040 --> 05:27.120
I'm not that weak

05:30.560 --> 05:31.240
Brother's troubles

05:31.510 --> 05:32.390
not yet resolved

05:34.750 --> 05:35.830
I still need to deal with

05:36.950 --> 05:37.560
Believe me

05:40.000 --> 05:41.390
his troubles will be solved

05:42.720 --> 05:44.040
This is also a woman’s intuition

05:54.720 --> 05:55.920
Sorry for your food

06:09.950 --> 06:10.870
Have the opportunity

06:13.160 --> 06:15.070
show me your true self

06:43.800 --> 06:44.360
Tianyang Brothers

06:44.950 --> 06:45.920
Why did you come back?

06:46.000 --> 06:46.600
I'm so anxious

06:50.510 --> 06:51.360
I'm having a little trouble

06:52.920 --> 06:53.430
that person

06:54.190 --> 06:54.800
Is it dead?

06:57.510 --> 06:58.000
died

07:04.160 --> 07:05.560
Do they doubt us?

07:08.750 --> 07:09.600
I can't pay that much attention

07:11.000 --> 07:12.390
Let’s go rescue Huang Zichen first.

07:13.750 --> 07:14.390
call

07:30.390 --> 07:31.190
work has been done

07:31.720 --> 07:32.830
I already know

07:33.390 --> 07:35.360
I would like to thank Manager Taka for his sincerity.

07:35.920 --> 07:36.830
let me know

07:56.310 --> 07:57.430
When can Zicheng come back?

07:58.830 --> 07:59.630
I think it will come soon

08:06.120 --> 08:06.600
Would you like something to drink?

08:08.870 --> 08:09.360
Thanks.

08:19.070 --> 08:20.390
when this work is completed

08:22.120 --> 08:23.120
I can't look back

08:25.600 --> 08:26.470
Night fog persists

08:26.670 --> 08:27.630
Demand more from us

08:30.000 --> 08:30.440
I know

08:31.720 --> 08:32.390
Next

08:33.360 --> 08:34.270
like we fall

08:34.360 --> 08:35.390
falling dominoes

08:36.909 --> 08:37.510
Go together

08:37.549 --> 08:38.669
No chance to hit the brakes

08:41.270 --> 08:41.789
Thanks.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.270
no matter what comes next

08:47.360 --> 08:48.080
Things are unpredictable

08:49.550 --> 08:50.270
be prepared

08:53.320 --> 08:53.840
I know

08:54.550 --> 08:55.240
Next step

08:55.550 --> 08:56.320
what are you going to do

08:58.870 --> 09:00.360
Let’s wait until Huang Zicheng is safe.

09:02.360 --> 09:03.200
if you listen to me

09:04.960 --> 09:06.240
I think of a way to protect you

09:07.910 --> 09:08.670
if i'm okay

09:10.030 --> 09:10.750
How are you

09:13.510 --> 09:14.600
Thank you, Brother Tianyang

09:17.390 --> 09:18.240
I have one more condition

09:21.240 --> 09:21.720
you

09:23.360 --> 09:24.200
Don't give up Huang Zichen

09:24.320 --> 09:25.240
continue to participate

09:31.030 --> 09:31.480
I know

09:33.630 --> 09:34.240
I want to sever ties with him

09:34.390 --> 09:35.200
All contacts

09:35.600 --> 09:37.000
Do you think you can do it yourself?

09:38.600 --> 09:39.270
must

09:40.960 --> 09:42.000
if it's not my fault

09:43.870 --> 09:44.440
Neither can he

09:44.550 --> 09:45.440
just like now

09:48.840 --> 09:49.670
They have been in the past few days

09:49.720 --> 09:50.390
Can let people go

09:51.910 --> 09:53.390
Leave the next thing to me

09:55.000 --> 09:55.870
as necessary

09:56.910 --> 09:57.630
We will contact you

10:00.150 --> 10:00.600
OK

10:38.200 --> 10:38.910
pull him up

11:27.600 --> 11:28.270
Inject him

11:29.270 --> 11:30.080
don't let me die

11:30.600 --> 11:31.030
OK

11:38.870 --> 11:40.270
you are a lucky boy

11:41.550 --> 11:42.870
can someone help

12:23.720 --> 12:24.270
woke up

12:42.670 --> 12:43.720
What have they done for me?

12:45.150 --> 12:45.790
stabilizer

12:57.240 --> 12:58.360
They are looking for you after all

13:02.360 --> 13:03.390
You are in a good situation.

13:04.080 --> 13:04.670
Yao Yao sent

13:07.870 --> 13:08.240
elder brother

13:08.790 --> 13:09.150
Welcome back

13:10.070 --> 13:10.600
Have you eaten yet?

13:11.030 --> 13:11.510
I haven't eaten it yet

13:12.030 --> 13:12.910
I haven't eaten yet. I'll go make you some.

14:12.360 --> 14:13.000
you

14:13.720 --> 14:15.390
Don't be too emotional

14:36.870 --> 14:37.440
It's Yaoyao

14:38.480 --> 14:39.240
I think you're exposed

14:39.240 --> 14:40.030
sooner or later

14:41.630 --> 14:42.790
I just didn't expect it to be so early

14:45.080 --> 14:46.360
But why would she do this?

14:49.200 --> 14:49.840
spies may become suspicious

14:49.840 --> 14:50.550
your identity

14:51.600 --> 14:52.790
Exposure is not necessarily a bad thing

14:54.150 --> 14:54.790
What does it mean?

14:55.910 --> 14:56.960
when they have questions

14:57.670 --> 14:58.750
You can cheat this time

14:59.630 --> 15:00.750
But next time I won't be able to hide it anymore

15:03.550 --> 15:04.150
Better yet, tell them

15:04.200 --> 15:05.150
find your identity

15:05.550 --> 15:06.600
What do you mean?

15:10.390 --> 15:10.840
Give me

15:11.080 --> 15:11.670
send you away

15:12.390 --> 15:13.120
I'm not kidding

15:13.390 --> 15:14.360
When did you do this?

15:14.360 --> 15:15.000
I'm kidding

15:22.120 --> 15:23.120
You want them to come to you.

15:25.360 --> 15:26.390
if my identity is revealed

15:27.080 --> 15:27.840
this is for them

15:28.000 --> 15:29.120
you have no value

15:29.750 --> 15:30.320
you

15:30.440 --> 15:30.870
Apart from

15:31.510 --> 15:32.720
They're using me to blackmail you.

15:35.670 --> 15:36.030
Yes

15:37.550 --> 15:38.150
How are you

15:38.550 --> 15:39.790
Of course I have ways to deal with them.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.120
listen to me

15:43.200 --> 15:44.790
Don't be impulsive when in danger

15:45.480 --> 15:46.240
protect yourself

15:46.630 --> 15:47.630
don't do anything else

15:51.270 --> 15:52.390
Although I'm a little dissatisfied

15:53.080 --> 15:53.630
but this time

15:54.360 --> 15:55.320
I made you do the right thing

15:56.320 --> 15:57.360
I told you

15:57.750 --> 15:59.120
Don’t be impulsive when encountering danger

15:59.600 --> 16:00.670
why are you rebellious

16:01.440 --> 16:02.790
This is my desire for life

16:03.750 --> 16:04.870
Tony is a suspicious person.

16:05.080 --> 16:05.840
if i'm quiet

16:05.840 --> 16:06.510
elusive

16:06.600 --> 16:07.720
He must be doubting me

16:09.550 --> 16:11.120
It tastes like it's been submerged in sea water.

16:11.360 --> 16:12.000
it's painful

16:13.480 --> 16:14.480
I am very smart myself

16:17.720 --> 16:18.750
What is it used for?

16:20.630 --> 16:21.600
let us do something for them

16:22.720 --> 16:23.200
What

16:27.120 --> 16:27.510
Did not say

16:28.270 --> 16:28.790
Confidentiality maintained

16:29.670 --> 16:30.150
I don't listen

16:32.510 --> 16:33.390
they promised me

16:33.600 --> 16:34.790
I won't bother you anymore

16:41.480 --> 16:42.150
Where is Yaoyao?

16:42.910 --> 16:43.720
How did that happen?

16:43.840 --> 16:44.550
I didn't see her

16:48.080 --> 16:49.200
she betrayed you

16:49.670 --> 16:50.840
It's not worth worrying about her

16:52.440 --> 16:53.790
She also has unavoidable difficulties.

16:54.150 --> 16:54.510
The fog that night

16:54.510 --> 16:55.840
Threaten her family

16:56.960 --> 16:58.110
when i soak in the sea

16:58.350 --> 16:59.350
i want to know everything

17:00.510 --> 17:01.270
Night fog man

17:01.270 --> 17:02.640
You doubted me from the beginning

17:03.070 --> 17:04.240
They asked me to steal data

17:04.240 --> 17:05.200
come try me

17:05.829 --> 17:07.030
They are already sunny

17:07.069 --> 17:07.640
Still using me

17:08.310 --> 17:09.550
come try me

17:10.230 --> 17:11.349
I am not Yaoyao who was sold.

17:12.480 --> 17:13.640
She bugged you.

17:14.270 --> 17:15.720
I'll also take you to the fishing boat.

17:16.640 --> 17:17.200
Yes

17:17.240 --> 17:18.790
I think she threatened people.

17:18.880 --> 17:19.920
That wasn't her intention

17:20.349 --> 17:21.349
There's no need to run away for her

17:22.880 --> 17:24.109
whether forced or not

17:24.680 --> 17:25.720
she is a spy

17:28.400 --> 17:28.830
take a look

17:29.000 --> 17:30.030
She knows both of us

17:30.350 --> 17:30.880
been touched

17:30.960 --> 17:31.310
perhaps

17:31.920 --> 17:32.550
but she didn't say

17:32.640 --> 17:33.110
Night fog man

17:33.240 --> 17:33.920
What does it mean

17:35.030 --> 17:36.000
She said she wanted to go ashore

17:36.160 --> 17:37.240
But no chance

17:38.350 --> 17:38.880
she is the last

17:39.030 --> 17:40.160
What did you say to me?

17:41.160 --> 17:41.720
if i am early

17:41.920 --> 17:42.750
i should tell her

17:44.880 --> 17:45.200
Huang Zicheng

17:45.310 --> 17:46.070
Ask me clearly

17:47.070 --> 17:48.030
this is not a game

17:48.400 --> 17:49.350
Not so much

17:53.480 --> 17:54.070
I know

17:55.350 --> 17:57.160
I won't run away for her

17:57.750 --> 17:58.830
I just want to tell you

17:59.160 --> 18:00.550
she's not completely corrupt

18:00.830 --> 18:01.720
she still has hope

18:02.750 --> 18:03.830
if there is a chance

18:04.830 --> 18:05.640
See if you can.

18:06.270 --> 18:06.920
save her

18:07.750 --> 18:09.480
This is a brutal killing

18:10.200 --> 18:12.000
instead of saving fallen souls

18:12.350 --> 18:12.920
do you understand

18:16.680 --> 18:17.110
knew

18:21.270 --> 18:22.550
If she still has hope in her heart

18:24.160 --> 18:25.310
She will teach with her actions

18:26.880 --> 18:28.510
What are you doing?

18:32.030 --> 18:32.790
you can exit

18:34.510 --> 18:35.030
end

18:35.790 --> 18:37.030
When you are done with me I will throw me away

18:37.200 --> 18:38.440
I won't abandon you

18:39.030 --> 18:40.240
The spy abandoned you

18:42.480 --> 18:43.440
you have landed

18:44.550 --> 18:45.240
later action

18:46.480 --> 18:47.350
you don't need to join

18:48.590 --> 18:49.680
But before the event is over

18:50.550 --> 18:51.400
Be careful

18:53.270 --> 18:54.480
if they contact you

18:55.680 --> 18:56.480
contact me anytime

18:59.400 --> 19:00.030
The game is?

19:00.350 --> 19:00.960
Should I continue?

19:04.270 --> 19:04.920
let go

19:06.160 --> 19:07.480
If I need you I will go to you

19:14.550 --> 19:15.000
It doesn't matter

19:18.790 --> 19:19.350
For you

19:19.400 --> 19:20.400
Just go back to the beginning

19:28.030 --> 19:28.510
Now

19:28.720 --> 19:30.110
I'm not the same anymore

20:18.200 --> 20:19.200
I'll send you the address

20:19.590 --> 20:20.270
see you later.

20:22.830 --> 20:23.270
OK

20:50.480 --> 20:51.590
This is a secret base

21:31.960 --> 21:32.480
Qin area

21:36.680 --> 21:37.240
Qin area

21:38.070 --> 21:38.920
Sorry Wu Xi

21:39.790 --> 21:40.440
we give you

21:40.480 --> 21:41.440
I hid this

21:43.720 --> 21:45.030
It seemed like I was the only one surrounded by the sound of drums

21:47.070 --> 21:47.550
sit down

21:49.000 --> 21:50.350
you are part of the plan

21:56.030 --> 21:56.920
your plan is

21:57.270 --> 21:58.270
since when

21:59.350 --> 22:00.310
I discovered Yaoyao

22:00.510 --> 22:02.070
I began to doubt Huang Zichen's identity.

22:04.830 --> 22:05.590
Do you remember Yaoyao?

22:05.640 --> 22:06.440
Can you treat me to dinner?

22:07.510 --> 22:08.880
when she just came back from thailand

22:09.640 --> 22:10.350
meal time

22:10.440 --> 22:11.310
I found the details

22:14.160 --> 22:15.240
Your phone case is nice.

22:16.640 --> 22:17.160
Yao Yao sent

22:18.880 --> 22:19.920
She suddenly gave Huang Zichen a gift.

22:20.070 --> 22:20.830
1 mobile phone case

22:21.510 --> 22:22.510
I have a little doubt

22:23.110 --> 22:23.790
I'll check it out

22:23.920 --> 22:24.920
There's a bug inside

22:25.790 --> 22:27.200
At that moment I was convinced

22:27.480 --> 22:28.440
Huang Zichen’s identity

22:28.440 --> 22:29.070
has been exposed

22:29.590 --> 22:31.070
Sooner or later he will take action against Huang Zichen.

22:32.680 --> 22:33.510
so do something

22:33.720 --> 22:34.550
give them a goal

22:34.640 --> 22:35.440
forwarded to you

22:36.200 --> 22:36.550
Yes

22:38.000 --> 22:38.880
I did it on purpose

22:38.960 --> 22:39.790
Secrets from the National Security Agency

22:40.070 --> 22:40.550
secretly

22:40.640 --> 22:41.880
Help Huang Zicheng's virtual image

22:42.880 --> 22:43.350
Just at this time

22:43.510 --> 22:44.270
Shoichi caused the accident.

22:45.110 --> 22:46.590
Then Yogiri started trying.

22:47.400 --> 22:47.920
He has

22:47.920 --> 22:48.880
Huang Zicheng came to threaten me.

22:49.590 --> 22:50.830
Let's kill Shoichi.

22:52.350 --> 22:52.960
Was it your hand?

22:53.680 --> 22:54.240
No

22:55.590 --> 22:56.440
I propose to Yogiri

22:56.510 --> 22:57.550
I need help

22:58.070 --> 22:58.550
on this occasion

22:58.720 --> 22:59.920
You can pull this boss out

23:00.830 --> 23:01.640
but i never thought

23:02.640 --> 23:03.880
He asked Yaoyao to act.

23:05.790 --> 23:07.160
So you took advantage of Yaoyao

23:07.440 --> 23:07.790
Yes

24:07.270 --> 24:08.270
people in morgue

24:09.240 --> 24:10.030
Probably not Soo Yi

24:11.110 --> 24:11.510
certainly

24:26.920 --> 24:27.880
body bag zipper

24:27.880 --> 24:28.590
Did you do any tricks?

24:28.920 --> 24:29.640
they are difficult to open

24:30.480 --> 24:31.480
Don't let people find out

24:32.790 --> 24:34.160
Do you think Mr. Zhang will go?

24:34.880 --> 24:35.550
she doesn't believe me

24:35.920 --> 24:36.510
She will definitely go

24:37.680 --> 24:38.960
The show is for them

24:39.030 --> 24:39.720
Very important

24:40.640 --> 24:42.070
Your plan is so detailed

24:42.480 --> 24:43.880
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

24:45.270 --> 24:46.200
because you are right

24:46.200 --> 24:47.680
Suspects about Sauer's death

24:48.920 --> 24:50.310
It's also part of our plan

24:52.830 --> 24:54.070
everything went smoothly

24:54.830 --> 24:56.440
Even people who look at me are suspicious.

24:57.110 --> 24:57.830
your concerns

24:59.070 --> 25:00.550
Just hiding my danger

25:01.310 --> 25:02.480
even if you tell me

25:02.640 --> 25:03.680
I will also cooperate

25:04.680 --> 25:06.030
The fog from the previous night shrouded Yaoyao.

25:06.200 --> 25:07.030
A listening device was installed

25:07.750 --> 25:08.440
I have no idea

25:08.920 --> 25:10.310
Is there eyeliner around me?

25:10.310 --> 25:10.960
I did not notice

25:11.680 --> 25:12.640
that's why i decided

25:13.030 --> 25:13.750
this drama

25:14.000 --> 25:14.640
the truth

25:16.480 --> 25:16.920
I agree

25:17.880 --> 25:19.000
Your stations are connected to each other

25:19.960 --> 25:20.960
If there is even the slightest omission

25:21.270 --> 25:22.160
i will lose everything

25:22.750 --> 25:23.270
that's why

25:23.720 --> 25:24.550
Must be careful

25:26.790 --> 25:27.200
Wuxi

25:28.030 --> 25:29.310
You are now officially joining

25:30.110 --> 25:31.640
Become a Fisherman Project Member

25:32.640 --> 25:33.510
forest plan

25:54.200 --> 25:54.680
here we go

26:00.070 --> 26:01.750
Current Director of the Fisherman Project

26:01.750 --> 26:02.640
We are not in the Tianjin Hai Bureau.

26:03.200 --> 26:04.350
in the security department

26:04.830 --> 26:05.510
You look like Director Zhao.

26:05.590 --> 26:07.000
and other engineers

26:07.350 --> 26:09.240
Everything is borrowed from the ministries.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.070
with the two people in front of you

26:11.240 --> 26:11.960
all ministries

26:11.960 --> 26:13.110
The detective who was transferred

26:13.480 --> 26:14.480
This special operations group

26:14.640 --> 26:15.200
behind the scenes

26:15.350 --> 26:16.750
support this action

26:17.550 --> 26:18.680
Fisherman's plan goals

26:18.750 --> 26:19.270
What

26:23.350 --> 26:24.160
Xinglin behavior

26:24.830 --> 26:26.270
this is a huge plan

26:26.830 --> 26:27.960
The first step is to look up at the sun

26:28.110 --> 26:29.310
Win Mr. Zhang’s trust

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
through her

26:31.240 --> 26:32.790
Tsui's spy network

26:33.350 --> 26:33.920
eradicate

26:34.750 --> 26:35.400
since it was discovered

26:35.510 --> 26:36.110
Mr. Zhang

26:36.350 --> 26:37.350
Why can't we catch it directly?

26:38.110 --> 26:38.960
because

26:39.030 --> 26:40.550
This Mr. Zhang is playing a game.

26:40.880 --> 26:41.830
There is another one online

26:42.640 --> 26:43.510
in spy games

26:44.310 --> 26:44.720
Yes

26:45.440 --> 26:46.030
She and this person

26:46.160 --> 26:47.550
Please contact me only during games

26:47.920 --> 26:48.880
This person's name is Z

26:49.680 --> 26:50.720
He is in control

26:50.830 --> 26:51.440
of all industries

26:51.480 --> 26:52.400
User repository

26:53.160 --> 26:53.880
As long as Mr. Zhang is here

26:54.000 --> 26:54.680
what kind of person do you need

26:54.830 --> 26:55.310
tell him

26:55.830 --> 26:57.030
He can give you some goals

26:57.350 --> 26:58.200
and their materials

26:59.310 --> 27:00.030
Who is Z?

27:00.480 --> 27:01.070
we don't even know

27:01.720 --> 27:02.480
Maybe Mr. Zhang

27:02.790 --> 27:03.510
I don't know who it is

27:05.400 --> 27:05.830
and

27:06.110 --> 27:06.590
Mr. Zhang holds it in his hand.

27:06.720 --> 27:07.640
Another trump card

27:08.310 --> 27:09.830
Hidden within biota

27:11.160 --> 27:11.880
before us

27:12.070 --> 27:13.000
I always thought it was Huang Zichen

27:13.030 --> 27:14.110
This is their trump card

27:14.590 --> 27:15.510
at this point

27:15.960 --> 27:17.030
He is just a tool

27:17.680 --> 27:18.550
Is the news reliable?

27:19.310 --> 27:19.960
Sauce

27:20.000 --> 27:21.070
A man was abandoned in the night fog

27:21.960 --> 27:22.830
Shore wakes up

27:24.920 --> 27:25.350
Wuxi

27:25.550 --> 27:27.270
You were involved in this operation

27:27.750 --> 27:29.110
The goal is to find it

27:29.790 --> 27:30.400
in game

27:30.640 --> 27:31.440
I can understand one thing

27:31.550 --> 27:32.480
User materials for various industries

27:32.680 --> 27:33.400
database user

27:33.790 --> 27:34.070
Z

27:34.270 --> 27:34.790
give it to me

27:35.590 --> 27:36.160
Tianyang

27:37.030 --> 27:38.110
You continue to contact Mr. Zhang.

27:38.310 --> 27:39.480
Find all her offline status

27:39.920 --> 27:40.720
Especially hidden things

27:40.880 --> 27:41.720
within biological group

27:41.880 --> 27:42.550
That trump card

27:43.400 --> 27:43.880
make out

27:52.400 --> 27:53.200
feels good

27:55.310 --> 27:56.270
This answered my heart

27:56.440 --> 27:57.590
big problem

27:59.160 --> 28:00.750
Yogiri is on a secret service mission.

28:00.880 --> 28:01.440
what is developing

28:01.550 --> 28:02.680
The origins of gamers

28:03.030 --> 28:03.590
High probability

28:03.680 --> 28:04.880
This is Mr. Z

28:06.110 --> 28:07.480
You can provide a repository like this

28:07.750 --> 28:09.200
Most likely a major site

28:09.350 --> 28:10.720
of these users

28:10.880 --> 28:12.160
Work and life information

28:12.720 --> 28:13.200
Yes

28:15.440 --> 28:16.510
But there are many such websites

28:17.550 --> 28:18.920
Find players we know

28:19.070 --> 28:20.070
Find out what they signed up for

28:20.240 --> 28:21.510
Applicable websites

28:21.750 --> 28:22.790
I think you'll find it soon

28:23.640 --> 28:24.030
able

28:25.880 --> 28:26.790
I have a hunch

28:28.160 --> 28:28.790
this clue

28:29.000 --> 28:30.030
may help us

28:30.240 --> 28:30.960
Basically

28:31.110 --> 28:32.680
Eliminate spy games in one go

28:35.200 --> 28:36.030
that's optimistic

28:36.590 --> 28:37.590
Of course that is

28:38.070 --> 28:39.350
I'm not you

28:39.590 --> 28:40.200
everything

28:40.200 --> 28:41.270
I only want bad things

28:41.350 --> 28:43.030
I was doing this so deeply by myself all day long.

28:43.880 --> 28:44.310
but you know

28:44.400 --> 28:45.200
I still praise you

28:45.880 --> 28:47.590
Planning is tightly cyclical.

28:47.720 --> 28:48.550
Protect Huang Zicheng

28:48.720 --> 28:49.590
I brought Principal Zhang out.

28:49.720 --> 28:51.000
I also earned her trust in you.

28:51.920 --> 28:53.440
Even if you say so, I'm amazing.

28:56.240 --> 28:57.480
this is a bit disappointing

28:59.270 --> 29:00.270
if she wasn't alone

29:00.400 --> 29:01.550
spy story

29:02.350 --> 29:03.070
you two are

29:03.200 --> 29:04.310
this is perfect for you

29:07.830 --> 29:08.550
I approached her

29:08.640 --> 29:10.030
Because I think she's suspicious.

29:10.350 --> 29:11.240
hope so

29:11.720 --> 29:12.440
this is not the end

29:16.440 --> 29:17.830
What are you going to do now?

29:18.200 --> 29:19.030
You're not done yet.

29:19.240 --> 29:21.550
The ones I mentioned are Huang Zicheng and Yao Yao.

29:26.400 --> 29:27.310
Yaoyao didn't touch her first.

29:27.920 --> 29:29.070
She is my best support

29:30.110 --> 29:30.790
Huang Zicheng

29:30.880 --> 29:32.000
I've sent him out

29:33.790 --> 29:34.510
you replaced

29:34.590 --> 29:35.480
Huang Zicheng’s location

29:36.350 --> 29:37.200
He and Yaoyao

29:37.270 --> 29:37.720
divided into

29:38.110 --> 29:38.920
Can it be divided?

29:39.030 --> 29:39.960
Even if you can't split it, you still get points.

29:40.480 --> 29:41.110
now in his mind

29:41.200 --> 29:42.160
That must be sad

29:51.070 --> 29:53.160
You said this person really doesn't talk.

29:55.240 --> 29:56.000
I'm driving.

29:57.240 --> 29:57.720
what are you saying

29:59.400 --> 30:00.960
Just believe me

30:01.110 --> 30:02.550
feeling abandoned

30:04.480 --> 30:06.110
don't comfort him

30:06.790 --> 30:07.240
no need

30:09.160 --> 30:09.830
bad

30:51.720 --> 30:53.030
The mission went smoothly

30:53.750 --> 30:54.480
I didn't misunderstand you

30:56.590 --> 30:57.440
That promise is

30:57.440 --> 30:58.270
Turn it into cash quickly

30:59.160 --> 30:59.880
certainly

31:01.000 --> 31:03.030
Your sister can leave at any time

31:03.960 --> 31:04.720
promise

31:05.200 --> 31:05.640
OK

31:06.920 --> 31:07.350
I?

31:08.440 --> 31:08.830
is that so

31:08.830 --> 31:09.830
I can leave Jinhai.

31:11.790 --> 31:12.640
You are in Jinhai

31:13.480 --> 31:14.510
I have other responsibilities

31:18.790 --> 31:20.310
The purpose of dragging Huang Zichen into the water

31:20.480 --> 31:21.680
Just to control Huang Jiaming.

31:23.720 --> 31:24.200
Now Huang Zicheng

31:24.310 --> 31:25.510
It’s no longer valuable

31:26.110 --> 31:26.960
The scorching sun is also coming for you

31:27.070 --> 31:27.960
draw water

31:29.440 --> 31:30.000
Leave me in Jinhai

31:30.070 --> 31:30.920
Useless

31:32.310 --> 31:33.160
How could you leave in such a hurry?

31:34.070 --> 31:34.680
i killed someone

31:36.400 --> 31:37.510
It's too dangerous to stay here

31:38.920 --> 31:40.160
It's safe to return to headquarters.

31:42.030 --> 31:43.160
you do not need to worry

31:44.200 --> 31:45.270
Jinjing now

31:45.550 --> 31:46.550
your best place

31:48.480 --> 31:48.880
Why

31:49.680 --> 31:51.960
Gao Tianyang has arrived at Jinhai.

31:52.030 --> 31:53.110
mobile umbrella

31:53.350 --> 31:54.240
as long as you need

31:54.550 --> 31:56.030
he will help you work

31:56.310 --> 31:57.590
come back now

31:58.310 --> 31:59.680
Such a relationship is a waste

32:02.400 --> 32:03.000
but i still

32:03.000 --> 32:03.920
What tasks will you perform?

32:05.160 --> 32:06.270
The organization has plans

32:11.000 --> 32:11.830
when i

32:11.920 --> 32:12.920
to complete the task

32:13.550 --> 32:14.480
hope

32:15.070 --> 32:16.200
I can do it forever

32:17.440 --> 32:18.200
You still here

32:18.440 --> 32:19.920
I want to be with Huang Zichen

32:25.310 --> 32:25.880
You are me and him

32:25.960 --> 32:26.790
Is it okay?

32:27.750 --> 32:28.750
if he knows you

32:29.110 --> 32:29.920
Kill for him

32:31.350 --> 32:32.400
terribly sorry

32:33.000 --> 32:33.640
but you already are

32:33.640 --> 32:34.510
I promise to heaven

32:34.880 --> 32:35.720
you promised heaven

32:35.750 --> 32:36.960
I won't use yellow anymore.

32:37.550 --> 32:38.240
I don't use him

32:39.440 --> 32:40.070
You still here

32:42.110 --> 32:44.310
Face things you can't control

32:45.310 --> 32:46.270
You must learn to accept

32:47.110 --> 32:47.880
enjoy

32:52.640 --> 32:53.070
OK

32:55.960 --> 32:57.030
But I have one more thing to do.

32:59.480 --> 33:00.440
I don't want any more interceptions

33:00.510 --> 33:01.310
continue

33:02.200 --> 33:02.720
no problem

33:03.750 --> 33:04.680
I believe you now.

34:03.800 --> 34:04.800
You sent me home suddenly

34:04.920 --> 34:06.480
what happened

34:06.840 --> 34:07.280
elder sister

34:09.480 --> 34:10.320
I've been doing this for a while

34:10.480 --> 34:11.670
I can't explain it to you either.

34:12.440 --> 34:13.550
I can only tell you

34:14.480 --> 34:15.440
being threatened

34:16.230 --> 34:17.630
They threaten me with your safety

34:18.230 --> 34:18.920
threaten

34:19.550 --> 34:20.360
Who are you?

34:20.710 --> 34:21.480
Did you report the crime to the police?

34:21.630 --> 34:22.280
I have no choice

34:22.280 --> 34:23.230
i will tell you everything

34:24.400 --> 34:25.920
The police can't control this

34:27.070 --> 34:27.630
just if

34:27.630 --> 34:28.710
You have been in the United States.

34:30.190 --> 34:31.400
they will continue to threaten me

34:32.280 --> 34:33.440
Trying to blackmail me into doing something

34:34.840 --> 34:36.150
what i don't want to do

34:37.150 --> 34:38.550
But my current job is

34:38.670 --> 34:40.110
Will you listen to me this time?

34:40.710 --> 34:42.320
You can look for it again after you get back from get off work.

34:43.840 --> 34:44.630
I just want to

34:44.760 --> 34:45.320
Both of us

34:45.360 --> 34:46.150
peace, security

34:46.150 --> 34:47.070
living together

34:47.630 --> 34:48.150
I can

34:51.920 --> 34:52.320
OK

34:54.190 --> 34:55.000
i listen to you

34:56.190 --> 34:56.960
We look forward to your return.

35:03.960 --> 35:04.760
What we know so far

35:04.840 --> 35:05.550
game player

35:05.880 --> 35:07.480
All users browsing the site

35:08.110 --> 35:08.920
of which pure

35:09.480 --> 35:10.070
Shi Lei

35:10.630 --> 35:11.110
Zhu Yan

35:11.550 --> 35:12.070
sunny

35:12.710 --> 35:13.630
All from the Tetsuzo website

35:13.670 --> 35:14.480
Deep users

35:15.710 --> 35:16.360
Read aloud

35:16.710 --> 35:17.110
Yes

35:17.840 --> 35:18.920
I'm currently learning about

35:18.920 --> 35:19.920
Client work information

35:20.000 --> 35:21.150
Hobby website

35:21.230 --> 35:21.920
Not so much

35:22.110 --> 35:23.630
But Tetsuya is one of them.

35:24.590 --> 35:26.000
So far we have not disclosed

35:26.000 --> 35:26.710
one question

35:27.760 --> 35:29.590
Agent task selection mechanism

35:30.550 --> 35:31.550
What should I do if it’s foggy at night?

35:31.590 --> 35:33.510
among a huge user base

35:33.550 --> 35:35.590
Choose the one that is most useful to them

35:35.920 --> 35:36.760
excellent player

35:37.280 --> 35:38.280
and pull them into the water

35:39.880 --> 35:40.400
Read aloud

35:41.030 --> 35:42.000
Currently domestic

35:42.110 --> 35:43.320
The most professional influence

35:43.400 --> 35:44.150
Q&A session

35:44.840 --> 35:46.280
it contains many things

35:46.280 --> 35:47.550
Professional positions

35:48.070 --> 35:49.550
People who like to visit this site

35:49.800 --> 35:50.480
academically

35:50.510 --> 35:51.630
There is a certain threshold

35:52.110 --> 35:52.590
some of them

35:52.760 --> 35:54.150
contains a lot

35:54.280 --> 35:55.880
people who work confidentially

35:56.070 --> 35:57.190
Like Shi Lei

35:57.550 --> 35:58.030
Zhu Yan

35:58.760 --> 35:59.230
sunny

35:59.800 --> 36:00.920
or participate in

36:01.110 --> 36:02.670
Major-related students

36:03.110 --> 36:03.920
just like dad

36:05.110 --> 36:05.510
Yes

36:06.710 --> 36:08.030
target audience

36:08.510 --> 36:09.280
Covered up spies

36:09.440 --> 36:10.480
a group of people you want to attract

36:10.840 --> 36:11.710
If the night fog comes

36:11.840 --> 36:13.110
User information by industry

36:13.360 --> 36:14.230
can be easily pulled

36:14.360 --> 36:15.230
desired goal

36:16.280 --> 36:16.960
later

36:17.230 --> 36:18.190
make believe

36:18.320 --> 36:20.440
Philosophical reading and spy games

36:20.480 --> 36:21.280
I'm sure there's a connection

36:22.920 --> 36:23.400
Yao Yao

36:23.590 --> 36:23.960
Yes

36:24.960 --> 36:26.150
Yaoyao is a philosopher.

36:26.430 --> 36:27.630
This may not be a coincidence

36:30.590 --> 36:31.670
Your guess is

36:32.110 --> 36:32.840
convincing

36:34.280 --> 36:35.000
but

36:35.400 --> 36:36.840
Again, there is not enough evidence to support this

36:38.110 --> 36:38.670
right now we

36:38.760 --> 36:40.230
We still need to break through

36:43.510 --> 36:45.000
I think Yaoyao knows.

36:45.400 --> 36:46.630
Is there a relationship between reading philosophy and games?

36:49.760 --> 36:50.760
she shouldn't know

36:52.150 --> 36:52.760
I think

36:52.840 --> 36:54.000
Mr. Z in the game

36:54.110 --> 36:55.360
hidden in philosophy

36:56.190 --> 36:57.320
if we can find him

36:57.550 --> 36:58.320
this is the best

37:38.550 --> 37:39.110
Thanks.

37:42.150 --> 37:43.710
Please give me a glass of the same thing.

37:43.760 --> 37:44.190
Thanks.

37:44.400 --> 37:44.840
OK

37:58.190 --> 37:59.320
How long have we not seen each other?

38:01.760 --> 38:02.150
1 week

38:06.280 --> 38:07.320
haven't seen you for a long time

38:11.880 --> 38:12.590
After disembarking

38:14.000 --> 38:14.710
what have you done

38:15.360 --> 38:16.030
i know everything

38:21.110 --> 38:22.360
Little Tianyou taught me

38:24.030 --> 38:25.590
Pull the Kokuan people into the water

38:27.840 --> 38:28.280
You know

38:28.280 --> 38:29.400
Is this serious?

38:29.670 --> 38:30.230
I know

38:31.710 --> 38:32.760
but i have to do it

38:33.800 --> 38:34.710
you really don't need

38:34.710 --> 38:35.320
come and save me

38:35.320 --> 38:36.110
so

38:42.150 --> 38:42.710
yourself

38:42.800 --> 38:43.840
looks important

38:47.000 --> 38:48.320
The person who wants to save you is Gao Tianyang.

38:50.280 --> 38:51.670
Yogiri takes advantage of this.

38:52.880 --> 38:54.150
I am originally a night fog person.

38:55.630 --> 38:56.710
This is the mission they gave me.

38:58.400 --> 38:58.800
Task# Task#

39:01.960 --> 39:02.400
I can't even say

39:02.440 --> 39:03.800
this is not your fault

39:06.550 --> 39:07.280
In the end we both

39:07.320 --> 39:08.150
get acquainted

39:10.710 --> 39:11.510
but

39:13.230 --> 39:15.030
we all cheated on each other

39:17.230 --> 39:17.840
but i can't

39:17.920 --> 39:19.760
I will leave you to die alone.

39:23.070 --> 39:24.110
so save you

39:27.190 --> 39:28.480
in order to complete the mission

39:39.670 --> 39:41.000
Are you still helping Yogiri do his job?

39:44.670 --> 39:45.960
Are there any other options?

39:47.150 --> 39:47.840
practical things

39:47.880 --> 39:49.110
Things are not as bad as you think

39:50.000 --> 39:51.510
I know you are threatened

39:52.000 --> 39:52.630
you still have a chance

39:52.670 --> 39:53.760
be a hero

39:55.760 --> 39:57.150
you can't save anything

40:02.400 --> 40:03.880
you forget

40:06.630 --> 40:07.590
avoid these things

40:11.110 --> 40:12.110
Finally landed

40:13.510 --> 40:14.630
Stop participating

40:14.960 --> 40:15.360
I can

40:23.880 --> 40:25.000
It's over between us

40:32.110 --> 40:33.920
From the moment you step on the plane

40:34.920 --> 40:36.190
It's over now

40:46.760 --> 40:47.800
That's why I'm leaving no stone unturned today

40:47.800 --> 40:48.960
chose this place

40:50.030 --> 40:50.880
I was just thinking

40:53.280 --> 40:54.480
where does it start

40:54.960 --> 40:55.920
end somewhere

40:56.670 --> 40:57.190
sounds good

41:00.440 --> 41:01.800
I like this sense of ceremony

41:04.590 --> 41:05.590
this looks slick

41:25.760 --> 41:26.710
Do you regret it?

41:29.000 --> 41:29.590
what do you regret

41:31.400 --> 41:32.150
I regret knowing you

41:33.230 --> 41:33.760
return

41:34.070 --> 41:35.400
sorry for what we went through

41:41.360 --> 41:42.710
Nothing to regret

41:45.960 --> 41:47.110
It's impossible anyway

41:47.110 --> 41:48.440
let's try again

41:51.590 --> 41:53.150
rather than clinging to it

41:53.960 --> 41:55.000
It would be better if you open your eyes a little wider

41:55.320 --> 41:56.000
go ahead

41:59.190 --> 42:00.710
we are in this world

42:02.480 --> 42:03.320
everything is just one

42:03.360 --> 42:04.630
small dust

42:06.360 --> 42:07.670
Not everyone is that important

42:35.070 --> 42:35.590
goodbye.
