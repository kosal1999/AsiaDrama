Tony.

02:11.340 --> 02:12.500
This is B13 sample

02:12.500 --> 02:13.220

[Night City]

03:31.900 --> 03:33.000
Have you accomplished your mission?

03:33.500 --> 03:34.100
No.

03:35.670 --> 03:36.220
Why?

03:36.630 --> 03:37.740
You know the answer.

03:40.340 --> 03:41.380
Why are you messing with us?

03:41.810 --> 03:42.610
screw you?

03:44.760 --> 03:45.740
Where did that come from?

03:46.940 --> 03:48.500
This is not a game.

03:48.950 --> 03:50.840
Dr. Feng is your target.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.860
We are your cannon fodder.

03:52.880 --> 03:53.770
you took advantage of us

03:53.960 --> 03:54.940
steal files

03:54.970 --> 03:55.940
From Dr. Feng's computer.

03:57.940 --> 03:58.620
OK

03:59.910 --> 04:01.680
you have a nose

04:01.710 --> 04:03.270
Now an agent.

04:04.460 --> 04:06.320
This is the charm of offline tasks.

04:07.190 --> 04:08.220
they make you feel

04:09.060 --> 04:10.700
You're really stealing information.

04:10.880 --> 04:11.770
Without further ado.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.510
This is a real secret theft!

04:14.900 --> 04:16.250
you deceived us

04:16.250 --> 04:17.089
In the name of gaming.

04:17.170 --> 04:18.700
I quit.

04:19.470 --> 04:21.240
Do you think you can give up?

04:24.930 --> 04:26.730
if this wasn't a real game

04:28.410 --> 04:30.230
Do you think you can come and go?

04:30.810 --> 04:32.250
as you wish?

04:38.620 --> 04:40.140
Think about it.

04:41.640 --> 04:42.659
Since this is

04:42.690 --> 04:43.680
real secret theft,

04:44.460 --> 04:45.500
this means

04:46.620 --> 04:47.860
you have become

04:47.900 --> 04:48.920
part of an espionage operation.

04:50.100 --> 04:51.580
Is it too late for you

04:52.350 --> 04:53.720
Exit the game now?

04:57.020 --> 04:58.020
Didn't you find anyone?

04:58.100 --> 04:59.340
Uploading files?

05:00.380 --> 05:02.700
You are his accomplice.

05:03.730 --> 05:05.140
without your help,

05:05.530 --> 05:07.050
How did the Trojan horse virus in USB come from?

05:07.480 --> 05:09.280
Infect that computer?

05:10.390 --> 05:11.450
You are threatening me.

05:11.730 --> 05:13.090
I'm talking about evidence.

05:14.690 --> 05:16.330
The game world has rules,

05:17.120 --> 05:18.290
Although there is a law

05:19.490 --> 05:20.340
In the real world.

05:20.660 --> 05:22.060
But what do you ask us to do?

05:22.210 --> 05:23.210
is illegal.

05:23.800 --> 05:24.840
that's right.

05:25.380 --> 05:26.920
But you did it anyway.

05:31.900 --> 05:33.190
We can go to the National Security Bureau

05:33.210 --> 05:33.980
explain the situation

05:34.230 --> 05:34.980
and report you.

05:35.640 --> 05:36.440
Put me in?

05:39.490 --> 05:40.850
Do you know who I am?

05:42.840 --> 05:44.210
you should think about it

05:45.030 --> 05:46.680
how many years

05:46.700 --> 05:47.730
Accomplices like you two will be sentenced.

05:49.610 --> 05:50.700
You don't know, right?

05:51.710 --> 05:52.900
I can tell you.

05:58.250 --> 05:59.560

05:59.700 --> 06:01.540
Suspected of stealing state secrets

06:01.980 --> 06:04.740
By stealing confidential documents.

06:05.160 --> 06:06.690
Convicted of espionage.

06:07.140 --> 06:10.260
You are sentenced to six years in prison according to law.

06:11.630 --> 06:16.230
【Please do not make loud noises】

06:12.640 --> 06:14.140
for me,

06:14.200 --> 06:15.720
There is no loss.

06:16.610 --> 06:17.700
there are many players

06:17.730 --> 06:19.050
Who can complete the task.

06:20.290 --> 06:21.430
But you two.

06:24.160 --> 06:25.850
Six years of youth disappeared like this.

06:26.390 --> 06:29.290
What else can you do after you get out?

06:33.060 --> 06:34.640
We don't know anything.

06:35.200 --> 06:36.710
We're just playing games.

06:37.060 --> 06:38.310
Of course, this is a game.

06:38.700 --> 06:40.430
I always say it's just a game.

06:40.950 --> 06:42.940
You are the ones who insist this is a spy game.

06:44.550 --> 06:46.400
As long as you keep playing

06:46.870 --> 06:48.390
It's always a game,

06:48.490 --> 06:50.140
Spy game.

06:55.590 --> 06:57.060
Do you have any other questions?

07:01.220 --> 07:02.010
No.

07:03.910 --> 07:04.740
I said

07:05.390 --> 07:07.330
There are rules in the game.

07:08.080 --> 07:09.780
you must be punished

07:10.860 --> 07:12.320
Because you have not completed your mission.

07:40.190 --> 07:42.170
【Resurrection or not】

07:55.670 --> 07:56.940
Do you believe what they say?

07:59.220 --> 08:00.030
What?

08:01.990 --> 08:03.080
We broke the law.

08:07.820 --> 08:08.800
I have no idea.

08:11.550 --> 08:12.280
sorry.

08:15.060 --> 08:16.610
Why are you apologizing?

08:18.050 --> 08:19.500
There must be something wrong with this game.

08:19.930 --> 08:20.570
Apart from,

08:20.590 --> 08:21.880
They came to me.

08:22.660 --> 08:23.580
you?

08:24.470 --> 08:25.570
biological samples

08:25.730 --> 08:26.670
and the research of Dr. Feng

08:26.700 --> 08:28.110
It's all about Bio Group.

08:28.130 --> 08:29.380
My dad works there.

08:29.440 --> 08:31.030
They framed me.

08:33.510 --> 08:35.030
This has nothing to do with you.

08:36.870 --> 08:38.299
I'm just playing games.

08:38.429 --> 08:39.559
I didn't steal state secrets.

08:39.850 --> 08:41.460
I believe this is a game.

08:43.179 --> 08:43.770
do you still think

08:43.770 --> 08:45.110
Is this just a game?

08:47.040 --> 08:49.420
What...what else could it be?

08:50.180 --> 08:51.050
we just brought

08:51.080 --> 08:52.200
fake sample

08:52.530 --> 08:53.250
and try to take some photos

08:53.300 --> 08:54.300
from someone's computer.

08:54.340 --> 08:55.650
But in the end we didn't get the photo.

08:56.420 --> 08:57.140
I won't admit it

08:57.180 --> 08:58.010
I was sinning anyway.

08:59.100 --> 09:00.090
tell people

09:00.130 --> 09:01.130
at the National Security Agency.

09:01.210 --> 09:02.460
Do you think they will believe you?

09:03.790 --> 09:04.580
why do we have to

09:04.580 --> 09:05.740
To the National Security Bureau?

09:07.220 --> 09:08.000
We are only

09:08.030 --> 09:09.310
play games.

09:21.530 --> 09:22.440
sorry.

09:24.250 --> 09:25.340
I know something is wrong

09:25.340 --> 09:26.640
With this game.

09:28.090 --> 09:29.530
But what can we do now?

09:30.440 --> 09:31.220
We can only bury our heads

09:31.240 --> 09:32.350
in the sand.

09:35.680 --> 09:36.660
Do not be afraid.

09:37.100 --> 09:37.700
I did it

09:37.700 --> 09:38.530
All on my own.

09:38.550 --> 09:39.660
They can't find you.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.140
Are you looking down on me?

09:42.590 --> 09:44.070
We are partners.

09:44.290 --> 09:45.980
if something happens

09:46.210 --> 09:46.980
I won't let you

09:47.010 --> 09:48.060
Bear it alone.

09:49.510 --> 09:50.470
What if I have to go to jail?

09:50.610 --> 09:51.950
Will you go with me?

09:53.560 --> 09:55.370
Can we avoid going to jail?

09:55.850 --> 09:56.650
do we have

09:56.650 --> 09:57.770
Another option?

09:59.490 --> 10:00.060
Yes.

10:00.760 --> 10:01.870
Keep playing the game.

10:02.540 --> 10:04.190
After we received the 100,000 yuan bonus,

10:04.310 --> 10:05.640
We can leave Jinhai.

10:06.280 --> 10:07.940
For this little money?

10:10.220 --> 10:12.280
If they really are spies

10:12.410 --> 10:14.170
They definitely won't let us go.

10:15.620 --> 10:16.300
if we have

10:16.300 --> 10:17.340
He did break the law,

10:17.650 --> 10:18.480
it's too late for us

10:18.500 --> 10:19.170
Do anything now.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.110
We might as well keep going.

10:21.950 --> 10:23.540
We've come this far.

10:23.650 --> 10:24.240
do you really think

10:24.240 --> 10:25.050
we can do it again

10:25.100 --> 10:25.980
Like in the game?

10:27.280 --> 10:28.620
Are you not afraid at all?

10:29.850 --> 10:30.850
I am.

10:31.650 --> 10:32.770
I'm scared

10:32.790 --> 10:33.710
in the game.

10:34.900 --> 10:35.670
but

10:35.700 --> 10:36.840
We were still shot dead by Boss Zhang.

10:37.090 --> 10:38.200
What's the point of being afraid?

10:40.670 --> 10:41.830
But we can't make any more mistakes

10:41.850 --> 10:42.770
And getting deeper and deeper!

10:44.160 --> 10:45.610
We can't do this, we can't do this.

10:45.870 --> 10:47.050
Then tell me. What should we do?

10:48.610 --> 10:49.430
I have no idea.

10:50.030 --> 10:51.260
Anyway,

10:51.300 --> 10:52.310
We can't play this game anymore.

10:53.440 --> 10:54.810
Regardless, our mission failed.

10:54.940 --> 10:55.900
We can give up.

10:57.640 --> 10:58.180
No.

We are only

10:59.530 --> 11:00.430

11:00.450 --> 11:01.070
why do we have to

11:01.130 --> 11:02.460
Surrender?

11:02.640 --> 11:03.400
you sound like

11:03.460 --> 11:04.580
We do sin.

11:05.110 --> 11:06.100
Apart from,

11:06.120 --> 11:08.030
Our debit cards are tied to accounts.

11:08.060 --> 11:08.980
Is it really possible

11:08.980 --> 11:09.890
What if we quit?

11:14.980 --> 11:17.390
forget it. Do what you want to do.

11:18.440 --> 11:19.630
where are you going?

11:19.780 --> 11:21.110
I want to be alone for a while.

Your bill, sir.

11:42.460 --> 11:43.130
Thanks.

11:43.210 --> 11:44.060
careful.

They are checking out and entering the elevator.

Search Shi Lei's home immediately.

12:39.920 --> 12:42.640
[Jinhai Weijing Hotel]

13:04.960 --> 13:07.050
Hello, is your last phone number 1426?

13:07.720 --> 13:08.260
Yes.

13:09.070 --> 13:10.410
Please fasten your seat belt.

13:10.490 --> 13:11.600
We're leaving.

13:19.300 --> 13:20.340
When we were at the izakaya

13:20.340 --> 13:21.420
I have begun to doubt Shi Lei.

13:22.030 --> 13:22.730
Really?

13:23.780 --> 13:24.650
do you remember

13:24.650 --> 13:26.060
What shoes does the cleaner wear?

13:29.100 --> 13:30.030
No.

13:34.430 --> 13:35.270
What a coincidence.

13:36.330 --> 13:37.510
that cleaner

13:37.720 --> 13:39.480
Also wearing a pair of black casual shoes.

13:41.380 --> 13:43.010
The cleaner changed in the underground shopping mall

13:43.310 --> 13:44.300
and escaped.

13:45.150 --> 13:46.130
He can change his shirt.

13:46.410 --> 13:47.800
He can change hats.

13:48.060 --> 13:49.460
But he doesn’t change shoes on purpose.

13:50.220 --> 13:52.210
Black casual shoes.

13:52.650 --> 13:53.100
perhaps

13:53.100 --> 13:54.100
It's just a coincidence.

13:54.220 --> 13:54.890
Yes.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.080
So from that moment on,

13:58.340 --> 13:59.460
I started to calculate

13:59.490 --> 14:00.320
How many coincidences

14:00.350 --> 14:01.380
It might happen to Shi Lei.

14:01.880 --> 14:03.090
What's the second coincidence?

14:04.350 --> 14:06.130
Shi Lei asked for sick leave

14:06.300 --> 14:07.660
The day the sample was lost.

14:08.410 --> 14:09.810
This would enable him to commit the crime.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.230
Another coincidence.

14:12.740 --> 14:13.570
What's the third one?

14:13.790 --> 14:14.830
do you remember

14:15.090 --> 14:16.560
That time when Yu Xiaoyue went to get the fake certificate

14:16.940 --> 14:17.930
And she is in danger,

14:17.980 --> 14:18.940
Shi Lei appeared?

26:53.450 --> 26:54.530
But there is nothing we can do.

26:54.660 --> 26:56.230

26:56.530 --> 26:57.020
this means

26:57.050 --> 26:58.140
She wanted to keep playing the game.

26:58.930 --> 27:00.530
No, it's not like that.

27:00.640 --> 27:01.060
How are you two doing?

27:01.090 --> 27:02.100
Know each other?

27:03.690 --> 27:04.550

27:04.570 --> 27:05.810
through this game.

27:06.160 --> 27:08.530
She returned to Jinhai from Los Angeles.

27:09.140 --> 27:09.940
This is a first for both of us

27:09.980 --> 27:11.250
Perform offline tasks.

27:25.620 --> 27:27.500
That's all what happened in Bangkok.

27:28.050 --> 27:29.120
I think you know it all.

27:31.080 --> 27:32.770
do you know

27:32.800 --> 27:33.640
Why is she playing this game?

27:35.290 --> 27:36.960
She just thinks this game is fun.

27:37.530 --> 27:39.770
But she cares about the prize.

27:39.910 --> 27:40.950
In fact, I am also very concerned about this.

28:23.690 --> 28:24.660

28:25.810 --> 28:26.730

28:27.050 --> 28:27.780

28:27.810 --> 28:28.620

28:38.600 --> 28:39.640
Boss Zhang.

28:40.680 --> 28:43.320
Boss Zhang’s role in the game

28:43.340 --> 28:44.380
It's a woman.

28:45.370 --> 28:46.510
I have no idea

28:46.530 --> 28:47.350
What she looks like in real life.

28:47.480 --> 28:49.270
but by talking to her

28:49.300 --> 28:50.060
In the game,

28:50.330 --> 28:50.860
I think

28:50.860 --> 28:51.940
She might actually be a woman.

28:52.170 --> 28:52.970
Why?

28:53.850 --> 28:55.500
Because she is more sensitive,

28:55.850 --> 28:57.770
And she spoke at a very steady pace.

28:58.130 --> 28:59.030

28:59.090 --> 28:59.940
His character is a soldier.

29:00.180 --> 29:01.270
He doesn’t talk much, but he’s a badass.

29:01.420 --> 29:02.140
he is that person

29:02.170 --> 29:03.100
Who kills us in the game.

29:03.600 --> 29:05.030
His level is level 50.

29:05.440 --> 29:06.360

29:06.390 --> 29:06.930

29:06.970 --> 29:08.420

29:08.440 --> 29:09.480

29:09.900 --> 29:10.610
No.

29:10.720 --> 29:11.870

29:12.050 --> 29:12.660

29:12.760 --> 29:13.760
It's so lifelike.

29:14.010 --> 29:14.700
It's just like

29:14.770 --> 29:15.690
I'm really an agent

29:15.940 --> 29:16.860
and completely immersed in it

29:16.860 --> 29:18.330
In the world of agents.

29:18.790 --> 29:19.790
These are not excuses.

29:22.330 --> 29:23.400
And your confession,

29:23.620 --> 29:25.980
You are now working for a spy.

29:26.510 --> 29:27.900
Well, you can't blame that on me.

29:28.220 --> 29:29.450
I'm a victim too.

I won't

29:31.860 --> 29:32.660
Did those things.

29:32.850 --> 29:33.530
But the fact is that you have

29:33.570 --> 29:34.420
Committed secret theft.

29:34.950 --> 29:36.370

29:36.480 --> 29:37.420

Use this as an excuse to get out of jail,

29:38.860 --> 29:40.290
no one can prove

29:40.290 --> 29:41.180

I want it immediately

29:44.880 --> 29:45.950
It was you who stopped me.

29:46.010 --> 29:46.980
I could have caught him.

29:47.180 --> 29:48.060
Then it's our fault

29:48.090 --> 29:49.090
Do you work for a spy?

29:49.230 --> 29:50.860
Of course, I was wrong. I admit.

29:50.880 --> 29:51.490
but you

29:51.490 --> 29:52.810
You should have your own plans, right?

29:53.460 --> 29:54.220
This must be your plan

29:54.220 --> 29:55.450
You didn't catch the guy.

29:55.780 --> 29:56.750
you stopped me

29:56.790 --> 29:58.370
Because you don't want me to mess up your plans.

30:00.700 --> 30:01.490

30:02.250 --> 30:02.900
then you should know

I will definitely contact Shi Lei again.

36:20.160 --> 36:21.620
If there's really something wrong with her

36:21.640 --> 36:23.030
She would definitely expose herself.

36:24.050 --> 36:25.010
Let's wait and see.

36:33.450 --> 36:34.500

36:53.770 --> 36:54.440
Put her through.

37:00.730 --> 37:01.260
Hello?

37:16.540 --> 37:17.350
Shi Lei left.

37:18.820 --> 37:19.580
Did you finish it?

37:19.820 --> 37:21.250
Yeah, put it on my label.

37:21.570 --> 37:22.040
OK

37:26.170 --> 37:29.230
[fish leaping]

37:45.550 --> 37:46.610
At least the person who called him

37:46.690 --> 37:47.460
Not Jiahui.

37:48.950 --> 37:49.680

He disappeared into the blind spot of surveillance.

38:52.210 --> 38:53.270
Follow-up whereabouts.
