03:52.310 --> 03:53.120
why are you here

03:53.590 --> 03:54.150
have they gone

04:13.750 --> 04:14.720
Why are they both here?

04:17.920 --> 04:18.720
Don't worry about them

04:18.829 --> 04:19.600
Focus on the target first

04:25.070 --> 04:26.190
Isn't she your good friend?

04:26.750 --> 04:27.680
why are you following her

04:28.390 --> 04:29.720
You haven't answered my question yet

04:30.000 --> 04:31.510
I will go to your company to find you

04:32.310 --> 04:33.240
Saw you following her

04:33.830 --> 04:34.630
I followed here

04:35.040 --> 04:35.800
What do you want from me?

04:37.950 --> 04:38.430
I'd like to see you

04:38.510 --> 04:39.310
How are you

04:42.720 --> 04:43.360
I'm fine

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Then why are you following her?

04:45.430 --> 04:46.070
This is our company

04:46.190 --> 04:47.159
Task assigned by the boss

04:48.480 --> 04:49.480
What kind of mission is this?

04:49.950 --> 04:50.510
This is our company

04:50.630 --> 04:51.430
internal matters

04:51.680 --> 04:53.070
Your boss asked you to check

04:54.000 --> 04:55.360
It was someone from Yewu who asked you to check it.

04:55.560 --> 04:56.600
we have broken up

04:59.680 --> 05:00.750
All my things from now on

05:01.360 --> 05:02.720
It has nothing to do with you

05:15.120 --> 05:15.510
Hello

05:16.360 --> 05:17.000
how is everything

05:17.510 --> 05:18.510
Detective Xiao Yao

05:20.720 --> 05:21.600
Sorry Mr. Zhou

05:22.360 --> 05:23.070
I didn't keep up

05:23.950 --> 05:24.480
It doesn't matter

05:25.160 --> 05:26.040
Find a place to wait for me

05:26.470 --> 05:27.040
I'll come and pick you up

05:27.190 --> 05:27.600
good

05:28.190 --> 05:29.040
let's have dinner tonight

05:30.240 --> 05:31.430
It was really Zhou Zheyi who asked you to check it.

05:37.310 --> 05:37.870
never again

05:37.920 --> 05:38.800
Getting involved in my affairs

05:39.360 --> 05:39.950
May I

06:22.830 --> 06:23.680
The address she wrote when she joined the company

06:23.750 --> 06:24.310
Not here

06:25.120 --> 06:25.800
She deliberately concealed it

06:25.800 --> 06:26.430
own address

06:26.830 --> 06:27.830
Do you want to follow up and have a look?

06:28.160 --> 06:28.560
Need not

06:28.950 --> 06:30.120
I don't know what's going on inside.

06:30.310 --> 06:31.120
Don't alarm her yet

06:37.310 --> 06:37.800
Let's go

08:00.750 --> 08:01.510
I can only say

08:01.720 --> 08:03.190
your choice and most

08:03.190 --> 08:04.870
People who work in information technology are different

08:05.830 --> 08:06.510
different options

08:06.510 --> 08:08.070
is a different attitude and understanding

08:08.190 --> 08:09.560
results

08:35.630 --> 08:36.200
Mr. Zhou

08:38.960 --> 08:39.630
Today's things

08:39.669 --> 08:40.669
I didn't do it well

08:41.669 --> 08:42.120
get off work

08:42.669 --> 08:43.440
Not to mention work

08:44.150 --> 08:44.840
enjoy it

08:45.150 --> 08:46.000
gourmet food

08:48.000 --> 08:48.750
If this matter

08:48.750 --> 08:50.030
Shiqi really did it

08:50.750 --> 08:51.600
you plan to

08:52.080 --> 08:52.840
what to do with her

08:53.510 --> 08:54.320
What about me?

08:54.510 --> 08:56.240
I definitely don’t want to be blackmailed

08:57.440 --> 08:57.840
but

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
I don't want this to get serious either.

08:59.510 --> 09:00.150
If she is found

09:00.240 --> 09:01.320
What about the specific address?

09:02.360 --> 09:03.270
I'll talk to her

09:04.200 --> 09:05.630
If she agrees to negotiate a settlement

09:06.240 --> 09:07.550
I know the past things

09:08.200 --> 09:09.000
Let bygones be bygones

09:12.270 --> 09:13.150
Thank you Mr. Zhou

09:13.960 --> 09:15.080
Can give her a chance

09:16.150 --> 09:16.910
I'll bring you here

09:17.030 --> 09:18.080
I just want you to be happy

09:19.240 --> 09:19.910
Let me tell you

09:21.000 --> 09:22.200
Every time I was unhappy before

09:22.240 --> 09:23.270
I will call some good friends

09:23.320 --> 09:24.200
Come over and eat together

09:24.390 --> 09:24.790
real

09:25.270 --> 09:26.630
Hot and spicy

09:27.910 --> 09:29.030
I was sweating after eating

09:29.480 --> 09:30.790
Really happy

09:32.030 --> 09:32.910
I thought it looked like you

09:32.910 --> 09:34.120
Such successful people

09:34.630 --> 09:35.840
I don’t know how to eat from roadside stalls

09:36.840 --> 09:38.440
Isn't this outright prejudice?

09:40.960 --> 09:42.240
In fact, I come less often now.

09:43.390 --> 09:44.240
Not because of anything else

09:45.320 --> 09:45.720
It's because before

09:45.840 --> 09:46.670
Where are those buddies?

09:47.360 --> 09:48.120
get married get married

09:48.480 --> 09:49.480
Those who have children have children

09:50.200 --> 09:51.270
It's not appropriate for me to call people out now.

09:51.670 --> 09:52.510
I can't eat alone

09:52.630 --> 09:53.120
right

09:53.790 --> 09:54.390
You eat it

09:56.270 --> 09:57.080
I think Mr. Zhou

09:57.390 --> 09:57.960
people like you

09:57.960 --> 09:59.240
Will never be out of date

10:00.390 --> 10:00.960
because you think

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
I've always been very ahead of my time.

10:02.750 --> 10:03.440
for example

10:03.870 --> 10:05.080
when you were in college

10:05.320 --> 10:06.120
Already have something to ask for

10:06.150 --> 10:07.480
Founder of Q&A website

10:07.630 --> 10:08.270
that kind of thought

10:09.000 --> 10:10.360
and persist until now

10:10.390 --> 10:11.150
Make it so big

10:11.630 --> 10:12.720
But it will definitely face

10:12.750 --> 10:13.960
many important decisions

10:14.200 --> 10:15.600
You made the right choice

10:16.550 --> 10:17.200
Very powerful

10:18.750 --> 10:20.150
my past history

10:20.360 --> 10:21.550
I understand very clearly

10:23.030 --> 10:24.080
I'm not following you

10:24.200 --> 10:25.960
Did you go to Thailand for an interview?

10:26.320 --> 10:27.390
Also talk to the media

10:27.550 --> 10:29.120
Adapted some outlines and so on

10:29.510 --> 10:30.910
That’s pretty much all I understand.

10:31.870 --> 10:32.600
That's because I'm overthinking

10:32.750 --> 10:33.120
I thought you

10:33.200 --> 10:34.200
Did you do some research on me?

10:39.870 --> 10:40.550
but

10:41.550 --> 10:42.790
There are many things in this

10:42.960 --> 10:44.000
I'm quite curious

10:44.550 --> 10:45.240
What's up

10:47.510 --> 10:49.200
This website was originally

10:49.320 --> 10:50.720
When I can’t do it anymore

10:51.390 --> 10:52.600
I remember almost

10:53.440 --> 10:54.550
Two years, maybe

10:55.080 --> 10:56.320
You haven't found financing yet

10:57.150 --> 10:58.600
Then how did you bring Zheyue with you?

10:59.200 --> 11:00.510
Keep at it

11:06.320 --> 11:06.910
I'm sorry

11:07.550 --> 11:08.480
Are employees

11:09.030 --> 11:10.360
You shouldn't ask these questions

11:12.390 --> 11:13.510
You said you're off work now?

11:13.750 --> 11:14.200
the two of us

11:14.320 --> 11:15.510
Sit here and eat food stalls

11:15.960 --> 11:16.440
Where else is there?

11:16.550 --> 11:17.630
There are differences between superiors and subordinates

11:19.150 --> 11:19.960
Didn't answer you?

11:20.030 --> 11:21.320
How do I want to answer

11:23.630 --> 11:24.480
I was young then

11:25.480 --> 11:26.240
There are so many ideas

11:26.390 --> 11:27.630
I do whatever comes to my mind

11:28.150 --> 11:29.360
Tell the truth Zheyue

11:30.270 --> 11:30.910
I did not do that

11:31.030 --> 11:31.840
only one project

11:33.080 --> 11:34.550
You have also developed other projects

11:35.270 --> 11:35.670
right

11:36.630 --> 11:38.200
It's just that Zheyue is lucky

11:38.360 --> 11:39.720
is the only one who survived

11:41.150 --> 11:42.870
What about other projects?

11:43.240 --> 11:43.720
died

11:44.480 --> 11:45.150
Or halfway

11:45.200 --> 11:46.000
I sold it

11:46.670 --> 11:48.080
Then I use the money from selling it

11:48.320 --> 11:49.030
go

11:49.240 --> 11:50.910
Maintain the operation of the entire Zheyue?

11:51.480 --> 11:52.150
What other projects

11:52.360 --> 11:53.720
Also like Zheyue

11:54.270 --> 11:55.030
Q&A website

11:55.480 --> 11:56.030
no no

11:56.270 --> 11:57.790
There are other different projects

11:58.480 --> 11:59.240
I don’t just make websites

11:59.390 --> 12:00.360
I still play games

12:01.600 --> 12:02.910
Have you also made games?

12:03.600 --> 12:04.030
so amazing

12:04.200 --> 12:05.360
What game? Can you tell me?

12:05.630 --> 12:06.600
Maybe I've played it

12:06.840 --> 12:07.480
impossible

12:08.120 --> 12:09.720
I made a prototype at that time

12:10.960 --> 12:11.750
Made a test version

12:11.960 --> 12:12.960
Not officially launched yet

12:14.360 --> 12:15.550
What is that creativity?

12:16.000 --> 12:16.320
you say it

12:16.480 --> 12:17.550
Let me give you advice

12:17.840 --> 12:18.600
What if it works?

12:18.750 --> 12:19.270
Too cliche

12:19.510 --> 12:20.600
I definitely won't say it

12:21.030 --> 12:21.910
Say what I am in your heart

12:22.030 --> 12:23.440
Wouldn’t the glorious image be gone?

12:24.910 --> 12:25.360
OK

12:26.240 --> 12:27.240
If you don’t say it, don’t say it.

12:32.080 --> 12:32.790
Zhou Shiqi is

12:32.910 --> 12:34.320
The player in the game

12:34.720 --> 12:35.200
crow

12:35.670 --> 12:36.870
At first I was just skeptical

12:37.320 --> 12:38.150
But Zhou Zheyi

12:38.320 --> 12:39.480
Let Yao Yao also investigate her

12:39.910 --> 12:40.480
I think it's possible

12:40.630 --> 12:41.390
It's very big

12:41.910 --> 12:43.320
Even if Shiqi is not a crow

12:43.510 --> 12:45.200
But she must have something to do with Crow

12:46.870 --> 12:48.080
So what is Zhou Zheyi’s identity?

12:48.870 --> 12:49.790
I doubt Zhou Zheyi

12:49.960 --> 12:51.150
Just from Zhou Shiqi's hands

12:51.320 --> 12:52.000
People who buy evidence

12:52.360 --> 12:53.270
He is Mr. Z

12:53.960 --> 12:54.550
Probably

12:56.550 --> 12:57.960
What does Zhou Shiqi have in her hands?

12:58.000 --> 12:59.080
What's the secret of Zhe Yue?

12:59.440 --> 13:00.670
Be sure to find out as soon as possible

13:01.320 --> 13:02.480
As long as the thing is in her hands

13:02.670 --> 13:03.480
She will be in danger

13:04.030 --> 13:04.870
so i suggest

13:05.270 --> 13:06.480
Inquire with her as soon as possible

13:06.670 --> 13:07.870
Let her cooperate with our work

13:08.790 --> 13:10.230
But she is not a suspect

13:10.720 --> 13:11.510
When asking

13:11.790 --> 13:13.080
Be sure to pay attention to the methods

13:13.480 --> 13:14.240
abide by rules and regulations

13:14.480 --> 13:14.910
clear

13:15.790 --> 13:17.480
But this matter is still needed

13:17.600 --> 13:18.390
carried out in secret

13:19.240 --> 13:20.630
I doubt this boss Zhang

13:21.200 --> 13:22.320
Already involved in it

13:22.750 --> 13:23.440
Boss Zhang

13:32.750 --> 13:33.440
So fast

13:34.630 --> 13:35.390
hard to use

13:36.080 --> 13:37.030
Neither does Mr. Yu.

13:37.120 --> 13:37.910
Put it at your place

13:38.790 --> 13:39.870
But smart people

13:40.440 --> 13:41.670
Often not so obedient

13:43.000 --> 13:43.550
Do not worry

13:44.670 --> 13:45.720
I will deal with it

13:46.550 --> 13:47.480
Just these three sentences

13:50.910 --> 13:52.030
From the perspective of ambient sound

13:52.960 --> 13:54.080
I infer that this boss Zhang

13:54.320 --> 13:55.390
It should be the same as in the game

13:55.550 --> 13:56.630
someone is meeting

13:57.480 --> 13:58.120
second sentence

13:58.750 --> 13:59.320
hard to use

13:59.840 --> 14:00.550
Neither does Mr. Yu.

14:00.630 --> 14:01.720
Arrange it at your place

14:02.630 --> 14:04.200
If this person is Yao Yao

14:04.910 --> 14:06.150
Arrange it at your place

14:07.080 --> 14:08.000
That’s Zhou Zheyi

14:08.790 --> 14:10.510
If this inference is true

14:11.080 --> 14:11.750
So the first sentence

14:12.080 --> 14:12.790
So fast

14:13.750 --> 14:14.720
It should be referring to Yao Yao

14:14.910 --> 14:15.720
recent tasks

14:16.030 --> 14:17.150
Found Zhou Shiqi

14:18.360 --> 14:19.440
Recording time point

14:20.000 --> 14:20.630
Discovered with Yao Yao

14:20.750 --> 14:22.600
Zhou Shiqi’s time is consistent

14:23.600 --> 14:24.200
The last sentence

14:24.960 --> 14:25.600
do not worry

14:26.150 --> 14:27.120
I will deal with it

14:27.910 --> 14:29.240
This is obviously Zhou Zheyi

14:29.360 --> 14:30.630
I’m asking Boss Zhang for a favor.

14:30.960 --> 14:31.750
let her handle it

14:32.670 --> 14:33.630
Things about Zhou Shiqi

14:34.550 --> 14:35.150
possible

14:36.030 --> 14:37.000
If Tianyang makes this judgment

14:37.080 --> 14:37.720
is correct

14:38.120 --> 14:38.790
Must be as soon as possible

14:39.030 --> 14:40.120
Get in touch with Zhou Shiqi

14:40.480 --> 14:41.510
Be sure to do it in secret

14:42.840 --> 14:43.320
clear

14:43.840 --> 14:44.910
Tianyang continues to stare at

14:44.960 --> 14:45.720
Boss Zhang’s movements

14:46.030 --> 14:46.720
So clear

15:01.270 --> 15:02.080
Go back and have a good rest

15:02.630 --> 15:03.720
Be careful on the road, Mr. Zhou

15:18.600 --> 15:19.120
Yao Yao

15:23.360 --> 15:24.840
It seems like you guys get along pretty well.

15:25.200 --> 15:25.870
you follow me

15:26.790 --> 15:27.600
How can I be so boring?

15:28.270 --> 15:28.910
I watched Zhou Zheyi

15:28.960 --> 15:29.600
all interviews

15:29.960 --> 15:30.360
I think he is

15:30.440 --> 15:31.120
Very problematic

15:34.030 --> 15:35.270
What does this have to do with me?

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
He has other plans for you

15:41.870 --> 15:42.510
I'll go up and talk

15:43.000 --> 15:43.960
I promise to leave as soon as I finish speaking.

16:02.720 --> 16:03.150
Say it

16:05.000 --> 16:06.120
Your history with Zhou Zheyi

16:06.360 --> 16:07.270
You should have some understanding

16:11.510 --> 16:12.390
It doesn’t matter if you don’t understand

16:12.840 --> 16:13.550
Let me introduce you

16:15.080 --> 16:16.120
In his early days in the United States

16:16.270 --> 16:17.550
When starting a Q&A website

16:18.270 --> 16:19.150
I almost can't do it anymore

16:20.150 --> 16:20.870
But suddenly

16:21.120 --> 16:22.080
A large amount of financing came

16:22.550 --> 16:23.510
bring him back to life

16:24.750 --> 16:26.110
Why does capital take a fancy to him?

16:27.630 --> 16:28.790
I watched many interviews with him

16:29.550 --> 16:30.440
He has this history

16:30.840 --> 16:32.200
The description has always been very vague

16:33.630 --> 16:34.550
According to my survey

16:35.240 --> 16:35.630
At that time

16:35.840 --> 16:37.550
A small Q&A website like this

16:37.790 --> 16:39.240
It’s not just Zhou Zhe’s team

16:40.270 --> 16:41.440
But why can he get up?

16:46.320 --> 16:47.150
Can you tell me the key points?

16:51.030 --> 16:51.840
I doubt

16:52.240 --> 16:53.670
Supporters behind Zhou Zheyi

16:54.480 --> 16:55.200
It's night fog

17:03.480 --> 17:04.640
I think you think too much

17:06.000 --> 17:06.829
So do you have evidence?

17:07.440 --> 17:08.030
Think about it

17:08.310 --> 17:08.750
you go to thailand

17:08.920 --> 17:10.109
Was he sent there temporarily?

17:10.640 --> 17:11.920
Something happened as soon as you got there

17:12.480 --> 17:13.510
This is definitely not a coincidence

17:18.589 --> 17:19.790
You've been in contact with him for so long

17:20.480 --> 17:21.640
Just no feeling at all

17:31.270 --> 17:32.790
If you really doubt him

17:33.110 --> 17:34.480
You can report him to the National Security Bureau

17:35.110 --> 17:35.790
no need to tell me

17:37.880 --> 17:38.880
You can doubt all this

17:38.920 --> 17:39.790
It's all my imagination

17:40.720 --> 17:41.920
But I still have to remind you

17:43.440 --> 17:44.030
Why

17:45.400 --> 17:46.110
Because I can't forget

17:48.240 --> 17:49.680
Your desperate look on the boat

17:53.920 --> 17:55.240
You told me when you were on the boat

17:56.200 --> 17:56.720
if i were earlier

17:56.750 --> 17:57.640
Just tell you

17:59.350 --> 18:00.920
Your desperate eyes at that time

18:01.830 --> 18:02.790
i can never forget

18:04.830 --> 18:06.000
if i told you earlier

18:07.510 --> 18:08.240
You can still be saved

18:19.590 --> 18:20.400
A visitor comes to visit

18:20.510 --> 18:21.000
Who is it?

18:27.310 --> 18:27.920
Zhou Diyi

18:28.400 --> 18:28.960
You go in first

18:36.350 --> 18:37.200
A visitor comes to visit

18:47.000 --> 18:47.920
A visitor comes to visit

18:48.550 --> 18:49.030
Coming

18:56.440 --> 18:56.790
Yao Yao

18:57.070 --> 18:57.680
Mr. Zhou

18:58.200 --> 18:59.200
How did you come up?

19:00.030 --> 19:01.030
I left my sunglasses in my car

19:01.030 --> 19:01.720
I'll bring it to you

19:03.030 --> 19:04.070
Thanks for the trouble

19:05.110 --> 19:07.110
Well, I was just getting ready to take a shower.

19:07.270 --> 19:08.310
I won't invite you in

19:08.440 --> 19:09.550
I can't bother you anymore

19:09.750 --> 19:10.440
See you at the company tomorrow

19:11.030 --> 19:11.750
See you tomorrow, Mr. Zhou

19:11.880 --> 19:12.350
Bye-Bye

19:28.200 --> 19:28.750
gone

19:29.720 --> 19:30.750
How does he know where you live?

19:32.680 --> 19:34.070
It's all in the employee information, right?

19:37.000 --> 19:38.030
It's not good for him to see me

19:38.830 --> 19:40.510
Tangled up with ex-boyfriend

19:46.720 --> 19:47.640
You're done

19:48.590 --> 19:49.640
thanks for your reminder

19:50.510 --> 19:51.000
come this far

19:51.110 --> 19:52.110
It's my own choice

19:55.030 --> 19:55.830
You should go back early

19:56.960 --> 19:57.310
Yao Yao

19:57.510 --> 19:58.590
I will think clearly

19:59.440 --> 20:00.590
what should i do next

20:03.310 --> 20:04.110
What I want to say is

20:05.070 --> 20:05.750
Just in case he

20:05.790 --> 20:06.680
I haven’t left yet downstairs.

20:07.400 --> 20:08.590
I'd better go down later.

20:11.440 --> 20:12.880
Be alert at all times

20:30.160 --> 20:30.790
Will use it tomorrow

20:30.960 --> 20:31.880
Are you all ready?

20:33.750 --> 20:34.310
Don't worry, sister

20:34.720 --> 20:35.350
All ready

21:36.030 --> 21:36.680
beef rice

21:38.720 --> 21:39.270
Come, I'll come

21:39.440 --> 21:40.350
Come on, give it to me

21:41.680 --> 21:42.030
good

21:42.200 --> 21:42.440
Thanks

21:42.510 --> 21:43.110
welcome

21:44.000 --> 21:44.550
Thank you, I'll pay you back

21:44.750 --> 21:45.680
to myself

21:48.750 --> 21:49.310
Tianyang

21:49.830 --> 21:50.240
Come, come, come

21:50.240 --> 21:50.720
uncle

21:52.640 --> 21:53.160
that's what you said

21:53.270 --> 21:54.070
That izakaya?

21:54.310 --> 21:54.720
yes

21:55.030 --> 21:55.830
You also know this place

21:57.110 --> 21:57.590
something to eat

21:58.590 --> 21:59.160
Pork chop rice bar

21:59.830 --> 22:00.200
good

22:00.310 --> 22:00.790
Okay, thank you

22:00.830 --> 22:01.240
Come on

22:01.510 --> 22:02.160
Let me introduce it to you

22:02.480 --> 22:03.550
This is ours

22:03.880 --> 22:05.310
Heavyweight researchers

22:05.510 --> 22:06.160
A pork chop with rice

22:06.160 --> 22:06.750
Dr. Bian

22:07.440 --> 22:08.240
You sit, you sit, you sit

22:08.590 --> 22:09.830
My nephew Gao Tianyang

22:10.720 --> 22:11.160
Nice to meet you

22:11.400 --> 22:11.960
Nice to meet you

22:12.000 --> 22:13.160
Come and sit in Tianyang

22:14.880 --> 22:16.000
I didn't expect to meet you here.

22:16.240 --> 22:17.680
Yes, what a coincidence

22:21.510 --> 22:22.480
Why did you start eating again?

22:25.000 --> 22:27.480
This period is quite stressful.

22:28.070 --> 22:30.200
It’s not easy for a long-time smoker to quit

22:31.790 --> 22:32.880
I've quit for a long time

22:32.920 --> 22:33.440
OK

22:33.720 --> 22:34.550
stronger than you

22:35.400 --> 22:36.270
You didn't look at me two months ago

22:36.270 --> 22:37.160
Didn't smoke much?

22:37.400 --> 22:38.790
That's what I prove

22:40.070 --> 22:40.830
Me and your uncle Bian

22:40.920 --> 22:42.030
We both quit together

22:42.350 --> 22:43.160
Mutual supervision

22:45.200 --> 22:45.720
Dr. Bian

22:46.270 --> 22:46.680
you

22:47.240 --> 22:47.790
You quit too

22:49.550 --> 22:51.030
with your uncle

22:51.310 --> 22:51.830
Always eating sweets

22:52.200 --> 22:54.110
I'm almost going to have diabetes.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.200
You just love sweets

22:56.240 --> 22:56.680
do you know

22:56.750 --> 22:58.000
It has nothing to do with me

22:59.200 --> 23:00.240
I'll try whatever it tastes

23:01.160 --> 23:01.830
You don't smoke

23:01.960 --> 23:03.880
What can I eat to quit smoking? Really?

23:10.920 --> 23:11.640
Boss lady

23:13.070 --> 23:14.200
Another sushi

23:14.590 --> 23:15.110
Pack

23:16.590 --> 23:17.200
Lao Huang

23:17.590 --> 23:18.030
Tianyang

23:18.240 --> 23:18.960
Excuse me

23:19.350 --> 23:20.070
I am busy

23:20.310 --> 23:21.350
I won’t accompany you anymore

23:21.590 --> 23:22.750
I'll just take a few bites

23:22.920 --> 23:23.920
well

23:23.960 --> 23:25.070
If you have something to do, go on your own.

23:25.270 --> 23:26.350
As long as Tianyang is with me, that's fine

23:26.590 --> 23:27.110
good

23:27.240 --> 23:27.790
You eat, you eat

23:28.920 --> 23:29.830
Eat quickly, don't let it get cold

23:30.160 --> 23:30.790
Etc., etc

23:31.030 --> 23:31.640
Waiting for your meal to come

23:31.720 --> 23:32.480
Let's eat together

23:33.270 --> 23:33.830
this

24:00.550 --> 24:01.640
Thank you for coming. Please walk slowly.

24:02.400 --> 24:03.000
Thanks

24:07.750 --> 24:08.480
your unit

24:09.400 --> 24:10.550
It's not even close to here

24:10.920 --> 24:11.400
How can you

24:11.640 --> 24:12.680
Find this place

24:13.590 --> 24:15.030
I used to work around here

24:15.440 --> 24:16.350
Have eaten here several times

24:18.160 --> 24:18.920
Around here

24:19.030 --> 24:20.110
Just this store

24:20.270 --> 24:20.960
The taste is okay

24:22.680 --> 24:23.960
Especially this boss lady

24:24.510 --> 24:25.070
that's really

24:25.270 --> 24:26.790
People who cook food seriously

24:29.640 --> 24:30.590
Are you familiar with her?

24:32.720 --> 24:34.070
The boss lady is very interesting

24:34.680 --> 24:35.880
Kind and sensible

24:36.640 --> 24:37.480
don't you feel it

24:38.640 --> 24:39.680
I really didn't notice

24:39.920 --> 24:41.070
I'll pay attention next time

24:41.920 --> 24:43.000
How many times have you been here before?

24:43.160 --> 24:44.590
They all came here blindfolded.

24:47.350 --> 24:49.880
I am attracted to this kind of gentle and virtuous mother type

24:50.350 --> 24:51.240
She is not my type

24:52.310 --> 24:53.750
So what type is your cup of tea?

24:54.160 --> 24:55.240
Dominatrix type

24:55.790 --> 24:56.240
no

24:57.400 --> 24:57.880
I find

24:58.030 --> 24:59.350
Why do you still talk about women?

25:00.110 --> 25:00.830
let me tell you

25:01.510 --> 25:03.400
Don't underestimate the boss lady

25:05.400 --> 25:07.070
From my experience of getting to know people

25:07.920 --> 25:09.720
This girl is not simple

25:10.480 --> 25:11.350
Don't look at her

25:11.720 --> 25:13.480
Gentle and virtuous on the surface

25:14.000 --> 25:14.590
actually

25:14.640 --> 25:16.070
She's not that kind of person at all

25:17.240 --> 25:17.960
You can see this

25:18.160 --> 25:18.830
of course

25:20.070 --> 25:21.200
Just your personality

25:21.640 --> 25:22.310
future

25:22.790 --> 25:23.830
Who can hold who?

25:24.070 --> 25:25.070
I don’t know yet

25:25.160 --> 25:26.070
What do we have?

25:26.110 --> 25:27.160
It's manageable

25:27.310 --> 25:28.070
What if

25:28.590 --> 25:29.440
What happens after that

25:29.680 --> 25:30.590
Who can say for sure?

25:30.720 --> 25:31.110
Okay, okay

25:31.350 --> 25:31.590
uncle

25:31.750 --> 25:33.000
Stop talking about my boss's wife.

25:33.750 --> 25:34.110
Even you

25:34.200 --> 25:35.350
Sometimes I can't see clearly

25:36.110 --> 25:37.160
Isn't that normal?

25:37.880 --> 25:39.070
They are all thousand-year-old foxes

25:39.510 --> 25:40.030
I eat salt

25:40.200 --> 25:41.680
It’s more food than you eat

25:42.110 --> 25:43.590
Want to see something clearly

25:43.830 --> 25:45.240
You still have to practice and practice again

25:46.070 --> 25:46.790
Accepted

25:49.350 --> 25:49.830
correct

25:50.350 --> 25:51.590
How are Zicheng and Yao Yao doing?

25:52.030 --> 25:52.590
Really divided

25:53.510 --> 25:54.640
They both seem to be

25:54.960 --> 25:56.270
What do you mean it seems to be?

25:56.400 --> 25:56.790
Come

25:58.200 --> 25:58.830
Pork Chop Rice

26:00.240 --> 26:00.750
thank you

26:06.110 --> 26:06.680
I really think

26:06.790 --> 26:08.160
You two are a good match

26:08.830 --> 26:09.510
Eat yours

26:09.680 --> 26:10.640
Stop minding your own business.

26:13.590 --> 26:14.750
Boss, I'm going to stock up.

26:15.200 --> 26:15.750
good

26:28.550 --> 26:29.110
I'll give you a piece

26:29.680 --> 26:31.200
No need for me to wander around

26:31.510 --> 26:32.440
Just around the corner and there you are

26:32.920 --> 26:33.400
Then I'm leaving

26:33.830 --> 26:34.830
What's that?

26:35.510 --> 26:36.480
It's rare for you to have leisure time

26:36.720 --> 26:37.160
next time

26:37.350 --> 26:38.510
Ask Zicheng to come over with you

26:39.160 --> 26:39.440
OK

26:39.720 --> 26:40.070
good

26:40.240 --> 26:40.830
Drive slowly

26:41.270 --> 26:41.750
Bye-Bye

27:14.240 --> 27:15.030
Your bugs have arrived

27:16.070 --> 27:17.110
Okay, go there right away

30:19.160 --> 30:20.480
We have a situation we want to know about

30:20.640 --> 30:21.350
need your cooperation

30:23.160 --> 30:23.590
good

30:33.680 --> 30:34.350
we want to know

30:34.510 --> 30:35.440
Zheyue's situation

30:38.440 --> 30:39.880
I have resigned from Zheyue

30:40.070 --> 30:41.440
I don't know what else I can help you with.

30:42.110 --> 30:42.590
Shi Qi

30:44.110 --> 30:44.750
if we didn't

30:44.880 --> 30:45.960
Find out your details

30:46.750 --> 30:48.200
I won't come to you rashly

30:49.000 --> 30:49.880
What do you want to ask

30:50.790 --> 30:51.270
About Zheyue

30:51.310 --> 30:52.590
Leakage of user information

30:54.510 --> 30:56.200
I'm not sure about this

30:58.110 --> 30:58.720
Then let's talk

30:58.830 --> 31:00.200
Agent mission game

31:01.400 --> 31:02.720
How you look in the game

31:03.030 --> 31:04.200
Not as innocent as now

31:06.350 --> 31:06.960
crow

31:09.400 --> 31:10.750
Am I breaking the law by playing games?

31:11.030 --> 31:11.790
It depends on how you play

31:11.790 --> 31:12.750
what game is it

31:13.750 --> 31:15.030
Selling information online

31:15.640 --> 31:16.160
Do you think the network

31:16.240 --> 31:17.110
It's a place outside the law

31:18.350 --> 31:19.790
I just rely on my own ability

31:20.110 --> 31:21.750
Digging up some dirt in the industry

31:22.480 --> 31:24.240
What does this have to do with national security?

31:24.750 --> 31:25.440
Because of these dirty things

31:25.590 --> 31:26.830
Matters of national security

31:27.400 --> 31:28.270
This is not just

31:28.400 --> 31:29.270
An ordinary crime

31:30.350 --> 31:30.880
you have been

31:31.030 --> 31:32.310
Overseas espionage organizations are targeting

31:32.480 --> 31:33.110
very likely to become

31:33.160 --> 31:34.000
their victims

31:34.160 --> 31:34.920
This has something to do with a spy organization

31:35.030 --> 31:36.070
What does it matter?

31:36.310 --> 31:37.160
That's up to you

31:38.240 --> 31:38.720
What's in your hands

31:38.790 --> 31:39.640
what did you take

31:43.960 --> 31:45.400
It's a video I recorded

31:46.510 --> 31:47.200
What video

31:51.000 --> 31:52.240
Server room in Zheyue

31:52.440 --> 31:53.440
There is a server

31:54.030 --> 31:54.960
always locked

31:56.400 --> 31:57.440
I feel strange

31:58.750 --> 31:59.550
Since I joined the company

31:59.720 --> 32:01.000
It's always been locked here

32:02.640 --> 32:03.480
I'm from the technical department

32:03.590 --> 32:04.590
Find out there

32:05.440 --> 32:06.480
Said the machine inside was broken

32:06.790 --> 32:07.720
No more use

32:09.110 --> 32:10.070
I'm very strange

32:11.200 --> 32:12.070
In this case

32:12.510 --> 32:14.030
Why does it have to be locked?

32:16.510 --> 32:17.590
I'm a little curious

32:19.510 --> 32:20.270
I just want to see

32:20.480 --> 32:21.720
What's inside

32:23.830 --> 32:24.750
Then I went to see

32:25.720 --> 32:26.240
Server is obvious

32:26.350 --> 32:27.240
Everything is running normally

32:27.400 --> 32:28.350
Not broken at all

32:30.070 --> 32:30.920
I find

32:31.550 --> 32:33.070
Line information has been diverted

32:34.590 --> 32:35.550
one of the information

32:35.640 --> 32:36.590
Transfer object

32:37.510 --> 32:38.750
In Zheyue’s service records

32:38.790 --> 32:39.720
Can't find it at all

32:41.310 --> 32:42.310
I doubt it

32:43.640 --> 32:44.440
someone is stealing

32:44.590 --> 32:45.550
server data

32:47.400 --> 32:48.000
or

32:48.550 --> 32:49.590
Zheyue has always been

32:49.960 --> 32:50.830
They are all working with third parties

32:50.830 --> 32:52.350
Shared server information

32:54.070 --> 32:55.030
video material

32:55.720 --> 32:56.880
I have them all stored on the USB drive

32:57.200 --> 32:57.880
Where is the USB flash drive?

32:59.070 --> 32:59.640
at my house

33:01.070 --> 33:01.480
Set off

33:01.590 --> 33:02.310
Go to their house and get the USB flash drive

33:02.480 --> 33:03.110
well

33:28.030 --> 33:28.480
Tianyang

33:28.830 --> 33:29.400
how's it going

33:31.160 --> 33:31.790
Found someone

33:32.030 --> 33:33.240
On the way back to pick up things

33:33.720 --> 33:34.240
Where are you?

33:35.440 --> 33:36.350
Never came out

34:43.550 --> 34:44.670
Boss, I'm going to stock up.

34:45.190 --> 34:45.670
good

34:49.960 --> 34:51.440
This boss Zhang

34:52.440 --> 34:53.760
How did you discover us?

34:56.150 --> 34:56.880
I doubt her side

34:56.920 --> 34:57.960
There are other eyeliners

34:59.510 --> 35:00.110
Secret whistle

35:00.880 --> 35:01.590
You are not alone

35:01.590 --> 35:02.670
Xiao Yi should be alone

35:03.150 --> 35:03.670
certainly

35:13.880 --> 35:15.320
Liu, where are you?

35:15.960 --> 35:16.550
Shi Qijia

35:16.840 --> 35:17.360
Wu Xigang left

35:17.510 --> 35:18.760
I followed Shiqi upstairs to collect the physical evidence.

35:19.510 --> 35:20.150
send me the address

35:22.030 --> 35:23.400
Go check the community surveillance

35:24.230 --> 35:25.280
Maybe Ye Wu has already taken action

35:25.920 --> 35:26.280
besides

35:26.430 --> 35:26.920
send someone

35:27.110 --> 35:27.800
Go support Wu Xi

35:28.070 --> 35:28.510
receive

36:17.360 --> 36:18.190
Where’s the USB drive?

36:19.030 --> 36:19.550
What's wrong

36:20.320 --> 36:21.320
I obviously put it here

36:23.670 --> 36:24.920
There is a backup in the computer

36:42.030 --> 36:43.230
Why is there nothing?

36:44.360 --> 36:45.440
Do you have any other backups?

36:48.030 --> 36:48.480
have

36:59.760 --> 37:00.110
Shi Qi

37:00.510 --> 37:01.110
What's wrong Shiqi?

37:02.320 --> 37:03.070
go to hospital

37:03.360 --> 37:03.880
what's wrong with you

37:04.280 --> 37:04.670
go to hospital

37:05.000 --> 37:05.280
good

37:05.510 --> 37:06.550
Liu called an ambulance

37:06.630 --> 37:07.280
Send Shiqi to the hospital

37:07.880 --> 37:08.360
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay

37:08.510 --> 37:08.920
You lie down for a while

37:09.230 --> 37:09.710
Shi Qi

37:10.000 --> 37:10.440
Shi Qi

37:21.000 --> 37:21.480
Cuff him

37:22.230 --> 37:22.710
Don't move

37:30.670 --> 37:31.190
Are you OK

37:31.480 --> 37:31.840
fine

37:33.800 --> 37:34.230
Walk

37:53.920 --> 37:55.230
Why did Shiqi faint suddenly?

37:55.710 --> 37:56.630
I followed her all the way

37:57.070 --> 37:57.840
Logically speaking

37:57.840 --> 37:59.230
No one should have a chance to make a move

37:59.960 --> 38:00.630
That unless

38:10.150 --> 38:10.920
Don't touch it for now

38:11.000 --> 38:11.920
anything in the house

38:12.280 --> 38:13.110
Wait for the trace inspection team to come over

38:13.440 --> 38:14.000
more carefully

38:14.030 --> 38:15.000
Check the room

38:15.840 --> 38:16.670
Most likely the same as last time

38:16.760 --> 38:17.670
It's like Shi Lei was poisoned

38:18.000 --> 38:18.800
nerve gas

38:20.070 --> 38:20.550
You are like this

38:21.360 --> 38:21.920
You and Da Liu

38:22.000 --> 38:23.030
Go up first and wait for the trace inspection team

38:23.670 --> 38:24.590
I'll check the target

38:24.920 --> 38:25.440
So clear

38:35.110 --> 38:35.590
Hi-tech

38:39.000 --> 38:39.760
I'll talk to him alone

38:40.960 --> 38:41.360
good

38:54.760 --> 38:55.510
Why is it you?

38:58.000 --> 38:58.880
Who are you?

39:02.070 --> 39:02.960
I am a Jiahui person

39:03.710 --> 39:04.590
You are from Yewu

39:06.880 --> 39:07.360
let me go

39:08.760 --> 39:09.710
What should I do if I let you go?

39:10.760 --> 39:11.800
I know your identity

39:12.230 --> 39:13.360
Find a way to let me go

39:13.400 --> 39:13.840
impossible

39:14.840 --> 39:16.230
Now it’s all people from the National Security Bureau outside.

39:17.710 --> 39:18.880
I'll be finished if I let you go

39:19.360 --> 39:20.510
Aren't you afraid that I will tell you?

39:24.670 --> 39:25.710
I know your identity

39:28.000 --> 39:28.670
You tell me

39:28.710 --> 39:29.920
Do you think you'll be fine?

39:31.510 --> 39:32.510
When the time comes, you and I will benefit

39:32.670 --> 39:33.440
Totally screwed

39:36.110 --> 39:37.110
You are a Jiahui person

39:37.550 --> 39:38.440
You don’t want to hurt her, right?

39:43.070 --> 39:43.960
You heard me clearly

39:45.070 --> 39:46.230
The only thing that can be done now

39:46.710 --> 39:48.070
Just bring the news to her

39:51.280 --> 39:52.480
You came here for Shiqi, right?

39:55.070 --> 39:55.880
Have you found anything?

39:57.840 --> 39:58.630
has been destroyed

40:00.070 --> 40:01.280
Why did Jiahui want to get rid of her?

40:02.710 --> 40:03.480
I have no idea

40:04.960 --> 40:05.710
Who asked her to do this?

40:06.030 --> 40:07.000
why are you asking me this

40:07.510 --> 40:08.150
i have to know

40:08.150 --> 40:09.150
The secret in Shi Qi’s hands

40:09.320 --> 40:10.110
How important is it?

40:10.400 --> 40:11.070
Who will be threatened?

40:11.920 --> 40:12.440
I only know the future

40:12.550 --> 40:13.440
How can I help you?

40:20.630 --> 40:21.550
time is limited

40:26.960 --> 40:27.920
Are you trying to trick me?

40:29.070 --> 40:30.360
I only know what's going on

40:30.630 --> 40:31.590
It won't be like this now

40:31.630 --> 40:32.400
caught off guard

40:33.150 --> 40:34.280
why did you appear suddenly

40:35.280 --> 40:36.590
I am not responsible for this action

40:38.110 --> 40:39.070
I just received a notification

40:40.480 --> 40:40.880
I did not expect

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
It was you who came here to see

40:43.360 --> 40:43.800
If AirPlus

40:43.880 --> 40:44.960
Tell me the situation earlier

40:45.960 --> 40:46.440
Nor will you

40:46.510 --> 40:47.710
Falling into this situation

40:49.440 --> 40:50.920
Why do I think you are lying to me?

40:55.110 --> 40:56.030
What is your identity?

40:58.000 --> 40:59.320
Don’t you know my identity?

41:00.960 --> 41:02.440
I'm a little unsure now

41:17.320 --> 41:17.710
he has admitted

41:17.800 --> 41:18.710
Attacked Shiqi

41:19.000 --> 41:20.150
Take it back for interrogation

41:20.440 --> 41:20.670
good

41:20.840 --> 41:21.190
besides

41:21.400 --> 41:22.230
Let the technical department check it out

41:22.320 --> 41:22.880
his mobile phone

41:23.360 --> 41:23.960
Who have you contacted?

41:24.230 --> 41:24.670
Understand

41:30.760 --> 41:31.630
Wu Xi, are you done?

42:07.760 --> 42:08.630
I have left
