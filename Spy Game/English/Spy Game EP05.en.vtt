[Professional subtitles are being translated. Will be updated soon]

01:43.120 --> 01:44.070
your offline games

01:44.070 --> 01:44.759
What is the content?

01:45.509 --> 01:46.280
Is it that fun?

01:48.120 --> 01:49.280
When you say that, you complain.

01:49.560 --> 01:50.479
If you don’t tell, you’ll ask again.

01:51.150 --> 01:52.310
I'm just worried.

01:52.710 --> 01:54.039
Why do you look like my mother?

01:54.400 --> 01:55.759
Everyone is an adult.

01:56.150 --> 01:57.150
if something really happened to me

01:57.479 --> 01:58.280
I can handle it myself

01:58.590 --> 01:59.509
You said it yourself.

02:07.080 --> 02:08.190
No, you're out this time.

02:08.280 --> 02:09.080
Aren't you happy?

02:09.080 --> 02:09.870
What are you sighing about?

02:13.080 --> 02:13.910
Can't speak

02:14.430 --> 02:16.150
Is there anything else you can't say?

02:19.000 --> 02:19.800
Are you sad?

02:22.590 --> 02:23.280
That's it.

02:25.520 --> 02:26.310
Can you be sad?

02:26.520 --> 02:27.400
It's not a big deal.

02:27.800 --> 02:28.430
I

02:29.079 --> 02:29.800
your brother

02:30.430 --> 02:31.750
Majestic appearance, handsome and elegant

02:31.960 --> 02:33.030
Good-looking and smarter than anyone else

02:33.240 --> 02:34.150
I was abandoned by someone.

02:34.150 --> 02:35.590
This is very embarrassing.

02:39.910 --> 02:40.520
when

02:42.190 --> 02:42.800
Just now

02:43.870 --> 02:44.630
live in thailand

02:54.630 --> 02:55.800
How long have you two been together?

02:57.590 --> 02:58.590
At first I thought it was just beginning.

02:58.840 --> 03:00.240
But it was over before it even started.

03:00.430 --> 03:01.680
This is what is called unsuccessful.

03:03.750 --> 03:04.870
I think I was scammed.

03:06.030 --> 03:06.960
What have you lost?

03:09.870 --> 03:11.190
trust in the world

03:13.910 --> 03:14.800
Brother, are you drunk?

03:15.030 --> 03:15.960
I'm a drinker.

03:19.840 --> 03:21.360
This time you go to Thailand.

03:21.520 --> 03:22.430
Want to play games?

03:22.520 --> 03:23.520
You are still in love.

03:25.840 --> 03:26.910
first time playing game

03:27.590 --> 03:28.750
Then it turned into love.

03:30.310 --> 03:31.400
How did you two meet?

03:33.240 --> 03:33.750
partner

03:34.800 --> 03:35.630
gaming partner

03:40.840 --> 03:41.910
I'm actually a spy.

03:45.190 --> 03:46.430
Don't play with me like this.

03:47.960 --> 03:48.840
if i were a spy

03:49.400 --> 03:50.240
Are you going to arrest me?

03:51.400 --> 03:51.960
affim

03:52.360 --> 03:53.240
I don't know any relatives.

03:56.190 --> 03:57.030
What happened?

03:58.030 --> 03:58.870
I'm kidding you.

03:59.680 --> 04:00.560
I'm just playing games

04:00.630 --> 04:01.800
in game

04:02.840 --> 04:03.400
not really

04:03.590 --> 04:04.590
You made it very clear

04:05.280 --> 04:06.590
Soon you will be traveling across the country again.

04:06.710 --> 04:07.960
Now you're playing spy again.

04:08.120 --> 04:08.960
what happened

04:10.630 --> 04:12.070
Special mission, have you heard of it?

04:13.750 --> 04:14.390
have no idea

04:16.000 --> 04:17.920
This is a special game world.

04:18.480 --> 04:19.870
on the Internet

04:20.829 --> 04:21.510
Yaoyao and I are

04:21.600 --> 04:22.830
Get to know each other in that world

04:23.430 --> 04:24.120
Yaoyao

04:25.950 --> 04:26.680
It's all over.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.360
After saying that, he took away my things.

04:32.560 --> 04:33.390
Then she left

04:34.270 --> 04:35.120
leave without saying goodbye

04:35.270 --> 04:36.190
No reason.

04:41.360 --> 04:42.120
Can't contact you anymore

04:45.680 --> 04:46.310
WeChat phone number

04:46.510 --> 04:47.600
I have no one left.

04:50.430 --> 04:51.720
So I hear you say that.

04:51.720 --> 04:52.720
You two are not close.

04:53.950 --> 04:55.480
If not, give up.

04:56.120 --> 04:56.750
give up

04:57.040 --> 04:58.600
Am I such a submissive person?

05:00.190 --> 05:01.240
food for men and women

05:01.600 --> 05:03.240
Human greed is extremely huge.

05:03.560 --> 05:04.920
Let's talk a little more about this.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.040
In other words, I don’t know people.

05:06.160 --> 05:06.950
Say it louder

05:07.040 --> 05:08.270
It’s a feeling of dedication to me

05:08.510 --> 05:09.630
and betrayal of trust

05:18.510 --> 05:19.630
So, are you still playing games?

05:21.360 --> 05:22.390
I'm in love with you

05:22.950 --> 05:24.720
What games do you usually discuss with me?

05:25.430 --> 05:26.310
Why do you like today?

05:26.430 --> 05:27.240
Let's talk about games like this.

05:27.870 --> 05:29.240
If you continue to play the game

05:29.430 --> 05:30.630
Aren't you two still partners?

05:33.000 --> 05:33.800
that's right.

05:38.190 --> 05:38.920
but

05:39.920 --> 05:40.870
I want to know more.

05:41.270 --> 05:42.430
in the real world

05:43.070 --> 05:44.360
What kind of person is she?

05:45.390 --> 05:47.630
Weren't you very elegant the way you looked before?

05:47.830 --> 05:49.070
What's wrong with you today?

05:50.630 --> 05:51.430
possible

05:51.510 --> 05:52.950
Is it because she is different from others?

05:55.390 --> 05:56.240
maybe in her real life

05:56.360 --> 05:57.390
Not that pretty.

05:58.600 --> 05:59.680
So I wanted to take a look.

06:00.480 --> 06:01.920
how unattractive she is

06:58.000 --> 06:58.680
look.

06:59.750 --> 07:00.360
Completed

07:05.120 --> 07:05.950
CCTV for this account

07:06.120 --> 07:07.390
Notify me when you are online.

07:08.510 --> 07:09.120
Yes

07:12.870 --> 07:13.390
what are you saying?

07:13.870 --> 07:14.430
Miss

07:14.800 --> 07:15.360
Yaoyao

07:17.870 --> 07:19.000
The two never got back together.

07:19.160 --> 07:20.240
really surprised me

07:23.390 --> 07:24.270
Yaoyao left without saying goodbye.

07:24.830 --> 07:25.360
Why?

07:25.720 --> 07:26.430
have no idea

07:29.120 --> 07:29.800
I always thought

07:30.000 --> 07:30.830
Yaoyao is probably Ye Wu.

07:30.830 --> 07:31.630
Arranged for Huang Zicheng

07:31.630 --> 07:32.560
Is it the person next to you?

07:35.000 --> 07:35.720
Have you checked her out?

07:37.560 --> 07:38.480
But there wasn’t much doubt.

07:40.430 --> 07:41.159
this is the best.

07:43.159 --> 07:44.800
But it can be an offline player.

07:45.240 --> 07:46.159
It's not easy.

07:51.870 --> 07:53.190
Huang Zicheng’s current situation

07:53.870 --> 07:54.920
I have no idea.

07:54.920 --> 07:56.190
How dangerous is this game?

08:11.720 --> 08:12.190
personal computer

08:12.920 --> 08:14.120
Huang Zicheng logs into the game.

08:16.270 --> 08:16.950
I'll take you to see

08:17.070 --> 08:18.310
What does he do in the game?

08:20.600 --> 08:21.390
May I come in?

08:45.790 --> 08:47.080
Why am I dressed like this?

08:47.750 --> 08:49.080
Randomly assign accounts to you

08:49.120 --> 08:49.870
There is nothing to choose from.

08:55.510 --> 08:56.630
I'm very happy.

08:57.550 --> 08:58.840
Welcome to Special Mission.

09:21.000 --> 09:21.550
This is where?

09:21.910 --> 09:22.840
divide space

09:23.600 --> 09:24.600
The game will try.

09:24.750 --> 09:25.360
Find players

09:25.550 --> 09:26.630
real geographical location

09:27.000 --> 09:28.030
Regardless, the game is there.

09:28.120 --> 09:29.390
Offline racing section

09:30.360 --> 09:31.150
Games can

09:31.320 --> 09:32.600
Big data shows

09:33.030 --> 09:33.910
Your location is locked.

09:34.150 --> 09:35.000
Just in Jinhai.

09:36.120 --> 09:37.080
Is there such a big country?

09:37.790 --> 09:38.750
this game

09:39.080 --> 09:41.030
aim at the world

09:41.630 --> 09:42.720
So never be specific.

09:42.870 --> 09:43.600
someone

09:43.670 --> 09:45.240
Or somewhere?

09:46.510 --> 09:47.670
If I lived in Zhenhai

09:48.510 --> 09:49.630
Will I receive assignments from Paris?

09:49.630 --> 09:50.360
OK

09:50.870 --> 09:51.390
I just want you.

09:51.550 --> 09:52.630
Points and levels must be accumulated.

09:52.910 --> 09:54.480
You can now open another map.

10:38.750 --> 10:39.600
Player novice

10:39.790 --> 10:41.440
You must use Xiaobai's equipment.

10:41.670 --> 10:43.030
Advanced players can use the skateboard.

10:43.320 --> 10:43.840
If you like

10:44.030 --> 10:44.790
I can lend it to you.

10:45.440 --> 10:45.960
It doesn't matter.

10:46.240 --> 10:46.840
This is better.

10:47.150 --> 10:48.120
I don’t know how to skateboard.

10:49.000 --> 10:49.600
right here

10:49.670 --> 10:51.030
This is the first level of the game.

10:51.320 --> 10:52.000
There is only one pass here.

10:52.000 --> 10:52.630
in order to be able to enter

10:52.670 --> 10:53.670
game provinces

10:54.150 --> 10:55.390
So the mission begins.

10:55.480 --> 10:56.910
This is for new players.

10:56.960 --> 10:57.790
Familiar with all games

10:58.000 --> 10:58.750
Familiar with all games

10:59.150 --> 11:00.440
There will be a prompt on the page.

11:00.720 --> 11:01.720
You just need to follow the prompts.

11:01.790 --> 11:02.510
Come and take control of your body.

11:02.550 --> 11:03.200
This is enough.

11:05.240 --> 11:06.030
Players get ready

11:06.240 --> 11:08.000
The game is about to begin.

11:36.440 --> 11:36.790
Let's do it again.

11:37.120 --> 11:37.630
Let's do it again.

11:49.870 --> 11:50.480
Let's do it again.

12:04.030 --> 12:04.630
over time

12:05.000 --> 12:05.750
mission failed

12:08.630 --> 12:10.030
What's this?

12:11.750 --> 12:13.000
It looks like the world of this game.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.240
It's really not suitable for you.

12:14.670 --> 12:16.630
Now I'm just not familiar with the operation.

12:17.750 --> 12:18.480
I believe this.

12:21.200 --> 12:21.720
Come on, come on, come on.

12:22.030 --> 12:22.600
try again

12:23.030 --> 12:23.670
do it again.

12:24.440 --> 12:25.320
It's not that you can't pass this.

12:25.550 --> 12:26.470
Can't access the main map?

12:26.600 --> 12:27.270
Wait until you pass this level.

12:27.360 --> 12:28.360
Then Huang Zicheng must have been online for a long time.

12:28.630 --> 12:29.550
Let's go, let's go, come on, come on.

12:29.720 --> 12:30.670
You follow me carefully.

12:43.670 --> 12:44.440
Please show me the way.

12:50.320 --> 12:50.870
Good luck.

12:51.360 --> 12:52.750
When you show up, there's a random mission.

12:54.030 --> 12:55.360
The weather is dry.

12:55.600 --> 12:56.670
Beware of fire

12:56.870 --> 12:58.200
The show is about to begin.

12:58.600 --> 13:00.030
white goat herder

13:01.150 --> 13:03.120
The wind blew his hat away.

13:03.720 --> 13:04.630
Puzzle game

13:05.360 --> 13:06.240
How about a pair of skateboards?

13:06.390 --> 13:07.550
I don't want you to do anything.

13:07.720 --> 13:08.480
Use your brain a little bit.

13:08.510 --> 13:09.320
Do something nice for me

13:12.150 --> 13:12.960
Come up and get ready.

13:13.030 --> 13:13.790
Players get ready

13:14.270 --> 13:15.600
The game is about to begin.

13:32.480 --> 13:33.080
yield

13:39.120 --> 13:40.030
Please be careful with it.

13:48.240 --> 13:48.790
Kite

13:49.030 --> 13:49.630
First

13:50.000 --> 13:51.150
1 minute 58 seconds

14:00.550 --> 14:01.360
Astonishing.

14:03.000 --> 14:03.910
affect both

14:04.080 --> 14:05.030
my show

14:11.000 --> 14:12.150
This is the coin in the game.

14:12.360 --> 14:12.960
correct

14:13.790 --> 14:14.480
How to redeem?

14:15.030 --> 14:15.630
application

14:15.720 --> 14:16.790
Linked international credit cards

14:16.870 --> 14:17.510
direct exchange

of course not.

20:43.640 --> 20:44.310
special mission

21:51.070 --> 21:51.790
That's not it.

22:24.510 --> 22:25.350
Why do you ask me?

22:26.240 --> 22:27.310
You are still the one who understands me.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.640
Get out your devil claws.

22:31.440 --> 22:32.480
Can you help me find a player?

22:32.880 --> 22:34.550
Nickname is Anna

22:36.240 --> 22:37.110
Miss

22:42.920 --> 22:44.440
Do I still need to find it?

22:44.920 --> 22:46.030
I was in a hurry when I went there.

22:46.200 --> 22:47.310
There is no contact number.

22:49.070 --> 22:50.000
Do you want to flirt with him?

22:50.350 --> 22:51.000
No

22:51.720 --> 22:52.640
I need to check on her.

22:54.070 --> 22:55.000

23:01.680 --> 23:02.550
I have to get my face back.

23:02.590 --> 23:03.680
Your dignity is something you find yourself.

23:06.750 --> 23:08.270
Aren't you my glory?

23:08.310 --> 23:09.030
Get over it.

23:10.030 --> 23:11.510
I'm still worried that you can't find me.

23:23.240 --> 23:23.720
No

23:24.030 --> 23:24.750
I just want to know.

23:37.270 --> 23:38.200
Find a man and get fifty percent off.

23:38.400 --> 23:39.550

24:18.160 --> 24:19.830

24:20.480 --> 24:21.750
That's the highest level of people.

24:21.920 --> 24:22.790
That level 38

24:24.790 --> 24:26.200
There is no level 38.

24:40.590 --> 24:41.640

24:43.440 --> 24:44.510
Then it's probably him.

24:45.070 --> 24:45.680
Jin Hai didn’t.

24:45.830 --> 24:46.880
There is no better player than this.

24:48.750 --> 24:50.750
But there is little information about her game.

24:51.590 --> 24:52.960
I sent the relevant social accounts

24:53.110 --> 24:53.830
send to you

24:55.160 --> 24:55.880
try it yourself.

24:56.070 --> 24:57.590
It's up to you whether you can find it or not.

24:58.240 --> 24:58.680
OK

24:58.790 --> 24:59.350
You send it to me.

24:59.550 --> 25:00.480
A picture is enough.

25:04.270 --> 25:05.480
You probably won't use this image.

25:05.510 --> 25:06.830
But you have to exchange photos to find people, right?

25:07.640 --> 25:08.640
photographic equipment

25:08.750 --> 25:09.830
filming time

25:09.920 --> 25:11.310
And the economic level of shooting

25:11.480 --> 25:12.350
present in all messages

25:13.510 --> 25:14.350
If your photo

25:14.400 --> 25:15.590
You downloaded it empty handed.

25:18.310 --> 25:20.310
Let me take a look at this phone model

25:20.350 --> 25:21.440
just like hers

25:22.030 --> 25:23.480
Another point is the time of this shooting.

25:23.680 --> 25:24.550
That was last month.

25:26.110 --> 25:27.240
She should have taken the photo, right?

25:29.480 --> 25:30.440
flirt with girls

25:30.590 --> 25:32.510
The effort really went into it.

25:33.030 --> 25:33.750
Yes

25:33.920 --> 25:35.240
Desire is control

25:35.240 --> 25:36.720
The driving force behind technological progress

25:37.030 --> 25:37.790
Already placed.

25:53.590 --> 25:54.440
It should be you.

25:59.640 --> 26:01.030
if i tell you now

26:01.160 --> 26:02.030
Does this count as surrender?

26:04.070 --> 26:05.350
It depends on your attitude.

26:09.590 --> 26:11.310
The B13 example was taken by myself.

26:12.000 --> 26:12.790
Who gave you the order?

26:13.790 --> 26:14.440
professor

26:15.000 --> 26:16.270
Who is the professor?

26:18.030 --> 26:20.160
He said he was Professor Li.

26:21.510 --> 26:23.440
Australian Chinese professor

26:24.110 --> 26:24.960
Have you seen it?

26:25.960 --> 26:26.590
no way

26:27.550 --> 26:29.070
We keep in touch online.

26:29.510 --> 26:30.830
So how did you meet?

26:34.550 --> 26:35.960
I sent the application

26:36.070 --> 26:37.030
Application submitted

26:37.400 --> 26:39.640
The school then responded to my email.

26:39.830 --> 26:41.160
He was the one who contacted me.

26:42.110 --> 26:43.240
He said he saw my message.

26:43.310 --> 26:44.240
admire me very much

26:45.680 --> 26:47.400
But I applied to this school.

26:47.550 --> 26:49.030
Must be a leading international magazine

26:49.270 --> 26:50.310
Published papers

26:51.270 --> 26:52.310
The magazine I am publishing now

26:52.350 --> 26:53.270
no rights

26:54.440 --> 26:55.830
He said he could help me.

26:57.400 --> 26:58.720
But the condition is

26:59.030 --> 26:59.960
in my paper

27:00.030 --> 27:00.880
The latest experimental data must be available.

27:01.030 --> 27:02.510
Experimental data support

27:04.550 --> 27:05.310
He gave me encouragement.

27:05.310 --> 27:06.720
Steal organizational information

27:08.200 --> 27:09.480
I thought then

27:09.680 --> 27:10.750
Can apply

27:11.400 --> 27:12.830
I thought I'd use a little information.

27:12.920 --> 27:13.880
There should be nothing.

27:14.590 --> 27:15.680
I've already done this.

27:17.160 --> 27:18.000
unimaginable

27:19.270 --> 27:20.590
My nightmare begins.

27:21.750 --> 27:23.440
Your paper is very good.

27:24.070 --> 27:24.590
lecturer

27:24.960 --> 27:25.550
So my request

27:25.680 --> 27:26.880
Have you passed?

27:27.440 --> 27:28.200
affim

27:30.110 --> 27:31.110
But there's another thing.

27:31.110 --> 27:32.110
it has to be done by you

27:33.590 --> 27:34.480
about what?

27:35.790 --> 27:36.590
I think

27:36.640 --> 27:37.510
Latest research reports

27:37.640 --> 27:39.350
of your laboratory

27:40.480 --> 27:41.720
Are you kidding me?

27:41.880 --> 27:43.030
It was a document related to secrets.

27:43.720 --> 27:44.590
What are you afraid of?

27:45.720 --> 27:47.240
This is not the first time.

27:52.440 --> 27:53.200
Later I deleted it

27:53.350 --> 27:54.640
his contact channels

27:55.440 --> 27:56.960
But I can't get rid of it.

27:58.110 --> 27:59.680
He started using various methods.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.070
appear in my life

28:01.240 --> 28:01.880
threaten me

28:09.960 --> 28:11.160
That’s enough for today’s live broadcast.

28:11.440 --> 28:12.240
thank you all

28:52.480 --> 28:53.270
You have given up.

28:54.160 --> 28:54.880
I'm worried he will

28:55.030 --> 28:56.790
Publish my paper and steal information

28:56.960 --> 28:57.880
Just like that, I'm done.

28:58.510 --> 28:59.790
So you just go and get it.

29:04.590 --> 29:06.270
I'm the one managing this report.

29:06.510 --> 29:07.440
so easy

29:09.110 --> 29:10.000
How do they know?

29:10.110 --> 29:11.590
You will see the test report.

29:15.400 --> 29:16.110
Because I applied

29:16.240 --> 29:17.640
in personal history of school

29:18.920 --> 29:20.720
It says I work at the institute.

29:21.440 --> 29:22.590
Daily updated report

29:22.960 --> 29:23.790
Have you ever disclosed it?

29:29.440 --> 29:30.200
I've never had this

29:31.440 --> 29:32.160
why do you believe

29:32.240 --> 29:33.440
The Australian professor

29:33.680 --> 29:35.160
At that time I received

29:35.200 --> 29:36.680
From a real Australian school

29:37.160 --> 29:38.070
this is not about

29:38.200 --> 29:38.960
This has nothing to do with you.

29:40.070 --> 29:40.750
He's just using it.

29:40.790 --> 29:41.880
Australian professor status

29:42.200 --> 29:43.200
Let's hide ourselves.

29:47.440 --> 29:48.310
Say something.

29:48.550 --> 29:50.030
Steps you take to steal a sample

29:51.310 --> 29:51.880
sample container

29:52.030 --> 29:52.920
Where did it come from?

29:54.590 --> 29:55.510
that

29:57.240 --> 29:58.720
The professor sent it to me.

29:59.790 --> 30:01.830
He also designed the battle plan.

30:04.830 --> 30:05.720
I will take samples.

30:05.750 --> 30:06.960
Paths issued by the Institute

30:07.070 --> 30:08.110
It was all designed by him.

30:11.680 --> 30:12.440
he understands

30:12.590 --> 30:13.400
Do you understand a lot?

30:14.880 --> 30:15.960
sometimes i feel

30:16.030 --> 30:17.200
he is beside me

30:17.960 --> 30:19.240
He is the person beside you.

30:19.480 --> 30:20.350
But I noticed.

30:20.440 --> 30:21.480
The colleague next to me

30:21.640 --> 30:22.640
nothing found

30:22.880 --> 30:23.640
Where is Chu Lei?

30:29.350 --> 30:30.310
I guess that's not him.

30:31.720 --> 30:33.070
He knew she was going to study abroad.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.070
He also knows you will

30:36.240 --> 30:37.270
It's also in the magazine

30:37.640 --> 30:38.240
Yes

30:39.070 --> 30:40.640
But this is a matter of going abroad.

30:40.880 --> 30:42.240
He always disagreed.

30:43.000 --> 30:43.750
in this matter

30:43.960 --> 30:45.480
We are two different people.

30:47.160 --> 30:48.110
About studying abroad

30:48.240 --> 30:49.240
related business

30:49.720 --> 30:51.440
I almost never tell him.

30:56.440 --> 30:58.030
Moreover, he has always been very kind to me.

31:00.880 --> 31:02.160
I don't believe he would hurt me.

31:03.720 --> 31:04.440
you don't like

31:04.480 --> 31:05.270
I've been a fan of this for a long time.

31:05.720 --> 31:06.160
Really?

31:12.550 --> 31:13.270
I have no idea

31:16.310 --> 31:18.400
People's hearts can change.

31:22.550 --> 31:24.270
But when I was most helpless

31:25.880 --> 31:27.030
They are all around me.

31:27.110 --> 31:27.880
protect me

31:28.310 --> 31:29.160
continue to be my friend

31:33.240 --> 31:34.350
He also asked me to surrender.

31:41.960 --> 31:42.750
australian school

31:42.790 --> 31:43.350
absolutely not.

31:43.350 --> 31:44.240
This Professor Li

31:44.440 --> 31:45.480
All the information he gave Yu Xiaoyue

31:45.510 --> 31:46.070
all fake.

31:47.270 --> 31:48.550
Anyone curious?

31:49.310 --> 31:49.880
sir ray

31:50.240 --> 31:51.400
But the evidence is now insufficient.

31:53.240 --> 31:53.640
But there is one thing.

31:53.680 --> 31:54.510
I still can't figure it out.

31:54.880 --> 31:55.480
Now it seems

31:55.480 --> 31:56.750
He still loves Xiao Yue very much.

31:57.160 --> 31:57.550
when i love you

31:57.550 --> 31:58.640
Why drag her into the water?

31:59.550 --> 32:00.550
love can change

32:00.920 --> 32:02.030
Love can be expressed

32:03.070 --> 32:05.030
This is because we only know

32:05.110 --> 32:06.200
Goals like Shre Lei

32:06.640 --> 32:07.310
So there are a lot of doubts.

32:07.350 --> 32:08.480
will be close to him

32:09.270 --> 32:10.440
Colleagues in Yu Xiaoyue's laboratory

32:10.440 --> 32:11.160
It's all possible.

32:11.270 --> 32:12.830
Although Chu Lei is the most suspicious.

32:13.270 --> 32:14.310
So he must be a professor, right?

32:14.830 --> 32:15.510
or that

32:15.830 --> 32:16.920
There is another person behind him.

32:17.590 --> 32:18.440
I think Liu’s analysis

32:18.590 --> 32:19.350
will be more neutral

32:22.640 --> 32:24.000
Able to monitor Chu Lei

32:25.240 --> 32:25.830
but

32:26.920 --> 32:28.110
You can't keep an eye on him alone.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.440
For those associated with their laboratories

32:31.440 --> 32:32.480
Go to watch list

32:33.680 --> 32:34.030
I have to accept it.

32:34.030 --> 32:35.240
Others around Yu Xiaoyue

32:35.240 --> 32:36.270
check it out.

32:37.550 --> 32:38.790
Also, how is Han Jie doing?

32:40.310 --> 32:41.200
nothing happened

32:41.510 --> 32:42.550
He is moving now.

32:43.030 --> 32:44.160
Stay in the store temporarily

32:45.310 --> 32:46.200
my quote

32:47.200 --> 32:48.350
Let’s wait until he stabilizes first.

32:48.790 --> 32:49.590
Let's take action.

32:50.000 --> 32:50.510
able

32:52.110 --> 32:53.440
Hangyul is just transportation.

32:53.440 --> 32:54.750
He's not really a secret thief.

32:54.830 --> 32:55.480
There is no need to touch him.

32:56.680 --> 32:58.070
But you have to stick to the line.

32:58.350 --> 32:59.160
must fight for us

32:59.160 --> 33:00.480
Give us more time and clues.

33:01.440 --> 33:02.920
Find the people behind the scenes.

33:03.160 --> 33:03.830
excellent staff

33:04.350 --> 33:04.680
I see.

33:04.750 --> 33:05.030
I see.

33:05.110 --> 33:05.440
OK

33:06.350 --> 33:07.440
Are you two together?

33:09.000 --> 33:10.640
I have a seminar next week.

33:10.880 --> 33:12.070
Please help me prepare it.

33:12.270 --> 33:12.960
Meeting information

33:14.160 --> 33:15.000
What seminar?

33:16.070 --> 33:16.680
like this.

33:16.920 --> 33:18.030
I have an old friend.

33:18.270 --> 33:19.640
He is an expert in biology.

33:20.160 --> 33:21.880
First I will go to Beijing.

33:22.270 --> 33:23.960
I asked him to come to our Jinhai first.

33:24.240 --> 33:25.680
Please consult an academic first.

33:26.400 --> 33:27.590
He is an international expert.

33:27.640 --> 33:28.750
Become an international expert

33:29.000 --> 33:30.160
Invitations are not easy.

33:30.400 --> 33:31.160
Yes, I understand.

33:33.590 --> 33:34.550
meeting schedule

33:34.790 --> 33:36.440
I've sent it to your email.

33:37.000 --> 33:37.680
this time

33:37.790 --> 33:39.550
You two are in charge of reception.

33:59.480 --> 34:00.200
The original intention of reading philosophy

34:00.400 --> 34:01.920
Just bring knowledge

34:02.110 --> 34:02.920
to the chinese people

34:03.070 --> 34:04.440
How is the reform carried out?

34:05.400 --> 34:06.360
as

34:06.440 --> 34:07.800
Professional knowledge Q&A website

34:08.190 --> 34:08.880
Read our philosophy

34:09.030 --> 34:10.400
I'm working hard.

34:10.670 --> 34:11.920
Gather quality customers

34:12.320 --> 34:13.760
Produce professional content

34:14.280 --> 34:15.760
To everyone who comes into contact with philosophy

34:15.920 --> 34:17.480
You will get an authoritative answer.

34:22.960 --> 34:23.960
How was your time this time?

34:25.400 --> 34:25.920
This is enough.

34:26.360 --> 34:27.030
Have you met anyone?

34:27.110 --> 34:27.760
Interesting person

34:28.320 --> 34:28.880
have

34:29.360 --> 34:29.920
after that

34:30.070 --> 34:31.110
Let's hang out together.

34:32.110 --> 34:32.760
break up

34:33.110 --> 34:34.030
No intention and no virtue

34:34.630 --> 34:35.760
Live a hundred years

34:35.960 --> 34:37.030
well done

34:37.710 --> 34:38.710
Open a new bar

34:38.710 --> 34:39.400
Would you like to play with me?

34:41.150 --> 34:42.110
I'd rather not go.

34:42.110 --> 34:43.030
I need a break.

34:43.550 --> 34:44.230
So I'm leaving.

34:44.400 --> 34:44.840
you go.

34:44.920 --> 34:45.230
goodbye

34:45.400 --> 34:45.920
goodbye

34:56.550 --> 34:57.550
Why leave without saying goodbye?

34:59.280 --> 35:00.400
Game over.

35:01.590 --> 35:02.070
And then it's over.

35:02.110 --> 35:03.190
Can't we be together?

35:04.030 --> 35:06.070
Games and reality are two different worlds.

35:06.630 --> 35:07.880
Is it necessary to separate them so far?

35:09.030 --> 35:09.840
Don't want to create problems.

35:10.440 --> 35:11.440
I am your problem.

35:12.880 --> 35:13.510
possible

35:14.960 --> 35:16.400
The first stage has a total of five thousand gold coins.

35:16.670 --> 35:17.360
We are two and a half

35:17.630 --> 35:18.110
to find you

35:18.280 --> 35:19.110
I've almost used them all.

35:19.550 --> 35:20.630
You don't have to do this.

35:21.510 --> 35:22.840
but i can't control myself

35:25.070 --> 35:26.430
It sounds like you do have a problem.

35:28.400 --> 35:28.920
What

35:29.760 --> 35:30.840
You said I was a problem, didn't you?

35:31.510 --> 35:32.230
now i tell you

35:32.840 --> 35:33.800
Your problem really comes.

35:34.480 --> 35:35.230
What does it mean?

35:36.320 --> 35:37.070
take you to a place

35:38.280 --> 35:38.880
I dont go.

35:40.190 --> 35:40.840
It's not up to you.

35:57.230 --> 35:58.360
All wet.

36:02.030 --> 36:02.920
very comfortable

36:07.150 --> 36:08.320
This is the first time I know Jin Hai

36:08.400 --> 36:09.960
There are still such clean beaches.

36:10.710 --> 36:11.070
Why are you

36:11.070 --> 36:12.230
It's like I've never seen anything.

36:13.030 --> 36:14.320
grew up in china

36:14.800 --> 36:15.590
Los Angeles

36:16.280 --> 36:17.360
Los Angeles has the ocean.

36:18.590 --> 36:19.360
only

36:19.480 --> 36:20.880
The chances are slim.

36:21.510 --> 36:23.070
Just have fun and play.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.150
So what did you do?

36:26.190 --> 36:26.920
hardworking

36:28.190 --> 36:28.960
No

36:29.550 --> 36:31.000
trying to make money

36:33.070 --> 36:34.150
You may not tell the story of your childhood.

36:34.150 --> 36:35.510
Please listen to me, okay?

36:36.110 --> 36:37.190
Who told you to make money?

36:37.190 --> 36:38.230
Definitely not happy.

36:47.400 --> 36:47.920
you prepare

36:47.920 --> 36:48.760
Have you given it to me already?

36:49.670 --> 36:50.670
everything is a surprise

36:53.070 --> 36:54.320
Let's go eat seafood

36:55.070 --> 36:56.280
seafood?

36:57.590 --> 36:58.000
Please take your time.

37:01.760 --> 37:03.230
It's really nice here.

37:03.670 --> 37:04.550
How did you find it?

37:05.590 --> 37:06.710
this is my friend

37:07.360 --> 37:08.800
You saw my face and ate it.

37:09.360 --> 37:10.110
The store is not allowed to be open to outsiders.

37:10.710 --> 37:11.670
You have a great face.

37:12.150 --> 37:13.110
Definitely already

37:13.150 --> 37:14.550
I grew up in Little South Bay.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.510
Known as the King of the South Bay Area.

37:17.110 --> 37:18.360
Who doesn’t grow hair?

37:18.510 --> 37:19.320
Then

37:20.000 --> 37:21.510
From now on, I still have to rely on you to protect me.

37:23.440 --> 37:24.880
I met you in real life

37:25.280 --> 37:27.030
Not quite like in the game

37:28.920 --> 37:29.670
that game

37:30.190 --> 37:31.190
this is another world

37:31.630 --> 37:32.440
so you think

37:32.630 --> 37:33.760
Is this all a lie in the game?

37:34.840 --> 37:35.440
No

37:36.630 --> 37:38.110
At least the prize is real.

37:40.440 --> 37:41.400
Why did you come to Jinhai?

37:42.070 --> 37:43.480
I don’t want to live in Los Angeles.

37:45.710 --> 37:46.440
has a problem.

37:47.480 --> 37:48.110
Yes

37:49.150 --> 37:50.630
No wonder he left without saying goodbye.

37:50.760 --> 37:52.190
It seems that the previous lessons have been learned.

37:52.840 --> 37:53.920
Come on, what does it look like? let me see.

37:54.590 --> 37:56.280
Why are you gossiping like this?

37:56.840 --> 37:58.400
I just want to see if I'm handsome or not

37:58.480 --> 37:59.280
Are you handsomer than me?

38:01.230 --> 38:01.710
No

38:01.960 --> 38:02.710
of course not.

38:03.190 --> 38:04.230
I'm still young and don't know.

38:05.000 --> 38:05.800
already

38:05.880 --> 38:06.440
I don't have you yet

38:06.440 --> 38:07.630
on a handsome man

38:07.920 --> 38:08.960
wasted many years

38:10.800 --> 38:11.670
Your words have been heard.

38:11.670 --> 38:12.670
Why is it so uncomfortable?

38:15.320 --> 38:15.920
alright.

38:16.550 --> 38:17.230
drink alcoholic beverages

38:26.280 --> 38:27.480
We were friends from college.

38:28.880 --> 38:29.920
We have been together for four years.

38:31.150 --> 38:32.920
On graduation day, he suddenly told me,

38:33.440 --> 38:34.400
His father was very ill.

38:34.670 --> 38:36.030
This requires a lot of money.

38:36.760 --> 38:37.440
this disease

38:37.480 --> 38:38.960
like a bottomless hole

38:39.480 --> 38:40.960
Gonna dig us both out until we're gone.

38:42.670 --> 38:43.280
Another thing about him

38:43.440 --> 38:44.320
No money.

38:44.960 --> 38:46.670
The study abroad loan has not been paid off.

38:48.110 --> 38:49.230
So he said to me

38:49.920 --> 38:50.960
Let me no longer be a burden

38:52.000 --> 38:53.280
You must break up with me.

38:54.230 --> 38:55.360
Who would believe these words?

38:55.480 --> 38:56.190
Who believes it and who is stupid?

38:56.630 --> 38:57.400
I believe this.

38:57.960 --> 38:58.880
I not only believe

38:59.400 --> 39:00.710
I still feel so guilty.

39:01.480 --> 39:02.360
I thought then

39:03.150 --> 39:03.590
cannot

39:04.480 --> 39:05.710
I have to face him.

39:06.030 --> 39:07.110
if you like someone

39:07.320 --> 39:08.070
You should stay with him.

39:08.070 --> 39:09.110
face everything

39:09.190 --> 39:09.630
correct?

39:10.230 --> 39:11.030
So I went home.

39:11.030 --> 39:11.960
Take all your savings

39:12.030 --> 39:12.710
I'll go find him

39:13.480 --> 39:14.280
after that?

39:14.630 --> 39:15.320
You just don't know.

39:15.480 --> 39:16.230
The grandson is in the hotel.

39:16.320 --> 39:17.360
Arrange a wedding with someone else

39:18.000 --> 39:18.800
Talk about the bride

39:18.960 --> 39:19.960
Both rich and powerful

39:20.440 --> 39:21.440
But his face is a bit ugly.

39:21.840 --> 39:22.590
What about his father?

39:23.710 --> 39:25.190
His father was even more unbelievable.

39:26.000 --> 39:26.750
at a party

39:26.880 --> 39:28.110
This is what is called great happiness.

39:28.360 --> 39:29.480
The old man is a martial artist.

39:29.880 --> 39:31.320
A man flipped onto the stage.

39:32.550 --> 39:33.440
Throw a set of punches.

39:34.670 --> 39:36.190
This guy is too funny.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.150
I'm a boxer myself.

39:43.550 --> 39:44.480
But my father's body

39:44.630 --> 39:45.280
very good

39:45.710 --> 39:47.550
looks charming

39:47.550 --> 39:48.400
majesty

39:48.550 --> 39:49.480
Nothing at all.

39:50.670 --> 39:51.960
Actually I understand him very well.

39:53.110 --> 39:53.920
are you alone?

39:54.230 --> 39:55.590
Living abroad is not easy.

39:57.400 --> 39:58.960
Who doesn’t want to work hard for ten less years?

39:59.110 --> 39:59.840
correct?

40:01.920 --> 40:02.710
so

40:03.440 --> 40:04.550
So you are angry.

40:05.070 --> 40:06.150
Return to Gimhae

40:08.360 --> 40:09.150
I received it accidentally

40:09.360 --> 40:10.360
Prajna Acceptance Notice

40:11.000 --> 40:12.030
Want to change the environment

40:12.670 --> 40:13.480
So here I am.

40:15.110 --> 40:17.280
So you're here to treat the wound?

40:19.000 --> 40:20.280
Am I really that weak?

40:21.800 --> 40:22.510
And one more thing

40:23.110 --> 40:24.230
if it weren't for him

40:24.960 --> 40:26.360
Can we two have grilled fish here?

40:27.670 --> 40:28.280
Yeah

40:28.880 --> 40:29.440
you

40:29.630 --> 40:31.230
Normally he seems smart.

40:31.400 --> 40:32.360
Why is timing important?

40:32.400 --> 40:33.110
How stupid is this?

40:33.440 --> 40:34.800
When others hear it, they think it is a lie.

40:34.960 --> 40:35.840
Can you still believe it?

40:36.630 --> 40:38.280
Now that I think about it, it's really ridiculous.

40:39.630 --> 40:40.400
but our people

40:41.360 --> 40:42.320
stuck in feeling

40:42.320 --> 40:43.190
when there

40:43.400 --> 40:44.510
Must be blind

40:45.960 --> 40:46.880
But it's really stupid.

40:53.710 --> 40:54.280
What's your job?

40:54.710 --> 40:55.480
How do you comfort her?

40:55.800 --> 40:56.710
Your hands are covered in oil.

40:56.880 --> 40:57.800
Don't touch my head.

40:58.110 --> 40:59.030
I don't need comfort.

40:59.670 --> 41:01.110
Nothing happened, fine.

41:02.510 --> 41:03.280
Then you shouldn't because

41:03.280 --> 41:04.360
I once met a bad guy.

41:04.360 --> 41:05.190
Let us deny all this.

41:05.550 --> 41:06.230
This isn't fair.

41:11.030 --> 41:12.000
Sometimes I wonder.

41:12.030 --> 41:13.150
Very, very strange indeed.

41:15.030 --> 41:16.670
Some people have been together for that long.

41:17.230 --> 41:18.360
I think I know better.

41:19.630 --> 41:21.000
But in the end you find

41:21.630 --> 41:22.550
What is the other person thinking?

41:23.440 --> 41:24.710
I am oblivious.

41:26.000 --> 41:26.510
i allow you

41:26.550 --> 41:27.710
Can test me over and over again

41:29.070 --> 41:30.150
Are you that confident?

41:31.070 --> 41:31.760
if this makes you

41:31.840 --> 41:32.710
It gives people a sense of security.

41:32.920 --> 41:33.670
I'm OK

41:34.440 --> 41:35.960
from the first time

41:35.960 --> 41:36.880
first time see me

41:37.320 --> 41:38.030
it's my personality

41:39.190 --> 41:40.630
You can easily get hurt this way.

41:40.880 --> 41:41.510
compared to injury

41:42.000 --> 41:43.030
I'm more afraid of missing out.

42:11.550 --> 42:12.320
You have received the assignment.

42:13.030 --> 42:14.000
Such a high bonus

42:15.400 --> 42:16.360
The higher the bonus

42:16.360 --> 42:17.800
This means the risk is higher.

42:18.190 --> 42:19.320
I can only talk about this mission.

42:19.360 --> 42:20.360
more dangerous than before

42:22.840 --> 42:23.320
received

42:23.670 --> 42:24.320
will you come?

42:31.280 --> 42:31.760
affim

42:32.920 --> 42:33.360
I can

42:33.400 --> 42:34.150
How can you go alone?
