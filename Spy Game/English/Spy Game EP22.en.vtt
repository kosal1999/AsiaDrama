01:44.039 --> 01:44.840
why did you wake up

01:48.680 --> 01:49.640
Still drinking secretly

01:55.680 --> 01:56.400
Can't sleep

01:59.430 --> 02:00.280
Do you have any concerns?

02:02.000 --> 02:02.400
not any

02:04.710 --> 02:05.280
let's go

02:17.750 --> 02:18.590
Don't go today

02:19.030 --> 02:19.840
Let's take a day off

02:21.470 --> 02:23.079
Persons eligible for payroll deductions

02:23.680 --> 02:24.310
I send it to you

02:25.310 --> 02:26.079
Breakfast is ready

02:27.910 --> 02:28.470
We'll send it to you

02:28.750 --> 02:29.190
no thanks

02:29.360 --> 02:30.120
I've already called a cab.

02:33.280 --> 02:34.840
drink lots of milk

02:37.870 --> 02:38.360
Good morning

02:39.710 --> 02:40.400
Delayed contact

02:41.560 --> 02:42.400
Convenient transportation

02:43.430 --> 02:43.800
goodbye

02:44.000 --> 02:44.430
goodbye

03:18.150 --> 03:18.750
target appearance

03:18.960 --> 03:20.310
Girl rides a taxi alone.

03:20.870 --> 03:21.520
group catch up

03:22.120 --> 03:23.590
The second group stayed and continued to wait for Xiangyi.

03:24.120 --> 03:24.800
reception

04:38.240 --> 04:39.390
what do you do now?

04:41.720 --> 04:42.480
I think mission accomplished.

04:42.680 --> 04:43.680
No need to rush back

04:44.510 --> 04:45.480
available through her

04:45.480 --> 04:46.720
High-speed rail details

04:49.750 --> 04:50.920
Not yet

04:51.310 --> 04:52.310
Can it be processed cleanly?

04:55.270 --> 04:56.750
Okay, I'll get rid of it.

04:58.000 --> 04:58.600
No

05:00.000 --> 05:01.070
Can maintain relationship

05:03.510 --> 05:05.120
A girl who looks like Xiu Gen

05:06.160 --> 05:06.830
after awhile

05:07.750 --> 05:09.310
I started thinking about getting married

05:10.560 --> 05:11.800
you must take precautions

05:14.680 --> 05:16.600
Why do girls always want to get married?

05:19.630 --> 05:20.630
not all girls

05:22.120 --> 05:22.950
like me

06:30.270 --> 06:31.920
Why is the report false?

06:34.920 --> 06:35.600
I have no idea

06:37.750 --> 06:39.159
I really don't know anything

06:46.040 --> 06:46.560
Yao Yao

07:27.390 --> 07:28.310
I want to go on a business trip.

07:28.600 --> 07:29.000
Yes

07:30.360 --> 07:31.040
Not an executive

07:31.120 --> 07:32.510
Didn't I tell you last time?

07:32.560 --> 07:33.270
It's really in my hands

07:33.270 --> 07:34.680
There's still a lot of work to be done

07:34.750 --> 07:35.680
I really can't walk

07:35.920 --> 07:36.870
put it on top

07:37.830 --> 07:38.390
explain

07:38.390 --> 07:39.560
You should follow me too.

07:40.480 --> 07:41.430
I heard

07:42.000 --> 07:43.510
Mr. Zhou directly asked me to do this.

07:44.390 --> 07:45.240
A bit hard

07:45.390 --> 07:46.070
All flights are booked

07:51.630 --> 07:52.390
when

07:52.630 --> 07:53.159
this afternoon

07:53.240 --> 07:53.950
Get ready quickly

07:54.430 --> 07:55.240
this afternoon

07:56.480 --> 07:57.920
No, I think it's too rushed.

07:58.480 --> 07:59.360
No more days

07:59.430 --> 08:00.600
Just easy clean up

08:04.000 --> 08:04.390
OK

08:39.909 --> 08:40.320
Hey

08:40.960 --> 08:41.720
why so suddenly

08:42.840 --> 08:43.789
boss order

08:44.270 --> 08:45.080
There's nothing I can do

08:49.150 --> 08:49.670
but

08:50.440 --> 08:52.080
Our mission is not yet complete.

08:52.870 --> 08:53.510
I know

08:54.200 --> 08:55.630
This is a normal business trip for the company

08:56.150 --> 08:57.030
Nothing to do with games

08:59.670 --> 09:00.240
That would be good

09:01.240 --> 09:01.870
Let's keep in touch

09:02.360 --> 09:02.870
be safe

09:10.550 --> 09:11.240
Bangkok.

09:35.550 --> 09:36.840
The task has not passed inspection.

09:37.840 --> 09:39.150
How long does a typical review take?

09:39.840 --> 09:42.200
As soon as 1 or 2 hours

09:42.960 --> 09:44.120
If late it will take 1 or 2 days

09:45.360 --> 09:46.750
I'm not worried

09:47.390 --> 09:48.200
But Yaoyao

09:48.440 --> 09:49.320
This is a sudden business trip.

09:49.600 --> 09:50.200
where did you go

09:51.550 --> 09:52.000
Bangkok.

09:52.550 --> 09:53.550
I'm usually on a business trip.

09:57.870 --> 09:58.670
I don't

09:59.240 --> 10:00.150
I'm a little too sensitive

10:01.720 --> 10:02.910
more sensitive than insensitive

10:04.150 --> 10:05.480
She was on a business trip a few days ago

10:05.790 --> 10:07.080
You have to stay in touch with her.

10:09.000 --> 10:09.600
I know

10:11.270 --> 10:12.390
How's your investigation going?

10:15.510 --> 10:17.270
The biggest question was last week.

10:17.720 --> 10:18.960
Third floor leadership network

10:19.030 --> 10:20.000
Have you encountered any problems?

10:21.120 --> 10:22.480
I checked the repair log.

10:23.030 --> 10:23.790
No possibility of unraveling

10:24.270 --> 10:24.840
you think

10:24.840 --> 10:25.910
This network failure

10:25.910 --> 10:26.550
this is artificial

10:30.480 --> 10:31.390
More than you think

10:31.550 --> 10:32.670
How to disconnect from the network

10:34.360 --> 10:35.440
You might even think about nails.

10:38.120 --> 10:39.200
I don’t know if there is a little bit

10:40.120 --> 10:41.030
their network department

10:41.120 --> 10:42.080
if there is a person

10:42.600 --> 10:43.720
So what do you want me to do?

10:44.320 --> 10:45.550
Spies are usually in a department

10:45.720 --> 10:46.870
Set goals for two people

10:48.150 --> 10:49.670
One person supports another person

10:53.270 --> 10:54.000
knew

10:56.270 --> 10:57.120
Then I

10:57.910 --> 10:58.790
along this line

10:59.630 --> 11:00.360
try to investigate

11:01.030 --> 11:01.840
feel their bottoms

11:02.550 --> 11:03.870
Be careful

11:04.550 --> 11:05.750
The nail could be right next to you

11:06.790 --> 11:07.550
knew

11:08.440 --> 11:09.080
stay alert

11:09.440 --> 11:10.270
no one believes

11:24.870 --> 11:25.510
Good evening

11:25.630 --> 11:26.110
welcome

11:26.270 --> 11:27.150
Do you have an ID card?

11:27.200 --> 11:27.550
yes

11:28.150 --> 11:28.600
Thanks.

11:31.000 --> 11:31.750
I think

11:32.440 --> 11:33.600
Mr. Zhou is always interested in you.

11:35.790 --> 11:36.630
What does it mean?

11:39.960 --> 11:40.840
in his eyes

11:40.960 --> 11:42.440
we are a flock of sheep

11:43.550 --> 11:45.030
Play pig eat tiger

11:45.150 --> 11:46.080
Get him off

11:47.750 --> 11:49.150
You said he was yours, right?

11:50.150 --> 11:51.080
he is not interested in me

11:51.510 --> 11:52.670
rather than falling into someone's hands

11:53.390 --> 11:54.440
I better give it to you

11:55.270 --> 11:56.600
I'm not interested in him either

11:57.790 --> 11:58.630
Why

11:59.390 --> 12:00.360
young and talented

12:00.390 --> 12:01.600
Handsome and rich

12:02.750 --> 12:03.750
So I'll leave it to you

12:27.670 --> 12:28.870
Yaoyao arrives in Bangkok.

12:32.510 --> 12:33.840
I haven't seen her for a long time.

12:37.870 --> 12:38.510
It hurts a little

12:39.000 --> 12:39.840
she forgot

12:42.320 --> 12:42.960
I will arrange it

12:48.390 --> 12:49.080
Zhu Yan

12:49.600 --> 12:50.750
Tsugai Japanese Language Institute

12:50.910 --> 12:51.960
PhD in English

12:52.120 --> 12:52.550
after graduation

12:52.600 --> 12:53.720
Direct access to the High Speed ​​Rail Group

12:53.840 --> 12:54.600
Responsible for translation

12:55.240 --> 12:55.670
Qin area

12:56.080 --> 12:56.790
According to the High Speed ​​Rail Group

12:56.870 --> 12:57.790
Provide a list

12:58.000 --> 12:58.320
Zhu Yan

12:58.320 --> 12:59.670
Be a member of the bidding team

13:00.030 --> 13:00.840
The main responsibilities are

13:00.910 --> 13:02.110
Tag translation work

13:02.600 --> 13:03.480
Can touch

13:03.630 --> 13:04.960
The most important secret of bidding

13:05.150 --> 13:06.030
is our standard

13:08.150 --> 13:08.600
first

13:08.630 --> 13:09.360
we must expose

13:09.480 --> 13:10.360
This red letter

13:10.550 --> 13:12.320
Is she a spy?

13:12.670 --> 13:14.030
Portraits attract users

13:14.960 --> 13:15.390
from me

13:15.390 --> 13:16.360
when you see something you know

13:16.750 --> 13:18.150
Zhu Yan has never been abroad.

13:18.240 --> 13:19.440
I have no background in studying abroad.

13:19.960 --> 13:20.630
her social life

13:20.630 --> 13:21.550
it's easy

13:21.960 --> 13:22.840
In addition to the company

13:22.910 --> 13:24.320
The only place she goes the most

13:24.440 --> 13:25.550
There is a yoga studio near my home

13:26.600 --> 13:27.320
I read it again

13:27.390 --> 13:28.390
Xiu Gong’s SNS

13:30.790 --> 13:31.270
look

13:32.750 --> 13:33.550
She hasn't appeared for a long time

13:33.670 --> 13:34.440
love sign

13:34.840 --> 13:35.960
After meeting Xiao Yi

13:36.240 --> 13:37.240
The only one that belongs to her

13:37.320 --> 13:38.030
love journey

13:38.750 --> 13:40.200
They were together recently

13:40.550 --> 13:41.600
SNS from Xiugen

13:41.600 --> 13:42.080
seen it already

13:42.270 --> 13:43.510
She started last month

13:43.790 --> 13:44.840
be able to share their photos

13:46.320 --> 13:46.670
but

13:46.790 --> 13:48.000
SNS of this program

13:48.000 --> 13:48.720
Strange

13:49.240 --> 13:49.870
his account

13:49.910 --> 13:51.440
Newly registered 3 months ago

13:52.150 --> 13:52.790
In addition to sharing

13:52.790 --> 13:54.360
Information about the racing circuit

13:54.550 --> 13:55.150
in other words

13:55.360 --> 13:56.720
His love life with Shu Yan

13:57.200 --> 13:57.720
there is nothing

13:57.790 --> 13:59.080
personal information about him

14:00.320 --> 14:01.270
So this account is

14:01.480 --> 14:02.480
look more

14:02.550 --> 14:03.390
For Shu Yan

14:03.550 --> 14:04.720
I specifically applied

14:06.150 --> 14:07.150
what do you think?

14:07.790 --> 14:08.360
like

14:08.440 --> 14:10.360
This is an elaborate scam.

14:11.670 --> 14:12.150
what do you think?

14:13.120 --> 14:13.550
certainly

14:14.320 --> 14:15.080
Enter the world of spies

14:15.240 --> 14:15.960
no love

14:16.480 --> 14:17.120
love aside

14:18.150 --> 14:18.750
This high-speed rail tender

14:18.840 --> 14:19.670
It's about to start

14:20.080 --> 14:20.630
you

14:21.440 --> 14:22.630
Errors are not allowed

14:24.360 --> 14:25.360
How to suppress red language

14:25.510 --> 14:26.720
The secret method to capture her

14:27.440 --> 14:27.910
being confirmed

14:27.960 --> 14:29.510
Based on the security of national assets

14:30.000 --> 14:31.360
We must do something.

14:31.600 --> 14:32.550
The person behind Shoichi

14:32.670 --> 14:33.270
I'll dig it out

14:33.630 --> 14:33.870
OK

14:34.080 --> 14:34.390
make out

14:49.270 --> 14:50.600
Qin sent me back to the army.

14:52.240 --> 14:53.200
well done

14:53.870 --> 14:54.480
Thank you, Director Gao.

14:54.550 --> 14:55.630
generous compliment

14:56.390 --> 14:57.870
I just haven't said it before

14:58.240 --> 14:59.000
congratulations

14:59.120 --> 14:59.960
you have made progress

15:01.510 --> 15:02.030
Thanks

15:02.360 --> 15:03.270
should be obvious

15:10.550 --> 15:11.510
You said this show sucks

15:11.720 --> 15:12.670
And this Mr. Zhang

15:14.240 --> 15:15.630
I wonder if this has anything to do with it?

15:16.080 --> 15:16.510
certainly

15:17.840 --> 15:19.120
Xiao Yi and President Zhang

15:19.240 --> 15:20.240
The relationship between

15:20.440 --> 15:21.120
before us

15:21.120 --> 15:21.870
Everyone investigated

15:21.870 --> 15:22.750
closer to you

15:23.840 --> 15:24.320
reason

15:24.670 --> 15:25.270
intuition

15:26.030 --> 15:26.750
woman's intuition

15:28.910 --> 15:29.720
Mr. Zhang

15:29.870 --> 15:31.270
like a shadow

15:31.790 --> 15:32.270
and school

15:32.270 --> 15:33.440
He is a true man of action.

15:38.600 --> 15:39.030
Logically speaking

15:46.750 --> 15:47.870
Madam, we're off work.

15:48.080 --> 15:48.600
Sorry, I have to go now

15:48.750 --> 15:49.150
goodbye

15:54.390 --> 15:55.000
Have you done your work?

15:55.550 --> 15:56.080
Any time

15:59.390 --> 16:00.510
Am I always the last one?

16:02.000 --> 16:02.870
I suspect you did it on purpose

16:02.910 --> 16:04.510
They will come after everyone else has left.

16:05.910 --> 16:06.600
I also doubt

16:08.000 --> 16:09.120
You waited on purpose for me to come.

16:09.200 --> 16:09.720
Close again

16:10.670 --> 16:11.080
I agree

16:11.840 --> 16:13.360
I'm worried that I won't have a delicious late-night snack.

16:16.390 --> 16:17.000
What do we bring to you today?

16:17.080 --> 16:17.840
expired food

16:17.840 --> 16:18.510
Could you please keep it?

16:18.790 --> 16:19.720
I have something good today

16:33.550 --> 16:33.960
taste

16:34.960 --> 16:35.390
Thanks.

16:38.270 --> 16:39.790
Late night snacks were originally something I kept for myself.

16:40.840 --> 16:41.720
Now split you in half

16:48.510 --> 16:49.000
delicious

16:51.030 --> 16:52.600
Isn’t that what it’s like to be rich?

16:55.550 --> 16:56.910
Should I charge my card?

16:57.240 --> 16:57.670
I agree

16:59.160 --> 17:00.160
Okay, I'll order a cup of ramen.

17:02.070 --> 17:03.510
I invited a friend

17:04.550 --> 17:05.440
I am now

17:06.440 --> 17:07.349
I'm your friend.

17:13.550 --> 17:14.790
from friends

17:15.790 --> 17:16.550
closer

17:24.000 --> 17:24.829
feel you

17:25.720 --> 17:26.589
I feel uncomfortable

17:30.480 --> 17:30.960
You have

17:34.400 --> 17:35.310
drown your sorrow with alcohol

17:36.720 --> 17:37.240
what happened

17:41.350 --> 17:42.400
I can't say what happened

17:44.030 --> 17:45.510
Recently, it’s closing time

17:46.680 --> 17:47.750
I am very tired

17:50.830 --> 17:51.270
you?

17:51.920 --> 17:52.640
How are you these days.

17:54.070 --> 17:54.960
I haven't been here for several days

17:56.790 --> 17:58.200
Are you busy at work or is your brother busy?

18:00.510 --> 18:01.400
do you remember?

18:04.480 --> 18:05.750
He has been looking for a job recently.

18:06.720 --> 18:07.480
start working

18:13.200 --> 18:14.110
what do you look like?

18:16.880 --> 18:18.480
I feel like the world is changing too fast.

18:19.030 --> 18:20.160
free youth

18:20.720 --> 18:21.720
It's 9:05 a.m.

18:24.350 --> 18:25.480
He has been dissolute for a long time

18:26.430 --> 18:27.830
Another job wants him

18:29.920 --> 18:31.030
I want you to cherish it.

18:37.480 --> 18:38.070
you?

18:39.550 --> 18:40.640
Have you ever thought about it?

18:41.030 --> 18:42.270
Give up your current job

18:43.310 --> 18:44.160
Go find it

18:44.830 --> 18:45.510
Lovely

18:46.400 --> 18:47.310
beautiful girlfriend

18:48.680 --> 18:50.240
You are having fun and giving up your life.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.000
Find a lovely girlfriend

18:54.480 --> 18:55.880
You don't have to give up your job

18:56.920 --> 18:58.110
Get a feel for your current job

18:58.240 --> 18:59.160
It's not fun.

18:59.590 --> 19:00.310
I've been working overtime

19:01.440 --> 19:02.160
certainly

19:03.590 --> 19:04.680
but i never thought about it

19:04.790 --> 19:05.720
You must live without worries

19:06.830 --> 19:08.550
no one is a good girl

19:09.790 --> 19:11.270
You still here

19:12.640 --> 19:14.310
Turn on the broken switch

19:16.110 --> 19:17.720
When I was a kid, I was very self-indulgent.

19:19.830 --> 19:20.680
There's still a chance to turn around

19:21.680 --> 19:22.590
I have passed

19:22.640 --> 19:23.920
I've reached the age where I don't care

19:24.720 --> 19:26.000
it's never too late

19:33.830 --> 19:34.440
let's go

19:36.830 --> 19:37.270
It's too late

19:40.200 --> 19:40.790
work done

19:42.440 --> 19:43.440
Do I want to clean it up?

19:43.640 --> 19:44.030
No

19:44.270 --> 19:45.240
They will clean it up tomorrow

19:48.510 --> 19:49.270
It's too late now

19:49.510 --> 19:50.030
otherwise

19:50.830 --> 19:51.480
i will send you back

19:54.790 --> 19:55.350
Understood

20:08.680 --> 20:09.680
You get off work so late every day.

20:09.750 --> 20:10.640
Let's go home alone

20:12.270 --> 20:12.750
that's right

20:13.830 --> 20:14.750
There are many shops on the road

20:14.880 --> 20:15.510
very safe

20:16.070 --> 20:17.310
but you are a girl

20:18.200 --> 20:19.270
I am already a woman

20:20.310 --> 20:20.790
I agree

20:24.400 --> 20:25.270
How long does it take to get to your home?

20:27.640 --> 20:28.880
Can you drive me home?

20:29.310 --> 20:30.160
Of course go home

20:31.440 --> 20:32.030
we can also

20:32.070 --> 20:33.270
Choose your vehicle

20:34.240 --> 20:34.680
Understood

20:35.880 --> 20:36.880
Take me on your bike

20:38.440 --> 20:38.960
able

20:39.960 --> 20:41.350
Next time I will prepare a tricycle

20:43.590 --> 20:44.200
this is a good idea

21:01.720 --> 21:02.200
Here we are

21:05.880 --> 21:06.310
very close

21:06.790 --> 21:07.110
I agree

21:07.440 --> 21:08.070
Convenient for commuting

21:09.350 --> 21:09.830
sounds good

21:11.350 --> 21:12.200
Why not sit on it?

21:14.920 --> 21:16.240
Shouldn't a gentleman say no?

21:17.030 --> 21:17.750
do not regret

21:20.310 --> 21:20.960
Regret

21:23.200 --> 21:24.070
thank you for sending it to me

21:25.270 --> 21:25.720
goodbye.

22:50.110 --> 22:50.550
Hey

22:52.550 --> 22:53.510
I haven't been home recently

22:54.550 --> 22:55.030
what happened

22:57.510 --> 22:59.310
Gao Tianyang suddenly sent me home.

23:00.160 --> 23:01.070
I don't feel well

23:01.880 --> 23:02.510
I didn't go home

23:05.070 --> 23:06.160
Is he starting to doubt you?

23:07.830 --> 23:08.350
possible

23:09.920 --> 23:10.920
for safety

23:11.640 --> 23:12.400
I went back to my apartment.

23:13.400 --> 23:14.790
I'll find time to clean it up.

23:15.480 --> 23:16.310
take care of yourself

23:38.440 --> 23:39.270
Yes

23:40.480 --> 23:41.480
first

23:42.200 --> 23:43.160
The first philosophy reading template

23:43.310 --> 23:43.880
only one

23:44.030 --> 23:44.750
Campus Q&A Community

23:45.310 --> 23:47.240
many investors

23:47.240 --> 23:49.070
I am very interested

23:49.640 --> 23:51.070
But on the other hand

23:51.350 --> 23:54.550
This website is so professional

23:54.640 --> 23:57.680
The audience is not wide

23:58.680 --> 24:00.160
So they made me lower

24:00.160 --> 24:01.240
User adoption threshold

24:01.400 --> 24:02.590
Adopt more users

24:02.720 --> 24:03.480
I refused

24:04.350 --> 24:07.160
So this is also my first time reading philosophy.

24:07.310 --> 24:09.510
The capital chain is broken

24:09.590 --> 24:12.240
Maybe that's why I can't take it anymore

24:13.510 --> 24:14.070
Yes

24:14.350 --> 24:15.160
You can understand it this way

24:15.350 --> 24:15.880
Yes

24:16.000 --> 24:17.030
why did you refuse

24:17.200 --> 24:18.790
attractive investment

24:19.920 --> 24:22.350
To be honest, I have never had such a luxury.

24:22.350 --> 24:25.350
Let everyone accept philosophy

24:26.240 --> 24:27.030
What do you think of my choice?

24:27.030 --> 24:27.750
correct

24:29.000 --> 24:29.750
I can only say

24:29.920 --> 24:31.440
Your choice and the most

24:31.440 --> 24:33.110
People who work in information technology are different.

24:34.000 --> 24:34.750
different options

24:34.750 --> 24:36.310
It's a different attitude and understanding.

24:36.440 --> 24:37.720
result

24:37.720 --> 24:38.960
I just think

24:39.160 --> 24:42.640
Content and practical abilities are the core

24:42.720 --> 24:46.070
Keys to creating a website

24:46.200 --> 24:49.200
This determines how far you can go

24:49.270 --> 24:50.030
so

24:51.270 --> 24:53.310
we spent a lot of time

24:53.310 --> 24:58.750
Dynamic passion and way of thinking

24:59.000 --> 25:01.960
Yes, no matter how many times I say it, I can’t get started.

25:02.200 --> 25:03.240
try it yourself

25:03.240 --> 25:04.440
you will like it

25:04.510 --> 25:05.920
you will like it

25:06.310 --> 25:07.350
Yes, I promise

25:07.640 --> 25:09.480
I think you are a high quality user.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.200
Bring great users

25:12.310 --> 25:14.880
Yes, it's done

25:15.720 --> 25:16.590
congratulations

25:16.640 --> 25:17.720
Thanks

25:17.830 --> 25:19.270
From the results

25:19.440 --> 25:20.750
your choice is right

25:22.240 --> 25:23.350
This is hope, this is hope

25:23.550 --> 25:26.310
even after one year or twenty years

25:27.200 --> 25:28.790
I came to a conclusion

25:29.350 --> 25:30.790
Thank you for the interview

25:33.550 --> 25:34.240
Thanks

25:35.550 --> 25:36.680
pray often

25:36.750 --> 25:37.400
goodbye

25:39.350 --> 25:40.030
In the live broadcast room just now

25:40.030 --> 25:40.830
Real-time number of viewers

25:40.880 --> 25:42.240
Break platform records

25:42.640 --> 25:43.550
Congratulations Mr. Zhou

25:44.110 --> 25:44.480
This is real

25:44.480 --> 25:45.000
Congratulations Mr. Zhou

25:46.160 --> 25:47.000
This is everyone's contribution

25:47.270 --> 25:47.640
so

25:47.750 --> 25:48.830
Please go back to your room to rest first.

25:49.030 --> 25:50.270
Evening at rooftop restaurant

25:50.480 --> 25:51.240
let us celebrate

25:52.000 --> 25:54.110
Thanks

26:02.720 --> 26:04.070
There is an online shopping mall

26:04.400 --> 26:05.160
let's go out and play

26:07.920 --> 26:08.720
let's go out and play

26:10.440 --> 26:11.240
I will not go

26:11.510 --> 26:12.680
I forgot to invite my friends

26:13.880 --> 26:14.550
what kind of friends

26:15.510 --> 26:16.070
Cool?

26:16.400 --> 26:17.000
take me with you

26:17.160 --> 26:18.030
what's on your mind?

26:18.240 --> 26:19.030
I have a very urgent matter.

26:19.160 --> 26:19.960
You leave, I won’t leave

26:20.960 --> 26:21.830
Don't forget the party tonight

26:23.000 --> 26:23.270
OK

26:23.480 --> 26:23.790
welcome

26:24.550 --> 26:25.070
goodbye

26:25.160 --> 26:25.550
goodbye

26:35.070 --> 26:35.680
Let's eat together

26:39.830 --> 26:40.720
Come on, let's go eat

26:42.880 --> 26:43.270
go

26:43.310 --> 26:44.030
walk to eat

26:45.110 --> 26:45.590
Xiao Huang Xiao Huang

26:45.720 --> 26:46.270
I'm going to have dinner.

26:46.880 --> 26:47.640
You go first, I'll be there right away.

26:47.750 --> 26:48.070
OK

27:15.830 --> 27:16.720
Hello, resource room

27:16.920 --> 27:17.270
Hello

27:17.310 --> 27:18.240
I'm from the technical department

27:18.440 --> 27:19.160
your computer

27:19.240 --> 27:20.680
Has it been repaired before?

27:21.030 --> 27:21.550
It's convenient to go now

27:21.720 --> 27:22.350
Do you want to check again?

27:23.310 --> 27:23.750
Now

27:24.510 --> 27:25.590
Tasks assigned by my department

27:25.830 --> 27:27.070
If the computer breaks down again

27:27.070 --> 27:27.920
will be very troublesome

27:28.270 --> 27:29.680
Now everyone take a break

27:30.830 --> 27:31.880
OK, just a second.

27:32.790 --> 27:33.160
OK

27:53.440 --> 27:54.270
Hello, technical department

27:54.750 --> 27:55.920
Hello, please come here now.

27:56.400 --> 27:56.830
OK

28:30.000 --> 28:31.270
It is said that this was the East Factory of the Ming Dynasty.

28:31.350 --> 28:32.440
invention method

28:33.480 --> 28:34.510
Have a nice name

28:35.720 --> 28:36.590
Rain in plum blossom season

28:39.000 --> 28:39.750
I like this name

28:40.440 --> 28:41.720
Probably not a good experience

28:43.960 --> 28:44.550
do you know

28:45.680 --> 28:46.720
Huang Zichen deceived us

28:48.720 --> 28:49.400
I have no idea

29:00.550 --> 29:02.000
if you tell me the truth now

29:04.440 --> 29:05.070
may be next

29:05.110 --> 29:06.200
not just paper

29:08.000 --> 29:08.720
in a lid

29:09.200 --> 29:10.440
maybe you can fight

29:11.160 --> 29:12.110
Next is the second one

29:12.400 --> 29:13.110
able to breathe

29:13.160 --> 29:14.160
becoming more and more difficult

29:14.920 --> 29:15.590
The third

29:16.350 --> 29:17.920
From the fourth picture to the fifth picture

29:19.510 --> 29:20.880
The paper was dry by then.

29:22.240 --> 29:24.310
Turn each piece of paper over one by one so that the uneven areas are clearly visible.

29:25.200 --> 29:26.110
like a human face

29:34.680 --> 29:35.790
I'll give you one last chance

29:40.750 --> 29:41.750
what on earth did he do

29:43.480 --> 29:44.590
There was something wrong with the documents he was holding.

29:45.550 --> 29:46.680
Don't say you don't know

29:47.960 --> 29:49.160
Dr. Feng’s computer photo

29:49.310 --> 29:49.960
I stole it.

29:50.880 --> 29:52.160
The Macau documents were also stolen from me.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.270
There is also a report on Mr. Huang's computer.

29:54.480 --> 29:55.240
I stole it.

29:56.110 --> 29:56.920
in the middle

29:57.160 --> 29:58.270
what did I do?

29:58.590 --> 29:59.400
you have no idea

30:00.400 --> 30:01.720
If a spy asks you, just say so.

30:03.720 --> 30:04.550
I really do not know

30:06.550 --> 30:07.960
I caught Huang Jiaming's attention.

30:08.880 --> 30:09.680
He went to get the documents

30:10.230 --> 30:11.200
He did get the papers.

30:11.510 --> 30:12.440
he showed me

30:13.110 --> 30:13.680
real

30:15.440 --> 30:15.920
You know

30:17.680 --> 30:19.110
Is it the result of betraying the organization?

30:21.750 --> 30:22.350
I know

30:24.590 --> 30:26.000
if you tell me the truth now

30:28.030 --> 30:29.270
Maybe you don't have to kill me

30:34.830 --> 30:35.750
I really do not know

30:36.680 --> 30:37.750
What I said is real

30:41.640 --> 30:42.400
I really do not know

30:42.680 --> 30:43.640
I really do not know

31:11.310 --> 31:11.750
like

31:12.400 --> 31:13.440
Of course she doesn't know

31:24.270 --> 31:25.310
I really don't want you to know

31:26.510 --> 31:27.400
just very stupid

31:27.440 --> 31:28.270
I believe Huang Zichen

31:48.030 --> 31:48.680
if this is a lie

31:48.720 --> 31:49.830
Huang Zicheng is not alone

31:51.750 --> 31:52.480
behind him

31:52.920 --> 31:54.000
There might be an NSA.

31:56.920 --> 31:57.720
National Security Bureau

32:01.680 --> 32:02.160
work done

32:03.110 --> 32:03.920
work done

32:09.440 --> 32:09.830
I walked through Huangcan

32:10.510 --> 32:10.960
goodbye

32:54.640 --> 32:55.680
the person in front of me

32:55.680 --> 32:56.350
I can't see it

32:57.720 --> 32:58.550
your expression is

32:59.070 --> 32:59.830
Generally speaking

33:00.070 --> 33:00.960
dead for a long time

33:10.070 --> 33:11.590
You were personally chosen by me.

33:13.640 --> 33:15.240
I want to give you another chance

33:21.750 --> 33:22.480
Huang Zicheng

33:25.000 --> 33:25.590
Can be done privately

33:25.750 --> 33:26.790
Can do small movements

33:28.960 --> 33:30.270
I didn't realize I was remiss.

33:33.790 --> 33:34.400
but i can't believe it

33:34.440 --> 33:35.310
He is a national security agent

33:37.640 --> 33:39.590
Huang Zicheng does not necessarily belong to Guoan

33:41.200 --> 33:42.640
But he has an older brother from Guoan.

33:45.720 --> 33:46.480
high sky sun

33:49.200 --> 33:50.200
You face him every morning and night

33:52.550 --> 33:53.480
you should know best

33:53.480 --> 33:54.480
his situation

33:56.480 --> 33:57.070
Huang Zicheng

33:57.680 --> 33:58.750
Is there real fear?

33:59.680 --> 34:00.590
his every move

34:01.830 --> 34:02.880
Are you a spy player?

34:06.960 --> 34:08.230
You believe Huang Zicheng too much

34:10.400 --> 34:11.070
us

34:11.110 --> 34:12.070
true partner

34:12.480 --> 34:13.320
You are different from him

34:16.360 --> 34:17.280
Huang Zicheng is an octopus

34:17.960 --> 34:18.800
You are that thread

34:20.110 --> 34:21.590
This is a bridge between us and him.

34:22.880 --> 34:24.070
you are always in our hands

34:24.710 --> 34:25.320
Huang Zicheng

34:26.070 --> 34:27.070
What's floating in the air

34:30.150 --> 34:30.800
you to him

34:30.840 --> 34:31.760
Feelings are born

34:33.280 --> 34:34.110
But it's dangerous

34:39.320 --> 34:40.590
I dragged him into the water.

34:44.360 --> 34:45.000
That's stupid

34:46.150 --> 34:47.760
You always thought you were cheating on him

34:49.190 --> 34:50.150
he has a problem

34:51.760 --> 34:52.550
But have you ever thought about it?

34:53.110 --> 34:54.150
from start to finish

34:54.280 --> 34:54.960
deceived person

34:55.030 --> 34:55.710
It's you

34:57.190 --> 34:58.320
Sometimes emotions control people

34:58.510 --> 34:59.510
irrational judgment

35:00.510 --> 35:01.630
make stupid moves

35:13.710 --> 35:14.400
My wife is here

35:14.590 --> 35:15.190
Look at the camera

35:15.360 --> 35:15.960
jogging

35:16.320 --> 35:16.630
take it easy

35:17.480 --> 35:18.000
wonderful

35:18.030 --> 35:18.550
Be careful

35:18.800 --> 35:19.150
here we go

35:20.030 --> 35:21.000
received

35:22.670 --> 35:23.000
look

35:24.190 --> 35:25.400
Why did you come to see my sister?

35:26.710 --> 35:27.480
You promised.

35:27.630 --> 35:28.670
Don't go to my family

35:29.590 --> 35:30.320
And this thing

35:30.360 --> 35:31.320
Nothing to do with her

35:31.400 --> 35:32.400
You promised.

35:32.960 --> 35:33.920
One more one, one more one

35:34.110 --> 35:34.710
I told you

35:36.760 --> 35:37.920
we don't disturb them

35:39.710 --> 35:40.320
Just give you one

35:40.320 --> 35:41.280
small warning

35:43.400 --> 35:44.360
your family

35:44.510 --> 35:45.320
I got you involved

35:46.280 --> 35:46.670
do you understand

35:47.840 --> 35:48.400
do you understand

35:51.630 --> 35:52.960
I'll give you one last chance

35:53.760 --> 35:54.840
Go home and see

35:55.670 --> 35:57.230
What is the identity behind Huang Zicheng?

35:58.230 --> 35:58.760
behind him

35:58.920 --> 35:59.440
Who else is there?

36:02.960 --> 36:03.880
Even if Huang Zicheng

36:04.030 --> 36:05.000
I really rely on national security.

36:06.920 --> 36:07.920
But he is for us

36:08.280 --> 36:09.400
Still very useful

36:11.190 --> 36:12.630
This will also affect your destiny

36:14.590 --> 36:15.110
Do you understand it?

36:20.590 --> 36:21.030
make out

36:41.190 --> 36:42.360
I lost contact with Yaoyao.

36:46.150 --> 36:46.920
How long

36:48.710 --> 36:49.230
afternoon

36:49.440 --> 36:50.550
Sent her a few messages

36:50.550 --> 36:51.190
won't come back

36:51.920 --> 36:52.920
I called but didn't answer

36:54.230 --> 36:55.070
The key is the game mission

36:55.110 --> 36:55.880
Not passed yet

36:56.630 --> 36:57.880
I always have a bad feeling.

37:16.000 --> 37:16.800
Task completed

37:18.190 --> 37:19.280
Please call Yaoyao again.

37:28.880 --> 37:29.480
Hey Yaoyao

37:30.030 --> 37:30.550
How are you

37:30.960 --> 37:31.670
It doesn't matter

37:31.920 --> 37:32.400
what happened

37:35.070 --> 37:36.190
I sent you a message, but you didn't reply.

37:36.280 --> 37:37.000
I can't even answer the phone

37:37.230 --> 37:37.960
I'm worried something happened to you.

37:41.190 --> 37:42.280
when i have lunch

37:42.440 --> 37:43.030
I accidentally made soup

37:43.150 --> 37:44.230
Spilled on my phone

37:44.440 --> 37:45.150
my phone is broken

37:46.030 --> 37:46.920
It's done now

37:49.800 --> 37:50.320
complete

37:50.960 --> 37:52.070
I replaced it with a new one.

37:52.630 --> 37:53.150
I just opened

37:53.230 --> 37:54.070
I got your call.

37:54.960 --> 37:55.760
you are safe

37:56.510 --> 37:56.840
That's it

37:56.920 --> 37:57.550
Are you looking?

37:57.800 --> 37:58.510
Task completed

38:05.510 --> 38:06.150
That's very good

38:10.510 --> 38:11.360
When will you come back.

38:13.760 --> 38:14.760
2 days left

38:15.590 --> 38:15.920
that person

38:16.480 --> 38:17.230
when you come back

38:17.280 --> 38:18.110
I will pick you up at the airport.

38:21.440 --> 38:22.150
How did you hear that?

38:22.280 --> 38:23.800
It seems that this feeling is not very strong.

38:26.030 --> 38:27.880
I am very tired today

38:29.150 --> 38:29.630
That would be good

38:29.920 --> 38:31.030
If you are busy, go to bed early.

38:32.070 --> 38:32.550
goodbye

38:34.280 --> 38:34.760
goodbye

38:39.360 --> 38:40.150
something wrong

38:41.760 --> 38:42.800
It seems nothing has changed

38:44.510 --> 38:44.960
she knows

38:45.030 --> 38:45.960
After the task is passed

38:46.280 --> 38:47.280
A little too calm

38:48.760 --> 38:50.000
She might be really tired

38:52.630 --> 38:53.400
Any time

38:54.030 --> 38:55.030
must be cautious

38:58.670 --> 38:59.150
knew

39:13.710 --> 39:14.800
Please exchange it after returning to your country.

39:22.190 --> 39:22.630
go

39:44.510 --> 39:44.880
Yao Yao

39:47.280 --> 39:47.670
Zhouzhuang

39:48.670 --> 39:49.590
Why don't you go out for a drink?

39:51.480 --> 39:52.840
I am a little uncomfortable.

39:53.280 --> 39:53.880
What's wrong?

39:55.230 --> 39:56.190
I feel like I have a cold

39:57.800 --> 39:58.590
Go home early and rest

39:59.230 --> 39:59.800
Please ask the front desk later.

39:59.880 --> 40:00.550
I'll send you some medicine

40:02.190 --> 40:02.840
Thanks

40:25.920 --> 40:26.510
That's stupid

40:27.630 --> 40:29.110
You always thought you were cheating on him

40:30.150 --> 40:32.030
People who were deceived from the beginning to the end

40:32.230 --> 40:32.760
It's you

40:34.280 --> 40:35.480
Sometimes emotions control people

40:35.630 --> 40:36.630
irrational judgment

40:37.670 --> 40:38.510
your family

40:38.760 --> 40:39.440
For you

40:40.480 --> 40:40.920
do you understand

40:42.190 --> 40:42.710
do you understand

41:28.710 --> 41:29.190
OK

41:42.280 --> 41:43.590
Tianyang Investigation

41:43.670 --> 41:44.280
Rooting electronic equipment

41:44.320 --> 41:45.000
No abnormality

41:56.400 --> 41:57.190
two other countries

41:57.360 --> 41:58.230
Project group user

41:58.550 --> 41:59.840
Arrive at Jinhai

42:00.800 --> 42:01.630
This bid

42:02.070 --> 42:02.960
things are important

42:04.320 --> 42:06.360
Keep signage safe

42:08.360 --> 42:09.440
core confidential information

42:11.110 --> 42:12.110
on the last day
