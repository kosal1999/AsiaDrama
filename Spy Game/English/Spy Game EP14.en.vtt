yaw yaw

02:00.480 --> 02:01.000
yaw yaw

02:05.240 --> 02:06.040
You have a fever

02:28.280 --> 02:29.000
lie

02:29.320 --> 02:29.920
I will be right back

03:19.840 --> 03:20.640
have a good rest

06:22.360 --> 06:22.880
I woke up

06:23.600 --> 06:24.080
OK

06:24.760 --> 06:25.360
It's time for breakfast

06:39.280 --> 06:39.640
sit

06:50.159 --> 06:50.880
eat quickly

06:55.600 --> 06:56.120
sorry

06:57.480 --> 06:59.000
Mr. Zhang will not leave us

07:01.160 --> 07:01.840
what should we do

07:02.400 --> 07:03.160
Let's surrender

07:11.120 --> 07:12.000
if you decide

07:12.920 --> 07:13.640
I will go with you

07:16.320 --> 07:17.360
Are you awake yet?

07:18.160 --> 07:18.880
I woke up

07:20.360 --> 07:21.600
whatever your choice

07:22.200 --> 07:23.280
I will face it with you

07:30.280 --> 07:31.440
when i am abroad

07:31.520 --> 07:32.480
I should have been in jail

07:33.320 --> 07:34.680
We are just a few years late

07:35.800 --> 07:36.520
Are you afraid of going to jail?

07:41.560 --> 07:42.480
Who is not afraid

07:45.320 --> 07:46.600
Do you regret it now?

07:47.040 --> 07:48.200
when you come back to me

07:55.800 --> 07:56.280
And you?

07:57.360 --> 07:58.520
Do you regret knowing me?

08:01.560 --> 08:01.960
Zisheng

08:03.040 --> 08:03.520
Yaw Yaw is

08:08.840 --> 08:09.880
Don't apologize to me again

08:10.960 --> 08:11.440
I have

08:11.480 --> 08:12.560
for me

08:13.480 --> 08:14.800
we are done

08:15.120 --> 08:15.960
No one owes anyone

08:18.080 --> 08:19.040
I don't want to go to jail

08:19.960 --> 08:21.040
I don't want you to go to jail

08:21.880 --> 08:23.360
so don't worry

08:24.040 --> 08:24.520
we absolutely are

08:24.560 --> 08:25.600
Looking for ways to save ourselves

08:26.560 --> 08:27.080
but they are

08:27.160 --> 08:28.200
they won't let us leave

08:28.520 --> 08:29.520
This is Tianhai

08:30.040 --> 08:31.320
They won't do what they want to do

08:35.640 --> 08:36.200
Should we?

08:36.240 --> 08:37.280
Continue the mission?

08:40.039 --> 08:40.799
there is nothing

08:40.799 --> 08:41.600
Other tests

08:43.159 --> 08:43.799
Don't worry

08:44.240 --> 08:45.480
It’s not easy to enter a state-owned enterprise

08:46.200 --> 08:47.480
we will wait for the opportunity

08:51.880 --> 08:52.760
let's eat

08:53.160 --> 08:54.360
until I'm satisfied

08:54.640 --> 08:55.840
Except after meals

09:10.440 --> 09:10.840
like this

09:11.160 --> 09:12.600
I'll go to the planning office to check

09:13.200 --> 09:13.880
at the beginning

09:14.000 --> 09:14.760
that hotel

09:15.040 --> 09:16.200
Call for the construction of signal towers

09:17.160 --> 09:19.080
The person in charge of approval is Sun

09:19.520 --> 09:20.080
he admits

09:20.680 --> 09:21.680
He took Zhao Jun's money

09:21.960 --> 09:23.400
and help him secretly

09:23.720 --> 09:24.360
After approval

09:25.640 --> 09:26.600
If you say this Zhao Jun

09:26.600 --> 09:28.000
I knew it wasn't built

09:28.480 --> 09:29.440
He must know

09:30.360 --> 09:31.160
So it came true

09:31.160 --> 09:31.880
Zhaojun Company

09:32.560 --> 09:33.920
He and Chen Tingyunyi

09:34.320 --> 09:35.520
In the past few years

09:35.520 --> 09:36.480
In the past few years

09:37.120 --> 09:37.440
so

09:37.440 --> 09:38.600
relationship between them

09:39.280 --> 09:40.080
no coincidence

09:41.760 --> 09:42.800
Where is Zhao Jun now?

09:43.400 --> 09:44.120
Business trip to nearby cities

09:45.480 --> 09:46.000
we can't wait

09:46.360 --> 09:47.800
Go to the next city to find Zhao Jun

09:48.080 --> 09:49.080
this is very important

09:49.120 --> 09:49.680
penetration

09:50.160 --> 09:50.840
also

09:50.960 --> 09:51.760
Chen Ting's place

09:52.040 --> 09:52.560
Then it

09:52.640 --> 09:53.840
in the human relationship picture

09:54.400 --> 09:55.160
I sent someone to monitor him

09:55.360 --> 09:55.880
Then go quickly

09:56.080 --> 09:56.440
OK

10:09.280 --> 10:09.960
How is the situation now?

10:11.120 --> 10:12.040
Looking for people at the top

10:12.160 --> 10:13.040
To alleviate this problem

10:13.840 --> 10:14.920
it means i can come back

10:15.040 --> 10:15.400
really

10:17.080 --> 10:18.120
before you come back

10:18.480 --> 10:19.400
i will teach you how

10:19.440 --> 10:20.800
How to explain this story

10:21.560 --> 10:22.600
If the national security comes to find you again

10:23.080 --> 10:23.760
you will know

10:23.760 --> 10:24.840
how to deal with them

10:26.800 --> 10:27.360
OK

10:28.240 --> 10:29.080
Where did we meet?

10:30.880 --> 10:31.320
therefore

10:31.680 --> 10:33.080
Wait for my message later

10:34.160 --> 10:34.560
OK

11:15.400 --> 11:16.560
Dai Wei 6 7 8

11:21.480 --> 11:22.400
But they just asked me

11:22.920 --> 11:23.960
Is the car mine?

11:24.960 --> 11:26.360
We need to deliver the gun

11:26.600 --> 11:29.920
No. 9772 Olympic Street

11:29.920 --> 11:30.680
This is the address

11:46.920 --> 11:47.600
how's it going

11:48.880 --> 11:50.240
half time every day

11:50.240 --> 11:51.440
Looking for the right person for you

11:52.680 --> 11:53.600
do you accept it

11:53.720 --> 11:54.600
Behind me?

11:57.640 --> 11:58.560
I won't let you do it in vain

12:01.840 --> 12:02.960
one hundred gold coins

12:04.080 --> 12:05.080
Don't you have money?

12:07.240 --> 12:08.520
I sold all my first gear.

12:09.560 --> 12:10.400
Is it worth some money?

12:12.600 --> 12:14.000
So I'll shoot you now

12:14.280 --> 12:15.800
Can't you resist?

12:17.480 --> 12:18.800
What's your job?

12:20.480 --> 12:22.080
Photography Featured Workers

12:22.640 --> 12:24.160
I can upgrade several levels in a row

12:27.920 --> 12:28.520
then you

12:29.320 --> 12:31.080
Can you tell me?

12:31.240 --> 12:32.360
Before the shoot?

12:34.160 --> 12:35.120
I checked it for you

12:35.640 --> 12:36.880
she deleted her account

12:37.600 --> 12:38.600
I left the game

12:39.680 --> 12:40.520
I found you...

12:40.600 --> 12:42.160
After meeting your partner in the game

12:42.360 --> 12:43.880
a lot of bad things happened

12:45.200 --> 12:45.920
You are the truth again

12:46.520 --> 12:47.560
but not all

12:48.440 --> 12:49.120
man

12:52.360 --> 12:53.440
Can you help me search it?

12:53.800 --> 12:54.920
Clear task log

12:55.080 --> 12:55.680
before game

12:56.240 --> 12:56.920
she lost her account

12:56.960 --> 12:57.920
Where can I find you?

12:58.120 --> 12:59.240
I can help you find this

12:59.400 --> 13:00.000
all is well

13:02.640 --> 13:03.200
this is correct

13:04.480 --> 13:06.120
Register for a virtual world

13:06.200 --> 13:06.960
can delete

13:07.800 --> 13:09.360
Memories in real life cannot be deleted

13:11.840 --> 13:12.600
i won't thank you

13:13.400 --> 13:13.880
Do you want to escape?

13:14.440 --> 13:15.000
where are you going?

13:16.560 --> 13:17.280
No

13:17.760 --> 13:18.840
Do you really want to shoot me?

13:25.520 --> 13:26.480
There is no equipment here

13:26.680 --> 13:27.360
you will be bullied

13:28.080 --> 13:28.560
take it

13:44.960 --> 13:45.880
I have been preparing for a long time

13:46.120 --> 13:47.520
will be open tomorrow

13:47.720 --> 13:49.080
i hope you are encouraged

13:51.400 --> 13:52.240
art forever

14:17.040 --> 14:18.440
Mrs. Chen, are you finished?

14:20.600 --> 14:21.160
I'm back

14:22.440 --> 14:22.960
Have you eaten yet?

14:24.120 --> 14:24.560
No

14:25.400 --> 14:26.040
let's go together

14:28.080 --> 14:28.560
OK

14:31.280 --> 14:32.320
Why are you at home at this time?

14:33.080 --> 14:33.920
I'm going to visit this afternoon

14:34.440 --> 14:35.320
You came back to change clothes

14:55.160 --> 14:56.040
Why are you back too?

14:59.720 --> 15:00.240
Is there anything

15:02.280 --> 15:02.760
there is nothing

15:03.560 --> 15:04.600
I just passed by

15:04.880 --> 15:05.680
I'll go back and get some things

15:11.520 --> 15:12.480
I heard about your art museum

15:13.320 --> 15:14.120
will be open tomorrow

15:17.240 --> 15:18.280
Did Brother Cheng tell you?

15:21.800 --> 15:22.440
I think you are

15:22.560 --> 15:23.400
tell your family

15:25.760 --> 15:26.360
I won't say it anyway

15:26.360 --> 15:27.200
Someone will also tell you

15:29.720 --> 15:30.280
tomorrow

15:31.000 --> 15:31.640
in free time

15:32.440 --> 15:32.960
Me and your mother

15:32.960 --> 15:33.800
and your mother

15:40.600 --> 15:41.120
What do you mean?

15:43.240 --> 15:44.160
when i'm happy

15:44.960 --> 15:45.720
I must cooperate with you

15:45.720 --> 15:46.880
Represents the Family Peace series, right?

15:48.040 --> 15:48.960
Pay attention to your tone

15:50.000 --> 15:50.680
What's wrong with me?

15:51.160 --> 15:51.800
What's wrong

15:55.080 --> 15:56.440
You are wrong

15:58.880 --> 15:59.480
sorry

16:01.720 --> 16:02.920
i know what to say

16:04.080 --> 16:05.280
Welcome, Mayor Fang

16:05.600 --> 16:06.640
Mayor Fang

16:06.920 --> 16:07.480
he comes to visit

16:07.520 --> 16:08.560
Opened his own art museum

16:08.920 --> 16:09.360
perhaps

16:09.920 --> 16:10.440
you bastard

16:19.040 --> 16:19.680
if

16:21.160 --> 16:22.000
Did you quarrel again?

16:22.400 --> 16:23.400
speak calmly

16:25.760 --> 16:26.880
Do you have time on the weekend?

16:28.360 --> 16:28.960
Then let's talk

17:12.000 --> 17:12.359
welcome

17:12.599 --> 17:12.960
welcome

17:13.319 --> 17:13.839
I want to ask

17:13.839 --> 17:14.280
Do you have

17:14.280 --> 17:15.400
Is there a person named Zhao Jun?

17:15.400 --> 17:16.119
His name is Zhao Jun

17:16.319 --> 17:17.119
Zhao Junyou

17:17.240 --> 17:18.359
Let me check it for you

17:18.480 --> 17:19.079
Okay, thank you

17:33.880 --> 17:34.400
Tian Yang

17:35.040 --> 17:35.880
Zhao Jun is in the underground car warehouse

17:38.440 --> 17:39.120
I gotta go

17:40.880 --> 17:41.440
Should I stop him?

17:42.080 --> 17:43.400
No need to follow it first

17:44.160 --> 17:44.560
OK

17:50.080 --> 17:50.760
Why did you change your number?

17:51.800 --> 17:52.320
Safety

17:53.200 --> 17:53.960
What happened?

17:54.840 --> 17:55.320
Let's talk when we meet

17:56.600 --> 17:57.080
Where

17:58.040 --> 17:58.560
Visayas

17:58.800 --> 17:59.600
fully understand

18:39.960 --> 18:40.800
Please go this way, Mayor Fang

18:41.040 --> 18:41.480
OK

18:42.720 --> 18:43.320
thank you today

18:43.400 --> 18:44.440
To take up your valuable time

18:44.560 --> 18:45.840
Go to data center

18:47.040 --> 18:47.880
I've wanted this place for a long time

18:47.920 --> 18:48.400
take a look

18:49.080 --> 18:49.360
from here

18:49.480 --> 18:49.800
OK

18:52.760 --> 18:53.800
Help yourself

18:55.200 --> 18:55.720
Mayor Fang

look left

18:57.400 --> 18:58.760
this class

18:59.120 --> 18:59.880
This is our intellectual reading

19:00.000 --> 19:01.520
in data center

19:02.680 --> 19:03.680
we depend on

19:03.920 --> 19:04.960
Xiaoyu Lake

19:05.160 --> 19:06.200
lower their temperature

19:06.720 --> 19:07.480
Because of the temperature of the lake water

19:07.520 --> 19:08.360
relatively low

19:08.880 --> 19:09.960
After scanning

19:10.160 --> 19:11.520
flow per layer

19:12.000 --> 19:12.840
to lower their body temperature

19:13.600 --> 19:14.640
We have calculated the first step

19:15.080 --> 19:15.840
if you do

19:16.040 --> 19:16.520
can provide

19:16.720 --> 19:18.280
80%

19:18.640 --> 19:19.400
Hope so

19:19.640 --> 19:20.840
Quarterly readings will decrease

19:21.080 --> 19:22.320
and make their own contribution

19:23.400 --> 19:23.840
OK

19:25.520 --> 19:27.240
The essence of technology model

19:27.600 --> 19:28.240
live in city

19:28.360 --> 19:29.640
random communication

19:30.000 --> 19:30.560
this is amazing

19:31.920 --> 19:33.040
The next step is city government

19:33.440 --> 19:34.280
Be ready for next year

19:34.480 --> 19:35.840
next year

19:36.320 --> 19:37.920
in data center

19:38.040 --> 19:39.360
Yes or no? this is amazing

19:39.760 --> 19:40.040
Please start here

19:40.240 --> 19:41.120
I'll take you to the computer room

19:41.280 --> 19:41.680
look

19:45.760 --> 19:46.280
Mayor Fang

19:47.040 --> 19:47.920
Anyway

19:48.120 --> 19:48.960
without your support

19:49.040 --> 19:50.320
we can't

19:50.440 --> 19:51.840
We can't set up a data center

19:54.240 --> 19:55.480
in this era

19:56.480 --> 19:58.200
This is the display of your youth

19:59.320 --> 20:00.080
I'm not young anymore

20:00.920 --> 20:01.920
Mayor Fang, look

20:02.120 --> 20:03.560
It's all under thermostatic control

20:03.760 --> 20:05.160
These are all under the control of numbers

20:05.280 --> 20:06.320
This is a full crystal display

20:06.840 --> 20:07.800
If you want to control the heat

20:08.040 --> 20:09.400
Everything is under your control

20:10.200 --> 20:11.440
Can I touch your hand like this?

20:32.080 --> 20:32.640
mayor

20:33.400 --> 20:33.960
noon time

20:34.000 --> 20:34.840
I've done it for you

20:39.040 --> 20:39.920
I won't go in the afternoon

20:41.720 --> 20:43.320
I prepared a gift in the box at the back

20:44.400 --> 20:45.160
at the right time

20:46.000 --> 20:46.680
bring him

20:47.560 --> 20:48.600
Tell him congratulations on your opening

20:50.800 --> 20:51.280
Did you give her a gift?

20:54.240 --> 20:54.480
OK

21:08.680 --> 21:09.360
I have invited you

21:10.880 --> 21:11.480
Well, come in

21:11.480 --> 21:11.880
Welcome to enter

21:14.280 --> 21:14.680
welcome

21:15.440 --> 21:16.120
I have invited you

21:20.200 --> 21:20.640
Brother Cheng

21:21.760 --> 21:22.600
Congratulations, Lu

21:22.920 --> 21:24.040
you achieved your dream

21:26.120 --> 21:26.800
You come alone

21:30.080 --> 21:31.440
The mayor held an extraordinary meeting

21:31.960 --> 21:32.880
I can't get out

21:36.040 --> 21:36.960
He is very busy

21:39.760 --> 21:40.200
This is for you

21:40.720 --> 21:41.320
opening gift

21:46.800 --> 21:47.680
This is an edit table

21:48.240 --> 21:49.600
Daytona Co. Picasso

21:51.640 --> 21:52.960
I think you will like it

21:55.240 --> 21:56.360
You shouldn't buy this

21:59.080 --> 21:59.440
What?

22:00.840 --> 22:01.960
If I don't buy it, you don't like it

22:04.160 --> 22:05.160
Nothing to do with this

22:05.920 --> 22:07.280
if i buy it i will like it

22:07.920 --> 22:08.560
if he is

22:09.160 --> 22:09.680
All right

22:09.960 --> 22:10.880
take me to see

22:12.040 --> 22:12.720
I tell you

22:13.440 --> 22:14.280
don't blame him

22:14.920 --> 22:16.880
He has a high status and dignity

22:17.560 --> 22:18.120
but he

22:18.320 --> 22:19.280
some things are clear

22:19.400 --> 22:20.800
He doesn't like to express

22:21.600 --> 22:23.520
In fact, he cares about you very much

22:25.520 --> 22:26.000
look

22:26.800 --> 22:27.480
This watch I chose for you

22:27.960 --> 22:28.880
I chose it for you

22:29.320 --> 22:30.200
The nature of father and son

22:30.560 --> 22:31.560
impossible

22:31.720 --> 22:32.880
it cannot be destroyed

22:34.120 --> 22:35.200
I think he is a normal person

22:35.640 --> 22:36.360
Both father and son are righteous

22:37.000 --> 22:37.800
in the end

22:37.920 --> 22:38.480
Gift

22:38.640 --> 22:39.440
She invited others to come

22:41.520 --> 22:42.800
You two are fighting

22:43.160 --> 22:43.880
I don't know when

22:44.040 --> 22:44.920
To make it clear

22:45.160 --> 22:46.080
so can i clarify

22:48.240 --> 22:49.160
sometimes i think

22:49.840 --> 22:50.800
In fact, you are more

22:51.000 --> 22:51.840
More than my family

22:52.840 --> 22:54.160
no matter what happens

22:54.680 --> 22:55.760
You were the one who came before me

22:55.960 --> 22:56.640
help me solve the problem

22:56.960 --> 22:57.440
What about him?

22:58.240 --> 22:59.640
I obey his orders

23:00.040 --> 23:00.560
under any circumstances

23:00.640 --> 23:01.200
preferably

23:01.200 --> 23:01.920
for me

23:02.040 --> 23:02.880
I can't give it back to you

23:03.800 --> 23:05.040
If I fail at work I will be reprimanded

23:05.360 --> 23:05.840
Can you bear it?

23:05.920 --> 23:07.120
It’s right to watch my elder brother being scolded

23:08.880 --> 23:09.720
my brother, tell the truth

23:10.000 --> 23:11.400
He scolded me more than he scolded you.

23:12.800 --> 23:13.440
I tell you

23:13.600 --> 23:14.440
I

23:14.600 --> 23:15.400
like cake

23:15.520 --> 23:16.640
I'm really tired

23:17.200 --> 23:17.640
if you want

23:18.000 --> 23:18.960
You can return the product yourself

23:21.400 --> 23:21.880
Secretary Cheng

23:22.480 --> 23:22.920
Director Chen

23:24.400 --> 23:24.800
they spoke

23:25.520 --> 23:26.240
I want to convey my regards

23:26.240 --> 23:26.720
some friends

23:26.920 --> 23:27.320
OK

23:31.160 --> 23:31.720
how are you my sister

23:32.880 --> 23:33.840
Many people came today

23:34.240 --> 23:34.680
it seems

23:34.920 --> 23:36.080
everyone supports you

23:37.000 --> 23:37.880
Actually when I was in school

23:38.080 --> 23:38.600
I like

23:38.720 --> 23:40.080
art museum

23:40.280 --> 23:40.960
in the museum

23:41.520 --> 23:42.320
I was thinking

23:42.800 --> 23:43.600
if you grow up

23:43.760 --> 23:44.280
i can plan

23:44.360 --> 23:45.200
my gallery

23:45.320 --> 23:45.920
That's great

23:46.680 --> 23:47.560
Who would have thought that they would grow up?

23:48.080 --> 23:49.120
i dream

23:50.760 --> 23:52.520
you didn't expect

23:52.640 --> 23:54.040
To succeed in this matter

23:54.360 --> 23:54.760
Yes

23:55.320 --> 23:57.120
now i think about it

23:58.520 --> 23:59.000
my sisters

24:01.520 --> 24:02.080
Thanks

24:03.000 --> 24:03.840
to realize my dream

24:05.680 --> 24:06.360
I do not think so

24:06.360 --> 24:07.120
Senior Technician

24:08.120 --> 24:08.960
this is your dream

24:09.360 --> 24:10.440
but for me

24:10.720 --> 24:11.680
also

24:11.800 --> 24:13.120
Part of the Yunyi brand

24:14.800 --> 24:15.880
At least you always support me

24:17.160 --> 24:17.760
look at my father

24:18.640 --> 24:19.120
OK

24:20.160 --> 24:20.960
under any circumstances

24:21.160 --> 24:22.040
i must congratulate you

24:22.400 --> 24:23.080
depends on yourself

24:23.160 --> 24:23.760
to fulfill your wishes

24:25.400 --> 24:25.800
OK

24:25.920 --> 24:26.840
we don't want to be here

24:27.000 --> 24:27.840
high art

24:29.720 --> 24:30.520
Leader of the Cultural Department

24:30.720 --> 24:31.320

24:31.800 --> 24:32.520
I leave it to you

24:35.600 --> 24:36.080
OK

24:36.880 --> 24:37.640

24:37.960 --> 24:38.800
Have the ability to go

Serving your artistic dreams

24:40.680 --> 24:41.120

25:16.480 --> 25:17.480
will end soon

25:20.600 --> 25:21.280
OK

26:10.080 --> 26:11.160
He has led to places so far away

26:13.440 --> 26:14.040
Strange

27:07.560 --> 27:08.480
a bit strange

27:17.800 --> 27:18.520
Come and take a look

28:07.960 --> 28:08.480
Are you OK

28:17.560 --> 28:18.200
There was a car accident

Yes, two injuries

28:20.280 --> 28:21.680
Hurry up - okay -

28:31.360 --> 28:31.960
Baishan Road

28:32.960 --> 28:33.480
something happened

28:49.040 --> 28:49.560
Welcome to enter

28:50.360 --> 28:51.440
Meiyuan Museum

Do you like modern paintings?

29:12.960 --> 29:13.520
nature

29:13.800 --> 29:15.120
I am also an artistic man

29:16.560 --> 29:18.040
I don’t know if you are an artistic man

29:18.760 --> 29:20.080
In any case, he is not an ordinary person

29:22.000 --> 29:22.560
Let's go in and have a look

29:23.360 --> 29:23.720

29:24.200 --> 29:25.440
Please show your invitation letter

29:28.240 --> 29:29.040
didn't you

29:29.960 --> 29:31.480
Am I an unreliable person?

29:37.040 --> 29:37.880
Well, come in

29:38.200 --> 29:38.520
Thanks

Is this it?

30:08.920 --> 30:09.320
yaw yaw

30:11.360 --> 30:11.920
Fang Lu

30:14.160 --> 30:14.880
What a coincidence

30:16.160 --> 30:17.240
Fang Lu, I saw him last time

30:19.320 --> 30:20.240

30:20.560 --> 30:20.920
welcome

30:21.680 --> 30:22.040
you

30:22.200 --> 30:23.120
Why did you come to the art exhibition?

30:24.120 --> 30:25.280
i saw

30:25.400 --> 30:26.080

30:26.280 --> 30:27.320
A painter I like very much

30:27.480 --> 30:28.480
The first exhibition was held in China

30:29.320 --> 30:30.520
around here today

30:30.800 --> 30:31.320
I'm here to take a look

30:31.640 --> 30:32.280
I didn't expect it

30:32.720 --> 30:33.760
I'll take you two shopping

30:35.160 --> 30:36.000
Is this your quote?

30:36.320 --> 30:36.640
Yes

30:38.000 --> 30:39.440
Do we make money from this show?

30:41.600 --> 30:42.120
talk about art

30:43.720 --> 30:45.400
Artistic young people only talk about art

30:45.480 --> 30:45.960
don't talk about money

30:46.320 --> 30:46.880
I understand, I understand

30:46.880 --> 30:47.320

30:47.600 --> 30:48.120
Mr. Fang

30:49.720 --> 30:50.440
excuse me

30:54.640 --> 30:55.040
yaw yaw

30:58.600 --> 30:59.040
Near here

30:59.160 --> 30:59.960
There is a Thai restaurant

30:59.960 --> 31:00.560
very good

31:01.480 --> 31:02.760
How about we have dinner together?

31:03.960 --> 31:05.120
No, we'll do it again tonight

31:05.120 --> 31:05.760
What do you think we should try?

31:05.880 --> 31:06.680
your suggestions

31:07.360 --> 31:07.880
have fun

31:08.120 --> 31:09.000
I will come to you soon

31:18.720 --> 31:19.200
sorry bro

31:19.360 --> 31:20.080
Sorry to keep you waiting - it's okay -

31:20.640 --> 31:21.320
i met a friend

31:21.520 --> 31:22.520
Yes, old colleague

31:22.760 --> 31:23.640
You made an appointment to have dinner together

31:24.440 --> 31:25.480
Then let’s go

31:25.640 --> 31:26.080
I gotta go

31:28.080 --> 31:28.480
correct

31:29.800 --> 31:30.440
in fact

31:31.080 --> 31:32.360
Grandpa cares about you very much

31:33.640 --> 31:34.840
you can achieve your dreams

31:35.640 --> 31:36.440
We are all very happy

31:37.880 --> 31:38.320
let's go

31:47.880 --> 31:48.720
Why suddenly?

31:48.760 --> 31:49.600
very excited

31:51.560 --> 31:51.840
No

31:52.440 --> 31:53.720
Who doesn’t eat for free?

31:55.280 --> 31:55.880
you are not that type

31:55.920 --> 31:56.800
He likes to take advantage

31:58.840 --> 31:59.320
say

32:00.280 --> 32:00.920
what's on your mind?

32:02.160 --> 32:03.920
I believe

32:04.600 --> 32:05.840
he is nice to you

32:06.520 --> 32:07.280
What's the relationship between you two?

32:08.160 --> 32:09.280
Didn't I tell you before?

32:10.720 --> 32:11.360
we are

32:11.880 --> 32:13.040
Let's play together

32:13.600 --> 32:14.720
when we go to school

32:14.920 --> 32:16.240
good friend

32:17.840 --> 32:18.800
Why are you nervous?

32:19.160 --> 32:20.000
I'm not nervous

32:22.240 --> 32:22.960
just me

32:23.400 --> 32:24.000
I don't want to mention it

32:24.000 --> 32:25.040
Just talk about the past

32:26.440 --> 32:27.160
past

32:27.200 --> 32:28.320
It has been a long time

32:28.880 --> 32:29.520
there's only us

32:29.520 --> 32:30.320
have dinner together

32:31.320 --> 32:32.680
What's more, he and I

32:32.800 --> 32:33.720
our relationship is very good

32:39.800 --> 32:40.360
you

32:41.080 --> 32:42.160
Did something really happen?

32:45.600 --> 32:46.440
childish

32:47.920 --> 32:49.000
I'm kidding

32:49.560 --> 32:50.280
If you really don't want to go

32:50.680 --> 32:51.600
I will tell him

32:51.760 --> 32:52.320
we won't go

32:54.840 --> 32:55.320
forget it

32:56.000 --> 32:56.600
I agree

33:01.280 --> 33:01.920
if

33:02.240 --> 33:02.840
in 2009

33:02.840 --> 33:03.960
You still have that wooden carousel

33:04.840 --> 33:05.480
years ago

33:05.640 --> 33:06.760
from player

33:07.720 --> 33:08.320
in the previous

33:08.400 --> 33:09.680
I saw someone selling it online

33:09.920 --> 33:11.080
But the price is very high

33:11.200 --> 33:12.320
I simply can't stand it

33:14.120 --> 33:14.760
I tell you

33:15.360 --> 33:16.200
Actually a few years ago

33:16.480 --> 33:17.640
This product has been copied

33:17.800 --> 33:18.600
but little known

33:18.880 --> 33:19.800
if you like

33:19.960 --> 33:20.600
I can help you

33:21.000 --> 33:21.400
no need

33:22.160 --> 33:22.440
Incidentally

33:22.640 --> 33:23.960
I participated in the street series

33:25.200 --> 33:26.400
Rotating Coffee 2007

33:26.600 --> 33:27.160
I just received

33:28.320 --> 33:28.840
those methods

33:28.960 --> 33:30.640
Memories of old times are of great significance

33:31.120 --> 33:31.760
but

33:32.680 --> 33:33.480
honestly

33:33.800 --> 33:35.400
Indoor decorations

33:35.760 --> 33:36.480
needs improvement

33:37.040 --> 33:37.680
totally agree

33:40.680 --> 33:41.400
in fact

33:41.720 --> 33:42.840
I'm at home

33:43.320 --> 33:44.440
at home

33:44.560 --> 33:45.400
This is the town of Lago

33:45.600 --> 33:46.720
We're short of regular coffee

33:47.160 --> 33:48.000
I believe

33:48.480 --> 33:49.360
if you don't collect

33:49.800 --> 33:50.640
i feel pain

33:50.960 --> 33:51.680
this is power

33:52.240 --> 33:53.160
I envy your real name

33:56.440 --> 33:57.960
Both of you are modern art

33:57.960 --> 33:58.840
modern art

33:59.440 --> 34:00.520
not easy

34:00.880 --> 34:01.760
we can't talk

34:01.800 --> 34:02.720
snow in spring

34:03.560 --> 34:04.360
our hobbies

34:04.440 --> 34:05.480
very wide

34:06.320 --> 34:07.520
That's right, both of you

34:07.560 --> 34:08.239
Do you want to drink more?

34:08.480 --> 34:09.159
i want more wine

34:09.320 --> 34:10.000
not easy to find

34:10.000 --> 34:10.920
have the same ambition

34:11.440 --> 34:11.760
perhaps

34:12.040 --> 34:12.360
waiter

34:12.760 --> 34:13.320
two bottles of beer

34:13.400 --> 34:13.960
Come on, drink this

34:14.199 --> 34:14.719
we drink to you

34:21.800 --> 34:22.520
I'm curious

34:22.639 --> 34:22.880
How did you two meet?

34:22.960 --> 34:23.760
How did you two meet?

34:25.840 --> 34:26.480
I am playing game

34:31.800 --> 34:32.520
Are there any games?

34:34.239 --> 34:34.800
special mission

34:39.760 --> 34:40.239
Is this interesting?

34:40.600 --> 34:41.520
There is a pitfall in this game

34:42.159 --> 34:42.600
I noticed

34:43.480 --> 34:44.000
Not good at playing

34:44.040 --> 34:44.960
can easily become dangerous

34:55.560 --> 34:56.120
Hello

34:57.680 --> 34:58.320
Understood

34:58.960 --> 35:00.000
Okay, I'll be right back

35:02.000 --> 35:02.400
What's wrong?

35:02.920 --> 35:04.080
my father forgot the key

35:04.240 --> 35:05.160
I'll go home and open the door for him

35:05.520 --> 35:06.760
OK, I'll go with you

35:06.960 --> 35:07.560
No need, no need

35:07.960 --> 35:08.720
they keep talking

35:09.080 --> 35:09.800
Our house is near here

35:09.840 --> 35:10.560
I will be right back

35:11.080 --> 35:12.040
Eat, eat first

35:29.880 --> 35:30.400
Still there

35:30.400 --> 35:31.280
play this game

35:34.920 --> 35:35.480
sometimes

35:38.000 --> 35:39.480
Something big happened at that time

35:40.440 --> 35:41.120
don't you think

35:41.240 --> 35:42.360
There is something wrong with this game

35:42.880 --> 35:44.280
because there is a problem

35:44.840 --> 35:46.200
so i can move on

35:48.040 --> 35:49.040
After we go in

35:49.600 --> 35:51.160
Brother Cheng received the news

35:51.560 --> 35:52.000
he came here

35:52.360 --> 35:52.960
i am included

35:54.200 --> 35:54.760
then

35:54.920 --> 35:56.080
I was not in good health at the time

35:56.840 --> 35:57.800
as you know

35:57.920 --> 35:58.440
you know

35:59.400 --> 36:00.720
I don't want to get rid of myself

36:01.080 --> 36:02.120
After returning to Tianhai

36:02.280 --> 36:03.080
first thing i did

36:03.120 --> 36:03.800
He restored my phone

36:03.800 --> 36:04.600
I will call you

36:05.480 --> 36:06.520
But I can't reach you at all

36:06.960 --> 36:07.720
I sent you an email

36:07.800 --> 36:08.240
OK

36:08.560 --> 36:09.320
we don't discuss this

36:09.960 --> 36:11.200
it's over

36:17.040 --> 36:18.120
Do you want me to help you?

36:19.080 --> 36:20.000
Have you paid all the money?

36:20.600 --> 36:21.280
I can give it back to you

36:22.320 --> 36:23.560
As long as you don't touch that toy

36:24.840 --> 36:25.520
No need to thank you

36:26.280 --> 36:27.120
i gave everything

36:28.400 --> 36:28.920
Don't worry

36:29.080 --> 36:30.400
I won't play anymore

36:40.760 --> 36:41.480
Can we

36:43.880 --> 36:45.120
Can we become friends

36:53.200 --> 36:54.160
in fact

36:56.000 --> 36:57.640
I was really helpless at that time

36:58.320 --> 37:00.200
Plus a friend left me

37:01.520 --> 37:02.760
i really hate you

37:06.600 --> 37:07.160
But this matter

37:07.160 --> 37:08.160
It has been a long time

37:09.160 --> 37:09.720
don't mention it

37:13.200 --> 37:14.360
after that

37:16.200 --> 37:17.280
i didn't apologize to you

37:17.640 --> 37:19.200
I formally apologize to you

37:20.880 --> 37:21.400
yaw yaw

37:23.080 --> 37:23.640
sorry

37:26.000 --> 37:27.200
Forget about the pain.

37:27.200 --> 37:28.200
it's over

37:35.560 --> 37:36.680
Your boyfriend is very interesting

37:37.320 --> 37:38.160
we get along very well

37:41.240 --> 37:42.720
we are very happy together

37:44.800 --> 37:46.800
No matter what happens

37:47.360 --> 37:48.920
He won't leave me alone

38:08.520 --> 38:09.280
what's on your mind?

38:12.200 --> 38:12.960
I think of Fang Lu

38:18.520 --> 38:19.200
I admit

38:20.080 --> 38:21.800
I specifically promised him a meal

38:28.040 --> 38:28.560
Why

38:28.560 --> 38:29.560
Deliberate mention of games

38:33.360 --> 38:34.000
look

38:35.200 --> 38:36.280
after the accident

38:36.800 --> 38:38.240
Spy organizations threaten you

38:38.600 --> 38:39.120
What about him?

38:40.400 --> 38:41.000
this is the reason

38:41.120 --> 38:42.720
I don't want to contact him

38:43.720 --> 38:44.400
Because I do not know

38:44.600 --> 38:45.760
what happened after

38:45.840 --> 38:46.440
Will you face it?

38:46.520 --> 38:47.640
Have the same situation as me

38:49.760 --> 38:50.320
this is the reason

38:50.400 --> 38:51.640
I want to talk to him about games

38:54.280 --> 38:55.560
you can tell me directly

38:58.440 --> 39:00.000
In the end you still don’t believe me

39:01.200 --> 39:02.200
No

39:03.360 --> 39:03.720
sorry

39:04.040 --> 39:04.760
I just want to know

39:04.920 --> 39:05.560
his identity

39:05.720 --> 39:06.480
I didn't think too much

39:06.520 --> 39:07.280
I didn't think too much

39:12.040 --> 39:12.760
What now?

39:13.320 --> 39:14.120
Do you understand it?

39:14.840 --> 39:15.640
No

39:17.120 --> 39:17.560
All this is because of my father

39:17.560 --> 39:18.600
call me

39:19.880 --> 39:20.600
after she left

39:20.800 --> 39:21.680
What did he tell you?

39:22.480 --> 39:23.160
he said he

39:23.280 --> 39:24.640
He won't play games anymore

39:26.000 --> 39:27.600
I won't play games anymore

39:31.800 --> 39:32.600
Do you think

39:33.880 --> 39:34.840
Is Fang Lu a spy?

39:41.440 --> 39:42.120
I have no idea

39:44.200 --> 39:45.560
but i think

39:46.760 --> 39:48.040
At least

39:48.120 --> 39:49.280
about what happened

39:52.200 --> 39:52.800
I think so

39:53.120 --> 39:54.000
Fang Lu

39:54.080 --> 39:55.320
he seems sincere

39:56.320 --> 39:57.960
It seems not

39:58.000 --> 39:59.160
A person who hides no secrets

40:01.920 --> 40:02.760
how do you know

40:03.400 --> 40:04.120
intuitive

40:05.360 --> 40:06.760
If my intuition helps

40:07.040 --> 40:07.600
the two of us

40:07.760 --> 40:08.760
we won't be like this

40:09.040 --> 40:09.640
this is correct

40:14.520 --> 40:15.320
right now we

40:15.360 --> 40:16.320
we can't protect ourselves

40:17.120 --> 40:17.800
If he partners with Fang Lu

40:17.960 --> 40:18.680
With Fang Lu

40:18.840 --> 40:20.080
will be more dangerous

40:22.880 --> 40:23.560
Whether he has anything to do with it or not

40:23.560 --> 40:24.360
with spies

40:26.040 --> 40:26.560
Don't communicate with him

40:26.600 --> 40:27.240
no longer

40:28.200 --> 40:28.640
OK?

40:53.720 --> 40:55.120
Zhao Jun suspected that someone

40:56.400 --> 40:57.680
He is not a target for arrest

40:59.440 --> 41:00.200
when he follows him

41:00.360 --> 41:01.600
Such an incident occurred

41:02.560 --> 41:03.600
Causes target's death

41:05.320 --> 41:06.440
he blames you

41:07.880 --> 41:08.520
Mr. Chen

41:09.120 --> 41:10.800
that's too far

41:10.960 --> 41:11.800
There are no surveillance cameras on the street

41:12.040 --> 41:13.280
But surveillance video shows

41:13.400 --> 41:13.960
can prove

41:14.400 --> 41:15.120
Mr. Chen, look

41:15.480 --> 41:16.080
Zhao Jun’s car

41:16.240 --> 41:17.440
He was driving smoothly at that time

41:17.680 --> 41:18.480
But after turning

41:18.480 --> 41:18.960
look

41:20.040 --> 41:21.440
The car starts to move left and right

41:22.160 --> 41:22.800
like losing control

41:23.000 --> 41:23.560
when we arrive

41:23.560 --> 41:24.200
another way

41:25.560 --> 41:26.880
But throughout the process

41:26.880 --> 41:27.480
Zhao Jun

41:27.560 --> 41:28.280
alone in car

41:28.360 --> 41:28.960
Have not communicated

41:29.000 --> 41:29.800
with others

41:30.120 --> 41:31.240
and put things in order

41:32.240 --> 41:32.920
need

41:32.920 --> 41:33.840
Complete work report

41:34.360 --> 41:34.920
fully understand

41:35.680 --> 41:36.200
Mr. Chen

41:36.920 --> 41:37.480
this time

41:37.560 --> 41:38.440
it was an accident

41:38.680 --> 41:39.240
I know

41:42.600 --> 41:43.560
I trust you

41:47.680 --> 41:48.960
but we must

41:49.640 --> 41:50.400
we must pass

42:10.720 --> 42:11.120
mayor

42:16.080 --> 42:16.680
You must go and see

42:16.720 --> 42:17.600
Xiaolu Museum

42:18.480 --> 42:19.160
very beautiful

42:25.160 --> 42:26.400
Let's chat when we have time

42:32.680 --> 42:33.280
i saw a girl

42:33.360 --> 42:34.280
i saw a girl

42:35.440 --> 42:36.320
It seems like this

42:37.040 --> 42:38.800
The girl who plays games

42:38.920 --> 42:40.480
In the U.S

42:44.840 --> 42:46.120
Why is she in Tianhai?

42:47.400 --> 42:48.040
I do not know yet

42:49.160 --> 42:50.520
I'll find a chance to ask Teacher Lu

42:52.080 --> 42:52.560
but

42:53.520 --> 42:55.040
I think if

42:56.920 --> 42:57.720
Very enthusiastic
