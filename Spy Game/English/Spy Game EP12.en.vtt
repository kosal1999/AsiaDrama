01:44.580 --> 01:45.030
correct

01:45.500 --> 01:46.580
The cargo ship has been arranged

01:46.910 --> 01:48.500
I'll be on the high seas at noon tomorrow

01:48.750 --> 01:49.910
The area you are familiar with is waiting for you.

01:51.270 --> 01:51.860
By the time

01:52.060 --> 01:53.390
You use this yacht to go out to sea

01:55.750 --> 01:56.300
knew

02:01.580 --> 02:02.390
have you ever thought about it

02:03.070 --> 02:04.350
Life after leaving?

02:05.830 --> 02:06.350
Have thought about it

02:06.950 --> 02:07.580
Go to Australia

02:08.460 --> 02:10.300
Buy a small house by the beach

02:10.509 --> 02:11.070
settle down

02:12.390 --> 02:13.670
I go out to sea every day

02:14.390 --> 02:15.070
fishing

02:15.700 --> 02:16.510
Change your life

02:19.510 --> 02:21.300
Will you find me?

02:24.620 --> 02:25.230
fine

02:29.740 --> 02:30.550
You know me

02:31.110 --> 02:32.270
What do you like about you?

02:33.790 --> 02:34.460
Can cook

02:35.829 --> 02:36.420
what else

02:42.180 --> 02:42.700
I think

02:43.350 --> 02:44.300
There is something about you

02:44.700 --> 02:45.230
let people bathe in

02:45.390 --> 02:46.350
feeling under the sun

02:47.829 --> 02:49.180
Very passionate about life

02:51.070 --> 02:51.670
it may be because

02:51.740 --> 02:52.790
I don’t have it myself, right?

02:54.829 --> 02:55.550
I hope

02:56.510 --> 02:57.460
You have to keep these forever

02:58.700 --> 02:59.579
you can also have

03:00.620 --> 03:01.950
if you are willing to give up

03:03.350 --> 03:03.860
life

03:04.580 --> 03:05.790
It's a trade-off

03:08.070 --> 03:08.700
trade-off

03:09.740 --> 03:10.670
everyone will say

03:11.830 --> 03:13.110
How many can do this?

03:16.070 --> 03:16.740
I can do it

03:22.700 --> 03:24.270
How many people are like you?

03:25.740 --> 03:26.510
But you don’t know either

03:26.700 --> 03:27.670
what you have now

03:28.420 --> 03:29.579
How long can I have it?

03:31.740 --> 03:32.300
yes

03:33.110 --> 03:33.700
so

03:34.550 --> 03:36.350
I try my best to make everything happen

03:36.670 --> 03:37.390
time to have

03:37.579 --> 03:38.300
longer

03:40.900 --> 03:42.350
Even if it costs more

03:45.110 --> 03:46.070
I hope I can afford it

04:29.790 --> 04:30.420
today

04:31.230 --> 04:31.740
could be us

04:31.740 --> 04:32.710
The last time we met

04:35.820 --> 04:36.860
This doesn't sound like anything

04:37.030 --> 04:37.990
Something to celebrate

04:43.909 --> 04:44.860
Separation is also the beginning

05:00.000 --> 05:00.590
Decided

05:01.990 --> 05:02.740
I don't need your boat

05:04.820 --> 05:05.380
Why

05:06.470 --> 05:07.380
fishing club boat

05:07.380 --> 05:08.350
They all stop at this pier

05:09.060 --> 05:09.820
Getting one is for me

05:09.910 --> 05:10.550
It's not that difficult, right?

05:12.180 --> 05:12.820
All are leaving

05:14.180 --> 05:15.060
Don't bother you anymore

05:44.909 --> 05:45.350
separate wine

05:45.470 --> 05:46.380
Now that it has fallen

05:47.620 --> 05:48.030
That is

05:48.030 --> 05:48.990
It's time for me to leave

05:58.710 --> 05:59.300
Stop drinking

06:03.180 --> 06:04.500
Live the life you want

06:08.180 --> 06:08.740
Chen Ting

06:12.060 --> 06:12.860
This bottle of wine belongs to Boss Zhang

06:12.940 --> 06:13.550
Give it to me

06:20.230 --> 06:21.500
She thinks you disappeared

06:22.030 --> 06:22.940
I will be safe

06:39.940 --> 06:40.470
for no more

06:40.500 --> 06:41.470
people who take advantage of value

06:42.350 --> 06:43.260
can be discarded at any time

06:45.590 --> 06:46.710
This is her style

06:50.990 --> 06:52.500
Do you want to continue to work for them?

06:55.620 --> 06:56.550
let's go together

06:57.990 --> 06:58.620
get out of here

07:06.740 --> 07:07.500
sorry

07:09.110 --> 07:09.790
I can't leave

07:16.550 --> 07:17.350
Tomorrow afternoon

07:17.860 --> 07:19.300
The ship will still be waiting for you on the high seas

07:33.380 --> 07:34.740
We'll never see each other again

07:40.990 --> 07:42.500
Live the life you want

07:43.550 --> 07:44.620
It's a lucky thing

07:51.420 --> 07:52.470
What if I have an accident

07:56.500 --> 07:57.230
You will not

07:58.060 --> 07:58.860
I mean just in case

08:02.910 --> 08:04.230
What if I never see you again?

08:08.260 --> 08:09.740
I hope you have what you want

08:11.820 --> 08:12.500
All can be achieved

08:19.740 --> 08:20.470
Have a safe journey

08:31.660 --> 08:32.110
Go quickly

08:37.020 --> 08:37.900
You get off the boat and hide over there

08:47.430 --> 08:48.230
That yacht

08:48.350 --> 08:49.540
There has been no record of going overseas recently

08:50.660 --> 08:51.660
Is anyone living there now?

08:52.260 --> 08:53.230
Didn't pay much attention to this

08:53.780 --> 08:55.620
After all, yachts come in and out more often

09:00.860 --> 09:01.430
Which ship?

09:02.430 --> 09:02.990
This is the one

09:05.070 --> 09:06.710
Why did you leave today without reporting?

09:08.430 --> 09:09.070
Is it this ship?

09:09.110 --> 09:09.470
yes

09:10.540 --> 09:11.780
Immediately notify the Coast Guard for support

09:12.110 --> 09:12.780
intercept that boat

09:12.860 --> 09:13.350
clear

11:15.350 --> 11:15.950
Don't be nervous. Don't be nervous.

11:15.950 --> 11:17.350
I'm just handling the fish

11:17.950 --> 11:18.740
Not finished yet

11:18.830 --> 11:19.540
can you wait for me for a while

11:21.900 --> 11:22.620
Continue

11:28.350 --> 11:29.020
Stop running

11:30.860 --> 11:31.780
I can't even run.

11:32.710 --> 11:33.620
Why are you still going to all the trouble?

11:33.710 --> 11:34.470
Struggle

11:36.310 --> 11:36.990
like this fish

11:37.830 --> 11:39.350
I also struggled after I got hooked.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.020
In the end, I just did it to myself

11:41.260 --> 11:42.110
Just bruised all over

11:43.500 --> 11:44.430
I still need some time

11:44.470 --> 11:45.070
If you don't mind

11:45.190 --> 11:45.830
You can sit and wait

11:46.740 --> 11:47.590
There are baked cookies over there

11:47.830 --> 11:48.500
random

11:59.350 --> 12:00.710
You've been hiding on this yacht

12:03.110 --> 12:03.990
Not hiding

12:04.380 --> 12:05.070
is to live

12:06.020 --> 12:07.310
I love living on a yacht

12:07.780 --> 12:08.830
Available all year round

12:10.060 --> 12:11.710
every morning and evening

12:11.900 --> 12:13.310
It’s the best time for sea fishing

12:14.830 --> 12:15.710
Especially this sea area

12:15.740 --> 12:16.830
It's fishing season now

12:17.950 --> 12:18.540
marvelous

12:24.540 --> 12:25.310
is good

12:26.620 --> 12:27.950
But you fish for yourself

12:28.350 --> 12:29.430
It must be too lonely

12:32.780 --> 12:33.950
Who is the person who will help you?

12:36.350 --> 12:37.900
Is there anyone who can help me?

12:41.350 --> 12:42.710
I am an outcast

12:44.500 --> 12:46.310
That is, relying on previous relationships

12:47.020 --> 12:48.070
Borrowed this yacht

12:49.590 --> 12:50.830
Now you're causing trouble

12:51.830 --> 12:52.990
I still feel a little sorry.

12:54.020 --> 12:55.830
Are you working with Yunyi Group now?

12:55.990 --> 12:57.020
Clear the relationship?

12:59.590 --> 13:00.950
they are just my clients

13:03.230 --> 13:04.780
I can tell you my upline

13:05.780 --> 13:06.470
Who?

13:08.860 --> 13:09.430
Boss Zhang

13:10.540 --> 13:11.710
Who is Boss Zhang?

13:14.310 --> 13:15.260
Don't you want to try it?

13:17.380 --> 13:17.830
if you are willing to

13:18.020 --> 13:19.260
Say a few more words

13:20.070 --> 13:21.500
I'm still in the mood to taste it

13:25.190 --> 13:26.020
missed this time

13:27.230 --> 13:29.020
I won't have the chance to do it again in the future

13:33.430 --> 13:34.070
Han Jie

13:36.350 --> 13:36.830
me to you

13:36.860 --> 13:37.900
I still know a lot about it

13:40.310 --> 13:41.780
You are a person who loves life

13:43.260 --> 13:44.590
why do you want to be a spy

13:53.110 --> 13:53.990
adventurous

13:58.660 --> 14:00.500
like challenges

14:03.190 --> 14:03.950
like

14:04.780 --> 14:05.500
exciting things

14:06.590 --> 14:07.950
Are you satisfied with this answer?

14:09.110 --> 14:10.020
have you ever thought about

14:10.780 --> 14:12.110
The stimulation you want

14:12.660 --> 14:14.310
has harmed the interests of the country

14:15.540 --> 14:16.310
I know

14:18.500 --> 14:20.310
Don’t you deserve it now?

14:24.310 --> 14:25.540
Don’t you really want to try it?

14:26.070 --> 14:27.310
Taste quite good

14:28.470 --> 14:29.900
Pufferfish is a dangerous food

14:33.350 --> 14:35.070
In the final analysis, I just don’t dare to taste it.

14:36.110 --> 14:36.740
That's right

14:38.260 --> 14:39.780
Everyone knows that pufferfish is poisonous

14:41.860 --> 14:42.950
But there are still so many people

14:43.110 --> 14:44.110
like to eat it

14:46.540 --> 14:48.260
The so-called poisonous and fresh

14:48.590 --> 14:49.780
I'm afraid that's it

14:51.710 --> 14:52.830
like us

14:55.020 --> 14:56.590
I knew something was wrong

14:56.660 --> 14:57.590
What will happen?

14:57.740 --> 14:58.380
but

15:00.230 --> 15:01.430
Still can't escape

15:03.070 --> 15:04.070
To put it bluntly, that’s

15:04.310 --> 15:05.590
your benefits

15:05.590 --> 15:07.260
Enough to make you willing to take risks

15:09.500 --> 15:10.860
What a pity for such a good fish

15:12.780 --> 15:14.310
Those poisonous ones are all there.

15:14.740 --> 15:15.380
I know

15:16.540 --> 15:17.990
Now is not the time to taste

15:22.470 --> 15:24.260
You and I can be regarded as equals in chess

15:28.190 --> 15:29.190
Let's have a drink

15:30.430 --> 15:32.310
maybe i can tell you more

15:38.470 --> 15:39.230
Han Jie

15:40.860 --> 15:41.540
i have given it to you

15:41.620 --> 15:42.590
enough time

15:45.310 --> 15:46.190
Who is Boss Zhang?

15:50.000 --> 15:51.500
I don’t know who Boss Zhang is either.

15:56.780 --> 15:57.540
but

15:59.590 --> 16:01.110
This bottle of wine was given to me by her

16:06.470 --> 16:07.310
Han Jie

16:18.830 --> 16:19.380
boss

16:20.710 --> 16:21.740
There is a police officer outside looking for you

16:25.020 --> 16:25.620
knew

16:35.830 --> 16:36.660
Han Jie has been hiding

16:36.710 --> 16:37.470
on your yacht

16:38.230 --> 16:38.830
do you know

16:40.310 --> 16:40.900
I know

16:41.470 --> 16:42.310
Not only I know

16:42.830 --> 16:43.540
my secretary

16:43.620 --> 16:45.190
Even the account manager knows it too

16:45.950 --> 16:47.310
He often borrowed our boat

16:47.500 --> 16:48.190
Go fishing

16:48.830 --> 16:49.860
He is our supplier

16:50.230 --> 16:51.620
So we have kept

16:51.740 --> 16:53.070
Good working relations

17:01.470 --> 17:03.990
What's wrong with him?

17:32.470 --> 17:33.300
What happened to Han Jie?

17:34.430 --> 17:36.100
His body was seen

17:36.300 --> 17:37.780
Transported away by national security

17:41.060 --> 17:43.020
You shouldn't be sad now

17:44.710 --> 17:45.870
should be thankful

17:48.430 --> 17:49.580
Glad he didn't fall

17:49.820 --> 17:50.820
In the hands of Guoan

17:57.580 --> 17:59.500
I can't be as cold-blooded as you

18:01.390 --> 18:03.630
Only by being cold-blooded can you protect yourself

18:05.580 --> 18:07.300
Don't forget your identity

18:12.540 --> 18:13.870
I hope you will

18:15.000 --> 18:16.630
Don't make this mistake again

18:18.430 --> 18:19.100
otherwise

18:20.260 --> 18:22.470
Everything you have worked so hard for

18:23.630 --> 18:24.230
you

18:25.260 --> 18:26.670
and the person behind you

18:28.060 --> 18:29.580
They will all be like Han Jie

18:30.780 --> 18:32.190
Same fate

19:40.740 --> 19:41.260
Hello

19:42.780 --> 19:43.710
Sister, I'm here

19:44.020 --> 19:44.820
when are you coming over

19:47.230 --> 19:48.100
I am coming over now

20:22.470 --> 20:23.100
goodbye

21:00.990 --> 21:01.500
How about it

21:01.990 --> 21:02.670
Is this location okay?

21:03.260 --> 21:03.820
I was

21:03.870 --> 21:04.580
I fell in love with it at first glance

21:04.820 --> 21:05.910
The rent was paid on the same day

21:07.190 --> 21:08.100
Find peace amidst the noise

21:08.740 --> 21:10.630
This exhibition hall was really well chosen.

21:12.060 --> 21:13.100
Especially this trademark

21:13.670 --> 21:14.430
Very chic

21:14.630 --> 21:15.300
I'll take a photo

21:18.780 --> 21:19.470
Then let's go in and take a look

21:19.670 --> 21:20.260
Good to go

21:24.820 --> 21:25.340
Fang Lu

21:26.190 --> 21:26.630
Sister Ting

21:26.950 --> 21:27.630
Secretary Zheng

21:28.060 --> 21:28.990
It's rare to have free time

21:30.300 --> 21:31.780
Xiao Lu’s business is my business

21:32.540 --> 21:33.740
Then let's go in and take a look together

21:34.060 --> 21:34.340
good

21:34.390 --> 21:34.580
Walk

21:34.710 --> 21:35.000
please

21:37.990 --> 21:38.390
Come

21:38.540 --> 21:39.230
This way

21:40.060 --> 21:41.990
Look at the shape of this gate

21:42.540 --> 21:43.190
This material

21:43.430 --> 21:44.300
Matte Black

21:46.630 --> 21:48.020
Help me check the Cloud Art Museum

21:51.870 --> 21:52.710
These just arrived

21:52.910 --> 21:53.780
I haven’t had time to show it yet.

21:54.910 --> 21:55.540
The exhibition hall is above

21:55.580 --> 21:56.390
Let's go up and have a look

21:56.630 --> 21:57.260
Walk

21:59.820 --> 22:00.740
All the decorations here

22:00.950 --> 22:01.780
It’s all Fang Lu alone

22:01.870 --> 22:02.670
Completed by supervisor

22:04.190 --> 22:05.190
Mayor Fang saw it

22:05.580 --> 22:06.990
It will definitely be gratifying

22:08.630 --> 22:09.780
This matter has nothing to do with him

22:10.300 --> 22:11.260
He wouldn't care either

22:17.340 --> 22:18.020
Slower

22:18.780 --> 22:19.390
Are you okay?

22:20.260 --> 22:21.020
This is in Exhibition Hall 3

22:21.060 --> 22:21.670
Turn right ahead

22:21.990 --> 22:22.470
Slower

22:39.910 --> 22:40.430
National Security Bureau

22:40.910 --> 22:42.060
Looking for resort hotels

22:42.060 --> 22:42.820
Signal tower

22:44.670 --> 22:46.230
Why is the national security involved?

22:47.470 --> 22:48.340
There's some trouble

22:49.100 --> 22:49.540
I see

22:49.820 --> 22:50.470
I'll take care of it

22:51.020 --> 22:51.740
I'm tired

22:52.820 --> 22:54.100
Is there any problem with Xiao Lu?

22:54.670 --> 22:55.470
tell me quickly

22:56.870 --> 22:57.710
I'm next to him

22:58.060 --> 22:58.820
do not worry

23:06.470 --> 23:07.060
I still have a job

23:07.260 --> 23:07.820
I go first

23:08.470 --> 23:08.990
round trip

23:26.780 --> 23:27.340
Hi-tech

23:32.870 --> 23:33.390
Come in

23:33.540 --> 23:34.260
Qin Chu, look for me

23:35.300 --> 23:37.190
This inspection report is out

23:37.710 --> 23:39.470
There's poison in this sake

23:43.910 --> 23:44.740
This Han Jie

23:45.430 --> 23:46.300
Desire to die

23:48.230 --> 23:49.710
Didn't give any clues

23:50.540 --> 23:51.910
Why does he want to die?

23:52.870 --> 23:53.500
perhaps

23:54.020 --> 23:54.740
Protect others

23:55.020 --> 23:55.630
Who?

23:56.230 --> 23:57.020
Chen Ting

23:57.300 --> 23:58.430
Then you find that between them

23:58.430 --> 24:00.340
Is there any close connection?

24:01.990 --> 24:03.740
There is no evidence yet

24:04.500 --> 24:05.740
But Han Jie and Chen Ting

24:06.020 --> 24:06.870
There are many intersections

24:08.190 --> 24:08.740
She knows Han Jie

24:08.910 --> 24:09.710
When I was a spy

24:09.950 --> 24:10.710
too calm

24:11.430 --> 24:12.630
It feels like I was prepared

24:13.390 --> 24:13.910
so what

24:14.230 --> 24:16.300
I paid attention to her movements

24:17.340 --> 24:18.990
I found out that she went to Yun Art Museum

24:19.540 --> 24:20.740
Cloud Art Museum

24:21.540 --> 24:22.580
Where is the legal person?

24:22.950 --> 24:23.580
It's Fang Lu

24:24.190 --> 24:25.300
Chen Ting also participated in the stock market

24:25.870 --> 24:26.300
Fang Lu

24:26.420 --> 24:27.470
Why do I hear this name?

24:27.820 --> 24:28.740
So familiar

24:28.990 --> 24:29.820
Fang Yongping's son

24:30.500 --> 24:31.390
Fang Yongping

24:32.060 --> 24:32.910
I know him

24:33.910 --> 24:35.300
He was the district mayor for the past two years

24:35.300 --> 24:36.740
He is now the deputy mayor

24:36.990 --> 24:37.910
Yes, that's him

24:40.670 --> 24:41.990
That means you doubt Chen Ting

24:42.060 --> 24:43.390
It's the boss Zhang behind him

24:44.580 --> 24:45.950
If she were Boss Zhang

24:47.390 --> 24:48.950
It would be too easy to kill Han Jie

24:49.190 --> 24:49.630
right

24:50.260 --> 24:51.340
As for Boss Zhang, she can’t be

24:51.470 --> 24:52.990
Such a loving person

24:54.820 --> 24:56.190
But this Chen Ting’s background

24:57.300 --> 24:58.230
It must not be simple

25:00.300 --> 25:01.100
Okay, go and do your work

25:02.060 --> 25:02.910
If you need anything, call me again

25:02.910 --> 25:03.300
good

25:14.580 --> 25:15.340
Where is sister?

25:16.950 --> 25:17.990
here here here

25:18.670 --> 25:19.230
Let's go

25:19.340 --> 25:20.000
What's wrong with the hand?

25:20.670 --> 25:21.340
How about going out to play?

25:21.340 --> 25:22.470
Came back like this

25:22.710 --> 25:23.580
Where is the boyfriend?

25:24.230 --> 25:24.870
Stop asking

25:25.020 --> 25:25.710
Very dizzy

25:25.910 --> 25:27.190
Okay, okay, don’t ask, don’t ask

25:29.190 --> 25:29.910
What do you want to eat?

25:30.300 --> 25:30.950
I'll make you some soup when I get back.

25:31.100 --> 25:31.710
Make some porridge

25:33.780 --> 25:34.500
I want to drink

25:35.950 --> 25:37.230
Isn't this hurtful?

25:37.870 --> 25:39.060
Are you sad?

25:40.230 --> 25:41.430
Don't talk nonsense. Are you going or not?

25:41.710 --> 25:42.670
Stay with me to the end

25:45.540 --> 25:46.740
I don't just want to drink

25:47.910 --> 25:48.820
I still want to hit someone

25:49.740 --> 25:50.260
You are like this now

25:50.470 --> 25:51.580
Who can you beat?

25:52.390 --> 25:53.020
Look at your face

25:53.100 --> 25:54.300
Lifeless look

25:54.910 --> 25:55.780
or

25:56.230 --> 25:57.260
Find an interesting place

25:57.390 --> 25:58.470
Take you to have fun

25:59.670 --> 26:00.190
Okay

26:00.430 --> 26:00.950
Walk

26:01.100 --> 26:02.190
Slow down

26:03.300 --> 26:04.910
What kind of injury is this?

26:05.950 --> 26:07.300
It couldn't have been the man who hit it, right?

26:07.780 --> 26:08.630
tell me the truth

26:08.670 --> 26:09.340
If it's really that man

26:09.340 --> 26:10.910
Didn’t you say that you didn’t say it?

26:11.780 --> 26:12.910
Where is your car parked?

26:13.300 --> 26:14.020
over there

26:16.340 --> 26:16.740
boarding

26:33.780 --> 26:34.340
Hello everyone

26:34.540 --> 26:36.430
Welcome to the talk show scene

26:38.670 --> 26:39.390
Just mentioned

26:39.470 --> 26:40.300
I am a Jiangxi person

26:40.470 --> 26:41.670
Everyone is on the streets of Jinhai

26:41.780 --> 26:42.780
Have you ever eaten Jiangxi food?

26:43.260 --> 26:43.710
No

26:43.710 --> 26:44.710
Give me a glass of Classic wine

26:45.190 --> 26:46.300
Give her a glass of orange juice

26:47.100 --> 26:47.740
Wait a minute

26:48.740 --> 26:49.670
give me a drink

26:50.430 --> 26:51.580
Stronger wine, thank you

26:52.190 --> 26:53.540
Then come and have a cup of bittersweetness

26:53.910 --> 26:54.580
Can

26:55.430 --> 26:56.780
How can you still drink like this?

26:57.190 --> 26:58.300
Alcohol sterilizes

26:59.300 --> 27:00.340
Can also tell cold jokes

27:00.540 --> 27:01.950
Explain that it's no big deal

27:02.910 --> 27:04.870
It wasn't a big deal to begin with.

27:05.950 --> 27:07.300
But that's it

27:08.100 --> 27:08.950
Lost in love

27:10.060 --> 27:12.340
A romantic getaway turns into a breakup trip

27:13.060 --> 27:14.820
You chose the place unluckily.

27:16.100 --> 27:17.630
It’s not that the place is unlucky

27:18.670 --> 27:20.230
I chose the wrong career

27:20.670 --> 27:22.300
What does this have to do with career?

27:22.710 --> 27:23.870
what does he do

27:24.910 --> 27:25.740
peers

27:26.710 --> 27:28.300
Hello, thank you for your hard work.

27:28.430 --> 27:28.910
Thanks

27:30.020 --> 27:31.340
hello your classic wine

27:32.300 --> 27:32.670
I said

27:32.670 --> 27:33.500
Brother, I will do it next time

27:33.500 --> 27:34.390
Bring a book with geography maps

27:34.670 --> 27:35.230
I said, brother, look

27:35.390 --> 27:36.230
This is Jiangxi

27:36.430 --> 27:37.340
This is Xiangxi

27:37.670 --> 27:39.060
Xiangni means Hunan

27:39.300 --> 27:40.470
The elder brother said that Hunan is Hunan

27:40.540 --> 27:41.670
Is that west Jiangxi?

27:50.540 --> 27:51.190
trouble

27:51.540 --> 27:52.390
One more drink, thank you

27:52.500 --> 27:53.020
two cups

27:55.670 --> 27:56.740
Colleagues are enemies

27:57.100 --> 27:57.870
But that's not the case

27:57.990 --> 27:59.500
Because we break up now

28:00.390 --> 28:01.340
Which company is he from?

28:01.710 --> 28:02.340
How about digging it for him?

28:02.430 --> 28:03.340
Our company is coming

28:06.950 --> 28:07.870
Too late

28:08.340 --> 28:10.000
This man is too cautious

28:11.580 --> 28:12.870
I lied to him

28:16.060 --> 28:17.780
I said I lied to him

28:19.020 --> 28:19.710
I started from the beginning

28:19.780 --> 28:20.670
Just didn't tell him

28:20.670 --> 28:21.740
what do i do

28:22.340 --> 28:24.020
Where is this going?

28:25.020 --> 28:26.020
What are we doing?

28:26.190 --> 28:27.630
A shady job

28:27.910 --> 28:28.870
You do not understand

28:30.260 --> 28:31.060
Have a drink

28:35.020 --> 28:35.500
elder sister

28:35.820 --> 28:37.230
Is this going to be bigger?

28:37.820 --> 28:39.300
If so, please let me know in advance.

28:39.300 --> 28:40.100
I'll bring a strong man to prepare

28:40.100 --> 28:41.060
Carry it back for you

28:41.390 --> 28:42.300
I'm so weak and boneless

28:42.500 --> 28:43.780
I can't carry you

28:44.260 --> 28:45.230
Do not worry

28:45.990 --> 28:46.910
I don't drink much

28:47.540 --> 28:48.670
Please have another drink. Thank you.

28:49.300 --> 28:50.100
Next we have a talk show

28:50.260 --> 28:51.060
There is a topic called

28:51.390 --> 28:53.190
lies in love

28:53.500 --> 28:53.990
Of course

28:54.060 --> 28:54.820
Some statistics say

28:54.910 --> 28:55.740
On average, boys every day

28:55.820 --> 28:56.580
Will lie six times

28:56.740 --> 28:58.300
Girls only pee three times

28:58.910 --> 28:59.780
Look at the young lady smiling

29:00.000 --> 29:00.820
Have you lied recently?

29:01.710 --> 29:02.710
There are also statistics saying that

29:02.990 --> 29:05.020
Saying that lies actually lead to

29:05.300 --> 29:07.260
The culprit of breakups

29:07.910 --> 29:08.430
certainly

29:08.580 --> 29:09.540
What if you didn't lie?

29:09.820 --> 29:10.870
Then you can divide it faster

29:14.710 --> 29:15.430
Is there any audience in the audience?

29:15.470 --> 29:16.580
Can you come on stage and share it?

29:16.580 --> 29:17.990
My own funny story

29:18.500 --> 29:19.060
Do you have

29:19.540 --> 29:20.500
Those who come on stage can be rewarded

29:20.630 --> 29:21.340
A glass of tequila

29:21.340 --> 29:23.740
Up up up up

29:23.990 --> 29:24.540
let's go

29:24.670 --> 29:25.430
Of course you can also do it on site

29:25.470 --> 29:26.710
Drink it and bring it back

29:28.990 --> 29:30.300
Encourage everyone to be brave enough to take the stage

29:30.670 --> 29:31.670
glass of tequila

29:32.190 --> 29:32.950
that

29:33.870 --> 29:34.470
I want to try

29:34.580 --> 29:35.300
We welcome with applause

29:35.300 --> 29:36.230
This brave girl

29:37.060 --> 29:37.740
What are you doing?

29:37.780 --> 29:38.230
Let me try

29:38.300 --> 29:39.190
Don't be impulsive

29:40.190 --> 29:41.020
If you want to beat him

29:41.060 --> 29:41.820
Go back and wait until he gets off work

29:41.870 --> 29:42.870
I'll get you a set of sacks

29:42.870 --> 29:44.020
It's not too late for you to beat him again

29:46.500 --> 29:47.060
You

29:47.500 --> 29:48.540
Don't worry

29:48.710 --> 29:49.470
I can't kill him

29:50.190 --> 29:51.470
Give this guy another round of applause

29:51.670 --> 29:53.670
Brave and beautiful young lady

30:03.020 --> 30:05.740
OK OK

30:14.300 --> 30:15.100
I show my hand

30:17.710 --> 30:19.100
Actually I'm a spy

30:22.630 --> 30:23.100
my boyfriend

30:23.100 --> 30:24.300
What's the reason for breaking up with me?

30:26.580 --> 30:28.260
Just because my identity was exposed

30:28.950 --> 30:29.500
I believe it

30:29.710 --> 30:30.780
There will definitely be someone at this time

30:30.950 --> 30:31.540
Want to ask

30:32.580 --> 30:34.190
What's wrong with being a spy?

30:34.500 --> 30:35.300
This is spying

30:35.470 --> 30:36.670
Does it affect falling in love?

30:36.990 --> 30:37.910
it is nothing more than a

30:38.060 --> 30:39.020
It's a dangerous profession

30:39.060 --> 30:39.820
right

30:40.060 --> 30:41.340
Actually I thought so too

30:42.470 --> 30:43.390
What did he say?

30:43.630 --> 30:45.230
he said very angrily

30:47.340 --> 30:48.260
He said I don't care

30:48.500 --> 30:50.000
are you a spy

30:51.100 --> 30:51.910
but you can't take me

30:52.100 --> 30:53.820
You're also dragging me down.

30:58.540 --> 30:59.340
two days ago

31:00.190 --> 31:00.950
Just out of town

31:00.950 --> 31:02.060
Made a big deal

31:06.430 --> 31:07.580
Don't laugh, handsome guy

31:08.740 --> 31:09.910
Are you in love?

31:11.820 --> 31:13.740
The kind that pulls you into the water

31:19.870 --> 31:20.710
Thank you everyone for coming

31:21.190 --> 31:22.190
I'm done with my jokes

31:25.910 --> 31:26.540
Thanks

31:26.740 --> 31:27.740
Another round of applause for this guy

31:27.870 --> 31:28.870
beautiful lady

31:31.470 --> 31:31.820
alright

31:31.820 --> 31:32.820
Our talk show ends here today

31:32.870 --> 31:33.670
It's over

31:33.780 --> 31:34.470
There's another one next

31:34.540 --> 31:36.470
The mysterious celebrity will appear

31:36.580 --> 31:37.060
Cool

31:37.060 --> 31:37.820
let's take a break

31:37.820 --> 31:38.540
goodbye

31:40.990 --> 31:41.710
I think

31:41.990 --> 31:43.430
You are particularly suitable for talk shows

31:45.430 --> 31:46.190
look

31:47.820 --> 31:49.300
Obviously what he said is the truth

31:50.820 --> 31:52.100
It sounds like a joke

32:03.230 --> 32:03.870
That’s all

32:03.950 --> 32:05.430
You're not still thinking about him, are you?

32:06.190 --> 32:06.740
what are you doing

32:11.190 --> 32:12.300
No one asked you to delete it

32:12.300 --> 32:14.060
You have been made abnormal by him

32:18.870 --> 32:19.430
Beauty

32:19.820 --> 32:20.710
can i buy you a drink

32:25.020 --> 32:25.710
roll

32:33.820 --> 32:34.390
I go first

32:37.100 --> 32:38.340
Your luggage is still in my car

32:39.190 --> 32:39.580
Pay the bill

33:30.260 --> 33:30.910
Sister Xi

33:32.500 --> 33:33.780
can i treat you to a meal

33:35.390 --> 33:36.060
what

33:38.260 --> 33:39.670
Thank you for your life-saving grace

33:40.950 --> 33:42.710
Let's talk to you by the way

33:45.910 --> 33:47.470
The moment I saw you in Macau

33:47.870 --> 33:48.990
I really feel like I've been saved

33:49.740 --> 33:51.060
you are like a savior

33:51.390 --> 33:52.300
I feel like you are behind this

33:52.390 --> 33:53.190
All with light

33:53.990 --> 33:55.470
Didn't I tell you?

33:55.630 --> 33:57.020
I will definitely protect your safety

33:58.580 --> 33:59.260
so

34:00.260 --> 34:01.300
I have to buy you a drink

34:02.060 --> 34:02.790
next time

34:04.220 --> 34:05.000
you are now

34:05.180 --> 34:06.580
Gold player in the game

34:06.950 --> 34:07.660
When we meet in the future

34:07.870 --> 34:08.620
Be cautious

34:14.020 --> 34:15.179
Those documents I took

34:15.500 --> 34:16.389
Have you dealt with everything?

34:17.219 --> 34:18.139
No big problem, right?

34:19.060 --> 34:20.139
Don't worry, it's no problem

34:21.350 --> 34:22.100
Then this matter

34:23.699 --> 34:24.429
Does my dad know?

34:25.310 --> 34:25.949
after you leave

34:26.020 --> 34:26.659
We have all the files

34:26.659 --> 34:27.179
Recovered

34:28.540 --> 34:29.500
That's good, that's good

34:30.989 --> 34:32.429
This is complicated enough

34:32.659 --> 34:33.949
Don't let him know

34:34.699 --> 34:35.989
Don't give it to him too

34:36.790 --> 34:37.469
Hasn't he already seen it?

34:37.500 --> 34:38.139
Yao Yao?

34:40.620 --> 34:41.989
You probably know everything, right?

34:43.350 --> 34:44.219
what do you know

34:48.310 --> 34:49.060
Yao Yao

34:50.750 --> 34:51.469
is a spy

34:53.060 --> 34:54.219
Didn't I remind you?

34:59.350 --> 35:00.270
She admitted it to you

35:04.180 --> 35:05.620
Just because of this matter, I took action

35:06.140 --> 35:07.220
That was an accident

35:09.060 --> 35:10.390
Why did you come back alone?

35:12.350 --> 35:13.350
Let's break up

35:14.660 --> 35:15.390
Both of us

35:16.060 --> 35:17.350
It's impossible to be together

35:26.420 --> 35:27.430
Why is she a spy?

35:27.910 --> 35:28.660
Have you been trained?

35:28.990 --> 35:29.470
What have you done

35:29.620 --> 35:30.270
Who is online

35:30.580 --> 35:31.470
Are there any other accomplices?

35:31.660 --> 35:32.580
Do you understand everything?

35:42.140 --> 35:43.430
You break up without knowing anything.

35:43.830 --> 35:44.390
You are assisting

35:44.540 --> 35:45.220
do we work

35:45.950 --> 35:46.500
Then I am

35:46.700 --> 35:47.830
You shouldn't break up with her

35:48.910 --> 35:51.140
The moment of pain after the truth is revealed

35:51.310 --> 35:52.750
Human nature is understandable

35:53.140 --> 35:54.950
But she has you under control

35:55.100 --> 35:56.470
You know nothing about her

35:56.830 --> 35:57.540
Is this appropriate?

35:57.910 --> 35:58.620
inappropriate

35:59.390 --> 36:00.060
But I can't go back

36:00.060 --> 36:00.830
Find her

36:12.470 --> 36:13.180
Don't you want to

36:13.350 --> 36:14.270
Know more about her?

36:15.620 --> 36:16.310
I know you still need it

36:16.470 --> 36:17.350
a little time

36:18.500 --> 36:19.870
Go back and have a good rest first

36:20.220 --> 36:20.790
Think about it carefully too

36:20.990 --> 36:22.140
What I just told you

36:23.430 --> 36:24.270
I know

36:24.500 --> 36:25.540
This journey is for you

36:25.540 --> 36:26.390
Quite difficult

36:28.220 --> 36:29.270
Be vigilant

36:29.700 --> 36:30.870
They will come to you again

36:31.910 --> 36:32.750
You are no longer a

36:32.950 --> 36:33.910
An ordinary player

36:34.060 --> 36:34.830
do you know

36:37.910 --> 36:38.540
Get off the car

36:41.390 --> 36:42.270
I haven't arrived yet

36:42.580 --> 36:43.270
I know

36:43.540 --> 36:44.270
Stay alert

37:23.020 --> 37:23.790
Are you getting ready to close?

37:25.220 --> 37:26.390
you are the last guest

37:27.950 --> 37:28.620
what do you want to eat

37:29.350 --> 37:30.540
But there aren’t many options left.

37:32.660 --> 37:33.700
Then you can eat whatever you want

37:35.220 --> 37:36.540
If you don't dislike it

37:36.990 --> 37:38.430
Come have a work lunch with me

37:39.390 --> 37:39.950
Can

37:40.580 --> 37:41.140
sit

37:56.540 --> 37:57.100
your work meal

37:57.310 --> 37:58.310
It’s too luxurious, right?

37:59.950 --> 38:00.500
All done

38:00.830 --> 38:01.660
Can't sell it tomorrow

38:02.270 --> 38:03.020
Can only eat by myself

38:07.950 --> 38:08.430
Is that right?

38:08.470 --> 38:09.580
I have to pay a share

38:10.020 --> 38:10.950
I can’t eat for free either.

38:12.310 --> 38:13.830
I don't think you're eating for free.

38:16.020 --> 38:16.830
Then I guess you

38:17.180 --> 38:18.180
Will ask next

38:18.700 --> 38:19.350
any drinks

38:20.430 --> 38:21.140
What to drink then?

38:21.950 --> 38:22.700
sake bar

38:23.220 --> 38:23.750
good

38:56.620 --> 38:58.060
So do you have any good recommendations?

39:00.020 --> 39:00.660
Then I decided

39:01.700 --> 39:02.270
Listen to you

39:02.790 --> 39:03.430
good

39:24.470 --> 39:24.910
good

39:25.390 --> 39:25.910
no problem

39:26.460 --> 39:27.660
Make an appointment to find a place

39:27.870 --> 39:28.430
I will look for you

39:29.910 --> 39:30.500
Something's wrong

39:32.100 --> 39:32.700
my brother

39:33.830 --> 39:34.500
Just came back

39:34.700 --> 39:35.580
Want to meet me

39:37.990 --> 39:38.790
You have a brother

39:40.220 --> 39:40.830
cousin

39:42.020 --> 39:42.990
We grew up together since childhood

39:43.990 --> 39:45.310
He's no different from his biological brother

39:46.620 --> 39:48.140
Then your relationship must be very good

39:48.750 --> 39:49.220
not good

39:49.950 --> 39:50.700
no tacit understanding

39:52.180 --> 39:53.580
We haven’t been able to play together since we were little

39:59.060 --> 39:59.750
But what happened later?

40:00.910 --> 40:02.140
Something happened to my family

40:03.310 --> 40:04.950
My father and mother are both gone

40:06.620 --> 40:07.830
I moved to my uncle's house

40:09.180 --> 40:10.100
that period of time

40:11.500 --> 40:13.020
I just want to be in the room by myself

40:13.620 --> 40:14.700
don't want to talk to anyone

40:16.390 --> 40:17.750
The two of us started to get acquainted

40:20.020 --> 40:21.310
The brother sleeping on the upper bunk

40:22.910 --> 40:24.500
I kept having nightmares during that time

40:25.790 --> 40:26.740
every time i wake up

40:27.180 --> 40:28.310
I saw him next to me

40:28.790 --> 40:30.270
Whisper a spell to me

40:31.060 --> 40:31.660
spell

40:32.430 --> 40:32.870
yes

40:33.220 --> 40:34.350
I didn't know until later

40:34.830 --> 40:36.350
That's Harry Potter's spell

40:36.910 --> 40:37.990
Summon the patron saint

40:39.060 --> 40:40.470
Resist those who try to take you

40:40.660 --> 40:42.060
A nightmare pulled into the abyss

40:44.180 --> 40:44.750
childish

40:45.220 --> 40:45.990
but it works

40:46.500 --> 40:47.140
yes

40:48.430 --> 40:49.020
Slowly

40:49.310 --> 40:50.660
I'm willing to communicate with people

40:52.140 --> 40:52.990
he's like

40:54.060 --> 40:55.100
Breaking my comfort zone

40:55.180 --> 40:56.060
alien visitor

40:57.060 --> 40:58.470
Suddenly broke into me and gave myself

40:59.060 --> 41:00.540
In that restricted world

41:01.540 --> 41:03.060
Pull me out forcefully

41:04.910 --> 41:05.700
perhaps

41:06.660 --> 41:07.700
It’s been a long time

41:08.470 --> 41:10.220
Some pains gradually fade away

41:11.620 --> 41:12.500
Or maybe

41:13.950 --> 41:15.000
He's such a chirper

41:15.310 --> 41:16.220
It's so noisy

41:16.870 --> 41:17.830
I have to speak

41:18.180 --> 41:18.990
to shut him up

41:20.950 --> 41:21.830
so cute

41:22.390 --> 41:23.580
He's not cute

41:24.140 --> 41:24.830
I say you

41:25.540 --> 41:26.060
I

41:27.870 --> 41:29.700
I rarely see you talk so much

41:34.180 --> 41:34.950
Have the opportunity

41:35.580 --> 41:37.540
Can you bring him here with you?

41:40.350 --> 41:42.180
He's been in some trouble lately

41:42.700 --> 41:43.750
What trouble

41:45.270 --> 41:46.500
All kinds of weird troubles

41:50.100 --> 41:50.870
Young people

41:51.220 --> 41:51.910
All like this

41:52.790 --> 41:54.310
You will always find your own direction

41:56.020 --> 41:56.830
yes

42:17.140 --> 42:17.910
It will be convenient for me in a while

42:17.950 --> 42:19.100
Do you want to pack a chicken rice?

42:20.750 --> 42:21.430
girlfriend

42:21.790 --> 42:23.390
It’s not appropriate to pack chicken rice, right?

42:23.750 --> 42:25.830
Then I'll make sushi

42:26.660 --> 42:28.060
Just chicken rice for colleagues

42:28.750 --> 42:29.270
Sure

42:29.790 --> 42:30.540
Sure
