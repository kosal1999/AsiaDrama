She doesn't answer my calls at all.

11:35.600 --> 11:36.460
Is there...something?

11:37.280 --> 11:38.680
I was both unemployed and heartbroken.

11:39.650 --> 11:40.100
I already know

11:40.130 --> 11:41.470
Come to me, there is nothing good.

11:41.850 --> 11:42.390
Come on, come on.

11:42.420 --> 11:43.070
what do you want to do?

11:43.700 --> 11:44.760
Want to do something?

11:45.930 --> 11:47.600
Be ready to serve until the end.

11:48.210 --> 11:48.700
very loyal

11:48.860 --> 11:49.760
enter the game

12:09.050 --> 12:10.060
Both unemployed and sad

12:10.100 --> 12:11.120
So what are you doing here?

12:11.690 --> 12:12.610
How do you find a job?

12:13.140 --> 12:14.540
What kind of jobs will there be here?

12:15.500 --> 12:16.860
I said I was useless.

12:17.180 --> 12:17.940
So I do it myself

12:17.980 --> 12:18.930
what's it for?

12:19.160 --> 12:20.200
Who says you are useless?

12:20.230 --> 12:20.850
Leave him alone.

12:21.880 --> 12:22.660
This is me.

12:24.100 --> 12:25.290
That being the case, so be it.

12:29.470 --> 12:30.160
What are you doing?

12:30.570 --> 12:31.750
Please lend me some money.

12:31.980 --> 12:32.830
what will you do?

12:33.500 --> 12:34.540
I'll ask for some information.

12:35.010 --> 12:36.210
I have wisdom.

12:36.300 --> 12:37.070
All kinds of gossip.

12:37.130 --> 12:38.140
What do you want to know?

12:39.060 --> 12:39.730
Zeyue

12:39.960 --> 12:40.730
What scandals does she have?

12:40.770 --> 12:42.130
Is it related to Zeyue?

12:42.770 --> 12:44.040
Is it Zeyue?

12:44.270 --> 12:45.790
I'd never really heard of it before.

12:48.430 --> 12:50.340
Otherwise, why don't you ask your boss?

12:50.680 --> 12:51.760
I think so.

12:51.850 --> 12:53.090
But I need the money.

12:54.600 --> 12:55.440
I have

12:55.620 --> 12:56.360
Go and ask.

12:56.900 --> 12:57.900
at important moments

12:58.270 --> 12:59.340
You are the person who supports me the most.

13:09.220 --> 13:10.110
what do you want?

13:14.730 --> 13:16.290
A cup of iced tea

13:18.020 --> 13:19.010
Two people, one drink?

13:20.510 --> 13:21.090
able

13:21.720 --> 13:22.630
A cup of iced tea

13:22.710 --> 13:23.240
able

13:27.010 --> 13:28.020
I don't want to drink.

13:28.700 --> 13:29.620
Will you gain intelligence?

13:31.260 --> 13:32.020
What are the rumors?

13:32.060 --> 13:33.430
Is it related to Zeyue?

13:33.990 --> 13:36.060
Zeyue allegedly sells user information.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.360
this is correct.

13:38.850 --> 13:39.650
Is there anything cheap?

13:40.300 --> 13:40.970
No.

13:41.560 --> 13:42.990
Is there any shape?

13:45.430 --> 13:46.490
So it's probably more than just price.

13:46.520 --> 13:47.830
Just a cup of cold black tea.

13:48.340 --> 13:49.070
how much does it cost?

13:51.860 --> 13:52.700
200 gold coins

13:53.420 --> 13:54.090
So expensive

13:54.130 --> 13:54.760
take

13:56.500 --> 13:58.520
It's really disrespectful to use other people's money.

13:59.830 --> 14:00.790
Pay here.

14:02.970 --> 14:03.650
Please hurry up.

14:05.770 --> 14:06.820
After finding the information

14:06.850 --> 14:08.080
I will send it to your email.

14:08.770 --> 14:09.300
Thanks.

14:09.330 --> 14:10.020
pleasure.

14:11.110 --> 14:12.010
The merit is so great that just saying thank you is not enough to make up for it.

14:12.010 --> 14:12.760
So I'm ready.

14:12.780 --> 14:13.390
Come on and take off your head.

14:13.710 --> 14:15.430
I don't have enough money to support you.

14:18.340 --> 14:19.320
Your iced tea.

14:21.450 --> 14:23.570
Your iced tea is too expensive.

14:23.680 --> 14:25.280
[Gold coins reduced by 200]

14:46.060 --> 14:47.450
People who have never exercised before

14:47.480 --> 14:48.860
Why did you suddenly think of exercising?

14:50.380 --> 14:51.760
I am getting fatter and fatter these days.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.180
I do not think so.

14:54.760 --> 14:55.950
I know the boss likes it too.

14:55.980 --> 14:57.260
Do you also exercise?

14:58.010 --> 14:58.850
What did you say?

14:59.730 --> 15:00.300
I know the boss likes it.

15:00.370 --> 15:01.650
Do you also exercise?

15:04.380 --> 15:05.500
he exercises

15:06.050 --> 15:07.620
And what does this have to do with me?

15:07.960 --> 15:09.490
My sixth sense is very accurate.

15:11.990 --> 15:12.920
You look like that.

15:14.290 --> 15:15.270
They also came to explore.

15:15.300 --> 15:16.420
In order to meet the boss accidentally

15:23.360 --> 15:24.910
A true corporate fitness center

15:25.390 --> 15:26.930
This is the biggest battlefield.

15:27.060 --> 15:27.910
that's right.

15:28.210 --> 15:29.030
if you get feelings

15:29.060 --> 15:30.180
Boss's

15:30.820 --> 15:32.320
Then I went to heaven.

15:32.460 --> 15:33.820
Do you know how rich he is?

15:35.450 --> 15:37.280
She's really cool. I can't see it at all.

15:37.850 --> 15:38.900
The boss has a treasure

15:39.260 --> 15:40.700
How much more does she know?

15:41.260 --> 15:42.480
The boss is very nice.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.250
Smart, handsome, rich.

Hello, Dean Zhou.

It's already here.

President Zhou

15:58.220 --> 15:58.770
Hello, Dean Zhou.

16:28.260 --> 16:29.380
I really can't stand it anymore, so I'm leaving first.

16:29.420 --> 16:30.070
OK

17:04.369 --> 17:05.150
President Zhou

17:05.520 --> 17:06.550
I've been running for a long time.

Too much is not good, take a rest.

17:35.380 --> 17:36.120
Do you want to go home?

17:36.200 --> 17:37.310
Yes, go home.

17:37.450 --> 17:39.100
It's time to get off work and it's hard to get a cab.

17:39.180 --> 17:40.150
I'll send you away right away.

17:41.880 --> 17:42.590
You don't have to do this.

17:42.620 --> 17:43.620
I can call a cab.

17:46.550 --> 17:48.410
if you continue to stand still

17:48.640 --> 17:49.800
A lot of people will see this.

18:12.010 --> 18:13.350
Are you in a bad mood?

18:17.580 --> 18:18.880
Is it that clear?

18:21.520 --> 18:23.600
Run on the treadmill like this.

18:23.790 --> 18:24.740
very clear.

18:27.330 --> 18:29.000
Now my whole body hurts.

18:29.570 --> 18:31.200
It doesn't matter, tomorrow will be more painful.

18:32.960 --> 18:34.340
Thank you, Principal Zhou, for your comfort.

18:37.500 --> 18:38.570
I feel uncomfortable.

18:38.930 --> 18:39.910
but sometimes

18:39.940 --> 18:41.220
If there are too many negative emotions

18:41.860 --> 18:43.190
It's just a waste of time.

18:43.820 --> 18:45.320
Doesn't solve any problems.

18:48.890 --> 18:49.860
But there is something.

18:49.860 --> 18:50.940
unsolvable

18:54.930 --> 18:55.720
So accept your fate.

18:55.740 --> 18:56.940
accept its existence

18:58.620 --> 18:59.980
Maybe some time has passed.

19:00.450 --> 19:02.300
Maybe there will be a new turning point.

is it here?

19:21.490 --> 19:22.150
Yes

Thank you, Principal Zhou.

19:24.530 --> 19:25.870
I received the instructions today.

19:26.260 --> 19:27.320
In fact, Yaoyao

Be a little more confident in yourself.

19:32.380 --> 19:33.170
I'm not flattering you.

20:25.330 --> 20:26.840
I also want to retire after success.

20:26.990 --> 20:28.350
But the potential was not given.

20:29.890 --> 20:30.500
Come on, come on.

20:34.950 --> 20:36.060
I would like to know

Let’s be clear.

20:41.570 --> 20:42.560
this morning

20:42.630 --> 20:43.590
Gao Tianyang asked me.

20:43.650 --> 20:45.210
Become a Zeyue user?

20:45.570 --> 20:46.570
He would never ask me such a boring question.

20:46.620 --> 20:47.980
no reason

20:48.730 --> 20:49.320
So, Zeyue

20:49.320 --> 20:50.250
It must be related to this case.

20:51.040 --> 20:51.660
after that

20:51.660 --> 20:52.140
I saw Zeyue’s account.

20:52.180 --> 20:53.730

20:58.220 --> 20:59.650
This suddenly occurred to me.

21:00.070 --> 21:01.860
These two people are related.

21:03.530 --> 21:05.130
Then I got into the game.

21:05.280 --> 21:06.640
Inquire about Ze Yue’s gossip

21:06.810 --> 21:07.660
Guess what it looks like?

21:08.110 --> 21:09.800
Don't be arrogant and speak up.

21:14.380 --> 21:15.230
Isn't it?

21:19.860 --> 21:21.090
Then drag it into the game.

21:31.980 --> 21:33.540
You already knew that, right?

21:36.930 --> 21:38.010
This is just your guess.

21:38.010 --> 21:38.900
Not even any evidence.

21:40.230 --> 21:41.270
Indeed there is.

WHO？

21:59.930 --> 22:01.100
One of my friends said...

22:01.140 --> 22:01.770
Jiang Xiaohua

22:02.780 --> 22:03.440
Yes

22:03.700 --> 22:04.490
That's Jiang Xiaohua.

22:05.380 --> 22:06.580
Him and the crow.

22:15.940 --> 22:16.940
Isn't this a scam?

22:16.980 --> 22:17.570
Yes

22:17.730 --> 22:19.090
So Jiang Xiaohua stopped doing this later.

22:19.220 --> 22:19.780
But this crow

22:19.810 --> 22:20.770
Looks like he's still doing it.

22:21.770 --> 22:22.420
You've figured out how to make an appointment.

22:22.490 --> 22:23.380
Can this person come out?

22:24.680 --> 22:25.630
They refused to meet.

22:25.660 --> 22:26.700
Offline.

22:26.720 --> 22:27.730
You can go online.

But I go shopping online and offline to eat.

22:53.380 --> 22:54.530
You can free yourself.

22:54.570 --> 22:54.900
I am sure

22:54.940 --> 22:56.240
I want to come back again.

23:03.690 --> 23:04.380
I have seen

23:04.450 --> 23:05.530
The world of espionage has arrived.

23:06.780 --> 23:07.730
inability to act like one

23:07.810 --> 23:08.980
I do not know anything.

23:11.330 --> 23:12.380
I think...

23:13.020 --> 23:14.600
I myself have an important mission.

23:16.210 --> 23:16.910
Do you believe?

23:18.390 --> 23:19.060
I believe this.

23:22.020 --> 23:23.100
So you say this is my awakening.

23:23.140 --> 23:24.440
Can you be my colleague?

23:25.230 --> 23:25.930
Too much.

23:27.080 --> 23:27.940
Do not do this.

23:28.170 --> 23:29.110
Please give me a chance.

23:29.180 --> 23:31.210
The road is still long. Please take your time.

23:31.620 --> 23:32.490
find the crow

23:32.490 --> 23:33.490
Then get the information in his hand first.

23:33.850 --> 23:34.410
Yes

23:56.100 --> 23:57.160
Are you a crow?

23:58.910 --> 24:00.790
Do you want to buy the news in my hand?

24:04.450 --> 24:05.390
Yes, it's me.

24:07.350 --> 24:07.860
Please tell me the information you have previously.

24:07.860 --> 24:09.380

24:10.600 --> 24:12.010
all the time

24:12.050 --> 24:12.700
Zeyue revealed the information.

24:23.980 --> 24:25.480
in all privacy policies

24:25.560 --> 24:26.860
That part should be kept secret.

24:27.490 --> 24:28.260
Zeyue

24:28.290 --> 24:29.780
Instead, he took it and revealed it to

24:29.800 --> 24:30.650
third person

24:31.230 --> 24:33.030
I have strong evidence.

24:33.480 --> 24:35.110
How much do you plan to sell this information for?

24:36.550 --> 24:38.040
500,000 gold coins

24:42.300 --> 24:44.020
Then I might have to check that out first.

24:44.910 --> 24:45.350
I do not want

24:45.380 --> 24:46.730
So much money wasted.

24:47.430 --> 24:48.180
just to get

24:48.220 --> 24:49.520
Rumors spread without any evidence.

24:50.180 --> 24:51.160
Definitely.

24:51.860 --> 24:53.720
No one wants to pay an unfair price.

24:55.270 --> 24:56.960

This information will be lost.

25:50.020 --> 25:51.760
Do not let third parties know.

25:52.440 --> 25:53.780
This is called the rule among thieves.

25:54.710 --> 25:56.480
Actual disclosure of user information

25:56.830 --> 25:57.810
This is the secret of this business.

25:57.810 --> 25:58.980
As we all know, we just don’t say it out loud.

26:00.030 --> 26:00.700
In big data warehouse

26:00.730 --> 26:01.800

26:04.980 --> 26:05.910
What's the threat?

26:05.940 --> 26:07.220
Zeyue can't do it.

26:08.880 --> 26:09.940
If the other end of the fiber optic cable

26:09.960 --> 26:11.460
Connect to server

26:11.460 --> 26:12.660
is an external company

26:13.530 --> 26:14.800
This shows that Zeyue did it on purpose.

26:14.860 --> 26:16.220
Disclose information

26:16.460 --> 26:18.020
This is dangerous for data security.

26:19.420 --> 26:21.120
I don't care if you are from Zeyue or not.

26:21.560 --> 26:22.770
or his competitors

26:23.790 --> 26:25.360
The value of this information

26:25.660 --> 26:27.620
There are as many as half a million gold coins.

26:32.260 --> 26:34.040
I'll give you half of the deposit first.

26:34.460 --> 26:35.590
remaining money

I need time to prepare.

I'll give you three days at most.

26:38.870 --> 26:39.410
no problem

26:40.340 --> 26:42.070
But to express your sincerity

26:42.660 --> 26:44.560
You must shoot the video immediately.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.010
give me a set

26:46.750 --> 26:48.310
And don't post it.

27:03.900 --> 27:04.970
There is no such person

He is a skilled man.

I feel like he did it just for the money.

27:45.220 --> 27:46.220
money is not a problem

27:47.670 --> 27:49.340

Zeyue has a problem.

30:26.370 --> 30:26.810
Yes

30:29.490 --> 30:31.280
So you went to say hello to him.

30:31.880 --> 30:34.020
Ask him if he has an account in Zeyue.

30:34.970 --> 30:36.180
He is very sensitive.

30:36.520 --> 30:37.420
If I say Zeyue

30:37.460 --> 30:38.220
He must be thinking.

30:43.420 --> 30:43.900
So I will go into detail about the circumstances of the case.

30:43.940 --> 30:45.380
You can't tell him everything either.

30:46.340 --> 30:47.630
Although he is my brother.

30:47.940 --> 30:48.620
I think it's you.

But before that I wanted to convince him to leave.

Now that he's here, I want to use him again.

31:24.540 --> 31:26.440
Why do I have a feeling of disbelief?

31:26.930 --> 31:28.500
If I lied to you, I wanted you to be a dog.

31:29.660 --> 31:30.700
Then you hand it over to a big buyer.

31:30.730 --> 31:32.180

34:13.429 --> 34:14.460
Total revenue

34:14.489 --> 34:15.690
Including benefits.

34:15.719 --> 34:17.170
You can go talk to HR.

34:22.350 --> 34:23.770
Thank you Dean Zhou for your trust.

34:24.100 --> 34:24.739
But I've never had a job.

34:24.780 --> 34:26.510
I was actually an assistant before.

34:27.130 --> 34:28.420
I do not believe

34:28.460 --> 34:29.780
There will be free lunch.

34:30.429 --> 34:31.840
You suddenly promoted me.

34:31.870 --> 34:33.179
My heart feels unstable.

34:34.639 --> 34:36.130
Can I ask you something?

34:36.270 --> 34:37.360
What is the reason for this?

34:38.530 --> 34:39.310
You have to be careful here

34:39.340 --> 34:40.380
Really good.

34:41.250 --> 34:42.949
I know mine well.

34:43.420 --> 34:44.270
this story

34:44.340 --> 34:45.980
Maybe I really didn't do a good job.

34:47.080 --> 34:48.179
my daily routine

34:48.210 --> 34:49.650
My secretary will take care of it.

34:49.989 --> 34:51.440
What you need to do is very simple.

34:52.010 --> 34:53.380
It's to deal with special things

34:53.400 --> 34:54.290
something

34:56.389 --> 34:57.390
Is there anything special?

34:58.960 --> 34:59.810
looking for worms

35:00.320 --> 35:00.860
Is it intestinal worms?

35:02.440 --> 35:03.090
During this time

35:03.090 --> 35:04.380
An anonymous person is blackmailing me.

35:04.480 --> 35:05.940
Said he had evidence in our company.

35:05.940 --> 35:07.100
Information is disclosed.

35:07.280 --> 35:07.860
This news

35:07.900 --> 35:08.990
if dropped

35:09.090 --> 35:09.730
will have a negative impact

35:09.780 --> 35:11.610
Heavyweight for our company

35:14.140 --> 35:15.680
Then why should you choose me?

35:16.050 --> 35:17.900
Because I already checked.

35:18.210 --> 35:19.050
This person is most likely

35:19.090 --> 35:20.380
It will come from your product department.

35:21.340 --> 35:22.340
Is it our department?

35:22.530 --> 35:23.040
Yes

35:26.060 --> 35:27.210
if it is like this

35:27.260 --> 35:28.470
I was also under suspicion.

35:30.740 --> 35:31.830
But I know that's not you.

35:34.050 --> 35:34.650
Why

35:35.690 --> 35:36.570
Because I know the goal

35:36.570 --> 35:37.750
You came to my company

35:37.820 --> 35:38.940
You're not here to threaten me.

35:39.290 --> 35:40.030
And one more thing.

35:40.530 --> 35:41.260
your answer just now

35:41.300 --> 35:42.940
My decision has been confirmed.

35:43.390 --> 35:44.300
if it were you

35:44.730 --> 35:45.830
You probably wouldn't ask me first.

35:45.940 --> 35:46.530
Why did I kill you?

35:46.570 --> 35:47.890
leave a suspect

35:48.260 --> 35:49.660
Instead, I will thank you for your trust in me.

35:50.110 --> 35:50.590
Is it right?

35:54.140 --> 35:55.370
Thank you Dean Zhou for your trust.

35:57.200 --> 35:58.540
Overall revenue will double.

35:58.570 --> 35:59.130
if you do well

35:59.150 --> 35:59.800
There will also be bonuses.

36:00.730 --> 36:01.920
I believe you will not reject me.

36:06.520 --> 36:07.780
So how can I find the answer?

36:08.820 --> 36:09.860
This is the second reason.

36:09.900 --> 36:10.610
I'll call you

36:11.470 --> 36:12.440
Let's sit down and talk.

36:17.890 --> 36:18.680
You say come on.

36:21.030 --> 36:22.010
this person

36:22.270 --> 36:23.490
This could be someone you know.

36:24.680 --> 36:26.310
You worked overtime last Thursday night, right?

36:27.240 --> 36:27.910
until late at night

36:31.280 --> 36:32.670
last Friday

36:32.740 --> 36:33.650
Have a project plan.

36:33.690 --> 36:34.780
must be reported

36:35.630 --> 36:37.300
It's a Thursday night, so it gets really busy until late.

36:38.090 --> 36:39.420
The person who was working overtime with you at the time.

36:39.460 --> 36:40.000
do you remember?

36:41.940 --> 36:43.350
Captain Wang

36:43.500 --> 36:44.540
Then there is Siqi

36:49.190 --> 36:50.250
Do you remember this person?

36:55.390 --> 36:56.490
It was already too dark.

36:56.520 --> 36:58.140
I was also wearing a hat and couldn't see very clearly.

36:58.670 --> 37:00.230
I think he is more like Director Wang.

37:00.310 --> 37:01.790
Or is he more like Zhou Siqi?

37:02.010 --> 37:03.420
Suki seems to have

37:03.440 --> 37:04.590
A matching hoodie.

37:05.370 --> 37:06.960
But there are many similar designs.

37:06.990 --> 37:08.270
I...I can't confirm.

37:09.050 --> 37:10.710
Your job is to make things unconfirmable.

37:10.780 --> 37:12.090
It has become something that can be confirmed.

37:15.980 --> 37:17.330
Are you doubting Siqi?

37:17.480 --> 37:17.890
Yes

37:19.350 --> 37:20.420
not him.

37:21.380 --> 37:22.720
Why is this impossible?

37:22.750 --> 37:23.730
Do you know him well?

37:24.610 --> 37:26.070
We have been working together for a long time.

37:26.170 --> 37:27.420
What's more, the relationship is not bad at all.

37:27.440 --> 37:28.480
Why is this so?

37:29.370 --> 37:30.650
Do you know where he is?

37:31.780 --> 37:32.270
After get off work

37:32.300 --> 37:33.300
What did he do?

37:33.300 --> 37:34.640
Or what have you done before?

37:34.820 --> 37:35.300
did you know?

37:39.940 --> 37:41.130
No one knows the other person.

37:41.130 --> 37:41.940
completely fine.

37:42.380 --> 37:43.300
You never really know the face.

37:43.380 --> 37:44.610
Another person under the surface image

37:44.700 --> 37:45.530
external

37:48.870 --> 37:50.380
I will grant you login access.

37:50.400 --> 37:51.480
The company's human resources department is with you

37:52.080 --> 37:52.980
all his information

37:53.010 --> 37:54.050
You can find it here.

37:56.980 --> 37:57.530
Yes

37:58.250 --> 37:59.180
this matter

37:59.210 --> 38:00.420
I need to find a quiet place

38:00.480 --> 38:01.890
Don't let others know.

38:04.620 --> 38:05.230
I see.

38:08.420 --> 38:09.210
So, what about Dean Zhou?

38:09.610 --> 38:10.860
Can I ask you a question?

38:10.900 --> 38:11.170
ask me.

38:12.880 --> 38:14.740
Evidence of company disclosures

38:14.780 --> 38:16.660
The information in this person's hands

38:17.080 --> 38:18.120
is this real?

38:21.380 --> 38:22.500
I think this sentence has given away.

38:22.530 --> 38:23.660
This is not very accurate.

38:24.200 --> 38:25.210
data analysis

38:25.260 --> 38:26.380
User news

38:26.400 --> 38:27.490
This is something that every platform has.

38:27.490 --> 38:28.210
They all do it.

38:28.620 --> 38:29.850
We, Zeyue, have also worked together.

38:29.980 --> 38:31.610
with data analytics companies

38:31.610 --> 38:32.640
same

38:34.000 --> 38:35.560
Is the company analyzing data?

38:35.670 --> 38:36.330
Yes

38:36.700 --> 38:38.050
Show ads based on your interests

38:38.090 --> 38:39.050
and different needs

38:39.130 --> 38:40.100
Customer's

38:40.200 --> 38:40.860
It’s not just Zeyue.

38:40.900 --> 38:41.890
Every website does this.

38:43.250 --> 38:44.600
when this happens

38:44.870 --> 38:46.600
Then why can he still blackmail you?

38:51.840 --> 38:52.780
our company

38:52.810 --> 38:54.170
No intention to disclose information

38:54.240 --> 38:55.370
This is the user's.

38:56.070 --> 38:57.760
But in the data management process

38:57.890 --> 38:58.940
We do not rule out this possibility.

38:58.970 --> 39:00.610
the information will be disclosed or

39:00.650 --> 39:01.530
the emergence of circumstances

39:01.920 --> 39:02.980
This matter has been announced

39:03.010 --> 39:04.010
Can not Go Out.

39:04.550 --> 39:05.300
every company

39:05.300 --> 39:06.340
Each of them has their own secret.

39:07.370 --> 39:08.360
The same goes for our company.

39:11.130 --> 39:12.780
Yes, I understand.

39:33.500 --> 39:34.150
Tell me honestly.

39:39.630 --> 39:41.250
Do you really care about the boss that much?

39:41.270 --> 39:42.150
Of course.

39:42.680 --> 39:43.810
Rich single man

39:43.990 --> 39:45.080
Who would say no?

39:45.280 --> 39:45.890
Say it quickly.

39:45.920 --> 39:46.610
Why is he looking for you?

39:47.970 --> 39:49.080
Let me move the position a little bit.

39:49.120 --> 39:50.000
where are you going?

39:51.690 --> 39:52.600
Assistant to the President

39:53.020 --> 39:54.320
I already told you.

39:54.350 --> 39:55.430
He likes you.

39:56.030 --> 39:56.740
I probably won't be

39:56.780 --> 39:57.740
If you are already old, right?

39:58.280 --> 40:00.560
Don't talk nonsense.

40:01.970 --> 40:02.910
Maybe it's because of what I usually see.

40:02.940 --> 40:04.210
I'm so free.

40:04.400 --> 40:06.900
So I'm hoping my work will increase, that's it.

40:07.120 --> 40:07.900
What kind of job is this?

40:08.500 --> 40:10.120
He didn't make any special arrangements.

40:10.140 --> 40:11.140
Let me continue first.

40:11.660 --> 40:13.290
Then I must seize the opportunity.

40:13.600 --> 40:15.190
From now on, if you become the boss,

40:15.740 --> 40:16.770
do not forget me.

40:19.370 --> 40:20.940
If I really were this boss

40:20.970 --> 40:22.150
The first person I want to fire is you.

40:22.210 --> 40:22.780
I already know

40:22.810 --> 40:24.390
This guy is so thoughtful that he forgot his friends.

40:26.690 --> 40:27.670
Siqi

40:28.850 --> 40:29.880
Please come to the office.

40:30.030 --> 40:30.660
I have arrived.

40:38.930 --> 40:45.360
[Avril Lavigne]

40:44.010 --> 40:44.900
Has everyone finished eating?

40:45.000 --> 40:46.280
Okay, okay.

40:46.530 --> 40:47.110
There's not much left.

40:47.260 --> 40:48.570
This is incompatible with not wasting food at all.

40:49.170 --> 40:49.890
Come

40:50.170 --> 40:50.830
Let's drink.

40:51.170 --> 40:51.980
Let's drink.

40:52.420 --> 40:52.860
Come

40:56.470 --> 40:57.240
How are you eating?

40:57.270 --> 40:58.050
Are you satisfied?

40:58.210 --> 40:59.130
Very cool.

41:00.310 --> 41:01.540
Today I am a nanny.

41:01.710 --> 41:02.230
Yes

41:08.330 --> 41:09.400
alright.

41:09.530 --> 41:10.630
Same rules.

41:10.690 --> 41:11.300
old rules

41:11.470 --> 41:11.960
Yes

41:14.420 --> 41:15.540
What secret signal is this?

41:15.610 --> 41:16.490
There are still old rules.

41:16.590 --> 41:17.370
that's right.

41:17.780 --> 41:18.760
Recharge three thousand

41:18.860 --> 41:19.650
20% discount on food costs

41:19.760 --> 41:20.660
Give me another bottle of wine.

41:20.680 --> 41:21.690
I don't drink anymore.

41:21.720 --> 41:22.510
Let's leave it here.

41:22.640 --> 41:23.650
Come and drink next time.

41:23.820 --> 41:24.310
OK

41:24.370 --> 41:25.510
I'm afraid my son will see it.

41:26.470 --> 41:27.420
This is you.

41:27.480 --> 41:28.820
let's go.

41:29.340 --> 41:30.130
have a nice trip.

41:30.420 --> 41:30.870
OK

41:30.980 --> 41:31.730
See you later.

41:31.780 --> 41:32.380
OK, thanks.

41:41.520 --> 41:50.550
[Avril Lavigne]

41:58.010 --> 41:58.690
It will be me.

41:59.080 --> 41:59.810
It will be me.

42:00.670 --> 42:01.360
I'll give it to my boss.

42:01.390 --> 42:02.540
How can you come down?

42:03.400 --> 42:04.760
While in Japan

42:04.870 --> 42:06.450
I've had jobs that were more tiring than this.

42:07.870 --> 42:09.050
You go do something else.

42:10.270 --> 42:10.840
Yes
