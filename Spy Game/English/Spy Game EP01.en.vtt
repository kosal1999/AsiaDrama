Puzzled?

05:03.560 --> 05:04.070

07:24.680 --> 07:25.720
I don't want to get caught by the government

07:27.510 --> 07:28.680
I didn't say anything

07:29.920 --> 07:30.830
The dead are safest

07:34.480 --> 07:35.040
if they catch me

07:35.240 --> 07:36.830
There's nothing they can do, really.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.120
Don't shoot, please don't shoot

08:08.750 --> 08:09.310

08:15.950 --> 08:16.680
We had a good chat.

08:17.630 --> 08:18.270

09:39.840 --> 09:40.750
As long as you cooperate

09:40.750 --> 09:41.510
If you find someone better

09:44.510 --> 09:45.720
you know very well

09:50.670 --> 09:51.510
Get off work early

09:52.510 --> 09:53.480
I don't want to waste time either

09:57.120 --> 09:58.200
I just take care of my stuff

09:59.270 --> 10:00.510
I don't know what else

10:01.150 --> 10:02.670
You know who wants to kill you

10:03.270 --> 10:04.390

10:10.150 --> 10:11.080
Who is your boss?

10:15.600 --> 10:16.870
The manager is my superior.

10:17.510 --> 10:18.080
usually

10:18.200 --> 10:19.030
This is my mission

10:19.440 --> 10:20.030
This item

10:20.120 --> 10:20.960
Where did you get it?

10:21.510 --> 10:22.390
Who are the visitors?

10:23.600 --> 10:25.440
These items were brought from Zhenhai Library.

10:26.240 --> 10:27.510
The interviewer really doesn't know.

10:27.670 --> 10:28.870
I've never really seen it

10:29.200 --> 10:30.240
But I have his phone number.

10:35.630 --> 10:36.510
Have you contacted the professor?

10:37.320 --> 10:37.910
I'm with them

10:38.000 --> 10:39.080

but I

10:47.480 --> 10:48.670
I registered his game account.

10:48.870 --> 10:49.910
It has been canceled

10:51.240 --> 10:53.320
The other party responded quickly

10:54.080 --> 10:54.790
this is what it looks like

10:54.870 --> 10:55.870
I'm playing a game

10:56.080 --> 10:56.910
I don't believe anything

10:58.320 --> 11:00.000
That's right, he's here again

11:00.630 --> 11:01.510

11:07.600 --> 11:08.960
what game is this?

11:09.390 --> 11:10.120
The question is

11:10.120 --> 11:11.440
I just found someone who can answer

11:11.480 --> 11:11.790
Director Jin

11:12.360 --> 11:12.840
Director Jin

Wuxi tide

11:17.840 --> 11:19.030
Special attack game case

11:19.670 --> 11:20.120
It's already raining

11:20.120 --> 11:21.150
I've been following you for a while

11:21.720 --> 11:22.600
Next

11:22.790 --> 11:24.120
Let Wuxi introduce it to you.

11:24.750 --> 11:25.080
is that so

11:25.240 --> 11:25.790
OK

11:25.790 --> 11:26.430
Sit morning and evening

11:31.200 --> 11:31.840
Do you need a computer?

11:37.390 --> 11:38.200
The special mission is

11:39.270 --> 11:40.550
Developed abroad

11:40.550 --> 11:41.360
Online game

11:41.870 --> 11:42.550

11:42.600 --> 11:44.200
It's been running for a while.

11:44.670 --> 11:45.600
Virtual Special Forces World

11:45.600 --> 11:47.000
We created a virtual world of Special Forces.

11:47.080 --> 11:48.440
Attracted many players

11:49.120 --> 11:49.840
But this game

11:49.840 --> 11:51.200
The man behind the scenes is

11:51.270 --> 11:53.790
Awesome spy organization Yamu

11:54.320 --> 11:55.720
In the name of the game they

11:55.910 --> 11:57.200
Tempt and engage players

11:57.240 --> 11:58.750
espionage

11:59.510 --> 12:01.240
At the same time, it is also night fog

12:01.440 --> 12:02.510
This is how we choose new spies.

12:02.600 --> 12:03.320
are you ready?

12:03.790 --> 12:04.550
Yes

12:07.000 --> 12:08.910
Game is special attack

12:09.320 --> 12:10.960
rather than a game

12:11.150 --> 12:11.790
more

12:12.000 --> 12:13.600
It's like a virtual special forces world

12:13.840 --> 12:14.600
attract targets

12:14.790 --> 12:15.790

12:16.000 --> 12:17.390
interested young people

12:17.960 --> 12:19.840
Although this is an important game

12:20.150 --> 12:21.360
Currently, global users

12:21.550 --> 12:23.120
Still increasing

12:23.440 --> 12:24.200

15:22.720 --> 15:23.870
Can I get premium assignments?

15:24.270 --> 15:25.080
admit defeat

15:25.080 --> 15:25.790
Bring it quickly

15:30.550 --> 15:31.630
Let's go on a high level mission.

15:32.480 --> 15:33.480
Let me think.

15:34.080 --> 15:35.600
When it comes to making money, what are you worried about?

21:01.030 --> 21:03.270
You have been qualified to participate in offline mission challenges

But the game content is

21:13.000 --> 21:14.160
always keep things mysterious

21:14.960 --> 21:16.030
Ace special attack

21:16.030 --> 21:16.720
person who gets this position

21:17.070 --> 21:18.720
You will become a legend in the game

21:18.960 --> 21:20.510
Many gamers were also attracted.

21:20.640 --> 21:21.070
that's right

21:21.070 --> 21:21.510
secret

21:22.110 --> 21:23.720
Offline games are full of yearning

21:24.590 --> 21:25.680
100,000 bonus

21:27.000 --> 21:28.310
But the players don’t know

21:28.680 --> 21:29.510
them

21:29.590 --> 21:30.880
When you start an offline game

21:31.270 --> 21:32.200
they already

21:32.200 --> 21:33.550
They said it was captured by the Nightmist group.

21:34.160 --> 21:34.960
Which

21:35.200 --> 21:37.000
A person who has obtained the special attack ace level

21:37.830 --> 21:38.960
About nightlife organizations

21:39.110 --> 21:40.680
He is a very valuable person.

21:41.480 --> 21:42.510
The Anglican Church has

21:42.550 --> 21:43.240
this game

21:44.030 --> 21:44.830
i have a mission

21:45.720 --> 21:46.440
Deeper into the game

21:46.830 --> 21:48.310
Investigate the players involved

21:48.830 --> 21:49.920
In Zhenhai

21:50.200 --> 21:51.510
drag away

21:51.790 --> 21:52.640
Ace special attack

21:53.070 --> 21:53.720
code

21:54.510 --> 21:55.110
professor

21:55.920 --> 21:57.070
In the hands of Du Tao

21:57.200 --> 21:57.960
that information

21:58.070 --> 21:59.350
All provided by professors.

21:59.920 --> 22:00.480
Yes

22:00.960 --> 22:02.110
So what kind of character is Du Tao?

22:02.480 --> 22:03.920
Du Tao is just an ordinary game player.

22:04.110 --> 22:05.240
Game numbers have depth

22:05.680 --> 22:06.480
After development

22:06.590 --> 22:07.790
Transport information

22:08.920 --> 22:10.350
Professor Li in the competition

22:10.510 --> 22:11.110
Faceless

22:11.310 --> 22:12.830
No contact with other players

22:13.160 --> 22:14.310
find professor

22:14.680 --> 22:15.440
in game

22:15.510 --> 22:16.440
I started contacting Dudo.

22:16.640 --> 22:17.240
his

22:17.400 --> 22:18.350
Find basic information

22:18.830 --> 22:19.830
Step by step

22:20.000 --> 22:20.750
in real life

22:20.830 --> 22:21.640
identity

22:22.350 --> 22:23.270
Du Duo's actions are

22:23.480 --> 22:24.310
arrested professor

22:24.550 --> 22:25.720
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

22:26.110 --> 22:26.960
so we follow him

22:27.000 --> 22:28.680
I came to Zhenhai Library

22:31.070 --> 22:32.240
the woman on the screen

22:32.440 --> 22:33.310
Just in two ditches

22:33.400 --> 22:34.920
A person who obtains information from a library

22:37.510 --> 22:38.270
Is this person a professor?

22:38.720 --> 22:39.350
Yes

22:39.960 --> 22:40.720
But unfortunately

22:41.160 --> 22:42.680
CCTV footage cannot be captured

22:42.880 --> 22:43.680
I can't find any features about her

22:44.160 --> 22:44.830
with her

22:45.000 --> 22:45.640
Library Roadmap

22:45.830 --> 22:47.070
I stepped on it early.

22:47.440 --> 22:48.200
So I didn't find it

22:48.400 --> 22:49.200
i can't find it

22:50.400 --> 22:51.240
I have another question

22:51.550 --> 22:52.160
explain

22:52.720 --> 22:54.200
Du Tao said he gave me a mission.

22:54.400 --> 22:55.640
That person's name is President Zhang.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.270
So who is this business owner?

22:57.880 --> 22:58.720
And Boss Zhang

22:58.880 --> 23:00.200
This is a character in the game.

23:00.720 --> 23:01.310
we are

23:01.510 --> 23:02.510
Behind the Gamers

23:02.720 --> 23:04.070
There is a trace of President Jang there.

23:04.590 --> 23:05.400
so

23:05.750 --> 23:06.880
President Zhang in the night fog.

23:06.880 --> 23:07.790
Addicted to the game

23:07.830 --> 23:08.750
VIP

23:09.070 --> 23:10.110
he played the game

23:10.230 --> 23:11.310
Monitor players

23:11.350 --> 23:12.310
We are announcing orders from behind the scenes.

23:13.480 --> 23:14.030
So this professor

23:14.200 --> 23:14.920
Has he improved?

23:14.920 --> 23:15.400
Yes

23:15.720 --> 23:16.680
so we

23:16.920 --> 23:18.160
In Zhenhai

23:18.310 --> 23:19.720
Hide strict spy sites

23:20.160 --> 23:21.030
President Li Zhang

23:21.200 --> 23:22.270
I'm responsible for the Internet.

23:22.920 --> 23:23.830
all

23:23.880 --> 23:25.240
Are you a person in the game?

23:25.400 --> 23:26.960
So in real life

23:27.160 --> 23:28.160
Probably in Zhenhai.

23:29.160 --> 23:29.680
that's right

23:29.830 --> 23:30.480
so now

23:30.480 --> 23:31.200
we are

23:31.200 --> 23:32.720
I had no choice but to start with the hidden spy player

23:35.160 --> 23:36.750
I have received instructions from my superiors.

23:37.240 --> 23:38.160
A dedicated team has been established

23:39.200 --> 23:39.880
I will be the team leader.

23:40.750 --> 23:41.920
About special attack game

23:42.240 --> 23:43.480
We are conducting a comprehensive investigation

23:44.550 --> 23:45.790
Professor Du Tao

23:46.480 --> 23:48.030
This might just be the tip of the iceberg

23:48.960 --> 23:49.510
but we

23:49.680 --> 23:50.640
Toward a breakthrough

23:51.400 --> 23:53.070
Let's dig into the entire internet of spies

23:54.030 --> 23:55.680
Gao Tianyang got permission from his superiors.

23:55.750 --> 23:56.750
This dedicated team

23:56.750 --> 23:57.640
Deputy head

23:59.240 --> 24:00.640
Wuxi cooperates with your work

24:00.960 --> 24:02.030
Have you collaborated before?

24:03.000 --> 24:03.590
we cooperated

24:06.310 --> 24:06.920
wave

24:08.200 --> 24:08.880
computer expert

24:10.270 --> 24:11.720
I am also a game master

24:12.310 --> 24:13.750
for all of us

24:13.750 --> 24:15.350
provide technical support

24:16.790 --> 24:17.790
One day you can cooperate

24:17.880 --> 24:18.310
Yes

24:18.830 --> 24:19.480
let us do our best

24:20.000 --> 24:21.680
Hello, my account is Seokdu.

24:22.030 --> 24:23.200
Then everyone called me Seokdu.

24:24.920 --> 24:25.590
Director Jin Eye Clinic

24:25.790 --> 24:26.510
Memory card contents

24:26.550 --> 24:27.350
I solved the secret

24:28.750 --> 24:29.590
this

24:29.680 --> 24:30.680
I think this is experimental data.

24:32.880 --> 24:33.440
stop

24:35.000 --> 24:36.310
Analyze information as quickly as possible

24:37.030 --> 24:38.110
Find sources of experimental data

24:39.750 --> 24:40.400
How long does it take?

24:42.110 --> 24:42.920
please send me the data

24:43.350 --> 24:44.480
I'll be done in about an hour.

24:59.440 --> 25:00.960
After hearing the news from Chairman Zhang,

25:01.310 --> 25:02.070
In Zhenhai

25:02.070 --> 25:02.880
The player responsible for transportation

25:03.070 --> 25:04.070
i lost contact

25:04.680 --> 25:05.550
Fortunately

25:05.550 --> 25:07.000
Because I haven’t contacted anyone offline

25:07.830 --> 25:08.960
Already opened a game account

25:08.960 --> 25:09.590
I canceled

25:11.880 --> 25:12.750
If you lose a regular player

25:12.750 --> 25:13.440
not give a damn about

25:14.350 --> 25:16.270
Protecting our samples is of utmost importance.

25:17.590 --> 25:18.590
Please tell Chairman Zhang.

25:18.880 --> 25:19.640
don't wait any longer

25:20.310 --> 25:21.510
Steal samples now

25:23.030 --> 25:23.680
Boss Zhang

25:23.680 --> 25:25.160
I told the professor to get the sample.

25:25.880 --> 25:27.270
The result will be out soon

25:29.480 --> 25:30.070
that's right

25:30.880 --> 25:32.030
Zhenhai District Map

25:32.160 --> 25:33.200
You say there aren't enough transport vehicles.

25:48.200 --> 25:49.110
I can move this guy.

25:58.440 --> 25:59.310
He is from Zhenhai District

25:59.750 --> 26:00.920
This is a key development goal.

26:02.510 --> 26:03.750
Next Ace Special Attack

26:05.750 --> 26:06.590

26:19.440 --> 26:20.240
verification failed

26:22.400 --> 26:23.400

26:23.640 --> 26:24.640

26:26.960 --> 26:27.960

26:28.640 --> 26:29.110
I

26:29.400 --> 26:30.240
I will go

26:31.550 --> 26:32.070
open the door

26:34.070 --> 26:35.480
I really want to go

27:14.480 --> 27:14.880
Come in

27:35.000 --> 27:35.680

27:44.590 --> 27:46.160
Offline in offline tasks

27:47.790 --> 27:48.510
Boss Zhang

27:57.110 --> 27:58.480
So are you a real person?

27:58.680 --> 27:59.680
Or is it a game character?

28:00.720 --> 28:02.110
As you get deeper into the game

28:02.510 --> 28:03.400
my identity

28:03.920 --> 28:05.200
I will reveal it slowly

28:07.920 --> 28:08.680
What do you mean?

28:11.000 --> 28:11.750
your mission

28:12.240 --> 28:12.640
whenever

28:12.640 --> 28:13.960
I will send it to the application

28:14.400 --> 28:15.240
Be careful with your collection

28:17.070 --> 28:17.790
and

28:18.830 --> 28:20.750
When performing offline tasks

28:21.720 --> 28:22.920
you will have a partner

28:23.920 --> 28:25.160
i have a partner

28:26.240 --> 28:27.270
men and women?

28:27.680 --> 28:28.960
Isn't this Jiang Suhua?

28:30.960 --> 28:32.550
You will find out then

28:36.000 --> 28:36.720
I am

28:36.960 --> 28:39.110
I like James Band

28:39.480 --> 28:41.110
I don't really like Pollock House.

28:43.160 --> 28:44.750
What you need is Bang Yeorang

28:45.350 --> 28:46.480
Not reincarnation

28:47.720 --> 28:48.350

29:45.350 --> 29:46.030
Hello

29:46.790 --> 29:47.720

29:48.830 --> 29:50.790
Why? I would like to know?

29:51.310 --> 29:53.830
Don't hesitate and speak quickly

29:54.310 --> 29:55.830
Choose a lucky player in this game who is

29:56.030 --> 29:57.400
What is the mechanism?

29:57.680 --> 29:59.270
My level is higher than yours

29:59.440 --> 30:00.480
Why don't you choose me?

30:01.960 --> 30:02.640
to yourself

30:02.720 --> 30:03.640
Is there any misunderstanding?

30:04.790 --> 30:06.750
Get lost, don't make fun of me

30:07.350 --> 30:08.590
Have you tried offline missions?

30:08.960 --> 30:10.590
how could I know

30:11.480 --> 30:13.110
This version is in the game

30:13.310 --> 30:14.350
The most mysterious existence

30:14.590 --> 30:15.440
And you

30:15.640 --> 30:16.550
From a gamer I know

30:16.880 --> 30:18.400
The first person to receive an invitation

30:19.510 --> 30:21.400
Anyway, no matter what you play

30:21.830 --> 30:23.510
will be very exciting

30:24.790 --> 30:26.920
between us

30:27.200 --> 30:28.270
follow me

30:28.590 --> 30:29.830
What are we doing?

then we

30:31.000 --> 30:31.960
in a team

30:32.270 --> 30:33.830
While experiencing hardship and sadness together

30:34.070 --> 30:35.590
Play game together

30:35.830 --> 30:36.750
let's retire together

30:37.160 --> 30:38.790
Am I in your heart?

30:39.000 --> 30:39.720
Offline tasks

30:39.750 --> 30:40.510
I'm not qualified

30:41.110 --> 30:41.790
it's not worth it

30:42.240 --> 30:42.750
leave

30:43.200 --> 30:43.590
Hey

30:43.590 --> 30:45.110
You don't have a garden, do you?

30:45.480 --> 30:46.000
if i play together

30:46.070 --> 30:47.000
If you don't take me with you in the future

30:47.070 --> 30:47.960
You are suffering huge losses.

30:48.830 --> 30:49.350
Don't worry

30:49.480 --> 30:50.110
100,000 bonus

30:50.110 --> 30:51.310
You won't miss a penny

30:52.480 --> 30:52.960
and

30:53.070 --> 30:53.720
what else?

30:54.240 --> 30:55.270
I think I have another partner.

30:55.510 --> 30:56.070
men and women?

30:56.160 --> 30:57.070
Do you have a photo?

30:57.510 --> 30:58.480
I haven't seen it yet

30:58.640 --> 30:59.510
I'll tell you after seeing the pictures.

30:59.640 --> 31:00.160
I'll hang up the phone

31:06.000 --> 31:06.550
rainy day sister

31:07.160 --> 31:08.030
I found the source

31:09.030 --> 31:09.960
soon?

31:12.240 --> 31:13.160
Only 40 minutes have passed

31:13.590 --> 31:14.480
So did I pass?

31:18.590 --> 31:19.200
merchandise

31:21.200 --> 31:22.200
I baked it myself

31:22.790 --> 31:23.880
How do you know I'm hungry?

31:27.680 --> 31:28.440
Very tasty

31:28.510 --> 31:29.000
Yes or no?

31:31.880 --> 31:32.720
I have something to ask

31:33.200 --> 31:33.550
explain

31:35.200 --> 31:36.350
according to your opinion

31:36.550 --> 31:38.440
Between my sister-in-law and Director Gao

31:38.590 --> 31:39.790
we get along very well

31:40.400 --> 31:41.440
I can recognize it

31:44.240 --> 31:45.160
I don't think this is normal

31:46.350 --> 31:48.680
Eat snacks and work hard

31:48.720 --> 31:50.070
Stop talking nonsense.

31:56.480 --> 31:57.510
It is understood

31:57.720 --> 31:58.550
Dootao memory card

31:58.790 --> 32:00.070
This is some biological research material.

32:00.270 --> 32:00.920
No. B13

32:01.350 --> 32:01.960
B13

32:02.350 --> 32:03.110
as you know

32:04.640 --> 32:05.550
Zhenhai Institute of Biology

32:05.750 --> 32:06.440
B13 project

32:06.640 --> 32:07.270
in special attack game

32:07.480 --> 32:08.200
This is a popular item.

32:08.750 --> 32:09.510
A lot of people

32:09.720 --> 32:10.640
I'm looking for information

32:11.000 --> 32:11.720
information price

32:11.720 --> 32:12.680
Very highly recommended

32:13.240 --> 32:13.510
No

32:13.510 --> 32:14.830
In this special attack game

32:14.920 --> 32:16.310
Is there a black market for information trading?

32:16.640 --> 32:17.030
certainly

32:17.200 --> 32:18.590
This game was originally

32:18.640 --> 32:19.750
This is a virtual world of special forces.

32:20.000 --> 32:20.830
via virtual currency

32:21.030 --> 32:22.550
You can trade information within the following ranges

32:24.110 --> 32:25.240
Zhenhai Institute of Biology

32:25.240 --> 32:26.880
Founded by Zhenhai Group

32:26.880 --> 32:27.960
It is a scientific research organization.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
Belong to biological group

32:29.240 --> 32:30.640
It is a national key confidentiality department.

32:30.920 --> 32:32.000
So this professor

32:32.350 --> 32:33.160
perhaps

32:33.200 --> 32:34.590
We can hide it in this lab.

32:35.680 --> 32:37.030
Contact Biological Research Center today.

32:37.350 --> 32:38.880
Learn about B13

32:39.310 --> 32:40.350
Quickly find the source of leaks

32:40.550 --> 32:42.400
To avoid causing greater losses

32:42.510 --> 32:43.680
Yes, I will deal with it immediately.

32:43.720 --> 32:44.440
Wait a moment

32:45.590 --> 32:47.880
This investigation must be conducted in secret

32:48.590 --> 32:49.310
informant

32:49.310 --> 32:50.640
Keep it to a minimum

32:51.830 --> 32:52.590
at your home

32:52.590 --> 32:53.640
Your relatives were also there, right?

32:53.920 --> 32:55.590
Yes, my uncle Huang Jiaming.

32:56.350 --> 32:58.030
He is the director of the institute

32:58.400 --> 32:59.830
I am the deputy leader of the biology team.

33:00.400 --> 33:01.160
Do you believe?

33:01.550 --> 33:02.200
no way

33:03.400 --> 33:04.720
Let’s first understand the situation.

33:05.240 --> 33:05.790
ASAP

33:06.350 --> 33:07.000
Yes Yes

33:37.000 --> 33:38.550
well

33:41.510 --> 33:42.590
OK

33:45.640 --> 33:47.750
well

33:58.680 --> 34:00.400
well

34:00.750 --> 34:01.440
tie

34:14.070 --> 34:14.710
Huang Daju

34:16.710 --> 34:17.230
Anna

34:23.190 --> 34:24.630
Can't you make the name a little more fake?

34:25.400 --> 34:26.880
This name is a bit cheesy

34:28.070 --> 34:29.510
If it's tacky, it's fashionable.

34:32.360 --> 34:33.110
Which stage is this?

34:33.920 --> 34:35.000
Level 28 old knight

34:35.670 --> 34:36.440
I'll take you with me

34:37.480 --> 34:38.920
I am in grade 38 this year

34:41.190 --> 34:42.360
This sister’s study pressure

34:42.360 --> 34:43.550
not enough

34:45.320 --> 34:46.280
I am also 38 years old.

34:46.670 --> 34:47.670
You have to call me sister

34:48.320 --> 34:50.110
18 I can’t stay anymore

34:51.590 --> 34:52.630
don't underestimate me

34:53.030 --> 34:53.800
after

34:53.920 --> 34:55.230
If you get a bonus of 100,000

34:55.630 --> 34:56.840
all because of me

34:58.150 --> 34:59.630
Have you tried offline missions before?

34:59.960 --> 35:01.710
No, this is my first time

35:02.150 --> 35:03.150
So why blow it?

35:03.960 --> 35:04.670
see this situation

35:04.880 --> 35:05.710
We all play offline

35:06.030 --> 35:07.360
I flew away before I knew it

35:08.110 --> 35:08.920
Okay everyone

35:08.920 --> 35:09.960
Our commendation meeting is

35:10.000 --> 35:10.960
will start soon

35:11.000 --> 35:11.670
Our game is

35:11.670 --> 35:12.840
male and female partners

35:12.920 --> 35:13.880
The two-person system will be hybrid.

35:14.150 --> 35:15.360
victory is

35:15.550 --> 35:17.000
You will receive a model of the out-of-print ticket.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.960
The prize is 5,000 yuan.

35:21.150 --> 35:22.630
Join now

35:24.440 --> 35:25.760
The password prompted by the gateway is

35:26.360 --> 35:27.320
it's in the product

35:29.000 --> 35:30.030
So let's get started

35:33.510 --> 35:35.000
Our cows definitely have B13 in them.

35:35.000 --> 35:35.760
This is a key project

35:36.280 --> 35:37.840
The level of secrecy is very high.

35:39.480 --> 35:40.440
this material

35:41.000 --> 35:42.840
This is the experiment report

35:43.710 --> 35:46.670
I definitely think someone spilled the beans.

35:48.030 --> 35:49.110
Experimental research results

35:49.110 --> 35:49.840
I'm here?

35:51.280 --> 35:52.000
tomorrow

35:52.190 --> 35:53.800
Conduct final sample testing

35:54.400 --> 35:55.960
If there is no problem

35:56.190 --> 35:57.110
The first stage of the experiment is

35:57.320 --> 35:58.110
it's over

36:00.760 --> 36:01.630
In the laboratory

36:01.670 --> 36:02.550
Can I check it?

36:05.440 --> 36:06.110
if

36:06.960 --> 36:08.070
people in our lab

36:08.110 --> 36:09.070
It was leaked.

36:14.960 --> 36:16.110
Safety is most important

36:16.670 --> 36:18.320
I will be there in person tomorrow

36:18.320 --> 36:19.190
I gonna go see

36:21.150 --> 36:21.960
thank you uncle

36:23.840 --> 36:25.110
Even the old man didn't come back

36:25.510 --> 36:26.920
When you come back you make me feel so bad

36:27.510 --> 36:28.630
You should drink with me.

36:28.710 --> 36:29.510
or tonight

36:29.510 --> 36:30.480
I can not sleep

36:30.800 --> 36:31.230
OK

36:35.190 --> 36:36.280
What about the child?

36:36.480 --> 36:37.110
What are you doing?

36:38.760 --> 36:39.960
It's been a while for me too

36:42.070 --> 36:43.670
I'm old too

36:43.760 --> 36:44.920
I'm addicted to games

36:46.030 --> 36:47.150
He is such an old player

36:47.400 --> 36:48.920
What can you achieve?

36:52.670 --> 36:53.110
a good job

36:53.480 --> 36:53.880
I will do it

36:55.400 --> 36:56.230
Can you do it?

36:57.000 --> 36:57.960
What's your lucky number?

36:59.710 --> 37:00.320
11

37:01.590 --> 37:02.070
Yes

37:02.070 --> 37:03.480
There are 5 red gangs left.

37:03.480 --> 37:04.230
let's see

37:04.230 --> 37:05.630
Let's see what the first goal looks like.

37:06.480 --> 37:08.320
Pretty 20

37:11.000 --> 37:12.800
Quite 19 points

37:12.920 --> 37:14.110
Only 11 points left

37:14.280 --> 37:15.880
Hongbang can win

37:22.880 --> 37:23.510
Why?

37:24.280 --> 37:25.590
so sad

37:31.710 --> 37:32.670
Now

37:32.670 --> 37:34.190
Nambang players have 40 points left.

37:34.550 --> 37:35.030
let's see

37:35.030 --> 37:36.480
about what?

37:42.710 --> 37:43.670
great

37:43.670 --> 37:45.150
This is a 20 point double area.

37:47.400 --> 37:48.150
from the blue side

37:48.360 --> 37:49.880
I won

37:50.110 --> 37:50.710
great

37:50.840 --> 37:52.070
ruler

37:52.070 --> 37:53.230
Out-of-print standard model

37:53.230 --> 37:54.320
There is also 5,000 won in cash.

37:54.480 --> 37:55.070
So is that so?

37:55.670 --> 37:56.960
It's definitely fashionable.

37:57.070 --> 37:58.070
I haven't even started the game yet

37:58.110 --> 37:59.150
It has ended

38:02.590 --> 38:03.320
What are you doing?

38:03.920 --> 38:05.510
No, look at mine.

38:11.630 --> 38:12.110
Hello

38:12.360 --> 38:13.510
Please give me an iced Coke.

38:13.510 --> 38:13.880
Thanks

38:13.880 --> 38:14.190
Yes

38:23.000 --> 38:23.840
How did you get it?

38:27.480 --> 38:28.230
What should I say?

38:29.070 --> 38:29.630
attraction

38:32.070 --> 38:33.760
I changed it to 1,000 yuan.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.480
The wealth is staggering.

38:40.230 --> 38:41.030
I didn't even get the bonus

38:41.190 --> 38:41.840
pick it up first

38:41.880 --> 38:42.920
If you enter 1,000 yuan

38:44.590 --> 38:46.070
If I could go on a mission with you

38:46.230 --> 38:48.150
If I make friends, I've earned it.

38:48.550 --> 38:49.400
friend

38:50.110 --> 38:51.030
once in here

38:51.070 --> 38:52.320
any clues

39:08.070 --> 39:08.630
if you stab me like this

39:17.030 --> 39:19.000
135790

39:20.190 --> 39:21.070
I think this is the password

39:23.480 --> 39:25.190
Please save your password

39:28.150 --> 39:28.760
Yes?

39:30.280 --> 39:31.400
thermos cup

39:38.880 --> 39:39.440
sit here

40:01.190 --> 40:02.110
i already told you

40:02.280 --> 40:03.110
this

40:03.110 --> 40:04.000
It can't be an ordinary thermos cup.

40:05.630 --> 40:06.400
on this brush

40:06.440 --> 40:07.280
what is in here

40:09.670 --> 40:10.920
you can put anything in it

40:11.920 --> 40:12.960
Wait for task prompts

40:16.000 --> 40:16.550
OK

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
Then I'll leave the tools to you first.

40:18.320 --> 40:18.920
I go first

40:20.960 --> 40:22.070
Why not leave your contact information?

40:22.800 --> 40:24.000
You can find me in the game

40:24.630 --> 40:25.550
Even outside the game

40:25.550 --> 40:26.320
call

40:28.280 --> 40:29.110
This is about making friends.

40:29.670 --> 40:30.760
I'm used to taking my time

40:32.400 --> 40:33.800
See you tomorrow, friends.

40:40.880 --> 40:41.360
Boss Huang

40:42.400 --> 40:43.000
let me ask you

40:43.320 --> 40:44.710
B13 What is the specific research?

40:45.400 --> 40:46.150
this

40:46.550 --> 40:47.760
In the field of biological genes

40:47.760 --> 40:48.710
The research project is

40:49.440 --> 40:51.630
Targeting OC43 virus

40:51.710 --> 40:52.760
Serum antibodies

40:53.150 --> 40:54.230
Asian genes

40:54.480 --> 40:56.840
Lack of antibodies against these viruses

40:57.280 --> 40:58.440
B13 serum antibodies

40:58.550 --> 40:59.760
If you pass clinical

40:59.920 --> 41:02.320
We will fill this gap generation after generation.

41:02.800 --> 41:03.920
The result of this study is

41:04.190 --> 41:05.960
Currently around the world

41:06.320 --> 41:07.590
This is the most advanced

41:08.630 --> 41:10.400
The most important results of the B13 project are

41:10.840 --> 41:13.280
I have a serum sample for antibodies.

41:13.510 --> 41:14.280
I have already informed

41:14.320 --> 41:15.280
secret director

41:15.550 --> 41:16.440
I will cooperate

41:17.360 --> 41:18.960
Serum samples for B13 were

41:19.320 --> 41:21.510
There are very limited people you can contact.

41:22.280 --> 41:22.880
almost

41:23.070 --> 41:24.630
Only those who participated in the experiment

41:25.150 --> 41:26.840
Who is eligible to take samples?

41:27.070 --> 41:28.510
with project manager

41:28.630 --> 41:30.440
Only some researchers take the lead

41:49.670 --> 41:50.480
The result is out

41:59.710 --> 42:00.150
It doesn't matter

42:00.400 --> 42:00.960
sample

42:01.320 --> 42:02.230
frozen cosmetics

42:02.320 --> 42:02.840
Yes
