01:49.229 --> 01:49.680
how?

01:50.710 --> 01:51.400
What and how?

01:54.070 --> 01:54.870
Huang Zisheng.

01:57.430 --> 01:58.400
We had a great time chatting.

02:00.310 --> 02:01.150
I realized

02:01.560 --> 02:02.590
he is

02:02.960 --> 02:04.520
Very cheerful person.

02:06.310 --> 02:07.150
why do we use

02:07.310 --> 02:08.910
A cheerful person?

02:10.470 --> 02:11.150
Ask the spy.

02:11.150 --> 02:11.960
They choose it.

02:16.240 --> 02:17.000
if your attitude

02:17.150 --> 02:18.360
to others,

02:18.960 --> 02:19.430
no need

02:19.430 --> 02:20.870
Me becoming a lobbyist?

02:22.560 --> 02:23.310
Have you reminded him?

02:24.520 --> 02:25.240
Let’s wait and see.

02:36.150 --> 02:37.030
tonight,

02:37.470 --> 02:38.470
Not eating yet?

02:40.710 --> 02:41.710
I also have a bowl of instant noodles.

02:41.910 --> 02:42.400
I'll get it for you.

02:42.590 --> 02:44.800
Your emotional intelligence is very high.

02:46.560 --> 02:47.470
i will entertain you

02:48.030 --> 02:49.000
Gram.

02:49.430 --> 02:50.590
Then I'll eat instant noodles.

02:52.430 --> 02:53.360
Han Lie came in.

03:36.800 --> 03:37.360
Han Lie has accepted it.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.360
New mission letter.

03:40.310 --> 03:40.590
This seems to be

03:40.590 --> 03:41.710
He'll be making new moves soon.

03:48.120 --> 03:48.800
After accepting the mission,

03:48.960 --> 03:49.960
Han Lie immediately ordered

03:50.120 --> 03:50.870
hotel room.

03:51.280 --> 03:52.310
Resort Pulau Xiaoyue.

03:52.470 --> 03:53.079
Tomorrow evening.

03:53.310 --> 03:54.190
registered resident

03:54.310 --> 03:54.870
He was alone.

04:14.430 --> 04:15.120
The elevator has arrived.

04:15.360 --> 04:15.830
Thanks.

05:05.190 --> 05:05.830
why don't you take it

05:06.000 --> 05:06.950
CCTV Hotel?

05:07.480 --> 05:08.750
The identity of the contact is not yet known.

05:09.070 --> 05:10.430
If he hides in a hotel

05:10.560 --> 05:11.480
There is a risk of being discovered.

05:12.750 --> 05:13.120
Why?

05:13.190 --> 05:14.800
They have to come to the hotel to pick up the goods,

05:14.870 --> 05:16.070
Still have to stay one night.

05:16.870 --> 05:17.480
have no idea.

05:44.070 --> 05:45.120
He is very relaxed.

05:51.159 --> 05:51.830
then,

05:52.070 --> 05:52.950
When is your vacation?

05:57.040 --> 05:57.920
You should know.

06:00.480 --> 06:01.240
After we broke up,

06:01.240 --> 06:02.480
Don’t you go on vacation anymore?

06:03.190 --> 06:04.240
impossible.

06:04.950 --> 06:06.480
This is not a holiday.

06:08.830 --> 06:09.720
in this case,

06:09.870 --> 06:11.000
No longer looking for a girlfriend?

06:12.830 --> 06:13.270
Tanya.

06:13.950 --> 06:14.830
just asking.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.190
Liu, he's back.

07:00.750 --> 07:01.240
as a child,

07:01.270 --> 07:02.240
My home is near here.

07:03.870 --> 07:05.680
My sister often takes me here.

07:17.190 --> 07:18.000
I'm the one causing this problem.

07:19.240 --> 07:19.870
Where is your sister?

07:21.600 --> 07:23.750
My brother can do whatever he wants

07:24.070 --> 07:25.430
Do better than me.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.750
Only the person who truly loves you

07:29.950 --> 07:30.510
who will continue to give to you

07:30.720 --> 07:31.510
Chances of screwing up.

07:34.270 --> 07:34.830
perhaps.

07:38.270 --> 07:39.310
you

07:40.240 --> 07:41.159
tell your sister

07:41.159 --> 07:42.159
About the game?

07:43.270 --> 07:43.950
impossible.

07:44.310 --> 07:45.310
This is our secret.

07:45.920 --> 07:47.159
What should I tell him?

07:48.800 --> 07:50.240
He thought I would only bring trouble.

07:51.360 --> 07:52.159
recently,

07:52.240 --> 07:53.159
This happens.

07:54.270 --> 07:55.310
Maybe he's right.

08:03.360 --> 08:04.310
I don't find it funny either.

08:07.310 --> 08:08.950
Just for fun, don't understand the specific situation.

08:09.160 --> 08:09.630
Isn't it visible?

08:09.680 --> 08:10.680
Too hypocritical?

08:13.920 --> 08:15.160
exit the game.

08:16.680 --> 08:17.870
Are you really not worried at all?

08:18.270 --> 08:18.830
Worry.

08:19.870 --> 08:21.120
But we can’t sink deeper and deeper.

08:22.630 --> 08:23.160
but my heart

08:23.240 --> 08:24.430
Still a little uneasy.

08:25.560 --> 08:26.360
Feeling guilty?

08:26.670 --> 08:27.790
Can you use nice words?

08:28.120 --> 08:29.240
and lost?

08:30.030 --> 08:31.150
We are the victims.

08:31.550 --> 08:32.480
We are stuck.

08:32.909 --> 08:33.840
Two young people tested negative.

08:34.030 --> 08:35.600
Consoling yourself after making a mistake?

08:38.789 --> 08:39.960
ways to entertain yourself

08:40.120 --> 08:41.120
Won't come to the beach.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.440
sigh.

08:43.320 --> 08:44.120
I can't stand it either

08:44.150 --> 08:45.240
Feeling sorry for myself here.

08:45.510 --> 08:46.320
Tomorrow is the weekend,

08:47.150 --> 08:48.080
Do you still dare to go crazy?

08:50.870 --> 08:51.360
What are you doing?

08:53.320 --> 08:54.390
Across oceans.

08:56.750 --> 08:57.320
Ayo.

09:31.510 --> 09:32.960
Why doesn't he go to the elevator?

09:34.480 --> 09:35.390
Where did he go?

09:36.600 --> 09:37.670
The safe path is on the other side.

09:38.360 --> 09:38.790
Batu.

09:39.910 --> 09:40.360
Ada.

09:40.550 --> 09:41.360
decided.

10:07.840 --> 10:08.480
This is a safety line

10:08.600 --> 10:09.550
Towards the roof.

10:10.870 --> 10:11.550
you check

10:12.150 --> 10:12.790
Is there anyone else?

10:12.790 --> 10:13.360
To the roof?

10:13.790 --> 10:14.150
OK

10:52.510 --> 10:53.080
It's all over.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.150
No one goes to the roof.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.630
No receipts, no transactions.

10:58.790 --> 11:00.080
So what can we do on the roof?

11:03.750 --> 11:04.360
roof?

11:06.000 --> 11:06.870
military base.

11:10.390 --> 11:11.120
Hang Lie is back.

11:21.960 --> 11:23.480
Come on, go up and have a look.

12:02.110 --> 12:03.320
Do you think this signal tower

12:03.790 --> 12:04.720
Is there anything special?

12:06.440 --> 12:07.750
Opposite is the military headquarters.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.030
There is a host.

13:28.550 --> 13:29.390
There is a hard drive here.

13:30.870 --> 13:32.480
There is a hard drive.

13:33.960 --> 13:35.240
Be sure to have a camera.

13:43.870 --> 13:44.480
The camera is here.

13:44.550 --> 13:45.510
Extraordinary.

13:52.750 --> 13:53.550
There's a military base lurking here.

13:53.720 --> 13:54.670
is the best view.

13:56.790 --> 13:58.150
This signal tower is built here.

13:59.080 --> 14:00.000
There must be something wrong.

14:01.480 --> 14:02.390
Han Lie stood up again.

14:17.390 --> 14:17.840
Ayo.

16:28.790 --> 16:29.240
Ayo.

16:51.750 --> 16:52.600
feels like my life

16:52.600 --> 16:54.120
A new chapter will begin.

16:58.240 --> 16:59.240
what are you kissing

17:00.830 --> 17:01.920
don't you think

17:02.070 --> 17:03.200
full

17:03.240 --> 17:04.200
About to run

17:04.240 --> 17:05.480
Feel the peak of life?

17:06.400 --> 17:08.240
Young people like to fantasize, and that's a good thing.

17:11.109 --> 17:11.960
This is where?

17:29.790 --> 17:30.310
Play with this.

17:31.270 --> 17:31.750
Yes.

17:32.720 --> 17:33.310
how?

17:36.640 --> 17:38.030
Do you dare to play big?

17:38.960 --> 17:39.480
How old?

17:40.550 --> 17:41.790
In one round, everything is at stake.

17:43.110 --> 17:43.590
stop.

17:44.400 --> 17:44.830
Don't dare.

17:46.550 --> 17:47.350
Why not?

17:47.510 --> 17:47.920
Ayo.

17:50.480 --> 17:51.550
You think, this round

17:51.790 --> 17:53.030
Do we win or lose?

17:55.400 --> 17:55.920
I won.

17:56.880 --> 17:57.440
I bet I lost.

17:58.240 --> 17:59.240
Who lost the bet?

17:59.350 --> 18:00.240
Very unfortunate.

18:00.920 --> 18:02.960
I won the bet, and I also won the other party.

18:06.070 --> 18:06.480
OK

18:07.550 --> 18:08.960
If you can really win

18:09.880 --> 18:10.880
Let me tell you a secret.

18:11.550 --> 18:12.510
if i win,

18:12.960 --> 18:14.000
I also have to tell you a secret.

18:14.510 --> 18:15.030
agree.

18:15.550 --> 18:16.160
agree.

18:19.680 --> 18:20.400
What's the stakes?

18:23.070 --> 18:23.590
I can bet.

18:24.240 --> 18:24.680
strong.

18:26.070 --> 18:26.550
it's your turn.

18:26.790 --> 18:27.400
I also gamble at the bank.

18:28.480 --> 18:29.680
How can we make the same bet?

18:29.830 --> 18:31.160
If you want to keep it, you have to keep one too.

18:31.510 --> 18:32.270
You're stupid, aren't you?

18:32.270 --> 18:33.550
Where are the contrarian bets?

18:33.960 --> 18:34.590
besides,

18:35.070 --> 18:35.920
We must win together.

18:36.160 --> 18:36.920
If you lose, lose together.

18:38.480 --> 18:39.350
It seems I can't

18:39.400 --> 18:40.550
Can't leave you.

18:41.790 --> 18:42.310
Open the card.

18:42.720 --> 18:44.310
Relax a little, Zhuang.

18:45.960 --> 18:47.350
The villagers are not small.

18:48.440 --> 18:49.510
It seems we are both very lucky

18:49.680 --> 18:50.680
Turning over is very difficult.

18:53.400 --> 18:54.240
This is fate.

18:55.200 --> 18:55.590
Ayo.

18:56.240 --> 18:56.640
Ayo.

19:07.590 --> 19:08.110
It's all over.

19:22.790 --> 19:24.790
Duane Resort hides this.

19:25.200 --> 19:25.790
camera.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.310
He monitors the whole process

19:27.350 --> 19:28.030
Military headquarters.

19:29.000 --> 19:29.510
Now,

19:29.550 --> 19:30.640
We solve two problems.

19:31.310 --> 19:31.680
First,

19:32.200 --> 19:32.830
how do we prevent

19:33.000 --> 19:34.160
Was this video leaked?

19:34.920 --> 19:35.830
Want to touch Han Lie?

19:36.590 --> 19:37.000
second.

19:37.590 --> 19:39.000
Find this camera.

19:39.310 --> 19:40.400
Has Hangul been installed?

19:40.590 --> 19:41.160
or

19:41.750 --> 19:42.830
other people?

19:43.440 --> 19:44.720
I think whoever installed the camera

19:44.830 --> 19:45.720
Not necessarily Han Lie.

19:46.550 --> 19:47.750
Through our previous investigation,

19:47.960 --> 19:48.920
he just

19:49.030 --> 19:50.070
Who sends the message.

19:52.750 --> 19:53.400
This research

19:53.550 --> 19:54.350
maybe not

19:54.510 --> 19:55.270
within a short period of time.

19:56.350 --> 19:57.880
Okay, turn it back first.

19:58.440 --> 19:59.510
Let’s solve Han Lie’s problem first.

20:00.200 --> 20:00.550
OK

20:02.110 --> 20:03.590
Hangyeol’s report notes show

20:03.790 --> 20:05.270
A batch of fresh food will be delivered in the afternoon.

20:06.030 --> 20:07.160
Video images maybe

20:07.440 --> 20:08.790
will be hidden inside and sent out.

20:09.830 --> 20:11.350
In order to prevent the secret video from being spread,

20:11.550 --> 20:12.400
we must stop

20:12.550 --> 20:13.480
Delivery of the Item.

20:14.440 --> 20:15.270
but...

20:15.590 --> 20:16.200
this traffic route

20:16.200 --> 20:17.270
We have been paying attention for so long

20:17.790 --> 20:18.440
Grab it.

20:18.480 --> 20:19.160
A little reluctantly.

20:20.880 --> 20:22.110
Can you do it?

20:22.550 --> 20:23.030
so,

20:23.030 --> 20:24.400
we take advantage of this opportunity

20:25.160 --> 20:25.830
melalui Hangyeol.

20:26.000 --> 20:26.510
we force it

20:26.510 --> 20:27.550
Boss Zhang is right behind him.

20:30.440 --> 20:31.310
If this video

20:31.480 --> 20:33.200
Unable to send

20:33.240 --> 20:33.920
from sea routes.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.750
Boss Zhang will definitely consider it

20:35.750 --> 20:36.680
Other methods.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.240
Submit this video.

20:39.000 --> 20:39.550
so,

20:39.830 --> 20:41.240
We can catch more fish.

20:41.960 --> 20:42.350
OK

20:43.350 --> 20:44.680
I called customs right away.

20:45.590 --> 20:46.920
Prevent Han Lie from going to sea.

21:33.030 --> 21:34.310
The system displays this item

21:34.400 --> 21:35.400
not approved.

21:36.920 --> 21:37.960
But when I give it to me

21:38.000 --> 21:38.830
Already approved.

21:39.640 --> 21:39.960
sorry.

21:40.200 --> 21:40.830
we can only

21:40.920 --> 21:42.030
Based on system results.

21:42.720 --> 21:43.750
An inspection was recently conducted.

21:44.200 --> 21:44.830
This is your item

21:45.030 --> 21:45.640
already taken.

21:46.350 --> 21:47.550
We have to check everything.

21:48.070 --> 21:49.400
Send the cargo to the checkpoint.

21:52.200 --> 21:52.830
beautiful.

21:53.000 --> 21:53.960
OK, thanks.

22:26.880 --> 22:27.750
He started looking for help.

22:28.310 --> 22:29.510
Let’s see how Boss Zhang handles it.

22:43.240 --> 22:45.070
Han Jie didn’t send this thing.

22:48.440 --> 22:49.160
what happened?

22:50.750 --> 22:52.070
Customs inspection.

22:57.160 --> 22:57.880
What a coincidence.

23:02.550 --> 23:04.400
When we send the goods,

23:05.480 --> 23:06.550
I feel unusual.

23:09.720 --> 23:11.000
Do you think there are people from Guoan behind this?

23:13.750 --> 23:14.590
There is such a possibility.

23:16.270 --> 23:17.750
This line is very important to us.

23:20.350 --> 23:22.110
So, we have to leverage relationships.

23:23.880 --> 23:25.200
Find out what happened.

23:32.160 --> 23:32.550
Halo?

23:33.550 --> 23:34.880
Secretary Zheng, it’s me.

23:36.070 --> 23:36.550
what is it?

23:37.350 --> 23:37.960
That's it.

23:38.160 --> 23:38.920
have a friend

23:39.070 --> 23:39.880
Let me ask something.

23:40.270 --> 23:40.920
piece of cake?

23:41.110 --> 23:41.550
I think

23:41.880 --> 23:43.030
No need to bother the leader anymore.

23:43.510 --> 23:44.160
so,

23:44.310 --> 23:45.440
Ask him.

23:46.920 --> 23:47.400
explain.

23:48.550 --> 23:49.400
This friend of mine

23:49.680 --> 23:51.240
There are many goods that are subject to customs inspection.

23:51.750 --> 23:52.270
I want to ask,

23:52.310 --> 23:53.440
What is the specific reason?

23:55.240 --> 23:56.510
Send me the details.

23:56.880 --> 23:57.680
I will get back to you as soon as possible.

23:58.750 --> 24:00.160
Thanks.

24:21.000 --> 24:21.790
Actually what?

24:21.830 --> 24:22.790
what exactly is it?

24:25.030 --> 24:26.000
Have you never lost?

24:27.030 --> 24:28.270
If you lose, there are no secrets anymore.

24:29.510 --> 24:30.070
I'm thinking,

24:30.200 --> 24:31.110
if you tell me

24:31.160 --> 24:31.790
your secret,

24:31.880 --> 24:33.030
I'll tell you mine too.

24:36.030 --> 24:36.830
Because you really keep your promise,

24:36.920 --> 24:37.720
bet,

24:37.790 --> 24:38.400
Forget it.

24:38.590 --> 24:39.200
in this case,

24:39.550 --> 24:40.790
what you really want to say

24:41.350 --> 24:43.000
I would listen reluctantly.

24:44.160 --> 24:44.790
Forget it.

24:45.270 --> 24:46.110
Did not you say

24:46.110 --> 24:47.550
Is everything doomed?

24:48.000 --> 24:49.160
Because we lost the bet,

24:49.310 --> 24:50.310
maybe god

24:50.400 --> 24:51.510
make it impossible for us

24:51.510 --> 24:53.030
Sharing too many secrets with each other.

24:54.790 --> 24:55.350
correct.

24:56.310 --> 24:57.000
This is all fate.

24:58.550 --> 25:00.000
So, let's save it first

25:00.110 --> 25:01.160
The secret is in my heart.

25:06.590 --> 25:07.270
to be honest.

25:08.350 --> 25:09.240
are you sorry

25:09.400 --> 25:10.070
Want to play with me?

25:11.590 --> 25:12.880
if your partner is not me

25:13.830 --> 25:14.480
Neither will you

25:14.550 --> 25:15.790
related to this issue.

25:16.880 --> 25:17.350
regret.

25:21.110 --> 25:21.720
sorry.

25:21.750 --> 25:22.830
Why should I meet you?

25:22.960 --> 25:23.640
In the game?

25:24.110 --> 25:24.830
if

25:24.880 --> 25:26.400
Another way to meet,

25:27.310 --> 25:28.680
You won't be so unlucky now.

25:35.110 --> 25:36.270
Don't think too much.

25:36.920 --> 25:37.960
What went wrong was the game.

25:38.200 --> 25:39.200
Can't blame anyone.

25:40.720 --> 25:41.440
besides,

25:43.480 --> 25:44.640
Even without you,

25:45.550 --> 25:46.960
I can't escape either.

25:50.680 --> 25:51.160
this game

25:51.160 --> 25:52.310
It is unknown how many people were injured.

25:56.350 --> 25:57.070
As you said,

25:57.160 --> 25:58.640
Are we going back to play?

26:02.590 --> 26:03.480
What do you mean?

26:04.110 --> 26:04.640
Don’t we all agree?

26:04.720 --> 26:05.480
Quit the game together?

26:05.480 --> 26:06.270
what's on your mind?

26:09.550 --> 26:10.400
I feel like he's

26:10.400 --> 26:11.200
A nightmare.

26:11.350 --> 26:12.350
appears sometimes.

26:13.640 --> 26:15.240
I can't help but think about it.

26:16.030 --> 26:17.480
I always feel that this problem is definitely not solved.

26:19.750 --> 26:20.400
Who are you,

26:20.590 --> 26:21.480
So relaxing.

26:25.790 --> 26:26.680
Very relaxing.

26:28.400 --> 26:29.350
Not playing games.

26:29.830 --> 26:30.680
like

26:30.830 --> 26:31.960
There is no purpose.

26:32.480 --> 26:33.830
Life has become very boring.

26:38.440 --> 26:39.310
Do you know why?

26:41.030 --> 26:41.790
because of U.S

26:41.790 --> 26:42.750
In the game world.

26:43.030 --> 26:43.830
They are all gods.

26:44.550 --> 26:45.790
But in the real world,

26:46.240 --> 26:47.240
Instead, it does nothing.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.240
Been playing this game for a long time.

26:52.550 --> 26:53.440
Can't tell the difference anymore

26:53.590 --> 26:54.640
Virtual and reality.

26:55.590 --> 26:56.270
Have we been hit?

26:56.270 --> 26:57.270
Game poison?

27:02.350 --> 27:03.030
what we lost

27:03.070 --> 27:04.310
Not just a game,

27:05.160 --> 27:06.920
But escape to another world.

27:07.510 --> 27:08.720
Give up your chance.

27:11.400 --> 27:12.160
Look at them.

27:16.200 --> 27:17.310
They don't play.

27:17.720 --> 27:18.830
They are still alive.

27:20.590 --> 27:22.030
as long as you can accept it

27:22.030 --> 27:23.550
Boring life,

27:23.680 --> 27:24.440
enough.

27:27.030 --> 27:27.720
in this case...

27:27.960 --> 27:28.830
Not really.

27:31.270 --> 27:31.720
Incidentally,

27:32.200 --> 27:33.480
Do you have any other goals?

27:33.920 --> 27:34.790
or

27:35.590 --> 27:36.400
Or dream.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.200
There were a lot of people like that when I was a kid

27:42.400 --> 27:43.480
When you grow up, you no longer have it.

27:44.270 --> 27:45.400
my dream first

27:45.550 --> 27:46.270
Saving the world.

27:48.030 --> 27:48.720
so?

27:49.110 --> 27:49.880
I realize now that I

27:50.000 --> 27:50.960
Puzzled.

27:51.070 --> 27:52.400
More than 20 years later,

27:53.030 --> 27:54.790
Not only can I not save the world,

27:55.070 --> 27:55.790
I may still need

27:55.960 --> 27:57.240
Saved by this world.

28:01.110 --> 28:02.270
I feel the same way.

28:04.310 --> 28:05.720
I'm very depressed now

28:05.880 --> 28:08.110
You must use gambling to numb yourself.

28:08.960 --> 28:09.510
Use betting

28:09.640 --> 28:10.880
with bets.

28:14.030 --> 28:14.440
As you said,

28:14.480 --> 28:15.790
Do we want to live like this?

28:18.720 --> 28:19.400
so?

28:20.270 --> 28:21.510
Can you really become Superman?

28:22.400 --> 28:24.110
Superman is definitely not.

28:24.240 --> 28:25.200
But at least,

28:25.550 --> 28:26.240
we can still do it

28:26.350 --> 28:27.480
Something meaningful.

28:29.160 --> 28:29.640
For example?

28:30.480 --> 28:32.160
Just like now.

28:32.720 --> 28:33.640
You can do it first.

28:34.200 --> 28:35.640
And try not to cause trouble to the country.

28:44.790 --> 28:45.310
And you?

28:45.640 --> 28:46.750
What are your next plans?

28:50.240 --> 28:51.000
maybe one day

28:51.070 --> 28:52.070
I'm leaving Jinhai.

28:54.880 --> 28:55.550
where to?

28:57.200 --> 28:57.880
Back to Los Angeles.

28:59.270 --> 29:00.000
I didn't have any plans at first

29:00.160 --> 29:01.440
Stay in Jinhai.

29:03.070 --> 29:04.200
It turns out you are in Jinhai

29:05.440 --> 29:06.240
for

29:06.550 --> 29:07.350
mission accomplished.

29:08.310 --> 29:08.830
correct.

29:11.680 --> 29:12.790
In order to meet you,

29:14.440 --> 29:15.510
Play games with you.

29:17.640 --> 29:19.110
I know it's a lie

29:19.440 --> 29:20.590
But I'm glad to hear it.

29:21.830 --> 29:22.880
You drank too much.

29:23.920 --> 29:24.720
Not drunk.

29:28.440 --> 29:29.750
Have you ever heard a saying?

29:31.200 --> 29:32.550
The more I realize it, the more ridiculous I find it.

29:33.720 --> 29:34.640
I want

29:34.750 --> 29:36.270
Should I go back to racing?

29:38.790 --> 29:39.070
No.

29:39.070 --> 29:40.070
Didn’t you just ban me?

29:40.070 --> 29:40.510
Bring this up?

29:40.510 --> 29:41.480
Why do you say that yourself?

29:42.030 --> 29:43.640
They deceived me.

29:43.880 --> 29:44.640
I lost miserably.

29:44.680 --> 29:45.270
Where did I lose?

29:45.270 --> 29:46.200
Where should I win?

29:49.680 --> 29:50.720
You are really drunk.

29:51.240 --> 29:52.240
you lose

29:52.350 --> 29:53.110
At the casino.

29:53.160 --> 29:54.110
Not in the game.

29:54.750 --> 29:55.480
I don't mean money.

29:55.790 --> 29:56.400
so what?

29:57.440 --> 29:57.920
you.

30:05.830 --> 30:06.680
You are really drunk.

30:07.270 --> 30:07.790
cheers.

30:09.550 --> 30:10.750
You are really drunk.

30:11.550 --> 30:12.310
No.

30:44.200 --> 30:45.070
as far as I know,

30:45.790 --> 30:47.110
Customs receives report

30:47.920 --> 30:49.480
Your store is suspected of smuggling.

30:50.550 --> 30:51.200
smuggling?

30:52.510 --> 30:53.350
Who reported it?

30:54.750 --> 30:56.110
Have you ever offended anyone?

30:57.680 --> 30:58.510
No.

31:01.200 --> 31:03.200
Customs will be keeping a close eye on you these days.

31:03.830 --> 31:04.920
For security reasons,

31:05.550 --> 31:07.070
all tasks in this row

31:07.070 --> 31:08.030
Stop first.

31:09.270 --> 31:10.960
We'll decide later.

31:13.750 --> 31:14.680
Where is the cargo?

31:16.160 --> 31:17.510
I'll send someone to get it.

31:18.790 --> 31:20.110
and sent from another line.

31:21.790 --> 31:22.480
OK

31:48.200 --> 31:48.790
Hello, Director Huang.

31:48.880 --> 31:50.070
Hello Hello hello.

31:50.350 --> 31:51.510
Welcome to Macau.

31:51.640 --> 31:52.590
I'm also looking forward to it.

31:52.640 --> 31:53.590
this seminar.

31:53.590 --> 31:54.200
Very good, very good, very good.

31:54.480 --> 31:55.790
Please sit inside.

31:56.000 --> 31:56.400
OK

32:39.510 --> 32:40.350
Hang Lie leaves.

32:43.720 --> 32:44.720
He went to church again.

32:44.960 --> 32:45.750
Most likely he accepted

32:45.750 --> 32:46.440
New mission.

32:47.200 --> 32:48.550
Do you think he's going to hand it over?

32:49.160 --> 32:49.750
perhaps.

32:50.480 --> 32:51.270
Customs clearance cannot be carried out.

32:51.480 --> 32:52.750
He must choose another path.

32:53.790 --> 32:54.720
Hope it will show up this time

32:54.720 --> 32:55.440
It's Boss Zhang.

32:57.960 --> 32:58.440
Already arrived.

33:28.510 --> 33:29.110
Tuan Yu.

33:29.440 --> 33:30.790
The laboratory has sent it

33:30.960 --> 33:32.880
B13 ingredient analysis.

33:34.440 --> 33:35.830
The B13 sample we got

33:36.070 --> 33:37.790
and the form of this composition

33:38.070 --> 33:39.070
All the same.

33:39.440 --> 33:40.550
But there are still some

33:40.720 --> 33:41.590
Slightly different.

33:43.880 --> 33:44.830
The difference is very small.

33:45.000 --> 33:45.920
We suspect this sample

33:46.070 --> 33:46.920
problem appear

33:47.030 --> 33:47.920
there is a question.

33:48.480 --> 33:49.790
Or he's not

33:49.830 --> 33:51.270
Latest research results.

33:54.310 --> 33:55.070
OK, thanks.

34:13.070 --> 34:14.280
I received a sample of B13.

34:14.400 --> 34:15.000
there is a question.

34:16.230 --> 34:16.800
there is a question.

34:19.190 --> 34:20.320
Not a final sample.

34:23.150 --> 34:24.480
What do you think the problem is?

34:26.030 --> 34:27.230
The person who handles the sample,

34:27.960 --> 34:28.880
ada Yu Xiaoyue.

34:30.190 --> 34:30.840
Shi Lei.

34:31.510 --> 34:32.360
dan Han Jie.

34:34.190 --> 34:35.320
It can't be Yu Xiaoyue.

34:37.840 --> 34:39.190
He didn't get the original sample.

34:40.400 --> 34:41.510
There was no reason for him to commit suicide.

34:44.000 --> 34:44.920
Shi Leidan Han Jie

34:44.960 --> 34:45.670
Also a possibility

34:45.670 --> 34:47.230
Do something during transmission.

34:49.440 --> 34:50.800
Shi Lei has already gone out.

34:51.960 --> 34:53.440
Han Jie is one of his own.

34:56.960 --> 34:58.480
He had no reason to take samples.

34:58.760 --> 34:59.880
Then sit quietly.

35:04.150 --> 35:05.070
There is another possibility.

35:07.000 --> 35:07.920
you mean,

35:09.360 --> 35:10.800
What are the Gook-an people doing?

35:12.840 --> 35:13.960
This is the worst case scenario.

35:15.480 --> 35:16.760
if this is true

35:18.000 --> 35:19.440
Our transportation route is in Zhenhai

35:20.280 --> 35:20.840
most likely

35:20.840 --> 35:22.070
under their supervision.

35:23.960 --> 35:25.670
Han Lie's situation is very dangerous.

35:30.320 --> 35:31.030
National Security Agency.

35:31.670 --> 35:32.800
He may have been watched.

35:33.710 --> 35:34.510
You have to be careful.

35:36.920 --> 35:37.440
OK

35:51.630 --> 35:52.110
say.

35:53.150 --> 35:54.630
Han Lie was discovered.

35:55.630 --> 35:56.630
He knows too much.

35:57.150 --> 35:58.280
It cannot fall into the hands of Guoan.

35:59.760 --> 36:01.070
Find a way to save it.

36:02.480 --> 36:03.000
OK

37:01.070 --> 37:01.440
Halo?

37:02.110 --> 37:02.710
You're caught.

37:02.960 --> 37:04.000
Someone is coming to pick you up. Come on.

37:22.150 --> 37:22.630
Han Lie has already come down.

37:22.760 --> 37:23.550
That motorcycle.

37:23.760 --> 37:24.030
damaged.

37:33.880 --> 37:34.480
my car!

39:10.360 --> 39:12.030
stop!

39:33.550 --> 39:34.800
He has already run away, so hurry up and chase him.

39:35.000 --> 39:35.630
Ignore him for now.

39:36.000 --> 39:36.760
Sooner or later you will catch it.

39:37.480 --> 39:38.150
What about you, hard drive?

39:39.440 --> 39:41.230
I think my foot dropped.

39:46.840 --> 39:47.550
Your head is dizzy, isn't it?

39:48.070 --> 39:48.630
A little dizzy.

39:50.400 --> 39:50.880
Ayo.

39:58.000 --> 39:58.360
This guy.

39:58.510 --> 39:59.510
Is he Boss Zhang?

40:00.840 --> 40:01.920
Boss Zhang’s information,

40:02.030 --> 40:02.960
He's a little fuzzy.

40:03.630 --> 40:04.880
We can't be sure either.

40:05.480 --> 40:06.440
He always wears a helmet.

40:06.630 --> 40:07.630
I can't see his face.

40:08.510 --> 40:09.070
I appreciate it.

40:10.110 --> 40:11.630
Wu Xi took the hard drive.

40:12.840 --> 40:13.800
Why was Wu Xi injured?

40:15.320 --> 40:16.150
He's fine.

40:16.800 --> 40:17.190
Now.

40:17.400 --> 40:18.320
Under examination at the hospital.

40:19.630 --> 40:20.070
Di mana Hangyeol?

40:20.230 --> 40:21.510
Now is our only clue.

40:21.670 --> 40:22.630
we have to find a way

40:22.630 --> 40:23.400
Find it.

40:24.150 --> 40:24.510
of.

40:25.070 --> 40:26.710
We were at his place.

40:27.070 --> 40:28.670
and Tuna King Shop.

40:28.920 --> 40:29.710
Everyone is looking at him.

40:30.440 --> 40:30.800
OK

40:31.150 --> 40:31.800
game account

40:31.960 --> 40:32.400
Still there too

40:32.440 --> 40:33.230
within our regulatory scope.

40:33.510 --> 40:34.110
As long as he comes in,

40:34.360 --> 40:35.110
We'll find out.

40:35.840 --> 40:37.000
Also, check him out.

40:37.320 --> 40:38.400
All online transaction records.

40:39.150 --> 40:40.510
see if we can

40:40.800 --> 40:42.000
Find his hiding place.

40:42.440 --> 40:43.110
You are like ports and docks.

40:43.320 --> 40:44.360
This all needs investigation.

40:44.920 --> 40:46.760
He knows this area very well.

40:46.960 --> 40:48.510
The main investigation concerns him.

40:48.590 --> 40:49.070
with him.

40:49.400 --> 40:50.480
Fishermen and traders.

40:51.760 --> 40:52.280
Chief Qin.

40:53.230 --> 40:55.110
This operation failed.

40:55.920 --> 40:56.710
I have a great responsibility.

40:58.070 --> 40:59.070
Your choice is correct.

40:59.550 --> 41:00.670
I would do the same thing.

41:00.840 --> 41:01.510
Don't worry.

41:02.190 --> 41:02.670
besides,

41:02.710 --> 41:04.110
who installed

41:04.630 --> 41:06.030
Who installed it?

41:07.000 --> 41:08.320
Inside the Duane Hotel.

41:08.400 --> 41:08.880
most likely

41:08.920 --> 41:10.030
A spy has infiltrated.

41:10.840 --> 41:11.480
this line.

41:11.590 --> 41:13.360
You should continue to investigate.

41:14.920 --> 41:15.280
understand.

41:15.480 --> 41:15.880
understand.

41:25.360 --> 41:25.920
Yao Yao.

41:28.230 --> 41:28.800
Are you awake?

41:32.550 --> 41:33.480
I have a headache.

41:36.400 --> 41:37.400
Drink water first.

41:38.840 --> 41:39.360
Thanks.

41:41.510 --> 41:42.440
do you remember

41:42.590 --> 41:43.670
What did you say to me yesterday?

41:45.000 --> 41:45.550
What?

41:47.320 --> 41:48.000
your secret.

41:49.280 --> 41:50.230
What secret?

41:53.630 --> 41:54.480
explain.

41:55.230 --> 41:56.190
Do you want to get back into the game?

41:58.320 --> 41:59.400
What else did I tell you?

42:00.760 --> 42:01.880
what else?

42:02.110 --> 42:04.000
Contribute to the country.

42:06.670 --> 42:08.070
Isn't this a mistake?

42:08.550 --> 42:09.190
play games.

42:09.320 --> 42:10.280
what is the relationship

42:10.400 --> 42:10.960
Contribute to the country?

42:11.800 --> 42:13.150
Who knows what you mean?

42:41.230 --> 42:41.800
We'll meet again.

42:41.840 --> 42:42.920
Our flagship agency.

42:45.760 --> 42:47.000
We're all out.

42:48.190 --> 42:48.880
in life,

42:49.630 --> 42:51.190
There are always some things that cannot be done.

42:54.030 --> 42:54.510
this is your room

42:54.550 --> 42:55.510
too small.

42:56.670 --> 42:57.590
I'll change it for you to a bigger one.

42:57.920 --> 42:58.400
unnecessary.
