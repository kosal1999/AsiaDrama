01:42.590 --> 01:43.200
Goodbye, boss.

01:43.509 --> 01:43.920
Goodbye, boss.

01:44.120 --> 01:44.590
See you tomorrow.

01:45.590 --> 01:46.200
I'm leaving first, brother.

01:46.590 --> 01:47.070
goodbye.

06:06.390 --> 06:06.920
Mr. and Mrs.

06:09.720 --> 06:10.270
Mr. and Mrs.

06:44.720 --> 06:45.480
Auntie is back.

06:47.430 --> 06:48.510
Why did you come suddenly?

06:50.190 --> 06:50.720
Isn't this

06:51.870 --> 06:52.630
my colleagues

06:53.390 --> 06:54.070
give me one

06:54.480 --> 06:55.070
I don't smoke.

06:55.480 --> 06:56.720
I brought it to you.

06:58.830 --> 07:00.190
Last year the doctor told me

07:00.240 --> 07:01.480
Quit smoking and drinking.

07:01.720 --> 07:02.270
I've been using it for a few months

07:02.390 --> 07:03.160
no more smoking

07:03.510 --> 07:04.390
That's good

07:06.360 --> 07:07.680
You are not a fishing law enforcement officer

07:07.830 --> 07:08.800
Is it right to test me?

07:09.120 --> 07:10.950
I did not mean that

07:11.480 --> 07:12.270
But honestly

07:12.510 --> 07:13.190
Quitting smoking is not easy.

07:13.310 --> 07:14.070
You must survive.

07:14.630 --> 07:15.750
Are you still quitting candy?

07:16.070 --> 07:16.630
I bought you more.

07:16.800 --> 07:17.430
more

07:17.870 --> 07:19.390
Huang Zicheng bought so many for me

07:19.720 --> 07:20.870
I haven't eaten much lately

07:21.240 --> 07:21.750
No purchase required.

07:22.720 --> 07:23.750
You haven't eaten yet?

07:24.800 --> 07:25.680
I definitely haven’t eaten it yet.

07:25.950 --> 07:26.800
I shouldn't ask

07:27.160 --> 07:28.160
I'll cook for you

07:28.830 --> 07:29.630
Noodles are pretty good

07:31.630 --> 07:32.070
Oh yes.

07:32.600 --> 07:33.950
In that white porcelain jar

07:34.190 --> 07:35.070
It’s this year’s new tea.

07:35.480 --> 07:36.270
Mix it yourself.

07:36.950 --> 07:37.430
OK

07:46.040 --> 07:46.600
What is the word?

07:46.870 --> 07:48.480
I'll invite you out to dinner.

07:49.040 --> 07:50.630
I found a new restaurant.

07:50.800 --> 07:51.360
good.

07:53.120 --> 07:53.800
next time

07:54.360 --> 07:54.920
Wait for Zicheng to come back

07:54.950 --> 07:55.600
let's go together

07:56.600 --> 07:57.159
you can also.

07:58.630 --> 07:59.360
Fried noodles.

08:00.120 --> 08:00.560
OK

08:17.720 --> 08:18.830
People have already arranged it.

08:19.720 --> 08:20.430
5.30pm.

08:21.680 --> 08:22.270
In the town square,

08:22.360 --> 08:23.920
[In the town square. ]

08:24.830 --> 08:25.800
Can he recognize me?

08:26.430 --> 08:27.840
He only knows things, not people.

08:28.840 --> 08:29.320
OK

08:58.080 --> 08:58.670
5.30pm.

08:59.120 --> 09:00.150
In the town square.

09:00.960 --> 09:01.840
I doubt him

09:01.960 --> 09:03.550
There is important information about biological companies.

09:04.600 --> 09:05.270
Biological groups?

09:05.750 --> 09:06.320
of.

10:48.480 --> 10:49.720
Shi Tou, gambar.

10:57.030 --> 10:57.910
The target has emerged.

10:58.630 --> 10:59.150
understand.

11:42.510 --> 11:43.670
The target entered the milk tea shop.

11:56.750 --> 11:57.910
Enter your payment code here.

11:59.790 --> 12:00.320
OK

12:00.790 --> 12:01.960
How are you? This is a receipt for you.

12:02.150 --> 12:02.630
Thanks.

12:03.910 --> 12:04.550
Hello.

12:04.670 --> 12:05.670
give me a cup of black tea

12:05.870 --> 12:06.320
OK

12:08.960 --> 12:10.360
Hello, please scan the QR code to pay.

12:39.720 --> 12:40.670
Parson is here.

12:43.870 --> 12:44.360
Hello.

12:44.960 --> 12:46.600
Hello, I would like a glass of orange juice.

12:46.910 --> 12:47.870
Another cake.

12:48.080 --> 12:48.600
wrap.

12:48.960 --> 12:49.390
OK

12:51.440 --> 12:52.790
Hello, please scan the QR code to pay.

12:56.510 --> 12:57.000
attention.

12:57.000 --> 12:57.910
A new stranger.

14:27.030 --> 14:27.510
Director Qin.

14:28.720 --> 14:29.870
The connection target has been determined.

14:30.270 --> 14:31.390
But the circumstances surrounding the transfer of the goods are unclear.

14:33.390 --> 14:34.630
We have to pay attention to who is coming.

14:34.840 --> 14:35.550
After leaving the market,

14:35.600 --> 14:36.510
After leaving the market.

14:37.030 --> 14:38.080
Don't lose him.

14:38.600 --> 14:39.390
Where is the courier?

14:40.030 --> 14:41.030
If so, the sender will not move first

14:41.270 --> 14:42.080
Just pay attention.

14:42.870 --> 14:43.440
understand.

15:00.270 --> 15:01.000
Someone is following you.

15:02.030 --> 15:02.630
Enter the mall.

15:14.670 --> 15:15.550
You have become a target.

15:16.600 --> 15:17.150
WHO？

15:19.630 --> 15:20.510
For example, the National Security Agency.

15:21.510 --> 15:22.750
The goods must not fall into Guo An's hands.

16:08.390 --> 16:09.120
Target lost.

16:11.320 --> 16:11.790
sun

16:12.240 --> 16:13.600
The sender suddenly disappeared.

16:15.200 --> 16:16.030
Pay attention to the recipient.

16:16.630 --> 16:17.440
The goods are in his hands

16:18.120 --> 16:19.270
I doubt they've noticed

16:21.030 --> 16:22.000
The consignee is ready to go out.

16:40.270 --> 16:40.840
Ada Guo An.

16:41.200 --> 16:41.750
where to.

16:44.600 --> 16:45.150
The item is missing.

16:45.390 --> 16:45.790
Jiang.

16:46.120 --> 16:46.670
Supervise consignees.

17:25.720 --> 17:26.640
why you again

17:27.790 --> 17:28.349
Let me go.

17:29.590 --> 17:30.790
Everyone across the country is safe.

17:31.440 --> 17:32.310
You can't go out anymore.

17:33.240 --> 17:34.160
I must go.

17:35.030 --> 17:35.640
if not,

17:36.350 --> 17:36.960
complete you

17:38.200 --> 17:39.750
You can't leave here with your stuff.

17:43.720 --> 17:44.510
Just change your clothes and leave.

17:45.160 --> 17:45.790
Give me that thing.

17:46.440 --> 17:47.510
There's no use them arresting you.

17:50.070 --> 17:51.270
They'll see you soon.

17:51.440 --> 17:52.200
Time is running out.

18:06.790 --> 18:07.350
Where is that thing?

18:17.350 --> 18:18.200
you are right.

18:19.350 --> 18:20.110
The item is missing.

18:21.310 --> 18:22.480
It's no use for them to catch me.

18:23.440 --> 18:24.270
What do you mean?

18:24.830 --> 18:25.640
before i know

18:25.720 --> 18:26.920
who betrayed me

18:28.480 --> 18:29.310
It's possible for anyone

18:31.920 --> 18:32.480
Go north.

18:44.640 --> 18:45.070
Where are the people?

18:45.640 --> 18:46.070
Already published

18:46.920 --> 18:47.480
Where is this item?

18:48.000 --> 18:48.510
It was ruined.

18:49.030 --> 18:49.400
Gao Ke

18:49.550 --> 18:50.640
The recipient of the shipment has been controlled.

18:51.200 --> 18:52.350
Well, I'll go now

19:29.310 --> 19:30.510
Do you see what's inside?

19:32.920 --> 19:33.720
It should be a sample.

19:35.750 --> 19:36.400
In biological companies,

19:36.480 --> 19:37.550
There are indeed nails.

19:40.440 --> 19:41.550
You let him go on purpose again.

19:42.480 --> 19:42.920
catch him.

19:42.960 --> 19:44.200
He won't tell anyone.

19:46.440 --> 19:47.350
He still doesn't believe you.

19:48.030 --> 19:49.070
Not that easy.

19:51.640 --> 19:52.400
How to make a head start

19:52.510 --> 19:53.750
See us?

19:56.270 --> 19:56.880
I guess

19:56.960 --> 19:57.880
beside him

19:59.510 --> 20:00.030
spy

20:04.270 --> 20:05.720
This is our negligence

20:17.070 --> 20:17.920
How was it exposed?

20:19.750 --> 20:20.310
have no idea.

20:22.640 --> 20:23.070
your identity

20:23.110 --> 20:24.110
Only Gao Tian knows

20:25.160 --> 20:26.030
he let me go

20:28.640 --> 20:29.350
Where are the samples?

20:30.680 --> 20:31.110
It was ruined.

20:32.270 --> 20:32.920
sample.

20:33.480 --> 20:34.510
Don't fall into Guo An's hands.

20:36.240 --> 20:37.510
Now, he's your ace.

20:38.880 --> 20:39.960
You must protect him.

20:43.790 --> 20:44.310
I know.

20:48.720 --> 20:49.200
Bassoon.

20:49.510 --> 20:50.720
He is a sailor.

20:50.960 --> 20:51.680
Code car driver.

20:52.160 --> 20:53.070
Responsible for sending information.

20:53.510 --> 20:54.200
but he doesn't know

20:54.200 --> 20:55.000
About Jin Hai’s condition.

20:56.590 --> 20:57.640
He is just a courier

20:59.030 --> 20:59.790
Our goal

21:00.240 --> 21:01.270
It's a big hidden fish

21:01.750 --> 21:03.000
In Bio Group.

21:17.200 --> 21:17.960
I warned you.

21:19.070 --> 21:20.480
Stop looking for trouble.

21:21.790 --> 21:23.030
Someone doubted me.

21:26.200 --> 21:27.510
Your female colleague?

21:28.510 --> 21:29.400
before you act,

21:29.590 --> 21:30.960
You'd better tell me first.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.110
I can't save you every time.

21:36.400 --> 21:37.070
Go to the department head.

21:39.160 --> 21:39.880
Why do I think so?

21:39.880 --> 21:40.440
look

21:40.480 --> 21:41.830
every move of mine

21:42.440 --> 21:43.480
Because you have a problem,

21:44.790 --> 21:45.880
I'm going to be in trouble.

21:48.590 --> 21:50.240
That's fine if you think so.

21:53.160 --> 21:54.920
Asking questions, this time it’s the National Security Bureau

21:55.750 --> 21:57.400
How do you know we've met?

21:59.480 --> 22:00.440
we got the message

22:02.310 --> 22:03.310
car driver

22:03.440 --> 22:04.550
Yakabus members enter the country.

22:07.270 --> 22:09.030
I suspect he's here to get information.

22:10.720 --> 22:11.750
We've been watching him for a long time.

22:14.030 --> 22:15.880
I didn't realize you were the one who sent the message.

22:18.960 --> 22:20.000
I can not

22:21.240 --> 22:22.640
I can't find a weakness.

22:23.400 --> 22:24.590
Since Yaoqie doesn’t trust me,

22:26.430 --> 22:27.830
You don’t have to look for me anymore

22:31.550 --> 22:32.880
They can't find you.

22:34.920 --> 22:35.830
Can I?

22:38.270 --> 22:39.400
I want to believe you.

22:40.440 --> 22:42.030
What about the man you trust?

22:45.110 --> 22:46.510
Do you want me to cook for you?

22:47.400 --> 22:48.510
You helped me today.

22:49.510 --> 22:50.350
I haven't thanked you yet.

22:54.160 --> 22:54.750
at your side,

22:54.750 --> 22:56.030
bukan Xiao Yi saja, kan?

22:56.440 --> 22:56.960
certainly.

23:01.510 --> 23:02.590
But I'm not as good as you.

23:06.310 --> 23:07.000
sorry.

23:08.550 --> 23:09.920
I don't like sharing with others

23:40.960 --> 23:41.880
Another girl

23:44.830 --> 23:45.640
You don't gossip

23:46.310 --> 23:47.030
This is a sponsor

23:47.440 --> 23:48.030
I'm here to buy

23:48.030 --> 23:49.160
The material in Crow's hand.

23:50.070 --> 23:50.920
I asked him out

23:51.110 --> 23:51.830
ask him out

23:53.920 --> 23:54.830
he gave it to me

23:55.880 --> 23:56.790
He gave it to me.

23:57.030 --> 23:57.880
This is this time

23:59.000 --> 24:00.400
Boss, be generous.

24:01.510 --> 24:02.160
Wu Senlin

24:02.480 --> 24:03.510
people with background

24:04.790 --> 24:05.440
please sign in.

24:09.310 --> 24:09.920
Gentlemen.

24:10.160 --> 24:10.680
Please come up.

24:17.550 --> 24:19.160
The materials in Crow's hands are quite popular.

24:19.480 --> 24:20.680
Sources say a buyer has been found.

24:21.310 --> 24:21.920
if not for

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
owe me a favor

24:23.350 --> 24:24.750
he won't face me

24:26.150 --> 24:27.030
Found a buyer.

24:27.270 --> 24:27.680
of.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.240
It is understood that he has already paid the deposit.

24:29.960 --> 24:30.590
He's inside.

24:30.880 --> 24:31.480
speak slowly

24:44.550 --> 24:45.030
sit down.

24:58.110 --> 24:58.750
that's right.

24:59.310 --> 25:00.400
Someone paid a deposit

25:01.510 --> 25:02.070
Want to chat more?

25:04.310 --> 25:05.270
yes?

25:06.310 --> 25:07.030
Two days ago,

25:07.750 --> 25:08.830
Looks like what's in your hand

25:09.030 --> 25:09.880
it's not easy

25:10.480 --> 25:11.000
certainly.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.000
If we offer a higher price,

25:13.680 --> 25:14.720
Can we

25:15.640 --> 25:16.790
No matter how high the price is, it can’t be sold.

25:16.880 --> 25:17.590
This is the rule.

25:19.750 --> 25:20.550
Please next time

25:21.110 --> 25:22.160
We had the opportunity to work together.

25:22.680 --> 25:23.070
OK

25:23.880 --> 25:24.680
I also want to search

25:24.790 --> 25:25.550
stable buyer

25:25.830 --> 25:27.240
It's easy and safe.

25:27.480 --> 25:27.830
of.

25:29.110 --> 25:30.480
But how can I be sure

25:30.920 --> 25:31.830
Materials in your hand

25:32.310 --> 25:33.440
Only sell to me.

25:34.640 --> 25:35.440
I said,

25:35.510 --> 25:37.030
Business activities must abide by the rules.

25:37.440 --> 25:38.200
If not later

25:38.720 --> 25:39.240
Neither will anyone else

25:39.240 --> 25:40.070
Buy something from me.

25:40.790 --> 25:41.680
In the world of agents

25:41.680 --> 25:42.590
There are no rules.

25:43.200 --> 25:43.830
Offline transactions

25:44.400 --> 25:45.310
Eliminate face-to-face copying

25:45.350 --> 25:46.070
is the safest.

25:46.680 --> 25:47.310
impossible.

25:47.640 --> 25:49.000
i won't see you

25:49.880 --> 25:50.510
agent game

25:50.510 --> 25:52.070
It is the safest trading market

25:52.920 --> 25:53.920
If you don't accept it,

25:54.830 --> 25:56.030
We can no longer work together.

25:56.920 --> 25:58.070
Be your buyer this time

25:58.110 --> 25:59.160
Do you accept online transactions?

25:59.920 --> 26:00.590
certainly.

26:01.070 --> 26:02.030
who is he?

26:02.480 --> 26:03.440
Is he a philosophy student?

26:05.960 --> 26:06.960
This has nothing to do with you.

26:08.160 --> 26:09.240
If he is a person who studies philosophy,

26:09.920 --> 26:10.590
your transaction

26:10.720 --> 26:11.640
It won't be that easy.

26:12.240 --> 26:13.240
He will cause you trouble.

26:15.400 --> 26:16.270
Have a question for me?

26:17.000 --> 26:18.200
He might find you.

26:21.960 --> 26:23.160
Do you know where I am?

26:24.310 --> 26:25.350
Have you read Jae-chul

26:27.030 --> 26:28.200
who are you?

26:29.000 --> 26:29.960
I'm here for

26:29.960 --> 26:30.590
with you

26:31.400 --> 26:32.550
but i care more

26:32.960 --> 26:33.880
your safety

26:37.720 --> 26:38.960
You are not here to trade.

26:39.510 --> 26:40.640
do not waste time.

26:50.550 --> 26:51.640
How can you be sure?

26:51.960 --> 26:53.070
He reads Jae Cheol's works

26:54.000 --> 26:55.240
I wasn't sure before this

26:55.880 --> 26:57.110
But his earlier response

26:57.720 --> 26:58.880
In principle it is certain.

26:59.680 --> 27:00.880
He can still go out now

27:01.310 --> 27:01.960
significance

27:02.270 --> 27:03.270
He is safe for now.

27:04.480 --> 27:05.960
We can find Jae-chul reading a book

27:06.310 --> 27:07.400
Even the Nightmist can do it.

27:08.270 --> 27:09.240
So his current situation

27:09.240 --> 27:09.880
very dangerous.

27:10.310 --> 27:11.830
We must find him immediately.

27:12.720 --> 27:13.550
Many people are reading philosophy books.

27:14.030 --> 27:14.640
How to find it?

27:18.830 --> 27:20.070
I heard your conversation didn't go well.

27:21.720 --> 27:22.440
what did he say?

27:23.270 --> 27:24.510
He said you were insincere

27:25.030 --> 27:25.880
and wanted to deceive him

27:26.550 --> 27:27.110
no

27:27.400 --> 27:27.880
Tauke Wu

27:27.880 --> 27:29.160
Want to deal with him offline

27:29.720 --> 27:30.440
he doesn't agree

27:31.590 --> 27:32.550
this game

27:32.920 --> 27:33.550
Who wants to reveal something?

27:33.640 --> 27:34.750
one's true identity

27:35.000 --> 27:35.480
after all,

27:35.640 --> 27:37.160
He still lives with leaks

27:39.400 --> 27:41.200
I found you

27:41.310 --> 27:42.000
quite profitable

27:42.200 --> 27:42.790
When did you recommend me?

27:43.000 --> 27:44.350
Are you still going to your hacker league?

27:45.750 --> 27:47.000
It's enough.

27:47.200 --> 27:48.350
Be careful the police will find you.

27:49.640 --> 27:50.070
Oh yes.

27:50.440 --> 27:51.480
Usually, he works for the same company.

27:51.550 --> 27:52.350
How long does he work?

27:54.070 --> 27:56.160
The time is short, one or two years.

27:56.270 --> 27:57.920
If it is slow, it may take more than three years.

27:58.270 --> 27:59.400
See when he

27:59.440 --> 28:00.880
Get the material he wants.

28:02.510 --> 28:03.070
OK

28:05.070 --> 28:06.480
Me too

28:07.000 --> 28:08.270
Offend your friends.

28:08.880 --> 28:09.480
It doesn't matter.

28:09.960 --> 28:10.590
Decide to start a business

28:10.720 --> 28:11.480
There is no separation.

28:12.160 --> 28:13.240
I like this girl.

28:15.160 --> 28:16.510
How do you know I'm a girl?

28:18.000 --> 28:18.920
we are best friends.

28:20.880 --> 28:21.510
You hate it.

28:21.750 --> 28:22.960
she's just a girl

28:25.880 --> 28:26.400
Thanks.

28:26.590 --> 28:27.510
I'll call you next time.

28:28.030 --> 28:28.550
OK

28:30.110 --> 28:31.110
Come on, miss.

28:41.720 --> 28:42.510
I know how to investigate.

28:43.550 --> 28:43.960
Speech.

28:45.510 --> 28:46.110
look.

28:46.510 --> 28:48.270
He got important information

28:48.790 --> 28:49.680
and find a buyer.

28:50.350 --> 28:51.160
The next step is

28:51.240 --> 28:52.400
Resign and get out of here.

28:53.000 --> 28:53.790
your previous question

28:53.790 --> 28:54.510
It must be interesting

28:54.550 --> 28:55.270
his attention.

28:55.880 --> 28:56.960
He will go faster.

28:59.480 --> 29:00.000
make sense.

29:05.960 --> 29:06.680
I think

29:08.680 --> 29:09.680
we can try

29:10.270 --> 29:11.030
Ask Yaoyao for help.

29:12.030 --> 29:12.720
Yao Yao

29:13.550 --> 29:14.400
he is reading

29:14.750 --> 29:15.830
Ask him to help investigate this person

29:17.750 --> 29:18.790
No, Yaoyao can't.

29:19.160 --> 29:20.350
His status is not suitable for intervention

29:20.640 --> 29:21.510
We suspect someone

29:21.510 --> 29:22.350
There is night fog.

29:22.720 --> 29:23.240
our investigation

29:23.240 --> 29:24.240
It must be done in secret.

29:24.590 --> 29:25.590
How do we investigate?

29:30.550 --> 29:31.160
hunter.

29:33.240 --> 29:34.880
Hunting companies dominate

29:35.000 --> 29:35.480
All resignation information

29:35.590 --> 29:37.070
and information about employees who are resigning.

29:37.550 --> 29:37.960
we can pass

29:38.030 --> 29:38.880
through this channel

29:41.310 --> 29:42.680
Awesome, Sister Xi

29:43.310 --> 29:44.590
give it to me.

29:45.030 --> 29:46.400
I know people from hunting companies.

29:46.680 --> 29:47.920
Why does everyone know each other?

29:48.440 --> 29:49.440
when i graduate,

29:49.590 --> 29:50.720
With my excellent experience,

29:50.880 --> 29:52.350
[My resume is outstanding. ]

29:52.510 --> 29:53.240
invite

29:53.550 --> 29:55.270
Finally I refused.

29:55.550 --> 29:56.830
Don't you want to be blacklisted?

29:57.110 --> 29:58.070
Don't worry.

29:58.720 --> 29:59.920
not like this.

30:00.640 --> 30:02.200
split in trade

30:02.400 --> 30:03.920
We also have people in our hunting company

30:04.200 --> 30:05.350
If you are so proactive

30:05.640 --> 30:07.160
I can only suspect that you have other motives.

30:07.350 --> 30:07.920
I do this to...

30:08.070 --> 30:09.400
For national security.

30:09.590 --> 30:10.640
You do this for someone.

30:10.830 --> 30:11.510
small.

30:11.790 --> 30:13.400
If you think of it this way, the pattern is very small.

30:26.240 --> 30:27.440
I go first, you run

30:28.070 --> 30:29.070
Don't run away, bye.

30:51.680 --> 30:53.270
I left the keys at home.

30:53.550 --> 30:54.590
I will go to your house.

30:55.720 --> 30:57.880
My house is a mess. Only next time.

30:58.720 --> 30:59.880
You are looking for an important company.

31:01.200 --> 31:02.480
My car is here, I'm leaving first.

31:06.920 --> 31:08.510
Why can't we leave after we break up?

31:38.240 --> 31:38.640
Geshe

31:38.920 --> 31:39.830
from hunter

31:39.920 --> 31:41.400
Latest information received

31:41.480 --> 31:42.350
Newest

31:42.750 --> 31:44.400
include

31:44.550 --> 31:45.030
who is ready to resign

31:45.160 --> 31:46.030
and intends to resign

31:46.200 --> 31:46.830
and their resume.

31:46.830 --> 31:47.400
Also inside.

31:47.790 --> 31:48.830
I sent you an email.

31:55.240 --> 31:56.270
Thanks.

32:11.590 --> 32:12.110
The job is done.

33:16.160 --> 33:16.790
wake up.

33:17.440 --> 33:18.160
Can't sleep well

33:24.160 --> 33:26.750
I don't go to bed until four o'clock

33:29.720 --> 33:31.400
I changed my bag again today

33:33.270 --> 33:33.830
Is this beautiful?

33:34.400 --> 33:35.310
limited edition

33:35.680 --> 33:36.030
I don't want to buy it.

33:36.030 --> 33:37.070
I will regret it for a year.

33:38.160 --> 33:38.960
During this year,

33:39.110 --> 33:40.350
only a meager salary

33:40.750 --> 33:42.550
I’ve bought a bag, what do you want to eat?

33:43.200 --> 33:44.030
I eat you

33:44.350 --> 33:44.920
If I don't have money,

33:45.000 --> 33:46.070
You can't see me starving

33:48.480 --> 33:49.400
Don't count on it.

33:52.070 --> 33:53.200
I checked yesterday.

33:53.480 --> 33:54.310
Last few years,

33:54.480 --> 33:55.350
some scandal

33:55.510 --> 33:56.640
on other internet platforms.

33:57.240 --> 33:58.200
some people

33:58.790 --> 34:00.160
thereby leaking user privacy

34:00.750 --> 34:02.320
And those who fake clicks

34:02.510 --> 34:03.590
Who deliberately manipulates the topic.

34:04.760 --> 34:06.280
They have one thing in common.

34:06.960 --> 34:07.880
There must be someone

34:08.110 --> 34:09.280
into them

34:09.800 --> 34:10.710
from a technical point of view

34:10.920 --> 34:12.110
From a technical perspective.

34:13.510 --> 34:14.710
In fact, it's a scandal

34:14.920 --> 34:16.550
In the end the truth was not revealed.

34:16.920 --> 34:17.760
Everything will end.

34:19.030 --> 34:19.670
you think

34:19.840 --> 34:20.670
This time our crisis

34:20.840 --> 34:22.880
Not one thing.

34:23.070 --> 34:24.190
But done by the same group.

34:25.070 --> 34:26.280
they use the same method

34:26.429 --> 34:27.630
Also used to threaten other platforms

34:27.840 --> 34:28.800
and succeeded.

34:30.630 --> 34:31.110
if

34:31.280 --> 34:32.480
As I expected,

34:32.960 --> 34:33.800
Then this guy

34:34.280 --> 34:35.480
maybe once

34:35.510 --> 34:36.190
In some iQiyi.

34:37.630 --> 34:38.190
continue.

34:41.190 --> 34:42.590
I investigated Shi Qi's information.

34:44.110 --> 34:45.630
He has worked for Company A for two years.

34:46.030 --> 34:46.710
During this period,

34:46.960 --> 34:48.510
The company has also had its share of scandals.

34:49.480 --> 34:50.880
According to the resume,

34:52.190 --> 34:53.280
Shi Qi.

34:53.670 --> 34:55.190
Indeed he was suspected.

34:57.590 --> 34:58.480
if it's not the first time

34:58.510 --> 34:59.590
do something like this,

35:00.480 --> 35:01.230
It turns out

35:01.280 --> 35:02.400
he made a lot of money

35:02.480 --> 35:04.150
through this channel

35:05.320 --> 35:06.030
so

35:06.320 --> 35:07.030
his financial status

35:07.190 --> 35:08.150
Absolutely good

35:09.550 --> 35:10.510
But look, Principal Zhou

35:11.070 --> 35:12.070
him on the address page

35:12.320 --> 35:13.630
Full of ordinary neighborhoods.

35:14.960 --> 35:16.400
Although I have never been to his house

35:16.630 --> 35:17.760
But I searched online.

35:18.150 --> 35:19.880
The area is quite remote

35:20.030 --> 35:21.000
The rent is also cheap.

35:22.280 --> 35:23.880
After all, he is not rich

35:24.630 --> 35:26.070
He is not a rich man.

35:27.280 --> 35:28.110
Could it be him

35:28.150 --> 35:28.880
deliberately hidden

35:28.880 --> 35:29.800
own money

35:32.630 --> 35:33.480
Who are you

35:33.710 --> 35:34.710
The son of the invisible millionaire

35:34.960 --> 35:35.960
There is a mine at home.

35:37.630 --> 35:38.280
I admit

35:43.710 --> 35:44.440
imitate

35:45.630 --> 35:46.440
is that true

35:47.440 --> 35:48.760
This work is quite good

35:49.030 --> 35:50.190
Yes, I think so too.

35:51.360 --> 35:52.190
Can't see this

35:52.230 --> 35:53.670
Later you refused to give me this land

35:53.920 --> 35:54.320
Yes.

35:54.800 --> 35:55.400
no problem

36:00.400 --> 36:01.150
what do you think?

36:06.070 --> 36:08.030
He always buys luxury goods.

36:09.030 --> 36:10.110
But he told me,

36:10.440 --> 36:11.480
all fake.

36:12.670 --> 36:13.800
The conversation still needs to be discussed.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.030
But I think,

36:15.710 --> 36:16.510
You can continue to investigate

36:16.670 --> 36:17.670
Continue to investigate

36:18.440 --> 36:19.510
if necessary

36:20.360 --> 36:21.630
Use a little trick.

36:23.280 --> 36:23.920
For example

36:25.360 --> 36:26.670
For example, record a conversation

36:26.750 --> 36:28.190
Or the reality of his family.

36:33.550 --> 36:33.960
this...

36:34.110 --> 36:35.070
You are a friend.

36:35.550 --> 36:36.840
It doesn't seem difficult to you.

36:41.320 --> 36:41.800
Yao Yao.

36:43.070 --> 36:44.280
I know you.

36:44.630 --> 36:46.480
Don't you want to know?

36:47.230 --> 36:47.710
what friends do you have

36:47.800 --> 36:49.030
for you?

36:53.960 --> 36:54.400
OK

36:55.000 --> 36:55.630
Let me try.

37:10.630 --> 37:11.110
Why?

37:15.070 --> 37:16.320
I want to change my job.

37:18.630 --> 37:19.800
Why suddenly?

37:20.030 --> 37:20.800
what happen?

37:20.920 --> 37:22.190
It has been a long time.

37:22.440 --> 37:23.510
The hunter dug me out.

37:23.800 --> 37:24.630
My heart was pounding.

37:28.030 --> 37:29.960
Which company do you want to go to?

37:31.880 --> 37:32.880
Three major game companies

37:33.230 --> 37:34.070
I have not decided yet.

37:35.280 --> 37:36.320
Have you mentioned it to the staff?

37:36.400 --> 37:36.880
of.

37:39.320 --> 37:40.630
No, you've thought about it

37:41.000 --> 37:41.590
you make a decision

37:41.590 --> 37:42.670
Just leave me like this?

37:43.670 --> 37:45.440
You want to go to your boss

37:45.670 --> 37:46.840
I'm bored living here.

37:47.880 --> 37:48.630
But some of these companies

37:48.710 --> 37:49.400
Everything is nearby.

37:49.760 --> 37:51.110
We can play together again.

37:52.150 --> 37:52.760
Si Qi.

37:53.840 --> 37:54.670
Let's sign autographs.

38:24.630 --> 38:25.190
Geshe

38:27.000 --> 38:27.550
between them,

38:27.760 --> 38:28.710
i know someone

38:29.110 --> 38:30.000
Zhou Si Qi?

38:31.510 --> 38:31.960
of.

38:32.630 --> 38:33.760
He is Yaoyao's best friend.

38:35.110 --> 38:35.760
I've investigated

38:35.760 --> 38:36.760
his past

38:37.400 --> 38:38.030
you don't speak

38:38.880 --> 38:39.800
Very similar indeed

38:40.400 --> 38:41.230
We've checked.

38:41.480 --> 38:42.630
The best person for Crow's situation.

38:42.670 --> 38:43.320
So does he.

38:44.760 --> 38:45.550
but...

38:46.630 --> 38:47.710
He is not a crow.

38:48.150 --> 38:49.400
why is it impossible

38:50.360 --> 38:51.630
Jiang Xiaohua reminded me

38:52.280 --> 38:52.710
hacker

38:52.920 --> 38:53.480
Can be disguised

38:53.630 --> 38:54.510
own identity.

38:54.960 --> 38:56.920
I was surprised he was a crow.

38:57.920 --> 38:58.760
Have you had any contact with him?

38:59.590 --> 39:00.030
No.

39:00.280 --> 39:00.630
But isn't he?

39:00.630 --> 39:01.590
Yaoyao's best friend?

39:01.800 --> 39:03.280
Before that, I always heard Yao Ming mention him.

39:04.000 --> 39:04.440
you say

39:05.630 --> 39:06.840
Yaoyao's identity, he

39:08.230 --> 39:09.710
Why is it so complicated?

39:10.510 --> 39:10.800
OK

39:10.920 --> 39:12.110
We'll take care of the rest.

39:13.360 --> 39:14.230
What should I do next?

39:15.030 --> 39:16.070
continue working.

39:16.360 --> 39:17.400
If anything happens I will contact you.

39:19.320 --> 39:20.590
Are you leaving me again?

39:20.880 --> 39:22.000
of course not

39:22.710 --> 39:23.760
your abilities in the game

39:23.960 --> 39:25.230
Really helped us.

39:26.710 --> 39:27.230
Geshe

39:27.510 --> 39:29.230
You are more loyal than Gao Tianyang.

39:29.960 --> 39:31.000
I'll tell him on your behalf.

39:31.590 --> 39:32.030
goodbye.

39:44.030 --> 39:45.070
Shi Qi will resign.

39:46.320 --> 39:46.840
I know.

39:47.320 --> 39:48.510
This is no coincidence, right?

39:49.070 --> 39:50.280
The goal has been achieved.

39:50.630 --> 39:51.710
Definitely need to be ready to go.

39:54.840 --> 39:55.550
I've looked into it.

39:56.480 --> 39:57.440
his bag

39:57.800 --> 39:58.670
it is true.

40:00.840 --> 40:02.150
It seems that he deliberately concealed it

40:02.150 --> 40:03.360
own financial ability.

40:06.030 --> 40:07.030
Now it seems

40:07.880 --> 40:08.840
Mr. Zhou, you are right

40:09.840 --> 40:10.630
I might

40:11.280 --> 40:12.320
don't understand him

40:13.920 --> 40:14.440
his address

40:14.440 --> 40:15.710
is fake.

40:17.480 --> 40:18.360
please let me investigate

40:18.480 --> 40:19.590
where does he live

40:20.960 --> 40:21.360
OK

40:21.800 --> 40:22.510
Look for opportunities.

40:22.800 --> 40:23.760
I'll go see it with him

40:25.280 --> 40:26.360
Don't let him notice.

40:26.550 --> 40:27.150
Be careful.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.070
if there is nothing

40:31.280 --> 40:31.920
I go first.

40:32.230 --> 40:32.710
Go to work.

41:16.110 --> 41:17.630
I found someone who asked me to investigate.

41:18.440 --> 41:19.150
soon

41:20.670 --> 41:21.590
Yaoyao is very smart

41:22.920 --> 41:23.590
You just sent it to him

41:23.760 --> 41:25.030
In order to attract Huang Zicheng,

41:25.760 --> 41:27.110
it's useless

41:29.710 --> 41:30.510
useless

41:31.110 --> 41:32.000
Neither can Mr. Yu

41:32.030 --> 41:33.000
at your place

41:35.550 --> 41:36.710
but a smart man

41:38.280 --> 41:39.550
Usually not very obedient.

41:41.280 --> 41:42.280
I will educate him well.

41:44.030 --> 41:45.360
Bagi Zhou Si Qi,

41:46.960 --> 41:48.590
Please take care of me, Boss Zhang.

41:49.710 --> 41:50.630
take it out

41:50.630 --> 41:51.440
In his hands.

41:53.110 --> 41:53.590
Don't worry.

41:54.800 --> 41:55.840
I'll take care of it.

41:56.880 --> 41:57.440
That's very good.

42:09.760 --> 42:11.070
You repeat what he said.

42:14.590 --> 42:15.280
useless

42:16.030 --> 42:16.800
Neither can Mr. Yu

42:16.920 --> 42:17.960
at your place

42:20.480 --> 42:21.510
but a smart man

42:23.110 --> 42:24.480
Usually not very obedient.

42:25.630 --> 42:26.280
Don't worry.

42:27.280 --> 42:28.360
I'll take care of it.

42:30.320 --> 42:31.110
Just to name a few such poems

42:32.110 --> 42:32.510
of.

42:32.760 --> 42:33.670
So incomplete.
