I left the car running.

01:50.180 --> 01:51.220
Turn off the car for me.

02:04.150 --> 02:05.380
The supplier of this izakaya.

02:06.510 --> 02:08.160
This seems like a normal relationship.

02:09.180 --> 02:09.979
but everyone

02:10.020 --> 02:11.260
It has something to do with the boss lady.

02:11.620 --> 02:12.610
Then the situation is not simple.

02:14.190 --> 02:15.280

She returned to China two years ago,

02:35.050 --> 02:36.360
And opened this izakaya.

02:40.230 --> 02:41.720
She appears to have a clean record.

02:41.740 --> 02:43.090
Nothing suspicious.

Let's go have another meal. I'll entertain you.

No.

Go yourself.

Have you closed the door?

03:23.110 --> 03:23.930
It doesn't matter.

But the chef has gone off duty.

03:35.070 --> 03:36.870
I'll cook for you.

04:13.700 --> 04:14.350
perfect.

04:17.110 --> 04:19.420
Why are you here alone today?

04:20.940 --> 04:21.579
Myself,

04:21.579 --> 04:22.900
You can focus more on the food.

04:25.070 --> 04:25.790
That makes sense.

04:25.910 --> 04:26.480
Have fun.

04:27.370 --> 04:27.960
Thanks.

This is enough.

04:51.980 --> 04:52.870

Won't you have a drink?

04:55.490 --> 04:56.330
wine?

04:57.070 --> 04:57.890

05:24.340 --> 05:25.100
More than two years.

05:27.820 --> 05:29.050
According to your accent,

05:29.140 --> 05:30.220
You don't sound like a local, do you?

05:31.460 --> 05:32.780
My parents are from Jinhai.

05:33.380 --> 05:34.460
Then they went abroad.

05:35.340 --> 05:36.420
Now they are old,

05:36.500 --> 05:37.730
They really want to come back.

05:38.860 --> 05:40.270
So I will come back and open a restaurant first

05:40.370 --> 05:41.040
Look how things are going here.

05:42.580 --> 05:43.940

05:43.940 --> 05:44.659

05:46.100 --> 05:47.500
Not low. correct?

05:48.550 --> 05:49.630
it's good now.

05:50.300 --> 05:52.050
Two years ago,

05:52.330 --> 05:53.590
It was not a popular place.

05:54.040 --> 05:55.570
I rented this place

05:55.610 --> 05:56.530
Because the rent is low.

05:58.010 --> 05:59.050
You have a good eye.

05:59.870 --> 06:01.230
There is a company

06:01.250 --> 06:02.710

06:02.740 --> 06:03.350
Are they?

06:03.390 --> 06:04.270
Do you come here often?

06:04.710 --> 06:05.950
Yes. Often indeed.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.100
What's your signature dish?

06:14.950 --> 06:16.180
There are many types of barbecue food,

06:16.230 --> 06:18.210
Such as grilled fish, grilled skewers,

06:18.470 --> 06:20.320
and a variety of sashimi.

06:20.830 --> 06:22.470
But good sashimi is not common.

06:22.690 --> 06:23.520
It depends on fate.

06:24.130 --> 06:25.420
Does eating depend on fate?

06:25.500 --> 06:26.050
certainly.

06:27.480 --> 06:28.220
Well, I found

06:28.220 --> 06:29.580
Supplies from your suppliers

06:29.600 --> 06:30.290
Unstable.

06:31.130 --> 06:32.140
Sashimi

06:32.180 --> 06:32.900
Provided by our suppliers

06:32.980 --> 06:34.230
It is imported from Norway.

06:34.920 --> 06:35.730
Actually I often

06:35.780 --> 06:36.570
Go to the seafood market.

06:37.159 --> 06:38.130
but,

06:38.520 --> 06:39.600
I can't tell if this is good or bad.

06:39.990 --> 06:41.180
Which supplier do you buy from?

06:45.770 --> 06:47.370
Are you asking me for my secret?

06:50.390 --> 06:51.390
You noticed.

06:52.230 --> 06:53.460
It is clear.

06:56.190 --> 06:57.220
Let me tell you the truth.

06:57.790 --> 07:00.190
I got it from another restaurant

07:00.690 --> 07:01.930
Ask about your purchasing channel.

07:05.900 --> 07:07.970
Obviously you are not suitable for this profession.

07:07.990 --> 07:09.030
Is it obvious?

07:09.830 --> 07:10.850
When it comes to ordering food,

07:10.880 --> 07:11.820
Worse than that girl

07:11.850 --> 07:13.130
Last time I was with you.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.960
Her performance is flawless.

07:21.420 --> 07:22.420
she said

07:22.450 --> 07:23.510
It’s no different than information.

07:24.090 --> 07:25.210
The food is really good.

07:25.970 --> 07:27.130
She created a complete image.

07:30.540 --> 07:31.140
that's all?

07:32.580 --> 07:33.440
That's it for now.

07:34.140 --> 07:34.980
your meal

07:34.980 --> 07:35.850
not worth it.

07:36.110 --> 07:37.159
Don't say that.

07:37.750 --> 07:38.380
something

07:38.400 --> 07:39.440
You look nice.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.790
It may be useful in the future.

07:42.380 --> 07:44.360
Your emotional intelligence hasn’t improved much.

07:44.810 --> 07:45.820
You must go again.

07:45.850 --> 07:46.860
Go more often

07:48.560 --> 07:49.450
it depends.

07:51.100 --> 07:51.540
if you

07:51.540 --> 07:52.700
find anything,

07:52.920 --> 07:54.080
This will definitely waste food.

I want to get on that cruise ship.

08:47.890 --> 08:48.530
What is the solution?

08:49.190 --> 08:50.390
I'll add a plugin for you.

08:50.470 --> 08:51.110
OK

09:00.710 --> 09:01.700
Hello. Hello.

09:03.270 --> 09:03.780

09:20.780 --> 09:21.700
Then he fled to Jinhai.

09:23.390 --> 09:25.500
Once it falls into the enemy's hands,

09:25.870 --> 09:27.280
The consequences will be disastrous.

09:28.190 --> 09:30.970
Spies, please go get the documents.

09:33.090 --> 09:33.620
this mission

09:33.620 --> 09:34.700
Sounds simple.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.630
[mistake]

09:37.080 --> 09:38.940
The second task is not easy.

09:39.530 --> 09:41.780
You have to face the real test.

09:42.150 --> 09:43.030
even

09:44.120 --> 09:45.520
In danger.

09:51.230 --> 09:52.540
I wish you success.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.070
Boss Zhang said this task

10:07.100 --> 10:07.920
It could endanger our lives.

10:09.300 --> 10:10.150
Are you afraid?

10:10.310 --> 10:11.440
of course not.

10:11.460 --> 10:12.140
I'm not afraid to go to Bangkok

10:12.170 --> 10:13.510
Let alone return to Jinhai.

10:13.570 --> 10:14.300
I'm just thinking

10:14.300 --> 10:15.260
Why are there so few clues?

10:15.260 --> 10:16.340
In this mission?

10:16.670 --> 10:19.340
There will always be clues.

10:20.770 --> 10:21.580
I'm offline.

10:22.580 --> 10:23.570
Are you not going to play for a while?

10:24.530 --> 10:25.550
I will be very busy tomorrow.

10:25.580 --> 10:26.550
rest early.

10:40.460 --> 10:42.050
The professor's account is encrypted.

10:43.200 --> 10:43.910
In the game,

10:43.980 --> 10:45.020
He wears a black cloak.

10:46.900 --> 10:48.000
Hee, it's done.

10:48.550 --> 10:50.080
I made a stealth plugin for you.

10:50.270 --> 10:51.350
But hurry up.

10:51.380 --> 10:52.810
You will be detected at any time.

10:53.120 --> 10:53.720
OK

11:56.230 --> 11:57.550
Yu Xiaoyue was arrested.

11:58.870 --> 11:59.870
Why?

12:00.300 --> 12:01.010
no loopholes

12:01.050 --> 12:02.080
in our actions.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.940
I suspect she was panicking

12:05.300 --> 12:07.100
and exposed something

12:07.210 --> 12:08.450
Facing the confidential department.

12:08.330 --> 12:17.540
[mistake]

12:11.350 --> 12:13.100
Yu Xiaoyue is just a chess piece.

12:14.220 --> 12:15.290
Although she was caught,

12:16.360 --> 12:17.650
We have nothing to lose.

12:18.150 --> 12:19.490
What's the next task?

12:19.620 --> 12:23.360
[mistake]

12:34.180 --> 12:36.420
Is it dangerous to keep moving?

12:36.790 --> 12:38.190
I've arranged everything.

12:39.110 --> 12:40.380
Someone will help you.

Otherwise they will doubt you.

Yeah, I'll pretend nothing happened

Mr. Shen is watching him.

38:56.900 --> 38:58.470
After coming out of the bathroom,

38:58.510 --> 38:59.300
He returned to the restaurant.

OK, thanks.

40:17.290 --> 40:18.420
What took you so long?

40:18.500 --> 40:19.440
I am anxious.

40:20.070 --> 40:20.820
how?

40:20.850 --> 40:21.800
Have you found him?

40:22.030 --> 40:22.620
No.

40:25.370 --> 40:26.260
Could it be

40:26.260 --> 40:27.540
Are you too sensitive?

40:27.620 --> 40:28.460
maybe that person

is part of the game.

impossible.

I guess

40:32.340 --> 40:33.300
This is indeed a spy mission.

40:34.540 --> 40:35.620
What do you mean?

40:36.580 --> 40:38.210
this game

40:38.230 --> 40:39.700
Completely controlled by spies.

40:41.150 --> 40:42.210
if this is true

40:42.500 --> 40:44.370
What we experienced abroad

40:44.670 --> 40:45.910
Also a spy.

40:46.950 --> 40:48.310
we got samples

40:48.560 --> 40:49.730
Does it mean we stole confidential information?

40:55.060 --> 40:56.160
No no no.

40:57.200 --> 40:58.140
The sample is broken

40:58.170 --> 40:59.860
Right in front of us.

41:00.030 --> 41:01.940
It can't be classified information.

41:02.920 --> 41:03.560
you're right.

41:04.650 --> 41:05.360
you're right.

41:06.850 --> 41:08.520
But there must be something wrong today.

41:10.160 --> 41:11.440
Did you copy the photo?

41:11.460 --> 41:13.210
Yes, I deleted them all.

41:18.320 --> 41:21.930
Then our mission failed.

41:22.180 --> 41:23.320
at this point,

41:23.340 --> 41:24.530
Are you still thinking about

41:27.630 --> 41:29.450
Can we continue this game?

41:29.840 --> 41:31.340
The question is, are you sure?

I...

No.

I'm just thinking

41:48.150 --> 41:49.690
perhaps

41:49.990 --> 41:51.570
Is this just a game arrangement?

Computer data theft.

41:56.150 --> 41:57.640
Remote hacking.

41:58.290 --> 42:00.570
If this were game design

42:01.070 --> 42:02.620
This game is too dangerous.

42:02.940 --> 42:04.220

certainly!

Much scarier than today.

42:27.390 --> 42:27.940
then,

42:27.940 --> 42:28.980
We didn't even give up.

I'm not scared at all.

But as you mentioned...

What should we do now?

Let's quit the game.

to clarify the matter.
