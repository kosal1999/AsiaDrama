03:12.120 --> 03:12.590
lecturer

03:13.080 --> 03:14.190
Any other questions today?

03:14.190 --> 03:14.630
nothing

03:15.430 --> 03:16.310
Then I'll go do other work first.

03:16.750 --> 03:17.150
let's go.

03:17.190 --> 03:17.560
able

03:25.680 --> 03:27.079
I'll start by looking at the sample library.

03:27.360 --> 03:28.360
Yes, this way.

03:39.590 --> 03:40.150
Why?

03:40.960 --> 03:41.590
that woman

03:53.710 --> 03:54.750
This person is Dr. Pianchi.

03:55.120 --> 03:56.190
B13 project leader

04:00.870 --> 04:01.310
Passed by just now

04:01.520 --> 04:02.430
Who is that woman?

04:03.120 --> 04:04.000
Dr. Pianchi's Assistant

04:04.120 --> 04:04.910
My name is Yu Xiaoyue.

04:21.240 --> 04:22.190
This path is the sample library.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.120
every time i collect and save

04:24.510 --> 04:25.750
will be saved on this computer.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.190
Stone, come and take a look.

04:29.390 --> 04:30.240
Example of B13

04:30.600 --> 04:32.000
Stored in this liquid nitrogen tank.

04:32.870 --> 04:33.360
And there are

04:33.360 --> 04:34.190
CCTV cameras 24 hours a day

04:34.720 --> 04:35.750
So this situation is impossible to happen.

04:35.750 --> 04:37.310
Missing examples

05:07.270 --> 05:07.750
B13

05:07.750 --> 05:08.800
Today is five minutes after midnight.

05:08.950 --> 05:09.920
I went into the warehouse once.

05:11.390 --> 05:13.040
B13 The last result came out today.

05:15.920 --> 05:17.040
ten minutes ago

05:19.630 --> 05:20.950
Where can I view CCTV cameras?

05:21.240 --> 05:22.190
You can look at it this way.

05:22.920 --> 05:23.560
Please come this way.

05:27.680 --> 05:28.160
look.

05:51.630 --> 05:52.310
Examples like this

05:52.560 --> 05:53.360
In the laboratory

05:53.430 --> 05:54.360
After the division is completed

05:54.750 --> 05:55.750
Gradually sent to sample warehouse

05:55.800 --> 05:56.360
Let's freeze it.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.120
Look at this bottle of liquid nitrogen.

05:58.680 --> 05:59.750
its temperature

05:59.870 --> 06:00.680
minus 160 degrees

06:00.720 --> 06:01.360
to 170 degrees

06:01.600 --> 06:02.680
for long term preservation

06:07.270 --> 06:08.240
Is there CCTV in the lab?

06:09.120 --> 06:09.630
have.

06:10.430 --> 06:11.120
Can you see this?

06:11.680 --> 06:12.310
can be seen

06:13.630 --> 06:14.240
But the experimental process

06:14.310 --> 06:15.510
involves high confidentiality

06:15.830 --> 06:16.560
Must be handed over to the president of the company

06:16.750 --> 06:17.430
Approval is correct.

06:18.800 --> 06:19.560
if you want to see

06:20.120 --> 06:21.190
I can refer the matter to you immediately.

06:21.750 --> 06:22.480
Then I'll trouble you.

06:22.950 --> 06:23.680
It doesn't matter

06:53.510 --> 06:53.950
stop

06:54.870 --> 06:55.480
Stand back a little.

06:57.870 --> 06:58.480
enlarge it

07:06.510 --> 07:07.390
You look at her hands.

07:07.720 --> 07:08.510
Except for straws

07:08.510 --> 07:09.630
It seems like there is something else.

07:11.310 --> 07:12.830
It looks like a needle.

07:16.190 --> 07:16.870
next place

07:21.750 --> 07:22.240
stop

07:24.070 --> 07:24.920
Look at that posture.

07:25.920 --> 07:26.560
Just like putting it in a bag.

07:26.600 --> 07:27.510
put something on

07:27.510 --> 07:27.920
Yes

07:31.000 --> 07:31.870
this woman

07:33.270 --> 07:34.560
Hurry and find out where she is.

07:35.310 --> 07:35.830
You can find it here.

07:35.870 --> 07:36.950
Can CCTV cameras be used in public areas?

07:37.360 --> 07:38.070
Can't see it here

07:38.270 --> 07:39.000
I brought it to you

07:39.070 --> 07:40.120
Go to the public CCTV room.

07:40.720 --> 07:42.240
That's right, when leaving the lobby.

07:42.310 --> 07:43.310
She had to pass a security check.

07:43.830 --> 07:45.159
Da Liu, you went to the security check.

07:45.600 --> 07:46.270
goodbye

07:46.630 --> 07:47.720
Mainly checked her bag.

07:47.920 --> 07:48.560
And things to take with you.

07:48.560 --> 07:48.950
Yes

07:49.159 --> 07:50.560
Shitou went to the CCTV room.

07:50.950 --> 07:51.480
able

07:51.750 --> 07:52.310
follow me.

08:39.480 --> 08:40.080
did you find it?

08:40.510 --> 08:41.600
She comes out of the lab.

08:41.789 --> 08:42.960
Go to the bathroom first.

08:43.360 --> 08:44.480
Then he went to the locker room.

09:01.150 --> 09:01.750
daliu daliu

09:02.240 --> 09:03.030
Where did the target go?

09:03.750 --> 09:04.960
West side of the institute

09:21.550 --> 09:22.080
Big Liu

09:22.670 --> 09:23.600
What is Yu Xiaoyue doing?

09:34.670 --> 09:36.120
Yu Xiaoyue sat down and packed her things.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.440
She threw the sample out the window.

09:42.630 --> 09:43.720
This is to avoid security checks.

09:44.150 --> 09:45.120
What should I do now?

09:47.960 --> 09:48.750
Haven't caught it yet.

09:49.360 --> 09:49.840
Still not sure

09:49.840 --> 09:51.030
Is she a professor?

09:51.200 --> 09:52.080
Look who she's dealing with.

09:52.670 --> 09:53.960
Now ready to leave the academy.

09:54.440 --> 09:54.840
do you understand?

09:54.910 --> 09:55.360
Keep an eye on her.

09:55.840 --> 09:56.510
admit

09:58.150 --> 09:58.720
Hello

09:59.720 --> 10:00.480
I'm going out.

10:00.630 --> 10:01.870
Okay, I see you now.

10:19.080 --> 10:19.960
The goal of online booking

10:20.150 --> 10:21.670
Vehicle registration DC0513

10:36.240 --> 10:36.720
boss

10:37.080 --> 10:38.200
Hello, a bag of ice.

10:39.750 --> 10:40.510
Hello, two yuan, five yuan.

10:57.550 --> 10:58.320
you do not say.

10:59.120 --> 11:00.200
Equipment for this game

11:00.200 --> 11:01.120
You can do it very seriously.

11:02.150 --> 11:02.960
Examples of some organisms

11:03.150 --> 11:04.030
during shipping

11:04.240 --> 11:05.360
The temperature must be kept very low.

11:06.480 --> 11:07.600
Do you still know about biology?

11:08.440 --> 11:09.320
I know a little bit.

11:10.030 --> 11:11.550
Now the more I count the days, the more I believe

11:11.630 --> 11:12.510
What we hold is

11:12.510 --> 11:13.390
Examples of real creatures

11:14.150 --> 11:15.150
It can be used here, Huang Dayang.

11:15.440 --> 11:16.480
You get so deeply invested in this character.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.550
this game

11:18.750 --> 11:20.080
The further back I went, the more excited I became.

11:20.240 --> 11:21.670
Need I say more?

11:23.840 --> 11:25.510
By the way, where is the pick-up location?

11:31.480 --> 11:33.320
Go to Waterfront Park

11:33.720 --> 11:34.600
suspect's destination

11:34.720 --> 11:35.550
This is a seaside park.

11:36.150 --> 11:37.120
The technical department is ready.

11:37.910 --> 11:39.270
She might be able to get the job done there.

11:39.750 --> 11:40.630
It has passed.

11:41.120 --> 11:42.320
Do you know the basics?

11:43.240 --> 11:43.790
Yu Xiaoyue

11:44.200 --> 11:45.750
Gimhae University College of Biomedicine

11:45.840 --> 11:46.720
Yanshan students

11:47.240 --> 11:48.600
Dr. Byun, laboratory leader

11:48.720 --> 11:49.600
become her advisor

11:50.080 --> 11:51.150
Yu Xiaoyue, at the beginning of this year

11:51.240 --> 11:52.550
Go to the laboratory to practice

11:52.870 --> 11:53.750
also

11:53.840 --> 11:54.720
She also has another side job.

11:55.150 --> 11:56.480
a little famous person

11:56.510 --> 11:57.360
relatively reputable

11:57.790 --> 11:58.840
Because the face is not bad

11:59.150 --> 11:59.910
usually do

11:59.960 --> 12:01.200
Simple popular science video

12:02.000 --> 12:02.630
Online fan club

12:02.720 --> 12:03.720
Already almost half a million

12:05.390 --> 12:06.270
What is your current occupation?

12:06.390 --> 12:07.270
You can also become an internet idol.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.840
Of course, it’s okay to eat loudly.

13:08.960 --> 13:10.230
The pony followed her.

13:32.150 --> 13:33.670
Another one, another one, go, go.

13:40.790 --> 13:41.550
Someone went in.

13:44.360 --> 13:45.510
stop stop stop

13:47.600 --> 13:48.390
What’s wrong with you?

13:49.960 --> 13:50.960
How did he get here?

13:51.840 --> 13:52.670
do you know?

13:54.390 --> 13:55.030
my brother

14:00.440 --> 14:01.030
is it here?

14:01.390 --> 14:02.000
here

14:08.750 --> 14:09.360
let's go.

14:09.840 --> 14:11.150
Not you, what are you doing?

14:11.240 --> 14:11.960
What are you doing?

14:12.030 --> 14:12.840
Can't you act in a drama?

14:13.270 --> 14:14.510
In the world of spies

14:14.750 --> 14:15.960
Must always have access to this role

14:16.720 --> 14:17.600
access role

14:40.670 --> 14:41.670
don't don't don't don't

14:42.550 --> 14:43.480
Absolutely not.

14:49.870 --> 14:50.720
What are you doing?

14:51.790 --> 14:52.390
That is,

14:52.790 --> 14:54.080
Put it on me first

14:54.150 --> 14:54.510
Why

14:54.550 --> 14:55.750
Are you still afraid that I will run away?

14:56.750 --> 14:57.960
who knows?

14:58.550 --> 14:59.120
in spy games

14:59.320 --> 15:00.440
I'm famous too

15:01.030 --> 15:01.840
I'll go investigate.

15:02.440 --> 15:03.440
You have a bad reputation.

15:03.790 --> 15:04.790
These are all rumors.

15:04.790 --> 15:06.030
Clearly jealous

15:08.630 --> 15:10.200
I only believe in my own decisions.

15:13.510 --> 15:14.960
Keep 4 degrees

15:15.550 --> 15:16.360
sorry.

15:16.840 --> 15:17.960
This thermos cup

15:18.000 --> 15:18.910
It's still in my bag.

15:19.510 --> 15:21.240
By the way, give me a drink.

15:21.510 --> 15:22.840
Assume I know the game.

15:22.840 --> 15:23.910
Why design a companion?

15:25.030 --> 15:26.080
You already knew that, right?

15:26.320 --> 15:27.440
This is to warn you.

15:27.550 --> 15:29.320
Don't always be complacent.

15:29.670 --> 15:30.360
Who knows what your partner will be?

15:30.510 --> 15:31.240
get away

15:31.240 --> 15:31.960
When did you start running away?

15:32.440 --> 15:33.390
In the world of spies

15:33.790 --> 15:35.240
can't trust anyone

15:37.030 --> 15:38.080
Even the people around you

15:38.320 --> 15:39.550
You must always be careful.

15:47.840 --> 15:49.630
The next station is

15:50.550 --> 15:51.440
Bangkok

15:52.670 --> 15:53.270
suppose i know

15:53.320 --> 15:54.000
Task prompt time

15:54.030 --> 15:54.320
Why

15:54.320 --> 15:55.390
Please bring your bag and passport with you.

15:56.150 --> 15:57.670
It looks like it was designed a long time ago.

16:00.320 --> 16:00.790
let's go.

16:01.390 --> 16:02.270
We went to the airport.

16:03.550 --> 16:04.390
this game

16:05.270 --> 16:06.150
something

16:07.200 --> 16:08.510
You don't have to worry this time, right?

16:09.000 --> 16:11.080
Now the two of us are inseparable.

16:12.000 --> 16:12.550
let's go.

16:30.000 --> 16:30.960
Samples have been collected.

16:31.600 --> 16:32.320
Targeting

16:32.870 --> 16:33.550
One man and one woman

16:34.390 --> 16:35.390
A 28-year-old man was sitting in the car.

16:35.910 --> 16:37.000
Put on a white coat

16:37.480 --> 16:38.480
Black double bag

16:39.150 --> 16:40.120
Height approx. 180 cm

16:40.480 --> 16:42.030
His name is Huang Zicheng, I know.

16:42.790 --> 16:43.910
I don't know the woman's identity.

16:44.630 --> 16:45.960
It's up to me to follow up on the rest.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.240
I'd like some advice.

16:53.360 --> 16:54.000
What are you doing?

16:54.080 --> 16:55.030
I've thought about it.

16:55.270 --> 16:55.840
is that so?

16:56.030 --> 16:57.200
Must be kept at 4 degrees.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.000
Otherwise, place in a heatproof cup first.

16:59.510 --> 17:00.200
Don't do it because of this

17:00.270 --> 17:01.240
mission failed.

17:02.270 --> 17:03.550
Then you get me a thermos cup.

17:13.880 --> 17:14.920
Have you read and understood what it is?

17:14.920 --> 17:15.550
Take a look too.

17:15.960 --> 17:17.480
Quality blurred, layered

17:17.790 --> 17:18.720
Must remain below center

17:19.030 --> 17:20.310
From the knowledge I gathered

17:21.270 --> 17:22.880
This could be some kind of experimental medicine.

17:24.240 --> 17:25.440
And you do know this.

17:25.640 --> 17:26.400
affim

17:26.589 --> 17:27.829
Someone in our family does this.

17:28.109 --> 17:28.830
seen it myself

17:30.160 --> 17:30.920
but

17:32.070 --> 17:34.110
Even if this is a real example

17:34.110 --> 17:35.310
this is normal.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.590
It can be seen that the task positioning is very strict.

17:38.920 --> 17:39.920
that's right.

17:41.440 --> 17:42.270
But why am I still

17:42.270 --> 17:43.200
a little excited

17:44.400 --> 17:45.590
you are like this

17:45.920 --> 17:47.240
Are you still playing offline missions?

17:49.000 --> 17:50.750
I'm careful, aren't I?

17:51.550 --> 17:52.590
I get it, I totally get it.

17:52.680 --> 17:53.640
That's your type

17:53.790 --> 17:55.310
Dare to speak and act in the game

17:55.480 --> 17:57.070
When it comes to your life, you're already wandering.

17:57.270 --> 17:58.270
who who who

17:58.400 --> 17:59.270
Who, who, I understand.

17:59.350 --> 17:59.920
I get it, I totally get it.

17:59.920 --> 18:01.200
There are no letters in my dictionary\215;

18:01.310 --> 18:01.790
I see

18:02.030 --> 18:03.480
So I'm not worried about you being scared.

18:03.640 --> 18:04.240
Please hurry up.

18:09.350 --> 18:10.200
Yaoyao, woman

18:10.230 --> 18:11.200
25 years old, from Jinhai

18:11.350 --> 18:12.240
Have study abroad background

18:12.440 --> 18:13.270
At the end of last year, I returned to China.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.110
It happened many times during this period.

18:14.240 --> 18:15.000
Immigration records

18:15.200 --> 18:16.110
Set aside two goals.

18:16.240 --> 18:17.000
It's half past six tonight.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Flight tickets to Bangkok

18:20.550 --> 18:21.590
Huang Zichengnan

18:21.830 --> 18:23.240
28 years old, from Jinhai

18:23.640 --> 18:24.240
Kimhae University

18:24.270 --> 18:25.550
Data Engineering Academy Online

18:25.550 --> 18:26.270
Graduate with a bachelor's degree

18:26.640 --> 18:27.510
There is currently no job agency.

18:27.680 --> 18:28.350
best in game

18:28.790 --> 18:30.310
When I was in college, I used to put together a team.

18:30.440 --> 18:31.070
Participate in the competition

18:31.270 --> 18:32.400
international gaming competition

18:32.590 --> 18:33.310
and gain military rank

18:33.790 --> 18:34.350
many years ago

18:34.350 --> 18:35.440
There are multiple entries and exits recorded.

18:35.720 --> 18:36.790
Gao Tianyang's younger brother.

18:38.680 --> 18:39.270
Director Qin

18:40.030 --> 18:41.160
should i avoid

18:41.640 --> 18:42.350
Emergency situations

18:42.440 --> 18:43.680
You continue this mission.

18:43.960 --> 18:44.750
You should know

18:45.000 --> 18:46.160
in the face of national interests

18:46.550 --> 18:47.750
Keep your personal feelings to yourself.

18:48.240 --> 18:49.550
If Huang Zicheng goes abroad

18:50.110 --> 18:50.960
Will you be quarantined?

18:51.310 --> 18:51.750
I will send

18:51.790 --> 18:52.790
agency inspector

18:52.830 --> 18:53.310
go to airport

18:53.830 --> 18:55.070
When you are sure the sample is authentic

18:55.400 --> 18:56.030
Quarantine immediately

18:56.680 --> 18:57.160
I see.

20:17.110 --> 20:18.550
Please check it for me.

20:18.720 --> 20:19.960
Is this an example of B13?

20:20.200 --> 20:21.160
Ok, no problem.

20:21.960 --> 20:22.720
I gotta go

20:37.880 --> 20:38.350
Are you OK

20:38.960 --> 20:40.000
Ordinary honey

20:45.480 --> 20:46.070
You're already in trouble.

20:46.160 --> 20:46.720
It doesn't matter

20:52.070 --> 20:53.240
Fortunately the sample is fake.

20:55.440 --> 20:56.160
if it is like this

20:56.590 --> 20:57.960
We have to hurry up.

20:59.000 --> 20:59.830
real example

21:00.350 --> 21:01.310
has changed

21:02.200 --> 21:03.310
I would like to know

21:04.480 --> 21:05.160
two of them are

21:05.350 --> 21:07.000
Gamers who complete special tasks

21:09.720 --> 21:10.640
Huang Zicheng

21:12.400 --> 21:13.160
really like playing games

21:15.790 --> 21:16.480
if he is

21:16.680 --> 21:18.270
Gamers who were actually chosen by spies

21:19.310 --> 21:20.790
If the spies still plan to use him

21:21.480 --> 21:22.640
He is safe now.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.000
don’t worry.

21:27.830 --> 21:29.030
Our top priority now

21:29.480 --> 21:30.880
That is, take missing samples.

21:32.880 --> 21:34.350
Yu Xiaoyue left the institute.

21:34.830 --> 21:36.110
always in our sight

21:36.790 --> 21:38.310
If anyone wants to change the sample

21:38.830 --> 21:39.480
Probably

21:39.480 --> 21:40.960
Before Xiao Yue left the institute

21:41.920 --> 21:43.200
I sent someone to check.

21:44.270 --> 21:45.030
I'm thinking

21:46.110 --> 21:47.000
This is Yu Xiaoyue

21:47.160 --> 21:48.640
Is she a professor?

21:54.550 --> 21:55.200
Hello

21:56.240 --> 21:56.720
Gaoke

21:57.200 --> 21:58.160
I checked the security cameras.

21:58.350 --> 21:59.110
Yu Xiaoyue confirmed

21:59.200 --> 22:00.480
After leaving the sample

22:00.720 --> 22:02.750
A cleaning crew has arrived at the scene.

22:22.680 --> 22:23.750
Cleaning staff

22:26.430 --> 22:27.310
Have you checked the shift schedule?

22:27.720 --> 22:28.480
Verified

22:28.830 --> 22:29.920
Let your real estate company schedule a cleaning today.

22:29.920 --> 22:30.640
There are no men.

22:32.480 --> 22:33.350
Where did he leave?

22:34.270 --> 22:35.960
Come out the back door.

22:38.680 --> 22:39.880
There are no security cameras outside.

22:40.590 --> 22:41.550
I have contacted the technical department.

22:41.640 --> 22:43.030
Ask them to check the CCTV cameras on the streets.

22:44.200 --> 22:44.750
Yes

22:47.070 --> 22:47.680
Thanks

22:52.720 --> 22:53.480
Tian Yang, here I come.

22:54.070 --> 22:54.590
OK

22:58.270 --> 22:59.310
He walked straight across the road.

23:08.480 --> 23:09.000
admit

23:18.350 --> 23:19.310
Continue walking straight.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.590
There is a cold chain truck parked on the roadside.

23:25.920 --> 23:26.880
Just like you're taking a photo.

23:29.030 --> 23:30.310
The subject walks past a refrigerated truck.

23:32.030 --> 23:33.070
From the perspective of CCTV

23:33.070 --> 23:33.880
I will never see him again.

23:53.590 --> 23:54.960
After passing the refrigerated truck

23:55.750 --> 23:57.480
The target appears from behind the car again.

23:59.310 --> 24:00.160
impossible

24:01.550 --> 24:02.880
We walk at a normal pace.

24:03.070 --> 24:03.680
He has no choice

24:03.680 --> 24:04.510
This is too slow.

24:06.070 --> 24:07.160
Unless you stop halfway.

24:10.400 --> 24:11.480
according to his speed

24:11.480 --> 24:12.720
Only a few seconds slower than us.

24:14.160 --> 24:15.200
It may be too late.

24:17.480 --> 24:18.160
But he has enough time.

24:18.350 --> 24:19.790
Go around the back of the car and lower the trailer.

24:26.240 --> 24:27.550
It may well have been delivered.

24:28.880 --> 24:29.350
But the CCTV cameras here

24:29.550 --> 24:30.720
It's not okay to take pictures like this

24:37.160 --> 24:37.960
Find a way to check it out.

24:38.030 --> 24:38.960
CCTV camera of normal shop next door

24:39.720 --> 24:40.830
And this cool truck.

24:41.000 --> 24:41.510
Must be fast

24:41.920 --> 24:42.440
admit

24:52.960 --> 24:53.750
He continued speaking straightly.

24:55.070 --> 24:55.590
he went in

24:55.590 --> 24:56.720
The underground shopping mall next door

25:00.030 --> 25:01.270
The goal is lost here.

25:02.440 --> 25:03.160
No security cameras?

25:03.480 --> 25:04.590
He was not visible on CCTV cameras.

25:05.590 --> 25:06.640
It seems he has been planning this for a long time.

25:06.680 --> 25:07.550
This road has been missing for a long time.

25:08.510 --> 25:09.030
The clue disappeared.

25:09.030 --> 25:09.550
All we can do is wait.

25:09.550 --> 25:10.480
Results from the CCTV cameras there.

25:13.590 --> 25:14.270
Yu Xiaoyue?

25:20.000 --> 25:20.790
close to you

25:21.200 --> 25:22.590
Japanese restaurant called "The Fisherman"

25:39.960 --> 25:41.160
She said, Yu Xiaoyue, do you know?

25:41.310 --> 25:42.480
The sample she stole had been replaced.

25:44.350 --> 25:44.920
have no idea

25:45.680 --> 25:46.200
she may

25:46.200 --> 25:47.510
This is one of the professor's works.

25:49.790 --> 25:51.200
Then we have to be more careful.

25:59.400 --> 26:00.000
go to eat

26:01.310 --> 26:01.880
Is it Japanese food?

26:03.030 --> 26:03.640
I lift it myself

26:04.510 --> 26:05.350
for work

26:07.830 --> 26:08.510
welcome

26:09.270 --> 26:09.880
Two people?

26:10.000 --> 26:10.480
Yes

26:10.550 --> 26:11.070
This way

26:13.880 --> 26:14.480
staff

26:14.720 --> 26:15.310
Thanks

26:16.440 --> 26:17.310
Hold on

26:20.310 --> 26:21.110
I

26:22.350 --> 26:23.070
welcome

26:23.720 --> 26:24.680
What do you two want to eat?

26:26.550 --> 26:28.240
Our tuna is a label.

26:31.270 --> 26:31.960
You come.

26:33.750 --> 26:34.830
We ate very easily.

26:35.030 --> 26:35.510
Yes

26:38.720 --> 26:40.030
Order the tuna salad.

26:46.110 --> 26:47.510
Please give me some beef rice.

26:52.510 --> 26:53.480
Hello

27:00.440 --> 27:02.240
I got another order of fried chicken.

27:02.350 --> 27:03.960
and Japanese cold noodles

27:06.400 --> 27:06.960
Is it enough?

27:08.480 --> 27:09.110
enough

27:10.000 --> 27:10.400
OK

27:11.160 --> 27:12.110
Wait a moment, it's almost done.

27:12.110 --> 27:12.590
Thanks

27:16.480 --> 27:17.200
I'll go to the bathroom first.

27:17.510 --> 27:17.880
Yes

27:34.680 --> 27:36.310
The employee asked for another drink.

27:36.960 --> 27:37.480
Yes

27:43.720 --> 27:45.030
Do you think those two friends of yours

27:45.590 --> 27:46.550
Are you OK?

27:47.070 --> 27:48.680
School sweethearts become colleagues

27:49.720 --> 27:51.400
Men care deeply about women.

27:54.310 --> 27:55.960
Too much attention is never a good thing.

27:57.400 --> 27:58.160
Why?

28:01.110 --> 28:02.440
Thanks

28:03.480 --> 28:04.110
Are you satisfied?

28:04.400 --> 28:05.160
Not bad at all

28:05.750 --> 28:07.160
If you like it, fine, enjoy it.

28:07.590 --> 28:09.000
If you need anything please feel free to give me a call.

28:09.440 --> 28:09.920
This boss

28:09.920 --> 28:11.160
Serve us personally.

28:11.550 --> 28:13.350
Customers are very busy today.

28:13.720 --> 28:15.270
Then I wish you a prosperous business.

28:15.640 --> 28:16.270
Thanks

28:17.200 --> 28:17.830
It's already difficult.

28:25.400 --> 28:27.000
You also follow your friends.

28:27.440 --> 28:28.750
Don't just look at the boss.

28:30.310 --> 28:32.240
Boss Nian is really kind-hearted.

28:33.510 --> 28:34.070
Can I ask for your attention?

28:34.270 --> 28:35.680
It usually unfolds like this.

28:36.720 --> 28:37.400
So at work

28:37.590 --> 28:38.790
I will never miss it.

28:40.200 --> 28:41.750
I know what's going on in your mind.

28:42.440 --> 28:44.070
Don't let me touch your little tail.

28:45.830 --> 28:46.880
Am I really that callous?

28:49.550 --> 28:50.680
You are not mentally ill.

28:51.200 --> 28:52.110
That's your pride.

28:53.350 --> 28:54.160
but now

28:54.270 --> 28:55.200
It has developed a lot.

28:58.240 --> 28:58.880
You probably won't.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.400
Do you still want revenge?

29:02.830 --> 29:04.200
How could I be so narrow-minded?

29:10.400 --> 29:11.000
actually

29:11.350 --> 29:12.750
work with you

29:13.200 --> 29:13.920
That's very good.

29:14.640 --> 29:15.480
life cannot

29:16.070 --> 29:16.880
It's a bit inconsistent

29:50.440 --> 29:51.550
Your friend has been found.

29:52.350 --> 29:53.030
You hurry up and eat.

29:53.160 --> 29:53.880
So you ordered everything?

29:53.960 --> 29:54.510
Don't waste it.

29:54.960 --> 29:55.830
I'll pay

30:11.200 --> 30:12.350
Do you still find traces of the car?

30:15.160 --> 30:15.830
I gotta go

30:17.200 --> 30:18.110
Send me the car registration certificate.

31:26.720 --> 31:27.350
It's him

31:45.160 --> 31:45.880
This is it.

31:56.590 --> 31:57.550
Do you know this person?

31:58.000 --> 31:59.480
I definitely know it’s Boss Han.

31:59.790 --> 32:00.750
He is the boss of the Red Snapper King.

32:01.160 --> 32:01.720
boss

32:02.270 --> 32:02.720
Yes

32:03.640 --> 32:04.920
His family is the Tuna family.

32:05.270 --> 32:05.830
Honourable

32:06.030 --> 32:07.030
It is located on the road north of the market.

32:07.200 --> 32:08.030
It's not far away, we are there.

32:18.110 --> 32:19.350
So the warehouse belongs to him?

32:19.750 --> 32:21.070
No, this is a rental.

32:21.720 --> 32:22.310
Trucks and warehouses

32:22.350 --> 32:23.110
They are all home rental services.

32:23.160 --> 32:24.310
Provide rental services

32:34.640 --> 32:35.590
The owner delivers the goods himself.

32:36.240 --> 32:37.480
The boss is really attentive.

32:41.030 --> 32:42.350
Samples must be kept at low temperatures.

32:43.240 --> 32:44.240
Items may be hidden.

32:44.270 --> 32:45.920
Put it in the box of merchandise he sent back to the warehouse.

32:46.200 --> 32:47.000
Difficulty entering the position

32:48.030 --> 32:48.750
I have a method.

32:49.030 --> 32:49.960
Do not cut grass to scare snakes.

32:50.070 --> 32:50.680
affim

32:55.830 --> 32:56.400
Already have this

33:22.400 --> 33:23.000
boss

33:24.270 --> 33:24.750
Hello you both.

33:24.790 --> 33:25.830
please disturb me please disturb me

33:26.680 --> 33:27.790
Look at this fish.

33:32.270 --> 33:33.240
Do you two want anything?

33:36.000 --> 33:36.590
Both of us

33:36.750 --> 33:38.110
from zhouzhouzhou

33:38.240 --> 33:39.510
I want to open a fresh food supermarket.

33:39.590 --> 33:41.400
Open your own fresh food supermarket

33:42.000 --> 33:43.350
I spent a whole day shopping here today.

33:43.720 --> 33:45.240
I want to find a reliable supplier.

33:45.240 --> 33:46.440
tuna suppliers

33:47.000 --> 33:47.750
Come and have a look.

33:48.550 --> 33:50.030
Want to start your own small business

33:50.270 --> 33:50.960
Yes Yes

33:51.310 --> 33:52.440
So if you are looking for tuna

33:52.680 --> 33:53.680
You've come to the right place.

33:53.880 --> 33:54.790
I

33:55.000 --> 33:55.680
well educated

33:55.830 --> 33:56.400
Really?

33:56.920 --> 33:57.720
look.

33:59.920 --> 34:00.790
This is awesome.

34:01.310 --> 34:02.230
Are you all fishermen?

34:04.000 --> 34:04.710
not all

34:06.030 --> 34:07.510
There are fishing enthusiasts in every country.

34:07.710 --> 34:08.590
They are all very noble.

34:08.590 --> 34:09.280
fishing technician

34:10.030 --> 34:11.760
Then you are still a person who likes fishing.

34:13.110 --> 34:13.760
It can't be called a hobby.

34:13.960 --> 34:15.360
I can say that I am fishing in the sea.

34:15.920 --> 34:16.550
crazy people

34:16.920 --> 34:17.550
you can see.

34:18.920 --> 34:20.360
And Jinhai has

34:20.670 --> 34:21.760
How about a fishing club?

34:22.230 --> 34:22.960
there must be

34:23.510 --> 34:24.630
I am a club member

34:25.070 --> 34:25.880
Are you interested?

34:25.920 --> 34:26.840
Welcome all friends to join us.

34:26.960 --> 34:27.880
That's good.

34:28.070 --> 34:28.670
I haven't introduced myself yet.

34:28.800 --> 34:29.550
My name is Han Jie.

34:29.670 --> 34:30.440
The owner of this store

34:31.030 --> 34:31.840
Hello, Tao Kaihan.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.070
Hello

34:33.670 --> 34:35.360
our fish

34:35.710 --> 34:36.590
It's all here, right?

34:36.800 --> 34:38.360
Impossible, can't let go

34:38.590 --> 34:39.840
We have a dedicated cold room behind us.

34:40.070 --> 34:41.400
Because it must have a specific temperature.

34:41.550 --> 34:42.510
save these tuna

34:43.440 --> 34:44.440
So is it convenient for you?

34:44.590 --> 34:45.480
Can we go and have a look?

34:47.190 --> 34:47.920
Now?

34:49.670 --> 34:50.510
Isn't it very convenient?

34:52.920 --> 34:53.550
This is not inconvenient.

34:53.550 --> 34:55.110
But not for too long.

34:55.190 --> 34:55.840
because of this fish

34:55.840 --> 34:56.400
I see.

34:57.320 --> 34:58.070
Yes Yes.

34:58.510 --> 34:59.000
So I'm interrupting you.

34:59.000 --> 34:59.510
Yes, let's go.

34:59.510 --> 35:00.110
Come on, follow me.

35:00.280 --> 35:00.960
OK, let’s go.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.150
The temperature inside is quite low.

35:14.880 --> 35:15.440
Come on.

35:16.590 --> 35:17.800
It's a bit cold inside.

35:19.440 --> 35:20.280
lying on the floor

35:20.630 --> 35:22.030
It is imported from various sources.

35:22.110 --> 35:22.760
blue stingray gold spear

35:23.110 --> 35:24.760
Most are Australian snails.

35:24.840 --> 35:25.800
And blue stingrays.

35:26.110 --> 35:26.590
Of course there is.

35:26.630 --> 35:27.320
golden marlin

35:27.840 --> 35:28.960
Stingray Golden Spear Price

35:28.960 --> 35:29.550
will be quite high

35:29.550 --> 35:31.030
There are many choices in the domestic market.

35:31.280 --> 35:32.440
It mainly depends on your needs.

35:33.590 --> 35:34.320
It's the same with humans.

35:34.510 --> 35:35.280
Rely on one's own strength

35:35.400 --> 35:36.110
Take the Golden Spear from the Blue Stingray.

35:36.230 --> 35:37.110
Eat until it's dangerous.

35:37.360 --> 35:37.800
no way.

35:37.840 --> 35:38.880
There is demand in this market.

35:39.440 --> 35:39.960
how?

35:39.960 --> 35:41.230
In the eyes of most customers

35:41.230 --> 35:42.320
This golden gun, this blue gun.

35:42.510 --> 35:43.110
Fresh

35:43.320 --> 35:44.670
it reflects

35:44.710 --> 35:45.840
High level Japanese food

35:46.280 --> 35:47.030
this is correct.

35:47.440 --> 35:48.550
Do we have fresh fish?

35:49.070 --> 35:50.190
Yes, this is the way to go.

35:53.550 --> 35:54.280
then we

35:54.320 --> 35:55.360
will be sent to

35:55.440 --> 35:56.760
including degree of freshness

35:56.840 --> 35:57.760
Can I guarantee this?

35:58.000 --> 35:58.590
This is something you can count on.

35:58.710 --> 35:59.670
We are all degrees zero to four.

35:59.670 --> 36:00.440
Keep ice fresh

36:00.510 --> 36:01.360
After the product arrives

36:01.400 --> 36:02.710
Will find an expert immediately

36:02.800 --> 36:04.070
Cold chain logistics delivery is everywhere.

36:04.230 --> 36:05.880
If you are in Zhuzhou

36:06.150 --> 36:07.670
You will receive fish that morning.

36:07.880 --> 36:09.190
In fact, I have many Southeast Asian customers.

36:09.360 --> 36:10.480
That day they received fish.

36:10.960 --> 36:11.510
your customer

36:11.510 --> 36:12.840
It's everywhere indeed.

36:13.030 --> 36:13.670
superb

36:14.400 --> 36:16.070
Then this kind of thing bothers you.

36:16.230 --> 36:17.670
The two of us went back and discussed it together.

36:17.710 --> 36:19.590
and contact you later

36:19.800 --> 36:20.440
Ok, no problem

36:20.960 --> 36:22.190
Do you have a business card?

36:22.670 --> 36:24.630
Yeah, yeah, look at my brain.

36:26.070 --> 36:26.750
Ma Hengjie

36:28.230 --> 36:28.670
Han Lu

36:28.670 --> 36:29.510
thanks, thanks.

36:30.320 --> 36:30.920
sorry.

36:31.030 --> 36:32.480
All I have is this electronic business card.

36:32.480 --> 36:32.960
able?

36:33.150 --> 36:33.880
No problem, no problem.

36:34.030 --> 36:34.510
you sent it to me

36:34.630 --> 36:35.400
So now I'm sending it to you.

36:42.150 --> 36:42.960
Did you get it?

36:46.920 --> 36:47.590
Manager Wu

36:49.590 --> 36:50.360
Ok, no problem

36:50.760 --> 36:51.880
Come on, I'll take you there first.

36:51.920 --> 36:53.110
Very cold, very cold.

36:53.360 --> 36:53.840
go! go! go

36:53.840 --> 36:54.360
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

36:54.360 --> 36:55.110
Come on, come over here.

37:04.960 --> 37:06.070
All boxes are the same.

37:06.320 --> 37:07.510
It's hard to tell where to put it.

37:09.670 --> 37:11.230
You know tuna.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.280
we create information

37:13.360 --> 37:14.510
I have seen quite a lot of the world.

37:14.510 --> 37:15.110
this is normal.

37:15.840 --> 37:17.150
distract you like me

37:17.230 --> 37:18.190
Is it still useful?

37:19.800 --> 37:21.230
I searched my phone all the way.

37:22.150 --> 37:23.360
Learn it and sell it, right?

37:25.280 --> 37:27.230
This is the ability to memorize quickly.

37:30.800 --> 37:32.190
What do you think of Han Jie?

37:33.000 --> 37:33.630
He knows the profession very well.

37:33.800 --> 37:34.630
like a boss

37:35.280 --> 37:36.710
Look at your body and exercise regularly.

37:37.230 --> 37:38.960
Healthy complexion, probably going to the beach often.

37:39.550 --> 37:40.880
I like sea fishing.

37:41.030 --> 37:42.360
or surfing

37:42.760 --> 37:44.230
I couldn't tell his size at all.

37:44.320 --> 37:45.590
How does this relate to missing samples?

37:46.030 --> 37:46.510
there are some things

37:46.510 --> 37:47.670
Now I looked and there was nothing.

37:47.880 --> 37:48.670
I'm not sure what will happen next.

37:50.670 --> 37:51.880
Yes, there is a reason for this.

37:52.840 --> 37:53.630
What to do next?

37:55.880 --> 37:56.630
He is an example.

37:56.630 --> 37:57.710
This is probably the end.

37:58.670 --> 37:59.360
must pass

37:59.400 --> 38:00.550
Cold chain transportation channels

38:00.550 --> 38:01.360
send out

38:02.070 --> 38:02.670
fit

38:03.070 --> 38:03.760
It has everything here.

38:17.000 --> 38:17.590
Are you ready?

38:19.190 --> 38:20.670
Already paying attention to his phone.

38:23.230 --> 38:24.670
Please rest assured that the product will arrive tomorrow.

38:32.550 --> 38:34.190
Your electronic business card has done its job.

38:36.760 --> 38:37.590
I found out you took advantage of my people.

38:37.630 --> 38:38.630
Very smooth.

38:39.710 --> 38:40.760
Wait until tomorrow for him to send the package.

38:41.070 --> 38:41.710
we will

38:41.760 --> 38:42.590
Sample found

38:45.030 --> 38:46.670
Take a look at Hangyul's reception mode,

38:47.960 --> 38:49.440
It may have been seized by spies.

38:49.590 --> 38:50.440
a transportation line

38:51.510 --> 38:53.480
If we have sampled

38:53.480 --> 38:54.590
The other party did not receive the product.

38:55.150 --> 38:56.190
Then this line is useless.

38:58.630 --> 38:59.110
real

38:59.800 --> 39:00.480
Keep Han Jie.

39:00.590 --> 39:01.840
Will receive more information

39:02.480 --> 39:03.280
But we will give Hangyul

39:03.400 --> 39:04.440
Unable to send sample.

39:04.960 --> 39:06.030
They can use fake samples.

39:06.190 --> 39:07.150
You can lure us away.

39:07.800 --> 39:08.400
then we can

39:08.510 --> 39:09.670
You can give them something fake.

39:12.710 --> 39:13.190
Is there insurance?

39:13.760 --> 39:14.960
Of course, I can't wear eye drops.

39:15.000 --> 39:15.800
We can't lie to them anymore.

39:17.000 --> 39:17.590
best way for us

39:17.590 --> 39:18.710
people from institute

39:18.960 --> 39:19.400
Have a set

39:19.400 --> 39:20.880
Examples of their previous experiments

39:21.510 --> 39:23.030
Fake samples can be used as real samples.

39:23.800 --> 39:24.800
Just like this Korean line

39:25.030 --> 39:26.110
We will be able to follow up.

39:28.280 --> 39:28.840
or you

39:28.840 --> 39:29.670
Have you been planning this for a long time?

39:31.070 --> 39:32.440
This person's ideas have always been far-fetched.

39:32.880 --> 39:33.670
I never knew that before.

39:34.280 --> 39:35.150
Understandable

39:35.320 --> 39:36.280
Anyway, you

39:36.280 --> 39:37.230
Not very good at discovering

39:37.230 --> 39:38.150
the advantages of others

39:44.880 --> 39:46.360
This plan requires permission.

39:49.230 --> 39:50.070
There should still be time

40:10.000 --> 40:10.760
The project still exists.

40:24.590 --> 40:25.070
Let's continue.

40:26.280 --> 40:26.840
Let's go

40:31.150 --> 40:31.760
Where?

40:32.190 --> 40:33.440
Didn't say there was

40:33.630 --> 40:34.800
like a storage box

40:35.760 --> 40:36.880
Not here.

40:41.000 --> 40:41.590
Right here, right here, right here

40:47.190 --> 40:50.760
4944

40:51.480 --> 40:52.670
8888

40:54.800 --> 40:55.190
right here

41:00.230 --> 41:00.840
What's this?

41:04.480 --> 41:05.070
Hotel address

41:06.150 --> 41:06.630
key card

41:07.760 --> 41:08.360
Task cost

41:10.030 --> 41:10.630
let's go.

41:27.710 --> 41:28.230
right here

41:30.070 --> 41:30.630
Hello

41:30.800 --> 41:32.030
Hello, we are arranging your accommodation.

41:33.480 --> 41:34.030
Thanks

41:47.150 --> 41:47.510
Thanks

41:47.670 --> 41:48.230
Thank you, no problem.

42:00.480 --> 42:00.960
618

42:01.110 --> 42:01.400
Yes

42:02.000 --> 42:02.480
619

42:07.440 --> 42:07.880
Why?

42:08.070 --> 42:09.550
Do you want a drink?

42:11.070 --> 42:12.360
The mission is not over yet.

42:12.510 --> 42:13.670
There are new orders every time.

42:16.510 --> 42:18.590
Get some rest now and don't run around.

42:22.920 --> 42:23.760
Why is it different from what I imagined?

42:23.760 --> 42:24.710
Not the same
