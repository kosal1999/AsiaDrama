00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
[Professional subtitles are being translated. Will be updated soon]

01:40.229 --> 01:40.680
for you

01:43.560 --> 01:45.150
Hello everyone, hello everyone.

01:46.350 --> 01:46.759
Completed

01:46.920 --> 01:47.350
Arrived, arrived

01:47.430 --> 01:47.870
today

01:48.000 --> 01:49.150
I will let everyone

01:49.280 --> 01:50.280
little magic

01:50.560 --> 01:51.840
Draw with a group of bacteria

01:52.560 --> 01:53.229
here we go.

01:56.430 --> 01:58.280
This is a group of bacteria that I cultured.

01:59.280 --> 02:00.310
Let everyone take a look.

02:01.480 --> 02:02.150
Have you seen it?

02:03.120 --> 02:04.080
There is a little something.

02:04.680 --> 02:05.870
Hundreds of thousands of people watching

02:06.400 --> 02:07.520
As a science newscaster

02:07.960 --> 02:08.910
You can use this process.

02:09.680 --> 02:10.710
Magic wand

02:11.080 --> 02:11.590
just like you

02:11.630 --> 02:12.310
How much money can you make in a day?

02:12.520 --> 02:14.120
What changes next?

02:14.280 --> 02:15.150
Live broadcast, take it with you

02:15.240 --> 02:16.750
If you receive other ads

02:16.870 --> 02:18.470
Tens of thousands a month is no problem.

02:19.079 --> 02:21.120
This is easier than boiling it in the lab.

02:21.360 --> 02:22.150
Making money is much easier.

02:23.000 --> 02:23.910
Such a high income

02:24.430 --> 02:25.710
Why are you still stealing samples?

02:27.400 --> 02:27.840
a while.

02:27.870 --> 02:29.800
You will see magic.

02:33.030 --> 02:33.430
OK

02:34.870 --> 02:35.680
closed.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.680
Let's see the results.

02:39.630 --> 02:40.310
I'm so excited.

02:42.280 --> 02:43.560
The magic is coming.

02:46.590 --> 02:47.150
Are you OK

02:49.190 --> 02:49.910
Amazing, right?

02:54.710 --> 02:55.840
Admission notice has been announced.

02:56.120 --> 02:57.150
Thank you for your concern.

03:09.430 --> 03:10.120
sorry.

03:10.630 --> 03:12.150
At this time, the paper cannot be published.

03:13.150 --> 03:14.120
Please wait while I go to class.

03:14.710 --> 03:15.710
Everyone is waiting patiently.

03:18.360 --> 03:18.840
OK

03:19.120 --> 03:20.680
That’s enough for today’s live broadcast.

03:21.030 --> 03:22.150
Thank you all for coming.

03:22.630 --> 03:24.360
Good night, go to bed early.

03:49.630 --> 03:50.520
After multiple layers of filtering

03:51.310 --> 03:52.280
I saw her discomfort.

03:54.630 --> 03:56.150
Don’t you plan to go to Australia to study?

03:56.840 --> 03:57.840
She published a paper.

03:58.150 --> 03:59.150
So what's so embarrassing about this?

03:59.430 --> 04:00.280
There is a problem with the paper.

04:00.520 --> 04:01.360
falsification science

04:03.000 --> 04:03.520
possible

04:04.430 --> 04:05.680
I think he is fake.

04:06.150 --> 04:06.560
Why?

04:07.190 --> 04:08.310
Did you see the comments just now?

04:08.750 --> 04:09.430
There is a passage that reads:

04:09.590 --> 04:10.750
Her family conditions are very good.

04:11.390 --> 04:12.040
but i remember

04:12.120 --> 04:13.510
Her family background is very ordinary.

04:15.510 --> 04:17.000
She seemed to add another sentence

04:17.630 --> 04:18.680
Add another layer of filtering

04:21.240 --> 04:22.390
This live broadcast is not for everyone to see in vain.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.070
So, sir, please give me a reward.

04:26.190 --> 04:26.830
The prize has been completed.

04:58.560 --> 04:59.040
Thanks

05:00.750 --> 05:01.800
How is Huang Zicheng?

05:06.720 --> 05:07.600
Bangkok

05:08.240 --> 05:09.630
Get on with his game.

05:14.120 --> 05:15.160
you change the sample

05:15.680 --> 05:17.070
This isn't just about freeing up long queues.

05:18.190 --> 05:19.270
If Han Jie is captured

05:20.160 --> 05:20.870
Ye Wu must know.

05:20.920 --> 05:21.830
We have intervened.

05:22.480 --> 05:23.630
Huang Zicheng’s situation

05:23.950 --> 05:24.920
This is very dangerous.

05:26.800 --> 05:27.240
Yes

05:28.800 --> 05:29.360
But Huang Zicheng

05:29.430 --> 05:30.800
This is a very good breaking point for us.

05:30.830 --> 05:31.390
We have a responsibility.

05:31.430 --> 05:32.190
keep him safe

05:32.600 --> 05:34.120
But now his situation is not good.

05:35.070 --> 05:35.720
do you know?

05:36.190 --> 05:37.390
Why did Ye Wu drag him into the water?

05:37.680 --> 05:38.040
affim

05:38.560 --> 05:39.040
Likewise, he

05:39.159 --> 05:39.920
Its value lies in its usefulness.

05:40.310 --> 05:40.800
use him

05:40.800 --> 05:42.120
espionage target

05:42.720 --> 05:43.040
Yes

05:43.560 --> 05:44.310
so you

05:44.310 --> 05:44.830
Gradually

05:44.920 --> 05:45.680
Drag him into the water?

05:46.120 --> 05:47.560
I just hope Yewu still wants to take advantage of him.

05:47.800 --> 05:48.950
Wouldn't hurt him easily.

05:49.430 --> 05:50.600
What I'm afraid of now is

05:50.830 --> 05:52.360
I don't give up that easily.

05:52.870 --> 05:54.920
The more you resist, the more dangerous you are.

06:03.120 --> 06:03.600
boss

06:05.070 --> 06:06.120
Today's order

06:06.680 --> 06:07.070
OK

06:28.830 --> 06:30.240
Han Jie received a message.

06:30.680 --> 06:31.160
What?

06:32.310 --> 06:33.270
Product box number 13

06:35.430 --> 06:36.560
The suspect will then deliver the product.

07:41.159 --> 07:42.270
The target is operational.

07:52.390 --> 07:54.240
Come on, come on, it's them.

07:57.510 --> 07:58.510
Come on, come in.

08:07.040 --> 08:08.000
Are you OK? Any questions?

08:09.040 --> 08:10.430
Thirteen boxes, right?

08:10.800 --> 08:11.720
Yes, 13 boxes.

08:13.560 --> 08:14.600
You carry these first, you transport these first.

08:14.750 --> 08:15.360
Those are me.

08:15.800 --> 08:16.240
able

08:22.560 --> 08:23.270
OK, wait a minute.

08:23.270 --> 08:24.390
Lock the door.

08:24.950 --> 08:25.750
Well, trust me.

08:38.390 --> 08:39.390
You push the car back first.

09:22.120 --> 09:22.670
follow him

10:18.120 --> 10:19.030
The temperature inside the locomotive is low.

10:19.360 --> 10:20.720
You only have 15 minutes.

10:21.320 --> 10:22.550
I'll take you out after this.

10:22.720 --> 10:23.360
Be careful.

10:24.030 --> 10:24.600
I see.

11:27.320 --> 11:27.910
I found it

12:29.000 --> 12:29.720
open for business

12:30.750 --> 12:31.320
surpass him

15:51.200 --> 15:52.000
Have you received the goods?

15:52.320 --> 15:52.870
knew.

15:59.840 --> 16:00.320
put it

16:03.270 --> 16:04.960
The car has arrived, let's go.

16:05.550 --> 16:06.000
admit

16:44.240 --> 16:44.840
release

16:45.440 --> 16:45.910
admit

17:03.640 --> 17:04.240
sorry Sorry.

17:05.030 --> 17:05.960
There was a minor accident.

17:06.829 --> 17:07.510
minor accident

17:08.400 --> 17:08.920
minor accident

17:08.920 --> 17:09.880
You were almost frozen into an ice sculpture.

17:09.880 --> 17:10.550
minor accident

17:11.030 --> 17:11.589
you can not

17:11.589 --> 17:12.349
Can I please come in advance?

17:12.750 --> 17:13.200
have

17:19.310 --> 17:20.069
This is it.

17:21.310 --> 17:22.200
I told you in advance

17:22.240 --> 17:23.310
You lift this up.

17:24.160 --> 17:24.790
Then you won't do it?

17:25.109 --> 17:25.550
Come on, hold me.

17:28.590 --> 17:29.110
God

17:30.440 --> 17:31.200
Come on, come on, put on another one.

17:37.030 --> 17:37.790
Post another one.

17:41.750 --> 17:42.510
Come on, come on, carry it on your back.

17:48.110 --> 17:48.680
Are you ok?

17:51.200 --> 17:52.350
Can you turn on the heating for me?

17:53.240 --> 17:54.960
Come on, turn up the heat.

18:26.400 --> 18:26.830
OK

18:39.830 --> 18:40.880
The target has entered customs.

18:44.640 --> 18:45.030
OK

18:46.200 --> 18:46.680
I see.

18:47.960 --> 18:48.550
Thanks

18:50.880 --> 18:52.240
Researcher evaluation completed

18:52.680 --> 18:53.920
The following example B13

18:54.070 --> 18:54.550
real

18:55.270 --> 18:55.920
Not too bad.

18:56.270 --> 18:56.920
normal practice

19:00.160 --> 19:01.790
Used to transport seafood for protection.

19:02.070 --> 19:03.480
This could be Jin Hae's spy.

19:03.590 --> 19:05.200
in gimhae

19:06.160 --> 19:07.640
I sent someone to monitor Han Jie.

19:08.590 --> 19:09.680
Hope to find some clues.

19:09.790 --> 19:11.000
from himself

19:12.350 --> 19:12.880
Yes

19:14.030 --> 19:15.510
Change this example to the cleaning lady

19:15.640 --> 19:16.720
Until now, we haven't found it.

19:17.510 --> 19:18.160
Do you have any clues?

19:19.070 --> 19:20.240
That person is familiar with the institute.

19:20.400 --> 19:21.270
very familiar

19:21.830 --> 19:22.550
With Yu Xiaoyue

19:22.550 --> 19:23.480
perfect cooperation

19:24.110 --> 19:25.440
You suspect that he knows Yu Xiaoyue.

19:26.430 --> 19:27.440
Maybe this is the person we're looking for.

19:27.440 --> 19:28.030
So professor

19:29.350 --> 19:29.830
Director Qin

19:30.440 --> 19:31.160
I recommend it to Xiaoyue

19:31.240 --> 19:32.160
secret search

19:32.350 --> 19:33.270
confirm her identity

19:34.200 --> 19:34.590
agree

19:39.350 --> 19:40.480
I've been eating these for years.

19:40.510 --> 19:41.240
Aren't you greasy?

19:43.270 --> 19:43.960
That's very good.

19:45.510 --> 19:47.070
Sometimes you have to change the taste.

19:48.830 --> 19:49.830
I don't like taking risks.

19:52.790 --> 19:53.640
i see you at work

19:53.640 --> 19:54.400
This is equally dangerous.

19:54.750 --> 19:56.240
So that's enough.

19:59.310 --> 20:00.000
when you work

20:00.160 --> 20:00.720
very funny

20:03.830 --> 20:04.200
able

20:05.350 --> 20:06.310
So let's talk about special missions.

20:07.480 --> 20:07.920
Say it.

20:09.750 --> 20:10.790
You said this game

20:11.070 --> 20:11.960
What exactly is charm?

20:12.510 --> 20:13.720
able to attract so many players.

20:14.590 --> 20:15.590
you need to know

20:15.960 --> 20:16.720
Why does Huang Zicheng have to play?

20:16.750 --> 20:17.440
this game

20:18.200 --> 20:18.640
this case

20:18.750 --> 20:20.070
It happened because of this game

20:20.640 --> 20:21.640
Then I must understand.

20:21.640 --> 20:22.480
I understand enough.

20:25.830 --> 20:27.590
Then you go try it and see for yourself.

20:31.070 --> 20:31.680
Be reasonable

21:13.550 --> 21:15.110
Welcome to the spy game.

21:16.480 --> 21:17.830
You must pass the interview.

21:18.270 --> 21:19.880
Get in-game features

21:21.110 --> 21:22.070
During the interview

21:22.270 --> 21:24.350
All questions must be answered honestly.

21:30.030 --> 21:30.790
What's the name?

21:31.590 --> 21:32.270
Huang Zicheng

21:32.590 --> 21:33.400
Passport number

21:34.110 --> 21:37.350
ED1910726

21:37.830 --> 21:38.400
Profession

21:38.920 --> 21:39.350
Unemployed

21:41.400 --> 21:42.070
Please wait

22:01.030 --> 22:01.440
Are you OK

22:02.830 --> 22:03.400
Didn't go in

22:04.720 --> 22:05.880
I use my brother's name.

22:05.960 --> 22:07.070
and registered passport information

22:07.790 --> 22:08.480
Already rejected me

22:08.590 --> 22:09.030
affim

22:09.640 --> 22:11.030
This machine can distinguish

22:11.030 --> 22:12.070
photo of your face

22:12.680 --> 22:13.680
and the identity information you provide

22:13.830 --> 22:14.550
inconsistent

22:14.750 --> 22:15.440
So I can't get in

22:16.350 --> 22:18.070
Why is real-name authentication still needed?

22:18.750 --> 22:20.440
But even if you use your own name

22:20.720 --> 22:21.680
Not sure I can get in.

22:22.480 --> 22:23.070
Why?

22:23.750 --> 22:24.640
because of your career

22:24.750 --> 22:25.920
not disclose information

22:26.750 --> 22:27.880
We are a confidentiality mechanism.

22:28.200 --> 22:29.000
Can't find it online

22:29.000 --> 22:30.030
Our careers information

22:30.830 --> 22:32.310
Unless you say you're unemployed.

22:32.680 --> 22:33.030
otherwise

22:33.070 --> 22:34.750
It will admit that you lied.

22:35.720 --> 22:36.440
But unemployed

22:37.030 --> 22:38.240
Failed to pass inspection

22:38.790 --> 22:40.110
The game has thresholds.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.350
So it's just a game.

22:43.590 --> 22:44.240
You can come and see us.

22:44.350 --> 22:44.960
Is it that clean?

22:45.680 --> 22:46.790
What about the era of big data?

22:47.440 --> 22:48.590
The traces you leave on the Internet

22:48.720 --> 22:49.680
will be recorded

22:50.200 --> 22:50.880
The game will pass.

22:51.030 --> 22:52.400
Facial and passport data recognition

22:52.680 --> 22:53.400
Check everyone

22:53.510 --> 22:54.550
What needs to be clear is

22:57.960 --> 22:59.030
Come this far

23:00.030 --> 23:00.720
He must have

23:00.830 --> 23:01.680
Excellent technical team

23:01.790 --> 23:02.750
support behind

23:03.590 --> 23:04.310
not just ordinary people

23:04.440 --> 23:05.680
Any game developer can do it.

23:06.400 --> 23:07.270
That's what this game is.

23:07.400 --> 23:08.720
The first attractive point

23:09.350 --> 23:10.270
The real feeling is very strong.

23:12.510 --> 23:13.030
the second?

23:13.790 --> 23:14.550
High return

23:15.400 --> 23:16.480
In-game transactions

23:16.720 --> 23:17.270
Can be redeemed

23:17.400 --> 23:18.550
real money

23:18.920 --> 23:19.550
also

23:19.880 --> 23:21.200
There are also high prizes.

23:21.440 --> 23:22.680
Best Officer Competition

23:23.720 --> 23:24.550
this will attract

23:24.720 --> 23:25.880
More professional players

23:26.110 --> 23:26.920
Use games to live

23:27.240 --> 23:27.640
Yes

23:29.200 --> 23:29.720
The third?

23:30.160 --> 23:30.590
have no idea

23:31.030 --> 23:31.640
have no idea

23:33.000 --> 23:34.400
People who can choose this game

23:34.480 --> 23:35.590
They are all such people

23:35.720 --> 23:36.720
full of doubts

23:37.270 --> 23:39.200
They want to use games to investigate.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.350
this unknown world

23:41.550 --> 23:42.750
The missions of both parties are unclear

23:42.920 --> 23:44.200
Full of unknown challenges

23:44.550 --> 23:45.720
Didn't realize it.

23:45.880 --> 23:46.550
Give it to someone who boasts.

23:46.590 --> 23:48.000
full of dangerous spirit

23:48.200 --> 23:50.030
The more I remember this game

23:55.550 --> 23:56.070
not understand

24:15.070 --> 24:15.790
Arrived, arrived

24:26.150 --> 24:27.070
Is it interesting?

24:27.480 --> 24:28.110
Is not fun

24:28.830 --> 24:29.920
I want to help you.

24:30.030 --> 24:31.400
Didn't he enter the officer status in advance?

24:31.720 --> 24:33.000
This is already too fast.

24:34.110 --> 24:35.440
What time is it now, brother?

24:35.440 --> 24:36.440
You look at your phone.

24:37.030 --> 24:37.480
you think

24:37.590 --> 24:38.720
Are we really on vacation?

24:44.400 --> 24:44.920
This place is probably

24:45.030 --> 24:45.880
Delivery location

24:46.160 --> 24:47.030
Shipped so soon?

24:47.440 --> 24:48.640
This game is really boring.

24:53.350 --> 24:56.070
Spies spend their lives protecting secrets.

25:01.790 --> 25:02.590
What does it mean?

25:03.720 --> 25:04.680
protect secrets

25:05.160 --> 25:06.110
Still have to live

25:07.030 --> 25:07.830
Play big

25:08.510 --> 25:08.920
Yes

25:09.200 --> 25:09.790
Where is our secret?

25:10.960 --> 25:11.440
Why are you here?

25:19.920 --> 25:20.590
I'm running errands.

25:21.550 --> 25:22.510
You can trust me.

25:30.880 --> 25:32.160
Is this your first time in Thailand?

25:33.110 --> 25:34.550
First time with a woman

25:35.720 --> 25:36.110
you?

25:37.480 --> 25:37.960
I

25:38.590 --> 25:39.240
I've been here before.

25:39.680 --> 25:40.200
alone

26:36.310 --> 26:37.200
An iced Americano

26:37.880 --> 26:39.070
Same, thank you.

26:42.110 --> 26:42.830
There seems to be someone behind.

26:42.830 --> 26:43.590
Always follow us

26:44.640 --> 26:45.240
Don't look, don't look

26:46.240 --> 26:47.550
Coffee is done.

26:47.750 --> 26:48.270
WHO？

26:48.480 --> 26:50.590
Maybe someone in this game.

26:51.720 --> 26:52.790
game

26:55.590 --> 26:56.750
sorry Sorry.

26:56.920 --> 26:58.030
no problem, no problem.

26:58.270 --> 26:59.200
Have you been following us?

27:04.200 --> 27:06.070
The trade is temporarily halted when a thief appears.

27:08.790 --> 27:09.590
What about insulated glass?

27:10.830 --> 27:11.310
It's open now

27:12.880 --> 27:13.400
I already told you.

27:13.440 --> 27:14.030
This game is not that easy.

27:14.030 --> 27:15.000
It really doesn't exist anymore.

27:20.480 --> 27:20.920
No need to chase anymore.

27:21.830 --> 27:22.350
She also had an accomplice.

27:24.070 --> 27:24.880
We left through the back of the kitchen.

27:25.640 --> 27:26.240
What does it mean?

27:38.160 --> 27:39.350
In fact, you are already prepared.

27:39.590 --> 27:41.000
Why didn't you tell me in the first place?

27:41.270 --> 27:43.160
Life is like a drama, it depends on acting skills

29:21.480 --> 29:22.160
Are you OK?

29:26.110 --> 29:27.240
not on computer

29:27.590 --> 29:28.830
in computer

29:29.960 --> 29:30.550
Anything else?

29:35.790 --> 29:36.480
but

29:37.440 --> 29:38.400
It appears to have been installed.

29:38.440 --> 29:39.920
CCTV software

29:42.160 --> 29:42.830
Who's in the CCTV cameras?

29:48.720 --> 29:49.720
The other party has already cut it.

29:50.110 --> 29:50.480
never

29:50.480 --> 29:51.310
Search for deals online

29:57.440 --> 29:58.550
Do you want your passport back?

29:59.720 --> 30:00.110
Yes

30:00.960 --> 30:02.270
The experiment is over.

30:02.350 --> 30:03.480
I've already asked for leave.

30:03.590 --> 30:04.960
I want my passport back.

30:05.510 --> 30:06.000
cannot

30:07.000 --> 30:07.920
your situation

30:08.830 --> 30:09.750
Your passport has not been handed to you yet.

30:10.160 --> 30:10.640
Why?

30:12.400 --> 30:13.510
This has not yet passed the confidentiality period.

30:13.920 --> 30:14.590
laboratory staff

30:14.720 --> 30:15.680
Still unable to leave the country temporarily

30:16.830 --> 30:18.550
But the experiment is complete.

30:19.400 --> 30:20.680
No matter what your experiment is

30:21.070 --> 30:22.000
When will it be completed?

30:22.880 --> 30:23.590
follow the rules

30:23.830 --> 30:25.310
There must be a two-month confidentiality period.

30:27.350 --> 30:28.160
two months

30:32.590 --> 30:33.400
I took it

30:33.440 --> 30:34.790
Can my passport be returned?

30:35.480 --> 30:37.070
I remember it was about to expire.

30:37.240 --> 30:38.480
I took it and changed it a little bit.

30:39.070 --> 30:40.310
no matter what difficulties you face

30:41.400 --> 30:42.400
Can't break the rules

30:48.200 --> 30:48.920
This is because

30:48.960 --> 30:49.920
Is this the reason?

30:51.510 --> 30:52.000
Yes

30:52.480 --> 30:53.310
Why is it even a holiday?

30:53.440 --> 30:54.400
I can't take it anymore.

30:56.070 --> 30:56.750
This is not a holiday.

30:56.920 --> 30:58.350
There is no need to go abroad.

31:00.110 --> 31:00.640
but

31:01.750 --> 31:03.200
I don’t just go on vacation.

31:03.270 --> 31:04.790
I still have to participate.

31:04.790 --> 31:05.830
my relative's wedding

31:06.640 --> 31:07.880
I beg you to let me go.

31:08.030 --> 31:08.440
able?

31:08.880 --> 31:09.480
relatively

31:10.270 --> 31:11.640
Do you have relatives abroad?

31:13.200 --> 31:13.640
No

31:14.110 --> 31:14.720
cousin

31:15.830 --> 31:17.200
Then you should apply in advance.

31:17.640 --> 31:18.920
Now is a special time.

31:19.350 --> 31:20.830
I really can't approve it for you.

31:21.070 --> 31:22.160
I hope you can understand.

31:27.350 --> 31:27.830
OK

31:29.400 --> 31:30.030
on her computer

31:30.240 --> 31:31.350
on her computer

31:32.400 --> 31:33.270
When contacting online

31:33.550 --> 31:34.510
We'll find out soon.

31:35.550 --> 31:35.960
let's go.

32:44.440 --> 32:44.960
sir ray

32:46.240 --> 32:46.880
come here.

32:51.920 --> 32:52.510
Dr. Byrne

32:53.070 --> 32:53.880
close the door

32:56.830 --> 32:58.830
I've seen your topic report.

32:59.270 --> 33:00.270
Well written

33:02.110 --> 33:04.070
That is, there are two points.

33:04.310 --> 33:05.400
You can change it a little bit.

33:06.590 --> 33:07.790
I get it, thanks Borders.

33:08.750 --> 33:09.400
That is,

33:10.440 --> 33:11.550
Xiao Yu

33:12.030 --> 33:13.110
What's going on with you these days?

33:14.310 --> 33:15.550
i see your condition

33:15.720 --> 33:16.920
not too good

33:18.200 --> 33:19.720
What's wrong?

33:20.880 --> 33:21.880
She hasn't been feeling well lately.

33:22.310 --> 33:23.550
Maybe it's because I've done OT before.

33:23.680 --> 33:24.400
I'm tired.

33:27.240 --> 33:28.240
like this

33:29.590 --> 33:30.960
Please trust me. it's not a big deal.

33:35.350 --> 33:35.830
able

33:36.790 --> 33:37.400
you go.

33:38.640 --> 33:39.350
So I'm leaving.

33:48.000 --> 33:48.790
Yu Xiaoyue's home

33:49.000 --> 33:49.920
No gaming equipment

33:50.350 --> 33:51.240
phone computer

33:51.590 --> 33:52.510
There are no gaming apps either.

33:53.400 --> 33:54.510
She may not be a professor.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.640
But she went to the library.

33:57.920 --> 33:59.000
They also stole samples.

33:59.510 --> 34:00.000
she may be

34:00.000 --> 34:01.030
professor's subordinate

34:01.680 --> 34:03.190
But her computer was monitored by CCTV.

34:03.550 --> 34:04.000
Who is right?

34:04.510 --> 34:05.070
can't find it

34:08.030 --> 34:08.550
This is Yu Xiaoyue

34:08.710 --> 34:10.320
Why do you have to work for a spy?

34:11.960 --> 34:12.800
There is only one possibility.

34:14.320 --> 34:15.320
She has been controlled by the professor.

34:48.550 --> 34:50.000
Samples have been sent.

34:50.760 --> 34:51.480
no surprise

34:52.800 --> 34:54.440
Your guys are doing pretty well.

34:54.630 --> 34:56.480
Yu Xiaoyue's current condition is not very good.

34:57.550 --> 34:58.110
What's wrong?

34:58.800 --> 34:59.920
She was already panicking.

35:00.760 --> 35:01.840
Today she went to the secret store.

35:01.840 --> 35:02.510
Bring your passport.

35:03.840 --> 35:05.030
I'm worried she'll be in trouble.

35:06.760 --> 35:07.400
stupid

35:09.030 --> 35:10.760
I still think she is someone who can be used.

35:11.110 --> 35:12.670
She is not as innocent as she appears.

35:13.880 --> 35:14.510
You keep an eye on her.

35:16.400 --> 35:17.760
If danger is found

35:18.550 --> 35:19.480
throw away immediately

35:20.670 --> 35:21.280
I know

35:35.960 --> 35:37.070
Any news there?

35:37.230 --> 35:37.710
No

35:38.710 --> 35:39.320
real

35:40.230 --> 35:41.630
A little abnormal

35:43.840 --> 35:44.150
It doesn't matter.

35:44.280 --> 35:45.480
There is no use overthinking.

35:46.030 --> 35:47.510
The future is unpredictable.

35:47.920 --> 35:48.710
If you see this action, stop the action.

35:50.590 --> 35:51.280
that's right.

35:52.000 --> 35:52.760
I really can't think of it.

35:53.230 --> 35:55.400
This offline mission is very exciting.

35:56.550 --> 35:57.480
Definitely already

35:58.150 --> 35:59.630
Rewards are hard earned.

36:00.280 --> 36:00.880
this game

36:01.000 --> 36:02.150
If only there were bonuses

36:02.360 --> 36:03.400
Game level design

36:03.550 --> 36:04.480
if you are really stupid

36:04.840 --> 36:06.000
I do not want to play.

36:07.280 --> 36:08.400
crazy

36:08.800 --> 36:09.630
Don't you feel it?

36:10.190 --> 36:11.800
Game experience and game rewards

36:11.880 --> 36:12.510
This is also important.

36:13.630 --> 36:14.320
Think about it.

36:14.630 --> 36:16.110
before playing games

36:16.440 --> 36:17.800
before playing games

36:18.190 --> 36:19.360
when you play games

36:19.510 --> 36:20.400
that adrenaline

36:20.440 --> 36:21.280
increased feeling

36:21.960 --> 36:23.760
after you win the game

36:23.920 --> 36:24.630
that sense of honor

36:25.030 --> 36:26.190
Yes, money can buy it, right?

36:27.230 --> 36:27.630
I can't figure it out at all.

36:27.630 --> 36:28.630
You are also passionate about games.

36:29.070 --> 36:30.710
I used to be a professional gamer.

36:31.070 --> 36:32.670
Prizes and game steps

36:33.030 --> 36:34.110
as important as me

36:35.070 --> 36:35.840
Pros

36:36.840 --> 36:37.670
I've competed before.

36:39.190 --> 36:39.960
Still can't play?

36:41.070 --> 36:41.670
How else would you get in?

36:41.710 --> 36:42.710
What about the secret mission we agreed on?

36:43.710 --> 36:44.800
Not yet, not yet, because

36:44.880 --> 36:45.590
my old teammates

36:45.630 --> 36:46.480
Always pulling me to play

36:46.960 --> 36:48.030
You have always been my partner.

36:48.230 --> 36:49.230
Higher level than me

36:49.710 --> 36:50.800
But this offline mission

36:50.840 --> 36:51.590
choose me

36:51.670 --> 36:52.360
She wasn't chosen.

36:52.440 --> 36:53.400
This made her angry.

36:53.670 --> 36:54.400
partner

36:55.840 --> 36:56.280
Is it a woman?

36:56.960 --> 36:57.590
how do you know?

36:59.190 --> 36:59.800
Honey

37:00.670 --> 37:01.710
Tiezi

37:03.000 --> 37:03.880
if you talk like this

37:04.070 --> 37:05.230
My sister will be very sad.

37:05.590 --> 37:06.190
So between men and women

37:06.320 --> 37:07.590
There is no real friendship.

37:08.070 --> 37:08.670
small

37:09.590 --> 37:11.190
So we two are partners, right?

37:12.590 --> 37:13.440
We are two different people.

37:15.280 --> 37:16.000
Why are they different?

37:35.670 --> 37:36.070
go.

39:21.360 --> 39:22.440
Sent a message but no reply.

39:27.070 --> 39:27.960
where are you going?

39:30.230 --> 39:31.190
I can't wait for next year.

39:31.760 --> 39:32.440
I gotta go

39:32.840 --> 39:33.630
I will go abroad

39:35.710 --> 39:36.760
Why so suddenly?

39:37.150 --> 39:38.510
Isn’t the announcement for next year?

39:40.510 --> 39:41.550
There is no need to leave now.

39:41.960 --> 39:42.320
Yu Xiaoyue

39:42.400 --> 39:43.630
Apply to study abroad

39:43.670 --> 39:44.230
she may

39:44.320 --> 39:44.880
use this opportunity

39:45.000 --> 39:45.920
He has fled abroad.

39:47.110 --> 39:48.480
I've told you the secret.

39:48.670 --> 39:49.510
can't let you go

39:51.110 --> 39:52.360
Isn't it good to stay in the institute?

39:53.280 --> 39:54.110
We study this area.

39:54.150 --> 39:54.760
two years ago

39:54.880 --> 39:55.710
very developed

39:57.110 --> 39:57.550
And one more thing

39:57.590 --> 39:59.000
List of Dr. Byun’s research group

39:59.230 --> 40:00.360
It's not easy to get.

40:00.840 --> 40:01.880
I know you are the one who can help me.

40:01.920 --> 40:02.760
come to me

40:03.070 --> 40:04.190
You don’t have to stress this all the time.

40:05.760 --> 40:06.590
I did not mean that.

40:06.760 --> 40:07.590
So what do you mean?

40:08.400 --> 40:09.360
Reinforce it over and over again.

40:09.480 --> 40:10.400
You were the one who helped me get into the lab.

40:10.400 --> 40:11.480
I know

40:11.760 --> 40:13.070
I know you helped me, Chu Lei.

40:13.280 --> 40:14.150
You help me with this, help me with that.

40:14.230 --> 40:14.710
I know everything

40:14.840 --> 40:16.400
Can I thank you?

40:20.920 --> 40:21.710
The relationship between the two of them

40:21.760 --> 40:22.880
It looks complicated.

40:26.400 --> 40:27.590
Give me Chu Lei's information again.

40:31.190 --> 40:31.590
This Shi Lei

40:31.710 --> 40:32.800
He is Yu Xiaoyue's senior.

40:32.920 --> 40:33.710
The study has been accredited by the school.

40:33.840 --> 40:34.510
after graduation

40:34.550 --> 40:35.230
I was hired immediately.

40:35.320 --> 40:35.920
Research institute

40:36.230 --> 40:37.280
I have been following Dr. Byun ever since.

40:38.760 --> 40:39.800
But he takes no responsibility.

40:39.800 --> 40:40.800
B13 project

40:48.320 --> 40:49.150
if you can help me

40:49.280 --> 40:50.000
thank you

40:50.480 --> 40:51.230
if you can't help me

40:51.360 --> 40:52.360
Don't cause trouble for me here.

40:54.960 --> 40:56.070
What else do you want me to do for you?

41:05.440 --> 41:06.880
My passport is confidential.

41:07.550 --> 41:08.190
Can you think of a way?

41:08.190 --> 41:09.030
Can you bring it to me?

41:10.150 --> 41:11.280
you are delusional

41:11.800 --> 41:13.230
what can I do?

41:13.710 --> 41:14.670
Do I want to steal it for you?

41:15.480 --> 41:15.840
OK

41:16.590 --> 41:17.440
Then let's break up.

41:18.070 --> 41:18.710
What follows is my story.

41:18.760 --> 41:19.320
You don't have to worry anymore.

41:24.480 --> 41:25.070
Yu Xiaoyue

41:25.960 --> 41:26.510
You are with me.

41:26.550 --> 41:27.400
Are you trying to take advantage of me?

41:27.800 --> 41:28.230
Yes

41:28.630 --> 41:29.630
I don't need you now.

41:29.760 --> 41:30.190
you go.

41:34.920 --> 41:35.510
go.

41:44.230 --> 41:45.150
Chu Lei came out.

42:05.440 --> 42:06.630
Yu Xiaoyue called.

42:15.920 --> 42:16.320
Hello

42:17.670 --> 42:18.190
Yu Xiaoyue

42:18.510 --> 42:19.070
This is me.

42:19.920 --> 42:21.070
You come alone

42:21.320 --> 42:22.280
I sent you the address.

42:23.070 --> 42:24.480
I know, trust me.

42:32.920 --> 42:34.360
Are you going to meet the professor?

42:36.030 --> 42:36.760
Probably
