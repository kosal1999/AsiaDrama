01:31.242 --> 01:36.033
FOR THE SAKE OF LOVE

01:36.114 --> 01:39.122
EPISODE 1

01:54.280 --> 01:55.379
Yu Ling.

01:56.480 --> 01:57.960
Do you need help?

01:58.040 --> 01:59.079
No, thank you.

01:59.159 --> 02:00.680
Let me help you.

02:00.760 --> 02:04.390
So, I can say that I have been involved
in a big interview.

02:05.040 --> 02:07.153
I heard that Mrs. Yi
highly recommended you.

02:07.240 --> 02:09.440
You're our magazine's flagship journalist.

02:09.567 --> 02:11.627
You have to do this interview.

02:12.639 --> 02:15.760
Yu Ling, the sales of the next issue
will definitely skyrocket.

02:15.960 --> 02:17.879
Mrs. Yi has given me
a very important task.

02:17.960 --> 02:19.631
I will try hard.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.920
You lost the opportunity
to interview Shi Yan.

02:26.039 --> 02:29.389
Why are you still reviewing
your interview draft, Zheng Shu Yi?

02:30.489 --> 02:32.802
Shi Yan might be an unusual guy.

02:32.883 --> 02:34.434
I'm just checking my draft again.

02:34.540 --> 02:35.820
Some questions are too conservative.

02:35.910 --> 02:37.064
Obviously it can be improved.

02:37.199 --> 02:38.789
I will perfect it.

02:39.361 --> 02:40.540
Are you okay?

02:40.879 --> 02:43.430
Is missing an interview
making you crazy?

02:44.160 --> 02:45.680
Even if you have a perfect draft,

02:45.800 --> 02:48.389
Shi Yan won't come back to you.

02:49.385 --> 02:52.739
I heard that the Editor-in-Chief
called Mingyu Yunchuang

02:52.840 --> 02:54.220
and highly recommend the guy.

02:54.625 --> 02:58.454
So, tactics are more important
than competence.

02:59.083 --> 03:00.963
There are many important figures.
Even though I lost Shi Yan,

03:01.044 --> 03:02.559
there are still other opportunities.

03:02.639 --> 03:04.919
Having tactics can only
get you one interview,

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
but competence can help you
write good articles.

03:07.160 --> 03:10.030
Because I'm bad at tactics,
I will continue to hone my competence.

03:11.400 --> 03:15.669
It's a pity that you can't help me
see what Shi Yan looks like.

03:15.800 --> 03:17.550
Is he handsome or not?

03:39.520 --> 03:41.267
Mr. Shi, interview
with Financial Introduction

03:41.348 --> 03:42.799
scheduled for 19.00
after dinner.

03:42.960 --> 03:45.682
Journalist Xu Yu Ling will come
to the office to interview you.

03:45.840 --> 03:48.229
I don't think I'd choose Ms. Xu
to interview me.

03:48.320 --> 03:50.760
He is highly recommended
by the Editors of Financial Introduce.

03:50.872 --> 03:52.676
He said Ms. Xu is experienced
in various aspects

03:52.757 --> 03:54.722
and the quality of the writing is quite consistent.

03:56.120 --> 03:58.599
If this is just a question and answer,
there's no need to meet me directly.

03:58.680 --> 04:00.469
Submitting an answer is enough.

04:00.680 --> 04:03.870
Interviews should be like chatting
and self-reflection.

04:04.456 --> 04:07.053
I like Ms. Zheng.

04:07.433 --> 04:08.633
Sorry for my bad judgment.

04:08.714 --> 04:10.385
I'll reschedule.

04:17.280 --> 04:19.602
ZHU XING GUO'S
OPINION ON THE CURRENCY WAR

04:24.407 --> 04:25.747
Mrs. Yi, do you want to meet me?

04:25.864 --> 04:27.284
Well, see you later.

04:33.079 --> 04:34.480
You don't need to comfort me.

04:34.623 --> 04:36.533
I understand. I'm fine.

04:37.237 --> 04:38.497
Understand what?

04:39.569 --> 04:42.048
I know you want to talk
about the interview with Shi Yan.

04:42.199 --> 04:43.459
I understand.

04:43.639 --> 04:45.309
Yu Ling is more experienced
than me.

04:45.519 --> 04:49.160
Although a little disappointed,

04:49.328 --> 04:52.128
My interview draft
can still be improved.

04:52.392 --> 04:54.119
So, no need to regret.

04:54.320 --> 04:56.350
I'll prepare better
next time.

04:58.160 --> 04:59.750
You're dressed very nicely today.

05:01.888 --> 05:03.248
Today is my girlfriend's birthday.

05:03.344 --> 05:05.853
I want to look beautiful in his eyes.

05:06.720 --> 05:09.160
Looking from another point of view,
if I interviewed Shi Yan,

05:09.240 --> 05:11.540
I won't be able to celebrate
with my girlfriend tonight.

05:11.680 --> 05:13.350
So, this is indeed good.

05:19.282 --> 05:20.621
Okay.

05:22.848 --> 05:24.187
What's wrong, Mrs. Yi?

05:25.720 --> 05:27.440
Yunchuang staff just called me.

05:27.558 --> 05:28.965
They said for tonight's interview,

05:29.048 --> 05:30.548
Shi Yan has already appointed you

05:33.329 --> 05:34.469
to do it.

05:35.759 --> 05:38.439
Too bad, you're celebrating
your girlfriend's birthday tonight.

05:38.519 --> 05:40.070
I guess you don't have time, right?

05:42.319 --> 05:44.080
Shi Yan pointed at me?

05:44.240 --> 05:46.590
Yes, he chose you in the end.

05:46.881 --> 05:48.220
Tonight.

05:48.879 --> 05:50.590
Do you mind?

05:51.104 --> 05:52.344
No, I can.

05:52.453 --> 05:53.552
Are you sure?

05:54.600 --> 05:56.999
Great, tonight at 19.00.

05:57.160 --> 06:00.242
Shi Yan's assistant will talk to you
about the details.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.200
OK, I'll get ready right away.

06:02.337 --> 06:03.437
Wait.

06:04.619 --> 06:06.328
What about your boyfriend?

06:07.281 --> 06:08.882
Birthdays come every year,

06:08.976 --> 06:11.256
but the opportunity to interview Shi Yan
was rare.

06:11.559 --> 06:13.309
If I finish everything
as quickly as possible,

06:13.408 --> 06:15.268
maybe there's still time to celebrate
before midnight.

06:18.850 --> 06:20.802
You are like that, Zheng Shu Yi.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.999
Mr. Shi, exclusive interview details
have been arranged.

06:25.079 --> 06:27.779
How about we schedule
the interview in the main conference room?

06:29.983 --> 06:31.293
Wasn't Le'an's representative
scheduled to come ?

06:31.374 --> 06:32.705
for a meeting in the afternoon?

06:32.786 --> 06:34.960
Department One has already booked
the main conference room for the afternoon,

06:35.040 --> 06:36.040
but they canceled it.

06:36.120 --> 06:37.918
It seems they
have rescheduled the meeting

06:37.999 --> 06:39.999
with representatives
from Lieying and Le'an in the morning.

06:41.005 --> 06:42.605
Both in the morning?

06:42.686 --> 06:44.942
Yes, the system shows
it is rescheduled

06:45.022 --> 06:46.912
personally by Mr. Feng
from Department One.

06:53.456 --> 06:55.482
Fan, drop me off somewhere.

06:55.585 --> 06:56.745
I have to go back to the company.

06:56.840 --> 06:58.082
OK, Mr. Shi.

06:59.759 --> 07:01.470
What about Ms. Qin?

07:02.130 --> 07:04.762
Invite him and take him back
to the Shi family's wastu.

07:04.920 --> 07:06.019
Ya, Pak.

07:20.199 --> 07:21.909
Amazing!

07:22.337 --> 07:25.482
You've got the headlines
for nine issues this year.

07:25.640 --> 07:28.522
This has never happened
in our magazine.

07:29.680 --> 07:32.590
Even Bu Yi's record
is only eight editions in a year.

07:38.337 --> 07:40.598
Do you still drink coffee?
Do you want to be better?

07:43.477 --> 07:45.082
Drink this instead.

07:47.800 --> 07:48.839
Why do you think Yunchuang

07:48.920 --> 07:51.720
suddenly change journalists
for interviews?

07:51.800 --> 07:53.960
This shows that their boss
has sharp eyes.

07:54.104 --> 07:55.364
We mean, Shi Yan?

07:55.894 --> 07:58.248
Shi Yan obviously had sharp eyes.

07:58.360 --> 08:01.016
Otherwise, he would not be able to
change Mingyu Yunchuang

08:01.097 --> 08:03.299
became a huge success
in just a few years.

08:04.187 --> 08:06.894
But he's also a bit strange.

08:07.640 --> 08:09.320
When Mingyu Group
faced its most difficult time,

08:09.408 --> 08:11.199
he left his family's company

08:11.279 --> 08:13.679
and start a new company.

08:13.842 --> 08:15.222
What was he thinking?

08:15.617 --> 08:18.602
You don't know how cruel
the rumors about him are,

08:18.720 --> 08:21.280
people call him
the runaway prince,

08:21.376 --> 08:24.162
selfish cowards, and others.

08:24.410 --> 08:27.584
Also, his girlfriend, actress Bei Lin.

08:27.680 --> 08:29.242
They said
he immediately threw it away.

08:29.328 --> 08:32.487
Actually, I think he's quite brave.

08:32.648 --> 08:33.887
Despite all their doubts,

08:33.968 --> 08:35.688
he still chose that path.

08:35.824 --> 08:37.374
That takes great courage.

09:14.440 --> 09:15.800
What an honor for us

09:15.879 --> 09:17.324
if you can establish a partnership
with Lieying.

09:17.405 --> 09:18.802
Mr. Feng, you are too kind.

09:18.905 --> 09:20.042
-We are family.
-Yes.

09:20.143 --> 09:23.122
Appropriate. We've been friends
for years.

09:23.224 --> 09:24.283
Of.

09:26.337 --> 09:27.437
Pak Shi.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.239
Get two cold colas from the kitchen.

09:30.360 --> 09:31.419
Ya, Pak.

09:35.800 --> 09:38.442
I've been working on an article
about Lieying lately.

09:38.592 --> 09:41.602
They said that Yunchuang
is considering investment.

09:41.800 --> 09:43.322
You know about Lieying, right?

09:43.453 --> 09:45.319
They have gained attention
in recent years.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.189
Many companies
are willing to invest in them.

09:49.560 --> 09:53.000
There wasn't a single clear picture
of Shi Yan on the internet.

09:53.137 --> 09:54.617
He became more humble

09:54.728 --> 09:56.917
and never appeared in front of the press
after starting his company.

09:58.465 --> 10:02.664
If we can record exclusive video
or audio of him

10:02.882 --> 10:04.001
for our digital magazine,

10:04.089 --> 10:06.089
it will definitely attract many readers.

10:06.489 --> 10:09.479
Are you still thinking
about upgrading your digital magazine?

10:10.150 --> 10:13.067
Financial information is closely related
to everyone.

10:13.148 --> 10:14.267
If we don't fix it

10:14.391 --> 10:16.550
and stick to the
same content as the print version,

10:16.640 --> 10:18.320
without effective interaction
with readers,

10:18.399 --> 10:20.349
we will only fall further behind.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.558
You're right too.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.317
But our magazine currently
has no human resources or funds

10:27.398 --> 10:29.468
for updates to this digital magazine.

10:29.713 --> 10:31.882
Even if you convince Mrs. Yi,

10:31.993 --> 10:34.103
he will definitely ask you,

10:34.321 --> 10:36.401
who will do it,
how,

10:36.527 --> 10:37.726
and where the funds come from.

10:37.855 --> 10:39.155
I will do it.

10:39.433 --> 10:41.369
I want the higher ups to see

10:41.450 --> 10:43.754
if I have the ability to lead
the updating of digital magazines.

10:43.835 --> 10:45.075
Then, by monetizing the content,

10:45.159 --> 10:46.639
we can get
human resources and funds

10:46.720 --> 10:48.282
from the updated digital magazine.

10:49.289 --> 10:50.729
What a bold idea!

10:50.928 --> 10:53.558
Go for it. I support you!

11:05.673 --> 11:07.232
You should stop by our place more often .

11:07.313 --> 11:08.492
Of course.

11:09.585 --> 11:11.762
-Hai, Pak Shi.
-Hai, Pak Shi.

11:11.900 --> 11:12.940
This is a cold drink.

11:13.021 --> 11:14.381
Thank you, Mr. Shi.

11:16.640 --> 11:17.660
By the way,

11:17.759 --> 11:20.400
I saw your latest data and information
on my way here.

11:20.569 --> 11:22.282
-The progress is very impressive.
-Yes.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.350
We just finished it last night.

11:24.588 --> 11:26.779
Lily, please take Mr. Chen
to the meeting room next door.

11:26.860 --> 11:27.896
I'll follow soon.

11:27.977 --> 11:30.807
OK, Mr. Shi.
Mr. Chen, please follow me.

11:39.160 --> 11:40.260
Pak Shi.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.722
Mr. Shi Yan, if you have any requests,
feel free to say so.

11:46.900 --> 11:50.380
After all, we have a
close relationship with Mingyu.

11:50.976 --> 11:52.215
Over the last two years,

11:52.296 --> 11:55.006
we also do business with your father.

11:55.525 --> 11:58.642
Of course, considering the circumstances at that time,

11:58.831 --> 12:01.181
We definitely want to help.

12:01.657 --> 12:02.977
So, I'm sure

12:03.118 --> 12:06.214
we will work
well together this time.

12:09.840 --> 12:12.722
Mr. Shi, do you have any questions?

12:13.655 --> 12:14.676
Thank You.

12:14.912 --> 12:16.962
I've reviewed the situation
with Lieying,

12:17.136 --> 12:18.496
but that's what interests me more

12:18.696 --> 12:21.725
is the direction of your company in the future.

12:23.393 --> 12:27.982
Our company is among
the top leaders in this industry.

12:28.322 --> 12:30.845
As for Le'an Technology,

12:30.992 --> 12:33.372
they used to be
one of our suppliers.

12:33.551 --> 12:35.422
This has nothing to do
with position in the industry.

12:35.970 --> 12:38.050
According to information,

12:38.176 --> 12:42.202
If your company's main goal
is to serve the wider community,

12:42.368 --> 12:45.287
there must be further technological progress .

12:45.448 --> 12:47.879
But so far
I haven't seen a solution.

12:50.096 --> 12:52.127
Mr. Shi, this is the problem.

12:52.240 --> 12:54.830
Lieying is a well-established company.

12:55.105 --> 12:58.825
Investing in them will help us
enter this industry quickly.

12:59.036 --> 13:02.678
Apart from that, Lieying has a close relationship
with Mingyu.

13:02.759 --> 13:04.496
We have gone through
ups and downs together.

13:04.577 --> 13:05.882
Correct.

13:06.072 --> 13:07.282
Yes, I understand.

13:07.544 --> 13:09.464
My father respects Lieying very much.

13:11.695 --> 13:13.976
But business is still business.

13:14.080 --> 13:16.910
The essence of investing
is buying future value.

13:17.177 --> 13:19.047
If Lieying is willing to cooperate
with Yunchuang,

13:19.130 --> 13:22.522
You have to make a plan
to upgrade your core technology.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.008
After all,
we are an investment company,

13:25.136 --> 13:26.555
not a charity.

13:26.736 --> 13:27.997
Don't you agree?

13:31.799 --> 13:33.749
Thank you for your
valuable time today.

13:38.801 --> 13:41.233
Mr. Feng, please take Mr. Li away.

13:42.872 --> 13:43.972
Pak Li.

13:49.348 --> 13:50.488
Pak Li.

13:57.221 --> 13:59.882
- Mr. Li.
- Mr. Chen, please pass by here.

14:06.296 --> 14:08.136
Technical breakthroughs take time,

14:08.266 --> 14:09.386
but once achieved,

14:09.547 --> 14:12.282
it would be a revolutionary boost
to our domestic chip production.

14:12.449 --> 14:13.842
So, keep up the good work

14:13.920 --> 14:16.039
and create our own patent.

14:16.226 --> 14:17.361
I have high hopes for you.

14:17.560 --> 14:19.682
Yunchuang will provide you with
maximum support.

14:20.240 --> 14:21.460
Thank you, Mr. Shi.

14:21.715 --> 14:24.193
If we can solve
the research and development funding problem,

14:24.369 --> 14:26.599
I am very confident that we can
achieve significant progress.

14:26.976 --> 14:28.802
I will visit Le'an again tomorrow.

14:28.890 --> 14:32.322
-We can discuss further.
-Okay, I have to go.

14:37.841 --> 14:38.902
Pak Shi,

14:39.313 --> 14:40.613
I'll be straight forward.

14:41.054 --> 14:44.762
The owner of Lieying, Mr. Li,
is an old friend of your father and Mr. Tian.

14:45.026 --> 14:47.322
If you insist on choosing Le'an,

14:47.625 --> 14:51.122
I'm afraid it won't be easy to convince the council.

14:51.696 --> 14:53.917
Meetings are a fundamental part
of investing.

14:54.177 --> 14:57.017
If you can't even schedule
a meeting with a potential partner,

14:57.232 --> 14:59.332
how can I trust
your assessment of this project?

14:59.852 --> 15:01.919
Mingyu's investment is based
on future trends,

15:02.051 --> 15:03.635
not a personal connection.

15:11.408 --> 15:12.548
Pak Tian.

15:12.880 --> 15:15.671
Mr. Shi suddenly came
during our meeting today.

15:16.120 --> 15:17.259
Hai, Pak Shi.

15:23.556 --> 15:26.627
(Uncle, didn't you promise
to pick me up today?)

15:26.712 --> 15:27.872
There's something urgent.

15:28.039 --> 15:30.120
(Uncle, don't you love me anymore?)

15:30.200 --> 15:31.220
Pak Shi.

15:31.482 --> 15:33.340
I have to go. We will talk again later.

15:33.919 --> 15:35.430
I've put Ms. Qin.

15:35.673 --> 15:38.189
He complained
because you didn't pick him up yourself

15:38.280 --> 15:39.959
and asked me to convey his complaint.

15:40.065 --> 15:41.264
Is there anything else?

15:41.384 --> 15:44.403
Yes, Mr. Guan Ji said he couldn't
contact you by phone.

15:44.712 --> 15:45.754
What he wants?

15:45.880 --> 15:47.999
Pak Guan Ji held a dinner
today at Warner Estate.

15:48.080 --> 15:50.030
He insisted you attend.

15:50.197 --> 15:51.256
I am busy.

15:51.680 --> 15:54.319
Mr. Guan Ji had anticipated
you would say that.

15:54.472 --> 15:57.261
He said there was an important person
he wanted to introduce to you.

16:04.458 --> 16:06.522
YU YOU

16:10.600 --> 16:13.070
OK, tell him
I'll come tonight.

16:13.437 --> 16:15.706
How about
tonight's Financial Introduction interview?

16:18.008 --> 16:21.174
Explain the situation to them
and reschedule.

16:21.512 --> 16:23.062
Fine, I'll do it right away.

16:35.292 --> 16:37.319
(Honey, you're not working overtime today, are you?)

16:37.400 --> 16:38.660
Xing Zhou,

16:39.681 --> 16:43.470
do you remember the interview with Shi Yan
that I told you about?

16:44.120 --> 16:45.639
Bu Yi just told me

16:45.720 --> 16:47.042
if they have changed journalists

16:47.160 --> 16:49.762
to interview Shi Yan.
I'm doing it now.

16:49.843 --> 16:51.482
(But my birthday
is only once a year.)

16:51.593 --> 16:53.014
I'm sorry, Xing Zhou.

16:53.512 --> 16:56.153
I've been preparing for this interview
for over two months.

16:56.234 --> 16:58.184
This is truly a rare opportunity.

16:58.385 --> 16:59.825
He asked me specifically.

16:59.905 --> 17:03.142
If I don't come, we won't have
a headline for the next issue.

17:03.904 --> 17:07.064
You know how many stories
he has.

17:07.200 --> 17:10.519
He hasn't done any interviews
since founding Mingyu Yunchuang.

17:10.665 --> 17:13.135
This will be
his first exclusive interview.

17:14.049 --> 17:16.282
(Alright. I guess we can
celebrate later.)

17:16.480 --> 17:18.722
(I'll wait for you downstairs
after my work is finished.)

17:19.337 --> 17:20.718
I'm sorry, Xing Zhou.

17:20.827 --> 17:22.127
This is very sudden.

17:22.919 --> 17:24.402
(I understand.)

17:24.672 --> 17:27.122
(You've done a lot of preparation
for this interview.)

17:27.208 --> 17:28.629
(You should make the most of it
.)

17:30.799 --> 17:32.002
Thank you, Xing Zhou.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.412
You are the best.

17:34.401 --> 17:35.973
Interviews start at 19.00.

17:36.054 --> 17:37.762
I'll try to finish it
within two hours.

17:37.880 --> 17:40.039
There's still time to see you,
blow out the candles, make a wish,

17:40.120 --> 17:41.380
and enjoy birthday cake.

17:42.421 --> 17:43.971
(I'll come pick you up later.)

17:45.160 --> 17:46.981
I'll send you my location later.

17:47.620 --> 17:48.761
You are so kind.

17:56.337 --> 17:58.322
So, your boyfriend doesn't mind?

17:58.849 --> 18:02.149
Yes, he understood and even offered
to pick me up.

18:03.402 --> 18:07.199
Your boyfriend seems too understanding.

18:08.168 --> 18:10.648
Unlike my boyfriend,
he is very possessive.

18:10.864 --> 18:12.399
If I cancel my promise just once,

18:12.480 --> 18:15.029
whatever the reason,
he will be angry with me.

18:17.112 --> 18:18.172
Let's go.

18:29.528 --> 18:32.398
(Halo, Nn. Zheng.
Aku Chen Sheng dari Mingyu Yunchuang.)

18:33.080 --> 18:34.461
Hello Pak Chen.

18:34.920 --> 18:36.639
Ms. Zheng, Mr. Shi has to cancel

18:36.720 --> 18:38.399
interview tonight
for personal reasons.

18:38.480 --> 18:39.482
We need to reschedule.

18:39.563 --> 18:40.602
(We are very sorry.)

18:41.857 --> 18:44.097
What day does Mr. Shi want
to reschedule the interview?

18:44.360 --> 18:46.400
(How about the same day
next week?)

18:46.480 --> 18:48.660
(Or is there a
convenient time for you next week?)

18:49.161 --> 18:50.921
If we reschedule
for next week,

18:51.033 --> 18:53.663
We don't have a headline
for the next issue.

18:54.432 --> 18:57.352
Can Mr. Shi spare some time
in the next two days?

18:57.552 --> 18:59.192
The timing is not a problem.

18:59.384 --> 19:00.805
We can even divide it
into two sessions.

19:01.096 --> 19:02.616
I think that's impossible.

19:02.720 --> 19:05.589
(Mr Shi's schedule
for the next two days is already full.)

19:06.680 --> 19:07.980
So...

19:08.705 --> 19:10.505
How about spending two hours
tonight?

19:10.667 --> 19:12.218
One hour is not a problem.

19:12.520 --> 19:13.960
Mr. Shi has personal matters tonight.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.320
He couldn't spare the time.

19:15.400 --> 19:16.500
(We're really sorry.)

19:16.960 --> 19:18.061
Wait...

19:28.888 --> 19:31.087
Shan Shan, you are beautiful
and have many connections.

19:31.168 --> 19:33.838
Can you help me find out
where Shi Yan will be tonight?

19:45.079 --> 19:46.299
Halo.

19:50.599 --> 19:52.099
Shi Yan?

19:52.392 --> 19:54.102
I don't know him.

19:55.247 --> 19:56.838
But you're lucky.

19:57.064 --> 20:00.666
(I know Shi Yan's good friend, Guan Ji,)

20:01.280 --> 20:04.320
(holding a private banquet
at Warner Estate tonight.)

20:04.424 --> 20:05.744
(I think there are many people in Jiangcheng)

20:05.840 --> 20:07.886
(Those with connections
to Guan Capital will attend.)

20:07.967 --> 20:09.717
(I'm not sure
if Shi Yan will be there.)

20:10.080 --> 20:11.669
Well then,
I'll try my luck.

20:12.759 --> 20:13.962
(Wait.)

20:14.192 --> 20:15.524
(Aren't you supposed to celebrate)

20:15.652 --> 20:17.442
(Yue Xing Zhou's birthday tonight?)

20:18.000 --> 20:20.322
(You're going to cancel?)

20:20.607 --> 20:22.769
I can't miss Shi Yan, right?

20:22.888 --> 20:24.042
(Okay.)

20:24.248 --> 20:26.642
(Career-focused women
are the most charming.)

20:27.993 --> 20:30.304
Thank you for your kind words.

20:35.505 --> 20:37.295
Warner Estate.

20:58.696 --> 20:59.738
Enjoy.

21:14.304 --> 21:15.564
Come here.

21:30.320 --> 21:32.040
Mr. Chen, good evening.

21:32.121 --> 21:33.482
I'm at Warner Estate now.

21:33.920 --> 21:35.762
(Ms. Zheng, how did you...)

21:37.342 --> 21:38.863
I'm sorry
for coming uninvited,

21:38.960 --> 21:40.439
but this is an urgent matter.

21:40.519 --> 21:43.549
Can you tell Mr. Shi
that I can wait for him here?

21:44.039 --> 21:46.840
Hopefully he can feel my sincerity

21:46.920 --> 21:48.642
and make time for interviews.

21:48.880 --> 21:51.000
That's it,
find a place and wait.

21:51.225 --> 21:53.199
I'll talk to Mr. Shi,

21:53.331 --> 21:55.391
but I can't guarantee that he will have time
to meet you.

21:55.600 --> 21:57.882
(Most likely
you came here in vain.)

21:58.360 --> 22:01.431
I understand. Whatever happens,
I am very grateful to you.

22:06.322 --> 22:07.969
I think Guan Ji held this banquet

22:08.050 --> 22:10.802
for everyone to eat and drink.

22:10.920 --> 22:12.340
It can't be that simple.

22:12.936 --> 22:14.255
Kudengar Yu You

22:14.359 --> 22:17.122
specially recruited by Guan Capital
from abroad.

22:17.264 --> 22:18.982
He is a professor
at the University of Finance and Economics.

22:19.063 --> 22:20.342
Only Guan Capital has the power

22:20.423 --> 22:21.974
to hire him
as a consultant.

22:22.985 --> 22:24.638
I see his son Shi is also here.

22:24.750 --> 22:26.482
Shi Wen Guang's son
was very unreliable.

22:26.632 --> 22:29.512
When Mingyu was in trouble,
he started his own company.

22:29.624 --> 22:31.394
Shi Wen Guang
was forced to entrust the company

22:31.490 --> 22:33.195
to his son-in-law and those outsiders.

22:33.305 --> 22:34.312
Exaggeration.

22:34.393 --> 22:36.873
From what I see,
two young men from the Guan and Shi families

22:37.000 --> 22:38.080
quite ambitious.

22:38.160 --> 22:39.640
By bringing professors
from abroad,

22:39.763 --> 22:42.122
they might be planning
to make a breakthrough.

22:42.680 --> 22:44.519
One is shy and the other
likes to have fun.

22:44.658 --> 22:46.288
What breakthroughs can they make?

22:46.880 --> 22:48.880
It is impossible. Come on.

23:28.560 --> 23:30.430
Is Guan Ji late again?

23:31.973 --> 23:33.360
Mr. Guan Ji said
he was stuck in traffic,

23:33.440 --> 23:35.002
but it will be here
in ten minutes.

23:41.200 --> 23:42.500
Is there anything else?

23:43.873 --> 23:45.802
Ms. Zheng from Financial Introduction
is also here.

23:45.891 --> 23:47.520
He said he would wait for you

23:47.680 --> 23:50.740
and hope you can find time
to do an interview tonight.

23:51.319 --> 23:52.500
Zheng Shu Yi?

23:53.328 --> 23:54.937
Didn't I ask
to reschedule?

23:55.097 --> 23:56.177
I've told him,

23:56.288 --> 23:58.728
but he said
that the interview was cancelled,

23:58.839 --> 24:01.092
The next issue of the magazine
had no headline.

24:01.526 --> 24:04.707
I don't know how he knows
about your personal schedule.

24:05.891 --> 24:07.665
I have a meeting
at Le'an Technology tomorrow,

24:07.816 --> 24:10.286
so I don't have time
for an interview tonight.

24:10.568 --> 24:12.879
Since he came all the way here,
probably hasn't eaten yet.

24:13.073 --> 24:15.592
Prepare food and a car
to take him home.

24:15.688 --> 24:16.808
It's hard to get a taxi here.

24:16.889 --> 24:17.889
Ya, Pak Shi.

24:18.656 --> 24:21.042
Graduated from Harvard University
with a full scholarship.

24:21.201 --> 24:24.894
Double PhD degree in Economics and Finance
from Cambridge University!

24:25.801 --> 24:28.442
Soon became the youngest professor
at the University of Finance and Economics.

24:30.799 --> 24:32.282
Impressive resume.

24:55.559 --> 24:57.500
-Thank You.
-You're welcome.

24:58.117 --> 24:59.337
Wait.

24:59.488 --> 25:02.119
Are you Yu You? Professor Yu?

25:02.857 --> 25:04.482
You know me?

25:05.496 --> 25:08.175
I've read some of your papers.

25:08.280 --> 25:10.683
Financial technology,
technology-based financial innovation,

25:11.057 --> 25:12.898
not only has an impact on macroeconomics,

25:13.039 --> 25:16.042
also has the potential to bring major changes
to our daily lives.

25:16.399 --> 25:18.875
I feel a close connection
to this field

25:18.993 --> 25:20.766
because it is very relevant
to everyday life.

25:20.858 --> 25:24.112
Correct. That is also the reason I
chose this research direction.

25:24.239 --> 25:27.760
In the past, finance and capital
seemed like a luxurious concept,

25:27.936 --> 25:29.616
but now we are exploring

25:29.720 --> 25:33.220
how it can change our life
to what extent.

25:34.537 --> 25:35.617
If you have the chance,

25:35.719 --> 25:36.919
I want to return to my alma mater

25:37.022 --> 25:38.841
and attended some of your lectures,
Professor Yu.

25:40.040 --> 25:42.200
Are you a graduate of
the University of Finance and Economics?

25:42.280 --> 25:44.199
Yes, currently I work
at Financial Introduction.

25:44.280 --> 25:45.562
I'm a journalist.

25:46.488 --> 25:47.984
Professor Yu,
can we be friends on WeChat?

25:48.065 --> 25:49.682
- Mr. Shi.
-Of course.

25:50.549 --> 25:51.670
-I'll scan your code.
-Good.

25:51.776 --> 25:55.322
Itu Zheng Shu Yi
dari Financial Introduce.

25:55.599 --> 25:56.779
Finished.

25:57.697 --> 26:00.322
Zheng Shu Yi.
I'll put "journalist".

26:04.480 --> 26:05.621
Thank You.

26:08.488 --> 26:10.002
Zheng Shu Yi?

26:10.377 --> 26:12.737
Winner of Best Journalist this year

26:12.857 --> 26:13.983
is an article journalist

26:14.080 --> 26:17.227
"Zhu Xing Guo's Opinion
on the Currency War,"

26:17.312 --> 26:18.922
Zheng Shu Yi.

26:47.096 --> 26:49.477
Excuse me. I'm late.

26:50.240 --> 26:53.029
Guan Ji, it's been a long time
since you rode a horse with me.

26:53.480 --> 26:54.840
My fault.

26:55.056 --> 26:57.262
I heard you went to Qionghai,
so I waited for you to come back.

26:57.408 --> 26:58.709
I'm back now.

26:58.839 --> 27:01.430
Then, I will wait for you
at the equestrian club tomorrow.

27:04.440 --> 27:05.719
As far as I know,

27:05.799 --> 27:08.229
Tonight's banquet
is not open to the media.

27:09.221 --> 27:12.267
Yes, I came personally
to wait for the interviewee.

27:17.225 --> 27:19.402
Work is important,
and so is your health.

27:19.606 --> 27:21.628
You don't look well.

27:22.790 --> 27:24.890
No, I'll be fine
after taking the medicine.

27:31.608 --> 27:32.722
We went in first.

27:32.830 --> 27:33.870
Of.

27:39.480 --> 27:40.700
I have to go.

27:50.576 --> 27:51.876
Come in.

28:05.797 --> 28:07.019
Pak Shi!

28:10.194 --> 28:12.682
Sorry, Ms. Zheng. Mr. Shi really
doesn't have time tonight,

28:12.810 --> 28:15.756
but I will
arrange an interview as soon as possible.

28:16.968 --> 28:18.208
You haven't had dinner yet, have you?

28:18.332 --> 28:19.571
Please eat first

28:19.652 --> 28:21.283
and I will prepare a car
to take you home.

28:22.440 --> 28:24.420
It doesn't matter. Someone picked me up.

28:29.640 --> 28:31.229
I almost succeeded.

28:31.969 --> 28:34.399
At least, let me see
what you look like.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.880
-Long time no see.
-Yes, that's right, Mr. Zhang.

28:38.096 --> 28:41.075
-Long time no see.
-Pleased to meet you.

28:44.519 --> 28:46.779
Mr. Wang, how are you?

28:51.736 --> 28:52.776
Hello, Professor Yu.

28:52.872 --> 28:54.013
Welcome back to China.

28:54.319 --> 28:55.802
Hello, Mr. Shi. Thank You.

28:57.391 --> 28:58.959
I read your research

28:59.039 --> 29:00.492
regarding the impact of financial limitations

29:00.573 --> 29:02.902
on the
financing behavior of public companies.

29:03.442 --> 29:05.362
This differs
from many domestic perspectives.

29:05.858 --> 29:07.224
That's ancient thinking.

29:07.351 --> 29:08.652
This is getting quite long.

29:08.799 --> 29:10.819
My thinking has evolved this year.

29:11.400 --> 29:12.950
Accepting change
is the right way.

29:13.201 --> 29:15.002
I'm glad Guan Ji recruited you.

29:15.120 --> 29:16.625
There are definitely plenty of opportunities

29:16.743 --> 29:18.242
for us to ask for your advice.

29:18.457 --> 29:19.585
Mr. Shi, you flatter me.

29:19.789 --> 29:21.362
Yunchuang's future is limitless.

29:21.720 --> 29:23.180
We can learn from each other.

29:27.519 --> 29:28.579
By the way,

29:28.680 --> 29:30.440
Some time ago, I read an article

29:30.520 --> 29:32.602
"Zhu Xing Guo's Opinion
on the Currency War."

29:32.738 --> 29:33.738
The viewing angles are sharp.

29:33.848 --> 29:36.642
His writing is insightful and deep.
That's quite inspiring.

29:36.817 --> 29:39.697
You might want to take a look
if you have time.

29:40.168 --> 29:42.048
I remember the article vaguely.

29:42.145 --> 29:43.562
It's well written.

29:43.680 --> 29:44.779
Cheers.

29:45.400 --> 29:48.100
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I ask for your attention?

29:48.916 --> 29:50.396
Today we gather here,

29:50.536 --> 29:52.856
and all of you
are old friends of Guan Capital.

29:52.952 --> 29:55.552
Towards the end of the year,
I held this banquet

29:55.719 --> 29:58.430
as a token of thanks
for our sincere cooperation.

29:58.600 --> 30:02.350
We want to officially introduce new friends at once.

30:03.039 --> 30:04.800
Our strategic advisor,

30:05.003 --> 30:07.480
Mr Yu You, a finance professor.

30:14.839 --> 30:15.940
Thank You.

30:16.519 --> 30:17.519
Cheers.

30:21.809 --> 30:22.910
Enjoy the banquet.

30:26.482 --> 30:28.908
-Allow me to introduce...
-No need.

30:34.297 --> 30:36.161
Yu You, you don't know

30:36.304 --> 30:38.202
he's been wanting to meet you for a long time.

30:38.393 --> 30:41.522
I've never seen him
so crazy about a girl.

30:42.799 --> 30:44.059
You flatter me, Mr Shi.

30:45.539 --> 30:46.546
Okay.

30:46.658 --> 30:48.168
We have completed this great task

30:48.344 --> 30:49.922
and I've
got a great expert for you.

30:50.119 --> 30:52.882
My dad supports us, that's for sure.

30:53.009 --> 30:56.758
Next, win the favor of
the old people in Yunchuang.

30:57.119 --> 30:59.082
As for your father, do you want...

30:59.384 --> 31:01.495
No need to rush,
let's take it slow.

31:02.293 --> 31:03.352
Correct.

31:03.896 --> 31:06.664
Now we can call ourselves
the three minions...

31:06.774 --> 31:08.565
I'm not a lackey like you.

31:11.320 --> 31:14.642
Correct. We are like
the Jiangcheng Triad,

31:14.757 --> 31:16.882
unstoppable with our intelligence.

31:18.640 --> 31:19.660
Cheers.

31:46.545 --> 31:48.242
Xing Zhou, where are you?

31:48.359 --> 31:50.042
(The road is jammed.
Give me a little more time.)

31:50.144 --> 31:51.642
(I'll be there as soon as possible.)

31:51.799 --> 31:53.879
OK, I'll wait
by the side of the road,

31:53.968 --> 31:55.799
so you don't need to look for me.

32:07.760 --> 32:09.839
Ms. Zheng, long time no see.

32:09.920 --> 32:11.420
What are you doing here?

32:12.559 --> 32:13.944
Long time no see, Mr Zhang.

32:14.025 --> 32:16.042
I'm here for an interview.

32:16.279 --> 32:20.320
I haven't had time to thank you
properly

32:20.401 --> 32:22.482
for the wonderful article
you wrote for me last time.

32:22.568 --> 32:24.077
How about I give you a ride?

32:24.193 --> 32:25.392
Mr. Zhang, you are too kind.

32:25.473 --> 32:26.594
You have a lot of experience

32:26.720 --> 32:28.162
which gives me room to shine.

32:28.265 --> 32:29.515
My boyfriend will be here soon.

32:29.603 --> 32:30.884
No need to trouble you.

32:30.989 --> 32:33.258
Well, take care of yourself.

32:35.200 --> 32:37.670
Miss, are you alone?

32:38.488 --> 32:39.998
Want me to give you a ride?

32:40.136 --> 32:42.606
It was raining heavily and it was difficult to get a taxi.

32:43.188 --> 32:45.648
No, thank you.
My boyfriend will be here soon.

32:45.808 --> 32:48.229
Why are you standing here alone
if you have a girlfriend?

32:49.640 --> 32:52.150
Who says having a girlfriend
means you can't stand here?

32:59.417 --> 33:01.766
Why Ms. Zheng is still here?

33:06.799 --> 33:09.019
Didn't you prepare a car for him?

33:09.645 --> 33:11.483
He said someone picked him up.

33:59.680 --> 34:01.920
How much longer, Xing Zhou?

34:02.015 --> 34:03.274
I am cold.

34:04.720 --> 34:07.910
Maybe that person didn't have time?

34:08.064 --> 34:10.294
Right now, along this road,

34:10.457 --> 34:11.962
and heavy rain,

34:12.079 --> 34:13.802
difficult to get a taxi.

34:14.393 --> 34:15.667
Step aside.

34:20.799 --> 34:22.759
I know it's raining hard,
but I'm waiting for my boyfriend.

34:22.840 --> 34:25.589
Correct. I have a girlfriend.
Thank you and good bye.

34:34.361 --> 34:36.003
It can't be him, right?

34:40.480 --> 34:41.579
Road.

34:55.840 --> 34:57.989
He was really waiting for his girlfriend.

34:58.079 --> 34:59.400
I didn't think so

34:59.480 --> 35:01.470
he actually has a girlfriend.

35:02.113 --> 35:04.713
I spoke to him several times
by telephone

35:04.902 --> 35:07.181
and I think he's quite easy to get along with.

35:07.319 --> 35:09.598
Maybe because he failed the interview
today

35:09.679 --> 35:12.159
and there are people trying to chat
with him all day,

35:12.239 --> 35:13.722
Plus the weather is very cold,

35:13.803 --> 35:16.592
so he was a bit impatient.

35:17.826 --> 35:20.509
You seem quite worried about
whether he has a girlfriend or not.

35:21.056 --> 35:22.075
No.

35:22.180 --> 35:24.562
I think she is very beautiful,

35:24.643 --> 35:26.482
and he is competent at his job.

35:26.920 --> 35:29.989
It's natural that he has a girlfriend.

35:31.640 --> 35:33.361
So, you think she's beautiful

35:33.592 --> 35:34.720
and competent in their work?

35:34.840 --> 35:37.799
What we can be certain of is. Internally,
they have high expectations

35:37.880 --> 35:39.198
if he will pass the position

35:39.279 --> 35:40.950
and got the position of deputy editor.

35:42.599 --> 35:45.999
-Chen Sheng, I noticed something.
-What's that?

35:46.079 --> 35:47.720
You seem more talented

35:47.854 --> 35:49.954
become a gossip columnist
instead of being my assistant.

36:09.207 --> 36:10.288
I'm sorry, Shu Yi.

36:10.400 --> 36:12.360
Today it is raining heavily and the traffic jam is serious.

36:12.440 --> 36:13.920
I'm stuck in traffic.

36:13.993 --> 36:16.373
-You must be cold.
-I'm fine.

36:17.320 --> 36:18.880
How was your birthday today?

36:18.960 --> 36:20.059
Are you having fun?

36:21.480 --> 36:24.282
My boyfriend didn't even celebrate with me.
How can I be happy?

36:24.920 --> 36:26.300
Forgive me.

36:31.007 --> 36:33.122
Who is celebrating with you
today?

36:33.562 --> 36:34.743
Who else?

36:34.840 --> 36:35.985
Xu Feng?

36:38.039 --> 36:40.109
He even wears cologne now.

36:42.832 --> 36:44.920
The aroma is light and unique.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.280
The taste is not bad.

36:46.360 --> 36:47.653
If you meet him again,

36:47.734 --> 36:49.800
ask him what cologne
he uses.

36:49.880 --> 36:52.139
I think it suits you too.

36:53.079 --> 36:54.579
How was the interview today?

36:56.039 --> 36:57.589
Long story.

36:58.079 --> 37:00.910
Don't talk about it.
Irritating.

37:01.189 --> 37:03.340
Well, don't be mad, honey.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.259
Why didn't you answer my call?

37:14.856 --> 37:16.576
I'm all yours after work.

37:16.686 --> 37:18.236
No telephones while working.

37:20.559 --> 37:21.720
Stop by later.

37:21.847 --> 37:23.676
I'll make you long life noodles.

37:24.413 --> 37:26.000
It doesn't matter. It is late

37:26.079 --> 37:27.861
and you're not feeling well.
Take it easy.

37:27.942 --> 37:30.008
There will be many opportunities
to make up for it.

37:30.559 --> 37:32.830
Why are you so considerate?

37:33.440 --> 37:35.940
It's because I love you, Stupid.

37:52.928 --> 37:54.448
It's still your birthday.

37:54.559 --> 37:55.880
Happy birthday, Xing Zhou.

37:55.960 --> 37:57.179
Thank you darling.

37:59.159 --> 38:00.420
I'm going home now.

38:23.695 --> 38:25.282
Hello. What is it?

38:26.588 --> 38:27.728
What?

38:56.560 --> 38:59.749
I have to tell Mrs. Yi.

39:09.320 --> 39:10.539
Where's my phone?

39:26.760 --> 39:27.941
Hospital?

39:29.079 --> 39:30.629
How could it be in the hospital?

39:32.046 --> 39:33.305
Was my phone stolen?

39:34.520 --> 39:37.219
I was obviously holding my phone
when I got into the car.

39:40.159 --> 39:42.589
What is Xing Zhou doing in the hospital?

39:43.320 --> 39:44.659
Is he sick?

39:46.291 --> 39:49.281
Did he have a car accident?

40:11.360 --> 40:12.870
He really is here.

40:24.392 --> 40:26.302
License plate with repeating numbers.

40:26.945 --> 40:28.495
Better not mess
with them.

40:52.199 --> 40:53.800
He might be her friend.

40:54.048 --> 40:56.281
Visiting friends in the hospital
at night is normal.
