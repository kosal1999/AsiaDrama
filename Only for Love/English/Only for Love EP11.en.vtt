01:31.442 --> 01:36.082
(Only For Love)

01:36.163 --> 01:39.122
(Episode 11)

01:40.462 --> 01:42.611
Hi, may I know who ordered this?

01:43.013 --> 01:44.202
Here.

01:50.204 --> 01:51.864
Well, someone here wants cake.

01:55.297 --> 01:59.202
(Shi Yan, I can't believe you're subtly mocking me here.)

02:16.540 --> 02:17.962
Hurry up and eat.

02:37.445 --> 02:39.419
Wait for me. I'm going to say hi to Uncle Cheng.

02:39.500 --> 02:40.762
Okay.

02:42.579 --> 02:45.319
Looks like Shi Yan finally found a new girlfriend.

02:45.520 --> 02:48.280
I heard that he was devastated after Bei Lin dumped him.

02:48.404 --> 02:49.904
That's why he left Mingyu.

02:50.064 --> 02:53.923
That's how the nickname "Mingyu Runaway Prince" came about.

02:54.059 --> 02:55.260
That's not right.

02:55.348 --> 02:57.311
Shi Yan left Mingyu at the most critical time.

02:57.392 --> 02:59.832
Bei Lin dumped him because she thought he wasn't responsible.

03:00.899 --> 03:02.339
Do you think that girl

03:02.440 --> 03:04.861
knows all the things that happened to Shi Yan?

03:05.040 --> 03:06.760
Why does it matter?

03:06.870 --> 03:08.270
Everyone takes what they need.

03:08.393 --> 03:11.388
Do you think the girl fell for Shi Yan solely because of his handsome looks

03:11.412 --> 03:13.792
and not his background or wealth?

03:13.965 --> 03:15.282
Makes sense.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.169
When did you come back?

03:23.920 --> 03:25.162
Just now.

03:26.560 --> 03:28.100
Really? Just now?

03:33.960 --> 03:37.020
What's up? Do you want to eat or drink something?

03:38.352 --> 03:40.562
I'm tired. Let's go back.

03:41.179 --> 03:42.482
Let's go.

03:52.739 --> 03:54.499
Let's send Miss Zheng home first.

03:54.619 --> 03:55.922
Okay, Mr. Shi.

04:03.963 --> 04:07.322
Looks like Shi Yan finally found a new girlfriend.

04:07.403 --> 04:10.263
What does it have to do with you if he finds a girlfriend?

04:10.956 --> 04:13.556
I heard that he was devastated after Bei Lin dumped him.

04:13.692 --> 04:15.092
That's why he left Mingyu.

04:15.173 --> 04:16.773
What kind of nonsense are you talking?

04:16.880 --> 04:20.000
He was full of ambition and left to start his own business.

04:20.561 --> 04:24.280
That's how the nickname "Mingyu Runaway Prince" came about.

04:24.385 --> 04:26.642
Did you see him run away with your own eyes?

04:26.760 --> 04:28.880
Can't you see him?

04:28.960 --> 04:31.198
That's not right. The version I heard was Shi Yan left Mingyu

04:31.222 --> 04:32.397
at the most critical time.

04:32.478 --> 04:35.179
Bei Lin dumped him because she thought he wasn't responsible.

04:35.860 --> 04:37.339
Did you hide under his bed?

04:37.420 --> 04:39.060
How did you know who was being dumped?

04:39.141 --> 04:41.564
What do you mean by not responsible? He was obviously shouldering

04:41.588 --> 04:43.548
the responsibility of the whole Mingyu Yunchuang.

04:44.940 --> 04:46.419
Do you think that girl

04:46.539 --> 04:49.159
knows all the things that happened to Shi Yan?

04:49.560 --> 04:52.219
That's none of your business.

04:52.659 --> 04:54.260
What does it matter?

04:54.356 --> 04:55.935
Everyone takes what they need.

04:56.339 --> 04:58.299
Do you think that girl fell for Shi Yan solely

04:58.380 --> 04:59.541
because of his handsome looks

04:59.622 --> 05:01.942
and not his background or wealth?

05:02.023 --> 05:03.523
I don't believe it.

05:04.160 --> 05:07.120
Why can't I fall for Shi Yan's handsome looks?

05:07.252 --> 05:10.313
Even if I'm after his money, what does it have to do with you?

05:32.226 --> 05:34.124
Thanks for treating me to dinner today, Mr. Shi.

05:34.148 --> 05:35.648
I'm going home first.

05:43.296 --> 05:44.682
Zheng Shu Yi.

05:50.692 --> 05:52.922
I'm calling you. Didn't you hear me?

05:53.899 --> 05:55.399
I heard you.

05:56.221 --> 05:57.721
Are you in such a hurry to go home?

05:59.140 --> 06:00.562
No, not really.

06:01.732 --> 06:05.282
Are you in a hurry to go home to bake small cakes?

06:07.413 --> 06:08.913
Shi Yan.

06:09.308 --> 06:10.967
You're so annoying.

06:15.038 --> 06:17.602
You stopped me just to say that?

06:17.932 --> 06:19.472
What else do you want to hear?

06:24.398 --> 06:25.898
Why aren't you happy?

06:29.419 --> 06:30.762
Nothing.

06:32.541 --> 06:35.976
So, what did you gain from tonight's dinner?

06:38.219 --> 06:41.479
I did hear some things about you, Mr. Shi.

06:45.579 --> 06:48.562
So, do you believe it?

06:51.755 --> 06:53.255
Of course, I don't.

06:53.820 --> 06:55.720
I only believe what you tell me.

06:57.970 --> 06:59.751
So, do you want to know more about me?

07:01.600 --> 07:03.002
Can't I?

07:15.219 --> 07:17.369
So, you're not in a hurry to go home.

07:18.758 --> 07:20.122
I'm not in a hurry.

07:44.917 --> 07:46.602
What do you want me to say?

07:46.720 --> 07:48.840
Isn't what they said quite complete?

07:48.956 --> 07:50.836
My past experiences,

07:50.917 --> 07:52.562
from life to work,

07:52.651 --> 07:54.151
they talked about everything.

07:56.693 --> 07:59.402
(So, he heard it all.)

08:04.040 --> 08:06.759
Did they hide under your table or under your bed?

08:06.840 --> 08:08.881
How could they know everything about you?

08:09.092 --> 08:13.051
If we can judge a person just by hearsay and a few meetings,

08:13.219 --> 08:15.539
then I can also say, in my eyes,

08:15.619 --> 08:17.140
you are a wise and far-sighted,

08:17.253 --> 08:19.753
excellent and handsome young entrepreneur.

08:25.891 --> 08:27.881
I wouldn't know that if you didn't say it.

08:28.125 --> 08:30.194
So, I'm so excellent in your eyes?

08:33.412 --> 08:35.611
I'm just giving an example.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.336
It's not clear to me who you really are.

08:44.372 --> 08:45.953
Is it clearer now?

09:18.972 --> 09:20.593
You can't park here.

09:35.560 --> 09:38.880
Miss Zheng, are you okay?

09:42.000 --> 09:43.362
I'm fine.

10:00.380 --> 10:02.289
(Please enter the password.)

10:03.053 --> 10:04.592
(Door is opened.)

10:21.019 --> 10:22.322
Seven.

10:24.669 --> 10:26.328
Don't stand there. Hurry up and go.

10:29.360 --> 10:32.980
Mr. Shi, do I need to send the clothes in the trunk to Miss Zheng?

10:33.652 --> 10:35.482
No need. Let's go.

10:57.644 --> 10:59.484
(Shu Yi, what are you talking about?)

10:59.573 --> 11:00.933
(Have you been drinking too much?)

11:00.979 --> 11:02.842
(Shu Yi, are you okay?)

11:05.884 --> 11:07.045
(What's wrong with you?)

11:07.200 --> 11:08.915
(Don't you know that lightning could strike you)

11:08.939 --> 11:10.519
(for disturbing people so late?)

11:25.485 --> 11:26.804
You did well.

11:26.913 --> 11:30.413
You must let him know that there are other guys who are after you.

11:30.999 --> 11:33.802
Don't you see that he's falling for it?

11:33.960 --> 11:36.882
Otherwise, why would he be implying things to you, all right?

11:38.220 --> 11:41.941
I guess he will dream of you tonight.

11:43.400 --> 11:45.880
(But you must not give him any response.)

11:46.040 --> 11:48.359
We should keep him guessing.

11:48.539 --> 11:51.539
Let him take the initiative to find and chase you.

11:51.650 --> 11:52.810
Listen to me.

11:52.900 --> 11:55.562
Don't worry about what he thinks of you.

11:55.844 --> 11:57.205
What is the nature of men?

11:57.325 --> 11:58.962
It's conquering.

11:59.243 --> 12:01.963
If you don't have someone chasing you, or if you're too easy to get,

12:02.003 --> 12:03.824
(he won't treasure you.)

12:03.927 --> 12:06.637
You have to find a way to make him take the initiative.

12:07.348 --> 12:09.962
What for you pursue him unilaterally?

12:11.620 --> 12:13.120
(Then, what?)

12:14.360 --> 12:16.002
Then...

12:25.220 --> 12:27.215
Then, I called you.

12:28.620 --> 12:31.279
Nothing happened after that?

12:32.580 --> 12:34.322
So, he sent you home.

12:34.429 --> 12:36.610
(But nothing happened between you two.)

12:37.860 --> 12:39.439
Then, I went home.

12:48.220 --> 12:50.720
All right then. I won't chat with you now.

12:50.995 --> 12:52.495
I still have something to do here.

13:03.220 --> 13:04.620
(Wait and see.)

13:04.740 --> 13:06.279
(Keep a distance.)

13:29.380 --> 13:30.880
Wine is not bad.

13:31.886 --> 13:33.626
The wine glass is too cold.

13:36.619 --> 13:38.139
You have so many tricks.

13:38.252 --> 13:40.212
Aren't you afraid someone will be sincere to you?

13:43.403 --> 13:44.903
It's best not to.

13:56.604 --> 13:58.216
He can't get out of it.

14:15.077 --> 14:16.116
You...

14:16.244 --> 14:17.405
What's wrong?

14:17.485 --> 14:18.985
Nothing.

14:36.380 --> 14:37.880
I'm fine.

14:40.635 --> 14:42.135
What are you doing?

14:42.652 --> 14:44.336
Let me get changed. I'll take you to the hospital.

14:44.360 --> 14:45.722
I'm not going.

14:46.285 --> 14:47.785
It's swollen.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.301
I have an appointment tomorrow.

14:57.843 --> 14:58.843
Hello?

14:58.960 --> 15:00.460
Send me some band-aids. I...

15:18.740 --> 15:22.482
Unilateral efforts are indeed meaningless.

15:24.819 --> 15:26.602
With what happened today,

15:26.819 --> 15:29.080
I don't even know what he wants.

15:31.011 --> 15:32.171
Actually, everyone knows that

15:32.260 --> 15:34.531
more efficient and safer batteries are always

15:34.612 --> 15:37.045
the pain points for the development of the new energy vehicle industry.

15:37.069 --> 15:40.725
So, finding a battery enterprise with potential for long-term development

15:40.876 --> 15:43.642
is the most important key for us to enter this line of business.

15:44.132 --> 15:46.771
Zhanlan's market share is high now.

15:46.852 --> 15:48.214
After this round of financing,

15:48.314 --> 15:50.095
it will definitely go up another level.

15:50.960 --> 15:52.980
Zhanlan is indeed a good choice,

15:53.085 --> 15:54.364
but the competition is fierce.

15:54.480 --> 15:57.701
Many companies are now confident of their success.

15:58.515 --> 16:01.395
Zhanlan is in a leading position in the industry,

16:01.499 --> 16:03.259
but can they break through

16:03.340 --> 16:05.460
the technical difficulty of all-solid-state batteries

16:05.595 --> 16:07.156
and continue to lead the industry?

16:07.340 --> 16:11.802
Mr. Shi, it's definitely right to have a long-term vision.

16:12.093 --> 16:15.933
But there is no better choice than Zhanlan right now.

16:16.060 --> 16:19.440
Are you a bit too pessimistic?

16:26.722 --> 16:28.097
What does the Evaluation Department think?

16:28.121 --> 16:31.641
It is indeed risky for Yunchuang to make such a large investment.

16:31.819 --> 16:34.162
But we have done detailed calculations.

16:34.271 --> 16:36.351
Based on Zhanlan's current profitability,

16:36.457 --> 16:38.977
we believe it is a worthwhile investment opportunity.

16:39.912 --> 16:42.991
The prospects for solid-state batteries are indeed very promising.

16:43.178 --> 16:44.955
But the research and development cycle is long

16:44.979 --> 16:46.402
and the cost is huge,

16:46.494 --> 16:47.933
so we need to be careful.

16:48.023 --> 16:49.742
If we want to take down Zhanlan,

16:50.019 --> 16:51.962
we still need to do more work.

16:52.469 --> 16:55.340
But I think we can still try our best.

16:55.440 --> 16:58.720
Everybody, Zhanlan is at the forefront of solid-state battery innovation.

16:58.828 --> 17:00.105
With our help,

17:00.186 --> 17:02.751
it is possible to quickly pull away from other companies

17:02.832 --> 17:04.698
and become the industry leader.

17:05.039 --> 17:07.282
So I'm very optimistic about it.

17:07.666 --> 17:10.482
But since Mr. Shi has concerns,

17:10.688 --> 17:12.889
we can shorten the investment cycle.

17:13.012 --> 17:14.512
We can cash out quickly.

17:23.040 --> 17:25.034
Since everyone is optimistic about this line of business,

17:25.058 --> 17:27.720
let's keep pushing forward the research and evaluation work

17:27.825 --> 17:29.926
to determine the direction for the next step.

17:31.280 --> 17:33.619
Let's end it here for today. Dismissed.

17:37.793 --> 17:40.573
Uncle Tian and Uncle Zhang are acting a bit strange today.

17:41.262 --> 17:42.741
It's not hard to understand.

17:42.822 --> 17:45.543
Short-term large investments may bring high returns.

17:45.680 --> 17:48.482
No investment company would give up this opportunity.

17:48.563 --> 17:50.983
That's why we have so many competitors.

17:51.629 --> 17:53.539
That's their true face.

17:54.600 --> 17:57.281
Zhanlan is the leader in the semi-solid battery field.

17:57.520 --> 18:00.080
I've seen the report. They do have a lot of orders.

18:00.214 --> 18:03.570
But their factories are all producing at an overload.

18:03.680 --> 18:06.400
So, I guess the investment they got this round

18:06.526 --> 18:09.206
will be spent on expanding production

18:09.316 --> 18:11.356
rather than on technology research and development.

18:12.454 --> 18:13.727
This possibility is very high.

18:13.832 --> 18:15.769
After all, maintaining and expanding market shares

18:15.793 --> 18:17.613
is the primary goal for many companies.

18:19.629 --> 18:21.369
What's the next step?

18:22.565 --> 18:24.366
The report is all about the past.

18:24.486 --> 18:26.926
I need to see the current situation with my own eyes.

18:27.022 --> 18:29.282
So, I'll go and investigate in person.

18:29.459 --> 18:30.602
Shi Yan.

18:31.472 --> 18:32.962
I have an idea.

18:35.320 --> 18:36.820
We can start preparing.

18:39.421 --> 18:41.601
No. What are you two talking about?

18:42.059 --> 18:43.322
Shi Yan.

18:44.147 --> 18:46.341
(Yi, have you eaten?)

18:47.309 --> 18:48.768
(How have you been lately?)

18:48.860 --> 18:50.260
(Are you busy with work?)

18:50.380 --> 18:51.642
It's okay.

18:52.101 --> 18:54.410
(Do you have time this weekend?)

18:55.920 --> 18:58.501
Mom, why do I feel like something's off with you?

18:58.911 --> 19:01.642
Nothing's off with me. No manners!

19:01.723 --> 19:03.883
I'm just concerned about you.

19:03.969 --> 19:06.929
(You're concerned about the future, the things that haven't happened yet.)

19:08.781 --> 19:10.050
As the saying goes,

19:10.131 --> 19:11.932
don't be too attached to the past.

19:12.013 --> 19:16.003
(The future is what we should really cherish.)

19:16.541 --> 19:17.661
Do.

19:17.758 --> 19:20.361
Do you still remember what I told you last time

19:20.442 --> 19:22.282
about the son of our dean,

19:22.383 --> 19:24.402
(the one who studied abroad)

19:24.501 --> 19:26.642
(and is now back in Jiangcheng?)

19:26.780 --> 19:28.922
Why don't you go and meet him this weekend,

19:29.083 --> 19:31.865
get to know him, and then hang out together?

19:32.860 --> 19:35.802
Are you trying to arrange a date for me?

19:35.883 --> 19:37.282
(Not at all.)

19:37.391 --> 19:39.171
It's just making friends.

19:39.548 --> 19:42.148
Don't young people nowadays prefer

19:42.264 --> 19:44.583
socializing online and then going out?

19:44.739 --> 19:45.819
(Listen.)

19:45.939 --> 19:48.282
(This boy is quite handsome.)

19:48.494 --> 19:52.274
I'm not doing this because of his education or family background.

19:52.934 --> 19:55.253
So, you're doing this because of his looks.

19:55.388 --> 19:56.708
(If you like him, )

19:56.821 --> 19:58.522
(just go out with him.)

19:58.692 --> 20:01.134
Why do you talk to your mom like this?

20:01.238 --> 20:02.682
No manners.

20:03.700 --> 20:04.780
Do.

20:04.861 --> 20:06.221
You're still young.

20:06.340 --> 20:08.060
You can't stay single for too long.

20:08.141 --> 20:10.306
(Staying single for too long will become a habit.)

20:10.387 --> 20:13.082
(Your love life will go downhill.)

20:13.277 --> 20:16.146
I'm giving you advice.

20:17.580 --> 20:19.482
I really don't need it.

20:19.632 --> 20:22.533
(So, say it. What kind of guys do you like?)

20:25.348 --> 20:26.548
He has to be older than me,

20:26.668 --> 20:28.109
at least 27.

20:28.249 --> 20:30.642
(Not too tall, but not too short either, )

20:30.723 --> 20:32.162
around 183 cm.

20:32.376 --> 20:35.196
It's best if he works in finance, so we'll have things to talk about.

20:35.997 --> 20:39.187
Coincidentally, he fits your requirements perfectly.

20:40.659 --> 20:41.962
No way!

20:42.960 --> 20:45.400
Don't tell me that his name is made up of two characters too.

20:47.470 --> 20:49.142
You guessed it right!

20:49.360 --> 20:51.760
(I'm sending his WeChat to you now.)

20:51.924 --> 20:52.925
Add him.

20:53.006 --> 20:54.886
There are pictures on his WeChat.

20:55.040 --> 20:56.200
Take a look and you'll know

20:56.326 --> 20:58.236
if what I said about him is accurate.

20:58.581 --> 21:00.701
(If you don't think you guys are suitable...)

21:00.817 --> 21:02.818
Can you just stop introducing guys to me again?

21:02.907 --> 21:04.376
Oh, it's all right if it's not suitable.

21:04.400 --> 21:05.881
I will keep introducing

21:06.060 --> 21:09.010
(until you're satisfied.)

21:16.860 --> 21:19.239
(How about it? Is it good?)

21:22.304 --> 21:24.042
All right then.

21:24.123 --> 21:25.902
I'm going to meet a new friend then.

21:26.380 --> 21:28.381
As I told you, this guy is pretty good, right?

21:28.462 --> 21:30.651
Remember to go to the meeting on the weekend, alright?

21:32.020 --> 21:33.322
Meeting.

21:33.576 --> 21:36.037
Mom, I'm hanging up now. I have to go to a meeting.

21:39.669 --> 21:40.930
Shu Yi.

21:41.269 --> 21:42.508
Yu Ling.

21:42.640 --> 21:45.082
You two have attended Yunchuang's press conference before.

21:45.256 --> 21:48.729
The year-end cover for next month will be entrusted to you two.

21:48.810 --> 21:50.730
I hope you two can work together

21:50.931 --> 21:53.922
to give Financial Introduce a good ending this year.

21:59.749 --> 22:01.249
That's settled then.

22:01.360 --> 22:03.541
Shu Yi, you're in charge of finalizing the article.

22:05.340 --> 22:07.330
Do you two have any other questions?

22:07.580 --> 22:08.842
No.

22:10.020 --> 22:12.020
Everyone has been doing great lately.

22:12.101 --> 22:13.421
Keep up the good work.

22:13.502 --> 22:15.461
There are only two more issues left this year.

22:15.659 --> 22:16.700
Don't slack off.

22:16.800 --> 22:20.070
Put in more effort. Then, have a great new year ahead.

22:20.219 --> 22:21.882
All right. Dismissed.

22:26.269 --> 22:27.348
Shu Yi.

22:27.429 --> 22:28.929
Come to my office.

22:36.419 --> 22:38.239
You've been doing well lately.

22:38.511 --> 22:40.682
The editor-in-chief and I have high hopes for you.

22:41.010 --> 22:43.832
The deputy editor position has been empty for a while.

22:43.924 --> 22:45.162
Work hard

22:45.644 --> 22:47.084
and try to surpass me.

22:47.243 --> 22:49.700
Ms. Yi, you know that this is not my end goal.

22:49.844 --> 22:50.964
Shu Yi.

22:51.076 --> 22:52.636
No matter what form it takes,

22:52.749 --> 22:54.419
the most important thing is the article itself.

22:54.443 --> 22:56.643
A good article is the same no matter where it's placed.

22:56.961 --> 22:59.162
But articles and interviews have time limits.

22:59.277 --> 23:01.267
Interaction with the readers is also important.

23:02.540 --> 23:04.539
The editor-in-chief has his own considerations.

23:04.640 --> 23:06.136
Regarding the current state of print media,

23:06.160 --> 23:08.227
we in Financial Introduce have already made our calculations.

23:08.251 --> 23:09.939
If we add more people and budget,

23:10.020 --> 23:11.819
it would be difficult for him.

23:11.915 --> 23:15.322
This is exactly why I want to promote a digital magazine.

23:15.426 --> 23:17.882
I want to meet the readers' needs and reading habits.

23:17.963 --> 23:19.882
It might be a new way out.

23:20.596 --> 23:22.035
I understand your point.

23:22.132 --> 23:25.322
But the reality is that Financial Introduce is a monthly magazine.

23:25.403 --> 23:27.231
Our current structure is just right.

23:27.311 --> 23:30.220
If we put all our energy into the digital magazine,

23:30.340 --> 23:31.661
we would need a lot of articles,

23:31.828 --> 23:33.996
and we would need more manpower and financial resources

23:34.020 --> 23:35.539
to make it happen.

23:35.620 --> 23:36.922
I get it.

23:37.636 --> 23:39.476
That's why I wanted to try it.

23:39.580 --> 23:41.837
I can write articles for both paper and digital magazines.

23:41.861 --> 23:43.901
I can do both with the current team.

23:43.982 --> 23:45.595
Finish the work for this year first.

23:45.676 --> 23:48.220
Then, think carefully about the new-year cover next year.

23:48.301 --> 23:49.356
If you do it well,

23:49.436 --> 23:52.772
I will try to talk to the editor-in-chief about the digital magazine.

23:54.325 --> 23:55.722
Thank you, Ms. Yi.

24:11.340 --> 24:12.602
Professor Yu.

24:13.498 --> 24:15.609
I didn't expect you to be my date.

24:15.820 --> 24:17.042
Shu Yi.

24:17.594 --> 24:18.729
Sit.

24:22.082 --> 24:25.449
So, you already knew that I was your date?

24:26.200 --> 24:29.230
As soon as I saw it was you I felt relieved immediately.

24:31.020 --> 24:33.250
You even dressed up.

24:35.620 --> 24:38.461
Since it's a date with a professor, I had to dress up

24:38.568 --> 24:40.107
at least out of respect.

24:40.308 --> 24:41.338
Since you knew it was me,

24:41.419 --> 24:43.402
why didn't you tell me earlier through WeChat?

24:43.996 --> 24:45.535
My mom is a crafty one.

24:45.636 --> 24:46.700
If I had talked to you,

24:46.781 --> 24:48.762
she would have asked to see the chat log,

24:48.843 --> 24:51.323
and then she would have known that we already knew each other.

24:51.739 --> 24:53.635
What would you like to drink? I'll order for you.

24:53.659 --> 24:55.002
Anything is fine.

24:55.219 --> 24:56.442
Waitress.

25:30.085 --> 25:31.445
(Does it look good?)

25:31.596 --> 25:33.442
(Give me a two-word answer.)

25:34.533 --> 25:35.842
(Looks okay.)

25:42.895 --> 25:45.800
(When will you come and take your things back?)

25:52.729 --> 25:54.652
Shu Yi. It's already this late.

25:54.760 --> 25:56.340
Let's have lunch together later.

25:57.259 --> 25:59.242
It's okay. I'm not hungry yet.

26:01.140 --> 26:02.540
I still have something to do later.

26:02.580 --> 26:04.340
I'll make an appointment with you next time.

26:04.979 --> 26:06.162
Okay.

26:17.797 --> 26:20.162
(What did I forget to bring back with me?)

26:20.596 --> 26:22.002
(Mr. Shi.)

26:25.519 --> 26:28.322
(Are you talking about my heart?)

26:33.457 --> 26:36.482
(The clothes you bought the day we went to the banquet.)

26:40.419 --> 26:41.999
I forgot all about it.

26:42.784 --> 26:45.485
Oh, snap. I can't return it if I wait any longer.

26:46.356 --> 26:47.682
(I've been too busy lately.)

26:47.780 --> 26:49.082
(I forgot.)

26:49.990 --> 26:51.842
(Can you help me deliver it, please?)

26:51.985 --> 26:53.226
(I need it urgently.)

26:53.307 --> 26:54.882
(Pretty please.)

27:03.076 --> 27:04.315
(I'm also very busy lately.)

27:04.396 --> 27:05.896
(I have no time to be a courier.)

27:16.836 --> 27:18.197
(What are you busy with?)

27:18.445 --> 27:19.762
(Making desserts?)

27:25.601 --> 27:27.631
Is this joke never going to go away?

27:32.381 --> 27:34.461
(I'll go get it now.)

27:34.560 --> 27:36.362
(Wait for me.)

27:39.033 --> 27:41.362
Excuse me, sir. I want to go to another place.

27:41.457 --> 27:42.802
Okay.

28:11.499 --> 28:12.682
Yue.

28:13.184 --> 28:14.884
Give your uncle a call.

28:15.419 --> 28:16.482
Okay.

28:36.899 --> 28:38.461
- Hello? - (Uncle.)

28:38.560 --> 28:40.602
(Dinner is ready. When are you coming back?)

28:40.738 --> 28:43.290
You guys go ahead and eat. I won't be coming back.

28:45.707 --> 28:48.602
Come back after you're done with your work. We can wait for you.

28:48.752 --> 28:50.202
It doesn't matter how late.

28:50.675 --> 28:51.996
You and Grandpa eat first.

28:52.140 --> 28:53.339
I have something to do.

28:53.521 --> 28:55.552
(But you need to eat too.)

28:57.659 --> 28:59.159
I'm already cooking.

28:59.452 --> 29:01.653
Grandpa. Uncle said he's already cooking.

29:01.761 --> 29:04.440
- He won't be coming back for dinner. - Give me the phone.

29:05.467 --> 29:06.682
Shi Yan.

29:07.780 --> 29:10.520
You haven't been home for dinner for quite a few days.

29:11.540 --> 29:13.530
Dad, I'll make time to come back in two days.

29:13.659 --> 29:14.819
(I heard)

29:14.954 --> 29:18.689
you've been seeing a female actress recently.

29:20.482 --> 29:22.122
Who told you that?

29:22.259 --> 29:25.159
You can't find the source for most rumors.

29:25.240 --> 29:28.242
Just answer me. Yes or no?

29:31.524 --> 29:34.123
No. She just wants to show off a bit.

29:34.321 --> 29:35.842
(Dad, I'm hanging up now.)

29:35.923 --> 29:37.423
(Something happened.)

29:38.774 --> 29:41.722
Grandpa. Uncle is really in love.

30:44.500 --> 30:46.922
Done with work? Where did you come from?

30:51.540 --> 30:52.922
Come in.

31:07.964 --> 31:09.682
So many dishes!

31:14.820 --> 31:16.362
(You're so silly.)

31:22.380 --> 31:23.420
Mr. Shi.

31:23.501 --> 31:25.920
I've been busy all day. I haven't even eaten yet.

31:28.892 --> 31:30.151
Look at this big table of dishes.

31:30.175 --> 31:31.675
You can't finish them all by yourself.

31:31.699 --> 31:33.122
It's too wasteful.

31:35.219 --> 31:36.682
If you don't want to waste it,

31:36.792 --> 31:38.482
sit down and eat it all.

31:44.240 --> 31:46.657
Thank you for the hospitality. I will definitely respect the food,

31:46.681 --> 31:48.281
and eat it all without leaving anything.

32:07.960 --> 32:09.820
That's so delicious!

32:10.903 --> 32:13.202
Which takeout is this? How come it tastes so good?

32:15.580 --> 32:17.159
It's a place you can't order from.

32:19.170 --> 32:20.962
Why do you look down on me?

32:24.820 --> 32:26.360
It's too delicious.

32:27.120 --> 32:29.579
If I could have this kind of food every time I wake up,

32:29.680 --> 32:31.180
that would be so blessed.

32:32.720 --> 32:34.220
It's not hard either.

32:35.419 --> 32:36.859
You're right, Mr. Shi.

32:37.018 --> 32:38.578
As long as I work hard,

32:38.698 --> 32:40.922
I can also afford such delicious food.

32:44.333 --> 32:45.722
So,

32:45.780 --> 32:47.420
what do you think about

32:47.501 --> 32:49.259
the Mingyu Yunchuang's special report

32:49.340 --> 32:50.700
that I mentioned to you before?

32:50.820 --> 32:52.882
Can we continue to push it forward?

32:53.269 --> 32:55.219
I don't talk about work during my private time.

33:03.101 --> 33:04.722
And, she said it's not hard.

33:05.268 --> 33:07.887
Don't talk while eating. This may cause indigestion.

33:16.780 --> 33:18.819
(Shu Yi. Do you have time now?)

33:19.017 --> 33:20.517
(Let's talk over the phone.)

33:25.380 --> 33:28.479
Looking at your phone while eating is bad for your stomach.

33:30.380 --> 33:33.449
(Ms. Yi. It's not convenient now. I'll call back later.)

33:56.219 --> 33:57.759
Mr. Shi, I'm done eating.

34:00.969 --> 34:03.990
Mr. Shi, where's my stuff?

34:35.739 --> 34:37.002
Here you go.

34:38.048 --> 34:39.548
Thank you, Mr. Shi.

34:40.360 --> 34:42.119
- Zheng Shu Yi. - No need to see me off.

34:42.215 --> 34:43.482
Goodbye, Mr. Shi.

34:50.040 --> 34:52.600
You really love taking things and hanging around for free meals.

34:53.579 --> 34:55.109
(Shu Yi, in two days, there will be)

34:55.200 --> 34:57.007
(an international industry forum in Wucheng.)

34:57.100 --> 34:58.600
(You should attend the event.)

34:59.020 --> 35:00.722
Okay, I'll set off tomorrow.

35:00.832 --> 35:02.332
(Thanks for your hard work.)

35:11.381 --> 35:12.562
Shan Shan.

35:12.681 --> 35:15.072
I've visited Bogang Yunwan three times.

35:32.975 --> 35:34.618
Shan Shan, this way.

35:35.964 --> 35:38.003
Sorry for being late.

35:38.129 --> 35:39.168
Come here. Have a drink.

35:39.249 --> 35:41.129
- You should be punished with a drink. - Okay.

35:41.227 --> 35:42.267
- Fill it up. - Come on.

35:42.308 --> 35:43.349
Fill it up.

35:43.480 --> 35:44.980
Excuse me for a moment.

35:45.847 --> 35:47.762
- Great! - You're a good drinker.

35:47.859 --> 35:49.359
Not bad.

35:49.446 --> 35:50.846
- Hello. - Long time no see.

35:50.927 --> 35:52.987
- Hello. - Hi.

35:53.344 --> 35:54.919
Shan Shan. You know him, right?

35:55.000 --> 35:56.275
The prince from the Guan family.

35:56.299 --> 35:58.179
The CEO of Guan Capital.

35:58.299 --> 36:02.410
I met him once at the press conference.

36:03.560 --> 36:06.400
Shan Shan is a beautiful journalist from Interactive Entertainment Net.

36:07.739 --> 36:08.922
Miss Bi

36:09.956 --> 36:12.386
looks even better in person than on camera.

36:13.345 --> 36:15.921
Shan Shan. You have to be careful.

36:16.059 --> 36:19.380
Mr. Guan is really a sweet-talker.

36:19.476 --> 36:21.396
He's a killer of beauties.

36:21.492 --> 36:23.231
But he's no match for me.

36:23.569 --> 36:24.969
I don't like sweet talk.

36:25.050 --> 36:26.682
I like spicy food.

36:29.100 --> 36:30.780
Come on. Let me treat everyone to a drink.

36:30.859 --> 36:33.242
- Come on. - Cheers.

36:43.996 --> 36:46.396
Qin Shi Yue really made a great contribution

36:46.501 --> 36:49.320
to Jiangcheng's with her own might.

36:54.699 --> 36:56.122
Hi there, delivery.

36:57.320 --> 36:59.300
Miss. Are you running an online store?

36:59.931 --> 37:01.491
No. I'm returning them.

37:01.620 --> 37:02.780
All of them?

37:02.880 --> 37:05.079
What kind of store is this? The quality is so bad.

37:05.199 --> 37:06.658
I bought too much. Sorry to trouble you.

37:06.682 --> 37:07.882
Not at all.

37:16.480 --> 37:18.510
How can I get to know him?

37:19.379 --> 37:22.282
I should at least try to get his WeChat.

37:29.659 --> 37:31.202
Yue.

37:31.760 --> 37:33.681
Don't be lazy.

37:33.867 --> 37:36.362
I'm watching you on behalf of Shu Yi.

37:44.560 --> 37:46.139
I've wronged you.

37:46.660 --> 37:48.280
You're making quite a progress.

37:50.657 --> 37:52.378
Yu You is popular.

37:52.459 --> 37:53.738
He's worth studying.

37:53.819 --> 37:55.005
I remember Shu Yi seems to have

37:55.029 --> 37:57.768
gone to the University of Finance and Economics to interview him.

37:58.858 --> 37:59.939
Do more homework.

38:00.020 --> 38:01.719
It will be of great help in the future.

38:01.800 --> 38:04.400
Gone to the University of Finance and Economics to interview him?

38:10.039 --> 38:11.562
For us finance students,

38:11.664 --> 38:14.484
we all probably have a dream to become an investor.

38:14.651 --> 38:17.393
So, what's the most important thing for an investor?

38:17.581 --> 38:20.179
A very important key is to learn DD.

38:20.299 --> 38:21.380
What is DD?

38:21.480 --> 38:24.282
DD stands for due diligence.

38:24.420 --> 38:26.419
It's an investigation conducted by the investor

38:26.500 --> 38:27.859
and intermediary institutions,

38:27.940 --> 38:29.275
with the cooperation of the business,

38:29.299 --> 38:31.675
on aspects such as the business's historical data and documents,

38:31.699 --> 38:33.579
management background,

38:33.699 --> 38:37.380
market risks, management risks, technical risks, and capital risks.

38:37.461 --> 38:39.101
It's a comprehensive and in-depth review,

38:39.140 --> 38:41.322
and the cycle is usually three to six months.

38:41.540 --> 38:44.679
I didn't expect him not to wear a suit and still look so handsome.

38:45.140 --> 38:47.410
He's even more handsome than at the press conference.

38:48.261 --> 38:49.602
Oh, my God.

38:49.891 --> 38:52.881
Please give me such a university lecturer.

38:55.659 --> 38:57.519
For the recitation of the definitions,

38:57.600 --> 38:59.419
I believe everyone must feel that it's very boring.

38:59.443 --> 39:01.823
But the knowledge points just mentioned are very important,

39:01.964 --> 39:03.324
especially the four risks.

39:03.405 --> 39:04.565
Everyone must remember those.

39:04.640 --> 39:07.220
The next in-class test will definitely cover them.

39:07.540 --> 39:09.040
Hurry up and take note.

39:15.560 --> 39:18.860
For some things, just looking at the surface isn't enough.

39:18.956 --> 39:22.417
We need to investigate and understand more deeply and carefully.

39:23.400 --> 39:26.340
Where are we now?

39:28.259 --> 39:29.656
We just started with the definition,

39:29.680 --> 39:31.396
and it might seem a bit hard to understand.

39:31.420 --> 39:33.139
Let's simplify it a bit.

39:33.259 --> 39:35.259
Let's relate it to our daily lives.

39:35.379 --> 39:38.020
If you want to get to know someone you are not familiar with

39:38.101 --> 39:39.261
or don't yet know,

39:39.388 --> 39:44.380
we would certainly want to know as much as possible about him.

39:44.468 --> 39:46.147
At this time, everyone will definitely

39:46.240 --> 39:47.801
do some background checks

39:47.964 --> 39:50.123
from different dimensions and levels

39:50.259 --> 39:54.162
to understand the relevant information about this person in all aspects,

39:54.219 --> 39:55.659
so as to make up for the asymmetric

39:55.779 --> 39:57.779
and imperfect information between the two parties.

40:10.005 --> 40:11.162
That's it.

40:11.339 --> 40:13.096
If there's anything you don't understand, ask me.

40:13.120 --> 40:15.076
- Professor Yu, we're leaving. - Thank you, professor.

40:15.100 --> 40:16.920
- Bye. - Bye.

40:17.819 --> 40:19.049
Professor Yu.

40:20.060 --> 40:21.362
Professor Yu.

40:21.677 --> 40:23.378
Can I add you on WeChat?

40:25.100 --> 40:27.842
I want to ask you about some parts I don't understand.

40:28.056 --> 40:30.122
You can ask me whatever you don't understand now.

40:33.900 --> 40:35.400
Where don't you understand?

40:37.299 --> 40:39.480
Professor Yu. Don't you remember me?

40:39.748 --> 40:42.469
Last time, you helped me get coffee at the financial center

40:42.550 --> 40:44.442
during Yunchuang's press conference.

40:44.739 --> 40:46.980
I still remember. Is there something you need me for?

40:47.061 --> 40:48.561
I wanted to meet you!

40:50.620 --> 40:53.930
Last time, I didn't have the chance to add you on WeChat.

40:54.460 --> 40:56.402
You ran around half of Jiangcheng

40:56.748 --> 40:58.248
just to add me on WeChat?

40:59.060 --> 41:01.570
It's not just that.

41:01.950 --> 41:05.070
I'm an intern journalist for Financial Introduce.

41:05.259 --> 41:07.562
I just came here to learn.

41:08.132 --> 41:10.108
You're a journalist for Financial Introduce too?

41:10.189 --> 41:12.162
Yes. I'm an intern.

41:12.266 --> 41:13.847
Shu Yi is my supervisor.

41:14.659 --> 41:16.159
So, you're under Shu Yi?

41:18.780 --> 41:22.300
Can I come to your class next time?

41:22.699 --> 41:23.860
Yes.

41:23.980 --> 41:27.402
But, one thing. Don't fall asleep next time.

41:28.508 --> 41:29.802
I'm teaching finance.

41:29.940 --> 41:31.962
You can search for the learning materials online.

41:32.580 --> 41:34.059
If you can't find them,

41:34.140 --> 41:36.510
remember to tell me before the next class,

41:36.591 --> 41:37.962
and I'll help you prepare.

41:42.474 --> 41:43.762
What?

41:43.904 --> 41:46.534
You just ate and left with the bag?

41:47.020 --> 41:48.162
Right.

41:49.215 --> 41:51.322
(You're really something, Zheng Shu Yi.)

41:51.451 --> 41:54.402
But the editor was looking for me. What could I do?

41:54.690 --> 41:56.720
No wonder Shi Yan didn't take you seriously.

41:57.501 --> 41:59.451
So, what do you suggest I do now?

42:00.405 --> 42:01.728
Where are you now?

42:01.809 --> 42:03.682
(I'm on a business trip in Wucheng.)

42:05.379 --> 42:08.082
Okay. Take a picture and post it on your WeChat Moments.

42:08.299 --> 42:09.659
(What should I say?)

42:09.779 --> 42:11.279
Nothing.

42:11.770 --> 42:13.270
Nothing?

42:14.196 --> 42:15.362
(Just follow my lead.)

42:15.563 --> 42:17.283
If you've encountered anything interesting,

42:17.379 --> 42:19.289
remember to post it on your WeChat Moments.

42:20.040 --> 42:21.282
Got it.
