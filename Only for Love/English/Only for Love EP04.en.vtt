01:31.202 --> 01:36.002
(Just For Love)

01:36.027 --> 01:39.000
(Episode 4)

01:50.294 --> 01:51.542
I just heard something.

01:52.183 --> 01:54.629
Actually Xu Yu Ling went to
interview Fang Shi Yan yesterday.

01:57.004 --> 01:59.008
A moment. Why are you so calm?

01:59.294 --> 02:00.974
I went to the
editor's office this morning…

02:00.999 --> 02:02.902
and saw
Xu Yu Ling hand over the draft.

02:03.096 --> 02:04.615
I was thinking…

02:04.640 --> 02:06.783
no
interview task these two days either.

02:06.808 --> 02:08.214
Why did he submit the draft?

02:08.888 --> 02:11.193
Then, while
I was in the pantry earlier,

02:11.218 --> 02:14.331
I heard that he actually
went to interview Fang Shi Yan.

02:14.499 --> 02:16.202
You know what's
even more annoying?

02:16.227 --> 02:18.381
I've read
your interview outline, haven't I?

02:18.406 --> 02:20.919
He literally copied
your entire interview outline.

02:21.200 --> 02:22.827
What do you think all this is?

02:24.390 --> 02:25.750
For real.

02:42.387 --> 02:43.592
Tuan Shi.

02:43.617 --> 02:45.703
Did I say it wrong?

02:51.000 --> 02:54.125
I did not follow the framework and
interviewed question after question,

02:54.198 --> 02:56.995
but Shi Yan must have known it was
the same outline of the interview.

02:57.020 --> 02:59.292
And, he answered
the same question twice.

03:00.695 --> 03:03.129
Xu Yu Ling memang penipu.

03:03.992 --> 03:05.981
Yu Ling, you are so great.

03:06.006 --> 03:07.630
You can interview Shi Yan.

03:07.694 --> 03:09.689
Yes, Yu Ling, you are really great.

03:09.714 --> 03:12.002
Just a small thing.
You two, work hard.

03:12.592 --> 03:14.417
- Did you hear that?
- Loud and clear.

03:23.800 --> 03:27.204
The interview went awry and
the transcript of the interview was stolen.

03:27.317 --> 03:29.112
I was also played
while riding a horse.

03:29.793 --> 03:30.862
Oh God.

03:30.887 --> 03:33.820
How many embarrassing things
have I done in front of him?

03:34.484 --> 03:37.128
Actually, this Shi Yan was quite good.

03:37.701 --> 03:40.258
He was a busy man, but he
still received two interviews.

03:40.283 --> 03:41.792
He seems to be quite
patient with you.

03:45.589 --> 03:47.488
If you want to say that
the people are quite good.

03:47.513 --> 03:48.899
He holds a grudge.

03:48.924 --> 03:50.219
His mood changes quickly.

03:50.289 --> 03:52.079
He also likes to see
people doing embarrassing things.

03:52.104 --> 03:53.571
But, if you want to say that
the person is not good.

03:53.596 --> 03:54.989
He doesn't seem to have any malicious intent.

03:55.202 --> 03:57.622
But, when interviewed, you
don't know what he is thinking.

03:57.802 --> 04:00.414
He is a great actor.

04:00.498 --> 04:02.300
I do not understand this man.

04:19.112 --> 04:20.897
Mr. Shi.
Marketing and Finance Department …

04:20.922 --> 04:22.580
just released
the Le'an assessment report.

04:22.612 --> 04:25.042
From what we can see now,
there is still room for negotiation.

04:25.187 --> 04:27.028
But, you really
consider to…

04:30.894 --> 04:32.262
Besides that,

04:32.293 --> 04:34.931
where did they get
so much money all of a sudden?

04:37.308 --> 04:38.902
There will always be someone…

04:38.927 --> 04:40.625
who is willing to do
something profitable.

04:46.996 --> 04:48.375
Shu Yi, long time no see.

04:48.797 --> 04:50.422
Where are you going?
I'll give you a ride.

04:51.799 --> 04:53.325
Thanks, no need.

04:54.595 --> 04:56.075
I was alone in the car.

04:56.100 --> 04:57.708
This car was bought
for me by Le Zhi.

04:57.733 --> 04:59.611
I will be working
at Mingyu in two days.

05:00.703 --> 05:03.322
If you like driving so much,
why don't you become a driver?

05:08.095 --> 05:09.583
Who's this?

05:09.793 --> 05:11.099
He has a very nice car.

05:11.124 --> 05:13.832
Why did he just gift you
a Mercedes worth 300,000?

05:14.498 --> 05:16.860
And, you still have to wait a few
days before you can go to work?

05:16.885 --> 05:19.217
For something that uncle
can achieve with one sentence,

05:19.297 --> 05:21.899
why do you have to go through so many
interviews before you can get in?

05:21.924 --> 05:24.192
It feels like you'd better be quick and
work hard as a driver.

05:24.217 --> 05:25.713
Don't stop here
and get busy.

05:32.994 --> 05:34.083
Shan Shan!

05:34.200 --> 05:36.510
You are really good
at scolding people.

05:36.698 --> 05:38.325
That was a great relief.

05:39.907 --> 05:41.713
With his mentality,

05:41.738 --> 05:43.801
he still dreams
of riding in the car that is there...

05:43.826 --> 05:45.122
registration plate
with repeating digits.

05:45.147 --> 05:46.408
He looked
down on Shi Yan too much,

05:46.439 --> 05:48.125
and too sure
of myself.

05:49.907 --> 05:51.107
Let him come.

05:51.708 --> 05:54.292
Ms. Zheng might
prefer this car.

05:56.989 --> 05:58.324
What do you think?

06:00.500 --> 06:03.715
Some people can change
their car easily,

06:03.740 --> 06:04.979
but I work hard...

06:05.004 --> 06:07.412
only to have my interview outline
stolen and my interview fail.

06:09.694 --> 06:11.593
Stop saying
sad things.

06:11.618 --> 06:13.777
With your face that can
overthrow a kingdom...

06:13.801 --> 06:15.207
and destroy a country,

06:15.232 --> 06:16.904
I, as a
woman, can't refuse it.

06:16.929 --> 06:18.458
What man
can turn you down?

06:19.287 --> 06:21.186
Even though my face looks like
what you said,

06:21.589 --> 06:22.896
i'm still being played…

06:22.921 --> 06:24.458
and left
alone in the car.

06:25.600 --> 06:28.028
I helped you make
an appointment with Situ Yi.

06:28.601 --> 06:30.792
You know how hard it is to
make a date with him now?

06:31.291 --> 06:33.797
Luckily, we had some
connections when we were in school.

06:33.822 --> 06:35.302
We share
our experiences in love,

06:35.334 --> 06:37.199
and I also lent
her clothes for appointments.

06:37.224 --> 06:38.734
We have some influence relationships.

06:38.900 --> 06:40.818
Otherwise, you won't
be able to meet him.

06:42.599 --> 06:44.921
Shan Shan, thank you.

06:45.007 --> 06:47.500
That's why I bought you
this delicious meal, okay?

06:51.794 --> 06:53.494
Honestly, darling,

06:54.001 --> 06:56.720
Even I, as a woman, can't
reject you with that expression.

06:56.892 --> 06:59.721
So, why does Shi Yan
treat you like that?

07:00.199 --> 07:01.866
Or, should I say,

07:01.891 --> 07:03.822
all men like to sell expensive?

07:03.847 --> 07:05.819
So, they talk like they don't like it,
and act like real men.

07:07.099 --> 07:09.396
What matters now
is not one man's strategy,

07:09.428 --> 07:12.033
but to retake
my headline coverage.

07:13.191 --> 07:17.079
You are so persistent about
covering this year's headlines.

07:17.401 --> 07:19.907
I don't want to compete for
headline coverage. I just want to…

07:19.932 --> 07:21.682
"Prove me that I have the ability
to be promoted..."

07:21.707 --> 07:23.504
"to write
for digital magazines."

07:24.104 --> 07:26.326
You want to write for a
digital magazine with a new perspective…

07:26.351 --> 07:28.816
which speaks for
the common financial reader,

07:28.853 --> 07:31.096
which is different from
paper magazines, right?

07:31.900 --> 07:34.542
I've heard you say that many times .

07:35.414 --> 07:37.082
But, from an outsider's perspective,

07:37.107 --> 07:38.919
you're still competing for
headline coverage, aren't you?

07:39.292 --> 07:40.373
Actually,

07:40.398 --> 07:42.628
wouldn't it be great
to be a deputy author?

07:43.204 --> 07:44.986
It might be great to
be a deputy author,

07:45.011 --> 07:46.899
but that's not
really my goal.

07:47.007 --> 07:49.168
Embracing change and
writing for digital magazines…

07:49.193 --> 07:50.732
is my professional ideal.

07:51.101 --> 07:52.264
you see,

07:52.289 --> 07:53.829
when I interviewed Shi Yan,

07:53.909 --> 07:56.588
he changed the interview time
immediately and we were surprised.

07:56.613 --> 07:58.289
But, writing for a digital magazine
won't be like that.

07:58.416 --> 07:59.938
We can maintain
the timeliness of the news,

07:59.963 --> 08:01.679
and there are various ways of publication.

08:01.723 --> 08:03.463
Just send the link and
we can share it.

08:03.488 --> 08:05.803
This has become a
new reading habit of people nowadays.

08:05.828 --> 08:07.360
And, there are also various
formats we can choose from…

08:07.385 --> 08:08.717
to convey to the reader.

08:09.208 --> 08:10.740
So, I will not give up.

08:11.593 --> 08:14.165
I have already planned a special coverage…

08:14.190 --> 08:15.564
to put in a digital magazine.

08:15.589 --> 08:16.810
If that can be realized,

08:16.835 --> 08:19.316
so I will be one step
closer to my goal.

08:20.697 --> 08:22.717
Mr. Shi, I'm sorry.

08:22.822 --> 08:24.809
It's time to go back
and I'm still bothering you.

08:25.293 --> 08:26.493
It's fine.

08:26.894 --> 08:28.111
Let's drink first.

08:28.397 --> 08:30.015
Is something important happening?

08:31.600 --> 08:33.667
After we talk about the duration of the day,

08:33.892 --> 08:35.818
I always think
what you say,

08:36.002 --> 08:37.817
and discuss it with the team.

08:38.093 --> 08:40.621
We don't want to lose a
great visionary like you.

08:41.395 --> 08:43.300
So, I came this time…

08:43.500 --> 08:47.583
to talk to you again
about the investment amount.

08:48.494 --> 08:49.694
Yes.

08:50.508 --> 08:53.201
I am so glad that
you came looking for me at this time.

08:53.685 --> 08:55.898
But, Mr. Chen,
please give me some time.

08:58.095 --> 08:59.516
I understand that.

08:59.894 --> 09:02.428
Renegotiation
will definitely take some time.

09:03.103 --> 09:04.169
But,

09:04.194 --> 09:06.617
I have some
pressure on my side.

09:09.599 --> 09:11.907
I'm glad you
reconsidered my suggestion.

09:12.001 --> 09:13.629
I will give you
an answer as soon as possible.

09:14.687 --> 09:15.887
Okay.

09:20.186 --> 09:21.770
If you follow what you say,

09:21.795 --> 09:24.614
you and Xu Yu Ling
use the same skeleton,

09:24.788 --> 09:26.980
very difficult to know
who won or lost,

09:27.005 --> 09:29.504
unless you have a way
to get new content.

09:30.500 --> 09:31.583
You are right.

09:32.292 --> 09:36.083
But, I have to meet
him for new content.

09:37.480 --> 09:38.941
Look for opportunities.

09:39.388 --> 09:41.471
You two rode
horses together yesterday.

09:41.496 --> 09:43.473
That counts as a bit of a
personal connection, right?

09:44.385 --> 09:45.789
I don't even have his WeChat,

09:45.814 --> 09:47.405
how can that be
called a personal relationship?

09:47.430 --> 09:49.716
After all, he is very strange.

09:50.494 --> 09:52.693
Does it matter
if he's weird or not?

09:52.718 --> 09:54.974
You need to be clear with
your goals, Zheng Shu Yi.

09:54.999 --> 09:57.366
You're not just fighting
for headline coverage.

09:57.391 --> 09:58.782
You fight
so that one day,

09:58.807 --> 10:00.495
you can destroy
that useless man…

10:00.520 --> 10:02.481
and the girl who
stole your interview.

10:02.506 --> 10:04.387
You also fight to
upgrade the digital magazine…

10:04.418 --> 10:05.830
long awaited.

10:15.696 --> 10:17.255
The goods have been sent to
you via express order.

10:17.280 --> 10:18.514
Don't forget to check.

10:20.008 --> 10:22.206
- Who's he?
- Someone who is boring.

10:24.592 --> 10:27.018
Another man
has fallen at your feet.

10:28.299 --> 10:29.883
So many people are chasing you.

10:29.908 --> 10:31.583
None you like?

10:33.507 --> 10:35.245
You do not understand.

10:35.716 --> 10:37.320
My principle is…

10:37.701 --> 10:41.333
didn't refuse, didn't explain,
didn't appeal.

10:41.585 --> 10:44.519
After all, he wants to trick me
with such basic tricks?

10:44.892 --> 10:46.333
He looks down on me, doesn't he?

10:47.007 --> 10:48.205
What trick?

10:48.303 --> 10:50.372
Use excuses to
help me fix something…

10:50.397 --> 10:52.310
and deliberately
left something at my house,

10:52.335 --> 10:54.215
in order to create an opportunity
to meet like this.

10:54.625 --> 10:57.745
Such a cheap trick,
and people still use it today.

10:57.770 --> 10:59.368
Speaking of which,

10:59.393 --> 11:01.442
I also have
something left in Shi Yan there.

11:02.894 --> 11:04.505
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

11:04.993 --> 11:07.225
That's a
great opportunity to meet.

11:26.687 --> 11:27.887
Helo.

11:31.800 --> 11:33.000
Tuan Shi.

11:33.796 --> 11:36.216
Miss Zheng Shu Yi from
Financial Introduction is looking for you.

11:41.699 --> 11:42.899
Helo?

11:44.398 --> 11:45.819
Helo, Tuan Shi.

11:46.097 --> 11:48.385
I think my earrings
fell in your car.

11:48.410 --> 11:49.838
Did you see it?

11:52.293 --> 11:53.531
I don't see.

11:58.292 --> 12:00.686
Earrings are
very important to me.

12:00.711 --> 12:02.586
Can you search again?

12:04.000 --> 12:05.380
How important is it?

12:07.188 --> 12:09.710
More important than my life.

12:09.990 --> 12:11.836
It is important because…

12:12.893 --> 12:15.113
it was left to
my mother by my grandmother,

12:15.193 --> 12:16.797
and my mother gave it to me.

12:16.887 --> 12:18.500
It's a family heirloom...

12:20.788 --> 12:22.313
and my wedding present.

12:22.707 --> 12:25.304
I plan to wear it
at my future wedding.

12:25.692 --> 12:27.571
When I saw it,
I remembered my grandmother.

12:27.596 --> 12:29.907
I haven't seen him in a long time.

12:30.298 --> 12:32.181
My grandmother wrapped it
in a scarf with six layers,

12:32.206 --> 12:33.714
and keep it
for years.

12:33.739 --> 12:35.620
Usually, I don't
take it out to wear.

12:36.495 --> 12:39.126
So, why are you
willing to use it this time?

12:43.287 --> 12:44.600
This is because…

12:44.625 --> 12:46.777
This is because it is a very valuable heirloom .

12:46.808 --> 12:50.020
Only worthy of the important moment
when I interview you.

12:53.814 --> 12:55.015
I have seen it.

12:55.312 --> 12:57.916
Your wedding gift
is made of plastic.

13:03.500 --> 13:04.717
About that…

13:05.706 --> 13:08.400
My ancestors were poor
and life was very difficult.

13:08.425 --> 13:09.465
They are farmers.

13:09.490 --> 13:11.005
They don't see much of the world.

13:11.086 --> 13:12.774
Although it is made
of plastic,

13:12.799 --> 13:15.432
but it was the most valuable item
in our family at that time.

13:21.092 --> 13:22.615
Send it to him.

13:25.294 --> 13:27.513
Miss Zheng, when do you need it?

13:27.894 --> 13:30.493
As soon as possible. I can't
sleep without seeing it.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.272
Well, I'll
send it to you.

13:32.297 --> 13:33.497
So.

13:34.614 --> 13:35.978
I don't want to trouble you.

13:36.003 --> 13:37.533
I'll go get it myself.

13:42.096 --> 13:43.296
Good.

13:59.593 --> 14:01.907
Shu Yi, what are you thinking?

14:02.105 --> 14:05.323
You met Shi Yan with
a pair of plastic earrings?

14:05.889 --> 14:07.581
Why plastic?

14:07.606 --> 14:09.899
Plastic is one of
man's greatest inventions.

14:09.924 --> 14:11.791
Plastic has improved
human life.

14:11.816 --> 14:13.302
Why look down on plastic?

14:14.302 --> 14:16.006
What are you saying?

14:16.491 --> 14:17.862
You've embarrassed
yourself like this,

14:17.887 --> 14:19.413
and Shi Yan didn't put your phone down.

14:19.438 --> 14:21.000
He also wants to send it to you.

14:21.284 --> 14:23.115
He must be interested in you.

14:32.003 --> 14:33.541
Bogang Yunwan?

14:38.693 --> 14:40.772
For a residential area
with this price,

14:40.797 --> 14:43.633
no need to even think to know that this
is the address of Shi Yan's residence.

14:43.907 --> 14:46.375
Is he
so honest?

14:46.699 --> 14:48.416
This is called having no
feelings for you?

14:48.601 --> 14:50.309
How could it be…

14:50.490 --> 14:51.690
So…

14:51.715 --> 14:53.560
Just leave me
alone in the lobby and go.

14:53.585 --> 14:55.434
He doesn't even want to eat with me.

14:57.202 --> 15:00.221
You throw the bait,

15:00.393 --> 15:02.332
and he immediately
sent you the address.

15:02.673 --> 15:04.720
Is he so impatient?

15:05.779 --> 15:07.506
He is not usually
impatient.

15:07.531 --> 15:09.399
So, there's only one meaning to this.

15:09.900 --> 15:11.216
All man are the same.

15:11.594 --> 15:14.213
I'm telling you, in
this situation, you shouldn't go.

15:17.191 --> 15:18.521
What are you doing?

15:21.090 --> 15:22.710
Just take action
that will definitely work, understand?

15:22.993 --> 15:24.207
I understand.

15:24.232 --> 15:25.427
But, not this time.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.836
I have a plan to
discuss with Shi Yan.

15:28.298 --> 15:29.734
What plan?

15:48.987 --> 15:50.187
Uncle,

15:51.394 --> 15:52.675
why are you back?

15:52.700 --> 15:54.636
Shouldn't you
meet Guan Ji?

15:55.188 --> 15:57.137
Didn't you say
not to call him Guan Ji?

15:57.593 --> 15:59.917
Guan Ji said call him Guan Ji.

16:02.187 --> 16:04.777
Uncle hasn't told me why
he suddenly came back tonight.

16:06.496 --> 16:08.026
This is my house.

16:08.186 --> 16:11.207
If you don't want to see me,
go back and live with your grandfather.

16:17.292 --> 16:19.727
I will pack my things.

16:21.802 --> 16:24.325
Sit in the room.
Don't go out unless I tell you to.

16:27.500 --> 16:31.894
(Bogang Yunwan)

16:38.090 --> 16:39.924
- Thank You.
- You're welcome.

17:51.490 --> 17:53.928
Mr. Shi, I am here
to take something.

18:10.302 --> 18:12.698
Mr. Shi, are you also
interested in Song Le Lan?

18:16.692 --> 18:18.119
One coincidence.

18:18.289 --> 18:21.211
I also really like it.
I have all his albums.

18:21.401 --> 18:23.115
Which of his songs do you like the most?

18:31.293 --> 18:32.801
Why did you suddenly
cancel the appointment?

18:32.826 --> 18:34.273
Chen Sheng said
you are working,

18:34.298 --> 18:35.800
but Yue said you are at home.

18:35.825 --> 18:38.321
So, that must not be for work.

18:38.694 --> 18:42.609
Speak up. Maybe you're
in love with someone?

18:43.702 --> 18:45.808
You haven't been in a relationship
for three years, have you?

18:46.694 --> 18:48.750
I'm too busy to
talk to you.

18:49.298 --> 18:51.311
The more you say that, the more
I think it's not about work.

18:51.493 --> 18:53.421
It's not appropriate to talk now.
We'll talk later.

18:54.729 --> 18:55.901
Fast. Let's drink.

18:55.927 --> 18:57.103
Hey!

18:57.128 --> 18:58.583
How dare you forget me?

18:58.608 --> 19:00.278
No, I haven't forgotten. Cheers!

19:00.600 --> 19:01.934
That's too weird.

19:02.898 --> 19:04.304
Is he in a relationship?

19:14.681 --> 19:15.881
Guan Ji.

19:16.394 --> 19:18.109
Let's drink. What do you think?

19:18.299 --> 19:20.226
Are you thinking about women?

19:21.593 --> 19:23.921
I go first. Have fun.

19:25.086 --> 19:26.927
- Why are you in a hurry to leave?
- Guan Ji.

19:27.494 --> 19:29.333
Why is he so weird today?

19:29.514 --> 19:31.401
- What is happening?
- Let's see.

19:32.099 --> 19:33.429
Is there anything else?

19:37.807 --> 19:39.530
Are you
busy with work…

19:39.555 --> 19:41.729
related to Le'an Technology
lately?

19:43.506 --> 19:46.319
Are you having
problems with this?

19:46.500 --> 19:48.700
My colleague is
writing a draft for Lieying.

19:48.725 --> 19:50.938
I also did the same interview
with Mr. Chen from Le'an.

19:51.292 --> 19:52.776
If I'm right,

19:52.801 --> 19:56.494
there may be different opinions
in Yunchuang…

19:56.519 --> 19:58.118
against Lieying and Le'an.

20:01.808 --> 20:04.402
Lieying weighed in secretly
and openly in an interview…

20:04.427 --> 20:05.988
that Yunchuang will
invest with them,

20:06.013 --> 20:08.120
and Le'an has
expressed the same idea.

20:08.387 --> 20:10.538
But, you said in
the last interview that you…

20:10.563 --> 20:12.373
appreciate technological innovation more...

20:12.398 --> 20:14.366
and core technology autonomy,

20:14.391 --> 20:16.614
so you are more inclined
towards Lean Technology.

20:16.989 --> 20:19.463
But, there may be a
different opinion in Yunchuang.

20:19.488 --> 20:21.271
If Guan Capital wants to join,

20:21.296 --> 20:23.230
so their opinion
is also very important.

20:23.607 --> 20:26.305
So that's why you've
been so busy lately.

20:30.006 --> 20:31.206
So?

20:31.893 --> 20:34.727
I happened to be doing
a personal interview with Chen Kang.

20:35.095 --> 20:38.282
So, I want to use
your interview as an opportunity…

20:38.307 --> 20:40.083
to do an
exclusive interview series…

20:40.108 --> 20:42.184
before you
finish this.

20:42.209 --> 20:43.803
I want to invite
some related parties,

20:43.827 --> 20:47.216
such as Yunchuang, Le'an and
Guan Capital, in discussion.

21:06.191 --> 21:07.413
what do you want to drink

21:08.001 --> 21:09.918
Lemon juice, thank you.

21:46.800 --> 21:48.038
do you want ice?

21:48.393 --> 21:49.822
Oh my god, you are so handsome.

21:50.102 --> 21:51.302
What?

21:55.504 --> 21:56.704
Son.

22:09.195 --> 22:10.884
If you are right,

22:10.909 --> 22:13.116
Why do you think
I will succeed?

22:13.316 --> 22:15.011
If I do
as you say,

22:15.036 --> 22:16.712
How much
headline coverage can you get?

22:29.578 --> 22:31.504
There is a girl here.

22:32.002 --> 22:33.305
Female friend?

22:34.896 --> 22:36.524
Shi Yan had a female friend?

22:41.690 --> 22:42.890
Tuan Shi,

22:42.999 --> 22:46.601
did i bother
you and your girlfriend?

22:48.393 --> 22:51.415
Please consider
my suggestions carefully.

22:52.393 --> 22:53.793
Female friend?

22:54.981 --> 22:56.211
The woman in the room,

22:56.236 --> 22:57.568
isn't she your girlfriend

22:57.593 --> 22:58.793
Not.

22:59.894 --> 23:01.094
Good, if that's the case.

23:02.387 --> 23:03.589
Good?

23:03.614 --> 23:04.820
What kind of good is that?

23:06.488 --> 23:07.594
Just…

23:07.619 --> 23:09.929
We can avoid
unnecessary misunderstandings.

23:10.986 --> 23:12.250
Misunderstanding?

23:12.275 --> 23:13.440
As an example?

23:15.299 --> 23:17.925
So, you're saying my nephew
won't get it wrong?

23:19.694 --> 23:21.011
Nephew?

23:22.602 --> 23:24.914
Nephew? That means…

23:26.602 --> 23:29.025
It will be worse if
your nephew gets it wrong.

23:29.050 --> 23:30.910
I go first. Early rest.

23:36.701 --> 23:37.921
Who's coming?

23:37.995 --> 23:40.500
I seem to hear a woman's voice.

23:50.793 --> 23:51.967
Barely.

23:51.992 --> 23:54.730
I almost got into a fight
with his nephew.

23:55.406 --> 23:57.077
If I ran into him earlier,

23:57.102 --> 23:59.074
Yunchuang special report and
digital magazine upgrade...

23:59.099 --> 24:00.721
must end.

24:09.495 --> 24:11.216
He came here
without taking this back.

24:11.497 --> 24:13.333
Interesting trick.

24:15.982 --> 24:18.210
What are you looking at?

24:18.600 --> 24:20.111
Who let you out?

24:22.587 --> 24:24.508
Who was that person just now?

24:24.692 --> 24:25.992
Uncle's girlfriend?

24:33.183 --> 24:36.080
Uncle, I've thought about it.

24:36.300 --> 24:39.416
What if I
don't go to work for now?

24:39.500 --> 24:41.509
Can I go
abroad to study?

24:42.792 --> 24:44.128
Studying abroad?

24:44.404 --> 24:46.219
You really deserve
to say that?

24:49.997 --> 24:51.222
Actually,

24:51.604 --> 24:53.490
why do people have to do
something meaningless...

24:53.515 --> 24:54.883
and it doesn't work?

24:54.908 --> 24:56.502
Our entire family
is elite…

24:56.526 --> 24:57.989
who work hard
to earn money.

24:58.014 --> 24:59.504
But, no one…

24:59.535 --> 25:02.328
there is time to spend
money and enjoy life.

25:02.597 --> 25:05.533
So, why
can't I be that person?

25:05.897 --> 25:08.415
If someone has to
spend money,

25:09.014 --> 25:10.210
I can do.

25:12.583 --> 25:15.310
In high school,
you never passed chemistry.

25:15.404 --> 25:17.271
But, you know more
about cosmetic ingredients...

25:17.296 --> 25:18.670
from the Chemistry teacher.

25:19.001 --> 25:20.795
You were sent
to college abroad,

25:20.820 --> 25:22.079
and your english is not good,

25:22.104 --> 25:24.691
but that doesn't stop you
from booking a ticket…

25:24.716 --> 25:26.075
and travel around the world.

25:26.100 --> 25:27.700
So, this is not something
that doesn't work.

25:27.725 --> 25:29.906
It depends on whether
you want to succeed or not.

25:32.087 --> 25:35.016
I know I did
something wrong.

25:36.088 --> 25:38.767
But, uncle, whatever
you want me to do,

25:38.792 --> 25:40.694
Uncle can't
let me go to work.

25:40.719 --> 25:41.911
I never wake up early…

25:41.936 --> 25:43.197
and staying up late for
college entrance exams.

25:43.222 --> 25:44.406
Should I work…

25:44.430 --> 25:46.614
nine in the morning to five in the evening
for a few thousand salary now?

25:50.299 --> 25:52.379
It's almost the end of the year.

25:52.404 --> 25:54.223
Why don't we talk
about this after the new year.

25:55.108 --> 25:56.701
Is it okay?

25:56.726 --> 25:59.028
- Tolonglah, pak cik.
- Qin Shi Yue.

26:01.305 --> 26:03.214
The Shi family does not keep
useless people.

26:10.094 --> 26:11.615
Not bad.

26:11.707 --> 26:14.192
You really have the potential…

26:14.492 --> 26:16.990
to become an expert without a teacher.

26:17.015 --> 26:19.620
You went there and didn't
take the earring back…

26:19.914 --> 26:21.495
to see him again.

26:21.520 --> 26:23.208
You create opportunities.

26:23.703 --> 26:24.903
Smart.

26:25.407 --> 26:27.380
So, you have to
contact him immediately...

26:27.405 --> 26:29.209
to arrange a time
to go home again.

26:29.393 --> 26:30.593
Hurry up.

26:32.191 --> 26:34.318
We'll talk later. I still
have something to do here.

26:42.701 --> 26:44.304
Smart, so to speak.

26:44.329 --> 26:46.416
I did
n't take it back on purpose.

26:46.905 --> 26:48.736
But, I don't have the number.

26:48.761 --> 26:50.429
How do I contact him?

26:51.293 --> 26:54.117
I don't know if
the special report will be successful or not.

26:55.417 --> 26:57.402
Alas!

26:57.427 --> 26:59.604
What should I do?

26:59.707 --> 27:02.134
What should I do?

27:03.227 --> 27:05.725
They all say it's hard to
ask you out in person,

27:07.000 --> 27:08.625
I didn't think you came out either.

27:10.291 --> 27:12.169
Want to go out or not...

27:12.194 --> 27:13.831
depends on who the person is.

27:14.700 --> 27:16.000
It's late.

27:16.394 --> 27:18.027
Nothing else to
see here.

27:19.307 --> 27:21.721
So, why don't we
go somewhere else?

27:29.792 --> 27:31.232
Tonight is a beautiful night.

27:31.402 --> 27:33.027
There are also
beautiful views elsewhere.

27:35.391 --> 27:38.606
Or, should we
go get something to drink?

27:39.605 --> 27:41.511
Or, you want to…

27:42.891 --> 27:44.624
It's time
to go somewhere else.

27:46.207 --> 27:48.230
I really want to
go somewhere else.

27:48.686 --> 27:50.718
But, not with you.

27:51.100 --> 27:52.217
I go first.

27:52.400 --> 27:53.600
Goodbye.

28:21.093 --> 28:22.379
Tuan Shi.

28:22.404 --> 28:24.778
I think my earrings
fell in your car.

28:24.803 --> 28:26.209
Did you see it?

28:26.995 --> 28:28.222
I don't see.

28:28.409 --> 28:30.790
Earrings are
very important to me.

28:30.815 --> 28:32.639
Can you search again?

28:33.593 --> 28:34.750
How important is it?

29:05.788 --> 29:07.868
Xu Yu Ling was called
to the author's office.

29:07.893 --> 29:09.730
Maybe they
want to use the draft?

29:11.706 --> 29:13.321
I have done everything
I should have done.

29:13.346 --> 29:15.177
Maybe I did what
I shouldn't have done too.

29:15.394 --> 29:17.226
I'm still confident in my draft.

29:17.316 --> 29:18.860
Since I've done
all I can,

29:18.891 --> 29:20.214
I just leave it to fate.

29:23.890 --> 29:25.071
Where are you going?

29:26.008 --> 29:28.103
I want to wash my face
to refresh myself,

29:28.128 --> 29:30.272
and I will be back to continue
exploring the value of some news.

29:30.297 --> 29:32.527
Regardless, my career
still has to go on.

29:43.908 --> 29:45.806
Don't mention it again.

29:45.906 --> 29:47.936
Shi Yan was really…

29:48.004 --> 29:49.289
I am very unfortunate.

29:49.314 --> 29:51.479
Shi Yan did not say
anything useful at all.

29:51.517 --> 29:53.626
It's all just normal conversation.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.492
If he doesn't want to be interviewed,
he should just say it.

29:55.517 --> 29:56.768
Why did he do that to me?

29:56.793 --> 29:58.333
He is really useless.

29:59.299 --> 30:00.936
Just a casual conversation?

30:01.188 --> 30:02.991
But he gave me
a lot of information.

30:03.029 --> 30:05.135
Who knows how he
dealt with Shi Yan?

30:05.229 --> 30:08.104
You know that looks
really good, right?

30:08.219 --> 30:09.921
Besides, he will do anything
to achieve his goals.

30:09.946 --> 30:11.282
I have already interviewed Shi Yan,

30:11.307 --> 30:13.226
and he was also able to
interview Tang Yi.

30:13.252 --> 30:15.170
Using his draft? He…

30:17.484 --> 30:19.740
- Luckily it wasn't damaged.
- Thank you.

30:23.407 --> 30:25.112
Thank you for
the compliment, Yu Ling.

30:38.888 --> 30:40.325
Enough already.

30:40.796 --> 30:43.735
Xu Yu Ling did something
very unfair this time.

30:43.993 --> 30:45.475
I warned him earlier.

30:45.500 --> 30:46.879
I will put it on the record.

30:47.606 --> 30:49.085
He will be judged accordingly…

30:49.110 --> 30:50.500
during performance and
year-end evaluation.

30:50.525 --> 30:53.301
Next time, I will
avoid this kind of situation.

30:54.194 --> 30:56.385
Stealing other people's drafts
is not allowed.

30:56.412 --> 30:58.111
Is the warning enough?

30:58.407 --> 30:59.913
What do you mean?

31:00.794 --> 31:02.418
You want me to fire him?

31:05.401 --> 31:06.973
He's just very depressed.

31:06.998 --> 31:08.693
Our brand has not been launched yet.

31:08.718 --> 31:10.778
Our financial news coverage is very small.

31:10.803 --> 31:12.293
It doesn't matter if
the company fires him…

31:12.318 --> 31:13.897
or he stops himself,

31:13.922 --> 31:15.817
others
will surely ask why.

31:15.893 --> 31:18.492
His career will also be affected.

31:22.493 --> 31:23.914
Why don't you say anything?

31:24.698 --> 31:27.113
I can understand him
stealing my interview,

31:27.278 --> 31:29.339
but why did he have to
steal my interview outline?

31:29.364 --> 31:31.468
Doesn't this prove that
your interview outline is better?

31:31.493 --> 31:33.368
He has proven it
with his actions…

31:33.393 --> 31:35.118
that you are better than him.

31:35.925 --> 31:38.425
This time, you have
won beautifully.

31:38.603 --> 31:41.293
For a journalist,
the biggest punishment is...

31:41.318 --> 31:43.231
thwarted by the
journalistic ability of others.

31:43.388 --> 31:44.761
I think, this time,

31:44.786 --> 31:46.670
he really
learned his lesson.

31:49.307 --> 31:50.528
Shu Yi.

31:50.820 --> 31:53.923
You still have
a long way to go in this industry.

31:54.408 --> 31:57.325
Be merciful while you can.

32:00.397 --> 32:05.526
So, Shi Yan chose
my interview outline, right?

32:06.507 --> 32:07.567
Of.

32:07.991 --> 32:09.581
Shi Yan was quite principled.

32:09.606 --> 32:12.222
This time, he didn't make a fool of
the Financial Introduction,

32:12.247 --> 32:13.978
he did not refuse
Xu Yu Ling's interview.

32:14.003 --> 32:15.823
He also gives you
enough information.

32:15.913 --> 32:17.910
In the end, nobody loses.

32:18.300 --> 32:20.193
Look at his EQ and
learn from him.

32:20.899 --> 32:23.397
There is one more thing.
I think you understand it too.

32:23.422 --> 32:25.089
Sama ada Yunchuang atau Shi Yan,

32:25.114 --> 32:27.027
they chose
Financial Introduction first…

32:27.316 --> 32:30.512
and then choose one
of you two.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.678
Sister Yi, I understand.

32:33.793 --> 32:37.167
All my achievements are
based on our magazine platform,

32:37.192 --> 32:39.801
which is among
the best in the industry.

32:39.826 --> 32:41.906
So, I want to write
better for each article…

32:41.931 --> 32:43.982
to defend
the dignity of Financial Identification.

32:44.494 --> 32:46.397
You are so beautiful and smart,

32:46.713 --> 32:49.226
so don't waste
your time getting angry.

32:49.901 --> 32:51.515
Thank you for
your compliment, author.

32:51.693 --> 32:54.717
A beautiful and intelligent person
is going to interview now.

33:08.981 --> 33:10.181
Helo?

33:11.894 --> 33:13.000
I'm not busy.

33:13.025 --> 33:15.030
I just had a conversation
with a subordinate.

33:16.883 --> 33:18.365
He has a strong will,

33:18.390 --> 33:19.941
just like me when I was young.

33:22.707 --> 33:24.855
I have arranged it
with the HR department.

33:25.407 --> 33:27.212
There is no problem for
him to come and be a trainee.

33:27.384 --> 33:29.580
But, whether he would be accepted
depended on his abilities.

33:29.981 --> 33:31.170
Maybe a lot of people…

33:31.195 --> 33:33.923
think I'm better suited in
research than entrepreneurship,

33:34.306 --> 33:36.302
but my mentor always
encouraged me…

33:36.327 --> 33:37.613
to apply
what is learned.

33:37.638 --> 33:40.585
What was more important was
the country's industrial development.

33:40.610 --> 33:42.125
So, I have to try it.

33:43.517 --> 33:46.367
In the past, everyone
still used…

33:46.392 --> 33:48.496
traditional technology to make
domestic substitutes for chips.

33:48.521 --> 33:49.791
So, I guess…

33:49.822 --> 33:52.206
we have to find
something new,

33:52.495 --> 33:54.363
although there may
be some risks.

33:54.400 --> 33:55.681
When we succeed,

33:55.706 --> 33:57.633
Our products will be internationally competitive …

33:57.658 --> 34:00.022
because we do not copy
the achievements of others.

34:00.990 --> 34:04.176
After listening to your experience,
I feel your life,

34:04.201 --> 34:05.929
up to this point,
it is very determined.

34:06.218 --> 34:09.017
Have you ever worried or hesitated?

34:11.597 --> 34:14.465
To be honest, when I
first got into this field,

34:14.490 --> 34:16.269
and learn this technology,

34:16.294 --> 34:17.881
My original intention was to
serve the community.

34:18.028 --> 34:19.824
But, recently,
I suddenly realized…

34:19.849 --> 34:21.606
with the
current development of Le'an Technology,

34:21.634 --> 34:23.368
if I'm still blind...

34:23.393 --> 34:25.222
considering
the research stage only,

34:25.247 --> 34:27.620
regardless of the feelings
and opinions of my team members,

34:28.007 --> 34:29.636
I am
self-important towards them.

34:30.299 --> 34:32.017
Le'an is not just mine.

34:32.194 --> 34:34.096
It is the hard work
of our entire team.

34:34.147 --> 34:35.951
So, if you ask…

34:35.976 --> 34:37.884
whether I ever
worried or hesitated,

34:38.700 --> 34:42.933
now is the moment
I worry and hesitate the most.

34:46.592 --> 34:47.978
Tuan Chen,

34:48.015 --> 34:50.480
even though the things
we face are different,

34:50.505 --> 34:51.891
but i understand you

34:52.194 --> 34:55.414
Some things may just be
you who are diligent in the beginning.

34:55.439 --> 34:57.000
Every step is difficult at this time.

34:57.231 --> 35:00.138
After that, there are people who persevere
together, that's not easy either.

35:00.387 --> 35:01.801
But in this era,

35:01.833 --> 35:03.658
have an
ideal career and practice it…

35:03.683 --> 35:05.505
has become a
very lucky thing.

35:06.046 --> 35:08.592
I believe as long as
you are strong,

35:08.617 --> 35:10.229
the possibilities are unlimited.

35:54.487 --> 35:55.867
Delicious! Very delicious!

35:55.892 --> 35:57.780
Uncle is not only
good at business,

35:57.805 --> 35:58.983
but also good at cooking.

35:59.008 --> 36:00.621
Uncle Aunt's charm no
one can resist.

36:01.692 --> 36:03.309
If you like it, eat more.

36:03.354 --> 36:04.918
When you're full, you can go.

36:06.224 --> 36:08.250
Go? Where to?

36:19.789 --> 36:22.283
Uncle, I suddenly
remembered I have an appointment.

36:22.308 --> 36:23.981
I go first.
Eat slowly.

36:24.006 --> 36:25.112
Qin Shi Yue,

36:26.503 --> 36:28.198
if you dare to
walk out of this door,

36:28.229 --> 36:30.117
I will deactivate
your card immediately.

36:31.515 --> 36:33.077
It's okay if the card is deactivated.

36:33.102 --> 36:34.911
I will ask
my grandfather for money.

36:36.985 --> 36:38.910
You can ask
your grandfather for money.

36:38.935 --> 36:40.941
But, don't you think
of coming back here.

36:40.966 --> 36:42.920
I will change the password.
Think carefully.

36:49.206 --> 36:53.187
The best uncle,
the most caring about me,

36:53.212 --> 36:54.354
and my dearest

36:54.379 --> 36:56.495
You won't do
this to me, will you?

36:56.795 --> 36:58.080
My love is deep.

36:58.105 --> 36:59.816
That's why I discipline
you strictly.

37:01.293 --> 37:03.724
How long until I get home?

37:04.808 --> 37:06.523
Give me some time…

37:06.548 --> 37:08.427
to adapt
to life in China.

37:08.903 --> 37:10.996
Don't act like you're unfamiliar
with the environment here.

37:11.021 --> 37:13.008
You have traveled
all over the world since childhood.

37:13.033 --> 37:14.814
You are used to
any environment.

37:17.001 --> 37:19.499
Uncle,

37:20.590 --> 37:23.194
at least I
graduated from a prestigious university.

37:23.219 --> 37:24.702
Do you want to sell me
just like that?

37:24.727 --> 37:26.693
And, for just
a few thousand a month?

37:26.786 --> 37:28.419
This is a bad deal.

37:29.393 --> 37:31.189
You think too highly
of yourself, don't you?

37:31.214 --> 37:33.522
A trainer
is not worth much.

37:34.387 --> 37:36.607
If not for money,
why do I have to go to work?

37:36.632 --> 37:38.181
Our family does not lack money.

37:38.206 --> 37:41.178
I'm not a problem girl
and I don't cause problems either.

37:41.401 --> 37:42.917
Isn't that enough?

37:46.001 --> 37:47.323
Qin Shi Yue.

37:48.006 --> 37:50.668
Work is not just
a tool to get money.

37:50.693 --> 37:53.375
It also reflects
a person's sense of social responsibility…

37:53.400 --> 37:55.025
and personal values.

37:55.605 --> 37:58.420
If you don't lack anything
and have energy to spare,

37:58.597 --> 37:59.882
so why not do something…

37:59.907 --> 38:02.016
that means for
society and others?

38:05.302 --> 38:06.601
Any other questions?

38:07.507 --> 38:08.982
If not, sit down and have breakfast.

38:09.007 --> 38:10.613
After we eat,
I'll take you there.

38:45.207 --> 38:46.407
Let's go.

39:00.693 --> 39:01.798
Stop the car.

39:22.796 --> 39:25.004
Good morning.
Are you up at night again?

39:25.521 --> 39:27.786
I have good news. I
just heard that our department…

39:27.811 --> 39:29.426
will get two new trainees.

39:29.688 --> 39:31.205
What's so good about it?

39:31.230 --> 39:33.608
Of course that's good news.
Don't you want to find a coach?

39:33.702 --> 39:34.819
You are very busy.

39:34.850 --> 39:36.564
It would be great if someone
worked as your assistant.

39:36.589 --> 39:37.883
You can also avoid
staying awake at night.

39:37.921 --> 39:40.651
Don't joke. It's not certain
who will help whom.

39:46.401 --> 39:48.120
You know what he's going to do?

39:48.927 --> 39:50.828
No, and I don't care.

39:51.713 --> 39:54.593
I heard he got an interview
with an important person.

39:54.618 --> 39:56.828
I think he will
go to the interview.

39:57.407 --> 40:00.418
Looks like he's sure to get
headline coverage next.

40:03.308 --> 40:04.824
If so, I
wish him the best of luck.

40:06.295 --> 40:08.413
You don't have to worry
when he's with me.

40:08.800 --> 40:10.433
Although he was a bit late,

40:12.500 --> 40:15.208
it was still his first day at work.
He just needs to adapt.

40:16.293 --> 40:17.456
Do not worry.

40:17.481 --> 40:19.204
I work first and
we'll talk later.

40:23.708 --> 40:26.419
This is the new intern we hired
for our team. Try to see.

40:29.288 --> 40:31.378
We do not need
an intern at the moment.

40:31.403 --> 40:32.717
Give it to another team.

40:32.885 --> 40:34.904
Xu Yu Ling's team already has one.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.030
This one has been assigned to you.

40:37.093 --> 40:38.196
Lead him.

40:38.713 --> 40:41.888
Sis Yi, my workload
is heavy enough.

40:41.913 --> 40:44.380
I really don't have the time and
energy to lead new people.

40:44.583 --> 40:46.996
I know your workload is heavy.

40:47.021 --> 40:48.999
That's why I myself
found you a helper…

40:49.024 --> 40:51.499
to help you take
pictures and organize materials.

40:56.988 --> 40:58.875
Let's be honest here.

40:58.900 --> 41:00.694
What is this trainer's background?

41:00.719 --> 41:02.303
All I can tell you is…

41:02.328 --> 41:05.428
we hired him after
careful consideration.

41:06.293 --> 41:08.116
So, I have to accept it, right?

41:10.391 --> 41:13.101
From a work perspective, this is a
training task that I am giving you.

41:18.707 --> 41:20.253
From a more personal perspective,

41:21.592 --> 41:23.434
consider this as I
owe you a favor.

41:26.881 --> 41:28.081
Okay.

41:28.288 --> 41:29.461
Don't worry, author.

41:29.486 --> 41:31.023
I will lead him well.

41:38.100 --> 41:40.575
He graduated from a prestigious university
with high tuition fees.

41:40.693 --> 41:42.115
He is from a rich family.

41:42.394 --> 41:44.154
Why doesn't he just sit at home?

41:44.184 --> 41:46.217
Why did he come here
and work in the news industry?

41:46.897 --> 41:48.924
Tolerable, and she's beautiful.

41:49.382 --> 41:51.465
Her qualifications are beautiful.

41:51.490 --> 41:53.376
He is our junior
editor-in-chief.

41:53.401 --> 41:54.596
He's an excellent student, isn't he?

41:54.621 --> 41:55.800
What are you worried about?

41:56.888 --> 41:58.326
Look at his grades.

42:03.394 --> 42:07.034
His CGPA is just enough
to graduate.

42:08.305 --> 42:09.966
Look at his resume.
He also included…

42:09.991 --> 42:11.768
which he is the champion of
the campus singing competition.

42:11.793 --> 42:14.026
Obviously he has
nothing to show for it.

42:14.111 --> 42:15.716
He was just wasted in college.

42:15.990 --> 42:18.633
From her background, you can tell
she is a spoiled rich girl.

42:18.658 --> 42:19.820
100% sure.

42:21.401 --> 42:23.095
The author really
treated you "well".

42:23.120 --> 42:25.393
He gave you troublemakers.

42:25.425 --> 42:27.425
You can't blame him,
and you can't make him angry.
