01:46.217 --> 01:46.857
Thanks

01:56.243 --> 01:57.444
How could anyone give an exclusive interview?

01:57.523 --> 01:59.204
Make an appointment at a place like the racecourse

02:01.056 --> 02:01.816
This horse lover

02:01.976 --> 02:03.495
It’s really not a wasted reputation.

02:13.718 --> 02:14.477
Hello Mr. Guan

02:15.017 --> 02:16.197
This is your BMW

02:16.222 --> 02:16.861
it's beautiful

02:18.378 --> 02:19.636
Reporter Xu has a good eye

02:20.447 --> 02:21.745
Do you want to change into riding clothes?

02:21.778 --> 02:22.338
Come in and run two laps

02:22.697 --> 02:24.178
No, you're too polite

02:24.498 --> 02:25.737
Let’s do the interview first

02:27.537 --> 02:29.098
I think this place

02:30.058 --> 02:31.378
The environment is not suitable

02:31.498 --> 02:31.898
or

02:31.938 --> 02:33.417
Let me invite you out for a cup of coffee

02:34.697 --> 02:35.658
I also have coffee here

02:35.857 --> 02:36.537
Tastes good

02:41.137 --> 02:42.417
Let's start then

02:44.778 --> 02:45.417
I'm sorry

02:45.857 --> 02:46.737
I'll take a call first

02:46.817 --> 02:47.178
good

02:49.938 --> 02:50.417
Hello

02:51.458 --> 02:52.058
Guanji

02:53.058 --> 02:55.817
Guan Ji, come and save me

02:55.938 --> 02:56.697
I was fucked by my uncle

02:56.698 --> 02:58.178
Caught and thrown into jail

02:58.378 --> 02:59.058
my whole life

02:59.137 --> 03:00.857
I won't be happy anymore

03:01.378 --> 03:02.817
Xiaoyue, I advise you

03:02.898 --> 03:04.218
Or just take it as it comes

03:04.857 --> 03:05.817
This person is Shi Yan

03:05.818 --> 03:07.017
Looks like she's serious this time

03:07.338 --> 03:08.058
you know too

03:08.137 --> 03:09.178
Once he makes up his mind

03:09.577 --> 03:10.338
No one can change it

03:19.667 --> 03:20.577
banquet

03:20.817 --> 03:21.512
Maybe Guanji

03:21.537 --> 03:22.697
What a breakthrough

03:24.137 --> 03:24.817
Guanji

03:25.458 --> 03:26.417
You feel

03:26.857 --> 03:28.737
Me me

03:28.938 --> 03:30.378
I seem to be confused with the word work

03:30.577 --> 03:32.257
Is there anyone with whom I have a dime connection?

03:32.577 --> 03:34.378
I've never had a job

03:34.977 --> 03:36.297
But even if you don't work

03:36.537 --> 03:37.098
Shiyan won’t let you either

03:37.137 --> 03:37.857
Stay at home

03:38.458 --> 03:39.178
You

03:39.417 --> 03:40.297
Just calm down

03:41.178 --> 03:42.417
Just think of it as changing the environment and surfing the Internet.

03:43.658 --> 03:44.378
Play with mobile phone

03:44.817 --> 03:46.178
Time passed quickly

03:46.338 --> 03:47.178
Isn't there

03:47.219 --> 03:48.618
Is there any other way?

03:49.658 --> 03:52.537
I don't want to waste my youth here

03:54.218 --> 03:55.098
Princess Xiaoyue

03:55.697 --> 03:56.712
You should recognize the fact

03:56.737 --> 03:57.417
Give up your fantasy

03:57.938 --> 03:58.667
but

03:58.697 --> 03:59.778
I feel sorry for you

04:00.017 --> 04:00.737
Give you a word

04:01.417 --> 04:02.193
Since you have no choice

04:02.218 --> 04:03.017
Get the banquet

04:03.417 --> 04:04.577
It’s better to start somewhere else

04:05.378 --> 04:05.778
alright

04:05.938 --> 04:06.458
I have something else to do here

04:06.458 --> 04:07.137
I won’t tell you anymore

04:07.138 --> 04:08.178
what do you mean

04:09.058 --> 04:09.537
Hello

04:13.137 --> 04:14.338
Can't arrange a banquet

04:14.658 --> 04:15.257
I still can't figure it out

04:15.297 --> 04:16.909
Is this a horse lover?

04:17.098 --> 04:18.217
Is it only Zheng Shuyi?

04:18.218 --> 04:19.297
There are these means

04:24.338 --> 04:25.138
Mr. Guan

04:25.537 --> 04:26.258
Let's continue

04:27.977 --> 04:28.578
good

04:33.497 --> 04:34.338
What about people in the industry?

04:34.339 --> 04:36.177
Everyone praised Mr. Guan for being young and promising.

04:36.458 --> 04:37.057
I heard you will soon

04:37.177 --> 04:38.497
He's about to take over the Guan family.

04:38.898 --> 04:40.026
Presumably there will be later

04:40.051 --> 04:40.989
A lot of big moves

04:41.249 --> 04:42.689
I wonder if I can reveal a little bit about that?

04:44.177 --> 04:45.818
Guan will still maintain

04:45.898 --> 04:47.612
Based on the established industrial structure

04:47.658 --> 04:48.737
Let’s make some more innovations

04:51.417 --> 04:53.167
Mr. Guan really has a unique vision.

04:53.300 --> 04:55.698
Then I don’t know what happens next

04:56.018 --> 04:57.138
have you considered

04:57.163 --> 04:58.643
Introducing more talents?

05:00.658 --> 05:02.177
In fact, the competition of any enterprise

05:02.417 --> 05:03.377
fundamentally

05:03.458 --> 05:04.417
It’s all a competition for talent

05:05.098 --> 05:06.159
Companies like Guan's

05:06.377 --> 05:07.458
He is even more thirsty for talents.

05:08.377 --> 05:09.338
any time we

05:09.778 --> 05:10.977
All will look to outstanding talents

05:11.778 --> 05:12.537
open the door

05:24.011 --> 05:25.458
Thank you Mr. Guan for sharing

05:31.177 --> 05:31.737
Mr. Guan

05:32.658 --> 05:34.057
I have another personal question

05:34.177 --> 05:35.297
I would like to ask you something

05:37.250 --> 05:38.529
You want to ask me for my contact information?

05:39.098 --> 05:39.898
I will definitely say it

05:40.042 --> 05:41.042
To confirm the manuscript

05:43.937 --> 05:44.737
have no idea

05:45.177 --> 05:46.354
It’s inconvenient to leave you alone

05:46.392 --> 05:47.351
Contact information

05:47.578 --> 05:48.458
I'm doing it for the future

05:48.497 --> 05:49.497
Confirm the manuscript with you

05:58.658 --> 05:59.338
Mr. Guan’s horse

05:59.458 --> 06:00.658
He is really the best among horses.

06:00.818 --> 06:01.737
Such a character

06:02.977 --> 06:03.497
No

06:04.018 --> 06:05.377
It's just a little impatient

06:06.818 --> 06:07.458
Reporter Xu

06:07.937 --> 06:09.018
Nice to be interviewed by you

06:09.497 --> 06:10.352
I have something else to do here

06:10.377 --> 06:11.218
I'll arrange for someone to take you back

06:11.977 --> 06:12.898
Thank you Mr. Guan

06:15.857 --> 06:17.193
As expected, he only knows how to ride horses.

06:17.218 --> 06:18.417
The young man who picks up girls

06:19.177 --> 06:20.138
without your dad

06:20.497 --> 06:22.057
You are nothing yet

06:24.977 --> 06:25.776
Since you have no choice

06:25.801 --> 06:26.560
Get the banquet

06:26.977 --> 06:28.497
It’s better to start somewhere else

06:30.458 --> 06:32.218
Start somewhere else

06:33.537 --> 06:35.057
Where to start?

06:57.537 --> 06:58.138
Mr. Shi

06:59.937 --> 07:00.818
Already inquired

07:01.258 --> 07:02.338
Lieying’s funding comes from

07:03.377 --> 07:04.098
It's Mingyu

07:06.218 --> 07:07.138
you already know

07:09.698 --> 07:10.497
Didn't know

07:10.658 --> 07:11.497
Got it now

07:11.898 --> 07:12.737
Then now

07:13.937 --> 07:14.857
what should we do

07:16.057 --> 07:17.338
Whether to borrow or not is Mingyu’s business.

07:17.698 --> 07:18.258
We just need to do a good job

07:18.338 --> 07:19.057
Just your own

07:19.898 --> 07:20.537
you see you

07:20.818 --> 07:22.338
Do you want to give Mr. Qin a call?

07:22.497 --> 07:23.297
say hi

07:25.218 --> 07:26.698
Yu Qinglieying helped Mingyu

07:27.177 --> 07:28.617
returning a Favour many times more

07:29.297 --> 07:29.857
Yu Li

07:30.258 --> 07:31.898
Mingyu will not do loss-making business

07:32.537 --> 07:33.898
Can you lend me this money to Lieying?

07:34.458 --> 07:35.778
It shows that this deal is a good deal

07:36.258 --> 07:37.617
What reason do we have to stop it?

07:53.497 --> 07:53.977
calligraphy

07:54.377 --> 07:55.417
This is an intern from your group

07:55.778 --> 07:57.098
You guys should get acquainted with each other first

08:01.018 --> 08:01.578
Hello

08:01.698 --> 08:02.417
My name is Zheng Shuyi

08:02.617 --> 08:03.297
Happy cooperation

08:03.737 --> 08:04.098
Hello

08:04.218 --> 08:04.977
My name is Qin Shiyue

08:05.018 --> 08:05.857
Please give me more advice

08:08.138 --> 08:09.138
this is your place

08:09.297 --> 08:10.138
Put your things away

08:10.218 --> 08:10.857
tidy up

08:11.218 --> 08:11.857
OK

08:46.458 --> 08:47.857
That new intern

08:47.897 --> 08:48.578
Already played

08:48.617 --> 08:49.977
Been on the phone for over an hour

08:50.617 --> 08:51.777
I think she's quite confused

08:51.857 --> 08:52.458
How much do you give people

08:52.578 --> 08:53.698
Arrange something to do

08:54.938 --> 08:55.538
confused

08:56.737 --> 08:58.017
I see her having a lot of fun

09:56.497 --> 09:57.218
Sister Shuyi

09:57.938 --> 09:59.497
This is my meeting gift to you

09:59.857 --> 10:01.377
I just came to work and I didn’t understand anything.

10:01.617 --> 10:02.857
Please take good care of me in the future

10:06.698 --> 10:07.897
No need for gifts

10:09.377 --> 10:10.098
in the next few months

10:10.218 --> 10:11.017
What don't you understand?

10:11.178 --> 10:11.977
Feel free to ask me

10:12.888 --> 10:13.950
I'll give it to you now

10:13.984 --> 10:14.864
Arrange the work

10:16.058 --> 10:16.737
Now

10:18.737 --> 10:19.578
excuse me

10:19.938 --> 10:21.137
Don’t reach out to hit the smiling person

10:21.458 --> 10:22.338
I've given you gifts

10:22.418 --> 10:23.977
Why are you assigning work to me?

10:25.737 --> 10:27.017
Inside this recorder

10:27.098 --> 10:27.777
Some time ago

10:27.818 --> 10:28.977
One of my interview recordings

10:29.578 --> 10:30.257
Listen to it

10:30.349 --> 10:31.497
Put the questions and answers inside

10:31.538 --> 10:32.897
Sort it out one by one

10:33.338 --> 10:34.218
Learn to write a first draft

10:34.418 --> 10:35.178
Give it to me before get off work

10:36.657 --> 10:37.377
OK

11:00.857 --> 11:01.578
SY

11:02.298 --> 11:03.098
What a coincidence

11:04.857 --> 11:06.178
I still know how to take notes

11:06.657 --> 11:07.497
Not English

11:07.617 --> 11:08.377
That's Chinese

11:08.617 --> 11:10.178
At worst, listen to it a few more times

11:26.257 --> 11:27.697
The cooperation between Yunchuang and Guanshi

11:27.698 --> 11:29.058
Will it be officially announced soon?

11:29.458 --> 11:29.938
Next

11:30.017 --> 11:31.137
Should you get involved?

11:31.218 --> 11:32.897
Are there areas of common interest?

11:33.578 --> 11:34.298
What do you think about Guan?

11:34.338 --> 11:35.857
Why cooperate with Yunchuang

11:36.192 --> 11:37.418
What do you think of Yunchuang and Guanshi?

11:37.497 --> 11:38.418
what will do

11:39.298 --> 11:40.338
little uncle

11:41.698 --> 11:43.218
How can this be an interview?

11:44.178 --> 11:45.418
Isn't this just chatting?

11:45.578 --> 11:47.057
Is there any one-to-one correspondence problem?

11:47.058 --> 11:47.977
and answer

11:51.058 --> 11:52.617
two hours

11:54.178 --> 11:55.657
How could we chat for so long?

11:55.938 --> 11:57.016
He usually

11:57.017 --> 11:58.178
Cherish words like gold

12:12.657 --> 12:13.098
Hello

12:13.338 --> 12:14.122
Mr. Chen

12:14.617 --> 12:16.418
Help me please please

12:19.777 --> 12:20.137
good

12:20.298 --> 12:21.418
Received Miss Qin

12:21.657 --> 12:23.058
I'll try my best to take the time to help you sort it out.

12:23.737 --> 12:24.617
Then hurry up

12:24.731 --> 12:25.945
I need to submit the manuscript before I get off work

12:26.257 --> 12:27.578
thank you so much

12:28.497 --> 12:29.338
There will be a next time

12:29.818 --> 12:31.497
Come and be colleagues with Chen Sheng

12:46.977 --> 12:48.217
The entire contract follows the process

12:48.218 --> 12:48.897
Please wait a moment

12:48.977 --> 12:49.538
Mr. Shi

12:49.538 --> 12:50.298
You can't go in, Mr. Shi

12:50.338 --> 12:50.897
Mr. Shi

12:51.298 --> 12:52.058
Sorry, you two

12:52.137 --> 12:53.017
Uninvited

12:55.698 --> 12:57.298
Long time no see, Mr. Shi

12:57.657 --> 12:58.657
What's the matter with your sudden arrival?

12:59.818 --> 13:01.058
I'll finish talking to Mr. Chen first

13:01.218 --> 13:02.137
Let's talk later

13:04.008 --> 13:04.569
Talking about business

13:04.777 --> 13:05.418
I'm not here to stop

13:05.617 --> 13:06.338
Negotiated by two people

13:06.857 --> 13:07.458
But Mr. Chen

13:08.098 --> 13:08.857
I still want to give you one

13:09.058 --> 13:09.818
Sincere advice

13:10.257 --> 13:10.897
Not for the sake of the present

13:11.058 --> 13:11.698
temporary benefit

13:11.897 --> 13:12.737
and lost original intention

13:13.178 --> 13:14.777
and ruin Le'an's bright future.

13:19.497 --> 13:20.137
Mr. Shi

13:21.338 --> 13:22.578
I don't know how long I can last

13:22.938 --> 13:23.737
But this money is good for us

13:23.777 --> 13:24.458
too important

13:25.497 --> 13:26.218
Mr. Shi

13:26.777 --> 13:27.857
The source of this funding

13:27.897 --> 13:28.938
You also know

13:29.497 --> 13:30.538
Chen Kang, do you know?

13:30.818 --> 13:31.617
Mingyu gave it to you

13:31.618 --> 13:32.857
What is the interest on this money?

13:33.377 --> 13:34.257
Higher than normal interest rate

13:34.338 --> 13:35.098
Three full points

13:35.617 --> 13:36.058
this means

13:36.218 --> 13:37.418
Once you accept the money

13:37.657 --> 13:38.418
You will be with Lieying

13:38.497 --> 13:39.777
Bear this interest together

13:40.017 --> 13:41.298
What technical achievements do you value most?

13:41.338 --> 13:42.298
Will be cashed out as soon as possible

13:42.617 --> 13:43.257
technology R & D

13:43.258 --> 13:44.458
will also lose sustainability

13:44.938 --> 13:46.058
total hours

13:46.418 --> 13:47.617
You can't say that

13:47.897 --> 13:48.857
Liying and Yunchuang

13:48.938 --> 13:50.298
What matters most is Lean’s technology

13:50.698 --> 13:51.458
I want peace and harmony

13:51.538 --> 13:52.818
Develop together

13:53.377 --> 13:54.538
Once Lean is acquired

13:55.017 --> 13:56.257
You will lose your right to speak

13:56.538 --> 13:57.857
Your team will be with Lieying

13:58.058 --> 13:58.698
shoulder the burden together

13:58.777 --> 13:59.897
This high loan

14:00.017 --> 14:01.218
What about you and your team?

14:01.257 --> 14:02.777
Concentrate on overcoming technical problems

14:05.377 --> 14:06.698
Chip technology is a blue ocean

14:06.977 --> 14:07.897
I hope you won't do it because

14:07.938 --> 14:09.418
Making wrong decisions on impulse

14:10.857 --> 14:11.578
Mr. Shi

14:12.617 --> 14:13.338
our entire team

14:13.339 --> 14:14.657
After working hard for so many years

14:15.338 --> 14:17.338
While everyone is looking forward to the results

14:17.418 --> 14:18.298
Also hope

14:18.377 --> 14:19.418
Can have delicious bread

14:22.098 --> 14:23.538
I really get on well with you

14:24.657 --> 14:25.218
but

14:34.178 --> 14:35.338
During this time, I am happy

14:35.458 --> 14:36.938
Made a long-term plan

14:37.218 --> 14:38.458
I planned a fund pool

14:38.777 --> 14:39.578
can be done in stages

14:39.777 --> 14:41.418
Provide funding for Lean's research and development

14:42.098 --> 14:42.578
certainly

14:42.897 --> 14:44.178
The premise is that you also have confidence

14:44.218 --> 14:45.178
can continue to

14:45.298 --> 14:46.218
Continue research and development

14:48.338 --> 14:49.617
I can promise you today

14:50.017 --> 14:51.698
If Yunchuang invested in Lean

14:51.938 --> 14:52.737
So what about Lean Technology?

14:52.857 --> 14:53.617
Independence remains unchanged

14:53.938 --> 14:54.857
Strategy remains unchanged

14:55.017 --> 14:56.338
Your commitment to your employees remains unchanged

14:56.657 --> 14:58.098
The organizational structure remains unchanged

14:58.418 --> 14:58.977
In short

14:59.178 --> 14:59.657
Yunchuang’s investment

14:59.857 --> 15:01.298
Will not interfere or waver

15:01.338 --> 15:02.218
The development of Le'an

15:02.657 --> 15:03.377
hope you give the team

15:03.458 --> 15:04.617
While explaining

15:04.938 --> 15:05.578
Can also persist

15:05.617 --> 15:06.698
The original intention of starting your own business

15:15.298 --> 15:17.137
This me

15:19.538 --> 15:20.137
Mr. Chen

15:21.058 --> 15:21.977
you know attract a

15:22.058 --> 15:23.538
Is it a prerequisite for investors?

15:24.218 --> 15:24.857
not price

15:25.017 --> 15:25.578
Not a track

15:26.137 --> 15:27.337
Before that there is one more

15:27.338 --> 15:28.137
more important

15:29.857 --> 15:30.497
what is

15:30.938 --> 15:32.298
a sober manager

15:32.818 --> 15:33.737
Talent is an enterprise

15:33.857 --> 15:34.857
The most important factor

15:35.657 --> 15:37.017
You haven't reached the final desperate situation yet

15:37.418 --> 15:38.458
I hope you don't take yourself

15:38.538 --> 15:40.257
Throw away everything you have built with your own hands

15:40.657 --> 15:42.098
As long as you are willing to persist

15:42.578 --> 15:44.058
There are endless possibilities in Le'an

15:46.218 --> 15:47.058
Not long ago

15:47.497 --> 15:48.218
There is a reporter

15:48.219 --> 15:49.617
He also said something like this to me

15:53.777 --> 15:54.298
Mr. Shi

15:55.098 --> 15:56.218
I'm willing to give you some time

15:56.777 --> 15:57.897
Also give yourself some time

15:58.578 --> 15:59.377
Maybe Le'an

15:59.857 --> 16:00.977
There will be other options

16:04.257 --> 16:05.178
Sorry, Mr. Li

16:06.058 --> 16:07.098
Thanks Lieying for your generosity

16:08.098 --> 16:09.538
I think I still need a little time

16:09.938 --> 16:11.178
Think about our cooperation again

16:12.458 --> 16:13.377
I'm really sorry

16:57.538 --> 16:58.218
Completed Completed

16:58.338 --> 16:59.098
I worked hard

16:59.099 --> 17:00.377
It took me so long to write a manuscript

17:06.978 --> 17:07.897
Sister Shuyi

17:09.417 --> 17:10.338
Sister Shuyi

17:12.578 --> 17:13.417
Sister Shuyi

17:18.417 --> 17:19.657
Who is this?

17:26.417 --> 17:27.298
There will be a next time

17:27.818 --> 17:29.457
Come and be colleagues with Chen Sheng

17:54.377 --> 17:55.538
Let me introduce to you

17:55.818 --> 17:56.937
This is Cheng Beier

17:57.018 --> 17:58.563
Our new intern is here today

17:58.778 --> 17:59.978
Please take good care of me from now on.

18:00.538 --> 18:01.578
Hello everyone

18:02.217 --> 18:02.738
so young

18:03.177 --> 18:04.338
I heard he graduated from a famous school

18:05.137 --> 18:06.456
He's really a neat person

18:06.457 --> 18:07.217
girl

18:07.778 --> 18:09.657
I just don’t like working very much

18:12.137 --> 18:12.657
calligraphy

18:13.298 --> 18:14.457
Where is your intern?

18:14.778 --> 18:15.417
Why don't you come and follow us?

18:15.457 --> 18:16.177
Getting acquainted

18:18.217 --> 18:18.818
get off work

18:19.177 --> 18:20.018
So early

18:21.058 --> 18:22.177
Time to get off

18:22.298 --> 18:23.258
Naturally, I got off work

18:25.298 --> 18:26.778
Bei'er, let's go

18:27.137 --> 18:28.258
Let's continue working

18:28.937 --> 18:29.298
Let's go

18:29.457 --> 18:29.818
Let's go

18:30.058 --> 18:30.897
Wait for me, I'll clean it up

18:31.058 --> 18:31.457
OK

18:37.217 --> 18:38.217
I've asked about it

18:38.857 --> 18:40.058
This Cheng Beier?

18:40.298 --> 18:41.977
It ranks first in the country

18:41.978 --> 18:43.617
Graduated from a media school

18:44.377 --> 18:45.498
First place in professional category

18:45.897 --> 18:47.617
National Award for three consecutive years

18:48.177 --> 18:49.743
Double Major in Finance

18:49.857 --> 18:51.177
The paper also won an award

18:52.457 --> 18:54.217
How about comparing it with your second-generation ancestor?

18:55.058 --> 18:56.778
I'm not unbalanced at all

18:59.137 --> 19:01.058
Her family is also engaged in finance.

19:01.377 --> 19:02.338
Auntie still seems to be

19:02.377 --> 19:03.538
Mingyu’s executives

19:05.338 --> 19:06.338
This intern

19:06.738 --> 19:07.778
The background is so cool

19:08.177 --> 19:09.058
People are quite hardworking

19:09.697 --> 19:11.217
Work overtime on the first day of internship

19:13.338 --> 19:14.738
It makes me so stressed

19:19.298 --> 19:20.417
As long as I don't compare

19:21.217 --> 19:22.217
there will be no harm

19:26.177 --> 19:27.018
Come and eat more meat

19:27.298 --> 19:28.098
Increase protein

19:28.298 --> 19:28.818
good

19:29.137 --> 19:29.697
and this

19:29.937 --> 19:30.818
This is what you like to eat

19:31.298 --> 19:32.217
Eat more

19:32.937 --> 19:34.098
Grandpa, you don’t even know

19:34.137 --> 19:34.897
What's wrong

19:35.018 --> 19:37.177
I worked so hard today

19:37.457 --> 19:37.857
Yeah

19:37.978 --> 19:39.018
I almost died from exhaustion

19:39.657 --> 19:40.457
Dad, I'm back

19:41.417 --> 19:42.058
Eat quickly

19:52.258 --> 19:53.498
It turns out that the person who is about to die from exhaustion

19:53.617 --> 19:55.018
You can eat with such enthusiasm

19:57.738 --> 20:00.058
Grandpa, look at him

20:01.298 --> 20:02.818
I had such a hard day at work

20:03.177 --> 20:04.738
My uncle still wants to show my face

20:04.937 --> 20:05.978
Don't let me eat now

20:06.498 --> 20:07.377
Do you think I am him?

20:07.417 --> 20:08.338
My niece

20:10.217 --> 20:11.456
Not eating when eating

20:11.457 --> 20:12.137
what to do

20:12.978 --> 20:14.417
Don't be pushy in the company

20:14.617 --> 20:15.617
Take that set home

20:15.937 --> 20:17.477
To his own niece

20:18.697 --> 20:19.818
Grandpa still loves me

20:20.438 --> 20:22.118
My uncle may not be my biological uncle

20:22.217 --> 20:23.697
But grandpa must be close to grandpa

20:28.338 --> 20:28.897
By the way, the banquet

20:29.778 --> 20:30.498
I was about to ask you

20:31.417 --> 20:32.298
in a good way

20:33.419 --> 20:34.669
Why did you suddenly arrange for Xiaoyue?

20:34.694 --> 20:36.095
What kind of reporter are you going to do?

20:38.498 --> 20:39.392
She has graduated now

20:39.417 --> 20:40.417
You should go to work too

20:40.538 --> 20:41.457
She can't do anything else

20:41.778 --> 20:43.177
So I still ask Uncle Guan to ask my friends.

20:43.377 --> 20:44.377
Let her work in the magazine first

20:44.457 --> 20:45.578
Internship for a period of time

20:51.098 --> 20:52.338
How was your class today?

20:53.937 --> 20:55.258
Didn’t you hear everything?

20:56.018 --> 20:57.298
More than two hours of recording

20:57.338 --> 20:57.937
let me fight

20:58.377 --> 20:59.657
I'm not a typist

21:00.018 --> 21:01.338
I listened to that interview

21:01.818 --> 21:04.538
What kind of interview? It’s just small talk.

21:06.258 --> 21:07.338
Let you type

21:09.457 --> 21:10.697
Who is your leader?

21:11.738 --> 21:13.338
The surname Zheng is a female

21:15.857 --> 21:16.377
Zheng Shuyi

21:16.818 --> 21:18.058
Yes, that's her

21:33.617 --> 21:34.338
Arrange work for you

21:34.377 --> 21:35.217
Just do it well

21:35.538 --> 21:36.617
Since you are the leader

21:36.778 --> 21:37.617
Just be humble

21:37.738 --> 21:38.897
Learn from others well

21:41.498 --> 21:42.818
I thought so too

21:43.258 --> 21:44.657
But are you willing to teach me?

21:45.818 --> 21:46.617
What should I say?

21:47.778 --> 21:48.578
I'm thinking

21:49.177 --> 21:50.937
If you don’t understand, it’s never wrong to ask.

21:52.098 --> 21:52.697
But today

21:52.937 --> 21:54.457
I wanted to ask her several times

21:54.937 --> 21:56.058
She didn't even raise her eyes

21:56.137 --> 21:57.457
completely ignore me

21:58.018 --> 21:59.417
I thought she was busy at work

21:59.457 --> 22:01.058
I just wanted to ask her for advice after get off work.

22:01.417 --> 22:02.857
But I waited for more than half an hour

22:03.058 --> 22:04.217
I have to leave

22:04.457 --> 22:05.778
She didn't even look at me

22:07.778 --> 22:09.897
Bullying newcomers in the workplace like this

22:10.417 --> 22:11.738
Isn’t it not good?

22:15.778 --> 22:16.538
Eat dad

22:19.578 --> 22:20.617
Is there any uncle?

22:20.657 --> 22:22.857
Did you receive my bad radio wave?

22:25.697 --> 22:27.217
Why are there so many people today?

22:28.417 --> 22:29.417
Go in, go in, hurry up

22:29.738 --> 22:30.498
Sit inside

22:31.538 --> 22:32.058
sit

22:32.897 --> 22:33.417
sit

22:34.585 --> 22:36.384
This is Mr. Guan from Guan Capital

22:36.578 --> 22:37.844
we often play together

22:37.897 --> 22:38.818
Good luck, Mr. Guan. Good luck, Mr. Guan.

22:39.137 --> 22:40.018
Let’s get to know each other

22:48.338 --> 22:49.058
Come to Guan for a drink

22:49.137 --> 22:49.778
Come to Mr. Guan

22:53.457 --> 22:55.189
Mr. Guan, please add WeChat

22:55.214 --> 22:56.415
Let’s hang out together later

22:56.778 --> 22:57.857
Yes, add one more

22:58.778 --> 22:59.818
I

23:01.258 --> 23:02.137
I asked you why you took so long

23:02.137 --> 23:02.857
Not coming out yet

23:03.137 --> 23:04.417
I've been waiting for you in the car for a long time

23:06.018 --> 23:06.818
sorry baby

23:07.978 --> 23:08.897
I have to go first

23:19.818 --> 23:20.778
Look how popular I am

23:20.857 --> 23:21.578
Not happy anymore

23:23.937 --> 23:24.897
I just know too well

23:24.922 --> 23:25.978
To those who don’t call

23:26.018 --> 23:27.177
feeling of being entangled

23:27.657 --> 23:28.417
That's why

23:28.697 --> 23:30.177
I will act righteously to help you out.

23:31.578 --> 23:32.897
How do you know I won't call?

23:35.377 --> 23:36.738
That's because I'm meddling in other people's business

23:37.298 --> 23:38.018
I go first

23:40.417 --> 23:41.177
I send you

23:43.617 --> 23:44.457
You still have so much

23:44.498 --> 23:45.778
Where is the female companion who called?

23:46.657 --> 23:47.578
No more trouble

23:49.457 --> 23:51.098
I only have you

23:51.818 --> 23:52.617
female companion

24:14.738 --> 24:15.578
Done

24:42.538 --> 24:44.098
The editor-in-chief and I have read the manuscript.

24:44.217 --> 24:45.137
no problem

24:45.298 --> 24:46.377
Already sent to Shiyan

24:46.417 --> 24:47.058
Wait for his reply

24:47.818 --> 24:48.657
well written

24:51.298 --> 24:52.617
Thank you editor-in-chief and editor-in-chief

25:01.338 --> 25:02.298
If it can be added

25:02.338 --> 25:03.617
Just use Shiyan WeChat

25:04.857 --> 25:05.978
I don’t know about the topic either.

25:06.137 --> 25:07.338
yes or no

25:08.778 --> 25:09.937
If you could ask him directly

25:09.978 --> 25:10.738
Enough

25:15.857 --> 25:16.338
dad

25:17.018 --> 25:17.697
drink tea

25:19.897 --> 25:20.697
It is said that

25:21.098 --> 25:22.697
You went horse riding on the weekend

25:24.177 --> 25:25.538
I also brought a girl with me

25:29.217 --> 25:30.177
Lao Guan said

25:30.258 --> 25:31.697
You haven't been there for a long time

25:32.697 --> 25:33.897
Are you busy at work lately?

25:37.098 --> 25:38.457
Busy with things at Lean Technology

25:41.377 --> 25:42.457
I heard something

25:44.578 --> 25:45.338
Takaaki

25:45.857 --> 25:47.137
I'm also busy with Lieying's affairs.

25:48.298 --> 25:48.897
I know

25:49.217 --> 25:49.778
before i eat

25:49.897 --> 25:50.937
Just came back from Lean Technology

25:51.457 --> 25:52.937
Mingyu's efficiency is indeed very high

25:53.258 --> 25:54.417
When I went there in the afternoon

25:54.738 --> 25:55.818
Lieying has already gone over to chat

25:57.377 --> 25:59.058
Do you need to talk to your brother-in-law?

26:00.217 --> 26:01.058
Originally he wanted it today too

26:01.137 --> 26:02.058
Came back for dinner

26:02.578 --> 26:03.738
But deal with it temporarily

26:03.778 --> 26:04.897
It’s Lieying’s business

26:08.538 --> 26:09.617
Talking about business

26:09.897 --> 26:10.857
The interest given by Lieying

26:10.897 --> 26:11.818
indeed attractive

26:12.177 --> 26:13.298
There's nothing wrong with what my brother-in-law did.

26:13.578 --> 26:14.217
I understand

26:15.098 --> 26:15.937
in other words

26:16.738 --> 26:17.857
If Lean Technology

26:18.137 --> 26:19.377
Acquired by Lieying

26:19.457 --> 26:20.177
attracted

26:20.738 --> 26:21.937
Then I have to reevaluate it too

26:22.018 --> 26:22.978
This company

26:23.177 --> 26:23.937
Is that what I want

26:24.018 --> 26:25.098
A long-term cooperative company

26:28.338 --> 26:29.818
Mingyu was founded

26:30.498 --> 26:32.578
It has been twenty-three years now

26:34.058 --> 26:35.538
these uncles of yours

26:36.177 --> 26:37.577
It was also very popular back then

26:37.578 --> 26:39.417
Business acumen and means

26:40.298 --> 26:42.298
They are also very affectionate and righteous

26:42.978 --> 26:44.937
I went through it with Mingyu

26:45.098 --> 26:46.217
Strong wind and waves

26:46.897 --> 26:47.937
sometimes

26:49.137 --> 26:50.377
their thoughts

26:51.457 --> 26:52.778
You have to listen too

26:54.177 --> 26:55.377
At this stage of your life

26:55.937 --> 26:57.177
Still need to continue

26:57.298 --> 26:58.857
Learn and strengthen yourself

26:59.498 --> 27:00.738
Even if they think

27:00.857 --> 27:02.098
different from you

27:02.818 --> 27:03.657
cannot be

27:03.697 --> 27:05.258
Help you in your career

27:05.778 --> 27:06.617
but

27:06.937 --> 27:09.498
Nor should you let them be

27:09.697 --> 27:12.177
Obstacles in your path

27:13.697 --> 27:14.377
I know dad

27:14.897 --> 27:15.738
It's getting late

27:16.538 --> 27:17.538
Go back early

27:18.657 --> 27:19.298
Thank you dad

27:20.058 --> 27:21.217
Then I'll go back first

27:23.377 --> 27:24.258
Go to bed early dad

27:24.258 --> 27:24.897
good

27:54.697 --> 27:55.377
Professor Yu

27:55.897 --> 27:56.897
Do you have time in the next two days?

27:57.457 --> 27:58.578
I'm going rock climbing in two days

27:59.098 --> 28:00.417
Do you want to relax together?

28:00.978 --> 28:01.617
rock climbing

28:02.377 --> 28:03.538
Are you sure this is relaxing?

28:04.857 --> 28:05.657
Send me the address

28:06.457 --> 28:07.098
no problem

28:51.457 --> 28:52.738
The manuscript was approved so quickly

28:54.818 --> 28:55.538
not last night

28:55.578 --> 28:56.498
Did you just send it?

28:57.377 --> 28:58.217
Editor-in-Chief and Editor-in-Chief

28:58.258 --> 28:59.592
I replied last night

28:59.617 --> 29:00.557
they are all satisfied

29:00.657 --> 29:01.697
Already sent to Yunchuang

29:03.903 --> 29:04.663
Little uncle

29:05.098 --> 29:06.696
Prove that you are my biological uncle

29:06.697 --> 29:07.578
the time has come

29:10.818 --> 29:11.578
Good morning, Shiyue

29:13.258 --> 29:14.098
morning

29:19.217 --> 29:19.778
Sister Tiantian

29:19.778 --> 29:20.377
Please help me take a look

29:20.377 --> 29:21.177
Is it okay to write like this?

29:21.298 --> 29:21.617
good

29:22.897 --> 29:23.857
How to deal with this?

29:24.338 --> 29:25.018
Satsuki

29:25.498 --> 29:27.338
Don't be in such a hurry to eat breakfast

29:27.498 --> 29:28.578
prone to indigestion

29:36.818 --> 29:37.417
How about it

29:37.818 --> 29:38.937
Mingyu’s response to your manuscript

29:39.018 --> 29:40.738
Isn’t that a lot of praise?

29:50.857 --> 29:52.177
why not pass

29:53.065 --> 29:54.592
There's nothing wrong with this, either.

29:54.617 --> 29:55.657
what does it mean

29:57.137 --> 29:59.617
Uncle's love is like a mountain

30:44.578 --> 30:45.018
calligraphy

30:45.617 --> 30:46.657
Your group’s topic selection for this week

30:46.738 --> 30:47.617
There’s no need to report it now

30:48.217 --> 30:49.457
Let’s finish the manuscript for the banquet first

30:50.498 --> 30:50.978
Yuling

30:51.217 --> 30:51.832
You weren't before

30:51.857 --> 30:53.033
Have you ever interviewed Guan Ji?

30:53.177 --> 30:54.738
Be prepared to top up at any time

30:55.018 --> 30:55.697
good editor

30:56.738 --> 30:57.338
calligraphy

30:57.857 --> 30:58.738
I see how you look lately

30:58.778 --> 30:59.457
Not good either

30:59.498 --> 31:00.697
The body is the capital of revolution

31:01.058 --> 31:02.177
Don't put too much pressure on yourself

31:02.778 --> 31:04.177
Okay, let's break up the meeting

31:06.137 --> 31:06.778
calligraphy

31:07.217 --> 31:08.018
You stay for a while

31:14.857 --> 31:16.137
what happened

31:16.417 --> 31:17.098
Is it among you

31:17.137 --> 31:17.978
during the interview

31:18.498 --> 31:19.617
What's so unpleasant about it?

31:21.018 --> 31:21.937
It shouldn't be

31:23.498 --> 31:24.657
I should be the unhappy one

31:24.937 --> 31:26.017
He was knocked half to death while riding a horse

31:26.018 --> 31:26.738
also me

31:27.098 --> 31:28.258
What's so unpleasant about him?

31:30.217 --> 31:31.818
What's going on?

31:32.217 --> 31:33.417
So far, there is a clear

31:33.457 --> 31:34.818
No comments for modification

31:36.098 --> 31:36.818
Where are you and Yunchuang?

31:36.897 --> 31:38.258
Communicate well

31:38.657 --> 31:39.538
let them give some

31:39.538 --> 31:40.377
clear opinion

31:41.058 --> 31:42.018
Change it as soon as possible

31:42.657 --> 31:43.457
I see

31:44.778 --> 31:45.617
After all, the banquet is also

31:45.657 --> 31:46.978
first interview

31:47.258 --> 31:48.578
We don't know him well enough either

31:49.137 --> 31:50.617
Maybe he has his own requirements

31:51.538 --> 31:52.857
You still have to try your best to find a way

31:52.978 --> 31:53.818
satisfy him

31:54.177 --> 31:55.778
The deadline is coming soon

31:57.098 --> 31:57.897
It's really not possible

31:58.738 --> 31:59.897
Send him a WeChat message

32:00.338 --> 32:01.377
say something nice

32:01.897 --> 32:03.018
Ask Shi Yan himself

32:07.578 --> 32:08.377
What's wrong

32:09.217 --> 32:10.177
I'm sorry

32:10.578 --> 32:11.657
This isn't like you

32:13.217 --> 32:14.657
How could I be embarrassed?

32:15.137 --> 32:15.978
I don’t have his WeChat account

32:19.298 --> 32:20.177
Didn't you tell me earlier?

32:22.377 --> 32:23.818
This is Shi Yan’s mobile phone number

32:24.177 --> 32:24.978
I send it to you

32:26.778 --> 32:27.578
Go ask him

32:27.978 --> 32:28.937
Tell people well

32:30.538 --> 32:31.217
Take a look

32:38.538 --> 32:39.937
Where did I offend him?

32:41.657 --> 32:42.857
Even if I offend him

32:42.978 --> 32:44.137
work is work

32:44.538 --> 32:45.697
You can't be so petty, right?

32:58.258 --> 32:58.857
Come up

33:42.897 --> 33:43.818
Didn't expect that

33:44.258 --> 33:45.657
Mr. Shi is quite good at rock climbing.

33:49.738 --> 33:50.258
Walk

34:01.657 --> 34:03.033
So you are following now

34:03.058 --> 34:04.098
Your parent company is in the ring

34:05.377 --> 34:06.098
not completely

34:07.137 --> 34:08.137
Once Mingyu transfers the funds,

34:08.217 --> 34:08.978
Lend to Lieying

34:09.378 --> 34:10.137
Regardless of the strong shadow

34:10.177 --> 34:11.137
Whether to acquire Lean

34:11.657 --> 34:12.578
All with interest

34:12.657 --> 34:13.617
Give it back to Mingyu

34:14.418 --> 34:15.173
In principle

34:15.498 --> 34:17.168
The competition between Yunchuang and Lieying

34:17.193 --> 34:17.833
is not harmful

34:17.858 --> 34:18.817
parent company's interests

34:19.737 --> 34:20.657
In the long term

34:20.898 --> 34:21.817
Yunchuang Investment Le'an

34:22.098 --> 34:23.217
Mingyu also made a profit

34:25.297 --> 34:26.217
So you hope

34:26.458 --> 34:27.617
I'll put you in touch with Bruce.

34:28.697 --> 34:29.177
Yes

34:29.697 --> 34:30.617
I checked his information

34:30.898 --> 34:31.978
You were alumni

34:32.257 --> 34:32.978
Also colleagues

34:33.257 --> 34:34.018
So this is busy

34:34.257 --> 34:35.418
Please help me

34:36.617 --> 34:37.617
Actually I want to contact him

34:37.617 --> 34:38.257
Not difficult

34:38.498 --> 34:39.737
But I want him to join Lean

34:39.817 --> 34:40.737
There is still a certain degree of difficulty

34:41.297 --> 34:42.498
As far as I know there were many before

34:42.657 --> 34:43.458
Domestic and foreign companies

34:43.498 --> 34:44.538
They all set very high conditions.

34:44.657 --> 34:45.458
come and invite him

34:46.058 --> 34:46.817
But none of them really

34:46.898 --> 34:47.817
Impress Bruce

34:48.657 --> 34:49.378
He always felt

34:49.538 --> 34:50.858
In the school's research room

34:51.098 --> 34:52.217
It can make him focus more

34:52.538 --> 34:53.898
You can also get more inspiration

34:54.858 --> 34:55.913
So if this matter

34:55.938 --> 34:57.217
very important to you

34:57.498 --> 34:58.378
my suggestion is

34:58.617 --> 35:00.177
Consider other experts

35:02.898 --> 35:04.297
Millimeter wave communications

35:04.498 --> 35:05.297
Professor Bruce

35:05.337 --> 35:06.297
It's very authoritative

35:06.578 --> 35:07.978
The problems facing Lean now

35:08.018 --> 35:09.098
if he can't solve it

35:09.337 --> 35:10.657
Then it will be difficult for others to solve it

35:11.177 --> 35:11.858
and

35:12.098 --> 35:13.337
Overcome this technical problem

35:13.617 --> 35:14.297
Significant

35:14.697 --> 35:15.297
This is not only

35:15.337 --> 35:16.657
Business considerations

35:18.337 --> 35:19.498
Since you said so

35:20.177 --> 35:21.217
Then I'll try my best

35:22.978 --> 35:23.697
Imprinted in the heart

35:24.217 --> 35:25.297
Then I'm waiting for your good news

35:26.058 --> 35:26.538
good

35:28.337 --> 35:29.257
Do you want to compete again?

35:29.538 --> 35:30.538
See who reaches the top first

35:32.137 --> 35:32.858
sure

35:33.177 --> 35:34.337
I won't let you

36:01.217 --> 36:02.058
Hello Mr. Shi

36:02.098 --> 36:03.177
I am Zheng Shuyi

36:03.697 --> 36:04.817
I'm sorry to bother you

36:04.898 --> 36:06.176
I want to ask you something

36:06.177 --> 36:07.737
Questions about this manuscript

36:07.817 --> 36:08.697
Looking forward to reply

36:08.898 --> 36:09.858
Thanks

36:34.217 --> 36:35.737
He is muted

36:36.018 --> 36:37.657
Or do not disturb mode?

36:39.217 --> 36:40.378
Still blocked me

36:42.058 --> 36:42.817
still

36:43.137 --> 36:44.297
Do not answer unknown calls

36:47.058 --> 36:48.657
A mobile phone worth several thousand yuan

36:48.938 --> 36:50.418
I was stunned that I didn’t receive a reply.

36:51.098 --> 36:52.018
What's the use of you

37:07.898 --> 37:08.697
Mr. Chen

37:10.217 --> 37:11.457
please can you help me

37:11.458 --> 37:12.498
Do you always want to say something to me?

37:13.538 --> 37:14.217
Is such that

37:14.538 --> 37:16.538
I have some personal emergencies

37:16.697 --> 37:17.458
Want to find him

37:18.378 --> 37:19.217
always busy

37:19.578 --> 37:20.378
Wait until he is done

37:20.418 --> 37:21.578
I'll go talk to him first

37:21.777 --> 37:22.617
Will reply to you again

37:23.697 --> 37:24.617
OK, thanks

37:34.378 --> 37:34.938
Mr. Shi

37:36.257 --> 37:36.858
It seems that today

37:36.858 --> 37:37.737
Rock climbing is good

37:45.617 --> 37:46.337
Not long ago

37:46.737 --> 37:48.058
A reporter also told me

37:48.098 --> 37:48.898
Such words

37:53.697 --> 37:54.458
what you want to say

37:55.297 --> 37:56.217
Reporter Zheng from financial agency

37:56.257 --> 37:57.098
let me tell you

37:57.297 --> 37:58.617
She has a personal emergency and comes to you

37:59.978 --> 38:00.657
private

38:01.217 --> 38:01.777
Urgent matter

38:02.458 --> 38:03.337
She said she would call you

38:03.418 --> 38:04.418
No one answered

38:04.657 --> 38:06.498
I see she seems quite anxious

38:09.098 --> 38:10.177
She didn't say specifically.

38:10.378 --> 38:11.217
It’s hard for me to ask

38:11.858 --> 38:13.578
Why don't you call her back?

38:15.858 --> 38:17.297
Do you think I should call her?

38:18.098 --> 38:19.257
Then I will reject her right now

38:20.737 --> 38:21.458
Wait a moment

38:23.378 --> 38:23.938
Let's go

38:29.737 --> 38:30.297
Walk

38:37.498 --> 38:38.617
Mr. Shi said

38:38.817 --> 38:40.737

Working hours and occasions

38:57.098 --> 38:58.137
Don't talk about personal matters

38:59.058 --> 38:59.978
What's the meaning

39:01.378 --> 39:03.177

But is he willing to stay?

41:43.098 --> 41:44.378
Try to convince him when we meet

41:45.578 --> 41:46.898
Then I wish you good luck first

41:55.297 --> 41:55.858
Wait a moment
