01:31.202 --> 01:36.166
"Only for love"

01:36.247 --> 01:39.068
Part (3)

01:47.613 --> 01:50.286
(The reporter has arrived for the introduction of Director Xi Sangyu
)

01:51.997 --> 01:53.277
Isn't it one o'clock in the afternoon?

01:53.357 --> 01:55.316
(He arrived early,
so I'll make him wait)

01:55.397 --> 01:57.371
No need, ask him to come in

02:25.133 --> 02:26.392
Hello, Director Xi

02:35.275 --> 02:36.615
you..

02:36.975 --> 02:39.129
My name is Xu Yuling, a reporter from Financial Introduction

02:39.210 --> 02:40.762
My colleague
can't come today because he has some business

02:40.843 --> 02:42.956
So I
was transferred to do this interview

02:46.437 --> 02:47.577
Thank you

02:53.637 --> 02:55.156
So let's get started, director

02:55.259 --> 02:56.519
Wait a minute, reporter gold

02:56.677 --> 02:58.656
Can I see your draft?

02:59.917 --> 03:01.097
Got it

03:14.922 --> 03:17.140
(Draft interview for Xian)

03:22.477 --> 03:23.870
So let's get started

03:32.872 --> 03:36.053
Min Yu Yun Chum is
a subsidiary company of Min Yu Group

03:36.134 --> 03:38.356
From the most influential appraisal firm in the field

03:38.437 --> 03:40.224
He is rated AA

03:40.305 --> 03:41.521
Because of his promising vision

03:41.602 --> 03:44.162
It even raised the parent company's reliability standards

03:44.268 --> 03:46.389
Yun Chum's future is really
promising

03:46.540 --> 03:49.259
The main speaker of this interview is
Min Yu Yunchum

03:49.339 --> 03:51.922
Development plan and necessary preparation for the next five years

03:52.039 --> 03:54.955
including his role under the parent company

03:55.036 --> 03:56.180
Other related questions

03:56.277 --> 03:58.117
First I want to ask

03:58.180 --> 04:02.093
The director's point of view when he founded Min Yu Yun Chum

04:03.179 --> 04:04.519
Subscribe to this

04:06.327 --> 04:07.347
Hello

04:07.779 --> 04:09.810
Hello, I'm a financial
reporter

04:09.891 --> 04:11.107
Register first

04:17.037 --> 04:19.850
Are all the reporters at your magazine
beautiful like you?

04:27.507 --> 04:29.298
(Xu Yu Lin)

04:30.237 --> 04:33.210
(Why is Xu Yuling's name in the guest log ?)

04:36.957 --> 04:38.218
Thank you

04:47.197 --> 04:48.345
Secretary Chan

04:49.557 --> 04:50.707
About the reporter

04:51.828 --> 04:54.056
Interview with director Xi scheduled for an hour today

04:54.137 --> 04:55.362
Did it go according to plan?

04:55.619 --> 04:57.056
You have an issue, don't you?

04:57.142 --> 04:59.322
Your colleague
has already done the interview for you

04:59.512 --> 05:02.522
He came at lunchtime,
which is when Director Xi is busy

05:02.727 --> 05:05.777
He also said that you gave him away

05:08.357 --> 05:11.101
Sorry , there was a disconnection in our group

05:12.376 --> 05:13.722
I'm tired of coming this far

05:13.845 --> 05:15.105
I'm not tired

05:15.717 --> 05:16.976
But..

06:05.517 --> 06:08.276
I have an appointment with the director Xi My Shin
this afternoon

06:08.357 --> 06:10.220
Director Xi has to go outside, so
I will return to the reporter

06:10.301 --> 06:11.922
The interview is over today

06:12.050 --> 06:14.017
I have been waiting for this interview for a long time

06:14.132 --> 06:15.722
I got the chance today

06:15.938 --> 06:18.008
Is it okay now?

06:20.540 --> 06:24.522
Director Xi has moderated the basic part of the interview

06:24.775 --> 06:26.817
But five questions about Yun Chum's future

06:26.898 --> 06:28.482
You still haven't answered

06:36.877 --> 06:39.237
It will only take a little time

06:39.426 --> 06:40.607
May I

06:41.477 --> 06:43.228
What are those five questions?

06:46.894 --> 06:50.036
Question 1 : As a subsidiary company of Min Yu Group

06:50.117 --> 06:52.556
Operated independently from the parent company

06:52.637 --> 06:54.667
Do you have plans to expand into larger markets?

06:55.798 --> 06:59.158
Question 2: Regarding the cooperation between Kuen Group and Yun Chum

06:59.269 --> 07:02.308
Besides looking to invest in more innovative areas

07:02.396 --> 07:04.522
Any other long-term plans?

07:04.650 --> 07:08.537
Question 3 : Is it your plan to return to China for Professor Yuyo ?

07:22.456 --> 07:24.673
This is your first personal interview

07:24.759 --> 07:28.190
It is the first step towards understanding Yun Chum's exterior

07:28.717 --> 07:30.269
So..

07:32.340 --> 07:33.522
i believe

07:33.603 --> 07:35.087
The media and the public

07:35.168 --> 07:38.522
Won't you allow me to understand Yun Chum more deeply?

07:40.146 --> 07:41.235
followed

07:54.117 --> 07:55.297
Director Xi

07:55.446 --> 07:57.922
Can I ask, we are going now..

08:13.557 --> 08:15.642
(Ask my uncle to pick up the phone)

08:19.557 --> 08:21.642
(Little God?)

08:22.917 --> 08:25.627
I told him that if he doesn't listen,
don't come in front of me again

08:27.811 --> 08:31.520
You heard what Director Xi said

08:33.989 --> 08:35.562
(Very influential)

08:35.783 --> 08:36.885
(If it is so influential)

08:36.966 --> 08:39.922
(Why don't you teach yourself
not to be a mistress)

08:56.468 --> 08:57.488
Director Xi

08:57.748 --> 08:59.899
Driver Fan
is waiting in a commercial vehicle

09:00.611 --> 09:01.912
Ask him to come

09:02.412 --> 09:04.751
The reporter
might want to sit in this car

09:05.259 --> 09:06.438
Am I?

09:13.045 --> 09:15.642
They said in the car that I have to drive for two hours

09:19.861 --> 09:23.091
Didn't you say you could use the time in the car earlier ?

09:23.850 --> 09:25.525
Of course, no problem

09:26.676 --> 09:28.740
(You can also say under the car)

09:30.291 --> 09:31.511
Director Xi

09:39.633 --> 09:42.965
( I don't think I should interview Shi Xian in this way )

10:07.476 --> 10:08.801
(trust me)

10:08.893 --> 10:12.014
(Xiang is
a man too)

10:12.142 --> 10:14.082
(A man cannot refuse such an approach )

10:48.420 --> 10:50.525
(Isn't the Shanshan method useless?)

10:55.531 --> 10:56.632
Is it cold?

11:00.634 --> 11:01.642
It's not cold

11:02.313 --> 11:04.522
Put down the torch

11:05.082 --> 11:06.381
Well done, Director Xi

11:18.133 --> 11:21.202
(Just saying I'm not cold
doesn't mean I'm hot)

11:22.637 --> 11:24.242
My time is limited

11:33.101 --> 11:35.780
Director Xi Before we officially start

11:35.884 --> 11:38.835
Let's talk about the other first
, so it's easy

11:40.983 --> 11:42.282
What do you want to say?

11:42.597 --> 11:45.037
Director Xi will certainly
rarely accept an interview

11:45.117 --> 11:49.217
Usually, before we start the interview,
we get to know the interviewee a little bit

11:50.629 --> 11:52.298
So let's introduce ourselves

11:53.557 --> 11:55.887
We should get to know each other a little

11:57.869 --> 12:00.150
I am a reporter from Keng Shuyi's
financial introduction

12:00.237 --> 12:02.907
I am really honored to interview Director Xi today

12:02.988 --> 12:06.028
Shi Xiang, 27,
is the CEO of Min Yu Yun Chum

12:06.131 --> 12:08.842
(Why do I think of such a bad method ?)

12:09.940 --> 12:12.211
Director Xi is really
young and promising

12:15.557 --> 12:17.348
(I just said this)

12:18.309 --> 12:20.989
In fact, I was waiting for you at Wanara Farm the first time

12:21.108 --> 12:22.858
I was really lucky

12:23.421 --> 12:26.330
I heard that
director Shao Kuon of the Kuon group will also be there

12:26.542 --> 12:27.861
Because you and he are close

12:27.972 --> 12:29.482
Enough to encourage

12:29.562 --> 12:31.856
Although he said that he rarely attends such events

12:31.937 --> 12:33.846
I can't tell if fate
favors me

12:34.292 --> 12:37.372
Anyway, for our journalists,
publication day is a holiday

12:37.506 --> 12:39.465
Unfortunately, I was really lucky

12:39.546 --> 12:42.199
I didn't get the chance to interview you, but
I got the chance to meet you

12:42.500 --> 12:44.512
So, the cooperation between Shin and the Ku group

12:44.593 --> 12:46.039
Will it be officially announced soon?

12:46.120 --> 12:49.626
Are you going to expand into areas of mutual interest ?

13:04.660 --> 13:07.926
Director Xi, what did I say wrong?

13:09.940 --> 13:12.381
Why do you think Kum Group
wants to join Yun Chum?

13:12.462 --> 13:15.131
What do you think Yun Chum and Kum Group will do?

13:49.758 --> 13:51.202
Have you finished asking?

14:00.637 --> 14:03.112
Director Xi, I have one more question

14:03.572 --> 14:06.008
Why didn't you
stay at Min Yu Group at that time?

14:06.089 --> 14:07.808
Did you choose to start your own business?

14:07.970 --> 14:10.320
Did your father support your decision?

14:16.686 --> 14:18.522
I am getting old

14:19.877 --> 14:23.122
I can't handle many things anymore

14:23.402 --> 14:27.752
This time, Min Yu was able to survive
thanks to some old friends

14:29.012 --> 14:30.472
Min Yu's future

14:31.397 --> 14:32.736
It depends on you

14:34.699 --> 14:36.929
In fact, my husband is
more suitable than me

14:37.837 --> 14:39.337
But your lineage is Xi

14:39.717 --> 14:41.827
Yu Yu needs you

14:42.388 --> 14:44.328
Her husband is a member of the Xi family

14:44.409 --> 14:47.789
I still want to do something meaningful and
happy for myself

14:47.997 --> 14:49.017
How do you..

14:51.195 --> 14:52.986
Have you thought it through?

14:53.393 --> 14:54.573
I have thought it through

14:54.831 --> 14:56.091
This road..

14:56.630 --> 14:58.949
It will be very difficult

14:59.059 --> 15:00.359
I know

15:00.905 --> 15:02.226
But someone
has to step up

15:02.317 --> 15:03.317
You..

15:18.221 --> 15:19.849
I will be retiring soon

15:20.357 --> 15:22.347
The house is the car

15:22.917 --> 15:24.717
You will not need to use the latter

15:25.757 --> 15:27.137
You take it

15:29.009 --> 15:30.228
Thank you, father

15:35.859 --> 15:37.066
Two hours have passed

16:07.997 --> 16:09.418
You can return now

16:13.304 --> 16:15.802
( How do you get back from such a remote place ?)

16:15.980 --> 16:17.530
(Do you have to ride a horse?)

16:18.300 --> 16:21.362
(Shi Xian is very angry)

16:21.518 --> 16:25.078
( I want you to give up in this remote place )

16:25.260 --> 16:26.680
(absolutely impossible)

16:28.445 --> 16:32.274
(I came by this car
and must return with this car)

16:34.597 --> 16:37.502
Director Xi Sing's voice
is very good to listen to

16:37.610 --> 16:38.885
Through some of your answers

16:38.966 --> 16:41.362
Can we use it as an audio file in our digital magazine ?

16:44.633 --> 16:46.854
I want to have my full view

16:48.037 --> 16:49.302
So it means that I got it

16:51.317 --> 16:52.396
Wait a minute, Director Xi

16:52.492 --> 16:54.003
I have one last question

16:55.213 --> 16:56.233
say

16:57.077 --> 16:59.186
Do you have a girlfriend?

17:13.797 --> 17:17.157
This question is
to satisfy the curiosity of our readers

17:17.237 --> 17:19.876
It doesn't matter if Director Xi doesn't want to answer

17:22.471 --> 17:23.897
Actually, my last question

17:23.978 --> 17:25.922
A young investment company like Min Yu Yun Chum

17:26.003 --> 17:27.362
Why did you decide to invest in Le Ann technology ?

17:27.477 --> 17:29.637
Because the long-term research and development chain
will not be immediately profitable

17:29.718 --> 17:31.198
Aren't you worried?

17:33.743 --> 17:37.002
Is this question
just to satisfy readers' curiosity?

17:41.534 --> 17:43.293
As a financial reporter

17:43.397 --> 17:45.174
After researching various sources of information

17:45.255 --> 17:46.681
A scholarly review

17:54.513 --> 17:55.652
Xian

17:59.770 --> 18:01.030
This is it

18:04.283 --> 18:05.503
Teacher Kun

18:06.239 --> 18:09.322
Hello, I'm Kung Shuyi, a reporter from Financial Introduction

18:10.372 --> 18:11.592
Do you know me?

18:12.175 --> 18:15.815
In university, I majored in journalism but
minored in finance

18:15.966 --> 18:18.962
During the first class of the finance lesson,
the teacher talked about my uncle

18:19.197 --> 18:22.042
And I work with my uncle every day

18:23.380 --> 18:24.836
On the walls of our office

18:24.917 --> 18:27.718
There is a magazine cover picture of uncle and teacher Shi Wan Kuon

18:27.820 --> 18:30.684
So, my uncle's name
has been with me throughout my university life

18:30.765 --> 18:33.925
My uncle's existence is
a companion in my daily work life

18:34.093 --> 18:38.293
Even though he doesn't appear in public much now,
everyone knows him

18:38.374 --> 18:40.802
Uncle's reputation is
unshakable like Titaung

18:45.090 --> 18:46.590
I just said, what is your name?

18:46.850 --> 18:48.110
Keng Shuyi, right?

18:48.313 --> 18:49.372
Yes

18:49.589 --> 18:51.573
Keng Shuyi

18:54.314 --> 18:56.202
I remember you

18:56.357 --> 18:58.027
I have read three or four of your articles

18:58.155 --> 18:59.156
Not bad writing

18:59.237 --> 19:01.002
It is serious and has a position

19:01.157 --> 19:05.642
Unexpectedly, when I met her in person,
she was a little girl

19:05.837 --> 19:06.957
Too much praise

19:08.643 --> 19:10.784
I think I came to you alone again

19:11.077 --> 19:12.477
I didn't prepare anything

19:12.620 --> 19:14.550
Girl,
don't blame me for that

19:14.803 --> 19:17.982
This guy has never brought any girl here

19:19.230 --> 19:22.245
- Uncle Le Ku, in fact, he is..
- My God..

19:23.169 --> 19:25.522
This place is very beautiful

19:26.037 --> 19:27.868
These horses are also very beautiful

19:32.676 --> 19:36.236
I heard that my
uncle's greatest hobby is horse riding

19:36.317 --> 19:37.866
There will be quite a few horses

19:38.799 --> 19:40.549
This is not my best horse yet

19:40.957 --> 19:43.197
The best horses are inside

19:44.117 --> 19:45.378
Is it still there?

19:45.581 --> 19:46.922
Do you want to see?

19:48.532 --> 19:51.145
Followed the Shiyan girl

19:51.961 --> 19:53.141
come with me

20:02.837 --> 20:03.837
Why?

20:03.917 --> 20:05.522
Is there a problem with Director Xi?

20:05.767 --> 20:08.442
Teacher Kuon invited me

20:17.237 --> 20:18.642
What is there to fear?

20:19.027 --> 20:21.926
Mixing me with horse feed
is not enough to feed the horses

20:33.664 --> 20:35.174
I'll go in and change my shirt

20:37.034 --> 20:38.133
I will wait

20:43.077 --> 20:44.297
Has Shi Xiang entered?

20:48.379 --> 20:50.210
How long have you known Xian?

20:50.593 --> 20:51.932
Not too long ago

20:55.396 --> 20:56.577
It seems so

20:58.674 --> 21:00.002
Can you ride a horse?

21:00.333 --> 21:01.333
I don't know how to ride

21:03.247 --> 21:05.836
Inside were some old riding clothes that my wife wore

21:06.065 --> 21:08.402
If you don't mind, you can wear it

21:08.506 --> 21:11.004
You should try it when it arrives

21:11.468 --> 21:12.567
you do not say

21:16.077 --> 21:17.138
This side

21:40.957 --> 21:43.076
My wife's physique is
not that different from yours

21:43.157 --> 21:44.477
Enough with this

21:45.148 --> 21:46.289
Thank you, Mr. Kun

21:46.555 --> 21:47.775
I will wait for you outside

22:01.737 --> 22:02.876
I can't hear a sound

22:03.460 --> 22:04.839
It's enough to leave

22:59.027 --> 23:00.408
Director Xi

23:03.837 --> 23:06.238
I don't wear this belt

23:06.317 --> 23:07.727
Can you teach me?

24:14.597 --> 24:16.282
(You still want to fool me)

24:21.196 --> 24:22.987
If you can't wear it, don't ride it

24:33.739 --> 24:35.260
Mark said once

24:35.364 --> 24:37.524
If a woman
wants to pursue a man

24:37.605 --> 24:39.169
There is no wall that she cannot overcome

24:39.250 --> 24:40.544
There is no fortress she can break down

24:40.625 --> 24:41.906
There is no worry he can't shake off

24:42.015 --> 24:44.082
Even a god cannot control him

24:44.179 --> 24:46.482
So what am I now facing
an impenetrable fortress?

24:46.586 --> 24:47.707
Dangerous trip?

24:47.788 --> 24:48.988
Wrath of God?

24:49.069 --> 24:50.328
Not one

24:50.415 --> 24:52.270
A small rejection

24:53.695 --> 24:56.522
You can cross over

25:34.340 --> 25:35.780
come come

25:35.877 --> 25:37.333
come come

25:38.917 --> 25:41.587
This horse is the most delicate

25:42.117 --> 25:43.836
After that, ask Shi Xian to teach you

25:43.917 --> 25:45.197
come come

25:46.477 --> 25:47.656
Be careful

25:53.465 --> 25:56.213
A really handsome prince

25:59.317 --> 26:00.947
So the horse

26:04.237 --> 26:06.157
Or a princess?

26:06.237 --> 26:07.482
Really clever

26:07.662 --> 26:10.442
It looks so delicate to me..

26:11.582 --> 26:12.879
We..

26:17.196 --> 26:19.726
So, Director Xi,
please teach me how to ride a horse

26:22.248 --> 26:23.309
Go up

26:33.418 --> 26:35.729
Lead the director

27:08.279 --> 27:10.402
In this way, you will be able to teach horse riding

27:15.468 --> 27:18.042
Relax and learn

27:19.517 --> 27:20.882
Well done

27:21.190 --> 27:24.722
I 'm a little nervous because it's my first time riding a horse

28:08.856 --> 28:09.956
Be sure to sit down

28:10.044 --> 28:11.143
What

28:14.725 --> 28:15.925
Slowly slowly

28:16.037 --> 28:17.663
Slowly

28:43.511 --> 28:45.402
Why don't you?

28:46.334 --> 28:47.694
No, I..

28:47.775 --> 28:49.402
Just get the experience

29:06.957 --> 29:09.947
It is the most delicate horse in the whole horse race

29:10.068 --> 29:11.618
I am also very close to you

29:12.557 --> 29:14.587
Asking you to teach a girl to ride a horse

29:15.206 --> 29:17.355
Why scare him?

29:18.894 --> 29:20.964
He is brave and
doesn't get scared easily

29:22.215 --> 29:23.922
Before, I asked you
to rest on the horse slope

29:24.005 --> 29:25.914
I don't come because I have too much work

29:25.995 --> 29:29.282
Why did you suddenly have time today and
bring the girl?

29:36.073 --> 29:37.482
Suddenly wanted to come

29:37.757 --> 29:39.558
This girl is quite interesting

29:39.677 --> 29:41.467
It's definitely the way you like it

29:43.218 --> 29:44.438
is that so

29:45.261 --> 29:46.762
It's not about anything now

29:46.877 --> 29:50.066
Not now, but if it continues,
something will happen

29:53.037 --> 29:56.586
Did you do such a rough road on purpose?

29:57.486 --> 30:00.242
He even mocked me in front of Mr. Ku

30:00.654 --> 30:02.114
Is it even human?

30:03.237 --> 30:05.036
Mark can't always be right

30:05.124 --> 30:07.762
At least I couldn't even pass the saddle of the horse in front of me

30:08.229 --> 30:09.369
gone

30:13.517 --> 30:14.596
Yes

30:14.677 --> 30:17.268
A lot of things
may be nothing at first

30:17.420 --> 30:20.810
But as it goes on,
there are many possibilities

30:21.020 --> 30:22.400
You're talking

30:23.179 --> 30:24.399
Le Ann technology?

30:26.939 --> 30:28.439
In all cases

30:28.795 --> 30:30.586
Yun Chum is the same

30:32.037 --> 30:34.936
I have heard from Kukyi

30:35.076 --> 30:37.476
I was a little worried about you at first

30:37.557 --> 30:39.562
But now it looks
like I'm too nervous

30:40.441 --> 30:41.620
Xian

30:42.743 --> 30:44.254
The path you want to take

30:44.597 --> 30:46.627
It's long and not easy

30:47.342 --> 30:51.430
Min Yu has just passed a mountain and
decided to establish Yun Chum

30:52.182 --> 30:55.663
Longtian and others
helped Min Yu survive

30:55.789 --> 30:57.229
Now help you too

30:57.310 --> 30:59.929
You must remember this grace

31:00.602 --> 31:03.832
Yun Chum
wants stability more than anything else at this stage

31:04.579 --> 31:06.739
You don't need to make Luang Thanh and other people
angry

31:06.849 --> 31:09.790
If they're not happy, you're going to have a hard time

31:11.969 --> 31:13.070
I remember

31:13.293 --> 31:14.857
So I have to do better

31:14.975 --> 31:18.544
As long as the decisions are right,
all dissatisfaction will be temporary

31:22.749 --> 31:25.521
I also heard about Leyin's case

31:26.892 --> 31:31.651
It's a good choice to invest in them to some extent

31:32.141 --> 31:34.641
As soon as the funds came from Kuon Group

31:35.243 --> 31:37.869
Yun Chum
can invest in both companies

31:38.102 --> 31:39.382
No need to create unnecessary tension

31:39.463 --> 31:41.322
They are all your father's old friends

31:41.420 --> 31:43.771
No need to embarrass them

31:45.572 --> 31:48.211
Uncle,
I understand what Uncle wants to say

31:48.292 --> 31:50.442
But Yun Chum is still very young

31:50.523 --> 31:54.322
I want him to be pure and
good at one thing

31:54.542 --> 31:58.911
We don't want to change our philosophy and purpose to please others

32:00.662 --> 32:03.029
Because of Min Yu's crisis

32:03.110 --> 32:04.470
I understood

32:04.620 --> 32:08.733
A modern company needs more professional and
refined management

32:12.357 --> 32:13.837
Have you come back to avoid it?

32:13.917 --> 32:15.258
What are you doing now?

32:16.180 --> 32:17.540
It has been three or four days since I returned

32:17.723 --> 32:20.201
I'm wasting my life doing nothing

32:21.125 --> 32:24.242
I plan to get him a job to gain experience

32:25.157 --> 32:27.067
You just said it yourself

32:27.388 --> 32:31.469
Sometimes some people may be nothing at first, right?

32:31.550 --> 32:34.385
But as it goes on,
there are many possibilities

32:34.751 --> 32:37.381
Xiao Yue is a smart child

32:37.518 --> 32:40.269
If you train well,
you can become very good

32:41.299 --> 32:42.520
It is possible

32:42.797 --> 32:46.547
I just don't know how to trigger those possibilities

32:47.117 --> 32:50.388
Or ask him to join a group of dicks

32:52.075 --> 32:53.744
To force him to work at the barn?

32:53.964 --> 32:56.164
So
I don't know who should work for whom

32:56.245 --> 32:59.002
Uncle didn't know that
Ku Kyi always wanted him

33:01.693 --> 33:03.122
That's right

33:03.332 --> 33:04.882
If you really want to train him

33:05.014 --> 33:07.964
He has to go to a completely unfamiliar environment

33:08.228 --> 33:11.642
This poor boy can neither study nor
play sports

33:11.774 --> 33:13.484
What company would want him?

33:13.796 --> 33:16.835
Did Ekanta hire him as a bribe?

33:16.923 --> 33:18.594
Don't tell the child that

33:18.774 --> 33:21.421
Xiao Yue is smart, happy, and
emotionally mature

33:21.502 --> 33:23.412
I like to talk to people

33:24.326 --> 33:27.362
Ask him to be a reporter

33:27.869 --> 33:29.638
Did he study journalism abroad?

33:29.719 --> 33:31.202
Major and work bite

33:33.300 --> 33:34.560
Reporter

33:34.797 --> 33:36.178
A man like him?

33:36.277 --> 33:40.348
So what kind of person do you think a journalist
should be?

34:01.406 --> 34:04.522
Xin
can win the best actor Oscar in China

34:04.715 --> 34:06.306
This is the form

34:06.570 --> 34:09.241
It was as if he had just done such an act

34:16.757 --> 34:19.378
I think I might have to give it a try

34:19.732 --> 34:21.072
I had to try it

34:21.310 --> 34:24.168
I have a journalist friend
who can help

34:26.197 --> 34:28.147
Do you also know the reporters of U Le Koon ?

34:29.579 --> 34:31.362
The reporters know me

34:34.479 --> 34:36.360
Still watching

34:36.597 --> 34:38.802
You want to see my shame

34:39.145 --> 34:40.486
Let's see

34:40.829 --> 34:42.109
You don't have much chance anymore

34:42.196 --> 34:44.122
Don't think about seeing me again

34:53.045 --> 34:54.202
Chan Shanro

34:54.637 --> 34:55.642
Director Xi

34:55.733 --> 34:58.793
Secretary Chan
said there was an important matter at the company

35:01.236 --> 35:02.517
Send the reporter back first

35:02.628 --> 35:03.767
all right

35:11.710 --> 35:13.842
(Isn't this man hungry?)

35:14.313 --> 35:17.584
(Interviewing for two hours
, riding a horse for an entire evening)

35:17.725 --> 35:19.766
(If you forget to eat it on its own, keep it)

35:19.877 --> 35:22.577
(How do you not know a little about society?)

35:23.099 --> 35:25.969
(He doesn't want to throw me a meal, so
I'll buy it for him.)

35:34.117 --> 35:36.837
(but the way he works)

35:36.918 --> 35:39.002
(quite attractive)

36:56.020 --> 36:58.122
I'm sorry, Director Shiro

36:58.469 --> 37:00.402
I have to go because there is a matter with Director Xi

37:03.197 --> 37:04.878
Long Phang,
I will go first

37:04.988 --> 37:06.247
You send him home

37:09.597 --> 37:11.919
When he wakes up, see what else he needs

37:12.513 --> 37:14.042
Send it home

37:14.234 --> 37:15.415
Well done, Director Xi

37:19.075 --> 37:20.536
I don't need it anymore, thanks

37:22.877 --> 37:25.417
(What a strange friendship)

37:25.837 --> 37:28.273
(When I think about it,
I don't get impatient)

37:28.580 --> 37:31.603
(He gave me a car and ran away.
How big is that?)

37:40.925 --> 37:43.965
How did you fall asleep in the interviewer's car?

37:44.179 --> 37:46.602
The interviewer is Shi Xian

37:46.981 --> 37:49.282
It never happened before

37:49.420 --> 37:51.249
Very unprofessional

37:52.219 --> 37:53.540
I fell asleep so soundly

37:53.660 --> 37:55.772
I don't know if I have done something shameful yet

38:04.477 --> 38:05.557
On the threshold

38:05.620 --> 38:07.522
The earring is only 25 yuan per side

38:07.606 --> 38:10.317
Leave it as a gift for teaching me

38:19.677 --> 38:20.717
Director Xi

38:20.779 --> 38:23.912
Thank you very much for coming to see me this time

38:23.993 --> 38:25.092
sit down

38:26.533 --> 38:27.652
But

38:27.823 --> 38:30.362
Some things I really can't control

38:30.557 --> 38:32.722
Anyway,
I'm not the only one

38:33.227 --> 38:35.287
I can't just think about my dreams

38:35.963 --> 38:37.102
I understand

38:37.357 --> 38:39.962
Yun Chum can give you what Lei Ying can give you

38:40.173 --> 38:41.294
You should also understand

38:41.445 --> 38:44.005
Yun Chum
only because of his sincerity towards Le Ann

38:44.109 --> 38:46.789
Le Yin offered Le An a fifty million purchase price

38:46.885 --> 38:49.042
I understand, but

38:49.221 --> 38:53.222
Fifty million
is quite attractive to Le Ann at the moment

38:54.613 --> 38:58.393
Director Chen, you also know that Leying
still needs investment from us

38:58.550 --> 39:02.300
Not to mention they
don't have enough funds for this purchase

39:02.446 --> 39:03.565
If you look at the long term

39:03.676 --> 39:07.242
Your team
should not be at the helm of a combined company at this stage

39:07.359 --> 39:09.919
Yun Chum
wants to establish China Chip with Le An

39:10.015 --> 39:12.269
So what is the best fit for Le Ann at this stage?

39:12.350 --> 39:14.562
Certainly financial support is
not for sale

39:14.983 --> 39:17.722
Director Xi,
you know our value

39:18.496 --> 39:21.342
But we have been discussing with Yun Chum for some time now

39:21.441 --> 39:23.197
There was no progress in our cooperation

39:23.259 --> 39:26.082
Now our team
is in urgent need of funding for the breakthrough

39:26.265 --> 39:28.446
My team has no answer

39:30.803 --> 39:33.782
Give me some time and
I will quickly work out the details of the collaboration

39:33.924 --> 39:35.753
Solve these problems together

40:04.357 --> 40:06.397
(The legs are already black from the horse's saddle )

40:06.570 --> 40:09.343
(
I'm tired to death because of an article)

40:09.737 --> 40:11.328
(it's really not easy)

40:19.321 --> 40:21.741
(When I go, I will have a massage)

40:22.844 --> 40:25.434
(I'm not going to finish the article)

41:43.557 --> 41:45.750
Not a bad article, I'm tired

41:46.453 --> 41:48.402
I'm not tired,
it's very good to write

41:50.060 --> 41:52.058
Why is there more to say?

41:53.580 --> 41:56.889
Sister, I have a few ideas

41:57.179 --> 42:00.258
In this interview, Xian
shared many innovative views

42:00.339 --> 42:02.530
It will appeal to most young readers

42:02.757 --> 42:06.637
But he is always secretive, so
many people want to know about him

42:06.826 --> 42:10.908
So, I want to add the audio file of Shi Xian to the digital magazine

42:13.500 --> 42:16.339
Shuyi's idea is good

42:16.419 --> 42:19.671
But upgrading a digital magazine is not an easy task

42:19.987 --> 42:21.522
It needs a lot of manpower and money

42:21.603 --> 42:24.591
Who will release the audio file you just mentioned ?

42:25.527 --> 42:27.087
I understand, sister

42:27.260 --> 42:30.512
So we
have to catch up with the reading habits of our readers

42:30.628 --> 42:31.787
You should take the lead

42:31.899 --> 42:34.202
That will increase sales and
upgrade the magazine

42:34.283 --> 42:36.859
Once the magazine has been upgraded and
given a more diverse presentation style

42:36.940 --> 42:39.179
It can improve the reading experience of readers

42:39.267 --> 42:40.800
Can give an effective response

42:40.892 --> 42:43.292
That's why they want to pay for our content

42:43.413 --> 42:47.162
Once we get the funding , we can upgrade and redesign the magazine

42:47.580 --> 42:49.580
To produce the audio file

42:49.660 --> 42:51.562
I learned the basics online

42:51.819 --> 42:53.450
I can do it now

42:54.260 --> 42:56.404
You are really persistent

42:57.037 --> 42:59.106
I will speak to the editor-in-chief first

42:59.197 --> 43:00.958
I will try to help you do this one

43:01.744 --> 43:02.842
Thank you sister
