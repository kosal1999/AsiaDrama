01:31.002 --> 01:36.057
(Just For Love)

01:36.082 --> 01:39.082
(Episode 7)

01:42.282 --> 01:46.322
(Storage room)

01:54.301 --> 01:56.004
It's too late now.

01:56.093 --> 01:58.005
So why not approved?

01:58.103 --> 01:59.846
What are we waiting for here?

02:00.003 --> 02:01.003
What can we do?

02:01.028 --> 02:03.409
We work in the
news industry. We have to be careful.

02:03.594 --> 02:05.184
We agreed to wait until
12 midnight, so just wait,

02:05.209 --> 02:06.682
not even a minute less.

02:08.504 --> 02:10.212
The author is waiting,

02:10.237 --> 02:11.819
so why are you complaining?

02:16.184 --> 02:17.917
How? Did he reply?

02:20.294 --> 02:22.194
He said he would reply today.

02:22.295 --> 02:23.520
I trust him.

02:31.695 --> 02:33.733
Mr. Shi, at this time,

02:33.807 --> 02:36.906
everyone at our magazine
is gathered and waiting for your answer.

02:37.205 --> 02:39.330
It's not just
about you or me.

02:39.416 --> 02:42.626
The publication of a magazine issue
involves the hard work of many people.

02:42.788 --> 02:45.162
The workers at the printing factory
are still waiting.

02:45.187 --> 02:47.801
If you don't want to
approve the manuscript, that's fine,

02:47.826 --> 02:49.387
but please give
a clear answer.

02:49.412 --> 02:51.524
Other colleagues' articles
may replace it.

02:52.194 --> 02:53.690
If I receive your reply,

02:53.715 --> 02:55.938
I will visit to thank
you.

02:56.295 --> 02:59.219
Once again, I beg you
to reply as soon as possible.

03:26.042 --> 03:28.242
(Manuscript approved!)

03:32.007 --> 03:33.615
Everyone, excited.

03:35.894 --> 03:38.282
The manuscript of the interview
with Shi Yan has been approved.

03:45.190 --> 03:46.797
You have all worked hard.

03:46.822 --> 03:47.995
Hang on a little longer...

03:48.020 --> 03:49.490
and complete
the remaining tasks.

03:49.515 --> 03:51.215
Yes! Congratulations, Shu Yi!

03:51.493 --> 03:53.818
- Congratulations, Shu Yi!
- Congratulations, Shu Yi! Treat you!

03:58.282 --> 04:01.322
(Introduction to Finance)

04:03.292 --> 04:05.228
- I'll be back first.
- Goodbye.

04:09.507 --> 04:10.988
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.497
Thank you for your hard work.

04:14.895 --> 04:17.170
Are equally. Anyway,
my boss also works late.

04:17.195 --> 04:18.704
He works
harder than me.

04:23.312 --> 04:24.596
Thank you, Mr. Shi.

04:24.627 --> 04:26.328
You have worked hard, Mr. Shi.

04:38.093 --> 04:40.275
There was also an unsubscribe yesterday.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.202
Why no response today?

04:45.197 --> 04:48.529
Does he like corny compliments?

05:05.106 --> 05:07.795
Have you ever heard of
"men are forever young"?

05:07.820 --> 05:09.970
When they are not honest
with themselves,

05:09.995 --> 05:11.617
women will have no chance.

05:11.886 --> 05:13.962
Have you never read a novel
about an arrogant CEO?

05:14.202 --> 05:16.895
The more the man likes you,
the more he doesn't want to admit it.

05:16.920 --> 05:18.802
The more he likes you,
the more he wants to bully you.

05:19.002 --> 05:20.922
Shi Yan is that kind of man.

05:38.295 --> 05:39.515
Rainy day with Wen,

05:39.540 --> 05:40.866
stormy day with Yan Zi,

05:40.897 --> 05:42.370
sunny day with Jie,

05:42.395 --> 05:44.116
nothing compares to
chatting with you.

05:44.484 --> 05:46.915
Today, as usual,
I want to catch up with you.

05:47.295 --> 05:48.988
Even if you ignore me today,

05:49.013 --> 05:50.714
I will still message you tomorrow.

05:51.194 --> 05:53.471
If you think
my approach is a bit cliche, I'm sorry,

05:53.496 --> 05:54.824
but I did it on purpose.

06:20.301 --> 06:22.024
Let's meet
at the usual place tonight.

06:24.107 --> 06:26.426
I have plans tonight.
Next time, maybe.

06:33.214 --> 06:34.717
He still hasn't arrived yet?

06:34.890 --> 06:37.477
This Yi situation is the same as
when I was in college,

06:37.502 --> 06:39.100
always slow at everything.

06:39.603 --> 06:41.433
It's been over 30 minutes.

06:41.799 --> 06:44.573
She is a
famous beauty influencer now.

06:44.598 --> 06:46.318
That's how arrogant he is.

06:47.897 --> 06:50.427
Lately, the world of new media
has been really busy, hasn't it?

06:50.991 --> 06:52.287
But that makes sense.

06:52.312 --> 06:53.894
That makes a lot of money.

06:54.089 --> 06:56.717
No wonder you're thinking
about digital publishing.

06:59.389 --> 07:01.488
Sorry im late.
I have to upload a vlog today.

07:01.513 --> 07:02.880
I just finished editing.

07:02.905 --> 07:05.012
Order whatever
you like, I pay.

07:05.803 --> 07:08.286
You made us wait a long time.
So, of course you pay.

07:08.785 --> 07:09.985
Order it.

07:10.391 --> 07:11.964
Long time no see, Situ Yi.

07:11.989 --> 07:13.125
You have changed a lot.

07:13.150 --> 07:14.369
You become more beautiful.

07:14.394 --> 07:15.888
You are still beautiful
as always,

07:15.913 --> 07:17.419
not much different from before.

07:17.587 --> 07:20.128
Oh, yes. are you still working
at Financial Introduction?

07:20.300 --> 07:22.995
It's been three years
since we graduated.

07:23.207 --> 07:26.007
You must be a deputy author
or author now.

07:26.494 --> 07:28.257
Not. I am still in my old position,

07:28.282 --> 07:29.911
working as a special features reporter.

07:30.595 --> 07:32.677
With
print media struggling,

07:32.702 --> 07:34.268
I'm surprised you
still haven't changed jobs.

07:34.293 --> 07:36.609
I remind you that you have been promoted
to the management level,

07:36.634 --> 07:38.242
That's why you refuse to go.

07:38.607 --> 07:39.892
Let me give you some advice,

07:39.917 --> 07:42.323
it's time to shift
focus to new media.

07:43.199 --> 07:44.399
It's fine.

07:44.693 --> 07:46.375
We're actually
working on a digital version.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.375
I am also thinking of
ways to change and upgrade…

07:48.400 --> 07:49.873
to make it more interesting
for readers.

07:49.898 --> 07:52.381
Certain formats or media
may become obsolete,

07:52.406 --> 07:53.984
but good content
always lasts.

07:54.016 --> 07:55.487
Just like your vlog,

07:55.512 --> 07:56.980
video as a medium...

07:57.011 --> 07:59.417
eventually it will probably be
replaced by new media,

07:59.597 --> 08:01.399
but as long as
your content remains good…

08:01.424 --> 08:03.827
and stay up-to-date,
it will never become obsolete.

08:04.013 --> 08:05.242
Nice speech.

08:07.895 --> 08:12.031
These are the technical issues and challenges
we are currently facing,

08:12.105 --> 08:15.842
along with some of
our thoughts on how to deal with it.

08:16.393 --> 08:19.075
So, we hope you
can give us some…

08:19.100 --> 08:21.233
technical support and guidance.

08:22.080 --> 08:24.110
You did well,

08:24.892 --> 08:27.316
but I suggest
to reevaluate…

08:27.341 --> 08:29.502
the time required to
solve this problem,

08:30.114 --> 08:33.471
set up a special task force
to deal with this problem,

08:33.496 --> 08:35.383
while
other technical departments continue…

08:35.408 --> 08:37.122
their explorations in other parts.

08:37.702 --> 08:40.562
I really want to give some
insights during this process,

08:41.184 --> 08:44.126
but I still can't
join Le'an Technology.

08:44.419 --> 08:46.482
Your current team structure…

08:47.311 --> 08:51.409
doesn't quite match
my expectations for technical development.

08:53.514 --> 08:55.223
I apologize for interrupting,

08:57.607 --> 08:59.277
but I still hope
you will consider…

08:59.302 --> 09:01.706
to join Le'an Technology,
Professor Bruce.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.724
Yu You told me that
you like a challenge,

09:04.984 --> 09:07.111
but based on
what you said earlier,

09:07.493 --> 09:10.474
achieving success in
this technology is only a matter of time.

09:10.499 --> 09:12.082
Openly,

09:12.107 --> 09:13.484
given enough time,

09:13.522 --> 09:15.821
other teams will succeed
sooner or later.

09:16.001 --> 09:17.308
Therefore, I believe…

09:17.333 --> 09:20.425
this matter cannot be referred to
as a mere challenge.

09:20.893 --> 09:24.605
However, for Le'an Technology,
all this is very difficult,

09:24.704 --> 09:27.518
maybe even, as
you say, "impossible."

09:27.794 --> 09:30.987
So, building a
new team in China…

09:31.012 --> 09:32.988
and achieving technological breakthroughs…

09:33.013 --> 09:34.642
in an impossible period of time,

09:34.894 --> 09:37.029
that's the real challenge.

09:37.406 --> 09:39.075
As soon as we
can overcome this difficulty,

09:39.100 --> 09:40.642
we need to implement and…

09:40.667 --> 09:42.098
Use this technology
immediately...

09:42.129 --> 09:43.760
into
mass production and consumption.

09:43.785 --> 09:45.082
This series of challenges…

09:45.107 --> 09:47.608
not something
one person can do…

09:47.633 --> 09:49.202
or a team easily.

09:50.906 --> 09:53.723
Personally, I find this
full of fun and challenges.

09:53.803 --> 09:56.185
This is an experience
you won't find…

09:56.210 --> 09:58.809
in overseas laboratories and academies.

10:01.713 --> 10:05.642
But I can't
do all this alone.

10:06.610 --> 10:09.017
I will provide financial support,

10:09.110 --> 10:12.300
and I will help Chen Kang
build a leading team…

10:12.325 --> 10:14.435
not just national, even global.

10:14.586 --> 10:18.402
Next, it's up to you
to accept the challenge.

10:23.186 --> 10:25.403
Lord Shi, what did
you say today…

10:25.428 --> 10:26.985
really exciting,

10:27.200 --> 10:29.502
but this is not an easy decision.

10:29.595 --> 10:31.428
I need some
time to think about it.

10:32.799 --> 10:33.920
Bruce,

10:33.997 --> 10:36.042
Shi Yan is an exceptional business partner .

10:36.200 --> 10:37.682
Challenging with him…

10:37.707 --> 10:39.629
will get different pleasures.

10:39.913 --> 10:41.113
In addition,

10:41.806 --> 10:43.169
he is a great rock climber.

10:43.194 --> 10:44.910
You can try
to beat him.

10:46.713 --> 10:48.720
This is truly an important decision.

10:49.106 --> 10:50.717
I will give you
time to think.

10:50.886 --> 10:52.530
But I want to say that,

10:52.593 --> 10:54.722
whatever your decision,

10:54.807 --> 10:56.917
I will not give up
on my goal.

10:58.894 --> 11:00.294
Shu Yi,

11:00.319 --> 11:02.522
You're not still with
Yue Xing Zhou, are you?

11:03.706 --> 11:04.923
We have broken up.

11:05.310 --> 11:06.689
Are you two really broken up?

11:06.714 --> 11:08.674
It's in the class group chat.

11:08.699 --> 11:10.325
Why are you so surprised?

11:11.013 --> 11:12.679
Because you two have broken up,

11:12.704 --> 11:14.228
I want to tell you something.

11:14.607 --> 11:15.712
What is he?

11:15.993 --> 11:17.382
While in college,

11:17.407 --> 11:19.690
didn't Yue Xing Zhou
chase you for a long time?

11:19.715 --> 11:21.088
Actually,

11:21.113 --> 11:23.423
he also seduced me
at the same time.

11:23.694 --> 11:25.329
You may not know about that.

11:26.006 --> 11:27.326
what did you say

11:27.400 --> 11:29.377
We just attract each other.

11:29.402 --> 11:31.562
Frankly,
I was only his second choice.

11:31.794 --> 11:33.495
Every time he can't
ask you out,

11:33.520 --> 11:35.190
I am his friend.

11:35.296 --> 11:38.816
I was naive then. I think
he is handsome and loving.

11:38.990 --> 11:40.575
I think I can
win her heart,

11:40.600 --> 11:42.211
and change our relationship
into something more serious.

11:42.236 --> 11:43.370
Useless man.

11:43.402 --> 11:45.105
It's fine. That's all in the past.

11:48.698 --> 11:51.178
Situ Yi didn't say
anything at that time,

11:51.203 --> 11:52.796
but now he wants to
tell you everything.

11:52.821 --> 11:54.622
He is really useless.

11:55.302 --> 11:57.562
But the most
useless is Yue Xing Zhou.

11:57.693 --> 11:59.523
Actually, Situ Yi was right.

11:59.893 --> 12:01.065
About what?

12:01.507 --> 12:02.984
My plans for
a digital magazine upgrade…

12:03.009 --> 12:03.989
can't be delayed anymore.

12:04.014 --> 12:05.586
We have to do it
as soon as possible.

12:05.819 --> 12:07.194
I am talking about Yue Xing Zhou,

12:07.219 --> 12:09.019
and you are talking
about digital magazines?

12:09.112 --> 12:12.910
Can you have the love, hate
and desire of an ordinary woman?

12:13.712 --> 12:16.409
How can you win Shi Yan's heart
if you don't know how you feel?

12:16.434 --> 12:17.613
If you can't win her heart,

12:17.638 --> 12:19.499
Will your digital magazine plan
be successful?

12:19.612 --> 12:23.214
So, pay more attention
to Shi Yan, okay?

12:23.992 --> 12:25.489
I will venture
into digital magazines,

12:25.514 --> 12:27.183
and I will
win Shi Yan's heart too.

12:27.294 --> 12:29.217
Good. Good luck then.

12:31.893 --> 12:34.526
Well, I'll see you
in half an hour.

12:36.812 --> 12:38.282
Fan, I will not go back to the office.

12:38.307 --> 12:39.631
Take me to Jingxiao Tower.

12:39.799 --> 12:41.000
OK, Mr. Shi.

12:47.105 --> 12:48.297
Come get me.

12:48.322 --> 12:49.722
I miss you.

13:05.004 --> 13:07.395
Oh my god, are you crazy?

13:07.420 --> 13:09.196
You still tease him
so boldly.

13:09.221 --> 13:11.911
This is not a big deal.
He won't even read it.

13:51.094 --> 13:52.522
How do you…

13:52.998 --> 13:54.398
I happened to be there.

13:55.695 --> 13:56.895
So coincidental.

13:57.194 --> 13:58.394
If not?

14:00.292 --> 14:01.639
That's right too.

14:07.992 --> 14:10.520
Where is Mr. Chen? Why is he not there?

14:11.162 --> 14:12.642
Is he busy?

14:18.200 --> 14:20.489
With the year-end press conference…

14:20.514 --> 14:22.080
and collaboration with
Guan Capital,

14:22.105 --> 14:23.493
you all must be busy.

14:23.518 --> 14:24.920
What do you want to find him?

14:26.287 --> 14:29.068
No, I'm just wondering
how things are going.

14:29.093 --> 14:30.827
I can
just send him a message.

14:44.706 --> 14:46.684
Please drop me off
at the front, thank you.

14:46.709 --> 14:47.912
Good.

14:58.939 --> 15:00.432
Why did you get out of the car?

15:01.994 --> 15:04.113
I saw you go down,
so I went down too.

15:05.785 --> 15:08.530
I came down because I want to
give you two space.

15:08.607 --> 15:12.026
Him sending you back is a
good opportunity to bond.

15:13.399 --> 15:15.823
You also saw his sour face.

15:16.506 --> 15:18.266
I don't even know
what I said wrong.

15:18.291 --> 15:20.002
He sulked suddenly.

15:20.494 --> 15:23.405
You called Shi Yan, but you were
busy asking about other men.

15:23.430 --> 15:25.111
Anyone would be disappointed.

15:25.200 --> 15:26.762
He must be jealous.

15:27.390 --> 15:31.310
Your moves are like
textbook examples of awkward flirting.

15:31.383 --> 15:33.682
Zheng Shu Yi, whatever,
you are a journalist.

15:33.899 --> 15:37.121
You must know some language arts.

15:37.187 --> 15:39.457
Even if this is how you
can win Shi Yan's heart,

15:39.482 --> 15:41.882
I'm retiring from
the dating game.

15:43.194 --> 15:44.425
Jealous?

15:45.786 --> 15:48.031
Shi Yan was jealous of Chen Sheng?

15:48.399 --> 15:49.915
It's not possible.

15:50.697 --> 15:51.897
Tuan Shi.

15:52.396 --> 15:53.596
What is he?

15:54.400 --> 15:57.517
I was wondering if you
wanted me to make you dinner.

15:57.999 --> 16:00.122
No need. Aren't
you supposed to be busy?

16:07.394 --> 16:10.682
I should be busy?

16:11.693 --> 16:13.322
What does it mean?

16:15.791 --> 16:18.300
Thank you for giving
us a ride today, Mr. Shi.

16:19.407 --> 16:22.002
I will go shopping later
as a thank you.

16:29.698 --> 16:33.083
Lord Shi,
what kind of destiny do you think…

16:33.114 --> 16:35.317
take us there with you today?

16:41.888 --> 16:44.414
He must have a strange sense of humor.

16:44.593 --> 16:46.605
He never
replies to serious messages.

16:52.612 --> 16:55.820
Mr. Shi, were you jealous earlier?

17:07.194 --> 17:08.618
You have a lot of free time.

17:09.590 --> 17:10.831
I have a lot of free time.

17:10.990 --> 17:12.190
What does this mean?

17:14.394 --> 17:16.840
Because you don't understand,
don't reply to the message.

17:17.294 --> 17:18.913
Leave the message
for a few days.

17:23.485 --> 17:25.315
Let's meet
at the usual place tonight.

17:27.604 --> 17:29.725
I have a few things.
I have to go.

17:31.185 --> 17:33.295
I told you not to
reply to his messages, didn't I?

17:33.320 --> 17:35.448
Leave her messages
for a few days.

17:36.398 --> 17:37.598
Why?

17:47.903 --> 17:49.065
This is good.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.503
This code mix
is ​​absolutely brilliant.

17:51.597 --> 17:54.614
Don't explain it to him.
Let him guess what it means.

17:54.800 --> 17:58.707
I guarantee tonight
he'll be pacing,

17:58.739 --> 18:00.810
try to find out if that
is some kind of secret love code.

18:00.896 --> 18:02.080
Really?

18:02.105 --> 18:04.440
That's right. Do not reply to his messages.

18:05.885 --> 18:08.189
The first step to
keeping a guy interested…

18:08.214 --> 18:10.062
is to make him
wonder about you,

18:10.087 --> 18:11.597
let him guess,

18:11.622 --> 18:13.310
and piqued his interest.

18:15.004 --> 18:16.625
So, don't reply to his messages.

19:11.512 --> 19:13.465
If Shi Yan knew
I brought you here,

19:13.490 --> 19:14.725
he will strangle me.

19:14.892 --> 19:16.760
Why are you nagging so much?

19:17.105 --> 19:18.724
I am already 22 years old.

19:18.793 --> 19:20.917
I have passed the
legal age to go to the club.

19:21.085 --> 19:23.518
After all, I've been to
places like this abroad.

19:25.391 --> 19:27.523
Drink quickly. After this,
I will take you home.

19:37.586 --> 19:38.898
What does this mean?

19:39.894 --> 19:41.821
Long live him.

19:55.096 --> 19:57.326
What do you mean by this?

19:59.592 --> 20:00.723
I do not know.

20:00.988 --> 20:02.420
Maybe he sent it by mistake.

20:06.506 --> 20:09.240
This uncle is really
strange lately.

20:10.800 --> 20:12.306
He's never been normal since before.

20:14.488 --> 20:18.207
Well, you dare
to say that about auntie.

20:18.312 --> 20:19.497
I will tell him now.

20:20.414 --> 20:21.614
In a moment…

20:26.287 --> 20:27.704
Just kidding.

20:31.302 --> 20:33.695
So you're afraid of him too?

20:47.994 --> 20:49.160
Let's drink.

21:43.293 --> 21:44.327
Yes, she is beautiful.

21:44.704 --> 21:45.907
Early one?

21:48.596 --> 21:50.399
It's not fun to drink alone.

21:50.484 --> 21:52.619
How about I
drink with you?

21:53.892 --> 21:55.224
No need, thank you.

21:56.386 --> 21:57.721
If you don't want today,

21:57.908 --> 21:59.297
maybe next time.

21:59.397 --> 22:02.227
Let's exchange numbers
and we'll go out later.

22:02.805 --> 22:04.160
It's not necessary.

22:05.389 --> 22:06.673
Don't be shy.

22:06.698 --> 22:08.632
What's wrong with leaving your number?

22:10.892 --> 22:11.892
Fast.

22:12.492 --> 22:13.719
I will scan your code.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.814
No, thank you. My boyfriend
will be here in a moment.

22:18.902 --> 22:21.625
Talking like that just
spoils the fun, doesn't it?

22:24.694 --> 22:25.927
Where are you going?

22:26.693 --> 22:27.810
What happen?

22:31.606 --> 22:34.031
13318900476.

22:34.986 --> 22:37.025
You want a number, right?
Write it down quickly.

22:38.898 --> 22:42.008
My sister is young
and a bit shy.

22:42.195 --> 22:44.015
I'll give you my number.

22:44.186 --> 22:45.714
You can message me later.

22:45.886 --> 22:47.086
You can too.

22:53.999 --> 22:56.300
Miss, thank you
for helping me.

22:56.402 --> 22:58.006
But you gave him your number.

22:58.031 --> 22:59.520
What if he bothers you?

23:03.160 --> 23:04.960
(Police Contact Card)

23:06.589 --> 23:08.010
You are so clever.

23:08.494 --> 23:10.673
It's also good when girls
go out and have fun,

23:10.698 --> 23:13.569
but you have to learn to
judge people well…

23:13.594 --> 23:14.994
and protect yourself.

23:15.999 --> 23:17.431
I've learned that trick.

23:20.592 --> 23:22.627
I think you're
really weird now.

23:22.714 --> 23:24.609
Is something
wrong with you?

23:24.790 --> 23:27.106
I could drink
a lot more today.

23:28.193 --> 23:29.403
Where are you?

23:30.808 --> 23:32.809
- Let's go drink again.
- I'm busy with something.

23:32.833 --> 23:34.600
- I have to go.
- Let's drink!

23:53.798 --> 23:55.072
In that case,

23:55.097 --> 23:57.228
you have to thank him
and drink with him.

23:58.304 --> 24:02.334
He has a complete package,
interior and exterior.

24:03.294 --> 24:04.422
Where is he sitting?

24:08.190 --> 24:09.365
Looks like he wants to go.

24:09.390 --> 24:10.671
It feels like another time.

24:10.696 --> 24:12.520
Luckily I
added him on WeChat.

24:15.593 --> 24:16.917
I'll be back soon.

24:17.796 --> 24:19.516
But you just came back.

24:22.094 --> 24:23.840
Why with him?

24:29.093 --> 24:30.808
Why didn't you
tell me you were coming?

24:33.193 --> 24:34.725
I saw you with your friend.

24:35.493 --> 24:36.867
What do you say when we drink together?

24:36.892 --> 24:38.111
Yue really likes you.

24:38.697 --> 24:40.840
I didn't think you were
so attractive to girls.

24:42.696 --> 24:45.240
You're more attractive
to girls, aren't you?

24:47.892 --> 24:49.305
He is quite cute.

24:50.293 --> 24:51.831
I like him too.

24:52.692 --> 24:54.923
Yue is still young. He didn't know
how to deal with such a situation.

24:55.299 --> 24:56.623
Thank you for your help.

25:01.692 --> 25:02.930
I am quite tired.

25:03.197 --> 25:04.717
Let's drink another time.

25:05.297 --> 25:06.525
Let me send you home.

25:08.286 --> 25:09.486
Ruo Shan.

25:11.693 --> 25:13.512
My friend has arrived.
Goodbye.

25:28.702 --> 25:29.900
Where do you want to go?

25:30.986 --> 25:33.018
Just drop me off at the front.

25:35.593 --> 25:36.888
I know a good place.

25:36.913 --> 25:39.410
- We can go for a drink, or…
- I'm a bit tired today.

26:25.297 --> 26:28.106
Shi Yan, we have
read your interview.

26:28.198 --> 26:29.423
Well done.

26:29.694 --> 26:31.368
Some of our old friends
have also read it.

26:31.393 --> 26:33.342
They all say
you are still young and talented.

26:33.600 --> 26:34.999
Thank you, Aunt Tian.

26:36.004 --> 26:38.428
We have also read
Chen Kang's interview.

26:38.707 --> 26:41.226
- That young man is also rather good.
- Agree.

26:41.493 --> 26:43.366
When we had dinner
with your father last night,

26:43.391 --> 26:45.491
we talked about
Le'an's development.

26:45.516 --> 26:47.400
They all praise
your wise views,

26:47.425 --> 26:49.195
say you have
made great progress.

26:49.220 --> 26:52.298
So, this time, we will
support you too.

26:52.511 --> 26:56.591
We believe Le'an
has the potential to develop further.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.676
After obtaining Le'an,

26:58.701 --> 27:00.960
we will do our best
to help make money.

27:01.501 --> 27:03.111
Due to Guan Capital
join us,

27:03.142 --> 27:05.712
Yunchuang's funds will be
more than enough,

27:06.693 --> 27:09.411
and we can consider
to cooperate with Lieying.

27:10.006 --> 27:12.497
We can balance
both gains…

27:12.809 --> 27:14.485
- and personal relationships.
- That's right.

27:19.099 --> 27:21.499
Thank you for the support of
Uncle Tian and Uncle Zhang.

27:21.524 --> 27:24.728
I have made a
long term plan for Le'an.

27:25.106 --> 27:26.643
Le'an's future
involves paving the way…

27:26.668 --> 27:28.250
for China's semiconductor industry.

27:28.275 --> 27:29.903
When we have
a technological advantage,

27:29.928 --> 27:32.002
I'm not worried about
making money.

27:32.609 --> 27:36.080
As for Lieying, I never
doubted the profit.

27:36.794 --> 27:38.809
It's just that Yunchuang
prefers to focus on...

27:39.293 --> 27:41.585
helping young people
with entrepreneurial ideas…

27:41.610 --> 27:43.186
who are eager
to make a change.

27:43.211 --> 27:45.098
I hope to be able to support
and accompany them…

27:45.123 --> 27:47.272
in their entrepreneurial journey
with funding and time.

27:47.297 --> 27:49.961
For an
established company like Lieying,

27:51.487 --> 27:52.916
Yunchuang will not be involved.

27:58.203 --> 27:59.403
Okay.

28:01.099 --> 28:03.806
Since you
are the CEO of Yunchuang,

28:04.002 --> 28:05.410
you decide…

28:06.499 --> 28:07.714
in this matter.

28:08.294 --> 28:09.720
Goodbye, sir.

28:21.193 --> 28:24.213
It feels good to be
back on the university campus.

28:24.699 --> 28:26.577
You should come back often
when you have time.

28:26.602 --> 28:28.534
And attend
your lecture too, Professor Yu?

28:29.793 --> 28:31.116
Just call me Yu You.

28:32.100 --> 28:33.495
When I was in college,

28:33.520 --> 28:36.023
we don't have a young
and handsome professor like you.

28:36.493 --> 28:39.111
Calling you "professor"
makes you look old.

28:39.691 --> 28:41.188
If I don't meet
you in person,

28:41.213 --> 28:43.387
I remember that interview that
wrote about Zhu Xing Guo...

28:43.412 --> 28:44.984
and interviewing Shi Yan…

28:45.009 --> 28:47.029
is an experienced senior journalist .

28:51.105 --> 28:53.114
I wondered.

28:53.714 --> 28:54.994
Although China is great,

28:55.019 --> 28:56.708
but there is a lot of freedom
outside the country too.

28:56.733 --> 28:58.512
Why did you choose
to return to China?

28:58.913 --> 29:00.413
Because China needs me.

29:00.514 --> 29:02.918
Furthermore, I have many
like-minded friends here.

29:03.900 --> 29:06.426
Are you talking about
Mr. Guan from Guan Capital?

29:06.499 --> 29:08.440
Not only him, Shi Yan too.

29:09.920 --> 29:11.360
(mother)

29:12.302 --> 29:13.923
Sorry, I have to take a call.

29:16.085 --> 29:18.009
Yi, what are you doing now?

29:18.034 --> 29:19.104
Mom, I'm busy.

29:19.129 --> 29:21.374
Why are you
so busy lately?

29:21.399 --> 29:23.268
You need to make
time to get out…

29:23.293 --> 29:25.517
and manage your personal affairs.

29:25.604 --> 29:27.562
When it comes to
love and marriage,

29:27.587 --> 29:28.907
you have to take the initiative.

29:28.932 --> 29:32.020
- You can't wait.
- I know.

29:32.096 --> 29:33.588
Do not worry.
If you find the right man,

29:33.613 --> 29:35.320
I will definitely take the initiative.

29:35.784 --> 29:37.698
I really have to go
now, I'm at work.

29:37.723 --> 29:38.811
Goodbye.

29:41.692 --> 29:43.412
Is your family rushing
you to get married?

29:45.626 --> 29:46.682
I can understand.

29:46.707 --> 29:48.018
My mother is the same.

29:49.692 --> 29:53.289
Why do I suddenly feel like
we should have met sooner?

29:53.408 --> 29:55.325
We may have
many topics in common.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
That's right.

29:57.993 --> 30:00.920
Anyway, what do
you think of Shi Yan?

30:05.002 --> 30:06.703
What I meant,

30:07.088 --> 30:08.689
since you both agree,

30:08.714 --> 30:11.224
what are your plans to
work together in the future?

30:12.397 --> 30:15.280
I can't tell you yet.

30:17.382 --> 30:18.504
Understand.

30:18.684 --> 30:21.885
Actually, I want to invite you
for an in-depth interview.

30:21.910 --> 30:23.509
We can talk about
why you came back to China…

30:23.534 --> 30:25.084
and your plans
for the future.

30:25.109 --> 30:27.186
That might inspire
more people to come back.

30:27.211 --> 30:28.576
Yes, that sounds great.

30:28.601 --> 30:30.021
That would be my honor.

30:30.794 --> 30:32.979
I also want to invite you
to attend…

30:33.016 --> 30:35.086
Guan Capital press conference
next week.

30:35.111 --> 30:38.040
This event may help
answer some of your questions…

30:38.407 --> 30:40.578
and prepare
some material for the interview.

30:40.609 --> 30:43.166
Sounds great.
Thank you, Professor Yu.

30:43.191 --> 30:44.391
You're welcome.

30:46.302 --> 30:49.017
Great. Hope
to see you again in Le'an.

30:52.289 --> 30:54.573
Mr. Shi, may I continue
with the signature…

30:54.598 --> 30:56.304
contract with Le'an now?

30:56.587 --> 30:57.908
It's not that easy.

30:57.995 --> 31:01.413
Getting Bruce to join
the R&D team was an important step.

31:01.786 --> 31:03.201
We have solved
the problem externally,

31:03.226 --> 31:05.119
but now we have to
deal with internal problems.

31:06.092 --> 31:07.311
Why do I feel like…

31:07.336 --> 31:09.795
we are facing
internal and external challenges?

31:10.893 --> 31:12.293
Good things take time.

31:12.318 --> 31:13.694
Not that you can see…

31:13.719 --> 31:15.640
sunlight
before dawn now?

31:22.994 --> 31:24.731
Isn't this endless?

31:25.398 --> 31:28.719
Zheng Shu Yi also attended
the Guan Capital press conference.

31:30.398 --> 31:32.592
I wonder who
he's flirting with this time…

31:32.617 --> 31:34.208
and what tricks does he use?

31:35.405 --> 31:39.206
Maybe Shi Yan used
his own influence for Shu Yi.

31:40.394 --> 31:42.377
He took advantage
of her beauty…

31:42.402 --> 31:44.220
to seize something
from someone else.

31:44.403 --> 31:46.222
This is really indecent.

31:53.690 --> 31:55.000
(Invitation card)

31:56.789 --> 31:59.778
Shi Yue, can you please shred
this rejected draft for me?

31:59.803 --> 32:01.803
- I will meet with the author.
- Good.

32:12.389 --> 32:13.821
I'm sorry, Yu Ling.

32:13.886 --> 32:15.826
No problem. Just quote.

32:30.606 --> 32:33.039
Bei Er, are you here
to shred paper too?

32:33.680 --> 32:35.088
I have more papers here,

32:35.113 --> 32:36.725
may take some time.

32:36.991 --> 32:38.272
Call me when you're ready.

32:38.297 --> 32:39.805
I'll go
do my article first.

32:40.192 --> 32:42.420
Why did you leave it here?
I'll sort it out for you.

32:45.886 --> 32:47.632
Thank you, Shi Yue.

32:47.687 --> 32:48.887
It's fine.

33:00.960 --> 33:03.920
(Introduction to Finance)

33:11.687 --> 33:14.311
Nan Nan, did you
see my invitation card?

33:14.500 --> 33:15.667
What invitation card?

33:15.692 --> 33:17.692
Invitation to
Guan Capital press conference.

33:17.800 --> 33:19.718
It was on
this table for a moment.

33:20.201 --> 33:22.611
I just got back from an interview.
I don't even see it.

33:22.691 --> 33:24.010
You search again.

33:26.296 --> 33:28.928
Yue, did you see
my invitation card?

33:29.007 --> 33:30.335
I don't see.

33:30.986 --> 33:33.419
It's strange. I'm sure
I put it here.

33:34.091 --> 33:36.218
I was busy shredding
papers in the storage room.

33:58.991 --> 34:01.640
Shu Yi, Shi Yue didn't
even do that on purpose.

34:01.665 --> 34:02.809
Don't blame him.

34:02.834 --> 34:04.973
After all, he is still new and
does not know many things.

34:04.998 --> 34:06.107
That's right.

34:06.200 --> 34:08.999
You're smart, aren't you? I'm sure
you can get another one.

34:09.306 --> 34:10.683
I didn't do it.

34:10.800 --> 34:12.907
That was not in the paper
I took earlier.

34:13.208 --> 34:16.360
Won't the invitation card have legs
and go into the shredder?

34:16.897 --> 34:19.736
I want to give
you a little advice, Shi Yue.

34:20.202 --> 34:21.920
Just admit your mistakes.

34:22.104 --> 34:24.414
Not a big deal.

34:25.305 --> 34:26.617
If I make a mistake,
I will admit it,

34:26.642 --> 34:28.569
but I didn't do anything wrong.

34:28.593 --> 34:30.593
It's okay, Yue.

34:30.618 --> 34:32.213
It's just an invitation card.

34:32.493 --> 34:34.072
They invited me.

34:34.097 --> 34:35.774
Even without the invitation card,

34:35.799 --> 34:37.422
I can still
find a way in.

34:38.693 --> 34:40.217
Draft your team…

34:41.298 --> 34:43.027
stuck on my invitation card.

34:49.286 --> 34:50.907
How did that happen, Bei Er?

34:51.091 --> 34:52.111
I…

34:52.193 --> 34:53.211
I didn't do it.

34:53.236 --> 34:56.976
I took the draft that
Yu Ling rejected and gave it to the storage room.

34:57.001 --> 34:58.595
I ran
into Shi Yue there.

34:58.620 --> 35:00.313
He offered to
shred the paper for me.

35:00.793 --> 35:02.998
You gave the draft
directly to Shi Yue?

35:09.999 --> 35:12.669
Bei Er, tear up
this rejected draft for me.

35:12.694 --> 35:14.205
- Good.
- Thank You.

35:25.195 --> 35:27.580
Well now, you
didn't do it on purpose.

35:27.605 --> 35:31.104
Shu Yi is a reasonable person.

35:31.485 --> 35:32.520
It's ok.

35:37.793 --> 35:39.693
Shu Yi, I'm really sorry.

35:39.718 --> 35:40.920
This is all my fault.

35:44.998 --> 35:47.621
Bei Er, I believe
it's not your job.

35:47.995 --> 35:50.616
But with today's incident,
I hope you learn...

35:50.804 --> 35:53.017
you should not admit to
mistakes that are not your fault.

36:09.683 --> 36:11.812
Xu Yu Ling is getting more and more extreme.

36:13.698 --> 36:16.600
Apparently, jealousy
can make people crazy.

36:17.893 --> 36:20.122
Blame it on your brilliance.

36:20.491 --> 36:22.826
Have you ever seen
data for digital magazines?

36:22.997 --> 36:25.119
It is at a historic peak.

36:25.800 --> 36:28.280
I heard that
many readers left messages,

36:28.305 --> 36:30.011
say they like this format.

36:30.691 --> 36:33.325
Remember to send a message and
thank Mr. Shi.

36:47.994 --> 36:49.591
Shan Shan said…

36:50.092 --> 36:51.920
I should leave her message
for a few days.

36:52.292 --> 36:53.686
My patience is almost dry,

36:53.711 --> 36:54.917
he still didn't answer.

37:03.495 --> 37:05.373
We are not friends on WeChat.

37:05.398 --> 37:07.115
Even though I posted it,
he couldn't even see it.

37:45.106 --> 37:47.560
There are audio messages too.
That's quite innovative.

37:57.894 --> 38:00.226
This is like a miracle,
even the impossible can happen.

38:00.387 --> 38:02.417
Shi Yan is also doing
his own promotion right now.

38:03.496 --> 38:05.216
You can also
hear Tuan Shi's voice.

38:05.301 --> 38:07.821
After being humble for so long,
he suddenly became famous.

38:13.197 --> 38:14.682
We are not friends on WeChat.

38:14.707 --> 38:16.560
Even though I posted it,
he couldn't even see it.

38:22.099 --> 38:24.474
Guan Ji, you are very kind.

38:24.499 --> 38:25.810
Thank you very much!

38:29.300 --> 38:31.320
What do you ask Guan Ji
to make for you now?

38:32.485 --> 38:34.908
Not for me, for my boss.

38:35.599 --> 38:37.318
But, not for my boss either.

38:38.193 --> 38:39.760
It's hard to explain.

38:44.490 --> 38:45.818
He asked you to do this?

38:45.988 --> 38:47.517
I want to do this for him.

38:47.688 --> 38:50.176
Qin Shi Yue, listen.
You're an adult now.

38:50.201 --> 38:51.706
You yourself need to have the ability
to distinguish things.

38:51.731 --> 38:53.819
Don't just do whatever
someone tells you to do.

38:56.111 --> 38:58.420
Why don't I have the ability
to distinguish things?

38:58.897 --> 39:01.019
And who told
me to do anything?

39:04.793 --> 39:09.280
(Introduction to Finance)

39:13.906 --> 39:15.833
No problem. Thank You.

39:15.911 --> 39:17.726
I'll think of something.

39:33.703 --> 39:36.412
Shi Yue, who
left this on my table?

39:40.712 --> 39:42.088
Do not misunderstand.

39:42.119 --> 39:44.990
I called the
Guan Capital PR department and explained the situation.

39:45.096 --> 39:47.600
They gave me another invitation
after checking the guest list.

39:48.093 --> 39:50.360
You don't have to thank
me. I should do that.

39:51.588 --> 39:53.414
Okay, thank you.

40:05.394 --> 40:06.874
Shu Yi,

40:06.899 --> 40:08.623
I have a gift for you.

40:09.112 --> 40:10.760
This color is elegant and intellectual,

40:10.785 --> 40:12.440
I think it suits you.

40:14.796 --> 40:17.033
But I should be
thanking you.

40:17.397 --> 40:19.026
No, this is a return gift.

40:20.992 --> 40:23.996
You gave me lipstick that day,

40:24.203 --> 40:25.603
so this is just a return gift.

40:25.628 --> 40:27.210
This is a very luxurious return gift .

40:27.483 --> 40:29.601
His family must be rich,

40:29.808 --> 40:32.033
this was probably how he got to know
people at Guan Capital.

40:36.204 --> 40:39.722
Shi Yue, I cannot accept
such a precious gift.

40:39.902 --> 40:41.600
If you really want to
thank me,

40:41.625 --> 40:44.005
just work harder
and do more work.

40:44.705 --> 40:46.080
I…

40:49.288 --> 40:50.687
No matter what I say,

40:50.712 --> 40:53.401
he insisted on
giving me more work.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.369
Do you think Guan Ji can speak
well on stage?

41:07.394 --> 41:09.223
I think he will
do well.

41:26.994 --> 41:28.219
Where are you?

41:34.205 --> 41:39.184
(
Guan Capital Year End Press Conference)

41:42.490 --> 41:44.960
Thank you to all the guests
and media for joining us today.

41:45.076 --> 41:48.815
Over the years, the industry has
seen significant changes,

41:48.898 --> 41:51.205
marks
a turning point in the sector.

41:51.499 --> 41:53.491
Innovation in technology
and business models…

41:53.516 --> 41:56.266
has become a driving force in
our current industrial landscape.

41:56.291 --> 41:57.512
Therefore,

41:57.600 --> 41:59.560
commitment to
practicality and innovation…

41:59.585 --> 42:01.820
will remain the main focus
of Guan Capital.

42:15.994 --> 42:18.122
How did you manage to get
such a good seat?

42:18.507 --> 42:19.930
Someone get it for me.

42:20.609 --> 42:22.012
How do you get in?

42:22.794 --> 42:25.031
I want to go in,
so I just go in.

42:42.914 --> 42:46.320
He looks sexier
when he's serious.
