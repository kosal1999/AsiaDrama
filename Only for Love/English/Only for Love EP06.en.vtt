01:30.951 --> 01:36.082
(Just For Love)

01:36.123 --> 01:39.082
(Episode 6)

01:43.614 --> 01:45.367
Eat it. I want to go back.

01:45.392 --> 01:47.225
Do you want to go home
and wait for Miss Zheng?

01:52.600 --> 01:54.430
Did I say something wrong?

01:54.906 --> 01:56.300
Didn't you say…

01:56.325 --> 01:59.103
you don't want to talk about
personal things at work?

02:09.198 --> 02:11.162
Would it be too sudden
if I went looking for him?

02:12.002 --> 02:15.322
He will get angry and
trouble me more later?

02:17.298 --> 02:18.702
The situation has become like this.

02:18.727 --> 02:20.611
Zheng Shu Yi, you cannot lose.

02:21.003 --> 02:22.783
Who cares whether
he will be angry or not?

02:22.814 --> 02:25.607
I must get
a specific response today.

03:33.895 --> 03:37.297
Miss Zheng, why did you come
to see me at this time?

03:38.117 --> 03:40.070
My draft is already like this.

03:40.095 --> 03:42.031
You don't know what this is about?

03:44.901 --> 03:47.167
I just feel that...

03:47.192 --> 03:49.807
you might want to see me,
so I came looking for you.

03:56.598 --> 03:57.782
Try to tell me.

03:57.807 --> 03:59.402
Why do you think
I want to see you?

04:01.089 --> 04:04.522
If not, why did you reject my draft three times ?

04:06.696 --> 04:08.319
Oh, I see?

04:08.600 --> 04:11.122
You can stand it, you are confident and firm.

04:11.307 --> 04:13.195
Your logic flows smoothly.

04:13.220 --> 04:14.682
I almost thought so too.

04:17.290 --> 04:18.380
My draft,

04:18.405 --> 04:20.298
even my author and editor-in-chief…

04:20.323 --> 04:23.088
the most critical in
the financial journalism industry…

04:23.113 --> 04:24.699
can't even find
any mistakes.

04:24.724 --> 04:26.297
But you turned him down three times...

04:26.322 --> 04:28.223
without giving any
specific feedback.

04:31.202 --> 04:34.642
Is there any reason
other than to see me?

04:43.600 --> 04:45.408
My reason is…

04:45.894 --> 04:47.206
I'm not satisfied.

04:47.705 --> 04:48.823
Not satisfied?

04:49.203 --> 04:50.266
What are you not satisfied with?

04:50.294 --> 04:53.322
Show me any issues, and I'll
check them until you're satisfied.

05:00.598 --> 05:02.206
If you can't
say what you are not satisfied with,

05:02.231 --> 05:03.965
that proves that you
want to meet me.

05:03.990 --> 05:06.336
You deliberately used this way
to get my attention,

05:06.361 --> 05:07.802
so that I can come
to see you.

05:10.894 --> 05:13.665
In the first draft, there were many
words that were too complimentary.

05:13.690 --> 05:15.788
I believe an excellent personal interview …

05:15.819 --> 05:17.977
should be different from
normal corporate PR material.

05:18.002 --> 05:20.621
Writing should be
more rational and objective.

05:21.001 --> 05:22.482
Journalists can have their choice,

05:22.507 --> 05:25.224
but that should not affect
the reader's reading and thinking.

05:27.299 --> 05:29.282
You should be
aware of this problem.

05:29.307 --> 05:32.511
So, in the second draft, you
change it to an objective article.

05:32.597 --> 05:34.217
You don't miss
any content.

05:34.402 --> 05:36.228
However, because
you care too much…

05:36.253 --> 05:37.866
about its perfection
and objectivity,

05:37.891 --> 05:39.696
the draft lacks emphasis.

05:39.997 --> 05:42.985
The focus of this interview should
be Yunchuang's future,

05:43.010 --> 05:45.718
not the Mingyu Group, and certainly
not my personal development.

05:48.293 --> 05:51.633
So, what about
the latest draft? What is the problem?

05:52.200 --> 05:54.115
You put a lot of effort into that draft,

05:54.140 --> 05:55.881
and many issues have been fixed.

05:55.906 --> 05:58.482
But I think there should be
room for discussion.

05:58.785 --> 06:01.215
I still remember
saying this in the car that day.

06:01.311 --> 06:04.878
I believe in
the company's technical ability and innovation…

06:04.903 --> 06:08.718
to some extent determine
its competitiveness and core development.

06:08.902 --> 06:11.463
I express this view
to facilitate discussion,

06:11.488 --> 06:12.914
not to draw conclusions.

06:13.294 --> 06:16.322
Therefore, I think when you
produce an official article,

06:16.416 --> 06:20.792
should more faithfully represent
my true expression and attitude.

06:22.501 --> 06:25.511
I humbly
accept your opinion.

06:25.796 --> 06:28.416
This fact is not
clear enough as I wrote,

06:28.801 --> 06:30.996
but everyone has
a different interpretation.

06:31.021 --> 06:33.092
You can't
ask me to rewrite it…

06:33.117 --> 06:34.808
whole article
just because of one issue.

06:34.901 --> 06:36.566
The draft has been delayed for a long time.

06:36.591 --> 06:37.698
If I don't hand it over quickly,

06:37.723 --> 06:39.617
our magazine has no
cover story this time.

06:39.891 --> 06:42.083
I really want to
write this article well.

06:42.108 --> 06:43.410
Please help me.

06:44.012 --> 06:46.468
Yunchuang is a
very reputable company…

06:46.500 --> 06:48.535
and always pursue thoroughness.

06:48.595 --> 06:49.813
Due to different interpretations,

06:49.838 --> 06:52.207
you have written my words
in a more absolute way,

06:52.232 --> 06:54.882
represent my personal views and judgments.

06:55.408 --> 06:58.796
But what I want to explore more
is the potential of this industry.

06:58.821 --> 07:00.227
It means completely different,

07:00.392 --> 07:02.682
and the generated impact
will certainly be much different.

07:04.893 --> 07:06.614
I understand what you mean now.

07:07.195 --> 07:09.811
If so, I'll
fix it now.

07:28.591 --> 07:29.791
Come here.

07:30.993 --> 07:32.373
Don't you want to
redo the draft?

07:32.398 --> 07:33.535
Fix it inside.

07:48.691 --> 07:52.018
Isn't it difficult to fix
the draft at home at this time?

07:52.189 --> 07:54.704
What if I run
into his nephew again?

07:59.391 --> 08:03.726
Mr. Shi, is it okay for me to go to
your house at this time?

08:05.493 --> 08:06.897
You have come
to my house.

08:06.922 --> 08:09.109
Now you're starting to worry
if this bothers me?

08:11.200 --> 08:13.018
I'm just excited
to revise the draft.

08:14.401 --> 08:16.828
Don't worry, no one
can bother you.

08:17.202 --> 08:20.136
You can definitely fix it
to my satisfaction.

09:11.592 --> 09:13.624
He actually came here
to re-correct the draft.

09:23.797 --> 09:26.223
Yue, are you sure this will work?

09:26.895 --> 09:28.282
Why not?

09:28.589 --> 09:32.335
This gift is amazing
even for my uncle and aunt.

09:32.895 --> 09:34.408
This wine is really good.

09:35.485 --> 09:38.020
But I advise you
not to have high hopes.

09:38.296 --> 09:41.627
If he knows you gave him
this wine so he won't make you work,

09:41.652 --> 09:43.211
I don't know how
he will react.

09:45.095 --> 09:46.865
Why don't you give
me this wine?

09:46.890 --> 09:48.090
Do not waste.

09:48.489 --> 09:49.807
Don't be shy.

09:50.094 --> 09:52.379
I hope this will save
me from this desperate situation.

09:52.404 --> 09:53.884
You don't want to help me,

09:53.909 --> 09:55.688
even my grandfather doesn't want to help me.

09:55.804 --> 09:59.025
This bottle of wine is
my only savior.

10:51.603 --> 10:52.820
what do you want to drink

10:53.388 --> 10:55.428
Lemon juice, thank you.

11:15.396 --> 11:16.724
Thank you, Mr. Shi.

11:20.194 --> 11:21.931
He has a good memory.

13:10.893 --> 13:12.093
Why?

13:12.494 --> 13:14.019
Are you having any problems?

13:14.992 --> 13:16.192
So.

13:17.102 --> 13:18.482
So, what's the problem?

13:21.497 --> 13:23.221
I want…

13:24.088 --> 13:26.162
drink the drink you're holding.

13:54.402 --> 13:55.602
Thank You.

14:25.097 --> 14:27.100
He immediately didn't look at me.

14:27.591 --> 14:30.162
It seems that this lipstick color
is not effective.

15:03.690 --> 15:04.890
Helo?

15:10.701 --> 15:12.728
I'm very busy. That's inconvenient.

15:14.545 --> 15:15.858
Don't, sir!

15:15.883 --> 15:17.132
Mistress?

15:27.400 --> 15:28.762
Why?

15:30.293 --> 15:31.920
Does anyone want to come?

15:32.291 --> 15:33.491
So.

15:35.596 --> 15:38.430
Does your niece want to go back?

15:40.497 --> 15:43.115
You seem very
interested in my niece.

15:44.692 --> 15:46.774
No, why?

15:46.799 --> 15:48.118
I don't know him.

15:52.492 --> 15:55.418
He said he was very busy
and troublesome.

15:56.897 --> 15:58.922
He said the same thing when
I called him that day.

16:00.102 --> 16:02.106
What trouble is
there for a man?

16:02.196 --> 16:03.714
But he's with a woman.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.011
I think your uncle must
be hiding the girl in his house.

16:08.399 --> 16:10.519
Hide girls in his house?

16:11.985 --> 16:13.286
It's been three years.

16:13.311 --> 16:15.820
Finally, my uncle
fell in love with someone.

16:16.290 --> 16:17.916
Have you ever met that girl?

16:19.497 --> 16:22.129
Shi Yan didn't let me see him.
Where can I find him?

16:23.190 --> 16:25.418
Did you ever see him
bring his girlfriend back?

16:29.296 --> 16:31.093
It's ready. Look at it.

16:42.497 --> 16:43.697
What kind of?

16:44.196 --> 16:45.430
Too long.

16:48.996 --> 16:50.196
Okay.

16:56.103 --> 16:58.311
I can't believe I
can't fix it again.

17:04.294 --> 17:05.480
I have summarized.

17:05.505 --> 17:07.828
Mr. Shi, please check
if there is any problem.

17:16.809 --> 17:19.015
That's not what I mean
when I say this.

17:21.196 --> 17:22.719
If so,
what do you mean?

17:22.993 --> 17:24.193
Think for yourself.

17:28.907 --> 17:30.727
Why don't I write
to you straight away?

18:15.789 --> 18:16.989
Okey.

18:18.686 --> 18:19.886
Really?

18:20.899 --> 18:23.213
Really nothing to
fix again?

18:23.394 --> 18:24.594
Approximately.

18:28.598 --> 18:30.479
If you are satisfied,

18:30.504 --> 18:33.521
does that mean we
can go further?

18:43.505 --> 18:45.120
Go further?

18:48.192 --> 18:50.308
Go further…

18:51.708 --> 18:53.826
to explore
the possibility of a special coverage.

18:54.506 --> 18:56.378
Since you are
satisfied with my draft,

18:56.403 --> 18:57.609
surely you will be satisfied with…

18:57.634 --> 18:59.280
my proofreading service
too.

18:59.893 --> 19:04.040
So, can you consider the
special coverage I mentioned earlier?

19:09.215 --> 19:11.228
If I go
further with you,

19:11.692 --> 19:13.212
what benefits are offered?

19:21.291 --> 19:23.384
If you accept my proposal,

19:23.409 --> 19:26.004
I will definitely prepare
the articles for this series well.

19:26.029 --> 19:27.514
I guarantee you will be satisfied.

19:30.207 --> 19:31.366
But…

19:31.391 --> 19:33.533
I have a small request.

19:36.198 --> 19:38.391
I hope these articles
can be published…

19:38.416 --> 19:40.217
in the
Financial Introduction digital magazine.

19:43.401 --> 19:45.880
Is this how journalists in
Financial Introduction do business?

19:46.300 --> 19:48.373
I have not agreed to
your interview for special coverage,

19:48.398 --> 19:50.210
and you have
made additional demands.

19:55.594 --> 19:57.812
Sorry for not thinking.

19:57.990 --> 19:59.876
I should have taken it
step by step…

19:59.901 --> 20:01.926
and discuss this
after completing this interview.

20:08.401 --> 20:10.920
Did I say something
that offended him?

20:13.096 --> 20:14.366
Mr. Shi said…

20:14.391 --> 20:16.313
he doesn't like to discuss
personal matters during work hours…

20:16.338 --> 20:17.493
and at work.

20:17.518 --> 20:18.718
That's right.

20:18.999 --> 20:20.888
He doesn't like
to discuss personal matters…

20:20.913 --> 20:22.489
during working hours
and at work.

20:22.520 --> 20:24.213
He may not like
to discuss work matters…

20:24.247 --> 20:26.226
during private time and
in private space as well.

20:30.398 --> 20:34.605
Mr. Shi, please
consider my suggestion.

20:36.091 --> 20:39.960
Also, can you send me an email
confirming the draft now?

20:42.791 --> 20:43.904
Follow the procedure,

20:43.929 --> 20:46.189
this should be confirmed by
our company's PR Department.

20:46.214 --> 20:48.322
I will check it again tomorrow.

20:48.706 --> 20:49.881
All right, Mr. Shi.

20:49.906 --> 20:52.221
If you have any
problems tomorrow, just let me know.

20:52.401 --> 20:54.817
I have no problem. I can
cooperate and fix it again.

20:59.203 --> 21:00.600
Are you sure there is no problem?

21:02.405 --> 21:03.947
I'm sure there is no problem.

21:06.486 --> 21:07.568
You sit so long…

21:07.593 --> 21:09.673
at the house of a man I don't
know very well late at night.

21:09.698 --> 21:11.319
Your boyfriend
has no problem with it?

21:13.092 --> 21:14.521
I don't have a boyfriend.

21:20.585 --> 21:21.818
That's right.

21:22.598 --> 21:24.677
The first day I
met you,

21:24.702 --> 21:26.597
I broke up with him
after I came back.

21:27.198 --> 21:30.717
On the day of the Guan Capital ceremony,
outside the Warner Property.

21:30.801 --> 21:32.122
You still remember, don't you?

21:39.092 --> 21:40.292
So?

21:42.199 --> 21:43.932
So…

21:49.792 --> 21:51.229
can i chase you

22:11.599 --> 22:13.323
If I say no,

22:14.305 --> 22:15.607
will you stop

22:16.494 --> 22:17.694
So.

22:18.992 --> 22:20.621
So why are you asking me?

22:23.091 --> 22:25.179
I just followed the procedure…

22:25.204 --> 22:26.908
to show
you respect.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.429
Thank you for
respecting me.

22:33.997 --> 22:36.321
The draft is finished.
You can go now.

22:55.397 --> 22:56.508
Mr. Shi, good night.

22:56.533 --> 22:58.132
I will add you
on WeChat when I get back.

23:01.695 --> 23:03.790
I can chat
with you when you are bored.

23:03.815 --> 23:06.320
I am very good at chatting.
I have a lot of emoji stickers.

23:22.796 --> 23:24.813
Let me remind you
one last time.

23:25.183 --> 23:28.040
Your uncle will not be happy
if you show up at this time.

23:28.599 --> 23:29.664
I do not care.

23:29.689 --> 23:31.718
I want to see who that girl is.

23:32.001 --> 23:34.921
My uncle never brought
his girlfriend back before.

23:35.003 --> 23:37.318
I want to see who
that extraordinary woman is.

23:37.992 --> 23:40.470
How do you know my uncle's mood
is good because he's in love,

23:40.500 --> 23:41.926
he won't tell me to go to work.

23:49.560 --> 23:50.798
It's strange.

23:50.829 --> 23:53.329
Shouldn't he be
busy re-correcting the draft?

23:53.596 --> 23:55.104
What is he doing here?

23:55.183 --> 23:56.383
Who's that?

23:57.286 --> 23:58.486
Why?

23:58.692 --> 24:00.726
My uncle did not allow
me to reveal my identity.

24:00.992 --> 24:03.779
Everyone knows that you
are the young master of the Guan family.

24:03.810 --> 24:05.827
I don't want to be involved with you.

24:07.286 --> 24:08.498
Who's that?

24:08.523 --> 24:10.326
He is the senior
I told you about.

24:10.412 --> 24:12.825
He criticizes me a lot.

24:19.106 --> 24:21.220
The value for journalists
is so high now?

24:21.811 --> 24:24.032
I advise you not to
have any ill will towards him.

24:24.193 --> 24:26.219
My uncle doesn't like him.

24:26.399 --> 24:28.618
He rejected the draft several times.

24:28.901 --> 24:32.200
Of course, especially because
you love me so much.

24:58.010 --> 24:59.210
where is he

24:59.692 --> 25:00.921
Where is that girl?

25:07.786 --> 25:09.303
Lipstick?

25:10.090 --> 25:11.716
There is indeed a woman.

25:11.991 --> 25:13.209
Why did you come here?

25:14.091 --> 25:15.828
Didn't I tell you
to go back to your grandfather's house?

25:17.294 --> 25:19.614
I came to deliver
this wine to aunt.

25:20.794 --> 25:23.488
Good things should be sent
to uncle as soon as possible.

25:23.513 --> 25:25.395
What if you are too
busy and don't have time to...

25:25.420 --> 25:26.709
eat at grandpa's house?

25:27.490 --> 25:29.486
Just park here and
come back early to rest,

25:29.511 --> 25:31.485
don't get
up to work tomorrow.

25:31.510 --> 25:33.911
You better have self-awareness
to be an employee now.

25:37.692 --> 25:40.714
Uncle, why don't you ask
the girl to stay the night?

25:41.792 --> 25:43.126
What girl?

25:43.516 --> 25:46.620
The woman that uncle and aunt
just drank with.

25:46.994 --> 25:49.327
It's very late, why
didn't you tell him to stay the night?

25:50.103 --> 25:53.008
Is it because she's not pretty enough?

25:54.795 --> 25:56.931
Or did he reject you?

25:58.798 --> 26:00.221
Or maybe…

26:00.246 --> 26:03.018
It's been a long time since you've been in love
until you're scared now?

26:05.795 --> 26:08.333
What's wrong with Shi Yan?

26:08.399 --> 26:09.609
Right, right?

26:09.900 --> 26:12.564
This is the first time I express my feelings
to someone in my life.

26:12.589 --> 26:14.572
and he kicked me out
after hearing that.

26:14.597 --> 26:16.110
Is this reasonable?

26:16.296 --> 26:18.007
Is Shi Yan a man?

26:19.795 --> 26:22.401
Now I'm sure
he's a man,

26:22.600 --> 26:24.634
he's just a
childish man.

26:25.299 --> 26:27.506
- Shi Yan childish?
- Yes.

26:27.793 --> 26:30.224
Have you ever heard of
"men are forever young"?

26:30.795 --> 26:32.905
When they are not honest
with themselves,

26:32.930 --> 26:34.613
women will have no chance.

26:34.706 --> 26:36.901
Have you never read a novel
about an arrogant CEO?

26:36.999 --> 26:40.240
The more the man likes you,
the more he doesn't want to admit it.

26:40.402 --> 26:43.306
The more he likes you,
the more he wants to bully you.

26:43.388 --> 26:44.930
Shi Yan is that kind of man.

26:49.906 --> 26:51.222
Qin Shi Yue.

26:51.393 --> 26:53.719
What nonsense is
playing in your mind?

26:54.194 --> 26:57.002
Uncle invited him to drink at home
this late at night.

26:57.102 --> 26:59.181
After drinking, uncle
told him to leave,

26:59.213 --> 27:00.816
without spending
some time together.

27:01.077 --> 27:02.214
Oh God.

27:02.252 --> 27:04.324
Is this man itchy?

27:06.901 --> 27:09.932
You're talking about itchy guys.

27:10.497 --> 27:12.093
That's about it.

27:12.118 --> 27:13.508
Try to understand it.

27:13.596 --> 27:15.932
If not, why
will he keep rejecting your draft?

27:16.488 --> 27:17.688
Because…

27:18.186 --> 27:20.625
there is an issue with my draft.

27:21.289 --> 27:23.601
Of course, that's part
of the reason.

27:23.626 --> 27:26.913
But the most important thing is that
he wants to attract your attention.

27:27.898 --> 27:29.610
He must be interested in you.

27:31.298 --> 27:34.920
I really admire
your inexplicable confidence.

27:35.907 --> 27:39.712
This is a conclusion I have come
to through many practical experiences.

27:39.795 --> 27:42.464
As the saying goes,
experience is the best teacher.

27:42.990 --> 27:45.171
Although the trick is
a bit old, but effective.

27:47.503 --> 27:49.010
But why do you…

27:49.189 --> 27:51.730
suddenly expressed
feelings to him today?

27:51.998 --> 27:54.137
Maybe you have
fallen in love with him.

27:56.194 --> 27:57.584
How could it be?

27:57.609 --> 27:59.523
I did that for my article.

28:01.503 --> 28:03.187
You didn't tell me to…

28:03.212 --> 28:05.817
So why do I feel like
something is wrong?

28:05.991 --> 28:09.176
The two of you are alone
and the atmosphere feels attractive.

28:09.201 --> 28:11.445
And you suddenly
expressed your feelings to him.

28:12.698 --> 28:16.760
Could it be that you have been attracted to him for a long time without realizing it?

28:20.397 --> 28:22.408
Think carefully about what I'm saying.

28:23.085 --> 28:24.294
I don't want to talk
to you anymore.

28:24.319 --> 28:26.320
I want to go back.
I have to work tomorrow.

28:28.092 --> 28:31.505
To be honest, I think he's
interested in you too.

28:31.622 --> 28:34.607
If you are both interested,
what are you waiting for?

28:34.903 --> 28:38.225
Grab this opportunity before you miss it.

28:42.983 --> 28:44.523
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

28:44.902 --> 28:47.012
Use up food, don't waste it.

28:53.402 --> 28:56.089
When it comes to love,
you need to learn from Guan Ji.

28:56.114 --> 28:57.720
Don't be insensitive.

28:57.991 --> 29:01.303
If you really like it,
you need to take the initiative.

29:01.696 --> 29:03.407
If you invite him to come,

29:03.432 --> 29:05.526
You should take
this opportunity before you miss it.

29:07.724 --> 29:10.509
You still have time
to fool around here.

29:10.598 --> 29:13.022
It seems that working at
the magazine company is really easy.

29:13.095 --> 29:14.175
This is how.

29:14.200 --> 29:15.876
Come and continue working in Yunchuang.

29:15.901 --> 29:17.314
Stop being lazy.

29:18.695 --> 29:19.876
That's okay, thank you.

29:19.901 --> 29:21.828
Uncle, rest early.

29:22.197 --> 29:25.189
Working at a magazine company
is not easy at all.

29:25.214 --> 29:27.515
I didn't finish work until
after eight o'clock today.

29:27.615 --> 29:28.766
I'm busy all day.

29:28.791 --> 29:31.203
I work hard and
take it very seriously.

29:31.300 --> 29:33.320
I need to go back and rest.

29:33.497 --> 29:34.868
Don't make a sad face
in front of me.

29:34.893 --> 29:36.023
Not effective.

29:36.097 --> 29:37.297
Also…

29:41.101 --> 29:42.717
Save your money for this wine.

30:28.520 --> 30:31.080
(Thinking calmly)

30:40.392 --> 30:42.618
Shi Yan didn't say
I can't chase him,

30:43.105 --> 30:44.723
so he agreed without saying a word.

30:45.198 --> 30:46.508
What am I waiting for?

30:51.040 --> 30:53.040
(Searching.
The user does not exist.)

30:56.010 --> 30:59.327
Mr. Shi, how afraid are you that others
will find your WeChat account?

31:05.596 --> 31:07.003
I have reached home.

31:08.100 --> 31:10.520
Mr. Shi, are you asleep?

31:11.107 --> 31:12.919
I think you must be very busy.

31:16.395 --> 31:19.520
You only need to read the
first three sentences of the previous message.

31:24.211 --> 31:25.710
I saw this online.

31:25.741 --> 31:28.528
It can express
my feelings without being too ridiculous.

31:28.606 --> 31:29.806
Just perfect.

31:37.914 --> 31:39.389
Today will be cloudy with
light rain tonight,

31:39.414 --> 31:40.891
with temperatures ranging from 5 to 12°C.

31:40.916 --> 31:42.472
Tomorrow will be cloudy changing
to partly cloudy,

31:42.497 --> 31:43.828
with a temperature between 3 and 10°C.

31:44.188 --> 31:46.077
There will be continuous rain
in the coming days,

31:46.102 --> 31:47.471
coincides with the work week.

31:47.496 --> 31:49.729
Don't forget to plan
your trip accordingly.

31:49.754 --> 31:51.026
Make sure to stay warm.

31:56.497 --> 31:57.791
Mr. and Mrs.

31:57.816 --> 32:00.282
When it comes to love,
you need to learn from Guan Ji.

32:00.307 --> 32:02.014
Don't be insensitive.

32:02.388 --> 32:05.473
If you really like it,
you need to take the initiative.

32:05.498 --> 32:06.999
If you invite him to come,

32:07.024 --> 32:09.325
You should take
this opportunity before you miss it.

32:23.082 --> 32:24.760
(Actress)

32:42.707 --> 32:44.115
Nyahlanggan?

32:45.497 --> 32:47.320
Shi Yan, what about you?

33:03.996 --> 33:06.884
Mr. Shi, I just got
a call from Le'an Technology.

33:06.909 --> 33:09.594
They said they have reviewed
our financing group plan.

33:09.619 --> 33:10.995
Mr. Chen said…

33:11.020 --> 33:13.259
while the funding pool
provides some reassurance…

33:13.284 --> 33:14.746
for their future research and development,

33:14.771 --> 33:16.365
there is still quite a big gap…

33:16.390 --> 33:18.631
compared to
Lieying's acquisition price at the current level.

33:19.018 --> 33:20.899
So, they are very
concerned about the solution…

33:20.924 --> 33:22.712
to the technical issue
you mentioned during the day.

33:24.598 --> 33:27.473
Mr. Shi,
our final offer is the highest price…

33:27.498 --> 33:28.928
that we can give.

33:30.294 --> 33:33.258
Even if there is an increase, it cannot
match the acquisition price.

33:33.283 --> 33:34.562
If we continue to be stranded here,

33:34.593 --> 33:36.310
will that lead
to change?

33:36.891 --> 33:38.921
I understand. Go to work first.

33:50.484 --> 33:52.698
do you have time
Let's meet and talk.

34:27.009 --> 34:28.384
Shu Yi, good morning.

34:28.409 --> 34:29.619
Good morning, Shi Yue.

34:35.796 --> 34:36.996
Why?

34:37.201 --> 34:38.607
Nothing.

34:38.697 --> 34:40.620
Your lipstick looks beautiful.

34:43.905 --> 34:45.105
Take it.

34:45.997 --> 34:47.197
I…

34:58.797 --> 35:00.127
Not that.

35:01.690 --> 35:05.209
He usually never
used colors like that.

35:09.003 --> 35:12.617
It seems that Zheng Shu Yi's draft was rejected
several times by Yunchuang.

35:12.809 --> 35:15.406
He had never been
in a situation like this before.

35:16.194 --> 35:18.526
How do you know he didn't
offend anyone?

35:18.797 --> 35:21.076
Encountering a client who rejects a draft
without giving feedback…

35:21.101 --> 35:22.328
very difficult.

35:24.423 --> 35:28.015
So, uncle is indeed
my biological uncle.

35:28.197 --> 35:30.923
But Zheng Shu Yi
might not be that woman.

35:31.203 --> 35:34.176
Who deliberately makes
their loved ones suffer?

35:34.201 --> 35:35.628
Is that humane?

35:36.301 --> 35:37.585
But…

35:37.610 --> 35:40.617
My aunt may like this.

35:41.007 --> 35:43.240
I think he can
do that.

35:50.795 --> 35:52.080
Zheng Shu Yi.

35:52.294 --> 35:54.360
Can you stop
being so diligent?

35:54.516 --> 35:56.728
At least
give us a break.

35:59.286 --> 36:02.440
Guaranteeing Guan's Capital was
an important step for Mingyu Yunchuang.

36:02.805 --> 36:05.697
Capital Guan invited
Yu You back here at this time.

36:05.790 --> 36:08.379
And Shi Yan went to
his welcome party.

36:09.102 --> 36:12.029
You have chosen the next topic.

36:12.110 --> 36:13.822
You didn't give us a chance.

36:15.002 --> 36:17.121
Why? Have you taken care of Shi Yan?

36:18.898 --> 36:20.098
Approximately.

36:23.092 --> 36:26.640
Yu You's opinion should be important
for the decision of Guan Capital.

36:27.075 --> 36:30.796
Talking to him will surely
give many clues.

36:31.910 --> 36:34.095
Actually, it's not hard to
guess what Shi Yan wants to do.

36:34.126 --> 36:36.697
But the key is how
he will continue each step.

36:36.894 --> 36:39.432
Readers must be very
interested in this.

37:18.683 --> 37:20.723
Good. All 10 loops.

37:25.810 --> 37:27.576
Rock climbing day duration.
This time, shoot.

37:27.601 --> 37:29.721
You really don't look
like a college professor.

37:31.307 --> 37:33.534
You also don't look
like a rich second generation.

37:35.200 --> 37:37.817
Actually, Bruce is also quite different.

37:38.491 --> 37:39.625
What kind of difference?

37:39.991 --> 37:41.607
The domestic market is vast,

37:41.632 --> 37:43.990
and the terms you offered
Bruce were very attractive.

37:44.015 --> 37:46.529
Many people would consider
this a good choice.

37:47.483 --> 37:48.695
But Bruce is just like me.

37:48.720 --> 37:51.110
He loves excitement,
adventure, and challenge.

37:51.299 --> 37:53.272
So, pay and conditions are not…

37:53.297 --> 37:55.489
the main factors
to consider.

37:55.802 --> 37:58.817
So, don't try to predict or
judge him with fixed thoughts.

37:59.485 --> 38:00.604
He will come next week.

38:00.629 --> 38:02.225
Have you thought of a way
to convince him?

38:03.519 --> 38:05.022
Do you have any suggestions?

38:06.796 --> 38:10.633
We both like to do
interesting and challenging things.

38:10.892 --> 38:12.431
Actually, so did Bruce.

38:12.687 --> 38:15.621
Exciting and challenging,
both are indispensable.

38:18.304 --> 38:20.506
So, why are
you willing to go back to China?

38:21.997 --> 38:24.434
Actually, the
academic environment is getting better here.

38:24.595 --> 38:27.319
And I also get to know
friends like you and Guan Ji.

38:28.194 --> 38:30.379
Speaking of which,
you are very attractive.

38:30.404 --> 38:32.019
What you do
is also very challenging.

38:32.099 --> 38:34.793
You can accept
Mingyu Group's offer and make everyone happy,

38:34.818 --> 38:36.165
but you chose to
start your own business…

38:36.190 --> 38:37.584
and established Yunchuang.

38:37.615 --> 38:39.816
Isn't it fun
working with you?

38:41.401 --> 38:43.211
Apparently I'm so
annoying, huh?

38:44.312 --> 38:47.306
But I believe if I
can pull you back to China,

38:47.331 --> 38:49.511
I can definitely pull Bruce too.

38:50.398 --> 38:54.829
And I'm sure Bruce will be
amazed by Chen Kang's enthusiasm.

39:02.198 --> 39:03.825
Sorry, I have to answer this call.

39:05.284 --> 39:06.453
Helo.

39:06.478 --> 39:08.412
Professor Yu, saya Zheng Shu Yi.

39:08.504 --> 39:10.240
I wonder if
you still remember me.

39:10.603 --> 39:12.280
Miss Zheng,
of course I remember you.

39:12.305 --> 39:14.488
Here, the duration of the day
is too hasty,

39:14.513 --> 39:16.165
and I didn't have time
to talk to you.

39:16.190 --> 39:17.896
I want to schedule time
with you next week…

39:17.921 --> 39:20.413
to ask you
some questions about the industry.

39:20.500 --> 39:21.897
Okay, okay.

39:22.089 --> 39:24.416
Let me check my schedule and
get back to you later.

39:24.810 --> 39:26.400
OK, thank you very much.

39:26.425 --> 39:27.625
Good.

39:34.799 --> 39:36.404
can i chase you

39:45.196 --> 39:46.827
Come on, one more round.

39:48.107 --> 39:51.602
Ms. Yi, I have reviewed
my interview article with Guan Ji.

39:51.629 --> 39:53.412
Ready for
layout and printing.

39:58.487 --> 39:59.687
Cik Yi?

40:02.801 --> 40:05.006
Ms. Yi, Mr. Shi has already
confirmed verbally.

40:05.031 --> 40:06.785
Yunchuang will respond
officially soon.

40:06.810 --> 40:08.521
This version of the article should be okay.

40:09.394 --> 40:11.994
Shu Yi, we understand that you
have worked hard this time,

40:12.019 --> 40:14.160
but we need to take into account
the overall situation.

40:14.185 --> 40:16.301
Can we rely
on verbal confirmation?

40:16.388 --> 40:17.992
Front page content
is not child's play.

40:18.017 --> 40:20.705
If mistakes happen,
the responsibility will be great.

40:21.611 --> 40:23.208
I am confident in my article.

40:23.233 --> 40:24.495
And Mr. Shi also promised…

40:24.520 --> 40:26.192
will
email me confirmation today.

40:26.217 --> 40:28.882
What good is your faith now?

40:28.907 --> 40:31.075
If there is a problem, how
will you be responsible?

40:31.100 --> 40:32.521
Are you going to resign?

40:33.906 --> 40:36.000
Since he agreed to
reply by today,

40:36.025 --> 40:37.926
let's wait
until midnight.

40:38.292 --> 40:41.480
If there is no answer or
not approved by Yunchuang,

40:41.809 --> 40:45.214
so we will use Yu Ling's article
as the front cover.

40:45.807 --> 40:47.019
I have no problem with that.

40:47.495 --> 40:48.695
How about you?

40:49.093 --> 40:50.405
I have no problem either.

41:11.399 --> 41:12.892
You looked less focused earlier.

41:12.917 --> 41:14.324
Not like your usual standard.

41:20.892 --> 41:22.719
Mr. Shi, this is important.

41:22.807 --> 41:24.760
You confirmed
my draft yesterday.

41:24.791 --> 41:26.720
Please send me
a confirmation as soon as possible.

41:31.394 --> 41:33.680
Really? Let's do another round.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.994
Ms. Zheng, Mr. Shi
is not with me today.

41:41.019 --> 41:43.392
He might be busy.
I can't even contact him.

41:43.417 --> 41:44.912
I can't help you.

41:48.280 --> 41:52.320
(Storage room)

42:00.086 --> 42:01.829
It's too late now.

42:01.920 --> 42:03.897
So why not approved?

42:03.992 --> 42:05.769
What are we waiting for here?

42:05.794 --> 42:06.808
What can we do?

42:06.833 --> 42:09.166
We work in the
news industry. We have to be careful.

42:09.191 --> 42:11.086
We agreed to wait until
12 midnight, so just wait,

42:11.111 --> 42:12.680
not even a minute less.
