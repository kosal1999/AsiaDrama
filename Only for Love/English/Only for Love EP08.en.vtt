"Only for love"

01:36.123 --> 01:39.282
Section (8)

01:39.879 --> 01:42.429
Let's give a warm welcome

01:52.421 --> 01:55.291
Thank you for your valuable time and listening

01:55.455 --> 01:57.416
In the future, Kuon Group will
continue to innovate and...

01:57.496 --> 02:00.006
We will continue to work on recruiting professionals

02:00.087 --> 02:03.648
This year we
were able to bring in new blood and energy

02:03.834 --> 02:04.834
Continued...

02:05.200 --> 02:08.419
The new partner of Kuon Group

02:08.539 --> 02:09.779
Strategy advisor...

02:09.880 --> 02:11.241
Bring Professor Yu to the stage

02:27.280 --> 02:29.111
Hello everyone, I'm Yoyo

02:29.388 --> 02:31.486
After being admitted to the group

02:31.576 --> 02:33.666
I am proud to see such an important development

02:37.874 --> 02:40.202
Is it really a meeting to see each other's news ?

02:40.240 --> 02:42.682
Great men
come out in groups

02:43.516 --> 02:47.482
Looking at this YouTube, he's handsome,
young, and talented

02:50.455 --> 02:52.602
Compared to the barn

02:52.879 --> 02:54.138
It is not easy to compare

02:55.376 --> 02:56.722
You too

02:56.895 --> 02:58.886
What do you think of the two of them compared to Shi Xian ?

03:00.772 --> 03:06.755
Shi Xiang is like an unreasonable and irritable
little spirit

03:06.953 --> 03:10.702
No one can match him in this department

03:33.495 --> 03:35.405
(Why will it be chilly)

03:38.655 --> 03:41.002
The group's steps
have become more and more wide

03:41.171 --> 03:42.296
Yes

03:44.595 --> 03:46.584
This side is our strategy department

03:46.703 --> 03:47.802
Nice to meet you

03:47.880 --> 03:49.522
I will rely on you

03:54.016 --> 03:56.122
Don't worry just a moment

03:57.775 --> 03:59.616
Hello reporter, I
see you again

03:59.760 --> 04:00.820
Hello

04:01.360 --> 04:04.602
But this meeting
took many turns

04:05.016 --> 04:06.362
Tell me

04:06.584 --> 04:08.052
It's a bit embarrassing to say the least

04:08.133 --> 04:09.667
An accident happened

04:09.775 --> 04:11.726
I lost the invitation you gave me

04:11.896 --> 04:13.995
Then my colleague
helped me find another one

04:14.080 --> 04:15.107
At the end of the day, it's like this

04:15.188 --> 04:16.859
In fact, you
should contact me again

04:17.655 --> 04:18.715
Yes indeed

04:19.016 --> 04:20.482
Still need a one-on-one interview?

04:20.640 --> 04:22.562
I can help you after he works

04:22.969 --> 04:25.562
Thankfully, my partner
just had hers last week

04:26.720 --> 04:27.980
Shuyi

04:29.157 --> 04:30.517
This is my good friend

04:30.598 --> 04:32.378
Reporter of the Sanjiang Connect Entertainment Network

04:32.459 --> 04:33.473
Pyroshan

04:33.555 --> 04:35.042
- Hello
- Hello Professor Yu

04:35.153 --> 04:37.274
- I've heard a lot
- I don't dare to take it

04:37.438 --> 04:40.939
I will introduce my two friends to you

04:42.576 --> 04:44.762
Coincidentally,
one has just left

04:50.655 --> 04:53.086
(Except he just left..)

04:53.396 --> 04:54.456
A barn

04:55.016 --> 04:56.236
Allow me

04:59.128 --> 05:01.762
He's someone I've talked to before

05:01.864 --> 05:04.362
Reporter Keng Shuyi introduced the currency

05:04.775 --> 05:06.325
Nice to meet you, reporter

05:08.975 --> 05:10.802
This beautiful woman...

05:11.076 --> 05:13.242
Piro Shan is the Xinjiang Network Entertainment Network

05:15.016 --> 05:17.162
Now the standard of journalists is very high

05:18.350 --> 05:19.350
Director

05:19.431 --> 05:22.042
Can you give me an opportunity to do a special interview ?

05:23.193 --> 05:24.732
I will give you an answer as soon as possible

05:40.608 --> 05:41.813
It's the same with the chicken

05:41.894 --> 05:44.522
As soon as I saw a beautiful woman, I started talking

05:44.816 --> 05:46.080
Shanshan is the same

05:46.185 --> 05:48.282
If you meet a handsome man, you talk too much

05:52.535 --> 05:54.316
Don't worry, I'll pick up the phone

05:56.655 --> 05:57.835
Hello mom

06:00.677 --> 06:02.082
I said

06:02.168 --> 06:04.562
I just came back and
wanted to settle down first

06:06.775 --> 06:09.486
Okay, okay,
I'll listen to mom, okay?

06:09.920 --> 06:12.082
Yes , I have hung up the phone

06:15.080 --> 06:16.937
We
have many things in common

06:17.018 --> 06:18.123
When I came to see you once

06:18.204 --> 06:20.719
My mom
was talking about introducing me to her partner's son

06:21.696 --> 06:25.322
My mother just said that
she will introduce me to her old friend's daughter

06:26.685 --> 06:29.802
Professor Yuyo
must go early to prepare for dinner tonight

06:29.962 --> 06:31.423
ok thank you

06:32.080 --> 06:34.412
- So I'm going to go first
- Go do it

06:34.493 --> 06:36.498
We rescheduled for the next interview

06:36.579 --> 06:37.579
Well done

06:56.759 --> 06:58.682
Still want to have dinner?

06:59.400 --> 07:02.162
I have to rewrite the article and
not be your friend anymore

07:17.895 --> 07:19.882
( Important development after being admitted to the group )

07:19.963 --> 07:22.242
(Proud to see)

07:34.327 --> 07:37.282
His voice is very good to listen to

07:37.640 --> 07:39.402
Soft and attractive

07:39.654 --> 07:42.685
People don't know whether they are good or bad

07:53.858 --> 07:57.202
(I can't hear him insisting)

08:07.585 --> 08:10.402
Seriously, I
never replied

08:11.680 --> 08:13.962
So, I just have to send the little ones

08:15.840 --> 08:18.224
(a mail came in today)

08:19.200 --> 08:22.271
("I'm honored to meet you")

08:27.407 --> 08:29.494
(I read a book today)

08:30.600 --> 08:34.082
(The title is "When I Met You,
I Wanted to Give Up")

08:35.775 --> 08:37.155
Not yet

08:39.520 --> 08:41.150
Let's have a drink

08:46.136 --> 08:47.555
Congratulations!

08:53.136 --> 08:54.722
Move this way

08:55.055 --> 08:56.356
Thank you

09:00.815 --> 09:02.402
It's a matter that can't be said enough

09:02.560 --> 09:04.802
It only worked because you and Bruce got along

09:04.976 --> 09:07.376
He gets excited by your plans and challenges

09:07.518 --> 09:09.122
That's why he stayed in Le Ann

09:15.529 --> 09:18.119
(a mail came in today)

09:18.720 --> 09:21.789
("I'm honored to meet you")

09:22.976 --> 09:25.525
(I read a book today)

09:26.277 --> 09:29.842
(The title is "When I Met You,
I Wanted to Give Up")

09:34.935 --> 09:36.195
What are you laughing at?

09:36.935 --> 09:38.926
You are not quite normal

09:39.400 --> 09:40.642
I haven't asked yet

09:40.723 --> 09:44.282
Why did you run away during the evening press conference ?

09:46.096 --> 09:48.682
I think it's because I'm an unreasonable person

09:56.008 --> 09:57.282
Anyway, you didn't read it

09:57.365 --> 09:59.075
So what does it matter what I send?

10:02.093 --> 10:04.972
(Tell me, why don't you reply to me)

10:05.760 --> 10:07.464
(No phone bill?)

10:07.560 --> 10:10.122
(Or busy with a multi-billion project?)

10:20.216 --> 10:21.882
I can't blame you for not replying

10:22.175 --> 10:24.284
You
can't type, but you can't read

10:31.815 --> 10:32.996
illiterate

10:33.575 --> 10:35.645
Because people who can't read can read?

10:37.736 --> 10:39.095
I haven't asked you yet

10:39.193 --> 10:41.362
Have you invited friends from the media yet?

10:42.001 --> 10:44.642
I introduced you in the evening, didn't I?

10:44.903 --> 10:47.539
It's a reporter named Keng Shuyi

10:48.653 --> 10:51.122
He is not your food partner

10:57.175 --> 10:58.519
We are just friends

10:58.600 --> 11:00.110
It's just convenient to mix and match

11:20.824 --> 11:22.202
Professor Yu

11:22.543 --> 11:23.922
Yes

11:53.985 --> 11:56.242
(Isn't that what unreasonable people are
all about?)

11:59.695 --> 12:00.922
gone

12:01.376 --> 12:02.836
He is really great

12:03.000 --> 12:04.722
He heard everything

12:52.125 --> 12:53.306
What are you looking at?

12:54.160 --> 12:56.082
I'm watching...

12:59.529 --> 13:02.562
Today's directorial debut
is a bit unusual

13:03.642 --> 13:05.882
At work, you are
quite different

13:11.136 --> 13:12.846
You are no different today

13:14.295 --> 13:15.682
With a different beauty

13:18.816 --> 13:21.162
The director is really
good at talking

13:23.935 --> 13:26.722
In front of the most beautiful reporter in town

13:27.638 --> 13:29.602
I can say this kind of words from my heart

13:37.078 --> 13:38.722
Today is not enough to be happy

13:39.749 --> 13:41.010
Let's go have a drink

13:42.280 --> 13:43.500
All right

13:56.295 --> 13:57.795
This is the place

14:01.256 --> 14:03.882
- Do you still remember
- Of course

14:04.639 --> 14:06.859
I knew right away
that we were the same type

14:30.936 --> 14:32.642
Hi beautiful woman

14:33.336 --> 14:34.395
are you alone

14:34.616 --> 14:36.282
Let's have a drink together

14:36.485 --> 14:37.505
I will claim

14:38.695 --> 14:40.482
Do you want to buy me alcohol?

14:41.894 --> 14:43.494
I don't drink ordinary alcohol

14:43.575 --> 14:46.095
This bottle is my special collection

14:46.307 --> 14:48.642
There are only three or four bottles in the world

14:49.553 --> 14:51.012
Ordinary people...

14:52.216 --> 14:53.846
I can't drink

15:01.093 --> 15:02.193
hello

15:03.410 --> 15:05.813
Give me a bottle of that

15:07.114 --> 15:09.399
- Hello, wait a minute
- just one thing

15:09.480 --> 15:11.235
How much is this drink?

15:11.415 --> 15:12.919
There are only three or four bottles in the world

15:13.000 --> 15:14.460
Because I won't be able to

15:14.932 --> 15:16.162
580

15:17.080 --> 15:18.482
So good

15:18.695 --> 15:22.002
There is no need to buy 580 tons of alcohol

15:25.256 --> 15:29.882
Finally, my value is
10 instead of 580

15:31.640 --> 15:32.962
58 only

16:11.616 --> 16:13.562
The memories with you

16:14.136 --> 16:16.122
It's so beautiful and so intoxicating

16:20.817 --> 16:22.962
You must be really drunk

17:15.752 --> 17:17.442
- Moaning
- Moaning

17:21.938 --> 17:23.122
Shuyi

17:23.384 --> 17:25.564
Yun Chum's annual strategic meeting
has been scheduled

17:25.575 --> 17:27.285
Did they send you an invitation?

17:35.976 --> 17:38.682
Unfortunately, it rained

17:40.520 --> 17:43.682
Today is the time to decide

17:43.878 --> 17:45.480
The invitation couldn't come so soon

17:45.576 --> 17:48.974
And Xian, the interview this time
was such a good response

17:49.109 --> 17:50.842
I will definitely send it to you

18:08.773 --> 18:10.882
(Shi Xian must still be angry)

18:11.406 --> 18:13.276
(There are only two magazines left this year)

18:13.415 --> 18:15.294
( Review of each company's year-end press conference)

18:15.375 --> 18:17.882
(Surely
it will be chosen as the cover by the end of the year)

18:18.510 --> 18:22.162
(No, he's happy, he's not happy,
I have to go to the dentist)

18:27.656 --> 18:29.285
Added Le Ann in this edit

18:29.366 --> 18:30.856
Director Chen has also been invited

18:31.004 --> 18:33.887
See
what else needs to be fixed

18:34.016 --> 18:35.019
There is no problem

18:35.100 --> 18:36.399
Plan accordingly

18:36.480 --> 18:37.619
all right

18:41.200 --> 18:43.039
(Director Xi will see you next week)

18:45.566 --> 18:46.665
Sun

18:47.460 --> 18:49.882
- Do you have plans with the media?
- Yes, Director Xi

18:49.967 --> 18:51.632
As usual, nothing is needed

18:51.799 --> 18:54.722
Added some new media...

18:55.775 --> 18:57.439
I
have approved the new media list

18:57.520 --> 18:58.922
Introducing money

19:04.855 --> 19:06.882
I will warn them again

19:15.071 --> 19:16.922
Min Yu Yunchum is the courier

19:18.055 --> 19:19.476
(have you arrived)

19:19.815 --> 19:21.455
(Looks like Shi Xian
doesn't have that kind of attitude yet)

19:21.659 --> 19:23.610
( I just don't want to admit that he's kind )

19:23.875 --> 19:25.115
(Then I'll forgive him)

19:25.271 --> 19:27.223
(If you go to the press conference,
thank you very much)

19:27.320 --> 19:28.802
(Then I will feed you with rice)

19:29.111 --> 19:31.212
A courier for sister Yuling Da

19:31.751 --> 19:33.042
For me?

19:33.335 --> 19:34.555
Thank you

19:47.419 --> 19:50.139
Pay attention, please gather information about Yu Yunchum

19:50.220 --> 19:51.867
Please send it to me as soon as possible

19:51.960 --> 19:53.139
Well done, Sister Yuling

19:54.560 --> 19:56.546
Now there are many things to do

19:57.800 --> 19:59.389
How did it happen?

20:00.216 --> 20:02.322
Editor's notes?

20:10.455 --> 20:12.804
(Uncle really does not disappoint me)

20:12.966 --> 20:16.002
(But isn't this drama
a bit too much?)

20:22.657 --> 20:24.603
Why didn't you come looking for me and say nothing?

20:28.575 --> 20:30.535
At first, the editor-in-chief and I were worried

20:30.719 --> 20:32.839
Now for Yun Chum and Kum Group's press conference

20:32.920 --> 20:34.761
You and Yuling
have to attend one match each

20:34.880 --> 20:36.429
In fact, it's easier now

20:37.744 --> 20:38.984
I'm bad

20:39.135 --> 20:40.635
I didn't handle it properly

20:42.069 --> 20:43.159
gone

20:43.240 --> 20:44.800
I have won the event

20:45.216 --> 20:46.669
What is the event?

20:47.030 --> 20:48.859
Isn't it just a press conference?

20:49.079 --> 20:50.989
You 've had a lot of cover stories this year

20:51.077 --> 20:52.626
You are doing very well

20:52.855 --> 20:55.295
Take advantage of this holiday and
have a good time

20:55.480 --> 20:57.071
Prepare for the next program

20:57.176 --> 20:58.845
I will fight again next year

20:58.953 --> 21:00.842
I wrote a special article about Yun Chum

21:00.942 --> 21:02.495
I must go to this press conference

21:02.664 --> 21:04.847
I would like to add this particular article to the digital magazine

21:04.960 --> 21:06.882
As an independent feature article

21:07.535 --> 21:10.295
Even if you can go and handle Shi Xian

21:10.476 --> 21:11.717
Digital magazine promotion

21:11.880 --> 21:13.802
It will take a long time

21:14.800 --> 21:16.220
I understand

21:16.896 --> 21:19.322
I can't change the editor-in-chief's mind
in one sitting

21:19.527 --> 21:21.247
So seize every opportunity

21:21.335 --> 21:23.285
Time is shrinking for long-term plans

21:24.016 --> 21:25.236
So try it

21:26.375 --> 21:28.765
Aw, if you go

21:29.055 --> 21:30.476
Don't forget to take Xiao Yu

21:31.496 --> 21:32.576
I have to take him

21:33.583 --> 21:36.648
I'm not even sure if I can get in.
How should I take him?

21:38.999 --> 21:42.308
Is there still a place you can't enter ?

21:44.760 --> 21:48.200
Did you find someone else to teach Sister Yi Qin Xiyu ?

21:48.281 --> 21:49.802
I can't teach him enough

21:49.953 --> 21:51.793
The second generation of rich people like Xiu

21:51.874 --> 21:54.700
Why come to work in such a harsh environment?

21:54.781 --> 21:58.046
Isn't it better if you stay at home or do what you like?

22:00.055 --> 22:02.366
Don't you think Xiao Yu has a pure heart
?

22:04.201 --> 22:06.871
Not only is he pure of heart, but
his way of thinking is different

22:07.800 --> 22:09.842
Sister, I really can't teach him

22:12.855 --> 22:14.762
Is it bad to be pure in mind?

22:14.840 --> 22:16.750
Or like a smart person ?

22:17.815 --> 22:19.605
Be a good person before doing anything else

22:19.696 --> 22:22.002
It is true that Xiao Yu
has many weaknesses

22:22.135 --> 22:24.882
But I believe I
can train him

22:25.135 --> 22:26.616
You have to believe me

22:26.696 --> 22:29.002
Take good care of him
and guide him

22:29.256 --> 22:31.082
Think of it as helping me

22:45.135 --> 22:46.135
Shi Yue

22:46.579 --> 22:48.271
Yun Chum is going to hold a press conference

22:48.352 --> 22:49.454
See related information

22:49.535 --> 22:51.044
I will go with you that day

22:53.095 --> 22:56.638
Sister Shuyi doesn't have an invitation?

22:57.815 --> 22:59.646
You don't have to worry about that

23:00.575 --> 23:03.255
But the audio file that my sister Shuyi asked me to make has not been completed yet

23:03.335 --> 23:05.420
I asked you to
make an interview audio file before

23:05.501 --> 23:07.756
To become familiar with the nature of work

23:07.837 --> 23:09.442
To better understand this field

23:09.579 --> 23:11.402
Min Yu Yun Chum is
leading the field this year

23:11.483 --> 23:14.322
All journalists in this field
want to go to this press conference

23:14.541 --> 23:17.502
Xian has a clear idea and
understands the market very well

23:17.529 --> 23:19.811
You've only listened to Xi'an audio files before

23:19.892 --> 23:22.322
This time I witnessed his attractiveness

23:31.815 --> 23:34.245
The editor is really biased

23:35.370 --> 23:37.482
The editor
must have wanted to hurt him

23:38.038 --> 23:40.897
But the right given by the editor and
the right given by Shi Xian

23:41.480 --> 23:43.002
Is it the same depth?

23:44.736 --> 23:45.916
Do it quickly

24:30.341 --> 24:31.401
Yuyo

24:31.594 --> 24:33.562
Your phone is ringing,
someone is looking for you

24:50.930 --> 24:52.199
Xian

24:52.280 --> 24:55.040
Do you still have media invitations for the Yung Chum press conference ?

24:55.878 --> 24:56.898
Why?

24:57.496 --> 24:59.082
Just a reporter?

24:59.224 --> 25:00.894
Yes, how do you know?

25:02.775 --> 25:04.966
Aye, when I came back,
only these reporters knew

25:06.055 --> 25:08.275
You worked so hard
to find him an invitation

25:08.471 --> 25:10.671
Are you trying to follow him?

25:10.767 --> 25:12.242
Or is he chasing you?

25:14.256 --> 25:16.315
No, we are friends

25:16.424 --> 25:18.224
Same hometown, same school

25:18.337 --> 25:19.485
It's convenient to say

25:19.566 --> 25:20.665
And then...

25:21.335 --> 25:23.775
It's supposed to be the older brother taking care of the younger sister, right?

25:23.855 --> 25:25.136
Do you treat everyone like you?

25:25.216 --> 25:27.559
I like to protect the weak and be a flower guard

25:30.055 --> 25:31.055
How do I remember...

25:31.135 --> 25:33.960
That reporter
interviewed you recently, didn't he?

25:35.720 --> 25:37.389
You didn't invite him?

25:41.736 --> 25:43.082
So is there anything else?

25:44.960 --> 25:45.980
There isn't

25:51.637 --> 25:53.882
If you can beat me, maybe there is

25:56.921 --> 25:58.271
Worked all day

25:58.368 --> 26:00.482
Everyone
came here to relax

26:00.656 --> 26:03.206
Unexpectedly, we
came here and became sandbags

26:03.440 --> 26:04.621
I will tell you

26:04.702 --> 26:07.472
Why is there such a strong desire to win even after finishing work?

26:16.408 --> 26:17.762
Do it

26:23.629 --> 26:26.099
It's not enough of a Xi'an problem

26:26.638 --> 26:27.959
The boss of this big company...

26:28.055 --> 26:31.042
I wouldn't care about media invitations

26:31.520 --> 26:32.939
Must be a misunderstanding

26:34.942 --> 26:36.202
It's useless to think

26:36.896 --> 26:38.495
Just call him

26:38.575 --> 26:39.922
I will ask

26:40.126 --> 26:43.162
If there is a misunderstanding,
I will ask for an invitation

26:43.420 --> 26:44.861
If you are still upset

26:45.059 --> 26:47.289
I will apologize and coax him

26:55.975 --> 26:57.054
(I'm sorry)

26:57.205 --> 26:58.682
(lost to Shi Xian in the competition)

26:58.775 --> 27:01.366
(I can't help you get an invitation anymore)

27:01.615 --> 27:03.285
Is it really him?

27:06.495 --> 27:07.755
(Shanshan)

27:08.520 --> 27:11.109
(I'm really gone this time)

27:14.535 --> 27:16.896
(Min Yu Yun Chum
Annual Strategy Conference to be held in two days)

27:17.038 --> 27:19.907
(Xi Xiang
sent an invitation to Tamin Xue Yuling)

27:20.023 --> 27:23.122
(Xi Xiang himself..
did it deliberately)

27:24.496 --> 27:27.402
(and didn't send me an invite)

27:28.896 --> 27:30.576
(Xian heard)

27:30.663 --> 27:32.852
(I'm angry and holding a grudge)

27:35.456 --> 27:37.362
(Did you say this?)

27:40.800 --> 27:42.562
(Are you making me angry on purpose?)

27:42.640 --> 27:44.140
(strong, jealous, hateful)

27:45.878 --> 27:46.919
(do not worry)

27:47.040 --> 27:49.873
(I will ask my friend
if he can get a copy for you)

27:51.696 --> 27:53.535
(Good, thank you Shanshan)

27:53.633 --> 27:55.322
(You are the Lord of my life)

27:56.055 --> 27:57.442
(I can't, I can't)

27:57.640 --> 27:59.061
(I can't beat him)

28:01.437 --> 28:02.986
can't win

28:12.040 --> 28:14.682
There is no way, my friend

28:14.824 --> 28:17.402
Shi Xian is still very opinionated

28:18.000 --> 28:19.220
That said

28:20.390 --> 28:23.642
I 'm going
to stick with you

28:24.161 --> 28:25.679
If only he wasn't so opinionated

28:25.760 --> 28:27.541
Do I need to sneak in like this?

28:27.996 --> 28:29.204
I said

28:29.293 --> 28:30.802
He cares about you

28:30.883 --> 28:33.042
If not, why
make it difficult for you?

28:34.200 --> 28:36.802
He won't give it to me, so I'll go to the dentist

29:03.000 --> 29:04.722
Dare to bet and lose

29:06.815 --> 29:08.714
But I think it's good to spare a little

29:09.280 --> 29:11.080
The reporter is
a very good reporter

29:11.176 --> 29:13.042
His articles are very insightful

29:13.527 --> 29:15.356
I couldn't help him this time

29:15.496 --> 29:16.839
I just hope he doesn't scold me

29:16.920 --> 29:18.380
Let it be you

29:36.197 --> 29:37.218
hello

29:37.855 --> 29:40.493
Have you distributed the invitations for the press conference ?

29:40.626 --> 29:44.378
(Yes, Director Xi
has gone to the media since this morning)

29:48.095 --> 29:49.765
(Hello Director Xi)

29:50.256 --> 29:53.775
(Introduction of money and Zhang Chen TV
is back)

29:53.960 --> 29:55.180
(will go up)

30:03.375 --> 30:04.922
It's not a misunderstanding

30:05.148 --> 30:07.708
So I had to go and
ask him face to face

30:30.335 --> 30:32.402
Why are you
screaming like a ghost in the middle of the night?

30:36.312 --> 30:37.631
My daughter still screamed

30:37.712 --> 30:39.376
Only Uncle
is sitting here in the middle of the night without turning on the light

30:39.457 --> 30:41.017
The younger one is more like a ghost

30:42.367 --> 30:46.307
Did you know that you are going to deliver your only niece?

30:46.750 --> 30:49.260
I'm sick, I'm sick

30:49.880 --> 30:51.682
Everything is normal and
you are not scared

30:51.872 --> 30:53.212
I quickly went back to sleep

31:01.343 --> 31:03.694
What's going on, Uncle?

31:05.496 --> 31:07.006
It's not a breakup

31:09.298 --> 31:11.165
Or don't you even get a chance to love ?

31:11.248 --> 31:12.918
That woman from the other time?

31:14.176 --> 31:17.126
It's not that U Young likes to crush others and
others don't like him back

31:20.335 --> 31:21.516
Qin Shi Yue

31:21.696 --> 31:23.206
I'll say it again

31:23.366 --> 31:24.626
I went back to sleep

31:25.671 --> 31:26.842
Well done, young man

31:26.920 --> 31:28.220
Good night uncle

31:54.727 --> 31:55.896
- Yes
- Hello

31:55.976 --> 31:57.236
I will take you to the hall

31:57.317 --> 31:58.857
- Good, thank you
- This side

32:06.736 --> 32:09.002
Sit in this chair

32:09.951 --> 32:11.562
Are you ahead of the curve?

32:11.976 --> 32:14.122
A financial introduction is a very important
media partner

32:14.271 --> 32:17.002
The CEO specifically instructed to give you the front seat

32:17.855 --> 32:19.676
- Sit down
- Thank you

(Min Yu Yun Chum Annual Strategy Conference)

32:36.967 --> 32:39.127
(Today's seat is not bad)

32:47.040 --> 32:49.242
Do you want to go to Director Xi's lounge first?

32:49.388 --> 32:50.448
No need

33:12.766 --> 33:14.522
Has director Xi arrived?

33:14.733 --> 33:17.695
We
put some important media in the front row

improve your professional skills

- Hello
- Don't worry

33:50.954 --> 33:52.958
Just now, my colleague
called me at the wrong place

33:53.039 --> 33:54.239
Please forgive me

33:54.320 --> 33:55.520
Come with me

33:59.800 --> 34:00.820
Go up

36:11.015 --> 36:13.402
You guys come in quickly,
I've thought of a way

36:15.480 --> 36:17.595
So hurry up and let's go

will wait outside

36:25.575 --> 36:27.175
(He's coming to me)

36:27.255 --> 36:29.366
(He must have just come out to find me
)

quickly

37:37.856 --> 37:40.242
Is Xu Yuling
better at interviewing than me?

37:40.327 --> 37:42.178
Or is it because his handwriting
is better than mine?

Thank you Assistant Chan

Don't worry, reporter

This seat is
specially arranged for you, Director Xi

38:20.239 --> 38:21.759

made a mistake

Forgive me

have a request

say

38:32.055 --> 38:33.242
I
still have two colleagues

38:33.392 --> 38:35.993
Can you arrange for us to sit together ?

38:36.120 --> 38:37.259
It's okay

38:50.372 --> 38:53.922
How did
you come in?

38:54.600 --> 38:56.002
He arranged

38:58.394 --> 39:00.842
So you must thank him well

(okay)

What is this? Are you prepared for anything?

39:57.577 --> 39:58.958
That's his style
