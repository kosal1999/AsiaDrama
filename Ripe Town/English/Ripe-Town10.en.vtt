00:43.079 --> 00:45.039
Chungya, are you able to speak now?

00:46.039 --> 00:47.439
I could originally say

00:50.479 --> 00:51.119
Chungya

00:51.119 --> 00:52.000
What did you say just now?

00:52.439 --> 00:53.840
You said you ordered me to be killed?

00:54.079 --> 00:54.759
Yes

00:55.439 --> 00:56.280
why?

00:56.840 --> 00:57.920
Maybe I hold a grudge

00:57.920 --> 00:59.000
Are you doing this out of fear of revenge?

01:00.039 --> 01:01.399
I am just a servant

01:01.479 --> 01:02.439
What on earth can you do?

01:03.159 --> 01:03.799
For you, killing people is

01:03.799 --> 01:05.000
Is it that easy?

01:06.079 --> 01:06.920
This is...

01:08.920 --> 01:10.319
This is what we do.

01:11.920 --> 01:12.840
What do you mean?

01:15.799 --> 01:16.920
In a robbery

01:19.040 --> 01:20.239
It's murder

01:20.439 --> 01:22.200
No one can survive our hands

01:22.799 --> 01:24.519
We gathered together with about 40 brothers.

01:24.760 --> 01:26.120
Often on this floor

01:27.040 --> 01:28.079
It's called a killer crocodile.

01:28.079 --> 01:30.060
(Old name for Holyul Crocodile)

01:39.959 --> 01:42.400
Kill it!

01:42.719 --> 01:44.920
Kill it!

01:45.159 --> 01:46.519
Just hearing the term Gangnam murderous crocodile

01:47.040 --> 01:49.560
I was so confused that I ran away and
was able to get a large sum of money.

01:49.920 --> 01:52.719
The six-atomic bomb does not leave behind intact corpses.

01:53.200 --> 01:56.000
They said we should turn the dead into wandering ghosts.

01:56.159 --> 01:57.280
So they extort money

01:59.799 --> 02:01.879
Did you become rich in Duhyeon?

02:02.120 --> 02:04.640
the last thing we did

02:05.760 --> 02:08.159
It's a government office that returned home.

02:09.080 --> 02:09.840
From that official at that time

02:09.840 --> 02:11.240
200,000 nyang of silver money

02:11.240 --> 02:13.479
I stole five boxes of gold

02:16.599 --> 02:17.199
Hey, dumbass.

02:18.599 --> 02:19.639
to you

02:20.400 --> 02:22.639
I will give you all five boxes of gold.

02:22.960 --> 02:23.719
How do you feel?

02:24.439 --> 02:26.360
(Others say they don't like it)

02:28.159 --> 02:28.960
Hey, dumbass.

02:29.360 --> 02:31.400
There are over 10 jars of alcohol in there.

02:31.400 --> 02:32.439
You can drink it right now

02:32.759 --> 02:33.879
among our children

02:33.879 --> 02:34.960
You're the only one who doesn't drink, right?

02:35.319 --> 02:35.919
Let's do what we always do

02:36.840 --> 02:38.840
Did you really kill all of your brothers?

02:40.199 --> 02:41.120
that day

02:42.960 --> 02:45.199
let people get drunk

02:45.719 --> 02:47.639
I cut off their heads one by one

02:49.319 --> 02:51.319
In fact, the method for the six atomic bombs was

02:51.319 --> 02:52.400
It's the most thorough way

02:53.159 --> 02:54.639
Unfortunately, I made a mistake in the middle.

02:54.639 --> 02:55.800
Even if someone wakes up

02:56.400 --> 02:57.759
It has nothing to do with me

02:58.879 --> 03:00.520
Because I'm dumb

03:00.719 --> 03:02.400
I can't call someone's name

03:03.360 --> 03:05.479
The six atomic bombs were carried out by mobilizing people.

03:05.800 --> 03:06.800
enough to kill me

03:21.400 --> 03:22.039
Hey, dumbass.

03:23.120 --> 03:23.879
Very good job

03:25.199 --> 03:29.719
What if you get drunk too?

03:31.520 --> 03:32.759
Those guys

03:33.520 --> 03:35.199
How much do I have to drink first?

03:35.199 --> 03:36.680
'Cause they can get it all

03:37.919 --> 03:42.639
(What if I kill you too
?)

03:51.599 --> 03:52.719
you can never do that

03:56.199 --> 03:57.000
(why?)

03:59.000 --> 03:59.879
Because I'm dumb

04:00.120 --> 04:01.120
Besides, alone

04:01.840 --> 04:03.319
So many gold and silver treasures

04:03.719 --> 04:04.759
What can you use it for?

04:08.400 --> 04:11.120
Even though the six atomic bombs don’t know that I’m not dumb .

04:11.759 --> 04:12.840
Still got one thing right

04:13.520 --> 04:15.039
Because I live alone

04:15.039 --> 04:16.560
I didn't know what to do.

04:17.560 --> 04:19.600
So,
have you been pretending to be mute on purpose all this time?

04:20.839 --> 04:22.519
After being mistreated by my stepmother

04:22.959 --> 04:24.439
I became so dumb

04:25.439 --> 04:26.519
After not being able to talk for so many years

04:27.199 --> 04:28.680
At some point, I started speaking.

04:29.920 --> 04:31.240
But when I thought about it

04:32.240 --> 04:33.519
It's not bad to live dumb

04:34.399 --> 04:35.959
Others are not wary of you

04:35.959 --> 04:37.720
You say everything in front of me

04:38.279 --> 04:40.000
They even took pity on me

04:40.439 --> 04:41.600
So at all

04:41.920 --> 04:43.199
I decided to live like a mute

04:43.600 --> 04:45.639
Damn it I was dumb

04:45.639 --> 04:48.680
Otherwise, the six atomic bombs
would never have left me alive.

04:51.120 --> 04:52.040
Then why do you

04:55.079 --> 04:57.000
I think I know if they're trying to kill me

04:57.279 --> 04:58.279
While holding a knife

04:59.279 --> 05:00.399
I'm trying to nip it in the bud.

05:02.680 --> 05:03.319
Chungya

05:05.399 --> 05:06.879
6 years ago that winter

05:06.959 --> 05:08.800
If Chungya
hadn't taken me to the Yu family,

05:08.800 --> 05:10.079
I would already be dead

05:10.720 --> 05:12.680
Since you ordered me to be killed

05:12.800 --> 05:13.879
If you don't kill me

05:14.800 --> 05:16.279
Chungya becomes dangerous

05:17.920 --> 05:19.800
My life belongs to Chungya anyway.

05:21.959 --> 05:23.040
Even if you kill me right now

05:23.800 --> 05:25.160
I have nothing to say

05:37.897 --> 05:42.320
(Doohyeon government office)

06:30.685 --> 06:33.965
=Prosperous Underground=
=Episode 10=

06:40.600 --> 06:43.279
The six-atomic bomb kills everyone, but

06:44.319 --> 06:45.399
I am not a six-won bomb

06:47.120 --> 06:48.399
I'm different from him

06:52.360 --> 06:53.720
Even if I die

06:54.279 --> 06:55.879
I will never kill you

06:59.199 --> 07:00.279
You're not going to kill me?

07:01.240 --> 07:03.040
Do you really think I'm going to kill you?

07:07.480 --> 07:08.399
no

07:09.240 --> 07:10.920
I believe that Chungya will not kill me.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.639
But what does Nari plan to do?

07:16.680 --> 07:17.680
As soon as I got here

07:18.800 --> 07:20.040
I met a lot of peasants.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.040
If I kill you right away

07:23.120 --> 07:24.319
in a rural town

07:25.319 --> 07:26.360
I feel like there will only be ugly rumors for no reason.

07:26.920 --> 07:28.680
I'd rather take you

07:28.759 --> 07:30.000
If you keep it next to you, it might actually kill you.

07:30.399 --> 07:31.720
I plan to say that there are many.

07:35.040 --> 07:37.279
Then I
can never escape death.

07:40.560 --> 07:41.519
That's right

07:42.279 --> 07:43.560
You never know who will die first

07:46.720 --> 07:47.720
Is it difficult to kill a six-atomic bomb?

07:50.120 --> 07:50.800
it is not diffcult

07:52.240 --> 07:53.160
The difficult thing is

07:54.000 --> 07:55.560
Killing a person without swinging a sword

07:56.800 --> 07:58.519
You can commit robbery and not be judged.

07:59.120 --> 08:00.879
Killing a person without swinging a sword

08:02.000 --> 08:03.800
You can commit robbery and not be judged.

08:06.120 --> 08:07.480
Kill the six atomic bombs

08:08.120 --> 08:09.680
Don't let anyone suspect

08:10.879 --> 08:11.560
next

08:12.439 --> 08:13.560
You, Bae Dong-in, study writing

08:14.600 --> 08:16.600
As adopted son of Yuk Won Bomb

08:17.399 --> 08:19.199
I'm inheriting the Yuk family's wealth.

08:21.439 --> 08:22.879
What can I do with that?

08:24.639 --> 08:26.720
Does Chungya have a plan?

08:28.879 --> 08:29.759
I don't have a plan

08:33.759 --> 08:35.080
you have

08:41.879 --> 08:42.559
Chungya

08:43.320 --> 08:44.440
I wonder if I will find a way

08:44.440 --> 08:46.159
I don't know either

08:47.320 --> 08:48.600
But you make us

08:48.600 --> 08:49.879
The ideal that drove me to the edge of a cliff

08:51.080 --> 08:52.960
One of them has to die to end.

08:57.159 --> 08:59.039
If we are lucky and succeed

09:03.320 --> 09:04.039
I like Chungya

09:04.519 --> 09:06.360
I will treat you as my father.

09:09.840 --> 09:10.759
father

09:11.919 --> 09:13.080
please accept me

09:20.171 --> 09:23.554
(Mr. Yuk’s Mansion)

09:29.120 --> 09:30.000
You came

09:33.159 --> 09:33.759
please

09:34.279 --> 09:34.840
Let's go in

09:52.799 --> 09:54.080
at my house

09:54.360 --> 09:56.320
It was somewhere like this...

09:56.919 --> 09:58.200
How can you live in a place like this?

10:02.399 --> 10:03.279
I can buy it

10:05.039 --> 10:06.120
Not only can I live

10:09.159 --> 10:10.399
You can also drink celebratory wine.

10:24.879 --> 10:26.279
I have something to say

10:29.399 --> 10:30.759
Kill that six-atomic bomb

10:32.120 --> 10:33.559
I plan to share my wealth with you.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.399
No... Master

10:39.159 --> 10:41.000
Are you kidding me?

10:43.840 --> 10:44.799
I mean

10:47.399 --> 10:49.720
I can't fight as well as Jang Gui or Ryu.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.759
Because I'm not as smart as you,

10:56.919 --> 10:59.080
There's nothing I know how to do

11:01.399 --> 11:02.360
That's right

11:06.039 --> 11:08.120
I don't even have the courage to kill

11:17.440 --> 11:18.279
At least

11:19.440 --> 11:20.399
The guy called me

11:22.639 --> 11:24.200
He is a man of loyalty.

11:26.159 --> 11:27.080
Master today

11:27.840 --> 11:29.639
Since I said that

11:30.720 --> 11:32.919
Master also believes in me

11:33.639 --> 11:35.000
It means you look at me favorably

11:36.919 --> 11:37.960
I am

11:39.320 --> 11:41.720
I sacrificed my whole life

11:43.279 --> 11:45.240
I will assist you, Master.

11:49.039 --> 11:49.840
good night

11:53.039 --> 11:55.639
You have a deep connection with our brother-in-law.

11:57.080 --> 11:59.360
We also think the same way about the death penalty.

12:02.000 --> 12:02.639
good night

12:03.320 --> 12:04.440
If it's false

12:05.720 --> 12:06.399
Janggwiya

12:07.039 --> 12:07.840
bring a knife

12:08.080 --> 12:08.720
what are you doing?

12:09.120 --> 12:09.759
bring it

12:23.600 --> 12:24.360
Now it's your turn

12:32.519 --> 12:33.600
Drink it

Jinyukja

13:21.480 --> 13:22.399
Just leave now

13:32.279 --> 13:33.600
What's going on here?

13:33.960 --> 13:35.720
Please make my dream come true

13:36.679 --> 13:37.399
Is it a dream?

13:40.279 --> 13:41.759
i don't know how to do that

13:45.759 --> 13:47.519
You can

13:48.000 --> 13:49.480
These days, I keep

13:49.480 --> 13:50.919
I dream of taking your class

13:51.840 --> 13:53.320
I have a young student who is taking class with me.

13:54.440 --> 13:55.840
They say the disciple's name was Gyo Gaedong.

13:58.639 --> 14:00.600
Gaeddong comes to me after class.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.480
Because he lost his head

14:04.200 --> 14:05.639
He asked me to find his lost head.

14:17.080 --> 14:18.000
Master

14:21.039 --> 14:23.080
If you killed Gyogaeddong, you killed him.

14:24.159 --> 14:26.399
How do you cut off a dog's head?

14:26.399 --> 14:27.960
Can I bury it in my yard?

14:30.039 --> 14:31.519
This has been happening in Duhyeon for quite some time.

14:31.519 --> 14:32.960
It's a story that has been passed down.

14:33.759 --> 14:35.440
The people here call it Wangsungni.

14:35.440 --> 14:37.120
I'm sure you remember it very well.

14:37.759 --> 14:39.080
Just by listening

14:39.080 --> 14:40.960
It’s a name that makes my teeth tremble

14:42.559 --> 14:43.519
But it's a pity

14:44.480 --> 14:46.480
Master, you
will never live until then.

14:47.480 --> 14:50.200
At best, he
will be imprisoned and then beheaded.

14:50.879 --> 14:52.120
But do you know what?

14:52.559 --> 14:54.320
A criminal like you is

14:54.559 --> 14:56.840
It won't be easy even in prison.

14:57.799 --> 14:59.639
Getting beaten and scolded is basic.

15:00.799 --> 15:03.000
Those prisoners

15:03.519 --> 15:05.720
On the criminal's body

15:05.720 --> 15:07.159
They say they also spray poop and urine.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.399
To the point where I think it would be better to die

15:08.399 --> 15:10.039
It will be very painful

15:12.639 --> 15:13.440
of course

15:15.120 --> 15:16.519
Before going to the guillotine

15:17.039 --> 15:18.480
You'll be dragged down the street

15:19.639 --> 15:21.320
Otherwise, everyone will come to see it.

15:25.200 --> 15:27.360
Of course, Master's friends and acquaintances

15:30.879 --> 15:33.120
All of Master's disciples will come too.

15:36.039 --> 15:37.720
They really want you

15:39.320 --> 15:40.960
Shall we see him as a teacher?

15:42.519 --> 15:43.840
Or should we see it as a beast?

15:44.399 --> 15:46.200
After cutting the head, the body rots within 3 days.

15:46.399 --> 15:48.039
It will become food for stray dogs.

15:53.360 --> 15:54.000

Gyogaeddong

15:58.559 --> 16:00.039
I'm waiting in Gucheon

16:04.799 --> 16:05.399
I am...

16:06.080 --> 16:08.879
I didn't kill Gaeddong on purpose.

16:10.240 --> 16:11.559
It was an accidental murder

16:13.159 --> 16:15.960
It's accidental

16:20.039 --> 16:20.799
It means accidental

16:24.600 --> 16:26.279
Master's copper scale marks

16:26.279 --> 16:28.679
It was imprinted on Gyogaedtong’s bones.

16:29.679 --> 16:31.200
Is it still accidental murder?

16:32.519 --> 16:33.519
Who really believes that?

16:33.759 --> 16:34.440
that day

16:36.559 --> 16:38.200
after class

16:40.320 --> 16:44.159
Gyogaeddong came back secretly.

16:44.759 --> 16:45.320
that is...

16:47.240 --> 16:47.799
Gaeddong

16:48.679 --> 16:51.519
You stole one of my brushes

16:54.039 --> 16:55.960
We promised to meet and play together

16:57.919 --> 16:59.960
He said he would teach me how to write from that day on.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.399
He said he would bring a brush too.

17:07.079 --> 17:08.559
You stole one of your teacher's brushes?

17:09.799 --> 17:11.279
I truly committed a deadly sin.

17:11.279 --> 17:12.039
no, no

17:12.119 --> 17:15.640
I just hit Gaetdong with a trick.

17:15.640 --> 17:16.799
Stealing things?

17:17.079 --> 17:18.200
How dare you steal something?

17:18.480 --> 17:19.160
Master

17:19.440 --> 17:21.519
Try hitting it to your heart's content.

17:22.119 --> 17:22.759
After hitting everything

17:23.000 --> 17:24.440
Then you have to give me the brush.

17:24.440 --> 17:25.160
How is it?

17:25.319 --> 17:26.440
What a mean thing!

17:27.079 --> 17:29.720
Such a shameless guy

17:29.720 --> 17:32.359
That's what it's like to be a child without parents

17:34.039 --> 17:34.960
What did you say just now?

17:36.599 --> 17:38.799
I said he was a shameless guy.

17:39.119 --> 17:41.119
You dirty and shameful bastard

17:41.119 --> 17:43.759
A person who grew up without parents...

17:45.240 --> 17:47.119
Did you tell Gaeddong that he grew up without parents ?

17:48.759 --> 17:49.400
okay

17:51.799 --> 17:54.000
However, Gyo Gaeddong
grew up without a mother from a young age.

17:57.799 --> 17:59.759
How dare you...

18:10.200 --> 18:11.559
Such a mean thing

18:18.920 --> 18:19.640
But the dog's head is

18:19.640 --> 18:21.839
Why did you cut it?

18:24.279 --> 18:26.319
I wasn't in my right mind back then either.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.200
(As the day gets dark)

18:29.839 --> 18:31.640
(I have a body)

18:32.200 --> 18:34.039
(moving out of the room)

18:35.920 --> 18:39.079
(Perhaps people are tricked)

18:39.680 --> 18:41.799
(I'm afraid that people will notice it's a wound)

18:42.279 --> 18:43.440
(stop...)

18:50.640 --> 18:51.359
In the end I

18:52.720 --> 18:54.400
headless corpse

18:54.400 --> 18:56.319
I hid it behind the stage

18:57.160 --> 18:59.079
Was the head buried in the yard?

18:59.240 --> 19:00.079
after that

19:02.039 --> 19:03.920
Gaeddong every night

19:03.920 --> 19:05.680
came to see me

19:24.640 --> 19:27.720
Master, hit me more.

19:29.519 --> 19:30.319
(But after that)

19:31.079 --> 19:33.039
(I couldn't sleep well)

19:33.279 --> 19:34.599
(Just close your eyes)

19:34.599 --> 19:35.480
Master

19:35.480 --> 19:37.079
(Because Gyogaeddong has come)

19:37.079 --> 19:37.920
Master

19:39.480 --> 19:41.839
You should take back the whip that hit me.

19:41.839 --> 19:42.480
okay

19:44.039 --> 19:44.880
Don't do that

19:46.359 --> 19:47.359
look at this

19:47.839 --> 19:48.400
no...

19:57.039 --> 19:58.319
Today I

19:58.720 --> 19:59.359
Already here...

20:01.079 --> 20:04.119
I got hit over a hundred times.

20:04.839 --> 20:05.480
It's not possible

20:06.240 --> 20:06.720
If not...

20:09.039 --> 20:09.640
I...

20:11.839 --> 20:13.359
Don't hit me more

20:20.000 --> 20:21.519
It is invalid to hit the teacher alone.

20:21.720 --> 20:22.440
It's invalid.

20:23.000 --> 20:29.519
It is invalid to hit the teacher alone.

20:29.799 --> 20:39.359
It is invalid to hit the teacher alone.

21:00.559 --> 21:02.960
Hitting someone alone is invalid.

21:07.119 --> 21:07.960
Master

21:08.799 --> 21:11.720
Should I report it to the government office?
Or would Master embroider it himself?

21:15.880 --> 21:16.559
Yukjikah

21:16.920 --> 21:17.720
please please

21:17.720 --> 21:19.200
Please save me

21:19.240 --> 21:20.160
Meantime

21:20.359 --> 21:22.319
I was also very distressed.

21:22.319 --> 21:23.799
Yukjik, please, please.

21:23.799 --> 21:25.440
please forgive me

21:25.759 --> 21:26.960
Yukjik, please, please.

21:31.440 --> 21:32.880
Forgiveness should be bestowed upon Gae Ddong.

21:34.960 --> 21:35.599
If not, I

21:37.079 --> 21:39.119
What should I do?

21:41.640 --> 21:43.519
To admit guilt

21:44.720 --> 21:46.640
What Master did

21:46.759 --> 21:49.960
Write it all down without a single lie

21:50.359 --> 21:52.359
After signing with a thumbprint

21:52.680 --> 21:54.440
Burn it in front of the dog poop's grave.

21:57.920 --> 22:00.640
I guess I should also report it to the government office.

22:00.680 --> 22:01.200
no

22:01.680 --> 22:03.440
Don't write a memorial service

22:05.359 --> 22:06.119
I will write a memorial service.

22:12.380 --> 22:13.794
(Muryujae)

22:21.559 --> 22:23.279
No... where is the grave?

22:27.559 --> 22:28.599
Before that, let me take a look.

22:33.039 --> 22:33.880
No, no, no.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.359
okay

22:38.279 --> 22:39.279
Look

22:40.200 --> 22:41.160
Look

23:00.240 --> 23:01.680
No, you...

23:01.680 --> 23:02.440
Master

23:04.160 --> 23:05.519
We'll give you a ride instead.

23:06.920 --> 23:09.039
No, what on earth are you trying to do?

23:09.359 --> 23:10.200
Master

23:12.279 --> 23:13.799
I changed my mind, I'm not reporting it.

23:14.200 --> 23:17.400
So, am I doing you
a favor?

23:19.039 --> 23:20.119
yes

23:21.599 --> 23:23.920
You are my benefactor

23:25.680 --> 23:26.440
If so, I would like to ask you a small favor.

23:26.440 --> 23:28.440
Would you please listen?

23:41.359 --> 23:43.960
You were trying to trap me from the beginning.

23:58.279 --> 23:58.920
long ear

24:00.799 --> 24:02.400
Please speak well to your teacher.

24:08.480 --> 24:09.400
Mr. Wang

24:11.039 --> 24:11.799
Thank you for your hard work

24:16.319 --> 24:19.039
Now, is Rep. Jeong next?

24:22.000 --> 24:23.119
Yes, that's right.

24:24.359 --> 24:25.720
Rep. Jeong

24:26.200 --> 24:28.240
It won't be easy like Mr. Wang

24:29.559 --> 24:31.039
He is a very famous person

24:31.960 --> 24:33.559
The county governor also
showed his illness to Rep. Jeong, didn’t he?

24:34.799 --> 24:35.559
furthermore

24:36.000 --> 24:37.640
I just stole a few antiques.

24:38.119 --> 24:39.119
ask for sin

24:39.119 --> 24:41.279
Making them listen to us obediently

24:41.279 --> 24:42.680
It won't be easy

24:42.920 --> 24:43.519
yes

24:43.759 --> 24:45.559
It was already a pain in the ass

24:45.559 --> 24:47.119
Unexpectedly, King Jin

24:47.119 --> 24:48.599
They've already prepared everything.

24:49.599 --> 24:50.279
King Jin?

24:50.839 --> 24:52.599
What did he do?

24:53.000 --> 24:53.640
In the beginning

24:53.640 --> 24:55.000
Because King Jin had a gambling debt,

24:55.000 --> 24:56.200
Debtors came to visit me

24:56.400 --> 24:57.640
I paid it back at that time.

24:58.440 --> 24:59.599
Then a few days later

24:59.599 --> 25:00.960
Just then, Rep. Jeong came by.

25:02.200 --> 25:03.160
I suddenly have a thought

25:05.319 --> 25:07.079
The fact that Rep. Jeong stole something

25:07.079 --> 25:08.039
Let King Jin know

25:08.599 --> 25:10.319
Lost and found documents

25:10.319 --> 25:11.079
I gave it to King Jin.

25:11.799 --> 25:12.880
Actually, King Jin

25:13.079 --> 25:16.279
By slandering Rep. Jeong,

25:16.279 --> 25:17.359
I was thinking of taking money from you at this point...

25:17.759 --> 25:19.000
Such a foolish guy

25:19.799 --> 25:20.599
That's right

25:21.279 --> 25:22.680
I stole it, but you can't let me see it.

25:24.160 --> 25:25.200
But King Jin, he

25:25.880 --> 25:27.880
He was worse than me.

25:28.519 --> 25:29.400
Is it evil?

25:29.920 --> 25:31.200
Are you asking for more money?

25:31.200 --> 25:31.960
That's not it

25:33.519 --> 25:34.799
I didn't ask for money

25:35.720 --> 25:36.680
That's why it's evil.

25:37.200 --> 25:37.960
You didn't ask for money?

25:37.960 --> 25:39.160
As I said

25:39.160 --> 25:40.599
Detecting Rep. Jeong’s theft

25:40.599 --> 25:41.960
Representative Jeong signed the statement and

25:41.960 --> 25:42.960
They even made me stamp my hand.

25:43.359 --> 25:44.359
Sore

25:45.000 --> 25:46.079
King Jin for a few days

25:47.079 --> 25:48.920
I was lucky and didn't have gambling debt.

25:49.319 --> 25:50.720
So to Rep. Jeong

25:51.720 --> 25:52.799
They told me to do something else.

25:56.039 --> 25:56.839
Rep. Jeong

26:09.759 --> 26:10.480
Rep. Jeong

26:10.759 --> 26:11.559
Are you going now?

26:11.720 --> 26:12.680
Yes, because the patient is waiting.

26:13.279 --> 26:13.920
I'll take you there

26:13.920 --> 26:14.599
no

26:19.680 --> 26:20.519
thank you

26:22.039 --> 26:22.640
Come this way

26:26.240 --> 26:27.039
Rep. Jeong

26:27.640 --> 26:30.480
Actually, I have a favor to ask.

26:31.000 --> 26:31.880
You can speak comfortably.

26:33.599 --> 26:34.440
Actually, I told you

26:34.839 --> 26:36.119
building a tent

26:36.640 --> 26:38.039
I entrusted you with the work

26:38.880 --> 26:40.160
Must be completed within 3 days

26:40.960 --> 26:41.960
Sore

26:42.799 --> 26:43.920
The workers I use

26:44.119 --> 26:44.920
Because the action is so slow

26:45.359 --> 26:46.279
As fast as possible

26:46.480 --> 26:47.480
Completed in 4 days

26:48.759 --> 26:50.599
If I don't meet the deadline

26:51.119 --> 26:52.960
It's obvious that I'll be punished

26:54.279 --> 26:57.079
I hope Rep. Jeong can help me.

26:57.960 --> 26:58.920
But...

26:58.920 --> 27:00.400
I don't know how to build a tent

27:02.519 --> 27:03.279
Rep. Jeong

27:04.039 --> 27:06.680
Senator, all you
have to do is buy me one day.

27:09.240 --> 27:10.480
Maybe it's me

27:10.480 --> 27:12.279
Today I will never be in a hospital bed

27:13.079 --> 27:16.720
You can tell me not to come down.

27:17.799 --> 27:18.519
How is it?

27:23.039 --> 27:24.720
yes, i will find a way

27:26.839 --> 27:27.839
Thank you, Senator.

27:28.000 --> 27:28.640
Let's go this way.

27:30.039 --> 27:31.359
So Rep. Jeong

27:31.359 --> 27:32.759
Nari’s prescription for medicine

27:32.759 --> 27:33.640
Added one more drug

27:34.119 --> 27:34.720
Thanks to you, Nari

27:34.720 --> 27:36.319
You slept all day.

27:36.799 --> 27:37.440
therefore

27:38.400 --> 27:40.119
King Jin once every few days

27:40.319 --> 27:41.680
He said he went to see Rep. Jeong.

27:41.799 --> 27:43.079
that

27:43.839 --> 27:45.480
The crime is more serious than theft.

27:45.920 --> 27:47.680
King Jin unintentionally made things happen like this.

27:48.880 --> 27:50.240
But something even more horrifying happened later.

27:57.079 --> 27:57.799
Rep. Jeong

27:58.480 --> 28:00.279
We need to talk.

28:06.960 --> 28:08.119
Rep. Jeong

28:08.839 --> 28:10.920
A doctor who treats diseases

28:12.559 --> 28:14.240
How to prescribe medication to a patient

28:14.240 --> 28:15.640
Do you mean to just add something else?

28:19.519 --> 28:20.559
Nari’s medicine is

28:21.359 --> 28:23.480
We make it all in our home pharmacy.

28:24.119 --> 28:25.839
The owner of the pharmacy is okay.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.599
I found out what the congressman did.

28:28.599 --> 28:29.680
That again

28:30.240 --> 28:31.759
I told everything to our master.

28:32.599 --> 28:35.119
What do you plan to do now?

28:36.960 --> 28:38.119
No, that's...

28:38.359 --> 28:40.359
Isn’t this what you asked me to do?

28:41.119 --> 28:42.000
Rep. Jeong

28:42.640 --> 28:45.480
But you can't blame it on me.

28:45.680 --> 28:46.839
When did I tell you to take medicine?

28:47.279 --> 28:48.000
Jinwang

28:48.400 --> 28:50.039
Let's get it straight

28:50.599 --> 28:52.559
Isn’t this all what you told me to do?

28:53.519 --> 28:54.880
When am I?

28:56.240 --> 28:57.160
Are you kidding me?

28:57.799 --> 28:58.720
Is there any evidence?

29:00.519 --> 29:02.039
I have all the certificates

29:03.680 --> 29:05.440
The witness who confessed to the theft by the congressman

29:07.119 --> 29:08.599
I still have it

29:12.599 --> 29:13.559
that is...

29:15.480 --> 29:16.160
Jinwang

29:17.519 --> 29:18.640
So what I mean is

29:19.440 --> 29:20.079
This is it

29:20.319 --> 29:22.680
Isn't this meant to help you?

29:23.119 --> 29:25.240
But you can’t do this.

29:25.880 --> 29:26.480
Isn't it?

29:27.160 --> 29:27.839
no

29:28.960 --> 29:29.880
I don't know, but

29:29.880 --> 29:31.279
To our lawmakers

29:32.880 --> 29:34.400
If something like this happens...

29:34.599 --> 29:36.200
If a congressman does something like that

29:36.799 --> 29:37.799
It's a felony

29:41.960 --> 29:43.440
The master said he would report it to the government office.

29:43.920 --> 29:46.200
I did some research.

29:47.519 --> 29:48.279
Are you reporting it to the government office?

29:49.559 --> 29:50.559
You shouldn't do that.

29:50.559 --> 29:52.200
Absolutely not

29:54.240 --> 29:55.119
Rep. Jeong

29:55.680 --> 29:57.200
If you really report it to the government office

29:59.039 --> 30:00.920
The rest of your life is

30:01.519 --> 30:02.960
I would have to stay in prison

30:04.079 --> 30:04.960
furthermore

30:06.000 --> 30:07.880
Who is our Lord?

30:08.359 --> 30:09.680
Would you really forgive Congressman easily?

30:11.640 --> 30:13.160
Jinwang

30:13.599 --> 30:15.000
please save me

30:15.799 --> 30:17.000
Please, please

30:17.960 --> 30:19.079
I will give you money

30:19.079 --> 30:20.200
I'll give it as much as I can

30:22.319 --> 30:23.200
Rep. Jeong

30:23.759 --> 30:24.640
wake up

30:25.519 --> 30:26.279
Please wake up.

30:27.519 --> 30:28.119
Please sit down

30:32.200 --> 30:33.200
actually

30:34.799 --> 30:36.720
There is one way

30:43.559 --> 30:44.599
What method?

30:47.400 --> 30:50.039
For this matter , I have no choice but to ask our master.

30:50.599 --> 30:52.079
You and I are sworn brothers.

30:53.119 --> 30:56.200
I'm sure you'll help me

30:56.599 --> 30:57.279
great

30:57.559 --> 30:59.079
I'll give you any amount of money

30:59.079 --> 31:01.319
Even if I lose all my money

31:02.279 --> 31:03.240
Rep. Jeong

31:03.599 --> 31:07.400
it's not about money

31:11.000 --> 31:12.359
You're saying it's not about money?

31:12.960 --> 31:13.640
no

31:14.200 --> 31:17.200
We have nothing to do with each other

31:17.599 --> 31:19.599
We can also become sworn brothers.

31:19.799 --> 31:21.680
If you want to be related to me

31:23.160 --> 31:24.720
They don't have to be sworn brothers.

31:25.319 --> 31:26.920
Our ages don't match, right?

31:27.640 --> 31:29.319
I'm not even thirty anymore

31:31.359 --> 31:32.079
but

31:39.519 --> 31:41.559
To Rep. Jeong

31:42.119 --> 31:44.160
I heard you have an only daughter.

31:44.640 --> 31:45.640
I’m seventeen this year.

31:46.799 --> 31:49.039
You're not married yet, right?

31:50.759 --> 31:53.200
How about making in-laws at this time?

31:59.839 --> 32:01.880
This is what Gkung Gkung was all about.

32:02.079 --> 32:02.799
Jinwang

32:03.079 --> 32:04.599
What is this?

32:05.400 --> 32:06.599
shameless guy

32:06.599 --> 32:08.119
How dare you say such a thing?

32:08.640 --> 32:09.559
I'm warning you

32:09.920 --> 32:12.079
Even if it means losing my life

32:12.640 --> 32:13.680
your vain dream

32:13.680 --> 32:15.440
You know that you will never achieve it.

32:20.359 --> 32:21.200
great

32:21.720 --> 32:22.599
Rep. Jeong

32:23.680 --> 32:26.000
is it so

32:26.400 --> 32:28.400
If so, do whatever you want.

32:33.119 --> 32:34.839
But anyway

32:34.839 --> 32:36.839
If the congressman goes to prison

32:37.200 --> 32:38.880
Your beloved only daughter

32:38.880 --> 32:41.319
Would it still be a vain dream?

32:52.920 --> 32:54.240
Isn't this King Jin?

32:54.720 --> 32:55.640
Cold Podu

32:56.359 --> 32:57.359
You mean cold radish?

32:58.599 --> 32:59.799
It was too hasty.

33:00.400 --> 33:01.799
I'm not an easy guy to be cold.

33:02.680 --> 33:04.920
Our plans must never be discovered

33:05.480 --> 33:06.400
Do not worry

33:07.920 --> 33:09.000
I'm just cold

33:09.000 --> 33:10.599
Just tell me that Rep. Jeong stole something.

33:11.920 --> 33:13.559
I asked Rep. Jeong to scold me.

33:19.720 --> 33:20.759
Rep. Jeong

33:21.279 --> 33:23.480
Are you two friends?

33:24.319 --> 33:25.759
Naengpodu, what are you saying...

33:26.319 --> 33:28.519
How dare I
become friends with Rep. Jeong?

33:28.839 --> 33:30.400
Representative Jeong is an adult.

33:30.880 --> 33:32.039
I am today

33:32.279 --> 33:34.240
I came to talk to Rep. Jeong about marriage.

33:34.640 --> 33:36.839
Are you talking to Rep. Jeong about your marriage?

33:40.359 --> 33:41.319
OK got it

33:41.759 --> 33:43.359
Since you're a grown adult, you may have conversations about getting married.

33:43.359 --> 33:44.079
two people's work

33:44.079 --> 33:45.880
It's not something to argue about

33:46.200 --> 33:46.759
Jinwang

33:47.240 --> 33:48.519
Congratulations in advance

33:48.839 --> 33:49.759
Cold Podu

33:49.759 --> 33:51.160
Congratulations are too soon

33:51.839 --> 33:54.880
Rep. Jeong hasn’t responded yet.

33:56.359 --> 33:57.240
Rep. Jeong

34:00.119 --> 34:00.960
Rep. Jeong

34:03.119 --> 34:04.839
I'll ask you again

34:06.960 --> 34:10.239
Would you agree or not?

34:17.360 --> 34:19.639
Yes, I understand

34:20.639 --> 34:23.440
Rep. Jeong doesn't seem to like me very much.

34:24.599 --> 34:25.519
I won't force you any further.

34:26.039 --> 34:26.960
Jinwang

34:27.119 --> 34:29.440
There is something called fate in people’s lives, right?

34:29.440 --> 34:30.440
No matter how greedy you are

34:30.440 --> 34:32.400
It can't happen because it's not meant to be like that.

34:32.480 --> 34:33.239
Isn't that right?

34:33.400 --> 34:35.199
After all,
couldn’t the company’s ledger get married once?

34:35.280 --> 34:35.920
Otherwise, you yourself

34:36.159 --> 34:37.320
try hard

34:38.840 --> 34:39.679
Cold Podu

34:41.079 --> 34:43.840
That's a fair statement.

34:44.159 --> 34:45.440
You also said good things

34:45.679 --> 34:47.679
I'd like to buy you a drink.

34:48.159 --> 34:50.679
Would you like to accept my favor?

34:51.400 --> 34:53.679
I tried so hard to refuse

34:54.880 --> 34:57.079
Yes, I see that you were rejected by Rep. Jeong.

34:58.639 --> 35:00.519
Okay, let's have a drink.

35:00.920 --> 35:01.559
yes

35:02.039 --> 35:03.159
thank you

35:03.440 --> 35:05.519
Today I'm going to drink until I'm drunk.

35:06.559 --> 35:07.400
Good

35:08.159 --> 35:09.039
Cold Podu

35:09.800 --> 35:11.039
I have a thick stomach

35:12.159 --> 35:14.000
I have something to ask you.

35:14.360 --> 35:14.880
okay

35:15.920 --> 35:16.559
Wait

35:37.679 --> 35:39.840
I was so happy that I lost my mind for a moment.

35:40.960 --> 35:41.920
This marriage

35:43.159 --> 35:44.119
I agree

35:44.880 --> 35:45.760
Father-in-law

35:45.760 --> 35:47.320
please accept me

35:48.822 --> 35:50.250
(Artisan Jeong Il-chi,
matchmaker Naengmujil)

35:50.250 --> 35:51.880
Threatening me using my daughter as an excuse?

35:53.079 --> 35:55.559
It's serious.

35:56.840 --> 35:57.679
Not at all

36:00.199 --> 36:01.400
I don't want to end up in prison

36:01.400 --> 36:03.079
He is a person who sells his daughter to King Jin.

36:03.519 --> 36:04.800
To that kind of person

36:04.800 --> 36:05.960
Where is fatherly love?

36:07.840 --> 36:09.599
To deal with Rep. Jeong

36:10.880 --> 36:12.440
We'll have to pay a lot of attention

36:17.960 --> 36:18.559
Let's go

36:25.159 --> 36:25.920
Jinwang

36:26.559 --> 36:28.800
You said you would be cross-examined with Representative Jeong, right?

36:29.519 --> 36:30.760
So I brought you to the assemblyman.

36:32.519 --> 36:33.639
Cross-examination?

36:34.400 --> 36:35.800
The congressman coveted the Yuk family property.

36:36.280 --> 36:37.719
I was caught stealing.

36:38.280 --> 36:41.800
By colluding with King Jin, a servant of the Yuk family,

36:42.159 --> 36:43.199
You tried to poison the master, right?

36:43.280 --> 36:45.239
No, that's...

36:46.920 --> 36:49.519
King Jin is framing me.

36:49.519 --> 36:51.920
King Jin, why are you pushing me so hard?

36:52.400 --> 36:53.760
When did I push you away?

36:55.519 --> 36:56.480
Rep. Jeong

36:57.280 --> 36:59.119
He used his daughter as bait to collect the owner's money.

36:59.119 --> 37:00.800
It was the congressman who told me to steal it.

37:01.079 --> 37:03.159
Otherwise, who will take care of my daughter?

37:03.440 --> 37:05.760
Would you marry a servant?

37:06.000 --> 37:07.559
If that's the case, it's not here.

37:08.400 --> 37:09.639
Let’s go to the government office and talk.

37:10.119 --> 37:11.440
Now I am a member of the congressman's

37:11.760 --> 37:15.280
Affidavits, prescriptions, and even marriage letters

37:16.000 --> 37:16.920
I have it all

37:18.599 --> 37:20.519
I'm really curious what the government will do with this.

37:26.800 --> 37:29.079
Are you really trying to kill me?

37:30.480 --> 37:32.639
Do I have to die to feel better?

37:33.800 --> 37:36.679
Do you think I will feel better if I die?

37:39.599 --> 37:41.639
I can't live like this

37:46.599 --> 37:47.440
Jang Gui, that’s enough.

37:48.000 --> 37:48.800
Stop letting me go

37:52.280 --> 37:53.119
Rep. Jeong

37:53.519 --> 37:55.159
Dead or alive

37:55.559 --> 37:56.519
Take care of that.

37:56.639 --> 37:57.440
but

37:57.719 --> 37:59.719
As long as the marriage certificate is in my hands

38:00.440 --> 38:02.280
If the congressman dies

38:02.800 --> 38:04.119
your daughter's

38:04.519 --> 38:06.400
The mansion and property

38:06.599 --> 38:08.039
It all comes to me

38:08.599 --> 38:09.599
Besides, for me

38:09.920 --> 38:11.639
There is also Podu's testimony.

38:15.079 --> 38:15.800
Do not cry

38:18.639 --> 38:19.599
Do not cry!

38:24.239 --> 38:25.079
Rep. Jeong

38:25.679 --> 38:26.639
Maybe I'm in the government office

38:26.639 --> 38:28.639
What if I say I won’t report it?

38:29.679 --> 38:31.199
And I also held a wedding ceremony for King Jin.

38:31.199 --> 38:32.880
I can convince you to slow down a bit.

38:34.559 --> 38:35.639
even

38:35.639 --> 38:36.960
It could ruin your marriage.

38:41.960 --> 38:44.280
What should I do?

38:44.880 --> 38:46.519
If so, what should I do?

38:48.079 --> 38:49.400
What do you want?

38:51.719 --> 38:53.840
What you did to me

38:54.760 --> 38:56.000
Please keep going

38:58.519 --> 39:01.079
But this time, a little more clearly.

39:18.119 --> 39:18.920
young master

39:19.800 --> 39:20.639
How is it?

39:24.079 --> 39:25.599
The handwriting is the same

39:27.440 --> 39:28.360
You're wrong

39:28.800 --> 39:30.480
where? What's wrong?

39:33.800 --> 39:34.719
Even though I

39:34.719 --> 39:36.159
I'm not good at writing

39:37.000 --> 39:38.239
There is power in handwriting

39:39.800 --> 39:42.239
It's like cutting it down with an axe.

39:43.400 --> 39:44.000
no...

39:44.599 --> 39:46.239
So I wrote it like that, right?

39:46.800 --> 39:48.159
look here

39:50.280 --> 39:51.599
This is a will

39:53.039 --> 39:54.159
If you are going to die soon

39:55.280 --> 39:56.679
I probably can't even hold a brush well.

39:58.239 --> 39:59.199
look at this sentence

39:59.199 --> 40:02.480
Everything is handed over to Yang Yukjik.

40:03.480 --> 40:05.280
Anyone can see that he is full of blood.

40:05.719 --> 40:07.920
This was not written by a patient.

40:08.239 --> 40:10.519
It's closer to the ruling document of the county governor.

40:12.960 --> 40:15.400
No... that's too difficult.

40:16.199 --> 40:18.280
If you write like Nari

40:18.719 --> 40:20.400
They say I'm full-blooded

40:21.199 --> 40:21.760
But...

40:22.280 --> 40:24.079
If you use it hard

40:24.079 --> 40:24.639
that...

40:25.199 --> 40:27.760
It's not Nari's handwriting

40:29.599 --> 40:30.280
It's not difficult

40:31.960 --> 40:33.920
Brother, please stay with Master a little longer.

40:34.920 --> 40:35.480
okay

40:49.199 --> 40:50.960
You must never feed your teacher.

40:52.280 --> 40:53.480
don't let me eat anything

40:55.119 --> 40:56.320
After starving for so many days

40:57.599 --> 40:59.280
Someday soon I will see Nari’s handwriting

41:00.280 --> 41:01.360
You can follow along

41:11.719 --> 41:12.679
This prescription is

41:14.039 --> 41:15.280
It's your doctor's prescription.

41:16.280 --> 41:17.800
A symptom of shortness of breath

41:19.199 --> 41:21.000
This prescription is yours.

41:21.960 --> 41:23.400
Because there is a lot of heat in the liver

41:25.400 --> 41:26.559
When to wean off medication

41:26.559 --> 41:27.960
You need to speak well to the person at the pharmacy.

41:27.960 --> 41:29.239
This is a drug for two people

41:32.159 --> 41:33.039
Rep. Jeong

41:34.159 --> 41:37.440
If you take two drugs at the same time

41:38.119 --> 41:39.800
All diseases disappear

41:41.199 --> 41:42.280
Isn't it completely cured?

41:44.280 --> 41:44.920
It's like that.

41:46.239 --> 41:47.079
That's the way it is

41:50.000 --> 41:50.719
great

41:51.280 --> 41:52.400
Thank you for your hard work, Senator.

41:57.800 --> 41:58.559
young master

42:01.719 --> 42:02.280
Here's the will

42:02.639 --> 42:03.280
Prescription

42:09.039 --> 42:11.000
From today, we are separated from each other

42:11.679 --> 42:13.440
Let's all do our own business.

42:15.360 --> 42:16.360
Yes, master

42:39.371 --> 42:42.297
(Mr. Yuk’s Mansion)

42:49.480 --> 42:50.039
Hey

42:56.840 --> 42:57.679
Look at this

42:58.719 --> 43:01.119
Is this perhaps the Yuk mansion?

43:01.119 --> 43:01.760
Yes that's right

43:02.679 --> 43:03.840
But what happened?

43:05.199 --> 43:07.840
The younger brother of Yuk Won-bok, the owner of this house.

43:07.840 --> 43:08.639
He has six muscles

43:09.159 --> 43:10.079
My brother told me to get together with my family.

43:10.079 --> 43:12.119
They sent me a letter

43:14.365 --> 43:16.788
(Oh, thank you for your strength)

43:17.239 --> 43:18.960
You said I had a younger brother?

43:19.880 --> 43:20.480
father

43:21.760 --> 43:22.320
father

43:29.519 --> 43:31.760
Is this your uncle’s house?

43:31.760 --> 43:32.719
That's right, poor luck.

43:33.239 --> 43:34.079
From here onwards

43:34.440 --> 43:35.719
It will soon be our home

43:49.679 --> 43:51.440
(The fact that Yuk Won Bomb had a younger brother)

43:51.760 --> 43:53.719
(even I didn't know)

43:54.960 --> 43:58.000
(After I committed a crime a long time ago and ran away)

43:58.519 --> 44:00.239
(I knew you didn't come back)

44:03.159 --> 44:05.199
(Meanwhile, the six atomic bombs continue)

44:05.960 --> 44:08.960
(I was sending letters and money to my younger brother)

44:10.079 --> 44:10.960
(But)

44:11.880 --> 44:14.159
(delivered directly through the guest)

44:15.079 --> 44:17.320
(I didn't tell anyone)

44:17.719 --> 44:20.880
(This letter and money were given by Yuk Won-pok to his younger brother)

44:22.519 --> 44:24.119
(As long as my younger brother appears)

44:24.920 --> 44:27.239
(Even if the six atomic bombs kill you immediately)

44:27.760 --> 44:29.639
(Analects of Confucius)
(No matter how well you manipulate your will)

44:30.159 --> 44:31.920
(It's all useless)

44:36.994 --> 44:39.051
