00:43.520 --> 00:44.439
How long have you worked?

00:45.079 --> 00:47.240
Eight years, Captain Shea

00:48.359 --> 00:49.320
You are in your final year

00:49.640 --> 00:50.799
Do you know who I am?

00:51.479 --> 00:52.960
Yes in deed

00:52.960 --> 00:55.119
You are Captain Xia
sent from Nitai Yamin

00:55.119 --> 00:57.000
(nitai: short for inspector general)
to oversee the case

00:59.560 --> 01:00.759
Since you are in your final year

01:01.240 --> 01:02.399
And know who I am

01:03.119 --> 01:05.560
Why do you still treat me
like an outsider?

01:07.680 --> 01:11.120
Captain Shea, I don't understand

01:13.640 --> 01:15.159
Don't go to your units

01:15.159 --> 01:16.760
on

01:17.200 --> 01:19.120
How dare you show that in front of me

01:20.480 --> 01:23.359
I swear I don't dare

01:23.359 --> 01:24.359
You don't dare?

01:29.239 --> 01:30.599
I heard the scent of the enemy

01:31.000 --> 01:32.599
Wind makes butterflies itch

01:33.359 --> 01:34.280
His neck

01:34.760 --> 01:36.519
She wasn't injured at all

01:37.000 --> 01:37.856
permission

01:38.200 --> 01:40.400
We can pull it free and check

01:41.760 --> 01:42.879
please forgive me

01:42.879 --> 01:44.719
I didn't mean to cheat

01:44.959 --> 01:46.760
He was suffering

01:47.159 --> 01:49.359
From hemorrhoids recently

01:49.519 --> 01:51.280
for this reason...

01:52.079 --> 01:52.992
you are so sweet

01:53.719 --> 01:54.599
loyal

01:55.560 --> 01:56.512
good

01:57.120 --> 01:59.079
I'll help you

02:00.120 --> 02:01.319
Those who look like him

02:02.400 --> 02:03.280
There are three more

02:04.680 --> 02:06.040
All of you, lay down

03:03.744 --> 03:07.552
= Rippy Town
== Episode 5 =

03:09.560 --> 03:10.464
to hit

03:11.319 --> 03:12.192
Hit

03:12.960 --> 03:13.888
Hit

03:14.919 --> 03:16.199
all of you

03:17.120 --> 03:18.960
Don't blame me for being merciless

03:18.960 --> 03:19.808
Hit

03:20.680 --> 03:21.600
To a security guard

03:22.080 --> 03:23.280
Efficiency is important

03:23.280 --> 03:24.224
I passed

03:25.240 --> 03:27.439
Do you know why?

03:27.520 --> 03:28.416
Get lost

03:29.319 --> 03:30.159
Because every situation

03:31.280 --> 03:33.159
She has a deadline

03:33.159 --> 03:34.080
I hit

03:34.800 --> 03:35.159
Let's go

03:35.159 --> 03:36.319
What motivates you to meet a deadline?

03:37.439 --> 03:37.840
Let's go

03:37.840 --> 03:39.080
Good chain at the bottom

03:39.800 --> 03:40.672
Hit

03:41.680 --> 03:42.592
Hit

03:44.240 --> 03:47.319
A big case like this happened

03:47.319 --> 03:48.160
I hit

03:48.719 --> 03:49.800
It's been more than ten days

03:50.000 --> 03:50.912
a hit

03:51.680 --> 03:53.159
However, no criminal was arrested

03:53.319 --> 03:54.176
Hit

03:56.439 --> 03:57.312
Let's go

03:57.719 --> 03:58.560
the general inspector

03:58.560 --> 04:01.400
He sent me to give you a good picture

04:01.400 --> 04:04.960
I hit

04:06.280 --> 04:07.136
a hit

04:08.199 --> 04:09.039
to stop

04:10.000 --> 04:12.560
You all follow the rules very well

04:12.560 --> 04:14.120
None of you cried

04:14.759 --> 04:15.680
very good

04:17.079 --> 04:20.439
You're not supposed
to cry when you get hit

04:20.680 --> 04:22.800
The Inspector General gave me one month

04:23.839 --> 04:26.519
Next month, hopefully

04:28.160 --> 04:29.160
We can work well together

04:29.759 --> 04:32.399
I think you will know about me

04:33.160 --> 04:34.759
after today

04:35.959 --> 04:37.040
And next month

04:37.319 --> 04:39.480
Don't be lazy anymore

04:39.480 --> 04:42.040
Otherwise, before you know me

04:42.279 --> 04:45.439
You will learn more
about beating butterflies

04:48.879 --> 04:49.720
Hit

04:51.480 --> 04:53.439
Are you Captain Ling's disciple?

04:55.480 --> 04:56.352
Hit

04:58.800 --> 05:00.680
Are you investigating the cemetery
outside of town?

05:01.600 --> 05:02.528
Yes

05:02.759 --> 05:05.199
I investigate the remains
waiting on the bridge

05:05.199 --> 05:06.048
Hit

05:06.560 --> 05:07.480
what did you find?

05:08.120 --> 05:09.759
I found a grave that had been dug

05:10.120 --> 05:11.008
He was injured

05:12.639 --> 05:13.600
And after that?

05:14.560 --> 05:17.399
It was a man named Chen Wang
who jumped into the river 20 years ago

05:18.160 --> 05:19.008
Hit

05:21.240 --> 05:22.080
any thing else?

05:22.879 --> 05:24.279
For now, nothing else

05:26.079 --> 05:26.944
to stop

05:27.240 --> 05:28.160
to stop

05:31.319 --> 05:32.639
Speaking of Captain Lang

05:32.800 --> 05:34.439
He's really good at his job

05:35.240 --> 05:37.879
I can't believe
he has a useless student like you

05:41.240 --> 05:42.176
my lord

05:43.040 --> 05:45.120
Brutally killed

05:45.560 --> 05:47.439
She didn't even sign a suspect

05:49.319 --> 05:51.439
At the very least, you can ask for information

05:52.240 --> 05:54.680
From Fang Gang and Da Gang

05:56.839 --> 05:57.696
permission

05:59.360 --> 06:01.920
I'm not useless

06:04.160 --> 06:05.480
What can you do?

06:06.680 --> 06:09.560
I have saved a lot of effort for you

06:11.360 --> 06:12.320
What did you do?

06:13.279 --> 06:16.000
You don't have
to

06:19.519 --> 06:23.000
I solved them

06:23.360 --> 06:24.240
What did you say?

06:26.959 --> 06:27.959
I mean

06:29.279 --> 06:33.199
You've solved it

06:33.560 --> 06:35.160
No da gang

06:36.120 --> 06:38.560
Or da gang in do county

06:40.959 --> 06:42.120
Move

06:42.839 --> 06:43.712
Move

06:44.959 --> 06:45.856
Sangang

06:46.600 --> 06:49.040
They arrested those
who tried to jump over the wall and run

06:50.040 --> 06:51.240
Well done, Jane

06:53.040 --> 06:54.000
Sangang

06:54.000 --> 06:55.079
No offense

06:55.360 --> 06:56.480
But others

06:56.480 --> 06:58.319
He will complain about you

07:00.759 --> 07:02.759
I know your personality

07:03.360 --> 07:04.759
Just a warning to you

07:04.759 --> 07:06.839
You better not do this again

07:08.360 --> 07:09.280
Jain

07:09.480 --> 07:11.759
You're just afraid of losing money

07:12.439 --> 07:14.759
Even tea matters to some people

07:14.920 --> 07:15.959
Thank you, Jane

07:16.439 --> 07:17.560
Understood

07:27.279 --> 07:28.160
Understood

07:29.680 --> 07:30.680
What was he doing?

07:32.920 --> 07:36.160
You're talking nonsense

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
If you don't trust me

07:38.759 --> 07:40.279
You can check it yourself

07:41.759 --> 07:43.040
Can you do that?

07:43.319 --> 07:45.759
After all,
I am Captain Leng's disciple

07:46.839 --> 07:47.776
LV San

07:48.199 --> 07:49.519
Go check it out now

07:52.576 --> 07:53.480
Mr. Song

07:53.480 --> 07:54.368
Captain Shea?

07:55.360 --> 07:56.360
What can I do for you?

07:57.120 --> 07:59.040
Do you know what Chewie did?

07:59.519 --> 08:00.399
what did he do?

08:01.360 --> 08:03.600
Five leaders
of the Fang and Da gang were arrested

08:11.639 --> 08:12.576
Come here

08:21.120 --> 08:22.160
GIVE me your hand

08:23.160 --> 08:24.000
Your hand

08:26.079 --> 08:27.240
Your hand

08:35.720 --> 08:36.720
I can't know

08:38.440 --> 08:40.159
Who belongs to the five of them?

08:40.320 --> 08:42.919
But these are all recent

08:43.320 --> 08:44.360
They must have their teeth in it

08:46.559 --> 08:47.879
I'll give these teeth to you

08:50.120 --> 08:50.960
Mr. Song

08:51.559 --> 08:52.600
What do you mean by this?

08:55.639 --> 08:57.519
I questioned the five people

08:58.200 --> 08:59.639
They are dangerous criminals

08:59.919 --> 09:01.480
I can't judge them

09:01.720 --> 09:04.200
So they were all taken
to the governorate

09:05.200 --> 09:06.480
Only their teeth are retained

09:08.759 --> 09:10.039
Fang gang

09:10.399 --> 09:11.919
And da gang just disappeared

09:14.519 --> 09:16.519
Do you sympathize with them?

09:18.840 --> 09:19.720
Without them

09:20.519 --> 09:21.600
Since I'm new here

09:22.679 --> 09:24.120
How do I investigate this case?

09:33.000 --> 09:34.840
You have to be kidding

09:35.320 --> 09:36.440
You are Captain Shea

09:36.440 --> 09:39.440
You cannot investigate a case

09:39.679 --> 09:41.120
Without their help?

09:43.679 --> 09:44.720
Easy for you to say

09:45.879 --> 09:46.752
If he is a guarantor

09:47.320 --> 09:49.360
Out of County DO commits a crime here

09:50.279 --> 09:51.799
Who can I ask for information?

09:53.159 --> 09:54.000
The protected one

09:55.080 --> 09:56.759
However, you can vaccinate children

09:58.320 --> 09:59.279
Mr. Song

10:00.399 --> 10:01.639
I will tell the truth

10:02.919 --> 10:04.320
To the Inspector General

10:04.799 --> 10:06.159
I hope you can put in a good word

10:08.159 --> 10:09.200
On my behalf

10:32.840 --> 10:33.696
Mr. Feng

10:36.559 --> 10:37.440
Mr. Feng

10:39.200 --> 10:40.440
You two are early

10:42.159 --> 10:43.159
you are so sweet

10:43.559 --> 10:44.559
Make soup for us

10:45.856 --> 10:46.720
do not do

10:46.879 --> 10:47.744
You can not

10:48.440 --> 10:50.320
How dare you eat his food

10:52.960 --> 10:54.320
What kind of soup do you make?

10:54.679 --> 10:55.559
Tae Jin Sup

10:55.559 --> 10:56.679
I take Tae Jin's soul?

10:57.159 --> 10:58.360
It is not toxic

10:58.360 --> 11:00.480
It's just a mixture

11:00.480 --> 11:01.559
From various herbs

11:01.919 --> 11:03.200
What are these made for?

11:03.480 --> 11:05.679
Oil paintings
and handwriting to make money

11:05.840 --> 11:07.039
I always have buyers

11:07.039 --> 11:08.360
But it doesn't offer much

11:08.360 --> 11:09.480
A few days ago

11:09.480 --> 11:10.840
I found a book from my uncle

11:11.120 --> 11:13.600
Includes how to calligraphy
and oil paintings

11:13.840 --> 11:14.799
This method includes

11:15.320 --> 11:17.200
Clean the paper several times
with this soup

11:17.320 --> 11:19.639
Then use a layer of Baiji liquid

11:19.879 --> 11:20.759
The effect is excellent

11:21.159 --> 11:22.600
So, I made some oil paintings

11:24.039 --> 11:25.679
Claiming it was
my uncle's group

11:26.200 --> 11:27.799
So they were photographed immediately

11:28.039 --> 11:29.639
The price was ten times
more than before

11:29.840 --> 11:32.559
You are visiting informational boards
to scam people

11:32.559 --> 11:34.759
Don't forget I'm a pigeon

11:35.600 --> 11:37.440
Why are you flirting, you bastard?

11:37.879 --> 11:39.080
Who makes the paintings?

11:39.759 --> 11:41.960
I did not forge anyone's signatures

11:42.559 --> 11:43.960
I just changed the handwriting

11:44.440 --> 11:46.720
And I gave myself new nicknames

11:47.200 --> 11:50.000
Such as Ancient Man Huangting
and Ancient Man of Black Stone

11:50.679 --> 11:52.679
They thought they had found a bargain
in an old painting

11:53.000 --> 11:54.320
What does this have to do with me?

11:55.600 --> 11:56.576
Mr. Feng

11:57.179 --> 11:58.759
Can people change handwriting?

12:00.399 --> 12:02.600
I learned calligraphy
and seal carving from my uncle

12:03.080 --> 12:04.440
If the first is in Do County

12:04.720 --> 12:07.080
I will be second

12:10.080 --> 12:10.960
So

12:12.519 --> 12:14.720
You can imitate other people's handwriting

12:15.399 --> 12:16.352
This is not difficult

12:18.000 --> 12:21.639
Turkey, does your uncle
have medical books?

12:23.639 --> 12:26.240
Yes, it does

12:28.879 --> 12:30.000
Give me something

12:30.360 --> 12:31.200
What?

12:33.159 --> 12:34.048
Your hand

12:41.408 --> 12:42.320
I'll leave first

12:42.320 --> 12:43.168
take care of yourself

12:44.559 --> 12:45.440
Mr. Cheng

12:49.360 --> 12:50.360
do you remember me?

12:54.240 --> 12:55.679
You are Captain Leng's disciple

12:56.600 --> 12:58.120
The prescriptions I showed you before...

12:58.120 --> 12:59.919
I told you

12:59.919 --> 13:01.879
Nothing wrong with
those prescriptions

13:02.480 --> 13:03.519
I know

13:03.879 --> 13:05.840
I found more
that you described as well

13:06.320 --> 13:07.200
Please take a look

13:08.840 --> 13:09.792
permission

13:10.559 --> 13:12.600
It's what I described
to Lu Yuanbao and Chen Wang

13:16.120 --> 13:17.399
I did not write these prescriptions

13:18.480 --> 13:19.360
truly?

13:19.840 --> 13:21.960
But it has your handwriting
and signature

13:35.360 --> 13:37.200
Not descriptive recipes

13:37.200 --> 13:38.960
It's toxic

13:38.960 --> 13:41.840
Yes, that's what the coroner said

13:42.720 --> 13:45.000
So, you admit it?

13:45.000 --> 13:46.279
Don't accuse me falsely

13:47.600 --> 13:49.639
The dose is one herb
in this prescription

13:49.639 --> 13:51.120
It can cause people

13:51.120 --> 13:52.960
To die immediately

13:53.480 --> 13:56.279
Therefore, they were poisoned to death

14:00.240 --> 14:01.320
prattle

14:02.120 --> 14:03.919
Chen Wang drowned himself

14:03.919 --> 14:05.200
Lu Yuanbao was killed

14:05.480 --> 14:07.519
Lu Yuanbao was killed by Li Dongteng?

14:16.759 --> 14:18.519
You can't install this on me

14:19.039 --> 14:21.000
It is not a prescription

14:21.200 --> 14:23.360
There is no pharmacy
to fill this prescription

14:23.480 --> 14:26.919
Besides, the case was closed
20 years ago

14:27.120 --> 14:29.879
Lu Yuanbao was poisoned to death
by his younger brother

14:33.120 --> 14:35.600
These prescriptions were found
in the case file

14:36.679 --> 14:38.159
I don't know if it's real

14:38.559 --> 14:39.600
So I came to ask you

14:40.720 --> 14:41.632
Mr. Cheng

14:42.440 --> 14:43.960
If you know anything

14:44.200 --> 14:45.679
About what happened 20 years ago

14:46.000 --> 14:47.399
You'd better tell me honestly

14:48.279 --> 14:49.184
Unlike that

14:50.480 --> 14:51.360
Maybe one day

14:51.360 --> 14:53.080
I will find some other prescriptions

14:54.000 --> 14:55.320
And I must bother you again

15:18.240 --> 15:19.679
Were you feeling?

15:20.200 --> 15:21.519
Very vulgar

15:21.840 --> 15:22.759
And indignation

15:23.480 --> 15:24.720
With a red face?

15:24.879 --> 15:25.728
Let's go

15:26.480 --> 15:27.392
Get out your tongue

15:28.320 --> 15:29.280
For any reason?

15:29.639 --> 15:31.000
I am a doctor

15:31.440 --> 15:32.840
Do what I say

15:35.440 --> 15:36.416
Get out your tongue

15:42.399 --> 15:45.480
Stuffed lips, dry tongue
and raspy breathing

15:47.000 --> 15:48.960
Barbarism hurts you

15:49.480 --> 15:50.368
Let's go

15:50.720 --> 15:52.440
Let me feel your pulse

15:53.120 --> 15:54.600
Must buy

15:56.039 --> 15:58.600
Iced, fantasy alkaloid pendant
dried ginger and baelene

15:58.600 --> 16:01.320
And soup and hepatitis
and drinking them in soup

16:02.120 --> 16:02.960
Did you get that?

16:04.279 --> 16:05.159
honestly

16:06.000 --> 16:07.639
I'm not bragging

16:07.960 --> 16:09.159
Throughout the entire Doe Province

16:09.360 --> 16:11.879
You will not find a better doctor than me

16:12.320 --> 16:13.280
Guess what?

16:13.720 --> 16:15.200
District judge

16:16.320 --> 16:18.360
When he feels uncomfortable

16:18.360 --> 16:19.799
He will come to me for treatment

16:20.279 --> 16:22.000
You're annoying me

16:22.480 --> 16:23.960
But I won't take it seriously

16:24.480 --> 16:25.960
I will do a good job

16:25.960 --> 16:28.720
Through your treatment

16:29.120 --> 16:30.480
When you feel better

16:31.080 --> 16:32.799
You must take good care of yourself

16:33.559 --> 16:35.440
Don't look for trouble again

16:43.679 --> 16:46.039
Guys, he
checked the case files

16:46.399 --> 16:48.399
From Dou Province

16:49.519 --> 16:52.000
I didn't expect the booming Du County

16:52.279 --> 16:53.840
To be so unstable

16:54.720 --> 16:57.559
These are the unresolved issues
from the past six months

16:58.000 --> 17:00.320
Based on my 30 years of experience

17:00.320 --> 17:01.200
Among these cases

17:01.440 --> 17:03.080
We may find

17:03.279 --> 17:05.279
Some connections
to the two murder cases

17:05.279 --> 17:06.480
We are working

17:06.480 --> 17:07.920
Once these issues are resolved

17:08.240 --> 17:09.799
More evidence about the murder cases

17:10.119 --> 17:11.319
You will stand out

17:11.960 --> 17:13.160
after that

17:14.279 --> 17:15.839
I've divided you all into teams

17:16.039 --> 17:17.240
With each team for one issue

17:17.240 --> 17:18.400
Those whose names are called

17:18.720 --> 17:19.640
Come forward

17:20.079 --> 17:21.559
Present the case to your team

17:22.200 --> 17:24.119
Jia Liu, Li Bo

17:24.119 --> 17:24.480
Yes

17:24.480 --> 17:25.160
Zhang Ruona

17:25.160 --> 17:25.599
Yes

17:25.599 --> 17:26.279
Wang Dehabao

17:26.279 --> 17:26.599
Yes

17:26.599 --> 17:27.319
Cui Laohao

17:27.319 --> 17:27.839
Yes

17:33.839 --> 17:34.519
Liu Ge

17:34.519 --> 17:34.880
Yes

17:34.880 --> 17:35.440
Ni Kang

17:35.440 --> 17:35.799
Yes

17:35.799 --> 17:36.519
chow duck

17:36.519 --> 17:37.000
Yes

17:37.000 --> 17:37.759
Shen Dehtshong

17:37.759 --> 17:38.160
Yes

17:38.160 --> 17:38.759
Li fa

17:38.759 --> 17:39.160
Yes

17:39.160 --> 17:39.839
Yang Yan Hua

17:39.839 --> 17:40.240
Yes

17:40.240 --> 17:40.880
Zhang Jinliang

17:40.880 --> 17:41.279
Yes

17:41.279 --> 17:41.720
Zhang Jian

17:41.720 --> 17:42.160
Yes

17:42.160 --> 17:42.799
Gao Xisong

17:43.000 --> 17:43.519
Yes

17:50.680 --> 17:51.559
This is your case

18:01.079 --> 18:01.920
That's it?

18:04.400 --> 18:05.248
Yes

18:05.559 --> 18:06.464
What?

18:07.240 --> 18:08.519
What about Ko Sangg?

18:11.240 --> 18:12.192
That's it

18:16.759 --> 18:17.696
Dear brothers

18:18.799 --> 18:20.319
Did you understand all your issues?

18:22.079 --> 18:22.976
Captain Shea

18:23.759 --> 18:24.839
He didn't miss Sangeng

18:28.079 --> 18:28.960
no

18:30.119 --> 18:31.440
Sangeng is efficient at work

18:31.759 --> 18:33.400
Also, he is Captain Lang's apprentice

18:33.400 --> 18:34.920
He deliberately allowed it

18:34.920 --> 18:37.559
Investigation into the case of Captain Ling

18:40.160 --> 18:43.160
Be effective in handling cases

18:43.440 --> 18:44.920
The deadline that I give you all is

18:46.279 --> 18:47.168
Five days

18:51.160 --> 18:54.359
If you fail, you will be punished

18:54.519 --> 18:56.920
Captain Xia, this is unfair

18:57.519 --> 18:59.880
Dissolve the Fang Gang and the Da Gang

19:00.319 --> 19:01.440
Why is he okay?

19:01.559 --> 19:03.319
Instead, should he be punished?

19:03.559 --> 19:05.119
If the case is not resolved within five days

19:05.119 --> 19:06.319
(righteousness)

19:06.319 --> 19:07.400
And punish them

19:08.880 --> 19:10.240
This means you are useless

19:10.920 --> 19:12.279
Don't blame others

19:16.920 --> 19:17.792
I finish

19:28.160 --> 19:30.160
Sangeng, I get it

19:30.160 --> 19:31.640
They give you a long time

19:41.440 --> 19:42.368
Captain Shea

19:42.920 --> 19:45.079
It's a good idea
to use it to assert your authority

19:45.359 --> 19:47.640
He must be hoping to take revenge on his master

19:48.319 --> 19:50.319
If we make him surrender
he can be useful

19:52.519 --> 19:53.440
It won't be useful

19:54.319 --> 19:55.279
What's more

19:56.240 --> 19:57.440
He will get in the way

19:58.599 --> 19:59.456
Levi San

20:01.279 --> 20:02.144
Efficiency issues

20:02.519 --> 20:04.119
To file

20:04.640 --> 20:06.440
We only have a month

20:07.400 --> 20:08.640
We are new here

20:10.880 --> 20:13.359
So how can we be effective?

20:14.799 --> 20:15.759
permission

20:17.319 --> 20:19.039
Let everyone continue to work tirelessly

20:20.519 --> 20:23.279
Everyone needs to work well together

20:29.359 --> 20:30.319
Efficiency is important

20:31.160 --> 20:33.000
To file

20:42.000 --> 20:43.799
Sangeng, I was just looking for you

20:44.440 --> 20:46.560
What is the matter?

20:46.680 --> 20:48.359
The neighbors brought you something

20:48.599 --> 20:49.839
Your mother asked him to bring it

20:52.288 --> 20:53.200
What is this?

20:53.200 --> 20:55.240
I don't know, just take a look

20:56.680 --> 20:57.632
Hit him

21:02.920 --> 21:05.160
Within five days, we must strike

21:05.160 --> 21:07.680
We can't leave you here

21:08.319 --> 21:10.759
Today, we're going to hit you up front

21:10.920 --> 21:11.808
Hit him

21:18.680 --> 21:19.880
Stop, Mr. Song is here

21:19.880 --> 21:21.680
Mr. Song

21:24.759 --> 21:25.920
Don't stop

21:27.559 --> 21:30.279
I was just passing by

21:31.119 --> 21:32.032
To see what was going on

21:32.920 --> 21:35.559
Plus, if you beat him to death

21:36.519 --> 21:38.759
Or paralyze his health

21:39.359 --> 21:40.559
When I question you

21:41.440 --> 21:43.359
I won't need to find other witnesses

21:43.559 --> 21:45.319
Mr. Song, we're playing with him

21:45.319 --> 21:46.240
we are playing

21:46.440 --> 21:47.296
Yes

21:47.440 --> 21:49.880
Turns out you're not busy

21:50.880 --> 21:53.920
You even have time to play together

21:55.440 --> 21:56.920
Do you want to lose your job?

22:00.519 --> 22:02.519
Will you keep playing?

22:03.160 --> 22:04.384
Let's go

22:13.160 --> 22:14.144
Ko Sangg

22:14.599 --> 22:15.440
Remember

22:15.599 --> 22:16.839
Don't walk alone in the narrow alleys

22:18.319 --> 22:19.880
In Yamin

22:24.519 --> 22:26.920
I didn't expect the referees squad
to turn out like this

22:26.920 --> 22:28.640
Maybe it's always been like this

22:29.119 --> 22:30.359
I understand now

22:30.720 --> 22:32.799
In the past, my teacher was protective of me

22:36.440 --> 22:37.440
My father died

22:38.039 --> 22:39.559
You should be more careful

22:39.759 --> 22:40.920
It doesn't make any sense

22:41.680 --> 22:43.079
Captain Shea wants
to assert his authority

22:43.440 --> 22:44.920
And I'm just a convenient target

22:46.119 --> 22:47.759
So, what do you plan to do now?

22:48.680 --> 22:51.160
I will continue to investigate with Dr. Cheng

22:51.160 --> 22:52.640
He must know something

22:52.799 --> 22:54.640
But he's a tough guy

22:54.640 --> 22:56.039
He doesn't seem to have any weaknesses

22:56.039 --> 22:57.799
I was asking how things are going

22:57.960 --> 22:58.960
With Captain Shea

23:01.759 --> 23:02.624
permission

23:04.680 --> 23:05.880
I have to agree to it now

23:06.599 --> 23:07.960
And wait for him to leave

23:08.440 --> 23:09.400
Yes

23:09.400 --> 23:10.920
This is a wise idea

23:11.960 --> 23:14.599
But if my teacher is alive

23:15.200 --> 23:16.160
He would definitely object

23:17.359 --> 23:19.960
He was going to fight against Captain Xia

23:20.799 --> 23:22.000
My teacher never used violence

23:22.319 --> 23:24.279
To solve a case

23:25.200 --> 23:27.680
Sangeng, my father was a captain

23:27.680 --> 23:28.799
But you are just a word

23:29.079 --> 23:30.880
How can you fight Captain Shea?

23:35.200 --> 23:36.799
If i were you...

23:37.680 --> 23:38.920
If it's me...

23:39.200 --> 23:40.359
If it were me

23:41.000 --> 23:42.079
What will you do?

23:49.039 --> 23:50.480
My father once said

23:51.039 --> 23:54.000
Every person has
at least three weaknesses

23:54.440 --> 23:55.328
Firstly

23:55.920 --> 23:57.279
His biggest fear

23:59.039 --> 24:00.759
Captain Xia must be afraid

24:01.480 --> 24:03.799
He couldn't make the case in time

24:07.240 --> 24:08.128
secondly

24:08.519 --> 24:09.920
His biggest desire

24:12.839 --> 24:14.079
His biggest desire

24:14.519 --> 24:16.240
The case must be settled in a timely manner

24:17.759 --> 24:18.656
Third

24:20.319 --> 24:22.240
Its biggest advantage

24:23.640 --> 24:24.480
My father told me

24:25.240 --> 24:27.559
That people often stumble
on their strengths

24:27.839 --> 24:29.119
But not their weaknesses

24:29.559 --> 24:32.160
Because people are very careful
about their weaknesses

24:32.599 --> 24:34.200
But over-reliance on their strengths

24:34.759 --> 24:37.480
So it is the biggest advantage for the individual

24:38.279 --> 24:40.559
It is also his biggest weakness

24:43.559 --> 24:45.079
What is it

24:45.200 --> 24:46.839
Captain Xia's greatest strength?

24:48.119 --> 24:49.024
Through people?

24:49.839 --> 24:50.752
no

24:51.680 --> 24:54.079
It is very sophisticated

24:54.880 --> 24:57.240
He is very familiar
with the officials' rules

25:00.799 --> 25:02.000
Got it, Jerry

25:02.200 --> 25:03.119
I have a solution now

25:03.880 --> 25:04.799
Any solution?

25:06.680 --> 25:09.880
According to the rules of officials
to solve the case, you must be fast

25:10.400 --> 25:12.759
There are many ways to solve this

25:17.599 --> 25:18.519
Mr. Song

25:18.519 --> 25:19.400
Mr. Zhang is here

25:27.240 --> 25:28.192
Mr. Song

25:28.720 --> 25:29.640
What can i do for you

25:33.039 --> 25:34.016
Mr. Song?

25:38.720 --> 25:39.648
Mr. Zhang?

25:41.279 --> 25:42.680
Is Mr. Xie okay?

25:43.039 --> 25:45.279
Thank you for your question, Mr. Choi...

25:45.279 --> 25:46.176
permission

25:46.599 --> 25:47.440
You sit down first

25:48.240 --> 25:49.680
Let me finish this issue before we talk

25:51.279 --> 25:52.128
I will not bother you

25:58.240 --> 25:59.136
Hao Daqing

25:59.960 --> 26:03.039
Wang Laoshi accuses you of
seizing his domain by force?

26:03.359 --> 26:04.319
Did this really happen?

26:04.799 --> 26:07.319
Sir, he rented his land to me

26:07.319 --> 26:08.400
I have a contract as proof

26:11.039 --> 26:12.759
I have read this contract

26:13.039 --> 26:14.240
One of the rice fields

26:15.079 --> 26:17.039
The lease term is 20 years

26:18.119 --> 26:19.079
Rent...

26:22.079 --> 26:23.440
One liver of rice per year

26:24.039 --> 26:24.896
correct

26:25.240 --> 26:26.112
my lord

26:26.400 --> 26:27.519
Please look at it carefully

26:28.279 --> 26:31.000
It has Wang Laoshi's fingerprints on it

26:34.160 --> 26:36.920
Only Wang Laoshi
had more than two Earth Mu

26:36.920 --> 26:38.480
Why did he rent you a piece of land?

26:40.160 --> 26:42.440
Wang Laoshi does not have any children

26:42.599 --> 26:43.920
He is over 50 years old

26:44.119 --> 26:45.359
He... he can't work

26:46.039 --> 26:46.880
permission

26:47.680 --> 26:49.359
I have five children, I have more work

26:52.079 --> 26:53.440
What you say makes sense

26:57.599 --> 27:02.720
But the rent scared me

27:02.720 --> 27:04.599
One mu of rice fields
produces two crops a year

27:04.759 --> 27:07.680
The output can reach three
or four dan

27:08.079 --> 27:11.160
The rent is only one liver of rice

27:13.119 --> 27:14.720
Less than one percent of output

27:17.480 --> 27:18.400
my lord

27:19.319 --> 27:22.160
This is the deal we agreed to

27:22.480 --> 27:25.039
No one complained

27:27.279 --> 27:28.224
Hao Daqing

27:28.519 --> 27:31.440
How much land
can produce one liver of rice?

27:32.079 --> 27:35.200
About a square foot

27:35.799 --> 27:38.440
About the surface area of ​​the chair

27:49.160 --> 27:50.960
You are very good at arithmetic

27:52.960 --> 27:57.200
This is not strange

27:58.079 --> 27:59.519
After all, I am a peasant

28:00.440 --> 28:01.319
What about this?

28:02.160 --> 28:03.319
I will make a fair decision

28:04.880 --> 28:08.440
I will order Wang Laoshi
to give you his rice field

28:10.279 --> 28:12.440
But you should leave it
a square foot of land

28:12.920 --> 28:15.799
To prevent him
from regretting and charging at you again

28:15.799 --> 28:18.144
That would save us a lot of trouble
what do you think?

28:19.920 --> 28:20.800
my lord

28:22.359 --> 28:23.480
Are you serious?

28:25.759 --> 28:26.720
I judge the case

28:26.960 --> 28:27.920
How can I not be serious?

28:29.119 --> 28:29.960
Thank you

28:30.279 --> 28:31.200
Thank you

28:42.680 --> 28:45.680
Do you know what's stuck your back?

28:46.880 --> 28:47.744
permission

28:48.319 --> 28:52.039
This looks like a pig's lining

28:53.640 --> 28:56.839
Do you know why it's stuck on your back?

28:57.599 --> 28:59.759
Actually, I don't know

29:00.519 --> 29:01.720
The prison warden suspended her

29:02.319 --> 29:03.599
Ali yesterday

29:04.000 --> 29:05.440
It must be a base in Yamin

29:08.559 --> 29:09.559
Does it make you watch?

29:11.279 --> 29:12.160
my lord

29:12.559 --> 29:13.720
I thought so

29:13.720 --> 29:15.519
It's so exciting now

29:17.720 --> 29:18.560
It's very problematic

29:18.960 --> 29:19.904
Hao Daqing

29:21.319 --> 29:23.200
I plan to remove two skins

29:23.200 --> 29:24.960
From your body

29:25.319 --> 29:27.160
To exchange
for Wang Laoqi Café

29:27.680 --> 29:28.640
What are you saying?

29:28.640 --> 29:30.240
No, don't

29:32.640 --> 29:33.880
Then admit the truth to me

29:49.319 --> 29:50.208
Two injured

29:50.519 --> 29:51.599
Do you have enough rest?

29:51.960 --> 29:53.119
We have two more sites to visit

29:56.799 --> 29:57.728
Cheung

29:58.480 --> 30:00.279
We go easy

30:00.864 --> 30:01.720
We have accompanied you

30:01.720 --> 30:03.640
To visit the amusement park all day, right?

30:03.720 --> 30:05.440
Even if you lack experience

30:05.759 --> 30:07.319
You must have correct logic?

30:07.559 --> 30:08.880
Do you think I'm a thief?

30:08.880 --> 30:10.599
Will he sell the stolen goods
at the local workshop?

30:11.240 --> 30:12.119
exactly

30:12.359 --> 30:13.759
There was no other way

30:13.759 --> 30:16.240
She insisted
it was not a common case of theft

30:17.039 --> 30:18.480
Otherwise we won't waste time with you

30:19.200 --> 30:21.559
When people thought you were stupid

30:22.039 --> 30:22.920
I didn't believe them

30:23.480 --> 30:27.000
Now, we have visited almost
all the amusement parks in this county

30:27.400 --> 30:28.680
But we didn't find anything

30:29.839 --> 30:32.079
I don't want to do
this stupid thing with you anymore

30:39.559 --> 30:40.448
Mr. Six

30:41.480 --> 30:42.464
What is your opinion

30:42.640 --> 30:43.552
I?

30:44.400 --> 30:45.240
I...

30:47.400 --> 30:49.200
I will accompany you

30:52.720 --> 30:54.119
I will drink water with you

30:54.599 --> 30:57.440
Later, you visit the amusement park alone

31:03.440 --> 31:05.119
That's what I thought

31:05.319 --> 31:07.279
There are two more anyway

31:07.279 --> 31:08.319
I can do it on my own

31:08.920 --> 31:13.079
I'll let you know if I have any news

31:13.720 --> 31:15.440
I'm leaving

31:15.440 --> 31:16.384
You go

31:21.559 --> 31:22.400
Mr. Song

31:22.559 --> 31:24.200
The criminal signed
his confession paper

31:24.920 --> 31:25.888
Take it out

31:26.519 --> 31:27.559
Use it 50 times

31:27.640 --> 31:28.544
Yes

31:29.960 --> 31:31.720
Sir, save me

31:32.599 --> 31:33.799
please

31:43.720 --> 31:46.640
Mr. Song, you have some moves

31:49.400 --> 31:50.304
Thank you all

31:52.880 --> 31:54.759
Do you just want to?

31:55.359 --> 31:56.839
for r

31:56.839 --> 31:59.359
How do you deal with issues?

31:59.359 --> 32:00.288
not really

32:01.599 --> 32:03.319
There is an old issue for many years

32:03.920 --> 32:05.119
The judge asked me about that

32:06.160 --> 32:07.240
But I didn't know how to respond

32:07.400 --> 32:09.000
That's why I asked you to come

32:10.000 --> 32:11.279
To make another statement

32:12.839 --> 32:15.200
What is the condition?

32:15.440 --> 32:19.400
Two years ago, Mr. Xie seized
a neighbour's land, causing a dispute

32:19.839 --> 32:21.759
Do you remember that?

32:22.319 --> 32:23.519
That case?

32:24.240 --> 32:25.960
Wasn't it already closed?

32:28.079 --> 32:31.519
It was adjudicated personally
by the previous judge

32:31.519 --> 32:32.559
I wasn't involved

32:32.920 --> 32:34.559
That's why I don't know the details

32:36.200 --> 32:38.279
I'll have to ask you about that

32:41.680 --> 32:42.599
Mr. Song

32:44.200 --> 32:47.440
Do you really want to know that?

32:48.759 --> 32:52.160
Or are you curious about another home?

32:56.440 --> 32:57.480
Well both of you

33:00.240 --> 33:02.240
What exactly is going on between you two?

33:03.319 --> 33:05.000
And the dream house
in Yanzi World?

33:05.119 --> 33:07.119
Didn't I tell you before?

33:07.480 --> 33:11.400
I wanted to buy a low cost house
and took note of this house

33:11.400 --> 33:12.960
There are no other reasons

33:12.960 --> 33:13.824
Furthermore it

33:14.480 --> 33:16.160
Mr. Xie bought half a mu
of land from neighbors

33:16.160 --> 33:18.960
At market prices
to extend his home two years ago

33:19.519 --> 33:21.440
We have a contract and a sponsor

33:21.720 --> 33:23.880
Later, I thought the neighbors
sold it too cheaply

33:23.880 --> 33:25.240
So he sued Mr. Xie

33:25.359 --> 33:27.519
The previous judge
made a clear ruling

33:27.519 --> 33:29.279
Mr. Shaw won the case

33:29.440 --> 33:31.200
Even if it's to a different judge

33:31.200 --> 33:33.119
I will say the same thing

33:38.200 --> 33:40.359
If you are not satisfied

33:42.640 --> 33:43.559
Please

33:43.559 --> 33:46.119
By removing the skin from me

33:46.119 --> 33:47.599
I'm very curious

33:47.599 --> 33:50.720
About the size of my skin

33:56.200 --> 33:57.480
Mr. Zhang

33:58.599 --> 33:59.759
You are so bold

34:06.960 --> 34:10.159
I am Mr. Xie's servant

34:10.280 --> 34:13.199
Although my skin is not worth much

34:13.559 --> 34:15.920
You can't take it away from me

34:15.920 --> 34:18.320
As you intended
for that peasant

34:25.199 --> 34:27.199
Well, you can come back

34:29.760 --> 34:31.239
Send my regards to Mr. Xie

34:42.239 --> 34:44.760
I'll leave first

35:10.112 --> 35:12.988
(Talisman)

35:21.360 --> 35:22.336
my lord

35:23.320 --> 35:24.480
What did you just order?

35:25.360 --> 35:26.208
Mr. Wang

35:26.679 --> 35:28.239
What were they just picking up?

35:29.199 --> 35:30.119
Telezman

35:30.400 --> 35:31.599
the song?

35:32.639 --> 35:33.480
For any reason?

35:34.480 --> 35:37.480
There have been murders occurring
consecutively

35:37.880 --> 35:39.960
And he was hanging

35:39.960 --> 35:41.280
on the bridge

35:41.920 --> 35:43.480
There are rumours

35:43.480 --> 35:46.119
That Demon Ape
committed these killings

35:46.920 --> 35:47.960
With the story on your plate

35:48.199 --> 35:50.639
The monkey demon will not cause trouble

35:50.760 --> 35:51.719
Monkey demon?

35:53.480 --> 35:54.480
What kind of monkey demon?

36:00.800 --> 36:01.696
my lord

36:02.280 --> 36:05.480
I don't know anything
about the monkey demon

36:06.360 --> 36:08.480
Many people said they saw a big monkey

36:08.679 --> 36:10.679
Fishing for the moon

36:10.800 --> 36:12.400
In the river in the middle of the night

36:12.880 --> 36:14.320
Do you think so?

36:14.719 --> 36:16.480
It doesn't matter

36:16.840 --> 36:20.400
Anyway, one man
only costs five copper coins

36:20.679 --> 36:21.632
Five copper coins?

36:22.280 --> 36:24.079
Where can i buy one

36:24.239 --> 36:26.639
If you want one, I can give you one

36:26.719 --> 36:28.000
Just take it

36:28.000 --> 36:29.719
How can I accept this?

36:29.719 --> 36:32.800
No problem

36:44.360 --> 36:45.280
my lord

36:47.360 --> 36:49.480
Let's go to work

36:49.480 --> 36:52.599
I lost 23 pieces of jewelry

36:52.800 --> 36:53.760
exactly

36:54.840 --> 36:57.079
The items were locked
in the closet in the bedroom

36:57.239 --> 36:59.639
After they went to sleep that night

36:59.639 --> 37:01.280
You didn't hear any unusual sounds

37:01.440 --> 37:03.159
But the next morning, I found out

37:03.159 --> 37:06.119
The lock had been broken
and the items had been put back

37:07.239 --> 37:09.440
Yes, this is very strange

37:10.360 --> 37:13.360
Did the neighbors hear anything unusual?

37:16.480 --> 37:17.840
Who lives next to you?

37:17.840 --> 37:19.159
On the west side he lives

37:19.360 --> 37:22.760
Lu family
carpentry shop owner

37:23.199 --> 37:25.480
And the eastern side lives a world

37:25.639 --> 37:27.159
He lives with his mother

37:27.159 --> 37:28.039
Tao

37:28.559 --> 37:31.000
Mr. Tao, Tao Huyun

37:33.039 --> 37:35.599
I hear you and Mr. Lu's house

37:35.599 --> 37:37.000
He belonged to the Tao family

37:37.280 --> 37:40.360
But Tao Hyun is a spendthrift

37:41.000 --> 37:42.719
He sold his property

37:43.639 --> 37:44.840
Mr. Tao

37:45.079 --> 37:45.952
permission

37:46.800 --> 37:48.199
good man

37:48.679 --> 37:51.199
But he likes to gamble
on cricket fights

37:52.119 --> 37:53.000
Cricket fight?

37:53.559 --> 37:55.920
Are you usually associated with Mr. Tao?

37:56.480 --> 38:00.280
Do you doubt Mr. Tao?

38:01.119 --> 38:02.519
Not possible

38:02.760 --> 38:04.239
Mr. Tao

38:04.239 --> 38:06.719
It's just a nice world

38:06.719 --> 38:08.559
Weak like a lady

38:09.079 --> 38:10.840
If he wants to break it for theft

38:10.840 --> 38:13.320
I think he can't even climb a wall

38:14.559 --> 38:15.488
Mr. Wang

38:16.199 --> 38:18.079
permission

38:18.800 --> 38:21.679
Do you always check your jewelry?

38:24.159 --> 38:25.039
Jewelry is

38:26.840 --> 38:28.760
for women

38:28.760 --> 38:31.320
Why should I check it?

38:31.639 --> 38:33.159
Let me leave the topic for a moment

38:35.800 --> 38:37.880
Heard from your neighbors

38:38.079 --> 38:40.119
That Mr. Tai often visited your house

38:44.639 --> 38:46.039
The store is closed, Mr. Wang

38:51.159 --> 38:52.096
Mr. Wang

38:52.880 --> 38:54.800
Take a look at this gold hairpin

38:55.199 --> 38:56.559
Is he the one you lost?

38:58.760 --> 39:02.000
According to the case file,
he lost a new pearl he owned

39:02.400 --> 39:04.159
Later, a garden was attached to it

39:04.599 --> 39:05.504
Where did you find it?

39:06.599 --> 39:07.880
Did you find this hairpin?

39:09.320 --> 39:10.320
Tianshun Store

39:12.960 --> 39:14.039
It's just near your home

39:16.480 --> 39:17.599
His pawns were Mr. Tao

39:22.000 --> 39:24.400
Other positions I lost were also found

39:24.840 --> 39:26.039
In that workshop

39:26.760 --> 39:29.800
They had all been pawns of Mr. Tao
in the past six months

39:30.119 --> 39:31.008
permission

39:32.480 --> 39:33.679
And I can't believe it

39:33.679 --> 39:35.960
That Mr. Tao can climb your wall

39:36.599 --> 39:37.760
I will assume

39:39.079 --> 39:41.119
He entered your house
through the doorway

39:43.760 --> 39:44.960
So

39:46.559 --> 39:47.719
It's an inside job

39:48.880 --> 39:49.824
Mr. Wang

39:50.639 --> 39:52.119
Occasionally

39:52.800 --> 39:54.159
Can't lock

39:56.039 --> 39:57.280
Keep a woman's things safe

40:18.440 --> 40:19.280
I will release the fee

40:21.400 --> 40:22.240
my lord

40:22.440 --> 40:25.504
I mean, I'll withdraw the case

40:25.599 --> 40:26.464
Mr. Wang

40:27.079 --> 40:28.840
I understand

40:29.199 --> 40:30.760
This is shameful

40:30.880 --> 40:32.320
But Yemen

40:32.320 --> 40:35.440
You will not be allowed
to drop a case as you wish

40:35.440 --> 40:36.599
Especially this type of issue

40:36.599 --> 40:37.800
He's a researcher

40:38.039 --> 40:39.400
Even if you really want to withdraw it

40:39.760 --> 40:42.360
You must provide a statement
to explain the whole thing

40:43.400 --> 40:46.039
Then
I have to arrest your wife and Mr. Tao

40:46.039 --> 40:47.400
Yamin will relieve him of his title

40:47.599 --> 40:48.760
If you don't follow through

40:49.000 --> 40:50.519
They can be given lenient punishment

40:51.519 --> 40:52.519
Sir, I beg you

40:53.599 --> 40:54.496
my lord

40:55.079 --> 40:58.079
I beg you

41:02.599 --> 41:04.440
Huiwin is innocent

41:04.440 --> 41:06.039
This is all my fault

41:07.000 --> 41:07.968
Mr. Wang

41:09.159 --> 41:10.199
stand up

41:10.800 --> 41:12.039
I do not understand what you mean

41:12.800 --> 41:13.696
my lord

41:14.039 --> 41:16.159
I just wanted to help him

41:16.480 --> 41:17.408
but

41:17.840 --> 41:21.599
I'm afraid to let my wife find out

41:23.039 --> 41:26.519
Her parents own this store

41:26.920 --> 41:28.960
I can't let her know

41:29.960 --> 41:32.519
She said that day
she wanted to visit her mother

41:33.480 --> 41:36.199
I knew she was going to wear jewelry

41:36.199 --> 41:38.320
This way, you will know
the jewelry has been stolen

41:38.320 --> 41:39.519
sir

41:40.280 --> 41:41.152
Mr. Wang

41:41.599 --> 41:43.000
do you say

41:43.400 --> 41:45.000
That you gave me the jewelry for Mr. Tao?

41:45.519 --> 41:48.480
Yes, I gave it

41:52.039 --> 41:54.440
So you are a friend of Mr. Tao?

42:02.440 --> 42:03.280
Get up, please

42:15.639 --> 42:17.480
I'll act as if I found
nothing in this case

42:17.568 --> 42:18.480
Thanks...

42:18.480 --> 42:19.456
Don't kneel

42:22.079 --> 42:23.072
do not do

42:25.039 --> 42:26.280
I'm not done yet

42:27.880 --> 42:29.119
I don't help for free

42:29.679 --> 42:32.119
You're buying me some medicine
to heal my wounds

42:33.400 --> 42:35.639
I will buy you the best

42:38.599 --> 42:39.584
Buy more

42:42.800 --> 42:43.679
For five people

42:48.400 --> 42:50.880
(Talisman)
Under the protection of the Guardian Gods

42:51.079 --> 42:53.760
Evil spirits must be repelled

42:59.719 --> 43:01.400
The monkey demon is very powerful

43:01.760 --> 43:04.320
Can storytelling be effective?

43:04.920 --> 43:08.039
You can put more on your door

43:11.320 --> 43:14.159
Why is there a palm bouquet
on your deck?

43:14.679 --> 43:15.584
Ah...

43:16.320 --> 43:17.920
This is the Palm Buddha tournament

43:17.920 --> 43:19.840
It means the demon of the monkeys

43:19.840 --> 43:21.639
There is no escape from Buddha's walk

43:21.639 --> 43:22.840
Am i right?

43:23.800 --> 43:25.360
Yes you are

43:25.960 --> 43:27.199
I heard stories from messengers

43:28.079 --> 43:29.599
Mr. Feng, will you stick that
to your door?

43:30.400 --> 43:31.760
Do not focus on the evil spirit

43:32.000 --> 43:33.679
I don't believe in that

43:34.480 --> 43:36.159
One fox costs five copper coins

43:36.159 --> 43:37.360
I bought a fig

43:37.360 --> 43:38.559
That's all I can afford

43:38.559 --> 43:39.599
I won't spend more

43:40.280 --> 43:42.000
I don't believe in any monkey demons

43:43.239 --> 43:44.519
Mr. Feng, Xisong

43:44.880 --> 43:45.760
Mrs. Chi

43:46.079 --> 43:47.079
Jerry

43:47.400 --> 43:48.960
Sangang I woke up and stuff

43:49.920 --> 43:51.679
I'm going to Yamin tomorrow

43:53.239 --> 43:55.800
Sangeng, I'm here to tell you

43:56.119 --> 43:57.599
If Ling Rui asks you to help him fight

43:57.599 --> 43:58.559
You shouldn't listen to him

43:59.679 --> 44:01.239
Roy quarreled?

44:01.239 --> 44:03.239
With a child of Mr. Liu,
the owner of the woodworking shop

44:03.239 --> 44:04.360
Roy lost

44:04.840 --> 44:07.239
He said he asked for your help
to take revenge on him

44:07.239 --> 44:08.440
Don't worry

44:08.440 --> 44:09.519
I am a grown man

44:09.519 --> 44:11.159
How can I help a child fight?

44:11.559 --> 44:13.599
I know, but I'm afraid

44:13.719 --> 44:15.480
If Rue bothers you, you will crave

44:15.480 --> 44:16.360
Don't worry

44:16.639 --> 44:17.880
If he really comes to me

44:18.000 --> 44:20.119
I'll teach him a lesson

44:21.199 --> 44:22.144
Good

44:23.079 --> 44:26.079
I am very familiar with Mr. Liu

44:26.320 --> 44:27.719
I'll complain to him about that

44:27.920 --> 44:29.280
Mr. Liu

44:29.280 --> 44:30.679
He beat his son harder than me

44:32.800 --> 44:35.199
Sangeng, you have to be quick

44:35.199 --> 44:37.239
Mr. Liu is very superstitious
about the monkey demons

44:37.239 --> 44:39.000
His shop closes early every day now

44:39.000 --> 44:40.920
All doors
and windows are fascinated by stories

44:41.480 --> 44:43.119
She is increasingly admired

44:43.599 --> 44:44.840
Don't you believe it, Miss Ling?

44:45.360 --> 44:46.304
I do not believe that

44:47.639 --> 44:50.119
Li Tiezui on Xianjing Street
also sells charms

44:50.119 --> 44:52.239
But he drew golden pens on his magic

44:52.440 --> 44:53.312
permission

44:53.840 --> 44:56.719
Guan Yun placed the golden dove
on Sun and Kong's head

44:56.719 --> 44:58.679
But I painted Buddha's palm

44:59.000 --> 45:00.119
Guanyin and Tathagata

45:00.119 --> 45:01.056
which one is bigger?

45:01.056 --> 45:03.119
(sly line and flaps)

45:03.119 --> 45:05.119
You have some moves

45:05.400 --> 45:06.272
naturally

45:09.119 --> 45:10.119
Another question

45:10.679 --> 45:11.920
What is the source of the monkey?

45:11.920 --> 45:13.400
Why did he come here?

45:13.800 --> 45:15.079
Let me tell you

45:15.800 --> 45:17.679
This monkey demon is here
to seek revenge

45:19.599 --> 45:20.800
No revenge

45:21.559 --> 45:24.119
General, the monkey trainer came here

45:24.119 --> 45:25.280
Eat a little monkey

45:25.880 --> 45:28.840
The private school teacher Mr. Wang
encouraged Captain Lang

45:28.840 --> 45:30.440
To kill that little monkey

45:33.639 --> 45:34.559
Yes

45:34.559 --> 45:35.400
I remember now

45:35.400 --> 45:37.039
This happened

45:38.079 --> 45:39.280
People talk about the monkey demon

45:39.280 --> 45:40.679
for some reason

45:41.039 --> 45:42.440
My teacher once told me a case

45:42.440 --> 45:44.800
About the monkey

45:46.239 --> 45:47.199
I heard that from my mom

45:47.519 --> 45:48.920
My uncle stopped at that time

45:50.119 --> 45:51.679
- Mr. Wang?
- Mr. Wang?

45:53.408 --> 45:56.832
(20 years ago)

46:04.079 --> 46:04.960
good

46:11.360 --> 46:13.039
amazing

46:13.039 --> 46:14.440
What's cool?

46:14.440 --> 46:15.719
What a smart monkey

46:19.599 --> 46:20.639
Mr. Wang is here

46:20.639 --> 46:21.360
Run

46:21.360 --> 46:22.800
how dare you?

46:24.159 --> 46:25.840
Go back to school

46:26.304 --> 46:27.280
there

46:27.280 --> 46:28.480
Mr. Wang is here

46:28.480 --> 46:30.320
Go back to school

46:30.639 --> 46:31.616
Go back to school

46:32.280 --> 46:33.184
to stop

46:35.039 --> 46:36.000
you are a thief

46:36.000 --> 46:37.880
counting

46:41.639 --> 46:43.239
You, little boy

46:43.480 --> 46:44.352
counting

46:47.360 --> 46:48.239
my lord

46:48.719 --> 46:50.039
What do you do?

46:50.400 --> 46:53.039
My students

46:54.000 --> 46:54.920
Miss class

46:54.920 --> 46:57.840
To watch your reading

46:58.519 --> 46:59.880
I pushed the kids away

47:00.159 --> 47:01.840
And also other spectators

47:02.440 --> 47:03.760
I can't make any money now

47:03.760 --> 47:05.639
- Yes
- True

47:06.000 --> 47:07.360
I do not blame you

47:07.360 --> 47:09.760
But why do you blame me?

47:09.920 --> 47:11.519
You are to blame, of course

47:12.159 --> 47:14.400
You must be reasonable

47:14.840 --> 47:16.519
- Exactly
- Yes

47:17.239 --> 47:18.320
Be reasonable

47:18.760 --> 47:21.719
They are still here

47:22.280 --> 47:24.400
I also watched your monkey show

47:24.400 --> 47:25.280
You...

47:26.079 --> 47:28.079
You should ask them for money

47:29.639 --> 47:30.624
Get out of here

47:34.280 --> 47:35.599
Everyone is gone

47:45.559 --> 47:47.400
There are some
who haven't left yet

47:48.159 --> 47:50.199
I will ask for money on your behalf

47:55.559 --> 47:56.440
it's over

47:56.440 --> 47:57.440
Yes

47:58.320 --> 47:59.264
permission

48:00.559 --> 48:03.679
Have you watched the monkey show?

48:05.239 --> 48:06.112
Yes

48:07.159 --> 48:08.064
That's the thing

48:08.679 --> 48:11.199
He worked for a long time

48:11.320 --> 48:14.039
You can't watch for free, right?

48:14.360 --> 48:15.296
can you

48:17.239 --> 48:18.360
To give him some money?

48:20.000 --> 48:21.039
the money?

48:22.360 --> 48:23.200
Good

48:28.719 --> 48:30.480
get out from here

48:31.960 --> 48:33.159
Don't ruin my mood

48:33.159 --> 48:34.159
What?

48:34.159 --> 48:36.239
Aren't you going to pay him money?

48:37.159 --> 48:38.320
Did I say I'd give him the money?

48:38.679 --> 48:40.559
His monkey show wasn't good

48:40.679 --> 48:41.632
permission

48:42.199 --> 48:43.760
What do you mean?

48:46.519 --> 48:47.559
This money

48:49.599 --> 48:51.679
It is my share for you

48:53.599 --> 48:55.079
Advice for me?

48:55.760 --> 48:56.704
Yes

48:56.880 --> 48:58.239
You did better than that monkey

48:58.239 --> 48:59.104
You...

49:01.519 --> 49:02.480
Young man

49:03.199 --> 49:04.160
You...

49:04.960 --> 49:07.519
How can you be so rude?

49:08.639 --> 49:10.760
It's interesting
to see a teacher

49:10.960 --> 49:12.320
Make a scene

49:15.639 --> 49:16.599
Have you seen this before?

49:16.800 --> 49:17.719
- No
- No

49:17.719 --> 49:18.719
Want to watch it again?

49:18.719 --> 49:19.880
- Yes, we will
- Yes, yes

49:22.920 --> 49:23.904
Leading to the monkey

49:24.199 --> 49:25.159
Catch the gong

49:25.679 --> 49:26.639
Let this gentleman

49:26.760 --> 49:27.760
Play with batting

49:29.599 --> 49:30.496
What?

49:31.039 --> 49:32.840
Weren't you just running?

49:33.400 --> 49:34.336
tired?

49:35.239 --> 49:37.320
I'll help you

49:37.960 --> 49:39.039
Run

49:43.480 --> 49:44.800
thus?

49:44.960 --> 49:46.400
Yes, like that

49:46.559 --> 49:47.488
Stranger

49:48.119 --> 49:49.000
So, Mr. Wang

49:49.000 --> 49:51.079
He didn't fight with that monkey performer

49:52.000 --> 49:53.280
Fight against that gift

49:53.280 --> 49:55.239
Is Mr. Wang so sharp?

49:56.000 --> 49:57.119
This is my uncle

49:57.719 --> 49:59.360
He seems polite and nice

49:59.639 --> 50:00.840
But once he gets angry

50:00.840 --> 50:02.960
He will get angry

50:03.199 --> 50:04.880
My mother told me his name was

50:04.880 --> 50:05.792
It was Donnie Wang

50:06.920 --> 50:07.808
to stop

50:08.039 --> 50:08.920
What do you do?

50:09.039 --> 50:09.920
Get out of the way

50:10.199 --> 50:12.519
- Get up - Come on
- Move

50:14.320 --> 50:15.840
Mr. Wang?

50:16.079 --> 50:17.199
Why are you fighting?

50:18.400 --> 50:19.440
Who are you hitting?

50:19.559 --> 50:21.719
Shi Liu from Zhaofengli

50:22.159 --> 50:23.000
What is Liu?

50:23.960 --> 50:24.896
It can't be like that

50:25.000 --> 50:26.159
I know Shi Liu

50:26.320 --> 50:27.199
Yes

50:27.199 --> 50:29.519
I'm Shi Liu

50:30.360 --> 50:31.200
Ah...

50:34.400 --> 50:35.392
do not move

50:36.360 --> 50:37.639
Your case has been saved

50:38.880 --> 50:41.440
Why did Captain Leng
catch the monkey's performance?

50:42.079 --> 50:43.559
He was a thief

50:44.280 --> 50:46.920
Make a monkey show during the day

50:46.920 --> 50:48.199
And he started stealing monkeys at night

50:49.119 --> 50:50.719
How do monkeys steal things?

50:51.360 --> 50:52.440
It was summer

50:53.039 --> 50:54.880
People sleep
with the windows open at night

50:55.280 --> 50:57.960
The monkey crept into the bedroom
of rich families

50:57.960 --> 51:00.360
To steal the jewelry
on the dressing table

51:00.800 --> 51:03.000
How did Captain Lang solve the case?

51:03.320 --> 51:05.760
A lady forgot to close her powder box

51:06.039 --> 51:07.320
The wind blows at night

51:07.800 --> 51:09.159
The powder fell everywhere on the table

51:10.800 --> 51:12.679
The white prints of the monkeys were left behind

51:13.519 --> 51:14.920
what is the result?

51:15.239 --> 51:16.128
as a result

51:16.920 --> 51:18.679
The monkey performer
was beaten sixty times

51:18.679 --> 51:20.599
He was seriously injured
but he did not have money for treatment

51:20.760 --> 51:23.519
He died in a broken brick kiln
outside the city

51:24.440 --> 51:25.480
Monkey performer

51:25.480 --> 51:27.760
I tricked this little monkey down
the mountain

51:28.119 --> 51:30.719
He must be the descendant
of the Demon Ape

51:30.719 --> 51:32.920
The monkey demon is here to take revenge on him

51:33.239 --> 51:35.960
So I killed Captain Leng and Mr. Wang

51:39.079 --> 51:41.920
So, what about the basic structure
attached to the bridge?

51:41.920 --> 51:43.239
