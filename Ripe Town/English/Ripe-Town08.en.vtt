00:46.320 --> 00:52.880
(Go get Lu Che)

00:53.439 --> 00:54.400
Yes

01:45.439 --> 01:51.959
(You shouldn't involve him)

02:04.040 --> 02:04.920
Thank you, Mr. Zhong

02:06.280 --> 02:07.280
And Mr. Yu

02:18.319 --> 02:23.080
(He stays here to heal)

02:27.919 --> 02:28.768
Mr. Zhong

02:30.199 --> 02:31.879
What should we do with these two bodies?

02:38.919 --> 02:39.879
(permission)

02:39.879 --> 02:41.879
(Bodies in the distance)

02:41.879 --> 02:44.280
(Tonight)

02:44.280 --> 02:45.120
Yes

02:46.759 --> 02:50.680
(Put some valuables)

02:50.680 --> 02:53.680
(on their bodies)

03:03.280 --> 03:07.120
(Go get another knife)

03:15.599 --> 03:16.639
Are you trying to pretend?

03:16.639 --> 03:18.560
They stole things and ran away

03:19.319 --> 03:20.560
Then they fought

03:21.680 --> 03:23.400
And they killed each other over the spoils?

04:48.512 --> 04:52.352
=Riba Town
===Episode 8=

04:53.439 --> 04:55.920
(D-1609)
(Once Zheng's death certificate came)

04:56.160 --> 04:59.000
(Captain Xia's lie)
about the monkey demon being exposed

04:59.560 --> 05:01.959
(The Inspector General is said to
have been angry)

05:02.040 --> 05:03.279
Come on, one on one

05:05.600 --> 05:08.839
Xiao Jia, don't think
we're teasing you with numbers

05:08.839 --> 05:10.920
You deserve it

05:11.560 --> 05:13.319
She hit us several times with the bulletin board

05:13.600 --> 05:15.199
Now we'll quickly get back to it

05:15.720 --> 05:19.079
Be smart, now get off
and lie down

05:19.480 --> 05:20.680
- Lie down
- Take off your pants

05:20.680 --> 05:22.680
The Inspector General
is truly merciless

05:22.879 --> 05:25.240
In fact, he demoted Xia
to ordinary guard

05:25.879 --> 05:27.439
And send it here

05:28.279 --> 05:29.240
This won't help

05:31.040 --> 05:32.000
What?

05:33.639 --> 05:36.279
- get down!
- get down!

05:36.279 --> 05:38.959
Listen to me guys, okay?

05:46.360 --> 05:48.040
Of all his enemies

05:48.920 --> 05:50.399
I should hate him more than most

05:51.680 --> 05:52.560
I look forward to

05:52.560 --> 05:54.560
Seeing you beat him to death here

05:56.160 --> 05:57.152
you guys

05:57.800 --> 06:00.759
Let's just kill him here today

06:01.160 --> 06:02.480
What do you think that?

06:03.120 --> 06:04.600
Sangeng, just talk straight

06:07.199 --> 06:08.096
Jain

06:08.800 --> 06:10.839
If you want
to beat him to death today

06:11.279 --> 06:12.600
Regardless of the consequences

06:13.079 --> 06:15.120
I'll be the first to
hit him with the plate

06:16.480 --> 06:17.472
But

06:18.519 --> 06:20.279
I feel like it's not worth it

06:20.279 --> 06:21.879
Get involved in a lawsuit
and lose our jobs

06:23.000 --> 06:24.120
For his cheap life

06:24.800 --> 06:26.160
We just want to blow

06:26.560 --> 06:27.879
Why do we beat him to death?

06:28.319 --> 06:30.120
If you all hurry up
and hit him together

06:30.480 --> 06:31.600
How can he survive?

06:37.680 --> 06:38.592
but

06:39.839 --> 06:41.600
If you don't want to kill him

06:42.079 --> 06:43.079
And I just want to breathe

06:44.399 --> 06:45.720
I have a way

06:47.839 --> 06:48.720
Which way?

06:49.360 --> 06:50.639
We all know well in our hearts

06:50.639 --> 06:52.839
How many strikes do we owe

06:53.839 --> 06:55.279
Let's observe them one by one

06:55.279 --> 06:56.560
Then arrange it

06:56.879 --> 06:58.480
And hit him every now and then

06:59.879 --> 07:01.519
Be careful not to beat him to death

07:01.839 --> 07:03.680
This way
it will take a few months

07:03.680 --> 07:05.040
Or a few years

07:05.680 --> 07:06.720
His butts are going to be sore

07:07.199 --> 07:08.439
Sticks to your pants every day

07:08.519 --> 07:09.759
But he cannot sit in a chair

07:10.399 --> 07:11.759
I wish he was dead

07:12.199 --> 07:13.759
But we will not be responsible

07:14.279 --> 07:15.160
Gentlemen

07:15.680 --> 07:17.759
Is this acceptable?

07:18.160 --> 07:19.104
good

07:19.959 --> 07:22.759
I agree with Sangeng's idea

07:23.560 --> 07:25.720
Guys, what do you think?

07:26.000 --> 07:28.120
- That's good
- Let's do as Sangig says

07:29.319 --> 07:30.959
If you all agree

07:31.319 --> 07:33.319
I will be the registrar

07:33.759 --> 07:36.439
Guys, come with me to the inspection unit
to report the number

07:36.608 --> 07:37.480
Let's go

07:37.480 --> 07:38.759
- Let's go
- Go

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Can you walk?

07:56.399 --> 07:57.248
To you

08:03.279 --> 08:04.128
with the

08:06.279 --> 08:07.168
This is it

08:09.639 --> 08:11.199
Our last drink together

08:13.279 --> 08:14.199
After drinking it

08:15.160 --> 08:16.480
We will cut ties

08:17.399 --> 08:19.959
So you won't get involved with me

08:20.736 --> 08:21.664
we...

08:21.664 --> 08:22.800
We gathered

08:23.399 --> 08:24.399
We should leave together

08:27.040 --> 08:27.959
You did me a favor

08:29.399 --> 08:33.120
Let's not talk about that

08:43.879 --> 08:44.799
sorry for disturbing you

08:45.279 --> 08:46.840
Can't you wait for one night?

08:49.200 --> 08:50.320
I've waited for a long time

08:52.240 --> 08:53.080
Captain Shea

08:53.759 --> 08:56.440
There's something
that you have to get back to me

09:01.824 --> 09:04.128
(Chief Bailey of Dou District)

09:06.519 --> 09:07.424
ko chewi

09:08.879 --> 09:09.799
I did it on purpose

09:10.960 --> 09:12.360
You knew the killer would come back

09:12.720 --> 09:14.240
They deliberately tempted me
to take that badge

09:14.440 --> 09:15.759
And framing the monkey demon

09:16.000 --> 09:17.759
So I fell big

09:21.320 --> 09:23.840
Jane counted
the beating she deserved

09:24.879 --> 09:26.759
It's rounded to 750

09:28.399 --> 09:29.240
are you scared?

09:31.799 --> 09:32.768
I'll take half of that

09:35.679 --> 09:36.559
Captain Shea

09:38.480 --> 09:39.440
are you scared?

09:43.159 --> 09:44.032
Yes

09:44.759 --> 09:46.480
You beat everyone before

09:47.480 --> 09:49.279
Just to scare us

09:50.519 --> 09:52.879
Now we're back to you again

09:53.519 --> 09:54.519
And you are afraid

09:55.360 --> 09:56.704
But, Captain Shea

09:56.704 --> 09:59.960
We should not have fear
in the hearts of our people

10:00.960 --> 10:01.856
It's the criminals

10:02.960 --> 10:05.120
Who should be terrified of us

10:18.279 --> 10:20.600
I can spare you the 750 hit

10:20.840 --> 10:22.360
One hit for a mound of silver

10:23.440 --> 10:25.960
Pay them in money

10:27.360 --> 10:29.720
Captain Shea, 750 taels of silver

10:30.120 --> 10:31.240
You can have it, right?

10:34.759 --> 10:36.360
Even if I had to sell everything

10:37.240 --> 10:38.679
I must get it

10:38.960 --> 10:40.120
Will they agree?

10:40.639 --> 10:41.759
You are also a security officer

10:42.840 --> 10:44.559
Do you think they will agree?

10:50.679 --> 10:51.679
Sorry to bother you both

10:52.679 --> 10:53.559
I'm leaving

10:55.960 --> 10:56.864
Wait a minute

11:07.879 --> 11:08.736
Ko Sangg

11:11.000 --> 11:11.960
I really don't know

11:13.000 --> 11:14.080
Whether I hate you

11:17.279 --> 11:18.279
Or thank you

11:43.240 --> 11:44.080
Ko Sanqing

11:45.759 --> 11:47.240
I have learned

11:48.279 --> 11:49.759
Captain Ling means excellently

11:50.120 --> 11:51.879
Mr. Song, it's too late.
You've been working so hard

11:52.519 --> 11:53.519
Not as hard as you

11:56.120 --> 11:57.120
Captain Shea

11:57.360 --> 11:58.272
you kiding me

11:58.840 --> 12:00.120
Now I'm just a guard

12:00.879 --> 12:01.759
I feel sorry for you

12:02.519 --> 12:03.840
Working in the days

12:04.480 --> 12:06.440
One must always learn to be flexible

12:13.000 --> 12:13.960
both of you

12:14.559 --> 12:16.559
No need to attend
those regular duties in the future

12:17.279 --> 12:18.360
Just follow me

12:23.879 --> 12:25.399
Thank you, Mr. Song

12:25.759 --> 12:27.399
We feel free to have us in the future

12:28.519 --> 12:33.639
We will do whatever you want us to do

12:35.240 --> 12:36.128
Good

12:41.600 --> 12:42.592
Lee San

12:44.360 --> 12:47.519
I heard you're an expert at shopping

12:48.360 --> 12:49.320
And secret investigations

12:50.840 --> 12:52.080
I come from the streets

12:52.720 --> 12:54.000
Those stupid tricks

12:54.320 --> 12:55.296
It's second nature to me

12:57.360 --> 12:58.240
This is good

12:59.320 --> 13:00.160
permission

13:01.000 --> 13:04.799
You are watching someone

13:07.200 --> 13:08.640
(killer letters)

13:10.200 --> 13:11.168
Mr. Feng

13:13.320 --> 13:14.304
Feng...

13:15.879 --> 13:16.832
do not move

13:19.399 --> 13:20.240
Found it

13:21.279 --> 13:22.120
Found what?

13:24.240 --> 13:25.240
A guide to the killer

13:26.519 --> 13:27.360
Any evidence?

13:28.120 --> 13:29.440
Evidence that the killer was killed

13:30.120 --> 13:31.399
It lies in these words

13:33.399 --> 13:35.639
In these words?

13:39.039 --> 13:41.919
The killer leaves classical Chinese

13:41.919 --> 13:42.960
Every time he kills someone

13:43.759 --> 13:46.559
This shows that it is fragrant

13:48.000 --> 13:48.879
Good stage

13:51.240 --> 13:52.320
I had a feeling at the time

13:52.320 --> 13:54.879
He must have left porridge
with those words

13:56.559 --> 13:57.504
trouble

14:00.120 --> 14:01.840
(Unified Principle)
It is from Chapter Four

14:02.399 --> 14:04.159
(Youth)
This is from Chapter Eleven

14:04.159 --> 14:05.519
Chapter Nine

14:05.519 --> 14:07.328
(Such a person could be exposed to such a disease)
Chapter Six

14:10.720 --> 14:12.399
Did you get anything?

14:17.200 --> 14:18.120
Think again

14:18.279 --> 14:20.399
Türkiye, you just said that

14:22.519 --> 14:24.080
4 plus 11 equals 15

14:24.080 --> 14:25.960
9 plus 6 also equals 15

14:27.440 --> 14:28.384
correct

14:28.960 --> 14:30.600
so what?

14:31.440 --> 14:32.384
Chapter fifteen

14:32.679 --> 14:34.080
He is "Duke Ling of Wei"

14:35.039 --> 14:36.200
I thought it was the beginning

14:36.480 --> 14:38.000
The first sentence of the chapter

14:38.000 --> 14:40.559
On Duke Ling of Wei's question
to Confucius about military formations

14:40.799 --> 14:41.919
What does it mean?

14:42.559 --> 14:43.520
nothing

14:43.679 --> 14:44.919
So it has nothing to do with it

14:45.519 --> 14:47.240
But it has nothing to do with
Duke Ling of Wei

14:48.200 --> 14:50.320
The capital of the Wei state was Beiyang

14:50.879 --> 14:54.120
Beiyang is now in Henan

14:56.360 --> 14:57.280
So

14:57.799 --> 14:59.840
So the killer tells us

15:00.120 --> 15:01.399
Hey, I'm here

15:07.679 --> 15:10.039
Shichong, Bo Bi

15:10.039 --> 15:12.399
To anyone on the street who speaks
with a Hina accent

15:17.360 --> 15:18.336
Mr. Feng

15:21.480 --> 15:23.080
Haven't you been sleeping well lately?

15:29.759 --> 15:31.519
Do you think
I talk in my sleep?

15:34.799 --> 15:35.712
Türkiye

15:36.919 --> 15:38.200
This is not the correct way

15:40.080 --> 15:41.480
To find evidence to solve a case

15:44.320 --> 15:45.480
He has dispelled all the evidence

15:45.840 --> 15:47.919
Tell me how we should find the evidence

15:49.440 --> 15:50.799
You three came early

15:54.519 --> 15:55.480
Jerry

15:56.080 --> 15:57.360
What did you ask us?

15:57.360 --> 15:58.600
To meet here?

15:58.600 --> 16:00.320
Was Mr. Feng right?

16:01.320 --> 16:02.559
Once Dr. Cheng died

16:02.759 --> 16:04.799
We were at a dead end

16:06.879 --> 16:08.320
All we can be sure of now

16:09.279 --> 16:10.600
It is the deaths of these men

16:10.600 --> 16:12.600
They are all connected to
the Lu family 20 years ago

16:12.799 --> 16:14.000
In that big fire

16:14.360 --> 16:16.159
Everyone in the Lu family
was burned to death

16:16.159 --> 16:17.879
Even inheritance

16:17.879 --> 16:20.159
And the survivors disappeared

16:20.559 --> 16:23.080
It must have been
my father who intervened

16:24.480 --> 16:26.720
What if the rest of them were alive
except for Chen Wang

16:27.480 --> 16:30.000
Those who have already died
are still in Do County

16:30.480 --> 16:33.120
But under a different guise?

16:34.039 --> 16:35.120
the driver

16:35.840 --> 16:37.519
The guard and the cook

16:38.240 --> 16:40.000
They are bound to be familiar faces in this county

16:40.000 --> 16:41.279
It is not easy for them to hide

16:41.480 --> 16:42.639
Maybe they can do it well

16:44.600 --> 16:45.504
By changing their names

16:46.480 --> 16:48.840
The former chef
is now a nicer guy

16:48.840 --> 16:50.600
He just had to avoid
seeing old acquaintances

16:51.159 --> 16:53.480
Wasn't the lieutenant already grown?

16:53.480 --> 16:54.919
To an adult?

16:55.120 --> 16:56.759
Whether they stay or go

16:57.039 --> 16:59.519
They must have left some evidence behind

17:00.200 --> 17:02.000
It is impossible for a living person

17:02.000 --> 17:03.399
To disappear into thin air like smoke

17:05.200 --> 17:06.119
Jerry

17:07.240 --> 17:08.319
what do you want to do?

17:10.400 --> 17:11.480
I want to spend some money

17:16.200 --> 17:17.152
Another one escaped

17:21.799 --> 17:23.000
Fishing is really hard

17:23.519 --> 17:24.559
I have no evidence

17:24.920 --> 17:28.519
The important thing is that we are in the light
and the fish are in the dark

17:29.160 --> 17:30.000
No this is not true

17:31.920 --> 17:33.720
We and the fish are in the dark

17:34.079 --> 17:35.559
Just taste in the light

17:40.559 --> 17:41.440
I'll come back

17:41.960 --> 17:42.848
No more hunting?

17:43.640 --> 17:44.512
No more hunting

17:45.119 --> 17:46.200
you have to go

17:47.000 --> 17:48.200
Prepare some bait

18:06.480 --> 18:08.160
Offer a reward to find someone?

18:08.319 --> 18:09.248
Yes

18:09.400 --> 18:11.279
500 taels

18:11.279 --> 18:13.079
For verified information
about survivors

18:13.359 --> 18:14.640
Series of coins

18:14.640 --> 18:16.448
For other useful information
regardless of importance

18:16.799 --> 18:17.839
Under what guise?

18:18.519 --> 18:21.160
Say it's a quest from their families

18:21.400 --> 18:22.960
But 20 years have passed

18:22.960 --> 18:24.039
Who could believe this?

18:24.599 --> 18:25.440
I think it is possible

18:27.319 --> 18:29.519
Whether it is true or not

18:30.000 --> 18:32.839
It will definitely cause
a feeling in Du Province

18:33.359 --> 18:35.400
Just like when you smell
the water when fishing

18:35.960 --> 18:38.240
You have to get the fish
into the moving pond first

18:38.880 --> 18:39.960
Money hint

18:40.200 --> 18:41.599
You might just bring up these old stories

18:41.599 --> 18:42.839
on the roof

18:43.640 --> 18:44.920
If we can't find the evidence

18:44.920 --> 18:46.319
Let the evidence go to us

18:53.599 --> 18:54.560
What is your opinion

18:55.480 --> 18:56.839
I think we can try that

18:57.160 --> 18:58.880
And we already have it

18:58.880 --> 19:00.240
The first few threads

19:00.680 --> 19:02.079
Let's set the location
at Woolley School

19:02.519 --> 19:04.839
I will write a dozen notices
now and publish them

19:05.839 --> 19:06.720
I want to join

19:07.160 --> 19:08.096
- You can't
- You can't

19:10.119 --> 19:11.759
I knew you'd say that

19:11.759 --> 19:12.839
Just because I'm a girl

19:12.839 --> 19:14.400
I can't show up, right?

19:15.119 --> 19:16.079
I have my own way

19:18.279 --> 19:19.232
What is your opinion

19:19.799 --> 19:21.960
No one can know

19:21.960 --> 19:23.279
I'm a girl anymore, right?

19:24.680 --> 19:25.640
Anyone who is not blind

19:25.640 --> 19:27.319
He can tell you are a girl

19:27.640 --> 19:28.640
Even if one is blind

19:28.640 --> 19:30.400
They can tell us by your voice

19:31.400 --> 19:33.920
I don't care
I pay and I have to stay here

19:33.920 --> 19:34.848
Jerry

19:35.480 --> 19:36.799
I have a way

19:57.680 --> 19:58.560
Go first

19:58.759 --> 19:59.744
I?

20:13.079 --> 20:14.640
do you know

20:14.640 --> 20:16.240
Survivors
of the fire 20 years ago?

20:16.680 --> 20:19.039
I knew a maid named Chen Wang

20:20.839 --> 20:21.760
And after that?

20:23.200 --> 20:25.079
He mooned a lot and made a fortune

20:25.319 --> 20:27.519
Bought a house, lost it all

20:27.519 --> 20:29.559
He took on the burden of debt
and finally jumped into the river

20:31.920 --> 20:34.440
Do you always speak very briefly?

20:35.759 --> 20:38.039
That officer told me

20:38.359 --> 20:41.599
He will only pay me
if I keep my explanation succinct

20:42.920 --> 20:43.799
Don't hesitate to say it

20:46.440 --> 20:47.799
Chen Wang

20:47.799 --> 20:49.200
He was not destined to make a fortune

20:49.319 --> 20:51.559
But he was actually a decent gambler

20:51.559 --> 20:53.599
We met at a game

20:54.119 --> 20:57.359
Honestly, I used
to gamble a little when I was young

20:57.599 --> 20:58.920
To gamble

20:58.920 --> 21:00.200
It's all about one's wisdom

21:00.200 --> 21:01.880
And also one's luck

21:02.160 --> 21:03.680
In my younger years, I was smart

21:03.920 --> 21:05.000
But my luck was a bit good

21:05.519 --> 21:07.440
When you are lucky
you should increase your mortgage

21:07.440 --> 21:08.559
When you're not lucky

21:08.559 --> 21:10.279
You should mortgage less than that or not at all

21:10.279 --> 21:12.440
Especially, one should only mortgage one thing

21:12.799 --> 21:14.559
When I bet on others

21:14.559 --> 21:15.920
You can turn your luck around

21:15.920 --> 21:17.440
Enough, give him the money

21:21.000 --> 21:21.856
Wait a minute

21:22.559 --> 21:23.456
Good

21:32.519 --> 21:33.440
Thank you

21:38.200 --> 21:39.079
Thank you

21:39.759 --> 21:40.640
Thank you, Mr

22:41.400 --> 22:42.440
what are you doing here?

22:42.920 --> 22:43.839
By inspiring people

22:45.400 --> 22:46.519
If you will

22:46.920 --> 22:47.839
It requires customers

22:48.559 --> 22:50.160
no one there now

22:51.680 --> 22:52.720
but

22:55.119 --> 22:58.279
They will be here soon

22:59.200 --> 23:00.200
I have proof

23:00.200 --> 23:04.200
- I have proof
- I have proof

23:04.599 --> 23:06.839
- Open the door
- Open the door

23:06.839 --> 23:09.079
- I have proof
- Open the door

23:09.079 --> 23:11.359
- Open the door
- Open the door

23:13.680 --> 23:14.680
They are here

23:16.759 --> 23:17.759
Mr. Feng, what's wrong?

23:17.759 --> 23:18.640
what is wrong?

23:18.640 --> 23:20.119
People who introduce themselves
all stand at the door

23:20.119 --> 23:21.759
I have to write down the numbers.
It's all a mess out there

23:28.079 --> 23:29.839
Sir, buy one for your wife

23:29.839 --> 23:30.816
how much is this

23:31.039 --> 23:31.936
300 copper coins

23:32.039 --> 23:32.880
Forget it

23:32.880 --> 23:34.848
They are very beautiful, buy one

23:38.240 --> 23:42.496
(Kilin Restaurant)

23:45.799 --> 23:46.720
Mr. Zhang

23:47.079 --> 23:48.000
Where is the owner Mr. New?

23:52.640 --> 23:53.536
truly?

23:54.119 --> 23:55.008
Yes

23:55.400 --> 23:56.359
I'll go find him

23:59.440 --> 24:00.440
Mr. Zhang, take care

24:06.119 --> 24:07.200
Delivery from Kelin

24:07.200 --> 24:09.200
Oh my God, you're finally here

24:09.519 --> 24:11.880
Our Boss Chu has been cursing
that you are angry for a long time

24:11.880 --> 24:13.279
You made fun of your boss

24:13.279 --> 24:15.359
And every other ancestor of his

24:15.440 --> 24:17.039
The only ones that have survived
are the Qilin statues

24:17.200 --> 24:18.144
faster

24:19.880 --> 24:21.400
What took you so long?

24:21.680 --> 24:22.880
Did you cook these two dishes?

24:23.079 --> 24:24.920
Harder than your mother
giving birth to her children?

24:25.920 --> 24:27.480
These two dishes require a lot of effort

24:27.480 --> 24:28.720
So why sell it?

24:28.720 --> 24:30.039
Restaurant boss

24:30.039 --> 24:31.880
Must be able to work quickly

24:32.319 --> 24:33.880
Go tell your boss Leo

24:33.880 --> 24:35.440
Customers can't wait

24:35.440 --> 24:37.160
for a bit

24:37.359 --> 24:39.079
When they want to eat and drink

24:39.319 --> 24:40.279
Yes

24:40.559 --> 24:42.279
Today's customer
is a real pain in the neck

24:43.079 --> 24:44.599
You came to our house

24:44.880 --> 24:46.599
And order
the Steamed Pickle Hilsa Herring

24:46.599 --> 24:47.920
And your book, which is fixed with eight appetites

24:48.440 --> 24:50.000
Available only

24:50.000 --> 24:51.640
From your restaurant

24:56.240 --> 24:58.359
Aren't you the owner, Niu Boyan?

24:58.759 --> 25:00.279
How do you get here yourself?

25:03.160 --> 25:06.000
Don't take
what was just said to heart

25:06.359 --> 25:09.519
It is your first time
to come to our Kuihua Tower

25:12.200 --> 25:14.160
That was rude of me

25:14.400 --> 25:16.279
It's okay, Madam Chu

25:17.720 --> 25:19.240
You are the leader

25:19.599 --> 25:21.240
Why deliver orders yourself?

25:21.240 --> 25:22.440
And you wear clothes like this?

25:23.000 --> 25:25.039
We are very busy and short on manpower

25:26.759 --> 25:27.720
Understood

25:29.599 --> 25:33.039
I heard a long time ago that your wife
keeps you to this strict decorum

25:34.160 --> 25:36.240
So you never
dare to come to places like ours

25:37.039 --> 25:40.079
So this is an anonymous visit this time?

25:40.759 --> 25:42.200
How smart you are

25:43.119 --> 25:46.000
Madam Chu, you got it wrong

25:46.599 --> 25:49.279
I'm here to see Ms. Lin

25:51.039 --> 25:51.880
Mr. New

25:52.079 --> 25:54.359
It's your first time here.
You want to be our boss, ma'am?

25:59.160 --> 26:00.039
my dad?

26:05.024 --> 26:06.160
(16)

26:06.160 --> 26:07.040
my dad!

26:16.759 --> 26:17.720
this is me

26:18.079 --> 26:18.960
What's wrong?

26:19.599 --> 26:20.680
We check the evidence here

26:20.680 --> 26:22.000
Don't make a mess for us

26:22.240 --> 26:23.599
What do you mean by "causing chaos"?

26:23.599 --> 26:25.440
I'm here to give them clues too

26:25.440 --> 26:27.319
Can't you just tell me directly?

26:28.119 --> 26:29.640
Why should I tell you for free?

26:29.960 --> 26:32.200
They can get the money, why can't I?

26:32.559 --> 26:35.759
Also, my guide is real

26:37.279 --> 26:39.279
Dad, you're going to embarrass me

26:41.279 --> 26:42.640
Let's get this straight

26:42.759 --> 26:44.799
We are not alike

26:44.799 --> 26:47.440
They reward with money,
I take mine

26:47.880 --> 26:50.440
Whether you lose face or not
is your business

26:50.920 --> 26:54.319
I sacrifice personal feelings
for the greater good

26:54.599 --> 26:55.584
Xiong

26:55.720 --> 26:57.240
Let Mr. Gao in

26:57.359 --> 26:59.200
Look, it's finally his turn

26:59.200 --> 27:01.079
Yes, that's right baby

27:01.559 --> 27:03.319
He is sane

27:04.119 --> 27:05.119
rational?

27:06.880 --> 27:08.039
If you enter

27:08.359 --> 27:09.599
I'll go back and tell my mom

27:09.599 --> 27:11.160
That every time Mrs. Zhang
buys meat from you

27:11.160 --> 27:12.240
You give her extra meat

27:12.759 --> 27:13.600
Stand still!

27:15.039 --> 27:16.240
You little brawler

27:16.559 --> 27:17.440
Don't think you're too big

27:17.440 --> 27:18.599
To hit

27:18.599 --> 27:19.680
Let me show you

27:19.839 --> 27:20.440
Let's go

27:20.440 --> 27:21.344
the next

27:23.039 --> 27:24.559
- Money
- Are you going in or not?

27:24.559 --> 27:25.559
If not, step aside

27:25.640 --> 27:26.560
Yes

27:26.880 --> 27:27.720
I'll come in

27:28.000 --> 27:28.880
I'll go in now

27:29.240 --> 27:30.160
that's mine

27:32.240 --> 27:34.680
I just went out to check
and bumped into my parents

27:35.599 --> 27:37.839
He insisted on entering
and I couldn't stop him

27:38.160 --> 27:41.079
Mr. Gao, feel free to say it

27:41.400 --> 27:43.119
I was planning to tell him directly

27:47.519 --> 27:49.279
I am a tractor

27:49.839 --> 27:53.119
That's why I knew you were the
chef from the Lu family

27:53.759 --> 27:56.240
He often came to buy meat from me

27:57.240 --> 28:00.160
You were hard of a fool
when it came to the quality of meat

28:00.720 --> 28:01.920
Lu's family was wealthy

28:02.160 --> 28:05.279
So I always saved
the best meat for them

28:05.960 --> 28:08.599
After setting fire to Lu's house

28:08.920 --> 28:10.519
You are yo

28:10.759 --> 28:12.880
No one knows where he went

28:13.440 --> 28:14.336
he...

28:28.720 --> 28:31.319
Aren't you going to write down what I said?

28:36.640 --> 28:38.119
After 6 or 7 years

28:38.319 --> 28:40.400
Then
to Kilin Restaurant

28:40.880 --> 28:42.759
A man came to check on my meat

28:43.759 --> 28:46.440
The waiter there
they all called him the boss

28:46.960 --> 28:47.880
So I came to know

28:48.039 --> 28:51.480
The owner of the restaurant was
called Niu Bu Yan

28:53.359 --> 28:55.119
I didn't get home

28:55.359 --> 28:57.279
I realized that it was you

28:58.519 --> 29:01.119
It was originally full

29:01.279 --> 29:02.960
But he looked much thinner

29:04.200 --> 29:06.519
He must have recognized me too

29:06.759 --> 29:07.680
since then

29:08.000 --> 29:10.200
Killin Restaurant
Never order my meat again

29:11.599 --> 29:12.440
Thats all about it

29:13.960 --> 29:15.640
When did Killeen Restaurant open?

29:15.880 --> 29:16.839
It started a long time ago

29:17.680 --> 29:21.519
But a few years after the fire
at Lou's house, she changed her name

29:21.880 --> 29:22.920
Leon Restaurant

29:23.200 --> 29:24.064
Leon Restaurant

29:25.480 --> 29:26.432
my lord

29:27.119 --> 29:29.799
How much do you think
my words are worth?

29:30.599 --> 29:32.519
Dad, I just said a few words

29:32.519 --> 29:33.359
There is no evidence

29:33.359 --> 29:35.200
Forget the money and just go home

29:35.519 --> 29:36.839
What proof do you need?

29:36.839 --> 29:38.279
Do you think I'm lying?

29:39.279 --> 29:40.759
I am Gao Shizong's father

29:41.000 --> 29:42.160
I will not lie

29:42.559 --> 29:44.480
Mr. Gao, please calm down

29:44.480 --> 29:45.960
We definitely believe you

29:46.319 --> 29:47.400
But 500 taels can only be given to you

29:47.720 --> 29:49.119
to you after confirmation

29:49.400 --> 29:50.304
Good

29:51.680 --> 29:55.160
You came to me
for the plate, the moon, and the jade, right?

29:56.039 --> 29:56.896
Yes

29:57.400 --> 30:01.200
For gold and jade from the zodiac sign

30:02.079 --> 30:04.039
It's the season to eat crab

30:05.440 --> 30:08.559
Some customers always order
this dish in my restaurant

30:08.680 --> 30:10.240
So I tried it several times

30:10.240 --> 30:11.920
But customers see it

30:12.359 --> 30:14.400
He doesn't have good taste
like here

30:15.920 --> 30:18.839
That's why I came to ask for advice

30:24.519 --> 30:27.200
This crab bed is not very creative

30:28.680 --> 30:30.359
He has a hunting scent

30:33.200 --> 30:34.960
With this little fish

30:34.960 --> 30:38.519
I can sell it for one meat here

30:42.920 --> 30:44.279
Say

30:47.200 --> 30:51.319
Taste and price

30:53.039 --> 30:57.119
It varies from time to time

31:02.680 --> 31:03.880
as I expected

31:04.720 --> 31:05.696
Mr. New

31:06.640 --> 31:09.200
She didn't come for the dish

31:10.039 --> 31:10.960
Mrs. Lin

31:12.839 --> 31:14.440
If there was no melting fire

31:14.440 --> 31:17.200
20 years ago

31:19.839 --> 31:21.799
Where would we have it?

31:23.720 --> 31:25.559
Our wealth?

31:25.960 --> 31:28.640
What does the cause of the big fire
have to do with me?

31:30.640 --> 31:33.319
So if a customer doesn't
order from me

31:35.640 --> 31:37.759
I couldn't even get out
the door here

31:39.039 --> 31:40.839
But on the night of the fire

31:40.839 --> 31:42.799
Lu Jinchen, the second master
of the Lu family

31:43.039 --> 31:45.960
Come back drunk after dinner

31:46.480 --> 31:47.839
With you here

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
My job was to drink with the customers

31:51.440 --> 31:54.359
Captain Leng, Mr. Wang and Dr. Cheng

31:55.319 --> 31:58.880
What do the three of them have in common?

31:59.839 --> 32:02.599
It is that they partnered
with the Lu family

32:04.599 --> 32:09.079
That body was most likely Chen Wang
who had drowned himself in the river

32:10.200 --> 32:12.519
the next day

32:13.200 --> 32:17.400
I had a good relationship with him

32:19.519 --> 32:21.519
Just say what you want to say

32:30.400 --> 32:31.400
can we be

32:33.960 --> 32:36.480
The next one?

32:37.519 --> 32:39.079
It doesn't matter who's next

32:41.000 --> 32:43.880
It's not me who should, you
should come first

32:44.559 --> 32:46.680
Mr. Gao here is a series of coins

32:46.960 --> 32:47.872
Good

32:48.359 --> 32:49.359
If it is 500 taels

32:49.720 --> 32:50.960
I wouldn't dare accept

32:52.119 --> 32:54.039
These coins are not
a small amount indeed

32:54.480 --> 32:56.440
I hope my words are useful to you

32:56.640 --> 32:57.480
I'm leaving

33:05.200 --> 33:06.720
I'm sorry

33:07.039 --> 33:07.904
Mr. Gao

33:08.640 --> 33:09.559
I come

33:09.559 --> 33:11.880
Sangeng, you see he gave me the real money

33:14.079 --> 33:15.640
So you

33:15.640 --> 33:17.480
I have some valuable evidence

33:18.200 --> 33:20.480
Sangeng, go to my house
with Xisung tonight

33:20.480 --> 33:22.000
I'll invite you for a drink

33:22.319 --> 33:23.640
I will leave now

33:35.400 --> 33:36.319
Ko Sangg

33:38.240 --> 33:40.880
You have been receiving
different currencies

33:43.160 --> 33:46.880
So you must have got
some valuable stuff

33:48.200 --> 33:49.559
If I hadn't come to take a look

33:51.119 --> 33:52.640
It will be a big loss

34:00.000 --> 34:02.279
I am the judge of Yamin

34:02.599 --> 34:04.519
I'm here on official business today

34:04.920 --> 34:06.440
I'll listen from behind the screen

34:10.480 --> 34:12.079
Miss Lang, would you please?

34:12.880 --> 34:13.800
Step aside for a while?

34:14.440 --> 34:15.840
I am Captain Ling's daughter

34:16.440 --> 34:18.400
reward

34:18.679 --> 34:21.000
It wasn't Yamin, it was me

34:21.519 --> 34:23.400
Even this screen
was bought with my own money

34:23.800 --> 34:25.000
Why should I leave it aside?

34:35.440 --> 34:37.400
If you want to listen

34:38.000 --> 34:38.960
Please come

34:39.199 --> 34:40.039
And sit together

34:52.239 --> 34:54.239
I'm sorry I'm late

34:59.079 --> 35:00.032
Mr. Song

35:01.840 --> 35:02.688
Sit down, please

35:18.000 --> 35:20.199
Ling Rui, go away

35:32.480 --> 35:33.320
Are you back?

35:34.480 --> 35:35.920
I remembered something else

35:37.480 --> 35:38.400
What is it?

35:39.800 --> 35:42.079
Do you only want
these three people?

35:43.159 --> 35:44.039
What do you mean?

35:44.400 --> 35:45.360
I mean

35:45.559 --> 35:46.880
If there is someone else

35:46.880 --> 35:48.199
Who survived the fire

35:48.440 --> 35:49.880
Besides these three

35:49.880 --> 35:51.079
And I know where he is

35:51.679 --> 35:52.800
How much will you guys offer?

35:53.639 --> 35:54.679
Another person survived

35:55.639 --> 35:56.512
from?

35:56.599 --> 35:59.000
You have to tell me
how much you can offer first

36:00.360 --> 36:02.159
You must confirm
the person's existence first

36:02.679 --> 36:05.559
If you say so
I will be able to prove it for sure

36:05.559 --> 36:07.599
Then you must provide evidence

36:09.119 --> 36:11.880
Obtaining evidence
will require some effort

36:12.519 --> 36:14.559
You must first tell me
how much you will give me

36:26.519 --> 36:27.360
permission

36:27.679 --> 36:30.320
If you can really prove
that the person exists

36:30.800 --> 36:33.320
So, 1000 taels

36:35.719 --> 36:36.679
are you sure?

36:37.559 --> 36:39.639
But you can't fool
with some unrelated people

36:40.880 --> 36:42.400
Do they matter?

36:42.719 --> 36:44.519
You may end up getting scared

36:45.440 --> 36:46.336
I leave now

36:48.360 --> 36:49.280
When I come back in the day

36:51.639 --> 36:54.239
Habitat
had been burned to the ground

36:54.639 --> 36:58.639
The bodies were crushed beyond recognition

36:59.760 --> 37:01.320
We had to rely on body sizes

37:02.079 --> 37:03.920
And the location of burns

37:04.880 --> 37:06.400
To find out who they are

37:07.360 --> 37:11.039
The four members of Mr. Lu's family

37:12.840 --> 37:13.760
They all died

37:16.320 --> 37:19.559
The case was handled by Captain Ling

37:21.000 --> 37:23.400
Didn't he ever tell you anything?

37:25.639 --> 37:27.880
He wasn't as detailed as you

37:28.039 --> 37:30.079
I know this is impossible

37:32.239 --> 37:34.159
But somehow

37:35.519 --> 37:36.760
I suspect

37:37.360 --> 37:38.719
suspect

37:39.639 --> 37:41.159
It is because

37:42.400 --> 37:43.880
He wants to kill

37:44.639 --> 37:48.280
All relevant ones
at the moment

37:49.480 --> 37:52.400
So the owner is
Niu Boyan

37:53.679 --> 37:54.840
It's cooking, Ar

37:55.559 --> 37:56.512
correct

37:57.400 --> 37:58.760
Just based on my father's words?

37:59.079 --> 38:01.519
Not only your father
but also three other people

38:01.920 --> 38:03.679
Sellers of fish, vegetables and meat

38:04.199 --> 38:07.039
Previously, they told us
it looked familiar but they weren't sure

38:07.559 --> 38:10.280
Now they are sure when they know
there is money to be made

38:10.280 --> 38:12.000
Zhang Jizhu, the master of Mr. Xu's house

38:12.400 --> 38:13.840
They are said to be the guards of Lu's house

38:14.159 --> 38:15.136
Zhang Ji

38:16.159 --> 38:17.519
How many people said that?

38:17.880 --> 38:19.360
Just black mourning

38:23.079 --> 38:25.280
Liu Lao of Liujiajie
outside the western city gate

38:26.239 --> 38:27.679
He said he didn't remember
much about the man

38:28.119 --> 38:30.519
But the director came
to make a knife

38:30.800 --> 38:32.840
Specially designed knife
for the left hand

38:32.840 --> 38:33.792
This is the design

38:34.679 --> 38:37.079
The more he looked at it
the more familiar it seemed

38:38.280 --> 38:39.199
Guess what?

38:40.320 --> 38:41.280
Move everywhere

38:41.400 --> 38:43.000
And he found

38:43.159 --> 38:44.880
Same design from 20 years ago

38:46.239 --> 38:47.400
It turned out 20 years ago

38:47.400 --> 38:49.679
Zhang Ge asked his father
to make the same knife

38:50.400 --> 38:51.760
Both drawings are here

38:56.719 --> 38:57.760
As you see it

38:57.760 --> 38:58.880
What the blacksmith said

38:59.599 --> 39:00.480
trusted

39:03.559 --> 39:05.599
These two are identical

39:08.880 --> 39:12.000
This means that
Zhang Jie and You Er are alive

39:12.360 --> 39:14.239
Except Lu Che's whereabouts
are not known

39:16.320 --> 39:17.719
Lu Che's whereabouts could be deduced

39:19.840 --> 39:23.519
A large family cannot usually
choose without spending money in advance

39:23.880 --> 39:25.719
They usually go with someone
they know well

39:25.840 --> 39:27.559
And who served them for years

39:29.079 --> 39:32.440
If Zhang Jizhou
is Zhang Jie

39:33.440 --> 39:34.679
Mr. Shaw

39:36.800 --> 39:38.159
He Lu Che

39:40.880 --> 39:42.400
I don't care who wants to kill

39:44.880 --> 39:45.840
just me

39:48.519 --> 39:50.000
Leave it to fate

39:52.519 --> 39:54.400
You won't leave it to fate

39:56.360 --> 39:58.559
You're hoping to get lucky

40:00.840 --> 40:03.039
Do you know what's even scarier?

40:04.119 --> 40:06.559
The scariest thing
isn't that the suspect is outside

40:06.559 --> 40:07.559
He wants to kill you

40:08.400 --> 40:10.119
But you're hoping for luck

40:10.360 --> 40:12.719
And I'm thinking the killer
might leave you alone

40:12.840 --> 40:14.079
but me

40:15.800 --> 40:17.119
I never could

40:18.079 --> 40:21.320
I hope you get lucky

40:25.519 --> 40:27.320
I'm not hoping for luck

40:29.400 --> 40:31.920
Only those who are afraid
of death will have luck

40:33.679 --> 40:34.599
I am not afraid

40:37.840 --> 40:38.784
Is death?

40:41.880 --> 40:43.239
Is this really terrifying?

40:57.119 --> 40:58.016
Mr. New

41:03.392 --> 41:04.320
Mr. Zhang

41:04.320 --> 41:05.559
what are you doing here?

41:07.880 --> 41:09.760
I'm just taking a chance

41:10.679 --> 41:11.840
For happiness

41:14.119 --> 41:15.880
We don't have to be like this, right?

41:16.400 --> 41:17.880
thank God

41:19.280 --> 41:21.559
If this person has not forgotten me yet

41:23.079 --> 41:24.599
My cheap life

41:25.400 --> 41:27.199
My life might just be saved

41:30.199 --> 41:32.256
Don't talk and don't come with me

41:51.776 --> 41:55.616
(FortuneTeller Yue of the Kuozing Sect)

41:56.960 --> 42:00.864
(Machine)

42:14.639 --> 42:17.119
Don't you really recognize me?

42:26.639 --> 42:27.880
Owner of Killeen Restaurant

42:29.360 --> 42:30.639
He was brought to Mr. Xie's house

42:31.760 --> 42:33.400
By that bright Zhang?

42:33.760 --> 42:34.624
Yes

42:35.119 --> 42:36.000
Until midnight

42:42.400 --> 42:44.199
Liwei San, from tomorrow onwards

42:44.199 --> 42:45.920
Keep an eye on Niu Boyan, the owner

42:46.639 --> 42:48.320
The owner of Qilin Restaurant
instead of Zhang Jizhou

42:52.480 --> 42:53.639
Somebody!

42:55.159 --> 42:56.079
He's the leader

42:56.079 --> 42:57.239
Somebody!

42:59.960 --> 43:02.199
person! Help!

43:02.199 --> 43:03.072
my lord

43:03.360 --> 43:04.288
Help yourself

43:13.280 --> 43:14.208
Sangang

43:18.039 --> 43:19.039
thank God

43:19.480 --> 43:21.719
Which one of you is Niu Boyan,
the owner of Qilin Restaurant?

43:22.519 --> 43:23.360
This is me

43:23.880 --> 43:25.400
Led by the district judge

43:25.719 --> 43:28.000
We are here to take you
to Yamin for interrogation

43:28.519 --> 43:29.360
Niu Bu Yan

43:29.800 --> 43:30.752
our

43:32.519 --> 43:35.199
According to what you said,
I went to the governorate to buy goods

43:35.320 --> 43:37.840
As a restaurateur
why did you do this to yourself?

43:38.400 --> 43:39.328
our

43:40.039 --> 43:42.480
I was going to buy
a load of dry goods this time

43:43.440 --> 43:45.480
It's valuable

43:45.480 --> 43:47.760
It costs a lot of money

43:48.360 --> 43:51.320
I really didn't trust

43:51.800 --> 43:53.519
My subordinates are clumsy

43:56.000 --> 43:57.719
Isn't it just some food?

43:58.360 --> 44:00.519
They are not ordinary ingredients

44:00.800 --> 44:03.000
It's very rare

44:03.519 --> 44:05.719
Such large croquettes as a tea plate

44:05.960 --> 44:07.320
The shark's big toes are like a door curtain

44:08.000 --> 44:09.400
The sea cucumbers are as big as berries

44:09.400 --> 44:11.039
PAWS holds a larger hand fan

44:11.039 --> 44:12.599
And tricks like sewing

44:12.960 --> 44:16.239
It was my first time seeing them

44:18.719 --> 44:20.199
Before Niu Boyan left the province

44:20.840 --> 44:22.480
He toured completely with a carriage

44:23.079 --> 44:24.360
He visited him everywhere

44:25.159 --> 44:26.080
Looks like

44:26.920 --> 44:28.679
He was trying to show it clearly

45:11.360 --> 45:12.288
he is here

45:18.599 --> 45:19.456
Run

45:23.119 --> 45:25.440
Who was it that cut off the horse's leg?

45:26.400 --> 45:27.760
I don't know

45:28.159 --> 45:31.159
I think it must be the bandits
who stole the goods

45:31.239 --> 45:33.079
Did you recognize his face clearly?

45:33.400 --> 45:34.280
permission

45:36.039 --> 45:37.800
He was wearing a public kiss

45:38.079 --> 45:39.639
His face was full of thick beard

45:40.119 --> 45:43.639
Which appears
difficult to distinguish

45:44.760 --> 45:47.000
This is in line with the statement
from that horse

45:47.280 --> 45:48.639
This is the killer

45:50.679 --> 45:53.119
I thought about which of the three survivors
was the killer

45:54.119 --> 45:57.199
Incredibly, Niu Bu Yan
was also a target

46:03.599 --> 46:04.679
for this reason

46:05.880 --> 46:07.039
Follow the killer Niu Bo Yan

46:09.039 --> 46:10.679
After leaving the province

46:16.079 --> 46:18.199
I think that was Niu Boyan's original plan

46:19.159 --> 46:21.119
You were pretending to leave Do County

46:22.000 --> 46:24.119
Obviously the killer
didn't let him leave

46:25.039 --> 46:27.239
Niu Bu Yan planned to use himself as bait

46:27.760 --> 46:29.000
To lure the killer

46:39.199 --> 46:40.800
He ran in that direction

46:42.559 --> 46:44.239
Who are the other two on the cart?

46:46.119 --> 46:49.239
They are the presenter and the chief guard
of Mr. Shih's family

46:50.320 --> 46:53.159
Why was the director
and chief guard of Mr. Xie's house

46:53.159 --> 46:55.119
with you?

46:56.559 --> 46:57.440
our

46:58.000 --> 46:59.800
The shipment is very valuable

47:00.119 --> 47:02.039
I can't handle it alone

47:02.360 --> 47:05.400
So I partnered with Mr. Xie for that

47:06.159 --> 47:08.840
Presenter, Mr. Zhang
and Chairman, Mr. Liu

47:09.000 --> 47:10.360
minute

47:10.519 --> 47:11.840
They have martial arts skills

47:12.320 --> 47:14.000
They can ensure
safety along the journey

47:14.840 --> 47:15.920
Once the killer was lured

47:15.920 --> 47:18.239
Mr. Zhang and Mr. Liu are testing
in the cart

47:18.239 --> 47:20.239
He could take the opportunity
to kill the killer

47:22.239 --> 47:23.104
It seems that

47:24.079 --> 47:25.880
The prey will fight back

47:27.760 --> 47:30.320
Even knowing it was a trap

47:30.480 --> 47:32.679
The killer couldn't just
escape Niu Boyan

47:32.840 --> 47:34.599
He had no choice but to follow her

47:35.199 --> 47:37.039
What a smart plan

47:38.280 --> 47:39.232
But unlucky

47:39.760 --> 47:41.679
The killer had seen through the scheme

47:42.199 --> 47:44.119
He even planned his
escape route in advance

47:53.639 --> 47:54.719
That farangi

47:54.719 --> 47:56.039
(General term for Western firearms)

47:56.039 --> 47:57.199
It has no valve

47:58.320 --> 48:00.159
Really something I haven't seen

48:02.119 --> 48:03.119
Without a match

48:04.880 --> 48:06.559
Franji without a slow match

48:14.920 --> 48:16.639
I've heard about this before

48:21.480 --> 48:24.039
Even for foreigners
it is extremely rare

48:28.519 --> 48:30.480
It was said that Wang Wufeng
had two in the past

48:32.360 --> 48:33.880
The price must be very high

48:37.320 --> 48:39.320
Mr. Zhang and Mr. Liu

48:40.480 --> 48:41.440
Skilled in martial arts

48:41.920 --> 48:43.199
Who are you two?

48:43.760 --> 48:45.519
Why do you carry weapons with you?

48:45.960 --> 48:47.199
You claim to be an officer

48:48.079 --> 48:49.280
But what is your evidence?

48:49.719 --> 48:51.599
You know I'm telling the truth

48:52.000 --> 48:53.199
After coming with me to the days

48:53.320 --> 48:54.240
Yamin?

48:56.199 --> 48:57.056
Good

48:58.559 --> 49:00.199
to stop!

49:00.559 --> 49:02.320
Don't quarrel

49:02.320 --> 49:04.960
friendly

49:07.079 --> 49:09.679
It's a misunderstanding

49:13.400 --> 49:14.559
New Boyan

49:15.000 --> 49:17.159
He attacked me even
before I knew who I was

49:17.559 --> 49:19.679
According to his logic
it didn't matter who I was

49:20.239 --> 49:21.239
He was just going to kill me first

49:23.719 --> 49:25.639
He is decisive and ruthless

49:27.199 --> 49:28.320
He must have killed people

49:30.480 --> 49:31.440
New Boyan

49:31.440 --> 49:34.239
We received an anonymous message
early in the morning

49:34.719 --> 49:36.840
The message says

49:37.360 --> 49:39.119
You are the one who killed Captain Leng

49:39.119 --> 49:41.800
Mr. Wang and Dr. Cheng

49:42.639 --> 49:43.488
I am innocent

49:43.719 --> 49:44.559
our

49:44.559 --> 49:46.119
This is a false accusation

49:47.519 --> 49:49.679
We did not believe it easily

49:50.280 --> 49:53.119
All the matter was that the message said
you would run away for fear of punishment

49:53.360 --> 49:56.239
So I immediately sent people
to your house

49:56.400 --> 49:58.920
They said you left early
in the morning by carriage

49:59.119 --> 50:01.199
Which made me
believe the message a little

50:01.719 --> 50:04.119
So I sent at the same time
four groups of couriers

50:04.119 --> 50:05.920
From the four city gates to your pursuer

50:06.480 --> 50:10.480
Ours, the message
forms an absolute framework

50:10.679 --> 50:11.616
that it...

50:12.199 --> 50:14.599
She must be jealous
of the other restaurant owners

50:15.519 --> 50:17.360
Not that simple, is it?

50:18.400 --> 50:21.519
Jealousy will not necessarily lead
to such a thing

50:22.519 --> 50:25.199
While the message really came through

50:25.960 --> 50:27.239
Even I was surprised

50:28.199 --> 50:31.639
Infiltration with malicious intent
is already worth 100 hits

50:33.039 --> 50:33.952
our

50:34.280 --> 50:36.159
The message cannot be trusted

50:36.960 --> 50:38.239
My restaurant

50:38.480 --> 50:40.159
Not a big job

50:40.280 --> 50:43.519
But it is one of the most important
in Dou Province

50:44.239 --> 50:45.840
I have a family and my own business

50:45.840 --> 50:47.599
Why would I kill someone?

50:48.119 --> 50:49.840
Regardless of the validity of the statement
of the statement

50:50.239 --> 50:52.320
I can't ignore it
as if I've never seen it before

50:54.800 --> 50:55.712
What about this?

50:57.840 --> 51:00.280
Pay bail and then you can go home

51:01.079 --> 51:02.360
Continue with your routine

51:03.920 --> 51:05.760
But you are prohibited
from leaving the district

51:06.480 --> 51:07.392
Yes

51:08.159 --> 51:11.119
It was smart for the killer
to get the idea of ​​exploiting us

51:12.039 --> 51:14.840
The letter to Yamin
must be from the killer

51:15.800 --> 51:18.519
He wanted to buy time
by paralyzing the horse first

51:19.679 --> 51:22.800
Then use the letter
to imprison Niu Buyan in Du Province

51:24.840 --> 51:26.480
Doing two things at the same time

51:27.400 --> 51:28.679
Can he do it in time?

51:29.440 --> 51:31.079
He can call inside Yamin

51:31.440 --> 51:32.288
What?

51:38.199 --> 51:39.519
(in daylight,)

51:40.599 --> 51:42.400
(Knife stuck)
(Yamin)

51:42.920 --> 51:43.808
our

51:44.079 --> 51:45.056
It's a message

51:45.800 --> 51:46.656
message?

51:47.079 --> 51:48.360
(It must have been done by the assistant)

51:55.719 --> 51:56.736
New Boyan!

51:56.920 --> 51:57.824
our

51:58.159 --> 52:00.159
There is still one thing I would like to ask

52:00.159 --> 52:01.519
You must answer honestly

52:01.920 --> 52:03.920
I won't hide anything

52:08.039 --> 52:10.960
Are there really dried
tea powders the size of tea

52:10.960 --> 52:12.760
Are fish fingers the size of the curtains?

52:20.360 --> 52:22.559
Yes, there really is

52:23.920 --> 52:24.880
Once the goods arrive

52:25.320 --> 52:28.800
I will prepare some dishes

52:29.159 --> 52:32.864
to taste

52:40.159 --> 52:42.079
Mr. Song, do you have any questions?

52:42.079 --> 52:43.079
Your questions are comprehensive

52:46.480 --> 52:47.800
Originally assumed

52:48.519 --> 52:50.679
The size and species of the shark

52:51.599 --> 52:53.599
It was the most suspicious

52:56.039 --> 52:56.960
You Er

52:58.440 --> 52:59.800
You can stay with me now

53:01.559 --> 53:03.440
I have more than 100 guards in my palace

53:04.480 --> 53:05.960
Who can protect you

53:08.079 --> 53:09.639
That would be too much

53:10.480 --> 53:13.719
Having a few of them
guarding me closely is enough

53:14.840 --> 53:16.000
The target of the killer

53:16.599 --> 53:18.159
Not just to kill us

53:18.480 --> 53:21.639
He also wants to put us
as he sees fit

53:22.239 --> 53:24.760
If there are others around
it will be stopped

53:25.239 --> 53:26.599
But after this time

53:26.960 --> 53:29.440
The killer will be more careful

53:29.679 --> 53:31.159
I wonder

53:31.760 --> 53:33.440
Why is that plainclothes officer?

53:33.719 --> 53:35.960
He followed me out of the county

53:38.199 --> 53:41.079
Seems like the reward they put out

53:42.239 --> 53:43.320
Really works

53:48.199 --> 53:49.360
Officers in Yamin

53:51.800 --> 53:55.039
Maybe they know our true identities now

53:56.840 --> 53:58.239
Even if they knew

53:59.440 --> 54:00.519
What can they do?

54:00.719 --> 54:02.400
They can't do anything now

54:03.000 --> 54:05.920
But then that incident 20 years ago

54:07.320 --> 54:08.880
We left Do County

54:09.360 --> 54:13.119
She returned under another name
three years later

54:14.920 --> 54:16.519
Why was that?

54:18.079 --> 54:20.239
There are many secrets
behind that incident

54:21.599 --> 54:22.496
Secrets

54:23.480 --> 54:25.199
Can't bear to discuss

54:25.599 --> 54:27.599
But it's all a secret

54:28.440 --> 54:29.639
He has his use

54:33.079 --> 54:33.952
you r

54:35.239 --> 54:37.360
I have visited Lin Sinyang before

54:39.719 --> 54:40.920
what did she say?

54:41.760 --> 54:43.239
Captain Ling told me

54:44.480 --> 54:46.000
You didn't tell her anything

54:48.639 --> 54:49.599
But

54:49.599 --> 54:52.559
but you are

54:58.760 --> 55:00.480
I hope you have no luck

55:05.760 --> 55:08.960
In the park where I saw you

55:09.216 --> 55:10.079
Hisung

55:10.079 --> 55:10.976
What are you looking at?

55:11.159 --> 55:13.480
This thing, like bleachers

55:13.840 --> 55:16.079
It was published everywhere overnight

55:16.079 --> 55:18.199
Is this a poem?

55:18.760 --> 55:19.680
What does it mean?

55:19.880 --> 55:20.920
I don't understand either

55:21.159 --> 55:23.079
But I know who posted that

55:23.400 --> 55:24.320
from?

55:25.000 --> 55:26.360
Spread her luck

55:27.039 --> 55:28.920
In the park where I saw you

55:29.519 --> 55:31.280
Nine crickets can be heard

55:32.159 --> 55:34.159
20 years have passed and appearances have changed

55:34.679 --> 55:36.800
I'm more shy and disoriented

55:37.400 --> 55:39.239
At night, I realized how kind young people were

55:40.039 --> 55:42.000
In the same place
rape is still swelling at a young age

55:42.480 --> 55:44.440
Taoist gave me the flower of revival

55:44.920 --> 55:46.880
When I see you,
the grass renews

55:47.519 --> 55:48.599
General Tongtu

55:49.119 --> 55:51.079
On the 30th day
of the tenth month, one year for Jake

55:53.639 --> 55:55.239
It's broadband

55:55.840 --> 55:57.079
involved in?

55:57.840 --> 56:00.960
Read the first characters
of each line together

56:01.840 --> 56:04.000
See you around nine
at night at the same place

56:04.800 --> 56:06.840
This is not just an auditory description

56:07.480 --> 56:09.079
It's full of code words

56:10.159 --> 56:12.400
And "General Tongtu"

56:12.400 --> 56:14.559
It must be him and his friend

56:14.559 --> 56:15.840
What he went through in the past

56:16.599 --> 56:18.519
He tells his friend

56:19.480 --> 56:20.599
"I know you"

56:21.079 --> 56:23.400
" Revival Flower"
and "Renewed Grass"

56:25.320 --> 56:27.000
It's a hint

56:27.199 --> 56:29.159
That others think his friend is dead

56:29.159 --> 56:31.360
But he knows that the friend is still alive

56:32.679 --> 56:33.559
history

56:33.559 --> 56:35.159
It has a basic meaning

56:35.159 --> 56:37.039
It is the 30th day of the tenth month

56:37.679 --> 56:39.400
But today is day 25

56:39.400 --> 56:42.039
So this is it

56:42.199 --> 56:43.800
Not the date it was written

56:43.800 --> 56:45.320
It is a date of their meeting

56:46.239 --> 56:47.559
On the 30th day of the tenth month

56:48.039 --> 56:50.400
See you around nine
at night at the same place

56:52.199 --> 56:54.480
But who could this person be?

56:54.840 --> 56:56.519
His long time friend could have died

56:56.519 --> 56:58.639
But the fortuneteller
is very careful about money

56:58.639 --> 57:00.760
So he thinks he saw his old friend

57:01.039 --> 57:02.840
Let's go check it out
when the time comes

57:03.480 --> 57:04.352
Good

57:04.679 --> 57:06.920
I don't know where they will meet

57:07.320 --> 57:09.599
But I know the average place
puts its weight in a stall stall

57:10.119 --> 57:11.239
Watch him

57:29.960 --> 57:30.880
Shichong

57:32.480 --> 57:33.559
What time is it now?

57:35.079 --> 57:36.000
About eleven o'clock in the evening

57:36.880 --> 57:39.079
His friend may not come tonight

57:39.559 --> 57:41.960
It's unlikely...
the person even exists

57:42.280 --> 57:43.232
Who won't come?

57:44.440 --> 57:46.144
That's me, that's okay

57:47.199 --> 57:49.960
San, you scared me

57:51.440 --> 57:53.568
Look what I brought you,
roasted sweet potatoes

57:54.239 --> 57:55.159
Still exciting

57:55.159 --> 57:56.000
Thank you, Liuyi-san

57:56.000 --> 57:56.840
Hurry up and eat

57:56.840 --> 57:57.880
Sangeng, there you are

58:02.039 --> 58:05.000
Eat and then you can come back

58:05.239 --> 58:07.599
I'll keep an eye on him here, don't worry

58:10.159 --> 58:11.480
I suddenly thought of something

58:12.719 --> 58:14.840
These bodies were all discovered
early in the morning

58:15.559 --> 58:17.960
So the killer took action
in the small hours

58:19.639 --> 58:20.480
so what?

58:26.480 --> 58:27.440
the criminal

58:29.280 --> 58:30.679
Not really afraid of the cold

58:46.407 --> 58:49.990
(In his youth, his vital force is unstable)
He must beware of lust

58:54.288 --> 58:56.395
