00:36.540 --> 00:40.481
(September 7, 1589 AD)

00:43.640 --> 00:45.439
Mr. Lu has come forward several times

00:45.920 --> 00:47.159
Is the dregs ready?

00:47.399 --> 00:48.359
yes it is

00:48.439 --> 00:49.439
Mr. Lu

00:50.079 --> 00:51.000
I'll take you to your room

00:51.439 --> 00:53.719
Mom, my dad got drunk again

00:55.359 --> 00:56.240
ping

00:56.240 --> 00:57.479
Ignore your father

00:58.119 --> 00:59.640
Let's go and eat okay?

01:00.000 --> 01:00.880
ping

01:06.280 --> 01:06.959
but you are

01:07.319 --> 01:08.280
It's getting dark

01:08.280 --> 01:09.439
Don't read books outside anymore

01:10.120 --> 01:10.920
Yes, mom

01:14.760 --> 01:15.439
Xiao Bao

01:20.519 --> 01:21.599
Found an interesting place

01:22.560 --> 01:24.239
in our home

01:24.799 --> 01:26.040
Any interesting place?

01:29.840 --> 01:31.359
Today, I couldn't find Lu Che

01:32.040 --> 01:32.920
I believed

01:33.519 --> 01:35.439
Maybe he went fishing
with Mr. Zhong again

01:37.040 --> 01:38.640
So, I went to Mr. Zhong's courtyard

01:39.079 --> 01:40.879
Mr. Chung was not there

01:41.519 --> 01:42.480
The patio door was stuck

01:44.159 --> 01:45.280
After that, out of boredom

01:45.480 --> 01:46.920
The tree was planted
in the adjacent yard

01:47.120 --> 01:48.079
And I entered his yard

01:48.519 --> 01:49.959
Why did you get into his art?

01:52.799 --> 01:54.959
I always find this curiosity very strange

01:55.680 --> 01:57.000
maybe

01:57.280 --> 01:58.480
Because he ran out

01:58.840 --> 02:01.040
I found a secret in the yard

02:02.200 --> 02:02.920
Head?

02:05.040 --> 02:05.920
What secret?

02:10.000 --> 02:11.280
Found it in the yard

02:11.879 --> 02:12.840
There is a well

02:14.199 --> 02:15.560
a well?

02:16.280 --> 02:17.560
this is very strange

02:18.319 --> 02:20.479
Why is there a well?

02:20.680 --> 02:22.159
It's a dry well

02:22.639 --> 02:23.919
What?

02:24.439 --> 02:25.719
This is even strange

02:26.319 --> 02:27.400
How can there be dry wells?

02:27.639 --> 02:29.479
in this world?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.960
If you act like this,
I won't tell you anymore

02:34.439 --> 02:35.240
I see

02:35.520 --> 02:36.240
Go

02:38.280 --> 02:39.759
There is a rope in the well

02:40.159 --> 02:41.680
I followed him down

02:42.879 --> 02:43.680
Certainly enough

02:45.680 --> 02:46.560
Found a secret room

02:49.000 --> 02:50.439
At the bottom of the well

02:51.080 --> 02:51.639
Secret room?

02:52.439 --> 02:53.319
What's inside?

02:55.280 --> 02:56.159
nothing

02:56.680 --> 02:57.759
Let's go

02:59.039 --> 03:01.120
It was black inside
and I couldn't see anything

03:01.719 --> 03:02.759
I didn't bring a torch

03:03.080 --> 03:03.759
but

03:04.159 --> 03:06.639
The secret room is impressive enough

03:08.680 --> 03:09.840
I hear

03:10.159 --> 03:11.840
Rich families have this kind of place

03:12.080 --> 03:13.199
Used to obliterate money

03:13.879 --> 03:14.879
I heard about that too

03:15.960 --> 03:18.879
So how exactly did you leave the yard?

03:20.719 --> 03:23.080
There are trees in the courtyard of the supervising side

03:24.039 --> 03:24.719
Xiaobao

03:24.919 --> 03:27.360
Why don't you stay here today?

03:27.960 --> 03:29.080
When Mr. Zhong is sleeping tonight

03:29.080 --> 03:29.800
We can go

03:30.159 --> 03:32.520
Explore together with Lu Che

03:36.520 --> 03:37.319
Is it delicious?

03:37.719 --> 03:38.719
How is your cooking skill?

03:39.639 --> 03:40.360
Tasty

03:42.000 --> 03:43.159
But it's salty

03:44.759 --> 03:45.960
This is not usually the case

03:45.960 --> 03:46.840
It's salty today

03:47.599 --> 03:48.919
I originally wanted to bring you soup

03:48.919 --> 03:50.199
But I got my hands full

03:50.840 --> 03:52.039
I'll get you some water

03:52.039 --> 03:52.599
No thank you

03:53.000 --> 03:53.879
I will do it myself

04:01.759 --> 04:02.680
there is no place

04:05.120 --> 04:06.159
Lu Che

04:08.080 --> 04:09.240
Did you serve your teacher well?

04:12.360 --> 04:13.080
Mr. Lu

04:20.079 --> 04:20.920
Very sleepy?

04:22.519 --> 04:23.560
Are you tired of climbing?

04:35.639 --> 04:36.920
It's very salty

04:38.079 --> 04:40.000
How much salt is used in cooking?

04:43.720 --> 04:44.639
I'll find some water

04:53.040 --> 04:54.680
The water stone is empty

05:04.879 --> 05:06.240
Each one must be killed with a single stab

05:06.240 --> 05:07.519
Don't make noise

05:08.439 --> 05:10.079
Why take unnecessary actions?

05:11.199 --> 05:13.240
We'll start the fire anyway

05:13.800 --> 05:16.360
What if I wake them up now?

05:16.600 --> 05:18.199
What if they wake up
when the fire is lit?

05:18.199 --> 05:19.360
Will you be responsible then?

05:20.040 --> 05:20.680
I...

05:21.000 --> 05:23.920
Where did Mr. Lu learn this method?

05:24.480 --> 05:26.240
Tonight, we'll all have blood
on our hands

05:26.240 --> 05:28.120
We'll be in the same boat

05:30.160 --> 05:31.079
I will kill Luo Jinchen

05:32.639 --> 05:34.800
Liu Shiqi will kill his wife
and daughter

05:35.480 --> 05:36.199
Chen Wang

05:36.360 --> 05:37.319
I will kill you if you are with me

05:38.000 --> 05:38.600
Let's go

06:49.959 --> 06:50.759
Mr. Lu

06:50.959 --> 06:52.600
Why is your house so quiet?

06:54.959 --> 06:57.959
Kuihua Tower is noisy at this time

07:00.720 --> 07:02.480
A good family is quiet?

07:35.079 --> 07:35.680
Smoke

07:36.680 --> 07:37.600
Where is the smoke?

07:41.600 --> 07:42.279
He's on fire

07:42.360 --> 07:43.240
Mr. Lu

07:44.040 --> 07:44.800
Mr. Lu

07:45.480 --> 07:46.279
Mr. Lu

07:46.480 --> 07:47.240
Mr. Lu

07:49.800 --> 07:50.519
Mr. Lu

07:51.079 --> 07:52.480
He's on fire

07:52.480 --> 07:53.079
Xiao Bao

07:53.079 --> 07:53.759
Get out of here

08:32.759 --> 08:33.399
horse

08:34.519 --> 08:35.720
There's a side door to the stables

08:36.039 --> 08:36.840
Go that way

08:41.639 --> 08:43.000
Who grabbed the straws here?

08:43.120 --> 08:43.960
Mr. Lu

08:44.360 --> 08:45.440
Where should we go?

08:46.600 --> 08:47.320
To Bir Al-Jaf

08:48.480 --> 08:49.720
Mr. Chung's yard is nearby

08:50.000 --> 08:50.919
Let's hide there

08:50.919 --> 08:51.759
where?

08:52.399 --> 08:53.000
there

08:53.559 --> 08:54.159
Go

09:02.519 --> 09:03.240
Mr. Lu

09:03.679 --> 09:04.639
How deep is this well?

09:05.000 --> 09:05.759
It is very deep

09:06.120 --> 09:07.240
When I came during the day

09:07.759 --> 09:08.840
There was a rope here

09:10.039 --> 09:10.879
Where is the rope?

09:15.840 --> 09:16.679
pregnancy

09:20.320 --> 09:20.919
ping

09:22.200 --> 09:22.840
ping

09:24.720 --> 09:26.360
my dad and mom

09:26.799 --> 09:27.480
ping

09:28.039 --> 09:28.759
ping

09:29.360 --> 09:30.039
Mr. Lu

09:30.679 --> 09:31.240
no

09:31.240 --> 09:32.159
I have to find ping

09:32.159 --> 09:33.440
I must find her

09:33.480 --> 09:34.240
Mr. Lu

09:34.240 --> 09:34.840
ping

09:34.840 --> 09:35.759
Let's avoid the fire first

09:36.039 --> 09:37.279
They must all be sold out

09:37.639 --> 09:38.559
Its people?

09:38.559 --> 09:39.559
Yes

09:41.799 --> 09:42.399
permission

09:43.519 --> 09:44.639
All sold out

09:44.639 --> 09:45.440
Let's jump

09:45.440 --> 09:46.200
We ran out

09:47.240 --> 09:47.879
jumps?

09:49.720 --> 09:50.320
no

09:51.200 --> 09:52.039
Without the cord

09:52.440 --> 09:53.720
We can't get out first

09:53.840 --> 09:54.960
I might find it in stability

09:54.960 --> 09:55.759
You are waiting here

09:55.759 --> 09:56.519
I will look for it

10:00.519 --> 10:01.399
Put this

10:01.799 --> 10:02.960
Breathe less smoke

10:17.159 --> 10:18.679
I didn't start a fire in the back garden

10:18.679 --> 10:20.039
We can leave there later

10:23.039 --> 10:24.440
I have nothing to take

10:25.559 --> 10:26.679
What are we doing here?

10:31.240 --> 10:32.399
I have something I need to take

10:34.320 --> 10:35.240
What is it?

10:36.039 --> 10:36.879
there

10:42.039 --> 10:43.279
I want to come back

10:49.080 --> 10:49.879
Why?

10:51.120 --> 10:52.279
Why?

10:58.519 --> 10:59.879
Understood

11:00.440 --> 11:01.600
I discovered...

11:02.960 --> 11:04.840
I discovered my gold

11:07.519 --> 11:09.919
You want gold

11:11.039 --> 11:14.720
The gold that Lu Yuanbao gave me

11:14.879 --> 11:16.279
What?

11:17.639 --> 11:18.679
You lost your mind

11:20.080 --> 11:21.480
I have gold

11:22.159 --> 11:22.960
Good

11:24.279 --> 11:25.000
Okay

11:27.679 --> 11:29.840
Lu Yuanbao didn't tell you
to kill me, right?

11:30.679 --> 11:31.440
Yes, he did that

11:31.440 --> 11:33.120
You're fantasizing about me, aren't you?

11:33.799 --> 11:34.919
no

11:35.960 --> 11:38.639
You wanted me
to be your son, didn't you?

11:46.200 --> 11:48.320
Yes

11:49.320 --> 11:50.399
you are crazy

11:51.360 --> 11:54.200
I don't need a father

12:03.480 --> 12:05.480
I won't let you control me anymore

13:18.720 --> 13:19.840
Why is this happening?

13:20.919 --> 13:22.080
Why?

13:23.440 --> 13:24.840
Xiao Bo

13:26.480 --> 13:27.879
Xiao Bo

13:36.679 --> 13:38.120
He's on fire

13:39.039 --> 13:40.399
What are you standing there for?

13:40.399 --> 13:41.639
Go get someone to put out the fire!

13:41.639 --> 13:42.200
Go

13:42.720 --> 13:43.639
shoot!

13:46.000 --> 13:46.960
I'll go get it

13:49.080 --> 13:50.120
Captain Lang

13:50.360 --> 13:51.559
Look at them

13:51.559 --> 13:52.080
that they...

14:01.240 --> 14:02.399
What are you doing here?

14:05.279 --> 14:06.639
You can hide

14:06.639 --> 14:07.960
Or pretend to start a fire

14:08.080 --> 14:09.480
How do you watch that?

14:12.559 --> 14:13.159
Yes

14:14.600 --> 14:15.960
That was my lack of destiny

14:16.120 --> 14:17.200
Your inability?

14:17.720 --> 14:20.000
Another life was lost
because of your lack of concern

14:20.759 --> 14:22.639
That night watchman is a good guy

14:22.639 --> 14:23.960
He is a good person

14:24.600 --> 14:26.960
Many good people died today

14:29.240 --> 14:31.039
The number of bodies
is in line with the number of people

14:31.279 --> 14:32.279
Is there anyone else?

14:32.279 --> 14:34.159
Who is as tall as you?

14:34.480 --> 14:36.840
Even with you?

14:37.279 --> 14:38.000
What happened?

14:38.000 --> 14:40.120
I did not find Le Bot's body
in his room

14:40.759 --> 14:42.200
But I found one somewhere else

14:43.919 --> 14:45.120
Chen Wang...

14:45.879 --> 14:47.480
Can you show me the body?

14:47.480 --> 14:48.960
What interest?

14:48.960 --> 14:50.519
It's burned out now

14:50.799 --> 14:53.200
However, I have to see it

14:53.799 --> 14:55.600
He must die

15:52.983 --> 15:57.031
= Rippy Town =
= Episode 12 =

16:00.229 --> 16:03.747
(Three days after the fire in 1589 AH)

16:05.000 --> 16:05.720
Lu Che

16:05.840 --> 16:07.519
I just went through
a big incident like this

16:07.519 --> 16:08.679
what are you doing here?

16:08.679 --> 16:09.720
Mr. Chow

16:10.879 --> 16:11.799
before

16:12.360 --> 16:14.519
Mr. Lu gave me a receipt

16:14.519 --> 16:15.759
He asked me to show it to you

16:16.519 --> 16:18.039
But before this

16:18.840 --> 16:20.519
The accident happened

16:21.440 --> 16:22.879
Which Mr. Lu?

16:24.039 --> 16:25.320
You'll know as soon as you see it

16:27.799 --> 16:28.720
Answer him

16:29.159 --> 16:30.519
Mr. Lu ordered me

16:31.679 --> 16:33.279
It just allows you to see that

16:36.480 --> 16:37.399
Leave us alone

16:47.519 --> 16:48.240
Please

16:59.399 --> 17:00.639
What do you mean by this?

17:02.799 --> 17:04.079
please forgive me

17:04.680 --> 17:06.440
These are instructions from Mr. Lu

17:07.160 --> 17:08.599
You have to read it that way

17:09.839 --> 17:12.160
This is Lu Yuanbao's handwriting

17:12.839 --> 17:14.359
Indeed, he wrote it

17:15.720 --> 17:18.319
Lu Che is sincere

17:18.640 --> 17:20.039
and Makres

17:20.559 --> 17:23.000
I feel sorry
for losing his parents so early

17:23.359 --> 17:24.440
He's a worker

17:25.240 --> 17:26.279
But he is really like my son

17:26.920 --> 17:31.079
Therefore, I will give him my shares
in Hongchun Textile Restaurant

17:34.640 --> 17:36.880
To reward his loyalty

17:38.119 --> 17:39.079
Mr. Chow

17:40.759 --> 17:43.480
I am just a humble servant

17:44.079 --> 17:45.279
I didn't dare cross it

17:46.200 --> 17:48.839
But since Mr. Lu had this will

17:49.119 --> 17:50.720
I don't dare contradict that

17:50.720 --> 17:52.319
Amol

17:53.519 --> 17:55.920
We can cooperate well in the future

18:02.880 --> 18:04.480
how dare you

18:06.079 --> 18:09.240
I made a will
to seize the inheritance

18:11.119 --> 18:12.960
I will hand you over

18:13.480 --> 18:14.319
Oh, my God!

18:18.519 --> 18:19.559
What a simple maid!

18:19.920 --> 18:21.359
It's dry

18:21.599 --> 18:22.720
how dare you

18:23.759 --> 18:26.160
Lu Jin accuses Xin of bedding
and seizing the inheritance

18:26.759 --> 18:29.200
Moreover, the entire Lu family had died

18:29.359 --> 18:30.440
You don't have any evidence

18:31.000 --> 18:32.039
It must be slander

18:32.640 --> 18:33.279
Somebody!

18:34.319 --> 18:35.519
His anger 40 times

18:46.920 --> 18:48.119
I'm low key

18:48.319 --> 18:49.519
If my teacher is killed

18:49.519 --> 18:50.960
It would be disrespectful

18:52.759 --> 18:54.400
Regardless of right or wrong

18:54.400 --> 18:55.839
It will overwhelm me first

18:57.480 --> 18:59.880
Multiplication requires skills

19:00.359 --> 19:02.799
Serious right-wingers cannot right-wing

19:03.119 --> 19:04.240
Without years of practice

19:04.480 --> 19:05.319
What do they practice?

19:05.319 --> 19:07.759
Stretch on people forcefully

19:07.759 --> 19:08.759
But it doesn't hurt

19:09.480 --> 19:11.200
It only costs money

19:13.240 --> 19:15.160
This is a good way to make money

19:16.559 --> 19:17.799
He seems to be in the right days

19:17.799 --> 19:20.160
Even multiplication
under the command of money

19:20.599 --> 19:22.079
Don't worry about coverage

19:23.559 --> 19:24.880
I have a plan

19:26.920 --> 19:29.119
Thank you for your help

19:30.079 --> 19:31.240
Once you finish it

19:32.400 --> 19:34.400
I will recover the sinyang for you

19:38.519 --> 19:39.519
Sir, please

19:39.880 --> 19:41.799
Even though I'm being beaten, I have to complain

19:42.720 --> 19:44.519
Kill Mr. Lu

19:45.200 --> 19:46.240
prattle

19:47.200 --> 19:48.079
His anger 60 times

19:49.519 --> 19:52.359
Even if I get beaten to death
I have to seek justice for Mr. Lu

19:52.559 --> 19:54.200
Lu Yuanbao had been dead
for about half a year

19:54.559 --> 19:56.880
Why would you wait until after Luo Jinxin's family
was dead to report it?

19:57.119 --> 19:58.599
When he was alive

19:58.880 --> 20:00.160
How dare I complain

20:00.160 --> 20:01.680
How can I fight against it?

20:01.920 --> 20:03.359
Stop arguing here

20:04.519 --> 20:05.759
Wash it 80 times

20:07.319 --> 20:08.039
my lord

20:08.039 --> 20:09.319
I have an Imperial Scholar to testify

20:09.680 --> 20:10.400
to stop

20:12.519 --> 20:13.559
Who is he?

20:15.880 --> 20:19.359
It's Zhao Yuren

20:19.559 --> 20:21.920
Go ahead if you want to transfer us there

20:21.920 --> 20:25.519
But there is something

20:26.200 --> 20:27.680
You don't want Yamin to know

20:27.799 --> 20:28.839
Mr. Chow

20:29.319 --> 20:31.640
Your monetary unit is 5,000 taels of silver

20:31.640 --> 20:33.119
Not burned in fire

20:33.359 --> 20:34.319
What does the International Organization for Migration say?

20:34.960 --> 20:35.759
I don't know

20:35.759 --> 20:36.519
And also

20:39.079 --> 20:42.400
The textile stuffing accountant
should have been missing

20:43.400 --> 20:45.920
Has the ledger also disappeared?

20:46.680 --> 20:49.400
But I happen to know where she is

20:50.920 --> 20:52.680
Did you even nominate an accountant?

20:54.000 --> 20:55.839
But don't forget your identity

20:57.519 --> 20:59.200
You're just a maid

21:00.559 --> 21:02.759
If the harsh punishment is carried out...

21:02.759 --> 21:04.200
you are right

21:05.400 --> 21:07.119
If you take me to Yemen

21:07.880 --> 21:09.880
You will win the case

21:09.880 --> 21:11.720
I know that

21:12.079 --> 21:13.519
So why are you here?

21:14.359 --> 21:15.519
I know what will happen

21:16.680 --> 21:18.960
The district judge
knows better

21:19.480 --> 21:20.359
permission

21:21.599 --> 21:23.880
Trust, and international organization

21:24.240 --> 21:26.839
Narratives and witnesses

21:27.319 --> 21:28.559
Real or fake

21:28.839 --> 21:30.960
The district judge will know

21:34.319 --> 21:36.720
I've heard the current district judge

21:36.720 --> 21:40.039
He knows better about money

21:40.599 --> 21:41.960
If you are a district judge

21:42.359 --> 21:43.480
I think for sure

21:43.640 --> 21:46.440
Mr. Zhao's case is not simple

21:46.640 --> 21:48.759
The key is to get the benefits

21:49.599 --> 21:50.799
There has to be an amount, right?

21:51.680 --> 21:53.119
Let me help you calculate

21:56.240 --> 21:59.839
5000 taels of silver

22:00.640 --> 22:02.720
And half Hongchun textile mill

22:03.319 --> 22:05.039
If you are the county governor

22:05.839 --> 22:08.240
I would like to order from you
for at least 40,000 taels of silver

22:09.079 --> 22:10.960
This is out of friendship for you

22:11.720 --> 22:14.880
You are of no use at all
in prison

22:15.680 --> 22:17.720
Not to mention
you have to spend a lot of money

22:18.680 --> 22:19.680
I've got an idea

22:19.960 --> 22:22.240
To save you from this trouble

22:31.119 --> 22:31.799
My name is your price

22:32.480 --> 22:33.480
I don't need your money

22:37.319 --> 22:38.039
Lu Che

22:39.079 --> 22:40.559
What on earth are you doing?

22:41.480 --> 22:42.400
Early tomorrow

22:43.200 --> 22:45.559
I will go to Yemen to file a lawsuit

22:46.160 --> 22:46.960
against me?

22:48.200 --> 22:50.559
I'll settle for Lu Genshin

22:50.559 --> 22:52.119
To kill his brother Lu Yuanbao

22:52.119 --> 22:53.599
To seize family property

22:54.680 --> 22:55.319
What?

22:55.799 --> 22:57.920
So, I hope
you can be a witness

22:57.920 --> 23:00.839
To support justice for Mr. Lu Yuanbao

23:01.799 --> 23:03.480
You have physical evidence

23:03.799 --> 23:05.480
From Mr. Lu

23:06.039 --> 23:07.920
Hope you can submit it

23:08.200 --> 23:11.880
If you can be a witness
you will save a large amount of money

23:11.880 --> 23:12.839
Mr. Chow

23:13.240 --> 23:14.480
Isn't this

23:15.240 --> 23:16.240
Good deal?

23:17.440 --> 23:18.200
my lord

23:19.720 --> 23:22.000
Lu Yuanbao and I were friends

23:23.200 --> 23:24.039
Unfortunately

23:25.880 --> 23:27.519
He died too early

23:28.200 --> 23:29.000
Mr. Chow

23:29.960 --> 23:33.519
According to Lu Che,
Lu Yuanbao once told you

23:33.519 --> 23:35.079
That his brother wanted to kill him

23:35.400 --> 23:37.519
During his illness, I visited him

23:38.160 --> 23:39.200
He mentioned that

23:39.279 --> 23:40.559
What did you say?

23:41.319 --> 23:44.160
I thought he was delusional
because of his illness

23:44.880 --> 23:45.799
in addition to

23:46.519 --> 23:48.079
That was his family matter

23:48.480 --> 23:50.079
As an outsider, it is inappropriate

23:50.240 --> 23:51.480
For me to intervene

23:51.480 --> 23:52.799
But I told

23:52.799 --> 23:54.440
Their birth, Lu Zhong

23:54.440 --> 23:55.559
If only I could say anything about it

23:56.480 --> 23:58.680
I asked them to take good care of Mr. Lu

23:59.680 --> 24:01.480
And calm down Mr. Lu

24:01.720 --> 24:02.359
Lu Che

24:03.359 --> 24:05.160
What Mr. Zhao said makes sense

24:05.960 --> 24:08.480
It may be possible

24:08.799 --> 24:10.000
That Mr. Lu had a deception

24:14.400 --> 24:15.119
my lord

24:16.960 --> 24:18.079
Captain Ling

24:19.400 --> 24:20.559
sir

24:20.799 --> 24:22.440
When Lu Yuanbao died

24:22.440 --> 24:25.720
Everyone thought he died of illness

24:25.720 --> 24:28.519
So they buried him immediately

24:34.880 --> 24:36.480
So, you mean...

24:40.240 --> 24:41.799
Exhuming the body

24:42.480 --> 24:43.160
Coroner

24:43.440 --> 24:44.400
What are the results?

24:44.920 --> 24:45.519
my lord

24:45.519 --> 24:47.119
She first tested for poison
with a silver needle

24:47.119 --> 24:48.640
She stuck the needle down my throat

24:48.640 --> 24:50.000
And the chest and abdomen

24:50.000 --> 24:51.759
The tip of the needle has become black

24:52.519 --> 24:53.279
Please take a look

24:57.200 --> 24:59.160
Then I used the bone steam method

24:59.160 --> 25:00.720
All the bones were black

25:00.720 --> 25:02.880
The victim died from the poison

25:18.880 --> 25:19.599
Lu Che

25:20.079 --> 25:22.160
As I said

25:22.960 --> 25:26.640
Mr. Lu was actually poisoned
to death by his younger brother

25:27.039 --> 25:30.119
But his brother's family
was already dead

25:30.359 --> 25:32.240
Revenge came very quickly

25:33.000 --> 25:35.039
The killer died

25:35.039 --> 25:35.640
You...

25:36.839 --> 25:37.359
my lord

25:37.359 --> 25:38.599
Mr. Zhao is here to see you

25:38.599 --> 25:40.759
He knows something relevant to the case

25:40.920 --> 25:41.880
Bring it

25:42.000 --> 25:42.559
Yes

25:43.039 --> 25:44.720
my lord

25:47.839 --> 25:51.359
Why did you come back?

25:52.400 --> 25:53.559
On my way back home

25:54.240 --> 25:55.440
I remembered something strange

25:56.240 --> 25:56.920
Something strange?

25:57.880 --> 25:58.759
What is it?

25:59.279 --> 26:00.000
Here's the thing

26:00.599 --> 26:02.359
Before Mr. Lu's death

26:02.799 --> 26:05.079
He had whipped something into my pawn shop

26:06.559 --> 26:07.400
Here he is

26:08.720 --> 26:09.279
Yes

26:09.920 --> 26:11.880
Mr. Lu asked me to buy that

26:13.119 --> 26:15.240
I almost forgot about it

26:16.160 --> 26:17.599
I was angry at the time

26:18.480 --> 26:20.440
I was curious why he sells things

26:21.279 --> 26:23.039
It was worth only 2000 copper coins

26:23.640 --> 26:26.000
A shopkeeper also found it strange

26:26.160 --> 26:27.079
And he told me that

26:27.079 --> 26:30.440
I just thought
Lu Yuanbao was lost due to illness

26:30.440 --> 26:31.319
She didn't take it seriously

26:32.359 --> 26:35.039
What did Lu Yuanbao do?

26:35.880 --> 26:36.720
I don't know

26:41.480 --> 26:42.319
Mr. Chow

26:42.759 --> 26:44.200
In your workshop

26:44.640 --> 26:47.319
Even an unknown item
could be worth 2,000 copper coins

26:47.319 --> 26:49.559
I think your pawn shop won't last long

26:49.920 --> 26:51.119
I'm serious, sir

26:51.400 --> 26:52.920
When the item has been worn

26:53.519 --> 26:54.599
It was sealed

26:54.960 --> 26:57.480
Mr. Lu himself stamped it

26:57.799 --> 26:59.039
He specifically ordered me

26:59.200 --> 27:01.640
Sold by Mr. Chow's workshop

27:02.039 --> 27:03.160
He claimed that they were his pawns

27:03.480 --> 27:05.480
It could be worth 2000 copper coins
without being detected

27:06.720 --> 27:08.920
So I don't know what's inside it

27:09.440 --> 27:10.200
permission

27:11.519 --> 27:12.480
Let's open the door

27:13.359 --> 27:14.200
Yes sir

27:19.279 --> 27:20.039
my lord

27:20.039 --> 27:21.759
There are two rings on it

27:21.759 --> 27:23.960
One stamp from the store

27:23.960 --> 27:25.039
History is on it

27:25.039 --> 27:27.480
Before the time Lu Yuanbao died

27:27.640 --> 27:28.880
The other seal must be placed

27:28.880 --> 27:31.400
By Liu Yuanbao himself

27:31.400 --> 27:34.319
The dates on the seals are the same

27:35.960 --> 27:36.920
So the seal has already been closed

27:37.759 --> 27:39.559
By Lu Yuanbao

27:39.559 --> 27:40.720
Before his death

27:40.720 --> 27:41.839
Yes sir

27:42.599 --> 27:43.599
open it

27:43.599 --> 27:44.400
Yes sir

28:03.240 --> 28:04.799
I am Lu Yuanbao

28:04.960 --> 28:06.440
From Mo County

28:06.640 --> 28:08.000
In 1568 AD

28:08.000 --> 28:09.440
I came to Du County for work

28:16.960 --> 28:18.559
I'll give it to Mr. Zhao

28:19.000 --> 28:20.240
Justice exists

28:20.559 --> 28:21.559
The law of karma will prevail

28:22.720 --> 28:25.720
I hope you can do me justice

28:26.359 --> 28:29.400
And bring my stupid brother
to justice

28:29.960 --> 28:31.720
Before Lu Yuanbao

28:38.119 --> 28:40.160
Is this his handwriting?

28:41.440 --> 28:42.079
my lord

28:42.319 --> 28:44.599
I have a crush on him

28:45.039 --> 28:46.480
You can check his handwriting

28:46.720 --> 28:48.200
Sign and seal

28:50.519 --> 28:51.680
It's matching

28:53.319 --> 28:55.920
Compare the handwriting on this fan

28:56.119 --> 28:58.680
Handwriting on this

28:58.680 --> 29:00.279
Lacks power

29:02.640 --> 29:04.799
It was definitely written by a sick person

29:07.000 --> 29:08.240
This will is real

29:13.480 --> 29:15.640
Lu Yuanbao is wise

29:17.279 --> 29:18.559
i can't believe

29:18.799 --> 29:21.799
Keep his will in store

29:25.200 --> 29:27.920
This issue is already very clear

29:28.960 --> 29:31.359
Physical evidence and witnesses

29:31.960 --> 29:33.640
And Mr. Chow

29:33.920 --> 29:37.079
A highly respected Imperial scholar
can testify

29:37.519 --> 29:38.400
but

29:39.119 --> 29:41.079
This case looks amazing

29:42.200 --> 29:44.440
It's like a story

29:44.799 --> 29:47.559
This is really unreasonable

29:48.079 --> 29:50.559
He has ups and downs, poignant

29:51.880 --> 29:55.319
A dedicated servant
of justice to his teacher

29:56.319 --> 29:58.599
A generous master
gave his family wealth

29:59.160 --> 30:01.200
The law of karma prevails

30:02.720 --> 30:05.759
In addition, we have a wise judge

30:06.880 --> 30:09.400
Sir, you are wise

30:10.000 --> 30:12.920
Sir, you persevere

30:19.519 --> 30:22.880
The Lu family has a lot of property

30:22.880 --> 30:25.720
Transportation will be very troublesome

30:27.119 --> 30:30.000
Some may refuse to accept it

30:30.680 --> 30:31.799
Which leads to disputes

30:31.799 --> 30:32.480
my lord

30:32.920 --> 30:35.000
We will depend on you in this matter

30:35.599 --> 30:36.279
Lu Che

30:36.559 --> 30:37.279
What is your opinion

30:40.079 --> 30:40.880
my lord

30:41.559 --> 30:43.960
I do not know much

30:44.160 --> 30:46.000
But I know one thing

30:48.640 --> 30:49.720
What is it?

30:51.319 --> 30:52.599
Be grateful

30:57.359 --> 30:58.119
What?

30:59.359 --> 31:00.279
Are we leaving?

31:01.160 --> 31:02.440
Why?

31:06.519 --> 31:07.960
My teacher's family was dead

31:08.400 --> 31:10.519
But the maid gained a fortune

31:10.839 --> 31:14.240
This story will spread
throughout DOE County

31:15.039 --> 31:15.839
Mr. Lu

31:15.839 --> 31:17.519
Just let it be

31:17.519 --> 31:19.559
It's not a big deal

31:20.079 --> 31:21.839
But if everyone in this city

31:22.359 --> 31:24.119
He is jealous of you

31:24.119 --> 31:25.720
It would be a serious matter

31:26.240 --> 31:28.039
After all, we have a lot of secrets

31:28.240 --> 31:30.160
Secrets may be divulged

31:30.440 --> 31:31.200
Three years

31:32.079 --> 31:33.799
We'll be leaving for three years

31:34.559 --> 31:36.359
So we will come back with
new identities

31:45.680 --> 31:46.519
Mr. Lu

31:47.240 --> 31:50.599
I can agree to anything

31:51.680 --> 31:53.519
Except this

31:54.039 --> 31:56.559
First, after all these years

31:56.720 --> 32:00.200
I finally got my head together
and lived a good life

32:00.279 --> 32:02.079
Do you want me to change my name?

32:03.000 --> 32:03.799
I can't do that

32:03.799 --> 32:05.960
Secondly, you know

32:07.039 --> 32:08.680
My mother's health is not good

32:08.799 --> 32:10.799
I can't leave her alone

32:11.079 --> 32:11.759
permission

32:13.559 --> 32:14.440
Just go

32:14.799 --> 32:15.920
And I will stay

32:16.759 --> 32:19.000
I gave you the house

32:20.039 --> 32:23.839
Can't you hire some people
to take care of your mother?

32:26.599 --> 32:27.559
Three years

32:28.279 --> 32:31.839
I don't even know
if my mother will be able to live after three years

32:32.160 --> 32:34.920
I can't miss it
one last time

32:35.680 --> 32:36.440
Chen Wang

32:37.000 --> 32:38.640
Did you gamble again a few days ago?

32:39.559 --> 32:40.960
I have spend a lot of money

32:40.960 --> 32:42.319
Isn't this suspicious?

32:44.799 --> 32:45.480
you go

32:46.400 --> 32:48.200
close your mouth

32:49.839 --> 32:51.839
How much I spend is my business

32:51.839 --> 32:53.079
Don't interfere with this

32:53.519 --> 32:55.720
It doesn't matter, I spent my own money

32:55.720 --> 32:56.920
Who can object?

32:57.599 --> 32:58.480
Furthermore it

32:59.039 --> 33:00.559
Since the fire

33:01.200 --> 33:03.799
We have been here for two months

33:03.799 --> 33:05.279
Two months

33:06.240 --> 33:07.319
I told them

33:08.960 --> 33:09.920
Over the past two months

33:10.279 --> 33:12.000
I was lucky

33:12.000 --> 33:14.680
I won some big packages
in the county city

33:15.160 --> 33:16.319
Who might be suspicious?

33:16.519 --> 33:17.440
You are silly

33:17.680 --> 33:18.480
Sit

33:20.839 --> 33:21.640
Sit

33:28.839 --> 33:30.920
Calm down, we are brothers

33:31.799 --> 33:32.440
Drink

33:39.839 --> 33:40.640
You two drink

33:41.680 --> 33:43.359
I'll check with my mom

33:46.000 --> 33:46.960
Come back early

33:48.920 --> 33:50.440
We haven't finished yet

34:11.156 --> 34:13.329
(in 1609 AH)

34:14.920 --> 34:16.360
If this is true

34:16.840 --> 34:18.239
Judge Wei is the killer

34:18.239 --> 34:19.519
He came back for revenge

34:20.000 --> 34:20.960
Given this

34:20.960 --> 34:22.920
We only have two paths to take

34:23.039 --> 34:26.039
First, we changed our names again
and fled somewhere else

34:26.039 --> 34:26.800
secondly...

34:26.800 --> 34:27.559
Kill him

34:28.119 --> 34:30.800
Just based on an observation
from a fortune teller?

34:31.360 --> 34:32.760
What if he's lying?

34:32.760 --> 34:34.039
Why would he lie?

34:34.599 --> 34:37.000
How did he know about Lu Bu?

34:37.920 --> 34:40.480
makes sense

34:40.480 --> 34:44.239
A new local judge
must meet the local squid

34:44.280 --> 34:45.760
To make communications

34:46.559 --> 34:49.480
Judge Wei has been here
for several months

34:49.639 --> 34:51.840
But I haven't met him

34:53.119 --> 34:53.920
It's weird

34:55.800 --> 34:56.880
This is just weird

34:58.199 --> 35:00.000
But I saw him

35:00.280 --> 35:01.760
Even though it's been 20 years

35:01.760 --> 35:04.280
I simply cannot believe it

35:04.519 --> 35:06.159
It's yours

35:09.480 --> 35:11.280
It's not that you can't believe it

35:12.519 --> 35:14.559
You're hoping for luck

35:19.800 --> 35:21.119
You don't need to panic

35:22.559 --> 35:26.159
On the surface
he still couldn't do anything to us

35:27.639 --> 35:28.599
in the dark

35:31.920 --> 35:33.599
We have a lot of people here

35:35.119 --> 35:36.920
He cannot be close to us

35:38.159 --> 35:39.239
Now, both sides

35:40.840 --> 35:41.960
In trouble

35:42.800 --> 35:44.840
What is there to worry about?

35:45.440 --> 35:46.920
All the time

35:47.719 --> 35:51.320
Our difficulty lies in the fact
that the killer is hiding

35:51.440 --> 35:52.760
We do not know who is being killed

35:52.960 --> 35:54.559
It doesn't matter if it's true or false

35:54.559 --> 35:57.079
Is it that difficult to kill an official?

35:57.920 --> 35:59.400
Liu Shiqi

36:00.679 --> 36:02.559
Kill anyone with one finger

36:03.119 --> 36:05.159
Don't mention
Liu Shiqi again

36:05.760 --> 36:07.440
I can't even protect Zhang Jie

36:08.599 --> 36:10.079
Just let me leave it to me

36:10.679 --> 36:11.400
I am waiting

36:18.840 --> 36:20.599
The killer is very cunning

36:21.960 --> 36:23.960
If you fail

36:24.440 --> 36:26.199
It would be harder to kill him again

36:31.440 --> 36:32.440
do not you trust me?

36:34.079 --> 36:34.960
Liu Shiqi

36:36.079 --> 36:36.960
In an assassination

36:38.679 --> 36:40.440
Do you rely solely on martial arts?

36:41.639 --> 36:44.440
Careful planning
and flexibility are also important

36:44.440 --> 36:45.599
In the two days

36:46.920 --> 36:49.960
All Yamin visitors can't stop you

36:50.440 --> 36:51.920
Except for one man

36:52.440 --> 36:53.960
That man's name is Liuyi San

36:54.880 --> 36:56.079
he is strong

36:56.320 --> 36:58.800
Let's get rid of it first

36:59.199 --> 37:00.320
Mr. Shaw ran away

37:00.880 --> 37:01.599
What?

37:01.880 --> 37:03.559
He left with more than 100 guards

37:03.559 --> 37:04.599
Through the eastern gate

37:04.760 --> 37:05.400
Levi San

37:06.280 --> 37:08.559
Judge Wei orders you
to follow them immediately

37:08.920 --> 37:09.960
To know where they stop

37:09.960 --> 37:11.960
Mail the news here
all the way

37:12.320 --> 37:12.960
Yes

37:13.239 --> 37:15.719
Mr. Xie plans to play tricks

37:16.400 --> 37:17.760
He is pretending and will move slowly

37:20.559 --> 37:22.960
(City gate opens)
Take this with you

37:22.960 --> 37:23.920
In case of breaking news

37:25.079 --> 37:26.239
If the gate is about to close

37:28.920 --> 37:29.800
This will work

37:31.280 --> 37:31.960
Help yourself

37:32.320 --> 37:32.800
Yes

37:35.079 --> 37:36.960
Did Niu Bu Yan leave with him?

37:39.440 --> 37:41.639
Niu Bu Yan was staying
at Mr. Xu's house

37:42.679 --> 37:44.639
I wonder if Mr. Xie took her up on that

37:45.239 --> 37:46.320
What is your plan?

37:46.960 --> 37:47.840
Mr. Song

37:48.440 --> 37:51.639
I'm planning an ambush around Mr. Xie's house
for two days with some guys

37:51.960 --> 37:54.280
If the killer wanted to kill Niu Boyan

37:54.800 --> 37:56.559
We cannot miss this opportunity

37:57.679 --> 37:58.719
How many men do you need?

37:59.320 --> 38:00.280
It's okay during the day

38:00.960 --> 38:01.960
I need more for tonight

38:02.639 --> 38:03.639
Four sides of the house

38:04.280 --> 38:06.800
It can be guarded by five men each

38:07.599 --> 38:08.679
I'll give you 20 men

38:21.519 --> 38:22.079
quickly

38:24.519 --> 38:25.079
Go

38:25.960 --> 38:27.960
Are they really pretending?

38:28.639 --> 38:29.920
How did they travel?

38:30.440 --> 38:31.800
More than 30 km in half a day?

38:32.960 --> 38:34.400
Lu San left

38:34.599 --> 38:37.840
The righteous veil has been withdrawn
from Yamin

38:37.840 --> 38:38.599
Thanks

38:47.679 --> 38:48.559
Did you hear him?

38:59.440 --> 39:00.440
Judge Wei

39:00.440 --> 39:02.119
Please sit down

39:09.119 --> 39:10.679
Since she took office

39:10.960 --> 39:13.360
I have never been involved
in criminal justice

39:16.239 --> 39:18.199
I appreciate your dedication

39:18.960 --> 39:20.159
You look different

39:21.440 --> 39:23.079
ususally

39:23.280 --> 39:24.920
Today is different

39:25.440 --> 39:26.559
what is the difference?

39:27.599 --> 39:28.760
You'll know tomorrow

39:34.199 --> 39:34.760
here

39:41.239 --> 39:43.840
Before I took office, I heard

39:44.199 --> 39:46.079
That Song Zhongqiu was the judge here

39:46.440 --> 39:47.960
I was happy

39:49.079 --> 39:51.360
I think I can learn poetry
and calligraphy from you

39:51.880 --> 39:53.199
Are you here

39:53.800 --> 39:55.639
To talk about poetry and calligraphy?

39:56.719 --> 39:57.960
I want to ask about a word

39:59.559 --> 40:00.400
Any one?

40:03.800 --> 40:04.440
Cruelty

40:10.800 --> 40:11.880
You are very frank

40:12.960 --> 40:14.440
I used to work in DOE County

40:15.159 --> 40:16.760
For 20 years

40:17.199 --> 40:19.639
No one ever mentioned this

40:20.760 --> 40:21.960
You don't want to talk about it?

40:22.239 --> 40:22.920
not really

40:24.360 --> 40:26.519
Others might think
I don't want to talk about it

40:26.519 --> 40:28.440
But I don't actually mind

40:30.880 --> 40:32.280
So I'm just ears

40:32.880 --> 40:37.760
There are countless numbers of victims
in this world

40:38.440 --> 40:41.559
But absolute justice never happened

40:42.159 --> 40:43.199
What do you mean by that?

40:43.199 --> 40:44.760
You may not know

40:44.880 --> 40:47.440
There is not a single window in the prison

40:48.119 --> 40:49.239
You can't tell that day and night

40:49.480 --> 40:51.199
But you can still feel

40:52.519 --> 40:53.400
That days

40:56.400 --> 40:57.719
Pass

40:59.760 --> 41:01.119
How can you see it?

41:02.159 --> 41:04.480
You can watch for your tortured chop

41:04.519 --> 41:05.639
Slowly rot

41:08.920 --> 41:10.119
I was thinking

41:12.159 --> 41:13.719
There was a threshold
between life and death

41:15.360 --> 41:16.519
Life on the side

41:17.519 --> 41:18.880
And death on the other side

41:20.559 --> 41:22.079
Just a preliminary thing

41:22.159 --> 41:23.559
But then I found out

41:23.679 --> 41:25.920
Death can be very slow

41:26.079 --> 41:29.320
People may die a little

41:29.519 --> 41:30.719
one day

41:32.480 --> 41:33.599
The prison door is open

41:34.079 --> 41:35.599
And someone will come and tell you

41:36.719 --> 41:37.800
That's your case

41:41.760 --> 41:42.639
It was overturned

41:50.159 --> 41:51.280
But by this time

41:51.639 --> 41:53.039
You're half dead already

41:53.519 --> 41:55.320
Half of you have become a ghost

41:55.679 --> 41:57.199
And you can't go back
to being a human

42:00.199 --> 42:02.039
You are half human

42:02.039 --> 42:03.800
wild

42:04.679 --> 42:05.519
Judge Wei

42:08.079 --> 42:09.280
Justice that comes too late

42:12.559 --> 42:13.880
Not justice

42:20.719 --> 42:21.400
Sangang

42:23.320 --> 42:23.880
Sangang

42:27.199 --> 42:27.840
what is wrong

42:29.119 --> 42:32.920
Are you disturbed by something?

42:36.360 --> 42:37.880
permission

42:39.400 --> 42:40.239
You were right

42:40.800 --> 42:41.599
What happened?

42:41.880 --> 42:42.639
I believe

42:43.320 --> 42:44.480
Our grievances

42:46.239 --> 42:47.440
Not from prison

42:49.599 --> 42:52.599
I was known as a top talent

42:53.760 --> 42:55.559
Famous for your painting
and calligraphy

42:56.000 --> 42:56.920
But I was afraid

42:57.119 --> 42:59.159
Your right hand
cannot take the Registry now

43:00.039 --> 43:02.480
Is this the biggest injustice to you?

43:02.760 --> 43:06.039
When I got home

43:06.239 --> 43:08.159
The court had overturned your case

43:10.039 --> 43:13.000
But no one believed
that you were wronged

43:13.239 --> 43:15.079
They all spoke

43:15.079 --> 43:17.039
About the amount you spent

43:17.039 --> 43:18.320
Who did you nominate?

43:19.239 --> 43:20.719
How did you use your prayers?

43:21.000 --> 43:22.480
To avoid a lawsuit

43:22.880 --> 43:23.719
Mr. Song

43:23.880 --> 43:26.159
Isn't this unfair?

43:26.159 --> 43:28.760
Is it harsher than a prison sentence?

43:29.199 --> 43:30.880
You had a good girlfriend

43:30.880 --> 43:32.400
He studied with you from an early age

43:32.480 --> 43:33.559
You are prepared for exams together

43:33.559 --> 43:36.119
Close like brothers

43:36.119 --> 43:37.679
You cannot bear the punishment

43:37.679 --> 43:38.840
and until

43:39.039 --> 43:41.320
He used his death
to prove his innocence

43:42.079 --> 43:42.760
Mr. Song

43:43.000 --> 43:46.039
Could it be the greatest injustice
in your heart?

43:46.719 --> 43:48.000
in my opinion

43:48.159 --> 43:50.039
This is not the most unfair

43:50.239 --> 43:52.880
You cannot live in peace

43:53.719 --> 43:55.760
Even if the court has cleared your name

43:55.880 --> 43:58.039
I restored your honor
and gave you the high position

43:58.559 --> 44:00.920
Your right hand has become useless

44:01.000 --> 44:03.920
People still think you were nominated

44:04.159 --> 44:07.079
Your dear friend died resentful

44:07.239 --> 44:10.159
However those who reported in court

44:10.440 --> 44:12.800
Those who caused your disability

44:12.800 --> 44:15.239
Those who are busy in infighting

44:15.360 --> 44:16.760
And those who accuse you

44:16.760 --> 44:18.960
By bribery

44:19.400 --> 44:20.199
None of them have ever

44:21.880 --> 44:24.119
No punishment

44:24.760 --> 44:25.760
Mr. Song

44:29.119 --> 44:31.000
It's not just about injustice

44:31.719 --> 44:32.880
You just don't know

44:34.760 --> 44:36.400
How do you take revenge?

44:40.840 --> 44:42.440
I was constipated.

44:42.440 --> 44:44.079
My stool is hard like rocks.

44:44.639 --> 44:45.840
Sanjing.

44:51.760 --> 44:52.360
Sangang

44:52.679 --> 44:54.719
It's okay if you don't want to tell me

44:54.840 --> 44:58.639
However, you won't be alone

45:02.480 --> 45:03.440
I believe

45:04.880 --> 45:06.719
The reason you became a judge

45:07.719 --> 45:09.360
It is that you are a designer

45:09.360 --> 45:12.199
To solve every issue for justice

45:12.519 --> 45:14.960
I have been a judge for 12 years

45:15.360 --> 45:16.599
I saw

45:17.039 --> 45:18.519
Lots of pending issues

45:25.039 --> 45:26.519
This terrible

45:27.320 --> 45:28.519
20 years ago

45:28.519 --> 45:30.360
Doe County has been hit by a lot of fire

45:31.400 --> 45:32.880
Have you heard of that?

45:38.320 --> 45:40.719
So you were here
for the fire 20 years ago

45:42.440 --> 45:44.039
I felt upset

45:44.039 --> 45:45.960
I looked into it during my time on the run

45:45.960 --> 45:47.760
It's almost over

45:48.719 --> 45:51.800
But my writing is clumsy

45:52.239 --> 45:55.079
I hide it in the box in my study

45:55.599 --> 45:56.840
I do this to make myself happy

45:59.559 --> 46:00.679
But after I finish writing

46:00.920 --> 46:02.840
I hope you can review it

46:03.360 --> 46:04.199
at that time

46:06.440 --> 46:07.440
Please give me your advice

46:07.760 --> 46:08.960
Amol only

46:09.559 --> 46:11.239
You don't leave another case hanging

46:13.280 --> 46:14.400
What can I do for you?

46:16.559 --> 46:17.840
I'm in your serves

46:23.440 --> 46:24.360
No hurry

46:26.079 --> 46:27.239
you will know

46:28.000 --> 46:28.880
tomorrow

46:34.800 --> 46:35.440
Please

46:46.920 --> 46:47.519
my friend

46:48.039 --> 46:48.679
my lord

46:48.800 --> 46:49.400
Any vacancies?

46:49.840 --> 46:50.280
my lord

46:50.320 --> 46:51.440
I am really sorry

46:51.440 --> 46:52.800
Imperial scholar

46:52.800 --> 46:54.239
All rooms are booked for tonight

46:54.239 --> 46:55.360
Also book your rooms?

46:55.559 --> 46:56.079
Yes

46:56.599 --> 46:57.840
He has three hostels

46:58.079 --> 46:59.239
He came with a lot of people

46:59.440 --> 47:00.199
Sorry

47:00.280 --> 47:01.679
You have a long time to come

47:01.800 --> 47:03.239
There is another hostel

47:08.000 --> 47:09.199
Take care, sir

47:21.280 --> 47:22.519
Ma'am, I want two cakes

47:22.760 --> 47:23.280
Good

47:26.679 --> 47:27.320
my lord

47:28.159 --> 47:29.639
San is not enough?

47:29.639 --> 47:30.559
They outnumber us

47:30.800 --> 47:32.239
Liu San can't monitor them alone

47:33.599 --> 47:34.679
If I'm not by your side

47:35.559 --> 47:36.920
I'm always worried

47:38.039 --> 47:40.679
I'm asking you
to watch the most anxious person

47:40.920 --> 47:42.960
But Chewie

47:43.239 --> 47:43.960
Do you mean it?

47:44.880 --> 47:46.280
He went to Mr. Xie's house?

47:49.199 --> 47:50.320
Didn't see this coming

47:50.719 --> 47:52.400
How did he find that donkey?

47:54.760 --> 47:57.079
Ko Sanqing is very planned

47:57.480 --> 48:00.039
I'm afraid he's setting a trap

48:00.280 --> 48:03.039
With Mr. Xie to take revenge on his master

48:03.639 --> 48:04.800
As long as we don't act

48:05.599 --> 48:06.760
What can they do?

48:06.960 --> 48:09.440
Mr. Shiqi has Liu Shiqi by his side

48:11.320 --> 48:12.760
Doesn't he fear us?

48:13.400 --> 48:14.559
Zhang Jie died

48:14.559 --> 48:15.639
permission

48:15.639 --> 48:18.199
Mr. Shiqi will keep Liu Shiqi
by his side to protect himself

48:19.280 --> 48:19.880
Judge Wei

48:20.239 --> 48:22.000
I feel like this is unsafe

48:22.119 --> 48:23.360
Is there any other way?

48:25.599 --> 48:26.679
There is no other way

48:26.960 --> 48:28.400
I don't really have a choice

48:31.760 --> 48:32.440
Judge Wei

48:33.119 --> 48:34.679
Without saving me

48:35.199 --> 48:36.599
I would die in prison

48:36.960 --> 48:37.960
I can risk my life

48:38.159 --> 48:39.639
for you

48:39.880 --> 48:42.880
But I can't leave you in danger

48:43.119 --> 48:45.159
Where is the danger?

48:47.519 --> 48:49.280
Are you afraid that
I can't finish my policy?

48:49.280 --> 48:50.000
no

48:50.821 --> 48:53.920
(interrupt check)

48:54.559 --> 48:57.519
(I am Wei Feng Shi,
District Judge of Du County)

48:57.840 --> 49:00.280
(I am incompetent at work)

49:04.599 --> 49:06.360
(Since taking office in Dou Province)

49:06.639 --> 49:08.960
(I saw repeated killings)
without evidence.

49:09.840 --> 49:11.320
(On the seventh day of October,)

49:11.639 --> 49:15.119
(Cheng Yiqi, a distinguished doctor, came
to confess on his own

49:15.199 --> 49:16.639
(He made his confession)

49:17.559 --> 49:18.440
(Based on his confession,)

49:18.840 --> 49:20.920
(20 years ago, Lu Che)
The owner of the Lu family

49:20.920 --> 49:23.199
(He forced him to poison his master
to poison his master Lu Yuan Bao

49:23.440 --> 49:27.559
(Lu Che set the fire and killed Lu Jinchen
(Liu Yuanbao's brother and his family)

49:28.039 --> 49:29.639
(He usurped his property)

49:30.239 --> 49:32.119
(Lu Qi changed his name to Xue Qi)

49:32.400 --> 49:34.320
(He has many accomplices)

49:34.679 --> 49:37.280
(murder series in du county)

49:37.280 --> 49:39.119
(Everything is done by his gang)

49:39.639 --> 49:42.119
(It all started
with Ling Wuji, Captain Ling)

49:42.679 --> 49:44.760
(Ling Wuji was one)
of Xue Qi's partners

49:44.760 --> 49:47.000
(He was blackmailing Xu Qi)

49:47.440 --> 49:48.079
(since then)

49:48.440 --> 49:50.960
(Xie Qi began a series of killings for his secret.
)

49:51.840 --> 49:52.480
Make your mark

49:53.519 --> 49:54.480
(Testimony of Cheng Yiqi)
(Cheng Yiqi claimed)

49:54.679 --> 49:56.480
(He feared he was killed)

49:56.719 --> 49:58.280
(So ​​he chose to confess)

49:58.280 --> 50:00.800
(to avoid death in prison)

50:01.440 --> 50:03.920
(Yawang Temple)
(His confession seemed ridiculous)

50:04.239 --> 50:06.039
(So ​​I thought he was crazy)

50:06.320 --> 50:08.440
(She kept his confession)
and led him away

50:08.960 --> 50:10.360
(However, after three days)

50:10.719 --> 50:13.000
(Zheng Yiqi was killed)

50:13.559 --> 50:15.400
(I felt terrified)

50:15.519 --> 50:17.639
(Such a person could actually be exposed to such a disease)
(I realized the mistake I made)

50:18.000 --> 50:19.760
(Wrong Ghost Worship)
(Later, Zhao Yuren was killed)

50:20.079 --> 50:23.360
(A confession was also found
at his house)

50:23.480 --> 50:25.119
(Zhao Yuren's confession)
(Identified Xie Qi as the killer)

50:25.800 --> 50:27.880
(presumed killed)

50:27.880 --> 50:29.039
(before confession)

50:30.559 --> 50:32.159
(This issue is huge)

50:32.320 --> 50:34.519
(Xie Qi is an imperial scholar)

50:34.519 --> 50:36.320
(I have no concrete evidence)

50:36.320 --> 50:37.920
(So, I should report it first)

50:37.920 --> 50:40.079
(And collect evidence secretly)

50:50.239 --> 50:50.880
Somebody

50:53.599 --> 50:54.440
drinker

50:55.119 --> 50:55.719
Drink

50:59.599 --> 51:00.440
Drink more

51:00.840 --> 51:02.440
Let's go

51:02.679 --> 51:03.440
Drink

51:08.320 --> 51:09.119
Ko Sangg

51:11.920 --> 51:13.559
Mr. Song is looking for you

51:13.960 --> 51:14.559
Why?

51:14.920 --> 51:15.719
He didn't tell me

51:15.840 --> 51:16.719
Let's go

51:17.119 --> 51:18.920
He just wants to see you

51:23.239 --> 51:23.880
Let's go

51:34.679 --> 51:35.840
my lord

51:35.920 --> 51:37.480
Everything you said is the truth

51:38.000 --> 51:39.079
I do not know anything

51:39.079 --> 51:40.880
I didn't do anything, sir

51:40.880 --> 51:41.760
You can leave now

51:42.280 --> 51:43.159
let him go

51:43.840 --> 51:44.400
Yes

51:45.320 --> 51:46.039
my lord

51:46.639 --> 51:48.000
Did you catch the real culprit?

51:49.760 --> 51:50.440
almost

51:54.840 --> 51:55.960
very soon

51:55.960 --> 51:57.079
Thank you

51:57.559 --> 52:00.320
A few days ago
when Niu Boyan left the city

52:00.480 --> 52:02.519
Unlike Zhang Jiechu
who was hidden in his cart

52:02.519 --> 52:04.519
There was also a supervisor
Leo, right?

52:04.960 --> 52:05.599
Yes

52:06.519 --> 52:08.199
When I captured Zhang Jiechu

52:08.280 --> 52:09.280
help

52:09.559 --> 52:10.599
the person

52:10.599 --> 52:12.360
Who attacked Lan San using lime arts

52:12.719 --> 52:14.039
It was also Leo

52:15.000 --> 52:15.639
Yes

52:16.639 --> 52:18.400
Liu San is watching Mr. Xie

52:18.400 --> 52:20.880
The skilled men followed you
to monitor Shui's residence

52:21.039 --> 52:22.239
I called the fascia a while ago

52:23.639 --> 52:25.840
There are only five couriers left
in Yamen

52:25.840 --> 52:27.239
Some of them were already drunk

52:27.679 --> 52:28.559
If Leo suddenly comes

52:28.559 --> 52:30.559
To assassinate Judge Wei

52:30.719 --> 52:31.800
What will happen?

52:32.760 --> 52:34.559
Why would he kill Judge Wei?

52:35.920 --> 52:37.159
Because Judge Wee

52:43.440 --> 52:45.000
He is a serial killer

52:45.880 --> 52:47.000
I drew it

52:47.159 --> 52:48.159
With my left hand

52:48.559 --> 52:50.519
It's not very lively but okay

52:51.239 --> 52:52.480
This is Judge Wei

52:56.519 --> 52:57.360
Mr. Shi

53:14.639 --> 53:15.320
permission

53:16.599 --> 53:17.880
This is the killer

53:18.760 --> 53:20.440
I showed it to Si Baozhou

53:21.239 --> 53:21.920
He said

53:22.480 --> 53:24.760
This was the customer
who ordered the stone mill from

53:27.679 --> 53:29.840
Those who were stolen
because of the monkey demon

53:30.199 --> 53:30.880
this

53:31.559 --> 53:33.559
It was the antique dealer who came to them

53:35.320 --> 53:36.519
Could this be accurate?

53:37.800 --> 53:38.719
probably

53:39.599 --> 53:42.000
I painted nine pictures

53:47.480 --> 53:49.800
They are all servants
and messengers in Yemen

53:50.800 --> 53:53.119
When the killer used the flying knife
to deliver a message, I was sure it was him

53:54.079 --> 53:55.679
The killer had an insider in Al-Yamin

53:57.159 --> 53:59.559
So I gathered them together in the two days

53:59.559 --> 54:00.920
I asked them one by one

54:00.920 --> 54:02.599
Seven of them could not prove

54:02.599 --> 54:03.960
Where were they?

54:03.960 --> 54:05.679
I drew pictures for each of them

54:06.039 --> 54:07.239
To let Si Baozhou identify him

54:08.239 --> 54:09.360
But none of them were buyers

54:10.840 --> 54:13.199
I haven't drawn for a long time

54:14.000 --> 54:15.480
In fact, it piqued my interest

54:16.639 --> 54:19.079
So I pulled two other people
who had nothing to do with the case

54:19.079 --> 54:20.239
Just for fun

54:20.639 --> 54:21.639
But unexpectedly

54:24.119 --> 54:25.480
This is getting to be a lot of fun

54:26.320 --> 54:27.719
Only two pictures

54:28.199 --> 54:29.920
Before I released Zhang Jizhou

54:29.920 --> 54:31.679
She submitted a special report to Judge Wei

54:31.880 --> 54:32.599
Certainly enough

54:33.159 --> 54:34.320
Judge Wei and Mr. Shi

54:34.960 --> 54:36.760
Yamin left
in civilian clothes very quickly

54:37.280 --> 54:38.760
What should we do now?

54:39.760 --> 54:41.880
I think Judge Wei found out

54:42.960 --> 54:44.800
That Mr. Shweh left the district
to confuse him

54:45.360 --> 54:46.679
So he decided to go with him

54:46.679 --> 54:48.239
He asked Liuyi San to follow him

54:48.239 --> 54:49.280
He left the door open

54:49.760 --> 54:50.800
Leave the door open?

54:51.840 --> 54:52.760
Why?

54:53.199 --> 54:54.519
He wants that killer

54:56.960 --> 54:57.760
To come and kill him

54:58.159 --> 55:00.039
So he set up a trap

55:01.880 --> 55:03.000
To catch that killer

55:03.800 --> 55:05.199
Then extract a confession

55:08.239 --> 55:09.840
It's too much trouble

55:10.400 --> 55:12.159
If that killer kills him

55:12.880 --> 55:14.440
He wouldn't need confession anymore

55:20.719 --> 55:21.880
(I learned)

55:21.880 --> 55:24.760
(Xie Qi has many bandits)

55:24.760 --> 55:26.000
(And the famous thieves)

55:26.679 --> 55:28.719
(A few days ago, the bandits sent a message
with a flying knife)

55:28.719 --> 55:30.119
(to confuse people)

55:30.800 --> 55:32.199
(Yemen is under heavy guard)

55:32.199 --> 55:33.760
(But they come and go as they please)

55:35.360 --> 55:37.239
(I'm afraid)

55:37.239 --> 55:38.400
(from getting hurt)

55:38.920 --> 55:40.920
(So, I left this message)

55:43.679 --> 55:45.400
(If you were really killed)

55:45.920 --> 55:48.159
(The killer must be Xie Qi)

55:49.800 --> 55:51.639
(I'm willing to trade my life)

55:51.639 --> 55:53.360
(to enforce laws)

55:53.360 --> 55:54.719
(and justice)

55:55.280 --> 55:56.639
(This is what I'm after)

55:57.079 --> 55:58.519
(I don't regret it)

56:00.119 --> 56:01.519
Judge Wei has a plan

56:02.840 --> 56:04.280
Once Mr. Xie assassinates an official

56:05.599 --> 56:07.519
Regardless of his identity

56:07.519 --> 56:08.599
And his great wealth

56:09.239 --> 56:10.199
It will be over

56:12.280 --> 56:14.039
He tried to die with Mr. Xie

56:15.719 --> 56:17.360
Does he have to do that?

56:18.199 --> 56:20.000
He is determined to get revenge

56:26.480 --> 56:28.079
He can do anything for that

56:28.639 --> 56:30.679
If Judge Wei is the killer

56:31.599 --> 56:33.320
Captain Ling was killed by Hu

56:35.199 --> 56:36.679
He is your enemy

56:41.039 --> 56:42.599
I'm going to Xie's house now

56:42.920 --> 56:44.440
To bring them back

56:45.440 --> 56:46.239
Wait a minute

56:48.880 --> 56:51.320
It will alert people

56:51.440 --> 56:53.719
That's why you only brought me back

56:54.840 --> 56:55.719
Mr. Song

56:56.159 --> 56:57.119
what do you want to do?

56:58.079 --> 56:59.199
what do you want to do?

57:02.000 --> 57:02.679
Somebody

57:04.880 --> 57:06.440
Grab Choi

57:16.039 --> 57:17.519
I took the note

57:18.519 --> 57:20.119
On that sanctuary

57:20.119 --> 57:23.039
When did you know
that Judge Wei was the killer?

57:23.400 --> 57:24.760
Before you do

57:25.840 --> 57:27.719
But you were pretending

57:32.039 --> 57:32.960
Originally

57:35.280 --> 57:36.639
I didn't want to do anything

57:36.639 --> 57:38.239
To watch it

57:38.920 --> 57:40.679
If that killer comes tonight

57:40.679 --> 57:41.639
And he will succeed

57:44.639 --> 57:46.159
You will take revenge on your master

57:50.559 --> 57:53.280
I will take Judge Wei's decision

57:53.280 --> 57:54.239
For evidence

57:54.599 --> 57:56.400
To request the order from Nitai Yamin

57:56.719 --> 57:58.039
To arrest Mr. Xie

58:02.039 --> 58:02.920
now

58:04.119 --> 58:05.679
We should call him Lu Che

58:07.000 --> 58:08.199
I will also hold the New Boyan

58:09.159 --> 58:09.960
So

58:11.639 --> 58:14.199
Revenge
will end with the Lu family

58:22.119 --> 58:23.599
What is your opinion

58:29.039 --> 58:30.719
Chewie, I ask you

58:36.239 --> 58:37.960
Seems fair

58:41.880 --> 58:42.639
fair?

58:48.599 --> 58:49.119
but

58:51.239 --> 58:52.239
do you know

58:53.400 --> 58:55.239
What is true fairness?

58:59.639 --> 59:00.519
permission

59:01.760 --> 59:03.159
I had a friend who died

59:04.119 --> 59:05.119
He committed suicide

59:06.360 --> 59:07.679
But immediately after his death

59:08.320 --> 59:09.960
The case was cancelled

59:10.199 --> 59:13.519
So I wrote him a very long blessing

59:13.679 --> 59:15.119
I wanted him to know

59:15.920 --> 59:17.760
That his name has been cleansed

59:18.880 --> 59:20.159
It was a stupid day

59:20.519 --> 59:21.760
I thought it was him

59:22.320 --> 59:23.800
It was going to rain

59:25.320 --> 59:26.920
I just waited in silence

59:27.320 --> 59:28.679
Waiting for him to tell me

59:30.920 --> 59:32.480
He can rest in peace

59:37.880 --> 59:39.079
And waiting for him to tell me

59:44.719 --> 59:45.880
That he could be reincarnated

59:47.119 --> 59:48.679
I kept waiting until it became a shade

59:49.440 --> 59:51.119
But nothing happened

59:51.679 --> 59:53.360
Not even a drop of rain

59:53.599 --> 59:54.920
So I realized

59:55.800 --> 59:57.039
He died

59:57.719 --> 01:00:00.800
He can see

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:02.480
And I don't hear anything

01:00:03.679 --> 01:00:05.000
And I wrote that wine

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:09.360
Only for myself

01:00:10.239 --> 01:00:13.159
I fooled myself with it

01:00:16.239 --> 01:00:18.800
Judge Wei
has a 20-year-old grievance

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.159
No matter what

01:00:20.519 --> 01:00:21.800
I have to keep him alive

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:24.559
I need him to see those injustices

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.880
It can be settled

01:00:27.239 --> 01:00:28.360
permission?

01:00:29.079 --> 01:00:30.519
I will do justice

01:00:37.639 --> 01:00:38.800
To Captain Ling

01:00:39.719 --> 01:00:41.400
Judge Wei
is a rank seven official

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:43.880
Judge at a lower level

01:00:45.519 --> 01:00:46.960
The killer is the district judge

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:50.320
Can you do justice?

01:00:52.159 --> 01:00:53.840
For Captain Ling?

01:00:54.159 --> 01:00:55.159
I can

01:01:01.679 --> 01:01:03.440
You should think about it

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:06.480
If your plan with Mr. Xie is successful

01:01:10.239 --> 01:01:12.000
What will you owe?

01:01:13.679 --> 01:01:15.159
Can you pay for it?

01:01:34.119 --> 01:01:35.079
Judge Wei

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.000
Mr. Song?

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:41.719
what's going on

01:01:41.719 --> 01:01:42.639
This is urgent

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.039
please forgive me

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:45.119
What do you do?

01:01:45.239 --> 01:01:45.880
how dare you!

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:47.960
His Majesty the Emperor appointed me

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.559
Fifth-level official

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:51.559
The situation is urgent

01:01:51.559 --> 01:01:52.320
Judge Wei

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:54.159
I'm sorry about this

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:39.880
permission

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:41.400
Nothing I fear

01:02:42.159 --> 01:02:44.119
Senseless killer

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.880
I do as he loves me

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:47.119
If you get caught

01:02:47.119 --> 01:02:48.159
We will not call a man

01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:58.679
to stop

01:03:02.159 --> 01:03:03.280
Please

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:05.760
You can kill me

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:09.159
But you can't insult me ​​like that

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:14.039
to speak

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:17.519
Why did you kill Judge Wei?

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.679
Someone gave me 500 taels of silver

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:21.320
from?

01:03:22.679 --> 01:03:23.639
I don't know

01:03:27.039 --> 01:03:27.679
my lord

01:03:28.599 --> 01:03:30.159
I have to take him here for questioning

01:03:31.639 --> 01:03:32.719
I'll go with you

01:03:49.199 --> 01:03:49.920
Mr. Song

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:51.599
Mr. Song

01:03:51.599 --> 01:03:52.599
Judge Wei

01:03:52.599 --> 01:03:53.159
quickly

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:32.119
Judge Wei

01:04:34.679 --> 01:04:35.840
why did you come here?

01:04:40.119 --> 01:04:41.639
The injustice is terrible

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:48.679
your justice

01:04:51.639 --> 01:04:52.400
It can be done

01:05:01.079 --> 01:05:03.079
I envy you

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:05.760
I know who you are

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.679
Why didn't you die?

01:06:11.639 --> 01:06:13.039
I was supposed to die

01:06:19.119 --> 01:06:20.639
But now I can't die

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:28.159
Justice must be done

01:06:29.199 --> 01:06:30.320
You got justice for me

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.039
And I will get justice for you

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:55.519
Sangang

01:06:56.239 --> 01:06:58.199
What are you hiding from me?

01:06:59.159 --> 01:07:01.239
I lied on you

01:07:01.719 --> 01:07:04.400
I found the note on the donkeys

01:07:05.039 --> 01:07:06.199
Written here

01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:11.119
Judge Wei Ho Lu is with you

01:07:12.079 --> 01:07:13.000
he did not die

01:07:13.199 --> 01:07:14.599
He's back for revenge

01:07:15.599 --> 01:07:16.719
do you mean

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:20.760
Judge Wei is the killer?

01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:26.280
I can't deal with Judge Wei

01:07:27.679 --> 01:07:29.159
So I found Mr. Shaw

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:31.360
And tell him about it

01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:33.239
I wanted to at first

01:07:37.719 --> 01:07:38.800
to use it

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:42.199
To take revenge on my teacher

01:07:43.199 --> 01:07:43.920
So, you know

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:47.000
Something was going to happen tonight

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:50.000
So you intentionally shift our perspective?

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:07.800
This is my idea

01:08:08.719 --> 01:08:10.760
I was the one who killed Mr. Song

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:14.440
Mr. Song was killed

01:08:16.079 --> 01:08:17.079
Captain Shea

01:08:19.439 --> 01:08:21.079
And other brothers

01:08:23.119 --> 01:08:25.159
I killed them all

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:28.279
Sangang

01:08:30.399 --> 01:08:32.520
Sangeng, don't cry anymore

01:08:36.399 --> 01:08:38.199
We have to think about what we should do next

01:08:43.439 --> 01:08:44.680
I don't know

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:48.920
I really don't know

01:08:50.479 --> 01:08:52.079
My teacher died

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:56.079
And Mr. Song died too

01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:01.720
I don't know who I should ask

01:10:09.439 --> 01:10:10.039
do not do

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:13.399
This is it

01:10:15.119 --> 01:10:16.560
For Mr. Song and others

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:45.600
Sangig

01:10:47.359 --> 01:10:48.960
I've thought about it carefully

01:10:49.399 --> 01:10:50.560
I found something

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:55.720
What is the matter?

01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:59.760
Now, we are the ones
making the decisions

01:11:00.239 --> 01:11:01.600
Whether Judge Wei

01:11:02.159 --> 01:11:03.560
Or Mr. Shawiya

01:11:04.239 --> 01:11:06.000
They are all trapped

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:08.880
Neither of them can do anything to the other

01:11:09.359 --> 01:11:10.960
The key now is

01:11:11.279 --> 01:11:12.399
He is the one we should help

01:11:14.039 --> 01:11:15.279
We are so important?

01:11:16.359 --> 01:11:17.239
naturally

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000
from one side

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:28.319
He's the killer we need to catch

01:11:29.039 --> 01:11:31.600
Judge Wei killed five people

01:11:32.399 --> 01:11:33.800
Including that killer

01:11:34.159 --> 01:11:34.880
Six in total

01:11:35.039 --> 01:11:36.760
And kill your master

01:11:41.319 --> 01:11:42.159
on the other side

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:45.000
He is Mr. Shaw

01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:46.760
That is, Lu Che

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:49.239
He slaughtered the entire Lu family

01:11:49.439 --> 01:11:50.720
He also killed Ms. Lin

01:11:51.159 --> 01:11:52.439
And Mr. Song

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.359
They are both killers

01:11:58.039 --> 01:11:59.359
Where is justice?

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:00.680
Sangang

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:05.800
Actually you know what to do

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:07.560
But my teacher

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.239
Whenever I don't know

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:25.880
What do I do

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:28.640
I will ask myself

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
What will my teacher do?

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.000
But this time

01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:39.920
I can't ask

01:12:44.279 --> 01:12:46.600
I can't ask what choice he will make

01:12:48.319 --> 01:12:49.840
Captain Ling had already made a decision

01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:58.800
But he made a mistake

01:13:22.279 --> 01:13:23.239
you are right

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:25.319
Shichong

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:28.840
you are right

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:32.520
Let's go

01:13:34.319 --> 01:13:35.039
where?

01:13:37.159 --> 01:13:38.359
I have an idea

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:39.800
But we have to act quickly

01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:42.359
It will be difficult when the day break is over

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:05.640
Understood

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:07.520
I understood too

01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:08.279
Let's go

01:14:16.119 --> 01:14:17.720
Liu Shichi had done it

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:19.560
Are you ready?

01:14:20.359 --> 01:14:22.479
That man died?

01:14:27.439 --> 01:14:29.039
But Liu Shi Ke did not return

01:14:29.039 --> 01:14:30.680
Many people were killed in Yamin

01:14:31.159 --> 01:14:32.720
He'll cause trouble
if he comes back here

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:34.479
This is correct

01:14:35.439 --> 01:14:36.119
Fair enough

01:14:36.439 --> 01:14:37.119
Let's go

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:39.159
where are you going?

01:14:40.439 --> 01:14:41.720
Didn't Mr. Xie tell you?

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:43.720
Tell me what?

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
After such a big accident

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:48.720
Is it okay to stay here?

01:14:49.479 --> 01:14:50.920
I must hide

01:14:51.279 --> 01:14:52.520
Mr. Shaw entrusted me

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:54.520
To accompany you out of town

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:55.520
To meet him

01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:57.319
The city gates have not opened yet

01:15:00.479 --> 01:15:02.039
So, that's why he asked me
to accompany you

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:06.720
Let's leave now

01:15:17.159 --> 01:15:17.720
What?

01:15:18.239 --> 01:15:19.199
Want to take some people

01:15:19.199 --> 01:15:20.439
To protect you along the way?

01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:23.319
Forget it

01:15:24.239 --> 01:15:26.960
More people will draw attention

01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:28.640
good

01:15:29.199 --> 01:15:30.720
I can't take out a lot of people

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:32.960
I'm not worried
you'll play any tricks

01:15:34.239 --> 01:15:37.079
Now, we're in the same boat

01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:40.640
We are all in this together

01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:50.520
Mr. Ko

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:51.960
Did we take the wrong path?

01:15:52.399 --> 01:15:53.720
The eastern gate is there

01:15:56.399 --> 01:15:57.239
We won't go there

01:15:58.720 --> 01:15:59.720
where are we going?

01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:02.560
To the right

01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:09.720
Liu Shiqi failed

01:16:10.439 --> 01:16:12.119
Come back with us
to Yamin for trial

01:16:12.119 --> 01:16:13.479
There is no evidence

01:16:13.479 --> 01:16:14.640
On what basis are you taking me?

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:16.000
For any reason?

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:18.960
Incitement of trouble

01:16:19.479 --> 01:16:20.960
And resisting arrest

01:16:22.399 --> 01:16:22.920
You...

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:23.520
Go

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:24.479
Go

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:32.159
You are an emperor

01:16:33.199 --> 01:16:34.720
Are your dishes still salty?

01:16:50.079 --> 01:16:51.119
Think about it carefully

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:53.560
think about it

01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:57.279
What options are available to Lu Che now?

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.119
Who else is besides him?

01:17:07.439 --> 01:17:09.079
It doesn't matter

01:17:11.479 --> 01:17:12.720
You

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:17.119
No evidence

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:18.720
He's right

01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:21.760
Then release him

01:17:26.359 --> 01:17:27.439
Release him when it gets dark

01:17:29.199 --> 01:17:29.760
you go

01:17:31.079 --> 01:17:32.479
Be careful on your way home

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:34.960
She doesn't end up like Zhang Jie

01:17:36.199 --> 01:17:36.760
I am waiting

01:17:39.399 --> 01:17:43.000
How can I save my life?

01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:51.560
20 years ago

01:17:53.199 --> 01:17:54.560
Lu Che killed the Lu family

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:57.600
After 20 years

01:17:58.159 --> 01:18:00.600
He started killing
to avoid future problems

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:01.600
You are an accomplice in crime

01:18:02.159 --> 01:18:04.119
But you turned yourself in to testify

01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:05.680
You won't die

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:06.760
but

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.600
You will be in prison for years

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.319
Not possible

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:16.600
What's your idea?

01:18:21.199 --> 01:18:24.760
Nothing
about what happened 20 years ago

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:28.479
Lu Qi and I were servants
of the Lu family

01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:32.199
I saved him from the fire

01:18:32.199 --> 01:18:33.680
He owed me

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:35.439
We became close friends

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:37.079
A few days ago

01:18:37.079 --> 01:18:39.199
He almost lost his mind
and started killing people

01:18:39.199 --> 01:18:41.760
I don't know why

01:18:42.359 --> 01:18:45.319
I found out he was a murderer

01:18:45.319 --> 01:18:47.119
I convinced him to surrender

01:18:47.119 --> 01:18:49.760
But he booked me

01:18:50.119 --> 01:18:52.760
He tried to kill me several times

01:18:53.439 --> 01:18:56.920
But he couldn't do it
because I once saved his life

01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:58.760
I took the opportunity to escape

01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:00.119
When he left town

01:19:00.359 --> 01:19:02.119
This was reported to Yemen

01:19:11.359 --> 01:19:13.199
Your testimony does not stand up to scrutiny

01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:16.560
Lu Che will torture you

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:18.760
I know he will

01:19:19.479 --> 01:19:20.359
permission

01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:23.840
may be

01:19:26.039 --> 01:19:29.399
To bite you too

01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:42.720
Well it's over

01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:43.760
Something extra

01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:47.199
I can be the witness

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:51.239
But how do you protect me?

01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:53.239
Who silenced him?

01:19:53.239 --> 01:19:54.880
You will be safe
before the case is closed

01:19:57.159 --> 01:19:58.319
After closing

01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:03.319
I think you will definitely find a way

01:20:05.079 --> 01:20:06.000
To get away

01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:08.680
And

01:20:13.399 --> 01:20:14.359
Thats all about it?

01:20:16.399 --> 01:20:17.760
Would you believe anything else I say?

01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:28.520
Okay, I'll listen to you

01:20:36.319 --> 01:20:37.960
You will find out

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.399
What happened 20 years ago

01:20:52.399 --> 01:20:54.880
The sectarian letter
I was asked to write last night

01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:57.199
It was kitsch

01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:00.880
And based on that

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.399
You may not be able to defeat me

01:21:04.399 --> 01:21:05.760
If you go back on your words

01:21:07.079 --> 01:21:08.760
I can always find a way

01:21:10.079 --> 01:21:11.000
When it's over

01:21:13.359 --> 01:21:14.399
I will kill myself as I promised you

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:20.640
You planned to die with your enemy

01:21:21.399 --> 01:21:23.720
That's why we believe you half

01:21:24.399 --> 01:21:26.079
Revenge is not easy

01:21:28.079 --> 01:21:31.399
For both of us

01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:33.920
I'm not doing this for revenge

01:21:34.359 --> 01:21:35.399
Not for revenge?

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.880
Captain Leng has been avenged

01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:43.199
You're doing it for Mr. Song

01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:50.039
Mr. Song has no grudge with anyone

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:52.680
He just did his duty as a judge

01:21:56.399 --> 01:21:58.840
I am only doing my duty as an advisor

01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:02.720
Give Way

01:22:03.199 --> 01:22:05.039
Give Way

01:22:05.039 --> 01:22:05.680
Clear path

01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:20.239
Here is the arrest warrant

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:21.920
We are here to catch Xue Qi

01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:22.920
The others are unrelated

01:22:23.279 --> 01:22:24.239
Please step aside

01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:27.399
Or you will be seen as a
partner

01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:28.680
to retreat

01:22:35.199 --> 01:22:36.720
(Prosperity)
I am an imperial scholar

01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:38.479
This is not a memo
from local Yamin

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:40.760
He is from Nitai Yamin

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:44.479
Your title has already been cancelled

01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:57.760
You

01:22:58.600 --> 01:22:59.279
here

01:23:00.439 --> 01:23:01.239
I'm here

01:23:02.239 --> 01:23:03.399
It's been 20 years

01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:05.199
I have some questions for you

01:23:06.439 --> 01:23:07.079
Help yourself

01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:14.640
Mr. Bey

01:23:15.279 --> 01:23:17.000
How did you survive?

01:23:18.079 --> 01:23:20.760
Who was that heavenly corpse?

01:23:21.479 --> 01:23:23.680
Do you remember Xiao Bo
from Zhua Tower?

01:23:24.359 --> 01:23:26.800
That corpse was Xiao Bao?

01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:29.079
Was he at Lu's house at that time?

01:23:29.119 --> 01:23:29.920
at that time

01:23:32.359 --> 01:23:34.359
If only you knew Xiao Bo over there

01:23:36.239 --> 01:23:37.479
Would you have saved him?

01:23:38.319 --> 01:23:39.199
some thing

01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:42.039
Inescapable

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:45.359
I was sad for him

01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:49.159
I was burning his paper money

01:23:51.319 --> 01:23:52.479
permission

01:23:55.239 --> 01:23:57.119
I'm also sad for Lou

01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:01.119
I burned paper for him every year

01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:05.319
But

01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:11.279
At that time, Lu Che

01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:14.359
It wouldn't have saved him

01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:16.760
Lu Che had no other way

01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:17.760
I know

01:24:19.199 --> 01:24:20.720
I was originally called Xie

01:24:21.079 --> 01:24:22.800
I am not Lu Che

01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:34.239
I'm not a Loyo Boutique

01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:40.640
You...

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.600
Are you not a Leo?

01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:48.159
Do you still remember Xiao Bao?

01:24:49.159 --> 01:24:50.479
Xiao Bo

01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:54.680
Mr. Lu

01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:58.319
Xiao Bao

01:24:59.479 --> 01:25:00.199
Mr. Lu

01:25:08.199 --> 01:25:08.920
Mr. Lu

01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:14.960
Mr. Lu

01:25:16.159 --> 01:25:17.159
Mr. Lu

01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:19.640
Mr. Lu

01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:22.399
Are you Xiao Bao?

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:21.079
What interest?

01:26:21.079 --> 01:26:22.319
- It's already been burned
- Lu Che

01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:25.039
However

01:26:25.039 --> 01:26:26.159
I still need to see it

01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:28.000
He must die

01:27:22.119 --> 01:27:26.199
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight

01:27:26.279 --> 01:27:29.359
Nine, ten, 11, twelve

01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:33.720
Thirteen, fourteen

01:27:51.199 --> 01:27:52.079
I wouldn't dare start a fire

01:27:52.079 --> 01:27:53.199
I can't eat it

01:27:53.239 --> 01:27:54.319
But you ate it

01:28:48.482 --> 01:28:50.176
(after a year)

01:29:58.920 --> 01:29:59.720
Mr. Lu

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.159
I know what's going on

01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:04.920
I learned to read

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:09.439
Lu Zhong wrote

01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:11.720
Everything

01:30:13.399 --> 01:30:14.279
Guess what?

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.479
It wasn't a mutation

01:30:17.439 --> 01:30:18.279
Mr. Lu

01:30:19.199 --> 01:30:20.800
Lu Che did a lot of bad things

01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:23.000
And bad people help him

01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:24.359
Mr. Lu

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:26.680
in this world

01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:30.520
There are many good people like you

01:30:31.399 --> 01:30:33.079
But all I see are good people...

01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:36.560
Mr. Lu

01:30:38.039 --> 01:30:39.119
I took some gold

01:30:40.479 --> 01:30:42.399
Engraving
from Confucius Analykat

01:30:43.239 --> 01:30:44.319
Made of gold

01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:50.520
I saw a sentence in it

01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:53.239
Some people hurt others themselves

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.439
While some hurt themselves to others

01:30:56.880 --> 01:30:57.600
Mr. Lu

01:30:59.039 --> 01:31:00.399
You died to save me

01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:03.560
You hurt yourself for someone else

01:31:09.239 --> 01:31:10.760
Since I took your gold

01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:13.039
I can't take it for nothing

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:19.800
Mr. Lu

01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:21.880
I swear to you

01:31:23.079 --> 01:31:24.239
I will correct

01:31:26.479 --> 01:31:27.359
I can not

01:31:39.439 --> 01:31:40.199
permission

01:31:42.279 --> 01:31:43.159
What will you tell me?

01:31:43.199 --> 01:31:44.239
for me?

01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:47.199
You know that

01:31:48.319 --> 01:31:50.000
Just one phrase is most appropriate

01:31:53.119 --> 01:31:54.359
Who wins against the sky?

01:31:56.159 --> 01:31:57.359
It would be hopeless

01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:03.159
Whoever mediates against heaven

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.520
It would be hopeless

01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:12.840
It's ridiculous

01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:15.720
in my life

01:32:17.479 --> 01:32:19.079
I never asked heaven for anything

01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:20.920
but now

01:32:23.239 --> 01:32:25.279
Heaven wants to punish me

01:32:28.279 --> 01:32:29.920
this is the way

01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:33.600
The sky is unbelievable

01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:35.960
Yes in deed

01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:41.119
Oh

01:32:44.239 --> 01:32:45.640
I have another question

01:32:51.079 --> 01:32:53.239
How did you know about these things?

01:32:53.399 --> 01:32:56.199
How did you know about Mr. Wang?

01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:57.439
Dr. Cheng

01:32:58.439 --> 01:32:59.640
And Mr. Chow?

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.560
You don't want to say that

01:33:07.199 --> 01:33:08.439
In front of them?

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:10.880
It seems

01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:15.640
Heaven doesn't just punish me

01:33:18.319 --> 01:33:19.439
It also makes me die

01:33:21.079 --> 01:33:22.239
Without knowing the truth

01:33:24.239 --> 01:33:25.079
Good

01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:31.520
I'll tell you that

01:33:41.479 --> 01:33:43.960
Understood

01:33:46.119 --> 01:33:47.479
As you know

01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:49.079
She was born with a bad fate

01:33:49.319 --> 01:33:51.600
I just want to change my destiny

01:33:53.279 --> 01:33:53.920
Judge Wei

01:33:55.399 --> 01:33:56.520
Receive a doctor

01:34:05.079 --> 01:34:05.720
Judge Wei

01:34:08.119 --> 01:34:09.279
Have you tasted?

01:34:11.199 --> 01:34:12.840
Crispy pastries?

01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:16.399
It's really

01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:19.960
Tasty

01:35:15.971 --> 01:35:17.709
(Make food superior)

01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:43.479
Sorry

01:35:55.279 --> 01:35:57.359
When I was cleaning Mr. Song's things

01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:00.680
I found this

01:36:01.399 --> 01:36:04.039
Written on it: "For the sake of glory"

01:36:04.359 --> 01:36:05.560
I asked everywhere

01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:08.439
I probably found it for you

01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:12.760
Mr. Song?

01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:23.439
Early flower fairy

01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:28.600
It's a poem?

01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:38.640
(In a far away land,)

01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:42.640
(There is a fairy for the flower)

01:36:44.079 --> 01:36:46.239
(fun tree fantasy plants)

01:36:47.199 --> 01:36:50.239
(with falling peat)

01:36:51.479 --> 01:36:53.800
(The fairy starts dancing gently)

01:36:54.399 --> 01:36:57.520
(Low flowers are the reward)

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.600
(smoke and singing)

01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:05.640
(She lives in peace)

01:37:07.479 --> 01:37:09.760
"Some people don't like flowers"

01:37:11.119 --> 01:37:14.039
"The wind blows the flowers away."

01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:17.840
(Precious flowers are in favor)
)

01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:22.199
(At a time when you suffer the world's contempt)

01:37:24.159 --> 01:37:26.479
(If you compare the two)

01:37:27.439 --> 01:37:30.079
(People will think I'm crazy)

01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:33.960
(compared to these people)

01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:37.760
(I'd rather be crazy)

01:37:41.439 --> 01:37:43.880
(I am wary of trap flowers)

01:37:45.159 --> 01:37:46.600
(A link will be formed)

01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:49.640
(millions of years later)

01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:53.439
(I often sit under the flowers)

01:37:55.199 --> 01:37:56.479
(Even if I die, I will sleep)

01:37:57.640 --> 01:37:58.640
(under the flowers)

01:38:53.764 --> 01:38:55.380
