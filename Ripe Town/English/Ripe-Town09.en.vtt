00:36.520 --> 00:37.200
Please have a seat.

00:37.640 --> 00:38.359
Sir.

00:40.320 --> 00:40.759
Okay.

00:52.520 --> 00:53.119
Sir,

00:54.159 --> 00:55.359
what can I do for you?

00:59.399 --> 01:01.880
Please give this to Ms. Lin
and tell her that I am here for her.

02:01.184 --> 02:05.105

=Episode 9=

02:11.840 --> 02:13.400
The beard is different.

02:14.280 --> 02:16.000
It can't be painted
like how you do your eyebrows.

02:19.159 --> 02:22.400
I actually don't know
how to do my eyebrows well.

02:51.240 --> 02:52.560
You really look like your father.

02:53.680 --> 02:55.520
I saw your brother on the street.

02:56.560 --> 02:58.000
He looks more like your mother.

02:59.639 --> 03:00.719
You are more like your father.

03:06.439 --> 03:08.319
I knew you had an affair with my father.

03:09.319 --> 03:12.159
My mother knew it too.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.080
Do you resent me?

03:23.360 --> 03:24.240
Maybe when I was a child.

03:26.199 --> 03:27.560
But now if you ask me,

03:29.439 --> 03:31.680
I can't say what you did wrong.

03:36.159 --> 03:37.960
I don't know many things
about my father,

03:38.319 --> 03:39.520
but I think you should know.

03:39.960 --> 03:41.520
I wanted to ask you a long time ago.

03:43.960 --> 03:45.000
What do you want to ask?

03:46.360 --> 03:47.680
I will tell you what I know.

03:52.400 --> 03:55.719
Did my father only come to see you
every time he came here?

03:59.159 --> 03:59.719
Yes.

04:01.199 --> 04:03.960
He only visited me every time.

04:05.400 --> 04:07.159
He had never looked for anyone else.

04:07.919 --> 04:09.680
Don't men love juggling different women?

04:10.080 --> 04:12.159
Your father didn't.

04:15.840 --> 04:18.959
Are you here
to ask me about your father?

04:22.160 --> 04:23.000
Not really.

04:23.800 --> 04:26.600
But tell me about him first.

04:37.360 --> 04:41.680
My parents died during a plague.

04:42.800 --> 04:46.680
I was sold to Cuihua Tower
by my uncle when I was 11.

04:47.879 --> 04:49.720
I started learning painting
and calligraphy,

04:51.079 --> 04:52.480
playing music, and singing songs

04:53.839 --> 04:54.879
till 14.

04:58.240 --> 05:01.399
My menstruation came late,
giving me another year of an easy life.

05:02.319 --> 05:04.120
But when I was 15,

05:04.720 --> 05:05.759
the day finally came.

05:06.399 --> 05:07.319
I had to entertain guests.

05:10.639 --> 05:12.160
I found an opportunity

05:15.639 --> 05:16.560
to escape.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.800
You ran from Cuihua Tower?

05:22.040 --> 05:23.120
Where did you run?

05:27.360 --> 05:28.759
I had nowhere to go.

05:30.839 --> 05:32.319
I didn't know the way.

05:33.439 --> 05:35.120
I didn't have any money.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.279
But weren't you afraid
of running into bad guys?

05:37.319 --> 05:38.800
Before thinking of that,

05:40.319 --> 05:41.319
I encountered one.

05:42.439 --> 05:46.000
Girl, stop. I'm not a bad guy.

05:47.879 --> 05:49.399
I told you to stop.

05:49.560 --> 05:51.959
Let me take good care of you.

05:56.000 --> 05:56.639
Let go!

06:00.560 --> 06:01.160
Get lost.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.399
Don't be afraid. I'm an official.

06:37.040 --> 06:39.360
Where do you live?
I can take you home.

06:48.040 --> 06:49.040
Stop following me.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.040
I am a bailiff from the Yamen.

06:52.720 --> 06:53.920
Tell me where your home is.

06:54.480 --> 06:55.319
I will take you home.

06:56.399 --> 06:57.279
Mind your own business.

06:57.759 --> 06:59.040
I didn't break the law.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.079
You're a young girl,

07:01.079 --> 07:03.079
walking alone
in the middle of the night,

07:03.480 --> 07:04.560
and you can't tell where to go.

07:05.199 --> 07:05.879
Honestly,

07:06.399 --> 07:08.040
I can take you to the Yamen.

07:10.160 --> 07:11.079
If you don't tell me,

07:11.560 --> 07:12.720
I will do that.

07:30.759 --> 07:33.199
I have nowhere to go.

07:34.399 --> 07:35.160
What?

07:37.160 --> 07:38.319
How can you have nowhere to go?

07:40.120 --> 07:41.600
I ran away from a place.

07:42.720 --> 07:43.720
What?

07:46.160 --> 07:47.360
From where?

08:13.079 --> 08:14.040
Are you

08:14.879 --> 08:16.079
a maid from a wealthy family,

08:16.759 --> 08:18.040
or a girl from a brothel?

08:19.079 --> 08:20.199
Cuihua Tower.

08:25.319 --> 08:26.959
If you want to go back there,

08:26.959 --> 08:28.079
I can take you back.

08:28.199 --> 08:30.040
Please don't take me back.

08:32.360 --> 08:34.159
If they know I escaped,

08:34.320 --> 08:36.840
they will kill me.

08:42.919 --> 08:44.200
I can help you.

08:45.440 --> 08:46.919
I will make up a story to cover for you.

08:47.559 --> 08:50.399
When you were kidnapped by a villain,

08:50.720 --> 08:51.840
I happened to see you.

08:51.840 --> 08:53.440
I drove away the villain and saved you.

08:54.080 --> 08:56.399
I'm a bailiff, and they will believe me.

08:58.639 --> 08:59.960
Don't take me back.

09:01.679 --> 09:03.039
Please don't.

09:05.799 --> 09:07.440
If you really don't want to go back...

09:29.919 --> 09:30.679
Are you hungry?

09:33.279 --> 09:34.519
I'll go buy you some food.

09:35.000 --> 09:35.919
Wait here for me.

09:52.519 --> 09:55.399
I just gave you all my money.

10:04.840 --> 10:05.639
Hold this lantern.

11:14.080 --> 11:14.600
Here.

11:29.120 --> 11:31.799
I also bought you rice milk.

11:44.799 --> 11:45.759
Are you full?

11:48.519 --> 11:50.600
If I finish this bun,

11:51.279 --> 11:53.080
you will take me back to Cuihua Tower?

11:55.399 --> 11:56.879
If you want to go back,

11:58.320 --> 11:59.440
I will take you back.

11:59.960 --> 12:01.879
If you don't want to,

12:02.759 --> 12:04.320
I will pretend I never saw you.

12:07.559 --> 12:09.960
What if I can't make up my mind?

12:12.440 --> 12:14.720
I will wait for you to decide.

12:49.759 --> 12:50.679
I am full.

12:52.039 --> 12:53.679
Take me back to Cuihua Tower.

13:02.440 --> 13:03.559
What happened after that?

13:06.879 --> 13:09.679
I came back
and started to entertain clients.

13:11.039 --> 13:12.320
I became popular very soon.

13:13.720 --> 13:14.799
Well,

13:16.720 --> 13:17.879
half a year later,

13:19.360 --> 13:20.639
your father came.

13:22.639 --> 13:26.240
This is not even enough
to pay Siniang for a chat.

13:27.679 --> 13:29.240
Sir.

13:29.759 --> 13:31.679
Why don't you switch to someone else?

13:32.039 --> 13:33.000
I don't want anyone else.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.559
How much does it cost

13:36.480 --> 13:37.159
to chat with her?

13:37.639 --> 13:38.639
20 taels of silver.

13:45.879 --> 13:46.720
Wait a minute.

13:53.519 --> 13:55.799
Ms. Zhao, don't you remember him?

13:57.639 --> 13:58.440
He is...

13:59.320 --> 14:01.480
He is the bailiff who saved me.

14:03.759 --> 14:04.960
He didn't wear an official uniform.

14:05.360 --> 14:06.679
I didn't recognize him.

14:06.879 --> 14:08.159
Let me spend some time with him.

14:08.279 --> 14:09.559
I'll talk with him.

14:09.559 --> 14:10.919
It can be a way to repay his kindness.

14:11.279 --> 14:12.919
I know you love money so much.

14:12.919 --> 14:14.840
But if other officials know

14:15.080 --> 14:16.559
you are so ungrateful and send away

14:17.200 --> 14:18.279
the savior of my life,

14:18.960 --> 14:20.360
none of them will be willing to help you

14:20.480 --> 14:22.240
when you need them.

14:28.039 --> 14:29.440
Sir.

14:29.639 --> 14:31.879
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.720
You will forgive me, right?

14:34.440 --> 14:35.159
It's alright.

14:35.320 --> 14:37.960
Even though I'm a businesswoman,

14:38.279 --> 14:40.159
I'm grateful.

14:40.279 --> 14:41.399
Are you?

14:41.799 --> 14:42.919
Of course.

14:43.320 --> 14:45.919
That's important to us.

14:46.960 --> 14:48.519
The scholar, Mr. Wang

14:48.840 --> 14:50.279
is a regular here.

14:50.679 --> 14:51.879
He once said

14:52.200 --> 14:53.600
there must be women

14:54.159 --> 14:55.759
of sentiment in a pleasure house.

15:05.080 --> 15:06.000
The tea is already cold.

15:06.799 --> 15:08.240
I'll have someone get you some hot tea.

15:09.679 --> 15:10.519
No, thanks.

15:12.200 --> 15:13.039
I'm leaving now.

15:13.039 --> 15:13.879
Now?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.360
Why did you come here?

15:19.120 --> 15:20.279
Just to see you.

15:22.639 --> 15:23.440
To see me?

15:24.679 --> 15:26.480
It costs money to see me.

15:27.919 --> 15:29.720
Don't spend your money on me anymore.

15:31.639 --> 15:32.879
I'm not worth it.

15:35.720 --> 15:37.159
I've saved for eight months,

15:39.320 --> 15:41.159
getting around six taels of silver.

15:42.440 --> 15:43.720
To have tea with you,

15:44.559 --> 15:45.720
it costs 20 taels.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.039
In this case,

15:48.440 --> 15:49.279
I can see you once

15:51.440 --> 15:52.799
every two years.

15:56.639 --> 15:58.120
What's the point?

15:59.679 --> 16:01.399
It doesn't matter.

16:05.240 --> 16:06.120
However,

16:10.759 --> 16:12.159
the thought

16:13.840 --> 16:15.320
of never seeing you again

16:16.519 --> 16:17.879
is killing me.

16:36.240 --> 16:37.039
Yanzhi Alley.

16:38.919 --> 16:41.559
The back door of Cuihua Tower is
on Yanzhi Alley.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.639
Wait for me there three days later

16:45.360 --> 16:46.600
at six in the evening.

16:48.279 --> 16:49.320
I'll go to see you.

17:55.319 --> 17:59.680
So you were in a relationship
before my father married my mother.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.480
You are from Cuihua Tower,

18:03.079 --> 18:04.559
so you two cannot be together.

18:05.279 --> 18:08.759
Actually, your father once redeemed me.

18:09.079 --> 18:10.599
To redeem me,

18:12.079 --> 18:13.160
your father did a lot of things

18:15.599 --> 18:16.720
he shouldn't have done.

18:17.720 --> 18:19.599
After he really redeemed me,

18:20.240 --> 18:21.240
I realized

18:21.920 --> 18:22.960
my body could never be redeemed

18:23.960 --> 18:26.160
ever since he brought me back

18:28.000 --> 18:29.440
to Cuihua Tower.

18:32.119 --> 18:33.039
Why?

18:34.160 --> 18:36.000
I'm 38 this year.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.880
One in ten prostitutes

18:39.079 --> 18:40.160
can live

18:41.359 --> 18:42.640
this long.

18:43.359 --> 18:44.039
Really?

18:45.160 --> 18:47.440
Most of us could be killed

18:47.680 --> 18:49.000
by being pregnant.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.680
They won't let us give birth
once we are pregnant.

18:53.640 --> 18:54.839
The abortion method is deadly.

18:55.440 --> 18:56.599
It involves medicines

18:56.799 --> 18:59.079
like cinnabar, cantharides,

18:59.279 --> 19:01.000
and a little dose of arsenic.

19:01.680 --> 19:03.480
It could kill two lives together.

19:03.839 --> 19:05.640
And some survived and gave birth.

19:05.640 --> 19:07.319
But life for them is bitter.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.559
Their kids are called turtles.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.240
Ms. Lin.

19:12.680 --> 19:13.960
Have you ever

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
been pregnant before?

19:20.319 --> 19:21.920
I've never been pregnant.

19:24.799 --> 19:26.880
If I can't bear children,

19:29.960 --> 19:31.680
how can I marry your father?

19:34.319 --> 19:36.160
Fortunately, your father
married your mother.

19:38.359 --> 19:38.960
Look.

19:40.759 --> 19:41.640
He's lucky.

19:43.359 --> 19:45.640
He has a daughter so much like him.

19:52.440 --> 19:54.720
How did you know the money was from me?

19:56.599 --> 19:59.319
Your money is scented.

19:59.880 --> 20:01.599
You didn't come
to return it to me, did you?

20:02.319 --> 20:04.640
I wanted to ask
about my dad and Mr. Xue.

20:06.759 --> 20:09.839
Or should I ask about my dad and Lu Zhi?

20:12.359 --> 20:13.119
Sui Laosan.

20:14.960 --> 20:15.839
Sui Laosan.

20:17.319 --> 20:18.240
Sui Laosan.

20:20.279 --> 20:21.039
Coming.

20:28.759 --> 20:30.200
Ms. Lin, what can I do for you?

20:32.039 --> 20:35.200
Bring the new brocade to...

20:36.839 --> 20:37.880
To this gentleman.

20:38.359 --> 20:40.839
The one with azure color, densely woven
with gold and silver thread.

20:40.839 --> 20:41.720
Got it.

20:43.880 --> 20:44.839
Leave the door open.

20:45.759 --> 20:46.880
I want to get some air.

20:48.341 --> 20:49.059
Alright.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.400
Bring Sangeng over.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.079
I'll tell him everything I know.

21:02.759 --> 21:03.440
Gui's.

21:04.640 --> 21:06.519
You must not get involved.

21:07.799 --> 21:09.319
You must not have any connection

21:10.039 --> 21:11.440
with Mr. Xue.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.000
This must be it.

21:15.480 --> 21:17.400
It's the only new tomb here.

21:50.559 --> 21:51.279
Ms. Lin.

21:52.519 --> 21:53.960
When you meet my father down there,

21:55.039 --> 21:56.160
have a good life with him.

21:57.640 --> 21:58.880
Don't part ways again.

22:00.039 --> 22:01.640
Gui's.

22:01.640 --> 22:02.680
It's okay.

22:03.519 --> 22:06.440
She's suffered too much.

22:08.559 --> 22:10.640
I wanted to get a tombstone for her.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.519
But on the tombstone,

22:13.319 --> 22:15.440
there's a title in front of the name,

22:16.119 --> 22:20.279
like mother, sister, or wife.

22:20.680 --> 22:21.640
But...

22:24.720 --> 22:26.559
I don't know what to inscribe for her.

22:32.759 --> 22:33.799
My mother suffered as well,

22:34.880 --> 22:36.240
but not as much as she did.

22:38.160 --> 22:39.519
My mother has me and my brother,

22:40.680 --> 22:42.359
but she only has a lonely tomb

22:43.960 --> 22:45.279
without even a stone.

23:25.720 --> 23:28.960
Did the killer leave a note
for Ms. Lin as well?

23:32.039 --> 23:34.519
In his youth
his vital force is unstable.

23:36.359 --> 23:37.480
He should guard against lust.

23:38.079 --> 23:39.240
It is easy.

23:39.519 --> 23:40.720
Even I could understand it.

23:44.039 --> 23:45.160
What did you say?

23:45.799 --> 23:47.359
Even I could understand it.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.599
What do you think that phrase means?

23:51.480 --> 23:54.160
Youths are prone to impulsiveness.

23:54.519 --> 23:56.599
So be careful of lust for women.

23:58.920 --> 23:59.720
No.

24:01.920 --> 24:02.880
I'm not right?

24:04.519 --> 24:05.200
Yes,

24:05.960 --> 24:07.039
you are right.

24:09.119 --> 24:10.200
The problem lies elsewhere.

24:34.250 --> 24:46.080
(Worship the wrong ghost.)

24:49.519 --> 24:51.480
The victim is Zhao Youren,
an Imperial Scholar.

24:52.359 --> 24:54.079
He originally came
from a respected family.

24:54.240 --> 24:55.880
But his family collapsed.

24:56.559 --> 24:57.799
He liked to raise pigeons.

24:59.160 --> 25:00.599
He had his throat cut.

25:03.160 --> 25:04.200
Again?

25:07.240 --> 25:10.000
The message was written in rouge.
It reads, "Worship the wrong ghost."

25:14.440 --> 25:15.480
You worshiped

25:18.000 --> 25:19.839
the wrong ghost.

25:20.759 --> 25:23.559
I think this killer is using the body
to send us messages.

25:26.279 --> 25:28.440
The message left
for Lin Siniang is too blunt.

25:28.920 --> 25:30.519
But the previous ones

25:31.039 --> 25:33.279
(He should guard against lust.)
carry a hidden meaning.

25:38.799 --> 25:40.720
And this victim has the same cause

25:40.720 --> 25:42.359
and state of death as Lin Siniang.

25:42.960 --> 25:44.519
He was deliberately dressed up
as a woman.

25:45.160 --> 25:47.279
And the message.
"Worship the wrong ghost."

25:47.519 --> 25:49.880
You worshiped the wrong ghost.

25:51.319 --> 25:54.119
- You mean...
- The killer wants to tell us

25:56.440 --> 25:57.960
that he didn't kill Lin Siniang.

26:01.839 --> 26:05.559
(1589 AD)
(Lu Yuanbao's condition was not stable.)

26:06.359 --> 26:07.880
(It never got better.)

26:09.160 --> 26:11.079
(He began to have nightmares,)

26:11.799 --> 26:13.759
(dreaming about the deceased.)

26:20.039 --> 26:20.799
Guards!

26:35.559 --> 26:36.200
Lu Zhong.

26:37.920 --> 26:39.880
I dreamt of Tao Laowu.

26:41.680 --> 26:43.240
(I remember him.)

26:46.920 --> 26:48.839
Go kill him.

26:51.720 --> 26:52.440
Kill him.

26:54.640 --> 26:57.200
(He was killed 13 years ago.)

26:58.279 --> 26:59.240
It's good.

27:00.359 --> 27:00.880
Well,

27:04.160 --> 27:05.039
was he really killed?

27:08.240 --> 27:09.960
Go back to sleep.

27:17.440 --> 27:18.559
(You stay here.)

27:22.839 --> 27:25.519
(Watch him. I'm leaving.)

28:31.119 --> 28:32.000
Tian Shun Xiang.

28:34.200 --> 28:34.920
Accounts settled.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.519
Mr. Li, thank you.

28:42.640 --> 28:43.640
Not at all, Master Lu.

28:47.839 --> 28:48.640
Fuxing Shop.

28:56.599 --> 28:58.079
Master Lu, are you done?

28:59.039 --> 28:59.599
Almost.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.200
When you're done, go and visit Mr. Lu.

29:03.200 --> 29:03.880
In the back garden.

29:05.440 --> 29:06.680
Isn't he in the study?

29:06.880 --> 29:10.119
Mr. Lu is in good spirits today
and wants to have a drink.

29:15.039 --> 29:15.759
mr. Sun.

29:24.400 --> 29:25.759
You've worked hard these days.

29:28.359 --> 29:29.160
I'm doing my job.

29:30.400 --> 29:32.640
Mr. Lu, this is the account book
from last month.

29:32.640 --> 29:33.559
No rush.

29:34.279 --> 29:35.839
Sit, and have a drink with me.

29:38.160 --> 29:41.039
Mr. Lu, Dr. Cheng does not permit you
to drink alcohol.

29:41.039 --> 29:44.640
The doctor only wishes everyone
to take medicine.

29:45.000 --> 29:45.880
Just ignore him.

29:47.920 --> 29:48.559
Bottoms up.

29:55.039 --> 29:57.680
This is the old grain wine,

29:58.559 --> 30:00.960
just shipped over via the Yangtze River.

30:01.880 --> 30:02.839
How's the taste?

30:04.759 --> 30:07.039
Your wine is naturally good.

30:08.160 --> 30:09.000
Sweet boy.

30:10.240 --> 30:11.160
Lu Zhi.

30:11.920 --> 30:13.240
How much can you drink?

30:13.799 --> 30:15.119
I can't drink much.

30:15.400 --> 30:17.119
Just drink as much as you like.

30:17.400 --> 30:19.440
I will test your drinking capacity.

30:20.160 --> 30:21.480
If you say so,

30:22.960 --> 30:24.200
I will

30:24.640 --> 30:25.920
get drunk here.

30:30.640 --> 30:32.480
Drinking like this is boring.

30:33.839 --> 30:35.440
We need to play a drinking game.

30:35.799 --> 30:39.359
Let me guess the account
you just settled today.

30:39.799 --> 30:41.400
Can you do it?

30:41.920 --> 30:43.160
Within five taels of difference,

30:43.519 --> 30:44.920
I win.

30:45.440 --> 30:46.319
And you will drink.

30:46.640 --> 30:48.759
If I guess wrong, I'll drink.

30:49.720 --> 30:50.400
mr. Sun.

30:52.160 --> 30:55.119
Is this your excuse to drink more?

30:55.559 --> 30:56.400
Do you dare?

30:56.759 --> 30:57.720
Why not?

30:58.720 --> 31:00.680
You're as outright as me.

31:01.559 --> 31:03.400
Someone, bring a larger bowl.

31:08.599 --> 31:09.960
Let's start.

31:12.880 --> 31:13.519
Alright.

31:21.240 --> 31:22.119
Hey Shop.

31:27.680 --> 31:28.960
Two thousand...

31:30.920 --> 31:37.279
2,950 taels in total.

31:39.720 --> 31:40.480
How is it?

31:41.000 --> 31:41.920
Guessed right.

31:42.000 --> 31:42.960
Drink up.

31:58.400 --> 31:59.000
Alright.

32:00.000 --> 32:00.759
Again.

32:06.920 --> 32:08.079
Long Chang Sheng.

32:13.799 --> 32:17.920
5,292 taels.

32:18.759 --> 32:19.920
You guessed right.

32:21.799 --> 32:23.519
I'm lucky.

32:23.759 --> 32:25.160
Drink.

32:35.039 --> 32:35.799
Again.

32:38.079 --> 32:38.799
Well...

32:39.519 --> 32:41.039
Wait a moment.

32:41.400 --> 32:43.519
I will choose one shop.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.279
And you make a guess.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.079
Alright, as you say.

33:00.400 --> 33:02.400
This is too easy for you.

33:03.640 --> 33:04.279
No.

33:07.799 --> 33:08.680
This one...

33:10.160 --> 33:10.960
This...

33:12.160 --> 33:13.000
Lu Zhi.

33:13.680 --> 33:15.599
I can tell

33:15.799 --> 33:17.799
you're playing for time.

33:21.759 --> 33:23.799
How did you know that?

33:24.440 --> 33:26.960
Lion Restaurant.

33:29.799 --> 33:30.799
Lion Restaurant?

33:33.279 --> 33:34.960
Lion Restaurant?

33:38.279 --> 33:39.599
You got me.

33:41.680 --> 33:43.480
Lion Restaurant?

33:50.799 --> 33:52.240
744 taels.

33:55.599 --> 33:56.519
You guessed it right.

33:56.759 --> 33:57.440
Drink.

33:58.000 --> 33:58.680
Okay.

34:07.240 --> 34:09.000
You keep drinking.

34:09.239 --> 34:10.400
It's too boring.

34:10.519 --> 34:11.920
I'll join you for a drink.

34:14.119 --> 34:16.199
How on earth did you guess it?

34:17.559 --> 34:20.280
I can guess.

34:20.960 --> 34:22.000
You can guess.

34:24.800 --> 34:25.559
Lu Zhi.

34:26.800 --> 34:27.800
Are you drunk?

34:30.920 --> 34:31.599
mr. Sun.

34:34.519 --> 34:35.480
Did you

34:36.280 --> 34:40.280
settle the accounts
with the bookkeepers in advance?

34:42.199 --> 34:42.800
No.

34:43.760 --> 34:46.440
You haven't been out for over a month.

34:47.159 --> 34:50.599
And those bookkeepers have never come.

34:51.480 --> 34:52.960
How did you know?

34:53.800 --> 34:54.679
Lu Zhi.

34:55.280 --> 34:56.960
Remember one thing.

34:57.559 --> 35:00.960
There is nothing, big or small,

35:01.800 --> 35:04.280
in my house that I don't know.

35:13.639 --> 35:16.199
Mr. Lu, I got it.

35:17.280 --> 35:20.400
After they settled accounts

35:20.400 --> 35:21.679
with me,

35:21.920 --> 35:23.199
they went

35:23.199 --> 35:25.000
to tell you one by one.

35:25.559 --> 35:29.280
You put these accounts in your sleeve.

35:30.440 --> 35:32.519
I saw it just now.
When you were walking,

35:32.519 --> 35:35.079
you turned your head and looked inside.

35:35.079 --> 35:36.320
I saw it.

35:37.000 --> 35:37.960
You're cheating.

35:39.039 --> 35:40.800
You have to drink.

35:40.960 --> 35:41.800
Lu Zhi.

35:42.800 --> 35:44.719
You are really drunk.

35:46.039 --> 35:46.960
I'm not drunk.

35:47.440 --> 35:50.239
I haven't finished my drink yet.

36:00.639 --> 36:03.199
But why did you make a fool of me?

36:05.000 --> 36:07.119
Are you trying to get me drunk?

36:09.079 --> 36:10.000
No.

36:10.519 --> 36:12.519
Even if you didn't do this,

36:12.679 --> 36:14.440
I would still drink a lot.

36:17.559 --> 36:18.400
I understand.

36:21.440 --> 36:22.280
I see.

36:23.360 --> 36:27.119
Mr. Lu, you are trying
to seem mysterious

36:28.400 --> 36:30.719
and well-informed.

36:31.119 --> 36:32.199
You know everything.

36:33.440 --> 36:34.960
You are trying to warn me.

36:37.800 --> 36:41.599
So, you don't trust me.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
You are trying to scare me.

36:45.679 --> 36:48.239
So I dare not mess around.

36:57.199 --> 36:59.800
Don't you know me?

37:00.400 --> 37:02.239
You don't have to do this.

37:04.079 --> 37:04.960
Well,

37:08.480 --> 37:11.280
I have always respected you
as my father.

37:13.400 --> 37:14.719
What did you say?

37:17.440 --> 37:18.199
mr. Sun.

37:20.679 --> 37:22.639
Without you,

37:23.280 --> 37:25.119
I, a beggar,

37:25.119 --> 37:27.559
would have died on the streets long ago.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.280
Although you don't have a son.

37:31.559 --> 37:32.800
I can be your son.

37:34.800 --> 37:38.519
I will certainly respect you
more than anyone.

37:39.280 --> 37:41.960
I will take care of you
during your later life.

37:42.159 --> 37:43.719
I will mourn for you.

37:44.639 --> 37:45.280
mr. Sun.

37:48.440 --> 37:51.440
I have always wanted to call you father.

38:01.679 --> 38:02.280
mr. Sun.

38:04.760 --> 38:05.440
Lu Zhi.

38:05.840 --> 38:08.679
They all call you Master Lu.

38:09.280 --> 38:11.000
Why?

38:14.639 --> 38:17.760
They keep calling me that.

38:17.960 --> 38:20.599
They have seen how well you treat me.

38:21.079 --> 38:23.000
I tried to stop them.

38:23.159 --> 38:24.719
I told them to stop calling me that,

38:24.800 --> 38:26.519
but they didn't listen to me...

38:26.519 --> 38:27.800
You lowly beast.

38:28.159 --> 38:29.519
Do you want a father?

38:30.400 --> 38:32.039
I'll give you one.

38:34.920 --> 38:37.480
You know this lowly servant
on his knees.

38:37.559 --> 38:39.119
My attendant, Lu Zhi.

38:39.800 --> 38:41.440
Somehow,

38:41.679 --> 38:42.760
he was possessed,

38:43.079 --> 38:44.920
telling everyone

38:45.159 --> 38:46.960
that I wanted to take him
as my adopted son.

38:47.400 --> 38:50.519
He even let everyone call him Master Lu.

38:50.920 --> 38:52.599
What are you?

38:54.280 --> 38:56.400
A lowly servant.

38:56.679 --> 38:59.280
How dare you.

39:01.519 --> 39:04.719
I just kept you as a dog,

39:05.079 --> 39:07.280
but you took yourself for a man.

39:08.280 --> 39:12.280
He said he would take care of me
in my old age.

39:13.400 --> 39:14.400
I know your trick.

39:14.639 --> 39:18.519
You think that since I have no children,

39:19.280 --> 39:22.639
all my property will belong to you.

39:24.559 --> 39:25.960
You want a father, right?

39:25.960 --> 39:29.079
All the men of the Lu family are here.

39:29.280 --> 39:31.440
Later, kowtow

39:31.719 --> 39:32.840
and ask each man

39:33.239 --> 39:34.480
who wants to be your father.

39:35.239 --> 39:36.320
If his surname is Zhang,

39:36.880 --> 39:38.280
your name will be Zhang Zhi.

39:39.159 --> 39:40.159
If his surname is Li,

39:41.079 --> 39:42.199
your name will be Li Zhi.

39:43.239 --> 39:44.079
Do it now.

39:49.880 --> 39:50.719
Help him.

40:05.280 --> 40:06.039
Speak.

40:09.400 --> 40:10.039
Slap him.

40:20.199 --> 40:21.000
Go on.

40:21.760 --> 40:23.239
Hit him until he speaks.

40:35.280 --> 40:36.480
mr. Sun.

40:38.400 --> 40:39.280
I'll speak for him.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.199
What a surprise.

40:43.599 --> 40:45.400
I can't believe you'll help him with it.

40:46.079 --> 40:48.559
Chen Wang, you are quite righteous.

40:49.119 --> 40:51.679
But I admire righteous people.

40:53.760 --> 40:56.519
Then you two find a father together.

40:58.760 --> 40:59.400
Okay.

41:09.039 --> 41:09.840
Well...

41:11.000 --> 41:11.960
Kowtow.

41:12.440 --> 41:12.960
Okay.

41:19.960 --> 41:22.519
Miao, are you willing...

41:22.840 --> 41:23.760
Louder.

41:24.159 --> 41:26.880
Miao, are you willing to be a father

41:26.880 --> 41:28.719
to me and Lu Zhi?

41:30.079 --> 41:32.000
Miao, did you hear?

41:33.079 --> 41:35.920
Yes, I did.

41:36.559 --> 41:37.760
So what do you say?

41:38.440 --> 41:39.280
I...

41:40.639 --> 41:41.440
I am unwilling.

41:45.360 --> 41:47.840
Miao, you lost your chance.

41:48.239 --> 41:49.039
Step aside.

42:04.800 --> 42:06.519
Are you willing to be our father?

42:07.239 --> 42:08.079
No.

42:14.239 --> 42:15.039
Chen Wang.

42:18.920 --> 42:19.840
I'll do it myself.

42:38.199 --> 42:40.760
Are you willing to be my father?

42:41.079 --> 42:41.719
No.

43:05.760 --> 43:08.159
Are you willing to be my father?

43:11.480 --> 43:12.159
No.

43:19.119 --> 43:21.599
(In the end,
Lu Zhi didn't get a father.)

43:23.719 --> 43:25.159
(Later, )

43:25.920 --> 43:28.119
(Lu Yuanbao sent him to a rural area)

43:28.760 --> 43:30.400
(to do farm work.)

43:41.559 --> 43:42.280
Lu Zhi.

43:44.360 --> 43:45.159
Lu Zhi.

43:51.039 --> 43:52.199
Where are the others?

43:52.920 --> 43:56.400
(You asked them to wait outside.)

43:58.880 --> 44:00.960
I was absorbed in writing and forgot.

44:02.519 --> 44:05.159
(I heard you.)

44:05.800 --> 44:08.320
(You didn't call them.)

44:10.719 --> 44:11.440
Lu Zhong.

44:13.159 --> 44:15.079
According to the rules,

44:16.320 --> 44:17.280
we should...

44:18.639 --> 44:19.360
(Kill him.)

44:20.920 --> 44:21.679
(I'll do it.)

44:25.159 --> 44:26.480
I've thought about it these days.

44:26.800 --> 44:27.679
Well,

44:28.880 --> 44:30.960
I overreacted.

44:31.320 --> 44:32.679
After that day,

44:32.920 --> 44:35.000
this kid must have hated me.

44:35.440 --> 44:36.480
I can't use him anymore.

44:38.559 --> 44:40.039
It's quite a pity.

44:46.480 --> 44:49.840
(Keeping him is dangerous.)

44:50.000 --> 44:50.760
(I'm afraid...)

44:52.599 --> 44:53.719
You're afraid of him?

44:56.960 --> 44:59.480
He's just a servant.

44:59.920 --> 45:02.239
He can't be compared to the others.

45:02.599 --> 45:05.519
Those were ruthless bandits.

45:05.519 --> 45:06.800
He's just an attendant.

45:07.360 --> 45:09.920
I just pampered him too much.

45:10.000 --> 45:13.199
So he dared to be presumptuous
in front of me.

45:13.719 --> 45:14.800
I have to make him afraid.

45:15.239 --> 45:16.119
When I call him,

45:16.880 --> 45:17.920
he will shiver.

45:18.000 --> 45:18.840
When I glare,

45:19.039 --> 45:20.880
he will wet his pants.

45:22.400 --> 45:23.400
It's fun.

45:25.559 --> 45:26.719
Call him back in a few days.

45:27.159 --> 45:28.440
He can't be my attendant.

45:28.960 --> 45:30.960
Let him do some kind of rough work.

45:32.280 --> 45:34.239
If he makes any movements,

45:34.599 --> 45:35.360
don't hesitate.

46:01.920 --> 46:02.599
Mr. Zhong.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.199
(Let's find a private place.)

46:23.960 --> 46:25.079
Mr. Zhong, have you gone fishing?

46:25.760 --> 46:28.519
There's fat fish in the river.

46:32.599 --> 46:34.280
Mr. Lu asked me to kill you.

46:38.320 --> 46:40.039
(At that time, I told Lu Zhi)

46:42.400 --> 46:44.440
(that Mr. Lu asked me to kill him.)

46:49.352 --> 46:51.239
(No Rank in Penalty)

46:53.513 --> 46:59.785
???In the middle of the bone,
and beside the blade???

46:59.913 --> 47:06.237
???There's something sweet and sticky???

47:08.201 --> 47:14.612
???Biting through the old time???

47:14.761 --> 47:20.803
???Some cry, and some sleep???

47:21.129 --> 47:28.321
???Abundant offerings
are served for sacrifice???

47:28.585 --> 47:35.658
???There are barren mounds,
with flies flying around???

47:35.945 --> 47:42.968
???Remote ancient road
and prosperous city???

47:43.369 --> 47:54.089
???Wild fires never cease,
withering and flourishing???

47:56.297 --> 48:02.691
???A few columns of smoke are curling up???

48:02.691 --> 48:09.187
???You make a wish???

48:11.049 --> 48:17.475
???Empty promises and miserable stories???

48:17.475 --> 48:23.683
???Disappear without trace???

48:23.977 --> 48:31.112
???Abundant offerings
are served for sacrifice???

48:31.305 --> 48:38.697
???There are barren mounds,
with flies flying around???

48:38.761 --> 48:45.993
???Remote ancient road
and prosperous city???

48:46.153 --> 48:53.193
???Wild fires never cease,
withering and flourishing???
