00:37.439 --> 00:39.320
There are no fish in this clear water pond

00:39.320 --> 00:41.719
It’s impossible to catch all the bad people in this world

00:42.640 --> 00:43.640
These guys are now

00:43.640 --> 00:45.359
At least they're still in my hands

00:45.359 --> 00:47.560
As long as it doesn't cause any big trouble, it'll be fine

00:48.240 --> 00:49.759
Even if something big happens

00:49.759 --> 00:51.320
I also know who to go to

00:52.200 --> 00:54.280
If there is any case really happened

00:54.799 --> 00:57.039
They almost always get some news

00:57.520 --> 00:59.520
You said we would be detectives to investigate the case

00:59.719 --> 01:00.960
How can we leave

01:00.960 --> 01:02.920
What about these people who are visiting banks?

01:03.640 --> 01:04.439
right

01:10.400 --> 01:11.439
say something

01:27.040 --> 01:27.959
I knew it

01:28.879 --> 01:31.040
You don’t even have me as a master in your eyes.

01:39.239 --> 01:40.120
master

01:40.879 --> 01:42.239
Let me rub your back

01:48.439 --> 01:49.519
Third update

01:51.280 --> 01:52.280
Master tomorrow

01:52.280 --> 01:55.560
Let you go and kill those scoundrels who visited the bank.

01:55.560 --> 01:56.959
Take them all

01:58.120 --> 01:59.159
Look good

02:00.000 --> 02:01.079
That's good

02:03.439 --> 02:04.640
Dare to be in love

02:05.760 --> 02:07.120
What a fart

02:09.479 --> 02:10.719
That gang of visiting banks

02:10.719 --> 02:12.599
Altogether there are more than 300 people

02:13.120 --> 02:14.080
how do you take it

02:15.039 --> 02:16.520
King of Thieves

02:17.000 --> 02:18.280
I take them as my own

02:18.639 --> 02:19.840
What about after taking it?

02:20.360 --> 02:21.479
How to convict

02:21.639 --> 02:23.000
They do all kinds of bad things

02:23.479 --> 02:25.479
There are plenty of victims and witnesses

02:28.240 --> 02:30.199
Sufferer and witness

02:32.560 --> 02:34.960
Intimidating the victim to buy witnesses

02:35.639 --> 02:37.599
That's their old profession.

02:37.960 --> 02:38.759
how

02:38.759 --> 02:41.039
Are you planning to steal their business?

02:44.680 --> 02:45.800
How about this

02:48.479 --> 02:50.479
Master leaves you a lesson

02:50.599 --> 02:51.960
from today

02:51.960 --> 02:53.280
you privately

02:53.280 --> 02:54.360
Go check it out secretly

02:54.360 --> 02:56.719
This helps with the income from visiting banks.

02:56.719 --> 02:58.080
Keep accounts for them

02:58.719 --> 02:59.560
see them to the end

02:59.560 --> 03:01.479
How much ill-gotten wealth has been collected?

03:01.960 --> 03:04.240
If one day you really have the chance to do it for them

03:05.159 --> 03:06.879
You just collect evidence based on the account books

03:06.879 --> 03:08.000
There are too many cases

03:08.000 --> 03:11.120
Of course there are those who are not afraid of death

03:11.120 --> 03:12.560
Witness for free

03:12.719 --> 03:13.960
can be used by you

03:17.759 --> 03:18.639
master

03:20.039 --> 03:21.439
What business did they make?

03:21.439 --> 03:22.840
They won’t reimburse me

03:24.159 --> 03:24.919
Say it again

03:25.360 --> 03:26.879
Just a serious shop

03:26.879 --> 03:27.919
If there is no ledger

03:28.280 --> 03:30.520
It's impossible to know how much money they make.

03:30.759 --> 03:33.000
Not to mention these shady deals

03:33.360 --> 03:34.240
This account

03:35.680 --> 03:36.840
How can I remember

03:37.479 --> 03:38.960
how should you remember

03:39.479 --> 03:41.360
As a teacher, you can't control that.

03:42.199 --> 03:44.520
Then you have to figure it out on your own.

03:44.759 --> 03:46.479
This supports justice

03:47.080 --> 03:48.479
It's better than giving your master a bath

03:48.479 --> 03:49.719
That would be much more laborious

05:17.279 --> 05:18.439
Puppy, you are here

05:19.120 --> 05:20.959
Go get two buckets of water from the well in the backyard.

05:26.279 --> 05:28.279
Why do you remember planting trees at this time?

05:29.000 --> 05:30.519
I heard that something happened to Feng Xiucai’s family

05:30.519 --> 05:31.560
let me see him

05:31.920 --> 05:33.720
As a result, he was caught and worked as a coolie.

05:34.199 --> 05:34.879
I originally

05:35.480 --> 05:37.279
I want to fill the hole where my uncle is buried.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.120
Then I changed my mind

05:39.720 --> 05:40.720
Anyway, the trap is here

05:41.360 --> 05:42.360
Why not plant a tree?

05:53.000 --> 05:53.959
what kind of tree is this

05:55.639 --> 05:56.399
plum bossom

06:15.399 --> 06:16.279
What do you say?

06:20.519 --> 06:22.759
Your uncle's fatal wound was on the back of his head

06:24.079 --> 06:25.759
The murderer used the copper ruler

06:25.759 --> 06:27.519
Hit him repeatedly on the back of the head

06:28.839 --> 06:30.120
The occipital bone is collapsed

06:32.800 --> 06:34.360
Stuffed in your uncle's mouth

06:34.680 --> 06:36.560
It's a headless chick

06:37.879 --> 06:38.600
chicks

06:39.800 --> 06:42.120
Newly hatched fluffy chicks

06:43.839 --> 06:44.800
Beheaded

06:50.839 --> 06:51.600
Feng Xiucai

06:55.000 --> 06:55.639
It's okay

07:03.639 --> 07:05.279
What will the county magistrate do?

07:05.399 --> 07:06.800
He felt it was serious now

07:07.959 --> 07:09.399
He actually killed two people in a row

07:10.079 --> 07:10.800
so

07:12.480 --> 07:13.600
I went to write official documents again

07:15.360 --> 07:16.600
In other words, he acquiesces

07:17.000 --> 07:18.560
Kill your master

07:18.920 --> 07:20.959
The same murderer who killed my uncle

07:21.040 --> 07:21.600
Is it right

07:28.680 --> 07:29.800
I can kill your master

07:30.120 --> 07:31.399
It's for revenge and redress of grievances

07:32.079 --> 07:33.639
Why did you kill my uncle?

07:36.759 --> 07:38.519
Could it be that Mrs. Wang

07:39.120 --> 07:41.199
What's the relationship with Lengtou'er?

07:43.360 --> 07:43.839
impossible

07:43.839 --> 07:44.480
impossible

07:48.600 --> 07:49.839
Would that be the case?

07:51.959 --> 07:54.000
The murderer went to school here when he was a child

07:55.800 --> 07:58.040
I often received the ruler from Master Wang.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.920
When I grew up, I was wronged by Lengtouer again.

08:01.319 --> 08:03.040
Since the killing has started this time,

08:03.040 --> 08:04.560
Then simply take the blow you received before

08:04.560 --> 08:05.560
Give them all back

08:07.839 --> 08:08.399
wrong

08:08.639 --> 08:10.480
Wouldn't it be better to treat those who have offended you?

08:10.480 --> 08:11.480
Killed them all

08:12.120 --> 08:13.519
How many people have to be killed?

08:14.000 --> 08:15.759
No, no, no

08:16.160 --> 08:17.160
No, no, no, no

08:17.160 --> 08:17.800
Shi Cong

08:20.399 --> 08:21.279
you're right

08:21.279 --> 08:22.399
am i right

08:25.240 --> 08:25.959
These words

08:26.279 --> 08:28.160
Just like the sacrificial words in a ceremony

08:30.680 --> 08:32.480
But why did you choose these words?

08:32.879 --> 08:34.799
Yes, why?

08:35.120 --> 08:36.559
Because there are many words

08:38.720 --> 08:39.919
What's the explanation?

08:40.399 --> 08:41.440
if it was me

08:42.879 --> 08:44.399
I just want to kill two people

08:45.759 --> 08:48.080
We also need to make it a ritual and leave a sacrificial message.

08:49.399 --> 08:51.720
The sacrificial words should be in pairs

08:52.559 --> 08:53.240
rational

08:53.600 --> 08:56.600
If the murderer only wanted to kill two people

08:58.919 --> 09:00.159
Then write a couplet

09:00.159 --> 09:01.600
It will also be more tidy

09:03.279 --> 09:06.080
So the murderer will probably kill again.

09:12.080 --> 09:13.039
Thousands of words in classics

09:14.080 --> 09:15.960
Why did he quote this sentence?

09:18.240 --> 09:18.559
Mo

09:18.559 --> 09:19.440
Mo Chunzhe

09:20.320 --> 09:21.440
Ready-made spring clothes

09:23.360 --> 09:24.519
Fifty-six winners

09:24.919 --> 09:25.919
Six or seven boys

09:28.080 --> 09:29.000
bathing in yi

09:29.799 --> 09:31.000
The wind is dancing

09:32.080 --> 09:32.960
Return with chants

09:34.240 --> 09:35.320
The puppy has learned a lot

09:36.639 --> 09:38.679
I have also recently started reading "The Analects of Confucius"

09:40.080 --> 09:41.360
This part is not difficult

09:41.879 --> 09:43.799
It's about Confucius and his four students

09:43.799 --> 09:45.240
Talking about ambitions

09:45.600 --> 09:46.759
The first three said

09:46.759 --> 09:48.519
To be a high official and do big things

09:48.720 --> 09:50.879
Only when I arrived at Zeng Xi’s place

09:51.480 --> 09:52.799
He said this

09:53.679 --> 09:54.279
this

09:55.840 --> 09:57.159
I just do not understand

09:57.440 --> 10:00.480
This passage illustrates Zeng Xi’s realm

10:01.440 --> 10:03.639
He doesn't want to be a high-ranking official of a big country

10:03.960 --> 10:05.440
No big ambitions

10:06.559 --> 10:07.679
What he yearns for most

10:07.960 --> 10:11.000
It’s just a scene of a spring outing

10:11.399 --> 10:13.440
The thing you yearn for most is the right thing

10:13.440 --> 10:14.679
you said before

10:14.679 --> 10:16.080
This murderer cited scriptures

10:16.080 --> 10:17.360
It's meant as an irony

10:17.639 --> 10:19.879
He only quoted half of the sentence "Six or Seven Boys"

10:20.320 --> 10:21.840
Your uncle is also a private school teacher

10:29.759 --> 10:30.759
It’s okay to say it

10:31.240 --> 10:33.480
If what the original text says is really what you yearn for,

10:33.799 --> 10:35.320
That irony means

10:37.120 --> 10:38.120
Regret

10:39.000 --> 10:39.919
things to regret

10:40.720 --> 10:41.720
The murderer said

10:42.559 --> 10:44.080
What did Mr. Wang do?

10:47.080 --> 10:49.039
Regrets related to children

11:12.480 --> 11:13.120
Midnight

11:15.159 --> 11:16.159
this case

11:19.759 --> 11:21.120
Can I check first?

11:23.399 --> 11:24.279
You check first

11:26.639 --> 11:28.039
I want to find out for myself

11:28.159 --> 11:29.039
Because of

11:29.840 --> 11:32.200
It's not just about how he died

11:34.120 --> 11:35.879
It’s more about how he lived

11:37.399 --> 11:38.480
What do you suspect he did?

11:38.480 --> 11:39.679
Unspeakable things

11:41.000 --> 11:42.120
I doubt he did

11:43.720 --> 11:45.360
Things that are worse than animals

11:59.120 --> 12:00.840
It must have been delivered to our house

12:02.000 --> 12:02.720
Shi Cong

12:04.480 --> 12:05.879
your errand

12:05.879 --> 12:06.759
my errand

12:09.120 --> 12:09.759
Midnight

12:10.360 --> 12:11.679
My errand doesn't matter

12:11.759 --> 12:12.559
It's you

12:12.960 --> 12:14.960
Boss Yi is going to start dealing with you now

12:16.320 --> 12:18.440
This way you will be subdued

12:19.000 --> 12:19.879
You can't fight him

12:25.600 --> 12:27.200
I prepared a big gift for him

12:29.720 --> 12:30.440
Big gift

12:31.200 --> 12:34.080
Sixty-five taels, three hundred taels

12:34.639 --> 12:35.559
Eighty taels

12:37.639 --> 12:38.480
Qu three more

12:38.960 --> 12:40.960
What did you just say this was?

12:41.639 --> 12:43.480
This is the lesson Master left for me

12:43.480 --> 12:45.159
I think it will be useful to you, Mr. Yi

12:45.879 --> 12:46.879
What do you mean

12:47.720 --> 12:49.320
I heard that visiting banks and visiting banks

12:49.320 --> 12:51.080
Thank you for being the new boss

12:51.960 --> 12:54.480
Naturally, these gangsters need to be restrained by someone.

12:54.480 --> 12:55.759
Your master is no longer here

12:55.759 --> 12:57.600
That's why I need to worry about this

12:57.879 --> 12:58.559
how

12:58.559 --> 12:59.879
Are you dissatisfied?

12:59.879 --> 13:01.639
I'm convinced

13:02.279 --> 13:03.279
Of course I understand

13:03.879 --> 13:05.480
That’s why I give you my homework

13:05.759 --> 13:06.879
Such a confusing account

13:06.879 --> 13:08.320
Only ghosts can figure it out clearly

13:08.759 --> 13:10.559
It’s not difficult to do mental arithmetic

13:12.600 --> 13:14.159
This is the first time I've heard of this

13:14.440 --> 13:15.360
Be more careful

13:18.879 --> 13:21.240
This first case is the best one

13:21.440 --> 13:23.000
It's them who go to the small shop

13:23.000 --> 13:24.840
Street money collected by small traders

13:25.159 --> 13:26.879
Walk a few times along the streets in the city

13:26.879 --> 13:28.679
How many times have we attended temple fairs?

13:28.679 --> 13:30.000
Go from house to house and ask

13:30.399 --> 13:31.480
I know everything

13:31.480 --> 13:34.120
They have a fixed income every month

13:34.519 --> 13:36.639
It's not difficult to say that

13:37.759 --> 13:39.080
Then there’s the casino treasure game

13:39.080 --> 13:40.639
and money from lending and collecting debts

13:40.759 --> 13:41.679
these two sums of money

13:41.759 --> 13:43.360
They have to take it to the bank at the end of the month.

13:43.360 --> 13:44.360
converted into silver

13:44.559 --> 13:46.360
But the specific quantity

13:47.240 --> 13:48.679
Of course they refused to tell me

13:48.679 --> 13:50.480
It took me two or three months

13:50.480 --> 13:53.480
I followed the accounting apprentices of several banks.

13:54.039 --> 13:56.159
Caught some of them visiting secret prostitutes

13:56.159 --> 13:57.759
Reasons for having an affair with a woman

13:58.000 --> 13:59.879
Only then did we get some news channels

14:00.679 --> 14:01.679
interesting

14:01.799 --> 14:03.279
Then there are the kilns in the city

14:03.279 --> 14:04.639
The secret door below

14:05.679 --> 14:07.799
These two rats and three wolves kidnapped, sold and robbed the woman

14:07.799 --> 14:09.240
They are all sent to those places

14:09.799 --> 14:11.279
Fortunately, there are several brothers in the yamen

14:11.279 --> 14:12.759
Go to those places often

14:13.440 --> 14:15.360
Who sold it and for how much

14:15.840 --> 14:17.279
I naturally found out

14:18.559 --> 14:19.360
you do not say

14:19.360 --> 14:21.279
I also know which brothers they are

14:22.000 --> 14:23.840
Naturally, this cannot be hidden from Boss Yi.

14:23.840 --> 14:25.759
The big money comes from their gambling.

14:25.759 --> 14:27.639
Fraud and false accusations

14:27.639 --> 14:29.080
Acquired real estate and land

14:29.559 --> 14:30.399
When the contract is passed

14:30.399 --> 14:31.600
All have to register at the Yamen

14:31.600 --> 14:33.720
I'll just ask Mr. Wen Li

14:34.120 --> 14:35.600
Probably just these few strokes

14:36.240 --> 14:37.000
Not difficult

14:37.000 --> 14:38.759
It's just a bit laborious

14:39.679 --> 14:41.000
how much effort did you spend

14:44.480 --> 14:45.440
About three years

14:46.960 --> 14:48.840
You actually put in so much effort

14:48.840 --> 14:51.200
It's a pity that those who hit Tai Sui and set fire to the store

14:51.200 --> 14:52.039
Immortal jump

14:52.039 --> 14:54.240
Disposal of dirty money from kidnapping

14:54.720 --> 14:56.279
I have no way of knowing

14:59.159 --> 15:00.120
Third update

15:01.720 --> 15:03.320
This is really difficult for you

15:03.440 --> 15:04.120
yes

15:04.240 --> 15:06.399
Master also said that I should not be his disciple

15:06.600 --> 15:08.679
You should find an apprentice accountant

15:09.919 --> 15:10.679
Third update

15:11.440 --> 15:14.480
I'll keep this account book and take a closer look at it.

15:15.399 --> 15:17.919
Then can you tell me

15:18.519 --> 15:19.879
them for a month

15:20.320 --> 15:21.799
How much income can there be in total?

15:22.279 --> 15:23.840
These two rats and three wolves combined

15:24.440 --> 15:25.639
A total of one month

15:26.399 --> 15:27.240
Two thousand taels, right?

15:27.240 --> 15:28.039
so much

15:29.480 --> 15:30.000
That

15:30.480 --> 15:32.200
Then do you know that they used to

15:33.159 --> 15:34.120
every month

15:35.480 --> 15:36.879
How much filial piety should I give you, Master?

15:37.399 --> 15:38.519
Master never mentioned it

15:39.120 --> 15:40.080
I didn't even ask

15:41.120 --> 15:43.399
The total sum should not exceed fifty taels.

15:44.519 --> 15:45.360
Master every month

15:45.360 --> 15:47.720
Give the Kuaiban brothers a tael of firewood and rice.

15:47.720 --> 15:49.360
Eight achievements come from here

15:54.000 --> 15:54.799
Qu three more

15:55.600 --> 15:58.600
This thing is very valuable

15:59.440 --> 16:01.200
How could you do it so easily

16:01.639 --> 16:02.840
Gave it to me

16:03.480 --> 16:05.159
This thing is in your hands, Mr. Yi

16:05.159 --> 16:06.080
Value must be tight

16:06.080 --> 16:08.200
It's worthless in my hands

16:08.559 --> 16:09.879
I finally figured it out

16:10.120 --> 16:11.200
My master is no longer here

16:11.360 --> 16:12.360
In this yamen

16:12.679 --> 16:14.360
I have to have someone take care of me.

16:17.879 --> 16:18.600
few days ago

16:18.600 --> 16:20.399
There is a place where you can offend Mr. Yi.

16:20.399 --> 16:21.799
It's because I'm young and ignorant

16:22.039 --> 16:24.200
I hope Master Yi will have a lot of them

16:24.519 --> 16:25.480
Don't take it personally

16:26.879 --> 16:27.960
get up

16:28.240 --> 16:29.559
What's going on in the middle of the night?

16:30.200 --> 16:32.120
In the past, I heard others talk about you.

16:32.840 --> 16:33.799
Not so sophisticated

16:33.960 --> 16:36.120
Relying on Master to not take people lightly

16:36.440 --> 16:37.519
Today's view

16:38.000 --> 16:39.399
Once this person becomes enlightened

16:39.399 --> 16:41.120
It's quite a workable material.

16:42.879 --> 16:43.679
do not worry

16:44.519 --> 16:45.600
You follow me back

16:46.440 --> 16:48.879
No matter how your master treated you in the past

16:49.240 --> 16:50.679
I'll add a new word

16:53.960 --> 16:55.120
I don't have anything

16:55.120 --> 16:57.320
It's the white servant who was fired two days ago.

16:57.960 --> 16:59.519
Let him suffer for me

17:00.039 --> 17:01.360
I really feel in my heart

17:02.879 --> 17:03.799
Easy to say, easy to say

17:04.920 --> 17:06.960
If you don't want me to order something

17:07.119 --> 17:08.160
This is your account book?

17:08.400 --> 17:09.759
I really don’t dare to continue

17:10.200 --> 17:11.160
A white servant

17:11.359 --> 17:12.359
Just let him come back

17:12.920 --> 17:14.200
It was originally a joke

17:14.480 --> 17:15.400
Thank you, Mr. Yi

17:15.640 --> 17:16.799
little things little things

17:18.480 --> 17:19.480
why is this

17:21.119 --> 17:22.559
Why do you give us calligraphy and painting?

17:22.680 --> 17:23.440
that is

17:32.079 --> 17:32.839
Feng Xiucai

17:33.440 --> 17:35.319
We are here today

17:35.519 --> 17:37.319
I heard that you are going to

17:37.319 --> 17:38.720
The remaining money is spent on repairing money

17:38.720 --> 17:40.079
return to us

17:40.519 --> 17:41.559
But this calligraphy and painting

17:43.279 --> 17:44.559
What's the purpose?

17:45.720 --> 17:46.680
It's not that I want to quit

17:47.519 --> 17:48.279
not you

17:48.799 --> 17:49.519
Who is that

17:50.200 --> 17:51.319
It's my uncle who wants to quit

17:52.839 --> 17:53.680
Prince Wang

17:56.519 --> 17:57.240
The day before

17:57.559 --> 17:58.759
My uncle gives a student a dream

17:59.079 --> 17:59.759
Dreaming

18:00.599 --> 18:02.079
He said he has two unfinished things on his mind

18:02.440 --> 18:03.319
What about the first one?

18:04.279 --> 18:05.240
It's this bunch of repairs

18:07.799 --> 18:09.200
Collected student tuition fees

18:09.519 --> 18:11.559
But couldn't get everything

18:11.559 --> 18:12.759
taught to students

18:13.400 --> 18:14.519
His spirit is in heaven

18:14.880 --> 18:16.000
How can I rest in peace?

18:19.599 --> 18:22.839
Master Wang is indeed a virtuous person.

18:24.039 --> 18:26.000
Those calligraphy and paintings

18:29.319 --> 18:31.759
After settling my uncle's affairs,

18:32.599 --> 18:35.279
He has very little savings left.

18:35.759 --> 18:37.200
Fortunately, I am a student

18:37.440 --> 18:39.640
He also has some attainments in calligraphy and painting

18:40.359 --> 18:42.279
It is also slightly famous in this county.

18:42.599 --> 18:43.279
Nothing better than

18:43.640 --> 18:45.559
I will give these calligraphy and paintings to everyone

18:45.759 --> 18:47.640
It's time to repay Shu Xiu

18:47.920 --> 18:49.400
I don’t know what you think?

18:49.599 --> 18:50.519
Dear parents

18:50.799 --> 18:53.640
What do you think?

18:58.519 --> 19:00.000
satisfied satisfied

19:00.359 --> 19:01.119
This is around

19:01.119 --> 19:03.480
It’s all Feng Xiucai’s wish

19:04.599 --> 19:06.359
Then since he is such a talented scholar

19:06.680 --> 19:08.559
There are still some things going on at home

19:08.559 --> 19:10.400
Just say goodbye first

19:10.400 --> 19:11.039
Wait

19:11.880 --> 19:12.599
uncle

19:13.319 --> 19:14.519
There is still one unfulfilled wish

19:15.799 --> 19:16.440
He said

19:16.880 --> 19:18.599
If it was because of his sudden departure

19:19.200 --> 19:20.720
Delayed students' studies

19:21.279 --> 19:23.680
Then he is simply unworthy of a saint

19:23.799 --> 19:24.799
Ashamed of our ancestors

19:25.680 --> 19:26.839
The more he talked, the more excited he became

19:26.839 --> 19:27.960
The more I talk, the more excited I become

19:28.400 --> 19:30.400
In the end, I couldn't help myself

19:30.400 --> 19:31.880
burst into tears

19:32.319 --> 19:32.880
this

19:34.039 --> 19:35.960
In order to appease my uncle’s spirit in heaven

19:36.759 --> 19:39.519
Why not let the students

19:39.799 --> 19:40.559
come back again

19:40.920 --> 19:42.200
How about studying for five days?

19:43.240 --> 19:44.440
Let me teach you

19:47.039 --> 19:47.839
Feng Xiucai

19:49.839 --> 19:52.119
I'm waiting and I know you have good intentions

19:53.440 --> 19:54.839
It’s not that I can’t believe you

19:55.279 --> 19:56.240
Nothing more

19:56.480 --> 19:58.839
Something like this happened in Wu Lei Zhai

19:59.160 --> 20:01.240
Let us send the child over again

20:02.279 --> 20:05.160
This is probably not appropriate.

20:06.400 --> 20:07.079
What do you say?

20:08.160 --> 20:09.000
Yeah yeah

20:09.839 --> 20:10.599
Feng Xiucai

20:11.359 --> 20:13.559
I don't have any inhibitions

20:14.559 --> 20:15.559
But this house

20:15.759 --> 20:17.839
After all, this is a place where people have died.

20:17.839 --> 20:19.240
That dog next to me?

20:19.240 --> 20:20.720
Also naturally timid

20:21.440 --> 20:24.039
I hope Feng Xiucai will forgive me.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.440
Please forgive me

20:25.960 --> 20:26.799
So to say

20:27.119 --> 20:28.599
It’s true that the students didn’t think enough about it.

20:30.000 --> 20:30.720
only

20:33.200 --> 20:34.000
My uncle

20:34.480 --> 20:36.640
He said he was going home

20:37.920 --> 20:38.759
Make up lessons for students

20:44.599 --> 20:45.599
If your son is timid

20:45.880 --> 20:47.119
Then don't sleep alone

20:48.000 --> 20:49.519
If my uncle goes there tonight,

20:49.880 --> 20:51.799
He can't memorize it without Wen Shu

20:56.559 --> 20:57.759
Students don’t force everyone

20:58.359 --> 20:59.279
Can come to make up lessons?

20:59.720 --> 21:00.519
Just raise your hand

21:06.119 --> 21:07.599
Uncle, are you keeping an eye on me?

21:07.839 --> 21:08.880
Those who raised their hands

21:09.119 --> 21:10.319
We don't need to go

21:14.079 --> 21:14.880
Thank you everyone

21:15.559 --> 21:17.200
There aren't many people who didn't raise their hands.

21:17.519 --> 21:18.440
That's it

21:18.680 --> 21:20.519
It’s not too hard for my uncle

21:51.480 --> 21:52.400
I still want to drink

21:53.200 --> 21:53.960
I want to drink

21:54.039 --> 21:55.720
Sir, let me help you in

22:02.000 --> 22:02.759
Master Song

22:03.000 --> 22:05.119
Teach me how to compose poetry next time

22:08.240 --> 22:09.839
Why do you want to learn poetry?

22:10.240 --> 22:11.640
I don't look good

22:12.519 --> 22:13.680
I can’t play or sing

22:14.480 --> 22:15.960
Never get on the stage

22:16.279 --> 22:18.240
Sister Yingrui can’t play or sing either

22:18.480 --> 22:19.720
But the poem is good

22:19.920 --> 22:21.200
So there are many patrons

22:24.079 --> 22:25.720
Can everyone write poetry?

22:27.480 --> 22:29.519
Sister Yingrui’s life is so good

22:30.440 --> 22:31.440
Can compose poetry

22:32.440 --> 22:34.240
Fresh fish to eat every day

22:38.319 --> 22:39.480
How delicious the fish is

22:42.720 --> 22:43.319
Harukan

22:44.359 --> 22:46.000
You can also eat fish today, right?

22:46.000 --> 22:46.720
that is

22:47.400 --> 22:49.000
It's all thanks to Mr. Song

22:49.119 --> 22:51.000
I've already gone to the kitchen and begged the cook

22:51.000 --> 22:52.240
give me a big one

22:54.920 --> 22:56.960
Your mother Lin is really stingy

22:58.240 --> 22:59.119
Although there are few guests

22:59.880 --> 23:01.759
Eating a fish can make her exhausted

23:02.759 --> 23:03.759
Don’t I still have Mr. Song?

23:03.759 --> 23:04.839
Such a benefactor?

23:05.319 --> 23:07.200
Master Song pampers me once a month

23:07.480 --> 23:08.400
I'm a month old

23:08.400 --> 23:10.440
I can eat fresh fish at least once

23:18.519 --> 23:19.160
Harukan

23:20.400 --> 23:21.119
That

23:21.920 --> 23:24.119
How about I come again this month?

23:25.079 --> 23:26.119
Of course

23:28.519 --> 23:31.640
Then you won't come twice this month

23:32.839 --> 23:34.319
You won’t be coming next month, right?

23:36.000 --> 23:36.880
of course

23:37.599 --> 23:38.640
Come again this month

23:38.839 --> 23:39.880
I'm going to borrow money

23:40.119 --> 23:41.920
Then you can’t pay it back next month?

23:45.720 --> 23:48.119
Then Mr. Song should come back next month.

23:48.640 --> 23:50.079
Eat fish twice a month

23:50.960 --> 23:52.480
No fish to eat next month

23:53.240 --> 23:55.240
Might as well eat it once a month

23:56.119 --> 23:57.160
Why is this?

23:59.400 --> 24:00.839
No matter what he does next month

24:01.240 --> 24:03.480
Wouldn’t it be nice to have it again this month?

24:03.759 --> 24:04.440
not good

24:07.000 --> 24:07.880
because

24:08.640 --> 24:10.079
Because fish is hope

24:20.880 --> 24:21.519
Harukan

24:24.440 --> 24:25.920
What if I never come again?

24:29.400 --> 24:30.200
or

24:31.640 --> 24:32.720
I'll come again

24:34.279 --> 24:35.240
I'm not looking for you again

24:37.920 --> 24:38.640
Master Song

24:39.680 --> 24:40.920
Did I say the wrong thing?

24:42.839 --> 24:43.759
Fish is not hope

24:44.640 --> 24:45.880
Mr. Song is the one we hope for

24:46.480 --> 24:47.759
Mr. Song is the one we hope for

24:54.519 --> 24:55.200
Harukan

24:57.960 --> 24:59.119
your hope

25:00.000 --> 25:00.880
It should be fish

25:02.119 --> 25:03.000
It shouldn't be me

25:03.720 --> 25:04.640
you have to remember

25:05.519 --> 25:06.799
Never treat people

25:08.359 --> 25:09.279
as hope

25:10.079 --> 25:10.799
Do you understand?

25:18.240 --> 25:20.799
Okay, it's time to go

25:23.640 --> 25:24.640
Chunxing sees off guests

25:34.480 --> 25:35.240
Song Dynasty History

25:35.240 --> 25:37.039
A friend already knows how to pass money for you

25:37.799 --> 25:38.440
friend

25:39.240 --> 25:39.839
yes

25:42.799 --> 25:43.680
Song Dynasty History

25:44.240 --> 25:45.240
It's this friend

25:48.960 --> 25:49.839
Song Dynasty History

25:50.759 --> 25:51.799
Rarely rare

25:52.160 --> 25:53.440
Do you remember the villain?

25:54.279 --> 25:56.799
The villain Zhang Jizu is Xue Juren’s housekeeper

26:00.920 --> 26:02.039
Who do I think I am?

26:02.839 --> 26:03.680
turn out to be

26:04.880 --> 26:05.880
It’s Butler Zhang

26:08.480 --> 26:10.039
Is the injury on your hand serious?

26:11.480 --> 26:12.559
Injury on hand

26:13.759 --> 26:15.119
Song Dianshi, what are you talking about?

26:16.119 --> 26:17.359
You and I have no contact

26:17.799 --> 26:19.599
If it hadn't been for the silver bitten hand

26:19.599 --> 26:21.200
How can you learn money for me?

26:22.519 --> 26:23.319
Song Dynasty History

26:26.559 --> 26:27.839
Where can I send this to you?

26:29.079 --> 26:30.440
I have a donkey, what use do you have?

26:30.440 --> 26:31.839
I can lead the donkey for you

26:31.920 --> 26:32.400
Come

26:32.799 --> 26:33.480
Walk

26:37.920 --> 26:38.720
Song Dynasty History

26:39.400 --> 26:40.640
I won’t hide anything from you either, villain.

26:40.920 --> 26:42.359
I really want to ask for something

26:44.480 --> 26:45.240
Rouge Lane

26:45.440 --> 26:47.359
It's at the back door of Cuihua Building

26:47.359 --> 26:49.000
There is an abandoned house without an owner

26:49.640 --> 26:51.000
It's been abandoned for many years

26:51.599 --> 26:54.359
Do you think the county can sell it to me?

26:54.559 --> 26:56.839
How much does it cost? You have the final say

26:57.279 --> 26:59.559
As for how much to report to the county?

26:59.759 --> 27:01.039
It's you who have the final say

27:01.519 --> 27:03.279
This is what it means

27:03.480 --> 27:05.119
I happen to know that yard

27:06.079 --> 27:08.799
But it's not some abandoned house without an owner.

27:08.960 --> 27:09.599
Have a master

27:10.519 --> 27:11.200
Have a master

27:12.559 --> 27:13.400
Wrong?

27:14.319 --> 27:15.759
Everyone has asked about it

27:16.279 --> 27:17.640
It has been abandoned for many years

27:17.759 --> 27:19.240
The grass is as tall as one person

27:19.240 --> 27:20.519
The house is about to collapse

27:21.319 --> 27:22.960
The cold catcher came to see me last month

27:22.960 --> 27:24.319
I told you about that yard

27:24.319 --> 27:25.200
Cold catcher

27:28.319 --> 27:29.759
The one who died two days ago

27:33.359 --> 27:34.400
he tells me

27:35.279 --> 27:37.079
That yard has been abandoned

27:37.920 --> 27:40.079
There are often some beggars

27:40.079 --> 27:41.079
gather there

27:41.079 --> 27:42.359
to compete for space

27:42.359 --> 27:44.079
They often get into fights

27:44.359 --> 27:45.119
he ask me

27:45.119 --> 27:47.559
Can the county seal that courtyard gate with bricks?

27:48.559 --> 27:49.559
I just checked

27:50.440 --> 27:51.880
Only then did I know six years ago

27:52.319 --> 27:53.440
The county has put it

27:54.039 --> 27:55.599
It was handed over to a foreign merchant.

27:56.960 --> 27:57.440
Can

27:57.440 --> 27:58.000
Walk

27:58.359 --> 27:59.799
I went to see it a few days ago

27:59.799 --> 28:01.319
That yard is still deserted

28:01.839 --> 28:03.799
You said that your Xue family has a great cause

28:03.799 --> 28:05.279
Why do you need a poor yard?

28:06.799 --> 28:08.319
It’s not what our master wants

28:08.519 --> 28:09.839
It's me, the villain

28:10.400 --> 28:12.920
You see, this little guy is already in his forties.

28:13.160 --> 28:14.240
I also want to have a family

28:14.799 --> 28:16.079
I was thinking about the yard

28:16.079 --> 28:17.519
Although not very auspicious

28:17.759 --> 28:19.200
But I want to get a bargain

28:20.400 --> 28:21.839
It’s so cheap that I’m afraid I can’t show it in the picture.

28:22.799 --> 28:23.880
that master

28:24.359 --> 28:25.640
I heard he was a businessman

28:26.200 --> 28:28.079
I have never lived in the yard since I bought it.

28:28.079 --> 28:29.680
And where is he now?

28:30.039 --> 28:31.000
do not know either

28:33.880 --> 28:34.680
No wonder

28:35.839 --> 28:37.160
I went to see it the day before yesterday

28:38.000 --> 28:39.720
The yard is still deserted

28:40.279 --> 28:41.240
But in the yard

28:42.039 --> 28:43.160
Something more

28:48.440 --> 28:50.160
How did you know about that yard?

28:55.799 --> 28:58.519
Before that, it was Chen Wang’s yard

29:00.119 --> 29:03.200
That courtyard is right next to Cuihua Building

29:03.599 --> 29:05.039
Kill Leng and catch the head

29:05.640 --> 29:07.240
That's perfect

29:08.039 --> 29:09.440
I don’t know the history of Song Dynasty either

29:09.839 --> 29:11.200
Can you find out anything?

29:11.599 --> 29:14.359
That Song Chen is by no means an idle person

29:14.960 --> 29:17.599
I heard that Leng Captou’s apprentice

29:17.599 --> 29:18.640
Asking around

29:18.640 --> 29:20.480
The fire twenty years ago

29:22.480 --> 29:23.759
Keep an eye on him first

29:24.680 --> 29:27.519
That Lu Zhi is no longer in this world

29:28.440 --> 29:30.039
See what they can find out

29:33.720 --> 29:34.920
Luzhai is very big

29:35.440 --> 29:36.680
There are four courtyards

29:37.480 --> 29:38.960
There is a corner gate very close to me

29:39.240 --> 29:40.279
I remember it clearly

29:40.519 --> 29:43.000
The fire at that corner door was the most intense.

29:43.039 --> 29:44.920
The fire was caused by accident

29:44.920 --> 29:47.039
Falling candle causes fire

29:47.039 --> 29:50.039
The fire started in the owner's bedroom of the main building.

29:50.039 --> 29:52.640
Spreading everywhere, every house is on fire

29:52.640 --> 29:54.079
The host’s family of four

29:54.079 --> 29:57.559
Master Lu Jinxin and mistress Lu Zou

29:57.559 --> 29:58.759
The eldest son Lu Buyou

29:59.039 --> 30:01.519
The second daughter Lu Pinger passed away

30:01.759 --> 30:03.039
Butler Lu Zhong

30:03.039 --> 30:05.480
Maid Pomegranate and Begonia

30:05.480 --> 30:07.799
Servant's wife, Zhang's family, Li's family, Ji's family

30:07.799 --> 30:09.480
All died in the fire

30:09.480 --> 30:12.079
Watchman Qu Tianming died while putting out a fire

30:12.200 --> 30:14.440
Watchman Qu Tianming

30:15.359 --> 30:16.359
Dad in the middle of the night

30:17.519 --> 30:18.440
I remembered

30:18.440 --> 30:19.319
There is a man named Chen

30:19.319 --> 30:20.279
He's a servant of the Lu family

30:20.559 --> 30:22.720
Called Chen Chen Chen Wang

30:22.960 --> 30:23.799
He didn't burn to death

30:24.000 --> 30:25.359
I heard he wasn't burned to death

30:25.359 --> 30:27.319
It's because there are stars that illuminate your destiny

30:27.920 --> 30:29.559
This person is good at gambling

30:29.799 --> 30:32.279
Taking advantage of his good fortune, he went to the provincial capital and made a big bet.

30:32.279 --> 30:33.200
Made a fortune

30:33.279 --> 30:34.240
Also bought a house

30:34.799 --> 30:37.319
It seems to be over there in Rouge Lane

30:40.880 --> 30:41.720
Rouge Lane

30:43.160 --> 30:44.759
Over there at the back door of Tsui Wah Building

30:46.359 --> 30:47.000
villain

30:47.680 --> 30:48.359
How could a villain know?

30:48.359 --> 30:49.759
Where is the back door of Cuihua Building?

30:51.000 --> 30:51.839
What happened later?

30:52.119 --> 30:55.039
Later, he ran out of luck

30:55.039 --> 30:56.599
I heard that he was in debt

30:56.599 --> 30:57.599
The house is gone too

30:57.839 --> 30:58.960
Just jumped into the river and died.

31:00.039 --> 31:01.559
What did you say that person's name was?

31:02.240 --> 31:03.000
Chen Wang

31:04.799 --> 31:06.039
Some people say

31:06.440 --> 31:09.000
The Lu family had an adopted son who was not burned to death.

31:09.319 --> 31:10.200
survived

31:10.400 --> 31:11.079
adopted child

31:11.440 --> 31:13.240
Speaking of this adopted son of the Lu family?

31:13.240 --> 31:14.640
I have seen it before

31:14.640 --> 31:17.319
I was only fifteen or sixteen years old at that time.

31:17.839 --> 31:20.559
It is said that he was picked up by the Lu family before.

31:20.559 --> 31:22.680
A little beggar who is about to starve to death

31:23.000 --> 31:25.519
Be a book boy for the Lu family uncle

31:26.000 --> 31:27.440
Very appreciated

31:27.960 --> 31:30.559
Later he recognized him as his godson

31:31.519 --> 31:35.119
What is his name? What is his name?

31:37.000 --> 31:37.599
land

31:39.079 --> 31:41.640
If the road is not straight, look for Lu Zhi

31:41.839 --> 31:44.039
It’s time to reach the sky in one step

31:44.279 --> 31:46.039
Call him Lu Zhi

31:46.240 --> 31:48.359
Bookboy Lu Zhi's servant Chen Wang

31:48.519 --> 31:50.640
Zhang Gui, chef of the nursing home, You Er

31:50.799 --> 31:53.079
These four people survived

31:54.000 --> 31:54.799
Brother Liu

31:55.039 --> 31:57.279
Where are the four surviving people now?

31:57.920 --> 31:59.440
How do you know this?

31:59.759 --> 32:00.799
We can't let them

32:00.799 --> 32:02.400
Report to the Yamen regularly

32:05.680 --> 32:07.559
Then I want to check the household registration of these four people.

32:07.720 --> 32:08.640
Check household registration

32:09.000 --> 32:09.720
OK

32:10.200 --> 32:10.960
Please move

32:11.160 --> 32:12.799
Huangceku next door

32:13.559 --> 32:15.480
Forgive me, I still have serious official duties to attend to.

32:15.799 --> 32:16.720
Check it yourself

32:18.119 --> 32:18.680
OK

32:19.279 --> 32:20.359
Check it yourself, check it yourself

32:48.000 --> 32:48.799
Song Dynasty History

32:49.000 --> 32:50.799
The abandoned yard in Rouge Lane

32:50.799 --> 32:52.279
The villain went to investigate

32:54.359 --> 32:55.440
What is the result

32:55.599 --> 32:56.240
one

32:56.640 --> 32:58.400
There is a place on the courtyard wall that was newly repaired

32:58.599 --> 33:00.039
Looks like it used to be a hole

33:00.559 --> 33:02.079
The second one is obviously the stone mill

33:02.359 --> 33:03.920
That stone mill has not polished anything.

33:04.279 --> 33:06.359
Because no matter whether you grind rice or flour or grind beans,

33:06.680 --> 33:08.640
There will definitely be marks on the grindstone

33:09.079 --> 33:10.440
This one is polished clean

33:10.440 --> 33:11.200
However

33:11.519 --> 33:12.319
The weird thing is

33:12.680 --> 33:13.680
Grind around

33:14.480 --> 33:15.720
There are many donkey hoof prints

33:16.640 --> 33:17.720
Like that donkey

33:18.400 --> 33:19.519
As if carrying a heavy load

33:20.079 --> 33:21.240
Kick the ground with all your strength

33:21.880 --> 33:22.960
Song Dianshi is right

33:23.720 --> 33:25.880
Donkey light grinding does not require so much effort

33:27.559 --> 33:29.799
That courtyard is where Master was killed.

33:32.359 --> 33:33.279
How to see

33:33.640 --> 33:36.119
The courtyard is next to the back door of Cuihua Building

33:36.680 --> 33:37.480
Tsui Wah House

33:38.599 --> 33:40.400
What does Tsui Wah Building have to do with your master?

33:43.880 --> 33:44.640
Go on

33:49.200 --> 33:50.599
My master was hanged

33:52.359 --> 33:54.559
The murderer must have killed the courtyard gate.

33:55.000 --> 33:55.640
What to use

33:55.640 --> 33:57.599
It led Master to drill the hole in the wall.

33:59.920 --> 34:01.640
The murderer must have happened when the master was drilling the hole

34:01.640 --> 34:03.519
Put a rope around his neck

34:08.800 --> 34:10.239
rope tangled in mill

34:15.320 --> 34:16.840
Then use a donkey to grind it

34:16.840 --> 34:18.480
Hang the master on the stake

34:28.239 --> 34:29.239
What are you still doing?

34:32.400 --> 34:33.199
Go on errands

35:14.639 --> 35:15.880
Two great masters of officialdom

35:16.400 --> 35:17.920
Is there anything you need a villain to do?

35:18.159 --> 35:19.280
Just as you two are told

35:19.719 --> 35:21.159
You are the stonemason Si Baozhu

35:22.039 --> 35:22.559
yes

35:22.760 --> 35:24.519
The villain is the stonemason Si Baozhu

35:24.519 --> 35:25.840
Let's go to the Yamen and talk.

35:42.039 --> 35:43.000
This bamboo stick

35:44.599 --> 35:46.800
I'll nail it under your fingernails in a moment

35:48.519 --> 35:50.320
At most, it can only be nailed in two inches.

35:51.159 --> 35:52.119
But it hurts a lot

35:53.280 --> 35:54.159
A pain

35:54.719 --> 35:55.760
Maybe you can do it

35:56.559 --> 35:57.599
Come to punishment

35:57.599 --> 35:58.719
Please don't let me

35:58.719 --> 36:00.239
Sir, I am a mason

36:00.800 --> 36:02.440
You can't destroy my hands

36:02.440 --> 36:05.039
I point to these hands to support my family

36:05.480 --> 36:06.880
Then let me give you some advice

36:07.159 --> 36:08.159
eighth day of this month

36:11.039 --> 36:12.000
where are you

36:12.320 --> 36:13.199
I'm in the work shed

36:13.199 --> 36:14.639
I've been working in the shed

36:14.639 --> 36:15.519
It’s been two months

36:15.519 --> 36:16.679
I never left

36:17.760 --> 36:18.880
Have you never left?

36:18.880 --> 36:19.639
No

36:20.519 --> 36:22.360
No, I never left

36:23.079 --> 36:24.800
mid-August

36:24.800 --> 36:26.119
I went to the city

36:26.440 --> 36:27.960
I went to work for others.

36:28.079 --> 36:28.920
What kind of work

36:29.119 --> 36:30.920
Just a stone mill

36:31.159 --> 36:34.079
My son and I deliver it to people’s homes together

36:34.079 --> 36:36.519
Just in a yard on Rouge Lane

36:37.159 --> 36:40.039
That yard looks like it's going to be abandoned.

36:40.320 --> 36:42.360
The customer said that he wanted to change it into a tofu shop.

36:42.360 --> 36:44.519
That’s why I ordered the stone mill.

36:45.280 --> 36:46.679
What does that guest look like?

36:47.239 --> 36:48.280
that guest

36:49.239 --> 36:50.800
About seven feet away

36:50.960 --> 36:52.000
He's weird

36:52.360 --> 36:54.039
He always wears a bamboo hat

36:54.280 --> 36:57.440
The day he came to place the order, it was raining

36:57.440 --> 36:59.239
So I'm not surprised

36:59.239 --> 37:01.800
But it didn’t rain on the day I went to work

37:01.800 --> 37:03.360
He still wears that hat

37:04.199 --> 37:04.960
Take a look

37:06.480 --> 37:07.079
Thanks

37:09.039 --> 37:10.519
Come let's go

37:11.920 --> 37:14.119
You didn't see the guest's face clearly

37:14.519 --> 37:16.760
I saw it

37:17.159 --> 37:18.920
I just don't know what to say

37:20.199 --> 37:21.440
That beard of his

37:21.440 --> 37:23.880
He looks like the judge in the temple

37:29.119 --> 37:30.079
Anything else?

37:30.400 --> 37:31.400
No more master

37:31.400 --> 37:32.400
I said it all

37:37.639 --> 37:38.840
You have to tell the truth

37:39.840 --> 37:41.559
I have seen that person

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
Can't hide it from me

37:46.039 --> 37:46.840
bearded

37:48.079 --> 37:48.679
correct

37:49.440 --> 37:50.559
His hands are very thin

37:51.000 --> 37:52.039
Still have nails

37:53.679 --> 37:54.320
Thanks

37:58.719 --> 37:59.239
Come

37:59.239 --> 38:00.199
Let’s put them in jail first

38:01.599 --> 38:02.800
Sir, I told you everything

38:02.800 --> 38:04.719
What I said is all the truth, sir.

38:04.719 --> 38:06.000
Master, I am wronged, Master

38:06.440 --> 38:07.320
I'm wronged

38:08.239 --> 38:09.000
master

38:09.480 --> 38:10.880
Sir, I am wronged

38:12.480 --> 38:13.239
Song Dynasty History

38:13.239 --> 38:14.880
How long will this mason be locked up?

38:14.880 --> 38:15.840
Close to solving the case

38:18.760 --> 38:19.440
What

38:20.000 --> 38:21.360
Five hundred taels per month

38:21.920 --> 38:24.320
That's a drop in the bucket for you.

38:24.679 --> 38:26.880
Didn’t I just say fifty taels a few days ago?

38:26.880 --> 38:27.960
I didn't know a few days ago

38:27.960 --> 38:29.239
In the pot of several heads

38:29.239 --> 38:30.719
There is so much oil and water

38:30.920 --> 38:31.960
Several heads of household

38:33.239 --> 38:34.400
the whole county

38:34.679 --> 38:35.639
Scholars, farmers, industry and commerce

38:35.639 --> 38:36.880
Traffickers and pawns

38:37.440 --> 38:39.559
Which one does not rely on the government for food?

38:39.840 --> 38:41.480
How did you end up on your street?

38:41.760 --> 38:43.360
It becomes you eating meat

38:43.679 --> 38:45.159
Let's have soup at the yamen door

38:45.960 --> 38:46.719
Is this true?

38:46.960 --> 38:48.519
Bullshit eating meat and drinking soup

38:49.159 --> 38:50.719
You are making us brothers

38:50.719 --> 38:51.760
Drink the northwest wind

38:51.760 --> 38:52.840
You have many brothers, right?

38:53.000 --> 38:54.119
I have a lot of brothers too

38:55.000 --> 38:55.920
I tell you

38:56.159 --> 38:57.079
from now on

38:57.719 --> 38:59.079
Routine five hundred taels per month

38:59.079 --> 39:00.519
No penny should be lost and nothing less

39:01.280 --> 39:03.679
Is there another lawsuit?

39:03.960 --> 39:04.800
Let's calculate it separately

39:13.800 --> 39:14.519
Yi Tou'er

39:15.079 --> 39:17.800
What we are talking about is buying and selling.

39:18.440 --> 39:20.000
This business business

39:20.719 --> 39:22.440
It can't be a death wish.

39:24.599 --> 39:25.400
Are you cold?

39:27.480 --> 39:28.920
The water is cold

39:29.440 --> 39:30.159
Someone coming

39:30.480 --> 39:31.760
add some boiling water

39:32.320 --> 39:33.079
coming

39:42.960 --> 39:43.559
what to do

39:57.719 --> 39:58.440
I'm easy to rely on

39:58.440 --> 40:01.440
Now he is the captain of two shifts in Zaobao

40:01.960 --> 40:04.119
I hold your life and death in my hands.

40:04.639 --> 40:05.679
Talk to me about business

40:05.960 --> 40:06.760
What to talk about

40:09.320 --> 40:10.639
I advise you to be smarter

40:10.800 --> 40:12.840
Spend the money to buy yourself a way out.

40:13.880 --> 40:14.719
Yi

40:15.440 --> 40:17.079
Don't make things impossible

40:18.840 --> 40:20.320
I think it's too stuffy here

40:20.559 --> 40:22.320
Several heads of household have lost their heads

40:22.320 --> 40:23.679
You forgot about yourself, right?

40:24.280 --> 40:25.119
Bros

40:25.400 --> 40:26.440
Fork them out

40:26.800 --> 40:28.480
Let them cool down and breathe

40:28.599 --> 40:29.480
sober sober

40:56.480 --> 40:58.119
Bare buttocks are really indecent

40:58.119 --> 40:59.960
Give them a list to cover up their shame

41:18.159 --> 41:18.719
daughter

41:18.880 --> 41:20.119
The third update is back

41:20.880 --> 41:22.440
Did the lanterns go out today?

41:22.719 --> 41:23.679
Didn't kill my mother

41:23.960 --> 41:24.800
It's on

41:30.599 --> 41:31.639
What's wrong? Three updates

41:32.079 --> 41:33.159
What happened

41:35.559 --> 41:36.440
It's okay, mother

41:36.760 --> 41:37.519
It's fine

41:40.960 --> 41:41.480
kneel

41:43.760 --> 41:47.280
The Wuhou Mansion respectfully invites Brother San Geng to come and discuss matters.

41:47.920 --> 41:48.480
do not go

41:48.960 --> 41:50.119
Don't go in the middle of the night

41:51.320 --> 41:52.239
It's okay, mother

41:53.239 --> 41:54.599
I'm waiting for them

41:57.639 --> 41:58.400
lead the way

42:22.599 --> 42:23.719
five heads

42:25.199 --> 42:27.079
Why did you call me here today?

42:27.440 --> 42:28.280
Third update

42:30.119 --> 42:31.840
The cold case

42:32.679 --> 42:34.960
We actually care more than anyone else

42:35.079 --> 42:38.079
We are doing our best these days to check

42:38.199 --> 42:40.000
Clues about that case

42:40.320 --> 42:43.199
However, I also found some fragmentary information.

42:47.400 --> 42:49.519
Widow Zhao in Ping Anli

42:49.519 --> 42:50.679
Got hooked up recently

42:50.679 --> 42:52.400
Wang Shun, the walking second boss

42:52.400 --> 42:54.639
Where is this widow Zhao’s dead man?

42:54.800 --> 42:55.800
Called Wu Jinlong

42:55.800 --> 42:58.079
He was killed because of a fight

42:58.079 --> 42:59.440
It was also taken by Lengtouer.

42:59.440 --> 43:01.639
Liu Shitou from Siyanjing Street

43:01.639 --> 43:02.840
Came back a few days ago

43:03.039 --> 43:05.039
Liu Shitou was accused of stealing in the past

43:05.039 --> 43:06.199
Taken by a cold head

43:06.440 --> 43:07.440
I hit forty boards at that time

43:07.519 --> 43:08.239
Grand Marquis

43:08.960 --> 43:10.599
Bring it over and let me see for myself

43:22.119 --> 43:23.519
Thank you to the five leaders

43:23.519 --> 43:24.960
I will pay attention to these people

43:25.400 --> 43:27.079
I hope the five of you can continue to investigate.

43:27.679 --> 43:28.960
Help me solve the case as soon as possible

43:30.280 --> 43:31.199
That's for sure

43:31.199 --> 43:32.039
The third update

43:33.320 --> 43:34.480
I'll say goodbye first.

43:35.920 --> 43:36.599
Midnight

43:37.039 --> 43:38.679
Don't leave in a hurry

43:38.679 --> 43:40.840
We prepared some meat and wine

43:41.039 --> 43:42.280
Thinking of our brothers

43:42.519 --> 43:43.679
How many drinks should I have?

43:43.679 --> 43:44.400
Grand Marquis

43:45.480 --> 43:47.119
I'll tell you straight up at the third update.

43:47.360 --> 43:48.480
You call me over

43:49.239 --> 43:50.800
I'm afraid it's not for clues

43:51.360 --> 43:52.880
It’s not just for the bar.

43:54.280 --> 43:55.719
I won't mince words.

43:55.880 --> 43:57.480
I really want to ask for something.

43:57.480 --> 43:58.880
If it's because of that Yi Bantou matter

43:58.880 --> 43:59.880
No need to say it

44:00.119 --> 44:01.920
He is the head coach of both shifts

44:02.280 --> 44:03.719
I'm a little catcher

44:04.639 --> 44:05.679
I can't help you

44:07.079 --> 44:07.760
Midnight

44:08.039 --> 44:09.440
Don't say such things

44:09.800 --> 44:11.679
Someone who can fight with Boss Yi

44:11.800 --> 44:13.159
It's just you

44:13.559 --> 44:14.360
Midnight

44:14.360 --> 44:15.519
If you don't help us

44:16.119 --> 44:18.360
Just scrape together the monthly money

44:18.440 --> 44:19.480
It's going to burn your ass

44:19.800 --> 44:21.039
We don't have the energy to spare

44:22.320 --> 44:23.360
No energy left

44:23.519 --> 44:25.480
Stop worrying about other things

44:26.159 --> 44:27.440
Dahouye means

44:28.679 --> 44:29.679
If I have no choice

44:29.679 --> 44:31.039
Help you deal with Boss Yi

44:32.159 --> 44:33.280
There's nothing you can do

44:33.280 --> 44:34.840
Investigate Master's case

44:35.599 --> 44:36.920
That's not overly ambitious

44:38.679 --> 44:40.559
But is it not strong enough?

44:40.960 --> 44:41.639
Marquis

44:42.360 --> 44:44.599
Then Boss Yi is nothing more than a money-seeker.

44:45.440 --> 44:47.119
Just scare him.

44:48.239 --> 44:50.840
Brothers under you, go up to the house and unveil the tiles

44:50.840 --> 44:53.159
He is very skilled at stealing and setting fire.

44:55.360 --> 44:56.360
To put it bluntly

44:57.480 --> 44:59.880
Even if you unknowingly take him

45:03.320 --> 45:05.400
It shouldn't be too difficult for you, right?

45:08.280 --> 45:09.039
useless

45:09.440 --> 45:10.599
Absolutely no chance

45:10.599 --> 45:11.719
How to avoid it

45:13.079 --> 45:14.039
Third update

45:15.199 --> 45:17.239
Do you know that in this world?

45:17.519 --> 45:19.360
Whether he is a robber or not

45:19.679 --> 45:20.679
mountainous

45:20.679 --> 45:22.679
Even if it's a burglary

45:23.119 --> 45:25.440
He can call himself Green Forest Road

45:25.719 --> 45:28.639
We are the only ones who visit banks

45:29.360 --> 45:30.119
he can not

45:31.960 --> 45:32.880
why is this

45:34.440 --> 45:36.079
Because we are just like you

45:36.199 --> 45:38.039
They are all raised by the Yamen.

45:48.159 --> 45:49.000
What did you say

45:49.679 --> 45:51.639
Speaking of our Wuhou Mansion

45:52.039 --> 45:53.280
people in the county

45:53.480 --> 45:54.599
Who is not afraid of us?

45:55.039 --> 45:56.639
But is that our power?

45:56.800 --> 45:57.559
no

45:57.800 --> 45:59.519
That is the power of the yamen

46:00.760 --> 46:02.480
The people in the county are afraid of us

46:02.480 --> 46:04.159
Not because there are many of us

46:04.440 --> 46:05.280
Cruel

46:05.440 --> 46:07.880
But because no matter what we do

46:07.880 --> 46:10.159
The yamen will ignore it and ignore it.

46:10.159 --> 46:12.679
So we made a rule

46:12.679 --> 46:13.639
What rules

46:14.079 --> 46:15.440
No harm to officials

46:15.679 --> 46:16.719
in this case

46:17.400 --> 46:20.159
This is the Wuhou Mansion that everyone in Ding County is afraid of.

46:21.199 --> 46:23.440
I don't dare to hurt a supervisor in the yamen.

46:24.320 --> 46:25.920
That's something I absolutely wouldn't dare to do

46:30.280 --> 46:30.880
Marquis

46:32.039 --> 46:34.639
I heard that at other government offices

46:35.079 --> 46:36.719
You are the ones who visit and fawn over

46:36.719 --> 46:38.719
He's not just a fast-track catcher, right?

46:41.480 --> 46:42.480
Logically speaking

46:43.360 --> 46:45.000
The classic history of this county

46:45.559 --> 46:47.360
In charge of prison sentences

46:47.960 --> 46:50.360
He should be the rightful owner

46:51.039 --> 46:53.360
Just like the Ma Dianshi in Ji County next door

46:53.360 --> 46:55.239
That takes good care of the brothers

46:56.400 --> 46:57.920
Take a look at our Song Dynasty history

46:57.920 --> 47:00.079
That's a moody mood.

47:00.280 --> 47:01.840
He doesn't know what the path is.

47:01.840 --> 47:04.079
All the previous county magistrates had nothing to do with him.

47:04.280 --> 47:05.360
What do you mean?

47:05.360 --> 47:07.519
How can we get through this?

47:07.679 --> 47:08.840
Have you been there?

47:09.000 --> 47:10.159
How come I didn’t pass by

47:10.840 --> 47:13.519
People say that you should never hit someone with a smiling face.

47:14.199 --> 47:15.440
But this Song Dianshi?

47:15.639 --> 47:17.079
Even those who gave money were beaten

47:17.199 --> 47:19.400
Other officials are like geese plucking their hair.

47:19.400 --> 47:20.119
But what about him?

47:22.119 --> 47:23.880
It's because someone had a tooth pulled out

47:24.400 --> 47:25.599
Of course I know this

47:25.840 --> 47:27.840
So this method is also there

47:29.840 --> 47:30.840
any solution

47:31.199 --> 47:34.119
Let Bantou Yi go give money to Song Dianshi

47:34.440 --> 47:35.199
no

47:35.440 --> 47:36.679
No, no, no

47:37.320 --> 47:40.039
Even we all know the character of Song Dianshi

47:40.760 --> 47:42.679
How could he hit a brick wall?

47:42.679 --> 47:44.639
If you hit the south wall, you can get money.

47:46.559 --> 47:48.880
Then Boss Yi shouldn’t be beaten to death alive?

47:53.320 --> 47:54.599
I see

47:54.840 --> 47:57.480
As long as the money is enough

47:57.480 --> 47:59.320
Let me make a bet with the five bosses.

48:00.519 --> 48:01.840
You give him one thousand taels of silver

48:01.840 --> 48:03.960
Let him go to Song Dianshi to clear up the lawsuit

48:04.440 --> 48:05.239
Guess

48:06.559 --> 48:07.880
How much will he keep?

48:08.440 --> 48:10.280
I bet five hundred taels

48:11.800 --> 48:13.480
These two hundred taels are the foreshadowing

48:14.119 --> 48:15.400
The Guo family of the oil shop said

48:15.679 --> 48:17.280
As long as they let their young master go

48:17.599 --> 48:19.239
There is still filial piety afterwards

48:37.599 --> 48:38.440
Yi Bantou

48:39.480 --> 48:40.639
I heard

48:41.639 --> 48:42.920
The Young Master of the Oil Factory

48:44.639 --> 48:46.559
But breaking someone's legs

48:47.239 --> 48:47.880
yes

48:48.320 --> 48:50.079
But does that count as a reason?

48:50.639 --> 48:51.760
Who let that kid

48:51.760 --> 48:55.000
You kicked Shaodong’s dog first, right?

49:05.639 --> 49:06.760
you mean

49:09.039 --> 49:10.400
These two hundred taels of silver

49:10.400 --> 49:11.800
You can buy two legs of a person

49:15.599 --> 49:17.039
You think it’s too little?

49:17.480 --> 49:18.559
That's easy to say

49:18.760 --> 49:19.480
You name the number

49:19.719 --> 49:20.880
I'll go clear it again

49:25.159 --> 49:26.159
this

49:26.760 --> 49:28.039
You'd better tell me the number

49:28.480 --> 49:29.280
Then

49:29.880 --> 49:30.599
three hundred taels

49:35.679 --> 49:36.960
These three hundred taels of silver

49:38.480 --> 49:39.880
Is it enough to buy your leisure?

49:40.079 --> 49:40.840
Song Dynasty History

49:41.880 --> 49:43.119
What do you mean by this?

49:46.719 --> 49:47.519
Yi Bantou

49:49.400 --> 49:51.840
I heard that since you took charge of the fast class

49:51.840 --> 49:53.280
I'm so busy

49:54.559 --> 49:55.880
Take those two rats and three wolves

49:56.039 --> 49:57.559
They all went out on the street naked.

49:58.280 --> 50:00.639
You are also this age

50:00.639 --> 50:01.800
so hard

50:01.800 --> 50:02.960
Is it your brain?

50:03.440 --> 50:04.440
I'm too busy and confused.

50:07.960 --> 50:09.800
Is this the first day you met me, Song Chen?

50:11.800 --> 50:13.320
It's also my fault for being negligent.

50:13.840 --> 50:14.599
How about this

50:16.039 --> 50:16.920
from today

50:16.920 --> 50:18.719
You don’t have to worry about the fast shift.

50:18.719 --> 50:19.840
Let me take care of it directly

50:20.480 --> 50:21.519
Farewell, Song Dianshi

50:21.880 --> 50:23.039
This is impossible

50:23.119 --> 50:24.639
You can't because of this

50:24.639 --> 50:25.920
Just save me the trouble

50:27.159 --> 50:28.480
If you think three hundred taels is less

50:28.599 --> 50:29.960
Then five hundred taels

50:32.199 --> 50:33.519
One thousand taels is enough, right?

50:35.679 --> 50:36.719
Don't give face

50:37.840 --> 50:38.440
roll

50:51.280 --> 50:52.800
Six thousand taels a year

50:52.800 --> 50:54.119
Three years and eighteen thousand

50:54.920 --> 50:56.159
Thirty thousand in five years

50:57.880 --> 50:58.719
All gone

51:00.840 --> 51:01.360
All

51:05.159 --> 51:06.159
Qu three more

51:06.519 --> 51:07.400
what are you doing

51:19.880 --> 51:22.320
I met Mother Liu, the old bustard of Yingchun Yuan

51:25.280 --> 51:26.840
She said you haven't been there for a long time

51:27.559 --> 51:28.840
Yingchunyuan

51:30.119 --> 51:31.400
What do you mean

51:32.320 --> 51:34.159
Song Dianshi asked me to ask you

51:36.119 --> 51:38.800
That new fanboy from Yingchunyuan

51:40.360 --> 51:41.800
Did I ask you to cover it?

51:44.440 --> 51:45.800
Song Dynasty History

51:46.199 --> 51:47.760
Why is he asking this?

51:49.039 --> 51:49.960
I don't know either

51:49.960 --> 51:51.239
It should be no big deal

51:51.559 --> 51:53.199
Boss Yi, just give me a message

51:55.719 --> 51:58.239
Me and their mother

51:58.480 --> 51:59.760
Said this

51:59.760 --> 52:00.639
How much is the silver package?

52:00.960 --> 52:01.920
I just said it verbally

52:01.920 --> 52:03.000
I didn't give you any money.

52:03.920 --> 52:06.679
I just said it and got it covered.

52:10.400 --> 52:12.199
Boss Yi still has face.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.039
That mother Liu complained to me

52:16.480 --> 52:18.800
Said this fan has been here for almost two months

52:18.920 --> 52:20.039
Because you guaranteed it

52:20.400 --> 52:21.960
I don’t even dare to take any other jobs.

52:22.079 --> 52:23.039
two months

52:23.559 --> 52:24.440
She's talking nonsense

52:25.039 --> 52:26.000
That fanboy

52:26.800 --> 52:27.559
At once

52:28.360 --> 52:29.599
Came here on the eighth day of the lunar month

52:29.719 --> 52:30.800
Not satisfied for a month

52:31.280 --> 52:32.159
On the day she came

52:32.159 --> 52:33.719
I went to Yingchunyuan

52:33.920 --> 52:36.119
How come you remember this day so clearly?

52:36.599 --> 52:38.400
Otherwise, Chief Secretary Zhang will be transferred

52:38.559 --> 52:40.119
I was supposed to be at Yingchunyuan that day

52:40.119 --> 52:41.360
To give him a farewell

52:41.360 --> 52:43.199
And leader Cui of the force class

52:43.440 --> 52:44.320
several civil servants

52:44.719 --> 52:46.480
There must be eight or nine people in total

52:46.920 --> 52:48.719
Why did Song Dianshi ask this?

52:50.480 --> 52:51.960
He didn't tell me and I didn't dare to ask.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.039
I guess

52:54.800 --> 52:56.599
He also has a crush on that fanboy

52:59.519 --> 53:01.480
If you want me to talk about Yi Bantou

53:02.440 --> 53:04.239
You can't compete with him

53:07.719 --> 53:08.360
Don't grab

53:09.440 --> 53:10.239
Don't dare to grab

53:13.719 --> 53:15.199
Then I will reply to Song Dianshi

53:15.199 --> 53:16.599
Just say you don’t have a bag

53:24.320 --> 53:25.599
The confession is correct.

53:26.320 --> 53:27.119
Right

53:28.559 --> 53:30.519
That mother Liu and others

53:30.519 --> 53:31.920
That's indeed what they say

53:33.800 --> 53:35.639
On the eighth day of the Lunar New Year, he stayed at Yingchun Yuan

53:36.960 --> 53:39.280
Leng Tou'er was indeed killed on the eighth day of the lunar month

53:40.039 --> 53:40.760
so

53:42.159 --> 53:43.159
He is no longer suspicious

53:44.840 --> 53:45.920
Look now

53:47.440 --> 53:48.320
No more

53:54.119 --> 53:56.480
The backers before the two rats and three wolves

53:56.639 --> 53:57.599
It's your master

53:57.960 --> 53:59.719
It is indeed Master who is restraining them

54:00.440 --> 54:01.639
After the death of Leng Captou

54:02.639 --> 54:04.159
They took refuge in Bantou Yi again

54:06.320 --> 54:07.719
The villain has also heard about it

54:07.880 --> 54:08.800
Now Yi Bantou

54:08.800 --> 54:10.440
I was exempted from the express shift job

54:13.519 --> 54:14.760
Who will they go to?

54:15.000 --> 54:16.440
I heard that in other yamen

54:16.960 --> 54:19.039
The bosses who visit and fight against the bank are all

54:20.800 --> 54:21.679
Master Dianshi

54:25.079 --> 54:27.119
They did fawn over me before

54:28.920 --> 54:30.159
But I think they are sloppy

54:30.320 --> 54:31.880
But this force

54:32.159 --> 54:33.360
It's really useful

54:37.840 --> 54:38.679
Qu three more

54:40.920 --> 54:42.199
I see you are smart in your actions

54:42.599 --> 54:44.199
And your master’s methods

54:44.199 --> 54:45.400
You should watch it for a while

54:46.880 --> 54:47.679
Not as good as this

54:48.679 --> 54:49.719
I'll be your backer

54:50.760 --> 54:51.960
How about you take charge of them?

54:56.519 --> 54:57.559
Naqu three updates

54:57.920 --> 54:59.360
Just a little catcher

55:00.079 --> 55:01.519
I'm afraid I can't protect us.

55:02.840 --> 55:04.760
We didn't expect him to protect us.

55:05.719 --> 55:06.400
But

55:06.400 --> 55:08.320
He was just used to bring down Yi.

55:11.199 --> 55:12.280
After that

55:13.079 --> 55:14.800
Who should we rely on?

55:15.880 --> 55:17.000
Song Dynasty History

55:18.559 --> 55:19.440
Song Dynasty History

55:20.199 --> 55:21.360
He doesn't accept cash either.

55:21.360 --> 55:22.639
That Song Dianshi

55:22.880 --> 55:23.719
Heavy Yin Qi

55:24.000 --> 55:25.079
He is more angry

55:25.559 --> 55:26.480
I guess so

55:26.719 --> 55:28.199
Likes to manipulate people's hearts

55:31.440 --> 55:32.639
You be my right hand

55:33.599 --> 55:35.800
As for money matters

55:37.880 --> 55:38.800
It's up to you

55:39.400 --> 55:40.800
Speaking of money matters

55:46.239 --> 55:47.519
There are quite a few villains

56:01.639 --> 56:03.239
Who else have you shown this ledger to?

56:04.679 --> 56:05.320
my master

56:05.719 --> 56:06.360
And Yi Tou'er

56:08.320 --> 56:09.679
I copied a copy and gave it to Boss Yi

56:10.440 --> 56:11.239
No wonder

56:11.800 --> 56:12.679
so

56:15.639 --> 56:16.599
You agreed

56:16.599 --> 56:17.840
The villain wants to invite Song Dianshi

56:17.840 --> 56:19.480
Promise me one thing first

56:28.880 --> 56:29.800
It's recorded in this account book

56:29.800 --> 56:31.719
Not just thousands of dollars

56:32.760 --> 56:34.719
It’s a series of evil deeds

56:36.199 --> 56:37.440
The villain wants to use this account

56:37.440 --> 56:39.159
Please vote for Song Dianshi

56:42.719 --> 56:44.039
The villain is going to take two rats and three wolves

56:44.039 --> 56:45.159
Five heads of household

56:45.840 --> 56:48.119
Let’s get rid of this visit and fight in Zhixian County.

56:55.360 --> 56:57.280
How did you know I was testing you?

57:00.159 --> 57:01.960
After all, the villain has been a policeman for several years.

57:02.800 --> 57:04.239
Testing others all day long

57:07.760 --> 57:09.239
You little catcher

57:09.960 --> 57:11.159
It's quite interesting

57:15.519 --> 57:17.280
The big boss is thick-skinned and thick-skinned

57:20.239 --> 57:22.360
Arrest him and put him on trial

57:23.360 --> 57:24.159
torture

57:25.679 --> 57:26.800
It's a happy thing

57:27.079 --> 57:28.599
Then Song Dianshi is accurate.

57:34.840 --> 57:37.280
But those five people are not easy to get.

57:37.599 --> 57:39.480
Besides, if you catch one

57:39.480 --> 57:40.679
The other four ran away

57:41.159 --> 57:43.280
Just get the five of them together.

57:43.920 --> 57:44.960
The five of them made an appointment

57:44.960 --> 57:46.280
Do you want to treat me to a drink?

57:48.519 --> 57:49.800
Why should I treat you to a drink?

57:51.360 --> 57:53.800
The idea of ​​letting Bantou Yi give money to Song Dianshi

57:54.880 --> 57:56.039
It's from a villain

58:01.000 --> 58:01.719
presumptuous

58:02.880 --> 58:04.039
You actually dare to take advantage of me

58:04.039 --> 58:04.800
Song Dynasty History

58:05.639 --> 58:06.400
Didn't you just say

58:06.400 --> 58:08.159
Do you still want me to be your right hand?

58:21.159 --> 58:21.800
take it

58:28.719 --> 58:29.599
The villain resigns

58:29.840 --> 58:30.360
roll

58:35.440 --> 58:37.880
Do review after learning

58:37.880 --> 58:39.920
It's hard to say

58:40.360 --> 58:41.679
Friends come from far away

58:41.679 --> 58:42.599
Very happy

58:42.880 --> 58:45.440
Friends come from far away

58:45.440 --> 58:47.400
Very happy

58:47.800 --> 58:48.199
People don’t

58:48.199 --> 58:49.079
Mr. Sir

58:49.599 --> 58:50.719
We have learned this

58:52.519 --> 58:53.320
learned

58:53.639 --> 58:54.239
"The Analects"

58:54.239 --> 58:56.440
The older ones among us learned it last year

58:59.440 --> 59:00.400
The teacher will test you

59:01.199 --> 59:02.320
Review the past and learn the new

59:02.320 --> 59:03.280
What's the next sentence?

59:06.119 --> 59:06.840
Hmm hmm

59:06.840 --> 59:07.880
Haven't you learned it?

59:09.360 --> 59:09.920
gentlemen

59:09.920 --> 59:10.920
Review the past and learn the new

59:10.920 --> 59:11.800
You can be a teacher

59:11.800 --> 59:13.000
This sentence means

59:13.000 --> 59:14.880
Review the old and know the new

59:14.880 --> 59:16.159
You can be a teacher

59:19.079 --> 59:20.000
As a teacher

59:20.400 --> 59:21.519
Should I remind you?

59:21.519 --> 59:22.679
Reviewing the past and learning the new

59:25.159 --> 59:25.800
continue

59:27.119 --> 59:28.639
People don’t know but are not surprised

59:28.840 --> 59:29.920
Not a gentleman

59:30.400 --> 59:32.920
People don’t know but are not surprised

59:32.920 --> 59:35.239
Not a gentleman

59:35.800 --> 59:36.679
You guys do it again

59:36.880 --> 59:39.119
Do review after learning

59:39.119 --> 59:41.199
It's hard to say

59:41.199 --> 59:44.039
Friends come from far away

59:44.039 --> 59:44.599
Very happy

59:44.599 --> 59:45.320
Don't leave after school

59:46.360 --> 59:47.719
People don’t know

59:50.159 --> 59:51.199
know why

59:51.719 --> 59:52.679
Do I want to keep you?

59:57.320 --> 59:59.599
Mr. Wang will also be detained in court, right?

01:00:00.239 --> 01:00:02.840
Mr. Wang often stays in court

01:00:03.039 --> 01:00:05.119
But he didn't keep me

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.320
Who has he kept?

01:00:07.599 --> 01:00:08.440
there's a few

01:00:10.159 --> 01:00:10.920
write down

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:12.880
good

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:22.039
Do you know why I kept you?

01:00:22.719 --> 01:00:23.519
I know

01:00:24.719 --> 01:00:25.480
you know

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:42.000
gentlemen

01:00:42.679 --> 01:00:43.679
Aren't you going to kneel down?

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.320
I kneel down

01:00:58.599 --> 01:00:59.320
gentlemen

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:00.079
Inverted

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.519
You have to turn around

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:05.239
You just

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:05.960
gentlemen

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:06.559
no

01:01:06.559 --> 01:01:07.199
so

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:08.639
gentlemen

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.239
what are you doing

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:13.599
gentlemen

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.239
Isn't it always like this for sir to be detained in jail?

01:01:16.239 --> 01:01:17.519
My uncle has always been like this

01:01:24.599 --> 01:01:26.079
My uncle told me

01:01:27.119 --> 01:01:29.199
As time went by, sir, I forgot

01:01:31.639 --> 01:01:32.679
Then let's continue

01:01:51.159 --> 01:01:51.800
gentlemen

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:53.239
Is it enough

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:57.320
Enough, enough, enough

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:01.679
Mr. that

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:03.079
can i leave

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:07.920
Is there anything else?

01:02:08.239 --> 01:02:08.840
gentlemen

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:10.760
Do you still want it?

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:11.800
No, no, no, no, no, no

01:02:12.119 --> 01:02:13.400
If there is nothing else

01:02:13.639 --> 01:02:14.400
Then don't want it

01:02:16.079 --> 01:02:18.119
Mr. Na Na, I take my leave.

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:22.000
correct

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:25.039
Have you ever mentioned this to anyone else?

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:26.360
never mentioned

01:02:26.599 --> 01:02:27.440
never mentioned

01:02:27.599 --> 01:02:29.400
I have never told my parents

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.280
Master Wang warned me

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:32.119
I said that

01:02:32.119 --> 01:02:33.559
I can't study here anymore

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:34.760
If so

01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:36.920
My dad will beat me to death

01:02:38.239 --> 01:02:39.159
who is your father

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.679
My father is a blacksmith in Liujiaji

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.519
Liujiaji in the city outside Ximen

01:02:48.239 --> 01:02:49.239
Your father is a blacksmith

01:02:49.239 --> 01:02:51.079
Why not let you help in the iron shop?

01:02:51.079 --> 01:02:52.480
But I came here to study.

01:02:52.719 --> 01:02:53.719
I have many brothers

01:02:54.119 --> 01:02:56.440
My dad said there must be someone in the family who can read.

01:02:56.679 --> 01:02:58.800
Mr. Wang won’t accept my training.

01:03:05.119 --> 01:03:06.079
Mr. farewell

01:03:12.159 --> 01:03:12.960
Mr. farewell

01:03:16.199 --> 01:03:16.840
do not move

01:03:21.199 --> 01:03:22.559
This was really beaten by that kid

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:26.719
This board is made

01:03:27.119 --> 01:03:29.119
This guy must be a yamen servant.

01:03:40.199 --> 01:03:41.119
You tell me

01:03:41.559 --> 01:03:43.519
The murderer took the headless chick

01:03:43.519 --> 01:03:45.000
When stuffed into my uncle's mouth

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:46.559
I thought

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Originally, I wanted to learn from these children

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.159
What clues were found?

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:54.559
result

01:03:54.639 --> 01:03:57.679
As a result, an even more outrageous quirk was discovered

01:04:00.519 --> 01:04:01.880
I checked my uncle's account book

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:03.119
every year

01:04:03.599 --> 01:04:04.519
have three children

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.320
They don't need to be bound to practice.

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:07.440
All poor boys

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:08.400
Home is outside the city

01:04:11.199 --> 01:04:12.519
First, good sealing

01:04:12.639 --> 01:04:14.000
Second, even if the news leaks out,

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.199
Just send him home directly

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.800
It won't spread around the city

01:04:18.679 --> 01:04:19.400
Moreover

01:04:19.679 --> 01:04:22.039
If a blacksmith's son told the blacksmith

01:04:22.199 --> 01:04:23.400
The old gentleman keeps coming back every once in a while

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:25.320
Let me beat him with a ruler

01:04:26.559 --> 01:04:28.280
The blacksmith would have thought he was crazy.

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:29.800
It's inevitable to beat him first

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:32.599
I always thought

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.719
My uncle is someone I have known all my life.

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.400
I only found out after he died

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:39.000
I seem to have never

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.280
really knew him

01:04:46.159 --> 01:04:47.840
Someone I've known my whole life

01:04:50.199 --> 01:04:52.440
But it’s like I’ve never known each other before

01:04:56.199 --> 01:04:57.960
This is a toast to my uncle

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.280
Respect the prince and his wife

01:05:13.119 --> 01:05:13.800
this cup

01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:17.679
Respect my master

01:05:20.559 --> 01:05:21.960
Jing Leng catches the head

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:34.880
this cup

01:05:37.519 --> 01:05:38.400
Here's a toast

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:42.320
Who is this toast to?

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:50.599
This is a toast to Confucius

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:52.719
Respect Confucius

01:05:53.519 --> 01:05:54.800
Respect him for thousands of years

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:56.079
Teaching people how to behave in vain

01:05:57.239 --> 01:05:58.159
Teach and teach

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:01.000
There are still so many people in this world who don’t do human things.

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:02.320
Don't speak human language

01:06:02.519 --> 01:06:04.559
A heartless beast in human skin

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:07.599
Confucius

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:09.400
Don't be angry, old man.

01:06:09.599 --> 01:06:10.960
It's not because you don't teach well

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:11.760
But because

01:06:12.679 --> 01:06:14.159
It's because of this as a human being

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.039
It's really too difficult

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:17.119
too difficult

01:06:18.079 --> 01:06:19.760
It’s really hard to say it well

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:21.320
Dry

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:21.880
Dry

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.599
My head hurts so much

01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:58.559
Just have a bowl of hangover soup

01:06:58.559 --> 01:06:59.159
Really

01:06:59.559 --> 01:07:00.199
Where

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:01.440
The one in front

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.800
The tofu and fish bream soup at the soup cake shop is the best

01:07:04.119 --> 01:07:05.079
Crossed this bridge

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:06.599
Entered that alley

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:09.719
The alley is

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.400
Zi said on the river

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:18.719
Passed away like a man

01:07:21.159 --> 01:07:22.639
Zi said on the river

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:28.199
Could it be that this is the gambler who jumped into the river?

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:31.320
The owner of the house on Rouge Lane

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:32.199
Chen Wang

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:35.239
this case

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:39.159
It must be related to the fire twenty years ago
