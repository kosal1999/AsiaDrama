=Episode 11=

01:58.319 --> 02:00.719
Outside the south gate, an old temple hidden in the forest

02:01.200 --> 02:02.640
The criminal is about to commit another crime.

02:02.840 --> 02:03.640
Go right away

02:06.920 --> 02:08.479
It seems that the criminal sent it again.

02:10.599 --> 02:12.639
The criminal is trying to use us again
to catch people.

02:12.879 --> 02:14.719
But the problem is that I don't know who I'm trying to catch this time.

02:15.719 --> 02:16.479
We do this every time

02:16.479 --> 02:18.199
Should I do what he says?

02:18.439 --> 02:19.759
The culprit is us

02:20.159 --> 02:21.599
I would have guessed that there was no clue.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.560
Even though I know I'm being used

02:23.800 --> 02:24.879
I have no choice but to chase after it

02:27.919 --> 02:29.400
Moreover, Hyeonryeong Nari also

02:29.639 --> 02:31.280
They told us to go, so we should go.

02:39.531 --> 02:41.630
(Ak's Bansinseon)

02:41.639 --> 02:42.319
wake up and see

02:48.080 --> 02:51.000
I will take care of your life and your future.

02:53.360 --> 02:54.080
You...

02:58.840 --> 02:59.719
It's me

03:00.080 --> 03:01.520
Don’t you already know it’s me?

03:01.520 --> 03:02.439
What are you doing here?

03:02.879 --> 03:04.039
What is that beard again?

03:04.199 --> 03:05.280
Didn't you have a beard before?

03:05.840 --> 03:07.080
The beard is attached

03:07.520 --> 03:08.479
Take it off to check.

03:09.319 --> 03:10.639
How come you haven't been here for so long?

03:12.319 --> 03:13.919
20 years have passed

03:13.919 --> 03:15.560
Our appearance would have changed a lot too.

03:15.879 --> 03:17.520
How did I find out?

03:17.840 --> 03:20.800
You know it when you see the naked eyebrows of your hometown

03:22.759 --> 03:24.919
Did you find out just by looking at that?

03:25.280 --> 03:27.039
Actually, I wasn't sure either.

03:27.039 --> 03:28.080
But I didn't even try

03:28.439 --> 03:29.639
How can I solve my problem?

03:30.800 --> 03:32.000
For what reason did I come looking for you?

03:32.560 --> 03:33.319
first of all

03:33.719 --> 03:35.039
I called you to make sure it was you.

03:35.800 --> 03:36.319
and

03:36.719 --> 03:38.360
I called you here to resolve the issue.

03:41.039 --> 03:42.960
Aren't you trying to exchange my life for money?

03:43.960 --> 03:44.879
Did you get caught?

03:45.960 --> 03:47.199
If so, how much will you give me?

03:49.000 --> 03:50.599
Why should I give you money?

03:51.159 --> 03:52.080
I have to pay hush money

03:52.639 --> 03:53.280
If you don't pay

03:53.360 --> 03:54.560
Because I will spread the word

03:56.639 --> 03:58.879
What good is spreading rumors?

03:59.479 --> 04:01.639
Everyone thinks you're crazy

04:03.000 --> 04:04.240
Otherwise, I'll tell that crazy genius.

04:04.560 --> 04:06.360
He
promised to give me a thousand pieces of silver.

04:07.240 --> 04:08.120
If you are him

04:08.639 --> 04:09.840
Would you believe it?

04:13.280 --> 04:14.639
Aren't you afraid of me?

04:16.759 --> 04:18.079
Shouldn't you be afraid of me?

04:19.600 --> 04:21.319
lately

04:21.319 --> 04:23.439
Haven't you heard that there was a murder in the castle
?

04:24.519 --> 04:25.720
You killed them all?

04:27.120 --> 04:28.040
No way

04:28.560 --> 04:29.240
I don't believe it

04:29.959 --> 04:30.800
Of course me too

04:30.800 --> 04:31.639
20 years ago

04:31.639 --> 04:33.000
what happened

04:33.000 --> 04:34.720
where were you

04:34.720 --> 04:35.839
I don't know why they changed their name

04:36.399 --> 04:37.000
Sore

04:37.439 --> 04:38.759
You couldn't have killed someone.

04:39.120 --> 04:40.079
never

04:41.000 --> 04:42.279
Are you so sure?

04:42.279 --> 04:43.199
of course

04:43.199 --> 04:45.000
Have you forgotten that I know how to use physiognomy?

04:45.879 --> 04:47.879
Besides, aren’t we friends?

04:48.639 --> 04:49.720
Friends?

04:49.720 --> 04:51.439
father

04:56.639 --> 04:57.120
but

04:57.120 --> 04:58.199
father

04:58.199 --> 04:59.319
We are friends

05:00.199 --> 05:01.839
Then you are a friend

05:01.839 --> 05:03.879
I'll show you how to betray me

05:05.920 --> 05:07.680
How can you tell me how to betray you ?

05:08.639 --> 05:10.600
I feel so sorry for you

05:10.600 --> 05:11.800
You're trying to help.

05:13.519 --> 05:15.360
Do you know any giants?

05:15.508 --> 05:22.022
(Ak's Bansinseon)

05:26.879 --> 05:29.199
Looks like that fortune teller is waiting for a friend again.

05:29.199 --> 05:31.199
Maybe catch that person’s friend today?

05:33.720 --> 05:34.439
someone came

05:34.959 --> 05:37.439
That person's friend
is Deacon Jang of the Seol family?

05:38.360 --> 05:39.519
Doesn't that make sense?

05:40.160 --> 05:40.879
Who are you?

05:42.680 --> 05:43.720
bump

05:44.199 --> 05:46.000
Are you a bad teacher?

05:46.480 --> 05:47.519
Are you a giant?

05:47.759 --> 05:50.079
I am the butler of the giant's mansion.

05:50.240 --> 05:51.720
Although you did not come

05:52.120 --> 05:53.600
I brought you gold

05:54.680 --> 05:56.480
Well, I'll have to check it out.

05:56.920 --> 05:57.680
Anyway

06:09.759 --> 06:11.199
You will never fool me.

06:11.199 --> 06:13.000
I too was once a master.

06:13.519 --> 06:14.680
I've seen gold

06:16.079 --> 06:16.839
tell me

06:17.920 --> 06:19.319
what do you know

06:20.040 --> 06:21.439
What are those people doing?

06:21.439 --> 06:22.680
Looks like a gold bar?

06:23.959 --> 06:26.319
The fortune telling teacher uses information from friends.

06:26.319 --> 06:27.519
I'm thinking of selling it to the giant.

06:27.519 --> 06:28.120
Let's go

06:45.199 --> 06:46.160
What are you doing now?

06:47.839 --> 06:49.240
The information you want
is hidden in the donkey's body.

06:49.240 --> 06:50.839
I wrote it down on a piece of paper under the saddle

06:50.839 --> 06:51.399
Quickly chase after me

06:51.720 --> 06:52.759
I don't think so.

06:53.560 --> 06:54.560
While I was chasing the donkey

06:55.040 --> 06:56.240
You're going to run away with the gold.

06:56.639 --> 06:57.839
When I get the information

06:57.839 --> 06:58.720
I'm afraid it will work against you.

06:59.279 --> 07:00.319
How come you're still not chasing me?

07:00.480 --> 07:01.519
How come you don't run away?

07:04.079 --> 07:06.399
The criminal told us to catch Deacon Jang.

07:08.439 --> 07:09.560
Why would I chase a donkey?

07:10.360 --> 07:12.120
You must be slower than a donkey.

07:12.519 --> 07:13.160
tell me

07:13.160 --> 07:14.120
what you know

07:14.120 --> 07:15.439
tell me everything

07:15.519 --> 07:16.120
catch it

07:25.240 --> 07:26.120
don't come close

07:26.639 --> 07:27.680
Because if he comes, I'll kill this guy.

07:27.680 --> 07:28.839
Is it important to catch the criminal?

07:29.279 --> 07:29.879
Come on!

08:32.080 --> 08:32.879
Scatter up and follow them!

08:55.919 --> 08:56.879
Are you okay?

08:59.919 --> 09:00.639
it's okay

09:01.320 --> 09:02.279
It's just lime

09:02.960 --> 09:04.799
The commendation he used
was made of ceramics.

09:04.799 --> 09:05.519
ceramic?

09:06.480 --> 09:07.440
Inside the hollow ceramic commendation

09:07.799 --> 09:08.960
They added lime.

09:09.440 --> 09:10.000
Sore

09:10.759 --> 09:12.600
It didn't seem like they were trying to take our lives .

09:13.559 --> 09:14.919
The injuries our children suffered

09:15.679 --> 09:16.559
Not all injuries were fatal

09:18.120 --> 09:19.120
What happened to that fortune telling teacher?

09:20.320 --> 09:21.240
I took advantage of the confusion and ran away.

09:21.639 --> 09:23.039
Even though we searched the area for half a day,

09:23.600 --> 09:24.399
Couldn't find it

09:28.080 --> 09:28.919
It looks like the culprit

09:28.919 --> 09:30.639
This time, the person who told us to catch him

09:31.840 --> 09:32.960
I don't think it's him

09:33.759 --> 09:34.840
The letter he sent last time was

09:35.840 --> 09:37.440
Tell us to catch our bullies

09:37.759 --> 09:38.679
If it meant confining me to a castle,

09:39.320 --> 09:40.159
Maybe this time

09:41.399 --> 09:43.200
It probably means that we should catch Deacon Jang.

09:45.720 --> 09:47.120
He creates opportunities

09:47.279 --> 09:48.840
I'm thinking of killing Jang Gye-jo.

09:49.480 --> 09:52.080
Is the government trying to use a spy?

09:52.080 --> 09:52.960
That's probably not it

09:53.279 --> 09:55.840
First of all , there are a lot of people in government offices, so it is easy to make mistakes.

09:56.639 --> 09:57.399
also

09:57.960 --> 09:58.919
Even if it kills me

09:59.039 --> 10:00.240
whatever he wants

10:00.240 --> 10:02.480
'Cause you can't hang up the body

10:02.559 --> 10:04.120
So how can this be an opportunity?

10:04.440 --> 10:06.639
It's an opportunity, because Jang Gye-jo has become a loner.

10:07.039 --> 10:09.240
Because you tried to use me

10:13.200 --> 10:14.360
Let's talk again then

10:15.440 --> 10:16.200
i really

10:17.559 --> 10:19.120
'Cause no one knows if they'll help him

10:20.960 --> 10:21.720
Seol Hyo-ryeom

10:22.080 --> 10:23.720
The wise man, Nari, is unwell.

10:23.720 --> 10:24.960
I will take your place

10:25.240 --> 10:26.240
Please tell me I ask for your understanding.

10:26.679 --> 10:27.679
no

10:28.840 --> 10:30.600
Just because Warrior Song himself came

10:30.840 --> 10:33.120
It's like saving my face.

10:33.639 --> 10:35.240
Well, today

10:35.960 --> 10:37.080
What brought you here?

10:38.039 --> 10:39.519
I will tell you bluntly.

10:40.279 --> 10:40.960
yesternight

10:41.720 --> 10:45.159
They say the government office caught my butler, Jang Gye-jo .

10:45.600 --> 10:47.840
What crime did he commit?

10:48.200 --> 10:49.159
I tried to harm someone with a sword.

10:49.960 --> 10:51.159
To whom?

10:51.639 --> 10:53.159
The fortune telling teacher is evil Cheolchwi.

10:54.440 --> 10:56.679
Is the fisherman dead or injured?

10:56.960 --> 10:58.840
Fortunately, the police arrived on time.

10:58.840 --> 11:00.559
I stopped Jang Gye-jo from harming people.

11:02.399 --> 11:05.080
That means you're safe.

11:05.919 --> 11:07.720
But you hurt two of my police officers with a knife.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.840
His gang
injured three people with throwing stars.

11:11.440 --> 11:12.720
That is, five people working at the government office

11:13.519 --> 11:14.960
You're saying you got hurt because of our butler.

11:15.480 --> 11:18.279
Otherwise, I spent my silver money.

11:18.480 --> 11:19.600
I guess I should give it as a consolation prize.

11:19.759 --> 11:21.080
I

11:23.440 --> 11:24.480
Instead, thank you

11:24.960 --> 11:27.840
This incident is not serious either.

11:28.279 --> 11:29.960
pay a deposit

11:30.399 --> 11:31.360
I want to save the butler.

11:31.679 --> 11:33.080
When you review the case

11:34.320 --> 11:35.919
Come to my house and tell him

11:36.840 --> 11:38.080
I guarantee it

11:38.600 --> 11:40.960
I will definitely run when you call me

11:44.159 --> 11:45.279
Warrior Song

11:45.279 --> 11:47.559
Can you do me a favor?

11:48.480 --> 11:50.559
What did Jang Gye-jo do last night?

11:50.559 --> 11:53.039
It's related to a serial murder case.

11:53.320 --> 11:55.840
Moreover, he threatened Ak Cheolchwi with a sword.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.600
The police saw it clearly.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.960
Moreover, he disobeyed arrest and
injured government officials.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.960
Isn’t everything a serious sin?

12:02.960 --> 12:04.399
I'm going to invade your mansion

12:04.399 --> 12:05.519
Just because I didn't catch his gang

12:05.519 --> 12:07.720
I think I was kind to you.

12:10.720 --> 12:11.679
get a guarantee

12:14.200 --> 12:15.639
Postponing the interrogation

12:18.080 --> 12:19.960
A warrior like me

12:19.960 --> 12:21.399
I don't think it's up to you to decide.

12:21.759 --> 12:22.440
what

12:24.519 --> 12:25.600
If you really want to

12:26.799 --> 12:29.559
I'll just go now

12:30.159 --> 12:31.159
I'm busy with official duties

12:32.879 --> 12:33.840
Please understand that I cannot see you off far away.

12:39.919 --> 12:40.840
Warrior Song

12:42.440 --> 12:44.559
When the prefectural government deliberates on the agenda

12:45.440 --> 12:48.919
I will also leave that place.

12:49.399 --> 12:52.480
If there is evidence and a complainant,

12:52.679 --> 12:54.840
Execute the sentence on the spot

12:54.960 --> 12:56.720
Even if you beat Jang Gye-jo to death

12:56.840 --> 12:59.080
I won't have anything to say

13:02.879 --> 13:05.720
However, even the county commander, Nari, did not go to war.

13:06.399 --> 13:09.440
If you personally execute a sentence and
torture it to obtain a confession,

13:10.120 --> 13:14.039
I will never be able to follow

13:23.879 --> 13:24.840
me too

13:26.879 --> 13:27.960
There is a fountain like that

13:44.799 --> 13:45.639
song warrior

13:54.960 --> 13:56.159
Now that things have come to this, let's release it.

14:00.120 --> 14:00.799
Do you really want to release me?

14:01.519 --> 14:03.600
I heard it all from behind the folding screen

14:03.840 --> 14:05.200
Isn’t that guy right?

14:05.799 --> 14:08.000
There is no accuser and no testimony.

14:08.200 --> 14:09.639
What should I do with the trial?

14:11.399 --> 14:12.480
Let go

14:17.200 --> 14:17.879
All right

14:20.320 --> 14:21.320
I'll release it today

14:58.840 --> 14:59.639
Samgyeong-ah

15:04.120 --> 15:04.879
Samgyeong-ah

15:11.679 --> 15:12.600
I caught the donkey

15:15.000 --> 15:16.679
Did I tell you? We have to spread out and search

15:17.240 --> 15:17.960
how is it?

15:20.080 --> 15:20.759
No?

15:21.399 --> 15:22.080
doesn't exist

15:27.120 --> 15:28.639
That fortune telling teacher is so cunning.

15:29.360 --> 15:30.200
What about the donkey?

15:31.720 --> 15:32.840
Let's take him to the government office.

15:33.639 --> 15:34.600
Is it physical evidence?

15:47.840 --> 15:48.600
Warrior Song

15:49.679 --> 15:50.480
What do you want me to say?

15:50.480 --> 15:52.519
For what reason did you threaten Akcheolchwi with a sword?

15:53.039 --> 15:54.080
I was just kidding.

15:55.799 --> 15:57.240
If you don't believe it, come find him

15:57.480 --> 15:58.399
Shouldn't you just ask?

15:58.679 --> 16:00.279
You really like pranks.

16:02.200 --> 16:02.840
noha

16:04.759 --> 16:05.799
a few days ago

16:07.279 --> 16:08.440
We discussed punishment, right?

16:09.399 --> 16:11.879
The punishment of lightning in Gyeongseong

16:12.679 --> 16:14.519
I heard it’s very different from a government office?

16:14.679 --> 16:15.320
yes

16:15.759 --> 16:17.159
Even if you just look at the three fires,

16:17.559 --> 16:18.799
Everyone had different opinions.

16:19.759 --> 16:21.120
Which is scarier?

16:21.240 --> 16:22.159
When a small person sees

16:22.919 --> 16:25.039
I think the government office is scarier.

16:26.679 --> 16:27.759
I heard it's not like that for everyone?

16:28.320 --> 16:29.399
when i see

16:29.639 --> 16:31.879
It seems like the punishment of Gyeongseong Cheonrae is more scary.

16:32.240 --> 16:35.159
Little people have different opinions

16:35.159 --> 16:37.360
If so, we

16:37.960 --> 16:39.519
How about trying it with Deacon Jang?

16:39.519 --> 16:42.240
Isn't that... a bit odd?

16:42.600 --> 16:43.600
Is this a joke?

17:01.919 --> 17:02.799
lily

17:04.240 --> 17:05.960
Let's do a favor.

17:06.160 --> 17:07.839
Could you please send a message to the Seol Giant
?

17:08.480 --> 17:09.759
Since I came out

17:09.920 --> 17:11.079
Come pick me up

17:11.920 --> 17:14.160
My family's elders will give me a big reward.

17:14.720 --> 17:15.359
Can not be done

17:16.039 --> 17:17.640
Warrior Song gave a solemn warning.

17:17.880 --> 17:19.319
They said I had to go back alone.

17:19.319 --> 17:20.599
You can never send a message

17:20.599 --> 17:21.920
Think of it as exercise

17:51.799 --> 17:54.559
The culprit
is said to be a giant who will come to bail the person out.

17:54.559 --> 17:56.359
Because I can’t keep Jang Gye-jo locked up.

17:56.359 --> 17:57.400
He must have known that he would definitely be released.

17:57.559 --> 17:59.640
So on the way

17:59.640 --> 18:00.720
They must have kidnapped Jang Gye-jo.

18:01.119 --> 18:03.200
Otherwise, send agile police officers
to follow behind.

18:03.960 --> 18:05.359
How about taking the opportunity to catch the culprit?

18:05.359 --> 18:06.079
It doesn't work

18:07.359 --> 18:08.240
don't forget

18:09.240 --> 18:10.000
To the government office

18:10.839 --> 18:12.119
There is someone who knows the culprit

18:13.720 --> 18:16.839
Besides, the criminal is quick-witted.

18:17.079 --> 18:18.000
If there are a lot of people

18:19.119 --> 18:20.319
You will definitely notice

18:20.319 --> 18:20.920
All right

18:21.119 --> 18:22.200
Otherwise, I will follow alone.

18:31.119 --> 18:32.079
Are you hurt?

18:32.400 --> 18:33.079
I wasn't hurt

18:33.359 --> 18:34.359
You couldn't even hit me

18:34.640 --> 18:35.519
I am...

18:35.880 --> 18:37.559
Just because I was surprised

18:37.559 --> 18:38.839
I just fell off the roof

18:43.319 --> 18:44.400
As expected, I got hit again

18:44.599 --> 18:45.880
Even see through my ruse

18:45.880 --> 18:46.960
Counterattacking?

18:48.880 --> 18:51.000
I got rid of Jang Gye-jo's martial arts for no reason.

19:02.200 --> 19:03.200
I can't even serve people.

19:06.319 --> 19:07.319
How can you serve a ghost?

19:09.480 --> 19:10.480
Three Views

19:10.960 --> 19:12.200
What does that mean?

19:12.519 --> 19:14.559
(How can you serve a ghost?)
The culprit is Jang Gye-jo

19:14.799 --> 19:16.480
Or that Jang-gwi at that time

19:18.119 --> 19:19.279
The master who served

19:21.400 --> 19:22.559
I want to say it's a demon

19:24.759 --> 19:25.640
Brother Death Gun

19:27.039 --> 19:28.400
Brother Samkyung
tricked Brother Death Gun.

19:30.519 --> 19:31.920
How can you say Samgyeong deceived me?

19:32.279 --> 19:35.000
The information that the fortune telling teacher hid in the donkey’s body

19:36.279 --> 19:38.079
The mutt probably already got it

19:38.960 --> 19:39.920
Samgyeong brother used to be

19:39.920 --> 19:42.160
Every day, I came to my house to
chop firewood and draw water.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.920
These days, my face hasn't even been shown.

19:45.119 --> 19:47.039
He must be hiding something.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.480
Although I speak less these days

19:50.039 --> 19:51.519
What is the reason for deceiving us?

19:51.920 --> 19:54.000
If, as the fortune telling teacher says,

19:54.359 --> 19:56.960
If there was anyone who survived the fire at that time

19:57.559 --> 19:58.359
That person

19:58.839 --> 20:00.279
Must be the culprit

20:00.759 --> 20:02.079
Do you need to hide it?

20:02.079 --> 20:03.119
I just need to fix it

20:03.720 --> 20:04.799
If so, that person

20:05.000 --> 20:06.319
What if it’s someone you can’t catch?

20:07.839 --> 20:08.920
We can't catch it?

20:10.039 --> 20:11.599
If so, that person

20:12.799 --> 20:13.680
What if it's a Song warrior?

20:16.839 --> 20:17.680
That can't be possible

20:18.359 --> 20:19.279
Why not?

20:19.279 --> 20:20.440
What is the reason for doing it?

20:21.000 --> 20:22.240
I said I saw the document.

20:22.839 --> 20:25.440
You said there was a master in the Yuk family, right?

20:25.720 --> 20:27.519
Yeah, it's bad luck

20:27.839 --> 20:29.240
But they said he died in a fire.

20:29.400 --> 20:30.519
It must have been burned so its original appearance
could not be found at all.

20:30.519 --> 20:32.119
How would we know who it was?

20:32.240 --> 20:32.960
furthermore

20:33.519 --> 20:34.599
If that person is alive

20:35.119 --> 20:37.359
Isn’t he similar in age to Warrior Song?

20:41.359 --> 20:42.440
He said the guy was lame.

20:42.680 --> 20:43.519
How can a cripple kill someone?

20:43.519 --> 20:45.079
You can pretend to be lame

20:45.079 --> 20:46.920
Even murder can have an accomplice.

20:47.920 --> 20:48.839
Brother Bong

20:50.359 --> 20:52.119
Are you really doubting Warrior Song?

20:53.240 --> 20:54.480
It's just a metaphor

20:57.119 --> 20:57.839
But...

20:58.559 --> 20:59.839
But someone

21:00.559 --> 21:02.960
You know our every move.

21:03.839 --> 21:05.200
For example, Song warrior

21:05.960 --> 21:07.599
The mutt
is trying to stop the song from flowing into the warrior's ears.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.839
Lim Hunting was also killed.

21:10.440 --> 21:11.440
Samgyeong brother

21:11.759 --> 21:13.680
I don't want us to be hunted down

21:13.839 --> 21:15.519
I must have hidden it.

21:15.839 --> 21:17.839
What on earth are you trying to do?

21:19.119 --> 21:20.880
The mutt is probably

21:20.880 --> 21:23.200
You're taking risks alone.

21:23.330 --> 21:25.611
(energy)

21:34.720 --> 21:35.480
(Master)

21:36.440 --> 21:38.480
(You said it's a long way to achieve justice, right?)

21:38.960 --> 21:40.200
(I finally found out about it)

21:40.720 --> 21:42.480
(Justice is not a long way away)

21:43.200 --> 21:44.039
(Justice achieved)

21:44.039 --> 21:45.400
(government office)

21:45.400 --> 21:46.680
(There are several paths)

21:51.799 --> 21:52.480
mutt

21:53.960 --> 21:54.720
country chicken

21:56.480 --> 21:57.440
What's going on here?

21:58.279 --> 21:59.240
Well, just

21:59.240 --> 22:00.240
snow giant

22:00.240 --> 22:01.640
To see if they will buy my painting

22:02.960 --> 22:03.839
Aren't you going in?

22:11.880 --> 22:12.839
Are you following my footsteps?

22:13.240 --> 22:14.240
Is that so?

22:16.480 --> 22:17.960
It's only one test

22:18.240 --> 22:19.480
How did you know I was here?

22:20.279 --> 22:21.519
Are you trying to join hands with the snow giant?

22:25.160 --> 22:26.160
I have no other way

22:26.799 --> 22:28.200
that person is a bad person

22:28.680 --> 22:29.720
A person who has committed all kinds of evil deeds.

22:30.119 --> 22:31.880
Are you doing this knowing that?

22:31.880 --> 22:33.079
you are a police officer

22:33.079 --> 22:34.759
I did everything a police officer should do.

22:35.359 --> 22:36.000
So now

22:37.079 --> 22:38.759
To do something I shouldn't do

22:43.559 --> 22:44.839
After Master passed away

22:45.359 --> 22:46.079
you changed

22:46.480 --> 22:47.119
In the past

22:47.799 --> 22:49.200
Because he’s a mutt with a tight front and back

22:49.960 --> 22:51.599
If you're upset, run and bite

22:51.640 --> 22:52.720
You used to bark

22:55.960 --> 22:56.960
that

22:59.000 --> 23:01.240
It's because I had a back in the past.

23:01.440 --> 23:04.240
You are starting to resemble your teacher more and more now.

23:06.359 --> 23:07.440
If Master knows

23:07.440 --> 23:08.519
I don't know if you'll be happy

23:13.480 --> 23:14.720
I can't let you in

23:15.480 --> 23:16.160
country chicken

23:17.960 --> 23:19.079
I don't want to argue with you

23:20.480 --> 23:21.559
If you interfere

23:22.200 --> 23:23.640
Grab you first

23:24.400 --> 23:26.119
I'll lock you in the government office for half a day.

23:26.480 --> 23:28.359
And then I'll do my thing

23:41.279 --> 23:43.160
You killed Lim Hunting, right?

23:45.519 --> 23:47.240
Why would I kill Lim Hunting?

23:48.240 --> 23:50.279
Rather than asking the reason

23:50.720 --> 23:52.079
How can a single Bae-dong

23:52.079 --> 23:54.039
Inheriting such a big business

23:54.039 --> 23:55.279
suddenly

23:55.680 --> 23:57.359
We have to ask whether he has become a giant.

23:57.480 --> 23:58.799
Are you talking about me?

23:59.160 --> 24:01.960
20 years ago, the Yuk family disappeared due to a fire.

24:02.400 --> 24:04.440
After that, the Yuk family's gold and silver treasures and

24:04.519 --> 24:05.599
affiliated store

24:05.599 --> 24:06.720
And to the mansion

24:06.720 --> 24:08.000
Who took over?

24:08.000 --> 24:09.759
don't ask me that

24:10.720 --> 24:12.160
I'll have to look for it at the government office.

24:12.799 --> 24:13.960
Not in the government office

24:15.480 --> 24:16.720
It's there somewhere else

24:17.480 --> 24:18.720
looking at me

24:20.119 --> 24:21.440
I'm so clumsy

24:23.440 --> 24:25.559
The store's sign and name are

24:25.559 --> 24:26.359
can change

24:27.000 --> 24:29.039
worker, owner

24:29.400 --> 24:31.079
Even accounting teachers can change, but

24:31.680 --> 24:33.559
Transaction details of the payment store

24:33.559 --> 24:34.920
Few people can change

24:35.039 --> 24:36.640
I only went to 3 payment stores.

24:37.359 --> 24:39.400
There are a dozen store owners.

24:40.119 --> 24:42.000
The previous owner was Yuk Won-pok.

24:42.359 --> 24:44.119
After Yuk Won-pok died, Yuk Geun-shin

24:44.119 --> 24:45.440
After a fire broke out in the Yuk family

24:45.440 --> 24:47.400
I held the sixth position for three years.

24:49.240 --> 24:50.319
Those three years

24:50.799 --> 24:52.079
Yukjik is not Duhyeon

24:52.440 --> 24:53.640
It was at Jonghyun.

24:53.920 --> 24:55.599
In the ledger every time

24:55.599 --> 24:58.079
It had the seal of Jonghyun’s store on it.

24:58.160 --> 24:59.279
Well, what will happen three years later?

25:01.240 --> 25:02.599
They all changed to Seol’s last name.

25:08.559 --> 25:10.920
Even if I took control of the Yuk family store,

25:11.839 --> 25:12.920
What's the problem?

25:13.319 --> 25:15.279
Doesn’t Seol Giant not only have the Yuk family’s store
?

25:15.559 --> 25:17.359
He is also the owner of Chuhwaru.

25:18.680 --> 25:20.319
I don't have many stores

25:20.559 --> 25:21.920
King Muryujae’s teacher

25:22.400 --> 25:23.759
Good at calligraphy and seal engraving

25:24.440 --> 25:25.319
I heard it from my nephew

25:25.319 --> 25:27.440
He said he could imitate many different handwritings.

25:27.759 --> 25:29.079
Representative Jeong of the name

25:29.079 --> 25:30.759
I was always looking after the sick of the six atomic bombs.

25:32.559 --> 25:33.759
you

25:33.759 --> 25:35.160
Forging a will or document

25:35.599 --> 25:36.799
He poisoned Yuk Won Bomb.

25:36.799 --> 25:39.480
Set a fire and kill the Yuk family.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.079
I felt like that property had been taken away.

25:47.440 --> 25:50.079
Isn’t that a deadly sin?

25:50.920 --> 25:52.640
To commit such a crime

25:53.200 --> 25:55.079
There must also be an accomplice.

25:55.599 --> 25:58.640
Even in government offices

25:59.880 --> 26:01.640
Shouldn't there be an accomplice?

26:03.240 --> 26:04.119
That person

26:05.640 --> 26:07.559
I don't know if I found it

26:14.359 --> 26:15.240
He was my teacher.

26:18.359 --> 26:19.640
Your teacher?

26:20.480 --> 26:22.240
They put a condition on giving Lim Hunting freedom.

26:22.240 --> 26:23.480
Conciliate my teacher

26:25.119 --> 26:26.720
Master told me to stop the fire.

26:27.319 --> 26:29.920
It's not enough to have them determine that the accident was caused by a flammable substance.

26:30.920 --> 26:32.160
Also, the documents of the government office

26:32.160 --> 26:34.039
Didn’t you let them handle it?

26:34.599 --> 26:35.880
After your master died

26:36.400 --> 26:38.119
That fact

26:38.119 --> 26:39.680
I wonder if Lim Hunting knows too

26:39.920 --> 26:40.720
me again

26:41.400 --> 26:44.279
By means of serial murder

26:44.640 --> 26:46.160
Imhunting is also killed

26:47.640 --> 26:48.559
Prevent secrets from being revealed

26:50.839 --> 26:51.599
Is this what you mean?

26:53.000 --> 26:54.559
You can't manage it.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.279
A storyteller suits you

26:58.960 --> 27:00.720
The story we have just put together

27:00.880 --> 27:04.240
If you did it at a tea shop, you would have won quite a few awards.

27:04.599 --> 27:06.079
But are you going to catch me?

27:07.920 --> 27:09.240
Aside from catching me

27:10.599 --> 27:12.319
Just this action today

27:12.519 --> 27:15.519
I
will have the government strip you of your position.

27:16.839 --> 27:18.799
I can make you hit 10 sticks.

27:22.440 --> 27:23.160
six jobs

27:23.720 --> 27:26.039
There's something you need to know

27:26.440 --> 27:28.559
Today I didn't come to ask for your sins

27:29.240 --> 27:30.079
just

27:34.079 --> 27:35.480
I'm here to make a deal

27:43.240 --> 27:44.160
madam

27:45.720 --> 27:46.720
Are you a stepchild?

27:47.000 --> 27:48.119
yes, it's me

27:48.119 --> 27:49.400
I came to look for my brother Samgyeong.

27:49.960 --> 27:51.359
Samgyeong went to the government office.

27:51.519 --> 27:53.920
When I get back, I'll ask you to go to your house.

28:01.079 --> 28:02.319
here

28:03.200 --> 28:04.279
I'll wait until you come

28:07.400 --> 28:09.240
I know who the serial killer is

28:10.799 --> 28:12.480
Your butler Jang Gye-jo

28:12.880 --> 28:14.680
From the fortune telling teacher

28:14.680 --> 28:15.960
Items not received

28:16.240 --> 28:17.319
I got it

28:23.759 --> 28:24.559
How much will it cost?

28:24.559 --> 28:25.279
It's priceless.

28:27.480 --> 28:28.920
If I tell you who that person is

28:30.200 --> 28:31.160
you just

28:32.240 --> 28:33.640
Please kill him instead.

28:34.079 --> 28:37.039
If so, do you know who the culprit is?

28:37.440 --> 28:39.000
Do you remember the six disadvantages?

28:41.960 --> 28:43.359
Six poor?

29:00.440 --> 29:01.200
Pyeong-a

29:01.200 --> 29:02.440
Brother, be careful.

29:08.200 --> 29:08.880
young master

29:09.839 --> 29:10.400
young master

29:12.640 --> 29:13.480
Are you okay?

29:13.960 --> 29:14.559
be careful

29:15.559 --> 29:16.039
ruler

29:17.240 --> 29:18.480
Pyeong-ya, don’t cry.

29:18.759 --> 29:20.160
My brother has already
sent the bird home.

29:20.400 --> 29:22.119
You wanted the bird to go home, right?

29:22.279 --> 29:24.799
Has the bird come home?

29:25.559 --> 29:26.920
Pyeong-ya, there’s nothing to be afraid of.

29:27.359 --> 29:28.079
Look at this

29:28.480 --> 29:30.359
My brother had me lay down straw in advance.

29:30.559 --> 29:31.720
It's fluffy

29:31.839 --> 29:32.799
It doesn't hurt at all

29:35.720 --> 29:36.440
It doesn't hurt at all

29:38.039 --> 29:38.799
Come on, it's plain.

29:47.359 --> 29:48.759
Haven’t we been here for a long time?

29:50.279 --> 29:51.640
It's been a while

29:52.039 --> 29:53.400
The second oldest person who came to your house

29:53.400 --> 29:54.640
I used to go to Chuhwaru often.

29:54.640 --> 29:55.720
He is bright

29:57.400 --> 29:58.440
Our noble family and personality

29:58.440 --> 29:59.440
It's the complete opposite

30:06.640 --> 30:07.559
let's go now

30:07.559 --> 30:08.680
Don't get caught

30:10.559 --> 30:11.400
why?

30:11.400 --> 30:12.680
Those kids

30:12.680 --> 30:14.319
They are all students who go to a private school to study writing.

30:14.319 --> 30:15.400
That kid in front

30:17.200 --> 30:18.720
He is the son of the silk store vice president and chairman.

30:19.920 --> 30:21.640
When you call a gisaeng to your house every day and invite guests

30:21.640 --> 30:22.519
When I go to call a gisaeng

30:25.319 --> 30:26.319
I got hit once then

30:27.480 --> 30:28.599
So it's better not to run into each other

30:28.759 --> 30:29.400
let's go

30:32.319 --> 30:34.440
I will kill everyone, leaving no one behind.

30:34.720 --> 30:35.279
boom

30:35.279 --> 30:36.079
The kids are here

30:37.200 --> 30:37.960
boom

30:40.160 --> 30:41.759
This is the declaration of war you gave me.

30:42.279 --> 30:43.720
I took General Dongdu with me

30:43.720 --> 30:44.759
I'm here to fight

30:45.359 --> 30:47.759
Isn’t that kid your master?

30:49.440 --> 30:50.039
that's right

30:50.640 --> 30:51.359
boom

30:51.519 --> 30:53.920
All four generals were bitten and died.

30:54.039 --> 30:55.440
Do you have any more competitions?

30:55.440 --> 30:56.319
The person next to you, Mr.

30:56.319 --> 30:58.559
I think the second master of the grain store is evil.

30:59.920 --> 31:01.839
Yukbulwu, evil road

31:02.200 --> 31:03.279
Don't be puffed up

31:03.440 --> 31:05.359
I recently took on a warrior again.

31:05.440 --> 31:07.559
Wonpae, Woo Moon Seong-do, Bae Won-kyung

31:07.799 --> 31:09.200
These are all kids under me.

31:09.599 --> 31:11.440
So it doesn’t matter whether you are Dongdu or Cheoldu.

31:11.440 --> 31:14.480
It's nothing to me

31:17.119 --> 31:18.240
I was surprised

31:18.880 --> 31:19.920
you shut your mouth

31:20.240 --> 31:21.400
They say it well

31:21.720 --> 31:24.039
Are we going to play cricket later?

31:24.599 --> 31:25.920
Or are you competing?

31:25.920 --> 31:27.240
There are so many useless words

31:27.519 --> 31:28.799
Let's get started quickly

31:35.119 --> 31:39.720
- ask
- ask

31:39.720 --> 31:41.559
Don't stay there, keep asking

31:41.880 --> 31:43.319
bite

31:43.319 --> 31:44.319
I can't stand it

31:44.319 --> 31:45.039
I'll come see Sophie.

31:45.039 --> 31:46.359
Kill General Dongdu

31:46.359 --> 31:47.079
General Dongdu

31:58.559 --> 32:00.640
- Ask quickly
- Ask

32:00.640 --> 32:02.319
- ask
- ask

32:02.319 --> 32:04.400
- Ask
- General Dongdu

32:04.400 --> 32:05.720
Ask quickly

32:05.880 --> 32:06.640
cheer up

32:06.640 --> 32:07.880
- ask
- ask

32:08.319 --> 32:09.039
bite and kill

32:10.160 --> 32:12.200
Where did you get this chicken?

32:12.200 --> 32:13.799
my cricket

32:13.799 --> 32:15.440
became food for chickens

32:15.799 --> 32:17.480
the chicken didn't eat

32:20.039 --> 32:20.960
General Dongdu

32:21.720 --> 32:23.480
was here

32:23.480 --> 32:24.440
What should I do because I’m sorry?

32:24.440 --> 32:26.200
I accidentally stepped on it

32:31.119 --> 32:31.839
Are you angry?

32:32.240 --> 32:33.759
Why are you so angry?

32:33.839 --> 32:34.960
I'll show you

32:34.960 --> 32:37.359
How strong is General Dongdu’s head?

32:37.359 --> 32:37.880
Kneel down

32:37.880 --> 32:38.759
Give me strength

32:40.000 --> 32:40.839
press

32:42.839 --> 32:43.680
work hard

32:57.519 --> 32:59.039
Janggwi, Jinwang

32:59.039 --> 33:00.119
Wang Oyuk, Yui

33:00.119 --> 33:01.200
Come quickly

33:01.200 --> 33:03.000
Your family's master is being bullied.

33:03.000 --> 33:03.759
hurry

33:05.039 --> 33:05.799
six jobs

33:07.720 --> 33:09.000
Who did you just call?

33:09.079 --> 33:10.680
I called my servant

33:10.680 --> 33:12.759
It's around here, we'll be there soon.

33:15.720 --> 33:16.279
okay

33:16.279 --> 33:18.279
If not, let's wait

33:18.640 --> 33:19.720
Who are these two people?

33:21.400 --> 33:22.559
One is our servant

33:23.559 --> 33:24.400
one person

33:25.400 --> 33:26.160
I do not know either

33:28.240 --> 33:31.160
It seems like everyone has forgotten about you.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.559
I'll find you a cool place, so
wait there.

33:39.599 --> 33:40.400
Beat me to death

33:40.880 --> 33:42.000
Opportunities like this are rare.

33:44.599 --> 33:45.640
You didn't beat him to death, right?

33:53.039 --> 33:54.640
Because I’m thirsty

33:54.640 --> 33:56.000
I was drinking water

34:15.880 --> 34:17.280
I'm glad you didn't hurt your eyes.

34:17.840 --> 34:19.000
My face is ruined

34:19.280 --> 34:20.239
Eyebrows represent brothers.

34:20.880 --> 34:22.239
I saw it in a physiognomy book

34:22.400 --> 34:23.559
Acquired loss of eyebrows

34:23.559 --> 34:24.800
They say brothers become enemies

34:25.280 --> 34:27.119
I'll go and ask if there is a solution.

34:27.639 --> 34:28.880
The grain store owner

34:28.880 --> 34:30.119
Do you know how to look at physiognomy?

34:30.320 --> 34:31.920
There is a fortune telling teacher next to my store.

34:31.920 --> 34:33.239
Sometimes I steal rice

34:33.239 --> 34:34.320
I gave it to the fortune telling teacher.

34:34.320 --> 34:35.719
They ask me to teach them a trick.

34:38.119 --> 34:39.400
You asked me to teach you a trick?

34:39.719 --> 34:40.880
If that person is talented

34:41.280 --> 34:43.000
Was it necessary for you to steal rice?

34:44.800 --> 34:45.400
When I see it

34:45.400 --> 34:46.880
That fortune telling teacher seems to have a talent.

34:47.639 --> 34:48.679
The teacher

34:48.679 --> 34:49.800
The grain store owner

34:49.800 --> 34:51.000
He knew that people would steal rice for him.

34:51.119 --> 34:52.280
the slate

34:52.280 --> 34:53.760
It must have been opened next to a grain store.

35:00.119 --> 35:01.679
Thanks for your help

35:02.000 --> 35:03.159
What is your name?

35:03.880 --> 35:04.559
Me?

35:06.760 --> 35:07.880
They say it's a minor

35:09.239 --> 35:10.599
You are my friend

35:12.440 --> 35:13.679
Who is your servant?

35:13.840 --> 35:14.440
no

35:16.679 --> 35:17.880
This is Chuwaru’s servant.

35:18.320 --> 35:19.199
Your servant

35:19.199 --> 35:20.719
Why are you friends with a turtle?

35:23.199 --> 35:24.199
What's wrong with the turtle?

35:24.559 --> 35:25.880
Just now this turtle hyung

35:25.880 --> 35:26.800
If you didn't help me

35:27.000 --> 35:28.239
You, the grain store master,

35:28.360 --> 35:30.159
It probably turned into a piece of cake

35:30.920 --> 35:31.559
why?

35:32.320 --> 35:33.920
Now it's wet and dead

35:34.039 --> 35:34.960
You don't admit it?

35:40.719 --> 35:42.280
Rather stay at Chuhwaru.

35:42.280 --> 35:43.280
Don't come to my room

35:43.639 --> 35:44.360
It's unclean

35:44.800 --> 35:45.639
No, ma'am

35:45.639 --> 35:46.960
This is all Joe Giant

35:46.960 --> 35:48.760
They dragged me in because they wanted to entertain me.

35:48.760 --> 35:51.880
I just had a little drink.

35:53.039 --> 35:53.760
second elder

35:53.920 --> 35:55.360
About me

35:55.599 --> 35:56.880
entertainment

35:56.880 --> 35:58.880
I think it can only be called entertainment if it feels like entertainment.

36:00.119 --> 36:01.400
A passionate encounter is difficult to break up with

36:01.880 --> 36:03.119
They say it will be difficult to meet again if it cools down.

36:04.280 --> 36:06.440
Look at this, it hasn't even gotten dark.

36:06.559 --> 36:07.800
If you come back so quickly

36:07.800 --> 36:09.800
Wouldn’t it ruin someone else’s excitement?

36:10.320 --> 36:11.000
honey

36:11.000 --> 36:12.320
Go back quickly

36:12.320 --> 36:13.119
Enjoy it hot

36:13.119 --> 36:14.079
No, ma'am

36:14.639 --> 36:15.199
ma'am

36:15.199 --> 36:16.480
six jobs

36:17.360 --> 36:18.440
What are you holding like that?

36:20.159 --> 36:22.440
This is the hangover soup that Sooksu
made for the second elder.

36:23.039 --> 36:24.000
Now it's for my father

36:24.559 --> 36:25.760
I don't think it's necessary

36:26.320 --> 36:27.800
My mother is already waking me up

36:30.199 --> 36:30.800
let's go

36:31.079 --> 36:32.280
Let's play in the backyard flower garden

36:32.639 --> 36:34.400
Don't interfere with your father sobering up.

36:34.400 --> 36:35.760
No, where are you going?

36:36.079 --> 36:37.840
Are you going to leave me here alone?

36:39.039 --> 36:40.320
What's wrong with being alone?

36:44.920 --> 36:45.519
Let's do it this way

36:46.760 --> 36:47.440
I

36:47.440 --> 36:50.719
Let me test how you studied today.

36:51.800 --> 36:54.199
What did you learn at Seodang today?

36:55.159 --> 36:56.320
today

36:56.320 --> 36:57.559
I learned ‘Analects of Confucius’

36:59.280 --> 37:00.159
Confucius said

37:00.360 --> 37:01.360
Lee Eui-ho!

37:01.920 --> 37:04.119
Omigyeonhodeok is a lecherous woman

37:06.280 --> 37:06.880
father

37:07.719 --> 37:09.119
What does this mean?

37:11.320 --> 37:13.559
Didn’t the teacher teach you?

37:13.719 --> 37:15.000
What does this mean?

37:16.559 --> 37:17.679
You told me

37:17.760 --> 37:19.119
What this means is...

37:19.519 --> 37:20.440
Confucius said

37:20.639 --> 37:21.440
It's the end.

37:21.800 --> 37:23.519
I'm a person who likes colors

37:23.519 --> 37:24.480
I have never seen anyone who likes virtue.

37:28.760 --> 37:29.440
father

37:30.039 --> 37:31.079
Is there anything else you can teach me?

37:36.320 --> 37:39.079
Your teacher's interpretation is correct.

37:39.679 --> 37:42.440
I have nothing more to teach you

37:43.239 --> 37:43.840
father

37:44.159 --> 37:45.960
Omigyeonhodeok is a lecherous woman

37:45.960 --> 37:46.719
This passage is from the ‘Analects of Confucius’

37:46.719 --> 37:47.920
It didn't happen once or twice

37:48.400 --> 37:49.599
In addition to ‘Memorial Flight’

37:49.800 --> 37:51.440
It also appeared in ‘Jahanpyeon’

37:52.039 --> 37:53.199
What is the reason?

37:53.519 --> 37:55.000
Maybe this verse

37:55.000 --> 37:56.440
In ‘Analects of Confucius’

37:56.719 --> 37:58.000
Is it the most important phrase?

38:02.239 --> 38:03.000
Poor guy

38:03.320 --> 38:04.679
Have you already learned something this profound?

38:08.880 --> 38:10.840
He said he would test my son.

38:10.840 --> 38:12.639
Instead, you got hit?

38:13.719 --> 38:15.000
A person named Sujae

38:15.519 --> 38:16.960
Don't lose face in front of your son.

38:37.960 --> 38:39.599
I was with my butler before.

38:40.280 --> 38:41.519
How did you come alone today?

38:41.519 --> 38:43.440
Chungya went to the field to do some work.

38:45.920 --> 38:46.880
You and Chungya

38:46.880 --> 38:47.920
I saw you fishing here

38:48.039 --> 38:49.320
I thought it was easy to catch

38:49.320 --> 38:50.599
I came fishing a few times.

38:50.760 --> 38:53.239
The results are always dismal.

38:53.360 --> 38:54.280
The fish here are

38:54.400 --> 38:55.719
Smarter than the ones at home

38:56.239 --> 38:57.360
You're just hiding your face.

38:58.320 --> 38:59.480
All adults say that.

38:59.480 --> 39:00.840
People naturally become friends

39:01.760 --> 39:02.880
But I don’t think it’s a fish

39:05.360 --> 39:06.039
Yukjikah

39:06.480 --> 39:07.719
Your last name wasn't Yuk from the beginning, right?

39:08.119 --> 39:10.239
I am a beggar who was picked up by the Yuk family.

39:11.400 --> 39:12.800
So I followed the Yuk family’s last name.

39:13.000 --> 39:13.920
I think

39:15.239 --> 39:16.239
My uncle picked it up for me too.

39:16.239 --> 39:17.280
I feel like I've become a master

39:20.400 --> 39:21.239
If I say this

39:21.480 --> 39:23.639
Do you want to look like you don't care about other people's circumstances
?

39:25.320 --> 39:26.400
Because everyone has a destiny

39:29.119 --> 39:30.199
What is your original last name?

39:32.519 --> 39:33.239
Mr. Seol

39:33.840 --> 39:34.639
How old are you?

39:34.960 --> 39:35.840
It's the year of the horse

39:36.039 --> 39:36.920
What month are you born in?

39:36.920 --> 39:37.519
It's April

39:37.719 --> 39:38.880
Well, he was born two months earlier than me.

39:45.280 --> 39:45.920
Brother Seol

39:46.360 --> 39:48.880
Greetings from Yukbulwoo

39:59.119 --> 40:00.480
Rep. Jeong

40:01.199 --> 40:02.559
After quitting about two coats

40:04.400 --> 40:07.920
Yuk Won-bok's health is recovering again.

40:10.079 --> 40:12.199
Killing six atomic bombs
won't do us any good.

40:16.119 --> 40:17.440
Do you want to give up?

40:25.920 --> 40:26.639
Chungya

40:27.920 --> 40:29.719
Second, after the elder’s family came here

40:30.119 --> 40:32.239
Our plans have been postponed

40:33.440 --> 40:36.320
But I felt rather relieved.

40:36.320 --> 40:37.320
Chungya

40:38.159 --> 40:40.079
I can sleep comfortably now

40:41.719 --> 40:43.320
before we

40:43.719 --> 40:44.599
With Mr. Wang

40:44.599 --> 40:46.480
If you think back on what you said to Rep. Jeong,

40:46.840 --> 40:48.199
It's like a dream

40:49.519 --> 40:50.719
I now

40:52.079 --> 40:53.119
I think it's off

40:53.280 --> 40:54.119
can't escape

40:55.360 --> 40:57.320
you can't escape forever

40:58.320 --> 40:59.199
For life?

41:04.360 --> 41:05.920
If we don't implement this plan

41:07.079 --> 41:08.000
until I die

41:09.119 --> 41:10.280
I have to live dumb

41:11.079 --> 41:11.840
until you die

41:13.119 --> 41:14.360
I have to live as a slave in this house.

41:16.199 --> 41:16.920
Chungya

41:19.519 --> 41:20.920
I'm not sure

41:21.880 --> 41:23.920
What should I do next?

41:28.880 --> 41:31.119
I don't know if I should continue

41:34.320 --> 41:35.119
Yukjikah

41:36.119 --> 41:37.519
That's what Bulwoo said to me.

41:38.039 --> 41:39.719
I want to make you my sister-in-law

41:40.480 --> 41:42.400
You and the unfortunate are also meant to be

41:42.760 --> 41:44.559
Since you have studied writing before,

41:44.719 --> 41:47.079
I talked to my brother.

41:47.079 --> 41:47.719
Second child

41:48.519 --> 41:50.320
This kid was my litter

41:51.960 --> 41:55.760
But I'm not satisfied with Baedong.

41:56.519 --> 41:58.320
How could you insist on having me as your father ?

41:59.760 --> 42:00.719
To be honest

42:01.159 --> 42:02.800
Joe The Giant likes you.

42:03.159 --> 42:04.400
to me many times

42:04.400 --> 42:05.880
They say they want to buy you out

42:06.719 --> 42:07.880
What do you think?

42:13.559 --> 42:14.679
That giant giant

42:14.679 --> 42:16.719
It would be easier to fool than me.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.920
If you make Giant Joe feel good

42:19.239 --> 42:21.199
Couldn't I say I will make you my son?

42:28.280 --> 42:28.960
Yukjikah

42:30.199 --> 42:31.679
Do you want to be Bae Dong?

42:32.480 --> 42:34.360
Or do you want to follow Joe Giant?

42:35.519 --> 42:36.639
I will donate

42:37.719 --> 42:39.239
If you do the distribution

42:39.239 --> 42:40.599
Wouldn’t it be unfair?

42:42.360 --> 42:43.159
Yukjikah

42:43.960 --> 42:45.199
There's nothing to worry about

42:45.719 --> 42:46.960
Because you are intelligent and clever

42:47.599 --> 42:49.119
To be loyal to our Yuk family

42:49.559 --> 42:50.800
I know

42:51.400 --> 42:53.760
I'm good at persuading my brother

42:54.119 --> 42:56.199
Don't let me sell you to Giant Joe.

42:56.800 --> 42:58.039
If you do your best

42:59.079 --> 43:01.239
You too will become the owner later

43:01.320 --> 43:02.280
You can become a butler

43:02.880 --> 43:04.559
If you don't have any other thoughts

43:05.360 --> 43:06.360
my family

43:06.599 --> 43:08.639
I will keep you by my side and
serve us for the rest of my life.

43:10.760 --> 43:12.159
Are you saying you'll take care of it for life?

43:13.440 --> 43:14.280
Second child

43:14.440 --> 43:16.239
Only you have become a good person

43:17.119 --> 43:18.800
Okay, I'll do as you say.

43:20.480 --> 43:21.199
Yukjikah

43:21.679 --> 43:23.679
Stay and become the master's companion.

43:24.199 --> 43:26.119
I won't let the giant give up

43:29.840 --> 43:30.960
What are you looking at?

43:32.000 --> 43:33.840
Don't thank the second elder

43:40.000 --> 43:40.920
Second Elder, thank you

43:41.679 --> 43:43.800
Thanks to the second adult today

43:44.760 --> 43:46.159
I knew what to do

43:48.559 --> 43:50.000
I'm moving forward

43:50.679 --> 43:53.559
I will do anything for the sake of the Yuk family.

43:54.840 --> 43:56.000
I'll do my best

44:01.400 --> 44:02.199
Rep. Jeong

44:02.920 --> 44:04.159
Please add a little more medicine.

44:05.119 --> 44:06.000
What medicine do you mean?

44:06.000 --> 44:07.880
A drug that can kill a person

44:08.320 --> 44:09.960
Are you out of your mind?

44:09.960 --> 44:11.599
The medicine I gave you is also effective.

44:11.599 --> 44:13.159
Just a little slow

44:13.159 --> 44:14.440
But if you suddenly ask me to use strong medicine,

44:15.000 --> 44:16.559
Isn’t there a gift left?

44:16.800 --> 44:19.079
Even if the gift remains,
it won’t be detrimental to Rep. Jeong.

44:25.239 --> 44:26.119
Rep. Jeong

44:26.840 --> 44:29.199
It doesn't matter if you don't give me medicine.

44:29.920 --> 44:30.760
To me

44:31.719 --> 44:33.800
There is arsenic that can even kill rats.

44:34.679 --> 44:35.400
If it doesn't work out

44:35.719 --> 44:37.360
You can just put it in the medicine that Rep. Jeong gave you.

44:46.920 --> 44:48.079
Okay, I'll do it.

44:55.320 --> 44:56.039
Big brother

44:56.400 --> 44:57.239
(Memorial tablet of the six atomic bombs of my brother)

44:57.239 --> 44:58.119
Big brother

44:59.960 --> 45:01.400
The love between our brothers

45:01.800 --> 45:03.719
It's so short

45:04.440 --> 45:06.360
How did you end up here?

45:07.679 --> 45:08.440
Big brother

45:08.971 --> 45:10.030
(A favor received will always be repaid)

45:10.039 --> 45:11.039
Big brother

45:21.599 --> 45:22.400
young master

45:23.159 --> 45:24.239
The six atomic bombs have already been dealt with.

45:24.760 --> 45:26.039
Who will we deal with next?

45:27.360 --> 45:28.280
Let's wait a moment

45:29.239 --> 45:30.880
Let's wait about three months.

45:39.719 --> 45:40.480
Sooksu

45:40.800 --> 45:42.119
Master, please sit down.

45:42.639 --> 45:44.840
This duck meat is done right away.

45:44.840 --> 45:46.000
It's delicious if you eat it while it's hot.

45:49.320 --> 45:50.079
Sooksu

45:50.679 --> 45:52.239
Isn’t it Suksoo’s birthday today?

45:53.480 --> 45:54.880
How can I be the only one?

45:56.079 --> 45:58.480
I only called you Mr.

45:58.880 --> 46:00.719
Do you have something to tell me?

46:17.480 --> 46:18.440
young master

46:18.599 --> 46:20.000
incident

46:21.000 --> 46:21.920
He committed it

46:25.480 --> 46:26.400
What did you say just now?

46:27.719 --> 46:29.159
That incident

46:30.480 --> 46:32.719
The case of poisoning an elderly person

46:34.480 --> 46:35.199
I committed it.

46:38.360 --> 46:40.000
Sir, are you drunk?

46:40.599 --> 46:42.079
How can you say such a thing?

46:42.320 --> 46:43.119
I have business to do

46:43.719 --> 46:44.320
Let's go first

46:44.320 --> 46:44.960
Sit!

46:53.320 --> 46:54.159
young master

46:56.280 --> 46:58.559
think about it carefully

47:00.079 --> 47:03.639
I'm on your side

47:03.639 --> 47:04.360
Otherwise

47:05.159 --> 47:07.400
Call the master here

47:08.159 --> 47:09.679
There's no way you could say something like this, right?

47:10.320 --> 47:11.320
Sooksu

47:12.599 --> 47:15.000
What is the reason for this happening all of a sudden?

47:18.440 --> 47:19.679
You know this, too, right?

47:20.119 --> 47:20.800
I am

47:21.280 --> 47:22.719
Janggwi, Jinwang and

47:23.400 --> 47:24.800
It's a drinking party

47:26.239 --> 47:27.760
Every few days we

47:27.760 --> 47:29.239
We're drinking together

47:29.719 --> 47:31.559
I drink enough to get drunk every time.

47:32.760 --> 47:34.159
As long as Jang Gui and King Jin get drunk,

47:34.159 --> 47:37.840
I keep talking.

47:40.400 --> 47:41.519
between these two months

47:42.239 --> 47:44.360
I roughly

47:44.360 --> 47:46.679
I noticed it

47:46.840 --> 47:49.280
Of course, I said it when I was drunk.

47:49.599 --> 47:51.440
someday

47:51.440 --> 47:52.639
Who knows, maybe you'll even remember it?

47:53.079 --> 47:54.360
When that time comes

47:55.000 --> 47:58.280
My life is in danger

47:59.639 --> 48:01.239
I gave it some thought.

48:01.239 --> 48:03.760
Then, rather than pretending not to know and
hoping for a fluke,

48:04.679 --> 48:05.639
rather

48:06.719 --> 48:08.440
I told the master openly

48:09.960 --> 48:11.119
If we hold hands

48:12.280 --> 48:15.039
I thought there might be good results.

48:16.760 --> 48:18.360
If not, report it to the government office.

48:18.360 --> 48:20.039
Second, report it to the elder.

48:23.840 --> 48:24.519
Me?

48:25.880 --> 48:26.719
like me

48:27.960 --> 48:29.159
Are you staying overnight?

48:31.159 --> 48:33.360
What those two servants said while drunk

48:33.360 --> 48:35.400
If you report this case as a murder case

48:35.960 --> 48:37.320
Who will believe it?

48:39.800 --> 48:40.719
Sooksu

48:42.000 --> 48:43.159
I underestimated you, Master.

48:45.360 --> 48:47.719
Before, I just thought you were ignorant.

48:48.559 --> 48:50.039
The only person who was this careful

48:50.639 --> 48:52.079
I never even thought about it

48:54.239 --> 48:55.119
young master

48:55.719 --> 48:57.039
You lift me up so much

48:57.639 --> 48:59.280
That's right, I'm ignorant.

48:59.719 --> 49:02.440
But even ignorant people have ideas.

49:06.000 --> 49:06.760
Sooksu

49:07.679 --> 49:08.360
I was rude

49:20.880 --> 49:22.039
Sore

49:22.679 --> 49:23.760
Master

49:24.800 --> 49:26.480
I don't know if you'll believe me

49:28.400 --> 49:29.599
I want to believe in you

49:30.239 --> 49:33.440
But with just a few words

49:33.599 --> 49:35.360
How can I believe it?

49:37.920 --> 49:39.119
I understand everything too

49:41.480 --> 49:42.679
If so, let me tell you.

49:42.920 --> 49:45.280
What should I do so that you will trust me?

49:45.880 --> 49:46.760
Let's do this

49:48.559 --> 49:49.519
tomorrow morning

49:50.280 --> 49:52.079
Under the firewood in the barn

49:52.079 --> 49:53.119
find this bowl

49:54.719 --> 49:55.440
under the bowl

49:57.480 --> 49:58.559
There must be a bag of medicine.

49:58.559 --> 49:59.760
Choose any of the servants

49:59.760 --> 50:01.559
Put medicine in that person’s food.

50:01.559 --> 50:02.440
I say it openly

50:04.519 --> 50:07.320
This is a poison that kills instantly if it enters the bloodstream.

50:08.480 --> 50:09.480
to me

50:09.480 --> 50:10.760
There is a way to solve the problem on the government side.

50:11.400 --> 50:13.559
If you say he died of illness, that's enough.

50:16.320 --> 50:17.679
If only you could do it

50:19.559 --> 50:20.400
I'll believe you

50:25.280 --> 50:26.079
young master

50:26.639 --> 50:28.920
poisoning people

50:28.920 --> 50:30.440
What's so difficult?

50:30.960 --> 50:31.960
I will do it

50:33.079 --> 50:35.599
I wonder who they will poison then?

50:41.679 --> 50:42.960
I'm Wang Oh-yuk, a chore worker.

50:43.880 --> 50:45.679
I still haven't paid the money I owe him.

50:50.039 --> 50:52.400
Otherwise, I 'll be ready to collect the body .

50:54.960 --> 50:56.280
No way?

50:59.760 --> 51:00.480
young master

51:01.480 --> 51:02.360
Sooksu

51:03.519 --> 51:04.360
young master

51:04.920 --> 51:05.480
I...

51:05.800 --> 51:08.360
I really used that drug

51:09.000 --> 51:10.320
And that's a considerable amount.

51:10.880 --> 51:11.639
All in one bag

51:11.800 --> 51:13.159
I put it in

51:13.960 --> 51:16.320
I haven't seen Wang Oyuk all day.

51:16.440 --> 51:18.039
But he didn't die

51:18.679 --> 51:20.440
I was in and out of the back all day last night.

51:20.559 --> 51:21.920
Today I just slept all day

51:23.320 --> 51:24.239
young master

51:25.039 --> 51:26.800
Isn't that medicine fake?

51:27.079 --> 51:27.920
Maybe there is medicine

51:29.960 --> 51:32.000
Isn't that ineffective?

51:33.440 --> 51:35.000
It seems to be working?

51:37.920 --> 51:40.000
What I gave to my master was a laxative.

51:47.880 --> 51:49.000
I'll believe you

51:49.480 --> 51:50.360
Sooksu

51:57.119 --> 51:57.880
light it up

52:03.880 --> 52:06.000
No, you want to kill everyone?

52:10.280 --> 52:10.880
young master

52:11.280 --> 52:12.719
Think about it again

52:13.480 --> 52:14.880
There's no need to kill them all, right?

52:15.760 --> 52:17.199
If you kill just four members of the Yuk family,

52:17.199 --> 52:17.880
Being...

52:18.719 --> 52:19.719
furthermore

52:20.000 --> 52:20.920
so many people

52:20.920 --> 52:22.599
Everyone has hands and feet

52:22.719 --> 52:24.159
How

52:24.159 --> 52:25.039
Do you keep them in one place?

52:25.039 --> 52:27.360
It's obvious that at least one or two people will escape.

52:27.880 --> 52:28.920
before starting the fire

52:28.920 --> 52:30.039
What if I kill them all?

52:30.199 --> 52:31.400
But with so many servants

52:32.000 --> 52:33.159
The four members of the Yuk family

52:33.760 --> 52:35.159
me and death penalty

52:36.039 --> 52:37.320
And even if we join forces until the middle of the night

52:38.800 --> 52:40.360
Killing them all at once

52:41.760 --> 52:43.079
As long as you don't make a fuss

52:44.199 --> 52:45.800
It is difficult

52:51.880 --> 52:52.599
Chungya

52:53.400 --> 52:55.119
Is there anything you are worried about?

52:59.119 --> 53:03.840
(It's hard to kill them all)

53:04.400 --> 53:07.079
(Postprocessing is more difficult)

53:09.559 --> 53:10.880
Chungya’s words are

53:11.719 --> 53:14.000
My whole family died in a fire.

53:15.079 --> 53:17.519
If the servant who fortunately survives
takes all the property,

53:17.920 --> 53:19.719
It's obvious that I'll be suspicious

53:22.920 --> 53:25.239
Even if there is a will

53:25.519 --> 53:28.079
The government does not believe it

53:28.960 --> 53:31.679
Are you saying they're going to interrogate me because they think I killed my owner and stole his property ?

53:35.639 --> 53:37.840
I also know a bit about government affairs.

53:39.559 --> 53:40.440
The time has come

53:41.519 --> 53:42.559
When the sentence is handed down

53:51.039 --> 53:52.719
I will also tell the truth about everything.

53:53.679 --> 53:54.199
ruler

53:58.280 --> 54:00.039
There's nothing to worry about

54:04.039 --> 54:05.400
That's actually easier to solve

54:05.519 --> 54:07.000
The difficult thing now

54:07.000 --> 54:08.320
Those people

54:08.320 --> 54:10.480
Let them burn to death in one place.

54:11.119 --> 54:12.079
It's not that difficult either

54:17.480 --> 54:18.840
This is datura powder

54:19.480 --> 54:20.840
Datura of Yeongnam

54:20.840 --> 54:22.559
It's not a rare flower either.

54:23.000 --> 54:24.920
This is made from datura

54:25.280 --> 54:26.079
Anesthetic?

54:27.000 --> 54:27.920
Just eating makes me fall asleep

54:29.239 --> 54:30.719
How many people
can you take down with this one bottle?

54:31.000 --> 54:32.639
It's enough to knock down a couple of guys

54:32.760 --> 54:34.119
If so, isn't the difference too big?

54:34.840 --> 54:36.440
I know where you can make this.

54:43.440 --> 54:44.480
Is this amount okay?

54:52.480 --> 54:53.719
I can taste it too

54:54.159 --> 54:55.960
If you put this in your food, you could get caught.

54:57.280 --> 54:59.000
If you don't stir it properly

54:59.280 --> 55:01.440
And the amount will not be enough

55:02.599 --> 55:03.800
I usually put it in alcohol.

55:07.079 --> 55:09.360
Or I'll make Palbochantang (palbochantang)

55:10.079 --> 55:12.639
The soup contains alcohol and sheep fat.

55:13.679 --> 55:15.480
Chives are also added

55:15.480 --> 55:17.199
It will cover the taste.

55:18.079 --> 55:20.000
Put the medicine in the bath

55:20.480 --> 55:22.400
Season the food a little salty

55:23.760 --> 55:25.039
Just feed it a lot.

55:29.559 --> 55:31.320
From the looks of it, this isn't difficult.

56:47.760 --> 56:49.519
If you are truly six poor

56:51.800 --> 56:53.199
Where is that person now?

56:54.199 --> 56:55.159
It's in the government office.

57:03.679 --> 57:04.519
This is a bad smell

57:04.519 --> 57:06.559
This is a note hidden in the donkey’s body.

57:07.639 --> 57:08.599
20 years have passed

57:09.039 --> 57:10.639
The culprit is probably

57:10.639 --> 57:11.840
You must have been thinking about how to get revenge.

57:12.559 --> 57:13.960
Moreover, the snow giant

57:14.760 --> 57:15.639
already

57:15.639 --> 57:17.800
That he has become a rich and powerful
giant

57:17.960 --> 57:18.679
my teacher

57:18.679 --> 57:20.800
You probably know that I helped the Seol Giant get rid of Jeungjwa .

57:21.079 --> 57:21.840
So

57:24.079 --> 57:25.760
the most direct and

57:28.960 --> 57:30.519
You must have used a refreshing method.

57:42.610 --> 57:43.782
(The above prefectural ordinance is six fires)

57:47.159 --> 57:48.239
The above prefecture?

57:54.440 --> 57:56.480
The above prefecture is said to be six poor people?

58:01.554 --> 58:03.000
