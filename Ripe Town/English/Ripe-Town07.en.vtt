00:36.520 --> 00:38.119
Is it possible that this monkey demon

00:39.399 --> 00:40.719
is the murderer?

00:41.039 --> 00:42.000
He's good

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
in agility.

00:44.280 --> 00:45.184
What if the monkey demon

00:46.320 --> 00:48.880
is just a smokescreen released
by the murderer

00:50.520 --> 00:52.200
and the murderer's target

00:54.119 --> 00:56.479
is not the two people
you both are watching?

01:00.320 --> 01:01.184
Well,

01:01.560 --> 01:02.479
you are alone.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Not only me.

01:05.719 --> 01:06.879
We have all split up.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.280
All alone.

01:09.760 --> 01:10.688
And also,

01:11.840 --> 01:13.280
we don't know where the murderer is,

01:14.079 --> 01:16.719
yet the murderer knows
exactly where each of us is.

01:17.439 --> 01:18.879
We aren't concerned
about the monkey demon.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.200
My senior and I will protect you.

01:23.400 --> 01:24.480
In this way,

01:25.760 --> 01:27.040
the murderer will be bold

01:27.040 --> 01:29.439
to kill the two people you are watching.

01:29.799 --> 01:31.120
This adversary of ours

01:32.040 --> 01:33.560
is not simple.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.400
However, when I think about it,

01:37.760 --> 01:38.719
these two people

01:40.519 --> 01:41.799
sort of deserve to die.

03:12.160 --> 03:16.096
=Ripe Town=
=Episode 7=

03:17.680 --> 03:18.656
Take this back.

03:20.960 --> 03:23.120
You win this bet.

03:29.240 --> 03:30.280
Thank you.

03:34.199 --> 03:35.159
Don't thank me.

03:35.919 --> 03:36.832
Well,

03:40.560 --> 03:41.759
you can thank this monkey demon.

03:43.800 --> 03:46.000
Has Captain Xia already taken him
back to the Nietai Yamen?

03:48.128 --> 03:49.080
He just left.

03:49.080 --> 03:50.280
He got an interrogation record?

03:52.360 --> 03:53.759
I already had one.

03:54.639 --> 03:58.080
But after Captain Xia returns
to the Nietai Yamen,

03:59.039 --> 04:00.360
surely he will use some torture

04:01.719 --> 04:03.800
to get something useful for him.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.479
He will pin this case
on the monkey demon.

04:07.039 --> 04:08.840
If Captain Xia intends
to falsely accuse someone,

04:09.159 --> 04:11.199
it's hard to think
of a perfect confession.

04:11.319 --> 04:13.599
A captain and a teacher were killed.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.319
It's difficult to fabricate the motive.

04:18.639 --> 04:19.879
So it is you.

04:24.879 --> 04:25.824
What do you mean?

04:29.040 --> 04:30.519
It's something common in the Yamen.

04:31.240 --> 04:33.120
The confiscated items
often contain some extra stuff

04:33.120 --> 04:35.720
that happens to be useful
for the bailiff in their case-solving.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.959
Captain Leng's badge was among them.

04:41.279 --> 04:42.600
You put it in.

04:45.279 --> 04:46.120
Mr. Song.

04:47.480 --> 04:48.959
I bet you have never visited

04:50.079 --> 04:51.959
the watchhouse of the Hunter Squad.

04:53.600 --> 04:54.560
After we

04:54.759 --> 04:56.120
hand over shifts,

04:56.639 --> 04:58.759
we will hang our badges on the wall.

04:59.759 --> 05:01.040
(Although my master is gone,)

05:01.240 --> 05:02.279
(I still keep his badge)

05:02.639 --> 05:03.879
(in the watchhouse.)

05:04.240 --> 05:05.560
(I wipe it every day.)

05:06.040 --> 05:06.920
(Probably,)

05:07.480 --> 05:09.399
(they noticed it.)

05:10.560 --> 05:11.959
You want to use that thief

05:13.879 --> 05:15.199
to send away Captain Xia.

05:15.639 --> 05:16.959
That thief is not wronged.

05:18.439 --> 05:19.959
I will find the real culprit.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.519
By then, I'll just sentence that thief

05:23.000 --> 05:24.680
for theft.

05:43.279 --> 05:44.319
Check it out.

05:45.319 --> 05:47.079
This is a list of antiques purchased.

05:47.360 --> 05:49.680
It's found among the stolen goods
of that monkey demon.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.040
Captain Xia thought it was useless.

05:51.360 --> 05:52.800
It's another common practice
in the Yamen.

05:53.560 --> 05:54.639
Misleading things

05:55.800 --> 05:57.240
will disappear from the evidence.

05:57.519 --> 05:59.160
It looks like a note
by an antique dealer.

06:00.680 --> 06:03.240
It's the kind who goes
from house to house collecting antiques.

06:03.639 --> 06:05.879
It notes what he collected
from which family

06:05.879 --> 06:06.920
and how much money he spent.

06:07.199 --> 06:08.360
The monkey demon committed crimes

06:09.199 --> 06:10.680
according to this list.

06:10.879 --> 06:12.600
He's smart, right?

06:12.879 --> 06:14.199
The people who just sold an antique

06:14.680 --> 06:15.680
are bound to have money.

06:16.680 --> 06:19.480
Where did this monkey demon
get this list?

06:19.600 --> 06:20.480
From the Mao County.

06:21.279 --> 06:23.240
There's a place called Taipingzao.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.519
It's a den of thieves disposing
of stolen goods.

06:27.079 --> 06:29.319
It's not unusual for antique dealers

06:29.319 --> 06:30.839
to buy stolen goods at the Taipingzao.

06:31.480 --> 06:35.839
It's also quite common
to sell the purchasing list to thieves.

06:36.360 --> 06:38.199
I have already sent people
to get their leader.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.560
But most likely,
they won't be able to get him.

06:43.560 --> 06:44.416
Mr. Song.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.079
I still think
there's nothing suspicious about this.

06:49.480 --> 06:50.560
It's nothing suspicious?

06:51.680 --> 06:54.399
I have asked the owners

06:54.399 --> 06:55.680
of lost properties.

06:55.680 --> 06:58.480
They all said that they had no antiques.

06:58.680 --> 06:59.520
What?

07:01.439 --> 07:04.519
Or they don't consider these goods

07:07.240 --> 07:08.120
as antiques.

07:08.560 --> 07:10.439
The antique dealer came to them,

07:11.040 --> 07:12.240
insisting that their broken bowls,

07:13.079 --> 07:17.600
old pots, and old fans were antiques.

07:17.759 --> 07:19.639
He paid a lot of money to buy them.

07:19.879 --> 07:22.959
He sold the list to the monkey demon
through the Taipingzao.

07:26.879 --> 07:27.800
That's to say,

07:29.480 --> 07:31.279
he lured the monkey demon here.

07:31.720 --> 07:33.959
And he made the monkey demon appear

07:33.959 --> 07:35.639
as planned.

07:40.120 --> 07:41.600
But why did he do that?

07:45.600 --> 07:48.160
According to the victims,

07:48.439 --> 07:49.800
this antique dealer

07:51.040 --> 07:53.079
is a bearded man in a bamboo hat.

08:00.839 --> 08:03.519
Poor monkey demon.

08:03.959 --> 08:05.319
Captain Xia wants to use him.

08:05.839 --> 08:06.839
You want to use him.

08:07.319 --> 08:08.959
Even the murderer wants to use him.

08:09.199 --> 08:10.519
He probably

08:11.639 --> 08:13.480
has never been so useful in his life.

08:15.360 --> 08:19.904
(Yaowang Temple)

08:25.184 --> 08:27.072
(Such a person
could actually get such a disease.)

08:36.960 --> 08:37.960
Another one died.

08:37.960 --> 08:39.639
Dr. Cheng Yizhi.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.120
He felt my pulse the other day.

08:51.039 --> 08:51.904
A bailiff,

08:53.000 --> 08:54.039
a teacher,

08:54.159 --> 08:55.639
and a doctor.

08:57.799 --> 09:00.840
What on earth does the murderer want?

09:04.039 --> 09:04.928
Sir.

09:05.080 --> 09:06.720
We can first investigate

09:06.960 --> 09:08.320
the cause of death of Dr. Cheng.

09:08.879 --> 09:09.824
Yes.

09:10.799 --> 09:11.712
Coroner.

09:12.240 --> 09:14.159
What's the cause of death?

09:15.159 --> 09:16.128
Sir.

09:16.759 --> 09:18.759
Dr. Cheng's face was purple,

09:19.240 --> 09:20.360
and his lips black.

09:20.919 --> 09:23.120
I determined that he was poisoned.

09:24.399 --> 09:25.320
What poison?

09:26.080 --> 09:27.679
I don't know.

09:28.039 --> 09:31.960
Sir, may I say something?

09:32.200 --> 09:33.184
Who's he?

09:33.399 --> 09:35.240
This is Mr. Liu,
the owner of Bao'an Pharmacy.

09:35.240 --> 09:36.720
We found dozens of prescriptions

09:37.279 --> 09:38.120
on the body,

09:38.200 --> 09:40.600
and the large pot
where the body was placed

09:40.840 --> 09:41.919
was full of medical residues.

09:41.919 --> 09:44.736
So he was specially invited to help.

09:46.639 --> 09:48.120
mr. Liu.

09:48.559 --> 09:49.440
Yes.

09:49.440 --> 09:50.600
What do you want to say?

09:51.159 --> 09:52.159
Sir.

09:52.559 --> 09:55.240
The prescriptions have Mr. Cheng's seal.

09:55.240 --> 09:58.279
And these residues are
from the medicine on the prescriptions.

09:58.399 --> 10:01.679
In my opinion,
Mr. Cheng was poisoned by the medicine

10:02.120 --> 10:03.039
he prescribed.

10:05.000 --> 10:05.919
Poison?

10:07.960 --> 10:08.879
How could Dr. Cheng

10:08.879 --> 10:10.679
prescribe himself poisonous medicine?

10:10.679 --> 10:11.552
No.

10:12.080 --> 10:14.360
Mr. Cheng's prescriptions
have no issues.

10:14.720 --> 10:17.039
They're for the treatment
of ordinary diseases.

10:17.039 --> 10:20.039
But different herbs
have different doses.

10:21.600 --> 10:22.600
It seems

10:22.960 --> 10:25.639
that the murderer brewed the medicines

10:25.639 --> 10:26.639
from dozens of prescriptions

10:26.919 --> 10:28.720
and then fed them to Mr. Cheng.

10:44.919 --> 10:47.120
The medicines are not poisonous,

10:47.480 --> 10:49.720
but they become poisonous when mixed.

10:49.960 --> 10:52.200
All herbs contain trace amounts
of poison.

10:52.320 --> 10:54.919
There are medicinal ingredients
like Kusnezoff Monkshood,

10:55.200 --> 10:57.240
henbane, and windflower
in these prescriptions.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.480
It's surely lethal at such a dosage.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.960
Such a person
could actually get such a disease.

11:19.679 --> 11:20.840
I've looked into it.

11:20.840 --> 11:22.159
As Ran Boniu, a disciple of Confucius,

11:22.159 --> 11:23.519
fell seriously ill,

11:23.720 --> 11:25.080
Confucius said that.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.679
It just means such a person

11:28.159 --> 11:29.679
could actually get such a disease.

11:29.919 --> 11:32.480
A doctor could actually be killed
by his own medicine.

11:34.600 --> 11:36.080
That's why the murderer

11:36.720 --> 11:38.080
left this note.

11:46.559 --> 11:47.456
Mr. Xie.

11:49.120 --> 11:51.799
Shall we report this case?

11:53.320 --> 11:54.272
Yes.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.200
I've drafted the document.

11:56.320 --> 11:57.720
Please review it.

11:58.600 --> 11:59.456
Good.

11:59.799 --> 12:00.640
Let's go.

12:03.799 --> 12:05.159
Captain Xia.

12:05.720 --> 12:08.039
He only knows how to flog people
and catch monkeys.

12:08.039 --> 12:10.240
I must file a complaint against him.

12:12.120 --> 12:12.960
Mr. Song.

12:12.960 --> 12:14.080
I'll take my leave.

12:17.360 --> 12:18.320
Please wait.

12:24.360 --> 12:25.216
mr. Liu.

12:26.440 --> 12:28.159
Please check the two prescriptions.

12:28.519 --> 12:29.799
By Dr. Cheng.

12:29.960 --> 12:31.080
Prescribed 20 years ago.

12:31.279 --> 12:32.720
As you said,

12:33.120 --> 12:35.360
if the medicines
from the two prescriptions

12:35.360 --> 12:36.600
are administered to one patient,

12:37.120 --> 12:38.080
what will happen?

12:49.200 --> 12:50.080
Qu Sangeng.

12:52.039 --> 12:53.000
Where did you

12:54.000 --> 12:55.080
get the prescriptions?

12:56.799 --> 12:58.080
They were left by my master.

12:59.879 --> 13:01.919
I'm not sure
if they're related to this case.

13:02.799 --> 13:03.776
So...

13:04.360 --> 13:05.312
Sir.

13:06.120 --> 13:07.040
mr. Liu.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.128
What do you think?

13:08.799 --> 13:10.200
Suppose you mix the medicines

13:10.480 --> 13:12.759
from these two prescriptions together,

13:13.679 --> 13:15.799
it's okay

13:16.039 --> 13:17.120
to let Chen Wang eat it.

13:18.320 --> 13:20.080
But if it is given to this Lu Yuanbao,

13:20.080 --> 13:22.080
it will be lethal for him.

13:23.519 --> 13:24.480
What will happen to him?

13:25.080 --> 13:27.000
Within half a year,

13:27.320 --> 13:28.759
he will start vomiting blood.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.639
If he continues to take the medicine,
his life will be at serious risk.

13:31.960 --> 13:32.832
mr. Liu.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.000
I remember that anyone
who buys herbs in the pharmacy

13:36.480 --> 13:38.720
must leave a copy of their prescription.

13:38.840 --> 13:39.712
Yes.

13:40.879 --> 13:43.679
This is to make sure
there's a clear record

13:43.919 --> 13:45.240
in case the patient has any problem.

13:45.879 --> 13:47.399
So, even if the patient dies,
they can check

13:47.919 --> 13:49.159
the prescription in the pharmacy.

13:49.519 --> 13:52.000
Dr. Cheng won't be to blame.

13:52.320 --> 13:53.184
Yes.

13:53.720 --> 13:54.639
Coroner.

13:55.240 --> 13:57.639
If a person dies from that,
and you are to perform the autopsy,

13:57.720 --> 13:59.840
will you see it as death by poisoning?

14:05.679 --> 14:06.624
No.

14:12.559 --> 14:15.679
My condition has been erratic
for the past six months.

14:16.080 --> 14:18.799
My days are limited.

14:18.879 --> 14:20.080
You don't need to worry.

14:20.279 --> 14:22.600
In my opinion, you look fine now.

14:22.840 --> 14:25.120
You only need time
for recuperation and rest.

14:25.360 --> 14:27.519
Thank you, Dr. Cheng.

14:28.639 --> 14:30.039
Please have a good rest.

14:30.320 --> 14:31.440
I'll take my leave.

14:33.279 --> 14:36.960
(Dr. Cheng's medical skills came
from his family.)

14:38.120 --> 14:40.039
(But there's one skill
that no one knows)

14:40.639 --> 14:42.320
(where he learned it.)

14:53.960 --> 14:54.880
Mr. Cheng.

15:02.679 --> 15:05.600
Let Mr. Lu take the first dose
around five p.m.

15:07.799 --> 15:09.200
Yes, I see.

15:14.320 --> 15:16.320
But before taking this first dose,

15:16.519 --> 15:18.840
he needs to take the Chongxu Powder.

15:19.519 --> 15:22.120
It needs to be brewed
with boiling water.

15:22.120 --> 15:23.480
And leave it for four hours.

15:23.919 --> 15:26.559
Now is the time to do it.

15:26.679 --> 15:28.320
Go quickly to the kitchen to brew it.

15:38.360 --> 15:40.840
Sir, I will do it after I walk you out.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.320
You don't have to.
The patient can't wait.

15:43.320 --> 15:45.000
You should go right now.

15:45.279 --> 15:46.480
I'm leaving.

15:46.759 --> 15:47.712
Go ahead.

16:31.039 --> 16:31.904
Mr. Zhong.

16:32.480 --> 16:33.519
Dr. Cheng

16:33.519 --> 16:36.039
stole again when he came
for the follow-up visit.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.519
(What did he steal?)

16:43.799 --> 16:45.279
He stole

16:45.279 --> 16:48.320
a sandalwood canister carved
with a golden toad.

16:49.919 --> 16:53.840
(Since you knew he was stealing,)

16:54.120 --> 16:55.639
(why didn't you catch him?)

16:57.320 --> 17:00.039
We invited him to treat Mr. Lu.

17:00.360 --> 17:02.279
He is the best doctor in our county.

17:03.679 --> 17:05.839
Catching him would do us no good.

17:07.279 --> 17:09.960
But I've hidden all the important things

17:09.960 --> 17:12.832
and left inexpensive items
for him to steal.

17:13.079 --> 17:14.359
I'll consider it as his fee.

17:15.839 --> 17:16.704
However,

17:21.240 --> 17:23.440
I recorded all the things he stole.

17:30.599 --> 17:31.480
(What is this?)

17:31.640 --> 17:32.480
An ink stick.

17:33.240 --> 17:34.119
(How to read it?)

17:34.920 --> 17:36.519
She.

17:37.559 --> 17:38.640
It's a place name,

17:39.400 --> 17:40.359
She County.

17:42.960 --> 17:45.880
Mr. Zhong, you don't need
to learn obscure characters.

17:46.279 --> 17:48.039
What I've taught you is enough.

17:49.839 --> 17:52.200
(I'm already mute,)

17:52.599 --> 17:55.000
(I can't be blind.)

17:57.240 --> 17:58.400
If you continue learning,

17:58.400 --> 18:00.319
I won't have enough knowledge
to teach you.

18:01.359 --> 18:03.599
You will have to go to school with me.

18:04.839 --> 18:06.039
(I won't go.)

18:06.480 --> 18:10.039
(I'm afraid the teacher will beat me.)

18:18.480 --> 18:19.392
Mr. Zhong.

18:21.519 --> 18:23.079
Speaking of the teacher
beating students,

18:25.319 --> 18:28.039
I think I know

18:28.039 --> 18:29.839
whose skull is buried
in Mr. Wang's yard.

18:35.559 --> 18:37.000
Where are you going?

18:41.000 --> 18:41.984
To a cemetery.

18:43.599 --> 18:44.960
Why would you visit it?

18:45.960 --> 18:47.640
Today is the death day
of a friend of mine.

18:48.359 --> 18:49.519
I'm going to visit him.

18:51.160 --> 18:53.000
Do you have friends other than me?

18:53.000 --> 18:54.599
How long have you known me?

18:55.359 --> 18:56.519
Almost a year.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.240
That friend of mine

18:58.920 --> 19:00.240
has been dead for five years.

19:02.599 --> 19:03.519
His name is Qiao Gou'er.

19:03.920 --> 19:06.559
Charge.

19:06.960 --> 19:09.000
Qiao Gou'er, follow me.

19:09.000 --> 19:09.960
Go.

19:11.799 --> 19:14.200
Charge.

19:14.799 --> 19:16.000
Go.

19:16.400 --> 19:17.344
Go.

19:19.799 --> 19:20.672
Go.

19:21.799 --> 19:22.799
Adviser?

19:22.799 --> 19:23.648
Yes.

19:23.880 --> 19:26.839
How should I deal with this turtle?

19:27.039 --> 19:30.319
Turtles don't need hands
or feet to turn over.

19:30.319 --> 19:31.960
A nudge with the head
can make them flip over.

19:32.440 --> 19:37.519
Roll over.

19:37.519 --> 19:39.160
You should have stayed away from them.

19:43.119 --> 19:44.599
We were originally familiar
with each other.

19:46.000 --> 19:46.920
But later,

19:47.839 --> 19:49.400
a kid's mother told him

19:50.960 --> 19:51.960
that I was a turtle

19:52.599 --> 19:53.720
and told him not to play with me.

19:55.519 --> 19:56.920
After that, when they saw me,

19:59.240 --> 20:00.559
they started calling me turtle

20:01.240 --> 20:02.119
and bullying me.

20:05.839 --> 20:07.359
That is true for people.

20:08.039 --> 20:10.400
Is Qiao Gou'er really your friend?

20:11.079 --> 20:12.200
Not at this moment.

20:12.519 --> 20:14.000
I want to see a turtle swimming.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.799
- One.
- One.

20:16.799 --> 20:17.799
Two.

20:17.799 --> 20:18.799
- Two.
- Two.

20:18.799 --> 20:20.079
- Three.
- Three.

20:20.359 --> 20:21.440
A turtle is swimming.

20:23.599 --> 20:24.680
A turtle is swimming.

20:26.480 --> 20:29.039
Not all turtles can swim.

20:34.720 --> 20:37.400
Did the turtle drown?

20:37.720 --> 20:39.839
The turtle dived and escaped.

20:40.519 --> 20:41.559
Let's go.

20:58.720 --> 20:59.648
Turtle.

21:00.039 --> 21:00.960
Turtle.

21:01.079 --> 21:02.079
Wake up.

21:02.960 --> 21:03.872
Wake up.

21:13.359 --> 21:14.519
Where are the other people?

21:14.759 --> 21:15.712
They have left.

21:16.839 --> 21:18.319
They threw me into the river.

21:18.839 --> 21:19.720
I saw it.

21:20.319 --> 21:21.400
If I hadn't,

21:22.000 --> 21:22.976
you...

21:23.440 --> 21:24.319
You would have drowned.

21:25.240 --> 21:26.880
I couldn't just stand by
and watch you die.

21:28.319 --> 21:29.200
Thank you.

21:30.440 --> 21:31.400
It's okay.

21:31.400 --> 21:32.680
Turns out you are

21:33.200 --> 21:35.640
a useless turtle.

21:36.640 --> 21:37.759
You can't even swim.

21:38.200 --> 21:40.680
Perhaps, it's because I am a turtle
from the Cuihua Tower.

21:40.799 --> 21:42.240
There are many turtles
in the Cuihua Tower.

21:42.440 --> 21:43.759
Yet, none of them can swim.

21:46.039 --> 21:47.200
Now I can swim.

21:47.680 --> 21:48.680
Qiao Gou'er taught me.

21:49.759 --> 21:52.400
Qiao Gou'er, I have a favor to ask you.

21:52.680 --> 21:54.480
Can you ask them

21:54.799 --> 21:55.799
to stop bullying me?

21:56.359 --> 21:57.200
Okay.

21:57.680 --> 21:59.720
Since I went to the school,

21:59.839 --> 22:00.799
I've been distant from them.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.359
But I'm sure
they don't dare to disobey me.

22:04.519 --> 22:05.759
You go to school?

22:05.880 --> 22:06.799
Is it fun?

22:07.160 --> 22:08.032
No, it's not.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.279
My teacher punishes students.

22:11.240 --> 22:12.839
By the way, what's your surname?

22:13.319 --> 22:14.640
Why?

22:15.400 --> 22:16.839
I'm studying
the Hundred Family Surnames.

22:17.519 --> 22:19.079
I want to know your surname.

22:20.759 --> 22:21.720
I don't have a surname.

22:22.400 --> 22:24.279
My mother didn't know who my father was.

22:24.720 --> 22:26.039
Was your mother from the Cuihua Tower?

22:27.720 --> 22:28.640
My mother is dead.

22:29.119 --> 22:30.519
But she was before she died.

22:35.240 --> 22:37.119
My mother is dead too.

22:41.559 --> 22:42.920
You wait here for me.

22:43.440 --> 22:45.559
I will get you some pastries.

22:47.759 --> 22:48.608
Don't bother.

22:49.359 --> 22:50.272
I'm leaving.

22:52.839 --> 22:53.759
Qiao Gou'er.

22:56.279 --> 22:57.720
Thank you for saving my life.

22:58.319 --> 22:59.200
No problem.

22:59.480 --> 23:01.640
I'll come to play with you
after school tomorrow.

23:01.799 --> 23:02.799
Wait for me by the river bank.

23:04.079 --> 23:04.960
Okay.

23:19.079 --> 23:20.359
His father has already come.

23:29.359 --> 23:31.000
I waited for him as scheduled,

23:32.079 --> 23:33.079
but he didn't show up.

23:34.359 --> 23:36.240
He was missing for several days.

23:38.200 --> 23:39.720
I went to his family's shop
to look for him,

23:40.519 --> 23:41.599
but I didn't see him.

23:42.920 --> 23:44.559
His neighbors said he had gone missing.

23:45.839 --> 23:48.160
His father closed the shop
to look for him everywhere.

23:50.079 --> 23:50.920
Later,

23:52.759 --> 23:55.079
someone found a headless child

23:55.839 --> 23:56.720
behind the stage.

23:57.559 --> 23:58.440
A headless child?

24:00.559 --> 24:01.440
It was chopped off.

24:04.279 --> 24:06.599
That was Qiao Gou'er?

24:09.480 --> 24:10.599
His father recognized him

24:10.599 --> 24:12.279
from his clothes
and the scars on his back.

24:13.599 --> 24:16.920
His father once hit him
with a wooden spoon.

24:18.559 --> 24:19.400
The spoon broke,

24:19.839 --> 24:22.079
(and the wood chips were left
all over his back.)

24:23.039 --> 24:24.519
He showed me his scars.

24:26.119 --> 24:27.599
Today is his death anniversary.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.200
So this incident happened in October.

24:35.720 --> 24:36.960
So, Qiao Gou'er

24:38.960 --> 24:40.759
was not killed at the theater.

24:42.400 --> 24:43.424
Why?

24:46.160 --> 24:47.759
No holidays or festivals.

24:47.960 --> 24:49.200
Other than the market day,

24:49.880 --> 24:51.319
no theatrical troupes will perform.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.640
And no one will be at the theater.

24:57.240 --> 24:59.079
The murderer dumped the body there

24:59.680 --> 25:01.279
for this reason.

25:04.519 --> 25:06.240
I have never thought about this.

25:07.519 --> 25:08.680
Before Qiao Gou'er died,

25:09.559 --> 25:11.119
who saw him last?

25:14.519 --> 25:15.880
It should be his classmates.

25:16.920 --> 25:19.079
His classmate left
with him after school.

25:21.119 --> 25:23.119
We were supposed
to meet and play together.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
He said he would teach me to write,

25:29.240 --> 25:30.559
and he would bring a pen for me.

25:33.400 --> 25:36.599
Which school was he attending before?

25:38.160 --> 25:39.799
His teacher was Mr. Wang.

25:40.519 --> 25:41.359
Wulei School?

25:42.000 --> 25:43.119
Yes.

26:00.720 --> 26:01.680
According to the coroner,

26:02.359 --> 26:04.799
this is the skull of a teenage child.

26:05.200 --> 26:07.480
It's been a long time.

26:09.079 --> 26:10.000
Look.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.319
His occipital bone is broken.

26:12.319 --> 26:14.440
If it's not broken after death,

26:14.440 --> 26:15.599
this boy should be killed

26:15.599 --> 26:18.119
by a heavy blow to the back of the head.

26:19.319 --> 26:20.440
Look at his cervical vertebrae.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.640
There seem to be many marks

26:22.640 --> 26:24.880
of being chopped
by an ax on the cervical vertebrae.

26:25.240 --> 26:28.240
The murderer must have tried many times

26:29.079 --> 26:30.480
before he could chop off the head.

26:31.160 --> 26:32.079
Can this

26:33.039 --> 26:35.160
be used to arrest
and interrogate Mr. Wang?

26:37.400 --> 26:38.720
It's an old case.

26:39.039 --> 26:40.119
If his family doesn't report,

26:40.720 --> 26:42.400
we have no way to start investigating.

26:43.799 --> 26:46.319
So you mean
I should tell Qiao Gou'er's father

26:46.599 --> 26:48.279
about this first?

26:48.680 --> 26:50.200
I suggest you better not go.

26:52.079 --> 26:52.920
Why?

26:53.559 --> 26:56.720
Mr. Wang is influential as a scholar.

26:57.119 --> 26:58.400
Based on this evidence,

26:58.960 --> 27:00.200
you can't charge him.

27:00.200 --> 27:01.599
We can do an autopsy

27:02.240 --> 27:04.160
to compare the fracture on the spine.

27:04.279 --> 27:06.039
Even if you can prove

27:06.039 --> 27:07.200
that this is Qiao Gou'er's skull,

27:07.200 --> 27:08.240
so what?

27:08.559 --> 27:09.799
Mr. Wang can say

27:09.799 --> 27:11.279
he knows nothing about this

27:11.279 --> 27:13.440
and doesn't know
who buried this skull in his yard.

27:13.440 --> 27:14.440
I can testify.

27:14.839 --> 27:16.079
Can you?

27:21.680 --> 27:22.656
It's useless.

27:23.920 --> 27:25.279
Firstly, you're a child.

27:26.279 --> 27:27.136
Secondly...

27:30.440 --> 27:31.640
Secondly, I'm a servant,

27:33.720 --> 27:35.400
a lowly-born kid, right?

27:37.119 --> 27:41.664
That's why I can't
bring down a respected scholar, right?

27:47.680 --> 27:48.576
Lu Zhi,

27:50.799 --> 27:53.279
when you grow up,
you'll understand.

27:53.720 --> 27:54.624
Actually...

27:54.624 --> 27:57.359
So, someone can easily escape punishment

27:58.279 --> 28:00.039
after killing a person?

28:08.640 --> 28:09.568
Mr. Zhong.

28:10.519 --> 28:12.400
I am educated.

28:13.079 --> 28:14.160
I think

28:14.519 --> 28:16.519
the world is not the same
as what's written in the books.

28:16.799 --> 28:18.920
(What is different?)

28:19.440 --> 28:21.039
Books always encourage people
to be good.

28:22.599 --> 28:23.799
But I always feel

28:26.119 --> 28:27.000
it's hard to be good,

28:28.200 --> 28:29.480
but easy to do evil.

28:30.272 --> 28:37.248
(There are few good and evil people.)

28:38.680 --> 28:40.240
Are you saying

28:41.720 --> 28:45.400
that both extremely good
and evil people are rare in this world?

28:46.720 --> 28:47.680
I see.

28:48.319 --> 28:49.839
For me,

28:50.680 --> 28:51.920
you are a good person.

28:52.279 --> 28:53.440
So is Mr. Lu.

28:56.039 --> 28:57.680
Mr. Zhong, Master Lu.

28:57.880 --> 28:59.039
Mr. Lu is looking for you.

29:02.519 --> 29:03.360
mr. Sun.

29:03.640 --> 29:04.839
I think I understand.

29:05.039 --> 29:06.119
What's going on?

29:08.880 --> 29:11.440
The two account books are both
from the Hongshun Textile Mill.

29:12.079 --> 29:13.359
One of them was falsified.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.160
I've read two pages.

29:15.440 --> 29:17.319
It's short of 2,500 taels of silver.

29:21.039 --> 29:22.240
So, what do you think is going on?

29:23.240 --> 29:25.960
Mr. Lu, it involves your friends.

29:26.599 --> 29:27.559
I dare not say.

29:27.759 --> 29:29.119
What's there to be afraid to say?

29:29.720 --> 29:30.640
Say it.

29:30.880 --> 29:33.880
The Hongshun Textile Mill
was co-founded by you and Mr. Zhao.

29:33.960 --> 29:35.759
You hold a 60 percent stake.

29:35.839 --> 29:37.440
Mr. Zhao only has 40 percent.

29:38.640 --> 29:41.480
The manager Tong is appointed
by Mr. Zhao.

29:42.599 --> 29:45.279
The bookkeeper Mr. Li is
from out of town,

29:45.559 --> 29:47.279
saying he was recommended
by someone else,

29:47.519 --> 29:50.160
but in fact, you secretly appointed him

29:51.400 --> 29:52.599
to keep an eye on the accounts.

29:53.160 --> 29:55.160
You often send me on errands.

29:55.160 --> 29:57.000
I have a good understanding

29:57.000 --> 29:58.839
of the people
at the Hongshun Textile Mill.

29:59.640 --> 30:00.680
In my opinion,

30:01.400 --> 30:03.400
the only one
who could skim off this much money

30:05.039 --> 30:06.400
would be Mr. Zhao.

30:07.559 --> 30:10.039
Mr. Zhao must have forced Mr. Li

30:10.680 --> 30:11.839
not to record it in the accounts.

30:12.680 --> 30:15.200
That's why Mr. Li
wrote another account book.

30:17.880 --> 30:18.720
mr. Sun.

30:19.359 --> 30:21.960
This kid is really smart.

30:22.079 --> 30:23.200
I haven't said anything yet,

30:23.200 --> 30:25.000
and you've guessed it all correctly.

30:25.000 --> 30:25.952
mr. Li.

30:26.880 --> 30:28.359
This isn't the first time that Mr. Zhao

30:29.480 --> 30:30.880
has done something like this, right?

30:32.039 --> 30:32.928
Lu Zhi.

30:33.400 --> 30:34.440
Why?

30:36.240 --> 30:37.839
I'm just guessing.

30:38.559 --> 30:41.440
Normally, he should start
with small amounts.

30:41.839 --> 30:43.000
Then, as he gets bolder,

30:43.279 --> 30:44.640
the amounts become larger.

30:45.440 --> 30:46.799
I don't think he started

30:46.799 --> 30:48.920
with 2,500 taels of silver.

30:49.359 --> 30:50.208
Yes.

30:51.480 --> 30:53.279
It has been more than a year.

30:53.880 --> 30:56.759
He's embezzled

30:57.519 --> 30:58.599
4,300 taels of silver.

30:58.599 --> 30:59.552
Lu Zhi.

30:59.960 --> 31:01.640
What do you think
we should do about this?

31:03.640 --> 31:04.544
mr. Sun.

31:05.440 --> 31:07.519
We can't ignore this matter.

31:07.759 --> 31:09.680
Otherwise, Mr. Zhao
will become more brazen.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.960
Reasonably, we can report this
to the authorities.

31:12.160 --> 31:13.056
mr. Sun.

31:13.799 --> 31:15.279
If you can bear this,

31:15.960 --> 31:17.680
you could give Mr. Zhao a warning

31:18.039 --> 31:19.599
and ask him to return the money.

31:19.720 --> 31:20.839
If you can't tolerate it,

31:22.319 --> 31:24.079
you'll have to end the cooperation
with him.

31:24.680 --> 31:25.799
End the cooperation?

31:29.480 --> 31:30.400
Lu Zhi,

31:30.759 --> 31:32.079
you are still too young

31:32.359 --> 31:33.359
and lack experience.

31:34.920 --> 31:36.559
Mr. Zhao

31:36.960 --> 31:37.960
loves pigeons.

31:39.519 --> 31:40.448
Lu Zhong.

31:41.279 --> 31:44.000
Send my pair of pigeons to him

31:44.720 --> 31:46.960
and invite him over for a drink.

31:47.240 --> 31:48.240
Tonight.

31:49.559 --> 31:52.000
Bring Zhang Gui to show him the way.

32:00.839 --> 32:03.119
Mr. Zhao, let me toast you again.

32:09.720 --> 32:10.656
- Master Lu.
- Chen Wang.

32:12.519 --> 32:13.559
Give the liquor to me.

32:16.279 --> 32:18.039
Mr. Zhao got drunk.

32:18.839 --> 32:20.119
He will stay over here.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.279
You tell Ms. Li

32:22.519 --> 32:23.880
to tidy up the guest room.

32:24.480 --> 32:25.408
Okay.

32:28.759 --> 32:29.680
Zhang Gui.

32:29.680 --> 32:30.560
Master Lu.

32:34.119 --> 32:36.240
I was...

32:36.240 --> 32:38.359
You did an errand for Mr. Lu, right?

32:38.480 --> 32:40.400
Yes, you're right.

32:40.720 --> 32:41.960
Did it go well?

32:41.960 --> 32:44.839
Yes. I did it well.

32:45.839 --> 32:46.720
You've worked hard.

32:47.839 --> 32:48.768
By the way,

32:49.279 --> 32:51.559
some aged liquor was left
during the banquet.

32:53.519 --> 32:55.000
I'm keeping a jar of liquor for myself.

32:55.799 --> 32:57.559
Once you two have handled your business,

32:58.400 --> 32:59.240
come and find me.

32:59.240 --> 33:00.400
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

33:05.240 --> 33:06.880
Mr. Zhao, you've been
earning money lately.

33:06.960 --> 33:08.359
What makes you say that?

33:08.359 --> 33:11.000
I heard you're doing
the moneylending business.

33:11.599 --> 33:13.480
That's a lucrative business.

33:15.759 --> 33:17.160
Are you talking about that?

33:19.160 --> 33:21.240
I'm merely working with a partner,

33:21.519 --> 33:22.759
being a silent money backer.

33:24.079 --> 33:25.359
How much interest rate will you get?

33:26.240 --> 33:27.232
4 li per month.

33:28.799 --> 33:30.720
4 li per month?

33:32.519 --> 33:35.839
So, for 4,300 taels of silver,

33:35.839 --> 33:40.288
the monthly interest
will be 172 taels of silver. Good.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.359
You'd earn more than from a shop.

33:44.519 --> 33:46.079
You're quite good at arithmetic.

33:47.759 --> 33:50.839
But no one borrows that much.

33:51.480 --> 33:53.319
Besides,

33:53.319 --> 33:55.720
who can give 4,300 taels of silver?

33:55.720 --> 33:56.799
I can.

33:58.640 --> 33:59.920
Mr. Zhao.

34:01.119 --> 34:03.839
Didn't you borrow 4,300 taels of silver

34:04.680 --> 34:07.200
from the Hongshun Textile Mill?

34:11.360 --> 34:12.480
I was wondering

34:14.519 --> 34:16.800
why you suddenly treated me yesterday.

34:18.800 --> 34:19.680
Well,

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
is it a trap?

34:25.719 --> 34:28.159
If this cup is broken,

34:31.840 --> 34:34.360
will I be killed right now?

34:40.280 --> 34:42.760
Merely 4,300 taels of silver

34:42.760 --> 34:45.320
are nothing to me.

34:47.360 --> 34:51.360
You have no relatives
in Du County, right?

34:52.880 --> 34:54.599
Well, my family

34:54.599 --> 34:57.079
has so many relatives here.

34:57.360 --> 34:59.079
You can't mean to sue me

34:59.079 --> 35:01.199
for such a small amount of money.

35:02.960 --> 35:05.000
What a coincidence.

35:06.679 --> 35:07.760
Just the day before yesterday,

35:08.280 --> 35:09.960
the County Magistrate invited me

35:09.960 --> 35:11.960
to his mansion tomorrow.

35:12.360 --> 35:13.280
So, you can

35:13.800 --> 35:16.000
let the County Magistrate arrest me.

35:18.360 --> 35:19.296
Well...

35:19.960 --> 35:20.896
I almost forgot.

35:21.360 --> 35:22.272
I have a poor memory.

35:24.960 --> 35:27.840
I hold the title of Imperial Scholar.

35:28.079 --> 35:29.119
If you intend to bring me down,

35:29.800 --> 35:30.960
you're going to work harder.

35:32.039 --> 35:33.960
You have to strip my title first.

35:35.559 --> 35:36.559
In this case,

35:38.800 --> 35:40.360
I'm leaving.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.000
Mr. Zhao.

35:43.679 --> 35:45.480
I was merely joking around.

35:45.480 --> 35:46.559
Are you taking it seriously?

35:47.119 --> 35:48.639
Why would I

35:48.639 --> 35:51.760
break off our friendship

35:51.760 --> 35:53.599
for merely 4,300 taels of silver?

35:54.960 --> 35:56.000
Mr. Zhao.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.719
Please sit.

36:01.840 --> 36:05.239
You drank too much last night.

36:05.440 --> 36:06.960
You must be feeling uncomfortable.

36:07.320 --> 36:08.840
I've specifically instructed the chef

36:09.159 --> 36:10.639
to make you a hangover soup.

36:10.840 --> 36:12.079
This soup

36:12.079 --> 36:14.920
is made from the wingtips of a chick,

36:14.920 --> 36:16.920
finely chopped into shreds.

36:16.920 --> 36:19.480
Add spices, scallions, cilantro,

36:19.480 --> 36:22.000
pickled bamboo shoots,
soy sauce and so on.

36:22.559 --> 36:23.840
It's stewed into soup.

36:24.239 --> 36:27.679
It's the best for sobering up
and warming the stomach.

36:29.760 --> 36:31.360
Come on.

36:33.719 --> 36:34.688
Mr. Zhao.

36:35.159 --> 36:36.000
Come on.

36:36.840 --> 36:37.800
Have a try.

36:39.199 --> 36:40.679
Consider it as my apology.

36:53.840 --> 36:54.840
How does it taste?

36:56.239 --> 36:57.184
Delicious.

37:00.320 --> 37:02.000
I can tell

37:02.000 --> 37:04.199
you are still angry with me.

37:04.960 --> 37:07.280
You won't even have a bit more
of the hangover soup

37:07.280 --> 37:08.800
I specifically made for you.

37:10.840 --> 37:11.744
mr. Sun.

37:12.320 --> 37:13.599
Actually, I have been wanting

37:13.840 --> 37:15.599
to discuss this matter with you.

37:16.079 --> 37:18.639
I just couldn't find the right time.

37:18.639 --> 37:21.360
Mr. Zhao, it doesn't matter.

37:22.360 --> 37:24.639
How about this?

37:25.360 --> 37:26.320
Let's drink up this soup.

37:26.679 --> 37:27.599
After this,

37:28.320 --> 37:29.360
we're over it.

37:29.840 --> 37:30.816
What about it?

37:31.599 --> 37:32.480
Good.

37:44.800 --> 37:45.664
mr. Sun.

37:47.039 --> 37:48.639
This soup

37:49.440 --> 37:50.880
is indeed delicious.

37:53.840 --> 37:56.360
By the way, I got caught up
in drinking yesterday.

37:56.840 --> 37:57.840
I forgot to ask you.

37:58.599 --> 37:59.480
The other day,

37:59.480 --> 38:00.840
they gave me a pair of pigeons.

38:01.119 --> 38:04.320
They're called Zihexiu

38:04.840 --> 38:07.400
or called Purple Jade.

38:07.679 --> 38:09.039
I don't know much about pigeons.

38:09.440 --> 38:11.440
So, I sent my man
to deliver them to you.

38:12.039 --> 38:13.199
Do you like them?

38:13.960 --> 38:14.848
Yes.

38:15.159 --> 38:16.880
My man told me about one thing.

38:17.519 --> 38:20.519
You're raising a pair
of valuable pigeons.

38:20.719 --> 38:23.119
You breed them

38:23.320 --> 38:25.000
separately.

38:26.199 --> 38:27.239
What is its name?

38:28.239 --> 38:29.480
It's called Bronze Wing.

38:30.760 --> 38:33.199
So why?

38:34.320 --> 38:35.760
This kind of pigeon

38:36.639 --> 38:39.119
is snow-white all over

38:39.599 --> 38:41.679
except for a pair

38:43.039 --> 38:43.968
of bronze wings.

38:44.599 --> 38:45.559
Well,

38:46.320 --> 38:49.280
the jade bird is inlaid
with purple-gold wings,

38:50.320 --> 38:53.719
half-hidden
by the translucent white clouds.

38:54.679 --> 38:59.320
The jade bird is inlaid
with purple-gold wings.

39:07.320 --> 39:09.039
The hangover soup was made

39:09.960 --> 39:11.719
of bronze wings.

39:13.159 --> 39:14.048
But,

39:14.719 --> 39:15.960
I instructed the cook

39:16.519 --> 39:17.760
to reserve

39:19.159 --> 39:20.096
the feathers.

39:20.320 --> 39:23.639
Look, is this your Bronze Wing?

39:24.079 --> 39:24.992
Lu Yuanbao.

39:26.840 --> 39:28.480
You must be confused.

39:29.280 --> 39:30.559
Before the banquet yesterday,

39:31.199 --> 39:32.679
you had kept your pigeons safely

39:34.440 --> 39:36.480
in your cage.

39:36.480 --> 39:38.719
How did they end up on my dining table?

39:40.320 --> 39:42.320
You were absolutely correct.

39:42.840 --> 39:44.320
I have no power

39:45.440 --> 39:48.280
and no fame.

39:48.840 --> 39:49.824
However,

39:50.599 --> 39:51.840
it's easy for me

39:52.840 --> 39:55.320
to take some living

39:55.320 --> 39:56.400
or dead object

39:56.840 --> 39:59.519
from your house

39:59.960 --> 40:03.320
without leaving any trace.

40:05.960 --> 40:07.960
You don't believe it?

40:09.320 --> 40:10.840
You can hurry home to have a look.

40:11.320 --> 40:12.199
Before leaving,

40:12.840 --> 40:15.679
take your pigeons back with you.

40:23.679 --> 40:25.440
Mr. Lu, I'm wrong.

40:25.440 --> 40:26.840
Don't be mad.

40:28.840 --> 40:29.760
I'll repay the money

40:30.119 --> 40:31.519
within three months.

40:31.760 --> 40:34.159
That's a trivial matter.

40:34.440 --> 40:37.000
It can be deducted
from your future dividends.

40:37.840 --> 40:39.800
But since you insist on this,

40:40.480 --> 40:41.719
I can hardly refuse.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.320
Let's sign a note.

40:45.159 --> 40:46.320
I'll sign it.

40:47.159 --> 40:48.096
I'll sign it.

41:02.960 --> 41:03.872
mr. Sun.

41:04.960 --> 41:06.440
Didn't you say 4,300 taels of silver?

41:06.599 --> 41:08.719
How come it's 5,000 now?

41:10.199 --> 41:11.104
Mr. Zhao.

41:11.320 --> 41:12.639
With our relationship,

41:13.840 --> 41:16.079
I can't possibly accept the interest

41:16.079 --> 41:17.760
of 172 taels of silver.

41:18.480 --> 41:21.400
So, I rounded off the principal
to a full number.

41:21.400 --> 41:22.320
It's easier to remember.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.480
You think it's improper?

41:25.039 --> 41:26.159
- No.
- I can change it.

41:26.159 --> 41:27.559
No, it's fine.

41:27.679 --> 41:28.559
I'll sign it.

41:28.559 --> 41:30.400
Lu Zhi, help Mr. Zhao.

41:40.960 --> 41:41.920
Well,

41:43.960 --> 41:46.599
that jade bird or something?

41:50.719 --> 41:52.639
The jade bird is inlaid
with purple-gold wings.

41:53.400 --> 41:55.320
The jade bird is inlaid
with purple-gold wings.

41:55.599 --> 41:56.760
Purple-gold wings

41:58.000 --> 41:58.880
are gone.

42:01.559 --> 42:02.480
They're gone.

42:28.239 --> 42:29.088
Zhang Gui.

42:29.840 --> 42:30.752
Good for you.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.599
You're not only a watchdog.

42:34.400 --> 42:36.159
You also stole pigeons.

42:37.888 --> 42:38.752
Shiqi.

42:46.880 --> 42:47.744
Master Lu.

42:48.599 --> 42:50.119
This is my senior Liu Shiqi.

42:50.639 --> 42:51.960
He's seriously injured and came to me.

42:51.960 --> 42:53.039
I can't ignore him.

42:53.039 --> 42:53.952
But...

42:55.039 --> 42:57.599
You'll be heavily punished

43:00.199 --> 43:01.320
if Mr. Lu finds out.

43:07.840 --> 43:09.400
It's not a big deal to be punished.

43:09.400 --> 43:10.360
What I fear is...

43:11.760 --> 43:12.719
Master Lu.

43:12.719 --> 43:13.599
To be honest,

43:13.960 --> 43:15.159
my senior is a vagrant.

43:16.159 --> 43:17.360
He committed many crimes.

43:17.840 --> 43:19.320
I fear Mr. Lu will turn him in.

43:22.599 --> 43:24.159
But if we don't turn him in,

43:26.440 --> 43:28.159
we're harboring bandits.

43:31.199 --> 43:32.079
My senior

43:32.440 --> 43:34.199
and I are closer than others.

43:35.159 --> 43:36.096
The two of us

43:38.079 --> 43:39.920
were both expelled by our master.

43:40.960 --> 43:43.159
I don't want
to implicate the Lu family and you.

43:43.840 --> 43:46.199
I want to ask for advice from you.

43:47.519 --> 43:49.840
If you think he can hide here,

43:50.199 --> 43:51.559
I'll let him stay before recovering.

43:52.199 --> 43:53.320
If you think it's inappropriate,

43:53.840 --> 43:55.000
I will take him away now.

43:57.639 --> 43:59.360
Do you have anywhere else to go?

44:00.199 --> 44:01.120
Right now,

44:02.440 --> 44:03.480
I have nowhere to go.

44:04.079 --> 44:05.320
I can't stay in the city.

44:05.880 --> 44:06.784
Zhang Gui.

44:06.880 --> 44:08.320
I appreciate your trust.

44:08.519 --> 44:09.800
I'll surely think of a solution.

44:10.079 --> 44:11.320
But I have to ask

44:11.760 --> 44:13.360
what exactly

44:14.559 --> 44:16.199
does Mr. Liu do?

44:18.599 --> 44:19.679
Liu Shiqi the Ghost Hand.

44:20.159 --> 44:21.360
Kill anyone in an instant.

44:21.840 --> 44:23.079
Whoever is doomed

44:23.440 --> 44:24.639
shall not hide from him.

44:26.559 --> 44:27.599
He's paid

44:27.760 --> 44:29.239
to kill for others.

44:38.880 --> 44:40.079
I shouldn't have asked.

44:41.960 --> 44:43.000
Hiding information

44:43.800 --> 44:45.599
is disloyal to the Lu family.

44:50.440 --> 44:51.960
But if I sold you out,

44:53.719 --> 44:55.559
I'd be betraying your trust in me.

44:56.480 --> 44:57.320
Master Lu.

45:00.679 --> 45:01.568
Never mind.

45:03.360 --> 45:04.840
Regardless of what he does,

45:06.239 --> 45:09.599
I will consider him as your senior.

45:11.280 --> 45:12.159
Master Lu.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.400
Even if we keep this from Mr. Lu,

45:23.199 --> 45:25.480
we won't be able to hide it
from Mr. Zhong.

45:27.239 --> 45:28.239
It's difficult.

45:34.719 --> 45:36.920
We can't tell Mr. Zhong right now.

45:37.800 --> 45:39.000
Let me think about it.

45:40.280 --> 45:41.184
By the way,

45:41.880 --> 45:44.000
the other two guards in your courtyard

45:45.119 --> 45:47.400
once worked in the Escort Agency.

45:48.039 --> 45:48.880
They're difficult.

45:49.599 --> 45:50.960
You mean Bao Sheng and Zhao Liang?

45:52.760 --> 45:53.880
I will definitely be careful.

46:00.320 --> 46:01.800
Thank you so much, Master Lu.

46:04.440 --> 46:05.312
Not at all.

46:05.400 --> 46:07.599
I just ghostwrote a home letter.

46:08.599 --> 46:09.480
See you, Master Lu.

46:13.000 --> 46:14.960
Master Lu, since you're here,

46:14.960 --> 46:16.000
why don't you stay longer?

46:16.800 --> 46:19.639
Zhao Liang, I have errands to run today.

46:20.639 --> 46:22.159
How about tomorrow?

46:22.880 --> 46:24.199
Tomorrow, I'll go to the kitchen

46:24.199 --> 46:25.480
to get a couple of dishes.

46:26.440 --> 46:29.440
I'll drink with you and Bao Sheng.

46:30.440 --> 46:31.920
We should be honored.

46:31.920 --> 46:32.760
Yes.

46:33.280 --> 46:34.920
If you say that, I won't come.

46:35.239 --> 46:36.199
Master Lu.

46:36.199 --> 46:37.639
We'll be waiting for you tomorrow.

46:37.888 --> 46:38.760
Okay.

46:38.760 --> 46:39.616
See you tomorrow.

46:40.320 --> 46:41.248
Take care, Master Lu.

46:43.199 --> 46:46.559
(The three bodyguards are highly paid.)

46:47.800 --> 46:49.400
(Among them, the most expensive one)

46:49.719 --> 46:50.960
(is Zhang Gui.)

46:52.159 --> 46:56.199
(Many martial arts practitioners like
to brag about their masters,)

46:57.239 --> 47:00.199
(but Zhang Gui never does.)

47:11.039 --> 47:11.968
Mr. Zhong.

47:15.679 --> 47:19.519
(Do you know about this?)

47:20.760 --> 47:21.960
I know.

47:23.519 --> 47:25.360
He has been seriously injured.

47:26.360 --> 47:28.400
I haven't figured out
how to tell you about this yet.

47:30.719 --> 47:35.519
(Do you know who he is?)

47:36.800 --> 47:37.664
I know.

47:38.039 --> 47:38.880
Mr. Zhong.

47:39.159 --> 47:42.239
He is the famous Ghost Hand, Liu Shiqi.

47:42.400 --> 47:43.599
He is seriously injured now.

47:43.599 --> 47:45.199
If he could move a little,

47:45.199 --> 47:47.079
we wouldn't dare
to enter this room unarmed.

47:48.039 --> 47:49.760
How dare he hide him in our house.

47:50.440 --> 47:52.239
What is Zhang Gui thinking?

47:52.239 --> 47:53.159
Mr. Zhong.

47:53.159 --> 47:55.119
Calm down, guys.

47:56.239 --> 47:58.360
We are all making a living
in the Lu family.

47:58.679 --> 48:01.400
Yeah, we are paid by Mr. Lu.

48:01.719 --> 48:03.559
So naturally, we can't harbor

48:03.719 --> 48:05.000
a murderer in his house.

48:05.480 --> 48:07.519
You're unhappy
that my salary is higher than yours.

48:08.440 --> 48:10.079
Sadly, your skills are lower than mine.

48:10.239 --> 48:11.840
If you didn't hold a knife to my senior,

48:11.840 --> 48:13.360
how could I let you take me down?

48:13.559 --> 48:14.519
Shut up.

48:15.239 --> 48:16.679
Zhang Gui, stop talking!

48:17.280 --> 48:20.119
There must be a misunderstanding.

48:20.760 --> 48:22.800
Zhang Gui's senior
has been seriously injured.

48:23.119 --> 48:24.320
If it were you two,

48:24.320 --> 48:25.960
you couldn't just watch him die, right?

48:28.000 --> 48:29.480
No matter who he is,

48:30.039 --> 48:31.519
given his serious injury,

48:32.039 --> 48:33.679
he could do nothing now.

48:34.199 --> 48:35.760
Please be merciful.

48:36.920 --> 48:38.360
When he's up and about,

48:39.239 --> 48:40.880
Zhang Gui will send him away.

48:41.679 --> 48:42.800
Master Lu.

48:43.280 --> 48:44.440
After that,

48:44.760 --> 48:46.000
Zhang Gui can be his inside man.

48:46.360 --> 48:48.679
They can rob money together

48:49.000 --> 48:50.840
and kill people in this house.

48:51.079 --> 48:54.039
Master Lu, we've already tied him up

48:54.199 --> 48:55.639
and can't let him go.

48:55.719 --> 48:57.280
We listen to Mr. Zhong.

49:02.599 --> 49:05.920
(What do you think?)

49:06.559 --> 49:08.199
We have to report to Ms. Lu first.

49:09.119 --> 49:11.320
Send Zhang Gui
and Liu Shiqi to the Yamen.

49:14.199 --> 49:15.159
(What about him?)

49:16.400 --> 49:17.280
Master Lu?

49:18.239 --> 49:19.360
Master Lu?

49:20.800 --> 49:22.719
Let Mr. Lu decide.

49:28.559 --> 49:33.599
(You two are very loyal.)

49:34.320 --> 49:36.199
We're doing our job.

49:36.880 --> 49:39.079
(You watch him.)

49:56.667 --> 49:58.962
(No Rush in Penalty)

50:00.872 --> 50:07.144
???In the middle of the bone,
and beside the blade???

50:07.272 --> 50:13.596
???There's something sweet and sticky???

50:15.560 --> 50:21.971
???Biting through the old time???

50:22.120 --> 50:28.162
???Some cry, and some sleep???

50:28.488 --> 50:35.680
???Abundant offerings
are served for sacrifice???

50:35.944 --> 50:43.017
???There are barren mounds,
with flies flying around???

50:43.304 --> 50:50.327
???Remote ancient road
and prosperous city???

50:50.728 --> 51:01.448
???Wild fires never cease,
withering and flourishing???

51:03.656 --> 51:10.050
???A few columns of smoke are curling up???

51:10.050 --> 51:16.546
???You make a wish???

51:18.408 --> 51:24.834
???Empty promises and miserable stories???

51:24.834 --> 51:31.042
???Disappear without trace???

51:31.336 --> 51:38.471
???Abundant offerings
are served for sacrifice???

51:38.664 --> 51:46.056
???There are barren mounds,
with flies flying around???

51:46.120 --> 51:53.352
???Remote ancient road
and prosperous city???

51:53.512 --> 52:00.552
???Wild fires never cease,
withering and flourishing???
