00:36.560 --> 00:38.640
So you know who the killer
is going to kill next

00:39.159 --> 00:41.320
The killer killed Captain Ling first

00:42.159 --> 00:43.840
Then he killed Mr. Wang

00:44.960 --> 00:46.600
He hung Chen Wang's body

00:48.399 --> 00:50.079
After this matter

00:51.159 --> 00:52.600
I believe

00:53.320 --> 00:54.359
That's because it was 20 years ago

00:56.640 --> 00:59.479
It was Captain Ling

01:01.200 --> 01:03.840
It was Mr. Wang

01:05.359 --> 01:07.840
And Chen Wang was Chen Wang

01:10.400 --> 01:11.439
The three people

01:12.319 --> 01:13.760
He never changed their identities

01:20.480 --> 01:22.680
If there is a relationship between them

01:23.719 --> 01:26.680
You'll have to look back on
it 20 years ago

01:29.959 --> 01:31.079
There are two people

01:31.640 --> 01:32.560
Like them

01:33.920 --> 01:36.280
So the killer will kill them next

01:37.799 --> 01:38.719
probably

01:40.200 --> 01:41.120
During the day

01:41.719 --> 01:43.519
I will send two apprentices
to monitor them

01:44.640 --> 01:47.159
At night, it'll be me presenting

01:50.920 --> 01:52.000
Unexpectedly

01:53.000 --> 01:54.120
After 20 years

01:55.439 --> 01:58.519
You still have to climb the roof
at midnight

02:00.680 --> 02:02.879
I doubt whether your sleep clothes

02:03.680 --> 02:04.920
It still suits you

02:05.400 --> 02:07.040
My seniors will definitely be happy

02:16.039 --> 02:17.479
Working people wake up early

02:20.000 --> 02:21.520
You can stay until late

03:19.563 --> 03:23.704
= Rippy Town
== Episode 6 =

03:23.800 --> 03:24.520
Captain Shea

03:25.439 --> 03:27.280
Want to investigate
the revenge of the monkey demon?

03:28.680 --> 03:30.039
Are you serious?

03:30.280 --> 03:30.919
my lord

03:31.879 --> 03:33.879
I dare not joke about the case

03:34.360 --> 03:35.759
According to what they say

03:36.000 --> 03:38.159
Found an old case

03:38.599 --> 03:39.840
although

03:40.199 --> 03:42.000
It seems ridiculous

03:42.000 --> 03:45.280
At this time, we have no suspects

03:45.919 --> 03:48.879
The monkey demon is the only clue

03:48.960 --> 03:50.680
Who could connect Captain Leng

03:51.520 --> 03:52.840
And Mr. Wang

03:55.800 --> 03:56.879
And in this case

03:57.520 --> 03:58.840
You should investigate that

04:00.439 --> 04:01.280
Captain Shea

04:01.680 --> 04:02.560
may I know

04:05.120 --> 04:06.560
What will you start with?

04:08.280 --> 04:09.240
Tell me

04:10.520 --> 04:12.400
Have you seen a monkey demon before?

04:12.840 --> 04:14.240
I did not expect

04:14.840 --> 04:17.040
How dare you sell your magic then?

04:17.240 --> 04:19.399
How do you know your magic
can suppress the monkey demon?

04:19.759 --> 04:20.639
Please allow me to explain

04:20.800 --> 04:22.480
Can resist all demons

04:22.600 --> 04:23.560
Like monkey demons

04:23.759 --> 04:24.920
Dog demons and pig demons

04:24.920 --> 04:25.759
And coral devils and sheep

04:25.759 --> 04:27.560
Even if all the monsters turned into demons

04:27.560 --> 04:28.639
My magic can suppress it

04:31.680 --> 04:32.720
It can suppress monsters

04:32.839 --> 04:34.040
But what about the forest?

04:34.399 --> 04:34.959
Institutions?

04:37.319 --> 04:38.480
I don "t think so

04:38.800 --> 04:40.040
That my magic will work

04:40.759 --> 04:41.720
good

04:42.360 --> 04:45.000
Yamen only has wooden sticks

04:45.000 --> 04:45.800
Somebody!

04:46.079 --> 04:46.800
Hit him

04:48.079 --> 04:50.720
You spread fallacies to deceive people

04:50.879 --> 04:52.680
You made a mess in my house

04:52.680 --> 04:53.720
It made people terrified

04:53.720 --> 04:54.839
Hit him 40 times

04:55.000 --> 04:55.800
Please don't hit me

04:55.800 --> 04:56.680
I must hit you

04:56.920 --> 04:58.079
I know about the monkey demon

04:58.079 --> 04:58.680
to stop

05:05.040 --> 05:05.920
Say what you have

05:08.279 --> 05:09.120
Yes

05:09.439 --> 05:10.000
You...

05:16.439 --> 05:17.439
What are you looking at?

05:17.600 --> 05:18.839
I believe

05:20.240 --> 05:21.279
You have a good look

05:22.079 --> 05:23.319
how dare you

05:23.319 --> 05:25.240
Don't respect me

05:25.439 --> 05:26.160
Hit him!

05:27.759 --> 05:29.040
I make my life by reading face

05:29.160 --> 05:30.319
Sir, you look like my grandmother

05:30.319 --> 05:31.319
Enjoys a high position

05:31.439 --> 05:32.519
And wonderful richness

05:32.519 --> 05:33.720
I was shocked

05:33.839 --> 05:35.120
please forgive me

05:38.160 --> 05:38.759
truly?

05:39.160 --> 05:40.240
I wouldn't dare deceive you

05:47.160 --> 05:48.079
What did you say about me?

05:48.639 --> 05:49.639
my grandmother?

05:53.600 --> 05:55.120
I was asking you

05:55.439 --> 05:57.120
About the demon of monkeys

05:57.120 --> 05:58.240
What's her story?

05:59.279 --> 06:00.000
Understood

06:00.360 --> 06:01.839
Leading to the monkey

06:01.839 --> 06:03.560
And monkey demons in rumors

06:03.560 --> 06:05.319
He was likely from the Virtuous Mother Sect

06:06.040 --> 06:06.800
White Lotus Sect?

06:07.120 --> 06:08.279
You are super knowledgeable

06:08.800 --> 06:10.680
There are many branches of this sect

06:10.800 --> 06:11.800
Including Dacheng

06:11.879 --> 06:13.199
Hunyuan, Xuyuan

06:13.199 --> 06:14.000
etc

06:14.279 --> 06:15.560
Among them, there is a branch

06:15.920 --> 06:16.800
It is called the Wong Sect

06:16.920 --> 06:18.319
This sect is divided into one school

06:18.839 --> 06:20.319
One of them is the primary school

06:20.480 --> 06:22.360
The people in this school are raising and
training monkeys

06:22.600 --> 06:23.720
Most of these

06:23.720 --> 06:25.879
Who perform the monkey show
from elementary school

06:26.360 --> 06:27.800
The other is the ranger school

06:27.959 --> 06:29.040
They're dressed as monkeys

06:29.439 --> 06:30.480
And they jumped

06:30.480 --> 06:31.480
They have some moves

06:32.360 --> 06:34.399
Why do they dress themselves
up as a monkey?

06:34.759 --> 06:35.680
To be spoiled

06:35.839 --> 06:36.600
Just think about it

06:36.759 --> 06:38.279
If they get up to steal at night

06:38.279 --> 06:39.439
And they get arrested

06:39.439 --> 06:40.920
People will be patient

06:41.279 --> 06:42.920
But if people see a creature the size of a man

06:42.920 --> 06:43.920
With shaggy hair

06:44.160 --> 06:45.120
They will be eaten

06:45.399 --> 06:46.480
Who is chasing the thief?

06:53.040 --> 06:54.279
So you mean

06:55.040 --> 06:56.759
Even if the monkey demon existed

06:57.879 --> 06:59.040
Someone pretends to?

06:59.279 --> 07:00.120
Yes

07:01.000 --> 07:01.800
Good

07:01.800 --> 07:03.560
Given your confession

07:08.360 --> 07:09.680
I will be tolerant

07:09.839 --> 07:10.720
Thank you

07:18.680 --> 07:20.399
I can't believe this

07:27.300 --> 07:30.741
(Fortunately)

07:31.319 --> 07:33.040
You believe in the existence
of a monkey demon?

07:38.319 --> 07:38.959
Monkey demon?

07:40.120 --> 07:41.319
I don't know

07:42.279 --> 07:44.519
Well, it wasn't at first

07:45.000 --> 07:46.759
But when magic
is on display all over town

07:47.279 --> 07:48.839
It becomes real

07:55.839 --> 07:58.560
Have you told Mr. Shaw about my work?

07:58.839 --> 08:02.000
Does your work
have anything to do with it?

08:03.399 --> 08:04.720
Think deeply

08:04.879 --> 08:06.680
before answering

08:11.920 --> 08:12.680
this is not true

08:12.920 --> 08:14.879
that is better for you

08:15.120 --> 08:15.759
correct

08:16.240 --> 08:16.920
no

08:21.439 --> 08:22.279
Yes

08:24.040 --> 08:25.079
prescription...

08:25.279 --> 08:26.360
Is there any problem with him?

08:27.079 --> 08:28.240
No issue

08:28.240 --> 08:30.360
If so, then the problem lies with you

08:35.519 --> 08:36.759
Mr. Cheng

08:36.960 --> 08:38.799
You look worried

08:40.399 --> 08:42.440
Are you worried about getting grilled?

08:42.480 --> 08:45.360
Discover the secret of the prescription?

08:47.000 --> 08:48.799
He shouldn't be able to find out

08:49.039 --> 08:50.840
He does not know the medicine

08:51.000 --> 08:52.399
Even an experienced doctor

08:52.559 --> 08:53.960
He won't find the problem

08:53.960 --> 08:56.120
Why not spread the prescription
around town

08:56.120 --> 08:58.200
Make everyone try to find the problem?

09:00.360 --> 09:03.399
If others can't find a problem
with the prescription

09:03.519 --> 09:05.639
They think
it's just a general recipe

09:05.639 --> 09:08.120
Even if Chewie discovered something

09:08.240 --> 09:10.039
No one would believe him, right?

09:17.120 --> 09:18.519
It doesn't matter

09:19.159 --> 09:21.440
Whether magic
can suppress the monkey demon

09:22.120 --> 09:23.799
Whether people believe it or not

09:24.039 --> 09:25.240
Important

09:41.679 --> 09:42.240
with the

09:43.000 --> 09:44.559
When I traveled abroad

09:45.159 --> 09:46.960
Have you heard about the Wong Sect?

09:47.039 --> 09:49.000
That maid didn't lie

09:49.720 --> 09:50.679
the important is

09:51.759 --> 09:52.960
I never dealt with him

09:53.360 --> 09:55.440
If you want to capture this monkey demon

09:55.720 --> 09:57.000
Do you have any solutions?

09:58.240 --> 09:59.679
It's not easy

09:59.840 --> 10:01.200
I should have noticed it secretly

10:02.000 --> 10:02.919
You are doing it now

10:02.919 --> 10:03.480
Good

10:10.759 --> 10:12.360
Xia, Levi San

10:49.039 --> 10:49.759
Mr. Song

10:51.519 --> 10:52.279
Ko Sangg

10:55.720 --> 10:56.639
Has your injury healed?

10:57.240 --> 10:58.080
almost

11:08.039 --> 11:09.120
If I were you

11:10.039 --> 11:11.360
I will rest a few more days at home

11:12.960 --> 11:14.200
At least come back the day after tomorrow

11:15.000 --> 11:15.679
tomorrow?

11:17.559 --> 11:19.480
Tomorrow is the deadline

11:19.559 --> 11:21.360
I heard
they didn't solve a single case

11:22.200 --> 11:23.120
So, why did you come?

11:23.519 --> 11:25.480
Who can they blame
for their incompetence?

11:25.480 --> 11:27.080
They can blame you

11:27.759 --> 11:29.279
Let's place a bet

11:29.480 --> 11:30.159
For what?

11:30.159 --> 11:32.440
Captain Xia will leave soon

11:36.080 --> 11:37.000
What makes you say that?

11:37.360 --> 11:38.440
Are you in or not?

11:41.759 --> 11:42.519
Betting on what?

11:43.320 --> 11:44.399
Ali Ramzi

11:44.799 --> 11:45.639
If you win

11:45.639 --> 11:48.360
You will return my token to me

11:48.799 --> 11:50.240
I don't have your sand

11:50.440 --> 11:51.759
You will have this

11:54.399 --> 11:55.159
Mr. Song

11:55.159 --> 11:56.440
I'm leaving

12:03.840 --> 12:04.519
They arrested him

12:04.519 --> 12:05.080
Yes

12:06.559 --> 12:07.399
what is going on?

12:08.519 --> 12:09.279
Mr. Shi

12:10.360 --> 12:12.080
Have these prescriptions been checked?

12:12.720 --> 12:13.279
my lord

12:13.840 --> 12:15.919
Five doctors
and three pharmacies reviewed them

12:16.159 --> 12:17.080
Nothing wrong

12:19.559 --> 12:20.360
Ko Sangg

12:21.360 --> 12:22.240
Do you plead guilty?

12:22.360 --> 12:23.360
no

12:25.200 --> 12:27.039
You must be hit

12:27.799 --> 12:31.159
I pestered Dr. Cheng
with old prescriptions

12:31.159 --> 12:33.440
And you blackmailed him

12:34.759 --> 12:35.519
Mr. Song

12:36.320 --> 12:37.440
What is his punishment?

12:38.440 --> 12:39.919
If blackmail is confirmed

12:39.919 --> 12:40.960
He must be whipped 60 times

12:41.120 --> 12:42.039
Heavier sentence

12:42.399 --> 12:44.519
It could be a year

12:44.679 --> 12:45.440
From penal slavery

12:46.200 --> 12:48.039
I didn't blackmail anyone

12:51.679 --> 12:54.279
Tamlin took the silver from me

12:55.120 --> 12:56.799
Do you remember clearly?

12:57.440 --> 12:58.799
naturally

12:59.039 --> 13:01.360
After you visit a sick person

13:01.360 --> 13:04.240
I got a tael of silver

13:04.440 --> 13:05.399
Do you speak

13:05.399 --> 13:07.240
About what happened
on the 27th of this month?

13:11.360 --> 13:12.120
exactly

13:12.679 --> 13:14.519
I am a doctor after all

13:14.519 --> 13:17.080
Why would I falsely accuse someone of conservatism?

13:17.240 --> 13:18.440
exactly

13:19.519 --> 13:21.080
Mr. Cheng, please sit down

13:22.519 --> 13:24.759
Mr. Cheng said so

13:24.759 --> 13:26.200
She blackmailed him

13:26.440 --> 13:27.639
He is a famous doctor

13:27.799 --> 13:28.919
Why is he framing you?

13:29.080 --> 13:30.919
I did not mean that

13:31.360 --> 13:33.960
Mr. Cheng is busy dating patients

13:33.960 --> 13:35.360
He may remember this wrong

13:35.600 --> 13:36.440
How dare you argue?

13:37.440 --> 13:38.080
Hey person!

13:38.440 --> 13:39.399
And withdraw and multiply by

13:39.759 --> 13:40.279
I am waiting

13:40.519 --> 13:41.120
my lord

13:41.559 --> 13:42.919
Let him finish talking

13:44.480 --> 13:46.200
Let's hear
how he continues his fabrication

13:47.080 --> 13:47.639
Good

13:50.559 --> 13:52.279
Chewie, keep up your lies

13:53.159 --> 13:54.480
I don't dare lie

13:56.200 --> 13:58.240
That day, I went to see Mr. Cheng

13:58.559 --> 14:00.159
I used some powders

14:00.960 --> 14:02.200
The captain would be a fool

14:02.360 --> 14:04.159
When dealing with issues

14:04.360 --> 14:05.879
Don't talk nonsense

14:06.240 --> 14:08.639
Just tell me if you take the money

14:08.639 --> 14:09.240
Okay

14:11.879 --> 14:14.519
But Mr. Cheng gave it to me

14:14.919 --> 14:16.000
You're talking nonsense

14:16.559 --> 14:17.799
not me

14:18.039 --> 14:19.039
I have proof

14:20.440 --> 14:22.080
No gains without pains

14:22.720 --> 14:24.320
After I received the reward
from Mr. Cheng

14:24.320 --> 14:25.480
I felt uncomfortable

14:26.039 --> 14:26.919
So today

14:27.200 --> 14:29.480
Donated a silver petal

14:29.480 --> 14:31.679
To a temple

14:32.480 --> 14:34.559
This was recorded in the book of merit

14:35.039 --> 14:37.240
I watched a Taoist write that

14:37.480 --> 14:40.320
Two tales of silver

14:40.759 --> 14:41.600
From choy

14:42.480 --> 14:44.240
Since I got the money

14:44.639 --> 14:46.039
From Mr. Cheng

14:46.159 --> 14:48.720
I shouldn't have a monopoly on merit

14:48.960 --> 14:52.240
So I specifically asked the Taoist
to add Cheng Yiqi's name

14:52.440 --> 14:54.639
To the book of entitlement

14:55.320 --> 14:56.360
You can find it

14:57.000 --> 14:59.960
In the book of merit

15:07.799 --> 15:09.799
It's a misunderstanding

15:09.799 --> 15:10.519
Ko Sanqing

15:11.000 --> 15:13.399
Your service was clumsy

15:13.679 --> 15:14.639
Make Mr. Cheng

15:14.639 --> 15:16.360
I missed you

15:17.960 --> 15:19.360
I think so

15:19.639 --> 15:21.320
I am not clear

15:21.519 --> 15:22.440
And slow to understand

15:23.639 --> 15:25.679
I apologize to you, Mr. Cheng

15:27.720 --> 15:28.440
I misunderstood you

15:28.799 --> 15:29.399
Okay

15:29.840 --> 15:30.960
It's a misunderstanding

15:33.080 --> 15:35.159
Mr. Cheng, don't feel so guilty

15:36.679 --> 15:39.559
Ko Sanqing is a stubborn man

15:40.360 --> 15:43.279
He deserves a lesson
for teasing you over and over again

15:45.240 --> 15:46.000
Ko Sanqing

15:48.639 --> 15:50.200
The prescription has been checked

15:50.200 --> 15:51.320
And check it

15:51.919 --> 15:53.159
It's time to surrender

15:53.440 --> 15:54.679
Yes sir

16:09.279 --> 16:10.320
it is delicious

16:11.039 --> 16:11.759
Do you buy less?

16:13.720 --> 16:14.360
my lord

16:14.679 --> 16:15.639
I want tears, please

16:15.639 --> 16:16.279
Good

16:21.559 --> 16:22.720
Take more of it

16:45.360 --> 16:45.960
Five days

16:47.039 --> 16:48.480
Five full days

16:49.080 --> 16:50.519
Not a single case has been solved

16:51.639 --> 16:52.519
permission

16:53.679 --> 16:55.879
I do not know what to say

16:57.279 --> 16:59.039
Let the skin do the talking for me

16:59.759 --> 17:01.080
Each of them is beaten ten times

17:01.960 --> 17:03.000
Enforcers squad

17:03.799 --> 17:05.200
Do it honestly

17:06.960 --> 17:08.240
And

17:09.960 --> 17:10.759
Ko Sanqing

17:11.519 --> 17:12.799
You're standing there

17:13.440 --> 17:14.400
You trust him

17:15.559 --> 17:16.160
Let's go

17:17.799 --> 17:18.440
Raise the stick

17:22.839 --> 17:23.359
One

17:24.839 --> 17:25.359
two

17:26.599 --> 17:27.160
three

17:28.079 --> 17:28.640
to stop

17:32.079 --> 17:34.119
Who can hear such a weak voice?

17:34.960 --> 17:35.519
Do it again

17:36.319 --> 17:36.880
four

17:37.920 --> 17:38.440
to stop

17:39.079 --> 17:41.160
"Do that again," I said.

17:42.319 --> 17:43.519
Adi from the beginning

17:47.519 --> 17:48.319
My bedding

17:48.319 --> 17:48.759
again

17:48.759 --> 17:49.680
I will swear to you

17:49.759 --> 17:50.279
One

17:51.680 --> 17:52.240
two

17:53.400 --> 17:53.960
three

17:54.839 --> 17:55.400
to stop

18:09.319 --> 18:11.839
You are useless

18:13.480 --> 18:15.119
Your voice is not
as loud as the sound of skin

18:16.079 --> 18:18.720
Won't it make them get beaten up more?

18:23.839 --> 18:25.000
Cry with his knee

18:25.759 --> 18:27.559
Just like you did
at your father's funeral

18:30.640 --> 18:31.240
again

18:43.680 --> 18:44.400
One

18:46.519 --> 18:47.359
two

18:49.079 --> 18:49.960
three

18:51.519 --> 18:52.440
four

18:54.039 --> 18:54.960
five

18:56.359 --> 18:57.200
six

18:58.640 --> 18:59.480
Seven

19:00.880 --> 19:01.720
eight

19:03.200 --> 19:04.160
nine

19:04.960 --> 19:05.880
Three

19:15.519 --> 19:16.319
I finish

19:26.039 --> 19:27.079
Five of you

19:27.960 --> 19:29.000
They are the worst

19:30.480 --> 19:32.359
At least the others found something

19:33.480 --> 19:34.119
you all

19:35.079 --> 19:36.519
nothing

19:38.240 --> 19:39.319
Five more times

19:41.079 --> 19:42.079
What about this?

19:42.079 --> 19:43.000
Not all of you

19:43.400 --> 19:44.400
You must be punished

19:45.359 --> 19:46.240
choose one

19:46.880 --> 19:47.640
Ko Sanqing

19:56.640 --> 19:57.559
Who do you think?

19:58.759 --> 19:59.519
Should he be beaten?

20:00.680 --> 20:01.839
If you can't choose anyone

20:03.279 --> 20:04.839
Five of them will be multiplied together

20:07.359 --> 20:08.119
hit me

20:12.480 --> 20:13.200
hit me

20:14.319 --> 20:15.799
They are in trouble because of me

20:16.519 --> 20:17.240
hit me

20:17.559 --> 20:18.279
good

20:18.920 --> 20:19.640
A loyal man

20:20.680 --> 20:21.759
Everyone can go

20:27.279 --> 20:28.039
Ko Sanqing

20:30.119 --> 20:30.880
you do that

20:33.079 --> 20:33.839
Captain Shea

20:34.960 --> 20:36.279
I'm from the hustler band

20:37.279 --> 20:38.279
I can't do that

20:43.400 --> 20:44.440
You're from the Hounds

20:45.240 --> 20:46.480
You can not do that

20:47.240 --> 20:48.880
But you can't catch thieves either

20:50.759 --> 20:51.440
Tell me

20:52.720 --> 20:54.359
What can you do?

20:55.200 --> 20:55.839
Sangang

20:57.000 --> 20:57.720
Help yourself

20:58.759 --> 20:59.759
I have prepared the medicine

21:01.240 --> 21:02.000
Don't worry

21:07.920 --> 21:08.640
Hit this side

21:18.440 --> 21:19.519
They gave him

21:20.160 --> 21:20.960
With all

21:22.519 --> 21:23.240
Your strength

21:35.039 --> 21:35.880
One

21:48.400 --> 21:49.119
Ko Sanqing

21:49.519 --> 21:50.359
You are useless

21:50.880 --> 21:51.880
Can't you even do that?

21:52.599 --> 21:53.519
I accidentally hurt him

21:53.880 --> 21:55.279
Get off him

21:55.480 --> 21:56.279
He gave it 20 times

21:59.960 --> 22:01.640
Captain Xia, are you okay?

22:01.640 --> 22:02.920
Come here

22:03.160 --> 22:04.720
Captain Shea helped him up

22:05.000 --> 22:05.880
Get a doctor for him

22:08.440 --> 22:09.039
I am waiting

22:10.240 --> 22:11.440
Did he do it by mistake?

22:11.759 --> 22:13.440
He obviously did it on purpose

22:13.839 --> 22:15.920
I'm his boss, and he beat me up

22:16.119 --> 22:17.519
This is taboo in the two days

22:17.920 --> 22:19.240
Blinded him 20 times?

22:19.240 --> 22:21.160
Today, I must kill this man

22:21.279 --> 22:21.960
Somebody!

22:21.960 --> 22:23.000
Beat him to death

22:23.359 --> 22:25.640
Don't stop if I don't stop

22:26.000 --> 22:26.759
Captain Shea

22:26.759 --> 22:27.839
just chill

22:28.119 --> 22:29.160
He can't run

22:30.039 --> 22:31.440
You need to treat your injury first

22:31.759 --> 22:33.240
Deal with it later

22:33.240 --> 22:34.440
silent

22:35.039 --> 22:36.000
Later?

22:36.240 --> 22:37.759
Obviously to protect him

22:38.160 --> 22:39.599
Yamin District of Dou

22:40.079 --> 22:41.119
He neglects his duties

22:41.359 --> 22:42.400
People are not united

22:42.759 --> 22:43.640
Since I came here

22:44.079 --> 22:45.599
You were impeding my movement

22:46.200 --> 22:46.880
today

22:47.480 --> 22:49.920
Even your intimate partner hurt me

22:50.759 --> 22:51.359
permission

22:51.960 --> 22:54.279
I will definitely report
to the Inspector General

22:55.160 --> 22:55.839
You...

22:56.799 --> 22:59.480
You cannot escape responsibility

23:02.279 --> 23:04.079
I will kill him today

23:04.200 --> 23:05.599
If you stop me again

23:06.400 --> 23:07.920
You will be charged

23:08.720 --> 23:10.160
By neglecting duties

23:12.200 --> 23:12.960
Captain Shea

23:13.759 --> 23:15.640
You were complaining
to Choi about his superiors' disrespect

23:16.359 --> 23:18.160
Who doesn't respect bosses now?

23:21.480 --> 23:22.119
I

23:23.000 --> 23:24.640
Senior Class Officer
of Nitai Yamin

23:26.000 --> 23:26.519
While you

23:28.119 --> 23:29.279
Just a district judge Yamin

23:29.759 --> 23:32.279
Low official

23:32.400 --> 23:34.240
Can you show off your formal strength
in front of me?

23:34.839 --> 23:35.960
This county do

23:36.759 --> 23:38.279
Really strange

23:38.759 --> 23:41.960
I can't believe
they used a disabled man

23:42.400 --> 23:43.640
As a judge

23:44.400 --> 23:45.119
Mr. Song

23:45.359 --> 23:48.279
Just to be responsible

23:48.279 --> 23:50.400
You must have spent
a lot of money, right?

23:50.400 --> 23:51.400
how dare you!

23:56.640 --> 23:58.400
you fool

23:58.880 --> 24:01.279
Just like a prostitute

24:01.400 --> 24:02.039
Do...

24:02.039 --> 24:04.240
How dare you insult a judge?

24:05.000 --> 24:07.039
It's terrible

24:07.720 --> 24:09.480
According to the law
I will catch you now

24:09.960 --> 24:10.519
the person!

24:11.039 --> 24:12.119
They arrested him

24:12.400 --> 24:13.759
He was placed in detention

24:13.880 --> 24:15.519
Licensed to me by Nitai Yamin

24:15.640 --> 24:16.920
Who dares to contact me?

24:20.039 --> 24:20.759
both of you

24:20.759 --> 24:22.400
just chill

24:22.839 --> 24:23.759
Everything happened here

24:23.759 --> 24:26.039
It was reported
to the district judge

24:26.279 --> 24:28.799
Unfortunately, not so well

24:29.000 --> 24:30.640
So, he asked me to pass a message

24:33.039 --> 24:34.200
Su Sanqing

24:34.960 --> 24:36.240
Whether it was a serious accident

24:37.000 --> 24:38.160
Or intentionally

24:38.279 --> 24:40.000
Captain Shea was injured

24:40.440 --> 24:43.000
He blinded him 30 times
and then imprisoned him

24:43.400 --> 24:44.720
When the judge feels unwell

24:44.880 --> 24:46.000
He will be questioned and judged

24:49.000 --> 24:49.680
Mr. Song

24:50.119 --> 24:51.759
This is the leadership
of the district judge

24:52.000 --> 24:53.160
If you have more grievances

24:53.400 --> 24:54.920
Please find it another day

24:56.759 --> 24:57.519
Captain Shea

24:57.839 --> 25:00.279
After all this is Do Yamin County

25:00.599 --> 25:01.759
Since the judge has spoken

25:02.200 --> 25:04.880
Please bear your anger

25:07.160 --> 25:07.839
Captain Shea

25:08.440 --> 25:09.240
Are you well?

25:10.279 --> 25:11.000
Captain Shea

25:13.880 --> 25:14.519
Captain Shea

25:18.039 --> 25:18.759
Somebody!

25:19.039 --> 25:20.720
Captain Shea helped into the room

25:22.279 --> 25:23.039
Captain Shea

25:23.920 --> 25:24.759
Sorry about this

25:25.640 --> 25:27.000
I will accompany you

25:27.279 --> 25:28.400
the doctor

25:28.519 --> 25:29.519
It will be here soon

25:30.400 --> 25:31.000
Please

25:44.640 --> 25:45.680
What are you waiting for?

25:45.759 --> 25:46.920
Didn't I just say that?

25:46.920 --> 25:48.000
He blinded him 30 times

25:48.640 --> 25:49.720
Just do it

26:01.480 --> 26:02.359
now

26:02.880 --> 26:03.400
Hit him

26:04.319 --> 26:05.200
Hit him hard

26:11.599 --> 26:13.160
Ku Sanqing, you idiot

26:13.839 --> 26:15.359
He was clearly deceiving you on purpose

26:15.720 --> 26:17.079
To make you behave inappropriately

26:17.759 --> 26:19.160
So he will have a reason to deal with you

26:19.880 --> 26:20.720
Know

26:22.440 --> 26:23.119
to stop

26:24.000 --> 26:25.400
I was doing it on purpose too

26:26.599 --> 26:27.319
What did you say?

26:28.079 --> 26:28.920
There is one thing

26:30.240 --> 26:32.599
I can't do that unless he does this to me

26:34.039 --> 26:35.160
I will go to prison

26:35.960 --> 26:36.759
Mr. Song

26:42.240 --> 26:43.799
Please keep the code for me

26:45.160 --> 26:46.160
Captain Shea

26:48.119 --> 26:51.599
I advise you not to
get angry with Mr. Song

26:54.359 --> 26:55.119
Mr. Shi

26:55.759 --> 26:56.960
I don't understand

26:57.440 --> 27:00.960
People with disabilities usually cannot work
as a government official

27:01.400 --> 27:02.640
Song Chen...

27:03.000 --> 27:04.440
Song Chen

27:05.519 --> 27:07.279
He has not been appointed by this county

27:08.599 --> 27:11.240
Nor the Ministry of Personnel Affairs

27:12.440 --> 27:17.599
Appointed by His Majesty the Emperor

27:19.680 --> 27:20.359
What?

27:21.720 --> 27:22.960
Is this correct?

27:24.160 --> 27:26.640
Have you ever heard
of cheating in an exam ?

27:27.359 --> 27:29.880
In the Heyuan exam
more than ten years ago?

27:32.799 --> 27:34.200
I am not a scientist

27:34.200 --> 27:36.000
I do not know that

27:36.519 --> 27:37.359
About that

27:39.559 --> 27:40.920
That case is still new

27:42.079 --> 27:43.759
In my memory

27:45.039 --> 27:46.039
More than ten years ago

27:46.480 --> 27:48.720
There was a remarkable talent known

27:49.759 --> 27:52.319
In Jiangnan, Song's name is Zhongqiu

27:52.880 --> 27:54.119
Song Zhongqiu?

27:55.920 --> 27:56.680
I know him

27:57.559 --> 28:00.559
His plans
and paintings are very valuable

28:01.920 --> 28:02.759
Yes

28:03.839 --> 28:04.880
This is because

28:05.599 --> 28:07.039
Can't paint

28:07.599 --> 28:08.759
And write anymore

28:10.599 --> 28:12.680
Why? did he die?

28:13.200 --> 28:14.240
His right hand

28:14.599 --> 28:16.000
There are only two fingers left

28:16.680 --> 28:17.559
He has a disability

28:19.160 --> 28:21.960
Do you mean that
Song Chen is Song Zhongqiu?

28:25.319 --> 28:26.079
Song Chen

28:27.279 --> 28:28.160
His name is also Song Zhongqiu

28:29.400 --> 28:31.160
He earned the title
at an early age

28:32.160 --> 28:33.519
He passed the scientific examination at the age of 16 years

28:34.000 --> 28:36.160
Ranked first
in the regional exam at nineteen

28:36.480 --> 28:37.440
As Jie Yuan

28:38.559 --> 28:40.319
He attended the imperial examination
on the 28th

28:40.680 --> 28:42.160
It came in first place

28:42.720 --> 28:43.599
He Huo Yuan

28:44.160 --> 28:45.200
People said

28:45.640 --> 28:46.759
It was most likely

28:47.279 --> 28:48.680
To be first
in the final exam

28:49.119 --> 28:51.359
But before the final imperial examination

28:51.799 --> 28:53.519
Thrown in prison

28:54.599 --> 28:56.039
Did he cheat on the exam?

28:56.039 --> 28:57.920
It was just a political conspiracy

28:58.480 --> 28:59.799
exam at that time

29:00.079 --> 29:01.000
It was very difficult

29:01.400 --> 29:02.319
but

29:02.519 --> 29:04.680
Song Chen

29:05.359 --> 29:07.799
And his friend did well

29:08.000 --> 29:11.039
They visited the chief examiner
before the exam together

29:11.519 --> 29:13.240
Gave a bribe at that time?

29:15.519 --> 29:17.200
A visit by the chief examiner was common

29:17.519 --> 29:19.079
Most examiners will do this

29:19.559 --> 29:20.759
However, Sgt

29:21.160 --> 29:22.920
Be a political enemy
of the chief examiner

29:23.359 --> 29:24.640
Use this as an excuse

29:24.920 --> 29:27.519
The chief examiner was accused
of accepting bribes

29:29.480 --> 29:30.319
Any evidence?

29:30.519 --> 29:31.880
This does not require any evidence

29:32.720 --> 29:34.000
If His Majesty the King investigates the matter

29:34.480 --> 29:36.200
Officials will arrest the suspect first

29:36.599 --> 29:37.720
Then they look for evidence

29:38.559 --> 29:40.440
I did not expect that they dealt with the issues

29:41.359 --> 29:42.839
As we do

29:43.680 --> 29:45.920
Dong Chen
was severely tortured in prison

29:46.599 --> 29:47.880
as a result

29:48.319 --> 29:49.720
He became disabled

29:51.559 --> 29:53.480
In the end, he was tortured
into confessing

29:54.200 --> 29:55.559
That's the chief examiner

29:55.920 --> 29:57.680
He leaked the test questions
to him and his friend

29:59.079 --> 30:00.359
This is a serious crime

30:01.960 --> 30:03.519
Shortly thereafter

30:04.240 --> 30:06.279
The Royal Court overturned the case

30:07.720 --> 30:08.960
this fast

30:09.559 --> 30:11.559
This is the political struggle

30:12.720 --> 30:15.480
The chief examiner is more powerful

30:16.680 --> 30:17.839
But Song Chen

30:18.960 --> 30:20.279
He has already been dismissed from his honor

30:21.279 --> 30:22.400
And accountability

30:22.640 --> 30:23.880
About his bad behavior before the exam

30:24.319 --> 30:26.559
His friend noted in his confession

30:27.359 --> 30:28.640
He committed suicide by hanging himself

30:31.720 --> 30:32.519
And later

30:33.480 --> 30:35.119
His Majesty the King issued a decree

30:35.519 --> 30:37.119
Below the level of district judge

30:37.240 --> 30:40.519
He can choose jobs like assistant
and

30:41.599 --> 30:44.279
But he chose to be a judge

30:45.079 --> 30:45.920
why is that?

30:46.640 --> 30:47.519
Some people say

30:48.559 --> 30:50.240
Take all harsh punishments

30:50.759 --> 30:51.920
in prison

30:54.160 --> 30:55.160
Gain a lot of visibility

30:56.880 --> 30:57.759
He is determined

30:58.799 --> 31:00.000
To apply what you have learned

31:02.559 --> 31:06.400
Song Chen is an official appointed
by His Majesty the Emperor

31:07.640 --> 31:09.039
Even though he's just a judge

31:09.960 --> 31:12.799
The salary he gets is...
from a fifth-rank official

31:15.119 --> 31:17.240
He earns more
than a district judge

31:18.960 --> 31:19.960
But every month

31:20.440 --> 31:22.400
He only receives a judge's salary

31:22.799 --> 31:24.119
And the penis never takes more

31:33.599 --> 31:34.480
What is this?

31:36.039 --> 31:36.880
Yazi

31:38.720 --> 31:39.720
What is yi?

31:43.799 --> 31:45.160
Yanzi is kind of cruel

31:48.279 --> 31:49.839
A revengeable monster

31:57.440 --> 31:58.240
Captain Shea

31:59.039 --> 32:01.680
Calm down your anger

32:02.319 --> 32:03.559
permission

32:04.160 --> 32:05.000
let him go

32:21.559 --> 32:23.160
Your prophet

32:24.559 --> 32:25.880
It tastes very good

32:29.960 --> 32:32.279
But it's expensive

32:32.279 --> 32:35.279
No wonder you don't always drink here

32:41.039 --> 32:41.839
Mr. Song

32:42.160 --> 32:43.039
today

32:43.559 --> 32:45.440
Are you upset about something?

32:46.400 --> 32:47.599
As long as I'm alive

32:51.920 --> 32:53.400
I'm bound to be upset

33:00.599 --> 33:01.279
Chunkh

33:02.240 --> 33:02.960
Pour the wine

33:03.559 --> 33:04.319
Mr. Song

33:04.880 --> 33:05.960
You shouldn't just drink

33:06.480 --> 33:08.000
Eat some food too

33:09.599 --> 33:10.359
I've eaten

33:11.519 --> 33:12.920
But you haven't eaten yet

33:20.920 --> 33:23.119
I was filled with anger

33:24.200 --> 33:25.359
For wine

33:27.079 --> 33:27.880
Mr. Song

33:28.400 --> 33:29.559
Do you like to listen to music?

33:31.359 --> 33:32.359
naturally

33:33.880 --> 33:34.960
But when did you learn?

33:36.480 --> 33:38.400
To sing?

33:39.880 --> 33:41.240
I can not sing

33:41.480 --> 33:43.279
But Yuno can

33:45.680 --> 33:46.880
I can't bear it

33:46.880 --> 33:47.799
Listen to her songs

33:48.799 --> 33:50.279
I'm not accusing you

33:50.440 --> 33:51.920
It's on me

33:52.240 --> 33:52.920
Mr. Song

33:53.359 --> 33:54.839
come with me

33:59.720 --> 34:00.599
here

34:08.440 --> 34:10.280
Her room is next door

34:11.320 --> 34:12.480
And open the window

34:12.480 --> 34:14.119
You can hear her singing clearly here

34:41.519 --> 34:43.159
Without any customers

34:43.800 --> 34:45.320
I often come here

34:45.519 --> 34:46.760
Listen to her

34:51.280 --> 34:51.880
I listen

34:52.960 --> 34:53.719
She's about to sing

34:55.288 --> 35:03.248
♪ There is a curse on the dried lotus ♪

35:03.256 --> 35:07.968
♪ Fragrance attracts butterflies ♪

35:07.968 --> 35:12.267

35:12.267 --> 35:16.875

35:16.875 --> 35:21.120

36:01.559 --> 36:02.360
Mr. Song

36:02.679 --> 36:04.039
I'll bring you more liquor

36:06.599 --> 36:07.840
I should have asked

36:08.440 --> 36:09.400
Whether you want to drink more

36:18.000 --> 36:19.760
Are you worried that I can't handle it?

36:21.960 --> 36:22.559
no

37:01.719 --> 37:03.519
I didn't listen to the songs

37:05.880 --> 37:07.039
For 12 years

37:08.840 --> 37:11.800
I live in prison

37:14.000 --> 37:16.320
Don't say I'm famous

37:26.000 --> 37:27.519
Who would think I don't even have money

37:31.599 --> 37:32.719
For wine?

37:37.960 --> 37:38.679
Mr. Song

37:40.920 --> 37:42.239
Are you making up a poem?

37:43.199 --> 37:44.639
I haven't seen you for a long time since the last time

37:48.360 --> 37:49.119
Write it down

37:50.519 --> 37:51.800
let's write

37:57.400 --> 37:59.199
Your calligraphy is very beautiful

38:00.199 --> 38:00.960
no not like that

38:01.480 --> 38:02.239
truly?

38:06.599 --> 38:07.880
Characters written with my left hand

38:10.480 --> 38:11.800
It is Mr. Song's family

38:12.639 --> 38:14.039
And not the king of Song Chen

38:15.320 --> 38:16.599
I must write with my right hand

40:20.599 --> 40:21.880
This is my handwriting

40:28.400 --> 40:29.599
This is my handwriting

40:44.559 --> 40:45.960
You're working hard these days

40:46.599 --> 40:47.960
You should get some sleep

40:49.440 --> 40:50.599
The older ones seem more lively to me

40:50.599 --> 40:51.800
I can't let myself be lazy

40:53.159 --> 40:54.760
Why are you here?

40:56.039 --> 40:56.920
Make two people

40:57.480 --> 40:59.039
And you're watching

41:00.400 --> 41:01.880
Have there been any movements?

41:02.960 --> 41:05.760
The elderly and I saw a big monkey

41:07.440 --> 41:08.599
monkey?

41:09.760 --> 41:10.920
A thief from the Wong sect

41:11.079 --> 41:12.239
strange

41:12.840 --> 41:14.599
He always seemed close to us

41:15.199 --> 41:16.199
Did he notice you?

41:16.840 --> 41:17.800
I do not think so

41:19.000 --> 41:20.280
what did he do?

41:20.559 --> 41:21.320
He's a thief

41:21.840 --> 41:22.719
Stealing things

41:23.960 --> 41:25.719
It must be targeted by us

41:29.960 --> 41:31.199
Otherwise, it's a coincidence

41:39.400 --> 41:41.800
You must speak frankly

41:42.519 --> 41:43.320
These days

41:44.079 --> 41:45.840
I have visited more than 200 families

41:46.599 --> 41:48.239
Along this river

41:49.800 --> 41:51.599
Rumors about the monkey demon

41:53.400 --> 41:54.239
It came from you

41:55.039 --> 41:55.960
I don't dare lie

41:56.280 --> 41:57.719
I already saw the monkey demon

41:59.239 --> 42:00.280
That night when I woke up

42:00.440 --> 42:02.079
I saw the monkey demon from this window

42:07.599 --> 42:08.599
What does it look like to you?

42:09.039 --> 42:10.519
It's a very big monkey

42:10.880 --> 42:11.480
permission

42:12.559 --> 42:13.559
He's bigger than you

42:14.760 --> 42:15.440
how dare you?

42:15.840 --> 42:16.719
I'm sorry

42:16.920 --> 42:17.880
I mean

42:18.079 --> 42:19.519
That monkey is bigger
than the average man

42:19.800 --> 42:20.599
Covered in fur

42:20.599 --> 42:21.920
Squatters on the other side

42:25.239 --> 42:26.519
What was he doing?

42:26.840 --> 42:27.519
Crushing the moon

42:27.599 --> 42:28.199
What?

42:28.400 --> 42:29.599
He's really catching the moon

42:29.599 --> 42:30.239
With his hand

42:30.480 --> 42:32.079
No, with its exits

43:06.480 --> 43:07.440
Capture the moon

43:08.840 --> 43:10.079
Since I saw him

43:10.079 --> 43:11.599
Why didn't you catch him?

43:12.039 --> 43:13.599
Monkey Demon costume and moves

43:13.599 --> 43:15.719
Derived from a branch
of the Wong sect

43:15.719 --> 43:16.800
Up to Dacheng level

43:16.800 --> 43:18.880
I wasn't sure if I could catch him

43:19.039 --> 43:20.079
So I didn't act quickly

43:20.079 --> 43:21.159
You should have followed her

43:21.159 --> 43:22.599
To learn about Lao

43:22.599 --> 43:23.239
Captain Shea

43:23.480 --> 43:25.079
It's not easy

43:25.079 --> 43:26.360
A person's tail at night

43:26.360 --> 43:27.519
It is very easy to detect

43:27.519 --> 43:29.599
What if I saved him?

43:31.840 --> 43:32.920
Don't worry

43:33.320 --> 43:34.199
I planned everything

43:34.400 --> 43:35.480
We don't have to ambush

43:35.599 --> 43:37.079
About his nights

43:37.079 --> 43:38.960
Since I found the Dragon Temple

43:39.599 --> 43:41.039
We'll be jealous of him there

43:41.039 --> 43:42.079
What about Dragon King Temple?

43:46.039 --> 43:47.760
He's just a thief

43:48.039 --> 43:51.480
Thieves don't stay together
with the goods stolen from them

43:51.719 --> 43:52.480
I know that

43:52.760 --> 43:54.599
They do this to avoid getting caught

43:54.920 --> 43:56.440
With wine

43:56.800 --> 43:57.280
Yes

43:57.960 --> 43:59.320
Some thieves

43:59.599 --> 44:02.559
Such as hiding stolen goods
in water

44:02.760 --> 44:05.960
So we call these places
where stolen goods are hidden

44:06.559 --> 44:07.320
Dragon King Temple

44:08.280 --> 44:10.239
People saw the monkey stealing the moon

44:10.480 --> 44:11.880
He was after the stolen goods already

44:14.920 --> 44:17.440
He found an isolated place
along the river

44:17.599 --> 44:20.079
Find a tree and tie a rope to it

44:20.480 --> 44:22.880
The other end of
the rope was tied to a basket

44:23.960 --> 44:26.000
Load stolen goods
in an oil trailer

44:26.000 --> 44:26.880
Put it in the basket

44:27.000 --> 44:29.480
He put something heavy on it
and immersed it in water

44:30.599 --> 44:31.639
And in this case

44:32.840 --> 44:36.079
She intends to set up an ambush
at the Dragon King Temple to arrest him

44:37.000 --> 44:37.599
exactly

44:43.920 --> 44:44.519
Sangang

44:45.079 --> 44:46.079
Why are you here again?

44:48.920 --> 44:50.880
I've already changed my medication

44:52.840 --> 44:54.440
I'm here to tell you one thing

44:55.079 --> 44:56.280
as I expected

44:58.320 --> 45:01.599
We're about to catch the monkey demons

45:03.239 --> 45:04.079
you guys

45:04.480 --> 45:05.320
In reality

45:06.079 --> 45:07.559
I was a thief

45:07.920 --> 45:09.000
I know a thing or two

45:09.239 --> 45:10.719
About the thief

45:10.920 --> 45:12.000
There are basic rules

45:12.480 --> 45:13.840
Belly thieves

45:14.079 --> 45:17.039
high

45:17.239 --> 45:19.719
Never stop moving

45:19.920 --> 45:21.760
Be flexible

45:22.400 --> 45:25.199
No intention to kill

45:26.280 --> 45:27.079
What does it mean?

45:29.360 --> 45:30.599
Firstly

45:31.039 --> 45:33.840
Why would a thief climb walls?

45:33.840 --> 45:35.599
Because ordinary people
cannot reach that level

45:35.679 --> 45:36.679
The view is better from the top

45:36.679 --> 45:37.679
This facilitates escape

45:37.800 --> 45:40.079
So high climbing

45:40.719 --> 45:42.400
secondly

45:42.559 --> 45:44.440
Is the thief
looking for an escape route ?

45:44.440 --> 45:45.599
Or fight with someone

45:46.760 --> 45:48.400
He can't

45:48.599 --> 45:50.880
Stop moving

45:52.280 --> 45:54.199
Third

45:56.599 --> 46:00.000
A thief knows how to distract
and deceive people

46:00.000 --> 46:02.760
Be flexible

46:03.000 --> 46:05.719
Finally, there is no intent to kill

46:05.719 --> 46:07.239
Even if it is necessary to hurt someone

46:07.239 --> 46:08.760
Just to find a way to survive

46:10.360 --> 46:12.280
Without intent to kill or harm lives

46:17.199 --> 46:20.719
Most thieves act
according to these four points

46:21.079 --> 46:22.280
When we try to catch the thief

46:22.760 --> 46:24.840
We should start with these four points

46:25.559 --> 46:26.280
So

46:27.519 --> 46:29.079
We need to practice well

46:29.440 --> 46:30.360
for practice?

46:31.400 --> 46:32.000
Yes

46:32.079 --> 46:33.440
We divided into groups

46:33.440 --> 46:34.440
Each has its own mission

46:35.960 --> 46:37.440
When are you going
to catch the monkey demons?

46:37.719 --> 46:38.639
after three days

46:41.079 --> 46:41.840
you guys

46:42.320 --> 46:43.960
The monkey demon will walk
on rooftops

46:43.960 --> 46:45.199
Although it is not easy to catch

46:45.320 --> 46:46.320
He has shortcomings

46:46.320 --> 46:47.559
We must be fast

46:47.880 --> 46:48.880
No matter what

46:48.880 --> 46:50.719
He cannot run as fast as required
on flat ground

46:51.320 --> 46:52.239
As long as you know

46:52.239 --> 46:53.800
Which direction does it go?

46:53.880 --> 46:55.000
You will not be left behind

46:55.079 --> 46:56.239
When you follow it to the ground

46:56.519 --> 46:57.639
How should we know?

46:58.000 --> 46:59.360
Which direction is it going?

46:59.360 --> 47:00.239
at that time

47:02.320 --> 47:04.079
Just follow me

47:05.480 --> 47:08.559
I will go

47:08.880 --> 47:11.719
Fast like a fox

47:27.679 --> 47:28.239
Here he comes

47:37.360 --> 47:38.960
Don't think you can catch it with
just a net

47:39.159 --> 47:40.159
We can use it to stop it

47:40.800 --> 47:41.920
In the middle of the night, it's hard

47:42.360 --> 47:43.599
You have to run as soon as the water enters

48:06.559 --> 48:07.039
Chase

48:07.199 --> 48:07.639
Go

48:07.639 --> 48:08.320
faster

48:16.960 --> 48:19.480
The oil must be blown up immediately

48:19.960 --> 48:21.480
Because we don't know
when it will arrive

48:22.079 --> 48:23.480
If we divide it too early, it will dry out

48:28.880 --> 48:29.800
Forest fires?

48:36.800 --> 48:37.639
Fire is not exciting

48:38.519 --> 48:39.119
Chase

48:39.719 --> 48:40.119
Go

48:47.760 --> 48:48.639
there

49:11.639 --> 49:13.000
To the east, raise the lantern

49:18.559 --> 49:19.599
He went east, fast

49:21.760 --> 49:24.440
Setting boundaries
as we just learned

49:24.920 --> 49:25.760
To the east

49:26.119 --> 49:27.159
We will light one lantern

49:28.840 --> 49:30.679
To the west, we'll light two

49:31.360 --> 49:32.760
To the south, three lanterns

49:33.360 --> 49:34.719
To the north, four lanterns

49:48.679 --> 49:49.400
to forbid

51:13.079 --> 51:13.920
It's close to the north

51:14.320 --> 51:15.480
Four white lanterns

51:17.440 --> 51:18.360
He's coming to us

51:18.360 --> 51:19.159
Hurry, get ready

51:26.400 --> 51:26.880
Pull

51:36.880 --> 51:37.800
It's strong

51:38.159 --> 51:39.000
It is enough

51:39.519 --> 51:40.800
But it must be random

51:41.239 --> 51:42.280
With ink

51:42.760 --> 51:43.840
