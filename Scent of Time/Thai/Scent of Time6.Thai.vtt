<i>Episode 5</i>

02:03.960 --> 02:05.520
You need not be nervous.

02:05.600 --> 02:06.800
I wasn't going to rebuke you.

02:06.880 --> 02:08.160
I was just asking.

02:08.600 --> 02:11.000
After all, Hua Shen didn't take much money.

02:15.160 --> 02:17.840
Lord, Her Highness sent a message

02:17.920 --> 02:19.160
saying that Master Zhong is here

02:19.240 --> 02:20.600
and is looking for Mistress.

02:23.320 --> 02:24.360
All right.

02:24.680 --> 02:26.560
Let's go to my mother's residence.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Mother.

02:35.120 --> 02:36.120
It's been a long time.

02:40.760 --> 02:42.000
Thank you for the lychee, Mother.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.160
Do they taste good?

02:44.600 --> 02:45.600
What's wrong?

02:50.720 --> 02:53.200
Master and Mistress really love each other.

02:53.280 --> 02:54.920
We do envy that.

03:00.520 --> 03:02.840
Senior, I haven't seen you for a long time

03:02.920 --> 03:04.520
and was wondering what you've been up to.

03:04.920 --> 03:06.240
Work has been busy

03:06.840 --> 03:08.160
so I took a break today.

03:30.840 --> 03:32.920
Did someone give you a hard time earlier?

03:36.080 --> 03:37.160
Qian

03:37.680 --> 03:40.000
why do you keep everything to yourself now?

03:40.320 --> 03:42.440
You used to consult everything with me.

03:47.040 --> 03:48.360
I managed to resolve

03:48.440 --> 03:50.960
Mu Yao's hatred for me

03:51.040 --> 03:53.200
and she doesn't want to kill me anymore.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.000
However, Lord Zhong who had nothing to do

03:55.080 --> 03:56.080
with my family before

03:56.160 --> 03:58.760
is beginning to turn against us.

03:58.840 --> 04:02.080
Can the original ending not be altered?

04:02.160 --> 04:04.720
Where did I go wrong this time?

04:08.920 --> 04:10.000
Qian.

04:12.240 --> 04:13.240
Qian.

04:14.240 --> 04:15.240
Qian!

04:16.960 --> 04:19.360
You went into a daze again. Did you hear me?

04:20.960 --> 04:22.040
Sorry.

04:22.640 --> 04:24.640
The fragrance in here makes me a little dizzy

04:24.720 --> 04:25.920
so I didn't hear you just now.

04:28.240 --> 04:29.960
There's no fragrance in the carriage.

04:32.320 --> 04:33.800
But I smell it.

04:33.880 --> 04:34.920
Qian

04:36.080 --> 04:37.280
you seem to have got a lot on your mind

04:37.360 --> 04:38.560
after we got married.

04:39.160 --> 04:40.320
You don't have to tell me

04:40.400 --> 04:41.440
what's on your mind.

04:42.160 --> 04:45.120
Just remember that as long as I'm here

04:45.200 --> 04:46.320
I'll protect you.

04:47.680 --> 04:48.680
You don't have to go to Mistress

04:48.760 --> 04:49.840
even if you're angry

04:50.200 --> 04:52.000
and don't want to spend time with me.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.640
I won't go to you...

04:58.120 --> 04:59.760
if you don't want me to do that.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.400
<i>Am I really the one...</i>

05:09.960 --> 05:11.520
<i>you want to protect?</i>

05:21.400 --> 05:22.440
Miss.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.480
It's late. You'd better go to bed.

05:28.760 --> 05:32.120
Miss, your father asked me

05:32.200 --> 05:34.120
about your situation here a few days ago.

05:37.640 --> 05:39.160
Are you my maid

05:39.640 --> 05:41.080
or my father's maid?

05:41.440 --> 05:43.760
I'm your maid, Miss.

05:44.160 --> 05:45.240
Really?

05:45.520 --> 05:47.160
It doesn't seem like that way.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.680
Your father does care about you.

05:50.680 --> 05:54.520
After all, you've been here for many years

05:55.120 --> 05:57.440
and are about to reach the age of marriage.

05:58.240 --> 06:00.760
But you're not close to Her Highness.

06:01.680 --> 06:03.160
I'm afraid

06:03.240 --> 06:06.200
he'll be unhappy about it.

06:06.560 --> 06:08.880
I've lived in Zhong's Garden as he wanted.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.320
Why is he still dissatisfied?

06:11.800 --> 06:15.080
I only know a maid's life

06:15.640 --> 06:17.760
is in the hands of her master.

06:18.520 --> 06:20.440
If they aren't happy

06:20.880 --> 06:22.280
they can beat us

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
or sell us at will.

06:27.840 --> 06:30.400
I get it. You can go now.

06:32.200 --> 06:33.200
I'm going to bed.

06:34.520 --> 06:35.520
All right.

08:17.160 --> 08:18.320
Mistress.

08:18.600 --> 08:19.600
Mistress.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.560
Don't wake me up.

08:21.640 --> 08:22.800
Let me sleep a bit more.

08:22.880 --> 08:24.600
I'm not going to Zhong's Garden today.

08:31.440 --> 08:33.400
What's the matter with you today, Mistress?

08:33.760 --> 08:35.040
Qian Zhi has tried to wake you thrice

08:35.120 --> 08:36.840
and it'll be noon soon.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.760
You should get up.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.200
Oh, no.

08:47.720 --> 08:48.800
You're burning up.

08:48.880 --> 08:50.360
Qianzhi, get a physician.

08:50.440 --> 08:51.440
All right.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.120
Physician Xia, how's she doing?

09:11.200 --> 09:15.000
Mistress probably caught a cold last night.

09:15.600 --> 09:16.840
I'll prescribe some medicine

09:16.920 --> 09:18.800
and aromatherapy.

09:18.880 --> 09:20.480
It's my fault. I slept like a log

09:20.560 --> 09:22.120
and didn't hear the wind.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.200
I saw the window

09:23.280 --> 09:25.360
in Mistress's room open this morning.

09:25.760 --> 09:27.280
How could you be so careless?

09:27.640 --> 09:28.840
She's fine.

09:28.920 --> 09:30.840
She only needs to take the medicine.

09:30.920 --> 09:31.920
All right.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.840
Be careful not to let her get cold.

09:34.120 --> 09:35.720
This way, please.

09:35.800 --> 09:36.840
Thank you.

09:40.600 --> 09:44.480
I was going to make up some excuse

09:44.560 --> 09:45.600
but now I have a valid reason

09:46.200 --> 09:48.400
not to go to Zhong's Garden.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.360
If you don't want to go

09:52.440 --> 09:54.040
just don't go, Mistress.

09:54.120 --> 09:55.240
You don't understand.

09:55.360 --> 09:57.040
I go there so often.

09:57.320 --> 09:59.520
If I don't go after what happened yesterday

09:59.600 --> 10:00.920
it'd look very fishy.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.080
What happened yesterday?

10:09.960 --> 10:10.960
<i>Shende Hall</i>

10:11.040 --> 10:12.040
Master.

10:12.480 --> 10:14.760
Mistress just has a cold and she'll be fine.

10:15.080 --> 10:17.280
I've prescribed some medicine

10:17.360 --> 10:19.760
and she only needs to keep warm.

10:19.840 --> 10:21.240
I see. You may go now.

10:21.680 --> 10:22.680
I'll take my leave.

10:32.360 --> 10:33.360
Master.

10:34.080 --> 10:36.680
Are you going to see Mistress, Master?

10:38.360 --> 10:40.960
I'd better not bother her now.

10:42.560 --> 10:44.080
Send a message to Hua Residence.

10:44.760 --> 10:45.920
She must want to see her family very much

10:46.000 --> 10:48.080
when she's sick.

10:48.720 --> 10:49.720
All right.

11:12.320 --> 11:14.720
Mistress, take this before you go to sleep.

11:22.320 --> 11:23.560
Is it too bitter?

11:23.640 --> 11:24.640
I've prepared preserved fruits for you

11:24.720 --> 11:25.760
Mistress.

11:29.960 --> 11:32.200
No need. This is nothing.

11:38.920 --> 11:40.680
Mistress, Butler Ji is here.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.280
Greetings, Mistress.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.640
What's the matter?

11:48.720 --> 11:49.880
Mistress.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.720
We were short of manpower

11:51.800 --> 11:53.040
and new guards have just been recruited.

11:53.360 --> 11:54.600
Here's the roster.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.360
For your inspection, Mistress.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.640
No need. You're experienced.

11:58.720 --> 12:00.680
Just do it your way.

12:01.360 --> 12:02.760
I'll take my leave then.

12:20.680 --> 12:21.800
Your Highness.

12:21.880 --> 12:23.720
It's already noon.

12:24.480 --> 12:27.040
Why hasn't she come here today?

12:28.440 --> 12:31.520
I sent someone to inquire earlier.

12:32.200 --> 12:34.800
Mistress caught a cold.

12:35.440 --> 12:36.560
A cold?

12:37.760 --> 12:40.120
She must be very sick

12:40.400 --> 12:43.760
because Master had sent for a doctor.

12:44.760 --> 12:46.360
Bring me

12:46.440 --> 12:48.760
the incense beads she sent a few days ago.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.680
It shouldn't be put away all the time.

12:52.680 --> 12:53.920
By the way

12:54.000 --> 12:57.200
pick some nourishing medicinal herbs

12:57.280 --> 12:58.680
from the storage for her.

12:59.360 --> 13:01.680
She's so thin.

13:01.760 --> 13:03.360
No wonder she has poor health

13:03.440 --> 13:05.080
and is prone to illness.

13:06.520 --> 13:08.320
Yes, Your Highness.

13:21.440 --> 13:22.880
???Greetings, Lord.             ???You may rise.

13:22.960 --> 13:23.960
Sit.

13:25.160 --> 13:26.720
I heard that you sent for a doctor earlier.

13:26.800 --> 13:27.800
What's the matter with you?

13:27.880 --> 13:28.920
Are you not feeling well?

13:29.240 --> 13:30.520
Nothing.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.400
I just didn't sleep well last night

13:32.480 --> 13:34.120
and had a headache when I woke up

13:34.640 --> 13:36.040
so I asked to see a doctor.

13:36.640 --> 13:37.800
What did he say?

13:37.880 --> 13:39.640
He said it wasn't serious

13:40.040 --> 13:41.960
and prescribed some calming medicine.

13:42.840 --> 13:43.960
You're assisting my mother

13:44.040 --> 13:45.640
to take care of household affairs

13:45.720 --> 13:46.720
and it's hard work.

13:47.640 --> 13:49.200
I'm glad to be able

13:49.280 --> 13:50.680
to share your worries, Lord.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.040
You've lost weight recently.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.000
There's too much work to do here.

13:55.080 --> 13:56.560
If you feel upset

13:56.840 --> 13:58.440
just invite your family over.

13:59.160 --> 14:00.560
Aren't your mother and sister

14:00.640 --> 14:01.880
still in the city?

14:03.440 --> 14:04.440
My sister's birthday

14:04.520 --> 14:06.120
is coming in four or five days.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.680
She's young and spoilt

14:09.080 --> 14:10.680
and insisted on seeing my father.

14:11.320 --> 14:13.600
My mother had no choice

14:13.880 --> 14:15.240
but to take her out of the city yesterday.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.400
They set off to see our father in the south

14:17.800 --> 14:20.520
and will stay there for a while.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.920
Butler Meng has lived there for many years

14:23.440 --> 14:25.080
and seldom comes back.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.960
It's normal for a child to miss her father.

14:28.520 --> 14:30.920
We're very grateful

14:31.000 --> 14:33.160
for your trust in our family, Lord.

14:36.360 --> 14:39.960
By the way, I heard Her Highness

14:40.040 --> 14:42.360
asked for a physician this morning as well.

14:43.760 --> 14:45.080
What's wrong with my mother?

14:45.160 --> 14:46.960
Her Highness is fine.

14:47.280 --> 14:48.600
She just ordered the physician

14:48.680 --> 14:50.480
to prepare some nourishing herbs

14:51.200 --> 14:53.760
and sent them to Mistress

14:54.040 --> 14:55.880
who seems to have a cold.

15:05.680 --> 15:06.880
A cold...

15:07.840 --> 15:09.920
Mistress has changed a lot

15:10.000 --> 15:11.320
and is more likeable

15:11.800 --> 15:13.600
after she got married.

15:13.920 --> 15:16.560
No wonder Her Highness treats her nicer now.

15:17.400 --> 15:19.000
My mother chats well with her

15:19.080 --> 15:20.760
so she naturally cares about her.

15:21.480 --> 15:22.600
That's true.

15:29.840 --> 15:31.000
Be careful, Mother.

15:31.600 --> 15:32.760
Go.

15:33.840 --> 15:35.000
These medicinal herbs are precious.

15:35.080 --> 15:36.400
I'll watch them move it.

15:37.280 --> 15:38.680
You do that.

15:38.760 --> 15:39.760
I'll go to see my sister now.

15:39.840 --> 15:40.920
Stop.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.360
Don't run around.

15:44.760 --> 15:47.160
This is Zhong Residence, not our house.

15:47.240 --> 15:48.320
Did you hear me?

15:48.400 --> 15:50.360
???Got it...                 ???Behave yourself.

15:50.440 --> 15:51.440
Let's go...

15:53.200 --> 15:54.240
Go.

16:17.160 --> 16:18.320
Miss.

16:20.560 --> 16:21.600
Do you know

16:21.680 --> 16:23.720
where your mistress's residence is?

16:28.520 --> 16:29.840
We haven't been here before

16:29.920 --> 16:31.000
and don't know the way.

16:31.400 --> 16:32.400
I wonder if it's convenient

16:32.480 --> 16:34.720
for you to take me there.

16:39.480 --> 16:40.520
Can you?

16:43.280 --> 16:45.160
Sir, I came here before

16:45.240 --> 16:46.240
and I still remember the way.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.480
You're the eldest son of the Hua family?

16:51.040 --> 16:52.200
Do you know me?

16:54.680 --> 16:55.800
Where are you going?

16:58.160 --> 16:59.240
Sir

16:59.560 --> 17:00.560
weren't you going to see your sister?

17:02.680 --> 17:03.720
What's this place?

17:04.360 --> 17:05.840
<i>Shende Hall</i>

17:06.480 --> 17:08.080
It must be Master Zhong's study.

17:09.520 --> 17:12.120
Have you noticed that the maid

17:12.640 --> 17:14.120
looks a little different?

17:15.760 --> 17:18.200
Sir, isn't every one of your concubines

17:18.280 --> 17:19.520
different, too?

17:23.680 --> 17:24.840
Stop.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.120
Tell me what you mean.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.280
How dare you talk to me that way?

17:30.280 --> 17:32.520
Qian. Mother.

17:33.200 --> 17:34.520
Didn't you leave before me?

17:34.600 --> 17:36.280
Why are you so late?

17:38.280 --> 17:39.440
Huang took me in the wrong direction

17:39.880 --> 17:41.440
so we ended up taking the longer route.

17:52.240 --> 17:55.240
Qian, I heard you got sick.

17:55.320 --> 17:57.400
You seem to have lost a lot of weight.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.920
Mother, you feel that way

18:00.000 --> 18:01.400
probably because we haven't met in a while.

18:02.880 --> 18:05.880
Your father and I stayed at the clan house

18:05.960 --> 18:07.280
for over a month

18:07.360 --> 18:09.720
because of what happened to your cousin

18:09.800 --> 18:11.280
in Zhong's Garden.

18:11.600 --> 18:12.840
We just came back

18:12.920 --> 18:14.800
and heard he got you in trouble again.

18:15.640 --> 18:17.080
Yes, he did.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.920
Very big trouble.

18:30.600 --> 18:31.600
Qian.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.760
You've never bought jewellery

18:33.840 --> 18:35.680
since you got married

18:35.760 --> 18:37.720
so I specially bought some for you

18:38.080 --> 18:39.320
in the past few days.

18:39.400 --> 18:40.480
I've got plenty of this.

18:43.280 --> 18:44.760
How can you say that?

18:44.840 --> 18:46.720
Your brother really cares about you

18:46.800 --> 18:48.240
and bought all the good ones

18:48.320 --> 18:50.840
in the jewellery store for you.

18:50.920 --> 18:52.760
He didn't even get any for me.

18:58.480 --> 19:00.400
I know you wouldn't be angry with me.

19:00.480 --> 19:01.520
Foolish child.

19:01.920 --> 19:03.440
You're of the same blood.

19:03.520 --> 19:05.120
Of course, she'll forgive you.

19:05.720 --> 19:08.520
You're right, Mother. Qian is blessed.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.800
This house is really magnificent

19:11.160 --> 19:12.760
and much better than our house.

19:13.600 --> 19:15.360
Not just that. Even the servants here

19:15.440 --> 19:16.480
look different from others.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.320
When I came over

19:18.400 --> 19:19.520
I saw a maid

19:19.600 --> 19:21.120
coming out of my brother-in-law's study.

19:21.200 --> 19:23.040
She looks pretty

19:24.200 --> 19:26.120
but I don't think I've ever seen her

19:26.200 --> 19:27.360
around you before.

19:28.040 --> 19:29.200
Who is she?

19:30.560 --> 19:31.720
Master's study?

19:33.800 --> 19:36.000
There are enough maids in my residence.

19:36.440 --> 19:38.920
Last time I went to your study

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
I found that it was poorly staffed.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.720
I'll let Mu Yao go there to serve you.

19:46.080 --> 19:48.560
<i>In my previous life, both of us were friends</i>

19:48.640 --> 19:50.840
<i>but she and Hua Shen never knew each other</i>

19:51.360 --> 19:52.920
<i>so it's no wonder he didn't recognise her.</i>

19:57.560 --> 19:59.320
Why are you asking about his maid?

20:00.560 --> 20:02.040
I'm just asking.

20:02.120 --> 20:03.160
Hua Shen!

20:03.720 --> 20:05.440
Get your head screwed on straight!

20:05.520 --> 20:06.760
You know Zhong Yelan is...

20:08.200 --> 20:09.200
His staff

20:09.280 --> 20:10.840
aren't people you can have designs on.

20:11.120 --> 20:13.720
???I...        ???You've always been a womaniser

20:13.800 --> 20:15.480
but don't get us in trouble!

20:15.560 --> 20:19.280
Qian, simmer down. I was just asking.

20:19.360 --> 20:21.000
I dare not get involved with the staff here.

20:21.080 --> 20:22.680
Let me shut up now.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.920
Don't talk like that.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.440
You know how your brother is like.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.560
He just speaks whatever comes to mind.

20:32.320 --> 20:33.840
By the way

20:34.120 --> 20:36.840
Master now has a maid by his side?

20:37.240 --> 20:39.520
Doesn't he dislike being served by maids?

20:40.040 --> 20:41.200
What do you know about that maid?

20:41.280 --> 20:43.640
Mother, what you should do now

20:43.720 --> 20:45.560
is keep an eye on your son

20:45.640 --> 20:47.160
not meddle in the Zhong family's affairs.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.080
I'm just looking out for your best interests.

20:51.800 --> 20:53.840
Why are you angry?

21:03.960 --> 21:05.200
After all

21:06.000 --> 21:08.360
you just have one sibling in him

21:08.440 --> 21:11.200
and he'll be your only family in the future.

21:11.480 --> 21:13.800
Even if he's a little dull

21:14.240 --> 21:16.800
he still treats you sincerely.

21:16.880 --> 21:19.480
Mother, you've always been partial to him.

21:19.560 --> 21:20.760
Look at what he has done.

21:20.840 --> 21:22.840
Calling him dull is a compliment to him.

21:23.800 --> 21:24.840
Listen.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.760
When I was pregnant with you

21:26.840 --> 21:28.280
he was only five.

21:28.360 --> 21:29.840
He came to me every day

21:30.560 --> 21:32.160
asking when you'd be born.

21:32.240 --> 21:33.840
He said that he'd protect you

21:34.120 --> 21:35.680
and love you.

21:35.760 --> 21:36.800
Mother, please pass my father a message

21:36.880 --> 21:38.280
after you go back.

21:39.120 --> 21:40.160
What is it?

21:40.600 --> 21:43.160
"A small leak will sink a great ship".

21:43.880 --> 21:45.080
What does it mean?

21:45.160 --> 21:48.200
Father knows what my brother did

21:48.280 --> 21:49.680
to the shops in his charge.

21:49.760 --> 21:51.680
I don't think I need to say more.

21:52.680 --> 21:55.040
Tell him what my brother did today

21:55.720 --> 21:57.520
and he'll understand what I said.

21:58.120 --> 21:59.520
The shops belong to the Zhong family.

21:59.920 --> 22:01.720
My brother needs to be disciplined.

22:03.800 --> 22:04.800
<i>Hua Residence</i>

22:04.880 --> 22:06.120
How's Qian?

22:08.040 --> 22:10.520
She looks weak

22:10.800 --> 22:12.560
but sounds still energetic

22:12.920 --> 22:14.640
so I don't think she's seriously ill.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.200
Great.

22:19.280 --> 22:20.760
???You may go now.                ???Yes, Madam.

22:21.640 --> 22:22.640
Where's Shen?

22:24.840 --> 22:25.960
He said

22:26.440 --> 22:28.680
he had not finished his homework

22:28.760 --> 22:30.200
so he went back to his room.

22:33.200 --> 22:35.760
He went back to study?

22:35.840 --> 22:37.840
Did the sun rise from the west today?

22:38.400 --> 22:39.480
He must have sneaked out again

22:39.560 --> 22:41.720
to play with his cronies.

22:41.800 --> 22:43.320
How can that be?

22:43.400 --> 22:45.040
Qian's still sick.

22:45.120 --> 22:46.880
He's worried about her.

22:46.960 --> 22:48.320
So he wouldn't go out to have fun

22:48.400 --> 22:49.880
at a time like this.

22:51.040 --> 22:52.840
You know what?

22:52.920 --> 22:55.320
I don't worry about Qian's marriage now.

22:55.960 --> 22:57.400
But I do worry about Shen's marriage.

22:57.920 --> 22:59.720
He's not young

23:00.080 --> 23:02.760
but hasn't settled down yet.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.000
There's no hurry.

23:04.080 --> 23:06.600
Qian's the wife of Master Zhong now.

23:06.680 --> 23:07.880
Many merchants in this town

23:07.960 --> 23:10.680
want to become our relatives by marriage.

23:10.760 --> 23:12.160
He doesn't need to marry down.

23:13.120 --> 23:15.600
But our son has neither literacy talent

23:15.680 --> 23:16.880
nor excellent martial arts.

23:17.240 --> 23:18.520
In my opinion

23:18.600 --> 23:21.040
it doesn't matter

23:21.120 --> 23:22.360
even if the girl is from an ordinary family.

23:22.440 --> 23:23.440
He can handle her easily

23:23.520 --> 23:24.840
and won't be bullied.

23:25.480 --> 23:27.120
Even if he isn't exceptional

23:27.200 --> 23:29.440
he's still our only son.

23:29.920 --> 23:31.200
Daughters from ordinary families

23:31.280 --> 23:33.240
cannot marry into our family.

23:33.320 --> 23:35.080
I know what you're saying.

23:36.160 --> 23:37.320
But think about this.

23:37.840 --> 23:40.560
Shen has a lot of concubines.

23:41.440 --> 23:42.920
If an aristocrat's daughter marries him

23:43.000 --> 23:44.520
and got to know that

23:45.480 --> 23:46.960
she'll be furious.

23:51.000 --> 23:55.400
You must discipline him.

23:55.480 --> 23:57.760
I've never stopped him

23:57.840 --> 23:59.320
from taking concubines

23:59.400 --> 24:02.120
but he still goes out and fools around.

24:02.480 --> 24:05.440
A man should have ambition

24:05.720 --> 24:07.040
but he fools around

24:07.120 --> 24:09.840
with his concubines all day.

24:10.720 --> 24:12.240
When I go there

24:12.320 --> 24:13.960
there's not even enough room for me.

24:14.960 --> 24:16.120
All right...

24:16.360 --> 24:18.040
Don't be angry.

24:18.120 --> 24:19.600
You're right. I should discipline him

24:20.320 --> 24:23.160
and curb his frivolous ways.

24:23.840 --> 24:24.920
Wait.

24:26.320 --> 24:27.400
This is strange.

24:27.480 --> 24:30.080
???What?      ???Don't you always side with him?

24:30.760 --> 24:32.040
What happened today?

24:32.120 --> 24:34.000
Why the sudden change?

24:34.840 --> 24:36.760
Did he cause trouble at Zhong Residence?

24:36.840 --> 24:39.120
No...

24:39.560 --> 24:40.920
I...

24:41.560 --> 24:43.000
I just noticed that

24:43.080 --> 24:44.720
Qian had become mature

24:44.800 --> 24:46.160
after getting married

24:48.320 --> 24:52.640
and that Shen can't live up to her.

24:52.720 --> 24:54.200
<i>Store ledger</i>

24:54.280 --> 24:55.920
She has indeed changed a lot

24:56.000 --> 24:57.240
after getting married.

24:57.840 --> 25:00.960
What did she say to you today?

25:01.840 --> 25:05.960
Nothing, just something trivial.

25:06.400 --> 25:07.880
I'll remove these.

25:10.240 --> 25:12.080
My dear...

25:12.960 --> 25:15.840
My dear, don't worry about Shen's marriage.

25:19.200 --> 25:21.600
???He looks so handsome.               ???Right?

25:21.680 --> 25:24.040
He has fair skin and long eyelashes.

25:24.120 --> 25:25.200
Right?

25:25.280 --> 25:26.560
You're infatuated with him.

25:26.640 --> 25:27.880
What's with the racket?

25:27.960 --> 25:30.560
Mistress is sick. Be quiet.

25:30.640 --> 25:32.720
Qianzhi, I've told you many times

25:32.800 --> 25:34.000
to be gentle.

25:34.080 --> 25:35.600
Don't always behave like this.

25:36.080 --> 25:38.680
I think you're the loudest here.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.280
What happened?

25:42.360 --> 25:43.360
Why are you so happy?

25:43.920 --> 25:45.240
Haven't you heard, Mistress?

25:45.320 --> 25:46.880
Some new guards were recruited.

25:48.520 --> 25:50.400
Butler Ji did mention it to me.

25:50.480 --> 25:51.480
What's the matter?

25:51.560 --> 25:54.120
One of them is so good-looking

25:54.200 --> 25:56.400
that the maids have gone to check him out.

25:57.680 --> 25:58.680
Really?

25:59.600 --> 26:00.960
But I don't have any impression

26:01.040 --> 26:02.960
of this good-looking guard.

26:03.760 --> 26:06.680
Mistress, you fell ill the day he joined us

26:06.760 --> 26:08.320
so you haven't seen him.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.800
Mistress, you'll be surprised

26:09.880 --> 26:11.280
when you finally see him.

26:11.360 --> 26:15.040
I've never seen such a good-looking man.

26:15.680 --> 26:17.240
Both of you are so ignorant.

26:17.320 --> 26:18.320
He's just a guard.

26:18.400 --> 26:19.400
What use can be made out of his beauty?

26:20.000 --> 26:21.800
If you've seen him

26:21.880 --> 26:23.440
you wouldn't say such words.

26:23.880 --> 26:25.840
I'm not as ignorant as you are.

26:27.560 --> 26:28.760
After hearing what you said

26:28.840 --> 26:30.200
I'm curious to see him.

26:32.880 --> 26:35.400
Mistress, you're still in recovery.

26:35.480 --> 26:37.720
By the way, he's just a servant.

26:37.800 --> 26:38.800
No one in the world

26:38.880 --> 26:40.600
can compare to Master Zhong.

26:43.720 --> 26:45.320
It was just a passing remark.

26:46.120 --> 26:48.480
Master's birthday is in half a month.

26:48.560 --> 26:50.720
What's your plan, Mistress?

26:51.040 --> 26:52.040
Birthday?

26:52.400 --> 26:53.600
Master's birthday!

26:53.680 --> 26:55.160
Have you forgotten it, Mistress?

26:57.840 --> 26:59.320
<i>Zhong Yelan's birthday?</i>

27:00.280 --> 27:01.560
<i>I forgot about it.</i>

27:02.040 --> 27:03.040
<i>Wait.</i>

27:03.280 --> 27:05.200
<i>Isn't that what started the relationship</i>

27:05.280 --> 27:06.680
<i>between him and Mu Yao?</i>

27:13.440 --> 27:15.320
Master, it's getting late

27:15.400 --> 27:16.600
and it's time to go back now.

27:16.880 --> 27:18.560
It's your birthday today.

27:19.640 --> 27:21.720
I want to be with my mother a little longer.

27:31.480 --> 27:33.240
Why are you kneeling here?

27:33.320 --> 27:35.480
Did your parents punish you, too?

27:36.880 --> 27:38.400
No one punished me.

27:38.920 --> 27:40.800
I do it of my own will.

27:40.880 --> 27:42.440
What's wrong with you?

27:42.520 --> 27:45.520
Why do you want to kneel here?

27:46.760 --> 27:48.960
My mother's tablet is here.

27:50.200 --> 27:51.720
My father often says

27:51.800 --> 27:54.880
parents like to see their children

27:54.960 --> 27:58.080
live a happy and carefree life.

27:58.160 --> 27:59.680
Do you think

27:59.760 --> 28:01.960
your mother wants you

28:02.040 --> 28:04.760
to kneel in front of her tablet

28:04.840 --> 28:06.880
with a sad face?

28:07.800 --> 28:09.400
I haven't met her before.

28:10.240 --> 28:11.760
On the day I was born

28:12.240 --> 28:14.400
she...

28:15.600 --> 28:19.240
All mothers love their children.

28:19.320 --> 28:21.920
Probably your kneeling

28:22.000 --> 28:25.560
has already broken her heart.

28:29.160 --> 28:32.080
Do you want to go with me to see the release?

28:41.720 --> 28:43.720
I heard this temple delivers our prayers.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.080
Let's go pray together.

29:23.920 --> 29:26.320
All right. Now that I've brought you here

29:26.400 --> 29:28.440
I'll go to my father.

29:29.680 --> 29:31.160
What's your name?

29:31.240 --> 29:32.240
My father said

29:32.320 --> 29:35.120
I shouldn't tell my name to strangers.

29:35.680 --> 29:38.720
Can I see your face?

29:39.160 --> 29:41.520
No. I have a rash on my face

29:41.600 --> 29:43.040
so I can't remove my veil.

29:47.800 --> 29:49.280
This is for you.

29:49.360 --> 29:51.320
If you want to see me next time

29:51.400 --> 29:52.640
just show it

29:52.720 --> 29:55.560
to the abbot of this temple.

29:56.120 --> 29:58.200
All right... I'll take it.

29:58.280 --> 29:59.840
See you around.

30:10.640 --> 30:14.520
Mother, I'll visit you another day.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.040
<i>Oh, Heavens</i>

30:19.520 --> 30:21.120
<i>if you'd wanted to give me another chance</i>

30:21.400 --> 30:22.600
<i>why didn't you send me back</i>

30:22.680 --> 30:24.520
<i>before I started impersonating her?</i>

30:25.080 --> 30:28.640
<i>It's too hard to turn it around now.</i>

30:39.200 --> 30:40.360
Mistress.

30:40.640 --> 30:41.640
All right.

30:45.200 --> 30:47.640
How will you plan the birthday banquet?

30:49.840 --> 30:50.880
<i>Wait.</i>

30:51.080 --> 30:52.880
<i>I remember that day</i>

30:52.960 --> 30:55.320
<i>Lord would come to the banquet unexpectedly</i>

30:55.400 --> 30:56.960
<i>and fall in love with Mu Yao at first sight.</i>

30:57.520 --> 30:59.560
<i>He treated me like that a few days ago.</i>

30:59.880 --> 31:01.800
<i>This is the perfect time to distract him</i>

31:02.360 --> 31:04.240
<i>so he won't be preoccupied with</i>

31:04.320 --> 31:05.680
<i>harming my family.</i>

31:06.560 --> 31:08.240
Let's keep it low-key.

31:08.320 --> 31:09.800
After all, it's also his mother's...

31:14.360 --> 31:17.480
I don't think he'd appreciate fanfare.

31:21.600 --> 31:23.760
Mistress, how about I go to the storage now

31:23.840 --> 31:25.680
and retrieve the <i>guqin</i> Master gave you?

31:25.760 --> 31:26.760
The exquisite <i>guqin</i>

31:26.840 --> 31:28.040
and your excellent playing skills

31:28.120 --> 31:29.680
will surely astound everyone.

31:29.760 --> 31:30.800
No need.

31:36.360 --> 31:37.560
Yes. Go retrieve it.

31:38.120 --> 31:39.120
Sure.

31:51.480 --> 31:52.480
Master.

31:52.560 --> 31:54.480
Mistress's maid, Qianzhi, wants to see you.

31:58.040 --> 31:59.200
Greetings, Master.

32:00.680 --> 32:02.880
Mistress asked me to send you a message.

32:02.960 --> 32:04.560
She wants you to come back early

32:04.640 --> 32:06.080
after work today.

32:06.160 --> 32:08.720
She has prepared a birthday banquet for you.

32:10.520 --> 32:13.280
No need. I never celebrate my birthday.

32:13.560 --> 32:14.880
But she started preparing for it

32:14.960 --> 32:16.280
half a month ago.

32:25.840 --> 32:26.840
All right.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.920
<i>Shende Hall</i>

32:54.680 --> 32:55.920
The <i>guqin</i> is prepared.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.120
Should I bring it out now?

32:57.640 --> 33:00.320
No need. Follow my lead later.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.400
By the way, put another chair here

33:03.480 --> 33:05.760
for Lord to sit.

33:06.560 --> 33:07.560
Is he coming, too?

33:07.640 --> 33:09.160
Master didn't mention it.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.200
Just trust me.

33:15.520 --> 33:17.640
The quality of this batch of blood amber

33:17.720 --> 33:19.040
isn't as good as the previous batch.

33:19.120 --> 33:20.920
If we use it to make Jiayin Pills

33:21.200 --> 33:22.440
they'll be much less effective

33:23.240 --> 33:25.760
and that'd ruin our reputation.

33:26.760 --> 33:28.480
If the supply is insufficient

33:29.040 --> 33:31.760
I'm afraid we'll have to sell

33:31.840 --> 33:33.080
fewer pills each year.

33:40.320 --> 33:41.400
Senior.

33:44.800 --> 33:45.800
Senior!

33:46.720 --> 33:47.840
What's the matter?

33:48.040 --> 33:50.200
Have you got other things to do?

33:52.680 --> 33:53.720
Lord.

33:54.320 --> 33:55.600
I've got something else to do today.

33:55.680 --> 33:57.760
Let's compound the fragrance another day.

33:59.800 --> 34:01.240
I almost forgot.

34:01.320 --> 34:03.240
Are you going to the temple this year, too?

34:04.400 --> 34:05.440
No, I'm not.

34:05.880 --> 34:07.360
When I went out this morning

34:07.440 --> 34:08.720
Qian sent a message

34:09.520 --> 34:11.440
saying that she had prepared a banquet

34:11.520 --> 34:12.680
and wanted me to go back early today.

34:14.800 --> 34:17.120
I'd like to attend this banquet

34:17.680 --> 34:19.120
since it has piqued your interest.

34:20.360 --> 34:22.240
It's just a family dinner.

34:22.320 --> 34:23.880
I'd be glad

34:23.960 --> 34:25.240
if you come with me, Lord.

34:25.720 --> 34:29.440
Let me change into another outfit.

34:29.920 --> 34:30.920
All right.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.120
Greetings, Lord.

34:36.200 --> 34:37.760
Today is my senior's birthday

34:37.840 --> 34:38.840
and I'm just tagging along.

34:38.920 --> 34:39.920
There's no need for such formalities.

34:51.160 --> 34:52.680
Mistress, you were right.

34:52.760 --> 34:53.760
Lord really came.

34:58.960 --> 35:00.120
Go get ready.

35:11.080 --> 35:12.360
It seems that the cook in your residence

35:12.440 --> 35:14.680
is very good at making spicy meals.

35:16.200 --> 35:17.760
Master loves this taste

35:17.840 --> 35:20.120
so I specially told the cook about it today.

35:24.760 --> 35:27.480
Master's stomach has been upset these days

35:27.840 --> 35:29.760
and the physician told him to avoid spices.

35:36.840 --> 35:40.360
Shall I ask the cook to make other dishes?

35:40.680 --> 35:42.360
It's fine. I'm already much better now.

36:05.280 --> 36:07.280
Mistress, it's ready for you.

36:11.440 --> 36:13.480
It's a bit boring to just eat.

36:14.240 --> 36:17.960
Previously, Master gave me a rare <i>guqin</i>.

36:18.720 --> 36:20.360
Today is your birthday

36:20.440 --> 36:23.280
so I took it out for you today.

36:25.160 --> 36:28.760
I heard Mu Yao plays <i>guqin</i> very well.

36:29.080 --> 36:30.280
I wonder

36:30.760 --> 36:33.880
if you could perform a tune for Master.

36:48.280 --> 36:49.280
Mistress...

36:50.240 --> 36:51.840
Do you need anything else, Mu Yao?

37:41.720 --> 37:44.000
<i>In my previous life, I played a song first</i>

37:44.080 --> 37:46.840
<i>and provoked Mu Yao.</i>

37:47.120 --> 37:48.840
<i>But that caused me a lot of trouble.</i>

37:49.400 --> 37:53.400
<i>This time I'll help her become famous</i>

37:53.480 --> 37:55.880
<i>so she won't need to make use of me.</i>

38:04.320 --> 38:06.200
There are so many talents in your residence.

38:06.280 --> 38:08.480
A mere maid can play such beautiful music.

38:08.560 --> 38:10.160
That's amazing.

38:10.600 --> 38:11.760
You're flattering her.

38:12.120 --> 38:14.040
Her playing is very ordinary.

38:14.120 --> 38:15.440
Not at all.

38:16.400 --> 38:17.840
The music played by this woman

38:17.920 --> 38:19.800
conveys the heroic spirit of soldiers.

38:20.960 --> 38:22.560
Even established musicians

38:22.640 --> 38:23.960
aren't as good as her.

38:25.200 --> 38:26.600
It's just mediocre to me.

38:29.440 --> 38:30.960
Well, then...

38:31.280 --> 38:32.560
Why don't you give her to me?

38:34.000 --> 38:35.120
My mother loves music.

38:35.200 --> 38:36.840
She may relieve her boredom.

38:44.320 --> 38:46.200
<i>Bonus footage</i>

38:53.280 --> 38:54.880
The guard selection has concluded

38:54.960 --> 38:56.840
Butler Ji has picked some agile ones.

38:57.720 --> 38:59.080
Are there talents amongst them?

39:05.200 --> 39:06.680
When I was watching

39:07.000 --> 39:08.760
I noticed an agile man.

39:09.080 --> 39:10.960
He didn't seem to have learnt martial arts

39:11.040 --> 39:13.160
but he could handle the pros very well.

39:13.720 --> 39:16.200
So that makes him a born martial artist?

39:17.800 --> 39:19.880
Rather than that

39:20.080 --> 39:21.960
it was more like he was risking his life.

39:22.440 --> 39:24.200
No matter how powerful his opponents were

39:24.280 --> 39:25.880
they'd inevitably feel a little afraid

39:25.960 --> 39:28.200
when they fought with him.

39:28.280 --> 39:29.760
Someone. Get him down.

39:32.440 --> 39:33.480
All right.

39:33.920 --> 39:35.520
You may go in and register.

39:35.800 --> 39:38.000
From now, you'll live in the guardhouse.

39:39.400 --> 39:40.440
Thank you,  Butler Ji.

39:40.760 --> 39:44.200
Coach him later.

39:45.080 --> 39:46.440
If a person with such a temperament

39:46.520 --> 39:47.840
can really be used by you

39:47.920 --> 39:50.920
he'll never betray you.

39:51.720 --> 39:52.720
Noted.

39:56.560 --> 39:57.600
Wait.

40:01.280 --> 40:02.400
What's your name?

40:04.640 --> 40:05.720
Hua Rongzhou.
