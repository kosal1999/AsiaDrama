<i>Episode 20</i>

01:42.400 --> 01:43.600
Miss, be careful.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.000
Sure enough.

01:46.080 --> 01:50.840
Feelings do fade away over time.

01:51.160 --> 01:52.360
Miss, what are you talking about?

01:54.840 --> 01:55.920
It's nothing.

01:56.040 --> 01:58.280
I feel cold again all of a sudden.

02:00.520 --> 02:01.520
Mistress Hua, are you here

02:01.600 --> 02:02.920
to look for Her Highness again?

02:03.720 --> 02:06.160
Miss Qi, are you here to see Her Highness, too?

02:06.880 --> 02:09.680
No, I came to see you.

02:11.120 --> 02:12.160
Oh, right.

02:12.760 --> 02:15.000
I should call you Miss Hua now.

02:15.320 --> 02:17.360
—You're divorced.                     —Miss!

02:17.440 --> 02:18.880
Miss Qi, please watch what you say!

02:18.960 --> 02:20.000
Miss...

02:24.480 --> 02:26.320
Why are you looking at me like that?

02:26.720 --> 02:28.680
You have been lucky all your life.

02:28.760 --> 02:30.320
Though you're divorced

02:30.400 --> 02:32.240
there's no need to be so sad.

02:32.320 --> 02:33.360
There are many people

02:33.440 --> 02:34.520
who are in worse situations than you.

02:35.720 --> 02:38.400
Qi Ruxin, how have I offended you?

02:38.720 --> 02:40.720
You have had it too easy so far.

02:41.400 --> 02:43.240
That's why I hate you to the core.

02:45.760 --> 02:46.760
By the way

02:47.240 --> 02:49.240
I heard that your brother died.

02:50.160 --> 02:52.560
—Miss!            —Heaven is fair after all.

02:55.880 --> 02:58.720
Say another word about my brother

02:59.080 --> 03:00.480
and I'll make sure you cannot speak

03:00.560 --> 03:01.640
for the rest of your life.

03:01.720 --> 03:05.040
What, do you think you can scare me?

03:05.240 --> 03:06.880
Miss Hua, please forgive my Miss.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.640
The assassins

03:08.720 --> 03:10.160
at the Mid-Autumn Festival banquet

03:10.240 --> 03:11.520
gave her a great fright.

03:11.760 --> 03:13.120
She is still in a state of shock

03:13.200 --> 03:16.360
and hence unable to think straight.

03:16.640 --> 03:17.800
Mistress.

03:20.960 --> 03:23.400
Miss Hua, are you here to see Her Highness?

03:25.360 --> 03:26.480
Miss.

03:30.240 --> 03:31.240
Yes.

03:31.320 --> 03:33.080
I just came out of the study room

03:33.160 --> 03:34.800
and ran into you here.

03:34.880 --> 03:37.440
I guess we do have an affinity.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.160
Come to think of it, you haven't been

03:39.240 --> 03:40.600
to Zhong's Garden for a long while.

03:40.920 --> 03:42.400
That's right.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.680
Miss Hua, if you come to Zhong's Garden again

03:45.760 --> 03:47.560
please come visit me at my compound

03:47.640 --> 03:49.320
so that I have someone to chat with

03:49.560 --> 03:51.080
and not be so lonely

03:51.160 --> 03:52.640
living here at Zhong's Garden.

03:53.760 --> 03:55.200
Aren't you hospitable!

04:01.280 --> 04:02.960
Sister Qi hasn't been herself lately.

04:03.040 --> 04:04.960
She has been saying inappropriate things.

04:05.360 --> 04:07.680
If she has offended you somehow, Miss Hua

04:07.760 --> 04:09.120
I apologise on her behalf.

04:09.320 --> 04:11.600
I hope you won't take it to heart.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.080
I won't.

04:14.960 --> 04:17.080
I tend to speak my mind.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.560
For some reason

04:19.640 --> 04:21.000
I felt like I liked you a lot

04:21.080 --> 04:22.440
the very first time I saw you.

04:23.440 --> 04:25.440
You've returned to the Hua family

04:25.520 --> 04:26.880
and regained freedom.

04:26.960 --> 04:28.440
I'm really happy for you.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.560
Speaking of which, whenever I see you

04:36.640 --> 04:38.480
I do feel a sense of familiarity.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.680
Since you have extended the invitation

04:41.760 --> 04:43.880
may I have the honour

04:43.960 --> 04:45.040
to go to your compound today?

04:45.120 --> 04:46.320
I'm more than happy!

04:50.280 --> 04:52.840
Miss Hua, we haven't seen you around.

04:52.920 --> 04:54.440
What were you busy with?

04:54.520 --> 04:55.960
Nothing much. It's just that I have been

04:56.040 --> 04:57.880
looking for my brother's murderer.

04:58.720 --> 05:01.120
Isn't this what Magistrate Wang should do?

05:01.200 --> 05:03.120
Miss Hua, why are you intervening?

05:04.200 --> 05:05.400
The magistracy investigation

05:05.480 --> 05:06.680
is constrained by red tape.

05:07.240 --> 05:10.080
It's quicker to investigate on my own.

05:10.480 --> 05:13.920
Besides, I'm the assassin's target

05:14.000 --> 05:16.240
so I'm not going to let him off so easily.

05:16.880 --> 05:19.920
Miss Hua, you are so brave and wise.

05:20.520 --> 05:21.880
<i>Why wasn't she surprised</i>

05:21.960 --> 05:24.040
<i>that I was the assassin's target?</i>

05:24.600 --> 05:26.160
<i>Does she know something?</i>

05:27.960 --> 05:30.000
—Miss Meng...     —Why are you two together?

05:33.400 --> 05:34.680
Where are you going?

05:35.920 --> 05:37.040
Lord.

05:37.440 --> 05:39.360
I met Miss Hua by chance just now.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.440
We were having a good time

05:40.520 --> 05:41.520
so I invited her to go to my compound

05:41.600 --> 05:42.600
to carry on.

05:44.200 --> 05:46.480
In that case, please leave.

05:46.560 --> 05:48.840
I need to talk to Hua Qian.

05:49.080 --> 05:50.240
Yes, Lord.

05:58.080 --> 05:59.480
No wonder it's been decided that

05:59.560 --> 06:01.760
Miss Meng would be your wife-to-be.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.120
I see that she's polite

06:04.200 --> 06:05.400
and has a good sense of propriety.

06:05.720 --> 06:07.480
Nothing has been decided.

06:07.560 --> 06:09.560
But why does it sound like...

06:10.240 --> 06:11.560
you're jealous?

06:13.840 --> 06:14.920
I heard that you were here.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
I put down what I was doing

06:16.080 --> 06:17.120
and came to see you.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.600
Why were you leaving as soon as you saw me?

06:21.920 --> 06:23.880
Lord, if you wanted to see me

06:24.080 --> 06:25.440
why didn't I see you

06:25.520 --> 06:28.000
during the two hours I was with Her Highness?

06:28.480 --> 06:30.680
You showed up only after Meng Yifei and I

06:30.760 --> 06:33.680
made plans to spend time together. Why?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.720
What made you angry?

06:42.400 --> 06:43.760
I was rude.

06:43.840 --> 06:45.040
Please forgive me, Lord.

06:45.120 --> 06:46.280
I am leaving.

06:49.560 --> 06:50.600
Qian.

06:53.320 --> 06:55.600
Lately, I have many things to take care of.

06:55.680 --> 06:56.760
I almost couldn't find time

06:56.840 --> 06:58.160
to come and meet you today.

07:00.360 --> 07:03.560
I thought I had made myself clear that day.

07:04.240 --> 07:05.680
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

07:05.760 --> 07:07.600
A little more waiting won't bother me.

07:07.760 --> 07:08.960
After all, you have become

07:09.040 --> 07:10.360
the daughter of the Hua family again.

07:11.840 --> 07:12.960
Lord.

07:13.280 --> 07:15.440
You tend to oversimplify the problem.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.920
Things between you and me

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
are beyond our feelings.

07:19.680 --> 07:22.880
Do you mean Lord of the Zhong family

07:22.960 --> 07:24.360
is simple-minded?

07:26.720 --> 07:28.520
You're also interested in me, aren't you?

07:29.040 --> 07:31.480
I know. You tend to worry a lot.

07:32.840 --> 07:36.840
But I meant what I said to you that day.

07:36.920 --> 07:38.880
You can come to me any time.

07:39.080 --> 07:40.880
As I said, that won't be necessary.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.720
I have given orders at the Star Reaching Tower.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.000
The employees work on fragrance formulas

07:44.080 --> 07:45.160
on the ground floor.

07:45.240 --> 07:47.000
No one is allowed to go to the eleventh floor.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.920
It's exclusive to you.

07:50.320 --> 07:51.520
You can go there

07:51.600 --> 07:52.920
whenever you feel like it.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.920
You can enjoy uninterrupted peace and quiet

07:56.000 --> 07:57.400
when you are there.

08:08.680 --> 08:09.720
No, thanks.

08:10.840 --> 08:12.040
It's on a high floor

08:12.360 --> 08:13.520
and climbing stairs is too tiring.

08:14.560 --> 08:15.800
I don't want to go there again.

08:39.280 --> 08:40.840
Look what the cat's dragged in.

08:40.920 --> 08:42.680
It's rare that you come here, Lord.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.400
Did you have a conflict with Hua...

08:49.920 --> 08:52.000
the daughter of Butler Hua today?

08:52.280 --> 08:54.240
Lord, you came here to ask about this?

08:54.320 --> 08:55.880
The son of the Hua family just passed away

08:55.960 --> 08:56.960
so Hua Qian is now

08:57.040 --> 08:58.920
the only daughter of Butler Hua.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.200
No matter what conflicts you had

09:04.560 --> 09:06.680
I hope you can yield to her.

09:06.760 --> 09:08.520
You want to protect Hua Qian.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.720
Why bother finding an excuse?

09:11.960 --> 09:12.960
What did you say?

09:14.640 --> 09:16.160
Judging by your look

09:16.800 --> 09:18.440
you probably can't get what you want

09:18.520 --> 09:20.120
like me.

09:21.760 --> 09:24.000
Looks like I'm not the only one

09:24.080 --> 09:25.120
feeling miserable.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.400
What do you know?

09:27.880 --> 09:30.880
I know what I should know

09:31.080 --> 09:32.480
and what I shouldn't know.

09:37.240 --> 09:41.080
Why? Are you going to silence me, Lord?

09:41.520 --> 09:42.840
Lord, please forgive her.

09:42.920 --> 09:44.920
Miss was scared out of her wits

09:45.000 --> 09:46.280
at the Mid-Autumn Festival banquet

09:46.440 --> 09:48.200
and hence, she cannot think straight.

09:58.360 --> 10:00.080
Keep an eye on her

10:00.640 --> 10:02.120
and make sure she keeps her mouth shut.

10:03.600 --> 10:04.880
I have better things to do

10:04.960 --> 10:06.840
than to gossip about people.

10:07.120 --> 10:09.560
It's fun not getting what you desire.

10:09.640 --> 10:12.120
Just let me savour this pleasure alone.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.240
Miss!

10:15.520 --> 10:17.480
Zhong Xiwu...

10:17.720 --> 10:19.720
You may be Lord of the Zhong family

10:19.920 --> 10:22.400
but you're as pathetic as me

10:22.560 --> 10:25.080
because you can't get the woman you want.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.400
I am not like you.

10:34.320 --> 10:35.320
Chen Yuan.

10:38.640 --> 10:39.640
Lord.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.320
Send someone to keep an eye on her.

10:41.400 --> 10:42.400
Noted.

10:51.360 --> 10:53.560
Concubine Mu, I am Banxia, your new maid.

10:53.640 --> 10:55.240
The housekeeper sent me.

10:55.680 --> 10:57.160
Isn't Zisu coming back?

10:57.480 --> 10:59.000
The housekeeper said he couldn't contact Zisu

10:59.080 --> 11:00.960
who went back to her hometown for a visit.

11:01.040 --> 11:02.760
He was afraid that you would be short of maids

11:02.840 --> 11:04.280
so he sent me here to serve you.

11:04.360 --> 11:05.880
He'll continue sending people

11:05.960 --> 11:07.480
to look for Zisu.

11:08.080 --> 11:09.240
I see.

11:35.840 --> 11:38.120
Miss, Huang said he had news.

11:39.400 --> 11:42.000
Miss Hua, our men just sent news.

11:42.080 --> 11:43.080
They saw a man in black

11:43.160 --> 11:45.280
sneaking out of Zhong Residence.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.520
Did you find the whereabouts of that man?

12:00.720 --> 12:02.200
Yes, the figure disappeared

12:02.280 --> 12:03.640
into a room on the second floor of an inn.

12:03.720 --> 12:04.720
An inn?

12:04.840 --> 12:06.720
It's an inconspicuous inn

12:06.800 --> 12:09.000
where people of all kinds stay in it.

12:09.080 --> 12:10.240
And then?

12:10.320 --> 12:11.880
The guards who followed him were cautious

12:11.960 --> 12:13.400
and didn't confront him

12:13.480 --> 12:14.680
instead they...

12:15.160 --> 12:17.720
<i>All Around Inn</i>

12:23.600 --> 12:25.680
Sir, here's your wine. Please enjoy.

12:26.960 --> 12:28.720
—Hey, Innkeeper!                       —Sir.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.720
Do you have any vacant rooms?

12:30.800 --> 12:32.640
Just a moment. Let me check.

12:37.440 --> 12:38.600
We have vacant rooms

12:38.680 --> 12:39.840
on both the first and second floors.

12:39.920 --> 12:41.760
Which floor do you prefer?

12:42.280 --> 12:43.840
I want the leftmost room on the second floor.

12:43.920 --> 12:45.480
Sir, what would you like?

12:45.560 --> 12:46.840
—A pot of wine.                       —Sure.

12:46.920 --> 12:49.200
Unfortunately, that room is occupied.

12:49.280 --> 12:50.960
When will the room be available?

12:51.040 --> 12:52.600
I'm used to staying in that room.

12:52.680 --> 12:54.800
The guest in that room will leave tomorrow.

12:54.880 --> 12:57.720
Why don't you take the room next door?

12:57.800 --> 12:59.640
Can you get them to exchange rooms with me?

12:59.720 --> 13:01.200
I only want to stay in that room.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.800
I'm afraid this is not appropriate.

13:02.960 --> 13:04.280
Those two guests have been staying in that room

13:04.360 --> 13:05.840
for several days.

13:06.360 --> 13:07.600
Why did they stay for so long?

13:07.680 --> 13:09.800
Are they merchants?

13:10.200 --> 13:11.720
I don't know.

13:12.040 --> 13:14.320
They are probably tourists from somewhere

13:14.400 --> 13:16.000
since they had been inquiring about

13:16.080 --> 13:17.360
Donghuang Mountain in the past few days.

13:17.560 --> 13:19.840
All right. You know what to do.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.160
Got it!

13:21.800 --> 13:23.040
Donghuang Mountain?

13:31.200 --> 13:32.760
I've been reborn

13:33.160 --> 13:35.960
but his escape route remains the same.

13:37.320 --> 13:38.760
Are you sure it's tomorrow?

13:38.840 --> 13:40.920
Have our guards been spotted?

13:41.000 --> 13:43.760
Obtaining this information was effortless.

13:43.840 --> 13:44.840
Do you think the other party

13:44.920 --> 13:46.800
intentionally leaked this information to us?

13:47.040 --> 13:48.200
I don't think so.

13:48.280 --> 13:49.400
But just in case

13:49.480 --> 13:50.560
the guards who tracked down the man in black

13:50.640 --> 13:51.800
split up on purpose.

13:51.880 --> 13:53.960
One went to the counter to make some inquiry

13:54.040 --> 13:55.560
while the other sat in the lobby

13:55.640 --> 13:56.720
and pretended to be a customer

13:56.800 --> 13:57.880
to observe the surroundings.

13:57.960 --> 13:59.880
Nothing seemed out of the ordinary

13:59.960 --> 14:02.000
so I don't think it was a trap.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.200
The man in black was careless

14:03.280 --> 14:04.960
and didn't realise that he was being followed.

14:05.680 --> 14:06.800
Careless?

14:09.160 --> 14:10.520
Is it really that simple?

14:13.280 --> 14:14.280
Never mind.

14:14.360 --> 14:15.840
I'd better not forego an opportunity.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.880
At worst, I'll wait there every day.

14:17.960 --> 14:19.880
Now, go gather more men

14:19.960 --> 14:21.440
and take as many people with you as you can

14:21.520 --> 14:23.360
and set an ambush at the foot of the mountain.

14:23.640 --> 14:25.680
Go in batches.

14:25.760 --> 14:27.480
Remember to keep a low profile.

14:27.560 --> 14:29.280
Be inconspicuous when making your way there.

14:29.360 --> 14:30.480
I will be there tomorrow.

14:31.320 --> 14:32.320
Noted, Miss.

14:53.920 --> 14:55.040
Did you prepare the carriages?

14:58.760 --> 14:59.760
Let's hurry along.

15:01.320 --> 15:02.320
Get them.

15:21.240 --> 15:23.480
Miss Hua, we're making a scene.

15:23.560 --> 15:24.760
I'm afraid

15:25.080 --> 15:27.760
it will draw the attention of the soldiers.

15:28.240 --> 15:29.760
This is my intention.

15:30.120 --> 15:33.800
This will expose the mastermind.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.200
Well...

15:38.440 --> 15:39.480
Don't worry.

15:39.720 --> 15:41.640
He won't dare call for help

15:41.720 --> 15:43.160
when the city is under martial law.

16:19.960 --> 16:21.000
Master, don't worry about me.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.080
Just run!

16:23.760 --> 16:25.040
Do your worst, Hua Qian.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.880
Are you serious about killing me?

16:28.120 --> 16:29.600
Do you think you can escape punishment

16:29.680 --> 16:30.960
after murdering me?

16:32.920 --> 16:34.160
You're just an escaped slave.

16:34.240 --> 16:35.520
So what if I killed you?

16:35.720 --> 16:37.080
Don't play games with me.

16:37.640 --> 16:39.240
You clearly know who I am.

16:39.920 --> 16:41.960
Do I? Who are you then?

16:45.000 --> 16:46.840
I have the nerve to arrest you

16:46.920 --> 16:48.400
but do you dare call for help?

16:48.960 --> 16:50.480
I'll leave you to decide if you want to

16:51.080 --> 16:53.480
admit to causing harm to the Hua family.

16:56.800 --> 16:59.440
If you surrender now

16:59.600 --> 17:01.480
I'll tell the guards to stop

17:01.760 --> 17:03.520
and we can have a discussion.

17:03.920 --> 17:06.560
Otherwise, we'll fight until you die.

17:09.160 --> 17:10.200
Master...

17:11.400 --> 17:12.400
Don't.

17:50.960 --> 17:54.360
Long time no see, Junior Lord Wu.

17:59.240 --> 18:00.800
How did you know I would come here?

18:00.880 --> 18:02.640
You told me so yourself.

18:02.720 --> 18:03.720
Nonsense!

18:06.480 --> 18:09.640
I'll leave Huangcheng tomorrow

18:09.720 --> 18:10.800
via Donghuang Mountain pass.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.720
Go expose me as fast as you can.

18:12.800 --> 18:18.160
Let's see who will believe a fugitive like you.

18:19.960 --> 18:21.240
Your dull mind

18:21.320 --> 18:22.320
won't be able to figure this out.

18:25.080 --> 18:26.840
Throw them into the carriage behind mine

18:26.920 --> 18:27.920
and take them back.

18:31.280 --> 18:32.760
Go spread the word tomorrow.

18:32.960 --> 18:34.240
I want everyone in Huangcheng

18:34.320 --> 18:35.600
to hear about this.

18:35.920 --> 18:37.200
The Hua family went to great lengths

18:37.280 --> 18:38.600
and caught...

18:39.160 --> 18:40.280
an escaped slave.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.120
Noted, Miss.

18:57.280 --> 18:58.640
How dare you arrest me!

18:59.520 --> 19:00.520
Aren't you afraid of jeopardising

19:00.600 --> 19:01.920
the long-term collaboration

19:02.000 --> 19:03.640
between the Zhong family and the Wu family?

19:03.880 --> 19:05.040
Why didn't you say this

19:05.120 --> 19:07.400
when you were arrested?

19:10.640 --> 19:13.000
Junior Lord Wu appeared in Huangcheng

19:13.080 --> 19:14.480
uninvited

19:14.560 --> 19:16.200
despite the end of his study tour.

19:16.560 --> 19:18.480
If your identity is revealed

19:18.560 --> 19:21.800
wouldn't that also reveal the Wu family's plot

19:21.880 --> 19:23.520
of stealing the fragrance formula?

19:24.560 --> 19:26.240
When that happens

19:26.320 --> 19:28.440
will there still be any collaborations

19:28.520 --> 19:29.720
between the Zhong family and the Wu family?

19:29.800 --> 19:30.800
Who said I wanted to steal

19:30.880 --> 19:31.880
the fragrance formula?

19:33.640 --> 19:34.760
I just...

19:36.080 --> 19:37.960
stayed in Huangcheng for a few more days.

19:38.640 --> 19:39.800
Is that true?

19:40.360 --> 19:42.120
Then, explain why you needed

19:42.200 --> 19:44.360
to lie low in Huangcheng.

19:45.640 --> 19:49.480
Or should I hand you over to the magistracy

19:49.560 --> 19:50.560
for investigation?

19:51.000 --> 19:52.120
Hua Qian.

19:53.240 --> 19:55.400
I didn't realise how ruthless you could be.

19:55.480 --> 19:56.600
I'm ruthless?

19:56.920 --> 19:58.400
You carried out the banquet massacre

19:58.480 --> 20:00.200
and expected no one to retaliate?

20:04.520 --> 20:05.720
How do you know that?

20:26.360 --> 20:29.040
This wound seems to be almost healed.

20:29.640 --> 20:32.560
Why don't you explain how you got hurt?

20:36.120 --> 20:37.880
It seems that the person who fought with

20:38.240 --> 20:40.400
Hua Rongzhou in the valley was indeed you.

20:43.120 --> 20:44.600
I asked how you knew about it.

20:45.960 --> 20:47.560
How did I know about it?

20:48.200 --> 20:52.800
I'd say you gave yourself away.

20:53.640 --> 20:54.760
What do you mean?

20:54.840 --> 20:56.280
If it wasn't someone I knew

20:56.480 --> 20:57.920
he wouldn't know that

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Hua Rongzhou was looking for me in the valley

21:00.080 --> 21:01.640
and even told him which way to go.

21:05.920 --> 21:08.560
Or perhaps I should say

21:08.640 --> 21:10.320
Mu Yao has betrayed you?

21:14.920 --> 21:16.360
I don't know what you're talking about.

21:18.160 --> 21:20.840
You're a devoted man. How touching.

21:21.240 --> 21:22.840
I wonder if Mu Yao would be moved

21:22.920 --> 21:24.200
if she knows?

21:25.520 --> 21:28.480
What gift do you think I should give her

21:28.560 --> 21:30.160
so she would know it's you right away?

21:31.800 --> 21:32.960
A finger?

21:34.600 --> 21:35.680
An eye?

21:38.400 --> 21:39.640
Or one of your ears?

21:40.160 --> 21:41.600
You vicious woman!

21:43.000 --> 21:44.680
Why not the tongue?

21:44.760 --> 21:47.040
Nothing good comes out of your mouth anyway.

21:47.120 --> 21:48.600
Just take it out on me.

21:49.040 --> 21:51.000
I'm doing exactly that.

21:51.920 --> 21:54.960
It's your tongue I want to cut off

21:55.560 --> 21:58.560
and your finger too.

21:59.280 --> 22:02.240
It's also your eyes I want to pierce.

22:04.880 --> 22:06.680
Didn't you say that we could have a discussion

22:06.760 --> 22:07.960
if I surrendered?

22:11.040 --> 22:13.360
Have you given me a chance to talk?

22:16.000 --> 22:19.600
It's not one of my men who killed your brother

22:19.680 --> 22:20.680
at the banquet.

22:23.040 --> 22:24.080
Then who is it?

22:24.520 --> 22:25.520
I don't know either.

22:26.280 --> 22:27.880
Are you saying

22:27.960 --> 22:29.600
there was another group of assassins?

22:31.920 --> 22:32.920
Yes.

22:36.200 --> 22:37.240
Why did you pose as a member of the Ge family

22:37.320 --> 22:38.960
to carry out the assassination?

22:42.920 --> 22:45.080
Since you know how I feel about you

22:45.160 --> 22:46.640
do you trust me?

22:48.160 --> 22:49.520
Trust you to do what?

22:50.080 --> 22:51.080
I'll take you away.

22:53.600 --> 22:54.960
Why should I leave with you?

22:55.040 --> 22:56.920
Because you're the only one I love.

22:58.200 --> 23:01.280
So what? You like me

23:01.440 --> 23:02.840
and I must go with you?

23:02.920 --> 23:03.920
Are you sure you want to share

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
your husband with Hua Qian?

23:05.080 --> 23:06.080
Shut up!

23:12.240 --> 23:14.120
Don't tell me you haven't noticed

23:15.040 --> 23:16.640
that Zhong Yelan has started

23:16.720 --> 23:18.360
to have feelings for Hua Qian.

23:18.720 --> 23:21.040
He didn't agree to divorce Hua Qian at first

23:21.200 --> 23:22.200
because he knew you were going to

23:22.280 --> 23:23.520
take down Hua Qian.

23:23.600 --> 23:24.720
He wanted to make use of his position

23:24.800 --> 23:25.920
to shield Hua Qian

23:26.000 --> 23:27.320
from being implicated by the Hua family.

23:28.680 --> 23:29.680
Later on, he changed his mind

23:29.760 --> 23:30.800
and agreed to divorce Hua Qian.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.520
It wasn't because of you

23:32.960 --> 23:34.000
but because Hua Qian insisted on

23:34.080 --> 23:35.120
getting a divorce

23:35.600 --> 23:37.200
so he granted her wish.

23:42.360 --> 23:44.280
If you still have doubts

23:44.760 --> 23:46.080
why don't we make a bet?

23:46.440 --> 23:48.280
Between you and Hua Qian

23:49.240 --> 23:50.720
let's see who he will choose.

23:50.800 --> 23:51.920
Fine.

23:54.400 --> 23:55.400
How do we do it?

24:03.600 --> 24:05.480
I know the reason even if you won't tell me.

24:05.560 --> 24:07.640
Anyway, you are in my hands

24:07.920 --> 24:10.080
so let's see if Mu Yao will come find you.

24:10.160 --> 24:11.760
—Leave her alone!             —Why should I?

24:13.320 --> 24:17.360
There's nothing between Mu Yao and me.

24:18.160 --> 24:19.920
What happens to me doesn't concern her.

24:22.640 --> 24:23.840
Look at you.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.000
You're the junior lord

24:25.080 --> 24:26.240
of the largest herb supplier.

24:26.320 --> 24:28.280
You should focus on your business

24:28.720 --> 24:31.000
instead of doing stupid things.

24:31.080 --> 24:32.920
The Wu family will decline because of you.

24:34.520 --> 24:37.400
Besides, I don't care what happened

24:37.480 --> 24:39.040
between the two of you.

24:39.280 --> 24:41.680
Do you expect me to be moved by your devotion

24:41.760 --> 24:43.520
and help you two be together?

24:45.640 --> 24:47.480
So, you knew the reason.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.240
Why bother asking her again?

24:51.120 --> 24:52.560
So what if I knew?

24:53.240 --> 24:55.800
Asking her gives me room for negotiation.

24:58.600 --> 24:59.800
By the way

24:59.880 --> 25:01.680
throw the other man out.

25:01.880 --> 25:04.080
We shan't waste medicine on him.

25:04.160 --> 25:05.280
He's not worth it.

25:06.360 --> 25:08.200
You are indeed a changed person.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.600
No wonder she sensed danger.

25:25.920 --> 25:28.040
I shouldn't have made that bet.

25:29.040 --> 25:32.920
I was never going to win.

25:41.400 --> 25:43.400
Men! An intruder in Hua Residence!

25:50.080 --> 25:51.840
Go over there! Go!

25:53.840 --> 25:55.280
—Did you see him?                       —No.

25:55.360 --> 25:57.160
Let's go over there. Hurry!

26:15.080 --> 26:17.880
Someone broke into Hua Residence last night.

26:17.960 --> 26:19.840
Miss Hua, are you okay here?

26:19.920 --> 26:21.120
Did you catch him?

26:22.160 --> 26:23.160
No.

26:23.720 --> 26:24.840
What?

26:25.520 --> 26:27.400
The guards in this house are useless.

26:27.480 --> 26:29.920
They couldn't even catch a random intruder.

26:34.400 --> 26:35.400
How about this?

26:35.480 --> 26:39.080
Go tell my father that I feel disturbed

26:39.160 --> 26:40.720
due to the intruder

26:40.800 --> 26:41.960
and I don't think I'm able to sleep well

26:42.040 --> 26:43.200
in the next few days.

26:43.280 --> 26:44.760
So, he should borrow a few guards

26:44.840 --> 26:46.360
from Magistrate Wang

26:46.440 --> 26:49.360
for around half a month.

26:52.200 --> 26:54.400
Noted. I'll inform Butler Hua right away.

27:06.400 --> 27:08.160
Your injury healed just in time

27:08.240 --> 27:10.000
and you were able to help me with the task.

27:10.440 --> 27:11.480
Rest assured, Miss.

27:11.560 --> 27:13.360
No one knows what happened last night.

27:13.600 --> 27:15.000
I have no doubt about your agility.

27:18.440 --> 27:19.520
Magistrate Wang's guards

27:19.600 --> 27:20.680
belong to the government.

27:20.760 --> 27:22.160
Even if they may not be skilled

27:22.240 --> 27:24.360
they're not mere guards of Hua Residence.

27:24.640 --> 27:28.240
Whoever has plans to spy on Hua Residence

27:28.400 --> 27:30.280
is going to think twice.

27:34.160 --> 27:37.240
You look nice in this colour.

27:48.360 --> 27:50.400
Thank you for coming.

27:50.480 --> 27:51.720
Huang, you don't have to be so polite.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.120
This way, please.

27:56.120 --> 27:58.360
<i>Zhong Residence</i>

28:08.840 --> 28:09.880
Who's there?

28:18.120 --> 28:19.840
I let you go.

28:19.920 --> 28:21.160
Why did you come back?

28:21.320 --> 28:24.320
Concubine Mu, Hua Qian captured my master.

28:27.880 --> 28:29.160
Is it the escaped slave

28:29.240 --> 28:30.720
that she claimed she captured?

28:30.800 --> 28:31.800
Yes.

28:31.880 --> 28:33.000
Guard Cang managed to escape.

28:33.080 --> 28:34.200
He sent us the information

28:34.680 --> 28:36.080
so we're sure it's true.

28:36.520 --> 28:38.040
Your master's whereabouts were a secret.

28:38.120 --> 28:39.800
Even I didn't know.

28:39.880 --> 28:41.560
How did Hua Qian find out?

28:42.360 --> 28:43.760
We don't know either.

28:46.960 --> 28:49.160
Why did you come to see me today?

28:49.240 --> 28:50.280
Hua Residence now has

28:50.360 --> 28:51.400
magistracy guards keeping watch.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.480
If we barge in to rescue him

28:53.560 --> 28:55.080
we might alert them.

28:55.880 --> 28:56.880
So?

28:58.080 --> 28:59.400
Master has told us repeatedly

28:59.480 --> 29:01.200
not to disturb you

29:01.360 --> 29:03.160
but the matter is urgent.

29:03.480 --> 29:05.760
Concubine Mu, please save our master.

29:12.280 --> 29:14.360
I brought it upon your master.

29:15.400 --> 29:16.400
Don't worry.

29:17.520 --> 29:18.880
I won't leave him in the lurch.

29:20.920 --> 29:22.080
Go back now.

29:23.560 --> 29:25.040
Trust me to...

29:25.880 --> 29:28.240
bring your master to you in one piece.

29:29.560 --> 29:31.920
Thank you, Concubine Mu!

29:51.760 --> 29:53.360
Mu Yao...

29:55.600 --> 29:58.680
What led you to become what you despise?

30:07.960 --> 30:08.960
Miss.

30:09.160 --> 30:10.480
Magistrate Wang's guards have been here

30:10.560 --> 30:11.880
for almost a week.

30:11.960 --> 30:14.280
And it has been pretty peaceful in here.

30:14.360 --> 30:15.360
I heard from Huang

30:15.440 --> 30:17.160
that they were talking about leaving.

30:19.120 --> 30:20.880
This is unexpected.

30:21.160 --> 30:23.600
It was surprising how patient they were.

30:24.320 --> 30:27.120
Miss, have you figured out what to do next?

30:38.280 --> 30:39.280
Miss.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.480
Miss Meng sent you another invitation card.

30:41.560 --> 30:42.600
<i>Meng Yifei</i>

30:42.680 --> 30:44.600
Miss, are you still going to

30:44.680 --> 30:46.080
decline her invitation?

30:51.360 --> 30:52.880
I have nothing to do anyway.

30:52.960 --> 30:54.240
Let's go out for a walk.

31:01.320 --> 31:02.400
Miss Hua, please have a seat.

31:08.920 --> 31:10.040
Come and taste this tea.

31:10.320 --> 31:11.320
This is the Dragon Musk tea

31:11.400 --> 31:14.160
that my father brought for me from the south.

31:14.520 --> 31:15.680
I'm grateful that he thinks of me

31:15.760 --> 31:16.920
despite being occupied with work.

31:17.440 --> 31:20.480
I don't serve it to just anyone.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.640
I'm so lucky.

31:27.440 --> 31:30.240
After you left Zhong's Garden that day

31:30.320 --> 31:32.400
I was hoping we could talk again.

31:32.640 --> 31:33.640
Unfortunately, you kept declining my invitation

31:33.720 --> 31:34.720
saying you were busy.

31:35.600 --> 31:38.120
I finally got my wish fulfilled today.

31:38.320 --> 31:40.040
I'm sorry, Miss Meng.

31:40.120 --> 31:42.760
I was rather busy lately.

31:42.840 --> 31:43.920
Really?

31:44.000 --> 31:46.480
I thought that was an excuse.

31:46.720 --> 31:48.280
So, what are you busy with?

31:49.360 --> 31:50.520
Coincidentally

31:50.600 --> 31:52.760
I caught a fugitive a few days ago

31:52.840 --> 31:54.680
when I was looking for an escaped slave.

31:54.760 --> 31:56.080
And it turned out the fugitive was involved

31:56.160 --> 31:57.320
in the banquet assassination that happened

31:57.400 --> 31:58.560
a few days ago.

31:59.920 --> 32:02.000
So, I have been busy

32:02.080 --> 32:04.480
trying to find out what he knows.

32:05.120 --> 32:06.520
That's good.

32:06.680 --> 32:07.920
Hopefully, the murderer will get convicted

32:08.000 --> 32:09.400
and receive the punishment he deserves.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.800
I hope so too, Miss Meng.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.400
It's rare that you come here.

32:13.480 --> 32:15.600
We must have a good time.

32:15.680 --> 32:18.120
People come and go in Zhong's Garden

32:18.200 --> 32:19.880
but I rarely meet someone like you

32:19.960 --> 32:21.240
whom I can chat with.

32:22.720 --> 32:27.040
I thought you and Miss Qi were very close?

32:27.840 --> 32:30.920
Sis Qi seems like a different person these days.

32:31.400 --> 32:33.400
But she won't tell me what happened.

32:34.040 --> 32:35.960
She must have been dealt a great blow

32:36.040 --> 32:37.960
that caused her to be in this state.

32:39.360 --> 32:42.360
The truth is, Sis Qi has a sharp tongue

32:42.720 --> 32:45.920
and may be harsh with her words

32:46.320 --> 32:49.280
but she means well.

32:49.800 --> 32:51.400
Sometimes the more she feels guilty

32:51.480 --> 32:52.960
towards someone

32:53.040 --> 32:55.160
the harsher she is with her words.

32:56.440 --> 32:57.560
Guilty?

32:58.960 --> 33:00.440
I was just citing an example.

33:04.040 --> 33:05.200
What about you?

33:05.720 --> 33:07.960
I don't know what's special about me

33:08.040 --> 33:10.400
that makes you think of me differently.

33:11.520 --> 33:15.080
I can see it clearly even when others can't.

33:16.080 --> 33:17.480
I felt that you stood apart from the rest

33:17.560 --> 33:19.000
ever since the first time I saw you.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.920
And you escaped assassination twice.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.320
After bad luck comes good fortune.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.160
My father is Head Butler of the Zhong family's

33:29.240 --> 33:31.400
business in the south

33:31.920 --> 33:33.440
while your father is Head Butler

33:33.520 --> 33:34.520
of the Zhong family.

33:34.880 --> 33:37.320
If we can look after each other in the future

33:37.920 --> 33:39.560
then our standing in Zhong's garden

33:39.720 --> 33:42.320
will be strengthened.

33:44.560 --> 33:45.720
Miss Meng, I don't understand

33:45.800 --> 33:46.960
what you are talking about.

33:48.720 --> 33:50.960
You're a smart girl.

33:51.040 --> 33:53.120
Surely you understand what I'm talking about.

33:55.160 --> 33:56.480
Lord has feelings for you.

33:56.560 --> 33:59.040
I've been there so I know.

34:00.240 --> 34:02.600
There will be many opportunities

34:02.680 --> 34:03.840
where you and I can work together.

34:03.920 --> 34:06.400
Miss Meng, don't make fun of me.

34:06.480 --> 34:07.720
All right...

34:07.800 --> 34:09.440
I won't make fun of you anymore.

34:09.520 --> 34:12.160
Anyway, there's a long way ahead of us.

34:15.720 --> 34:16.760
Let's have tea.

34:17.600 --> 34:18.600
Okay.

34:26.720 --> 34:29.040
Sis Hua, come here wherever you're free.

34:47.160 --> 34:49.760
It's dirty. Just throw it away.

34:50.040 --> 34:51.360
Yes, Miss.

35:38.080 --> 35:41.000
Master, I saw where Concubine Mu was headed.

35:41.080 --> 35:42.800
She seemed to be going to Hua Residence.

35:43.960 --> 35:45.880
Master, Magistrate Wang's guards

35:45.960 --> 35:47.120
are still in Hua Residence.

35:47.200 --> 35:48.760
It would be unwise for

35:48.840 --> 35:50.040
Concubine Mu to go there alone.

35:50.720 --> 35:52.000
With her agility

35:52.400 --> 35:54.200
avoiding those guards won't pose a challenge.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.040
I believe Concubine Mu is going there

35:56.120 --> 35:59.560
to see Mistress... I mean, Miss Hua.

35:59.720 --> 36:01.360
Master, are you sure you'll ignore this?

36:01.440 --> 36:02.680
Why should I care?

36:03.160 --> 36:05.000
It's between them.

36:05.080 --> 36:06.640
No one else should intervene.

36:06.720 --> 36:09.000
But...

36:14.120 --> 36:15.120
When Hua Qian left

36:15.200 --> 36:16.720
she only took her belongings.

36:17.440 --> 36:18.680
She didn't take the zither, chess

36:18.760 --> 36:20.040
ink brush and ink stone that I gave her.

36:21.360 --> 36:24.120
Send them to her when you have time.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Noted, Master.

36:27.680 --> 36:28.680
Consider it done.

36:35.240 --> 36:36.400
Miss...

36:36.880 --> 36:38.560
Are you flustered just because I didn't take you

36:38.640 --> 36:40.000
to Zhong's Garden?

36:44.120 --> 36:45.480
Go and tell the chef

36:45.560 --> 36:46.800
to make a few more dishes for dinner.

36:46.880 --> 36:48.040
We'll eat together.

36:48.120 --> 36:49.120
Yes, Miss.

36:53.360 --> 36:54.960
Miss, Mu Yao is here.

37:28.720 --> 37:30.440
How did it feel to climb over walls?

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
Where is he?

37:32.400 --> 37:33.520
Who?

37:33.600 --> 37:34.840
Don't play dumb with me.

37:39.960 --> 37:41.320
What's the hurry?

37:41.880 --> 37:43.280
You came here uninvited

37:43.720 --> 37:45.040
and I just came back.

37:45.240 --> 37:48.680
Can't I drink some water and catch my breath?

37:52.960 --> 37:54.160
You freed his guard on purpose.

37:54.240 --> 37:56.160
You wanted him to inform me, didn't you?

37:56.240 --> 37:58.160
I don't have time to play games with you.

37:58.440 --> 38:00.640
I have come as you wish.

38:00.720 --> 38:02.640
Can you let him go now?

38:02.720 --> 38:04.560
How did the cup offend you?

38:05.240 --> 38:06.760
From where did you pick up

38:06.840 --> 38:08.360
the bad habit of breaking cups?

38:08.640 --> 38:10.920
You need to kick the habit.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.280
Hua Qian!

38:15.640 --> 38:16.800
Since you know that

38:16.880 --> 38:18.440
you're here to beg me for help

38:18.520 --> 38:20.840
shouldn't you be more polite?

38:24.080 --> 38:25.520
I'm here now.

38:25.600 --> 38:27.400
Do whatever you want to me.

38:27.640 --> 38:30.000
Just let him go. He has nothing to do with this.

38:32.480 --> 38:33.720
He has nothing to do with this?

38:34.480 --> 38:37.640
Mu Yao, the cheek of you

38:37.720 --> 38:38.840
to utter those word.

38:39.720 --> 38:42.640
Are you saying Wu Shuomo was not involved

38:42.720 --> 38:44.320
in the banquet assassination?

38:44.840 --> 38:48.480
And the kidnapping incident at the cliff too?

38:51.560 --> 38:53.920
I was the mastermind

38:54.920 --> 38:56.800
and he was just a pawn.

38:58.680 --> 38:59.880
That's true.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.360
One came up with some plans

39:02.440 --> 39:03.840
hoping to find an answer

39:03.920 --> 39:05.600
while the other waited at the cliff foot

39:05.680 --> 39:07.320
thinking he could win the heart of his beloved.

39:07.400 --> 39:10.320
How should I define the two of you?

39:10.400 --> 39:11.800
Ridiculous or pathetic?

39:11.880 --> 39:13.920
—Why would you...                 —Next time

39:14.000 --> 39:15.880
be sure to brush up your acting.

39:16.120 --> 39:18.000
It is improbable for someone

39:18.080 --> 39:19.640
to display no signs of shock or fear

39:19.720 --> 39:21.520
upon awakening to discover herself

39:21.600 --> 39:22.600
hanging off the edge of a cliff.

39:27.200 --> 39:28.560
Fine.

39:30.120 --> 39:32.800
If you want revenge, come at me.

39:34.520 --> 39:36.880
Aren't you loyal to each other?

39:36.960 --> 39:38.440
Both of you are vying to take responsibility

39:38.520 --> 39:40.040
upon yourselves.

39:40.720 --> 39:42.840
Why does it sound like

39:43.000 --> 39:45.840
I'm the villain again this time?

39:49.360 --> 39:51.920
Has Zhong Yelan become insignificant

39:52.000 --> 39:53.480
to you now?

39:53.560 --> 39:55.960
You took him from me

39:56.400 --> 39:57.560
and now you think I let him down?

39:57.640 --> 39:58.640
Don't be a hypocrite.

39:58.720 --> 39:59.840
I took him from you?

40:00.760 --> 40:02.840
I made you his concubine

40:02.920 --> 40:04.200
and took the initiative to get a divorce.

40:04.280 --> 40:06.160
What more do you want me to do?

40:06.760 --> 40:10.200
Mu Yao, I thought you were smart.

40:10.280 --> 40:12.520
How could you be so foolish?

40:15.920 --> 40:17.360
Yes, I was foolish enough to think

40:18.720 --> 40:21.200
I could sound him out that way.

40:21.760 --> 40:23.640
Didn't you try

40:23.720 --> 40:24.880
to destroy everything I owned?

40:26.040 --> 40:28.080
You have succeeded.

40:28.720 --> 40:31.120
He has started to develop feelings for you.

40:34.480 --> 40:37.560
How stupid I must have been

40:38.400 --> 40:40.200
to have lost to you previously.

40:40.280 --> 40:42.040
You are proud and egoistic.

40:42.120 --> 40:43.120
You would rather suffer

40:43.200 --> 40:44.320
than lose your dignity.

40:44.400 --> 40:45.760
You always blame others but yourself

40:45.840 --> 40:47.080
when things go wrong.

40:47.240 --> 40:51.000
Is Zhong Yelan the only man in this vast world?

40:51.080 --> 40:52.840
Can't you live without him?

40:52.920 --> 40:54.640
You live in such a small world!

40:54.720 --> 40:56.200
Who are you to criticise me?

40:56.960 --> 40:58.720
Weren't you the same?

41:17.360 --> 41:20.200
Master, I've led the Hua family's guards there.

41:21.280 --> 41:22.280
Good.

41:23.680 --> 41:25.560
What should I do next?

41:25.960 --> 41:27.440
Nothing.

41:29.320 --> 41:30.320
Yes, Master.
