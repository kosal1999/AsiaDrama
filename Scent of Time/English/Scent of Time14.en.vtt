01:39.240 --> 01:40.560
Come eat this

01:40.640 --> 01:42.160
That's enough...you need to eat more too.

01:42.240 --> 01:44.320
Madam, what happened to Mr. Fahrenheit?

01:50.640 --> 01:51.960
I ate it a bit hastily.

01:52.040 --> 01:53.040
Please excuse me first.

01:53.640 --> 01:54.840
Why did you just leave?

01:54.920 --> 01:56.160
are you okay… you eat

01:57.600 --> 01:58.600
Watch here

02:00.240 --> 02:01.880
What happened?

02:01.960 --> 02:03.440
-Yeah
-It’s okay‥

02:03.520 --> 02:05.000
Now it's time to eat, time to drink

02:05.880 --> 02:07.040
another bottle of wine

02:07.120 --> 02:08.120
Let's eat ours

02:09.120 --> 02:10.160
What happened to my brother?

02:10.920 --> 02:12.240
Fahrenheit is now......

02:13.120 --> 02:14.640
In Mu Xiaoniang’s room

02:16.600 --> 02:17.600
What does it mean?

02:17.680 --> 02:18.960
I don't even know the species

02:19.040 --> 02:20.600
I just heard someone report it.

02:20.920 --> 02:23.440
Mr. Hua said that he broke into Mu Xiaoniang’s room.

02:38.960 --> 02:40.640
brother… wake up

02:41.200 --> 02:42.200
Go see Muyao

02:42.760 --> 02:44.040
brother ‥

02:44.120 --> 02:45.280
little daughter

02:47.240 --> 02:48.720
brother ‥

02:48.800 --> 02:49.800
wake up

02:50.240 --> 02:51.240
brother

02:53.280 --> 02:54.400
younger sister

03:01.040 --> 03:02.080
blood

03:02.160 --> 03:03.160
What happen?

03:11.400 --> 03:12.480
Ouch

03:14.440 --> 03:15.760
Are you okay?

03:15.840 --> 03:16.840
uncle

03:20.520 --> 03:21.520
I'm doing great

03:22.600 --> 03:24.360
Fortunately, the perilla seeds arrived just in time.

03:25.320 --> 03:26.320
just now‥

03:26.760 --> 03:28.640
I just missed you

03:29.080 --> 03:31.240
It looks like Mr. Hwa is injured.

03:39.760 --> 03:41.800
uncle‥

03:41.880 --> 03:43.600
Calm down and listen to me first.

03:44.480 --> 03:46.800
Big lady ‥

03:47.400 --> 03:48.960
Madam, are you okay?

03:49.040 --> 03:50.080
I look at my hands.

03:52.520 --> 03:53.520
bleeding

04:10.440 --> 04:12.160
-Hua Rongzhou
-Uncle

04:12.680 --> 04:14.520
Get out of the way, uncle, listen to me.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.560
Just calm down. The situation is unclear right now.

04:16.640 --> 04:18.480
I am afraid that there is no room for impulsive movement.

04:18.560 --> 04:19.760
Get out of the way

04:19.840 --> 04:21.840
Uncle, I can't kill him now.

04:21.920 --> 04:23.600
Let's first investigate the cause of the problem

04:23.680 --> 04:24.760
It's not too late to punish

04:24.840 --> 04:26.520
Find out why?

04:27.240 --> 04:28.280
How is your personality?

04:28.360 --> 04:29.560
Don’t you even know it yourself?

04:30.520 --> 04:31.760
Let me tell you why I have good intentions

04:31.840 --> 04:33.280
Go and ask the big princess for ayao.

04:34.320 --> 04:35.800
Now it seems

04:35.880 --> 04:38.080
It's just that you, brothers and sisters, have already made plans together.

04:39.160 --> 04:41.600
I know I have fooled you many times before.

04:41.680 --> 04:43.880
No wonder my uncle doesn't trust me anymore

04:43.960 --> 04:45.240
But one thing comes together

04:45.320 --> 04:47.280
-Uncle, calm down
. -You don't have to kill him.

04:47.960 --> 04:49.840
But you have to destroy both his arms

04:49.920 --> 04:51.560
Please let me know who I shouldn't touch.

04:52.440 --> 04:53.720
younger sister‥

04:53.800 --> 04:55.400
Save me, sister

04:55.480 --> 04:56.480
Sister, please save me

04:56.960 --> 04:58.120
younger sister

04:59.960 --> 05:01.080
It's not in the way, right?

05:03.240 --> 05:04.240
younger sister

05:18.960 --> 05:20.280
younger sister‥

05:34.320 --> 05:35.760
Brother, I think you'd better calm down.

05:48.280 --> 05:49.320
how?

05:49.400 --> 05:50.720
Brother, this look

05:50.800 --> 05:52.400
Could it be that you want to fight with me?

06:03.640 --> 06:04.920
What does owner mean?

06:06.080 --> 06:07.920
Are you going to defend that loser?

06:10.640 --> 06:13.240
Huashen is Huadu Guan's only son.

06:15.040 --> 06:16.480
Brother, I understand how you feel.

06:16.560 --> 06:18.400
But it's better not to lose heart

06:21.960 --> 06:24.560
He dared to be rude to my girl today.

06:24.640 --> 06:26.920
Could it be that his identity has become his protective umbrella?

06:27.480 --> 06:29.440
I'm not trying to protect that person.

06:29.520 --> 06:30.800
In my opinion

06:30.880 --> 06:32.640
Better to put him in jail first.

06:32.720 --> 06:35.920
Please wait until Magistrate Wang Hyeon finds out clearly and finds you guilty of the crime.

06:41.760 --> 06:43.840
I have more important things to do today

06:45.920 --> 06:46.920
A senior is watching

06:47.560 --> 06:49.480
Magistrate Wang County did not dare to indulge Hua Shen.

07:04.520 --> 07:05.920
it's easier for him

07:41.520 --> 07:42.600
What are you doing?

07:42.680 --> 07:43.840
Where are you taking me?

07:43.920 --> 07:45.560
Sister, please save me, sister

07:45.640 --> 07:47.040
Thank you, Master.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.280
Now you return to the yard to treat your wounds.

07:54.800 --> 07:57.280
- But there are a lot of people in the front yard.
- I will take care of the front yard.

07:57.800 --> 07:58.800
You can go back safely.

08:00.960 --> 08:01.960
farewell to the head of the household

08:03.480 --> 08:04.480
oldest woman

08:06.200 --> 08:07.200
oldest woman

08:11.240 --> 08:12.360
Are you okay?

08:12.800 --> 08:13.920
I'm doing great

08:15.520 --> 08:16.520
sorry

08:17.520 --> 08:18.560
I'm sorry ma'am

08:19.520 --> 08:21.120
What do you mean you're sorry?

08:21.200 --> 08:22.240
Very good job

08:22.320 --> 08:23.760
I should be thankful

08:24.200 --> 08:26.920
Hearing your voice, I still have some strength left.

08:27.360 --> 08:28.640
I feel at ease now

08:28.720 --> 08:31.040
Don't forget to ask your doctor to prescribe a good medicine for you later

08:33.560 --> 08:34.560
attentive

08:41.720 --> 08:42.760
come

09:31.040 --> 09:32.320
send this to her

09:49.880 --> 09:51.400
Please bear with me, ma’am.

09:55.600 --> 09:56.600
It hurts so much

09:57.560 --> 09:58.600
Be patient

09:58.680 --> 09:59.680
It'll be okay soon

10:08.360 --> 10:09.600
The slave met his master

10:11.360 --> 10:12.760
-Lyrics‥ -
I will do it.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.040
Teacher, what are you doing?

10:18.520 --> 10:20.920
Do not worry. Guests are placed in the front yard.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.200
Everyone is leaving

10:23.520 --> 10:24.560
House owner

10:24.640 --> 10:25.960
Let's do it to the ginkgo tree

10:33.360 --> 10:35.200
Don’t you trust my medical skills?

10:35.280 --> 10:36.320
no

10:36.400 --> 10:39.000
I just think it's against etiquette.

11:07.840 --> 11:11.480
Master, why don't you knock me out and treat my wounds?

11:13.520 --> 11:14.960
'Cause you're so afraid of pain

11:15.040 --> 11:17.240
Why are you standing in front of Hua Shen?

11:21.240 --> 11:22.520
That person is my brother after all

12:00.760 --> 12:02.400
Why are you so fast? I just…

12:11.440 --> 12:13.440
I'll put this aside for now.

12:13.520 --> 12:14.800
but you need to know

12:14.880 --> 12:17.440
In the end, you have to give the answer.

12:17.520 --> 12:19.360
My uncle was so angry.

12:19.760 --> 12:20.920
Isn't the head of the household angry?

12:21.520 --> 12:23.040
Why should I be angry?

12:23.120 --> 12:24.600
Why did my landlord help me?

12:27.640 --> 12:29.600
Didn't you test me every day before?

12:31.400 --> 12:33.400
Because you helped me protect mine...

12:34.880 --> 12:36.040
secret of my heart

12:36.680 --> 12:38.840
Then we can be considered people in the same boat.

12:39.560 --> 12:40.840
how boring he is

12:40.920 --> 12:43.280
If you like someone else, should you find someone to share it with?

12:46.320 --> 12:48.240
Okay, I'll go first.

13:07.440 --> 13:08.440
oldest woman

13:09.160 --> 13:11.000
Now when I told the doctor to get me some medicine

13:11.080 --> 13:14.960
When he saw guard Hua taking a bottle of trauma medicine,
he hurriedly ran out.

13:15.040 --> 13:17.160
He didn't even hear me greet him.

13:17.240 --> 13:18.880
I don't know how serious his injuries are.

13:19.680 --> 13:20.920
When I just got back

13:21.000 --> 13:22.440
I saw that person at the door too

13:23.280 --> 13:25.040
Was Hualongzhou also injured?

13:25.920 --> 13:26.920
I do not know either

13:28.120 --> 13:29.440
I didn't look closely right now.

13:30.040 --> 13:31.960
he fell on a chair

13:32.040 --> 13:33.280
It looks like it has some scratches.

13:34.520 --> 13:35.520
green bamboo

13:36.400 --> 13:38.400
Why don't you go to Hua Rongzhou and check it out for me?

13:45.400 --> 13:46.600
What is happening to this girl?

13:47.160 --> 13:48.600
If you get a chance on a weekday

13:48.680 --> 13:50.320
Isn’t everyone so happy that they want to go to heaven?

13:50.400 --> 13:52.520
Why aren't you happy today?

13:52.600 --> 13:54.760
Could it be because he was worried about the guard, Fahrenheit?

13:58.520 --> 13:59.840
Why don't you put the medicine away first?

14:19.240 --> 14:20.560
oldest woman

14:20.640 --> 14:22.520
do you feel

14:22.600 --> 14:25.280
Do you feel like your landlord is treating you differently?

14:25.760 --> 14:26.840
It's definitely different

14:28.360 --> 14:30.560
So, madam, what are you going to do?

14:33.040 --> 14:34.040
you don't understand

14:34.520 --> 14:36.320
The landlord is just like that.

14:37.320 --> 14:38.600
I know his secret.

14:39.040 --> 14:40.840
So you look at me differently

14:40.920 --> 14:42.040
secret?

14:42.120 --> 14:43.760
What does eldest ajumma mean?

14:43.840 --> 14:45.000
They say it's a secret

14:45.080 --> 14:46.080
Why are you still asking?

15:04.600 --> 15:05.600
Qian Er

15:06.440 --> 15:07.440
What did your uncle say?

15:10.640 --> 15:12.400
I haven't had time to see my uncle yet.

15:12.840 --> 15:14.520
I asked your father last night

15:15.520 --> 15:17.840
The person who asked his uncle to send him to Yamen

15:18.280 --> 15:19.320
That's why...

15:19.920 --> 15:21.360
Such a shameful thing

15:21.800 --> 15:23.560
Your father is afraid of this problem becoming bigger.

15:23.640 --> 15:25.840
So I don't dare step forward and protect you.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.920
We just have to ask more questions.

15:29.800 --> 15:30.800
i know it well

15:30.880 --> 15:32.920
What good is it to know what you know?

15:34.280 --> 15:36.160
Your brother grew up eating good clothes and good food.

15:37.160 --> 15:38.920
How can he survive in prison?

15:39.400 --> 15:41.480
He's never experienced pain like that

15:42.960 --> 15:44.440
I won't sit still

15:44.520 --> 15:46.920
But first we need to get to the bottom of this problem.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.160
Only then can I explain.

15:50.080 --> 15:51.760
Yesterday when your brother was taken away

15:51.840 --> 15:53.080
i'm not here

15:53.160 --> 15:55.520
Why don't you quit?

15:55.600 --> 15:57.680
He is your only biological brother

15:59.160 --> 16:01.800
I remember when you were still in my belly

16:01.880 --> 16:03.520
That person touches my stomach every day and says

16:03.600 --> 16:05.560
Come out quickly...

16:05.640 --> 16:07.000
Brother protect me

16:07.080 --> 16:08.960
Now something big has happened to your brother

16:09.040 --> 16:11.160
Can you sit here steadily?

16:11.840 --> 16:12.880
Mom, don't worry

16:12.960 --> 16:14.480
If my younger brother was really treated unfairly

16:14.560 --> 16:16.240
I will never stay still.

16:16.320 --> 16:17.640
Then you didn't go to jail to ask questions.

16:17.720 --> 16:19.480
Who on earth did wrong to your brother?

16:20.360 --> 16:21.440
i went

16:21.520 --> 16:22.920
I found Magistrate Wang Hyeon.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.520
He won't let me in

16:24.600 --> 16:26.440
They said it would take a few days to watch.

16:26.520 --> 16:27.520
within a few days

16:28.360 --> 16:29.640
i miss myself deeply

16:29.720 --> 16:31.800
I can't spend a day in jail

16:33.120 --> 16:34.480
How could he live there?

16:35.400 --> 16:37.840
Anyway, it's up to you‥

16:37.920 --> 16:39.560
This is what happened here with you.

16:39.640 --> 16:41.240
You are my uncle's eldest wife.

16:41.320 --> 16:42.320
you go and find him

16:42.400 --> 16:44.200
I don't believe he won't let you in

16:44.280 --> 16:45.640
My brother was just arrested.

16:45.720 --> 16:48.560
Now I don't even know what happened yesterday.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.360
What good is going to jail now?

16:50.440 --> 16:52.920
-What can you do?
-So what can you do here?

16:53.400 --> 16:54.440
i know

16:54.520 --> 16:56.960
You always hated your brother because he was the one who insulted you.

16:57.040 --> 16:58.240
It's not you who's in jail now.

16:58.320 --> 16:59.400
It's not you who suffers.

16:59.480 --> 17:00.600
Of course, don't rush.

17:02.720 --> 17:04.240
I think my brother would be embarrassed

17:04.320 --> 17:06.640
Or are you embarrassed by your own bad behavior?

17:06.720 --> 17:08.080
I have never been to jail.

17:08.160 --> 17:09.800
But what good is worrying now?

17:09.880 --> 17:12.000
Make a fuss before the problem is resolved

17:12.080 --> 17:13.280
It just makes people grab the handle.

17:14.560 --> 17:16.360
And how did Mom know this?

17:16.440 --> 17:18.360
Is it my brother's fault?

17:19.320 --> 17:20.640
Mom is coming home from today

17:20.720 --> 17:21.880
keep talking

17:21.960 --> 17:23.840
I'm worried that my brother will have a hard time in prison.

17:23.920 --> 17:24.920
Did your mom ask?

17:25.000 --> 17:27.480
Why is your hand bandaged?

17:31.640 --> 17:34.080
-Me‥ -
Forget it, mom was always biased.

17:34.160 --> 17:35.360
i am used to it

17:35.440 --> 17:37.840
If mom doesn't give you a satisfactory answer today,

17:37.920 --> 17:39.600
I'm afraid you won't be able to let me go easily

17:40.160 --> 17:42.000
Now go to jail

17:42.640 --> 17:43.960
Ask more clearly

17:44.040 --> 17:45.520
Who framed your brother?

17:49.080 --> 17:50.280
ma'am

17:50.360 --> 17:53.400
What I just said was a bit heartbreaking.

17:54.880 --> 17:57.000
If you care, you will become confused and no longer in control.

17:57.080 --> 17:58.520
Rescue Shen'er first

18:02.560 --> 18:04.320
arrive

18:04.400 --> 18:05.640
younger sister‥

18:06.200 --> 18:08.000
Sister, why are you here?

18:08.080 --> 18:10.800
I was trapped for a day and a night

18:10.880 --> 18:13.280
Brother, haven’t you figured out the situation yet?

18:13.360 --> 18:15.200
I just came in really hard.

18:15.280 --> 18:16.800
Mom is still blocked from the outside world.

18:16.880 --> 18:18.520
So are you here to take me away?

18:18.600 --> 18:19.600
huh?

18:20.720 --> 18:22.840
Brother, you are thinking too simply.

18:22.920 --> 18:24.360
How many times have I said this?

18:24.440 --> 18:25.640
Mu Yao is not someone you can touch.

18:25.720 --> 18:27.520
Why don't you have a long memory?

18:27.600 --> 18:28.960
What my sister said

18:29.040 --> 18:30.800
i keep that in mind

18:30.880 --> 18:31.880
The person you spoke to cannot move

18:31.960 --> 18:34.240
Even if you die, you won't dare change your mind.

18:34.320 --> 18:36.120
Why doesn't my sister believe me?

18:36.200 --> 18:37.800
So what happened yesterday?

18:37.880 --> 18:40.320
Why did you show up in Mu Yao’s room looking disheveled?

18:42.120 --> 18:43.440
Me, I don’t know either.

18:43.920 --> 18:46.200
I drank too much yesterday

18:46.280 --> 18:47.640
Waking up in the backyard

18:47.720 --> 18:51.040
My sister's housekeeper also sent me a message telling me to be patient.

18:51.120 --> 18:52.240
don't move

18:52.320 --> 18:54.200
I was always in that pavilion

18:54.280 --> 18:55.280
Don't you dare move

18:58.120 --> 18:59.240
And after that?

18:59.320 --> 19:01.880
Later......I

19:02.560 --> 19:04.640
I think my brother would like to stay here a few more days.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.520
I said...

19:07.880 --> 19:10.760
I saw it later in the backyard.

19:11.240 --> 19:13.600
I saw a servant girl who gave birth to a good child.

19:13.680 --> 19:15.960
She rejected me and welcomed me

19:16.040 --> 19:19.160
I was drunk and chased her around.

19:19.240 --> 19:21.080
As a result, I just entered the courtyard.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.520
he lost consciousness

19:23.080 --> 19:26.120
When I woke up, I saw you, my sister, appearing before me.

19:27.680 --> 19:29.640
I was so scared that I didn't dare say anything.

19:29.720 --> 19:31.280
me‥

19:31.360 --> 19:35.320
Are you sure that the maid took the initiative to seduce you?

19:35.400 --> 19:37.000
That person keeps spying on me

19:37.080 --> 19:38.760
Aren’t you just interested in me?

19:41.120 --> 19:43.040
When people see you, they are interested in you.

19:43.120 --> 19:45.000
I drank too much and my lewd nature came out.

19:45.080 --> 19:46.160
Are you still making excuses?

19:46.240 --> 19:48.520
Who can care about themselves when they're drunk?

19:49.280 --> 19:52.000
Maybe I drank too much and my eyesight was bad.

19:52.080 --> 19:53.120
not seeing clearly

19:53.200 --> 19:55.560
So I thought other people were interested in me.

19:55.640 --> 19:59.040
This time, I accidentally broke into someone else's yard and
was treated like a villain.

19:59.120 --> 20:01.120
Sister, it's not my fault

20:02.360 --> 20:05.240
I think he's very confident in what he says.

20:05.320 --> 20:07.640
There is no trace of sadness in my mother's words.

20:07.720 --> 20:08.960
That's right, but

20:09.320 --> 20:10.640
Brother, please stay here for a few more days.

20:10.720 --> 20:12.480
-Save your memories
-Sister‥

20:13.120 --> 20:14.400
Sister, please save me

20:14.480 --> 20:15.880
It's dirty and smelly in here.

20:15.960 --> 20:17.440
and rat

20:17.520 --> 20:20.800
The guards here also tortured me.

20:20.880 --> 20:24.560
I don't think you'll survive after a few days, sister.

20:25.120 --> 20:26.720
-Sister
-Really?

20:26.800 --> 20:28.400
I saw a wound on my brother's head

20:28.480 --> 20:30.160
Good bandage.

20:30.240 --> 20:32.200
Where else were you abused by the guards?

20:32.280 --> 20:35.200
-I...
-Just stay here and remember me for a long time.

20:35.280 --> 20:38.560
younger sister‥

20:38.640 --> 20:40.080
sisters

20:41.680 --> 20:42.680
younger sister

20:56.040 --> 20:57.240
How is your brother?

21:07.440 --> 21:09.480
How many times have I said Shen'er?

21:10.640 --> 21:12.800
He can't change his lewd habits

21:13.800 --> 21:14.800
This time...

21:15.520 --> 21:18.040
This time at your house

21:18.120 --> 21:19.560
Something big happened

21:20.480 --> 21:22.360
I really think I need to hit him.

21:24.080 --> 21:25.480
My mom thinks so too...

21:25.560 --> 21:27.360
Was it your fault this time?

21:31.320 --> 21:32.320
Qian Er

21:33.280 --> 21:34.280
Brother‥

21:35.960 --> 21:37.760
Your brother is a bit lewd.

21:38.680 --> 21:39.680
But this time...

21:40.520 --> 21:42.720
Isn't it his fault that he drank too much?

21:42.800 --> 21:43.800
our hua family

21:44.360 --> 21:46.360
But he is an only son

21:46.800 --> 21:48.320
He's your only brother too

21:49.280 --> 21:50.760
You're just mad at your mom.

21:51.280 --> 21:52.760
You can't ignore me too

21:53.720 --> 21:54.720
children

21:55.520 --> 21:57.280
How can you be angry?

21:57.360 --> 21:58.360
just a feeling

21:58.880 --> 22:00.240
It's not my sister's fault this time

22:01.760 --> 22:02.760
right?

22:19.360 --> 22:21.280
Slave saw big wife

22:21.360 --> 22:22.800
You're mine, there's no need for courtesy

22:24.360 --> 22:27.000
I called here to ask a few questions.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.880
Yesterday I asked you to find my sister

22:28.960 --> 22:30.520
Is there anything unusual about that person?

22:31.720 --> 22:34.280
When the slave went into the backyard to look for Fahrenheit,

22:34.360 --> 22:36.360
He sits alone in the pavilion

22:36.440 --> 22:38.760
People around me said they were looking for hangover soup.

22:39.360 --> 22:41.200
What did he say after you finished preaching?

22:41.800 --> 22:44.600
Mr. Fah said he drank too much wine today.

22:44.680 --> 22:46.240
I want to stay in the pavilion forever

22:46.720 --> 22:48.720
He even asked his slave to inform Madam Hua.

22:49.200 --> 22:51.360
He said he would look for him in the pavilion after the event.

22:52.880 --> 22:54.280
Then did you tell anyone?

22:54.360 --> 22:55.640
Is Huashen in the backyard pavilion?

22:55.720 --> 22:56.720
no

23:02.120 --> 23:03.320
Then on the way back

23:03.400 --> 23:04.720
Have you met anyone else?

23:04.800 --> 23:05.800
nor

23:13.320 --> 23:14.720
oldest woman

23:14.800 --> 23:17.280
Did the slave do something wrong?

23:23.360 --> 23:24.360
It has nothing to do with you.

23:24.440 --> 23:26.920
Don't think too much, go back and rest first.

23:41.400 --> 23:43.520
Madam, what happened to Cui Zhou?

23:45.520 --> 23:47.360
It's okay, just ask

23:47.440 --> 23:49.040
Just take it easy.

23:52.040 --> 23:53.680
Which yard is Mu Yao in now?

23:53.760 --> 23:55.120
It's still my old residence.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.280
I just got refurbished

23:58.480 --> 23:59.480
good

24:09.080 --> 24:10.080
oldest woman

24:11.240 --> 24:12.840
The day before yesterday, my uncle was angry.

24:12.920 --> 24:14.480
It's neither easy nor heavy.

24:14.560 --> 24:16.000
Injuries should also not be minor.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.440
There is no need to stay here any longer.

24:17.520 --> 24:18.520
First, let's go home and rest.

24:19.320 --> 24:20.400
my men are fine

24:33.960 --> 24:35.160
What are you doing?

24:36.880 --> 24:37.960
oldest woman

24:38.040 --> 24:40.800
It was my uncle who asked me to look at Mu Xiaoniang’s yard.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.440
They said they shouldn't let anyone in without permission.

24:43.040 --> 24:44.040
you‥

24:45.800 --> 24:47.080
Go tell Mu Yao

24:47.160 --> 24:48.880
she would be willing to see me

25:05.400 --> 25:06.880
Madam, please

25:34.520 --> 25:35.920
You're guarding me outside.

25:38.320 --> 25:39.320
yes

26:04.480 --> 26:05.960
Have you been waiting for me for a long time?

26:09.040 --> 26:11.280
When you come to defend Hua Shen

26:11.360 --> 26:13.480
Should we lower our stance?

26:13.560 --> 26:15.320
my brother didn't do anything wrong

26:15.400 --> 26:16.760
Why should I advocate for him?

26:18.880 --> 26:21.120
It's just the two of us here now

26:21.200 --> 26:22.560
Then I will speak openly and directly.

26:23.440 --> 26:24.520
I thought about it

26:24.600 --> 26:26.680
Have you ever experienced being trapped?

26:26.760 --> 26:30.360
So I won't use this method in the future.

26:30.440 --> 26:32.120
Now I guess I was wrong

26:32.840 --> 26:34.680
I'm so disappointed in you.

26:36.280 --> 26:38.400
Originally, I didn’t want to come today.

26:38.480 --> 26:40.400
But you put so much effort into designing it.

26:40.480 --> 26:42.560
I would be happy to cooperate with you

26:42.640 --> 26:45.080
Don't let all your efforts go in vain

26:46.600 --> 26:48.280
I said it once

26:48.360 --> 26:50.480
I won't argue with you anymore

26:50.960 --> 26:52.640
But you still don't believe it

26:53.160 --> 26:54.160
at last

26:54.240 --> 26:56.560
Why do we have to use these vulgar methods?

26:56.640 --> 26:58.040
Use Jong Yeran for me.

27:00.520 --> 27:04.360
Do you think I'm doing it for him?

27:04.440 --> 27:05.920
If not, what else is it for?

27:12.200 --> 27:13.600
Since taking steps to design Huashen

27:14.120 --> 27:16.000
Then I won't turn a blind eye to it.

27:16.080 --> 27:18.120
Every injustice has its owner, and every debt has its owner.

27:18.200 --> 27:19.200
Even before

27:19.280 --> 27:22.000
I tolerate you everywhere because I feel guilty about you

27:22.080 --> 27:24.280
But now you use the means

27:24.360 --> 27:26.240
Involve innocent people around me

27:26.720 --> 27:28.040
I won't show you any more mercy

27:33.080 --> 27:35.200
Every injustice has its owner, and every debt has its owner.

27:37.240 --> 27:38.320
Huaqian

27:39.360 --> 27:42.280
How did you have the courage to say this to me?

27:45.920 --> 27:47.240
Why can't I?

27:58.800 --> 28:00.040
uncle

28:00.120 --> 28:01.720
Magistrate Wang Xuan sent more people here.

28:01.800 --> 28:03.240
It's about the Huashen incident.

28:03.320 --> 28:04.680
I also want to ask Mu Xiaoniang something.

28:05.040 --> 28:06.880
Should I make them wait this time?

28:26.360 --> 28:27.400
wait

28:28.120 --> 28:29.440
yes

28:29.520 --> 28:30.520
etc.

28:33.760 --> 28:34.840
I'll ask first

28:37.720 --> 28:39.720
Fahrenheit people

28:39.800 --> 28:43.160
After all, they are all selfish and cannot distinguish between right and wrong.

28:43.840 --> 28:45.680
You said Huashen was right.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.480
Weren't you the one who planned the wedding feast?

28:50.560 --> 28:53.000
My younger brother is a promiscuous man

28:53.080 --> 28:55.480
But I don't have any bad intentions towards you

28:56.960 --> 28:58.080
huh?

28:58.160 --> 28:59.480
i don't know anything else

28:59.560 --> 29:02.440
But my brother won't lie to me

29:02.520 --> 29:04.480
Because I warned him many times

29:04.560 --> 29:07.000
He will never go against my will

29:07.080 --> 29:09.080
Not to mention the past...

29:12.280 --> 29:15.600
Besides, I've known you before

29:15.680 --> 29:16.680
you are not that kind

29:16.760 --> 29:19.400
A person who sheds tears when something happens

29:20.040 --> 29:22.680
That day, you pretended to be scared and hid in a corner.

29:23.600 --> 29:25.440
You're actually acting, right?

29:25.520 --> 29:28.080
The purpose is obvious

29:30.040 --> 29:31.040
yes

29:32.280 --> 29:34.080
What happened that day was what I had planned.

29:34.640 --> 29:37.160
Huashen really didn't have any ill will towards me.

29:41.360 --> 29:44.080
A few days ago, I heard that a female servant had died in that mansion.

29:45.120 --> 29:46.520
However, I met Mr. Fahrenheit at the wedding reception.

29:46.600 --> 29:47.880
Why weren't you hurt at all?

29:48.640 --> 29:51.360
Painters have the protective umbrella of the painter.

29:51.440 --> 29:53.640
The fate of a simple female envoy

29:54.480 --> 29:56.600
Of course I can't take my eyes off it at all

29:59.920 --> 30:01.040
What do you want to say?

30:10.200 --> 30:12.120
The special envoy committed suicide that day.

30:12.920 --> 30:13.920
It's Linglong.

30:22.880 --> 30:25.640
These were all purchased under the director's instructions.

30:25.720 --> 30:27.440
The girl is old enough to discuss marriage.

30:27.520 --> 30:29.440
Now it's time to get dressed.

30:29.520 --> 30:30.720
look at these gems

30:31.320 --> 30:32.320
It's really beautiful

30:34.360 --> 30:35.560
do you like it?

30:35.640 --> 30:36.640
it's up to you

30:37.400 --> 30:38.520
i am a slave

30:38.600 --> 30:40.520
How can you wear such expensive clothes?

30:43.080 --> 30:44.400
Why not?

30:48.680 --> 30:49.680
this

30:56.120 --> 30:57.480
It is recommended not to wear it.

30:57.560 --> 30:58.560
Wear it

30:59.840 --> 31:00.840
wonderful

31:01.480 --> 31:03.440
Didn't I say I was old enough to talk about marriage?

31:04.120 --> 31:06.680
But you are a year older than me

31:06.760 --> 31:08.240
This is my dowry for you

31:09.200 --> 31:10.280
dowry?

31:10.360 --> 31:11.600
you ah you

31:11.680 --> 31:12.800
What nonsense are you talking about?

31:13.800 --> 31:14.800
Do not run

31:19.360 --> 31:21.240
Linglong lost his parents at a young age.

31:21.320 --> 31:23.160
Grew up in the North with me.

31:23.880 --> 31:25.640
You still have to remember her, right?

31:28.080 --> 31:29.480
there are some good ones

31:31.440 --> 31:32.720
Come and try it

31:35.520 --> 31:38.360
You were originally convicted and sold.

31:38.440 --> 31:39.840
I'm just an orphan

31:39.920 --> 31:40.920
no family

31:50.480 --> 31:53.520
At that time, my father was falsely accused and exiled.

31:54.120 --> 31:56.360
All the slaves of our shepherd's family were sold.

31:57.320 --> 31:59.480
Since they are slaves, they are the same no matter where they are sold.

32:00.560 --> 32:02.160
I was originally thinking of doing that too.

32:02.840 --> 32:03.840
but

32:04.800 --> 32:07.400
Why did Huashen buy her?

32:08.960 --> 32:09.960
About you?

32:10.640 --> 32:11.640
About you?

32:11.720 --> 32:14.280
- I will beat you to death ‥ -
Hwahyeong ‥

32:14.360 --> 32:15.560
Don't fight...

32:15.640 --> 32:17.360
This looks so painful.

32:18.480 --> 32:20.680
ungrateful

32:20.760 --> 32:22.600
my friend likes you

32:22.680 --> 32:24.760
That's your blessing, you know?

32:24.840 --> 32:26.160
If you don't want to do it, forget it.

32:26.240 --> 32:29.200
Still hitting my rhubarb

32:30.000 --> 32:31.360
Who gave you courage?

32:31.440 --> 32:32.440
I know I was wrong too

32:33.040 --> 32:34.600
Darangjun, calm down.

32:34.680 --> 32:35.680
concubine?

32:36.360 --> 32:37.360
concubine?

32:38.640 --> 32:39.760
What kind of concubine are you?

32:40.520 --> 32:42.160
You're just a cheap maid

32:42.240 --> 32:45.560
You are the lowly slave I bought you.

32:45.640 --> 32:47.360
Still feeling bad?

32:47.760 --> 32:49.160
Hwahyeong…

32:49.240 --> 32:51.320
As an adult, I don't remember the villain's mistakes.

32:51.400 --> 32:52.400
please save me

32:53.520 --> 32:57.520
You should immediately pack your bags and go back with Brother Wang.

32:57.600 --> 32:58.600
Did you hear that?

32:59.040 --> 33:00.120
Oro-gun

33:00.720 --> 33:01.720
Oro-gun

33:02.640 --> 33:04.040
What does it mean?

33:04.800 --> 33:06.080
What he means is

33:06.520 --> 33:08.040
you are already mine

33:09.080 --> 33:10.080
that

33:10.160 --> 33:11.440
Oro-gun

33:11.520 --> 33:13.200
One woman doesn't care about two husbands

33:13.760 --> 33:15.680
How could you give up on me?

33:16.640 --> 33:17.880
Did I give you a face?

33:18.720 --> 33:20.240
You're just a cheap maid

33:20.320 --> 33:22.160
I will give it to anyone who says I will give it to you.

33:24.440 --> 33:25.760
Beauty, rest assured

33:25.840 --> 33:27.600
Our house is not worse than Brother Hua's house

33:28.200 --> 33:29.280
i will love you well

33:30.000 --> 33:31.160
It's okay if you don't want to go.

33:31.240 --> 33:32.680
I'm telling you, you won't go

33:32.760 --> 33:34.560
Tomorrow I will sell you to a whorehouse.

33:34.640 --> 33:35.640
Check if you are listening or not

33:37.200 --> 33:38.200
walk

33:39.080 --> 33:40.520
Even though I am a slave

33:41.440 --> 33:43.440
I can't stand such humiliation

33:48.720 --> 33:50.200
Little daughter...

33:57.160 --> 33:58.160
little daughter

34:01.280 --> 34:02.280
little daughter

34:08.360 --> 34:09.360
so

34:10.080 --> 34:11.080
Huaqian

34:11.800 --> 34:12.920
Where did you get your confidence?

34:13.000 --> 34:15.440
Do you dare to say that Hua Shen is innocent in front of me?

34:17.040 --> 34:20.680
That lowly maid who died in your mansion

34:20.760 --> 34:23.360
Someone who is like a sister to me

34:24.960 --> 34:26.240
-Me...
-What's wrong?

34:27.160 --> 34:28.600
What else do you want to say?

34:29.240 --> 34:30.240
Huaqian

34:31.160 --> 34:33.600
I gave you time, I gave you a chance

34:33.680 --> 34:35.080
But what did you do?

34:36.200 --> 34:37.440
you should know

34:37.920 --> 34:40.040
Linglong and I have different feelings.

34:40.720 --> 34:41.880
So you thought

34:42.560 --> 34:45.880
Is asking a woman to
compensate for me considered compensation?

34:46.520 --> 34:49.200
No, I didn't know that the envoy was Linglong.

34:49.280 --> 34:50.600
The reason for asking the big princess...

34:50.680 --> 34:53.680
Do you think she's just an ordinary female envoy?

34:55.080 --> 34:58.520
Then you
can do nothing and leave the incarnation to the Father.

34:59.160 --> 35:01.480
I clearly know that Hua Duguan will definitely prefer him.

35:01.560 --> 35:03.280
And you still did it?

35:03.360 --> 35:05.200
'Cause you only feel it in your heart

35:05.800 --> 35:07.400
The fate of a simple female envoy

35:08.040 --> 35:11.720
A person like this is worthless in your eyes.

35:14.520 --> 35:16.880
You told me once that you would never target me again.

35:18.520 --> 35:20.480
I almost believed you

35:20.960 --> 35:23.680
I would like to believe that perhaps you too may be involved in the work of our shepherd family.

35:23.760 --> 35:24.760
without any knowledge

35:27.320 --> 35:29.320
But what happened to Linglong made me understand.

35:30.840 --> 35:34.520
I have absolutely no choice to forgive you

35:35.440 --> 35:37.680
Because of what your Hua family did.

35:37.760 --> 35:39.280
People suffering in secret

35:39.360 --> 35:40.680
In addition, there are countless

35:41.480 --> 35:44.160
And after all, you are also from the Hua family.

35:44.720 --> 35:47.480
In the end, he is still as cold and selfish as ever.

35:47.960 --> 35:50.080
Since you can't see it, you can pretend not to know

35:50.160 --> 35:51.160
but i

35:51.800 --> 35:52.800
no

35:55.480 --> 35:56.480
so

35:57.960 --> 36:00.280
This is the original intention in designing Huashen.

36:01.920 --> 36:03.320
Revenge on Linglong

36:06.160 --> 36:08.000
You don't have to deal with that person.

36:08.520 --> 36:10.720
Then I'll make sure he gets what he deserves.

36:11.600 --> 36:14.440
You do not take the life of a female envoy seriously.

36:15.360 --> 36:17.960
Then, the identity of me as Jong Ye-ran’s concubine?

36:19.520 --> 36:22.160
Do you think you can make Hua Shen shed a layer of skin?

36:25.560 --> 36:27.320
This way too

36:28.560 --> 36:30.120
Take advantage of people who love you

36:36.360 --> 36:37.760
What happened using this method?

36:38.960 --> 36:42.280
Are you the only person in the world allowed to bully others?

36:42.360 --> 36:44.000
Aren't other people allowed to resist?

36:45.600 --> 36:46.600
for me

36:48.080 --> 36:49.800
As far as dealing with the Hua family

36:50.600 --> 36:54.160
It's clean no matter which method you use.

37:00.080 --> 37:01.080
good

37:02.160 --> 37:03.160
all right

37:15.400 --> 37:16.400
oldest woman

37:18.720 --> 37:20.440
Madam, what's going on?

37:20.520 --> 37:21.520
Yes or no‥

37:26.600 --> 37:27.800
What are you doing here?

37:31.080 --> 37:32.400
From now on, without my permission

37:32.480 --> 37:33.960
You cannot enter Ayao's yard.

37:38.760 --> 37:41.040
The best of the day...

37:41.120 --> 37:42.760
If there are no obstacles

37:43.160 --> 37:46.160
Will your sword fall on my head?

37:53.800 --> 37:55.560
The answer is a resounding yes

37:59.600 --> 38:00.600
Nakaya Ake

38:02.160 --> 38:04.960
Is that jade pendant that important?

38:06.400 --> 38:09.560
When I was young I went to the temple with you, and
who was the one who kept vigil?

38:10.160 --> 38:11.480
Is it really that important?

38:13.560 --> 38:15.000
you like someone

38:15.520 --> 38:17.360
Is it based on the jade pendant and memories?

38:18.600 --> 38:20.600
What are you telling me now?

38:24.920 --> 38:26.520
I want to ask ‥

38:27.600 --> 38:29.960
Is that person a scammer?

38:30.720 --> 38:32.840
Will everything I do from now on be wrong?

38:33.480 --> 38:34.480
this life

38:35.160 --> 38:37.920
There is no opportunity to edit or modify it.

38:40.440 --> 38:42.560
Even if I lose my life

38:44.600 --> 38:47.000
You can't even draw a sword on me

38:47.520 --> 38:49.880
Want to buy yourself some time to defend yourself?

38:51.320 --> 38:53.480
You're showing weakness in front of me now

38:54.480 --> 38:57.560
Just to soften my mood and let Hua Shen go, right?

39:08.320 --> 39:09.720
my uncle said so

39:11.120 --> 39:12.520
That's it

39:54.080 --> 39:55.080
oldest woman

40:13.360 --> 40:15.120
It turned out to be Qian Zhi.

40:38.640 --> 40:41.880
How do you plan to deal with the Huashen issue?

40:48.080 --> 40:49.840
It all depends on your uncle.

40:58.840 --> 40:59.840
uncle

41:02.320 --> 41:04.320
Magistrate Wang Xuan's uncle's people have not left yet.

41:04.400 --> 41:06.080
How should I answer this time?

41:17.360 --> 41:18.840
It is recommended to press first

41:19.920 --> 41:20.920
yes

41:54.760 --> 41:57.320
I think you have suffered serious internal injuries.

41:57.960 --> 41:59.640
But why do you only want Mount Jindaosan?

42:00.000 --> 42:01.880
How about giving a diagnosis?

42:01.960 --> 42:03.640
There is no need as long as the golden sword flies

42:04.520 --> 42:07.520
- Please help me quickly.
- Looks like it's in good condition here.

42:07.600 --> 42:09.200
No wounds

42:09.280 --> 42:12.200
Why do you want Jin Daosan to heal your trauma?

42:12.280 --> 42:13.560
Did you find that?

42:13.640 --> 42:14.640
I'm looking for you‥

42:17.840 --> 42:19.440
I found it... Where is the wound?

42:19.520 --> 42:21.000
Come on, let me bandage you.

42:21.520 --> 42:23.320
Why are you so anxious?

42:23.400 --> 42:24.880
Doctor, do you have any golden sword powder?

42:25.720 --> 42:27.120
What happened at home today?

42:27.200 --> 42:28.440
Who is injured?

42:28.920 --> 42:30.760
Why is everyone asking for Jindaosan?

42:31.600 --> 42:33.120
hurry up, please. I need it urgently.

42:35.120 --> 42:36.120
continued

42:36.200 --> 42:37.200
Thanks for watching
