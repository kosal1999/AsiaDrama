<i>Episode 4</i>

01:38.640 --> 01:39.680
ma'am.

01:39.760 --> 01:42.360
My aunt and uncle had a fight in the tea shop.

01:42.440 --> 01:43.480
How about this time?

01:43.560 --> 01:44.760
Someone from my family came...

01:44.840 --> 01:46.120
And they said they were fighting...

01:46.200 --> 01:48.360
At a tea shop because of a woman.

01:48.440 --> 01:50.480
He told me to go and see it.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.400
Are you a girl again?

01:52.880 --> 01:55.360
Why did they come to see me?

01:55.440 --> 01:56.440
Where is my father?

01:56.520 --> 01:58.880
Your parents went to visit your grandparents.

01:58.960 --> 02:00.360
They can't go home.

02:00.440 --> 02:02.400
So the assistant came to see the lady.

02:03.560 --> 02:04.640
so.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.040
He must be out of control.

02:10.440 --> 02:12.200
You will die later.
Let me tell you.

02:12.280 --> 02:13.840
You will all die here.

02:14.120 --> 02:16.880
Sir, my father has been sick for a long time.

02:16.960 --> 02:19.520
He depends on the money I get here.

02:19.600 --> 02:22.120
I can't keep up with you.
I appeal.

02:22.200 --> 02:23.440
Let me go.

02:23.520 --> 02:26.120
I said.
I'll take care of him...

02:26.200 --> 02:28.120
As long as you come back with me.

02:28.200 --> 02:29.480
Is there anything else you want?

02:30.120 --> 02:31.280
He tried to hide.

02:31.360 --> 02:32.400
Does he want that...

02:32.760 --> 02:34.640
Did he say he doesn't like you?

02:36.600 --> 02:38.680
good.
you make me angry

02:38.760 --> 02:39.840
Just wait and see.

02:40.240 --> 02:41.640
Brother, isn’t this enough?

02:42.640 --> 02:44.640
Dear sister, Qian.

02:45.080 --> 02:46.680
Good luck.

02:46.760 --> 02:47.840
Are you here to help my brother?

02:47.920 --> 02:49.360
Those people are so ignorant...

02:49.440 --> 02:52.360
So how dare you hit my brother.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.000
Mr. Qian, how many people
are you here with?

02:54.080 --> 02:55.400
Do by that way!

02:56.360 --> 02:58.400
Why do you think I came to help you?

03:00.920 --> 03:03.400
How dare
you ask your family for help...

03:03.880 --> 03:06.360
While you're a thug?

03:06.440 --> 03:09.120
Do you think this city belongs to your family?

03:09.200 --> 03:10.200
you...

03:10.280 --> 03:13.720
You exaggerated the story.

03:14.080 --> 03:15.440
What makes you think...

03:15.520 --> 03:16.720
I came to help him?

03:17.440 --> 03:21.400
We all
heard him call you sister.

03:21.760 --> 03:23.040
Mr. Zhong is a wise man.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.720
But he ruined his reputation...

03:25.200 --> 03:27.400
Because he can no longer control his family.

03:27.680 --> 03:29.720
Of course there are misunderstandings.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.040
no way.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.400
I'm just saying what I think.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.480
Unfortunately
Mr. Wise Zong...

03:37.840 --> 03:39.520
Exchange fish eyes for pearls...

03:40.000 --> 03:42.400
And gets trapped by a woman.

03:44.200 --> 03:45.640
You me...

03:49.680 --> 03:51.200
<i>I've never seen it</i>

03:51.280 --> 03:53.800
<i>They</i> <i>Look like people passing by...</i>

03:54.080 --> 03:55.800
<i>But they seem to know...</i>

03:55.880 --> 03:57.720
<i>How I Married</i>
<i>With Jong Ye-ran</i>

03:58.520 --> 04:00.200
<i>Who is my brother looking for a knight with?</i>

04:02.040 --> 04:03.800
- Police, be careful.
- Who is that person?

04:03.880 --> 04:04.880
that...

04:09.000 --> 04:10.160
who are you?

04:10.240 --> 04:11.640
Have you lost your mind?

04:12.080 --> 04:13.480
There are a lot of guards here.

04:13.560 --> 04:14.560
I don't understand why they are needed...

04:14.640 --> 04:16.640
Servants helping them.

04:16.960 --> 04:18.760
Guard, tie him up!

04:18.840 --> 04:19.840
Who are you that binds me?

04:19.920 --> 04:21.800
You slander the Zhong family.

04:22.120 --> 04:23.120
Where are you!

04:23.440 --> 04:25.440
Tie him up too.

04:25.520 --> 04:26.840
Take it to court.

04:32.560 --> 04:34.760
Chief, did you make a mistake?

04:34.840 --> 04:36.120
I showed it to my brother.

04:36.200 --> 04:37.800
I was locked up in jail for a few days...

04:38.080 --> 04:40.120
It will help me correct my sister's mistake.

04:40.440 --> 04:41.440
sibling...

04:41.560 --> 04:42.560
How about you?

04:42.920 --> 04:44.120
I'm not a judge...

04:44.200 --> 04:45.440
So I cannot judge this case.

04:45.760 --> 04:48.480
But you keep making me angry.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.640
I also have an impatient personality.

04:51.080 --> 04:52.200
so...

04:52.280 --> 04:53.360
Please explain to the judge...

04:53.440 --> 04:54.560
together.

04:55.080 --> 04:56.080
Kian.

05:01.760 --> 05:02.840
What is your name?

05:03.600 --> 05:04.640
Longzhou...

05:05.600 --> 05:06.640
Longzhou...

05:07.640 --> 05:08.640
Jooyong, Bukan?

05:09.280 --> 05:11.320
Thank you for your kindness.

05:12.200 --> 05:13.640
you look young

05:13.920 --> 05:15.880
Don't forget to protect yourself
...

05:15.960 --> 05:18.720
Before helping others.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.840
Nothing is more important...

05:20.920 --> 05:22.320
From yourself.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.280
The Zhong family
will pay for your treatment.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.320
It doesn't matter if you just follow the situation...

05:28.400 --> 05:30.600
Or leave a comment...

05:31.080 --> 05:32.920
I know you did it to protect me
...

05:33.000 --> 05:34.720
Thank you for your kindness.

05:35.080 --> 05:36.360
But you need to know...

05:36.440 --> 05:37.480
Not everyone...

05:37.960 --> 05:39.880
I will do what I did for you

05:39.960 --> 05:41.880
Kian.
My brother was wrong.

05:41.960 --> 05:43.160
I will never do that again.

05:43.240 --> 05:45.000
I don't want to go to court.

05:45.080 --> 05:46.080
- Let go.
- no. I don't want it.

05:46.160 --> 05:47.720
Wait a minute, ma'am.

05:48.760 --> 05:50.440
I apologize on behalf of my brother...

05:50.840 --> 05:52.120
Because I made you angry.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.360
He is loud and clear...

05:55.440 --> 05:56.840
So he is easily fooled.

05:56.960 --> 05:59.160
Don't let him influence you.

06:01.960 --> 06:03.280
Don't apologize to me.

06:03.360 --> 06:04.760
I don't want to interfere.

06:04.840 --> 06:06.760
Just explain it to the judge.

06:06.840 --> 06:07.920
That's it.

06:08.080 --> 06:10.720
We both apologize...

06:11.200 --> 06:13.520
And forget this.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.280
This is just a fight.

06:15.640 --> 06:17.280
We recommend not taking it to court.

06:18.680 --> 06:19.680
That's exactly right.

06:19.760 --> 06:22.400
I think he has a point.

06:26.440 --> 06:27.880
You can just leave it alone.

06:28.520 --> 06:33.120
But it's not your choice.

06:33.520 --> 06:36.560
It depends on who is involved.

06:39.120 --> 06:41.840
If Mr. Whoa, stop
bothering me...

06:42.320 --> 06:44.200
I will forget it.

06:44.840 --> 06:45.960
I won't put pressure on you.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.600
Absolutely not.
Go, hurry.

06:49.080 --> 06:50.640
Send my brother back...

06:50.920 --> 06:53.000
And lock him up...

06:53.080 --> 06:56.480
Before my parents return.

06:56.840 --> 06:58.640
- Okay, ma'am.
- Police, you...

06:59.520 --> 07:00.720
Teacher, please.

07:08.200 --> 07:09.200
go away.

07:21.320 --> 07:24.120
<i>Who are they?</i>

07:25.920 --> 07:26.920
Chenz!

07:27.920 --> 07:29.880
Send someone to the tail to check...

07:29.960 --> 07:32.320
Madam, I was really impressed.

07:35.640 --> 07:36.720
Tuan.

07:37.080 --> 07:38.080
I watched you from above.

07:38.160 --> 07:40.160
You are different...

07:40.240 --> 07:42.040
Because it is very strict.

07:44.280 --> 07:45.440
You are so kind.

07:45.520 --> 07:48.520
Women change after they get married.

07:51.080 --> 07:52.840
Why didn’t our senior come with us?

07:53.200 --> 07:55.160
It's my family's thing.

07:55.240 --> 07:57.280
It would be better for that person not to come.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.080
so.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.120
I've been out for a long time.

08:02.200 --> 08:03.360
It's time to come back.

08:03.440 --> 08:05.640
Can you send me back?

08:07.440 --> 08:08.440
what?

08:08.520 --> 08:10.080
My carriage is too small for two people.

08:16.200 --> 08:18.400
If you don't like this cart
...

08:19.080 --> 08:20.240
please.

08:50.560 --> 08:52.080
Did you go out alone today?

08:54.960 --> 08:56.080
afoot?

08:59.440 --> 09:00.880
<i>Don't panic.</i>

09:14.120 --> 09:16.760
Go ahead and try it. Didn't you say a word?</i>

09:16.840 --> 09:18.120
<i>Is it Felic?</i>

09:18.840 --> 09:21.120
<i>I am his sister-in-law.</i>

09:21.200 --> 09:23.960
<i> Wouldn't it be rude to share my carriage</i> <i>?</i>

09:24.440 --> 09:25.800
<i>What does he want?</i>

09:54.200 --> 09:55.200
Sister-in-law.

09:56.760 --> 09:57.760
Sister-in-law.

09:59.960 --> 10:01.080
Please forgive.

10:01.320 --> 10:02.760
for what reason?

10:03.440 --> 10:04.520
Arrived at Jong Park.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.160
Thank you for sending it
, daughter-in-law.

10:34.560 --> 10:37.800
He would later fall in love with Mu Yao.

10:37.880 --> 10:40.760
What am I thinking?

10:47.920 --> 10:48.920
let's go.

10:57.200 --> 11:00.720
Have you seen those two men?

11:01.640 --> 11:02.800
no.

11:02.880 --> 11:05.400
They may be people passing through the city.

11:05.880 --> 11:09.040
It doesn't seem that way.

11:10.080 --> 11:12.560
Should we arrest them?

11:15.240 --> 11:16.480
for what reason?

11:16.760 --> 11:18.760
They didn't do anything wrong today.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.120
<i>Why are there so many</i>
<i>People and things...</i>

11:23.200 --> 11:24.720
<i>Never seen this before?</i>

11:25.520 --> 11:27.240
<i>Has my life changed...</i>

11:27.320 --> 11:29.040
<i>With a new choice?</i>

11:30.080 --> 11:33.080
<i>But the important thing</i>
<i>may not change</i>

11:37.520 --> 11:39.400
Want more food?

11:39.880 --> 11:40.880
Assistant Lee...

11:40.960 --> 11:44.280
When do you worship ancestors
?

11:45.840 --> 11:47.400
Two months left.

11:49.120 --> 11:51.320
Do you need anything?

11:52.680 --> 11:53.840
<i>Muzula...</i>

11:54.760 --> 11:56.560
<i>It's not too late...</i>

11:56.640 --> 11:58.160
<i>So you can make plans</i>

12:01.320 --> 12:02.880
Madam, Mr. Zhong has arrived.

12:09.200 --> 12:10.200
Tuan.

12:10.280 --> 12:13.640
I told them not to be too formal.

12:15.680 --> 12:16.840
Queen directly told me...

12:16.920 --> 12:18.280
So as not to break the rules.

12:21.440 --> 12:23.880
I just got back and
I haven't had dinner yet.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.520
On time.

13:24.560 --> 13:25.880
Why do you eat so little?

13:26.520 --> 13:27.920
I ate ...

13:28.000 --> 13:29.640
before you come

13:35.760 --> 13:39.040
Have I been ignoring you lately
?

13:41.000 --> 13:42.560
Why don't you see me?

13:42.640 --> 13:43.840
About your brother's problem today?

13:45.520 --> 13:46.520
You have to face...

13:46.600 --> 13:48.480
Lots of things to do every day.

13:48.840 --> 13:50.480
I don't want to bother you...

13:50.560 --> 13:51.880
As long as I can manage it.

13:53.080 --> 13:54.560
We are husband and wife.

13:54.840 --> 13:56.640
Why are you treating me like a stranger now ?

13:57.440 --> 13:59.040
The problem is that he is so stupid...

13:59.120 --> 14:01.000
So that you can take care of yourself.

14:01.080 --> 14:04.520
Or else people
will think we are bullies.

14:05.360 --> 14:07.480
He listens to me.

14:07.560 --> 14:09.080
So I can take care of myself.

14:10.840 --> 14:11.920
Kian.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.720
It looks cold...

14:16.280 --> 14:18.440
Since we got married.

14:22.960 --> 14:24.200
You're overthinking it.

14:28.240 --> 14:29.720
Now we're married...

14:30.440 --> 14:31.840
I must do my duty
.

14:32.560 --> 14:33.840
It's my fault...

14:34.600 --> 14:37.040
It's because I've been ignoring you since we got married.

14:37.600 --> 14:38.840
I will treat you
better.

15:03.640 --> 15:04.960
What about Muyao?

15:05.920 --> 15:08.560
How do you want to treat that person?

15:17.520 --> 15:18.720
I will take responsibility...

15:19.520 --> 15:20.720
Because I married you.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.760
I didn't even ask.

15:24.840 --> 15:28.240
What did you think at first...

15:28.360 --> 15:29.760
Rather than making hasty decisions
?

15:29.840 --> 15:32.800
Or maybe it's not fair to all of us.

15:33.560 --> 15:35.640
- Security...
- It's late.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.640
it's a good night.

15:58.920 --> 16:01.360
Tuan Zhong wants to spend the night here.

16:01.440 --> 16:03.840
Why did you kick him out?

16:03.920 --> 16:05.600
You know it too.

16:05.680 --> 16:08.040
He thinks about other people.

16:08.320 --> 16:11.360
The lady got married...

16:11.440 --> 16:12.920
With him.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.600
You can't make him think about you
...

16:15.680 --> 16:18.000
every time.

16:18.080 --> 16:21.200
Being a wife and
being a girl are different.

16:21.280 --> 16:24.000
You need to think carefully about the pros and cons...

16:24.080 --> 16:26.280
Not your wife's feelings

16:26.360 --> 16:27.960
I know what you're trying to say.

16:28.240 --> 16:30.480
But I don't want to...

16:31.600 --> 16:33.080
<i>Make the same mistake</i>

16:49.200 --> 16:51.560
You are getting better at being a housekeeper.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.800
Thank you for accepting me, sir.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.560
How long do you want to stay here?

16:56.520 --> 16:58.560
Don't tell me you like being a maid.

16:59.520 --> 17:02.320
Until I met the man who imprisoned my family.

17:04.440 --> 17:05.600
You are insisting on staying here...

17:05.680 --> 17:07.840
Just to investigate your family's case?

17:12.960 --> 17:14.120
Qian doesn't want to get involved...

17:14.200 --> 17:15.600
In dispute.

17:15.680 --> 17:17.720
you are a good friend

17:18.840 --> 17:21.080
Why can't I let him go?

17:21.440 --> 17:23.200
Did I say Hua Qian?

17:23.280 --> 17:24.480
Who imprisoned my father?

17:28.440 --> 17:30.800
You know better than anyone else...

17:30.880 --> 17:33.400
And just fool yourself.

17:35.640 --> 17:36.960
I'm
not going to argue with you.

17:38.200 --> 17:41.040
Qian is my wife.

17:41.520 --> 17:42.880
He is innocent.

17:44.320 --> 17:46.040
Still,
if you want to fight that person...

17:46.440 --> 17:48.200
I can't let you stay here any longer
.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.400
I took a risk...

17:57.640 --> 17:59.160
And welcome...

17:59.240 --> 18:00.640
Because of the past.

18:02.320 --> 18:03.320
You can say anything now ...

18:03.400 --> 18:05.280
To others when you leave.

18:05.760 --> 18:08.280
I was scammed...

18:09.760 --> 18:11.840
With her innocence.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.760
Now I understand his true nature...

18:13.840 --> 18:15.520
But sir, no.

18:16.680 --> 18:17.840
For me...

18:18.520 --> 18:21.160
Hua Qian was as cruel as a snake.

18:22.080 --> 18:23.320
- You...
- Three months.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.160
If you can't prove it...

18:26.240 --> 18:27.920
My father
was locked up for 3 months...

18:28.000 --> 18:29.560
I will leave Hwangcheong...

18:29.640 --> 18:31.120
And it won't come back.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.720
I won't ruin it...

18:33.520 --> 18:35.480
The teacher or that person.

18:36.280 --> 18:38.280
If you trust that person...

18:38.560 --> 18:40.960
Why are you worried about my investigation?

18:41.520 --> 18:42.960
I want to know too...

18:43.560 --> 18:45.520
I wonder if that person is trapping me...

18:46.320 --> 18:47.840
Or maybe I misunderstood.

18:48.520 --> 18:49.960
I investigated.

18:50.840 --> 18:51.960
No one in his family...

18:52.280 --> 18:54.040
I'm involved in your case.

18:54.520 --> 18:56.360
The person who filed the case
has nothing to do with it...

18:56.440 --> 18:58.160
With him and his family.

18:58.240 --> 19:01.000
Of course, you don't know what he's talking about
...

19:01.080 --> 19:02.240
Between me and that person.

19:02.560 --> 19:07.280
Even if I tell you , you won't believe me .

19:12.440 --> 19:14.760
I can't let him near me
...

19:14.840 --> 19:16.640
With this heart.

19:17.200 --> 19:18.200
I swear...

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
I just want to reveal it...

19:20.080 --> 19:21.480
The truth about our family's case.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.760
I don't want to lock him up.

19:23.840 --> 19:26.440
If that person has nothing to do with this incident...

19:26.520 --> 19:27.720
I won't hurt him.

19:28.520 --> 19:30.120
If you break your promise...

19:30.200 --> 19:33.640
I will die and rot in hell.

19:43.560 --> 19:44.600
great.

19:45.240 --> 19:46.760
We give you 3 months.

20:09.240 --> 20:10.600
The scent of this Qianhua perfume is...

20:10.680 --> 20:12.720
It's different this time.

20:13.240 --> 20:14.680
It's freshly made...

20:14.760 --> 20:16.440
Same fresh Melur flowers.

20:16.520 --> 20:17.600
It's quite different from...

20:17.680 --> 20:19.120
What we received.

20:19.200 --> 20:20.680
I will stop using this product now...

20:20.760 --> 20:22.320
If you don't like it.

20:22.440 --> 20:23.960
are you okay.

20:30.240 --> 20:31.640
How long have I been married?

20:32.360 --> 20:33.440
About a month.

20:34.840 --> 20:36.960
Time passes very slowly.

20:38.440 --> 20:39.840
Why is that so?

20:39.920 --> 20:42.880
This month seems to pass quickly.

20:44.440 --> 20:45.720
You won't understand.

20:47.360 --> 20:49.360
When do you worship ancestors?

20:49.440 --> 20:50.920
49 days left.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
This is the 24th time...

20:52.080 --> 20:53.560
The lady asked me.

20:55.200 --> 20:56.440
How slow.

20:56.760 --> 20:58.440
It's really slow.

20:58.520 --> 21:00.360
Why at this time
Madam Madam - Is that so...

21:00.440 --> 21:02.120
Want to attend the awards ceremony?

21:02.200 --> 21:03.680
You always pretend to be sick...

21:03.760 --> 21:05.280
To avoid.

21:05.360 --> 21:06.640
That's different.

21:07.200 --> 21:10.880
This year's event is very important.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.000
This
is their chance to express their love.

21:14.080 --> 21:15.280
But now...

21:15.360 --> 21:16.680
This is your only chance...

21:16.760 --> 21:19.280
Fix errors.

21:20.520 --> 21:22.720
Express your love?
WHO?

21:24.520 --> 21:26.160
Secrets cannot be revealed.

21:31.840 --> 21:34.120
You
are worried about everything...

21:34.200 --> 21:35.800
Except for the really important ones
.

21:35.880 --> 21:38.200
It's been a month since we got married.

21:38.280 --> 21:40.160
But you
always sleep in the reading room.

21:40.240 --> 21:41.840
When this comes out...

21:47.760 --> 21:49.760
Sir, Nanfeng has arrived.

21:50.440 --> 21:51.840
Hello, madam.

21:52.560 --> 21:54.040
What do you want this time?

21:57.920 --> 22:01.160
Madam,
you told me to send it here.

22:01.760 --> 22:02.760
What is he?

22:08.440 --> 22:09.600
<i>구친</i>.

22:25.640 --> 22:26.680
late.

22:26.760 --> 22:28.400
How about sleeping here?

22:28.680 --> 22:30.440
Did you tell me to leave?

22:32.440 --> 22:33.520
I understand.

22:34.200 --> 22:35.440
After all, you're not coming back...

22:35.520 --> 22:36.520
On the wedding night.

22:36.880 --> 22:38.600
You left him alone to visit his family.

22:38.680 --> 22:40.720
Did you just learn how to speak?

22:50.440 --> 22:54.200
Sir, I didn't even ask.

22:54.600 --> 22:56.800
What did you think at first...

22:56.880 --> 22:59.680
Rather than making hasty decisions
?

22:59.760 --> 23:03.040
Or maybe it's not fair to all of us.

23:05.400 --> 23:08.280
Please let me know.
How can I make up for my mistakes with that person?

23:08.640 --> 23:10.080
Finally you realize.

23:10.440 --> 23:11.680
easy.

23:12.240 --> 23:14.000
You are a good girl.

23:14.080 --> 23:16.040
Teacher, can you...

23:16.520 --> 23:18.200
Knowing his hobbies.

23:22.760 --> 23:24.280
His hobby strategy...

23:25.760 --> 23:27.480
This <i>Guqin</i>
was made by the best craftsmen...

23:27.560 --> 23:28.560
Zhang Jing.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.040
It's the only one in the world.

23:30.120 --> 23:33.040
You are famous for your <i>Guqin</i> skills.

23:33.120 --> 23:35.000
I was looking for it to give as a gift to my aunt...

23:35.080 --> 23:36.560
Because you can use it well
.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.400
Thank you to him.

23:42.840 --> 23:45.440
Yinxing, simpan dalam stor.

23:48.520 --> 23:51.040
Don't you want to play?

23:52.120 --> 23:54.280
I'll try it next time.

23:57.120 --> 23:58.160
I go first.

24:08.240 --> 24:09.760
You were originally really excited...

24:09.840 --> 24:11.440
When I saw the great <i>Guchin</i>.

24:11.520 --> 24:12.600
It seems...

24:12.680 --> 24:14.400
The lady is not interested at all.

24:15.440 --> 24:16.840
I noticed...

24:16.920 --> 24:19.080
You don’t like Nanfeng.

24:19.760 --> 24:21.680
Because he always brings bad news.

24:21.760 --> 24:23.040
One wedding night long ago...

24:23.120 --> 24:24.120
And when I come home during the day ...

24:24.200 --> 24:26.280
Qianzhi, that’s nonsense.

24:26.760 --> 24:28.640
I think he's a good person.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.040
ma'am...

24:39.200 --> 24:41.680
This board
is made from premium Torreya wood.

24:41.760 --> 24:42.760
Both pieces and boxes...

24:42.840 --> 24:45.000
Made of natural jade.

24:45.080 --> 24:46.920
I was looking for it to give as a gift to my aunt...

24:47.000 --> 24:48.520
Because you can use it well
.

24:51.760 --> 24:53.600
Madam, you work hard...

24:53.680 --> 24:54.720
Look for this bristle brush.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.920
Your writing is beautiful...

24:57.000 --> 24:58.400
And I will use it well.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.880
This
is the best paper and inkstone in town.

25:03.960 --> 25:06.440
Ma'am, you can use...

25:06.520 --> 25:08.080
draw.

25:14.600 --> 25:15.760
Keep it in store.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.160
Keep it in store.

25:17.240 --> 25:18.280
Keep it in store.

25:19.640 --> 25:21.800
Madam, you treated me well
.

25:21.880 --> 25:23.440
He knows you have a talent for literature...

25:23.520 --> 25:25.160
And prepare for this.

25:26.120 --> 25:27.120
Just save it to storage.

25:40.760 --> 25:43.160
He keeps everything I send?

25:43.840 --> 25:45.360
- yes.
- You didn't even touch it?

25:45.760 --> 25:46.760
of.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.000
He said he would calm down...

25:51.080 --> 25:52.120
If I knew that person's hobbies.

25:53.760 --> 25:56.360
perhaps...

25:56.440 --> 25:58.040
You acted too late.

25:58.440 --> 26:00.800
yes.
Now that I think about it, it's been a month...

26:00.880 --> 26:01.960
After the wedding is over.

26:02.280 --> 26:05.000
Maybe he should meet you...

26:05.080 --> 26:06.520
And not this gift.

26:06.920 --> 26:09.240
Somehow...

26:09.320 --> 26:10.960
I would like your advice.

26:11.920 --> 26:13.520
Did you bring anything?

26:13.600 --> 26:15.280
- not needed.
- Please bring something.

26:15.360 --> 26:16.440
Please bring something, sir.

26:20.520 --> 26:22.120
I remember you liked sweet foods
.

26:22.200 --> 26:23.640
So I brought dessert.

26:25.520 --> 26:27.800
He suffered from toothache before marriage.

26:27.880 --> 26:29.120
The doctor said I shouldn't eat it...

26:29.200 --> 26:30.440
Another dessert.

26:39.240 --> 26:40.800
The teacher is very kind.

26:40.880 --> 26:43.400
Now let's put it on the table.

26:52.080 --> 26:53.440
No problem...

26:53.520 --> 26:54.560
Until I got here?

26:56.440 --> 26:57.640
You don't like...

26:58.840 --> 26:59.880
That gift?

27:01.000 --> 27:02.160
Of course I like it.

27:03.080 --> 27:04.200
So what...

27:12.600 --> 27:15.520
Today's workshop inspection has been cancelled.

27:15.840 --> 27:17.320
Is there a place you want to go?

27:18.520 --> 27:19.520
Work is more important.

27:19.600 --> 27:20.800
You need to take care...

27:20.880 --> 27:22.560
First off, it's official.

27:24.760 --> 27:26.360
You always live in this house.

27:26.440 --> 27:27.480
I'm afraid you might be bored.

27:27.560 --> 27:28.760
no.

27:28.840 --> 27:31.280
I always go out when I have time.

27:31.360 --> 27:33.280
So where are you going today?

27:33.360 --> 27:34.400
I will follow you.

27:36.240 --> 27:37.360
are you okay.

27:37.440 --> 27:38.440
what?

27:39.080 --> 27:40.640
Are there places I can't go?

27:43.160 --> 27:45.280
<i>Taman species</i>

27:50.200 --> 27:52.320
Master, your wife has arrived.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.520
Please forgive me, master.

27:56.080 --> 27:58.240
Why did you visit me?

27:58.320 --> 28:01.200
Did something happen between you and Yellen?

28:01.840 --> 28:03.000
long time no see...

28:03.080 --> 28:05.040
and i miss you so much

28:05.120 --> 28:07.280
So I came to see my master.

28:09.600 --> 28:10.720
sit down.

28:11.280 --> 28:12.280
Yes, master.

28:17.880 --> 28:19.640
Master, the prince has arrived.

28:23.560 --> 28:24.720
Goodbye, mother.

28:25.640 --> 28:27.320
Permit.
Please sit here.

28:29.760 --> 28:32.800
You called the doctor yesterday.

28:32.880 --> 28:35.240
Are you feeling unwell?

28:35.320 --> 28:36.480
naught.

28:36.560 --> 28:39.280
Your child has indigestion.

28:40.880 --> 28:44.200
Take care of your health.

28:44.600 --> 28:45.920
As a teacher...

28:46.000 --> 28:48.280
You should...

28:48.360 --> 28:51.560
Eat dessert in moderation.

28:52.600 --> 28:53.640
N.Gao...

28:54.840 --> 28:55.840
Have you ever worked?

28:55.920 --> 28:58.800
At the palace before you came here with me.

28:59.120 --> 29:00.800
You don't need me...

29:00.880 --> 29:03.480
You're just trying to remind me, right?

29:03.920 --> 29:04.960
Yes, master.

29:05.320 --> 29:07.520
My son understands, mother.

29:14.640 --> 29:15.640
Monarch...

29:15.720 --> 29:16.960
Yaxiang has something to report.

29:19.360 --> 29:21.280
Please forgive me, master.

29:23.080 --> 29:24.520
What is that?

29:26.120 --> 29:27.920
Spices sent by a comprador...

29:28.000 --> 29:29.160
We already broke up.

29:29.240 --> 29:31.440
This is available stock.

29:39.520 --> 29:41.720
I remember reporting it...

29:41.800 --> 29:44.360
This was yesterday.

29:44.440 --> 29:47.080
Why did you come back here with inventory?

29:48.880 --> 29:50.880
furthermore...

29:50.960 --> 29:52.040
Strong winds these past few days...

29:52.120 --> 29:54.120
Damage flowers in your yard.

29:54.200 --> 29:56.840
How about we buy flowers?

29:56.920 --> 29:58.200
Are they of the same species again?

29:58.600 --> 30:01.720
You can ask your assistant about this minor issue
.

30:06.920 --> 30:08.720
If you don't have anything important to do, leave.

30:09.760 --> 30:10.920
Yes, master.

30:12.080 --> 30:13.360
Mom site...

30:13.440 --> 30:16.760
Be energetic every time you come.

30:20.440 --> 30:22.720
Master, Mr. Hwaman has arrived.

30:25.840 --> 30:29.720
These days, I rarely visit my grandmother
.

30:30.600 --> 30:33.480
So mom
sent someone this morning...

30:33.960 --> 30:36.040
I'm going to invite that person...

30:36.120 --> 30:37.560
So that mom can talk to that person
.

30:37.640 --> 30:39.160
Because you are here...

30:39.920 --> 30:41.280
Mom will tell him to go.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.880
He is here. Please let him in.

30:44.240 --> 30:45.680
Let him in.

30:45.760 --> 30:46.760
Yes, master.

30:54.840 --> 30:56.960
Why are you so stubborn?

31:04.280 --> 31:05.440
<i>Nampak?</i>

31:05.520 --> 31:07.440
<i>His father gave him up</i>

31:07.880 --> 31:09.600
<i>Otherwise</i>
<i>He wouldn't act strange...</i>

31:09.680 --> 31:10.960
<i>It looks weak</i>

31:11.440 --> 31:13.400
Please forgive me, master.

31:13.960 --> 31:17.760
Aren't you my aunt's cousin?

31:17.840 --> 31:21.080
However,
the two are rarely seen together.

31:22.240 --> 31:25.280
He lived with his aunt in the city.

31:25.360 --> 31:27.720
We only visit each other during festivals
.

31:28.360 --> 31:30.000
Now he...

31:30.080 --> 31:31.720
master's maid

31:32.080 --> 31:34.520
I can't bother him at will.

31:37.240 --> 31:39.720
Qian, it feels awkward to say that.

31:43.880 --> 31:46.760
Why don't you look friendly with your cousin?

31:46.840 --> 31:48.080
ma'am?

31:48.600 --> 31:49.840
Where are you?

31:49.920 --> 31:51.280
We are still family...

31:51.360 --> 31:53.640
Even if we stretch.

31:54.520 --> 31:56.680
Oh, yes, you can say it...

31:56.760 --> 31:57.840
If you need anything...

31:57.920 --> 31:59.080
Di Taman species.

31:59.520 --> 32:03.200
We will do our best
to help you...

32:03.280 --> 32:04.560
if i need it

32:29.600 --> 32:31.480
Madam,
he is just Assistant Qi's son...

32:31.560 --> 32:34.000
A person who works at a jongbak.

32:34.080 --> 32:36.480
But it looks like he already lives there.

32:36.560 --> 32:38.120
He is very rude.

32:38.680 --> 32:39.680
Don't look for things with him.

32:39.760 --> 32:42.160
One of those women...

32:42.240 --> 32:45.760
Maybe you will be a lady here someday.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.040
Stupid girl.

32:50.120 --> 32:51.600
That person...

32:51.680 --> 32:53.160
Save these women...

32:53.240 --> 32:54.480
Just because he's bored?

32:58.280 --> 33:01.200
Madam, you are very brave...

33:01.280 --> 33:05.040
They say it has something to do with Hua Man...

33:05.120 --> 33:06.960
Before your majesty and your lord.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.040
That's smart.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.600
look.
thurible.

33:14.680 --> 33:16.120
- Show me this.
- good.

33:18.880 --> 33:20.040
Are you tired?

33:21.560 --> 33:22.760
Absolutely.

33:22.840 --> 33:25.520
You should cover your mouth when you laugh...

33:25.600 --> 33:27.120
In front of my master.

33:27.200 --> 33:28.600
Why did you decide...

33:28.680 --> 33:30.280
Do you want to go to Bell Park today?

33:31.080 --> 33:35.040
It's rare for you to be kind to your aunt...

33:35.320 --> 33:38.120
And I want to spend time with you.

33:38.200 --> 33:40.680
I want to be with him.

33:40.760 --> 33:41.840
why?

33:42.280 --> 33:45.000
He is from the palace.

33:45.080 --> 33:46.640
He is thoughtful.

33:47.120 --> 33:49.120
If you do not mind...

33:49.200 --> 33:51.840
I can have his heart.

33:52.360 --> 33:53.600
I thought about it.

33:53.680 --> 33:55.360
Royal Princess Site...

33:55.440 --> 33:57.280
The only place you can't go with me.

33:58.760 --> 34:00.680
Ah, that's it!
What are you saying, ma'am?

34:00.760 --> 34:02.760
Let go of the reins...

34:02.840 --> 34:04.160
Just to hug that person
better?

34:06.440 --> 34:08.120
You are very smart.

34:08.600 --> 34:11.200
He
will miss you even more now.

34:11.560 --> 34:13.120
Nanfeng should have told me...

34:13.200 --> 34:14.360
Before we go...

34:14.440 --> 34:16.040
I'm taking a break for a month and a half...

34:16.120 --> 34:18.040
To spend more time with you.

34:18.360 --> 34:19.400
halfmoon?

34:27.440 --> 34:28.520
Monarch

34:29.080 --> 34:30.560
The wife has arrived.

34:33.240 --> 34:34.840
Please forgive me, master.

34:42.280 --> 34:44.320
Sir, your wife is coming.

34:51.120 --> 34:52.240
Monarch

34:52.360 --> 34:53.640
The lady came again.

34:55.080 --> 34:56.280
Please forgive me, master.

34:57.080 --> 34:59.760
Master, how are you?

35:00.760 --> 35:02.640
Sir, your wife is here.

35:07.240 --> 35:08.600
- Master...
- Master...

35:08.680 --> 35:09.800
I have come to see my master again.

35:11.320 --> 35:12.440
What do you want to do?

35:12.520 --> 35:13.640
Let me help you.

35:20.680 --> 35:21.680
Tuan.

35:22.440 --> 35:24.400
Sir, your wife is here again.

35:24.840 --> 35:25.880
Once more?

35:30.520 --> 35:32.360
<i>Dwan Handover</i>

35:36.760 --> 35:38.280
Teacher, this bead was made...

35:38.360 --> 35:39.880
From the scent...

35:39.960 --> 35:41.680
It was consecrated by an old monk.

35:41.760 --> 35:42.960
do you like it?

35:47.600 --> 35:49.120
You are good.

35:52.320 --> 35:53.400
What happened ma'am...

35:53.920 --> 35:55.960
During these two weeks?

35:56.760 --> 35:59.400
Why do you come here every day?

35:59.880 --> 36:01.680
You always say that, master...

36:01.760 --> 36:04.880
Treat him like your own child from the time he is young.

36:04.960 --> 36:07.120
He is busy now.

36:07.200 --> 36:09.800
It is my duty to spend time with my master...

36:09.880 --> 36:11.200
For his part.

36:12.680 --> 36:14.880
nice couple.

36:14.960 --> 36:18.040
You make us all jealous.

36:18.640 --> 36:21.840
Yellen has been very busy these days.

36:21.920 --> 36:24.520
Beta will tell him...

36:24.600 --> 36:26.480
Care...

36:26.840 --> 36:30.640
About his family.

36:31.240 --> 36:33.120
He should pay more attention to his career.

36:33.200 --> 36:34.560
Don't worry, master.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.960
I'm serious?

36:37.440 --> 36:38.440
Absolutely.

36:38.520 --> 36:40.640
Don't tell him to do something else.

36:52.560 --> 36:54.560
Your Majesty, the Queen
commands the people...

36:54.640 --> 36:56.160
This lich was sent from the south.

36:57.640 --> 37:00.240
Of course it takes time and energy, but...

37:00.320 --> 37:02.560
To send this lich...

37:02.640 --> 37:04.560
This season.

37:04.840 --> 37:08.440
Her Majesty
loves my lord very much.

37:09.960 --> 37:11.760
It's not beta.

37:11.840 --> 37:14.520
His grandson loves Richie.

37:14.960 --> 37:16.640
Send it to Siwoo.

37:16.920 --> 37:18.400
Yes, master.

37:18.960 --> 37:21.280
Su Wuniang seems to be busy.

37:21.960 --> 37:24.040
I'm free now.

37:24.640 --> 37:27.120
I can take it.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.560
You take advantage of every opportunity you have.

37:30.640 --> 37:32.840
How dare you accept a compliment...

37:32.920 --> 37:34.600
At my lord's suggestion?

37:34.680 --> 37:37.800
Teacher Qi, I miss your misunderstanding.

37:38.520 --> 37:42.040
I just want to help my master.

37:45.560 --> 37:47.760
<i>Larger residences...</i>

37:47.840 --> 37:49.400
<i>More tricks.</i>

37:53.520 --> 37:57.040
Now you are free.

37:57.320 --> 38:00.520
What do you mean, send me this lich?

38:01.600 --> 38:02.600
me?

38:05.600 --> 38:07.440
<i>This is a smart move.</i>

38:07.520 --> 38:09.280
<i>Your Majesty is accustomed to palace life.</i>

38:09.760 --> 38:12.120
<i> With just one action, His Majesty resolved</i> <i>their conflict.</i>

38:12.200 --> 38:13.800
Follow my orders, my lord.

38:36.760 --> 38:37.760
Tuan.

38:40.280 --> 38:42.040
Your Majesty has instructed...

38:42.120 --> 38:43.400
To get the lychee.

39:13.360 --> 39:14.840
Do you know how to read a ledger?

39:18.760 --> 39:19.840
Look at this ledger.

39:31.760 --> 39:32.840
Cash payment details are being recorded.

39:32.920 --> 39:34.800
What did your brother do...

39:34.880 --> 39:36.880
At the store in your father's name.

39:37.320 --> 39:39.440
Do you think your father knows?

39:40.440 --> 39:42.120
I also heard another assistant say:

39:42.200 --> 39:44.440
Your brother always
spends a lot of money...

39:44.520 --> 39:45.840
In a brothel.

39:46.760 --> 39:49.160
Didn't your father really teach him?

39:49.760 --> 39:53.040
Or did your father
do the same?

39:56.840 --> 40:00.120
Teacher, my younger brother
liked to show off from a young age.

40:00.200 --> 40:02.040
My father is busy working at the store.

40:02.440 --> 40:04.440
So I couldn't educate my younger brother well...

40:04.920 --> 40:06.560
And let him escape.

40:07.520 --> 40:08.600
How do you feel?

40:08.960 --> 40:12.560
Should we punish him for his actions
?

40:26.600 --> 40:27.880
Shen is my younger brother.

40:28.200 --> 40:29.200
He is my family.

40:29.280 --> 40:31.800
Even though he
made a lot of mistakes...

40:31.880 --> 40:34.280
I don't know how to punish that person
...

40:34.560 --> 40:35.840
Because he is old...

40:35.920 --> 40:37.400
And I'm just a girl.

40:38.080 --> 40:40.480
You are smart and know how.

40:40.560 --> 40:41.960
I shouldn't make suggestions.

40:42.280 --> 40:44.000
Hua's assistant always brags...

40:44.080 --> 40:46.560
That daughter is perfect.

40:46.640 --> 40:49.320
Why are you stuck in front of me?

40:49.600 --> 40:51.840
Your parents might consider...

40:51.920 --> 40:53.680
Their kids are the best.

40:53.760 --> 40:56.000
Exaggeration is inevitable.

41:17.480 --> 41:20.240
<i>Lakaman Bonus</i>

41:27.600 --> 41:29.120
You are back.

41:29.200 --> 41:31.520
He asked about the owner earlier.

41:31.600 --> 41:32.880
I went out quietly.

41:32.960 --> 41:34.280
You caught me again.

41:34.360 --> 41:35.480
Please keep this a secret from me.

41:36.960 --> 41:38.480
Are you going to buy dessert for your mom?

41:40.320 --> 41:41.680
That's the only reason...

41:41.760 --> 41:43.040
Let me wander.

41:44.920 --> 41:46.920
Why did you go out alone?

41:47.000 --> 41:48.640
You need to bring a security guard.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.280
I have a security guard.

41:50.360 --> 41:52.120
They are hiding.

41:52.560 --> 41:54.240
I won't be free...

41:54.320 --> 41:55.440
If I am with a group of security guards .

41:57.240 --> 41:58.840
OK.
I will return first.

41:59.280 --> 42:00.280
See you again, seniors.

42:03.240 --> 42:04.240
difference.

42:05.960 --> 42:08.640
Your new wife has changed a lot.

42:09.440 --> 42:10.560
I met him today.

42:10.920 --> 42:12.840
He
now reminds me of his father.
