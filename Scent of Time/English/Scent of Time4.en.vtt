01:35.360 --> 01:37.680
<i>Episode 13</i>

01:39.320 --> 01:40.320
Taste this.

01:40.680 --> 01:42.240
I'm full.
You need to eat too.

01:42.320 --> 01:43.320
ma'am...

01:43.400 --> 01:44.600
Something happened to Young Master Hua.

01:50.680 --> 01:52.080
I eat too much.

01:52.160 --> 01:53.160
Excuse me for a moment.

01:53.720 --> 01:54.840
Why did he leave?

01:54.920 --> 01:56.480
That's not important.
You guys just keep going.

01:57.680 --> 01:58.720
Stay here and watch it all.

02:00.280 --> 02:02.640
- Why did you leave?
- What happen?

02:02.720 --> 02:04.840
It is nothing.
Keep eating and drinking.

02:05.840 --> 02:07.120
Please bring another bottle of wine.

02:07.200 --> 02:08.320
Let's move on.

02:09.200 --> 02:10.200
What did my brother do this time?

02:10.880 --> 02:12.480
Currently, Master Hwayoung...

02:13.200 --> 02:14.840
It was in Concubine Mu's room.

02:16.640 --> 02:17.640
What does it mean?

02:17.720 --> 02:19.040
I don't know exactly.

02:19.120 --> 02:20.920
The waiter came to report...

02:21.000 --> 02:22.280
Master Hwayoung infiltrated...

02:22.360 --> 02:23.360
To the room of Concubine Wu.

02:38.960 --> 02:40.880
Sister, wake up.

02:41.280 --> 02:42.360
Check out Mu Yao.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.280
sisters.

02:44.360 --> 02:45.480
Concubine Mu.

02:47.320 --> 02:48.760
sisters.

02:48.840 --> 02:49.840
wake up.

02:50.320 --> 02:51.320
sisters!

02:53.360 --> 02:54.360
Kian.

03:01.120 --> 03:02.120
blood.

03:02.200 --> 03:03.200
What happen?

03:11.480 --> 03:12.480
Yao.

03:14.480 --> 03:15.560
are you okay?

03:15.800 --> 03:16.880
Tuan.

03:20.560 --> 03:21.760
I'm doing great.

03:22.640 --> 03:24.800
Fortunately, Jisoo arrived on time...

03:25.360 --> 03:26.440
but...

03:26.760 --> 03:31.480
By mistake,
Young Master Hua was injured.

03:39.840 --> 03:41.680
- teacher.
- teacher.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.760
Calm down and listen to me.

03:44.520 --> 03:45.520
ma'am.

03:46.280 --> 03:47.280
ma'am!

03:47.440 --> 03:48.640
Is your wife okay?

03:49.200 --> 03:50.200
Please show me your hands.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.640
My hands are bleeding.

04:10.480 --> 04:11.480
Huarongzhou.

04:11.560 --> 04:13.520
- teacher.
- Back off!

04:13.600 --> 04:14.760
Sir, please listen to me.

04:15.160 --> 04:16.640
calm down.
Let’s find out more...

04:16.720 --> 04:18.480
Before doing something irreversible
.

04:18.560 --> 04:19.560
Please don't disturb me.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.800
Sir, don't kill him first.

04:21.880 --> 04:23.600
How about we find out what's going on?

04:23.680 --> 04:24.760
Before punishing him?

04:24.840 --> 04:26.440
Let's find out what happened?

04:27.360 --> 04:29.400
Do you really not understand your brother’s personality?

04:30.520 --> 04:31.760
No wonder you asked His Majesty...

04:31.840 --> 04:33.520
So I make Mu Yao my concubine.

04:34.360 --> 04:35.480
It seems...

04:35.880 --> 04:38.360
You and your brother
have been planning this all along!

04:39.240 --> 04:41.640
I know I lied to you many times
...

04:41.720 --> 04:44.040
So
I don't blame you for not trusting me now.

04:44.120 --> 04:45.280
But these are two different things.

04:45.360 --> 04:47.560
- Sir, calm down...
- I won't kill you...

04:48.000 --> 04:49.800
But I'm going to cripple his arm...

04:49.880 --> 04:51.880
So that he can learn to take care of his hands!

04:52.480 --> 04:53.720
Kian.

04:53.800 --> 04:55.440
Save me, Chen.

04:55.520 --> 04:56.680
Save me, Chen.

04:57.200 --> 04:58.200
Kian.

05:00.120 --> 05:01.240
Aren't you moving?

05:03.240 --> 05:04.280
Kian.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.320
Kian.

05:34.440 --> 05:35.840
Calm down, senior.

05:48.320 --> 05:52.720
Looks like you want to fight me too.

06:03.600 --> 06:04.880
What does mudamuda mean?

06:06.120 --> 06:08.040
Are you defending this useless person?

06:10.640 --> 06:13.280
Hua Shen
was the only son of Chief Steward Hua.

06:15.080 --> 06:16.480
I understand how you feel, sir.

06:16.560 --> 06:18.600
However, be reasonable.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.920
He
treated my girl rudely today.

06:24.640 --> 06:25.800
It means that the person may be avoiding responsibility...

06:25.880 --> 06:27.080
Who is that person?

06:27.480 --> 06:28.960
I'm not defending him.

06:29.560 --> 06:31.200
I think it's better...

06:31.280 --> 06:32.640
Put that person in jail first...

06:32.720 --> 06:35.760
And wait until Judge Wang
investigates.

06:41.760 --> 06:44.000
There are more important things to do today.

06:45.880 --> 06:47.000
Page...

06:47.560 --> 06:48.560
Judge Wang
will not protect Hua Shen...

06:48.640 --> 06:49.680
If you see him.

07:04.520 --> 07:05.560
He got away easily.

07:41.520 --> 07:42.600
What are you going to do?

07:42.680 --> 07:43.800
Where will you take me?

07:43.880 --> 07:45.560
Please help me, Qian.

07:45.640 --> 07:46.720
Thank you to Teacher Young for your help.

07:52.640 --> 07:53.640
Go back home...

07:53.720 --> 07:54.800
And treat your wounds.

07:54.880 --> 07:55.880
But there were many people in the front yard.

07:55.960 --> 07:57.080
Leave it to me.

07:57.800 --> 07:58.800
Take a break and come back again.

08:00.880 --> 08:01.960
See you again, Young Master.

08:03.440 --> 08:04.440
ma'am.

08:06.200 --> 08:07.280
ma'am.

08:11.360 --> 08:12.360
are you okay?

08:12.840 --> 08:13.920
I'm doing great.

08:15.520 --> 08:16.520
Please forgive.

08:17.480 --> 08:18.600
Madam, I'm sorry.

08:19.520 --> 08:20.960
There is no need to apologize.

08:21.240 --> 08:23.400
good job.
I have to thank you.

08:24.240 --> 08:26.760
It doesn't seem weak.

08:27.360 --> 08:28.600
thank you.

08:28.680 --> 08:30.840
See a therapist later.

08:33.560 --> 08:34.600
be careful.

08:41.760 --> 08:42.760
I will help you.

09:31.160 --> 09:32.400
Bring this for him.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.440
Hang in there, madam.

09:55.600 --> 09:56.600
It really hurts.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.400
wait. Almost done.

10:08.480 --> 10:09.840
Hello, Young Master.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.360
- Young Master.
- Young Master.

10:12.440 --> 10:13.440
let's do it.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.480
Teacher, why are you doing that...

10:18.560 --> 10:21.080
are you okay.
Customers are well taken care of...

10:21.160 --> 10:22.440
And they will be back as we speak.

10:23.560 --> 10:25.960
Young Master,
please let Yinxing do it.

10:33.480 --> 10:35.280
Not sure if I can do it?

10:35.360 --> 10:36.480
It's not like that.

10:36.560 --> 10:38.840
It seems inappropriate to ask you to do this.

11:07.840 --> 11:10.080
Young Master,
how about you make me faint...

11:10.160 --> 11:11.160
Before treating the wound?

11:13.560 --> 11:14.880
Low pain tolerance.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.440
Why are you protecting Hua Shen?

11:21.320 --> 11:22.680
After all, he is my brother.

12:00.760 --> 12:02.160
Is it very fast? I am new...

12:11.440 --> 12:13.120
I kept hesitating...

12:13.560 --> 12:16.920
But as you know,
seniors need answers.

12:17.560 --> 12:19.040
The teacher was very angry today.

12:19.760 --> 12:20.960
Young Master, aren’t you angry?

12:21.520 --> 12:22.920
Why should I be angry?

12:23.200 --> 12:24.680
Why is Young Master helping me?

12:27.680 --> 12:29.720
<i>You're not trying to test me, are you?</i>

12:31.440 --> 12:33.640
You keep my secrets...

12:34.880 --> 12:36.360
Save it.

12:36.720 --> 12:38.960
We are on the same side now.

12:39.600 --> 12:40.840
<i>Is that person so boring...</i>

12:40.920 --> 12:43.560
<i>Until he has to say</i>
<i>Who does he respect?</i>

12:46.440 --> 12:48.520
great. I'm going.

13:07.440 --> 13:08.600
ma'am.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.120
When I went to the doctor to ask for medicine...

13:11.200 --> 13:12.960
I saw bodyguard Hua take out a medicine bottle...

13:13.040 --> 13:14.640
And then he hurried out.

13:15.120 --> 13:17.000
I said hello, but
he didn't even notice me.

13:17.280 --> 13:19.000
I wonder what the wound is like.

13:19.680 --> 13:21.080
When you return...

13:21.160 --> 13:22.640
I saw him standing at the door.

13:23.320 --> 13:24.920
Was he hurt too?

13:25.880 --> 13:27.080
I do not know.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.680
I didn't look closely.

13:30.120 --> 13:32.040
I fell on a chair...

13:32.120 --> 13:33.520
And it was definitely scratched.

13:34.560 --> 13:35.560
Tsuiju.

13:36.560 --> 13:38.640
Check out Huang Rongzhou.

13:45.440 --> 13:46.840
What's the problem?

13:47.240 --> 13:48.640
Normally, I'm always happy...

13:48.720 --> 13:50.360
Take the opportunity to access Rongzhou
.

13:50.440 --> 13:52.360
But not today.

13:52.640 --> 13:54.680
Maybe he was worried about her.

13:58.560 --> 13:59.680
Save your medicine.

14:19.360 --> 14:22.520
Madam, can you feel it...

14:22.600 --> 14:25.680
Does Young Master treat you differently?

14:25.760 --> 14:27.040
Of course
he treated me differently.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.800
What will you do, wife?

14:33.120 --> 14:34.120
You don't understand.

14:34.520 --> 14:36.560
That person treats me like that...

14:37.360 --> 14:40.840
Because I know the secret.

14:40.920 --> 14:41.920
secret?

14:42.200 --> 14:43.760
What does it mean?

14:43.840 --> 14:45.760
Secret.
How should I say it?

15:04.600 --> 15:05.720
Kian.

15:06.440 --> 15:07.520
What does the teacher say?

15:10.640 --> 15:12.280
I never had a chance to meet Mr. Lee.

15:12.760 --> 15:14.720
Yesterday, mom
asked your dad.

15:15.520 --> 15:16.720
They said Master sent your younger brother...

15:16.800 --> 15:18.000
Ke <i>Yamen</i>...

15:18.320 --> 15:19.960
above...

15:20.040 --> 15:21.680
About that shameful behavior.

15:21.760 --> 15:23.560
He can't interfere...

15:23.640 --> 15:26.000
When the incident comes to light.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.080
So
we need your help to learn more.

15:29.800 --> 15:33.080
- I have a plan.
- That's not enough.

15:34.360 --> 15:36.440
Your brother never suffered.

15:37.240 --> 15:39.080
How will he
survive in prison?

15:39.440 --> 15:41.680
How can he survive?

15:42.880 --> 15:44.480
I won't just sit still...

15:44.560 --> 15:47.120
But we need to find the root cause of the problem...

15:47.200 --> 15:48.320
Before finding a solution.

15:50.160 --> 15:51.800
Mom isn't there...

15:51.880 --> 15:53.160
Yesterday when he was taken away.

15:53.240 --> 15:55.520
Why didn't you stop them?

15:55.600 --> 15:57.920
He is your only brother.

15:59.360 --> 16:01.720
When your mom was pregnant with you...

16:01.800 --> 16:03.520
I touch my mom's belly every day...

16:03.600 --> 16:05.600
And he said he would protect you...

16:05.680 --> 16:06.800
After you were born.

16:07.120 --> 16:09.160
Now he's in trouble...

16:09.240 --> 16:11.440
But are you just sitting here?

16:11.800 --> 16:12.800
Mother, don't worry.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.560
If something truly unfair happened to my sister...

16:14.640 --> 16:16.240
I won't stay still.

16:16.320 --> 16:17.720
You have never been to prison.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.680
How do we know who framed him?

16:20.360 --> 16:23.040
My mother asked Judge Wang for help...

16:23.120 --> 16:24.520
But he wouldn't let me in.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.440
He said his mother would be able to visit him in a few days.

16:26.520 --> 16:28.080
How many more days?

16:28.360 --> 16:31.960
Your brother won't survive prison.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.680
He will suffer.

16:35.400 --> 16:39.560
What happened in this house...

16:39.640 --> 16:41.280
And you are Mr.'s wife.

16:41.360 --> 16:42.360
Mom feels...

16:42.440 --> 16:44.240
The judge will not prevent you from entering.

16:44.320 --> 16:45.640
My brother was just taken...

16:45.720 --> 16:47.120
And I don't know yet...

16:47.200 --> 16:48.600
What actually happened yesterday?

16:48.680 --> 16:51.320
What good will it do me if I go to jail now?

16:51.400 --> 16:52.880
So
what can you do while sitting here?

16:53.440 --> 16:54.440
Mom knows...

16:54.560 --> 16:56.680
You always
think you're embarrassed...

16:57.120 --> 16:59.440
And it's not you who suffer in prison...

16:59.520 --> 17:01.160
Therefore, it is natural that you are not anxious.

17:02.720 --> 17:04.360
I think he's embarrassed?

17:04.440 --> 17:05.520
To be more precise,
his inappropriate behavior was...

17:05.600 --> 17:06.680
It makes us feel ashamed.

17:06.760 --> 17:08.200
It's true that I haven't been there yet.

17:08.280 --> 17:09.800
But why be anxious?

17:09.880 --> 17:11.040
Making a big fuss...

17:11.120 --> 17:12.120
Before solving the problem...

17:12.200 --> 17:13.480
It only makes us vulnerable.

17:14.560 --> 17:16.360
Mother, how can you be sure that he is innocent?

17:16.440 --> 17:17.560
Maybe he deserves it...

17:17.640 --> 17:18.800
His current situation.

17:19.320 --> 17:20.640
Since I came here...

17:20.720 --> 17:22.000
Mom can't stop talking...

17:22.080 --> 17:23.800
How much my brother
will suffer in prison.

17:23.880 --> 17:26.080
Did you see that my hand was hurt?

17:26.160 --> 17:27.440
And ask about it?

17:31.720 --> 17:32.720
- Mom...
- That's it.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.120
My mother always takes my brother's side...

17:34.200 --> 17:35.200
And I got used to it.

17:35.440 --> 17:37.840
If you don't get a proper answer from me...

17:37.920 --> 17:39.600
I don't think mom will let me go easily
.

17:40.320 --> 17:41.880
Now let's go to jail.

17:42.640 --> 17:45.760
Find out who framed your sister
.

17:49.160 --> 17:53.640
Madam, you said something hurtful
.

17:54.880 --> 17:57.080
I had too much trouble choosing my words carefully.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.720
First, let's get Shen out of jail.

17:59.560 --> 18:01.600
<i>Pengadilan Yellow Blue</i>

18:02.520 --> 18:03.600
Here it is.

18:04.360 --> 18:05.600
Kian.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.040
Qian, I was waiting...

18:08.120 --> 18:10.800
All day.

18:10.880 --> 18:13.280
Don't you understand what's going on?

18:13.360 --> 18:15.200
I worked really hard to get in here.

18:15.280 --> 18:16.720
My mother is not allowed in.

18:16.800 --> 18:19.200
Are you here to take me out?
Isn't that right?

18:20.680 --> 18:22.760
It's not that easy, brother.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.360
I've said it many times.

18:24.440 --> 18:25.640
Mu Yao is not someone you can touch.

18:25.720 --> 18:27.520
Why don't you listen to me?

18:27.600 --> 18:30.760
I remember everything you said.

18:30.840 --> 18:34.240
I
won't touch anyone you tell me not to.

18:34.320 --> 18:35.920
Why don't you trust me?

18:36.240 --> 18:37.760
So what happened yesterday?

18:37.840 --> 18:39.160
Why did I come to Mu Yao's room...

18:39.240 --> 18:40.600
With dirty clothes?

18:42.160 --> 18:43.800
I really don't know.

18:43.880 --> 18:46.240
I drank too much yesterday.

18:46.320 --> 18:47.640
I
tried to regain consciousness in the backyard.

18:47.720 --> 18:50.760
One of your servants
reminded me...

18:50.840 --> 18:51.840
To stay there.

18:52.360 --> 18:55.480
So I stayed in the pavilion.

18:58.200 --> 18:59.200
so?

18:59.360 --> 19:02.000
Then I...

19:02.640 --> 19:03.680
Looks like you want to stay here...

19:03.760 --> 19:04.800
A few more days.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.680
I will say

19:07.800 --> 19:13.560
I saw a beautiful maid in the backyard...

19:13.640 --> 19:15.720
And he seduced me.

19:16.080 --> 19:19.160
I'm drunk...

19:19.240 --> 19:21.120
So I
followed him somewhere.

19:21.200 --> 19:22.680
Soon after,
I lost consciousness.

19:23.120 --> 19:26.360
When I woke up,
I saw you in front of me.

19:27.640 --> 19:30.240
I'm so scared I can't speak.
me...

19:31.360 --> 19:35.360
Are you sure the maid seduced you?

19:35.440 --> 19:37.040
He kept spying on me.

19:37.120 --> 19:38.920
Doesn't that mean he likes me?

19:41.160 --> 19:43.080
You are so confident!

19:43.160 --> 19:44.160
I drank too much alcohol...

19:44.240 --> 19:45.240
And act according to your physical desires.

19:45.320 --> 19:46.320
But you
excuse yourself.

19:46.400 --> 19:48.720
No one can control themselves when they are drunk.

19:49.360 --> 19:50.360
I think my assessment is correct...

19:50.440 --> 19:53.120
Affected by excessive alcohol.

19:53.200 --> 19:55.320
So I
think he's interested in me...

19:55.400 --> 19:56.440
And I broke in by mistake ...

19:56.520 --> 19:57.520
To someone's residence...

19:57.600 --> 19:59.120
And it looks like a pervert.

19:59.200 --> 20:01.400
Qian, it's not my fault.

20:02.400 --> 20:05.280
You said it with conviction.

20:05.360 --> 20:06.440
It looks okay...

20:06.520 --> 20:07.640
Although our mothers say it differently.

20:07.720 --> 20:08.880
In that case...

20:09.400 --> 20:11.440
Stay here and
repent for a few more days.

20:11.520 --> 20:12.840
Kian.

20:13.200 --> 20:14.440
Save me, Chen.

20:14.520 --> 20:16.000
This place is dirty and smells really bad.

20:16.080 --> 20:17.440
There are also rats.

20:17.520 --> 20:20.840
The guards tortured me.

20:20.920 --> 20:24.080
I don't think I can last a few more days .

20:24.160 --> 20:25.560
Kian.

20:25.640 --> 20:26.720
Is it true?

20:26.800 --> 20:28.440
A wound on my head...

20:28.520 --> 20:29.760
It healed well.

20:30.320 --> 20:32.280
I don't think you were tortured.

20:32.360 --> 20:35.280
- I...
- Learn from this.

20:35.360 --> 20:36.360
Kian!

20:36.440 --> 20:38.640
Kian.

20:38.720 --> 20:40.040
Kian!

20:41.720 --> 20:42.720
Kian.

20:56.160 --> 20:57.400
How is your sister?

21:07.520 --> 21:09.680
I warned him many times...

21:10.640 --> 21:11.760
But his physical desires...

21:11.840 --> 21:13.000
Always master.

21:13.800 --> 21:14.800
This time...

21:15.560 --> 21:19.800
He even
did that in your house.

21:20.520 --> 21:22.400
He deserves to be beaten.

21:24.160 --> 21:25.320
You think too...

21:25.600 --> 21:27.560
Is that person the criminal?

21:31.360 --> 21:32.520
Kian.

21:33.360 --> 21:34.400
your sister...

21:35.960 --> 21:38.000
It's quite immoral...

21:38.720 --> 21:39.720
But that person did...

21:40.560 --> 21:42.760
Because he was drunk.

21:42.840 --> 21:46.760
That person is my only son...

21:46.840 --> 21:48.600
And you only have one brother.

21:49.360 --> 21:51.000
Even if you get angry at me...

21:51.360 --> 21:53.000
You can't leave him in trouble
.

21:53.760 --> 21:54.920
my beloved daughter

21:55.560 --> 21:56.920
Why should I be angry?

21:57.440 --> 22:00.480
I don't think he did that.

22:01.760 --> 22:02.760
Is it true?

22:19.400 --> 22:20.920
Hello, madam.

22:21.400 --> 22:23.000
You are my servant.
No format required.

22:24.480 --> 22:26.600
I have a few questions
.

22:27.160 --> 22:29.040
Have you seen anything strange...?

22:29.120 --> 22:30.600
The day you went to look for my sister?

22:31.720 --> 22:34.120
I went to the backyard...

22:34.480 --> 22:35.480
Muda Hua was sitting alone...

22:35.560 --> 22:36.560
In the pavilion.

22:36.640 --> 22:37.680
They say the servant left...

22:37.760 --> 22:38.960
Buy him some hangover soup.

22:39.400 --> 22:40.400
What he said was...

22:40.480 --> 22:41.480
After I deliver my message?

22:41.800 --> 22:44.640
He said he drank too much...

22:44.720 --> 22:46.680
And I want to rest there.

22:46.760 --> 22:48.960
He asked me to tell Mrs. Hua...

22:49.280 --> 22:50.680
Coming to the pavilion to look for him...

22:50.760 --> 22:51.760
After the banquet was over.

22:52.920 --> 22:55.720
Who did you tell that he was in the pavilion?

22:55.800 --> 22:56.800
no.

23:02.160 --> 23:04.680
Did you meet someone on your way home?

23:04.760 --> 23:05.920
I haven't met anyone.

23:13.360 --> 23:14.480
ma'am.

23:14.960 --> 23:17.040
What did I do wrong?

23:23.400 --> 23:24.400
It has nothing to do with you.

23:24.480 --> 23:26.480
Don't think too much about it.
Go and rest.

23:41.520 --> 23:43.560
Madam, what is Cuizhu doing?

23:45.560 --> 23:47.400
There is nothing. I'm just sure...

23:47.480 --> 23:48.880
To make myself calm.

23:52.160 --> 23:53.720
Where does Mu Yao live now?

23:53.800 --> 23:55.200
same as before...

23:55.280 --> 23:56.560
But it has been renovated.

23:58.520 --> 23:59.520
good.

24:09.120 --> 24:10.120
ma'am.

24:11.280 --> 24:12.800
The teacher got angry last time...

24:12.880 --> 24:14.480
So he's a bit over the top.

24:14.560 --> 24:16.080
You may have suffered serious injuries.

24:16.160 --> 24:17.440
You don't have to be awake.

24:17.520 --> 24:18.760
Go back to your room and rest.

24:19.400 --> 24:20.400
I'm doing great.

24:33.920 --> 24:35.320
What are you guys doing?

24:36.880 --> 24:38.000
ma'am.

24:38.120 --> 24:39.400
The Lord has commanded us to take care...

24:39.480 --> 24:40.800
Your concubine's residence.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.680
No one can enter.

24:43.120 --> 24:44.120
you...

24:45.800 --> 24:48.720
Please tell Mu Yao that I am coming.
He will let me in.

25:05.440 --> 25:07.040
Please, ma'am.

25:34.520 --> 25:35.760
Please wait outside.

25:38.360 --> 25:39.360
Okay, ma'am.

26:04.520 --> 26:06.160
You were waiting for me, right?

26:09.080 --> 26:11.280
If you come to defend Hua Shen...

26:11.360 --> 26:13.120
Shouldn’t we be humble?

26:13.600 --> 26:15.320
My brother is innocent.

26:15.400 --> 26:16.840
Why should I defend him?

26:18.840 --> 26:20.760
Mu Yao, it's just the two of us now.

26:21.240 --> 26:22.760
Let’s get straight to the point.

26:23.440 --> 26:24.520
I think...

26:24.600 --> 26:26.640
I wouldn't use such a cunning method
...

26:26.720 --> 26:29.880
After being locked up before.

26:30.440 --> 26:32.360
I realized I was wrong.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.880
I'm really disappointed.

26:36.320 --> 26:38.400
I didn't mean to come here...

26:38.480 --> 26:40.400
But I think I have to do my part...

26:40.480 --> 26:42.560
In your play...

26:42.640 --> 26:44.880
Don't let your hard work go to waste.

26:46.640 --> 26:49.320
I told you I wouldn't compete with you anymore...

26:49.400 --> 26:50.560
Demi Jong-ye is...

26:50.920 --> 26:52.480
But you don't believe me.

26:53.280 --> 26:56.600
You even used a cunning method...

26:56.680 --> 26:58.320
And
used it to get rid of me.

27:00.520 --> 27:04.320
Do you think I'm doing this for him?

27:04.400 --> 27:06.000
What else?

27:12.200 --> 27:13.840
You framed Hua Shen.

27:14.160 --> 27:16.040
This time I won't stand still.

27:16.120 --> 27:18.160
Every injustice has a perpetrator.

27:18.240 --> 27:19.240
I am patient with you...

27:19.320 --> 27:21.800
Because I
regret what I did to you.

27:22.120 --> 27:24.280
But now you're
implicating innocent people...

27:24.360 --> 27:26.000
Using cunning means.

27:26.680 --> 27:28.320
I will never be generous again.

27:33.120 --> 27:35.080
Every injustice has a perpetrator.

27:37.360 --> 27:38.360
Hua Chen.

27:39.400 --> 27:42.000
How dare you say that?

27:45.880 --> 27:47.040
Why can't I say that
?

27:58.720 --> 27:59.800
Tuan.

28:00.120 --> 28:01.640
Judge Wang sent more people.

28:01.720 --> 28:03.240
This is related to the Hua Shen incident.

28:03.320 --> 28:04.760
They want to ask Mu-cheop a question.

28:05.120 --> 28:06.720
Should we make them wait outside like before?

28:26.400 --> 28:27.480
Let it wait.

28:28.120 --> 28:29.120
All right.

28:29.520 --> 28:30.520
wait.

28:33.800 --> 28:34.960
Let me ask you first.

28:37.720 --> 28:39.680
Your family are selfish people...

28:39.760 --> 28:42.960
A person who cannot distinguish between right and wrong.

28:43.800 --> 28:45.880
You said Hua Shen was innocent, right?

28:47.120 --> 28:50.040
You were the one who prepared the banquet incident, right?

28:50.600 --> 28:53.080
I really question my brother's morality...

28:53.160 --> 28:54.200
But he never...

28:54.280 --> 28:55.360
You have bad intentions.

28:56.920 --> 28:57.920
Is it true?

28:58.240 --> 28:59.560
I can't guarantee anything else, but...

28:59.640 --> 29:02.400
I can tell you that he
has never lied to me.

29:02.480 --> 29:04.440
I warned him many times
...

29:04.520 --> 29:06.600
And he always
respected my requests.

29:07.120 --> 29:08.840
In the end, you...

29:12.280 --> 29:15.320
I have known you for a long time.

29:15.640 --> 29:19.360
You are a person who does not shed tears easily
.

29:20.080 --> 29:21.400
That day, you
were curled up in the corner of your room...

29:21.480 --> 29:22.840
Trembling with fear.

29:23.600 --> 29:25.000
It's just acting.

29:25.480 --> 29:27.840
Your intentions are clear.

29:30.080 --> 29:31.080
You are right.

29:32.360 --> 29:34.320
I locked him up.

29:34.640 --> 29:36.960
Hua Shen didn't touch me at all
.

29:41.360 --> 29:42.800
I heard the news that the servant died...

29:42.880 --> 29:44.320
A few days ago at Hua Residence...

29:45.240 --> 29:46.440
But Mr. Hwa appeared at the banquet...

29:46.520 --> 29:48.040
Without any indication of the outcome.

29:48.640 --> 29:50.920
Head Servant Hwa
acts as a shield for the family.

29:51.440 --> 29:53.480
Of course you guys aren't there...

29:54.480 --> 29:56.800
Who cares about the life of a servant?

29:59.880 --> 30:00.880
What does it mean?

30:10.280 --> 30:11.920
Waiter commits suicide

30:12.880 --> 30:14.080
This is Linglong.

30:22.880 --> 30:25.680
Your father told us to buy this.

30:25.760 --> 30:27.520
The young lady has reached marriageable age.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.520
So you need to get dressed.

30:29.600 --> 30:30.960
Look at the jewels.

30:31.400 --> 30:32.400
Very beautiful.

30:34.440 --> 30:35.600
do you like

30:35.680 --> 30:36.840
I'll give it to you.

30:37.440 --> 30:38.560
I am a waiter.

30:38.640 --> 30:40.680
How can I use this precious thing?

30:43.200 --> 30:44.680
Why not?

30:48.720 --> 30:49.800
This one.

30:56.240 --> 30:57.560
That's inappropriate.

30:57.640 --> 30:58.760
Put it in.

30:59.880 --> 31:01.000
It's right for you.

31:01.480 --> 31:03.640
He said he had reached marriageable age.

31:04.200 --> 31:06.680
But you are one year older than me.

31:06.760 --> 31:08.400
This hairpin
will be your dowry.

31:09.240 --> 31:10.320
dowry?

31:10.400 --> 31:11.600
Nona...

31:11.680 --> 31:13.000
What are you talking about?

31:13.800 --> 31:14.920
It won't run.

31:19.400 --> 31:21.080
Linglong lost his parents when he was young...

31:21.360 --> 31:23.120
And he grew up with me in the North.

31:23.880 --> 31:25.520
You remember him, right?

31:28.160 --> 31:29.720
Some are more beautiful.

31:31.480 --> 31:32.960
Go ahead and try it. Cheers.

31:35.560 --> 31:38.400
The servant was once a criminal.

31:38.480 --> 31:39.840
He is an orphan...

31:39.920 --> 31:41.040
And I have no family.

31:50.520 --> 31:51.680
My father was scolded...

31:51.760 --> 31:52.760
Stealing property...

31:52.840 --> 31:54.160
And isolated.

31:54.240 --> 31:55.400
All the servants in my house...

31:55.480 --> 31:56.640
For sale.

31:57.400 --> 31:58.400
Still a slave...

31:58.480 --> 31:59.920
Wherever it is sold.

32:00.640 --> 32:02.400
At first I thought so too.

32:02.800 --> 32:03.960
but...

32:04.760 --> 32:06.680
Why Hua Shen...

32:06.760 --> 32:07.840
Who bought it?

32:08.920 --> 32:09.920
dare!

32:10.640 --> 32:11.640
dare!

32:11.720 --> 32:13.360
- You will beat me!
- Hwa sister...

32:13.440 --> 32:14.440
- You will beat me!
- Hwa sister...

32:14.520 --> 32:15.520
Stop...

32:15.600 --> 32:17.600
I pity him.

32:18.440 --> 32:20.480
How ungrateful.

32:20.760 --> 32:22.600
You should thank your lucky stars...

32:22.680 --> 32:24.760
Because my friend likes you.

32:24.840 --> 32:26.200
How dare you refuse...

32:26.280 --> 32:29.480
Did you even hit Huang?

32:29.920 --> 32:31.400
Who do you think you are?

32:31.480 --> 32:32.680
I was wrong.

32:33.120 --> 32:34.640
I'm sorry, husband.

32:34.720 --> 32:35.840
Are you my concubine?

32:36.400 --> 32:37.560
My concubine?

32:38.680 --> 32:40.360
I don't consider you my concubine.

32:40.560 --> 32:42.320
You lowly slave...

32:42.400 --> 32:45.600
And I bought you!

32:45.680 --> 32:47.160
You get angry easily, don't you?

32:47.880 --> 32:51.360
good. I am a good person...

32:51.440 --> 32:52.440
Well, I'll leave it to you this time.

32:53.560 --> 32:55.960
Now pack your bags...

32:56.040 --> 32:57.600
And go with Tuan Wang.

32:57.680 --> 32:58.680
Can you hear me?

32:59.240 --> 33:01.360
my husband...

33:02.640 --> 33:04.320
What does it mean?

33:04.760 --> 33:08.320
I mean,
from now on you are mine.

33:09.120 --> 33:10.120
It really is.

33:10.200 --> 33:11.320
my husband.

33:11.560 --> 33:13.440
A woman
cannot serve two husbands.

33:13.760 --> 33:15.880
How can you hand me over?

33:16.680 --> 33:18.040
Who do you think you are?

33:18.720 --> 33:20.280
You are just a lowly servant!

33:20.360 --> 33:22.440
I can hand you over to anyone!

33:24.440 --> 33:25.760
are you okay.

33:25.840 --> 33:27.840
My home is like his home.

33:28.200 --> 33:29.560
I will treat you well.

33:30.160 --> 33:31.280
If you don't want to, that's okay.

33:31.360 --> 33:34.600
Take this.
I'll sell you to a brothel!

33:34.680 --> 33:35.800
Do you want me to do that?

33:37.280 --> 33:38.280
Oh no.

33:39.240 --> 33:40.760
Even though I'm a slave...

33:41.560 --> 33:43.680
I can't stand such humiliation
!

33:48.760 --> 33:50.480
Selir Linglong.

33:57.240 --> 33:58.400
Selir Linglong!

34:01.320 --> 34:02.840
Selir Linglong!

34:08.360 --> 34:09.520
so...

34:10.120 --> 34:11.120
Hua Chen...

34:11.760 --> 34:13.080
What makes you confident?

34:13.160 --> 34:15.400
Hua Shen is innocent?

34:17.120 --> 34:18.640
Insignificant servant...

34:18.720 --> 34:20.080
The person who died in Hwataek...

34:20.760 --> 34:23.600
The person I consider my older brother.

34:24.920 --> 34:26.480
- I...
- What?

34:27.240 --> 34:28.360
What do you want to say?

34:29.280 --> 34:30.280
Hua Chen.

34:31.280 --> 34:33.600
I'm giving you a chance.
I'm giving you time.

34:33.680 --> 34:35.080
But what do you do?

34:36.280 --> 34:37.400
As you know...

34:37.880 --> 34:40.040
Linglong and I are very close.

34:40.720 --> 34:44.440
Do you think you made up for it?

34:44.520 --> 34:46.080
By making me Jong Ye-ran's concubine?

34:46.520 --> 34:49.280
I didn't know that the maid was Linglong
...

34:49.360 --> 34:50.640
I also
ask your Excellency...

34:50.720 --> 34:53.920
Do you consider yourself an ordinary servant?

34:55.200 --> 34:56.400
So please be quiet...

34:56.480 --> 34:58.320
And will you hand over Hua Shen to your father?

34:59.240 --> 35:01.560
You know Steward Hu
will protect him...

35:01.640 --> 35:02.960
But you're still doing that.

35:03.440 --> 35:05.440
The reason is in your eyes...

35:05.760 --> 35:11.880
The life of an anonymous server
is very precious.

35:14.520 --> 35:17.040
You said you'd never hurt me again...

35:18.520 --> 35:20.840
And I almost believed you.

35:20.920 --> 35:21.920
I want to believe it...

35:22.000 --> 35:24.920
You may not be involved in our family's affairs.

35:27.360 --> 35:29.560
But
what happened to Linglong...

35:30.800 --> 35:34.760
I realized I will never forgive you
.

35:35.440 --> 35:37.760
Many people are having difficulties...

35:37.840 --> 35:39.400
In the hands of the Hua family...

35:39.480 --> 35:40.880
And it doesn't come true.

35:41.480 --> 35:44.440
You are part of the Hua family.

35:44.720 --> 35:47.840
It makes you
indifferent and selfish.

35:47.920 --> 35:49.080
You can pretend not to know...

35:49.160 --> 35:50.160
Because I didn't see it...

35:50.240 --> 35:52.920
But I can't.

35:55.520 --> 36:00.080
So you framed him?

36:02.000 --> 36:03.440
To avenge Linglong?

36:06.200 --> 36:07.800
Because you didn't punish him...

36:08.480 --> 36:10.880
I made sure he
got his reward.

36:11.600 --> 36:14.280
You are not interested in the lives of your servants.

36:15.360 --> 36:18.080
What about me,
Concubine Jong Ye?

36:19.480 --> 36:22.400
Could it cost him a fortune?

36:25.560 --> 36:27.080
By doing this?

36:28.560 --> 36:29.920
Do you take advantage of a man who loves you?

36:36.400 --> 36:37.960
Why can't I do that?

36:38.920 --> 36:41.360
That means we must accept all evil
...

36:41.440 --> 36:42.440
What the Hwa family did...

36:42.520 --> 36:44.480
Without a fight?

36:45.640 --> 36:47.080
For me...

36:48.160 --> 36:50.400
As long as you're against family...

36:50.640 --> 36:54.440
It is merely a means to an end.

37:00.160 --> 37:01.160
great.

37:02.160 --> 37:03.200
I understand.

37:15.440 --> 37:16.560
ma'am.

37:18.680 --> 37:20.200
Madam, what's going on?

37:20.480 --> 37:21.480
am...

37:26.600 --> 37:27.800
What are you doing here?

37:31.120 --> 37:32.400
From now on, without my permission...

37:32.480 --> 37:33.960
You cannot enter Yao 's house .

37:38.760 --> 37:42.600
If Muda Muda doesn't stop you that day ...

37:43.200 --> 37:46.120
Will your sword cut me down?

37:53.800 --> 37:55.440
It's true, right?

37:59.720 --> 38:00.720
Jong Ye-ran.

38:02.160 --> 38:05.080
Are jade pendants that important?

38:06.480 --> 38:07.760
Does it really matter who that person is?

38:07.840 --> 38:10.160
Who is standing with you in the temple?

38:10.240 --> 38:11.640
When you were young?

38:13.560 --> 38:15.400
Are romantic feelings possible
?

38:15.640 --> 38:16.640
Just remembering someone
...

38:16.720 --> 38:17.960
The person you gave the jade pendant to?

38:18.680 --> 38:20.800
Why am I saying this now?

38:25.000 --> 38:26.440
Just curious...

38:27.760 --> 38:29.920
Is it true that he is a liar?

38:30.800 --> 38:32.800
You can't gain someone else's trust...

38:33.640 --> 38:37.600
And improve the situation.

38:40.600 --> 38:42.560
Even if you sacrifice your life...

38:44.680 --> 38:46.960
I didn't even have time to defend myself...

38:47.680 --> 38:50.200
When you draw a sword on me
.

38:51.520 --> 38:53.520
Am I showing weakness...

38:54.640 --> 38:57.280
Are you trying to manipulate me
into freeing Hua Shen?

39:08.480 --> 39:10.360
great...

39:11.200 --> 39:12.320
If you think that way about me too.

39:54.320 --> 39:55.320
ma'am.

40:13.440 --> 40:15.080
<i>Dia menyukai Qianzhi.</i>

40:38.800 --> 40:41.560
What are you going to do with Hua Shen?

40:48.160 --> 40:49.360
I leave it to you.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.120
Tuan.

41:02.400 --> 41:04.520
King Hakim's men
have not left yet.

41:04.600 --> 41:06.120
What should I say to them this time?

41:17.560 --> 41:18.840
Find the reason and kick them out.

41:20.040 --> 41:21.040
All right.

41:42.840 --> 41:44.840
<i>Adigan Bonus</i>

41:54.840 --> 41:57.160
Internal damage appears to be serious.

41:58.120 --> 41:59.880
Why do I only want Jindao powder?

42:00.120 --> 42:02.000
I'll check it.

42:02.080 --> 42:04.480
Don't bother.
Just give me Jindao powder.

42:04.560 --> 42:05.560
hurry up, please.

42:05.640 --> 42:07.680
But,
you don't seem to experience...

42:07.760 --> 42:08.960
external wounds.

42:09.480 --> 42:11.920
Jindao powder is only good for external wounds.

42:12.320 --> 42:13.320
Haven't found it yet?

42:13.800 --> 42:15.000
I am looking for it.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.640
this. Where is the pain?

42:19.720 --> 42:21.000
We will treat your wounds.

42:21.960 --> 42:23.520
Why are you in a hurry?

42:23.600 --> 42:25.200
Doctor, do you have Jindao powder?

42:26.000 --> 42:28.800
What happen?
Who got hurt?

42:29.080 --> 42:30.640
Why does everyone
want Jin Dao powder?

42:31.800 --> 42:33.360
please give it to me
This is an emergency situation.
