<i>Episode 20</i>

01:42.400 --> 01:43.600
Lady, be careful.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.000
Sure.

01:46.080 --> 01:50.840
Emotions disappear over time.

01:51.160 --> 01:52.360
Miss, what are you talking about?

01:54.840 --> 01:55.920
It's nothing.

01:56.040 --> 01:58.280
It seems like it suddenly got cold again.

02:00.520 --> 02:01.520
Mr. Hua, are you here?

02:01.600 --> 02:02.920
Are you going to look for your highness again?

02:03.720 --> 02:06.160
Has Mr. Chi also come to see His Majesty?

02:06.880 --> 02:09.680
No, I came to see you.

02:11.120 --> 02:12.160
Ah, that's right.

02:12.760 --> 02:15.000
I will call you Miss Hua now.

02:15.320 --> 02:17.360
-You are divorced. -to let go!

02:17.440 --> 02:18.880
Miss Qi, be careful what you say!

02:18.960 --> 02:20.000
to let go...

02:24.480 --> 02:26.320
Why do you look at me like that?

02:26.720 --> 02:28.680
You have been lucky all your life.

02:28.760 --> 02:30.320
Even if divorced

02:30.400 --> 02:32.240
There is no need to be too sad.

02:32.320 --> 02:33.360
there are many people

02:33.440 --> 02:34.520
Someone who is in a worse situation than you.

02:35.720 --> 02:38.400
Qi Ruxin, how did I offend you?

02:38.720 --> 02:40.720
Life has been very easy so far.

02:41.400 --> 02:43.240
So I hate you to the core.

02:45.760 --> 02:46.760
however

02:47.240 --> 02:49.240
I heard that your brother died.

02:50.160 --> 02:52.560
-to let go! —Heaven is fair in the end.

02:55.880 --> 02:58.720
Please tell me one more thing about my sister.

02:59.080 --> 03:00.480
And I won't let you talk

03:00.560 --> 03:01.640
For the rest of your life.

03:01.720 --> 03:05.040
What, you think you can scare me?

03:05.240 --> 03:06.880
Teacher Hua, please forgive my teacher.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.640
assassins

03:08.720 --> 03:10.160
At the Mid-Autumn Festival banquet

03:10.240 --> 03:11.520
It put her in great fear.

03:11.760 --> 03:13.120
She is still in shock.

03:13.200 --> 03:16.360
Therefore, you cannot think straight.

03:16.640 --> 03:17.800
government.

03:20.960 --> 03:23.400
Fahrenheit, have you come to see Your Highness?

03:25.360 --> 03:26.480
to let go.

03:30.240 --> 03:31.240
yes.

03:31.320 --> 03:33.080
I just came out of the study room.

03:33.160 --> 03:34.800
And this is where I met you.

03:34.880 --> 03:37.440
I think we have a connection.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.160
If you think about it, you weren't like that.

03:39.240 --> 03:40.600
In the garden of bells for a long time.

03:40.920 --> 03:42.400
great.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.680
Fahrenheit, when you come to the bell garden again

03:45.760 --> 03:47.560
please come visit my house

03:47.640 --> 03:49.320
I have someone to talk to

03:49.560 --> 03:51.080
And don't feel so lonely

03:51.160 --> 03:52.640
I live here in Zhong's Garden.

03:53.760 --> 03:55.200
Aren't you kind!

04:01.280 --> 04:02.960
Sister Qi hasn’t been herself lately.

04:03.040 --> 04:04.960
She has been saying inappropriate things.

04:05.360 --> 04:07.680
If she offended you in any way Miss Hua

04:07.760 --> 04:09.120
I apologize on her behalf.

04:09.320 --> 04:11.600
I hope you don't take it to heart.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.080
I won't.

04:14.960 --> 04:17.080
I tend to speak my mind.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.560
some reasons

04:19.640 --> 04:21.000
It seemed like I liked you a lot

04:21.080 --> 04:22.440
The moment I first saw you.

04:23.440 --> 04:25.440
You returned to the Hua family.

04:25.520 --> 04:26.880
And I regained my freedom.

04:26.960 --> 04:28.440
I'm really happy.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.560
Now that I think about it, every time I see you

04:36.640 --> 04:38.480
It felt somehow familiar.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.680
Because the invitation has been extended

04:41.760 --> 04:43.880
Will I receive the glory?

04:43.960 --> 04:45.040
Do you want to go to your house today?

04:45.120 --> 04:46.320
I'm so happy!

04:50.280 --> 04:52.840
Miss Hua, we have never seen you.

04:52.920 --> 04:54.440
What have you been busy with?

04:54.520 --> 04:55.960
Nothing special. It was just like that.

04:56.040 --> 04:57.880
I'm looking for my brother's killer.

04:58.720 --> 05:01.120
Isn't this what Magistrate Wang should do?

05:01.200 --> 05:03.120
Teacher Hua, why are you intervening?

05:04.200 --> 05:05.400
prosecution investigation

05:05.480 --> 05:06.680
We are constrained by bureaucracy.

05:07.240 --> 05:10.080
It's faster to do your own research.

05:10.480 --> 05:13.920
Plus I'm a target for assassins

05:14.000 --> 05:16.240
So I won't let him go that easily.

05:16.880 --> 05:19.920
Mr. Hua, you are so brave and wise.

05:20.520 --> 05:21.880
<i>Why wasn't she surprised</i>

05:21.960 --> 05:24.040
<i>I was the target of an assassin?</i>

05:24.600 --> 05:26.160
<i>Does she know something?</i>

05:27.960 --> 05:30.000
—Mr. Meng... —Why are you two together?

05:33.400 --> 05:34.680
Where are you going?

05:35.920 --> 05:37.040
Lord.

05:37.440 --> 05:39.360
I just happened to meet Teacher Hua.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.440
we were having a good time

05:40.520 --> 05:41.520
So I invited her to my house

05:41.600 --> 05:42.600
Continue.

05:44.200 --> 05:46.480
In that case, please leave.

05:46.560 --> 05:48.840
I need to talk to Hua Qian.

05:49.080 --> 05:50.240
Yes, Lord.

05:58.080 --> 05:59.480
Of course, it was decided that way.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.760
Miss Meng will be your wife.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.120
I think he's polite

06:04.200 --> 06:05.400
And have good manners.

06:05.720 --> 06:07.480
Nothing has been decided.

06:07.560 --> 06:09.560
But why does it make that sound...

06:10.240 --> 06:11.560
Are you jealous?

06:13.840 --> 06:14.920
I heard you were here.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
I put down what I was doing

06:16.080 --> 06:17.120
And I came to see you.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.600
Why did you try to leave as soon as you saw me?

06:21.920 --> 06:23.880
Lord, if you want to see me

06:24.080 --> 06:25.440
Why didn't I see you?

06:25.520 --> 06:28.000
During the two hours I was with His Majesty?

06:28.480 --> 06:30.680
You showed up only after Meng Yifei and I showed up.

06:30.760 --> 06:33.680
We made plans to spend time together. why?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.720
What made you angry?

06:42.400 --> 06:43.760
I was rude.

06:43.840 --> 06:45.040
Forgive me, Lord.

06:45.120 --> 06:46.280
I'm going now.

06:49.560 --> 06:50.600
Kian.

06:53.320 --> 06:55.600
Recently, there have been a lot of things to take care of.

06:55.680 --> 06:56.760
I barely had time.

06:56.840 --> 06:58.160
I want to come and meet you today.

07:00.360 --> 07:03.560
I thought I made myself clear that day.

07:04.240 --> 07:05.680
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

07:05.760 --> 07:07.600
It doesn't hurt to wait a little longer.

07:07.760 --> 07:08.960
In the end you

07:09.040 --> 07:10.360
The daughter of the Hua family again.

07:11.840 --> 07:12.960
Lord.

07:13.280 --> 07:15.440
You tend to oversimplify problems.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.920
things between you and me

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
It transcends our emotions.

07:19.680 --> 07:22.880
Does this mean he is the lord of the Zhong family?

07:22.960 --> 07:24.360
Are your thoughts simple?

07:26.720 --> 07:28.520
You are interested in me too, right?

07:29.040 --> 07:31.480
i know. You tend to worry a lot.

07:32.840 --> 07:36.840
But what I said to you that day was sincere.

07:36.920 --> 07:38.880
You can come to me anytime.

07:39.080 --> 07:40.880
Like I said, it doesn't have to be that way.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.720
I gave orders from the Tower of Star Reach.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.000
Employees are involved in perfume making.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.160
It's on the first floor.

07:45.240 --> 07:47.000
No one is allowed on the 11th floor.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.920
It's exclusive to you.

07:50.320 --> 07:51.520
You can go there.

07:51.600 --> 07:52.920
Whenever I feel like it.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.920
You can enjoy it quietly and peacefully without being disturbed.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.400
When you are there.

08:08.680 --> 08:09.720
Thank you, but I'll decline.

08:10.840 --> 08:12.040
It's on a high floor

08:12.360 --> 08:13.520
I'm too tired to climb stairs.

08:14.560 --> 08:15.800
I don't want to go there again.

08:39.280 --> 08:40.840
Look what the cat dragged in.

08:40.920 --> 08:42.680
Lord, you rarely come here.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.400
Was there a conflict with Fahrenheit?

08:49.920 --> 08:52.000
Butler Hua's daughter today?

08:52.280 --> 08:54.240
Lord, have you come to ask about this?

08:54.320 --> 08:55.880
The Hua family’s son has just passed away.

08:55.960 --> 08:56.960
So Hua Qian is now

08:57.040 --> 08:58.920
Butler Hua's only daughter.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.200
No matter what conflict you experienced

09:04.560 --> 09:06.680
I hope you can give in to her.

09:06.760 --> 09:08.520
You want to protect Hua Qian.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.720
Why bother looking for excuses?

09:11.960 --> 09:12.960
What did you say?

09:14.640 --> 09:16.160
Judging by appearance

09:16.800 --> 09:18.440
you probably won't get what you want

09:18.520 --> 09:20.120
like me.

09:21.760 --> 09:24.000
I guess I'm not the only one.

09:24.080 --> 09:25.120
Feeling miserable.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.400
What do you know?

09:27.880 --> 09:30.880
i know what i need to know

09:31.080 --> 09:32.480
And what I shouldn't know.

09:37.240 --> 09:41.080
why? Lord, will you silence me?

09:41.520 --> 09:42.840
Lord, please forgive her.

09:42.920 --> 09:44.920
The young lady was scared and scared.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.280
At the Mid-Autumn Festival banquet

09:46.440 --> 09:48.200
Therefore, she cannot think straight.

09:58.360 --> 10:00.080
watch her

10:00.640 --> 10:02.120
And make sure she keeps her mouth shut.

10:03.600 --> 10:04.880
I have better things to do

10:04.960 --> 10:06.840
Rather than gossiping about people

10:07.120 --> 10:09.560
It's funny not getting what you want.

10:09.640 --> 10:12.120
Please let me experience this pleasure alone.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.240
to let go!

10:15.520 --> 10:17.480
Jong Si-woo...

10:17.720 --> 10:19.720
You can also become the lord of the Zong family

10:19.920 --> 10:22.400
But you are just as pathetic as me

10:22.560 --> 10:25.080
Because you can't get the woman you want.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.400
I am different from you.

10:34.320 --> 10:35.320
Chen Yuan.

10:38.640 --> 10:39.640
Lord.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.320
Send someone to watch over her.

10:41.400 --> 10:42.400
famous.

10:51.360 --> 10:53.560
Concubine Mu, I am your new maid Bansha.

10:53.640 --> 10:55.240
The housekeeper sent it.

10:55.680 --> 10:57.160
Is Jisoo not coming back?

10:57.480 --> 10:59.000
The housekeeper said she couldn't contact Jisoo.

10:59.080 --> 11:00.960
A person who returns to visit his hometown.

11:01.040 --> 11:02.760
He was afraid that you would not have enough maids.

11:02.840 --> 11:04.280
So you sent me here to serve you.

11:04.360 --> 11:05.880
He'll keep sending people

11:05.960 --> 11:07.480
To find the index.

11:08.080 --> 11:09.240
all right.

11:35.840 --> 11:38.120
Mr. Hwang said he had news.

11:39.400 --> 11:42.000
Teacher Hua, our men just sent news.

11:42.080 --> 11:43.080
They saw a man dressed in black

11:43.160 --> 11:45.280
Sneaking out of the servant's residence.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.520
Have you found the man's whereabouts?

12:00.720 --> 12:02.200
Yeah, that figure is gone.

12:02.280 --> 12:03.640
To a room on the second floor of the inn.

12:03.720 --> 12:04.720
in?

12:04.840 --> 12:06.720
It's an inconspicuous inn.

12:06.800 --> 12:09.000
A place where all kinds of people stay.

12:09.080 --> 12:10.240
after that?

12:10.320 --> 12:11.880
The guards following him were cautious.

12:11.960 --> 12:13.400
And I didn't confront that person.

12:13.480 --> 12:14.680
Instead they...

12:15.160 --> 12:17.720
<i>All Around Inn</i>

12:23.600 --> 12:25.680
Sir, here is some wine. Enjoy!

12:26.960 --> 12:28.720
—Hello, innkeeper! -teacher.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.720
Are there any empty rooms?

12:30.800 --> 12:32.640
for a moment. I'll check it.

12:37.440 --> 12:38.600
There is an empty room

12:38.680 --> 12:39.840
It's on both the first and second floors.

12:39.920 --> 12:41.760
Which floor do you prefer?

12:42.280 --> 12:43.840
I want the leftmost room on the second floor.

12:43.920 --> 12:45.480
Sir, what do you want?

12:45.560 --> 12:46.840
—A bottle of wine. -confident.

12:46.920 --> 12:49.200
Unfortunately, the room is already empty.

12:49.280 --> 12:50.960
When will the room be available?

12:51.040 --> 12:52.600
I am used to staying in that room.

12:52.680 --> 12:54.800
The guest in that room will leave tomorrow.

12:54.880 --> 12:57.720
How about taking it to the room next door?

12:57.800 --> 12:59.640
Can you get them to swap rooms with me?

12:59.720 --> 13:01.200
I just want to stay in that room.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.800
This doesn't seem appropriate.

13:02.960 --> 13:04.280
Those two guests were staying in that room.

13:04.360 --> 13:05.840
for a few days.

13:06.360 --> 13:07.600
Why did they stay so long?

13:07.680 --> 13:09.800
Are you merchants?

13:10.200 --> 13:11.720
I do not know.

13:12.040 --> 13:14.320
Probably tourists from somewhere.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.000
Because they have been inquiring

13:16.080 --> 13:17.360
Donghuang Mountain in the past few days.

13:17.560 --> 13:19.840
OK. You know what to do.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.160
all right!

13:21.800 --> 13:23.040
Donghuang Mountain?

13:31.200 --> 13:32.760
i was born again

13:33.160 --> 13:35.960
But his escape route remains the same.

13:37.320 --> 13:38.760
Are you sure about tomorrow?

13:38.840 --> 13:40.920
Has our guard been found?

13:41.000 --> 13:43.760
Obtaining this information was not easy.

13:43.840 --> 13:44.840
What does the other person think?

13:44.920 --> 13:46.800
Did they intentionally leak this information to us?

13:47.040 --> 13:48.200
I don't think so.

13:48.280 --> 13:49.400
But just in case

13:49.480 --> 13:50.560
Guards chasing the man in black

13:50.640 --> 13:51.800
We broke up on purpose.

13:51.880 --> 13:53.960
One person went to the counter to make an inquiry.

13:54.040 --> 13:55.560
while the other one sits in the lobby

13:55.640 --> 13:56.720
And I pretended to be a guest.

13:56.800 --> 13:57.880
To observe the surroundings.

13:57.960 --> 13:59.880
Nothing seemed normal

13:59.960 --> 14:02.000
So I don't think it's a trap.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.200
The man in black was careless

14:03.280 --> 14:04.960
And didn't realize he was being followed.

14:05.680 --> 14:06.800
imprudent?

14:09.160 --> 14:10.520
Is it really that simple?

14:13.280 --> 14:14.280
are you okay.

14:14.360 --> 14:15.840
I think it would be better not to miss the opportunity.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.880
Worst case scenario, I'll wait there every day.

14:17.960 --> 14:19.880
Now, go get some more men.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.440
And take as many people with you as possible.

14:21.520 --> 14:23.360
And he placed an ambush at the foot of the mountain.

14:23.640 --> 14:25.680
Move in batches.

14:25.760 --> 14:27.480
Remember to keep a low profile.

14:27.560 --> 14:29.280
Be discreet when you go there.

14:29.360 --> 14:30.480
I will go there tomorrow.

14:31.320 --> 14:32.320
I took note, Miss.

14:53.920 --> 14:55.040
Have you prepared the carriage?

14:58.760 --> 14:59.760
Let's hurry.

15:01.320 --> 15:02.320
Get it.

15:21.240 --> 15:23.480
Miss Hua, we are doing exciting things.

15:23.560 --> 15:24.760
i am afraid

15:25.080 --> 15:27.760
It will get the attention of soldiers.

15:28.240 --> 15:29.760
This is my intention.

15:30.120 --> 15:33.800
Then the mastermind will be revealed.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.200
well...

15:38.440 --> 15:39.480
are you okay.

15:39.720 --> 15:41.640
He won't dare ask for help

15:41.720 --> 15:43.160
When martial law was imposed on the city.

16:19.960 --> 16:21.000
Teacher, don't worry about me.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.080
Just run!

16:23.760 --> 16:25.040
Do your worst, Hua Qian.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.880
Are you seriously planning to kill me?

16:28.120 --> 16:29.600
Do you think you can escape punishment?

16:29.680 --> 16:30.960
After killing me?

16:32.920 --> 16:34.160
You are just an escaped slave.

16:34.240 --> 16:35.520
So what if I kill you?

16:35.720 --> 16:37.080
Don't play games with me.

16:37.640 --> 16:39.240
You clearly know who I am.

16:39.920 --> 16:41.960
me too? Then who are you?

16:45.000 --> 16:46.840
I have the courage to arrest you

16:46.920 --> 16:48.400
But do you dare ask for help?

16:48.960 --> 16:50.480
I'll leave it to you to decide if you want

16:51.080 --> 16:53.480
I admit that I have caused harm to the Hua family.

16:56.800 --> 16:59.440
If you surrender now

16:59.600 --> 17:01.480
I'll tell the guards to stop.

17:01.760 --> 17:03.520
And we can have a discussion.

17:03.920 --> 17:06.560
Otherwise we will fight until you die.

17:09.160 --> 17:10.200
master...

17:11.400 --> 17:12.400
don't do it

17:50.960 --> 17:54.360
It’s been a long time, junior Woo.

17:59.240 --> 18:00.800
How did you know I would come here?

18:00.880 --> 18:02.640
You told me that too.

18:02.720 --> 18:03.720
nonsense!

18:06.480 --> 18:09.640
I'm leaving Hwangcheong tomorrow.

18:09.720 --> 18:10.800
Via Donghuang Mountain pass.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.720
Please go and expose me as quickly as possible.

18:12.800 --> 18:18.160
Let's see who will believe a fugitive like you.

18:19.960 --> 18:21.240
your dull heart

18:21.320 --> 18:22.320
You won't be able to figure this out.

18:25.080 --> 18:26.840
Throw it in the carriage behind me

18:26.920 --> 18:27.920
And take it back.

18:31.280 --> 18:32.760
Go tomorrow and spread the word.

18:32.960 --> 18:34.240
I want everyone in Huangcheng

18:34.320 --> 18:35.600
To hear about this.

18:35.920 --> 18:37.200
The Hua family has put in a lot of effort.

18:37.280 --> 18:38.600
And got caught...

18:39.160 --> 18:40.280
escaped slave.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.120
I took note, Miss.

18:57.280 --> 18:58.640
How dare you arrest me!

18:59.520 --> 19:00.520
Aren’t you afraid of being in danger?

19:00.600 --> 19:01.920
long term cooperation

19:02.000 --> 19:03.640
Between the Zhong family and the Wu family?

19:03.880 --> 19:05.040
Why didn't you say this?

19:05.120 --> 19:07.400
When you get arrested?

19:10.640 --> 19:13.000
King Wu appears in Huangcheng.

19:13.080 --> 19:14.480
uninvited

19:14.560 --> 19:16.200
Even though the study tour is over.

19:16.560 --> 19:18.480
If your identity is exposed

19:18.560 --> 19:21.800
Then won't the Wu family's conspiracy be revealed?

19:21.880 --> 19:23.520
Stealing a perfume formula?

19:24.560 --> 19:26.240
when that happens

19:26.320 --> 19:28.440
Will there still be collaborations?

19:28.520 --> 19:29.720
Between the Zhong family and the Wu family?

19:29.800 --> 19:30.800
Who said I wanted to steal?

19:30.880 --> 19:31.880
Perfume formula?

19:33.640 --> 19:34.760
I'm just...

19:36.080 --> 19:37.960
We stayed in Huangcheng for a few more days.

19:38.640 --> 19:39.800
Is that true?

19:40.360 --> 19:42.120
Then explain why you need it.

19:42.200 --> 19:44.360
Lie down in Hwangseong (黃成).

19:45.640 --> 19:49.480
Or should I hand you over to the magistrate?

19:49.560 --> 19:50.560
For investigation?

19:51.000 --> 19:52.120
Hua Chen.

19:53.240 --> 19:55.400
I had no idea how ruthless you could be.

19:55.480 --> 19:56.600
Am I ruthless?

19:56.920 --> 19:58.400
You committed a banquet massacre.

19:58.480 --> 20:00.200
Did you expect no one to retaliate?

20:04.520 --> 20:05.720
how did you know?

20:26.360 --> 20:29.040
This wound appears to be almost completely healed.

20:29.640 --> 20:32.560
Why don't you explain how you got hurt?

20:36.120 --> 20:37.880
I think it's someone I fought with

20:38.240 --> 20:40.400
You were the magician of the valley.

20:43.120 --> 20:44.600
I asked how you knew that.

20:45.960 --> 20:47.560
How did I know about it?

20:48.200 --> 20:52.800
I would say you have given up on yourself.

20:53.640 --> 20:54.760
What does it mean?

20:54.840 --> 20:56.280
If it weren't for someone I knew

20:56.480 --> 20:57.920
That person probably didn't know that

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Hua Rongzhou was looking for me in the valley.

21:00.080 --> 21:01.640
And even told him which way to go.

21:05.920 --> 21:08.560
Or maybe I should say it like this

21:08.640 --> 21:10.320
Mu Yao betrayed you?

21:14.920 --> 21:16.360
I don't know what you're talking about.

21:18.160 --> 21:20.840
You are a dedicated person. It's really touching.

21:21.240 --> 21:22.840
I wonder if Muyao will move

21:22.920 --> 21:24.200
What if she knows?

21:25.520 --> 21:28.480
What gift do you think I should give her?

21:28.560 --> 21:30.160
So I can tell that that person is you?

21:31.800 --> 21:32.960
finger?

21:34.600 --> 21:35.680
eye?

21:38.400 --> 21:39.640
Or is it just one ear?

21:40.160 --> 21:41.600
You evil woman!

21:43.000 --> 21:44.680
Why not the tongue?

21:44.760 --> 21:47.040
Anyway, nothing good comes out of my mouth.

21:47.120 --> 21:48.600
Just take it from me.

21:49.040 --> 21:51.000
I am doing just that.

21:51.920 --> 21:54.960
What I want to cut off is your tongue

21:55.560 --> 21:58.560
And your fingers too.

21:59.280 --> 22:02.240
It's your eyes that I want to pierce through.

22:04.880 --> 22:06.680
Didn't we say we'd have a discussion?

22:06.760 --> 22:07.960
What if I surrender?

22:11.040 --> 22:13.360
Did you give me a chance to talk?

22:16.000 --> 22:19.600
The person who killed your brother was not one of my men.

22:19.680 --> 22:20.680
At the banquet.

22:23.040 --> 22:24.080
So who is it?

22:24.520 --> 22:25.520
I do not know either.

22:26.280 --> 22:27.880
Are you talking?

22:27.960 --> 22:29.600
Was there another group of assassins?

22:31.920 --> 22:32.920
yes.

22:36.200 --> 22:37.240
Why did you pretend to be from the Ge clan?

22:37.320 --> 22:38.960
To assassinate me?

22:42.920 --> 22:45.080
Because you know how I feel about you.

22:45.160 --> 22:46.640
do you trust me

22:48.160 --> 22:49.520
What do you believe you will do?

22:50.080 --> 22:51.080
I'll take you there.

22:53.600 --> 22:54.960
Why should I leave with you?

22:55.040 --> 22:56.920
Because you are the only person I love.

22:58.200 --> 23:01.280
So what? you like me

23:01.440 --> 23:02.840
Then do I have to go with you?

23:02.920 --> 23:03.920
Would you like to share?

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Is your husband with Hua Qian?

23:05.080 --> 23:06.080
shut up!

23:12.240 --> 23:14.120
Don't say you didn't notice

23:15.040 --> 23:16.640
Jong Ye-ran started it.

23:16.720 --> 23:18.360
He develops feelings for Hua Qian.

23:18.720 --> 23:21.040
He initially did not agree to divorce Hua Qian.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.200
'Cause he knew you would

23:22.280 --> 23:23.520
Take down Hua Qian.

23:23.600 --> 23:24.720
He wanted to take advantage of his position

23:24.800 --> 23:25.920
To protect Hua Qian

23:26.000 --> 23:27.320
From the involvement of the Hua family.

23:28.680 --> 23:29.680
Later he changed his mind.

23:29.760 --> 23:30.800
I agreed to divorce Hua Qian.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.520
It wasn't because of you

23:32.960 --> 23:34.000
But because Hua Qian insisted,

23:34.080 --> 23:35.120
divorce

23:35.600 --> 23:37.200
So he granted her wish.

23:42.360 --> 23:44.280
If you still have doubts

23:44.760 --> 23:46.080
How about we make a bet?

23:46.440 --> 23:48.280
Between you and Hua Qian

23:49.240 --> 23:50.720
Let's see who he will choose.

23:50.800 --> 23:51.920
OK.

23:54.400 --> 23:55.400
What should I do?

24:03.600 --> 24:05.480
I understand the reason without you having to say it.

24:05.560 --> 24:07.640
Anyway you're in my hands

24:07.920 --> 24:10.080
So let's see if Mu Yao will come looking for you.

24:10.160 --> 24:11.760
—Leave her alone! —Why should I?

24:13.320 --> 24:17.360
There is nothing between Mu Yao and me.

24:18.160 --> 24:19.920
What happens to me has nothing to do with her.

24:22.640 --> 24:23.840
When I see you.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.000
You are a junior lord

24:25.080 --> 24:26.240
One of the largest hub suppliers.

24:26.320 --> 24:28.280
you need to focus on your business

24:28.720 --> 24:31.000
Instead of doing something stupid.

24:31.080 --> 24:32.920
Because of you, the Wu family will decline.

24:34.520 --> 24:37.400
Besides, it doesn't matter what happened

24:37.480 --> 24:39.040
Between you two.

24:39.280 --> 24:41.680
Do you expect me to be moved by your devotion?

24:41.760 --> 24:43.520
And will you help me keep you two together?

24:45.640 --> 24:47.480
So you knew why.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.240
Is there any reason to ask again?

24:51.120 --> 24:52.560
So what if I knew?

24:53.240 --> 24:55.800
If you ask her, there will be room for negotiation.

24:58.600 --> 24:59.800
however

24:59.880 --> 25:01.680
Throw out the other man.

25:01.880 --> 25:04.080
We won't waste any medication on him.

25:04.160 --> 25:05.280
He's not worth it.

25:06.360 --> 25:08.200
You are truly a changed person.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.600
No wonder she sensed danger.

25:25.920 --> 25:28.040
I shouldn't have made that bet.

25:29.040 --> 25:32.920
I could never win.

25:41.400 --> 25:43.400
men! An intruder has appeared at Hua Residence!

25:50.080 --> 25:51.840
Go there! go!

25:53.840 --> 25:55.280
-Have you seen him? -no.

25:55.360 --> 25:57.160
Let's go over there. hurry!

26:15.080 --> 26:17.880
Last night, someone broke into Hua Residence.

26:17.960 --> 26:19.840
Teacher Hua, are you okay here?

26:19.920 --> 26:21.120
Did you catch him?

26:22.160 --> 26:23.160
no.

26:23.720 --> 26:24.840
what?

26:25.520 --> 26:27.400
The guards in this house are useless.

26:27.480 --> 26:29.920
They couldn't even catch random intruders.

26:34.400 --> 26:35.400
How about this?

26:35.480 --> 26:39.080
Go tell your dad I'm anxious

26:39.160 --> 26:40.720
Because of the intruder

26:40.800 --> 26:41.960
And I don't think I can sleep well

26:42.040 --> 26:43.200
A few days later.

26:43.280 --> 26:44.760
So let's borrow some guards.

26:44.840 --> 26:46.360
From Magistrate King

26:46.440 --> 26:49.360
About a month and a half.

26:52.200 --> 26:54.400
famous. I will inform Butler Hua immediately.

27:06.400 --> 27:08.160
Your injuries healed in time

27:08.240 --> 27:10.000
And you could help with that.

27:10.440 --> 27:11.480
Rest assured, lady.

27:11.560 --> 27:13.360
No one knows what happened last night.

27:13.600 --> 27:15.000
I have no doubts about your agility.

27:18.440 --> 27:19.520
Magistrate King's bodyguards

27:19.600 --> 27:20.680
It belongs to the government.

27:20.760 --> 27:22.160
Even if you have no skills

27:22.240 --> 27:24.360
They are not just security guards at Hua Residence.

27:24.640 --> 27:28.240
Who wants to spy on Hua Residence?

27:28.400 --> 27:30.280
You'll think twice.

27:34.160 --> 27:37.240
You look pretty in this color.

27:48.360 --> 27:50.400
Thank you for coming.

27:50.480 --> 27:51.720
Mr. Hwang, there is no need to be so polite.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.120
Please come this way.

27:56.120 --> 27:58.360
<i>Jong Residence</i>

28:08.840 --> 28:09.880
Is there anyone there?

28:18.120 --> 28:19.840
I let you go.

28:19.920 --> 28:21.160
Why did you come back?

28:21.320 --> 28:24.320
Concubine Mu Huacheon has captured my master.

28:27.880 --> 28:29.160
Are you an escaped slave?

28:29.240 --> 28:30.720
That person claimed he caught them?

28:30.800 --> 28:31.800
yes.

28:31.880 --> 28:33.000
Guard Cang escaped.

28:33.080 --> 28:34.200
He sent us information

28:34.680 --> 28:36.080
So we're confident that's true.

28:36.520 --> 28:38.040
Your master’s whereabouts were a secret.

28:38.120 --> 28:39.800
Even I didn't know.

28:39.880 --> 28:41.560
How did Hua Qian know?

28:42.360 --> 28:43.760
We don't know either.

28:46.960 --> 28:49.160
Why did you come to see me today?

28:49.240 --> 28:50.280
Hua Residence is currently

28:50.360 --> 28:51.400
Bodyguards are watching.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.480
If we come to save him

28:53.560 --> 28:55.080
We can also warn them.

28:55.880 --> 28:56.880
so?

28:58.080 --> 28:59.400
Master told us repeatedly

28:59.480 --> 29:01.200
so as not to disturb you

29:01.360 --> 29:03.160
But the problem is urgent.

29:03.480 --> 29:05.760
Mu-cheop, please save our master.

29:12.280 --> 29:14.360
I have brought it to your master.

29:15.400 --> 29:16.400
are you okay.

29:17.520 --> 29:18.880
I won't corner him.

29:20.920 --> 29:22.080
Go back now.

29:23.560 --> 29:25.040
Trust me...

29:25.880 --> 29:28.240
Bring your master to you in one piece.

29:29.560 --> 29:31.920
Thank you, Muchup!

29:51.760 --> 29:53.360
Muyao...

29:55.600 --> 29:58.680
What caused you to become someone you despise?

30:07.960 --> 30:08.960
to let go.

30:09.160 --> 30:10.480
Magistrate Wang's guards are here.

30:10.560 --> 30:11.880
For almost a week.

30:11.960 --> 30:14.280
And it was quite peaceful here.

30:14.360 --> 30:15.360
I heard it from Mr. Hwang.

30:15.440 --> 30:17.160
They were talking about leaving.

30:19.120 --> 30:20.880
This is unexpected.

30:21.160 --> 30:23.600
It was amazing how patient they were.

30:24.320 --> 30:27.120
Miss, have you figured out what to do next?

30:38.280 --> 30:39.280
to let go.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.480
Miss Meng sent another invitation.

30:41.560 --> 30:42.600
<i>Meng Yi Fei</i>

30:42.680 --> 30:44.600
Miss, are you still going?

30:44.680 --> 30:46.080
You're refusing that person's invitation?

30:51.360 --> 30:52.880
Anyway, I have nothing to do.

30:52.960 --> 30:54.240
Let's go out for a walk.

31:01.320 --> 31:02.400
Mr. Hua, please take a seat.

31:08.920 --> 31:10.040
Come and try this tea.

31:10.320 --> 31:11.320
This is Dragon Musk Tea.

31:11.400 --> 31:14.160
My father brought it from the south for me.

31:14.520 --> 31:15.680
I'm thankful that he thought of me.

31:15.760 --> 31:16.920
Despite being immersed in work.

31:17.440 --> 31:20.480
I don't offer it to just anyone.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.640
I am so lucky.

31:27.440 --> 31:30.240
After you left the servant's garden that day

31:30.320 --> 31:32.400
I hoped we could talk again.

31:32.640 --> 31:33.640
Unfortunately, you keep rejecting my invitations.

31:33.720 --> 31:34.720
He said he was busy.

31:35.600 --> 31:38.120
Today, my wish finally came true.

31:38.320 --> 31:40.040
I'm sorry, Mr. Meng.

31:40.120 --> 31:42.760
I've been a bit busy lately.

31:42.840 --> 31:43.920
really?

31:44.000 --> 31:46.480
I thought it was an excuse.

31:46.720 --> 31:48.280
So, what's keeping you busy?

31:49.360 --> 31:50.520
Coincidentally

31:50.600 --> 31:52.760
I caught a fugitive a few days ago.

31:52.840 --> 31:54.680
When I was looking for an escaped slave.

31:54.760 --> 31:56.080
And it turns out the fugitive was involved

31:56.160 --> 31:57.320
In the banquet assassination case

31:57.400 --> 31:58.560
a few days ago.

31:59.920 --> 32:02.000
So I was busy.

32:02.080 --> 32:04.480
Trying to find out what he knows.

32:05.120 --> 32:06.520
great.

32:06.680 --> 32:07.920
I hope the murderer is punished.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.400
And get the punishment you deserve.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.800
I hope so too, Mr. Meng.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.400
You rarely come here.

32:13.480 --> 32:15.600
We should have a good time.

32:15.680 --> 32:18.120
People come and go to the Bell Garden

32:18.200 --> 32:19.880
But I rarely meet people like you

32:19.960 --> 32:21.240
People I can chat with.

32:22.720 --> 32:27.040
I thought you and Miss Qi were very close?

32:27.840 --> 32:30.920
These days, Mr. Chi seems to have become a different person.

32:31.400 --> 32:33.400
But she won't tell me what happened.

32:34.040 --> 32:35.960
That guy must have been hit hard.

32:36.040 --> 32:37.960
That's what got her in this state.

32:39.360 --> 32:42.360
Actually, Mr. Chi has a sharp tongue.

32:42.720 --> 32:45.920
And her words may be harsh

32:46.320 --> 32:49.280
But she means well.

32:49.800 --> 32:51.400
Sometimes she feels more guilty.

32:51.480 --> 32:52.960
towards someone

32:53.040 --> 32:55.160
Her words are even harsher.

32:56.440 --> 32:57.560
Feeling guilty?

32:58.960 --> 33:00.440
I was just citing an example.

33:04.040 --> 33:05.200
How about you?

33:05.720 --> 33:07.960
I don't know what's special about me

33:08.040 --> 33:10.400
Then you will think of me differently.

33:11.520 --> 33:15.080
I can see it clearly even if others can't.

33:16.080 --> 33:17.480
I felt you set yourself apart from the rest

33:17.560 --> 33:19.000
Since I first saw you.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.920
And you escaped assassination twice.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.320
After bad luck, good luck follows.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.160
My father is the butler of the head family.

33:29.240 --> 33:31.400
business in the south

33:31.920 --> 33:33.440
When your father was a butler

33:33.520 --> 33:34.520
From the Zhong family.

33:34.880 --> 33:37.320
If we can take care of each other in the future

33:37.920 --> 33:39.560
Then we are standing in the garden of servants

33:39.720 --> 33:42.320
It is strengthened.

33:44.560 --> 33:45.720
Teacher Meng, I don’t understand.

33:45.800 --> 33:46.960
What you are saying.

33:48.720 --> 33:50.960
You are a smart girl.

33:51.040 --> 33:53.120
Surely you understand what I am saying.

33:55.160 --> 33:56.480
The Lord has feelings for you.

33:56.560 --> 33:59.040
I know because I have been there too.

34:00.240 --> 34:02.600
There will be many opportunities

34:02.680 --> 34:03.840
A place where you and I can work together.

34:03.920 --> 34:06.400
Teacher Meng, don’t make fun of me.

34:06.480 --> 34:07.720
OK...

34:07.800 --> 34:09.440
I won't tease you any more.

34:09.520 --> 34:12.160
In any case, we have a long way to go before us.

34:15.720 --> 34:16.760
Let's have tea.

34:17.600 --> 34:18.600
great.

34:26.720 --> 34:29.040
Sis Hua, come here when you have time.

34:47.160 --> 34:49.760
It's dirty. Just throw it away.

34:50.040 --> 34:51.360
Yes, lady.

35:38.080 --> 35:41.000
Master, I saw where Concubine Wu was going.

35:41.080 --> 35:42.800
She seemed to be going to Hua Residence.

35:43.960 --> 35:45.880
Magistrate King's bodyguards

35:45.960 --> 35:47.120
It's still at Hua Residence.

35:47.200 --> 35:48.760
It would be unwise

35:48.840 --> 35:50.040
Concubine Mu will go there alone.

35:50.720 --> 35:52.000
with her agility

35:52.400 --> 35:54.200
Avoiding those guards isn't a problem.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.040
I think Concubine Wu will go there.

35:56.120 --> 35:59.560
To meet the mistress... I mean, Miss Hua.

35:59.720 --> 36:01.360
Master, are you really going to ignore me?

36:01.440 --> 36:02.680
Why should I care?

36:03.160 --> 36:05.000
It's between them.

36:05.080 --> 36:06.640
No one else should intervene.

36:06.720 --> 36:09.000
but...

36:14.120 --> 36:15.120
When Hua Qian left

36:15.200 --> 36:16.720
She only took her belongings.

36:17.440 --> 36:18.680
She didn't play zither or chess.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.040
The ink brush and inkstone I gave her.

36:21.360 --> 36:24.120
When you have time, send it to her.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Okay, Master.

36:27.680 --> 36:28.680
Consider it over.

36:35.240 --> 36:36.400
to let go...

36:36.880 --> 36:38.560
Was he embarrassed because I didn't take him?

36:38.640 --> 36:40.000
In the garden of bells?

36:44.120 --> 36:45.480
Go talk to the chef

36:45.560 --> 36:46.800
I'm going to make a few more dishes for dinner.

36:46.880 --> 36:48.040
We will eat together.

36:48.120 --> 36:49.120
Yes, lady.

36:53.360 --> 36:54.960
Teacher, Mu Yao is here.

37:28.720 --> 37:30.440
How did it feel to overcome the wall?

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
Where is he?

37:32.400 --> 37:33.520
WHO?

37:33.600 --> 37:34.840
don't do anything stupid to me

37:39.960 --> 37:41.320
Why are you in a hurry?

37:41.880 --> 37:43.280
you came here uninvited

37:43.720 --> 37:45.040
And I just got back.

37:45.240 --> 37:48.680
Can I drink some water and take a breather?

37:52.960 --> 37:54.160
You let his guards go on purpose.

37:54.240 --> 37:56.160
You wanted him to tell me, right?

37:56.240 --> 37:58.160
I don't have time to play games with you.

37:58.440 --> 38:00.640
I have come as you wish.

38:00.720 --> 38:02.640
Can you let him go now?

38:02.720 --> 38:04.560
How did that cup make you feel?

38:05.240 --> 38:06.760
Where did you pick it up?

38:06.840 --> 38:08.360
Bad habit of breaking cups?

38:08.640 --> 38:10.920
You have to give up your habits.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.280
Hua Chen!

38:15.640 --> 38:16.800
since you know that

38:16.880 --> 38:18.440
You came here to ask me for help.

38:18.520 --> 38:20.840
Shouldn't you be more polite?

38:24.080 --> 38:25.520
I am here now.

38:25.600 --> 38:27.400
Do whatever you want with me.

38:27.640 --> 38:30.000
Just send it to me. He has nothing to do with this.

38:32.480 --> 38:33.720
He has nothing to do with this?

38:34.480 --> 38:37.640
Mu Yao, your cheek

38:37.720 --> 38:38.840
To get that out there.

38:39.720 --> 38:42.640
Are you saying Wu Shuomo wasn't involved?

38:42.720 --> 38:44.320
At the banquet assassination?

38:44.840 --> 38:48.480
And the cliff kidnapping?

38:51.560 --> 38:53.920
I was the master

38:54.920 --> 38:56.800
And he was just a pawn.

38:58.680 --> 38:59.880
It's true.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.360
One person made some plans.

39:02.440 --> 39:03.840
Hoping to find the answer

39:03.920 --> 39:05.600
While the other waits at the foot of the cliff

39:05.680 --> 39:07.320
I believe you can win the heart of the person you love.

39:07.400 --> 39:10.320
How should I define you two?

39:10.400 --> 39:11.800
Is it funny or pathetic?

39:11.880 --> 39:13.920
—Why... —Next time

39:14.000 --> 39:15.880
Be sure to refine your acting.

39:16.120 --> 39:18.000
It's something that can't happen to someone.

39:18.080 --> 39:19.640
Shows no signs of shock or fear

39:19.720 --> 39:21.520
When you wake up and find yourself

39:21.600 --> 39:22.600
Hanging over the edge of a cliff.

39:27.200 --> 39:28.560
OK.

39:30.120 --> 39:32.800
If you want revenge, come to me.

39:34.520 --> 39:36.880
Aren't you faithful to each other?

39:36.960 --> 39:38.440
You're both competing for responsibility.

39:38.520 --> 39:40.040
To yourself.

39:40.720 --> 39:42.840
Why does it sound like that?

39:43.000 --> 39:45.840
Am I the villain this time too?

39:49.360 --> 39:51.920
Has Jong Ye-ran become insignificant?

39:52.000 --> 39:53.480
To you now?

39:53.560 --> 39:55.960
you took him from me

39:56.400 --> 39:57.560
And now you think I've let him down?

39:57.640 --> 39:58.640
Don't be a hypocrite.

39:58.720 --> 39:59.840
I took him from you?

40:00.760 --> 40:02.840
I have made you his concubine.

40:02.920 --> 40:04.200
And I took the initiative to get a divorce.

40:04.280 --> 40:06.160
What more do you want me to do?

40:06.760 --> 40:10.200
Mu Yao, I thought you were smart.

40:10.280 --> 40:12.520
How could you be so stupid?

40:15.920 --> 40:17.360
Yes, I was foolish enough to think

40:18.720 --> 40:21.200
I could say that about him.

40:21.760 --> 40:23.640
Haven't you tried it?

40:23.720 --> 40:24.880
To destroy everything I own?

40:26.040 --> 40:28.080
You succeeded.

40:28.720 --> 40:31.120
He's starting to develop feelings for you.

40:34.480 --> 40:37.560
How stupid I was

40:38.400 --> 40:40.200
I lost to you before.

40:40.280 --> 40:42.040
You are proud and selfish.

40:42.120 --> 40:43.120
It's better to suffer

40:43.200 --> 40:44.320
than lose your dignity

40:44.400 --> 40:45.760
You always blame others and blame yourself

40:45.840 --> 40:47.080
When things go wrong.

40:47.240 --> 40:51.000
Is Zhong Yeran the only person in this vast world?

40:51.080 --> 40:52.840
Can't you live without that person?

40:52.920 --> 40:54.640
What a small world you live in!

40:54.720 --> 40:56.200
Who are you to criticize me?

40:56.960 --> 40:58.720
Wasn't it the same for you?

41:17.360 --> 41:20.200
Master, I led the painter's guards there.

41:21.280 --> 41:22.280
good.

41:23.680 --> 41:25.560
What should I do next?

41:25.960 --> 41:27.440
naught.

41:29.320 --> 41:30.320
All right.
