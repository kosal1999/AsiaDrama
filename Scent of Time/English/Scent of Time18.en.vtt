01:35.280 --> 01:37.760
<i>Episode 17</i>

01:40.280 --> 01:41.600
Brother Juqing.

01:42.520 --> 01:44.120
I embroidered this myself.

01:44.960 --> 01:45.960
are you okay.

01:46.040 --> 01:47.560
Your Highness is no longer interested in me.

01:47.640 --> 01:48.680
Sooner or later she will allow me to leave.

01:48.760 --> 01:50.440
My father arranged a marriage for me.

02:05.360 --> 02:07.080
Please continue.

02:08.760 --> 02:10.360
And I wish you wealth

02:11.840 --> 02:12.880
And happiness.

02:15.360 --> 02:16.360
you...

02:18.680 --> 02:20.120
Are you getting married?

02:20.760 --> 02:22.560
Yes, next month.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.040
When you asked me to take you with me

02:44.240 --> 02:45.480
You said you didn't want to leave your family.

02:45.560 --> 02:46.840
And I was afraid.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.600
And now you have come to rub salt in my wounds.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.800
Nickname...

02:55.480 --> 02:57.600
Why did I fall in love with someone like you?

03:19.680 --> 03:20.880
Forget it.

03:21.320 --> 03:22.520
Forget it.

03:23.720 --> 03:25.960
I misjudged you.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.440
I wasn't lucky to have met you.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.800
You are in charge of delivery.

03:49.160 --> 03:50.360
This time with Hwangcheong.

03:52.280 --> 03:53.520
Is it true?

03:54.120 --> 03:55.400
yes

03:55.480 --> 03:57.640
But the purpose you are going for is

03:57.720 --> 03:59.880
Ruxin is making you completely forget about him.

04:01.400 --> 04:02.840
She is no longer young.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.880
One of her maids sent me a message.

04:05.480 --> 04:06.760
Saying that he still has feelings for you

04:06.840 --> 04:08.960
After all these years.

04:09.640 --> 04:10.800
this time

04:11.520 --> 04:12.880
you will go

04:12.960 --> 04:15.560
And make her forget about you completely.

04:18.560 --> 04:19.800
What if I don't want to do it?

04:22.400 --> 04:26.400
Then you will never see her again.

04:27.280 --> 04:28.400
Do not forget it

04:29.040 --> 04:30.920
you and your family

04:31.440 --> 04:33.280
You are my slave.

04:33.760 --> 04:35.640
Think of her.

04:36.960 --> 04:39.520
Between the servant's sons

04:40.280 --> 04:41.560
And the lord of the Zong family

04:41.920 --> 04:44.080
In Hwangcheong

04:44.560 --> 04:46.120
Who is the better choice?

04:46.200 --> 04:47.560
It's clear.

04:49.360 --> 04:52.360
do as i say

04:53.200 --> 04:57.000
Then I will return your contract to you

04:57.480 --> 04:59.200
So you and your family will be free.

05:00.240 --> 05:03.040
But if you insist on not doing that

05:04.160 --> 05:08.000
Ruxin is never seen again.

05:09.440 --> 05:12.760
You can take this chance

05:13.440 --> 05:14.440
To say goodbye to her.

05:50.640 --> 05:51.840
shake it

05:53.920 --> 05:55.320
I sincerely hope

05:56.600 --> 05:57.760
you will buy

05:59.720 --> 06:03.040
A life of wealth and glory.

06:04.360 --> 06:05.600
to let go...

06:06.240 --> 06:07.240
to let go...

06:07.320 --> 06:08.360
Lady, calm down.

06:09.560 --> 06:11.160
to let go...

06:11.240 --> 06:12.840
I agreed to come to the Bell Garden

06:13.440 --> 06:14.960
Because I didn't want my father to punish him.

06:15.040 --> 06:16.600
???Ass... ???But what did I get?

06:16.680 --> 06:19.440
???Miss... ???What did I get?

06:20.920 --> 06:22.040
to let go.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.840
Sir, Qin Lin is your servant.

06:24.920 --> 06:26.480
There is a better choice.

06:27.240 --> 06:29.240
I'm sure your father did the right thing.

06:30.040 --> 06:32.000
A better choice?

06:33.200 --> 06:34.720
What other options do I have?

06:34.800 --> 06:36.480
I suffered for so long

06:37.560 --> 06:39.520
And I got this result.

06:39.920 --> 06:41.200
???Tell me please. ???me...

06:41.680 --> 06:44.200
Why am I the only one who feels miserable?

06:44.560 --> 06:47.240
Calm down, girl...

06:47.560 --> 06:51.120
love is the most worthless thing

06:51.200 --> 06:52.680
oh my god.

06:53.800 --> 06:58.640
'Cause nothing goes right for me

07:00.120 --> 07:03.040
I will make others feel what I feel.

07:05.640 --> 07:06.800
Please take a seat, Second Aunt.

07:12.560 --> 07:14.200
Did your second aunt come alone?

07:14.840 --> 07:15.920
yes.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.320
We haven't seen each other for a long time

07:17.400 --> 07:18.680
And I heard you missed us

07:18.760 --> 07:20.360
So I came right here.

07:21.080 --> 07:24.080
The bell garden is wonderful.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.920
The quality of everything here is much better

07:26.000 --> 07:27.840
Than your uncle uses

07:28.360 --> 07:29.840
I thank Her Highness for her care.

07:30.920 --> 07:32.560
Your mother praised your brother

07:32.640 --> 07:34.520
Because she was wise when she was in the city.

07:34.600 --> 07:36.000
I think you are much wiser.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.480
Than her.

07:38.480 --> 07:40.320
She lives with my sister.

07:40.400 --> 07:41.400
What she thinks is right.

07:41.480 --> 07:42.480
My younger sister is more likable.

07:42.560 --> 07:43.760
you're welcome.

07:43.840 --> 07:45.520
How does your sister compare to you?

07:46.680 --> 07:48.840
You have spent a lot of time with His Highness.

07:49.320 --> 07:50.440
very likely

07:50.520 --> 07:51.680
You will be a member of the Jong family...

07:55.480 --> 07:57.600
Anyway, my family

07:58.040 --> 07:59.120
It will be up to you.

07:59.960 --> 08:02.360
How are my cousins ​​and uncles?

08:03.040 --> 08:04.120
I haven't seen them for a while

08:04.600 --> 08:06.800
And I miss them a little bit.

08:06.880 --> 08:09.560
are you okay. let me tell them

08:09.640 --> 08:12.160
I'm coming to see you.

08:12.240 --> 08:13.680
That's a really good idea.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.360
I have something to ask my uncle.

08:18.160 --> 08:20.880
As expected, my father contacts me often.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.960
Through him and letters.

08:23.600 --> 08:24.600
It's true.

08:25.920 --> 08:26.960
Have some tea, second aunt.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.160
OK.

08:34.800 --> 08:35.920
How have you been?

08:44.520 --> 08:45.760
can you tell?

08:46.400 --> 08:48.240
What scent is it today?

08:48.320 --> 08:49.600
It looks a little familiar to me

08:49.880 --> 08:51.360
But I can’t put my finger on it.

08:51.800 --> 08:53.200
Mother, be careful.

08:53.880 --> 08:55.160
It's a Chuseok scent.

08:55.920 --> 08:58.560
???Butler Whoa. ???You really are a deacon.

08:58.640 --> 09:00.760
I could tell even from afar.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.560
Come, baby.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.560
Mom, I will sit over there.

09:07.640 --> 09:09.360
???long time no see. ???of course.

09:10.320 --> 09:11.520
How is your business?

09:13.760 --> 09:15.640
???What happen? ???Please give it here.

09:17.680 --> 09:19.680
Let’s eat and be healthy, okay?

09:19.760 --> 09:20.920
Is he going to eat more?

09:21.520 --> 09:23.120
I can't even pass through this wide passage.

09:23.200 --> 09:24.200
Doesn't he know how fat he is?

09:24.280 --> 09:27.040
Quiet. Isn't he your son?

09:31.320 --> 09:32.360
OK.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.520
Chuseok incense is very expensive.

09:35.600 --> 09:38.120
Ordinary deacons like us can't afford that at all.

09:39.160 --> 09:41.560
I can only smell it from here.

09:41.640 --> 09:43.000
No wonder I didn't realize it.

09:43.080 --> 09:46.960
yes. Hua Residence has a lot to offer.

09:47.040 --> 09:48.720
So he was able to identify it.

09:49.080 --> 09:50.360
That's why people say this.

09:50.440 --> 09:51.720
The Hua family is the second

09:51.800 --> 09:52.960
Brings wealth to the Zhong family.

09:53.880 --> 09:55.480
There are also paintings and calligraphy.

09:55.560 --> 09:57.760
Could you rate it?

09:57.840 --> 09:59.000
I'm sure...

10:05.640 --> 10:06.800
Hello everyone.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.240
long time no see.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.840
father. mother.

10:36.160 --> 10:37.160
Kian...

10:41.040 --> 10:42.040
come...

10:46.160 --> 10:47.280
Kian.

10:47.960 --> 10:49.760
Princess Royal has arrived.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.400
Hello, Lord, Your Majesty.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Everyone please take your seats.

11:00.720 --> 11:02.400
Thank you, God.

11:07.520 --> 11:11.520
I hope everyone has a happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

11:12.120 --> 11:14.160
Thank you for your hard work last year.

11:17.120 --> 11:19.120
Let me propose a toast.

11:19.640 --> 11:23.280
Make yourself at home.

11:23.360 --> 11:25.200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

11:33.680 --> 11:35.200
???Please, teacher. ???I will help you.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.440
Qian, why are you sitting here?

11:59.880 --> 12:00.960
eat your food

12:01.400 --> 12:03.440
I just want to talk to you.

12:03.760 --> 12:05.440
I haven't seen you for a month.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.160
I think I lost weight again.

12:07.240 --> 12:09.280
Let's talk after the banquet is over.

12:10.320 --> 12:12.280
last time you were in my room

12:12.360 --> 12:13.520
You said you would come see me

12:13.600 --> 12:15.040
But you didn't.

12:16.560 --> 12:17.600
Thank you for your courage in raising this issue.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.200
Think about what you have done.

12:20.280 --> 12:21.360
And cause me less trouble

12:21.440 --> 12:22.840
You don't need to worry that much.

12:22.920 --> 12:25.400
III didn't spoil anything this time.

12:25.480 --> 12:27.760
what? Isn’t that how it should be?

12:27.840 --> 12:29.120
Do you want me to compliment you?

12:29.640 --> 12:31.920
One more word and I'll be done.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
OK.

12:36.440 --> 12:38.560
Qian, we are at a banquet.

12:38.640 --> 12:40.360
Could you be kinder to that person?

12:48.760 --> 12:50.000
A month has passed

12:50.080 --> 12:52.120
I'm still waiting for my father's reply.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.000
So now I want to ask you directly.

12:54.080 --> 12:55.240
Have you decided, Father?

12:56.560 --> 12:57.680
It wasn't easy for us

12:57.760 --> 12:58.920
To get to where we are today.

13:00.760 --> 13:03.200
Please don't mention this again.

13:11.640 --> 13:14.400
OK. I understand.

13:15.680 --> 13:18.480
Father, I did my best.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.760
Qian, I worry too much.

13:25.240 --> 13:27.480
Why don't you go home?

13:27.560 --> 13:29.040
And how many days off?

13:29.120 --> 13:30.160
It doesn't have to be that way.

13:33.840 --> 13:34.960
Where are you going?

13:35.280 --> 13:36.280
Kian!

13:40.080 --> 13:42.480
Who was she mad at?

14:04.080 --> 14:05.520
Are you leaving, Mr. Hua?

14:07.120 --> 14:08.200
Lord.

14:14.280 --> 14:15.280
A divorce letter is sent

14:15.360 --> 14:16.440
Later to your residence.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.120
???Divorce letter? ???yes.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.440
It has my stamp on it.

14:20.520 --> 14:22.000
Only then can you see the effect.

14:22.080 --> 14:23.120
Without signing your name.

14:25.720 --> 14:27.040
Thank you, God.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.120
I will go back and wait.

14:28.680 --> 14:29.680
Hua Chen...

14:45.520 --> 14:48.000
Lord, we are in the garden of servants.

14:48.080 --> 14:49.280
Many people pass through this place.

14:49.920 --> 14:52.400
No one knows about divorce yet.

14:52.480 --> 14:55.480
I don't want rumors to spread.

14:56.120 --> 14:58.640
This will also ruin your reputation.

14:59.200 --> 15:00.200
Who is he?

15:04.040 --> 15:05.640
He is Hua Rongzhou.

15:05.720 --> 15:06.800
A guard at the servant's residence.

15:06.880 --> 15:08.000
He is like a block of wood.

15:08.280 --> 15:10.320
He made you angry because he was worried.

15:10.400 --> 15:11.600
For my reputation.

15:12.720 --> 15:13.720
Is your last name angry?

15:17.040 --> 15:18.160
we share the same last name

15:18.240 --> 15:19.240
But we are not related.

15:23.080 --> 15:25.640
My father told me not to go too far.

15:25.960 --> 15:27.520
Lord, I'd better go back.

15:36.320 --> 15:37.960
Does that person look familiar to you?

15:39.000 --> 15:40.800
He is the mistress's personal guard.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.280
I've seen him several times before.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.600
I think I saw him from very far away.

15:50.960 --> 15:52.400
Call Lin Jiang to confirm his identity.

15:53.640 --> 15:54.640
Yes, Lord.

16:01.080 --> 16:02.440
I know you are old

16:02.520 --> 16:03.880
If you stand up quickly for justice

16:04.440 --> 16:05.880
But you need to consider who you are dealing with.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.840
If you insult the Lord

16:08.400 --> 16:10.400
I may not be able to save you either.

16:12.920 --> 16:14.280
The hostess, Guard Hua, said that.

16:14.360 --> 16:16.080
To protect your reputation.

16:16.160 --> 16:17.160
Finally, the news of divorce

16:17.240 --> 16:18.240
Nothing is known.

16:18.320 --> 16:19.640
If someone saw it

16:19.720 --> 16:21.720
Tongues will wag.

16:25.120 --> 16:26.120
i know.

16:59.560 --> 17:00.560
Here it is.

17:00.800 --> 17:02.320
OK. Let's drink together.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.560
Kill Jong Hee-woo to avenge our family!

17:12.040 --> 17:13.040
Protect us Lord!

17:14.560 --> 17:15.560
Siu!

17:24.120 --> 17:25.120
run!

17:28.640 --> 17:30.360
Let's go, girl! hurry!

17:31.080 --> 17:32.520
Let's go, girl!

17:32.840 --> 17:34.200
Let's go, Your Majesty!

17:34.520 --> 17:36.440
Let's go, Your Majesty!

17:49.000 --> 17:50.200
???Chen...Shen...! ???let's go!

17:50.280 --> 17:51.280
Kian, let's go!

17:56.280 --> 17:58.880
???Honey... ​​???Hurry! let's go!

17:58.960 --> 17:59.960
???hurry! ???Shen!

18:00.040 --> 18:02.800
mother...

18:06.120 --> 18:07.120

18:09.520 --> 18:11.120
???Go ahead and try it. ???What are you looking at?

18:11.200 --> 18:12.560
???go! ???hurry!

18:19.640 --> 18:21.560
???Halongzhou! ???go! fast!

18:21.640 --> 18:22.640
let's go!

18:24.240 --> 18:25.320
???Shen... ???Brother.

18:25.400 --> 18:26.400
wake up. fast!

18:28.640 --> 18:30.240
???father. ???Qian...

18:30.320 --> 18:31.520
???Qian! ???father!

18:32.800 --> 18:33.800
go.

19:06.240 --> 19:07.240
Go and protect Cuizhu.

19:19.800 --> 19:21.440
<i>Am I their target?</i>

19:27.280 --> 19:28.280
be careful!

19:30.880 --> 19:32.720
???My love... ???Shen!

19:33.080 --> 19:34.080
hurry.

19:50.360 --> 19:51.720
Kian!

20:14.880 --> 20:16.000
sibling!

20:19.760 --> 20:22.120
???Shen! ???Shen!

20:23.200 --> 20:24.240
sibling.

20:27.840 --> 20:29.360
Kian...

20:29.840 --> 20:32.160
Did it hurt this much?

20:32.920 --> 20:34.200
When hit by an arrow?

20:35.880 --> 20:37.760
Why did you take the hit for me?

20:43.000 --> 20:47.560
Qian, you also protect me from the Master.

20:47.640 --> 20:48.880
Didn't you?

20:50.720 --> 20:53.000
I am... I am your older brother.

20:53.360 --> 20:56.400
How can I stay still and do nothing?

20:57.520 --> 20:58.720
When I see you in danger?

21:01.520 --> 21:03.120
sibling...

21:05.960 --> 21:09.400
Kian, don't be afraid...

21:09.880 --> 21:11.800
I'm fine.

21:12.480 --> 21:13.960
I will protect you.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.200
I will protect you.

21:18.040 --> 21:20.760
I'm with you. Hurt...

21:20.840 --> 21:22.120
I'll take you home

21:22.200 --> 21:25.120
No, brother. It'll be okay.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.800
I'll take you...

21:32.520 --> 21:36.480
Kian...

21:38.040 --> 21:39.040
Kian!

21:43.160 --> 21:44.480
Kian!

21:47.280 --> 21:48.800
Kian...

21:51.920 --> 21:53.160
Kian...

22:11.080 --> 22:12.160
Lord.

22:12.240 --> 22:13.800
The reception hall was cleaned.

22:14.600 --> 22:15.600
Were the assassins caught?

22:15.880 --> 22:17.280
There were many women in the hall.

22:17.360 --> 22:18.760
The guards made it difficult to catch them.

22:18.840 --> 22:21.280
Most of the assassins fled.

22:21.360 --> 22:22.480
And some we caught

22:22.560 --> 22:24.200
He committed suicide by taking poison.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.600
They also took some girls with them

22:28.680 --> 22:30.400
I ran away like a hostage.

22:33.800 --> 22:34.800
Who are they?

22:35.360 --> 22:37.080
Butler Lee's eldest daughter

22:37.680 --> 22:38.840
Butler Wu's wife

22:39.240 --> 22:40.600
To the concubine...

22:42.520 --> 22:43.520
And the hostess.

22:45.560 --> 22:47.000
Magistrate Wang ordered the closure.

22:47.080 --> 22:48.280
And the Master is looking for them.

22:51.160 --> 22:54.120
Go and help the master.

22:54.200 --> 22:55.320
No, you can't, Lord.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.040
We are your personal security guards.

22:58.120 --> 22:59.920
We don't show up until we're needed.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.720
Otherwise we are like regular security guards.

23:01.800 --> 23:02.840
Saving comes first.

23:02.920 --> 23:04.200
???Lord! ???Yes, Lord.

23:18.120 --> 23:19.240
Let's go there. Go ahead and try it!

23:23.960 --> 23:24.960
There's nothing here, sir.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.040
???find. ???All right.

23:26.640 --> 23:27.640
Get out of the way.

23:28.720 --> 23:30.080
No suspicious individuals were found, Master.

23:30.160 --> 23:31.400
???Continue searching. ???All right.

23:32.360 --> 23:33.360
There's nothing here either, Master.

23:33.560 --> 23:34.880
???Continue searching. ???All right.

23:34.960 --> 23:36.400
???There’s nothing here either. ??? Please keep searching.

23:36.480 --> 23:37.520
All right.

23:38.160 --> 23:39.760
Master, there is no suspicious person nearby.

23:41.600 --> 23:43.000
Try a more thorough search.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.120
All right.

23:48.360 --> 23:50.120
Teacher, are you okay?

23:53.840 --> 23:55.600
<i>If you want to save Hwacheon and Muyao</i>

23:55.680 --> 23:57.480
<i>Come alone to the cliffs of Eastern Town</i>

24:01.760 --> 24:03.480
???Nanpung. ???I'm here.

24:03.840 --> 24:04.960
Continue your search with the men.

24:05.440 --> 24:06.960
Where are you going, teacher? I will go with you.

24:07.040 --> 24:08.920
no. Continue your search.

24:10.960 --> 24:12.400
???Continue searching. ???All right.

24:30.920 --> 24:31.920
Mu Yao.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.040
Mu Yao.

24:35.440 --> 24:36.520
Mu Yao.

24:37.280 --> 24:38.600
You finally woke up.

24:39.200 --> 24:40.720
who are you?

24:40.800 --> 24:41.880
What good would it do to tie me up?

24:41.960 --> 24:43.080
What if you want to kill me?

24:43.720 --> 24:45.560
It's not us who want to kill you.

24:59.720 --> 25:01.120
What do you want?

25:02.000 --> 25:03.360
Do you have a grudge against me?

25:03.840 --> 25:05.040
You will find out later.

25:06.280 --> 25:08.040
How is my brother?

25:16.640 --> 25:18.600
Mu Yao, it finally happened.

25:20.880 --> 25:23.440
Go ahead and try it. Can you become like a normal person?

25:23.520 --> 25:25.920
look down. It's a cliff!

25:32.760 --> 25:34.520
???Jong-ye-ran.???Stop it!

25:35.600 --> 25:37.000
Jong Ye-ran, how is my younger brother?

25:37.080 --> 25:38.520
What is Jong Ye like?

25:38.800 --> 25:40.200
You came really quickly.

25:40.680 --> 25:43.240
But you'd better step back.

25:43.800 --> 25:45.280
dare!

25:45.360 --> 25:46.800
Do you know who you kidnapped?

25:46.880 --> 25:49.320
We did it. Of course we know.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.320
I came alone.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.560
Tell me please. What do you want?

25:54.000 --> 25:56.040
Jongye-ran, please choose one.

25:57.680 --> 25:59.480
What nonsense are you talking about?

26:01.320 --> 26:02.480
What exactly do you want?

26:03.040 --> 26:04.480
We don't want anything.

26:04.960 --> 26:07.200
We just want to see you and your family suffer.

26:09.680 --> 26:10.800
Are you from the Ge family?

26:11.160 --> 26:13.960
huh. you destroyed my family

26:14.560 --> 26:15.840
So you will definitely taste it today

26:15.920 --> 26:17.320
Losing someone you love!

26:17.640 --> 26:18.640
Stop!

26:20.120 --> 26:22.040
You did it yourself.

26:22.680 --> 26:24.760
And if you want revenge

26:24.840 --> 26:26.760
Wouldn't it be easier to just kill Zong Yeran?

26:26.840 --> 26:27.880
Why did you kidnap us?

26:28.720 --> 26:30.360
I heard you love your wife

26:30.440 --> 26:32.120
And lots of concubines

26:32.440 --> 26:33.440
Then it must be hard for you too.

26:33.520 --> 26:34.560
Make a choice, right?

26:34.640 --> 26:38.080
yes. Their lives are now in your hands.

26:38.840 --> 26:40.000
choose one

26:40.360 --> 26:42.280
And we're launching another one.

26:42.360 --> 26:44.040
But those who aren't chosen will become food

26:44.600 --> 26:47.360
For the fish in the lake.

26:49.160 --> 26:50.360
lake?

27:01.680 --> 27:02.840
Which one would you choose?

27:05.240 --> 27:07.720
Why don't you choose anything?

27:07.800 --> 27:08.800
Save yourself from self-blame

27:08.880 --> 27:10.560
Just pick one.

27:50.240 --> 27:52.000
Who choreographed this?

27:53.040 --> 27:56.240
Did you just do this as a joke?

27:58.280 --> 28:00.600
Is this your first time being kidnapped?

28:01.400 --> 28:02.400
Don't you know that you need to conduct a thorough search?

28:02.480 --> 28:03.520
Before taking someone hostage?

28:09.600 --> 28:12.160
You owe me something, Mu Yao.

28:17.840 --> 28:18.960
???government! ???Qian!

28:19.520 --> 28:20.520
Kian!

29:33.040 --> 29:36.120
<i>I never expected that one day I would be happy</i>

29:36.800 --> 29:38.800
<i>I have been exiled.</i>

29:38.880 --> 29:40.520
<i>Thanks to Yubae, I learned to swim.</i>

30:20.800 --> 30:22.160
<i>I can't stay here forever.</i>

30:22.800 --> 30:25.960
The beasts will come out at night.

30:26.520 --> 30:27.560
<i>When in Lingnan</i>

30:28.040 --> 30:29.320
<i>I've heard it once</i>

30:29.400 --> 30:30.480
<i>That there are ordinary people</i>

30:30.560 --> 30:31.880
<i>Living in the upper class</i>

31:05.520 --> 31:08.000
What are you trying to prove?

31:08.680 --> 31:09.840
you should have stayed on the cliff

31:10.320 --> 31:14.000
And wait for Jong Ye-ran to make his choice.

31:14.560 --> 31:15.880
Maybe he was too nervous.

31:15.960 --> 31:17.680
That person made the wrong choice

31:18.560 --> 31:20.200
And I wouldn't be the one he gave up on.

32:11.400 --> 32:13.600
<i>The terrain here is very rough.</i>

32:14.120 --> 32:16.240
<i>Even if Jong Ye-ran sends a man to look for me</i>

32:16.320 --> 32:17.840
<i>It won't arrive that fast.</i>

32:18.400 --> 32:20.000
<i>I suspect it's them.</i>

32:43.480 --> 32:44.600
I finally found you.

32:49.680 --> 32:51.760
I'm so glad it's you!

32:53.320 --> 32:56.160
I am really surprised now.

32:57.400 --> 32:58.400
I didn't expect you to find me.

32:59.440 --> 33:00.840
I finally have someone by my side.

33:03.960 --> 33:05.480
I gave you this bracelet

33:05.560 --> 33:07.000
for your self defense

33:07.880 --> 33:09.000
I'm not saying you should commit suicide.

33:14.040 --> 33:15.200
Are you Hua Rongzhou?

33:26.680 --> 33:27.840
No bone fractures.

33:29.240 --> 33:31.280
I think I need some ointment.

33:32.040 --> 33:33.040
I will carry you on my back.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
I can walk.

33:49.680 --> 33:51.160
We have walked a long distance.

33:51.320 --> 33:52.600
Why can't I see anyone around?

33:55.280 --> 33:56.520
By the way, my brother...

34:02.960 --> 34:03.960
Get on my back.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.000
I'm fine.

34:06.480 --> 34:07.480
Get on my back.

34:11.600 --> 34:12.600
hurry.

34:35.920 --> 34:37.200
I'm not good at drinking.

34:37.800 --> 34:39.120
I'm afraid that something embarrassing will happen later.

34:39.200 --> 34:41.240
Please take me downstairs.

34:41.320 --> 34:43.240
Hostess, I know you can't hold your drink.

34:43.320 --> 34:44.880
???Go quickly. ???Then why did you do that...

34:57.800 --> 34:58.840
what's the matter?

35:00.960 --> 35:02.440
How did you know I was there?

35:03.040 --> 35:04.480
What happened later?

35:04.960 --> 35:06.040
How is my brother?

35:07.800 --> 35:09.720
After you and Mu-cheop were taken away

35:10.120 --> 35:12.920
I followed Master to the top of the mountain.

35:14.200 --> 35:16.360
I don't really know what happened.

35:16.440 --> 35:17.480
After the banquet is over

35:17.560 --> 35:19.080
And Mr. Hwa’s condition.

35:19.320 --> 35:21.160
My sister will be okay, right?

35:25.600 --> 35:26.720
I said I would follow my teacher.

35:26.800 --> 35:27.960
to the top of the mountain

35:28.040 --> 35:29.480
But I didn't see you.

35:30.240 --> 35:31.800
You don't pay any attention to me.

35:32.720 --> 35:33.720
I'm used to it.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.200
No, that's not true.

35:35.480 --> 35:37.720
I was dizzy from falling over a cliff.

35:37.800 --> 35:38.920
So I didn't notice you.

35:39.240 --> 35:40.400
Then do you remember...

35:41.360 --> 35:42.640
When did you first meet me?

35:45.760 --> 35:47.200
Was it during ancestral rites?

35:49.480 --> 35:50.560
Just as I expected.

35:51.800 --> 35:53.000
What does it mean?

35:53.800 --> 35:56.600
Mistress, do you remember?

35:57.920 --> 35:59.320
Did you ask my name four times?

36:01.080 --> 36:02.560
No, I...

36:05.280 --> 36:06.800
Why do I smell blood?

36:07.800 --> 36:08.800
Are you hurt?

36:10.560 --> 36:11.680
It's just a small scratch.

36:12.120 --> 36:15.000
scratch? Did you get hurt in the woods?

36:15.520 --> 36:16.960
Drop me off. I can walk alone.

36:17.040 --> 36:18.200
I have medicine.

36:18.280 --> 36:20.400
But how did you get here?

36:20.480 --> 36:22.000
But why were you alone?

36:22.960 --> 36:24.160
Who else did you expect to see?

36:26.640 --> 36:28.440
Watch your tone!

36:28.520 --> 36:29.680
How dare you say that to me?

36:29.760 --> 36:32.000
How rude! I am your mistress.

36:33.320 --> 36:34.920
You're divorced now, right?

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
me...

36:38.000 --> 36:39.360
I'm older than you

36:39.440 --> 36:40.880
So you still have to respect me.

36:42.640 --> 36:43.720
What should I call you...

36:45.800 --> 36:47.000
After divorce?

36:47.720 --> 36:49.200
<i>That's right.</i>

36:49.280 --> 36:51.240
<i>When they leave Hwangcheong with me</i>

36:51.880 --> 36:53.720
<i>Should they call me Miss?</i>

36:54.640 --> 36:56.960
<i>But I wish they were free</i>

36:57.040 --> 36:58.480
<i>Live your own life.</i>

36:59.440 --> 37:00.480
Or has it never crossed your mind?

37:01.800 --> 37:02.800
to take me with you

37:02.880 --> 37:03.920
When leaving the species residence?

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
That's not true.

37:05.600 --> 37:06.600
For Tsuiju

37:06.680 --> 37:08.240
I'll take you from your servant's residence.

37:11.080 --> 37:13.480
Why did it stop? Are you tired?

37:13.560 --> 37:14.720
I said I could walk by myself.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.240
Get some rest. Hurt...

37:16.320 --> 37:17.760
Don't match me with Cuizhu again.

37:22.160 --> 37:24.040
You can play in the yard

37:24.840 --> 37:26.080
Or when you're attacked

37:27.320 --> 37:29.320
I didn't want you to push me out to Cuizhu.

37:32.680 --> 37:35.000
I told you to rescue Cui Ju. You heard me.

37:35.560 --> 37:36.560
Then why didn't you do it...

37:36.640 --> 37:38.440
Because I like someone.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.080
Who is she?

37:45.800 --> 37:47.120
Is that person in my house?

37:48.320 --> 37:49.440
yes.

37:50.080 --> 37:53.120
It's not kuijou. Are you Qianzhi?

37:53.600 --> 37:55.200
???No ???Yinxing?

37:56.120 --> 37:57.200
no.

37:58.040 --> 37:59.680
I named everyone in my house.

38:00.960 --> 38:02.720
Don't say it's me.

38:09.480 --> 38:11.600
Say it.

38:17.400 --> 38:18.840
Did you say something?

38:18.920 --> 38:20.320
Did you just say something?

38:23.800 --> 38:25.680
you are a handsome man

38:25.760 --> 38:27.720
But to be clear:

38:27.960 --> 38:30.240
I am no longer interested in worldly pleasures

38:30.320 --> 38:31.600
And I don't feel like falling in love

38:32.040 --> 38:33.040
needless to mention

38:33.120 --> 38:35.040
I don't like men younger than me.

38:36.040 --> 38:37.160
If there is someone like Huarongzhou

38:37.240 --> 38:38.400
In a past life

38:38.480 --> 38:40.520
The person who protected me like his life depended on it.

38:40.600 --> 38:42.480
Had I made all those mistakes?

38:44.000 --> 38:46.600
Mistress, can I stop being your bodyguard?

38:46.680 --> 38:48.600
After I help you get what you want?

38:49.200 --> 38:51.800
Of course you can. You are a free man.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.840
But how do I know what I want?

38:54.640 --> 38:55.880
Why are you silent again?

38:55.960 --> 38:56.960
Say it.

39:25.440 --> 39:29.200
Isn't this my room in Qianzhi Hua Residence?

39:30.160 --> 39:31.160
Yes that's right.

39:32.880 --> 39:34.400
Hua Rongzhou brought me here?

39:35.880 --> 39:36.880
yes.

39:39.080 --> 39:41.360
oh my god. I was confused for a while.

39:41.920 --> 39:44.880
I thought I was reborn.

39:46.560 --> 39:48.280
By the way, how is my brother?

39:48.360 --> 39:49.720
I believe he wasn't seriously hurt.

39:54.880 --> 39:55.880
Qianzhi.

39:58.960 --> 40:00.240
Why are you crying?

40:01.680 --> 40:03.720
Hostess, Master Hwayoung...

40:16.400 --> 40:17.520
government!

40:54.920 --> 40:56.040
Stop.

40:57.600 --> 40:58.680
Stop.

40:59.240 --> 41:00.360
Where is my brother?

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
that...

41:36.440 --> 41:39.280
<i>Bonus video</i>

41:45.680 --> 41:47.840
tell the chef to get ready

41:47.920 --> 41:50.440
Bamboo shoot soup for Qi Ruxin.

41:50.520 --> 41:51.920
It's her favorite dish.

41:52.520 --> 41:54.560
Come to think of it, that person didn't eat anything.

41:55.800 --> 41:57.440
Yes, Your Majesty.

42:14.040 --> 42:15.040
Throw it away.

42:15.800 --> 42:16.800
yes.

42:22.680 --> 42:25.000
What happened to that girl?
