<i>Episode 5</i>

02:03.960 --> 02:05.520
There is no need to be nervous.

02:05.600 --> 02:06.800
I will not rebuke you.

02:06.880 --> 02:08.160
I was just asking.

02:08.600 --> 02:11.000
In the end, Hua Shen didn't receive much money.

02:15.160 --> 02:17.840
Lord, Your Majesty has sent a message.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.160
He said that Mr. Jong was here.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.600
And I'm looking for a mistress.

02:23.320 --> 02:24.360
OK.

02:24.680 --> 02:26.560
Let's go to mother's house.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
mother.

02:35.120 --> 02:36.120
long time no see.

02:40.760 --> 02:42.000
Thank you for Richie, Mom.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.160
Does it taste good?

02:44.600 --> 02:45.600
what's the problem?

02:50.720 --> 02:53.200
Master and Mistress really love each other.

02:53.280 --> 02:54.920
We're really jealous of that.

03:00.520 --> 03:02.840
Senior, it’s been a while since I saw you.

03:02.920 --> 03:04.520
And I'm wondering what you're doing.

03:04.920 --> 03:06.240
I was busy with work

03:06.840 --> 03:08.160
So I took a break today.

03:30.840 --> 03:32.920
Did someone give you a hard time earlier?

03:36.080 --> 03:37.160
Kian

03:37.680 --> 03:40.000
Why are you keeping everything to yourself now?

03:40.320 --> 03:42.440
You used to consult me ​​on everything.

03:47.040 --> 03:48.360
i solved

03:48.440 --> 03:50.960
Mu Yao's hatred towards me

03:51.040 --> 03:53.200
And she doesn't want to kill me anymore.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.000
But Jonggong, who had nothing to do,

03:55.080 --> 03:56.080
Before with my family

03:56.160 --> 03:58.760
They started turning their backs on us.

03:58.840 --> 04:02.080
Can't the original ending be changed?

04:02.160 --> 04:04.720
Where did I go wrong this time?

04:08.920 --> 04:10.000
Kian.

04:12.240 --> 04:13.240
Kian.

04:14.240 --> 04:15.240
Kian!

04:16.960 --> 04:19.360
You were dazed again. Did you hear me?

04:20.960 --> 04:22.040
sorry.

04:22.640 --> 04:24.640
The scent here is a bit dizzy

04:24.720 --> 04:25.920
So I haven't heard from you now.

04:28.240 --> 04:29.960
The carriage has no scent.

04:32.320 --> 04:33.800
But it smells.

04:33.880 --> 04:34.920
Kian

04:36.080 --> 04:37.280
I think you have a lot on your mind.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.560
After we got married.

04:39.160 --> 04:40.320
you don't have to tell me

04:40.400 --> 04:41.440
What are you thinking?

04:42.160 --> 04:45.120
Just remember that as long as I'm here

04:45.200 --> 04:46.320
I will protect you.

04:47.680 --> 04:48.680
There is no need to go to the hostess

04:48.760 --> 04:49.840
Even if I'm angry

04:50.200 --> 04:52.000
And you don't want to spend time with me.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.640
I won't go to you...

04:58.120 --> 04:59.760
Unless you want me to do that.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.400
<i>Am I really that kind of person...</i>

05:09.960 --> 05:11.520
<i>Want to protect?</i>

05:21.400 --> 05:22.440
to let go.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.480
late. It's better to go to bed.

05:28.760 --> 05:32.120
Miss, my father asked me

05:32.200 --> 05:34.120
About the situation here a few days ago.

05:37.640 --> 05:39.160
Are you my maid?

05:39.640 --> 05:41.080
Or my father's maid?

05:41.440 --> 05:43.760
I am your maid, lady.

05:44.160 --> 05:45.240
really?

05:45.520 --> 05:47.160
I don't think so.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.680
Your father cares about you.

05:50.680 --> 05:54.520
After all, you've been here for years

05:55.120 --> 05:57.440
And the marriageable age is approaching.

05:58.240 --> 06:00.760
But you are not close to His Highness.

06:01.680 --> 06:03.160
i am afraid

06:03.240 --> 06:06.200
The person will be unhappy about it.

06:06.560 --> 06:08.880
I lived in the servant's garden as he wanted.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.320
Why is he still dissatisfied?

06:11.800 --> 06:15.080
I only know the life of a maid.

06:15.640 --> 06:17.760
It's in the hands of the owner.

06:18.520 --> 06:20.440
if they are not happy

06:20.880 --> 06:22.280
They can beat us

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Or sell us as you please.

06:27.840 --> 06:30.400
All right. You may go now.

06:32.200 --> 06:33.200
I'm going to sleep.

06:34.520 --> 06:35.520
OK.

08:17.160 --> 08:18.320
government.

08:18.600 --> 08:19.600
government.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.560
Don't wake me up.

08:21.640 --> 08:22.800
I'll try to sleep some more.

08:22.880 --> 08:24.600
I won't go to the Bell Garden today.

08:31.440 --> 08:33.400
What are you doing today, mistress?

08:33.760 --> 08:35.040
Qian Zhi tried to wake you three times.

08:35.120 --> 08:36.840
It will soon be noon.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.760
You have to wake up.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.200
no.

08:47.720 --> 08:48.800
You are on fire.

08:48.880 --> 08:50.360
Qianzhi, call the doctor.

08:50.440 --> 08:51.440
OK.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.120
Doctor Xia, how are you?

09:11.200 --> 09:15.000
Master probably caught a cold last night.

09:15.600 --> 09:16.840
I'll prescribe some medicine

09:16.920 --> 09:18.800
And aromatherapy.

09:18.880 --> 09:20.480
It's my fault. I slept like a log

09:20.560 --> 09:22.120
And there was no sound of wind.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.200
I looked at the window

09:23.280 --> 09:25.360
The hostess's room is open this morning.

09:25.760 --> 09:27.280
How can you be so careless?

09:27.640 --> 09:28.840
she's okay

09:28.920 --> 09:30.840
She just needs to take the medicine.

09:30.920 --> 09:31.920
OK.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.840
Be careful not to let her catch a cold.

09:34.120 --> 09:35.720
Please come this way.

09:35.800 --> 09:36.840
thank you

09:40.600 --> 09:44.480
I was trying to make an excuse

09:44.560 --> 09:45.600
But now I have a good reason

09:46.200 --> 09:48.400
Don't go to Bell's Garden.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.360
If you don't want to go

09:52.440 --> 09:54.040
Just don't go, mistress.

09:54.120 --> 09:55.240
You don't understand.

09:55.360 --> 09:57.040
I go there too often.

09:57.320 --> 09:59.520
If you don't follow what happened yesterday

09:59.600 --> 10:00.920
It will look very suspicious.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.080
What happened yesterday?

10:09.960 --> 10:10.960
<i>Shende Hall</i>

10:11.040 --> 10:12.040
master.

10:12.480 --> 10:14.760
The hostess has a cold, but she will be fine.

10:15.080 --> 10:17.280
He prescribed medicine.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.760
And she just needs to keep warm.

10:19.840 --> 10:21.240
all right. You better go now.

10:21.680 --> 10:22.680
I will leave.

10:32.360 --> 10:33.360
master.

10:34.080 --> 10:36.680
Teacher, are you going to see me?

10:38.360 --> 10:40.960
It's better not to bother her now.

10:42.560 --> 10:44.080
Send a message to Hua Residence.

10:44.760 --> 10:45.920
He must miss his family very much.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.080
When she is sick.

10:48.720 --> 10:49.720
OK.

11:12.320 --> 11:14.720
Master, please eat this before you go to sleep.

11:22.320 --> 11:23.560
Is it too bitter?

11:23.640 --> 11:24.640
I prepared preserved fruit for you.

11:24.720 --> 11:25.760
government.

11:29.960 --> 11:32.200
not needed. This is nothing.

11:38.920 --> 11:40.680
Teacher, Deacon J has arrived.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.280
Hello, mistress.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.640
what's the matter?

11:48.720 --> 11:49.880
government.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.720
There was a lack of manpower

11:51.800 --> 11:53.040
A new guard has just been recruited.

11:53.360 --> 11:54.600
Here is the list.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.360
For inspection, hostess.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.640
not needed. You have experience.

11:58.720 --> 12:00.680
Just do whatever you want.

12:01.360 --> 12:02.760
Then I will leave.

12:20.680 --> 12:21.800
majesty.

12:21.880 --> 12:23.720
It's already noon.

12:24.480 --> 12:27.040
Why isn't he here today?

12:28.440 --> 12:31.520
I sent someone to inquire in advance.

12:32.200 --> 12:34.800
The hostess has a cold.

12:35.440 --> 12:36.560
cold?

12:37.760 --> 12:40.120
That person must be very sick

12:40.400 --> 12:43.760
Because Master called the doctor.

12:44.760 --> 12:46.360
bring me

12:46.440 --> 12:48.760
The incense beads she sent me a few days ago.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.680
You shouldn't leave it alone all the time.

12:52.680 --> 12:53.920
however

12:54.000 --> 12:57.200
Choose Nutrient-Dense Herbs

12:57.280 --> 12:58.680
In a warehouse for her.

12:59.360 --> 13:01.680
She is too thin.

13:01.760 --> 13:03.360
Strangely enough, she is not in good health.

13:03.440 --> 13:05.080
And they are prone to diseases.

13:06.520 --> 13:08.320
Yes, Your Majesty.

13:21.440 --> 13:22.880
???Lord, hello. ???You can wake up.

13:22.960 --> 13:23.960
Sit.

13:25.160 --> 13:26.720
I heard you called a doctor earlier.

13:26.800 --> 13:27.800
What's wrong with you?

13:27.880 --> 13:28.920
Are you feeling unwell?

13:29.240 --> 13:30.520
naught.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.400
I just didn't sleep well last night.

13:32.480 --> 13:34.120
And when I woke up, my head hurt.

13:34.640 --> 13:36.040
So I asked to see a doctor.

13:36.640 --> 13:37.800
What did he say?

13:37.880 --> 13:39.640
They said it wasn't anything serious.

13:40.040 --> 13:41.960
And prescribed a sedative.

13:42.840 --> 13:43.960
you are helping my mom

13:44.040 --> 13:45.640
to take care of household chores

13:45.720 --> 13:46.720
And it's hard work.

13:47.640 --> 13:49.200
I'm glad I can do it

13:49.280 --> 13:50.680
Lord, share your concerns.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.040
I lost weight recently.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.000
There is so much to do here.

13:55.080 --> 13:56.560
If you are offended

13:56.840 --> 13:58.440
Just invite your family.

13:59.160 --> 14:00.560
Isn't this your mother and sister?

14:00.640 --> 14:01.880
Are you still in the city?

14:03.440 --> 14:04.440
my sister's birthday

14:04.520 --> 14:06.120
It will arrive in 4-5 days.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.680
She is young and spoiled

14:09.080 --> 14:10.680
And he asked me to meet my father.

14:11.320 --> 14:13.600
Mom had no choice

14:13.880 --> 14:15.240
But yesterday I tried to take her out of town.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.400
They set off to visit my father in the south.

14:17.800 --> 14:20.520
And it will stay there for a while.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.920
Butler Meng lived there for many years.

14:23.440 --> 14:25.080
And it rarely comes back.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.960
It is normal for a child to miss his father.

14:28.520 --> 14:30.920
we are very grateful

14:31.000 --> 14:33.160
Lord, thank you for trusting our family.

14:36.360 --> 14:39.960
But I heard your Majesty say

14:40.040 --> 14:42.360
I asked to call the doctor this morning too.

14:43.760 --> 14:45.080
What's wrong with my mom?

14:45.160 --> 14:46.960
Your Majesty is fine.

14:47.280 --> 14:48.600
She just gave orders to the doctor.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.480
To prepare nutritious herbs

14:51.200 --> 14:53.760
And he sent it to his mistress.

14:54.040 --> 14:55.880
I think someone has a cold.

15:05.680 --> 15:06.880
cold...

15:07.840 --> 15:09.920
The female lead has changed a lot.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.320
And it's more likable

15:11.800 --> 15:13.600
After she got married.

15:13.920 --> 15:16.560
No wonder Her Majesty treats her more kindly now.

15:17.400 --> 15:19.000
My mom is good at talking to him.

15:19.080 --> 15:20.760
So she naturally takes an interest in her.

15:21.480 --> 15:22.600
It's true.

15:29.840 --> 15:31.000
Be careful, mother.

15:31.600 --> 15:32.760
go.

15:33.840 --> 15:35.000
This herb is valuable.

15:35.080 --> 15:36.400
I will watch them move it.

15:37.280 --> 15:38.680
You do that.

15:38.760 --> 15:39.760
I am going to see my sister now.

15:39.840 --> 15:40.920
Stop.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.360
Don't run around.

15:44.760 --> 15:47.160
This is not our home, it is our species residence.

15:47.240 --> 15:48.320
Did you hear me?

15:48.400 --> 15:50.360
???Okay... ???Act confidently.

15:50.440 --> 15:51.440
let's go...

15:53.200 --> 15:54.240
go.

16:17.160 --> 16:18.320
to let go.

16:20.560 --> 16:21.600
do you know

16:21.680 --> 16:23.720
Where does your mistress live?

16:28.520 --> 16:29.840
We've never been here before

16:29.920 --> 16:31.000
And I don't know the way.

16:31.400 --> 16:32.400
I wonder if it's convenient

16:32.480 --> 16:34.720
So that you can take me there.

16:39.480 --> 16:40.520
Can you do it?

16:43.280 --> 16:45.160
Sir, I have been here before.

16:45.240 --> 16:46.240
I still remember the road.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.480
Are you the eldest son of the Hua family?

16:51.040 --> 16:52.200
Do you know me?

16:54.680 --> 16:55.800
Where are you going?

16:58.160 --> 16:59.240
teacher

16:59.560 --> 17:00.560
Didn't you go see your sister?

17:02.680 --> 17:03.720
What is this place?

17:04.360 --> 17:05.840
<i>Shende Hall</i>

17:06.480 --> 17:08.080
It must be Master Zhong's study.

17:09.520 --> 17:12.120
Did the maid notice?

17:12.640 --> 17:14.120
Does it look a little different?

17:15.760 --> 17:18.200
Sir, aren't all your concubines?

17:18.280 --> 17:19.520
Isn’t it different after all?

17:23.680 --> 17:24.840
Stop.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.120
Tell me what you mean.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.280
How dare you talk to me like that?

17:30.280 --> 17:32.520
Kian. mother.

17:33.200 --> 17:34.520
Didn't you leave before me?

17:34.600 --> 17:36.280
Why are you so late?

17:38.280 --> 17:39.440
Huang took me in the wrong direction.

17:39.880 --> 17:41.440
So we decided to take the longer route.

17:52.240 --> 17:55.240
Qian, I heard you were sick.

17:55.320 --> 17:57.400
You seem to have lost a lot of weight.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.920
Mom, do you feel that way?

18:00.000 --> 18:01.400
Probably because we haven't seen each other in a while.

18:02.880 --> 18:05.880
Your father and I stayed at the clan house.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.280
over a month

18:07.360 --> 18:09.720
Because what happened to your cousin

18:09.800 --> 18:11.280
In the Garden of Bells.

18:11.600 --> 18:12.840
we just got back

18:12.920 --> 18:14.800
I heard he got you into trouble again.

18:15.640 --> 18:17.080
Yes, I did.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.920
It's a very big problem.

18:30.600 --> 18:31.600
Kian.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.760
You have never bought jewelry

18:33.840 --> 18:35.680
since you got married

18:35.760 --> 18:37.720
So I bought some especially for you.

18:38.080 --> 18:39.320
For the past few days.

18:39.400 --> 18:40.480
I have a lot of these.

18:43.280 --> 18:44.760
How can you say something like that?

18:44.840 --> 18:46.720
Your brother is really interested in you.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.240
And I bought all the good things

18:48.320 --> 18:50.840
In our jewelry store for you.

18:50.920 --> 18:52.760
He got me nothing.

18:58.480 --> 19:00.400
I know you won't be angry with me.

19:00.480 --> 19:01.520
Stupid kid.

19:01.920 --> 19:03.440
You have the same blood.

19:03.520 --> 19:05.120
Of course she will forgive you.

19:05.720 --> 19:08.520
You're right, mother. Qian is blessed.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.800
This house is really great

19:11.160 --> 19:12.760
And it's much better than my house.

19:13.600 --> 19:15.360
That's not all. Even the servants here

19:15.440 --> 19:16.480
Look different from others.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.320
when i came

19:18.400 --> 19:19.520
I saw the maid

19:19.600 --> 19:21.120
It's coming from my brother-in-law's study.

19:21.200 --> 19:23.040
she looks pretty

19:24.200 --> 19:26.120
But I don't think I've ever seen her

19:26.200 --> 19:27.360
Around you before.

19:28.040 --> 19:29.200
Who is she?

19:30.560 --> 19:31.720
Studying for a master's degree?

19:33.800 --> 19:36.000
I have enough maids in my house.

19:36.440 --> 19:38.920
I went to your lab last time.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
I looked into it and found that there was a lack of manpower.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.720
I will let Mu Yao go there and serve you.

19:46.080 --> 19:48.560
<i>We were both friends in a past life</i>

19:48.640 --> 19:50.840
<i>But she and Hua Shen didn't know each other at all</i>

19:51.360 --> 19:52.920
<i>So no wonder he didn't recognize her</i>

19:57.560 --> 19:59.320
Why are you asking about his maid?

20:00.560 --> 20:02.040
I'm just asking

20:02.120 --> 20:03.160
Huaxian!

20:03.720 --> 20:05.440
Keep your head straight!

20:05.520 --> 20:06.760
You know Jong Ye-ran...

20:08.200 --> 20:09.200
his staff

20:09.280 --> 20:10.840
You're not the type of person who can design.

20:11.120 --> 20:13.720
???I... ???You've always been a playboy

20:13.800 --> 20:15.480
But don't get us into trouble!

20:15.560 --> 20:19.280
Kian, boil some. I was just asking.

20:19.360 --> 20:21.000
I don't dare get involved with the staff here.

20:21.080 --> 20:22.680
Now please shut up.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.920
Don't talk like that.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.440
You know how my brother is.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.560
He just says whatever comes to mind.

20:32.320 --> 20:33.840
however

20:34.120 --> 20:36.840
Now Master, is there a maid next to you?

20:37.240 --> 20:39.520
Doesn't he hate being served by maids?

20:40.040 --> 20:41.200
What do you know about that maid?

20:41.280 --> 20:43.640
Mother, what should we do now?

20:43.720 --> 20:45.560
keep an eye on your son

20:45.640 --> 20:47.160
Do not interfere in the affairs of the head family.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.080
I'm just looking out for your best interests.

20:51.800 --> 20:53.840
Why are you angry?

21:03.960 --> 21:05.200
at last

21:06.000 --> 21:08.360
You have only one brother among them.

21:08.440 --> 21:11.200
And he will be your only family in the future.

21:11.480 --> 21:13.800
Even if that person is a bit blunt

21:14.240 --> 21:16.800
He still treats you sincerely.

21:16.880 --> 21:19.480
Mother, you were always partial to that person.

21:19.560 --> 21:20.760
Look what he did.

21:20.840 --> 21:22.840
Calling him dull is a compliment to him.

21:23.800 --> 21:24.840
listen.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.760
when i was pregnant with you

21:26.840 --> 21:28.280
He was only five years old.

21:28.360 --> 21:29.840
He came to me every day

21:30.560 --> 21:32.160
Ask when you will be born.

21:32.240 --> 21:33.840
He said he would protect you

21:34.120 --> 21:35.680
and i love you

21:35.760 --> 21:36.800
Please give a message to mom and dad

21:36.880 --> 21:38.280
After you go back.

21:39.120 --> 21:40.160
What is that?

21:40.600 --> 21:43.160
“A small leak will sink a big ship.”

21:43.880 --> 21:45.080
What does it mean?

21:45.160 --> 21:48.200
Dad, do you know what my brother did?

21:48.280 --> 21:49.680
To the store he is in charge of.

21:49.760 --> 21:51.680
I don't think I need to say more.

21:52.680 --> 21:55.040
Tell me what my brother did today

21:55.720 --> 21:57.520
Then he will understand what I said.

21:58.120 --> 21:59.520
The store is owned by the Zhong family.

21:59.920 --> 22:01.720
My brother needs to be disciplined.

22:03.800 --> 22:04.800
<i>Hwa Residence</i>

22:04.880 --> 22:06.120
How about Qian?

22:08.040 --> 22:10.520
That person looks weak

22:10.800 --> 22:12.560
But I still feel energetic

22:12.920 --> 22:14.640
So I don't think she is seriously ill.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.200
exorbitant.

22:19.280 --> 22:20.760
???You’d better go now. ???Yes, ma’am.

22:21.640 --> 22:22.640
Where is Shen?

22:24.840 --> 22:25.960
he said

22:26.440 --> 22:28.680
That person didn't finish his homework

22:28.760 --> 22:30.200
So he went back to his room.

22:33.200 --> 22:35.760
Did he go back to studying?

22:35.840 --> 22:37.840
Did the sun rise in the west today?

22:38.400 --> 22:39.480
He must have sneaked out again.

22:39.560 --> 22:41.720
To play with his friends.

22:41.800 --> 22:43.320
How can that be?

22:43.400 --> 22:45.040
Qian is still sick.

22:45.120 --> 22:46.880
He's worried about her.

22:46.960 --> 22:48.320
So he won't go out and play

22:48.400 --> 22:49.880
Times like this.

22:51.040 --> 22:52.840
I know that?

22:52.920 --> 22:55.320
I am not worried about Qian’s marriage now.

22:55.960 --> 22:57.400
But I am worried about Shen’s marriage.

22:57.920 --> 22:59.720
That person is not young

23:00.080 --> 23:02.760
But it's not stable yet.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.000
Don't rush.

23:04.080 --> 23:06.600
Qian is now Master Zhong's wife.

23:06.680 --> 23:07.880
There are many merchants in this town.

23:07.960 --> 23:10.680
I want to become relatives through marriage.

23:10.760 --> 23:12.160
He doesn't need to get married.

23:13.120 --> 23:15.600
But my son has no talent for reading and writing.

23:15.680 --> 23:16.880
It's not even an outstanding martial art.

23:17.240 --> 23:18.520
In my opinion

23:18.600 --> 23:21.040
That's not important

23:21.120 --> 23:22.360
Even if the girl is from an ordinary family.

23:22.440 --> 23:23.440
He can handle her easily.

23:23.520 --> 23:24.840
And you won't be bullied.

23:25.480 --> 23:27.120
Even if that person is no exception

23:27.200 --> 23:29.440
He is still our only son.

23:29.920 --> 23:31.200
Daughters from ordinary families

23:31.280 --> 23:33.240
You can't marry into my family.

23:33.320 --> 23:35.080
I know what you mean.

23:36.160 --> 23:37.320
But think about it.

23:37.840 --> 23:40.560
Shen has many concubines.

23:41.440 --> 23:42.920
When a nobleman's daughter marries him

23:43.000 --> 23:44.520
And then I found out

23:45.480 --> 23:46.960
She will be angry.

23:51.000 --> 23:55.400
He must be disciplined.

23:55.480 --> 23:57.760
I never stopped him.

23:57.840 --> 23:59.320
From taking a concubine

23:59.400 --> 24:02.120
But he still goes out and plays around.

24:02.480 --> 24:05.440
A man must be ambitious

24:05.720 --> 24:07.040
But he's acting stupid

24:07.120 --> 24:09.840
With his concubines all day long.

24:10.720 --> 24:12.240
when i go there

24:12.320 --> 24:13.960
There isn't even enough space for me.

24:14.960 --> 24:16.120
OK...

24:16.360 --> 24:18.040
Don't be angry.

24:18.120 --> 24:19.600
you are right I must discipline that person.

24:20.320 --> 24:23.160
Curb his rash behavior.

24:23.840 --> 24:24.920
wait.

24:26.320 --> 24:27.400
This is strange.

24:27.480 --> 24:30.080
???what? ???Aren’t you always on his side?

24:30.760 --> 24:32.040
What happened today?

24:32.120 --> 24:34.000
Why the sudden change?

24:34.840 --> 24:36.760
Did he cause trouble at the bell residence?

24:36.840 --> 24:39.120
no...

24:39.560 --> 24:40.920
me...

24:41.560 --> 24:43.000
I just noticed that

24:43.080 --> 24:44.720
Policing has matured

24:44.800 --> 24:46.160
after getting married

24:48.320 --> 24:52.640
And Shen can't live up to her.

24:52.720 --> 24:54.200
<i>Store Director</i>

24:54.280 --> 24:55.920
she has changed so much

24:56.000 --> 24:57.240
After getting married.

24:57.840 --> 25:00.960
What did she say to you today?

25:01.840 --> 25:05.960
Nothing, just minor things.

25:06.400 --> 25:07.880
Let me remove these.

25:10.240 --> 25:12.080
self...

25:12.960 --> 25:15.840
Honey, don’t worry about Shen’s marriage.

25:19.200 --> 25:21.600
???You’re really handsome. ???right?

25:21.680 --> 25:24.040
He has white skin and long eyelashes.

25:24.120 --> 25:25.200
right?

25:25.280 --> 25:26.560
You fell in love with him.

25:26.640 --> 25:27.880
What about the racket?

25:27.960 --> 25:30.560
The mistress is sick. Quiet.

25:30.640 --> 25:32.720
Qianzhi, I told you many times.

25:32.800 --> 25:34.000
Gently.

25:34.080 --> 25:35.600
Don't act like this all the time.

25:36.080 --> 25:38.680
I think you're the loudest here.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.280
What happen?

25:42.360 --> 25:43.360
What are you so happy about?

25:43.920 --> 25:45.240
Didn’t you hear, Mistress?

25:45.320 --> 25:46.880
Several new guards were recruited.

25:48.520 --> 25:50.400
G. Butler mentioned it to me.

25:50.480 --> 25:51.480
what's the matter?

25:51.560 --> 25:54.120
One of them is so handsome

25:54.200 --> 25:56.400
The maids went to check on him.

25:57.680 --> 25:58.680
really?

25:59.600 --> 26:00.960
But it doesn't leave much of an impression.

26:01.040 --> 26:02.960
Of this handsome security guard.

26:03.760 --> 26:06.680
Mistress, you were sick the day he joined us.

26:06.760 --> 26:08.320
So you've never seen him.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.800
Lady, you too will be surprised.

26:09.880 --> 26:11.280
When I finally met him.

26:11.360 --> 26:15.040
I have never seen such a handsome man.

26:15.680 --> 26:17.240
You both are so ignorant.

26:17.320 --> 26:18.320
He's just a security guard.

26:18.400 --> 26:19.400
What good is His beauty?

26:20.000 --> 26:21.800
if you've ever seen him

26:21.880 --> 26:23.440
You wouldn't say that.

26:23.880 --> 26:25.840
I am not as ignorant as you.

26:27.560 --> 26:28.760
After hearing what you said

26:28.840 --> 26:30.200
I miss him.

26:32.880 --> 26:35.400
Mistress, you are still recovering.

26:35.480 --> 26:37.720
By the way, he is just a servant.

26:37.800 --> 26:38.800
no one in the world

26:38.880 --> 26:40.600
It can be compared to Master Zhong.

26:43.720 --> 26:45.320
It was just a passing comment.

26:46.120 --> 26:48.480
Master's birthday is 15 days away.

26:48.560 --> 26:50.720
What are your plans, mistress?

26:51.040 --> 26:52.040
birthday?

26:52.400 --> 26:53.600
Master's birthday!

26:53.680 --> 26:55.160
Have you forgotten, mistress?

26:57.840 --> 26:59.320
<i>What is Jong Ye-ran’s birthday?</i>

27:00.280 --> 27:01.560
<i>I forgot</i>

27:02.040 --> 27:03.040
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

27:03.280 --> 27:05.200
<i>Isn’t that the beginning of a relationship</i>

27:05.280 --> 27:06.680
<i>Between him and Mu Yao?</i>

27:13.440 --> 27:15.320
Teacher, it's late.

27:15.400 --> 27:16.600
Now it's time to go back.

27:16.880 --> 27:18.560
Today is your birthday.

27:19.640 --> 27:21.720
I want to stay with my mom longer.

27:31.480 --> 27:33.240
Why are you kneeling here?

27:33.320 --> 27:35.480
Did your parents punish you too?

27:36.880 --> 27:38.400
No one punished me.

27:38.920 --> 27:40.800
I do it of my own volition.

27:40.880 --> 27:42.440
what's the matter?

27:42.520 --> 27:45.520
Why do you want to kneel here?

27:46.760 --> 27:48.960
My mom's tablet is here.

27:50.200 --> 27:51.720
My father often says

27:51.800 --> 27:54.880
Parents want to see their children

27:54.960 --> 27:58.080
Live a happy and carefree life.

27:58.160 --> 27:59.680
What do you think?

27:59.760 --> 28:01.960
your mom wants you

28:02.040 --> 28:04.760
kneel in front of the tablet

28:04.840 --> 28:06.880
With a sad face?

28:07.800 --> 28:09.400
I've never met her before.

28:10.240 --> 28:11.760
the day i was born

28:12.240 --> 28:14.400
she...

28:15.600 --> 28:19.240
Every mother loves her children.

28:19.320 --> 28:21.920
He's probably on his knees

28:22.000 --> 28:25.560
I already broke her heart.

28:29.160 --> 28:32.080
Would you like to go to the theater with me?

28:41.720 --> 28:43.720
I was told that this temple carries our prayers.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.080
Let's go pray together.

29:23.920 --> 29:26.320
OK. Now that I have brought you here

29:26.400 --> 29:28.440
I will go to my father.

29:29.680 --> 29:31.160
What is your name?

29:31.240 --> 29:32.240
my father said

29:32.320 --> 29:35.120
You shouldn't say my name to strangers.

29:35.680 --> 29:38.720
Can I see your face?

29:39.160 --> 29:41.520
no. There's a rash on her face

29:41.600 --> 29:43.040
So I can't take off the veil.

29:47.800 --> 29:49.280
This is for you.

29:49.360 --> 29:51.320
If you want to see me again next time

29:51.400 --> 29:52.640
just show me

29:52.720 --> 29:55.560
To the abbot of this temple.

29:56.120 --> 29:58.200
Okay... I'll take it.

29:58.280 --> 29:59.840
Seeing you around.

30:10.640 --> 30:14.520
Mom, I will visit you another day.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.040
<i>Oh my god</i>

30:19.520 --> 30:21.120
<i>If you want to give me another chance</i>

30:21.400 --> 30:22.600
<i>Why didn't you send me back</i>

30:22.680 --> 30:24.520
<i>Before I impersonated her?</i>

30:25.080 --> 30:28.640
<i>It's too difficult to turn back now.</i>

30:39.200 --> 30:40.360
government.

30:40.640 --> 30:41.640
OK.

30:45.200 --> 30:47.640
How will you plan your birthday party?

30:49.840 --> 30:50.880
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

30:51.080 --> 30:52.880
<i>I remember that day</i>

30:52.960 --> 30:55.320
<i>The Lord came to the banquet unexpectedly</i>

30:55.400 --> 30:56.960
<i>And falls in love with Mu Yao at first sight</i>

30:57.520 --> 30:59.560
<i>That person treated me like that a few days ago.</i>

30:59.880 --> 31:01.800
<i>Now is the perfect time to distract him</i>

31:02.360 --> 31:04.240
<i>So he won't be preoccupied with it</i>

31:04.320 --> 31:05.680
<i>Acts that harm my family</i>

31:06.560 --> 31:08.240
Let's keep it quiet.

31:08.320 --> 31:09.800
After all, it belongs to his mother too...

31:14.360 --> 31:17.480
I don't think he would like the fanfare.

31:21.600 --> 31:23.760
Lady, how about I go to the warehouse now?

31:23.840 --> 31:25.680
And will you take back the <i>guchin</i> that Master gave you?

31:25.760 --> 31:26.760
Exquisite <i>Guqin</i>

31:26.840 --> 31:28.040
And your excellent playing skills

31:28.120 --> 31:29.680
It will definitely surprise everyone.

31:29.760 --> 31:30.800
not needed.

31:36.360 --> 31:37.560
yes. Go get it.

31:38.120 --> 31:39.120
confident.

31:51.480 --> 31:52.480
master.

31:52.560 --> 31:54.480
The mistress's maid Qianzhi wants to meet you.

31:58.040 --> 31:59.200
Hello, Master.

32:00.680 --> 32:02.880
The hostess asked me to send her a message.

32:02.960 --> 32:04.560
she wants you to come back early

32:04.640 --> 32:06.080
After work today.

32:06.160 --> 32:08.720
She prepared a birthday feast for you.

32:10.520 --> 32:13.280
not needed. I never celebrate my birthday.

32:13.560 --> 32:14.880
But she started preparing for it

32:14.960 --> 32:16.280
Half a month ago.

32:25.840 --> 32:26.840
OK.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.920
<i>Shende Hall</i>

32:54.680 --> 32:55.920
<i>Guchin</i> is ready.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.120
Should I take it out now?

32:57.640 --> 33:00.320
not needed. Follow my lead later.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.400
But please put another chair here.

33:03.480 --> 33:05.760
May the Lord sit down.

33:06.560 --> 33:07.560
Is he coming too?

33:07.640 --> 33:09.160
Master didn't mention it.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.200
Just trust me.

33:15.520 --> 33:17.640
The quality of this batch of blood pumpkins

33:17.720 --> 33:19.040
Not as good as the previous batch.

33:19.120 --> 33:20.920
If you use this to make gainhwan,

33:21.200 --> 33:22.440
It will be much less effective

33:23.240 --> 33:25.760
That will ruin our reputation.

33:26.760 --> 33:28.480
In case of insufficient supply

33:29.040 --> 33:31.760
I'm worried we might have to sell it.

33:31.840 --> 33:33.080
The number of pills decreases every year.

33:40.320 --> 33:41.400
difference.

33:44.800 --> 33:45.800
difference!

33:46.720 --> 33:47.840
what's the matter?

33:48.040 --> 33:50.200
Is there anything else to do?

33:52.680 --> 33:53.720
Lord.

33:54.320 --> 33:55.600
I have other things to do today.

33:55.680 --> 33:57.760
Let's synthesize the perfume another day.

33:59.800 --> 34:01.240
I almost forgot.

34:01.320 --> 34:03.240
Are you going to the temple again this year?

34:04.400 --> 34:05.440
No, it doesn't.

34:05.880 --> 34:07.360
When I left this morning

34:07.440 --> 34:08.720
Qian sent a message

34:09.520 --> 34:11.440
They said they prepared a banquet.

34:11.520 --> 34:12.680
And I decided to go back early today.

34:14.800 --> 34:17.120
I would like to attend this banquet.

34:17.680 --> 34:19.120
Because it piqued your interest.

34:20.360 --> 34:22.240
It's just a family meal.

34:22.320 --> 34:23.880
i will be happy

34:23.960 --> 34:25.240
If you go with me, Lord.

34:25.720 --> 34:29.440
I'll change into different clothes.

34:29.920 --> 34:30.920
OK.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.120
Hello, Lord.

34:36.200 --> 34:37.760
Today is my senior’s birthday.

34:37.840 --> 34:38.840
I'm just following along.

34:38.920 --> 34:39.920
There is no need for that format.

34:51.160 --> 34:52.680
Mistress, you were right.

34:52.760 --> 34:53.760
Lord, you have really come.

34:58.960 --> 35:00.120
Go get ready.

35:11.080 --> 35:12.360
I think you have a cook in your house.

35:12.440 --> 35:14.680
I'm very good at making spicy food.

35:16.200 --> 35:17.760
The owner likes this taste

35:17.840 --> 35:20.120
So I spoke specifically to the chef today.

35:24.760 --> 35:27.480
Master has been feeling unwell these days.

35:27.840 --> 35:29.760
The doctor told him to avoid spices.

35:36.840 --> 35:40.360
Should I ask the chef to make other dishes as well?

35:40.680 --> 35:42.360
are you okay. I am already much better now.

36:05.280 --> 36:07.280
Mistress, I am ready for you.

36:11.440 --> 36:13.480
It's a bit boring to just eat it.

36:14.240 --> 36:17.960
Previously, Master gave me a rare <i>Guqin</i>.

36:18.720 --> 36:20.360
today is your birthday

36:20.440 --> 36:23.280
So I brought it out for you today.

36:25.160 --> 36:28.760
I heard that Mo Yao is very good at acting <i>Guqin</i>.

36:29.080 --> 36:30.280
I wonder

36:30.760 --> 36:33.880
If only I could play a song for the master.

36:48.280 --> 36:49.280
government...

36:50.240 --> 36:51.840
Do you need anything else, Mu Yao?

37:41.720 --> 37:44.000
<i>In my past life, I played songs first</i>

37:44.080 --> 37:46.840
<i>And provoked Mu Yao</i>

37:47.120 --> 37:48.840
<i>But that caused me a lot of trouble.</i>

37:49.400 --> 37:53.400
<i>This time we'll help you make her famous</i>

37:53.480 --> 37:55.880
<i>So she doesn't have to use me.</i>

38:04.320 --> 38:06.200
There is so much talent in your abode.

38:06.280 --> 38:08.480
Even a simple maid can play such beautiful music.

38:08.560 --> 38:10.160
Its amazing.

38:10.600 --> 38:11.760
You are praising her.

38:12.120 --> 38:14.040
Her playing is very average.

38:14.120 --> 38:15.440
you're welcome.

38:16.400 --> 38:17.840
the music this woman played

38:17.920 --> 38:19.800
It conveys the heroic spirit of soldiers.

38:20.960 --> 38:22.560
Even famous musicians

38:22.640 --> 38:23.960
Not as good as her.

38:25.200 --> 38:26.600
It's just normal to me.

38:29.440 --> 38:30.960
then...

38:31.280 --> 38:32.560
Why don't you give her to me?

38:34.000 --> 38:35.120
My mom likes music.

38:35.200 --> 38:36.840
She can relieve boredom.

38:44.320 --> 38:46.200
<i>Bonus video</i>

38:53.280 --> 38:54.880
Bodyguard selection is over

38:54.960 --> 38:56.840
G. Butler picked the agile ones.

38:57.720 --> 38:59.080
Are any of them talented?

39:05.200 --> 39:06.680
when i was watching

39:07.000 --> 39:08.760
I found a nimble man.

39:09.080 --> 39:10.960
I don't think I learned any martial arts.

39:11.040 --> 39:13.160
But he could handle the pros very well.

39:13.720 --> 39:16.200
Does that make him a natural martial artist?

39:17.800 --> 39:19.880
Rather

39:20.080 --> 39:21.960
Rather, it felt like I was risking my life.

39:22.440 --> 39:24.200
No matter how strong the opponent is

39:24.280 --> 39:25.880
They will inevitably feel a little afraid

39:25.960 --> 39:28.200
When I fought him.

39:28.280 --> 39:29.760
who. Put him down.

39:32.440 --> 39:33.480
OK.

39:33.920 --> 39:35.520
Just go in and register.

39:35.800 --> 39:38.000
From now on, you will be living in the security room.

39:39.400 --> 39:40.440
Thank you, Deacon Ji.

39:40.760 --> 39:44.200
Coach him later.

39:45.080 --> 39:46.440
If you have a personality like this

39:46.520 --> 39:47.840
really you can use

39:47.920 --> 39:50.920
He will never betray you.

39:51.720 --> 39:52.720
famous.

39:56.560 --> 39:57.600
wait.

40:01.280 --> 40:02.400
What is your name?

40:04.640 --> 40:05.720
Huarongzhou.
