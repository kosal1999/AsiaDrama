02:27.159 --> 02:28.520
What should I give?

02:29.960 --> 02:32.320
If it were an ordinary girl

02:32.320 --> 02:34.600
Gifts are usually accessories or clothing.

02:34.600 --> 02:36.640
But for people like Mrs.

You might consider giving her a sword or a horse.

There are many treasures given by the palace

02:40.959 --> 02:42.620

03:25.319 --> 03:26.340
Really sorry. I am really sorry.

03:26.340 --> 03:27.680
I tried to avoid the cats.

03:27.680 --> 03:29.240
I didn't mean to hit you.

03:44.639 --> 03:46.159

Isn’t it delicious?

04:13.280 --> 04:15.280

I am really sorry.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.480
- I'll get it for you.

04:23.439 --> 04:24.920
Look what you did!

05:07.600 --> 05:09.408
It didn't look familiar to me. Are you new here?

05:10.639 --> 05:13.440
I'd like to see what you mentioned.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.240
I mean, guess and take it? We are preparing.

05:15.800 --> 05:17.020
They need to wait a moment.

05:36.079 --> 05:37.480
Place your bet now.

05:37.480 --> 05:38.660
But I'm going to bet on him.

05:38.660 --> 05:40.180

05:46.660 --> 05:48.160

05:59.000 --> 06:00.064
Eat quickly.

06:01.680 --> 06:02.800
The man is holding a cat.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.728
This outfit looks familiar to me.

06:05.728 --> 06:06.800
Place your bets!

06:06.800 --> 06:07.920
I'd still bet on this.

06:09.759 --> 06:10.784
Thousands!

06:11.879 --> 06:12.960
The one with the cat!

06:13.600 --> 06:15.720
Place your bet now.

06:17.079 --> 06:19.680
Do I need to pay to sit here?

06:20.199 --> 06:22.799
Clear. Are you here to make money?

06:22.799 --> 06:24.399
They need to get money
to place bets.

06:25.560 --> 06:27.340
Hurry up and place your bets.

06:27.340 --> 06:28.448
We'll wait here.

06:29.160 --> 06:30.752
- Get the money out quickly.

06:31.584 --> 06:33.600
Are you new here? follow me.

06:42.160 --> 06:43.264

06:45.120 --> 06:46.519

06:51.319 --> 06:53.580
Some people just have bad luck.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.419
It’s better to go all-in or go all-in.

06:55.419 --> 06:56.500
- It is not?
- Exactly.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.680
what do you know?

06:57.680 --> 07:00.399
I'll tell you what luck is.

07:01.519 --> 07:02.900

07:06.459 --> 07:08.000
- Place your bets.
- Open it!

07:08.519 --> 07:09.600
hurry up. Open! Open!

07:10.360 --> 07:13.079
Master, I accidentally knocked over a vegetable stall.

07:13.856 --> 07:14.880
Master?

07:15.424 --> 07:17.439
Master! Master!

07:30.000 --> 07:31.560
- Good luck.
- let's go!

07:31.560 --> 07:33.399
Place your bets!

07:33.920 --> 07:35.359
Where should I bet?

07:35.359 --> 07:37.280
Let me tell you, I feel lucky today.

07:37.280 --> 07:38.760
Do you have more money? In the next round,

07:38.760 --> 07:40.120
I'll help you turn things around.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.416
Stop arguing. Come on, bet.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.048
Who should I bet on?

07:46.759 --> 07:48.039
This is of great value.

07:48.039 --> 07:49.560
- Very valuable.
- No, not this.

07:49.560 --> 07:51.319
this is not. You can't touch.

07:51.319 --> 07:52.352
You can't touch.

07:54.720 --> 07:57.380
Final decision, no regrets.
These are casino rules.

07:57.380 --> 07:59.560
He hasn't gambled yet.

07:59.560 --> 08:02.912
Every piece of land is important. Choose one to place your bet.

08:03.519 --> 08:04.759
He must be new here.

08:04.759 --> 08:06.760
As I said, you can only place your bets.

08:06.760 --> 08:07.879
You can't go back.

08:08.439 --> 08:09.504
I do not want.

08:13.480 --> 08:15.040
He shouldn't be here.

08:15.040 --> 08:16.096
Exactly.

08:16.879 --> 08:18.240
Really sorry.

08:18.240 --> 08:19.680
thousand,

08:19.680 --> 08:22.060
The place is supported by the Prince Regent.

08:22.060 --> 08:23.639
Better not to waste time.

08:23.639 --> 08:24.880
Otherwise you will get beaten.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.688
If you don’t want to lose, win back.

08:26.688 --> 08:27.712
correct?

08:27.712 --> 08:29.820
Always small.
Maybe I should bet on Big now.

08:29.820 --> 08:31.000
Apostasy is no big deal.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.779
Master, why don’t you place your bet quickly?

08:33.779 --> 08:35.639
Maybe I'll win this round.

08:35.639 --> 08:36.760
Then, they equalized.

08:36.760 --> 08:37.900
That's right, Master.

08:37.900 --> 08:39.300
Place your bet now.

08:39.300 --> 08:40.480
Okay, Master.

08:41.279 --> 08:42.336
Place your bet now.

08:42.840 --> 08:43.940
let's go. Open!

08:43.940 --> 08:45.159
Abram!

08:50.519 --> 08:52.480
Master, have you decided?

08:53.000 --> 08:54.720
Don't rush him.

09:01.399 --> 09:02.464
What is he writing?

09:04.879 --> 09:06.399
I forgot one.

09:07.399 --> 09:08.740
Where should I put it?

09:08.740 --> 09:12.240
Brother, do you really want to exchange one jade slip for five?

09:13.279 --> 09:14.600
Can I exchange for more?

09:15.279 --> 09:16.799
may be.

09:16.799 --> 09:17.799
But let's forget.

09:17.799 --> 09:18.840
Let's make a bet first.

09:18.840 --> 09:20.300
Let's put this first. Come on, dealer.

09:20.300 --> 09:21.620
Open! Open!

09:21.620 --> 09:22.959
let's go. Let's open it.

09:22.959 --> 09:24.120
Abra!

09:26.159 --> 09:27.200
you win!

09:27.200 --> 09:28.260
He is a lucky man.

09:28.260 --> 09:30.144
you win!

09:30.759 --> 09:31.872
You are very good.

09:35.720 --> 09:37.040
What's the use of money?

09:37.040 --> 09:38.140
Is this all it has to offer?

09:38.140 --> 09:40.080
Gold has a price, but jade is priceless.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.040
Even the worst quality is worth it

09:42.040 --> 09:44.159
My bar, my rules.

09:45.159 --> 09:47.320
How can I have more?

09:50.600 --> 09:52.120
I'm angry.

09:55.759 --> 09:56.832
Miss,

09:58.120 --> 09:59.519
The young master disappeared again.

09:59.519 --> 10:01.760
But whenever he disappears, he comes to see you.

10:01.760 --> 10:03.519
However, this time you are in the mansion.

10:04.840 --> 10:06.860
It's best not to tell Mr. Rong.

10:06.860 --> 10:08.000
Where did he go?

10:08.000 --> 10:09.080
Let's go find him separately.

10:09.080 --> 10:10.176
he's good.

10:13.159 --> 10:14.660
Place your bets. let's go.

10:14.660 --> 10:16.060
Where will we place our bets?

10:16.060 --> 10:17.280
- etc.
- Place your bets quickly.

10:17.280 --> 10:18.580
- wait.
- Open it!

10:18.580 --> 10:19.679
Open! Open!

10:21.216 --> 10:22.272
we won!

10:22.799 --> 10:24.100
Ten times more!

10:24.100 --> 10:25.920
Pay ten. Dealer, pay up.

10:25.920 --> 10:27.279
Pay! Pay!

10:28.279 --> 10:29.344
They are ours now.

10:57.279 --> 10:58.279
look at this.

10:58.840 --> 11:00.099
If we follow them, we too will win.

11:00.099 --> 11:01.360
They won so much!

11:03.600 --> 11:04.680
This is a huge pile!

11:04.680 --> 11:06.159
They are very lucky.

11:06.159 --> 11:07.340
Are you cheating?

11:07.340 --> 11:08.352
What?

11:09.360 --> 11:10.480
Don't play dumb.

11:11.279 --> 11:12.440
He must have cheated.

11:12.440 --> 11:13.640
The results of dice are unpredictable.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.480
And you win them all.

11:16.039 --> 11:17.159
I just can do it.

11:17.919 --> 11:20.920
The data is in your hands.

11:20.920 --> 11:22.879
How could he cheat? Haven't read them.

11:24.120 --> 11:27.020
The man said that young people playing with cats
cannot afford it.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.400
Now that he won, they started accusing him of cheating.

11:29.400 --> 11:31.580
I guess you're the one who can't afford it.

11:31.580 --> 11:32.919
- Yes or no?
- correct.

11:32.919 --> 11:34.160
quickly.

11:34.160 --> 11:35.360
The door is almost open.

11:35.360 --> 11:36.400
That. Open it.

11:36.400 --> 11:37.860
Open immediately.

11:37.860 --> 11:39.400
Abra!

11:39.400 --> 11:40.519
Soon. Open it!

11:40.519 --> 11:42.699

11:50.840 --> 11:51.872
You can place your bet now.

11:52.559 --> 11:53.600
what do you think?

11:55.159 --> 11:56.679
I'm not betting on this round.

11:57.919 --> 12:00.140
No? Why not place your bet now?

12:00.140 --> 12:02.360
Don't you bet with your friends?

12:03.008 --> 12:04.096
But in fact, it's not.

12:04.639 --> 12:06.640
Or is it because you can't cheat?

12:06.640 --> 12:07.720
wait. because

12:07.720 --> 12:09.240
Isn't that okay if he doesn't want to gamble?

12:09.240 --> 12:10.879
That's because you have something in your hand.

12:11.720 --> 12:12.940
I do not know why,

12:12.940 --> 12:14.639
But suddenly he hid it in his hand.

12:15.279 --> 12:16.639
What nonsense is this?

12:16.639 --> 12:17.820
He has something in his hand. check.

Take a good look at him.

14:54.016 --> 14:55.712
Head down, unharmed.

14:55.712 --> 14:56.800
He cannot be underestimated.

14:57.320 --> 14:58.368
Exactly.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.779
Don't fight me.

15:18.779 --> 15:20.200
leave! Walk!

15:21.120 --> 15:22.419
We are not on the same side.

15:22.419 --> 15:23.440
leave!

15:24.399 --> 15:26.759
Don't fight with me. Give me that.

15:27.440 --> 15:28.448
Give me that.

15:30.240 --> 15:31.260
They are mine.

15:31.260 --> 15:32.288
They are mine.

15:36.519 --> 15:37.720
It's scary.

15:37.720 --> 15:38.880
One person was murdered.

15:43.879 --> 15:45.279
running. One person was murdered.

16:03.840 --> 16:05.279
what are you doing here?

16:06.519 --> 16:08.440
I found a cat.

16:09.840 --> 16:10.912
Where is the cat?

16:15.360 --> 16:16.480
hold me.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.056
Rong Yu,

16:39.120 --> 16:40.128
Here we are.

16:40.720 --> 16:41.792
No.

16:49.919 --> 16:50.976
Master, you are back.

16:51.919 --> 16:53.280
Quickly help him dismount.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.399
Master, please.

17:03.159 --> 17:04.599
Master, please dismount.

17:14.079 --> 17:15.839
Master!

17:16.480 --> 17:17.599
Master,

17:18.359 --> 17:19.424
Master Rong is looking for you.

17:21.880 --> 17:22.944
This way.

17:28.720 --> 17:29.856
let's go.

17:51.720 --> 17:54.079
How about a class at an astrology studio?

17:54.680 --> 17:56.000
This is good.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.920
I get along well with everyone.

18:02.359 --> 18:05.600
A young psychic gave me candy today

18:05.600 --> 18:07.599
And asked me if I
had mastered the Chinese characters I learned.

18:08.799 --> 18:09.824
So, are you dominant?

18:16.920 --> 18:17.984
everything is fine.

18:19.359 --> 18:20.384
this is not your fault.

18:23.240 --> 18:25.519
I heard that there is a master in the West,

18:26.039 --> 18:27.679
I have sent someone to invite you.

18:27.679 --> 18:28.880
It will arrive in a few days.

18:28.880 --> 18:31.759
Maybe there will be a good solution this time.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.359
he's good.

18:35.359 --> 18:37.240
You can go and rest first.

18:39.799 --> 18:40.832
At

18:43.839 --> 18:45.079
Have you seen the jade jewelry?

18:46.000 --> 18:47.008
What have I left here?

18:49.720 --> 18:50.784
That's what the He family is like.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.279
I have not seen.

18:57.920 --> 18:59.880
I'll keep looking.

19:01.640 --> 19:02.759
You can go back first.

19:19.440 --> 19:20.448
Master,

19:22.279 --> 19:24.119
Can you notify me in advance when you go out again?

19:25.599 --> 19:29.000
Sorry, I didn't know I would get this far.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.080
Why is there so much gold and silver?

19:32.080 --> 19:33.519
In the book basket, Master?

19:33.519 --> 19:35.260
There is a cat at the moment.

19:35.260 --> 19:37.039
He ran away before I could catch him.

19:37.039 --> 19:38.160
European Union...

19:38.160 --> 19:40.760
I just... like...

19:40.760 --> 19:42.559
And then that's it.

19:44.319 --> 19:46.279
So I have it all.

19:47.640 --> 19:49.440
Why are you hitting yourself?

19:54.880 --> 19:55.936
Jiuling!

19:59.319 --> 20:01.000
I would live in the house next door.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.240
Cleaning up the outside tonight.

20:27.559 --> 20:28.640
excuse me.

20:30.720 --> 20:33.079
Is it because I worried you today?

20:35.616 --> 20:36.699
No.

20:36.699 --> 20:39.960
Is it because sometimes
I wake up at dawn to disturb you?

20:41.039 --> 20:42.480
- No.
- Then why?

20:44.240 --> 20:45.959
Don't worry.

20:45.959 --> 20:47.659
It's hot here.

20:47.659 --> 20:49.400
I'll be fine.

20:52.079 --> 20:55.559
I just want to be alone for a while.

21:03.839 --> 21:06.079
Master, what's wrong with your lady?

21:07.319 --> 21:08.759
Why did she move here with her quilt?

21:11.400 --> 21:13.480
It must be because

21:13.480 --> 21:15.160
I upset her today.

21:15.680 --> 21:18.359
It must have nothing to do with you.

21:40.480 --> 21:41.536
Where is Heshan?

21:42.559 --> 21:44.880
Ferida del Salu?

21:45.920 --> 21:47.680
He returned to his hometown.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.480
He was chosen.

21:51.680 --> 21:53.460
No, he had been sick for several days.

21:53.460 --> 21:56.459
He didn't tell you personally,

21:56.459 --> 21:58.159
Make you worry like this.

21:58.159 --> 22:00.140
Not very good?

22:00.140 --> 22:01.519
What's so great about this?

22:02.079 --> 22:03.960
At least he still had a home to go back to.

22:05.400 --> 22:08.119
But Jiuling no longer has any family.

22:08.759 --> 22:12.040
After death, we will never see you again.

22:12.040 --> 22:14.279
But we didn't find it anywhere.

22:16.039 --> 22:18.920
And I did nothing right.

22:20.880 --> 22:22.400
It would be great if Heshan was here

22:22.960 --> 22:25.200
He is smart and knows what to do.

22:25.720 --> 22:27.140
But that's not right.

22:27.140 --> 22:28.559
Is there anything wrong?

22:28.559 --> 22:29.980
I'm not doing things right

22:29.980 --> 22:31.380
Then I do nothing?

22:31.380 --> 22:32.448
this is not right.

That's my fault. I accidentally fell down.

Cover well.

We Rong people are prophets

I had to

25:43.680 --> 25:45.599
Afraid that something bad would happen to him.

I've had it for 20 years

25:55.720 --> 25:57.839
I never let him get hurt.

He is the future of our family.

26:01.920 --> 26:03.319

26:03.319 --> 26:06.659
Even though he is still the Lord of the Stars,

26:06.659 --> 26:07.744
you will be happy

Including my life.

That doesn't change the fact that you are his enemy.

I have one more question.

27:11.640 --> 27:12.960
Although I already have the answer

27:14.119 --> 27:15.359
I still want to ask.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.000
This is the poison you gave Rong Yu

What made him like this?

Could something so terrible happen in the future?

29:19.120 --> 29:21.640
Is it really worth it for this fish?

29:21.640 --> 29:25.559
It is said that this fish was given by the emperor,
so it is very magical.

No, Jiuling and I will eat together later.

You will catch a cold.

35:13.280 --> 35:14.799

Who cares what day it is?
Stop hanging around here.

35:27.460 --> 35:29.000
go to sleep.

They are all made by me.

35:57.079 --> 35:59.584
Happy birthday, my bunny.

36:10.639 --> 36:12.480
wish you more happiness

36:12.480 --> 36:14.200
and more happiness.

36:14.200 --> 36:16.880
Today when Zhanping and I went to buy lanterns,

36:16.880 --> 36:18.220
people there say

36:18.220 --> 36:20.459
Fish in the lake
can bring good luck.

36:20.459 --> 36:22.599
So I went fishing.

36:29.320 --> 36:30.400
you fell into the lake

36:31.039 --> 36:32.039
that's why?

36:33.639 --> 36:36.060
I was only half wet. all good.

36:36.060 --> 36:38.760
And the fish was caught immediately.

36:38.760 --> 36:40.400
Can't even flatten it.

36:46.920 --> 36:49.920
Still unhappy?

36:50.760 --> 36:53.400
How do these things make me happy?

36:56.800 --> 37:01.491
♫ When the sun sets at dusk♫

37:03.712 --> 37:09.511
♫I traveled thousands of miles♫

37:09.511 --> 37:16.481
♫ Play the sitar under the moonlight ♫

37:17.695 --> 37:23.867
♫ Drinks won’t let me forget ♫

37:24.832 --> 37:30.820
♫I write to you about my desire♫

37:31.936 --> 37:37.476
♫Our destiny is written on paper♫

37:37.476 --> 37:41.775
♫ Like the strongest wine ♫

37:41.775 --> 37:45.190
♫ There is no escape from fate ♫

37:46.112 --> 37:52.196
♫Looking back I see you waiting♫

37:52.196 --> 37:59.364
♫Our lives are full of
joy and sadness♫

37:59.364 --> 38:06.299
♫ Desire crystallizes
into shining stars♫

38:06.299 --> 38:14.116
♫ You turn around silently
and close the wedding book♫

38:14.116 --> 38:19.716
♫Ask how many stars there are in the sky♫

38:45.952 --> 38:51.524
♫I write to you about my desire♫

38:53.088 --> 38:58.692
♫Our destiny is written on paper♫

38:58.692 --> 39:02.726
♫ Like the strongest wine ♫

39:03.136 --> 39:05.668
♫ There is no escape from fate ♫

39:07.232 --> 39:13.284
♫Looking back I see you waiting♫

39:13.284 --> 39:20.324
♫Our lives are full of
joy and sadness♫

39:20.324 --> 39:27.521
♫ Desire crystallizes
into shining stars♫

39:27.525 --> 39:34.788
♫I play the sitar softly
waiting for someone like you♫

39:35.392 --> 39:41.552
♫In the end you
are my inevitable destiny♫
